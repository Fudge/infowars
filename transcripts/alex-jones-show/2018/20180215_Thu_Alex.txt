[00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.173]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:17.536]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:33.547]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:45.219]  Yet again we are seeing total information overload, vicious massacres, 17 dead, dozens more wounded at a Florida high school.
[00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.203]  We of course were covering it live yesterday right to the evening as it unfolded.
[00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:52.244]  There are now so many angles to this.
[00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:58.869]  You've got the hero coach now confirmed running into the hail of gunfire, saving many people and being killed.
[00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.811]  You've got
[00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:07.637]  The police responding pretty quickly compared to a lot of other situations that we've seen like this.
[00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:17.205]  We've got Salon and CNN and others saying that Trump blamed the victims when he simply tweeted, wow, there were a lot of warning signs.
[00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:18.446]  Everybody warned about it.
[00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:21.149]  That's exactly what the students and everybody are saying.
[00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.334]  But we have a very credible eyewitness and this story broke.
[00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:40.183]  On KHOU, a very credible Houston television program, last night with their top sports reporter who was there covering big baseball tryouts there in Miami.
[00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:55.172]  And he went over to the school to cover it live with all the national television, Matt Musel, and he talked to one particular witness, and others as well, that said that they were hearing shots
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:12.960]  Coming from another area of the school at different times, but this witness particularly was saying that she knew him from the year before when he's still being in school, thought he was a weirdo and said, I'm surprised it's not you that did this.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.303]  And he looked at her like he was surprised while they heard
[00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:17.810]  Shots going off.
[00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.891]  Alexa Meednik is her name.
[00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:21.992]  We're trying to get her on the broadcast right now.
[00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:29.136]  And at first, the reporter said, I've shot these interviews, it's going to be airing on the news coming up later when he was live.
[00:02:30.176 --> 00:02:30.916]  It never aired.
[00:02:31.037 --> 00:02:37.200]  Then the reporter, late at night, later in the evening, tweeted his interview with her.
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.461]  So he obviously thinks this was important.
[00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.022]  This has spiked written all over it.
[00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:42.883]  She's very credible.
[00:02:44.258 --> 00:02:45.059]  She's well-spoken.
[00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:45.960]  She's attractive.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.042]  She's a senior there at the school.
[00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:49.984]  He was a senior last year.
[00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.828]  She said she saw him and thought, are you the one shooting everybody?
[00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.290]  There he is.
[00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.331]  No guns in his hands.
[00:02:57.732 --> 00:02:58.253]  No nothing.
[00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:02.477]  And there's shots going off down and around the hall.
[00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.640]  That video is all coming up.
[00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:06.949]  This is a big deal.
[00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.572]  Just like we had reports of second shooters in Vegas.
[00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:18.198]  We had reports from the hostage rescue team that he'd been in the Middle East and had women in the room and had ISIS paraphernalia and it was a gun deal gone bad.
[00:03:19.212 --> 00:03:20.853]  That there was Saudis visiting town.
[00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:23.853]  We broke that all in the first few days.
[00:03:24.314 --> 00:03:25.254]  It all came out later.
[00:03:25.374 --> 00:03:26.894]  But the official story isn't true.
[00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:36.397]  We just don't know exactly what happened, but it all points towards what our sources in Army Special Operations and the FBI and others have told us that are good men.
[00:03:37.177 --> 00:03:39.058]  And it's been golden information we've gotten.
[00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:51.492]  Everybody knows I've been critical of the Clinton-controlled and Obama-controlled FBI at the top, but over the years it's been federal marshals, FBI, and others that have given us much of our critical information to be aware of what's going on.
[00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:54.033]  Who do you think gave us all the MIAC documents and reports?
[00:03:54.213 --> 00:03:54.713]  Law enforcement.
[00:03:55.253 --> 00:03:57.074]  Where they were trained to take on gun owners and veterans.
[00:03:57.814 --> 00:04:00.094]  The media spun that, that I was against the military.
[00:04:00.134 --> 00:04:02.175]  No, it was the military did not want to be trained to do this.
[00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:04.415]  Show that they were the whistleblowers.
[00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:06.336]  So that's coming up, the President's statement.
[00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:07.896]  And more.
[00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:11.478]  But this is a big, big deal, and they do not want you to hear this.
[00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.299]  They do not want this video to get out.
[00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.300]  This is getting no coverage.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.403]  I mean, I figured last night, when I saw Rob Dew tweet about it at 9 at night, I figured people would be all over this.
[00:04:21.463 --> 00:04:24.104]  And then this morning, I looked, and it was just nowhere.
[00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:32.349]  Just nowhere to have a credible witness that knew him and is walking down the hall when the sirens are going off and there's shooting going on.
[00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.370]  And she thought, I thought it'd be you being the shooter.
[00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.950]  And he's like, what?
[00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:38.645]  And the guy looks like he's drugged up out of his mind.
[00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:42.950]  I mean, he's got mind control written all over him, just like Paddock did.
[00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.136]  Oh, that's now come out in mainstream news, that Paddock believed he was under mind control and begged people for help.
[00:04:51.018 --> 00:04:53.801]  And of course, Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, was under MKUltra.
[00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.644]  That's been declassified, but got almost no attention.
[00:04:57.144 --> 00:04:57.665]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.685 --> 00:04:58.686]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:58.746 --> 00:04:59.487]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.352]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:05.992 --> 00:05:09.535]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:12.918]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:15.280]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:20.245]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:05:20.565 --> 00:05:22.647]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:29.313]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:37.138]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:42.782]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:05:43.183 --> 00:05:50.148]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:55.269]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.550]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.350]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.130]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.215 --> 00:06:27.276]  Thursday, the 15th day of February 2018.
[00:06:27.316 --> 00:06:29.336]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:31.997]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:06:32.757 --> 00:06:33.917]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us.
[00:06:33.957 --> 00:06:41.539]  He obviously lives right outside the area where the mass shooting took place yesterday in Florida.
[00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:46.880]  And he has family in law enforcement that he doesn't name that he has great sources with.
[00:06:47.621 --> 00:06:52.662]  And so we're going to be having exclusive information for you coming up, including
[00:06:53.562 --> 00:06:59.006]  Some of the top leaders in state government are going to be popping in during the transmission today.
[00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:07.472]  Now I want to be clear when I get into this information that I'm not saying the local sheriff's department or the police department is involved in a cover-up.
[00:07:08.853 --> 00:07:12.095]  I am not saying that this isn't a real shooting.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:24.865]  I am not saying that the bizarre looking reported shooter who looks crazier than a you-know-what house rat might not have been involved and might not have carried out these operations.
[00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:30.087]  Can we put grudgereport.com up on screen for folks so people can see the reported suspect please?
[00:07:30.127 --> 00:07:30.487]  Thank you.
[00:07:30.947 --> 00:07:34.129]  FBI was warned and we know that
[00:07:39.482 --> 00:07:45.328]  The FBI had been calling him for his threats on YouTube and other statements and nothing was done.
[00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:51.856]  Trump came out and tweeted yesterday and pointed out that
[00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:54.616]  There's all these warnings.
[00:07:54.956 --> 00:07:55.956]  Why aren't things done?
[00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.578]  Over and over again, there's warnings from these people.
[00:07:58.038 --> 00:08:04.322]  The media, CNN, Salon, all the Soros-run groups, said that Trump was blaming the victims.
[00:08:04.362 --> 00:08:07.744]  No, he was saying the victims are saying they warned.
[00:08:08.284 --> 00:08:09.285]  Why weren't they listened to?
[00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:10.166]  It's the opposite.
[00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:15.466]  So it's by extension the media's blaming the victims by saying Trump is.
[00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:16.946]  No one ever proposed that.
[00:08:17.266 --> 00:08:18.327]  No one ever said that.
[00:08:18.607 --> 00:08:19.687]  No one ever floated that.
[00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:24.289]  But that's the alchemy of CNN and MSNBC and others and Salon.
[00:08:24.549 --> 00:08:25.649]  We've got clips of all of them.
[00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:33.292]  Taking what Trump said that made total sense, misconstruing it, and then bringing up a topic that didn't exist before.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:41.266]  Now that said, the reason I pointed out that I'm not saying that local law enforcement's involved in a cover-up, I'm not saying any of that.
[00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:50.994]  I'm saying we have a very credible Houston reporter that's the head sports reporter for KHOU out of Houston, who was there covering baseball tryouts.
[00:08:52.543 --> 00:08:56.444]  And he ran over there to cover it, and he talked to witnesses that reported hearing two shooters.
[00:08:56.584 --> 00:08:57.144]  I've looked it up.
[00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:58.044]  We've got the videos.
[00:08:58.084 --> 00:09:05.305]  And one particular witness we're going to play the video of coming up after we have the President's response that just happened about 45 minutes ago, or about 35 minutes ago.
[00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:15.627]  We have credible witnesses, and one particular witness that said, I knew the shooter, or the supposed shooter, Mr. Cruz.
[00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:17.348]  He's walking down the hall.
[00:09:17.388 --> 00:09:18.168]  He doesn't have a gun.
[00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:20.545]  She says, oh, it's not you.
[00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:21.786]  I thought you'd be the mass shooter.
[00:09:21.806 --> 00:09:22.907]  Everybody thought you'd be the mass shooter.
[00:09:23.628 --> 00:09:25.229]  Because he was kind of the perfect cutout.
[00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:26.830]  Or Patsy, if that's happened.
[00:09:27.851 --> 00:09:31.234]  And she hears shots going off down the hall, and he looks dumbfounded.
[00:09:31.254 --> 00:09:33.255]  He looks poleaxed.
[00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:35.377]  He looks like he's been struck by a bolt of lightning.
[00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:35.798]  Like, huh?
[00:09:36.138 --> 00:09:37.379]  A good-looking girl's talking to me.
[00:09:39.582 --> 00:09:48.324]  So, he has all the characteristics of being some type of autism spectrum individual, and you look at that thousand-yard stare right there, who knows?
[00:09:48.364 --> 00:09:49.064]  Was he involved?
[00:09:49.124 --> 00:09:49.404]  Maybe.
[00:09:50.004 --> 00:09:59.926]  But just like we had all the tell-tale signs of Vegas, and just like that all turned out to be a lie, we now have the huge news on Infowars.com.
[00:10:00.246 --> 00:10:04.667]  This is an exclusive in news, other than KHOU, because KHOU covered it.
[00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:09.958]  Said it was coming up at 10 o'clock with an interview and they never aired it, but the reporter put it out on his Twitter.
[00:10:10.539 --> 00:10:12.081]  So, this is big.
[00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:14.023]  She knew the shooter.
[00:10:14.584 --> 00:10:16.266]  Thought he'd be the one doing the shooting.
[00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:18.229]  The reported shooter.
[00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:23.971]  So that is massive information and we're going to play those clips right now.
[00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:29.172]  Then I'm going to come back and we're going to get into the president's response and more.
[00:10:29.192 --> 00:10:37.215]  We're going to open the phones up and get your take on this, particularly folks that are nearby the Douglas High School shooting.
[00:10:38.962 --> 00:10:43.365]  We're going to be looking at every facet of this.
[00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:45.026]  Also, I've seen a bunch of headlines.
[00:10:45.107 --> 00:10:48.189]  Biggest massacre, biggest shooting in Florida history.
[00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:49.610]  This is 17 dead.
[00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.312]  The Pulse nightclub in Orlando was more than 50.
[00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:59.117]  And of course that doesn't take away from the dead or the wounded or the families and how terrible this is and our hearts go out to them.
[00:11:00.276 --> 00:11:26.330]  It's just that with a history of cover-ups, and a history of patsies being protected by criminal rogue groups, and the history of the Democrats staging false flag events, CNN staging fake news, they're very famous for that, staging scud missile attacks on Riyadh that never happened, from on top of their Atlanta center with blue screens, the babies in the incubators being thrown out to get us into the Iraq War in 1990, none of that was true, that's been declassified to be fraudulent.
[00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.392]  So we have to look at each event to see if they're
[00:11:30.072 --> 00:11:32.853]  Lying about the event to see if they're covering it up.
[00:11:32.953 --> 00:11:33.854]  Is it totally fake?
[00:11:34.134 --> 00:11:35.794]  Is it real but there's others involved?
[00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:43.718]  Or maybe a mentally ill person was wound up and allowed to take action and so by knowing and doing nothing it makes you an accomplice?
[00:11:44.198 --> 00:11:59.324]  When you've got CIA and globalists all over TV saying, you better not send this memo to the American people about the corruption in the FBI or there'll be massacres.
[00:12:00.776 --> 00:12:03.379]  And then you've got Republicans that are getting shot and attempted massacres.
[00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:09.665]  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, I've been saying, I think there'll be mass attacks on schools to be blamed on Trump.
[00:12:09.725 --> 00:12:11.287]  I mean, this is, this is all they've got left.
[00:12:13.115 --> 00:12:41.406]  So, I'm not saying it's a false flag, but you've got witnesses of other shooters, and that the shooter didn't have a gun, and that he wasn't doing this, the person they tell us is the shooter, and then you don't have that being a bigger issue with this credible witness who's a senior in the high school that says she knew him and thought it would be him doing it, but it wasn't him doing it, and the fact that the reporter thinks it's huge news, but it doesn't air on the news that night, he mentions it's coming up, he has the interview, and then he has to put it out on Twitter himself,
[00:12:42.566 --> 00:12:47.989]  We need to get Matt Musil on the program, on the broadcast 10-4 immediately.
[00:12:48.989 --> 00:12:49.950]  We need to get him on now.
[00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.092]  So we're trying to reach out to him and Alexa Mednik.
[00:12:54.673 --> 00:13:02.317]  So let's go ahead and play first the reporter earlier live on KHOU and then he's singing in for the news coming up.
[00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:05.478]  They got to get all the interviews packaged and satellited back to Houston.
[00:13:05.838 --> 00:13:07.499]  He's saying we're going to have this incredible interview.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.520]  They didn't air it.
[00:13:10.169 --> 00:13:11.710]  Uh, but then he did on his own Twitter.
[00:13:11.871 --> 00:13:12.531]  That right there.
[00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:13.852]  This is very newsworthy.
[00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:15.614]  And this hasn't been picked up anywhere.
[00:13:15.734 --> 00:13:17.315]  I thought it'd be all over the place by this morning.
[00:13:18.336 --> 00:13:19.597]  Our people tweeted it out last night.
[00:13:19.637 --> 00:13:20.478]  They were all exhausted.
[00:13:20.558 --> 00:13:22.039]  I was gonna drive in at like 8 at night.
[00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:24.981]  I said, dude, he's like, what are you up to?
[00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:26.382]  He goes, I'm sleeping on the couch for 30 minutes.
[00:13:26.422 --> 00:13:27.403]  I said, go home to your wife.
[00:13:27.663 --> 00:13:28.424]  We'll cover it tomorrow.
[00:13:28.844 --> 00:13:30.706]  I didn't care if everybody else scooped us on this.
[00:13:30.826 --> 00:13:31.767]  I figured it would have been covered.
[00:13:32.247 --> 00:13:33.008]  It didn't get covered.
[00:13:33.368 --> 00:13:35.810]  Daria's texting me at one of the producers at 8 a.m.
[00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.872]  saying, we haven't covered this, have you seen this?
[00:13:38.392 --> 00:13:40.714]  So thank God she did, and Kit Daniels put a story out on it.
[00:13:41.074 --> 00:13:42.155]  They don't want this getting out.
[00:13:42.195 --> 00:13:47.299]  It's on Infowars.com, then Newswars.com, a Kit Daniels article with all the video right now.
[00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:49.781]  Video, second shooter reported in Florida massacre.
[00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:57.647]  Here is the sports reporter who was in Miami for baseball tryout coverage reporting, and then we'll show you the actual report they don't want you to see.
[00:13:58.547 --> 00:13:59.628]  They're all in shock.
[00:13:59.648 --> 00:14:00.668]  Let me just tell you this.
[00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:03.789]  We just spoke with a former student, Alexa Medick.
[00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:11.233]  She actually walked down the hall with the accused shooter, Nicholas Cruz, after she heard shots fired.
[00:14:11.653 --> 00:14:14.594]  She said, hey, Nicholas, this is what she told me on camera.
[00:14:14.614 --> 00:14:16.095]  We will have it for a 10 o'clock show.
[00:14:16.115 --> 00:14:18.456]  She said, hey, I just heard shots fired.
[00:14:18.496 --> 00:14:19.637]  I'm surprised it wasn't you.
[00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:20.937]  Just kidding like that.
[00:14:20.957 --> 00:14:22.258]  He had this reaction.
[00:14:22.338 --> 00:14:22.578]  What?
[00:14:22.998 --> 00:14:24.539]  And then they parted ways.
[00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:26.539]  She said, I heard more shots after that.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.680]  She thinks there was a second shooter.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.142]  That's the first we've heard of that, but she believes there was actually a second shooter.
[00:14:33.162 --> 00:14:34.942]  Okay, now let's go to this as we go to break.
[00:14:35.303 --> 00:14:37.523]  Here she is later, but this didn't show up in the news.
[00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:38.524]  You had to put it on Twitter.
[00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:38.824]  Here it is.
[00:14:40.554 --> 00:14:55.980]  I actually was in the bathroom at the moment and I came back to my classroom and I knocked on the door and the fire alarm went off and the principal came on the speaker and just said, everyone needs to evacuate right now.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.181]  So that's what we did.
[00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:01.662]  As I was going down the stairs, I heard a couple shots fired.
[00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:03.283]  Everyone was freaking out.
[00:15:03.923 --> 00:15:05.245]  Saying that it was a gun.
[00:15:06.127 --> 00:15:14.901]  And as we were walking the whole class together, I actually was speaking to the suspect, Nicholas Cruz.
[00:15:16.323 --> 00:15:18.026]  And as I was speaking to him,
[00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:26.262]  He seemed very... I don't know what the word I want to say is, but he was trouble in middle school.
[00:15:26.302 --> 00:15:31.004]  So I kind of joked to him about it and said, I'm surprised you weren't the one who did it.
[00:15:31.644 --> 00:15:32.945]  And he just gave me a huh.
[00:15:33.885 --> 00:15:36.306]  So that's really what happened.
[00:15:36.846 --> 00:15:40.008]  You were walking down the hall he had already fired at that time?
[00:15:40.488 --> 00:15:41.088]  Yes, sir.
[00:15:41.168 --> 00:15:41.628]  With him.
[00:15:41.648 --> 00:15:43.269]  Weren't you scared?
[00:15:45.406 --> 00:15:51.212]  Um, in the moment I wasn't, because there was obviously, definitely another shooter involved.
[00:15:51.893 --> 00:15:54.675]  But... Oh, you think he was not the only one?
[00:15:55.096 --> 00:15:55.276]  No.
[00:15:56.057 --> 00:15:56.737]  Definitely not.
[00:15:57.438 --> 00:15:58.259]  Why do you say that?
[00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.400]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.641]  Stay with us with the rest.
[00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:21.772]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm not gonna speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:21.852 --> 00:16:24.895]  But immune wall is incredible at folks.
[00:16:25.095 --> 00:16:27.276]  Other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:28.137 --> 00:16:28.817]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:28.937 --> 00:16:32.100]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.700]  And so much more.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.401]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:35.641 --> 00:16:37.321]  You need to go read what is in here.

[00:16:43.163 --> 00:16:44.363]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:44.383 --> 00:16:46.304]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:48.784]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:48.984 --> 00:16:50.265]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:50.425 --> 00:16:52.245]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:52.785 --> 00:16:53.385]  Immune Wall.

[00:18:59.214 --> 00:19:02.800]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.261]  Go ahead.
[00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:05.705]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:05.725 --> 00:19:08.790]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.681]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:11.021 --> 00:19:12.742]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:13.443 --> 00:19:15.504]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:15.764 --> 00:19:19.747]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:19.767 --> 00:19:22.268]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:23.089 --> 00:19:25.410]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:26.871]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:28.012]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:28.252 --> 00:19:29.273]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:29.713 --> 00:19:30.754]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:31.855]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:32.716]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:32.996 --> 00:19:38.360]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.944]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:43.184 --> 00:19:46.046]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:46.307 --> 00:19:46.687]  You understand?
[00:19:46.787 --> 00:19:48.048]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:48.428 --> 00:19:49.549]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:55.436]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars!
[00:19:55.897 --> 00:19:56.858]  Do you understand?
[00:19:56.878 --> 00:19:58.100]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.022]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:20:05.409 --> 00:20:08.052]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:19.526 --> 00:20:24.508]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.230]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.391]  You know, I need to open the phones up.
[00:20:32.032 --> 00:20:46.719]  We have a news hotline as well for witnesses, people that were in the school, family members, you name it, because David Knight, right at the end of his broadcast that just ended, the Real News with David Knight, that just ended about 20 minutes ago, that comes on before mine, my broadcast here,
[00:20:48.433 --> 00:21:05.741]  Out of the studio right next door to me, had a caller who's giving us his information, his proof, and it looks very credible that he was in the high school, and that four weeks ago they had a SWAT team drill, and that he thought it was all very suspicious, and that then it appears this may have been part of a drill as well.
[00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:08.202]  We're not saying the police would be involved.
[00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:15.185]  Different criminal elements will bootleg false flags with drills to use that for confusion.
[00:21:15.987 --> 00:21:21.070]  And then classically, people will be wearing SWAT masks, balaclava, gas mask, you name it.
[00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:23.732]  And then people can insert themselves in a drill.
[00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:29.816]  Then it freaks the police out so bad that they then all get implicated, just like Columbine.
[00:21:30.196 --> 00:21:32.278]  It came out that they thought police had shot some of the students.
[00:21:32.498 --> 00:21:34.779]  No, it was other shooters, other reporters.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:44.606]  But they got the police department to go fully under their control by having it during a drill and implicating them and having the sheriff and police department stand down.
[00:21:45.086 --> 00:21:51.637]  All that came out and it was the prototype of how these deep state operations get pulled.
[00:21:53.208 --> 00:21:55.369]  And so I'm not saying this is a false flag yet.
[00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:01.934]  We have witnesses saying, you know, they're hearing shots going on in the halls and they're there talking to the guy.
[00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:05.736]  And there's definitely two shooters going on.
[00:22:06.637 --> 00:22:08.518]  That interview is up on Infowars.com.
[00:22:08.838 --> 00:22:13.381]  And then we've got this next student set to come on and join us exclusively coming up.
[00:22:13.421 --> 00:22:15.783]  This is a big deal, but we're vetting all that right now.
[00:22:16.883 --> 00:22:22.966]  So right now, let's go ahead and finish up with Alexa Meadnick, a senior there that knew the individual.
[00:22:23.006 --> 00:22:23.426]  Here it is.
[00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:25.487]  You were walking down the hall.
[00:22:25.547 --> 00:22:27.288]  He had already fired at that time.
[00:22:27.768 --> 00:22:28.388]  Yes, sir.
[00:22:28.428 --> 00:22:28.949]  With him.
[00:22:29.989 --> 00:22:30.709]  Weren't you scared?
[00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:39.433]  In the moment, I wasn't because there was obviously definitely another shooter involved.
[00:22:40.093 --> 00:22:41.954]  Oh, you think he was not the only one?
[00:22:42.374 --> 00:22:42.555]  No.
[00:22:43.335 --> 00:22:44.015]  Definitely not.
[00:22:44.716 --> 00:22:45.476]  Why do you say that?
[00:22:46.719 --> 00:22:51.764]  Um, because when shots were fired, I saw him after the fact.
[00:22:52.824 --> 00:22:56.548]  So, and the shots were coming from the other part of the building.
[00:22:57.188 --> 00:23:00.411]  So there definitely had to be two shooters involved, I believe.
[00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:02.493]  That's the first I've heard of that.
[00:23:02.713 --> 00:23:05.655]  Did you see any other students who were wounded?
[00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:07.317]  Um, no sir.
[00:23:09.511 --> 00:23:10.712]  My head is spinning right now.
[00:23:10.732 --> 00:23:16.856]  Let's just go to some excerpts of the President's statement that he made just about 45 minutes ago on this tragedy.
[00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:17.476]  Here it is.
[00:23:18.137 --> 00:23:24.701]  My fellow Americans, today I speak to a nation in grief.
[00:23:26.242 --> 00:23:38.371]  Yesterday, a school filled with innocent children and caring teachers became the scene of terrible violence, hatred,
[00:23:39.514 --> 00:23:39.994]  And evil.
[00:23:41.636 --> 00:23:53.725]  Around 2.30 yesterday afternoon, police responded to reports of gunfire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
[00:23:54.926 --> 00:23:56.907]  A great and safe community.
[00:23:58.308 --> 00:24:06.714]  There, a shooter, who is now in custody, opened fire on defensive students and teachers.
[00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:08.716]  He murdered
[00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:16.413]  17 people and badly wounded, at least 14 others.
[00:24:17.654 --> 00:24:24.937]  Our entire nation, with one heavy heart, is praying for the victims and their families.
[00:24:26.377 --> 00:24:39.022]  To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do.
[00:24:40.077 --> 00:24:41.099]  To ease your pain.
[00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:47.728]  We are all joined together as one American family.
[00:24:48.609 --> 00:24:52.454]  And your suffering is our burden also.
[00:24:53.866 --> 00:25:00.088]  No child, no teacher should ever be in danger in an American school.
[00:25:01.408 --> 00:25:08.851]  No parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning.
[00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:16.053]  Each person who was stolen from us yesterday had a full life ahead of them.
[00:25:17.213 --> 00:25:19.334]  A life filled with wondrous beauty
[00:25:21.033 --> 00:25:23.795]  And unlimited potential and promise.
[00:25:24.996 --> 00:25:30.841]  Each one had dreams to pursue, love to give, and talents to share with the world.
[00:25:32.162 --> 00:25:38.968]  And each one had a family to whom they meant everything in the world.
[00:25:40.409 --> 00:25:44.733]  Today, we mourn for all of those who lost their lives.
[00:25:46.174 --> 00:25:49.097]  We comfort the grieving and the wounded.
[00:25:50.956 --> 00:26:00.319]  And we heard for the entire community of Parkland, Florida, that is now in shock and pain and searching for answers.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:10.903]  To law enforcement, first responders, and teachers who responded so bravely in the face of danger, we thank you for your courage.
[00:26:12.463 --> 00:26:19.946]  Soon after the shooter, I spoke with Governor Scott to convey our deepest sympathies to the people
[00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:26.287]  Florida and our determination to assist in any way that we can.
[00:26:27.508 --> 00:26:36.034]  I also spoke with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.
[00:26:37.398 --> 00:26:47.030]  I'm making plans to visit Parkland, to meet with families and local officials, and to continue coordinating the federal response.
[00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:54.098]  In these moments of heartache and darkness, we hold onto God's word in scripture.
[00:26:55.099 --> 00:26:56.301]  I have heard your prayer.
[00:26:57.313 --> 00:26:57.794]  All right.
[00:26:57.814 --> 00:27:02.419]  We're going to come back with more of the president.
[00:27:02.439 --> 00:27:05.202]  We've got to go to break here in a moment.
[00:27:12.671 --> 00:27:26.705]  We do have a senior joining us, we've confirmed his identity, go ahead and use his name, who wants to talk about the fact that he and others are very very suspicious about the fact that they had a SWAT team mass shooting drill
[00:27:27.754 --> 00:27:32.717]  A month ago there, and then he then talked to some of the faculty about it and is going to reveal some of that exclusively here.
[00:27:33.337 --> 00:27:42.062]  He revealed it obviously with David Knight, but we've now confirmed he was a caller into the show, and have vetted him, and so that's going to be coming up.
[00:27:42.883 --> 00:27:53.529]  And again, let's be clear as I said earlier, it's on record that the FBI had been warned specifically about this individual, and we now have news articles buried that people that knew him said that his parents had recently died.
[00:27:54.522 --> 00:28:18.840]  Parents and that he was on psychotropic drugs, so of course we're not saying he wasn't involved We're not saying 100% there were multiple shooters, but credible witnesses are saying it and With all we've seen in Vegas and all we've seen With the Pulse nightclub where the man that did the shooting was an islamicist on the FBI payroll that did security
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:24.723]  Uh, and who had been an informant for the FBI, was part of an international mercenary organization.
[00:28:25.623 --> 00:28:28.365]  Uh, these things are done, a lot of these politically.
[00:28:29.526 --> 00:28:34.989]  And Nicholas Cruz, troubled suspect, had been expelled from Majority Stoneman Douglas High School.
[00:28:35.979 --> 00:28:38.742]  Again, that's about 40 miles north of Miami.
[00:28:39.042 --> 00:28:45.328]  I just mentioned Miami, so folks, you have an idea of right where it is in southeastern Florida.
[00:28:45.928 --> 00:28:54.156]  So, we're going to be breaking all this down straight ahead, but the big article is on Infowars.com, and there's several, several big articles.
[00:28:54.336 --> 00:28:56.018]  One deals with, are there going to be copycats?
[00:28:56.058 --> 00:28:57.179]  There almost always are.
[00:28:57.599 --> 00:28:58.720]  People should be packing.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.402]  The answer is to protect ourselves.
[00:29:01.701 --> 00:29:06.444]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[00:29:06.704 --> 00:29:12.228]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[00:29:12.348 --> 00:29:21.394]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[00:29:21.554 --> 00:29:29.379]  So go to FortifiedSupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.161]  That's FortifiedSupply.com.
[00:29:34.322 --> 00:29:39.103]  Now, joining us is a best-selling author and researcher, Michael Malice.
[00:29:40.024 --> 00:29:41.044]  MichaelMalice.com.
[00:29:41.084 --> 00:29:44.645]  He grew up behind the Iron Curtain, so he understands the tyranny of collectivism.
[00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:46.266]  He's at Twitter, at Michael Malice.
[00:29:46.346 --> 00:29:50.887]  He's written Dear Reader, Kim Jong-il, and he's been over there and researched it.
[00:29:50.927 --> 00:29:55.029]  So again, Michael Malice, author of The Dear Reader, about North Korea.
[00:29:55.629 --> 00:29:59.050]  Give us your expert take on where we are right now and the chances for war over there.
[00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:00.991]  I talk about this heavily in my book.
[00:30:01.111 --> 00:30:07.192]  If you look at these countries, Libya is a great example, Iraq, and several others.
[00:30:07.352 --> 00:30:12.674]  When the countries liberalize, Romania was the example Kim Jong Il himself used.
[00:30:13.074 --> 00:30:16.495]  When these countries liberalize, very often the people at the top are shot.
[00:30:17.035 --> 00:30:17.915]  And with good reason.
[00:30:17.955 --> 00:30:20.076]  You look at Gaddafi, he was sodomized to death.
[00:30:20.356 --> 00:30:21.637]  Saddam Hussein was hung.
[00:30:21.997 --> 00:30:24.818]  And Libya had a nascent nuclear program.
[00:30:25.178 --> 00:30:26.398]  They agreed to give it up.
[00:30:26.478 --> 00:30:28.639]  And what happened is, right now you have slavery there.
[00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:33.441]  So North Korea very quickly realizes the best defense is a good offense.
[00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:40.263]  Kim Jong Il said he wants to turn the country into a hedgehog, meaning one with nuclear missile spines pointing in every direction.
[00:30:40.723 --> 00:30:48.728]  And if you think about it, how much easier... I don't think they would have been running their mouths to this point if they didn't have nukes or at least some very, very strong weaponry.
[00:30:49.048 --> 00:30:50.209]  Something would have happened to him.
[00:30:50.309 --> 00:30:53.351]  So they are very conniving in their hold on power.
[00:30:53.671 --> 00:30:56.793]  They're very interested in self-preservation.
[00:30:57.113 --> 00:31:05.218]  And unfortunately, it's at the expense of the, you know, 25 million North Korean population who are the victims in this horrible decades-long atrocity.
[00:31:05.698 --> 00:31:15.385]  Don't they know the calculus has changed and that the whole strategy of patience and then the globalists using North Korea as a strategy of tension, that that is coming to an end?
[00:31:15.525 --> 00:31:17.647]  It is coming to an end and they're scared.
[00:31:17.787 --> 00:31:21.810]  And they're clearly scared and you see that they're reaching out to South Korea, their arch rival.
[00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:28.055]  In some kind of China very publicly last year and in the recent months has been turning their backs on them.
[00:31:28.376 --> 00:31:30.578]  Russia to some extent has been turning their backs on them.
[00:31:30.818 --> 00:31:39.406]  You know, Putin liked the idea that North Korea could kind of be a thorn in our side, but even he's not going to be defending, you know, concentration camps and starving children for political purposes.
[00:31:39.686 --> 00:31:41.007]  He's a far cry from Stalin.
[00:31:41.388 --> 00:31:44.871]  So North Korea has been an international embarrassment, especially
[00:31:45.231 --> 00:31:49.653]  For China, although they do serve a purpose, but China wants to have this dignified appearance.
[00:31:49.973 --> 00:31:50.614]  The Olympics!
[00:31:50.874 --> 00:31:56.016]  Is there any bigger symbol of global cooperation that, you know, that South Korea is having the Olympics now?
[00:31:56.356 --> 00:32:00.758]  This is, every country is turning their back on the North and they don't know what to do.
[00:32:00.818 --> 00:32:02.639]  This is kind of uncharted territory for them.
[00:32:02.939 --> 00:32:03.440]  Thank God.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:10.383]  And I'm not saying this is the end of the North Korean regime, which I pray every day that it is, but if this were the end, this is what the end would look like.
[00:32:10.663 --> 00:32:19.249]  They are a hostage nation of just people who don't even know what planet they're on, and that's why they're the greatest victims, people under communism.
[00:32:19.289 --> 00:32:22.731]  Michael Malice, the book Dear Reader, available everywhere on Twitter.
[00:32:22.771 --> 00:32:24.833]  Michael Malice, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:32:24.873 --> 00:32:25.533]  I appreciate you.
[00:32:26.153 --> 00:32:26.694]  Thank you, Alex.

[00:32:57.903 --> 00:33:00.484]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:05.009 --> 00:33:11.256]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:25.672]  Big Brother Mainstream Media Government Cover-Ups
[00:33:27.148 --> 00:33:28.069]  You want answers?
[00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:30.931]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:30.971 --> 00:33:37.275]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:44.499 --> 00:33:52.565]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have over-the-top bombshell news right now, less than 24 hours into the tragic
[00:33:53.447 --> 00:33:59.155]  Mass shooting in Florida at the high school there.
[00:34:00.577 --> 00:34:06.466]  We have eyewitness reports on video of seniors and students.
[00:34:07.432 --> 00:34:31.429]  Like Alexa Meadnick saying that she heard shots going off on the other side, down the hallway on the other side of the building, and then there was the reported shooter, Nicholas Cruz, that she knew, and she knew had been expelled the year before, and she said, boy, I'd expect you to be the person involved in the mass shooting, but she said it wasn't him, and that she could hear the shooting going off.
[00:34:31.549 --> 00:34:35.592]  I've already played that clip twice since the broadcast started 34 minutes ago.
[00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:40.259]  Then we've been contacted.
[00:34:40.279 --> 00:34:41.260]  We've seen his ID.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.300]  We've checked his social media.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.460]  He is who he says he is.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:46.541]  He's Jalen Martin.
[00:34:47.481 --> 00:34:48.281]  He is a senior.
[00:34:48.301 --> 00:34:50.722]  We can show you his YouTube channel.
[00:34:51.882 --> 00:34:58.124]  And Jalen Martin has reported to us that four weeks ago there was a secret service
[00:34:59.614 --> 00:35:02.356]  SWAT team drill at the school for some reason.
[00:35:03.096 --> 00:35:04.697]  He'd already asked why it was going on.
[00:35:05.477 --> 00:35:11.300]  And then he now has talked to the faculty and has some very interesting developments to go over.
[00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:12.821]  And I don't know, why is this so important?
[00:35:16.904 --> 00:35:20.566]  We're not saying the Secret Service, the local police, or anybody are involved in this.
[00:35:21.406 --> 00:35:22.607]  If there is a cover-up.
[00:35:23.327 --> 00:35:24.148]  Or multiple shooters.
[00:35:24.428 --> 00:35:26.449]  As witnesses are saying, credible witnesses.
[00:35:28.399 --> 00:35:41.927]  We're saying this because if they run drills, it's used by criminal groups who order the drill or who are able to use the drill as a cover for later operations.
[00:35:42.847 --> 00:35:47.269]  So many times false flags are accompanied by a drill before and generally on the day of.
[00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:56.595]  And Jalen Martin, a senior at Majority Stoneman Douglas High School, again just about 40 minutes north of Miami,
[00:35:57.813 --> 00:35:57.953]  He's
[00:36:15.796 --> 00:36:19.659]  We're now getting reports that other people said that there were shootings on both ends of the building going on.
[00:36:19.999 --> 00:36:36.629]  Now, just like Vegas, it turned out the top acoustics experts listened to the audio and there were multiple shooters and now they are looking into multiple shooters and they admit there's been some type of cover-up and there was this big Saudi Arabian military conference happening that weekend and Paddock was a gun runner and he had gone to the Middle East.
[00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.231]  We broke all that the day after.
[00:36:39.812 --> 00:36:41.853]  Just like we're covering all this the day after.
[00:36:43.413 --> 00:36:50.984]  So I'm just setting the table there that we don't just go into things and say, oh it's a false flag, oh it's fake.
[00:36:52.486 --> 00:36:56.171]  Sometimes stuff is exactly like they say and we are saying real people were shot.
[00:36:56.963 --> 00:36:59.925]  The media will, of course, say that I say no one shot.
[00:36:59.965 --> 00:37:02.527]  That's a hoax they always put out because they're fake news.
[00:37:02.547 --> 00:37:04.468]  They're also saying Trump blamed the victims.
[00:37:04.548 --> 00:37:06.670]  There's no such tweets, no such statements.
[00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.432]  CNN, MSNBC, they're all lying.
[00:37:10.592 --> 00:37:14.355]  So, joining us for this segment, the next, is Jalen Martin.
[00:37:14.375 --> 00:37:15.135]  We appreciate his courage.
[00:37:16.056 --> 00:37:19.619]  Reaching out to us as a listener and getting us a student ID and all his info.
[00:37:19.719 --> 00:37:21.920]  And so here he joins us, senior at the high school.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.783]  First I want to give him my condolences for any friends he may have lost or what happened.
[00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:42.314]  So you've got the floor of this segment and the next, and longer if you need it, to talk about what happened, your view, the Secret Service, the SWAT drill, what faculty told you, did you know or ever talk to Nicholas Cruz, the reported lone gunman.
[00:37:42.954 --> 00:37:43.575]  A.K.A.
[00:37:43.615 --> 00:37:44.715]  Tim McVeigh, A.K.A.
[00:37:44.735 --> 00:37:45.416]  Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:37:45.436 --> 00:37:46.076]  I mean, did you talk?
[00:37:47.137 --> 00:37:47.997]  Did you know this fellow?
[00:37:48.037 --> 00:37:49.178]  Thank you for joining us, Jalen.
[00:37:50.699 --> 00:37:51.200]  Yes, Alex.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:58.844]  So I'd like to start off with saying I don't know Nick, but I've possibly seen him around.
[00:37:59.745 --> 00:38:03.187]  You know, there's a lot of oddball people that you meet in high school.
[00:38:03.968 --> 00:38:08.811]  But I just want to jump into four weeks ago when the Secret Service stuff started happening.
[00:38:10.012 --> 00:38:13.153]  So, uh, it was sort of like a random thing.
[00:38:13.213 --> 00:38:16.154]  I think it happened, like, right after a weekend or something.
[00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:23.696]  The teachers, every single one of them was instructed to tell us, like, where our Zoom groups were for each class.
[00:38:24.356 --> 00:38:26.876]  And, uh, you know, every single day they would tell us.
[00:38:26.956 --> 00:38:29.757]  And then I talked to one of my teachers.
[00:38:30.837 --> 00:38:33.378]  In fact, it was the same teacher that I ended up being with.
[00:38:34.305 --> 00:38:43.369]  Um, you know, yesterday, when all of this went down, and he said that the Secret Service came and trained them on what the new safety protocols would be.
[00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:47.591]  And I don't understand why the Secret Service was, you know, the ones who were doing it.
[00:38:47.931 --> 00:38:52.813]  Because I would think that, you know, firefighters or police officers would be the ones to do this.
[00:38:54.154 --> 00:38:56.675]  And so, I kind of disregarded it.
[00:38:56.995 --> 00:38:58.276]  Fast forward to yesterday.
[00:38:59.918 --> 00:39:04.782]  Uh, we had a drill, because regularly we have to have drills now because of, you know, this protocol thing.
[00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:10.547]  Um, we had a drill in second period, you know, 8, 8-9 or something like, or 9.
[00:39:10.727 --> 00:39:13.549]  It was like 9 to 10 to 11 or something like that.
[00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:18.633]  And then, fast forward again to later in the day, we hear the fire alarm.
[00:39:19.474 --> 00:39:22.937]  Everyone was confused because we already had a fire drill today.
[00:39:23.798 --> 00:39:25.659]  Why was the fire alarm going off again?
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.641]  That's what everyone was, like, wondering.
[00:39:28.624 --> 00:39:30.225]  So we all just went outside.
[00:39:30.626 --> 00:39:32.107]  We stood there for like one minute.
[00:39:32.147 --> 00:39:34.349]  Within one minute, there were like four police cars there.
[00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:37.811]  My teacher was standing there because he didn't know what was happening.
[00:39:37.851 --> 00:39:38.272]  No one did.
[00:39:38.292 --> 00:39:40.113]  He thought it was a fire drill.
[00:39:41.174 --> 00:39:45.778]  And then eventually he was like, okay, let's go because everyone was shifting fast.
[00:39:45.818 --> 00:39:47.399]  And I mean, there's like 3,000 kids there.
[00:39:47.439 --> 00:39:49.481]  Everyone was shifting away from the school.
[00:39:50.439 --> 00:39:54.300]  So, within, like, the next three minutes, there had to have been, like, at least 50 cars there.
[00:39:54.741 --> 00:39:59.022]  I kept telling people around me, okay, this is not anything serious until I see a helicopter.
[00:39:59.822 --> 00:40:05.464]  And within, like, a few more minutes, I ended up seeing a helicopter, but I got reports from people around me.
[00:40:05.484 --> 00:40:08.806]  They were telling me, oh, this is a code black, which means bomb.
[00:40:09.266 --> 00:40:10.546]  That was the new thing that we learned.
[00:40:12.107 --> 00:40:13.787]  And then people were like, no, it's code red.
[00:40:13.827 --> 00:40:15.488]  It's code red, which means active shooter.
[00:40:15.968 --> 00:40:18.329]  So my friend took my phone from me
[00:40:19.255 --> 00:40:21.476]  And he used it to call his mom, because he didn't have his phone.
[00:40:21.496 --> 00:40:22.537]  He thought it was a fire drill.
[00:40:22.937 --> 00:40:24.498]  He was just going to leave it in the classroom.
[00:40:25.058 --> 00:40:26.219]  So he tried to call his mom.
[00:40:26.239 --> 00:40:27.140]  His mom answered.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.561]  And he was like, Mom, there's an active shooter here.
[00:40:29.581 --> 00:40:30.582]  There's an active shooter.
[00:40:30.882 --> 00:40:33.183]  A teacher came up out of nowhere and said, Don't tell her that!
[00:40:33.423 --> 00:40:33.824]  Be quiet!
[00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:34.624]  Don't tell anybody!
[00:40:35.264 --> 00:40:36.225]  And he was like, Shut up!
[00:40:36.505 --> 00:40:40.287]  So the teacher walked up, snatched the phone away from him, and it looked like he was going to break my phone.
[00:40:40.307 --> 00:40:41.328]  I was like, No, that's my phone.
[00:40:41.348 --> 00:40:42.289]  He was like, Don't give it back.
[00:40:42.689 --> 00:40:43.349]  Don't tell anyone.
[00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:44.390]  So...
[00:40:45.595 --> 00:40:48.657]  After that, me and him, like, sped up and tried to, like, go through the crowd.
[00:40:48.697 --> 00:40:52.458]  Like, I've never been so congested with people before.
[00:40:52.879 --> 00:41:00.822]  At one point, I tried to, like, turn around and walk back to the school because I wasn't sure what was happening, and I sort of, like, felt inside, like, there's something wrong.
[00:41:00.842 --> 00:41:01.903]  What can I do to stop this?
[00:41:02.503 --> 00:41:04.164]  I was being pushed forward and pushed forward.
[00:41:05.725 --> 00:41:14.669]  Excuse me, you're telling me that after it starts coming out that there's an active shooter code red, you're overhearing all this, 50 police cars, a helicopter, you were pushed back in the school?
[00:41:15.996 --> 00:41:16.616]  No, no, no.
[00:41:16.656 --> 00:41:17.897]  I was pushed away from the school.
[00:41:17.937 --> 00:41:20.159]  I was trying to go back because I wasn't sure what was happening.
[00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:24.482]  And, you know, other kids, there were like, you know, a thousand plus kids there.
[00:41:24.822 --> 00:41:28.044]  They were pushing me, pushing me farther away from the school so I didn't get to go back.
[00:41:28.484 --> 00:41:28.924]  Oh, I understand.
[00:41:28.944 --> 00:41:29.525]  Well, that makes sense.
[00:41:29.565 --> 00:41:30.405]  Okay, continue, please.
[00:41:31.166 --> 00:41:43.254]  And then, so then what happened was, um, I, I let my friend, you know, use my phone and we tried to get away from the teacher and he called his mom back and he was like, Mom, there's an active shooter, there's an active shooter.
[00:41:43.654 --> 00:41:45.275]  And a second helicopter showed up.
[00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.371]  At that point, everyone started running.
[00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:49.812]  People were tripping.
[00:41:50.412 --> 00:41:52.093]  People were just trying to run away.
[00:41:52.894 --> 00:42:09.582]  I didn't hear the gunshots, really, but I got told by someone that I talked to a little bit later that there had to have been two people because he was like, I was in a building close to it, but I wasn't in the building that the shooter was in.
[00:42:09.942 --> 00:42:12.003]  That building that the shooter was in has three floors.
[00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:15.265]  So, you know, there's been reports that he had a gas mask.
[00:42:16.138 --> 00:42:19.099]  The smoke bombs down and people heard explosions.
[00:42:19.159 --> 00:42:20.439]  That's what first took people off.
[00:42:20.459 --> 00:42:23.540]  They like sort of were confused because there was a fire alarm.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:33.001]  And at that point it's just like people sort of got chaotic once they like sort of kind of like knew what was happening.
[00:42:33.442 --> 00:42:36.122]  No one knew for sure because the teachers wouldn't let us call.
[00:42:37.442 --> 00:42:40.243]  I was like trying like really hard to get away from that one teacher.
[00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:51.349]  Um, but people got out of there, and then I talked to my teacher, um, last night, afterwards, and I, uh, I asked him, I was like, you said there were Secret Service agents here.
[00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:54.152]  Jalen, Jalen, oh, oh my gosh, stay right there, we gotta go on a break.
[00:42:54.192 --> 00:42:57.355]  Jalen Martin, we're gonna come right back and repeat what you just said.
[00:42:57.375 --> 00:43:00.699]  Uh, what I think you just, what I just think you just said, wow.
[00:43:51.643 --> 00:43:54.326]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[00:43:54.366 --> 00:44:01.273]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[00:44:01.334 --> 00:44:02.935]  These signals being sent through time
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.582]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:44:18.162 --> 00:44:21.305]  Our signal has reached more than 2 billion people.
[00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:27.390]  But the enemy is now aware of the fact that we've broken through and are moving to block us on every front.
[00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:36.858]  The only way you're going to be able to see our videos and articles is to visit InfoWars.com itself and hand-share the videos and articles to everyone you know.
[00:44:37.438 --> 00:44:42.723]  The signal is getting through and is exposing and defeating the globalists when we're able to get it through.
[00:44:43.283 --> 00:44:48.605]  But they're admittedly expanding their operations to suppress us, so only you can boost the signal.
[00:44:49.206 --> 00:44:51.246]  Only you can defeat the globalists.
[00:44:51.507 --> 00:44:52.467]  We're in this together.
[00:44:52.907 --> 00:44:56.489]  I salute you for your work, and I ask all of you to redouble your efforts.
[00:44:56.589 --> 00:45:01.291]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are resistance.
[00:45:01.871 --> 00:45:10.695]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with a muon wall.
[00:45:11.926 --> 00:45:13.728]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[00:45:13.788 --> 00:45:20.915]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[00:45:21.316 --> 00:45:27.122]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[00:45:27.782 --> 00:45:29.123]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[00:45:29.724 --> 00:45:48.778]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[00:45:49.859 --> 00:45:53.982]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[00:45:54.302 --> 00:45:59.565]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[00:45:59.985 --> 00:46:01.026]  As above, so below.
[00:46:01.586 --> 00:46:04.408]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[00:46:05.308 --> 00:46:06.389]  Most tiny of scales.
[00:46:06.909 --> 00:46:07.950]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:09.911]  America is building its wall.
[00:46:10.312 --> 00:46:10.772]  Will it work?
[00:46:10.912 --> 00:46:11.392]  We don't know.
[00:46:11.893 --> 00:46:12.493]  Is Trump right?
[00:46:13.174 --> 00:46:15.335]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[00:46:15.795 --> 00:46:19.398]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work.
[00:46:19.818 --> 00:46:21.779]  And without this wall, we would all die.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.803]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family.
[00:46:26.823 --> 00:46:28.044]  And I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[00:46:28.764 --> 00:46:35.067]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[00:46:35.827 --> 00:46:39.089]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:50.834]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[00:46:51.494 --> 00:46:53.857]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[00:46:54.518 --> 00:46:57.762]  You will get a mean wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:58.102 --> 00:47:01.807]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[00:47:05.992 --> 00:47:08.615]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:23.399 --> 00:47:28.129]  Ladies and gentlemen, my head is on fire right now with this.
[00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:32.918]  We've got KPRC with witnesses of multiple shooters now.
[00:47:34.455 --> 00:47:35.936]  I knew I'd seen it in newspapers.
[00:47:36.256 --> 00:47:46.380]  Now we have KHOU, we have KPRC, a lot of Texas stations there because they were having baseball tryouts for some of the Texas teams there.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:52.422]  And so a lot of Texas TV stations there talking to eyewitnesses are like, yeah, there's shots going off of here, over there.
[00:47:52.482 --> 00:47:54.703]  I saw the shooter while shooting was going on.
[00:47:55.703 --> 00:47:56.623]  She didn't have a gun.
[00:47:56.643 --> 00:47:58.384]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:47:59.284 --> 00:48:00.225]  And I was just talking.
[00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:04.672]  To Jalen Martin, who is a senior there.
[00:48:04.712 --> 00:48:05.853]  We've got a student ID.
[00:48:05.873 --> 00:48:08.174]  He's got a YouTube channel, Jalen Martin.
[00:48:08.835 --> 00:48:13.878]  He's just uploaded some videos now dealing with talking to some of the locals.
[00:48:15.238 --> 00:48:18.621]  So he's gonna be uploading more videos today.
[00:48:18.641 --> 00:48:20.161]  So who knows?
[00:48:20.182 --> 00:48:21.622]  Maybe he'll become a reporter for InfoWars.
[00:48:21.642 --> 00:48:24.784]  But Jalen Martin, laying on us, recapping what you said.
[00:48:24.804 --> 00:48:27.266]  You talked to friends that said they thought there were multiple shooters.
[00:48:28.166 --> 00:48:29.047]  The Secret Service had a
[00:48:29.107 --> 00:48:29.507]  I think so.
[00:48:52.556 --> 00:48:55.898]  Cut out like Sirhan Sirhan, and people know about what happened with the RFK.
[00:48:56.198 --> 00:49:00.360]  That was totally, the local coroner said that he was shot from behind, not from in front.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.722]  Sirhan Sirhan's arm was wedged on the table in the kitchen.
[00:49:04.022 --> 00:49:05.823]  He did not shoot Robert F. Kennedy.
[00:49:06.463 --> 00:49:07.644]  So that's a little bit of background.
[00:49:07.664 --> 00:49:09.525]  This is really getting bad, folks.
[00:49:09.545 --> 00:49:11.126]  This looks just like Vegas.
[00:49:11.786 --> 00:49:19.330]  So just recapping everything and the points you haven't made here, Jalen, because this is, and we've got new video on top of the other videos we're going to play as well of more eyewitnesses.
[00:49:21.471 --> 00:49:32.118]  Yeah, I talked to a guy who had a class with him, and he said he was just really weird.
[00:49:32.158 --> 00:49:34.940]  He did everything that people told him to do.
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:41.904]  It was like he just wanted friends, but it was more like a like there was obviously mental issues with this guy.
[00:49:42.525 --> 00:49:49.189]  And it was like when he told me that I kind of like thought to myself, OK, this is that
[00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.251]  Makes sense in a way, you know?
[00:49:53.132 --> 00:50:04.140]  And it's like, when people are compliant like that, to that degree that he specified, there's so many things that they could do just from someone telling them to do it.
[00:50:05.882 --> 00:50:11.346]  We still don't know exactly why he did this, at least they haven't released why he did this, but
[00:50:13.234 --> 00:50:17.159]  I feel like whatever he says is not probably going to sound exactly right.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:24.509]  So they're going to try to cut around the story and make it sound, okay, he did this because someone didn't like him here and there.
[00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:27.713]  But he obviously had anger issues as well.
[00:50:28.734 --> 00:50:30.016]  I talked to another friend who has
[00:50:31.255 --> 00:50:31.495]  That's
[00:50:51.579 --> 00:50:52.320]  Try to call.
[00:50:52.621 --> 00:50:53.382]  She didn't answer.
[00:50:53.402 --> 00:50:55.585]  And then he got her cell phone number.
[00:50:55.645 --> 00:50:57.648]  I don't know how this guy got her cell phone number.
[00:50:57.688 --> 00:50:59.050]  He doesn't talk to anybody out here.
[00:50:59.471 --> 00:51:00.292]  Not really, at least.
[00:51:02.518 --> 00:51:05.800]  In the context of that, I think there was something weird going on.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.423]  He ran up to her the next time he saw her and put in her face, like, F-U-B.
[00:51:10.563 --> 00:51:13.705]  I'm sorry, I know this is a family show.
[00:51:13.745 --> 00:51:14.886]  No, no, it's okay.
[00:51:14.906 --> 00:51:22.691]  So, very, some of the classic type that is shuttered, very insecure, somewhat autistic.
[00:51:23.531 --> 00:51:32.933]  Uh, and then doesn't understand normal human behavior, like you should invite her out to the movies or a restaurant or to get coffee or, you know, the comic book store or whatever, uh, or, you know, go for a jog.
[00:51:33.293 --> 00:51:35.474]  Instead, when she doesn't answer right away, he flips out.
[00:51:35.934 --> 00:51:46.076]  Uh, so, so, uh, it sounds like a video game TV head that never made real relationships, uh, and, you know, very nihilistic from what we heard and all sorts of stuff on the internet, left, right, and center.
[00:51:46.096 --> 00:51:48.337]  Uh, I mean, that's the MO we're getting.
[00:51:49.197 --> 00:51:50.839]  And so it could have been him as the shooter.
[00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:51.779]  I'm just zeroing in.
[00:51:51.799 --> 00:52:04.369]  Have you seen the video of a senior there at the high school, Alexa Mednick, who says that she knew him and talked to him and there he was as shots are going off and she thinks there were multiple shooters?
[00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:06.831]  Yes.
[00:52:07.271 --> 00:52:13.676]  One more little interesting thing about that is he, you know, he dropped the gun and blended in with all the crowd and then left.
[00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:17.411]  If I had walked home, I just went to Starbucks, because it's right there.
[00:52:17.811 --> 00:52:19.012]  And I waited for my mom to pick me up.
[00:52:19.072 --> 00:52:21.494]  And if I had walked home, I would have been walking beside him.
[00:52:21.954 --> 00:52:24.496]  Because he was caught, literally, on my street.
[00:52:26.237 --> 00:52:29.840]  And that's the thing about that is, they were pillaging through, you know, the school.
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:36.524]  And I heard... I heard that there were still shots, after like, 30 minutes or so.
[00:52:36.544 --> 00:52:37.965]  I heard there were still shots.
[00:52:38.045 --> 00:52:40.387]  I don't know if that was the police officers, or what.
[00:52:41.187 --> 00:52:42.208]  But that's what I heard.
[00:52:42.428 --> 00:52:43.049]  And if that is...
[00:52:43.954 --> 00:53:02.909]  Sure, so you're saying the official story doesn't add up, and over and over and over again, we now know, you said you've been a listener a few years, we're talking during the break, I mean, Vegas now, they admit the official story's not true, and the guy was a gun runner.
[00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:06.953]  Well, we first got that from FBI sources the day after he'd gone to the Middle East.
[00:53:07.013 --> 00:53:12.177]  I mean, we're not saying we know exactly what happened, we're just saying we've been lied to, and credible sources are telling us that.
[00:53:12.617 --> 00:53:22.064]  What does your gut tell you is going on here, Jalen Martin, again, there at the high school, the majority, Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida?
[00:53:24.226 --> 00:53:34.954]  Well, I think my gut is screaming to me right now, look, look, look for whatever is happening, because what's happening, at least what they say is happening, isn't really all of it.
[00:53:35.474 --> 00:53:39.237]  I think that the Secret Service had some indication weeks ago
[00:53:40.006 --> 00:53:47.167]  That something like this was going to happen, so they decided, okay, we need to make up an escape plan for all these kids and stuff like that, just in case.
[00:53:47.207 --> 00:53:52.388]  But they didn't tell... I don't think they told the teachers either, because my teacher would have gave me some indication as to why.
[00:53:52.408 --> 00:53:56.389]  Because I asked him, you know, why are they doing all this?
[00:53:56.429 --> 00:53:57.509]  Why is this Secret Service here?
[00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:58.329]  He was like, I don't know.
[00:53:58.789 --> 00:54:02.190]  And I asked him last night, do they have some indication that something might happen?
[00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:04.350]  He said they didn't explicitly say anything.
[00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.111]  So, I don't think the teachers knew.
[00:54:07.431 --> 00:54:08.111]  My teacher would have...
[00:54:08.849 --> 00:54:19.518]  At least hinted at it if he was told not to say anything, but this is like, you know, this is like something you really don't expect to happen at your school.
[00:54:21.027 --> 00:54:43.395]  Jalen, in your own words, because you got cut off by the last break, you were getting into your friends coming out, people that knew him as well, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, repeat what you were trying to finish when you talked about people that you talked to seeing multiple shooters as well, as we have a lot of witnesses coming forward, more video clips coming up in the next segment of You'll Ride Shotgun with us in a few more minutes, but just briefly, what specifically did your friends and classmates say they thought?
[00:54:45.157 --> 00:54:50.807]  Okay, so they said that after the school was clear and everyone was, you know, mostly gone,
[00:54:52.862 --> 00:55:00.928]  I think one of the people I talked to said they talked to, I can't remember her name, but you know the girl who was in that video who was like throwing multiple shooters?
[00:55:01.528 --> 00:55:03.229]  She said that she was with her, I think?
[00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:13.737]  And the weird thing about that is, if she was with her and then she heard the shots too, this is two people in the same place who heard these shots that obviously she couldn't have done.
[00:55:14.237 --> 00:55:15.078]  So I think there's...
[00:55:15.798 --> 00:55:22.642]  All right, Jalen, Jalen, I know school's off today, but I know you're busy, and you've gotten in a windy spot while you're walking around outside, so let me put you on hold if you can do five more minutes.
[00:55:22.662 --> 00:55:26.604]  I want to come back, try to get you in a spot where it's audible, then we're going to come right back to you.
[00:55:26.624 --> 00:55:30.406]  We appreciate your courage, but I want to get this clear, because I'm having trouble getting the last part.
[00:55:30.446 --> 00:55:41.533]  You're crystal clear, more articulate than I am, and most of my other crew around here, when your phone's clear, it's the phone that is being inarticulate here, so we're going to try to get to a spot where the wind is not blowing in the receiver.
[00:55:42.653 --> 00:55:44.335]  I haven't even, I'm going to get to it next hour.
[00:55:44.355 --> 00:55:46.696]  We're going to put this out on the web from the live show.
[00:55:46.716 --> 00:55:49.799]  We'll put the clips on the front and the back of more people coming forward.
[00:55:50.359 --> 00:55:54.002]  KPRC, KHOU saying, oh yeah, multiple shooters.
[00:55:54.803 --> 00:55:55.203]  You name it.
[00:55:55.263 --> 00:55:57.545]  That's all, that's all coming up when we come back.
[00:55:58.105 --> 00:55:59.766]  I've got to plug though, we're not going to be here.
[00:56:00.087 --> 00:56:01.207]  The crew keeps pointing that out to me.
[00:56:02.308 --> 00:56:07.051]  We've got 50% off all of the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[00:56:07.752 --> 00:56:16.198]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we have 50% off the Super High-Quality Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[00:56:16.778 --> 00:56:26.024]  And it's fortified with colloidal silver, it's fortified with high-quality iodine, and we use one of the top firms in the country that produces some of the top lines of organic toothpaste.
[00:56:26.444 --> 00:56:29.647]  But I can tell you right now that some of the top lines of organic toothpaste have about
[00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:32.488]  50 cents to a dollar worth of product in them.
[00:56:33.108 --> 00:56:39.910]  We put up to $3, depending on the run, because stuff costs different each run, $2 to $3 in each tube.
[00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:43.231]  And then when we sell it for $11, $12, that's a good deal.
[00:56:43.612 --> 00:56:48.093]  At $7.47, at 50% off right now, it's basically a loss leader for us.
[00:56:48.113 --> 00:56:49.514]  But I want you to see how great it is.
[00:56:50.054 --> 00:56:53.015]  And your purchase does help the broadcast, so the Super Blue
[00:56:53.675 --> 00:56:54.056]  I don't
[00:57:08.797 --> 00:57:12.981]  And that way you get it in your mail every 15, 30, 42, 60, or 90 days.
[00:57:13.361 --> 00:57:20.867]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:20.887 --> 00:57:24.531]  And a bunch of other big specials are about to end as well.
[00:57:24.551 --> 00:57:32.057]  50% off on the liver and kidney cleanse Icarin, super high powered, super high quality, only $19.95, and 50% off.
[00:57:32.077 --> 00:57:33.338]  That's our latest product.
[00:57:33.358 --> 00:57:34.299]  I want you to see how great it is.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:35.941]  53% off.
[00:57:35.981 --> 00:57:38.464]  That's going to be called DNA Force Plus very soon.
[00:57:38.945 --> 00:57:39.886]  And a bunch of other products.
[00:57:39.906 --> 00:57:42.410]  Those discounts are going to have to end early next week.
[00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:48.599]  So take advantage of that and fund a cutting-edge organization that will cover the news the globals don't want you to be aware of.
[00:57:51.963 --> 00:57:54.825]  Trace in New Jersey wants to talk about vaccines.
[00:57:54.845 --> 00:57:55.425]  Go ahead, Trace.
[00:57:55.925 --> 00:58:01.028]  First off, I wanted to start off with saying I've been waiting hours to talk to you, my man.
[00:58:01.068 --> 00:58:02.629]  You're one of my most favorite hosts.
[00:58:03.529 --> 00:58:10.633]  Second, I'd like to say Super Blue, Survival Shield, the Skel-Flu Defense Pack,
[00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:21.216]  They're all amazing, and I just ordered them all again, along with the Organic Urban Garden Seed Kit at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:21.317 --> 00:58:27.741]  But back to my point, in the early 1990s, ADHD was on the rise.
[00:58:28.601 --> 00:58:32.364]  My parents, they didn't believe that vaccines could ever hurt anybody.
[00:58:32.944 --> 00:58:35.146]  Yet, I found out, yes, I do have ADHD.
[00:58:36.347 --> 00:58:39.809]  I've been taking BrainForce now for about almost two years.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:44.101]  And with brain force, I'm able to focus perfectly.
[00:58:45.261 --> 00:58:52.383]  And my parents said that before the age of seven, I was not as hyperactive.
[00:58:52.743 --> 00:59:04.647]  And that's what got me, you know, PQ, wondering, hey, maybe, maybe it was something in a vaccine that could have triggered this change in me that made me so hyperactive.
[00:59:05.467 --> 00:59:05.927]  What is it?
[00:59:07.046 --> 00:59:11.348]  I do think that we're seeing a lot of these behavior disabilities.
[00:59:11.708 --> 00:59:17.071]  For one, we're cramming kids into a classroom for eight hours a day and expecting them to sit and shut up and not talk.
[00:59:17.972 --> 00:59:20.333]  And put their hands on their lap.
[00:59:21.033 --> 00:59:22.214]  So I think that's part of the problem.
[00:59:22.514 --> 00:59:26.436]  And then I think the other part of the problem is we're also injecting them with vaccines.
[00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:31.578]  It's probably having an increased incidence of developmental disabilities.
[00:59:31.618 --> 00:59:32.619]  What's your take on that, Lloyd?
[00:59:32.839 --> 00:59:46.729]  I wanna, you know, say to Trace, I think it's really great that he's asking questions and he's, you know, he's looking at things like brain force and he's thinking about, you know, things that he can do to take control of his own health.
[00:59:55.535 --> 00:59:59.438]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:14.045 --> 01:00:15.645]  You found it.
[01:00:15.665 --> 01:00:18.126]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[01:00:18.266 --> 01:00:20.007]  It's the Infowar.
[01:00:20.327 --> 01:00:22.827]  And now, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.667 --> 01:00:27.148]  Jalen Martin is a student at the high school.
[01:00:27.168 --> 01:00:29.769]  We've confirmed his student ID, who he is, his social media.
[01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:33.250]  And he's telling us that friends of his said they thought there were multiple shooters.
[01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:37.111]  There have been weird secret service SWAT team style drills going on.
[01:00:38.452 --> 01:00:41.094]  A lot of bizarre stuff if you just joined us.
[01:00:41.615 --> 01:00:49.842]  But now we've got more clips, not just Alexa Mednick saying that she saw the reported shooter walking along without guns and said, oh good, it's not you.
[01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:51.583]  We thought it'd be somebody like you.
[01:00:52.564 --> 01:00:55.787]  And then of course, other shots going off while that's happening.
[01:00:55.827 --> 01:00:59.711]  But we have another witness who's unnamed, who was on KPRC.
[01:01:00.411 --> 01:01:03.734]  Hispanic youth, we'll find her name, saying the same thing.
[01:01:03.754 --> 01:01:04.415]  Here's a clip of that.
[01:01:05.316 --> 01:01:05.896]  We're good to go.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:47.804]  Full clips coming up next segment after our guest leaves us, but did you hear multiple people shooting up at him?
[01:01:48.465 --> 01:01:52.687]  And that's what the witnesses are saying and they're so clear, but notice I said that was KPRC.
[01:01:52.787 --> 01:01:53.208]  It wasn't.
[01:01:53.628 --> 01:01:56.290]  That's somebody over the shoulder of KPRC on an iPhone.
[01:01:57.370 --> 01:01:59.592]  So the news isn't putting this out.
[01:02:01.428 --> 01:02:06.120]  We know that KHOU got it, thought it would be on the news, and it didn't.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:09.468]  So the reporter, Matt Muzzell, put it out on his Twitter.
[01:02:09.729 --> 01:02:10.410]  Here's a clip of that.
[01:02:11.977 --> 01:02:13.037]  They're all in shock.
[01:02:13.078 --> 01:02:14.098]  Let me just tell you this.
[01:02:14.138 --> 01:02:17.219]  We just spoke with a former student, Alexa Medick.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:24.643]  She actually walked down the hall with the accused shooter, Nicholas Cruz, after she heard shots fired.
[01:02:25.063 --> 01:02:28.024]  She said, hey, Nicholas, this is what she told me on camera.
[01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.525]  We will have it for a 10 o'clock show.
[01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.886]  She said, hey, I just heard shots fired.
[01:02:31.906 --> 01:02:33.067]  I'm surprised it wasn't you.
[01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:34.347]  Just kidding like that.
[01:02:34.367 --> 01:02:35.688]  He had this reaction.
[01:02:35.748 --> 01:02:35.988]  What?
[01:02:36.428 --> 01:02:37.969]  And then they parted ways.
[01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:39.951]  She said, I heard more shots after that.
[01:02:40.451 --> 01:02:42.112]  She thinks there was a second shooter.
[01:02:42.352 --> 01:02:45.755]  That's the first we've heard of that, but she believes there was actually a second shooter.
[01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:49.896]  And then that didn't air that night, but he had to put it on his Twitter, and we played that clip already, Alexa.
[01:02:50.176 --> 01:02:51.516]  Man, it will play, come on to the next segment.
[01:02:51.956 --> 01:02:56.017]  So, Jalen Martin, like you said, look, look, look, investigate, investigate, investigate.
[01:02:56.337 --> 01:02:57.617]  That's what your gut's telling you.
[01:02:58.697 --> 01:03:01.218]  But off air, you were just basically saying, yeah, this doesn't add up.
[01:03:01.238 --> 01:03:02.138]  You're going to investigate.
[01:03:02.158 --> 01:03:05.079]  You were saying, most of the other young adults, that they're not buying into it.
[01:03:05.499 --> 01:03:10.040]  Recapping what your friends told you about thinking there were multiple shooters, like you just heard from that young lady.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:11.500]  Did you recognize her voice?
[01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:20.665]  It's really hard to tell exactly who I was talking to, or who I was listening to, I'm sorry.
[01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:33.594]  But in terms of what my friends were telling me, I had a friend who I think she said she was walking with the girl in the previous video, who said there were multiple shooters.
[01:03:35.215 --> 01:03:38.498]  She basically was saying she was walking with her, and...
[01:03:41.923 --> 01:03:48.846]  It was impossible for there to have possibly been only one shooter because she heard shots still while they were all walking.
[01:03:49.506 --> 01:03:51.307]  And, you know, Nick was right there.
[01:03:52.307 --> 01:03:56.228]  So, the whole thing just doesn't add up to me.
[01:03:56.248 --> 01:04:02.391]  Uh, that and the fact that the Secret Service decided to come and change the safety protocol a few weeks ahead.
[01:04:02.651 --> 01:04:04.692]  I think that's pretty suspicious.
[01:04:04.832 --> 01:04:08.113]  And, uh, one thing that I also want to say is
[01:04:08.934 --> 01:04:12.658]  Like the girl in this video just said that there's only two exits.
[01:04:12.758 --> 01:04:13.999]  There's only two entrances.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:20.105]  And those stairwells, they have cameras in them.
[01:04:21.626 --> 01:04:22.988]  They clearly should have saw them.
[01:04:23.428 --> 01:04:27.873]  If they don't have someone operating those cameras at all times, they don't need the cameras really in the first place.
[01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:31.156]  Because they're like 3D cameras.
[01:04:31.818 --> 01:04:34.620]  In each stairwell, there's two stairwells, so that's like six.
[01:04:35.161 --> 01:04:40.425]  Then within each hallway on each floor, there are like two cameras.
[01:04:40.485 --> 01:04:42.467]  So, this is something they should have saw.
[01:04:43.467 --> 01:04:48.472]  I mean, they should have known, okay, this is this kid, and okay, I see him running up the stairs.
[01:04:48.492 --> 01:04:49.372]  Jalen Martin, stay there.
[01:04:49.412 --> 01:04:51.634]  We're back in 60 seconds, because you know the school.
[01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:59.420]  You're saying exactly what this other young lady was telling local TV and national TV, that they didn't decide to air, but a citizen shot video of the interview.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.001]  Thank God.
[01:05:00.101 --> 01:05:01.162]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:09.146]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:12.108]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:05:12.729 --> 01:05:16.152]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:05:16.432 --> 01:05:20.696]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:05:21.136 --> 01:05:24.379]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:35.450]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.

[01:05:59.806 --> 01:06:08.009]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:06:15.942 --> 01:06:17.765]  And the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:19.107 --> 01:06:21.330]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:06:25.497 --> 01:06:28.161]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:33.937 --> 01:06:40.461]  Listeners and viewers, everybody watching right now has to call their neighbors, their friends, their family.
[01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:43.763]  You've got to get the articles off Infowars.com.
[01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:53.728]  You've got to get them out to all the local media, particularly in Florida, and just demand that citizen journalists get down there on the ground.
[01:06:54.229 --> 01:06:56.150]  We should send reporters as well because
[01:06:58.186 --> 01:07:06.513]  We have Jalen Martin, a senior at Majority Stoneman Douglas High School, about 40 minutes north of Miami, Florida.
[01:07:07.334 --> 01:07:10.657]  You have 17 dead, more than 20 others seriously wounded.
[01:07:11.537 --> 01:07:24.268]  You've got what looks like a autistic young man who was highly suggestible, would do whatever he was told, could hardly even talk, would blow up at people for no reason, with his folks dead.
[01:07:25.345 --> 01:07:44.433]  Friends saying he was on psychotropic drugs working at the local Dollar Store, Dollar Tree Store, and that they had both exits covered and were shooting everybody trying to get out as they went up and the teachers would open the doors and they would be shot.
[01:07:46.499 --> 01:07:50.883]  That is serious intel, and it's not KPRC reporting it.
[01:07:51.363 --> 01:08:10.519]  It's a person with a cell phone recording what the local news is all being told, and only KHOU11 talking to a whole nother young woman, Alexa Mednik, saying the exact same thing, and she knew him, and said, there's shots going off down the hall, on the other side, and there he is.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.582]  Doesn't have a weapon, because she says, oh, it wasn't him.
[01:08:15.509 --> 01:08:16.290]  Shots are going off.
[01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.451]  She says, oh, I thought it would be somebody like you.
[01:08:19.331 --> 01:08:24.535]  And then local KHOU reporter live says, coming up, I'm going to have this for you on the news.
[01:08:24.555 --> 01:08:25.215]  I got the interview.
[01:08:25.455 --> 01:08:26.396]  And then they don't put it out.
[01:08:26.596 --> 01:08:27.677]  He puts it out on his Twitter.
[01:08:28.541 --> 01:08:31.122]  And I was saying earlier, it looks like they didn't want people to see that.
[01:08:31.162 --> 01:08:31.762]  They got told.
[01:08:32.042 --> 01:08:48.366]  Well, now we've got KPRC with a Hispanic high school student who's laying it all out, exactly what happened, about how they're pinned down from both ends, being pushed up into the building and being killed, waiting for the police to get there.
[01:08:50.446 --> 01:08:51.687]  Unbelievable.
[01:08:53.382 --> 01:08:59.325]  You think, you look at this young girl, we don't know her name because the news wouldn't air the interview, a citizen caught part of it.
[01:09:00.405 --> 01:09:07.029]  She looks absolutely 100% credible, telling you exactly what happened in a first hand energy.
[01:09:07.629 --> 01:09:10.850]  Just like Alexa Mednick is as well.
[01:09:11.411 --> 01:09:22.576]  And then we've got Jalen Martin being told this by other people that were there watching Alexa Mednick talk to the reported soul shooter.
[01:09:24.818 --> 01:09:35.783]  Nick Cruz, this is stinking to high heaven because the Orlando nightclub shooter was an FBI informant and part of a multinational security force.
[01:09:36.974 --> 01:09:56.668]  And there have been reports he was planning something and nothing was done, and then his dad was involved in all this weirdness and all this other weird crap, and showed up at Hillary speeches, and then was connected into all these other groups, and then you've got the same thing with Paddock, and our hostage rescue team sources saying he went to the Middle East, he's a gun runner, and then all that comes out months after we tell you exclusively?
[01:09:58.544 --> 01:10:00.865]  The media will say, Jones says no shooting happened.
[01:10:01.006 --> 01:10:02.807]  I am not saying that a shooting did happen.
[01:10:03.387 --> 01:10:07.770]  I'm saying the eyewitnesses, they don't want you to hear, are on air right now.
[01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:10.531]  So we're going back for final statements from Jalen Martin.
[01:10:10.551 --> 01:10:14.974]  He can call in, we've got his number, set up a producer's line with any breaking news today, tomorrow, next week.
[01:10:15.615 --> 01:10:17.136]  We really appreciate him helping us.
[01:10:17.396 --> 01:10:20.838]  We've confirmed his identity, have his student ID, all of it.
[01:10:22.042 --> 01:10:22.922]  Let's play this clip.
[01:10:22.942 --> 01:10:25.023]  I'm going to play the whole thing coming up, just a couple minutes long.
[01:10:25.404 --> 01:10:26.924]  This is what KPRC wouldn't air.
[01:10:27.024 --> 01:10:39.350]  It's over the shoulder of KPRC while they're talking to one of the survivors who saw, talk about riveting footage, a riveting interview, our teacher shot in the head as they're trapped by wolves coming in in a pincer attack.
[01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:40.431]  Multiple shooters.
[01:10:40.471 --> 01:10:40.871]  Here it is.
[01:10:41.932 --> 01:10:43.994]  We got all the kids to go outside so they could start shooting up.
[01:10:44.314 --> 01:10:48.058]  So they shot, they started shooting from the first floor up.
[01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:54.204]  Because there's only two exits in the freshman building so everybody started running to the other exit so that's when the shooter, the other shooter started coming up.
[01:10:54.724 --> 01:10:58.968]  So everybody, and then I thank God to this teacher who opened up her door and let all of us in.
[01:10:59.209 --> 01:11:01.331]  She got shot in the arm trying to open the door.
[01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:05.995]  And then the other teacher, he got shot in the head trying to cut the other students.
[01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:10.438]  This is all coming together now with sickening detail.
[01:11:10.478 --> 01:11:14.701]  And I keep saying majority because I'm going from memory.
[01:11:14.782 --> 01:11:16.683]  It's Marjory Stoneman, Douglas High School.
[01:11:35.287 --> 01:11:37.408]  Ladies and gentlemen, what have I been saying for months?
[01:11:37.888 --> 01:11:45.671]  The left keeps saying, if you release the memo exposing FBI corruption and Justice Department corruption, there'll be massacres.
[01:11:47.251 --> 01:11:49.852]  And I've said, all they've got left is a false flag card.
[01:11:49.892 --> 01:11:50.913]  Let's get Matt Bracken on.
[01:11:51.313 --> 01:11:53.174]  We said that last Friday over and over again.
[01:11:54.074 --> 01:11:56.595]  And we said attacks on schools, attacks on minorities.
[01:11:57.515 --> 01:11:59.256]  They'll have the perfect white supremacist cutout.
[01:12:00.447 --> 01:12:04.851]  An autistic person that was highly suggestible and now reports of all these other shooters.
[01:12:05.351 --> 01:12:10.635]  Leader of white nationalist group confirms Florida shooting suspect is member of his organization.
[01:12:12.157 --> 01:12:14.719]  So we've got the left trying to cause race war in this country.
[01:12:15.842 --> 01:12:26.030]  And now, the suspect in the Florida shooting was reportedly a member of White Supremacist Group, a representative of the Republican Florida organization called Multiple Outlets that suspect Nicholas Cruz was a member.
[01:12:26.831 --> 01:12:28.933]  The group wants Florida to become a white ethnostate.
[01:12:29.673 --> 01:12:34.978]  Jonathan Gerbe told the Associated Press that Mr. Cruz had participated in paramilitary drills.
[01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:37.220]  So this is really getting crazy.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:41.023]  Jalen Martin, thank you for all your time and interest and courage today.
[01:12:41.463 --> 01:12:44.726]  What do you make of this latest development with what we were just breaking down?
[01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:52.065]  I think this is, uh, there has to be, like, for sure, a second shooter.
[01:12:52.366 --> 01:12:55.087]  I think they need to keep investigating that.
[01:12:56.368 --> 01:13:06.213]  They shouldn't just sweep this under the rug as some other, you know, school shooting where there was a lone gunman and then everyone's up in arms saying, hey, we need gun control.
[01:13:06.233 --> 01:13:07.834]  Everyone needs to take the guns away.
[01:13:07.874 --> 01:13:14.197]  That's why I said, I was talking to this guy, you know, near the school and he was telling me,
[01:13:15.983 --> 01:13:21.587]  You know, these teachers, they would be able to protect the students, had they just had the ability to fight back.
[01:13:21.928 --> 01:13:28.493]  He said, when you have a gun, and you're going against someone who's trying to shoot you, you're equalizing the balance of power.
[01:13:29.033 --> 01:13:37.761]  That's exactly what needs to happen, because, you see, there's a teacher laying on the floor in one video that I saw, with blood everywhere, and the teachers are in the center walking out.
[01:13:38.621 --> 01:13:44.106]  This type of stuff could have been completely, maybe not stopped, but diminished.
[01:13:45.083 --> 01:13:45.543]  Quite a bit.
[01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:50.866]  Had a teacher had a gun in that building and was able to shoot back and kill him.
[01:13:52.307 --> 01:13:53.307]  Kill him or wound him.
[01:13:55.068 --> 01:14:02.212]  And as far as new news coming out, I mean, I don't really know right now.
[01:14:02.512 --> 01:14:07.575]  I'm about to look up some more stuff and talk to more people.
[01:14:08.155 --> 01:14:12.177]  But my neighbor, she got shot and she's in the hospital.
[01:14:12.797 --> 01:14:13.958]  I'm hoping she's okay.
[01:14:15.479 --> 01:14:24.062]  Yeah, because I noticed last night when I came home that her parents weren't there and one of her brothers opened the door and was like, hey, she got shot.
[01:14:24.983 --> 01:14:26.143]  We don't know where she is, actually.
[01:14:26.223 --> 01:14:28.164]  Well, Jalen, our prayers go out to everybody.
[01:14:29.044 --> 01:14:30.465]  You've already got a YouTube channel.
[01:14:31.105 --> 01:14:32.406]  Go shoot reports with witnesses.
[01:14:32.486 --> 01:14:32.906]  Upload them.
[01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:34.447]  You can be an InfoWars reporter right now.
[01:14:35.127 --> 01:14:37.408]  And so, I mean, let's get you on board.
[01:14:37.468 --> 01:14:37.828]  You're there.
[01:14:38.268 --> 01:14:54.630]  We appreciate your courage and your thoughtful coverage of all this and so please get out there, interview as many eyewitnesses as you can because you see multiple news channels not wanting to air the reports of multiple shooters despite the fact that reporters are pushing for that.
[01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:55.411]  What do you make of that?
[01:14:58.208 --> 01:15:07.091]  I think this idea of, like, hiding what is true and what is likely true is just something that has become normal nowadays.
[01:15:07.171 --> 01:15:16.595]  I think that once they are out there, they don't want to have to say something that contradicts what they've already said, because they don't want to have that fake news moniker, even though they've already taken it.
[01:15:16.895 --> 01:15:24.018]  They just might as well just go ahead and correct it and give the truth, instead of trying to hide behind a lie and not make it seem like, hey, we lied about something.
[01:15:24.978 --> 01:15:25.419]  We're good to go.
[01:15:42.461 --> 01:15:43.642]  The dead and of course the families.
[01:15:44.523 --> 01:15:54.010]  But wow, we said the perfect false flag would be a white nationalist attacking a multicultural school as a way to make the leftists all look like victims and bring in gun control and a war on America's recovery.
[01:15:54.310 --> 01:16:00.815]  And now right on time, what we've been warning of, their main card, the thing we said was imminent, it appears with all the evidence.
[01:16:01.095 --> 01:16:05.838]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[01:16:06.098 --> 01:16:11.662]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[01:16:11.742 --> 01:16:20.808]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[01:16:20.968 --> 01:16:28.774]  So go to fortifiedsupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[01:16:28.874 --> 01:16:30.555]  That's fortifiedsupply.com.
[01:16:36.218 --> 01:16:38.200]  Can you beat Oprah, by the way?
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.200]  Yeah, I'll beat Oprah.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.981]  Oprah would be a lot of fun.
[01:16:41.081 --> 01:16:42.182]  I know her very well.
[01:16:42.402 --> 01:16:43.943]  You know, I did one of her last shows.
[01:16:44.003 --> 01:16:44.984]  She had Donald Trump.
[01:16:45.024 --> 01:16:45.965]  It was before politics.
[01:16:46.325 --> 01:16:47.165]  Her last week.
[01:16:47.806 --> 01:16:50.147]  And she had Donald Trump, and my family was very blessed.
[01:16:50.187 --> 01:16:51.008]  So I like Oprah.
[01:16:51.568 --> 01:16:54.951]  I don't think she's going to run.
[01:16:55.071 --> 01:16:56.172]  I don't think she's going to run.
[01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:58.414]  I know her very well.
[01:16:58.474 --> 01:17:00.496]  Gavin McGinnis, he agrees with the president.
[01:17:00.536 --> 01:17:05.860]  Hillary Clinton is nothing compared to Oprah Winfrey when you talk about incredible skeletons.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.543]  And if she thinks she's really going to run in 2020, I think it's a bluff.
[01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:10.664]  Trump thinks it's a bluff.
[01:17:10.744 --> 01:17:13.566]  But Gavin McGinnis, he's really up on his Oprah history.
[01:17:14.507 --> 01:17:15.528]  Gavin, I mean,
[01:17:15.808 --> 01:17:21.950]  Look, there's nothing wrong with being a prostitute, but pimping women, bringing women to Weinstein, all of it.
[01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.090]  This is mainstream news.
[01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:26.631]  Let's talk about why you think she's unelectable.
[01:17:26.971 --> 01:17:33.613]  You think of, you know, the identity politics vote, the woman vote, the bitter vote, the millennial vote, the dumb vote.
[01:17:33.953 --> 01:17:37.894]  She's got all of these different votes that end up being more than 50% of the country.
[01:17:38.234 --> 01:17:42.775]  The people who generally have skin in the game and get politics, they're a minority.
[01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:47.858]  So I was kind of scared and then I talked to Roger Stone a second ago and he goes, dude, relax.
[01:17:48.259 --> 01:17:51.141]  Can you imagine the kind of skeletons this woman has in her closet?
[01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:52.422]  And then he dropped it.
[01:17:52.522 --> 01:17:53.162]  But he's right.
[01:17:53.242 --> 01:17:54.303]  She's a lesbian.
[01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.325]  So I just think that Trump was alluding to that.
[01:17:57.345 --> 01:18:01.648]  And we've heard stories of her paying off people to hide lesbian affairs.
[01:18:02.369 --> 01:18:06.212]  She tried to hide that her husband was, I mean, her brother was gay, died of AIDS.
[01:18:06.612 --> 01:18:09.374]  She's tried to hide the fact that she didn't really grow up in poverty.
[01:18:09.674 --> 01:18:16.144]  I mean, she's such an obvious liar, and that works for daytime TV, but it won't work in politics, where everything has to be aired out.
[01:18:16.344 --> 01:18:17.706]  She doesn't have a chance in hell.
[01:18:17.967 --> 01:18:22.614]  And when we watch the Golden Globes, too, we know Mira Cervino isn't there, because she said no.
[01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:25.138]  But everyone else, you look at them and you go,
[01:18:25.718 --> 01:18:26.459]  Well, you're here.
[01:18:26.699 --> 01:18:27.600]  Did you say yes?
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:33.924]  I mean, Salma Hayek pretends she was a victim, but she did the lesbian scene in the movie for Weinstein.
[01:18:34.144 --> 01:18:43.911]  All these people followed the rules, and now after they've done this, which is really just very expensive prostitution, they put on their low-slung black dresses and go, me too.
[01:18:44.312 --> 01:18:44.972]  It's over now.
[01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:46.954]  I'm gonna stop being an expensive prostitute.
[01:18:47.294 --> 01:18:48.515]  No, sorry, it doesn't work like that.
[01:18:48.555 --> 01:18:50.316]  You can't get on your high horse when it's fashionable.
[01:18:50.436 --> 01:18:52.558]  Look, we know what Time's Up means.
[01:18:53.138 --> 01:19:00.404]  It means I knew, we all knew, we let it go, but now the jig is up and everyone can see the casting couch.
[01:19:00.685 --> 01:19:04.408]  So starting today, we're not going to popularize it anymore.
[01:19:04.428 --> 01:19:05.489]  We're not going to ignore it.
[01:19:05.889 --> 01:19:07.250]  Ooh, how brave!
[01:19:07.631 --> 01:19:13.416]  You let a thousand rapes go under the radar and starting today, you say time's up.
[01:19:13.716 --> 01:19:15.738]  You're not going to allow rape anymore because it went public?
[01:19:16.238 --> 01:19:16.659]  Wow!
[01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:19.281]  What a crusader for justice you are!
[01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.682]  We're so impressed, you feminists!
[01:19:21.983 --> 01:19:22.803]  You want to get raped?
[01:19:23.044 --> 01:19:23.904]  You want to get abused?
[01:19:24.064 --> 01:19:24.905]  You want to get killed?
[01:19:24.925 --> 01:19:25.886]  Go to Hollywood!
[01:19:31.508 --> 01:19:38.754]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:39.214 --> 01:19:48.382]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[01:19:48.642 --> 01:19:53.766]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[01:19:54.047 --> 01:19:56.889]  It also funds the InfoWar, a total 360 win.
[01:19:57.309 --> 01:19:59.931]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:08.051]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:28.598]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:20:29.098 --> 01:20:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:20:34.525 --> 01:20:54.214]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can now officially say that it's about a 90% chance that the Florida event at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that's killed 17 people and injured over 20 is a deep state false flag operation.
[01:20:56.243 --> 01:21:06.071]  We have multiple news reports of credible witnesses saying they saw the supposed shooter unarmed walking down the hall while shooting was going on down the building.
[01:21:06.672 --> 01:21:12.837]  And that people were pinned on both exits being driven up into the third floor being shot and witnessed teachers being killed.
[01:21:13.458 --> 01:21:16.360]  We have video of the news stations doing the interviews.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.605]  People shot cell phone footage, but that didn't air from KPRC and others.
[01:21:23.356 --> 01:21:29.720]  KHOU, that was there covering baseball, they interviewed people, but it didn't air on the news.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.681]  The reporter put it out on his Twitter.
[01:21:33.702 --> 01:21:35.243]  What did I say a month ago?
[01:21:35.303 --> 01:21:36.384]  What did I say last week?
[01:21:36.404 --> 01:21:38.885]  What did I say when Matt Bracken, counterterrorism expert, was on?
[01:21:38.905 --> 01:21:39.706]  Just, what was it, Friday?
[01:21:40.446 --> 01:21:41.607]  I said, you watch.
[01:21:42.968 --> 01:21:47.891]  The only card the globalists have to derail our nationalism is what's in the WikiLeaks, race war.
[01:21:50.223 --> 01:22:15.880]  And just like there was clear, credible evidence that they knew about what happened with the fella a few years ago, the idiot scumbag that went in and shot the nine people at the black church, Dylan Roof, that an event like that is exactly what the globalists would do imminently to try to create racial division in this country and derail the nation and the fact that black unemployment's at record low levels and the rest of it.
[01:22:16.744 --> 01:22:24.471]  And now you've got all these witnesses we just had on, high school seniors like Jalen Martin and others that say nobody's buying the official story.
[01:22:24.731 --> 01:22:27.094]  They had weird SWAT team drills there in the weeks before.
[01:22:27.854 --> 01:22:29.776]  The teachers think there's something going on.
[01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:36.342]  You've got the police and everybody showing up right as the shooting starts.
[01:22:39.085 --> 01:22:39.765]  It's incredible.
[01:22:39.925 --> 01:22:40.266]  And then...
[01:22:41.912 --> 01:22:52.897]  Leader of white nationalist group, right on time, most of these things are fed run, confirms Florida shooting suspect is member of his organization and that they did paramilitary training together.
[01:22:57.213 --> 01:23:02.655]  Just like Oklahoma City was run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and that's where McVeigh was, and that was the main white supremacist compound.
[01:23:03.475 --> 01:23:13.878]  And it was run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and protected by the ATF and the Clinton-controlled FBI, and then Eric Holder, Deputy Attorney General at the time, in 1995.
[01:23:14.658 --> 01:23:15.079]  Look it up.
[01:23:16.359 --> 01:23:19.540]  So, I've been telling you, a new Oklahoma City is imminent.
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:25.482]  Attacks on multicultural schools, primary schools,
[01:23:27.193 --> 01:23:36.058]  Colleges, churches, federal buildings, to make the globalist deep state the victims, this is the card.
[01:23:36.158 --> 01:23:53.107]  And then, you saw Michael Hastings' wife, who used to sit as one of the main gophers on the National Security Council under Obama, openly saying, a week and a half ago, if you release the memo, there will be giant massacres of liberals.
[01:23:54.454 --> 01:23:55.194]  By right-wingers.
[01:23:55.855 --> 01:23:57.115]  I'm not saying she's involved.
[01:23:57.556 --> 01:23:58.776]  I want to know who told her to say that.
[01:23:58.796 --> 01:24:07.861]  And then we saw other people say, Chuckie Schumer and others, a bunch of them said there's going to be new Oklahoma cities.
[01:24:08.221 --> 01:24:10.282]  Just last week, three different senators.
[01:24:10.622 --> 01:24:11.862]  Who was it last week?
[01:24:12.263 --> 01:24:12.883]  Three different ones.
[01:24:12.963 --> 01:24:15.704]  And I said, this is the message being sent.
[01:24:16.125 --> 01:24:18.286]  This is unbelievable.
[01:24:21.607 --> 01:24:22.908]  And then right on time,
[01:24:24.446 --> 01:24:27.689]  All of this kicks off, so seeing is believing.
[01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:40.582]  I've got to get some of the crew over there to go back to Matt Bracken on Friday, because I know we said it a bunch then, and there's countless reports where I said false flag is the only move the Globalists had to derail the nation coming together.
[01:24:43.636 --> 01:24:50.861]  And it's the only card they've got left after the hurricanes brought us together, and after the tax cuts brought us together, and after Trump and the Pride for America.
[01:24:51.442 --> 01:24:55.484]  Adam Schiff said that an Oklahoma City-style bombing could happen because of FISA memo as well.
[01:24:55.825 --> 01:24:56.825]  That's the Daily Caller!
[01:24:57.666 --> 01:24:58.466]  February 8th!
[01:24:58.687 --> 01:25:04.491]  I mean, it doesn't get any worse when they're on TV with Phil Mudd, who
[01:25:05.111 --> 01:25:09.552]  He calls himself a proud asshole on TV and then says they're going to kill the president.
[01:25:10.012 --> 01:25:12.493]  Now he breaks down crying and it's the fake, total fake.
[01:25:12.533 --> 01:25:20.156]  I mean, it's like a high school play, but he turns to the side and goes, worse than Obama's fake crying when he used to run counter-terrorism.
[01:25:20.216 --> 01:25:24.517]  Oh, he's so scared of death and how he hates ISIS when he helped basically create it with Obama.
[01:25:25.509 --> 01:25:28.511]  I mean, this guy, this is the scum that rules us.
[01:25:28.551 --> 01:25:31.492]  They don't even tell you he's former deputy director of the CIA.
[01:25:31.792 --> 01:25:32.973]  They don't tell you any of that when he's on there.
[01:25:32.993 --> 01:25:34.534]  It's, oh, an FBI agent saw him.
[01:25:35.094 --> 01:25:45.819]  He was sent over by Obama to take over the FBI by Mueller for globalist elements of the CIA in a foreign penetration of the FBI to fully take it over.
[01:25:45.839 --> 01:25:50.422]  It's not the CIA, it's the globalists that have penetrated it.
[01:25:50.962 --> 01:25:55.024]  And Phil Mudd is the main adjunct and the aide-de-camp to Robert Mueller.
[01:25:56.072 --> 01:25:58.673]  So he goes on TV and says the government's gonna kill the president.
[01:25:59.453 --> 01:26:02.894]  That is a message to all their stay-behind networks that we're gonna win.
[01:26:03.975 --> 01:26:08.076]  And now he gets to wear the bloody shirt and say it's all you gun owners and Trump's fault.
[01:26:08.376 --> 01:26:09.197]  Poor children!
[01:26:11.557 --> 01:26:12.998]  Children of God!
[01:26:18.055 --> 01:26:21.156]  This is worse than a middle school play.
[01:26:21.817 --> 01:26:26.718]  Just like Obama starts the fake crying years ago and then tries to touch his eye to show there's a tear.
[01:26:28.779 --> 01:26:34.722]  I mean, this is just horse manure by the fake news channel CNN.
[01:26:34.742 --> 01:26:34.722]  110%.
[01:26:35.142 --> 01:26:38.443]  So we got those clubs coming up as well.
[01:26:38.483 --> 01:26:39.404]  We got a hold of Matt Bracken.
[01:26:39.424 --> 01:26:40.044]  He's coming on.
[01:26:40.084 --> 01:26:43.205]  But we have absolutely 100% got to.
[01:26:49.813 --> 01:26:52.295]  Go get what about a hundred times?
[01:26:53.356 --> 01:26:56.278]  The last month I said they're gonna shoot up a school.
[01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:58.179]  They're gonna bomb a federal building.
[01:26:58.199 --> 01:26:58.499]  You know what?
[01:26:58.519 --> 01:26:59.340]  They're gonna do it all.
[01:27:00.801 --> 01:27:05.825]  I've interviewed the police officers that survived, interviewed the widows, the cops that got tortured to death like Terrence Yankie.
[01:27:06.225 --> 01:27:11.869]  I've interviewed Don Browning, the head of the Marine Corps veteran, Holly
[01:27:13.183 --> 01:27:14.003]  We're good to go.
[01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:42.851]  He said, all right, I'll name them.
[01:27:42.871 --> 01:27:43.492]  And he named them!
[01:27:44.794 --> 01:27:47.056]  Once at the water cooler and another time in his office.
[01:27:47.076 --> 01:27:50.339]  They said, Don, you and your wife don't want to die.
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.921]  You shut your effing mouth.
[01:27:51.961 --> 01:27:52.582]  You understand?
[01:27:54.644 --> 01:27:57.888]  Well, he didn't shut his effing mouth because not everybody's cowards like you.
[01:28:00.325 --> 01:28:01.866]  I'm not saying the whole FBI is even bad.
[01:28:02.086 --> 01:28:03.587]  It's a civil war in our own hearts.
[01:28:04.228 --> 01:28:05.369]  Individuals by individuals.
[01:28:05.429 --> 01:28:06.249]  Is a college bad?
[01:28:06.309 --> 01:28:06.490]  No.
[01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:07.410]  There's good people, bad people.
[01:28:07.751 --> 01:28:08.491]  Is the FBI bad?
[01:28:08.531 --> 01:28:08.611]  No.
[01:28:08.631 --> 01:28:10.433]  There's good people, bad people.
[01:28:10.533 --> 01:28:11.333]  It's the same thing.
[01:28:11.733 --> 01:28:12.194]  It's people.
[01:28:12.934 --> 01:28:16.057]  And denying there's evil in some of these government agencies has allowed it to grow.
[01:28:16.297 --> 01:28:22.101]  We've got a rogue multinational group funded by the communist Chinese and others, and allied with the Vatican.
[01:28:22.281 --> 01:28:25.304]  The Pope's endorsed communism, said China is the key to everything.
[01:28:26.064 --> 01:28:32.152]  That are running this country and we're removing them right now and the prosperity is coming back and they're pissed and they're scared.
[01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:35.296]  I mean, you look at Phil Mudd.
[01:28:35.336 --> 01:28:36.398]  He is a lunatic.
[01:28:36.658 --> 01:28:37.339]  And I looked him up.
[01:28:37.359 --> 01:28:38.961]  He's from the Virginia Mudd family.
[01:28:39.952 --> 01:28:40.953]  And traces his lineage.
[01:28:40.973 --> 01:28:43.274]  I spent hours on Ancestry looking this up.
[01:28:43.314 --> 01:28:44.295]  I paid to get in there.
[01:28:44.635 --> 01:28:49.878]  And it looks like he is the offspring of Dr. Mudd, the only other person convicted for killing Lincoln.
[01:28:50.338 --> 01:28:58.523]  And now here he is saying he wants to kill another Republican president on TV when it looks like he is the heir to that term.
[01:28:58.843 --> 01:29:00.024]  Your name will be Mudd.
[01:29:01.525 --> 01:29:04.306]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:29:04.926 --> 01:29:08.487]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:29:08.887 --> 01:29:11.848]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:29:12.228 --> 01:29:14.228]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:29:14.768 --> 01:29:19.170]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:21.570]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:28.232]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:29:28.872 --> 01:29:36.078]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:29:37.059 --> 01:29:41.723]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:29:42.124 --> 01:29:49.110]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:54.211]  Boost, protect and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:29:54.671 --> 01:30:00.153]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.

[01:30:41.092 --> 01:30:47.534]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[01:30:47.894 --> 01:30:50.515]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.

[01:31:01.519 --> 01:31:10.545]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:31:10.605 --> 01:31:18.731]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:19.011 --> 01:31:23.714]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:31:23.874 --> 01:31:30.598]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:30.678 --> 01:31:37.763]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:31:37.863 --> 01:31:44.707]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:31:44.867 --> 01:31:49.211]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:31:49.352 --> 01:31:52.615]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:31:52.735 --> 01:31:58.881]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:31:59.041 --> 01:32:00.723]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:32:02.324 --> 01:32:06.390]  Brett Smith, author of Thump, The First Hundred Days.
[01:32:07.091 --> 01:32:10.596]  Explain to people about Thump and why this is an important book and how it ties into things.
[01:32:10.956 --> 01:32:13.119]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[01:32:13.299 --> 01:32:17.946]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the president.
[01:32:18.046 --> 01:32:22.850]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:28.775]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable, fluffy little bunny?
[01:32:29.035 --> 01:32:31.538]  It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[01:32:31.578 --> 01:32:32.679]  It's actually hilarious.
[01:32:32.759 --> 01:32:34.220]  I was cracking up reading the whole book.
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.201]  My wife was cracking up.
[01:32:35.421 --> 01:32:36.502]  It's a great book for adults.
[01:32:36.522 --> 01:32:37.543]  It's a great book for children.
[01:32:37.563 --> 01:32:38.923]  We're selling the book.
[01:32:39.184 --> 01:32:45.108]  We've got it bundled as well here with a one-off poster that's a collector's item.
[01:32:45.288 --> 01:32:48.550]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the poster are $29.95.
[01:32:48.650 --> 01:32:50.432]  That helps support us.
[01:32:50.652 --> 01:32:51.672]  So get the book, Thump!
[01:32:51.772 --> 01:32:53.994]  The First Hundred Days, and Alex Jones and Thump!

[01:33:05.333 --> 01:33:09.495]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.003 --> 01:33:27.764]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[01:33:28.085 --> 01:33:32.287]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:39.853 --> 01:33:56.807]  To be specifically clear, last week, more than 10 times on air, we're going to find it and dig it up, I said a new Oklahoma City attack on a church, a school, or a federal building blamed on right-wing terrorist Tim McVeigh, Part 2.
[01:33:56.907 --> 01:33:57.808]  Now, why did I say that?
[01:33:58.908 --> 01:34:13.431]  You had Congressman Schiff, you had senators, you had globalist operatives going on, MSNBC, CNN, saying there's going to be massacres if you release the memo.
[01:34:14.792 --> 01:34:16.632]  You're going to cause right-wingers to kill us.
[01:34:18.333 --> 01:34:28.315]  And then just like Oklahoma City, they had Elohim City, outside Oklahoma City, set up and run, commanded, not infiltrated, by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:38.997]  And the informants and everything went public and said, look, we knew this was coming and we're told to stand down by the ATF and by the criminal elements of the FBI.
[01:34:39.338 --> 01:34:44.742]  And then they bombed the building to blame the libertarian liberty movement that was taking the country back.
[01:34:44.982 --> 01:34:54.951]  And Bill Clinton said on Air Force One the next year in 1996 that he owed his re-election to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:58.582]  So, their whole global system's falling apart.
[01:34:58.903 --> 01:35:01.065]  The left's been caught running antifa that's cop-killing.
[01:35:01.305 --> 01:35:04.188]  They've been caught in their own documents that came out a month ago.
[01:35:04.448 --> 01:35:16.901]  George Soros' son funding movements trying to get national riots going when Obama was in, in 2015, to be able to triggle, triggle, Trigglypuff, trigger civil war.
[01:35:19.192 --> 01:35:21.213]  And there's the articles we have on Infowars.com.
[01:35:21.413 --> 01:35:26.535]  Adam Schiff implies that Oklahoma City-style bombing could happen because of FISA memo.
[01:35:27.275 --> 01:35:29.596]  So you can see exactly what they're saying.
[01:35:30.056 --> 01:35:44.182]  And then someone that fits not the profile of a nihilist like we were thinking, but someone who is completely mentally ill, autistic, totally suggestible, will do whatever he's told, on psychotropic drugs, who doesn't have parents, it's in the news,
[01:35:45.692 --> 01:35:49.473]  Magically is there, and all the eyewitnesses are saying multiple shooters.
[01:35:51.713 --> 01:36:03.655]  We are getting Matt Bracken on, but I may go to rebroadcast for a while, just so, because I got a bunch of clips we haven't played yet, so it's not really rebroadcast, so I can get on a computer terminal, and no big deal, and find these clips.
[01:36:04.115 --> 01:36:11.916]  Because it's not clips of us saying they're going to stage more attacks on Congress like they already did, and more hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:36:12.157 --> 01:36:13.317]  We know they're doing that.
[01:36:13.597 --> 01:36:14.557]  We've got those clips.
[01:36:15.390 --> 01:36:33.285]  We're talking about the clips you all heard and I all heard over and over again probably five hundred times the last six months uh... but uh... we're talking ten times last week I remember I mean I said it ten times on Friday when Bracken was on or was it even Monday?
[01:36:33.365 --> 01:36:35.367]  I mean I can't even keep track of this.
[01:36:35.407 --> 01:36:41.813]  We have to show people that because that's how they then get the understanding that these
[01:36:43.379 --> 01:36:45.260]  The church shooting in Texas, all of it.
[01:36:46.321 --> 01:36:47.682]  We know the FBI was told.
[01:36:47.722 --> 01:36:48.903]  We know they knew specifics.
[01:36:48.963 --> 01:36:52.265]  They knew that they were warned for years that this guy was highly suggestible.
[01:36:52.645 --> 01:36:54.826]  And now we've got witnesses of the multiple shooters.
[01:36:55.166 --> 01:36:57.328]  This is incredible!
[01:37:00.515 --> 01:37:02.757]  And this is how the globalists want to beat the country.
[01:37:03.077 --> 01:37:06.760]  We're beating them with the economics, we're beating them with the unity, the sovereignty, the military.
[01:37:07.281 --> 01:37:08.161]  America's coming back.
[01:37:08.602 --> 01:37:10.063]  It's going back under its own control.
[01:37:10.904 --> 01:37:20.572]  And they're going to use destabilization operations like Vegas that we were way ahead of, and that we documented, and that we said he was a gun dealer, and that he'd been to the Middle East.
[01:37:20.612 --> 01:37:22.073]  That was from the hostage rescue team.
[01:37:22.273 --> 01:37:23.654]  That was from the good guys at the FBI.
[01:37:24.955 --> 01:37:30.580]  Illustrating how when the media says we criticize FBI corruption or government corruption, we hate the whole government.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:33.903]  No, we want good government, transparent government back.
[01:37:35.164 --> 01:37:37.266]  So let's go ahead and play these clips one after the other.
[01:37:37.806 --> 01:37:40.969]  Here's a clip of KPRC interviewing a student.
[01:37:40.989 --> 01:37:42.490]  We don't know her name because they didn't air it.
[01:37:43.431 --> 01:37:48.915]  But it's someone videotaping with their phone over the shoulder capturing the young student
[01:37:49.727 --> 01:38:07.235]  The high school student laying out how there were two shooters funneling them in, and then it's not just that, we got a woman, a high school senior, she's a woman, who knew him the year before he got expelled, said, I thought it'd be you doing all the shooting, while the shooting's still going on!
[01:38:07.255 --> 01:38:10.256]  It's not like some young woman got confused about shooters.
[01:38:11.457 --> 01:38:18.340]  The Hispanic lady, high school student, young lady, she sees her teacher shot in the head,
[01:38:20.467 --> 01:38:21.628]  And it's not on the news?
[01:38:24.230 --> 01:38:26.312]  The CHOU didn't air.
[01:38:26.592 --> 01:38:28.013]  We had to get it off his Twitter.
[01:38:28.093 --> 01:38:28.774]  He put it out.
[01:38:28.814 --> 01:38:29.894]  The reporter put it out.
[01:38:33.017 --> 01:38:33.657]  Think about that.
[01:38:33.697 --> 01:38:34.118]  Let's start.
[01:38:34.398 --> 01:38:36.059]  Let's go to the full clip of the Hispanic lady.
[01:38:36.299 --> 01:38:38.621]  Then we'll go to the full clip of Alexa.
[01:38:40.322 --> 01:38:41.804]  And then we'll have more.
[01:38:41.824 --> 01:38:46.988]  We had an eyewitness on as well earlier who says he thinks the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[01:38:47.008 --> 01:38:48.089]  Let's start playing those clips.
[01:38:48.109 --> 01:38:48.409]  Here they are.
[01:38:49.369 --> 01:38:55.192]  And then I thank God to this teacher who opened up her door and let all of us in.
[01:38:55.212 --> 01:38:57.373]  She got shot in the arm trying to open the door.
[01:38:57.433 --> 01:39:01.035]  And then the other teacher, he got shot in the head trying to cut the other students.
[01:39:14.842 --> 01:39:18.025]  It was like an hour, it felt like years waiting for them.
[01:39:18.105 --> 01:39:28.413]  And then after all that, we finally got out and they started yelling at us to keep focused and to pay attention ahead, the army, because they didn't want us to see the bodies that they hid in the corners.
[01:39:28.493 --> 01:39:34.598]  And we were putting mats over them so we wouldn't see them, but there was dust all over the floor.
[01:39:34.638 --> 01:39:36.719]  The, like, your English grew in there.
[01:39:36.739 --> 01:39:39.421]  Do you think there was more than one shooter?
[01:39:39.461 --> 01:39:40.462]  There was three shooters.
[01:39:40.502 --> 01:39:41.263]  Definitely.
[01:39:44.047 --> 01:39:44.768]  How terrifying?
[01:39:44.828 --> 01:39:45.528]  Hold on one second, ma'am.
[01:39:45.649 --> 01:39:46.249]  How terrifying?
[01:39:46.329 --> 01:39:50.372]  It was pretty damn terrifying, because they were putting us through jails, and we all thought this was a drill.
[01:39:50.392 --> 01:39:51.093]  I'll call you right back.
[01:39:51.133 --> 01:39:53.054]  We thought this was a drill, but it wasn't.
[01:39:53.074 --> 01:39:54.755]  And then we just started hearing gunshots.
[01:39:54.775 --> 01:40:02.221]  And it was really terrifying, because my class, the class I ran into, he started shooting through the door, and he came through, and he started shooting the cabinets, and that's when he shot the teacher.
[01:40:02.601 --> 01:40:07.603]  And then they started, and then he ran back outside to shoot the other teacher who was closing the other door for the kids.
[01:40:07.643 --> 01:40:10.504]  But he didn't get to close the door, and he was just there.
[01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:14.065]  And so we were all just sushing each other, like, shut up, just suck it up.
[01:40:14.105 --> 01:40:15.786]  We were crying, because we're not trying to get shot.
[01:40:15.806 --> 01:40:22.348]  Because he was in the hallway, yelling, hey, hey, trying to taunt us and get us to say things, trying to get us outside.
[01:40:22.608 --> 01:40:25.850]  And that's when some other kid, like, he ran out, because he thought it was free.
[01:40:26.050 --> 01:40:28.751]  But he got shot, and then we heard the groaning outside.
[01:40:29.431 --> 01:40:30.932]  And we couldn't do anything.
[01:40:30.952 --> 01:40:34.175]  So the shooter, tell me, besides, hey, hey, what was he saying during all this?
[01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:34.916]  He wasn't doing anything.
[01:40:34.996 --> 01:40:38.319]  He was legit, he just ran up the stairs, started shooting.
[01:40:38.339 --> 01:40:53.652]  I actually was in the bathroom at the moment, and I came back to my classroom, and I knocked on the door, and the fire alarm went off, and the principal came on the speaker and just said, everyone needs to evacuate right now.
[01:40:53.752 --> 01:40:54.753]  So that's what we did.
[01:40:56.153 --> 01:40:59.334]  As I was going down the stairs, I heard a couple shots fired.
[01:40:59.654 --> 01:41:02.895]  Everyone was freaking out, saying that it was a gun.
[01:41:03.795 --> 01:41:12.557]  And as we were walking, the whole class together, I actually was speaking to the suspect, Nicholas Cruz.
[01:41:13.997 --> 01:41:15.678]  And as I was speaking to him,
[01:41:16.818 --> 01:41:23.941]  He seemed very... I don't know what the word I want to say is, but he was trouble in middle school.
[01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:28.663]  So I kind of joked to him about it and said, I'm surprised you weren't the one who did it.
[01:41:29.323 --> 01:41:30.604]  And he just gave me a huh.
[01:41:31.544 --> 01:41:33.965]  So that's really what happened.
[01:41:34.525 --> 01:41:37.667]  You were walking down the hall he had already fired at that time?
[01:41:38.167 --> 01:41:38.767]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:38.827 --> 01:41:39.327]  With him.
[01:41:40.388 --> 01:41:41.008]  Weren't you scared?
[01:41:43.071 --> 01:41:52.359]  Um, in the moment I wasn't, because there was obviously, definitely another shooter involved, but... Oh, you think he was not the only one?
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:52.960]  No.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:54.461]  Definitely not.
[01:41:55.102 --> 01:41:55.922]  Why do you say that?
[01:41:57.123 --> 01:42:02.147]  Um, because when shots were fired, I saw him after the fact.
[01:42:03.228 --> 01:42:10.775]  So, and the shots were coming from the other part of the building, so there definitely had to be two shooters involved, I believe.
[01:42:11.563 --> 01:42:12.829]  That's the first I've heard of that.
[01:42:13.090 --> 01:42:16.004]  Did you see any other students who were wounded?
[01:42:17.132 --> 01:42:17.673]  Um, no sir.
[01:42:48.854 --> 01:42:52.557]  By the way, I just got information during those clips.
[01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:56.260]  There is no doubt there were multiple shooters.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.081]  This is their move against America.
[01:42:59.182 --> 01:43:01.364]  They got an autistic kid to set up yet again.

[01:45:04.522 --> 01:45:11.305]  This is the best deal we've ever offered on our flagship product, DNA Force.
[01:45:11.445 --> 01:45:13.306]  And it's got a very interesting story behind it.
[01:45:13.446 --> 01:45:19.149]  I was at a medical doctor's clinic facility that had top-of-the-line nutraceuticals and was noticing that they were $200 to $400.
[01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:29.954]  And then I talked to my dad about it, who is a physician, and he said, absolutely, this is the biggest area in nutraceuticals and supplements is longevity and keeping your telomeres in place.
[01:45:29.974 --> 01:45:32.756]  You can't make telomeres grow, you can just make them not shrink as fast.
[01:45:33.376 --> 01:45:54.734]  We designed DNA Force with Dr. Group, and Dr. Group's a great guy, but then we were going to come out with Cell Force, because I was able to find just as good of the same compounds for a lower price, and was able to develop Cell Force, and Group liked the formula so much, he said, listen, we were going to come out with DNA Force Plus, you just use that name and do it, because this is such an incredible formula.
[01:45:55.234 --> 01:46:00.799]  And I understand you're going to one of the biggest labs in the country, and so you were able to scale up and lower price, and I want to do that.
[01:46:01.179 --> 01:46:06.303]  He was so classy, he just said, you just put out DNA Force Plus as Cell Force, or vice versa.
[01:46:06.483 --> 01:46:07.504]  I was partnering with him on that.
[01:46:07.524 --> 01:46:08.525]  That's how classy he is.
[01:46:08.585 --> 01:46:10.546]  So, Cell Force is a limited run.
[01:46:10.626 --> 01:46:12.068]  When it's gone, it's gone.
[01:46:12.168 --> 01:46:19.053]  It will be called DNA Force Plus, because it's stronger than the old DNA Force, and it is less money.
[01:46:19.073 --> 01:46:22.036]  So it's a good deal normally at $149, like DNA Force was, and we'd sell it for $99.
[01:46:23.937 --> 01:46:24.357]  On sale.
[01:46:24.437 --> 01:46:25.117]  We're selling it for $70.45.
[01:46:25.157 --> 01:46:30.199]  Used to, that's almost what it cost to make a bottle of DNA Force.
[01:46:30.219 --> 01:46:33.220]  Well, now we've lowered the price on the ingredients by buying even more.
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:35.540]  Just as high quality, we're lowering it for you.
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.941]  This is the best deal ever on DNA Force.
[01:46:38.361 --> 01:46:41.082]  It's DNA Force Plus, but called Cell Force.
[01:46:41.562 --> 01:46:54.090]  Because we weren't going to step on groups toes, we just put out CellForce separately, with a similar name to DNAForce, and it's even stronger and a lower price, super high quality, promotes cellular energy production, supports optimal mental health, and so much more.
[01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:55.470]  And it supports the InfoWar.
[01:46:55.651 --> 01:46:58.012]  Get the best deal ever at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:47:04.916 --> 01:47:07.538]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:27.509 --> 01:47:33.593]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not just the 17 poor dead young people that had their lives taken from them.
[01:47:34.534 --> 01:47:53.047]  This is the globalist crime syndicate that has funded the radical Islamic takeover of North Africa and much of the Middle East, the murder of millions of people, hundreds of thousands of women and children sold into sex slavery, who are totally ruthless and who have a history of running white supremacist compounds.
[01:47:54.963 --> 01:47:58.945]  With ne'er-do-well federal informants at the head of them.
[01:48:00.426 --> 01:48:12.193]  And then winding up individuals to be patsies like Sirhan Sirhan and the killing of RFK, which the coroner and the LA Times reported his arm was pinned, he didn't shoot RFK.
[01:48:12.773 --> 01:48:17.876]  A guy from the CIA, from the Skunk Works, shot him seven times in the back and that was in front of witnesses.
[01:48:18.617 --> 01:48:20.118]  There's even some footage of it happening.
[01:48:21.241 --> 01:48:43.902]  I'm just saying, these things go on, and they hate me, because I'll go, oh look, here's a KPRC report, very credible high school student, saying exactly what another credible Alexa Mednik said, and she saw the guy she'd seen expelled the year before, Nick Cruz, and said, oh, I thought this would be you doing something like this.
[01:48:46.264 --> 01:48:47.485]  While the shots are going off.
[01:48:48.447 --> 01:48:51.690]  And the point is, this isn't being aired by the TV stations.
[01:48:53.691 --> 01:48:55.613]  We've got cell phone footage of it.
[01:48:56.433 --> 01:48:58.635]  We've got people shooting video of the interviews.
[01:48:58.735 --> 01:49:00.256]  It should be all over the news.
[01:49:00.616 --> 01:49:01.577]  How is it not?
[01:49:04.639 --> 01:49:09.063]  And they dug up Friday, Matt Bracken, where myself and he went on like,
[01:49:10.828 --> 01:49:12.489]  Look, we've done hundreds of times this year already.
[01:49:12.549 --> 01:49:13.590]  Just, we're two months in.
[01:49:14.731 --> 01:49:15.472]  Two and a half months in.
[01:49:15.492 --> 01:49:17.774]  Not even two and a half months in.
[01:49:18.614 --> 01:49:19.155]  Month and a half in.
[01:49:20.556 --> 01:49:24.860]  Saying they're gonna false flag themselves and blame it on us.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:26.881]  I mean, that's a 101, baby.
[01:49:27.262 --> 01:49:30.484]  If I was an evil globalist and way behind like this, it's what I do.
[01:49:30.704 --> 01:49:31.665]  That's what we do.
[01:49:31.745 --> 01:49:32.746]  We war game them.
[01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:34.608]  That's why they hate us.
[01:49:36.015 --> 01:49:37.336]  Trump doesn't do false flags.
[01:49:37.376 --> 01:49:39.017]  He is straight shooter.
[01:49:39.337 --> 01:49:40.618]  Old-fashioned American power.
[01:49:41.038 --> 01:49:58.269]  But the old empires in Europe, you read history books about European wars the last thousand years, that's all they do is massacre villages and blame it on this guy and blow up this ship and blame it on that guy and hang little kids up by their heads and cut their guts out and then put screed that somebody else did it.
[01:49:58.729 --> 01:50:03.953]  I mean, that's what you do when you're 30 behind in a football game at halftime.
[01:50:04.813 --> 01:50:07.894]  You go out and you blow up a school full of your own kids.
[01:50:12.396 --> 01:50:16.938]  And they just can't stand that false flag, inside job, stage terror.
[01:50:18.203 --> 01:50:21.524]  He's now part of the vernacular, but it is thanks to our audience.
[01:50:22.724 --> 01:50:27.865]  I read history books and I brought it back into use, but you made it popular so that people look now!
[01:50:28.365 --> 01:50:36.227]  And how many of these poop swastikas and burning crosses and Jews being attacked, leftist Jews, has been done by the very people?
[01:50:37.288 --> 01:50:37.588]  It's like 99%.
[01:50:39.508 --> 01:50:46.670]  Daily Caller, Breitbart, Fox News have done big listings of them, so have we, where they'll show like, here's 100 plus staged events by leftists this year.
[01:50:48.387 --> 01:50:50.548]  Remember the Air Force Academy, just a few months ago?
[01:50:51.269 --> 01:50:57.193]  Big national news, somebody said no blacks allowed, and it was a black student doing it for attention.
[01:50:58.414 --> 01:51:02.096]  Probably put up to do it by the faculty that's anti-Trump.
[01:51:04.438 --> 01:51:12.103]  But we just had a black student on, a listener of the show, talking about his friend saying they saw two shooters, Darlin Martin.
[01:51:13.144 --> 01:51:14.304]  He's been listening for two years.
[01:51:14.885 --> 01:51:16.266]  He said he listens every day.
[01:51:17.153 --> 01:51:18.074]  And so do his friends.
[01:51:18.835 --> 01:51:19.776]  And that's why they're pissed.
[01:51:20.657 --> 01:51:21.898]  Because we got people everywhere.
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:26.302]  And you know, if Jalen saw something different, he'd tell us.
[01:51:26.322 --> 01:51:26.803]  But guess what?
[01:51:27.103 --> 01:51:28.665]  He saw just what everybody else saw.
[01:51:28.985 --> 01:51:32.028]  A white lady, a Hispanic lady, and a black man.
[01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:35.411]  Yeah, they're 17, 18 years old.
[01:51:35.431 --> 01:51:36.392]  They're ladies, they're men.
[01:51:36.633 --> 01:51:37.994]  Let's stop arresting their development.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.521]  And that's what they saw.
[01:51:42.201 --> 01:51:43.141]  That's what they witnessed.
[01:51:43.181 --> 01:51:45.042]  It isn't like they thought they heard shots over here.
[01:51:45.262 --> 01:51:48.663]  They're standing in front of him and the shots are going off down the building.
[01:51:48.983 --> 01:51:50.443]  That's sensational!
[01:51:52.604 --> 01:51:54.684]  And it lets you know what they're trying to launch right now.
[01:51:54.704 --> 01:51:56.065]  And I want to go to a clip from Matt Bracken.
[01:51:56.705 --> 01:51:58.725]  And he's joining us live in the Roger Stonestudio.
[01:52:02.788 --> 01:52:04.248]  Major guests are set to join us as well.
[01:52:04.348 --> 01:52:08.209]  The highest levels of the government in Florida, but I'll leave it right there.
[01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:12.871]  Just briefly, because I'm not going to spend much time on this, though, we need the funding.
[01:52:13.471 --> 01:52:15.691]  We got a bunch of incredible nutraceuticals and supplements.
[01:52:15.711 --> 01:52:16.792]  I'm going to explain it to you this way.
[01:52:17.672 --> 01:52:25.634]  Our fluoride-free, organic, concentrated toothpaste has, on average, sometimes it's 250, sometimes it's 320.
[01:52:28.516 --> 01:52:36.400]  Product, depending on the run we do, it has multiple dollars more of product in it than other toothpaste brands.
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.721]  Because it doesn't have fillers, it's concentrated.
[01:52:39.122 --> 01:52:40.022]  And people notice that.
[01:52:41.143 --> 01:52:48.326]  And it's the same thing when you get something like our Cell Force, it's gonna be called DNA Force Plus, more CoQ10, more BioPQQ, way below any price you'll ever find.
[01:52:48.366 --> 01:52:49.087]  It's an incredible deal.
[01:52:49.107 --> 01:52:53.309]  Because the other competitors mark it up three, four, five, six, seven times is the average.
[01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:54.990]  We mark it up 100% when we discount less.
[01:52:58.123 --> 01:53:08.549]  You get Icarin, our kidney and liver known detoxifier formula for $19.95, there's over $10 a product in that baby.
[01:53:12.571 --> 01:53:13.592]  Nobody does that.
[01:53:13.692 --> 01:53:18.474]  They do all the marketing, all the crud, and then put the worst, lowest level.
[01:53:18.794 --> 01:53:26.639]  Take our body's ultimate turmeric formula with 400 plus milligrams of turmeric in it, and they test it on the scale.
[01:53:28.136 --> 01:53:34.218]  Of turmeric, the curcumin scale, and it's 95% curcumin.
[01:53:36.319 --> 01:53:37.579]  The leading competitors are 3%.
[01:53:37.999 --> 01:53:41.120]  You understand?
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:42.741]  And we sell it for less!
[01:53:43.241 --> 01:53:46.102]  Because I'm a very superstitious man.
[01:53:47.082 --> 01:53:49.663]  I treat you exactly how I want to be treated.
[01:53:52.034 --> 01:53:54.596]  And that I use our products.
[01:53:54.816 --> 01:54:00.840]  I set out to make them the very best and with the top researchers and it's 50% off right now.
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.741]  It's all there, but it's about to end.
[01:54:02.841 --> 01:54:06.804]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:54:06.844 --> 01:54:10.767]  And I'm not bitching when I tell you they're coming after us behind the scenes.
[01:54:11.167 --> 01:54:12.948]  I'll be able to talk about it soon, but that's okay.
[01:54:12.988 --> 01:54:15.930]  I expect to draw enemy fire, but we need your financial support.
[01:54:15.970 --> 01:54:17.191]  Plus you need these products.
[01:54:17.471 --> 01:54:20.293]  It's a 360 total non-zero sum game.
[01:54:20.593 --> 01:54:21.314]  Absolute win.
[01:54:22.214 --> 01:54:28.459]  An infinity win, and you cannot lose except by not getting the products and not supporting the transmission.
[01:54:28.859 --> 01:54:31.021]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[01:54:31.301 --> 01:54:33.323]  Buy your war bonds, get great products while you're at it.
[01:54:33.623 --> 01:54:34.664]  Invest in your body's health.
[01:54:34.984 --> 01:54:36.765]  T-shirts, books, films, start of the month.
[01:54:37.086 --> 01:54:37.886]  Check it all out.
[01:54:37.986 --> 01:54:39.167]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:40.348 --> 01:54:41.409]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:54:41.609 --> 01:54:42.570]  Next year's news today.
[01:54:43.811 --> 01:54:45.272]  Changing the world today.
[01:54:46.772 --> 01:54:49.615]  And the shockwaves you and I send together are unbelievable.
[01:54:50.015 --> 01:54:55.961]  Coming up, though, the FBI was warned about a school shooting threat from a YouTube user named Nicholas Cruz in September.
[01:54:55.981 --> 01:54:57.702]  And that's all over the news.
[01:54:57.762 --> 01:54:58.883]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:54:58.924 --> 01:54:59.985]  It's on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:55:00.385 --> 01:55:05.850]  But they attacked Trump last night, before it was already in the news as well, that everybody had been warning, when he said, my God, they all warned.
[01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:07.151]  And the media said, oh.
[01:55:08.357 --> 01:55:09.378]  You're attacking the victims.
[01:55:09.398 --> 01:55:10.158]  That's not what he did.
[01:55:10.198 --> 01:55:23.824]  He said every time we get warned and nothing's done because he's being protected by the leftist elements of the FBI and profiled and picked up by one of the training centers they now admit out there run by one of these ne'er-do-well white supremacists.
[01:55:24.125 --> 01:55:26.946]  You want to find a Southern Poverty Law Center or ADL operative?
[01:55:26.966 --> 01:55:30.848]  I don't know about this particular ne'er-do-well, but in almost other cases I've looked at, it takes them.
[01:55:31.926 --> 01:55:34.027]  You talk about scum of the earth, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:34.067 --> 01:55:35.388]  Good God, the entire race.
[01:55:36.129 --> 01:55:39.351]  Cottage industries run by filth across the board, and it makes me sick.
[01:55:40.452 --> 01:55:41.692]  Let's go ahead and go to Matt Bracken.
[01:55:41.872 --> 01:55:42.313]  Stay with us.
[01:55:43.494 --> 01:55:45.995]  Yeah, so very Balkanized, like Lebanon.
[01:55:46.035 --> 01:55:48.437]  So I would expect to see more James Hodgkinsons.
[01:55:49.128 --> 01:56:02.618]  My bigger fear, though, is a false flag attack, specifically a Las Vegas-style sniper attack, but with a better plan to leave false clues that it was done by the right wing.
[01:56:03.158 --> 01:56:05.039]  This has been seen throughout history.
[01:56:05.099 --> 01:56:12.865]  I mean, in the Balkans we saw, in the Bosnia war, we saw mortar attacks, own-goal mortar attacks, that were successfully used.
[01:56:13.565 --> 01:56:16.067]  We've seen that also with the white helmets in Syria.
[01:56:17.848 --> 01:56:24.210]  And now we've got Pelosi and we've got other operatives who are known intelligence operatives of Deep State going on MSNBC and saying
[01:56:38.815 --> 01:56:41.217]  You're going to cause a massacre with these memos.
[01:56:41.517 --> 01:56:43.219]  You're going to cause a new Oklahoma City.
[01:56:43.839 --> 01:56:46.301]  And you've got all these other globalists saying that.
[01:56:46.341 --> 01:56:49.304]  They're signaling so they can go, oh look, see, we told you so.
[01:56:51.738 --> 01:56:56.523]  You know, Watergate style, this is all coming out, only it'll be, you know, 100 times bigger than Watergate.
[01:56:56.543 --> 01:57:02.669]  This is the entire FBI, DOJ, top echelon of the CIA under Brennan.
[01:57:03.811 --> 01:57:10.838]  There's some white hats, like Admiral Mike Rogers of NSA, that have kept us from completely going down the false narrative.
[01:57:11.644 --> 01:57:16.928]  But I think that the deep state traders, they see that their ship is sinking.
[01:57:16.948 --> 01:57:17.188]  Exactly.
[01:57:17.208 --> 01:57:20.910]  They're kind of on the Titanic, and they want to get on a lifeboat.
[01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:38.081]  So I think that the risk is much greater for a massive Oklahoma City-style false flag, or I'm not saying that Oklahoma City was necessarily a false flag, but there will be either something on a level of an Oklahoma City or a Las Vegas shooting where the literature will be left at the scene.
[01:57:38.482 --> 01:57:39.722]  You know, I hate the...
[01:57:41.044 --> 01:57:42.828]  I hate the left kind of literature.
[01:57:42.848 --> 01:57:43.570]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:43.630 --> 01:57:44.692]  And now that just happened.
[01:57:44.732 --> 01:57:47.960]  It's being reported that he was a white supremacist doing paramilitary training.
[01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:49.423]  So they can blame all gun owners.
[01:57:49.483 --> 01:57:49.884]  Stay with us.
[01:57:51.215 --> 01:58:02.742]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[01:58:02.782 --> 01:58:03.743]  We're exposed to lead.
[01:58:03.783 --> 01:58:04.804]  We're exposed to mercury.
[01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:09.827]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[01:58:10.227 --> 01:58:15.230]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:17.452]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[01:58:18.252 --> 01:58:19.633]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[01:58:19.753 --> 01:58:23.374]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[01:58:23.474 --> 01:58:28.477]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[01:58:28.837 --> 01:58:34.319]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:39.902]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[01:58:40.262 --> 01:58:41.223]  And over and over again.
[01:58:41.283 --> 01:58:48.166]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[01:58:48.386 --> 01:58:50.608]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[01:58:50.748 --> 01:58:52.248]  I mean, this is so massive.
[01:58:52.328 --> 01:59:05.636]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland.
[01:59:05.656 --> 01:59:06.316]  Fertility is key.
[01:59:06.836 --> 01:59:23.422]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually, the whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[01:59:23.822 --> 01:59:27.824]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[01:59:27.864 --> 01:59:31.405]  And you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill, and you take him off, it's like you're flying.
[01:59:31.885 --> 01:59:33.266]  All of a sudden, it was like, boom!
[01:59:33.766 --> 01:59:35.527]  Started losing weight, all this energy.
[01:59:35.547 --> 01:59:37.947]  I guess the iodine was sucking garbage out.
[01:59:38.268 --> 01:59:42.729]  It's as important as vitamin C. You gotta have vitamin C. You gotta have iodine to live.
[01:59:42.749 --> 01:59:43.769]  You gotta have water to live.
[01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:47.451]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.

[01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:57.654]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:58.174 --> 01:59:59.435]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.724 --> 02:00:23.961]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.227 --> 02:00:36.827]  All right, folks.
[02:00:36.867 --> 02:00:38.668]  Matt Bracken's coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:38.708 --> 02:00:39.889]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.929 --> 02:00:40.890]  Matt was on Friday.
[02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:45.492]  He and I just hammered the point, and I'm glad to show Matt's predictions.
[02:00:45.512 --> 02:00:46.453]  That's what I said, pull-ups.
[02:00:46.493 --> 02:00:47.693]  I remember him talking about it Friday.
[02:00:47.713 --> 02:00:56.018]  We can also get my clips where I said Friday, I think they'll shoot up schools or churches because that's their favorite target.
[02:00:57.216 --> 02:01:04.301]  And again, they get a mental patient, they take him to one of their little leftist cutout centers, an Elohim City type compound.
[02:01:04.321 --> 02:01:17.591]  This is exactly, I've probably said 300 times the last couple years, that they'll attack a school with a mental patient type individual with a cutout from some leftist right-wing training camp that's run by
[02:01:18.612 --> 02:01:27.640]  The Ford Foundation funded Southern Poverty Law Center, who's got hundreds of millions of offshore bank accounts and is connected to the Communist Chinese and others.
[02:01:29.501 --> 02:01:31.923]  By the way, the word is they're looking at leaving the U.S.
[02:01:31.983 --> 02:01:32.904]  and fighting the U.S.
[02:01:32.924 --> 02:01:33.725]  from overseas.
[02:01:34.946 --> 02:01:37.708]  They have nothing to do with helping black folks vote in Alabama.
[02:01:39.009 --> 02:01:41.331]  So, truly unbelievable.
[02:01:42.272 --> 02:01:43.473]  I am speechless at this point.
[02:01:44.625 --> 02:01:46.666]  That Matt Bracken is going to be coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:47.326 --> 02:01:53.368]  I wanted to play, just because it's so important, Pence is absolutely right that the entire Kim Jong-un family is incredibly evil.
[02:01:53.968 --> 02:01:56.869]  And our media siding with him and praising him is truly twisted.
[02:01:58.230 --> 02:02:02.711]  And Pence said, I ignored the dictator's sister that our media played up like she was some goddess.
[02:02:03.152 --> 02:02:03.872]  So here's that clip.
[02:02:03.912 --> 02:02:09.714]  Pence blasts evil Kim family, North Korea regime, to the chagrin of our own globalist media.
[02:02:10.234 --> 02:02:13.655]  That just like North Korea is part of a foreign parasitic power.
[02:02:13.876 --> 02:02:16.277]  Here is that report and we'll come back with Matt Bracken live.
[02:02:17.217 --> 02:02:21.499]  North Korea is the most tyrannical and oppressive regime on the planet.
[02:02:22.999 --> 02:02:30.522]  As the United Nations has documented repeatedly, North Korea is a nation that oppresses its people.
[02:02:31.423 --> 02:02:35.745]  Seven out of ten North Koreans require food assistance just to survive.
[02:02:36.625 --> 02:02:38.446]  Over a million North Koreans were let
[02:02:39.286 --> 02:02:39.927]  We're good to go.
[02:02:56.629 --> 02:03:00.694]  North Korea is today nothing short of a prison state.
[02:03:01.475 --> 02:03:02.456]  That's the reality.
[02:03:03.336 --> 02:03:14.248]  And so the fact that North Korea is developing and pursuing nuclear weapons that could be delivered on ballistic missiles to the continental United States.
[02:03:15.836 --> 02:03:17.337]  It's completely unacceptable.
[02:03:18.078 --> 02:03:40.572]  And the fixed policy of the United States of America is that we are going to continue, with all options on the table, to bring intensifying economic and diplomatic pressure to bear until North Korea, once and for all, completely and verifiably, abandons its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program.
[02:03:41.793 --> 02:03:44.275]  That's the fixed policy of the United States of America.
[02:03:45.276 --> 02:03:51.602]  Now, as President Trump has said many times, he said, I always believe in talking.
[02:03:52.863 --> 02:04:04.053]  And we've made it very clear that we're open to communicating our policy to the regime in North Korea.
[02:04:04.693 --> 02:04:06.315]  But what North Korea needs to understand
[02:04:07.216 --> 02:04:36.115]  And as I made clear in an announcement in Japan, when we announced a new round of sanctions that will be imposed, the largest ever sanctions imposed by the United States and we're confident our allies will join us on it in the days ahead, that nothing will change until the day comes that North Korea permanently abandons its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and ceases to threaten the United States of America.
[02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:36.516]  That's right.
[02:04:37.677 --> 02:04:41.781]  And be used as a pawn by the Communist Chinese and others to menace the entire region.
[02:04:42.321 --> 02:04:44.423]  It's a total power play for the South China Sea.
[02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:45.545]  We'll be back.
[02:04:45.685 --> 02:04:49.309]  By the way, he's the Patsy and more and more that's clear what he is.
[02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:52.812]  Nick Cruz has just now shown up in court.
[02:04:52.832 --> 02:04:54.774]  We'll have that live for you in one minute.
[02:04:54.794 --> 02:04:55.275]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.401 --> 02:05:11.430]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:11.490 --> 02:05:19.618]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:19.898 --> 02:05:24.600]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:05:24.781 --> 02:05:31.484]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:31.564 --> 02:05:38.647]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:05:38.748 --> 02:05:45.611]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:50.113]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:06:24.423 --> 02:06:29.366]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.127 --> 02:06:41.492]  All right, let's go to what's happening as we speak in Broward County, just north of Miami there, with the 17-plus dead, with Nicholas Cruz talking before the judge.
[02:06:41.532 --> 02:06:41.932]  Here it is.
[02:06:42.393 --> 02:06:43.913]  How would you like to proceed today?
[02:06:44.013 --> 02:06:49.316]  Are you seeking to hold the defendant no bond and a finding of proof-evident presumption break?
[02:06:49.376 --> 02:06:50.497]  Yes, Your Honor.
[02:06:51.801 --> 02:06:53.042]  Okay, you may proceed.
[02:06:53.062 --> 02:07:20.613]  Your Honor, the state's relying on the sworn affidavit that the court has been provided as to the 17 counts of first-degree murder and the contents of the sworn affidavit by detectives citing the actions of the defendant in going to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14th, 2018 with a premeditated design in that he went loaded with an AR-15 rifle.
[02:07:20.693 --> 02:07:21.033]  He had
[02:07:21.493 --> 02:07:22.054]  Okay, it depends.
[02:07:39.569 --> 02:07:44.213]  Your Honor, the defense has no arguments at this time and will defer until further court proceedings.
[02:07:44.733 --> 02:07:53.941]  We would formally invoke Mr. Cruz's right to remain silent and that notification relates to any law enforcement agencies that are involved in this case, both at a state and federal level.
[02:07:54.734 --> 02:07:57.035]  Okay, I've reviewed the probable cause affidavit.
[02:07:57.575 --> 02:08:00.616]  Mr. Cruz, filed in your case and I find probable cause.
[02:08:00.636 --> 02:08:03.858]  I further find the proof of guilt to be evident or the presumption great.
[02:08:04.398 --> 02:08:08.239]  Therefore, Mr. Cruz, you're going to be held without bond until further order of the court.
[02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:16.603]  This order is without prejudice for you to file a motion to set bond with your assigned division judge and request a hearing under State v. Arthur.
[02:08:16.663 --> 02:08:19.404]  Does anybody know, has he been assigned a division judge yet?
[02:08:20.501 --> 02:08:21.261]  Yes, he has, your honor.
[02:08:21.301 --> 02:08:22.522]  He's been assigned to Judge Shears.
[02:08:22.922 --> 02:08:23.722]  Okay, all right.
[02:08:23.822 --> 02:08:24.602]  Thank you very much.
[02:08:25.322 --> 02:08:26.703]  Sir, you're going to be held no bond.
[02:08:29.324 --> 02:08:36.146]  All right, folks, there you go.
[02:08:36.746 --> 02:08:41.107]  Nicholas Cruz shows up in court zombie-like.
[02:08:41.307 --> 02:08:43.908]  We have had multiple clips of eyewitnesses
[02:08:45.202 --> 02:09:03.376]  Who told local news and national news and Texas news, KPRC, KHOU, you name it, that there were multiple shooters, that they saw him without a gun while the shooting was going on, and KHOU said, this is big, we're gonna air it tonight, never aired it, but the reporter, Matt Muzzell, put it out.
[02:09:04.477 --> 02:09:04.677]  Then,
[02:09:06.223 --> 02:09:15.051]  We have more footage of KPRC with a very articulate high school senior, a Hispanic lady, but we don't know her name, I'm guessing she's a senior, saying she's a senior at the school.
[02:09:16.032 --> 02:09:25.701]  And they don't show it on the news, somebody shot an iPhone over the camera saying they trapped us both ends, drove us in, shot the teachers in the head, you name it.
[02:09:27.076 --> 02:09:39.603]  So the fact that, and I'm not saying the police were involved, it's a big bureaucracy, but they had drills there, they had Secret Service involved four weeks ago, I've had the witnesses on, we have guests on as well that are students that said that others said there were multiple shooters.
[02:09:42.139 --> 02:09:43.280]  Jalen Martin was on.
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:10:04.133]  So the fact that the news isn't running with this, and I already played it last hour, but when he posts this on Facebook and YouTube, we'll tag it on, two clips of Matt Bracken in an hour interview last week, I got into it as well, saying, new Oklahoma City, new school shooting, where they blame the right wing, and sure enough, this guy is at this very questionable white supremacist compound out in Florida.
[02:10:04.973 --> 02:10:11.857]  Training to break away and make Florida its own country, and the guy immediately comes out and says, I confirm, he paramilitarily trains with us.
[02:10:12.317 --> 02:10:13.498]  This is incredible.
[02:10:13.518 --> 02:10:19.241]  This is exactly the card we would expect to be played by the deep state at this time.
[02:10:19.281 --> 02:10:21.102]  It's what Matt Bracken predicted.
[02:10:21.122 --> 02:10:22.243]  It's what I've been predicting.
[02:10:22.283 --> 02:10:23.723]  It's all the globalists have left.
[02:10:24.124 --> 02:10:28.306]  So Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert, and bestselling author, researcher.
[02:10:29.166 --> 02:10:31.488]  This is exactly the move we would expect.
[02:10:32.428 --> 02:10:35.010]  And now we learned his family's gone dead recently.
[02:10:35.310 --> 02:10:36.491]  He's on psychotropics.
[02:10:36.851 --> 02:10:38.412]  He would do anything anybody asked.
[02:10:38.432 --> 02:10:39.793]  He was a total joke at the school.
[02:10:40.914 --> 02:10:41.874]  Autistic, clearly.
[02:10:42.535 --> 02:10:45.076]  This is the perfect cutout for this.
[02:10:47.018 --> 02:10:48.238]  I mean, what do you make of this?
[02:10:48.559 --> 02:10:50.040]  This is happening in real time.
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:50.860]  Matt Bracken.
[02:10:53.062 --> 02:10:59.706]  You know, we're still in the first barely more than 24 hours, so there's a lot of noise and false reports.
[02:11:01.273 --> 02:11:12.018]  Reports of multiple shooters, like the back at the Beltway Sniper, the white man in the white van, false reports can take on a life of their own.
[02:11:13.078 --> 02:11:25.864]  Echoes, things that are like in Las Vegas, multiple shooters from multiple positions, multiple buildings, often are a result of a cascade of police reports
[02:11:26.414 --> 02:11:29.555]  Coming over top of one another, being heard as separate incidents.
[02:11:29.575 --> 02:11:40.177]  Sure, but Vegas is now unraveled, and we're talking to witnesses, and we're airing witnesses that were with him while guns are going off, with Nicholas Cruz while they hear guns going off.
[02:11:40.217 --> 02:11:41.017]  That's pretty powerful.
[02:11:41.597 --> 02:11:45.598]  Well, what was he doing at the school if he was expelled last year on the day of the shooting?
[02:11:45.618 --> 02:11:51.379]  I'm not saying he's not a shooter, and I'm not saying it didn't happen, but I mean, this is exactly what you were predicting Friday.
[02:11:54.750 --> 02:11:58.106]  At this point, I have no reason to disbelieve that it's not his gun.
[02:12:00.291 --> 02:12:01.071]  His ammunition.
[02:12:01.091 --> 02:12:02.652]  Well, I want to be clear.
[02:12:02.712 --> 02:12:04.112]  I'm not saying he wasn't a shooter.
[02:12:04.152 --> 02:12:04.792]  We don't know.
[02:12:05.432 --> 02:12:09.533]  I'm just saying the timing of this, the eyewitnesses, these are very credible.
[02:12:09.553 --> 02:12:13.214]  This isn't like, you know, we're thinking multiple reports of shooters a year.
[02:12:13.234 --> 02:12:14.254]  There's multiple shooters.
[02:12:14.554 --> 02:12:15.454]  Those reports came in.
[02:12:15.754 --> 02:12:18.415]  We've got people saying they're talking to him while guns are going off.
[02:12:18.435 --> 02:12:20.075]  Have you seen those videos?
[02:12:20.095 --> 02:12:20.615]  Well, no.
[02:12:21.035 --> 02:12:23.376]  That's going to have to be sorted out, obviously.
[02:12:23.416 --> 02:12:28.377]  And it probably won't be if it doesn't suit a national narrative.
[02:12:29.379 --> 02:12:30.281]  A network narrative.
[02:12:30.361 --> 02:12:35.435]  But at this point, I tend to think
[02:12:36.508 --> 02:12:38.810]  Not necessarily are these things a conspiracy.
[02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:44.853]  A lot of times, like in Las Vegas, the cover-up is a result of police covering up incompetence.
[02:12:45.514 --> 02:12:56.401]  If, for example, the FBI had clear warnings about this guy last year, and it got dropped into the bureaucratic cracks, and no action was taken.
[02:12:56.581 --> 02:12:59.743]  By the way, as you said, that's confirmed.
[02:13:00.083 --> 02:13:01.364]  Not just the FBI was warned.
[02:13:01.384 --> 02:13:04.106]  People have been warned about this for a long time, this guy.
[02:13:06.032 --> 02:13:12.674]  I've never heard of emails going out through a school saying that so-and-so is not allowed on campus with a backpack.
[02:13:13.334 --> 02:13:19.196]  I mean, that's very creepy and makes you wonder what the writer of that email knew or had been told.
[02:13:20.496 --> 02:13:35.741]  The fact that there was no home check on this guy after his father died when he was much younger, his mother died three months ago, so he's clearly skating on thin ice psychologically.
[02:13:36.425 --> 02:13:42.629]  If he's changing his meds or stopping his meds, that can cause a very abrupt change in behavior.
[02:13:42.829 --> 02:13:47.132]  Well, he looks like a textbook lunatic to me, so I'm not saying he isn't one of the shooters.
[02:13:47.652 --> 02:13:49.873]  I'm just saying we have to look at all these credible people.
[02:13:49.893 --> 02:13:52.034]  I don't know if you've seen those videos, Matt.
[02:13:52.435 --> 02:14:00.079]  Just the whole timing of this just screams that we need to investigate, that this was at least known about and protected and wound up for the political.
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:03.421]  They're calling for gun control, they're blaming all gun owners, they're blaming Trump.
[02:14:03.501 --> 02:14:05.943]  I mean, this is a real godsend right now to the left.
[02:14:06.670 --> 02:14:11.516]  Yeah, I can see Trump throwing AR-15s on the table as a bargaining chip.
[02:14:12.377 --> 02:14:15.361]  He's never been really a committed Second Amendment guy.
[02:14:15.381 --> 02:14:20.688]  I can see him being a New Yorker saying, well, maybe we need to do something about AR-15s.
[02:14:20.788 --> 02:14:23.992]  Of course, what they're not going to say
[02:14:24.733 --> 02:14:30.877]  Socially, this could have happened in 1910, because that's how long we've had semi-automatic rifles.
[02:14:31.798 --> 02:14:35.100]  Yeah, we have mentally ill people, and CNN says mass shootings are up.
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:37.602]  They're flat for 30 years, so that's a lie.
[02:14:37.642 --> 02:14:39.743]  They hype these, it's serious, it's a problem.
[02:14:40.124 --> 02:14:43.346]  But we need guns to protect ourselves from lunatics like this.
[02:14:44.608 --> 02:14:52.195]  Or from the government, if it comes to, you know, that type of a tyrannical push by, you know, the government.
[02:14:52.235 --> 02:15:01.463]  If they, for example, if they manage to push Trump out with this phony Russian narrative, you know, it could come to some kind of a civil war.
[02:15:02.063 --> 02:15:07.468]  And anybody that's served in the military knows there's basically two kinds of human beings.
[02:15:08.243 --> 02:15:11.833]  Armed aggressors and disarmed victims.
[02:15:12.475 --> 02:15:16.565]  And if you don't want to be a disarmed victim, you at least have to be an armed defender.
[02:15:17.370 --> 02:15:20.811]  And that doesn't mean, you know, a double-barreled shotgun.
[02:15:21.331 --> 02:15:24.493]  That means something that's the equivalent of what the police can bring to bear.
[02:15:24.773 --> 02:15:30.175]  And that's why the UN and the globalists want the semi-automatic battle rifles so that America's defenseless.
[02:15:30.195 --> 02:15:30.715]  They admit that.
[02:15:30.735 --> 02:15:34.796]  They say civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[02:15:34.836 --> 02:15:35.456]  That's UNIDIR.
[02:15:35.797 --> 02:15:36.397]  That's the UN.
[02:15:36.417 --> 02:15:38.538]  They say they want a monopoly of force over you.
[02:15:39.018 --> 02:15:39.718]  Matt, stay there.
[02:15:39.758 --> 02:15:41.559]  We've got Roger Stone coming in to give his take.
[02:15:41.619 --> 02:15:42.059]  I want to ask,
[02:15:42.979 --> 02:15:44.762]  The big assault of the Second Amendment's here.
[02:15:45.222 --> 02:15:46.904]  We've been so confident we can defend it.
[02:15:47.265 --> 02:15:47.986]  I've warned people.
[02:15:48.026 --> 02:15:48.967]  They're planning stuff.
[02:15:49.748 --> 02:15:53.573]  And they are certainly going to use this to blame all gun owners and blame the Second Amendment.
[02:15:53.613 --> 02:15:55.435]  That's really the confirmed false flag here.
[02:15:55.816 --> 02:15:56.436]  We'll be back.
[02:15:56.537 --> 02:15:58.459]  I'm Alex Jones at NewsWarriors.com.
[02:15:58.779 --> 02:15:59.841]  NewsWarriors.com.
[02:15:59.861 --> 02:16:00.422]  Spread that link.
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:05.983]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globals, but they're striking back all over the world.
[02:16:06.263 --> 02:16:11.807]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[02:16:11.907 --> 02:16:20.933]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[02:16:21.113 --> 02:16:28.938]  So go to fortifiedsupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[02:16:29.039 --> 02:16:30.700]  That's fortifiedsupply.com.
[02:16:33.882 --> 02:16:38.646]  Now, joining us is a best-selling author and researcher, Michael Malice.
[02:16:39.567 --> 02:16:40.568]  MichaelMalice.com.
[02:16:40.588 --> 02:16:44.211]  He grew up behind the Iron Curtain, so he understands the tyranny of collectivism.
[02:16:44.231 --> 02:16:45.812]  He's at Twitter, at Michael Malice.
[02:16:45.892 --> 02:16:50.456]  He's written Dear Reader, Kim Jong-il, and he's been over there and researched it.
[02:16:50.476 --> 02:16:54.580]  So again, Michael Malice, author of The Dear Reader, about North Korea.
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:58.623]  Give us your expert take on where we are right now and the chances for war over there.
[02:16:58.983 --> 02:17:00.524]  I talk about this heavily in my book.
[02:17:00.664 --> 02:17:04.147]  If you look at these countries, Libya is a great example.
[02:17:04.607 --> 02:17:06.749]  Iraq and several others.
[02:17:06.909 --> 02:17:12.233]  When the countries liberalized, Romania was the example Kim Jong Il himself used.
[02:17:12.613 --> 02:17:16.095]  When these countries liberalize, very often the people at the top are shot.
[02:17:16.596 --> 02:17:17.476]  And with good reason.
[02:17:17.536 --> 02:17:19.638]  You look at Gaddafi, he was sodomized to death.
[02:17:19.938 --> 02:17:21.199]  Saddam Hussein was hung.
[02:17:21.559 --> 02:17:24.381]  And Libya had a nascent nuclear program.
[02:17:24.741 --> 02:17:25.982]  They agreed to give it up.
[02:17:26.062 --> 02:17:28.184]  And what happened is, right now you have slavery there.
[02:17:28.624 --> 02:17:32.986]  So North Korea very quickly realized that the best defense is a good offense.
[02:17:33.546 --> 02:17:39.869]  Kim Jong Il said he wants to turn the country into a hedgehog, meaning one with nuclear missile spines pointing in every direction.
[02:17:40.289 --> 02:17:42.390]  And if you think about it, how much easier?
[02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:48.173]  I don't think they would have been running their mouths to this point if they didn't have nukes or at least some very, very strong weaponry.
[02:17:48.613 --> 02:17:49.774]  Something would have happened to him.
[02:17:49.854 --> 02:17:52.896]  So they are very conniving in their hold on power.
[02:17:53.216 --> 02:17:56.358]  They're very interested in self-preservation.
[02:17:56.658 --> 02:18:04.803]  And unfortunately, it's at the expense of the, you know, 25 million North Korean population who are the victims in this horrible decades-long atrocity.
[02:18:05.263 --> 02:18:14.889]  Don't they know the calculus has changed and that the whole strategy of patience and then the globalists using North Korea as a strategy of tension, that that is coming to an end?
[02:18:15.069 --> 02:18:17.211]  It is coming to an end, and they're scared.
[02:18:17.311 --> 02:18:21.414]  And they're clearly scared, and you see that they're reaching out to South Korea, their arch-rival.
[02:18:21.914 --> 02:18:27.599]  It's some kind of... China very publicly last year, and in recent months, has been turning their backs on them.
[02:18:27.939 --> 02:18:30.121]  Russia, to some extent, has been turning their backs on them.
[02:18:30.141 --> 02:18:35.665]  You know, Putin liked the idea that North Korea could kind of be a thorn in our side, but even he's not going to be defending.
[02:18:35.965 --> 02:18:36.165]  I think?
[02:18:56.753 --> 02:19:00.315]  Every country is turning their back on the North, and they don't know what to do.
[02:19:00.355 --> 02:19:02.976]  This is kind of uncharted territory for them, thank God.
[02:19:03.036 --> 02:19:09.979]  And I'm not saying this is the end of the North Korean regime, which I pray every day that it is, but if this were the end, this is what the end would look like.
[02:19:10.239 --> 02:19:18.803]  They are a hostage nation of just people who don't even know what planet they're on, and that's why they're the greatest victims, people under communism.
[02:19:18.823 --> 02:19:21.405]  Michael Malice, the book, Dear Reader, available everywhere.
[02:19:21.425 --> 02:19:23.005]  Twitter, Michael Malice.
[02:19:23.245 --> 02:19:24.386]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:19:24.426 --> 02:19:25.066]  I appreciate you.
[02:19:25.707 --> 02:19:26.247]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:19:31.678 --> 02:19:38.904]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:19:39.384 --> 02:19:48.531]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[02:19:48.811 --> 02:19:53.915]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[02:19:54.195 --> 02:19:57.057]  It also funds the InfoWar, a total 360 win.
[02:19:57.458 --> 02:20:00.080]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:20:05.224 --> 02:20:07.833]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:28.522 --> 02:20:30.743]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:31.183 --> 02:20:36.406]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:38.227 --> 02:20:45.150]  So, where this took place is about 40 minutes north, or about 40 miles north of Miami.
[02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:46.811]  And just north of that is Mar-a-Lago.
[02:20:47.211 --> 02:20:49.112]  The president was scheduled to be speaking near there.
[02:20:49.152 --> 02:20:51.653]  He's now canceled that trip after the shooting.
[02:20:53.400 --> 02:21:01.962]  We're looking at this, and all I know is we have three witnesses that are students that credibly say not they heard shots or heard there were two shooters.
[02:21:02.402 --> 02:21:09.523]  A couple of them are talking to, you know, talking to the supposed shooter while the gunshots are going off.
[02:21:10.584 --> 02:21:12.184]  This is just beyond bizarre.
[02:21:12.204 --> 02:21:17.105]  But all I'm saying, Roger, to you, Matt Bracken via Skype, counterterrorism expert, former Navy SEAL,
[02:21:18.734 --> 02:21:22.756]  We can put the map I was looking at during break up on screen from Google Maps if we can.
[02:21:24.957 --> 02:21:26.997]  Geographically, how does this feed into this?
[02:21:27.658 --> 02:21:30.439]  First look, the left's already blaming all gun owners.
[02:21:32.039 --> 02:21:33.360]  We're collectively bad.
[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:36.701]  Even though this is an example to own guns to protect yourself.
[02:21:37.582 --> 02:21:40.583]  Salon, MSNBC, CNN, they all blamed.
[02:21:41.463 --> 02:21:51.145]  Trump saying he blamed the victims when he said the victims warned, now the FBI has been confirmed, have been specifically warned of him planning a mass shooting event.
[02:21:51.485 --> 02:21:52.786]  So I'm not saying he's not a shooter.
[02:21:52.826 --> 02:21:53.546]  I'm not saying that.
[02:21:53.686 --> 02:22:08.109]  I'm saying this thing and the political connections of him training at some weird, you know, white supremacist compound in Florida, what in my experience, I mean like 80% of those things are run by Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, Ford Foundation, the left.
[02:22:08.929 --> 02:22:13.251]  He's been caught over and over again running a lot of the white supremacist groups for PR purposes.
[02:22:13.611 --> 02:22:16.272]  And infiltrating them so they can then manipulate them.
[02:22:16.312 --> 02:22:20.834]  Look, if there's a headline here, Alex, the headline is, FBI screws up again.
[02:22:20.854 --> 02:22:38.080]  I mean, if the President needed more evidence that he needs to clean house at the FBI, starting with Chris Christie's nominee as FBI Director, Mr. Wray, who was only a week ago fighting the release of the Devin Nunes memo exposing the misdeeds of the FBI.
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:41.922]  They said it would cause a massacre like Oklahoma City if we released it.
[02:22:41.982 --> 02:22:42.643]  That's right.
[02:22:42.843 --> 02:22:44.364]  We need a house cleaning at the FBI.
[02:22:44.384 --> 02:22:48.386]  We need to restore that agency's reputation for integrity.
[02:22:48.707 --> 02:22:49.687]  It's been rotted away.
[02:22:49.707 --> 02:22:51.588]  It's been corroded by politics.
[02:22:51.889 --> 02:22:58.773]  That's the biggest story here because this, apparently, could have been prevented if the FBI was doing its job.
[02:22:58.993 --> 02:23:02.295]  Well, Matt Braggin predicted this last Friday that it'd be a false flag.
[02:23:02.375 --> 02:23:05.477]  And he's saying, no, I don't want to say that at this point, which I totally agree.
[02:23:05.617 --> 02:23:06.698]  We're just looking at every angle.
[02:23:06.998 --> 02:23:08.279]  The media will misrepresent what we said.
[02:23:08.759 --> 02:23:15.224]  But regardless, the FBI got warned by the school, by other students, YouTube threats.
[02:23:15.304 --> 02:23:17.986]  I mean, this is ridiculous, but it's kind of like...
[02:23:18.806 --> 02:23:24.467]  Phil Mudd, formerly of the CIA and FBI, go on TV and say we're going to kill the President, and then do all this fake crying we'll cover next segment.
[02:23:25.668 --> 02:23:27.488]  And all these leftist groups saying go kill cops.
[02:23:28.028 --> 02:23:30.309]  If I said kill cops, I should get arrested.
[02:23:30.349 --> 02:23:33.730]  And by the way, we've had listeners threatened and the Secret Service shows up.
[02:23:34.250 --> 02:23:40.792]  So if you're a conservative, a Christian, a libertarian, pro-military, pro-America, you don't call for violence, you get Secret Service visits.
[02:23:41.072 --> 02:23:44.073]  But if you're openly calling for a violent revolution, you don't.
[02:23:44.253 --> 02:23:45.633]  What do you make of that, Matt Bracken?
[02:23:47.185 --> 02:23:52.968]  Well, we're still in the non-shooting phase of the Civil War, and right now it's playing out in the military.
[02:23:53.049 --> 02:24:07.237]  Not only guys like Phil Mudd, you know, a former intelligence analyst, not a CIA officer, you know, field agent type, but just, you know, an office wonk analyst.
[02:24:07.257 --> 02:24:13.761]  Not a patriot, not an actual killer for liberty, but another little wimp that would give the orders.
[02:24:14.517 --> 02:24:18.800]  But they've also put it, this is like Project Mockingbird, but right in the open.
[02:24:19.261 --> 02:24:21.502]  The FBI's put a stooge at CNN.
[02:24:22.543 --> 02:24:26.106]  Mike Morrell, he's a former CIA assistant director.
[02:24:26.146 --> 02:24:29.709]  He helped, you know, he was definitely a deep state operative.
[02:24:30.169 --> 02:24:32.291]  Reid Atkinson's book, Stonewalled.
[02:24:32.771 --> 02:24:35.534]  But Morrell's at CBS as a commentator.
[02:24:35.954 --> 02:24:39.077]  So they're putting the Mockingbird stuff straight out in the open.
[02:24:39.538 --> 02:24:42.520]  And that's when you know it's an agenda and probably staged.
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:43.761]  They've got their talking points ready.
[02:24:44.082 --> 02:24:45.603]  So regardless, they're moving.
[02:24:45.643 --> 02:24:47.025]  Matt Bracken, then Roger Stone.
[02:24:47.525 --> 02:24:50.508]  The narrative's get our guns, Trump's evil, everything's his fault.
[02:24:50.768 --> 02:24:51.769]  Where are they going to go with this?
[02:24:51.789 --> 02:24:53.771]  Because they're clearly lined up to go completely ape.
[02:24:54.733 --> 02:25:01.464]  Well, anybody that defends owning an AR-15 is going to be portrayed as a pro-massacre person.
[02:25:01.484 --> 02:25:07.775]  The solution to this, there's two solutions to these kind of shootings that probably won't ever happen.
[02:25:08.502 --> 02:25:10.664]  Uh, except in local jurisdictions.
[02:25:11.185 --> 02:25:15.989]  One is arming teachers that are, for example, military combat veteran.
[02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:23.837]  We have tons and tons of teachers today that served from Desert Storm through Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Afghanistan.
[02:25:23.857 --> 02:25:29.623]  This coach that rushed, even reportedly saved a bunch of kids, or rushed the shooter in the gas mask who got shot.
[02:25:29.703 --> 02:25:31.785]  Why does somebody like that have a concealed carry?
[02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.589]  Right.
[02:25:32.649 --> 02:25:41.872]  He actually put the barrels, according to reports, he shot through the window of a classroom door and fired through the door.
[02:25:42.733 --> 02:25:53.557]  If there are a percentage of teachers that have a pistol in a lockbox, you know, one of these finger combinations that you retrieve in a few seconds, then this will be curtailed greatly.
[02:25:53.597 --> 02:25:54.137]  Exactly.
[02:25:54.337 --> 02:25:57.058]  The other thing, though, is the glorification of these guys.
[02:25:58.010 --> 02:26:01.531]  The exception today is this guy died and apparently tried to get away.
[02:26:01.851 --> 02:26:06.512]  Who knows if he thought he was, you know, meeting his contact, you know, whoever that might be.
[02:26:06.952 --> 02:26:11.393]  He thought he was going to be part of an extraction plan and instead it was an arrest plan.
[02:26:11.853 --> 02:26:26.097]  But, you know, the exception was that he didn't shoot himself, which tells me right away this isn't the typical Columbine or, you know, the typical shooter that... Are you saying this points towards handlers that he thought he was going to get extracted?
[02:26:27.267 --> 02:26:30.330]  Well, it's just an odd twist.
[02:26:30.510 --> 02:26:31.350]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:26:31.751 --> 02:26:33.972]  It doesn't fit the regular pattern.
[02:26:34.693 --> 02:26:35.254]  It does not.
[02:26:35.394 --> 02:26:41.018]  And if you want these things to stop, the other thing is to do we have to stop showing these guys faces and names.
[02:26:41.599 --> 02:26:44.061]  He should be known after the first, say, 24 hours.
[02:26:44.141 --> 02:26:44.901]  It's a news story.
[02:26:44.981 --> 02:26:45.402]  I get it.
[02:26:46.182 --> 02:26:47.604]  And whether they're alive or dead.
[02:26:48.004 --> 02:26:48.704]  But I'll say this.
[02:26:48.744 --> 02:26:51.867]  He looked like a total zombie at that arraignment.
[02:26:53.568 --> 02:26:53.749]  Yes.
[02:26:54.693 --> 02:26:58.735]  It's like, experts can analyze him to study it for the lessons that are learned.
[02:26:59.155 --> 02:27:13.043]  But the more important thing is, he's, when the media shows his face and name over and over again, when he occupies the media spotlight for weeks, he is... It's gonna cause copycats.
[02:27:13.603 --> 02:27:18.006]  He should be called the Parkland Monster, and his face should be pixelated.
[02:27:18.746 --> 02:27:24.009]  So that there's only a negative connotation to this, that there's no glory.
[02:27:24.149 --> 02:27:30.992]  I want to go out in a blaze of glory like, you know, Dylan and Klebold, like Nicholas Cruz.
[02:27:31.492 --> 02:27:35.054]  It should be the Parkland Monster, the Columbine Monsters.
[02:27:35.654 --> 02:27:38.275]  And it should be a completely negative connotation.
[02:27:38.295 --> 02:27:43.078]  I mean, goodness knows, Rolling Stone, they put the Tsarnaev brother on the cover.
[02:27:43.698 --> 02:27:48.500]  You know, they glorify... Sure, they're always trying to do this because this is the culture they want.
[02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:50.840]  They have so much mental illness and so much bad stuff.
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:51.821]  We're all treated like criminals.
[02:27:52.141 --> 02:27:57.282]  And when Islamist runs over a bunch of people with a truck, they then blame, you know, all vehicle owners.
[02:27:57.342 --> 02:27:58.403]  It's the same psychology.
[02:27:58.783 --> 02:28:01.484]  All right, Matt Bracken, EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com.
[02:28:01.744 --> 02:28:02.884]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:28:03.764 --> 02:28:03.944]  Thanks.
[02:28:04.485 --> 02:28:05.765]  All right, we're going to break here, Roger.
[02:28:06.045 --> 02:28:06.425]  40 seconds.
[02:28:07.185 --> 02:28:08.606]  What do you think politically is coming out of this?
[02:28:09.571 --> 02:28:11.932]  Well, first of all, you can already see the meme.
[02:28:12.633 --> 02:28:17.495]  Blaming guns, blaming gun owners, blaming the Second Amendment, blaming mental illness.
[02:28:17.935 --> 02:28:20.136]  The Israelis have a much better take on this, Alex.
[02:28:20.436 --> 02:28:22.958]  This guy was planning this seven months in advance.
[02:28:23.518 --> 02:28:23.938]  Profile!
[02:28:24.418 --> 02:28:24.999]  Exactly.
[02:28:25.699 --> 02:28:32.082]  The real story... When you say, I'm going to be a mass shooter and kill people, you get your ass locked up and maybe a little electroshock.
[02:28:32.282 --> 02:28:33.763]  So, where was the FBI?
[02:28:33.803 --> 02:28:35.804]  That's really what I think we have to focus on.
[02:28:36.284 --> 02:28:37.785]  The more evidence we need of housecleaning.
[02:28:38.645 --> 02:28:42.369]  And sure, I'm not a violent guy, and I'm against sarcasm and electroshock.
[02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:44.792]  The point is, you say, I'm going to go out and start killing people.
[02:28:45.973 --> 02:28:47.855]  Well, people come over to your house and they break your ribs.
[02:28:48.015 --> 02:28:48.776]  I mean, you know.
[02:28:48.796 --> 02:28:52.319]  They certainly come and interrogate you, and they put you under surveillance.
[02:28:52.399 --> 02:28:54.902]  I'm sick of people running their mouths about violence all the time.
[02:28:55.843 --> 02:28:58.986]  You know, it just makes me sick.
[02:28:59.046 --> 02:28:59.586]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:59.606 --> 02:28:59.987]  Stay with us.
[02:29:01.491 --> 02:29:05.373]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:29:05.913 --> 02:29:13.318]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:29:14.018 --> 02:29:18.721]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:29:19.341 --> 02:29:21.242]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:29:21.862 --> 02:29:25.304]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:29:26.105 --> 02:29:28.566]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:29:29.244 --> 02:29:35.914]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:29:36.495 --> 02:29:43.725]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:29:44.586 --> 02:29:51.254]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:29:51.814 --> 02:29:52.916]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[02:32:07.901 --> 02:32:16.549]  You know, I found out they've got big publications going around trying to find people to lie and say that I don't believe what I say and that I don't like my audience.
[02:32:16.589 --> 02:32:16.690]  What?
[02:32:18.283 --> 02:32:19.763]  Again, don't believe what I say.
[02:32:19.844 --> 02:32:21.404]  We're building what we've talked about.
[02:32:21.444 --> 02:32:22.504]  We're turning it around.
[02:32:22.544 --> 02:32:23.405]  We're doing it.
[02:32:23.925 --> 02:32:25.445]  That's the proof of believing something.
[02:32:26.285 --> 02:32:28.326]  I'm 110% committed to this and you know it.
[02:32:28.746 --> 02:32:31.167]  And when you fund us, they can't stop us.
[02:32:31.707 --> 02:32:33.548]  We're starting to see the orders rolling in.
[02:32:33.588 --> 02:32:35.588]  People saying they're listening and watching on TV stations.
[02:32:35.728 --> 02:32:37.589]  So praise God, the cavalry's coming over.
[02:32:38.689 --> 02:32:39.370]  The reds here.
[02:32:39.930 --> 02:32:47.736]  And so for all the censorship online and the stuff they've done trying to destroy us, they're not suppressing the signal thanks to you out there.
[02:32:47.756 --> 02:32:48.837]  I want to thank God.
[02:32:48.857 --> 02:32:49.638]  I want to thank my family.
[02:32:49.658 --> 02:32:50.418]  I want to thank this crew.
[02:32:50.438 --> 02:32:51.819]  I want to thank the audience.
[02:32:52.480 --> 02:32:56.382]  Again, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:33:05.299 --> 02:33:07.922]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:26.095 --> 02:33:30.200]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:30.961 --> 02:33:39.872]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:33:44.013 --> 02:33:50.260]  Well, we've got Don Lemon up there saying that mass shootings are way up and that your chances of being killed by guns are up.
[02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:53.583]  Actually, gun crimes down close to 60% since 1993.
[02:33:54.123 --> 02:33:58.248]  And the FBI's own statistics say, well, who believes the FBI?
[02:33:58.388 --> 02:34:01.091]  Those are actual death statistics, crime statistics.
[02:34:01.131 --> 02:34:02.632]  The FBI pioneered.
[02:34:03.513 --> 02:34:03.753]  I think so.
[02:34:24.321 --> 02:34:40.587]  The former Deputy Director of Counterterrorism at the CIA, another pencil pusher, not an actual guy that took action, he says the government's going to kill the President, and he says that he's a proud know-what-holer, and these stunts, well his latest stunt,
[02:34:41.884 --> 02:34:44.845]  Uh, is on CNN last night with Wolf Blitzer.
[02:34:44.905 --> 02:34:46.306]  It is the worst acting I've ever seen.
[02:34:47.186 --> 02:34:55.030]  He talks about how he's battled ISIS when Obama and others that he helped with defended ISIS and launched the Arab Spring.
[02:34:55.510 --> 02:35:01.733]  Then he can't shed any tears so he turns his head to the side and does this fake crying, you know, I've got four children.
[02:35:02.273 --> 02:35:03.434]  And I've seen a few of them over the years.
[02:35:03.454 --> 02:35:03.894]  They're sweet.
[02:35:04.134 --> 02:35:05.575]  Girls especially try fake crime.
[02:35:06.156 --> 02:35:07.937]  This is really bad acting.
[02:35:08.858 --> 02:35:16.823]  So he's using the dead young people to blame all gun owners, project that onto all gun owners during these rants against the Second Amendment, Roger.
[02:35:16.843 --> 02:35:22.067]  And then I thought I would just cut then some of his other statements.
[02:35:22.087 --> 02:35:23.488]  So here's Phil Mudd.
[02:35:24.569 --> 02:35:26.550]  You're hearing these accounts.
[02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:29.673]  What's going through your mind as someone who used to work at the FBI?
[02:35:32.136 --> 02:35:33.417]  You think it's antiseptic.
[02:35:33.957 --> 02:35:34.438]  It's not.
[02:35:35.559 --> 02:35:41.323]  I talked to a terrorist who almost died because he wanted to blow up a weapon, a car bomb.
[02:35:42.044 --> 02:35:45.887]  And he was sent to blow up that car bomb by ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[02:35:46.627 --> 02:35:49.349]  And they didn't tell him he was going to blow up the car bomb.
[02:35:49.389 --> 02:35:52.031]  When he detonated, the car caught fire.
[02:35:52.452 --> 02:35:53.272]  It didn't blow up.
[02:35:53.352 --> 02:35:55.974]  And I talked to him after he lost a lot of his skins.
[02:35:56.875 --> 02:35:58.537]  His hands, his feet.
[02:35:59.177 --> 02:36:00.718]  I have ten nieces and nephews.
[02:36:00.758 --> 02:36:02.280]  We're talking about bump stocks.
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:04.442]  We're talking about legislation.
[02:36:04.462 --> 02:36:07.204]  A child of God is dead.
[02:36:08.305 --> 02:36:13.950]  Cannot we acknowledge in this country that we can't, we cannot accept this.
[02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:15.491]  I can't do a wolf.
[02:36:15.511 --> 02:36:16.232]  I'm sorry.
[02:36:16.532 --> 02:36:17.253]  We can't do it.
[02:36:19.904 --> 02:36:24.588]  Alright, we're going to get back to you, but you're, you're, you're obviously, this is so emotional.
[02:36:24.628 --> 02:36:26.129]  I'm a former government official.
[02:36:26.169 --> 02:36:27.350]  Government's going to kill this guy.
[02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:30.793]  Well, close your ears, Wolf, because I'm going to give you a reaction and it's personal.
[02:36:30.933 --> 02:36:32.154]  I'm a proud s*** bowler.
[02:36:33.435 --> 02:36:42.982]  Phil Mudd, if I was going to cast somebody as like a lunatic in an asylum if I was the director, I mean, Phil Mudd, that's who, as you know, the aid to Camp Mueller's main
[02:36:43.763 --> 02:36:45.545]  Groom of the stool is this guy.
[02:36:45.625 --> 02:36:51.710]  Yeah, no, the first thing he needs to do is immediately contact Glenn Beck and get lessons on how to do the fake crying thing.
[02:36:51.730 --> 02:36:53.271]  Because that was pathetic.
[02:36:53.631 --> 02:36:54.412]  Paw-thetic.
[02:36:55.373 --> 02:36:57.995]  Let's play the clip again, then it cuts to Obama.
[02:36:58.015 --> 02:37:01.558]  Remember his fake crying when he had to, like, touch his eyes with pepper or whatever?
[02:37:02.799 --> 02:37:10.265]  So here's Obama who funds the Arab Spring, murdering hundreds of thousands of Christians, says he's really good at killing people, supports Hillary and all her crimes.
[02:37:11.025 --> 02:37:12.607]  Here is Mudd once again.
[02:37:13.470 --> 02:37:14.991]  I have ten nieces and nephews.
[02:37:15.011 --> 02:37:16.571]  We're talking about bump stocks.
[02:37:17.052 --> 02:37:18.732]  We're talking about legislation.
[02:37:18.752 --> 02:37:21.494]  A child of God is dead.
[02:37:22.594 --> 02:37:28.216]  Cannot we acknowledge in this country that we cannot accept this?
[02:37:28.877 --> 02:37:29.757]  I can't do it, Wolf.
[02:37:29.917 --> 02:37:30.537]  I'm sorry.
[02:37:30.818 --> 02:37:31.618]  We can't do it.
[02:37:31.918 --> 02:37:32.298]  I'm sorry.
[02:37:32.338 --> 02:37:33.539]  I can't make myself cry, Wolf.
[02:37:33.559 --> 02:37:34.839]  Please cut away.
[02:37:34.899 --> 02:37:38.961]  We're going to get back to you, but you're obviously, this is so emotional.
[02:37:39.321 --> 02:37:40.282]  And from every family,
[02:37:41.443 --> 02:37:46.788]  Who never imagined that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet from a gun.
[02:37:51.312 --> 02:37:53.574]  I'm sorry the Arab Spring didn't kill all of you.
[02:37:53.594 --> 02:37:55.596]  It didn't get you Christians though.
[02:37:55.616 --> 02:37:57.217]  The Father, Mother, and Brotherhood.
[02:37:57.237 --> 02:37:59.639]  God doesn't want to kill all Christians.
[02:38:00.901 --> 02:38:01.381]  There he is.
[02:38:01.461 --> 02:38:04.524]  Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad.
[02:38:08.002 --> 02:38:10.905]  And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.
[02:38:18.314 --> 02:38:24.101]  So, all of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up
[02:38:27.589 --> 02:38:28.730]  The gun lobby's lies.
[02:38:29.491 --> 02:38:31.492]  You can see the words he took like peppermint.
[02:38:31.652 --> 02:38:32.973]  First he touches his eyes.
[02:38:33.413 --> 02:38:35.495]  He's a good CIA guy.
[02:38:35.935 --> 02:38:39.097]  He touches his eyes with peppermint or something and then he cries.
[02:38:39.197 --> 02:38:41.119]  I mean that is an old vaudeville trick.
[02:38:42.340 --> 02:38:45.402]  We need the wide majority of responsible gun owners
[02:38:46.889 --> 02:38:59.660]  Well, first of all, I would urge CNN to get Phil Mudd on as much as possible.
[02:38:59.700 --> 02:39:01.762]  At this point, he's kind of like Adam Schiff.
[02:39:01.862 --> 02:39:03.624]  We need him out there as a punchline.
[02:39:03.944 --> 02:39:05.866]  People see him and our movement grows.
[02:39:05.906 --> 02:39:07.067]  The opposition grows.
[02:39:07.147 --> 02:39:09.009]  But Mudd looks like a lunatic.
[02:39:09.309 --> 02:39:11.570]  No, it's so ridiculously phony.
[02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:14.110]  How could anybody buy into that performance?
[02:39:15.390 --> 02:39:19.951]  And the real takeaway here, again, Mr. Mudd, is your beloved FBI.
[02:39:20.412 --> 02:39:22.172]  Why were they asleep at the switch?
[02:39:22.552 --> 02:39:25.833]  They had been talking about this shooter, and they did nothing.
[02:39:26.273 --> 02:39:27.573]  That's the news story today.
[02:39:27.793 --> 02:39:28.793]  It's just so fake.
[02:39:29.654 --> 02:39:30.954]  But expanding on that,
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:36.445]  He's the one calling for violence against the president, and the government's gonna kill him.
[02:39:36.725 --> 02:39:40.830]  He needs the visit, just like this shooter in Florida and the FBI stood down.
[02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:42.492]  They need to go visit Mudd.
[02:39:42.572 --> 02:39:43.593]  Is he gonna mass shoot?
[02:39:43.953 --> 02:39:45.115]  He's definitely cracking up.
[02:39:46.087 --> 02:39:48.449]  Well, I mean, would you trust him with your children?
[02:39:49.090 --> 02:39:51.091]  I wouldn't trust him anywhere near my children.
[02:39:51.111 --> 02:39:54.534]  Look, I have a son who's a Broward County deputy sheriff.
[02:39:55.195 --> 02:39:59.058]  I have a daughter who's a nurse in the Broward County hospital system.
[02:39:59.699 --> 02:40:01.921]  My son was on the scene yesterday.
[02:40:01.941 --> 02:40:04.463]  He can't talk about it, but we had dinner with both of them.
[02:40:04.483 --> 02:40:05.184]  They're awesome people.
[02:40:05.484 --> 02:40:08.888]  He can't talk about it other than to say, Dad, it was just horrific.
[02:40:08.948 --> 02:40:09.409]  It happened.
[02:40:09.829 --> 02:40:12.292]  And he has two small daughters of his own.
[02:40:12.853 --> 02:40:21.924]  My daughter at the hospital who attended some of those injured, she can't talk about it either other than to say that she's distraught and it's just beyond her belief.
[02:40:22.505 --> 02:40:23.245]  But let's not...
[02:40:24.181 --> 02:40:25.883]  Let's not get anything confused here.
[02:40:25.903 --> 02:40:27.624]  This guy was planning this in advance.
[02:40:28.084 --> 02:40:30.927]  This cannot be based on the Second Amendment.
[02:40:30.967 --> 02:40:33.609]  It cannot be based on mental illness, yet, that we know.
[02:40:33.989 --> 02:40:36.031]  He was rational enough to make a plan.
[02:40:36.091 --> 02:40:38.173]  He was rational enough to have a plan to escape.
[02:40:39.134 --> 02:40:41.656]  The Israelis have the best take on this.
[02:40:41.856 --> 02:40:48.902]  These killers, generally speaking, have no tendency towards suicide, depression, alcoholism, drug abuse.
[02:40:49.403 --> 02:40:51.905]  This is a rational domestic terrorist.
[02:40:54.446 --> 02:41:05.298]  It's confirmed though that if he is the only guy there that they knew this was coming so why is nothing done when you fit the profile and you say I'm
[02:41:07.679 --> 02:41:11.544]  Nicholas Cruz and I want to be like the Whitman shooter at the tower.
[02:41:11.564 --> 02:41:12.526]  I'm going to be a mass shooter.
[02:41:12.546 --> 02:41:13.567]  Why don't you then get in trouble?
[02:41:14.468 --> 02:41:15.850]  Exactly.
[02:41:16.331 --> 02:41:21.979]  Why does no one show up at your apartment or your home for at a minimum an interrogation?
[02:41:22.039 --> 02:41:24.081]  Why are you not put under surveillance?
[02:41:24.582 --> 02:41:34.629]  We seem to have the time and the resources to surveil the President of the United States in his campaign, but we don't have the resources to surveil somebody who has threatened a mass killing at a school.
[02:41:34.969 --> 02:41:37.031]  What's going on at the FBI?
[02:41:37.371 --> 02:41:43.335]  What is wrong with what was once the greatest law enforcement agency probably in the world?
[02:41:44.656 --> 02:41:45.357]  It's really sad.
[02:41:47.082 --> 02:41:52.004]  And notice, it's the media making stuff up, mainstream media, that introduces lies.
[02:41:52.544 --> 02:41:56.826]  Trump's like, oh my gosh, everybody in the school's mourning, the FBI was called, why did this happen again?
[02:41:56.846 --> 02:41:58.087]  You know, all these problems.
[02:41:58.107 --> 02:42:04.129]  And then the media goes, fake media, Salon, you name it, that oh, Trump's blaming the victims.
[02:42:04.169 --> 02:42:05.690]  That introduces that narrative.
[02:42:06.130 --> 02:42:10.312]  They're the ones that introduce the narrative by claiming that Trump actually said that.
[02:42:11.232 --> 02:42:12.596]  Well, you can go on Twitter today.
[02:42:12.656 --> 02:42:18.590]  There are bots putting out the idea that there's a photo of the shooter wearing a Make America Great hat.
[02:42:19.884 --> 02:42:20.424]  No, there isn't.
[02:42:20.504 --> 02:42:21.164]  That's a lie.
[02:42:21.284 --> 02:42:25.905]  But paid bots, probably paid for by David Brock and the people at Media Matters for America.
[02:42:25.925 --> 02:42:27.485]  And see, we don't even do stuff like that.
[02:42:27.525 --> 02:42:28.686]  We don't do those dirty tricks.
[02:42:28.946 --> 02:42:30.866]  We get accused of it, but we don't really do it.
[02:42:31.006 --> 02:42:33.806]  I mean, it's really, it's an absurdity.
[02:42:34.427 --> 02:42:41.388]  If the guy was at a white supremacist camp, trust me, nine out of the ten other people there were federal informants and on the payroll of the- Well, we know that.
[02:42:41.448 --> 02:42:41.968]  We know that.
[02:42:42.028 --> 02:42:43.128]  So it's perfect timing.
[02:42:43.148 --> 02:42:46.389]  That's all I'm saying is, I see false flag written all over this.
[02:42:46.509 --> 02:42:48.149]  And the witnesses, I don't know if you've seen the videos.
[02:42:48.849 --> 02:42:51.591]  We've had the student on, other students, very credible.
[02:42:52.012 --> 02:42:53.172]  They said multiple shooters.
[02:42:53.293 --> 02:42:56.415]  They said they were with him while the shots were going off.
[02:42:56.815 --> 02:42:57.496]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:57.816 --> 02:42:58.336]  Stay with us.
[02:43:01.319 --> 02:43:03.280]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:03.300 --> 02:43:03.741]  Go ahead.
[02:43:04.001 --> 02:43:06.202]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:06.222 --> 02:43:09.265]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:10.077 --> 02:43:11.198]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:11.498 --> 02:43:13.220]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:15.982]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:16.242 --> 02:43:20.246]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:20.266 --> 02:43:22.748]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:23.568 --> 02:43:25.890]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:26.251 --> 02:43:27.352]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:27.612 --> 02:43:28.493]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:28.733 --> 02:43:29.754]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:30.194 --> 02:43:31.234]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:31.274 --> 02:43:32.355]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:43:32.375 --> 02:43:33.195]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:33.475 --> 02:43:38.836]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:39.136 --> 02:43:43.417]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:43.657 --> 02:43:46.518]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:46.778 --> 02:43:47.158]  You understand?
[02:43:47.258 --> 02:43:48.518]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:48.899 --> 02:43:50.019]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:51.019 --> 02:43:55.880]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:43:56.620 --> 02:43:57.340]  Do you understand?
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:58.581]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:58.981 --> 02:44:00.481]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:44:01.001 --> 02:44:02.402]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:44:02.642 --> 02:44:03.942]  You can't survive without it.
[02:44:04.142 --> 02:44:05.042]  But where do you get it?
[02:44:05.342 --> 02:44:11.104]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:44:11.324 --> 02:44:17.045]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:44:17.245 --> 02:44:34.106]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:44:34.506 --> 02:44:36.627]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:44:36.988 --> 02:44:38.188]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:44:38.448 --> 02:44:39.209]  Easy assembly.
[02:44:39.489 --> 02:44:40.130]  Low maintenance.
[02:44:40.410 --> 02:44:42.231]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:45:02.310 --> 02:45:06.751]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:45:06.971 --> 02:45:11.672]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:45:12.272 --> 02:45:18.113]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[02:45:18.533 --> 02:45:31.135]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[02:45:31.895 --> 02:45:40.603]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:45:40.623 --> 02:45:42.505]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:45:42.825 --> 02:45:43.946]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:45:43.966 --> 02:45:45.248]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:45:45.448 --> 02:45:46.629]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:45:46.829 --> 02:45:48.309]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:45:48.809 --> 02:45:50.450]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:45:50.770 --> 02:45:52.230]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:45:52.570 --> 02:45:55.191]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:45:55.231 --> 02:45:56.091]  This is insane.
[02:45:56.491 --> 02:45:58.111]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:45:58.371 --> 02:46:00.932]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:46:01.372 --> 02:46:02.892]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:46:02.932 --> 02:46:04.753]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:46:04.773 --> 02:46:06.633]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:46:07.493 --> 02:46:13.415]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:46:13.675 --> 02:46:15.015]  All just moderate dose.
[02:46:16.544 --> 02:46:24.535]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:46:24.555 --> 02:46:26.938]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:26.958 --> 02:46:28.540]  But thank you for committing.
[02:46:32.196 --> 02:46:35.017]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:46:35.397 --> 02:46:37.998]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:46:38.018 --> 02:46:42.800]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:52.524]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out so you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:46:52.864 --> 02:46:54.165]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:47:05.295 --> 02:47:07.930]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:27.219 --> 02:47:29.421]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:29.761 --> 02:47:35.366]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:47:36.267 --> 02:47:39.750]  By the way, Roger's going to be co-hosting the War Room coming up after the fourth hour.
[02:47:39.770 --> 02:47:42.853]  Anthony Cumia, always riveting out of New York City.
[02:47:43.413 --> 02:47:44.314]  Love his take on everything.
[02:47:44.334 --> 02:47:48.137]  A lot of people say, hey, one guest says one thing, another guest says another thing.
[02:47:48.598 --> 02:47:50.799]  This isn't congruent like CNN or Fox News.
[02:47:50.819 --> 02:47:51.500]  We're not a cult.
[02:47:52.061 --> 02:47:53.402]  We're trying to figure out what's going on.
[02:47:53.442 --> 02:47:54.603]  We're breaking down what's happening.
[02:47:55.714 --> 02:48:06.777]  Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, has come out and called for the White House to go along with Congress to look at gun violence issues and gun control.
[02:48:07.377 --> 02:48:13.859]  So that can show you the type of people trying to get political points with mainstream media, which is completely pointless.
[02:48:13.939 --> 02:48:18.500]  Again, we've had this year and last year a bunch of truck attacks all over Europe and the U.S.
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:19.801]  killing hundreds of people.
[02:48:19.821 --> 02:48:24.142]  Do we have whole things about banning Opel cars or Ford trucks?
[02:48:24.722 --> 02:48:25.863]  Or Mercedes vans.
[02:48:26.764 --> 02:48:27.365]  No, we don't.
[02:48:27.625 --> 02:48:28.986]  It's an issue with people.
[02:48:29.387 --> 02:48:31.109]  Plus, mass shootings are flat.
[02:48:31.469 --> 02:48:32.670]  Overall shootings are down.
[02:48:33.411 --> 02:48:35.753]  Since 1992, almost 60%.
[02:48:36.134 --> 02:48:37.355]  These are facts.
[02:48:38.055 --> 02:48:42.820]  Unless you're in a Democrat-controlled area like Chicago or whatever, crime has actually been way down overall.
[02:48:42.900 --> 02:48:46.284]  It's gone up a little bit the last few years, but not from its overall drop.
[02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:55.295]  You know, Alex, I think one of the problems here is that the president really, this is mild criticism, he didn't choose a wartime cabinet.
[02:48:55.935 --> 02:49:05.320]  He had an expectation level, not unreasonable, like every president before him, that the country would unify after a president election, that he would have some Democrats into his cabinet.
[02:49:05.340 --> 02:49:07.722]  He invited Al Gore to come visit him as president-elect.
[02:49:07.782 --> 02:49:09.643]  He invited the Reverend Al Sharpton to visit him.
[02:49:10.023 --> 02:49:11.184]  He put out the olive branch.
[02:49:11.764 --> 02:49:28.072]  He did not expect the whole Russian charade, the attempt to get a recount, the attempt to topple him in the Electoral College, this ongoing fraudulent investigation by Robert Mueller, the Trump is crazy campaign, the 25th Amendment campaign.
[02:49:28.432 --> 02:49:30.653]  He actually expected the country would come together.
[02:49:30.793 --> 02:49:31.554]  Steve Mnuchin
[02:49:32.174 --> 02:49:33.255]  He's a liberal Democrat.
[02:49:33.575 --> 02:49:36.636]  Steve Mnuchin was the finance chairman of Donald Trump's campaign.
[02:49:37.096 --> 02:49:39.677]  He raised virtually nothing, almost nothing.
[02:49:40.217 --> 02:49:45.960]  The president has a soft spot for him personally, but he is not the strongman of this cabinet.
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:50.622]  Reminds me of something Richard Nixon once said regarding Elliot Richardson.
[02:49:51.082 --> 02:49:56.004]  He said, you know, when the chips are down, these Ivy League types will not stick with you.
[02:49:56.564 --> 02:49:57.504]  That's exactly right.
[02:49:58.224 --> 02:50:01.465]  And we have some weak sisters in this cabinet.
[02:50:01.485 --> 02:50:01.905]  That's it!
[02:50:01.945 --> 02:50:09.147]  I mean, if you look at people like Mudd and folks at the CIA, now FBI, compared to the people who actually do the work, people who do the work are smarter, stronger, everything.
[02:50:09.747 --> 02:50:12.968]  They put little, I don't want to say effeminate, because it makes women look bad.
[02:50:13.348 --> 02:50:20.910]  They're these little mutated, grimy men that just weasel around and BS and backstab and they're all looking for power.
[02:50:20.970 --> 02:50:23.551]  I mean, they're the ones running the country in the ground.
[02:50:23.611 --> 02:50:24.351]  They're the problem.
[02:50:25.251 --> 02:50:26.792]  Phil Mudd is America's enemy.
[02:50:27.012 --> 02:50:27.372]  Agreed.
[02:50:27.392 --> 02:50:31.455]  And we have to keep saying this, unfortunately, because they mischaracterize our position.
[02:50:32.075 --> 02:50:36.618]  We are not denigrating the rank-and-file men and women in these law enforcement agencies.
[02:50:37.038 --> 02:50:38.459]  They are as disgusted as we are.
[02:50:38.499 --> 02:50:41.041]  But Phil Mudd is a political sycophant of the globalists.
[02:50:41.161 --> 02:50:44.104]  This guy's a political appointee, he's not a veteran lawman.
[02:50:44.164 --> 02:50:51.111]  The rank-and-file agents in both the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency and all these federal agencies... They're all listeners!
[02:50:51.271 --> 02:50:51.792]  They're patriotic.
[02:50:51.812 --> 02:50:52.773]  Let's say it, let's say it.
[02:50:52.873 --> 02:50:55.676]  They're the reason Trump got elected, helping the American people.
[02:50:55.936 --> 02:51:00.861]  That's why it's a paradox, like the worst thing is the government, the best thing is the government.
[02:51:01.121 --> 02:51:03.502]  So, they hate the politicization of where they work.
[02:51:03.582 --> 02:51:07.004]  They realize that it erodes the mission of the departments.
[02:51:07.345 --> 02:51:09.786]  We are not attacking individual FBI agents.
[02:51:09.826 --> 02:51:10.987]  They are good men and women.
[02:51:11.507 --> 02:51:14.849]  They are as disgusted as we are by the corruption at the very top.
[02:51:16.770 --> 02:51:17.530]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:51:17.550 --> 02:51:21.613]  The media makes it like, oh, they hate the FBI because they're saying the FBI didn't do anything.
[02:51:21.933 --> 02:51:23.213]  They were ordered to not do anything.
[02:51:23.253 --> 02:51:24.374]  Just like San Bernardino.
[02:51:24.394 --> 02:51:27.076]  It was the FBI agents and federal marshals.
[02:51:28.100 --> 02:51:28.440]  We're good to go.
[02:51:47.268 --> 02:51:51.494]  So again, it was good FBI and Federal Marshals, but they were ordered to stand down.
[02:51:52.235 --> 02:51:54.959]  Look, this all comes back to something I said on yesterday's show.
[02:51:55.740 --> 02:51:59.825]  The President absolutely must get control of his Justice Department.
[02:52:00.306 --> 02:52:02.048]  That is the key to this.
[02:52:02.289 --> 02:52:04.632]  The crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas, the
[02:52:05.832 --> 02:52:27.320]  The illegal and unconstitutional surveillance of the Republican candidate for president, the crimes at the IRS, the crimes at the Clinton Foundation, the crimes regarding Hillary Clinton's email server, the rank corruption of the previous administration, the ongoing malfeasance, the illegal role of John Brennan.
[02:52:27.780 --> 02:52:29.780]  All these people should be prosecuted.
[02:52:30.301 --> 02:52:31.021]  All it takes
[02:52:31.741 --> 02:52:36.404]  ...is an attorney general with the Cojones and a commitment to the rule of law.
[02:52:36.904 --> 02:52:43.227]  Right now we have Rod Rosenstein, who is the de facto attorney general, and he's playing for the other team.
[02:52:43.267 --> 02:52:45.368]  And he ran the whole fake investigation.
[02:52:45.388 --> 02:52:54.093]  And let's be clear, the good thing coming out of this Russiagate is they jumped the shark, even though it's distracted from other news and become a whole false narrative we have to counter like a black hole.
[02:52:55.501 --> 02:53:06.335]  That is really what's happened here, is it's proven the deep state, it's proven the criminal elements, it's proven their fraud, and it's drawn them out into crimes publicly, that if we actually press the matter, we'll be their waterloo.
[02:53:06.715 --> 02:53:07.877]  And that's why they're so scared.
[02:53:08.291 --> 02:53:09.332]  Well, let's put it this way.
[02:53:09.392 --> 02:53:11.993]  They put all their chips on red, and they lose.
[02:53:13.174 --> 02:53:20.799]  Why do Schiff and Swalwell keep saying, oh no, there was additional evidence on which the request for warrants was based?
[02:53:20.939 --> 02:53:22.620]  Okay, boys, what is it?
[02:53:23.341 --> 02:53:23.821]  What is it?
[02:53:23.861 --> 02:53:24.621]  You have nothing.
[02:53:24.701 --> 02:53:25.982]  It's the fake dossier.
[02:53:26.002 --> 02:53:30.525]  Well, just like you've been accused of solid evidence of Russian agent, they just say in Congress, I am.
[02:53:30.705 --> 02:53:31.286]  BS!
[02:53:31.626 --> 02:53:32.126]  Yeah.
[02:53:32.166 --> 02:53:34.908]  I mean, I know there's zero, because there is zero.
[02:53:36.948 --> 02:53:39.909]  And since when do they for years say somebody something?
[02:53:40.129 --> 02:53:41.029]  Where's our indictments?
[02:53:41.409 --> 02:53:42.309]  Where's the subpoenas?
[02:53:42.369 --> 02:53:42.969]  Give it to me.
[02:53:43.709 --> 02:53:44.610]  Put me in front of Congress.
[02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:45.990]  Like you said, no, it's all secret.
[02:53:46.170 --> 02:53:47.390]  They made you testify in secret.
[02:53:47.410 --> 02:53:48.750]  Because I will destroy them!
[02:53:49.230 --> 02:53:50.631]  They malign you in public.
[02:53:51.011 --> 02:53:56.272]  You know, it's interesting because we watched Mark Warner yesterday in a stellar performance, a senator from Virginia.
[02:53:56.732 --> 02:54:03.493]  When my lawyers examined the question of whether I had legal action against all these Democrats, and we cataloged what each one of them had said,
[02:54:04.513 --> 02:54:08.695]  And then we came to the conclusion that there's a congressional shield.
[02:54:08.735 --> 02:54:11.497]  They can call you anything they want and not be held responsible.
[02:54:11.517 --> 02:54:12.277]  Only in Congress.
[02:54:12.377 --> 02:54:19.681]  The guy who was most egregious, the guy who said, Roger Stone works for the Kremlin, he said, was Mark Warner.
[02:54:20.061 --> 02:54:24.924]  If he were not hiding behind his congressional immunity, I would sue him in a heartbeat.
[02:54:25.024 --> 02:54:26.545]  I've never been to Russia.
[02:54:26.865 --> 02:54:28.506]  I've never had any Russian clients.
[02:54:28.866 --> 02:54:32.288]  I've never had any Ukrainian clients who are affiliated with Russia.
[02:54:32.768 --> 02:54:33.688]  It's a lie.
[02:54:33.908 --> 02:54:35.749]  But isn't that their victory?
[02:54:36.529 --> 02:54:40.650]  That we should be working with Russia with all their resources, triple or more what we have.
[02:54:41.150 --> 02:54:42.551]  Russia's now Christian conservative.
[02:54:43.951 --> 02:54:51.733]  Regardless, they make us all denounce Russia, and then they're the ones in bed with some of the Russians, and then they control everything like they dictate reality.
[02:54:51.853 --> 02:54:53.514]  That's why I'm going to Russia in May.
[02:54:53.834 --> 02:54:57.595]  I'm setting it up, I'm going, because I'm going to go find out who my bosses are.
[02:54:58.035 --> 02:55:00.558]  You gotta get one of those giant bearskin hats.
[02:55:00.618 --> 02:55:04.382]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'm gonna go over there and preach Americanism and free market.
[02:55:04.422 --> 02:55:04.943]  I'm so evil.
[02:55:05.243 --> 02:55:07.025]  Well, look, the point of this is pretty clear.
[02:55:07.066 --> 02:55:11.791]  What they're really upset about is that they didn't get the war in Syria that Hillary promised them.
[02:55:12.191 --> 02:55:14.714]  She promised the Deep State a proxy war.
[02:55:14.875 --> 02:55:17.377]  Let me ask about Netanyahu, because, you know, nobody's perfect, but...
[02:55:18.618 --> 02:55:21.199]  The Soros documents, he wants to overthrow Israel.
[02:55:21.299 --> 02:55:24.721]  All these weird leftist Jews are funding the overthrow of Israel.
[02:55:24.761 --> 02:55:26.682]  That's in the documents, even the Jerusalem Post.
[02:55:27.422 --> 02:55:35.105]  And it's like, it's, and now Netanyahu, they want to put him in jail over paying for a chef for meetings with foreign leaders.
[02:55:35.145 --> 02:55:36.106]  I thought a president got his...
[02:55:36.866 --> 02:55:40.851]  Well, what's interesting here, of course, is that they keep claiming that the Russians interfered in our election.
[02:55:55.248 --> 02:56:02.576]  Obama interfered in the Israeli election and the American taxpayers paid hundreds of millions of dollars for that interference.
[02:56:02.656 --> 02:56:07.861]  They really thought they had the defeat of Netanyahu's party in the back.
[02:56:07.902 --> 02:56:08.923]  And it didn't happen.
[02:56:09.003 --> 02:56:10.544]  He wanted a starting upset.
[02:56:10.564 --> 02:56:12.266]  This is plan B for them.
[02:56:12.346 --> 02:56:13.087]  Oh, we couldn't beat him.
[02:56:13.107 --> 02:56:15.730]  So it's about a bunch of Hollywood leftists wanting to run Israel.
[02:56:15.930 --> 02:56:16.431]  Does this sound familiar?
[02:56:16.451 --> 02:56:21.596]  We couldn't beat him in the election, so now we're going to take him out on some trumped-up corruption charge.
[02:56:21.636 --> 02:56:23.078]  Does this sound vaguely familiar?
[02:56:23.098 --> 02:56:23.819]  This game plan?
[02:56:23.839 --> 02:56:24.299]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:56:24.319 --> 02:56:25.240]  It's the exact same game plan.
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:25.901]  Exactly.
[02:56:25.981 --> 02:56:32.087]  And then I read the stuff, it's like they had 10 state dinners, and the government paid for the president of this country to eat dinner at their house.
[02:56:33.268 --> 02:56:36.169]  I mean, they don't pay for President's dinners at their house?
[02:56:36.189 --> 02:56:37.489]  With world leaders?
[02:56:37.509 --> 02:56:42.151]  So Netanyahu literally... I saw one of the dinner menus was Mexican food.
[02:56:42.191 --> 02:56:43.091]  He had enchiladas.
[02:56:43.591 --> 02:56:53.534]  The only good thing I hear is the guy who's supposed to step into his place is every bit a strong critic of the Iranian arms deal and very pro-Trump as well.
[02:56:53.894 --> 02:56:55.014]  So they lose in the end.
[02:56:55.295 --> 02:56:56.515]  So it's like no matter what they do, they lose?
[02:56:57.035 --> 02:56:57.415]  Right now.
[02:56:58.056 --> 02:56:59.477]  Let them try to win an election there.
[02:56:59.877 --> 02:57:01.458]  They outspent them and they outmaneuvered them.
[02:57:01.478 --> 02:57:08.682]  But why does Soros, I know he sold Jews out, you know, as a Nazi collaborator, why is he in the WikiLeaks wanting to overthrow Israel?
[02:57:08.762 --> 02:57:10.183]  What's the point?
[02:57:10.343 --> 02:57:11.984]  So the Arabs all kill each other over it?
[02:57:12.024 --> 02:57:15.226]  First of all, he's a self-hating Jew, that's abundantly clear.
[02:57:15.266 --> 02:57:16.186]  And it's not just Israel.
[02:57:16.466 --> 02:57:19.788]  He's trying to overthrow the government of Hungary, the government of Romania.
[02:57:19.808 --> 02:57:20.649]  He wants to run it all.
[02:57:20.809 --> 02:57:21.449]  He really does.
[02:57:21.469 --> 02:57:22.790]  We're going to go to break, come back.
[02:57:23.370 --> 02:57:24.331]  By the way, toothpaste.
[02:57:24.611 --> 02:57:30.075]  A high-quality, fluoride-free and powered 4 to 5 with a little silver and iodine, super blue.
[02:57:30.096 --> 02:57:32.778]  50% off throughout the weekend, and then that sale is over.
[02:57:33.118 --> 02:57:43.406]  And a bunch of other 50% off deals are about to end at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com to extract the supplements, or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:43.947 --> 02:57:47.870]  Whatever you do, spread the articles and the videos from InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:57:48.090 --> 02:57:50.192]  They're trying to kill our signal, but they can't stop you.
[02:57:54.659 --> 02:57:55.980]  Kevin in Virginia.
[02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:58.101]  You can jump anytime you want, uh, Roger Stone.
[02:57:58.141 --> 02:57:58.682]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:57:58.722 --> 02:57:59.542]  Hey, hey, Alex.
[02:57:59.602 --> 02:58:02.644]  Hey, um, my girlfriend was hit by a car a few years ago.
[02:58:02.664 --> 02:58:02.704]  Oh.
[02:58:03.165 --> 02:58:05.887]  And she died twice on the way to Hershey Medical Center.
[02:58:06.387 --> 02:58:11.310]  I mean, so there was some serious brain injury and she has a brachial plexus on her right side.
[02:58:11.370 --> 02:58:13.011]  She's kind of paralyzed on her right side.
[02:58:13.432 --> 02:58:15.453]  But besides that, I put her on brain force.
[02:58:15.533 --> 02:58:18.435]  Alex, her quality of life, you don't understand.
[02:58:19.095 --> 02:58:20.116]  She can remember names.
[02:58:21.017 --> 02:58:22.578]  She can remember a lot of stuff.
[02:58:23.138 --> 02:58:27.261]  And her quality of life because of your product is one of the best that I've ever seen.
[02:58:27.281 --> 02:58:32.024]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart, coming out with something like that.
[02:58:32.424 --> 02:58:34.185]  Because you have changed somebody's life.
[02:58:35.214 --> 02:58:35.754]  For the better.
[02:58:36.134 --> 02:58:39.275]  And it's one of the most powerful things that I've ever seen.
[02:58:39.875 --> 02:58:40.915]  Because of your brain force.
[02:58:41.115 --> 02:58:42.116]  She can remember things.
[02:58:42.736 --> 02:58:44.256]  And it's just awesome.
[02:58:44.556 --> 02:58:49.337]  You don't know how great and how happy I am because of that.
[02:58:49.457 --> 02:58:50.178]  And I thank you.
[02:58:50.358 --> 02:58:53.418]  And I know you're a real person and a good person because of that.
[02:58:53.999 --> 02:58:55.359]  I know you have the American's heart.
[02:58:56.079 --> 02:58:56.919]  Well, absolutely.
[02:58:56.939 --> 02:59:02.881]  Look, I believe everybody doing good than I do good, but we're going to set out to have a product to research whatever is already the best and discount it.
[02:59:03.422 --> 02:59:04.802]  Show you love and order again.
[02:59:04.822 --> 02:59:07.703]  I mean, it's self-serving as well, I take it.
[02:59:08.583 --> 02:59:10.284]  Roger Stone lives by it, don't you, Roger?
[02:59:10.664 --> 02:59:15.506]  Yeah, no, look, of all the products on the InfoWars store, this is my absolute favorite.
[02:59:15.846 --> 02:59:21.408]  I find that I get this dip in energy, both mental and physical energy, around four in the afternoon.
[02:59:21.428 --> 02:59:21.768]  Me too.
[02:59:22.408 --> 02:59:32.292]  I pop two of these, and I get mental clarity, I get mental energy, I get a slight lift in my physical energy, and I'm able to work another seven, eight hours.
[02:59:32.992 --> 02:59:37.974]  And I really find Brain Force Plus just extraordinarily effective.
[02:59:38.074 --> 02:59:43.357]  Yet, I can sleep, there's no hangover, you're not ramped up, you're not amped up the way amphetamines do.
[02:59:43.597 --> 02:59:44.877]  I can't say enough about it.
[02:59:44.937 --> 02:59:47.798]  Kevin, we love you and thank you, and we're all in it together, brother.
[02:59:48.379 --> 02:59:49.079]  Thank you so much.
[02:59:56.385 --> 03:00:08.758]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:08.798 --> 03:00:12.382]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[03:00:12.923 --> 03:00:14.885]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.520 --> 03:00:17.621]  It is Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.681 --> 03:00:20.604]  That announcer is a little too obsessed.
[03:00:20.664 --> 03:00:26.630]  I've called him and said, you're a great announcer, Peter Reif, but just don't say it like you're announcing the name of Jesus Christ.
[03:00:26.650 --> 03:00:28.412]  More like, it's Alex Jones, your host.
[03:00:28.492 --> 03:00:29.313]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:00:29.693 --> 03:00:31.735]  Some of these new liners, I've not approved, but they're on.
[03:00:31.755 --> 03:00:33.217]  I don't mean to go off into a side issue.
[03:00:33.237 --> 03:00:35.619]  It's like, Alex Jones, oh.
[03:00:36.100 --> 03:00:37.021]  But seriously,
[03:00:38.337 --> 03:00:38.737]  Strange!
[03:00:38.797 --> 03:00:43.059]  Responders throw body bag in back of truck amid Florida shooting.
[03:00:43.099 --> 03:00:43.879]  There's video of that.
[03:00:43.939 --> 03:00:44.620]  Very bizarre.
[03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:51.262]  You've got people reporting multiple shooters saying they're with the supposed shooter while guns are going off.
[03:00:51.663 --> 03:00:52.923]  That's on Infowars.com.
[03:00:52.943 --> 03:00:54.384]  We're going to find out about all of that.
[03:00:55.224 --> 03:00:59.706]  But what else is on your radar screen and what are you going to be covering in about an hour when you close the war room?
[03:01:00.006 --> 03:01:03.108]  Well, one thing I want to say about the shooting in Florida.
[03:01:03.328 --> 03:01:07.111]  One of the odd things about Las Vegas was that we still don't have any answers.
[03:01:07.631 --> 03:01:11.654]  The sheriff's office, the FBI, the coroner, none of them have been forthcoming.
[03:01:12.355 --> 03:01:16.838]  The Broward County Sheriff, Scott Israel, is a man of enormous integrity.
[03:01:17.778 --> 03:01:18.739]  He's non-political.
[03:01:18.799 --> 03:01:20.400]  He's a by-the-book lawman.
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:25.164]  Even though he is elected as a Democrat, he is not a very political animal.
[03:01:25.664 --> 03:01:30.688]  Crime in every category is down in the county I live in, which is a major urban county.
[03:01:31.228 --> 03:01:33.530]  This is not a guy who will go along with a cover-up.
[03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:35.351]  It's just not his nature.
[03:01:35.771 --> 03:01:37.493]  And the investigation is his.
[03:01:37.713 --> 03:01:39.954]  The FBI is supposedly there to help.
[03:01:40.035 --> 03:01:41.896]  So, unlike Las Vegas,
[03:01:42.416 --> 03:01:45.057]  I look forward to learning what really happened here.
[03:01:45.077 --> 03:01:48.479]  I have a lot of confidence in local law enforcement where I live.
[03:01:51.140 --> 03:01:52.241]  Closest to Mar-a-Lago?
[03:01:53.221 --> 03:02:00.064]  This is in the western part of Broward County, which is the large urban county just north of Palm Beach.
[03:02:00.964 --> 03:02:04.186]  A 25-minute drive, perhaps, to Mar-a-Lago.
[03:02:04.986 --> 03:02:10.709]  Could there have been some effort to embarrass the President because he was headed there this weekend?
[03:02:11.667 --> 03:02:12.728]  Certainly a possibility.
[03:02:13.890 --> 03:02:16.793]  When I tried to ask questions about this, they're still identifying bodies.
[03:02:17.374 --> 03:02:24.623]  I don't think we're far enough along in the investigation, but I don't expect the kind of stonewalling that we saw in Las Vegas.
[03:02:24.763 --> 03:02:27.446]  And by the way, we don't toot our horn because it's a tragedy.
[03:02:28.007 --> 03:02:29.249]  Vegas, the wheels have come off.
[03:02:29.289 --> 03:02:29.829]  They admit
[03:02:30.909 --> 03:02:35.274]  Basically, arms deals, foreign governments, cover-ups, mind control.
[03:02:35.315 --> 03:02:36.115]  That's in the news now.
[03:02:36.135 --> 03:02:36.996]  I mean, it is crazy.
[03:02:37.197 --> 03:02:41.001]  Look, I give enormous credit to the investigative reporting of Laura Loomer.
[03:02:41.021 --> 03:02:48.870]  I think she's done an extraordinary job of busting this open, being unwilling to accept the official version of BS, and cutting right through it.
[03:02:49.531 --> 03:02:59.075]  She did a great job going to Vegas, and then we had our hostage rescue team sources that told us he went to the Middle East, and the day after, and telling us the stuff that all came out later.
[03:02:59.156 --> 03:03:01.377]  That just shows how accurate those sources are.
[03:03:01.397 --> 03:03:03.598]  I don't see this derailing Trump.
[03:03:03.678 --> 03:03:08.160]  I mean, what else do you think could try to, I don't want to give him ideas, could try to stop Trump?
[03:03:09.212 --> 03:03:12.815]  The resurgence, I guess just infiltration, co-opting?
[03:03:12.975 --> 03:03:18.399]  Well, in the war room today we're going to be talking about the scramble to become the White House Chief of Staff.
[03:03:18.519 --> 03:03:22.962]  I think this is fraught with real peril for the President.
[03:03:23.202 --> 03:03:24.823]  And you did call it that Kelly's leaving.
[03:03:25.123 --> 03:03:26.124]  He is toast.
[03:03:26.184 --> 03:03:29.927]  We could bring up a picture of a piece of toast on the show because he is done.
[03:03:30.267 --> 03:03:31.128]  Stick a fork in him.
[03:03:32.489 --> 03:03:33.371]  How long until he's gone?
[03:03:33.711 --> 03:03:34.032]  March.
[03:03:34.553 --> 03:03:36.336]  I say he's gone by March.
[03:03:36.476 --> 03:03:37.598]  Let me ask you this just briefly.
[03:03:37.618 --> 03:03:42.406]  Have you heard anything about military strikes in the March, early April against North Korea?
[03:03:43.562 --> 03:03:48.866]  You know, the narrative, I believe, is exactly the opposite of what the media keeps trying to tell us.
[03:03:48.886 --> 03:03:54.850]  They keep saying, Trump's a madman, he wants to go to war, the generals are trying to restrain him.
[03:03:55.111 --> 03:03:56.872]  It's the other way around, folks.
[03:03:57.212 --> 03:04:00.114]  It's the president who's saying, look, they only respond to tough talk.
[03:04:00.535 --> 03:04:01.535]  Yeah, I'm beating him up.
[03:04:01.595 --> 03:04:02.716]  Notice they're at the table.
[03:04:02.836 --> 03:04:04.518]  The last thing he wants is a war.
[03:04:04.878 --> 03:04:10.482]  But he's using peace through strength, the Eisenhower-Reagan approach to these guys, and guess what?
[03:04:10.902 --> 03:04:11.483]  It's working.
[03:04:12.605 --> 03:04:14.665]  Look at the craziness of the North Korean government.
[03:04:14.725 --> 03:04:17.266]  I mean, that is authoritarianism on display.
[03:04:17.286 --> 03:04:24.167]  A bunch of starving, skinny people with a big, fat, spoiled, rotten, nobody, hereditary dictator running it all with a bad haircut.
[03:04:24.608 --> 03:04:26.408]  That is a disgusting little haircut.
[03:04:26.688 --> 03:04:27.768]  I mean, what the hell?
[03:04:28.248 --> 03:04:32.489]  Even his sister is, like, starving to death, and he's this giant, bloated person dying of obesity.
[03:04:33.069 --> 03:04:33.930]  It's very archetypal.
[03:04:34.170 --> 03:04:35.170]  Hey, will you cover then?
[03:04:36.070 --> 03:04:37.932]  Well, you just said the start of the war room in an hour.
[03:04:38.312 --> 03:04:38.512]  Yes.
[03:04:38.552 --> 03:04:42.236]  Because I want you and Anthony Comey of Compound Media doing a great jobs coming up next.
[03:04:42.616 --> 03:04:43.577]  Commamedia.com.
[03:04:44.458 --> 03:04:47.521]  Because, absolutely, Trump's got him to the table.
[03:04:47.541 --> 03:04:48.241]  He gets no credit.
[03:04:48.662 --> 03:04:51.144]  We know, well, talk about it all coming up in five minutes.
[03:04:51.544 --> 03:04:56.809]  Anthony Comey is straight ahead and then the war room with Owen Stroyer and Roger Stone from the ATX Worldwide.
[03:04:57.350 --> 03:04:59.772]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.

[03:06:08.614 --> 03:06:10.175]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:10.635 --> 03:06:15.758]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Anthony Cumia.
[03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:20.801]  Welcome everybody.
[03:06:20.921 --> 03:06:21.641]  Welcome.
[03:06:21.721 --> 03:06:25.344]  Anthony Cumia in here at Infowars.com.
[03:06:25.504 --> 03:06:26.264]  Oh my goodness.
[03:06:27.205 --> 03:06:27.965]  Oh my goodness.
[03:06:28.025 --> 03:06:33.628]  Yes, we've had another school shooting and it's terrible.
[03:06:34.289 --> 03:06:34.969]  It's terrible.
[03:06:35.529 --> 03:06:36.150]  No one
[03:06:36.952 --> 03:06:39.473]  Denies that these things are terrible.
[03:06:40.993 --> 03:06:44.694]  Social media just becomes a light.
[03:06:45.414 --> 03:06:48.155]  With people just, you know, we team up.
[03:06:48.735 --> 03:06:49.796]  We got our phones.
[03:06:50.516 --> 03:06:51.256]  What happens?
[03:06:51.336 --> 03:06:52.256]  School shooting.
[03:06:52.296 --> 03:06:53.197]  Let me get my team!
[03:06:53.217 --> 03:06:54.797]  Let me get on my team!
[03:06:55.377 --> 03:07:02.479]  And I gotta do the basic rah-rah cheers for my team and bash the other team.
[03:07:02.499 --> 03:07:04.440]  Now, of course, the teams
[03:07:06.344 --> 03:07:14.127]  Are the left, the right, the Democrats, Republicans, Conservatives, Liberals, whatever you want to call them, the usual suspects, those are our teams.
[03:07:15.327 --> 03:07:31.193]  One side, when these tragedies happen, blames the other side for inaction and actually says that there's blood on their hands and whatever their stance is,
[03:07:32.864 --> 03:07:36.866]  It has directly contributed to the deaths of children.
[03:07:37.266 --> 03:07:42.789]  Thus, then, they must want dead children.
[03:07:44.410 --> 03:07:58.736]  Because in this great age of social media and instant communication with our brethren, we take things from zero to eight billion in three seconds flat.
[03:08:01.005 --> 03:08:04.086]  It goes from, oh my God, there was a school shooting.
[03:08:04.466 --> 03:08:05.847]  Well, we still have a Second Amendment.
[03:08:06.007 --> 03:08:07.607]  You won't kill children!
[03:08:10.148 --> 03:08:13.609]  And it goes from, oh my God, there was a school shooting.
[03:08:13.889 --> 03:08:15.010]  Maybe we should do something.
[03:08:15.170 --> 03:08:16.590]  Confiscating my weapons!
[03:08:17.571 --> 03:08:18.611]  Like, it's just...
[03:08:19.412 --> 03:08:22.393]  We have no middle ground here whatsoever.
[03:08:22.954 --> 03:08:31.318]  We separate into our respective teams and just start throwing crap at each other.
[03:08:32.818 --> 03:08:39.982]  And in the long run, and this will prove no different, in the long run you will see nothing.
[03:08:40.562 --> 03:08:41.482]  Nothing will happen.
[03:08:42.643 --> 03:08:44.684]  A week or so will go by, if that.
[03:08:45.204 --> 03:08:47.445]  A story these days, if it goes a week, whoo!
[03:08:48.408 --> 03:08:48.648]  Woo!
[03:08:49.208 --> 03:08:57.490]  Unless it's like Trump stuff and the actual mass media, the news and whatnot, gets a hold of it.
[03:08:57.930 --> 03:08:59.690]  Then it could last a while.
[03:08:59.710 --> 03:09:00.390]  It has legs.
[03:09:00.890 --> 03:09:07.572]  Important things like this Russian collusion that apparently no one has seen any evidence of.
[03:09:08.032 --> 03:09:10.852]  But that kind of stuff will go on and on.
[03:09:11.072 --> 03:09:13.873]  But as far as what we talk about, the people,
[03:09:14.531 --> 03:09:15.832]  Talk about on social media.
[03:09:16.232 --> 03:09:19.075]  If a story lasts a week, it was a biggie.
[03:09:19.655 --> 03:09:30.163]  Because usually within two days, and if you throw a weekend in there, something could happen Friday, you throw a weekend in there, by Monday, no one remembers it, no one cares, it's over, Johnny.
[03:09:31.784 --> 03:09:33.946]  So when you get a school shooting like this, it's huge.
[03:09:34.326 --> 03:09:35.047]  For a couple of days.
[03:09:35.988 --> 03:09:45.591]  And like I said, we pair off into our teams, we sling crap at each other's heads, and then we move on to the next thing, like locusts.
[03:09:46.091 --> 03:09:52.413]  We're like locusts, just destroying what's in our path and moving on to something else.
[03:09:54.674 --> 03:09:56.335]  And in that mess,
[03:09:58.221 --> 03:10:06.667]  Of social media, you pick out little nuggets of truth and a lot of nuggets of dishonesty and agenda and whatnot.
[03:10:06.767 --> 03:10:09.448]  So, let's talk a little about this.
[03:10:09.869 --> 03:10:12.610]  This horrific shooting.
[03:10:15.072 --> 03:10:24.098]  First and foremost, I think, you could not possibly have more red flags than have popped up with this guy.
[03:10:25.020 --> 03:10:49.706]  The see something, say something, the we need your involvement, the school, law enforcement, social media, parents, friends, parents of friends, all of that, every single thing that happened in this case was a red flag that literally said, he literally said, I am going to shoot up a school.
[03:10:50.986 --> 03:10:54.507]  That to me is more than a red flag.
[03:10:55.695 --> 03:10:57.175]  A red flag you have to interpret.
[03:10:57.515 --> 03:11:01.356]  That is a flag with I'm gonna shoot up a school written on the actual flag.
[03:11:02.256 --> 03:11:04.617]  If he did that, which I wouldn't be surprised if it came out.
[03:11:04.917 --> 03:11:06.757]  If he marched around the school with a flag.
[03:11:07.598 --> 03:11:11.038]  But apparently he was on social media threatening to shoot up the school.
[03:11:12.199 --> 03:11:18.000]  He was expelled for his behavior in school or lack thereof.
[03:11:19.748 --> 03:11:27.532]  And everyone that knew of him in the school said, oh yeah, this guy's nuts, he'll probably shoot up the school.
[03:11:28.832 --> 03:11:40.518]  He was, one report that I have gotten says that the FBI was informed on a couple of occasions that this kid was probably a problem.
[03:11:42.019 --> 03:11:45.460]  FBI and teachers warned about Nicholas Cruz.
[03:11:46.561 --> 03:11:48.862]  And still, nothing was done.
[03:11:50.076 --> 03:11:56.380]  Um, I guess when he was attending school, uh, he had been banned from entering the school with a backpack.
[03:11:57.141 --> 03:12:01.464]  Which now kinda tells me, hey, they're afraid he's gonna bring something in.
[03:12:03.205 --> 03:12:04.265]  And- and hurt people.
[03:12:05.846 --> 03:12:07.207]  But nothing was done.
[03:12:08.348 --> 03:12:14.192]  So, again, we default to... Uh, the hardware he used.
[03:12:14.212 --> 03:12:15.573]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the guns.
[03:12:16.673 --> 03:12:17.274]  The gun.
[03:12:18.835 --> 03:12:18.935]  Um...
[03:12:20.481 --> 03:12:25.665]  Whenever things like this happen, we run to the gun and say, ah, that's the problem.
[03:12:25.705 --> 03:12:26.526]  That's what's doing it.
[03:12:27.147 --> 03:12:32.331]  If we just get rid of the guns, no one will want to kill anyone anymore.
[03:12:32.951 --> 03:12:36.314]  Or if we just get rid of certain guns, right?
[03:12:36.814 --> 03:12:40.578]  Because there are guns, I guess, that don't put holes in people?
[03:12:41.258 --> 03:12:42.259]  Is that what I'm led to believe?
[03:12:42.879 --> 03:12:43.480]  No?
[03:12:43.980 --> 03:12:44.341]  Oh.
[03:12:44.681 --> 03:12:48.404]  My staff is telling me, no, most guns do put holes in people.
[03:12:49.185 --> 03:12:50.366]  Regardless of their type.
[03:12:51.727 --> 03:13:08.662]  I mean, after the break we'll talk a little more about the certain types of guns, but just the idea that the gun is the actual focal point of the left, Democrats, they want what they call
[03:13:09.971 --> 03:13:12.712]  Common sense gun control.
[03:13:13.312 --> 03:13:14.432]  Common sense gun law.
[03:13:14.452 --> 03:13:15.312]  Because look at this guy.
[03:13:15.772 --> 03:13:20.654]  He, uh, him and his actions, uh, they just reek of common sense, don't they?
[03:13:21.094 --> 03:13:25.015]  Doesn't that look like a guy that would follow his common sense?
[03:13:26.155 --> 03:13:29.216]  Again, uh, no one seems to understand on the left.
[03:13:30.396 --> 03:13:35.357]  Seems to understand that laws and, uh, living in a civilized society
[03:13:36.178 --> 03:13:48.888]  Treating people the way you want to be treated, having emotions, empathy, sympathy, other kinds of if-these, it's not in them.
[03:13:49.528 --> 03:13:51.930]  That is why they do these things.
[03:13:52.991 --> 03:13:55.653]  They don't have common sense.
[03:13:56.873 --> 03:14:01.177]  So they wouldn't follow common sense gun laws and regulations.
[03:14:01.737 --> 03:14:05.380]  This guy had one mission, to kill as many people
[03:14:06.631 --> 03:14:08.752]  Uh, that were in front of him in that school.
[03:14:10.233 --> 03:14:15.336]  Now, you could argue that the device he used was, uh, was perfect for that.
[03:14:16.396 --> 03:14:18.478]  A, uh, semi-automatic, uh, rifle.
[03:14:19.398 --> 03:14:22.059]  Perfect if you want to, uh, kill, um, a lot of people.
[03:14:23.060 --> 03:14:35.847]  Uh, but then again, it is a tool, it is used by many other people, uh, correctly, um, by law enforcement, by people that want to defend themselves and their loved ones, by people that are hunting,
[03:14:36.650 --> 03:14:40.351]  And by people that want to make sure the government doesn't get out of hand.
[03:14:41.032 --> 03:14:46.833]  These are all people that would use this tool in the way it was designated to use.
[03:14:47.314 --> 03:14:55.716]  Unfortunately, a maniac with no common sense will misuse that tool and take many lives.
[03:14:56.397 --> 03:14:57.977]  The problem isn't the tool.
[03:14:57.997 --> 03:15:03.239]  The problem is figuring out why this guy snapped and why the other people snapped.
[03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:06.481]  That, uh, do such things.
[03:15:07.201 --> 03:15:15.546]  Because, uh, call me crazy, but I honestly believe if there were no guns, these people would find a way to kill people.
[03:15:16.066 --> 03:15:24.431]  They've done it in the past with the automobiles, bombs, whatever else it takes, uh, to, uh, end a life.
[03:15:25.151 --> 03:15:28.413]  If someone wants to do just that, they will find a way.
[03:15:28.533 --> 03:15:30.634]  And again, it's a very convenient way.
[03:15:31.303 --> 03:15:35.126]  But a hammer is a very convenient way of hammering in nails.
[03:15:36.087 --> 03:15:38.409]  And in the hand of a carpenter, it works wonders.
[03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:41.892]  In the hand of a maniac, he will crack in people's skulls with it.
[03:15:42.293 --> 03:15:46.476]  It doesn't mean the tool is designed poorly or should be restricted to people.
[03:15:47.477 --> 03:15:50.460]  A woman beats her boyfriend to death with two frying pans.
[03:15:51.104 --> 03:15:51.544]  That's good.
[03:15:52.225 --> 03:15:57.029]  I hope she cooked him some eggs before she bludgeoned him with those tools.
[03:15:57.269 --> 03:16:01.213]  We'll be back, but we'll be talking about this, this Florida massacre.
[03:16:01.473 --> 03:16:06.197]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globals, but they're striking back all over the world.
[03:16:06.477 --> 03:16:12.022]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[03:16:12.122 --> 03:16:21.169]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[03:16:21.329 --> 03:16:29.156]  So go to fortifiedsupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[03:16:29.256 --> 03:16:30.937]  That's fortifiedsupply.com.
[03:16:36.616 --> 03:16:38.578]  Can you beat Oprah, by the way?
[03:16:38.618 --> 03:16:39.579]  Yeah, I'll beat Oprah.
[03:16:39.679 --> 03:16:41.621]  Oprah would be a lot of fun.
[03:16:41.701 --> 03:16:42.562]  I know her very well.
[03:16:42.762 --> 03:16:44.304]  You know, I did one of her last shows.
[03:16:44.384 --> 03:16:45.345]  She had Donald Trump.
[03:16:45.365 --> 03:16:46.346]  This was before politics.
[03:16:46.707 --> 03:16:47.487]  Her last week.
[03:16:48.168 --> 03:16:49.950]  And she had Donald Trump and my family.
[03:16:49.990 --> 03:16:50.510]  It was very nice.
[03:16:50.531 --> 03:16:51.411]  So I like Oprah.
[03:16:51.972 --> 03:16:53.413]  I don't think she's gonna run.
[03:16:53.494 --> 03:16:55.075]  I don't think she's gonna run.
[03:16:57.197 --> 03:16:58.737]  I know it very well.
[03:17:18.522 --> 03:17:22.323]  Pimping women, bringing women to Weinstein, all of it.
[03:17:22.343 --> 03:17:23.464]  This is mainstream news.
[03:17:23.844 --> 03:17:27.025]  Let's talk about why you think she's unelectable.
[03:17:27.345 --> 03:17:33.987]  You think of, you know, the identity politics vote, the woman vote, the bitter vote, the millennial vote, the dumb vote.
[03:17:34.328 --> 03:17:38.289]  She's got all of these different votes that end up being more than 50% of the country.
[03:17:38.609 --> 03:17:43.191]  The people who generally have skin in the game and get politics, they're a minority.
[03:17:43.511 --> 03:17:47.032]  So I was kind of scared and then I talked to Roger Stone a second ago and he goes, dude,
[03:17:47.632 --> 03:17:48.232]  Relax!
[03:17:48.633 --> 03:17:51.534]  Can you imagine the kind of skeletons this woman has in her closet?
[03:17:51.874 --> 03:17:53.535]  And then he dropped it, but he's right!
[03:17:53.615 --> 03:17:54.695]  She's a lesbian!
[03:17:54.875 --> 03:18:02.038]  So I just think that Trump was alluding to that, and we've heard stories of her paying off people to hide lesbian affairs.
[03:18:02.738 --> 03:18:06.600]  She tried to hide that her husband was, I mean, her brother was gay, died of AIDS.
[03:18:06.980 --> 03:18:09.781]  She's tried to hide the fact that she didn't really grow up in poverty.
[03:18:10.041 --> 03:18:16.504]  I mean, she's such an obvious liar, and that works for daytime TV, but it won't work in politics, where everything has to be aired out.
[03:18:16.724 --> 03:18:18.084]  She doesn't have a chance in hell.
[03:18:18.344 --> 03:18:22.966]  And when we watch the Golden Globes, too, we know Mira Cervino isn't there because she said no.
[03:18:23.486 --> 03:18:26.827]  But everyone else, you look at them and you go, well, you're here.
[03:18:27.087 --> 03:18:27.967]  Did you say yes?
[03:18:28.007 --> 03:18:34.289]  I mean, Salma Hayek pretends she was a victim, but she did the lesbian scene in the movie for Weinstein.
[03:18:34.509 --> 03:18:36.570]  All these people followed the rules.
[03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:40.451]  And now after they've done this, which is really just very expensive prostitution,
[03:18:40.851 --> 03:18:44.292]  They put on their low-slung black dresses and go, me too.
[03:18:44.672 --> 03:18:45.352]  It's over now.
[03:18:45.392 --> 03:18:47.253]  I'm gonna stop being an expensive prostitute.
[03:18:47.573 --> 03:18:48.813]  No, sorry, it doesn't work like that.
[03:18:48.853 --> 03:18:50.614]  You can't get on your high horse when it's fashionable.
[03:18:50.734 --> 03:18:52.894]  Look, we know what Time's Up means.
[03:18:53.435 --> 03:19:00.717]  It means I knew, we all knew, we let it go, but now the jig is up and everyone can see the casting couch.
[03:19:00.997 --> 03:19:04.718]  So starting today, we're not going to popularize it anymore.
[03:19:04.758 --> 03:19:05.798]  We're not going to ignore it.
[03:19:06.178 --> 03:19:07.580]  Ooh, how brave!
[03:19:07.920 --> 03:19:13.707]  You let a thousand rapes go under the radar, and starting today, you say time's up!
[03:19:14.007 --> 03:19:16.090]  You're not going to allow rape anymore because it went public?
[03:19:16.570 --> 03:19:16.971]  Wow!
[03:19:17.331 --> 03:19:19.594]  What a crusader for justice you are!
[03:19:19.854 --> 03:19:21.977]  We're so impressed, you feminists!
[03:19:22.297 --> 03:19:23.118]  You want to get raped?
[03:19:23.358 --> 03:19:24.219]  You want to get abused?
[03:19:24.380 --> 03:19:25.241]  You want to get killed?
[03:19:25.481 --> 03:19:26.182]  Go to Hollywood!
[03:19:31.829 --> 03:19:39.052]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:19:39.532 --> 03:19:48.677]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[03:19:48.957 --> 03:19:54.059]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[03:19:54.339 --> 03:19:57.180]  It also funds the InfoWars, a total 360 win.
[03:19:57.621 --> 03:20:00.422]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:20:05.635 --> 03:20:08.417]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.362 --> 03:20:23.926]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.427 --> 03:20:27.689]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:20:30.450 --> 03:20:34.511]  Limited time sale on Cell Force by InfoWars Life.
[03:20:34.871 --> 03:20:36.291]  53% off discount, $69.95.
[03:20:36.792 --> 03:20:46.214]  Several years ago, we teamed up with Dr. Group to create DNA Force and other incredible InfoWars Life formulas because they had outstanding standards.
[03:20:46.694 --> 03:20:50.915]  After a few years of delivering these powerful formulas, we wanted to improve on DNA Force.
[03:20:51.355 --> 03:20:55.757]  And it's Bio PQQ formula to help you get the best for less.
[03:20:55.997 --> 03:21:03.239]  We found a way to make it stronger and more affordable version, but didn't want to compete against Dr. Group and his amazing team.
[03:21:03.620 --> 03:21:06.661]  After consulting with him and his team, Group gave us the go-ahead.
[03:21:07.081 --> 03:21:12.523]  He only wants us to be able to provide our listeners with the greatest high quality and most affordable products possible.
[03:21:12.803 --> 03:21:15.684]  That's how we came up about making Cell Force.
[03:21:16.264 --> 03:21:18.886]  Because Dr. Group is making room for more of his products.
[03:21:19.266 --> 03:21:24.370]  We turned DNA Force Plus into a powerful new formula that utilizes the best ingredients possible.
[03:21:24.750 --> 03:21:28.693]  Other formulas with these ingredients would cost up to, oh, 300 bucks!
[03:21:29.373 --> 03:21:33.536]  But we wanted to bring you that quality of product for a lot less.
[03:21:34.037 --> 03:21:39.601]  While we would normally put this out at about $150, I believe, we're gonna even lower it to $69.95.
[03:21:41.932 --> 03:21:43.433]  This is the last batch of Cell Force.
[03:21:43.533 --> 03:21:45.914]  After this, it's going to become DNA Force+.
[03:21:46.435 --> 03:21:50.517]  If you like DNA Force, then there's no better time to try its upgrade.
[03:21:50.897 --> 03:21:55.540]  After this run of Cell Force, we'll be relabeling it to its true name, DNA Force+.
[03:21:55.780 --> 03:21:59.983]  Grab your bottle today and feel the power of a new Bio PQQ formula.
[03:22:00.904 --> 03:22:01.424]  I'm telling ya.
[03:22:02.369 --> 03:22:03.509]  It's what you gotta do, peeps.
[03:22:04.109 --> 03:22:04.650]  Welcome back.
[03:22:04.730 --> 03:22:07.050]  Anthony Comia in at Infowars.com.
[03:22:07.270 --> 03:22:15.332]  We're talking about the Florida school shooting and, of course, the repercussions the day after.
[03:22:15.352 --> 03:22:16.172]  Oh, my God.
[03:22:16.212 --> 03:22:20.693]  Everyone takes to social media to just yell, to just yell at each other.
[03:22:21.253 --> 03:22:24.934]  And again, a week will go by, if that, and nothing will get done.
[03:22:25.094 --> 03:22:29.575]  And we will be more divided and hate each other even more.
[03:22:30.959 --> 03:22:31.880]  Thank goodness for that.
[03:22:33.600 --> 03:22:35.041]  So what we hear is, ah, the guns.
[03:22:35.381 --> 03:22:36.601]  That's what one side says.
[03:22:37.062 --> 03:22:37.622]  Ah, the guns.
[03:22:38.162 --> 03:22:43.124]  We gotta ban guns, especially these AR-15s.
[03:22:44.064 --> 03:22:50.007]  And then you read, and people think AR stands for Assault Rifle, and it doesn't.
[03:22:50.047 --> 03:22:52.988]  Whoever says that, I just can't listen to your conversation.
[03:22:53.679 --> 03:23:05.271]  I have never seen a group of people so adamant about a topic, so passionate about a topic, like gun control, that know absolutely nothing about guns.
[03:23:06.052 --> 03:23:14.681]  I would assume you would want to do a little research and find out what types of guns there are and how they're used legally by people.
[03:23:15.791 --> 03:23:17.112]  The mechanics of some of them.
[03:23:17.332 --> 03:23:28.000]  You don't have to be a gunsmith, but Jesus, know at least something about firearms before you go spouting off about which ones should be banned and why.
[03:23:28.481 --> 03:23:32.684]  These are military-grade weapons that shouldn't be in the hands of civilians.
[03:23:34.345 --> 03:23:44.613]  I hope this isn't too technical for people, but the AR-15 is used to kill a lot of people in the shortest amount of time.
[03:23:45.507 --> 03:23:48.590]  It's a tool, and that is indeed what it is used for.
[03:23:50.032 --> 03:23:50.652]  Or hunting.
[03:23:50.693 --> 03:23:54.757]  People do hunt with AR-15s, contrary to some people's beliefs.
[03:23:56.338 --> 03:24:02.565]  It is a semi-automatic, which means you need to pull the trigger for every single shot.
[03:24:03.525 --> 03:24:13.252]  Every time a bullet flies out of the end, it means the guy holding it, or girl, perish the thought, I'm sexist, had to pull the trigger.
[03:24:13.772 --> 03:24:14.533]  That's how it works.
[03:24:14.773 --> 03:24:23.619]  It's not a machine gun, it's not full automatic, and it's not a military, the version of what the military uses in civilian hands.
[03:24:24.059 --> 03:24:25.840]  It is a semi-automatic rifle.
[03:24:26.201 --> 03:24:31.564]  Semi-automatic rifles have been available to the general public since probably the early 1900s.
[03:24:33.408 --> 03:24:35.329]  If you remember those days, I do personally.
[03:24:36.690 --> 03:24:40.292]  Uh, no, of course I don't, but they've been around for quite a while.
[03:24:40.312 --> 03:24:52.358]  Uh, a lot of them, many of them that act, that perform exactly like your AR-15, uh, look much different.
[03:24:52.738 --> 03:24:53.958]  They look like hunting rifles.
[03:24:54.799 --> 03:25:00.702]  There is a rifle, uh, an M1 carbine, or carbine, depending on how you want to pronounce it.
[03:25:02.246 --> 03:25:06.547]  It is a prime example of a rifle that looks like a hunting rifle.
[03:25:06.927 --> 03:25:14.650]  It doesn't look like the black plastic military look of a rifle these days, like an AR-15.
[03:25:16.010 --> 03:25:18.571]  But it fires exactly the same.
[03:25:19.511 --> 03:25:20.731]  It fires the same round.
[03:25:22.192 --> 03:25:24.032]  It fires as fast as you pull the trigger.
[03:25:24.692 --> 03:25:29.714]  It has a detachable magazine that can be filled with ammunition and popped in.
[03:25:30.814 --> 03:25:38.836]  Yet these are not on this wide ban list that a lot of these liberals want.
[03:25:39.196 --> 03:25:41.556]  That indeed is considered an assault rifle, by the way.
[03:25:41.996 --> 03:25:44.597]  There are other ones that aren't, that don't have the pistol grip.
[03:25:45.237 --> 03:25:53.859]  See, if you have a pistol grip and a detachable mag in a lot of states, including New York, that would be considered an assault rifle.
[03:25:55.579 --> 03:25:58.580]  But there are ones that just have a stock.
[03:25:59.941 --> 03:26:03.242]  And that indeed, again, would be an assault rifle.
[03:26:04.282 --> 03:26:05.662]  Considered an assault rifle.
[03:26:05.962 --> 03:26:07.343]  I don't consider them assault rifles.
[03:26:07.783 --> 03:26:09.623]  I consider them semi-automatic rifles.
[03:26:10.263 --> 03:26:14.544]  Because they are exactly the same as the other ones, with just a wooden stock.
[03:26:14.944 --> 03:26:18.765]  You're all granddad's Garand from World War II.
[03:26:19.225 --> 03:26:20.305]  How about that?
[03:26:21.486 --> 03:26:23.046]  But they do the same thing.
[03:26:23.086 --> 03:26:25.486]  They fire as quickly as you can pull the trigger.
[03:26:26.407 --> 03:26:28.227]  Now, do you ban those?
[03:26:29.207 --> 03:26:31.149]  And then we get to the point I was making before.
[03:26:31.729 --> 03:26:34.671]  Do we get to the point where we get guns that don't put holes in people?
[03:26:35.292 --> 03:26:41.416]  And then those are okay, but everything else... I've been told, oh, stop with the slippery slope argument.
[03:26:42.357 --> 03:26:42.877]  But it is.
[03:26:43.618 --> 03:26:48.481]  There is a bottom line endgame here for a lot of people on the left.
[03:26:48.822 --> 03:26:51.924]  And that is absolute gun confiscation.
[03:26:53.105 --> 03:26:55.947]  The elimination of your Second Amendment right.
[03:26:57.279 --> 03:27:01.722]  And that is the only way they can fathom saving the children.
[03:27:02.202 --> 03:27:16.529]  They use these school shootings as much as the other side will, to defend people having guns and carrying concealed, being allowed to carry in these no-gun zones, which are absolutely ridiculous.
[03:27:16.970 --> 03:27:24.894]  So both sides will fight each other, both sides will blame each other for the dead kids, and nothing gets accomplished.
[03:27:25.467 --> 03:27:28.289]  Because we are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum.
[03:27:28.569 --> 03:27:32.050]  But again, I honestly don't think anyone wants dead children.
[03:27:32.851 --> 03:27:35.812]  I think that's where the middle ground is between the two sides.
[03:27:36.453 --> 03:27:37.353]  Hey, can we agree?
[03:27:37.733 --> 03:27:41.375]  No one wants children lying dead on schoolroom floors.
[03:27:41.816 --> 03:27:42.096]  Anyone?
[03:27:42.116 --> 03:27:42.936]  Do we have a show of hands?
[03:27:43.336 --> 03:27:44.337]  Oh look, it's everybody.
[03:27:45.678 --> 03:27:46.358]  How do we do that?
[03:27:46.698 --> 03:27:48.159]  Ah, then you get the craziness.
[03:27:49.543 --> 03:27:57.452]  I think there are a lot of ways to at least cut down on the probability that this will happen.
[03:27:57.792 --> 03:27:58.793]  Eliminate it totally?
[03:27:59.133 --> 03:27:59.434]  Stop.
[03:27:59.954 --> 03:28:00.335]  Stop it.
[03:28:01.215 --> 03:28:04.399]  We'll post unicorns at the school doors.
[03:28:05.197 --> 03:28:10.699]  And the unicorn will spear the bad guy with his pretty glittery unicorn horn.
[03:28:11.159 --> 03:28:19.722]  You're talking about a utopia that can never exist as long as human beings are the animals that we are.
[03:28:20.182 --> 03:28:21.402]  So don't look for that.
[03:28:21.762 --> 03:28:23.543]  Don't look for an absolute solution.
[03:28:24.143 --> 03:28:33.646]  But there are certain things that can be done that I think should at least satisfy some sane people on both sides of this argument.
[03:28:34.623 --> 03:28:39.845]  And we'll talk about those in a couple of minutes when we come back around from this break.
[03:28:40.906 --> 03:28:42.866]  I, indeed, am Anthony Cumia.
[03:28:43.107 --> 03:28:45.688]  This, indeed, is Infowars.com.
[03:28:47.208 --> 03:28:48.809]  And we'll be back in a matter of moments.
[03:28:49.209 --> 03:28:51.330]  Did I start the break a little too soon?
[03:28:51.430 --> 03:28:51.630]  Did I?
[03:29:01.903 --> 03:29:05.004]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:29:05.405 --> 03:29:16.449]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[03:29:16.949 --> 03:29:17.870]  This is Pollen Block.
[03:29:18.870 --> 03:29:31.145]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[03:29:31.606 --> 03:29:35.451]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[03:29:35.911 --> 03:29:39.955]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[03:29:40.416 --> 03:29:50.066]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[03:29:50.567 --> 03:29:53.410]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block.
[03:29:53.710 --> 03:29:57.875]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free.

[03:30:01.836 --> 03:30:09.559]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:30:10.400 --> 03:30:14.461]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:30:14.961 --> 03:30:17.302]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:30:18.103 --> 03:30:21.224]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:30:22.731 --> 03:30:34.877]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:30:35.558 --> 03:30:50.626]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:30:51.607 --> 03:30:55.336]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[03:30:55.897 --> 03:30:57.601]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:30:57.641 --> 03:30:59.886]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[03:31:03.718 --> 03:31:22.009]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:31:22.109 --> 03:31:27.533]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:31:28.393 --> 03:31:29.074]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:31:29.514 --> 03:31:32.356]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[03:31:32.996 --> 03:31:33.957]  And so much more.
[03:31:34.537 --> 03:31:35.678]  It is concentrated.
[03:31:35.899 --> 03:31:37.600]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:31:37.620 --> 03:31:43.325]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:31:43.425 --> 03:31:44.626]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:31:44.646 --> 03:31:46.587]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:31:46.667 --> 03:31:49.029]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:31:49.249 --> 03:31:50.510]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:31:50.691 --> 03:31:52.492]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:31:53.052 --> 03:31:53.653]  Immune Wall.
[03:31:53.773 --> 03:31:55.074]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:55.194 --> 03:31:56.375]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:32:06.345 --> 03:32:09.446]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:32:09.486 --> 03:32:10.006]  You're on the air.
[03:32:10.026 --> 03:32:11.166]  Thanks for holding.
[03:32:11.206 --> 03:32:12.047]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:32:12.267 --> 03:32:12.667]  Hey, brother.
[03:32:12.687 --> 03:32:12.847]  Sir.
[03:32:13.167 --> 03:32:13.527]  Good, man.
[03:32:13.547 --> 03:32:14.347]  Thank you for calling.
[03:32:14.427 --> 03:32:14.627]  Hey.
[03:32:14.687 --> 03:32:14.947]  Hey.
[03:32:14.967 --> 03:32:19.489]  Um, I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:32:19.709 --> 03:32:26.090]  Um, I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:32:26.211 --> 03:32:27.511]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[03:32:27.711 --> 03:32:34.813]  Um, Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, um, take a shot of that.
[03:32:35.213 --> 03:32:36.434]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:32:36.494 --> 03:32:38.936]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[03:32:38.996 --> 03:32:40.517]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:32:40.897 --> 03:32:42.539]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:32:42.959 --> 03:32:43.680]  And exactly.
[03:32:43.700 --> 03:32:48.043]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:32:48.303 --> 03:32:48.563]  Boom!
[03:32:48.703 --> 03:32:51.546]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:32:51.606 --> 03:32:52.126]  It's amazing.
[03:32:52.186 --> 03:32:53.467]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[03:32:53.567 --> 03:32:56.429]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:33:05.203 --> 03:33:16.187]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.608 --> 03:33:22.509]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:33:22.969 --> 03:33:26.891]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:27.371 --> 03:33:30.632]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:33:34.334 --> 03:33:35.575]  Uh, hello everybody.
[03:33:35.735 --> 03:33:36.455]  Welcome back.
[03:33:36.915 --> 03:33:38.796]  Anthony Comey and Infowars.com.
[03:33:39.577 --> 03:33:41.037]  Uh, well, solutions.
[03:33:41.117 --> 03:33:41.998]  People want solutions.
[03:33:42.018 --> 03:33:42.698]  They want answers.
[03:33:42.778 --> 03:33:44.819]  Why did these school shootings happen?
[03:33:45.660 --> 03:33:47.160]  Why weren't they happening years ago?
[03:33:47.180 --> 03:33:47.941]  Blah, blah.
[03:33:47.961 --> 03:33:49.902]  You just keep hearing the same stories.
[03:33:50.642 --> 03:33:54.444]  Uh, you go to social media, it's the same arguments back and forth, back and forth.
[03:33:55.124 --> 03:33:59.846]  Um, I think, again, maybe if we look at our past a little bit.
[03:34:00.587 --> 03:34:00.667]  Um,
[03:34:02.159 --> 03:34:09.904]  We like to treat people these days like everyone is this special, special individual snowflake.
[03:34:10.664 --> 03:34:12.766]  And how dare you?
[03:34:14.075 --> 03:34:35.126]  Uh, tell them that no matter how ridiculous they're acting, how insane sounding they are, um, that they're special and should be given the opportunity to express themselves and, and all this, uh, garbage, um, that we've heard over the past, uh, 30 progressive years.
[03:34:36.066 --> 03:34:43.070]  Uh, and the bottom line is, as I knew growing up, some people are just idiots.
[03:34:44.076 --> 03:34:46.241]  And some people are just nuts.
[03:34:47.624 --> 03:34:52.374]  And that seems to be a constant in our little universe.
[03:34:53.917 --> 03:35:06.381]  But instead of treating them like that, and going like, hey, be careful around that guy, you know, they have to be treated with kid gloves and coddled.
[03:35:06.921 --> 03:35:21.045]  The coddling that has gone on over the course of a few decades these days has sprung up a crop of kids and young adults that are mental patients
[03:35:21.855 --> 03:35:23.716]  Legitimately mental patients.
[03:35:25.437 --> 03:35:29.379]  We didn't hear about these things many, many years ago in schools.
[03:35:30.519 --> 03:35:32.780]  The community was involved with schools back then.
[03:35:33.941 --> 03:35:36.722]  Parents, a good family structure.
[03:35:37.982 --> 03:35:41.344]  Those were the things that were involved in schools.
[03:35:42.164 --> 03:35:47.427]  The administrators and teachers took more of a part in
[03:35:48.947 --> 03:35:57.414]  The individual students' lives, not just this mass thing that are the students.
[03:35:57.974 --> 03:36:05.701]  Oh, we got to usher them through and get them to the next grade level and then shove their asses out the door and get the next group in.
[03:36:07.162 --> 03:36:14.749]  There isn't that individuality anymore where you can really look and see if there are any issues that need to be addressed.
[03:36:15.740 --> 03:36:18.001]  And again, this kid, wow, issues.
[03:36:18.781 --> 03:36:19.822]  Every red flag went up.
[03:36:20.682 --> 03:36:23.203]  So, uh, Michael Ian Black.
[03:36:24.203 --> 03:36:26.744]  He's, uh, I honestly don't know what he is.
[03:36:26.904 --> 03:36:28.225]  I've seen him on a couple of things.
[03:36:28.565 --> 03:36:31.566]  He professes himself to be a comic, I gather.
[03:36:33.007 --> 03:36:39.209]  But, uh, he's saying, deeper even than the gun problem, is this.
[03:36:39.789 --> 03:36:41.090]  Boys are broken.
[03:36:42.210 --> 03:36:43.111]  Boys are broken.
[03:36:43.271 --> 03:36:43.791]  We're broken.
[03:36:44.716 --> 03:36:48.539]  Michael Ian Black pens powerful thread on violence and masculinity.
[03:36:49.260 --> 03:36:53.343]  After Florida shooting, boys are broken.
[03:36:53.363 --> 03:36:56.125]  Why, why would you think boys are broken?
[03:36:56.885 --> 03:37:05.032]  If that is indeed an issue that Michael Ian Black is saying contributes to things like we just saw yesterday in Florida, these shootings.
[03:37:05.592 --> 03:37:10.756]  I profess to you, if indeed boys are broken, you're the ones breaking them!
[03:37:11.611 --> 03:37:17.593]  Every damn day we're hearing about how horrible straight white men are.
[03:37:17.613 --> 03:37:20.274]  You hear how awful they are?
[03:37:22.115 --> 03:37:39.282]  Our society for decades now has just been pushing this lump of crap on masculinity and on men and their ability to act like men.
[03:37:40.831 --> 03:37:42.613]  And you become disenfranchised.
[03:37:43.573 --> 03:37:47.637]  You become like you're feeling like you're some type of pariah.
[03:37:48.117 --> 03:37:53.622]  You're gonna lash out, especially if you're already half a psycho, like this idiot.
[03:37:54.643 --> 03:38:02.209]  But if Michael Ian Black thinks that boys are broken, it's because of people like Michael Ian Black and the liberal left.
[03:38:03.280 --> 03:38:10.763]  That has screwed with male identity so bad over decades that they don't even know what bathroom to go into anymore.
[03:38:11.723 --> 03:38:24.809]  They're dressing kids up in dresses at six years old and shooting them up with hormones to make them girls because that day he wanted to be a girl instead of a fireman like he wanted to be the day before.
[03:38:26.629 --> 03:38:28.070]  This insanity
[03:38:29.332 --> 03:38:35.974]  That progressives are telling us is the new humanity is insane.
[03:38:36.934 --> 03:38:56.199]  They are trying to twist millennia of evolution of the male, the human male, and trying to twist it and bend it into something they want instead of something that we've evolved into over the course of hundreds of thousands, if not a million years.
[03:38:57.879 --> 03:39:01.520]  So when you tell boys they're broken, you broke them!
[03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:07.061]  We didn't see this crap in what I call the old days.
[03:39:07.861 --> 03:39:14.963]  Do you know schools many years ago in the 50s, 40s and 50s actually had shooting classes?
[03:39:15.803 --> 03:39:26.006]  Kids brought rifles to school like they would their books and pencils and went into a basement range at certain schools.
[03:39:27.209 --> 03:39:27.909]  And shot!
[03:39:28.150 --> 03:39:29.350]  Had target practice!
[03:39:30.951 --> 03:39:34.872]  And these kids didn't just turn the guns on the students and start shooting!
[03:39:35.853 --> 03:39:38.354]  They were allowed to be men!
[03:39:39.294 --> 03:39:41.555]  They were allowed to be men!
[03:39:42.836 --> 03:39:49.058]  They were allowed to walk up to a girl and tell her she was pretty and address her as she.
[03:39:50.639 --> 03:39:53.660]  They were allowed to ask a girl on a date
[03:39:54.364 --> 03:40:10.375]  And maybe awkwardly fumble for some romance on that night without being crucified and told that they're a pervert and something's wrong with them because they actually want to be in some type of intimate physical relationship with a girl.
[03:40:11.736 --> 03:40:12.756]  Insane!
[03:40:13.297 --> 03:40:13.857]  Broken!
[03:40:14.237 --> 03:40:18.540]  Michael Ian Black and the rest of these Hollywood progressive morons.
[03:40:18.860 --> 03:40:21.082]  Look at this cute little tyke with a rifle!
[03:40:22.523 --> 03:40:24.044]  Look at this adorable little tyke!
[03:40:27.679 --> 03:40:41.143]  But this is like we were allowed to be boys and grow up into men and do things that men have done for thousands of years.
[03:40:42.703 --> 03:40:44.284]  And now that's bad.
[03:40:44.904 --> 03:40:56.327]  And when these younger minds are so twisted by what they're seeing, Michael Ian Black says that they're busted, that somehow they're broken and need to be fixed.
[03:40:57.560 --> 03:41:01.421]  There weren't school shootings when, uh, hey kid, you'll shoot Uriah!
[03:41:02.581 --> 03:41:10.543]  There wasn't... There weren't these school shootings when, uh, kids were, uh, were taking shooting classes in school?
[03:41:12.224 --> 03:41:14.884]  Uh, be allowed to be proud of themselves?
[03:41:15.784 --> 03:41:16.865]  Allowed to be men?
[03:41:17.365 --> 03:41:19.085]  You didn't see this garbage?
[03:41:20.265 --> 03:41:22.226]  But when you're so disillusioned,
[03:41:24.394 --> 03:41:31.638]  And feel like you're the bad guy just for being a guy, then there's going to be a problem.
[03:41:32.698 --> 03:41:36.140]  You're going to get more nut jobs out there.
[03:41:36.560 --> 03:41:38.761]  So Michael Ian Black, go screw!
[03:41:38.781 --> 03:41:46.424]  Oh, it's the same thing over and over with the leftists and Hollywood.
[03:41:47.205 --> 03:41:47.885]  Oh, please.
[03:41:47.965 --> 03:41:48.745]  I've seen it on
[03:41:50.928 --> 03:42:05.915]  Facebook and Twitter, they come out of their gilded cages, crawl out from under their rocks to tell us what we're supposed to do and how we're supposed to protect ourselves and our children.
[03:42:07.215 --> 03:42:10.957]  And what we should use to do that and how we should live our lives.
[03:42:11.677 --> 03:42:12.298]  Shut up!
[03:42:12.918 --> 03:42:19.481]  Just stop criticizing people for wanting to raise their families in a more traditional sense.
[03:42:20.839 --> 03:42:24.163]  For some reason, we have to be tolerant.
[03:42:24.964 --> 03:42:27.167]  And tolerance just means put up with.
[03:42:27.587 --> 03:42:28.208]  Remember that.
[03:42:28.909 --> 03:42:30.090]  Oh, you're not very tolerant.
[03:42:30.331 --> 03:42:31.812]  No, I'm putting up with it.
[03:42:32.493 --> 03:42:33.735]  Tolerant doesn't mean embrace.
[03:42:34.756 --> 03:42:37.940]  It doesn't mean smile and do a dance when you see it.
[03:42:38.934 --> 03:42:40.395]  It just means to tolerate.
[03:42:40.895 --> 03:42:43.956]  You don't have to like it, you gotta tolerate it.
[03:42:44.036 --> 03:42:51.679]  And when Hollywood and the likes of Michael Ian Black come out and start skewing their crap, that's when I've really had it.
[03:42:52.600 --> 03:42:55.901]  And I've had it even more in a few seconds when we return.
[03:42:56.801 --> 03:42:58.062]  Alex Jones Show, Anthony Cook.
[03:43:02.102 --> 03:43:02.823]  I'm so excited.
[03:43:02.843 --> 03:43:12.469]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:43:13.049 --> 03:43:18.233]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:43:18.553 --> 03:43:21.355]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:43:21.575 --> 03:43:30.321]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:43:32.442 --> 03:43:37.226]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:43:37.747 --> 03:43:40.529]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:43:40.649 --> 03:43:51.539]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:43:52.039 --> 03:43:53.340]  It is amazing!
[03:43:54.742 --> 03:43:59.706]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:44:02.399 --> 03:44:06.461]  Brett Smith, author of Thump, The First Hundred Days.
[03:44:07.182 --> 03:44:10.664]  Explain to people about Thump and why this is an important book and how it ties into things.
[03:44:11.044 --> 03:44:13.205]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[03:44:13.365 --> 03:44:18.008]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the president.
[03:44:18.148 --> 03:44:22.955]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[03:44:22.995 --> 03:44:28.863]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable, fluffy little bunny?
[03:44:28.883 --> 03:44:31.627]  It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[03:44:31.667 --> 03:44:32.768]  It's actually hilarious.
[03:44:32.848 --> 03:44:34.330]  I was cracking up reading the whole book.
[03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:35.292]  My wife was cracking up.
[03:44:35.452 --> 03:44:36.593]  And it's a great book for adults.
[03:44:36.613 --> 03:44:37.613]  It's a great book for children.
[03:44:37.653 --> 03:44:39.014]  We're selling the book.
[03:44:39.274 --> 03:44:45.198]  We've got it bundled as well here with a one-off poster that's a collector's item.
[03:44:45.378 --> 03:44:48.619]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the poster are $29.95.
[03:44:48.740 --> 03:44:50.501]  That helps support us.
[03:44:50.741 --> 03:44:51.761]  So get the book, Thump!
[03:44:51.861 --> 03:44:54.083]  The First Hundred Days, and Alex Jones and Thump!
[03:44:54.423 --> 03:44:57.905]  The Art of Infowars for a limited edition at infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:05.962 --> 03:45:12.785]  I started working with some of the top labs in the country many years ago, but intensely the last year, to bring out a lot of new brands.
[03:45:14.266 --> 03:45:23.190]  And I said, what is the cleanest, healthiest thing that goes after seasonal distress, the things that pollen and dust and all the trees and plants cause?
[03:45:24.895 --> 03:45:25.015]  Yeah.
[03:45:43.920 --> 03:45:48.161]  Type of quail, Japanese quail, fed a specific diet by the French.
[03:45:48.781 --> 03:45:50.141]  They discovered this like 40 years ago.
[03:45:50.181 --> 03:45:59.443]  It's not patented, not documented, but it's got better rates in the studies than placebos and then, you know, a lot of other products that are out there.
[03:45:59.463 --> 03:46:04.344]  So I continue to marvel at Mother Nature and what God gave us on this planet.
[03:46:05.884 --> 03:46:11.405]  Because the results we've gotten just at the office, people with serious
[03:46:12.603 --> 03:46:15.105]  Issues with pollen, with dust, you name it.
[03:46:15.545 --> 03:46:18.387]  The results we've gotten with the pollen block have just been insane.
[03:46:19.388 --> 03:46:20.869]  And it just makes my head spin.
[03:46:20.989 --> 03:46:27.774]  Why did I not, suffering from this for so many years, not know about it when it has alleviated
[03:46:28.755 --> 03:46:31.016]  My issues, like I said, 70%.
[03:46:31.377 --> 03:46:34.238]  I mean, it has been a game changer.
[03:46:34.318 --> 03:46:35.499]  I still sneeze some.
[03:46:36.240 --> 03:46:41.563]  I still might have a little burning in my sinus, but the pounding headaches, the fog is gone.
[03:46:42.383 --> 03:46:44.124]  And that's what personally happened for me.
[03:46:44.705 --> 03:46:45.545]  See what happens for you.
[03:46:45.605 --> 03:46:46.266]  Give us your review.
[03:46:46.606 --> 03:46:47.927]  We'd love to hear what you have to say.

[03:49:07.665 --> 03:49:08.205]  That's true.
[03:49:08.485 --> 03:49:09.145]  Welcome back.
[03:49:09.225 --> 03:49:10.066]  Anthony Cumia here.
[03:49:10.306 --> 03:49:12.086]  InfoWars.com.
[03:49:12.846 --> 03:49:16.107]  We were talking about the, of course, the Florida shooting and
[03:49:17.532 --> 03:49:18.693]  Trying to come up with a reason.
[03:49:18.773 --> 03:49:19.834]  Everyone wants a reason.
[03:49:20.415 --> 03:49:22.477]  Everyone wants to know why, why, why did this happen?
[03:49:23.598 --> 03:49:26.201]  Well, Michael Ian Black says that men are broken.
[03:49:26.241 --> 03:49:27.002]  Boys are broken.
[03:49:27.382 --> 03:49:28.403]  And that's why this happened.
[03:49:28.903 --> 03:49:33.428]  And I submit to you, liberal ideology like that has broken boys.
[03:49:33.788 --> 03:49:37.552]  That's the reason why there's so many mental patients.
[03:49:38.193 --> 03:49:40.235]  No one even knows how to act like a man anymore.
[03:49:40.855 --> 03:49:43.277]  And here's a prime example of something.
[03:49:43.357 --> 03:49:44.198]  I'll do this quickly.
[03:49:44.838 --> 03:49:51.222]  Mom outraged after daughter was told she can't say no to boys at a dance.
[03:49:51.823 --> 03:49:54.985]  This is how dances go in school now, people.
[03:49:56.106 --> 03:50:03.551]  At first, Natalie Richard didn't believe her daughter when she said she wasn't allowed to say no to a boy at a school dance.
[03:50:04.321 --> 03:50:14.546]  The Utah mom told Fox News her daughter in grade six was informed by teachers she had to say yes to the boys who wanted to dance with her at the Valentine's Day dance.
[03:50:15.586 --> 03:50:16.987]  The mother went to the school to investigate.
[03:50:17.007 --> 03:50:18.487]  She found out the rule's been around for a while.
[03:50:18.828 --> 03:50:23.890]  The school basically said that they've had a dance set up this way for a while because they were concerned.
[03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:26.991]  They had a concern that it would be nicer.
[03:50:27.591 --> 03:50:28.532]  This would be nice.
[03:50:30.073 --> 03:50:33.054]  And the boys, you would have no one feeling rejected.
[03:50:35.994 --> 03:50:37.875]  And Michael Ian Black is telling us we're broke?
[03:50:38.355 --> 03:50:39.335]  And schools are doing this?
[03:50:39.815 --> 03:50:41.055]  This is how you break people!
[03:50:41.876 --> 03:50:44.617]  You don't... It's called rejection!
[03:50:45.657 --> 03:50:47.517]  And you better learn it early, kids!
[03:50:48.138 --> 03:50:49.498]  You better learn it early!
[03:50:49.778 --> 03:50:53.059]  Because it will be a huge part of your life!
[03:50:53.939 --> 03:50:54.899]  Rejection!
[03:50:55.400 --> 03:50:58.901]  In love, in business, everything!
[03:50:59.521 --> 03:51:00.661]  You will see rejection!
[03:51:00.881 --> 03:51:03.742]  And if you don't know how to handle it, you're gonna go off!
[03:51:04.375 --> 03:51:05.316]  And you're gonna freak out.
[03:51:05.856 --> 03:51:12.141]  And boy, with this whole Me Too thing, isn't it odd that they're telling guys that girls have to say yes?
[03:51:12.922 --> 03:51:16.144]  It's so counterintuitive to everything they're saying.
[03:51:16.865 --> 03:51:18.466]  Then he gets down to the real world.
[03:51:19.527 --> 03:51:24.991]  He asks a girl if she wants to go out, or maybe they have gone out and they want to get a little intimate.
[03:51:25.051 --> 03:51:25.771]  She says no.
[03:51:25.811 --> 03:51:28.553]  He's like, well, they taught me that you can't say no.
[03:51:29.434 --> 03:51:30.335]  School says yes.
[03:51:31.716 --> 03:51:33.317]  It's insanity.
[03:51:33.457 --> 03:51:39.720]  And this is the type of moronic ideology that is driving men batty.
[03:51:40.741 --> 03:51:44.262]  And young men's minds are already batty.
[03:51:44.503 --> 03:51:47.804]  They're full of hormones and thoughts and everything else.
[03:51:48.144 --> 03:51:51.966]  So you start twisting it around and making it even more confusing.
[03:51:54.188 --> 03:51:58.910]  And you're going to end up with some real mental patients that might do some damage.
[03:52:00.365 --> 03:52:11.169]  How about you let him ask a girl, work up the balls to ask a girl out, and if she says no, well, now you gotta deal with that.
[03:52:11.929 --> 03:52:14.110]  It's not easy, but such is life.
[03:52:15.911 --> 03:52:23.893]  Quickly, before we finish up, look, before 9-11, I remember before 9-11, kids.
[03:52:23.933 --> 03:52:26.874]  Let Grandpa wax fantastic about the old days.
[03:52:27.455 --> 03:52:28.495]  I remember these times.
[03:52:30.269 --> 03:52:38.333]  There was a time in, I believe, when I was a child, my daddy actually walked me into an airplane.
[03:52:39.613 --> 03:52:40.314]  Walked me right in!
[03:52:40.474 --> 03:52:41.154]  He didn't have a ticket.
[03:52:41.794 --> 03:52:42.655]  I was going somewhere.
[03:52:42.795 --> 03:52:43.915]  I had a business trip at seven.
[03:52:44.616 --> 03:52:45.416]  I had somewhere to go.
[03:52:46.217 --> 03:52:51.339]  My father was literally able to walk up to the plane, and there I was, and then he left.
[03:52:52.559 --> 03:52:53.660]  Well, things happened.
[03:52:54.497 --> 03:52:55.798]  And it made that impossible.
[03:52:56.359 --> 03:52:58.821]  And now, after 9-11, you see it.
[03:52:59.121 --> 03:53:05.727]  There's, uh, people, uh, military armed with automatic weapons at our airports, and we don't even bat an eye anymore.
[03:53:06.267 --> 03:53:07.148]  Security dogs.
[03:53:07.208 --> 03:53:10.771]  The security you gotta go through is, uh, it's like a juggling act.
[03:53:11.372 --> 03:53:12.613]  And that is the new normal.
[03:53:13.522 --> 03:53:24.869]  Well, we'd all like to think that school is like little Nellie Olsen and the Ingalls kids going off to the one-room schoolhouse with their lunch pails.
[03:53:25.690 --> 03:53:27.391]  Well, that just isn't it anymore.
[03:53:27.931 --> 03:53:30.953]  We need security at the schools.
[03:53:31.774 --> 03:53:33.415]  You're talking about saving kids.
[03:53:34.306 --> 03:53:36.467]  We need security at the schools.
[03:53:36.507 --> 03:53:39.468]  And I'm not just talking about people that are armed.
[03:53:39.809 --> 03:53:48.532]  Whether it's trained administrators or actual guards that are carrying concealed weapons as part of the whole thing.
[03:53:49.073 --> 03:53:55.035]  But we need a security ritual at schools that will keep these people from getting in.
[03:53:55.636 --> 03:53:57.917]  A school should be a locked down area.
[03:53:58.897 --> 03:54:01.858]  There is apparently precious cargo inside.
[03:54:04.582 --> 03:54:08.503]  And it's treated like an open door policy, where anyone can walk in.
[03:54:08.964 --> 03:54:09.904]  This has to stop.
[03:54:10.304 --> 03:54:11.024]  Sad about it?
[03:54:11.404 --> 03:54:11.885]  Sorry.
[03:54:12.585 --> 03:54:14.225]  Eliminating guns isn't gonna do it.
[03:54:14.705 --> 03:54:16.586]  Trying to weed out nuts ain't gonna do it.
[03:54:17.006 --> 03:54:18.287]  You have to do it at the source.
[03:54:18.867 --> 03:54:20.788]  Where are school shootings happening?
[03:54:21.188 --> 03:54:22.228]  At school!
[03:54:23.509 --> 03:54:25.729]  They're buildings, with doors on them.
[03:54:26.670 --> 03:54:28.670]  Make sure these people aren't getting in!
[03:54:29.310 --> 03:54:30.611]  That seems reasonable.
[03:54:31.610 --> 03:54:36.373]  That seems like something we don't have to eliminate an amendment of our Constitution for.
[03:54:36.393 --> 03:54:38.654]  How are we going to pay for it?
[03:54:38.694 --> 03:54:39.354]  How are we going to pay for it?
[03:54:39.374 --> 03:54:40.075]  How are we going to pay for it?
[03:54:40.255 --> 03:54:41.335]  That's what I'm hearing on Twitter.
[03:54:41.575 --> 03:54:42.456]  How are we going to pay for it?
[03:54:43.697 --> 03:54:45.758]  I am an avid shooter.
[03:54:46.498 --> 03:54:47.519]  I am a gun collector.
[03:54:48.299 --> 03:54:51.080]  I am a staunch Second Amendment rights advocate.
[03:54:52.661 --> 03:54:53.702]  I would be willing
[03:54:54.870 --> 03:55:02.953]  To pay an extra tax on guns and ammunition that would specifically go to school security.
[03:55:03.353 --> 03:55:03.974]  How's that?
[03:55:05.274 --> 03:55:13.777]  Oh, by the way, within two years, some corrupt politician will line his pockets and cronies pockets with it and turn it into something for his agenda.
[03:55:14.018 --> 03:55:15.778]  But to start, it sounds good.
[03:55:16.358 --> 03:55:22.621]  I am absolutely willing to pay a tax on my guns and my ammunition
[03:55:23.433 --> 03:55:29.959]  That specifically only goes to setting up security in schools to prevent it.
[03:55:30.239 --> 03:55:38.787]  We pay more in taxes and airfare and whatever else it took to get our security at airports after 9-11.
[03:55:39.287 --> 03:55:43.050]  We ate it, we realized it was an issue, and we dealt with it.
[03:55:43.831 --> 03:55:46.133]  We can do this at schools.
[03:55:46.233 --> 03:55:48.655]  Like I said, we know where this happens.
[03:55:49.736 --> 03:55:50.417]  At school!
[03:55:52.046 --> 03:55:53.927]  So, secure the schools.
[03:55:54.507 --> 03:56:01.671]  If it upsets you as a parent that your kid is going into what you deem as some armed encampment now, relax.
[03:56:02.332 --> 03:56:05.133]  They're gonna go in, they're gonna learn, and it'll be safer.
[03:56:05.974 --> 03:56:07.575]  But these are the times we live in.
[03:56:08.715 --> 03:56:13.618]  You could argue the point of why we live in these times until I'm nauseous.
[03:56:14.778 --> 03:56:15.699]  And I'm nauseous.
[03:56:16.764 --> 03:56:18.025]  We could argue it forever.
[03:56:18.565 --> 03:56:24.369]  But the bottom line is, we are living in these times, and something does need to be done about it.
[03:56:25.410 --> 03:56:29.593]  And security should be the first and foremost at this point.
[03:56:29.913 --> 03:56:32.514]  It's a solution that could be implemented very quickly.
[03:56:34.015 --> 03:56:42.181]  It can't be infiltrated by black market weapons after a ban, because that's all that would happen if you ban certain weapons.
[03:56:42.741 --> 03:56:45.223]  And we can't depend on lunatics
[03:56:46.129 --> 03:56:50.531]  To adhere to our laws and live in a civilized society.
[03:56:51.251 --> 03:57:02.075]  So parents, I apologize, but it does seem the only way to keep your kids from being shot in school is to keep people from getting into these schools that want to shoot your kids.
[03:57:03.455 --> 03:57:11.438]  And considering that 99.9% of a school is a building and the rest are doors, put the security at the doors.
[03:57:12.903 --> 03:57:16.484]  And relax, and then you can relax that your kids are safe.
[03:57:16.764 --> 03:57:18.064]  But it's something that needs to be done.
[03:57:19.104 --> 03:57:20.885]  Well, continue your argument on Twitter.
[03:57:22.265 --> 03:57:23.505]  I'm going out tonight.
[03:57:24.485 --> 03:57:24.965]  I've had it.
[03:57:25.525 --> 03:57:27.026]  And we'll be back here in a couple of weeks.
[03:57:27.246 --> 03:57:30.786]  Thank you to Alex Jones and all the fine people at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:30.846 --> 03:57:31.446]  I'm Anthony Cumia.
[03:57:31.466 --> 03:57:36.107]  You can catch me at CompoundMedia.com from 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:57:36.147 --> 03:57:37.067]  Monday through Thursday.
[03:57:38.328 --> 03:57:40.428]  Thank you, and we'll see you again in two weeks.
[03:57:54.798 --> 03:58:01.561]  This is the best deal we've ever offered on our flagship product, DNA Force.
[03:58:01.721 --> 03:58:03.561]  And it's got a very interesting story behind it.
[03:58:03.721 --> 03:58:09.424]  I was at a medical doctor's clinic facility that had top-of-the-line nutraceuticals and was noticing that they were $200 to $400.
[03:58:09.504 --> 03:58:20.228]  And then I talked to my dad about it, who is a physician, and he said, absolutely, this is the biggest area in nutraceuticals and supplements is longevity and keeping your telomeres in place.
[03:58:20.248 --> 03:58:23.069]  You can't make telomeres grow, you can just make them not shrink as fast.
[03:58:23.109 --> 03:58:23.429]  Well, I
[03:58:23.729 --> 03:58:40.548]  Designed DNA Force with Dr. Group, and Dr. Group's a great guy, but then we were gonna come out with Cell Force because I was able to find just as good of the same compounds for a lower price, and was able to develop Cell Force, and Group liked the formula so much, he said, listen, we were gonna come out with DNA Force Plus,
[03:58:41.149 --> 03:58:50.313]  You just use that name and do it because this is such an incredible formula and I understand you're going to one of the biggest labs in the country and so you were able to scale up and lower price.
[03:58:50.454 --> 03:58:51.074]  I want to do that.
[03:58:51.454 --> 03:58:52.414]  He was so classy.
[03:58:52.494 --> 03:58:56.696]  He just said you just put out DNA Force Plus as Shell Force or vice versa.
[03:58:56.757 --> 03:58:57.777]  I was partnering with him on that.
[03:58:57.797 --> 03:58:58.798]  That's how classy he is.
[03:58:58.858 --> 03:58:59.798]  So Shell Force
