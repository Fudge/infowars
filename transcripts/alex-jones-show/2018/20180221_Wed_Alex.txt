[00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.363]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:18.045]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:26.410]  Hello and welcome to the Alex Jones Show and if you're wondering
[00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:46.608]  Why the dulcet tones of a well-dressed, well-educated Englishman are coming to you today, that's because our fearless leader is out elsewhere in the world doing whatever it is that international men of mystery get up to.
[00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:51.152]  I am Miley Yiannopoulos, standing in for Alex Jones for the next two hours.
[00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:58.998]  Alex will be back himself for the third hour of the show today, and the fourth hour of the show will be the one and only Roger Stone.
[00:01:00.464 --> 00:01:07.291]  I'm Milo, the host of The Milo Show, and you can go to Dangerous.com to read my journalism and find out my stuff.
[00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:18.842]  I have my own show, so you can go if by some strange and improbable chance four hours of InfoWars a day isn't enough for you, go and check out The Milo Show.
[00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:19.563]  You can go to Dangerous.com.
[00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:26.626]  Join, coming up today on the show, breaking news in Florida from Alex himself.
[00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.788]  He's going to be talking you through that in the third hour.
[00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:38.351]  We've got interviews with our reporter Laura Loomer who is on the ground, ferreting out the latest developments including another doorstop of the sheriff.
[00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:42.353]  News about tech, crumbling tech empires.
[00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:46.395]  The left's peculiar
[00:01:48.038 --> 00:01:57.643]  interference running and damage control as it emerges that there is something up with these child spokespeople.
[00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:02.285]  But before we get to all of that, a story about aid workers.
[00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:03.706]  This was in the Independent.
[00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:05.667]  This is a special report.
[00:02:05.807 --> 00:02:09.069]  Aid workers aren't saints and they can go bad.
[00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.269]  I know because I did.
[00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.369]  Well,
[00:02:13.118 --> 00:02:21.940]  Putting it mildly, the truth is that the majority of aid workers are morally compromised at best.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.603]  And many, let's just say it, many aid workers are really terrible people.
[00:02:32.163 --> 00:02:39.865]  If you think about the sense of moral self-righteousness that most people who work in the left-wing charitable sector have,
[00:02:41.132 --> 00:02:52.099]  By aid workers we're not talking about people who work with veterans, people who are doing noble things to preserve freedoms and to look after people who are underprivileged or whatnot.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.583]  We're talking about people who work in the corporatised, globalist, professionalised, charitable sector.
[00:02:58.903 --> 00:03:04.087]  People who are invariably, and almost without exception,
[00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:16.081]  signed up to an anti-free speech, anti-straight white male, anti-capitalist, anti-nation state, anti-border, anti-freedom agenda.
[00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:21.805]  These people signed up entirely to the extraordinary, bonkers beliefs
[00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.311]  Of the sorts of people who work at the United Nations.
[00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:35.376]  But it's even worse for people who are out there working in the field, UN workers for instance, because they operate internationally with almost no checks and balances on their behaviour.
[00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:38.157]  Behaviour that includes sex, guns and drugs.
[00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:46.202]  These people are running riot all over the world in supposedly impoverished and terrible places, painting their own wrongdoing as the product of stress.
[00:03:47.302 --> 00:03:50.684]  This author in The Independent, which is a left-wing British publication, says,
[00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:56.472]  There's a third category of aid worker, the good one that turns bad.
[00:03:56.972 --> 00:04:00.656]  He says that aid working is like being a junkie on adrenaline.
[00:04:01.837 --> 00:04:17.110]  The stress gets to you and you start to sink into drugs, sex, lots and lots of sex he says, hence the book Emergency Sex and Other Desperate Measures, excuse making by liberals for their bad behavior in war-torn zones.
[00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.852]  Now we're starting to see this stuff come out.
[00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:24.645]  Oxfam is getting in the neck for the Haitian prostitute scandal, but this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:35.735]  And the way that I know that, the reason I can tell you with such certainty and confidence, is that I used to work, not a lot of people know this, I used to work as a chief researcher and speechwriter for a climate change NGO.
[00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:40.242]  These people are truly dreadful and I'm glad to see them getting their comeuppance.
[00:04:40.682 --> 00:04:43.423]  Aid workers, by and large, are awful people.
[00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:52.806]  And you shouldn't feel the slightest bit bad about Oxfam and these other globalised, massively wealthy charities crumbling, crashing and burning in flames.
[00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:56.747]  And with that cheerful start to the day, my name is Milo and this is InfoWars.
[00:04:56.767 --> 00:05:00.789]  We're going to be right back after this break with Florida Intrigue.
[00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:01.769]  See you in a second.
[00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:11.518]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:21.165]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:26.549]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:29.671]  It also funds the InfoWar, a total 360 win.
[00:05:30.092 --> 00:05:32.714]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:33.715 --> 00:05:38.438]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globals, but they're striking back all over the world.
[00:05:38.718 --> 00:05:44.262]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:53.408]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[00:05:53.568 --> 00:06:01.393]  So go to FortifiedSupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:03.115]  That's FortifiedSupply.com.
[00:06:04.456 --> 00:06:05.016]  We've got it.
[00:06:05.757 --> 00:06:11.521]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:11.581 --> 00:06:13.662]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:15.964 --> 00:06:21.688]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.833]  My fellow InfoWarriors, Billy Graham at 99 has died.
[00:06:28.573 --> 00:06:33.197]  And Billy Graham wasn't hardcore enough for a lot of Christians out there, but
[00:06:34.056 --> 00:06:54.914]  Throughout the last 65 years, going back all the way to Harry Truman, Billy Graham helped hold the line in many respects against modern globalist teachings and the whole ecumenical movement that was attempting to destroy the core principles of Christianity.
[00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:56.636]  And looking back,
[00:06:57.796 --> 00:07:12.048]  Without people like Billy Graham, we wouldn't even have the foundation we have today to fight back against Hollywood and those that would remove any Christian values that we have so that they can replace it with their whole globalist orthodoxy.
[00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:23.178]  That said, there's a story on InfoWars.com today that ties into this out of Purdue University, one of the most prestigious universities, obviously, not just in the U.S., but in the world.
[00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:42.413]  Known for its academic freedom and excellence for over 100 years, Purdue has put out their official reader, their official guidebook for writing in the English department and for students called the OWL.
[00:07:43.193 --> 00:07:46.975]  They've been putting it out again for decades and it says, do not use the word man.
[00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:52.547]  Because man is masculine, man is bad, man is associated with bad things.
[00:07:53.468 --> 00:07:58.531]  So again, this whole political correctness thing is about ending normal humanity as we know it.
[00:07:58.651 --> 00:08:00.872]  Ending the normal human compact.
[00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:03.414]  Ending the normal biological system.
[00:08:04.014 --> 00:08:06.716]  And taking humanity beyond domestication.
[00:08:08.325 --> 00:08:08.605]  Absolutely.
[00:08:29.386 --> 00:08:32.188]  Technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:54.646]  Just type in, in defense of technocracy, you'll get Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, the Financial Times, all of the establishment publications saying we are a technocracy, we are a technological takeover by an authoritarian group that is going to program the general public exactly as we see fit.
[00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:56.247]  Now think about that.
[00:08:57.247 --> 00:08:57.887]  Think about that.
[00:08:58.347 --> 00:09:01.249]  Making some moves here in traffic as I record this voice memo.
[00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:06.651]  For transmission today with Milo's co-hosting, I'll be coming on later.
[00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:12.994]  Taking care of a lot of critical infrastructure and preparations for massive expansion in the face of the NWO.
[00:09:13.374 --> 00:09:18.296]  We've promised this each time and expanded massively and had devastating effects against the enemy.
[00:09:19.257 --> 00:09:24.439]  And I'm telling you now, we're about to make our biggest expansion ever in the face of massive censorship and attacks.
[00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:26.620]  But getting back to Billy Graham.
[00:09:28.717 --> 00:09:39.821]  People would think six, seven years ago when I covered articles about elementary students in the UK being told that they're purple penguins, that you can't be a boy or a girl, people thought that was a joke.
[00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:41.301]  And then a year later, it was in the US.
[00:09:41.801 --> 00:09:43.982]  Then a few years later, it was all across the United States.
[00:09:44.602 --> 00:09:50.764]  And then they would tell parents on entrance form for kindergartners or Head Start, don't call yourself mother or father.
[00:09:50.804 --> 00:09:52.845]  That could be hurtful, but someone else that doesn't.
[00:09:53.565 --> 00:09:57.367]  Now you think about that from an authoritarian perspective of a fictitious 1984.
[00:09:59.537 --> 00:10:04.179]  Or even in 1984, they can use the words mother and father, and men and women still have relationships.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:16.665]  But Orwell, in his fictional, futurist dystopia, projects that they would finally get rid of the family itself, because it was in competition with the state.
[00:10:17.786 --> 00:10:19.126]  And that's why they're getting rid of God.
[00:10:19.847 --> 00:10:22.068]  Because God can be your image, your idea.
[00:10:23.143 --> 00:10:23.323]  I think?
[00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:56.193]  Any real destiny, any real success, and instead are just experts on fighting with each other and acting like ninny in basket cases.
[00:10:56.453 --> 00:11:13.636]  So, we can sit there and look at the strictures of conservatives and of Christians and their warnings of what would happen if the nuclear family broke down, and their warnings of the disintegration of society, and think, well, that's a form
[00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.130]  Of control.
[00:11:16.691 --> 00:11:18.211]  That's a form of manipulation.
[00:11:18.672 --> 00:11:20.052]  And so we're rebelling against it.
[00:11:20.652 --> 00:11:40.041]  But if you look at what happened in the 60s and 70s and 80s, the CIA and others declassified the fact that his leftist inside those organizations admitted that they were seeking to overthrow the entire existing order and replace it with something infinitely more centralized, autocratic and authoritarian.
[00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:41.982]  And so that's a fact.
[00:11:42.898 --> 00:11:59.333]  There is an absolute war on what they call the bourgeois, the middle class, the upwardly mobile, and it's by the elite itself that wants to eradicate any cultures, any systems that it doesn't totally control.
[00:12:00.394 --> 00:12:02.496]  And so, yes, it's easy to
[00:12:03.717 --> 00:12:12.550]  Take on the so-called pseudo-intellectual garment of individuals that roll their eyes at preachers and the people that warn about the destruction of the family.
[00:12:13.231 --> 00:12:19.379]  But now the facts are in a hundred percent in triplicate that we indeed have seen
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:39.454]  A breakdown in civilization due to the breakdown of the family with the ongoing assault and even those that still carry out a system of stability and success and competency do it somewhat secretly and under avail as if we are committing some type of dirty, heretical
[00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:44.390]  It was the West that was open for women to vote.
[00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:49.291]  It was the West that was open to decriminalize same-sex activities.
[00:12:49.731 --> 00:13:04.454]  It was the West that was the trailblazer in true equality, in true open societies, in true live and let live philosophy.
[00:13:05.194 --> 00:13:09.335]  But just because you live and let live, just because you're tolerant
[00:13:10.538 --> 00:13:37.377]  Does it mean then you give up your basic operating system because just the mere existence of capitalism or the mere existence of European or Western values, because the mere existence of it in museums affronts the globalists because it can't be allowed to stand because an open, free, true renaissance society is so much sexier and so much cooler.
[00:13:39.483 --> 00:13:50.490]  Then the modern globalist technocracy, which is really just an ancient system of cult-like control with a high-tech overlay and high-tech digital straitjacket to control.
[00:13:52.312 --> 00:14:01.658]  So that said, the old Western values would criticize and warn about broken families and warn about cheating on your wife.
[00:14:02.418 --> 00:14:05.881]  Not from some hypocritical perspective, but because they knew they'd done it.
[00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.963]  And they'd come out of the dark age and out of true barbarism.
[00:14:10.257 --> 00:14:28.704]  And so now look at where we are today, where it's not about equality, it's about the people that have put themselves into these new subgroups, now announcing themselves the dominant culture and the new religion, and telling all of us that we must comply, or we'll be banned from the internet, we'll be ostracized, we'll be censored.
[00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:30.785]  We'll be persecuted.
[00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:32.647]  We'll be hit in the head with a bike lock.
[00:14:33.047 --> 00:14:35.810]  You see signs up saying kill the NRA members.
[00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:38.452]  Major billboards still not taken down.
[00:14:38.913 --> 00:14:41.916]  Left is saying abort your babies so they don't die in mass shootings.
[00:14:42.556 --> 00:14:44.518]  Just open calls for violence everywhere.
[00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:48.822]  You see what happens when strong cultures
[00:14:50.239 --> 00:15:00.770]  Because they are seen as too dominant, too successful, too sexy, commit suicide, hoping it makes other systems
[00:15:02.085 --> 00:15:03.026]  Feel more at home.
[00:15:03.746 --> 00:15:05.648]  That is the essence of being a cuck.
[00:15:06.268 --> 00:15:08.210]  That is the essence of cultural suicide.
[00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:30.066]  And you see that into that vacuum comes the technocrats then directing the most barbarous and racist and dumbed down and most controlling elements of all the different disparate groups where the globalists have colonized the third world, enslaved it, weaponized it, dumbed it down, and are now in movies like Black Panther saying it's time for the third world
[00:15:30.586 --> 00:15:33.548]  to come in and then colonize what's left of the West.
[00:15:33.788 --> 00:15:36.449]  But in truth, they're not really going to be colonizing what's left of the West.
[00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:48.195]  They are just going to be making sure that anything that could ever allow freedom to spring again, or true diversity spring again, or true renaissance spring again, or true free market to spring again, will be dynamited and will be destroyed.
[00:15:48.735 --> 00:15:53.978]  All right, back to the live transmission and the one, the only Milo hosting.
[00:15:54.318 --> 00:15:56.479]  I'll be in in the third hour co-hosting.
[00:15:56.719 --> 00:15:57.259]  Stay with us.
[00:15:57.379 --> 00:15:59.981]  Infowars.com, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:08.197]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[00:16:08.918 --> 00:16:12.221]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:16:13.082 --> 00:16:19.368]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:27.455]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:16:28.256 --> 00:16:33.520]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:46.250]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:53.093]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[00:17:15.687 --> 00:17:19.931]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:23.674]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:17:24.575 --> 00:17:34.765]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:17:35.545 --> 00:17:45.314]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[00:17:45.734 --> 00:17:54.261]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:08.336]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[00:18:09.117 --> 00:18:12.059]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:15.521]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:21.045]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[00:18:21.385 --> 00:18:27.689]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:33.233]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:37.295]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[00:18:37.895 --> 00:18:45.699]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[00:18:46.279 --> 00:18:50.621]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:54.883]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[00:18:55.183 --> 00:18:59.005]  Stay in the game with Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.

[00:19:01.866 --> 00:19:04.971]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:16.427]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[00:19:16.928 --> 00:19:17.849]  This is Pollen Block.
[00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:31.079]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:35.422]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[00:19:35.882 --> 00:19:39.905]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[00:19:40.365 --> 00:19:50.030]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.351]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[00:19:57.773 --> 00:20:00.935]  888-253-3139 You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.097 --> 00:20:34.019]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.782]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:42.724 --> 00:20:43.644]  Welcome back.
[00:20:44.284 --> 00:20:50.808]  Before the break, you heard the dear leader, one pastor giving his eulogy to another.
[00:20:52.005 --> 00:20:55.767]  Now we're going to move on to the two things biggest in my mind today.
[00:20:55.847 --> 00:21:01.451]  First of all, the unfurling scandal surrounding aid charities.
[00:21:03.152 --> 00:21:12.778]  Oxfam is embroiled in controversy at the moment because of its prostitution activities in Haiti.
[00:21:14.181 --> 00:21:16.682]  Let me tell you, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:19.664]  Let's just be clear, aid workers are terrible people.
[00:21:20.444 --> 00:21:35.012]  This is not, you know, the giving self-sacrifice of a church parishioner who hops in on Sundays to help out people who cannot feed themselves properly.
[00:21:36.012 --> 00:21:42.316]  Aid workers in countries like Rwanda and Bosnia and Haiti are rich
[00:21:43.533 --> 00:21:50.617]  Entitled white liberals out there spreading the gospel of climate change with a bent knee to the citadel of globalism.
[00:21:52.718 --> 00:21:53.598]  These are not heroes.
[00:21:54.078 --> 00:22:05.224]  These are people whose moral and ethical systems are heavily and irredeemably compromised by the terrible people they work around for and with.
[00:22:07.565 --> 00:22:10.587]  And it shouldn't surprise us that this unfurling tragedy is
[00:22:13.547 --> 00:22:20.653]  It's starting to tarnish the reputations of organizations that had previously been unscathed by critique, and it took the MeToo movement to do it.
[00:22:21.634 --> 00:22:41.650]  I worked for a climate change NGO, which I don't like to tell people very often because it is not a particularly bright spot on my resume, but I was chief researcher and speechwriter for a climate change NGO, one of the member organizations of this vast, parasitic bureaucracy that orbits the UN.
[00:22:42.768 --> 00:22:48.711]  And I saw firsthand how the IPCC cooks the books, makes up the numbers.
[00:22:48.752 --> 00:22:49.832]  I saw it with my own eyes.
[00:22:49.892 --> 00:22:56.496]  I saw people changing numbers from studies to better fit political priorities and hysterical language.
[00:22:56.836 --> 00:23:02.439]  I saw executive summaries being ginned up to be as hysterical as possible.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:11.685]  And in my time there, I spent a lot of work trips with people who did the kind of work that Oxfam and other charities do in war-torn areas.
[00:23:13.021 --> 00:23:31.445]  Their lives may superficially be dedicated to the betterment of others and to the advancement of medicine and peace, but their lives are saturated not just with drugs and with sex, which they excuse by saying they're under so much stress, but also with guns.
[00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:42.328]  These people operate internationally and out of the reach of the rule of law, running shotgun with armies from both sides in some cases of conflicts,
[00:23:44.252 --> 00:24:03.280]  Throwing themselves around some of the most exciting and beautiful places on Earth, drenched in drugs, sex and guns, whining about how stressed they are and how really, you know, if only you knew how awful it was working for a rich, multinational, globalist NGO, spending time in the most beautiful places on planet Earth.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.981]  You'd understand why I had to hire prostitutes.
[00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:05.781]  Give me a break.
[00:24:07.878 --> 00:24:17.073]  The other news story that is consuming the week is of course Florida, and the left is not enjoying very much being caught out on its little canal.
[00:24:18.598 --> 00:24:19.879]  These poor innocent students.
[00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:28.744]  Let's show two tweets from one of the students that purport to represent the opinion of one of the kids caught in Florida.
[00:24:28.784 --> 00:24:30.886]  Now look, it's not a polite thing to say.
[00:24:30.966 --> 00:24:33.447]  It's not a very family-friendly thing to say.
[00:24:33.507 --> 00:24:35.749]  It's the sort of thing that makes people very upset at you.
[00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:42.053]  But it is unarguably true that there is something up with the testimony of these kids on TV.
[00:24:42.093 --> 00:24:43.553]  We saw this Douglas Hogg kid.
[00:24:44.588 --> 00:24:47.950]  Give beautifully rehearsed lines one day, stumble on another day.
[00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:54.714]  We saw video of him from California, some confected nonsense up there where he was presumably practicing for primetime.
[00:24:55.054 --> 00:24:58.156]  There's something up with the testimony from these kids.
[00:24:58.176 --> 00:24:58.977]  And we've got two tweets.
[00:24:59.037 --> 00:25:11.905]  One of them, as the kids, their minders and TV networks run damage control with Douglas Hogg and his FBI dad on CNN with Anderson Cooper, who never met a story he didn't cry at.
[00:25:13.393 --> 00:25:18.918]  Desperately entreating America to set aside the conspiracy theories.
[00:25:18.938 --> 00:25:19.719]  But look for your own eyes.
[00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:21.100]  There's something weird about this.
[00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:25.565]  If we could throw these two tweets up from this girl, screeching, we are kids!
[00:25:26.326 --> 00:25:27.266]  We are kids!
[00:25:28.408 --> 00:25:29.128]  And look at her.
[00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:30.570]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:25:34.261 --> 00:25:35.201]  This is very odd to me.
[00:25:35.261 --> 00:25:39.882]  If you look at the Twitter stream of this particular girl, there is something up with it.
[00:25:39.902 --> 00:25:47.024]  There's another tweet where she says, I just started organizing this march and I didn't even know anyone was going to show up and now everyone around the world is watching.
[00:25:47.344 --> 00:26:01.708]  This is like a middle-aged social justice warrior's idea of what a kid might say, of how to touch the hearts of millions with the intrepid and brave stories of these courageous children.
[00:26:03.817 --> 00:26:16.674]  But there's something up here and we're going to find out what it is and the way you know that is the networks, I mentioned on the show yesterday, the way you know that there is something up is that the networks and the newspapers are so hysterically trying to shut it down.
[00:26:17.054 --> 00:26:20.559]  Ridiculing and badgering anybody who dares to mention it.
[00:26:21.869 --> 00:26:22.569]  CNN reports.
[00:26:22.609 --> 00:26:28.152]  If you ever want to really annoy yourself, go and take a look at CNN's reporting.
[00:26:28.172 --> 00:26:30.133]  The written reporting on CNN.com.
[00:26:30.553 --> 00:26:31.754]  And look at the adjectives.
[00:26:32.714 --> 00:26:33.695]  They're so desperate.
[00:26:33.795 --> 00:26:36.656]  The false reports from these shameful such-and-such, you know.
[00:26:36.976 --> 00:26:38.017]  This isn't news reporting.
[00:26:38.057 --> 00:26:44.440]  It's opinion writing masquerading as news in the service of CNN's own political agenda.
[00:26:45.782 --> 00:26:50.365]  This stuff is being used to push narratives, not just about gun control, but also about video games.
[00:26:50.445 --> 00:26:56.329]  Now, Florida legislators are suggesting, contrary to all evidence and experience, that video games can make you violent, so we should look at that.
[00:26:56.809 --> 00:26:57.830]  And even pornography.
[00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.713]  Somebody reported that the shooter was playing a lot of video games.
[00:27:01.913 --> 00:27:05.635]  There is no evidence whatsoever that video games can make you violent.
[00:27:05.895 --> 00:27:15.642]  In fact, there are studies that show that it helps boys to let off steam, and they behave more congenially and pleasantly to people after they've played very competitive games.
[00:27:16.703 --> 00:27:24.911]  No evidence for this whatsoever, but this is being used to push a variety of narratives, all of them designed to erode your freedoms.
[00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:26.813]  And it's even happening in Arizona.
[00:27:28.812 --> 00:27:36.935]  Indoctrination of young kids by teachers should be a cause for worry for anyone who has children in a public school.
[00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:38.995]  Let me read you a letter I got from a fan.
[00:27:40.316 --> 00:27:42.376]  She says, Hi Milo, my name is Brianna.
[00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:46.958]  I live in Arizona and my brother's high school made an announcement asking students to step outside.
[00:27:47.378 --> 00:27:49.600]  ...and protest Trump, as well as the NRA and guns.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.022]  They're pushing for gun control and are using the students to do it.
[00:27:53.302 --> 00:27:58.305]  My brother got into an argument with his social studies teacher after he told her he would not be participating in the protest.
[00:27:58.665 --> 00:28:03.028]  She then proceeded to tell him if he did not participate, that she would fail him.
[00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:11.594]  Students are now threatening their kids' educations, their educational futures, because they have the wrong opinion.
[00:28:12.819 --> 00:28:21.524]  About matters that concern their own freedoms because they don't sign up to what CNN and ABC want you to think.
[00:28:22.044 --> 00:28:32.849]  And we've got a clip from NBC which I'd like to play you, which is the worst, you know, very often reasonable, respectable and kind people on both sides of debate can have different ideas about where the truth is.
[00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.972]  But after the break, I'm going to play you a clip from NBC crowing.
[00:28:38.092 --> 00:28:41.513]  About gun owners melting down and smashing up their own guns.
[00:28:42.033 --> 00:28:46.175]  Because I think it gives you a little insight into the psychology of the people who are pushing this stuff.
[00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:47.935]  It is deeply, deeply upsetting.
[00:28:48.455 --> 00:28:52.296]  NBC crowing and exhibiting the death of American freedoms.
[00:28:52.577 --> 00:28:56.678]  We'll be right back after this break and then I'm going to show you this clip from NBC because it's really, really very distressing.
[00:28:56.718 --> 00:28:57.158]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:03.027 --> 00:29:11.893]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[00:29:13.113 --> 00:29:14.914]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[00:29:14.954 --> 00:29:22.079]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[00:29:22.499 --> 00:29:28.263]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[00:29:28.963 --> 00:29:30.284]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[00:29:30.884 --> 00:29:49.956]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[00:29:51.036 --> 00:29:55.159]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[00:29:55.479 --> 00:30:00.742]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about a thousand years ago is true.
[00:30:01.162 --> 00:30:02.203]  As above, so below.
[00:30:02.763 --> 00:30:05.585]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[00:30:06.485 --> 00:30:07.566]  Most tiny of scales.
[00:30:08.086 --> 00:30:09.187]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:30:09.567 --> 00:30:11.068]  America is building its wall.
[00:30:11.468 --> 00:30:11.948]  Will it work?
[00:30:12.068 --> 00:30:12.588]  We don't know.
[00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:13.669]  Is Trump right?
[00:30:14.349 --> 00:30:16.491]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[00:30:16.971 --> 00:30:20.573]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work.
[00:30:20.973 --> 00:30:22.954]  And without this wall, we would all die.
[00:30:23.314 --> 00:30:27.977]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family.
[00:30:27.997 --> 00:30:29.198]  And I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[00:30:29.938 --> 00:30:36.241]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:52.008]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[00:30:52.668 --> 00:30:55.029]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[00:30:55.689 --> 00:30:58.930]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.971]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[00:31:04.011 --> 00:31:06.612]  Brett Smith, author of Thump!
[00:31:06.732 --> 00:31:08.072]  The First Bundred Days.
[00:31:08.792 --> 00:31:10.293]  Explain to people about Thump!
[00:31:10.353 --> 00:31:12.293]  and why this is an important book and how it ties into things.
[00:31:12.653 --> 00:31:14.814]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[00:31:14.974 --> 00:31:19.635]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the President.
[00:31:19.735 --> 00:31:24.559]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:30.484]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable, fluffy little bunny?
[00:31:30.724 --> 00:31:33.227]  It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[00:31:33.267 --> 00:31:34.388]  It's actually hilarious.
[00:31:34.448 --> 00:31:35.929]  I was cracking up reading the whole book.
[00:31:35.969 --> 00:31:36.910]  My wife was cracking up.
[00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.150]  And it's a great book for adults.
[00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:39.230]  It's a great book for children.
[00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:40.631]  We're selling the book.
[00:31:40.891 --> 00:31:46.792]  We've got it bundled as well here with a one-off poster that's a collector's item.
[00:31:46.992 --> 00:31:50.233]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the poster are $29.95.
[00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:52.113]  That helps support us.
[00:31:52.353 --> 00:31:53.354]  So get the book, Thump!
[00:31:53.474 --> 00:31:55.694]  The First Hundred Days, and Alex Jones and Thump!

[00:32:42.748 --> 00:32:44.889]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:20.581 --> 00:33:21.342]  Big Brother.
[00:33:22.683 --> 00:33:23.944]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:25.485 --> 00:33:26.606]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:29.028]  You want answers?
[00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:30.970]  Well, so does he.

[00:33:41.303 --> 00:33:41.843]  Welcome back.
[00:33:41.923 --> 00:33:44.705]  I am Milo, standing in for Alex Jones.
[00:33:44.785 --> 00:33:46.807]  I'm on loan from Dangerous.com.
[00:33:46.827 --> 00:33:49.708]  You can see my show, the Milo Show, Dangerous.com slash join.
[00:33:49.888 --> 00:34:00.075]  And I'm here, live in studio, in our pink-flushed, slightly gayified InfoWars studio, standing in for the big guy.
[00:34:00.775 --> 00:34:06.279]  Twitter's head of trust and safety, Del Harvey, is the worst kind of liberal.
[00:34:06.339 --> 00:34:07.900]  She's both evil and stupid.
[00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:13.915]  Today trending on Twitter is Twitter lockdown.
[00:34:15.735 --> 00:34:34.678]  The latest thing they're doing to conservatives is demanding that we, and by we I mean you because it's been some time since I've been allowed a Twitter account as many of you will know, you have to give Twitter your cell phone number to verify your phone number before they will allow you back into your account.
[00:34:34.738 --> 00:34:38.639]  This is a number grab by Twitter.
[00:34:40.387 --> 00:34:41.508]  What could the motivations be?
[00:34:41.988 --> 00:34:51.236]  I don't think that there's some abrupt case in which, you know, conservatives are needing to verify their identities because of ID fraud.
[00:34:51.316 --> 00:34:52.057]  What is going on?
[00:34:52.697 --> 00:34:56.901]  I believe that the confected hysteria
[00:34:58.095 --> 00:35:06.317]  about Russia is being used as a pretext to acquire personal information from accounts that Twitter has identified as being run by conservatives.
[00:35:07.197 --> 00:35:17.619]  What Twitter will say is that they have identified Russian bots on the network and therefore they need to verify the identity of accounts that may or may not be compromised and we need to verify that whatever.
[00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:18.219]  No.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:25.441]  There are plenty of ways to do this without demanding that we hand over our cell phones
[00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:34.905]  Our cell phone numbers to Twitter before they allow us to go back on the service, before they allow us to use their service.
[00:35:34.925 --> 00:35:42.028]  Now this comes in the wake of a Vanity Fair report that is brutal about Del Harvey, a very early Twitter employee.
[00:35:42.088 --> 00:35:51.853]  She's still with the company, she's been there a really long time and she is by common consent grotesquely out of her depth in her current role, which is the troll hunter-in-chief.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:36:07.730]  She's been shat on by, excuse my language, by anonymous sources to Vanity Fair's Maya Kossoff, who wrote a story recently which sent shockwaves around Twitter's management.
[00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:15.236]  It said, and it just revealed what we all knew by the way, which is that Twitter is held together with bubblegum, string and bits of old Kleenex boxes.
[00:36:15.837 --> 00:36:19.940]  If you read between the lines of this piece in Vanity Fair, you'll see the executives at Twitter don't care
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.820]  That free speech is dead.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.761]  They don't care about the site lacking basic features.
[00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:42.926]  What they care about is punishing conservatives, which is why they have allowed this regime, with its notoriously opaque rules and selective enforcement of those rules, to run rampant under the gentle guidance of Del Harvey.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:50.244]  Whom even social justice warriors are getting ticked off with because she doesn't do enough to censor Twitter.
[00:36:50.984 --> 00:36:56.307]  Just an ass-backward tech company, how Twitter lost the internet war is how Vanity Fair puts it.
[00:36:56.627 --> 00:37:09.775]  Now some people are saying that Vanity Fair has been fed a lot of information by disgruntled executives and she's getting a bad rap, but it doesn't really matter whether it's her or whether it's just a systematic endemic problem in Twitter's culture.
[00:37:10.176 --> 00:37:12.017]  What we know for sure is that they are
[00:37:13.087 --> 00:37:26.917]  Fundamentally, structurally, spiritually hostile to Conservatives and Libertarians, and they are using every excuse possible, not just to censor us, but now with Twitter lockdown, to collect private data about us.
[00:37:27.277 --> 00:37:32.481]  I don't know how you feel about handing over your cell number to Twitter, but for me it's a hard pass.
[00:37:34.212 --> 00:37:38.936]  Facebook co-founder at the same time is warning that tech is going to take all of our jobs.
[00:37:39.476 --> 00:37:58.552]  One of the early employees of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who has since recanted to some extent, warning about the dangers of Facebook interviews, says that the mechanization and digitization and the software eating the world that is being driven in part by social networking companies is not going to let up.
[00:37:59.329 --> 00:38:04.553]  It's destroying American jobs, the world of work in America in terrible threat.
[00:38:04.853 --> 00:38:06.054]  And finally on the tech question...
[00:38:08.171 --> 00:38:13.616]  YouTube is, of course, owned by Google, notorious for its crackdowns on conservative points of view.
[00:38:13.736 --> 00:38:22.985]  And Prager University, run by Dennis Prager, who is a luminary of the Republican conservative movement in this country, does a series of videos on YouTube.
[00:38:23.005 --> 00:38:23.966]  They're called PragerU.
[00:38:24.246 --> 00:38:30.572]  You can go and you can get an education in cultural issues from Dennis Prager and his guests.
[00:38:31.345 --> 00:38:40.613]  Well, they touched one of the third rails of the left wing, which is abortion, with the result that YouTube has disabled embedding on the video.
[00:38:40.633 --> 00:38:44.456]  So you can't share the video to somebody and have it embedded in a news story.
[00:38:44.817 --> 00:38:48.100]  You can't see the video under certain circumstances.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.361]  It's one of the ways in which Twitter
[00:38:49.881 --> 00:38:50.521]  We're good.
[00:39:08.066 --> 00:39:18.711]  The most devastating thing to do is to limit the sharing and the embedding, because it kills people's ability to share the content, to have that video play out elsewhere on the internet outside of YouTube.
[00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:23.633]  And even for people to find it if they're elsewhere on YouTube, so you don't pop up in the list on the right.
[00:39:24.093 --> 00:39:25.854]  I've been in those YouTube cycles.
[00:39:25.874 --> 00:39:29.836]  You get locked in just looking at more and more and more things, and you don't pop up in any of those lists.
[00:39:31.243 --> 00:39:32.383]  So it's death to the video.
[00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:35.664]  It's total death to the video.
[00:39:35.704 --> 00:39:41.806]  This is the latest wave of YouTube's attempts to censor without censoring.
[00:39:42.167 --> 00:39:45.488]  And it's all done, of course, in the name of trust and safety.
[00:39:45.968 --> 00:39:47.208]  It's for the safety of our users.
[00:39:47.668 --> 00:39:49.769]  It's to avoid abuse, spam and harassment.
[00:39:49.809 --> 00:39:52.270]  We've been told by users that... Give me a break!
[00:39:53.325 --> 00:40:05.722]  This is a systematic, deliberate, purposeful, planned and absolutely unacceptable assault on Libertarians and Conservatives and it is continuing apace.
[00:40:06.483 --> 00:40:09.286]  Latest Twitter infraction.
[00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:11.922]  It's just another example.
[00:40:11.962 --> 00:40:20.795]  The big argument really over the next 10 to 15 years in this country is going to be whether social media companies should be regulated like public utilities.
[00:40:21.276 --> 00:40:24.801]  Now that makes some libertarians and some conservatives feel deeply uncomfortable.
[00:40:25.021 --> 00:40:26.323]  Makes us feel very uncomfortable.
[00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:29.784]  Makes us feel awkward, makes us feel edgy.
[00:40:29.965 --> 00:40:31.747]  We're just like, no, no, we don't really believe in that.
[00:40:31.787 --> 00:40:33.850]  But there are monopolies in every other industry.
[00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:39.137]  There are monopolies in, you know, and there are regulations in every other industry, whether it's oil, whether it's finance, whatever it is.
[00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:43.804]  We're perfectly happy to wade in where we think abuses are being perpetrated.
[00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:47.473]  And give guardrails to capitalism.
[00:40:47.773 --> 00:40:49.994]  It's the purpose of state regulation of business.
[00:40:50.355 --> 00:40:53.717]  It's just some guardrails so private enterprises don't go off the rails.
[00:40:54.117 --> 00:40:55.998]  Twitter and YouTube and Google, you know, Facebook.
[00:40:57.039 --> 00:41:02.463]  These companies have such extraordinary control and influence over our lives.
[00:41:03.624 --> 00:41:05.545]  And not just that, but influence over our democracy.
[00:41:06.789 --> 00:41:15.135]  What happens on Twitter, the stories that appear on Twitter, in large part dictate the stories that journalists are going to write about and how they're going to write about them.
[00:41:16.936 --> 00:41:19.018]  Journalists are pack animals and idiots.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:27.784]  And it only takes a couple of people expressing an opinion forcefully for it to become the received wisdom in the media.
[00:41:29.145 --> 00:41:31.948]  Just a couple of verified liberals on Twitter expressing their views
[00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.011]  On a contentious subject.
[00:41:34.811 --> 00:41:35.832]  And the matter is settled.
[00:41:36.372 --> 00:41:46.838]  And you'll see that same point of view, and even some of the same wording, pop up in sources as varied as Mike, BuzzFeed, The New York Times, and then you'll see it on CNN.
[00:41:46.878 --> 00:41:49.280]  And then you'll see it on ABC and NBC and CBS.
[00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.212]  This is the effect, this is the power that Twitter has over our national discourse, over international discourse.
[00:41:55.232 --> 00:42:03.814]  This is the power Twitter has over not just people's right to express themselves and to explore their own opinions, but people's rights to be told the truth.
[00:42:04.094 --> 00:42:05.575]  This is the power that Twitter has.
[00:42:06.917 --> 00:42:09.018]  Over American democracy and it's abusing that power.
[00:42:09.138 --> 00:42:11.600]  It's abusing that power every day and it's doing so deliberately.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:20.545]  It has become, thanks to its horrible financial circumstances and crashing prospects, as a going concern.
[00:42:20.805 --> 00:42:27.249]  Wouldn't surprise me if they considered taking it non-profit if the investors give up on any kind of returns in the future.
[00:42:27.669 --> 00:42:35.314]  This is Twitter turning itself into charitable enterprise first.
[00:42:36.912 --> 00:42:38.633]  And going private concerns second.
[00:42:38.693 --> 00:42:41.275]  All this is happening in the context of Silicon Valley.
[00:42:41.315 --> 00:42:42.155]  Destroying jobs.
[00:42:42.455 --> 00:42:43.676]  They even destroy where they live.
[00:42:43.936 --> 00:42:45.357]  Look at the state of San Francisco.
[00:42:45.577 --> 00:42:49.980]  Feces and syringes on the streets everywhere.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.441]  That's San Francisco for you.
[00:42:51.721 --> 00:42:52.541]  Downtown San Francisco.
[00:42:52.601 --> 00:42:53.402]  Not a place you want to live.
[00:42:53.442 --> 00:42:54.462]  It's like being on Twitter.
[00:42:54.602 --> 00:42:55.363]  It's gruesome.
[00:42:55.383 --> 00:42:58.505]  We'll be right back after this with the Michael Moore video.
[00:43:02.552 --> 00:43:05.295]  Joe Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[00:43:05.435 --> 00:43:09.979]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.462]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[00:43:12.502 --> 00:43:14.924]  Directed by the amazing director, Joe Gilbert.
[00:43:14.964 --> 00:43:15.805]  Here is the trailer.
[00:43:16.265 --> 00:43:20.490]  You call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.153]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:43:24.494 --> 00:43:26.215]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[00:43:26.275 --> 00:43:26.776]  Who cares?
[00:43:30.504 --> 00:43:31.425]  You haven't been called.
[00:43:33.226 --> 00:43:34.327]  Go back to Univision.
[00:43:35.528 --> 00:43:37.009]  I think Jeb is a nice person.
[00:43:37.029 --> 00:43:38.009]  He's very low energy.
[00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.271]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:43.033]  Throw him out.
[00:43:43.073 --> 00:43:44.654]  Throw him out into the cold.
[00:43:44.994 --> 00:43:49.598]  Don't give him their coat.
[00:43:49.658 --> 00:43:50.739]  No coats.
[00:43:50.759 --> 00:43:51.939]  L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[00:43:51.979 --> 00:43:53.360]  Lying dead.
[00:43:57.602 --> 00:44:02.266]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[00:44:02.566 --> 00:44:05.868]  The most dishonest human beings.
[00:44:05.888 --> 00:44:11.553]  These people right here.
[00:44:11.653 --> 00:44:12.753]  Look at all the cameras.
[00:44:12.773 --> 00:44:13.334]  So disgusting.
[00:44:13.354 --> 00:44:14.935]  This socialist slash communist.
[00:44:14.955 --> 00:44:15.496]  Crazy Bernie.
[00:44:15.516 --> 00:44:19.158]  He's crazy as it may look.
[00:44:19.258 --> 00:44:19.739]  Pocahontas?
[00:44:19.759 --> 00:44:20.639]  The Indian?
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.580]  Very offensive.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.621]  I'm sorry about that.
[00:44:22.961 --> 00:44:23.782]  A Pocahontas?
[00:44:25.848 --> 00:44:26.808]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:44:26.868 --> 00:44:28.029]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[00:44:28.049 --> 00:44:29.609]  She's been crooked from the beginning!
[00:44:29.629 --> 00:44:30.149]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.311]  Politicians are really dishonest.
[00:44:37.391 --> 00:44:43.092]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[00:44:43.112 --> 00:44:46.473]  This had nothing to do with me, except I might have pointed it out.
[00:44:48.604 --> 00:44:50.766]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[00:44:50.906 --> 00:44:52.728]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[00:44:52.748 --> 00:44:54.109]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:56.351]  Because they were protecting him.
[00:44:56.451 --> 00:44:57.372]  I'm trying to be nice.
[00:44:57.412 --> 00:44:58.893]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[00:45:00.194 --> 00:45:01.796]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[00:45:02.036 --> 00:45:03.818]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[00:45:03.878 --> 00:45:05.039]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[00:45:06.775 --> 00:45:09.216]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[00:45:09.336 --> 00:45:10.057]  It just doesn't work.
[00:45:10.097 --> 00:45:12.258]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[00:45:13.339 --> 00:45:15.220]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.981]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[00:45:19.182 --> 00:45:20.863]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[00:45:20.883 --> 00:45:24.565]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[00:45:24.845 --> 00:45:25.786]  Repeat after me.
[00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:28.627]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[00:45:28.687 --> 00:45:30.048]  That's not going to happen.
[00:45:30.588 --> 00:45:31.409]  So help me God.
[00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:33.070]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[00:45:39.142 --> 00:45:42.165]  We will make America great again!
[00:45:43.406 --> 00:45:44.447]  Go home to mommy.
[00:45:44.807 --> 00:45:46.028]  Tell her to tuck you in bed.
[00:45:46.288 --> 00:45:47.850]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[00:45:49.238 --> 00:45:50.459]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[00:45:50.479 --> 00:45:51.240]  We've carried them all.
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.141]  We sell them all.
[00:45:52.161 --> 00:45:52.922]  They're all groundbreaking.
[00:45:52.942 --> 00:45:54.703]  But this one, this one is fun.
[00:45:55.384 --> 00:45:56.645]  And very, very celebratory.
[00:45:56.685 --> 00:45:59.207]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[00:45:59.228 --> 00:46:00.068]  It's really a special film.
[00:46:01.149 --> 00:46:01.630]  Thanks a lot.
[00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:06.474]  Look, I urge everyone, you gotta get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[00:46:07.275 --> 00:46:09.958]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[00:46:10.598 --> 00:46:13.281]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[00:46:13.841 --> 00:46:26.365]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[00:46:26.645 --> 00:46:29.827]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[00:46:29.867 --> 00:46:30.847]  That's why it stuck.
[00:46:31.047 --> 00:46:36.069]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[00:46:36.209 --> 00:46:37.149]  I thought I knew Trump.
[00:46:37.249 --> 00:46:38.069]  I studied Trump.
[00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:39.230]  I thought I knew him.
[00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.551]  Only when you see this all back-to-back, how he reacts.
[00:46:43.131 --> 00:46:44.292]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.625 --> 00:47:23.329]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:29.315]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:29.435 --> 00:47:30.877]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:30.957 --> 00:47:38.225]  I'm Milo, standing in for Alex, and we are replacing fake news with fabulous news here, broadcasting live from Austin, Texas.
[00:47:38.885 --> 00:47:40.907]  Now before we get on to my favorite
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.522]  Wrong-headed ham planet, Michael Moore.
[00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:51.866]  Grotesque beast that he is, and we'll get to his latest indignity and humiliation in a moment.
[00:47:52.547 --> 00:47:55.569]  There is a limited sale on Cell Force by InfoWarsLife, 53% off.
[00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:57.510]  Why 53%, I don't know, but over half.
[00:48:00.748 --> 00:48:08.733]  Several years ago, InfoWars teamed up with Dr. Group to create DNA Force and other incredible InfoWars life formulas because they had outstanding standards.
[00:48:08.753 --> 00:48:16.818]  And after a few years of delivering these powerful formulas, InfoWars wanted to improve on DNA Force and its Bio-PQQ formula to help you get the rest for less.
[00:48:16.858 --> 00:48:17.779]  It's so persuasive, isn't it?
[00:48:17.819 --> 00:48:21.141]  You could sell me anything with this Bio-PQP.
[00:48:21.181 --> 00:48:21.801]  I just want it.
[00:48:21.981 --> 00:48:22.782]  I want to know what it is.
[00:48:23.282 --> 00:48:23.702]  I want it.
[00:48:23.882 --> 00:48:24.283]  I want to be
[00:48:25.023 --> 00:48:26.163]  I want to be improved by it.
[00:48:26.643 --> 00:48:30.804]  They found a way to make stronger, more affordable versions, but didn't want to compete against Dr. Group.
[00:48:30.864 --> 00:48:36.446]  So Dr. Group has given Infowars the go-ahead to create Cell Force.
[00:48:37.286 --> 00:48:41.067]  Cell Force is a formula that utilizes the best ingredients possible.
[00:48:41.547 --> 00:48:43.807]  Other formulas with these ingredients would cost up to $300.
[00:48:44.308 --> 00:48:51.209]  And while we would normally price this at $150, we're going even lower to $69.95, the last batch of Cell Force.
[00:48:51.669 --> 00:48:54.290]  If you like DNA Force, there's no better time to try the upgrade.
[00:48:55.677 --> 00:48:58.578]  Which is Cellforce.
[00:48:58.598 --> 00:48:58.738]  53% off.
[00:48:58.898 --> 00:49:01.159]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:49:01.279 --> 00:49:11.102]  Now, the more we learn about Russian interference in the election, or lack thereof, certainly lack of collusion with the Trump campaign, the more wonderful and amusing the story gets.
[00:49:11.723 --> 00:49:15.484]  Fabulously, and brilliantly, my favourite element of it so far,
[00:49:16.724 --> 00:49:23.711]  is a revelation that Russia organized and paid for an anti-Trump rally.
[00:49:24.252 --> 00:49:28.016]  It was in New York, outside Trump Tower, and who was there but who else?
[00:49:28.656 --> 00:49:33.421]  The reliably grotesque
[00:49:34.415 --> 00:49:34.915]  Michael Moore.
[00:49:34.935 --> 00:49:42.821]  We're going to play a little video of Michael Moore attempting to interview.
[00:49:43.061 --> 00:49:44.182]  He goes there for an encounter.
[00:49:44.242 --> 00:49:51.428]  He wants to sort of get people all riled up and have some hateful Trump campaigners spouting dreadful things at him.
[00:49:52.048 --> 00:49:59.133]  But here's a little video of what happens when he actually does confront a couple of women outside at this Russia-funded anti-Trump rally.
[00:49:59.173 --> 00:49:59.814]  Here's Michael Moore.
[00:50:00.362 --> 00:50:02.103]  I listen to your TV.
[00:50:02.163 --> 00:50:04.044]  You're the only one that said that.
[00:50:04.264 --> 00:50:05.885]  You thought it was going to happen.
[00:50:05.905 --> 00:50:06.385]  Yeah.
[00:50:06.786 --> 00:50:08.847]  Yeah, but a lot of good that does us, right?
[00:50:09.187 --> 00:50:10.808]  I don't feel good about it.
[00:50:11.168 --> 00:50:12.409]  I mean, I wanted to be wrong.
[00:50:12.669 --> 00:50:13.249]  We're hopeful.
[00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:14.170]  You're hopeful?
[00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.550]  Good.
[00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:15.571]  Where are you from?
[00:50:15.691 --> 00:50:16.091]  Georgia.
[00:50:16.791 --> 00:50:17.252]  Georgia, yeah.
[00:50:17.272 --> 00:50:19.314]  It's a rural area where we live.
[00:50:19.494 --> 00:50:20.615]  It's getting better in Georgia, right?
[00:50:21.095 --> 00:50:23.097]  You're on Facebook Live, by the way.
[00:50:23.317 --> 00:50:24.458]  We're very hopeful.
[00:50:24.478 --> 00:50:25.599]  We're excited.
[00:50:25.659 --> 00:50:27.161]  We need more jobs.
[00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:28.862]  They're lovely, these ladies.
[00:50:28.882 --> 00:50:29.543]  They're sweet.
[00:50:29.603 --> 00:50:30.143]  They're nice.
[00:50:30.203 --> 00:50:30.944]  They're reasonable.
[00:50:30.964 --> 00:50:36.769]  They're just normal Trump supporters out to support their candidate for president.
[00:50:36.809 --> 00:50:39.332]  He's out there trying to cause trouble.
[00:50:39.672 --> 00:50:40.933]  I would not have voted for Bernie, no.
[00:50:42.742 --> 00:50:46.464]  I don't know if it was Barney.
[00:50:46.584 --> 00:50:51.666]  We wanted a strong leader and we feel like jobs are very important.
[00:50:51.686 --> 00:50:59.149]  In our area, we have a lot of industry that has left and we have a lot of people that want to work, that are looking for jobs to come back.
[00:50:59.249 --> 00:51:01.730]  What makes you think he's going to do that?
[00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:06.135]  I think he can, because he's created jobs.
[00:51:06.435 --> 00:51:09.359]  I have more hope in him than any of the others.
[00:51:09.379 --> 00:51:09.900]  We don't know.
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.343]  But if he doesn't, then what are you going to do?
[00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:13.124]  Oh, give me a break.
[00:51:13.144 --> 00:51:14.987]  That's enough of that copulent mess.
[00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:29.378]  Michael Moore trying desperately to go out there and get some shocking footage of these terrible hateful Trump supporters and what he finds instead is perfectly reasonable normal people who are worried about the economy and jobs.
[00:51:30.678 --> 00:51:31.839]  What if he doesn't do it?
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.982]  Possibly beneath us but no less entertaining for that is the related
[00:51:40.205 --> 00:51:47.354]  The related searches for Michael Moore on Facebook, which my attention has just been drawn to, which will pop up on the screen.
[00:51:48.195 --> 00:51:55.403]  If you look at Michael Moore, the related searches are a delight.
[00:51:55.683 --> 00:51:56.865]  You'll get things like pizza...
[00:51:59.628 --> 00:52:06.090]  Imagine the worst things that people tweet about Michael Moore is what they're searching for on Facebook in relation to him.
[00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.890]  It's great.
[00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:22.056]  Now before we get to the end of the first hour, let's just return to Florida for a second and to the NBC clip that I alluded to earlier which shows gun owners destroying their own guns.
[00:52:22.516 --> 00:52:28.698]  NBC of course is delighted by this because they see this as the counterpoint, as the revenge.
[00:52:29.875 --> 00:52:39.443]  Two early eclipses of similar looking people, let's put it like that, burning their NFL season tickets.
[00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:51.272]  Now the emotive arguments, the appeals to pity and sorrow and empathy are persuading people to do dumb things.
[00:52:52.453 --> 00:52:54.234]  Literally dismantle their own freedoms.
[00:52:55.035 --> 00:52:56.196]  Take their guns apart.
[00:52:57.884 --> 00:53:21.758]  And here's a video where NBC is delighted to watch that, crowing about the erosion of the Second Amendment and gun-toting Laura Biden Americans giving up on one of the most important principles on which the freedom and security and stability of this great nation depends, their right to defend themselves against the tyranny of government and against marauding
[00:53:23.129 --> 00:53:29.131]  Fellow citizens, here's an NBC clip of a man dismantling his own weapon.
[00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:39.753]  As she watched the horrifying images of the Parkland shooting, gun owner Amanda Meyer of Connecticut says she needed to do something, so she destroyed her handgun.
[00:53:40.393 --> 00:53:44.514]  I hope that some people are inspired by it, at least, that they would go out and do the same thing.
[00:53:45.015 --> 00:53:49.316]  In North Carolina, Mike Russell handed over his AR-15 to law enforcement.
[00:53:49.436 --> 00:53:50.616]  He bought it as a hobby,
[00:53:50.996 --> 00:54:00.848]  But, as I see more and more AR-15s being part of mass shootings, I don't want to be a part of that.
[00:54:01.369 --> 00:54:07.536]  On social media, some gun owners are getting rid of their rifles and posting pictures under the hashtag one less gun.
[00:54:08.417 --> 00:54:11.460]  I'm gonna make sure this weapon will never be able to take a life.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:21.029]  It all started with a Facebook video viewed more than 17 million times of a self-described responsible gun owner with a faded tattoo of the right to bear arms.
[00:54:21.369 --> 00:54:24.552]  So moved by the Florida shooting that he sliced his AR-15.
[00:54:27.734 --> 00:54:34.137]  The NRA has called the AR-15 the most popular rifle in the U.S., owned by 8 million Americans.
[00:54:34.418 --> 00:54:37.679]  Enthusiasts say it's customizable, accurate, and versatile.
[00:54:37.859 --> 00:54:40.821]  But it's become the weapon of choice in mass killings.
[00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:47.284]  Marcos Avalon is a certified NRA instructor who says banning AR-15s is a mistake.
[00:54:47.444 --> 00:54:48.204]  It's a scapegoating.
[00:54:48.444 --> 00:54:50.105]  There's gonna be another mass shooting right afterwards.
[00:54:50.645 --> 00:54:53.927]  So I don't see where the solution is coming from with that.
[00:54:54.429 --> 00:55:03.853]  Tonight, there is a renewed debate among gun owners themselves over the extent of the Second Amendment when it comes to AR-15s, and whether the right is worth the risk.
[00:55:04.153 --> 00:55:08.115]  You hear that little thing that was just snuck in there?
[00:55:08.135 --> 00:55:10.656]  The extent of the Second Amendment.
[00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:13.497]  What is the extent of an inalienable right?
[00:55:13.798 --> 00:55:15.258]  It's like being a bit pregnant.
[00:55:16.339 --> 00:55:19.920]  What's the extent of the Second Amendment?
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.041]  There's no extent of the Second Amendment.
[00:55:22.101 --> 00:55:23.622]  You're just allowed to have guns.
[00:55:26.084 --> 00:55:30.505]  What kind of world do these people who are disarming America's citizens want to bring about?
[00:55:30.545 --> 00:55:43.547]  Well, it's a world in which kids cannot protect themselves from being stabbed by Syrian immigrant classmates and African men imported to Paris engaging in cannibalism.
[00:55:44.588 --> 00:55:48.488]  These are the sorts of cultures the left wants to bring into your nation.
[00:55:48.528 --> 00:55:51.289]  These are the sorts of people
[00:55:52.298 --> 00:55:56.863]  That America's liberals want roaming the streets at the same time as disarming you.
[00:55:57.243 --> 00:55:59.906]  That's two stories that are chilling.
[00:56:00.086 --> 00:56:10.196]  A 15-year-old Lithuanian baby boy, Arminas Pilekas, murdered in the school by a 14-year-old classmate from a family of Syrian refugees.
[00:56:10.236 --> 00:56:12.679]  This happened, of course, in Sweden.
[00:56:12.759 --> 00:56:13.139]  Where else?
[00:56:14.266 --> 00:56:18.289]  No jail time, no punishment for the Syrian kid because he's too young.
[00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:19.470]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:21.872]  You know, when you grow up in a war zone, you grow up fast.
[00:56:21.932 --> 00:56:24.054]  And 15-year-olds are not the same everywhere.
[00:56:24.074 --> 00:56:37.484]  A 15-year-old brought up in a cosseted feminist paradise, like Sweden, is quite different from a 15-year-old who's had to go out and work to make sure the family could be fed.
[00:56:38.485 --> 00:56:42.388]  They bring imports into Sweden, stabbing their classmates over you-know-what.
[00:56:44.431 --> 00:56:51.854]  And the worst story of the week, African men arrested in Paris for cannibalism in the suburbs.
[00:56:54.235 --> 00:57:00.997]  Some imports from Cape Verde arrested on Sunday after they attacked a man who was walking in the Hector Berlioz alley.
[00:57:01.617 --> 00:57:05.859]  They bit off pieces of his ear and his lower lip.
[00:57:06.219 --> 00:57:13.562]  Clichy-sur-bois, it was the suburb and it's becoming well known as a no-go zone in Paris.
[00:57:15.151 --> 00:57:15.511]  That's it.
[00:57:15.571 --> 00:57:22.035]  That's the glorious future that liberals who want to take away your guns want you to welcome in.
[00:57:22.295 --> 00:57:30.720]  The European and Scandinavian worlds of cannibalism and dead kids and no Second Amendment to protect you.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.542]  And there's NBC talking about the extent of the Second Amendment.
[00:57:34.602 --> 00:57:39.906]  Just the first step taking it from an inalienable right to a movable one.
[00:57:40.186 --> 00:57:42.647]  Just the first step to eradicating it entirely.
[00:57:42.947 --> 00:57:43.708]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:57:52.748 --> 00:58:04.293]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[00:58:04.333 --> 00:58:05.294]  We're exposed to lead.
[00:58:05.314 --> 00:58:06.354]  We're exposed to mercury.
[00:58:06.374 --> 00:58:11.376]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[00:58:11.757 --> 00:58:16.759]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[00:58:16.859 --> 00:58:18.980]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.161]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[00:58:21.301 --> 00:58:24.924]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[00:58:25.024 --> 00:58:30.009]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[00:58:30.389 --> 00:58:35.873]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:58:36.234 --> 00:58:41.458]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:42.758]  And over and over again.
[00:58:42.818 --> 00:58:49.721]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[00:58:49.941 --> 00:58:52.122]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[00:58:52.142 --> 00:58:53.783]  I mean, this is so massive.
[00:58:53.863 --> 00:59:07.269]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland in men.
[00:59:07.289 --> 00:59:07.829]  Fertility is key.
[00:59:08.389 --> 00:59:18.575]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually.
[00:59:18.615 --> 00:59:24.999]  The whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[00:59:25.379 --> 00:59:29.382]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[00:59:29.402 --> 00:59:32.964]  When you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying.
[00:59:33.464 --> 00:59:34.805]  All of a sudden, it was like, boom!
[00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:38.347]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:11.372 --> 01:00:21.382]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:22.203 --> 01:00:24.125]  Welcome back.
[01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:29.650]  This is the center of the resistance, as we like to say down here in Austin.
[01:00:30.271 --> 01:00:30.992]  I'm Miley Nopoulos.
[01:00:32.173 --> 01:00:34.916]  We're entering the era of big trans.
[01:00:36.647 --> 01:00:52.871]  If you're wondering what that interesting expression means, a new report suggests that transgender ideology is being powered by 400 million dollars from business and advocates.
[01:00:53.732 --> 01:00:58.353]  Transgender activists are of course the craziest people in the world.
[01:00:58.713 --> 01:01:01.254]  Now there are people who suffer from this
[01:01:02.774 --> 01:01:03.774]  Horrifying condition.
[01:01:04.354 --> 01:01:06.595]  Not nearly as many as who are diagnosed with it.
[01:01:07.975 --> 01:01:15.057]  But the question of the transgender lobby isn't about medical ethics or treatment pathways.
[01:01:16.737 --> 01:01:23.119]  The problem is that it has become entirely a political virtue signaling performance act.
[01:01:24.912 --> 01:01:43.279]  And it's become, as Time Magazine crowned it, the new civil rights frontier, with a predictable result that expressing the correct opinion about the trans issue has become the new litmus test for whether or not you're the right kind of person, whether or not you are acceptable for polite society.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:52.403]  If there was any doubt that the trans lobby is just a bunch of underprivileged, desperately miserable and
[01:01:53.985 --> 01:02:00.029]  Highly vulnerable, in need activists armed with little but Twitter accounts and their powers of persuasion.
[01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:20.582]  That has been conclusively debunked by a report that has tracked the flow of pro-transgender funding via donors and business groups to reveal that $400 million has now been spent by professional activists to allow men to wander into women's bathrooms.
[01:02:22.099 --> 01:02:33.494]  To punish, to ritually humiliate, abuse, intimidate, bully and punish those of us who believe that medicine should not play second fiddle to political ideology.
[01:02:34.496 --> 01:02:35.337]  What do the studies show?
[01:02:35.497 --> 01:02:36.178]  They show that
[01:02:38.444 --> 01:02:44.750]  People who have this surgery have rates of regret that are astonishingly high.
[01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:59.062]  They show that the transition surgery that is being suggested for children by some doctors, doctors saying that prepubescent boys should be put on hormone blockers, this stuff
[01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:07.431]  It's very upsetting to anybody who has children, who is worried about their children being subject to this kind of ideology in schools.
[01:03:07.471 --> 01:03:21.153]  And I get emails from people who say, my kid's teacher in a public school is telling my child about transgenders because he picked up, you know, the wrong toy at playtime or whatever.
[01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:22.114]  They're excited by it.
[01:03:22.154 --> 01:03:23.174]  They're almost gleeful.
[01:03:23.474 --> 01:03:24.394]  They love this stuff.
[01:03:24.474 --> 01:03:26.254]  It's like, oh, I got one in my classroom.
[01:03:27.495 --> 01:03:27.935]  It's sick.
[01:03:28.015 --> 01:03:28.555]  It's horrible.
[01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:36.100]  What the studies show is that people who have this surgery don't get better.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.260]  It doesn't help them.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:40.701]  The depression rates and the suicide rates don't improve.
[01:03:40.841 --> 01:03:48.043]  If anything, one particular set of data suggests that they get worse, as well as the regret rates.
[01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:50.164]  We had a caller on the show yesterday who said, don't do it.
[01:03:50.984 --> 01:03:54.205]  But this is the new political orthodoxy and it's not just
[01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:59.345]  Activists, well-funded and hysterical online.
[01:03:59.945 --> 01:04:02.126]  This is now the era of big trans.
[01:04:02.146 --> 01:04:19.735]  There's big money to be made if you are a sufficiently woke activist appealing to big business and appealing to private donors to push a particular kind, a particularly sociopathic and disgusting kind of political
[01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:27.010]  Activism masquerading as medical care, as tolerance, diversity and niceness.
[01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:29.115]  Niceness being the great cancer of our age.
[01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:31.311]  It's the era of big trends.
[01:04:31.651 --> 01:04:37.295]  They're coming for you, and you best express the right opinion, because if you don't, you could lose your job, you could lose your friends.
[01:04:37.535 --> 01:04:49.143]  It is professionally disastrous and socially horrifying to step outside the consensus, the media-created consensus, and now there's a hell of a lot of money behind it, making sure that you stay in line.
[01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:50.684]  The era of big trends.
[01:04:51.004 --> 01:04:51.905]  We'll be right back after this.
[01:04:56.732 --> 01:04:56.812]  Yeah.
[01:05:03.697 --> 01:05:08.440]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:14.244]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:23.390]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.

[01:05:59.907 --> 01:06:02.728]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:04.619 --> 01:06:09.646]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:06:12.214 --> 01:06:30.060]  Obviously this is a really tough tragedy to deal with, but I just wanted to talk to you about your perspective from a sheriff's standpoint with gun control and ask you how much of your call for gun control is rooted in your actual want for gun control as a sheriff, and how much is driven by your own political ideology as a registered Democrat?
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.561]  I don't have any political ideologies.
[01:06:32.661 --> 01:06:34.422]  I just do what's right for the community.
[01:06:35.842 --> 01:06:37.483]  Yeah.
[01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:39.345]  Yeah.
[01:07:06.743 --> 01:07:10.927]  That's the video from Laura Loomer confronting the sheriff.
[01:07:11.806 --> 01:07:13.767]  Near the Florida shooting, very tragic.
[01:07:13.827 --> 01:07:32.316]  Before the break, we were talking about the era of Big Trans, a new study that shows that $400 million has been used to indoctrinate the American population on the subject of transgenderism, replacing medical ethics and science with political ideology.
[01:07:32.396 --> 01:07:35.538]  Parents now being punished if they are insufficiently woke.
[01:07:37.699 --> 01:07:38.560]  On the trans question.
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.481]  This is the new era of big trans.
[01:07:40.741 --> 01:07:45.604]  But joining us is Laura Loomer, our intrepid reporter from the ground in Florida.
[01:07:45.644 --> 01:07:46.765]  Hello Pumpkin, how are you?
[01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:48.451]  I'm doing well.
[01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:49.191]  How are you, Milo?
[01:07:49.692 --> 01:07:50.152]  I'm good.
[01:07:50.452 --> 01:07:58.019]  Now, the sound on our sheriff video was not perfect, so give us a quick recap on what the sheriff told you about gun control.
[01:07:58.039 --> 01:08:06.446]  And then I want to ask you about some of the other stories that are coming out of that area, and also, of course, about the ongoing controversy in the media about these kids.
[01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:10.650]  What was the sheriff's line on gun control when you asked him?
[01:08:11.394 --> 01:08:19.517]  Well, I went to a memorial site and I saw the sheriff walking around, so I found him and had to ambush him.
[01:08:19.938 --> 01:08:24.459]  So the sheriff basically told me, I don't have a political ideology.
[01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:28.161]  I just do what's best for the community, which is absolute garbage, right?
[01:08:28.201 --> 01:08:32.323]  Because this guy ran on the Democratic ticket to become the sheriff of Broward County.
[01:08:32.743 --> 01:08:40.586]  And not only that, but he's spotted in multiple pictures rubbing elbows with Hillary Clinton, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden.
[01:08:40.606 --> 01:08:41.687]  All of your favorites.
[01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:43.609]  All of your favorite people.
[01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:49.474]  And so then what happened is at the end of the interview he walked away from me because he was pretty annoyed with me.
[01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:59.723]  So I followed him and I wouldn't let him get away and I shoved my camera in his face again and I said, you say you don't have an etiology but you're seen in pictures with Hillary and Debbie.
[01:09:00.043 --> 01:09:00.684]  What's up with that?
[01:09:00.744 --> 01:09:04.507]  And he got really angry and gave me the whole, ma'am, ma'am, this interview is over.
[01:09:06.032 --> 01:09:07.693]  Just like Sheriff Lombardo in Vegas.
[01:09:07.713 --> 01:09:12.254]  So I really am getting a reputation for being the most hated journalist among America's sheriffs.
[01:09:13.014 --> 01:09:19.736]  You're not going to get any sexy law enforcement boyfriends anytime soon, Laura.
[01:09:20.176 --> 01:09:22.057]  Also, Milo, I want to add as well.
[01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:30.380]  I asked him, I said, so your rhetoric and the department's rhetoric and the community's rhetoric is very anti-Trump.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.221]  When are you going to hold the FBI accountable for dropping the ball?
[01:09:33.241 --> 01:09:34.461]  Do you agree that they're responsible?
[01:09:34.801 --> 01:09:40.544]  And he literally said, oh, I don't think that anyone is responsible besides the shooters.
[01:09:40.604 --> 01:09:50.690]  So this sheriff is so out of touch with reality and is, you know, so unwilling to admit the truth that he's willing to contradict what the official FBI statement said.
[01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:56.493]  Even the FBI released a statement saying that they were responsible for this, that they dropped the ball.
[01:09:56.553 --> 01:09:59.535]  So the fact that the sheriff just wants to continue with this
[01:09:59.875 --> 01:10:05.102]  With this false narrative that the shooter was responsible and only responsible for this?
[01:10:05.162 --> 01:10:06.404]  I mean, he's out of control.
[01:10:07.779 --> 01:10:15.461]  People are starting to feel the consequences of stepping out of line and the official version of events here.
[01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:23.962]  Now I want to be careful about what we say, the words we use and the allegations that we're making and stick strictly to what we know for sure and we can prove.
[01:10:24.382 --> 01:10:33.744]  But many people have noticed that something's a little off about some of the testimony from the students who emerged after the shooting.
[01:10:35.012 --> 01:10:37.874]  And for discussing that, at least one person has lost their job.
[01:10:37.995 --> 01:10:41.417]  Florida lawmaker Aide has been fired.
[01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:44.700]  He's an aide to Sean Harrison, a Republican down in Tampa.
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:48.403]  He was fired for emailing the Tampa Bay Times the following.
[01:10:48.783 --> 01:10:55.068]  Both kids in the picture are not students here, but actors that travel to various... You know the message.
[01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:00.953]  We don't know anything for sure.
[01:11:01.033 --> 01:11:05.776]  What people are doing is asking questions because they've noticed something slightly odd.
[01:11:06.337 --> 01:11:12.902]  I happened to find the Twitter stream of the leading girl in this movement, the one who's supposedly organising the march.
[01:11:12.922 --> 01:11:14.063]  Of course she's doing no such thing.
[01:11:14.883 --> 01:11:41.404]  To be very peculiar, and it reminds me of Malala Yousafzai, the young hijabed Muslim girl, of course with the UN dad, they've always got a parent in law enforcement or a parent in some globalist institution, who had lines fed to her by her father and read scripted responses out to try to persuade the international community that of course Islam has nothing to do with terrorism and blah blah blah.
[01:11:44.056 --> 01:12:06.569]  Talk to us about, not necessarily about the allegation that these kids are being stitched up and we're going to find out the truth on that, but what does it say about America that we've gone from a country that used to pretty rigorously defend free speech to one in which sites of shootings are demolished
[01:12:07.918 --> 01:12:10.940]  to cover up any ability of the public to judge for themselves what happened.
[01:12:11.381 --> 01:12:18.786]  Intelligence agencies are silent or, you know, not complicit, at least negligent and unapologetic.
[01:12:19.307 --> 01:12:23.930]  And people who question the official version of events are forced out from their jobs.
[01:12:24.611 --> 01:12:24.931]  What is it?
[01:12:25.652 --> 01:12:26.152]  What is it all?
[01:12:26.272 --> 01:12:26.813]  What's going on?
[01:12:28.223 --> 01:12:48.526]  Well, you know, I think that the idea of calling something a false flag or calling something, you know, not 100% real or really challenging the official narrative is becoming more mainstream, really, and thanks to people like Alex Jones and yourself who are making it more culturally acceptable to question authority figures.
[01:12:48.986 --> 01:12:55.909]  And, you know, we always saw with these tragedies in the past that it was very taboo to even open your mouth about it and you would get, you know, shunned immediately.
[01:12:55.949 --> 01:13:06.293]  But now, you know, at least I would say almost half the country or really majority of the country is really starting to see that when these events take place, we're not getting the truth.
[01:13:06.533 --> 01:13:06.753]  Yeah.
[01:13:25.271 --> 01:13:33.034]  Uh, you know, an actor, whether or not you believe he's an actor or not, but the thing that I find most concerning about this student is the fact that his father is an FBI agent.
[01:13:33.334 --> 01:13:45.039]  Because it really makes you wonder if CNN, in combination with our intelligence agencies, is using this child as a prop to push forward anti-Trump rhetoric from the Bureau and the mainstream media.
[01:13:45.539 --> 01:13:48.464]  And, you know, I'm not really concerned as to whether he's a student there.
[01:13:48.544 --> 01:13:56.879]  I'm really concerned about how the FBI and CNN are using them in their efforts to undermine President Trump and other Republicans.
[01:13:57.472 --> 01:14:01.633]  And it's remarkable the extent to which this debate is becoming fact-free.
[01:14:02.153 --> 01:14:10.276]  There are numerous examples now springing up from all over the world about how to deal with this kind of thing effectively.
[01:14:10.436 --> 01:14:15.057]  Israel, for instance, after a school shooting, after a tragedy there, instituted armed teachers.
[01:14:20.299 --> 01:14:21.580]  And there have been no shootings since.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.921]  And this is in, you know, I mean, all of Israel is a perpetual war zone.
[01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:28.762]  You know, I mean, it's Tel Aviv, which is relatively peaceful most of the time, of course.
[01:14:28.822 --> 01:14:31.503]  But, you know, there are examples now.
[01:14:31.524 --> 01:14:37.386]  There's clear evidence for what Second Amendment advocates have been saying for some time, which is just arm the teachers.
[01:14:37.626 --> 01:14:38.426]  That's what they did in Israel.
[01:14:38.546 --> 01:14:39.066]  It works.
[01:14:39.527 --> 01:14:47.070]  But law enforcement is so, it seems to me, so co-opted by the leftist, you know,
[01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:49.851]  Globalist, Democrat, vision of the world.
[01:14:49.931 --> 01:14:55.353]  So united in hostility and opposition to the president, to guns, to everything.
[01:14:56.793 --> 01:14:59.634]  It's remarkable to hear a sheriff.
[01:15:00.854 --> 01:15:02.635]  I guess they're elected officials with a badge, right?
[01:15:02.655 --> 01:15:05.616]  They're not really like regular police officers.
[01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:07.457]  They're more like politicians, really.
[01:15:08.257 --> 01:15:10.298]  But it's remarkable to see somebody in a police badge.
[01:15:12.654 --> 01:15:17.061]  Spreading opinions and sharing views that are so obviously counterfactual.
[01:15:17.421 --> 01:15:26.735]  We've entered the realm now of emotion versus emotion, and whoever can tell the best story and tug on the greatest heartstrings is going to win factual debate.
[01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.898]  Seems to me a very worrying state of affairs, right?
[01:15:30.413 --> 01:15:31.274]  Yeah, no, and I agree.
[01:15:31.314 --> 01:15:45.623]  And if you're going to have the nerve to use your position as an authority figure, whether you be a sheriff or a politician, to use children and exploited tragedy to push liberal propaganda, you should have the nerve and the balls to talk to a reporter who asks you questions when a camera is shoved in your face.
[01:15:45.643 --> 01:15:46.724]  Quite right, Sue.
[01:15:47.044 --> 01:15:48.725]  We have to go to break.
[01:15:48.805 --> 01:15:52.828]  If you'd like to hang on just for a second afterwards, I'll ask you about a couple of other things.
[01:15:52.868 --> 01:15:53.449]  That's all right, Laura.
[01:15:53.509 --> 01:15:53.989]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:03.304 --> 01:16:05.265]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:16:05.285 --> 01:16:05.705]  Go ahead.
[01:16:05.986 --> 01:16:08.207]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:16:08.227 --> 01:16:11.229]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:13.191]  It just gets old, man.
[01:16:13.491 --> 01:16:14.772]  I'm gonna shut you down right now.
[01:16:15.912 --> 01:16:17.994]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:16:18.234 --> 01:16:22.237]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:16:22.257 --> 01:16:24.679]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:16:25.559 --> 01:16:27.881]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:16:28.241 --> 01:16:29.302]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:16:29.582 --> 01:16:30.463]  Us being shut down?
[01:16:30.703 --> 01:16:31.763]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:16:32.184 --> 01:16:33.224]  You know what, Alex?
[01:16:33.244 --> 01:16:34.345]  Put him on pause again.
[01:16:34.365 --> 01:16:35.186]  Hey, Frank!
[01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:40.810]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:45.413]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:16:45.653 --> 01:16:48.515]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:49.155]  You understand?
[01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:50.516]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:16:50.897 --> 01:16:52.017]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:16:52.998 --> 01:16:57.884]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:17:07.895 --> 01:17:08.916]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[01:17:09.136 --> 01:17:12.599]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.221]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:15.062]  They're suing me.
[01:17:15.302 --> 01:17:16.503]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[01:17:16.984 --> 01:17:18.765]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:20.167]  We were bringing five million in a year.
[01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:21.428]  It cost a lot to run this.
[01:17:21.588 --> 01:17:23.470]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:25.311]  I keep growing more as fast as I can.
[01:17:25.672 --> 01:17:28.454]  And as fast as I cut them off, I'm shooting out tentacles.
[01:17:28.735 --> 01:17:30.276]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[01:17:30.316 --> 01:17:30.877]  Tell him right there.
[01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:31.157]  Frank!
[01:17:31.437 --> 01:17:31.997]  Hey, Frank!
[01:17:32.257 --> 01:17:33.498]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[01:17:33.918 --> 01:17:37.599]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention.
[01:17:37.639 --> 01:17:39.120]  Although, of course, everybody likes a little bit of attention.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:39.500]  It's nice.
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:50.003]  But I can't do TV, and I can't do radio, and I can't publish books, and I can't sell anything, and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... We're the heretics!
[01:17:50.123 --> 01:17:52.884]  Yeah, exactly, using every resource at their disposal.
[01:17:52.924 --> 01:17:54.145]  So it's not bragging.
[01:17:54.245 --> 01:17:56.786]  It's a daily reality, and that's why you've got to support things like InfoWars and
[01:17:57.426 --> 01:17:59.607]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[01:17:59.627 --> 01:18:00.147]  We're doing it now.

[01:18:15.273 --> 01:18:15.533]  Listen.
[01:18:17.774 --> 01:18:18.895]  Everybody wants somebody to fight?
[01:18:19.415 --> 01:18:20.055]  We're fighting!
[01:18:20.315 --> 01:18:21.636]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[01:18:21.716 --> 01:18:25.959]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass, but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.
[01:18:26.299 --> 01:18:29.781]  If you make examples of us and fund us, we will be victorious and you win.
[01:18:29.801 --> 01:18:30.581]  Do you understand?
[01:18:30.701 --> 01:18:31.782]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:18:33.151 --> 01:18:40.856]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:45.759]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.621]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:18:49.402 --> 01:18:52.524]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:18:54.045 --> 01:19:06.173]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:19:06.853 --> 01:19:21.943]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[01:20:05.965 --> 01:20:12.207]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.508 --> 01:20:22.510]  Yet our best trained, best educated, best equipped, best prepared troops refuse to fight.
[01:20:23.211 --> 01:20:30.053]  Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch than fight.
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:32.501]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:32.941 --> 01:20:35.923]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:20:39.265 --> 01:20:41.346]  Never were truer words spoken.
[01:20:41.386 --> 01:20:46.549]  There is a war on for everyone's mind in the Florida shooting.
[01:20:46.569 --> 01:20:49.651]  I'm here with Laura Loomer who is in Florida for InfoWars.
[01:20:49.991 --> 01:20:52.632]  Now CNN reporters who are down there
[01:20:54.353 --> 01:21:05.223]  Are taking the opportunity not just to spread propaganda about gun control, but to harass pensioners for the crime of supporting Trump on Facebook.
[01:21:05.263 --> 01:21:12.909]  CNN showed up in Broward County, presumably they were down there already for the Florida thing, and showed up at an old lady's home.
[01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.642]  Because she runs a Facebook group about Trump.
[01:21:17.302 --> 01:21:21.424]  They showed up at the old lady's home.
[01:21:21.464 --> 01:21:31.227]  Gruen Goldfarb runs the Team Trump Broward County Facebook page, which CNN claims posted numerous times about events that were promoted and encouraged by the Russians.
[01:21:31.407 --> 01:21:33.468]  Oh, you mean like Michael Moore's anti-Trump?
[01:21:34.188 --> 01:21:36.190]  Extravaganza outside Trump Tower.
[01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:36.710]  Give me a break.
[01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:39.392]  I'm going to get Laura Loomer's take on this after we play the clip.
[01:21:40.092 --> 01:21:50.959]  This clip is CNN showing up at an old lady's home to harass her about so-called Russian collusion because she runs a Facebook page about Trump on the internet.
[01:21:50.999 --> 01:21:51.500]  Here's the clip.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:54.782]  What part of it in this is a cover-up?
[01:21:54.942 --> 01:21:57.524]  Are you saying that's not true or what?
[01:21:59.232 --> 01:21:59.852]  The Russians?
[01:22:00.073 --> 01:22:03.574]  I don't care if they were involved or not.
[01:22:03.654 --> 01:22:06.095]  That, to me, is the least important thing.
[01:22:06.115 --> 01:22:07.675]  But they were involved with you.
[01:22:08.196 --> 01:22:09.176]  Did you guys know that?
[01:22:10.376 --> 01:22:11.857]  They weren't involved with us.
[01:22:11.937 --> 01:22:15.418]  You know, just make sure that you report it correctly.
[01:22:15.739 --> 01:22:18.139]  But you guys were involved with Being Patriotic, right?
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.960]  Very, very patriotic.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:26.943]  Being Patriotic was the group that contacted and helped organize some of these activities that you posted on your own Facebook account.
[01:22:28.121 --> 01:22:29.283]  Those were legitimate.
[01:22:29.623 --> 01:22:30.524]  Those were Russians.
[01:22:31.084 --> 01:22:32.046]  They were not Russians.
[01:22:32.166 --> 01:22:33.527]  I don't go with the Russians.
[01:22:33.727 --> 01:22:34.989]  Look at that, my goodness.
[01:22:35.029 --> 01:22:36.390]  You can leave it there.
[01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:38.773]  Laura, what do you think about this?
[01:22:38.793 --> 01:22:40.034]  CNN rocking up.
[01:22:40.054 --> 01:22:41.736]  I love the dogs in the background.
[01:22:41.816 --> 01:22:43.818]  She's out there just like, what are you doing?
[01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:44.839]  Who are you?
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.421]  This lovely old lady.
[01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:57.607]  Meanwhile, while they're telling us, you know, not to believe in conspiracy theories and how dare we and calm it down and stop it, they're harassing an old lady about Russian collusion.
[01:22:57.748 --> 01:22:58.468]  Poor old dear.
[01:22:58.508 --> 01:22:59.469]  You should go and talk to her.
[01:22:59.689 --> 01:23:00.149]  What do you think?
[01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:06.053]  Well, you know, I just want to let her know there is the stand your ground policy in Florida.
[01:23:09.159 --> 01:23:11.400]  I would say, I would say, Faye, you know what?
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:15.822]  I think that, I would say, so stand your ground, you know the Castle Doctrine.
[01:23:16.142 --> 01:23:21.604]  All you have to establish is that you are genuinely in fear of your life or property.
[01:23:21.724 --> 01:23:30.147]  Well, I would say the presence of CNN reporters represents a clear and present danger to my family's security.
[01:23:30.187 --> 01:23:30.667]  There we go.
[01:23:30.707 --> 01:23:32.228]  That's why she gets the big bucks.
[01:23:32.268 --> 01:23:32.748]  Great answer.
[01:23:33.028 --> 01:23:34.949]  Thanks for spending some time with us, Laura, today.
[01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:40.770]  CNN reporters on your property, representing a clear and present danger.
[01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:47.872]  Just, you know, as a health note to our Floridian viewers, don't pull your gun on reporters.
[01:23:48.393 --> 01:23:49.233]  Whatever you do.
[01:23:49.393 --> 01:23:52.114]  Now, moving on, Professor Snowflake.
[01:23:52.834 --> 01:23:59.756]  It isn't just students in America who are getting their feelings hurt and getting very, very, very upset about it.
[01:24:01.638 --> 01:24:11.444]  A professor in one of America's higher education establishments claims to have had their entire holiday ruined over an op-ed about free speech.
[01:24:11.504 --> 01:24:14.826]  Now you'll remember we talked yesterday about a story that was published on philly.com.
[01:24:15.846 --> 01:24:29.975]  It's a very erudite piece, it's interesting, it's a thought-provoking, by no means rabble-rousing piece about the erosion of bourgeois values in America and the resulting consequence for culture.
[01:24:30.615 --> 01:24:31.296]  You'll remember that.
[01:24:31.756 --> 01:24:37.241]  Well, the author of that, who's a professor, is obviously quite right.
[01:24:37.662 --> 01:24:54.117]  And the way you know she's right is that the breakdown in masculinity, in male virtues, the attack on men, this idea of toxic masculinity that's run away, and men becoming increasingly less able to perform the functions that we traditionally associate with manhood.
[01:24:55.936 --> 01:24:56.676]  We know it's true.
[01:24:57.057 --> 01:24:57.257]  Why?
[01:24:57.277 --> 01:25:13.366]  A report out just this week that says that the armed forces, the army, cannot get enough recruits who are actually eligible to join the military because people are doing too many drugs, people are, you know, all kinds of bad lifestyle choices brought about by the crisis in masculinity.
[01:25:13.406 --> 01:25:15.828]  Well anyway, she's writing about all this stuff.
[01:25:16.228 --> 01:25:22.952]  Fat, unhealthy Americans threatening Trump's defense surge thanks to a breakdown in the country's bourgeois culture, that sense of discipline.
[01:25:23.412 --> 01:25:24.433]  Anyway, her op-ed
[01:25:25.575 --> 01:25:31.876]  Which was anti-political correctness, has caused an uproar at the University of Pennsylvania.
[01:25:32.396 --> 01:25:37.917]  She says, her name is Amy Wax, some cultures are better than others and I don't shrink from the word superior.
[01:25:38.538 --> 01:25:41.518]  And here's what she told the Wall Street Journal after it happened.
[01:25:42.058 --> 01:25:50.880]  Shortly after my op-ed appeared, and remember this is a perfectly reasonable, you know, mild-mannered op-ed, I ran into a colleague I hadn't seen for a while and asked how his summer was going.
[01:25:52.581 --> 01:25:57.465]  He said he'd had a terrible summer and I'm saying he looked so serious I thought someone had died.
[01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:06.113]  He then explained that the reason his summer had been ruined was my op-ed and he accused me of attacking and causing damage to the university students and the faculty.
[01:26:06.633 --> 01:26:09.515]  One of my left-leaning friends at Yale Law School found this story funny.
[01:26:10.296 --> 01:26:13.377]  Who would have guessed an op-ed could ruin someone's summer?
[01:26:13.917 --> 01:26:16.218]  But beyond the absurdity, note the choice of words.
[01:26:16.358 --> 01:26:22.901]  Attack and damage are words that you typically use with your enemies, not colleagues or fellow citizens.
[01:26:23.561 --> 01:26:31.264]  At the very least, they're not words that encourage the expression of unpopular ideas, which is, of course, surely the purpose of higher education in the first place.
[01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:38.047]  Professor Wax, who wrote a very mild-mannered op-ed, which was anti-political correctness,
[01:26:39.264 --> 01:26:56.932]  Has now been asked by her dean, as a result of her colleagues feeling so attacked, personally victimized by someone expressing an opinion about the trajectory of American culture, has been asked by her dean to take a leave of absence and to cease teaching a mandatory first-year course.
[01:26:57.232 --> 01:27:02.915]  They're taking her away from students for the crime of expressing an opinion.
[01:27:03.695 --> 01:27:10.599]  He said the Dean said he was getting pressure to banish her for her unpopular points of view and hoped that her departure would quell the controversy.
[01:27:11.439 --> 01:27:24.946]  When Amy, Professor Amy, suggested it was his job as leader to resist such illiberal demands, he explained that he's a pluralistic Dean who must listen to and accommodate all sides.
[01:27:25.086 --> 01:27:28.328]  Well, presumably that means all sides on the left.
[01:27:29.348 --> 01:27:30.329]  Free speech is an under...
[01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:34.253]  Under unprecedented threats in crisis like never before.
[01:27:34.894 --> 01:27:36.897]  A free speech related story from Spain.
[01:27:36.957 --> 01:27:42.104]  Spanish rapper has been jailed for a song in which
[01:27:43.325 --> 01:27:46.006]  And some listeners are going to have disagreements with me on this one.
[01:27:46.686 --> 01:28:00.689]  This is a song in which he glorifies terrorism, and he says that the Palma de Maluca, which is a palace where Spanish royals live and spend their summer holidays, deserved an atom bomb, and people wanted the deaths of these pigs.
[01:28:00.789 --> 01:28:06.410]  The language of the rap, according to the judge, is extreme, provocative, allegorical, and symbolic.
[01:28:07.011 --> 01:28:07.591]  Well, you know what?
[01:28:07.611 --> 01:28:08.371]  It is horrible.
[01:28:09.091 --> 01:28:11.132]  It is horrible to glorify terrorists.
[01:28:11.572 --> 01:28:12.292]  It's stupid.
[01:28:13.112 --> 01:28:15.055]  To attack people for no reason.
[01:28:15.095 --> 01:28:16.818]  But it is also his right as an artist.
[01:28:16.878 --> 01:28:28.355]  And I know some people listening to this are going to react with revulsion and displeasure and horror at this, you know, undoubtedly ignorant loser's silly lyrics.
[01:28:30.077 --> 01:28:48.445]  But if you really want to go down the road of Europe, America, and start jailing people, not just for expressing opinions, but for creating art that reflects their political priorities, if you really want to go down that road where artists become jailed for wrong-think, you're going the right way about it.
[01:28:48.485 --> 01:28:49.726]  This is the path we're headed on.
[01:28:50.306 --> 01:28:55.869]  The erosion of the First Amendment just as bad as the attacks, thanks to Florida, on the second.
[01:28:56.029 --> 01:28:56.549]  We'll be right back.

[01:29:06.936 --> 01:29:14.337]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:29:15.037 --> 01:29:19.758]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:29:20.358 --> 01:29:22.259]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:29:22.879 --> 01:29:26.319]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:29:27.119 --> 01:29:29.580]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:36.924]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:29:37.524 --> 01:29:44.768]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:52.293]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:29:52.853 --> 01:29:53.933]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:29:54.314 --> 01:29:56.115]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:29:56.935 --> 01:29:59.898]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:30:00.438 --> 01:30:02.140]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:20.157 --> 01:30:21.819]  Well, just what you're doing now, Alex.
[01:30:21.979 --> 01:30:22.880]  I appreciate it.
[01:30:22.941 --> 01:30:27.767]  Putting that word out and motivating my base.
[01:30:28.187 --> 01:30:31.351]  I never lost a Republican primary.
[01:30:31.771 --> 01:30:33.494]  Even in the last election, I won by 40%.
[01:30:33.834 --> 01:30:38.360]  I'm a Republican primary, so I have strong support.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.041]  Across the state.
[01:30:40.661 --> 01:30:42.642]  I've had that for years and years.
[01:30:42.662 --> 01:30:49.084]  And I want to thank all the people in other counties for always supporting me.
[01:30:49.764 --> 01:31:00.069]  Not that they could vote for me and so on, but I've been campaigning, not campaigning, giving speeches constantly, not only there, but recently across the nation.
[01:31:00.129 --> 01:31:03.110]  And I've been doing that, helping the Republican Party.
[01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:13.897]  When Donald Trump ran, I remember way back in June of 15, he announced he came here for his first rally in July 2015.
[01:31:16.239 --> 01:31:17.380]  I introduced him.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.342]  He couldn't get any politics to get on stage.
[01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:21.662]  But I did.
[01:31:21.682 --> 01:31:23.544]  I never met him prior to that.
[01:31:24.504 --> 01:31:25.465]  I liked what I heard.
[01:31:26.306 --> 01:31:28.887]  And I said, he will be the next president.
[01:31:29.408 --> 01:31:29.968]  And he is.
[01:31:30.408 --> 01:31:30.949]  He made it.
[01:31:31.798 --> 01:31:36.060]  And I'll tell you, I don't go against people that I endorse.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:37.700]  I stick with them to the bitter end.
[01:31:38.161 --> 01:31:39.601]  Especially President Trump.
[01:31:40.041 --> 01:31:42.082]  I'm with him to the bitter end.
[01:31:42.202 --> 01:31:43.443]  I don't like to say bitter.
[01:31:43.463 --> 01:31:45.063]  It's going to be a successful event.
[01:31:45.544 --> 01:31:46.564]  But you know what I'm talking about.
[01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:49.345]  Like Churchill said, we're going to defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[01:31:49.585 --> 01:31:51.626]  We're going to go on to the end and we'll never surrender.
[01:31:52.026 --> 01:31:53.267]  I'm going to Washington.
[01:31:53.307 --> 01:31:55.149]  I'm going to straighten a lot of things out.
[01:31:55.649 --> 01:32:00.072]  If they don't put me on any committees, okay, I'll form my own committee.
[01:32:00.693 --> 01:32:02.154]  So, we'll see what happens.
[01:32:02.274 --> 01:32:05.377]  And that's what the president's going to do in six days with his fake news awards.
[01:32:05.877 --> 01:32:07.818]  We're just taking the narrative back.
[01:32:07.878 --> 01:32:09.940]  And, you know, they censor us off everything else.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:10.961]  We just create our own system.
[01:32:11.241 --> 01:32:14.604]  And once again, the President knows what he's doing.
[01:32:14.624 --> 01:32:17.146]  I think that's what really scares everybody.
[01:32:17.206 --> 01:32:18.547]  That's why they keep going after him.
[01:32:18.567 --> 01:32:22.010]  Yeah, they're saying he's an idiot and mentally ill and all this.
[01:32:22.291 --> 01:32:22.991]  Well, that's the case.
[01:32:23.011 --> 01:32:23.772]  We need more of that.
[01:32:23.852 --> 01:32:25.033]  SheriffJoeForAmerica.com
[01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:30.296]  And we hope people go and donate and support, and we'll track as you go.
[01:32:30.316 --> 01:32:37.239]  I got a gut feeling you're going to win if people get behind you, but regardless, you're going to inject real ideas, and you are, I gotta say it, I mean, we gotta admire fighters.
[01:32:37.259 --> 01:32:38.899]  Compare Sheriff Joe to these millennials.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.621]  A lot of them are great folks, but just so entitled, so lazy.
[01:32:42.001 --> 01:32:48.444]  This fellow, for his country, fighting super hard and sharper than, you know, 20-year-olds out there when he's 80-plus years old.
[01:32:48.464 --> 01:32:49.564]  I don't say that as a bad thing.
[01:32:49.624 --> 01:32:50.585]  It's a positive thing.
[01:32:51.045 --> 01:32:55.747]  And we're very, very proud of you, Sheriff Joe, for everything you've done, and then letting them attack you and lie about you.
[01:32:56.107 --> 01:32:57.089]  We really appreciate you.
[01:32:57.249 --> 01:32:57.649]  Thank you.
[01:33:06.984 --> 01:33:09.588]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.349 --> 01:33:34.612]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.913 --> 01:33:37.913]  Welcome back.
[01:33:37.973 --> 01:33:43.935]  If you would like to call in, you may do so in the last segment of the second hour today.
[01:33:43.955 --> 01:33:46.396]  I'll be taking your calls on any subject you like.
[01:33:47.177 --> 01:33:52.859]  Call me to compliment my hair, insult my accent, ask for political guidance, or maybe
[01:33:53.746 --> 01:33:56.087]  You're going on a date, and you want to know what to say to the girl.
[01:33:56.407 --> 01:34:00.829]  Of course, you can call us and talk about any of the substantive and serious issues of the day, too.
[01:34:01.269 --> 01:34:03.130]  And the number, in case you don't know it by now, is 877-789-2539.
[01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:03.330]  That's 877-789-2539.
[01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:08.052]  If you'd like to call in, and in 10 or 15 minutes or so after the next break, we will take your calls to round out the hour on any subject you like.
[01:34:08.072 --> 01:34:10.053]  Next hour, Alex Jones is back in studio in his own show.
[01:34:22.958 --> 01:34:24.359]  I don't know if I'll give him his seat back.
[01:34:24.379 --> 01:34:25.119]  I haven't decided yet.
[01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:26.080]  Maybe he'll be my guest.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:28.761]  Alex Jones live in studio with me next.
[01:34:29.101 --> 01:34:35.905]  Now moving from the free speech crisis to one of the primary causes.
[01:34:37.236 --> 01:34:40.359]  of the clampdown on free speech, and that is identity politics.
[01:34:40.619 --> 01:34:50.869]  Adam Rippon, who appears to have been placed on the Olympian team solely for not only being gay, but also being, well, very gay.
[01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:57.596]  We're not, apparently, in the absence of any talent, but the presence of a flamboyant personality.
[01:34:58.237 --> 01:35:01.259]  He's been feted by the media to discuss
[01:35:02.452 --> 01:35:10.277]  Slipping standards and unusual choices as a result of the cancer of identity politics is another homosexual.
[01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:11.958]  Chadwick Moore joins us.
[01:35:12.118 --> 01:35:15.380]  He is a journalist and media personality.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:20.863]  Probably you will recognize him from Tucker Carlson's show where he's a regular commentator on social issues.
[01:35:22.384 --> 01:35:28.531]  Anytime they want somebody on to make sense of the nonsense about LGBTQ whatever.
[01:35:29.332 --> 01:35:34.539]  Chadwick is a former writer for Out Magazine and editsdangerous.com among other things.
[01:35:35.139 --> 01:35:36.020]  Chadwick, welcome to the show.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:36.361]  How are you?
[01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:38.619]  I'm great, I'm great.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:42.283]  It's warm and sunny here in New York, so go global warming.
[01:35:43.265 --> 01:35:44.666]  Well, the warmer the better.
[01:35:45.207 --> 01:35:46.889]  Adam Rippon.
[01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:55.438]  Now, I said the other day I wanted to create a new TV show called Straight Eye, because Netflix has just brought back Queer Eye, which seems to me is quite outdated now.
[01:35:55.458 --> 01:35:58.722]  You know, I think we all know what gay people think straight guys should do.
[01:35:59.202 --> 01:36:02.083]  But there are a lot of gay people who could do with butching up.
[01:36:02.183 --> 01:36:06.125]  Now you're towards the butcher end of homosexuals.
[01:36:06.825 --> 01:36:08.265]  Adam Rippon, however, is not.
[01:36:08.325 --> 01:36:10.406]  Now he, what is he, came 10th?
[01:36:10.706 --> 01:36:19.890]  Didn't qualify for the American team, but he was sent out to PyeongChang anyway and has been given endless media coverage because of his...
[01:36:21.725 --> 01:36:26.709]  Well, you only have to see him in action to know why the media loves him so much.
[01:36:27.129 --> 01:36:27.969]  What is going on here?
[01:36:28.049 --> 01:36:34.634]  Why is the media giving lavish praise and excessive coverage to somebody who isn't that good an athlete?
[01:36:34.934 --> 01:36:35.534]  What is happening?
[01:36:35.574 --> 01:36:39.057]  Why the Adam Rippon extravaganza on NBC?
[01:36:40.441 --> 01:36:48.369]  Well, you know who's not thrilled about Adam Rippon, and that's Johnny Weir, because he's kind of gunning for his token homosexual news commentator spot.
[01:36:49.771 --> 01:36:55.677]  The media, you know, this is, you have Adam Rippon coming out, he's saying these ridiculous things about the Vice President.
[01:36:56.218 --> 01:36:59.021]  With people like this, I like to play a game called Stupid or Sinister.
[01:36:59.561 --> 01:37:05.646]  So, is it that he's just stupid and he doesn't really understand that culture has moved beyond where he is?
[01:37:05.666 --> 01:37:13.433]  Is he stupid and he doesn't understand that the reason why he's upset about Pence is because of something that had nothing to do with gay people that happened 18 years ago?
[01:37:14.894 --> 01:37:19.678]  Or is he more malevolent when he virtue signals, you know, like a Hillary Clinton or something?
[01:37:20.279 --> 01:37:24.062]  And I think with him, the answer we have is he's maybe neither.
[01:37:24.102 --> 01:37:28.125]  I think he skews towards the stupid, but he is an opportunist.
[01:37:28.205 --> 01:37:34.311]  And just today on CNBC, he was sort of asked about sponsorships and what he wants coming out of the Olympics.
[01:37:34.371 --> 01:37:35.592]  And he basically said, I want money.
[01:37:35.612 --> 01:37:36.492]  I love money.
[01:37:36.813 --> 01:37:37.053]  Well,
[01:37:39.365 --> 01:37:40.727]  We love people who like money.
[01:37:40.747 --> 01:37:54.740]  The problem here is you're basing it on this narrative of gay oppression in America and this narrative of I'm here and I'm queer, get used to it at the Olympics when nobody cares.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.781]  It's about 20 years old.
[01:37:55.841 --> 01:37:56.822]  Nobody cares about us anymore.
[01:37:56.962 --> 01:37:57.623]  Nobody cares.
[01:37:59.404 --> 01:38:02.727]  I've been very, very gay, very publicly.
[01:38:02.847 --> 01:38:09.972]  I've had my face on the side of a bus with the word, and I'm allowed to say this so you're not allowed to get upset, listeners, with faggot on the side of a bus.
[01:38:10.733 --> 01:38:18.839]  You know, in huge letters, getting off at truck stops in Tennessee in a dress and people have said, have looked me up and down and given me a little sort of like,
[01:38:19.676 --> 01:38:20.217]  There, there.
[01:38:20.497 --> 01:38:21.118]  Calm it down.
[01:38:21.458 --> 01:38:28.848]  And then come up to me and said, I don't know about all this lifestyle stuff, but I think what you're doing is brave, so you carry on.
[01:38:29.188 --> 01:38:36.337]  The worst that Americans will do is say they'll pray for you, which you could say was a bit patronising, but that's nothing.
[01:38:37.799 --> 01:38:47.187]  Compared to the bile and vitriol that you received, for instance, from coastal liberals because you started expressing the wrong opinions when you came out as conservative, famously in the New York Post.
[01:38:48.148 --> 01:38:55.814]  It was a far worse experience for you, I would wager, than any gay person has had coming out in America in the last 10 years.
[01:38:58.014 --> 01:39:04.657]  What mystifies me about this is... I mean, if he wants to make money, then he should really just be a better skater, shouldn't he?
[01:39:04.677 --> 01:39:06.698]  Because he's not a particularly good one.
[01:39:06.738 --> 01:39:14.001]  He's got the faggy flounces off, but he doesn't seem to be able to get the high marks necessary.
[01:39:14.742 --> 01:39:15.763]  To reach the top of his game.
[01:39:16.123 --> 01:39:17.385]  We've seen this before, haven't we?
[01:39:17.425 --> 01:39:27.758]  With people who don't succeed at the highest levels in their chosen sport or profession and who see social activism and identity politics as a route to easy fame and riches.
[01:39:28.038 --> 01:39:28.679]  It's a pattern, isn't it?
[01:39:30.566 --> 01:39:31.966]  Yeah, completely.
[01:39:31.986 --> 01:39:35.527]  And I'm sure if we could, in a minute, name 20 people who've done this.
[01:39:35.787 --> 01:39:37.547]  And this goes for Hollywood, too.
[01:39:37.587 --> 01:39:39.808]  Look at all the actors who are so subpar.
[01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:48.290]  I'm thinking of one of them that you maybe got into a little scuffle with on Twitter, who then goes into the social justice angle because they have nothing else.
[01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:56.131]  And then, you know, if it works, then they get movies, they get roles, simply because they have the right politics and they're good at expressing those politics.
[01:39:56.811 --> 01:39:58.052]  Oh, look at his punchable little face.
[01:39:59.752 --> 01:40:00.773]  Do you know what?
[01:40:00.813 --> 01:40:01.594]  Do you know what?
[01:40:01.854 --> 01:40:11.420]  This guy with those over... I mean, just the over groomed, trimmed, waxed, tweezed, plucked, campy, fagginess of it all.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.681]  He makes me want to gay bash.
[01:40:14.602 --> 01:40:16.363]  Like, I'm looking... I'm sorry!
[01:40:16.383 --> 01:40:18.924]  I'm looking at Adam Rippon.
[01:40:18.964 --> 01:40:21.985]  It just makes me want to go out and punch gay people.
[01:40:22.325 --> 01:40:24.326]  Because this is what we have on television.
[01:40:24.346 --> 01:40:26.906]  This is what people think that gay people are.
[01:40:26.926 --> 01:40:27.407]  Well, you know what?
[01:40:27.467 --> 01:40:28.427]  Guess what, Liberals?
[01:40:28.827 --> 01:40:29.347]  Newsflash.
[01:40:29.387 --> 01:40:30.908]  Some gay people are really crap.
[01:40:32.749 --> 01:40:39.534]  Some of us are not all these beautiful magical elves that you can use to beat Republicans with.
[01:40:39.554 --> 01:40:56.226]  Some of us are Republicans and many of us do not subscribe to this awful, you know, like you see love and hip-hop and there's like, you know, these like sassy black women who always have like a wax-tweezed-and-plucked Hispanic gay friend who's just sitting in the wings and kind of loving the drama.
[01:40:57.547 --> 01:41:03.210]  It just makes me want to kill myself and tear my hair out.
[01:41:03.771 --> 01:41:15.458]  That's why they hate gay conservatives so much, because they bank so much of their livelihood on this narrative that, you know, they're oppressed and they're, you know, whatever they have to like, loud and proud, and they've got this huge enemy on the right that's trying to take their freedoms away.
[01:41:15.718 --> 01:41:19.200]  Meanwhile, there's people like you and me and countless others who are like, no, we're
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.061]  We're conservative.
[01:41:20.421 --> 01:41:21.582]  We don't have any kind of a problem.
[01:41:21.882 --> 01:41:22.903]  What else you got?
[01:41:22.923 --> 01:41:29.710]  You know, here on the right, we're fighting actual battles that are far more important than the gay rights movement ever was.
[01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:40.241]  And that's what, as you were mentioning earlier, the battles for the Constitution, for free speech and the First Amendment, far more important than anything the gay rights movement ever stood for, when you consider the consequences down the road.
[01:41:40.501 --> 01:41:53.591]  Right, I mean, at their best, they made a half-hearted effort, you know, for AIDS and whatever, but it was only when AIDS was taken over by the mainstream, by straight people, that anything good actually happened.
[01:41:53.891 --> 01:42:06.481]  It was only when straight people started caring that it became an effective protest movement, and since then, being wrapped up in transgender pronouns, instead of the threat of, I don't know, Islam, you know, running out to...
[01:42:08.602 --> 01:42:12.144]  Transgender, all this transgender mania and Islam is driving so many gays.
[01:42:12.164 --> 01:42:13.665]  What do you think about Big Trans?
[01:42:14.265 --> 01:42:14.905]  Big Trans.
[01:42:15.065 --> 01:42:21.629]  Huge, so there's a new report out that says $400 million has been spent so far on transgender activism.
[01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:26.191]  And this is primarily led by big donors and lobbies and corporations.
[01:42:26.512 --> 01:42:27.852]  We've got to go in 30 seconds.
[01:42:28.112 --> 01:42:31.034]  Give us your opinion on Big Trans, the corporatization of the transgender lobby.
[01:42:31.926 --> 01:42:33.627]  It has nothing to do with men in dresses.
[01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:38.669]  It has everything to do with breaking down the family, breaking down what it... Constructivism.
[01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:43.972]  Propagating constructivism and that... Deconstructivism, I'm sorry.
[01:42:44.492 --> 01:42:47.453]  And that, you know, the family's not real, gender's not real, nothing's real.
[01:42:47.513 --> 01:42:49.254]  We can reinvent society however we want to.
[01:42:49.761 --> 01:42:51.282]  Thank you very much Shadwick Moore.
[01:42:51.422 --> 01:42:52.503]  I'm sorry we don't have more time.
[01:42:52.543 --> 01:42:53.343]  Great to speak to you.
[01:42:53.403 --> 01:42:54.804]  Thank you for your assistance.
[01:42:54.844 --> 01:42:55.404]  See you listeners.
[01:42:55.424 --> 01:42:58.046]  There are some good gay people after all.
[01:42:58.066 --> 01:42:58.566]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:58.586 --> 01:42:59.466]  877-789-2539 if you want to call the next segment.
[01:43:06.226 --> 01:43:07.607]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[01:43:07.647 --> 01:43:09.108]  Victor, you're calling.
[01:43:09.168 --> 01:43:09.509]  Go ahead.
[01:43:09.629 --> 01:43:09.909]  Yes.
[01:43:10.349 --> 01:43:11.070]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:17.375]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[01:43:17.575 --> 01:43:21.558]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[01:43:21.799 --> 01:43:23.260]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:30.326]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[01:43:30.406 --> 01:43:33.248]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[01:43:34.128 --> 01:43:38.830]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:46.692]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[01:43:46.712 --> 01:43:52.533]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[01:43:52.653 --> 01:43:57.995]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[01:43:58.075 --> 01:44:01.076]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[01:44:03.234 --> 01:44:05.296]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[01:44:05.537 --> 01:44:06.878]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:19.339]  Listen to all these incredible five star reviews from verified buyers.
[01:45:19.659 --> 01:45:22.762]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[01:45:23.022 --> 01:45:32.349]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin, and it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[01:45:32.489 --> 01:45:34.851]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[01:45:35.071 --> 01:45:36.772]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[01:45:36.952 --> 01:45:39.614]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[01:45:39.874 --> 01:45:44.397]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[01:45:44.737 --> 01:45:50.781]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[01:45:51.221 --> 01:45:55.764]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[01:45:56.224 --> 01:45:57.365]  That helps with focus, too.
[01:45:57.805 --> 01:45:58.785]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[01:45:59.306 --> 01:46:03.408]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[01:46:03.828 --> 01:46:07.871]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[01:46:08.151 --> 01:46:09.672]  There's definitely been a change.
[01:46:09.932 --> 01:46:10.592]  For the better.
[01:46:11.033 --> 01:46:14.795]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[01:46:15.195 --> 01:46:16.876]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[01:46:17.296 --> 01:46:18.137]  I hope this lasts.
[01:46:19.017 --> 01:46:21.079]  One-Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[01:46:21.359 --> 01:46:27.484]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[01:46:27.784 --> 01:46:32.708]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[01:46:33.168 --> 01:46:36.491]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[01:46:37.092 --> 01:46:38.693]  Taking one capsule a day in the AM,
[01:46:38.993 --> 01:46:42.135]  And even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[01:46:42.676 --> 01:46:44.477]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[01:46:44.757 --> 01:46:45.277]  Not anymore.
[01:46:45.658 --> 01:46:46.858]  Seem to be sleeping better, too.
[01:46:47.419 --> 01:46:49.240]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.861]  I will definitely buy this again.
[01:46:51.662 --> 01:46:55.004]  Head to infowarrestore.com and experience Alpha Power today.

[01:47:35.763 --> 01:47:36.243]  I'm Milo.
[01:47:36.304 --> 01:47:38.885]  We're live from Austin, Texas.
[01:47:39.706 --> 01:47:43.188]  If you've enjoyed this segment, I am at Dangerous.com.
[01:47:43.208 --> 01:47:43.888]  That's where I live.

[01:47:47.110 --> 01:47:48.391]  It comes to you live.
[01:47:49.052 --> 01:47:49.912]  No, it doesn't come to you live.
[01:47:49.932 --> 01:47:50.753]  It comes to you pre-recorded.
[01:47:50.773 --> 01:47:51.153]  Live-ish!
[01:47:51.753 --> 01:47:53.474]  Monday through Friday, 4 p.m.
[01:47:53.554 --> 01:47:54.655]  Eastern, 3 p.m.
[01:47:55.055 --> 01:47:55.496]  Central.
[01:47:56.776 --> 01:47:59.978]  And meanwhile, we're back here in Austin, Texas.
[01:48:01.059 --> 01:48:01.479]  It's simple.
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:06.484]  The more toxins and diseases find their way into your system, the more important it is that your body's detox systems can keep up.
[01:48:06.624 --> 01:48:12.348]  Liver and kidneys are super important, and milk thistle extract will help with that.
[01:48:12.769 --> 01:48:19.014]  InfoWarsLife IQRIN 30-day liver cleanse is at an introductory price of $19.95, which is 50% off.
[01:48:19.614 --> 01:48:20.055]  Half off!
[01:48:20.875 --> 01:48:21.436]  Which is lovely.
[01:48:21.836 --> 01:48:25.699]  I promised yesterday that I was going to take this home and try it for 30 days, which I will.
[01:48:25.719 --> 01:48:27.180]  So I'll report back to you when I
[01:48:28.703 --> 01:48:29.424]  Next in the studio.
[01:48:30.365 --> 01:48:34.508]  You can grab that on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:48:35.309 --> 01:48:40.414]  Help your liver and kidneys take care of and filter out all of the toxins in your body to keep you clean and healthy.
[01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:44.818]  With an incredibly large amount of outside and dangerous toxins, we need to look after these powerful organs.
[01:48:44.898 --> 01:48:45.678]  And with Icurin
[01:48:46.639 --> 01:49:04.873]  Infowars has finally created a formula that can support your liver in cleaning your body and removing dangerous toxins, thanks to a powerful set of ingredients including milk thistle, inacetylcysteine, this is too scientific for a gay person to read, amla fruit, bupleurum root, licorice root, artichoke leaf, and many more.
[01:49:04.953 --> 01:49:09.736]  Now, moving to the phones, we have three people on the line, we're going to get through those calls as quickly as we can.
[01:49:10.257 --> 01:49:15.080]  First name is Preston, who is calling from, I don't know where he's calling from.
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:15.881]  Preston, are you there?
[01:49:19.059 --> 01:49:19.959]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.220]  Hey buddy, how are you?
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:22.000]  How can we help you?
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:22.420]  Doing great.
[01:49:22.761 --> 01:49:23.241]  Doing great.
[01:49:23.261 --> 01:49:25.081]  I'm calling from Springfield, Missouri.
[01:49:25.201 --> 01:49:26.102]  The Show Me State.
[01:49:26.402 --> 01:49:26.722]  Welcome.
[01:49:26.802 --> 01:49:29.023]  And Milo, I'm a big fan.
[01:49:29.743 --> 01:49:31.124]  Appreciate the work that you do.
[01:49:31.304 --> 01:49:31.604]  Thank you.
[01:49:31.824 --> 01:49:38.947]  And we are all getting sick of the liberal propaganda and you are a great asset to our side of the fight.
[01:49:38.967 --> 01:49:40.148]  Thank you very much.
[01:49:40.168 --> 01:49:40.928]  I just wanted to say that.
[01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:46.592]  Um, you seem to love America quite a bit, especially for a foreign national.
[01:49:46.612 --> 01:49:53.138]  So, a question I've never heard anybody ask you is, do you or have you considered becoming a citizen?
[01:49:53.178 --> 01:49:57.381]  And Paul Joseph Watson, if you're listening, you should put that information out as well.
[01:49:57.422 --> 01:50:00.124]  I think it would be great to have you as an American citizen along with Paul.
[01:50:00.512 --> 01:50:01.332]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:50:01.392 --> 01:50:04.934]  If a media career doesn't work out, I could always serve the country in some other way.
[01:50:05.274 --> 01:50:07.756]  I do think this is the greatest country in the history of human civilization.
[01:50:08.416 --> 01:50:10.537]  I think it is the best nation on earth.
[01:50:10.597 --> 01:50:23.163]  I think it has the best values and that's why I want to see it stay that way, which is why I work as hard as I do to stand up for freedoms that I wasn't even born with and that I am slowly acquiring as a result of being here.
[01:50:23.864 --> 01:50:25.825]  Thank you for the compliment and for the question.
[01:50:26.185 --> 01:50:28.406]  I am married, actually, now, here.
[01:50:29.026 --> 01:50:30.468]  So, maybe it'll happen eventually.
[01:50:30.728 --> 01:50:33.130]  I don't have a tearing hurry.
[01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:37.333]  Although it would be quite nice to... I think it would be nice.
[01:50:37.513 --> 01:50:38.074]  It would feel good.
[01:50:38.354 --> 01:50:38.895]  So, yeah.
[01:50:39.095 --> 01:50:40.156]  I think maybe I will.
[01:50:40.476 --> 01:50:40.796]  We'll see.
[01:50:40.816 --> 01:50:42.458]  I have to work out.
[01:50:42.858 --> 01:50:44.779]  I don't even want to pay tax in three different countries.
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:45.480]  I have to work that out.
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:51.205]  But, you know, aspiring to be an American citizen is something that not just people from terrible countries want to do.
[01:50:51.325 --> 01:50:52.986]  People from all countries want to do it.
[01:50:53.026 --> 01:50:55.909]  You have the best country in the world and everybody wants to come here.
[01:50:56.369 --> 01:51:07.159]  It would be a good idea, though, if you filtered out the people who have something to offer and can create some value and create some jobs from the people who want to bring jihad, terror and horror.
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:10.142]  George is our next caller.
[01:51:10.162 --> 01:51:11.303]  Thank you, Preston, for that call.
[01:51:11.643 --> 01:51:12.904]  George is our next caller.
[01:51:13.064 --> 01:51:13.505]  How are you, sir?
[01:51:14.455 --> 01:51:15.456]  Oh, fine, Milo.
[01:51:15.496 --> 01:51:17.738]  I'm so glad to have an opportunity to speak to you.
[01:51:18.279 --> 01:51:21.062]  I was thinking of a counter strategy.
[01:51:21.402 --> 01:51:29.370]  Well, since these teens wanted to ban all the guns, maybe we should look into how teens drive, like teens between
[01:51:30.351 --> 01:51:42.405]  The last statistics that were shown by the Center of Disease and Control, our governmental statistics organization, in 2015, there was an average of 2,333 young people died because they were drunk and driving.
[01:51:50.494 --> 01:51:50.614]  Mm-hmm
[01:52:08.141 --> 01:52:09.502]  Should not get a license.
[01:52:10.162 --> 01:52:12.823]  Because isn't that more dangerous than a gun?
[01:52:12.843 --> 01:52:17.406]  Since so many people are being mowed down by teens that are drunk.
[01:52:17.786 --> 01:52:18.966]  And then another statistic.
[01:52:19.086 --> 01:52:20.347]  Unlicensed drivers.
[01:52:20.367 --> 01:52:21.648]  This is a very interesting statistic.
[01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:23.228]  This is an average between 2010 and 2014.
[01:52:23.268 --> 01:52:24.929]  6,577 persons die each year from people who are unlicensed.
[01:52:35.547 --> 01:52:38.208]  Half of these were illegal immigrants.
[01:52:38.228 --> 01:52:46.472]  Houston came out with a story just recently where they confiscated any vehicles that couldn't show a valid insurance thing.
[01:52:47.133 --> 01:52:52.515]  And it just happened to be those that when they confiscated this, most of them were illegals, but not all illegals.
[01:52:52.916 --> 01:52:59.319]  But it happened that the motor vehicle accidents went down 40% in the city, so maybe we should
[01:52:59.919 --> 01:53:06.605]  Have a, you know, take away the cars of all these people that are involved in these type of accidents.
[01:53:06.685 --> 01:53:08.126]  And how would teens like that?
[01:53:08.146 --> 01:53:09.647]  Well, it's a good point you're making.
[01:53:09.687 --> 01:53:10.528]  Thank you for the call.
[01:53:11.128 --> 01:53:12.389]  You make two points, really.
[01:53:12.589 --> 01:53:23.778]  One is that if we're about saving lives, if our priority is saving people's lives, then we behave quite differently, wouldn't we, from the gun control lobby who's
[01:53:24.858 --> 01:53:26.179]  Objectives seem to be something different.
[01:53:26.219 --> 01:53:36.062]  Objectives seem to be more related to the breakdowns in freedom, to the overweening control of government and the rights of citizens to protect themselves against government.
[01:53:36.122 --> 01:53:40.103]  Far more focused on that, let's say, than they are focused on preventing deaths.
[01:53:40.404 --> 01:53:44.385]  I think more people die of bee stings than these shootings, don't they?
[01:53:45.105 --> 01:53:49.827]  If you want to save lives, there are much better ways to do it than bearing down.
[01:53:50.507 --> 01:53:53.988]  On one of the founding principles of the nation's freedom.
[01:53:54.368 --> 01:54:11.433]  And the second point you make, which is just as good, you know, it's, um, what you're trying to do is analyze a logical argument because you're taking the left at face value and providing counterfact for an argument they're not really making.
[01:54:12.253 --> 01:54:19.235]  And this is a question of whether or not we want to hand over powers, hand over our freedoms to
[01:54:21.866 --> 01:54:38.163]  In some cases, you know, the apparatus of the state we didn't elect and it just mystifies me as a visitor to this nation, as somebody who appreciates America as an external spectator and as a lover of your way of doing things, how willing so many Americans are to give up
[01:54:39.244 --> 01:54:41.885]  I mean, you guys really don't know how good you have it here sometimes.
[01:54:42.146 --> 01:54:44.367]  Let's do a very, very quick call before we have to wrap up the show.
[01:54:44.387 --> 01:54:48.929]  We've got some final messages and I'm back in the third hour with Alex retaking his hot seat.
[01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:50.090]  I'll be over here.
[01:54:50.130 --> 01:54:54.772]  Alex is going to be breaking some news about the Florida, what do we call it now?
[01:54:55.153 --> 01:54:56.073]  Ongoing catastrophe.
[01:54:56.373 --> 01:54:58.294]  Quickly, let's go to Jonathan on the phones.
[01:54:58.314 --> 01:54:59.555]  We've got one minute to go with Jonathan.
[01:54:59.975 --> 01:55:00.716]  Jonathan, how are you, sir?
[01:55:00.736 --> 01:55:01.236]  How can we help you?
[01:55:02.088 --> 01:55:02.969]  I'm coming along nicely.
[01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:06.771]  Thanks so much, Milo, for hosting the show while Alex has gone.
[01:55:06.811 --> 01:55:07.812]  It's been quite a delight.
[01:55:07.852 --> 01:55:15.557]  I've always enjoyed your style and grace and how you communicate very articulate and very in-the-know on a diverse topic.
[01:55:15.657 --> 01:55:20.440]  And you've been through a lot, and I'm really glad you're out there championing for us.
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:20.740]  Thank you.
[01:55:22.301 --> 01:55:35.052]  With that being said, I feel safe coming out to you in this way, and I look at the trans community, I look at transgender and trans species and trans races and everyone, and as a Canadian, I think I feel like a transnationalist.
[01:55:35.112 --> 01:55:36.353]  I've always identified as American.
[01:55:36.433 --> 01:55:37.194]  I love Donald Trump.
[01:55:37.914 --> 01:55:44.320]  I get persecuted for my beliefs up here, for embracing such a remarkable leader, Commander-in-Chief.
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:47.944]  And I don't think I could marry an American woman in a kind of time slot.
[01:55:47.964 --> 01:55:49.286]  They're changing the rules to get in the country.
[01:55:49.326 --> 01:56:00.398]  But I feel if I'm a transnationalist, I should be able to cross the border with open arms and greeted by my liberal friends and make my way down south to the good-hearted people and settle in Austin.
[01:56:03.283 --> 01:56:09.348]  Maybe there should be some kind of ideological purity test put into the citizenship requirements as well.
[01:56:10.488 --> 01:56:20.196]  Look, there are a small slice of people every generation who truly believe in freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of everything.
[01:56:20.536 --> 01:56:30.484]  And those people, you know, it's incumbent upon us to stand up for our values, to explain what we believe in, and to stick up for it on behalf of everybody else, on behalf of the sleepwalkers.
[01:56:31.404 --> 01:56:44.180]  Because, you know, at any given time in history, most of the people in the West just blindly inherit the freedoms and rights that they have without realizing what was given up, what was sacrificed to accomplish them, to achieve them.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:47.063]  This generation, the millennial generation in particular.
[01:56:48.324 --> 01:56:58.831]  Gruesomely entitled, because they are the first generation to grow up without really experiencing war or terror or horrors of any kind, except of course being misgendered.
[01:56:59.731 --> 01:57:11.559]  So, you know, I think a lot of people who look out on the state of free speech, free expression, capitalism and all the rest of it in the West are looking to America for hope, but America is increasingly not providing that hope for the rest of the world.
[01:57:11.919 --> 01:57:15.541]  Maybe the election of Donald Trump will help to improve the situation.
[01:57:15.641 --> 01:57:16.061]  Who knows?
[01:57:16.121 --> 01:57:16.742]  Thank you very much.
[01:57:17.242 --> 01:57:18.443]  For the call, Jonathan.
[01:57:19.244 --> 01:57:20.805]  Hope you've enjoyed the last two hours.
[01:57:21.065 --> 01:57:23.267]  I have been standing in for Alex Jones.
[01:57:23.447 --> 01:57:28.531]  But it is the Alex Jones Show and the great man is back in the hot seat after this break.
[01:57:28.971 --> 01:57:29.731]  I've been Miley Yiannopoulos.
[01:57:29.751 --> 01:57:30.692]  You can see more from me.
[01:57:31.052 --> 01:57:32.554]  The Milo Show goes out Monday to Friday.
[01:57:32.594 --> 01:57:34.715]  Dangerous.com slash join.
[01:57:35.176 --> 01:57:40.299]  We will be right back with Alex Jones here on the Alex Jones Show for our number three.
[01:57:40.439 --> 01:57:40.940]  See you shortly.
[01:57:53.243 --> 01:58:04.765]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[01:58:04.825 --> 01:58:05.765]  We're exposed to lead.
[01:58:05.805 --> 01:58:06.826]  We're exposed to mercury.
[01:58:06.866 --> 01:58:11.866]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[01:58:12.247 --> 01:58:17.247]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[01:58:17.347 --> 01:58:19.468]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[01:58:20.268 --> 01:58:21.650]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:25.413]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[01:58:25.513 --> 01:58:30.498]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[01:58:30.879 --> 01:58:36.364]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[01:58:36.725 --> 01:58:41.950]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[01:58:42.290 --> 01:58:43.251]  And over and over again.
[01:58:43.311 --> 01:58:50.214]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[01:58:50.434 --> 01:58:52.616]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[01:58:52.636 --> 01:58:54.276]  I mean, this is so massive.
[01:58:54.356 --> 01:59:07.684]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland in men.
[01:59:07.704 --> 01:59:08.324]  Fertility is key.
[01:59:08.864 --> 01:59:25.456]  Fertility, but all your glands are what really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract actually, the whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[01:59:25.856 --> 01:59:29.859]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[01:59:29.879 --> 01:59:35.223]  When you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying, all of a sudden it was like BOOM!
[01:59:35.803 --> 01:59:39.987]  For losing weight, all this energy, I guess the iodine was sucking garbage out.
[01:59:40.287 --> 01:59:44.771]  It's as important as vitamin C. You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[01:59:44.791 --> 01:59:45.811]  You've got to have water to live.
[01:59:45.992 --> 01:59:49.495]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.

[02:00:06.687 --> 02:00:08.828]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:09.328 --> 02:00:14.591]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:17.492 --> 02:00:19.473]  It says 102.50 on the screen.
[02:00:19.693 --> 02:00:20.994]  You want to fix that to 1 if it's 1?
[02:00:21.054 --> 02:00:21.574]  Okay.
[02:00:22.294 --> 02:00:22.654]  All set.
[02:00:24.375 --> 02:00:25.356]  Welcome back.
[02:00:26.116 --> 02:00:29.898]  We're here in the crazy town, hot seat zone.
[02:00:30.896 --> 02:00:32.676]  This is Miley Yiannopoulos standing in for Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.756 --> 02:00:39.578]  Now, much controversy everywhere in the media about the question of these kids.
[02:00:40.658 --> 02:00:41.258]  What did they know?
[02:00:41.278 --> 02:00:42.819]  Who have they been coached by?
[02:00:43.159 --> 02:00:43.839]  What's been happening?
[02:00:44.359 --> 02:00:56.302]  Jim Hoff's been in huge trouble, the guy who runs Gateway Pundit, massive trouble for allowing one of his writers to accuse them of being quote-unquote crisis actors, quite a claim.
[02:00:56.402 --> 02:00:57.942]  Well, Alex Jones here
[02:00:58.422 --> 02:01:00.043]  Infowars has been doing the research.
[02:01:00.563 --> 02:01:04.165]  Jim Hoft himself from Gateway Pundit is going to be on talking.
[02:01:04.185 --> 02:01:05.866]  Alex Jones has just walked into the building.
[02:01:05.886 --> 02:01:09.228]  We're about to have him after this break coming up.
[02:01:09.308 --> 02:01:10.709]  He's gone through the evidence.
[02:01:11.290 --> 02:01:15.712]  He's looking at exactly what we know and what we do not know about these guys.
[02:01:16.152 --> 02:01:21.376]  And joining me after the break in just a moment will be Alex Jones getting to the heart
[02:01:22.536 --> 02:01:26.520]  Of what a lot of people have noticed about these child actors is that there's something seems to be off.
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:38.009]  Something seems to be a bit peculiar about the scripted Twitter accounts, the scripted media appearances, and then the occasional kind of jumps off message and all the rest of it.
[02:01:38.089 --> 02:01:40.191]  And that strange video of the same boy in California.
[02:01:40.211 --> 02:01:41.492]  So we're gonna find out exactly what's happening.
[02:01:41.853 --> 02:01:42.733]  Alex is with us right now.
[02:01:43.034 --> 02:01:44.515]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones in the hot seat.
[02:01:49.395 --> 02:01:52.037]  I've had enough of these people.
[02:01:52.717 --> 02:01:55.238]  They're a bunch of Christian murderous scum.
[02:01:55.318 --> 02:01:58.640]  They're on giant death factories keeping babies alive.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:01.062]  They're selling their body parts.
[02:02:01.302 --> 02:02:03.923]  What more do you need to know about these people?
[02:02:04.023 --> 02:02:06.785]  I go out and face these scum.
[02:02:07.145 --> 02:02:10.407]  They literally crawl out from under us.
[02:02:10.827 --> 02:02:12.428]  They have green looking skin.
[02:02:12.708 --> 02:02:15.289]  And they run around screaming we love Satan.
[02:02:15.329 --> 02:02:17.651]  We want to eat babies.
[02:02:19.614 --> 02:02:21.415]  I kill my kids!
[02:02:21.475 --> 02:02:23.857]  We came, we saw, we died.
[02:02:48.912 --> 02:03:01.873]  There's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[02:03:01.893 --> 02:03:02.935]  He says me and Hillary
[02:03:03.971 --> 02:03:05.492]  You said we smell like sulfur.
[02:03:05.512 --> 02:03:06.533]  Ain't that something?
[02:03:06.553 --> 02:03:10.515]  I have never seen or smelled any woman like that.
[02:03:10.735 --> 02:03:11.156]  Ever.
[02:03:11.216 --> 02:03:12.296]  People are telling me she smells.
[02:03:12.336 --> 02:03:14.498]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that bad?
[02:03:31.437 --> 02:03:33.598]  We're such self-centered crap.
[02:03:33.778 --> 02:03:38.221]  We don't even notice and it's self-rising up against us.
[02:03:38.301 --> 02:03:45.124]  Millions of pointed people of the very worst type, man, I'm so pissed.
[02:03:46.545 --> 02:03:52.328]  We're gonna stab your daughter at the mall.
[02:03:52.989 --> 02:03:53.509]  Oh, oh, oh.
[02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:57.371]  We're gonna stab your wife, your son.
[02:04:01.857 --> 02:04:16.225]  We're gonna stab you with a butcher knife And then the police chief is gonna say We love our Somalis We love our Muslims Oh, they're so good Oh, they're so sweet
[02:04:20.282 --> 02:04:25.923]  I was watching Fox News as I worked out this morning, and they had the police chief on making excuses from that town in Minnesota.
[02:04:26.564 --> 02:04:32.425]  And they had the Fox News host, this is the Fair and Balanced channel, going, Donald Trump really stepped in at this time.
[02:04:32.765 --> 02:04:39.887]  He said it was a bombing before it had officially been called a bombing, and Hillary's on him, and she's got some really good points!

[02:06:15.645 --> 02:06:20.349]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:22.230 --> 02:06:22.791]  Welcome back.
[02:06:22.831 --> 02:06:28.335]  We are here in the epicenter of global freedom, Austin, Texas, the InfoWars studio.
[02:06:28.535 --> 02:06:31.557]  I am Marley Anopolis sitting in for your usual host.
[02:06:31.637 --> 02:06:32.137]  Now look.
[02:06:33.106 --> 02:06:37.347]  He's, I've had this, I've had someone calling me all day, texting me all day.
[02:06:37.527 --> 02:06:38.467]  Please can I come on?
[02:06:38.827 --> 02:06:40.448]  Please, I've got breaking news.
[02:06:40.868 --> 02:06:41.948]  He won't leave me alone.
[02:06:41.968 --> 02:06:44.068]  I've finally taken pity on him.
[02:06:44.148 --> 02:06:48.109]  So my new Chief Investigative Reporter is in studio with me today.
[02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:52.710]  I've taken pity on him at last and given him an hour.
[02:06:53.651 --> 02:06:55.511]  Take it away, Chief Investigative Reporter.
[02:06:56.983 --> 02:06:58.824]  Well, Milo, it is good to be here with you.
[02:06:58.844 --> 02:06:59.885]  And of course, he's jovial.
[02:06:59.925 --> 02:07:03.207]  I was seriously already planning a beer today, but not on such a serious information.
[02:07:03.588 --> 02:07:04.408]  Always jovial.
[02:07:04.528 --> 02:07:05.989]  Always very, very funny.
[02:07:06.370 --> 02:07:08.171]  Always a very gay lad over here.
[02:07:08.211 --> 02:07:09.011]  Always in a good mood.
[02:07:10.452 --> 02:07:11.553]  The old meaning of that.
[02:07:11.853 --> 02:07:13.654]  So, yes, thanks for having me here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:13.674 --> 02:07:15.015]  You're welcome.
[02:07:15.376 --> 02:07:20.859]  So, you have been digging deep into the Florida crisis situation.
[02:07:22.634 --> 02:07:29.539]  Most, I think what most people are interested in is the internet ablaze with rumors that there's something off about these kids.
[02:07:29.759 --> 02:07:31.741]  There's something off about the reporting in general.
[02:07:32.081 --> 02:07:50.475]  Now Gateway Pundit, the blog, has got into a lot of trouble for posting a piece by Lucian Wintrich that said that they were quote-unquote crisis actors, which is a big claim to make after a huge tragedy that these children, survivors of a brutal mass shooting that killed 17 people, are being coached
[02:07:51.055 --> 02:07:52.336]  Well, first some background.
[02:08:09.653 --> 02:08:10.073]  We're good to go.
[02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:38.054]  And others were saying, oh, you know, Jones is trying to say nothing happened in Florida like he always does.
[02:08:38.134 --> 02:08:41.977]  Well, as you notice, there's no video, there's no audio of that.
[02:08:42.777 --> 02:08:43.978]  That's not what we've said.
[02:08:43.998 --> 02:08:44.999]  That's not what we've done.
[02:08:45.459 --> 02:08:56.066]  Now, I ended up taking some time off to that I was going to use for launching some of the new satellite uplinks and big TV deals that we've already gotten done that I'll be announcing in the next few weeks.
[02:08:56.686 --> 02:09:00.229]  But instead of doing a workcation on that, I have been on this.
[02:09:01.169 --> 02:09:03.990]  I don't think I rarely do.
[02:09:04.050 --> 02:09:16.653]  I stayed home much the day yesterday and just got in front of my office computer and I spent six hours at least doing deep research so that I can tell the viewers and listeners what we've discovered.
[02:09:16.993 --> 02:09:20.173]  There's so much evidence that it gives me a headache.
[02:09:21.314 --> 02:09:23.714]  And I think you just alluded to the beginning of it.
[02:09:24.514 --> 02:09:27.535]  What we do know is there's a cover-up going on.
[02:09:28.277 --> 02:09:43.677]  They are pulling videos of this young man, David Hogg, whose father is an FBI agent, whose mother is a big Democrat and big anti-gun person, who is an anti-gun activist and has been in a bunch of anti-gun videos and reports already.
[02:09:44.298 --> 02:09:55.432]  They are pulling these videos everywhere and pulling videos off Facebook, Instagram, you name it, from their own sites of him in some type of CNN visit internship VIP thing.
[02:09:56.012 --> 02:10:00.278]  Then they're pulling photos of them in the drama department with the other three students.
[02:10:00.438 --> 02:10:02.500]  So A, there's a cover-up going on.
[02:10:03.301 --> 02:10:03.321]  B,
[02:10:05.256 --> 02:10:11.798]  When you pull back from this, they are demonizing anyone that even asks questions.
[02:10:11.818 --> 02:10:24.302]  Well, when you're a young person and a survivor, and I believe the mass shooting happened, and when you end up being a spokesperson in the adult life, and you're a senior in high school, and you're articulate, you're in a man's world.
[02:10:24.782 --> 02:10:31.003]  So you can't then have the Democratic Party, CNN, MSNBC, go and get four students out of 3,000
[02:10:33.685 --> 02:10:40.149]  3,000 at the school, and it's four students that we're hearing about, and then it just goes on from there.
[02:10:40.169 --> 02:10:59.882]  So I want to be clear, from our deep research, I've got like 16 video clips here, I've interviewed multiple students on air, off air, we've played clips of national news, people shooting iPhone video over national news, where students are multiple shooters, I witnessed two people at the same time shooting, I saw Nicholas
[02:11:01.184 --> 02:11:06.268]  The reported shooter cruise with other people when shots are going off, he didn't have a weapon.
[02:11:06.848 --> 02:11:12.072]  None of that's getting out, even though the news is interviewing lines of people the day it happens.
[02:11:13.193 --> 02:11:18.557]  And I've had guests on that said, oh yeah, almost everybody I talked to said there were two shooters and that there'd been a drill, they were firing blanks.
[02:11:18.657 --> 02:11:24.982]  And then now we even found national news admitting they had a drill with blanks being fired.
[02:11:25.602 --> 02:11:28.365]  Not a month before the Secret Service, but that day.
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:35.445]  So all we're saying is, what in Hades is going on here?
[02:11:35.485 --> 02:11:37.507]  So we're going to walk through this in the hour.
[02:11:37.567 --> 02:11:44.713]  And then Jim Hoff, very respected Gateway pundit, broken hundreds of top stories, thousands of major stories.
[02:11:45.214 --> 02:11:47.356]  I mean, just amazing sources inside the White House.
[02:11:47.376 --> 02:11:48.397]  Drudge links to it all the time.
[02:11:50.208 --> 02:11:54.092]  He simply had one of his writers point out what was already on fire yesterday.
[02:11:54.112 --> 02:11:56.013]  And here's the headline.
[02:11:56.494 --> 02:11:57.375]  School exposed.
[02:11:57.415 --> 02:11:59.216]  School shooting survivor turned activist.
[02:11:59.617 --> 02:12:01.478]  David Hogg's father is FBI.
[02:12:01.738 --> 02:12:03.380]  Well, he is the school shooting survivor.
[02:12:04.181 --> 02:12:05.802]  He has turned activist.
[02:12:06.423 --> 02:12:07.384]  And his father is FBI.
[02:12:09.275 --> 02:12:11.816]  Appears to have been coached on anti-Trump lines.
[02:12:11.876 --> 02:12:17.418]  Now, you've got him, clearly you know when somebody's reading off a teleprompter, or messing up their lines, or can't remember them.
[02:12:18.179 --> 02:12:22.441]  I was at a school function last night, and my oldest daughter couldn't remember some lines and kind of choked.
[02:12:22.461 --> 02:12:23.581]  She never does that, she usually wins.
[02:12:23.901 --> 02:12:25.582]  But it was, you know, she kind of choked a little bit.
[02:12:25.822 --> 02:12:27.142]  You could tell she was choking.
[02:12:27.583 --> 02:12:29.243]  So, you know, maybe it's stress, whatever.
[02:12:29.283 --> 02:12:30.804]  We're not saying it didn't happen.
[02:12:31.904 --> 02:12:35.306]  But, everything that was put in that article we'd already covered,
[02:12:36.579 --> 02:12:37.540]  Simply pointing it out.
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:40.001]  Let's post more of the images of him at CNN.
[02:12:41.262 --> 02:12:44.164]  And again, him with the CBS producers.
[02:12:44.925 --> 02:12:51.509]  With the rest of the school in an anti-gun piece that they did last year.
[02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:54.752]  Yes, you heard me right.
[02:12:54.852 --> 02:12:58.755]  So, these are all drama students.
[02:12:58.775 --> 02:13:00.236]  They're also in the school
[02:13:01.843 --> 02:13:03.023]  They want to be journalists.
[02:13:03.344 --> 02:13:05.344]  They're trying to get internships at CNN.
[02:13:05.884 --> 02:13:08.185]  They're doing CBS interviews that are anti-gun.
[02:13:08.565 --> 02:13:18.587]  Before this happens, and we have a student joining us at the bottom of the hour, who is a real student, gave us his ID, is on the school site.
[02:13:20.067 --> 02:13:30.010]  Snopes came out and said he's an actor, this group funded by Soros that runs internet, that censors you and everybody else, who's the arbiter of truth, no judge, no jury, just Judge Dredd Snopes.
[02:13:31.221 --> 02:13:34.283]  They came out and said, this is fake by InfoWars.
[02:13:34.943 --> 02:13:36.944]  This person isn't real.
[02:13:37.604 --> 02:13:38.424]  We'll put it up on screen.
[02:13:38.965 --> 02:13:43.247]  This young black man, Jalen Martin, he isn't real.
[02:13:43.787 --> 02:13:45.468]  He lives 200 miles away.
[02:13:45.968 --> 02:13:49.010]  So he ended up calling snubs, got on the phone.
[02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:51.231]  They said, oh, we know you're at the school.
[02:13:51.271 --> 02:13:53.031]  We thought someone stole your identity.
[02:13:53.312 --> 02:13:59.715]  So they're saying Jalen Martin, who's on record a senior and survived, and who, by the way, knew the shooter as well,
[02:14:00.755 --> 02:14:02.176]  They're saying he's a fake.
[02:14:02.717 --> 02:14:07.681]  Okay, so they're saying what they say we said when we didn't say it.
[02:14:08.281 --> 02:14:19.490]  We, and I agree with Gateway Pundit, said school shooting survivor turned activist, David Hogg's father's FBI, appears to have been coached on anti-Trump lines.
[02:14:20.191 --> 02:14:21.071]  There's no appeared.
[02:14:21.131 --> 02:14:22.472]  There are 3,000 students.
[02:14:22.512 --> 02:14:23.113]  Take this away.
[02:14:24.927 --> 02:14:25.587]  Four of them!
[02:14:26.308 --> 02:14:27.448]  I can't turn on the radio.
[02:14:27.688 --> 02:14:29.729]  We have every major cable channel on.
[02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:43.273]  It's all you see and then they're laughing and giggling and having fun and hamming the camera and doing narcissist flip outs and are just on cloud five billion right now, in my opinion.
[02:14:43.393 --> 02:14:45.634]  Cloud nine thousand.
[02:14:45.834 --> 02:14:48.055]  In a man and woman's world, in an adult world,
[02:14:48.815 --> 02:14:53.898]  They are on television, in front of God and country, saying, how dare you do this to us!
[02:14:54.199 --> 02:14:54.659]  No more!
[02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:56.500]  Not one more dead young person, Trump!
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:58.221]  You will get rid of the guns!
[02:14:58.401 --> 02:14:59.562]  All gun crime is your fault!
[02:14:59.782 --> 02:15:01.644]  Well, when somebody runs over somebody with a car, it's not their fault.
[02:15:01.664 --> 02:15:02.544]  Somebody stabs somebody.
[02:15:02.744 --> 02:15:03.805]  Somebody sells somebody heroin.
[02:15:03.825 --> 02:15:05.786]  It's not, you know, everybody who ever took an opiate's fault.
[02:15:06.047 --> 02:15:12.611]  But we're supposed to just take this guilt on and let people sit there and lecture us, you know, in a man's world.
[02:15:12.991 --> 02:15:28.139]  And then, oh, your dad's FBI, oh, your mom's a big Hillary supporter and Bernie supporter and Democrat and anti-gun and an activist, and you're in anti-gun videos with national television, and all this, and the school stood down, and people stood down, even though the girlfriend says he was going to kill everybody, we warned everybody.
[02:15:28.339 --> 02:15:38.824]  We've interviewed the man that called the FBI on Cruz, and they wouldn't do anything, but none of you guys standing down with a clearly autistic individual saying and doing all this have anything to blame.
[02:15:38.844 --> 02:15:40.144]  I'm not blaming the students or even the school.
[02:15:40.485 --> 02:15:41.245]  I'm blaming the government.
[02:15:41.545 --> 02:16:00.883]  And then I'm to blame, and then if I go, wait, why is it four of you out of 3,000, and why are you all hooked up with the Democrats, and why are you already in anti-gun programs, and why are you trying to do internships at CNN, and then I ask that, and I'm supposed to be banned forever, and aides to congressmen are being fired for pointing out these kids look like actors from some Saturday morning special.
[02:16:02.364 --> 02:16:03.686]  Here's the InfoWars.
[02:16:04.736 --> 02:16:13.383]  My radio program, our TV broadcast, our films are among some of the biggest viral sensations in the last 20 years.
[02:16:14.084 --> 02:16:20.249]  And we're bringing back nationalism, we're bringing back sovereignty, we're bringing back true populism and rule.
[02:16:20.729 --> 02:16:22.310]  For, of, and by the people.
[02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:36.919]  And that's why Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other mainstream media outlets, the modern robber barons of our age, admit, even in congressional hearings and in undercover videos, that the number one enemy to shut down is InfoWars.
[02:16:37.419 --> 02:16:52.373]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live,
[02:16:53.374 --> 02:17:02.898]  The top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror, he was too busy bashing Trump.
[02:17:03.498 --> 02:17:07.440]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about
[02:17:08.914 --> 02:17:19.222]  This information being weaponized, how quickly can you act and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world?
[02:17:19.922 --> 02:17:23.525]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience.
[02:17:23.825 --> 02:17:30.130]  The system self-corrected, that shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore, it should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[02:17:31.351 --> 02:17:32.151]  But you saw this?
[02:17:32.331 --> 02:17:33.092]  USA Today.
[02:17:33.492 --> 02:17:34.593]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[02:17:34.753 --> 02:17:37.055]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[02:17:37.495 --> 02:17:46.243]  At the very least, we can say that, like, this shelf of videos from news partners is legitimate news because we know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[02:17:47.103 --> 02:17:52.128]  And if at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well...
[02:17:52.848 --> 02:17:54.710]  They were looking for him, like speaking with anyone.
[02:17:55.071 --> 02:18:01.018]  So they shadow ban our videos, they block our articles, they ban us from advertising on Google platforms.
[02:18:01.518 --> 02:18:08.706]  That's why it's so essential that you continue to stand in the face of their censorship, because if they can shut us down, they can shut you down.
[02:18:09.287 --> 02:18:13.071]  But because of their brazenness, it's caused this Trizan effect.
[02:18:13.912 --> 02:18:21.540]  And they're now panicking because their attempts to censor us have only made the message expand and get out in ways it never would have.
[02:18:22.201 --> 02:18:25.865]  So I know a lot of you are smarter than I am and you've got great, inventive ways to take action.
[02:18:26.365 --> 02:18:35.735]  But however you do it, spreading articles, spreading videos, on your own email list, telling friends and family about the censored information in person, however you do it, calling in to C-SPAN.
[02:18:37.145 --> 02:18:43.794]  But getting on other shows online, letting them know that InfoWars is the tip of the spear, and that if we can be censored successfully...
[02:18:44.981 --> 02:18:46.522]  All of you can be censored as well.
[02:18:46.982 --> 02:18:50.604]  So be sure and like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter.
[02:18:50.904 --> 02:18:52.825]  Be sure to send out the videos, the articles.
[02:18:53.846 --> 02:18:56.867]  Be sure to report on anything we've covered that you think is important.
[02:18:57.047 --> 02:19:00.149]  Feel free to re-upload our videos and post them wherever you like.
[02:19:00.269 --> 02:19:01.930]  All of it is copyright free.
[02:19:02.430 --> 02:19:03.931]  Be sure and click the notifications.
[02:19:04.571 --> 02:19:09.714]  Be sure and subscribe to all of our great channels because we're in a real fight
[02:19:10.014 --> 02:19:10.174]  I think?
[02:19:30.203 --> 02:19:32.263]  It's evil, and together we're gonna defeat it.
[02:19:32.644 --> 02:19:45.146]  So folks, you have absolutely been the resistance, you have cut through all their propaganda, and because of that I salute you, and I ask you now, more than ever, to redouble your efforts, because if you're watching this transmission and listening, you are the resistance.
[02:19:56.509 --> 02:19:58.389]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:10.483]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.609 --> 02:20:32.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:35.390 --> 02:20:37.771]  You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.
[02:20:38.031 --> 02:20:40.052]  Never waste a good crisis.
[02:20:43.033 --> 02:20:45.794]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:20:45.894 --> 02:20:49.196]  They never want to let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:20:49.536 --> 02:21:01.240]  I am not saying that there wasn't a mass shooting in Florida, but when Islamists that Obama and Hillary turned loose in the Middle East kill close to a million people, it's not even a news item.
[02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:02.481]  It's called an Arab Spring.
[02:21:03.490 --> 02:21:10.674]  When Christians and Jews and non-radical Muslims get killed and sold into slavery and little girls gang-raped by over 100 men, it doesn't even hit our news.
[02:21:11.054 --> 02:21:14.856]  But when 15 young people die, it's the end of the world and it's all gun owners' fault.
[02:21:15.357 --> 02:21:19.299]  Now remember Rahm Emanuel, Rahm Emanuel, on
[02:21:20.814 --> 02:21:27.363]  The Wall Street Journal television years ago said, you don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:21:27.403 --> 02:21:30.707]  And Hillary, as you just saw, said that as well.
[02:21:31.448 --> 02:21:35.253]  Milo Yiannopoulos, best-selling author, talk show host, is co-hosting with me here today.
[02:21:35.594 --> 02:21:37.857]  But I wanted to just get to the meat and potatoes of what we know.
[02:21:41.138 --> 02:21:42.879]  People want the truth about crisis actors.
[02:21:43.119 --> 02:21:50.084]  We know the Democratic Party has hired crisis actors and run ads for demonstrations and things like that before, and to go out and stir up trouble.
[02:21:50.124 --> 02:21:53.447]  We've gotten the internal contracts where they even wanted them to cause civil unrest.
[02:21:54.688 --> 02:21:56.609]  I'm not saying these are crisis actors.
[02:21:56.989 --> 02:22:07.397]  And the media, when we talk about them being actors, being in journalist school, being fans of CNN, being in anti-gun programs already, is that they're clearly coached, and out of 3,000 students
[02:22:11.379 --> 02:22:13.240]  3,000 students at that high school in Florida.
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:17.363]  Four of them are who you see on 99% of the news.
[02:22:17.763 --> 02:22:20.004]  And I've talked to students, we have one coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:23.347]  Many of the students are very open-minded or pro-gun.
[02:22:23.867 --> 02:22:26.229]  But none of these students, I've talked to some of them, they're coming up.
[02:22:27.029 --> 02:22:29.631]  Are put on the news because CNN or others will say, what's your view?
[02:22:29.672 --> 02:22:30.552]  They'll do a pre-interview.
[02:22:30.893 --> 02:22:33.355]  When they're pro-gun, they're not invited to the town hall.
[02:22:33.775 --> 02:22:35.337]  They're not invited on the program.
[02:22:35.357 --> 02:22:37.599]  So, are we saying the shooting didn't happen?
[02:22:37.859 --> 02:22:40.581]  Are we saying they're all actors and that they're faking that something happened?
[02:22:40.621 --> 02:22:40.802]  No!
[02:22:41.102 --> 02:22:42.903]  The media is saying that.
[02:22:43.684 --> 02:22:52.072]  What we're saying is that, just as Gateway Pundit wrote, school shooting survivor turned activist dad hogs father
[02:22:53.814 --> 02:22:57.436]  The FBI appears to have been coached on anti-Trump lines.
[02:22:57.456 --> 02:22:58.016]  That's all true.
[02:22:58.296 --> 02:23:01.337]  School shooting survivor turned activist.
[02:23:01.458 --> 02:23:06.080]  His dad is in the FBI and he appears to be heavily coached.
[02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:16.985]  And then it's the same four people over and over and over again and now he's gone on national television
[02:23:17.915 --> 02:23:32.116]  To say over and over again with the known CIA operative Anderson Cooper, so the guy's dad's FBI, he's on the CIA guy's show, he's on the fake news, CNN, known for staging things, and he says over and over again, I am not a crisis actor.
[02:23:32.497 --> 02:23:33.799]  I am not a crisis actor.
[02:23:34.179 --> 02:23:35.340]  I am not a crisis actor.
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:35.580]  No.
[02:23:35.861 --> 02:23:37.422]  You're a Democratic Party operative.
[02:23:37.442 --> 02:23:38.963]  Your father and your mother are on record.
[02:23:39.204 --> 02:23:40.145]  You go to CNN.
[02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:42.427]  You're all over other news programs being anti-gun.
[02:23:42.667 --> 02:23:47.451]  You were interviewed by CBS to give your whole anti-gun spiel before all this happened.
[02:23:47.811 --> 02:23:54.658]  And so what we're saying is you're being used as a tool, as a spokesman, as a mouthpiece so people can say, oh, it's a child.
[02:23:54.978 --> 02:23:58.401]  Don't disagree with what he says when he says not one more child can die.
[02:23:58.461 --> 02:23:59.142]  Give me your guns.
[02:23:59.362 --> 02:24:00.283]  Well, you're not a child.
[02:24:00.643 --> 02:24:13.449]  You're a senior in high school who's in journalism school and also in drama, and so are your other friends, and so you're now in this world, and we're going to point out that why out of 3,000 is it only this four?
[02:24:13.709 --> 02:24:15.370]  Here he is saying he's not a child actor.
[02:24:15.951 --> 02:24:17.411]  First of all, that Donald Trump Jr.
[02:24:17.571 --> 02:24:24.455]  is liking tweets espousing a conspiracy theory involving you and your dad, I'm wondering what goes through your mind when you hear that?
[02:24:25.379 --> 02:24:30.624]  I'm just so sorry that these people have lost their faith in America because I know I certainly haven't.
[02:24:31.065 --> 02:24:39.132]  The fact that these people refuse to believe that something like this could happen is something that all of us don't want to believe, but the sad truth is that it is.
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:46.643]  These people saying this is absolutely disturbing, and I'm not an actor in any sense, way, shape, or form.
[02:24:47.243 --> 02:24:50.865]  I am the son of a former FBI agent, and that is true.
[02:24:51.546 --> 02:24:55.368]  But as such, it is also true that I went to, that I go to Stoneman Douglas High School.
[02:24:55.388 --> 02:24:57.189]  When was the last time you ever heard a kid say, as such?
[02:24:57.209 --> 02:24:58.229]  I was a witness.
[02:24:58.249 --> 02:25:03.292]  He keeps looking off when he's reading a... When was the last time you ever heard a kid say, as such?
[02:25:04.033 --> 02:25:05.974]  In that way.
[02:25:06.334 --> 02:25:06.814]  As such.
[02:25:06.994 --> 02:25:08.135]  Well that's the whole thing is...
[02:25:08.735 --> 02:25:10.997]  It's unbelievable to me that these people are even saying this.
[02:25:11.017 --> 02:25:12.377]  And the fact that Donald Trump Jr.
[02:25:12.417 --> 02:25:14.799]  liked that post is disgusting to me.
[02:25:15.419 --> 02:25:22.984]  But it's also false in terms of the sense that these people keep saying that I'm anti-Second Amendment.
[02:25:23.044 --> 02:25:23.425]  I'm not.
[02:25:24.205 --> 02:25:28.148]  I would love, if, I want everyone... That's a classic Bloomberg line.
[02:25:28.368 --> 02:25:29.769]  Everything out of these guys' mouths.
[02:25:29.869 --> 02:25:32.511]  It's a lie before... Hit pause for a minute.
[02:25:33.012 --> 02:25:43.679]  Milo, all I'm saying is, Jim Hoff shouldn't be kicked off speaking engagements, and they shouldn't have members of Congress' aides being fired because they said these kids look like actors and sound like it.
[02:25:43.719 --> 02:25:44.080]  By the way,
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:49.261]  It's all the same four ones and all these anti-gun deals and CBS News reports.
[02:25:49.681 --> 02:25:53.362]  I mean, we've got all this and now day one, they're the only ones all over the news.
[02:25:53.742 --> 02:25:55.062]  I mean, that right there, Milo.
[02:25:55.523 --> 02:25:56.703]  It's just very weird to me.
[02:25:56.723 --> 02:26:03.724]  You've got this town where the biggest news story of the month, maybe it's going to turn into the biggest news story of the year, is happening.
[02:26:04.084 --> 02:26:06.105]  It's swarming with reporters.
[02:26:06.765 --> 02:26:08.947]  Everywhere you look there are reporters.
[02:26:09.127 --> 02:26:12.169]  Everywhere you look there are journalists and news cameras.
[02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:18.694]  And yet the only people allowed to be interviewed are these same couple of kids.
[02:26:18.714 --> 02:26:20.876]  That's not how crises work.
[02:26:21.076 --> 02:26:23.037]  I've been a journalist for like eight, nine years.
[02:26:23.057 --> 02:26:24.518]  This is not how it works on the ground.
[02:26:24.779 --> 02:26:25.979]  You get whoever you can.
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:33.003]  There must have been some kind of organizational decision-making to put these four kids forward.
[02:26:33.484 --> 02:26:54.395]  Someone's made that decision, and they've made that decision in consultation with parents, with the teachers, and... And they hit the ground within... Before the shooting's even over, Hogg is videotaping in closets, like, the aliens are at the door, they're about to kill us, and you can... It's like, oh my God, they're coming... It's like Blair Witch Project, and then they're out there everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.
[02:26:55.017 --> 02:26:56.836]  Yeah, I mean, look... But no one else!
[02:26:58.348 --> 02:27:13.958]  What's really bizarre to me is that these four kids, all of whom have the same opinion, all four kids share the same views, the same ideas about what should happen, all appear, they're all beautifully eloquent, nicely turned out.
[02:27:15.498 --> 02:27:17.099]  Look at this, they've all got glamour shots.
[02:27:17.139 --> 02:27:18.921]  Document cam on this shot, show the HD of it.
[02:27:19.201 --> 02:27:25.905]  They've all got glamour shots, and here they are with CBS News doing an anti-gun shoot.
[02:27:27.113 --> 02:27:28.354]  This is Broward County.
[02:27:28.474 --> 02:27:31.416]  I mean, you know, Broward County is not a particularly lovely bit of Florida.
[02:27:31.436 --> 02:27:36.019]  There are a couple of nice homes there, so it is, you know, on average, you know, slightly whatever.
[02:27:36.039 --> 02:27:43.864]  But Broward County is where XXXTentacion comes from, the rapper who was, you know, who was put in prison for beating up his pregnant girlfriend.
[02:27:43.884 --> 02:27:46.286]  This is not, this is, you know, Pompano Beach and whatever is in Florida.
[02:27:46.506 --> 02:27:49.568]  This is not a beautiful bit of Florida, I'm sorry to say.
[02:27:50.128 --> 02:27:54.131]  And for these perfectly turned out, look, I'm not, I don't,
[02:27:55.208 --> 02:27:59.471]  I'm not in a position, having not done the amount of research that you have done, to make a conclusive assessment.
[02:27:59.511 --> 02:28:06.637]  I don't know for sure, but what I can tell you, every instinct I have, every journalistic instinct I have, is telling me that there is something up.
[02:28:06.777 --> 02:28:14.543]  And by the way, on Facebook, Twitter, everywhere, despite the media force-feeding this, no one I know is buying, including family, that thinks I'm wrong a lot of the time.
[02:28:14.923 --> 02:28:17.505]  Everyone is like, Alex, why aren't you saying it's fake?
[02:28:17.585 --> 02:28:22.989]  Look at these actors, look at these polished kids, they're all saying the same crap, and it's only them out of 3,000 kids
[02:28:24.250 --> 02:28:34.218]  And then, if you even begin to go, his dad's FBI, his mom's a big Democrat, he's going and hanging out at CNN and at the CNN News Center and doing VIP intern visits, and so are the other kids.
[02:28:34.399 --> 02:28:38.502]  They go, oh my God, you say the kids didn't get hurt, nothing happened, Alex?
[02:28:38.522 --> 02:28:39.843]  And we're not saying that.
[02:28:40.143 --> 02:28:41.464]  We're simply asking questions.
[02:28:41.484 --> 02:28:44.006]  We'll be right back with Milo Yiannopoulos and more.
[02:28:44.026 --> 02:28:47.569]  We've got one of the students they don't want you to hear from on the other side of this break.
[02:28:47.910 --> 02:28:51.232]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, and Dangerous.com.
[02:28:51.533 --> 02:28:52.333]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:52.353 --> 02:28:52.794]  Stay with us.
[02:29:02.495 --> 02:29:05.158]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:29:05.198 --> 02:29:05.578]  Go ahead.
[02:29:06.439 --> 02:29:08.341]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:29:08.381 --> 02:29:17.751]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:29:18.545 --> 02:29:25.110]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[02:29:25.330 --> 02:29:27.671]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[02:29:27.711 --> 02:29:27.972]  Thank you.
[02:29:28.652 --> 02:29:31.114]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[02:29:31.134 --> 02:29:34.876]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[02:29:35.457 --> 02:29:38.439]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:29:38.479 --> 02:29:39.459]  They are quality.

[02:29:41.521 --> 02:29:44.262]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:29:44.423 --> 02:29:44.943]  Absolutely.
[02:29:45.484 --> 02:29:58.383]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.

[02:31:03.163 --> 02:31:11.986]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers with the biggest organic producer in the country to come out with Immune Wall.
[02:31:13.226 --> 02:31:15.028]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[02:31:15.068 --> 02:31:22.195]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[02:31:22.596 --> 02:31:28.402]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[02:31:29.082 --> 02:31:50.055]  Our ancestors knew work, so let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[02:31:51.136 --> 02:31:55.279]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[02:31:55.599 --> 02:32:00.862]  Because, I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about a thousand years ago is true.
[02:32:01.262 --> 02:32:02.323]  As above, so below.
[02:32:02.883 --> 02:32:05.705]  What you see happening on the mass scale, is also happening on the...
[02:32:06.585 --> 02:32:07.686]  Most tiny of scales.
[02:32:08.186 --> 02:32:09.287]  And that's what this comes down to.
[02:32:09.687 --> 02:32:11.188]  America is building its wall.
[02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:12.069]  Will it work?
[02:32:12.189 --> 02:32:12.689]  We don't know.
[02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.770]  Is Trump right?
[02:32:14.471 --> 02:32:16.572]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[02:32:17.092 --> 02:32:23.056]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[02:32:23.437 --> 02:32:29.321]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[02:32:30.061 --> 02:32:36.343]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[02:32:37.103 --> 02:32:45.946]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[02:32:52.788 --> 02:32:55.149]  This is a 360 non-zero-sum game win.
[02:32:55.810 --> 02:32:59.032]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:59.392 --> 02:33:03.094]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[02:33:05.896 --> 02:33:08.538]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.693 --> 02:33:31.036]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:31.536 --> 02:33:33.057]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.698 --> 02:33:35.679]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:33:36.019 --> 02:33:40.442]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:33:46.016 --> 02:33:48.758]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:48.998 --> 02:33:58.364]  I'm Ollie Knopolis, standing in for Alex, but also accompanied by Alex, my glamorous and intrepid Chief Investigative Reporter for the hour, Alex Jones.
[02:33:58.865 --> 02:34:07.651]  Welcome to the show, and Alex has been digging into the inconsistencies... I think the best way to describe this is a strange smell.
[02:34:08.251 --> 02:34:09.552]  There is a strange smell.
[02:34:09.612 --> 02:34:10.052]  The stench.
[02:34:10.292 --> 02:34:12.674]  The stench of something weird.
[02:34:12.714 --> 02:34:13.214]  The stank.
[02:34:13.975 --> 02:34:14.615]  The stank?
[02:34:15.236 --> 02:34:15.616]  The taint.
[02:34:17.257 --> 02:34:18.798]  You're like a walking thesaurus.
[02:34:18.938 --> 02:34:19.259]  I love it.
[02:34:20.319 --> 02:34:29.166]  There's something weird about the tweets from the four kids who have been wheeled out to repeat anti-gun talking points in the media.
[02:34:29.186 --> 02:34:31.768]  And Alex has been digging down into what exactly is going on.
[02:34:31.788 --> 02:34:33.009]  I'm going to hand over to him now.
[02:34:33.629 --> 02:34:36.171]  He has a guest on who's going to shed some more light on the situation.
[02:34:36.191 --> 02:34:36.772]  That's right.
[02:34:36.812 --> 02:34:43.077]  We're lining up that young man who's been on before and who goes up with his friends and says, we're pro-gun, we're ready to tell you what we saw.
[02:34:43.797 --> 02:34:45.457]  And they go, oh, no, no, thank you.
[02:34:45.537 --> 02:34:48.458]  You mean CNN didn't find time to express his view?
[02:34:48.598 --> 02:34:53.779]  CNN did not talk to this young man who is on his way home before he calls us.
[02:34:53.839 --> 02:34:55.240]  I thought they were fair and impartial.
[02:34:55.260 --> 02:34:57.940]  I thought they were going to have a range of views in their town.
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:34:58.421]  No, they're not.
[02:34:59.121 --> 02:35:02.722]  So let's just review before we get into the other evidence, these other clips we haven't gotten to before he joins us.
[02:35:03.702 --> 02:35:04.242]  Let's just review.
[02:35:05.638 --> 02:35:16.171]  I get up yesterday and today and the headlines are Trump has created an atmosphere where they're saying no one was shot in Florida and where children are being attacked.
[02:35:16.671 --> 02:35:19.455]  And then you go read what they're attacking, Jim Hoffman, Gateway Pundit.
[02:35:20.609 --> 02:35:22.730]  He's like, well, this kid's mom's a big Democrat.
[02:35:22.750 --> 02:35:24.791]  He gets these VIP visits to all these places.
[02:35:25.151 --> 02:35:26.971]  His mom's involved in all this anti-gun stuff.
[02:35:26.991 --> 02:35:27.652]  So is his dad.
[02:35:27.672 --> 02:35:29.212]  His dad's former FBI.
[02:35:29.972 --> 02:35:39.716]  And why is it only the four kids out of the 3,000 at the school that we keep seeing everywhere, obviously all saying classic anti-gun slogans?
[02:35:40.216 --> 02:35:42.057]  We're not anti-gun, just ban them all.
[02:35:42.137 --> 02:35:44.738]  And do something, not one more of us left can die.
[02:35:44.778 --> 02:35:47.399]  And all of you that don't do what we say, you're causing our death.
[02:35:48.639 --> 02:35:56.475]  I mean, this goes, so again, it's only these four students over and over and over and over and over and over.
[02:35:56.555 --> 02:35:59.280]  So that right there means they're skewing in the media.
[02:36:00.609 --> 02:36:01.610]  What's being said and done.
[02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:03.371]  Then he goes on and says I'm not a crisis actor.
[02:36:03.691 --> 02:36:04.791]  We're not saying you're a crisis actor.
[02:36:05.171 --> 02:36:06.612]  I don't know anyone that is saying it.
[02:36:06.652 --> 02:36:07.893]  Jim Hopkins is not saying it.
[02:36:07.973 --> 02:36:09.054]  Infowars is not saying it.
[02:36:09.394 --> 02:36:10.134]  You're not saying it.
[02:36:10.855 --> 02:36:13.376]  What we're saying is don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:36:13.396 --> 02:36:16.658]  Rahm Emanuel, the clip we played earlier, Hillary Clinton saying the same thing.
[02:36:16.958 --> 02:36:23.441]  They're clearly seizing on this, blaming all gun owners, when the big story is all the early warnings were there.
[02:36:24.062 --> 02:36:26.143]  His girlfriend said he was going to kill everybody they warned people.
[02:36:26.363 --> 02:36:28.444]  We've had guests on that called the FBI and nothing was done.
[02:36:28.764 --> 02:36:35.508]  They totally changed the subject away from that when crazy people are running around and they say it's all our fault, Milo.
[02:36:35.808 --> 02:36:39.050]  That right there is outrageous that we're being blamed for this and it makes me angry.
[02:36:39.471 --> 02:36:46.695]  Well, one of the most effective forms of political weaponizing these tragedies is identifying villains and victims.
[02:36:47.595 --> 02:37:02.373]  And so it was very important for activists to take to the streets, Democrat politicians to take to the streets, celebrities to take to the streets, and immediately identify the villains, not as the shooter, but as the NRA,
[02:37:03.334 --> 02:37:03.594]  Trump.
[02:37:04.214 --> 02:37:05.195]  Anybody who likes guns.
[02:37:05.615 --> 02:37:07.316]  Anybody who may ever have voted Republican.
[02:37:07.336 --> 02:37:11.898]  And now they have huge billboards still up for now six days saying kill NRA reporters.
[02:37:12.198 --> 02:37:12.538]  Right.
[02:37:12.598 --> 02:37:14.239]  Or kill NRA supporters.
[02:37:14.679 --> 02:37:18.941]  And then that's allowed to stay up in this total climate of violence.
[02:37:19.081 --> 02:37:20.601]  And what you've noticed is the transposition.
[02:37:20.621 --> 02:37:24.543]  I mean, the guy who actually did this shooting was a crazy kid.
[02:37:24.683 --> 02:37:26.464]  He was on antidepressant medication.
[02:37:26.784 --> 02:37:27.985]  Wouldn't it have been more logical?
[02:37:28.005 --> 02:37:28.645]  By the way, resist 45.
[02:37:29.185 --> 02:37:30.846]  That is anti for the ones that kill cops.
[02:37:30.866 --> 02:37:31.046]  Sorry.
[02:37:31.486 --> 02:37:35.871]  No, I mean, this guy's on medication, he's crazy, he's got no mom, all the rest of it.
[02:37:36.672 --> 02:37:38.053]  You could have chosen him.
[02:37:38.493 --> 02:37:40.015]  You could have chosen Big Pharma.
[02:37:40.275 --> 02:37:45.721]  You could have chosen, you know, many of the elements that were actually responsible for this tragedy.
[02:37:45.741 --> 02:37:50.626]  You could have chosen, dare I say it, wait for it, yes, the FBI for not acting on information they had.
[02:37:51.286 --> 02:37:54.590]  Nobody's suggesting the FBI has manufactured the deaths of children.
[02:37:54.890 --> 02:38:18.002]  Yeah, we don't even want to go that far, but if you want to start saying who's to blame, he's on psychotropics, he has no parents, foster care, he's telling everyone he's going to kill people, he calls himself the school shooter for two years, the warnings go in and nothing's done, and you've got the liberal democrat school standing down, waiting with a whole bevy of student actors who aren't involved, but are wound up, scripted and prepared with
[02:38:19.175 --> 02:38:21.857]  To go public and put out the anti-gun line.
[02:38:21.957 --> 02:38:23.918]  And there's a subtlety here that it's important to grasp.
[02:38:24.179 --> 02:38:29.583]  Nobody that I know, no reasonable person I know, is saying this was a set-up, it didn't happen, and the kids are actors.
[02:38:29.603 --> 02:38:31.484]  No, school shootings happen, there are evil people.
[02:38:31.664 --> 02:38:32.505]  Nobody's saying that.
[02:38:32.565 --> 02:38:34.406]  But the media says we're saying it.
[02:38:34.426 --> 02:38:34.646]  They do.
[02:38:34.706 --> 02:38:36.508]  They say that many of us are saying it.
[02:38:36.868 --> 02:38:38.749]  But there is a more subtle distinction.
[02:38:38.789 --> 02:38:41.511]  Nobody's saying, you know, this is a set-up by the FBI.
[02:38:41.812 --> 02:38:44.834]  But what people are asking is, if the FBI had all this information,
[02:38:45.214 --> 02:38:55.344]  Is there perhaps a sort of general tendency among the FBI because ultimately it serves their purposes not to aggressively investigate and get these people off the streets?
[02:38:55.944 --> 02:38:56.465]  You just said it.
[02:38:56.485 --> 02:38:57.666]  Let me devastate the whole thing.
[02:38:58.266 --> 02:39:01.109]  CBS reporter Shell Atkinson releases the documents.
[02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:03.872]  The ATF agents are like, why are we doing this?
[02:39:03.892 --> 02:39:04.973]  We're getting thousands killed.
[02:39:05.013 --> 02:39:07.836]  They said, we're going to blame it on the gun owners and take the guns.
[02:39:08.136 --> 02:39:09.877]  We have them confirmed killing.
[02:39:10.598 --> 02:39:21.063]  Thousands and thousands, hundreds confirm, you know it's thousands, hundreds of Mexicans with illegal guns that the government ordered gun shops to allow to be sold, shipped to Mexico, to then track them back and blame the Second Amendment.
[02:39:21.364 --> 02:39:27.727]  So if they would turn a blind eye and say commit crime to actually grease the skids to blame gun owners, would they do that here?
[02:39:29.002 --> 02:39:47.483]  I mean, with what we already know about the political attitudes of FBI agents, those texts about Trump, you know, the extent to which the FBI had been compromised by the Clinton machine and by the Democrats more generally at the highest levels, is it so beyond the realms of possibility that there was a general feeling in the FBI
[02:39:48.724 --> 02:40:05.430]  You know, possibly even stretching to the status of policy, not to aggressively investigate and to remove these dangers from the streets, because let's face it, the fewer guns are in the hands of law-abiding, gun-toting, freedom-loving American citizens, the more power the government has.
[02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:12.173]  And by the way, your equation, because I meant to make that point, Milan, I'm glad you brought that up, because the Fast and Furious, if they've done it before, they'll do it again.
[02:40:12.693 --> 02:40:13.614]  They did it another time.
[02:40:14.074 --> 02:40:16.595]  Sam Bernardino, they killed a bunch of people at the Christmas party.
[02:40:17.415 --> 02:40:23.100]  The FBI agents at grassroots level, they tried to do their job at ground level with the federal marshals.
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:35.910]  They were criminally investigated for civil rights violations, were facing criminal charges because they wanted to spy on the mosque after the husband and wife went to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia for the first time and the imam was preaching violence.
[02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:38.552]  Then two years later, we learned they went back and forth.
[02:40:38.912 --> 02:40:43.296]  The attack happens and it was the FBI that actually leaked that, hey, we tried to stop this.
[02:40:43.816 --> 02:40:45.718]  We were ordered to stand down.
[02:40:45.998 --> 02:40:47.799]  Because they did the equation, the Democrats did.
[02:40:48.599 --> 02:40:49.900]  Let them kill a bunch of people with guns.
[02:40:50.380 --> 02:40:52.641]  We'll just say it's not Islamic, like they did the first week.
[02:40:53.021 --> 02:40:53.981]  We'll just blame guns.
[02:40:54.001 --> 02:40:55.822]  Remember the first four or five days they were blaming guns?
[02:40:56.282 --> 02:40:58.323]  Saying, oh, it's not Islam when it was.
[02:40:58.984 --> 02:41:00.324]  So that didn't work for them.
[02:41:00.384 --> 02:41:01.184]  See, but exactly.
[02:41:01.224 --> 02:41:05.566]  They ordered a stand down of a violent mosque planning terror attacks, reportedly.
[02:41:05.586 --> 02:41:06.607]  People in the mosque planning it.
[02:41:06.947 --> 02:41:09.268]  Because they wanted that event to take place, Milo.
[02:41:09.608 --> 02:41:11.850]  Look at Omar Mateen, the Pulse nightclub shooting.
[02:41:11.890 --> 02:41:13.931]  FBI informant?
[02:41:14.191 --> 02:41:16.032]  Totally protected?
[02:41:16.052 --> 02:41:19.555]  The dad is there in the background at Hillary rallies.
[02:41:19.635 --> 02:41:21.296]  Florida again?
[02:41:21.616 --> 02:41:24.318]  Well known to the authorities.
[02:41:24.338 --> 02:41:30.202]  49 liberals should have been leaping on this to protect their precious victimhood class.
[02:41:30.222 --> 02:41:32.143]  It wasn't just gays, it was Hispanic gays.
[02:41:32.183 --> 02:41:34.365]  It was quite far up the oppression hierarchy.
[02:41:34.705 --> 02:41:38.888]  Hispanic gay people are pretty high up in the left's favored category.
[02:41:39.948 --> 02:41:44.590]  Did they aggressively investigate, you know, the causes of whatever, whatever?
[02:41:44.610 --> 02:41:47.591]  Did they shut down the mosque in Sanford?
[02:41:47.611 --> 02:41:55.253]  There was a mosque in Sanford with this guy who said that there was an imam who had spoken at the mosque in Sanford who said the compassionate thing to do about gays was to kill them all.
[02:41:55.493 --> 02:41:59.095]  And this was the mosque that Omar Mateen was going to.
[02:41:59.115 --> 02:42:00.495]  And then his father agreed with that later.
[02:42:00.615 --> 02:42:03.457]  But no, the problem was gun control and toxic masculinity.
[02:42:03.757 --> 02:42:06.399]  Take Islam out of the equation and just use it to bash men and bash guns.
[02:42:06.419 --> 02:42:06.599]  Wow, wow.
[02:42:06.619 --> 02:42:07.420]  We're going to come right back.
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:11.263]  We've got Jalen Martin, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High.
[02:42:11.303 --> 02:42:13.224]  He's pro-Second Amendment, very open-minded.
[02:42:13.484 --> 02:42:14.805]  And the media doesn't want to talk to him.
[02:42:14.865 --> 02:42:16.266]  I talked to him about an hour and a half ago.
[02:42:16.607 --> 02:42:21.350]  He has got unbelievable revelations about what's happening behind the scenes when we come back.
[02:42:21.610 --> 02:42:22.131]  Just briefly.
[02:42:22.731 --> 02:42:23.972]  We've got to end this special.
[02:42:24.192 --> 02:42:26.193]  We've got to sell a ton of it to be able to fund the operation.
[02:42:26.213 --> 02:42:28.455]  What we do, is it's such great toothpaste.
[02:42:28.475 --> 02:42:31.016]  4 to 5 of colloidal silver and nascent iodine.
[02:42:31.076 --> 02:42:34.618]  Super blue is 50% off, but it has got to end today.
[02:42:34.958 --> 02:42:38.060]  When I come back in tomorrow, there's going to be new specials.
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:41.202]  25% off Rainforest, the liver and kidney cleanser.
[02:42:41.322 --> 02:42:42.923]  Icarin, oh my gosh, 50% off.
[02:42:43.304 --> 02:42:44.524]  Cell 4 is 53% off.
[02:42:44.564 --> 02:42:45.465]  It's all got to end.
[02:42:45.505 --> 02:42:46.545]  I've been so slammed and busy.
[02:42:46.886 --> 02:42:50.328]  I have not gotten rid of these specials, despite the fact it's all about to sell out.
[02:42:50.808 --> 02:42:51.829]  I don't want to just sell out.
[02:42:51.849 --> 02:42:53.529]  I want to go back to the regular price before more comes in.
[02:42:53.849 --> 02:42:55.230]  So we've got a lot of new specials coming up.
[02:42:55.270 --> 02:42:56.211]  Take advantage of those now.

[02:44:10.798 --> 02:44:11.799]  MichaelMalice.com.
[02:44:11.839 --> 02:44:15.462]  He grew up behind the Iron Curtain, so he understands the tyranny of collectivism.
[02:44:15.482 --> 02:44:17.043]  He's at Twitter, at Michael Malice.
[02:44:17.123 --> 02:44:21.686]  He's written Dear Reader, Kim Jong-il, and he's been over there and researched it.
[02:44:21.706 --> 02:44:25.809]  So again, Michael Malice, author of The Dear Reader, about North Korea.
[02:44:26.429 --> 02:44:29.832]  Give us your expert take on where we are right now and the chances for war over there.
[02:44:30.232 --> 02:44:31.774]  I talk about this heavily in my book.
[02:44:31.894 --> 02:44:37.979]  If you look at these countries, Libya is a great example, Iraq, and several others.
[02:44:38.139 --> 02:44:43.484]  When the countries liberalize, Romania was the example Kim Jong Il himself used.
[02:44:43.504 --> 02:44:47.288]  When these countries liberalize, very often the people at the top are shot.
[02:44:47.828 --> 02:44:48.689]  And with good reason.
[02:44:48.749 --> 02:44:50.850]  You look at Gaddafi, he was sodomized to death.
[02:44:51.150 --> 02:44:52.431]  Saddam Hussein was hung.
[02:44:52.791 --> 02:44:55.613]  And Libya had a nascent nuclear program.
[02:44:55.953 --> 02:44:57.174]  They agreed to give it up.
[02:44:57.274 --> 02:44:59.415]  And what happened is, right now you have slavery there.
[02:44:59.856 --> 02:45:04.239]  So North Korea very quickly realized that the best defense is a good offense.
[02:45:04.799 --> 02:45:11.063]  Kim Jong Il said he wants to turn the country into a hedgehog, meaning one with nuclear missile spines pointing in every direction.
[02:45:11.523 --> 02:45:19.509]  And if you think about it, how much easier... I don't think they would have been running their mouths to this point if they didn't have nukes or at least some very, very strong weaponry.
[02:45:19.849 --> 02:45:20.990]  Something would have happened to him.
[02:45:21.090 --> 02:45:24.152]  So they are very conniving in their hold on power.
[02:45:24.452 --> 02:45:27.594]  They're very interested in self-preservation.
[02:45:27.894 --> 02:45:36.000]  And unfortunately, it's at the expense of the, you know, 25 million North Korean population who are the victims in this horrible decades-long atrocity.
[02:45:36.500 --> 02:45:46.167]  Don't they know the calculus has changed and that the whole strategy of patience and then the globalists using North Korea as a strategy of tension, that that is coming to an end?
[02:45:46.327 --> 02:45:48.449]  It is coming to an end and they're scared.
[02:45:48.569 --> 02:45:52.612]  And they're clearly scared and you see that they're reaching out to South Korea, their arch rival.
[02:45:53.052 --> 02:45:53.192]  I think?
[02:46:07.998 --> 02:46:08.158]  Yeah.
[02:46:27.985 --> 02:46:31.547]  Every country is turning their back on the North, and they don't know what to do.
[02:46:31.607 --> 02:46:34.209]  This is kind of uncharted territory for them, thank God.
[02:46:34.269 --> 02:46:41.232]  And I'm not saying this is the end of the North Korean regime, which I pray every day that it is, but if this were the end, this is what the end would look like.
[02:46:41.473 --> 02:46:50.037]  They are a hostage nation of just people who don't even know what planet they're on, and that's why they're the greatest victims, people under communism.
[02:46:50.077 --> 02:46:54.260]  Michael Malice, the book, Dear Reader, available everywhere at Twitter, Michael Malice.
[02:46:54.480 --> 02:46:55.620]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:46:55.660 --> 02:46:56.261]  I appreciate you.
[02:46:56.954 --> 02:46:57.555]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:06.947 --> 02:47:09.570]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:23.849 --> 02:47:24.690]  How about Prozac?
[02:47:24.930 --> 02:47:26.931]  You know the number one... Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[02:47:27.211 --> 02:47:28.231]  Or that whole class of drugs.
[02:47:28.251 --> 02:47:28.952]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:47:29.032 --> 02:47:30.653]  Oh, whoa, gotta cut that off, don't you?
[02:47:30.753 --> 02:47:32.634]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[02:47:32.654 --> 02:47:38.236]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills.
[02:47:38.357 --> 02:47:38.717]  Calm down.
[02:47:38.737 --> 02:47:43.939]  Your answer is give more money to the psychiatrists and psychologists to put more crazy people on drugs that make them kill people, Pierce.
[02:47:43.959 --> 02:47:45.220]  Let's try and have a debate here.
[02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:45.760]  Yeah.
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:46.961]  Answer me this question.
[02:47:46.981 --> 02:47:48.542]  I'm sick of the same old script here, bud.
[02:47:50.171 --> 02:47:51.632]  That was back in 2013.
[02:47:51.692 --> 02:47:53.953]  Milo Yiannopoulos riding shotgun with me here in studio.
[02:47:53.973 --> 02:48:02.779]  We're about to go to one of the survivors, Jalen Martin, of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who the media is not interviewing of the 3,000 students.
[02:48:02.839 --> 02:48:06.381]  It's four people they're talking to who are all anti-gun acolytes.
[02:48:06.901 --> 02:48:08.542]  But here's the big question everybody's asking.
[02:48:10.243 --> 02:48:12.925]  Were there crisis actors used
[02:48:14.031 --> 02:48:26.518]  There, because the Democrats have been caught for anti-fund Democratic events, putting up ads, paying up to $50 an hour for crisis actors, people that are part of government drills, you name it, to come out and be part of demonstrations.
[02:48:27.299 --> 02:48:36.424]  I don't think the evidence points towards that, but the media is using that, even though we're not saying it and others aren't saying it, to distract away from the four students they are focusing on out of 3,000.
[02:48:38.127 --> 02:48:47.660]  Are Democratic Party members, their parents are, they're anti-gunners, and they are, because they're in the drama department, the journalism department, spouting these talking points.
[02:48:47.740 --> 02:48:51.846]  So yes, they're political mouthpieces repeating things.
[02:48:53.027 --> 02:48:57.192]  And so they're operative, so we have a right to simply counter their political speech.
[02:48:57.493 --> 02:48:58.454]  They're in an adult's world.
[02:48:58.474 --> 02:49:00.116]  We're not attacking young people.
[02:49:00.136 --> 02:49:01.538]  We're not saying there wasn't a mass shooting.
[02:49:01.638 --> 02:49:02.118]  None of that.
[02:49:02.979 --> 02:49:06.103]  Milo, we're about to go to jail in Martin, but what is your view on that?
[02:49:06.123 --> 02:49:07.305]  Because that's what the media is trying to do.
[02:49:07.345 --> 02:49:09.728]  Like, Trump and his son said nobody was shot there.
[02:49:10.308 --> 02:49:16.578]  Well, this is a typical example of what happens after one of these shootings.
[02:49:16.638 --> 02:49:22.827]  First of all, the villain is transferred or relocated, so they've relocated it from the guy who actually did it.
[02:49:24.028 --> 02:49:26.849]  To gun owners, Republicans, Trump supporters and whatever.
[02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:37.494]  And now because they question the politicization of it, now you're victimizing children, even though these young adults are obviously scripted in the combine and spouting Democrat talking points.
[02:49:37.634 --> 02:49:43.437]  And look at what happens when it doesn't quite go as they were hoping, and look at the way in which they distract attention.
[02:49:43.497 --> 02:49:50.019]  Jordan Peterson, for instance, is a famous professor who floored a Channel 4 interviewer, Kathy Newman, in the UK.
[02:49:50.059 --> 02:49:51.200]  He destroyed her.
[02:49:51.340 --> 02:49:55.102]  He played the clip, he said, you're attacking me, you disagree with me, you're making me uncomfortable.
[02:49:55.402 --> 02:49:59.365]  How can I say there's only men and women chromosomally if that hurts people's feelings?
[02:49:59.405 --> 02:50:00.465]  Sorry, that's what life's like.
[02:50:00.485 --> 02:50:02.447]  She goes, I can't answer you.
[02:50:02.867 --> 02:50:03.967]  It was devastating.
[02:50:04.168 --> 02:50:06.349]  So what was the story about within 24 hours?
[02:50:06.709 --> 02:50:08.170]  Mean tweets Kathy was getting.
[02:50:08.190 --> 02:50:09.050]  It was misdirection.
[02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.871]  Changing the story.
[02:50:09.891 --> 02:50:11.492]  People are bullying her now.
[02:50:12.012 --> 02:50:16.013]  Changing the story up to prove some other part of leftist orthodoxy.
[02:50:16.053 --> 02:50:33.279]  Well, what's happening with this is very clearly, very obviously, the left media, which is bruised and battered and beaten and so humiliated by Trump's election, is seeking to establish its legitimacy by calling into question ordinary people's opinions, by laughing at people for being conspiracy theorists.
[02:50:33.599 --> 02:50:38.644]  By demeaning and belittling and calling names to anybody who does not support their... Well that's what they said.
[02:50:38.685 --> 02:50:44.611]  They said that by Trump allowing questions of events and saying CNN lies sometimes, he's opened it up to say no one died.
[02:50:44.891 --> 02:50:46.232]  No, you're a bunch of liars.
[02:50:46.272 --> 02:50:47.934]  You're the reason no one believes what you say.
[02:50:48.275 --> 02:50:49.616]  We're probably sure people did die.
[02:50:49.676 --> 02:50:51.377]  We didn't do this to CNN.
[02:50:51.477 --> 02:50:54.959]  CNN did it when CNN purposefully lied to its viewers.
[02:50:55.039 --> 02:51:00.682]  When it brings, when it buses in protesters and there were photos of them like corralling protesters into the shot, you know.
[02:51:01.022 --> 02:51:02.443]  CNN stages things.
[02:51:02.483 --> 02:51:03.283]  They did it to themselves.
[02:51:03.343 --> 02:51:04.184]  We didn't do it to them.
[02:51:04.444 --> 02:51:07.005]  But look how quickly the story has now changed from the gun thing.
[02:51:07.065 --> 02:51:15.169]  Now they've got the march in the organization and they think they've got the narrative locked down and gun owners are on ABC or NBC dismantling their own weapons.
[02:51:15.330 --> 02:51:15.990]  Okay, we've won that.
[02:51:16.010 --> 02:51:17.030]  Now let's go for the jugular.
[02:51:17.050 --> 02:51:17.931]  Let's go for another victory.
[02:51:18.371 --> 02:51:24.820]  Let's give the right a bloody nose and call everybody asking questions conspiracy theories.
[02:51:24.840 --> 02:51:28.224]  But they won't talk to anybody like Jalen Martin, who is a senior there.
[02:51:28.345 --> 02:51:30.688]  Snopes, here's the story, put up on Infowars.com.
[02:51:31.108 --> 02:51:32.810]  Snopes puts out that he's not real.
[02:51:32.850 --> 02:51:34.493]  He calls them and they go, oh we know you're real.
[02:51:34.853 --> 02:51:36.274]  We thought someone stole your identity.
[02:51:36.314 --> 02:51:38.375]  No, they were saying he was hundreds of miles away.
[02:51:38.455 --> 02:51:40.617]  So, Jalen Martin, what is it like for you?
[02:51:40.637 --> 02:51:52.804]  I mean, you're in the school calendar, you're on the school's website, you sent us your ID before we had you on, but Snopes, run by George Soros, he comes out and actually says you are an actor hired by InfoWars.
[02:51:52.845 --> 02:51:55.766]  Document cam shot, please, while we talk to Jalen Martin.
[02:51:56.047 --> 02:51:59.469]  So, Jalen, tell us the latest developments and folks saying that you don't exist.
[02:52:01.175 --> 02:52:05.776]  Yeah, so it was the managing editor of Snoop.com.
[02:52:07.437 --> 02:52:12.018]  Weirdly enough, they're a fact-checking site, but clearly they don't know how to fact-check well.
[02:52:12.718 --> 02:52:19.740]  If they showed me, like, being on school grounds, they'd probably say that this was photoshopped in or something like that.
[02:52:20.220 --> 02:52:24.882]  But no, I emailed her because she gave a tweet out that basically
[02:52:26.517 --> 02:52:30.539]  If I am Jalen Markman, then I'm lying or I just like traveled there.
[02:52:31.819 --> 02:52:37.542]  I traveled really far just to come there for this, which is completely... Yeah, she said you live hundreds of miles away and you're a fraud.
[02:52:37.682 --> 02:52:38.482]  So you called her?
[02:52:38.522 --> 02:52:47.906]  Because I used to live in North Carolina and she saw a bio that I wrote a year ago for a site that I wrote with a few people for.
[02:52:48.678 --> 02:52:51.260]  But I, you know, I was trying to be professional.
[02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:52.021]  I emailed her back.
[02:52:52.041 --> 02:52:55.764]  I was like, okay, I should have changed this, but I don't necessarily fuck you like this.
[02:52:55.844 --> 02:52:59.466]  And she was like, oh yeah, um, I thought that someone took your identity.
[02:52:59.487 --> 02:53:00.487]  No, you did not.
[02:53:00.647 --> 02:53:01.348]  You're lying.
[02:53:01.848 --> 02:53:03.650]  She was lying so hard about that.
[02:53:03.790 --> 02:53:06.532]  She clearly did not think that someone took my identity.
[02:53:07.353 --> 02:53:08.333]  Who jumps to that conclusion?
[02:53:08.353 --> 02:53:14.018]  Well sure, they're the ones saying that, they're the ones saying don't question a victim when they're the ones that did it.
[02:53:15.327 --> 02:53:16.268]  Exactly.
[02:53:16.668 --> 02:53:27.716]  As soon as someone appears on Infant Warriors or has an imposing view to the one viewpoint that they're going to express tonight, which is gun control, I'm supposed to be going to the CNN Town Hall.
[02:53:28.256 --> 02:53:42.626]  So hopefully if they don't, you know, pre-screen questions like Donna Brazile and Hillary Clinton, then maybe I'll get to ask some real questions that I'm not prepared on a note card or that they prepared for me to ask.
[02:53:43.166 --> 02:53:44.953]  Who's disrespecting children more?
[02:53:45.073 --> 02:53:47.220]  Is it the public who see...
[02:53:48.967 --> 02:53:53.651]  A young kid, obviously reading from a pre-prepared script, and call it like they see it.
[02:53:53.691 --> 02:53:54.632]  Versus Jay Lenny.
[02:53:54.672 --> 02:53:56.133]  He doesn't sound like he's on some script.
[02:53:56.153 --> 02:54:09.945]  Versus Snopes.com, who won't allow a student who was there, a minority student by the way, who the left ought to be leaping at to put on television, who has the wrong opinion about this stuff, claiming that he is not who he is.
[02:54:10.145 --> 02:54:11.326]  Who's disrespecting kids?
[02:54:11.426 --> 02:54:17.331]  By the way, we had him send his ID, but we went and looked, it's all in the school, there's pictures of him, he's all over the place there.
[02:54:17.651 --> 02:54:18.331]  Yeah.
[02:54:18.351 --> 02:54:19.852]  They're just saying he's all made up.
[02:54:20.572 --> 02:54:20.993]  Oh, sorry.
[02:54:21.033 --> 02:54:26.255]  I thought somebody was... You could say that about anyone who is ever interviewed by any journalist ever.
[02:54:26.535 --> 02:54:26.996]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:54:27.116 --> 02:54:28.836]  I thought somebody was... Well, here's the bombshell.
[02:54:29.497 --> 02:54:34.579]  Jaylen, because we talked about it two hours ago, just repeat our little five-minute conversation in this segment and the next, please.
[02:54:34.619 --> 02:54:35.900]  And we appreciate your time and your courage.
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:40.224]  Well, um, one thing that I was, like, right before I was about to come on, I was trying to
[02:54:58.453 --> 02:54:59.454]  We're good to go.
[02:55:14.822 --> 02:55:16.182]  Wait, you just named them!
[02:55:16.442 --> 02:55:18.243]  They're the Fantastic Four!
[02:55:19.403 --> 02:55:21.463]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:21.583 --> 02:55:24.844]  Not coincidentally, it's the worst superhero movie of them all.
[02:55:24.944 --> 02:55:26.664]  I'm sorry, I apologize, Jalen.
[02:55:26.704 --> 02:55:28.865]  It's the only crap superhero movie.
[02:55:28.905 --> 02:55:32.686]  Jalen, Jalen, you're pointing out they're in the drama class and they're in the journalist class.
[02:55:32.706 --> 02:55:34.386]  Sorry, Jalen, keep going.
[02:55:34.406 --> 02:55:39.927]  So far, so far I've confirmed that yes, Cameron Cass is a rat.
[02:55:40.367 --> 02:55:44.569]  It's a Douglas drama, so that's one down, three more to go.
[02:55:44.989 --> 02:55:54.692]  But, um, what I'm showing you over the break was basically, um, you know, I was at the vigil, I was taking pictures, this guy came up to me, he's like, oh, he's taking pictures for you, just doing that for pleasure.
[02:55:54.732 --> 02:55:56.093]  I was like, I'm not doing it for pleasure.
[02:55:56.673 --> 02:55:58.874]  Um, but I'm taking pictures for you, just for the info wars.
[02:55:58.894 --> 02:56:00.934]  He's like, oh, and he walked away immediately.
[02:56:01.555 --> 02:56:04.956]  Like, he knew that, okay, this guy's views aren't the same.
[02:56:05.056 --> 02:56:08.017]  It looked like he wanted to talk to me more than that, but no, he didn't.
[02:56:08.769 --> 02:56:09.530]  We're good to go.
[02:56:25.310 --> 02:56:26.270]  I can't remember where he was from.
[02:56:26.771 --> 02:56:35.834]  But anyway, he was talking to me, um, and he tried to bait me into saying that it was so unusual for someone to have a gun that was, like, young.
[02:56:35.874 --> 02:56:39.616]  He was like, um, aren't older people the ones who should have guns?
[02:56:39.716 --> 02:56:40.976]  Don't you think that's pretty unusual?
[02:56:40.996 --> 02:56:48.339]  I said, it's unusual in the sense that it doesn't happen all the time, but it's not unusual in the sense that people can't have guns if they're younger.
[02:56:48.399 --> 02:56:50.420]  It's about protecting yourself.
[02:56:50.460 --> 02:56:51.421]  Sure, Jaylen, do me a favor.
[02:56:51.441 --> 02:56:53.101]  They're asking me, back off your phone just a little bit.
[02:56:53.141 --> 02:56:53.922]  It's a little overdriven.
[02:56:53.942 --> 02:56:54.342]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:56:55.834 --> 02:57:01.159]  Oh yeah, so I just think that it's them trying to push a narrative.
[02:57:01.199 --> 02:57:04.241]  This isn't just within this country, this is all over the world.
[02:57:04.261 --> 02:57:06.783]  They're trying to push the same exact narrative over and over.
[02:57:07.724 --> 02:57:08.505]  Can I ask you a question?
[02:57:08.525 --> 02:57:22.737]  Putting aside the Fantastic Four, which I love, that's the new thing, it just struck me as more likely that kids who had just been through an experience like that
[02:57:23.752 --> 02:57:25.653]  We'd be really enthusiastically pro-gun.
[02:57:25.673 --> 02:57:27.714]  They'd be like, yeah, we want someone with a gun to protect us.
[02:57:28.335 --> 02:57:35.258]  What's your estimation of the... Let's come back, as Jalen's an awesome witness, breaking this down, but he was a little too close to his phone.
[02:57:35.278 --> 02:57:37.380]  We're going to come back, give him the floor for this segment.
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:38.340]  A little bit more if we need to.
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:40.321]  We'll have Hoff on about 15 after or so.
[02:57:40.561 --> 02:57:51.067]  But I wanted to be able to just... I should just shut up like I did earlier today and let him roll all the stuff he witnessed, all the stuff he saw, and then get your take, Milo, because I want to get Milo's great wit on this.
[02:57:51.087 --> 02:57:52.208]  We start the fourth hour right now.
[02:57:52.890 --> 02:58:01.893]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:58:01.993 --> 02:58:10.096]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:58:10.376 --> 02:58:15.077]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:58:15.257 --> 02:58:21.978]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:22.058 --> 02:58:29.120]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:58:29.220 --> 02:58:36.101]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:58:36.241 --> 02:58:38.582]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two,
[02:58:38.882 --> 02:58:40.605]  And I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:58:40.725 --> 02:58:43.990]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:58:44.130 --> 02:58:45.793]  You will be supporting a free press.
[02:58:46.013 --> 02:58:50.260]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:58:50.440 --> 02:58:52.343]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[02:58:53.703 --> 02:58:57.765]  Brett Smith, author of Thump, The First Hundred Days.
[02:58:58.485 --> 02:59:01.967]  Explain to people about Thump and why this is an important book and how it ties into things.
[02:59:02.327 --> 02:59:04.488]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[02:59:04.669 --> 02:59:09.311]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the president.
[02:59:09.871 --> 02:59:14.253]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[02:59:14.293 --> 02:59:20.157]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable, fluffy little bunny?
[02:59:20.417 --> 02:59:22.898]  It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[02:59:22.958 --> 02:59:24.059]  It's actually hilarious.
[02:59:24.119 --> 02:59:25.599]  I was cracking up reading the whole book.
[02:59:25.639 --> 02:59:26.580]  My wife was cracking up.
[02:59:26.800 --> 02:59:27.841]  It's a great book for adults.
[02:59:27.861 --> 02:59:28.922]  It's a great book for children.
[02:59:28.962 --> 02:59:30.303]  We're selling the book.
[02:59:30.584 --> 02:59:36.489]  We've got it bundled as well here with a one-off poster that's a collector's item.
[02:59:36.690 --> 02:59:39.913]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the poster are $29.95.
[02:59:40.193 --> 02:59:41.814]  That helps support us.
[02:59:42.055 --> 02:59:43.056]  So get the book, Thump!
[02:59:43.176 --> 02:59:45.398]  The First Hundred Days and Alex Jones and Thump!
[02:59:45.718 --> 02:59:49.202]  The Art of Infowars for a limited edition at infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:55.279 --> 03:00:01.224]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.933 --> 03:00:17.118]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.617 --> 03:00:36.783]  Alright, I want to hear from Jalen Martin, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student, about the incredible stuff behind the scenes.
[03:00:36.803 --> 03:00:38.144]  We're getting his audio squared up.
[03:00:38.524 --> 03:00:40.446]  He'll be on this in about 15 minutes, if he can still do it.
[03:00:40.846 --> 03:00:54.216]  But Jim Hoft has been massively demonized from Gateway Pundit for a report put out by one of his reporters that simply pointed out that this David Hogg has become this big anti-gun activist in an adult's world.
[03:00:54.296 --> 03:00:57.018]  His dad's an FBI agent, that his mom is a
[03:00:58.712 --> 03:01:07.197]  Anti-Gunner, big Democrat, and you've got this fantastic four that's only getting the attention over and over and over again.
[03:01:07.217 --> 03:01:08.637]  These four students out of 3,000.
[03:01:10.106 --> 03:01:17.749]  And so for me, that's the issue, is they're in drama, they're in the media department, they're trying to intern at CNN.
[03:01:18.269 --> 03:01:19.990]  That's the only way they knew each other, wasn't it?
[03:01:20.410 --> 03:01:20.550]  Yes.
[03:01:20.570 --> 03:01:23.171]  The only way these kids knew each other was in the theater club.
[03:01:23.651 --> 03:01:25.032]  And you're like, yes, that's about right.
[03:01:25.072 --> 03:01:26.532]  But that's completely reasonable to go.
[03:01:26.572 --> 03:01:32.935]  Why are we being force-fed only these kids and not folks like Jalen Martin that we just had on?
[03:01:33.115 --> 03:01:34.055]  It's easy to imagine.
[03:01:34.335 --> 03:01:35.956]  You know, how this all came together.
[03:01:36.036 --> 03:01:38.517]  It's like, well, we got to find some kids who are on message.
[03:01:38.577 --> 03:01:39.418]  Let's see the drama.
[03:01:39.558 --> 03:01:41.679]  I mean, you're trying to stop.
[03:01:41.739 --> 03:01:47.783]  You have to hold yourself back from putting all of these jigsaw pieces together because it's so obvious what happened.
[03:01:48.363 --> 03:01:48.763]  Well, sure.
[03:01:48.843 --> 03:01:50.784]  And then we're saying a mass shooting happened.
[03:01:51.245 --> 03:01:55.147]  They go, oh, look, you know, all these, the president says nothing happened.
[03:01:55.867 --> 03:01:57.068]  Well, Jim Hoff didn't say that.
[03:01:57.148 --> 03:01:57.688]  I didn't say that.
[03:01:57.728 --> 03:01:58.409]  We have Jim Hoff yet.
[03:02:00.094 --> 03:02:00.534]  There he is.
[03:02:00.554 --> 03:02:00.995]  There we are.
[03:02:01.175 --> 03:02:02.076]  I can see him right there.
[03:02:02.837 --> 03:02:03.837]  He's got to go in like 10 minutes.
[03:02:03.857 --> 03:02:05.159]  That's why we're trying to go to him so quick.
[03:02:05.459 --> 03:02:06.880]  Jim, thanks for joining us.
[03:02:07.701 --> 03:02:09.323]  Wow, what do you make of all this?
[03:02:10.764 --> 03:02:11.224]  Hi, guys.
[03:02:11.645 --> 03:02:12.325]  Good to be with you.
[03:02:13.851 --> 03:02:35.362]  You know, it's unbelievable what's happening, and we got a letter yesterday from one of the parents in the area there near Parkland, and he was saying that his son is pro-Trump, and they called him, and they called his son, and his son told him to F off because he didn't want to participate in their antics.
[03:02:35.682 --> 03:02:38.323]  So of course this is all organized, we know that.
[03:02:38.844 --> 03:02:43.186]  And we also heard from the same father that they're not talking to any conservative kids at the school.
[03:02:44.187 --> 03:02:46.410]  We've got a reporter on the ground.
[03:02:47.111 --> 03:02:48.974]  Most of them are basically libertarian.
[03:02:48.994 --> 03:02:51.899]  They're open-minded or they're pro-Gein, but they're all scared.
[03:02:51.919 --> 03:02:53.862]  They've been told don't go on television.
[03:02:55.014 --> 03:02:56.415]  Well there you go.
[03:02:56.476 --> 03:03:06.366]  They have who they want and we were the first ones to break that this kid, the hog individual, was his father's an FBI.
[03:03:06.606 --> 03:03:10.210]  Of course we know that the FBI screwed up completely with this story.
[03:03:10.370 --> 03:03:14.494]  The FBI said they couldn't identify the shooter when they were tipped off by a YouTuber.
[03:03:14.834 --> 03:03:17.277]  And we know that's absolutely a lie because
[03:03:18.578 --> 03:03:21.820]  This shooter used his real name on YouTube.
[03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:23.981]  He used his real name on Instagram.
[03:03:24.262 --> 03:03:28.184]  This Nicholas Cruz, and he spelled it with a K. I could have found it in three minutes.
[03:03:28.224 --> 03:03:29.545]  You could have found it in four minutes.
[03:03:31.166 --> 03:03:31.567]  Or two.
[03:03:31.987 --> 03:03:35.769]  But it was out there, but they didn't want to
[03:03:36.900 --> 03:03:40.022]  They didn't want to find this guy, they didn't look for him, and then we saw what happened.
[03:03:40.282 --> 03:03:42.164]  And now they're blaming guns, it's just nonsense.
[03:03:42.584 --> 03:03:55.713]  Anyway, this hog, his father's with the FBI, and then we see that this video that they've taken down now off of YouTube, you can't find it, where it looks like he's practicing his lines, and we're being demonized.
[03:03:56.313 --> 03:04:01.356]  Oh, that's the big one you just hit, is they're pulling photos, videos at CNN, CBS.
[03:04:01.636 --> 03:04:07.480]  There's an act of expungement, not just of Pig Hoggy, but all these people.
[03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:10.402]  Did you just call him Pig Hoggy?
[03:04:11.802 --> 03:04:15.084]  Not on purpose, I was trying to remember his name.
[03:04:15.144 --> 03:04:16.285]  I mean, serious respect to him.
[03:04:17.266 --> 03:04:18.026]  His name's Hogg.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:22.562]  Why?
[03:04:23.966 --> 03:04:26.071]  It was a pleasing slip of the tongue, that's all.
[03:04:26.793 --> 03:04:27.154]  Piglet!
[03:04:29.113 --> 03:04:31.594]  He's, he's, he's George Soros' piglet.
[03:04:32.174 --> 03:04:33.415]  Like a little dropping.
[03:04:34.355 --> 03:04:35.335]  Poke him and he squeals.
[03:04:35.355 --> 03:04:36.636]  Soros is like waddling along.
[03:04:36.656 --> 03:04:38.016]  Poke him and he squeals.
[03:04:38.036 --> 03:04:38.857]  Gun control!
[03:04:38.937 --> 03:04:39.477]  Gun control!
[03:04:39.497 --> 03:04:52.322]  Alright, we're going to come back in 60 seconds with the head of GP, the mighty Gateway Pundit, who does have a lot of courage to point out the obvious, that a bunch of scripted kids up there in the drama department and media department
[03:04:52.862 --> 03:04:55.026]  Who are just scripted and have been chosen to be the PR people.
[03:04:55.046 --> 03:04:56.489]  We're not saying the shooting didn't happen.
[03:04:56.529 --> 03:04:57.991]  We're not saying they're crisis actors.
[03:04:58.031 --> 03:05:02.338]  We're saying these are the scripted people being forced down our throats here.
[03:05:03.459 --> 03:05:08.202]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[03:05:08.462 --> 03:05:13.986]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[03:05:14.106 --> 03:05:23.152]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.

[03:05:31.238 --> 03:05:32.919]  That's FortifiedSupply.com.

[03:05:59.673 --> 03:06:02.495]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:06:16.471 --> 03:06:21.428]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:25.552 --> 03:06:26.452]  We are back.
[03:06:26.532 --> 03:06:27.773]  This is InfoWars.
[03:06:27.813 --> 03:06:35.414]  I'm here with my intrepid reporter and His Imperial Majesty Jim Hoft of Gateway Pundit.
[03:06:35.774 --> 03:06:39.635]  We're blessed and grateful he can stay with us for another 10 minutes.
[03:06:39.655 --> 03:06:42.336]  Let's see what he can get accomplished in that time.
[03:06:42.476 --> 03:06:45.196]  I, by the way, could have found out that information you were mentioning in 6.72 minutes.
[03:06:48.337 --> 03:06:49.297]  No, seriously though.
[03:06:50.198 --> 03:06:51.458]  Hey, what about this, Jim?
[03:06:51.578 --> 03:06:55.400]  No one I know, people are getting mad at me that I'm not saying it's totally fake.
[03:06:55.460 --> 03:06:58.521]  People go, is this like an after-school special?
[03:06:58.901 --> 03:07:00.401]  I mean, no one is buying it.
[03:07:00.601 --> 03:07:04.523]  And then CNN blames the president or Donald Trump Jr.
[03:07:04.583 --> 03:07:08.364]  when these kids are in drama, they're on TV, their parents are anti-gun.
[03:07:08.844 --> 03:07:11.185]  They're the only ones being force-fed everywhere.
[03:07:11.485 --> 03:07:13.726]  We know a PR rollout when we're seeing it.
[03:07:14.206 --> 03:07:15.851]  I know the whole truth of what happened.
[03:07:15.992 --> 03:07:19.462]  I just know that we are being fed something as phony as a $3 bill.
[03:07:19.503 --> 03:07:20.004]  What do you say?
[03:07:22.742 --> 03:07:30.267]  Before, Alex, we saw this with the 9-11 widows that they propped up and brought out and wanted to push policy with the widows.
[03:07:30.347 --> 03:07:32.909]  And now we're seeing this with the children from this shooting.
[03:07:33.289 --> 03:07:34.070]  And God bless them.
[03:07:34.410 --> 03:07:35.491]  I'm glad that they're OK.
[03:07:36.091 --> 03:07:37.232]  It's a horrible tragedy.
[03:07:37.712 --> 03:07:46.939]  But they're obviously used by, you know, there's already we've linked them to some Soros groups who are behind these marches and these protests that are being planned.
[03:07:47.359 --> 03:07:49.841]  And so we know it's a complete astroturf.
[03:07:50.322 --> 03:07:54.406]  And the fact that we pointed out then it's a tactic of the left.
[03:07:54.826 --> 03:07:58.349]  Then they come at us completely like we hate children or something.
[03:07:58.830 --> 03:08:00.651]  And we're just pointing out the obvious.
[03:08:00.851 --> 03:08:03.534]  And, you know, thank God a lot of Americans agree with us.
[03:08:03.574 --> 03:08:04.435]  They see what's happening.
[03:08:04.975 --> 03:08:10.940]  Well, yeah, you can't use young adults because, you know, they call 25, as they say, is the new 13 under arrest for development.
[03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:15.223]  You can't take high school seniors and shove them out in a political war saying, turn all your guns in.
[03:08:15.263 --> 03:08:17.025]  And most people start breaking their guns.
[03:08:17.045 --> 03:08:17.725]  I agree.
[03:08:17.845 --> 03:08:24.911]  Oh, you know, some of us aren't going to sit there and, like, throw our guns out the window just because, you know, they put these people on air going,
[03:08:25.271 --> 03:08:26.451]  Never one more death!
[03:08:26.471 --> 03:08:29.212]  Well, what about all the Islamists' deaths or all the rest of it?
[03:08:30.513 --> 03:08:31.613]  Where do you see this going?
[03:08:31.713 --> 03:08:37.795]  I see free speech panel at CPAC cancelled by Pamela Geller after Gateway Pundit Jim Hoff banned.
[03:08:38.395 --> 03:08:45.397]  I mean, it's like the hysteria firing congressman's assistants because they said these kids look as phony as a three dollar bill.
[03:08:46.757 --> 03:08:48.858]  They are so scared of us even questioning their narrative.
[03:08:49.778 --> 03:08:50.859]  Right.
[03:08:51.280 --> 03:08:52.562]  It's unbelievable, really.
[03:08:52.822 --> 03:08:57.588]  And so I get to join Milo's group, and it's an exclusive group.
[03:08:57.628 --> 03:08:59.230]  The CPAC Exile Club.
[03:09:00.332 --> 03:09:01.734]  Right.
[03:09:02.034 --> 03:09:03.396]  And you know what?
[03:09:03.796 --> 03:09:05.619]  We have an article about these kids.
[03:09:06.124 --> 03:09:21.427]  That was the last straw, but I have to tell you guys that what I heard before this was that we had planned this panel, and it's very important because you know, Milo certainly knows, that conservatives are being targeted on social media.
[03:09:21.507 --> 03:09:22.227]  We're being banned.
[03:09:22.247 --> 03:09:23.228]  We're being shadow banned.
[03:09:23.248 --> 03:09:23.948]  We're being blocked.
[03:09:23.968 --> 03:09:25.648]  We're being kicked off like Milo.
[03:09:26.168 --> 03:09:27.728]  And we all know this.
[03:09:27.848 --> 03:09:28.629]  It's very important.
[03:09:28.649 --> 03:09:29.729]  They're trying to shut us down.
[03:09:29.749 --> 03:09:31.209]  They're trying to shut down the voices.
[03:09:31.609 --> 03:09:33.170]  So we organized this panel.
[03:09:33.210 --> 03:09:34.910]  Pamela Geller did a lot of work.
[03:09:36.131 --> 03:09:37.612]  I'm just going to break some news here.
[03:09:37.912 --> 03:09:40.493]  Pamela planned this for six months.
[03:09:40.774 --> 03:09:43.495]  She was begging CPAC to do this panel.
[03:09:43.835 --> 03:09:51.120]  They finally gave her the approval on Monday night after the agenda was already written up so that her name couldn't be on this agenda.
[03:09:51.160 --> 03:09:52.041]  That's what I believe.
[03:09:52.981 --> 03:09:54.102]  I absolutely agree with that.
[03:09:54.202 --> 03:09:57.464]  I've seen them in operation myself.
[03:09:58.365 --> 03:10:02.047]  The funders, by the way, are always in the meeting room when you go in to talk to CPAC.
[03:10:02.247 --> 03:10:03.528]  They wanted a meeting with me.
[03:10:03.568 --> 03:10:05.009]  They wanted me to be a headliner of the last panel.
[03:10:05.049 --> 03:10:09.474]  What it is, is corporations wanting to control your speech to get entree into their BS.
[03:10:09.794 --> 03:10:11.756]  This is just one more level of the censorship.
[03:10:11.796 --> 03:10:21.607]  Well, CPAC people sometimes don't realize because it has the false reputation for being a sort of younger, livelier, cooler bit of the conservative movement.
[03:10:21.687 --> 03:10:24.590]  Actually, it's run by, you know... Crip keepers up on top.
[03:10:24.650 --> 03:10:25.811]  Well, it is run by Crypt Keepers.
[03:10:25.851 --> 03:10:32.414]  It's run by the oldest of the oldest of the oldest school, evangelical Republican old guard, you know.
[03:10:33.055 --> 03:10:36.837]  And they just regularly just dip in and nuke things that they don't like the look of.
[03:10:36.917 --> 03:10:41.699]  You know, this is establishment Republicans behaving just as badly to Jim, to Pamela, and previously to me.
[03:10:41.739 --> 03:10:47.983]  Oh, they're our biggest... These scared, established Republicans are like, I don't know, me, CNN said something bad.
[03:10:48.663 --> 03:10:50.264]  Oh, get rid of them.
[03:10:50.344 --> 03:10:52.045]  That's the only thing holding this up.
[03:10:52.325 --> 03:10:54.066]  We get rid of these people, we'll take the country back.
[03:10:54.406 --> 03:10:57.707]  No, I mean, look, Pamela Geller is a hero for Garland, Texas.
[03:10:57.787 --> 03:10:58.407]  Of course she is.
[03:10:58.587 --> 03:11:00.847]  She's a free speech icon.
[03:11:00.987 --> 03:11:02.147]  I published her last book.
[03:11:02.167 --> 03:11:08.909]  We were the first publishers to put the winning cartoon from Garland, which is so mild-mannered, really, in a book.
[03:11:09.509 --> 03:11:11.689]  All the rest of it, I've been hearing her, as you have, Jim.
[03:11:11.789 --> 03:11:14.329]  Telling the truth in a world of universal deceit and revolution.
[03:11:14.369 --> 03:11:14.690]  Exactly.
[03:11:15.270 --> 03:11:21.851]  I've been hearing her tell me, Jim, like she's been telling you, like she's been trying to put this panel together, because CPAC's been pretending she doesn't exist for three years.
[03:11:21.871 --> 03:11:22.151]  CPAC?
[03:11:22.331 --> 03:11:22.651]  Oh, well.
[03:11:24.631 --> 03:11:27.952]  We rung the young boys, come in, we let them play.
[03:11:28.573 --> 03:11:30.953]  But it's a fake news panel.
[03:11:31.033 --> 03:11:32.754]  It's about free speech.
[03:11:32.954 --> 03:11:40.396]  And because Gateway Pundit exercised their First Amendment rights to report something everybody knows is true, they banned it.
[03:11:40.576 --> 03:11:42.516]  Here's the actors, they roll out these four.
[03:11:42.536 --> 03:11:44.517]  Hey, let's bring in Owen Troyer here.
[03:11:44.537 --> 03:11:45.837]  Hey, you want Jim Hoffman?
[03:11:45.857 --> 03:11:47.138]  I go, well, he's trying to get Jim Hoffman.
[03:11:47.158 --> 03:11:47.918]  You know, let's get him on.
[03:11:48.198 --> 03:11:49.879]  So what is your take on this, Owen?
[03:11:49.919 --> 03:11:50.859]  And then other key points here.
[03:11:51.559 --> 03:12:00.761]  Well, now you have, as you mentioned earlier, state representatives are firing their aides for calling the student activists actors, even though it's a fact.
[03:12:01.201 --> 03:12:02.441]  They're in the drama club.
[03:12:02.481 --> 03:12:07.042]  We have them being posted in social media pictures from the drama club.
[03:12:07.362 --> 03:12:09.602]  We have them on the set of CNN desks.
[03:12:09.682 --> 03:12:10.882]  We have them celebrating.
[03:12:11.382 --> 03:12:11.883]  Oh, look at me.
[03:12:11.923 --> 03:12:15.823]  Honestly, it kind of feels like a very narcissistic thing, seeing these people.
[03:12:16.023 --> 03:12:18.504]  What about all the smiling and giggling and laughing?
[03:12:18.524 --> 03:12:19.924]  Like, our friends all got killed!
[03:12:20.524 --> 03:12:21.284]  We're on TV!
[03:12:23.225 --> 03:12:25.346]  And I'm not... I mean, he's like, how dare you attack the victims?
[03:12:25.386 --> 03:12:27.667]  No, I'm like, shouldn't they be acting more solemn?
[03:12:27.948 --> 03:12:30.729]  Well, you know they say poachers make the best gamekeepers?
[03:12:30.789 --> 03:12:31.549]  You know that expression?
[03:12:31.569 --> 03:12:31.729]  Yes.
[03:12:31.749 --> 03:12:36.672]  Well, I can tell you, as a professional narcissist, that that's exactly what's going on with these kids.
[03:12:37.192 --> 03:12:43.655]  I can give you my expert insight into narcissism and tell you that there's, you know, the particular kind of, like, weird
[03:12:44.796 --> 03:12:51.522]  Funless, rictus grin, you know, smugness of it all is exactly what you would expect.
[03:12:51.582 --> 03:12:54.785]  It is very sinister and, you know, it just, everything stinks about it.
[03:12:54.805 --> 03:12:55.285]  It just does.
[03:12:55.785 --> 03:13:00.510]  Well, Jim Holt, we want to get you back for a full hour soon to talk about everything that's happening at Gateway Pundit Land.
[03:13:01.911 --> 03:13:06.955]  We'll have champagne and caviar for you next time.
[03:13:07.375 --> 03:13:08.596]  I'm not just saying this to declare victory.
[03:13:09.176 --> 03:13:12.839]  No one is buying anything anymore that the establishment says.
[03:13:13.220 --> 03:13:21.186]  I think there probably really was a shooting here and it's terrible, but the aliens who landed in Central Park and no one would believe it if the media said it.
[03:13:21.246 --> 03:13:23.608]  Your comment, Owen, you're going to keep going with us the next segment.
[03:13:25.755 --> 03:13:38.726]  Oh yeah, absolutely, and it's a shame that CPAC decided to take marching orders from Chelsea Clinton, who tweeted against us yesterday, and then by that evening we're getting kicked off of CPAC.
[03:13:38.746 --> 03:13:41.469]  So I blame Chelsea Clinton for all of this.
[03:13:41.609 --> 03:13:43.370]  By the way, can we come back with the billy goat clip?
[03:13:43.671 --> 03:13:46.033]  The FBI calls her the billy goat.
[03:13:46.453 --> 03:13:47.434]  Even her own supporters.
[03:13:48.114 --> 03:13:55.218]  You know, Republicans craving the approval of the left is at the heart of almost every problem this country has.
[03:13:55.719 --> 03:13:58.100]  It is craving, because it's... I'm not being mean to old people.
[03:13:58.120 --> 03:13:59.261]  A lot of old folks are great.
[03:13:59.501 --> 03:14:05.744]  But the old people that believe mainstream media, they still go, it was on... I saw it on the Fox.
[03:14:06.445 --> 03:14:08.606]  CNN.
[03:14:08.706 --> 03:14:10.987]  Are you in the media?
[03:14:11.007 --> 03:14:13.268]  That's a nice vision into what you'll be like in 15 years.
[03:14:17.421 --> 03:14:20.464]  Jim, seriously though, where is this all going?
[03:14:20.724 --> 03:14:23.186]  Well, I'm glad it's getting a little press today.
[03:14:23.206 --> 03:14:27.810]  I'm glad, you know, that I have people out there who support me still, like Pamela Geller.
[03:14:28.251 --> 03:14:29.412]  I mean, it's amazing.
[03:14:29.532 --> 03:14:33.135]  They told her that they didn't want me on the panel, and she said, well, then you're canceling the panel.
[03:14:33.495 --> 03:14:34.856]  They said, no, we're not canceling the panel.
[03:14:34.876 --> 03:14:37.198]  She said, yeah, you are, because I'm not going to go on without Jim Hoff.
[03:14:37.639 --> 03:14:43.044]  So I have total respect for Pamela Geller and for people like Pam who are sticking up
[03:14:43.604 --> 03:14:47.669]  For their friends and cohorts and doing the right thing.
[03:14:48.189 --> 03:14:53.375]  Jim Hoff said they were Democrat operatives and were like, look, scripted.
[03:14:53.515 --> 03:14:57.800]  I mean, they're all, you can't, all CNN will get mad at me.
[03:14:58.721 --> 03:15:08.890]  Saturday night, Jim, I'm headlining an event for Mike Cernovich with Stefan Molyneux, so I'm sure if you get in touch with Mike, perhaps we can restage the panel.
[03:15:09.691 --> 03:15:20.821]  You know, when there's UN conferences, if you can't get into the secret special inner circle of the UN, you have these things called side events or whatever, like the unofficial... No, you should call it the CPAC reject event.
[03:15:21.021 --> 03:15:21.802]  CPAC reject?
[03:15:21.822 --> 03:15:23.203]  Or too dangerous for CPAC.
[03:15:24.344 --> 03:15:25.465]  Too dangerous for CPAC.
[03:15:27.275 --> 03:15:28.356]  It's too hot for CPAC.
[03:15:28.416 --> 03:15:36.041]  Yeah, well anyway, let's see if we can't get at least Pamela and a couple of people down for that and we'll see if we can still have the panel.
[03:15:36.081 --> 03:15:39.203]  Hey look, out of 3,000 students, it's only four people everywhere.
[03:15:39.483 --> 03:15:41.244]  Hey look, they're all Democratic Party operative kids.
[03:15:41.264 --> 03:15:42.305]  Hey look, they're all anti-gun.
[03:15:42.625 --> 03:15:45.367]  Hey look, they're all admittedly actors out scripting stuff.
[03:15:46.227 --> 03:15:47.328]  I'll ban that!
[03:15:47.808 --> 03:15:48.809]  I can't say it!
[03:15:50.091 --> 03:15:51.372]  Man!
[03:15:52.173 --> 03:15:53.974]  The CNN will attack me!
[03:15:54.254 --> 03:15:58.417]  Alright, Jim Hoff, look forward to having you back up soon from Gateway Pundit.
[03:15:58.677 --> 03:16:00.158]  They have been such a friend to InfoWars.
[03:16:00.178 --> 03:16:01.139]  They have been so sweet to us.
[03:16:01.459 --> 03:16:02.020]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:02.720 --> 03:16:04.702]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:16:04.782 --> 03:16:05.102]  Go ahead.
[03:16:05.752 --> 03:16:07.634]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[03:16:07.654 --> 03:16:10.658]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:16:11.499 --> 03:16:12.620]  It just gets old, man.
[03:16:12.920 --> 03:16:14.642]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:16:15.343 --> 03:16:17.425]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:16:17.665 --> 03:16:21.670]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:16:21.690 --> 03:16:24.112]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:16:24.973 --> 03:16:27.294]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:16:27.655 --> 03:16:28.735]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:16:29.015 --> 03:16:29.896]  Us being shut down?
[03:16:30.136 --> 03:16:31.196]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:16:31.617 --> 03:16:32.657]  You know what, Alex?
[03:16:32.677 --> 03:16:33.778]  Put him on pause again.
[03:16:33.798 --> 03:16:34.618]  Hey, Frank!
[03:16:34.898 --> 03:16:40.241]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:16:40.541 --> 03:16:44.843]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:16:45.083 --> 03:16:47.945]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:16:48.205 --> 03:16:48.585]  You understand?
[03:16:48.665 --> 03:16:49.946]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:16:50.306 --> 03:16:51.427]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:16:52.427 --> 03:16:57.329]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[03:17:07.312 --> 03:17:08.332]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[03:17:08.572 --> 03:17:12.013]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[03:17:12.233 --> 03:17:13.634]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[03:17:13.674 --> 03:17:14.474]  They're suing me.
[03:17:14.714 --> 03:17:15.935]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[03:17:16.395 --> 03:17:18.095]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[03:17:18.115 --> 03:17:19.576]  We were bringing $5 million in a year.
[03:17:19.596 --> 03:17:20.836]  It cost a lot to run this.
[03:17:20.996 --> 03:17:22.877]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[03:17:23.117 --> 03:17:24.717]  I keep growing more as fast as I can.
[03:17:25.077 --> 03:17:27.858]  And as fast as I cut them off, I'm shooting out tentacles.
[03:17:28.158 --> 03:17:29.699]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[03:17:29.719 --> 03:17:30.299]  Tell him right there.
[03:17:30.339 --> 03:17:30.579]  Frank!
[03:17:30.859 --> 03:17:31.419]  Hey, Frank!
[03:17:31.679 --> 03:17:32.940]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[03:17:33.340 --> 03:17:37.021]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention.
[03:17:37.061 --> 03:17:38.541]  Although, of course, everybody likes a little bit of attention.
[03:17:38.581 --> 03:17:38.921]  It's nice.
[03:17:39.121 --> 03:17:49.444]  But I can't do TV, and I can't do radio, and I can't publish books, and I can't sell anything, and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... Where are the heretics?
[03:17:49.544 --> 03:17:50.164]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:17:50.224 --> 03:17:52.305]  Using every resource at their disposal.
[03:17:52.345 --> 03:17:53.565]  So it's not bragging.
[03:17:53.685 --> 03:17:54.505]  It's a daily reality.
[03:17:54.525 --> 03:17:56.186]  And that's why you've got to support things like Infowars and...
[03:17:56.866 --> 03:17:59.027]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[03:17:59.047 --> 03:17:59.567]  We're doing it now.
[03:17:59.647 --> 03:18:00.767]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:00.807 --> 03:18:01.548]  Go get a t-shirt.
[03:18:01.608 --> 03:18:01.928]  Get a book.
[03:18:02.188 --> 03:18:03.128]  Sign up for auto-ship.
[03:18:03.148 --> 03:18:06.269]  Get an additional 10% off on any of these things.
[03:18:06.289 --> 03:18:09.710]  That makes a lot of them loss of liters, and then that way, each month, it reships to you.

[03:18:14.892 --> 03:18:15.032]  Listen.
[03:18:17.193 --> 03:18:18.315]  Everybody wants somebody to fight?
[03:18:18.856 --> 03:18:19.477]  We're fighting!
[03:18:19.737 --> 03:18:21.079]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[03:18:21.139 --> 03:18:25.406]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass, but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.
[03:18:25.727 --> 03:18:29.232]  If you make examples of us and fund us, we will be victorious and you win.
[03:18:29.252 --> 03:18:30.013]  Do you understand?
[03:18:30.034 --> 03:18:31.215]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:18:33.570 --> 03:18:38.453]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[03:18:39.254 --> 03:18:42.196]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[03:18:42.856 --> 03:18:45.638]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[03:18:46.279 --> 03:18:51.162]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[03:18:51.522 --> 03:18:57.826]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[03:18:58.186 --> 03:19:03.350]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[03:19:04.010 --> 03:19:07.452]  That's why I recommend Emerick's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[03:19:08.013 --> 03:19:15.838]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[03:19:16.418 --> 03:19:20.761]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[03:19:21.081 --> 03:19:22.542]  No petroleum-based ingredients.
[03:19:22.902 --> 03:19:24.584]  You think our information is hardcore?
[03:19:24.624 --> 03:19:26.045]  You think our focus is brutal?
[03:19:26.205 --> 03:19:27.206]  Try our nutraceuticals.
[03:19:27.226 --> 03:19:27.767]  Try our supplements.
[03:19:27.887 --> 03:19:30.530]  We've taken BrainForce and made it BrainForce Plus.
[03:19:41.400 --> 03:19:42.481]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:27.193 --> 03:20:28.033]  Welcome back.
[03:20:28.713 --> 03:20:34.294]  I am our temporary host for the Alex Jones Show with my intrepid chief investigative reporter.
[03:20:34.314 --> 03:20:34.934]  You're doing a great job.
[03:20:34.974 --> 03:20:35.935]  I can't wait till you're hosting.
[03:20:35.955 --> 03:20:38.435]  If you're up to it, you could fill in hosting stuff.
[03:20:38.455 --> 03:20:39.595]  I want you to be hosting every day.
[03:20:39.615 --> 03:20:43.036]  We're going to go basically 20 hours a day live very soon.
[03:20:43.056 --> 03:20:44.836]  We're launching a bunch of TV satellites.
[03:20:44.856 --> 03:20:45.556]  They're actually already up.
[03:20:45.596 --> 03:20:46.196]  I say they're launched.
[03:20:46.216 --> 03:20:47.077]  We're about to announce it.
[03:20:47.417 --> 03:20:48.977]  A lot of TV stations are already picking it up.
[03:20:49.017 --> 03:20:49.897]  Big, big things happening.
[03:20:49.917 --> 03:20:51.877]  Because Beck wanted his own channel.
[03:20:52.377 --> 03:20:52.978]  No one does that.
[03:20:53.018 --> 03:20:55.178]  You want to target UHF, VHF cable.
[03:20:55.638 --> 03:20:58.280]  And we've already got them by the hundreds lined up.
[03:20:58.300 --> 03:21:00.582]  More than 50 stations already picking us up right now.
[03:21:00.622 --> 03:21:01.342]  That's our big secret.
[03:21:01.602 --> 03:21:03.524]  I hate to kind of brag as the enemy comes after us.
[03:21:03.544 --> 03:21:07.006]  I want to be under the radar, but we can't be under the radar now.
[03:21:07.066 --> 03:21:08.988]  So we're kind of uncloaked to fire here.
[03:21:09.588 --> 03:21:10.549]  Well, I don't hate to brag.
[03:21:10.669 --> 03:21:11.289]  I'm fabulous.
[03:21:11.309 --> 03:21:17.294]  And if you'd like to see more of me, you can visit dangerous.com slash join to join the Milo Show out Monday to Friday, 4 p.m.
[03:21:17.354 --> 03:21:18.074]  Eastern, 3 p.m.
[03:21:18.114 --> 03:21:18.455]  Central.
[03:21:18.695 --> 03:21:20.236]  But today, it's all about Alex Jones!
[03:21:21.037 --> 03:21:22.538]  Hey, I'm all about your show.
[03:21:22.558 --> 03:21:30.044]  Listen, I want true diversity of ideas, and when in the diversity we agree everybody has a right to say it, and that's America.
[03:21:30.164 --> 03:21:31.265]  I like that diversity.
[03:21:31.305 --> 03:21:31.885]  That's beautiful.
[03:21:32.506 --> 03:21:44.476]  It's not diversity to say, in major universities, I covered this at the start of the show today, a little tape piece this morning, where Purdue says, do not say man, man is a connotation of bad things.
[03:21:45.096 --> 03:21:47.498]  Did aliens write this to convince us we're bad?
[03:21:47.558 --> 03:21:48.119]  But enough of that.
[03:21:48.579 --> 03:21:52.829]  Because we've got the whole rest of the hour left, and we've got Owen Schroer, who's badass, invited in here.
[03:21:52.849 --> 03:21:53.871]  He's coming up in the War Room.
[03:21:53.931 --> 03:21:54.834]  I hope you'll join him later.
[03:21:54.854 --> 03:21:56.116]  He just refused to sit on me.
[03:21:58.285 --> 03:22:00.867]  I said, we don't have an extra chair in here, so he obviously can't sit on your lap.
[03:22:00.927 --> 03:22:03.409]  And you said, listen, I'll sit on his lap.
[03:22:03.669 --> 03:22:05.270]  It was a very disappointing exchange.
[03:22:05.950 --> 03:22:07.491]  Well, you are bigger than him.
[03:22:07.551 --> 03:22:09.552]  You're not fat like me, but you're a big guy.
[03:22:09.572 --> 03:22:12.274]  You're a little intimidated here.
[03:22:12.294 --> 03:22:12.474]  Maybe.
[03:22:12.494 --> 03:22:14.035]  He's a svelte little thing, isn't he?
[03:22:14.055 --> 03:22:16.377]  It's like a... He's a lying... Let's punch him up.
[03:22:16.597 --> 03:22:17.978]  It's like Betty LePew.
[03:22:18.018 --> 03:22:19.038]  He's running.
[03:22:19.659 --> 03:22:22.881]  He's a lying, svelte, limber little thing.
[03:22:22.961 --> 03:22:24.261]  He's like a soccer player.
[03:22:25.462 --> 03:22:26.803]  He's sinewy.
[03:22:27.203 --> 03:22:32.305]  Milo harasses Owen.
[03:22:32.345 --> 03:22:33.505]  I love it.
[03:22:33.525 --> 03:22:35.326]  I've got some juice on Milo too.
[03:22:35.546 --> 03:22:36.306]  Owen too.
[03:22:36.386 --> 03:22:37.487]  Hashtag Owen too.
[03:22:39.321 --> 03:22:40.342]  Stop harassing Owen.
[03:22:40.722 --> 03:22:41.563]  Hey, let's get serious.
[03:22:41.623 --> 03:22:43.825]  Jalen, you have been through the fire.
[03:22:43.865 --> 03:22:45.066]  You survived the attack.
[03:22:45.546 --> 03:22:46.107]  You're seeing.
[03:22:46.147 --> 03:22:48.109]  What is it like for you to not be on the news?
[03:22:48.149 --> 03:22:49.450]  No one will talk to you or your friends.
[03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:52.392]  Repeat what you told me three hours ago before we went live.
[03:22:52.773 --> 03:22:53.413]  You've got the floor.
[03:22:53.433 --> 03:22:54.134]  I'm going to shut up.
[03:22:54.634 --> 03:22:58.718]  Jalen Martin, you're driving to this CNN town hall event right now.
[03:22:59.058 --> 03:23:03.902]  One of the survivors there at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida from this whole situation.
[03:23:04.403 --> 03:23:05.764]  Please give us your data download, sir.
[03:23:07.751 --> 03:23:18.737]  Yeah, um, I'm not too upset about the fact that I'm not on all the mainstream news media outlets, but because that's not what I'm here for.
[03:23:18.857 --> 03:23:21.098]  I'm just here to give an opposing view.
[03:23:21.198 --> 03:23:21.999]  It's my view.
[03:23:22.839 --> 03:23:26.241]  And a lot of other people around me whose views do not need to be covered.
[03:23:26.781 --> 03:23:29.903]  I'm the only one who's putting myself out there to do this.
[03:23:30.672 --> 03:23:37.694]  A lot of the other students who have the same voice aren't doing that, so I'm just going to be the one who does it for them.
[03:23:38.074 --> 03:23:43.036]  Whenever someone else comes out, then I'll keep talking about it, but I'm not going to go out there and speak out.
[03:23:47.540 --> 03:23:48.641]  Yeah, a lot of them do.
[03:23:48.661 --> 03:23:49.661]  They're scared to go on air.
[03:23:49.701 --> 03:23:59.087]  I'm pretty sure because they see how the media landscape is, where if you do go on air and you have an opposing view, especially something like this, then you're going to be hounded.
[03:23:59.107 --> 03:24:03.950]  And they don't have that social kind of stability to do that.
[03:24:04.470 --> 03:24:07.972]  Let's just say they don't have the courage and moral compass.
[03:24:08.052 --> 03:24:10.954]  I mean, I'm not putting them down, but you've got will.
[03:24:12.671 --> 03:24:18.414]  Yeah, I'm 100% ready to do this because I feel like I waited.
[03:24:18.654 --> 03:24:21.536]  I waited a day just to try to see what was going to pop up in the news.
[03:24:21.976 --> 03:24:24.757]  Which one of these kids was going to, you know, say something.
[03:24:24.797 --> 03:24:27.278]  There was one kid who said something to Brian Williams.
[03:24:27.459 --> 03:24:29.760]  Of course, Brian Williams, I don't know why he's still on air.
[03:24:29.780 --> 03:24:38.444]  He used to be my favorite news anchor, but obviously it makes you question a lot of things when things about him come out.
[03:24:40.959 --> 03:24:49.281]  That whole idea of the media only covering one side of things really just festers in your mind and then you have to face them.
[03:24:50.222 --> 03:25:05.166]  You know, this is the thing about it, they don't want to come to me because they've been in this ecosystem and this echo chamber of just one-sided views for so long they don't know how to make talking points for me so they can't really do anything unless it's all going to be one-sided.
[03:25:06.624 --> 03:25:07.925]  I think they have talking points for sure.
[03:25:07.945 --> 03:25:11.726]  I don't think any of them are actors or anything like that, but I do think they have talking points.
[03:25:11.766 --> 03:25:14.428]  Yeah, some of them are in drama, but I don't necessarily see that as
[03:25:36.232 --> 03:25:40.537]  I don't think that's a bad thing either.
[03:25:40.577 --> 03:25:41.038]  Exactly.
[03:25:41.178 --> 03:25:47.245]  They've got Democrat parents, anti-gun parents, and exactly, we're not saying they're crisis actors, we're saying it looks scripted.
[03:25:48.466 --> 03:25:49.387]  It does look scripted.
[03:25:49.628 --> 03:25:56.055]  It looks like a talking point, as you saw in that interview with David, where he just couldn't get out that one sentence.
[03:25:57.056 --> 03:25:58.977]  You know, since you mentioned that, let's play that clip.
[03:25:58.997 --> 03:25:59.998]  They gave me a bunch of clips.
[03:26:00.418 --> 03:26:01.919]  Can we play the one where he's bumbling?
[03:26:01.979 --> 03:26:08.324]  Is that the one where the David Hogg is bumbling and isn't able to get his act together?
[03:26:08.344 --> 03:26:09.184]  Do we have that clip, guys?
[03:26:10.085 --> 03:26:10.465]  Here it is.
[03:26:11.486 --> 03:26:14.748]  Because we had a fire alarm earlier that day, and that was a drill.
[03:26:14.768 --> 03:26:16.729]  So we thought this was a drill too, just another one.
[03:26:16.749 --> 03:26:20.652]  Because we have a lot of fire alarms, a lot of fire drills at the school.
[03:26:24.062 --> 03:26:26.285]  After we heard the first gunshot, we initially thought it was a drill.
[03:26:26.305 --> 03:26:28.048]  Actually, that was a bad choice.
[03:26:28.068 --> 03:26:29.590]  It's okay.
[03:26:29.610 --> 03:26:29.911]  You're fine.
[03:26:30.752 --> 03:26:33.576]  Actually, that was a bad choice because the janitor... Sorry.
[03:26:33.616 --> 03:26:33.916]  It's okay.
[03:26:33.936 --> 03:26:34.417]  You're fine, David.
[03:26:34.677 --> 03:26:35.198]  You're fine.
[03:26:37.932 --> 03:26:39.433]  Bless his little heart, bless his little heart.
[03:26:39.453 --> 03:26:42.135]  Let me let you in on something, by the way, with this.
[03:26:42.656 --> 03:26:49.581]  When you watch somebody and they have that pause, um, when you look at somebody who speaks... When you're not scripted, you don't shut up like I do or you do.
[03:26:49.642 --> 03:26:50.762]  You can't shut in.
[03:26:50.843 --> 03:26:53.625]  It's clearly, he's like, sorry, just like in acting.
[03:26:53.685 --> 03:26:55.366]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[03:26:55.406 --> 03:27:03.433]  Like when I was there with Keanu Reeves and we were on the writer's shooting scenes, and I like, thought I'd do a great job, and once it was actually lines, I'm like, oh crap, sorry, 10 takes.
[03:27:03.513 --> 03:27:04.874]  Sorry means sorry to the director.
[03:27:04.994 --> 03:27:12.157]  And you notice that there's that pause, there's the freeze look of terror, the realization of blankness, and then that flick of the eyes to the left and back again.
[03:27:12.177 --> 03:27:13.218]  Director.
[03:27:13.278 --> 03:27:13.898]  Yes, exactly.
[03:27:13.958 --> 03:27:23.302]  It's to whoever is off-camera, and it's an involuntary thing that you do when you're starting out, or when you don't know better, and you haven't learned your steel discipline yet.
[03:27:24.103 --> 03:27:26.884]  And you're alive, and you panic, and you're like, I'm sorry!
[03:27:26.944 --> 03:27:28.865]  And it's just a natural instinctive, like, reflection.
[03:27:28.865 --> 03:27:30.386]  Sure, and they'll go, oh, Jones is an actor.
[03:27:30.426 --> 03:27:31.968]  No, I've been in some movies, been in some stuff.
[03:27:32.288 --> 03:27:34.770]  When you're like, oh, sorry, you say sorry to the director.
[03:27:34.810 --> 03:27:36.151]  That's the thing.
[03:27:36.591 --> 03:27:40.454]  Yeah, no, it's like, sorry is like a, sorry, I messed up my line.
[03:27:41.015 --> 03:27:41.876]  I've got to restart.
[03:27:41.936 --> 03:27:44.598]  It means roll again.
[03:27:44.678 --> 03:27:45.959]  Sorry means a fresh take.
[03:27:46.179 --> 03:27:46.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:27:46.740 --> 03:27:47.680]  Can I... That's it.
[03:27:47.760 --> 03:27:49.041]  Sorry means... It's a fresh take.
[03:27:49.121 --> 03:27:50.262]  Can we cut?
[03:27:50.643 --> 03:27:52.224]  And can we redo that take?
[03:27:52.804 --> 03:27:54.766]  You watch an actor go, sorry, I messed that up.
[03:27:54.786 --> 03:27:55.687]  They go, yeah, they re-roll.
[03:27:55.987 --> 03:27:57.068]  You start over again, exactly.
[03:27:58.863 --> 03:28:01.546]  It's in the subtleties.
[03:28:01.826 --> 03:28:03.788]  So how bombshell is this, Jalen Martin?
[03:28:04.048 --> 03:28:06.370]  Because I want to fly you here to Austin, by the way.
[03:28:06.390 --> 03:28:09.333]  I want to get Nico, who does an amazing job, fly you here.
[03:28:09.353 --> 03:28:14.898]  I want people to actually see a real person who went against the grain and didn't go with the scripting.
[03:28:15.298 --> 03:28:16.700]  Any other key tidbits you want to add?
[03:28:18.461 --> 03:28:20.963]  Yeah, I do want to talk about those cameras again.
[03:28:22.146 --> 03:28:23.627]  I think we go next Sunday.
[03:28:23.647 --> 03:28:28.188]  I'm going to like make sure everybody in depth like sort of look and talk about those cameras.
[03:28:28.308 --> 03:28:30.369]  Those cameras are key to this whole thing.
[03:28:30.869 --> 03:28:38.211]  Actually, since David's father was in the FBI, I'm 1000% sure he knows something that he just hasn't put out there to everyone.
[03:28:38.831 --> 03:28:39.271]  Alright, alright.
[03:28:39.311 --> 03:28:40.012]  Hold on, hold on.
[03:28:40.032 --> 03:28:40.893]  I gotta hold you over.
[03:28:41.393 --> 03:28:46.056]  When you're saying cameras are the key, let's find out what you mean on the other side for a few more minutes.
[03:28:46.076 --> 03:28:48.238]  Then Owen Schroeder will be able to run wild here.
[03:28:49.039 --> 03:28:50.139]  And everything else.
[03:28:50.179 --> 03:28:50.460]  Look at him.
[03:28:50.520 --> 03:28:51.420]  Look at Owen in there.
[03:28:51.560 --> 03:28:52.581]  Little firecracker.
[03:28:53.322 --> 03:28:54.583]  Little firecracker.
[03:28:54.603 --> 03:28:56.204]  That's his nickname.
[03:28:56.244 --> 03:28:57.785]  Let's put him back up on screen.
[03:28:57.805 --> 03:28:58.606]  Put Owen back up.
[03:28:58.626 --> 03:28:58.866]  Look at him.
[03:28:58.886 --> 03:28:59.707]  He's actually crazy.
[03:28:59.807 --> 03:29:00.327]  Look at him.
[03:29:00.407 --> 03:29:02.529]  Look at... Oh, that's a little firecracker.
[03:29:03.089 --> 03:29:03.930]  Mike in Arizona.
[03:29:03.950 --> 03:29:04.970]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:29:04.990 --> 03:29:05.291]  Go ahead.
[03:29:06.224 --> 03:29:08.105]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:29:08.145 --> 03:29:17.530]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:29:18.663 --> 03:29:24.906]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:29:25.126 --> 03:29:27.267]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:29:27.367 --> 03:29:27.767]  Thank you.
[03:29:28.428 --> 03:29:30.909]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:29:30.929 --> 03:29:34.671]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[03:29:35.231 --> 03:29:38.212]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:29:38.252 --> 03:29:39.253]  They are quality.
[03:29:39.573 --> 03:29:40.853]  I can't wait to get some more.
[03:29:41.314 --> 03:29:43.975]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:29:44.215 --> 03:29:44.775]  Absolutely.
[03:29:45.256 --> 03:29:58.164]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back.
[03:30:08.101 --> 03:30:10.063]  Can you beat Oprah, by the way?
[03:30:10.103 --> 03:30:10.964]  Yeah, I'll beat Oprah.
[03:30:10.984 --> 03:30:13.066]  Oprah would be a lot of fun.
[03:30:13.186 --> 03:30:14.047]  I know her very well.
[03:30:14.247 --> 03:30:15.789]  You know, I did one of her last shows.
[03:30:15.849 --> 03:30:16.810]  She had Donald Trump.
[03:30:16.830 --> 03:30:17.811]  This was before politics.
[03:30:18.192 --> 03:30:18.992]  Her last week.
[03:30:19.653 --> 03:30:21.435]  And she had Donald Trump and my family.
[03:30:21.455 --> 03:30:21.995]  It was very nice.
[03:30:22.036 --> 03:30:22.896]  So I like Oprah.
[03:30:23.297 --> 03:30:25.019]  I don't think she's gonna run.
[03:30:25.079 --> 03:30:26.540]  I don't think she's gonna run.
[03:30:28.682 --> 03:30:30.263]  I know her very well.
[03:30:30.343 --> 03:30:32.284]  Gavin McGinnis, he agrees with the president.
[03:30:32.404 --> 03:30:37.706]  Hillary Clinton is nothing compared to Oprah Winfrey when you talk about incredible skeletons.
[03:30:37.766 --> 03:30:41.408]  And if she thinks she's really going to run in 2020, I think it's a bluff.
[03:30:41.428 --> 03:30:42.488]  Trump thinks it's a bluff.
[03:30:42.588 --> 03:30:45.429]  But Gavin McGinnis, he's really up on his Oprah history.
[03:30:46.350 --> 03:30:49.531]  Gavin, I mean, look, there's nothing wrong with being a prostitute.
[03:30:49.591 --> 03:30:54.954]  But pimping women, bringing women to Weinstein, all of it, this is mainstream news.
[03:30:55.334 --> 03:30:57.715]  Let's talk about why you think she's
[03:30:58.816 --> 03:31:05.463]  You think of, you know, the identity politics vote, the woman vote, the bitter vote, the millennial vote, the dumb vote.
[03:31:05.823 --> 03:31:09.767]  She's got all of these different votes that end up being more than 50% of the country.
[03:31:10.108 --> 03:31:14.693]  The people who generally have skin in the game and get politics, they're a minority.
[03:31:14.993 --> 03:31:18.517]  So I was kind of scared and then I talked to Roger Stone a second ago and he goes, dude,
[03:31:19.097 --> 03:31:19.718]  Relax.
[03:31:20.118 --> 03:31:23.021]  Can you imagine the kind of skeletons this woman has in her closet?
[03:31:23.361 --> 03:31:25.023]  And then he dropped it, but he's right!
[03:31:25.103 --> 03:31:26.184]  She's a lesbian!
[03:31:26.364 --> 03:31:33.510]  So I just think that Trump was alluding to that, and we've heard stories of her paying off people to hide lesbian affairs.
[03:31:34.231 --> 03:31:38.074]  She tried to hide that her husband was, I mean, her brother was gay, died of AIDS.
[03:31:38.474 --> 03:31:41.237]  She's tried to hide the fact that she didn't really grow up in poverty.
[03:31:41.517 --> 03:31:48.006]  I mean, she's such an obvious liar, and that works for daytime TV, but it won't work in politics, where everything has to be aired out.
[03:31:48.206 --> 03:31:49.568]  She doesn't have a chance in hell.
[03:31:49.828 --> 03:31:54.474]  And when we watch the Golden Globes, too, we know Mira Cervino isn't there, because she said no.
[03:31:54.975 --> 03:31:57.018]  But everyone else, you look at them and you go,
[03:31:57.578 --> 03:31:58.319]  Well, you're here.
[03:31:58.559 --> 03:31:59.459]  Did you say yes?
[03:31:59.479 --> 03:32:05.783]  I mean, Salma Hayek pretends she was a victim, but she did the lesbian scene in the movie for Weinstein.
[03:32:05.983 --> 03:32:15.768]  All these people followed the rules, and now after they've done this, which is really just very expensive prostitution, they put on their low-slung black dresses and go, me too.
[03:32:16.168 --> 03:32:16.849]  It's over now.
[03:32:16.889 --> 03:32:18.810]  I'm gonna stop being an expensive prostitute.
[03:32:19.130 --> 03:32:20.371]  No, sorry, it doesn't work like that.
[03:32:20.411 --> 03:32:22.192]  You can't get on your high horse when it's fashionable.
[03:32:22.292 --> 03:32:24.413]  Look, we know what Time's Up means.
[03:32:24.993 --> 03:32:32.256]  It means I knew, we all knew, we let it go, but now the jig is up and everyone can see the casting couch.
[03:32:32.556 --> 03:32:36.277]  So starting today, we're not going to popularize it anymore.
[03:32:36.297 --> 03:32:37.357]  We're not going to ignore it.
[03:32:37.958 --> 03:32:39.118]  Ooh, how brave!
[03:32:39.478 --> 03:32:45.280]  You let a thousand rapes go under the radar and starting today, you say time's up.
[03:32:45.560 --> 03:32:47.581]  You're not going to allow rape anymore because it went public?
[03:32:48.101 --> 03:32:48.541]  Wow!
[03:32:48.881 --> 03:32:51.142]  What a crusader for justice you are!
[03:32:51.382 --> 03:32:53.643]  We're so impressed you feminists!
[03:32:53.843 --> 03:32:54.643]  You want to get raped?
[03:32:54.903 --> 03:32:55.763]  You want to get abused?
[03:32:55.923 --> 03:32:56.783]  You want to get killed?
[03:32:57.003 --> 03:32:57.784]  Go to Hollywood!
[03:33:06.406 --> 03:33:09.047]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:22.887 --> 03:33:27.551]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:33:27.892 --> 03:33:29.433]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.054 --> 03:33:35.578]  Now if we can get Milo to stop talking about his favorite reporter, Owen Schroyer.
[03:33:38.741 --> 03:33:39.582]  We'll get somewhere.
[03:33:39.762 --> 03:33:43.505]  Owen little firecracker Schroyer.
[03:33:44.066 --> 03:33:44.766]  Okay, stop.
[03:33:49.969 --> 03:33:51.190]  Jaylen!
[03:33:51.370 --> 03:33:53.811]  You're like those women who say no when they mean yes.
[03:33:54.511 --> 03:33:54.972]  Stop it!
[03:33:55.132 --> 03:33:55.652]  Stop it!
[03:33:55.672 --> 03:33:56.673]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[03:33:56.833 --> 03:33:57.053]  Okay.
[03:33:57.713 --> 03:34:00.234]  Owen has a long line of ladies around the block for him, so.
[03:34:00.575 --> 03:34:00.935]  I'm sure.
[03:34:00.955 --> 03:34:02.436]  We've got Jaylen Martin.
[03:34:02.776 --> 03:34:03.656]  Jaylen, you're awesome.
[03:34:03.716 --> 03:34:05.157]  A survivor of this thing we joke around.
[03:34:05.177 --> 03:34:05.977]  This is very serious.
[03:34:06.338 --> 03:34:08.759]  They're doing the biggest anti-gun assault I've ever seen.
[03:34:09.199 --> 03:34:14.202]  They have got the Fantastic Four, not the other 3,000 students, on TV everywhere.
[03:34:14.902 --> 03:34:18.704]  You were telling me off air, we can't get into it, but you're getting pressure not to even do this.
[03:34:18.744 --> 03:34:20.005]  You've got a lot of courage, Jalen.
[03:34:20.745 --> 03:34:23.427]  So just other key things you'd like to impart to the viewers and listeners.
[03:34:25.788 --> 03:34:28.410]  Yeah, so the CNN Town Hall will be tonight.
[03:34:30.137 --> 03:34:36.123]  You know, like I said, there's a possibility that they screen all the questions beforehand, or they write the questions and give them to people.
[03:34:36.903 --> 03:34:38.445]  I know they're going to do that with ANRA.
[03:34:38.625 --> 03:34:39.586]  Oh, trust me, they're going to.
[03:34:40.086 --> 03:34:45.031]  Those questions will be pre-screened, pre-prepared, written by someone else, not us.
[03:34:45.671 --> 03:34:48.013]  And they're going to give them to them and say, hey, up, up this.
[03:34:49.094 --> 03:34:49.995]  That's what they're going to do.
[03:34:51.627 --> 03:34:58.550]  Unless the end, that's something they've never done before, which is actually allow people to speak their mind and not screen everything.
[03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:06.353]  I'm hoping that I'll be able to put what I feel, my views, and actual facts out there.
[03:35:06.833 --> 03:35:12.835]  Basically, that one look that Jake Tapper likes to get whenever he's confused.
[03:35:15.036 --> 03:35:17.737]  Which is pretty much all the time.
[03:35:18.018 --> 03:35:18.478]  It's more of a...
[03:35:21.917 --> 03:35:29.421]  Or the weeping willow, Anderson Cooper, who never manages to get through his story.
[03:35:29.441 --> 03:35:33.304]  Jalen, we will touch base with you tomorrow or tonight after all this unfolds.
[03:35:33.324 --> 03:35:37.426]  We appreciate your courage and thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:35:37.506 --> 03:35:39.067]  Oh yeah, thank you.
[03:35:39.087 --> 03:35:45.810]  Alright, let's bring in Owen Troyer to discuss all the different things that are unfolding right now.
[03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:46.871]  Don't look at me, I didn't say anything.
[03:35:49.484 --> 03:35:53.684]  Mrs. Owen Yiannopoulos.
[03:35:58.191 --> 03:35:59.652]  No, no, no.
[03:35:59.672 --> 03:36:02.353]  Mr. Alex Xenopolis, that's me.
[03:36:02.433 --> 03:36:05.553]  He'd be the daddy, not necessarily.
[03:36:05.714 --> 03:36:06.614]  I'd be Mrs. Schreuer.
[03:36:07.134 --> 03:36:08.774]  Let's stop making the jokes.
[03:36:08.854 --> 03:36:12.175]  I walk in today and I go, you're wearing a pink jacket with a pink background.
[03:36:12.195 --> 03:36:13.316]  This is very stereotypical.
[03:36:13.556 --> 03:36:15.536]  No, they changed it back when you came back.
[03:36:15.596 --> 03:36:16.957]  I said American flags are geedy.
[03:36:16.977 --> 03:36:22.158]  Listen, I had a beautiful pink and purple washed out... Let's go back to this.
[03:36:22.198 --> 03:36:22.618]  Sorry.
[03:36:23.098 --> 03:36:25.559]  Let's go back to Infowars, which is like Gay Planet now.
[03:36:27.476 --> 03:36:29.878]  The giant, the gay missiles hit the earth.
[03:36:29.978 --> 03:36:32.259]  It's like pew pew pew.
[03:36:32.279 --> 03:36:34.700]  Sorry Owen, Milo Yiannopoulos is here.
[03:36:34.720 --> 03:36:35.881]  We have to be very stereotypical.
[03:36:36.841 --> 03:36:40.183]  I actually thought that the background for Milo was groovy, baby.
[03:36:40.203 --> 03:36:41.824]  That's right.
[03:36:41.884 --> 03:36:43.925]  And you've got, what's going on with that microphone in your hand there?
[03:36:44.385 --> 03:36:46.506]  This is the wireless microphone, Alex.
[03:36:46.846 --> 03:36:47.987]  This is the one we're using today.
[03:36:48.007 --> 03:36:51.248]  And I'm just going to leave it at that because we've got some serious music coming.
[03:36:51.268 --> 03:36:54.370]  If you bring it a little closer and just tilt the angle up slightly.
[03:36:55.683 --> 03:36:57.725]  Somebody shut Milo down, please.
[03:36:57.885 --> 03:36:58.826]  Milo, I don't get that joke.
[03:36:58.866 --> 03:36:59.487]  What does that mean?
[03:36:59.547 --> 03:37:01.029]  This isn't the Alex Jones Show here.
[03:37:01.109 --> 03:37:01.950]  Hey, seriously.
[03:37:01.970 --> 03:37:03.351]  It's a family broadcast.
[03:37:05.153 --> 03:37:09.537]  How has this disintegrated with all these known Democratic Party operatives?
[03:37:09.838 --> 03:37:11.419]  We're not saying attacks didn't happen.
[03:37:11.439 --> 03:37:12.580]  We're not making jokes about it.
[03:37:12.881 --> 03:37:13.982]  This is very serious.
[03:37:14.783 --> 03:37:16.204]  No one's buying the official story.
[03:37:16.224 --> 03:37:16.725]  What's happening?
[03:37:17.622 --> 03:37:37.647]  Well, even at the start of this week, and towards the end of last week, when we were covering this, and we were seeing some of these other angles cropping up, like the students being in drama class, and David Hogg's dad being in the FBI, and all this other strangeness, you kind of reach this foggy area where you're just like, do I really want to touch that?
[03:37:37.687 --> 03:37:39.107]  Do I really want to talk about that?
[03:37:39.148 --> 03:37:40.628]  Do I really have to go there again?
[03:37:40.648 --> 03:37:42.408]  It just looks completely phony.
[03:37:42.928 --> 03:37:44.889]  Like a plastic banana.
[03:37:45.169 --> 03:37:50.370]  And so what they do is, if we cover things... You had to say banana.
[03:37:50.450 --> 03:37:54.051]  If we cover things like Sandy Hook... Is it not... When you say plastic, what do you think?
[03:37:54.071 --> 03:37:55.371]  We're talking about fake.
[03:37:55.431 --> 03:37:58.732]  It wasn't some weird, whatever psychology, Freudian stuff you got going on.
[03:37:59.332 --> 03:38:01.452]  I think of plastic, I think of plastic banana.
[03:38:02.173 --> 03:38:03.613]  I think that was only in Owen's head.
[03:38:03.973 --> 03:38:04.193]  Yeah.
[03:38:04.833 --> 03:38:05.453]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:38:05.473 --> 03:38:08.734]  Milo wasn't giggling at all, but there you guys go down that road again.
[03:38:09.234 --> 03:38:10.874]  I was just noticing something funny.
[03:38:10.894 --> 03:38:12.655]  This is just what happens when Milo comes around.
[03:38:12.675 --> 03:38:13.415]  Plastic vomit!
[03:38:15.585 --> 03:38:18.607]  A plastic face like Adam Schiff or Brian Stelter.
[03:38:18.687 --> 03:38:19.007]  I don't know.
[03:38:19.627 --> 03:38:24.150]  But the point is when we cover things like Vegas... Hillary's plastic under a heat lamp.
[03:38:24.350 --> 03:38:27.931]  Alright, Owen, let's get serious.
[03:38:28.052 --> 03:38:38.177]  When we cover these things that look like plastic, they look fake like the Vegas shooting and the Sandy Hook... And they say questioning something plastic is evil.
[03:38:39.033 --> 03:38:41.854]  But they don't even cover what you cover.
[03:38:41.894 --> 03:38:45.334]  So it's like, here's Anderson Cooper's nose disappearing off a blue screen.
[03:38:45.354 --> 03:38:46.515]  And you're like, well, what is that?
[03:38:46.575 --> 03:38:47.075]  That's strange.
[03:38:47.375 --> 03:38:51.376]  OK, here's all these pictures of the Fantastic Four that goes on CNN.
[03:38:51.396 --> 03:38:54.956]  These four kids are being force-fed everywhere.
[03:38:55.196 --> 03:38:56.157]  Alex, I've got a clip.
[03:38:56.517 --> 03:38:57.577]  I'm going to play it on The War Room.
[03:38:57.597 --> 03:38:58.317]  We can have these.
[03:38:58.337 --> 03:38:58.937]  You can play it now.
[03:38:59.017 --> 03:38:59.317]  Cue it up.
[03:38:59.337 --> 03:38:59.797]  All right.
[03:38:59.977 --> 03:39:05.218]  There's a clip where the one girl, I forget her name, Emma Gonzalez, is on air with David Hogg.
[03:39:05.639 --> 03:39:07.419]  And she's like, well, you know,
[03:39:08.019 --> 03:39:11.522]  When we go back to school, we're going to be back in school with our students.
[03:39:11.782 --> 03:39:12.602]  Oh, yeah, this is the one.
[03:39:12.642 --> 03:39:18.126]  She's like, unless, unless we have to do interviews, you know, unless we have to start working and doing it.
[03:39:18.346 --> 03:39:22.249]  I mean, they're already admitting that they're basically CNN reporters now.
[03:39:22.329 --> 03:39:23.770]  I mean, they're basically admitting it.
[03:39:23.830 --> 03:39:24.390]  Here's a clip.
[03:39:25.751 --> 03:39:28.433]  What did you both think about the president tweeting over the weekend?
[03:39:28.473 --> 03:39:28.993]  Very sad.
[03:39:29.013 --> 03:39:29.694]  This isn't the clip, guys.
[03:39:29.714 --> 03:39:32.776]  The FBI missed all the signs, signals sent out by... That's a nice clip.
[03:39:33.439 --> 03:39:34.159]  That's a nice clip.
[03:39:34.660 --> 03:39:35.060]  It's a good clip.
[03:39:35.080 --> 03:39:37.301]  It's the same interview, but it's at the end of this interview.
[03:39:37.342 --> 03:39:38.883]  That's from the beginning of the interview.
[03:39:38.923 --> 03:39:40.744]  How about I just give you a moment to break?
[03:39:42.585 --> 03:39:48.068]  You go check, you go check with... Why don't, why don't... No, no!
[03:39:48.209 --> 03:39:55.353]  I think Owen's wild, intemperate lust, which flares every time I'm in studio, has resulted in this terrible mistake.
[03:39:55.393 --> 03:39:56.034]  Get a blowout.
[03:39:56.454 --> 03:39:57.595]  Oh look, let's see, look at this.
[03:39:57.655 --> 03:39:58.415]  We're back now.
[03:39:58.535 --> 03:40:00.917]  We're back with the proper... Purple power.
[03:40:01.477 --> 03:40:02.057]  Seriously.
[03:40:09.665 --> 03:40:10.105]  Seriously.
[03:40:10.125 --> 03:40:11.385]  Let's get serious.
[03:40:14.446 --> 03:40:15.666]  Do you have the clip ready?
[03:40:16.546 --> 03:40:18.046]  I don't think they have the clip ready, no.
[03:40:18.066 --> 03:40:20.227]  Alright, I'm gonna let you take a pause.
[03:40:20.507 --> 03:40:21.667]  Owen, don't get upset now.
[03:40:22.907 --> 03:40:25.528]  You just relax over there, go over to the computer.
[03:40:25.668 --> 03:40:33.169]  Don't worry, your pretty head about to... Find the clip!
[03:40:33.829 --> 03:40:34.909]  Alright, go find the clip.
[03:40:35.650 --> 03:40:36.690]  Stop that, Milo!
[03:40:37.390 --> 03:40:38.130]  This is wrong!
[03:40:40.162 --> 03:40:44.485]  I feel like Charley Sedinko in Up in Smoke at the very last scene.
[03:40:45.065 --> 03:40:47.847]  Listen, let's get serious though.
[03:40:48.028 --> 03:40:50.049]  We make jokes all day, and I like the fact you're joking around.
[03:40:50.089 --> 03:40:50.709]  I pick up on that.
[03:40:50.729 --> 03:40:51.910]  It's a good brain wave.
[03:40:52.791 --> 03:40:54.472]  But they're coming after our Second Amendment.
[03:40:54.512 --> 03:40:55.373]  They know what they're doing.
[03:40:55.393 --> 03:40:56.533]  This is clearly organized.
[03:40:57.094 --> 03:41:00.636]  They clearly have little operations going on.
[03:41:00.696 --> 03:41:01.417]  How do we counter them?
[03:41:04.497 --> 03:41:17.130]  The most important thing that I think that the pro-Second and pro-First Amendment activists and ordinary Americans have at their disposal, the most important thing they have in their arsenal is that they really care, they're really sincere.
[03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:21.555]  The left seems to think that it can bully people on First and Second Amendment.
[03:41:21.635 --> 03:41:25.619]  I don't think the left realizes how seriously Americans take their freedom.
[03:41:25.939 --> 03:41:31.683]  How seriously Americans take their right to express themselves and their right to protect themselves, you know, and to bear arms.
[03:41:31.763 --> 03:41:34.926]  I've never seen people so upset by the bullying going on.
[03:41:35.126 --> 03:41:39.950]  Right, but I mean, you know, they can make these language adjustments with the political correctness stuff.
[03:41:40.250 --> 03:41:43.352]  They can put gay people on TV and who cares, whatever.
[03:41:43.372 --> 03:41:49.397]  Like, Americans will kind of let things go, which is one of the problems, you know, you sort of ratchet leftwards constantly because people are just like, oh, let it go.
[03:41:49.417 --> 03:41:50.398]  It's not worth the fight, not worth the fight.
[03:41:50.578 --> 03:41:54.140]  But if you come for free expression or you come for guns, you're going to lose.
[03:41:55.361 --> 03:41:56.061]  Exactly.
[03:41:56.181 --> 03:41:58.182]  First or second amendment, it's on, bitch.
[03:41:58.242 --> 03:41:58.702]  Exactly.
[03:41:59.182 --> 03:41:59.402]  Quite.
[03:42:00.242 --> 03:42:09.104]  And, you know, I think perhaps the misuse, let's call it misuse, of child testimony in this particular example.
[03:42:09.124 --> 03:42:11.965]  They're exploiting these poor young people.
[03:42:12.005 --> 03:42:12.885]  Well, here's the really bad part.
[03:42:12.905 --> 03:42:14.705]  They're like, I want to be in a movie or a TV show.
[03:42:14.725 --> 03:42:18.486]  They're like, no, you're in Michael Bloomberg's anti-gun extravaganza.
[03:42:18.506 --> 03:42:20.506]  But that's not the worst bit of the exploitation.
[03:42:20.606 --> 03:42:23.387]  I mean, you know, it's a sign of desperation that they're using kids in the first place.
[03:42:23.587 --> 03:42:25.348]  Did I just hear a Winston Churchill speech?
[03:42:50.320 --> 03:43:00.614]  With growing confidence and strength in the air, and even there to be silent and fair, our Navy across the seas will organize and deal with the response immediately!
[03:43:04.216 --> 03:43:22.505]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:22.606 --> 03:43:28.529]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:28.889 --> 03:43:29.569]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:29.669 --> 03:43:32.851]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:33.491 --> 03:43:34.452]  And so much more.
[03:43:35.012 --> 03:43:36.153]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:36.374 --> 03:43:38.095]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:38.115 --> 03:43:43.800]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:43.920 --> 03:43:45.121]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:45.141 --> 03:43:47.062]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:47.162 --> 03:43:49.544]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:49.744 --> 03:43:51.005]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:51.186 --> 03:43:52.987]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:53.548 --> 03:43:54.148]  Immune Wall.
[03:43:54.268 --> 03:43:55.569]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:55.689 --> 03:43:56.870]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:02.219 --> 03:44:08.244]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[03:44:08.585 --> 03:44:11.187]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[03:44:11.807 --> 03:44:15.230]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:44:15.511 --> 03:44:19.794]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:44:20.215 --> 03:44:23.477]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:44:24.378 --> 03:44:34.602]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:44:35.363 --> 03:44:43.906]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[03:44:45.547 --> 03:44:54.079]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[03:45:03.931 --> 03:45:08.372]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:45:08.592 --> 03:45:13.294]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:45:13.894 --> 03:45:19.755]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:45:20.235 --> 03:45:32.759]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:45:33.519 --> 03:45:35.080]  Unlike other systems.
[03:45:35.140 --> 03:45:40.624]  I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[03:45:40.644 --> 03:45:42.226]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:45:42.246 --> 03:45:44.107]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:45:44.447 --> 03:45:45.648]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:45:45.808 --> 03:45:46.849]  Doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:45:46.869 --> 03:45:48.250]  Doesn't drink anything.
[03:45:48.450 --> 03:45:49.930]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:45:50.431 --> 03:45:52.051]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:45:52.071 --> 03:45:53.852]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:45:54.212 --> 03:45:56.813]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:45:56.853 --> 03:45:57.713]  This is insane.
[03:45:58.113 --> 03:45:59.754]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:45:59.994 --> 03:46:02.554]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:46:02.995 --> 03:46:04.515]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:46:04.555 --> 03:46:06.376]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:46:06.396 --> 03:46:08.256]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:46:09.117 --> 03:46:15.038]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[03:46:15.298 --> 03:46:16.639]  All just moderate dose.
[03:46:18.168 --> 03:46:26.160]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[03:46:26.180 --> 03:46:28.484]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:28.584 --> 03:46:29.766]  But thank you for committing.
[03:46:33.826 --> 03:46:36.649]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:46:37.029 --> 03:46:39.631]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:46:39.651 --> 03:46:44.416]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[03:46:44.896 --> 03:46:51.021]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:46:51.041 --> 03:46:54.164]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:46:54.505 --> 03:46:55.806]  It's called reap what you sow.
[03:47:05.899 --> 03:47:17.805]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.166 --> 03:47:20.367]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:47:20.847 --> 03:47:23.308]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:47:23.829 --> 03:47:26.170]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:47:28.860 --> 03:47:31.962]  I love this song because then it goes into the misfits in about 30 seconds.
[03:47:33.783 --> 03:47:34.783]  It is a magic moment.
[03:47:35.023 --> 03:47:35.904]  The music's been good today.
[03:47:35.924 --> 03:47:37.705]  And we're being very, very triggering today.
[03:47:38.666 --> 03:47:44.569]  Which I've noticed with my more inclusive shows where I'm in being, I don't care how long people are into me having my freedom, you have your freedom.
[03:47:45.009 --> 03:47:46.410]  Those are the ones they really censor.
[03:47:46.530 --> 03:47:48.812]  Because the left, they run all the diversity.
[03:47:49.172 --> 03:47:50.213]  They control it all.
[03:47:50.253 --> 03:47:51.273]  They will tell you what to do.
[03:47:51.573 --> 03:47:53.815]  I have always considered you a champion of diversity.
[03:47:54.475 --> 03:47:55.856]  I do try to be a libertarian.
[03:47:55.956 --> 03:47:56.536]  I like everybody.
[03:47:56.856 --> 03:48:03.780]  And nowhere is this more obvious than in our glorious background today, which somebody somewhere in the control room has spent a lot of time on.
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:04.520]  This is beautiful.
[03:48:04.880 --> 03:48:07.342]  Look at this lovely glittering O on InfoWars.
[03:48:08.182 --> 03:48:09.883]  Gayed up InfoWars, especially.
[03:48:10.203 --> 03:48:11.784]  I will talk about... Especially for Owen.
[03:48:11.885 --> 03:48:23.474]  I talked about the LBGTQMZ3X59QQOP and I said as they add new groups well I have to like learn some giant 20-foot long deal and that turned into Jones claims gay men want to have sex with your car.
[03:48:23.494 --> 03:48:24.255]  I told you the story.
[03:48:25.016 --> 03:48:27.198]  I didn't say anything about gay men.
[03:48:27.658 --> 03:48:29.439]  I said like there's whole new things where...
[03:48:30.140 --> 03:48:34.204]  People identify as blind people, they identify as animals, they identify as five-year-olds.
[03:48:34.564 --> 03:48:36.326]  I said, a lot of this is just mental illness.
[03:48:36.786 --> 03:48:42.111]  And so the headline was everywhere, Jones hates gay men and they want to rape your car.
[03:48:42.512 --> 03:48:44.734]  They just use that to get everybody on board.
[03:48:45.254 --> 03:48:47.236]  What do you think the whole insanity agenda is about?
[03:48:47.637 --> 03:48:49.919]  Like just hundreds of new sexual things.
[03:48:49.939 --> 03:48:51.921]  It's just, it's crazy.
[03:48:52.588 --> 03:48:54.790]  Well, I think they want... Mechrophilia, that's it.
[03:48:54.970 --> 03:48:55.670]  Mechrophilia.
[03:48:56.251 --> 03:48:56.911]  Mechrophilia.
[03:48:56.931 --> 03:48:57.612]  Yes, yes, yes.
[03:48:57.792 --> 03:48:58.752]  You're in love with mech.
[03:48:58.973 --> 03:49:01.975]  People have a variety of peculiar fetishes.
[03:49:02.275 --> 03:49:03.736]  Autobots, transform!
[03:49:05.251 --> 03:49:06.852]  I am Optimus Prime.
[03:49:07.212 --> 03:49:08.653]  Who would be the hot one?
[03:49:08.793 --> 03:49:10.873]  I think it would be... Bumblebee.
[03:49:10.913 --> 03:49:12.734]  Bumblebee, because he can make you laugh.
[03:49:13.775 --> 03:49:14.695]  Optimus Prime.
[03:49:14.735 --> 03:49:16.476]  How about Megatron?
[03:49:16.596 --> 03:49:17.196]  Megatron is hot.
[03:49:17.456 --> 03:49:19.597]  Megatron could become like an escort.
[03:49:19.737 --> 03:49:20.357]  People have.
[03:49:20.437 --> 03:49:22.278]  Hire Megatron for one night.
[03:49:22.858 --> 03:49:27.580]  You'll only need the one because you need three months to recover from his adamantium.
[03:49:27.740 --> 03:49:28.521]  No, that's Wolverine.
[03:49:28.901 --> 03:49:30.041]  Alright, let's be serious.
[03:49:30.202 --> 03:49:31.382]  Owen, you found this clip.
[03:49:31.462 --> 03:49:33.063]  Owen Schroyer, getting serious.
[03:49:33.083 --> 03:49:33.463]  Go ahead.
[03:49:34.542 --> 03:49:43.010]  So, the viral clip is actually at the beginning that everyone's heard, where he's like, oh, Trump is disgusting, I can't believe Trump would say anything, David Hawk.
[03:49:43.270 --> 03:49:48.355]  But there's an interesting point that we're about to go here to at the end of the interview that they did with CNN a few days ago.
[03:49:48.375 --> 03:49:49.536]  This is child actor.
[03:49:50.257 --> 03:50:00.260]  Child Democrat, child anti-gunner, we're saying this is a shooting happened, but this is the admitted Democrat golden boy, and Mr. Hogg, what is Piglet telling us?
[03:50:00.700 --> 03:50:05.121]  And the strange thing that she says here is the host asks, are you going to go back to school?
[03:50:05.141 --> 03:50:07.642]  And she's like, yes, we'll go back to school and stand with our fellow students.
[03:50:07.742 --> 03:50:10.822]  Oh, but wait, actually, no, our priority is the media.
[03:50:11.103 --> 03:50:14.804]  If we have to do interviews and do television interviews, we'll have to go to work because we're working.
[03:50:14.824 --> 03:50:16.304]  Go ahead and roll the clip, guys.
[03:50:17.261 --> 03:50:21.504]  Hey guys, are you going to be able to go back to school this week or next week?
[03:50:21.544 --> 03:50:25.247]  Are you going to go back into the building where this happened?
[03:50:26.147 --> 03:50:29.870]  Well, first of all, the freshman building is being torn down.
[03:50:30.190 --> 03:50:34.193]  But the rest of the school, the rest of the school is staying up.
[03:50:34.253 --> 03:50:39.296]  And as soon as we can, we are going to go back into the school.
[03:50:39.316 --> 03:50:41.118]  As soon as they say school is on Monday,
[03:50:41.858 --> 03:50:42.599]  I'm going to be there.
[03:50:43.200 --> 03:50:43.980]  I'm pretty sure.
[03:50:44.161 --> 03:50:52.289]  Unless I have interviews or unless we have interviews or somewhere to be, we are going to be at school with the people who need us.
[03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:54.091]  We need to stand with our peers.
[03:50:54.131 --> 03:50:56.794]  We haven't had time to stand with our peers through all of this.
[03:50:57.174 --> 03:50:58.395]  We've been working so hard.
[03:50:59.556 --> 03:51:02.118]  David, obviously everybody remembers when we first met you on Thursday morning.
[03:51:02.158 --> 03:51:03.099]  We've been working so hard.
[03:51:03.119 --> 03:51:05.881]  We've had like nine cameras in our face already just this morning.
[03:51:06.601 --> 03:51:08.323]  We need to stay with our students.
[03:51:08.383 --> 03:51:09.704]  And no one else gets heard from.
[03:51:09.744 --> 03:51:10.804]  It's only us.
[03:51:10.904 --> 03:51:13.806]  We've been working really hard to read these words someone said.
[03:51:13.827 --> 03:51:14.747]  You know what?
[03:51:14.887 --> 03:51:16.809]  I sense a Decepticon invasion.
[03:51:18.172 --> 03:51:23.318]  The hosts on CNN, the hosts on NBC, Jimmy Kimmel, you know what liberals think working hard is?
[03:51:23.518 --> 03:51:25.641]  Reading somebody else's words into a camera.
[03:51:25.661 --> 03:51:29.545]  Now one of these kids think that they're reading, one of these kids think they're doing a difficult job.
[03:51:29.745 --> 03:51:33.149]  They're doing the same thing as Anderson Cooper.
[03:51:34.010 --> 03:51:35.972]  Autobot enemy, where are we?
[03:51:37.301 --> 03:51:40.022]  Well, they're going to keep bringing these kids on television, obviously.
[03:51:40.062 --> 03:51:42.364]  I just heard it from Emma Gonzalez.
[03:51:42.384 --> 03:51:46.446]  These children are under Decepticon influence.
[03:51:46.706 --> 03:51:48.347]  She's a reporter for CNN now.
[03:51:48.647 --> 03:51:52.769]  She's got television interviews to do in Europe, in America, you know, wherever it is.
[03:51:52.809 --> 03:51:55.371]  Whoever comes calling, that's her first priority.
[03:51:55.431 --> 03:51:56.451]  She's going to do the interview.
[03:51:56.511 --> 03:51:58.212]  She's going to tell you the anti-gun rhetoric.
[03:51:58.612 --> 03:52:01.254]  Oh, but I'll be in school to stand with my students.
[03:52:01.274 --> 03:52:02.154]  Wait, what's that, CNN?
[03:52:02.194 --> 03:52:02.995]  You need me for an interview?
[03:52:03.235 --> 03:52:03.835]  Sorry, students.
[03:52:03.875 --> 03:52:04.195]  Megatron.
[03:52:07.157 --> 03:52:11.381]  So on Thursday class we're gonna be having a test on Pythagoras.
[03:52:11.501 --> 03:52:12.161]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:52:12.181 --> 03:52:13.703]  I have to do MSNBC.
[03:52:15.393 --> 03:52:18.234]  And again, only the Fantastic Four get on TV.
[03:52:18.614 --> 03:52:19.915]  No, no, no, no.
[03:52:20.915 --> 03:52:29.598]  There's gonna be an outbreak of like Antifa activism on campus and it'll just be kids desperate to get on TV because they've correctly recognized that the further left you're part of.
[03:52:29.738 --> 03:52:30.178]  I agree.
[03:52:30.298 --> 03:52:34.420]  In fact, I think this town hall is an audition for new people.
[03:52:34.840 --> 03:52:39.462]  They're saying through our four, we must convert more to the operations.
[03:52:40.142 --> 03:52:41.162]  Megatron, what is your...
[03:52:45.507 --> 03:52:47.590]  I always thought the Decepticons were the cool ones.
[03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:49.192]  I thought the Autobots were the losers.
[03:52:49.232 --> 03:52:50.734]  I think Democrats would be Autobots.
[03:52:51.154 --> 03:52:54.158]  The cool, sexy Decepticons would be us.
[03:52:54.558 --> 03:52:54.999]  Come on now.
[03:52:56.140 --> 03:52:57.261]  They're getting serious now.
[03:52:58.163 --> 03:52:59.845]  Tell us about Decepticons, Owen.
[03:53:00.953 --> 03:53:03.794]  I think there might be a Decepticon sitting to your left, Alex.
[03:53:04.254 --> 03:53:04.495]  Yeah.
[03:53:05.215 --> 03:53:07.816]  Oh, so you're a mecha-philiac as well.
[03:53:09.857 --> 03:53:11.538]  Hey, listen, we can sit around.
[03:53:11.578 --> 03:53:13.758]  This is the next big assault on the Second Amendment.
[03:53:14.139 --> 03:53:14.779]  They are.
[03:53:14.859 --> 03:53:15.819]  Soros is funding it.
[03:53:15.899 --> 03:53:16.760]  March is everywhere.
[03:53:16.780 --> 03:53:19.121]  We joke around, but this is serious.
[03:53:19.781 --> 03:53:26.683]  I haven't seen the press conference with Trump when he was going to have a listening thing with victims of Sandy Hook, but they all misrepresent that.
[03:53:26.703 --> 03:53:28.063]  They say that I say it didn't happen.
[03:53:28.343 --> 03:53:29.683]  They're always attacking me.
[03:53:30.163 --> 03:53:32.424]  They're always saying the president said this guy's a great guy.
[03:53:33.244 --> 03:53:34.064]  Did that happen yet?
[03:53:34.624 --> 03:53:35.885]  Let's Google Alex Jones' name.
[03:53:36.525 --> 03:53:39.166]  Did they attack the president yet about Infowars?
[03:53:39.366 --> 03:53:40.666]  They want to cut him off from his base.
[03:53:41.570 --> 03:53:47.472]  Yeah, I mean, one thing people haven't spoken about as much yet is this march that's supposed to be happening.
[03:53:47.692 --> 03:53:49.673]  I mean, where does the money come from for this organisation?
[03:53:50.133 --> 03:53:53.435]  These marches take staff, and you know that when you've seen these... Stop!
[03:53:53.455 --> 03:53:54.395]  None of what they said!
[03:53:55.256 --> 03:53:59.177]  The Women's Me Too March is now helping run it.
[03:53:59.337 --> 03:54:00.418]  Well, that's George Soros.
[03:54:00.458 --> 03:54:02.598]  So this is George Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[03:54:02.618 --> 03:54:08.620]  The Women's March was run by Linda Sarsour, a jihadist and an Islamist.
[03:54:17.250 --> 03:54:18.090]  That's the next meme.
[03:54:23.632 --> 03:54:26.533]  He cut the women's genitals off, we killed a gay liberal!
[03:54:29.335 --> 03:54:32.956]  That's about 40 IQ points higher than the actual Linda Sarsour.
[03:54:35.858 --> 03:54:37.779]  The Jihad is here!
[03:54:37.799 --> 03:54:39.881]  You are under our control!
[03:54:39.921 --> 03:54:41.682]  We kill your women, ha ha!
[03:54:41.942 --> 03:54:45.825]  Cut their genitals off, and kill the toy you are building, Milo!
[03:54:46.305 --> 03:54:52.089]  And we do it, it's liberal, and the media covers it up, because they love Jihad!
[03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:54.291]  They love Jihad!
[03:54:55.011 --> 03:54:57.433]  And once you are Jihad, you are Allah!
[03:55:00.530 --> 03:55:07.112]  Do you like that?
[03:55:07.313 --> 03:55:10.714]  What's left of the InfoWars set as it surrounds us?
[03:55:10.854 --> 03:55:12.154]  Owen, let's all do it together.
[03:55:12.174 --> 03:55:17.876]  Owen, do your... Do it!
[03:55:18.256 --> 03:55:19.077]  Do it!
[03:55:19.117 --> 03:55:21.097]  This is the daily call to prayer.
[03:55:21.117 --> 03:55:22.178]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:55:30.450 --> 03:55:30.570]  Allah!

[03:55:48.767 --> 03:55:48.988]  Allah!

[03:55:50.930 --> 03:55:51.050]  Allah!
[03:55:51.070 --> 03:55:51.350]  Allah!
[03:55:51.410 --> 03:55:51.570]  Allah!
[03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.690]  Allah!
[03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.850]  Allah!
[03:55:51.870 --> 03:55:52.091]  Allah!
[03:55:52.131 --> 03:55:52.291]  Allah!
[03:55:52.531 --> 03:55:52.711]  Allah!
[03:55:52.731 --> 03:55:52.831]  Allah!
[03:55:52.931 --> 03:55:53.072]  Allah!
[03:55:53.092 --> 03:55:53.472]  Allah!
[03:55:53.552 --> 03:55:53.672]  Allah!
[03:55:53.692 --> 03:55:53.812]  Allah!
[03:55:53.832 --> 03:55:53.932]  Allah!
[03:55:53.952 --> 03:55:54.072]  Allah!

[03:55:55.394 --> 03:55:55.574]  Allah!
[03:55:55.814 --> 03:56:02.357]  It is liberal, it is halal, and it cuts the women's pee-pee off for George Soros.
[03:56:02.637 --> 03:56:11.321]  He's spirit cook, he know best for you, and we big bank, Goldman Sachs take care of your poo-poo.
[03:56:11.881 --> 03:56:20.885]  So, let Goldman Sachs put pee-pee in poo-poo, and it will all be okay, and let the Somali jab knife in your throat, then you will reach halal.
[03:56:21.425 --> 03:56:24.773]  Is that a good shot there?
[03:56:30.819 --> 03:56:42.745]  I sometimes look at poor Owen and I think, did he have the slightest idea what his life was going to become?
[03:56:42.765 --> 03:56:50.890]  I like the Imam of Jerusalem says, O West is weak, your women pigs are ours to carry the sperm of the goblin pig.
[03:56:51.330 --> 03:56:52.150]  We rule you!
[03:56:56.988 --> 03:57:00.513]  It's very good, you have a very good... But no one should wake up from the coma, just give in to it.
[03:57:00.573 --> 03:57:02.736]  George Soros, the Islamic Horde, just go...
[03:57:13.970 --> 03:57:15.211]  It's a very good Arabic impression.
[03:57:15.271 --> 03:57:16.112]  You like the next level?
[03:57:16.693 --> 03:57:23.298]  Anyways, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, IncredibleSpecialsAtDangerous.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:23.618 --> 03:57:30.744]  If you don't want to be gang raped and thrown off a building and have your genitals cut off and live in a giant hell hole, then you might want to support InfoWars.com, if not.
[03:57:30.904 --> 03:57:38.110]  If you believe that animals should be free from molestation by migrants, petting zoos should be places of peace, calm, and love.
[03:57:38.530 --> 03:57:40.672]  It is halal to have sex with sheep.
[03:57:41.312 --> 03:57:47.953]  I started working with some of the top labs in the country many years ago, but intensely the last year, to bring out a lot of new brands.
[03:58:05.464 --> 03:58:22.672]  And I said, what is the cleanest, healthiest thing that goes after seasonal distress, the things that pollen and dust and all the trees and plants cause, but that doesn't have even herbs in it that speed up the metabolism and get you in a heightened state?
[03:58:22.692 --> 03:58:24.013]  Because sure, you're all jazzed up.
[03:58:24.053 --> 03:58:25.994]  Your body's going to ignore the fact that it's under attack.
[03:58:26.014 --> 03:58:30.376]  I said, what naturally deals with it, but helps the body in its own way actually heal it?
[03:58:30.836 --> 03:58:33.698]  And they said, well, that is Japanese quail eggs
[03:58:34.994 --> 03:58:39.359]  The type of quail, Japanese quail, fed a specific diet by the French.
[03:58:39.979 --> 03:58:41.341]  They discovered this like 40 years ago.
[03:58:41.381 --> 03:58:50.651]  It's not patented, not documented, but it's got better rates in the studies than placebos and then, you know, a lot of other products that are out there.
[03:58:50.671 --> 03:58:59.761]  So I continue to marvel at Mother Nature and what God gave us on this planet because the results we've gotten
