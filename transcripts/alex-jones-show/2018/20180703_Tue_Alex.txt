[00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:37.286]  Alright, I have a tendency to start the broadcast and then give you a whole lineup of what's coming up and then miss the top story of the day.
[00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:39.807]  The top exclusive of the day.
[00:00:39.827 --> 00:00:45.229]  I have a lot of sources, obviously, high up in the
[00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:57.680]  Trump movement, the Trump campaign, the White House, despite all the attempts by the globalists to block that, and as everyone knows, Trump has been
[00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.231]  Sidelining Kelly more and more and getting back to being the old Trump.
[00:01:03.912 --> 00:01:06.033]  But we've seen even more success accelerated.
[00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:09.475]  And so some of those avenues, let's just say, have opened up.
[00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:11.577]  And the only reason I mention that is it's not a secret.
[00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:13.658]  The globalists surveil my phones.
[00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:14.419]  They know what's going on.
[00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.441]  The deep states out there, we're removing the face sucker.
[00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:21.103]  We're removing the parasite right now.
[00:01:21.183 --> 00:01:22.805]  But the surgery is going well.
[00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:24.726]  There is a lot of bleeding in the patient.
[00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:29.538]  The patient was in critical condition on death's doorstep.
[00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:33.201]  Now we're just in critical condition, but I think we're starting to trend towards making it.
[00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:34.962]  We're not out of the woods yet.
[00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:47.292]  So, you can actually pull up clips of this, and I forgot to tell the crew to pull up clips of Trump during debates telling Jeb, you better watch it for what you and your brother did on 9-11.
[00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:50.175]  And then Jeb dropped out the next day.
[00:01:52.196 --> 00:02:00.720]  And then I was on the inside baseball with the whole thing with Ted Cruz and his dad, who absolutely was in the CIA, from all evidence.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.381]  And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:03.801]  The whole CIA isn't bad.
[00:02:04.262 --> 00:02:11.305]  He just so happened to be jacked into the whole same situation with the Kennedy assassination, but that had Cubans all over it.
[00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:15.707]  But that's a whole other subject, Rafael Cruz.
[00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:17.848]  You saw what Cruz did right after that came out.
[00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.790]  He dropped out and stopped trying to steal the election.
[00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:31.908]  Trump is preparing to release the 9-11 information on the Bushes, the Clintons, Muellers aside, or Derv.
[00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.510]  And I gave Paul the information last night.
[00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:37.393]  I got the info at about 10 o'clock at night.
[00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:45.019]  And then Paul got it out this morning, and his article's important, and it's got it all in there.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.241]  But Paul's always a little reserved.
[00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:53.886]  I may have to change his headline, or I may write another article myself, just because this is much, much bigger.
[00:02:55.066 --> 00:03:14.566]  And what I was told was, you know, we know they covered up, we know they stood down, we know Mueller ran the cover-up, that's even been in mainstream news before, and it ties into the corrupt elements that were in Saudi Arabia at the time, the whole deep state, and if they want to try to remove America's recovery, we're going to play the ace of spades.
[00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.190]  You notice, I've not been pushing 9-11 truth the last year and a half.
[00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:20.567]  And that's just in the ether.
[00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:21.848]  I know how to coordinate all this.
[00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.209]  Because I want to make America come back.
[00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.230]  I don't want to demoralize us.
[00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.352]  A criminal element staged that with the globalists.
[00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:30.475]  To not take out the radical Islam, but to actually go put it in power.
[00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.937]  And we now know all that and it's come out in 28 pages.
[00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:37.141]  But I've backed off of it because I was exposing the folks that did it.
[00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:41.704]  As we begin to heal the country, then I start backing off because that's enough pain.
[00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:43.726]  We've already gone through having our legs broken.
[00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:48.110]  But now, if we have to,
[00:03:49.898 --> 00:03:50.559]  Ace of Spades.
[00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:51.479]  BAM!
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.480]  BAM!
[00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:53.441]  BAM!
[00:03:55.683 --> 00:03:58.405]  And Trump is ready to play it on you.
[00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:02.689]  So you go ahead and play your games, Globalist Soros, all of you.
[00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:04.570]  You're all going down.
[00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:06.652]  This is the broadcast.
[00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:07.293]  This is where we do it.
[00:04:07.353 --> 00:04:08.033]  We're launching it.
[00:04:08.093 --> 00:04:09.374]  We're warming up the salvo.
[00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:10.175]  No one else will do.
[00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.217]  We're hitting the barbed wire as the shock force.
[00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:15.834]  So coming up, Roger Stone had a little talk with him last night.
[00:04:15.874 --> 00:04:18.196]  Turns out, Little Birdy's told him as well.
[00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:21.617]  And so, this is what's happening.
[00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:23.318]  So, get ready.
[00:04:23.818 --> 00:04:28.561]  Anything happens to Trump, all of it, the names, who did it, the stand-downs, the generals.
[00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:33.463]  Just like Pchenik says, he's been in the meetings with the generals that admitted they were part of it and didn't like being part of it.
[00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:39.907]  So, can we come back in with Motorhead, Ace of Spades?
[00:04:41.158 --> 00:04:42.239]  The Ace of Spades.
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.561]  The Ace of Spades.
[00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:45.183]  The Ace of Spades.
[00:04:45.663 --> 00:04:46.805]  The Ace of Spades.
[00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:47.706]  Boom!
[00:04:47.766 --> 00:04:48.086]  Boom!
[00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:48.467]  Boom!
[00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:49.828]  We will crush you!
[00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:50.749]  We will win!
[00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.891]  America will come back!
[00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:53.012]  Ha ha ha!
[00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:56.637]  And now, the Death Star is clear to fire!
[00:04:56.657 --> 00:04:58.038]  Ha ha!
[00:04:58.158 --> 00:04:58.939]  Yes!
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.101]  Victory!
[00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.625]  This 4th of July is special.
[00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:07.126]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:11.791]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:15.734]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[00:05:16.455 --> 00:05:21.520]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.303]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[00:05:26.144 --> 00:05:28.025]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:30.306]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[00:05:30.386 --> 00:05:33.487]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[00:05:33.527 --> 00:05:40.210]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.551]  We have record sales going on right now.
[00:05:43.536 --> 00:05:45.578]  Free shipping on hundreds of different items.
[00:05:45.918 --> 00:05:48.880]  More than 20 items are 50% off, like Rainforest Plus.
[00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:50.661]  X2 is 40% off.
[00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:52.683]  Knockout Sleep Aid, $17.76.
[00:05:53.343 --> 00:05:55.845]  Silver Bullets, $9.95, little silver.
[00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.327]  And free shipping, you can't beat that.
[00:05:58.648 --> 00:06:01.670]  This Fourth of July is special, and our sales are special to match it.
[00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.971]  Infowarestore.com.
[00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:10.465]  We are on the march.
[00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:13.427]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:06:13.527 --> 00:06:15.348]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.191]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to name.
[00:06:19.351 --> 00:06:28.036]  You win some, lose some, and do the same to me.
[00:06:28.056 --> 00:06:32.338]  The pleasure is to blame.
[00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:35.020]  Ain't no difference what you say.
[00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:37.586]  Life is coming back.
[00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:38.727]  Humanity is coming back.
[00:06:38.827 --> 00:06:40.148]  Nationalism is coming back.
[00:06:41.288 --> 00:06:42.589]  Humanity is awakening.
[00:06:44.531 --> 00:07:03.044]  The Ace of Spades, ladies and gentlemen, July 4th, 2018 will be the demarcation line of the launch of the new renaissance and the true new American century and the beginning of the end of the globalist as humanity prepares to face the next level of challenges.
[00:07:04.434 --> 00:07:09.176]  We are surpassing the globalists at this point at every level, but they are in their death throes.
[00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:12.758]  They are striking back with everything they've got.
[00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:18.901]  We have incredible news coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:23.183]  NBC's Chuck Todd admits President Trump winning.
[00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.184]  Democrats reeling.
[00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.891]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:36.918]  Progressives scramble to block potential Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett because she is a committed Christian.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:48.548]  A man who threatened to murder Rand Paul's children to gut them and smear their intestines everywhere is an Obama-supporting Berkeley resident.
[00:07:48.608 --> 00:07:53.853]  Of course he is, and now he's facing 10 years in prison with his ironic glasses.
[00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:01.907]  We've got so much to break down here.
[00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:07.109]  We've got Brian Ross is leaving ABC News after botched Michael Flynn report.
[00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:13.031]  You know where he lied and said, Flynn admits he's a Russian agent, and it's all coming out, and he told Mueller that Trump is a Russian agent.
[00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:13.932]  Total hoax.
[00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.052]  You know, Joy Behar, just got the news, yay!
[00:08:16.332 --> 00:08:18.113]  Trump's a Russian agent, total proof, ahh!
[00:08:18.933 --> 00:08:22.635]  Tom Arnold, oh, his lawyer admits they're Russian agents, I'm gonna have him on.
[00:08:22.715 --> 00:08:23.275]  Total lie.
[00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:25.576]  Hoaxing, hoaxing, hoaxing by the hoaxers.
[00:08:26.758 --> 00:08:31.380]  Bono warns that the existence of the UN, EU, and NATO, that means world government, are threatened.
[00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:32.341]  That's AP.
[00:08:35.963 --> 00:08:40.365]  We got all these Republicans and Trump officials being harassed everywhere.
[00:08:40.765 --> 00:08:44.787]  Scott Pruitt becomes the latest official to be harassed, the head of the EPA at a restaurant.
[00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:46.988]  It's all coming out.
[00:08:47.048 --> 00:08:52.451]  Oh, and there's a secret Roe v. Wade film filming right now with a lot of top stars shooting in New Orleans.
[00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:53.732]  I hadn't heard anything about that.
[00:08:55.205 --> 00:09:12.371]  So, we're going to be getting into all of those corollary issues, but let me, ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the biggest news concerning the fight with the deep state that I have covered in a long, long time.
[00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:22.254]  I've got a lot of good contacts inside Trump world at the highest levels, and
[00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:31.314]  Now that Kelly is receding towards being put out to pasture, those contacts have been heating up and have been particularly revealing.
[00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:41.361]  So, let me give you bombshell, first look information with myself and Roger Stone, right now.
[00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:46.805]  It's on InfoWars.com, it's on NewsWars.com, I've tweeted it out as well.
[00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:49.547]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson story.
[00:09:49.948 --> 00:09:53.210]  I relayed the information directly to him.
[00:09:55.475 --> 00:09:58.403]  Trump to go after Mueller for 9-11 Saudi cover-up.
[00:09:58.483 --> 00:10:01.211]  Now you'll remember in January of this year.
[00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:04.637]  Here is the Leanne McAdoo report on that.
[00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:08.499]  Next year's news today or the news of six months from now today.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.881]  Mueller's 9-11 cover-up connection.
[00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:13.022]  There's Leanne McAdoo's report on that.
[00:10:13.082 --> 00:10:19.727]  It's been in local Florida papers and other places that Mueller ordered the cover-up that Congress knew.
[00:10:20.327 --> 00:10:23.769]  FBI found direct ties between 9-11 hijackers and Saudis living in Florida.
[00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.030]  Congress kept it dark.
[00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.371]  That's all the stuff we covered.
[00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:27.912]  How they got bin Laden out of the country.
[00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:29.093]  How they protected him.
[00:10:29.653 --> 00:10:32.035]  And who gave the orders in the Justice Department
[00:10:32.775 --> 00:10:33.356]  To do that.
[00:10:33.896 --> 00:10:39.419]  This goes to the Clintons, the Bushes, the Muellers, the Comeys, the entire deep state.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:41.721]  Okay?
[00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:44.762]  So that is all about to come out.
[00:10:45.443 --> 00:10:57.690]  And so when you see some of the families of 9-11 victims on Tucker Carlson saying Mueller ordered that we couldn't have our lawsuit, he shut it down, he had the FBI not release the information, that is just the doorway to this.
[00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:00.112]  And so what I'm relaying to you is Trump
[00:11:01.075 --> 00:11:03.576]  Regardless of what the deep state does, he's going to bring everything out.
[00:11:04.076 --> 00:11:09.418]  But he had to first get some Supreme Court justices in, turn the economy around, show everybody he was real.
[00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:14.700]  And now he's preparing to not drain the swamp, but basically napalm it.
[00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:17.601]  Carpet bomb it.
[00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:24.064]  I mean, I don't know what you want to call this, but I have been told that this is the gateway to the traction.
[00:11:24.444 --> 00:11:25.344]  That's how Trump does it.
[00:11:25.365 --> 00:11:28.966]  He enters it at one unrefutable, irrefutable point that
[00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:38.200]  They covered up what happened on 9-11, that they blocked the lawsuits, that Mueller was the guy that quarterbacked all that, and then he quarterbacked the entire cover-up, brought in two days after 9-11.
[00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:50.877]  And that it goes into Saudi Arabia, it goes into the Bushes, it goes into the Clintons, who set it up beforehand, it goes into Saudi Arabia, Al Qaeda, and Trump has them dead to rights.
[00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:55.560]  He has all the documents, he has all the admissions, and he's letting them know, I have the ace of spades.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:06.267]  So, just like Trump back in, we'll pull the clip up, during one of the debates told Jeb Bush, yeah your brother did a terrible job on 9-11 standing down, the next day he dropped out.
[00:12:06.687 --> 00:12:08.509]  So we're going to play that clip coming up.
[00:12:08.549 --> 00:12:09.530]  The media criticized Trump.
[00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:15.356]  Trump famously called into CNN a week after 9-11 and said, boy, those buildings sure felt strange, like there was bombs in them.
[00:12:16.137 --> 00:12:17.699]  He wanted everything on record that he knew.
[00:12:19.401 --> 00:12:22.784]  So, Deep State working with radical criminal Islam.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.644]  Involving 9-11, the stand down, all of it, the CIA building, building 7 getting blown up.
[00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:41.437]  Trump is preparing and wants you to know and wants us to know and I am the individual that is supposed to say the super hard dangerous things up front.
[00:12:41.497 --> 00:12:42.058]  I'm very honored.
[00:12:42.078 --> 00:12:43.059]  I've asked for that position.
[00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:44.906]  I don't think we can
[00:13:06.047 --> 00:13:10.311]  Hype this enough how big this is and how huge this is.
[00:13:10.351 --> 00:13:15.256]  I called you last night at 1030 after I got off the phone and then received the information.
[00:13:15.316 --> 00:13:20.821]  You said that you were getting concurrent info and this is just the beginning of Trump's big rollout, his ace of spades.
[00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:26.025]  I mean, would you call this, the economy's his real ace of spades and telling the truth's his ace of spades.
[00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:30.470]  But when it comes to devastating the deep state, this torpedo, this black arrow,
[00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:37.013]  Well, I think the President has now only fully become aware of the extent of Robert Mueller's disastrous record as FBI Director.
[00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:39.434]  It is indisputable that he systematically ignored multiple reports
[00:13:57.407 --> 00:14:07.050]  About a Sarasota, Florida flight school where five of nine Saudi hijackers were training for the assault on America on 9-11.
[00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:23.056]  There were multiple complaints from neighbors about strange activities among these men who, according to flight instructors, showed an amazing interest in how to fly and take off, but no interest in how to land.
[00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:44.449]  This was reported to Jeb Bush's Florida Department of Law Enforcement, same thing as the state police in, say, Louisiana or the Texas Rangers there in Texas, who complained repeatedly to the FBI, sent reports to the FBI, which Robert Mueller systematically ignored.
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.905]  So, his role as being complicit in the cover-up of 9-11 is demonstrable.
[00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:56.289]  The president himself is going to ultimately make the case.
[00:14:56.369 --> 00:15:06.238]  But it's the tip of the iceberg in terms of this quote-unquote public servant who Lindsey Graham describes as beyond reproach.
[00:15:08.332 --> 00:15:13.076]  The first three suspects he arrested in the anthrax matter were the wrong men.
[00:15:13.096 --> 00:15:18.640]  The fourth man he ultimately arrested died mysteriously in custody.
[00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:34.231]  There is no question that he let three innocent men rot in a Boston jail in order to cover up FBI mafia informant sources in the Whitey Bulger matter.
[00:15:35.711 --> 00:15:53.323]  He had Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile, on the FBI hook as an informant, which explains why Epstein was always able to escape more serious charges such as child trafficking.
[00:15:53.883 --> 00:15:54.324]  That's right.
[00:15:54.384 --> 00:15:58.887]  Robert Mueller is confirmed to be the main handler of the main child trafficking.
[00:15:58.927 --> 00:15:59.907]  You heard it here first.
[00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:00.508]  We'll be back.

[00:17:11.507 --> 00:17:12.627]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:17:12.807 --> 00:17:13.227]  Hey, brother.
[00:17:13.247 --> 00:17:13.427]  Sir.
[00:17:13.727 --> 00:17:14.087]  Good, man.
[00:17:14.107 --> 00:17:14.907]  Thank you for calling.
[00:17:15.007 --> 00:17:15.207]  Hey.
[00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:15.547]  Hey.
[00:17:15.648 --> 00:17:20.048]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:17:20.268 --> 00:17:26.629]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:17:26.649 --> 00:17:28.470]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:34.731]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:36.991]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:17:37.051 --> 00:17:39.492]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[00:17:39.552 --> 00:17:41.072]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:17:41.453 --> 00:17:43.113]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:17:43.513 --> 00:17:44.233]  And exactly.
[00:17:44.253 --> 00:17:48.514]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:49.135]  Boom!
[00:17:49.275 --> 00:17:52.095]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:52.696]  It's amazing.

[00:17:54.116 --> 00:17:56.977]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:07.707]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:18:07.727 --> 00:18:08.248]  Thanks for holding.
[00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:09.248]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:18:09.748 --> 00:18:13.289]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[00:18:13.349 --> 00:18:26.493]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was pretty cool, and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests.
[00:18:26.613 --> 00:18:38.282]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield, and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.

[00:18:38.903 --> 00:18:47.430]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:52.254]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:18:52.394 --> 00:18:55.236]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[00:18:55.417 --> 00:18:57.307]  You, the crew and the listeners out there.

[00:20:05.929 --> 00:20:08.591]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.275 --> 00:20:29.099]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:29.199 --> 00:20:30.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:33.642 --> 00:20:50.113]  And here's President Trump two plus years ago telling Jeb Bush you better watch it buddy after what you did standing down in Florida and after what your brother did in DC and now Trump is preparing to start releasing the fact that the deep state was complicit working with radical Islam to carry out 9-11.
[00:20:50.194 --> 00:20:50.854]  Here's the president.
[00:20:53.197 --> 00:20:58.041]  Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, alright?
[00:20:58.582 --> 00:21:16.537]  Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took Jeb Bush, if you remember, at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced the President, it took him five days, he went back, it was a mistake, it wasn't a mistake, it took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said, it was a mistake.
[00:21:16.897 --> 00:21:20.380]  The war in Iraq, we spent two trillion dollars, thousands of lives,
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.601]  We don't even have it.
[00:21:21.921 --> 00:21:25.643]  Iran is taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[00:21:26.223 --> 00:21:27.684]  Obviously it was a mistake.
[00:21:28.205 --> 00:21:29.966]  George Bush made a mistake.
[00:21:30.006 --> 00:21:30.986]  We can make mistakes.
[00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:32.387]  But that one was a beauty.
[00:21:32.627 --> 00:21:34.548]  We should have never been in Iraq.
[00:21:34.588 --> 00:21:36.570]  We have destabilized the Middle East.
[00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.091]  So you still think he should be impeached?
[00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:38.751]  I think it's my turn.
[00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:41.693]  You do whatever you want.
[00:21:41.953 --> 00:21:43.154]  You call it whatever you want.
[00:21:43.214 --> 00:21:44.715]  I want to tell you, they lied.
[00:21:44.735 --> 00:21:47.457]  They said there were weapons of mass destruction.
[00:21:47.497 --> 00:21:48.217]  There were none.
[00:21:48.317 --> 00:21:49.438]  And they knew there were none.
[00:21:49.798 --> 00:21:55.002]  There were no weapons of mass destruction.
[00:21:55.522 --> 00:21:59.265]  And there's another clip too with him saying you screwed up on 9-11.
[00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:00.746]  You stood down in Florida.
[00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:02.487]  Your brother stood down.
[00:22:02.547 --> 00:22:03.728]  You guys did a terrible job.
[00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:05.529]  We're going to get that clip for you as well.
[00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:09.912]  We've also got the clip coming up in the next segment where he talks about bombs in the buildings.
[00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.449]  So again, this is really, really serious.
[00:22:12.489 --> 00:22:22.633]  The point is, Tucker Carlson has on some of the families where Mueller, on record, basically killed the investigation, didn't let them have the info to sue.
[00:22:25.214 --> 00:22:32.257]  And if you expand on that, we have the article on Infowars.com, Trump to go after Mueller for 9-11 Saudi cover-up.
[00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:40.673]  President about to drop the hammer on former FBI director for burying Saudi involvement in the attacks, as Roger Stone just mentioned.
[00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:42.333]  But this is coffin nails.
[00:22:43.213 --> 00:22:45.194]  This is kryptonite to the deep state, Roger.
[00:22:45.374 --> 00:22:54.756]  And again, the specific thing that I want to relay to everyone is, the exclusive here is, this is only the beginning of what Trump is going to start releasing.
[00:22:55.497 --> 00:22:59.918]  And he's the president, he has the right to declassify anything he wants, and he's letting them know
[00:23:00.967 --> 00:23:04.469]  Let's just say folks are letting them know that that's going on.
[00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.711]  So what does that signify?
[00:23:06.931 --> 00:23:13.015]  What do you make of this development that this is starting and that folks want the deep state to know we're coming for them?
[00:23:13.795 --> 00:23:23.862]  Well, I think the president is building the backfire necessary to terminate the partisan inquisition being led by Robert Mueller.
[00:23:24.554 --> 00:23:40.087]  I mean, that story in yesterday's or the day before's New York Times about Rod Rosenstein, who very clearly wrote a memo to the president advocating the firing of FBI Director Comey, did not think it would be made public.
[00:23:40.708 --> 00:23:43.310]  Trump, as it is prerogative, made it public.
[00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:49.355]  This embarrassed Rosenstein in front of his deep state buddies, where he was trying to have it both ways.
[00:23:50.076 --> 00:23:51.397]  He is furious at Trump.
[00:23:51.457 --> 00:23:52.518]  And his payback is?
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.161]  The appointment of Robert Mueller.
[00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:57.001]  It is as clear as day.
[00:23:57.581 --> 00:23:59.462]  So he's acting in his self-interest.
[00:23:59.502 --> 00:24:04.563]  He has conflicts in that he has gotten his first job from Mueller.
[00:24:04.663 --> 00:24:09.545]  He has conflicts in that he approves the FISA warrant personally.
[00:24:10.505 --> 00:24:13.926]  He's conflicted, more conflicted in this case than Jeff Sessions is.
[00:24:14.366 --> 00:24:17.367]  He needs to stand down or be terminated.
[00:24:17.767 --> 00:24:21.028]  So I think the president is laying the ground for the
[00:24:21.668 --> 00:24:30.731]  For the termination of what is a partisan witch hunt, people need to know more about Mr. Mueller.
[00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:36.993]  He is not the white knight that Lindsey Graham and others in the mainstream media have portrayed.
[00:24:37.473 --> 00:24:43.815]  His role during and after the 9-11 matter needs to be examined.
[00:24:43.875 --> 00:24:45.936]  The fact that he is the man who mules
[00:24:46.696 --> 00:24:59.082]  The uranium specimens to Stockholm to close the deal for Uranium One, at behest of the Clintons, shows that he is a bipartisan leg man for the deep state.
[00:25:00.023 --> 00:25:08.007]  And he is complicit, therefore, in the largest treasonous financial crime, in terms of dollars, in American history.
[00:25:08.979 --> 00:25:17.423]  And it's attempting to overthrow a duly elected president when we have the FBI, Justice Department conspiracy to keep him from getting elected, then try to stop him from getting in.
[00:25:17.443 --> 00:25:19.284]  They tried to not let the delegates be seated.
[00:25:19.824 --> 00:25:24.327]  Then they've been waging war against him, his whole family, you and I. Roger, I'll tell you, I called you last night about it.
[00:25:24.827 --> 00:25:26.608]  I've discovered whole new next level.
[00:25:26.948 --> 00:25:30.350]  Democratic Party has been caught red-handed in my personal life.
[00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.611]  Trying to actually wreck my family again.
[00:25:33.771 --> 00:25:35.692]  I mean, there is no end to these people.
[00:25:35.712 --> 00:25:37.313]  I've got to sue them now.
[00:25:37.633 --> 00:25:39.054]  They are so diabolical.
[00:25:39.294 --> 00:25:40.414]  They are so crazed.
[00:25:40.935 --> 00:25:46.217]  And then they use Alistair Crowley as the Democratic Party operating system?
[00:25:46.937 --> 00:25:49.899]  I mean, these people are beyond anything you could ever imagine.
[00:25:50.823 --> 00:25:53.004]  It is really, really extraordinary.
[00:25:53.044 --> 00:25:55.705]  But what it tells me is Trump's taking the gloves off.
[00:25:56.685 --> 00:26:06.108]  For too long, the early Trump attorneys' piece of legal advice was bend over and hand Robert Mueller the vacillate.
[00:26:07.378 --> 00:26:08.299]  Turn over everything.
[00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:09.999]  Waive all executive privilege.
[00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:12.720]  Give Mueller millions and millions and millions of privilege.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.621]  Make him God.
[00:26:13.701 --> 00:26:16.102]  Let him violate all these laws.
[00:26:16.962 --> 00:26:17.242]  Right.
[00:26:17.362 --> 00:26:32.328]  Ignore his use of material from FISA warrants, which is still the linchpin of this whole scandal, what Rosenstein struggles to cover up today, what is being used to harass me and Paul Manafort and others.
[00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:36.073]  So, this tells me Trump is going to war.
[00:26:36.153 --> 00:26:41.400]  It is essential the American people know who and what Mr. Mueller is.
[00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:42.482]  It is not...
[00:26:43.376 --> 00:26:43.976]  That's extraordinary.
[00:27:07.085 --> 00:27:16.391]  And now the President is telegraphing that he's going to start releasing the cover-up, the stand-down of 9-11, that implicates the Bushes, Mueller, who ran the cover-up itself, and the Clintons.
[00:27:16.892 --> 00:27:25.357]  Because we know Trump is really upset behind the scenes that it's the Bushes and their syndicate that are more effectively fighting his agenda than even the Democrats right now.
[00:27:25.738 --> 00:27:30.481]  And Chuck Todd now has come out and said President Trump is winning, Democrats reeling, close quote.
[00:27:30.941 --> 00:27:33.583]  So Trump now knows who to target, doesn't he, Roger?
[00:27:34.062 --> 00:27:42.151]  Well, look, the poll that I would like to see, which nobody has taken, there is a new poll which shows the two top fundrunners of the Democratic Party.
[00:27:43.032 --> 00:27:48.778]  Old, tired, sick, and bereft of ideas, but still just as greedy, Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:49.538 --> 00:27:50.359]  We're good to go.
[00:28:09.038 --> 00:28:11.159]  So, these are their nominees.
[00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:14.300]  I'd like to see them stacked in a legitimate poll.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.401]  Trump vs. Hillary.
[00:28:16.581 --> 00:28:18.322]  Trump vs. Biden for 2020.
[00:28:18.462 --> 00:28:21.923]  And I think you'd find the President would crush both of them.
[00:28:22.543 --> 00:28:26.785]  If he ran against Hillary again tomorrow, he would crush her by a larger margin.
[00:28:27.025 --> 00:28:28.025]  That's why Michael Moore panicked.
[00:28:28.046 --> 00:28:31.127]  He went on Bill Maher this weekend and said, we've got to have an uprising.
[00:28:31.147 --> 00:28:32.348]  A million people surround the Capitol.
[00:28:32.388 --> 00:28:34.148]  Don't let the new Supreme Court pick you in.
[00:28:34.189 --> 00:28:36.710]  And he goes, because Trump's going to win in 2020.
[00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.031]  And America's coming back, and they are crapping their britches.
[00:28:40.572 --> 00:28:42.092]  No, and they're absolutely right.
[00:28:42.212 --> 00:28:43.613]  We need to have an uprising.
[00:28:43.793 --> 00:28:50.056]  Circle their circle around the Capitol, demanding a Supreme Court justice who believes in the rule of law.
[00:28:50.136 --> 00:28:50.637]  Be there.
[00:28:50.997 --> 00:28:52.538]  Surround their surrounding.
[00:28:52.678 --> 00:28:53.298]  That's my view.
[00:28:53.878 --> 00:28:54.600]  Let's do a few more minutes.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.966]  I want to play this clip of Trump talking about 9-11 and then ask you a few other key questions straight ahead with Roger Stone.
[00:28:58.986 --> 00:28:59.567]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:05.723 --> 00:29:09.805]  What you're about to see are two presidents of the teachers union.
[00:29:09.925 --> 00:29:12.647]  One guy named Dave Perry near Trenton, New Jersey.
[00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:15.969]  Another named Kathleen Valencia in Union City, New Jersey.
[00:29:15.989 --> 00:29:20.151]  And they're talking about covering up child abusers in the public schools.
[00:29:20.832 --> 00:29:23.433]  Dave Perry, the statements he makes are so shocking.
[00:29:23.493 --> 00:29:27.115]  He actually says, we want to turn it back around onto the child.
[00:29:27.135 --> 00:29:28.156]  He says, it's my job.
[00:29:28.756 --> 00:29:33.161]  He says I'm gonna backdate it, that's commit fraud after the incident of abuse.
[00:29:33.621 --> 00:29:35.623]  He says that's his job at the teachers union.
[00:29:35.643 --> 00:29:41.529]  He's there to protect the worst people, he's there to bend the truth, and he's there to reverse it back onto the kid.
[00:29:41.569 --> 00:29:45.553]  There's me confronting Dave Perry, who denied the things he said.
[00:29:45.593 --> 00:29:46.674]  Now last night, Alex,
[00:29:47.534 --> 00:29:54.199]  The National Education Association and the NJEA, that's the New Jersey version of it, has suspended him.
[00:29:54.299 --> 00:30:02.824]  So they've suspended one union president and then just today, Alex, we released another woman in New Jersey saying that she was protecting child abuse.
[00:30:02.924 --> 00:30:04.445]  I don't want him coming here with a bunch of lies.
[00:30:04.505 --> 00:30:06.847]  I need to know the truth so that we can bend the truth.
[00:30:07.587 --> 00:30:08.348]  Okay.
[00:30:08.428 --> 00:30:11.371]  Oh yeah, I mean it was like a physical... Yeah, like a physical skirmish.
[00:30:23.658 --> 00:30:26.459]  I'm gonna date it back to the day after the incident.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:27.480]  Okay.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.460]  He was upset.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.200]  He was worried.
[00:30:29.541 --> 00:30:30.621]  He did shake the kid.
[00:30:30.861 --> 00:30:33.042]  So if they said there was bruises he had, there was bruises where?
[00:30:33.102 --> 00:30:34.863]  I gotta ask him where he hit him.
[00:30:35.803 --> 00:30:38.585]  Yeah, because he was trying to put him back in his seat because he was getting physical.
[00:30:38.945 --> 00:30:39.405]  It was tough.
[00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:41.286]  We reversed it onto the kid.
[00:30:41.986 --> 00:30:43.166]  Okay, yeah.
[00:30:43.366 --> 00:30:43.967]  That's my job.
[00:30:44.127 --> 00:30:46.867]  It's not a good job, but it's my job and what I have to do.
[00:30:46.947 --> 00:30:52.329]  This file right here is from a teacher who had sex with a student.
[00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:53.729]  Okay?
[00:30:53.749 --> 00:30:54.870]  You're not going to jail.
[00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.511]  You know what this whole file is about?
[00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:01.972]  It's about whether or not they get to keep their pension.
[00:31:02.572 --> 00:31:02.972]  Okay.
[00:31:03.932 --> 00:31:07.233]  The sex with a teenage girl.
[00:31:07.933 --> 00:31:09.694]  Okay.
[00:31:09.954 --> 00:31:10.534]  Is it going to jail?
[00:31:13.343 --> 00:31:15.944]  Now, I'm being as brutally honest with you as I can.
[00:31:16.745 --> 00:31:25.269]  If you are afraid of a middle school child who called you a d*** and spit on you and advanced towards you, you are in the wrong profession.
[00:31:25.289 --> 00:31:25.909]  Kid's fine.
[00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.390]  Kid's not hurt.
[00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.711]  Kid got a scratch.
[00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:30.712]  He's gonna give the kid a 65, right?
[00:31:33.294 --> 00:31:35.015]  He's not gonna fail the kid?
[00:31:35.055 --> 00:31:35.696]  No, no, no.
[00:31:35.716 --> 00:31:37.057]  He's not gonna fail the kid?
[00:31:37.697 --> 00:31:42.841]  He's gonna get that kid out of his f***ing classroom and move on fresh for September.
[00:31:43.422 --> 00:31:45.603]  We're facing a crisis in American education.
[00:31:45.824 --> 00:31:48.345]  And this week, the NJEA is under fire.
[00:31:48.826 --> 00:31:51.808]  Teachers unions would have you believe that they're fighting for our children.
[00:31:52.308 --> 00:31:58.093]  But the evidence in these tapes show they're fighting for themselves, their survival, and their own dominance.
[00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:08.140]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:08.661]  Thanks for holding.
[00:32:08.721 --> 00:32:09.642]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:32:10.082 --> 00:32:13.686]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:32:13.766 --> 00:32:22.514]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:32:22.554 --> 00:32:38.773]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[00:32:39.293 --> 00:32:47.819]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:32:47.879 --> 00:32:52.662]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:32:52.802 --> 00:32:57.705]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there.
[00:32:57.725 --> 00:32:58.045]  1776 worldwide.
[00:33:06.846 --> 00:33:09.587]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.375 --> 00:33:29.297]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:29.797 --> 00:33:31.258]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:37.219]  It was always known as a very, very strong building.
[00:33:37.259 --> 00:33:39.220]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.460]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place, because that's your foundation.
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.781]  And it withstood that.
[00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:52.862]  And I got to see that area about three or four days after it took place, because one of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour, because he did the building.
[00:33:53.022 --> 00:33:54.203]  And I said, I can't believe it.
[00:33:54.243 --> 00:33:58.303]  The building was standing solid, and half of the columns were blown out.
[00:33:58.383 --> 00:34:01.404]  I mean, so this was an unbelievably powerful building.
[00:34:01.984 --> 00:34:06.008]  Uh, if you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside.
[00:34:06.048 --> 00:34:12.575]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows, is that in between all the windows, you had the steel on the outside.
[00:34:12.615 --> 00:34:14.437]  See, the steel on the outside of the building.
[00:34:14.457 --> 00:34:17.540]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.285]  When I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it, because there was a hole in the steel.
[00:34:23.105 --> 00:34:27.147]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks?
[00:34:27.247 --> 00:34:30.169]  I think, you know, if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow.
[00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:32.630]  And in between was this heavy steel.
[00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:41.094]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or a 747, or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through this steel?
[00:34:41.694 --> 00:34:50.018]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall.
[00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:53.250]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.312]  The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign.
[00:34:55.332 --> 00:34:56.332]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[00:34:56.352 --> 00:34:57.053]  Remember that.
[00:34:57.073 --> 00:34:57.273]  Hold on.
[00:34:57.473 --> 00:34:59.334]  Let me finish this.
[00:34:59.395 --> 00:35:00.876]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[00:35:00.896 --> 00:35:01.516]  That's not keeping us safe.
[00:35:01.536 --> 00:35:05.939]  Look, I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago and looked up and I saw my mom.
[00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:07.720]  My mom is the strongest woman I know.
[00:35:07.921 --> 00:35:08.401]  She should be running.
[00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:10.583]  This is not about my family or his family.
[00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:20.059]  I'm putting a bookend on that, but there's Trump saying, and he owns a bunch of buildings in the area, and he talked to the structural engineer, and he's telling you, I think there were bombs in there.
[00:35:20.119 --> 00:35:24.643]  Well, we have the local news with them removing bombs, reporting there were bombs in the buildings.
[00:35:24.844 --> 00:35:27.166]  Bombs in Building 7, not hit by an airplane.
[00:35:27.526 --> 00:35:28.427]  Trump knows it all.
[00:35:28.507 --> 00:35:30.970]  He's getting ready to bring it all out.
[00:35:31.811 --> 00:35:32.592]  Now, segwaying.
[00:35:34.261 --> 00:35:35.581]  Talking to Roger during the break.
[00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:43.685]  He's got a big announcement to make to everybody here about what Trump has decided to do and why we see Kelly heading for the exits.
[00:35:43.765 --> 00:35:45.525]  Reportedly he'll be gone July 31st.
[00:35:46.506 --> 00:35:50.067]  Roger Stone, explain what Trump's decided to do for everybody out there.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.266]  Well, first of all, there's so much going on.
[00:35:55.366 --> 00:36:05.080]  I'd point out that my book, The Bush Crime Family, came out 11 days before that debate in which Trump confronted Jeb about his stand-down on 9-11.
[00:36:05.601 --> 00:36:07.604]  Now it will all come out.
[00:36:08.944 --> 00:36:22.431]  It is very important to note that one of those judges, Brett Kavanaugh, a Bush family favorite who seems to be among the frontrunners for the Supreme Court, has a minor problem.
[00:36:23.051 --> 00:36:27.674]  He is involved in the cover-up of the Vince Foster death.
[00:36:27.914 --> 00:36:36.418]  Now, while it has never been established as to whether Foster, a top aide to Bill and Hillary Clinton, the keeper of all their secrets,
[00:36:36.698 --> 00:36:37.258]  I think?
[00:36:53.025 --> 00:37:10.258]  A man named Patrick Knowlton, just an honest citizen, was in the wrong place at the wrong time and saw things he shouldn't have seen pertaining to the dumping of Foster's body, and he was harassed by special counsel Brett Kavanaugh.
[00:37:11.118 --> 00:37:20.722]  A clean-up man for the Clintons in shutting down the investigation into how Vince Foster's body got to Fort Marcy Park.
[00:37:20.762 --> 00:37:24.163]  So we definitely don't want him, and we also know Napolitano could be in the running.
[00:37:24.183 --> 00:37:26.744]  We also have this lady who is a Christian.
[00:37:27.664 --> 00:37:30.666]  That's Amy Connie Barrett.
[00:37:30.686 --> 00:37:31.286]  What do you think of her?
[00:37:32.006 --> 00:37:34.247]  Well, she is a stout Catholic.
[00:37:34.667 --> 00:37:39.470]  I'm worried about her not being as libertarian as perhaps I'd like.
[00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:44.412]  I'd like to see a libertarian on the judge, on the court, to balance the conservatives out.
[00:37:44.492 --> 00:37:47.173]  Judge Willett from Texas would be excellent.
[00:37:47.673 --> 00:37:55.377]  I'm coming to the conclusion that the president has come to the conclusion that although Napolitano is his emotional favorite,
[00:37:56.037 --> 00:38:00.001]  At his age, he is probably too old for this appointment.
[00:38:00.601 --> 00:38:06.627]  And there's now discussion about the judge re-affirming, re-coming back as U.S.
[00:38:06.807 --> 00:38:07.667]  Attorney General.
[00:38:08.188 --> 00:38:09.589]  An interesting concept.
[00:38:09.749 --> 00:38:11.331]  Ooh, Attorney General, that's right.
[00:38:11.631 --> 00:38:18.217]  Because that's a two to four year post, instead of... We want somebody young, that's why this lady would be great.
[00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:19.402]  I think?
[00:38:49.402 --> 00:39:02.533]  Now, in your own words, what you said to me during the break, when I told you about my conversation last night, and we also talked last night, you said, Trump has decided to, in your own words... Take the gloves off.
[00:39:02.613 --> 00:39:04.014]  I think he's going on offense.
[00:39:04.094 --> 00:39:07.878]  I think, look, the two Bloomberg stories this week, I think, told the story.
[00:39:07.998 --> 00:39:09.319]  You said Trump's going to war.
[00:39:09.955 --> 00:39:18.801]  He's going to war, because the story that says now that the, now Robert Mueller, according to Bloomberg, will focus on Russian collusion.
[00:39:19.281 --> 00:39:19.761]  Pardon me?
[00:39:20.822 --> 00:39:23.404]  He's had two years and spent $17 million.
[00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:26.206]  I thought that was what he was focused on.
[00:39:27.126 --> 00:39:31.609]  He's turned up nothing, but this one case is turning out to be an embarrassment to him.
[00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.331]  The 13 Russians that he can't convict.
[00:39:35.357 --> 00:39:38.702]  Uh, and who are demanding discovery.
[00:39:38.722 --> 00:39:50.157]  He has, then in a second story, said he will make decisions about charges against the president, which would have to be included in his final report in the fall.
[00:39:51.801 --> 00:39:52.742]  In October.
[00:40:08.374 --> 00:40:18.680]  I am being persecuted specifically because of my role in exposing the corruption of Bill and Hillary Clinton and Clinton's war on women and the crimes of the Bushes.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:24.583]  It's a two-party vendetta to get me because of my support for Donald Trump.
[00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:27.185]  That's why I'm being harassed.
[00:40:27.225 --> 00:40:33.349]  That's why my Fourth Amendments are being violated as they interrogate my associates.
[00:40:33.369 --> 00:40:34.630]  You've been banned off Twitter.
[00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.191]  They've admittedly hacked into your emails.
[00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:37.912]  Now Skype says you've been banned.
[00:40:39.133 --> 00:40:39.794]  The U.S.
[00:40:39.814 --> 00:40:43.216]  Senate wants every email between Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[00:40:43.256 --> 00:40:45.078]  That's something they've specifically asked for.
[00:40:45.878 --> 00:40:46.839]  And they shall have.
[00:40:47.299 --> 00:40:48.580]  It is all benign.
[00:40:49.361 --> 00:40:50.862]  You'll find no Russian meddling.
[00:40:50.882 --> 00:40:52.263]  You'll find a lot of truth-telling.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.643]  And we'll find, like, here's your plane tickets or, you know, here's that.
[00:40:57.144 --> 00:40:59.226]  But it's such a violation.
[00:40:59.266 --> 00:41:02.410]  What's the name of that great barbecue place again that we're going to?
[00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:03.231]  That kind of thing.
[00:41:03.291 --> 00:41:05.213]  That's actually what's in there, yeah.
[00:41:06.098 --> 00:41:06.698]  Oh my gosh.
[00:41:06.738 --> 00:41:07.479]  All right, Roger.
[00:41:08.039 --> 00:41:08.699]  Thank you so much.
[00:41:08.739 --> 00:41:09.819]  Have a great Fourth of July.
[00:41:09.839 --> 00:41:11.120]  Trump is going to war.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.160]  We're all in a war.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:12.740]  God bless you.
[00:41:13.401 --> 00:41:17.882]  Very special, special news at the War Room tonight.
[00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:22.504]  Assuming that we can solve our problem with Skype.
[00:41:22.604 --> 00:41:28.746]  It's extraordinary the extent to which the Deep State and the tech left is going to harass me.
[00:41:28.846 --> 00:41:34.788]  Alex, all of my Skype platforms closed down today without explanation, which is why I reach you by phone.
[00:41:35.568 --> 00:41:42.391]  Twitter is manipulating the algorithms at the Stone Cold Truth Facebook page, at my personal Facebook page.
[00:41:43.852 --> 00:41:47.854]  I post brilliance and I get back three reposts.
[00:41:47.874 --> 00:41:49.255]  We have the internal documents.
[00:41:49.275 --> 00:41:50.996]  They're doing this to everybody who's affected.
[00:41:51.016 --> 00:41:57.939]  That's why everybody's got to work even harder to, by word of mouth, spread the word about InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:41:58.239 --> 00:42:01.881]  Roger, have a great Fourth, and we'll see you tonight on The War Room, one way or another.
[00:42:02.836 --> 00:42:03.496]  Most excellent.
[00:42:03.577 --> 00:42:04.297]  Many thanks, Alex.
[00:42:04.397 --> 00:42:04.737]  Thank you.
[00:42:04.757 --> 00:42:09.160]  Now, when we come back, Paul wrote a great article with the Inside Intel.
[00:42:09.601 --> 00:42:12.242]  We gave you a kitsch, done one with some points I added.
[00:42:12.943 --> 00:42:15.465]  It's on Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:42:15.505 --> 00:42:17.326]  Please get this out.
[00:42:17.666 --> 00:42:18.507]  This is huge.
[00:42:19.407 --> 00:42:23.090]  Trump threatens to release 9-11 docs implicating Clintons and the Bushes.
[00:42:24.931 --> 00:42:27.292]  Trump sends warning to Deep State.
[00:42:27.453 --> 00:42:30.815]  We should probably just add Mueller, Clintons, Bushes, and their minion Mueller.
[00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:36.573]  This is huge, and it's up on Infowars.com, so get that out to everybody.
[00:42:36.593 --> 00:42:37.474]  Now we're going to go to break.
[00:42:38.535 --> 00:42:44.880]  When we come back, abolish ICE vandals, throw brick through window of GOP offices, leave graffiti message.
[00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:52.966]  More Republicans confronted, and you've got more people being arrested for threatening to kill Rand Paul.
[00:42:53.166 --> 00:42:53.907]  Goodness gracious.
[00:42:54.527 --> 00:42:55.708]  Think about what Rand Paul's gone through.
[00:42:55.728 --> 00:42:58.971]  He's been shot at, a bunch of his ribs broken, physically attacked.
[00:43:00.482 --> 00:43:01.623]  And now this.
[00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.093]  July 4th, 2018 is now here.
[00:43:12.796 --> 00:43:20.884]  240 plus years after we declared our intent to sever our ties with the corrupt King of England.
[00:43:21.704 --> 00:43:30.768]  And I was driving into the Infowars News Center just last week, and it hit me like a thunderbolt, like lightning, that this is the crossroads.
[00:43:32.088 --> 00:43:34.389]  The revolution against the globalists is happening.
[00:43:34.729 --> 00:43:36.690]  Their counter-revolution is taking place.
[00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:43.833]  Antifa and George Soros and the globalists are launching riots and violence and race war and economic war all over the planet.
[00:43:43.853 --> 00:43:45.393]  And it hit me.
[00:43:45.853 --> 00:43:47.954]  This, July 4th, 2018,
[00:43:51.036 --> 00:43:57.020]  Is the binary twin of 1776, metaphysically.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.081]  This is it.
[00:43:58.561 --> 00:44:00.542]  It is the jump point.
[00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:08.808]  It is the point of no return for the tyrants to defeat us or for humanity to struggle free and control its own destiny.
[00:44:09.489 --> 00:44:17.314]  Ladies and gentlemen, everyone from Michael Moore to Bill Maher to Barack Obama, the
[00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:34.961]  Communist organizer are behind the scenes right now and out in the open trying to foment America destroying itself and Europe destroying itself and Latin America destroying itself.
[00:44:34.981 --> 00:44:36.442]  They're trying to pull us apart.
[00:44:36.702 --> 00:44:38.223]  They're trying to block prosperity.
[00:44:39.284 --> 00:44:48.531]  And they're getting more and more and more and more and more desperate as Trump and other nationalist populist leaders on the left and right
[00:44:49.343 --> 00:44:56.586]  From Italy to the US, restore prosperity by simply blocking globalism that is designed to make us poor.
[00:44:57.427 --> 00:44:59.367]  They're trying to create giant monopolies.
[00:44:59.387 --> 00:45:05.570]  They're trying to kill any true free market systems because then they'll have complete and total social control.
[00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:07.271]  So this July 4th, 2018 is so special.
[00:45:10.032 --> 00:45:21.199]  It is the new Declaration of Independence against the globalists, the Declaration of Independence against big tech, the Declaration of Independence against Hollywood, and all these control freaks that lust after controlling our minds.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:35.529]  Despite all the censorship, all the attacks, all the Soros and Hillary funded lawsuits, we are steaming forward, having huge victory, and working with powerful patriots across the world to change human destiny.
[00:45:36.414 --> 00:45:46.343]  That's why this July 4th and for a few days after, for the next week or so, we're offering some of the biggest sales ever on more than 20 items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.665]  We're not funded by megacorporations.
[00:45:48.705 --> 00:45:51.568]  We don't get taxpayer bailouts like MSNBC.
[00:45:51.868 --> 00:45:52.769]  We're funded by you.
[00:45:52.809 --> 00:45:57.674]  We make it easy to support InfoWars because the products are great and they're very, very affordable.
[00:45:58.194 --> 00:46:03.718]  But for the 4th of July, we have some of the biggest sales we've had since Christmas on our best sellers.
[00:46:04.258 --> 00:46:05.899]  I can't list them all, there's more than 20.
[00:46:06.179 --> 00:46:11.423]  But Brain Force, our best-selling nootropic, is 50% off, even though it's close to selling out, free shipping.
[00:46:11.763 --> 00:46:13.805]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen.

[00:46:16.166 --> 00:46:17.067]  That's low in stock.
[00:46:17.747 --> 00:46:19.588]  Knockout, the Sleep Aid.
[00:46:20.188 --> 00:46:20.909]  $17.76 with free shipping.
[00:46:20.949 --> 00:46:22.010]  It's all free shipping.
[00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.292]  It's all 40% to 50% off.
[00:46:25.412 --> 00:46:27.133]  Alexa Pure Breezes, amazing.
[00:46:27.153 --> 00:46:28.774]  $100 off on those.
[00:46:28.814 --> 00:46:31.775]  Storable Foods, 50% off on 3-month supply.
[00:46:32.216 --> 00:46:33.456]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:33.797 --> 00:46:34.837]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:35.037 --> 00:46:37.199]  But whatever you do, go check out all the other specials.
[00:46:37.799 --> 00:46:45.367]  This is how you get great products that make your life better, but also fund the information war against the globalists who we are so close to defeating.
[00:46:45.768 --> 00:46:49.572]  Again, for myself, the entire InfoWars crew and family, you are the InfoWar.
[00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:50.713]  You are the victory.
[00:46:50.733 --> 00:46:51.434]  You're the solution.
[00:46:51.634 --> 00:46:52.535]  You're the reason we're here.
[00:46:52.795 --> 00:46:55.558]  So I commend and thank you all for supporting InfoWars.
[00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:56.719]  Now, God bless you.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.763]  And remember, this Fourth of July is more important than ever.
[00:47:06.343 --> 00:47:09.146]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:09.206 --> 00:47:09.867]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:09.967 --> 00:47:14.311]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:29.243]  We're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:36.929]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I want to open the phones up coming up in the next hour to discuss all the amazing things that are happening.
[00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:53.084]  Then we have several guests joining us who were inside of the riot that the Antifa Democrat globalist operative started in Portland over the weekend that even local newspapers admitted the riot started when Antifa started throwing
[00:47:54.195 --> 00:48:00.358]  Bricks, bottles, and fireworks at the crowd.
[00:48:01.358 --> 00:48:02.698]  And I've seen these explosives.
[00:48:04.199 --> 00:48:09.341]  What they're doing is the mortars that you can shoot out of the big tubes are like hand grenades.
[00:48:10.682 --> 00:48:12.482]  In fact, they are if you put shrapnel around them.
[00:48:12.502 --> 00:48:17.204]  I don't want to give anybody any ideas, but they blow people's hands off all the time.
[00:48:18.145 --> 00:48:20.286]  You know, the mortars that go boom and then shoot out of the tube and...
[00:48:21.596 --> 00:48:27.751]  They have a lot of explosive power to create that huge blue flash, white flash, red flash that you see.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:39.583]  Even in China, where they're not allowed to have firearms and stuff, when you hear about the revolts that happen against the government, people steal the fireworks out of facilities and use those as weapons.
[00:48:40.004 --> 00:48:40.924]  And they are bombs.
[00:48:41.664 --> 00:48:46.646]  And if you watch some of these, these are not normal firecrackers or cherry bombs that are going off, M-80s.
[00:48:47.527 --> 00:48:57.071]  You can see that they are basically throwing larger fireworks at them that are very, very dangerous.
[00:48:57.751 --> 00:48:59.532]  You see the phosphorus shooting out, you name it.
[00:49:01.184 --> 00:49:05.745]  If somebody tries to throw one of those at you, it's my view that's an extremely deadly weapon.
[00:49:06.866 --> 00:49:15.968]  And I guarantee you, if the police see somebody holding a mortar, lighting it and then throwing it, you have no choice but to take those people out.
[00:49:16.889 --> 00:49:19.349]  This is just becoming outrageously insane.
[00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:23.511]  So, those are not M80s like the news said they're throwing at them.
[00:49:23.991 --> 00:49:27.432]  They are mortars that appear to have had the
[00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.889]  We're good to go.
[00:49:44.343 --> 00:49:44.583]  You think?
[00:50:05.612 --> 00:50:07.733]  Back when my dad was a little kid, so he was a highway engineer.
[00:50:07.753 --> 00:50:09.393]  So that's why he had dynamite.
[00:50:09.493 --> 00:50:12.714]  But nowadays, you can't trust Americans with dynamite.
[00:50:12.734 --> 00:50:14.895]  You know, you should never have any attacks with explosives.
[00:50:14.975 --> 00:50:17.756]  And once they make the explosives illegal, then suddenly only the criminals have them.
[00:50:17.776 --> 00:50:19.976]  But I'm digressing off into what happened there.
[00:50:19.996 --> 00:50:21.837]  That's coming up in the third hour.
[00:50:23.418 --> 00:50:24.198]  I've got to reset.
[00:50:24.218 --> 00:50:25.358]  There's so much news here.
[00:50:25.378 --> 00:50:26.378]  I don't even know where to start.
[00:50:27.979 --> 00:50:31.820]  We've got a lot of good news, a lot of bad news, a lot of insane news, a lot of crazy news.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.381]  I cannot express to you
[00:50:38.041 --> 00:50:44.264]  How big this is that Trump is getting ready to start the 9-11 drumbeat and bring out what really happened on 9-11.
[00:50:45.605 --> 00:50:55.370]  That is the thinking behind Tucker Carlson having the guest on, the whole 9-11 situation, the families, Mueller ordering that the investigation be shut down, that the FBI not give that to them in their lawsuit.
[00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:56.631]  That's already on record.
[00:50:57.455 --> 00:50:58.656]  It's been reported on by Mainstream News.
[00:50:58.696 --> 00:51:04.979]  But I've been told that Trump is beginning to then bring it all out using this show.
[00:51:05.599 --> 00:51:07.200]  And they want you to know that.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:12.642]  They want Mueller and all you arrogant SOBs to know that it's all coming out.
[00:51:12.762 --> 00:51:21.686]  Epstein and how you had him as a confidential informant for years while he was loading little girls on airplanes to take them to be raped by a bunch of perverts on his island.
[00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:22.427]  That's all confirmed.
[00:51:23.311 --> 00:51:34.493]  And Mueller, just like Whitey Bulger, could kill whoever he wanted, killed reportedly over 100 people, run mafia operations in Boston, assassinate members of other mafias that the FBI wanted taken out.
[00:51:34.913 --> 00:51:39.194]  The FBI was operating as a gang in Boston.
[00:51:40.674 --> 00:51:42.334]  And it wasn't just a few guys that were involved.
[00:51:42.494 --> 00:51:43.154]  That's all confirmed.
[00:51:43.454 --> 00:51:48.255]  And Mueller ran the cover up and tried to frame the Italian mafia for it.
[00:51:49.296 --> 00:51:50.896]  It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:58.450]  What, the sex offender Epstein only got like a year for all the stuff he did?
[00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.211]  18 months, served like a year of it?
[00:52:01.332 --> 00:52:03.333]  Yeah, he served 13 months of 18 months.
[00:52:03.353 --> 00:52:04.794]  My memory said 12, it was 13 months.
[00:52:05.314 --> 00:52:08.236]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is the guy with 20-plus flights with Bill Clinton.
[00:52:08.656 --> 00:52:11.897]  This is the guy flying to these Sheik's Islands that are known to have sex slaves.
[00:52:12.138 --> 00:52:13.078]  It's been confirmed.
[00:52:13.698 --> 00:52:20.522]  Robert Mueller is a nightmarish demon of the Clintons and the Bushes, who used all of that
[00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:27.872]  Information that they garner with public officials and people going to have sex with 13, 12 year old girls to burn everybody.
[00:52:29.493 --> 00:52:30.333]  And he's a monster.
[00:52:30.393 --> 00:52:31.734]  People are like, well, you better watch out.
[00:52:31.794 --> 00:52:32.574]  Mueller's a criminal.
[00:52:32.654 --> 00:52:33.455]  I know he's a criminal.
[00:52:35.335 --> 00:52:36.916]  I know all about how he operates, man.
[00:52:37.036 --> 00:52:38.717]  Somebody's got to take these guys on.
[00:52:38.737 --> 00:52:41.838]  I don't want to hear, well, you're defiling the FBI.
[00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:42.898]  He's not the FBI.
[00:52:43.539 --> 00:52:46.640]  He's a disgusting nightmare creature.
[00:52:48.137 --> 00:52:49.157]  And he's going down.
[00:52:49.278 --> 00:52:51.839]  Mueller will never politically survive what he's done.
[00:52:52.099 --> 00:52:53.219]  He'll never bring down Trump.
[00:52:53.439 --> 00:52:54.720]  He'll bring nothing down.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.861]  He is a loser.
[00:52:57.001 --> 00:53:07.826]  But an arrogant creature for decades operating and getting away with crime after crime after crime after crime against children, against women, against humanity.
[00:53:09.807 --> 00:53:16.669]  And all the innocent people that Whitey Bulger killed, you know, just choking to death, you know, young women for no reason because they heard something.
[00:53:16.709 --> 00:53:18.790]  I'm just, just a lot of really evil stuff.
[00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:20.170]  That's where, that's where he comes from.
[00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:21.591]  That's what Mueller's into.
[00:53:21.931 --> 00:53:22.811]  He's a thug.
[00:53:23.491 --> 00:53:24.191]  He's a gangster.
[00:53:25.232 --> 00:53:27.893]  But now he's up against history and now he's going to lose.
[00:53:28.973 --> 00:53:29.733]  So that's coming up.
[00:53:29.753 --> 00:53:35.095]  We're going to get into ICE throwing bricks through the window and them assaulting people and
[00:53:36.266 --> 00:53:37.067]  Calling for all of it.
[00:53:37.087 --> 00:53:40.009]  And I've got a lot of good news I'm going to get to that I mentioned as well.
[00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:46.273]  We've got Bono warning that the whole global government's collapsing.
[00:53:46.313 --> 00:53:49.375]  Venezuela further protests as country begins running out of water.
[00:53:50.596 --> 00:53:53.057]  Greenpeace activists crash drone into French nuclear plant.
[00:53:53.578 --> 00:53:55.419]  Bunch of vampire killers on the loose.
[00:53:55.859 --> 00:54:01.003]  Satanist women strangle boyfriend in BDSM sex and chop him up in devil sacrifice.
[00:54:03.803 --> 00:54:05.164]  Just show you the type of folks we're up against.
[00:54:05.204 --> 00:54:06.865]  That's all coming up.
[00:54:08.486 --> 00:54:12.469]  But first off, ladies and gentlemen, it's the 4th of July specials we're running right now.
[00:54:12.489 --> 00:54:19.734]  And I want to thank you all that have been supportive, but these are great products you need, and your funding is absolutely essential.
[00:54:21.485 --> 00:54:25.707]  I'm calling this the 2nd American Revolution 4th of July Super Sale.
[00:54:26.947 --> 00:54:34.210]  And yes, we keep discounting products more and more because as we discount and we sell more, then we're able to buy more at a lower price.
[00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:36.951]  But then it becomes this catch-22 to sell stuff.
[00:54:37.671 --> 00:54:39.752]  I have to always discount it almost down to cost.
[00:54:40.672 --> 00:54:42.232]  So these are really some great deals.
[00:54:43.012 --> 00:54:45.353]  Brain Force Plus, 50% off with free shipping.

[00:54:48.574 --> 00:54:49.354]  That is low stock.
[00:54:49.854 --> 00:54:51.195]  We got a little bit more of the Brain Force in.
[00:54:51.715 --> 00:54:53.035]  Knockout Sleep Formula, $17.76.

[00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:03.758]  Super Mel Vitality, amazing.

[00:55:17.182 --> 00:55:17.442]  That is...
[00:55:19.588 --> 00:55:22.691]  That is 100% lower than anybody else you'll find with that quality.
[00:55:22.711 --> 00:55:24.072]  That is amazing.
[00:55:24.372 --> 00:55:29.017]  The Real Red Pill Plus, now with energy, with the preglanone, the vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, now with energy.
[00:55:29.037 --> 00:55:31.559]  You can get the original without energy or with energy.

[00:55:41.468 --> 00:55:43.069]  With free shipping, that's a huge special.
[00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:52.156]  We're running on the Fluoride Free Toothpaste, 4 to 5 with Chlorosilver Iodine, the Immune Gargle with Chlorosilver Iodine and more, and of course the mouthwash as well with the same thing.
[00:55:52.476 --> 00:55:56.579]  That's all 50% off by itself or individually.
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:59.862]  Alexa Pure Breeze 4-Stage Ion Filter.
[00:56:02.156 --> 00:56:04.800]  At $100 off, it is insane.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.805]  I mean, leading competitors with miniaturization, the prices have gone down from $800 to $500.
[00:56:08.845 --> 00:56:09.526]  At $150, it is bonker cuckoo land.
[00:56:09.546 --> 00:56:10.247]  Good deal.
[00:56:10.267 --> 00:56:10.748]  We're talking the unit
[00:56:17.751 --> 00:56:19.132]  It's costing 80 something dollars.
[00:56:20.714 --> 00:56:24.617]  And then there's all the costs involved distributing everything else.
[00:56:25.198 --> 00:56:27.220]  We're talking about making $45 on it.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:32.244]  If you go buy these anywhere else, they're $500 with a different body on them.
[00:56:33.125 --> 00:56:35.147]  And it's just insane.
[00:56:35.307 --> 00:56:37.189]  I mean, it's just you cannot beat that deal.
[00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:39.871]  Look at the massive amounts of reviews.
[00:56:39.891 --> 00:56:42.354]  4.9 stars on Alexa Peer Bridge.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.821]  And it's all over my office.
[00:56:45.082 --> 00:56:45.983]  It's all over my house.
[00:56:46.343 --> 00:56:49.207]  You know, a big, huge room, you need one filter.
[00:56:49.948 --> 00:56:52.851]  But if you've got a smaller house, one for the back of the house, one on the front of your house.
[00:56:53.232 --> 00:56:55.515]  I've got one in every major room of the office.
[00:56:56.055 --> 00:57:00.601]  And it's got the outside first-stage filter you just clean off whenever the light turns red.
[00:57:01.661 --> 00:57:02.142]  We're good to go.
[00:57:27.045 --> 00:57:29.386]  And without you, we cannot fund this operation.
[00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:31.027]  Without you, the globalists will win.
[00:57:31.067 --> 00:57:32.007]  But they are failing.
[00:57:32.027 --> 00:57:33.148]  They are flagging daily.
[00:57:33.468 --> 00:57:34.869]  But the battle has been joined.
[00:57:34.889 --> 00:57:35.849]  Press the attack.
[00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:36.990]  Press the attack.
[00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:37.970]  Intensify.
[00:57:38.611 --> 00:57:39.371]  Don't look back.
[00:57:39.451 --> 00:57:41.312]  Just swing for the fences, and we will win.
[00:57:41.652 --> 00:57:45.654]  And say a prayer for your family, for America, for the world, for Trump, and for Infowars.
[00:57:46.174 --> 00:57:49.736]  We'll be back with hour number two with a blitzkrieg of critical information.
[00:57:49.796 --> 00:57:50.937]  Please spread the live links.
[00:57:52.688 --> 00:57:59.674]  Every week we're going to be profiling a different TV station, TV network, or cable station or network that's picking up InfoWars.
[00:58:00.094 --> 00:58:06.479]  We're on well over a hundred stations right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:12.964]  Now, one TV station that's actually been picking us up for several years that I want to profile first is Phonoscope.
[00:58:14.045 --> 00:58:20.791]  Phonoscope's creator and owner is the man that invented, more than 50, 60 years ago, streaming
[00:58:21.772 --> 00:58:23.253]  Television over phone lines.
[00:58:23.534 --> 00:58:25.696]  That's why it's called Phonoscope and why it's patented.
[00:58:26.196 --> 00:58:32.061]  Well, he's got several channels and stations in Houston, and he's got us on 24 hours a day.
[00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:37.446]  On Phonoscope, channel 9 in Houston cable systems.
[00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:42.310]  So, we're talking a potential of 6 million people that are able to tune in.
[00:58:42.851 --> 00:58:44.092]  This is very, very exciting.
[00:58:44.172 --> 00:58:47.795]  So, to all of our listeners online, even if you're not in Houston,
[00:58:48.736 --> 00:58:57.664]  Be sure and tell any friends, family, or neighbors, or folks that you know who live in the Houston area, they can tune in to cable channel 9 to Phonoscope.
[00:58:58.024 --> 00:59:09.934]  Not just for my four-hour broadcast every day from our state-of-the-art TV and radio studios here in Austin, but to Owen Schroer, David Knight, and all the other shows, and all the other news, and anchors, and analysis that we're adding.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:13.056]  So, Phonoscope is our oldest TV affiliate.
[00:59:13.797 --> 00:59:17.538]  They've been picking us up, I guess, for four years now, and so we really appreciate them.
[00:59:17.558 --> 00:59:19.598]  They're also one of our biggest, massive response.
[00:59:20.058 --> 00:59:35.842]  So to Lee Cook and the entire family down there at Phonoscope, we salute you, and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show and listeners of my show to tune in to Phonoscope and also visit their website so you can find out about some of the other programs they put out, like Ron Paul's TV show.
[00:59:36.402 --> 00:59:36.742]  So again,
[00:59:37.262 --> 00:59:42.223]  From myself and the entire InfoWars crew in Austin, Texas, we salute Phonoscope in Houston.
[00:59:42.764 --> 00:59:44.264]  Thanks for all you're doing for this republic.
[00:59:44.544 --> 00:59:46.125]  You've helped make America great again.
[00:59:47.585 --> 00:59:51.546]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:56.508 --> 01:00:00.429]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:34.441]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:38.483]  Establishment publications that don't communicate with the general public
[01:00:41.271 --> 01:01:04.364]  But establishment publications that communicate with the governmental and corporate institutions began to develop a plan for a civil emergency using civil unrest, racial strife in America to force Trump out.
[01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:11.372]  And then I saw them, right after Trump got into office, test it out on MSNBC and CNN.
[01:01:11.852 --> 01:01:13.233]  We need a civil emergency.
[01:01:13.273 --> 01:01:14.393]  We need a civil war.
[01:01:14.813 --> 01:01:16.114]  We need to remove Trump.
[01:01:16.154 --> 01:01:17.515]  He's gonna destroy the economy.
[01:01:17.835 --> 01:01:18.875]  He's a Russian agent.
[01:01:18.915 --> 01:01:19.556]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:20.656 --> 01:01:22.257]  So I saw them test running.
[01:01:23.851 --> 01:01:27.072]  So I went on air, and I said, look, they're planning a civil war.
[01:01:27.112 --> 01:01:28.292]  They're planning all this unrest.
[01:01:28.712 --> 01:01:31.113]  They're planning to do more cop-killing, Black Lives Matter.
[01:01:31.533 --> 01:01:33.594]  This is a plan by the globalists to do this.
[01:01:33.974 --> 01:01:40.556]  This is where they're saying, use the 25th Amendment to remove the president during the crisis, extra-judicially, all of it.
[01:01:42.116 --> 01:01:47.578]  And so then I saw George Soros's Media Matters and CNN all make me the main enemy.
[01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:51.768]  And I had a big audience, so we were important, but not that important.
[01:01:52.529 --> 01:02:03.056]  As soon as I began to beat the drum and go, look, they're calling for martial law, they're calling for civil unrest, they're calling for a civil war, they went crazy and would say, Jones is lying!
[01:02:03.116 --> 01:02:04.096]  No one called for that!
[01:02:05.377 --> 01:02:06.918]  Even though I'd show you dozens of articles.
[01:02:08.259 --> 01:02:11.181]  And I'd show you internal emails that had gotten leaked.
[01:02:11.201 --> 01:02:17.886]  The Democrats talking to their constituents and their fundraisers, their donors saying, don't worry, we're going to launch a civil war.
[01:02:19.889 --> 01:02:22.911]  Because they didn't want us to get the jump on them, what they were planning.
[01:02:22.931 --> 01:02:24.812]  If you're launching a sneak attack, you don't want it out there.
[01:02:24.832 --> 01:02:31.836]  But now, in the middle of 2018, already into July, hard to believe.
[01:02:34.059 --> 01:02:36.380]  People are like, oh Alex, you're really telling the truth.
[01:02:37.121 --> 01:02:38.861]  How did you know they were planning civil war?
[01:02:38.901 --> 01:02:51.508]  They're all over HBO and Bill Maher and CNN and MSNBC and ABC News and Michael Moore is everywhere saying surround the Capitol, surround them, uprise, get violent.
[01:02:51.908 --> 01:02:57.691]  No, the idea is, we first have to find ways to stop that vote from happening.
[01:02:57.731 --> 01:02:58.471]  Find ways?
[01:02:58.491 --> 01:02:59.112]  What does that mean?
[01:02:59.972 --> 01:03:04.674]  Well, I'll join a million other people surrounding the United States Capitol.
[01:03:09.537 --> 01:03:10.417]  Bill, let me tell you something.
[01:03:10.697 --> 01:03:16.380]  This judge goes through, for the rest of at least all of our lives, it's a right-wing court.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:16.960]  That's it.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:17.580]  It's over.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.302]  Combined with the White House and the Congress, of course.
[01:03:20.442 --> 01:03:22.723]  Well, yes, and if this is the last American president,
[01:03:23.626 --> 01:03:24.227]  How did you know?
[01:03:24.247 --> 01:03:25.809]  I told you!
[01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:26.970]  I'm not that smart!
[01:03:27.952 --> 01:03:32.077]  They talk about this in their elite publications and then they develop the plan.
[01:03:32.457 --> 01:03:36.502]  They then beta test it with some feelers in the media.
[01:03:39.915 --> 01:03:47.905]  Unfortunately, we've got a situation where, you know, we've got a misogynist, you know, in the White House.
[01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:50.288]  We've got a racist who's also anti-Semitic.
[01:03:50.609 --> 01:03:53.432]  And I know people don't like to, you know, hear those terms thrown around.
[01:03:53.593 --> 01:03:54.434]  Is he really anti-Semitic?
[01:03:54.454 --> 01:03:55.275]  Where did you pick that up?
[01:03:55.695 --> 01:03:58.356]  Yeah, and I'll tell you why.
[01:03:58.376 --> 01:03:59.717]  I'm going to tell you why.
[01:03:59.797 --> 01:04:13.664]  Because it doesn't matter whether you are discriminating against a black person or a Muslim or a Latino or a Jew, if you are comfortable with the fact that there are groups
[01:04:14.264 --> 01:04:29.877]  Who hate Muslims, hate Jews, hate Latinos, hate... If you are comfortable with having those groups support you, and you don't, in a forceful way, say, this is not part of who I am... He's done that, you lying, race-baiting, racist pig!
[01:04:29.897 --> 01:04:39.125]  It's very disturbing to think that the first African-American president... Rob Reiner works for Soros that, of course, actually helped round up Jews for the ghettos.
[01:04:40.282 --> 01:04:43.644]  But, in a way, I understand it because we're fighting the last battle.
[01:04:43.744 --> 01:04:45.645]  Because you're a disgusting race-baiting pig.
[01:04:45.665 --> 01:04:47.946]  Globalism has been about selling America out.
[01:04:48.947 --> 01:05:00.134]  And if you look at all the preparations of Antifa, funded by Soros and the Ford Foundation and others, if you look at everything we're doing, these guys have overthrown Ukraine and caused a civil war.
[01:05:00.174 --> 01:05:00.494]  We'll be back.
[01:05:03.513 --> 01:05:05.434]  This 4th of July is special.
[01:05:05.454 --> 01:05:06.934]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[01:05:07.455 --> 01:05:11.596]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[01:05:11.896 --> 01:05:15.558]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[01:05:16.258 --> 01:05:21.320]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.122]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[01:05:25.962 --> 01:05:27.845]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[01:05:28.245 --> 01:05:30.128]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[01:05:30.208 --> 01:05:33.312]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[01:05:33.352 --> 01:05:40.040]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[01:05:40.501 --> 01:05:42.383]  We have record sales going on right now.
[01:05:43.348 --> 01:05:45.389]  Free shipping on hundreds of different items.
[01:05:45.729 --> 01:05:48.690]  More than 20 items are 50% off, like Brain Force Plus.
[01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:50.491]  X2 is 40% off.
[01:05:50.911 --> 01:05:52.492]  Knockout Sleep Aid, $17.76.
[01:05:53.152 --> 01:05:55.674]  Silver Bullets, $9.95, a little silver.
[01:05:56.414 --> 01:05:58.135]  And free shipping, you can't beat that.
[01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.476]  This Fourth of July is special, and our sales are special to match it.
[01:06:01.696 --> 01:06:02.777]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:06:15.803 --> 01:06:17.967]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:18.428 --> 01:06:20.110]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.932 --> 01:06:24.257]  Alex Jones the man!
[01:06:24.718 --> 01:06:28.123]  What's up, baby?
[01:06:28.163 --> 01:06:28.884]  Ha ha!
[01:06:28.924 --> 01:06:29.786]  This is so silly!
[01:07:02.776 --> 01:07:13.197]  More fun stuff from the crew, because we like having a little bit of fun with my goofier moments here, but when I do get like that, I'm saying I'm alive, I'm not backing down, I'm aware of what you're doing, and we're coming for you.
[01:07:14.258 --> 01:07:16.418]  So, damn the maneuvers, go straight at them.
[01:07:18.015 --> 01:07:19.776]  Let's start this hour with some good news.
[01:07:21.076 --> 01:07:27.258]  The Democrats, the globalists, in every one of their internal publications are running up the white flag, admitting that they're losing.
[01:07:29.399 --> 01:07:42.603]  And they're very upset that the economy and positive thinking and belief in the family is starting to have a little bit of a resurgence, because they know, like fire, that will spread, burning down their tyranny.
[01:07:43.499 --> 01:07:48.861]  It will bring satisfaction, it will bring normalcy, it will bring productivity, it will bring happiness.
[01:07:49.981 --> 01:07:57.444]  The globalists and their corporate disease is designed mental illness to destabilize and control society.
[01:07:58.084 --> 01:07:59.224]  Here's just one of the clips.
[01:07:59.604 --> 01:08:07.087]  Chuck Todd, the Obama-Clinton operative, admits President Trump winning Democrats reeling.
[01:08:07.127 --> 01:08:07.547]  Here it is.
[01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:14.336]  The announced retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy this week helped make one political reality clear.
[01:08:14.476 --> 01:08:17.679]  Despite his overall unpopularity, President Trump is winning.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.182]  And the Democrats right now are reeling.
[01:08:20.983 --> 01:08:21.603]  The Supreme Court.
[01:08:21.924 --> 01:08:26.949]  Mr. Trump is about to shape the court for a generation by choosing a possible tie-breaking conservative justice.
[01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:30.431]  And he's already filled the lower courts with like-minded conservatives.
[01:08:30.911 --> 01:08:31.972]  How about the Republican Party?
[01:08:32.432 --> 01:08:34.753]  The president's approval rating among Republicans is around 90%.
[01:08:35.133 --> 01:08:40.816]  Elected Republicans fear criticizing him, and the party has become a cult of personality.
[01:08:41.037 --> 01:08:41.277]  His.
[01:08:41.297 --> 01:08:43.258]  How about fake news?
[01:08:43.438 --> 01:08:55.945]  Mr. Trump has turned that phrase, which initially referred to the phony Russian-generated stories designed to support his campaign in 2016, into an applause line now to discredit responsible reporting showcasing his misdeeds.
[01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:57.425]  How about credibility?
[01:08:57.786 --> 01:09:02.408]  If reporters faithfully fact-check the president's serial misstatements, they risk being considered biased.
[01:09:02.648 --> 01:09:04.308]  If they don't, the misstatements gain traction.
[01:09:04.328 --> 01:09:06.629]  I was going to do it at the end, but there's just too many lies.
[01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:09.831]  I mean, did you catch how they'll tell the truth but assert a lie?
[01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:18.855]  Despite Trump's overall unfavorability, even in their fake Gallup polls and others that add 15 points more of Democrats, he's at 50%.
[01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:24.065]  So that's not the majority being negative.
[01:09:24.486 --> 01:09:33.513]  And they're also calling people and sampling mainly Democrat areas on record to create that illusion with all these little followers out there that are mad.
[01:09:34.814 --> 01:09:44.482]  And then he goes on to say, oh, despite fake news initially being to expose Russian bots, well, it turns out 80% of those Russian bots, just some company that got hired in Russia, were for Hillary.
[01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:47.845]  And again, it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[01:09:48.723 --> 01:09:54.504]  So he tells the truth overall that Trump's winning, but inserts lies after lie after lie after lie.
[01:09:54.964 --> 01:09:56.405]  The truth is the economy's coming back.
[01:09:56.445 --> 01:09:58.365]  The truth is Trump's hitting on all cylinders.
[01:09:58.385 --> 01:10:01.366]  The truth is you've been caught with your Russiagate thing being a whole hoax.
[01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:07.107]  I saw Bill Clinton on one of those Comedy Central shows last week.
[01:10:07.147 --> 01:10:09.188]  I meant to play it, but he pulled the headline.
[01:10:11.015 --> 01:10:12.296]  I think Trevor Noah is the guy's name.
[01:10:12.956 --> 01:10:17.219]  And he's on there going, I tell you, I think Sarah Huckabee Sanders was really nice.
[01:10:17.439 --> 01:10:18.360]  She paid for a meal.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.181]  She left when she was told to.
[01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:20.761]  That's a good thing.
[01:10:20.941 --> 01:10:22.562]  That makes him sound like a Southern gentleman.
[01:10:23.223 --> 01:10:26.165]  But he goes, you know, that bile, that poison is going to come back.
[01:10:26.745 --> 01:10:30.267]  Trump's vomiting saying all Mexicans are criminals and scum and he hates them.
[01:10:30.287 --> 01:10:35.551]  But when you say all the Mexicans are scum and criminals and you hate them, some of that's going to come back on your people.
[01:10:36.311 --> 01:10:37.352]  So, you know, he caused that.
[01:10:38.311 --> 01:10:41.232]  Trump never said Mexicans are scum or all criminals are bad.
[01:10:41.672 --> 01:10:42.532]  Just a total lie.
[01:10:43.332 --> 01:10:44.653]  Let me just say, I'm a gentleman.
[01:10:44.893 --> 01:10:45.893]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[01:10:46.293 --> 01:10:48.234]  I don't condemn kicking her out of the restaurant, by the way.
[01:10:48.834 --> 01:10:50.995]  I'm just saying, she politely even paid for her meal.
[01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:52.415]  And she left.
[01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:53.075]  That's good.
[01:10:53.715 --> 01:10:54.576]  Get your ass out of here.
[01:10:55.176 --> 01:11:00.577]  But the point is, you deserve it because of the poison that Trump spewed out.
[01:11:00.897 --> 01:11:02.538]  Some of that poison is going to come back up.
[01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:03.118]  That's the quote.
[01:11:04.718 --> 01:11:06.619]  Some of that poison is going to come back up on you.
[01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:12.858]  See, but Trump didn't say that, but see, by making it sound like he's being congenial and a nice headline.
[01:11:12.878 --> 01:11:15.661]  Oh, look, I don't like what happened to her.
[01:11:15.701 --> 01:11:17.704]  Well, actually, she did deserve it.
[01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.209]  But that's how I do it.
[01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:21.869]  That's how I run the things around here.
[01:11:21.889 --> 01:11:23.950]  It's really nice to be able to lie to people like that.
[01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:25.431]  Let's go back to old Toddy.
[01:11:25.471 --> 01:11:25.971]  Here he is.
[01:11:26.651 --> 01:11:28.272]  Either way, Mr. Trump wins.
[01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:29.993]  The Mueller investigation.
[01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:37.476]  The president has succeeded in convincing millions that the investigation is biased, despite trafficking only in innuendo.
[01:11:37.856 --> 01:11:38.777]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[01:11:39.137 --> 01:11:43.659]  Trafficking only in innuendo because Chuck Todd reading off a teleprompter said so.
[01:11:44.636 --> 01:11:48.558]  They've caught him in the Strzok emails, the Page emails, the McCabe emails.
[01:11:48.878 --> 01:11:50.198]  We gotta keep him from getting in.
[01:11:50.238 --> 01:11:51.039]  We're gonna stop him.
[01:11:51.059 --> 01:11:51.779]  We're gonna fix it.
[01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:52.939]  Insurance policies.
[01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:55.180]  Millions of dollars for the fake Fusion GPS.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.381]  Mueller breaking all the rules.
[01:11:56.601 --> 01:11:57.621]  The thing going on and on.
[01:11:57.701 --> 01:11:59.242]  Rosenstein controlling the whole deal.
[01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:05.765]  Comey and Strzok covering up for Hillary on the server gate and Benghazi and Russia gate.
[01:12:06.825 --> 01:12:10.727]  But meanwhile, Chuck Todd says, oh, he's succeeded.
[01:12:13.158 --> 01:12:18.521]  In despite the fact there's no evidence that anybody colluded to frame him that we did.
[01:12:18.621 --> 01:12:20.642]  No, you've been caught red-handed.
[01:12:20.702 --> 01:12:21.163]  Continue.
[01:12:22.984 --> 01:12:23.704]  Mr. Trump wins.
[01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:25.405]  The Mueller investigation.
[01:12:25.665 --> 01:12:32.309]  The president has succeeded in convincing millions that the investigation is biased despite trafficking only in innuendo and not providing evidence.
[01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:33.890]  Then there's the economy.
[01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:34.610]  It is doing well.
[01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:36.371]  But it was doing well before he took office.
[01:12:37.432 --> 01:12:37.512]  Yeah.
[01:12:37.532 --> 01:12:38.032]  There's a magic wand.
[01:12:38.052 --> 01:12:38.813]  Hoping we're stupid.
[01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:39.614]  Hoping we're gullible.
[01:12:39.634 --> 01:12:39.894]  Here it is.
[01:12:58.527 --> 01:13:04.691]  It was doing well before he took office, yet with unemployment down and jobs being created, President Trump is getting this credit.
[01:13:04.851 --> 01:13:07.333]  Still, much of Mr. Trump's success is superficial.
[01:13:07.733 --> 01:13:10.575]  While he's more popular among Republicans, the party overall is shrinking.
[01:13:10.976 --> 01:13:18.021]  His trade war, North Korea, or the Mueller investigation all could turn against him and frankly could turn against him now like North Korea has.
[01:13:19.551 --> 01:13:26.012]  And they're cheerleading that North Korea hasn't done everything it said it would do, but they've never even agreed on the new timetable.
[01:13:26.492 --> 01:13:27.993]  And so Pompeo's rushing out there.
[01:13:28.193 --> 01:13:30.073]  We're trying to take North Korea away from China.
[01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:31.593]  They're putting pressure on them.
[01:13:31.834 --> 01:13:34.234]  This is a real tug of war to get them to come out of the dark.
[01:13:34.594 --> 01:13:36.334]  China's been keeping them in that bad position.
[01:13:36.374 --> 01:13:37.395]  That's coming up later.
[01:13:37.415 --> 01:13:38.215]  I'm going to break that down.
[01:13:38.255 --> 01:13:40.395]  But Trump's trying to go get peace.
[01:13:40.675 --> 01:13:42.036]  Trump's trying to fix things.
[01:13:42.316 --> 01:13:43.696]  Something you guys never did.
[01:13:45.131 --> 01:13:48.033]  And then Chuck Todd sits up there, bad-mouthing everything.
[01:13:48.093 --> 01:13:48.653]  It's incredible.
[01:13:49.034 --> 01:13:51.575]  Meanwhile, the Republican Party's growing.
[01:13:51.695 --> 01:13:52.316]  It's populist.
[01:13:52.336 --> 01:13:53.036]  We're taking it over.
[01:13:53.336 --> 01:13:57.459]  It's getting more gubernatorial seats, more statehouse seats, more federal seats.
[01:13:58.059 --> 01:14:04.123]  The Democratic Party is a bizarro, elitist, coastal party.
[01:14:05.924 --> 01:14:12.729]  Its only hope is to bring in dumbed-down, third-world populations that are on their payroll.
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:22.950]  So again, that's just Chuck Todd trying to hold the line, hold the forces during collapse, make everybody think that they've got a shot from coming back from the dead and betting against the U.S.
[01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:25.052]  economy, saying it could turn, it could turn any moment.
[01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:25.893]  It's superficial.
[01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:27.034]  America isn't strong.
[01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:28.295]  By the way, I'm Chuck Todd.
[01:14:28.315 --> 01:14:28.996]  I love America.
[01:14:29.016 --> 01:14:29.837]  Remember CNN?
[01:14:30.237 --> 01:14:31.498]  We don't hate America.
[01:14:31.518 --> 01:14:32.219]  We love America.
[01:14:32.259 --> 01:14:33.060]  We don't hate Americans.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:33.781]  We love Americans.
[01:14:35.214 --> 01:14:35.855]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:36.956 --> 01:14:41.581]  Bono warns that existence of UN, EU and NATO are threatened.
[01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:45.066]  Well, the UN's a big criminal body with a horrible, wicked record.
[01:14:46.283 --> 01:14:49.744]  It's civil human rights commissions run by a bunch of dictators and mass murderers.
[01:14:49.804 --> 01:14:50.704]  It's literally a joke.
[01:14:51.204 --> 01:14:53.685]  The EU was created after a Nazi plan.
[01:14:53.705 --> 01:14:55.445]  It has an unelected bureaucracy that runs it.
[01:14:56.046 --> 01:14:59.286]  NATO's completely out of control, drug dealing, child sex trafficking.
[01:14:59.627 --> 01:15:00.767]  And he says they're all threatened.
[01:15:00.787 --> 01:15:10.629]  And Bono's the little UN guy who goes out and says, save it, who gives less than 1% of the money he raises, billions of dollars, $3 billion he's raised, for African aid.
[01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:11.410]  He keeps 99%.
[01:15:14.475 --> 01:15:17.476]  Talk about a monster pig creature.
[01:15:18.157 --> 01:15:22.898]  Meanwhile, Venezuela further protests as country begins running out of water.
[01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.419]  I'm going to get more into that.
[01:15:24.559 --> 01:15:28.661]  Brian Ross leaving ABC after lying about General Flynn and saying he was a Russian agent.
[01:15:29.261 --> 01:15:34.643]  We've got Archbishop condemned for cover up a pedophile is now in hiding.
[01:15:35.784 --> 01:15:37.384]  Yeah, I think the rats are in trouble.
[01:15:37.764 --> 01:15:39.385]  The rats that have hijacked the Catholic Church.
[01:15:39.405 --> 01:15:40.966]  The rats that have hijacked the FBI.
[01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:47.961]  The rats that have hijacked almost everything in this society, we're aware of it now and understand what's happening.
[01:15:48.241 --> 01:15:52.783]  So it's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:15:53.223 --> 01:15:56.745]  Please stay with us and please share the fact of where you're listening and how you're listening.
[01:15:56.905 --> 01:15:58.605]  That's critical to get around the censors.
[01:15:58.945 --> 01:16:00.646]  That is how we win, thanks to you.
[01:16:07.228 --> 01:16:08.369]  Where are you right now, Millie?
[01:16:09.281 --> 01:16:12.684]  Well, right now I'm in San Diego, California, back at my hotel.
[01:16:12.984 --> 01:16:21.011]  But yesterday we were down in Tijuana, Mexico, right on the Mexican side of the border, speaking with the migrant caravan.
[01:16:21.071 --> 01:16:27.417]  I wanted to go down there and investigate and find out exactly what is going on with this migrant caravan situation.
[01:16:27.797 --> 01:16:36.925]  And I'll tell you, the liberal media is out there saying that these are all refugees that are in immediate need for safety and protection inside the United States.
[01:16:37.405 --> 01:16:43.610]  What I can tell you is that what I found out from the migrants themselves is that that is actually not true.
[01:16:43.991 --> 01:16:55.820]  And so we spoke to some of the locals out here in Mexico and what they say is that they have a greater chance of getting through under refugee or asylum status if they have children with them.
[01:16:56.841 --> 01:17:05.569]  Human trafficking is associated with this caravan and they tend to bring children because it increases their odds of getting into the United States.
[01:17:05.889 --> 01:17:10.092]  But this is all about just getting into the United States to work in the U.S.
[01:17:10.433 --> 01:17:16.878]  in order to bring money back to their families or back to their cartels or get cartel members in to smuggle drugs.
[01:17:16.938 --> 01:17:19.480]  There's a culture of drugs in Mexico.
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.221]  I would say that
[01:17:20.481 --> 01:17:24.963]  You know, the people in the caravan were no safer than the whole entire rest of the country, Mexico.
[01:17:25.223 --> 01:17:32.766]  But Mexico is almost like a third world country and many other countries across, you know, the whole globe are in this same situation.
[01:17:32.826 --> 01:17:41.349]  So we can't say that, hey, these are people in immediate need for help and they need to get in or because their safety is compromised, because that's just simply not the case.
[01:17:41.409 --> 01:17:44.731]  And if it were, you would have billions of people coming to the U.S.
[01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:46.431]  and we just can't do that.
[01:17:46.751 --> 01:17:47.832]  It would collapse our system.
[01:17:48.192 --> 01:17:50.455]  And that's exactly what the globalists want to do.
[01:17:50.475 --> 01:17:56.922]  Now the globalists would like America to be run exactly how Mexico is run.
[01:17:56.962 --> 01:17:59.665]  They actually have a maximum wage in Mexico.
[01:18:00.026 --> 01:18:01.487]  You cannot get paid over $1.75 in Mexico.
[01:18:03.049 --> 01:18:07.652]  So they're getting paid such low wages, they want to come, you know, get a U.S.
[01:18:07.732 --> 01:18:23.523]  passport or visa or citizenship to commute across the border, work in San Diego, work in, you know, American countries, and then commute back to their homes in Mexico, or just live in America and send their money back to their families.
[01:18:23.923 --> 01:18:27.686]  So that's essentially what these people were expressing what they wanted to do.
[01:18:27.706 --> 01:18:29.467]  It's essentially a business model.
[01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:31.109]  It's for financial gain.
[01:18:31.329 --> 01:18:32.610]  None of them were refugees.
[01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:37.133]  None of them felt like they were in any immediate danger or fear.
[01:18:37.493 --> 01:18:47.221]  They were being taken care of better than most of the other citizens in Mexico because they had all of these Democrat NGOs, American organizations, coming out and feeding them.
[01:18:47.621 --> 01:18:49.202]  So these people were perfectly fine.
[01:18:49.242 --> 01:18:51.384]  They had already been given refuge in Mexico.
[01:18:51.844 --> 01:18:57.111]  So for the liberal media to claim these are refugees that need immediate help, it's just absolutely not true.
[01:18:57.131 --> 01:18:58.253]  It's a lie.
[01:19:02.378 --> 01:19:06.722]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:19:07.222 --> 01:19:16.130]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:21.254]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:20:06.526 --> 01:20:19.995]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:22.517]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:20:22.537 --> 01:20:23.898]  We love the American people.
[01:20:35.103 --> 01:20:37.305]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:20:37.325 --> 01:20:38.806]  We love the American people.
[01:20:38.826 --> 01:20:41.948]  We love the American people.
[01:20:42.208 --> 01:20:43.710]  We love the American people.
[01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:57.920]  They came in peace.
[01:20:58.501 --> 01:21:00.682]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:21:00.702 --> 01:21:02.083]  We love the American people.
[01:21:09.896 --> 01:21:11.117]  This is CNN.
[01:21:11.137 --> 01:21:20.962]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:21:21.082 --> 01:21:30.567]  A lot of poison has been poured down America's throat since that 2016 campaign started.
[01:21:30.647 --> 01:21:33.189]  It started off calling Mexicans rapists and murderers.
[01:21:33.689 --> 01:21:39.012]  So it's hard to pour poison down other people's throat and not have some of it come back up and bubble up.
[01:21:39.778 --> 01:21:44.561]  Cut to Ryer, yay!
[01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:47.422]  Incredible, isn't it?
[01:21:50.224 --> 01:21:51.404]  Now, shifting gears.
[01:21:51.845 --> 01:21:54.026]  Maxine Waters has raised the battle cry.
[01:21:54.226 --> 01:21:55.907]  Michael Moore has raised the battle cry.
[01:21:57.068 --> 01:22:08.034]  You've got all these people getting arrested for going out and saying, kill Rand Paul, murder his children, murder his wife, rub their intestines all over the walls in a helter-skelter type killing.
[01:22:08.973 --> 01:22:10.333]  That's all coming up in this segment.
[01:22:10.353 --> 01:22:11.153]  I'll be breaking it down.
[01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:16.855]  But I thought we'd kick it off first with a reminder of Mad Maxine in her latest speech.
[01:22:16.895 --> 01:22:18.515]  Says, we are sick and tired of Trump.
[01:22:18.915 --> 01:22:20.035]  He's been there too long.
[01:22:20.155 --> 01:22:20.575]  Impeach 45.
[01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:23.476]  Yeah, because you didn't like the election.
[01:22:24.296 --> 01:22:25.797]  You don't like the economy coming back.
[01:22:25.817 --> 01:22:27.817]  That your boot on our necks being removed.
[01:22:28.197 --> 01:22:34.478]  And you can see your corrupt power dwaning and your party disappearing.
[01:22:36.479 --> 01:22:37.239]  And that's what's happening.
[01:22:38.137 --> 01:22:39.858]  You can see all of it disappearing.
[01:22:39.878 --> 01:22:41.860]  You can see it running through your fingers.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.621]  So here is Mad Max.
[01:22:44.702 --> 01:22:49.445]  I am not about to let this country go by the way of Donald Trump.
[01:22:50.026 --> 01:22:52.067]  We are sick and tired of him.
[01:22:52.348 --> 01:22:53.689]  He's been there too long.
[01:22:53.949 --> 01:22:55.810]  They dare me to say impeach him.
[01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:57.531]  Today I say impeach 45!
[01:23:04.888 --> 01:23:10.395]  Today I say Donald Trump, this is not your country to do with whatever you want to do.
[01:23:10.756 --> 01:23:12.598]  This country belongs to all of us!
[01:23:14.474 --> 01:23:36.132]  And the Supreme Court upheld five countries that don't even have working airports, where the Imams give them passports, and then occasional charter flights fly out, and then unvetted people from Libya, Somalia, Sudan, where they sell humans in slave markets, where women, unattended, are kidnapped in minutes and gang-raped.
[01:23:39.154 --> 01:23:40.635]  And then she's calling that bad.
[01:23:41.035 --> 01:23:43.838]  Just like Bill Clinton says that
[01:23:44.778 --> 01:23:48.679]  Trump says he hates Mexicans and that Mexicans are criminals.
[01:23:49.319 --> 01:23:52.900]  No, he said we have an open border with a lot of criminals pouring across back and forth.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:53.500]  It's dangerous.
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:57.301]  So again, they just regurgitate that lie over and over again.
[01:23:58.421 --> 01:23:59.842]  Let's go ahead and go to this.
[01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:09.664]  Scott Pruitt becomes latest Trump official to be harassed at a restaurant with the fake sanctimonious angry woman with her kid in his face like he's done something bad.
[01:24:10.464 --> 01:24:16.008]  Then we've got abolish ice vandals, throw brick through window of GOP office, leave graffiti message.
[01:24:16.708 --> 01:24:18.109]  Here is the latest video.
[01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.870]  So there you go.
[01:24:38.843 --> 01:24:41.645]  Again, America's having its carbon cut off to bankrupt us.
[01:24:41.705 --> 01:24:44.247]  China has no carbon restrictions, neither does India or Mexico.
[01:24:44.527 --> 01:24:53.933]  This is an admitted plan to bankrupt us and pay Al Gore, the Rothschilds, and Soros trillions of dollars if they ever got their carbon tax, but that's going up in flame as well.
[01:24:54.234 --> 01:24:57.316]  There's the Nebraska Republican Party had the old brick thrown through.
[01:24:58.016 --> 01:25:00.098]  Abolish ICE, and that's the Democrats' big
[01:25:01.761 --> 01:25:02.463]  Mantra now.
[01:25:03.545 --> 01:25:09.878]  Meanwhile, we have Jennifer Rubin says Sarah Sanders needs a life sentence of being made uncomfortable.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.002]  Well, you know what's gonna happen.
[01:25:13.021 --> 01:25:20.347]  In major studies, it varies from country to country, but it's normally six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely not to give to charity.
[01:25:20.647 --> 01:25:32.396]  Just type in liberals are more mentally ill, liberals are more psychotic, liberals are less likely to give to charity, liberals are less likely to keep a job, liberals are more likely to steal.
[01:25:32.797 --> 01:25:36.340]  There are studies in Canada, Australia, corporations all know this.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:44.872]  They're virtue signaling snot-nosed control freaks who live to rule everyone else and get in everyone else's business.
[01:25:45.633 --> 01:25:46.334]  That's what they do.
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:52.981]  And most of your psychologists in this country now are Democrat priesthood who just replaced confession.
[01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:58.963]  And all they do is work around the clock to break up families and destroy this country in many cases.
[01:25:59.383 --> 01:26:00.663]  It's unbelievable.
[01:26:00.983 --> 01:26:03.364]  It's not in all cases, but that's what's going on.
[01:26:03.484 --> 01:26:04.624]  And it's being exposed.
[01:26:04.964 --> 01:26:07.585]  People are figuring out that there is a cult of control freaks.
[01:26:07.945 --> 01:26:15.827]  I've done a survey and looked at it, and you know what the most popular, they got TV shows about it now, the most popular thing with the average Democrat now is Alistair Crowley.
[01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:43.793]  And you look at the WikiLeaks, and you look at the Podestas, and you look at Ravamovich, and all these people is, they are into the occult, they are little magic-thinking Harry Potter fans, and they graduate to Aleister Crowley, and they are falling apart, they are losers, they are failures looking for power instead of just being good, and realizing God's there, and that is the power, and that you were already ascended if you loved God.
[01:26:45.452 --> 01:26:51.916]  But instead they always die in a big pile of their own feces and total failure like Aleister Crowley and other delusional fruitball.
[01:26:52.917 --> 01:26:55.239]  So let's continue with Jennifer Rubin.
[01:26:55.259 --> 01:26:55.559]  Here it is.
[01:26:56.857 --> 01:27:01.020]  What's most successful is getting a million people on the street to protest.
[01:27:17.273 --> 01:27:17.913]  That's their plan.
[01:27:18.173 --> 01:27:20.074]  The left in their own documents say, we don't do it.
[01:27:20.114 --> 01:27:20.774]  We wear masks.
[01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:26.077]  The white people, the professors, they go out and burn some stuff, get it started, and then hope they can get black folks too.
[01:27:26.117 --> 01:27:28.518]  That's in the documents that are up on Infowars.com.
[01:27:28.558 --> 01:27:29.038]  Let's continue.
[01:27:29.721 --> 01:27:34.203]  But what's most successful is getting a million people on the street to protest.
[01:27:34.603 --> 01:27:40.406]  So let's redirect all of that good pent-up energy to something that makes a difference.
[01:27:40.446 --> 01:27:46.708]  Let's get a million people to go to Maine or a million people to go to Alaska and start putting pressure on those senators.
[01:27:48.209 --> 01:27:49.630]  Perfectly civil to do that.
[01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:52.111]  No one's telling them to be violent protesters.
[01:27:52.511 --> 01:27:55.172]  But we're not going to let these people go through life unscathed.
[01:27:55.412 --> 01:28:03.135]  Sarah Huckabee has no right to live a life of no fuss, no muss, after lying to the press, after inciting against the press.
[01:28:03.516 --> 01:28:07.517]  These people should be made uncomfortable, and I think that's a life sentence, frankly.
[01:28:08.638 --> 01:28:11.039]  Look how mentally ill all those Democrats look.
[01:28:11.826 --> 01:28:14.808]  Look, if you're watching on TV, they're kind of all looking off in the distance.
[01:28:14.848 --> 01:28:15.408]  They always are.
[01:28:15.769 --> 01:28:16.449]  They got tics.
[01:28:16.489 --> 01:28:18.310]  They're all just, they're weak, stupid people.
[01:28:18.911 --> 01:28:26.356]  And they've been bred and contained and put up on pedestals and given their participation trophies.
[01:28:26.456 --> 01:28:30.398]  And now they are at war with prosperity and capitalism.
[01:28:30.458 --> 01:28:41.766]  And they are the biggest dukes of the megabanks and the trillionaire companies and the people worth hundreds of billions that pay no tax, that literally fund them and then run slave factories with suicide nets and forced abortion.
[01:28:41.766 --> 01:28:43.607]  Yeah, it's horrible!
[01:29:02.568 --> 01:29:04.329]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[01:30:04.949 --> 01:30:09.052]  What you're about to see are two presidents of the teachers union.
[01:30:09.173 --> 01:30:11.875]  One guy named Dave Perry in Trenton, New Jersey.
[01:30:11.915 --> 01:30:15.258]  Another named Kathleen Valencia in Union City, New Jersey.
[01:30:15.718 --> 01:30:19.401]  And they're talking about covering up child abusers in the public schools.
[01:30:20.082 --> 01:30:22.664]  Dave Perry, the statements he makes are so shocking.
[01:30:22.724 --> 01:30:26.347]  He actually says, we want to turn it back around onto the child.
[01:30:26.387 --> 01:30:27.408]  He says, it's my job.
[01:30:28.008 --> 01:30:29.570]  He says I'm gonna backdate it.
[01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:32.412]  That's commit fraud after the incident of abuse.
[01:30:32.872 --> 01:30:34.854]  He says that's his job at the teachers union.
[01:30:34.874 --> 01:30:36.915]  He's there to protect the worst people.
[01:30:37.416 --> 01:30:40.779]  He's there to bend the truth and he's there to reverse it back onto the kid.
[01:30:40.799 --> 01:30:44.782]  There's me confronting Dave Perry who denied the things he said.
[01:30:44.842 --> 01:30:45.903]  Now last night Alex
[01:30:46.783 --> 01:30:53.449]  The National Education Association and the NJEA, that's the New Jersey version of it, has suspended him.
[01:30:53.529 --> 01:31:02.076]  So they've suspended one union president and then just today, Alex, we released another woman in New Jersey saying that she was protecting child abuse.
[01:31:02.136 --> 01:31:03.697]  But I don't want him coming here with a bunch of lies.
[01:31:03.737 --> 01:31:06.079]  I need to know the truth so that we can bend the truth.
[01:31:06.819 --> 01:31:07.320]  Okay.
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:10.602]  Well yeah, I mean it was like a physical... Yeah, like a physical skirmish.
[01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:25.714]  I'm going to date it back to the day after the incident.
[01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:27.175]  Okay.
[01:31:27.756 --> 01:31:28.437]  He was worried.
[01:31:28.797 --> 01:31:29.859]  He did shake the kid.
[01:31:30.099 --> 01:31:32.281]  So if they said there was bruises he had, there was bruises where?
[01:31:32.342 --> 01:31:35.225]  I got to ask him where he hit him.
[01:31:35.265 --> 01:31:37.828]  Because he was trying to put him back in his seat because he was getting physical.
[01:31:38.289 --> 01:31:40.551]  We reversed it onto the kid.
[01:31:41.232 --> 01:31:41.692]  Okay, yeah.
[01:31:41.712 --> 01:31:42.393]  That's my job.
[01:31:42.653 --> 01:31:46.095]  It's not a good job, but it's my job and what I have to do.
[01:31:46.115 --> 01:31:51.578]  This file right here is from a teacher who had sex with a student.
[01:31:52.559 --> 01:31:52.959]  Okay?
[01:31:53.039 --> 01:31:54.100]  You're not going to jail.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.762]  You know what this whole file is about?
[01:31:58.402 --> 01:32:01.224]  It's about whether or not they get to keep their pension.
[01:32:01.804 --> 01:32:02.204]  Okay.
[01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:07.307]  The sex with a teenage girl.
[01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:08.968]  Oh, yeah.
[01:32:09.209 --> 01:32:09.769]  Is he going to jail?
[01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.810]  No.
[01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:15.171]  I'm being as brutally honest with you as I can.
[01:32:15.992 --> 01:32:24.496]  If you are afraid of a middle school child who called you a d*** and spit on you and advanced towards you, you are in the wrong profession.
[01:32:24.516 --> 01:32:25.156]  Kid's fine.
[01:32:26.077 --> 01:32:26.637]  Kid's not hurt.
[01:32:27.017 --> 01:32:27.958]  He got a scratch.
[01:32:28.798 --> 01:32:29.939]  He's gonna give the kid a 65, right?
[01:32:32.532 --> 01:32:34.253]  He's not gonna fail the kid?
[01:32:34.313 --> 01:32:34.733]  No, no.
[01:32:34.773 --> 01:32:36.314]  No, he's not gonna fail the kid?
[01:32:36.934 --> 01:32:42.076]  He's gonna get that kid out of this f***ing classroom and move on fresh for September.
[01:32:42.656 --> 01:32:44.837]  We're facing a crisis in American education.
[01:32:45.057 --> 01:32:47.578]  And this week, the NJEA is under fire.
[01:32:48.058 --> 01:32:51.039]  Teachers unions would have you believe that they're fighting for our children.
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:57.322]  But the evidence in these tapes show they're fighting for themselves, their survival, and their own dominance.
[01:33:05.757 --> 01:33:08.399]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:29.341 --> 01:33:38.144]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:46.388 --> 01:33:54.631]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a wolverine.
[01:34:04.231 --> 01:34:08.633]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:34:09.253 --> 01:34:12.835]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:34:13.255 --> 01:34:14.856]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:34:15.336 --> 01:34:16.977]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:34:17.537 --> 01:34:19.258]  John has a long mustache.
[01:34:19.538 --> 01:34:21.179]  John has a long mustache.
[01:34:21.579 --> 01:34:24.300]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.542]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:34:34.455 --> 01:34:35.876]  But they took a lot of people away.
[01:34:36.336 --> 01:34:38.238]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[01:34:38.458 --> 01:34:41.060]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:41.920]  Where?
[01:34:43.041 --> 01:34:44.882]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[01:34:45.122 --> 01:34:53.088]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:34:53.348 --> 01:34:57.251]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:07.473]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[01:35:07.953 --> 01:35:14.720]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:18.784]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:35:18.824 --> 01:35:19.865]  would you see that happening?
[01:35:19.925 --> 01:35:23.929]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:35:24.509 --> 01:35:32.813]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:35:34.454 --> 01:35:40.317]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:35:40.457 --> 01:35:45.019]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[01:35:51.789 --> 01:35:54.131]  That's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[01:35:54.351 --> 01:35:58.435]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:35:59.416 --> 01:36:00.436]  Put your gun down, really?
[01:36:02.618 --> 01:36:07.042]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:36:07.602 --> 01:36:09.124]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:36:09.444 --> 01:36:11.406]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:36:14.111 --> 01:36:19.180]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.944]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[01:36:22.445 --> 01:36:26.331]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:36:40.419 --> 01:37:01.855]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a wolverine We're back live ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us I'm gonna take some phone calls coming up the next segment and right through into the next hour The toll-free number to join us on this day before
[01:37:02.858 --> 01:37:10.765]  The 4th of July-level broadcast, July 3rd, 2018, is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:37:10.785 --> 01:37:11.085]  877-789-2539.
[01:37:11.205 --> 01:37:20.534]  And we will get you up and on the air to talk about all the huge news that's breaking, all the big developments.
[01:37:20.574 --> 01:37:22.155]  What do you make of what I covered first hour?
[01:37:22.876 --> 01:37:27.120]  That Trump is preparing to start releasing 9-11 information about the stand-down?
[01:37:28.959 --> 01:37:31.000]  About Robert Mueller and the cover-up, all of it.
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:36.281]  That's an exclusive to Infowars.com from high-level sources.
[01:37:37.922 --> 01:37:39.662]  And we get into the opening salvos of that.
[01:37:39.722 --> 01:37:40.943]  It's a big, big deal.
[01:37:41.343 --> 01:37:44.264]  Now, let me hit something really critical.
[01:37:46.384 --> 01:37:52.126]  If you try to watch any major Netflix movie, or you try to go to the movie theater, or you try to just go online,
[01:37:53.635 --> 01:37:59.896]  Almost every major storyline, movie, you name it, has evil white people hurting black people.
[01:38:00.477 --> 01:38:08.018]  And they're making hundreds of movies the last few years where it's just saturated everywhere about injustices in the past.
[01:38:09.379 --> 01:38:18.881]  The newest movie is The Purge, the first Purge, where it shows the army and a Trumpian-like future with Van Jones in the movie.
[01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:26.733]  With the army wearing KKK uniforms coming out and killing black people and their children.
[01:38:27.273 --> 01:38:32.096]  This is all a simulation to create the idea that this is happening.
[01:38:32.116 --> 01:38:41.662]  If you read the documents we got in January from 2015, where the Soros group was trying to create civil war and race war to bring in martial law.
[01:38:42.706 --> 01:39:04.211]  And it's their own documents where they're setting it up, it's their own documents where they're doing it, where they're in Maryland, in Baltimore, and other blue city areas, working with local police to stage attacks, burn this, attack that, it's why it's always stylized, turn over a dumpster, burn a trash can, knock out some corporate
[01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:06.009]  I don't
[01:39:24.093 --> 01:39:24.873]  Want anybody looking?
[01:39:24.913 --> 01:39:26.994]  This is criminal racketeering, in my view.
[01:39:27.034 --> 01:39:28.675]  We need indictments by the Justice Department.
[01:39:29.035 --> 01:39:30.776]  This is Soros' son running all this.
[01:39:30.816 --> 01:39:32.337]  This is unbelievable.
[01:39:32.397 --> 01:39:35.278]  And they sign on to it, their action plan, everything.
[01:39:36.559 --> 01:39:40.140]  And so when you see the massive level of brainwashing, you know what they're trying to do.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:42.021]  They're trying to get a Charlottesville-type event going.
[01:39:42.041 --> 01:39:44.662]  They're trying to get normal anti-Trump crowds out.
[01:39:45.683 --> 01:39:52.326]  Then they're trying to have some white supremacist or white supremacist-like-type groups come that are obviously led by the globalists that's even come out.
[01:39:53.393 --> 01:39:59.157]  To then have the clash and then blame it on Trump and America to create an explosion in this country.
[01:40:00.218 --> 01:40:05.762]  And the removal of the Confederate statues and all of this that people just wander by and don't even care about.
[01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:08.104]  It's all just done to create a tinderbox.
[01:40:08.484 --> 01:40:09.605]  And you can see it in the news.
[01:40:09.645 --> 01:40:11.927]  They're hyping it, they're hyping it, they're hyping it, they're hyping it.
[01:40:13.047 --> 01:40:18.992]  Now, when we come back, before I go to your calls, what are they really hyping other than that, even bigger than race war?
[01:40:20.776 --> 01:40:22.718]  This just went up on InfoWars.com.
[01:40:22.818 --> 01:40:23.558]  It's an exclusive.
[01:40:23.598 --> 01:40:24.799]  Nobody else has picked this up.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.501]  Dragtots.
[01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:28.743]  Cartoon sparks outrage.
[01:40:29.243 --> 01:40:32.145]  Baby drag queen cartoon marketed to young children.
[01:40:32.686 --> 01:40:35.948]  And again, we've gone to... In fact, it's back there in the producer's office.
[01:40:36.849 --> 01:40:37.510]  We've gone to...
[01:40:39.087 --> 01:40:39.247]  It's
[01:41:00.147 --> 01:41:06.972]  Going in when they're 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 years old and showing them this and confusing them is designed to create mental illness.
[01:41:07.273 --> 01:41:11.236]  And Camille Paglia is a classical liberal and a lesbian and she'll tell you that.
[01:41:11.616 --> 01:41:12.336]  That's a fact.
[01:41:13.017 --> 01:41:13.738]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:41:13.778 --> 01:41:14.938]  This is not adult activity.
[01:41:15.219 --> 01:41:16.179]  This is targeting children.
[01:41:16.199 --> 01:41:17.700]  Now here it is, baby feminist.
[01:41:18.281 --> 01:41:19.962]  And then she says she's a boy in here.
[01:41:20.903 --> 01:41:24.526]  Again, it isn't about a woman if she wants to be a man being a man or thinking she is.
[01:41:24.846 --> 01:41:26.307]  It's about them force-feeding it.
[01:41:26.587 --> 01:41:27.388]  It's all coming up.
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:29.541]  In the next segment.
[01:41:49.927 --> 01:41:53.849]  Make the planet victorious agenda, pro-human, anti-eugenics agenda.
[01:41:54.249 --> 01:41:55.330]  We are the vanguard.
[01:41:55.390 --> 01:42:00.612]  We are the attack ship that goes out from the mothership and goes in and draws the enemy fire.
[01:42:00.993 --> 01:42:03.634]  If they can get us shut down, they believe it's a devastating victory.
[01:42:03.694 --> 01:42:11.758]  So, recommit this July 4th, which I'm calling the kickoff of the second American revolution of information and of prosperity and of truth and of justice.
[01:42:12.799 --> 01:42:15.440]  They're launching their revolution, we're launching ours.

[01:43:19.961 --> 01:43:22.383]  And we're kicking these trainers' asses politically!
[01:43:22.523 --> 01:43:23.744]  And we're not backing down on her!
[01:43:25.024 --> 01:43:26.805]  I wanna get these people!
[01:43:26.845 --> 01:43:27.365]  We're winning!
[01:43:27.426 --> 01:43:28.526]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[01:43:28.666 --> 01:43:29.146]  Can't you?
[01:43:29.427 --> 01:43:31.067]  We have broken their back!
[01:43:31.428 --> 01:43:32.588]  Yes, I can feel it!
[01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.971]  Let's go!

[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:10.381]  The links from Infowars.com.
[01:45:10.862 --> 01:45:13.343]  When you spread the videos, you are changing the world.
[01:45:14.384 --> 01:45:17.746]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:45:18.167 --> 01:45:26.553]  It is you, the Infowarriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:45:26.913 --> 01:45:31.156]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:45:31.476 --> 01:45:32.397]  You are the Infowar.
[01:45:32.917 --> 01:45:36.460]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:48.731]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:45:48.791 --> 01:45:58.681]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:45:59.181 --> 01:45:59.461]  I don't
[01:46:18.985 --> 01:46:22.067]  We're following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country.
[01:46:22.448 --> 01:46:24.509]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:46:24.989 --> 01:46:29.913]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is, or what sex we are, or where we came from.
[01:46:30.494 --> 01:46:38.159]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:45.365]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:45.385 --> 01:46:47.086]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:47.466 --> 01:46:49.027]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:49.347 --> 01:46:50.888]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:51.509 --> 01:46:53.210]  And many others are across the world.
[01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:54.191]  We are the future.
[01:46:55.111 --> 01:46:56.072]  We are the renaissance.
[01:46:56.612 --> 01:46:57.893]  And we are winning.
[01:47:06.699 --> 01:47:09.341]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:42.795]  I've got a topic I'm about to break down that's extremely disturbing, and I'd say parental discretion is advised, but this is what's targeting your children in Target.
[01:47:44.388 --> 01:47:47.450]  Walmart, online, you name it, stuff like this is being sold.
[01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:50.131]  The story is up on Infowars.com.
[01:47:51.011 --> 01:47:53.872]  Dragtots cartoon sparks outrage.
[01:47:54.453 --> 01:47:57.074]  Baby drag queen cartoon marketed to young children.
[01:47:57.779 --> 01:48:08.144]  Now, and they're actually modeled after some of these hideous looking obese men that we've seen in New York and everywhere that they roll out at story time for little kids.
[01:48:08.765 --> 01:48:11.126]  And we've played the video where they're like, you're going to be a drag queen.
[01:48:11.726 --> 01:48:12.607]  Shake your butt.
[01:48:13.147 --> 01:48:14.087]  You know, do all this.
[01:48:14.147 --> 01:48:19.150]  And then they sexualize the children, paint them up, tell them that there's something else.
[01:48:19.610 --> 01:48:22.332]  And then they had the Drag Queen Festival this year here in Austin.
[01:48:22.752 --> 01:48:26.294]  It showed little children as young as two toddling up
[01:48:26.994 --> 01:48:34.057]  And putting money in the g-string of obese men wearing wigs.
[01:48:35.398 --> 01:48:41.981]  I mean, it'd be bad enough if the guys actually looked like women, but it's a celebration of hideousness.
[01:48:43.181 --> 01:48:44.502]  And that's all part of this plan.
[01:48:45.562 --> 01:48:49.524]  And so this is being done everywhere, and they're sexualizing children.
[01:48:50.144 --> 01:48:51.825]  It is completely outrageous.
[01:48:53.928 --> 01:49:00.673]  It's never too early to slip into your first pair of heels, conjure your cheekbones, and learn the basics of drag culture.
[01:49:01.073 --> 01:49:05.356]  Reads an announcement for Drag Tots, an upcoming cartoon about baby drag queens.
[01:49:05.416 --> 01:49:05.636]  See?
[01:49:06.137 --> 01:49:07.438]  How do you sexualize children?
[01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:08.078]  This is how you do it.
[01:49:08.438 --> 01:49:19.046]  And the event in Austin, I mean, we can show it, was men twerking, obese men twerking, show it, show it, in front of small children.
[01:49:21.707 --> 01:49:25.209]  And we've got men pole dancing and shaking their butts in children's face.
[01:49:25.489 --> 01:49:28.230]  Here, let's show TV viewers when the little children run up and give them the money.
[01:49:29.971 --> 01:49:33.853]  So, would you take a three-year-old to the Yellow Rose here in Austin, Texas?
[01:49:34.273 --> 01:49:36.214]  That's a straight strip club.
[01:49:36.235 --> 01:49:38.936]  I mean, I personally knock my cup of tea.
[01:49:39.056 --> 01:49:39.976]  I've been in college.
[01:49:40.477 --> 01:49:43.538]  One time Joe Rogan wanted to go, like 18 years ago we went.
[01:49:43.558 --> 01:49:45.419]  Yeah, I've been to topless bars.
[01:49:45.459 --> 01:49:46.000]  Been to plenty of them.
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:46.420]  Don't like them.
[01:49:47.826 --> 01:49:49.807]  But I'm not condemning people to want to go to them.
[01:49:50.347 --> 01:50:04.853]  But the point is, is that if I saw people at a strip club with a two-year-old sticking a $10 bill in a woman's g-string, I'd walk up and say, what the hell is your problem?
[01:50:06.714 --> 01:50:16.178]  But when they do it, and by the way, there's some photos we put in the video that I don't even know if I should show, like children naked with only glitter on their bodies next to men with only glitter on their genitals.
[01:50:17.648 --> 01:50:20.809]  And I mean, you talk about a freak show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:23.150]  I mean, this is the culture.
[01:50:23.211 --> 01:50:26.132]  This is the cult of sexualizing children.
[01:50:27.152 --> 01:50:30.294]  And children practicing, you know, strip teases.
[01:50:31.274 --> 01:50:33.055]  You know, I can't look at getting money for it.
[01:50:33.115 --> 01:50:34.275]  Take it down, take it down.
[01:50:34.335 --> 01:50:36.376]  This is truly an abomination.
[01:50:38.417 --> 01:50:41.119]  But see, oh, because it's gay or it's liberal, it's okay.
[01:50:41.219 --> 01:50:44.120]  This is just like the guy got busted this week.
[01:50:45.191 --> 01:50:52.057]  Running the big children's charity for abused and kidnapped children, and he was trying to have sex with a two-year-old, and admitted he'd had sex with small children.
[01:50:52.918 --> 01:50:54.019]  He's pled guilty.
[01:50:54.039 --> 01:50:57.002]  I mean, he's admitted that he's had any... Oh, what's the symbol?
[01:50:57.242 --> 01:50:58.283]  The Disney symbol.
[01:50:59.043 --> 01:50:59.664]  But rainbow.
[01:51:00.665 --> 01:51:05.089]  And, oh, we're just sexualizing your kid so they're not sexist or they're not homophobic.
[01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:09.253]  Meanwhile, he'd like to have sex with your two-year-old daughter.
[01:51:11.274 --> 01:51:13.215]  But see, he runs the human rights operation.
[01:51:13.496 --> 01:51:14.756]  He oversees.
[01:51:15.737 --> 01:51:16.818]  And see, everyone's equal.
[01:51:17.779 --> 01:51:22.062]  So if a man wants to have sex with a two-year-old, doesn't matter if it rips their guts off, I'm gonna do it, because it's liberal.
[01:51:23.503 --> 01:51:24.864]  Now, watch this cartoon.
[01:51:25.615 --> 01:51:26.636]  You're a radio listener?
[01:51:26.996 --> 01:51:29.139]  The drag queens have sharp teeth, they're like demons?
[01:51:29.459 --> 01:51:30.320]  Ah, hi kids!
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:31.641]  Put on panties!
[01:51:32.022 --> 01:51:32.582]  Ah, yeah!
[01:51:32.782 --> 01:51:34.744]  Here, learn to shake your butt for the men!
[01:51:34.764 --> 01:51:35.445]  Ah, yeah!
[01:51:35.645 --> 01:51:36.706]  You're another sex now!
[01:51:36.726 --> 01:51:37.187]  Ah, yeah!
[01:51:37.347 --> 01:51:39.149]  We're not introducing Satanism or anything to ya!
[01:51:39.289 --> 01:51:41.031]  This isn't like what people wear in satanic rituals!
[01:51:41.271 --> 01:51:42.112]  Outfits like clowns!
[01:51:42.152 --> 01:51:42.472]  No!
[01:51:42.632 --> 01:51:44.674]  This is children's programming in Hollywood!
[01:51:44.894 --> 01:51:45.435]  Ah, yeah!
[01:51:45.976 --> 01:51:47.338]  Sure, we hope your economy collapses.
[01:51:47.538 --> 01:51:48.480]  Sure, drink some fluoride.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.182]  We're sorry you didn't get aborted when you were born.
[01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:53.567]  Or just be a nice to everybody and socialize with the kids, be friendly.
[01:51:53.587 --> 01:51:56.352]  So, let's go ahead and watch Drag Tots.
[01:51:56.412 --> 01:51:56.893]  Here it is.
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.701]  Roxy, moron!
[01:52:04.201 --> 01:52:06.622]  Why do you have so many books, sis?
[01:52:07.082 --> 01:52:11.323]  Oh, Corny, I heard the library was open because we got a big reading assignment.
[01:52:11.883 --> 01:52:15.164]  Whoa, whoops!
[01:52:15.524 --> 01:52:17.245]  Well, that's using your head.
[01:52:17.265 --> 01:52:19.626]  Gone with the Weave?
[01:52:20.246 --> 01:52:21.146]  Story of my life.
[01:52:21.766 --> 01:52:25.187]  All Quiet on the Western Lace Front at Moby Tuck.
[01:52:25.948 --> 01:52:28.608]  The Diva Rules by Michelle Visage.
[01:52:29.249 --> 01:52:30.229]  Talk about fiction.
[01:52:32.922 --> 01:52:37.403]  Roxy, it's not that kind of a reading assignment.
[01:52:38.763 --> 01:52:41.744]  Reading is part of our drag herstory.
[01:52:42.344 --> 01:52:46.165]  It's how queens communicate and tease each other.
[01:52:46.185 --> 01:52:48.285]  Said with love.
[01:52:48.986 --> 01:52:49.866]  Most of the time.
[01:52:50.346 --> 01:52:52.066]  You're not a true queen until you can read.
[01:52:52.466 --> 01:52:53.427]  Because reading is what?
[01:52:53.687 --> 01:52:54.947]  Find a mantle.
[01:52:58.777 --> 01:52:59.577]  Drag tots!
[01:52:59.617 --> 01:53:01.758]  The sexualization of toddlers!
[01:53:02.378 --> 01:53:04.339]  Which Nickelodeon said was their goal 10 years ago.
[01:53:04.779 --> 01:53:08.180]  They said, we brought kids to sexualization at 10, we're going to do it at 5.
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.761]  And then they had people dressed up like horrific demons.
[01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:14.102]  I'd have seen that when I was a kid on a run for the hills.
[01:53:14.862 --> 01:53:18.323]  And, it's the total exploitation.
[01:53:19.673 --> 01:53:32.641]  The total weaponization of media used to have, oh, I'm going to be an astronaut, or a doctor, or a nurse, or a scientist, or a farmer, or a police officer, or a firefighter, or, you know, I'm going to be an explorer, or I'm going to help poor children, I'm going to be a school teacher.
[01:53:32.681 --> 01:53:32.961]  No!
[01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:35.963]  Now, you're going to be a drag tot!
[01:53:36.423 --> 01:53:43.788]  And we're going to use the most hideous examples of this to absolutely break your will and make you accept all of it.
[01:53:44.268 --> 01:53:48.690]  And it's all Tavistock Institute in the UK, they're paying for young children to have their genitals cut off.
[01:53:49.853 --> 01:53:51.274]  So, you want to know how society falls?
[01:53:52.115 --> 01:54:01.324]  The sickness, the decadence of Hollywood and the entertainment industry and the fashion industry, like a weapon spewing pure death at everyone you know.
[01:54:01.724 --> 01:54:02.665]  And just, ah, see?
[01:54:02.705 --> 01:54:03.886]  It's all just, ah, ah!
[01:54:04.367 --> 01:54:06.208]  Hey, pull up the Satanists, they were in the Daily Mail.
[01:54:06.969 --> 01:54:09.171]  How they dress in the rituals, and it's outfits like that.
[01:54:09.471 --> 01:54:12.874]  Just all crazy and scary and everyone, Hi kids!
[01:54:13.234 --> 01:54:13.815]  Hi!
[01:54:14.415 --> 01:54:16.397]  Hi, I'm gonna teach you about your sex.
[01:54:16.857 --> 01:54:24.743]  Normally it'd be when you're 10 or 11 years old, your parents would tell you the basics, but that's okay, you're 4 years old, you're 3 years old, I'm gonna teach you now.
[01:54:25.244 --> 01:54:25.764]  Okay?
[01:54:26.325 --> 01:54:30.188]  Here, I'm gonna teach you how it is on Epstein's Aircraft.
[01:54:34.329 --> 01:54:36.330]  We're gonna teach you how it is!
[01:54:36.711 --> 01:54:38.832]  We're gonna teach you we can do whatever we want!
[01:54:38.952 --> 01:54:39.773]  It's all about us!
[01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:43.295]  Your kids belong to us!
[01:54:51.781 --> 01:55:03.649]  You can show the story times from Austin, Texas to New York City where they take two-year-olds and they will be obese, bizarre-looking, crazy men with vampire fangs and devil horns going, I like to teach
[01:55:07.261 --> 01:55:17.903]  Boy, if you're a girl, and we're putting chemicals in the water to help with everything, then it's gonna get a lot easier from here on out to bring down this third dimension down to us.
[01:55:17.943 --> 01:55:20.004]  We're gonna destroy you!
[01:55:20.264 --> 01:55:23.264]  You will ascend to hell in the reverse order!
[01:55:23.284 --> 01:55:26.925]  Oh, I get it.
[01:55:27.425 --> 01:55:28.526]  Oh, you're so enlightened.
[01:55:28.546 --> 01:55:30.146]  You're so powerful!
[01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:32.345]  Weak?
[01:55:33.106 --> 01:55:41.010]  We've been asleep, and now we're awake, and now you can feel the Spirit of Christ re-entering the planet as you panic.
[01:55:42.311 --> 01:55:48.375]  And all of your... Look how weak and slobberlish and pathetic and chicken-necked all their servants are.
[01:55:49.195 --> 01:55:52.257]  Sucked, soul-sucked fallen slaves.
[01:55:52.717 --> 01:55:55.439]  But behind them is always the Dracula's.
[01:55:56.901 --> 01:56:04.168]  Say, now no fear, because we're coming like the villagers in the night with the torches burning bright with fire.
[01:56:05.869 --> 01:56:08.071]  Fire is not the weapon of evil.
[01:56:08.571 --> 01:56:12.635]  Fire is the weapon of good, and it will consume you.
[01:56:16.878 --> 01:56:17.739]  Yes.
[01:56:20.221 --> 01:56:22.804]  Yes, you don't have to fear your God.
[01:56:23.084 --> 01:56:24.025]  You need to fear God.
[01:56:25.359 --> 01:56:27.420]  Your God has stolen your soul.
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:31.924]  Your God took away the key that you gave it.
[01:56:33.385 --> 01:56:51.077]  And now you stare into the fathomless depths of eternal phantom zone destruction, and you want to take as many children with you down that hole as you can, so you can clutch their souls as you fall towards the dark heart of that black hole.
[01:56:54.574 --> 01:56:58.215]  Soon the icy cold of hell will embrace you forever.
[01:56:59.135 --> 01:57:01.776]  Soon you will pass through and on.
[01:57:02.476 --> 01:57:04.076]  Never to return to this dimension.
[01:57:04.636 --> 01:57:05.717]  Never to ascend.
[01:57:06.117 --> 01:57:08.417]  But down, down, down, down.
[01:57:08.837 --> 01:57:11.998]  Down, down, down into that black hole you're going.
[01:57:12.378 --> 01:57:12.998]  Chained.
[01:57:14.038 --> 01:57:16.399]  And by the way, you think God's gonna let you get all those kids?
[01:57:16.419 --> 01:57:17.619]  That's why you try to corrupt them so early?
[01:57:18.419 --> 01:57:20.400]  You're not gonna be even able to do that.
[01:57:21.547 --> 01:57:26.831]  Many of the children you've abused will be the strongest people ever that will turn against you and bring you down.
[01:57:28.552 --> 01:57:32.295]  Because from the foundations of the earth, you are losers.
[01:57:32.695 --> 01:57:36.377]  And you are always to be there to test the righteous.
[01:57:37.118 --> 01:57:48.286]  Hour number three, your phone calls to people that faced the Antifa hordes in Portland and more in the pre-4th of July operation that is the InfoWar.
[01:57:58.516 --> 01:58:03.798]  We acknowledge in this country that we can't, we cannot accept this.
[01:58:04.478 --> 01:58:05.338]  I can't do a whoop.
[01:58:05.498 --> 01:58:06.118]  I'm sorry.
[01:58:06.418 --> 01:58:07.219]  We can't do it.
[01:58:07.999 --> 01:58:18.222]  And the Oscar goes to... What was your response, Phil Mudd?
[01:58:18.262 --> 01:58:19.562]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[01:58:19.862 --> 01:58:22.383]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[01:58:22.743 --> 01:58:24.364]  Well, Trey Gowdy ought to have his a** kicked.
[01:58:26.965 --> 01:58:27.705]  I am a proud
[01:58:31.264 --> 01:58:33.905]  The s**tholers built this country 110 years ago.
[01:58:33.925 --> 01:58:35.966]  They were called slopers and slant-eyes.
[01:58:37.827 --> 01:58:49.732]  The National Institute of Standards and Technology acknowledged that the World Trade Center Building 7 fell off free-fall acceleration for over 100 feet on 9-11, which means it was meeting no resistance for eight stories.
[01:58:50.172 --> 01:58:57.715]  So, sparing me a diatribe about conspiracy theories, can you please give me a straight answer on how you think that's scientifically possible without the use of explosives?
[01:59:00.723 --> 01:59:02.364]  Look, I think we should pass on this question.
[01:59:02.384 --> 01:59:07.446]  If you want to tell me that there's something going on beyond two planes going into buildings, I never saw anything that suggested it.
[01:59:07.866 --> 01:59:12.107]  That was the most investigated event probably in FBI investigative history.
[01:59:12.127 --> 01:59:14.608]  I just, you know, I don't want to spend time on this question.
[01:59:14.668 --> 01:59:15.529]  I don't think it's valid.
[01:59:28.663 --> 01:59:36.408]  When we call the Chinese man a slant-eye, when we call the man from Guatemala a spic in a wetback, and we call the black man a n****r.
[01:59:56.661 --> 02:00:00.024]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:00.084 --> 02:00:01.025]  Turn it on!
[02:00:01.145 --> 02:00:01.986]  Leave it on!
[02:00:02.026 --> 02:00:02.627]  America!
[02:00:02.767 --> 02:00:08.993]  See the music you want to see!
[02:00:09.193 --> 02:00:10.554]  I want my InfoWars!
[02:00:10.974 --> 02:00:11.855]  InfoWars.com!
[02:00:12.336 --> 02:00:13.136]  InfoWars.com!
[02:00:13.156 --> 02:00:14.358]  I want my InfoWars!
[02:00:14.438 --> 02:00:15.679]  I want my InfoWars!
[02:00:31.303 --> 02:00:34.466]  I've got loaded phone lines, and I've got two folks joining us.
[02:00:34.506 --> 02:00:37.970]  We'll take calls while they're on as well, who were at the whole Antifa situation.
[02:00:38.837 --> 02:00:39.337]  In Portland.
[02:00:39.757 --> 02:00:43.438]  And I could see it, I could feel it, I could see the crescendo building, the talking points.
[02:00:43.858 --> 02:00:47.559]  Millions need to march, surround the Capitol, surround the White House, drive Trump out.
[02:00:47.579 --> 02:00:51.340]  It was the same thing they said last year in the full-page ads, but that was the beta test.
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:54.880]  They're making their move, kicking off basically now.
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:01:02.802]  That's why you've got people getting confronted, you've got threats, you've got physical threats, you've got bricks through windows, you've got protests turned violent as demonstrators arrested.
[02:01:04.059 --> 02:01:05.520]  In front of Philadelphia ICE building?
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:12.124]  They're saying having a border, having any border police, having any law and order, is terrorist.
[02:01:13.284 --> 02:01:16.146]  This is their abolish ICE, abolish the border, UN movement.
[02:01:18.307 --> 02:01:24.491]  Also, man assaulted outside, assaulted officer outside White House after rally, say the feds.
[02:01:24.951 --> 02:01:29.354]  I mean, it is starting to pour in, ladies and gentlemen, that they're trying to create
[02:01:31.223 --> 02:01:32.064]  This big breakdown.
[02:01:32.124 --> 02:01:38.550]  So there's a good chance I'll end up being live tomorrow with emergency broadcast because you know they're heating up for some serious things.
[02:01:40.211 --> 02:01:42.774]  Now, who should we go to first?
[02:01:47.878 --> 02:01:48.078]  Hmm.
[02:01:48.098 --> 02:01:51.502]  There's so many people to get to here.
[02:01:51.962 --> 02:01:53.804]  Trying to tie something into the whole unrest thing.
[02:01:55.017 --> 02:01:59.040]  Let's talk to Tyler in Wisconsin, who was attending a Keeping Families Together rally.
[02:01:59.481 --> 02:02:00.221]  Antifa violence.
[02:02:00.401 --> 02:02:01.723]  What did you see, Tyler?
[02:02:02.743 --> 02:02:10.310]  Well, you know, what I saw on TV anyways, with the antifa violence in Portland, you saw what happened there, right?
[02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:12.231]  You saw the violence, the attacks?
[02:02:12.451 --> 02:02:12.952]  Yeah, I saw.
[02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:15.454]  I mean, the police admit that the antifa started it, yes.
[02:02:16.636 --> 02:02:16.816]  Yes.
[02:02:17.136 --> 02:02:20.878]  So I was in Madison, Wisconsin at a Keeping Families Together rally.
[02:02:21.358 --> 02:02:25.180]  And I don't know if you know about Madison, the demographics here, but it's a lot like Austin.
[02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:26.901]  It's a blue bubble.
[02:02:26.961 --> 02:02:30.502]  It's a liberal bubble in the middle of a bunch of working class folks.
[02:02:30.782 --> 02:02:31.163]  Exactly.
[02:02:31.203 --> 02:02:33.864]  It's a parasitic, liberal, parasite bubble.
[02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:35.311]  Exactly.
[02:02:35.431 --> 02:02:37.173]  And it's such an echo chamber.
[02:02:37.413 --> 02:02:44.100]  So the Antifa here, they don't have to get violent with people because no one goes out on the streets to resist this stuff.
[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:47.403]  There's no Trump supporters.
[02:02:47.443 --> 02:02:51.467]  Me and my friends were the only Trump supporters in attendance at this entire thing.
[02:02:52.128 --> 02:02:56.953]  And we were wearing the Hillary for Prison shirts, and we were wearing the Make America Great Again hat.
[02:02:57.768 --> 02:03:05.392]  And, uh, we went out there and we were getting just dirty looks from people, but there was music playing and, uh, we just went out and we started a dance party.
[02:03:05.873 --> 02:03:06.833]  That's what we decided to do.
[02:03:07.593 --> 02:03:13.116]  We went out and decided to start a dance party and see if we could get some people from the other side to just come out and dance with us.
[02:03:13.537 --> 02:03:17.639]  And I was on, uh, I was on the war room with Owen Schreier last week as a guest.
[02:03:18.199 --> 02:03:22.922]  And, uh, I, I, I was, uh, I got so many messages from the listeners.
[02:03:26.449 --> 02:03:28.691]  We need to get our people out on the streets.
[02:03:28.751 --> 02:03:29.431]  It's so important.
[02:03:29.511 --> 02:03:34.255]  And then videotape what you do and put it up on YouTube and places because that's how we're going to win the information war.
[02:03:34.715 --> 02:03:42.741]  Just showing how bizarre and hateful the left is, just showing how they look like a bunch of feckless zombies, really illustrates what happened to these people.
[02:03:43.062 --> 02:03:44.323]  You go to a leftist rally,
[02:03:45.353 --> 02:03:46.834]  They look like they're dead.
[02:03:46.874 --> 02:03:48.015]  I don't care what color they are.
[02:03:48.395 --> 02:03:51.738]  And you look at conservatives or just libertarians, they're all like red-blooded.
[02:03:52.618 --> 02:03:56.561]  I could walk over to a white person, black person, you name it, and guess.
[02:03:56.621 --> 02:03:57.281]  Are you conservative?
[02:03:57.301 --> 02:03:58.082]  You're a Christian, aren't you?
[02:03:58.522 --> 02:04:04.787]  And if it's like some really outstanding, you know, family, white folks, black folks, whatever, they'll go, yeah, we're Christians, we're pro-America.
[02:04:05.247 --> 02:04:06.188]  And you can just see it.
[02:04:06.888 --> 02:04:11.191]  It's really becoming like a dichotomy, like something has sucked the souls of these people.
[02:04:11.391 --> 02:04:12.032]  Have you noticed that?
[02:04:13.251 --> 02:04:17.293]  I have noticed that, and like you said about taking your video camera out and doing it.
[02:04:17.633 --> 02:04:31.899]  Like, I knew you guys were doing the InfoWars reporter submission, but I didn't really want to enter the contest because I don't want to, like, take a handout because I saw what happened to the last guy who gave a handout with the long hair who lived in his grandma's basement, and we haven't heard from that guy since, what, two months now?
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:32.920]  Have we heard from that guy?
[02:04:34.645 --> 02:04:40.869]  So, like, but I got so much support from the listeners on The Water Room, and I decided to get my crew together.
[02:04:40.889 --> 02:04:41.529]  We don't know anything.
[02:04:41.549 --> 02:04:42.670]  We just got our cameras out.
[02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.811]  We learned how to edit.
[02:04:43.871 --> 02:04:47.253]  We actually put together the report, and we entered it into the InfoWars.
[02:04:47.433 --> 02:04:47.893]  Good, good.
[02:04:47.933 --> 02:04:48.954]  What's the name of the report?
[02:04:50.235 --> 02:04:56.359]  The name of the report is InfoWars Dance Party, and it's on the Tyler Baggins YouTube channel right now.
[02:04:56.719 --> 02:04:56.939]  Great.
[02:04:56.979 --> 02:04:57.560]  I gotta jump.
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:58.000]  Thank you.
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:04:59.000]  So much more coming up.
[02:04:59.181 --> 02:04:59.601]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.939 --> 02:05:05.860]  This 4th of July is special.
[02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:07.361]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[02:05:07.881 --> 02:05:12.023]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[02:05:12.323 --> 02:05:15.984]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[02:05:16.685 --> 02:05:21.767]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[02:05:21.787 --> 02:05:25.529]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[02:05:26.389 --> 02:05:28.271]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[02:05:28.672 --> 02:05:30.554]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[02:05:30.634 --> 02:05:33.737]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[02:05:33.777 --> 02:05:40.464]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[02:05:40.924 --> 02:05:42.806]  We have record sales going on right now.

[02:06:09.464 --> 02:06:11.566]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:06:11.826 --> 02:06:12.907]  I believe in you!
[02:06:13.307 --> 02:06:14.448]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:06:14.508 --> 02:06:21.054]  One man ever writes a woman, all genitals are cut off!
[02:06:21.294 --> 02:06:23.756]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:06:23.856 --> 02:06:25.077]  And we're not backing down on her!
[02:06:26.318 --> 02:06:28.140]  I want to kick these people!
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:28.700]  We're winning!
[02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:29.841]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:06:30.001 --> 02:06:30.482]  Can't you?
[02:06:30.742 --> 02:06:32.403]  We have broken their back!
[02:06:32.764 --> 02:06:33.885]  Yes, I can feel it!

[02:07:00.010 --> 02:07:00.190]  Come on!
[02:07:00.210 --> 02:07:00.310]  Come
[02:07:08.795 --> 02:07:12.838]  So, you've been on YouTube for years and you don't know who I am.
[02:07:14.098 --> 02:07:19.722]  I'm primitive.
[02:07:19.962 --> 02:07:20.502]  I'm real.
[02:07:20.662 --> 02:07:21.243]  I know the enemy.
[02:07:21.303 --> 02:07:25.505]  And if we can have the spirit of normal humanity spread, it's over for the globalists!
[02:07:26.326 --> 02:07:29.888]  You'll never, never defeat the human spirit!
[02:07:30.088 --> 02:07:32.190]  You'll never defeat God!
[02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:33.851]  You'll never win!
[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:37.602]  We know who they are, and we're sick of them!
[02:07:37.642 --> 02:07:44.768]  You guys know who he is?
[02:07:44.848 --> 02:07:46.149]  You know Alex Jones as InfoWars?
[02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:48.771]  Very popular.
[02:07:48.891 --> 02:07:49.331]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:49.351 --> 02:07:49.732]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:49.852 --> 02:07:50.432]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:50.512 --> 02:07:51.393]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:51.533 --> 02:07:52.994]  Alex Jones for Alex Jones.
[02:07:53.114 --> 02:07:53.835]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:53.875 --> 02:07:54.876]  From InfoWars.
[02:07:54.956 --> 02:07:55.697]  InfoWars.
[02:07:55.717 --> 02:07:56.237]  Yeah.
[02:07:56.297 --> 02:07:57.898]  But did that stop him?
[02:07:57.918 --> 02:07:58.018]  No!
[02:07:58.078 --> 02:07:59.099]  It did not!
[02:08:01.970 --> 02:08:08.300]  The more they abuse you, the more you enjoy it.
[02:08:08.341 --> 02:08:10.224]  It's like the Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:08:10.504 --> 02:08:13.168]  And so that's why the joke is on you.
[02:08:13.188 --> 02:08:15.051]  And that's why it's gonna continue.
[02:08:25.439 --> 02:08:27.700]  You can't now!
[02:08:28.161 --> 02:08:30.882]  I know your mustache is gold!
[02:08:30.982 --> 02:08:35.265]  You got little gold-framed glasses!
[02:08:35.325 --> 02:08:38.907]  You scare me so bad!
[02:08:38.967 --> 02:08:43.909]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:54.793 --> 02:08:56.795]  We've got our guest coming up.
[02:08:56.815 --> 02:09:04.641]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:09:04.721 --> 02:09:15.649]  Alex Jones, the foray conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.929]  Scum!
[02:09:18.071 --> 02:09:20.272]  Russian scum!
[02:09:24.665 --> 02:09:31.013]  You know why those intros say Alex Jones, Alex Jones so much?
[02:09:44.605 --> 02:09:54.468]  Because we can take even small radio stations that have no ratings and usually get them mid-level or high ratings within a year because that's how it works with Arbitron and all that is name recognition.
[02:09:54.488 --> 02:09:55.789]  So you gotta say the name over and over again.
[02:09:56.089 --> 02:09:58.309]  The radio stations like that because that's how they stay afloat.
[02:09:59.010 --> 02:10:02.030]  Okay, we are back live well into the third hour.
[02:10:02.131 --> 02:10:05.732]  Our guests will be riding shotgun with us for the hour, maybe a little bit longer.
[02:10:05.812 --> 02:10:06.772]  I know we've got loaded phones.
[02:10:06.812 --> 02:10:13.074]  We'll also pop in and get your calls on Mueller, on the Liberals calling for revolution, all of it.
[02:10:15.785 --> 02:10:20.009]  Joey Gibson is the founder of the Patriot Prayer Group and is running for U.S.
[02:10:20.049 --> 02:10:20.950]  Senate as a Republican.
[02:10:20.970 --> 02:10:24.833]  Joey is fighting for freedom with the strength and power from God and love.
[02:10:24.913 --> 02:10:26.335]  Gibsonforfreedom.com.
[02:10:27.035 --> 02:10:29.698]  And he goes out to these events.
[02:10:29.718 --> 02:10:30.799]  He just has prayer vigils.
[02:10:30.859 --> 02:10:33.461]  And the left gets really triggered by that and comes out.
[02:10:34.062 --> 02:10:35.383]  And they do it up and down the West Coast.
[02:10:35.423 --> 02:10:36.504]  Will Johnson also does it.
[02:10:36.524 --> 02:10:37.525]  UnitedAmericaFirst.com.
[02:10:37.545 --> 02:10:40.107]  What a great website, but even greater info he's involved in.
[02:10:40.868 --> 02:10:44.029]  He's the founder of the United American First, a movement that began during the 2016 election.
[02:10:44.209 --> 02:10:45.890]  And I've heard him talk on my show and others about it.
[02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:49.312]  He just kept seeing the lies, and the race baiting, and how evil it was.
[02:10:49.372 --> 02:10:51.493]  He just had this knot in his gut, this knot in his chest.
[02:10:51.813 --> 02:10:52.413]  I'm the same way.
[02:10:52.433 --> 02:10:56.775]  I can be totally exhausted, like 8 at night, something big happens, and I just suddenly have all this energy.
[02:10:57.115 --> 02:10:58.215]  Like when they attack me, too.
[02:10:58.355 --> 02:10:59.856]  I don't like being attacked when I know they're lying.
[02:10:59.956 --> 02:11:03.558]  I suddenly... It doesn't make me get scared when they do these horrible things to me.
[02:11:03.778 --> 02:11:04.398]  It's the opposite.
[02:11:04.418 --> 02:11:05.358]  People say, oh, you're so brave.
[02:11:05.838 --> 02:11:06.259]  Brave?
[02:11:07.757 --> 02:11:08.517]  I'd really be brave.
[02:11:08.557 --> 02:11:10.679]  I'd just lay down and let these dogs chew my guts out.
[02:11:10.719 --> 02:11:11.339]  It's the opposite.
[02:11:11.359 --> 02:11:12.520]  I'm fighting for my life here.
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:13.820]  These people are evil!
[02:11:15.321 --> 02:11:16.422]  That's what we're talking about here.
[02:11:17.042 --> 02:11:19.043]  So, Will Johnson and Joey Gibson.
[02:11:19.323 --> 02:11:21.164]  Let's go to Will first, but jump in any time, Joey.
[02:11:21.825 --> 02:11:23.165]  Wow, what happened this weekend.
[02:11:23.545 --> 02:11:26.027]  Even the local news had to admit Antifa attack first.
[02:11:27.367 --> 02:11:27.948]  Bottles.
[02:11:28.208 --> 02:11:28.768]  Well, you were there.
[02:11:28.828 --> 02:11:29.649]  Tell folks what happened.
[02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:39.216]  I want to thank you for having me on again, and I'm thankful for Joey to invite me to his event.
[02:11:39.936 --> 02:11:41.197]  It was absolutely crazy.
[02:11:41.317 --> 02:11:42.599]  We were completely peaceful.
[02:11:42.639 --> 02:11:44.680]  DHS did a beautiful job.
[02:11:44.821 --> 02:11:46.122]  They did an awesome job.
[02:11:46.662 --> 02:11:47.863]  They protected all of us.
[02:11:48.344 --> 02:11:53.608]  When we were going into the event, if anyone had peppermints or anything like that, they had to give it to DHS.
[02:11:53.909 --> 02:11:58.793]  So we didn't have anything to protect ourselves from these Antifa domestic terrorist groups.
[02:11:59.432 --> 02:12:03.393]  But it was absolutely insane for what they were doing.
[02:12:03.433 --> 02:12:05.194]  It's just like Berkeley all over again.
[02:12:05.974 --> 02:12:12.616]  We go there, we're completely peaceful, we're Trump supporters, we're black, we're brown, we're white, we're all together.
[02:12:12.756 --> 02:12:13.556]  No one's fighting.
[02:12:13.876 --> 02:12:19.538]  It's only when we go out onto the streets where Antifa and the Portland police didn't do their job to protect us.
[02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:26.556]  Well, that's in the Soros documents that they work with Blue City Police to stand down, even let them engage in violence.
[02:12:28.038 --> 02:12:33.064]  Joey, tell us about your prayer group, the events you've had, and why you think Antifa particularly attacks these.
[02:12:35.066 --> 02:12:42.851]  Yeah, so basically, you know, we started doing this because we saw people getting beat up in the streets during the Trump election down in San Jose.
[02:12:42.931 --> 02:13:01.763]  So the goal was to go out and just challenge it and expose them, but at the same time, you know, our rhetoric has always been about love and prayer and talking about God, yet these people come out of nowhere and they hate the freedom aspect, okay, because a lot of them are communists, and they seem to just really hate the message of God, like they despise it.
[02:13:02.563 --> 02:13:09.613]  They just come from all over the West Coast to whatever rally we're throwing and they're going to use violence and do whatever it takes to silence us.
[02:13:10.959 --> 02:13:14.381]  What was the big takeaway from this latest one, A, and then B?
[02:13:14.441 --> 02:13:14.721]  It's here.
[02:13:14.761 --> 02:13:15.621]  They say revolution.
[02:13:15.661 --> 02:13:16.922]  They say they're going to launch the attacks.
[02:13:17.182 --> 02:13:19.603]  There's arrests all over the country, attacks happening everywhere.
[02:13:20.003 --> 02:13:25.265]  Behind the scenes, I can't get to it yet on air, they have launched attacks against me and my family that are out of a Twilight Zone movie.
[02:13:25.326 --> 02:13:30.988]  I mean, I'm talking basically like intelligence agencies, but it's the Democratic Party and Soros.
[02:13:31.268 --> 02:13:32.549]  He's put $18 billion in.
[02:13:32.889 --> 02:13:34.970]  I mean, this is, the battle is really heating up.
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:38.401]  I would say there's two things to take from this.
[02:13:38.441 --> 02:13:44.623]  Number one, you know, we're at a point now, it's unfortunate, you know, I have a lot of respect for most of the police.
[02:13:45.063 --> 02:13:49.884]  I think most of the police officers, they want to do their job, but right now they're just standing down, especially in Portland, Oregon.
[02:13:50.285 --> 02:13:56.787]  And so I kind of want to make a call for these guys to make a conscientious decision to protect the Constitution, which is the First Amendment.
[02:13:57.127 --> 02:14:02.769]  If you get an order from someone above you that's asking you to go against the Constitution, you need to do what is right.
[02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:17.234]  The second thing I'm going to take from this is if the police are going to stand down and we're not going to have law and order, you're going to have patriots from all over the country come in and they're going to do their job like you saw on Saturday because they had Antifa, they had Sharp members running scared.
[02:14:18.014 --> 02:14:28.198]  There's that viral video where that Sharp member, you know, had a baton, went up against a guy, a proud boy who had nothing but his arm, you know, blocked it twice, hit him with one punch and he was out.
[02:14:28.398 --> 02:14:28.818]  He was done.
[02:14:29.278 --> 02:14:32.299]  And so I think patriots will begin to stand up and take back the streets.
[02:14:33.743 --> 02:14:43.947]  And again, I've watched hours of your videos, how they would throw the bottles, they would attack first, the police stood down, you guys would kick their butt, like Tommy Robinson fighting off nine guys himself, even though he's a little guy.
[02:14:44.267 --> 02:14:47.869]  Describe the essence of that, and then we're gonna go to break of what happened.
[02:14:51.027 --> 02:14:54.528]  So yeah, it's like, okay, let's talk about June 3rd, for example.
[02:14:54.588 --> 02:14:57.149]  So that was the first Portland rally a few weeks ago.
[02:14:57.749 --> 02:15:03.130]  You have these Antifa kids chasing after families, people who can't really defend themselves.
[02:15:03.530 --> 02:15:10.932]  You look at Haley Adams and her family, they attacked them, you know, stole their property, beat them up because they saw them as an easy target.
[02:15:11.372 --> 02:15:13.715]  Same thing with an elderly man, Kerry Hudson.
[02:15:13.755 --> 02:15:17.959]  They went after them because they can't take on the real patriots willing to defend themselves.
[02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:25.267]  So June 30th comes along and there's all this rhetoric about how I'm not going to be able to show up because they're going to kill me, they're going to stab me.
[02:15:25.627 --> 02:15:26.348]  All this talk.
[02:15:26.448 --> 02:15:31.394]  They show up, they go running down the streets and the patriots just chase them a whole block down.
[02:15:31.834 --> 02:15:34.174]  We just showed dramatic footage we'll come back with again.
[02:15:34.194 --> 02:15:35.095]  You were there.
[02:15:35.115 --> 02:15:42.876]  I mean, you've got a guy with one of those extendable metal clubs you can kill somebody with, a police baton, basically, an extendable baton.
[02:15:43.576 --> 02:15:45.516]  They could break your bones, whipping it at you.
[02:15:45.856 --> 02:15:52.438]  And of course, a fellow steps in and just, boom, total KO, knockout, boom.
[02:15:52.758 --> 02:15:54.438]  And the woman tries to attack you.
[02:15:54.458 --> 02:15:54.918]  That's their thing.
[02:15:54.938 --> 02:15:56.018]  They try to get women to attack you.
[02:15:56.198 --> 02:15:57.138]  So you've got to defend yourself.
[02:15:57.158 --> 02:15:58.179]  And they go, oh, you attacked a woman.
[02:15:58.439 --> 02:15:59.939]  Well, yeah, you just got in a man's world, lady.
[02:16:02.702 --> 02:16:16.975]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[02:16:19.397 --> 02:16:25.483]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[02:16:26.897 --> 02:16:29.437]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[02:16:30.218 --> 02:16:33.638]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[02:16:34.578 --> 02:16:36.759]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[02:16:38.459 --> 02:16:43.660]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:52.202]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[02:16:53.162 --> 02:16:54.142]  It's up to us personally.
[02:16:55.552 --> 02:17:02.405]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[02:17:02.906 --> 02:17:04.209]  I expected that to happen.
[02:17:05.391 --> 02:17:06.734]  This is 21st century warfare.
[02:17:08.706 --> 02:17:19.630]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:21.871]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[02:17:22.571 --> 02:17:34.196]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[02:17:34.776 --> 02:17:36.957]  And we've already come so far together
[02:17:38.001 --> 02:17:47.005]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[02:17:47.585 --> 02:17:52.987]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[02:17:54.128 --> 02:18:02.011]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[02:18:04.252 --> 02:18:12.521]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[02:18:12.901 --> 02:18:14.483]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[02:18:15.484 --> 02:18:18.147]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[02:18:18.948 --> 02:18:20.770]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[02:18:20.810 --> 02:18:25.695]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[02:18:26.796 --> 02:18:37.565]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[02:18:37.605 --> 02:18:41.568]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[02:18:43.001 --> 02:18:43.682]  Our game changing.
[02:18:44.062 --> 02:18:45.564]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[02:18:45.764 --> 02:18:46.926]  The other equation of probiotic.
[02:18:46.986 --> 02:18:50.550]  It's now stronger and a lower price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:50.850 --> 02:18:51.971]  We've got the real red pill.
[02:18:52.051 --> 02:18:56.396]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[02:18:56.957 --> 02:19:00.000]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:01.322]  It just does incredible things.
[02:19:01.742 --> 02:19:03.184]  Look into the real red pill for yourself.
[02:19:03.584 --> 02:19:06.165]  Then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[02:19:06.185 --> 02:19:14.087]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste that's fortified with colloidal silver and iodine and other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[02:19:14.708 --> 02:19:25.831]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[02:19:26.291 --> 02:19:31.293]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, the ionized water, stevia, peppermint,
[02:19:31.673 --> 02:19:33.174]  Essential oil and so much more.
[02:19:33.214 --> 02:19:34.515]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[02:19:34.715 --> 02:19:35.916]  You can swallow it as well.
[02:19:36.296 --> 02:19:42.580]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:44.261]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:19:44.301 --> 02:19:53.907]  So, thank you all for remembering Infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:19:54.227 --> 02:19:57.269]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:20:06.098 --> 02:20:08.819]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.802 --> 02:20:19.383]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:19.483 --> 02:20:25.765]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:25.846 --> 02:20:34.669]  You know, I could make a movie called Cowards or Yellow Bellies with all the videos we've got the last 10 years of Antifa.
[02:20:36.325 --> 02:20:38.287]  Beating up women, people in wheelchairs.
[02:20:38.787 --> 02:20:43.212]  They come out to Christian rallies and will run up and hit a woman in the back of the head.
[02:20:43.252 --> 02:20:45.914]  They are the archetypal weasel wimps.
[02:20:46.895 --> 02:20:50.258]  And then you look at the average antifa, they're like a meth-head shriveled white kid.
[02:20:51.317 --> 02:20:54.940]  Or Professor, running around screaming about racist white people everywhere.
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:57.683]  They'll have the occasional mental patient or meth head.
[02:20:58.383 --> 02:21:04.729]  They show up with their clubs and weapons and then as soon as one of them gets knocked out, they always turn and run.
[02:21:04.749 --> 02:21:08.312]  And you'll see them target women with bike locks and a whole crowd do it.
[02:21:09.153 --> 02:21:09.714]  It's incredible.
[02:21:09.754 --> 02:21:18.380]  So we've got Will Johnson, who's with UnitedAmericanFirst.com, and Joey Gibson, who has these Christian prayer group rallies, where they're all-inclusive and just trying to have peace.
[02:21:18.841 --> 02:21:19.841]  And people come out and attack.
[02:21:19.901 --> 02:21:22.944]  As they said a few weeks ago in Portland, they attacked men, women, children.
[02:21:23.024 --> 02:21:27.728]  Hell, in Berkeley, they attacked Millie Weaver and her husband and baby and attacked their car.
[02:21:28.108 --> 02:21:31.531]  I've told Millie don't go out there without security, but she still does, and so she's got a lot of courage.
[02:21:31.971 --> 02:21:35.754]  But the fact that you have to go out, these families try to go to Fourth of July parades.
[02:21:36.214 --> 02:21:38.296]  They just caught a guy trying to blow it up in Cleveland.
[02:21:38.496 --> 02:21:40.537]  We're gonna get toy cars with bombs in it.
[02:21:41.458 --> 02:21:44.900]  It's just the level of the hate and the insanity.
[02:21:45.361 --> 02:21:46.601]  And this guy they just arrested.
[02:21:47.622 --> 02:21:50.884]  Document Cam shot on this guy if we can, or maybe pull it up on Infowars.com.
[02:21:51.305 --> 02:21:55.688]  Man who threatened to murder Rand Paul's children is an Obama-supporting Berkeley resident.
[02:21:56.808 --> 02:22:07.071]  And again, he's wearing women's glasses, he looks like, you know, he probably couldn't bench press 50 pounds, but he talks about, I'm gonna kidnap, I'm gonna murder your children, I'm gonna cut their guts out, then I'm gonna murder you.
[02:22:07.392 --> 02:22:08.652]  He's facing 10 years in prison.
[02:22:08.672 --> 02:22:10.393]  Turns out on his Twitter, I went and looked up his Twitter.
[02:22:11.373 --> 02:22:13.914]  He was in there for weeks threatening all the Republicans.
[02:22:13.934 --> 02:22:15.114]  He goes, look at my hit list.
[02:22:15.594 --> 02:22:17.455]  I've death-threatened all these people.
[02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:22.361]  So, finally, Rand Paul has been shot at with Scalise.
[02:22:23.021 --> 02:22:26.482]  He has been six of his ribs broken, a lung punctured.
[02:22:26.502 --> 02:22:30.043]  You know how painful that is for six weeks when you've had ribs broken?
[02:22:30.083 --> 02:22:30.423]  I've had it.
[02:22:30.563 --> 02:22:31.103]  Nothing like that.
[02:22:31.123 --> 02:22:32.244]  Never had a lung punctured.
[02:22:32.744 --> 02:22:36.745]  I mean, that guy caved him in, attacked him, jumped up and down on him, tried to kill him.
[02:22:37.965 --> 02:22:39.466]  Okay, and he's not even getting in hardly any trouble.
[02:22:40.506 --> 02:22:44.127]  And now this guy wants to kill him, and then Rand Paul's actually a libertarian anti-war guy.
[02:22:44.367 --> 02:22:46.948]  The left's so crazed, they don't even know who to hate.
[02:22:47.768 --> 02:22:50.250]  So, it's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:50.350 --> 02:23:01.898]  So getting back to Joey Gibson, Joey, describe what it's like when these cowards come up with metal batons, really trying to kill you, and then folks are knocking them out with one punch, and then the rest of the cowards run.
[02:23:02.058 --> 02:23:05.060]  They're so tough, till one of them gets hit, they all turn and run.
[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:06.281]  The definition of scum.
[02:23:08.095 --> 02:23:08.896]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:09.256 --> 02:23:15.000]  And that's why it's really important that we unite, we come together, we come together in mass numbers and just have each other's backs.
[02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:21.225]  Because the only way they can really win is if we break, you know, we fall apart, we divide, we get people to go off on their own.
[02:23:21.585 --> 02:23:27.209]  And that's exactly what happened at Hayley's Addams Family, which they had the courage to do it, but they crossed the street wearing MAGA hats.
[02:23:27.649 --> 02:23:29.490]  Which that's their right to do, you know?
[02:23:30.191 --> 02:23:36.375]  They went across the street and they confronted Antifa and then they just started attacking her father, her mother, her sister.
[02:23:36.415 --> 02:23:40.038]  They held down Haley and stole their property right in front of the police.
[02:23:40.118 --> 02:23:41.239]  And so, they'll do that.
[02:23:41.299 --> 02:23:42.279]  They'll act real tough.
[02:23:42.319 --> 02:23:47.323]  There's a lot of them who act tough, but the second they gotta go toe-to-toe with any patriot, man, they start running.
[02:23:47.363 --> 02:23:49.885]  You know, they get one punch and they're done.
[02:23:49.945 --> 02:23:54.988]  And so, you know, unfortunately, the only thing they can do is try to find a victim, someone who can't defend themselves.
[02:23:56.169 --> 02:23:56.870]  Well, I know this.
[02:23:59.531 --> 02:24:03.032]  I've seen the videos of them coming up and attacking women in strollers and stuff.
[02:24:03.412 --> 02:24:04.713]  These women need to be packing, man.
[02:24:05.013 --> 02:24:07.054]  Thugs start assaulting women, they need to defend themselves.
[02:24:08.874 --> 02:24:09.615]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:10.115 --> 02:24:11.415]  Will Johnson, what do you say to that?
[02:24:13.236 --> 02:24:16.517]  You know, we shouldn't have to be afraid to go out as Americans.
[02:24:17.097 --> 02:24:21.839]  Every time we have a rally, a conservative rally, a Christian rally, a pro-Trump rally,
[02:24:22.612 --> 02:24:35.118]  Every single time, nine times out of ten, we will get Antifa, BLM, BAM, and now the Brown Berets in California to be aggressive to us, to attack us, simply because we respect the American flag.
[02:24:35.158 --> 02:24:36.558]  We'll stand to the national anthem.
[02:24:37.038 --> 02:24:40.440]  This fighting is all due to the Democrats.
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:44.482]  And I'm calling the Democrats domestic terrorists.
[02:24:44.902 --> 02:24:47.923]  They are 100% domestic terrorist group in the United States.
[02:24:47.943 --> 02:24:49.504]  You have Maxine Waters calling
[02:24:50.410 --> 02:24:54.331]  For violence towards conservatives, anyone who's on the Trump administration.
[02:24:54.731 --> 02:25:00.693]  Can you imagine had this happened if Obama was in office and you had a Republican do this?
[02:25:01.634 --> 02:25:06.495]  If a Republican was saying rise up, surround them, beat people up, I'd say hell no.
[02:25:06.836 --> 02:25:08.196]  I mean, exactly.
[02:25:09.056 --> 02:25:09.977]  They call us Nazis.
[02:25:10.237 --> 02:25:12.557]  This is exactly how Hitler came to power with the brown shirts.
[02:25:12.798 --> 02:25:13.978]  They did this exact same thing.
[02:25:15.171 --> 02:25:16.031]  Yes, exactly.
[02:25:16.332 --> 02:25:18.693]  And we have to experience this every single time.
[02:25:18.753 --> 02:25:20.274]  We're 100% peaceful.
[02:25:20.674 --> 02:25:22.955]  We were at Joey's Rally and 100% peaceful.
[02:25:23.015 --> 02:25:23.915]  Everyone getting along.
[02:25:23.996 --> 02:25:26.657]  It wasn't until we went out in the streets to where we had.
[02:25:28.499 --> 02:25:28.979]  Amazing.
[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:41.285]  Cameras don't catch it all, but describe what it's like when these antifa come up and try to basically kill you with metal pipes and are swinging for the fences, and then one of them gets hit and they all run.
[02:25:41.305 --> 02:25:42.326]  I mean, what is that like?
[02:25:42.706 --> 02:25:45.908]  Because it looks very exhilarating when the guy just... I want to give that guy an award.
[02:25:46.268 --> 02:25:49.369]  Do we know who that guy is that just cold-cocked that guy that tried to kill him with a club?
[02:25:49.389 --> 02:25:52.411]  I mean, that is just... that's the real deal right there.
[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:56.362]  Yeah, that's Rufio.
[02:25:56.402 --> 02:25:57.084]  He's a proud boy.
[02:25:57.284 --> 02:26:00.151]  He's in Washington, up in the Seattle area.
[02:26:00.942 --> 02:26:03.343]  Real big dude, works out all the time, and he has a big heart.
[02:26:03.403 --> 02:26:04.224]  He's a really good guy.
[02:26:04.824 --> 02:26:12.327]  And we appreciate him standing in there and sticking up for all the people who are marching, you know, the women and the elderly, and just standing up like a real man.
[02:26:12.347 --> 02:26:14.748]  That's the spirit that we got to have in this country.
[02:26:14.929 --> 02:26:15.329]  I agree.
[02:26:15.649 --> 02:26:16.990]  I want to get him on, because let me say this.
[02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:20.191]  Notice it took one man to stand up to those thugs.
[02:26:20.231 --> 02:26:20.731]  They all ran.
[02:26:21.151 --> 02:26:21.552]  One man.
[02:26:22.072 --> 02:26:25.714]  They're all up there sticking their chest out with their clubs, with their maces, with their weapons.
[02:26:25.774 --> 02:26:29.055]  It took one guy to stand up and knock them upside the head, and they all ran.
[02:26:29.155 --> 02:26:30.416]  I mean, isn't that archetypal?
[02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:33.650]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:34.090 --> 02:26:38.834]  And it really represents, you know, that's the true American spirit right there, right?
[02:26:39.255 --> 02:26:40.616]  It's about, it's no fear.
[02:26:40.876 --> 02:26:42.437]  It's just standing up for what you believe in.
[02:26:42.738 --> 02:26:45.540]  And that's what the whole rally was about at the Freedom and Courage Rally.
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:51.545]  It's about, you know, it takes courage to really stand up for freedom, to get freedom, and that's it right there.
[02:26:51.985 --> 02:26:59.171]  It represents it, and to just see him stand up to him, and he had no hesitation, and that's what I love, and that's what I appreciate it, and it was completely justified.
[02:26:59.231 --> 02:27:00.192]  It's all self-defense.
[02:27:00.752 --> 02:27:03.715]  And so, you know, he pretty much became a hero overnight.
[02:27:03.735 --> 02:27:04.216]  That's right.
[02:27:04.256 --> 02:27:05.057]  You should have seen him.
[02:27:05.397 --> 02:27:06.659]  He drove back with us to the bar.
[02:27:06.879 --> 02:27:11.243]  He walked up to the bar and the whole bar just started chanting his name because it was all over the country.
[02:27:11.364 --> 02:27:12.445]  And again, say his name again.
[02:27:13.703 --> 02:27:14.504]  His name's Rufio.
[02:27:15.124 --> 02:27:15.745]  Ethan Rufio.
[02:27:16.185 --> 02:27:17.646]  We need to get him on ASAP.
[02:27:17.686 --> 02:27:19.428]  And it's not because he attacked somebody.
[02:27:19.748 --> 02:27:23.572]  He stood up to five or six guys waving weapons at him, and then they all turned and ran.
[02:27:24.012 --> 02:27:24.853]  That's what it's all about.
[02:27:24.913 --> 02:27:26.014]  It's not striking first.
[02:27:26.634 --> 02:27:27.895]  And that's my big concern, guys.
[02:27:28.035 --> 02:27:37.424]  I'm worried they've been caught, you know, obviously trying to stage that whole clash with the police ordering the new right folks, that I don't agree with a lot of what they have to say, into the Antifa scum.
[02:27:38.104 --> 02:27:39.024]  Yeah, I completely agree with you.
[02:27:39.044 --> 02:27:43.746]  When we were walking down, Portland Police, they actually saw Antifa and the American supporters, I like to call them.
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:00.421]  Facing off.
[02:28:00.861 --> 02:28:03.143]  And they did nothing to prevent what took place.
[02:28:03.603 --> 02:28:05.644]  You know, we are in a civil war.
[02:28:05.764 --> 02:28:09.567]  It's not a hot civil war, but the Democrats are pushing for a racial division.
[02:28:09.947 --> 02:28:11.288]  They're pushing for a racial war.
[02:28:11.669 --> 02:28:16.672]  And my main goal is to stop that because we should not be fighting each other based on one's complexion.
[02:28:17.192 --> 02:28:19.914]  They are literally trying to destroy the United States.
[02:28:19.954 --> 02:28:20.815]  They're so bitter.
[02:28:20.835 --> 02:28:23.517]  They're so angry because Donald J. Trump is the president.
[02:28:23.917 --> 02:28:26.981]  And every time we have these rallies, we have to be on the guard.
[02:28:27.401 --> 02:28:39.115]  People, women come out with helmets on, come out with full metal jacket gear on, because they want to avoid the violence with these Antifa domestic terrorists that's the foot soldiers for the Democratic Party.
[02:28:39.636 --> 02:28:42.780]  Every single time, every single day, we see this from the left.
[02:28:44.269 --> 02:28:46.071]  That's right, and they're getting ready to launch their big attack.
[02:28:46.111 --> 02:28:47.313]  You can feel it, you can see it.
[02:28:47.653 --> 02:28:50.236]  One of our gentlemen's running for Senate, not just launching these prayer vigils.
[02:28:50.656 --> 02:28:52.879]  Our other friend's going up and down the West Coast exposing all this.
[02:28:53.199 --> 02:28:54.641]  Your calls and more are straight ahead.
[02:28:54.921 --> 02:28:56.923]  History's happening, the battle's happening now.
[02:28:57.424 --> 02:28:59.166]  Joey Gibson and Will Johnson, straight ahead.
[02:29:03.035 --> 02:29:04.977]  This 4th of July is special.
[02:29:04.997 --> 02:29:06.478]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[02:29:06.979 --> 02:29:11.123]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[02:29:11.423 --> 02:29:15.066]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance, the globalists.
[02:29:15.807 --> 02:29:20.872]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[02:29:20.892 --> 02:29:24.655]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[02:29:25.496 --> 02:29:27.357]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[02:29:27.777 --> 02:29:29.638]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[02:29:29.718 --> 02:29:32.839]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[02:29:32.879 --> 02:29:39.542]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[02:29:40.022 --> 02:29:41.883]  We have record sales going on right now.
[02:29:42.890 --> 02:29:44.912]  Free shipping on hundreds of different items.
[02:29:45.252 --> 02:29:48.235]  More than 20 items are 50% off, like Brain Force Plus.
[02:29:48.996 --> 02:29:50.017]  X2 is 40% off.
[02:29:50.437 --> 02:29:52.279]  Knockout Sleep Aid, $17.76.
[02:29:52.679 --> 02:29:55.201]  Silver Bullets, $9.95, a little silver.
[02:29:55.942 --> 02:29:57.664]  And free shipping, you can't beat that.
[02:29:57.984 --> 02:30:01.027]  This Fourth of July is special, and our sales are special to match it.
[02:30:01.227 --> 02:30:02.308]  Infowarrestore.com.
[02:30:05.762 --> 02:30:08.645]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[02:30:08.905 --> 02:30:13.870]  But these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever, ever meet.
[02:30:14.511 --> 02:30:16.513]  But we're gonna punch through the media.
[02:30:16.773 --> 02:30:17.234]  We have to!
[02:30:19.537 --> 02:30:24.522]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[02:30:25.083 --> 02:30:29.827]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[02:30:30.688 --> 02:30:31.869]  We will not fail.
[02:30:32.730 --> 02:30:35.573]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[02:30:36.254 --> 02:30:37.655]  That whether we are black
[02:30:39.797 --> 02:30:50.364]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[02:30:51.245 --> 02:30:52.846]  Victory for the world.
[02:31:05.316 --> 02:31:06.937]  Well, I've been wanting to get this lady on for a while.
[02:31:06.957 --> 02:31:08.338]  We're going to her in about a minute.
[02:31:09.118 --> 02:31:11.560]  Katie Hopkins over in the UK, but she's in the US a lot.
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:12.901]  Banned off Twitter.
[02:31:14.041 --> 02:31:15.102]  They want her kicked off TV.
[02:31:15.222 --> 02:31:18.584]  Another reason I wanted to get her on is the assassination of Katie Hopkins.
[02:31:18.845 --> 02:31:22.607]  State-sponsored national theater opening in a Welsh area.
[02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:25.649]  And it's about killing her, and she's had an attempt on her life.
[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:27.351]  So, this is next level.
[02:31:27.431 --> 02:31:33.296]  And they want you dead because you're powerful, you're vibrant, and I'm married, but I gotta say, you are pretty sexy.
[02:31:33.336 --> 02:31:42.424]  Well, if you think I'm sexy, I will say I think you need your eyes tested, but I do think strong women are really fun to be around, and the reason my government is sponsoring a play for you... Well, that's what I'm saying.
[02:31:42.504 --> 02:31:43.505]  Look, I don't think you look bad.
[02:31:43.525 --> 02:31:45.567]  My point is, it's attitudes what matters.
[02:31:46.348 --> 02:31:47.869]  You have light in your eyes.
[02:31:48.109 --> 02:31:48.970]  You have light in your eyes.
[02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:54.193]  I watched all these feminists that were at this feminist meeting with Hillary yesterday, and they look like they're zombies.
[02:31:54.373 --> 02:31:55.514]  It's not that they're even ugly.
[02:31:55.694 --> 02:31:57.896]  They look like something sucked their soul.
[02:31:58.076 --> 02:32:06.701]  The reason the state wants to run the play called the assassination of Katie Hopkins is because it would be much more convenient for them if that were true.
[02:32:07.162 --> 02:32:09.203]  One of the things the state loves is fear.
[02:32:09.423 --> 02:32:11.365]  They can control people when they're afraid.
[02:32:11.705 --> 02:32:17.829]  When you have someone like me who is not afraid of anyone, not the establishment, not the state, that's far more dangerous.
[02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:21.132]  And they would be much better for them if I wasn't around.
[02:32:21.152 --> 02:32:29.499]  So we had two jihadis sent down earlier this year because they had practiced beheading me with a dummy, with a plastic hunting, with a plastic dummy and a hunting knife.
[02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:31.922]  So the threat against my life is real.
[02:32:32.202 --> 02:32:34.764]  And now the state is sponsoring a play called exactly that.
[02:32:34.804 --> 02:32:36.726]  What would happen if I got a poster with
[02:32:36.966 --> 02:32:38.987]  The assassination of Sadiq Khan.
[02:32:39.388 --> 02:32:41.489]  Or the assassination of a black politician.
[02:32:41.729 --> 02:32:43.250]  How would that go down, do you think?
[02:32:43.450 --> 02:32:45.652]  Oh, it would be the biggest hissy fit the planet ever saw.
[02:32:45.792 --> 02:32:46.192]  Absolutely.
[02:32:46.232 --> 02:32:48.134]  I would be banned from everything within a moment.
[02:32:48.194 --> 02:32:56.199]  Because it's the assassination of white, Christian, conservative woman who's passionate about her country and passionate about people's right to stand up for their country.
[02:32:56.619 --> 02:33:00.562]  It's seen as acceptable and, in fact, wildly amusing for the liberal elite.
[02:33:06.107 --> 02:33:09.128]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:09.828 --> 02:33:32.993]  And it all crashes down And you break your crown And you put your finger But there's no one around Just one more thing Just to play the king But the castles crumble And you're left with just a name Where's your crown, king?
[02:33:33.013 --> 02:33:33.393]  Nothing
[02:33:34.986 --> 02:33:38.868]  Bill Johnson of UnitedAmericaFirst.com and Joey Gibson, GibsonForFreedom.com.
[02:33:39.448 --> 02:33:47.171]  You know, you got people that are taught by the media that your hero should be football players or basketball players, and I like a football game or a basketball game, and I'm sorry.
[02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:55.215]  Roger Stalback, Terry Bradshaw, LeBron James, Muhammad Ali, those are not my heroes.
[02:33:56.636 --> 02:33:56.936]  Okay?
[02:33:57.756 --> 02:34:01.898]  They're interesting, you can admire them for their prowess, great, but it's moral courage.
[02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:11.166]  And standing up against the peer pressure, and the attacks, and the demonizations, and the threats, and being shot at, and having your ribs broken, and being shot.
[02:34:11.986 --> 02:34:13.067]  And I'm not bitching hell out.
[02:34:13.247 --> 02:34:14.428]  People say, man, how do you take all this?
[02:34:14.448 --> 02:34:15.329]  Well, these are bad people.
[02:34:16.029 --> 02:34:17.430]  I'm fighting them because I know they're bad.
[02:34:17.470 --> 02:34:18.591]  Now, they've proven I was right.
[02:34:19.832 --> 02:34:23.054]  But, I mean, at a certain point, you just can't keep rolling over.
[02:34:23.875 --> 02:34:26.997]  But I gotta tell you, I don't like going out around Antifa.
[02:34:27.857 --> 02:34:31.640]  I first learned who they were like 15 years ago, anti-fascist, anti-racist, and a guy
[02:34:33.753 --> 02:34:34.394]  Steve Mason.
[02:34:34.694 --> 02:34:35.455]  He's still in Austin.
[02:34:35.475 --> 02:34:37.736]  He's an interesting guy.
[02:34:38.137 --> 02:34:40.419]  He was a leftist, but he was really an anti-racist.
[02:34:41.219 --> 02:34:44.061]  And when he was going to college up in Maine, he's an older guy.
[02:34:44.081 --> 02:34:45.743]  We should find Steve Mason's number.
[02:34:45.763 --> 02:34:46.363]  I got it somewhere.
[02:34:46.383 --> 02:34:46.884]  Get him in here.
[02:34:46.904 --> 02:34:48.845]  And he was like the preeminent expert.
[02:34:48.885 --> 02:34:50.326]  He had this show called Texas Frontline.
[02:34:51.167 --> 02:34:55.471]  He'd say, the communists are now called the anti-racist, anti-fascist group, blah, blah, blah.
[02:34:55.511 --> 02:34:59.874]  And I would go, those are the guys that always come up and hit me in the back when I'm doing a rally for Second Amendment.
[02:34:59.894 --> 02:35:00.755]  He goes, yeah, yeah, those are them.
[02:35:01.738 --> 02:35:26.494]  And they're like all professors, and they're fun about big banks and all this, and boy was he a trailblazer in writing about this, and he predicted the whole communist underground being prepared, and for in the future they were going to launch all this, and then they were going to collapse the borders for the UN, and the world population operation, and now the UN is saying, we're going to occupy the EU, and we're going to stop nation states stopping tens of millions pouring in,
[02:35:27.859 --> 02:35:29.740]  And they had a plan under Hillary to bring the U.N.
[02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:29.940]  in.
[02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:31.680]  That's in the Associated Press!
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:50.406]  So, when you pull back and see this giant thing they're launching, decades in the making, thank God, populism from South America to areas of Africa to Asia to strong in Eastern Europe, the Brexit and, you know, out in the Atlantic Ocean, all of, it's like humanity isn't getting coordinated.
[02:35:50.426 --> 02:35:51.506]  When the FBI is questioned,
[02:35:52.728 --> 02:35:54.089]  Hundreds of people now about me.
[02:35:54.129 --> 02:35:56.271]  They keep saying, how does Jones know what Trump's going to say?
[02:35:56.311 --> 02:35:58.573]  How does Jones, is Jones talking to Trump every day?
[02:35:59.133 --> 02:36:00.194]  Who's the mastermind?
[02:36:00.354 --> 02:36:01.235]  And they're really doing this.
[02:36:01.275 --> 02:36:01.715]  They don't get it.
[02:36:01.735 --> 02:36:02.476]  It's like a spirit.
[02:36:02.896 --> 02:36:05.658]  They've got their evil spirit, the mystery of evil, the Bible talks about.
[02:36:05.678 --> 02:36:12.083]  I remember reading this when I was a kid and in Bible study, I thought, really, there's like an evil thing that coordinates and that's the mystery of evil, how it works.
[02:36:12.123 --> 02:36:14.005]  And then God's got his own Holy Spirit.
[02:36:14.285 --> 02:36:16.047]  But when you actually get to this level,
[02:36:17.091 --> 02:36:25.573]  It's like we're all coordinated, they're all coordinated, but they're coordinated digitally and with commands and orders and propaganda and also a spirit of hate.
[02:36:25.993 --> 02:36:26.854]  But there's a real spirit.
[02:36:26.874 --> 02:36:30.755]  So since I know both of you guys are Christians, so am I. I'm not some guy up here on a high horse.
[02:36:30.815 --> 02:36:32.075]  I just love God and love Christ.
[02:36:32.855 --> 02:36:33.976]  And that's what gives me my strength.
[02:36:34.376 --> 02:36:35.436]  Joey, you're a Christian.
[02:36:35.476 --> 02:36:39.857]  What makes you, and we're gonna go to calls with both of you guys, what made you understand you had to do this?
[02:36:39.937 --> 02:36:42.618]  I mean, was it a knot in your chest like Will talked about?
[02:36:42.638 --> 02:36:43.458]  Because that's what it is with me.
[02:36:43.478 --> 02:36:45.899]  And then almost like a burning up my spine.
[02:36:46.579 --> 02:36:53.563]  And then in my mind, it's in my gut starts here and then it's like I gotta do something because it's not like I gotta go be a champion or hero.
[02:36:53.623 --> 02:36:55.024]  It's like evil's coming on me.
[02:36:55.044 --> 02:36:56.004]  I gotta do something.
[02:36:56.025 --> 02:36:58.086]  And I've seen Will talk about that feeling.
[02:36:58.586 --> 02:36:59.727]  You know evil when you see it.
[02:36:59.747 --> 02:37:01.808]  Can you speak to the spiritual element of this?
[02:37:02.841 --> 02:37:06.262]  Yeah, actually Alex, a big part of this story has to do with you.
[02:37:07.202 --> 02:37:09.643]  I've always been awake in terms of the corruption in our government.
[02:37:10.143 --> 02:37:16.925]  I've always been a libertarian constitutionalist and I started to listen to you for a while and I really, you know, I watched a lot of your shows.
[02:37:16.945 --> 02:37:24.828]  The one thing you kept pushing is that you can't just listen to your show, you have to go out and participate and you kept pushing that and pushing that and pushing that and it really spoke to me.
[02:37:25.388 --> 02:37:30.069]  And what had happened is a bunch of people got beat up in San Jose when they're leaving a Trump rally.
[02:37:30.429 --> 02:37:31.710]  And at that point, I was done.
[02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:33.330]  Like, I was done sitting in my house.
[02:37:33.370 --> 02:37:34.290]  I didn't know what I was going to do.
[02:37:34.650 --> 02:37:36.291]  But I'm going to go out there and participate.
[02:37:36.351 --> 02:37:39.171]  And it was a spiritual journey for me.
[02:37:39.611 --> 02:37:44.813]  And the first thing I did is I booked my tickets and I went down to Cleveland to the RNC, which you were at.
[02:37:44.873 --> 02:37:45.973]  And I went to your rally.
[02:37:46.353 --> 02:37:47.153]  I heard you speak.
[02:37:47.173 --> 02:37:48.074]  You know, I shook your hand.
[02:37:48.614 --> 02:37:53.835]  And I came back home a completely different person and just completely committed to making change in this culture.
[02:37:54.355 --> 02:38:02.104]  The one thing I said in my speech is that if you see evil clear as day, which I was seeing, and you do nothing and you say nothing, then you're just as much to blame.
[02:38:02.464 --> 02:38:03.766]  So I refuse to stand down.
[02:38:04.306 --> 02:38:05.368]  That's pretty much it right there.
[02:38:05.448 --> 02:38:06.829]  That's beautiful.
[02:38:06.869 --> 02:38:08.051]  Tell us your story, Will.
[02:38:09.492 --> 02:38:11.515]  You know, I truly believe we're in a civil war.
[02:38:11.855 --> 02:38:13.497]  And I have to admit to something.
[02:38:14.754 --> 02:38:18.658]  Brainforce actually works for people who don't realize it.
[02:38:18.678 --> 02:38:19.519]  I mean, it actually works.
[02:38:19.539 --> 02:38:26.346]  So when I would go to these rallies, I would pop to Brainforce and I was just right on it every single time, knocking them out.
[02:38:26.426 --> 02:38:27.967]  The liberals are confronting them.
[02:38:27.987 --> 02:38:30.049]  The Brainforce absolutely works.
[02:38:30.530 --> 02:38:31.791]  I can say it firsthand.
[02:38:32.945 --> 02:38:35.967]  But this spiritual war that we're in, it is a battle.
[02:38:36.347 --> 02:38:43.671]  And just like Joey said, I used to listen to you, you said, people, you've got to speak up, you've got to do your own video, do your own podcast, do those, do those.
[02:38:44.432 --> 02:38:50.736]  And that knot, because you were doing that, that knot actually just got bigger in my chest and I had to speak out.
[02:38:51.056 --> 02:38:54.538]  So I'm in complete agreement with Joey and what you just said.
[02:38:55.575 --> 02:38:58.737]  And the reason we tell those stories is that's all happened to us at one time or another.
[02:38:58.757 --> 02:39:02.140]  And then you guys inspire me, I inspire you, we all inspire each other.
[02:39:02.460 --> 02:39:10.305]  And then we show, like when we had the rally, our rally at Cleveland, I was so proud that more than half that crowd wasn't white.
[02:39:10.786 --> 02:39:17.150]  And that everybody loved each other, everybody was hugging, they were Hispanic, black folks, Asians, white guys, white bikers, you know.
[02:39:18.391 --> 02:39:22.194]  You know, guys with their Iron Cross tattoos on their arms, you know, hugging black folks.
[02:39:22.555 --> 02:39:25.957]  And I see Trump and the Tea Party and all this healing.
[02:39:26.398 --> 02:39:29.861]  It's actually the most loving place you can go is to a Tea Party event or a Trump event.
[02:39:30.101 --> 02:39:31.062]  That is the most open.
[02:39:31.382 --> 02:39:32.483]  People have light in their eyes.
[02:39:32.523 --> 02:39:33.043]  They're good.
[02:39:33.083 --> 02:39:35.525]  You go to a leftist event, again, I'm not putting them down.
[02:39:35.565 --> 02:39:37.787]  They look like somebody sucked their soul.
[02:39:38.148 --> 02:39:39.549]  This is spiritual is what I'm saying.
[02:39:41.081 --> 02:39:41.601]  Exactly.
[02:39:41.641 --> 02:39:50.667]  When I went to the Kevin de Leon and I confronted him about why is he putting illegals before the American people, I was the only black male in the room.
[02:39:51.008 --> 02:39:54.350]  And then they all looked demonic and they all started attacking me.
[02:39:54.430 --> 02:39:56.791]  They were yelling at me saying it's not true.
[02:39:57.091 --> 02:40:00.674]  And it is absolutely true that he's putting the illegals before the American citizen.
[02:40:00.914 --> 02:40:05.537]  That's why we're in a predicament that we're in right now with the borders and with the immigration situation.
[02:40:06.369 --> 02:40:12.011]  This war that we're in is not just about left and right Democrats and Republicans.
[02:40:12.151 --> 02:40:13.572]  It is a spiritual war.
[02:40:13.952 --> 02:40:18.874]  And they're trying to create, they're trying to bring this war that we're having to a hot war in America.
[02:40:18.894 --> 02:40:23.696]  And I truly believe, like I said before, we are in the second civil war in this nation.
[02:40:24.315 --> 02:40:31.503]  I agree, and you've been saying that for a year that I've seen your videos, and as we cross over, I think they're trying to go hot right now, but none of them want to get the full blame.
[02:40:32.284 --> 02:40:35.447]  Moore's willing to say it, Maxine, and the way I respect them is they're willing to say it.
[02:40:36.228 --> 02:40:39.091]  But they're really, I see them launching it right now.
[02:40:39.351 --> 02:40:41.614]  The numbers are pouring in, the attacks are all over the place.
[02:40:43.157 --> 02:40:44.338]  Yes, they are.
[02:40:44.358 --> 02:40:56.648]  I mean, Maxine Waters gave the okay to Antifa, BAM, BLM, and the Brown Berets, or anybody who doesn't agree with the Trump administration, to go out and attack them, to approach them.
[02:40:57.068 --> 02:41:03.534]  When they're simply having dinner with their families, they're saying, heckle them, be aggressive towards them, attack them where they are.
[02:41:03.994 --> 02:41:07.977]  It sounds to me like the Islamic terrorists attack the infidels where they are.
[02:41:08.057 --> 02:41:08.478]  That's right.
[02:41:10.479 --> 02:41:15.565]  MSNBC has a host I played earlier saying, Oh, Sarah Sanders gets a life sentence.
[02:41:15.625 --> 02:41:17.126]  She's not allowed to be comfortable anywhere.
[02:41:17.547 --> 02:41:18.688]  Chase her down everywhere.
[02:41:18.748 --> 02:41:20.931]  I mean, that is, that is so brown shirt.
[02:41:22.637 --> 02:41:22.897]  It is 100%.
[02:41:22.937 --> 02:41:30.462]  They complain and say that Trump is the neo-Nazi supporter, that he's a white supremacist.
[02:41:30.742 --> 02:41:35.065]  Both Joey and I were called white supremacists by Nancy Pelosi.
[02:41:36.886 --> 02:41:41.569]  Everything that they do, that they say they're against, that's exactly what they do.
[02:41:42.329 --> 02:41:43.610]  It's unbelievable.
[02:41:45.571 --> 02:41:46.672]  I can feel the energy.
[02:41:46.692 --> 02:41:48.633]  I mean, they're losing, but they're freaking out.
[02:41:49.053 --> 02:41:51.375]  I think in the next few weeks, I think we're going to see some real violence.
[02:41:53.087 --> 02:41:53.567]  I agree.
[02:41:53.608 --> 02:41:54.048]  You know what?
[02:41:54.448 --> 02:41:58.151]  That's why I'm constantly screaming, we have to vote them out.
[02:41:58.351 --> 02:42:01.534]  Because if we don't vote them out in 2018, we all lose.
[02:42:01.634 --> 02:42:03.315]  It doesn't matter if you're Republican, Democrat.
[02:42:03.335 --> 02:42:04.416]  And Will, you made a great point.
[02:42:04.456 --> 02:42:09.080]  They've proven they're a criminal, globalist, CHICOM-funded organization that wants to overthrow the country.
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:11.682]  We have to get rid of the Democratic Party and create a new party.
[02:42:12.863 --> 02:42:13.323]  Absolutely.
[02:42:13.363 --> 02:42:15.605]  The Democratic Party is a domestic terrorist group.
[02:42:15.845 --> 02:42:17.226]  They're promoting violence.
[02:42:18.532 --> 02:42:23.958]  100%.
[02:42:18.912 --> 02:42:23.958]  Their foot soldiers is Antifa, BLM, BAM, and the Brown Berets.
[02:42:23.978 --> 02:42:23.958]  100%.
[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:25.600]  Wow.
[02:42:26.521 --> 02:42:27.222]  Joey, we're going to break.
[02:42:27.242 --> 02:42:27.883]  You want to say something?
[02:42:28.723 --> 02:42:29.604]  Yeah, something real quick.
[02:42:29.644 --> 02:42:32.647]  Just, uh, I know we don't have much time, but we gotta break through the lies.
[02:42:32.727 --> 02:42:37.972]  There's this attempt to make us think that there's not conservatives out there, there's not this huge shit.
[02:42:38.092 --> 02:42:39.794]  One thing we can do is show up in the streets.
[02:42:40.334 --> 02:42:45.639]  August 4th, we're going back into Portland, and the safest thing we can do is to just bring thousands of people.
[02:42:45.659 --> 02:42:46.160]  I agree.
[02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:47.882]  August 4th, we're gonna send reporters.
[02:42:47.922 --> 02:42:48.843]  Hell, I might even come.
[02:42:49.423 --> 02:42:52.506]  They've just got me pinned down here with stuff you wouldn't believe.
[02:42:52.907 --> 02:42:53.588]  I'm not complaining.
[02:42:53.628 --> 02:42:54.549]  I expected this to happen.
[02:42:54.629 --> 02:42:55.910]  Good God, these people are dirty.
[02:42:56.351 --> 02:42:58.253]  They are on my butt, let me tell you.
[02:42:58.293 --> 02:42:59.454]  They're going after everybody in my family.
[02:42:59.754 --> 02:43:00.175]  We'll be back.
[02:43:02.082 --> 02:43:05.665]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[02:43:06.085 --> 02:43:08.507]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[02:43:08.808 --> 02:43:13.191]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.

[02:44:05.006 --> 02:44:09.068]  What you're about to see are two presidents of the teachers union.
[02:44:09.208 --> 02:44:11.930]  One guy named Dave Perry in Trenton, New Jersey.
[02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:15.292]  Another named Kathleen Valencia in Union City, New Jersey.
[02:44:15.312 --> 02:44:19.434]  And they're talking about covering up child abusers in the public schools.
[02:44:20.115 --> 02:44:22.716]  Dave Perry, the statements he makes are so shocking.
[02:44:22.776 --> 02:44:26.398]  He actually says, we want to turn it back around onto the child.
[02:44:26.418 --> 02:44:27.439]  He says, it's my job.
[02:44:28.039 --> 02:44:32.443]  He says, I'm going to backdate it, that's commit fraud after the incident of abuse.
[02:44:32.903 --> 02:44:34.885]  He says that's his job at the teachers union.
[02:44:34.925 --> 02:44:36.966]  He's there to protect the worst people.
[02:44:37.467 --> 02:44:38.588]  He's there to bend the truth.
[02:44:39.108 --> 02:44:40.810]  And he's there to reverse it back onto the kid.
[02:44:40.830 --> 02:44:44.833]  There's me confronting Dave Perry, who denied the things he said.
[02:44:44.873 --> 02:44:45.954]  Now last night, Alex,
[02:44:46.814 --> 02:44:53.479]  The National Education Association and the NJEA, that's the New Jersey version of it, has suspended him.
[02:44:53.579 --> 02:45:02.104]  So they've suspended one union president and then just today, Alex, we released another woman in New Jersey saying that she was protecting child abuse.
[02:45:02.184 --> 02:45:03.725]  But I don't want him coming here with a bunch of lies.
[02:45:03.785 --> 02:45:06.127]  I need to know the truth so that we can bend the truth.
[02:45:06.867 --> 02:45:06.967]  Okay.
[02:45:06.987 --> 02:45:07.848]  Yeah, like a physical skirmish.
[02:45:22.938 --> 02:45:25.740]  I'm gonna date it back to the day after the incident.
[02:45:26.341 --> 02:45:26.781]  Okay.
[02:45:26.821 --> 02:45:27.782]  He was upset.
[02:45:27.802 --> 02:45:28.482]  He was worried.
[02:45:28.823 --> 02:45:29.903]  He did shake the kid.
[02:45:30.144 --> 02:45:34.147]  So if they said there was bruises he had, there was bruises where, I gotta ask him where he, where he hit him.
[02:45:34.567 --> 02:45:35.067]  Uh-huh.
[02:45:35.087 --> 02:45:37.869]  Yeah, because he was trying to put him back in his seat because he was getting physical.
[02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:38.690]  It was tough.
[02:45:38.990 --> 02:45:40.611]  We reverse it onto the kid.
[02:45:41.292 --> 02:45:41.752]  Okay, yeah.
[02:45:41.772 --> 02:45:42.433]  That's my job.
[02:45:42.453 --> 02:45:46.176]  It's, it's not a, it's not a good job, but it's my job and what I have to do.
[02:45:46.396 --> 02:45:50.079]  This file right here is from a teacher who had sex with a student.
[02:45:50.219 --> 02:45:50.719]  Okay?
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:54.342]  You're not going to jail.
[02:45:54.782 --> 02:45:58.665]  You know what this whole file is about?
[02:45:59.266 --> 02:46:01.267]  It's about whether or not they get to keep their pension.
[02:46:02.188 --> 02:46:08.813]  Sex with a teenage girl.
[02:46:08.893 --> 02:46:09.814]  Is it going to jail?
[02:46:11.835 --> 02:46:12.055]  No.
[02:46:12.696 --> 02:46:15.198]  I'm being as brutally honest with you as I can.
[02:46:16.025 --> 02:46:24.556]  If you are afraid of a middle school child who called you a d*** and spit on you and advanced towards you, you are in the wrong profession.
[02:46:24.576 --> 02:46:25.197]  Kid's fine.
[02:46:26.138 --> 02:46:26.638]  Kid's not hurt.
[02:46:26.658 --> 02:46:27.980]  I think he got a scratch.
[02:46:28.581 --> 02:46:30.003]  He's gonna give the kid a 65, right?
[02:46:32.563 --> 02:46:34.304]  He's not gonna fail the kid?
[02:46:34.344 --> 02:46:34.764]  No, no.
[02:46:34.804 --> 02:46:36.345]  No, he's not gonna fail the kid?
[02:46:36.965 --> 02:46:42.127]  He's gonna get that kid out of his f***ing classroom and move on fresh for September.
[02:46:42.707 --> 02:46:47.630]  We're facing a crisis in American education, and this week, the NJEA is under fire.
[02:46:48.110 --> 02:46:51.071]  Teachers unions would have you believe that they're fighting for our children.
[02:46:51.571 --> 02:46:57.354]  But the evidence in these tapes show they're fighting for themselves, their survival, and their own dominance.
[02:47:05.569 --> 02:47:11.792]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:28.481 --> 02:47:30.582]  I've got a big announcement here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:30.602 --> 02:47:32.003]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[02:47:32.684 --> 02:47:32.984]  You saw
[02:47:34.727 --> 02:47:43.171]  Dan Rather come out and, you know, demonize me and attack what we're doing here at Infowars and call us fake news.
[02:47:43.211 --> 02:47:44.511]  But, you know, he's the fake news.
[02:47:44.631 --> 02:47:50.534]  And he also recently came out and said that Trump is mean like a wolverine.
[02:47:50.634 --> 02:47:52.295]  So earlier this week I said, hey,
[02:47:52.955 --> 02:47:55.777]  Let's put out Trump as a Wolverine.
[02:47:56.257 --> 02:47:59.159]  MeanLikeAWolverineInfoWars.com.
[02:47:59.499 --> 02:48:01.180]  Beautiful new red shirt.
[02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:03.762]  Incredible job with the graphics crew.
[02:48:04.202 --> 02:48:06.643]  They are amazing.
[02:48:06.663 --> 02:48:06.643]  1995.
[02:48:06.803 --> 02:48:07.764]  High quality shirt.
[02:48:08.164 --> 02:48:10.045]  It's being printed right now.
[02:48:10.145 --> 02:48:11.666]  They'll be shipping out next week.
[02:48:12.127 --> 02:48:13.287]  Get your order in.
[02:48:13.347 --> 02:48:14.508]  This is a limited edition.
[02:48:14.588 --> 02:48:16.869]  This needs to be the new viral shirt.
[02:48:17.310 --> 02:48:17.450]  Now!
[02:48:19.457 --> 02:48:23.860]  I think on another idea today, and we've got printing right here in Texas now, so we can get this by next week as well.
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:25.801]  I just put in a giant order.
[02:48:27.222 --> 02:48:30.924]  Because I saw Walmart boycott launched over Impeach 45 clothing.
[02:48:32.025 --> 02:48:33.646]  Don't boycott Walmart over that.
[02:48:33.826 --> 02:48:34.686]  Just say Walmart.
[02:48:35.927 --> 02:48:37.228]  I don't care if they copy our shirt.
[02:48:37.328 --> 02:48:38.469]  Put out a reelect 45.
[02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:41.691]  You know, let's engage in that.
[02:48:43.772 --> 02:48:44.893]  So, they've got their Impeach45.
[02:48:45.093 --> 02:48:47.254]  You go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:48:47.274 --> 02:48:52.977]  We have Reelect45 with an American flag, very triggering, on the right arm and on the back.
[02:48:53.417 --> 02:48:54.538]  Infowars.com.
[02:48:55.258 --> 02:48:57.900]  I am the resistance.
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:01.221]  I am the resistance.
[02:49:02.522 --> 02:49:04.343]  This, I mean, these shirts have just been hitting me.
[02:49:04.403 --> 02:49:05.784]  And I knew Hillary for President.
[02:49:06.604 --> 02:49:09.626]  I saw a handmade sign in a yard.
[02:49:11.115 --> 02:49:13.937]  About, you know, like three years before the election.
[02:49:13.977 --> 02:49:15.218]  It was, it was, they knew she'd run.
[02:49:15.238 --> 02:49:18.420]  It was like, and then I remember thinking, or two years before, I thought, we've got to do that.
[02:49:18.500 --> 02:49:22.042]  And it, we went to the RNC and a third of the people were wearing it.
[02:49:22.082 --> 02:49:22.863]  It was the chance.
[02:49:23.904 --> 02:49:26.585]  It was, we had planes flying around saying it, you know, behind them.
[02:49:26.625 --> 02:49:27.326]  It was incredible.
[02:49:27.386 --> 02:49:28.146]  It was a magic moment.
[02:49:28.667 --> 02:49:30.448]  And I know when something's going to be a hit.
[02:49:31.108 --> 02:49:38.013]  So they've got their impeach 45, reelect 45, baseball shirt style, white, blue, and red, red, white, and blue.
[02:49:38.253 --> 02:49:40.295]  And then black on white, I am the resistance.
[02:49:41.306 --> 02:49:42.487]  It's an awesome shirt.
[02:49:42.507 --> 02:49:42.487]  $19.95.
[02:49:43.387 --> 02:49:45.148]  High quality fabric.
[02:49:45.188 --> 02:49:45.989]  Made right here in America.
[02:49:46.049 --> 02:49:46.789]  Printed in America.
[02:49:47.530 --> 02:49:49.711]  You know, it's costing us six, seven bucks to do that in America.
[02:49:49.731 --> 02:49:51.032]  We do it for three bucks in Mexico.
[02:49:51.432 --> 02:49:52.033]  So it's there.
[02:49:52.453 --> 02:49:53.453]  Help fund the operation.
[02:49:53.533 --> 02:49:53.934]  Reelect45.

[02:50:41.276 --> 02:50:44.737]  I've been a bad boy, so every caller I don't get to gets a free t-shirt of their choice.
[02:50:45.337 --> 02:50:47.718]  That's a rule, somebody's held more than an hour, I've been a bad person.
[02:50:48.138 --> 02:50:50.259]  I apologize everybody, but let's go to some calls right now.
[02:50:50.739 --> 02:50:53.660]  Preston in the great state of Missouri, then Brad and others.
[02:50:53.700 --> 02:50:54.680]  Thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[02:50:55.882 --> 02:51:03.604]  Alex, thank you for taking my call and thank you as well as the crew for the amazing fight you put up against the New Order and globalism every day.
[02:51:03.624 --> 02:51:05.545]  I want to plug your products real quick.
[02:51:05.605 --> 02:51:07.165]  I bought pretty much all of your products.
[02:51:07.705 --> 02:51:08.746]  Use many of them daily.
[02:51:09.286 --> 02:51:10.486]  Use others incrementally.
[02:51:10.546 --> 02:51:19.549]  I joined a family and friend who are struggling with health and thank you for making it easy to support the tip of the spear in the cultural war.
[02:51:21.016 --> 02:51:21.797]  I want to thank you.
[02:51:21.817 --> 02:51:22.397]  I want to thank you.
[02:51:22.417 --> 02:51:23.578]  We're in this together, brother.
[02:51:23.598 --> 02:51:24.618]  I know you know this.
[02:51:24.638 --> 02:51:27.780]  When you realize how they're truly evil, it's not like thanking each other.
[02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:29.201]  We're fighting for our lives here, brother!
[02:51:29.221 --> 02:51:31.483]  Absolutely right.
[02:51:31.723 --> 02:51:33.184]  I agree.
[02:51:33.304 --> 02:51:35.045]  On to my 9-11 complaint and question.
[02:51:35.585 --> 02:51:40.428]  We know 9-11 was an inside job conducted by criminal elements fell out within our government.
[02:51:41.449 --> 02:51:43.250]  Pretty much all the evidence shows that.
[02:51:43.270 --> 02:51:45.872]  9-11 is what woke me up personally.
[02:51:45.972 --> 02:51:49.234]  You producing loose change among many other things.
[02:51:50.129 --> 02:52:00.614]  In my opinion, 9-11 is the Pandora's box, the skeleton key, to open up the doors to the Global Assault Order for those who are still asleep.
[02:52:01.335 --> 02:52:14.461]  So, my question on Trump's 9-11 stance is, if we're ever going to take back control of the deep state, the people who were, you know, behind 9-11 may need to be brought to their knees, put in prison, or worse.
[02:52:14.921 --> 02:52:16.262]  How do you see it pointing out
[02:52:17.379 --> 02:52:18.761]  I'm very interested in your answer here.
[02:52:18.802 --> 02:52:21.986]  How do you see it going on with Rudy Giuliani being a Trump warrior?
[02:52:34.793 --> 02:52:39.236]  Look, if you bring out full 9-11, which Trump would like to do, it will tank the stock market.
[02:52:39.797 --> 02:52:41.958]  There will be a civil war on our side.
[02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:50.285]  It's kind of like a thing in war is where if the enemy surrenders, you let them basically leave and go live on an island, like with Napoleon.
[02:52:50.845 --> 02:52:51.786]  It's been found to be better.
[02:52:54.483 --> 02:53:00.347]  9-11 did have Islamic involvement, but there were criminal elements working with it to stand down and all the rest of it and bombs the buildings.
[02:53:00.907 --> 02:53:01.928]  And so Trump knows that.
[02:53:01.968 --> 02:53:02.729]  He said that at the time.
[02:53:02.789 --> 02:53:03.489]  That's why he's attacked.
[02:53:03.869 --> 02:53:08.713]  And now he's letting the deep state know, I'll play the ace card, ace of spades, if you try this, OK?
[02:53:09.333 --> 02:53:11.294]  And so I trust the president on this.
[02:53:11.434 --> 02:53:17.238]  I'm the one that got, I'm not going to get into it all, but the president's ready to move and he intends to bring it all out in good time.
[02:53:17.578 --> 02:53:19.120]  That's a very complex issue, though.
[02:53:19.160 --> 02:53:20.921]  I mean, Trump is the president now, Will.
[02:53:21.161 --> 02:53:22.182]  Trump's the president, Joey.
[02:53:22.522 --> 02:53:24.163]  He knows all this damning stuff.
[02:53:24.723 --> 02:53:28.287]  He's kind of giving them rope, and I'm not saying he should cover anything up, but there's so much dirt.
[02:53:28.607 --> 02:53:32.972]  If he made it all about that, we would go into a civil war.
[02:53:33.052 --> 02:53:37.296]  So there's a real wisdom to this, and I'm lined up with Trump's discernment.
[02:53:37.656 --> 02:53:39.318]  And so I'm just taking it one step at a time.
[02:53:39.618 --> 02:53:40.079]  What do you think?
[02:53:43.827 --> 02:53:46.690]  My opinion is that we get the job done.
[02:53:47.011 --> 02:53:47.631]  We get results.
[02:53:47.771 --> 02:53:50.394]  I've seen, you know, you look at what's happening in Saudi Arabia.
[02:53:50.414 --> 02:53:54.578]  I was always uncomfortable how friendly we've been with them, especially the Bushes.
[02:53:55.079 --> 02:53:57.921]  And I was uncomfortable with how friendly Trump is with them.
[02:53:57.941 --> 02:54:01.225]  But if you look at it, they're arresting people massively.
[02:54:01.265 --> 02:54:03.387]  And it looks like things are being cleaned up.
[02:54:03.427 --> 02:54:04.828]  Oh, he's kicking that whole group out.
[02:54:05.069 --> 02:54:05.269]  Yeah.
[02:54:06.410 --> 02:54:07.171]  So I just want results.
[02:54:08.049 --> 02:54:08.749]  Well, exactly.
[02:54:08.970 --> 02:54:13.112]  And look, look, we've already been lied to about bombs in the buildings and all this, whatever happened.
[02:54:13.152 --> 02:54:17.415]  The point is, if Trump can get the people that did it out of power, put some in prison, that's great.
[02:54:17.656 --> 02:54:18.756]  I'm not saying cover it up.
[02:54:18.876 --> 02:54:21.278]  I'm just saying, how do we bring this out?
[02:54:22.339 --> 02:54:25.301]  I was just trying to expose the conspirators so we get a good government to stop it.
[02:54:25.561 --> 02:54:27.742]  But something this bad, how do you bring that out?
[02:54:27.782 --> 02:54:29.884]  That's what I'm asking, Joey and Will.
[02:54:32.205 --> 02:54:34.227]  You know, one of the things is... Go ahead.
[02:54:36.599 --> 02:54:39.723]  I was going to say one of the things is all you have to do is ask about Building 7.
[02:54:39.883 --> 02:54:43.367]  As soon as you ask about Building 7, they all shut down.
[02:54:43.807 --> 02:54:49.593]  And you know one thing I hear Alex, I hear a lot of people always talking about Infowars and conspiracy theories, but you know what?
[02:54:49.633 --> 02:54:51.015]  You've always been correct.
[02:54:51.535 --> 02:54:53.818]  I've yet to see them disprove what you're saying.
[02:54:53.838 --> 02:54:56.301]  I mean, you talk about news today.
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:54:58.401]  That's gonna happen tomorrow.
[02:54:59.002 --> 02:55:05.327]  And then it becomes, you know, reality and they don't understand how was it possible that you're coming up with this information.
[02:55:05.347 --> 02:55:07.268]  Like, you have the inside track to all of it.
[02:55:07.849 --> 02:55:08.729]  And they don't like it.
[02:55:08.769 --> 02:55:11.972]  That's why you get these talk shows attacking you the way they do.
[02:55:12.593 --> 02:55:13.513]  It's unbelievable.
[02:55:14.394 --> 02:55:15.955]  The big secret is I'm not that smart.
[02:55:15.995 --> 02:55:19.018]  The globalists communicate in publications with each other and admit all this.
[02:55:19.618 --> 02:55:21.900]  And then with us, they treat us like we're morons.
[02:55:21.980 --> 02:55:22.621]  It's just crazy.
[02:55:23.141 --> 02:55:24.422]  I'm gonna jam in one more call here.
[02:55:24.442 --> 02:55:25.343]  You were gonna say something, Joey?
[02:55:26.849 --> 02:55:30.752]  I would also say maybe we should trust the strength of the public more than we do.
[02:55:30.772 --> 02:55:33.074]  I think that we can't handle the truth.
[02:55:33.154 --> 02:55:39.819]  And so I've just understood that when you lie to the public all the time, we tend to like, you know, we become too sensitive.
[02:55:40.319 --> 02:55:42.121]  So I say the truth is great for the country.
[02:55:42.904 --> 02:55:47.666]  No, I hear you, and I've not pushed Trump to bring out 9-11 just because I wasn't even thinking about it.
[02:55:47.706 --> 02:55:54.050]  And then, I don't want to brag or anything, but, I mean, let me tell you, I got told.
[02:55:54.150 --> 02:55:55.951]  I mean, it's his next deal.
[02:55:56.491 --> 02:55:58.132]  I got told last night at 10 o'clock at night.
[02:55:58.872 --> 02:56:02.834]  And I was like, okay, all right, yes sir.
[02:56:03.214 --> 02:56:06.816]  It wasn't Trump, obviously, I was talking to.
[02:56:11.679 --> 02:56:13.300]  These guys are a lot of trouble, man.
[02:56:13.801 --> 02:56:15.482]  I can't believe how good Trump is, though.
[02:56:15.502 --> 02:56:19.285]  My gut, my spirit tells me he's good, but I keep getting paranoid, like, is this really happening?
[02:56:19.305 --> 02:56:20.126]  What do you guys think about that?
[02:56:20.226 --> 02:56:25.110]  I mean, at a gut, spiritual level, what do you, when you ask Christ about Trump, what do you get back?
[02:56:25.570 --> 02:56:27.732]  I get back, this is my wrecking ball, get out of the way.
[02:56:29.497 --> 02:56:32.419]  I think Trump is what this country needed this day and time.
[02:56:33.039 --> 02:56:34.000]  It's 100%.
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:35.521]  I'm still thankful.
[02:56:35.541 --> 02:56:40.364]  Thank God that Donald J. Trump is our president and not the Hildebeest, Hillary Clinton.
[02:56:40.964 --> 02:56:42.905]  She would have destroyed everything.
[02:56:42.925 --> 02:56:44.887]  The Democrats are on a path to destroy this nation.
[02:56:44.907 --> 02:56:45.547]  They're Satanists.
[02:56:45.567 --> 02:56:46.808]  They can't do anything but destroy.
[02:56:47.808 --> 02:56:48.068]  Yes.
[02:56:48.889 --> 02:56:49.849]  And that is their plan.
[02:56:49.869 --> 02:56:50.830]  That's what they want to do.
[02:56:51.390 --> 02:56:54.852]  And I think, you know, what we're doing, we're trying to expose all of that.
[02:56:54.892 --> 02:57:00.875]  When I went to the cafe in Oakland, the whole point was to expose the hatefulness, the evilness of the left.
[02:57:01.236 --> 02:57:01.896]  A hundred percent.
[02:57:01.976 --> 02:57:02.897]  God, they're so hateful.
[02:57:03.517 --> 02:57:04.297]  What happened to the left, though?
[02:57:04.317 --> 02:57:05.078]  Because I was younger.
[02:57:05.098 --> 02:57:08.020]  There were a lot of nice hippies, liberals that were smart about stuff that was right.
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:08.960]  They didn't have that spirit.
[02:57:10.341 --> 02:57:12.202]  There were some bad Republicans and bad Democrats.
[02:57:12.222 --> 02:57:13.002]  It was kind of a mix.
[02:57:13.042 --> 02:57:15.784]  But something happened along the way with Democrats.
[02:57:15.844 --> 02:57:17.345]  I think just the media weaponized them.
[02:57:19.088 --> 02:57:22.310]  I think personally, I think Satan realized his time is short.
[02:57:22.770 --> 02:57:25.191]  So he's trying to work on these people to destroy.
[02:57:25.231 --> 02:57:29.693]  You've got to go faster and faster to do as much as you can to destroy this nation.
[02:57:30.173 --> 02:57:32.034]  Time is wasting according to them.
[02:57:32.454 --> 02:57:38.237]  If Satan went to the DNC and was talking to the Democrats, which policy would the Democrats disagree with?
[02:57:38.637 --> 02:57:39.097]  None of them.
[02:57:39.298 --> 02:57:39.538]  That's right.
[02:57:39.558 --> 02:57:41.338]  They would agree with all of them.
[02:57:41.359 --> 02:57:41.879]  We'll be back!
[02:57:42.539 --> 02:57:46.081]  The devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows his time is short.
[02:57:46.941 --> 02:57:49.683]  By due understanding, reckon the number is 666.
[02:57:50.323 --> 02:58:01.890]  Fourth hour, straight ahead with Paul Watson and... Years ago, InfoWars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:58:02.090 --> 02:58:09.735]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:58:09.955 --> 02:58:13.097]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:58:13.297 --> 02:58:18.399]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:58:18.559 --> 02:58:21.100]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.

[02:58:30.484 --> 02:58:42.129]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.

[02:58:58.477 --> 02:59:01.779]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:59:02.640 --> 02:59:08.885]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:59:10.666 --> 02:59:17.007]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:59:17.807 --> 02:59:23.048]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:59:23.669 --> 02:59:35.791]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[02:59:36.471 --> 02:59:41.997]  Makaru from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.

[02:59:54.749 --> 03:00:00.655]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.660 --> 03:00:11.681]  From the front lines.
[03:00:11.941 --> 03:00:16.903]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.724 --> 03:00:19.685]  Will Johnson, Joey Gibson, take a few calls.
[03:00:19.745 --> 03:00:22.707]  Owen Shorter's riding a shotgun with me in the next segment with Paul Watson.
[03:00:22.727 --> 03:00:23.647]  He's got a big announcement to make.
[03:00:24.047 --> 03:00:25.028]  The war room's coming up today.
[03:00:25.048 --> 03:00:26.709]  We've got big news breaking on that.
[03:00:26.749 --> 03:00:27.549]  I can't tell you yet.
[03:00:28.029 --> 03:00:30.091]  Roger Stone's got to get authorization before he breaks it.
[03:00:30.831 --> 03:00:32.292]  But again, we're on fire today.
[03:00:32.312 --> 03:00:34.033]  I appreciate everybody holding, everybody that doesn't get on.
[03:00:34.733 --> 03:00:38.414]  It's a free t-shirt or whatever they want, $20 value.
[03:00:38.434 --> 03:00:38.954]  I apologize.
[03:00:38.994 --> 03:00:39.535]  I respect you.
[03:00:39.575 --> 03:00:39.995]  I love you.
[03:00:40.355 --> 03:00:41.075]  I appreciate you.
[03:00:41.475 --> 03:00:43.436]  But I can take 50 calls at a time, so I can't get to everybody.
[03:00:44.156 --> 03:00:45.076]  Who's up next here?
[03:00:45.136 --> 03:00:46.377]  Is it a Brad in Texas?
[03:00:46.457 --> 03:00:47.717]  Jayvon in New Jersey?
[03:00:48.857 --> 03:00:49.198]  Chase?
[03:00:49.238 --> 03:00:49.698]  There's so many.
[03:00:50.038 --> 03:00:50.878]  Pastor Sam?
[03:00:51.678 --> 03:00:56.560]  Oh, by the way, DrugsReport.com is linked to our Socialist Say Bernie 2 right wing.
[03:00:58.305 --> 03:00:59.266]  It's not communist enough.
[03:01:00.166 --> 03:01:01.467]  I'm a democratic socialist.
[03:01:02.828 --> 03:01:03.489]  We want a communist.
[03:01:03.609 --> 03:01:05.390]  Okay, I've always been that.
[03:01:05.690 --> 03:01:07.091]  I honeymooned in the Soviet Union.
[03:01:08.512 --> 03:01:09.733]  So, who's up first here?
[03:01:10.173 --> 03:01:12.335]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brad in Texas.
[03:01:12.355 --> 03:01:14.076]  You're on the air with our full house here.
[03:01:14.116 --> 03:01:14.416]  Go ahead.
[03:01:16.138 --> 03:01:17.259]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:01:17.419 --> 03:01:19.760]  I'm actually in Pennsylvania, but I wish I was in Texas.
[03:01:20.081 --> 03:01:21.542]  Well, I apologize for reading it wrong.
[03:01:21.582 --> 03:01:21.802]  Go ahead.
[03:01:22.598 --> 03:01:24.299]  It feels like Texas up here anyway.
[03:01:24.539 --> 03:01:24.819]  Good.
[03:01:25.060 --> 03:01:27.301]  Hey, uh, great show today, as usual.
[03:01:27.341 --> 03:01:29.442]  Don't they call parts of Pennsylvania pencil-tucky?
[03:01:29.482 --> 03:01:30.223]  It's pretty right-wing.
[03:01:30.683 --> 03:01:31.763]  Pencil-tucky!
[03:01:33.204 --> 03:01:35.225]  Yeah, it can be right-wingers.
[03:01:35.366 --> 03:01:48.393]  I'm in liberal, I'm in the liberal part, so, you know, I go, some of these stories that come out, like the, uh, the stuff at the border, man, you can just tell that that stuff is so orchestrated by the media and, you know, my family... Well, it turned out it was all fake.
[03:01:48.413 --> 03:01:49.654]  The little girl was never removed.
[03:01:53.075 --> 03:01:54.056]  So what's on your mind today?
[03:01:54.076 --> 03:01:56.158]  Say it again?
[03:01:57.660 --> 03:01:58.341]  I see what happened.
[03:01:58.381 --> 03:02:01.624]  I said go to Brad in Texas at the bottom and then went to Brad in Pennsylvania, but that makes sense.
[03:02:01.905 --> 03:02:03.326]  Brad in Pennsylvania, go ahead and make your point.
[03:02:04.127 --> 03:02:06.470]  No, I just want to say what a great show it is.
[03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:08.051]  How awesome you are, man.
[03:02:08.151 --> 03:02:11.435]  I've been listening to you since around 2003 religiously.
[03:02:11.475 --> 03:02:12.977]  I mean, I don't mean that, you know.
[03:02:14.459 --> 03:02:21.067]  Uh, but the way it sounds, but just, you know, I make sure I listen to you because your news program is, it rocks.
[03:02:21.307 --> 03:02:23.029]  You provide hardcore news.
[03:02:23.049 --> 03:02:26.713]  Well, obviously we're just covering what the Global's really saying, but you the listeners are the power of the show.
[03:02:26.733 --> 03:02:29.516]  I mean, let me tell you, I took my daughter's drop-off at camp for a couple weeks.
[03:02:30.317 --> 03:02:40.443]  And every camp counselor, male and female, everywhere I went dropping them off, because I have two dollars, everyone in different spots, were like, oh, I was listening yesterday, I love Owen Schroyer, oh, I love you guys, keep it up, I know they're attacking you.
[03:02:40.763 --> 03:02:42.525]  And my wife was like, good lord.
[03:02:42.905 --> 03:02:44.506]  It's like everyone here is a listener.
[03:02:44.586 --> 03:02:47.347]  Even little kids had InfoWars on their trunks and stuff.
[03:02:47.568 --> 03:02:50.249]  And I'm saying the most exciting thing is the young people are awake.
[03:02:50.449 --> 03:02:55.212]  And it's not that InfoWars is important, it's that it's a focal point for what we're really saying.
[03:02:55.252 --> 03:02:56.373]  And that's why they hate it.
[03:02:56.413 --> 03:02:57.153]  God bless you, Brad.
[03:02:58.174 --> 03:03:01.095]  We're going to get some final comments from our guest here in a moment, but now let's go.
[03:03:01.396 --> 03:03:02.076]  I wasn't wrong.
[03:03:02.136 --> 03:03:03.056]  I said Brad in Texas.
[03:03:03.076 --> 03:03:04.157]  They went to the other Brad, but that's okay.
[03:03:04.177 --> 03:03:05.598]  That happens because I jump around.
[03:03:05.898 --> 03:03:06.858]  Brad in Texas.
[03:03:06.878 --> 03:03:08.119]  You're now on the air with our guest.
[03:03:08.139 --> 03:03:08.499]  Go ahead.
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:11.401]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[03:03:11.541 --> 03:03:12.281]  Oh, and everyone else.
[03:03:12.701 --> 03:03:13.162]  Welcome, sir.
[03:03:13.202 --> 03:03:13.782]  Good to have you here.
[03:03:13.822 --> 03:03:15.963]  Well, we're on the brink of a hot civil war.
[03:03:16.263 --> 03:03:20.405]  It's been a, it's been a stealth civil war, uh, as, uh, our guests have said.
[03:03:21.726 --> 03:03:23.907]  Well, earlier you said what's bigger than brace for?
[03:03:24.898 --> 03:03:31.605]  But what's bigger than race war is that they need a race war to bring in the United Nations to come and take over all over the United States.
[03:03:31.625 --> 03:03:35.009]  And by the way, I used to hear old-timers say that 25 years ago, and I thought they were nuts.
[03:03:35.109 --> 03:03:37.291]  Those guys had all been in military intelligence now, I know.
[03:03:37.612 --> 03:03:40.135]  That was the plan then, and now it's official!
[03:03:41.977 --> 03:03:46.679]  And not just that, I have documents from September of 1961 from the State Department.
[03:03:46.699 --> 03:03:51.122]  It's called the United States Program for General and Complete Disarmament.
[03:03:51.142 --> 03:03:51.122]  7277.
[03:03:51.362 --> 03:03:51.822]  Yep.
[03:03:52.542 --> 03:03:53.703]  Exactly, that's what it is.
[03:03:54.303 --> 03:03:59.486]  And basically it goes over how we need a stronger international institution to take over the United States and stop wars.
[03:03:59.526 --> 03:04:03.588]  But the only way they're going to have that happen, to bring in the UN, is to start a war.
[03:04:03.908 --> 03:04:04.349]  Exactly.
[03:04:04.409 --> 03:04:06.410]  Nobody's going to frontal assault America.
[03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:08.050]  They're going to do it from within, Owen.
[03:04:10.292 --> 03:04:11.032]  Anything else, Brad?
[03:04:13.430 --> 03:04:16.914]  Well Alex, I just want to agree with you and then need a comment from our guest here.
[03:04:17.215 --> 03:04:19.818]  The InfoWars audience is the most powerful audience in the world.
[03:04:20.218 --> 03:04:21.420]  That's who they fear, not me.
[03:04:21.560 --> 03:04:21.941]  Bar none.
[03:04:22.021 --> 03:04:22.601]  It's not even close.
[03:04:23.442 --> 03:04:23.963]  It's undoubtable.
[03:04:25.104 --> 03:04:25.945]  Because they're awake.
[03:04:27.127 --> 03:04:27.988]  They know what's going on.
[03:04:28.248 --> 03:04:28.729]  It's not us.
[03:04:28.769 --> 03:04:29.490]  We're just a focal point.
[03:04:30.219 --> 03:04:34.961]  And then you have Will Johnson here, who's a perfect example, who goes out and faces these people in the streets.
[03:04:35.601 --> 03:04:36.422]  That's what we need more of.
[03:04:36.462 --> 03:04:38.562]  That's the bravery of this audience.
[03:04:38.643 --> 03:04:42.284]  What other audience goes out and creates uniteamericanfirst.com?
[03:04:42.604 --> 03:04:42.904]  That's right.
[03:04:42.944 --> 03:04:43.765]  Paul Watts has taken over.
[03:04:43.785 --> 03:04:45.765]  I'm going to get a final comment from both of these gentlemen.
[03:04:46.466 --> 03:04:48.727]  And then we've got a special announcement for the President here.
[03:04:49.087 --> 03:04:50.768]  Straight ahead, we're back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:50.868 --> 03:04:52.728]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:04:53.008 --> 03:04:56.390]  There's not a bigger act of rebellion against the globalists you can engage in.
[03:04:56.790 --> 03:05:01.552]  And not a better act of being honorable to God than to spread the length of this show.
[03:05:03.332 --> 03:05:05.273]  This 4th of July is special.
[03:05:05.293 --> 03:05:06.773]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[03:05:07.274 --> 03:05:11.415]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[03:05:11.715 --> 03:05:15.376]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[03:05:16.077 --> 03:05:21.158]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[03:05:21.198 --> 03:05:24.940]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[03:05:25.800 --> 03:05:27.661]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[03:05:28.081 --> 03:05:29.942]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[03:05:30.022 --> 03:05:33.123]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[03:05:33.163 --> 03:05:39.846]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[03:05:40.306 --> 03:05:42.187]  We have record sales going on right now.
[03:05:43.180 --> 03:05:45.221]  Free shipping on hundreds of different items.
[03:05:45.541 --> 03:05:48.521]  More than 20 items are 50% off, like Brain Force Plus.
[03:05:49.282 --> 03:05:50.302]  X2 is 40% off.
[03:05:50.722 --> 03:05:52.562]  Knockout Sleep Aid, $17.76.
[03:05:52.962 --> 03:05:55.483]  Silver Bullets, $9.95, a little silver.
[03:05:56.223 --> 03:05:57.964]  And free shipping, you can't beat that.
[03:05:58.284 --> 03:06:01.305]  This Fourth of July is special, and our sales are special to match it.
[03:06:01.525 --> 03:06:02.605]  Infowarrestore.com.
[03:06:09.235 --> 03:06:14.157]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:14.757 --> 03:06:17.458]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:18.478 --> 03:06:26.441]  Tired kids all slipping, slipping, slipping
[03:06:38.098 --> 03:06:40.019]  All right, Paul Watson's about to get on.
[03:06:40.039 --> 03:06:42.421]  We only got two Skype lines, so we're gonna get one of these great guys off.
[03:06:42.441 --> 03:06:44.121]  We'll get Paul dialed in about to take over.
[03:06:44.502 --> 03:06:46.783]  Finishing up, statements on just the epic moment in time.
[03:06:46.803 --> 03:06:48.964]  We're at Will Johnson of YonAmericaFirst.com.
[03:06:51.105 --> 03:06:53.186]  Yes, thank you for having me once again.
[03:06:53.206 --> 03:06:54.827]  I've really enjoyed it.
[03:06:54.847 --> 03:06:55.768]  It's been a real honor.
[03:06:56.028 --> 03:07:01.671]  I would like to extend an invitation to you, Alex Jones, to come on my broadcast with me if that's possible.
[03:07:01.831 --> 03:07:04.593]  You are either Owen or most definitely even Rob.
[03:07:05.413 --> 03:07:06.694]  I want to come on your show anytime.
[03:07:08.018 --> 03:07:10.960]  That would be absolutely phenomenal if you would join me.
[03:07:11.621 --> 03:07:12.662]  I just want to say, you know what?
[03:07:12.822 --> 03:07:14.703]  M4 Wars is the tip of the spear.
[03:07:15.203 --> 03:07:17.645]  I think what you're doing is so heroic.
[03:07:18.206 --> 03:07:24.691]  It's just something that we all can look up to and admire and that we have to get in this fight together.
[03:07:24.751 --> 03:07:26.552]  Sitting down is no longer an option.
[03:07:26.952 --> 03:07:28.453]  So I want to thank you for having me on.
[03:07:29.914 --> 03:07:30.955]  I want to thank you.
[03:07:30.975 --> 03:07:31.476]  God bless you.
[03:07:31.496 --> 03:07:34.258]  Let me just say something about Will Johnson, United America, First to Come.
[03:07:34.498 --> 03:07:35.399]  See how humble he is?
[03:07:35.479 --> 03:07:38.261]  He's just as well spoken, has just as much courage as I do.
[03:07:38.281 --> 03:07:39.422]  He heard what we were doing.
[03:07:39.442 --> 03:07:40.082]  He was already awake.
[03:07:40.122 --> 03:07:40.963]  He went out and took action.
[03:07:41.223 --> 03:07:42.224]  He's just here thanking us.
[03:07:42.564 --> 03:07:43.125]  Take the left.
[03:07:43.165 --> 03:07:46.967]  It's all about them, about their Satanism, about their personal power, about where they're going.
[03:07:47.328 --> 03:07:48.429]  They think they're ascending.
[03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:49.690]  They're sinking into hell.
[03:07:50.330 --> 03:07:50.731]  August 4th.
[03:08:09.468 --> 03:08:15.010]  Basically, the goal is this, is we respond by their violence with getting more people to show up.
[03:08:15.070 --> 03:08:19.351]  If we can flood the streets with thousands of people, you know, we know the support is out there.
[03:08:19.491 --> 03:08:23.833]  It's about inspiring them to actually go out there and stand up for what they believe in.
[03:08:24.233 --> 03:08:29.454]  Because the enemy, the elites, all these people at the top, they don't want us to stand up for what we believe in.
[03:08:29.474 --> 03:08:30.715]  They want us to remain silent.
[03:08:31.095 --> 03:08:34.976]  And Alex, if you can be there, you're the one guy that can, you know, bring thousands of people with you.
[03:08:35.376 --> 03:08:36.377]  And we'd love to have you.
[03:08:36.577 --> 03:08:37.517]  And I think it will
[03:08:37.557 --> 03:08:43.180]  Make the event a lot more safe because we can't trust the police if we just flooded the streets.
[03:08:43.280 --> 03:08:44.601]  I want to go to all these events.
[03:08:45.081 --> 03:08:46.282]  Here's the thing.
[03:08:46.842 --> 03:08:53.206]  I'm here running these operations and I'm every day getting important communiqués what we need to do and I want to do it.
[03:08:53.626 --> 03:08:56.308]  Then they've got me pinned down because when I leave they go after my family.
[03:08:56.608 --> 03:08:58.529]  I've got to take my family with me now everywhere.
[03:08:58.569 --> 03:08:59.490]  It's gotten really bad.
[03:09:00.091 --> 03:09:00.992]  I can't get into all that.
[03:09:01.012 --> 03:09:02.534]  I had to go off air yesterday because of it.
[03:09:03.256 --> 03:09:04.498]  We need everybody's prayers here.
[03:09:04.518 --> 03:09:05.319]  I'm not complaining about it.
[03:09:05.359 --> 03:09:08.664]  I asked for all this, but I do need the prayers, so absolutely.
[03:09:09.666 --> 03:09:10.447]  Joey, thank you so much.
[03:09:10.467 --> 03:09:11.169]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:09:11.289 --> 03:09:11.689]  Great job.
[03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:19.453]  Well, and thanks to the support we get from our audience, you know, we have so many reporters now that we can actually send crews out to these events, get the footage.
[03:09:19.893 --> 03:09:25.475]  And that's the key, is to get the footage and just put a camera up to these people and just say, hey, what are you doing out here?
[03:09:25.695 --> 03:09:28.837]  Oh, you know, I'm protesting at a children being separated from children.
[03:09:29.217 --> 03:09:29.537]  Oh, really?
[03:09:29.597 --> 03:09:31.478]  I guess you didn't care about it eight years ago then.
[03:09:32.438 --> 03:09:36.421]  Or, whistleblowers have come out that Obama would put them with child traffickers and have them unvetted.
[03:09:36.601 --> 03:09:39.203]  Here, just let kids cross the border and get in vans randomly.
[03:09:39.383 --> 03:09:40.083]  That's a great idea.
[03:09:40.303 --> 03:09:42.365]  Coyotes can just pick them right up on the Texas side.
[03:09:42.805 --> 03:09:43.806]  Oh, what a wonderful idea.
[03:09:43.826 --> 03:09:45.226]  Violate federal law, you know.
[03:09:45.246 --> 03:09:48.729]  Their parents send them here with, you know, playing... Darker than night in a desert with rattlesnakes.
[03:09:48.749 --> 03:09:51.490]  Little kids come across with people who don't even know who the hell they are.
[03:09:51.670 --> 03:09:53.411]  Don't check anybody, just here, come on in!
[03:09:54.672 --> 03:09:55.153]  Sounds great.
[03:09:55.213 --> 03:09:55.673]  Open borders.
[03:09:55.733 --> 03:09:56.954]  Oh, but we don't want open borders.
[03:09:57.334 --> 03:09:58.135]  That's not what we want.
[03:09:58.495 --> 03:10:02.257]  Well, Alex... But everyone has a right to just come on in, according... But that's why you expose them.
[03:10:02.497 --> 03:10:06.460]  That's why you put them on camera, you show who they are, and then you have hashtag walkaway trend on here.
[03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:07.861]  Hey, look who that is right there.
[03:10:07.881 --> 03:10:12.064]  That's Paul Joseph Watson, the great, over there in the UK.
[03:10:12.144 --> 03:10:14.746]  Big article about Trump getting ready to come out about 9-11.
[03:10:15.046 --> 03:10:15.726]  That's all coming up.
[03:10:15.746 --> 03:10:16.987]  He's taking over in T-minus two minutes.
[03:10:17.007 --> 03:10:19.849]  But first, your announcement to the president that we've got here.
[03:10:20.089 --> 03:10:28.137]  Well, you know, I wanted to do something special for President Trump for the 4th of July, and I noticed that he got snubbed by the Philadelphia Eagles.
[03:10:28.177 --> 03:10:28.897]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:10:28.937 --> 03:10:33.982]  He got snubbed by the Super Bowl champion Eagles, and he did not get his championship jersey.
[03:10:34.022 --> 03:10:37.386]  So I went ahead and I ordered one for you, President Trump.
[03:10:37.446 --> 03:10:40.168]  This is your 4th of July present right here.
[03:10:41.129 --> 03:10:42.110]  I can get that delivered right to him.
[03:10:42.250 --> 03:10:43.771]  It's the Eagles-Trump jersey.
[03:10:43.851 --> 03:10:46.652]  I don't know why they didn't want to give it to you, but I had it made, President Trump.
[03:10:46.672 --> 03:10:48.794]  We've got it for you right here in the InfoWars studio.
[03:10:49.074 --> 03:10:49.674]  This is for you.
[03:10:49.714 --> 03:10:51.015]  By the way, I've got a special address.
[03:10:51.075 --> 03:10:51.916]  I could mail him anything.
[03:10:52.256 --> 03:10:53.236]  Oh, little secret out.
[03:10:53.517 --> 03:10:58.560]  We'll mail that sucker right to him today.
[03:10:58.620 --> 03:10:59.760]  This is for President Trump.
[03:11:00.301 --> 03:11:01.161]  Go America.
[03:11:01.281 --> 03:11:01.842]  Go Trump.
[03:11:01.982 --> 03:11:02.882]  Fly, Eagles, fly.
[03:11:02.922 --> 03:11:03.863]  We came into the segment.
[03:11:03.903 --> 03:11:06.705]  It wasn't even supposed to be that way with Fly Like an Eagle, so here we are.
[03:11:07.325 --> 03:11:08.806]  By the way, that wasn't even a setup.
[03:11:08.906 --> 03:11:09.486]  That just happened.
[03:11:09.726 --> 03:11:11.486]  President Trump is flying like an eagle.
[03:11:12.127 --> 03:11:13.947]  He got snubbed by the Super Bowl champions.
[03:11:14.347 --> 03:11:15.027]  I'm not buying it.
[03:11:15.068 --> 03:11:22.130]  So I wanted President Trump to have his jersey here, recognized as President 45, the greatest president in modern history.
[03:11:22.650 --> 03:11:26.131]  And here is your Super Bowl champion eagle's jersey, President Trump.
[03:11:26.151 --> 03:11:27.271]  I hope this receives you well.
[03:11:27.852 --> 03:11:29.572]  And you deserve it.
[03:11:29.732 --> 03:11:35.254]  Notice that Lynch and all these top real liberals are saying Trump may be the greatest president ever.
[03:11:35.970 --> 03:11:37.093]  I mean, let me tell you.
[03:11:37.153 --> 03:11:39.680]  Well, when history pans out, we can talk about that.
[03:11:39.700 --> 03:11:42.066]  But modern history, my life, not even close.
[03:11:42.086 --> 03:11:42.748]  There's no debate.
[03:11:42.828 --> 03:11:43.971]  Yeah, he's already eclipsed Reagan.
[03:11:45.589 --> 03:11:47.511]  Because Reagan got shot in the first year to get him.
[03:11:47.891 --> 03:11:49.872]  All right, Paul Watson, you're taking over my friend.
[03:11:49.933 --> 03:11:50.493]  Great job.
[03:11:50.893 --> 03:11:51.294]  We love you.
[03:11:51.314 --> 03:11:51.814]  We appreciate you.
[03:11:51.834 --> 03:11:56.438]  By the way, we have the new T-shirt we're selling because they have Impeach Trump 45 at Walmart.
[03:11:56.458 --> 03:11:59.500]  We have Reelect Trump at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:00.581]  Reelect 45.
[03:12:01.422 --> 03:12:04.204]  So it's Reelect, not the other one.
[03:12:04.224 --> 03:12:05.405]  That's now exclusively available.
[03:12:05.545 --> 03:12:07.106]  They're getting printed right here, right here in Texas.
[03:12:07.407 --> 03:12:08.247]  Shipped out next week.
[03:12:08.267 --> 03:12:08.988]  Get your order in now.
[03:12:09.368 --> 03:12:10.509]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:12:10.549 --> 03:12:11.150]  No reviews yet.
[03:12:11.170 --> 03:12:11.830]  We just launched today.
[03:12:11.850 --> 03:12:14.532]  And then we have, we have Meme Like a Wolverine.
[03:12:15.533 --> 03:12:18.515]  It's not the Marvel comic Wimpy Wolverine, it's the Trump Wolverine.
[03:12:18.555 --> 03:12:19.215]  Can we pull that up?
[03:12:19.555 --> 03:12:21.516]  That's available at Infowarstore.com.
[03:12:22.236 --> 03:12:24.497]  So be sure and get those and fund the operation.
[03:12:24.838 --> 03:12:26.358]  Everybody have a great July 4th.
[03:12:26.799 --> 03:12:32.701]  And now the master of ceremonies for the 2018 July 4th is the Red Coat Supreme Leader, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:12:32.721 --> 03:12:33.582]  My friend, please take over.
[03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:36.171]  Thanks Alex, happy 4th of July.
[03:12:36.191 --> 03:12:45.635]  Yeah, I'm looking at these polls which have come out since the whole scandal over the border issue, which of course was the lightest scandal that was supposed to sink President Trump for good.
[03:12:45.655 --> 03:12:47.936]  We have one every week from the mainstream media.
[03:12:48.437 --> 03:12:53.039]  But what's happened, this is really interesting, over the course of the past two weeks, just under
[03:12:53.639 --> 03:13:05.329]  ...is that President Trump's approval rating, despite being relentlessly pounded by the mainstream media over this border enforcement issue, his approval rating, and this is real clear politics, headline...
[03:13:06.187 --> 03:13:06.848]  Media fail.
[03:13:06.948 --> 03:13:10.830]  Trump's approval rating improved during manufactured border outrage.
[03:13:11.170 --> 03:13:12.711]  This is real clear politics.
[03:13:13.252 --> 03:13:17.655]  Average of polls, poll of polls, it's gone up by five points.
[03:13:18.115 --> 03:13:19.316]  That's not even Rasmussen.
[03:13:19.336 --> 03:13:21.017]  You can't claim it's got Republican bias.
[03:13:21.037 --> 03:13:23.058]  This is the average of all the polls.
[03:13:23.519 --> 03:13:32.585]  His approval rating has gone up five points since this whole separating children from their parents scandal that was supposed to sink him.
[03:13:33.165 --> 03:13:34.526]  Five point improvement.
[03:13:34.546 --> 03:13:35.847]  You drill down into this poll.
[03:13:36.804 --> 03:13:42.930]  A ten point surge in support from, wait for it, Hispanic Americans!
[03:13:43.330 --> 03:13:48.194]  Ten point surge since Trump was supposedly finished with this big border scandal.
[03:13:48.595 --> 03:13:53.559]  His average has gone up five points during the establishment media's manufactured outrage.
[03:13:53.939 --> 03:13:56.762]  So the manufactured media's propaganda is boomeranging.
[03:13:57.523 --> 03:13:58.844]  It's backfiring is what you're saying, Paul?
[03:14:00.117 --> 03:14:02.078]  Yes, they've got no platform, Alex.
[03:14:02.158 --> 03:14:03.438]  It's just constant hysteria.
[03:14:03.758 --> 03:14:07.379]  Remember that scream helplessly at the sky thing from last year?
[03:14:14.962 --> 03:14:19.763]  They're still on that, but then they're adding, oh by the way, start attacking Trump supporters, start attacking Trump.
[03:14:20.164 --> 03:14:21.304]  And then you look at another poll.
[03:14:22.023 --> 03:14:28.026]  Survey finds among white millennial men, 23% move from Democrats to GOP in the last two years.
[03:14:28.486 --> 03:14:33.708]  So they already lost 9% in millennial votes since 2016, which we covered before.
[03:14:34.364 --> 03:14:51.123]  Now another new poll has found that white millennial men, gee I wonder why white millennial men are shifting over to the GOP when every single day the narrative is relentlessly white men are to blame for everything, you know, toxic masculinity, kill all white men trending on Twitter.
[03:14:51.523 --> 03:14:55.528]  So a 23% shift from Dems to GOP in the last two years
[03:14:56.673 --> 03:15:02.517]  Article reads, the Democrats have been relishing their popularity with Millennials for a variety of reasons.
[03:15:02.537 --> 03:15:04.178]  55% of Millennials voted for Hillary Clinton.
[03:15:04.198 --> 03:15:04.919]  33% voted for Trump.
[03:15:08.402 --> 03:15:17.205]  The new polls found that 23% have shifted, even though you've obviously still got overwhelming support for the Democrats, among white millennial men.
[03:15:17.766 --> 03:15:19.426]  It's shifted big time.
[03:15:19.846 --> 03:15:26.589]  A Pew Research study also found that millennials gave a 64% job approval rating to President Obama, but only 27% approval for Trump in 2018.
[03:15:29.491 --> 03:15:32.713]  But this goes alongside the ice poll, obviously.
[03:15:33.073 --> 03:15:39.197]  Part of the freak out, part of the screaming helplessly at the sky is this call to abolish ice.
[03:15:39.597 --> 03:15:44.340]  It is also completely unpopular with the American people.
[03:15:44.360 --> 03:15:47.382]  73% of swing voters oppose the abolition of ice.
[03:15:47.802 --> 03:15:49.263]  This is a losing platform.
[03:15:49.583 --> 03:15:51.944]  It's just hysteria on steroids at this point.
[03:15:52.304 --> 03:15:53.284]  And it's gonna backfire.
[03:15:53.524 --> 03:15:54.165]  It's gonna fail.
[03:15:54.185 --> 03:15:55.465]  So we should be applauding them.
[03:15:55.685 --> 03:15:58.927]  We should be saying they should carry on with this hysterical rhetoric.
[03:15:58.947 --> 03:16:00.247]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:16:00.527 --> 03:16:01.568]  We'll be back in four walls.
[03:16:05.049 --> 03:16:05.749]  July 4th, 2018 is now here.
[03:16:11.769 --> 03:16:19.878]  240 plus years after we declared our intent to sever our ties with the corrupt King of England.
[03:16:20.699 --> 03:16:29.749]  And I was driving into the Infowars News Center just last week, and it hit me like a thunderbolt, like lightning, that this is the crossroads.
[03:16:31.067 --> 03:16:33.369]  The revolution against the globalists is happening.
[03:16:33.709 --> 03:16:35.670]  Their counter-revolution is taking place.
[03:16:36.290 --> 03:16:42.835]  Antifa and George Soros and the globalists are launching riots and violence and race war and economic war all over the planet.
[03:16:42.855 --> 03:16:44.396]  And it hit me.
[03:16:44.836 --> 03:16:48.078]  This, July 4th, 2018, is the binary twin of 1776, metaphysically.
[03:16:48.178 --> 03:16:49.960]  This is it.
[03:16:49.980 --> 03:16:51.841]  It is the jump point.
[03:16:51.881 --> 03:16:52.421]  It is the
[03:17:01.488 --> 03:17:07.770]  Point of no return for the tyrants to defeat us or for humanity to struggle free and control its own destiny.
[03:17:08.471 --> 03:17:27.458]  Ladies and gentlemen, everyone from Michael Moore to Bill Maher to Barack Obama, the communist organizer, are behind the scenes right now and out in the open trying to foment
[03:17:28.695 --> 03:17:33.918]  America destroying itself and Europe destroying itself and Latin America destroying itself.
[03:17:33.938 --> 03:17:35.419]  They're trying to pull us apart.
[03:17:35.679 --> 03:17:37.200]  They're trying to block prosperity.
[03:17:38.261 --> 03:17:47.527]  And they're getting more and more and more and more and more desperate as Trump and other nationalist populist leaders on the left and right.
[03:17:48.336 --> 03:17:55.580]  From Italy to the US, restore prosperity by simply blocking globalism that is designed to make us poor.
[03:17:56.421 --> 03:17:58.342]  They're trying to create giant monopolies.
[03:17:58.382 --> 03:18:04.565]  They're trying to kill any true free market systems because then they'll have complete and total social control.
[03:18:04.606 --> 03:18:06.266]  So this July 4th, 2018 is so special.
[03:18:09.028 --> 03:18:20.173]  It is the new Declaration of Independence against the globalists, the Declaration of Independence against big tech, the Declaration of Independence against Hollywood, and all these control freaks that lust after controlling our minds.
[03:18:21.134 --> 03:18:34.500]  Despite all the censorship, all the attacks, all the Soros and Hillary funded lawsuits, we are steaming forward, having huge victory, and working with powerful patriots across the world to change human destiny.
[03:18:35.407 --> 03:18:45.318]  That's why this July 4th and for a few days after, for the next week or so, we're offering some of the biggest sales ever on more than 20 items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:45.818 --> 03:18:47.660]  We're not funded by megacorporations.
[03:18:47.700 --> 03:18:50.543]  We don't get taxpayer bailouts like MSNBC.
[03:18:50.843 --> 03:18:51.764]  We're funded by you.
[03:18:51.804 --> 03:18:56.650]  We make it easy to support InfoWars because the products are great and they're very, very affordable.

[03:19:44.741 --> 03:19:48.565]  Again, for myself, the entire InfoWars crew and family, you are the InfoWar.
[03:19:48.905 --> 03:19:49.686]  You are the victory.
[03:19:49.726 --> 03:19:50.427]  You're the solution.
[03:19:50.627 --> 03:19:51.528]  You're the reason we're here.
[03:19:51.788 --> 03:19:54.531]  So I commend and thank you all for supporting InfoWars.
[03:19:54.872 --> 03:19:55.692]  Now, God bless you.
[03:19:55.993 --> 03:19:58.756]  And remember, this Fourth of July is more important than ever.
[03:20:06.005 --> 03:20:10.589]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.873 --> 03:20:22.618]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.879 --> 03:20:26.582]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:29.426 --> 03:20:31.607]  We're live and it's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.627 --> 03:20:35.029]  We're talking about the reaction, the fallout, to this scandal.
[03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:44.933]  This latest scandal, there's a new one every week, that was supposed to sink the Trump administration, the border patrol policy, the separation of children from their parents.
[03:20:44.953 --> 03:20:48.374]  We have a new poll out, which is a poll of polls, an average poll.
[03:20:48.855 --> 03:20:54.297]  Headline, media fail, Trump's approval rating improved during manufactured border outrage.
[03:20:54.337 --> 03:20:56.418]  This is by John Nolte over at Breitbart.
[03:20:57.156 --> 03:21:10.403]  President Trump's job approval rating improved by five points during the establishment media's manufactured outrage over Trump continuing the Obama administration's policy of separating illegal alien adults from children at the border.
[03:21:10.944 --> 03:21:12.404]  Now, this is real clear politics.
[03:21:12.424 --> 03:21:19.448]  This is not Rasmussen, which they say, oh, that's Republican bias, even though literally almost every other poll oversamples Democrats.
[03:21:19.888 --> 03:21:22.230]  But this is real clear politics, poll of polls.
[03:21:22.670 --> 03:21:24.371]  Trump's approval rating rounded out
[03:21:25.271 --> 03:21:31.937]  On June 8th, Trump's approval rating rounded out to an average of 42%, while his disapproval rating averaged 54%.
[03:21:32.278 --> 03:21:36.882]  So back on June 8th, it was a 12-point gap.
[03:21:37.382 --> 03:21:49.734]  As of Monday, July 2nd, yesterday, after two weeks of being pounded by the entire media over border enforcement, Trump's approval rating has climbed to 44% and his disapproval rating has dropped.
[03:21:50.635 --> 03:21:59.261]  The margin between the two has improved by five points since this scandal.
[03:21:59.682 --> 03:22:07.848]  Since the scandal they called Trump's Katrina that would sink his presidency again for the 250th time over the past 18 months.
[03:22:08.549 --> 03:22:17.536]  It goes on to point out that when you drill down into this poll, part of that improvement is due to a 10 point surge in support from Hispanic Americans.
[03:22:18.502 --> 03:22:24.349]  John Nolte goes on to comment, because obviously if there's an audio tape of a child crying, that must mean we need to erase the border, right?
[03:22:24.369 --> 03:22:25.109]  And get rid of all laws.
[03:22:38.964 --> 03:22:47.031]  Imagine that you poured all your hopes, your dreams and resources into manufacturing that one bulletproof story that would finally bring this guy down.
[03:22:47.371 --> 03:22:48.472]  And what happened in the end?
[03:22:48.872 --> 03:22:56.398]  Not only is Trump in better shape now than before this fake news jihad, the public is increasingly siding with him on border and immigration issues.
[03:22:57.018 --> 03:23:00.921]  So yeah, they thought that this would be the one issue to sink Trump.
[03:23:01.042 --> 03:23:04.024]  It was a battle of the bulge, all-out assault by the media.
[03:23:05.195 --> 03:23:05.916]  What happened?
[03:23:06.356 --> 03:23:08.158]  Trump came out on top once again.
[03:23:08.678 --> 03:23:12.902]  This is why they seem to be just getting more hysterical, more out of control.
[03:23:13.242 --> 03:23:19.787]  And even though it doesn't work, and anyone from an objective, neutral, a zoomed out perspective can see it's not working.
[03:23:20.067 --> 03:23:24.171]  It's only making swing voters more nervous about voting against Trump.
[03:23:24.571 --> 03:23:26.732]  Because they say, oh my god, this is the other option.
[03:23:27.032 --> 03:23:28.373]  Complete hysteria.
[03:23:28.793 --> 03:23:31.374]  Complete mad cat behaviour every single day.
[03:23:31.714 --> 03:23:32.975]  It's actually helping him.
[03:23:33.275 --> 03:23:36.056]  And it's helping him in terms of white millennial men as well.
[03:23:37.397 --> 03:23:45.861]  As this headline out of Daily Wire discusses, survey finds among white millennial men 23% move from Dems to GOP in last two years.
[03:23:46.920 --> 03:23:52.943]  So we had the millennial percentage shift, which we talked about a couple of months ago, which was 9%.
[03:23:54.364 --> 03:23:58.946]  Democrats have lost 9% millennial support since the 2016 election.
[03:23:59.567 --> 03:24:13.374]  Now the Guardian reports that a Reuters, Ipsos megapoll of 16,000 respondents found that in the last two years, support for Democrats among millennials plunged from 55 to 46%, while support for Republicans has only dropped from 28% to 27%.
[03:24:16.078 --> 03:24:31.291]  So in the last two years on top of that, support from white millennial men, which of course Democrats have completely abandoned and basically blamed them for every mass shooting that's happened over the past year, has gone from the Democrats leading Republicans by 12%
[03:24:34.189 --> 03:24:34.890]  We're good to go.
[03:24:51.676 --> 03:24:58.981]  Are they not reading about the fact that, well, they had a 13, 14 point lead in the race for the House back in December?
[03:24:59.321 --> 03:25:01.062]  That's completely evaporated.
[03:25:01.122 --> 03:25:08.247]  So either within the margin of error or some polls show that Republicans are now ahead in the race for Congress in the midterms.
[03:25:08.927 --> 03:25:10.688]  I mean, are they not reading these polls?
[03:25:10.728 --> 03:25:22.536]  Do they just think that this endless wall of hysteria, this talk of civil war, this talk of confronting, getting in the face of Trump supporters and Trump administration officials, do they think that's actually working?
[03:25:22.556 --> 03:25:23.336]  Because it isn't!
[03:25:23.676 --> 03:25:25.357]  I'm telling you right now, it isn't working.
[03:25:25.678 --> 03:25:27.319]  None of the polls show it's working.
[03:25:27.639 --> 03:25:32.182]  So again, I've talked about this before, like with the David Hogg issue, for example.
[03:25:32.742 --> 03:25:35.744]  People were freaking out back a couple of months ago, three months ago,
[03:25:36.394 --> 03:25:38.897]  About trying to counter David Hogg's narrative.
[03:25:38.937 --> 03:25:40.579]  You don't need to counter his narrative.
[03:25:40.619 --> 03:25:44.264]  He's the biggest gun salesman of the year, bar none.
[03:25:44.925 --> 03:25:45.245]  Okay?
[03:25:45.586 --> 03:25:48.850]  They're shooting themselves in the foot at every available opportunity.
[03:25:48.890 --> 03:25:50.051]  They're scoring on goals.
[03:25:50.091 --> 03:25:52.855]  Don't interrupt the enemy when they're making a mistake.
[03:25:53.385 --> 03:25:55.627]  And it goes straight to the ice issue as well.
[03:25:56.087 --> 03:25:58.108]  We've had, you know, Bernie Sanders.
[03:25:58.629 --> 03:26:00.450]  Bernie Sanders is now on the rack.
[03:26:00.770 --> 03:26:07.174]  Bernie Sanders is too right-wing because he refuses to say that he wants to outright abolish ice.
[03:26:07.895 --> 03:26:16.180]  Even as you have these hard-left protesters occupying ice offices, in some cases throwing bricks, throwing stones at them.
[03:26:16.200 --> 03:26:18.842]  This is a headline out of Daily Caller.
[03:26:19.773 --> 03:26:20.593]  Abolish ICE.
[03:26:20.673 --> 03:26:23.214]  Vandals throw brick through window of GOP office.
[03:26:23.614 --> 03:26:24.915]  Leave graffiti message.
[03:26:25.515 --> 03:26:26.455]  This happened yesterday.
[03:26:26.515 --> 03:26:31.857]  Vandals threw a brick through the window of the Nebraska Republican Party's headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska on Monday night.
[03:26:32.377 --> 03:26:35.058]  Again, this was abolish ICE protesters.
[03:26:35.418 --> 03:26:39.859]  We've had other events, including one in Philadelphia, which is ongoing right now.
[03:26:40.179 --> 03:26:41.299]  Last time I checked, at least.
[03:26:41.820 --> 03:26:46.441]  Protests turned violent as demonstrators arrested in front of Philadelphia ICE building
[03:26:47.037 --> 03:26:55.520]  Protests turned violent as activists were taken into custody on the streets of Philadelphia today as they were calling for the abolishment of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
[03:26:55.880 --> 03:27:06.243]  The protests are taking place in front of the ICE office in Centre City, so they're out, they're getting rowdy, but again, you go back to the polls, which none of them seem to be looking at.
[03:27:06.883 --> 03:27:08.344]  This is a Harvest Harris poll.
[03:27:09.444 --> 03:27:15.346]  Swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats' plan to end all immigration enforcement across the US.
[03:27:16.610 --> 03:27:23.254]  Nearly 3 in 4 swing voters, which is 73%, said they do not want ICE to be disbanded.
[03:27:23.614 --> 03:27:28.156]  Less than 30% of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.
[03:27:28.176 --> 03:27:33.839]  It goes on to say, even Democrat voters are opposed to the abolition of ICE.
[03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:38.482]  Nearly 60% of Democrats said they do not want ICE to be disbanded.
[03:27:39.903 --> 03:27:40.283]  So again,
[03:27:41.318 --> 03:27:52.281]  Every single poll you look at, these policies, this hysteria, is not supported by the majority of the American people or by even really a minority of swing voters.
[03:27:52.342 --> 03:27:54.862]  This is going to backfire on them horribly.
[03:27:55.402 --> 03:28:03.665]  They've lost the gap in terms of the massive lead they had for the House, for the Congress race, and they've lost it in terms of white millennial men.
[03:28:03.685 --> 03:28:04.485]  And why do you think?
[03:28:04.545 --> 03:28:06.506]  It's because every single day the narrative is
[03:28:06.806 --> 03:28:09.148]  To blame white men for everything.
[03:28:09.208 --> 03:28:13.893]  In fact, there was a tweet about this where the individual put up this poll.
[03:28:13.913 --> 03:28:17.276]  23% of white millennial men move from Democrats to Republicans.
[03:28:17.777 --> 03:28:25.665]  Then he had a compilation of every single headline attacking white men as being responsible for literally every evil on the planet.
[03:28:26.306 --> 03:28:27.167]  Right next to it.
[03:28:27.527 --> 03:28:47.323]  The screenshot was literally like five images of condensed text that you would have to blow up to a full screen just to see every single instance of where the mainstream media, of where the hard left, had blamed white men for literally every evil or every imagined evil in their hysterical worldview on the planet.
[03:28:47.663 --> 03:28:49.384]  So that's why they've lost that support.
[03:28:49.684 --> 03:28:57.309]  That's why they continue to lose support amongst everyone, even Hispanics, to the tune of 10% in terms of Trump over the past couple of weeks.
[03:28:57.669 --> 03:28:58.089]  We'll be back.
[03:28:58.129 --> 03:29:00.411]  This is the Alex Jones Show live from 4Wars.com.
[03:29:02.236 --> 03:29:05.681]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:29:06.181 --> 03:29:08.965]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:29:09.485 --> 03:29:15.273]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:29:15.754 --> 03:29:18.537]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:29:19.258 --> 03:29:22.700]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:29:23.080 --> 03:29:29.142]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:29:29.543 --> 03:29:34.605]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:29:35.265 --> 03:29:38.687]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter.
[03:29:39.187 --> 03:29:43.489]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH...
[03:29:52.073 --> 03:29:56.723]  What we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:29:57.304 --> 03:30:01.273]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:30:04.815 --> 03:30:08.899]  What you're about to see are two presidents of the teachers union.
[03:30:09.019 --> 03:30:11.742]  One guy named Dave Perry near Trenton, New Jersey.
[03:30:11.762 --> 03:30:15.085]  Another named Kathleen Valencia in Union City, New Jersey.
[03:30:15.105 --> 03:30:19.249]  And they're talking about covering up child abusers in the public schools.
[03:30:19.930 --> 03:30:22.532]  Dave Perry, the statements he makes are so shocking.
[03:30:22.592 --> 03:30:26.216]  He actually says, we want to turn it back around onto the child.
[03:30:26.236 --> 03:30:27.257]  He says, it's my job.
[03:30:27.857 --> 03:30:32.260]  He says, I'm going to backdate it, that's commit fraud after the incident of abuse.
[03:30:32.720 --> 03:30:34.721]  He says that's his job at the teachers union.
[03:30:34.741 --> 03:30:36.782]  He's there to protect the worst people.
[03:30:37.282 --> 03:30:38.383]  He's there to bend the truth.
[03:30:38.923 --> 03:30:40.624]  And he's there to reverse it back onto the kid.
[03:30:40.644 --> 03:30:44.626]  There's me confronting Dave Perry, who denied the things he said.
[03:30:44.686 --> 03:30:45.767]  Now last night, Alex,
[03:30:46.648 --> 03:30:53.293]  The National Education Association and the NJEA, that's the New Jersey version of it, has suspended him.
[03:30:53.394 --> 03:31:01.921]  So they've suspended one union president and then just today, Alex, we released another woman in New Jersey saying that she was protecting child abuse.
[03:31:02.141 --> 03:31:03.543]  I don't want him coming here with a bunch of lies.
[03:31:03.603 --> 03:31:05.945]  I need to know the truth so that we can bend the truth.
[03:31:06.665 --> 03:31:07.166]  Okay.
[03:31:07.306 --> 03:31:08.547]  I'm not here to hurt anybody.
[03:31:08.907 --> 03:31:09.948]  I'm here to defend.
[03:31:10.509 --> 03:31:13.711]  No matter the worst teachers in the world, I have defended.
[03:31:13.731 --> 03:31:17.134]  Well yeah, I mean it was like a physical... It was bad?
[03:31:17.535 --> 03:31:20.037]  Yeah, like a physical skirmish.
[03:31:20.277 --> 03:31:21.358]  If he comes to me tomorrow...
[03:31:22.754 --> 03:31:25.556]  I'm gonna date it back to the day after the incident.
[03:31:26.156 --> 03:31:26.576]  Okay.
[03:31:26.616 --> 03:31:27.577]  He was upset.
[03:31:27.597 --> 03:31:28.297]  He was worried.
[03:31:28.638 --> 03:31:29.718]  He did shake the kid.
[03:31:29.958 --> 03:31:32.140]  So if they said there was bruises he had, there was bruises where?
[03:31:32.200 --> 03:31:33.961]  I gotta ask him where he hit him.
[03:31:34.901 --> 03:31:37.683]  Yeah, because he was trying to put him back in his seat because he was getting physical.
[03:31:38.043 --> 03:31:38.504]  It was tough.
[03:31:38.804 --> 03:31:40.385]  We reverse it onto the kid.
[03:31:41.085 --> 03:31:42.265]  Okay, yeah.
[03:31:42.446 --> 03:31:43.046]  That's my job.
[03:31:43.226 --> 03:31:45.967]  It's not a good job, but it's my job and what I have to do.
[03:31:46.047 --> 03:31:49.668]  This file right here is from a teacher who had sex with a student.
[03:31:49.688 --> 03:31:49.908]  Okay?
[03:31:49.988 --> 03:31:53.769]  You're not going to jail.
[03:31:53.829 --> 03:31:57.611]  You know what this whole file is about?
[03:31:58.251 --> 03:32:01.072]  It's about whether or not they get to keep their pension.
[03:32:01.652 --> 03:32:02.092]  Okay.
[03:32:03.033 --> 03:32:06.334]  The sex with the teenage girl.
[03:32:07.034 --> 03:32:08.775]  Okay.
[03:32:09.075 --> 03:32:09.635]  Is he going to jail?
[03:32:12.522 --> 03:32:15.025]  I'm being as brutally honest with you as I can.
[03:32:15.846 --> 03:32:24.376]  If you are afraid of a middle school child who called you a d*** and spit on you and advanced towards you, you are in the wrong profession.
[03:32:24.396 --> 03:32:25.016]  Kid's fine.
[03:32:25.937 --> 03:32:26.478]  Kid's not hurt.
[03:32:26.778 --> 03:32:27.820]  Kid got a scratch.
[03:32:28.400 --> 03:32:29.802]  He's gonna give the kid a 65, right?
[03:32:32.239 --> 03:32:34.100]  He's not gonna fail the kid?
[03:32:34.140 --> 03:32:34.580]  No, no.
[03:32:34.620 --> 03:32:36.140]  No, he's not gonna fail the kid?
[03:32:36.780 --> 03:32:41.942]  He's gonna get that kid out of his f***ing classroom and move on fresh for September.
[03:32:42.522 --> 03:32:44.702]  We're facing a crisis in American education.
[03:32:44.923 --> 03:32:47.443]  And this week, the NJEA is under fire.
[03:32:47.923 --> 03:32:50.884]  Teachers unions would have you believe that they're fighting for our children.
[03:32:51.384 --> 03:32:57.166]  But the evidence in these tapes show they're fighting for themselves, their survival, and their own dominance.
[03:33:05.914 --> 03:33:08.656]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.061 --> 03:33:21.307]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:33:21.407 --> 03:33:23.428]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.949 --> 03:33:27.632]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:30.703 --> 03:33:31.123]  We're back.
[03:33:31.183 --> 03:33:33.725]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:34.026 --> 03:33:38.529]  Now there's a very interesting article which came out yesterday and it's up on Infowars.com.
[03:33:38.969 --> 03:33:42.272]  South Koreans revolt against arrival of Muslim refugees.
[03:33:42.312 --> 03:33:50.778]  Now this is not really an issue that you hear a lot of in terms of Asian countries because of course they have very limited, very strict immigration.
[03:33:50.818 --> 03:33:56.643]  But as soon as it came to the fore in terms of 1,000 asylum seekers from Yemen,
[03:33:57.429 --> 03:34:00.112]  Basically turning up on a South Korean resort island.
[03:34:00.513 --> 03:34:02.555]  They absolutely freaked out!
[03:34:03.156 --> 03:34:03.396]  They had 520,000.
[03:34:03.737 --> 03:34:06.260]  In fact, this morning it's probably closer to 600,000.
[03:34:07.879 --> 03:34:08.840]  Sign a petition.
[03:34:09.380 --> 03:34:13.163]  Over half a million signed a petition asserting that Muslim migrants don't integrate.
[03:34:13.443 --> 03:34:14.384]  This is South Korea.
[03:34:14.724 --> 03:34:18.467]  And they don't want their country to end up like the UK or Germany.
[03:34:18.867 --> 03:34:22.710]  They literally had signs out on the street saying, we don't want to be like Europe.
[03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:28.195]  In fact, I'm probably going to make a video about this and I'll show you those signs probably tomorrow.
[03:34:28.855 --> 03:34:33.819]  But again, the controversy began when an influx of nearly 1,000 asylum seekers from Yemen, and to be fair,
[03:34:34.767 --> 03:34:52.167]  Yemen is in a civil war so a lot of these people will genuinely be refugees but some of them won't because of course to afford to get a flight to South Africa from a country like Yemen you have to be part of the middle class really, you have to be of wealth simply to afford those travel costs.
[03:34:52.547 --> 03:34:55.331]  But they arrived on the South Korean resort island of Jeju
[03:34:55.911 --> 03:35:03.819]  Because basically the government there, or the local government, changed the rules to say you didn't need a visa to go there on holiday.
[03:35:04.080 --> 03:35:09.225]  So they turned up as tourists, around 950 of them, the majority from Yemen.
[03:35:10.146 --> 03:35:15.792]  And of course now that this has got press attention, you will get others turning up as tourists and abusing the rules.
[03:35:16.559 --> 03:35:22.845]  To stay because one month they get a one month permit when they arrive as tourists, but then they immediately claim asylum.
[03:35:23.185 --> 03:35:27.509]  And of course, that process can take years while they remain in the country.
[03:35:27.549 --> 03:35:29.731]  And as we've seen in numerous other European countries.
[03:35:31.052 --> 03:35:36.057]  A sizable portion of these individuals just disappear and you never hear from them again.
[03:35:36.696 --> 03:35:42.717]  So they interviewed somebody called Hank Kim, who was the owner of the Core Travel Agency on that South Korean resort island.
[03:35:43.078 --> 03:35:44.678]  Basically, it's a holiday island.
[03:35:45.118 --> 03:35:46.838]  He said, the local people here are worried.
[03:35:47.199 --> 03:35:54.560]  We have read all about the problems that immigrants have caused in Europe, in Germany and France in particular, and we do not want that to happen here.
[03:35:55.060 --> 03:35:56.401]  This is one of the locals there.
[03:35:57.201 --> 03:36:05.363]  And he went on to emphasize that the limited amount of Muslim immigration they've had into South Korea, which is very limited compared to other countries in Europe,
[03:36:06.303 --> 03:36:14.149]  He said they all have big families and they bring their own culture instead of trying to adapt to the place where they live, which of course we know is true.
[03:36:14.930 --> 03:36:17.532]  Ghettoisation, no-go zones across Europe.
[03:36:17.712 --> 03:36:18.772]  It's a common phenomenon.
[03:36:18.853 --> 03:36:19.833]  It's no longer denied.
[03:36:19.873 --> 03:36:21.935]  They once tried to claim it was a conspiracy theory.
[03:36:22.255 --> 03:36:28.600]  It got so bad, ambulance crews, firemen were being attacked, police were being attacked, cars were being set on fire.
[03:36:29.324 --> 03:36:34.005]  No, they have to admit it's a reality in Sweden, in Germany, in all these other countries.
[03:36:34.325 --> 03:36:37.166]  So South Korea does not want to be like that.
[03:36:38.226 --> 03:36:46.188]  So over 120,000 people signed a petition, it's probably closer to 600,000 now, opposing the arrival of Muslim refugees.
[03:36:46.568 --> 03:36:49.069]  Then they had a protest in Seoul on Saturday.
[03:36:49.759 --> 03:36:52.722]  And that's from what I was talking about earlier with the signs.
[03:36:52.782 --> 03:37:00.730]  Literally, they were carrying signs that said, we don't want refugees, we don't want to be like Europe, we don't want to be like UK, we don't want to be like Germany.
[03:37:01.651 --> 03:37:04.734]  That's what those signs mean there that you're seeing right now in Korean.
[03:37:05.275 --> 03:37:09.379]  But there are also some in English off a different video, which I'm going to make a video about tomorrow, probably.
[03:37:10.288 --> 03:37:21.014]  So they also interviewed a professor at the Centre for Global Creation and Collaboration at Seoul Sangmyung University who attended the protest that I just mentioned.
[03:37:21.534 --> 03:37:29.979]  He said South Koreans wanted to avoid the same crisis that has befallen Europe who opened their borders to European countries who opened their borders to mass Islamic immigration.
[03:37:30.039 --> 03:37:30.679]  He said, quote,
[03:37:31.644 --> 03:37:39.737]  You've seen on television just how many problems are caused when a country like Germany or the UK is relaxed about immigration and the damage it does to societies.
[03:37:40.158 --> 03:37:42.041]  They asked him what he was talking about in particular.
[03:37:42.685 --> 03:37:46.749]  He mentioned paedophile grooming gangs, which of course are a huge problem across the UK.
[03:37:46.769 --> 03:37:47.649]  They're not dealt with.
[03:37:47.950 --> 03:37:51.453]  In many cases, they actually arrest the people who blow the whistle on them.
[03:37:51.993 --> 03:37:56.797]  And he mentioned terrorism as well, as two negative side effects that South Korea did not want to import.
[03:37:57.137 --> 03:38:01.321]  Don't see a lot of terrorism, or at least Islamic terrorism, in South Korea, do you?
[03:38:01.661 --> 03:38:04.103]  Don't see a lot of Islamic terrorism in Japan.
[03:38:04.404 --> 03:38:05.424]  Gee, I wonder why.
[03:38:05.444 --> 03:38:08.287]  Again, it goes back to the argument of
[03:38:09.341 --> 03:38:11.063]  Well, it's just a minority.
[03:38:11.123 --> 03:38:12.904]  Yeah, it only takes a minority.
[03:38:12.944 --> 03:38:16.968]  You look at every historical example, it only takes a minority for the problems to be huge.
[03:38:17.228 --> 03:38:18.430]  That's not the argument.
[03:38:18.550 --> 03:38:19.350]  It never has been.
[03:38:20.371 --> 03:38:26.197]  Now this view that South Koreans share, and they're obviously, you know, racist for doing so, even though they're not white.
[03:38:26.943 --> 03:38:29.806]  Is also shared by the majority of European citizens.
[03:38:29.846 --> 03:38:39.857]  We've talked about this poll before out of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, which is quite ironic because that's a big globalist group, which is probably pushing for mass immigration.
[03:38:41.622 --> 03:38:52.446]  55% of Europeans, if you ask across the countries, some countries it's more, some countries it's less, but the average is 55% of European citizens support a total ban on Muslim immigration.
[03:38:53.006 --> 03:39:04.531]  A total ban tomorrow on all Muslim immigration, the very thing that Trump mooted, that he suggested during his campaign run, is supported by the majority of Europeans right now.
[03:39:05.591 --> 03:39:06.572]  Now in South Korea,
[03:39:07.648 --> 03:39:12.310]  They had 9,942 people apply for refugee status last year.
[03:39:12.930 --> 03:39:18.172]  This year that's doubled according to the new statistics because of programmes like I mentioned earlier.
[03:39:19.172 --> 03:39:24.654]  But they only allowed 121 people to stay to claim asylum out of that near 10,000.
[03:39:26.323 --> 03:39:35.890]  So unlike European countries who basically accept way too many on quite dubious merits in a lot of cases, South Korea is saying no.
[03:39:36.350 --> 03:39:38.012]  The people of South Korea are saying no.
[03:39:38.172 --> 03:39:40.794]  Over half a million of them signed a petition saying no.
[03:39:41.214 --> 03:39:45.277]  And from what I've seen out of this story, it looks like the government is listening.
[03:39:45.637 --> 03:39:54.384]  They're going to cancel this ridiculous thing where you can just turn up as a tourist and then claim asylum on this South Korean island and then get shipped to the mainland.
[03:39:54.964 --> 03:39:58.385]  Looks like from the noises that they're making, they're going to stop this program.
[03:39:58.765 --> 03:40:02.566]  And South Korea has said no to mass Islamic immigration.
[03:40:02.906 --> 03:40:04.167]  That's not going to be in the news.
[03:40:04.207 --> 03:40:07.508]  It was in it was in Deutsch Well, which is a German publication.
[03:40:07.888 --> 03:40:09.648]  It was in, I think, the Korea Times.
[03:40:09.989 --> 03:40:15.450]  You don't see any discussion of this in a lot of big Western mainstream media publications, do you?
[03:40:15.510 --> 03:40:18.711]  Well, no, because they can't frame it as Islamophobia.
[03:40:18.991 --> 03:40:21.492]  They can't frame it as white supremacy.
[03:40:22.213 --> 03:40:25.516]  Or the far right, because it's happening in South Korea.
[03:40:26.817 --> 03:40:28.738]  Absolutely fascinating story.
[03:40:29.179 --> 03:40:39.467]  But again, par for the course when it comes to Asian countries, which obviously have very, very limited skilled immigration, which is what a lot of European countries want.
[03:40:39.907 --> 03:40:48.174]  And on that very subject, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini calls for anti-immigration alliance across Europe.
[03:40:48.954 --> 03:40:53.436]  Of course, he's the leader of the Liga party in Italy, which recently came to power.
[03:40:53.456 --> 03:41:01.500]  And he's basically turning the boats back in Libya, stopping the taxi service, literally picking them up from 10 miles off the Libyan coast.
[03:41:02.180 --> 03:41:16.467]  So he spoke to 50,000 supporters at the Liga Nord party conference recently and said, quote, I think of a League of Leagues in Europe, which unites all the free movements that want to defend their borders and the well-being of their children.
[03:41:17.057 --> 03:41:24.765]  So he's already got common cause in many European countries right now, including Poland, Austria, Czech Republic, the Visegrad countries.
[03:41:25.206 --> 03:41:30.111]  So there really is a split between the likes of Germany and France, old Europe and Italy.
[03:41:30.552 --> 03:41:33.275]  And he's calling for that to be cemented.
[03:41:33.955 --> 03:41:40.317]  As we saw in Germany where Merkel's interior minister basically revolted against her open border policies.
[03:41:40.757 --> 03:41:43.457]  It almost led to the collapse of Merkel's government.
[03:41:43.898 --> 03:41:49.559]  Now they've come to an agreement where they've basically closed the borders in Germany to a lot of these refugees.
[03:41:49.979 --> 03:41:57.561]  So everything is moving in the right direction in terms of border security and safety for a lot of European countries, which is why I say on a regular basis
[03:41:58.241 --> 03:42:00.663]  A lot of good news coming out of Europe right now.
[03:42:01.124 --> 03:42:04.606]  Not so much good news coming out of Paris, which is now a complete dump.
[03:42:05.527 --> 03:42:10.070]  Thieves rip gold teeth from man's mouth on streets of troubled Paris no-go zone.
[03:42:10.591 --> 03:42:15.955]  Remember back in, I think it was 2015, after Charlie Hebdo, the mainstream media said,
[03:42:16.653 --> 03:42:18.395]  Oh, there are no no-go zones in Paris.
[03:42:18.435 --> 03:42:19.276]  What are you talking about?
[03:42:19.696 --> 03:42:28.786]  Well, a 37-year-old man was the victim of a brutal attack Friday night in a Paris suburb when several people robbed him of his phone and ripped out four of his gold teeth.
[03:42:29.467 --> 03:42:30.648]  Now, these teeth are worth about...
[03:42:32.326 --> 03:42:40.212]  €50 each is about $58, so they just ripped out four of his teeth, basically, so they could get their hands on $200 or less.
[03:42:40.633 --> 03:42:41.874]  Paris is a total dump.
[03:42:42.254 --> 03:42:47.739]  They've literally got migrants on the streets, on mattresses, soaring crime, sexual assaults.
[03:42:48.179 --> 03:42:49.340]  They made the wrong decision.
[03:42:49.640 --> 03:42:54.844]  Salvini, Italy, made the right decision, and hopefully other European countries will do the same.
[03:42:55.105 --> 03:42:56.346]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:42:56.386 --> 03:42:56.866]  We'll be back.
[03:42:57.346 --> 03:42:58.207]  Infowars.com.
[03:42:58.227 --> 03:42:59.108]  Don't go away.
[03:43:04.386 --> 03:43:22.678]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm not gonna speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:22.778 --> 03:43:28.182]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:28.242 --> 03:43:29.743]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:29.843 --> 03:43:33.005]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:33.665 --> 03:43:34.646]  And so much more.
[03:43:35.206 --> 03:43:36.327]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:36.548 --> 03:43:38.269]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:38.289 --> 03:43:43.973]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:44.093 --> 03:43:45.294]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:45.314 --> 03:43:47.236]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:47.336 --> 03:43:49.698]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:49.918 --> 03:43:51.179]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:51.359 --> 03:43:53.160]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:53.721 --> 03:43:54.321]  Immune Wall.
[03:43:54.441 --> 03:43:55.742]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:55.862 --> 03:43:57.043]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:03.024 --> 03:44:06.006]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[03:44:06.266 --> 03:44:06.526]  Go ahead.
[03:44:06.786 --> 03:44:12.370]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[03:44:12.570 --> 03:44:13.670]  I'd done the War Room.
[03:44:13.971 --> 03:44:16.432]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[03:44:16.452 --> 03:44:18.013]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[03:44:18.053 --> 03:44:18.673]  I was exhausted.
[03:44:18.993 --> 03:44:22.255]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[03:44:22.596 --> 03:44:27.238]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[03:44:27.318 --> 03:44:29.360]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:29.900]  Same thing.
[03:44:30.060 --> 03:44:32.141]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[03:44:32.241 --> 03:44:33.482]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[03:44:33.642 --> 03:44:35.504]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[03:44:35.764 --> 03:44:41.768]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[03:44:41.808 --> 03:44:42.909]  You can sleep with it.
[03:44:43.209 --> 03:44:47.512]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[03:44:47.572 --> 03:44:50.374]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[03:44:50.514 --> 03:44:52.235]  This is the best combination I have found.
[03:44:52.335 --> 03:44:53.055]  It really works.
[03:44:53.275 --> 03:44:57.798]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[03:45:00.060 --> 03:45:00.440]  Believe me.
[03:45:02.621 --> 03:45:09.623]  Every week we're going to be profiling a different TV station, TV network, or cable station or network that's picking up InfoWars.
[03:45:10.023 --> 03:45:16.425]  We're on well over a hundred stations right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago.
[03:45:17.085 --> 03:45:22.867]  Now, one TV station that's actually been picking us up for several years that I want to profile first is Phonoscope.
[03:45:23.971 --> 03:45:30.729]  Phonoscope's creator and owner is the man that invented, more than 56 years ago, streaming
[03:45:31.724 --> 03:45:33.185]  Television over phone lines.
[03:45:33.465 --> 03:45:35.646]  That's why it's called Phonoscope and why it's patented.
[03:45:36.126 --> 03:45:42.009]  Well, he's got several channels and stations in Houston, and he's got us on 24 hours a day.
[03:45:42.969 --> 03:45:47.491]  On Phonoscope, channel 9 in Houston cable systems.
[03:45:47.971 --> 03:45:52.253]  So, we're talking a potential of 6 million people that are able to tune in.
[03:45:52.773 --> 03:45:54.034]  This is very, very exciting.
[03:45:54.114 --> 03:45:57.736]  So, to all of our listeners online, even if you're not in Houston,
[03:45:58.676 --> 03:46:07.581]  Be sure and tell any friends, family, or neighbors, or folks that you know who live in the Houston area, they can tune in to cable channel 9 to Phonoscope.
[03:46:07.961 --> 03:46:19.887]  Not just for my four-hour broadcast every day from our state-of-the-art TV and radio studios here in Austin, but to Owen Schroer, David Knight, and all the other shows, and all the other news, and anchors, and analysis that we're adding.
[03:46:20.327 --> 03:46:22.989]  So, Phonoscope is our oldest TV affiliate.
[03:46:23.749 --> 03:46:27.472]  They've been picking us up, I guess, for four years now, and so we really appreciate them.
[03:46:27.492 --> 03:46:29.554]  They're also one of our biggest, massive response.
[03:46:30.014 --> 03:46:45.807]  So to Lee Cook and the entire family down there at Phonoscope, we salute you, and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show and listeners of my show to tune into Phonoscope and also visit their website so you can find out about some of the other programs they put out, like Ron Paul's TV show.
[03:46:46.367 --> 03:46:46.708]  So again,
[03:46:47.188 --> 03:46:52.173]  From myself and the entire InfoWars crew in Austin, Texas, we salute Phonoscope in Houston.
[03:46:52.693 --> 03:46:54.214]  Thanks for all you're doing for this republic.
[03:46:54.495 --> 03:46:56.096]  You've helped make America great again.
[03:46:57.517 --> 03:47:01.501]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:05.965 --> 03:47:08.587]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.549 --> 03:47:33.375]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:33.415 --> 03:47:37.437]  This is the final segment of this fourth hour.
[03:47:37.517 --> 03:47:38.998]  War Room is coming up next.
[03:47:39.058 --> 03:47:46.703]  Before we get into a few final headlines, I want to tell you about the great 4th of July super sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:47.478 --> 03:47:57.464]  We're taking our country back from the hands of the globalist elite, and boy are they panicked about it, to celebrate how far we've come since the election of President Trump and the progress of this new American Revolution.
[03:47:57.484 --> 03:48:01.606]  We're bringing you powerful products and incredible discounts with free shipping.

[03:48:18.693 --> 03:48:21.153]  That is low stock, so it's not going to stick around for long.

[03:48:55.752 --> 03:48:57.033]  That is absolutely huge.
[03:48:57.434 --> 03:49:04.160]  They don't want you getting these products because, again, we're not dependent on big fat checks from globalists like George Soros.
[03:49:04.681 --> 03:49:11.907]  We're not dependent on Middle Eastern dictatorships funding us in return for free propaganda like CNN does.
[03:49:12.308 --> 03:49:14.770]  We're responsible and we're only
[03:49:14.770 --> 03:49:15.550]  Absolutely.
[03:49:31.104 --> 03:49:39.251]  Really important that you support us and continue to do so as we wade through these perilous times in world history.
[03:49:39.331 --> 03:49:41.453]  It really is getting very, very intense.
[03:49:41.473 --> 03:49:45.777]  So please continue to support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:49:45.817 --> 03:49:49.420]  Let's go for a few final news stories here.
[03:49:50.361 --> 03:49:51.662]  Now this story out of the UK.
[03:49:51.722 --> 03:49:57.067]  Westminster officials banned Trump from meeting Nigel Farage during UK presidential visit.
[03:49:57.785 --> 03:50:07.770]  The Prime Minister's staff organising next week's working visit are working to prevent President Donald Trump from having a meeting with Brexit leader Nigel Farage according to claims made Tuesday.
[03:50:08.491 --> 03:50:16.555]  Now they've denied it, but again, we have a situation in the UK where we've got skyrocketing crime, stabbings, acid attacks.
[03:50:16.975 --> 03:50:19.457]  It only seems to be getting worse as the weather gets warmer.
[03:50:19.857 --> 03:50:27.021]  We've got a Brexit deal which the Conservative government, Conservative in name only, has basically betrayed, torn up and incinerated.
[03:50:27.481 --> 03:50:29.463]  The democratic mandate of the British people.
[03:50:29.783 --> 03:50:32.706]  That's what Theresa May should be concentrating on.
[03:50:33.026 --> 03:50:40.012]  Instead, she's apparently, according to this report, concentrating on deciding who Nigel Farage can meet in his spare time.
[03:50:40.332 --> 03:50:40.532]  No.
[03:50:40.852 --> 03:50:43.134]  Stick to what you were elected for.
[03:50:43.395 --> 03:50:45.897]  Stick to what we voted for back two years ago.
[03:50:46.277 --> 03:50:50.801]  Stop posse-footing around deciding what Nigel Farage and Donald Trump get up to.
[03:50:51.761 --> 03:50:52.822]  None in your business!
[03:50:53.162 --> 03:50:58.544]  Donald Trump can meet whoever the hell he wants while he's here in his own spare private time.
[03:50:59.004 --> 03:51:03.867]  Meanwhile, Cameron personally requested Obama's back-of-the-queue Brexit warning.
[03:51:04.507 --> 03:51:15.832]  The former key aide to Barack Obama has confirmed David Cameron, former Prime Minister of Britain of course, personally asked the US President to warn Britain would be back-of-the-queue for a post-Brexit trade deal.
[03:51:16.474 --> 03:51:27.098]  Ben Rhodes, an ex-White House adviser, admitted Mr Obama's dramatic intervention in the EU referendum campaign came at the personal request of the former Prime Minister.
[03:51:28.098 --> 03:51:36.641]  Which, of course, happened in April 2016, just two months before the Brexit vote, where Obama gave the speech and said the UK is going to be at the back of the queue.
[03:51:36.921 --> 03:51:40.062]  Well, it turns out that wasn't the case, because you lost.
[03:51:40.162 --> 03:51:41.202]  Hillary Clinton lost.
[03:51:41.603 --> 03:51:42.883]  But again, what does this tell us?
[03:51:43.672 --> 03:51:47.575]  Foreign meddling interfering with the democratic process.
[03:51:47.935 --> 03:51:49.276]  That's literally what we have here.
[03:51:49.717 --> 03:51:55.982]  Actual proof of a foreign power meddling in our sovereign democratic process.
[03:51:56.322 --> 03:51:57.783]  Not talking about Russian collusion.
[03:51:58.003 --> 03:52:06.550]  I'm talking about Barack Obama scheming with David Cameron to meddle in our democratic process in the UK when it came to Brexit.
[03:52:06.890 --> 03:52:11.194]  Bombshell admitted proof of foreign collusion.
[03:52:11.374 --> 03:52:12.855]  Is anybody talking about that now?
[03:52:13.015 --> 03:52:13.715]  Now, no.
[03:52:14.256 --> 03:52:15.456]  Nobody's talking about it.
[03:52:15.656 --> 03:52:17.797]  They're still talking about this Mueller investigation.
[03:52:18.477 --> 03:52:22.279]  Admit a proof of foreign collusion right there, bang, in your face.
[03:52:23.039 --> 03:52:31.003]  Meanwhile, talking about Trump, and this ties into Trump because we've got his visit next week in the UK, not an official state visit because
[03:52:31.849 --> 03:52:36.953]  Basically, the Conservative government is scared that everyone will freak out, which they will, because they're complete idiots.
[03:52:36.973 --> 03:52:37.853]  There'll be protests.
[03:52:38.334 --> 03:52:40.875]  There may indeed be small-scale riots.
[03:52:41.416 --> 03:52:43.457]  But over in Turkey, this ties into it.
[03:52:43.938 --> 03:52:46.459]  Istanbul police shoot rubber bullets and tear gas.
[03:52:46.960 --> 03:52:50.462]  Sick dogs on gay pride marches in Istanbul.
[03:52:50.922 --> 03:52:53.144]  So they banned the gay pride march again.
[03:52:53.584 --> 03:52:58.648]  The 16th annual gay pride march, like they did for the past four years in Istanbul, Turkey.
[03:52:59.395 --> 03:53:01.295]  It attracted 100,000 people in 2014.
[03:53:01.776 --> 03:53:03.876]  This year, 10,000 people showed up.
[03:53:04.356 --> 03:53:06.137]  In fact, only 1,000 showed up.
[03:53:06.737 --> 03:53:07.437]  And what did they do?
[03:53:07.637 --> 03:53:12.898]  They used tear gas, they used rubber bullets, they used dogs to try to disperse the crowd.
[03:53:13.538 --> 03:53:15.579]  Erdogan's thugs also brought out the police dogs.
[03:53:15.599 --> 03:53:19.160]  They broke it up, basically pointed guns at the protesters.
[03:53:20.140 --> 03:53:22.580]  The video's over at Gateway Pundit if you want to watch it.
[03:53:22.981 --> 03:53:24.501]  Who's going to be protesting that?
[03:53:25.572 --> 03:53:26.092]  Nobody!
[03:53:26.612 --> 03:53:31.674]  Is the LGBT lobby in London going to march on the Turkish embassy in London?
[03:53:32.014 --> 03:53:32.554]  No, they're not.
[03:53:32.614 --> 03:53:43.998]  They're going to be protesting against Donald Trump, a guy who literally appoints gay people to high positions of influence within his administration, as we saw with the ambassador a couple of months ago.
[03:53:44.538 --> 03:53:50.980]  They're going to be protesting the guy who literally waves a rainbow flag around on stage, which happened during his campaign.
[03:53:51.340 --> 03:54:06.084]  Are they going to be protesting against a government, against a belief system that persecutes gays on a regular basis, that fires tear gas at them, that fires rubber bullets at them, that sicks dogs at them, simply for trying to get out on the streets and have a parade?
[03:54:06.404 --> 03:54:06.604]  No.
[03:54:06.844 --> 03:54:08.104]  They don't give a damn about that.
[03:54:08.305 --> 03:54:11.826]  They give a damn about Trump because they've got Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:54:12.046 --> 03:54:13.386]  They're told what to think.
[03:54:13.766 --> 03:54:19.630]  Nobody's going to be protesting the anti-gay persecution of people in Istanbul, Turkey, are they?
[03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:21.971]  Nobody's going to be marching on the Saudi embassy.
[03:54:22.351 --> 03:54:25.213]  Nobody's going to be marching on the Turkish embassy.
[03:54:25.493 --> 03:54:28.195]  Complete hypocrisy through and through.
[03:54:28.215 --> 03:54:31.697]  Another story out of Breitbart here.
[03:54:31.717 --> 03:54:33.318]  In fact, we've got a clip that we can play.
[03:54:33.358 --> 03:54:35.619]  This is the Polish lawmaker clip.
[03:54:36.238 --> 03:54:36.418]  Zero.
[03:55:03.447 --> 03:55:04.367]  And you're proud of that?
[03:55:05.147 --> 03:55:14.850]  If you are asking me about Muslims' illegal immigration, none, not even one, will come to Poland.
[03:55:14.910 --> 03:55:16.430]  Not even one if it's illegal.
[03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:21.971]  We took over 2 million Ukrainians who are working, who are peaceful in Poland.
[03:55:22.291 --> 03:55:25.872]  We will not receive even one Muslim because this is what we promised.
[03:55:26.172 --> 03:55:28.716]  Did I ask not about illegal immigrants?
[03:55:28.856 --> 03:55:30.218]  I asked about refugees.
[03:55:30.498 --> 03:55:34.324]  And Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission President, says that you're racist.
[03:55:34.885 --> 03:55:38.050]  You sound proud of the fact that you haven't taken any refugees.
[03:55:40.180 --> 03:55:43.883]  Of course, because this is what our people are expecting from our government.
[03:55:43.903 --> 03:55:44.664]  That's number one.
[03:55:45.164 --> 03:55:47.606]  This is why our government was elected.
[03:55:48.366 --> 03:55:50.448]  This is why Poland is so safe.
[03:55:50.989 --> 03:55:55.692]  This is the reason why we have not even one terrorist attack.
[03:55:55.992 --> 03:55:57.394]  Look at the streets in Poland.
[03:55:57.514 --> 03:56:01.917]  And we can be called populists, nationalists, racists.
[03:56:02.097 --> 03:56:02.718]  I don't care.
[03:56:03.018 --> 03:56:05.380]  I care about my family and about my country.
[03:56:06.664 --> 03:56:12.807]  Not many terrorist attacks in Poland, not many giant grooming gangs sweeping the country in Poland are there.
[03:56:12.927 --> 03:56:14.128]  That's interesting, isn't it?
[03:56:14.508 --> 03:56:27.995]  And of course the media, and in that case Cathy Newman, use the term refugees when they know, they know that even according to the UN's own figures, the vast majority of these people who they call refugees are not refugees, they're economic migrants.
[03:56:28.355 --> 03:56:35.458]  They can only afford to pay the criminal people smugglers in the first place because they've at least got some wealth within their own countries.
[03:56:35.758 --> 03:56:47.201]  They're not refugees, they're trying to flee to the European welfare states and in fact in the process harming their own countries because a lot of them are essentially middle class within those countries and they're fleeing.
[03:56:47.382 --> 03:56:52.283]  Absolutely incredible situation but the resistance against it is building.
[03:56:52.323 --> 03:56:53.564]  Here's a story out of Germany.
[03:56:53.644 --> 03:56:57.325]  Thousands of Germans protest against Merkel and migration in Cottbus.
[03:56:58.001 --> 03:57:03.703]  After several migrant-related incidents, the people of Cottbus took to the streets Sunday to protest against Merkel's migration policy.
[03:57:04.363 --> 03:57:12.966]  German community organisation protesters throughout the city with demonstrators calling out, Merkel must leave, we are the people, and deport.
[03:57:13.692 --> 03:57:15.753]  So there are huge protests going on against this.
[03:57:16.193 --> 03:57:29.816]  We have the situation in Italy with Salvini where him and the Five Star Movement, the coalition government, are hugely popular for instituting these measures whereby they at least have some sense of border security and sovereignty.
[03:57:30.176 --> 03:57:31.997]  The populist wave is sweeping Europe.
[03:57:32.257 --> 03:57:36.338]  You cannot stop it at this point by merely invoking the words racist
[03:57:37.205 --> 03:57:39.247]  Or populist, or nationalist.
[03:57:39.547 --> 03:57:40.167]  It doesn't work.
[03:57:40.388 --> 03:57:44.711]  People have rejected your globalism, and that rejection is only going to build.
[03:57:44.731 --> 03:57:47.473]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:47.533 --> 03:57:51.436]  War Room with Owen Troyer is coming up live in 4Wars.com.
[03:57:57.301 --> 03:58:02.705]  Now we acknowledge in this country that we can't, we cannot accept this.
[03:58:03.386 --> 03:58:05.047]  I can't do a wolf, I'm sorry.
[03:58:05.327 --> 03:58:06.048]  We can't do it.
[03:58:06.801 --> 03:58:07.221]  Puffs.
[03:58:10.363 --> 03:58:17.008]  And... The Oscar goes to... What was your response, Thelma?
[03:58:17.128 --> 03:58:18.469]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[03:58:18.769 --> 03:58:21.291]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[03:58:21.631 --> 03:58:23.252]  Well, Trey Gowdy oughta have his a** kicked.
[03:58:25.854 --> 03:58:27.775]  I am a proud s**tholer.
[03:58:30.057 --> 03:58:32.818]  S**tholers built this country 110 years ago.
[03:58:32.939 --> 03:58:34.840]  They were called slopers and slant-eyes.
[03:58:38.339 --> 03:58:48.627]  The National Institute of Standards and Technology acknowledged that the World Trade Center Building 7 fell off freefall acceleration for over 100 feet on 9-11, which means it was meeting no resistance for eight stories.
[03:58:49.068 --> 03:58:56.594]  So, sparing me a diatribe about conspiracy theories, can you please give me a straight answer on how you think that's scientifically possible without the use of explosives?
