[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:00.750]  We've got it.
[00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.255]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:09.397]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:17.364]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:27.107 --> 00:00:51.841]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:53.642]  The President
[00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:57.844]  ...has come out and the President has defended Infowars.
[00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:01.325]  The President has defended Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.427]  The video of that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:07.988]  It's posted to newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:13.051]  We also have the unbelievably incredible information.
[00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:14.872]  This just broke on infowars.com.
[00:01:15.272 --> 00:01:19.674]  Donald Trump, authorities investigating possible election fraud in Florida.
[00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:26.155]  They have caught the Democrats with giant trucks.
[00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.178]  We're going to be rolling that video next segment as well.
[00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:31.620]  We can b-roll some of it now for TV viewers.
[00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:33.902]  Videos posted on Infowars.com.
[00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:36.304]  Florida.
[00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:44.183]  is at the center of explosive post-election fight and Arizona suddenly, the Senate seat is in question.
[00:01:44.783 --> 00:02:01.007]  Just like they fraudulently tried to keep Kavanaugh from getting appointed and getting confirmed, and they've been caught lying in that case, they are back at it, ladies and gentlemen, with 18-wheelers and trucks, with private individuals delivering the magic ballots that are needed.
[00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.868]  The question is, would Democrats engage in election fraud?
[00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:05.972]  That's what they do.
[00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:09.036]  I mean, we've caught them all over Texas, everywhere else this election cycle.
[00:02:09.537 --> 00:02:10.558]  This is unbelievable.
[00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.801]  So found magically.
[00:02:13.422 --> 00:02:15.384]  Magic ballots swing Florida.
[00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:21.833]  They're set to lose the governorship they won, the Senate seat, the Ag Commissioner, everything.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:33.509]  Who is the leading expert on Democrat fraud in the state of Florida who led George W. Bush's operation in 2000 and successfully exposed it and took it to the Supreme Court?
[00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.090]  Roger Stone.
[00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:40.775]  Yes, a man of many trades, many hats, hated by the left.
[00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:43.698]  He'll be joining us on the ground.
[00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.962]  From Florida, ladies and gentlemen, where this is happening, where he predicted it would, Broward County.
[00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:55.325]  He said, on Tuesday night, he said, I fear they're going to find a bunch of magic ballots.
[00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:57.306]  And then, they looked like they conceded.
[00:02:57.326 --> 00:03:00.068]  And he said, wow, they've never conceded before.
[00:03:00.108 --> 00:03:00.928]  They always stuff.
[00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:02.969]  They always discover magic ballots.
[00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.730]  That's where he lives.
[00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.551]  Well, lo and behold, they sucker punched us.
[00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.193]  They waited until we looked away, and then...
[00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:13.435]  Dun-da-da-dun, da-da-dun, da-da-dun, da-da-dun.
[00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:16.436]  Here comes the Enterprise big truck.
[00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:21.497]  And now it's getting loaded up with all those magic ballots.
[00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:23.358]  They're so magical.
[00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:25.078]  They're so helpful.
[00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:28.519]  And they're just in the exact targeted places.
[00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.441]  Oh, and they're overwhelmingly, now that the recount's happening, they're overwhelming for the Democrats.
[00:03:36.021 --> 00:03:38.602]  This is amazing!
[00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.710]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.452]  It's all completely transparent.
[00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:47.814]  It's all completely obvious.
[00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.257]  Magic found ballots could swing the state.
[00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:58.982]  Shocking video footage shows Florida ballots transported by private vehicles being transferred into a rental truck on election night.
[00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:02.705]  The great Michael Snyder reports that into theamericandream.com.
[00:04:02.745 --> 00:04:04.687]  It's posted on infowars.com.
[00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:06.128]  Now that's it.
[00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:11.824]  Antifa has expanded its hit list of people they're going to target with violent threats.
[00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:19.892]  Like Paul Watson tweeted when the mafia comes to you and says, we know where you live, hope nothing happens to your kids.
[00:04:21.493 --> 00:04:22.374]  It's called racketeering.
[00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:29.700]  When they come to your house and bash you in part of your door and say, we know you live here, you're not safe, you hurt children, your children will get hurt.
[00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:32.382]  Well then, it's okay, see?
[00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:34.407]  It's okay then.
[00:04:35.147 --> 00:04:38.150]  It's okay because they're funded by George Soros and his nasty little son.
[00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.371]  So it's alright.
[00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:41.893]  The mainstream corporate media then defends them.
[00:04:41.913 --> 00:04:45.776]  So we're going to be breaking it all down today.
[00:04:45.836 --> 00:04:48.718]  There's so much more I haven't gotten into as well.
[00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:54.062]  The latest from our good friend Nancy Pelosi and the new acting Attorney General.
[00:04:54.082 --> 00:04:55.223]  What's got the globalists so scared?
[00:04:55.704 --> 00:04:56.564]  Why are they so scared?
[00:04:56.944 --> 00:04:57.285]  Find out.
[00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:01.817]  You need to support independent media that's under attack.
[00:05:01.857 --> 00:05:05.279]  We're under attack by these globalists, as you know, and your support's been amazing.
[00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.701]  We make it easy to support us because we have great products.
[00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:18.568]  And we're announcing a mega blowout sale at Infowarsstore.com to fund us into the new year so we have a budget to continue on in the face of their attacks.
[00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.090]  Super male and super female vitality.
[00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.793]  It's incredibly high-quality cold-pressed herbs known for strength, stamina, libido, energy.
[00:05:27.073 --> 00:05:27.554]  It's amazing.
[00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:31.656]  It is a whopping 57% off.
[00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:34.098]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, super high-quality.
[00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:35.118]  The best out there.
[00:05:35.178 --> 00:05:36.139]  Never gone this low.
[00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.561]  67% off to blow it all out.
[00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:43.084]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:14.025]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:21.452 --> 00:06:30.100]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.632 --> 00:06:39.763]  It's Friday, the ninth day of November 2018, and oh, the Republicans had won the three Senate seats.
[00:06:45.118 --> 00:06:59.611]  And, well, there'd only been 26 losses in the House, and magically then, as soon as we all turned away, 18 wheelers in Arizona, California, and Florida came rolling in, and the ballots magically being counted.
[00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:03.294]  In some cases, in some precincts, are 100% Democrat! 100%!
[00:07:10.453 --> 00:07:19.762]  And magically, looks like the Republicans might lose two of their senators, two of their governors, and a bunch of other key races.
[00:07:21.644 --> 00:07:22.765]  Man, oh man!
[00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:24.346]  My, oh my!
[00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:28.370]  Isn't that just horrible?
[00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:35.056]  And Donald Trump says he has dispatched Homeland Security to investigate possible election fraud.
[00:07:36.124 --> 00:07:39.866]  That's like asking, how do you know when CNN is lying?
[00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:44.848]  It's when you dial their channel and you can bet it's distortion and lies.
[00:07:44.868 --> 00:07:50.390]  It's the old joke, when it's Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton lying, it's when their lips are moving, but it's worse than that.
[00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:54.112]  They're constantly waging war against reality.
[00:07:55.593 --> 00:08:03.036]  It is the corporate fake press's job to not just lie to us, but then to distort and lie about any real media.
[00:08:04.366 --> 00:08:06.528]  And then to try to have it censored off the air.
[00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:13.856]  So we have all this incredible news, Antifa expanding, it's violent hit list, as political violence escalates, that's the Washington Times.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.986]  So everything is getting out of control at an accelerated rate.
[00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:26.330]  We have massive Islamic invasion news in Europe.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:35.885]  We have Venezuela collapsing into beyond Road Warrior, beyond Thunderdome type scenarios.
[00:08:40.027 --> 00:08:51.294]  We have Trump signing an executive order saying that those in the illegal caravan will not be given the option of applying for political or religious
[00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:55.530]  Persecution because they're coming as part of an organized criminal mob.
[00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:02.818]  And so he's saying under an executive order, which he has the total power to do, presidents over that, over immigration, over the borders, that that will not be accepted.
[00:09:02.838 --> 00:09:09.986]  They'll have a bunch of lawsuits filed, but those two will make their way to the Supreme Court and will be overthrown.
[00:09:10.447 --> 00:09:11.668]  All the other judges below will
[00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:13.827]  We're good to go.
[00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:38.733]  This is all over Russian news.
[00:09:38.813 --> 00:09:40.154]  It's all over Japanese news.
[00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:42.196]  It's all over European news.
[00:09:42.256 --> 00:09:43.357]  It's all over U.S.
[00:09:43.397 --> 00:09:43.657]  news.
[00:09:44.357 --> 00:09:45.378]  It's everywhere.
[00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:52.544]  I start getting calls yesterday morning at my house saying, did you doctor the video?
[00:09:53.665 --> 00:09:54.605]  And I said, what video?
[00:09:55.446 --> 00:10:02.231]  And it was Paul Watson zooming in on the video everybody saw live of Jim Acosta pushing the woman's arm down.
[00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:04.273]  It was kind of a light push karate shot.
[00:10:05.902 --> 00:10:06.263]  I don't know.
[00:10:21.027 --> 00:10:26.272]  Of so-called video experts get up and say that we sped it up and then slowed it down.
[00:10:26.973 --> 00:10:27.533]  Um, no.
[00:10:28.154 --> 00:10:29.455]  I've taken Watson's video.
[00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:31.056]  I've looked at the raw HD we have.
[00:10:31.477 --> 00:10:37.442]  They're exactly the same, except for seven dropped frames throughout the thousands of frames.
[00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:41.066]  Remember, there's 25 frames per second.
[00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:47.372]  And we went and looked at it, and that's what happens when you upload stuff to Twitter.
[00:10:47.512 --> 00:10:50.273]  It has a crappy video system, as everyone knows.
[00:10:50.513 --> 00:10:56.014]  You shoot beautiful HD, you upload it, it loses a bunch of quality, dropped frames are in there.
[00:10:56.434 --> 00:10:59.315]  Everybody sees us live on TV when I say, oh, this clip just came in.
[00:10:59.355 --> 00:11:02.816]  We play it, and there's glitches, and the audio's off.
[00:11:04.316 --> 00:11:05.837]  Sometimes it does it really bad.
[00:11:06.397 --> 00:11:08.417]  It's just the way different systems work together.
[00:11:08.437 --> 00:11:09.258]  A lot of them don't integrate.
[00:11:10.098 --> 00:11:10.738]  But with Paul,
[00:11:11.877 --> 00:11:17.242]  He just zooms it in, but then the so-called experts go, but we looked and there was edits.
[00:11:17.803 --> 00:11:24.510]  Now, other top experts have come out in newspapers and said, no, those are dropped frames, which is normal with compression on different internet formats.
[00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.615]  It has not been doctored in a way to be doctored where they're trying to change the meaning of it.
[00:11:30.115 --> 00:11:35.661]  This is what happens when you blow video up on cheap editing systems and then you upload it to Twitter.
[00:11:36.201 --> 00:11:37.082]  And God love Paul.
[00:11:37.142 --> 00:11:37.542]  He's great.
[00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:38.183]  He does so much work.
[00:11:38.203 --> 00:11:39.164]  He's a one-man wrecking crew.
[00:11:39.444 --> 00:11:40.385]  I've offered him better equipment.
[00:11:40.405 --> 00:11:41.225]  I've offered him crew.
[00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:42.346]  He doesn't want to do it.
[00:11:42.366 --> 00:11:44.969]  Because I would have grabbed it HD and uploaded it HD.
[00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:46.390]  We like to do stuff HD.
[00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.472]  Then there wouldn't be any drop frames or any problems.
[00:11:48.532 --> 00:11:49.813]  But it doesn't matter!
[00:11:50.754 --> 00:12:01.043]  Jim Acosta, in front of the whole world, wouldn't sit down, had asked three questions, was argumentative, wouldn't give her the microphone back, and pushed a woman and shoved her.
[00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:03.702]  There's three actions there.
[00:12:04.703 --> 00:12:18.628]  And that they would think in the corporate media that they would change the subject and say in thousands of new- BBC, London Telegraph, Guardian, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, Dallas Morning News, Austin American Statesman, everything!
[00:12:18.848 --> 00:12:19.689]  Just thousands!
[00:12:20.149 --> 00:12:24.251]  Alex Jones caught in another lie, editing video, Acosta didn't touch her!
[00:12:26.331 --> 00:12:32.494]  When everyone can watch the HD footage everywhere, you can clearly see he did it, but this is how they do distraction.
[00:12:36.007 --> 00:12:42.192]  And then they had all these other people come out again and say, I'm an expert, I'm an expert, I'm an expert.
[00:12:42.232 --> 00:12:43.373]  Look, they edited it.
[00:12:43.413 --> 00:12:46.475]  And then they would edit it to say that we edited it.
[00:12:47.196 --> 00:12:50.298]  But all these other experts have come out and said, no, it's the exact same link.
[00:12:50.599 --> 00:12:51.700]  It's the exact same time.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.962]  Watson's video is a little washed out because of crappy compression.
[00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:55.923]  That's it.
[00:12:59.266 --> 00:12:59.566]  That's it.
[00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:04.550]  But we have to sit here and spend time on this because this is the mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:17.323]  This is the mind control where everyone saw him push the woman, shove her arm down and pull back away from her and keep talking until the president had to get involved.
[00:13:17.523 --> 00:13:19.844]  Corey Lewandowski barely touched a woman.
[00:13:20.044 --> 00:13:21.744]  There's six frames of video.
[00:13:21.964 --> 00:13:24.365]  You've got a pause and maybe he touched her.
[00:13:25.105 --> 00:13:26.885]  Maybe he kind of went like that.
[00:13:26.905 --> 00:13:28.726]  How did that go through crowds all the time?
[00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:30.806]  This turns into end of the world.
[00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:33.387]  Donald Trump's people are brutalizing women.
[00:13:33.787 --> 00:13:34.567]  Acosta does.
[00:13:36.145 --> 00:13:37.867]  500 times the action.
[00:13:38.047 --> 00:13:39.668]  We're not even sure Lewandowski did anything.
[00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:43.871]  Let's just say he brushed her, his hand, like two seconds, you know, milliseconds, six frames.
[00:13:45.753 --> 00:13:46.914]  Just barely touched her.
[00:13:48.715 --> 00:13:53.019]  This is clear in front of everyone, and they change the subject and say, you didn't see that.
[00:13:54.116 --> 00:13:54.416]  No!
[00:13:55.316 --> 00:14:05.578]  Alex Jones, the evil mastermind, he went in and showed it accelerate and then showed it slow down to make it look worse than it was.
[00:14:06.018 --> 00:14:06.678]  Worse than it was!
[00:14:06.818 --> 00:14:08.839]  Acosta says he didn't touch her!
[00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:17.260]  Even Fox News came out and said, yeah, the evil Alex Jones, because they're in competition, folks, with independent media.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.781]  They all know what they're doing.
[00:14:18.981 --> 00:14:19.421]  But you know what?
[00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:20.261]  The president isn't.
[00:14:21.846 --> 00:14:24.468]  And Paul's tweeted this video out at Prison Planet.
[00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:25.008]  Paul's Twitter.
[00:14:25.248 --> 00:14:26.309]  Nobody manipulated it.
[00:14:26.369 --> 00:14:27.029]  Give me a break.
[00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.509]  See?
[00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.631]  That just is dishonest reporting.
[00:14:29.991 --> 00:14:31.011]  I watched it last night.
[00:14:31.512 --> 00:14:32.692]  They made it close up.
[00:14:32.953 --> 00:14:34.053]  That's not doctoring.
[00:14:34.954 --> 00:14:36.295]  We're going to play the President in a moment.
[00:14:36.915 --> 00:14:50.183]  But coming up... In the next hour, we have caught Media Matters and George Soros 100% doctoring a video about Owen Schroer and calling for us to be removed off of the air.
[00:14:51.428 --> 00:14:53.389]  They said that we bullied a black family.
[00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:59.070]  The people came over, pushed Owen for no reason, got in his face.
[00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.611]  Owen said, oh my gosh, well, that's bizarre behavior from you.
[00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:05.112]  And then, but they cut the front off, see?
[00:15:06.912 --> 00:15:14.414]  Just like the Mexican supremacist said, you're white, you're subhuman, you're a monkey, your mother's married to her brother, you're total scum, gringo, you're going down.
[00:15:14.434 --> 00:15:15.675]  I said, man, you're really racist?
[00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:16.195]  They cut it.
[00:15:16.595 --> 00:15:19.976]  Facebook's official system cut it up, made it look like I was attacking Hispanic women.
[00:15:21.323 --> 00:15:22.383]  Let's go out to break with the president.
[00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:22.863]  Here he is.
[00:15:23.844 --> 00:15:25.864]  The tape video of Costa?
[00:15:26.044 --> 00:15:28.305]  What are you talking about?
[00:15:29.385 --> 00:15:30.005]  All that was?
[00:15:30.525 --> 00:15:31.786]  Nobody manipulated it.
[00:15:31.826 --> 00:15:32.646]  Give me a break.
[00:15:33.006 --> 00:15:34.726]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:15:34.987 --> 00:15:36.327]  All that is is a close-up.
[00:15:36.647 --> 00:15:39.648]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:15:40.068 --> 00:15:40.748]  I watched that.
[00:15:40.808 --> 00:15:41.868]  I heard that last night.
[00:15:42.188 --> 00:15:43.429]  They made it close-up.
[00:15:43.469 --> 00:15:44.629]  They showed it close-up.
[00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:46.990]  And he was not nice to that young woman.
[00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.970]  I don't hold him for that.
[00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.351]  Because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.
[00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:55.393]  But all that was, when you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy.
[00:15:55.613 --> 00:15:57.593]  Because it wasn't doctor- Thanks for sticking up for us.
[00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:04.596]  You have the idea for this.
[00:16:05.316 --> 00:16:09.318]  We delivered 100,000 signatures a year and a half ago to the-
[00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:16.000]  It had a massive, massive effect and got him moving on the censorship.
[00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:25.926]  But you have the idea of, this is a model others have used, it's a handwritten letter, they sign their name, they can print off a copy for free, they mail that, or they don't, we mail it for them.
[00:16:26.246 --> 00:16:28.467]  So either it's two letters go out every time we do it, or one.
[00:16:28.707 --> 00:16:29.948]  We're going to send one out regardless.
[00:16:30.408 --> 00:16:35.271]  With the postage paid in an individual letter, one million of these to flood the White House.
[00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:38.393]  I think we're going to send about $100,000 to Trump Tower in New York.
[00:16:39.113 --> 00:16:41.356]  And it is almost a form of harassment, but we love the president.
[00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.137]  We're doing him a favor.
[00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:43.478]  WriteTrump.com.
[00:16:43.618 --> 00:16:47.843]  I'm going to hammer the White House with a million of these, okay?
[00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:48.604]  I'm not playing games.
[00:16:48.864 --> 00:16:50.046]  One million, and I know you'll do it.
[00:16:50.246 --> 00:16:51.287]  We did it last time.
[00:16:51.307 --> 00:16:52.969]  Got 100,000 signatures in a week.
[00:16:53.089 --> 00:16:56.493]  Then we printed them off, and we mailed them, and it showed up, and it was a big fiasco.
[00:16:56.693 --> 00:16:57.494]  I don't like doing this.
[00:16:57.674 --> 00:16:58.294]  I have to do it.
[00:16:58.594 --> 00:17:00.816]  He's going to be knee-deep in these things.
[00:17:00.956 --> 00:17:06.761]  If you take action, write Trump.com, sign your name on the letter to the President that we will mail for you directly to the President.
[00:17:06.821 --> 00:17:18.830]  President Trump must understand the importance of putting a stop to this mass censorship of the service by Big Tech and initiate antitrust actions to end this racketeering and collusion by the Big Tech giants desperate to take back America.
[00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:21.612]  I've already had top law firms write him three briefings.
[00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:23.853]  I've already had them delivered.
[00:17:23.873 --> 00:17:25.735]  I already know that he picked up on
[00:17:26.215 --> 00:17:40.508]  Wait, if the EU and the UN are already regulating our internet because we haven't put regulations on saying there is no regulation, then we've allowed them to come in tacitly or by fiat or by vacuum and begin regulating.
[00:17:40.548 --> 00:17:43.250]  He said that just a few days ago that he's looking at antitrust because it's
[00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.911]  We're good to go.
[00:17:59.207 --> 00:18:00.328]  Remove those protections.
[00:18:00.668 --> 00:18:08.655]  It's allowed those to come in so they can come in with fines and regulations to bring our tech DARPA CIA command operation under their control.
[00:18:08.695 --> 00:18:09.576]  That's what this is all about.
[00:18:09.636 --> 00:18:11.477]  Make no mistake, that's what all these institutions are.
[00:18:11.577 --> 00:18:14.360]  And so we're demanding the president retake control of U.S.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.442]  hardware in this modern fight, right?
[00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:17.643]  Trump.com.
[00:18:17.703 --> 00:18:20.345]  Again, we know exactly where to hit the enemy.
[00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:22.587]  Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
[00:18:23.067 --> 00:18:23.948]  That's why they hate us.
[00:18:24.028 --> 00:18:28.913]  We're loyal to America, we know what we're doing, and the enemy is completely and absolutely scared.
[00:18:28.993 --> 00:18:32.577]  So go to RightTrump.com today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:32.697 --> 00:18:35.159]  And don't forget, we have the biggest targeted sale.
[00:18:35.219 --> 00:18:40.405]  Not the biggest general sale, but on six items, it is the biggest sale ever.
[00:18:40.425 --> 00:18:41.666]  67% off a colloidal silver-silver bullet.
[00:18:42.147 --> 00:18:43.989]  About 57% off of Supermel's Perfume of Vitality.
[00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:45.751]  It's incredible, but I want to move it all.
[00:18:45.912 --> 00:18:46.412]  I'll tell you why.
[00:18:46.432 --> 00:18:48.235]  They're trying to take our payment processes and shut us down.
[00:18:48.515 --> 00:18:51.439]  I have to sell out all of our product now before they're successful.
[00:18:51.479 --> 00:18:52.100]  I pray they're not.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.887]  We've got to move it all out, the fund, to the next junk phase and new funding I've secured in the new year.
[00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:09.114]  Owen Schroer here for InfoWars.com and I want to tell you guys about a great product that we have and it is the Knockout Sleep Aid Formula.
[00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:19.158]  Now, I've got my Knockout right here and we're going to take it and we're going to look at the actual results of the Knockout Sleep Formula in real time.
[00:19:19.218 --> 00:19:22.119]  So let me take my Knockout first.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.062]  But while we're waiting to see the effects of the Knockout,
[00:19:31.982 --> 00:19:39.967]  I've got some very, very, very important news that I want to get to.
[00:19:41.088 --> 00:19:48.152]  InfoWarsLife wants to bring you a sleep support formula that goes above and beyond other leading brands at an affordable price.
[00:19:48.573 --> 00:19:51.875]  Get the sleep you deserve and experience the power of knockout.
[00:19:52.015 --> 00:19:55.897]  Head on over to InfoWarsLife.com and say goodbye to fatigue.
[00:19:56.118 --> 00:19:57.478]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[00:20:02.262 --> 00:20:04.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.477 --> 00:20:24.945]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:34.173 --> 00:20:37.335]  As you can see in this video, this intern came up to me.
[00:20:37.355 --> 00:20:38.916]  They're describing her as an intern.
[00:20:38.936 --> 00:20:43.118]  I don't really know who she is, and attempted to take the microphone away from me.
[00:20:43.718 --> 00:20:48.561]  All I can say at that point is that I was trying to hang on to the microphone so I could continue to ask the president questions.
[00:20:49.642 --> 00:20:50.322]  Obviously, I didn't...
[00:20:51.943 --> 00:20:52.524]  That's enough.
[00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:53.084]  That's enough.
[00:20:53.104 --> 00:20:54.165]  That's enough.
[00:20:54.185 --> 00:20:54.765]  That's enough.
[00:20:54.785 --> 00:20:55.165]  That's enough.
[00:20:55.185 --> 00:20:55.546]  That's enough.
[00:21:21.764 --> 00:21:23.545]  I think that's under- You're a very rude person.
[00:21:23.585 --> 00:21:25.725]  The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible.
[00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:28.206]  And the way you treat other people are horrible.
[00:21:28.647 --> 00:21:30.227]  You shouldn't treat people that way.
[00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:32.908]  Go ahead.
[00:21:32.968 --> 00:21:34.649]  Now, there's so many facets to this.
[00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.669]  Do you remember on September 11, 2016?
[00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:46.565]  A month and a half out from the 2016 election, Hillary fell down in front of her black ambulance that we first broke a month before.
[00:21:46.965 --> 00:21:52.010]  She has a black ambulance, a wheelchair, they have a medical tent, she's having convulsions every 45 minutes.
[00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.032]  We were told this by the Secret Service.
[00:21:54.052 --> 00:21:59.096]  In fact, it was so secret that the RNC, they said, we've got a message for you, you'll get it in the next few weeks.
[00:21:59.376 --> 00:21:59.977]  It was months.
[00:22:00.417 --> 00:22:01.618]  They delivered it in person.
[00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:04.181]  They said, you've got crew all over the country, right?
[00:22:04.441 --> 00:22:05.202]  Follow the ambulance.
[00:22:05.222 --> 00:22:06.302]  It's a black van.
[00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.991]  We said we don't have credit where he said we'll just try.
[00:22:09.452 --> 00:22:15.937]  Well we ended up getting it in Ohio and somebody else caught it in New York.
[00:22:17.518 --> 00:22:30.467]  CNN, MSNBC would show her stumble as she starts having the seizure but not fall on her face or get picked up and put in and they would say that we were lying and that she only stumbled and they would cut before
[00:22:32.287 --> 00:22:32.948]  She fell down.
[00:22:33.108 --> 00:22:34.209]  They would say, see, she just stumbled.
[00:22:34.449 --> 00:22:35.169]  This is fake news.
[00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.631]  But the internet all saw it, so they knew they were lying.
[00:22:39.112 --> 00:22:40.433]  Try to find that clip, guys.
[00:22:41.314 --> 00:22:45.217]  It was headline like, media claims M4 is lying, that Hillary did not fall down.
[00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:47.119]  Cut clip before she falls down.
[00:22:47.479 --> 00:22:51.322]  That's the level of deception and of criminal activity we're dealing with.
[00:22:51.822 --> 00:22:53.243]  And as a mass, they do it.
[00:22:53.584 --> 00:22:55.926]  So Jim Acosta says, I don't know who this woman is.
[00:22:56.506 --> 00:22:57.687]  He's there every week.
[00:22:57.727 --> 00:22:59.108]  He's there every day at these things.
[00:22:59.448 --> 00:23:00.889]  Everyone knows who the
[00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.512]  Staffers are that go around giving people the microphone.
[00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:09.155]  They sit there and they beg for it, and they look for it, and they reach out for it.
[00:23:09.195 --> 00:23:10.736]  He says, I don't know who this person is.
[00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:15.939]  Like he's walking down some dark alley and someone, you know, comes up and touches him so he karate chops him.
[00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:16.779]  No.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.061]  So everything's a lie with this little Decepticon.
[00:23:19.341 --> 00:23:20.862]  I have no idea who this woman is.
[00:23:21.202 --> 00:23:22.443]  I've just asked three questions.
[00:23:22.703 --> 00:23:23.904]  I'm just running over the president.
[00:23:25.336 --> 00:23:32.701]  You know, eight feet from him, right in front of the podium, pointing my finger at him, and then after he says, sit down, give the mic back, I don't know who came over to get it.
[00:23:34.182 --> 00:23:38.825]  A five-year-old knows that you go to these events, it's the person handing the microphone out, when they ask for it, you give it back.
[00:23:39.806 --> 00:23:41.767]  So he's lying about that, and then he says the Whopper.
[00:23:42.307 --> 00:23:43.608]  I did not even touch her.
[00:23:44.769 --> 00:23:50.753]  And National News went with that and said, Jones edited it to make it look like he touched her with trick video.
[00:23:51.373 --> 00:23:54.756]  People went and looked at it and they said, they zoomed in, they just blew it up.
[00:23:55.353 --> 00:24:01.500]  They went, oh well, still, they sped it up, then they slowed it down, then the clip's the exact same length.
[00:24:03.523 --> 00:24:06.867]  It's unbelievable the mind control they try to engage in.
[00:24:06.947 --> 00:24:08.929]  It's ridiculous, is what it is.
[00:24:12.056 --> 00:24:21.202]  The president came out and responded because they were pressuring the White House to come out and apologize to Acosta and have Sanders apologize for putting out a Paul Joseph Watson Infowars tweet.
[00:24:21.322 --> 00:24:22.403]  How dare you?
[00:24:22.883 --> 00:24:24.084]  How dare you?
[00:24:24.364 --> 00:24:29.427]  So Trump went and looked at it and said, properly, because he's worked in television for decades, no, they blew it up.
[00:24:29.727 --> 00:24:30.548]  They zoomed in.
[00:24:30.868 --> 00:24:32.109]  That's not doctoring.
[00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:35.491]  Doctoring is changing something to make it look like something else.
[00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:38.452]  Zooming in is making it clearer!
[00:24:38.972 --> 00:24:40.673]  Zooming in is transparency!
[00:24:41.013 --> 00:24:42.714]  Zooming in is investigating!
[00:24:43.074 --> 00:24:44.734]  Zooming in is checking!
[00:24:46.035 --> 00:24:52.177]  When you read the newspaper and you look closer at the print, are you doctoring or are you investigating?
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.460]  We were clarifying.
[00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:56.301]  We were making it clearer.
[00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:57.981]  We were zooming in.
[00:24:58.342 --> 00:24:59.942]  We were doing the opposite of lying.
[00:25:00.002 --> 00:25:01.162]  We were revealing.
[00:25:01.362 --> 00:25:02.403]  What does sunshine do?
[00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:03.403]  It reveals.
[00:25:03.943 --> 00:25:04.984]  What does a curtain do?
[00:25:05.024 --> 00:25:07.164]  Like mainstream media, it brings darkness.
[00:25:07.424 --> 00:25:08.545]  You stumble in the dark.
[00:25:08.565 --> 00:25:12.766]  So here's the president defending Paul Watson and Infowars and reality.
[00:25:13.506 --> 00:25:15.467]  The taped video of Costa?
[00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:17.883]  What are you talking about?
[00:25:19.043 --> 00:25:19.664]  All that was?
[00:25:20.164 --> 00:25:21.445]  Nobody manipulated it.
[00:25:21.485 --> 00:25:22.306]  Give me a break.
[00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:24.387]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:26.008]  All that is is a close-up.
[00:25:26.409 --> 00:25:29.311]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:25:29.731 --> 00:25:30.412]  I watched that.
[00:25:30.472 --> 00:25:31.532]  I heard that last night.
[00:25:31.853 --> 00:25:33.093]  They made it close-up.
[00:25:33.133 --> 00:25:34.294]  They showed it close-up.
[00:25:34.675 --> 00:25:36.656]  And he was not nice to that young woman.
[00:25:36.696 --> 00:25:37.637]  I don't hold him for that.
[00:25:38.437 --> 00:25:41.018]  Because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.
[00:25:41.558 --> 00:25:45.059]  But it was, but all that was, when you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy.
[00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:46.519]  Because it wasn't doctors.
[00:25:46.819 --> 00:25:48.260]  They gave a close-up view.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.721]  That's not doctoring.
[00:25:55.062 --> 00:25:56.102]  No, I wish her well.
[00:25:57.302 --> 00:25:57.963]  So there you go.
[00:25:57.983 --> 00:25:59.323]  The video's up on Infowars.com.
[00:25:59.463 --> 00:26:01.424]  I'll probably say that's a fake video we just showed.
[00:26:01.704 --> 00:26:02.584]  It's all they've got.
[00:26:02.624 --> 00:26:03.144]  They're caught.
[00:26:03.824 --> 00:26:04.564]  They're known liars.
[00:26:04.624 --> 00:26:05.205]  No, no, no.
[00:26:05.765 --> 00:26:06.185]  Coming up...
[00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:19.825]  Owen's walking down the street, he's at the Smithsonian talking about Black History Month and how black unemployment is the lowest ever recorded and how Trump loves black people, and some weird leftist black people come over and start pushing him saying, get out of here.
[00:26:21.367 --> 00:26:23.989]  He goes, that's not very nice, and leaves.
[00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:28.713]  They edited it to say, Owen Schroyer attacks innocent black family.
[00:26:29.534 --> 00:26:30.675]  Now you want to see doctoring.
[00:26:32.145 --> 00:26:35.407]  We're going to show you criminal-level doctoring.
[00:26:36.087 --> 00:26:41.809]  The reason it's criminal is they're trying to then use it in a nationwide campaign right now, in newspapers everywhere, to take us off the air.
[00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:47.072]  Watch Jones' attack dog, white supremacist, bully black family.
[00:26:49.605 --> 00:26:51.286]  They mean BIDNESS.
[00:26:51.806 --> 00:26:55.487]  I mean that is, this is just getting crazier and crazier.
[00:26:55.507 --> 00:26:59.468]  It says we dehumanize and harass a black family.
[00:27:00.088 --> 00:27:02.389]  America must act now to stop the evil.
[00:27:02.429 --> 00:27:03.009]  That's coming up.
[00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.031]  Now this next piece you're gonna see is a bit of satire, but it's not.
[00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:13.453]  They said Koren Lewandowski basically brutalized and tried to rip a woman's arm out of her socket like Beowulf did Grendel.
[00:27:14.113 --> 00:27:16.393]  Six frames, barely brushed beside her.
[00:27:17.274 --> 00:27:17.774]  Acosta
[00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:22.829]  Slaps, pushes down her arm hard, pulls away, and she lets go.
[00:27:24.485 --> 00:27:28.567]  That's kind of a little tussle, but I wouldn't say she'd get arrested for it.
[00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:31.248]  Now, under Democrat rules, he murdered her.
[00:27:31.628 --> 00:27:34.910]  He was Godzilla coming out of the water, vaporizing D.C.
[00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:35.830]  Okay?
[00:27:35.891 --> 00:27:49.077]  So, under Democrat rules, you're about to see Millie Weaver, just a few months ago, at one of the Trump events, and she's trying to talk to Acosta, being very polite, and the bodyguard Godzilla attacks and kills her.
[00:27:49.777 --> 00:27:51.898]  Her head's cut off, blood sprays, she dies.
[00:27:52.158 --> 00:27:52.939]  Now, that didn't really happen.
[00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:58.806]  But according to Democrat level, like touching someone, if it's a Republican to a woman, it's devastating assault.
[00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:02.630]  So, compared to Lewandowski, this is death.
[00:28:03.131 --> 00:28:03.671]  Here's the footage.
[00:28:04.953 --> 00:28:09.018]  Sir, are you okay with news being censored?
[00:28:09.038 --> 00:28:11.441]  You're okay with media organizations being censored?
[00:28:11.684 --> 00:28:12.865]  You really have nothing to worry about.
[00:28:12.905 --> 00:28:15.387]  Sir, are you okay with news being censored?
[00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:19.391]  You just saw Billy Weaver killed by Jim Acosta's security.
[00:28:19.451 --> 00:28:20.772]  Murdered!
[00:28:21.012 --> 00:28:23.014]  Now, I'm being sarcastic, that's satire.
[00:28:23.455 --> 00:28:26.697]  I don't think the guy, he was nice at first, she was nice.
[00:28:27.318 --> 00:28:32.843]  She got a little, you know, reporter-y and there was no need to push the thing back because it wasn't in his face.
[00:28:33.283 --> 00:28:34.665]  But okay, I'm not saying it's assault.
[00:28:35.245 --> 00:28:39.166]  But according to Democrats, Jim Acosta murdered Millie Weaver, our reporter.
[00:28:39.346 --> 00:28:40.126]  He murdered her.
[00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:41.867]  And then he ate her body.
[00:28:42.307 --> 00:28:44.087]  He chopped her head off and drank her blood.
[00:28:44.507 --> 00:28:46.608]  And then, yeah, well, of course it's not real.
[00:28:47.028 --> 00:28:48.328]  But see, I'm trying to be like CNN now.
[00:28:48.748 --> 00:28:51.089]  Joe, our reporter was murdered by Jim Acosta's people.
[00:28:52.069 --> 00:28:52.889]  Of course, that's not true.
[00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:53.569]  Let me be clear.
[00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:56.090]  I'm illustrating, if I was like them, what I would be saying.
[00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.830]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:03.846 --> 00:29:12.574]  If the Deep State and Robert Mueller and his allies now in the Democratic House succeed in destroying me, who will be next?
[00:29:13.055 --> 00:29:20.061]  You see, I've been targeted because I stood up for America, because I stood up for our president and his reform agenda.
[00:29:20.482 --> 00:29:23.264]  And now I have no choice but to appeal to you.
[00:29:24.185 --> 00:29:30.928]  I am very grateful to all those Americans who have stepped forward to help me so far in this extraordinary legal struggle.
[00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:33.770]  But now I need your help as never before.
[00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.031]  Please go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:29:37.371 --> 00:29:39.052]  Help me stand up for America.
[00:29:39.252 --> 00:29:42.274]  Because if they get Roger Stone, you may be next.
[00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:50.178]  The real truth can be found at InfoWars.com, StoneColdTruth.com, NewsWars.com.

[00:31:57.688 --> 00:32:03.430]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:07.732]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:10.393]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[00:32:10.413 --> 00:32:12.553]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[00:32:12.894 --> 00:32:14.894]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[00:32:15.414 --> 00:32:15.654]  Boom!
[00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:18.195]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:20.116]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[00:32:20.176 --> 00:32:21.977]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[00:32:22.037 --> 00:32:23.157]  You still have a shopfront.
[00:32:23.357 --> 00:32:24.138]  And then what do we see?
[00:32:24.438 --> 00:32:25.178]  Washington Post.
[00:32:25.738 --> 00:32:28.860]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%!
[00:32:30.241 --> 00:32:33.343]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[00:32:33.363 --> 00:32:36.205]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[00:32:36.505 --> 00:32:41.928]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:42.228 --> 00:32:49.233]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros, like Media Matters is, to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[00:32:49.553 --> 00:32:52.955]  We're not funded by Dolph State dictatorships, like CNN is,
[00:32:53.215 --> 00:32:56.796]  We're only funded by you, by getting the products at infootballstore.com.
[00:33:02.238 --> 00:33:04.898]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:24.113]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:24.993 --> 00:33:26.574]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.941 --> 00:33:48.204]  So, Jim Acosta is the guy that said that he was at the hospital and President Trump did not visit Congressman Scalise.
[00:33:50.089 --> 00:33:58.356]  He also seconded and continued reporting what MSNBC was saying over at CNN that they had removed the bust of Martin Luther King.
[00:33:58.977 --> 00:34:00.078]  That Trump had ordered that done.
[00:34:00.558 --> 00:34:03.641]  This is a man dedicated to complete evil.
[00:34:04.522 --> 00:34:06.884]  And his world is about deceiving you.
[00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:10.547]  And that entire channel at CNN is not media.
[00:34:10.627 --> 00:34:15.792]  It's about destroying free speech, hounding Infowars off of the internet.
[00:34:18.177 --> 00:34:24.383]  So we joke about these people, but we have new footage that I'm going to air coming up after Paul leaves us.
[00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:37.715]  Then I have Owen Schroer later in studio talking about this, because George Soros and Media Matters have a new national campaign to take us off the air, saying that we assaulted, verbally, an innocent black family on the street.
[00:34:38.757 --> 00:34:39.898]  It's the opposite.
[00:34:40.598 --> 00:34:51.866]  They heard Owen doing a report about how black poll numbers were very high for Trump, and how Trump was really trying to help African Americans, and these folks came over and started bumping him and saying, get out of here.
[00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:55.929]  Media Matters edited that off, and it is criminal.
[00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:57.450]  But that's who these people are.
[00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.871]  Dedicated to murdering truth.
[00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:01.272]  Dedicated.
[00:35:02.213 --> 00:35:05.175]  Like Acosta is such a liar in the same piece.
[00:35:06.414 --> 00:35:06.918]  Yesterday.
[00:35:06.958 --> 00:35:08.206]  During the two-and-a-half-minute exchange.
[00:35:08.227 --> 00:35:09.334]  We'll play it later for Paul Leaves.
[00:35:10.529 --> 00:35:13.170]  He says there is no migrant caravan.
[00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.430]  They're hundreds of miles away.
[00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:15.451]  It's not real.
[00:35:15.751 --> 00:35:17.371]  And Trump goes, oh, they're actors.
[00:35:18.772 --> 00:35:20.052]  Everything's a lie!
[00:35:20.532 --> 00:35:21.732]  He's a lie machine.
[00:35:22.113 --> 00:35:23.293]  He says he didn't touch her.
[00:35:23.593 --> 00:35:27.994]  Let's play that piece that we just played earlier before we go to Paul and then the President.
[00:35:28.495 --> 00:35:29.375]  Here is Acosta.
[00:35:29.395 --> 00:35:31.135]  This is for TV viewers mainly, for radio listeners.
[00:35:31.515 --> 00:35:33.236]  He's saying he never even touched her.
[00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:36.417]  And it's him pushing down her arm and then pulling it away.
[00:35:36.437 --> 00:35:39.278]  And you see she lets go because it was pretty forceful.
[00:35:40.233 --> 00:35:43.795]  Now we can let this pass in the moment, because she initiated contact.
[00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:46.996]  But by the time the president said stop it, he better stop it.
[00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:49.897]  We're not like the left saying, if you touch somebody it's assault.
[00:35:50.758 --> 00:35:52.038]  But it started to go into that area.
[00:35:52.098 --> 00:36:01.543]  But then when he said he didn't touch her, in front of the whole world when it's on video, and he says we're lying, and that we doctored it, I've never heard of such lies.
[00:36:01.723 --> 00:36:04.064]  And it just goes to the mindset of these people.
[00:36:04.124 --> 00:36:08.366]  And now the president's responded, defending Paul Watson and Infowars, but here is the compilation.
[00:36:09.026 --> 00:36:19.834]  He and I were going back and forth there, and as you can see in this video, this intern came up to me, they're describing her as an intern, I don't really know who she is, and attempted to take the microphone away from me.
[00:36:19.854 --> 00:36:20.435]  Now stop it there.
[00:36:20.455 --> 00:36:21.456]  All I can say is- Stop it there.
[00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:23.717]  Start it over for TV viewers, for A-listers.
[00:36:24.438 --> 00:36:31.303]  CNN cuts and loops footage, doesn't show the confrontation to say, see nothing happened.
[00:36:31.964 --> 00:36:36.227]  And then Anderson Cooper comes back, and says, wow you saw the video folks, never touched her.
[00:36:37.264 --> 00:36:38.366]  We have that coming up, too.
[00:36:38.427 --> 00:36:39.208]  The unedited clip.
[00:36:39.449 --> 00:36:40.010]  The full clip.
[00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.415]  I mean, the level of the gaslighting.
[00:36:42.836 --> 00:36:44.761]  These people are unbelievable!
[00:36:45.101 --> 00:36:46.565]  What next level will they go to?
[00:36:46.725 --> 00:36:47.146]  Sorry, sorry.
[00:36:47.386 --> 00:36:47.948]  Start the clip over.
[00:36:48.587 --> 00:36:53.511]  And I were going back and forth there and as you can see in this video, this intern came up to me.
[00:36:53.531 --> 00:36:55.053]  They're describing her as an intern.
[00:36:55.073 --> 00:36:59.276]  I don't really know who she is and attempted to take the microphone away from me.
[00:36:59.877 --> 00:37:04.721]  All I can say at that point is that I was trying to hang on to the microphone so I could continue to ask the president questions.
[00:37:05.802 --> 00:37:10.306]  Obviously, I didn't put my hands on her or touch her as they're alleging.
[00:37:10.566 --> 00:37:11.407]  If I may ask one other question.
[00:37:11.427 --> 00:37:11.687]  That's enough.
[00:37:11.707 --> 00:37:13.688]  Mr. President, if I may ask one other question.
[00:37:13.708 --> 00:37:14.189]  Are you worried?
[00:37:14.209 --> 00:37:14.729]  That's enough.
[00:37:14.969 --> 00:37:15.290]  That's enough.
[00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:16.791]  Mr. President, if I may ask one other question.
[00:37:16.811 --> 00:37:18.152]  The other folks at... That's enough.
[00:37:18.412 --> 00:37:19.473]  Pardon me, ma'am.
[00:37:20.574 --> 00:37:25.117]  Obviously, I didn't put my hands on her or touch her, as they're alleging.
[00:37:25.397 --> 00:37:26.899]  The other folks at... That's enough.
[00:37:26.919 --> 00:37:30.641]  I didn't put my hands on her or touch her, as they're alleging.
[00:37:30.902 --> 00:37:32.023]  The other folks at... That's enough.
[00:37:32.443 --> 00:37:36.146]  I didn't put my hands on her or touch her, as they're alleging.
[00:37:36.406 --> 00:37:37.507]  The other folks at... That's enough.
[00:37:38.067 --> 00:37:38.748]  I think that's unbearable.
[00:37:38.768 --> 00:37:39.708]  You're a very rude person.
[00:37:39.728 --> 00:37:41.889]  The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible.
[00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.470]  Alright.
[00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.930]  That's right.
[00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:50.335]  We're going to go back to the President's response just about an hour ago, defending Paul Watson in the video, just saying all we did was zoom it in.
[00:37:50.595 --> 00:37:51.515]  That's not doctoring.
[00:37:51.835 --> 00:37:53.196]  That's showing even more clarity.
[00:37:53.516 --> 00:37:55.498]  That's enhancing for the truth.
[00:37:56.418 --> 00:37:58.920]  Binoculars don't make your eyes lie.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.401]  They give you further vision.
[00:38:01.308 --> 00:38:04.630]  Brushing your teeth isn't attacking your teeth, it's helping them!
[00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.571]  I mean, Paul, this is insane.
[00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:07.692]  What has happened here?
[00:38:07.732 --> 00:38:13.555]  Are they just so used to lying that the lies now have become so ridiculous that this is now blown up in their face?
[00:38:13.756 --> 00:38:16.077]  But all over the place, corporate media is still defending it?
[00:38:17.802 --> 00:38:19.664]  Well, it's blown up in their face, Alex.
[00:38:19.925 --> 00:38:21.287]  Some of them are having to backtrack.
[00:38:21.307 --> 00:38:24.230]  But again, it's such a bubble that they just regurgitate it.
[00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:30.078]  And a lot of these hit pieces are just basically formulaic copies of the initial hit pieces.
[00:38:30.138 --> 00:38:33.102]  So then it goes, you know, it spreads in that manner, like a virus.
[00:38:33.702 --> 00:38:47.410]  But the fact is, Vice News, no fans of Infowars, no fans of me certainly, Vice News talked to two forensic experts, and I don't even need to talk about this because I know I didn't doctor the video, it zoomed in, that's not doctoring.
[00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:55.454]  But even though you've got two forensic experts who said that there's no evidence whatsoever that it was doctored, one of them is called Hanifah Reed,
[00:38:56.303 --> 00:39:01.566]  Who studies digital forensics, human perception and image analysis, University of California, Berkeley.
[00:39:02.146 --> 00:39:04.667]  And he said he does not think the video was doctored.
[00:39:05.007 --> 00:39:15.813]  He agreed the entire video was, of course, slowed down and zoomed in to focus on the moment of physical contact, but does not see any evidence to suggest that it was selectively edited to exaggerate Acosta's motion.
[00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:22.536]  They had another guy from the University of Colorado called Jeff Smith, who is another image analyst,
[00:39:23.402 --> 00:39:24.944]  They said he came to a similar conclusion.
[00:39:25.044 --> 00:39:34.112]  Smith told Motherboard that he could detect duplicate frames in the White House video, which could indicate it was doctored, but then he went on to say that it wasn't.
[00:39:34.232 --> 00:39:36.935]  There are duplicate frames, two additional frames.
[00:39:36.955 --> 00:39:40.057]  Again, that's due to video compression, Alex, as we talked about yesterday.
[00:39:40.758 --> 00:39:46.964]  But he says, otherwise, the video is not slowed down, doesn't appear to be altered on the pixel level, as many people in the Twitterverse are claiming.
[00:39:47.264 --> 00:39:49.206]  So first, Alex, they said it was sped up.
[00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:53.483]  Then they said it was slowed down and now they're having to back away from that completely.
[00:39:53.784 --> 00:39:55.510]  The New York Times, Alex, today.
[00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:57.792]  Because Colbert talked about this.
[00:39:58.273 --> 00:39:59.594]  Jimmy Kimmel talked about it.
[00:39:59.634 --> 00:40:00.995]  They all regurgitated it.
[00:40:01.495 --> 00:40:09.061]  New York Times reports today, quote, the video was sped up, creating the illusion that Acosta had pushed the female intern roughly.
[00:40:09.442 --> 00:40:11.023]  The video was not sped up.
[00:40:11.684 --> 00:40:14.686]  Even the forensic experts at Vice admit to that.
[00:40:15.086 --> 00:40:17.368]  Now they're saying, oh, it might have been slowed down.
[00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:18.809]  Like, make your mind up, seriously.
[00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.611]  This is blown up in their face, Alex.
[00:40:20.671 --> 00:40:21.332]  It's ridiculous.
[00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:25.295]  Paul, how many times have I begged you, though, not to use the free crap video editor you have?
[00:40:27.037 --> 00:40:27.877]  What's that story?
[00:40:28.818 --> 00:40:32.320]  Because it greys the video and it does add skipped frames.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.041]  So sometimes we get videos from you and they're little jumps and stuff.
[00:40:35.642 --> 00:40:37.202]  Obviously everybody sees the video.
[00:40:37.242 --> 00:40:38.663]  They know it's the same length.
[00:40:38.943 --> 00:40:40.324]  It's just a cruddy upload of it.
[00:40:40.764 --> 00:40:41.865]  It's the exact same length.
[00:40:42.885 --> 00:40:47.208]  A few frames that got added by digital distortion doesn't even add a millisecond.
[00:40:47.368 --> 00:40:48.548]  So it's the exact same length.
[00:40:48.628 --> 00:40:49.469]  It is the video.
[00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:53.071]  It just lost resolution because you uploaded to Twitter and zoomed in.
[00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:53.791]  Period!
[00:40:54.091 --> 00:40:54.552]  Period!
[00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:55.272]  Period!
[00:40:56.627 --> 00:40:58.550]  Yeah, and that's what everyone now admits.
[00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:02.074]  But again, this bubble is so intense that they're never going to be able to retract it.
[00:41:02.534 --> 00:41:13.989]  It was a GIF image downloaded from Twitter, exported as an M2T file, then run through another program called Handbrake to make it back into an MP4 file so it could be uploaded to Twitter.
[00:41:14.389 --> 00:41:18.593]  So obviously it's not going to be exactly the same with compression, but it was not edited.
[00:41:18.933 --> 00:41:19.814]  It was not doctored.
[00:41:20.134 --> 00:41:22.697]  They manufactured a complete hoax.
[00:41:22.737 --> 00:41:29.023]  This was an international media hoax to distract from Acosta's behavior, which as Trump said, it wasn't horrible.
[00:41:29.083 --> 00:41:31.505]  It wasn't assault, but it was certainly controversial.
[00:41:31.545 --> 00:41:34.528]  It was a talking point and it reflected negatively on him.
[00:41:34.868 --> 00:41:36.810]  So this is why they had to create an entirely new
[00:41:37.583 --> 00:41:39.004]  Uh, controversy to distract from it.
[00:41:39.244 --> 00:41:45.968]  And now the bigger scandal is Acosta saying he didn't touch her, and the entire corporate media going along with the lie.
[00:41:46.128 --> 00:41:53.753]  Even when they talk to forensic experts, bury the articles, they go, okay, this is just compression, it's real, Acosta pushed her and, you know, pulled the microphone back.
[00:41:54.533 --> 00:41:58.796]  Just the fact that they even tried this, Paul, is just a next-level BS.
[00:42:00.206 --> 00:42:01.867]  I mean, they called it Orwellian.
[00:42:01.907 --> 00:42:06.050]  They claimed that Sarah Sanders or the White House had edited the video and that was Orwellian.
[00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.011]  The Orwellian thing is, like, do you not have eyes?
[00:42:09.151 --> 00:42:15.235]  Can you not see his left arm come down and push her away, physically restrain her, overpower her?
[00:42:16.005 --> 00:42:16.786]  Did he touch her?
[00:42:16.886 --> 00:42:17.807]  Yes, he touched her.
[00:42:17.947 --> 00:42:20.009]  Nobody's saying it's assault, but he touched her.
[00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:21.391]  To claim otherwise is an outright lie.
[00:42:21.411 --> 00:42:30.140]  And like any woman or any man overpowered by somebody else, she looks to the President and the Secret Service like, this dude just shut my arm down and jerked the mic back.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:30.721]  What do I do now?
[00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:33.403]  Yeah, you can see her immediate reaction.
[00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:36.884]  She's surprised by the fact that he's physically restraining her.
[00:42:36.924 --> 00:42:37.925]  She didn't see that coming.
[00:42:38.225 --> 00:42:38.925]  Did he touch her?
[00:42:39.185 --> 00:42:40.325]  Yes, he touched her.
[00:42:40.505 --> 00:42:42.606]  The video, which is not doctored, shows that.
[00:42:42.906 --> 00:42:43.326]  It's proof.
[00:42:43.566 --> 00:42:48.687]  I mean, I'm a man, but if I was doing the mediation and a man pulled a mic back, I wouldn't do it.
[00:42:48.727 --> 00:42:49.467]  I'd call security over.
[00:42:49.487 --> 00:42:50.068]  That's what she does.
[00:42:50.128 --> 00:42:51.308]  He manhandles her.
[00:42:51.348 --> 00:42:52.128]  She looks at security.
[00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:55.289]  Paul, let's come back, though, and play the president's defense of you.
[00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.729]  Stay with us.
[00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:13.413]  Paul, get into this huge situation in Europe because I know that the Islamicists are raping and stealing and killing and then the leftists say because you're not bringing enough Muslims in.
[00:43:13.533 --> 00:43:17.814]  It's like they're trying to flip reality into this bizarro deception land.
[00:43:17.975 --> 00:43:19.915]  So, what would you call this?
[00:43:20.195 --> 00:43:23.997]  Well, it's mass deception and going on to France, which you mentioned.
[00:43:24.737 --> 00:43:27.659]  Literally, there are like 8,000 Jews leaving Paris alone.
[00:43:27.679 --> 00:43:31.102]  I think it's Paris, maybe it's France, but I think it's Paris alone every single year.
[00:43:31.122 --> 00:43:32.583]  8,000 Jews fleeing.
[00:43:33.163 --> 00:43:34.464]  We defend those people.
[00:43:34.504 --> 00:43:39.848]  We say this is horrible that anti-Semitic attacks are increasing in France, in all these European countries.
[00:43:40.208 --> 00:43:43.430]  And then we're called anti-Semites, Alex, in France.
[00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.492]  We've defended Jews being chased out of the country, basically.
[00:43:46.572 --> 00:43:47.993]  Last night, there were more riots.
[00:43:48.033 --> 00:43:49.233]  They called it the Purge.
[00:43:49.353 --> 00:43:54.456]  They based it on this movie, which says, basically, the plot is you can commit any crime for one night.
[00:43:54.496 --> 00:43:55.737]  So they went on a rampage.
[00:43:55.957 --> 00:43:56.918]  Stores were looted.
[00:43:56.938 --> 00:43:58.139]  They had fights with police.
[00:43:58.299 --> 00:44:03.102]  In Paris as well, this happened in Saint-Denis, which is the area where they have... That's in Lyon that you're showing now.
[00:44:03.222 --> 00:44:05.403]  It was on the same night, also, in Saint-Denis, Paris.
[00:44:05.803 --> 00:44:10.670]  Where they have 400,000 illegal immigrants in this one area of Paris alone.
[00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.415]  They were throwing acid at the police, they were robbing grocery stores.
[00:44:14.976 --> 00:44:22.046]  And this came like the day after Francis Denintiri, Minister, he actually gave the interview back in February, but it was just published a few days ago.
[00:44:22.686 --> 00:44:31.912]  This is Gerard Collomb who said basically they've got five years and after five years if they don't sort this out, people aren't going to be living together.
[00:44:31.952 --> 00:44:36.514]  They're going to be going face-to-face and he admits that it's all due to mass immigration.
[00:44:36.894 --> 00:44:37.715]  I went to Paris
[00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:44.935]  About five times over the past 10 years, Alex, you could tell the difference post-2015.
[00:44:45.375 --> 00:44:58.925]  After this new influx of migrants from the Middle East, it was literally, I would go to the hotel and drive past all these little shanty towns, all these tent cities where all the migrants were, thinking, oh, this must be the outer ghetto area of Paris.
[00:44:58.945 --> 00:45:01.768]  And it was like five minutes later, you've arrived at your destination.
[00:45:01.808 --> 00:45:03.349]  It was in the major tourist area.
[00:45:03.789 --> 00:45:04.369]  I think so.
[00:45:20.377 --> 00:45:23.298]  Well let's be clear, people are fleeing literal societal collapse
[00:45:46.207 --> 00:45:47.988]  Real road warrior conditions.
[00:45:48.248 --> 00:45:52.169]  And then they don't want to get away from it to not be part of it.
[00:45:52.209 --> 00:45:57.771]  They want to bring it to you because they're usually the worst and the weakest of the nightmare system.
[00:45:58.011 --> 00:46:11.895]  So we're getting the worst of the worst of the worst chaperoned and captained by the left who believe this is some satanic ritual like defiling a baby or a virgin woman to defecate all over Europe and the U.S.
[00:46:12.175 --> 00:46:14.216]  and instead they're destroying their own wealth.
[00:46:14.356 --> 00:46:14.876]  The left is
[00:46:15.316 --> 00:46:16.536]  It is insane!
[00:46:16.876 --> 00:46:24.518]  Exactly, and then when you actually look at it, which I've done in all these major European countries, the few pocket areas of wealthy white areas, they've correlated it.
[00:46:24.578 --> 00:46:28.179]  That's where the most pro-immigration politicians and elitists live.
[00:46:28.259 --> 00:46:35.061]  So this is all being foisted on predominantly white working class people who live in these areas which are being ghettoized.
[00:46:35.181 --> 00:46:40.082]  And they're also the ones called racist by the elite, even though it's being foisted on them.
[00:46:40.462 --> 00:46:42.384]  The elite don't use public transport.
[00:46:42.424 --> 00:46:44.145]  They don't have to mingle with these people.
[00:46:44.485 --> 00:46:46.087]  They're chauffeured around everywhere.
[00:46:46.407 --> 00:46:53.132]  So again, they not only get the bad consequences of mass immigration, they also get blamed and called racist if they complain about it.
[00:47:01.659 --> 00:47:04.321]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.964 --> 00:47:23.887]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:24.347 --> 00:47:26.729]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:26.849 --> 00:47:28.491]  Again, I want to be absolutely clear.
[00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:30.993]  This is one of the biggest stories, if not the biggest.
[00:47:31.093 --> 00:47:34.515]  It got more attention than the tragic shooting yesterday that killed 12 people.
[00:47:35.316 --> 00:47:38.879]  The PTSD Marine was posting to Instagram when he did it.
[00:47:39.299 --> 00:47:41.981]  Will they ban Instagram off of the internet now like they did Gab?
[00:47:42.902 --> 00:47:43.262]  No, they won't.
[00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:45.351]  But a true tragedy.
[00:47:45.391 --> 00:47:52.995]  We've got all this big world news, we've got total election fraud, live feed with our reporters on the ground at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:47:54.035 --> 00:47:56.356]  And we're going to have Roger Stone from Broward County.
[00:47:56.717 --> 00:48:06.261]  There are trucks blocking the entrance as the Democrats try to bring in more 18-wheelers and trucks full of magic ballots that in some cases are 100% precincts reporting for Democrats.
[00:48:06.621 --> 00:48:12.244]  So they'll lose the Senate seat, they'll lose the House seat, they'll lose some of the other seats that the Republicans just won.
[00:48:12.924 --> 00:48:13.884]  This is incredible.
[00:48:13.964 --> 00:48:16.965]  The live feed is on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:17.025 --> 00:48:17.945]  It's happening right now.
[00:48:17.965 --> 00:48:20.486]  In fact, can we go to InfoWars.com for folks?
[00:48:20.806 --> 00:48:22.727]  I want to pull it up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:48:23.487 --> 00:48:26.788]  One of the links you want to spread is at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:27.868 --> 00:48:28.168]  Okay?
[00:48:28.548 --> 00:48:33.789]  Democrats just got caught trying to steal back Florida and Arizona, plus Trump defends InfoWars and more.
[00:48:34.009 --> 00:48:35.850]  Now let's go back to InfoWars.com.
[00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:39.691]  The new live feed is a whole separate feed.
[00:48:40.811 --> 00:48:46.278]  That I want to show TV viewers right now that's in the main featured area right there.
[00:48:46.699 --> 00:48:47.360]  I'll pull up my phone.
[00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:48.521]  Scroll down.
[00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:50.144]  We're going to do this right now together.
[00:48:50.624 --> 00:48:51.305]  There it is right there.
[00:48:51.365 --> 00:48:53.087]  Look, that's the huge news right there.
[00:48:53.768 --> 00:48:58.495]  Four trucks block entrance to Broward County Elections Office.
[00:49:00.635 --> 00:49:05.378]  As protests gather, we have Roger Stone and our reporters are on the ground now.
[00:49:05.799 --> 00:49:07.780]  That is coming up next hour.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:18.248]  Election official meddling being investigated as Dems just happened to find lost 18-wheelers and large trucks full of ballots.
[00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:19.669]  This is huge news.
[00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:21.150]  Get this out to everybody.
[00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:23.972]  It's been criminally investigated by Homeland Security.
[00:49:26.223 --> 00:49:28.484]  This is all happening right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:28.764 --> 00:49:35.846]  Let's go back to the President, because even though this bowling thing is... I've got a bowling clip of him interviewing the White House spokesperson on this.
[00:49:36.327 --> 00:49:50.752]  Even though this whole thing with Acosta is petty, the lying about it and the whole corporate media joining in to lie, and the President having to shatter this whole illusion, illustrates how these people work as a wall.
[00:49:52.153 --> 00:49:53.194]  The tape video of Costa?
[00:50:05.256 --> 00:50:06.297]  What are you talking about?
[00:50:07.238 --> 00:50:07.858]  All that was?
[00:50:08.359 --> 00:50:09.640]  Nobody manipulated it.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.501]  Give me a break.
[00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.582]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:50:12.863 --> 00:50:14.184]  All that is is a close-up.
[00:50:14.764 --> 00:50:17.507]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:50:17.907 --> 00:50:18.607]  I watched that.
[00:50:18.647 --> 00:50:19.728]  I heard that last night.
[00:50:20.029 --> 00:50:21.270]  They made it close-up.
[00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.471]  They showed it close-up.
[00:50:22.871 --> 00:50:24.833]  And he was not nice to that young woman.
[00:50:24.893 --> 00:50:25.814]  I don't hold him for that.
[00:50:26.614 --> 00:50:29.198]  Because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.
[00:50:29.759 --> 00:50:33.263]  But all that was, when you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy.
[00:50:33.484 --> 00:50:34.725]  Because it wasn't doctored.
[00:50:35.026 --> 00:50:36.447]  They gave a close-up view.
[00:50:36.668 --> 00:50:37.669]  That's not doctoring.
[00:50:44.017 --> 00:50:47.119]  At press conferences, has to say, it's not doctored.
[00:50:47.719 --> 00:50:52.181]  There's another White House statement we're going to release, a video we're going to play here in a moment that Eric Bolling just sent me.
[00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:53.342]  We appreciate him doing that.
[00:50:54.102 --> 00:50:55.863]  Where they responded, just said, look, we were all in there.
[00:50:55.903 --> 00:50:56.343]  We saw it.
[00:50:56.363 --> 00:50:57.064]  The video's real.
[00:50:57.844 --> 00:51:00.305]  It doesn't matter if it's sped up or slowed down or zoomed in.
[00:51:00.585 --> 00:51:01.346]  It's not doctored.
[00:51:01.386 --> 00:51:03.106]  Well, we didn't speed it up.
[00:51:03.567 --> 00:51:04.667]  All we did was blow it up.
[00:51:04.727 --> 00:51:05.928]  Paul, final comments on this.
[00:51:07.734 --> 00:51:11.156]  Final comments, Alex, is that, I mean, there are so many liars out there today.
[00:51:11.216 --> 00:51:12.557]  Listen to this from Yahoo News.
[00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:19.881]  Okay, they quote me talking to BuzzFeed saying, digitally, it's going to look a tiny bit different after processing and zooming in.
[00:51:20.222 --> 00:51:25.925]  Elizabeth Loftus, Professor of Law and Social Psychology at the University of California, Irvine, isn't buying it.
[00:51:26.385 --> 00:51:28.647]  The videos are totally different, she says.
[00:51:29.427 --> 00:51:35.031]  Alex, are these videos that you're playing right now totally different, or do they look almost exactly the same?
[00:51:35.451 --> 00:51:37.232]  Elizabeth Loftus is a liar.
[00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:39.572]  Those videos are exactly the same.
[00:51:39.612 --> 00:51:40.533]  There's no doctoring.
[00:51:40.914 --> 00:51:42.556]  There's no speeding up.
[00:51:42.596 --> 00:51:44.198]  Now they're saying, oh, it was slowed down.
[00:51:44.218 --> 00:51:45.660]  It's like, make your mind up, seriously.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.021]  But so many liars.
[00:51:47.562 --> 00:51:50.445]  The original tweets about this got literally like 60,000 retweets, Alex.
[00:51:53.152 --> 00:51:57.353]  Retractions or the debunking tweets got basically, you know, a couple of thousand here and there.
[00:51:57.633 --> 00:51:59.194]  So again, it's a huge echo chamber.
[00:51:59.554 --> 00:52:01.754]  They've convinced each other that this is doctored.
[00:52:01.794 --> 00:52:09.417]  It's like some grand conspiracy where they've deluded themselves into seeing something that's not even there and then denying what actually is there.
[00:52:09.717 --> 00:52:13.018]  The fact that he put his hands on a woman that happened.
[00:52:13.318 --> 00:52:14.018]  Everybody saw it.
[00:52:14.318 --> 00:52:17.020]  So we're talking about the King's new clothes.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:28.029]  He has no clothes, you're calling it out, but everybody else says no, he's wearing beautiful clothes, and finally a three-year-old walks up and says no, the King's naked, and then everybody gets past the peer pressure and starts admitting it's true.
[00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:30.771]  But this time it's the King telling us that CNN
[00:52:31.992 --> 00:52:32.852]  Has no clothes.
[00:52:33.172 --> 00:52:35.313]  And of course that is President Trump.
[00:52:36.034 --> 00:52:41.876]  Paul, we thought, some people thought, I didn't think, but a lot of people thought that things would slow down after the election.
[00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:42.076]  No.
[00:52:42.396 --> 00:52:44.277]  They're only going into insane high gear.
[00:52:44.397 --> 00:52:52.460]  Antifa activating 900 terror squads in their own words as violence escalates, as doxing escalates.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:58.284]  We've got this new Deputy Attorney General, who's now officially the Attorney General, scaring the hell out of him.
[00:52:58.324 --> 00:52:59.384]  We've got his bio.
[00:52:59.424 --> 00:53:05.428]  He's a super patriot, Christian, literally dialed into what's going on.
[00:53:05.729 --> 00:53:06.929]  I've done deep research now.
[00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:08.310]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.151]  Trump's making his move.
[00:53:11.243 --> 00:53:19.349]  Yeah, and I mean, the problem is, Alex, when there is extremism, when there is violence on the right, we call it out, we disavow, we distance ourselves from it.
[00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:27.795]  That doesn't happen on the left, and that's why this is all escalating, because they don't de-escalate it, they seek to escalate it at every available opportunity.
[00:53:28.095 --> 00:53:29.356]  There's a Vox employee
[00:53:30.256 --> 00:53:47.006]  Matt Iglesias yesterday, who basically applauded Antifa stalking, harassing, terrorizing Tucker Carlson's wife and children as they literally hid in a closet, according to reports, saying that basically they deserved it.
[00:53:47.046 --> 00:53:49.447]  He said, I think the idea behind terrorizing his family
[00:53:50.277 --> 00:53:55.398]  Like it or not, as a strategy is to make them feel some of the fear that the victims of MAGA-inspired violence feel.
[00:53:55.839 --> 00:53:58.679]  So he basically applauded it and said that this was a good method.
[00:53:58.939 --> 00:54:02.340]  He's since deleted all his tweets, backed away from it.
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.301]  But again, this is the attitude on the left.
[00:54:04.361 --> 00:54:10.083]  They don't disavow their violent extremists, which is why this is escalating and getting worse.
[00:54:10.243 --> 00:54:14.944]  And they always lie, and they always double down, and they are getting worse.
[00:54:15.164 --> 00:54:16.504]  This is an insane time to be alive.
[00:54:16.544 --> 00:54:18.025]  Thank you, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:18.045 --> 00:54:18.665]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:54:19.602 --> 00:54:19.862]  Thanks.
[00:54:22.164 --> 00:54:24.005]  These controversies get more and more bizarre.
[00:54:25.145 --> 00:54:26.987]  I'm going to come back and get to this video.
[00:54:27.007 --> 00:54:28.988]  We're going to post it on Infowars.com.
[00:54:29.408 --> 00:54:31.770]  White House further responds to this controversy.
[00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:33.591]  And they said, look, we were there.
[00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:37.033]  The video that Infowars shows is what we saw with our eyeballs.
[00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:39.575]  And everyone else saw it, too.
[00:54:40.215 --> 00:54:43.877]  Zooming in is not doctrine.
[00:54:45.078 --> 00:54:46.639]  But this is the level of 1984.
[00:54:48.442 --> 00:54:51.183]  Where they tell you two plus two does not equal four.
[00:54:51.843 --> 00:54:54.384]  And then we've got our crew already reporting live on the ground.
[00:54:54.564 --> 00:54:58.285]  Roger Stone, there's a feed of Roger Stone and others reporting live at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:58.345 --> 00:54:59.566]  Get that link out to everybody.
[00:54:59.886 --> 00:55:01.166]  That's how these feeds go viral.
[00:55:01.446 --> 00:55:02.687]  It's how we get around the censors.
[00:55:03.567 --> 00:55:05.288]  There's so much other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:55:05.328 --> 00:55:06.968]  I tend to wait to the very end of the hour to even plug.
[00:55:07.329 --> 00:55:08.449]  I get so obsessed with the news.
[00:55:08.509 --> 00:55:17.092]  But if you don't support InfoWars, you're missing out on really, really great products that spread the word like t-shirts and hoodies and
[00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:20.812]  We've now got sweaters with InfoWars on them.
[00:55:21.272 --> 00:55:24.373]  We've got so many great Mulan Labe style designs.
[00:55:24.673 --> 00:55:30.594]  We've got really in-your-face political stuff that'll get you in confrontations, but it'll also help you meet a lot of people.
[00:55:31.014 --> 00:55:40.057]  But we've also got things that are covert InfoWars symbols, that are Mulan Labe things, that only get you the positive feedback if you want to network with people and be on the DL.
[00:55:40.077 --> 00:55:43.958]  So we've got our covert operations clothing, and then we've got our open-out
[00:55:45.277 --> 00:55:48.079]  You know, basically drawing their fire type stuff.
[00:55:48.399 --> 00:55:50.660]  And getting a t-shirt is so vital to what we do.
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:56:04.288]  Going to the political rallies, going to the Trump rallies, wearing them, lets the establishment know that America is awake and is taking action and lets them know that we are the folks that brought Trump to the party, which he knows, but his own minions don't.
[00:56:04.648 --> 00:56:05.448]  This is the relaunch of 1776.
[00:56:07.847 --> 00:56:10.749]  So getting t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com is critical.
[00:56:10.809 --> 00:56:13.631]  And if you'll just get one for yourself, one for your wife, one for your neighbor.
[00:56:14.051 --> 00:56:17.573]  If you'll just do your Christmas shopping early at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:56:17.613 --> 00:56:18.134]  Get it out of the way.
[00:56:18.154 --> 00:56:18.834]  Don't fight the crowds.
[00:56:19.354 --> 00:56:21.556]  Get a Trump Pants 2020 shirt.
[00:56:21.736 --> 00:56:23.297]  Get an InfoWars In Your Face shirt.
[00:56:23.677 --> 00:56:25.018]  Get a Molon Lobby hoodie.
[00:56:25.318 --> 00:56:29.181]  We've got them with gold foil, female cut that are just gorgeous.
[00:56:29.221 --> 00:56:31.202]  My wife looks amazing in one.
[00:56:31.562 --> 00:56:32.703]  I'd have her come in and do a photo shoot.
[00:56:32.743 --> 00:56:33.143]  My goodness.
[00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:34.304]  Start drooling though.
[00:56:34.764 --> 00:56:39.867]  The point is, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:40.147 --> 00:56:52.473]  Yeah, no, my beautiful, gorgeous wife, with her little waist and everything else, but then the femininity and the moulin lave, it's a big turn-on, let's be honest.
[00:56:52.834 --> 00:56:55.655]  And then there's the supplements, ladies and gentlemen, at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:56:57.605 --> 00:56:59.025]  We just ended our biggest sale in history.
[00:56:59.045 --> 00:57:01.606]  They're trying to shut down our payment processing and put us out of business.
[00:57:01.806 --> 00:57:03.046]  So I'm like, everything must go!
[00:57:03.526 --> 00:57:08.567]  And we ran it for about two weeks, and a lot of stuff got close to selling out, so it went back to the regular discounted prices.
[00:57:08.647 --> 00:57:13.288]  Except on six items that we do have enough of in stock.
[00:57:13.668 --> 00:57:16.428]  Survival Shield X3, even better than X2.
[00:57:16.608 --> 00:57:19.069]  All three types of iodine, including the Deep Earth Crystal.
[00:57:19.389 --> 00:57:24.150]  But then the chemist is explaining a little bit of the other two in there for uploading.
[00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:25.930]  Even better, a tiny bit of Vitamin C.
[00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:30.933]  Joe, it's a very, very, very, very powerful, very, very special product.
[00:57:31.053 --> 00:57:34.535]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:34.936 --> 00:57:41.040]  It's already got 100% five stars, so thank you all for your reviews as well.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:47.004]  Silver Bullet, 67% off a bunch of other big specials that are the biggest ever at that level for the item itself.
[00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:59.462]  I do want to remind you that here at InfoWars, we are completely and totally listener and viewer supported.
[00:57:59.963 --> 00:58:06.966]  So I want you to go to the InfoWars.com site right now and see some of the extraordinary specials that we are carrying.
[00:58:07.166 --> 00:58:18.251]  Without your loyal support, without your buying these products, whether they're the great nutraceuticals or our t-shirts or our books or any of our products, we literally cannot continue the fight.
[00:58:18.331 --> 00:58:25.834]  Now, if you are not in the market for one of our great nutraceuticals, and we've got some unbelievable sales, Silver Bullet at 67% off.
[00:58:25.974 --> 00:58:27.014]  This is one of my favorites.
[00:58:27.134 --> 00:58:30.676]  The finest colloidal silver product, I think, in the country.
[00:58:30.736 --> 00:58:45.021]  We use a special electronic process which provides for a smaller microbe and therefore greater absorbability of the colloidal silver, known for centuries as one of the most effective antiviral and antibacterial compounds.
[00:58:45.182 --> 00:58:46.322]  I use it whenever I feel
[00:58:46.542 --> 00:58:51.045]  And of course, you can grab a copy of my new book, Stone's Rules, at a very nice price on TheInfoWars.com.
[00:59:10.719 --> 00:59:13.922]  All of those great products help fund the fight for freedom.
[00:59:14.042 --> 00:59:18.306]  We are completely and totally reliant on you in the fight ahead.
[00:59:18.507 --> 00:59:24.412]  It is not incidental that InfoWars has been at the focal point in the war of censorship.
[00:59:24.832 --> 00:59:30.217]  It is not incidental that we have been banned across all platforms on the same day.
[00:59:30.598 --> 00:59:31.499]  That's racketeering.
[00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:35.082]  That's the real collusion they don't want you to know about.
[00:59:35.222 --> 00:59:37.723]  This is an effort to destroy what Alex Jones has built.
[00:59:37.803 --> 00:59:39.123]  Don't let them get away with it.
[00:59:39.183 --> 00:59:41.184]  Go to the Infowars.com store right now.
[00:59:41.504 --> 00:59:44.025]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll be right back.
[00:59:50.328 --> 00:59:56.230]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.679 --> 01:00:11.384]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.826 --> 01:00:14.695]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:01:02.672 --> 01:01:03.376]  Dark Descent!
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.081]  Well, we've got live feeds.
[01:01:14.141 --> 01:01:19.163]  Four trucks block entrance to Bowerd County elections offices as protesters gather.
[01:01:19.644 --> 01:01:21.304]  Roger's been out there last night.
[01:01:21.364 --> 01:01:23.886]  Today, he's got his operatives out there.
[01:01:23.986 --> 01:01:32.330]  He literally ran the operation for George W. Bush, which he's ashamed of now, but he was brought as a top expert by Baker and Hostetler.
[01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:36.533]  And was able to stop them stealing that election, which they were doing.
[01:01:37.073 --> 01:01:38.974]  In hindsight, we know it came out.
[01:01:39.575 --> 01:01:40.415]  They're doing it again.
[01:01:40.515 --> 01:01:43.738]  Broward County, he thought on Tuesday night that they were going to steal it.
[01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:48.814]  And he was sure of that, but then when they didn't, he thought, this is incredible, they always do.
[01:01:49.195 --> 01:02:01.545]  And then now the governorship, the Senate race, the Ag Commissioner that was all to the Republicans, now magically 18-wheelers have pulled up in other trucks, and the Democrats are delivering precincts that are almost 100% Demo rat.
[01:02:01.786 --> 01:02:03.247]  Wow, big surprise there, huh?
[01:02:03.727 --> 01:02:12.294]  All right, we'll come back from the break with Roger Stone with the latest tomorrow's news today of the Democrats openly trying to steal the election.
[01:02:12.314 --> 01:02:19.780]  But here is Eric Bolling talking to the White House spokesperson about the giant Gemma Costa InfoWars scandal.
[01:02:19.821 --> 01:02:20.121]  Here it is.
[01:02:20.481 --> 01:02:37.989]  I called Alex Jones and specifically asked him for a comment on whether, you know, because this video allegedly originated at InfoWars, so that's what they're saying, and Alex Jones responded, and we're going to show this to our audience, and Hogan, I'll show you right now, and this is what he had to say.
[01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:42.492]  Well, CNN's Acosta got caught shoving and pushing a woman.
[01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:47.936]  The media says Trump's even bad if he tells a female reporter to stop interrupting him, but that's some tough assault.
[01:02:48.337 --> 01:02:48.997]  So what are they going to do?
[01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:49.678]  They're going to spin it.
[01:02:49.698 --> 01:02:52.240]  They're going to say that we doctored the video at InfoWars.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:53.921]  No, we didn't, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:54.201 --> 01:02:59.825]  All we did was zoom in on the video so you could see that he's hitting her arm.
[01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:03.730]  The very same video was put out by the press secretary.
[01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:05.372]  We have doctored nothing.
[01:03:05.572 --> 01:03:06.773]  They're changing the subject.
[01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:08.676]  Jim Acosta made a fool of himself.
[01:03:08.956 --> 01:03:10.178]  He took over yet again.
[01:03:10.198 --> 01:03:11.860]  That's all he does is grandstand.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:17.566]  Now he's had his credentials revoked, and so they're changing the subject, saying that InfoWars, oh look, they're fake news.
[01:03:17.807 --> 01:03:18.708]  They doctored the video.
[01:03:19.148 --> 01:03:21.310]  Zooming in on video is not doctoring it.
[01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.554]  Anybody can get their original video and zoom in themselves.
[01:03:24.814 --> 01:03:26.656]  We zoomed in so you could see it.
[01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:31.121]  That's the real news we're covering at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:32.682]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:03:33.323 --> 01:03:35.846]  So, there you have it, Unique Alicia.
[01:03:37.631 --> 01:03:46.183]  Response from InfoWars, and that's Alex Jones who runs InfoWars, saying they didn't dock the video, they just focused in on what you had pointed out, that there was actual contact.
[01:03:46.283 --> 01:03:52.150]  Sure, and again, I can't speak to the origin of the video except to say, I know where it started.
[01:03:52.551 --> 01:03:54.332]  We're right in that room over there where everyone saw it.
[01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:56.812]  It doesn't matter who puts it up, who posts it.
[01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:59.133]  It doesn't matter the speed at which the video is seen.
[01:03:59.413 --> 01:04:00.374]  It doesn't matter the angle.
[01:04:00.654 --> 01:04:07.636]  The question is, at the core of this, and this is why Jim Acosta lost his credential, did he touch her or not?
[01:04:07.796 --> 01:04:08.856]  The video is clear he did.
[01:04:09.077 --> 01:04:09.317]  He did.
[01:04:09.537 --> 01:04:11.097]  Who made the decision to pull his credentials?
[01:04:11.377 --> 01:04:12.398]  It was an internal decision.
[01:04:13.178 --> 01:04:14.618]  The President?
[01:04:14.658 --> 01:04:16.019]  Was it internally in the Oval?
[01:04:16.279 --> 01:04:18.440]  No, we talked about it as a team and that was the decision made.
[01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:28.440]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:37.165]  We're going to go to break and come back with Roger Stone with the latest Democrat raping of America.
[01:04:37.185 --> 01:04:42.987]  We've seen the fraud with the three of the five women now admitting that they never even met Kavanaugh.
[01:04:43.007 --> 01:04:43.628]  He never touched him.
[01:04:43.648 --> 01:04:44.948]  But he deserves it.
[01:04:44.988 --> 01:04:45.729]  He's a bad person.
[01:04:47.009 --> 01:04:47.730]  So he made it all up.
[01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:49.630]  And now they're trying to steal Arizona.
[01:04:51.078 --> 01:04:57.285]  Florida with magic trucks that show up days later after the elections closed that they found under a toadstool.
[01:04:59.155 --> 01:05:01.697]  You need to support independent media that's under attack.
[01:05:01.737 --> 01:05:05.159]  We're under attack by these globalists, as you know, and your support's been amazing.
[01:05:05.199 --> 01:05:07.581]  We make it easy to support us because we have great products.
[01:05:07.601 --> 01:05:18.509]  And we're announcing a mega blowout sale at Infowarsstore.com to fund us into the new year so we have a budget to continue on in the face of their attacks.
[01:05:18.969 --> 01:05:20.971]  Super male and super female vitality.
[01:05:21.631 --> 01:05:26.695]  It's incredibly high quality cold-pressed herbs known for strength, stamina, libido, energy.
[01:05:26.955 --> 01:05:27.435]  It's amazing.
[01:05:27.675 --> 01:05:31.558]  It is a whopping 57% off.
[01:05:31.798 --> 01:05:33.960]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, super high quality.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.001]  The best out there.
[01:05:35.061 --> 01:05:36.021]  Never gone this low.
[01:05:36.942 --> 01:05:39.444]  67% off to blow it all out.
[01:05:39.884 --> 01:05:43.246]  Brain Force Plus, now available, 50% off.
[01:05:43.326 --> 01:05:46.267]  Survival Shield X3, the best iodine out there.
[01:05:46.467 --> 01:05:49.208]  Brand new product, 50% off and free shipping.
[01:05:49.409 --> 01:05:58.713]  And we're continuing free shipping store-wide on Alexa, Pure Breeze, water filters, and on all the other books and videos and materiel at the info or store.
[01:06:17.503 --> 01:06:21.007]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:21.587 --> 01:06:23.409]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:38.204]  Well, I can't believe that the top news story yesterday was Alex Jones and Infowars doctor fake Acosta video of him assaulting a woman.
[01:06:40.327 --> 01:06:41.328]  Just total lies.
[01:06:41.948 --> 01:06:43.029]  We never said it was assault.
[01:06:43.509 --> 01:06:46.632]  We said he chopped down on her hand, pushed her away, pulled the microphone away.
[01:06:46.652 --> 01:06:47.672]  He says he never even touched her.
[01:06:48.013 --> 01:06:49.254]  The video, he says, is fake.
[01:06:50.915 --> 01:06:52.296]  I can't believe that's the top story.
[01:06:52.436 --> 01:06:56.039]  I can't believe he did it in front of the whole world, on a dozen live feeds.
[01:06:56.899 --> 01:06:59.201]  The president says, no, Infowars didn't doctor it.
[01:06:59.241 --> 01:07:00.722]  They zoomed in, as you can see it clearer.
[01:07:01.322 --> 01:07:03.704]  It's the exact same length, the exact same everything.
[01:07:03.784 --> 01:07:06.906]  Nothing's been edited, other than zooming it in and uploading it to Twitter.
[01:07:08.087 --> 01:07:08.708]  But they've got
[01:07:10.279 --> 01:07:20.942]  Every psychology professor that doesn't even know how to set their digital watch, much less edit video, in the news saying, no, this is psychological warfare.
[01:07:21.042 --> 01:07:23.403]  Jim Acosta wasn't even there, basically.
[01:07:23.823 --> 01:07:26.064]  He was on another planet when all this happened.
[01:07:26.544 --> 01:07:29.305]  This signifies the next level of their insanity.
[01:07:30.336 --> 01:07:35.220]  You've also seen Antifa go and dox all the Fox News people.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.560]  Now the list has expanded.
[01:07:36.601 --> 01:07:38.422]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:39.843]  And now they're calling for violence.
[01:07:39.983 --> 01:07:43.786]  They're lazing the targets so that other crazies can go attack the houses.
[01:07:44.386 --> 01:07:46.287]  I can tell you the Carlsons have had to move out of their house.
[01:07:47.488 --> 01:07:53.733]  Roger Stone is close friends with Tucker Carlson and Tucker visited us a few times years ago.
[01:07:55.017 --> 01:07:55.157]  I don't
[01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:17.319]  Alexandra Cortez was going to be really entertaining.
[01:08:18.019 --> 01:08:19.820]  She started off with some big whoppers.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:21.880]  That's coming up, bottom of the hour.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:33.204]  Yeah, she says it's not fair she's not paid enough to be in Congress and hasn't gotten her check yet when she's been photographed in all these designer clothes that cost each outfit three to six thousand dollars.
[01:08:33.724 --> 01:08:37.025]  She wears one thousand, two thousand, and three thousand dollar shoes.
[01:08:37.745 --> 01:08:39.586]  They have rained cash down on her.
[01:08:40.686 --> 01:08:45.629]  And now though, she's bitching that for two months, she doesn't have money for an apartment.
[01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:49.991]  This is all just to get her constituents thinking, oh yes, we're all about to get free stuff.
[01:08:50.391 --> 01:08:53.013]  What a sickening joke.
[01:08:53.053 --> 01:08:55.254]  She comes from a rich family, just like Beto.
[01:08:55.674 --> 01:09:01.237]  Giant silver spoon crammed down her throat, and she's just bitching at everybody.
[01:09:01.297 --> 01:09:02.498]  It's unbelievable.
[01:09:02.518 --> 01:09:08.541]  And we have the bizarreness of, again, Trump having defended InfoWars and saying, zooming in is not doctoring.
[01:09:08.581 --> 01:09:10.062]  If anything, it's showing clarity.
[01:09:12.301 --> 01:09:12.981]  It's unbelievable.
[01:09:13.502 --> 01:09:14.922]  So, we're going to get into that.
[01:09:14.962 --> 01:09:17.703]  We're going to get into everything here.
[01:09:17.784 --> 01:09:18.844]  It is just insane.
[01:09:21.425 --> 01:09:24.266]  But I've got Roger Stone riding shotgun with us for much of the hour.
[01:09:24.907 --> 01:09:28.308]  He is the expert on Democrat election fraud.
[01:09:28.328 --> 01:09:29.769]  I mean, you could say he's the expert.
[01:09:30.129 --> 01:09:33.531]  And he's THE expert on Broward County in Florida.
[01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:40.294]  He's THE guy for Baker and Hostetler that the Bushes brought in to
[01:09:41.869 --> 01:09:43.370]  Stop Al Gore from stealing the election.
[01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:47.592]  Again, he doesn't like George W. I don't like George W. He woke up after that, wrote books exposing him.
[01:09:48.052 --> 01:09:50.234]  But back then, he was the head guy on the ground.
[01:09:51.034 --> 01:09:52.495]  He was the head general on the ground.
[01:09:52.775 --> 01:09:56.177]  James Baker was back floating around in Houston and D.C.
[01:09:56.857 --> 01:09:57.217]  running it.
[01:09:57.277 --> 01:10:00.079]  But the main field general was Roger Stone.
[01:10:00.099 --> 01:10:01.780]  So he lives there for decades.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:05.202]  His son's in the police force.
[01:10:06.082 --> 01:10:08.403]  The Sheriff's Department, he knows all the inside baseball.
[01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.065]  And he said, Tuesday night, he said, I believe they're going to steal it.
[01:10:11.325 --> 01:10:12.606]  The way they're not announcing at the end.
[01:10:12.906 --> 01:10:15.267]  Then he said, well, I think they thought they were going to get caught, so they didn't do it.
[01:10:16.648 --> 01:10:18.368]  But he goes, I think they may still pull something.
[01:10:18.449 --> 01:10:19.749]  And just as he said, it's happened.
[01:10:19.769 --> 01:10:20.590]  He's been there last night.
[01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:21.550]  They're today.
[01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:23.451]  We've got live feeds at Infowars.com.
[01:10:24.171 --> 01:10:25.072]  The truck's coming in.
[01:10:25.132 --> 01:10:27.573]  Protesters trying to block the magic trucks.
[01:10:27.873 --> 01:10:28.874]  Heard of magic carpets?
[01:10:28.894 --> 01:10:29.854]  These are magic trucks.
[01:10:30.555 --> 01:10:34.477]  Donald Trump says authorities are investigating possible election fraud in Florida.
[01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:37.090]  It's all up for grabs now.
[01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.131]  The same thing is happening in Arizona.
[01:10:39.572 --> 01:10:45.055]  I tell you, Roger, they were smart to concede, but then really not technically concede.
[01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:46.196]  So we all moved along.
[01:10:46.216 --> 01:10:48.818]  I mean, these folks are deceptive, man.
[01:10:49.458 --> 01:10:51.139]  And they're getting more wily about it, aren't they?
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:56.283]  Well, Alex, it's really an extraordinary situation.
[01:10:56.483 --> 01:11:02.707]  We had a meeting last night of attorneys and activists and others with extensive experience in
[01:11:03.191 --> 01:11:05.752]  Vote counts both here in Florida and elsewhere.
[01:11:06.752 --> 01:11:15.474]  I watched Don Lemon pummel some poor woman online when she tried to make the case that there's a history of voter fraud in this county.
[01:11:15.514 --> 01:11:24.637]  But let me point out that in the Democratic primary for Congress two years ago between Deborah Wasserman Schultz and progressive
[01:11:25.237 --> 01:11:33.907]  Tim Canova, a Bernie Sanders supporter, a lawsuit proved that the Board of Elections had hidden and destroyed ballots.
[01:11:34.368 --> 01:11:45.741]  They won that lawsuit, and then before the court-ordered recount could take place, the Broward County Board of Elections, under the direction of Brenda Snipes, destroyed all of the evidence.
[01:11:46.784 --> 01:12:00.008]  So we have a New York Post story yesterday reporting that a box of provisional ballots was mysteriously found by a school teacher and turned over to the Broward County Board of Elections.
[01:12:00.668 --> 01:12:11.571]  In the recent Republican primary for Congress within Broward County, the Broward County Board of Elections refuses to give the candidates or the parties
[01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:19.559]  A breakdown of the early vote, a breakdown of the absentee vote, a breakdown of the election day vote.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.865]  In some precincts, more Republicans voted than are registered, Alex.
[01:12:25.326 --> 01:12:29.370]  So this is a county with a history of corruption.
[01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:32.053]  You mean more Democrats voted than were registered?
[01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:35.572]  No, I mean in the recent Republican primary.
[01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:41.679]  So there's just more and more historical evidence of corruption in this county.
[01:12:41.999 --> 01:12:49.328]  And therefore, those who are saying, oh, the Republicans speak of voter fraud with no history or evidence, there's a long and
[01:12:49.648 --> 01:12:50.309]  Rich History!
[01:13:10.422 --> 01:13:14.226]  And over and over again in Broward County, they magically trucks are found.
[01:13:14.266 --> 01:13:20.831]  They're always trying trucks in Democrat Party hands that are almost all magically votes for the Democrats.
[01:13:20.872 --> 01:13:31.341]  I mean, and then a phalanx of a train of trucks then all show up and are driving in to deliver a Senate seat, a governor's seat, and some other seats to the Democrats.
[01:13:31.361 --> 01:13:33.463]  This is unbelievably ridiculous.
[01:13:34.875 --> 01:13:46.520]  Well, and last night I publicly urged Governor Rick Scott to order the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, that's our state police, to impound the ballots immediately.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.681]  To take control of the ballots immediately.
[01:13:50.321 --> 01:13:52.682]  It has been reported that he has done so.
[01:13:52.842 --> 01:13:54.503]  I hope that report is correct.
[01:13:55.083 --> 01:14:02.666]  Now, in all honesty, my next piece of advice for the governor would be to replace Brenda Snipes,
[01:14:03.698 --> 01:14:21.157]  Chairman or the Director of the County Board of Elections, which he has the authority to do and could do so on the basis of the irregularities in the recent Republican Congressional primary and the Democratic Congressional primary in which Tim Canova was cheated two years ago.
[01:14:21.497 --> 01:14:25.522]  Now, were he to do that, I would recommend that he appoint
[01:14:26.122 --> 01:14:34.707]  An African-American Democrat to conduct this recount, but someone with an impeccable reputation for integrity and honesty.
[01:14:35.128 --> 01:14:43.353]  There are several fine possibilities on the bench right here in Broward County, or the former chairman of the State Bar Association.
[01:14:43.893 --> 01:14:53.459]  Democrats, African-Americans, but people of impeccable integrity and honesty who will get Austin on his count, be that which it may.
[01:14:54.342 --> 01:15:12.666]  That would be the shrewdest course of action, because of course if Scott removes Brenda Snipes with her long record of incompetence and corruption, he'll be accused of racism unless he replaces her with someone who's also an African American.
[01:15:12.686 --> 01:15:20.088]  But I mean, I don't think people will buy it either way, because Broward County is probably the most famous county other than the county that Chicago's in.
[01:15:21.048 --> 01:15:35.804]  from from stealing elections I mean as you said it's like if there's a guy on the street convicted three times of arson and then somebody's house mysteriously burns down next door to him you know the guy you go talk to is the guy who's got a long history of it and then you've got the trucks like
[01:15:36.484 --> 01:15:39.807]  Appearing out of some leprechaun's pot of gold for the Democrats.
[01:15:40.207 --> 01:15:41.849]  This is ridiculous!
[01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:44.311]  These people are unbelievable!
[01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:46.793]  But bottom line, they're stealing it again.
[01:15:47.213 --> 01:15:48.534]  People are sick of this crap.
[01:15:48.754 --> 01:15:49.795]  They need to take action.
[01:15:50.075 --> 01:15:54.259]  And again, the man quarterbacking, advising the governor, joins us right now.
[01:15:54.279 --> 01:15:55.580]  He doesn't want to brag, but that's what's happening.
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:56.340]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:56.821]  Stay with us.
[01:16:02.345 --> 01:16:04.607]  An energized quantum state.
[01:16:05.987 --> 01:16:08.430]  Or an energized atomic state.
[01:16:09.271 --> 01:16:09.911]  What does that mean?
[01:16:11.013 --> 01:16:12.314]  It means it's pure.
[01:16:13.315 --> 01:16:20.463]  And it means the properties of what it does in the body in interaction with other properties is pure.
[01:16:21.304 --> 01:16:22.846]  Is unadulterated.
[01:16:22.926 --> 01:16:23.526]  Is original.
[01:16:23.767 --> 01:16:24.908]  Is first generation.
[01:16:26.483 --> 01:16:37.591]  This has been quite a quest for Info Wars when we discovered that there's a whole UN world government plan to remove even crappy forms of iodine out of food so that people can't absorb it.
[01:16:37.611 --> 01:16:43.334]  When I say crappy forms, I mean types that are bound to other elements so your body doesn't get absorption.
[01:16:44.115 --> 01:16:49.819]  This is an essential element in the body, just like vitamin C, just like oxygen, just like water.
[01:16:50.982 --> 01:17:04.591]  At first, doing research, we got the best seaweed base, but it was still weak, and we had issues with supply, and then leftists found out six years ago that we were involved, that it was Infowars, so they cut us off.
[01:17:05.331 --> 01:17:13.416]  And then we came into X2 that was from oil and gas drilling at about 7,000 to 12,000 feet, getting pure crystals for truly pure iodine.
[01:17:13.456 --> 01:17:16.258]  We had to go to the DEA to get it, and all these controls.
[01:17:17.472 --> 01:17:21.875]  The oil companies caught on that we were getting it, and they tried to jack up prices and cause us problems.
[01:17:21.915 --> 01:17:25.158]  And I didn't want to raise prices, so I cut my contract off with them.
[01:17:26.301 --> 01:17:33.889]  And we went out and did a huge industry research and found out we could get the same deep-earth crystals, probably even purer.
[01:17:33.969 --> 01:17:36.331]  You're talking about like 9, 9, 9, 9, 9 percent purer.
[01:17:37.672 --> 01:17:44.859]  And then the chemists and others explained to us that you need other types of basic iodine to make sure it gets fully absorbed.
[01:17:44.899 --> 01:17:47.362]  So this has all three types of iodine.
[01:17:48.556 --> 01:17:58.067]  And then it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that doesn't let it oxidize and basically keeps it in its energetic state, or its quantum state, its atomic state.
[01:17:58.287 --> 01:18:03.493]  And again, atomic doesn't mean radioactive, that just means it's pure on the periodic table.
[01:18:04.915 --> 01:18:05.776]  This is X3.
[01:18:06.317 --> 01:18:07.618]  I am so excited about X3.
[01:18:09.619 --> 01:18:15.041]  So that out of the gauge we're bringing it to you at 50% off in the 1 ounce and the 2 ounce bottles.
[01:18:15.621 --> 01:18:17.161]  Now we didn't have X2 in a 2 ounce bottle.
[01:18:17.181 --> 01:18:19.722]  We do for X3 so you can stock up on it.
[01:18:21.283 --> 01:18:24.424]  It really is beyond game changing.
[01:18:24.524 --> 01:18:26.284]  It's essential.
[01:18:27.344 --> 01:18:33.526]  Survival Shield X3, nascent tri-iodine in 2 ounce and in 1 ounce bottles.
[01:18:34.607 --> 01:18:38.708]  And you don't just get a key element that's essential to human life on this planet.
[01:18:39.994 --> 01:18:44.539]  You also funded operations promoting the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the whole nine yards.
[01:18:44.839 --> 01:18:57.832]  I mean, quite frankly, I've got all these scientific documents and all these notes from chemists and all these facts, but I'm just going to tell the viewers, just like our information has changed the world, just like it pisses the establishment off, anything I'm going to break you is the very best.
[01:18:58.633 --> 01:18:59.654]  It's like any of our products.
[01:18:59.774 --> 01:19:01.435]  I'm like, what is the top product?
[01:19:01.495 --> 01:19:02.476]  What is the best tested?
[01:19:02.796 --> 01:19:04.077]  What is absolutely highest rated?
[01:19:04.617 --> 01:19:08.720]  I want to put a formula out stronger and better and lower the price.
[01:19:09.381 --> 01:19:10.461]  We're always innovating.
[01:19:10.501 --> 01:19:11.502]  We're always researching.
[01:19:12.163 --> 01:19:22.470]  But quite frankly, it's been oppression and it's the people trying to block our supply chain that made us go out and really do the hard work to discover what is the very best documented form of iodine.
[01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:29.754]  And it's all three types fused together, energized by a small amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it.
[01:19:29.814 --> 01:19:33.195]  Three forms of iodine is better than one.
[01:19:34.116 --> 01:19:36.317]  And so, that's why X3 is so amazing.
[01:19:36.837 --> 01:19:44.021]  That's why all the results we've got and the trials we have with the crew and others are so breathtakingly cool.
[01:19:44.101 --> 01:19:50.144]  If you like X2, you're gonna love X3 and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:51.085]  The next level.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.802]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:34.244 --> 01:20:39.307]  We can trust Sheriff Israel, who stood down.
[01:20:39.928 --> 01:20:42.589]  We can trust Debbie Washerman Schultz.
[01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:45.511]  We can trust Congressman Deutch.
[01:20:46.672 --> 01:20:52.996]  We can trust all of these people who have incredible histories of cover-ups, stand-downs, corruption.
[01:20:54.815 --> 01:20:56.236]  Might as well trust Alistair Crowley.
[01:20:56.596 --> 01:21:12.763]  Might as well trust Beelzebub, Baphomet, the Old Serpent, and of course you've got the head of the election board, who again, is the most famous person in the United States, living for stealing elections.
[01:21:13.443 --> 01:21:15.884]  And magically, the cavalry has arrived.
[01:21:16.344 --> 01:21:16.665]  What is it?
[01:21:16.765 --> 01:21:19.446]  Five big panel trucks.
[01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:21.147]  They say more is coming.
[01:21:21.707 --> 01:21:22.667]  Whatever amount they need.
[01:21:22.707 --> 01:21:24.108]  They just blow the bugle.
[01:21:25.006 --> 01:21:28.407]  And here comes the cavalry over the hill, Roger Stone.
[01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:31.148]  What else should the governor do?
[01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:32.369]  What do you expect to happen?
[01:21:32.409 --> 01:21:33.729]  How insane is this going to get?
[01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:38.651]  Well, there's a lot of things that are perplexing here, Alex.
[01:21:39.431 --> 01:21:44.073]  The liberals and the left are mobilizing large numbers of protesters.
[01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:48.274]  The White House is actively urging people not to protest.
[01:21:48.614 --> 01:21:50.895]  I think personally that that is an error.
[01:21:51.696 --> 01:21:55.239]  I was at a meeting of about 120 people this morning.
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:02.627]  There are many, many activists from across the state headed to Broward County for peaceful protests this weekend.
[01:22:03.708 --> 01:22:10.295]  I'm obviously getting many text messages and emails advocating another Brooks Brothers riot.
[01:22:11.136 --> 01:22:30.472]  The Brooks Brothers riot was specifically caused by the fact that Democratic commissioners were seeking to remove ballots from a public space and take them to a place where there were no observers from either party or the media, a violation of Florida state sunshine law.
[01:22:30.832 --> 01:22:32.594]  We have not yet seen that.
[01:22:33.614 --> 01:22:42.560]  It's not, I am not the point person for the governor, but I am most certainly doing my party duty because I have extensive experience.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:51.026]  No, I know, but I've talked to you some and others, but you guys are the brains on the ground of the faithful patriots and you guys are putting out reports and advising people.
[01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:59.132]  Well, and we have to, because there seems to be, the state Republican Party seems to be frozen in its response.
[01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:12.137]  And I have extensive recount experience, both in New Jersey in the 1981 governor's race, at which Tom Kane won by 1,200 votes out of 2 million, and of course in the Florida recount of 2,000.
[01:23:13.737 --> 01:23:18.519]  The great misnomer that the Brooks Brothers riot was an attempt to stop the count.
[01:23:18.579 --> 01:23:30.783]  No, we were trying to stop the same group of ballots from being recounted for the third time in a futile effort to find and invent additional votes for Al Gore.
[01:23:35.405 --> 01:23:36.645]  They were really smart this time.
[01:23:36.665 --> 01:23:41.687]  You were sure Tuesday that they were going to come in with the extra ballots and find some, but it just looks like
[01:23:42.594 --> 01:23:45.657]  They hadn't stuffed enough or they hadn't got them prepared yet?
[01:23:45.717 --> 01:23:48.359]  Or why did they wait a few days hoping we weren't looking?
[01:23:48.379 --> 01:23:49.219]  I mean, what was the plan?
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:58.707]  Well, let's not lose sight of the fact that based on her long track record, Brenda Snipes is not only corrupt, she's also incompetent.
[01:23:59.227 --> 01:24:01.289]  Not very good at what she does.
[01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:11.057]  That is why the cover-up in the recent congressional primary is significant because both after it was proven in court
[01:24:11.727 --> 01:24:18.610]  That Snipes had cheated progressive Tim Canova in the congressional race against Wasserman Schultz two years ago.
[01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:21.552]  There were calls for the governor to remove her.
[01:24:22.012 --> 01:24:23.012]  He did not do so.
[01:24:23.673 --> 01:24:37.059]  After this recent fiasco in the Republican congressional primary, which makes no sense at all because the candidate waged essentially no campaign won the primary against two better organized and better funded candidates.
[01:24:37.499 --> 01:24:39.760]  And we can't even get a breakdown of early vote,
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.241]  Absentee vote.
[01:24:41.722 --> 01:24:42.663]  Election day vote.
[01:24:42.783 --> 01:24:44.565]  All they'll do is give you a grand total.
[01:24:45.185 --> 01:24:55.816]  And believe it or not, Alex, when the candidates ask for what is under law, they're publicly entitled to, the Broward County Board of Elections says, well, if you want that, you're going to have to sue us.
[01:24:56.577 --> 01:24:59.220]  And indeed, a lawsuit was filed this morning.
[01:24:59.930 --> 01:25:09.638]  This is important subtext for people like Don Lemon who think that the claims of voter corruption are being somehow invented.
[01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:16.764]  The New York Post story about the finding of a box of provisional ballots is disturbing to me.
[01:25:17.285 --> 01:25:18.986]  I don't know how many ballots that is.
[01:25:19.066 --> 01:25:21.508]  Is it 10,000 ballots?
[01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:23.850]  Is it 23,000 ballots?
[01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:24.691]  Let's recognize.
[01:25:25.332 --> 01:25:27.954]  Broward County is an enormous county.
[01:25:28.846 --> 01:25:33.987]  This is the largest, I think, urban county outside of Miami-Dade.
[01:25:34.607 --> 01:25:38.909]  And therefore, a few precincts is thousands and thousands of votes.
[01:25:39.069 --> 01:25:39.349]  That's right.
[01:25:39.369 --> 01:25:41.989]  We're going to come back and I want to get into other big controversies with you.
[01:25:42.469 --> 01:25:53.152]  What's happening in the House, these other races, strategies for the President, this new incredible Deputy Attorney General that I've done research on who is just a Christian, nationalist, super savvy patriot.
[01:25:53.552 --> 01:25:56.093]  I'm not going to say war because I don't want to give them any cannon fodder, but
[01:25:56.593 --> 01:25:59.675]  I know folks that know him, and this is really the best guy.
[01:26:00.236 --> 01:26:06.140]  Trump's really done his homework with the new acting Attorney General, and hopefully he gets to stay in that position.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:09.463]  We've got two months to act, though, so we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[01:26:09.583 --> 01:26:12.225]  Antifa's issued an expanded hit list and more.
[01:26:13.566 --> 01:26:21.031]  Before I do that, listeners, I want to be able to hire more crew to go 24 hours a day.
[01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:25.535]  Now, with all the enemy attacks and the things they've done and the fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[01:26:26.642 --> 01:26:31.224]  It slowed us down this year, but I intend by the end of the year to launch another three-hour show, seven to ten.
[01:26:32.685 --> 01:26:33.745]  I want to be able to take care of the crew.
[01:26:33.785 --> 01:26:37.107]  They're awesome people, and I want to be able to hire more folks.
[01:26:37.907 --> 01:26:40.788]  We've knocked out 15 of the 20 fake lawsuits.
[01:26:42.249 --> 01:26:43.750]  It never gets covered when I knock one out.
[01:26:45.010 --> 01:26:45.750]  Soros funds them.
[01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:51.113]  But we are winning, and we're moving forward, and we're defeating the globalists.
[01:26:51.732 --> 01:26:57.975]  But we need your hopes, we need your prayers, we need your word of mouth to continue, because you spreading the word, person to person, is unstoppable.
[01:26:58.635 --> 01:26:59.776]  And we need you to buy products.
[01:27:00.636 --> 01:27:11.001]  So many listeners steadfastly love the products, they get the products, but we know that a tiny percent of our amazing listenership and viewership actually goes to mfulworthstore.com.
[01:27:12.862 --> 01:27:16.244]  That is a five star, high security, quality site.
[01:27:17.677 --> 01:27:23.783]  With amazing supplements, amazing Patriot clothing, amazing water filtration, air filtration, it is all the best.
[01:27:23.863 --> 01:27:39.118]  My philosophy is, find the best water filters that I get for the lowest price, find the best air filtration for the lowest price, find the best supplements, already the best brands, either private label them or soup up the best brands and then have it for a lower price.
[01:27:39.478 --> 01:27:39.979]  That's what I do.
[01:27:41.732 --> 01:27:53.656]  And then I get into this system where I discount things all the time, to where now I've got to go to super total discounts, where some things are lost liters, to bring in the big crowd, so that we're able to sell the amount we need to fund the operation.
[01:27:53.676 --> 01:27:57.557]  It's become a catch-22, and I'm not really a... I didn't go to school for marketing or whatever.
[01:27:58.297 --> 01:28:06.120]  I just think, hey, really good prices, sales, sell stuff, but then you go so low, you've got to sell so much to even make a profit, that it becomes a catch-22.
[01:28:08.479 --> 01:28:16.964]  What equalizes that equation to make sure we can be strong and move into the future is that you go get Ultimate Bone Broth if you want stamina, energy, your bones, your ligaments.
[01:28:17.044 --> 01:28:18.125]  It's the best bone broth.
[01:28:18.425 --> 01:28:21.567]  It's way stronger and more concentrated than anything anybody else has got out there.
[01:28:21.587 --> 01:28:25.149]  There's similar forms of it that aren't even as strong for $60 a canister.
[01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:25.990]  Ours is normally $40.
[01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:28.712]  You know, we've had it discounted at $19.95.
[01:28:29.032 --> 01:28:31.753]  Put a few scoops in with your whey, your fruit juice, put it in the blender.
[01:28:32.254 --> 01:28:33.214]  It's unbelievable.
[01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.496]  For meal replacement, you name it.
[01:28:37.547 --> 01:28:40.428]  It's like the He-Man, Cave-Man food, okay?
[01:28:41.408 --> 01:28:44.329]  When I went to the top factory to have it made, they said, no one's ever done anything like this.
[01:28:44.349 --> 01:28:44.869]  This is insane.
[01:28:45.169 --> 01:28:45.930]  That's what we do.
[01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:48.830]  X3, better than X2, the original deep-earth crystals.
[01:28:49.111 --> 01:28:50.851]  We got another source, even deeper, even purer.
[01:28:51.151 --> 01:28:53.632]  But then add a tiny bit of the two others, because it makes it better.
[01:28:54.292 --> 01:28:57.453]  And a tiny bit of vitamin C to then keep it in its activated form.
[01:29:03.106 --> 01:29:05.007]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:05.448 --> 01:29:08.610]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.

[01:29:50.434 --> 01:29:53.716]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:30:02.517 --> 01:30:03.561]  You have the idea for this.
[01:30:04.404 --> 01:30:08.158]  We delivered 100,000 signatures a year and a half ago to
[01:30:11.394 --> 01:30:15.035]  It had a massive, massive effect and got him moving on the censorship.
[01:30:15.636 --> 01:30:25.019]  But you have the idea of, this is a model others have used, it's a handwritten letter, they sign their name, they can print off a copy for free, they mail that, or they don't, we mail it for them.
[01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:27.560]  So either it's two letters go out every time we do it, or one.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.040]  We're gonna send one out regardless.
[01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:34.362]  With the postage paid in an individual letter, one million of these to flood the White House.
[01:30:34.722 --> 01:30:36.442]  I think we're gonna send about $100,000 to Trump Tower in New York.
[01:30:38.203 --> 01:30:40.446]  And it is almost a form of harassment, but we love the president.
[01:30:40.466 --> 01:30:41.227]  We're doing him a favor.
[01:30:41.467 --> 01:30:42.569]  WriteTrump.com.
[01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:46.914]  I'm going to hammer the White House with a million of these, okay?
[01:30:46.954 --> 01:30:47.695]  I'm not playing games.
[01:30:47.955 --> 01:30:49.137]  One million, and I know you'll do it.
[01:30:49.337 --> 01:30:50.378]  We did it last time.
[01:30:50.498 --> 01:30:52.060]  Got 100,000 signatures in a week.
[01:30:52.181 --> 01:30:55.585]  Then we printed them off, and we mailed them, and it showed up, and it was a big fiasco.
[01:30:55.785 --> 01:30:56.585]  I don't like doing this.
[01:30:56.765 --> 01:30:57.385]  I have to do it.
[01:30:57.685 --> 01:30:59.906]  He's going to be knee-deep in these things.
[01:31:00.046 --> 01:31:05.847]  If you take action, write Trump.com, sign your name on the letter to the President that we will mail for you directly to the President.
[01:31:05.907 --> 01:31:17.909]  President Trump must understand the importance of putting a stop to this mass censorship of the service by Big Tech and initiate antitrust actions to end this racketeering and collusion by the Big Tech giants desperate to take back America.
[01:31:18.169 --> 01:31:20.689]  I've already had top law firms write him three briefings.
[01:31:21.369 --> 01:31:22.930]  I've already had them delivered.
[01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:24.810]  I already know that he picked up on
[01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:26.846]  Wait, it's the EU and the UN.
[01:31:28.198 --> 01:31:32.819]  Are already regulating our internet because we haven't put regulations on saying there is no regulation.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:39.601]  Then we've allowed them to come in tacitly or by fiat or by vacuum and begin regulating.
[01:31:39.621 --> 01:31:45.963]  He said that just a few days ago that he's looking at antitrust because especially because the outside powers are coming in and regulating because we're not.
[01:31:46.063 --> 01:31:53.905]  Again, you can have a prohibition regulation that says thou shall not with US government liability protection to those companies and trade threats back at the enemy.
[01:31:53.965 --> 01:31:57.166]  So we've always protected free speech, the internet from the EU, from the CHICOMS.
[01:31:57.366 --> 01:32:07.733]  Now that Obama removed those protections, it's allowed those to come in so they can come in with fines and regulations to bring our tech DARPA CIA command operation under their control.
[01:32:07.773 --> 01:32:08.673]  That's what this is all about.
[01:32:08.733 --> 01:32:10.575]  Make no mistake, that's what all these institutions are.
[01:32:10.655 --> 01:32:13.436]  And so we're demanding the president retake control of U.S.
[01:32:13.496 --> 01:32:15.538]  hardware in this modern fight, right?
[01:32:15.658 --> 01:32:16.739]  Trump.com.
[01:32:16.779 --> 01:32:19.420]  Again, we know exactly where to hit the enemy.
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:21.682]  Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
[01:32:22.162 --> 01:32:23.042]  That's why they hate us.
[01:32:23.122 --> 01:32:27.984]  We're loyal to America, we know what we're doing, and the enemy is completely and absolutely scared.
[01:32:28.064 --> 01:32:31.665]  So go to RightTrump.com today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:31.785 --> 01:32:34.226]  And don't forget, we have the biggest targeted sale.
[01:32:34.286 --> 01:32:39.488]  Not the biggest general sale, but on six items, it is the biggest sale ever.
[01:32:39.508 --> 01:32:40.728]  67% off a colloidal silver-silver bullet.
[01:32:41.148 --> 01:32:43.069]  57% off of Super Melon's Perfume of Vitality.
[01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:44.830]  It's incredible, but I want to move it all.
[01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:45.450]  I'll tell you why.
[01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:47.311]  They're trying to take our payment processes and shut us down.
[01:32:47.611 --> 01:32:50.512]  I have to sell off all of our product now before they're successful.
[01:32:50.572 --> 01:32:51.173]  I pray they're not.
[01:32:51.393 --> 01:32:56.035]  We got to move it all out to fund to the next junk phase and new funding I've secured in the new year.
[01:33:02.138 --> 01:33:04.739]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.089 --> 01:33:14.749]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:20.251]  Just a good old boy, never meanin' no harm.
[01:33:22.992 --> 01:33:27.713]  Beats all you never saw, been in trouble with the law since the day they was born.
[01:33:29.953 --> 01:33:34.334]  Straighten the curve, yeah, climb in the hills.
[01:33:37.015 --> 01:33:40.136]  Someday the mountain might get under the law.
[01:33:41.514 --> 01:33:43.775]  Owen Troyer riding shotgun with me.
[01:33:43.815 --> 01:33:47.256]  Roger Stone riding shotgun from Florida.
[01:33:47.876 --> 01:33:50.037]  They're covering the Democrats trying to openly steal the election.
[01:33:51.137 --> 01:33:55.518]  Next segment after Roger leaves us, or if he wants to stay with us, he's welcome because I want him to see this.
[01:33:57.299 --> 01:33:59.199]  Media matters and others have gone to the next level.
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:07.382]  These, I guess, anti-Trump black people, when you're at the Smithsonian,
[01:34:08.996 --> 01:34:11.377]  Saying, oh look, the jobs are up, it's great.
[01:34:12.758 --> 01:34:14.738]  Trump's got great polling numbers with black Americans.
[01:34:16.479 --> 01:34:18.220]  That comes over, bumps you, gets in your face.
[01:34:21.861 --> 01:34:28.664]  And then Media Matters cuts that off the front and says you're dehumanizing and attacking an innocent black family.
[01:34:29.745 --> 01:34:30.965]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:37.288]  And man, that's what's dangerous about this, is they then publish this all over.
[01:34:39.036 --> 01:34:45.280]  The country and the world and call for Owen to be taken off Facebook and Twitter now for bullying a poor black family.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:55.006]  Owen, he bullied Balazi Ford, a CIA operative whose story had more holes in it than a colander or Swiss cheese, who defamed a man.
[01:34:55.046 --> 01:34:57.628]  And now three of the other women have said it was all a fraud.
[01:34:58.248 --> 01:35:05.693]  You don't talk about a public figure who goes up in front of the Senate and says somebody raped her with zero evidence and zero proof.
[01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:09.350]  These people are unbelievable.
[01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:11.831]  But, that's all coming up next segment.
[01:35:13.391 --> 01:35:16.512]  I wanted to play this clip and get Roger's take on it, because it isn't about us.
[01:35:16.892 --> 01:35:26.834]  It is about us, but I wouldn't be covering this story about us if it wasn't so key, like a Rosetta Stone, or a skeleton key as I've called it, that gives you a window into everything.
[01:35:27.315 --> 01:35:34.496]  That Acosta, in front of dozens of live feeds, pushes her arm down, pulls back from her, she turns to look at security.
[01:35:34.516 --> 01:35:36.257]  It'll help me, what do I do?
[01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:37.277]  He's taking the mic from me.
[01:35:39.668 --> 01:35:55.961]  And then that turns into we edited the video because we blew it up, and then they have thousands of mainstream media, and Colbert and all the night shows, say we got caught in a lie, Acosta didn't even touch her, and Acosta goes on TV and said I never touched her, when he's lying and then they say we didn't see it.
[01:35:56.342 --> 01:35:57.943]  This is beyond 1984.
[01:35:59.758 --> 01:36:01.500]  This is beyond 2 plus 2 doesn't equal 4.
[01:36:02.382 --> 01:36:09.211]  So, let's play the president here and then get Roger Stone's take on them and move into Antifa and some other subject with both of you gentlemen, but here it is.
[01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:14.094]  What are you talking about?
[01:36:15.255 --> 01:36:15.876]  All that was?
[01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:17.657]  Nobody manipulated it.
[01:36:17.697 --> 01:36:18.537]  Give me a break.
[01:36:18.877 --> 01:36:20.598]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[01:36:20.878 --> 01:36:22.219]  All that is is a close-up.
[01:36:22.779 --> 01:36:25.541]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[01:36:25.941 --> 01:36:26.622]  I watched that.
[01:36:26.682 --> 01:36:27.762]  I heard that last night.
[01:36:28.062 --> 01:36:29.303]  They made it close-up.
[01:36:29.343 --> 01:36:30.504]  They showed it close-up.
[01:36:30.904 --> 01:36:32.865]  And he was not nice to that young woman.
[01:36:32.905 --> 01:36:33.866]  I don't hold him for that.
[01:36:34.646 --> 01:36:38.028]  Because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.
[01:36:38.288 --> 01:36:41.270]  But all that was, when you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy.
[01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:42.751]  Because it wasn't doctored.
[01:36:43.031 --> 01:36:44.512]  They gave a close-up view.
[01:36:44.692 --> 01:36:46.753]  That's not doctoring.
[01:36:46.793 --> 01:36:50.015]  So Fox News came out and said that we doctored it and were horrible people.
[01:36:50.315 --> 01:36:51.095]  And that he didn't touch her.
[01:36:51.235 --> 01:36:53.236]  So they defended him on multiple channels.
[01:36:53.977 --> 01:36:55.618]  Not all the Fox News, but some of them.
[01:36:56.158 --> 01:36:57.619]  MSNBC, they all lied about us.
[01:36:57.639 --> 01:36:58.800]  There's the president telling the truth.
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:00.460]  Getting what really went on.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.661]  And he's even being nice to Acosta.
[01:37:01.881 --> 01:37:02.742]  Lewandowski barely...
[01:37:03.322 --> 01:37:03.702]  I don't
[01:37:23.484 --> 01:37:24.605]  Owen Troyer, Roger Stone.
[01:37:25.045 --> 01:37:30.290]  Well, I think we should be focusing on the victim here, this nice young gal that was just trying to do her job.
[01:37:30.690 --> 01:37:33.052]  And you can see, I mean, I don't know how young this girl is.
[01:37:33.312 --> 01:37:34.313]  She's probably pretty young.
[01:37:34.553 --> 01:37:40.678]  You can see the horrific look she has in her face when Acosta rips her arm down and pulls the mic back.
[01:37:40.718 --> 01:37:41.559]  I mean, she's stunned.
[01:37:41.579 --> 01:37:42.359]  She doesn't know what to do.
[01:37:42.399 --> 01:37:46.883]  So I think we should be giving a lot more credence to the victim in this situation.
[01:37:46.903 --> 01:37:48.024]  Well, exactly.
[01:37:48.164 --> 01:37:52.507]  Under Democrat rules, because Wendowski brushed into the lady, they call that brutal assault.
[01:37:53.408 --> 01:37:55.849]  According to their metrics, he murdered that girl.
[01:37:56.169 --> 01:37:57.889]  Acosta murdered her in front of the President.
[01:37:58.109 --> 01:38:00.930]  He didn't, but that's what they would say, according to their metrics.
[01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:02.511]  I mean, Blasey Ford had no proof.
[01:38:02.811 --> 01:38:03.271]  Nobody.
[01:38:03.311 --> 01:38:04.451]  Her whole story didn't check out.
[01:38:04.491 --> 01:38:05.852]  All the witnesses said the opposite.
[01:38:07.472 --> 01:38:10.993]  So with the credibility here, we can say with more credibility, Acosta raped her.
[01:38:11.713 --> 01:38:15.614]  Well, I mean, there is more evidence that Acosta assaulted this woman.
[01:38:15.634 --> 01:38:16.715]  We can't see below the waist.
[01:38:16.755 --> 01:38:18.375]  How do we know he wasn't raping her at the same time?
[01:38:18.615 --> 01:38:19.735]  I'm not saying that, folks.
[01:38:19.775 --> 01:38:21.356]  I'm illustrating how absurd they are.
[01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:21.836]  Roger Stone?
[01:38:22.645 --> 01:38:24.746]  Yeah, let me put this another way, Alex.
[01:38:24.866 --> 01:38:25.707]  I think it's important.
[01:38:26.407 --> 01:38:29.729]  In no way has this video been altered.
[01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:33.731]  Zooming in on it is not doctoring.
[01:38:34.271 --> 01:38:39.073]  Slowing the speed down so you can see what happens very quickly is not doctoring.
[01:38:39.533 --> 01:38:41.694]  This video has not been altered.
[01:38:41.835 --> 01:38:46.437]  It is a true depiction on video of what actually happened.
[01:38:46.817 --> 01:38:50.699]  And anyone who says otherwise is spinning.
[01:38:51.964 --> 01:38:54.446]  The President was forthright and he's absolutely correct.
[01:38:54.786 --> 01:38:59.671]  The video produced by InfoWars was not altered in any way.
[01:39:00.051 --> 01:39:06.797]  It was simply a zoom so you could get a closer look and slowed down because the whole thing happened so quickly.
[01:39:07.138 --> 01:39:12.062]  This is one of the most egregious examples of fake news that I have ever seen.
[01:39:12.122 --> 01:39:14.224]  The attack on this video is 100% fake news.
[01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:20.344]  I'll tell you, Acosta is the enemy of truth.
[01:39:20.865 --> 01:39:23.587]  But see the whole media line up behind him and go with the hoax.
[01:39:24.628 --> 01:39:28.252]  To me, this is like a major watermark in history, the Acosta event.
[01:39:28.592 --> 01:39:33.456]  Because everybody I know, including Democrats and others, are saying, no, this is insane.
[01:39:33.817 --> 01:39:34.377]  They're lying.
[01:39:34.457 --> 01:39:35.158]  He did do that.
[01:39:37.068 --> 01:39:47.270]  Well, in all honesty, I spoke to two CNN reporters last night who kept insisting over and over again that the video had been doctored, which is just a that's just a falsehood.
[01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:49.271]  It was not altered in any way.
[01:39:49.311 --> 01:39:58.773]  What they're really upset about, Alex, is the firing of Jeff Sessions and the president grabbing control of his own Justice Department at long last.
[01:39:59.333 --> 01:40:07.898]  Obscured the entire staged story of juvenile, childish, provocative behavior by Jim Acosta.
[01:40:08.438 --> 01:40:25.468]  This was designed to be the big news story that day, and it got completely subsumed by the president's dramatic decision to essentially fire Jeff Sessions and appoint an attorney general who seems to me to be determined to rein in the excesses
[01:40:25.968 --> 01:40:26.648]  Of the Mueller investigation.
[01:40:26.768 --> 01:40:28.589]  And that brings us to the real enchilada.
[01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:30.170]  I've been distracted by the Acosta.
[01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:35.232]  It is a petty thing, but it's a window into how dumb they think we are, and that's why it's so incredibly important.
[01:40:35.532 --> 01:40:43.436]  It's petty, but the lies they told, saying he didn't even touch her, that we faked the whole video, that it's all like a cartoon graphic, is just next level.
[01:40:43.776 --> 01:40:45.417]  Let's get into this new Attorney General.
[01:40:45.457 --> 01:40:48.638]  I've been researching him, this new Deputy Attorney General, Matthew G. Whitaker.
[01:40:49.138 --> 01:40:50.679]  Boy, no wonder the deep state's scared, Roger.
[01:40:52.122 --> 01:40:55.104]  Yeah, first of all, he's an amazingly competent guy.
[01:40:55.184 --> 01:41:01.669]  He served as the chief of staff for the Justice Department under Attorney General John Ashcroft.
[01:41:02.269 --> 01:41:03.990]  He was himself a U.S.
[01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:05.631]  attorney in Iowa.
[01:41:06.032 --> 01:41:14.037]  He is very close to former Governor Terry Branstad, who currently serves as our ambassador to China.
[01:41:14.297 --> 01:41:15.098]  A very good man.
[01:41:16.158 --> 01:41:19.840]  And he is politically savvy, and that's what they're upset about.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.342]  He's both legally savvy and politically savvy.
[01:41:23.422 --> 01:41:36.289]  So they're now complaining that because he has expressed political views in the past, in which he said, in his opinion, Hillary should have been indicted regarding her lies in the missing email scandal.
[01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:39.591]  So to put this in perspective, it is okay
[01:41:40.231 --> 01:41:56.751]  For the Mueller prosecution force to have multiple Democratic activists who work for Hillary Clinton and who have written things in support of the Clinton or donated money to the Clintons, that's perfectly all right, but Trump's appointees must be apolitical?
[01:41:57.192 --> 01:41:58.494]  That is nonsense.
[01:41:58.934 --> 01:42:00.195]  And they go further.
[01:42:00.456 --> 01:42:04.660]  They were saying in the text messages and things that came out, saying, we're going to stop Trump.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.442]  We're going to insurance policy.
[01:42:06.702 --> 01:42:07.783]  We can't let him get in.
[01:42:07.843 --> 01:42:09.065]  They tried to defend that.
[01:42:09.605 --> 01:42:13.950]  So that is frothingly biased and trying to set people up.
[01:42:14.010 --> 01:42:17.613]  In fact, I want to do more on this and then we'll get into the media matters caught.
[01:42:18.614 --> 01:42:26.243]  Literally doctoring a video in the classic sense, editing out someone confronting you, getting in your face for no reason, and then your measured response.
[01:42:26.583 --> 01:42:33.211]  This is going to be really important, but I'm going to tell folks on the other side what little birdie wordies told me about
[01:42:33.251 --> 01:42:33.711]  No one will.
[01:42:58.277 --> 01:43:04.180]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.

[01:44:57.922 --> 01:45:01.605]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[01:45:01.885 --> 01:45:05.328]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[01:45:05.668 --> 01:45:15.195]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series, as well as the first ever double-blind FDA-cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[01:45:15.715 --> 01:45:19.140]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:24.467]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[01:45:24.507 --> 01:45:26.870]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[01:45:27.150 --> 01:45:31.816]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[01:45:31.836 --> 01:45:32.397]  Ah, you don't want that.
[01:45:32.797 --> 01:45:36.600]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:39.502]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[01:45:39.762 --> 01:45:43.064]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[01:45:43.445 --> 01:45:48.748]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.

[01:45:53.832 --> 01:45:56.594]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[01:46:01.035 --> 01:46:02.436]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[01:46:02.496 --> 01:46:03.937]  Victor, you're calling.
[01:46:03.997 --> 01:46:04.358]  Go ahead.
[01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:04.758]  Yes.
[01:46:05.178 --> 01:46:05.919]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:06.019 --> 01:46:12.204]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[01:46:12.424 --> 01:46:16.408]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[01:46:16.648 --> 01:46:18.089]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[01:46:18.449 --> 01:46:25.175]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[01:46:25.235 --> 01:46:28.097]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[01:46:28.978 --> 01:46:33.681]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[01:46:33.721 --> 01:46:41.547]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[01:46:41.567 --> 01:46:47.391]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[01:46:47.511 --> 01:46:52.835]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[01:46:52.915 --> 01:46:55.917]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[01:47:02.043 --> 01:47:04.687]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:33.763 --> 01:47:35.084]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:47:35.444 --> 01:47:36.165]  to 3 p.m.
[01:47:36.225 --> 01:47:36.725]  I'm here live.
[01:47:36.765 --> 01:47:37.706]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:47:38.486 --> 01:47:44.430]  This is the most banned, the most hated, the most demonized, the most lied about broadcast in the world by who?
[01:47:46.211 --> 01:47:51.214]  The globalists, the chi-coms, Hollywood, the Democratic Party, the blue blood neocon establishment.
[01:47:51.875 --> 01:47:56.898]  All the insiders that want to control everything and milk everything and cheat everything.
[01:47:59.127 --> 01:48:12.337]  Why are they so scared of the new acting AG who's got two months, well really he's got 200 plus days under the law, but two months for sure before this new House gets in, this new Congress gets in, to really clean house.
[01:48:12.957 --> 01:48:15.339]  Who is Matthew G. Whitaker and why are they so scared?
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.581]  Roger will give us his take when he's leaving us.
[01:48:18.121 --> 01:48:23.906]  We're going to get into media matters caught in massive doctoring a video of Owen Schroer in an attempt to silence him.
[01:48:23.926 --> 01:48:26.748]  So this is really criminal activity in my view and I'll explain why.
[01:48:27.776 --> 01:48:38.723]  But first, why are they so scared of this new acting Attorney General, and how do we make sure he maximizes the time and effort he's got in there for sure?
[01:48:38.743 --> 01:48:43.566]  200 plus days or so with the recess law that's there, and if Congress doesn't act it can stay longer.
[01:48:44.947 --> 01:48:45.568]  Well, I know why.
[01:48:46.028 --> 01:48:49.590]  And Roger just said it, showing the great political research Roger does.
[01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:50.491]  He said it last segment.
[01:48:51.516 --> 01:48:58.678]  This guy worked for the governor, has very close friends, who knows about the Chinese communist threat, who's been deployed to China so they know we're not playing games.
[01:49:00.119 --> 01:49:01.699]  They try to buy off whoever you send over there.
[01:49:02.039 --> 01:49:03.039]  So these are tough cookies.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:07.281]  He knows about the real threats, he knows about the globalists, he knows about the New World Order.
[01:49:07.761 --> 01:49:10.342]  He is a America, not globalism.
[01:49:10.682 --> 01:49:12.222]  Americanism, not globalism.
[01:49:12.822 --> 01:49:14.503]  And so they're really, really, really scared.
[01:49:15.751 --> 01:49:18.113]  He also knows about the Clinton Cabal.
[01:49:18.193 --> 01:49:19.674]  He's not afraid of them.
[01:49:20.175 --> 01:49:23.237]  He's willing to go after them and understands the country is in crisis.
[01:49:23.998 --> 01:49:29.082]  And even though it's going to be painful, the corruption must be removed because the corruption is going to destroy the nation.
[01:49:29.302 --> 01:49:36.808]  We're finally at that point of saying we need the military, we need the government, we need the Justice Department to stand up to the globalists, to kick them out, to not let foreign countries run us.
[01:49:37.609 --> 01:49:45.259]  And finally it's happening, so people need to understand, doesn't mean Trump's perfect, doesn't mean the Republicans are perfect, but they aren't out to destroy the country.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:47.723]  The Democrats don't want borders, they're globalists.
[01:49:48.595 --> 01:49:51.096]  We're kicking the neocons out that are also globalist.
[01:49:51.416 --> 01:49:52.896]  This is an American restoration.
[01:49:52.936 --> 01:49:54.257]  This is the retaking of the country.
[01:49:54.657 --> 01:49:59.058]  And I can't believe he's got the economy doing well and a bunch of other stuff stabilized while he's doing it.
[01:49:59.538 --> 01:50:02.519]  I mean, usually this stuff takes, you know, giant bloody civil wars.
[01:50:02.619 --> 01:50:06.260]  So Trump is really the master wizard at this point in my view.
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:18.284]  And I absolutely admire him because to see someone true and faithful and strong and honorable versus all these traitors and to see America coming back from the dead and nationalism come back from the dead all over the world is really a magic moment.
[01:50:18.704 --> 01:50:23.085]  Well, Alex, I think what's disturbing the Democrats so much is that the new acting Attorney General is an enormously capable attorney.
[01:50:44.153 --> 01:50:49.317]  He served as the chief of staff of the Justice Department under Attorney General John Ashcroft.
[01:50:49.757 --> 01:50:52.259]  He was himself a prosecuting U.S.
[01:50:52.299 --> 01:50:53.480]  attorney in Iowa.
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:51:02.767]  He also happens to be a person of faith, as someone who has been a conservative activist, which he, under the law, is entitled to.
[01:51:03.207 --> 01:51:11.574]  And he has opined, for example, that Hillary should have been prosecuted for her actions in the illegal
[01:51:11.854 --> 01:51:16.729]  He's a right-wing patriot Christian that's pro-American, is ready to stand up for the nation, and it's dark as hell.
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:22.441]  So immediately the Democrats say, oh, because he has political opinions, he should recuse himself.
[01:51:22.921 --> 01:51:28.582]  Well, if that were true, then the many members of the strike force of Robert Mueller should recuse themselves.
[01:51:29.062 --> 01:51:39.424]  We know that Andrew Weissman, his top prosecutor, applauded Sally Yates when she refused to carry out the president's orders on immigration.
[01:51:39.724 --> 01:51:46.085]  We know that he attended Hillary Clinton's election eve celebration.
[01:51:46.505 --> 01:51:55.452]  We know of the political contributions from the to the Democrats and Hillary Clinton from various members of the Mueller strike force.
[01:51:55.833 --> 01:52:04.299]  So it's OK for liberal Democrats to have to have a history of political and partisan activism when they're in the judicial branch.
[01:52:04.339 --> 01:52:06.241]  But it's not OK for Republicans.
[01:52:06.561 --> 01:52:08.402]  This is an absurd argument.
[01:52:09.262 --> 01:52:23.288]  And what they're afraid of is that up till now, Rod Rosenstein, who is a deep state quizling and a close associate of both James Comey and Robert Mueller, had oversight over the Mueller investigation.
[01:52:23.728 --> 01:52:33.492]  Now, an attorney general who believes in the rule of law and is not going to brook the kind of abuses we have seen by Mr. Mueller is in charge of that investigation.
[01:52:34.012 --> 01:52:40.855]  This is why, and this is a very key point, Alex, the Democrats in the House are soft-pedaling impeachment.
[01:52:41.276 --> 01:52:42.957]  We cannot let them get away with that.
[01:52:43.137 --> 01:52:43.637]  Oh no!
[01:52:44.177 --> 01:52:46.018]  We have no intention of impeaching Trump.
[01:52:46.258 --> 01:52:47.719]  We just want to investigate him.
[01:52:48.039 --> 01:52:49.860]  Well, what's the purpose of investigation?
[01:52:50.670 --> 01:52:53.352]  He cannot be indicted by a sitting president.
[01:52:53.833 --> 01:53:02.539]  The Justice Departments of both the Nixon and the Obama, pardon me, the Clinton Justice Department have issued opinions on that.
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:09.865]  So the only purpose for investigating the president by the Congress would be for the purposes of impeachment.
[01:53:09.905 --> 01:53:11.807]  That's right, so here's the final equation.
[01:53:12.327 --> 01:53:13.208]  Here's the final equation.
[01:53:13.869 --> 01:53:15.451]  Trump must take the gloves off.
[01:53:15.851 --> 01:53:17.553]  They're going on the offense against him.
[01:53:18.134 --> 01:53:20.577]  They had him hobbled before with the Controlled Justice Department.
[01:53:20.597 --> 01:53:21.518]  That's not the case now.
[01:53:21.858 --> 01:53:25.323]  He must go on the offense or they're going to be able to take down the relaunch of America.
[01:53:25.363 --> 01:53:26.784]  Roger Stone, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:53:27.605 --> 01:53:28.727]  Alex, great to be with you.
[01:53:29.167 --> 01:53:31.069]  All right, I want to get to this before the hour ends.
[01:53:32.048 --> 01:53:34.789]  You're about to see real doctored footage.
[01:53:35.529 --> 01:53:42.932]  As the President said earlier today, when we zoomed in to Sheva Costa karate chopping her arm and pulling the mic away and she looked scared and stood back.
[01:53:43.672 --> 01:53:44.673]  That was not doctored.
[01:53:44.713 --> 01:53:48.314]  That was zoomed in to make it clear and closer up.
[01:53:48.374 --> 01:53:50.535]  The opposite of deception when you zoom in.
[01:53:50.775 --> 01:53:51.935]  And the President's pointed that out.
[01:53:52.135 --> 01:53:52.956]  Our exact words.
[01:53:52.976 --> 01:53:53.496]  It's the truth.
[01:53:54.176 --> 01:54:02.292]  Now, Media Matters is running a big national campaign to have Owen Schroer taken off Twitter and Facebook now and unparsoned.
[01:54:02.773 --> 01:54:04.376]  And we can put their headline up on screen.
[01:54:05.492 --> 01:54:14.300]  And they're saying, because we dehumanize and harass and spread hate against innocent black American family who is trying to simply be at the Smithsonian.
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.361]  Well, the full video is like 20 minutes long.
[01:54:16.401 --> 01:54:17.342]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:54:17.362 --> 01:54:19.024]  We'll play a shorter clip now, but it's unedited.
[01:54:20.125 --> 01:54:21.906]  It's just in the context of them coming over to him.
[01:54:21.926 --> 01:54:25.369]  He's talking about black unemployment being the best, you know, ever.
[01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:26.950]  And now Trump's reaching out to African Americans.
[01:54:26.970 --> 01:54:27.411]  How great it is.
[01:54:27.791 --> 01:54:29.893]  These folks come over, start bumping him, saying, get out of here.
[01:54:30.233 --> 01:54:30.934]  They come over to him.
[01:54:31.454 --> 01:54:33.016]  They edit that off the front.
[01:54:34.493 --> 01:54:48.462]  Kanye West and Candace Owens are literally leading a brand new cultural revolution for African Americans in America right now.
[01:54:48.863 --> 01:54:51.004]  Getting themselves off the Democrat plantation.
[01:54:51.024 --> 01:54:51.865]  You think I'm crazy, man?
[01:54:52.445 --> 01:54:53.325]  Why do you think I'm crazy?
[01:54:56.167 --> 01:54:57.388]  I love that they're showing the hate.
[01:54:57.928 --> 01:54:58.469]  Here's the hate.
[01:54:59.850 --> 01:55:00.750]  Now he's coming up to me.
[01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.710]  Look at this.
[01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:02.330]  Oh my gosh.
[01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:03.351]  What is your deal, dude?
[01:55:03.451 --> 01:55:04.571]  Move away from me now!
[01:55:04.591 --> 01:55:06.971]  Dude, you literally came up to me.
[01:55:06.991 --> 01:55:07.451]  Here we go.
[01:55:07.471 --> 01:55:08.412]  She just knocked my head off.
[01:55:08.972 --> 01:55:09.532]  Thanks, guys.
[01:55:09.552 --> 01:55:10.492]  No, no.
[01:55:10.532 --> 01:55:11.812]  Thank you guys for showing the hate.
[01:55:12.192 --> 01:55:13.913]  Thank you guys so much for showing the hate out here.
[01:55:14.753 --> 01:55:16.393]  Thank you for showing the world how hateful you are.
[01:55:17.893 --> 01:55:18.634]  You came up to me.
[01:55:18.934 --> 01:55:19.754]  See, isn't it perfect?
[01:55:20.034 --> 01:55:20.374]  It's fine.
[01:55:20.674 --> 01:55:21.134]  No, it's fine.
[01:55:21.734 --> 01:55:23.594]  Thank you guys for showing the world how hateful you are.
[01:55:23.614 --> 01:55:25.395]  You guys are still in the cult.
[01:55:27.611 --> 01:55:29.151]  The full article's on Infowars.com.
[01:55:29.331 --> 01:55:31.592]  It says you're still in the cult, but you'll get it off the system.
[01:55:31.932 --> 01:55:34.173]  The full interview, the full thing's up there.
[01:55:34.533 --> 01:55:36.233]  Now, this is what Media Matters showed.
[01:55:36.253 --> 01:55:43.315]  They only showed 30 seconds, where it just looks like he's saying you're in the cult because you're at the Smithsonian for Black History Month.
[01:55:43.955 --> 01:55:45.615]  That sounds really mean and bad.
[01:55:45.895 --> 01:55:49.276]  He still has a right to do whatever he wanted to, but I'd fire him, and no one would ever do that.
[01:55:49.496 --> 01:55:50.917]  So here's what they showed.
[01:55:51.257 --> 01:55:55.938]  They don't show or come over saying you're crazy, knocking his hat off, him getting his face, them initiating assault.
[01:55:56.698 --> 01:55:57.559]  They just show this.
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:02.823]  You guys are still in the cult, but you guys can get out of the cult.
[01:56:03.844 --> 01:56:05.105]  This is how cult people behave.
[01:56:06.026 --> 01:56:10.230]  So they choose not to be part of the African-American revolution that's happening right now.
[01:56:11.071 --> 01:56:11.811]  So that's fine.
[01:56:12.652 --> 01:56:16.315]  No, I understand you don't want to be on film showing the world how hateful you are, but it's too late.
[01:56:16.355 --> 01:56:16.856]  You already did.
[01:56:17.576 --> 01:56:18.217]  You already did.
[01:56:19.478 --> 01:56:20.339]  Fuck butt, she says.
[01:56:21.391 --> 01:56:23.113]  Wow, that's always fun folks.
[01:56:23.854 --> 01:56:28.979]  It's always fun to put your Superman cape on and let the left show their hate.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:33.744]  So, they're trying to have you removed now and saying you're a racist.
[01:56:33.764 --> 01:56:35.486]  This is real defamation by George Soros.
[01:56:36.427 --> 01:56:37.508]  This is real defamation.
[01:56:37.928 --> 01:56:39.370]  That is pure doctored right there.
[01:56:40.131 --> 01:56:54.121]  Well, and you notice how, like you said, Alex, they make it out that I'm bullying them like, oh my gosh, if somebody just saw that video, they'd assume, okay, he just decided to put these people on camera and say they're in a cult, and I guess assume that they're all in the same family.
[01:56:54.141 --> 01:56:58.164]  That's also probably racist of Media Matters to assume they're all in the same family because they're black.
[01:56:58.204 --> 01:57:04.248]  I don't think that's the case, so that's kind of racist of them, but nonetheless, they don't show the guy literally, I mean, the guy's clearly
[01:57:04.748 --> 01:57:05.369]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:57:05.389 --> 01:57:06.932]  I guess maybe he's hopped up on drugs.
[01:57:07.012 --> 01:57:08.294]  I don't know anybody else who behaves like that.
[01:57:08.574 --> 01:57:15.205]  Comes up, gets in my face, you know, tells me to move, screams at me, and then whoever this other lady is comes up and knocks my head off.
[01:57:15.626 --> 01:57:16.587]  And you know what it is, Alex?
[01:57:17.768 --> 01:57:27.570]  I'm standing there doing my report in front of the African American History and Culture Museum there at the Smithsonian, because like you said, I was talking about the jobs numbers, I was talking about Kanye West.
[01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:41.734]  How great Kanye West is, and these people came over to try to stop your free speech, and that's now transmuted in the alchemy of George Soros and media matters, that you now just came up for no reason and got in the face of some poor people when they really assaulted you for no reason.
[01:57:42.214 --> 01:57:44.675]  That is the definition of inversion.
[01:57:45.095 --> 01:57:45.655]  They were hateful.
[01:57:45.975 --> 01:57:46.415]  We'll be back.
[01:57:52.935 --> 01:58:00.198]  I do want to remind you that here at InfoWars, we are completely and totally listener and viewer supported.
[01:58:00.698 --> 01:58:07.881]  So I want you to go to the InfoWars.com site right now and see some of the extraordinary specials that we are carrying.
[01:58:07.901 --> 01:58:18.985]  Without your loyal support, without your buying these products, whether they're the great nutraceuticals or our t-shirts or our books or any of our products, we literally cannot continue the fight.
[01:58:19.045 --> 01:58:26.568]  Now, if you are not in the market for one of our great nutraceuticals, and we've got some unbelievable sales, Silver Bullet at 67% off.
[01:58:26.708 --> 01:58:27.748]  This is one of my favorites.
[01:58:27.868 --> 01:58:31.410]  The finest colloidal silver product, I think, in the country.
[01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:45.735]  We use a special electronic process which provides for a smaller microbe and therefore greater absorbability of the colloidal silver, known for centuries as one of the most effective antiviral and antibacterial compounds.
[01:58:45.916 --> 01:58:47.056]  I use it whenever I feel
[01:58:47.276 --> 01:58:49.898]  A cold's coming on, and I highly recommend it.
[01:58:49.998 --> 01:58:53.820]  Brain Force Plus, which works extraordinarily well for me.
[01:58:54.101 --> 01:58:56.742]  You're looking at 50% off with free shipping.
[01:58:56.983 --> 01:59:00.145]  This gives me mental clarity, mental energy.
[01:59:00.305 --> 01:59:02.046]  This is an extraordinary product.
[01:59:02.166 --> 01:59:03.047]  I highly recommend it.
[01:59:03.167 --> 01:59:10.892]  And of course, you can grab a copy of my new book, Stone's Rules, at a very nice price on the InfoWars.com site.
[01:59:11.152 --> 01:59:11.272]  Right.
[01:59:11.452 --> 01:59:14.655]  All of those great products help fund the fight for freedom.
[01:59:14.776 --> 01:59:19.060]  We are completely and totally reliant on you in the fight ahead.
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:25.166]  It is not incidental that InfoWars has been at the focal point in the war of censorship.
[01:59:25.566 --> 01:59:30.911]  It is not incidental that we have been banned across all platforms on the same day.
[01:59:31.332 --> 01:59:32.232]  That's racketeering.
[01:59:32.573 --> 01:59:35.816]  That's the real collusion they don't want you to know about.
[01:59:35.936 --> 01:59:38.458]  This is an effort to destroy what Alex Jones has built.
[01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:39.879]  Don't let them get away with it.
[01:59:39.919 --> 01:59:41.900]  Go to the Infowars.com store right now.
[01:59:42.241 --> 01:59:44.743]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll be right back.
[01:59:44.763 --> 01:59:55.691]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:13.562]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:14.263 --> 02:00:20.186]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.567 --> 02:00:22.968]  I mean, Owen, we don't make ourselves victims.
[02:00:23.108 --> 02:00:23.749]  We're not victims.
[02:00:23.789 --> 02:00:24.349]  We're targets.
[02:00:24.369 --> 02:00:25.210]  We're revolutionaries.
[02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:25.930]  We're changing the world.
[02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:28.852]  But you're now on Media Matters sites.
[02:00:29.472 --> 02:00:31.694]  They want to take down Facebook pages with your show.
[02:00:32.254 --> 02:00:36.437]  They want to take you off Twitter because they say you brutalized, you dehumanized
[02:00:37.077 --> 02:00:58.722]  I'm just innocent loving family of African Americans and here comes meany Owen and he just starts calling him you know in the cult after they knock your hat off after they get in your face after he pushes you for no reason no matter how great it is that blacks unemployment is lowest ever and how wonderful Kanye West is Oh wonder wonderful love the Smithsonian black history
[02:00:59.682 --> 02:01:04.724]  Man, you are... and then Soros' goons edit that.
[02:01:05.004 --> 02:01:05.765]  Man, they're incredible.
[02:01:05.965 --> 02:01:09.346]  Can you imagine if we didn't even have a platform, how much worse the lives would be?
[02:01:09.366 --> 02:01:11.627]  They would say that you had murdered that family.
[02:01:11.767 --> 02:01:18.310]  Well, thank you for allowing me your platform to actually get the truth out, but Alex, this is exactly what they do to you, and this is the next level deception.
[02:01:18.670 --> 02:01:27.774]  Beyond just the editing of the video where they don't show the full video in context, and then they just, you know, basically show me responding to them getting aggressive with me,
[02:01:28.354 --> 02:01:29.594]  But what are they trying to do now?
[02:01:29.714 --> 02:01:37.417]  They want to ban the actual source of the video so that you can't go see the original video and know... That's right!
[02:01:37.457 --> 02:01:40.758]  That video's on that page with hundreds of thousands of... Oh, that... Exactly!
[02:01:41.098 --> 02:01:43.039]  Yeah, so that's the other target here.
[02:01:43.059 --> 02:01:43.839]  The target is, okay...
[02:01:44.419 --> 02:01:53.986]  First, let's deceptively edit a video and then lie about the individual, but then let's de-platform the individual and get rid of the actual source of the video to begin with.
[02:01:54.347 --> 02:01:57.309]  And so, that's kind of their little ballgame that they like to do here.
[02:01:57.329 --> 02:02:01.812]  But you know, Alex, the funny thing is that Media Matters are the real racists.
[02:02:02.032 --> 02:02:04.714]  They show it in this article where they assume these people are awful.
[02:02:04.734 --> 02:02:07.977]  Well, they're run and funded by a literal Nazi collaborator.
[02:02:08.157 --> 02:02:13.021]  But here's the thing, Alex, I don't talk differently because there's a black guy standing next to me.
[02:02:13.041 --> 02:02:13.781]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:02:13.981 --> 02:02:17.024]  I don't talk differently because there's a Mexican guy standing next to me.
[02:02:17.044 --> 02:02:21.207]  I remember I called you that morning and I said, hey, great job at the walk away, but I want you to go around town and shoot some reports.
[02:02:21.927 --> 02:02:23.508]  And you went around and shot like 10 reports.
[02:02:23.588 --> 02:02:25.650]  And, oh, it's the Smithsonian, talk about this.
[02:02:27.149 --> 02:02:32.134]  And of course, there's going to be... Oh, it's cultural appropriation because these people obviously are leftist racists.
[02:02:32.414 --> 02:02:34.416]  They've been taught whites are bad by MSNBC and CNN.
[02:02:34.757 --> 02:02:42.564]  So they think it's so weird to hear a white guy saying how great Kanye West is and how great black unemployment is and how proud this revolution is.
[02:02:43.205 --> 02:02:44.046]  So they can't have that.
[02:02:44.386 --> 02:02:58.970]  Well I think I should actually, I want to thank CNN and MSNBC and ABC and Media Matters and CBS and NBC for labeling us as racists and KKK members falsely and dehumanizing us and engaging in massive defamation of us.
[02:02:59.030 --> 02:03:06.052]  I want to thank the fake news out there, the enemy of the people that has put a target on our back for people like this.
[02:03:07.132 --> 02:03:08.712]  I don't even get free speech, you know.
[02:03:08.933 --> 02:03:18.555]  I can't walk around and say, hey, America's doing great, we got the jobs numbers up, I'm outside of the African-American history of culture, you know, and I'm just doing a live report.
[02:03:18.615 --> 02:03:22.176]  No, no, no, you don't get that free speech, Whitey with the Trump cap on.
[02:03:22.376 --> 02:03:23.476]  Get out of here, Cracker.
[02:03:23.676 --> 02:03:25.476]  And he literally goes, just move!
[02:03:26.357 --> 02:03:26.957]  Move!
[02:03:27.277 --> 02:03:30.798]  And then his friend or who knows comes over and knocks my hat off.
[02:03:31.158 --> 02:03:36.079]  But I'm the bad guy, Alex, but you'll never get to see that video because they will erase me off Facebook probably by the end of the day.
[02:03:36.559 --> 02:03:37.740]  Yeah, because that's how it works.
[02:03:38.481 --> 02:03:40.823]  Because a Nazi collaborator helped round up his fellow Jews.
[02:03:41.824 --> 02:03:42.745]  He overthrows countries!
[02:03:42.825 --> 02:03:43.486]  He kills people!
[02:03:43.546 --> 02:03:44.247]  He's a criminal!
[02:03:45.108 --> 02:03:46.089]  But here's what's even worse.
[02:03:46.529 --> 02:03:48.851]  It's all over the news that we doctored Acosta.
[02:03:48.891 --> 02:03:49.592]  He never touched her.
[02:03:49.632 --> 02:03:50.453]  He said, I never touched her.
[02:03:50.693 --> 02:03:51.294]  Total lie!
[02:03:51.314 --> 02:03:51.975]  We didn't doctor anything.
[02:03:51.995 --> 02:03:52.595]  We zoomed in on it.
[02:03:52.855 --> 02:03:54.958]  As the president said, but there's your real doctoring.
[02:03:55.518 --> 02:03:57.379]  There's your real doctoring, right there.
[02:03:57.659 --> 02:04:04.462]  And then the manipulation of reality to go and say you have to remove that channel off of Facebook so that you can't see the full video.
[02:04:04.562 --> 02:04:09.404]  They're like, the dehumanization of the innocent black family is the most chilling hate we've ever seen.
[02:04:09.845 --> 02:04:12.166]  He makes them literally grovel in fear.
[02:04:12.186 --> 02:04:14.887]  Schreuer, a known white supremacist commando.
[02:04:19.172 --> 02:04:19.692]  It's funny though.
[02:04:20.093 --> 02:04:23.636]  At a certain level, man, these people are such flaming liars, dude.
[02:04:24.036 --> 02:04:25.857]  It is like, whoa!
[02:04:27.038 --> 02:04:28.740]  All I can say is America's coming back.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:29.981]  Move, bitch!
[02:04:30.241 --> 02:04:31.262]  Get out the way!
[02:04:31.282 --> 02:04:32.403]  Get out the way, bitch!
[02:04:32.443 --> 02:04:33.303]  Move out the way!
[02:04:33.564 --> 02:04:35.085]  You see them headlights?
[02:04:35.105 --> 02:04:36.466]  Wait, we need to do the remix with that.
[02:04:36.646 --> 02:04:37.867]  I'm doing 100 on the highway.
[02:04:37.887 --> 02:04:39.648]  Because there goes cultural appropriation.
[02:04:39.668 --> 02:04:41.070]  Because that guy says, move!
[02:04:41.730 --> 02:04:42.110]  Move!
[02:04:42.190 --> 02:04:42.971]  We need to do the remix.
[02:04:42.991 --> 02:04:43.872]  Little box-in TVs, bitch.
[02:04:43.912 --> 02:04:44.472]  Tell me that.
[02:04:45.113 --> 02:04:47.255]  You're getting my... I said move, Whitey!
[02:04:48.075 --> 02:04:48.956]  Move, cracker!
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.946]  Unbelievable brainwashing on the left.
[02:04:53.568 --> 02:04:54.751]  It's just so funny, man.
[02:04:54.771 --> 02:04:56.557]  But the great thing is most black folks are waking up.
[02:04:56.577 --> 02:04:56.978]  It's beautiful.
[02:04:56.998 --> 02:04:57.340]  We love them.
[02:04:59.295 --> 02:05:01.336]  You need to support independent media that's under attack.
[02:05:01.376 --> 02:05:04.799]  We're under attack by these globalists, as you know, and your support's been amazing.
[02:05:04.839 --> 02:05:18.107]  We make it easy to support us because we have great products, and we're announcing a mega blowout sale at Infowarsstore.com to fund us into the new year so we have a budget to continue on in the face of their attacks.

[02:06:00.689 --> 02:06:01.370]  Big Brother.
[02:06:01.831 --> 02:06:03.053]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:03.633 --> 02:06:04.655]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:05.536 --> 02:06:06.958]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:07.219 --> 02:06:08.400]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:08.881 --> 02:06:13.908]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.213 --> 02:06:33.613]  I'm watching the midterms.
[02:06:34.133 --> 02:06:37.514]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[02:06:37.994 --> 02:06:41.695]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[02:06:45.656 --> 02:06:47.557]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[02:06:47.597 --> 02:06:48.397]  You bought a truck?
[02:06:48.417 --> 02:06:51.177]  You bought a truck?
[02:06:51.298 --> 02:06:52.498]  Yeah!
[02:06:52.518 --> 02:06:52.918]  Bitch!
[02:06:53.378 --> 02:06:54.458]  What the fuck?
[02:06:55.338 --> 02:06:58.239]  Bitch!
[02:06:58.399 --> 02:06:58.999]  What the fuck?
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.680]  You are the president.
[02:07:05.281 --> 02:07:27.533]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[02:07:30.678 --> 02:07:32.799]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:07:33.319 --> 02:07:38.521]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:07:40.442 --> 02:07:42.343]  Well, I'm very, very thankful they survived.
[02:07:42.623 --> 02:07:43.503]  Twelve others didn't.
[02:07:44.304 --> 02:07:47.245]  Alex Shadoff and Ali Chandra.
[02:07:49.326 --> 02:07:51.267]  Alex Chadov is a 20-year-old college student.
[02:07:51.287 --> 02:07:55.628]  He attends California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, California, pursuing a degree in criminal justice.
[02:07:55.908 --> 02:08:00.309]  His girlfriend, Allie Chandra, is a 21-year-old college student.
[02:08:00.669 --> 02:08:04.910]  She attends Pierce College in Chatsworth, California, and she is pursuing a degree in business.
[02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:06.871]  They both work at the Thousand Oaks Club.
[02:08:07.791 --> 02:08:10.852]  California during the recent nightmare shooting two nights ago.
[02:08:10.872 --> 02:08:15.253]  They are strong advocates of the Second Amendment and they didn't want to be basically misrepresented.
[02:08:15.293 --> 02:08:17.854]  Just like you saw at Parkland, which is a shooting that happened.
[02:08:17.914 --> 02:08:18.754]  I didn't say it didn't happen.
[02:08:19.074 --> 02:08:23.855]  I said out of 3,000 students, they picked four anti-gunners to go out and be the spokesperson for everybody.
[02:08:23.875 --> 02:08:25.656]  But we're very glad they survived.
[02:08:26.316 --> 02:08:26.696]  They joined us.
[02:08:26.816 --> 02:08:29.277]  They're also very close to the death-like inferno
[02:08:30.097 --> 02:08:32.458]  And California's a beautiful state and has a lot of great people in it.
[02:08:33.258 --> 02:08:37.239]  But also it's got some hellish qualities to it so they can report on that.
[02:08:37.499 --> 02:08:40.219]  They'll also give us their take on ex-Marine with PTSD.
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:51.902]  Posted on Instagram with a gun in one hand and a phone in the other as he killed 12 people at a country bar massacre as it's revealed he was bullied for his lazy eye in high school.
[02:08:52.662 --> 02:08:54.723]  Oh, so then you go kill some innocent people.
[02:08:54.803 --> 02:08:54.983]  What?
[02:08:55.819 --> 02:08:57.400]  This guy should have been in a mental institution.
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:08:58.880]  In fact, he'd been in one, reportedly.
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:01.521]  This is just horrible, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:01.901 --> 02:09:04.502]  But again, are they going to ban Instagram and other things?
[02:09:05.102 --> 02:09:05.762]  Like Facebook?
[02:09:05.802 --> 02:09:07.143]  Because, remember?
[02:09:07.243 --> 02:09:12.885]  Oh, it was the fault of Gab that the guy four minutes before he went into the Jewish temple and did that other horrible monster.
[02:09:13.685 --> 02:09:14.665]  Wow, this is incredible.
[02:09:14.846 --> 02:09:17.046]  So Alex and Allie, thanks for your courage.
[02:09:17.346 --> 02:09:18.107]  Thanks for being here.
[02:09:19.807 --> 02:09:24.549]  Please tell us, wherever you want to start here, with your experience and what you want to say.
[02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:27.706]  Well, thank you for having us, Alex.
[02:09:27.726 --> 02:09:28.907]  It means a lot to having us on.
[02:09:29.507 --> 02:09:31.869]  Do you want to tell our story about what happened?
[02:09:32.209 --> 02:09:32.670]  Absolutely!
[02:09:32.730 --> 02:09:36.072]  I just want you, whatever, because you guys wanted to come on, and I'm glad you're here.
[02:09:36.512 --> 02:09:45.058]  And I have a tendency to run on myself, so just whatever it is you want to get out out front, what happened that night, why you want to speak about the Second Amendment, just, I mean, you got the floor, both of you.
[02:09:46.119 --> 02:09:47.100]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:48.201]  So what happened was,
[02:09:49.062 --> 02:09:53.323]  We go to the bars called the Borderline.
[02:09:53.983 --> 02:09:55.764]  And what it is there, it's like a country bar.
[02:09:55.824 --> 02:09:59.405]  So people go there to dance, people go there to line dance, people go there to two-step.
[02:10:00.085 --> 02:10:06.427]  And it's just a place me and my girlfriend go every week on Wednesdays for our Polish day.
[02:10:08.008 --> 02:10:15.050]  And this Wednesday, we got there about nine o'clock and we were having a fine time.
[02:10:15.070 --> 02:10:16.210]  We were sitting over
[02:10:17.617 --> 02:10:20.299]  On the right side of the building, kind of a DJ booth.
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:29.667]  And at about 1120, we heard what was sounded like a table being knocked over.
[02:10:30.908 --> 02:10:32.089]  So we didn't think anything of it.
[02:10:32.749 --> 02:10:34.971]  But then it kept happening.
[02:10:35.091 --> 02:10:37.273]  And it sounded like balloons are popping except way louder.
[02:10:37.293 --> 02:10:41.376]  And they were like, this is, this is a gun.
[02:10:42.016 --> 02:10:45.179]  And so what we did was we went behind our DJ booth.
[02:10:46.258 --> 02:10:47.299]  Shots were ringing out.
[02:10:47.399 --> 02:10:48.739]  Those shots were non-stop.
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:50.800]  Those shots would not stop going.
[02:10:50.961 --> 02:10:52.821]  It was maybe 20, 30 shots.
[02:10:54.202 --> 02:10:56.483]  And people were screaming.
[02:10:56.503 --> 02:10:58.404]  And we were just hiding.
[02:10:58.424 --> 02:11:05.608]  And then somebody took a... Someone got the fire extinguisher or something.
[02:11:05.668 --> 02:11:09.430]  Someone broke one window that was near us.
[02:11:09.730 --> 02:11:12.812]  So then we were like, okay, the gunman knows where we are.
[02:11:13.607 --> 02:11:14.448]  We have to get out.
[02:11:14.708 --> 02:11:16.149]  So what we did was, yeah.
[02:11:16.229 --> 02:11:17.130]  We can't keep hiding.
[02:11:17.210 --> 02:11:18.671]  Yeah, and then we jumped out the window.
[02:11:18.691 --> 02:11:21.393]  We jumped out one of the windows, which was pretty high.
[02:11:21.433 --> 02:11:22.234]  Yeah, it was a high window.
[02:11:22.274 --> 02:11:25.236]  Somebody, there was a guy who jumped out and he was catching people.
[02:11:25.276 --> 02:11:26.317]  He caught me and you.
[02:11:26.357 --> 02:11:28.379]  Yeah, it was pretty... My friend, unfortunately, didn't get caught.
[02:11:28.939 --> 02:11:29.840]  Yeah, she got hurt.
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:31.501]  Wow.
[02:11:31.901 --> 02:11:34.503]  And she had to get some stitches.
[02:11:34.524 --> 02:11:35.364]  Yeah, she was fine.
[02:11:35.384 --> 02:11:36.465]  She didn't get caught.
[02:11:36.485 --> 02:11:42.590]  There was a lot of people getting thrown off balconies because there was no other escape, because she was at the front entrance, so obviously,
[02:11:43.792 --> 02:11:46.374]  You need to find a way out some other way.
[02:11:46.474 --> 02:11:48.276]  A guy punched a window just to get out.
[02:11:48.676 --> 02:11:49.177]  Yeah.
[02:11:49.197 --> 02:11:52.319]  And, um, yeah, so what we did was we jumped out the window.
[02:11:52.339 --> 02:11:53.000]  And ran.
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:53.681]  And ran.
[02:11:53.761 --> 02:11:54.641]  My arm is bleeding.
[02:11:54.822 --> 02:11:56.863]  I got cut from the window.
[02:11:58.264 --> 02:12:07.132]  So this demon, it appeared, he came in and shot the lady at the front, shot a bouncer, and then was trying to obviously block the exits so he could kill as many as possible.
[02:12:08.874 --> 02:12:09.094]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:10.677 --> 02:12:16.699]  I'm sorry.
[02:12:17.379 --> 02:12:18.079]  I could imagine.
[02:12:18.099 --> 02:12:18.579]  Wow.
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:25.301]  And 12 people killed, including this mentally ill monster.
[02:12:25.321 --> 02:12:38.585]  You know, I've said this, I think bars and big places, I don't think you can make it a law, but I think if people said there's a security fee, a dollar per person or whatever, you should have two armed guards at any big bar or place.
[02:12:39.065 --> 02:12:39.365]  I feel like
[02:13:04.813 --> 02:13:06.254]  He knew it was a gun-free zone.
[02:13:06.334 --> 02:13:09.156]  He knew it was targeted at someone that we were completely defenseless.
[02:13:09.637 --> 02:13:11.879]  He probably knew that the security guards didn't have guns.
[02:13:11.899 --> 02:13:19.725]  So if he knew that people were armed in there, it would have been less of a chance of a shooting happening.
[02:13:19.805 --> 02:13:20.445]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:20.565 --> 02:13:22.447]  Like, we have security guards there.
[02:13:22.647 --> 02:13:23.728]  But he knew it was gun-free.
[02:13:23.748 --> 02:13:24.809]  Yeah, it's a gun-free zone.
[02:13:25.555 --> 02:13:27.658]  He could have gone in there and he has the upper hand.
[02:13:27.939 --> 02:13:28.540]  Exactly.
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:31.264]  I believe that there should have been security there.
[02:13:31.905 --> 02:13:35.070]  Even if people... I mean, one idea that we
[02:13:35.842 --> 02:13:43.969]  Talked to somebody about was the idea of like, if you have a carry permit, if you have the right to carry, have a wristband.
[02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:45.811]  So we know who it's on.
[02:13:45.831 --> 02:13:49.014]  Yeah, we talked to Kate Benning yesterday and she talked about it with us.
[02:13:49.034 --> 02:13:49.834]  I thought it was a good idea.
[02:13:49.914 --> 02:13:52.256]  And then the left will go, oh, but then you'd shoot people.
[02:13:52.336 --> 02:13:54.458]  No, the people with the concealed carry have the lowest crime rate.
[02:13:54.959 --> 02:13:57.181]  A crazy person isn't going to fall the law.
[02:13:58.502 --> 02:13:59.062]  Exactly.
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:05.502]  Well, I mean, let's pull back and expand on this because they're blaming the Second Amendment as usual.
[02:14:06.723 --> 02:14:10.784]  We have people running over folks with cars, stabbing people everywhere, people poisoning people.
[02:14:10.824 --> 02:14:12.185]  This is a mental illness problem.
[02:14:12.525 --> 02:14:15.006]  You guys obviously have talked to police, you've talked to other survivors.
[02:14:15.947 --> 02:14:18.448]  They're saying he did it because he had a lazy eye, people were mean to him in high school.
[02:14:19.212 --> 02:14:25.775]  Who knows if that's even true, because I don't really believe much comes out of the Daily Mail, quite frankly, because they lie about me.
[02:14:25.855 --> 02:14:27.175]  Do you guys have any ideas?
[02:14:27.616 --> 02:14:30.477]  Was this guy involuntarily celibate?
[02:14:30.657 --> 02:14:38.460]  Because most of these shooters end up being incels, involuntarily celibate, are creepy, they have trouble picking up girls, and are mad at women.
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:39.761]  Have you heard any of that from anybody?
[02:14:41.002 --> 02:14:42.202]  I don't know anything about that.
[02:14:42.222 --> 02:14:48.705]  The only thing I know was that he grew up in our town, which was Thousand Oaks.
[02:14:50.084 --> 02:14:52.165]  And I don't know anything about him.
[02:14:52.205 --> 02:14:52.545]  It's possible.
[02:14:52.565 --> 02:14:53.025]  I'm not sure though.
[02:14:53.065 --> 02:14:53.385]  I'm not sure.
[02:15:11.792 --> 02:15:20.756]  Talk to you guys about what you want the world to know, because I know a lot of folks who are pro-Second Amendment, you see people being put on the news who are all anti-Second Amendment, so you can hit the floor when we come back.
[02:15:21.076 --> 02:15:32.262]  And by the way, if people want to contact you further, you guys are both on Twitter, at, and your last name, at C-H-A-T-O-F-F, at ChatOff, so that's
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:47.582]  We'll put that on screen for folks when we come back.
[02:15:47.622 --> 02:15:51.023]  Two of the survivors of this event of evil.
[02:15:51.043 --> 02:15:52.864]  It's not a gun event, it's an event of evil.
[02:15:52.884 --> 02:15:53.804]  When we come back, stay with us.
[02:16:01.721 --> 02:16:03.923]  I mean, these people get mailed these devices.
[02:16:04.003 --> 02:16:05.584]  It turns out they're fake devices.
[02:16:06.265 --> 02:16:09.267]  And it's all over the news that, oh my God, Trump's got to be impeached.
[02:16:09.688 --> 02:16:11.569]  You know, his hateful rhetoric's causing it.
[02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:17.274]  Anybody could mail themselves something, or have it delivered, and then say they're a victim.
[02:16:17.294 --> 02:16:18.796]  And it starts in the hierarchy of the Democrats.
[02:16:18.816 --> 02:16:21.158]  George Soros, the Clintons, Obama, right down.
[02:16:21.478 --> 02:16:23.520]  I mean, take this package that got mailed to me today.
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:24.360]  Dr. McCambshot, please.
[02:16:25.521 --> 02:16:26.082]  I mean, right here.
[02:16:27.182 --> 02:16:27.662]  What is this?
[02:16:27.682 --> 02:16:28.262]  They were telling me.
[02:16:28.963 --> 02:16:30.363]  I mean, did a Democrat mail this to me?
[02:16:30.383 --> 02:16:32.304]  Because it says Alex Jones.
[02:16:33.565 --> 02:16:37.286]  Hillary Clinton, 50 Dark Heart Lane, Columbus, California, 90666.
[02:16:38.747 --> 02:16:40.788]  How in the hell do they have our real address?
[02:16:41.949 --> 02:16:44.029]  Gosh, that even looks more real than what they mailed.
[02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:45.910]  And of course, just like CNN did.
[02:16:45.930 --> 02:16:47.551]  We're not going to treat this like it's a real bomb.
[02:16:47.571 --> 02:16:48.531]  Let's just get right in here.
[02:16:49.212 --> 02:16:50.792]  Wow, that looks a lot more real.
[02:16:51.093 --> 02:16:52.433]  Whoa, Hillary's face is on it.
[02:16:53.213 --> 02:16:54.114]  That means she sent it.
[02:16:55.473 --> 02:16:57.934]  They put right-wing stuff on there, whatever that means, the right-wing Senate.
[02:16:58.254 --> 02:16:59.135]  Hillary sent this.
[02:16:59.175 --> 02:16:59.975]  Her picture's on it.
[02:17:00.055 --> 02:17:02.656]  Clearly, Democrats just sent me this bomb.
[02:17:02.876 --> 02:17:03.777]  Oh my gosh, what is this?
[02:17:03.797 --> 02:17:04.817]  They just dynamite.
[02:17:05.157 --> 02:17:06.158]  Twin dynamites.
[02:17:06.618 --> 02:17:07.158]  Here in Austin.
[02:17:07.218 --> 02:17:08.339]  We've been sent dynamite.
[02:17:08.399 --> 02:17:08.819]  Hold on, Alex.
[02:17:08.859 --> 02:17:09.039]  Hold on.
[02:17:09.059 --> 02:17:09.299]  No, no.
[02:17:09.659 --> 02:17:11.360]  In fact, whoever sent this is a bomber.
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:12.641]  Doesn't matter it's fake.
[02:17:12.881 --> 02:17:13.881]  Doesn't matter it's satire.
[02:17:14.121 --> 02:17:16.142]  Doesn't matter it didn't really happen.
[02:17:16.402 --> 02:17:17.323]  The clock is ticking.
[02:17:17.363 --> 02:17:17.903]  There's a clock.
[02:17:18.183 --> 02:17:19.244]  Hillary's picture's on it.
[02:17:20.024 --> 02:17:20.924]  These aren't road flares.
[02:17:20.944 --> 02:17:22.105]  These are TNT dynamite.
[02:17:22.225 --> 02:17:24.226]  Hillary Clinton tried to bomb Infowars.
[02:17:24.386 --> 02:17:26.468]  Okay, Owen, you were sent this to Alex Jones.
[02:17:26.508 --> 02:17:27.169]  Hold on, Alex.
[02:17:27.209 --> 02:17:31.814]  Look at what the... This is to Alex Jones, but from Soros Headquarters.
[02:17:32.654 --> 02:17:33.195]  Alex, read that.
[02:17:33.215 --> 02:17:33.836]  What is that?
[02:17:34.016 --> 02:17:38.240]  Soros Headquarters, 666 Hale Highway, Bathamette, New York.
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:39.181]  Oh my gosh, and look at this.
[02:17:39.201 --> 02:17:40.863]  This actually came in the priority mail.
[02:17:40.903 --> 02:17:42.805]  This is an official priority mail box.
[02:17:42.945 --> 02:17:44.366]  Clearly official.
[02:17:44.427 --> 02:17:46.268]  I mean, look at how... I mean, Alex...
[02:17:46.989 --> 02:17:47.769]  This is amazing.
[02:17:48.089 --> 02:17:49.210]  This was just dropped off.
[02:17:49.230 --> 02:17:50.430]  This was just dropped off by the mail.
[02:17:50.450 --> 02:17:51.471]  George Soros sent me a bomb.
[02:17:51.491 --> 02:17:52.691]  This was just dropped off by the mail.
[02:17:52.711 --> 02:17:53.391]  Let's look in it now.
[02:17:53.431 --> 02:17:54.332]  Or somebody in his house did.
[02:17:54.352 --> 02:17:56.332]  I don't know if this just got dropped off by the mail.
[02:17:56.392 --> 02:17:56.932]  Okay, whoa!
[02:17:57.193 --> 02:17:58.633]  I'm not even worried about it.
[02:17:58.673 --> 02:17:59.273]  Oh my gosh!
[02:17:59.433 --> 02:18:00.154]  Oh, another bomb?
[02:18:00.194 --> 02:18:01.154]  Oh my gosh!
[02:18:01.294 --> 02:18:05.135]  And look, it's got a microchip on it, got some circuitry.
[02:18:05.595 --> 02:18:06.656]  It's counting down here.
[02:18:06.676 --> 02:18:07.796]  Oh, it says bomb!
[02:18:07.876 --> 02:18:08.817]  It even says bomb!
[02:18:09.037 --> 02:18:09.477]  Oh no!
[02:18:10.217 --> 02:18:10.777]  It says bomb on it!
[02:18:10.797 --> 02:18:12.499]  Hold on, I'm really sc- Mike, oh, oh!
[02:18:12.739 --> 02:18:13.959]  George Soros is on it!
[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:15.200]  Uh, mine's ticking.
[02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:16.181]  Yours is ticking as well?
[02:18:16.301 --> 02:18:16.801]  It's ticking.
[02:18:16.861 --> 02:18:18.242]  This one says bomb, what does that mean?
[02:18:18.382 --> 02:18:21.724]  Well, I got this box here and it's from Debbie Wasserman Schultz?
[02:18:22.645 --> 02:18:23.766]  From Fraud Florida?
[02:18:23.906 --> 02:18:24.646]  Oh, oh no!
[02:18:24.706 --> 02:18:25.407]  It's another bomb.
[02:18:25.867 --> 02:18:27.488]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz sent you a bomb.
[02:18:27.508 --> 02:18:28.289]  You got her face on it.
[02:18:28.689 --> 02:18:29.469]  She looks a little frustrated.
[02:18:29.489 --> 02:18:30.890]  Hold on, hold on, we gotta broadcast from the road.
[02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:31.891]  Everybody get out of the office!
[02:18:32.391 --> 02:18:33.472]  Everybody get out of the office!
[02:18:34.634 --> 02:18:37.215]  Oh my God, it's Debbie Wasserman Schultz, cross-eyed.
[02:18:37.235 --> 02:18:38.115]  Well, that's definitely her.
[02:18:38.175 --> 02:18:39.215]  That's a real picture of her.
[02:18:39.335 --> 02:18:40.916]  So that's left-wing, folks.
[02:18:40.976 --> 02:18:45.237]  This is the rhetoric of Soros and Schultz and Hillary, you know, saying we're all evil and fake news.
[02:18:45.277 --> 02:18:50.979]  This caused someone who's their supporter to send us these bombs that are set to detonate.
[02:18:51.279 --> 02:18:53.579]  This one's set to detonate at 5.10 today.
[02:18:54.119 --> 02:18:56.080]  This one's set to detonate in about 30 seconds.
[02:18:56.620 --> 02:18:58.121]  This one's set, this just says bomb.
[02:18:58.321 --> 02:18:59.341]  These are clear bombs.
[02:18:59.841 --> 02:19:01.142]  I mean, just look at this.
[02:19:01.202 --> 02:19:03.023]  High, high circuitry here.
[02:19:03.203 --> 02:19:04.244]  Very complex.
[02:19:04.364 --> 02:19:10.648]  I mean, this is not the work of an... It'll take weeks until after the election to figure out what Democrat sent us this, but we've got clues here.
[02:19:10.968 --> 02:19:13.510]  But this has been satire before they said we put out a fake bomb hoax.
[02:19:13.810 --> 02:19:16.352]  No, it's the Democrats that have been caught that did that.
[02:19:16.972 --> 02:19:25.678]  And they're the ones, and we're just illustrating how anybody could just deliver crap like this and then say it's real, but all the experts say it's not, and they're still breathlessly doing this.
[02:19:25.998 --> 02:19:27.039]  This is their false flag.
[02:19:27.099 --> 02:19:27.900]  This is ridiculous.
[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:28.760]  Oh, these aren't real?
[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:29.641]  These aren't real?
[02:19:30.401 --> 02:19:30.821]  No, no.
[02:19:31.021 --> 02:19:31.862]  No, this is a bombing.
[02:19:32.282 --> 02:19:33.142]  Didn't you see CNN?
[02:19:33.262 --> 02:19:35.263]  Yeah, just a... Exactly, a bombing happened.
[02:19:35.303 --> 02:19:36.684]  Nobody's been... No, this is a bombing.
[02:19:37.544 --> 02:19:42.446]  And why don't we... We should be like Jayco on CNN when he said he was in the Gulf War getting bombed.
[02:19:42.666 --> 02:19:43.066]  He wasn't.
[02:19:43.146 --> 02:19:43.447]  And he wasn't.
[02:19:43.487 --> 02:19:44.587]  Or the babies in incubators.
[02:19:44.667 --> 02:19:46.648]  Boom!
[02:19:47.468 --> 02:19:51.670]  It's a bombing!
[02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:52.550]  It's a real bomb!
[02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:53.411]  Boom, boom, boom!
[02:19:53.431 --> 02:19:53.911]  Get down!
[02:20:02.518 --> 02:20:05.127]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.316 --> 02:20:48.492]  We have a fascinating guest, I mean fascinating, I'm not gonna even get into who it is, coming up next segment, but I have three daughters, I have a son, and I really worry about my son, but there's this genetic thing with men, like your son, you just can't help but not, I treat him great, but you just, he's 16 now and I care about him, but you're tough on him.
[02:20:49.033 --> 02:20:49.693]  My daughters though.
[02:20:51.061 --> 02:20:55.142]  I could not ever imagine some demon piece of crap killing them.
[02:20:55.222 --> 02:20:56.362]  And most of these guys are incels.
[02:20:56.382 --> 02:20:59.823]  In fact, everyone so far has been on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:21:00.963 --> 02:21:04.244]  Some of them have been in the military, but most of them are like, you know, black trench coats.
[02:21:05.284 --> 02:21:06.204]  They're like communists.
[02:21:06.224 --> 02:21:06.804]  They're Nazis.
[02:21:06.844 --> 02:21:07.984]  Whatever's dirty, they're into it.
[02:21:08.504 --> 02:21:10.785]  And then they're mad at girls that were mean to them.
[02:21:11.165 --> 02:21:14.045]  Now we learn he went to a psychiatrist right before, went on psychotropics.
[02:21:14.085 --> 02:21:14.665]  It's always the same.
[02:21:14.986 --> 02:21:15.586]  There's articles.
[02:21:16.546 --> 02:21:16.906]  Shrimp!
[02:21:17.932 --> 02:21:20.053]  Commit suicide from Prozac runoff.
[02:21:20.313 --> 02:21:21.194]  Put it on screen, I'm not kidding.
[02:21:21.414 --> 02:21:21.894]  Fox News.
[02:21:22.574 --> 02:21:28.998]  There's so much Prozac runoff in the water that fish aren't scared anymore and swim up to birds and are more aggressive.
[02:21:29.318 --> 02:21:32.460]  And it'll just start like, like a foot-long fish will start attacking a pelican.
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:35.201]  They're in a shrimp on Prozac commit suicide.
[02:21:35.581 --> 02:21:38.243]  It gets rid of their inhibition.
[02:21:38.623 --> 02:21:47.587]  And it says on the serotonin reuptake inhibitor packaging, may make you commit suicide, may make you go psychotic and engage in mass murder.
[02:21:48.127 --> 02:21:50.949]  It actually says, may make you murder people.
[02:21:52.557 --> 02:21:56.740]  And of course, two days after he's on psychotropics, he's at a psychiatrist.
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:21:58.901]  They took a mentally ill person.
[02:21:58.921 --> 02:21:59.822]  The military's not perfect.
[02:22:00.362 --> 02:22:04.505]  And I really think if somebody has these tendencies, they've got tests, folks.
[02:22:04.545 --> 02:22:06.566]  They know they shouldn't have got this guy in.
[02:22:06.807 --> 02:22:07.787]  He got out of boot camp.
[02:22:08.107 --> 02:22:08.948]  He melted down.
[02:22:09.408 --> 02:22:10.929]  A psychiatrist put him on drugs.
[02:22:11.189 --> 02:22:11.630]  Game over.
[02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:12.530]  That's my view.
[02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:17.414]  We have two survivors, Alex Chadoff and Ali Chandra, who were there.
[02:22:17.994 --> 02:22:22.097]  In the time we've got left and as things develop, I'd like to invite you back on here or some of the other broadcasts.
[02:22:22.717 --> 02:22:33.004]  Second Amendment, what we know about this guy, the background, what else you want to impart to the audience other than, thank God you're alive, and as survivors, what you'd like the world to know.
[02:22:35.246 --> 02:22:38.548]  I mean, I feel like this could have been very preventable.
[02:22:39.829 --> 02:22:47.855]  I mean, we talked a little bit about this before the break, but like literally one person just by the door, or had that had a
[02:22:48.695 --> 02:22:50.296]  A gun on them could have stopped this immediately.
[02:22:50.316 --> 02:22:53.719]  Because, I mean, like, it took six minutes for the sheriffs to arrive.
[02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:57.241]  And in those six minutes, a lot can happen.
[02:22:58.662 --> 02:23:01.844]  And I feel like it just... This could be totally preventable.
[02:23:01.864 --> 02:23:03.025]  That's why it makes me so angry.
[02:23:04.386 --> 02:23:08.849]  And even if it wasn't a security guard, like, somebody was... Yeah, just with a gun.
[02:23:09.310 --> 02:23:10.671]  Like, it was a gun-free zone.
[02:23:12.212 --> 02:23:13.192]  And it was just unsafe.
[02:23:16.252 --> 02:23:19.333]  Ali, I saw you seconding what your boyfriend Alex was saying.
[02:23:19.434 --> 02:23:41.844]  I mean, it's always, like the Pulse nightclub guy, all these people, the psycho who was protected over and over again, in Florida, at Parkland, they had this leftist program where he'd been convicted of all these different crimes, they just let him go, and he was making death threats, he was known as the school shooter, and then he was still allowed to do it, and then the police stood down?
[02:23:41.864 --> 02:23:44.285]  I mean, it's pretty obvious, they target gun-free zones.
[02:23:45.848 --> 02:23:46.689]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:23:46.709 --> 02:23:48.010]  He knew that we were depressed.
[02:23:48.070 --> 02:24:00.242]  He knew that he had the upper hand, and I feel like if there were more places where people knew that people were armed, where, like, a murderer wouldn't want to go there, because he knew he would also be in danger as well.
[02:24:02.093 --> 02:24:07.254]  Well, I'll tell you, when I go to a big movie theater now on a Friday night or something with my family, I feel good when I see a couple cops in there.
[02:24:07.274 --> 02:24:08.714]  And I know they're getting paid $30 an hour.
[02:24:08.974 --> 02:24:09.474]  And that's great.
[02:24:09.494 --> 02:24:10.034]  They're great people.
[02:24:10.054 --> 02:24:10.614]  And they're trained.
[02:24:10.634 --> 02:24:11.295]  They're professional.
[02:24:12.155 --> 02:24:14.295]  99% of the time, they take action when there's a shooter.
[02:24:15.455 --> 02:24:20.676]  But the left and people scared of concealed carries, you never see concealed carry people going and doing a mass murder.
[02:24:20.876 --> 02:24:24.617]  Because by very logic, they go follow the law.
[02:24:24.657 --> 02:24:25.517]  They go take the test.
[02:24:25.777 --> 02:24:26.817]  They want to protect themselves.
[02:24:26.937 --> 02:24:28.858]  Criminals and nuts aren't going to go do that.
[02:24:30.338 --> 02:24:30.838]  Exactly.
[02:24:32.905 --> 02:24:35.509]  People are so scared and saying guns kill people.
[02:24:35.529 --> 02:24:36.691]  It's people kill people.
[02:24:36.751 --> 02:24:37.652]  No, crazy people.
[02:24:37.773 --> 02:24:41.137]  People that like the shooter were out of their minds.
[02:24:42.079 --> 02:24:46.545]  Well, do you ever see my Piers Morgan where I said don't ban guns, ban suicide, mass murder pills?
[02:24:47.745 --> 02:24:48.405]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:24:48.465 --> 02:24:49.185]  I agree with that.
[02:24:49.385 --> 02:24:54.066]  We're going to tag part of that interview on the end of this interview when we upload it to InfoWars.com.
[02:24:54.086 --> 02:24:56.907]  We can't do it on YouTube or anywhere else because we're evil, we're banned.
[02:24:57.767 --> 02:25:10.710]  But just talking to you makes me more upset, though, because like I said, I don't know if you have sisters, Alex, but it's just this thing, obviously, for brothers and fathers and things about their girlfriends, their mothers, their sisters.
[02:25:11.250 --> 02:25:14.111]  I mean, it's just that there's these type of people
[02:25:15.848 --> 02:25:19.231]  One thing that men will kill men for no reason, that's bad, but men that kill women.
[02:25:19.711 --> 02:25:26.256]  Like even the worst gangsters didn't used to kill women, but suddenly all over the world, from Islam to, it's just free reign to kill women.
[02:25:26.476 --> 02:25:27.757]  What the hell happened to men?
[02:25:29.319 --> 02:25:30.159]  Exactly, I don't know.
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:34.102]  Because I mean like, most shooters are men.
[02:25:34.122 --> 02:25:38.045]  Which I think is interesting, but I'm not sure.
[02:25:38.065 --> 02:25:41.088]  I don't know what the, I don't know what will cause them.
[02:25:41.889 --> 02:25:45.370]  Well, he's got a, have you heard of the involuntarily celibate movement?
[02:25:46.551 --> 02:25:51.393]  Everyone so far, this guy's the latest, we don't know yet with him, but now psychiatrists, drugs, you know, that part's been confirmed.
[02:25:51.933 --> 02:25:56.335]  Every one of them's mad that girls wouldn't go out with them because they were creepy or whatever.
[02:25:56.775 --> 02:25:59.997]  And it's not the girl's fault, these dudes are creepy!
[02:26:01.037 --> 02:26:05.099]  I mean, they're probably mentally ill from, you know, genetically, or from the chemicals.
[02:26:05.119 --> 02:26:07.320]  They're all kind of a form of autism is what I'm saying.
[02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:08.620]  Yeah.
[02:26:11.078 --> 02:26:16.042]  I don't know if this guy was suffering from that specifically, but it does make sense.
[02:26:17.503 --> 02:26:28.170]  I mean, like, I know there's things coming out that said that he was bullied and everything like that, but I'm not sure if that's why he did it, or if it was literally that it was insane.
[02:26:28.390 --> 02:26:29.291]  Well, let's think about this.
[02:26:29.371 --> 02:26:31.012]  Millions of people die a year in cars.
[02:26:31.032 --> 02:26:32.373]  Hundreds of thousands in the U.S.
[02:26:32.854 --> 02:26:34.255]  either die or get seriously injured.
[02:26:35.322 --> 02:26:39.184]  We don't say, oh, take cars away, even though it's a deadly weapon.
[02:26:39.344 --> 02:26:50.231]  It's that there's a certain profile of a certain scumbag, and I'm not trying to be mean to white people, but when profile fits, they're mainly white males who are wearing black trench coats that women have refused because they're creepy.
[02:26:50.251 --> 02:26:54.614]  And then they go do this for, I guess, they want to commit suicide and go out with a bang.
[02:26:56.095 --> 02:26:56.495]  Exactly.
[02:26:56.795 --> 02:27:03.159]  And I don't know the mindset and I don't understand the mindset of somebody that can do that.
[02:27:03.968 --> 02:27:05.529]  Especially to just kids.
[02:27:05.649 --> 02:27:06.229]  It was 18 to 23.
[02:27:06.429 --> 02:27:10.171]  He knew that it was young kids.
[02:27:10.852 --> 02:27:13.493]  Every one day he just knew.
[02:27:13.573 --> 02:27:14.974]  It's a selfish thing.
[02:27:15.154 --> 02:27:15.754]  It's a selfish thing.
[02:27:15.794 --> 02:27:22.538]  It's like the fairy tale where Sleeping Beauty the witch isn't invited to the party so she puts the princess into a trance.
[02:27:22.598 --> 02:27:23.758]  I mean it's these people.
[02:27:24.759 --> 02:27:25.419]  It's just scary.
[02:27:25.439 --> 02:27:26.560]  Well I appreciate you both.
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:30.082]  I'm glad you're both alive obviously.
[02:27:30.102 --> 02:27:31.723]  Did you lose any friends or get any friends wounded?
[02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:34.264]  Um, yeah.
[02:27:35.004 --> 02:27:37.565]  Um, people that we knew at the bar.
[02:27:37.865 --> 02:27:39.526]  But, um, yeah.
[02:27:40.366 --> 02:27:41.406]  We love stepping in, too.
[02:27:41.646 --> 02:27:47.448]  Well, if the bar reopens, I hope they have, like, an extra dollar cover charge and put some armed bodyguards in.
[02:27:47.488 --> 02:27:48.308]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:27:48.328 --> 02:27:48.889]  You've got a place for them.
[02:27:49.129 --> 02:27:50.209]  It's a pretty big place, right?
[02:27:50.249 --> 02:27:51.409]  Like, 500, 1,000 people come.
[02:27:51.749 --> 02:27:53.250]  You better have some armed people there, dude.
[02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:58.152]  Yeah, it's actually... The maximum capacity is about 300 people.
[02:27:58.452 --> 02:28:01.093]  Yeah, it's not as big as you think.
[02:28:02.434 --> 02:28:03.795]  It's a large group of people.
[02:28:03.815 --> 02:28:05.376]  Yeah, like there was a lot of people there.
[02:28:05.676 --> 02:28:12.860]  Yeah, if you charge each person an extra dollar cover charge, you could easily, with no cost to the place or no loss, have two armed off-duty police there.
[02:28:13.942 --> 02:28:16.164]  Yeah, no, it's like five dollars to get in on these nights.
[02:28:16.344 --> 02:28:18.085]  Yeah, it's super cheap to get in.
[02:28:18.165 --> 02:28:18.526]  One extra dollar.
[02:28:18.566 --> 02:28:23.850]  Yeah, well, they dropped the ball there because you want cops there anyways because that way there's any problems with bouncers and stuff.
[02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:24.951]  It all gets cleared up.
[02:28:25.031 --> 02:28:25.591]  Very stupid.
[02:28:25.751 --> 02:28:29.114]  Any venue of that size or bigger must have off duty police at it.
[02:28:29.414 --> 02:28:30.715]  It's just, it's a no-brainer.
[02:28:31.496 --> 02:28:34.457]  That way, if there's a police incident, you know, the police already know the cops are there.
[02:28:34.777 --> 02:28:35.697]  Just an absolute no-brainer.
[02:28:35.957 --> 02:28:37.078]  I'm glad you guys are alive.
[02:28:37.758 --> 02:28:38.698]  Obviously, God bless you.
[02:28:38.738 --> 02:28:40.819]  Thanks for coming on and talking about the Second Amendment.
[02:28:41.219 --> 02:28:44.800]  And any new developments, contact the producer and let me get back on, okay?
[02:28:45.861 --> 02:28:46.241]  Absolutely.
[02:28:46.281 --> 02:28:46.861]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:28:47.281 --> 02:28:47.921]  Thank you, guys.

[02:30:02.011 --> 02:30:03.371]  That's because it's been denatured.
[02:30:03.411 --> 02:30:04.292]  It's been watered down.
[02:30:04.352 --> 02:30:05.372]  We didn't do that.
[02:30:07.023 --> 02:30:11.124]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something, but this is the very best I can get?
[02:30:11.544 --> 02:30:13.205]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.

[02:30:28.889 --> 02:30:29.969]  No, you've never seen that, have you?

[02:33:01.974 --> 02:33:16.198]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.939 --> 02:33:25.120]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:25.580 --> 02:33:27.961]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.403 --> 02:33:37.426]  If you're watching us live at Infowars.com, Ford's launch show.
[02:33:38.127 --> 02:33:39.368]  Put that back up, that's incredible.
[02:33:40.368 --> 02:33:46.193]  That is Los Angeles and other areas with a red sun under smoke.
[02:33:47.213 --> 02:33:49.155]  And the fires just get worse and worse.
[02:33:49.195 --> 02:33:50.776]  The fires get more insane.
[02:33:51.717 --> 02:33:54.879]  You know, one way Hollywood gets you to sell out is you don't know you're selling out.
[02:33:56.460 --> 02:34:00.023]  And so, I was in a few movies without even trying to be in them.
[02:34:01.212 --> 02:34:06.573]  And then they wanted me to do all these TV shows, and then they wanted me to, you know, engage in all this activity.
[02:34:07.333 --> 02:34:13.074]  But then it got down to the wire, and it was like, no, you're going to have your own TV show, since you turned down the big national radio show.
[02:34:14.894 --> 02:34:15.795]  Which I did anyways.
[02:34:17.835 --> 02:34:21.036]  But you're not going to talk about the New World Order anymore, and we're going to tell you what to say.
[02:34:21.936 --> 02:34:28.097]  And I'm sitting there with butlers outdoors at a big estate in the middle of the Hollywood Hills.
[02:34:28.956 --> 02:34:32.879]  Famous estate with top Hollywood producers and lawyers.
[02:34:32.919 --> 02:34:33.979]  Like, the top of Hollywood.
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:36.321]  Steven Spielberg wasn't there, but that was about it.
[02:34:37.382 --> 02:34:39.163]  And there's ashes raining down on me.
[02:34:39.863 --> 02:34:42.125]  And I'd been there about a year before, and the same crap was happening.
[02:34:42.145 --> 02:34:45.687]  And I'm looking out over the hills, and about two miles away, there's giant fires.
[02:34:46.147 --> 02:34:47.908]  And ashes are falling in my food.
[02:34:49.129 --> 02:34:50.230]  And I made a decision right there.
[02:34:50.250 --> 02:34:51.411]  I said, this is a waste of time.
[02:34:51.431 --> 02:34:52.952]  I'm not going to do what they want anyways.
[02:34:53.292 --> 02:34:54.072]  Now they've been clear.
[02:34:54.273 --> 02:34:55.193]  I'm never coming back here.
[02:34:55.894 --> 02:34:57.755]  And I've been back once to be on Joe Rogan's show.
[02:34:59.079 --> 02:35:01.903]  Then once I went to Southern California to do a speech, then I drove up to L.A.
[02:35:01.943 --> 02:35:04.447]  and about two years ago and regretted that as well.
[02:35:04.667 --> 02:35:09.475]  It turned into a fiasco, but it's like hell on earth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:10.839 --> 02:35:12.800]  And that's what wants to run America and run the world.
[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:16.140]  And the whole thing is collapsing into the rest of the U.S.
[02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:18.541]  and we accept the poison when it gets there.
[02:35:18.561 --> 02:35:23.703]  I'm going to put t-shirts out that say, don't California my Texas, or don't California my America.
[02:35:24.383 --> 02:35:25.523]  Because it's got to be done.
[02:35:25.543 --> 02:35:28.884]  A lot of Californians are great people, but the ones leaving seem to be the worst.
[02:35:28.904 --> 02:35:30.604]  So I'm going to stop right there.
[02:35:31.265 --> 02:35:32.965]  Just briefly, because we won't be here if we don't plug.
[02:35:35.006 --> 02:35:39.987]  We had the biggest sale we've ever had because they're trying to take our payment processors and shut us down, as you see on the news.
[02:35:41.598 --> 02:35:44.019]  They took five of our six processors, we were down to one.
[02:35:44.699 --> 02:35:47.520]  I got some backups and got contracts now, but you never know.
[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:54.481]  And the harassment is just intensifying by Soros, it's in the news, and we just covered it last hour.
[02:35:55.942 --> 02:36:00.703]  So I needed to sell out all the Christmas stock, the Black Friday stock.
[02:36:02.244 --> 02:36:03.784]  Three sales stock, I wanted to sell it out.
[02:36:04.364 --> 02:36:07.265]  And the sale was so good, we sold a lot of the stock.
[02:36:08.695 --> 02:36:09.755]  Then I said, well, get rid of the sale.
[02:36:09.895 --> 02:36:10.616]  Get rid of the sale.
[02:36:10.696 --> 02:36:16.398]  And I mean, sales went to where, you know, we will not be here in six months, a year at the current sales rate.
[02:36:16.438 --> 02:36:18.198]  So it's a catch 22.
[02:36:18.258 --> 02:36:23.360]  I sold a ton of stock, but didn't make a ton of money off of it to fund the operation and to try to expand.
[02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:25.001]  If you're not expanding, you're contracting.
[02:36:25.041 --> 02:36:29.402]  So when I talk about this, folks, who's under attack like us?
[02:36:29.462 --> 02:36:29.702]  Trump.
[02:36:29.822 --> 02:36:30.223]  And that's it.
[02:36:31.043 --> 02:36:36.525]  And it's because this audience and this, this show built the launch pad and launched
[02:36:37.915 --> 02:36:40.237]  The new renaissance, the 1776 option.
[02:36:40.958 --> 02:36:43.320]  And it was all because I believed in the people.
[02:36:44.561 --> 02:36:58.872]  And I believed that if you're going to have this worldwide tyranny based on austerity and based on the end of the family and the end of human-based systems, that if we promoted the greatest expression of human will and goodness, the renaissance,
[02:37:00.165 --> 02:37:05.286]  And if we relaunch that, people would choose that over the tyranny of the New World Order.
[02:37:05.986 --> 02:37:17.908]  It was not a really hard equation, but we worked hard, we did it, we got probably 8-9 billion views total on YouTube, billions on Facebook, hundreds of radio stations across the country.
[02:37:18.588 --> 02:37:20.789]  UKIP helped get launched in its modern form by us.
[02:37:21.849 --> 02:37:26.090]  The head of UKIP said that, the founder said, no, literally half our base is you, thank you.
[02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:27.670]  It's not bragging, it's saying,
[02:37:28.712 --> 02:37:34.276]  We were the right people at the right time when the internet developed and the enemy was arrogant to tell what was happening.
[02:37:34.516 --> 02:37:37.598]  So now globalism, new world order, one world government, that's a household word.
[02:37:38.158 --> 02:37:40.840]  People know what's happening and all the world nationalists are winning.
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:48.464]  But now we're slated for destruction because you and I, all of us together, the Enforced family, you relaunched what's happening now.
[02:37:49.525 --> 02:37:50.385]  This is epic.
[02:37:51.226 --> 02:37:52.467]  But now we're slated for destruction.
[02:37:53.607 --> 02:37:54.128]  And that's why
[02:37:55.745 --> 02:38:00.228]  If a larger portion of the audience would just go get some t-shirts or get some great supplements, they're already amazing.
[02:38:00.448 --> 02:38:01.048]  They're already great.
[02:38:01.388 --> 02:38:03.710]  I can't discount everything because a bunch of stuff's almost sold out.
[02:38:04.170 --> 02:38:07.792]  A bunch of stuff that did come in that we have enough of, I can give you 67% off the Silver Bullet.
[02:38:07.812 --> 02:38:09.413]  I make like $3 on that.
[02:38:12.943 --> 02:38:14.444]  The X3 is way better than X2.
[02:38:14.684 --> 02:38:15.685]  It's all three types of iodine.
[02:38:15.745 --> 02:38:16.385]  It's the next level.
[02:38:17.186 --> 02:38:17.826]  50% off free shipping.
[02:38:17.846 --> 02:38:18.887]  I make like $10 on that.
[02:38:19.207 --> 02:38:20.908]  I need to have funding.
[02:38:21.209 --> 02:38:22.430]  57% off super metals for fuel vitality.
[02:38:22.690 --> 02:38:26.773]  That's so expensive to make because it's cold-pressed and it really works well for libido, stamina, energy.
[02:38:26.813 --> 02:38:27.753]  I just can't deal with it, though.
[02:38:27.773 --> 02:38:29.615]  Because I can go with a pill for them.
[02:38:29.635 --> 02:38:30.575]  It's three times stronger.
[02:38:30.836 --> 02:38:32.317]  It's not cold-pressed, but it has the same effect.
[02:38:32.517 --> 02:38:33.177]  It costs me less.
[02:38:33.197 --> 02:38:34.178]  That's what we're going to have for you.
[02:38:34.718 --> 02:38:35.559]  I have to operate.
[02:38:35.599 --> 02:38:36.340]  I have to fund things.
[02:38:37.284 --> 02:38:41.886]  I don't think it's lowering of quality, it's just that it's so esoteric and weird to do that I'm just done with it.
[02:38:42.367 --> 02:38:43.647]  People love it and it works great.
[02:38:44.008 --> 02:38:44.928]  This is the end of that.
[02:38:45.268 --> 02:38:46.809]  It's 57% off.
[02:38:47.249 --> 02:38:51.652]  I've got to get it out of here so I've got six months of funding in case they shut me down.
[02:38:51.892 --> 02:38:57.435]  They got CNN trucks driving around and we went and found out who, obviously we got the plates checked.
[02:38:58.355 --> 02:39:00.476]  I don't know what they're planning, but it ain't good, okay?
[02:39:01.016 --> 02:39:03.117]  When I leave here, there'll be two chase cars following me.
[02:39:03.137 --> 02:39:04.137]  I don't know what the hell's going on.
[02:39:04.397 --> 02:39:05.438]  Sometimes helicopters.
[02:39:05.918 --> 02:39:09.159]  So, the point is, is that we need to get funds in right now.
[02:39:09.419 --> 02:39:10.200]  These are great products.
[02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:10.540]  You need them.
[02:39:10.580 --> 02:39:11.220]  Get a t-shirt.
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:11.700]  Get a book.
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:12.761]  Get a water filter.
[02:39:12.801 --> 02:39:14.081]  Alexa Pure is the best deal ever.
[02:39:14.581 --> 02:39:15.502]  InfowarsTour.com.
[02:39:15.582 --> 02:39:15.822]  Okay.
[02:39:16.642 --> 02:39:18.263]  I could have our next guest on for ten hours.
[02:39:18.923 --> 02:39:21.884]  And we'll do three minutes here, ten minutes, and then five minutes the next hour.
[02:39:22.324 --> 02:39:24.725]  And then Nick Baggish is taking over, and I'm not going to cut into his time.
[02:39:25.265 --> 02:39:26.986]  But I just want to introduce this guy to people because
[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:36.925]  I hardly ever look at YouTube anymore, but I wanted to go see if one of the videos I had done was on there so we can link to that and drive up the algorithm and, you know, try to get it out to people.
[02:39:38.066 --> 02:39:44.930]  And so I was searching my gay frog satire video, and it just popped up in my feed, the Black Pilled.
[02:39:45.231 --> 02:39:46.852]  That's blackpilled.com, but it popped up.
[02:39:47.312 --> 02:39:51.194]  So I watched like five of the videos, and I ended up airing some of them last Saturday.
[02:39:53.700 --> 02:40:02.126]  The guy has a way with words, the way he laid things out, the way that by the end of the video, I knew where he was going to be going, and it was that, you know, real experience where...
[02:40:04.517 --> 02:40:05.317]  We're reading C.S.
[02:40:05.378 --> 02:40:10.320]  Lewis or something, or just a good writer, where you don't know what he's talking about at first, but by the middle you get a good idea.
[02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:12.662]  By the end, you're totally synced with his thinking.
[02:40:13.042 --> 02:40:17.104]  It's not just that you're synced, it's because he's synced with the truth, and you recognize it by the end.
[02:40:17.565 --> 02:40:18.946]  And so I don't know where to start with him.
[02:40:18.986 --> 02:40:20.106]  I want to introduce him to the audience.
[02:40:20.546 --> 02:40:21.947]  I want to get him on as a routine guest.
[02:40:22.648 --> 02:40:23.628]  I just want to get his take.
[02:40:23.688 --> 02:40:26.650]  We haven't talked before he came on about where he sees the world right now.
[02:40:27.210 --> 02:40:30.272]  And I almost didn't even want to get him on, because, you know, we give somebody extra attention.
[02:40:30.292 --> 02:40:31.113]  He's already very popular.
[02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:33.370]  50, 60, 100 million views.
[02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:33.811]  I don't know.
[02:40:33.831 --> 02:40:36.092]  150,000 subscribers on YouTube.
[02:40:36.992 --> 02:40:37.672]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:40:37.712 --> 02:40:38.813]  We can't be shrieking violence.
[02:40:38.833 --> 02:40:41.234]  We've got to give attention to what is really good.
[02:40:41.274 --> 02:40:46.936]  Like Tucker Carlson I see as being very strong, very pure, very clean, very truthful, very special.
[02:40:47.316 --> 02:40:50.037]  And I think that blackpill.com is as well.
[02:40:50.557 --> 02:40:53.498]  And so joining us is Devon Stack.
[02:40:53.538 --> 02:40:55.079]  Devon, great job with your videos.
[02:40:55.159 --> 02:40:56.119]  I am really addicted.
[02:40:56.199 --> 02:40:57.280]  So we salute you, my friend.
[02:40:58.607 --> 02:41:00.008]  Oh, thanks for having me.
[02:41:00.408 --> 02:41:01.469]  And it's Devin.
[02:41:03.371 --> 02:41:05.552]  See, I'm teleprompter free, so we'll start over.
[02:41:05.892 --> 02:41:08.514]  It's Devin Stack joining us.
[02:41:08.554 --> 02:41:10.836]  So I saw your stuff this weekend.
[02:41:10.856 --> 02:41:13.018]  I know you've been around for years, but really impressive stuff.
[02:41:14.379 --> 02:41:14.759]  Oh, thanks.
[02:41:15.019 --> 02:41:15.239]  Thanks.
[02:41:15.279 --> 02:41:19.823]  Yeah, I've been doing videos since before the election.
[02:41:20.583 --> 02:41:25.787]  I was really trying to make sure Hillary didn't get into office like a lot of people, I think, on the right.
[02:41:26.717 --> 02:41:28.837]  And, uh, you know, we succeeded at that.
[02:41:29.218 --> 02:41:35.239]  And now I'm trying to go further and kind of, uh, really analyze that.
[02:41:35.859 --> 02:41:45.841]  I think the average person doesn't have a good window into the minds of a lot of these sociopaths that are in the ruling class because they, I mean, the average person's not a sociopath.
[02:41:46.681 --> 02:41:55.923]  Um, and a lot of people also have a hard time spotting the propaganda that kind of permeates and saturates all the, uh,
[02:41:56.845 --> 02:42:03.587]  Uh, stuff coming out of Hollywood and, and, uh, well, and even places you wouldn't expect, you know, in advertisements even.
[02:42:04.448 --> 02:42:10.690]  And so I like to, uh, try to dissect, you know, whether it's movies and, you know, films that go back.
[02:42:10.990 --> 02:42:15.251]  I did a video recently where they're promoting divorce in the 1960s.
[02:42:15.311 --> 02:42:17.752]  So a lot of people don't realize how far back this goes.
[02:42:18.490 --> 02:42:23.794]  So, just trying to do my part in trying to preserve Western civilization.
[02:42:23.814 --> 02:42:27.116]  I feel like, in a lot of ways, we're on the last legs.
[02:42:27.796 --> 02:42:35.501]  And if we don't get this, if we don't wake people up and get this fixed soon, there's not going to be anything left to preserve.
[02:42:37.382 --> 02:42:41.225]  I totally agree with you, but I want to talk to you about you because you're interesting, Mr. Stack.
[02:42:41.925 --> 02:42:43.406]  David Stacks here with us at BlackPill.com.
[02:42:45.098 --> 02:42:46.962]  Because I watch five of your videos Saturday.
[02:42:47.002 --> 02:42:48.385]  I watch six or seven more since then.
[02:42:48.405 --> 02:42:49.487]  I've had my children watch them.
[02:42:49.968 --> 02:42:51.751]  And I just think you're doing something special.
[02:42:52.192 --> 02:42:55.078]  And I want to recognize that in front of everybody right now.
[02:42:55.098 --> 02:42:56.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:01.127 --> 02:43:10.409]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[02:43:10.889 --> 02:43:21.912]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[02:43:22.612 --> 02:43:28.716]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee bean.
[02:43:28.776 --> 02:43:38.222]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions, Patriot Blend coffees have a smooth, bold flavor with great depth.
[02:43:38.602 --> 02:43:42.265]  I can't believe there's so many traitors and pieces of crap in this country that actively
[02:44:06.024 --> 02:44:10.307]  ...have an inferiority complex with the Republic, and a spiritual hatred of it.
[02:44:10.647 --> 02:44:11.388]  And it's spiritual!
[02:44:12.308 --> 02:44:31.422]  Because they will go out of their way to destroy this country and their own future, because they have some existential envy that they have to act out, working with the worst, most murderous, radical Islam, Orthodox Islam, the Chai Koms, Juncker, and it's like Juncker's the heir to the top Nazis and has all the stolen wealth.
[02:44:32.202 --> 02:44:41.873]  Soros is, and it's like, it's so crazy that everyone we're fighting are like super villains, and their whole histories are pure evil, and then the good guys are under attack!
[02:44:42.013 --> 02:44:42.874]  Let me explain something.
[02:44:43.095 --> 02:44:46.018]  I don't feel sorry for myself being lied about and demonized.
[02:44:46.158 --> 02:44:46.959]  I know I'm in a war.
[02:44:47.099 --> 02:44:50.881]  And I feel good to see America waking up and coming back from the dead to a certain extent.
[02:44:50.921 --> 02:44:54.344]  But you know, people should be way more active and way more aggressive.
[02:44:54.464 --> 02:44:56.105]  Because this is serious, folks.
[02:44:56.125 --> 02:45:00.728]  I mean, we're fighting people as bad as Hitler and Stalin and Mao combined.
[02:45:00.888 --> 02:45:02.549]  I mean, they are really wicked.
[02:45:02.669 --> 02:45:04.850]  And they are doing horrible things to our genetics.
[02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:06.271]  They're doing horrible things to our environment.
[02:45:06.471 --> 02:45:11.194]  The things the globalists are up to are so out of control and so bad it makes the head spin.
[02:45:11.294 --> 02:45:13.876]  And it just makes me sad to see America in this position.
[02:45:13.976 --> 02:45:14.897]  Again, it's mixed feelings.
[02:45:14.957 --> 02:45:15.838]  Good things are happening.
[02:45:15.898 --> 02:45:16.959]  We're coming back from the dead.
[02:45:17.019 --> 02:45:25.288]  But still, it's so cut and dry that people fighting against this country, people fighting against the reassurgence of our republic, are not Americans.
[02:45:25.568 --> 02:45:26.469]  They're globalists.
[02:45:26.609 --> 02:45:28.051]  They want to overthrow the country.
[02:45:28.151 --> 02:45:30.694]  They're allied with the most murderous regimes in history.
[02:45:30.894 --> 02:45:34.298]  And they know they're involved in a conquering operation.
[02:45:34.778 --> 02:45:35.779]  Cut and it's dry!
[02:45:35.939 --> 02:45:37.520]  I mean, where are your instincts?
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:38.841]  Where is your common sense?
[02:45:38.881 --> 02:45:41.763]  We have to stop going along with the globalists and their minions.
[02:45:41.823 --> 02:45:46.026]  And we have to stop trying to placate them and be friends with them and sit here and play nice.
[02:45:46.106 --> 02:45:47.366]  They're not playing nice.
[02:45:47.947 --> 02:45:50.388]  They're a bunch of bullying, evil jerks.
[02:45:50.749 --> 02:45:56.633]  And they now know that InfoWars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[02:45:56.793 --> 02:45:58.874]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[02:45:58.994 --> 02:46:00.455]  Because to them, we are death.
[02:46:00.775 --> 02:46:04.578]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, and to Barack Obama, and to Ward Rothschild,
[02:46:04.898 --> 02:46:07.439]  You understand, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:09.540]  Come to their door.
[02:46:10.081 --> 02:46:11.481]  I'm death, and they know it.
[02:46:11.641 --> 02:46:13.883]  I'm death of their system, and you're death to them.
[02:46:13.963 --> 02:46:16.364]  We really just love life, but see, to them, we're death.
[02:46:16.464 --> 02:46:25.768]  And if we won't stand against these possessed people, then we deserve to be enslaved by them, and God will hold us in judgment for allowing them to endanger the innocent and the children.
[02:46:25.868 --> 02:46:32.872]  So I tell you now, those of you that have stood idly by, your soul, your immortal soul, is on the line.
[02:46:33.072 --> 02:46:40.156]  And if you don't stand for the unborn, and if you don't stand for the innocent, and if you don't stand against these monsters, you stand before God.
[02:46:40.216 --> 02:46:42.517]  God will say, I know you not.
[02:46:42.537 --> 02:46:43.638]  You didn't do anything.
[02:46:44.458 --> 02:46:47.740]  But the Holy Spirit touched you to fight these people, and you were of the devil.
[02:46:48.580 --> 02:46:50.661]  So go back from which you came forever.
[02:46:51.682 --> 02:46:53.423]  You are not amongst us.
[02:47:01.903 --> 02:47:04.644]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:20.188 --> 02:47:26.770]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:34.717 --> 02:47:38.309]  Yes, I'm a little dancer She came a-dancin' to my home
[02:47:39.312 --> 02:47:40.753]  QAnon and BitConnect.
[02:47:40.793 --> 02:47:44.655]  That was one of the videos he did I watched last Saturday.
[02:47:45.375 --> 02:47:46.576]  It's BlackPilled.com.
[02:47:46.596 --> 02:47:54.400]  The site is down to the massive traffic, which is why I say we should put up the YouTube channel, BlackPilled, so people can find that.
[02:47:55.081 --> 02:47:58.782]  Going back here to Devin Stack of BlackPilled.com.
[02:47:59.323 --> 02:48:02.444]  Devin, you're a humble guy, but your videos are all out of the park.
[02:48:02.625 --> 02:48:05.466]  Not just the sentimentography, not just the way you do the graphics.
[02:48:05.846 --> 02:48:06.647]  What you say
[02:48:07.367 --> 02:48:16.794]  Is just, I watched now probably 10 of the videos, and I couldn't find any fault, and you were able to do things subtly that I kind of do like a bull in a china shop.
[02:48:17.134 --> 02:48:31.766]  So let's start with QAnon and BitConnect, because I'm not going to get into inside baseball, but I've been offered a million dollars a month, $500,000 a month, you name it, which would actually fund us and help us and fix the problems we have.
[02:48:32.844 --> 02:48:36.505]  But it was always, I thought, a pump and dump for different companies and different groups.
[02:48:36.565 --> 02:48:38.666]  And obviously I was approached by BitConnect people.
[02:48:38.706 --> 02:48:42.568]  And I just said, listen, I've never gotten involved in when Max Keiser gave me a bunch of Bitcoin.
[02:48:42.948 --> 02:48:45.009]  I believe in cryptocurrency.
[02:48:45.309 --> 02:48:46.189]  I know it's the future.
[02:48:46.249 --> 02:48:48.330]  I know the Federal Reserve is already its own fake currency.
[02:48:48.650 --> 02:48:50.471]  So I don't have a digital thing we all agree on.
[02:48:50.511 --> 02:48:54.532]  I get tally sticks and, you know, 800 years ago in the history of money and all the rest of it.
[02:48:54.872 --> 02:48:55.873]  And the private Federal Reserve.
[02:48:56.573 --> 02:49:01.815]  But then when it's like it's this secret bot that's loving and just keep your money in here, I was like Ponzi scheme, I'm not doing it.
[02:49:02.595 --> 02:49:04.876]  People are like, listen, just take the money.
[02:49:05.437 --> 02:49:07.257]  So I don't talk to any of these people.
[02:49:07.337 --> 02:49:07.878]  I don't do it.
[02:49:07.938 --> 02:49:10.259]  Some of the networks I've been on have taken some of these ads.
[02:49:10.299 --> 02:49:11.540]  And I said, I'm leaving if you do that.
[02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:16.822]  Because I just, I'll tell people to buy great vitamins or minerals or water filters.
[02:49:16.882 --> 02:49:19.443]  I know they work damn well and it funds our operation and I'm using them.
[02:49:20.364 --> 02:49:26.707]  But I can't walk somebody into something that I'm not sure I'd give to my kids.
[02:49:27.127 --> 02:49:30.009]  I just, it's like Tony Montana says, no lemon, no kids.
[02:49:31.140 --> 02:49:33.625]  I'll kill them, but no women, no kids.
[02:49:33.665 --> 02:49:37.093]  It's like, I've got rules here, and other people don't.
[02:49:37.133 --> 02:49:39.018]  You laid it out so beautifully in that video show.
[02:49:39.855 --> 02:49:41.016]  Because I'll take over, as you know.
[02:49:41.176 --> 02:49:41.837]  You've got the floor.
[02:49:41.897 --> 02:49:42.597]  Talk about that.
[02:49:42.677 --> 02:49:43.478]  Talk about QAnon.
[02:49:43.558 --> 02:49:46.160]  Because you just put that last video out a few weeks ago, I saw.
[02:49:46.601 --> 02:49:47.761]  Man, the Sessions thing.
[02:49:47.781 --> 02:49:50.464]  Does that not put the cherry on top of what you shed?
[02:49:50.524 --> 02:49:52.405]  And then QAnon saying, I'm going to be arrested.
[02:49:52.966 --> 02:49:54.147]  I'm this evil person.
[02:49:54.167 --> 02:49:57.449]  I mean, that is, I can tell you, that's pure horseman-er, obviously.
[02:49:57.509 --> 02:50:06.177]  So you really did the best job, I thought, subtly with QAnon by exposing BitConnect and just saying, oh, I'm going to now cover QAnon.
[02:50:06.977 --> 02:50:07.778]  But I guess I just did.
[02:50:09.355 --> 02:50:29.817]  Yeah, well I think the biggest concern I had when QAnon first popped up on the scene, I noticed a lot of people talking about him, and it wasn't so much that I disagreed with everything QAnon was saying, my fear was, just like with BitConnect, so BitConnect as you described it, it was basically a Ponzi scheme.
[02:50:30.715 --> 02:50:41.907]  And when a lot of people invested their money into BitConnect and then it ended up like every Ponzi scheme and eventually failed, it turned a lot of people off to cryptocurrency just in general.
[02:50:42.367 --> 02:50:48.634]  So it was just, it was really the only people that ended up benefiting were the, you know, the people at the top of the pyramid scheme.
[02:50:49.194 --> 02:50:56.499]  And it really hurt the market and of course it imploded right around the same time the whole market bubble popped and it was a huge mess.
[02:50:56.559 --> 02:51:07.567]  And so my fear was that we were going to basically see the same kind of a thing with QAnon where people were going to put their hopes and dreams into this anonymous poster.
[02:51:08.474 --> 02:51:18.844]  And then if a day ever came, like, I don't know, like the other day when Sessions got fired, where it became pretty obvious that this was all a hoax...
[02:51:19.745 --> 02:51:24.448]  Then they would all of a sudden disregard everything, all the research they may have done.
[02:51:24.468 --> 02:51:28.571]  They might think, oh, well, if this was a lie, then it's all a lie.
[02:51:28.591 --> 02:51:32.834]  I'm going to go right back to watching CNN and MSNBC.
[02:51:33.414 --> 02:51:36.817]  And it was going to actually do more damage than good.
[02:51:36.857 --> 02:51:42.040]  I think whoever came up with it, maybe, I don't know, their initial intentions might have been good.
[02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:42.701]  I know they are.
[02:51:42.721 --> 02:51:43.701]  Let's try to get people.
[02:51:44.302 --> 02:51:46.343]  And yeah, there's that microchip guy.
[02:51:46.383 --> 02:51:48.485]  And I don't know 100% who's running it now.
[02:51:49.252 --> 02:51:56.375]  It's like, it's kind of like, it's doing more damage than good now, and it just seemed like enough was enough.
[02:51:57.476 --> 02:52:01.777]  And so I had to make that metaphor, or use the parable, really.
[02:52:01.797 --> 02:52:08.800]  Here's what happened with BitConnect, and this is what's going to happen when QAnon collapses.
[02:52:08.940 --> 02:52:10.661]  And honestly, I've seen a lot of that already.
[02:52:10.681 --> 02:52:12.542]  I've seen people who are losing hope.
[02:52:13.075 --> 02:52:24.242]  Who are, you know, despite my name, I'm not completely black-pilled about the future, but there are people that are really black-pilled now because of their experience with QAnon.
[02:52:24.302 --> 02:52:25.984]  Yeah, where'd you get the term black-pilled?
[02:52:26.024 --> 02:52:26.484]  What's that mean?
[02:52:27.469 --> 02:52:42.893]  So, blackpilled, it means different things to different people, but pretty much it means, like, redpilled, well, let me put it this way, blackpilled is like you've had too many redpills, where it just, it seems like it's a little overwhelming, it's a little too much, and... So I think it's fair to say I've been blackpilled.
[02:52:44.174 --> 02:52:44.394]  Right.
[02:52:45.094 --> 02:52:49.455]  Well, yeah, and honestly, you know, I'm not blackpilled in terms of
[02:52:50.191 --> 02:53:01.927]  There's no possible way for a future for me and my children, but I'm definitely blackmailed in terms of I don't see America ever really at least not on its current track.
[02:53:01.947 --> 02:53:02.668]  I totally agree.
[02:53:02.728 --> 02:53:03.429]  I totally agree.
[02:53:03.489 --> 02:53:04.550]  Unless people break.
[02:53:05.111 --> 02:53:12.337]  With a psychic political virus that the globalists and Wikileaks admit is meant to bring us down, destroy us, and steal our prosperity.
[02:53:12.358 --> 02:53:18.283]  Because the globalists don't want the general public demanding prosperity, which we could have into a thousand star systems immediately.
[02:53:18.803 --> 02:53:22.887]  They want to psychically and politically poison us, so we roll over and die.
[02:53:22.967 --> 02:53:27.551]  So, I agree, unless people can... It's so obvious when you know this, that you're right.
[02:53:27.831 --> 02:53:29.072]  It's a very bleak future.
[02:53:30.202 --> 02:53:32.925]  And then you see Trump like this flamethrower of truth.
[02:53:33.345 --> 02:53:38.071]  Once you know all this stuff, you know what he's doing, and it's like, God, they're not taking their lifeboats!
[02:53:38.751 --> 02:53:40.273]  It's like so obvious!
[02:53:40.293 --> 02:53:40.974]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:53:41.943 --> 02:53:43.483]  No, you're right.
[02:53:43.703 --> 02:53:49.565]  The problem is, there's really, what we need is, we need to have something that brings everyone together.
[02:53:49.785 --> 02:53:54.246]  The problem with the right right now is, and there's some benefits to this.
[02:53:54.926 --> 02:54:02.848]  The left is creating division, so we have to use division to counter, because that's how the primitive programming works, and Trump wants to get out of that process.
[02:54:02.888 --> 02:54:07.709]  He said that, but what is he supposed to do when people are so dumb, they're using primitive programming on people?
[02:54:08.229 --> 02:54:11.331]  He goes, yes, we're all together, but they're being racist, so primitives come together.
[02:54:11.371 --> 02:54:12.131]  What is he supposed to do?
[02:54:13.532 --> 02:54:22.136]  Well, I just think, I think the right in general needs to focus maybe somewhat on in real life activism.
[02:54:22.616 --> 02:54:22.956]  I agree.
[02:54:22.976 --> 02:54:27.078]  The problem is the left has... The right wing needs to engage in a third dimension invasion.
[02:54:28.277 --> 02:54:30.759]  Well, and we need, we need, honestly we need funding.
[02:54:30.799 --> 02:54:37.125]  A lot of it's tough because they've got George Soros and quite frankly the right threatens billionaires.
[02:54:37.165 --> 02:54:39.367]  So what billionaire is going to want to fund a movement?
[02:54:39.387 --> 02:54:44.171]  Because he feels like he's part of the establishment even though he will be destroyed by the system.
[02:54:44.531 --> 02:54:47.734]  He wants 15 Ferraris instead of stepping into the game.
[02:54:47.774 --> 02:54:49.455]  He got there by playing it safe.
[02:54:49.956 --> 02:54:54.700]  So he's going to go, oh yeah, I'm glad Alex Jones or Blackfield's there, but they're not really committed.
[02:54:56.243 --> 02:54:57.004]  Yeah, there's not enough.
[02:54:57.144 --> 02:55:04.388]  There's not enough people on the right that I mean, there's obviously the the usual suspects that are going to fund the neocon type stuff.
[02:55:04.448 --> 02:55:13.554]  But there's no one on the right that really wants to have any kind of a libertarian style America that that's funding us.
[02:55:13.654 --> 02:55:16.796]  That's not very controlled, you know.
[02:55:17.097 --> 02:55:23.281]  And that's the thing, too, is once you accept the money, now all of a sudden you have to accept whatever platform.
[02:55:23.301 --> 02:55:25.202]  There's no one that's that's willing to just
[02:55:26.148 --> 02:55:32.053]  Fund organizations and and and help us Exist so it's really it's tough.
[02:55:32.093 --> 02:55:33.274]  It's tough as a youtuber.
[02:55:33.434 --> 02:55:44.843]  You know and be clear somebody like Matt Drudge was one of the biggest sites in the world You know traffic is is is funding show He's there Trump's there behind the scenes.
[02:55:45.364 --> 02:55:50.468]  There are some groups, but you're right the Mercer's that the cokes their establishment It's all control paradigm crap
[02:55:51.837 --> 02:55:53.978]  Well, and they're demonetizing.
[02:55:53.998 --> 02:55:57.978]  You know, they demonetize, I'd say, at least about 80% of my videos.
[02:55:59.499 --> 02:56:03.240]  I do have some Patreon people, and that's really helpful.
[02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:10.842]  And in a way, it's good, because it's going to force people on the right to kind of be more creative and explore other options.
[02:56:11.102 --> 02:56:15.043]  Yeah, well, you're saying you're willing to work your ass off and reach millions of people.
[02:56:15.563 --> 02:56:20.844]  You just need to have your uniform and your information warfare weapon and food in your backpack.
[02:56:22.088 --> 02:56:23.009]  Right, right.
[02:56:23.330 --> 02:56:31.882]  And the cool thing is though, in a way though, it's forcing us to be better, while at the same time it's making the left lazy and stupid.
[02:56:32.563 --> 02:56:36.388]  Because they don't have to work within these constraints.
[02:56:37.210 --> 02:56:39.271]  No, it's very Nietzschean.
[02:56:39.311 --> 02:56:40.492]  Here's the deal.
[02:56:40.872 --> 02:56:42.693]  They made a calculation to ban me.
[02:56:42.873 --> 02:56:44.394]  It only made us bigger in many ways.
[02:56:44.835 --> 02:56:47.696]  Little people banning them destroys them because they think they're done.
[02:56:47.736 --> 02:56:48.677]  They don't do their own thing.
[02:56:48.697 --> 02:56:49.577]  It makes them stronger, actually.
[02:56:49.938 --> 02:56:53.240]  But because we know that rule, they are really freaking out right now.
[02:56:53.260 --> 02:56:54.140]  But I agree with what you're saying.
[02:56:55.141 --> 02:57:04.026]  Well, and another thing that I don't think they've really taken into consideration is if there's anything that brings people together, it's persecution.
[02:57:05.115 --> 02:57:17.523]  And the censorship that you've experienced, probably one of the most extreme cases right now, but the censorship that's pretty much, I mean, it's far and wide on the right.
[02:57:18.403 --> 02:57:27.249]  I've had video, they recently sent me an email, I forget which video it is off the top of my head, but they said, this doesn't violate our terms of service.
[02:57:28.215 --> 02:57:32.697]  Uh, or our guidelines, but we're going to age-restrict it anyway, because we want to.
[02:57:32.837 --> 02:57:38.760]  Like, they literally say in the email, it doesn't, uh, violate our terms of service.
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:44.782]  They've gone from acting with us like, oh, there's this reason or that, now they just go, you're gone.
[02:57:45.482 --> 02:57:46.663]  Because we challenge these people.
[02:57:48.331 --> 02:57:52.192]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.

[02:58:54.936 --> 02:59:00.260]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:59:00.340 --> 02:59:03.082]  But the globalists now want to target
[02:59:04.187 --> 02:59:08.069]  Where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:08.329 --> 02:59:10.790]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:11.430 --> 02:59:12.291]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:12.311 --> 02:59:16.633]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:16.693 --> 02:59:18.674]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:19.654 --> 02:59:20.594]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:20.734 --> 02:59:21.535]  I've prayed for that.
[02:59:22.095 --> 02:59:23.715]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:23.735 --> 02:59:26.737]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:27.617 --> 02:59:30.058]  I will give the total sacrifice.
[02:59:30.638 --> 02:59:31.758]  I will never falter.
[02:59:32.318 --> 02:59:34.379]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:34.659 --> 02:59:35.359]  I physically will.
[02:59:35.800 --> 02:59:42.562]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at FullMoreStore.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:50.788 --> 02:59:54.891]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:55.411 --> 02:59:56.752]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:58.213 --> 03:00:01.395]  Oh, the girl can't help it!
[03:00:22.280 --> 03:00:23.641]  She ain't doing nothing wrong.
[03:00:23.681 --> 03:00:25.581]  She's the goddess.
[03:00:25.621 --> 03:00:27.782]  But don't say mother or father.
[03:00:27.822 --> 03:00:33.204]  Don't say woman to some guy that identifies as a woman.
[03:00:33.344 --> 03:00:34.505]  It's angered by that.
[03:00:48.872 --> 03:00:50.114]  What type of cult's telling us that?
[03:00:50.794 --> 03:00:51.175]  Men.
[03:00:51.415 --> 03:00:51.735]  Women.
[03:00:52.296 --> 03:00:53.317]  That's our species.
[03:00:53.658 --> 03:00:54.459]  That's our journey.
[03:00:54.759 --> 03:00:56.100]  For all these eons together.
[03:00:57.302 --> 03:00:58.884]  You don't really think we started off here, do you?
[03:00:58.904 --> 03:01:03.249]  That's hilarious.
[03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:05.872]  Oh, the girl can't help it!
[03:01:07.025 --> 03:01:07.866]  She's American.
[03:01:07.926 --> 03:01:08.727]  She's the world.
[03:01:08.747 --> 03:01:10.048]  She is the humans.
[03:01:10.148 --> 03:01:12.371]  Women are everything.
[03:01:12.952 --> 03:01:15.715]  Men are the machines women send out.
[03:01:16.355 --> 03:01:19.779]  I'm an expression of the women.
[03:01:19.819 --> 03:01:22.482]  This is woman's idea of fighting the tyranny.
[03:01:23.203 --> 03:01:26.106]  That's what it is.
[03:01:26.206 --> 03:01:27.288]  Lord have mercy.
[03:01:28.564 --> 03:01:35.331]  All right, let's go back for this segment and the next, and then Nick Baggage, the guy that exposed all the big secret tech and everything, totally vindicated, has taken over.
[03:01:35.711 --> 03:01:37.213]  Rob Deuce coming in real briefly, though.
[03:01:37.694 --> 03:01:41.377]  Huge news on this Florida fraud, the hacking, the scams.
[03:01:41.918 --> 03:01:43.399]  I mean, this is a real war we're in.
[03:01:43.880 --> 03:01:47.163]  Continuing, Mr. Stack of BlackPill.com.
[03:01:48.104 --> 03:01:50.525]  Devin Stack, I've been asking questions here.
[03:01:50.545 --> 03:01:53.145]  There's only four minutes left of this segment, well another ten minute segment coming up.
[03:01:53.545 --> 03:01:55.666]  What do you want to get into about this world?
[03:01:56.106 --> 03:02:15.830]  Because I agree, you're not being negative, saying we're in an exterminist, globalist, transhumanist plan, where these angry globalists believe humans are obsolete because they hate themselves subconsciously, but aren't sophisticated enough as psychopaths and genetic psychopaths and sociopaths to understand they're projecting their hate of us, which is really hate on themselves,
[03:02:16.790 --> 03:02:17.591]  They don't get it.
[03:02:17.731 --> 03:02:18.491]  Trump gets it.
[03:02:18.591 --> 03:02:19.972]  This is the alternate plan.
[03:02:20.452 --> 03:02:21.233]  Like, here's the deal.
[03:02:22.393 --> 03:02:27.616]  Imagine QAnon attacking me, saying Jones is an agent, Sessions is the best, Trump loves him.
[03:02:27.896 --> 03:02:33.400]  Well, I'm not going to go on air and say what Trump told me about John McCain or what he said about Sessions.
[03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:34.220]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:02:34.700 --> 03:02:36.141]  But I'm real.
[03:02:36.261 --> 03:02:37.042]  Trump talks to me.
[03:02:37.982 --> 03:02:38.903]  Everybody knows that.
[03:02:39.363 --> 03:02:42.866]  It's like, I'm a real person, I'm telling you Trump doesn't like these people.
[03:02:43.267 --> 03:02:45.929]  And is saying, press the attack Jones, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:02:45.989 --> 03:02:50.433]  And then says, here's this campaign person, I'll talk to them, they'll talk to you.
[03:02:50.453 --> 03:02:53.916]  And I'm a little bit out here, the enemy has my phone tapped, they know this.
[03:02:53.936 --> 03:02:59.681]  And then I've got to see some person that doesn't say who they are anonymously, saying I'm against Trump.
[03:03:00.041 --> 03:03:01.522]  No I'm not, you idiots!
[03:03:01.923 --> 03:03:02.203]  Go ahead.
[03:03:03.772 --> 03:03:27.683]  Well, one of the things that tipped me off to really kind of doubting the veracity of QAnon 2 was he was trying to play, or he or she or whoever, was trying to play this game of I have to be anonymous so that no one can know that this information is coming from the White House, but at the same time I'm going to give you this proof that proves that I am who I am.
[03:03:27.723 --> 03:03:29.464]  Well, it's like you can't have it both ways.
[03:03:30.064 --> 03:03:38.474]  If you had something that conclusively proved who you were, something that proved that you were coming from the White House, there would be absolutely no reason to be anonymous.
[03:03:39.495 --> 03:03:42.439]  And so you have a lot of people that are kind of latching onto
[03:03:43.126 --> 03:03:48.427]  Well, some of these things are coincidences, some of these things are just doing research.
[03:03:48.507 --> 03:03:56.269]  It's not that hard to find out what kind of phrasing Trump repeats in his tweets and then try to emulate stuff like that.
[03:03:57.070 --> 03:04:01.211]  But you understood, people like the fortune cookie or the fortune hunter.
[03:04:01.311 --> 03:04:02.471]  They like the mystery.
[03:04:02.531 --> 03:04:06.032]  So the people doing this, I know who they are, it was a group of leftists inside the
[03:04:06.212 --> 03:04:07.953]  The CIA and psych warfare programs.
[03:04:08.273 --> 03:04:10.274]  I know folks that were actually knew who they were.
[03:04:10.294 --> 03:04:13.496]  They even lied to CENTCOM and said, oh, no, we're pro Trump.
[03:04:13.836 --> 03:04:17.098]  And then I was told by CENTCOM and I mean, like.
[03:04:17.178 --> 03:04:18.578]  I'm not going to get into it.
[03:04:18.979 --> 03:04:20.980]  They said blow this operation, and I did.
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:24.581]  They even because we weren't sure that we weren't sure who they were at first.
[03:04:24.621 --> 03:04:25.162]  You understand that?
[03:04:26.723 --> 03:04:31.465]  Well, and the thing that, you know, I wasn't sure, honestly, either when they first went.
[03:04:31.785 --> 03:04:35.227]  I didn't want to talk about it until like I could see where this was going.
[03:04:36.334 --> 03:04:41.879]  But there was a lot of YouTubers making a lot of money, quite frankly, to covering QAnon.
[03:04:42.139 --> 03:04:42.999]  Oh, you're so smart.
[03:04:43.260 --> 03:04:44.280]  I'm not kissing your ass.
[03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:45.281]  You just did it right there.
[03:04:46.222 --> 03:04:51.866]  I noticed right away, if we covered QAnon in a positive way, this is the accidents we did early on.
[03:04:52.126 --> 03:04:55.008]  It was suddenly pushed with millions of views and total monetization.
[03:04:55.309 --> 03:04:56.790]  And that's when I went, ah.
[03:04:59.107 --> 03:05:01.148]  You need to support independent media that's under attack.
[03:05:01.188 --> 03:05:04.631]  We're under attack by these globalists, as you know, and your support's been amazing.
[03:05:04.651 --> 03:05:07.052]  We make it easy to support us because we have great products.
[03:05:07.072 --> 03:05:17.939]  And we're announcing a mega blowout sale at Infowarsstore.com to fund us into the new year so we have a budget to continue on in the face of their attacks.

[03:05:26.405 --> 03:05:26.906]  It's amazing.

[03:05:34.531 --> 03:05:35.492]  Never gone this low.

[03:05:39.335 --> 03:05:42.697]  Brainforce Plus, now available, 50% off.

[03:06:03.826 --> 03:06:07.729]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:07.849 --> 03:06:15.776]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:25.224 --> 03:06:29.147]  You can't go to his website right now.
[03:06:29.187 --> 03:06:31.449]  It's down because of being hammered by massive traffic.
[03:06:32.509 --> 03:06:33.190]  And he deserves it.
[03:06:33.230 --> 03:06:34.170]  BlackPill.com.
[03:06:34.250 --> 03:06:38.474]  Devon Stack, another patriot, just in the last two years, two and a half years, stood up!
[03:06:39.434 --> 03:06:40.575]  What's it mean to stand up an army?
[03:06:40.615 --> 03:06:42.117]  It means you decide to stand up.
[03:06:42.177 --> 03:06:42.697]  You're ready.
[03:06:43.217 --> 03:06:44.178]  You're ready for war.
[03:06:44.759 --> 03:06:45.719]  Information warfare.
[03:06:45.739 --> 03:06:52.565]  And that's why I always had this vision of all these incredible minds of men and women of every race, color, and creed, standing up for the renaissance.
[03:06:53.225 --> 03:06:54.947]  Enrolling this whole planet, it's just like an egg.
[03:06:56.840 --> 03:06:58.882]  It's just one little jump point.
[03:06:59.623 --> 03:07:03.867]  We'll look back later and say, why was it so hard once you've gone to these next heights?
[03:07:04.928 --> 03:07:08.392]  And it's only because when the real challenges come in the future.
[03:07:10.444 --> 03:07:14.126]  We'll realize that we've already come this far together.
[03:07:14.926 --> 03:07:16.947]  What matters is the saga continues.
[03:07:17.667 --> 03:07:18.368]  The Long March.
[03:07:18.928 --> 03:07:28.852]  Here's a few minutes from that video we mentioned, one of hundreds of amazing ones, that Devin Stack breaks down, where he's getting into some of the scams out there.
[03:07:29.313 --> 03:07:30.393]  Not that Bitcoin's a scam.
[03:07:30.673 --> 03:07:31.093]  It's great.
[03:07:31.434 --> 03:07:38.157]  But that some of the scam groups out there, and how they imploded like he said, and then how it ties into the QAnon globalist operation.
[03:07:38.177 --> 03:07:38.477]  Here it is.
[03:07:39.710 --> 03:07:46.937]  I wanted to watch these people who had been calling me a shill, or worse, all because I was trying to help them get their Just Desserts.
[03:07:47.598 --> 03:07:50.621]  But I never got the satisfaction I was hoping for.
[03:07:50.641 --> 03:07:50.761]  It was...
[03:07:53.294 --> 03:07:54.015]  It was just sad.
[03:07:54.915 --> 03:07:59.998]  All I saw was a mix of devastation and denial.
[03:08:00.239 --> 03:08:02.220]  People saying they had lost everything.
[03:08:02.540 --> 03:08:03.981]  People that were going to be homeless now.
[03:08:04.481 --> 03:08:08.884]  There were also people who I would be surprised if they did not commit suicide.
[03:08:08.904 --> 03:08:12.727]  The language that was being used, I mean, people were ruined by this.
[03:08:12.967 --> 03:08:16.950]  But also, in all this devastation, there was also the denial.
[03:08:17.370 --> 03:08:33.342]  There were people that, even though the value of BitConnect had literally gone to zero, still thought that this was all disinformation, and that everyone on Earth but them had fallen for the disinformation, and that now they were gonna double down and buy even more BitConnect.
[03:08:33.442 --> 03:08:34.483]  And people did!
[03:08:34.903 --> 03:08:39.867]  People bought more, even after it had gone to basically zero, people bought more BitConnect.
[03:08:40.408 --> 03:08:41.749]  There was even like a little mini-pump
[03:08:42.489 --> 03:08:43.169]  After the crash.
[03:08:43.310 --> 03:08:46.351]  I don't know why, but I mean, humans are funny that way.
[03:08:46.711 --> 03:08:49.793]  So, needless to say, I didn't get the satisfaction I was looking for.
[03:08:49.813 --> 03:08:51.114]  It was just sad.
[03:08:51.134 --> 03:08:51.934]  It's a perfect dead cat bounce.
[03:08:51.954 --> 03:08:58.298]  And it was sad because the human devastation that was dealt, it was dealt out to people who just wanted to have hope.
[03:08:58.798 --> 03:09:00.559]  They just wanted to have some dreams come true.
[03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:10.285]  And honestly, it takes a certain kind of person to use trust in humanity and hope against people.
[03:09:11.385 --> 03:09:17.488]  So not only were there these human casualties, but, you know, what did this mean for the future of cryptocurrency?
[03:09:18.088 --> 03:09:24.871]  How many of these people you think that had been financially ruined by the BitConnect scam would ever invest in crypto again?
[03:09:25.471 --> 03:09:26.432]  Probably almost none of them.
[03:09:27.072 --> 03:09:28.332]  There was no silver lining.
[03:09:28.853 --> 03:09:32.274]  BitConnect had just been one giant disaster for everyone involved.
[03:09:32.754 --> 03:09:38.777]  So now that I've explained BitConnect to everybody, I guess I should talk about QAnon.
[03:09:40.338 --> 03:09:40.638]  Or maybe
[03:09:41.650 --> 03:09:42.390]  Maybe I just did.
[03:09:45.652 --> 03:09:47.773]  For Black Belt, I'm Devin Stack.
[03:09:49.714 --> 03:09:51.154]  So there's Devin Stack.
[03:09:51.434 --> 03:09:52.855]  We're going to go back to him for like eight minutes.
[03:09:52.875 --> 03:09:55.116]  I want to come back with us in the near future.
[03:09:55.196 --> 03:09:59.518]  Maybe even host an hour or something so he can get all prepared and do it his way instead of me interrupting every ten seconds.
[03:09:59.558 --> 03:10:05.281]  But if you want hope, believe in God yourself and believe in the long road.
[03:10:08.043 --> 03:10:16.909]  Yes, you have the destiny of the universe.
[03:10:16.949 --> 03:10:18.210]  Yes, God made you in the image.
[03:10:18.570 --> 03:10:21.132]  But you don't just instantly abracadabra make things.
[03:10:21.793 --> 03:10:23.474]  And so people want that lottery ticket.
[03:10:23.494 --> 03:10:25.856]  They want that, oh, you know, I'm not going to listen to you.
[03:10:26.216 --> 03:10:26.997]  I've had family.
[03:10:27.893 --> 03:10:30.276]  Uh, you know, swindled by the Nigerian scams.
[03:10:30.316 --> 03:10:31.978]  They don't want to believe they're being scammed.
[03:10:32.018 --> 03:10:32.879]  I say, hey, that's a scam.
[03:10:33.179 --> 03:10:35.942]  You're just jealous I've got this big opportunity with Prince Boo Boo!
[03:10:36.683 --> 03:10:39.566]  And it becomes the same thing over and over again.
[03:10:39.886 --> 03:10:49.376]  So you were going to break there earlier, uh, Mr. Stack, and you were getting into how everybody that promoted QAnon
[03:10:50.242 --> 03:10:51.623]  Everybody promoted it.
[03:10:51.743 --> 03:10:52.784]  YouTube didn't stand in the way.
[03:10:52.864 --> 03:10:54.005]  Google just pumped it.
[03:10:54.065 --> 03:10:54.585]  They pushed it.
[03:10:55.165 --> 03:11:05.453]  For me, I was like, why have I covered QAnon positively, trying to be nice up front, because it suddenly goes super viral, and there's no monetary restriction, which made me stop covering it.
[03:11:05.493 --> 03:11:06.753]  I said, I think this is bad.
[03:11:07.154 --> 03:11:08.194]  They want us to do this.
[03:11:08.515 --> 03:11:10.356]  It's all Pavlovian, carrot and stick.
[03:11:10.656 --> 03:11:11.677]  So get into that.
[03:11:12.813 --> 03:11:27.557]  Well, and the weird thing is, that clip you just played, that video is rated G, there's nothing offensive about it, there's nothing... I mean, because I barely actually talk about QAnon, it's really mostly about BitConnect, so there's no reason for them to demonetize that video at all, and they demonetized it.
[03:11:28.129 --> 03:11:34.572]  And I was like, okay, that's, you know, if I needed some kind of confirmation that I was on the right track, there it is.
[03:11:35.293 --> 03:11:42.857]  And meanwhile, like you said, there's all these other channels that are totally, they're staying monetized.
[03:11:43.416 --> 03:11:46.197]  While they're spreading the QAnon stuff.
[03:11:46.237 --> 03:11:48.658]  So I didn't need anything more than that.
[03:11:48.798 --> 03:11:49.559]  I mean, that was enough.
[03:11:49.819 --> 03:11:58.363]  And then just out of curiosity, and this is before you started seeing like the t-shirts and the signs everywhere at the rallies.
[03:11:58.843 --> 03:12:07.467]  I just searched on Amazon and eBay for QAnon and there were just, and probably still are, just pages and pages and pages of
[03:12:08.048 --> 03:12:13.100]  Shirts and keychains and you know just people making a buck off.
[03:12:13.381 --> 03:12:16.388]  So the deep state algorithm is shoving this at us.
[03:12:16.408 --> 03:12:17.391]  That's got to tell us something.
[03:12:18.359 --> 03:12:36.023]  Well, and then you saw it, like, and this was a couple months ago, when, uh, what was it, like, Vice and all these other guys basically would find QAnon, uh, believers, or whatever you want to call them, and, and try to make them look stupid, and just be like, oh, look at these stupid Trump supporters, they believe in the stupid, you know what I mean?
[03:12:36.063 --> 03:12:46.506]  So, it was, it was real, I mean, and I saw that coming a mile away, and as soon as the, that was the other thing I was trying to explain to the people that, that were into it, I was like, why would, if this was all true information, why would they be
[03:12:47.186 --> 03:12:50.808]  Why would Comedy Central be bringing people's attention to it?
[03:12:50.828 --> 03:12:57.471]  Sure, it's making fun of it, but all press is good press in some ways.
[03:12:57.811 --> 03:13:05.394]  I agree with you, but there's the argument that, oh, they attack Alex Jones, but when they attack me, it's to say I'm doing racist things, I should be banned.
[03:13:05.714 --> 03:13:07.095]  They weren't saying ban QAnon.
[03:13:07.495 --> 03:13:08.416]  With me, it was different.
[03:13:08.456 --> 03:13:09.877]  It's like, Jones did this.
[03:13:10.317 --> 03:13:11.899]  Owen Schreier is mean to black people.
[03:13:11.999 --> 03:13:12.419]  Ban him.
[03:13:12.660 --> 03:13:13.540]  And it's not true.
[03:13:13.580 --> 03:13:14.721]  You see, there's two different things.
[03:13:14.761 --> 03:13:16.423]  If they're just promoting it and making fun, yes.
[03:13:16.863 --> 03:13:20.266]  But if they're saying, ban you and association, it's different.
[03:13:21.427 --> 03:13:21.667]  Right.
[03:13:21.827 --> 03:13:25.050]  And they made no attempt to ban QAnon.
[03:13:25.811 --> 03:13:27.953]  It was a nice target for them.
[03:13:28.253 --> 03:13:33.037]  They could point at QAnon and say, look at the crazy Trump supporters.
[03:13:33.578 --> 03:13:35.219]  And at the same time, it also helped
[03:13:35.916 --> 03:13:37.325]  By doing that, it helps.
[03:13:38.958 --> 03:13:42.359]  Like I said, there was some truth in some of what QAnon was saying.
[03:13:42.399 --> 03:13:43.380]  Sure, it covered real things.
[03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:44.140]  Let me ask you this question.
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:44.800]  You're a smart guy.
[03:13:44.820 --> 03:13:46.160]  I haven't had time to track it.
[03:13:46.201 --> 03:13:47.301]  I'm so busy covering the news.
[03:13:47.821 --> 03:13:57.824]  What are they doing now, these pro-QAnon people that are like, Trump loves Sessions, and Jones is going to prison, and I'll stick with the president.
[03:13:58.184 --> 03:14:02.086]  Jones woke me up, but Jones is with the bad guys now.
[03:14:02.506 --> 03:14:05.847]  What are those people thinking now that everything we told them is happening?
[03:14:07.225 --> 03:14:09.306]  I think the election brought a lot of them around.
[03:14:09.527 --> 03:14:11.388]  I mean, there's some that are going to hold on forever.
[03:14:11.428 --> 03:14:12.849]  I mean, there's nothing.
[03:14:12.869 --> 03:14:19.253]  I mean, I knew as soon as the election results came in, because that was the big thing, right, was the election is going to happen.
[03:14:19.553 --> 03:14:22.115]  They're going to win the House and the Senate.
[03:14:22.775 --> 03:14:28.679]  And that's when Sessions is going to swoop in and start sending everyone to Guantanamo Bay.
[03:14:29.320 --> 03:14:33.022]  And I knew that that was unlikely that they would win the House and the Senate.
[03:14:33.202 --> 03:14:35.764]  And as soon as I saw that they lost the House,
[03:14:36.491 --> 03:14:47.938]  I was like, okay, so first of all, you had a lot of people that probably didn't go vote because... No, exactly, because all over the internet, Google is hammering, we won, it's over, don't vote, everything's fine!
[03:14:48.938 --> 03:14:50.899]  Well, and even Fox News... Alex Jones is the enemy!
[03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:56.903]  Even Fox News called the election like 90 minutes before, like while voting was still going on.
[03:14:57.043 --> 03:15:00.645]  And you notice now the Democrats are stealing Florida and Arizona right now.
[03:15:01.604 --> 03:15:02.204]  Well, right.
[03:15:02.345 --> 03:15:21.557]  And that's actually another thing that's kind of frustrating, because I just saw on Twitter, like a couple minutes before I came on here, that the, I forget the name of the agency, the agency that's in charge of investigating voter fraud, just said, they responded to a reporter that asked, hey, are you investigating what's going on in Florida?
[03:15:21.937 --> 03:15:26.500]  They said, no, we can't until the State Department tells us to, and they haven't told us to.
[03:15:26.821 --> 03:15:29.402]  Which shows the State Department is still Democrat run.
[03:15:29.442 --> 03:15:30.263]  You made videos on that.
[03:15:31.363 --> 03:15:33.385]  Devin, I'm impressed with people who do the research.
[03:15:33.505 --> 03:15:34.486]  I listen to you, I know.
[03:15:34.506 --> 03:15:36.328]  You're doing your frickin' research.
[03:15:36.348 --> 03:15:40.412]  So I feel good when I go to sleep at night knowing that Devin Stack of BlackPill.com is there.
[03:15:40.932 --> 03:15:41.953]  Join us routinely.
[03:15:42.013 --> 03:15:42.954]  Come back on the other shows.
[03:15:43.314 --> 03:15:44.115]  We appreciate you.
[03:15:44.395 --> 03:15:44.816]  We love you.
[03:15:44.836 --> 03:15:45.316]  You're awesome.
[03:15:45.657 --> 03:15:50.601]  Huge news with Rob Dew on the other side and then Dr. Nick Baggett straight ahead.
[03:15:53.384 --> 03:15:54.545]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:54.605 --> 03:15:55.566]  Newswars.com.
[03:15:55.586 --> 03:15:56.387]  Spread those links.
[03:16:00.518 --> 03:16:06.344]  That's why it's like, you know, being able to just ignore the rules.
[03:16:06.904 --> 03:16:08.126]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:16:08.606 --> 03:16:16.494]  But it's also like, I just, like, for me, I can ignore the rules and I don't mind breaking the rules and I can defend any position I can defend.
[03:16:16.514 --> 03:16:19.998]  I mean, like you said, you've already used the campaign.
[03:16:20.838 --> 03:16:21.759]  What else?
[03:16:23.220 --> 03:16:26.041]  We're already at that point.
[03:16:26.061 --> 03:16:26.341]  Yeah.
[03:16:27.262 --> 03:16:31.764]  And, you know, if you can use the vans to help transport people.
[03:16:31.784 --> 03:16:33.084]  Yeah, I'm gonna open the van.
[03:16:33.124 --> 03:16:35.606]  We're gonna make it f***ing happen.
[03:16:35.626 --> 03:16:37.426]  I'm like, I'm done.
[03:16:37.466 --> 03:16:40.448]  I'm just like f***ing running full speed now, you know?
[03:16:40.708 --> 03:16:41.568]  Just getting it done.
[03:16:41.828 --> 03:16:42.149]  I'm done.
[03:16:42.489 --> 03:16:43.529]  I'm done being nice.
[03:16:43.549 --> 03:16:45.670]  I'm done being professional.
[03:16:46.150 --> 03:16:47.511]  You know?
[03:16:47.551 --> 03:16:48.351]  Nothing is professional.
[03:16:48.371 --> 03:16:49.772]  None of this is like f***ing professional.
[03:16:50.511 --> 03:16:56.915]  So there's like a, you know, that migrant caravan.
[03:16:56.935 --> 03:17:01.357]  They just, a few of them got here already and they're dropping them off, like, really close to Missouri.
[03:17:01.858 --> 03:17:02.058]  Who?
[03:17:02.458 --> 03:17:04.099]  Oh, the Hondurans?
[03:17:04.319 --> 03:17:06.360]  Oh, the Hondurans, yeah.
[03:17:06.460 --> 03:17:10.282]  It's this holy thing, holy something church, but it's actually really close here to downtown, she said.
[03:17:10.863 --> 03:17:11.943]  She texted me the address.
[03:17:25.906 --> 03:17:32.349]  Dominique Chacon is a field manager for the Beto O'Rourke Senate campaign in the campaign's headquarters in El Paso.
[03:17:32.989 --> 03:17:36.932]  He got the tip about the migrants and marshaled the campaign staff to act.
[03:17:37.572 --> 03:17:41.054]  Whether or not it was legal did not seem to concern him.
[03:17:44.350 --> 03:17:55.994]  I think they accepted them as asylum seekers and so the way they do it is that there's like these certain organizations and churches that they allow these migrants to stay in until they get like a court date and then they're attorneys and then
[03:18:02.214 --> 03:18:04.216]  This is just violating campaign finance law.
[03:18:04.556 --> 03:18:07.138]  This is literally being a Benedict Arnold.
[03:18:07.378 --> 03:18:08.479]  Thank you for joining us, James.
[03:18:08.499 --> 03:18:09.599]  You've only got eight minutes.
[03:18:09.619 --> 03:18:10.260]  You've got the floor.
[03:18:10.520 --> 03:18:11.180]  Tell us what's happening.
[03:18:27.071 --> 03:18:28.292]  They are the source of this information.
[03:18:28.392 --> 03:18:30.092]  They are the source of this information.
[03:18:30.193 --> 03:18:45.080]  So in Texas, this is last night, we just confirmed yesterday morning, I'm actually in El Paso right now, we just confirmed that Jody Casey, the campaign manager for Beto O'Rourke, it's a $100 million operation now because they raised all this money.
[03:18:45.220 --> 03:18:52.283]  She told our undercover reporter not to worry about using campaign funds to pay for the illegal migrants.
[03:18:52.663 --> 03:19:03.107]  After her staff was on tape saying that they have to lie, mask, break the law in violation of campaign finance law to use the funds to pay for the migrants.
[03:19:03.147 --> 03:19:06.409]  So we have the campaign manager on tape saying, don't worry about doing it.
[03:19:06.489 --> 03:19:09.610]  And we have the staffers on tape doing it and talking about doing it.
[03:19:09.630 --> 03:19:11.250]  This is not my proposition.
[03:19:11.450 --> 03:19:12.591]  I did not bait them.
[03:19:12.671 --> 03:19:17.593]  They volunteered this information to us when they did not know they were being recorded, Alex.
[03:19:17.813 --> 03:19:20.494]  This may be the biggest thing we've ever done, and don't take my word for it.
[03:19:20.614 --> 03:19:22.434]  I've had Dinesh D'Souza text me today.
[03:19:22.514 --> 03:19:23.755]  I've had Dana Lash text me.
[03:19:23.775 --> 03:19:27.776]  I've had all these people texting me saying, this is such a big story.
[03:19:28.016 --> 03:19:37.939]  And I hope that all this comes out in a couple days before the election, but it requires all of you listening right now, share this video to everyone that you know.
[03:19:38.019 --> 03:19:39.920]  It's the only way that we're going to get accountability.
[03:19:40.060 --> 03:19:41.261]  Our listeners shouldn't wait.
[03:19:41.341 --> 03:19:43.343]  Don't wait for InfoWars or Veritas to do it.
[03:19:43.383 --> 03:19:49.828]  You must all go to his campaign stops, wherever you are, with a camera, with your cell phone, and bring this up to this monster.
[03:19:50.028 --> 03:19:56.133]  Everyone must go peacefully confront this Benedict Arnold because we know these orders are coming from the top.
[03:20:01.457 --> 03:20:04.119]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.876 --> 03:20:22.740]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[03:20:23.320 --> 03:20:26.563]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[03:20:31.135 --> 03:20:33.276]  All right, Dr. Nick Baggish is taking over the next half hour.
[03:20:33.336 --> 03:20:40.860]  Then the war room with Owen Schroer, Roger Shiller, and others is wound up like racehorses in the gates, ready.
[03:20:41.200 --> 03:20:43.221]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:20:44.562 --> 03:20:46.423]  You know, there's a lot I haven't gotten to today.
[03:20:46.923 --> 03:20:47.764]  We've done an okay job.
[03:20:47.784 --> 03:20:50.145]  Well, you know one thing I didn't realize, Alex.
[03:20:51.065 --> 03:20:55.568]  I didn't realize that QAnon was an old southern gentleman who sips lemonade out by the porch.
[03:20:56.454 --> 03:20:57.895]  You were doing that QAnon voice earlier?
[03:20:58.675 --> 03:21:00.456]  Alex Jones is a bad man.
[03:21:00.496 --> 03:21:01.636]  He's going to jail.
[03:21:01.656 --> 03:21:05.518]  I didn't realize that's who... Alex Jones hates Trump and hates America.
[03:21:05.818 --> 03:21:08.099]  He wants to turn in your guns, boy.
[03:21:08.999 --> 03:21:10.420]  Alex Jones!
[03:21:10.460 --> 03:21:11.901]  We are secret over here.
[03:21:11.921 --> 03:21:13.321]  We know how to deal with it.
[03:21:13.821 --> 03:21:16.342]  Oh, Ted Sessions knows what he's doing.
[03:21:16.362 --> 03:21:18.443]  He said, trust the plan.
[03:21:18.503 --> 03:21:20.364]  It'll get you there right now, my babies.
[03:21:21.745 --> 03:21:24.446]  You don't trust him, Jones, it's gonna get you in a lot of trouble.
[03:21:26.135 --> 03:21:27.256]  See, you learn something new every day.
[03:21:28.077 --> 03:21:30.480]  I try to learn a few things every day, but that I did not know.
[03:21:30.640 --> 03:21:31.601]  It's total operatives.
[03:21:32.422 --> 03:21:36.026]  The point is, I didn't want to even get into it, but my God, how obvious is it?
[03:21:36.526 --> 03:21:36.927]  Here's the deal.
[03:21:39.540 --> 03:21:40.520]  A lot is going on.
[03:21:40.941 --> 03:21:43.962]  We are in the middle of a civil war in this country against foreign globalist forces.
[03:21:44.402 --> 03:21:57.747]  And if we could just point out, hey, it's foreign chi-com and EU and banking forces that think they run America and use our open society as a way to get in there and do this, and Trump's just an American who doesn't think we should give the country up and they think that's mentally ill, then it's over.
[03:21:57.827 --> 03:21:59.368]  Like, join America or don't.
[03:21:59.988 --> 03:22:01.389]  There's not even a discussion at this point.
[03:22:01.729 --> 03:22:02.189]  People say like,
[03:22:03.641 --> 03:22:09.165]  Alex used to be independent against Republicans and Democrats, and then Trump comes along and suddenly you're fully behind it.
[03:22:09.885 --> 03:22:20.532]  Because Trump, I built, we built, the audience built a big missile launching base, and then Trump the missile arrived on the back of a big missile launching truck.
[03:22:21.292 --> 03:22:22.372]  We want America.
[03:22:22.412 --> 03:22:23.833]  We want to control our own country.
[03:22:24.153 --> 03:22:25.433]  We want to cut taxes.
[03:22:25.453 --> 03:22:26.674]  We want to defeat globalism.
[03:22:26.974 --> 03:22:28.614]  We want to leave families alone.
[03:22:29.755 --> 03:22:31.295]  Trump, we built Trump.
[03:22:31.375 --> 03:22:32.316]  Trump is ours.
[03:22:32.396 --> 03:22:33.196]  This is it.
[03:22:33.616 --> 03:22:38.458]  He wouldn't have been able to do this if we hadn't been here, and we wouldn't do it if he wasn't there.
[03:22:38.598 --> 03:22:40.118]  It's destiny, folks.
[03:22:40.598 --> 03:22:45.580]  It's here, and you see the full attack of the enemy because it is real!
[03:22:46.340 --> 03:22:47.600]  So they act like, why are you?
[03:22:48.221 --> 03:22:50.061]  The whole establishment's against Trump!
[03:22:50.161 --> 03:22:50.541]  Exactly.
[03:22:50.581 --> 03:22:53.702]  You have to have a disruptor for any real change to happen in this world.
[03:22:53.782 --> 03:22:57.083]  And we know we've been controlled by giant multinational corporations.
[03:22:57.203 --> 03:23:01.244]  And Trump is, all Trump is, is a person that has come in and said, you know what?
[03:23:01.724 --> 03:23:05.285]  I'm going to unbuckle the latches that are holding you down.
[03:23:05.685 --> 03:23:08.906]  But it's up to you to make the change and be the change you want to see in this world.
[03:23:09.526 --> 03:23:12.648]  He's like, this is a super rich country in pole position.
[03:23:13.209 --> 03:23:23.276]  Why, because a bunch of leftist robber baron kids have needle dick syndrome, should we sign it over to the Chinese that half their country doesn't have running water and bow down to them?
[03:23:23.616 --> 03:23:26.878]  I mean, it's like, it's not even like a wimpy thing like, oh, I love America.
[03:23:27.699 --> 03:23:28.680]  Dude, this is BS!
[03:23:28.780 --> 03:23:29.561]  We're in command!
[03:23:29.941 --> 03:23:31.983]  Why would we try to make people poor?
[03:23:32.443 --> 03:23:37.748]  Why would we try to, like, break up families so a bunch of professors, you know, that have needle dick syndrome can feel powerful?
[03:23:38.189 --> 03:23:39.250]  That's why they're so scared.
[03:23:39.270 --> 03:23:42.273]  Because the real obviousness is in American supremacy.
[03:23:42.733 --> 03:23:44.375]  Not through weapons, but through ideas.
[03:23:44.815 --> 03:23:46.336]  And Russia is like a woman!
[03:23:47.489 --> 03:23:49.070]  Like Marilyn Monroe in bed waiting for us.
[03:23:49.670 --> 03:23:50.491]  Everything is ready.
[03:23:50.671 --> 03:23:51.852]  They don't want radical Islam.
[03:23:51.892 --> 03:23:52.312]  No one does.
[03:23:52.352 --> 03:23:53.913]  They want 57 Chevys.
[03:23:54.293 --> 03:23:55.194]  They want power.
[03:23:55.254 --> 03:23:55.954]  They want success.
[03:23:55.974 --> 03:23:56.935]  They want space programs.
[03:23:57.155 --> 03:23:58.996]  They want huge space operations.
[03:23:59.056 --> 03:24:01.097]  They want... Just get out of the way, man!
[03:24:01.257 --> 03:24:02.738]  Move, bitch!
[03:24:03.078 --> 03:24:04.239]  Get out the way!
[03:24:04.379 --> 03:24:05.160]  Move, bitch!
[03:24:05.460 --> 03:24:06.220]  So this is it.
[03:24:06.340 --> 03:24:07.741]  And we will not fail.
[03:24:08.162 --> 03:24:09.102]  No, not at this point.
[03:24:09.122 --> 03:24:12.304]  But imagine being a chicken crap globalist from the chicken, you know it, dimension.
[03:24:12.324 --> 03:24:13.705]  The chicken, S-H, dimension.
[03:24:13.945 --> 03:24:14.726]  It's my coined term.
[03:24:15.763 --> 03:24:19.607]  They see freedom and middle classes and expansion as scary.
[03:24:20.248 --> 03:24:21.229]  I know, we can't have that.
[03:24:21.249 --> 03:24:26.314]  God, everyone's getting along and they're all intermarrying and being happy.
[03:24:26.835 --> 03:24:29.998]  Let's teach them in the name of diversity that everyone hates each other.
[03:24:30.378 --> 03:24:30.919]  Exactly.
[03:24:31.540 --> 03:24:33.782]  And so humanity goes straight up.
[03:24:33.962 --> 03:24:36.323]  They really have created, half the population is mentally ill.
[03:24:36.603 --> 03:24:40.444]  And they, you can show them a video of Jim Acosta hitting a woman's arm and they're like, he didn't touch her.
[03:24:40.744 --> 03:24:41.344]  He didn't touch her.
[03:24:41.504 --> 03:24:42.404]  He said he didn't touch her.
[03:24:42.424 --> 03:24:43.324]  He said it on TV.
[03:24:43.364 --> 03:24:44.445]  That must mean it's true.
[03:24:44.465 --> 03:24:47.685]  Well, let's talk about the IT guy in control of the situation in Florida.
[03:24:47.705 --> 03:24:49.426]  He's a special little character.
[03:24:49.486 --> 03:24:51.746]  Well, so right now they're having this recount in Florida.
[03:24:51.766 --> 03:24:53.427]  They're having one in Arizona and one in Georgia.
[03:24:53.447 --> 03:24:55.107]  And it looks like they're trying to steal these things.
[03:24:55.707 --> 03:25:00.869]  And so the lady in charge of the, in Broward County, seems to be the key, which is what we said that night.
[03:25:01.209 --> 03:25:01.829]  Stone brought it up.
[03:25:02.429 --> 03:25:04.449]  And now they find these provisional ballots.
[03:25:05.310 --> 03:25:05.590]  Okay.
[03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:06.990]  Well, here's the guy.
[03:25:07.290 --> 03:25:11.110]  So at the end of the day, all this has to go through a company.
[03:25:11.130 --> 03:25:15.051]  And so there's a company called CloudFlare that is watching and monitoring election sites.
[03:25:15.091 --> 03:25:21.332]  They hired this man, Joe Sullivan, who is, uh, he's one of CloudFlare's security officers.
[03:25:21.532 --> 03:25:21.772]  Okay.
[03:25:21.852 --> 03:25:31.614]  Before that, he was working at Uber and he got fired from Uber after Uber got hacked and then where they stole 57 million people's data.
[03:25:32.512 --> 03:25:39.577]  Uh, he, what he did was pay off the hackers and got them to say, hey, uh, you guys, uh, y'all, y'all are part of our program.
[03:25:40.097 --> 03:25:40.998]  Let's meet Bain.
[03:25:41.058 --> 03:25:41.278]  Yeah.
[03:25:41.378 --> 03:25:41.638]  Yeah.
[03:25:41.778 --> 03:25:42.358]  Exactly.
[03:25:42.759 --> 03:25:51.384]  So now that, and this guy before that, he worked in Facebook, he worked at eBay, he worked at Airbnb, but Obama's cybersecurity council was also where he was.
[03:25:51.704 --> 03:25:53.706]  So, so he's the anointed one.
[03:25:54.326 --> 03:25:57.208]  This is who's in charge of the digital keys.
[03:25:57.869 --> 03:25:59.210]  And you have Broward County.
[03:25:59.250 --> 03:26:01.271]  Which Apple has moved to China and given to them.
[03:26:01.311 --> 03:26:03.213]  So he's a very nice person.
[03:26:03.353 --> 03:26:03.813]  Exactly.
[03:26:04.094 --> 03:26:08.557]  So it's very interesting when you see where these people go and you look at their past areas.
[03:26:09.218 --> 03:26:12.280]  And that just came through the wire.
[03:26:12.300 --> 03:26:14.281]  And I'm looking at them like, well now it's starting to make sense.
[03:26:14.301 --> 03:26:15.302]  They got the people in place.
[03:26:15.342 --> 03:26:18.365]  Notice Jeb Bush is the one who put in this lady, what was her name, Stackers.
[03:26:20.346 --> 03:26:21.626]  Yeah, the Crip Keeper down there.
[03:26:22.086 --> 03:26:26.368]  Jeb Bush put her in charge, and how can you not get these people out once they go in?
[03:26:26.668 --> 03:26:28.389]  It was like the election judge that we saw.
[03:26:28.429 --> 03:26:31.871]  Every election, magically, 50 million ballots needed.
[03:26:31.891 --> 03:26:34.732]  Bigger than the state population, and Broward County's got them.
[03:26:35.092 --> 03:26:36.873]  Oh, they do, and they have trucks, and they find them.
[03:26:36.913 --> 03:26:39.614]  Brenda Snipes, that's who it is, Brenda Snipes.
[03:26:39.634 --> 03:26:42.595]  80,000 votes arrive, and no one asks, where are these trucks coming from?
[03:26:42.615 --> 03:26:43.736]  Where'd you find these?
[03:26:43.756 --> 03:26:45.477]  Oh, we had them in the back the whole time.
[03:26:47.677 --> 03:27:07.702]  There's somebody else showed a picture of here they are and there's a box and there's papers on top of like we found more ballots and it's just it's insanity after insanity so hopefully the lawyers are in place and the lawyers are monitoring this stuff so they can there's a little ballot box underneath some folders there it is they're trying to steal a Senate seat Oh a governor seat
[03:27:07.802 --> 03:27:08.622]  They can still three Senate seats.
[03:27:08.642 --> 03:27:09.683]  And they're doing the same thing.
[03:27:09.743 --> 03:27:11.223]  They can still three Senate seats right now.
[03:27:11.564 --> 03:27:13.724]  And then get this stuff back to square one almost.
[03:27:13.784 --> 03:27:18.146]  So now it all makes sense when you see Ruth Bader Ginsburg not looking so good.
[03:27:18.166 --> 03:27:22.048]  They just released her out of the hospital and man she did not look good.
[03:27:22.588 --> 03:27:26.170]  TMZ has a video of her being wheeled off into a car.
[03:27:26.210 --> 03:27:30.571]  She was able to stand up and get into the car but she's looking more and more like Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:30.591 --> 03:27:31.632]  You know that's terrible.
[03:27:31.752 --> 03:27:32.032]  It is.
[03:27:32.752 --> 03:27:34.233]  But they're gonna have to replace her.
[03:27:34.253 --> 03:27:34.873]  It's just terrible.
[03:27:34.913 --> 03:27:35.874]  And that's what they don't want.
[03:27:35.914 --> 03:27:36.594]  Not a good omen.
[03:27:37.861 --> 03:27:41.363]  Well... There she is, right there.
[03:27:43.163 --> 03:27:44.224]  Things aren't going too well.
[03:27:51.267 --> 03:27:59.110]  The jaws of hell open wide as Lucifer's tongue rolls out, dripping with the blood of the innocent, awaiting new souls.
[03:27:59.771 --> 03:28:02.732]  And a special shell of the Night Circle is prepared.
[03:28:05.692 --> 03:28:09.334]  I sense Amy Coney Barrett getting nominated for the Supreme Court.
[03:28:09.754 --> 03:28:10.934]  Just watching this video right here.
[03:28:10.994 --> 03:28:11.494]  Very soon.
[03:28:11.574 --> 03:28:12.435]  Within a year.
[03:28:12.815 --> 03:28:13.635]  Definitely within a year.
[03:28:14.416 --> 03:28:15.776]  Boy, they're trying to prop her up.
[03:28:15.856 --> 03:28:16.096]  Yeah.
[03:28:16.777 --> 03:28:19.438]  Alyssa Milano wanted to give her some ribs, a kidney, and a lung.
[03:28:19.458 --> 03:28:21.018]  Good!
[03:28:21.658 --> 03:28:22.039]  Good!
[03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:28.621]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[03:28:31.262 --> 03:28:32.303]  Anyways, coming up...
[03:28:36.690 --> 03:28:39.231]  America is mine!
[03:28:39.992 --> 03:28:46.795]  From destiny, I, the fallen, will soon rise against you, and all of your spoils will be mine.
[03:28:46.935 --> 03:28:51.297]  But in the end, the wicked were only meant to awaken the righteous.
[03:28:52.577 --> 03:28:57.820]  Dr. Nick Beggins, straight ahead, and in the War Room, T-minus 30 minutes, InfoWars.com.

[03:29:15.115 --> 03:29:16.216]  So, if you have a heart,

[03:29:34.875 --> 03:29:36.635]  It's one of the very best heart pills out there.
[03:29:36.935 --> 03:29:37.716]  It's XtendoWise.
[03:29:37.916 --> 03:29:40.636]  So, get some for yourself and family and friends.
[03:29:41.016 --> 03:29:44.077]  It's got the very best fish oil from the Fjords.
[03:29:44.117 --> 03:29:49.478]  It's very, very pure, very, very clean and has the EPA type that is specifically good for the heart, cardiovascular system.
[03:29:50.138 --> 03:29:53.639]  It's got the properly formulated type of CoQ10 and more.
[03:29:53.979 --> 03:29:55.539]  It is XtendoWise.
[03:29:55.579 --> 03:29:57.760]  Now available at m4warslife.com.
[03:29:58.500 --> 03:30:06.549]  One of the most amazing products that I've seen in years is Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse, available at InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:30:06.969 --> 03:30:11.894]  Now, I've got some bags under my eyes, especially right now with really bad allergies in Austin, Texas.
[03:30:12.335 --> 03:30:15.518]  Mold's been at like 1,400 or something, as high as it ever gets.
[03:30:15.799 --> 03:30:16.720]  That makes me get puffy.
[03:30:17.921 --> 03:30:19.462]  But, if I use
[03:30:20.283 --> 03:30:25.827]  Just one little container of Ageless, and I can share it with both eyes.
[03:30:26.508 --> 03:30:32.632]  Within three minutes, you'll see dramatic results, ladies and gentlemen, because I've got some bad bags with allergies.
[03:30:32.672 --> 03:30:34.453]  Plus, I work 15, 16 hours a day.
[03:30:34.814 --> 03:30:37.636]  Everybody knows fighting the globalists is a stressful job.
[03:30:38.036 --> 03:30:39.197]  So, again, just twist it off.
[03:30:41.198 --> 03:30:42.618]  Even, you know, a dummy like me can put it under.
[03:30:43.799 --> 03:30:50.920]  Because I'm not a big metrosexual guy, you know, that worries about my wrinkles, worries about things like that.
[03:30:50.940 --> 03:30:58.662]  But when it comes to having bags under your eyes and being on television or just, you know, anybody in regular life, it's something good to do.
[03:30:59.282 --> 03:31:01.842]  And again, a lot of folks use one per eye.
[03:31:03.202 --> 03:31:05.883]  I have found that the other times I've used it,
[03:31:08.837 --> 03:31:10.978]  I don't even need to use an entire container.
[03:31:11.498 --> 03:31:11.998]  So there you go.
[03:31:12.078 --> 03:31:14.039]  I'm not a cosmetic person.
[03:31:14.159 --> 03:31:17.140]  I'm not an expert on skin, any of that stuff.
[03:31:17.520 --> 03:31:20.981]  All I know is over the years I've tried some other products that haven't done anything.
[03:31:21.101 --> 03:31:22.621]  Ageless has a massive effect.
[03:31:23.142 --> 03:31:27.563]  So you get a great product for yourself, for your wife, for your boyfriend, for your girlfriend.
[03:31:27.903 --> 03:31:28.843]  It's good for men and women.
[03:31:29.564 --> 03:31:33.825]  And you fund the InfoWars at infowarsps.com.
[03:31:33.845 --> 03:31:36.426]  So let's see what happens in the next, I guess, two and a half minutes now.
[03:31:37.816 --> 03:31:38.677]  I'm a human being.
[03:31:38.777 --> 03:31:39.559]  I have dignity.
[03:31:39.839 --> 03:31:40.400]  I'm gonna resist.
[03:31:40.580 --> 03:31:42.844]  I'm gonna start recognizing the propaganda.
[03:31:42.864 --> 03:31:44.366]  I'm gonna break free from it.
[03:31:44.407 --> 03:31:45.809]  Humanity's gonna come together.
[03:31:56.252 --> 03:31:56.873]  So there you go.
[03:31:57.734 --> 03:31:59.476]  I just applied that kind of like a monkey would.
[03:31:59.496 --> 03:32:02.180]  Not as good as a woman or somebody that's good at this stuff.
[03:32:02.680 --> 03:32:03.862]  And I can already feel it tightening.
[03:32:03.902 --> 03:32:04.943]  It already feels good.
[03:32:05.304 --> 03:32:05.904]  Feels cool.
[03:32:06.846 --> 03:32:08.087]  It's pretty much dry now.
[03:32:08.167 --> 03:32:10.310]  I'm going to go back and look at the time lapse.
[03:32:10.751 --> 03:32:11.532]  It's pretty dramatic.
[03:32:11.932 --> 03:32:12.933]  At least in the past when I've done it.
[03:32:12.953 --> 03:32:13.775]  We'll see what happens here.
[03:32:14.435 --> 03:32:20.699]  It is instantly ageless, along with some other amazing products as well for the skin, supplements, energy.
[03:32:20.779 --> 03:32:23.980]  It's all amazing cutting edge at InfoWarsGS.com.
[03:32:24.521 --> 03:32:26.922]  When you get the GNS products there, you get big discounts.
[03:32:27.382 --> 03:32:28.403]  There's a lot of different specials.
[03:32:28.423 --> 03:32:37.148]  You can also sign up to be a distributor, and that helps fund the war against the globalists and help us continue to try to make America and the planet successful, capitalist, and free again.
[03:32:37.828 --> 03:32:38.669]  Wars are expensive.
[03:32:38.709 --> 03:32:39.429]  We're fighting one.
[03:32:39.729 --> 03:32:40.230]  We're winning.
[03:32:40.250 --> 03:32:41.251]  Thanks for your support.
[03:32:41.551 --> 03:32:43.792]  We try to bring you great products to make it easy to support us.
[03:32:44.072 --> 03:32:45.293]  And this one is a big winner.
[03:32:45.734 --> 03:32:48.616]  Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse at InfoWarsYes.com.

[03:33:02.345 --> 03:33:04.967]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.278 --> 03:33:33.202]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com, and this is Dr. Nick Begich, and I'm in for the last half hour of today's broadcast.
[03:33:33.902 --> 03:33:42.587]  And, you know, thinking about where Alex left off in the last segment, you know, Trump is the antidote, you know what I'm saying?
[03:33:42.647 --> 03:33:50.771]  I mean, really, if you think about what's been shaken up in the last couple of years, it's pretty outstanding all the way around.
[03:33:50.851 --> 03:33:52.252]  And as I look
[03:33:53.493 --> 03:33:56.214]  Forward, you know, right now, this is really an important time.
[03:33:56.234 --> 03:33:59.615]  You know, people are still thinking about, oh, the elections and how the House switched.
[03:34:00.315 --> 03:34:07.257]  This could be the most powerful lame duck session in history, if we think about it that way.
[03:34:07.437 --> 03:34:12.059]  And, you know, there's still a few months left to get some things done, you might say.
[03:34:12.439 --> 03:34:15.700]  Well, there's majorities in both the House and the Senate.
[03:34:18.087 --> 03:34:19.267]  Are they bold enough?
[03:34:19.588 --> 03:34:20.868]  Are they strong enough?
[03:34:20.988 --> 03:34:21.848]  Will they do it?
[03:34:22.128 --> 03:34:23.629]  I don't know, but they sure could.
[03:34:23.669 --> 03:34:27.450]  They're still in charge until January, third week in January.
[03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:36.313]  So I would suggest contact your congressional delegation and ask them to back up Trump.
[03:34:37.029 --> 03:34:38.470]  And get the agenda done.
[03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:40.051]  We only had a few months left.
[03:34:40.631 --> 03:34:45.174]  So clear out the calendar and get people to work.
[03:34:46.575 --> 03:34:47.556]  Let's see what happens.
[03:34:47.996 --> 03:34:49.697]  And then we got gridlocked, right?
[03:34:49.857 --> 03:34:52.179]  For the next two years to see what happens.
[03:34:52.219 --> 03:34:54.140]  And that's really unfortunate as I look.
[03:34:54.800 --> 03:34:56.801]  I'm at what's happening in the world today.
[03:34:56.821 --> 03:35:01.882]  You know, when you think about the Senate is still a majority Republican.
[03:35:02.202 --> 03:35:10.965]  The House obviously went the other way, but everybody gets sworn in the beginning of the year.
[03:35:11.405 --> 03:35:12.506]  So we have a few months.
[03:35:13.386 --> 03:35:18.688]  Might interrupt a few party plans, but so to speak, but it's time to do it.
[03:35:19.448 --> 03:35:19.668]  You know,
[03:35:20.572 --> 03:35:24.453]  I'm thinking about really what this last election was about.
[03:35:24.473 --> 03:35:32.775]  You know, they tried to make it about people, personalities, all this stuff, and they forget the idea that it's really about ideas.
[03:35:34.255 --> 03:35:36.195]  What does the country believe in?
[03:35:36.235 --> 03:35:44.237]  What does the population want to see change or happen in this next couple of years?
[03:35:45.878 --> 03:36:00.771]  You have to be active, you have to get involved, and at some level, now's the time really to think about what's happened in personal privacy, the idea that this broadcast is being restricted, the idea of information being restricted two years out.
[03:36:01.251 --> 03:36:02.172]  Lame duck session.
[03:36:03.333 --> 03:36:09.538]  Let's address some of the privacy issues, the communication issues, and make sure we have an open, fair, and free press.
[03:36:10.390 --> 03:36:12.731]  I mean, everyone's talking about fair trade.
[03:36:12.751 --> 03:36:27.259]  How about a fair and free press so we can even have a conversation about free trade and what all that means, you know, and all the other important issues that Americans deal with and our true allies around the world do as well.
[03:36:27.339 --> 03:36:31.961]  So now is really a time to use the lame duck session, address
[03:36:32.671 --> 03:36:36.915]  The holes in the program that need to be filled right now.
[03:36:36.935 --> 03:36:43.680]  And the biggest one is to make sure we have the ability to get our messages out, to have our conversation with the public.
[03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:49.005]  And if people don't like what's being said, they have the right of everyone else to do exactly what you can do.
[03:36:49.465 --> 03:36:50.886]  Change the channel.
[03:36:51.167 --> 03:36:51.367]  You know?
[03:36:51.989 --> 03:36:57.333]  But to shut the channel down is not the way of a Democratic-Republican something.
[03:36:58.434 --> 03:37:03.077]  If we haven't learned anything, that we better understand.
[03:37:04.098 --> 03:37:07.000]  So, you know, it's now's the time.
[03:37:07.100 --> 03:37:08.040]  Let's see what we can do.
[03:37:08.101 --> 03:37:09.121]  Let's see what happens.
[03:37:11.067 --> 03:37:18.129]  If we have the bold leadership we need to push back before it's too late in January.
[03:37:18.509 --> 03:37:21.730]  Think about gridlock, you know, and the kind of compromises that will be made.
[03:37:22.330 --> 03:37:24.471]  Some will be good, some maybe not so good.
[03:37:24.891 --> 03:37:33.313]  Maybe nothing meaningful will happen again for a couple years, which given the way things have rolled up, that really wouldn't surprise me.
[03:37:34.014 --> 03:37:37.855]  I'm looking at my notes from today and I want to talk about
[03:37:40.282 --> 03:38:03.574]  What you'll see over the next couple of years, if we don't push it back now, in terms of personal privacy, transparency in government, the idea of being able to stay on the track that we've been on, that's created the most vibrant economy in modern history and many, many people's lifetimes, as a matter of fact.
[03:38:04.454 --> 03:38:09.917]  But think about that right now, because that's what's at stake right now.
[03:38:11.285 --> 03:38:39.913]  Is that economy and there's some things that I think we need to remember to about Just stagnation, you know change maybe is good in some arenas, but the kind of change in trajectory we've been on has been the most aggressive we've seen forever, but privacy transparency And and true ability to maintain our free speech are the critical elements of
[03:38:41.225 --> 03:38:42.148]  Of this generation.
[03:38:42.208 --> 03:38:44.015]  If we don't do it, now's the time.
[03:38:44.055 --> 03:38:46.162]  We're literally at five minutes to midnight.
[03:38:46.747 --> 03:38:48.808]  The House is going to change in January.
[03:38:50.029 --> 03:38:59.314]  Protect freedom, personal privacy, and the right for all of us to communicate equally on the platforms that represent modern technology.
[03:38:59.815 --> 03:39:11.542]  You know, when I think about Alex and where InfoWars started, for those that remember, you know, it was on public access channels, you know, and Alex
[03:39:12.282 --> 03:39:19.707]  He worked and scraped his program together and built a team and a network that is effective.
[03:39:21.087 --> 03:39:32.914]  And that was the point of Alex's last segment was that combination of the truth, lawyers out there that are willing to engage it and jump in.
[03:39:34.733 --> 03:39:39.674]  To the Infowar, quite frankly, and be heard and make a difference.
[03:39:39.894 --> 03:39:40.914]  And that's what's happened.
[03:39:40.934 --> 03:39:46.815]  And that's why the pushback has been so extreme by the other side these days.
[03:39:47.536 --> 03:39:50.256]  So, you know, I mean, I think about the elections.
[03:39:50.296 --> 03:39:53.577]  A lot was gained in terms of lessons learned.
[03:39:53.617 --> 03:40:00.258]  But now really is the 11th hour and we have to regain the freedom of speech and debate.
[03:40:01.525 --> 03:40:03.426]  Before we go into this next two years.
[03:40:04.587 --> 03:40:18.377]  You know, the other issues I want to get into today, I want to talk a little bit about, again, taking a broader vision for America, the United States right now, and things that can be done.
[03:40:18.858 --> 03:40:25.943]  Because a lot can be done regardless, through the executive, through regulation, through executive order, with or without the Congress.
[03:40:26.750 --> 03:40:29.051]  As we saw during the Obama administration.
[03:40:29.592 --> 03:40:46.420]  So, I mean, there's on balance some things the executive can do within his authority and within the Constitution and things the legislative bodies can do after the new legislature is sworn in in January.
[03:40:46.540 --> 03:40:48.561]  And in the meantime, there's a lot to be done.
[03:40:49.342 --> 03:40:53.504]  You know, when I think about, again, the issue of
[03:40:55.291 --> 03:40:56.692]  Reality creation.
[03:40:56.732 --> 03:41:17.900]  I mean, think about where people get their news and the channeling of that news being now imposed on even a broader way by the big players in communications on the planet today, in terms of how people really communicate, socialize or what have you.
[03:41:18.380 --> 03:41:23.762]  I mean, think about how people's time use has moved
[03:41:24.577 --> 03:41:36.043]  Into a venue where everything about you can be understood and seen in such a way that the pushback is the total invasion of your privacy.
[03:41:36.783 --> 03:41:45.647]  You know, at InfoWars, at the InfoWarsStore.com, they carry my books and videos, and there's two that are really important on these issues.
[03:41:45.667 --> 03:41:50.870]  And they were written a while ago, and they were forecast for the future, the future we're having now.
[03:41:51.630 --> 03:41:52.010]  Okay?
[03:41:53.797 --> 03:41:58.842]  Earth Rising, Earth Rising 2, both at infowarestore.com in the bookstore.
[03:41:59.542 --> 03:42:05.388]  When you go that route, you really support Alex and the network, and I appreciate it also.
[03:42:05.428 --> 03:42:06.329]  It supports my work.
[03:42:06.949 --> 03:42:11.714]  But when you look at privacy and what we saw coming, and then sort of how it all came,
[03:42:12.294 --> 03:42:26.593]  Through control of various aspects of entertainment, media, really shaping and pushing the direction in which all of us have been headed over the last 25 years.
[03:42:26.873 --> 03:42:30.398]  It's now a quarter of a century of this work.
[03:42:31.508 --> 03:42:34.090]  You know, I hear music kicking in.
[03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:38.313]  I know we're coming into a break, and we're going to be back in a few minutes.
[03:42:38.333 --> 03:42:41.114]  You're listening to Dr. Nick Feggish on InfoWars.com.
[03:42:41.154 --> 03:42:43.856]  Check us out at EarthPulse.com.
[03:42:43.896 --> 03:42:45.037]  This is Dr. Nick Feggish.
[03:42:45.077 --> 03:42:45.857]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:47.418 --> 03:42:53.743]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[03:42:57.714 --> 03:43:03.718]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[03:43:04.079 --> 03:43:06.681]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[03:43:07.301 --> 03:43:10.744]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:43:11.004 --> 03:43:15.267]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:43:15.707 --> 03:43:18.949]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:43:19.870 --> 03:43:30.096]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:43:30.856 --> 03:43:39.401]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[03:43:41.022 --> 03:43:49.585]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[03:43:50.085 --> 03:43:54.506]  Try Bodies today at InfoWarsLife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[03:43:54.606 --> 03:44:07.430]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:09.871]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[03:44:11.835 --> 03:44:20.823]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasting radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:44:21.183 --> 03:44:27.388]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[03:44:27.889 --> 03:44:32.713]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[03:44:33.133 --> 03:44:34.074]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:44:34.474 --> 03:44:36.555]  Not so fast, InfoWars.
[03:44:36.915 --> 03:44:39.736]  Apple banned your app.
[03:44:40.676 --> 03:44:42.817]  I helped, too!
[03:44:43.117 --> 03:44:44.138]  Oh, Oliver.
[03:44:44.498 --> 03:44:48.680]  I hate free speech, too!
[03:44:48.740 --> 03:44:50.740]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:50.820 --> 03:44:53.902]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:53.982 --> 03:44:55.682]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:55.842 --> 03:44:57.503]  We hate free speech!
[03:45:01.846 --> 03:45:09.116]  I do want to remind you that here at InfoWars, we are completely and totally listener and viewer supported.
[03:45:09.616 --> 03:45:16.606]  So I want you to go to the InfoWars.com site right now and see some of the extraordinary specials that we are carrying.
[03:45:16.786 --> 03:45:27.953]  Without your loyal support, without your buying these products, whether they're the Great Nutraceuticals, or our t-shirts, or our books, or any of our products, we literally cannot continue the fight.
[03:45:27.973 --> 03:45:34.237]  Now, if you are not in the market for one of our Great Nutraceuticals, and we've got some unbelievable sales, Silver Bullet is 67% off.
[03:45:35.598 --> 03:45:36.639]  This is one of my favorites.
[03:46:05.858 --> 03:46:09.040]  This gives me mental clarity, mental energy.
[03:46:09.200 --> 03:46:10.921]  This is an extraordinary product.
[03:46:11.061 --> 03:46:11.961]  I highly recommend it.
[03:46:12.041 --> 03:46:20.205]  And of course, you can grab a copy of my new book, Stone's Rules, at a very nice price on the Infowars.com site.
[03:46:20.365 --> 03:46:23.547]  All of those great products help fund the fight for freedom.
[03:46:23.687 --> 03:46:27.869]  We are completely and totally reliant on you in the fight ahead.
[03:46:28.129 --> 03:46:34.033]  It is not incidental that InfoWars has been at the focal point in the war of censorship.
[03:46:34.453 --> 03:46:39.816]  It is not incidental that we have been banned across all platforms on the same day.
[03:46:40.217 --> 03:46:41.117]  That's racketeering!
[03:46:41.457 --> 03:46:44.719]  That's the real collusion they don't want you to know about.
[03:46:44.859 --> 03:46:47.361]  This is an effort to destroy what Alex Jones has built.
[03:46:47.441 --> 03:46:48.762]  Don't let them get away with it.
[03:46:48.822 --> 03:46:50.803]  Go to the InfoWars.com store right now.
[03:46:51.163 --> 03:46:53.565]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll be right back.
[03:47:01.879 --> 03:47:04.495]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.882 --> 03:47:29.209]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:33.594 --> 03:47:35.656]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[03:47:35.676 --> 03:47:39.620]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and I'm standing in in this last hour on a Friday.
[03:47:40.201 --> 03:47:44.165]  I want to shift gears a little bit here, and I want to talk
[03:47:45.353 --> 03:47:51.877]  About another important area that is always a part of the subject matter on InfoWars is China right now.
[03:47:52.497 --> 03:48:09.067]  And I talked to one of my friends, my buddy has traveled, most travel guy I know, over 140 countries, several of them a lot of times, including China, from the early 1980s to this last year, so spanning a pretty good amount of time.
[03:48:09.107 --> 03:48:11.429]  And he's been there four times, China alone.
[03:48:12.029 --> 03:48:13.030]  So, I'm talking to him.
[03:48:13.050 --> 03:48:14.351]  We have an ongoing conversation.
[03:48:14.391 --> 03:48:17.254]  I have a conversation with a lot of people, a lot of places around the world.
[03:48:17.534 --> 03:48:22.439]  And with my friend, his last trip to China is observations.
[03:48:22.999 --> 03:48:26.182]  And look at where China sits on the Pacific Rim.
[03:48:27.919 --> 03:48:36.023]  It went from bicycles from the early 80s and a few cars all the way over to automobiles and mopeds, right?
[03:48:36.363 --> 03:48:43.006]  Now, on the screen is a map showing the Pacific Rim, and you can see its relationship directionally from the United States.
[03:48:43.066 --> 03:48:46.867]  And look at where Alaska sits and that chain of islands that sits out there.
[03:48:47.668 --> 03:48:57.032]  How close we are to Korea, Japan, China, Australia, even, you know, when you think about the Pacific Rim as a trading belt.
[03:48:57.492 --> 03:49:07.559]  Well, most of the trade now is happening in India, China, Asia, and Alaska, situated ideally.
[03:49:07.599 --> 03:49:20.628]  And if you look at the map of just Alaska, Canada, and the United States for a moment, and look at how far apart Alaska is from the rest of the United States.
[03:49:20.708 --> 03:49:25.571]  You know, it's a 1,500-mile trip by air from Anchorage to Seattle.
[03:49:27.324 --> 03:49:29.626]  You know, that's just to get to the next state.
[03:49:30.226 --> 03:49:36.391]  OK, but then look at the size proportionally of Alaska and recognize a couple of things.
[03:49:36.831 --> 03:49:53.884]  Firstly, if you take all of Alaska's coastline from southeast all the way down the Aleutian chain, all around the top of the state, the whole coastline is bigger than the entire West Coast, East Coast and Gulf Coast to the United States.
[03:49:54.685 --> 03:49:55.386]  Combined.
[03:49:55.667 --> 03:49:55.987]  Okay.
[03:49:56.528 --> 03:50:08.748]  And if you think about Alaska, if you look at the map again on the screen, Alaska, South Central Alaska, and a little bit in the south eastern quarter is where all the roads virtually are.
[03:50:09.258 --> 03:50:10.999]  The rest of the state is empty space.
[03:50:11.899 --> 03:50:16.140]  As an example, Alaska is 20% of the land mass.
[03:50:16.200 --> 03:50:23.062]  If Alaska had 20% of the population, we'd have about, what, 65 million people?
[03:50:23.182 --> 03:50:23.562]  We don't.
[03:50:23.762 --> 03:50:24.082]  We have 750,000.
[03:50:24.143 --> 03:50:27.744]  Seattle has more people.
[03:50:27.884 --> 03:50:30.945]  Most big cities on the West Coast have more people.
[03:50:31.005 --> 03:50:34.126]  Most of Alaska is really wilderness.
[03:50:34.146 --> 03:50:37.647]  Looking at the Google map, looking for roads, you won't find many.
[03:50:38.047 --> 03:50:38.887]  Because there aren't any.
[03:50:39.392 --> 03:50:39.632]  All right.
[03:50:58.963 --> 03:51:02.931]  They're a huge landmass with tremendous natural resources of all kinds.
[03:51:02.951 --> 03:51:06.598]  They produce most of the rare earth minerals, like 90% in the world.
[03:51:07.079 --> 03:51:09.023]  A lot of strategic minerals they produce.
[03:51:09.043 --> 03:51:10.305]  And what they don't produce
[03:51:11.371 --> 03:51:38.572]  They've gone to Africa and Latin America and throughout Asia and created relationships and moved millions of their people and population to these these areas of the world to develop mines and smelters and shipping and ports and infrastructure and roads and railroads etc etc throughout the world to move commodities into their country.
[03:51:39.918 --> 03:51:45.081]  And store huge amounts of surpluses of most commodities that they don't have access of.
[03:51:45.121 --> 03:51:46.922]  When the prices are low, they stockpile.
[03:51:47.403 --> 03:51:49.244]  They convert U.S.
[03:51:49.324 --> 03:51:51.305]  treasuries and U.S.
[03:51:51.365 --> 03:51:59.270]  currency and all the trade notes, our deficits, get converted into real stuff, you know?
[03:51:59.790 --> 03:52:07.875]  And what they don't have and they can't make, they go out and buy it somewhere in the world, even if they have to pay a premium.
[03:52:08.567 --> 03:52:14.849]  Outbid the West, they'll pay 10, 15% over, even when a market says something's worth, and people go, why would they do that?
[03:52:16.050 --> 03:52:24.493]  Because holding the treasuries, that relative to values of dollars, inflation, all those factors, over time decreases anyway.
[03:52:25.673 --> 03:52:33.096]  So dump all this stuff, and get real stuff, that over the long run, goes the other direction, appreciates.
[03:52:33.576 --> 03:52:36.197]  Because it's real value, they're commodities, real value.
[03:52:37.081 --> 03:52:39.442]  Real economic value.
[03:52:39.602 --> 03:52:43.704]  Currency is just the fiction in between, you know?
[03:52:44.164 --> 03:52:46.324]  The trade in between the paper.
[03:52:46.905 --> 03:52:49.766]  The paper isn't where it's at, and the Chinese realize it.
[03:52:49.786 --> 03:52:53.307]  And that's where we have fallen behind.
[03:52:53.427 --> 03:53:04.311]  And for the challenge for the next administration, you know, when the Obama administration tried to stimulate the economy, I called it the biggest repaving program in the history of America.
[03:53:05.197 --> 03:53:07.378]  Project ready, project ready.
[03:53:07.478 --> 03:53:09.059]  What a bunch of nonsense.
[03:53:09.099 --> 03:53:15.002]  We went into debt up to our eyeballs building meaningless infrastructure on so many levels.
[03:53:16.162 --> 03:53:18.744]  And what is meaningful infrastructure?
[03:53:19.344 --> 03:53:23.326]  It's roads to natural resources.
[03:53:24.506 --> 03:53:28.868]  It's like creating an airport next to your treasury.
[03:53:30.849 --> 03:53:31.910]  You might want to move
[03:53:32.935 --> 03:53:36.079]  The Treasury somewhere, someday.
[03:53:36.459 --> 03:53:38.622]  And Alaska is it.
[03:53:38.802 --> 03:53:40.144]  And here's what's happening here right now.
[03:53:41.105 --> 03:53:50.517]  This week was the Miners' Convention, happens every year, and a lot of people come and present what they're developing and what's coming online.
[03:53:50.637 --> 03:53:51.458]  And there are
[03:53:52.581 --> 03:53:55.703]  Huge, huge projects coming online.
[03:53:56.203 --> 03:54:06.269]  But the sad and roads being built with state resources combined with industry, they're building a couple hundred miles of roads to one copper deposit up north.
[03:54:06.630 --> 03:54:07.550]  But they're doing things.
[03:54:07.610 --> 03:54:11.733]  And my view is railroads to riches.
[03:54:11.813 --> 03:54:13.594]  And the reason I say that is
[03:54:14.429 --> 03:54:36.101]  You know, we have an opportunity in Alaska and in the United States to build railroad links that connect these mineral belts and oil and gas fields and areas to the rest of the national capital base, which is all the factories and all the potential.
[03:54:36.481 --> 03:54:41.084]  But we have to have a rail link that hooks us to the Canadian rail system so that we can move commodities
[03:54:42.128 --> 03:54:42.508]  I think so.
[03:55:09.700 --> 03:55:10.280]  We're good to go.
[03:55:10.320 --> 03:55:11.220]  We're good to go.
[03:55:11.240 --> 03:55:12.080]  We're good to go.
[03:55:12.100 --> 03:55:12.501]  We're good to go.
[03:55:12.561 --> 03:55:13.621]  We're good to go.
[03:55:13.641 --> 03:55:14.701]  We're good to go.
[03:55:14.721 --> 03:55:15.121]  We're good to go.
[03:55:15.141 --> 03:55:15.521]  We're good to go.
[03:55:15.561 --> 03:55:16.181]  We're good to go.
[03:55:16.201 --> 03:55:17.261]  We're good to go.
[03:55:17.301 --> 03:55:17.821]  We're good to go.
[03:55:18.242 --> 03:55:18.762]  We're good to go.
[03:55:18.802 --> 03:55:19.362]  We're good to go.
[03:55:19.382 --> 03:55:19.782]  We're good to go.
[03:55:19.802 --> 03:55:20.162]  We're good to go.
[03:55:20.182 --> 03:55:20.802]  We're good to go.
[03:55:20.882 --> 03:55:21.522]  We're good to go.
[03:55:21.562 --> 03:55:22.042]  We're good to go.
[03:55:22.062 --> 03:55:22.422]  We're good to go.
[03:55:22.462 --> 03:55:23.302]  We're good to go.
[03:55:23.362 --> 03:55:24.403]  We're good to go.
[03:55:24.423 --> 03:55:25.463]  We're good to go.
[03:55:25.503 --> 03:55:26.043]  We're good to go.
[03:55:26.083 --> 03:55:26.643]  We're good to go.
[03:55:26.683 --> 03:55:27.103]  We're good to go.
[03:55:27.123 --> 03:55:28.323]  We're good to go.
[03:55:28.583 --> 03:55:29.123]  We're good to go.
[03:55:29.143 --> 03:55:29.744]  We're good to go.
[03:55:29.764 --> 03:55:30.544]  We're good to go.
[03:55:30.564 --> 03:55:31.244]  We're good to go.
[03:55:31.264 --> 03:55:31.924]  We're good to go.
[03:55:31.964 --> 03:55:33.064]  We're good to go.
[03:55:33.104 --> 03:55:33.444]  We're good to go.
[03:55:33.464 --> 03:55:34.384]  We're good to go.
[03:55:34.844 --> 03:55:35.525]  We're good to go.
[03:55:35.625 --> 03:55:36.305]  We're good to go.
[03:55:36.345 --> 03:55:37.025]  We're good to go.
[03:55:37.105 --> 03:55:37.325]  We're
[03:55:38.414 --> 03:55:38.775]  All right.
[03:55:50.308 --> 03:55:50.628]  What's
[03:56:09.005 --> 03:56:15.389]  Six or seven years in prototypes, and now they're building their first production facility in Ketchikan, Alaska.
[03:56:15.789 --> 03:56:35.919]  You know, when you think about other things that are important with 21st century, copper, zinc, of course, cobalt, titanium, tungsten, iron, all of these things are in huge, huge quantities in Alaska, and several mines are in advanced stages of permitting, headed into development.
[03:56:36.039 --> 03:56:37.980]  And this is exciting stuff.
[03:56:38.441 --> 03:56:44.255]  But once you move off of tidewater, the logistics start to move away from you pretty quickly.
[03:56:44.275 --> 03:56:46.340]  And this is where we have an opportunity now.
[03:56:47.469 --> 03:56:52.130]  To build roads, railroads and ports to move these natural resources to U.S.
[03:56:52.210 --> 03:56:56.932]  markets where they can be made into things and value added and exported again.
[03:56:57.372 --> 03:57:02.473]  The big changes are coming in robotics, which is going to drive industry in the 21st century.
[03:57:03.213 --> 03:57:09.055]  The next time I'm on, I want to talk about robotics and the impact that's coming.
[03:57:10.434 --> 03:57:21.639]  This is huge, and it's going to cause the biggest displacement in labor and the workforce as a factor of economic production in the history of mankind.
[03:57:21.759 --> 03:57:22.639]  And it's upon us.
[03:57:22.959 --> 03:57:27.541]  It's coming in this century, much of it in our lifetimes.
[03:57:28.732 --> 03:57:32.795]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and you've been listening to InfoWars.com.
[03:57:32.835 --> 03:57:39.059]  Check me out, also at EarthPulse, E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E, EarthPulse.com.
[03:57:39.559 --> 03:57:42.641]  It's always a pleasure to be with you, and we're at the end of the hour.
[03:57:43.642 --> 03:57:46.444]  It goes by fast, InfoWars.com.
[03:57:46.984 --> 03:57:48.665]  Talk to you all next week.
[03:57:52.372 --> 03:57:59.638]  I do want to remind you that here at InfoWars, we are completely and totally listener and viewer supported.
[03:58:00.139 --> 03:58:07.145]  So I want you to go to the InfoWars.com site right now and see some of the extraordinary specials that we are carrying.
[03:58:07.325 --> 03:58:08.626]  Without your loyal support,
[03:58:08.886 --> 03:58:18.479]  Without your buying these products, whether they're the great nutraceuticals, or our t-shirts, or our books, or any of our products, we literally cannot continue the fight.
[03:58:18.499 --> 03:58:24.787]  Now, if you are not in the market for one of our great nutraceuticals, and we've got some unbelievable sales, Silver Bullet at 67% off.
[03:58:26.129 --> 03:58:27.190]  This is one of my favorites.
[03:58:27.290 --> 03:58:30.831]  The finest colloidal silver product I think in the country.
[03:58:30.931 --> 03:58:45.177]  We use a special electronic process which provides for a smaller microbe and therefore greater absorbability of the colloidal silver known for centuries as one of the most effective antiviral and antibacterial compounds.
[03:58:45.337 --> 03:58:46.478]  I use it whenever I feel
[03:58:46.698 --> 03:58:49.324]  A cold coming on, and I highly recommend it.
[03:58:49.425 --> 03:58:53.273]  Brain Force Plus, which works extraordinarily well for me.
[03:58:53.554 --> 03:58:56.200]  You're looking at 50% off with free shipping.
[03:58:56.421 --> 03:58:59.488]  This gives me mental clarity, mental energy.
