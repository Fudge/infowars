[00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:37.982]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are on this Friday, the 28th day of September 2018, 39 days out from this incredibly historic, critical election.
[00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:47.326]  And you have seen the hysteria, the deception, the lies, the leaking, the fraud, the doxing, all of it from the Democrats on display with Kavanaugh.
[00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.326]  And here's the big breaking news.
[00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:57.030]  As of last night with Town Hall and as of today with Reuters and Politico and others, they're having to admit it right now.
[00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.431]  The Republicans have the votes in the U.S.
[00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:04.335]  Senate to seat Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.
[00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:20.710]  But it's very, very important for people to understand that they are only trying to pile more garbage on and intensify the crises and that no one's ever going to get confirmed after this if we put up with this type of
[00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:25.658]  This destruction of due process, this destruction of innocent until proven guilty.
[00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:38.147]  If you go back and look at previous confirmation votes by Republicans for Democrat members of the Supreme Court, you're talking 70, 80, 90% of the Republicans voting to confirm.
[00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:43.011]  And it's the Democrats going back to Robert Bork, always trying to obstruct and block.
[00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:48.215]  But now they're voting 100% along party lines against Kavanaugh.
[00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:49.076]  They've said they are.
[00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.418]  And it's disgusting, they're double standards.
[00:01:52.438 --> 00:01:57.160]  You have Bill Clinton and others involved in real sex crimes, pedophilia, raping, you name it.
[00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:03.323]  I mean, we're talking about Lolita Express aircraft, we're talking about little girls, we're talking about rape islands.
[00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:15.209]  And then, oh my gosh, 36 years ago, Brett Kavanaugh is this big, giant, evil demon.
[00:02:16.343 --> 00:02:18.844]  Brett Kavanaugh is the worst person on earth.
[00:02:19.664 --> 00:02:26.267]  Somebody fell on a bed 36 years ago, but then he can't even prove it, and all the witnesses say, what is being said isn't true.
[00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:36.651]  And it turns out that Sheila Jackson Lee was handing stationary to the lawyer, the deep state lawyer for Ms.
[00:02:37.132 --> 00:02:45.115]  Ford, Dr. Ford, who is also the lawyer for the deep state heads of the FBI, deputy head of the FBI, like Andy McCabe.
[00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.315]  Turns out that's not a payoff.
[00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:49.878]  They say it was stationary.
[00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:50.939]  I'm sure it's true.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.486]  What about the $750,000 and counting that she's raised on
[00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:01.824]  Just two different crowdfunding situations.
[00:03:02.124 --> 00:03:03.105]  Which, okay, great.
[00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:05.887]  But you go and you make this unsubstantiated claim.
[00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:08.669]  She'll probably raise two, three million by the time this is all over.
[00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.713]  But they won't even let Infowars on any of the Patreon or the Kickstart or any of it.
[00:03:15.013 --> 00:03:17.114]  Or really, any other conservatives for that matter.
[00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:18.956]  This is the racketeering
[00:03:19.696 --> 00:03:35.541]  We've seen just like it's come out the Justice Department and the IRS is still targeting Christians and conservatives for harassment and the latest Project Veritas undercover video is them talking about at the IRS how they persecute Christians and conservatives and Trump supporters.
[00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:41.243]  This is an outrageous group of people hell-bent on bullying and dominating.
[00:03:41.483 --> 00:03:43.124]  This is gang warfare.
[00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:49.894]  They are the individuals that have hijacked the institutions and have run up the flags of piracy against us.
[00:03:51.035 --> 00:04:02.703]  So when we come back, Lindsey Graham I've had big problems with because he's a creature of John McCain, but he's gotten so much better since McCain made the jump into hyperspace, or Hades, you take your pick.
[00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.227]  And he was on fire yesterday.
[00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:06.407]  He's been the strongest so far.
[00:04:06.727 --> 00:04:08.428]  Ted Cruz just finished speaking.
[00:04:08.808 --> 00:04:10.289]  We're going to have that for you on the other side.
[00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.610]  David Knight's going to be joining us.
[00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.931]  We're going to have Roger Stone coming up later.
[00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:17.172]  We're going to obviously have Owen Schroer riding shotgun with me.
[00:04:17.753 --> 00:04:20.174]  And then, of course, Nick Begich will be on during the fourth hour.
[00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:21.054]  Always love Dr. Nick Begich.
[00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:26.577]  But if the vote's going on then, because we're not sure what's going to happen today, we may have to preempt that, because we're going to have coverage of this.
[00:04:26.597 --> 00:04:28.198]  You can tune in to these local stations.
[00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:32.620]  You can tune in to InfoWars.com, and you're going to get Kavanaugh coverage.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.084]  And you're going to get coverage of the Chi-Coms trying to start a war in the South China Sea.
[00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:38.426]  And you're going to get it all.
[00:04:39.026 --> 00:04:42.870]  Now whatever you do, remember the scumbags are trying to shut us down and are waging war on InfoWars.
[00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.373]  So it's an act of defiance and pure Americana.
[00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:50.418]  Defensive liberty when you spread NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and InfoWars.com.
[00:04:53.323 --> 00:05:09.570]  Imagine 20 years ago if I would have told you that in 2018 a Nazi collaborator, George Soros, would be in control of our media, our government, and that anybody that criticized him would be banned from the internet and even banned from commerce and being able to process credit cards.
[00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:18.814]  Well, Soros bought control of PayPal last month, and even though we've been working with PayPal for 20 years, they banned us with the magic word, hate speech.
[00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:22.236]  Now, if that was a Nazi collaborator like Soros, he'd be okay.
[00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:24.774]  That's how crazy all this is.
[00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:29.756]  So they're betting that you're just going to put up with the abuse, like conservatives always do, and just go away.
[00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:34.237]  But the biggest thing you can do is call Congress, call the White House, call talk radio.
[00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:36.858]  Make a big deal out of this, because other conservatives are next.
[00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:37.518]  It's already happening.
[00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:44.100]  And with our regular credit card processes we have at InfoWarsTore.com, get in there and get some of the amazing products we've got.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.021]  So you can't lose.
[00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:49.042]  You get great products while you're funding the information war at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:49.302 --> 00:05:52.863]  You can let that old Nazi collaborator Soros tell you to shove it up as you know what.
[00:05:55.851 --> 00:05:57.972]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:03.674]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:23.261 --> 00:06:24.061]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:29.192]  We are broadcasting worldwide with 39 days out from the midterms.
[00:06:30.453 --> 00:06:31.653]  Right now it could change.
[00:06:31.693 --> 00:06:34.634]  The Republicans have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
[00:06:35.415 --> 00:06:39.456]  The Democrats are never going to let him get confirmed if they wait any longer.
[00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:43.678]  They'll have a hundred more women, five hundred women, a thousand women.
[00:06:43.938 --> 00:06:49.380]  They'll have sports stadiums with a hundred thousand all saying that he blew their brains out.
[00:06:50.191 --> 00:06:51.952]  I mean, it'll just be insane.
[00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:54.592]  They try to get Barrett in.
[00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:59.574]  They'll say she wears cat lady outfits and rapes women with bull whips and is a vampire.
[00:07:00.134 --> 00:07:02.774]  I mean, they're not going to stop, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:06.896]  They are using the IRS to still persecute Christians and conservatives.
[00:07:07.236 --> 00:07:09.076]  Project Veritas got undercover video of that.
[00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:14.578]  They are doxing members of Congress and their families right now.
[00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:19.967]  And you can do a search on Wikipedia to see where it was updated from.
[00:07:20.287 --> 00:07:30.933]  They are doxing members of the Senate who are pro-Kavanaugh and their families, their wives, their homes, their phone numbers, their addresses from the House of Representatives.
[00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:33.595]  So inside the other side of the Capitol building.
[00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:37.529]  Insiders are their doxing people.
[00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:39.630]  This is what terrorism is.
[00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.610]  They are terrorizing everyone.
[00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.451]  They are bullying everyone.
[00:07:43.751 --> 00:07:50.673]  They're saying, go out in public and if they're associated with Trump, don't let them eat in restaurants, don't let them go to the mall.
[00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:54.614]  You get in there facing a mob and you run their ass out of there.
[00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.655]  The Democratic Party is a sellout party to the Communist Chinese and others.
[00:08:00.776 --> 00:08:03.500]  Their religion is hating America and hating unborn.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.843]  They are a legion of evil.
[00:08:06.745 --> 00:08:09.048]  They are conscious, lying criminals.
[00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.434]  They have radicalized the party, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:16.095]  Because fish rot from the head down.
[00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:37.611]  Last night I watched a TR documentary about Stalin, and I already knew about it, but just to watch it and see it, how evil the communists were, and how much they enjoyed hurting poor Christians, and stealing their land and their property, and murdering them, and just how much they enjoyed it, because they hated God, and Stalin said, I serve Lucifer, I worship the devil.
[00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:40.453]  And people always said, oh, he's just joking, and he said, no!
[00:08:42.116 --> 00:08:42.976]  I believe in God.
[00:08:43.176 --> 00:08:46.358]  I believe in the devil and he's giving me power and I'm gonna kill people.
[00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:48.078]  And V.I.
[00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.899]  Lenin was a devil worshipper as well.
[00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:55.701]  So, you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that these people mean business and they hate you and your family.
[00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:59.762]  And communists in this country went and set up V.I.
[00:08:59.782 --> 00:09:00.083]  Lenin and
[00:09:02.287 --> 00:09:02.687]  Stalin.
[00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:07.069]  That was leftist creation out of America.
[00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.810]  And they want to do that to you and your family.
[00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.831]  Make no mistake.
[00:09:12.131 --> 00:09:19.095]  Their religion is literally raping your wife and children in front of you, and then working you to death, and then shooting you in the back of the head.
[00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:25.838]  That's where Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Michael Moore and George Soros want to take you.
[00:09:27.178 --> 00:09:28.859]  Look at Antifa beating up women and children.
[00:09:31.815 --> 00:09:33.036]  It's who they are.
[00:09:33.096 --> 00:09:35.838]  They have a hunger for your life.
[00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:37.399]  They want to dominate you.
[00:09:37.499 --> 00:09:39.141]  Now, here's the incredible news.
[00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:42.443]  And there's so much of it.
[00:09:42.483 --> 00:09:43.084]  Bombshell.
[00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:49.469]  Senate prosecutor says, she briefed the senators last night, she wouldn't charge Kavanaugh or even pursue a search warrant.
[00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:51.330]  She said it's totally incredible.
[00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.291]  There's no witnesses.
[00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:53.892]  None of the story adds up.
[00:09:54.412 --> 00:09:55.693]  The whole thing's disintegrated.
[00:09:56.114 --> 00:09:58.716]  And she wouldn't even get near a court with this.
[00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:07.878]  Continuing, with support for key GOP Senator, Judiciary Committee sets favorable vote for Kavanaugh.
[00:10:08.118 --> 00:10:09.459]  NBC News.
[00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:11.802]  And they're set to vote sometime later today.
[00:10:12.282 --> 00:10:21.391]  That is, of course, now getting more and more of the key holdover Republicans to say they're getting on board, like Jeff Flake, Republican Arizona.
[00:10:22.392 --> 00:10:23.472]  Maybe he can redeem himself.
[00:10:24.032 --> 00:10:25.353]  Tears and raw fury.
[00:10:25.413 --> 00:10:29.074]  Kavanaugh hearing makes for riveting television.
[00:10:29.094 --> 00:10:30.214]  We're going to play some of the highlights.
[00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:31.634]  I thought he was very credible.
[00:10:32.135 --> 00:10:35.055]  Emotional Kavanaugh decries circus and maintains innocence.
[00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:38.936]  As Ford testifies, he sexually assaulted me.
[00:10:41.877 --> 00:10:44.118]  Men are trash versus I stand with Brett.
[00:10:44.178 --> 00:10:46.278]  Wild scene at the Capitol for Kavanaugh drama.
[00:10:46.698 --> 00:10:47.739]  That is Politico.
[00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:48.719]  We'll get to those videos.
[00:10:50.587 --> 00:10:51.768]  And so much more.
[00:10:51.848 --> 00:10:54.210]  Senator Bob Corker to vote yes on Kavanaugh.
[00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.252]  Nothing corroborates the allegations.
[00:10:57.973 --> 00:10:58.794]  You see what's happening?
[00:10:59.827 --> 00:11:04.848]  Lindsey Graham is chased down the hall, screamed at, yelled at, frothed at, like these women want to kill him.
[00:11:05.388 --> 00:11:07.148]  No one's calling for them to be arrested or thrown out.
[00:11:07.348 --> 00:11:07.868]  I'm not either.
[00:11:08.309 --> 00:11:20.751]  But I talked one-tenth as aggressively to CNN reporters and Marco Rubio, and mainstream media said I should be taken off the air everywhere and I should be banned from the Capitol because I dare walk up and ask a few tough questions.
[00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:24.591]  Again, just shows how these people are out of control.
[00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:26.832]  And as I mentioned, Republican senators doxxed
[00:11:27.768 --> 00:11:30.849]  By someone in house shortly after questioning Kavanaugh.
[00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.730]  It's all coming up.
[00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:38.093]  But first, let's go to Senator Cruz just minutes ago.
[00:11:38.153 --> 00:11:38.693]  Here it is.
[00:11:40.454 --> 00:11:41.294]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[00:11:44.216 --> 00:11:45.556]  We're living in a divided time.
[00:11:47.597 --> 00:11:49.578]  This country is divided right down the middle.
[00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:52.860]  There is an enormous amount of anger.
[00:11:54.481 --> 00:11:55.241]  There's rage.
[00:11:56.602 --> 00:11:57.262]  There's hatred.
[00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:06.487]  We see demonstrators screaming at each other, reflecting that rage, reflecting that anger.
[00:12:06.507 --> 00:12:18.511]  And I know there are a great many Americans who wish we could, and believe we can, get back to an environment where we treat each other with civility and decency.
[00:12:19.758 --> 00:12:30.503]  Get back to an environment where, yes, we have policy disagreements, we disagree on what the right legislation is to pass, and we even have vigorous debates about what the right policy is.
[00:12:31.703 --> 00:12:45.570]  But we do so in a context that respects each other, that doesn't demean the humanity of each other, that doesn't attack the character and drag people through the mud.
[00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:57.452]  The politics of personal destruction that we have seen on display in recent days is Washington D.C.
[00:12:57.472 --> 00:12:58.292]  at its very ugliest.
[00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:04.754]  And all of us should remember that we're talking about real human beings here.
[00:13:06.294 --> 00:13:08.054]  These aren't pawns on a chessboard.
[00:13:08.074 --> 00:13:09.274]  These are real people.
[00:13:10.695 --> 00:13:12.615]  Dr. Ford has been through hell.
[00:13:14.436 --> 00:13:16.216]  The last two weeks I have no doubt
[00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:21.201]  Have been extraordinarily painful for her, for her family.
[00:13:23.783 --> 00:13:26.124]  The testimony she gave yesterday was powerful.
[00:13:26.384 --> 00:13:27.645]  And the millions of dollars she's raising?
[00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:28.265]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.266]  Was clearly heart-wrenching.
[00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:33.488]  Was clear she was hurting and hurting mightily.
[00:13:34.609 --> 00:13:42.914]  Having her name made public, against her wishes, and dragged through the mud,
[00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:46.184]  Was a hurtful thing to do.
[00:13:46.544 --> 00:13:50.006]  Yeah, that's what Harry Feinstein said.
[00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:51.687]  Everything he says turns out to not be true though.
[00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:58.971]  He too has been dragged through the mud for the last two weeks in a way that has no precedence.
[00:14:05.014 --> 00:14:09.057]  In our polarized society we live in today, it's almost tribalized.
[00:14:11.152 --> 00:14:17.413]  Where half of us wear one team's jersey, the other half wear the other team's jersey, and everything we see, we see through the lens of our jersey.
[00:14:18.994 --> 00:14:34.077]  So if we're not surprised, if across the country, a significant percentage of those on the Democratic side of the aisle saw yesterday's testimony and concluded
[00:14:35.543 --> 00:14:36.424]  He must be guilty.
[00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:45.829]  And it would not surprise me if a very significant percentage of those on the Republican side of the aisle saw yesterday's testimony, the same testimony, and concluded he must be innocent.
[00:14:46.289 --> 00:14:49.151]  Folks, the New York Times apologized for saying that you find her credible.
[00:14:49.571 --> 00:14:51.713]  That's what you always ask about a trial or a hearing.
[00:14:53.454 --> 00:14:54.815]  You can't even question now.
[00:14:54.835 --> 00:15:00.618]  This country is crippled with political correctness.
[00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:04.080]  She's a political Democrat operative whose story is phony.
[00:15:05.825 --> 00:15:08.106]  About who our witnesses say that didn't happen?
[00:15:08.246 --> 00:15:10.788]  She doesn't remember how she got there, but she remembers all the specifics.
[00:15:10.908 --> 00:15:11.528]  I don't think it is.
[00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:12.969]  Which turns out to not be true.
[00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.613]  Judge Kavanaugh has two young daughters, a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old.
[00:15:21.034 --> 00:15:34.282]  For the rest of their lives, their daughters will go to school, will interact with people, many of whom are convinced their father is a rapist.
[00:15:36.357 --> 00:15:39.400]  I want you to think of the effect that has when those are the allegations.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.040]  We're going to come back.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.322]  Oh, and notice, she thought she was going to die, too.
[00:15:42.783 --> 00:15:48.087]  Ten seconds, rolling around on a bed 36 years ago, and the witnesses say it didn't happen, and now it's rape.
[00:15:49.188 --> 00:15:50.069]  Next it'll be murder.
[00:15:50.129 --> 00:15:50.570]  Next it'll be...
[00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:58.426]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[00:15:58.466 --> 00:16:10.298]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:16.363]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:29.474]  Last month, a website called Right Wing Watch posted a report highlighting PayPal's continued business relationship with InfoWars, and the Washington Post also noted how business on the InfoWars stores was booming.
[00:16:29.714 --> 00:16:37.801]  PayPal is the latest big tech company to cut ties with far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, stealing a blow to one of founder Alex Jones' revenue sources.
[00:16:38.021 --> 00:16:48.886]  This is of course coming at a time when many at least reports out there of possible censorship of conservative voices and other people in the media has come to light as well so Contessa certainly a story that we're following very closely.
[00:16:49.026 --> 00:16:55.028]  It actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like they're being silenced.
[00:16:55.248 --> 00:16:56.669]  And we're also standing up
[00:16:57.749 --> 00:17:00.431]  To social media censorship.
[00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:01.311]  That's the new thing.
[00:17:01.732 --> 00:17:05.874]  Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have all booted Jones off their platforms.
[00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:17.341]  PayPal on Thursday night informed InfoWars, which runs an online storefront that sells survival gear and herbal supplements, that it has 10 business days to find a new payment processor.
[00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:21.003]  You can't pick one person and say, well, we don't like what he's been saying.
[00:17:21.063 --> 00:17:21.403]  He's out.
[00:17:21.443 --> 00:17:25.026]  We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in.
[00:17:26.006 --> 00:17:27.087]  And you just can't do that.
[00:17:27.148 --> 00:17:38.018]  Jones hit back on his website saying the InfoWarsStore.com site had no political content, and the move emphasizes how the decision was a broader attack on the InfoWars platform.
[00:17:38.038 --> 00:17:48.769]  A PayPal spokesperson says, quote, we undertook an extensive review of the InfoWars sites and found instances that promoted hate, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, and bullying policies.
[00:17:56.605 --> 00:18:09.390]  Alex, speaking of food, I do have to mention to you that on Monday night, I was invited out to dinner by a New York Times reporter, and he said that it was on him, which meant it was on Carlos Slim.
[00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:21.274]  And therefore, I took him to the finest steakhouse in all of South Florida, where I knew they had an incredible 48-ounce porterhouse that is just a thing to behold.
[00:18:21.294 --> 00:18:22.034]  Okay, I'm getting hungry.
[00:18:22.214 --> 00:18:23.575]  And therefore, I ordered it.
[00:18:23.795 --> 00:18:29.619]  And I must tell you, I enjoyed every bite, but afterwards, it was really debilitating.
[00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:36.204]  And then I remembered, I had ordered a bottle of Carnivore from the InfoWars.com store.
[00:18:36.284 --> 00:18:41.448]  Let me tell you, this is now my new favorite product next to Brain Force Plus.
[00:18:41.508 --> 00:18:41.948]  You don't have
[00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:46.511]  You don't end up like John Wayne with 45 pounds of undigested Hillary Clinton in your guts.
[00:19:11.988 --> 00:19:17.152]  Well, there's nothing better than a glass of red wine and a big ol' juicy porterhouse and potatoes gratin.
[00:19:31.764 --> 00:19:34.625]  And some asparagus, but like I said, I gotta get a driver when I do that.
[00:19:34.685 --> 00:19:35.845]  Actual Uber or whatever.
[00:19:36.165 --> 00:19:39.206]  Because when I get home, it's like BOOM!
[00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:41.646]  We're talking sleep for 12 hours when I eat a Porterhouse.
[00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:43.567]  Yeah, it's called the food coma.
[00:19:43.687 --> 00:19:46.627]  But you can avoid the negative effects with carnivore.
[00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:58.690]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:21.474]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:25.676 --> 00:20:34.223]  So the seasoned prosecutor that came in and grilled Kavanaugh and Ford said that
[00:20:35.293 --> 00:20:41.618]  She would not charge Kavanaugh or even pursue a search warrant that none of Ford's story added up.
[00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:42.599]  None of it was corroborated.
[00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:44.981]  Everyone she said were witnesses said the opposite.
[00:20:45.842 --> 00:20:51.627]  36 years old allegation that only came up now that was held to the 11th hour.
[00:20:52.468 --> 00:20:55.691]  Then the witnesses say none of what's being said is accurate.
[00:20:56.618 --> 00:21:05.240]  The woman is a political operative, burrowed into the Democratic Party, giving 70-plus donations just in the last few years to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.220]  Dianne Feinstein's involved in the whole middle of it.
[00:21:10.341 --> 00:21:12.781]  Feinstein says she didn't leak it to the press, she's been caught lying.
[00:21:13.581 --> 00:21:15.982]  And we're just supposed to go, oh, you poor victim.
[00:21:16.602 --> 00:21:22.883]  When even police will tell you, and criminology, and it's getting worse and worse, that half of sex assault claims are fake.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:33.108]  Every time you hear about a white woman grabbed by four black guys and raped and then, you know, a cracker scrawled on her back, cut on her back.
[00:21:33.548 --> 00:21:34.910]  Turns out that was a fake case.
[00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:40.074]  A black woman said four KKK guys, these were both Texas cases, grabbed her and did the same thing.
[00:21:40.295 --> 00:21:40.735]  It was fake!
[00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:49.944]  How many of the dorms have had swastikas put on them or burning crosses and in every case
[00:21:51.164 --> 00:21:54.086]  It's turned out that it was the students doing it to themselves to get attention.
[00:21:54.266 --> 00:22:04.514]  The Air Force Academy this year, with the head of the Air Force chewing out everybody and saying, whites are bad, and calling the Air Force together, including not just the cadets, but the officers, and saying, this is disgusting!
[00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:09.698]  And then nothing was said when it turned out that a black student put it on the vending machine.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.423]  I've written articles, Breitbart's got articles, there's hundreds of cases
[00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:20.744]  of Democrats staging things and lying about it.
[00:22:20.764 --> 00:22:22.125]  It doesn't mean every case is fake.
[00:22:22.585 --> 00:22:29.188]  It doesn't mean that Ford might not have been assaulted by somebody, because she comes off as kind of out of it.
[00:22:30.008 --> 00:22:36.031]  Doesn't remember how she got there, who got her, remembers the furniture and everything else and every detail, but doesn't have any witnesses.
[00:22:39.008 --> 00:22:41.249]  I mean, maybe she, somebody else assaults her.
[00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:48.194]  There's two men that said there was a party like that and the girl looked like her and they didn't rape her but they got drunk and fell on her and grabbed on her and they shouldn't have.
[00:22:48.474 --> 00:22:49.114]  Maybe it's her.
[00:22:49.414 --> 00:22:50.715]  That's got more credibility!
[00:22:50.735 --> 00:22:52.796]  At least she's got some witnesses now!
[00:22:54.838 --> 00:22:55.038]  See?
[00:22:57.439 --> 00:23:08.106]  But with this whole history of Democrats' specialty being blaming their political enemies for things they haven't done, you've got a right and a duty
[00:23:09.184 --> 00:23:09.384]  I think?
[00:23:28.678 --> 00:23:35.062]  As a political dirty trick, which of course you know, in the main, that's what the Democrats are doing.
[00:23:35.102 --> 00:23:36.983]  There's no debate about it.
[00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:38.524]  Everybody's common sense knows it.
[00:23:38.885 --> 00:23:39.685]  History shows it.
[00:23:41.026 --> 00:23:45.789]  And it lets you know that the Democrats are now going to go below the belt for eternity.
[00:23:46.769 --> 00:23:48.370]  The Republicans have the votes now.
[00:23:50.252 --> 00:23:52.153]  They're reporting to confirm Kavanaugh.
[00:23:53.454 --> 00:23:55.355]  Confirm him or be cucks forever.
[00:23:57.375 --> 00:23:59.637]  And just entertain this type of crud.
[00:23:59.657 --> 00:24:11.404]  Remember Trump had been in office a month and somebody in New Jersey was throwing paint on synagogues and putting swastikas on them and somebody was tumping over Jewish tombstones.
[00:24:13.706 --> 00:24:14.906]  Trump talked to law enforcement.
[00:24:14.926 --> 00:24:16.167]  They already had leads on who it was.
[00:24:16.207 --> 00:24:21.611]  He said, I think it's probably staged by somebody to blame Republicans.
[00:24:23.114 --> 00:24:23.934]  Because that's what was happening.
[00:24:23.974 --> 00:24:28.995]  And sure enough, they busted a leftist Jewish activist man, who then pled guilty to it.
[00:24:29.836 --> 00:24:39.518]  But Trump had to do his first emergency State of the Union on that subject to say, I'm not anti-Semitic, and I don't support turning over tombstones and throwing paint on synagogues.
[00:24:41.038 --> 00:24:41.338]  Okay?
[00:24:43.859 --> 00:24:52.141]  I mean, imagine a country where somebody's tumping over some tombstones, and then the president has to have a special emergency meeting in Congress to say he's not involved.
[00:24:55.984 --> 00:24:57.786]  That's how insane this has gotten!
[00:24:57.806 --> 00:25:04.816]  I should make a documentary just about the left and all the stuff they've been caught staging.
[00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:06.558]  And then we question, well, was this staged?
[00:25:06.598 --> 00:25:07.099]  Was that staged?
[00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.821]  Sometimes there's a real mass shooting.
[00:25:09.202 --> 00:25:10.804]  Sometimes things do happen.
[00:25:10.844 --> 00:25:12.647]  But when you've got the Democrats famous...
[00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.391]  I mean, they said that I said nobody died at Parkland.
[00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:19.012]  I never said that.
[00:25:19.052 --> 00:25:20.953]  See, they even flip and lie on that front.
[00:25:21.393 --> 00:25:28.317]  It's just anyone that's engaged with Democrats knows they are the worst group of people you've ever heard of or ever seen.
[00:25:28.337 --> 00:25:29.617]  We're going to David Knight in the next segment.
[00:25:30.158 --> 00:25:37.021]  I wanted to get to more of this clip with Cruz, and then I'll play a Lindsey Graham clip once David's on with us.
[00:25:37.061 --> 00:25:43.045]  But we're going to be here live covering this all day on the radio and on TV and at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:44.225 --> 00:25:44.806]  Understand this.
[00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:48.413]  I tend to be somewhat stoic about attacks.
[00:25:49.334 --> 00:25:52.957]  People call me and they ask me, how are you handling being attacked and demonized and lied about everywhere?
[00:25:52.977 --> 00:25:54.478]  I mean, it's just horrible.
[00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:59.482]  My wife was playing tennis with friends that she's played tennis with for 10 years.
[00:26:00.643 --> 00:26:08.330]  And both people she plays tennis with is like, man, they make your husband look really bad on these Sandy Hook pieces that are on every day.
[00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.292]  And they also say, you know, he's a racist.
[00:26:11.993 --> 00:26:12.873]  And we know that's not true.
[00:26:12.893 --> 00:26:13.974]  How are you holding up?
[00:26:14.014 --> 00:26:14.515]  We're like, listen.
[00:26:15.558 --> 00:26:20.281]  She said, we're fighting a corrupt system that's trying to destroy everybody, so we just know it's not true.
[00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:21.062]  We just move forward.
[00:26:21.482 --> 00:26:27.066]  You can't live under this terrorism and under this deception of mainstream media and the twisting and deception.
[00:26:27.106 --> 00:26:28.627]  You have to stand against it.
[00:26:30.189 --> 00:26:41.617]  And Kanye West, who I know was a listener, because I've talked to some of his folks, and I'll leave it at that, and talked to a lot of friends with him, and I did know that he was close to coming on the show when I put that out on Twitter months ago.
[00:26:43.473 --> 00:26:45.114]  Because he was talking to his folks about it happening.
[00:26:45.294 --> 00:26:49.035]  And then they, for some reason, got cold feet and it didn't transpire.
[00:26:49.055 --> 00:26:52.697]  I was talking about Candace Owens and all the rest of it.
[00:26:53.297 --> 00:27:00.740]  But yesterday in a speech, and it's been in a bunch of different newspapers, he said, Alex Jones and Donald Trump are matrix breakers.
[00:27:02.261 --> 00:27:06.342]  And he also tried to bring people together wearing a Kaepernick shirt and a Make America Great Again hat.
[00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:10.264]  And his point is, people have a right to exercise free speech, period.
[00:27:11.664 --> 00:27:13.085]  Stop demonizing folks that do it.
[00:27:14.753 --> 00:27:17.533]  But Kanye West understands that the First Amendment is under attack.
[00:27:18.254 --> 00:27:22.674]  And I know he's making some big, bold moves for real independent media that he's going to be launching very, very soon.
[00:27:22.714 --> 00:27:24.455]  I'll leave it at that to counter the system.
[00:27:24.475 --> 00:27:42.518]  So if the globalists think they're going to shut me up or Donald Trump up, I mean, Kanye West is rolling out, reportedly, he wants to make more than 20 films a year, hundreds of documentaries and news clips and everything just to counter this whole system and to try to bring in a new renaissance.
[00:27:44.241 --> 00:27:51.142]  Well, that's right down my alley, and I know that's down your alley, so thank God Kanye West is so awake and so alive, and he's a real enemy of the globalists.
[00:27:51.162 --> 00:27:57.263]  We appreciate his support, and his standing in defiance against their attempts to destroy my name, so thank you.
[00:27:58.023 --> 00:27:59.104]  He's a real maverick.
[00:27:59.904 --> 00:28:03.164]  That said, if you don't financially support us, we'll be destroyed.
[00:28:04.045 --> 00:28:05.005]  They've taken PayPal.
[00:28:05.665 --> 00:28:07.385]  Right now they're trying to take our other payment processors.
[00:28:07.405 --> 00:28:08.145]  We get calls from them.
[00:28:08.165 --> 00:28:10.046]  They're doing a lot of really bad stuff behind the scenes.
[00:28:11.146 --> 00:28:12.106]  We're going to be able to deal with it.
[00:28:14.002 --> 00:28:19.387]  But I gotta tell you, you order, your payment process goes right through, we ship within days.
[00:28:19.407 --> 00:28:20.468]  A lot of times the same day.
[00:28:20.528 --> 00:28:29.536]  But if you want to make sure you can get products at M4WareStore.com or M4WareLife.com, you need to order them right now, because we may go into a time here in about a week where we don't have a payment processor.
[00:28:29.596 --> 00:28:30.818]  It'll be celebrated all over the media.
[00:28:30.858 --> 00:28:32.219]  Look, his store is shut down!
[00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:33.260]  He can't buy and sell!
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:33.900]  Yay!
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.463]  It's what Stalin did to the poor Kulaks!
[00:28:38.524 --> 00:28:41.367]  I mean, this is bonafide as bad as it gets.
[00:28:41.708 --> 00:28:46.153]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, a bunch of big specials at the end this weekend.
[00:28:46.814 --> 00:28:47.835]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:47.855 --> 00:28:48.636]  Get your brain force.
[00:28:48.676 --> 00:28:49.136]  Get your X2.
[00:28:49.677 --> 00:28:50.578]  Get your survival shield.
[00:28:50.598 --> 00:28:50.918]  Get it all.
[00:28:52.653 --> 00:28:56.115]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:28:56.615 --> 00:28:59.378]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:28:59.898 --> 00:29:05.702]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:29:06.183 --> 00:29:08.945]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:29:09.685 --> 00:29:13.128]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:29:13.488 --> 00:29:19.573]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:29:19.973 --> 00:29:24.938]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:29:25.678 --> 00:29:29.081]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:36.147]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:29:36.807 --> 00:29:41.491]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:29:41.511 --> 00:29:47.136]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:29:47.737 --> 00:29:51.700]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.061]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:29:57.121 --> 00:29:58.562]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:29:58.622 --> 00:29:58.983]  Go ahead.
[00:29:59.083 --> 00:29:59.363]  Yes.
[00:29:59.803 --> 00:30:00.524]  Hi, Alex.
[00:30:00.624 --> 00:30:06.829]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:11.012]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:30:11.253 --> 00:30:12.714]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:30:13.074 --> 00:30:19.780]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.702]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:30:23.583 --> 00:30:28.286]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:36.152]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:30:36.172 --> 00:30:41.996]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Coalital Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:30:42.136 --> 00:30:47.440]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality coalital silver.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.542]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[00:30:53.883 --> 00:30:55.886]  Introducing Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[00:30:55.966 --> 00:31:00.712]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:04.497]  Ultimate Bone Broth to help you save big on this new product and stock up.
[00:31:04.537 --> 00:31:07.000]  We're dropping the price to $19.95.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.766]  Our previous supplier was unable to get the incredible ingredients while keeping
[00:31:11.766 --> 00:31:12.227]  We're good.
[00:31:26.803 --> 00:31:31.547]  Chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, and alfalfa herb powder.
[00:31:31.687 --> 00:31:32.808]  And even more, of course.
[00:31:32.948 --> 00:31:42.455]  These powerful ingredients are going to help you get the most out of your workout by supporting your healthy muscles, digestion, tendons, and ligaments, while also supporting your body's fight against free radicals.

[00:31:49.861 --> 00:31:50.262]  Thank you!
[00:31:52.472 --> 00:31:54.433]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[00:31:54.833 --> 00:32:01.076]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[00:32:01.436 --> 00:32:05.398]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[00:32:55.491 --> 00:32:58.153]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.895 --> 00:33:16.216]  You want to stop Cory Booker?
[00:33:16.516 --> 00:33:23.459]  Well, so do I. You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:23.719 --> 00:33:24.879]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:30.201]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:41.546]  I was back in the break room getting myself a glass of ice water, and listened to about a minute of Cory Booker.
[00:33:43.015 --> 00:33:45.756]  I am just disgusted that anyone claims this is partisan.
[00:33:46.477 --> 00:33:52.639]  Why, we just love women and Dr. Ford is just a wonderful person.
[00:33:52.659 --> 00:33:53.800]  She's not political at all.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.681]  And he's so disingenuous.
[00:33:56.701 --> 00:34:00.763]  I mean, if I walked on a used car lot and that guy walked up and talked like that, I wouldn't walk.
[00:34:00.923 --> 00:34:02.023]  I would sprint.
[00:34:02.363 --> 00:34:04.624]  I would vault over the cars.
[00:34:05.224 --> 00:34:11.167]  Like I was in the Olympics and just... I mean, it'd be like the roadrunner running from Coyote.
[00:34:12.267 --> 00:34:14.834]  And he's been intimately involved in cooking all this up.
[00:34:16.038 --> 00:34:17.281]  He's such a liar!
[00:34:17.302 --> 00:34:19.207]  I mean, these people are just scum!
[00:34:20.984 --> 00:34:22.845]  They have no chivalry, no nothing.
[00:34:23.305 --> 00:34:24.445]  And America's waking up to this.
[00:34:24.525 --> 00:34:25.985]  The Democrats are amazing.
[00:34:26.005 --> 00:34:34.528]  Let's finish up a little bit of Cruz, where he makes the point that they're acting like Kavanaugh is a rapist, even if this was true, which none of the witnesses say it is.
[00:34:34.628 --> 00:34:35.408]  Wow, that's important.
[00:34:36.128 --> 00:34:37.869]  36 years old, and none of the witnesses say it happened.
[00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:45.831]  She remembers nothing corroborating it, just the specifics that 100% in the house, sparsely furnished, upstairs, in the room.
[00:34:45.871 --> 00:34:46.271]  They did it!
[00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:46.632]  It's him!
[00:34:46.692 --> 00:34:47.052]  It's him! 100%!
[00:34:51.107 --> 00:34:52.828]  And think about that, now becomes rape.
[00:34:52.988 --> 00:34:54.049]  Well, that's what the feminists teach.
[00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:55.369]  All sex is rape.
[00:34:58.351 --> 00:35:06.176]  No, what's rape is telling your three-year-old they're really a girl, they're a boy, and then priming them and tricking them into saying they're gonna be another gender, so you can depopulate the earth.
[00:35:06.276 --> 00:35:07.196]  That's child abuse.
[00:35:08.537 --> 00:35:11.819]  Child abuse is putting boys with girls in the Boy Scouts.
[00:35:13.035 --> 00:35:23.960]  And handing out condoms at the World Boy Scout Convention so that there can be open pedophilia with adults in a giant child molestation gangbang.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.541]  That's what it was!
[00:35:27.481 --> 00:35:29.002]  They've taken your kids!
[00:35:31.563 --> 00:35:41.568]  We've had nurses on, we're in the preemie wards, when they give them the vaccines, they have to get the respirators ready, because they order them to give the vaccines, the bioethics board does, they give them the shots and a lot of the kids die right there.
[00:35:42.383 --> 00:35:44.163]  They stopped breathing, they gotta be brought back to life.
[00:35:44.563 --> 00:35:46.364]  And the inserts says it can kill you.
[00:35:46.584 --> 00:35:47.464]  And don't give it to a preemie.
[00:35:48.024 --> 00:35:49.524]  But the bioethics do, see?
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:52.285]  Oh, but they care so much about the children.
[00:35:54.545 --> 00:35:55.906]  So here's a clip of Ted Cruz.
[00:35:55.926 --> 00:35:58.566]  Then we're going to David Knight, who did a great job this morning breaking all this down.
[00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:00.087]  He has a big analysis set for us.
[00:36:00.127 --> 00:36:01.287]  We'll do this a little bit in the next hour.
[00:36:01.327 --> 00:36:04.027]  Then Owen Schroeder's coming in with continual coverage here.
[00:36:04.127 --> 00:36:06.748]  And they say he's got the votes right now, so need to move now.
[00:36:06.768 --> 00:36:09.649]  Or he set the precedent for these lynch mobs.
[00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:11.629]  See, it's a lynch mob.
[00:36:13.063 --> 00:36:15.764]  Statue of Limitations, none of the witnesses say it happened.
[00:36:16.584 --> 00:36:17.224]  Does it matter?
[00:36:18.444 --> 00:36:21.165]  Because it's a high-tech lynch mob.
[00:36:21.465 --> 00:36:24.886]  Just like Terrence Thomas said, this is a high-tech lynch mob.
[00:36:25.366 --> 00:36:27.467]  This is a high-tech lynch mob of Kavanaugh.
[00:36:28.307 --> 00:36:30.188]  But they learned, we're not going to just have one woman say it.
[00:36:30.848 --> 00:36:31.928]  We'll have a whole bunch say it!
[00:36:33.128 --> 00:36:34.589]  Doesn't matter if their stories all fall apart.
[00:36:34.889 --> 00:36:35.649]  Doesn't matter!
[00:36:35.869 --> 00:36:39.350]  Because they're all going to raise millions of dollars in their GoFundMe accounts.
[00:36:41.237 --> 00:36:42.137]  But there's no motive.
[00:36:42.337 --> 00:36:46.039]  Just be a superstar leftist Hillary-ite and get a million dollars?
[00:36:46.059 --> 00:36:46.119]  Wow!
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.601]  Maybe I remember something about Kavanaugh did to me.
[00:36:54.722 --> 00:36:55.262]  I'm gonna admit it.
[00:36:55.342 --> 00:36:55.983]  Kavanaugh raped me.
[00:36:57.643 --> 00:36:58.784]  Oh, you're making light of rape?
[00:36:59.004 --> 00:37:00.524]  No, the Democrats funded the Arab Spring.
[00:37:00.984 --> 00:37:04.806]  They killed millions of people and hundreds of thousands of women and children into sex slavery.
[00:37:05.106 --> 00:37:07.827]  And now Libya and other areas shell women into sex slavery.
[00:37:08.007 --> 00:37:08.567]  That's real!
[00:37:09.548 --> 00:37:10.448]  And you don't care about that!
[00:37:11.991 --> 00:37:13.612]  Hollywood is there to exploit women!
[00:37:15.573 --> 00:37:16.474]  Let's go to Ted Cruz.
[00:37:16.494 --> 00:37:23.819]  I want you to think of the effect that has when those are the allegations.
[00:37:23.859 --> 00:37:24.739]  That's where it starts.
[00:37:24.799 --> 00:37:26.861]  Not, I disagree with your jurisprudence.
[00:37:26.901 --> 00:37:30.463]  Not, I think you're wrong in how you interpret the Constitution.
[00:37:30.503 --> 00:37:39.569]  But you are, and let's be clear, he has been accused of, among other things, participating in repeatedly drugging and gang raping women.
[00:37:41.124 --> 00:37:44.645]  To take some of the more sensational and I think ludicrous claims that have been aired.
[00:37:47.086 --> 00:37:50.227]  These little girls are going to have classmates of theirs repeat those charges to them.
[00:37:52.608 --> 00:38:01.611]  Some of the most poignant testimony yesterday is when Judge Kavanaugh described how he's taught law at Harvard Law School for over a decade.
[00:38:03.472 --> 00:38:05.613]  And he said he may never get to teach law again.
[00:38:07.423 --> 00:38:08.563]  And that's entirely possible.
[00:38:08.583 --> 00:38:11.484]  That's entirely possible, even if Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the U.S.
[00:38:11.504 --> 00:38:14.685]  Supreme Court as a sitting justice in our polarized world.
[00:38:15.485 --> 00:38:16.966]  I'm a graduate of the Harvard Law School.
[00:38:16.986 --> 00:38:22.987]  I think it is entirely possible those on the left would say, we don't want someone we believe is a rapist ever teaching again.
[00:38:26.608 --> 00:38:33.070]  He also talked about how much he has loved coaching girls basketball, coaching his daughters in basketball.
[00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:36.711]  And he mentioned he may never coach again.
[00:38:40.233 --> 00:38:50.042]  That's a very real possible consequence of the mudslinging and irresponsible behavior of the last two weeks.
[00:38:52.124 --> 00:38:55.788]  It may well be in this tribalized, partisan, divided world
[00:38:56.974 --> 00:39:00.218]  That the parents of the other girls say, no, we don't want him as a coach anymore.
[00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:00.618]  That's right.
[00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:01.339]  Let's stop right there.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.781]  And that's... We have more of this later.
[00:39:03.801 --> 00:39:04.382]  I want to go to David.
[00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:06.304]  That's where this is going.
[00:39:06.324 --> 00:39:07.365]  They want it to go there.
[00:39:07.405 --> 00:39:10.229]  And Republicans and Christians, we don't act like this.
[00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:15.634]  We'd say, you should have reported it, or we should have heard about it, or there should be other cases of him doing this.
[00:39:17.012 --> 00:39:20.193]  And if your witness is checked out, we'd say, okay, maybe withdraw him.
[00:39:20.393 --> 00:39:21.213]  They don't check out.
[00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:24.514]  And then you're a big political operative, but you say you're not political.
[00:39:24.794 --> 00:39:27.935]  And then Feinstein gets caught leaking, and you guys put out this whole story.
[00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:37.798]  But then the Christian family prays for Ford, and the rest of them says, we have no ill will.
[00:39:39.559 --> 00:39:42.840]  Well, you know, I'm a Christian, but I'm not that Christian.
[00:39:45.137 --> 00:39:46.058]  I'll just be honest with you.
[00:39:46.218 --> 00:39:47.659]  I've been lied about by these people.
[00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:51.421]  I've experienced whole cloth BS, and I'm fed up with it.
[00:39:55.343 --> 00:40:06.350]  They will lie to get power, and they will twist, and they will edit, and they will deceive, and they will do anything.
[00:40:09.251 --> 00:40:11.112]  And they take our kindness for weakness.
[00:40:11.152 --> 00:40:12.073]  Well, no more.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:29.665]  Can you imagine if anybody who's prominent, if somebody could just say 36 years ago, you did this to me and then your life's ruined, that's guilty, and you don't get to prove your innocence.
[00:40:30.526 --> 00:40:32.586]  It's worse than guilty until proven innocent.
[00:40:32.967 --> 00:40:34.367]  It's guilty, period.
[00:40:35.628 --> 00:40:44.131]  If the mainstream media decides to say they think it's credible with no evidence, but oh, when it's real, when it's pedophile aircraft and true evil,
[00:40:45.373 --> 00:40:49.036]  And Bill Clinton, and the Arab Spring, and sexualizing children, and all the rest of it.
[00:40:49.056 --> 00:40:49.617]  Then it's okay.
[00:40:49.917 --> 00:40:50.718]  David Knight joins us.
[00:40:50.758 --> 00:40:52.279]  Powerful Lindsey Graham clip coming up next.
[00:40:52.859 --> 00:40:54.441]  David, I know you've been watching this whole morning.
[00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:55.942]  The Republicans think they have the votes.
[00:40:56.282 --> 00:40:57.503]  Where do you think this is going?
[00:40:57.523 --> 00:41:05.030]  I mean, this is just... It does show the political warfare is heated up, but they're the ones that have heated up the political warfare.
[00:41:06.226 --> 00:41:10.895]  Well, you know, Alex, yesterday, when I was on with you, we had the breaking story from the New York Times opinion desk.
[00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.999]  They had tweeted out, uh, do you believe her?
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:13.741]  Or whatever.
[00:41:13.801 --> 00:41:14.863]  And they had to take it down.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.781]  Because I said that was abusive.
[00:41:16.881 --> 00:41:20.345]  And we've seen that same type of attitude from the Republicans as well.
[00:41:20.905 --> 00:41:23.948]  They have absolutely no backbone to confront her with the evidence.
[00:41:23.968 --> 00:41:27.611]  You know, everybody says, oh, gotta believe women, gotta believe survivors.
[00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:32.776]  It's like, no, you can hear them, you need to hear them, but you need to believe in due process.
[00:41:33.197 --> 00:41:38.722]  And you need to say, well, I want to hear what you have to say, but let's see some proof of this, because these are very serious allegations.
[00:41:39.082 --> 00:41:42.365]  We also hear from them, well, the allegations are so serious that they need to be believed.
[00:41:42.385 --> 00:41:50.812]  No, a murder allegation is serious, but that means that the person needs even more due process, a fair hearing, a presumption of innocence.
[00:41:51.152 --> 00:41:54.976]  And so we see all this... Yeah, so how is it insensitive to say, do you believe her?
[00:41:55.196 --> 00:41:57.998]  They had polls about, do you believe Kavanaugh, and they call him all sorts of names.
[00:41:58.379 --> 00:42:04.164]  Again, it's this new idea where, like, the whole country's a giant PR firm, and we don't even have a First Amendment anymore.
[00:42:04.304 --> 00:42:05.485]  I mean, this is so dangerous.
[00:42:06.377 --> 00:42:11.681]  Well, I think what is amazing is, I kind of expected that from the New York Times, because they want to pander to the left.
[00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:17.947]  But we see that the Republicans, Alex, you know, we broke that yearbook stuff last week.
[00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:20.889]  And the Republicans were afraid to use that.
[00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:23.691]  They said, that's a minefield given the Me Too movement.
[00:42:23.731 --> 00:42:24.252]  They've got it.
[00:42:24.272 --> 00:42:32.699]  They've got congressional staffers saying, oh, she doesn't come across as being very credible because of the context of what was going on in all of those high schools in that area.
[00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:35.121]  How they were all bragging about this very kind of behavior.
[00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:39.647]  But they were afraid to use that because it would be looking like they were bullying, and that's what Kamala Harris said.
[00:42:39.887 --> 00:42:42.851]  Said you confront her with evidence, you ask her for details, you're bullying her.
[00:42:43.052 --> 00:42:46.757]  Yeah, they wouldn't even show her as a party animal in the high school annual.
[00:42:47.418 --> 00:42:49.961]  We'll be right back to ask the question, will he get confirmed?
[00:42:49.981 --> 00:42:50.782]  I say yes.
[00:42:54.904 --> 00:43:03.912]  Florida elections are always competitive, and this is a guy who, although he's much too liberal for Florida, I think he's got huge problems with how he's governed Tallahassee.
[00:43:04.872 --> 00:43:09.656]  He is an articulate spokesman for those far-left views, and he's a charismatic candidate.
[00:43:10.097 --> 00:43:17.483]  I watched those Democrat debates, and none of that was my cup of tea, but he performed better than the other people there, so we've got to work hard.
[00:43:17.503 --> 00:43:18.244]  Monkey this up.
[00:43:18.304 --> 00:43:19.185]  What does that mean to you?
[00:43:36.926 --> 00:43:50.658]  Well, I'll try to be articulate, Chris, and simply say that that kind of vitriol, and he's apparently given up the whistle, they've gone to the bullhorn with these kinds of tactics, but they're not going to work.
[00:43:51.698 --> 00:44:05.190]  We tried this one time, Donald Trump, this is a page from his playbook, basically tried to divide this country and my state, and I want them to know that Florida voters are smarter than that, that we are going to reject the politics of separation.
[00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:10.012]  Will Johnson is kind of the undercover agent out on the West Coast.
[00:44:10.212 --> 00:44:11.432]  Very powerful indeed.
[00:44:11.693 --> 00:44:15.474]  Unite America First is where you can find a lot of his content.
[00:44:15.634 --> 00:44:17.195]  But were you banned, Will?
[00:44:17.355 --> 00:44:19.636]  Or were you just put in timeout on Facebook?
[00:44:19.676 --> 00:44:20.956]  We'll get into why in a second.
[00:44:20.996 --> 00:44:22.577]  But what is your current status?
[00:44:22.697 --> 00:44:24.658]  I believe it's on Facebook where they're censoring you now?
[00:44:24.978 --> 00:44:30.926]  Yes, I've been banned for 30 days because I said black people are not monkeys.
[00:44:31.186 --> 00:44:39.257]  So it's bad if you say monkey even though you're not talking about black people, but then if you say black people are not monkeys, that's even worse and you get banned.
[00:44:40.245 --> 00:44:40.885]  Exactly.
[00:44:41.326 --> 00:44:41.646]  Exactly.
[00:44:41.666 --> 00:44:55.515]  And I was just making a point that the gentleman in Florida making a statement about monkeying around, the same statement Obama said, the same statement Chuck Schumer said, the same statement Dianne Feinstein said, but because he said it, he's a Republican, it's racist.
[00:44:55.735 --> 00:45:01.399]  Do they really believe he said that to signal to white people that, hey, this is a racist, anti-black candidate?
[00:45:01.419 --> 00:45:03.040]  Do you think they really believe that?
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.621]  No, they don't believe that.
[00:45:04.661 --> 00:45:14.906]  They're just using this as a tactic to attack him, to attack any Republicans, to try to demonize them as racist white people trying to run for position in any political position across the nation.
[00:45:15.006 --> 00:45:20.328]  I mean, seriously, they are trying to, they pick anything and everything to try to demonize someone.
[00:45:20.408 --> 00:45:25.271]  And when they sent me the thing in Facebook banning me, they just said, you've been banned for this video.
[00:45:25.331 --> 00:45:29.052]  And they said, if you do anything like this again, we're going to permanently ban you.
[00:45:29.433 --> 00:45:32.094]  So my question is, is what is that, what statement
[00:45:32.694 --> 00:45:32.854]  Hey!
[00:45:32.874 --> 00:45:33.975]  Did you just call me a monkey?! !
[00:45:53.698 --> 00:45:55.139]  You get the monkey pass.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:03.243]  Me as a black male... Me as a black male, I'm giving you the monkey pass.
[00:46:04.164 --> 00:46:06.245]  I can say, can I act like a monkey too?
[00:46:06.305 --> 00:46:07.666]  Can I go... Shut down InfoWars!
[00:46:07.686 --> 00:46:09.387]  Shut it down!
[00:46:14.252 --> 00:46:16.633]  They tell us we evolved from monkeys, right?
[00:46:16.653 --> 00:46:18.675]  They try to tell us we evolved from monkeys.
[00:46:18.735 --> 00:46:19.995]  Just totally ludicrous.
[00:46:20.235 --> 00:46:24.018]  But then they say, if you say you're a monkey, you have to get banned and you're a racist.
[00:46:24.618 --> 00:46:26.139]  Exactly.
[00:46:26.359 --> 00:46:30.841]  I get so many attacks simply because I support the president and he's a white man.
[00:46:30.981 --> 00:46:32.322]  But he's the president of the United States.
[00:46:32.462 --> 00:46:33.383]  I voted for him.
[00:46:33.523 --> 00:46:34.704]  Most of us voted for him.
[00:46:34.784 --> 00:46:36.064]  We should not have to do that.
[00:46:36.204 --> 00:46:38.025]  And it's crazy that they're doing that to us.
[00:46:38.746 --> 00:46:39.366]  Monkey!
[00:46:39.966 --> 00:46:40.287]  Monkey?
[00:46:42.327 --> 00:46:43.108]  I'm a monkey!
[00:46:43.328 --> 00:46:46.569]  Monkey!
[00:46:56.512 --> 00:46:59.213]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:09.318 --> 00:47:13.281]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:14.862 --> 00:47:17.563]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.486 --> 00:47:36.196]  Alright, we're gonna get to this Lindsey Graham piece and I'm gonna ask David Knight the question, host of the broadcast that he does, the David Knight Show, 8am to 11am, that comes on every weekday right before I go live.
[00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:39.964]  I believe Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed right now.
[00:47:41.286 --> 00:47:48.017]  Unless the Democrats roll a truck bomb in there or shoot somebody or, you know, have 50 women show up and slit their wrists or something.
[00:47:48.057 --> 00:47:52.423]  I mean, they're going for broke, but what are they going to do next after he does get confirmed?
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.722]  I mean, I think it's clear that if they don't win the midterms, they're gonna burn down half the country.
[00:47:56.762 --> 00:48:03.425]  I mean, they are just working themselves into this frenzy, and it lets you know they believed they were about to have their true revolution with Hillary.
[00:48:03.686 --> 00:48:04.606]  Their real dominion.
[00:48:05.206 --> 00:48:05.867]  They'd said that.
[00:48:05.947 --> 00:48:07.067]  The censorship, everything.
[00:48:07.908 --> 00:48:11.270]  So, what you see is an extension of what was already being planned, just not as bad.
[00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:13.931]  We'll talk to David in a moment.
[00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:20.655]  Again, please don't forget, there's a big national campaign to take us off the air, funded by George Soros, the Democrats.
[00:48:21.564 --> 00:48:23.285]  So they put out disinfo, smears, lies.
[00:48:23.345 --> 00:48:24.646]  And when that doesn't work, they shut us down.
[00:48:24.686 --> 00:48:30.449]  And when deplatforming us off of 90-plus systems doesn't work, they go, oh, get PayPal to dump you, saying your hate.
[00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.951]  But PayPal works with WorldStarHipHop.
[00:48:33.531 --> 00:48:35.693]  It literally has snuff films, people killing people on there.
[00:48:37.594 --> 00:48:38.754]  This is the lawlessness.
[00:48:38.774 --> 00:48:40.876]  This is the thuggery.
[00:48:40.936 --> 00:48:42.777]  This is the evil.
[00:48:42.817 --> 00:48:45.118]  And now they're going after other payment processors.
[00:48:45.138 --> 00:48:49.421]  So when I say, if you want to get products at InfoWareStore.com,
[00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:57.031]  We need you more than ever to absolutely fill our war chest, and we make it easy.

[00:49:17.576 --> 00:49:18.256]  That's now broken.

[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.782]  Very hard to get, very hard to source, very expensive for us to make.
[00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:26.083]  This is the last run of that.
[00:49:27.987 --> 00:49:29.488]  So, a lot of things going on.

[00:49:41.132 --> 00:49:42.112]  Blow away the competition.
[00:49:42.132 --> 00:49:42.933]  So does AlexaPure.

[00:49:46.554 --> 00:49:52.056]  And I want to thank you all for standing with us over the years, but now is the real crunch time.
[00:49:52.716 --> 00:49:56.478]  This is the time where I need you to go in, buy the product, sign up for AutoShip,
[00:49:58.266 --> 00:50:01.949]  And just support the transmission, because without you, they're going to win.
[00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:05.912]  David, I want to go to this Lindsey Graham clip, but just other points you'd like to make.
[00:50:06.073 --> 00:50:07.594]  You have a lot of notes and key points.
[00:50:08.495 --> 00:50:12.118]  A, and then B, do you agree with me that he's going to get confirmed today?
[00:50:12.138 --> 00:50:15.440]  Or at least he's going to go out of the committee, I guess.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.521]  He's then going to go to the full vote.
[00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:18.183]  It's going to be a circus in the next week.
[00:50:18.223 --> 00:50:19.343]  My gosh, I hadn't thought about that.
[00:50:19.764 --> 00:50:23.347]  And what are they going to pull in the meantime to try to derail this?
[00:50:23.367 --> 00:50:24.608]  Because currently they've got the votes.
[00:50:25.388 --> 00:50:26.850]  They need to accelerate this through.
[00:50:28.393 --> 00:50:30.655]  Yeah, I don't know if they're going to confirm him or not.
[00:50:30.715 --> 00:50:39.382]  I mean, that's something that the whips are going to be taking a look at, and of course there's this constant back and forth, this war that's being fought in the media.
[00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:49.411]  And yeah, I mean, the problem, Alex, I think this is really what got to Lindsey Graham, is the fact that the Democrats didn't win, but they don't care, because they're going to throw all the rules out.
[00:50:49.431 --> 00:50:51.053]  They're not going to go by the election.
[00:50:51.833 --> 00:50:53.975]  And they, you know, we had an election.
[00:50:54.256 --> 00:50:56.758]  Trump gets to pick who the Supreme Court nominee is.
[00:50:57.259 --> 00:50:58.741]  I wish he'd pick somebody else.
[00:50:59.021 --> 00:51:00.843]  But we're not even talking about the issues here.
[00:51:01.143 --> 00:51:04.847]  Now it's become an up-or-down referendum on whether or not he's innocent.
[00:51:05.388 --> 00:51:08.471]  And I think that after what we saw yesterday, I think he is innocent.
[00:51:08.531 --> 00:51:12.975]  But it's kind of interesting to me to see that the way that this is pushing from the
[00:51:13.556 --> 00:51:22.481]  Media, the way the entertainment industry is pushing on this, they're attacking him because he was angry about how his reputation had been destroyed.
[00:51:23.251 --> 00:51:28.553]  And I look at this and I had obviously the exact opposite take on this.
[00:51:28.733 --> 00:51:32.134]  I looked at it and I saw that she wasn't traumatized.
[00:51:32.174 --> 00:51:34.135]  She wasn't upset about this.
[00:51:34.855 --> 00:51:41.077]  And here we are, we're supposed to believe that she's still, all these 35 years later, she's going to have multiple doors to her house.
[00:51:41.117 --> 00:51:42.657]  She can't fly and so forth.
[00:51:42.697 --> 00:51:46.999]  And yet we find that she's going multiple trips to Tahiti, to Hawaii and so forth.
[00:51:47.739 --> 00:51:49.920]  And she didn't seem to be perturbed at all.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:52:06.809]  And yet, when he gets upset and angry about this, he's attacked by the Hollywood left, he's attacked by these court jesters of the Democrat Party, like Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, complaining about the fact that he got angry defending his honor, and then you've got Mia Farah, of all people.
[00:52:07.529 --> 00:52:12.593]  Coming out and saying, apart from all the rest, a person prone to melting down probably shouldn't be on the Supreme Court.
[00:52:12.633 --> 00:52:13.994]  And I retweeted that.
[00:52:14.595 --> 00:52:22.822]  And I said, well, maybe somebody who isn't sure who the father of her son is and whose husband married her daughter ought to shut up.
[00:52:23.462 --> 00:52:25.383]  About sexual assaults.
[00:52:25.783 --> 00:52:27.924]  Because this is the state of Hollywood.
[00:52:28.024 --> 00:52:29.304]  And this is the hypocrisy.
[00:52:29.504 --> 00:52:30.805]  David, you're absolutely right.
[00:52:30.825 --> 00:52:32.266]  We've got some big breaking news.
[00:52:33.246 --> 00:52:36.207]  Michael Savage has tweeted out at Savage Nation.
[00:52:36.227 --> 00:52:37.608]  We're posting it at Infowars.com.
[00:52:37.948 --> 00:52:40.189]  Is Dr. Ford deeply tied to the CIA?
[00:52:40.749 --> 00:52:42.190]  Is Dr. Ford deeply tied to the CIA?
[00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.430]  Who is Dr. Ford?
[00:52:44.951 --> 00:52:52.494]  Well, besides being a professor at the off-brand university, she also works as a major at a university down the street from Palo Alto.
[00:52:53.334 --> 00:53:03.143]  She just so happens to be the head of the CIA undergraduate internship program at Stanford University.
[00:53:04.285 --> 00:53:06.667]  The Google people, she said, were interns?
[00:53:07.407 --> 00:53:08.328]  Now they're CIA?
[00:53:08.708 --> 00:53:08.948]  Yes.
[00:53:09.148 --> 00:53:16.093]  Christine Blassie's brother, Ralph III, used to work for the international law firm of Baker-Hostetler.
[00:53:16.473 --> 00:53:20.716]  The firm created Fusion GPS, the company who wrote the Russian dossier.
[00:53:20.736 --> 00:53:23.858]  They later admitted it was only a collection of field interviews.
[00:53:24.239 --> 00:53:30.763]  Baker-Hostetler is located in the same building where the CIA operates in Washington, D.C.
[00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:33.625]  Three companies called Redcoats, Inc.
[00:53:34.826 --> 00:53:39.128]  Admiral Security Services and Data Watch, they are all operated by Ralph Blassie II.
[00:53:39.168 --> 00:53:41.930]  He is the father of Christine and Ralph III.
[00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:44.952]  Christine and Ralph III's grandfather was Nicholas Deke.
[00:53:45.512 --> 00:53:50.835]  Former CIA Director William Casey acknowledged Deke's decades of service to the CIA.
[00:53:51.296 --> 00:53:59.321]  So this is a whole, like I said, leftist stay-behind networks in the CIA infesting the Republican Party as well, David Knight.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:04.241]  Well, she's got a CIA genealogy, and they proudly refer to themselves as Redcoats.
[00:54:05.321 --> 00:54:06.161]  That's how I view them.
[00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:07.342]  That's how you view them, isn't it?
[00:54:07.402 --> 00:54:07.842]  Redcoats?
[00:54:09.002 --> 00:54:10.342]  Let's play Senator Graham.
[00:54:10.462 --> 00:54:11.623]  Well, they've gone too far.
[00:54:12.163 --> 00:54:13.363]  All these groups have gone too far.
[00:54:13.403 --> 00:54:15.804]  Let's go ahead and... But they are bold.
[00:54:15.844 --> 00:54:18.264]  I mean, the activity they engage in is stunning.
[00:54:18.984 --> 00:54:19.464]  That's amazing.
[00:54:19.524 --> 00:54:22.365]  Let's go ahead and play Senator Graham.
[00:54:22.952 --> 00:54:24.234]  I did meet with Senator Feinstein.
[00:54:24.254 --> 00:54:28.561]  Did you know that her staff had already recommended a lawyer to Dr. Ford?
[00:54:29.483 --> 00:54:30.244]  I did not know that.
[00:54:30.705 --> 00:54:35.332]  Did you know that her and her staff had this allegations for over 20 days?
[00:54:36.912 --> 00:54:38.173]  I did not know that at the time.
[00:54:38.934 --> 00:54:42.498]  If you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.
[00:54:43.019 --> 00:54:49.465]  What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020.
[00:54:49.826 --> 00:54:50.847]  You've said that!
[00:54:51.528 --> 00:54:52.088]  Not me.
[00:54:53.009 --> 00:54:55.212]  You've got nothing to apologize for.
[00:54:56.394 --> 00:54:59.696]  When you see Sotomayor and Kagan, tell them that Lindsey said all of it.
[00:55:00.156 --> 00:55:01.356]  Because I voted for them.
[00:55:02.237 --> 00:55:04.838]  I would never do to them what you've done to this guy.
[00:55:05.458 --> 00:55:11.501]  This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics.
[00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:17.364]  And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy.
[00:55:18.205 --> 00:55:19.845]  Are you a gang rapist?
[00:55:20.626 --> 00:55:20.766]  No.
[00:55:25.311 --> 00:55:28.614]  I cannot imagine what you and your family have gone through.
[00:55:29.294 --> 00:55:30.395]  Boy, y'all want power.
[00:55:30.455 --> 00:55:31.576]  God, I hope you never get it.
[00:55:32.276 --> 00:55:37.440]  I hope the American people can see through this sham, that you knew about it and you held it.
[00:55:38.021 --> 00:55:40.623]  You had no intention of protecting Dr. Ford.
[00:55:41.223 --> 00:55:41.524]  None!
[00:55:42.224 --> 00:55:44.146]  She's as much of a victim as you are.
[00:55:45.527 --> 00:55:48.489]  God, I hate to say it, because these have been my friends.
[00:55:49.289 --> 00:55:50.851]  But let me tell you, when it comes to this,
[00:55:52.657 --> 00:55:54.138]  You're looking for a fair process?
[00:55:54.858 --> 00:55:58.500]  You came to the wrong town at the wrong time, my friend.
[00:55:59.621 --> 00:56:01.422]  Do you consider this a job interview?
[00:56:03.523 --> 00:56:05.264]  The advice and consent role is like a job interview.
[00:56:05.284 --> 00:56:07.605]  Do you consider that you've been through a job interview?
[00:56:09.226 --> 00:56:14.109]  I've been through a process of advice and consent under the Constitution, which has... Would you say you've been through hell?
[00:56:15.289 --> 00:56:18.671]  I've been through hell and then some.
[00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:20.192]  This is not a job interview.
[00:56:20.834 --> 00:56:21.054]  Yeah.
[00:56:21.514 --> 00:56:22.235]  This is hell.
[00:56:22.935 --> 00:56:29.960]  This is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of this crap.
[00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:32.402]  Your high school yearbook.
[00:56:34.483 --> 00:56:37.766]  You have interacted with professional women all your life.
[00:56:38.026 --> 00:56:39.247]  Not one accusation.
[00:56:39.787 --> 00:56:44.150]  You're supposed to be Bill Cosby when you're a junior and senior in high school.
[00:56:45.511 --> 00:56:46.972]  And all of a sudden you got over it.
[00:56:46.992 --> 00:56:49.734]  It's been my understanding
[00:56:51.772 --> 00:56:56.939]  That if you drug women and rape them for two years in high school, you probably don't stop.
[00:56:58.281 --> 00:56:59.382]  Here's my understanding.
[00:57:00.063 --> 00:57:03.848]  If you lived a good life, people would recognize it.
[00:57:04.569 --> 00:57:07.653]  Like the American Bar Association has the gold standard.
[00:57:08.743 --> 00:57:11.804]  His integrity is absolutely unquestioned.
[00:57:12.585 --> 00:57:16.046]  He is the very circumspect in his personal conduct.
[00:57:16.486 --> 00:57:18.487]  Harbors no biases or prejudices.
[00:57:18.927 --> 00:57:20.348]  He's entirely ethical.
[00:57:20.708 --> 00:57:22.269]  Is a really decent person.
[00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:24.750]  He is warm, friendly, unassuming.
[00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:26.510]  He's the nicest person!
[00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:29.012]  The ABA.
[00:57:30.212 --> 00:57:32.373]  One thing I can tell you, you should be proud of.
[00:57:33.013 --> 00:57:35.074]  Ashley, you should be proud of this.
[00:57:35.914 --> 00:57:37.095]  That you raised a daughter.
[00:57:42.131 --> 00:57:48.395]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[00:57:48.435 --> 00:58:00.244]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[00:58:00.404 --> 00:58:06.306]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[00:58:06.386 --> 00:58:19.431]  Last month, the website called Right Wing Watch posted a report highlighting PayPal's continued business relationship with InfoWars, and the Washington Post also noted how business on the InfoWars stores was booming.
[00:58:19.671 --> 00:58:26.294]  PayPal is the latest big tech company to cut ties with far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, stealing a blow to win a founder out.
[00:58:26.474 --> 00:58:29.716]  It actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like they're being silenced.
[00:58:47.684 --> 00:58:50.385]  To social media censorship.
[00:58:50.425 --> 00:58:51.266]  That's the new thing.
[00:58:51.686 --> 00:58:55.847]  Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have all booted Jones off their platforms.
[00:58:55.867 --> 00:59:07.292]  PayPal on Thursday night informed InfoWars, which runs an online storefront that sells survival gear and herbal supplements, that it has 10 business days to find a new payment processor.
[00:59:07.432 --> 00:59:10.953]  You can't pick one person and say, well, we don't like what he's been saying.
[00:59:11.013 --> 00:59:11.353]  He's out.
[00:59:11.393 --> 00:59:14.975]  We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in.
[00:59:15.955 --> 00:59:17.056]  And you just can't do that.
[00:59:17.116 --> 00:59:28.006]  Jones hit back on his website saying the InfoWarsStore.com site had no political content and the move emphasizes how the decision was a broader attack on the InfoWars platform.
[00:59:28.026 --> 00:59:33.871]  A PayPal spokesperson says, quote, we undertook an extensive review of the InfoWars sites and found instances that promoted hate.
[00:59:34.091 --> 00:59:34.531]  Hate speech.
[00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:35.192]  Hate speech.
[00:59:35.272 --> 00:59:35.752]  Hate speech.
[00:59:35.852 --> 00:59:36.453]  Hate speech.
[00:59:36.553 --> 00:59:38.715]  Hate speech and bullying policies.
[00:59:44.628 --> 00:59:48.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:49.262 --> 00:59:50.566]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:59:57.429 --> 01:00:02.550]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:03.051 --> 01:00:05.471]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.932 --> 01:00:16.234]  This magic moment, so different and so new, was like any other.
[01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:19.875]  David Knight's riding a shotgun with us, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.895 --> 01:00:26.557]  Hackers came out yesterday and said that they would hack Facebook this weekend, that they would take over.
[01:00:29.514 --> 01:00:30.815]  Zuckerberg's account deleted.
[01:00:30.895 --> 01:00:32.656]  Well, it looks like that just started to happen.
[01:00:32.736 --> 01:00:35.758]  Attackers gained access to more than 50 million users accounts.
[01:00:36.559 --> 01:00:41.843]  Facebook has admitted that a security breach let hackers gain access to more than 50 million accounts.
[01:00:41.863 --> 01:00:48.527]  The monumental blunder was revealed late on Friday afternoon, three days after the attack actually took place.
[01:00:49.068 --> 01:00:51.630]  The folks that founded Instagram, that's fast growing,
[01:00:55.643 --> 01:00:56.704]  Facebook is collapsing.
[01:00:57.544 --> 01:00:59.685]  We have that from internal sources, but now it's in the news.
[01:01:01.706 --> 01:01:06.109]  And so it shows the whole thing is unraveling and the big heads of it are quietly unloading their stocks.
[01:01:06.189 --> 01:01:13.013]  Everybody should know that Facebook will be like MySpace within a year, in my educated opinion.
[01:01:13.133 --> 01:01:16.795]  And Google's going to get in a lot of trouble as well.
[01:01:16.975 --> 01:01:18.676]  So don't think all this is happening by accident.
[01:01:20.745 --> 01:01:30.692]  Go ahead and keep messing with the American people, keep siding with the Communist China and Russia, and the globalists, and see what happens, Google.
[01:01:31.853 --> 01:01:33.094]  See what happens, Apple.
[01:01:33.794 --> 01:01:34.835]  See what happens, Facebook.
[01:01:34.855 --> 01:01:35.536]  You're like, what do you mean?
[01:01:35.816 --> 01:01:37.577]  They're all saying Russia's the enemy all day.
[01:01:37.737 --> 01:01:38.378]  Oh yeah, right.
[01:01:38.718 --> 01:01:40.299]  They'll sell out to any foreign power.
[01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:41.160]  They hate this country.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.280]  That's who the left are.
[01:01:45.142 --> 01:01:46.323]  Do two more segments with...
[01:01:47.526 --> 01:01:54.827]  David Knight, and then I'm going to get to a bunch of clips, and then Owen Schroer is coming in here loaded for bear with a lot of big clips and other key things we're going to get to.
[01:01:54.887 --> 01:01:59.268]  But the process is, they need to pass this out of committee, and then they're saying it could go to a vote.
[01:01:59.288 --> 01:01:59.968]  It's early today.
[01:02:00.388 --> 01:02:01.509]  Some are saying next week.
[01:02:02.269 --> 01:02:03.769]  David, what do you have on that process?
[01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:05.549]  Because like you said, it seems nebulous.
[01:02:05.849 --> 01:02:06.830]  The whips don't know.
[01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.910]  Those are the guys, again, for both parties that go and count the votes and figure out what they've got.
[01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:14.051]  So I guess we're all just sitting here in rapt attention.
[01:02:15.103 --> 01:02:28.254]  Yeah, we don't really know, because we've got people who are red state Democrats, people like Manchin, a place, West Virginia, where it went heavily for President Trump, but he's a Democrat, so he is just sitting on the fence.
[01:02:28.294 --> 01:02:32.317]  He's not going to tell anybody how he's going to vote until he actually does it, so he's undecided.
[01:02:32.657 --> 01:02:40.840]  Then we've got flakes like Jeff Flake, and we've got liberal Republicans who are also doing the same thing.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.021]  Some of them have come out and said they're not going to do it.
[01:02:43.061 --> 01:02:44.642]  So it really is a toss-up.
[01:02:45.302 --> 01:02:47.303]  And I imagine this is in a state of flux.
[01:02:48.043 --> 01:02:53.765]  Those types of people are going to stick their finger into the wind as to what they're going to do and who's going to cut the best deal for them.
[01:02:53.785 --> 01:02:55.466]  You've got a lot of people like Jeff Flake who
[01:02:56.326 --> 01:03:00.249]  Why do you think Flake signaled that there's no evidence that he did any of this and he's going to sign the due process?
[01:03:00.329 --> 01:03:01.030]  I think that's honorable.
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:14.981]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:15.221 --> 01:03:18.384]  And he's getting a lot of attack for that, so they're going to put pressure on him for the long of the wait.
[01:03:18.464 --> 01:03:19.485]  But that's how the law works!
[01:03:19.966 --> 01:03:24.470]  If people don't have evidence or witnesses and their witnesses say the opposite, they're discredited!
[01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.652]  I think people are being far too nice to Ford.
[01:03:27.013 --> 01:03:31.837]  I mean, if she had a bunch of witnesses saying any of this, I'd say, well, it's not rape, but it's not good behavior.
[01:03:32.218 --> 01:03:33.199]  Is there any other evidence of this?
[01:03:33.259 --> 01:03:34.300]  And maybe it disqualifies him.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.264]  But they don't have any witnesses to even the parties he said happening.
[01:03:39.428 --> 01:03:39.728]  That's right.
[01:03:39.768 --> 01:03:49.256]  Well, she talks about her lifelong friend, Leland, who, through her lawyer, gave a statement saying that, uh, I have absolutely no recollection of this, any of this.
[01:03:49.316 --> 01:03:51.078]  I never, I don't know Brett Kavanaugh.
[01:03:51.098 --> 01:03:52.399]  I never saw him at a party and so forth.
[01:03:52.459 --> 01:03:58.324]  And so her response to all that and that, uh, questioning yesterday was to say, well, you know, she sent me a text and said she's so sorry about this.
[01:03:58.384 --> 01:04:04.930]  It's like, yeah, she's sorry because her lawyer advised her not to commit perjury and go to jail for five years because they're not going to protect
[01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:09.853]  Somebody that commits perjury like that, like they protected James Clapper when he committed perjury.
[01:04:10.273 --> 01:04:16.258]  So, yeah, she's not going to talk about that online and maybe send her a message saying, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry I can't lie for you, can we still be friends?
[01:04:16.458 --> 01:04:20.401]  She doesn't have anything to back her up, absolutely nothing.
[01:04:20.721 --> 01:04:28.726]  Just as Ted Cruz said, we typically have somebody say one thing, the other person says the other thing, so you look at ancillary evidence, you look at witnesses, she has none.
[01:04:28.826 --> 01:04:32.089]  That's why the due process is important, the presumption of innocence is important.
[01:04:33.274 --> 01:04:34.895]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:35.075 --> 01:04:39.176]  We are watching, set for the vote to go out of committee and go to the full House, full Senate.
[01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:45.498]  We're going to be tracking it all today on Alex Jones, David Knight riding shotgun, Owen Schroyer coming up on this Friday edition.
[01:04:45.758 --> 01:04:48.819]  Live, continuous coverage of the Kavanaugh Circus.
[01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:53.561]  Look at that.
[01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:56.322]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[01:04:56.342 --> 01:04:58.623]  That's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[01:04:58.923 --> 01:04:59.683]  We didn't do that.
[01:05:01.343 --> 01:05:05.445]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[01:05:05.865 --> 01:05:07.526]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:05:08.106 --> 01:05:16.650]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:05:17.131 --> 01:05:18.811]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:19.972]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:05:20.652 --> 01:05:23.173]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:05:23.213 --> 01:05:24.314]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:05:25.094 --> 01:05:28.016]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:35.920]  Look it up.
[01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:43.044]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[01:05:43.084 --> 01:05:47.927]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[01:05:48.407 --> 01:05:51.009]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4store.com.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:08.866]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:09.846 --> 01:06:17.532]  Well, I looked into the tweet that Michael Savage put out.
[01:06:17.552 --> 01:06:21.514]  We're talking to Savage right now about getting him to pop on the show today.
[01:06:21.534 --> 01:06:22.295]  He's got a sore throat.
[01:06:23.274 --> 01:06:25.034]  If he normally only does his show, he has a sore throat.
[01:06:25.054 --> 01:06:28.595]  But we may be getting him on, obviously, because he knows time is of the essence.
[01:06:28.635 --> 01:06:29.856]  But we're going to talk about this next segment.
[01:06:31.716 --> 01:06:36.297]  The question is not if Ford is connected to the CIA and leftist groups in the CIA.
[01:06:36.818 --> 01:06:38.938]  The fact is, are they in control of her?
[01:06:40.678 --> 01:06:42.219]  That's pretty damning evidence.
[01:06:42.359 --> 01:06:45.400]  I mean, this lady runs the internship for the CIA.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:50.001]  When you talk about the CIA, it's not like the actual military that does fighting and killing.
[01:06:51.246 --> 01:07:04.876]  You've got all these operatives and analysts and people that basically just spy on Americans and engage in mafia corruption to make sure that small businesses never take off, independent companies never take off.
[01:07:05.177 --> 01:07:08.880]  They want to make sure that the economy consolidates, that we're poor and under their control.
[01:07:09.727 --> 01:07:18.111]  That's in the WikiLeaks, is that their main job is to transfer jobs offshore, destroy the United States infrastructure, destroy the family.
[01:07:18.131 --> 01:07:23.354]  There have been declassified documents where the leftist arm of the CIA put out ugly architecture, ugly art.
[01:07:23.954 --> 01:07:26.575]  I mean, their job is to create transgender children.
[01:07:26.935 --> 01:07:28.276]  Their job is to end fertility.
[01:07:28.796 --> 01:07:29.897]  This is all declassified.
[01:07:30.217 --> 01:07:31.398]  That's the leftist CIA.
[01:07:32.358 --> 01:07:36.161]  Not the one you see in movies, you know, or MI6 James Bond stuff.
[01:07:36.782 --> 01:07:38.083]  That's not.
[01:07:38.643 --> 01:07:46.870]  It's chicken neck, weird dingbats like her and her family that just sit inside the CIA and just engorging, you know, themselves on the system.
[01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:49.312]  So it's a club.
[01:07:49.392 --> 01:07:50.413]  It's a game.
[01:07:51.474 --> 01:07:57.759]  And I knew she had connections, but holy Toledo, when I read all these and checked them during the last few breaks, it's pretty damning.
[01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:02.233]  We're going to be looking at that coming up.
[01:08:02.653 --> 01:08:04.974]  But I mean, she says she has PTSD.
[01:08:07.056 --> 01:08:17.722]  She says she has PTSD from someone throwing her on a bed and rolling around for 10 seconds, compared to what women go through in general with real sexual assaults and childbirth and just everything.
[01:08:17.802 --> 01:08:20.243]  It's just not credible.
[01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:21.284]  And there's no witnesses.
[01:08:21.344 --> 01:08:21.944]  It's insane.
[01:08:22.885 --> 01:08:25.786]  David Knight, I want to go to a few minutes of Kavanaugh's opening statement.
[01:08:25.866 --> 01:08:26.947]  I thought it was powerful.
[01:08:27.487 --> 01:08:28.448]  I thought it was very real.
[01:08:30.113 --> 01:08:32.295]  I'm sure they made fun of him because his face was getting contorted.
[01:08:32.315 --> 01:08:33.376]  He was trying not to cry.
[01:08:34.417 --> 01:08:37.340]  Because, you know, this guy's into being a goody two-shoes.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.843]  And he's all into being in control of his life.
[01:08:41.143 --> 01:08:41.903]  Top of his class.
[01:08:43.945 --> 01:08:44.426]  You name it.
[01:08:44.966 --> 01:08:46.728]  And, I mean, this is very destructive.
[01:08:46.748 --> 01:08:49.810]  This is, when you're false accused, it makes you very, very angry.
[01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:51.672]  But it also makes you very, very sad for your children.
[01:08:52.032 --> 01:08:54.094]  I mean, you've been false accused working here.
[01:08:54.154 --> 01:08:55.115]  I've been false accused.
[01:08:56.135 --> 01:08:56.215]  Yeah.
[01:08:56.415 --> 01:08:58.978]  We've experienced things that are just absolutely incredible.
[01:08:59.018 --> 01:08:59.818]  We're not whining.
[01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:02.901]  It just makes us know we must defeat these people.
[01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:14.191]  So, you know, maybe I'm biased because I've been lied about so much by the left that I see a story that has, you know, thousands of holes in it and there's a statute of limitations and due process and innocents are proven guilty and I just say this is a fraud.
[01:09:14.211 --> 01:09:14.612]  What do you say?
[01:09:15.558 --> 01:09:19.062]  Well I say, I heard that Alex, and I heard it on my way home yesterday.
[01:09:19.082 --> 01:09:20.844]  I was listening to it live.
[01:09:21.704 --> 01:09:24.848]  And I was very moved by what was happening to him.
[01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:26.930]  Again, as you said, we've experienced some of this.
[01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:33.817]  I've had former friends that even before all this stuff started were saying, you gotta take InfoWars off or I'm gonna get off of Facebook.
[01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:35.178]  And I wrote him a long letter.
[01:09:36.487 --> 01:09:43.212]  Explaining to them why the First Amendment is far more important than their political prejudice and what they're trashing.
[01:09:43.752 --> 01:09:47.474]  And that's really, you know, when we look at things, it's worthwhile to get upset about things.
[01:09:47.534 --> 01:09:56.500]  And when I looked at the testimony of Dr. Ford, I didn't find her credible because I didn't find her upset about this.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.522]  I found him credible because I believe he's an innocent man.
[01:09:59.642 --> 01:10:00.863]  And he was very angry about that.
[01:10:00.903 --> 01:10:02.424]  But then we look at what Jimmy Kimmel was saying.
[01:10:03.224 --> 01:10:05.567]  So at halftime, it was riveting to watch.
[01:10:05.587 --> 01:10:06.889]  She was very credible.
[01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:09.431]  I didn't find it credible on the details or anything else.
[01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:17.320]  I understand that she was able to get through that because we had this prosecutor who was kind of dithering and not drawing any conclusions.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:21.845]  She would come in and ask a few questions, but before she could get to anything and finish up on it,
[01:10:22.406 --> 01:10:26.109]  They would send it over for five minutes to the Democrats to cover for her.
[01:10:26.369 --> 01:10:29.691]  So at halftime, says Jimmy Kimmel, it seemed like the Democrats were up by 32 to nothing.
[01:10:29.731 --> 01:10:35.095]  Then Brett Kavanaugh sat down and delivered an impassioned 45-minute speech, delivered like a frat out of hell.
[01:10:35.195 --> 01:10:36.456]  Loud, angry, and tearful.
[01:10:36.936 --> 01:10:38.277]  Yeah, because he's an innocent man!
[01:10:39.389 --> 01:10:40.490]  And I don't know.
[01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:45.292]  If you're that prejudiced about this, then that's really what you're going to see.
[01:10:46.052 --> 01:10:49.634]  Well, David, I can say to you that you've seen the lies of the press about us that are whole cloth.
[01:10:49.994 --> 01:10:52.175]  I mean, do I wear Nazi tennis shoes?
[01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:53.795]  No, you don't.
[01:10:53.975 --> 01:10:54.156]  No.
[01:10:54.236 --> 01:10:54.976]  Do we run around?
[01:10:54.996 --> 01:10:57.017]  Have you ever heard anyone say the N-word at the office?
[01:10:57.617 --> 01:10:57.837]  No.
[01:10:58.157 --> 01:10:59.418]  And what would you do if you did?
[01:11:00.782 --> 01:11:02.163]  Well, I would push back on that.
[01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:07.345]  I mean, this is absolutely incredible, but, you know, they put out these slurs, and that's the whole key.
[01:11:07.386 --> 01:11:16.410]  We go back and you look at these gang rape statements, and they are not pushing on this Avenatti witness or victim or whatever.
[01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:17.311]  They're not pushing on that.
[01:11:17.571 --> 01:11:20.893]  But they already threw that stuff out there, and it's already in the public's mind.
[01:11:20.933 --> 01:11:26.696]  And they said he was trying to rape women on boats, and there were fistfights in Colorado, and they now admit it's all hoaxes!
[01:11:27.469 --> 01:11:27.849]  That's right.
[01:11:27.969 --> 01:11:34.871]  Multiple anonymous allegations coming, two of them at least, coming through Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat Senator out of Rhode Island.
[01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:37.372]  He really is worse than Cory Booker when it comes to this.
[01:11:37.672 --> 01:11:41.254]  Let's play a clip here and then I'll get into how the whole confirmation is going to work.
[01:11:41.594 --> 01:11:45.175]  They're set today to vote out of the Judiciary Committee and sometimes early next week.
[01:11:46.283 --> 01:11:55.525]  In the full Senate, which I think they should just get that vote going now, because we'll talk in a moment about what you think is coming in the next three or four days before the full vote.
[01:11:55.565 --> 01:11:56.945]  I mean, who knows the Democrats will pull.
[01:11:56.965 --> 01:11:57.306]  They're so happy.
[01:11:57.326 --> 01:11:58.606]  Yeah, they're going to be working tomorrow.
[01:11:59.926 --> 01:12:00.446]  It's insane.
[01:12:00.726 --> 01:12:04.807]  Let's go ahead and roll a clip of the beginning of Judge Kavanaugh's statement.
[01:12:06.148 --> 01:12:07.548]  This is a circus.
[01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:12.470]  The consequences will extend long past my nomination.
[01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:16.052]  The consequences will be with us for decades.
[01:12:17.313 --> 01:12:28.819]  This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country.
[01:12:30.039 --> 01:12:36.783]  And as we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around, comes around.
[01:12:39.435 --> 01:12:41.036]  I am an optimistic guy.
[01:12:42.317 --> 01:12:48.201]  I always try to be on the sunrise side of the mountain, to be optimistic about the day that is coming.
[01:12:49.181 --> 01:12:53.684]  But today, I have to say that I fear for the future.
[01:12:56.066 --> 01:13:04.071]  Last time I was here, I told this committee that a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure.
[01:13:04.892 --> 01:13:07.774]  I said I was such a judge, and I am.
[01:13:08.897 --> 01:13:12.099]  I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:13.941]  You've tried hard.
[01:13:15.342 --> 01:13:16.463]  You've given it your all.
[01:13:17.483 --> 01:13:18.984]  No one can question your effort.
[01:13:20.085 --> 01:13:28.011]  But your coordinated and well-funded effort to destroy my good name and destroy my family will not drive me out.
[01:13:29.292 --> 01:13:34.136]  The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out.
[01:13:35.497 --> 01:13:37.178]  You may defeat me in the final vote,
[01:13:38.575 --> 01:13:39.996]  But you'll never get me to quit.
[01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:41.197]  Never.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.601]  I'm here today to tell the truth.
[01:13:47.182 --> 01:13:49.084]  I've never sexually assaulted anyone.
[01:13:49.804 --> 01:13:50.685]  Not in high school.
[01:13:51.206 --> 01:13:52.046]  Not in college.
[01:13:52.847 --> 01:13:53.367]  Not ever.
[01:13:55.429 --> 01:13:57.331]  Sexual assault is horrific.
[01:13:58.692 --> 01:14:10.595]  One of my closest friends to this day is a woman who was sexually abused and who in the 1990s when we were in our 30s confided in me about the abuse and sought my advice.
[01:14:11.515 --> 01:14:13.655]  I was one of the only people she consulted.
[01:14:15.516 --> 01:14:20.177]  Allegations of sexual assault must always be taken seriously, always.
[01:14:21.197 --> 01:14:24.578]  Those who make allegations always deserve to be heard.
[01:14:26.434 --> 01:14:32.519]  At the same time, the person who is the subject of the allegations also deserves to be heard.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.563]  Due process is a foundation of the American rule of law.
[01:14:38.804 --> 01:14:41.627]  Due process means listening to both sides.
[01:14:44.289 --> 01:14:53.777]  I'm not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.
[01:14:55.117 --> 01:14:59.500]  But I have never done this to her or to anyone.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.981]  That's not who I am.
[01:15:02.942 --> 01:15:04.322]  It is not who I was.
[01:15:05.603 --> 01:15:07.404]  I am innocent of this charge.
[01:15:09.265 --> 01:15:12.968]  I intend no ill will to Dr. Ford and her family.
[01:15:13.808 --> 01:15:20.072]  The other night, Ashley and my daughter Liza said their prayers, and little Liza, all of 10 years old,
[01:15:27.495 --> 01:15:28.436]  At a human level, I am not
[01:15:55.316 --> 01:15:59.759]  I'm pleased by being demonized by every major globalist publication in the world.
[01:16:00.659 --> 01:16:04.141]  By all the censorship, all the banning, all the demonization, all the attacks.
[01:16:04.201 --> 01:16:11.005]  But at a gut level, a spiritual level, I know that I've been effective telling the truth and I'm proud of what I've done.
[01:16:11.725 --> 01:16:15.568]  But I'm even more importantly proud of what you the listeners and viewers have done.
[01:16:16.688 --> 01:16:30.194]  The reason the globalists and the communist Chinese, the authoritarian EU, and all these tyrannical corporations and the America-hating Hollywood are targeting Infowars is because they see it as the spirit of Americana.
[01:16:31.035 --> 01:16:32.876]  Not just because of me, but because of you.
[01:16:33.716 --> 01:16:36.137]  It's a place where they see victory for humanity.
[01:16:36.557 --> 01:16:38.178]  A place where they see you in power.
[01:16:38.818 --> 01:16:42.280]  A place where they see you taking control of your destiny.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.683]  I've had more than 30 major tech companies the last six weeks ban me off all their platforms.
[01:16:47.743 --> 01:16:51.085]  And now I've had credit card companies and PayPal and everybody else do it as well.
[01:16:52.045 --> 01:16:59.550]  And then horrible, monstrous, war criminal Nazi collaborators like George Soros openly celebrating what they've done.
[01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:03.493]  People say, hey, you're starting to really lose in the world.
[01:17:03.793 --> 01:17:04.213]  No, I'm not.
[01:17:04.994 --> 01:17:07.255]  I came to expose the corrupt system.
[01:17:08.136 --> 01:17:10.998]  I came to try to change all this just like you did.
[01:17:11.738 --> 01:17:12.239]  I love God.
[01:17:13.604 --> 01:17:27.169]  And so I have pure confidence at the end of the day that the reason I'm under such unmitigated, such unprecedented, incredible attack is because I'm telling the truth.
[01:17:27.989 --> 01:17:34.411]  And because I am accurately getting into the real issues that the globalists don't want discussed.
[01:17:35.231 --> 01:17:40.633]  We have trailblazed, we have chronicled on every major front
[01:17:41.783 --> 01:17:44.383]  All the major issues of our day.
[01:17:44.403 --> 01:17:53.045]  And not because we were the smartest people around, but because we were actually willing to cover what the facts showed, despite the fact we'd be demonized and attacked.
[01:17:54.005 --> 01:17:56.106]  You see, that's why more people don't tell the truth.
[01:17:56.646 --> 01:18:00.947]  It's because they know that when they do tell the truth, they get persecuted.
[01:18:01.907 --> 01:18:06.968]  But when everybody sells out to persecution, you have stagnation, you have tyranny.
[01:18:07.588 --> 01:18:08.788]  So I'm betting on you.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:10.741]  I believe in you.
[01:18:11.322 --> 01:18:18.410]  And I believe that if you are given the real information, or at least pointed out that there's other information out there, that you'll make the right decision.
[01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:19.691]  And that's what's happened here.
[01:18:20.672 --> 01:18:27.460]  So, yes, they are taking away our advertising capability, they're taking away our banking capability, they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:28.961]  But while we still do have banking,
[01:18:29.862 --> 01:18:38.466]  We can hold out for months and months without your support, but I'd like to know and have an idea how far out, like the Alamo, that you want us to basically hold out.
[01:18:39.226 --> 01:18:45.149]  Because I'm gonna go to the end, but I'm using how much support we get right now as a gauge of just how committed you are.
[01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:47.090]  And I'm not bitching at you, I'm not complaining.
[01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:51.912]  I'm just simply saying, if you like what you've seen so far, we're now right up to the thick of the battle.
[01:18:52.512 --> 01:18:53.953]  We're right up to the third act here.
[01:18:53.973 --> 01:18:55.834]  We're right up to the crucible.
[01:18:56.814 --> 01:18:59.335]  And now is the time to really pick which side you're on.
[01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:03.136]  So, InfoMoreStore.com has credit card payment.
[01:19:03.156 --> 01:19:04.437]  We still have PayPal for now.
[01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:11.659]  You can get great supplements, great books, great videos, great water filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, high-quality organic coffee.
[01:19:11.699 --> 01:19:12.159]  It's all there.
[01:19:12.679 --> 01:19:13.880]  You can get Patriot Points.
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:14.760]  You can get free shipping.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.201]  There's so many great deals.
[01:19:16.261 --> 01:19:17.141]  But regardless,
[01:19:18.749 --> 01:19:27.597]  Whatever you do, just check out the site today and realize, without you financially supporting us, they took our sponsors a long time ago, we're not gonna be here.
[01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:29.018]  They see M4s as a symbol.
[01:19:29.418 --> 01:19:34.763]  They believe they can shut us down, they will demoralize you, and that humanity's awakening will fail.
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:39.342]  I think that they're wrong, and I think you're going to take action.
[01:19:39.702 --> 01:19:46.246]  So pray for us, spread the word, spread the articles, the videos, and visit InfoWarsTour.com, and we will weather the storm and come out on the other side.
[01:19:46.787 --> 01:19:49.088]  But without you, we will be defeated, we will be shut down.
[01:19:49.489 --> 01:19:51.550]  So our fate is now up to you.
[01:19:55.913 --> 01:19:58.555]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.528 --> 01:20:16.670]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:22.393]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:26.176 --> 01:20:32.901]  So we know with Julian Assange that one of the two women he reportedly had sex with had done work for the CIA.
[01:20:37.017 --> 01:20:47.622]  And you've got Michael Savage pointing out some of these connections, and we have a Zero Hedge article that's excellent from a week ago that we're going to repost in full to InfoWars.com right now.
[01:20:48.382 --> 01:20:52.644]  CIA honey trap set Kavanaugh accuser's CIA ties.
[01:20:53.525 --> 01:21:04.810]  Now I knew that her lawyer, Michael Bromwich, works for Soros, works for the neocons, is the lawyer for Andrew McCabe, tied into Mueller.
[01:21:06.324 --> 01:21:09.266]  And he's the one sitting there basically quarterbacking a lot of this.
[01:21:09.326 --> 01:21:22.512]  But when I then actually read and went through the links, her dad's high-level deep state CIA in DC, she's the recruiter at the university for the interns of the CIA, which they then call Google.
[01:21:22.853 --> 01:21:24.233]  I've explained that Google is the CIA.
[01:21:24.333 --> 01:21:28.656]  And that's why they're now rogue against our own military, rogue against the Pentagon.
[01:21:29.876 --> 01:21:34.979]  They won't even give AI technology that we paid for to the military, but they're giving it to Communist China.
[01:21:36.175 --> 01:21:39.098]  I mean, the belligerence is incredible.
[01:21:39.779 --> 01:21:46.686]  And so David Knight's riding shotgun here with me, but I was going over this, and it is unbelievable.
[01:21:47.287 --> 01:21:49.569]  Her father has worked, still works for the CIA.
[01:21:52.212 --> 01:21:56.236]  And then they've got major congressional hearings and testimonies about it all.
[01:22:00.205 --> 01:22:20.699]  Ralph Blasi, Jr., a proven CI operative who from, and then it goes through, was vice president of the National Savings and Trust in Washington, D.C., a CIA black budget bank set up for being 100 paces from the White House and whom in 98 was taken over by SunTrust Bank, whose majority share owner is CIA-linked investment BlackRock.
[01:22:21.159 --> 01:22:21.860]  So this isn't just
[01:22:22.788 --> 01:22:23.548]  Low-level stuff.
[01:22:23.568 --> 01:22:25.609]  This is the actual blue-blood, white-shoe-boy stuff.
[01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:33.793]  The importance of knowing the CIA banking connections to Ralph G. Blasi, Jr., the report explains, is due to the outbreak of what is known as CIA bank war.
[01:22:33.813 --> 01:22:36.034]  And then it goes through all the declassifications.
[01:22:36.494 --> 01:22:38.935]  Vice President of Business Development of Redcoats, Inc.
[01:22:39.415 --> 01:22:40.776]  That's Ralph G. Blasi, Jr.
[01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:42.977]  So the dad, the brother, all of it.
[01:22:43.598 --> 01:22:44.618]  All of it's called Redcoats.
[01:22:45.179 --> 01:22:49.882]  Admiralty Security Services, armed security for deep state elites in D.C.
[01:22:50.403 --> 01:22:52.084]  that is overseen by Redcoats Inc.
[01:22:52.184 --> 01:22:55.767]  co-founder and vice chairman William F. Peel III.
[01:22:55.787 --> 01:22:57.268]  I mean, I know all these names.
[01:22:57.728 --> 01:22:57.968]  U.S.
[01:22:57.988 --> 01:22:59.910]  government contracts extending.
[01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:01.651]  And it goes through 2023.
[01:23:04.393 --> 01:23:08.456]  And then it goes into how the Assange was set up and everything that she does.
[01:23:08.476 --> 01:23:09.097]  I mean, read this.
[01:23:10.387 --> 01:23:15.351]  Is Dr. Ford deeply tied to the CIA, asks Michael Savage.
[01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:16.592]  Who is Dr. Blasey Ford?
[01:23:16.632 --> 01:23:22.957]  Well, besides being a professor at the off-brand university, she also works at a major university down the street from Palo Alto.
[01:23:23.297 --> 01:23:27.661]  She just so happens to head up the CIA undergraduate internship program at Stanford University.
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:37.545]  Her brother, Ralph III, used to work for the international law firm Baker-Hostetler, the firm created Fusion GPS, the company who wrote the Russian dossier.
[01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:40.506]  They later admitted it was only a collection of field interviews.
[01:23:40.847 --> 01:23:43.508]  Baker-Hostetler is located in the same building where the CIA operates.
[01:23:43.788 --> 01:23:48.231]  Three companies called Redcoats, Inc., Admiral Security Services, Data Watch.
[01:23:48.951 --> 01:23:51.072]  They are operated by Ralph Blasi II.
[01:23:51.713 --> 01:23:53.353]  He is the father of Christine and Ralph III.
[01:23:54.574 --> 01:23:58.295]  I mean, David Knight, I didn't know until later that she'd headed up the recruitment program.
[01:23:58.315 --> 01:24:00.656]  No wonder she's got young Google interns living in her house.
[01:24:00.676 --> 01:24:01.716]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:24:18.712 --> 01:24:33.477]  Well, you know, Alex, is it any surprise that the CIA, they refer to themselves as redcoats in this context here, is it any surprise that the CIA that has spent decades on arranging coups and overthrowing governments abroad are doing it now at home?
[01:24:33.617 --> 01:24:36.258]  I mean, we were warned by this, by our founders, by Madison.
[01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:41.940]  He said if tyranny comes to America, it will come in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:50.424]  They have been given a black budget, they have been given carte blanche, they have been given our liberties, so they can fight foreign enemies abroad.
[01:24:50.464 --> 01:25:00.268]  And yet now what we see is that the CIA is nothing other than a self-interested group trying to fight Americans here domestically to overthrow our own government.
[01:25:00.328 --> 01:25:01.589]  And this lady's whole family are...
[01:25:02.069 --> 01:25:07.296]  Our deep state CIA, and then she's working with them, and then no one's even making an issue out of this.
[01:25:07.797 --> 01:25:08.838]  This is unbelievable.
[01:25:08.858 --> 01:25:16.989]  But of course, this ditzy, stupid person can only operate and live within the confines of a deep state swamp where her daddy feeds her.
[01:25:17.489 --> 01:25:18.611]  I mean, this is disgusting.
[01:25:19.465 --> 01:25:20.625]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:20.745 --> 01:25:26.668]  And again, no basis for proof, but they don't need any basis because these are the types of tactics that we see all the time.
[01:25:26.888 --> 01:25:29.949]  And quite frankly, you know, Alex, when I look at Lindsey Graham, I agree with him.
[01:25:30.049 --> 01:25:31.870]  I mean, this is shameful what has happened.
[01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:35.331]  I wish that the Republicans had not countenanced it.
[01:25:35.991 --> 01:25:40.034]  Or been accomplices in it with Roy Moore, because that established this precedent.
[01:25:40.314 --> 01:25:41.975]  You go along with that and you get more of it.
[01:25:42.015 --> 01:25:42.916]  They saw that it worked.
[01:25:42.956 --> 01:25:57.025]  They could make, they could pad a he said, she said situation with a bunch of unsubstantiated, crazy over-the-top... But I think they've gone too far, because when you've got Graham and all these others that are establishment starting to flip out, this isn't fake.
[01:25:57.865 --> 01:26:00.268]  People know the deep state wants to destroy America.
[01:26:00.308 --> 01:26:03.591]  It has a hard-on for it, and it's gone too far, and people want it out.
[01:26:03.651 --> 01:26:04.352]  We want it gone.
[01:26:04.572 --> 01:26:05.634]  They're in the way of progress.
[01:26:05.654 --> 01:26:06.635]  They're allied with China.
[01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:14.803]  Google arrogantly not giving AI technology we paid for to the US military, but giving it to the CHICOM military is treason, David!
[01:26:15.043 --> 01:26:17.046]  I mean, we have to deal with these people now.
[01:26:17.841 --> 01:26:18.201]  That's right.
[01:26:18.642 --> 01:26:28.852]  And yet, as we see, you know, we heard Ted Cruz or I guess it was Lindsey Graham maybe talking about in the hearing yesterday, talking about the excellent report that the American Bar Association had given Kavanaugh initially.
[01:26:29.373 --> 01:26:33.978]  And now they are coming back, even though, you know, we had we played this multiple times.
[01:26:34.258 --> 01:26:39.719]  Played it again today, Joe Biden saying 27 years ago that the FBI doesn't have anything to do with this.
[01:26:39.779 --> 01:26:42.820]  I mean, they've already had now eight, nine hours of testimony from them.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.000]  What's the FBI going to give us?
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.800]  They're just going to give us that testimony again in a condensed form.
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:48.101]  They're not going to draw any conclusions.
[01:26:48.181 --> 01:26:51.621]  And yet the American Bar Association is urging a delay on this now.
[01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:54.062]  And so this is the difficulty with this.
[01:26:54.082 --> 01:26:56.082]  They're going to have this vote today to get it out of committee.
[01:26:56.122 --> 01:27:00.083]  Tomorrow they're going to have a procedural vote, but they're not going to really vote on this in the full Senate until next week.
[01:27:00.723 --> 01:27:03.226]  And a lot of things can happen in this new cycle as it continues.
[01:27:03.246 --> 01:27:04.468]  What do you think they're going to pull?
[01:27:04.788 --> 01:27:07.011]  I mean, I think they see this as their Waterloo.
[01:27:07.372 --> 01:27:09.074]  If they don't win this, I think they're going to lose.
[01:27:09.114 --> 01:27:15.062]  They're all hands on deck, no holds barred, totally committed, 39 days out.
[01:27:15.242 --> 01:27:16.424]  I think they're going to pull something big.
[01:27:17.659 --> 01:27:23.301]  Well, yeah, and again, the only thing that we've got really going in our favor, of course, it's not going to work with Jeff Flake.
[01:27:23.641 --> 01:27:25.082]  Flake is going to have to vote with Republicans.
[01:27:25.122 --> 01:27:28.823]  He said he's going to do it, but then, you know, they're saying, well, he's over here talking to this guy.
[01:27:28.863 --> 01:27:29.683]  We'll see what happens.
[01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:31.704]  I don't trust him until I actually see him vote.
[01:27:32.364 --> 01:27:33.785]  If he votes, they get it out of the committee.
[01:27:34.585 --> 01:27:54.662]  And then you've got a situation where these people want to draw this to a conclusion one way or the other because early next week they have to go home and they've got to get started campaigning because they're getting very close to the election and you've got a lot of these people like Manchin who are going to be going into areas that are heavily went for President Trump and Trump is going to say they shut down my pick
[01:27:55.242 --> 01:28:04.494]  And a lot of these places are conservative enough that they don't like these kind of shenanigans about he said, she said, without any due process, without any evidence, trashing a man's life like this.
[01:28:04.534 --> 01:28:09.060]  So that's going to be very difficult for them to immediately leave this and go home and try to win an election.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.262]  So that's some pressure on them from that side.
[01:28:11.903 --> 01:28:13.886]  Otherwise we'd be in really dire straits here.
[01:28:15.455 --> 01:28:16.176]  Well, I know this.
[01:28:16.276 --> 01:28:19.298]  It's a riveting time to be alive and an incredible time to be on air.
[01:28:19.318 --> 01:28:20.880]  And I'm just praying for Judge Kavanaugh.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:21.641]  I'm praying for you.
[01:28:21.681 --> 01:28:22.541]  I'm praying for the whole crew.
[01:28:22.902 --> 01:28:25.884]  I'm praying for the audience, because now is the time to be getting on our knees to God.
[01:28:26.365 --> 01:28:28.046]  Owen Schroeder is coming in with me next segment.
[01:28:28.126 --> 01:28:29.067]  A great job, David.
[01:28:29.087 --> 01:28:33.371]  And, of course, we'll have a lot of live coverage throughout the weekend, not just a Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:34.072]  on the regular show.
[01:28:34.112 --> 01:28:36.234]  But we're going to be doing some live programming this weekend.
[01:28:36.254 --> 01:28:37.935]  And you'll be back on Monday, 8 a.m.
[01:28:38.015 --> 01:28:39.617]  Infowars.com for its last show.
[01:28:39.897 --> 01:28:40.818]  Thank you so much, David Knight.
[01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:42.090]  Thank you, Alan.
[01:28:42.930 --> 01:28:49.513]  All right, we'll be back with Owen Schroyer, and we're gonna open the phones up, too, and a lot more on this Friday edition and a bunch of other clips.
[01:28:52.454 --> 01:28:56.135]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[01:28:56.415 --> 01:28:59.836]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[01:29:00.197 --> 01:29:09.580]  This research includes 20-plus safety reports and test series, as well as the first-ever double-blind, FDA-cleared human ingestion toxicity
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:10.621]  Study.
[01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:13.664]  This formula is 24 ppm.
[01:29:14.025 --> 01:29:15.807]  That's 32 ppm version.
[01:29:16.147 --> 01:29:18.970]  Is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:21.393]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[01:29:21.673 --> 01:29:26.338]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[01:29:26.358 --> 01:29:26.919]  Ah, you don't want that.
[01:29:27.319 --> 01:29:31.122]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[01:29:31.342 --> 01:29:34.024]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[01:29:34.284 --> 01:29:37.586]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[01:29:37.967 --> 01:29:43.270]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:47.473]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[01:29:48.334 --> 01:29:51.116]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[01:29:54.434 --> 01:29:59.881]  Leo Zegami is somebody who has broken hundreds of stories years before they come out.
[01:30:00.021 --> 01:30:07.310]  He's got the exclusive leozegami.com that Alexander Soros, now taking the mantle over from his father, forms shadow government with Obama.
[01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:10.294]  Leo Zegami, obviously this is critical information.
[01:30:10.374 --> 01:30:12.977]  People need to listen very, very, very carefully.
[01:30:13.177 --> 01:30:27.900]  The National Democratic Redistricting Committee has been shaped by the Soros as a new toy for the political relaunch of Obama and Michelle Obama, so the Obamas.
[01:30:28.221 --> 01:30:31.361]  This motto they have is also quite meaningful.
[01:30:31.461 --> 01:30:34.262]  The political system is rigged.
[01:30:34.322 --> 01:30:35.402]  They have rigged it.
[01:30:35.662 --> 01:30:36.603]  Of course it's rigged.
[01:30:37.003 --> 01:30:38.363]  But by them, not by us.
[01:30:38.963 --> 01:30:41.045]  And instead they are throwing... Look, notice that.
[01:30:41.085 --> 01:30:43.086]  They're calling themselves the resistance.
[01:30:43.786 --> 01:30:50.151]  Everything we've said, they're now becoming that, then banning me to then step in as the body snatcher into the body.
[01:30:50.431 --> 01:30:51.832]  This is really ridiculous.
[01:30:51.932 --> 01:31:06.702]  I think that people should check out Alexander Soros as the new, really, puppet master of this new world order, because he's arriving from an experience as chairman, of course, of the Open Society.
[01:31:07.522 --> 01:31:18.385]  He's been also indicated this year in the famous World Economic Forum as one of the young global leaders of 2018.
[01:31:18.825 --> 01:31:22.906]  So he's the upcoming figure that will replace George Soros.
[01:31:22.966 --> 01:31:24.507]  This means basically
[01:31:24.867 --> 01:31:26.789]  That we're never going to get rid of Soros.
[01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:42.020]  Father, son, this family is going to continue pushing their New World Order and their democratic, progressive, liberal ways and of course in support of Pope Francis.
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:48.045]  The words that were published on Twitter on the 22nd of September by Alexander Soros are very revealing.
[01:31:48.265 --> 01:31:53.429]  He says, it was great to welcome President Barack Obama back into my home.
[01:31:54.289 --> 01:31:58.891]  ...this week and introduce him on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
[01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:00.933]  He says, my home!
[01:32:01.133 --> 01:32:01.973]  So what is his home?
[01:32:01.993 --> 01:32:02.874]  The Democratic Party?
[01:32:02.894 --> 01:32:06.375]  Is the Democratic Party the party of George Soros, Alexander Soros?
[01:32:07.016 --> 01:32:09.797]  Or is the party of the United States of America?
[01:32:10.037 --> 01:32:18.782]  So this is really revealing to the people, once and for all, who is really, who are the puppet masters here, who are pulling the strings.
[01:32:19.102 --> 01:32:23.865]  We got documents earlier this year in January that Alexander Soros was funding.
[01:32:23.885 --> 01:32:25.086]  Anybody can type this in.
[01:32:25.246 --> 01:32:31.531]  Leaked documents show Obama was planning martial law in Maryland in 2015, is the headline.
[01:32:31.871 --> 01:32:34.513]  And it's all their own documents, how they fund Antifa, how they do it.
[01:32:34.893 --> 01:32:39.196]  Antifa is allowed to dox people, threaten to kill people, harass people in restaurants.
[01:32:39.296 --> 01:32:40.236]  Twitter won't take them down.
[01:32:40.737 --> 01:32:44.259]  I confront a CNN reporter who's having me censored, I get banned on Twitter.
[01:32:44.279 --> 01:32:48.122]  So it shows the power of Antifa because Alexander Soros funds it.
[01:32:55.988 --> 01:33:00.130]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:07.393 --> 01:33:16.037]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.058 --> 01:33:21.339]  There must be some way out of here.
[01:33:21.359 --> 01:33:24.601]  Said the Joker to the thief,
[01:33:26.922 --> 01:33:35.847]  Owen was just telling me that a few minutes ago, Senator Kennedy from Louisiana was saying, this is the craziest intergalactic conspiracy I've ever heard of.
[01:33:36.787 --> 01:33:40.289]  It's amazing, Alex, because I think some of these Republicans
[01:33:41.377 --> 01:33:49.944]  You know, it's tough to understand where everyone's coming from with this, but I think some of these Republicans just didn't understand how corrupt the Democrats really were until they are seeing this.
[01:33:50.085 --> 01:33:52.547]  And getting rid of due process is frickin' dangerous.
[01:33:53.307 --> 01:33:54.068]  It's just insane!
[01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:55.309]  Here's what I said.
[01:33:56.470 --> 01:34:01.114]  Some of these people don't believe Christine Blasey Ford.
[01:34:01.515 --> 01:34:03.636]  One party doesn't believe Christine Blasey Ford.
[01:34:03.857 --> 01:34:05.118]  The other party knows she's lying.
[01:34:06.530 --> 01:34:07.991]  And you know what's going on here.
[01:34:08.451 --> 01:34:10.993]  Well, none of her witnesses say anything she said happened.
[01:34:11.033 --> 01:34:18.959]  And now, I'd heard this, but I looked into it, she's the CIA recruiter at the college, and her dad and brothers and grandfathers are all high-level CIA?
[01:34:19.259 --> 01:34:24.063]  She's also got connections with her lawyers to the resist movement, you know, the P-hats.
[01:34:24.563 --> 01:34:26.505]  She's a Hillary minion!
[01:34:27.886 --> 01:34:32.430]  But Cory Booker and Senator Klobuchar said there's no political connection.
[01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:33.010]  I saw that.
[01:34:33.371 --> 01:34:34.612]  He's like, this is ridiculous.
[01:34:34.652 --> 01:34:36.013]  How dare you say this is political?
[01:34:36.714 --> 01:34:38.135]  They just cover up all the real stuff.
[01:34:38.636 --> 01:34:45.362]  But you just had a voice actress get banned from Twitter because she was doing a rendition of Christine Blasey Ford.
[01:34:45.642 --> 01:34:47.364]  So, you know, you're allowed to make up...
[01:34:48.104 --> 01:34:50.346]  Brett Kavanaugh, he's a gang rapist, you know, he's everything.
[01:34:50.386 --> 01:34:54.108]  But if you even think about criticizing Blasey Ford, you're out, bud.
[01:34:54.289 --> 01:34:56.110]  That's what got us banned on the war room.
[01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:57.171]  So we got a suspension.
[01:34:57.371 --> 01:35:00.613]  Well, that's what the whole New York Times was like, do you find her story credible?
[01:35:00.633 --> 01:35:02.274]  We're like, oh God, we didn't mean to even ask that.
[01:35:02.514 --> 01:35:08.418]  You can't even like, imagine court TV and they're like, well, we can't show the prosecutor saying this is incredible because it might hurt someone's feelings.
[01:35:08.739 --> 01:35:10.480]  This is such sick political correctness.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:14.603]  And it's like Oliver Darcy or this lady, you talk about their operatives.
[01:35:16.092 --> 01:35:17.013]  And you get destroyed.
[01:35:17.113 --> 01:35:19.855]  They are protected little snowflakes.
[01:35:20.496 --> 01:35:23.378]  I mean, I tell you, they don't make James Bond the way they used to.
[01:35:23.438 --> 01:35:25.260]  James Bond now is a bug-eyed liar.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.804]  I think that that poll got pulled because the results did not get what they wanted.
[01:35:30.824 --> 01:35:33.486]  Well, it was like the New York Times said, should Alex Jones be banned off more media?
[01:35:33.907 --> 01:35:36.589]  And they had 87% of the New York Times saying no, so they pulled that one.
[01:35:37.622 --> 01:35:38.463]  They're going to keep going.
[01:35:38.503 --> 01:35:39.064]  Here's the thing.
[01:35:39.505 --> 01:35:40.727]  You know, it's like Lindsey Graham said.
[01:35:40.747 --> 01:35:42.810]  They are so desperate for power.
[01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:45.875]  They're so desperate for the seat that they will do anything.
[01:35:45.935 --> 01:35:47.518]  And I think the average American sees that.
[01:35:47.938 --> 01:35:49.200]  Well, they're just a cancer.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.283]  I mean, it's like Venezuela's collapsing.
[01:35:52.308 --> 01:35:53.508]  Everywhere the left gets control.
[01:35:53.808 --> 01:36:01.370]  What logical assumption can you make at this point, Alex, based on the Twilight Zone level of events that we've witnessed in, really, the past two years, but let's just say 48 hours?
[01:36:01.971 --> 01:36:14.394]  The Democrat Party, for them to go along with this... Has a stay-behind network, with all the power of the intelligence agencies, blocking Trump, engaged in mutiny, seven ways to get back at you, they're doing it to me.
[01:36:14.414 --> 01:36:15.814]  People say, well then why don't you back down?
[01:36:15.854 --> 01:36:16.194]  Here's the deal.
[01:36:17.015 --> 01:36:18.015]  To restore the Republic,
[01:36:18.925 --> 01:36:26.170]  To bring back free market, to bring back a system where leftists aren't running things that hate the nuclear family and hate Christians and love radical Islam.
[01:36:26.710 --> 01:36:28.591]  I mean, someone has to get attacked.
[01:36:28.631 --> 01:36:30.212]  So I expected to be attacked.
[01:36:30.913 --> 01:36:32.894]  I didn't expect the M4s to be the tip of the spear.
[01:36:33.474 --> 01:36:35.195]  So I'm sitting right where I want to be.
[01:36:35.236 --> 01:36:37.277]  No matter what happens, it's a testament.
[01:36:37.697 --> 01:36:41.259]  And now Kanye West comes out, and I already knew this was going on behind the scenes.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:46.503]  But, you know, it says Alex Jones and Donald Trump are the Matrix breakers.
[01:36:47.554 --> 01:36:52.255]  And he's saying that in a press conference, and it's quoted in a bunch of newspapers, but then they cut that out of the video.
[01:36:52.575 --> 01:36:59.517]  Because they don't, because he said, everyone knows, oh God, cut out when he says Alex Jones, you're not allowed to say that on the internet.
[01:36:59.638 --> 01:36:59.918]  Wow!
[01:37:00.278 --> 01:37:05.639]  So like in the Soviet Union, you can say words, I mean I guess you can't call the dictator of China...
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.362]  Who's the bear that likes the honey, Winnie the Pooh?
[01:37:10.802 --> 01:37:11.442]  That's banned.
[01:37:11.623 --> 01:37:15.705]  Emojis of Taiwan are banned in China and now other places.
[01:37:16.046 --> 01:37:19.748]  But now even Kanye West cannot say the name Alex Jones.
[01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:24.812]  It's cut out of all the feeds because it is the name you may not say.
[01:37:24.892 --> 01:37:29.735]  It's like saying Sauron or something in Lord of the Rings.
[01:37:29.775 --> 01:37:30.256]  Sauron.
[01:37:30.776 --> 01:37:32.017]  You're a Krogamort.
[01:37:32.217 --> 01:37:32.938]  Voldemort.
[01:37:34.699 --> 01:37:35.259]  Voldemort, no!
[01:37:36.607 --> 01:37:45.753]  So they're about to take a vote here, Alex, and I think Kavanaugh is going to get confirmed, and I think that the Democrats and the left are going to go out and start engaging in domestic violence and terrorism.
[01:37:45.773 --> 01:37:47.314]  And again, this is going out of the committee.
[01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:49.436]  Did you guys tell me they're going to the vote right now?
[01:37:49.896 --> 01:37:51.337]  Oh, there you go.
[01:37:51.357 --> 01:37:52.618]  They will be shortly, but you know.
[01:37:53.817 --> 01:37:57.918]  We've got a great deal going right now on nascent iodine, Alex, that is a matrix breaker.
[01:37:58.258 --> 01:37:59.839]  That's why you're a matrix breaker, Alex.
[01:37:59.899 --> 01:38:03.920]  Well, let me just say that the bad halogens hit your pineal gland.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:09.242]  This is on record to go in there and clean that out, your thyroid, all of it.
[01:38:10.868 --> 01:38:17.037]  And ladies and gentlemen, seriously, there isn't a place you can spend money to fight the globalists in a better place and get great products.
[01:38:17.057 --> 01:38:22.385]  So yes, normally I always go a day or two after sales supposedly over and say this is the last day, this is the last day.
[01:38:22.405 --> 01:38:26.811]  I've been so busy, as everybody knows, up until midnight most nights, that I have not
[01:38:27.859 --> 01:38:28.799]  Done the new specials.
[01:38:28.899 --> 01:38:29.880]  Okay, that's my fault.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:33.501]  And this is the final run of X2, the best halogen, the best iodine out there.
[01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:34.042]  It's amazing.
[01:38:34.442 --> 01:38:35.402]  It is the final run.
[01:38:35.422 --> 01:38:42.245]  So let me go ahead and just actually cut a little commercial here for the weekend so that we can get this out to everybody.
[01:38:43.346 --> 01:38:52.970]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you learn about the pineal gland, if you learn about the thyroid, if you learn about the body and you find out that iodine
[01:38:54.079 --> 01:38:54.299]  Yes.
[01:39:24.439 --> 01:39:27.400]  Why are the Japanese one of the highest IQ's longest-lived people?
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:29.821]  Because they get a lot of iodine from seafood.
[01:39:30.321 --> 01:39:35.362]  They also get a lot of mercury, which kind of counteracts it, so they have some disorders and problems that mercury causes.
[01:39:35.862 --> 01:39:37.343]  This doesn't have mercury in it.
[01:39:37.943 --> 01:39:39.903]  Okay, this is just pure iodine and palm oil.
[01:39:40.223 --> 01:39:42.564]  Nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent pure.
[01:39:44.082 --> 01:39:48.123]  And we get it from oil companies and gas companies that drill between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:39:48.184 --> 01:39:55.806]  We have to go through a DEA distributor because the raw stuff is a controlled substance because it can be used to make all sorts of things for people that have obviously watched Breaking Bad.
[01:39:56.647 --> 01:39:57.847]  What we sell can't do that.
[01:39:58.267 --> 01:40:00.088]  It's patented.
[01:40:00.328 --> 01:40:03.469]  It's injected as gas into the palm oil and denatured.
[01:40:03.569 --> 01:40:07.891]  So instead of being unpalatable to the stomach and throat and body, it's very palatable.
[01:40:08.151 --> 01:40:10.852]  So it's not just the purest iodine out there in this proprietary
[01:40:11.812 --> 01:40:12.973]  Well, finally, a Russian connection.
[01:40:13.013 --> 01:40:15.474]  Patented Russian technique of injecting the gas in.
[01:40:16.494 --> 01:40:19.295]  It then allows you to absorb more of it naturally in your body.
[01:40:19.676 --> 01:40:21.036]  So this is the end of X2.
[01:40:21.476 --> 01:40:24.338]  When you break a contract, you get new suppliers, which we're trying to do.
[01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:31.494]  If it's a new formulation via the FDA rules and all that, you have to sit there and then call it something else.
[01:40:31.554 --> 01:40:34.455]  So we're trying to bring back X, whatever it's going to be.
[01:40:34.716 --> 01:40:35.956]  But this is the final run.
[01:40:35.996 --> 01:40:37.397]  It's going to be a while till we get more.
[01:40:37.757 --> 01:40:39.157]  I'm being optimistic we will get more.
[01:40:39.978 --> 01:40:41.038]  They've already taken PayPal.
[01:40:41.278 --> 01:40:42.699]  They're trying to take our other payment processors.
[01:40:42.719 --> 01:40:44.559]  We have PayPal till like next Wednesday or so.
[01:40:44.919 --> 01:40:50.061]  So you can still go to m4warsstore.com or m4warslife.com and you can still order X2.
[01:40:50.722 --> 01:40:52.102]  You can still get the products.
[01:40:52.182 --> 01:40:53.963]  And seriously, they're so crazy.
[01:40:54.643 --> 01:40:55.344]  39 days out.
[01:40:55.804 --> 01:40:56.985]  They're ramping up so much.
[01:40:57.005 --> 01:40:58.225]  They see us as such enemies.
[01:40:58.706 --> 01:40:59.606]  Who the knows?
[01:40:59.706 --> 01:41:06.410]  So, now is the time to provision us in the fight, if we get our supply lines cut off for a while, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:41:06.551 --> 01:41:11.414]  Get the t-shirts, get the books, get the films, get the materials that have been game changers already.
[01:41:11.734 --> 01:41:12.514]  Be part of history.
[01:41:12.534 --> 01:41:16.136]  A lot of you have already done it, but a ton of you are on the fence.
[01:41:16.237 --> 01:41:17.998]  So, go to InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:41:19.082 --> 01:41:22.704]  InfoWarsLive.com takes you right to the supplements and get some of the Wake Up America coffee.
[01:41:23.064 --> 01:41:24.444]  It's competitively priced.
[01:41:24.464 --> 01:41:27.926]  The same stuff sold under another name at Whole Foods for $7 more a bag.
[01:41:28.226 --> 01:41:32.327]  This is great, organic, Chiapas, high mountain stuff from southern Mexico.
[01:41:32.768 --> 01:41:34.428]  And it's, we drink it here in the office.
[01:41:34.528 --> 01:41:35.429]  It's my favorite coffee.
[01:41:35.449 --> 01:41:36.169]  I think you'll love it.
[01:41:36.369 --> 01:41:37.550]  It's one of our biggest reorder items.
[01:41:38.630 --> 01:41:49.097]  The point is, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, and we've got workarounds of what they're trying to do, but they're actually engaging in things that are mafia tactics now, like you see them doxing senators and stuff.
[01:41:49.757 --> 01:41:51.138]  It's beyond that now, okay?
[01:41:51.478 --> 01:41:52.999]  And I'm not going to even get into what's going on.
[01:41:53.679 --> 01:42:04.446]  Just, we need your prayers, your support, and we need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com and commit now, this weekend, to say, I'm going to dump my PayPal wallet here, and I'm going to stop using the thing.
[01:42:04.506 --> 01:42:05.307]  I'm going to let them know why.
[01:42:06.087 --> 01:42:15.892]  And I'm gonna call Congress and talk about how they're trying to acquire all these other payment processes around the world, and how that deal goes through next month, and how that needs to be stopped under Sherman Antitrust, because it is evil what they're doing.
[01:42:16.432 --> 01:42:22.095]  And other companies engaged in this need to be stopped as well, but support us at InfoWarsTore.com today, or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:23.195]  Oh, and now is such a critical time.
[01:42:26.826 --> 01:42:33.428]  The vote's about to come up, and you've seen how desperate the Democrats are for power, everything they've done just for this one seat.
[01:42:34.289 --> 01:42:35.649]  They see themselves dying.
[01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:40.831]  They see their culture revolution dying, and they know that if they lose this seat, they might as well be dead.
[01:42:40.851 --> 01:42:44.372]  So they're going to get violent if this goes through, and I think it will, Alex.
[01:42:44.652 --> 01:42:45.812]  This is going to get crazy.
[01:42:47.013 --> 01:42:48.373]  All right, Owen Schroer and more.
[01:42:48.413 --> 01:42:50.034]  Your calls and a ton of news straight ahead.

[01:43:07.190 --> 01:43:11.751]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:43:56.219 --> 01:43:56.700]  Go ahead.
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:02.504]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:44:02.725 --> 01:44:03.805]  I'd done The War Room.
[01:44:04.126 --> 01:44:06.568]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:44:06.588 --> 01:44:08.149]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:08.809]  I was exhausted.
[01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:12.412]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[01:44:12.753 --> 01:44:17.396]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[01:44:17.476 --> 01:44:19.778]  Tonight I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:44:19.798 --> 01:44:20.319]  The same thing.
[01:44:20.899 --> 01:44:22.300]  I'm having a full day here at InfoWars.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:23.621]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:44:23.801 --> 01:44:25.642]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:44:25.923 --> 01:44:31.907]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[01:44:32.207 --> 01:44:33.048]  You can sleep with it.
[01:44:33.348 --> 01:44:37.671]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:44:37.711 --> 01:44:40.513]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:44:40.653 --> 01:44:42.374]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:44:42.394 --> 01:44:43.195]  It really works.
[01:44:43.415 --> 01:44:47.998]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found, and I've tried them all.
[01:44:48.378 --> 01:44:50.520]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods, believe me.
[01:44:52.779 --> 01:44:54.741]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:44:55.141 --> 01:45:01.346]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:07.882]  Just a good old boy.
[01:47:07.922 --> 01:47:09.665]  Never meaning no harm.
[01:47:09.725 --> 01:47:11.528]  You know, we were talking during the break.
[01:47:21.548 --> 01:47:22.668]  They're going to make their move.
[01:47:23.088 --> 01:47:25.729]  And here's the article from PJ Media.
[01:47:25.769 --> 01:47:27.109]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:28.209]  It's totally accurate.
[01:47:28.850 --> 01:47:29.910]  Because I see it everywhere.
[01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:31.830]  I experience it.
[01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:38.532]  You had this New York City professor, the one that says, kill the cops, kill the president, kill Pinch.
[01:47:39.112 --> 01:47:41.192]  He's running the group that went in and got in Cruz's face.
[01:47:41.232 --> 01:47:45.833]  And there were death threats in the restaurant that will kill you if you serve them.
[01:47:46.833 --> 01:47:48.394]  And this is real Soviet-style tactics.
[01:47:48.414 --> 01:47:49.394]  They mean bidness.
[01:47:50.294 --> 01:47:52.155]  So, here's the headline.
[01:47:52.195 --> 01:47:57.798]  Communist planning armed insurrection on Twitter, especially of Kavanaugh, is confirmed.
[01:47:57.918 --> 01:47:59.179]  And Twitter lets them.
[01:47:59.719 --> 01:48:03.761]  Just like WorldStarHipHop can, you know, have snuff films on there.
[01:48:04.322 --> 01:48:06.783]  Racial killing attacks, that's okay, but we're banned.
[01:48:07.243 --> 01:48:10.105]  Dr. Bones, the co-host of the Fire Lepus podcast, guillotine.
[01:48:11.252 --> 01:48:14.256]  Started the conversation going with his 5,000 plus Twitter followers.
[01:48:15.137 --> 01:48:17.400]  Hey, quick little question for the military minded lefties.
[01:48:17.801 --> 01:48:29.195]  Should leftist train organize an insurgent focus where they blend in a civilian population for potential attacks on a more malicious structure focused on holding and maintaining turf?
[01:48:30.305 --> 01:48:34.248]  And then it goes into planning the ambushes and assassinations.
[01:48:35.429 --> 01:48:44.356]  Let me just say, I hope not to go down this road, but if they do go down that road, you have all been lazed, my friends.
[01:48:45.257 --> 01:48:49.400]  You have, I mean, you have all, they're so stupid.
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:53.424]  Now, you notice some of the Antifa groups, you don't see them anymore out on the streets.
[01:48:53.764 --> 01:48:54.965]  Some of them have kind of gone away now.
[01:48:55.505 --> 01:48:56.186]  I don't know why.
[01:48:57.747 --> 01:48:58.248]  I don't know why.
[01:48:58.993 --> 01:49:00.774]  Some of the awesome ones have gone away for a while.
[01:49:01.154 --> 01:49:08.978]  But the point is, is that, do they even understand that conservatives and patriots, we don't want violence, but it's our business once it starts?
[01:49:09.739 --> 01:49:23.426]  Well, I think there may be a turning point for some of them that the basic psychology of being on the winning team, and they've been deceived to think that the winning team was hating Trump, and now they're starting to see the light and the real fascism at Google and Apple, etc.
[01:49:24.927 --> 01:49:29.712]  But for those that are going to go the opposite direction, Alex, this is my real concern.
[01:49:30.253 --> 01:49:32.115]  You know, you're already seeing the rhetoric.
[01:49:32.135 --> 01:49:39.103]  I mean, these people really believe that we're about to nominate or confirm a gang rapist to the Supreme Court.
[01:49:39.123 --> 01:49:39.703]  Because they said so!
[01:49:40.484 --> 01:49:44.787]  Just like when they say, you're an effing Nazi, and it's not true, they just believe it.
[01:49:44.827 --> 01:49:45.708]  They just go, Nazi!
[01:49:45.848 --> 01:49:46.268]  Hitler!
[01:49:46.869 --> 01:49:49.851]  That's how they dehumanize you.
[01:49:50.011 --> 01:49:51.932]  I mean, this is like the craziest thing.
[01:49:52.012 --> 01:49:58.717]  In one group of people's reality, I work for Israel, and in another group of people's reality, I'm a Nazi, so it's incredible.
[01:49:59.197 --> 01:50:07.904]  But I just think, Alex, that when you believe that there is a Nazi in the White House, a white supremacist in the White House, and he just nominated a gang rapist,
[01:50:08.424 --> 01:50:10.185]  I mean, do these people really believe that?
[01:50:10.726 --> 01:50:11.806]  They're mentally deranged.
[01:50:12.527 --> 01:50:13.928]  What do you think they're going to do?
[01:50:14.168 --> 01:50:15.329]  They're being primed.
[01:50:15.369 --> 01:50:16.510]  They're being groomed.
[01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:21.753]  They're being instigated by people like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi and Diane Crimeseen.
[01:50:22.354 --> 01:50:28.158]  So, are we really going to be shocked when we see some violence come from this confirmation?
[01:50:28.518 --> 01:50:29.579]  I'm not going to be shocked at all.
[01:50:29.619 --> 01:50:30.519]  In fact, I expect it.
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:31.280]  Exactly.
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:32.601]  Let me give them a little advice.
[01:50:32.661 --> 01:50:33.541]  If they have hidden cells,
[01:50:34.582 --> 01:50:36.844]  You don't dox yourselves and talk about it publicly.
[01:50:37.104 --> 01:50:43.609]  Hidden cells and focus on ambushes and assassinations to bleed right-leaning forces.
[01:50:44.089 --> 01:50:46.772]  And what did I say that got me first banned on Twitter?
[01:50:47.092 --> 01:50:53.076]  I said, the left is doxing conservatives, libertarians, Christians, and AISH, and saying they're going to come kill you at your house.
[01:50:53.937 --> 01:50:56.799]  And they're so mindless that they don't care if you're left-wing or right-wing working for the government.
[01:50:56.819 --> 01:50:57.319]  They're gonna kill you.
[01:50:57.739 --> 01:50:59.440]  I said you should have your battle rifles ready.
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:04.283]  No, I think I'm gonna start walking around with my assault rifle, Alex.
[01:51:05.573 --> 01:51:06.294]  I'm not even kidding.
[01:51:06.354 --> 01:51:10.998]  At a gut level, I finally went ahead and upped security now at the house and everything.
[01:51:11.358 --> 01:51:13.540]  And of course here, we've upped security.
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:14.621]  And that's the thing.
[01:51:14.681 --> 01:51:15.582]  It's just like a tool.
[01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:20.486]  Like I've got a toothbrush in the bathroom and a comb brush and I've got a spatula for flipping hamburgers or pancakes.
[01:51:20.546 --> 01:51:24.069]  And, you know, I've got the instant access pistol safe right there.
[01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:25.830]  Ready to go.
[01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:27.931]  So, that's what it comes down to.
[01:51:27.971 --> 01:51:31.272]  But we have to be ready that that's who these people are.
[01:51:31.312 --> 01:51:35.294]  Now, their normal technique, because they're so cowardly, is just to throw a Molotov cocktail at your front door.
[01:51:35.734 --> 01:51:37.595]  So you've got to have, that's their main training.
[01:51:38.035 --> 01:51:40.236]  So you've got to have your fire extinguishers and stuff ready.
[01:51:40.942 --> 01:51:46.605]  And probably, you know, if you're worried about that, get cameras on your exterior, interior, you know, make sure nothing like this happens.
[01:51:46.625 --> 01:51:49.247]  So it looks like Jeff Flake, who was about to flake out on the vote.
[01:51:49.327 --> 01:51:52.689]  Oh yeah, they were going to have the vote, but they couldn't because Flake was missing, out of David Knight's prediction.
[01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:53.350]  He's back, though.
[01:51:53.650 --> 01:51:54.690]  Okay, okay, he's back.
[01:51:54.710 --> 01:51:55.591]  We're going to go to this here.
[01:51:56.611 --> 01:51:57.492]  Here's Senator Grassley.
[01:51:57.892 --> 01:51:58.513]  Senator Flake.
[01:51:59.313 --> 01:51:59.693]  Oh, thank you.
[01:52:02.188 --> 01:52:04.631]  I have been speaking with a number of people on the other side.
[01:52:04.671 --> 01:52:13.159]  We've had conversations ongoing for a while with regard to making sure that we do due diligence here.
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:17.283]  And I think it would be proper
[01:52:18.152 --> 01:52:22.813]  To delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week.
[01:52:23.054 --> 01:52:23.974]  David predicted it!
[01:52:24.034 --> 01:52:28.375]  In order to let the FBI... From Snowflake, Arizona, Jeff Flake.
[01:52:28.395 --> 01:52:30.136]  To do an investigation limited in time and scope.
[01:52:30.156 --> 01:52:30.636]  He built himself up.
[01:52:30.876 --> 01:52:32.116]  We need due process.
[01:52:32.136 --> 01:52:34.717]  Isn't God great to name this guy Flake?
[01:52:35.037 --> 01:52:35.797]  Let's keep talking.
[01:52:38.258 --> 01:52:44.768]  And I will vote to advance the bill to the floor with that understanding.
[01:52:45.729 --> 01:52:51.617]  And I've spoken to a few other members who are on my side of the aisle.
[01:52:51.657 --> 01:52:53.420]  They're going to pile on with another 50 women.
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:54.921]  But that's my position.
[01:52:55.181 --> 01:53:04.569]  I think that, uh, that we ought to do what we can to make sure that we do all due diligence with a nomination this important.
[01:53:04.649 --> 01:53:12.695]  And I want to say that this committee has acted properly, and the chairman has been over-battered to do investigations from this committee and to delay
[01:53:16.605 --> 01:53:19.988]  This vote in this committee for a week so that Judge... Oh, he wants that?
[01:53:20.048 --> 01:53:20.708]  Oh, that's even worse.
[01:53:20.728 --> 01:53:21.349]  That's a two-week.
[01:53:21.429 --> 01:53:22.169]  ...that Ms.
[01:53:22.269 --> 01:53:26.232]  Ford, Dr. Ford, could be heard, and she was yesterday.
[01:53:27.173 --> 01:53:31.796]  So, so that's, with that agreement, I will vote to advance the bill to the floor.
[01:53:32.016 --> 01:53:32.297]  Okay.
[01:53:33.157 --> 01:53:34.118]  Clerk will call the roll.
[01:53:34.498 --> 01:53:35.899]  Just, wait, just one second.
[01:53:35.939 --> 01:53:37.380]  Can, can Diane speak?
[01:53:37.641 --> 01:53:38.381]  No, Diane.
[01:53:38.581 --> 01:53:39.282]  I'm fine, Diane.
[01:53:39.742 --> 01:53:41.102]  Yeah, what are we voting on?
[01:53:41.142 --> 01:53:41.663]  Let's see.
[01:53:41.903 --> 01:53:43.563]  We are voting on... Literal Chinese spy.
[01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:45.404]  She shouldn't even be allowed to speak at this time.
[01:53:45.424 --> 01:53:46.724]  She has all these Chinese deals.
[01:53:46.744 --> 01:53:48.745]  She put their operative in to run her book.
[01:53:49.385 --> 01:53:51.866]  Part of her deal being an operative is we run your damn office.
[01:53:52.406 --> 01:53:54.527]  She's just worth a hundred million dollars, Chinese spy.
[01:53:54.547 --> 01:53:55.767]  Let's let her run the committee.
[01:53:55.847 --> 01:53:56.487]  It's way more than that.
[01:53:56.507 --> 01:53:58.028]  Dude, she transferred billions to her husband.
[01:53:58.048 --> 01:53:58.848]  Sorry, that's just on record.
[01:54:01.145 --> 01:54:13.157]  That is my understanding, and if the Democrats could speak to it, if Chris or you, as we talked about before, that the Democrats would accept and endorse a... See, there's all these criminals that just want control to loot the country.
[01:54:13.237 --> 01:54:14.298]  No, you're gonna do it free market.
[01:54:14.318 --> 01:54:15.479]  You're gonna damn earn the money.
[01:54:16.199 --> 01:54:22.505]  Just because you're a big blob Feinstein and give two billion to your husband's biotech company doesn't mean you get to be this big fat demon goblin.
[01:54:23.446 --> 01:54:24.847]  Run our lives, you frickin' witch!
[01:54:25.767 --> 01:54:26.527]  Mr. Graham.
[01:54:26.647 --> 01:54:26.787]  Aye.
[01:54:26.907 --> 01:54:28.147]  Mr. Cornyn.
[01:54:28.228 --> 01:54:28.568]  Aye.
[01:54:28.608 --> 01:54:29.148]  Mr. Lee.
[01:54:29.188 --> 01:54:29.288]  Aye.
[01:54:29.308 --> 01:54:29.848]  Mr. Cruz.
[01:54:30.348 --> 01:54:30.928]  Aye.
[01:54:31.168 --> 01:54:31.809]  Mr. Sachs.
[01:54:31.909 --> 01:54:32.289]  Aye.
[01:54:32.589 --> 01:54:33.349]  Mr. Flake.
[01:54:33.929 --> 01:54:34.369]  Aye.
[01:54:34.849 --> 01:54:36.210]  Mr. Grapeau.
[01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.630]  Aye.
[01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:37.230]  Mr. Tillis.
[01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.650]  Aye.
[01:54:37.930 --> 01:54:38.691]  Mr. Kennedy.
[01:54:38.771 --> 01:54:38.871]  Aye.
[01:54:39.171 --> 01:54:40.391]  Mr. Feinstein.
[01:54:40.951 --> 01:54:41.792]  On the nominee.
[01:54:42.072 --> 01:54:42.352]  No.
[01:54:43.352 --> 01:54:44.872]  Mr. Leahy.
[01:54:44.892 --> 01:54:45.033]  Aye.
[01:54:45.073 --> 01:54:46.333]  Feinstein's so senile.
[01:54:48.439 --> 01:54:49.421]  She knows her crimes.
[01:54:50.443 --> 01:54:50.643]  No.
[01:54:52.086 --> 01:54:53.068]  On the nominee, no.
[01:54:54.130 --> 01:54:54.391]  No.
[01:54:54.651 --> 01:54:54.771]  No.
[01:54:58.306 --> 01:54:59.067]  Mr. Hooper?
[01:54:59.267 --> 01:54:59.527]  No.
[01:55:00.288 --> 01:55:00.468]  Ms.
[01:55:00.628 --> 01:55:00.948]  Harris?
[01:55:01.128 --> 01:55:01.348]  No.
[01:55:02.289 --> 01:55:03.030]  Mr. Chairman?
[01:55:03.110 --> 01:55:05.051]  Isn't it an honor standing against this scum?
[01:55:05.071 --> 01:55:07.153]  I mean, it's eye-opening.
[01:55:07.173 --> 01:55:08.854]  The nominee will be reported to the floor.
[01:55:08.894 --> 01:55:10.255]  Mr. Chairman, may I be recognized?
[01:55:10.335 --> 01:55:10.575]  Yes.
[01:55:11.316 --> 01:55:12.176]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:55:12.577 --> 01:55:20.142]  I just want to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Flake, and thank you for giving us the time today to have a conversation.
[01:55:20.162 --> 01:55:22.404]  You've got to bring another 50 women.
[01:55:22.724 --> 01:55:23.364]  Eight hours, yes.
[01:55:23.385 --> 01:55:27.588]  They'll all work for the CIA, but their daddies all work there, but there's no political connection.
[01:55:28.188 --> 01:55:29.591]  There's no political connections.
[01:55:29.791 --> 01:55:31.215]  Hillary Clinton will come forward next.
[01:55:31.235 --> 01:55:32.658]  No, Kavanaugh raped me!
[01:55:32.818 --> 01:55:34.501]  Yeah, he did it!
[01:55:34.542 --> 01:55:35.464]  Maybe Brian Stelter.
[01:55:35.904 --> 01:55:37.087]  Maybe he was at a party.
[01:55:38.214 --> 01:55:40.376]  I love how they use the FBI to like block America's recovery, everything.
[01:55:40.496 --> 01:55:45.539]  The FBI already transferred it forward and said we will not investigate, we have no jurisdiction, it's a state matter, and it's 36 years old!
[01:55:45.559 --> 01:55:46.160]  It's absurd!
[01:56:05.513 --> 01:56:07.435]  Let's bring in Mr. Schrock.
[01:56:07.775 --> 01:56:09.016]  Let's bring in NASA.
[01:56:09.136 --> 01:56:12.718]  NASA, we need you to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's history here.
[01:56:12.738 --> 01:56:13.999]  I would support that motion.
[01:56:14.019 --> 01:56:16.561]  I think we do need this investigation.
[01:56:16.641 --> 01:56:19.383]  In fact, I sort of misunderstood Senator Flake.
[01:56:19.423 --> 01:56:20.984]  We need a proctology exam immediately of him publicly.
[01:56:21.004 --> 01:56:21.825]  I will do it immediately.
[01:56:21.885 --> 01:56:23.366]  For that investigation.
[01:56:28.109 --> 01:56:30.350]  Look at this weird vampire behind her.
[01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:31.651]  Nosferatu's daughter?
[01:56:32.712 --> 01:56:35.073]  I love this committee, but we're not the majority leader.
[01:56:36.073 --> 01:56:42.457]  Senator Flake has made clear what it would take him to be comfortable on a final passage vote.
[01:56:42.937 --> 01:56:44.958]  But it doesn't matter what we say here.
[01:56:44.978 --> 01:56:49.361]  This will be up to Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell.
[01:56:49.741 --> 01:56:50.741]  It is completely up to them.
[01:56:50.761 --> 01:56:53.283]  Yeah, and I think he's made himself very clear.
[01:56:53.403 --> 01:56:54.203]  Let's move.
[01:56:54.243 --> 01:56:54.944]  Senator Leahy.
[01:56:58.419 --> 01:56:58.959]  Senator Lee.
[01:56:59.539 --> 01:57:12.083]  Well, Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure, because this is somewhat unprecedented, when I do agree with the Senator from Arizona that we should have this further investigation.
[01:57:12.583 --> 01:57:17.185]  I love how they pass it, but still say it's not passed.
[01:57:17.265 --> 01:57:18.225]  It's all unprecedented!
[01:57:18.265 --> 01:57:20.366]  It's total CHICOM hijacking!
[01:57:22.028 --> 01:57:34.944]  God help us, just look at this collection of nincompoops who have all gotten rich sucking off of us and they're just afraid that they've been selling America out to the shycoms and that Trump's like pulling it away from them.
[01:57:36.125 --> 01:57:37.307]  I mean, yeah, it's time.
[01:57:37.908 --> 01:57:40.331]  We'll be back in just a few minutes with more of this fiasco.
[01:57:41.889 --> 01:57:48.136]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[01:57:48.176 --> 01:57:59.988]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[01:58:00.168 --> 01:58:06.110]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[01:58:06.150 --> 01:58:19.173]  Last month, the website called Right Wing Watch posted a report highlighting PayPal's continued business relationship with InfoWars, and the Washington Post also noted how business on the InfoWars stores was booming.
[01:58:19.413 --> 01:58:26.095]  PayPal is the latest big tech company to cut ties with far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, stealing a blow to one of founder Alex Jones.
[01:58:26.235 --> 01:58:29.657]  It actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like they're being silenced.
[01:58:47.449 --> 01:58:50.130]  To social media censorship.
[01:58:50.170 --> 01:58:51.030]  That's the new thing.
[01:58:51.450 --> 01:58:55.592]  Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have all booted Jones off their platforms.
[01:58:55.612 --> 01:59:07.036]  PayPal on Thursday night informed InfoWars, which runs an online storefront that sells survival gear and herbal supplements, that it has 10 business days to find a new payment processor.
[01:59:07.056 --> 01:59:10.697]  You can't pick one person and say, well, we don't like what he's been saying.
[01:59:10.757 --> 01:59:11.118]  He's out.
[01:59:11.158 --> 01:59:14.719]  We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in.
[01:59:15.699 --> 01:59:16.820]  And you just can't do that.
[01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:27.748]  Jones hit back on his website saying the InfoWarsStore.com site had no political content, and the move emphasizes how the decision was a broader attack on the InfoWars platform.
[01:59:27.768 --> 01:59:38.476]  A PayPal spokesperson says, quote, we undertook an extensive review of the InfoWars sites and found instances that promoted hate, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, and bullying policies.
[01:59:44.318 --> 01:59:48.450]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:48.972 --> 01:59:50.256]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:06.787 --> 02:00:14.294]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:15.275 --> 02:00:19.178]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:19.638 --> 02:00:23.462]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:23.822 --> 02:00:25.383]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.284 --> 02:00:28.085]  Well, we're taking the deadwood out of the government.
[02:00:28.325 --> 02:00:30.506]  The Republic's already coming back no matter what they do.
[02:00:31.146 --> 02:00:32.886]  Everything they're doing now is going to blow up in their face.
[02:00:32.906 --> 02:00:34.167]  They're not thinking two or three steps ahead.
[02:00:34.747 --> 02:00:39.649]  But if you just tuned in, they just had the Senate committee advance the vote if
[02:00:41.559 --> 02:00:43.740]  There is a week for the FBI to investigate.
[02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:49.281]  But under Senate rules, the Republican and Democrat leader are able to change that anyway.
[02:00:49.361 --> 02:00:52.762]  So this is a train wreck of virtue signaling.
[02:00:52.782 --> 02:00:53.643]  But you had an idea.
[02:00:54.343 --> 02:00:55.423]  And it's an idea in theory.
[02:00:55.443 --> 02:00:56.643]  We're not saying implement the idea.
[02:00:56.663 --> 02:00:58.444]  But it's intriguing.
[02:00:58.464 --> 02:01:07.066]  You were saying, what's the move where you can have, you know, the knight and the castle, the rook switch.
[02:01:08.187 --> 02:01:08.887]  That's castling.
[02:01:10.683 --> 02:01:12.104]  And so you have those pieces switch out.
[02:01:12.885 --> 02:01:15.366]  And so you're saying we should have Trump say, you know what?
[02:01:15.426 --> 02:01:16.347]  This is such a train wreck.
[02:01:16.927 --> 02:01:18.388]  I'm withdrawing Kavanaugh.
[02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:26.514]  And we're going to have an investigation of the CIA and the deep state and everything that's going on with Ford.
[02:01:27.756 --> 02:01:30.778]  We're going to bring forward Barrett, who I think is even better.
[02:01:31.558 --> 02:01:38.042]  But then, like you said, in a few years, when Ginsburg can already not even talk or hardly walk, when she's gone, bring Kavanaugh back vindicated.
[02:01:38.682 --> 02:01:45.366]  So I think, like Castling... Like Julius Caesar sent out to abstentia, sent into exile, comes back triumphant.
[02:01:45.506 --> 02:01:46.027]  Exactly.
[02:01:46.547 --> 02:01:55.953]  So, Trump can have a 360 win here, coined by you, Alex, where he can give the Democrats what they want, and that's this investigation, which is obviously fraudulent, but
[02:01:56.734 --> 02:01:58.442]  He can use the investigation.
[02:01:58.462 --> 02:01:59.668]  But they're gonna want Mueller.
[02:02:01.471 --> 02:02:06.192]  Here's the point though, they can use the investigation, but that is, you know, Rosenstein might be fired in the next 72 hours.
[02:02:06.512 --> 02:02:10.993]  So he can use the investigation and say, okay, we'll give you what you want, we're going to withdraw this for now.
[02:02:11.553 --> 02:02:13.173]  Let's launch a full investigation.
[02:02:13.213 --> 02:02:15.554]  We're going to launch an investigation into Blasey Ford.
[02:02:15.914 --> 02:02:17.274]  Because it's fair, we're going to investigate everybody.
[02:02:17.294 --> 02:02:18.194]  We're going to investigate everybody.
[02:02:18.214 --> 02:02:19.735]  We're going to haul her dad and brother up.
[02:02:19.875 --> 02:02:22.095]  Because somebody's lying, somebody perjured themselves.
[02:02:22.215 --> 02:02:24.035]  I mean, two different accounts.
[02:02:24.115 --> 02:02:26.376]  And they said that nobody was political and Feinstein.
[02:02:27.116 --> 02:02:29.477]  You didn't leak it, so we want your damn phone records.
[02:02:29.517 --> 02:02:44.102]  So yeah, so let's get all the information, let's launch a real investigation into all of this, all sides, and let's have the truth, and then meanwhile let's bring forth Barrett Cohen, and let's nominate her to be on the Supreme Court, and let's have a woman, because you must believe a woman, and whatever she says has to be believed.
[02:02:44.122 --> 02:02:44.762]  But then it'll start.
[02:02:45.905 --> 02:02:48.887]  And so, but this is a way he can, he can avoid the, the domestic trauma.
[02:02:48.907 --> 02:02:52.589]  He tried to give the deep state what they wanted, because this guy's got some neo-content.
[02:02:52.889 --> 02:02:55.831]  He's still pro-gun and against the country, so he's better than what the Democrats would do.
[02:02:56.191 --> 02:02:59.573]  He tried to appease them, and they have crapped all over him.
[02:02:59.913 --> 02:03:01.454]  So bring in the right-wing woman.
[02:03:01.514 --> 02:03:01.874]  Bring her!
[02:03:02.434 --> 02:03:04.055]  And then launch the investigation.
[02:03:04.155 --> 02:03:05.196]  You know what we'll find out.
[02:03:05.776 --> 02:03:06.317]  Once it's...
[02:03:07.426 --> 02:03:09.948]  Revealed who these people really are.
[02:03:10.208 --> 02:03:16.633]  I'll tell you this, I called it, I said three more accusers after the first one, and exactly that happened in the exact order.
[02:03:17.073 --> 02:03:26.320]  And now I've got to put my thinking cap on and look into the ether, but they are undoubtedly going to go completely ape, probably.
[02:03:28.902 --> 02:03:36.888]  They'll act like it's a honeymoon and they're investigating judicially, but then on Tuesday, there'll be an allegation of IRS fraud.
[02:03:40.455 --> 02:03:42.817]  A man will come forward and say that he grabbed his ass.
[02:03:44.538 --> 02:03:49.622]  So they're gonna say he grabbed an intern's butt.
[02:03:49.642 --> 02:03:53.725]  And they're gonna roll the guy and cry, he grabbed my weenie.
[02:03:54.285 --> 02:03:56.427]  And then it'll be, oh yes, oh, and then that'll be it.
[02:03:56.887 --> 02:03:58.328]  So the next thing is, he assaulted a man.
[02:03:58.348 --> 02:03:59.989]  Doesn't matter, it's not believable.
[02:04:00.029 --> 02:04:03.172]  It'll just be, the guy will be like from the CIA.
[02:04:03.212 --> 02:04:04.873]  He'll be work for the CIA.
[02:04:04.893 --> 02:04:06.174]  Never even met Kavanaugh, it won't matter.
[02:04:07.452 --> 02:04:12.175]  And then next they'll say that Barrett was wearing a cat lady suit and like, cut some girls' heads off.
[02:04:13.216 --> 02:04:13.896]  I say do it.
[02:04:14.397 --> 02:04:14.897]  Here's the problem.
[02:04:15.237 --> 02:04:16.538]  I need to be serious next time you come on.
[02:04:17.579 --> 02:04:21.942]  That was a little bit sarcastic tongue in cheek, but actually, just let it be written, just let it be done.
[02:04:21.962 --> 02:04:23.343]  I mean, what do you think they're going to pull?
[02:04:23.363 --> 02:04:24.484]  I think it's going to be really bad.
[02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:33.394]  I mean, I was, like I said, halfway tongue-in-cheek saying, you know, they'll start saying he was like, you know, porking animals in college or something like that, you know.
[02:04:34.375 --> 02:04:34.555]  Ooh!
[02:04:35.195 --> 02:04:37.736]  Maybe we're giving, or is it, are we guessing it, or are we giving ideas?
[02:04:38.437 --> 02:04:38.657]  Maybe.
[02:04:38.677 --> 02:04:44.060]  Oh my God, they'll have like a couple guys who all work for the CIA and all have, you know, go find me accounts with a million bucks in them.
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:45.060]  Oh yeah, oh I have nothing against that.
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:47.221]  I saw him have sex with 14 goats one day.
[02:04:47.942 --> 02:04:51.924]  And then the mean thing was he stabbed the goat in the head with an ice pick and drank his blood.
[02:04:53.151 --> 02:04:54.512]  Well, the moment of truth is here.
[02:04:54.872 --> 02:05:01.976]  George Soros now is taking control of PayPal and these bandits are trying to shut down our final payment processors and end InfoWars.
[02:05:02.356 --> 02:05:03.097]  We've got to reach this point.
[02:05:03.677 --> 02:05:06.939]  And listen, I knew fighting the globalists, there'd be a price to pay.
[02:05:07.199 --> 02:05:10.141]  And I did it because I knew what horrible individuals they were.
[02:05:10.161 --> 02:05:16.285]  And I was willing to sacrifice myself, my name, my treasure, on the altar of having a better future like our forebears did.
[02:05:16.845 --> 02:05:18.766]  But I don't want to go down without a real fight.
[02:05:19.567 --> 02:05:21.648]  Because I'm going to keep swinging until the end.
[02:05:22.816 --> 02:05:34.762]  But if you, the listeners, really awaken and financially support us like never before with the payment systems we have left at InfoWareStore.com, it is going to allow us to really hold the line like the Alamo.
[02:05:35.862 --> 02:05:37.603]  Until we either win or we're defeated.
[02:05:38.183 --> 02:05:49.866]  So in the words of the great founder of Texas, and that wasn't Houston, that was Colonel Travis, victory or death, we are going to win if you take action.
[02:05:50.126 --> 02:05:51.167]  We're going to win if you support us.
[02:05:51.187 --> 02:05:52.447]  But it's now all in your hands.
[02:06:04.164 --> 02:06:09.267]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[02:06:11.068 --> 02:06:20.733]  When I do agree with the Senator from Arizona that we should have this further investigation.
[02:06:22.333 --> 02:06:24.795]  So my understanding is that during the week,
[02:06:26.092 --> 02:06:31.956]  The Democrats are trying to delay the confirmation vote for Kavanaugh right now.
[02:06:31.976 --> 02:06:33.537]  Jeff Flake, the Republican, is behind it.
[02:06:42.183 --> 02:06:44.564]  I can't make that commitment for the leadership.
[02:06:45.144 --> 02:06:49.685]  I can only say that I would be only comfortable moving forward on the floor.
[02:06:50.025 --> 02:06:58.668]  I'll move it out of committee, but I will only be comfortable moving on the floor until the FBI has done more investigation than they have already.
[02:06:59.828 --> 02:07:00.928]  It may not take them a week.
[02:07:02.189 --> 02:07:06.170]  I understand that some of these witnesses may not want to discuss anything further.
[02:07:06.850 --> 02:07:28.665]  But I think we're we owe them due diligence All I have said to Senator Flake is that I would advocate for the position he took But I don't control that senator mr. Chairman yes senator senator Klobuchar mr. Chairman there are other senators as well
[02:07:29.065 --> 02:07:31.366]  You think they just blackmailed Flake behind closed doors?
[02:07:31.386 --> 02:07:33.126]  You think he just got a little blackmailed?
[02:07:58.234 --> 02:08:09.821]  And by the way, if Senator McConnell wants to go forward in light of that, and we still have several senators that haven't said how they're voting on this nominee, I actually think this is very important what just happened right now.
[02:08:10.141 --> 02:08:12.402]  So, it doesn't have to have an agreement.
[02:08:12.522 --> 02:08:14.423]  It is one senator who's standing up.
[02:08:16.823 --> 02:08:22.407]  Mr. Chairman, I just want to express my appreciation to Senator Flake for allowing this process to move forward.
[02:08:22.947 --> 02:08:28.391]  There's some difference of opinion among us as to what exactly the FBI investigation would consist of.
[02:08:29.651 --> 02:08:34.715]  Some of us think it has been concluded and supplemented by this committee's investigation.
[02:08:34.815 --> 02:08:35.935]  Others disagree with that.
[02:08:36.476 --> 02:08:40.478]  But I respect the fact that not only Senator Flake advocated to give Dr. Ford
[02:08:41.719 --> 02:08:52.351]  A chance to appear in front of the committee, which was the right thing to do, but also that he's allowed this process to move forward subject to further discussions about what
[02:08:53.547 --> 02:09:01.855]  The FBI may or may not be able to come up with, but certainly he maintains his right to cast his vote, yea or nay, as he sees fit.
[02:09:02.136 --> 02:09:04.758]  Let's have an FBI investigation into the Tooth Fairy, too.
[02:09:05.139 --> 02:09:07.941]  Maybe FBI investigate the Easter Bunny while we're at it.
[02:09:07.961 --> 02:09:17.091]  Support for a full and fair hearing for Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, as well as his willingness to allow this to go forward subject to his request.
[02:09:17.651 --> 02:09:18.351]  Mr. Chairman?
[02:09:18.692 --> 02:09:19.152]  Mr. Chairman?
[02:09:19.172 --> 02:09:23.534]  Senator Blumenthal, I think I ought to call on Senator Feinstein.
[02:09:24.794 --> 02:09:28.416]  If I, through the chair, could ask a question of Senator Flake.
[02:09:29.036 --> 02:09:34.679]  Does your amendment include continuing the investigation during this period of time?
[02:09:36.062 --> 02:09:38.083]  If I can respond, there is no amendment.
[02:09:38.743 --> 02:09:55.928]  I'm simply stating the discussion that we had between us all is that I would hope, and I think we had some agreement before, that the Democrats who have been, I think, justifiably uncomfortable moving ahead could
[02:09:56.828 --> 02:10:03.432]  Could publicly in an effort to bring this country together Say that we would feel better.
[02:10:03.452 --> 02:10:19.500]  I'm not expecting them to vote yes, but not to complain that an FBI investigation has not occurred and And I that this what I'm trying to do this country's being ripped apart here And and we've got to make sure that we do deal with due diligence.
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:23.782]  I think this committee has done a good job But I do think that we can
[02:10:24.742 --> 02:10:30.369]  Uh, have a short pause and make sure that the FBI can investigate.
[02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:40.241]  My understanding is that some of us would have to, and I'm prepared to do it, make a request to the White House to ask the FBI to do that investigation.
[02:10:40.601 --> 02:10:41.603]  It would be short,
[02:10:42.995 --> 02:10:45.338]  Let's have the Chuck Schumer clip ready to go, guys.
[02:10:45.358 --> 02:10:45.879]  Mr. Chairman?
[02:10:46.079 --> 02:10:47.801]  Because of the two-hour rule, we're adjourned.
[02:11:01.846 --> 02:11:03.730]  Okay guys, now we had that on delay.
[02:11:04.191 --> 02:11:07.338]  Let's see if we catch up live to that, guys, where it's at.
[02:11:07.739 --> 02:11:09.883]  And we may actually be able to go back live to this.
[02:11:10.986 --> 02:11:12.609]  Okay, let's go to Senator Graham right now.
[02:11:13.228 --> 02:11:15.290]  Some Democrats have said OK with that.
[02:11:15.690 --> 02:11:17.312]  Now, I'd like them to come forward.
[02:11:17.352 --> 02:11:21.075]  I'm going to talk to Mitch and Jeff and eventually engage with the White House.
[02:11:21.135 --> 02:11:24.157]  But, you know, again, I don't think we need this.
[02:11:24.318 --> 02:11:26.379]  I am long since ready to vote.
[02:11:26.539 --> 02:11:29.782]  I think he's been very poorly treated, Judge Kavanaugh.
[02:11:29.802 --> 02:11:32.685]  Do you think this is going to sink Judge Kavanaugh's nomination?
[02:11:35.507 --> 02:11:36.527]  Well, absolutely not.
[02:11:36.828 --> 02:11:40.329]  I think Jeff feels good about Judge Kavanaugh.
[02:11:40.349 --> 02:11:42.170]  He just wants to make sure the process is fair.
[02:11:42.370 --> 02:11:43.250]  But you need to ask him.
[02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:47.032]  I've never felt better about him being on the bench than I do right now.
[02:11:47.232 --> 02:11:50.773]  Watch out for Lindsey Graham, folks.
[02:11:50.893 --> 02:11:53.074]  I think he's been woke because of all this.
[02:11:53.294 --> 02:11:54.595]  It's called democracy.
[02:11:54.635 --> 02:11:59.877]  He talked to his colleagues and they're going, Jeff, please, please just give us a few more days.
[02:12:00.397 --> 02:12:01.618]  Jeff's a really good guy.
[02:12:01.698 --> 02:12:02.478]  I wouldn't have done it.
[02:12:03.158 --> 02:12:05.160]  This is a political con job.
[02:12:33.158 --> 02:12:36.801]  I think the people in the country are going to feel differently a week from now.
[02:12:36.841 --> 02:12:37.762]  You could probably put it on both.
[02:12:38.543 --> 02:12:39.744]  However... Oh, you know what?
[02:12:39.764 --> 02:12:42.486]  Because of the political correct nature of our society, that's better.
[02:12:42.526 --> 02:12:45.688]  I feel better about it.
[02:12:45.869 --> 02:12:52.414]  Senator Graham, do you think he was moved after he was confronted by protesters on his way to vote this morning?
[02:12:52.754 --> 02:12:53.655]  No, now listen.
[02:12:54.215 --> 02:12:55.777]  This is Jeff Flake.
[02:12:56.693 --> 02:13:00.338]  I mean, this is what I actually like about the guy, Susan.
[02:13:00.358 --> 02:13:02.400]  I mean, all these people take it really seriously.
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:06.045]  By the way, did you see the images of the protesters today, guys?
[02:13:06.065 --> 02:13:07.707]  You should pull up some of these images on Twitter.
[02:13:07.787 --> 02:13:13.374]  I mean, folks, you know, I'm not going to sit here and insult people, but like, you know, just look at who these people are.
[02:13:15.476 --> 02:13:17.297]  Okay, and reach your own conclusions.
[02:13:17.317 --> 02:13:17.597]  No it wouldn't!
[02:13:17.617 --> 02:13:21.860]  See, and these media, I mean, I don't know these media members, they're probably good people, but they just don't get it!
[02:13:45.074 --> 02:14:11.659]  Or their two PC... Okay, so look... This is what the political correct nature of our media has now done, where... Oh, you know, oh... Christine Blasey Ford is the victim, and we have to believe her, and you know, I feel bad for her, you know, I have no ill will towards her, she has to be believed, and I'm sure that she's not up here... No!
[02:14:13.629 --> 02:14:15.450]  No, a liar is a liar!
[02:14:17.391 --> 02:14:19.892]  A political hitman is a political hitman!
[02:14:20.513 --> 02:14:23.234]  A political hitwoman is a political hitwoman!
[02:14:23.614 --> 02:14:27.737]  A CIA operative against this country is a CIA operative against this country!
[02:14:27.957 --> 02:14:29.678]  It's not a woman that has to be believed!
[02:14:30.578 --> 02:14:33.139]  It's not a victim that we have to listen to!
[02:14:33.159 --> 02:14:35.661]  No, a liar is a liar!
[02:14:37.287 --> 02:14:43.651]  If she lied about all of this, that doesn't make her a victim, that makes her a liar!
[02:14:44.792 --> 02:14:45.733]  And a felon!
[02:14:47.214 --> 02:14:49.756]  Which by my estimation, she is.
[02:14:52.177 --> 02:14:55.820]  But I'll say this one more time as we go to break and then we'll go back to the floor here.
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:05.522]  President Trump needs to pull a castle move on the Democrats, remove Brett Kavanaugh as the nominee, say, we're going to give the Democrats what they want.
[02:15:05.602 --> 02:15:06.862]  We're going to investigate everything.
[02:15:06.962 --> 02:15:08.563]  We're going to investigate Blasey Ford.
[02:15:08.803 --> 02:15:10.463]  We're going to investigate Kavanaugh.
[02:15:10.483 --> 02:15:11.564]  We'll investigate all this.
[02:15:11.584 --> 02:15:12.464]  We'll get to the bottom of it.
[02:15:12.544 --> 02:15:13.764]  And you know what they'll find out.
[02:15:14.424 --> 02:15:15.925]  CIA operation.
[02:15:16.145 --> 02:15:17.665]  The Democrats have been planning this for months.
[02:15:18.725 --> 02:15:19.806]  We already have all the evidence.
[02:15:20.306 --> 02:15:22.326]  We have all the evidence of Blasey Ford's past.
[02:15:22.386 --> 02:15:24.127]  We have all the evidence of the Democrats planning this.
[02:15:24.527 --> 02:15:25.227]  So he pulls...
[02:15:26.207 --> 02:15:30.929]  Kavanaugh, in a Castle move, nominates Barrett Cohen.
[02:15:31.489 --> 02:15:32.049]  She's a woman.
[02:15:32.129 --> 02:15:33.029]  She has to be believed.
[02:15:33.349 --> 02:15:42.092]  So now you make the Democrats go even crazier against a woman, showing America who they really are, and you get an investigation into Blasey Ford to show what was really behind that.
[02:15:42.633 --> 02:15:42.913]  Boom!
[02:15:42.953 --> 02:15:46.934]  You nominate Castle when Bader Ginsburg croaks.
[02:15:47.374 --> 02:15:48.254]  Total victory!
[02:15:48.354 --> 02:15:49.435]  That's total victory!
[02:15:53.738 --> 02:15:55.824]  33% of the population of the U.S.
[02:15:56.064 --> 02:15:58.512]  That's 2 out of every 3 people you're looking at?
[02:15:59.517 --> 02:16:02.959]  carry staph aureus bacteria in their nose.
[02:16:03.679 --> 02:16:09.543]  Two out of every hundred actually carry MRSA, which is a methicillin-resistant staph.
[02:16:10.103 --> 02:16:15.886]  Now what you're talking about is the bacteria that actually kills more people than AIDS.
[02:16:16.326 --> 02:16:24.671]  And so what we do is we work really hard, did massive amounts of research, and we found that our gel, your gel,
[02:16:25.715 --> 02:16:28.016]  As a first line of defense, it's amazing.
[02:16:28.076 --> 02:16:36.438]  If you put that on a wound, it will actually put an invisible cover on that wound that will last up to three days.
[02:16:37.178 --> 02:16:43.739]  And it will kill MRSA and regular staph, E. coli, Candida, Aspergillus niger, in minutes.
[02:16:44.539 --> 02:16:50.601]  So the big deal here is that you can have a kid that gets a scratch on a soccer field
[02:16:51.750 --> 02:17:01.219]  And ends up dead or ends up losing a leg because they got a MRSA, a methicillin-resistant bacteria, from that soccer field.
[02:17:01.899 --> 02:17:09.987]  It's happening in schools, in workout gyms, in the office, on handrails, on telephones, in subways.
[02:17:10.727 --> 02:17:20.953]  And this gel that you have access to is the first line of defense for everybody to be able to just gel up and not have to worry about that bacteria.
[02:17:21.273 --> 02:17:33.320]  You gel it up and you don't worry about it because we have heal rates of about half the normal time and you actually have something now in your house where you can easily take care of it.
[02:17:33.985 --> 02:17:46.629]  I think the key is it's super strong and it lasts a long time because explain why the super silver wound gel dressing from Infowarslife.com that we've probably labeled from your top of the line, your top selling product nationwide, why is it so special?
[02:17:47.089 --> 02:17:55.831]  These studies show that our particle goes into your body, washes down 24 hours with no negative effect on any system in your body.
[02:17:56.271 --> 02:17:58.992]  And many of the others do, many of the others do bioaccumulate.
[02:17:59.798 --> 02:18:00.539]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:18:00.559 --> 02:18:09.427]  The over-the-counter, which is what you have, available to your people, is so strong that it has direct claims on killing MRSA.
[02:18:09.707 --> 02:18:12.470]  You have one of the only products in the U.S.
[02:18:12.510 --> 02:18:16.554]  that can, like, make a direct claim on mitigation of a sunburn.
[02:18:16.954 --> 02:18:22.820]  You can put it on a bug bite and it'll stop the itch in about, probably, three or four minutes.
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:26.303]  You can put it on any type of burn.
[02:18:26.423 --> 02:18:30.367]  What a blessing to have something that you have in your house right now.
[02:18:30.547 --> 02:18:32.829]  You don't have to go to the doctor to get this.
[02:18:33.029 --> 02:18:45.581]  So hospitals last year had 94,000 life-threatening infections that were caused in the hospitals and they had no antibiotics that would work against them.
[02:18:46.301 --> 02:18:51.765]  That's why they're going back to the silver products, because our silver is proven to kill those.
[02:18:52.306 --> 02:18:58.670]  I mean, the two most heinous bugs are Methicillin-resistant Staph, and one called VRE.
[02:18:58.810 --> 02:19:03.413]  And VRE is Ventomycin-resistant Enterococcus Fecalis.
[02:19:03.614 --> 02:19:06.015]  Nobody wants to say it, but it will kill you.
[02:19:06.616 --> 02:19:09.518]  And so the cool part is, this gel kills it in minutes.
[02:19:10.218 --> 02:19:19.669]  So you don't have to worry about your kid getting an amputation or wound or you don't have to have, you know, a funeral for somebody you lost.
[02:19:19.689 --> 02:19:24.834]  And the bottom line is you guys did years and years and years and years and years and years and years of dozens of peer-reviewed studies.
[02:19:25.134 --> 02:19:31.682]  You finally found out the perfect silver, the most effective, and it's available at Infowarsstore.com and you helped save the country.
[02:19:32.142 --> 02:19:33.522]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:21.138 --> 02:20:26.201]  What a time to be experiencing life on Earth.
[02:20:28.082 --> 02:20:29.263]  In the Milky Way galaxy.
[02:20:30.043 --> 02:20:30.684]  In the universe.
[02:20:30.944 --> 02:20:31.444]  In space.
[02:20:33.425 --> 02:20:34.886]  Here we are, ants marching.
[02:20:36.387 --> 02:20:37.948]  All to the beat of a different drum.
[02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:41.110]  There is no reality.
[02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:42.731]  There is no truth.
[02:20:44.752 --> 02:20:46.513]  There's just existence and life.
[02:20:49.154 --> 02:20:49.995]  One side of the aisle.
[02:20:50.982 --> 02:20:55.906]  sees one thing and the other side of the aisle sees something entirely different.
[02:21:00.209 --> 02:21:02.370]  How do you explain that?
[02:21:02.451 --> 02:21:13.018]  Well, I think we know, but we won't get into it because President Trump is responding to media right now when it comes to the chaos and the circus that has become to the Kavanaugh hearing.
[02:21:13.038 --> 02:21:14.319]  So let's go live to President Trump.
[02:21:18.334 --> 02:21:21.456]  Really something that I haven't seen before.
[02:21:21.476 --> 02:21:22.636]  It was incredible.
[02:21:22.956 --> 02:21:27.138]  It was an incredible moment, I think, in the history of our country.
[02:21:28.379 --> 02:21:31.500]  But certainly she was a very credible witness.
[02:21:32.141 --> 02:21:35.422]  She was very good in many respects.
[02:21:35.802 --> 02:21:36.543]  And I think that
[02:21:38.898 --> 02:21:47.321]  I don't know if this is going to continue onward, or are we going to get a vote, but again, I'm here, so I'm not out there watching, because I can't be.
[02:21:47.941 --> 02:21:51.182]  And of great respect, although maybe we'll go watch together, okay?
[02:21:51.222 --> 02:21:52.062]  We'll watch together.
[02:21:52.963 --> 02:21:56.444]  But I think it will work out very well for the country.
[02:21:56.504 --> 02:21:58.465]  I just want it to work out well for the country.
[02:21:58.665 --> 02:22:00.465]  If that happens, I'm happy.
[02:22:00.645 --> 02:22:03.066]  Have you thought at all about a replacement for Judge Kavanaugh?
[02:22:03.626 --> 02:22:04.386]  Not even a little bit.
[02:22:05.027 --> 02:22:05.707]  Not even a little bit.
[02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:10.810]  I have no message.
[02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:12.532]  I mean, they have to do what they think is right.
[02:22:12.752 --> 02:22:14.253]  There's no message whatsoever.
[02:22:14.293 --> 02:22:16.775]  They have to do what they think is right.
[02:22:16.815 --> 02:22:18.876]  They have to be comfortable with themselves.
[02:22:19.096 --> 02:22:20.697]  And I'm sure that's what they are.
[02:22:21.538 --> 02:22:23.119]  I'm going to rely on
[02:22:27.566 --> 02:22:39.812]  All of the people, including Senator Grassley, who's doing a very good job, that'll be a decision that they're going to make, and they suspect they'll be making some decisions soon, whether to take a vote or not.
[02:22:39.832 --> 02:22:40.873]  Whatever else they want to do.
[02:22:40.953 --> 02:22:45.115]  I will be totally reliant on what Senator Grassley and the group decides to do.
[02:22:47.662 --> 02:22:50.443]  We're going to talk about Venezuela.
[02:22:50.483 --> 02:22:51.764]  I was waiting for that question.
[02:22:51.784 --> 02:22:53.904]  I think Maduro is in New York today.
[02:22:53.924 --> 02:22:56.645]  The president of Venezuela is in New York today, I believe.
[02:22:56.685 --> 02:22:57.745]  Can you guys double check that?
[02:22:57.785 --> 02:22:58.866]  I believe that's today, though.
[02:22:59.406 --> 02:23:01.167]  Chile is really something special.
[02:23:01.247 --> 02:23:07.328]  If you look at what they've done, how far they've come, you look at how well run the country is.
[02:23:07.388 --> 02:23:09.649]  So I want to say it's an honor to be with you.
[02:23:09.829 --> 02:23:10.389]  A great honor.
[02:23:10.409 --> 02:23:13.090]  Thank you very much.
[02:23:13.170 --> 02:23:14.851]  Is he with the president of Chile right now?
[02:23:14.911 --> 02:23:15.551]  Is that what's going on?
[02:23:18.975 --> 02:23:20.421]  I think that's what he was just saying there.
[02:23:26.096 --> 02:23:27.737]  We'll see what happens.
[02:23:27.937 --> 02:23:29.198]  I know he wants to meet with us.
[02:23:29.238 --> 02:23:30.119]  We'll see what happens.
[02:23:30.519 --> 02:23:34.902]  Venezuela is a mess and it's got to be cleaned up and people have to be taken care of.
[02:23:35.402 --> 02:23:36.163]  Thank you very much.
[02:23:38.604 --> 02:23:41.606]  Okay, so Maduro is in New York.
[02:23:42.687 --> 02:23:48.331]  Whether or not President Trump will be meeting with Maduro is a question right now.
[02:23:51.616 --> 02:23:55.339]  President Trump is trying to get the reporters out of his office right now.
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:23:59.182]  I believe so we can speak with the Chilean president.
[02:23:59.202 --> 02:24:00.603]  I think that's who he's meeting with right now.
[02:24:00.663 --> 02:24:14.794]  But, you know, there was, after President Trump, maybe it's in here, the stack of news, after President Trump called out Venezuela,
[02:24:17.273 --> 02:24:21.715]  During his UN speech, you had Canada... Guys, try to find the story.
[02:24:21.735 --> 02:24:23.055]  I'm sorry, I'm throwing all this on you.
[02:24:23.095 --> 02:24:38.782]  You had Canada, Colombia... You had, I believe it was, Canada and five countries in South America, Central America, come out and say it's time for military tribunals against the Venezuela government.
[02:24:38.842 --> 02:24:41.903]  It's time for a UN, I think, investigation.
[02:24:42.643 --> 02:24:44.844]  I'm sorry, I don't have the story in front of me.
[02:24:46.305 --> 02:24:46.565]  So...
[02:24:48.015 --> 02:24:50.337]  You have Trump mention a potential military coup.
[02:24:50.637 --> 02:24:54.980]  Of course, who got real hot under the collar after that was Nikki Haley.
[02:24:55.881 --> 02:25:03.407]  Anytime the military gets brought up or any sort of intervention, Nikki Haley, well, let's just say she's like a teenage girl.
[02:25:05.649 --> 02:25:06.950]  Trump officials press U.N.
[02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:08.511]  to sanction Venezuela as U.S.
[02:25:08.551 --> 02:25:09.472]  and Europe have done.
[02:25:09.792 --> 02:25:10.072]  U.N.
[02:25:10.172 --> 02:25:10.473]  box.
[02:25:11.954 --> 02:25:13.315]  There was something signed though, guys.
[02:25:13.615 --> 02:25:14.696]  I have the story on my desk.
[02:25:14.716 --> 02:25:15.757]  I can go grab it in the break.
[02:25:15.857 --> 02:25:24.984]  But it was Canada and four or five Latin American, South American countries that are saying, yeah, something has to be done about the leadership in Venezuela.
[02:25:25.024 --> 02:25:25.705]  It's out of control.
[02:25:25.985 --> 02:25:31.169]  Where they go out and you have, you can't get toilet paper.
[02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:37.074]  People are eating like raw animals on the streets, like tipping over cars.
[02:25:37.134 --> 02:25:38.375]  I mean, it's total chaos.
[02:25:39.875 --> 02:25:46.621]  And then President Maduro, you know, goes for like fancy five-course dinners and posts it on social media.
[02:25:47.182 --> 02:25:50.404]  And I'm supposed to sit here and have the Democrats lecture me about socialism?
[02:25:51.365 --> 02:25:52.566]  Caring about the little guy?
[02:25:52.586 --> 02:25:54.048]  That's insulting.
[02:25:54.908 --> 02:25:56.230]  That's unbelievable is what it is.
[02:25:56.350 --> 02:26:00.113]  But these people don't even exist in reality, so what difference does it even make?
[02:26:03.829 --> 02:26:12.915]  We're going to go back to the floor here, if they go back to whatever they're discussing right now, whether or not they're going to delay this nomination, whether or not they're going to take a vote.
[02:26:12.955 --> 02:26:14.096]  They were supposed to take a vote.
[02:26:14.136 --> 02:26:19.340]  The vote got delayed by Flake, who wants to move forward with this, who wants to have an FBI investigation now.
[02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:21.041]  Oh, the Democrats aren't comfortable.
[02:26:21.481 --> 02:26:22.322]  What are we going to do?
[02:26:25.164 --> 02:26:30.608]  So, we'll see what happens, but we'll have the live coverage for you right here on the Alex Jones Show, whatever comes.
[02:26:33.624 --> 02:26:39.306]  Will Trump meet with Maduro in New York?
[02:26:39.627 --> 02:26:43.668]  As Maduro is in New York, I believe he's at the UN General Assembly.
[02:26:45.589 --> 02:27:02.576]  This is just days after President Trump says it might be time for a military coup in Venezuela, where what should be a very rich, prosperous nation with the oil and everything they have down there, great people, but the socialist government steals all the wealth.
[02:27:05.782 --> 02:27:10.905]  And you know, Venezuelan people are very proud people, as many South American countries are.
[02:27:11.825 --> 02:27:22.991]  And... I'd love to see... I'd love to see Venezuela become a new example worldwide.
[02:27:25.430 --> 02:27:35.521]  Not in a negative light, you know, to say, look at how bad it is, but to say, look at what happened under socialism and now look what we're going to do under a free market capitalist democracy.
[02:27:37.643 --> 02:27:46.733]  Just like if you want to look at South Korea versus North Korea, not saying, you know, South Korea is perfect, I'm just saying, it'd be nice to sit here and say,
[02:27:48.444 --> 02:28:13.204]  Twenty years down the road, after the socialist government is kicked out, and you have democratic elections, you have a free market system, and they start doing fair trade with the other countries in South America, like Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and then to see wealth and prosperity return to Venezuela, to see the wealth that they have in that oil-rich country return to the people, would be a beautiful thing for humanity.
[02:28:14.324 --> 02:28:18.468]  And another case study against the perils of socialism.
[02:28:20.130 --> 02:28:21.632]  So it'll be interesting to see.
[02:28:21.652 --> 02:28:30.361]  I would imagine that Maduro would want to meet with President Trump, considering what President Trump has put on the table.
[02:28:31.322 --> 02:28:35.606]  But we'll see if President Trump has any interest in doing that.
[02:28:35.706 --> 02:28:35.966]  Alright.
[02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:37.540]  We're going to a break.
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:41.142]  We're going to go back to the floor of Congress if they go back live.
[02:28:41.222 --> 02:28:44.323]  Otherwise, I may open up the phone lines to see, what do you think about this madness?
[02:28:44.663 --> 02:28:45.584]  What do you think Trump should do?
[02:28:45.604 --> 02:28:47.104]  What do you think about Jeff Flake?
[02:28:47.645 --> 02:28:50.426]  And what happens in America on the other side of this?
[02:28:50.466 --> 02:28:50.926]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.211 --> 02:28:56.372]  Alex in Michigan.
[02:28:56.392 --> 02:28:56.952]  You're on the air.
[02:28:57.032 --> 02:28:57.393]  Go ahead.
[02:28:57.573 --> 02:28:58.313]  Alex Jones.
[02:28:58.533 --> 02:28:59.794]  Good to talk to you again, sir.
[02:28:59.934 --> 02:29:00.895]  We are Alex Jones.
[02:29:01.035 --> 02:29:02.216]  We are Julian Assange.
[02:29:02.496 --> 02:29:08.120]  Thanks for exposing the Skynet program launching in China where the, you know, the robots are taking over.
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:09.901]  Julian Assange is talking about it now.
[02:29:10.001 --> 02:29:10.902]  We are the resistance.
[02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:12.183]  I use the products.
[02:29:12.303 --> 02:29:14.264]  Everyone should go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:14.304 --> 02:29:15.525]  Get the Survival Shield X2.
[02:29:15.585 --> 02:29:16.766]  I've been using that like
[02:29:16.906 --> 02:29:18.927]  No brother, you're doing a great job!
[02:29:35.937 --> 02:29:37.238]  I know.
[02:29:37.618 --> 02:29:52.688]  It's like, why can't they just, you know, let us be and have us run our own lives?
[02:29:52.708 --> 02:29:54.850]  You know, people talk about, you know, states' rights.
[02:29:55.190 --> 02:30:01.734]  I think, you know, individual rights is what it comes down to, you know, and medical freedom and the right to choose what's in our own bodies.
[02:30:01.834 --> 02:30:05.657]  And I choose to have the Infowars products in my body because I'm trying to fight these
[02:30:05.717 --> 02:30:11.178]  Well, I can tell you, X2, unfortunately it's our last run of it, and the special has to end this weekend at 25% off.
[02:30:11.298 --> 02:30:16.200]  It's amazing, and again, just having good iodine in your body versus the bad allergens is night and day.
[02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:17.000]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:17.880]  I appreciate your call.
[02:30:25.545 --> 02:30:26.565]  He's The Amazing Lucas.
[02:30:26.765 --> 02:30:29.486]  Every one of his videos is really good, really informative.
[02:30:30.106 --> 02:30:33.567]  And he's a champion bodybuilder and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[02:30:34.147 --> 02:30:39.028]  And he's The Amazing Lucas on Instagram, at I'm The Amazing Lucas, YouTube The Amazing Lucas.
[02:30:39.148 --> 02:30:43.788]  And he just got involved in the last year or so because of all the stuff that he has seen.
[02:30:43.948 --> 02:30:44.969]  So it's great to have you here with us.
[02:30:45.129 --> 02:30:45.989]  Thank you for having me.
[02:30:46.629 --> 02:30:51.710]  Man, I tell you, what would you call the state of the nation right now?
[02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:53.451]  What would you call that?
[02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:56.673]  A hysterical, and it's manufactured hysteria.
[02:30:57.093 --> 02:30:58.054]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:30:58.735 --> 02:31:01.417]  Because everything from Maxine Waters, like, that's real.
[02:31:01.437 --> 02:31:05.380]  When it comes to the mom, the thing is, many people were focusing on what she was saying.
[02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:10.484]  But if you really go back in time, they've always been saying some off-the-wall things.
[02:31:10.584 --> 02:31:12.585]  The only difference is, now people are cheering.
[02:31:12.786 --> 02:31:17.790]  And once you have Tommy Loring and water thrown in her face, it's only a matter of time that water becomes acid.
[02:31:18.370 --> 02:31:19.171]  When do they stop her?
[02:31:19.211 --> 02:31:19.992]  How far does this go?
[02:31:20.292 --> 02:31:20.873]  They won't stop.
[02:31:21.213 --> 02:31:22.014]  They absolutely won't stop.
[02:31:22.034 --> 02:31:26.339]  Because what they won't allow to happen is a review of what happened in 2016.
[02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:28.561]  And I don't think a lot of people understand that.
[02:31:28.622 --> 02:31:31.725]  What we're seeing is just, it's the tipping point.
[02:31:32.226 --> 02:31:37.231]  And while they're figuring out and re-strategizing right now, this is a time that we need to consolidate.
[02:31:38.112 --> 02:31:38.592]  Absolutely.
[02:31:57.947 --> 02:32:00.068]  To steal the American dream, it's so cold-blooded.
[02:32:00.128 --> 02:32:00.969]  It absolutely is.
[02:32:01.029 --> 02:32:03.771]  The thing is, what the left touches, they destroy.
[02:32:03.831 --> 02:32:15.058]  And for people who don't believe that, you can look at the black community, everything from separating fathers with the welfare, to putting Planned Parenthoods in the communities, to presently right now, seeing voter IDs, it's racist, it's racist.
[02:32:15.138 --> 02:32:16.859]  It's like, we all know that's not the case.
[02:32:17.059 --> 02:32:18.320]  You want the votes from the legals.
[02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:24.184]  But what the frightening part is, what should be alarming to people right now, is that they have their eyes on America.
[02:32:24.504 --> 02:32:25.545]  That should be the frightening part.
[02:32:25.845 --> 02:32:26.225]  Guess what?
[02:32:26.285 --> 02:32:29.048]  That affects you, that affects me, that affects everyone.
[02:32:29.288 --> 02:32:31.490]  And that's why you need to pick up and fight.
[02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:33.672]  And I'm not saying incite the violence, but you need to fight.
[02:32:34.052 --> 02:32:37.295]  And, you know, no pun intended, but it is an information war.
[02:32:37.475 --> 02:32:38.216]  And it's true!
[02:32:38.296 --> 02:32:41.598]  I mean, what you said is everything they touch turns to crap.
[02:32:41.719 --> 02:32:44.721]  Why in the world would we want these people running things?
[02:32:44.741 --> 02:32:48.865]  TheAmazingLucas, at I am TheAmazingLucas on Twitter, be sure and follow him.
[02:32:55.794 --> 02:32:58.423]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.244 --> 02:33:20.387]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:21.127 --> 02:33:22.628]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.228 --> 02:33:25.950]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:35.456]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:35.496 --> 02:33:37.377]  Owen Troyer filling in here for the remainder.
[02:33:37.397 --> 02:33:41.339]  We are going to open up the phone lines to take your calls.
[02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:44.121]  I want to hear from the callers today specifically.
[02:33:44.281 --> 02:33:45.422]  What do you think about
[02:33:46.311 --> 02:33:47.272]  The Kavanaugh hearings.
[02:33:48.432 --> 02:33:50.013]  What do you think President Trump should do?
[02:33:51.354 --> 02:33:55.937]  What do you think comes next if they do the investigation?
[02:33:56.358 --> 02:33:59.099]  Just in general, what do you see coming from these hearings?
[02:33:59.179 --> 02:34:00.140]  What do you think about it?
[02:34:00.700 --> 02:34:02.061]  We want to hear from the audience today.
[02:34:02.121 --> 02:34:03.262]  What should President Trump do?
[02:34:03.322 --> 02:34:06.604]  What should the Republicans do about the Kavanaugh hearings?
[02:34:07.185 --> 02:34:09.266]  Which, it looks to me like they will be delaying this.
[02:34:09.326 --> 02:34:10.867]  If they go back live, we'll go back live.
[02:34:10.887 --> 02:34:12.008]  But I found this story, so...
[02:34:13.237 --> 02:34:16.278]  President Trump is trying to help the North Korean people.
[02:34:16.318 --> 02:34:18.159]  He's also trying to help the Venezuelan people.
[02:34:18.379 --> 02:34:19.840]  The New York Times published the story.
[02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:24.502]  Neighbors refer to Venezuela to criminal court in historic rebuke.
[02:34:24.542 --> 02:34:28.864]  So it's Canada and then Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru.
[02:34:30.084 --> 02:34:33.106]  And this is right after President Trump mentions
[02:34:34.329 --> 02:34:38.690]  The drastic situation in Venezuela during his UN speech.
[02:34:38.830 --> 02:34:41.710]  So, that just shows you the Trump effect right there.
[02:34:41.770 --> 02:34:43.951]  Maduro is in New York today.
[02:34:44.251 --> 02:34:46.491]  May there be a meeting?
[02:34:46.951 --> 02:34:47.932]  We will find out.
[02:34:48.912 --> 02:34:55.133]  By the way, Facebook says 50 million user accounts hit by security breach.
[02:34:56.033 --> 02:34:58.974]  Obama warns against racial, nationalistic politics.
[02:34:59.174 --> 02:34:59.754]  Are you kidding me?
[02:35:02.577 --> 02:35:17.280]  I almost want to do a segment where we just go and look at all the pictures of the protesters during the Kavanaugh hearings because, folks, I mean, these people, I'm sorry, but, you know, they say don't judge a book by its cover, but I think you can read these books by the cover.
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:25.462]  There's a picture that Alyssa Milano tweeted out, too, of Feinstein and Murkowski that I think is very telling.
[02:35:27.139 --> 02:35:31.122]  And it's basically Feinstein domineering over Murkowski.
[02:35:31.582 --> 02:35:32.082]  Murkowski?
[02:35:32.142 --> 02:35:33.083]  I think it's Murkowski.
[02:35:33.983 --> 02:35:40.287]  And you can see Murkowski kinda like, you know, wants to listen, feels bad, they're obviously talking, and Feinstein's like, Listen to me.
[02:35:41.548 --> 02:35:42.669]  I'm the Overlord.
[02:35:43.329 --> 02:35:44.870]  Someday you'll have your power.
[02:35:45.711 --> 02:35:46.831]  But now is mine.
[02:35:48.212 --> 02:35:49.593]  Give me your force.
[02:35:50.614 --> 02:35:52.675]  Give your power to the dark side.
[02:35:54.787 --> 02:35:57.909]  Lisa Murkowski's like, oh, but I just, I just feel it's wrong.
[02:35:57.949 --> 02:35:59.350]  I don't want to betray the Republicans.
[02:35:59.370 --> 02:36:00.931]  I don't think this man's being treated fairly.
[02:36:01.331 --> 02:36:02.992]  Didn't you see what I said?
[02:36:03.012 --> 02:36:04.653]  He's a gang rapist.
[02:36:05.433 --> 02:36:06.854]  This man is a gang rapist.
[02:36:06.874 --> 02:36:07.794]  He must be stopped.
[02:36:08.135 --> 02:36:09.736]  He cannot be on the Supreme Court.
[02:36:10.796 --> 02:36:12.457]  We the women have to take control.
[02:36:12.477 --> 02:36:14.098]  The men are out of control.
[02:36:14.118 --> 02:36:15.319]  Didn't you hear Cory Booker?
[02:36:15.759 --> 02:36:17.140]  The patriarchy must end.
[02:36:19.478 --> 02:36:26.960]  I am Dianne Feinstein, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, making deals for my husband's company worth billions.
[02:36:27.561 --> 02:36:32.862]  Don't you understand if I don't get the next Supreme Court justice, I could be in jail?
[02:36:33.602 --> 02:36:39.684]  Don't you know if we don't get a Democrat in the office, then I could be in jail?
[02:36:41.165 --> 02:36:44.486]  If anybody waged an investigation into me, I'd be in jail immediately.
[02:36:44.746 --> 02:36:47.667]  Chinese spy, illegal deals, billions of dollars.
[02:36:48.686 --> 02:36:50.047]  We have to stop Kavanaugh!
[02:36:50.967 --> 02:36:52.708]  Give me your power, Lisa.
[02:36:53.548 --> 02:36:54.649]  Give me your will.
[02:36:55.269 --> 02:36:56.909]  And I will reward you.
[02:36:58.670 --> 02:37:00.531]  Seriously, look at that picture.
[02:37:02.692 --> 02:37:07.674]  If that isn't Dianne Feinstein crime scene in a nutshell, I don't know what is.
[02:37:07.694 --> 02:37:08.034]  So, 1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:37:08.054 --> 02:37:08.955]  1-877-789-2539.
[02:37:08.995 --> 02:37:09.935]  We'll take your calls here.
[02:37:09.955 --> 02:37:12.736]  What do you think about the Kavanaugh hearings?
[02:37:18.877 --> 02:37:22.779]  What should Trump do, and what do the Democrats do next?
[02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:31.565]  Now, I suspect if Kavanaugh gets confirmed, which now I don't think is going to happen.
[02:37:31.745 --> 02:37:40.670]  I said it was a 50-50 chance yesterday, and now I don't think it's going to happen.
[02:37:41.231 --> 02:37:42.011]  And they're done.
[02:37:42.251 --> 02:37:44.092]  The crew is now telling me that they're done for the day.
[02:37:44.412 --> 02:37:46.394]  So they're adjourned, there's not going to be a vote today.
[02:37:47.332 --> 02:37:52.855]  Okay, so they're not going to vote today because Senator Jeff Flake wants to delay for a FBI investigation.
[02:37:52.895 --> 02:37:54.256]  So congratulations!
[02:37:59.038 --> 02:38:00.899]  I'm just getting information from the crew right now.
[02:38:00.939 --> 02:38:01.199]  Go ahead.
[02:38:03.821 --> 02:38:04.801]  So the hearing's done.
[02:38:10.484 --> 02:38:12.185]  Okay, but they're not going to vote.
[02:38:12.425 --> 02:38:13.546]  They're not going to vote to confirm.
[02:38:21.943 --> 02:38:23.524]  So are they gonna vote today then?
[02:38:23.924 --> 02:38:31.148]  Or is that... So the confirmation vote on the Senate floor is next week.
[02:38:31.188 --> 02:38:32.809]  Let's see if we can get a date and time on that.
[02:38:33.209 --> 02:38:34.090]  So they're done for today.
[02:38:35.310 --> 02:38:39.372]  But you know, I think we should be congratulating the Democrats.
[02:38:40.253 --> 02:38:45.976]  You have successfully pulled off a heist of the Supreme Court justice nomination process.
[02:38:47.437 --> 02:38:51.139]  You have successfully pulled off a heist of truth.
[02:38:52.734 --> 02:38:53.835]  and justice in this country.
[02:38:53.855 --> 02:38:59.778]  You have successfully pulled off a heist of reality and you've successfully pulled off a heist.
[02:39:00.399 --> 02:39:01.459]  You want to know the real crime?
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:12.806]  The Democrats have successfully pulled off a heist of the true pain and suffering that real victims of sexual assault go through.
[02:39:13.587 --> 02:39:15.208]  That's what the Democrats have done today.
[02:39:17.209 --> 02:39:18.190]  The negative energy
[02:39:21.206 --> 02:39:25.349]  That naturally brings forth human emotion in the form of sympathy.
[02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:35.538]  The Democrats have now heisted that to steal and stop a Supreme Court justice.
[02:39:37.159 --> 02:39:39.181]  So I think we should be congratulating the Democrats today.
[02:39:39.201 --> 02:39:41.363]  You have successfully pulled off a lie.
[02:39:42.349 --> 02:39:48.611]  You have successfully pulled off a coup against the American media, against the American justice system, and against the American people.
[02:39:49.091 --> 02:39:50.372]  So good on you, Democrats!
[02:39:51.272 --> 02:39:57.934]  A domestic terror organization, ladies and gentlemen, the Democrat Party of the United States of America, and you better believe it!
[02:39:59.735 --> 02:40:02.117]  Which I don't think is going to happen now, but you better believe it.
[02:40:02.557 --> 02:40:09.242]  If Neil Gorsuch is confirmed next week, the Democrats will go hot in their domestic terror.
[02:40:09.782 --> 02:40:14.345]  And you won't just see people in Trump hats getting punched and getting things thrown at them.
[02:40:14.866 --> 02:40:16.427]  You won't just see stuff like that.
[02:40:16.867 --> 02:40:23.692]  They will be stalking and even getting physically violent with senators and congressmen and members of the media.
[02:40:24.673 --> 02:40:25.133]  They will.
[02:40:25.374 --> 02:40:26.634]  They are fully unhinged.
[02:40:26.955 --> 02:40:36.922]  They believe there is a white supremacist, KKK, Nazi as the president, and they think he just nominated a gang rapist to the Supreme Court.
[02:40:37.683 --> 02:40:38.643]  They really believe that?
[02:40:40.225 --> 02:40:44.668]  They're fully unhinged, they have nothing to live for, so this is their battle now.
[02:40:44.848 --> 02:40:53.715]  A total, fake, fictional version of reality that they latch onto in their head because they have nothing else.
[02:40:54.764 --> 02:41:00.507]  And they feel a connection to one another for the first time in their hatred.
[02:41:01.887 --> 02:41:03.448]  So they come together in hatred.
[02:41:03.868 --> 02:41:12.752]  They come together in their desire to reject reality because they say it's just a social construct.
[02:41:13.732 --> 02:41:16.033]  No, a penis means you're a boy.
[02:41:16.814 --> 02:41:19.155]  Yeah, it's not a social construct, bud.
[02:41:20.175 --> 02:41:21.616]  It's called biology.
[02:41:23.016 --> 02:41:24.337]  But that doesn't stop them, does it?
[02:41:28.042 --> 02:41:29.102]  Oh my gosh.
[02:41:30.103 --> 02:41:32.183]  This country's so whacked out, man.
[02:41:34.724 --> 02:41:35.705]  Is there really any hope?
[02:41:36.285 --> 02:41:36.545]  You know?
[02:41:36.565 --> 02:41:41.707]  I mean, if you could go to this level... Oh my gosh!
[02:41:46.288 --> 02:41:48.129]  So, we've got your calls getting lined up now.
[02:41:48.249 --> 02:41:54.831]  Oh, by the way... They're about to roll out the 5G technology, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:57.102 --> 02:41:57.762]  No hearings.
[02:41:58.623 --> 02:41:59.944]  No public health concerns.
[02:42:01.604 --> 02:42:02.245]  Just roll it out.
[02:42:02.685 --> 02:42:03.085]  And you know what?
[02:42:03.105 --> 02:42:04.466]  Maybe the 5G won't kill us.
[02:42:05.286 --> 02:42:06.607]  Maybe the 6G won't kill us.
[02:42:06.687 --> 02:42:07.828]  Maybe the 7G won't kill us.
[02:42:07.848 --> 02:42:10.149]  The 8G, 9G, 10G will just fry us.
[02:42:10.909 --> 02:42:14.551]  And then you'll have to plug in to the machine.
[02:42:14.611 --> 02:42:17.393]  Then you'll have to merge with the machine.
[02:42:17.433 --> 02:42:19.014]  You'll have to take the mark of the beast.
[02:42:21.636 --> 02:42:28.680]  But thanks to the Kavanaugh circus, nobody talks about the 5G being rolled out that could kill us all.
[02:42:34.103 --> 02:42:34.843]  So what's next?
[02:42:36.645 --> 02:42:41.227]  Kavanaugh was groping dogs when he was in high school?
[02:42:42.828 --> 02:42:44.609]  Is he pleasuring himself in the fruit aisle?
[02:42:44.689 --> 02:42:45.790]  I mean, what's going to happen next?
[02:42:45.870 --> 02:42:46.450]  I mean, who knows?
[02:42:46.470 --> 02:42:47.511]  The Democrats will go anywhere.
[02:42:47.531 --> 02:42:49.092]  We're taking your calls on the other side.
[02:42:49.112 --> 02:42:49.592]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:51.778 --> 02:42:59.026]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:42:59.406 --> 02:43:06.975]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:43:07.335 --> 02:43:10.439]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:43:11.059 --> 02:43:15.304]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:43:15.684 --> 02:43:19.608]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:43:19.829 --> 02:43:22.552]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:43:22.972 --> 02:43:27.257]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:43:27.737 --> 02:43:30.781]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:43:31.201 --> 02:43:46.038]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:43:46.278 --> 02:43:47.580]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:50.223]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:43:53.706 --> 02:43:59.151]  Leo Zegami is somebody who has broken hundreds of stories years before they come out.
[02:43:59.271 --> 02:44:06.538]  He's got the exclusive leozegami.com that Alexander Soros, now taking the mantle over from his father, forms shadow government with Obama.
[02:44:06.658 --> 02:44:09.560]  Leo Zegami, obviously this is critical information.
[02:44:09.621 --> 02:44:12.243]  People need to listen very, very, very carefully.
[02:44:12.443 --> 02:44:26.156]  The National Democratic Redistricting Committee has been shaped by the Soros as a new toy for the political relaunch of Obama and Michelle Obama, so the Obamas.
[02:44:26.616 --> 02:44:30.640]  This motto they have is also quite meaningful.
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:33.543]  The political system is rigged.
[02:44:33.603 --> 02:44:34.684]  They have rigged it.
[02:44:34.944 --> 02:44:35.885]  Of course it's rigged.
[02:44:36.285 --> 02:44:37.647]  But by them, not by us.
[02:44:38.227 --> 02:44:40.328]  And instead, they are throwing... Look, notice that.
[02:44:40.348 --> 02:44:42.348]  They're calling themselves the resistance.
[02:44:43.048 --> 02:44:49.430]  Everything we've said, they're now becoming that, then banning me to then step in as the body snatcher into the body.
[02:44:49.690 --> 02:44:51.090]  This is really ridiculous.
[02:44:51.190 --> 02:45:05.974]  I think that people should check out Alexander Soros as the new, really, puppet master of this new world order, because he's arriving from an experience as chairman, of course, of the Open Society.
[02:45:06.534 --> 02:45:08.116]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:45:24.133 --> 02:45:26.055]  That we're never gonna get rid of Soros!
[02:45:26.415 --> 02:45:41.286]  Father, son, this family is gonna continue pushing their New World Order and their democratic, progressive, liberal ways, and of course, in support of Pope Francis.
[02:45:41.406 --> 02:45:47.331]  The words that were published on Twitter on the 22nd of September by Alexander Soros are very revealing.
[02:45:47.531 --> 02:45:52.715]  He says, it was great to welcome President Barack Obama back into my home.
[02:45:53.556 --> 02:45:58.158]  ...this week and introduce him on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
[02:45:58.739 --> 02:46:00.179]  He says, my home!
[02:46:00.399 --> 02:46:01.220]  So what is his home?
[02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:02.120]  The Democratic Party?
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:05.662]  Is the Democratic Party the party of George Soros, Alexander Soros?
[02:46:06.262 --> 02:46:09.044]  Or is the party of the United States of America?
[02:46:09.304 --> 02:46:18.048]  So this is really revealing to the people, once and for all, who is really, who are the puppet masters here, who are pulling the strings.
[02:46:18.388 --> 02:46:23.131]  We got documents earlier this year in January that Alexander Soros was funding.
[02:46:23.151 --> 02:46:24.352]  Anybody can type this in.
[02:46:24.512 --> 02:46:30.777]  Leaked documents show Obama was planning martial law in Maryland in 2015 is the headline.
[02:46:31.137 --> 02:46:33.779]  And it's all their own documents, how they fund Antifa, how they do it.
[02:46:34.159 --> 02:46:38.462]  Antifa is allowed to dox people, threaten to kill people, harass people in restaurants.
[02:46:38.562 --> 02:46:39.502]  Twitter won't take them down.
[02:46:39.983 --> 02:46:43.525]  I confront a CNN reporter who's having me censored, I get banned on Twitter.
[02:46:43.545 --> 02:46:47.388]  So it shows the power of Antifa because Alexander Soros funds it.
[02:46:55.763 --> 02:46:59.944]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:08.087 --> 02:47:13.969]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:47:14.609 --> 02:47:16.250]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:47:16.870 --> 02:47:19.491]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:29.825 --> 02:47:35.067]  Infowarsstore.com is how we're able to stay alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:37.168 --> 02:47:38.989]  I know you know the censorship that we're under.
[02:47:39.029 --> 02:47:43.411]  I know you know how they're attacking our ability to fund ourselves right now, so...
[02:47:44.537 --> 02:47:46.839]  I'm not gonna patronize you on that, you know that.
[02:47:47.539 --> 02:47:50.541]  I'm gonna tell you the products at Infowarsstore.com are the real deal.
[02:47:51.142 --> 02:47:57.666]  I'm gonna tell you that Survival Shield X2 is a life-changing product, but don't take my word for it.
[02:47:59.227 --> 02:48:05.232]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and look at the thousands of five-star reviews on Survival Shield X2.
[02:48:07.153 --> 02:48:11.236]  Now this is a product for me that literally changed my life.
[02:48:12.397 --> 02:48:13.858]  It put me in touch with
[02:48:16.319 --> 02:48:23.463]  Best I could describe emotions and feelings and just parts of my brain that I could not access previously.
[02:48:23.803 --> 02:48:38.732]  And it's been linked to higher IQ, you know, the pineal gland has had ancient history and lore about being able to connect to your spiritual side, connect to God, your third eye is what it's called, and so it's under attack.
[02:48:39.727 --> 02:48:41.108]  When they put fluoride in the water.
[02:48:41.128 --> 02:48:44.970]  But the fluoride in the water gets into the food, and it gets into everything.
[02:48:44.990 --> 02:48:45.731]  You shower in it.
[02:48:46.491 --> 02:48:49.393]  So that's why Survival Shield X2 is so key, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:49.593 --> 02:48:53.716]  And again, I'm telling you that this changed my life, but don't take my word for it.
[02:48:53.876 --> 02:48:56.437]  Go read the thousands of five-star reviews, okay?
[02:48:57.018 --> 02:48:59.719]  Go read the customer reviews for yourself.
[02:48:59.980 --> 02:49:01.120]  And this is the last run.
[02:49:01.661 --> 02:49:04.182]  So I'm just saying, folks, take advantage of this now.
[02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:07.431]  Before it's gone.
[02:49:08.032 --> 02:49:11.796]  I mean, this is a game-changing... This thing goes in the Supplement Hall of Fame, right?
[02:49:11.816 --> 02:49:18.804]  I mean, this is like Tom Brady or Derek Jeter or something doing his last... It's his final season.
[02:49:19.564 --> 02:49:20.826]  It's the last month of the season.
[02:49:21.306 --> 02:49:22.968]  It's his retirement tour, right?
[02:49:23.008 --> 02:49:26.112]  Everybody wants to go see the final best player playing their final games.
[02:49:26.512 --> 02:49:27.633]  That's what this is right now.
[02:49:28.447 --> 02:49:31.788]  And then it goes into the Supplement Hall of Fame as one of the greatest of all time.
[02:49:31.828 --> 02:49:37.910]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine, get it at InfoWarsTore.com, and it's 25% off right now.
[02:49:37.970 --> 02:49:42.611]  That's not going to last probably through the weekend, so I'd take advantage of the 25% off.
[02:49:42.971 --> 02:49:46.292]  And then who knows how long we have Survival Shield X2.
[02:49:46.332 --> 02:49:49.233]  It could be a month, it could be two months, three months, I doubt it.
[02:49:50.334 --> 02:49:51.574]  So it's at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:49:51.594 --> 02:49:53.134]  Of course, hats, ball caps.
[02:49:53.395 --> 02:49:58.036]  If you're not using super blue fluoride-free toothpaste from InfoWarsTore.com, what are you doing?
[02:49:59.522 --> 02:50:00.343]  So there you go, folks.
[02:50:00.423 --> 02:50:02.385]  Huge specials at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:02.686 --> 02:50:04.087]  50% off Supermail Vitality.
[02:50:04.107 --> 02:50:06.130]  40% off Brain Force Plus.
[02:50:06.850 --> 02:50:07.511]  It's all there.
[02:50:07.711 --> 02:50:09.754]  In fact, the last two days...
[02:50:12.406 --> 02:50:21.655]  I don't, I usually only take Brain Force Plus if it's, you know, middle of the day or something and I'm a little drained mentally or I just need a little, a little pickup.
[02:50:22.536 --> 02:50:31.484]  But the last two mornings, because I've gotten up and just immediately focused on the hearings, it was like eight hours yesterday and then a couple hours this morning and today.
[02:50:32.145 --> 02:50:36.546]  I've been waking up and taking the BrainForce first thing in the morning so that I get rid of that brain fog.
[02:50:36.646 --> 02:50:37.406]  And so, boom!
[02:50:37.467 --> 02:50:41.308]  I hit the BrainForce in the morning and it's just like laser focus immediately.
[02:50:41.588 --> 02:50:42.668]  So no brain fog.
[02:50:43.508 --> 02:50:50.590]  So if you're one of those people, maybe you wake up, you go to work early, and it takes you an hour, half an hour, whatever, to kind of get focused.
[02:50:51.250 --> 02:50:56.092]  You hit the BrainForce, five minutes, you know, it's like, you're gone.
[02:50:56.272 --> 02:50:56.852]  You know, zero to 60.
[02:50:57.312 --> 02:50:59.313]  So, BrainForce Plus, also on sale.
[02:50:59.333 --> 02:51:00.333]  It's all at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:51:04.745 --> 02:51:06.605]  I'm going to say this and then I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:51:07.886 --> 02:51:15.147]  The Democrats have now successfully delayed the Supreme Court confirmation until November.
[02:51:15.487 --> 02:51:17.127]  That's what this is.
[02:51:17.947 --> 02:51:27.709]  So you won't have this Supreme Court justice on the court in October, which is going to begin session on Monday.
[02:51:28.749 --> 02:51:32.190]  So congrats to the Democrats, you've successfully used lies and propaganda.
[02:51:33.174 --> 02:51:36.817]  And you're mocking Bird Press and the CIA against the American people.
[02:51:36.877 --> 02:51:38.278]  Good for you, Democrats.
[02:51:38.778 --> 02:51:42.841]  You should really be proud of how scum, how disgusting you are.
[02:51:44.562 --> 02:51:46.023]  We should really be proud of the Democrats.
[02:51:46.223 --> 02:51:46.784]  And you know what?
[02:51:47.584 --> 02:51:48.625]  I actually have to say this.
[02:51:50.086 --> 02:51:53.168]  The Democrats actually have more courage than Republicans.
[02:51:53.889 --> 02:51:56.050]  The Democrats are actually braver than Republicans.
[02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.471]  You know why?
[02:51:56.551 --> 02:52:00.633]  Because, you know, I'll tell you, it takes some balls of steel.
[02:52:01.516 --> 02:52:07.398]  To go on the floor of Congress and collectively go along with a known lie.
[02:52:08.078 --> 02:52:19.321]  You gotta have some serious, serious chutzpah to get up there during these hearings and go with a known false narrative that you know you made up.
[02:52:21.342 --> 02:52:23.722]  You really need some bravery.
[02:52:26.055 --> 02:52:31.197]  To be Christine Blasey Ford, and in my view, perjure yourself with these false allegations.
[02:52:31.497 --> 02:52:35.759]  Of course, she'll get out of it by saying, oh, I was so drunk I must have forgot.
[02:52:36.519 --> 02:52:41.020]  That's how she'll get out of this perjury, by my estimation, this felony that she committed.
[02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:44.642]  But you gotta say, that takes a lot of courage, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:45.922 --> 02:52:47.803]  But for the Republicans to sit here and say,
[02:52:49.070 --> 02:52:50.911]  You know, I understand for the victim.
[02:52:51.532 --> 02:52:52.533]  I feel bad for her.
[02:52:52.993 --> 02:52:55.855]  You know, this isn't... No!
[02:52:57.116 --> 02:53:00.138]  No, she's a known CIA asset liar!
[02:53:00.619 --> 02:53:07.984]  Connected to the CIA, connected to the Clintons, through her lawyers, connected to Democrat movements, connected to the whole resist.
[02:53:08.424 --> 02:53:09.645]  Do we have the Chuck Schumer clip?
[02:53:14.089 --> 02:53:15.169]  I'm gonna take that as a no.
[02:53:16.030 --> 02:53:17.511]  Okay, we got the Schumer clip?
[02:53:17.931 --> 02:53:18.512]  Listen to this clip.
[02:53:20.060 --> 02:53:33.942]  Everything, everything that you see, everything that you hear, everything that we've seen is a result of what Chuck Schumer said right here.
[02:53:34.867 --> 02:53:38.089]  This intelligence briefing for the President-Elect was always planned for Friday.
[02:53:38.369 --> 02:53:39.289]  It hasn't been delayed.
[02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:45.232]  He's taking these shots, this antagonism is taunting to the intelligence community.
[02:53:45.412 --> 02:53:49.974]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[02:53:50.575 --> 02:53:56.238]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[02:53:56.278 --> 02:54:01.020]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were... I don't know, but from what I am told,
[02:54:01.733 --> 02:54:05.956]  They are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[02:54:05.976 --> 02:54:08.478]  Okay, I'll give you an idea of what the intelligence agency would do.
[02:54:10.319 --> 02:54:18.304]  They would implement somebody inside the Trump campaign as a stooge to get a warrant to spy.
[02:54:18.745 --> 02:54:27.811]  They would send somebody to a bar to get drunk with somebody, put an idea in his head to make him then go to the Trump campaign and say, I've got dirt from Russians to set him up.
[02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:36.357]  They would launch a full-on investigation then, after those two set-ups, to try to destroy the President of the United States.
[02:54:36.757 --> 02:54:51.671]  They will bring forth a woman to make accusations from 36 years ago, with no evidence, no corroboration, every witness says it didn't happen, to try to stop the Supreme Court from having a new justice.
[02:54:53.223 --> 02:54:55.844]  That's your six ways from Sundays, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:56.124 --> 02:54:57.624]  That's what Chuck Schumer was talking about.
[02:54:57.884 --> 02:55:04.145]  It's putting people on TV like Phil Mudd and other CIA assets to lie about President Trump.
[02:55:05.425 --> 02:55:08.286]  Chuck Schumer admitted it, and guess what?
[02:55:08.806 --> 02:55:10.627]  They're now telling you what they're going to do next, folks.
[02:55:10.847 --> 02:55:13.987]  They're going to get violent in the streets.
[02:55:14.087 --> 02:55:17.188]  They're going to activate their street
[02:55:18.407 --> 02:55:25.633]  Dogs to start intimidating, threatening, and getting physically violent with Republicans, with conservatives.
[02:55:26.754 --> 02:55:27.335]  You watch.
[02:55:28.916 --> 02:55:29.757]  But you know what?
[02:55:29.817 --> 02:55:30.558]  Let's give in.
[02:55:30.878 --> 02:55:31.278]  You know what?
[02:55:31.298 --> 02:55:36.883]  Let's not nominate Kavanaugh because then the Democrats are going to activate their domestic terror groups.
[02:55:37.784 --> 02:55:38.845]  And we don't want that.
[02:55:39.706 --> 02:55:41.808]  We just want to believe the victim.
[02:55:43.894 --> 02:55:45.316]  Ridiculous, this country.
[02:55:45.756 --> 02:55:50.501]  So Democrats have more courage than Republicans because Republicans won't call a known liar a liar.
[02:55:50.882 --> 02:55:53.364]  Republicans, I mean, do you know all the connections?
[02:55:53.404 --> 02:55:55.687]  I'm sorry, I meant to go to your phone calls, but this is just ridiculous.
[02:55:57.008 --> 02:56:02.892]  Like, do you know all the connections with Blasey Ford and the Democrat Party?
[02:56:03.292 --> 02:56:04.874]  With Blasey Ford and the CIA?
[02:56:05.594 --> 02:56:06.935]  Uh-oh.
[02:56:06.955 --> 02:56:10.017]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:56:10.217 --> 02:56:16.222]  Even Blasey Ford's parents and Kavanaugh's parents have a connection.
[02:56:18.243 --> 02:56:22.086]  And people think that this may be some retribution for a
[02:56:24.148 --> 02:56:27.509]  Was it a foreclosure on a house deal or an eviction deal?
[02:56:28.149 --> 02:56:32.109]  When Kavanaugh's mom had this court case of Blasey Ford's parents?
[02:56:32.349 --> 02:56:52.413]  I mean, it's all insane, it's all totally made up, but because Republicans are so weak-kneed, because Republicans are so PC, they don't have the courage to come up and say, except Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz to an extent, this is a Democrat con job, these are made-up allegations, if you can't see that, you're an idiot!
[02:56:55.037 --> 02:56:58.780]  And people like Sheldon Whitehouse, I mean, these people know who they are.
[02:56:59.500 --> 02:57:00.721]  These people know the lie.
[02:57:01.141 --> 02:57:02.122]  They know what they're doing.
[02:57:02.662 --> 02:57:03.443]  Are you kidding me?
[02:57:04.904 --> 02:57:05.684]  Are you serious?
[02:57:06.905 --> 02:57:09.827]  But again, you see, this is why Republicans
[02:57:11.511 --> 02:57:13.632]  At least this brand of Republican will never win.
[02:57:13.832 --> 02:57:14.932]  You want to defeat these people?
[02:57:15.252 --> 02:57:21.575]  You go with the castle chess move, you pull a switcheroo, and then you investigate Blasey Ford, and you nominate Barrett Cohen.
[02:57:22.255 --> 02:57:29.138]  Or, you find a couple women from Chuck Schumer's past, a couple women from Cory Booker's past, a couple women from Sheldon Whitehouse's past.
[02:57:29.478 --> 02:57:29.578]  Oh!
[02:57:30.058 --> 02:57:35.000]  I was at a party with Sheldon Whitehouse, and he groped me when I was passed out drunk on a bed.
[02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:38.982]  Now, I was passed out drunk, so maybe it wasn't him, but I think it was him, because he was there.
[02:57:39.242 --> 02:57:40.002]  He must resign.
[02:57:46.557 --> 02:57:59.304]  Alex, speaking of food, I do have to mention to you that on Monday night, I was invited out to dinner by a New York Times reporter, and he said that it was on him, which meant it was on Carlos Slim.
[02:57:59.904 --> 02:58:11.250]  And therefore, I took him to the finest steakhouse in all of South Florida, where I knew they had an incredible 48-ounce porterhouse that is just a thing to behold.
[02:58:11.270 --> 02:58:11.971]  Okay, I'm getting hungry.
[02:58:12.551 --> 02:58:12.771]  I don't
[02:58:31.903 --> 02:58:36.488]  We have the situation where this just sits in your gut and ferments.
[02:58:36.628 --> 02:58:41.053]  The enzymes that are used in carnivore help you to gently digest.
[02:58:41.073 --> 02:58:44.857]  You don't end up like John Wayne with 45 pounds of undigested Hillary Clinton in your guts.
[02:58:45.657 --> 02:58:46.939]  I mean it's exactly right.
[02:58:47.399 --> 02:58:52.104]  In this case my digestive disease disappeared like that.
[02:58:52.124 --> 02:58:54.787]  This is a truly great product and right
[02:58:55.487 --> 02:58:59.589]  Right now, $23.42 on a special price worth every penny of it.
[02:58:59.649 --> 02:59:11.334]  So the next time you're going to gouge Carlos Slim and hand him a restaurant bill of a couple hundred bucks for some of the finest beef in the United States, make sure you've got your bottle of carnivore first.
[02:59:11.574 --> 02:59:14.655]  I must tell you, it was outstanding, but the best thing about it?
[02:59:15.195 --> 02:59:17.116]  It was being paid for by the Native Americans.
[02:59:17.136 --> 02:59:21.158]  Well, there's nothing better than a glass of red wine, a big ol' juicy porterhouse and potatoes gratin.
[02:59:21.698 --> 02:59:22.479]  And some asparagus.
[02:59:22.499 --> 02:59:24.540]  But like I said, I gotta get a driver when I do that.
[02:59:24.620 --> 02:59:25.761]  Actual Uber or whatever.
[02:59:26.082 --> 02:59:29.184]  Because when I get home, it's like BOOM!
[02:59:29.304 --> 02:59:31.586]  We're talking sleep for 12 hours when I eat a pork house.
[02:59:31.666 --> 02:59:33.508]  Yeah, it's called the food coma.
[02:59:33.628 --> 02:59:36.550]  But you can avoid the negative effects with carnivore.
[02:59:46.158 --> 02:59:49.801]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:01.431 --> 03:00:02.331]  You found it.
[03:00:02.611 --> 03:00:04.172]  The tip of the spear.
[03:00:04.652 --> 03:00:08.754]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[03:00:09.134 --> 03:00:13.175]  Alright, I'm not gonna delay.
[03:00:13.195 --> 03:00:14.576]  I'm gonna get right to your phone calls.
[03:00:14.936 --> 03:00:16.997]  Charlie's calling in from California.
[03:00:17.017 --> 03:00:17.457]  It's funny.
[03:00:17.597 --> 03:00:20.198]  On the board it says, uh, Dr. Ford in hearings.
[03:00:20.258 --> 03:00:20.938]  Look staged.
[03:00:21.778 --> 03:00:22.899]  And I'm not insulting Charlie.
[03:00:22.939 --> 03:00:23.379]  It's just like...
[03:00:24.471 --> 03:00:25.011]  Duh!
[03:00:25.031 --> 03:00:26.252]  Like, that's what I'm saying.
[03:00:26.272 --> 03:00:28.072]  It's like, duh, it's staged!
[03:00:28.592 --> 03:00:29.213]  And here's my thing.
[03:00:30.013 --> 03:00:32.894]  I'm not afraid to go, I'm not afraid to be anti-PC.
[03:00:32.994 --> 03:00:36.755]  I'm not afraid to go with my gut instinct and say, that woman is lying, in my opinion.
[03:00:37.975 --> 03:00:39.896]  And, I mean, look, I'm just gonna go on.
[03:00:39.936 --> 03:00:40.776]  Let's just go to Charli.
[03:00:40.796 --> 03:00:42.137]  Let's hear from Charli in California.
[03:00:42.157 --> 03:00:42.457]  Go ahead.
[03:00:43.757 --> 03:00:44.698]  Hi, this is Charli.
[03:00:44.898 --> 03:00:48.319]  And so, yeah, I was watching the whole Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh and, uh,
[03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:50.840]  I don't
[03:01:13.189 --> 03:01:14.290]  And who is this woman?
[03:01:14.410 --> 03:01:15.291]  And who is this woman?
[03:01:15.631 --> 03:01:17.192]  And Charla, I can't tell if you're on speakerphone.
[03:01:17.212 --> 03:01:18.334]  I'm sorry, I'm having trouble hearing you.
[03:01:18.374 --> 03:01:19.074]  If you are, please switch.
[03:01:19.375 --> 03:01:26.061]  And who is this woman from Arizona doing the questioning, grills Kavanaugh, and lets Blasey Ford off with a pass?
[03:01:26.361 --> 03:01:26.942]  Excuse me?
[03:01:27.603 --> 03:01:29.024]  How come nobody heard you?
[03:01:29.344 --> 03:01:33.108]  You say there were five people in a house and there was no other music on except the music in the room.
[03:01:33.388 --> 03:01:34.288]  Nobody heard you?
[03:01:34.649 --> 03:01:35.769]  Nobody remembers anything?
[03:01:35.789 --> 03:01:38.270]  I mean, like, why isn't she the one being grilled?
[03:01:38.430 --> 03:01:43.933]  And I'm sorry, but if you're going to do this right, you have to ask, okay, you know, how did your clothes get off?
[03:01:44.453 --> 03:01:45.353]  Where did he touch you?
[03:01:45.593 --> 03:01:47.034]  Did he penetrate you?
[03:01:47.414 --> 03:01:49.035]  Yeah, this is graphic, this is gross.
[03:01:49.335 --> 03:01:50.836]  That's what you have to ask this woman.
[03:01:51.076 --> 03:01:52.176]  That's what she's alleging.
[03:01:52.516 --> 03:01:55.558]  Oh, but, oh, you know, do you remember that night?
[03:01:55.698 --> 03:01:57.639]  Like, you know, I'm sure it was hard for you.
[03:01:58.700 --> 03:02:02.365]  They're asking about like, you know, oh, you know, why did you fly here?
[03:02:02.445 --> 03:02:04.949]  And then oh, it's just give me a break!
[03:02:07.364 --> 03:02:12.148]  Dude, it was just really sad to watch and I was surprised that no Republicans were grilling her.
[03:02:12.248 --> 03:02:18.814]  I was like expecting some Republicans to be like, well you know what, how do you not remember how the hell you got there if you were sober?
[03:02:18.854 --> 03:02:23.518]  If you were 15 fighting for your life, you wouldn't be reading this manuscript like it's nothing.
[03:02:23.558 --> 03:02:25.259]  And like literally there was no emotion.
[03:02:25.299 --> 03:02:26.880]  It just seemed so bad.
[03:02:26.981 --> 03:02:28.061]  It's so ridiculous.
[03:02:28.101 --> 03:02:28.542]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:02:28.562 --> 03:02:34.327]  It's like, I mean honestly, it's like, do we need to do like a whole broadcast where we all sit here and talk about high school?
[03:02:34.847 --> 03:02:35.547]  I remember.
[03:02:36.228 --> 03:02:41.871]  No, seriously, like, I could sit here and I could give you, like, every detail of almost every high school party I was at.
[03:02:42.011 --> 03:02:42.852]  I'm not even kidding you.
[03:02:43.152 --> 03:02:44.072]  I remember all of them.
[03:02:44.392 --> 03:02:45.553]  And I drank in most of them.
[03:02:47.014 --> 03:02:48.254]  I remember how I got there.
[03:02:48.335 --> 03:02:49.395]  I remember who was there.
[03:02:49.495 --> 03:02:50.656]  I remember who I talked to.
[03:02:50.736 --> 03:02:52.357]  I remember how many games of beer pong I won.
[03:02:53.717 --> 03:02:57.580]  Oh, you know, someone took me up to the room, but, you know.
[03:02:57.780 --> 03:03:00.901]  Oh, and then she's like, tell me about the map of the neighborhood.
[03:03:01.102 --> 03:03:02.522]  Can you map out the house?
[03:03:03.183 --> 03:03:03.423]  What?
[03:03:04.650 --> 03:03:04.750]  Yeah.
[03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:28.372]  I was told, you know, to write a diary.
[03:03:28.392 --> 03:03:30.134]  Like, it's always nice for a journal of your life.
[03:03:30.194 --> 03:03:31.496]  It's always nice to look back on things.
[03:03:31.896 --> 03:03:35.780]  And when I heard about his, uh, calendar and his diary, like, my heart just dropped.
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:37.162]  I'm like, this guy is so innocent.
[03:03:37.462 --> 03:03:39.344]  And then, um, what's his name?
[03:03:39.625 --> 03:03:44.310]  Uh, Cory Booker and some other girl were laughing at him while he was doing his questions.
[03:03:44.390 --> 03:03:45.071]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:03:45.151 --> 03:03:45.451]  No, no, no.
[03:03:45.611 --> 03:03:46.512]  They're all laughing.
[03:03:47.313 --> 03:03:48.614]  We could pull up all the images.
[03:03:48.694 --> 03:03:51.795]  In fact, guys, go to the War Room Memes Twitter account.
[03:03:51.915 --> 03:03:53.256]  I retweeted, like, five images.
[03:03:53.536 --> 03:03:55.077]  The Democrats are all laughing!
[03:03:55.437 --> 03:03:56.817]  They're, like, cheersing one another!
[03:03:56.857 --> 03:03:58.498]  Blasey Ford!
[03:03:59.258 --> 03:04:00.619]  I didn't see Kavanaugh laughing!
[03:04:00.839 --> 03:04:02.480]  I didn't see Kavanaugh having any fun!
[03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:08.062]  I didn't see a Republican Congresswoman go over to Kavanaugh and hand him an envelope of God knows what!
[03:04:08.322 --> 03:04:09.423]  That's all the Democrats!
[03:04:11.143 --> 03:04:13.066]  And by the way, thank you so much for the call, Charlie.
[03:04:13.887 --> 03:04:19.936]  So the Democrats are all laughing, having a good time, you know, it's all fun and games, even though they're claiming this man is a gang rapist.
[03:04:20.216 --> 03:04:21.258]  But let me tell you something right now.
[03:04:23.464 --> 03:04:29.666]  The first Republican that comes out and calls Blasey Ford a liar is the first champion we've had in Congress in a long time.
[03:04:29.706 --> 03:04:42.490]  Because let me tell you something, if the Democrats are willing to come out and call Brett Kavanaugh a gang rapist, but Republicans don't even have the courage to come out and call Christine Blasey Ford a liar, then they will never win this battle.
[03:04:42.650 --> 03:04:44.050]  The Democrats have no limits.
[03:04:44.270 --> 03:04:45.731]  The Democrats have no boundaries.
[03:04:45.751 --> 03:04:50.152]  It's time for Republicans to take the gloves off and call this woman what she is, a liar!
[03:04:52.950 --> 03:05:02.575]  Just a month ago, that Nazi collaborator, anti-American, gun-grabbing, anti-Christian piece of filth, George Soros, bought an even bigger interest in PayPal.
[03:05:03.696 --> 03:05:08.799]  But sure enough, they just told us today that we're going to be banned in 10 days because we're hateful.
[03:05:08.859 --> 03:05:12.241]  Because we don't support radical Islam and open borders and the rest of it.
[03:05:13.624 --> 03:05:19.109]  Ladies and gentlemen, now more than ever, you supporting InfoWars is changing the world.
[03:05:20.050 --> 03:05:23.432]  And yeah, they're getting rid of PayPal, but we have other ways to process your credit cards.
[03:05:23.933 --> 03:05:29.978]  Your financial support of us is literally buying war bonds in the 21st century war for humanity.
[03:05:30.018 --> 03:05:31.259]  So I want to commend you.
[03:05:31.279 --> 03:05:32.320]  I want to thank you.
[03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:33.981]  We've got great products you already need.
[03:05:35.356 --> 03:05:36.996]  But without you, they will win.
[03:05:37.637 --> 03:05:45.059]  And Soros and Obama and Hillary see the shutdown of Infowars as a referendum on breaking the American spirit.
[03:05:45.619 --> 03:05:47.219]  So let's not let these jerks do it.
[03:05:47.579 --> 03:05:49.600]  I'm committed to the end, but I want to win.
[03:05:49.900 --> 03:05:52.541]  So please support InfowarsStore.com today.
[03:05:58.143 --> 03:05:59.984]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:00.044 --> 03:06:06.426]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:06.886 --> 03:06:10.088]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:06:10.908 --> 03:06:15.190]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls here.
[03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:16.070]  Oh!
[03:06:16.090 --> 03:06:21.212]  You know, Christine Blasey Ford said that she has nothing to gain.
[03:06:22.324 --> 03:06:23.304]  By giving a testimony.
[03:06:23.365 --> 03:06:24.025]  Nothing to gain.
[03:06:24.125 --> 03:06:24.485]  Oh, really?
[03:06:24.965 --> 03:06:28.447]  Three separate GoFundMe accounts and she's raised almost $700,000.
[03:06:30.988 --> 03:06:32.068]  Probably more than that now.
[03:06:32.109 --> 03:06:33.229]  That was as of yesterday.
[03:06:33.649 --> 03:06:37.751]  So nothing to gain, but she's raised probably a million dollars on GoFundMe accounts.
[03:06:43.394 --> 03:06:43.754]  So, yep.
[03:06:47.956 --> 03:06:50.337]  I just can't believe that we're letting the Democrats get away with this.
[03:06:53.260 --> 03:06:57.522]  Look at the pictures of Christine Blasey Ford laughing it up during the hearing.
[03:06:57.623 --> 03:06:58.983]  Laughing it up with the Democrats.
[03:06:59.203 --> 03:07:00.484]  Cory Booker laughing it up.
[03:07:00.524 --> 03:07:01.785]  Kamala Harris laughing it up.
[03:07:01.825 --> 03:07:02.766]  Feinstein laughing it up.
[03:07:02.946 --> 03:07:03.846]  They're all laughing it up.
[03:07:04.206 --> 03:07:07.028]  This is a woman that they claim is a victim of sexual assault.
[03:07:07.248 --> 03:07:09.870]  I mean, we're talking, you know, rape?
[03:07:11.431 --> 03:07:13.572]  That's what they're claiming Kavanaugh did to this woman is raped her.
[03:07:14.052 --> 03:07:15.673]  And here she is so brave.
[03:07:16.033 --> 03:07:17.754]  She's so brave to come forward.
[03:07:18.615 --> 03:07:20.076]  So brave that she laughs it off?
[03:07:22.117 --> 03:07:22.277]  No.
[03:07:23.982 --> 03:07:27.345]  No, the real bravery is that she's willing to lie under oath.
[03:07:27.605 --> 03:07:28.626]  That's the bravery!
[03:07:28.986 --> 03:07:33.210]  The real bravery is the Democrats collectively going with a known lie.
[03:07:34.231 --> 03:07:35.572]  That's the true bravery here.
[03:07:35.953 --> 03:07:42.578]  And if there's any Republican that has a set, they would call Christine Blasey Ford a liar.
[03:07:46.942 --> 03:07:48.824]  Again, you say,
[03:07:49.865 --> 03:07:50.326]  Oh, Owen.
[03:07:50.926 --> 03:07:52.187]  You need to be more PC.
[03:07:52.667 --> 03:07:53.548]  You can't say that.
[03:07:53.748 --> 03:07:55.349]  This is a woman who could be a victim.
[03:07:56.409 --> 03:07:56.689]  Really?
[03:07:57.670 --> 03:08:02.893]  The Democrats are calling this man a gang rapist, and you're gonna tell me I can't call her a liar?
[03:08:02.913 --> 03:08:05.195]  Huh.
[03:08:06.535 --> 03:08:07.296]  Not in my world.
[03:08:08.637 --> 03:08:12.279]  Let's go back out to the phone lines and go to Adam in Connecticut.
[03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:13.880]  Go ahead, Adam.
[03:08:15.081 --> 03:08:15.681]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:08:16.742 --> 03:08:18.383]  Well, I'm good, but I'll tell ya,
[03:08:19.451 --> 03:08:27.296]  The state of this country is in serious need for repair if the Democrats are able to get away with this and have no punishment.
[03:08:28.216 --> 03:08:33.039]  Well, first of all, I want to thank you guys for your courageous government on all this.
[03:08:35.181 --> 03:08:37.542]  Second of all, I don't think this is an attack on Kavanaugh.
[03:08:38.266 --> 03:08:41.953]  I think this is at the big enchilada, the next election.
[03:08:42.433 --> 03:08:43.636]  They want to draw Trump out.
[03:08:43.896 --> 03:08:44.918]  They're trying to piss him off.
[03:08:44.938 --> 03:08:47.582]  They're trying to make him do stupid stuff on social media.
[03:08:47.622 --> 03:08:49.946]  They're trying to make him overstep his bounds.
[03:08:51.078 --> 03:08:56.621]  I think this is them picking on his boy to get the big fish is what this is all about.
[03:08:56.901 --> 03:09:01.184]  Well, you're right, because it doesn't matter who Trump nominated, it would have been the same thing.
[03:09:01.824 --> 03:09:06.146]  And of course, this is all in response, just like everything has been, to Trump winning the election.
[03:09:06.707 --> 03:09:15.411]  But they're pushing this now, and they got successful, so they won't have another Supreme Court, at least another Supreme Court Justice, at least until November is in session.
[03:09:17.572 --> 03:09:29.839]  Their real hope here, because they know that the blue wave is not happening, so they want to try to stop anything from happening before the midterms and do anything they can before the midterms before they even lose more congressional power.
[03:09:32.041 --> 03:09:34.222]  Yeah, they're trying to draw Trump out.
[03:09:35.203 --> 03:09:36.884]  Like you said, it didn't matter who it was.
[03:09:37.144 --> 03:09:38.905]  This was an attack on Trump.
[03:09:39.725 --> 03:09:42.847]  This is them saying, look, we just gave your buddy a bloody nose.
[03:09:42.867 --> 03:09:43.848]  What are you going to do about it?
[03:09:44.355 --> 03:09:47.536]  They're waiting for him to do something stupid so they could turn around and say, look, see?
[03:09:47.596 --> 03:09:48.216]  He's crazy.
[03:09:48.876 --> 03:09:49.777]  Like we've been saying.
[03:09:51.557 --> 03:09:59.719]  Well... I know that there's stuff going on behind the scenes.
[03:09:59.919 --> 03:10:00.960]  I don't know to what extent.
[03:10:01.060 --> 03:10:01.900]  I don't know to how much.
[03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:05.121]  I'm not going to sit here and say I'm a Q believer.
[03:10:05.221 --> 03:10:07.341]  I'd love to believe that that's all true.
[03:10:07.421 --> 03:10:11.042]  But, you know, I can't sit here and believe in fairy tales.
[03:10:13.706 --> 03:10:30.939]  Trump needs to take the gloves off, and I'm telling you, they've now given him the perfect opportunity to pull a Castle move and say, okay, I'm pulling my nomination for Kavanaugh, we're going to have your investigations, and we're going to investigate Blasey Ford too, because one of these two lied under oath.
[03:10:31.700 --> 03:10:36.343]  So both of them warrant an investigation, and we know what will come from that investigation.
[03:10:36.383 --> 03:10:40.627]  Blasey Ford, CIA asset probably, paid for by the Democrats, it's all going to come out.
[03:10:41.596 --> 03:10:42.436]  It's all already out.
[03:10:43.097 --> 03:10:48.879]  And that investigation would prove what the Democrats have done whole cloth.
[03:10:49.639 --> 03:10:50.599]  Now is Trump going to do that?
[03:10:50.659 --> 03:10:52.280]  Is he going to let the Democrats get away with this?
[03:10:52.640 --> 03:10:53.820]  I guess we're left to find out.
[03:10:56.897 --> 03:11:04.540]  They have now changed the course of this country, whether or not Trump gets his Supreme Court nomination through or not.
[03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:08.522]  Because anytime there's a Supreme Court justice nominated, this is what we're going to see now.
[03:11:08.782 --> 03:11:09.342]  A circus.
[03:11:09.602 --> 03:11:10.263]  A freak show.
[03:11:10.863 --> 03:11:16.945]  So democracy is now dead because Democrats have no... They'll lie about anything.
[03:11:16.985 --> 03:11:17.526]  They don't care.
[03:11:17.866 --> 03:11:20.647]  And Republicans are too cowardly and PC to call them out on it.
[03:11:21.027 --> 03:11:21.907]  So that's where we're at now.
[03:11:21.967 --> 03:11:22.728]  Thanks for the call, Adam.
[03:11:23.547 --> 03:11:26.750]  Let's go to Chris in Illinois.
[03:11:26.810 --> 03:11:27.530]  Go ahead, Chris.
[03:11:31.173 --> 03:11:31.693]  Hello, Owen?
[03:11:32.374 --> 03:11:32.834]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:11:34.015 --> 03:11:35.516]  Hey, MKUltra, man.
[03:11:35.777 --> 03:11:38.499]  I think that's what it is with this broad.
[03:11:39.059 --> 03:11:49.668]  And the other thing is, I was watching it pretty much all day yesterday, and twice Brett Hume mentioned that he knew Ford's father as well as Kavanaugh's father.
[03:11:51.296 --> 03:11:55.340]  Then last night, Joe Genova pointed out an interesting point.
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:00.324]  He said, Blasey Ford about flying back and forth and all that crap.
[03:12:00.885 --> 03:12:04.788]  She was actually on the East Coast the entire time.
[03:12:06.309 --> 03:12:15.097]  So I don't know if anyone's looked into that, but you think she was out there sipping martinis or getting geared up with their programming?
[03:12:15.837 --> 03:12:16.518]  You know, because that's
[03:12:17.065 --> 03:12:19.409]  The way she acted looked classic MKUltra.
[03:12:19.549 --> 03:12:20.891]  I've been around some of that stuff before.
[03:12:20.912 --> 03:12:28.845]  You know, so I think they were gearing her up, getting her program, but I think somebody should definitely look into the fact that she was probably
[03:12:29.804 --> 03:12:32.146]  On the East Coast most of the time anyway.
[03:12:52.341 --> 03:12:53.842]  You have to fight fire with fire.
[03:12:53.902 --> 03:12:59.606]  The reason why the Democrats get away with this crap is because they call him a gang rapist and nobody calls him a liar!
[03:13:01.668 --> 03:13:02.949]  I'm on the ground here in Chicago.
[03:13:02.969 --> 03:13:03.529]  I'm in sales.
[03:13:03.589 --> 03:13:04.570]  I drive around all day.
[03:13:04.590 --> 03:13:07.312]  I was in the office this morning and I'm telling you though,
[03:13:08.086 --> 03:13:08.647]  I have a theory.
[03:13:08.667 --> 03:13:13.274]  I think the longer that the Democrats keep pulling this crap, I mean, it's just pissing more people off.
[03:13:13.294 --> 03:13:14.296]  Well, this is actually good.
[03:13:14.316 --> 03:13:19.585]  See, Chris, you're in Illinois, and I think Illinois is actually going to be one of the best case studies for this.
[03:13:19.645 --> 03:13:21.828]  Now, Chicago is probably going to go blue no matter what.
[03:13:23.251 --> 03:13:24.612]  I have a lot of family in Illinois.
[03:13:24.652 --> 03:13:27.234]  I spent a lot of time in Illinois growing up in St.
[03:13:27.274 --> 03:13:27.814]  Louis, Missouri.
[03:13:27.834 --> 03:13:35.499]  And I'm going to tell you, even though there's a lot of Democrats in Illinois, legitimate blue-collar Democrats, they're capitalists.
[03:13:35.579 --> 03:13:37.240]  They don't like the PC culture.
[03:13:37.260 --> 03:13:39.621]  They're still going to tell you like it is.
[03:13:39.681 --> 03:13:40.822]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:13:40.862 --> 03:13:42.383]  So Illinois is the perfect example.
[03:13:42.663 --> 03:13:48.687]  I think the average Democrat voter in Illinois looks at this and says, this is ridiculous.
[03:13:49.708 --> 03:13:50.708]  Democrats going socialist?
[03:13:50.748 --> 03:13:51.349]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:13:52.475 --> 03:13:56.557]  The red wave is inevitable, unless they just steal it via the electronic voting system.
[03:13:57.537 --> 03:14:06.821]  One of the other interesting things, my wife, who's a social worker, a master of social work, you know... I think Illinois has some of the most social workers in the country.
[03:14:07.101 --> 03:14:09.042]  It's part of their problem why they're in so much debt, even.
[03:14:09.622 --> 03:14:17.925]  Well, right, but she's not... I mean, she's conservative, but she came downstairs yesterday after watching Judge Kavanaugh, and she was bawling.
[03:14:18.485 --> 03:14:22.067]  And her exact words were, and she's not that conservative, man, she was saying,
[03:14:22.805 --> 03:14:24.246]  They're destroying this man's life.
[03:14:24.406 --> 03:14:26.246]  This is bull, you know what.
[03:14:26.846 --> 03:14:28.007]  And I was like, yeah.
[03:14:28.827 --> 03:14:30.888]  And then finally Lindsey Graham got on his course.
[03:14:31.628 --> 03:14:33.589]  And I mean, I was inspired by that.
[03:14:33.669 --> 03:14:37.010]  In fact, I called Lindsey Graham's office and I said, man, I left a message.
[03:14:37.090 --> 03:14:37.830]  I said, thanks.
[03:14:37.870 --> 03:14:38.330]  Oh my gosh.
[03:14:38.410 --> 03:14:38.970]  Oh my gosh.
[03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.871]  Oh my gosh, Chris.
[03:14:40.031 --> 03:14:40.411]  Oh my gosh.
[03:14:40.431 --> 03:14:40.931]  You're brilliant.
[03:14:41.331 --> 03:14:41.831]  Oh my gosh.
[03:14:42.772 --> 03:14:43.152]  That's it.
[03:14:44.190 --> 03:14:46.932]  Everyone has to call Lindsey Graham's office today and say how great he is.
[03:14:47.273 --> 03:14:53.417]  Everyone has to call Lindsey Graham's office and say thank you so much for being the only Republican willing to call this Democrat con job out.
[03:14:54.378 --> 03:14:54.879]  Boom!
[03:14:55.119 --> 03:14:55.679]  That's it!
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:14:57.961]  Because listen, think about this.
[03:14:58.081 --> 03:14:58.522]  Think about this.
[03:14:59.903 --> 03:15:02.665]  Lindsey Graham is coming more in line with Trump.
[03:15:03.426 --> 03:15:07.509]  Everybody's talking about how Lindsey Graham finally grew some frickin' balls.
[03:15:08.329 --> 03:15:09.030]  And I'm telling ya.
[03:15:09.290 --> 03:15:10.231]  And you know what?
[03:15:10.791 --> 03:15:12.633]  You gotta reinforce with these Republicans
[03:15:13.157 --> 03:15:15.281]  Get on board, or get the hell out.
[03:15:15.441 --> 03:15:19.488]  And I'm telling you, when they get on board, they're gonna get broad line support.
[03:15:19.508 --> 03:15:20.690]  Because people are tired of this crap.
[03:15:20.730 --> 03:15:21.211]  Bingo!
[03:15:21.451 --> 03:15:21.832]  Bingo!
[03:15:21.952 --> 03:15:23.214]  And someone like Lindsey Graham...
[03:15:24.318 --> 03:15:25.118]  Google is developing an app
[03:15:53.943 --> 03:15:59.607]  To screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens.
[03:16:00.308 --> 03:16:00.969]  Translation?
[03:16:01.749 --> 03:16:06.413]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[03:16:06.613 --> 03:16:14.919]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior.
[03:16:14.939 --> 03:16:20.904]  A high rating means you get benefits like no deposit of renting house or skipping airport security.
[03:16:21.164 --> 03:16:25.629]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[03:16:36.800 --> 03:16:37.901]  You know Google's really the C.I.N.
[03:17:02.415 --> 03:17:08.137]  But it's leftist run now, so it's brought over to China, and it's a civil war inside the intelligence agency.
[03:17:08.317 --> 03:17:16.741]  These are serious people plotting to finagle the searches, which is what Google sells to us as being fair and unbiased.
[03:17:16.881 --> 03:17:23.303]  Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any American election just by altering its search suggestions.
[03:17:23.724 --> 03:17:24.684]  We'd never know what happened.
[03:17:24.684 --> 03:17:34.212]  Well, Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:17:34.252 --> 03:17:36.014]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:17:36.094 --> 03:17:46.823]  So Google won't work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, but it's officially moved its main operations for AI to China and is merging with the Chinese government, letting them have all the technology.
[03:17:46.963 --> 03:17:59.235]  So they're working on behalf of the fascist Chinese government, sending propaganda to its people to keep them under the control of the government, but we shouldn't worry about the fact that they have a chokehold on all human information in English.
[03:17:59.395 --> 03:17:59.976]  Not a big deal.
[03:18:00.696 --> 03:18:02.578]  I mean, that's a lot you just said there, but I...
[03:18:03.880 --> 03:18:11.286]  So Google always swears that its liberal, anti-Trump views of the top people doesn't affect the search product.
[03:18:11.787 --> 03:18:17.232]  But here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political actives.
[03:18:17.272 --> 03:18:21.876]  The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily.
[03:18:22.256 --> 03:18:26.220]  They have more than a million Muslims in re-education camps.
[03:18:26.620 --> 03:18:32.264]  But the legitimate election of President Trump somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values?
[03:18:32.884 --> 03:18:34.545]  Give me a break.
[03:18:34.825 --> 03:18:37.267]  Google was working to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[03:18:37.407 --> 03:18:48.834]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[03:18:48.974 --> 03:18:51.796]  A new bombshell development reveals Hillary Clinton's
[03:18:52.276 --> 03:18:57.880]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[03:19:22.276 --> 03:19:23.197]  Working with Big Tech.
[03:19:23.317 --> 03:19:26.239]  You're not allowed to get the InfoWars official app on your iPhone.
[03:19:26.259 --> 03:19:31.403]  You're not allowed to watch the Alex Jones Show on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.
[03:19:32.183 --> 03:19:43.931]  But if you're the Chinese government and you want access to every citizen and all their data and everything they've ever done on an Apple product, good to go, baby.
[03:19:44.972 --> 03:19:45.532]  Good to go.
[03:19:46.273 --> 03:19:49.055]  And the left in America loves it.
[03:19:56.269 --> 03:20:00.870]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:05.591 --> 03:20:07.192]  It's mind control.
[03:20:07.912 --> 03:20:11.133]  Mind control.
[03:20:11.193 --> 03:20:13.894]  Corruption of your thoughts.
[03:20:13.954 --> 03:20:15.474]  Destruction of your soul.
[03:20:19.309 --> 03:20:22.652]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the last caller, Chris, had a brilliant idea.
[03:20:23.893 --> 03:20:33.583]  Call Lindsey Graham's office, 202, this is his DC office, 202-224-5972.
[03:20:34.163 --> 03:20:40.669]  Try to get through, leave a voicemail, whatever, and thank him for having the courage to call the Democrat con job out for what it is.
[03:20:41.130 --> 03:20:42.151]  And here's what happens, folks.
[03:20:43.803 --> 03:20:54.328]  Then Lindsey Graham gets more courage and more energy to do the same even harder, and then he tells other Republicans that then they may do the same, and then you call their office and you thank them.
[03:20:57.029 --> 03:20:57.889]  This is what we have to do.
[03:20:57.989 --> 03:20:59.770]  So guys, pull it up one more time.
[03:21:00.757 --> 03:21:08.262]  Everyone needs to call Lindsey Graham's office and thank him for the courage to call out the Democrat con job against Brett Kavanaugh for what it is.
[03:21:08.282 --> 03:21:11.705]  202-224-5972.
[03:21:12.025 --> 03:21:17.489]  Take five minutes, make the call, energize Lindsey Graham, do it to Ted Cruz too.
[03:21:18.330 --> 03:21:23.834]  The Republicans need to know we don't give a damn about PC culture!
[03:21:24.594 --> 03:21:25.235]  We hate it!
[03:21:25.515 --> 03:21:26.696]  That's why we voted for Trump!
[03:21:28.373 --> 03:21:30.754]  But they need to know that because they still have the fear.
[03:21:30.815 --> 03:21:33.076]  They still shake in their boots at the PC World.
[03:21:35.257 --> 03:21:42.782]  And I will also say this briefly, but we need to do serious poll watching when it comes to November 6th elections, folks.
[03:21:44.123 --> 03:21:46.084]  The Democrats are going to bust people in to vote.
[03:21:46.144 --> 03:21:48.746]  They're going to be voting illegally, and we have to do poll watching.
[03:21:48.906 --> 03:21:52.268]  Now, there's certain legalities of this, but you can film
[03:21:54.089 --> 03:21:57.611]  I think it's like 200 yards or 500 yards or something from the polling place.
[03:21:58.432 --> 03:22:00.933]  You need to be filming your local polling place, folks.
[03:22:00.973 --> 03:22:12.899]  In fact, I probably plan on doing that myself when I'm not on air, because they're gonna cheat, they're gonna bus illegals in, they're gonna be busing voters around, and the only way to stop them is to catch them on film.
[03:22:13.620 --> 03:22:15.561]  So, start making plans for that.
[03:22:16.587 --> 03:22:25.430]  Now, apparently Mark Judge, Kavanaugh's friend, is going to cooperate with some investigation they're saying now, so here's the deal.
[03:22:26.810 --> 03:22:46.176]  Trump only has one option, in my opinion right now, and that's to pull the castle move, switch Kavanaugh for Cohen Barrett, then launch the FBI investigation they want, but go both sides of the aisle, go both sides of the aisle, and expose Blasey Ford for what she is.
[03:22:48.194 --> 03:22:50.536]  A total Democrat CIA operative.
[03:22:52.137 --> 03:23:06.307]  There is more evidence that proves Christine Blasey Ford is a Democrat CIA operative than, and it's not even close, than to any evidence we have that would suggest that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Blasey Ford or anyone else.
[03:23:08.548 --> 03:23:10.410]  But who gets the attack launched against them?
[03:23:10.730 --> 03:23:11.831]  Who gets their life ruined?
[03:23:12.551 --> 03:23:13.272]  Not the liar!
[03:23:13.752 --> 03:23:15.213]  Not the one with the evidence against him.
[03:23:16.114 --> 03:23:16.434]  Or her.
[03:23:16.934 --> 03:23:17.915]  No, it's Brett Kavanaugh.
[03:23:20.014 --> 03:23:20.834]  So we'll see where that goes.
[03:23:20.874 --> 03:23:22.795]  Now we've got Nicole calling in from Florida.
[03:23:23.835 --> 03:23:38.739]  Nicole says she is actually a survivor of sexual assault, to which I said the Democrats right now are destroying any woman who's actually survived sexual assault right now and now making it a boy that cried wolf scenario.
[03:23:38.799 --> 03:23:41.720]  But let's go to Nicole who's an actual survivor of this in Florida.
[03:23:42.140 --> 03:23:42.820]  Go ahead, Nicole.
[03:23:44.261 --> 03:23:44.801]  Hey, Ellen.
[03:23:44.841 --> 03:23:48.863]  First of all, thank you for what you and the rest of the crew over there at InfoWars do every day.
[03:23:48.883 --> 03:23:52.005]  I appreciate you guys, so thank you, thank you, thank you.
[03:23:52.525 --> 03:24:00.909]  I'm also engaged to an Army combat veteran, so I have a definite new view on life since getting with this guy who has completely changed my world.
[03:24:01.249 --> 03:24:09.553]  But yes, I survived childhood sexual abuse, which is even worse, because when you're six years old, that's a horrific thing to go through.
[03:24:10.109 --> 03:24:12.830]  It took me a lot of counseling and a lot of therapy.
[03:24:13.010 --> 03:24:13.630]  No drugs.
[03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:22.113]  I also live with medicine allergies, so I'm not able to take medication, which works to my benefit because I don't want to be on medication as is.
[03:24:22.733 --> 03:24:31.457]  So, with all that being said, the most important thing that I learned in my healing was that you have to take yourself out of victimhood in order to get through the world.
[03:24:31.517 --> 03:24:36.298]  You have what's called core PTSD as a result of childhood sexual trauma.
[03:24:36.698 --> 03:24:38.219]  So how this woman is working
[03:24:39.033 --> 03:24:44.456]  And license and practicing under the title of doctor blows my mind.
[03:24:44.496 --> 03:24:50.559]  What blows my mind even more as a conservative with some liberal tendencies, I can't understand the whitewashing.
[03:24:50.879 --> 03:24:52.920]  Because whitewashing is just a cover for abuse.
[03:24:53.780 --> 03:25:03.765]  So any Republican that isn't going to take that stand is doing more harm than good, not just to women, but to our party, to our movement, and to America healing.
[03:25:04.696 --> 03:25:25.048]  So, I think that this woman, at the very least, should lose her license to go to practice and quote, healing people, because keeping people stuck and the danger that this, on a national level, is providing teaching women across the board, especially young women that know state of Vicklin, is so detrimental to the development of young women that that's why I'm calling in.
[03:25:26.369 --> 03:25:30.491]  So, more people have to take a stand like, you know, Cruz and
[03:25:31.181 --> 03:25:35.484]  As a sexual assault survivor, do you think any woman that makes a claim needs to be believed?
[03:25:59.378 --> 03:26:06.801]  When they are going through some trauma, I think that doesn't say, oh, she said this happened, we're going to take it at face value.
[03:26:06.901 --> 03:26:11.503]  No, she needs to be thoroughly explored as to where is her claim and how valid is her claim.
[03:26:12.063 --> 03:26:19.106]  Is she having some sort of trauma that she's recalling, but she's now identifying falsely him?
[03:26:19.206 --> 03:26:23.568]  Because it's a very delicate, intricate thing that takes a lot of psychotherapy.
[03:26:23.628 --> 03:26:26.049]  If you have been truly through trauma, such as I have been,
[03:26:26.812 --> 03:26:28.413]  And I'll share a little bit of mine.
[03:26:28.453 --> 03:26:34.296]  Mine was through a Catholic school and I talk about like the mind bleep that went through my head at six years old.
[03:26:35.016 --> 03:26:35.916]  It took a lot of work.
[03:26:37.037 --> 03:26:39.038]  And it took a lot to do it unmedicated.
[03:26:39.638 --> 03:26:41.519]  Well then let me ask you this.
[03:26:41.599 --> 03:26:48.562]  From what you've seen, do you believe that Blasey Ford shows signs of a sexual assault victim?
[03:26:48.602 --> 03:26:50.483]  Does she seem like a sexual assault victim to you?
[03:26:51.004 --> 03:26:51.184]  No.
[03:26:51.584 --> 03:26:51.724]  No.
[03:26:51.844 --> 03:26:53.745]  She seems like so many women don't.
[03:26:54.284 --> 03:26:54.844]  Come forward.
[03:26:55.104 --> 03:27:02.166]  She seems the exact reason why most women who have been through that kind of trauma will be like, I'm not even going to go there because I don't want to be looked at.
[03:27:02.206 --> 03:27:07.768]  So you're saying because Blasey Ford is lying about these things, it makes actual victims afraid to come forward?
[03:27:08.768 --> 03:27:08.949]  Yep.
[03:27:09.569 --> 03:27:09.709]  Yep.
[03:27:09.769 --> 03:27:13.830]  Because I mean, like anybody, especially in high school, can do things that they're super for.
[03:27:14.230 --> 03:27:17.511]  You know, women tend to be like, oh, this guy attacked me.
[03:27:17.531 --> 03:27:19.592]  Well, OK, were you wearing that short skirt?
[03:27:19.612 --> 03:27:21.172]  Were you putting yourself in that situation?
[03:27:21.252 --> 03:27:23.393]  As a teenager, you're making conscious decisions.
[03:27:24.085 --> 03:27:32.552]  At six years old, when you have somebody telling you, hey, I work for God, there's a whole different level of understanding and comprehension going on in your growth and development.
[03:27:32.892 --> 03:27:51.748]  So when I hear someone who recalls, as a grown woman in her 40s, carrying a license to heal people, especially with their mind, giving false statements, giving false information, projecting to be a victim when her job says she should be doing the exact opposite, no, I don't believe a thing that's come out of her mouth.
[03:27:52.381 --> 03:27:59.384]  As a sexual assault survivor, have you ever heard or could you ever imagine a case where a woman keeps that to herself for 36 years?
[03:27:59.704 --> 03:28:02.185]  She claims she told her psychiatrist there's no evidence of that.
[03:28:02.285 --> 03:28:03.146]  It's not in the notes.
[03:28:03.506 --> 03:28:06.647]  Do you believe that that's someone keeps to herself for 36 years?
[03:28:08.868 --> 03:28:12.590]  I can say from my experience, I just keep it under my hat for a very, very long time.
[03:28:13.208 --> 03:28:18.590]  But I did seek help, it's just that the people that I sought help from didn't pull it out of me.
[03:28:18.690 --> 03:28:22.332]  So you may have not told people, but you at least told a psychiatrist or something?
[03:28:23.552 --> 03:28:25.593]  In a roundabout way, yes.
[03:28:25.653 --> 03:28:31.856]  The kids were there, I was seeking help, but I just wasn't forthright about it because there was a threat to my family.
[03:28:31.936 --> 03:28:37.798]  So for me growing up, and this is extenuating circumstances, I don't think that all people necessarily go through that.
[03:28:38.358 --> 03:28:39.879]  But again, as a teenager,
[03:28:40.600 --> 03:28:44.343]  I've been in situations where I've put myself in situations where I couldn't.
[03:28:45.084 --> 03:28:46.305]  All right, that's Nicole.
[03:28:46.705 --> 03:28:47.446]  God bless you, Nicole.
[03:28:47.466 --> 03:28:48.466]  Thank you so much for calling in.
[03:28:48.506 --> 03:28:51.209]  A sexual assault survivor weighs in on the Kavanaugh hearings.
[03:28:52.249 --> 03:29:00.236]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from Infowarsline.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.

[03:29:08.883 --> 03:29:09.984]  So, if you have a heart,

[03:29:28.633 --> 03:29:30.374]  It's one of the very best heart pills out there.
[03:29:30.695 --> 03:29:31.475]  It's Xtend-A-Wise.
[03:29:31.675 --> 03:29:34.398]  So, get some for yourself and family and friends.
[03:29:34.778 --> 03:29:37.840]  It's got the very best fish oil from the Fjords.
[03:29:37.860 --> 03:29:43.224]  It's very, very pure, very, very clean and has the EPA type that is specifically good for the heart, cardiovascular system.
[03:29:43.905 --> 03:29:47.408]  It's got the properly formulated type of CoQ10 and more.
[03:29:47.728 --> 03:29:49.309]  It is Xtend-A-Wise.
[03:29:49.349 --> 03:29:51.511]  Now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:29:52.251 --> 03:30:00.281]  One of the most amazing products that I've seen in years is Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse, available at InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:30:00.722 --> 03:30:05.648]  Now, I've got some bags under my eyes, especially right now with really bad allergies in Austin, Texas.
[03:30:06.069 --> 03:30:09.253]  Mold's been at like 1,400 or something, as high as it ever gets.
[03:30:09.533 --> 03:30:10.414]  That makes me get puffy.
[03:30:11.636 --> 03:30:24.086]  But if I use just one little container of Ageless, and I can share it with both eyes, within three minutes you'll see dramatic results, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:30:24.106 --> 03:30:28.210]  Because I've got some bad bags with allergies, plus I work 15, 16 hours a day.
[03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:31.392]  Everybody knows fighting the globalists is a stressful job.
[03:30:31.793 --> 03:30:32.954]  So, again, just twist it off.
[03:30:34.938 --> 03:30:37.959]  Even, you know, a dummy like me can put it under.
[03:30:38.820 --> 03:30:44.842]  I'm not a big metrosexual guy, you know, that worries about my wrinkles, worries about things like that.
[03:30:44.862 --> 03:30:52.426]  But when it comes to having bags under your eyes, being on television or just, you know, anybody in regular life, it's something good to do.
[03:30:53.026 --> 03:30:55.607]  And again, a lot of folks use one per eye.
[03:30:56.948 --> 03:30:59.549]  I have found that the other times I've used it,
[03:31:02.580 --> 03:31:04.741]  I don't even need to use an entire container.
[03:31:05.242 --> 03:31:05.722]  So there you go.
[03:31:05.822 --> 03:31:07.783]  I'm not a cosmetic person.
[03:31:07.903 --> 03:31:10.905]  I'm not an expert on skin, any of that stuff.
[03:31:11.286 --> 03:31:14.828]  All I know is, over the years, I've tried some other products that haven't done anything.
[03:31:14.848 --> 03:31:16.389]  Ageless has a massive effect.
[03:31:16.889 --> 03:31:21.312]  So you get a great product for yourself, for your wife, for your boyfriend, for your girlfriend.
[03:31:21.332 --> 03:31:22.613]  It's good for men and women.
[03:31:23.313 --> 03:31:27.276]  And you fund the InfoWars at InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:31:27.316 --> 03:31:30.178]  So let's see what happens in the next, I guess, two and a half minutes now.
[03:31:31.571 --> 03:31:32.413]  I'm a human being.
[03:31:32.533 --> 03:31:33.315]  I have dignity.
[03:31:33.596 --> 03:31:34.317]  I'm gonna resist.
[03:31:34.337 --> 03:31:36.542]  I'm gonna start recognizing the propaganda.
[03:31:36.562 --> 03:31:38.125]  I'm gonna break free from it.
[03:31:38.145 --> 03:31:39.548]  Humanity's gonna come together.
[03:31:49.986 --> 03:31:50.626]  So there you go.
[03:31:51.467 --> 03:31:53.188]  I just applied that kind of like a monkey would.
[03:31:53.208 --> 03:31:55.910]  I'm not as good as a woman or somebody that's good at this stuff.
[03:31:56.430 --> 03:31:57.591]  And I can already feel it tightening.
[03:31:57.631 --> 03:31:58.712]  It already feels good.
[03:31:59.052 --> 03:31:59.653]  Feels cool.
[03:32:00.593 --> 03:32:01.834]  It's pretty much dry now.
[03:32:01.914 --> 03:32:03.835]  I'm going to go back and look at the time lapse.
[03:32:04.496 --> 03:32:05.256]  It's pretty dramatic.
[03:32:05.677 --> 03:32:06.657]  At least the past one I've done it.
[03:32:06.697 --> 03:32:07.418]  We'll see what happens here.
[03:32:08.178 --> 03:32:17.723]  It is instantly ageless, along with some other amazing products as well for the skin, supplements, energy, it's all amazing, cutting edge, at InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:32:18.264 --> 03:32:30.891]  When you get the Jeunesse products there, you get big discounts, there's a lot of different specials, you can also sign up to be a distributor, and that helps fund the war against the globalists and help us continue to try to make America and the planet successful, capitalist, and free again.
[03:32:31.571 --> 03:32:32.412]  Wars are expensive.
[03:32:32.452 --> 03:32:33.172]  We're fighting one.
[03:32:33.473 --> 03:32:33.993]  We're winning.
[03:32:34.113 --> 03:32:34.994]  Thanks for your support.
[03:32:35.294 --> 03:32:37.536]  We try to bring you great products to make it easy to support us.
[03:32:37.816 --> 03:32:39.037]  And this one is a big winner.
[03:32:39.497 --> 03:32:42.840]  Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse at InfoWarsYes.com.

[03:32:49.365 --> 03:32:51.607]  Only at InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:32:55.850 --> 03:32:58.492]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.730 --> 03:33:18.751]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:33:18.991 --> 03:33:21.953]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.333 --> 03:33:25.395]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:33:27.856 --> 03:33:39.143]  You know, I don't want to play games about politics or, you know, who says what or does what.
[03:33:43.222 --> 03:33:44.503]  I'm just for what's right.
[03:33:44.803 --> 03:33:46.244]  I'm just for what's logical.
[03:33:46.645 --> 03:33:47.765]  I'm for what's reasonable.
[03:33:49.046 --> 03:33:53.429]  And even if I... In fact, I didn't want Kavanaugh.
[03:33:53.489 --> 03:33:54.470]  I wanted Cohen Barrett.
[03:33:54.910 --> 03:33:57.932]  I was never a supporter of Kavanaugh.
[03:33:58.012 --> 03:34:05.177]  But I'm not going to sit here just because I didn't want Kavanaugh and say, yes, let's let the Democrats destroy Kavanaugh.
[03:34:05.497 --> 03:34:09.220]  Let's let the Democrats destroy the Supreme Court, you know, justice system.
[03:34:12.631 --> 03:34:13.952]  No, I'm going to say this is wrong.
[03:34:15.252 --> 03:34:16.413]  This is an abomination.
[03:34:21.736 --> 03:34:32.401]  But if the Democrats get away with this, folks, they will just become more and more unhinged and realize that no one's going to check them.
[03:34:34.062 --> 03:34:36.403]  We're taking your calls in response to the Kavanaugh hearing.
[03:34:36.923 --> 03:34:38.944]  We've got Angel calling in from Alaska.
[03:34:39.545 --> 03:34:40.185]  Go ahead, Angel.
[03:34:41.506 --> 03:34:41.826]  Hey.
[03:34:42.819 --> 03:34:44.219]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:34:44.299 --> 03:34:54.562]  This whole experience really just wants me to get out there, call Lisa Murkowski, call Lindsey Graham, you know, write to President Trump about all of what's going on.
[03:34:55.442 --> 03:34:56.162]  It's ridiculous.
[03:34:57.082 --> 03:34:59.263]  I'm just curious, are you a mother by any chance?
[03:35:00.323 --> 03:35:02.684]  No, I'm a college-age female.
[03:35:04.145 --> 03:35:07.488]  Which, it makes it hard to have friends standing up for the truth.
[03:35:07.508 --> 03:35:08.548]  Well, let me ask you this then.
[03:35:08.889 --> 03:35:13.372]  As somebody that's in college, I was in college, gee, I don't know, that's ten years ago.
[03:35:15.984 --> 03:35:27.191]  You know, there was a little bit of, there wasn't like the concern that, you know, if you go with a girl or something and you're drunk or, you know, whatever happens, that there'll be some charge or anything against you.
[03:35:27.211 --> 03:35:33.854]  So there wasn't really like, I mean, there was that understanding, at least on my behalf and in my general group of friends.
[03:35:34.395 --> 03:35:37.697]  Hey, look, you know, if a girl's too drunk, you watch out for her and, you know, you don't
[03:35:38.297 --> 03:35:39.798]  You know, you don't take advantage of that.
[03:35:39.818 --> 03:35:40.798]  You will get called out.
[03:35:42.199 --> 03:35:44.680]  That was my experience for the most part in college.
[03:35:44.720 --> 03:35:50.823]  I'm not saying my experience is the same as everyone's, but I hung out with a lot of friends in high school, a lot of friends in college.
[03:35:50.943 --> 03:35:55.445]  I mean, I went to pretty much all the different groups, all the different parties, and it was pretty much the same.
[03:35:55.505 --> 03:35:56.166]  Like, okay, yeah.
[03:35:57.062 --> 03:36:08.391]  We recognize, like, hey, you gotta be careful, and you don't take advantage of drunk girls, you don't, you know, fall into bed with one, you know, and if you did, you'd get called out, you may even get your ass kicked.
[03:36:08.891 --> 03:36:17.218]  So, but now, I feel like, and this is what I'm asking you, is there a new level of this now where a guy, like, doesn't even want to approach a woman?
[03:36:17.578 --> 03:36:23.323]  Like, it's almost like a state officer's like, I don't even want to talk to a girl because I could have an accusation against me.
[03:36:24.281 --> 03:36:30.585]  Yeah, there's actually this thing in the university you have to fill out before you're accepted as a student that's called, like, Title IX.
[03:36:30.665 --> 03:36:32.427]  It's all about sexual assault.
[03:36:32.487 --> 03:36:37.290]  And some of these, it goes through questions of, like, you know, who was the victim?
[03:36:37.370 --> 03:36:39.572]  And does this need to be reported?
[03:36:39.672 --> 03:36:41.273]  And some of it's just ridiculous.
[03:36:43.066 --> 03:36:48.207]  Well, and it's this whole thing of just common sense and logic and reasoning being out the door.
[03:36:48.707 --> 03:36:52.888]  It's like, oh, we can find a way to legislate everything.
[03:36:53.168 --> 03:36:56.669]  No, common sense and justice is on its face.
[03:36:57.049 --> 03:36:57.629]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:36:57.649 --> 03:36:58.789]  Mm-hmm.
[03:37:00.990 --> 03:37:03.670]  So what do you think comes next at the university level?
[03:37:03.930 --> 03:37:07.611]  Are women saying, oh my gosh, we're all victims, look at what's happening to us?
[03:37:07.751 --> 03:37:12.012]  Or are women saying, oh my gosh, I can't believe they're making us out to be victims like this?
[03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:19.242]  Honestly, I think most women just love to embrace their victimhood because it gives them special privileges.
[03:37:21.843 --> 03:37:25.265]  You know, it's really pathetic to me that this is what they've done to people in this country.
[03:37:25.285 --> 03:37:30.147]  It's not just women, but for this example, they have all of these women now that think they're victims.
[03:37:31.327 --> 03:37:35.229]  And when you enter that mindset of being a victim, you can't do anything.
[03:37:35.429 --> 03:37:36.729]  You're handicapped.
[03:37:36.789 --> 03:37:37.910]  You're handcuffed.
[03:37:37.970 --> 03:37:39.250]  And that's what they've done to these people.
[03:37:39.390 --> 03:37:40.471]  And that's why they need the government.
[03:37:41.343 --> 03:37:42.544]  Thank you so much for the call, Angel.
[03:37:42.604 --> 03:37:43.144]  You know what, guys?
[03:37:43.164 --> 03:37:45.446]  I actually want to go... Let's actually go to Erica here.
[03:37:45.466 --> 03:37:46.967]  I want to try to find a mother.
[03:37:46.987 --> 03:37:49.248]  I want to ask a mother a question here.
[03:37:49.288 --> 03:37:50.529]  Let's see if Erica's a mother here.
[03:37:50.549 --> 03:37:51.810]  Let's go to Erica in California.
[03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:55.232]  Erica, if you're not your mother, it's okay, but I'm just taking female calls right now.
[03:37:55.652 --> 03:37:56.333]  Are you a mother?
[03:37:56.973 --> 03:37:57.493]  Hi, Owen.
[03:37:57.533 --> 03:38:01.036]  No, I'm not a mother, but I am a sister, and I do have a father.
[03:38:01.056 --> 03:38:02.637]  But let me ask you this.
[03:38:02.657 --> 03:38:03.557]  Do you have any brothers?
[03:38:04.518 --> 03:38:05.859]  I have brother-in-law, yes.
[03:38:06.519 --> 03:38:09.201]  Now, how would you feel if some woman
[03:38:10.427 --> 03:38:11.650]  And you know your brother-in-law well.
[03:38:11.790 --> 03:38:13.433]  Good people, you know that they wouldn't do anything.
[03:38:13.613 --> 03:38:18.323]  But some woman wanted to destroy his life and made false allegations against him.
[03:38:18.804 --> 03:38:19.786]  How would you feel about that?
[03:38:20.595 --> 03:38:24.098]  Well let me tell you this much, my brother-in-law is a chiropractor, okay?
[03:38:24.118 --> 03:38:26.379]  So he's already touching people, that's his job.
[03:38:27.040 --> 03:38:34.885]  I had an explicit conversation with him the other day telling him, you need cameras in every single one of your offices, because guess what?
[03:38:35.346 --> 03:38:40.510]  You are a white male, you have a great education, you are a target.
[03:38:41.130 --> 03:38:45.133]  And I apologize for my tone again, but Owen, I am incensed
[03:38:45.885 --> 03:38:47.206]  By what the Democrats have done.
[03:38:47.547 --> 03:38:55.113]  And anyone who is a wife, has a husband, has a father, has a son, has a brother should be up in arms over this.
[03:38:55.534 --> 03:39:00.558]  What the Democrats are doing is despicable and it's rooted in evil.
[03:39:00.858 --> 03:39:04.602]  And what is going on is just... I'm beside myself over this.
[03:39:04.682 --> 03:39:05.643]  What happened yesterday?
[03:39:05.803 --> 03:39:07.464]  I mean, I watched the whole thing.
[03:39:07.484 --> 03:39:08.645]  I even stayed home from school.
[03:39:08.665 --> 03:39:09.326]  I watched the whole thing.
[03:39:09.386 --> 03:39:10.007]  I was just so...
[03:39:11.204 --> 03:39:16.328]  I was shocked by what I was seeing in America happen.
[03:39:16.368 --> 03:39:18.610]  I think most Americans are just like you, but isn't it sad?
[03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:24.695]  See, this is what they, eventually they had to do this in Russia and other countries because so many people were faking insurance claims.
[03:39:24.715 --> 03:39:27.357]  They'd act like you hit them with their car or something like that.
[03:39:27.657 --> 03:39:31.380]  So people had to install dash cams just to avoid that from happening.
[03:39:31.660 --> 03:39:39.987]  Now it's like you have to install a camera or wear a body cam around just to make sure some woman doesn't, you know, make some sex assault allegation against you to try to destroy your life.
[03:39:40.879 --> 03:39:48.947]  I hope you're the first one to put a body cam on because as of yesterday, every man should be wearing a body cam at all times.
[03:39:49.067 --> 03:39:51.790]  That's how despicable what happened yesterday.
[03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:55.353]  They have no idea the ramifications that they've done for what they did yesterday.
[03:39:55.393 --> 03:39:59.277]  And I tell you what, as a woman, that woman is lying.
[03:40:00.146 --> 03:40:06.089]  A double master's in psychology and a PhD, you don't think she knows how to trick a stupid liar?
[03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:07.550]  Oh, she's totally lying.
[03:40:07.570 --> 03:40:12.712]  You know, this is a problem that, it's not a problem, it's a problem in the PC woos culture we live in.
[03:40:13.253 --> 03:40:20.596]  We go with our gut instinct because we know our gut instinct is right because we've gone with it and 99.9% of the time it's right.
[03:40:20.616 --> 03:40:24.058]  So my gut looks at Blasey Ford and says, that's a liar.
[03:40:25.128 --> 03:40:33.577]  It's despicable, lying, ruining it for the women who actually have had sexual assault posed against them.
[03:40:33.617 --> 03:40:35.039]  This is just what happened yesterday.
[03:40:35.059 --> 03:40:35.719]  It's despicable.
[03:40:35.960 --> 03:40:38.062]  I am so concerned for my country.
[03:40:38.643 --> 03:40:40.905]  Like I said, I live here in disgusting California.
[03:40:41.165 --> 03:40:47.032]  What they are teaching in the schools, you don't even touch on what they actually are teaching in the schools.
[03:40:47.640 --> 03:40:49.282]  Oh, it's Chinese propaganda.
[03:40:49.482 --> 03:40:51.004]  They're teaching incest.
[03:40:51.144 --> 03:40:56.611]  They're telling the kids, I say kids, I'm one of them, have sex with your brother and sister.
[03:40:56.711 --> 03:40:59.434]  Oh my gosh, and pedophilia too.
[03:41:00.536 --> 03:41:01.437]  It's so sick.
[03:41:01.657 --> 03:41:05.462]  You know what, I'm sorry to the callers that have been holding, I gotta do this though.
[03:41:05.882 --> 03:41:09.365]  I'm sorry to Gary, I'm sorry to Sam, I'm sorry to Tim and all you guys you've been holding.
[03:41:09.625 --> 03:41:10.246]  I'm sorry guys.
[03:41:10.446 --> 03:41:10.966]  I gotta do this.
[03:41:11.387 --> 03:41:12.147]  Clear the lines.
[03:41:12.688 --> 03:41:13.328]  Clear the lines.
[03:41:13.468 --> 03:41:19.493]  I only wanna, I wanna take calls specifically from mothers of boys in high school.
[03:41:19.733 --> 03:41:21.095]  Specifically, I'm sorry guys.
[03:41:21.195 --> 03:41:21.575]  I love you.
[03:41:21.595 --> 03:41:22.296]  I'm sorry to do this.
[03:41:22.416 --> 03:41:23.076]  People have been waiting.
[03:41:23.136 --> 03:41:23.617]  You're the best.
[03:41:23.877 --> 03:41:24.297]  I'm sorry.
[03:41:25.738 --> 03:41:27.039]  Specifically, clear the lines.
[03:41:27.220 --> 03:41:32.104]  I wanna hear from mothers that have a boy either in college or high school right now.
[03:41:32.524 --> 03:41:33.745]  And I wanna get your take on this.
[03:41:33.825 --> 03:41:34.586]  Now, I gotta say this.
[03:41:35.888 --> 03:41:39.469]  I've been a public figure pretty much since I was about 18.
[03:41:39.849 --> 03:41:47.632]  I'm not saying I was a celebrity or anything, but I mean I've been going to public events, going to places where people can say, yeah, he was there that night, I can recount.
[03:41:48.052 --> 03:41:54.774]  And I also have basically calendars, kind of like Kavanaugh has, from I would say 75% of my life activity for the last
[03:41:58.704 --> 03:41:59.665]  Four or five years.
[03:41:59.945 --> 03:42:12.334]  So now it's like, now you have a new reason to have calendars and document everything, so in case someone wants to file some fake sex charge against you, you can actually back up your defense here, because now you're guilty until proven Democrat.
[03:42:13.115 --> 03:42:13.855]  Did you hear what I said?
[03:42:14.816 --> 03:42:15.577]  No, I don't think you heard me.
[03:42:15.817 --> 03:42:18.599]  You're guilty until proven Democrat.
[03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:23.770]  So, when we come back, we got one segment left of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:24.671 --> 03:42:26.471]  I'm going to these phone calls.
[03:42:26.931 --> 03:42:30.132]  I want to hear from mothers that have boys in high school and college.
[03:42:30.172 --> 03:42:31.032]  See what they think about this.
[03:42:31.512 --> 03:42:32.812]  Infowarsstore.com, folks.
[03:42:32.952 --> 03:42:34.172]  I barely even plugged today.
[03:42:34.232 --> 03:42:35.332]  I should have plugged every segment.
[03:42:35.392 --> 03:42:35.773]  I blew it.
[03:42:36.193 --> 03:42:37.633]  Please, pick up the slack for me.
[03:42:37.913 --> 03:42:39.313]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:42:39.573 --> 03:42:41.633]  Tell your friends and family about Infowarsstore.com.
[03:42:41.834 --> 03:42:45.474]  Survival Shield X2 is on its last run, and it's 25% off.
[03:42:45.774 --> 03:42:46.914]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:42:46.954 --> 03:42:47.875]  Tell your friends and family.
[03:42:47.895 --> 03:42:48.715]  Support the Infowars.
[03:42:48.735 --> 03:42:50.115]  We're the only people that tell it like it is.
[03:42:51.741 --> 03:42:53.423]  So I've been talking about this for a long time.
[03:42:55.765 --> 03:42:56.305]  But now it's here.
[03:42:56.586 --> 03:42:59.308]  This is the last run of X2, our best-selling product.
[03:42:59.889 --> 03:43:02.491]  It's proprietary to the purest iodine out there on the open market.
[03:43:03.492 --> 03:43:06.775]  And we have had big trouble getting it, and the price has gone way up.
[03:43:06.875 --> 03:43:07.936]  So the contract's broken.
[03:43:08.276 --> 03:43:09.177]  This is the end of X2.
[03:43:10.618 --> 03:43:14.602]  Now, I've had 25% off for a few weeks, and I've just been so busy, I haven't done new specials.
[03:43:14.662 --> 03:43:16.043]  But I'm putting my foot down.
[03:43:17.029 --> 03:43:21.170]  As of next Monday, in just two days, the 25% off on X2 ends.
[03:43:21.210 --> 03:43:26.432]  And then it's going to go to full price, which is still a good deal, until we've sold out of it.
[03:43:26.512 --> 03:43:31.234]  And I hope to get some type of replacement or something as good or better by then, but things don't look too hopeful.
[03:43:32.799 --> 03:43:33.840]  Best of times, worst of times.
[03:43:33.900 --> 03:43:34.761]  It's a great product.
[03:43:34.961 --> 03:43:36.482]  You really need to experience it.
[03:43:36.502 --> 03:43:37.743]  If you haven't, this is your chance.

[03:43:39.945 --> 03:43:41.987]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:43:42.487 --> 03:43:43.888]  Get your X2 while you still can.

[03:45:30.797 --> 03:45:33.079]  Just a happier, younger-looking you.
[03:45:34.261 --> 03:45:36.323]  To use, simply massage the packet.
[03:45:37.264 --> 03:45:40.727]  Dispense a small drop and lightly pat a thin layer to targeted areas.
[03:45:41.801 --> 03:45:46.084]  Leave the product damp on your skin and remain expressionless for two minutes while it dries.
[03:45:46.864 --> 03:45:49.326]  And if you missed a spot, it's easy to reapply.
[03:45:49.826 --> 03:45:54.249]  Or if you happen to apply too much, wet a cotton swab and gently remove any residue.
[03:45:54.889 --> 03:45:57.971]  Apply oil-free cosmetics and finish getting ready as usual.
[03:45:58.431 --> 03:45:59.272]  It's that simple.
[03:45:59.732 --> 03:46:08.718]  I've probably noticed in the past five years that my eyes have gained a lot of fine lines, wrinkles, my curls have gotten deeper.
[03:46:12.316 --> 03:46:12.576]  Wow.
[03:46:12.756 --> 03:46:15.758]  I was hoping for five years, but that's like what my eyes looked like ten years ago.
[03:46:16.839 --> 03:46:18.500]  That is really cool!
[03:46:19.380 --> 03:46:19.760]  Wrinkle?
[03:46:20.381 --> 03:46:20.701]  Gone?
[03:46:22.142 --> 03:46:22.522]  It's easy.
[03:46:22.542 --> 03:46:24.323]  You just put it on your finger and go.
[03:46:24.383 --> 03:46:26.885]  Now I wish I had more down here because I can still see one wrinkle.
[03:46:26.925 --> 03:46:27.485]  It's bugging me.
[03:46:28.465 --> 03:46:29.726]  I am a little bit emotional.
[03:46:30.287 --> 03:46:41.053]  Turning 40 I didn't think would be a big deal to me, but that looks like the me that I feel like inside instead of what I see when I look in the mirror.
[03:46:55.707 --> 03:46:58.343]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.344 --> 03:47:13.107]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:47:13.407 --> 03:47:17.670]  Today and now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:20.972]  Don Salazar has the story at Infowars.com.
[03:47:21.192 --> 03:47:21.792]  Backfire.
[03:47:21.832 --> 03:47:24.754]  Democrats walk away in droves following Kavanaugh Circus.
[03:47:24.814 --> 03:47:29.698]  The walk away march is October, the weekend of October 27th in D.C.
[03:47:29.858 --> 03:47:31.899]  It's a literal walk away from the Democrat Party.
[03:47:31.939 --> 03:47:36.162]  I think the Democrats, but here's the thing, they don't really care if they lose all their voter base.
[03:47:36.442 --> 03:47:37.843]  They have to stop
[03:47:38.143 --> 03:47:38.283]  I don't
[03:48:01.095 --> 03:48:02.675]  Supreme Court Kavanaugh confirmed.
[03:48:03.036 --> 03:48:06.457]  I'm not convinced of that, but that's the grumblings coming out of D.C.
[03:48:06.497 --> 03:48:17.420]  Now, I am going to phone calls now from mothers of young boys in high school and college to see what they think about this and the dangers that could loom on the other side.
[03:48:17.780 --> 03:48:20.881]  Let's go to Susan in Indiana, a mother.
[03:48:21.801 --> 03:48:22.921]  Susan, how old are your boys?
[03:48:24.822 --> 03:48:25.762]  Let's say they're like 34, 35, 36.
[03:48:28.752 --> 03:48:40.281]  Now let's say your boys were at a high school party 15 years ago and there was some some beers and you know all of a sudden a girl had a vendetta against them and decided to come forward this and try to destroy their life.
[03:48:40.301 --> 03:48:41.282]  Does that worry you now?
[03:48:44.244 --> 03:48:58.355]  I got past those years but well yeah I mean I think the whole thing I mean this woman is such an incredibly poor actor you know there's a whiny voice you need to clear her throat and you know
[03:48:59.324 --> 03:49:06.629]  I mean, when you're talking about something that happened to you so many years ago, if it did happen, you can talk about it, you know?
[03:49:06.669 --> 03:49:10.471]  You don't have to put on that little whiny voice.
[03:49:11.532 --> 03:49:16.034]  Well, you know what they say, believe in something even if you can't remember anything.
[03:49:17.135 --> 03:49:24.680]  Well, if she was so devastated by this, as she acts right now, how did she get her PhD and become a college professor?
[03:49:27.281 --> 03:49:29.643]  Her story has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.
[03:49:29.783 --> 03:49:30.624]  It's ridiculous.
[03:49:30.664 --> 03:49:31.804]  Susan, thank you so much for the call.
[03:49:31.824 --> 03:49:35.487]  Let's go to Jacqueline in Ohio, a mother who also has two younger brothers.
[03:49:35.887 --> 03:49:45.334]  Jacqueline, do you fear for your younger brothers and your sons that they could have some woman with a vendetta against them to try to destroy their life with false accusations?
[03:49:46.775 --> 03:49:47.736]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:49:47.776 --> 03:49:48.837]  Yeah, I do actually.
[03:49:48.957 --> 03:49:51.819]  An incident actually happened to my brother who is now
[03:49:52.851 --> 03:50:10.565]  25 this past year some girl said that he did some things to her or whatever and then she started like writing letters to my parents Showing up on their doorstep like harassing them saying that he did something that he didn't So it's already happening happened to someone in my family.
[03:50:10.585 --> 03:50:18.831]  It was kind of scary Yeah, and and you know I don't know if this is something everyone's experienced and I
[03:50:20.561 --> 03:50:22.763]  I haven't experienced this personally to this level.
[03:50:23.264 --> 03:50:33.933]  I've had friends that have experienced this and I didn't want to get into it because I don't even want to go down that road and even have people from my past drumming it up and being like, oh look what Owen's talking about.
[03:50:33.953 --> 03:50:38.017]  But yeah, it happens and it destroys people's lives.
[03:50:39.118 --> 03:50:39.398]  It does.
[03:50:39.698 --> 03:50:44.723]  And I actually had something else that I wanted to talk to you about because no one else has actually even brought this up anywhere.
[03:50:47.802 --> 03:51:00.971]  When Blasey Ford was talking and Mitchell was asking her about how she met Kavanaugh, she said it was through this guy that she wouldn't name, and he was potentially at that gathering.
[03:51:01.492 --> 03:51:07.596]  And this guy, they said, kind of looked like Kavanaugh, but she still didn't want to say who this guy was, right?
[03:51:07.696 --> 03:51:15.622]  And then when she's been there asked about the relationship between her and the guy, she said, we were quote-unquote going out for a few months, and then
[03:51:16.178 --> 03:51:20.962]  Mitchell asked, well, what was your relationship like before and after the incident?
[03:51:21.462 --> 03:51:26.647]  And then, and she was like, well, you know, we were going out before and after they just stopped going out.
[03:51:26.907 --> 03:51:43.080]  So you have this other guy who no one knows who it is, potentially looks like Kavanaugh, you know, and with her going to therapy and being a psychologist, like there are things that you can do like hypnotherapy and such to retrieve suppressed memories.
[03:51:43.607 --> 03:51:48.088]  About incidents, but also different memories can be implanted as well.
[03:51:48.568 --> 03:51:50.289]  So it's just crazy.
[03:51:50.489 --> 03:51:54.730]  But let's take one more step with this, and this is going to anger a lot of people, but I'm sorry, it's real.
[03:51:55.490 --> 03:52:12.054]  What about the case and the situation that happens where a girl, let's say, does get drunk or inebriated and ends up with a guy and then regrets it the next day, and because of that regret and the shame she feels, tries to put the blame on the guy and say that she was assaulted.
[03:52:12.094 --> 03:52:13.034]  How about that situation?
[03:52:14.437 --> 03:52:17.423]  Yeah, I mean, nowadays I'm sure that's happening all the time.
[03:52:17.483 --> 03:52:18.525]  I fear for my son.
[03:52:18.545 --> 03:52:19.948]  My son's not even three yet.
[03:52:20.709 --> 03:52:22.853]  Oh my, it's going to be even harder for him.
[03:52:23.880 --> 03:52:30.202]  Oh yeah, and you know, he's a white male, so I'm going to be afraid for him forever.
[03:52:30.242 --> 03:52:34.383]  I mean, I have family members that are extremely liberal saying, oh, white men are bad.
[03:52:34.423 --> 03:52:35.124]  I'm like, dude.
[03:52:35.264 --> 03:52:35.764]  Oh boy.
[03:52:36.104 --> 03:52:37.024]  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[03:52:37.084 --> 03:52:38.125]  Jacqueline, God bless you.
[03:52:38.145 --> 03:52:38.645]  Thank you for your call.
[03:52:38.665 --> 03:52:39.825]  I've got to hop to another caller.
[03:52:40.105 --> 03:52:42.966]  Let's go to Shannon in California, also a mother.
[03:52:43.046 --> 03:52:44.167]  Shannon, how old are your boys?
[03:52:46.062 --> 03:52:47.543]  I have two sons.
[03:52:47.903 --> 03:52:51.326]  First of all, it's an honor to speak with you live, and I'm a huge supporter of InfoWars.
[03:52:51.366 --> 03:52:54.168]  There are some of us that actually have our heads on straight in California.
[03:52:55.809 --> 03:52:57.110]  But I have two sons.
[03:52:57.190 --> 03:53:01.553]  I have a 22-year-old who's actually in the Marines, and I have an 18-year-old son.
[03:53:01.713 --> 03:53:03.455]  Both of their eyes are wide open.
[03:53:05.196 --> 03:53:11.260]  And they, you know, thank God, my 18-year-old couldn't wait to get registered to vote.
[03:53:11.521 --> 03:53:14.683]  But it is just so scary what's going on.
[03:53:15.633 --> 03:53:25.559]  And watching Kavanaugh yesterday, I mean you can just see the truthfulness and his sincerity juxtaposed with Christine's lies and deceitfulness.
[03:53:25.779 --> 03:53:27.420]  It's abundantly clear.
[03:53:27.660 --> 03:53:40.967]  What do you think about what's happening right now though with this power, this unlimited power they want to give to women to say you can just make an allegation against a man and you have to be believed and we will destroy that man's life.
[03:53:40.987 --> 03:53:42.468]  Does that make you afraid for your sons?
[03:53:43.405 --> 03:53:53.072]  It makes me afraid for my sons, and to be honest, it makes me embarrassed that they are making women look like that.
[03:53:53.432 --> 03:54:00.457]  It makes me actually embarrassed to say that that's what women, so many, are coming to.
[03:54:01.238 --> 03:54:02.338]  But absolutely.
[03:54:02.418 --> 03:54:07.942]  And I just try to teach my sons, in this day and age, to just keep their heads on straight.
[03:54:08.543 --> 03:54:12.466]  And thankfully, we're done with the high school years.
[03:54:13.579 --> 03:54:13.819]  I think so.
[03:54:33.447 --> 03:54:38.733]  But my daughter kind of, I know she's unfortunately been kind of indoctrinated by that.
[03:54:39.514 --> 03:54:40.916]  Exactly, because here's what they're doing.
[03:54:40.956 --> 03:54:44.319]  They're trying to destroy men and women having normal relationships.
[03:54:44.360 --> 03:54:50.527]  I mean, look, I'm not sitting here saying that, you know, you know, males need to go out and just have, you know, conquer any woman, you know.
[03:54:50.567 --> 03:54:51.287]  No, no.
[03:54:51.368 --> 03:54:53.930]  I'm saying, though, it's reaching a point where
[03:54:55.518 --> 03:54:59.400]  I mean, and let's take a look at the entire scope of things.
[03:54:59.980 --> 03:55:01.920]  What's coming up right now as an industry?
[03:55:02.141 --> 03:55:02.841]  Sex dolls.
[03:55:03.541 --> 03:55:03.781]  Okay?
[03:55:04.101 --> 03:55:09.543]  So now you're looking at a situation where an individual might say, look, I don't want to go anywhere near a woman.
[03:55:10.083 --> 03:55:14.425]  I don't even want to think about going near a woman because I don't know that could have a negative impact on my future life.
[03:55:14.445 --> 03:55:16.826]  So now men don't engage with women.
[03:55:17.106 --> 03:55:21.627]  They don't go out and try to, you know, pick up women or flirt with women at the bar, which is what most women want.
[03:55:21.667 --> 03:55:23.328]  They're like dying for an alpha male.
[03:55:23.848 --> 03:55:31.550]  Now the men are so scared, but now the men are so scared so they won't approach the woman because, you know, 36 years you might be a rapist, and so then what do they do?
[03:55:31.590 --> 03:55:35.271]  They go masturbate to porn, or they go buy a sex doll.
[03:55:36.271 --> 03:55:44.213]  You know, it's sick, and I'm a single mom, by the way, and I absolutely, I am like, are there any alpha males left out there?
[03:55:45.973 --> 03:55:48.874]  I am a toxic masculinist and I'm not afraid to admit it!
[03:55:49.374 --> 03:55:51.455]  Screw you, if you don't like men!
[03:55:51.695 --> 03:55:52.355]  Screw you!
[03:55:53.964 --> 03:55:55.005]  Thank you so much, Shannon.
[03:55:55.025 --> 03:55:57.567]  I want to take one more call from Dee in Oregon.
[03:55:57.587 --> 03:55:59.168]  Dee, how old are your sons?
[03:56:01.069 --> 03:56:04.071]  My sons are 13 and 7.
[03:56:06.173 --> 03:56:16.160]  We pulled up my 13 year old out of public school and put him into a charter military school because of the indoctrination.
[03:56:16.914 --> 03:56:18.415]  Couple things I want to point out, though.
[03:56:18.475 --> 03:56:20.495]  First, awesome speaking with you, Owen.
[03:56:20.615 --> 03:56:22.916]  Just so you know, I listen to The War Room every day.
[03:56:22.936 --> 03:56:24.237]  You and Rogers rock.
[03:56:26.077 --> 03:56:36.361]  And I truly believe after listening and watching that whole entire thing yesterday, I really believe she is lying.
[03:56:36.821 --> 03:56:38.082]  I believe she is lying.
[03:56:38.202 --> 03:56:41.623]  I believe there is just too much of very vagueness
[03:56:43.676 --> 03:56:47.779]  You're absolutely right, Dee.
[03:56:47.819 --> 03:56:51.561]  It's so obvious, and I think the average American sees this, and we're reaching a turning point.
[03:56:51.581 --> 03:56:52.082]  But here's the thing.
[03:56:52.122 --> 03:56:53.723]  We cannot be afraid of our shadow.
[03:56:54.163 --> 03:56:56.024]  We cannot be afraid of political correctness.
[03:56:56.324 --> 03:57:00.467]  And we have to stand up for truth and justice and common sense.
[03:57:00.727 --> 03:57:06.351]  We cannot be cowards to be afraid that an allegation is going to be made because we're not PC.
[03:57:06.911 --> 03:57:07.892]  And that's the big thing.
[03:57:08.553 --> 03:57:10.033]  And we have to stick to our guns on this.
[03:57:11.081 --> 03:57:21.376]  And honestly, the only way to save America is for real Americans, alpha men, alpha women, to buck this system and say, I'm not going to be afraid of the PC culture.
[03:57:21.817 --> 03:57:22.998]  I'm not going to be afraid of...
[03:57:25.169 --> 03:57:27.391]  Democrats trying to separate men from women.
[03:57:27.451 --> 03:57:27.811]  No, no, no.
[03:57:27.851 --> 03:57:30.634]  We're going to come together and actually build a nation.
[03:57:30.954 --> 03:57:31.935]  That's how you build a nation.
[03:57:31.955 --> 03:57:33.256]  Alright, that does it for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:33.316 --> 03:57:38.020]  I'm jumping over to the War Room to go live for the next three hours at Infowars.com slash show.
[03:57:38.341 --> 03:57:40.342]  So I will see you in 60 seconds.
[03:57:42.270 --> 03:57:47.333]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[03:57:47.453 --> 03:57:52.336]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver.
[03:57:52.396 --> 03:57:55.739]  That is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[03:57:55.799 --> 03:58:04.544]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked for first-aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and secondary burns, skin irritations.
[03:58:04.764 --> 03:58:07.006]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[03:58:07.106 --> 03:58:09.047]  Some medical-grade stores have it.
[03:58:09.607 --> 03:58:10.868]  It's just incredible.
[03:58:10.968 --> 03:58:12.049]  It's $29.95 out of the gate.
[03:58:12.129 --> 03:58:13.310]  This is next level.
[03:58:13.370 --> 03:58:14.931]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[03:58:15.451 --> 03:58:19.594]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[03:58:19.934 --> 03:58:24.377]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[03:58:24.478 --> 03:58:27.940]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[03:58:28.100 --> 03:58:29.361]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[03:58:29.501 --> 03:58:32.343]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
