[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.210]  I'm Washington right now.
[00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:01.710]  Good.
[00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.271]  We're for free speech.
[00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:10.095]  The question is, are the people who claim they're defending free speech actually defenders of speech?
[00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:11.676]  Hashtag Basta.
[00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:13.357]  Whatever that means.
[00:00:13.397 --> 00:00:16.279]  We'll investigate the assault on free speech after the break.
[00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:24.224]  In the past couple of days you've heard a lot of huffing
[00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:27.251]  I think?
[00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:48.387]  Speech.
[00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.289]  So we know who's for free speech and who's against it.
[00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.514]  And we cannot help but notice that some of free speech's greatest enemies are now posing as its defenders, all of a sudden.
[00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:00.195]  Take CNN, for example.
[00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:09.922]  It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the Internet on the grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say.
[00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:12.764]  Ultimately, CNN succeeded in doing that.
[00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:17.527]  The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones and his outlet, InfoWars.
[00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:24.454]  You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying loss for free speech, because it was exactly that.
[00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:27.798]  But CNN was not done trying to silence its critics.
[00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:33.083]  Last year, the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for creating an anti-CNN meme.
[00:01:33.584 --> 00:01:39.029]  CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin his life if it ever was criticized by him again.
[00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.172]  Now, CNN is claiming to defend free speech, only when it's their speech.
[00:01:44.592 --> 00:01:52.356]  You'll notice, by the way, that CNN did not object when the government threatened to imprison employees of the cable channel RT if they didn't register as foreign agents.
[00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:55.197]  Yes, RT is owned by a foreign government.
[00:01:55.617 --> 00:01:56.517]  So is the BBC.
[00:01:57.218 --> 00:02:00.159]  Until last year, much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign national.
[00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.921]  This is true of other news organizations, none of which has ever registered as a foreign agent.
[00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:13.285]  But because RT is owned by Russia, which the left believes got Donald Trump elected, it is fine with CNN if they are bullied and silenced.
[00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:18.267]  So call CNN what you will, but don't pretend they are defenders of the First Amendment.
[00:02:18.387 --> 00:02:18.928]  They are not.
[00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:24.071]  Victor Davis Hanson is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a close watcher of all as he joins us tonight.
[00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:32.437]  So I just want to be clear, we're always for free speech, especially speech that's offensive, even by obnoxious White House correspondents.
[00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:39.663]  But to see a channel that has lobbied against the right of others to say what they think is true, to all of a sudden emerges as defender of the first amendment is nauseating.
[00:02:40.103 --> 00:02:47.808]  Yeah, I think when people saw the suit, they asked themselves, was there anything in the past that Jim Acosta had said negatively that got him kicked out?
[00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:48.589]  And the answer was no.
[00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.250]  Is there anybody, MSNBC, do they get kicked out?
[00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.971]  The answer is no.
[00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:54.793]  Do other CNN reporters get kicked out?
[00:02:54.813 --> 00:02:55.713]  No, they have passes.
[00:02:55.753 --> 00:02:58.275]  So, it was a particular type of behavior.
[00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:05.718]  I mean, if you're arguing a case before the Supreme Court, you can't go in there and take pictures or interrupt the justice.
[00:03:05.758 --> 00:03:10.659]  They'll kick you out, and if you do it another time, they'll say, we don't want you pleading a case before the Supreme Court.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.601]  Jim Costa can't go in there barefooted and say, I want to express myself.
[00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:18.523]  There are certain protocols and norms of behavior and he's violated them.
[00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:22.845]  That's one issue and then it's not, this is sort of a psychodrama, Tucker.
[00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:29.689]  I mean, remember that the prior administration monitored 20 AP reporters and Fox's own James Rosen.
[00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:39.694]  Nobody filed a suit on behalf of James Rosen from CNN and said, my God, we only learned in 2013 that three years ago the man was being surveilled by the Attorney General.
[00:03:39.734 --> 00:03:41.315]  This is a violation of press freedom.
[00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:42.015]  We didn't hear that.
[00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:50.818]  And you're not hearing CNN say anything about the voices being silenced now online by the big tech companies because they have unfashionable views.
[00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:56.520]  Can you, as a philosophical matter, support free speech in some cases but not in others?
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.800]  I don't think you can.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:08.004]  And then we get to another... If we want to talk about ethics and the protocols of the White House, CNN, 93% of their coverage, according to Shorenstein, is biased.
[00:04:08.524 --> 00:04:12.947]  That is Tucker Carlson valiantly defending the First Amendment last night.
[00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:14.408]  We've got the full report coming up.
[00:04:14.868 --> 00:04:17.890]  Trump is arguing he can ban all reporters from the White House if he wanted to.
[00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.510]  Absolutely.
[00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.831]  But he's not a guy that's been shying away from the press.
[00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:22.332]  He's been running towards the press.
[00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:23.933]  But Jim Acosta is not the press.
[00:04:24.374 --> 00:04:29.116]  He is a disinformation operative and the biggest liar in modern television history.
[00:04:30.177 --> 00:04:36.341]  By the way, the caravan they said doesn't exist just smashed in, as you know, yesterday to the California border and is now overrunning it.
[00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:42.561]  No, I think it's a great idea.
[00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:44.842]  Yeah, I just have to clear with Alex Jones first.
[00:04:46.442 --> 00:04:47.422]  Yeah, well I'll tell you what.
[00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:52.264]  Let me actually go find Alex right now and let's just start moving this along.
[00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:52.764]  What do you think?
[00:04:53.684 --> 00:04:54.324]  Okay, great.
[00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:56.805]  I'm gonna go find Alex Jones and I will call you right back.
[00:05:43.852 --> 00:05:47.735]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:55.741]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:07.077 --> 00:06:08.618]  Epic times, epic times.
[00:06:08.638 --> 00:06:13.160]  The really bad news is post-election blue wave theft.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:23.385]  Democrats have flipped two Senate seats and a large number of House seats since election night and they are feverishly delivering out of the dark of night 18-wheelers.
[00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:29.028]  Full of ballots that almost all go for Democratic candidates.
[00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:41.477]  This is their new form of fraud, where they concede the night of the election, and then start stuffing ballot boxes the next two, three days, and then suddenly, when there's news attention, they declare that they are the victors.
[00:06:43.578 --> 00:06:50.442]  Trump warns the Dems are sending their best thieves directly from Soros operations to do it.
[00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:53.003]  And when they get caught on video, nothing happens.
[00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:59.227]  It's all Broward County and other special counties like it that are known for stealing elections.
[00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:07.952]  When they're close, they just keep the counters going and outvote the surrounding counties in the states.
[00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:09.968]  We're going to be looking at all of that.
[00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:16.023]  Obviously, the creepy porn lawyer who's gone after everybody and their dog with made-up crud.
[00:07:17.285 --> 00:07:24.047]  And who openly brought forward some of the women that have now admitted that they were lying about the whole situation.
[00:07:24.468 --> 00:07:34.211]  And the lawyer for Horseface, Stormy Daniels, has been arrested for beating the living snot, reportedly, allegedly, out of his ex-wife.
[00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:38.012]  And if you go over all the details of it, he looks pretty darn guilty.
[00:07:38.052 --> 00:07:39.053]  She was beat up pretty bad.
[00:07:39.913 --> 00:07:43.799]  He was running around yelling and screaming in the middle of the fancy apartment complex that they were at.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.242]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:46.683 --> 00:07:48.405]  Another one bites the dust.
[00:07:50.267 --> 00:07:51.389]  Creepy porn lawyer.
[00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.075]  But none of that really is a big issue, is it, when you look at the overall field?
[00:07:57.119 --> 00:07:57.319]  of course.
[00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:22.975]  Contradicting CNN, MSNBC, officials to close some northbound lanes of San Diego border crossings ahead of the main caravan's arrival.
[00:08:23.475 --> 00:08:29.300]  About 2,000 people showed up yesterday, sort of climbing the fence, taunting the Border Patrol and U.S.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:29.861]  military.
[00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:34.842]  And trying to get past them, but they're waiting till their main force builds up.
[00:08:35.502 --> 00:08:45.945]  And dozens and dozens of buses have been videotaped arriving, waving their foreign flags and making anti-America statements.
[00:08:47.246 --> 00:08:47.646]  That's right.
[00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:55.468]  These are people specially picked by the UN, by Soros, to be put into these refugee centers for sometimes over a year, brainwashed and prepared.
[00:08:56.766 --> 00:09:07.575]  To be the political foot soldiers, the new pilgrims of the globalists who colonize the United States with pro-Venezuelan communist style ideas, and to be the new voting bloc.
[00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:10.437]  Look at this, why, LA Times!
[00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:20.187]  Officials have closed some northbound lanes of San Diego border crossings ahead of caravans arrival.
[00:09:20.787 --> 00:09:25.769]  Latin American Herald Tribune, migrant caravan arrives in northwestern Mexico as U.S.
[00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:26.829]  reinforces border.
[00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.011]  I've got a big stack of these articles here.
[00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:31.812]  I've got all the videos, but here's the deal.
[00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:41.916]  Jim Acosta, the same time he didn't touch that woman when he did, Jim Acosta said that there is no caravan.
[00:09:43.427 --> 00:09:54.996]  And when Trump said that there was a caravan, while Acosta said, no, it's hundreds of miles away from here.
[00:09:56.498 --> 00:10:10.189]  That's right, just what, two and a half weeks ago, we saw the first caravan of tens of thousands smash down the gates of the Mexican border and storm across the bridge and overwhelm the police.
[00:10:12.864 --> 00:10:19.508]  And then three more caravans at least came through and they made it all the way up through Mexico with buses paid for by U.S.
[00:10:19.548 --> 00:10:20.609]  taxpayers through the U.N.
[00:10:22.486 --> 00:10:24.487]  The media would say, Alex Jones is lying.
[00:10:24.587 --> 00:10:25.388]  Trump is lying.
[00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:26.828]  Tucker Carlson is lying.
[00:10:26.868 --> 00:10:27.989]  There is no caravan.
[00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:29.770]  There is no USAID.
[00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.370]  Why?
[00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:36.814]  When Lou Dobbs had the Judicial Watch head on and said, we have the documents, here they are, that George Soros gets U.S.
[00:10:36.854 --> 00:10:38.615]  taxpayer money from the State Department to fund this.
[00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:40.296]  We need to cut that funding off.
[00:10:40.896 --> 00:10:44.158]  Organized human smuggling across transnational borders is illegal.
[00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:46.299]  This is criminal human trafficking.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.921]  They should be criminally investigated.
[00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:56.675]  Yeah, if I was randomly trying to sneak 10 kids across the border, I should be thrown in prison for a long time.
[00:10:56.715 --> 00:10:58.836]  This is happening with masses of people.
[00:11:01.778 --> 00:11:04.219]  And the media nationally said, Lou Dobbs should be fired.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.041]  It was all true.
[00:11:09.281 --> 00:11:09.922]  It's all true.
[00:11:09.982 --> 00:11:16.665]  And now the caravan has arrived, and all over national media, they're saying it doesn't exist.
[00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:22.773]  They're telling you don't believe your eyes when you see Acosta shove down her arm and grab the mic back away from her.
[00:11:25.534 --> 00:11:27.194]  And say that there is no caravan.
[00:11:27.214 --> 00:11:29.515]  And then he said he didn't know who the woman was.
[00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:31.696]  He thought it was just some random person attacking him.
[00:11:32.036 --> 00:11:33.017]  He's in there every day.
[00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:34.557]  He's at the press conferences every week.
[00:11:35.117 --> 00:11:40.059]  He knows who the young ladies are and young men that walk over and kneel down while you have the mic.
[00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:45.201]  And then as soon as you're done, they stand back up, take it away, and then they give it to whoever the president points to next.
[00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:47.482]  He knows a million percent
[00:11:49.568 --> 00:11:52.209]  But the perfect lies on Anderson Cooper.
[00:11:52.249 --> 00:11:57.310]  By perfect, it was all a wall of just hoax in your face.
[00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.711]  He didn't know who the woman was.
[00:11:58.771 --> 00:12:01.071]  Thought she was mugging him in some dark alley.
[00:12:01.851 --> 00:12:03.132]  There is no caravan.
[00:12:03.492 --> 00:12:05.192]  He'd only asked one question.
[00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:07.033]  He was following protocol.
[00:12:07.073 --> 00:12:08.213]  He didn't lay hands on her.
[00:12:09.053 --> 00:12:14.315]  And CNN is so evil that they argued in federal court
[00:12:15.327 --> 00:12:35.059]  Yesterday, and we're supposed to hear it today, that he didn't touch the woman, that he only asked one question, and that Trump has no right to remove him when CNN lobbied to have us, a year and a half ago, lose our credentials for no reason.
[00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:36.080]  Jerome Corsi was there.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.820]  He was polite.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.500]  He was nice.
[00:12:38.041 --> 00:12:39.842]  He just sat there and never even got a question in.
[00:12:42.026 --> 00:12:46.767]  And they were so upset by that that CNN led the effort to have our credentials pulled.
[00:12:47.707 --> 00:12:48.487]  And they were pulled.
[00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:51.548]  And then they celebrated it all over the news.
[00:12:53.268 --> 00:12:55.129]  And then CNN said, take his banking away.
[00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:56.749]  Take his credit card processing away.
[00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:58.290]  Take him off Twitter, Facebook.
[00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.390]  Take him off iTunes.
[00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.210]  Don't let him be on Spotify.
[00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.071]  Don't let him be anywhere.
[00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:05.131]  And now they're going after our radio affiliates.
[00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:06.251]  Now they're going after our TV affiliates.
[00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:08.852]  And they have whole shows about he's gotta be taken off the air.
[00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:09.472]  He's evil.
[00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.130]  No First Amendment.
[00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:18.454]  But then, oh, Jim Acosta said his rights violated for going in and manhandling a woman and always being disruptive.
[00:13:18.694 --> 00:13:25.177]  The White House press secretary has the total right to exclude or bring in whoever they want.
[00:13:25.857 --> 00:13:30.480]  And Trump's been historically very open to expanding it.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.080]  That's why they've moved it into bigger halls.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.822]  He has more press conferences than any president ever has.
[00:13:35.322 --> 00:13:39.284]  When he's walking to the helicopter, they go, hey, hey, hey, he almost always comes over.
[00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:42.542]  He's trying to suppress the press.
[00:13:42.602 --> 00:13:44.184]  He's keeping the press locked out.
[00:13:44.604 --> 00:13:45.926]  He's doing this, he's doing that.
[00:13:45.986 --> 00:13:48.808]  No, Jim Acosta runs around like a clown.
[00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.411]  Like a clown.
[00:13:53.693 --> 00:14:05.544]  And asks 3, 4, 5, 6 questions, interrupts, yells, screams, screams at Trump and Kim Jong-un from 150 yards away as loud as he can while they're having a private conversation.
[00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:08.259]  What about nuclear war?
[00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:08.740]  Death?
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.220]  Death?
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.620]  You're just trying to disrupt things.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.121]  The guy is a disruptor.
[00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:14.981]  He's not a journalist.
[00:14:17.642 --> 00:14:18.663]  And everybody knows that.
[00:14:18.703 --> 00:14:19.463]  He's a liar.
[00:14:21.183 --> 00:14:22.084]  Jim Acosta here.
[00:14:22.144 --> 00:14:25.765]  I've got a report to you that Trump removed the bust of Martin Luther King.
[00:14:26.405 --> 00:14:27.125]  Jim Acosta here.
[00:14:27.165 --> 00:14:27.785]  I've got a report.
[00:14:27.885 --> 00:14:29.826]  Congressman Scalise is in the hospital.
[00:14:29.866 --> 00:14:30.786]  Trump was not there.
[00:14:30.906 --> 00:14:31.827]  It is a lie.
[00:14:32.187 --> 00:14:33.047]  It is a lie.
[00:14:34.587 --> 00:14:36.028]  How many lies of this guy?
[00:14:37.489 --> 00:14:38.993]  So we're going to find out all about that.
[00:14:39.093 --> 00:14:43.906]  And it's just an illustration of how arrogant and how deceptive and how out of control they are.
[00:14:43.926 --> 00:14:45.611]  And Trump's saying listen!
[00:14:46.863 --> 00:14:48.483]  I don't have to have any press in the White House.
[00:14:48.523 --> 00:14:49.824]  The executive branch can do whatever it wants.
[00:14:50.444 --> 00:14:53.224]  We've been bringing you guys in there for about 60, 70 years.
[00:14:53.584 --> 00:15:00.125]  Before that, it was all the president just gave speeches, or the president wrote articles for newspapers, and then you responded off of what a president said.
[00:15:00.585 --> 00:15:07.507]  I don't have to sit there and give you press conferences every couple days, or talk to the media every day when I go to a helicopter, or go get on Air Force One.
[00:15:07.527 --> 00:15:11.427]  I don't have to bring you on the Air Force One with you if I don't want to.
[00:15:12.268 --> 00:15:13.028]  And that's what I've said.
[00:15:13.128 --> 00:15:13.988]  Why does he have
[00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:16.832]  Jeff Bezos is Washington Post.
[00:15:16.912 --> 00:15:19.053]  It's not a free press organization.
[00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:22.375]  It's a globalist organ trying to undermine the president.
[00:15:22.635 --> 00:15:24.115]  Why does he have those criminals around him?
[00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:25.016]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:15:25.036 --> 00:15:31.219]  They're going to have hearings, they're saying, when the Democrats take control in January, on how he's persecuted the Washington Post and CNN.
[00:15:31.599 --> 00:15:33.100]  Give me a break.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.541]  These are the people that are persecuting the press.
[00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:42.096]  There's only four days left at InfoWareStore.com on one of the biggest sales we've ever had.
[00:15:42.116 --> 00:15:46.703]  67% off, blowout sale, and free shipping storewide.
[00:15:54.278 --> 00:15:59.042]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[00:15:59.062 --> 00:16:16.076]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really severe.
[00:16:16.537 --> 00:16:17.197]  But is it true?
[00:16:18.098 --> 00:16:24.582]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[00:16:25.582 --> 00:16:29.325]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[00:16:30.085 --> 00:16:31.446]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[00:16:32.423 --> 00:16:35.486]  So the establishment wants us off the air at a cost.
[00:16:35.506 --> 00:16:38.790]  Because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming.
[00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.354]  Live every day from 11am to 3pm just on my show.
[00:16:42.614 --> 00:16:45.437]  You got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8am central.
[00:16:45.878 --> 00:16:49.942]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3-6pm in the War Room.
[00:16:50.182 --> 00:16:52.164]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[00:16:52.184 --> 00:16:53.386]  They're trying to block that.
[00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:58.064]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[00:16:58.725 --> 00:17:05.851]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[00:17:06.371 --> 00:17:08.893]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[00:17:09.694 --> 00:17:13.881]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers and not let us advertise online.
[00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:15.343]  Kick us off PayPal.
[00:17:15.363 --> 00:17:16.244]  Kick us off Facebook.
[00:17:16.324 --> 00:17:17.105]  Kick us off Twitter.
[00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:17.967]  Kick us off YouTube.
[00:17:17.987 --> 00:17:24.596]  And over a hundred other platforms now where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[00:17:25.157 --> 00:17:33.185]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:35.287]  That's because we are on target.
[00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:37.489]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[00:17:37.529 --> 00:17:39.431]  We're exposing their main operation.
[00:17:39.952 --> 00:17:41.533]  Look, I know you guys know that.
[00:17:41.974 --> 00:17:42.834]  That's why you've supported us.
[00:17:42.874 --> 00:17:48.920]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:52.144]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[00:17:52.164 --> 00:18:02.419]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:03.800]  To hand-share those links.
[00:18:03.881 --> 00:18:05.463]  To text message people.
[00:18:05.823 --> 00:18:07.244]  Information you think is particularly important.
[00:18:07.925 --> 00:18:09.266]  To get around the censors.
[00:18:09.306 --> 00:18:10.667]  Nothing can stop the word of mouth.
[00:18:11.148 --> 00:18:14.671]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[00:18:14.931 --> 00:18:17.313]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[00:18:17.813 --> 00:18:26.501]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best-rated, best-selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:29.703]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[00:18:29.964 --> 00:18:31.725]  They're all there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:32.546]  Patriot apparel.
[00:18:33.206 --> 00:18:33.687]  It's all there.
[00:18:34.994 --> 00:18:47.442]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:47.542 --> 00:19:00.089]  And we already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.031]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:08.812]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[00:19:08.852 --> 00:19:15.694]  So please take advantage of them today at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[00:19:16.094 --> 00:19:17.534]  Everybody loves Rainforest.
[00:19:17.554 --> 00:19:19.655]  We haven't tried it yet, so 3% off.
[00:19:19.895 --> 00:19:21.495]  Everybody really loves our Coal Oil Silver.
[00:19:21.695 --> 00:19:23.396]  Highest quality, 67% off, silver bullet.

[00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:44.117]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:54.864 --> 00:19:58.245]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[00:19:58.425 --> 00:20:02.386]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:20:03.187 --> 00:20:05.047]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.110]  It is Thursday, November 15, 2018.
[00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.851]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:21.292]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:20:22.432 --> 00:20:23.793]  Now, the corporate media
[00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.172]  From ABC to CBS to NBC, lie a lot and spin a lot.
[00:20:30.612 --> 00:20:34.474]  But there's still some reporters and individuals there that occasionally tell the truth.
[00:20:35.274 --> 00:20:44.478]  And coming up, I'm going to play an amazing report from NBC News in San Francisco to see how truly hellish it is.
[00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:48.780]  The crime, the feces, the needles, the mental illness.
[00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:53.002]  And why does this always come to Democrat-controlled areas?
[00:20:54.246 --> 00:21:05.273]  Because that ties into what's happening in the third world as well, and the fact that civilization never really gets a chance to establish itself in those areas, because rule of law is not respected.
[00:21:07.234 --> 00:21:11.877]  And you look at the Democrats, how they operate, they really have a third world mentality.
[00:21:11.897 --> 00:21:20.283]  And they also have a mentality of lying on purpose to scramble people's brains.
[00:21:23.723 --> 00:21:39.508]  The UN, the IMF, the World Bank, the Soros Group for 20 years has been getting international laws changed to get nations to sign on to the UN via treaty that the UN controls your borders and who is brought in as refugees.
[00:21:42.849 --> 00:21:47.431]  And now it's quote anybody that just wants to leave their poor country that the UN has already sucked dry.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:22:09.100]  Then they're given free credit cards, free debit cards, thousands of dollars per leg, are put in training camps for three months to six months to a year, brainwashed into globalist philosophy, taught to hate Europe, hate America, hate the West, and they are then shipped leg by leg into the Western country.
[00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:13.639]  When we expose this, they go, that's insane, there's no such thing.
[00:22:13.959 --> 00:22:23.348]  Even though it's like saying the Washington Monument doesn't exist, or the Statue of Liberty doesn't exist, or the symbol for Apple computers isn't an apple with a bite out of it.
[00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.631]  You say, how would they do this?
[00:22:26.671 --> 00:22:30.014]  Because first they say, oh, the caravan's coming, open it up, let it in.
[00:22:30.054 --> 00:22:36.140]  Then we say, oh, this is terrible, the UN's funding it, and they go, no, no such thing, Soros isn't involved, there is no caravan.
[00:22:38.769 --> 00:22:40.750]  Or, it's just women and strollers.
[00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:52.076]  When it's 80 plus percent military age men, waving foreign flags, saying, down with America, down with Trump, basically no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:22:52.356 --> 00:22:53.676]  That's the UN creed.
[00:22:53.816 --> 00:23:01.920]  That's the world government creed, is no borders, and the UN and the globalists control the billions of third world people that they can use as weapons against the West.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:07.003]  And then the buses, and the flatback trailers, and the people waving foreign flags, and the school buses.
[00:23:08.868 --> 00:23:10.009]  Paid for by U.S.
[00:23:10.069 --> 00:23:15.774]  taxpayer tax money going through the State Department to the U.N.
[00:23:15.874 --> 00:23:16.795]  That's a fact!
[00:23:17.976 --> 00:23:25.782]  And so instead of addressing what we're saying that's absolute fact, they just say racist, homophobic, liars, fake news.
[00:23:26.823 --> 00:23:29.386]  They think you're so stupid they will show a
[00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:41.811]  Video of Jim Acosta assaulting a woman, according to their definition, putting his hands on her, manhandling her, and then say that's not what it shows and that I faked it or my crew did.
[00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:44.832]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[00:23:45.812 --> 00:23:47.753]  But now, it hits them.
[00:23:50.434 --> 00:23:55.597]  Officials to close some northbound lanes of San Diego border crossing ahead of caravan's arrival.
[00:23:55.997 --> 00:23:56.537]  LA Times.
[00:23:57.137 --> 00:24:00.459]  AP reports the first 2,000 of the Central American
[00:24:02.383 --> 00:24:08.111]  Caravan have arrived, brought in by buses, paid for by international aid groups.
[00:24:08.532 --> 00:24:10.414]  That's in AP, that's in Reuters.
[00:24:11.015 --> 00:24:14.080]  Exactly what I told you a month ago, three weeks ago.
[00:24:16.172 --> 00:24:21.036]  We showed you the documents Judicial Watch got, but you don't need the Judicial Watch documents.
[00:24:21.416 --> 00:24:27.862]  The UN and George Soros are in Reuters, AP Bloomberg, bragging that they're doing this all over the world.
[00:24:28.402 --> 00:24:31.024]  Soros pays for the boats coming across from North Africa.
[00:24:31.645 --> 00:24:38.631]  They've got a UN army and navy forming to stop Italy and Greece from stopping the boats coming and landing.
[00:24:41.502 --> 00:24:51.207]  I can pull up Reuters and AP and Bloomberg showing Soros two years ago saying we're setting up refugee camps in Central America to bring these people to the U.S.
[00:24:51.647 --> 00:24:53.608]  and it's him being praised!
[00:24:55.329 --> 00:25:01.572]  So what level is this where then MSNBC and CNN say it does not exist?
[00:25:04.807 --> 00:25:06.228]  Like, what are they trying to do?
[00:25:06.288 --> 00:25:07.048]  It's insane!
[00:25:07.308 --> 00:25:10.130]  They're telling you don't believe your eyes, as I've been saying.
[00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.190]  Don't believe reality.
[00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.211]  They're just training you to accept being lied to.
[00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:16.693]  Tucker Carlson did a great report, the full report, on Infowars.com.
[00:25:16.733 --> 00:25:18.494]  Here's part of it from his broadcast last night.
[00:25:21.616 --> 00:25:26.919]  Migrant caravan, the one you've been told over and over doesn't exist if you don't believe that you're immoral.
[00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:28.780]  Well, it turns out it does exist.
[00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.991]  It's a physical reality, and in fact, it's here.
[00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:33.892]  It's at the U.S.
[00:25:33.952 --> 00:25:34.272]  border.
[00:25:34.852 --> 00:25:37.593]  A breakaway group from the caravan has made its way to Tijuana.
[00:25:37.613 --> 00:25:39.874]  They didn't walk, as you were told they were doing.
[00:25:39.934 --> 00:25:44.036]  They were driven, and now members are climbing over the border fence there.
[00:25:44.516 --> 00:25:52.820]  The migrants able to reach this country thanks to the assistance of organizations whose explicit purpose is getting people into this country, legally or not.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.381]  Trace Gallagher has more details on what's going on tonight.
[00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:55.581]  Trace?
[00:25:57.253 --> 00:26:03.777]  Tucker, right now there are two primary Central American caravans in Mexico making their way north that include anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 people.
[00:26:03.837 --> 00:26:07.299]  The first of the major caravans is expected to arrive at the U.S.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.900]  border sometime late next week.
[00:26:08.921 --> 00:26:13.844]  But as you say, some 350 migrants have now arrived at the border in Tijuana.
[00:26:14.024 --> 00:26:18.066]  Dozens of them scaled a fence and taunted Border Patrol officers.
[00:26:18.467 --> 00:26:21.108]  Others stood at the fence or hung out on the beach.
[00:26:21.188 --> 00:26:26.031]  But they want their presence known to both the Border Patrol and the media.
[00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:26.472]  Watch this.
[00:26:28.308 --> 00:26:28.952]  Dura pape!
[00:26:29.455 --> 00:26:31.184]  Puro dura, puro castracho!
[00:26:32.984 --> 00:26:35.425]  Yeah, Catracho is slang for Honduran.
[00:26:35.745 --> 00:26:41.528]  There are reports these migrants broke from the main caravan about four or five days ago and took buses north.
[00:26:41.868 --> 00:26:52.214]  Impossible to tell exactly how many are from the caravan because the Border Patrol tells us Central American migrants sometimes arrive in droves every single day at the U.S.
[00:26:52.254 --> 00:26:52.554]  border.
[00:26:52.834 --> 00:27:02.539]  We certainly know that many of these migrants are being coached by groups like Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders, a Chicago-based immigration advocacy group.
[00:27:02.899 --> 00:27:12.242]  In fact, even left-leaning news organizations like the LA Times and Washington Post have reported that members of Pueblo Sin Fronteras are embedded with the caravan.
[00:27:12.622 --> 00:27:16.103]  And our sources tell us these types of groups are guiding the migrants.
[00:27:16.143 --> 00:27:20.724]  For example, Mexico has offered most of these people both asylum and jobs.
[00:27:20.844 --> 00:27:28.366]  Okay, and you notice the group he named is half funded by Soros and other groups and the rest the State Department.
[00:27:28.926 --> 00:27:30.747]  So your taxpayer money
[00:27:31.647 --> 00:27:35.728]  Pays for all this, these NGOs, and then they tell you it doesn't exist.
[00:27:35.748 --> 00:27:42.111]  We're going to come back and play more of that and tie it into the larger plan to completely collapse our borders.
[00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:45.192]  But how insulting to have them behave like this.
[00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:46.472]  Now, let me stop right there.
[00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:53.815]  The Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest, stainless steel water filtration system.
[00:27:55.255 --> 00:27:56.476]  We're their main distributor.
[00:27:57.036 --> 00:27:59.057]  It's the number one company in the world for gravity-fed filters.
[00:27:59.177 --> 00:27:59.657]  It's the best.
[00:28:00.728 --> 00:28:08.234]  They ordered way too many this year and don't want to have to pay at the end of the year the extra tax on inventory at state and federal level.
[00:28:08.274 --> 00:28:08.834]  It's a lot of money.
[00:28:10.195 --> 00:28:15.979]  So they are selling them to us at their cost and then we're making like $25.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.583]  No one has ever been able to get a gravity fed filter this good at this price.
[00:28:20.883 --> 00:28:23.325]  Leading competitors aren't as good and one this size is $300.
[00:28:23.385 --> 00:28:25.146]  He's throwing me a great deal at $249.
[00:28:25.186 --> 00:28:25.746]  It's $127 off right now.
[00:28:29.966 --> 00:28:34.132]  Alexa Pure Pro, exclusively at Infowarstore.com at that price.
[00:28:34.452 --> 00:28:35.794]  Get one for yourself and your family.
[00:28:40.941 --> 00:28:41.601]  Alright, you rolling?
[00:28:44.185 --> 00:28:44.806]  What am I gonna say?
[00:28:47.486 --> 00:29:01.732]  There is a corporate consortium of anti-free market monopoly men who have allied themselves with Communist China, the dictatorial EU, America hating Hollywood, and others who think Americans are a bunch of dumb chumps who they can walk in here and rob.
[00:29:02.492 --> 00:29:04.373]  That it was basic American free market liberty.
[00:29:06.098 --> 00:29:07.940]  That produced all this incredible wealth.
[00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:18.391]  So we should stand up against globalism, not just for the wealth, but because the globalists are so incredibly oppressive and ally themselves with every horrible form of...
[00:29:21.255 --> 00:29:21.876]  Evil regime.
[00:29:22.376 --> 00:29:23.297]  Radical Islam.
[00:29:23.317 --> 00:29:24.738]  The Communist Chinese.
[00:29:24.838 --> 00:29:28.220]  The evil Junker of the EU.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.541]  It's just crazy.
[00:29:30.082 --> 00:29:31.623]  Of course we can beat these people.
[00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.584]  Of course they can be stopped.
[00:29:33.745 --> 00:29:37.087]  But we have to stand against them and say no to their operation.
[00:29:37.547 --> 00:29:40.450]  I always wondered 30 years ago why we couldn't defeat the globalists.
[00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.111]  Then about 25 years ago, I got politically involved.
[00:29:44.071 --> 00:29:45.071]  23 years ago, I got on air.
[00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:45.811]  Then I learned why.
[00:29:45.831 --> 00:29:47.432]  Because you get fired.
[00:29:47.912 --> 00:29:49.212]  Because you get demonized.
[00:29:49.252 --> 00:29:50.273]  Because you get sued.
[00:29:50.373 --> 00:29:51.993]  Because you get physically assaulted.
[00:29:53.374 --> 00:29:55.314]  And the globalists are betting you're a bunch of cowards.
[00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:58.215]  And so you'll never stick your head up because you don't want that to happen.
[00:29:59.075 --> 00:30:04.737]  But instead, you have your whole birthright stolen, you become a slave, and you die a thousand deaths instead of one death.
[00:30:04.757 --> 00:30:08.018]  Well, I'd rather die that one death instead of a thousand, but we don't have to die.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.381]  We've simply got to get engaged.
[00:30:11.521 --> 00:30:14.082]  They fear the InfoWars audience, because you're not a regular audience.
[00:30:14.142 --> 00:30:19.405]  You are men and women in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about in that beautiful speech.
[00:30:20.206 --> 00:30:22.967]  And that's why I know we're going to win.
[00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:30.151]  Because of you, every race, color, and creed who have red blood, who believe in liberty, I stand with you, you stand with me, and it's amazing.
[00:30:30.831 --> 00:30:32.312]  That's why we're launching another initiative.
[00:30:32.932 --> 00:30:37.454]  I know it got Trump's attention when I sent 100,000 letters to him a year and a half ago about internet censorship.
[00:30:37.934 --> 00:30:42.276]  We're going to send a million letters at writetrump.com.
[00:30:42.356 --> 00:30:43.796]  You can print it off yourself and mail it.
[00:30:44.637 --> 00:30:45.997]  That way two letters go per person.
[00:30:46.037 --> 00:30:49.779]  But regardless, I'm going to mail it in an envelope to the White House.
[00:30:49.839 --> 00:30:50.359]  I want to send
[00:30:51.826 --> 00:30:57.028]  About 80% of whatever we get in, I hope it'll be a million, that's up to you, to the White House.
[00:30:57.048 --> 00:31:00.049]  Another 100,000 to Mar-a-Lago, another 100,000 to Trump Tower.
[00:31:00.329 --> 00:31:07.732]  So there's no way the President isn't knee-deep in these and he pays attention to a letter, he sees that as like 10,000 emails.
[00:31:08.212 --> 00:31:09.932]  That you took action, that you got involved.
[00:31:10.132 --> 00:31:16.675]  Separately, when you sign up, we'll be able to send you alerts about the fight against censorship and against the globalists.
[00:31:16.715 --> 00:31:17.095]  So again,
[00:31:18.408 --> 00:31:19.429]  RightTrump.com.
[00:31:19.449 --> 00:31:22.012]  Go read the letter that Roger Stone and I have written to the president.
[00:31:22.073 --> 00:31:24.155]  You can add your own or just send it alone.
[00:31:24.656 --> 00:31:26.177]  Again, print it off, send it yourself.
[00:31:26.278 --> 00:31:27.479]  We're going to send it regardless.
[00:31:27.839 --> 00:31:28.400]  It's so easy.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.461]  Go spend two minutes.
[00:31:29.962 --> 00:31:30.683]  Go to RightTrump.com.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.040]  Sign up, send a letter.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.581]  It'll be legitimately from you.
[00:31:34.861 --> 00:31:40.462]  Hopefully you add something to it so that it'll be a two-page letter, not just our letter, and this will have a big effect.
[00:31:40.902 --> 00:31:42.862]  And regardless, it gets the globalist attention.
[00:31:43.142 --> 00:31:43.983]  So we're not laying down.
[00:31:44.023 --> 00:31:47.143]  We're not just curling up in a ball in the fetal position and taking all this crap.
[00:31:47.503 --> 00:31:50.164]  Trump has said he's getting ready for antitrust action against big tech.
[00:31:50.504 --> 00:31:53.585]  He's getting ready to take on the globalist media that is the enemy of the people.
[00:31:54.085 --> 00:32:00.066]  We have to stand with the president now more than ever, and we have to let him know there's a coalition of a million people
[00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:03.369]  I'm going to found an organization very soon as well.
[00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:06.493]  That's another reason to come sign up with us so I can stay in contact with you.
[00:32:06.513 --> 00:32:11.420]  But this is phase one to show the president that we're sending him a million real letters.
[00:32:12.628 --> 00:32:14.029]  It's all about to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:19.051]  We can do it if you take action and tell others to take action at WriteTrump.com.
[00:32:19.231 --> 00:32:33.516]  So go there yourself, text message, email your friends, neighbors, family, and tell them, get involved and stand up to Apple, stand up to Google, stand up to Facebook, stand up to Twitter and let them know America is unifying, America and the world is organizing and taking action.
[00:32:34.057 --> 00:32:34.737]  God bless you all.
[00:32:42.498 --> 00:32:47.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:59.405 --> 00:33:03.247]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[00:33:03.847 --> 00:33:07.089]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:11.736 --> 00:33:16.960]  I might play a Tucker Carlson clip once every week or so, but today I'm going to be playing three of them.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:28.469]  His broadcast last night that I didn't catch live, that I watched this morning, or listened to while I was exercising, is 45 minutes of pure Veritas.
[00:33:29.309 --> 00:33:30.710]  From the start to the finish.
[00:33:32.131 --> 00:33:32.712]  It was amazing.
[00:33:33.868 --> 00:33:36.590]  The Democrats openly say they're coming to ban the Second Amendment.
[00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.991]  He showed all the proof of that in a segment.
[00:33:38.572 --> 00:33:44.117]  They're openly calling to ban the First Amendment for all conservatives and Christians, while claiming Trump's taking their free speech, which he's not.
[00:33:44.537 --> 00:33:45.177]  Very powerful.
[00:33:45.598 --> 00:33:47.459]  They're saying the caravan doesn't exist.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:55.226]  At first they said it was great, let it through, it's not funded by anybody, it's not funded with your taxpayer money, Soros isn't involved.
[00:33:55.606 --> 00:33:58.268]  Then it all came out it was, so they just went, doesn't exist.
[00:33:58.989 --> 00:34:00.010]  So I was playing a clip earlier,
[00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:08.292]  Of Tucker and his reporter guest in Southern California laying all this out.
[00:34:09.012 --> 00:34:10.092]  And then Tucker going.
[00:34:10.412 --> 00:34:16.454]  Now the LA Times and Washington Post are now admitting that there is a caravan and it is funded by UN groups.
[00:34:18.334 --> 00:34:20.955]  And there's also a moon that orbits the Earth.
[00:34:22.255 --> 00:34:23.536]  And water is wet.
[00:34:24.776 --> 00:34:26.777]  And the American flag is red, white, and blue.
[00:34:28.157 --> 00:34:31.358]  But this is the level and there's only two genders.
[00:34:34.366 --> 00:34:35.187]  And stuff like that.
[00:34:35.227 --> 00:34:36.588]  And communism is horrible.
[00:34:38.249 --> 00:34:39.810]  But again, the Democrats know all this.
[00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:41.591]  They have an agenda to take over.
[00:34:41.651 --> 00:34:42.552]  They're authoritarians.
[00:34:42.852 --> 00:34:45.034]  They say a nation-state existing is bad.
[00:34:45.614 --> 00:34:49.637]  And conservatives and nationalists are like, we're sorry we believe a country exists.
[00:34:50.438 --> 00:34:51.839]  We should not be on our heels.
[00:34:51.879 --> 00:34:54.081]  We should be in their face laughing at these people.
[00:34:55.061 --> 00:34:56.002]  They're going to have hearings.
[00:34:59.605 --> 00:35:03.688]  In January, as soon as they get in, they've announced in the Intelligence Committee,
[00:35:05.544 --> 00:35:09.347]  About Trump persecuting the Washington Post and CNN.
[00:35:09.687 --> 00:35:11.809]  Two groups openly trying to destroy him.
[00:35:12.389 --> 00:35:15.431]  Two groups openly publishing thousands of fake stories.
[00:35:16.132 --> 00:35:18.814]  And Trump says, I'm going to criticize you.
[00:35:18.954 --> 00:35:19.774]  I'm going to fire back.
[00:35:19.794 --> 00:35:22.076]  And they go, oh my god, a president says we're lying.
[00:35:22.316 --> 00:35:24.118]  Let's have an investigation.
[00:35:24.598 --> 00:35:25.539]  What a joke.
[00:35:26.099 --> 00:35:29.982]  When both of those groups have worked their butts off to take me off the air.
[00:35:31.274 --> 00:35:32.855]  And Tucker Carlson pointed that out last night.
[00:35:33.236 --> 00:35:34.877]  It is just outrageous.
[00:35:35.637 --> 00:35:37.179]  They told a federal judge.
[00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:38.399]  I've got the lawsuit right here.
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.180]  CNN.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.741]  Fox News joined them.
[00:35:41.142 --> 00:35:43.844]  You know Tucker's bucking back against that.
[00:35:43.924 --> 00:35:46.646]  I guarantee you he got chewed out for what he did last night.
[00:35:47.086 --> 00:35:47.727]  Standing up for the truth.
[00:35:48.747 --> 00:35:51.550]  Fox News says Costa never touched that woman.
[00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:56.433]  And the sky's falling and Chicken Little's real.
[00:35:57.374 --> 00:36:00.096]  And everybody's like, well he did push her arm down and grab the mic away.
[00:36:00.376 --> 00:36:00.937]  We all saw it.
[00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:05.175]  The establishment, I know people at Fox News, okay?
[00:36:05.415 --> 00:36:07.536]  The people running Fox News are like Democrats.
[00:36:08.136 --> 00:36:09.636]  They just want to control the conservative movement.
[00:36:09.956 --> 00:36:13.717]  Tucker and Hannity and others, they're good, but they're treated like crap.
[00:36:14.737 --> 00:36:16.238]  Because they're the smart intellectuals.
[00:36:16.558 --> 00:36:17.358]  They're the patriots.
[00:36:17.818 --> 00:36:19.678]  The left wants to control everything.
[00:36:21.819 --> 00:36:28.500]  That's why they have Fox there, so at key points they can do stuff like join CNN in attacking the president.
[00:36:30.572 --> 00:36:33.856]  It's really amazing to see how many traitors there are, but I digress.
[00:36:34.136 --> 00:36:43.528]  After I play a few more minutes of this Tucker piece, I'm going to get into the real meat and potatoes of what's really happening here and what the Democrats finally admit for a change they're really up to.
[00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:48.554]  A rare moment of truth from Chuckie Schumer and Barack Obama, but here's more of Tucker Carlson's report.
[00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:59.060]  In fact, even left-leaning news organizations like the LA Times and Washington Post have reported that members of Pueblo Sin Fronteras are embedded with the caravan.
[00:36:59.481 --> 00:37:02.944]  And our sources tell us these types of groups are guiding the migrants.
[00:37:02.985 --> 00:37:09.652]  For example, Mexico has offered most of these people both asylum and jobs, and yet they continue heading north.
[00:37:10.132 --> 00:37:11.933]  Also, they could move toward the U.S.
[00:37:12.013 --> 00:37:24.359]  border in Texas, but instead they go the long way, hundreds of miles out of their way toward Tijuana, and that's because the goal is to get to California, take advantage of the state's sanctuary laws and the benefits that go along with that.
[00:37:24.399 --> 00:37:30.802]  Of course, once thousands begin arriving in the next few weeks, sympathetic groups will be at the border to greet them.
[00:37:31.302 --> 00:37:31.562]  Tucker.
[00:37:32.503 --> 00:37:33.884]  Trace Gallagher, thanks for that update.
[00:37:34.044 --> 00:37:34.544]  Appreciate it.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:48.955]  Well, the images you just saw are embarrassing and awkward for the liars you've been watching on television for the past month, the ones who've been lecturing you that the caravan doesn't exist and telling you that everything is just fine at the border.
[00:37:50.373 --> 00:37:57.119]  The president, along with his favorite TV network, were beating the drum on the looming so-called invasion, as they put it.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.002]  The programming on the caravan was propaganda.
[00:38:00.182 --> 00:38:02.725]  It was political campaign-motivated propaganda.
[00:38:02.805 --> 00:38:05.007]  Trump is like a racist Paul Revere, you know?
[00:38:05.047 --> 00:38:06.108]  The migrants are coming!
[00:38:06.148 --> 00:38:07.109]  The migrants are coming!
[00:38:07.669 --> 00:38:09.570]  He keeps calling it an invasion!
[00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.851]  Yes, an invasion of strollers.
[00:38:11.991 --> 00:38:12.712]  By the way, hit pause.
[00:38:12.732 --> 00:38:13.572]  Made news by ratcheting.
[00:38:13.852 --> 00:38:14.933]  Back that up ten seconds, please.
[00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:35.583]  We're gonna take this video, we're doing it right now, of all these Democrat globalist operatives, when the UN plan is to break down borders, build the refugee centers, and flood the West with people who then overwhelm the welfare system and make the country collapse, then the globalists come in with a Marshall Plan, this is Soros' own words, and reorganize the EU and the US.
[00:38:36.263 --> 00:38:44.749]  They are bankrupting us on purpose, bringing in unskilled workers, when on record, they're automating everything and there'll be no unskilled workers.
[00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:48.972]  This is a permanent political underclass, a new welfare class.
[00:38:49.652 --> 00:38:52.774]  The worst of the worst out of Latin America and the Middle East.
[00:38:53.335 --> 00:38:53.615]  On record.
[00:38:55.094 --> 00:39:00.576]  And a military tactic is when you're attacking somebody, you broadcast this is not an attack.
[00:39:00.976 --> 00:39:07.319]  World War I, World War II, they would broadcast out of the tanks, we are not attacking, everything's fine, lay down your arms, we are not shooting you.
[00:39:07.339 --> 00:39:12.541]  And then they'd be shooting you because they found a certain percentage of folks would say, they want to be friends, let's stop fighting!
[00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:14.762]  You'd stand up, you'd get killed.
[00:39:15.885 --> 00:39:24.891]  So it's a PSYOP tactic to tell you none of this is happening, so you make the debate about, yes it is happening, and never get to the point of decision to take action.
[00:39:25.471 --> 00:39:29.854]  Trump just says you're a bunch of liars, it's an invasion, get out of the way, we've got borders, we're a country.
[00:39:30.855 --> 00:39:35.518]  Europe didn't stand up for six years and 15 million military-age men poured in.
[00:39:36.678 --> 00:39:38.720]  And now Europe's tourism, everything's gone.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.821]  It's a hell pit.
[00:39:42.122 --> 00:39:43.423]  A hell pit in most areas.
[00:39:45.097 --> 00:39:45.540]  Let's continue.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.615]  Everything is just fine at the border.
[00:39:49.045 --> 00:39:55.769]  The president, along with his favorite TV network, were beating the drum on the looming so-called invasion, as they put it.
[00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:58.650]  The programming on the caravan was propaganda.
[00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:01.292]  It was political campaign-motivated propaganda.
[00:40:01.452 --> 00:40:03.673]  Trump is like a racist Paul Revere, you know?
[00:40:03.713 --> 00:40:04.774]  The migrants are coming!
[00:40:04.814 --> 00:40:05.774]  The migrants are coming!
[00:40:06.355 --> 00:40:08.176]  He keeps calling it an invasion!
[00:40:08.196 --> 00:40:10.577]  Yes, an invasion of strollers.
[00:40:10.997 --> 00:40:17.741]  He made news by ratcheting up the caravan scare talk and the troop numbers he believes are needed to meet this alleged threat.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:25.405]  This so-called invasion, so people are streaming over the border illegally, what would you call it?
[00:40:26.246 --> 00:40:26.666]  I don't know.
[00:40:26.826 --> 00:40:28.608]  You're not allowed to call it anything, actually.
[00:40:28.968 --> 00:40:30.370]  This is a recurring theme on the left.
[00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:32.431]  Don't believe your own eyes.
[00:40:32.492 --> 00:40:35.014]  You're too dumb to trust your own senses.
[00:40:35.514 --> 00:40:36.795]  Listen to the smart kids.
[00:40:37.136 --> 00:40:37.796]  They know best.
[00:40:38.137 --> 00:40:39.398]  There's no crisis on the border.
[00:40:39.918 --> 00:40:45.043]  Even as hundreds of thousands of people stream into this country every year illegally, there's no illegal immigration crisis.
[00:40:45.103 --> 00:40:49.364]  Yeah, there are 22 million people living here illegally.
[00:40:49.664 --> 00:40:50.384]  It's not a crisis.
[00:40:50.424 --> 00:40:51.044]  It's not real.
[00:40:51.704 --> 00:40:57.806]  They'll tell you that on a loop endlessly until the day they retake power, at which point they'll say the crisis is real.
[00:40:58.046 --> 00:41:04.067]  In fact, it's so enormous, we can only solve it by granting blanket amnesty to all the people here illegally.
[00:41:04.307 --> 00:41:05.768]  There are 22 million, after all.
[00:41:05.988 --> 00:41:06.748]  What else can we do?
[00:41:08.028 --> 00:41:13.294]  This is a metaphor really for the left's entire program, which is built entirely on denying reality.
[00:41:13.414 --> 00:41:15.076]  They deny the reality of illegal immigration.
[00:41:15.537 --> 00:41:16.998]  They deny the reality of terrorism.
[00:41:17.339 --> 00:41:19.521]  They deny the reality of biological gender.
[00:41:20.121 --> 00:41:24.746]  And woe to the person who raises his hand and tries to insert reality into the conversation.
[00:41:25.447 --> 00:41:26.168]  They don't want that.
[00:41:26.488 --> 00:41:32.853]  When you have a program built entirely on denial and deception, it's not surprising you're also against free speech.
[00:41:33.033 --> 00:41:35.395]  You can't afford to have an honest conversation.
[00:41:35.955 --> 00:41:37.557]  We'd like to have an honest conversation.
[00:41:37.577 --> 00:41:39.178]  That's why we're speaking tonight to Brian Dean Wright.
[00:41:39.498 --> 00:41:42.521]  He's a Democrat and a former CIA officer and he joins us on Saturday.
[00:41:42.541 --> 00:41:43.441]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:41:44.362 --> 00:41:51.067]  We're going to come back and I'm going to get to the rest of the story with Chuckie Schumer and Obama actually being honest about all this.
[00:41:51.127 --> 00:41:54.370]  But, again, this is the number one issue.
[00:41:55.768 --> 00:41:56.608]  All of it goes together.
[00:41:56.788 --> 00:42:23.194]  The attacks on sovereignty, destroying the borders, is a world government corporate attack, using third world labor to drive down your wages, then collapsing the third world, then turning it as a weapon against the West to come in and be a political underclass, to be weaponized against the first world population, directed by the UN and the globalists, and then engage in election fraud so that the public, before it's too late, can't reverse course.
[00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:24.594]  We are under attack.
[00:42:26.107 --> 00:42:27.689]  This is the new 21st century war.
[00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.512]  New wars aren't ever like the last wars.
[00:42:31.132 --> 00:42:32.213]  We're fighting a new war.
[00:42:32.674 --> 00:42:33.475]  We're under attack.
[00:42:33.535 --> 00:42:34.316]  It's undeclared.
[00:42:35.136 --> 00:42:36.177]  But we are under attack.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.664]  There's only four days left at importwarsetore.com on one of the biggest sales we've ever had.
[00:42:42.684 --> 00:42:47.289]  67% off blowout sale and free shipping storewide.
[00:42:54.821 --> 00:42:59.582]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[00:42:59.622 --> 00:43:16.607]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[00:43:17.087 --> 00:43:17.727]  But is it true?
[00:43:18.647 --> 00:43:25.158]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.566]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[00:43:29.586 --> 00:43:32.050]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[00:43:32.975 --> 00:43:41.139]  So the establishment wants us off the air because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming live every day from 11 a.m.
[00:43:41.499 --> 00:43:41.940]  to 3 p.m.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.780]  just on my show.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.602]  Then you got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[00:43:45.642 --> 00:43:45.962]  Central.
[00:43:46.422 --> 00:43:49.864]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:43:49.884 --> 00:43:50.484]  in the War Room.
[00:43:50.724 --> 00:43:52.705]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[00:43:52.725 --> 00:43:53.906]  They're trying to block that.
[00:43:54.827 --> 00:43:58.610]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[00:43:59.291 --> 00:44:06.397]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[00:44:06.917 --> 00:44:09.439]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:25.106]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers, not let us advertise online, kick us off PayPal, kick us off Facebook, kick us off Twitter, kick us off YouTube, and over a hundred other platforms now, where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[00:44:25.706 --> 00:44:33.229]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[00:44:33.789 --> 00:44:35.830]  That's because we are on target.
[00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:38.031]  We're exposing the globalist paradigm.
[00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:39.972]  We're exposing their main operation.
[00:44:40.472 --> 00:44:42.093]  Look, I know you guys know that.
[00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:43.373]  That's why you've supported us.
[00:44:43.413 --> 00:44:49.516]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:44:50.757 --> 00:44:52.678]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[00:44:52.699 --> 00:45:02.969]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:04.350]  To hand-share those links.
[00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:05.952]  To text message people.
[00:45:06.372 --> 00:45:07.793]  Information you think is particularly important.
[00:45:08.474 --> 00:45:09.795]  To get around the censors.
[00:45:09.835 --> 00:45:11.196]  Nothing can stop your word of mouth.
[00:45:11.697 --> 00:45:15.220]  And yes, to financially support MFull Horse.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.282]  And we make it easy to support MFull Horse.
[00:45:18.362 --> 00:45:22.266]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products.
[00:45:22.826 --> 00:45:27.050]  Make them better, and then discount.
[00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:30.252]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[00:45:30.513 --> 00:45:32.434]  They're all there at MFullHorseStore.com.
[00:45:32.494 --> 00:45:33.095]  Patriot apparel.
[00:45:33.755 --> 00:45:34.236]  It's all there.
[00:45:35.526 --> 00:45:47.952]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:45:48.072 --> 00:46:00.659]  And we already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[00:46:01.639 --> 00:46:04.582]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:09.366]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[00:46:09.406 --> 00:46:16.271]  So please take advantage of them today at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:16.652 --> 00:46:18.073]  Everybody loves Great Force.
[00:46:18.093 --> 00:46:19.474]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[00:46:19.895 --> 00:46:20.215]  30% off.
[00:46:20.455 --> 00:46:22.056]  Everybody really loves our Coil Silver.
[00:46:22.277 --> 00:46:23.357]  Highest quality, 67% off.
[00:46:23.377 --> 00:46:23.898]  Silver Bullet.
[00:46:25.379 --> 00:46:31.102]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:37.805]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[00:46:41.946 --> 00:46:44.587]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:00.538 --> 00:47:01.799]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:02.279]  to 3 p.m.
[00:47:02.299 --> 00:47:02.620]  I'm here.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.942]  David Knight's here in the mornings with the David Knight Show, 8 a.m.
[00:47:05.962 --> 00:47:06.282]  Central.
[00:47:06.922 --> 00:47:10.365]  Owen Schroer coming up 3 o'clock Central with The Wall Room.
[00:47:11.225 --> 00:47:11.866]  Look on my phone.
[00:47:11.886 --> 00:47:13.827]  I just pulled this up for TV viewers.
[00:47:14.167 --> 00:47:15.829]  Caravan of migrants reaches U.S.
[00:47:15.869 --> 00:47:16.209]  border.
[00:47:16.889 --> 00:47:19.311]  Temporarily turned away by Border Patrol.
[00:47:20.131 --> 00:47:22.653]  No, that's not November 2018.
[00:47:22.693 --> 00:47:23.514]  That's April 2018.
[00:47:23.554 --> 00:47:25.395]  That's April 30th.
[00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:34.051]  But I thought there's no such thing as any of these folks.
[00:47:34.731 --> 00:47:35.671]  We can put it up on screen.
[00:47:35.691 --> 00:47:39.893]  You know, our own Millie Weaver was there too.
[00:47:40.033 --> 00:47:42.254]  She shot multiple hour-long reports.
[00:47:42.634 --> 00:47:49.796]  Large groups of them were actually Muslims who had come in out of the Middle East and who had come up.
[00:47:50.596 --> 00:47:55.678]  And we have all those interviews that Millie Weaver shot live on the Mexico side.
[00:47:55.698 --> 00:47:59.399]  And by the way, most of those folks ended up being let in.
[00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:11.898]  And of course it's the United Nations, with your taxpayer money, paying to bring mainly destitute people up from Latin America.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.142]  It's certainly not a brain drain out of Latin America.
[00:48:19.586 --> 00:48:22.829]  Of course there's Muslims out of Central and South America coming in as well.
[00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:25.371]  So if you're a TV viewer, you're seeing all of this.
[00:48:26.638 --> 00:48:36.323]  Five years ago, we first broke Obama secretly bringing in thousands of people a day at McAllen, Texas, alone and loading them on buses, ordering Border Patrol to stand down.
[00:48:36.363 --> 00:48:37.003]  We broke that.
[00:48:37.063 --> 00:48:40.385]  It took a year to get the New York Times to cover it.
[00:48:40.505 --> 00:48:43.866]  Matt Drudge linked to our story, but Fox News didn't even cover it.
[00:48:45.167 --> 00:48:52.491]  These caravans are hitting every few weeks in Texas and in California, mainly.
[00:48:53.391 --> 00:48:55.352]  And when I say caravans, I mean five, ten thousand.
[00:48:57.173 --> 00:48:57.433]  5-10,000.
[00:48:59.013 --> 00:49:04.135]  Finally though, big ones of 10-20,000, remember the news called them a couple hundred a few weeks ago?
[00:49:04.475 --> 00:49:07.155]  Now I told you it was tens of thousands, but now they call it 5-10,000?
[00:49:07.275 --> 00:49:08.535]  No, it's way more than that.
[00:49:10.516 --> 00:49:14.757]  They arrive, tear down the giant fences.
[00:49:15.077 --> 00:49:18.498]  Now, the latest group decided to go on ahead and get there first.
[00:49:19.358 --> 00:49:20.838]  You notice there's no women and children there.
[00:49:22.218 --> 00:49:24.379]  It's about 2,000 of them local news is reporting.
[00:49:25.438 --> 00:49:30.720]  About 2,000 have shown up to taunt and wait for the larger groups to get there that are a few days behind.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.900]  They say they're going to be hitting around Thanksgiving.
[00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:36.362]  Thanksgiving.
[00:49:37.322 --> 00:49:45.545]  And again, this is the UN directing all of this, and the people are burning American flags, chanting down with Trump, down with America, saying, you'll never stop us.
[00:49:46.085 --> 00:49:48.946]  And California's there with big open arms.
[00:49:50.526 --> 00:49:52.587]  And then you've got California and other states.
[00:49:54.477 --> 00:50:00.442]  Legislatures passing laws that illegal aliens can vote, but then the governors don't sign them because it becomes such a constitutional crisis.
[00:50:00.843 --> 00:50:03.445]  Instead, they then pass city laws and then wink, wink.
[00:50:04.426 --> 00:50:06.988]  They go, oh, they're just voting in school elections and things.
[00:50:07.588 --> 00:50:12.313]  But then now it's, oh, and we're going to let them vote as well with no ID.
[00:50:14.195 --> 00:50:20.418]  And then magically every Republican who even was ahead 10-15 points in the polls all magically lost.
[00:50:20.978 --> 00:50:23.800]  Everything went pure blue because that's what's happening.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:24.580]  Fraud.
[00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:26.821]  Like you're seeing in Florida.
[00:50:27.161 --> 00:50:28.062]  Like you're seeing in Arizona.
[00:50:28.462 --> 00:50:34.825]  You're seeing real naked criminal will exercised because we the people are still asleep.
[00:50:35.947 --> 00:50:42.291]  This audience isn't asleep, the president's not asleep, but by and large people don't get this is 21st century warfare.
[00:50:42.511 --> 00:50:45.713]  This is using billions of people as political weapons.
[00:50:47.274 --> 00:50:55.200]  So, remember about two years ago and two months, about 26 months ago, Obama said, hey, if you are in the country, it's your right to vote.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.181]  He basically said, if you're an illegal alien, vote.
[00:50:57.541 --> 00:50:59.643]  And Chuckie Schumer said the same thing last night.
[00:51:00.063 --> 00:51:01.284]  This is their next move.
[00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:05.693]  And Pelosi has said it's time to let immigrants vote.
[00:51:06.754 --> 00:51:08.075]  See, now we're suppressing them.
[00:51:08.095 --> 00:51:12.619]  They come here, and they get to have their kids for free, and get all the welfare, and milk everything.
[00:51:14.241 --> 00:51:15.722]  The promised land of California.
[00:51:17.864 --> 00:51:21.307]  California's a net loser for the whole nation, sucking off everybody.
[00:51:21.327 --> 00:51:22.948]  The big parasite.
[00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:28.733]  And the brains are exiting California, but in come the unwashed masses.
[00:51:29.673 --> 00:51:31.094]  The reason is, first of all, when you vote
[00:51:40.891 --> 00:51:50.196]  You are a citizen yourself and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating etc.
[00:51:50.556 --> 00:51:56.059]  The saying to the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:01.583]  If you have a family member who maybe is undocumented then
[00:52:02.643 --> 00:52:04.503]  You have an even greater reason to vote.
[00:52:04.623 --> 00:52:08.264]  This has been a huge fear presented, especially during this election.
[00:52:08.304 --> 00:52:11.565]  The reason that fear is promoted is because they don't want people voting.
[00:52:11.805 --> 00:52:13.365]  People are discouraged from voting.
[00:52:13.945 --> 00:52:28.228]  And part of what is important for Latino citizens is to make your voice heard because you're not just speaking for yourself, you're speaking for family members, friends, classmates of yours in school.
[00:52:28.248 --> 00:52:29.049]  Your entire community.
[00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:30.869]  Who may not have a voice.
[00:52:33.447 --> 00:52:37.530]  So he leaves it with some ambiguity there, but it's very clear what he's saying.
[00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:42.013]  And then he does that weird thing, like when Hillary goes to Kentucky, and she goes, how you doin' out there?
[00:52:42.033 --> 00:52:43.394]  You want some possum pie?
[00:52:44.514 --> 00:52:45.175]  It's the same thing.
[00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:46.656]  He goes, Latino.
[00:52:47.016 --> 00:52:49.818]  And it's this thing, like if you say it like that, oh, then you like Latinos.
[00:52:50.859 --> 00:52:51.919]  It's very condescending.
[00:52:54.141 --> 00:53:01.346]  I have some family members that sometimes, like a waiter or something happens to be Hispanic, and they'll start talking like,
[00:53:02.159 --> 00:53:03.479]  How are you today?
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:13.942]  It's very condescending, but it's just like Beto saying, oh, he's Beto, he's Hispanic, and trying to join some Hispanic group saying he was Hispanic, like Pocahontas says she's Native American.
[00:53:14.362 --> 00:53:15.142]  This is a joke.
[00:53:16.163 --> 00:53:17.703]  Obama is an exploiter of the poor.
[00:53:18.583 --> 00:53:20.844]  Obama loves communist China, killing its political dissidents.
[00:53:21.044 --> 00:53:22.084]  These people are monsters.
[00:53:22.944 --> 00:53:29.826]  But they phrase it all, if you're Hispanic, throw away your American birthright and join open borders so we can all be Venezuela together.
[00:53:31.653 --> 00:53:34.875]  His new name is not Joe O'Rourke.
[00:53:35.696 --> 00:53:36.416]  Not your senator.
[00:53:36.436 --> 00:53:38.738]  Even though he tried to steal the election.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.741]  That's right, Beto.
[00:53:40.881 --> 00:53:41.681]  Authentic Mexican.
[00:53:42.282 --> 00:53:43.082]  But let's get serious.
[00:53:43.122 --> 00:53:51.889]  Here's old, old reliably slimy Chuck Schumer yesterday saying everyone needs to vote.
[00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:57.773]  Implying Trump questioning famous counties that famously steal elections and have been convicted doing it.
[00:53:58.074 --> 00:53:59.895]  Now questioning an election is unpatriotic.
[00:54:00.155 --> 00:54:01.796]  You're making it up that Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:54:01.836 --> 00:54:02.237]  That's fine.
[00:54:03.697 --> 00:54:16.106]  But if it's just in general and you see real election fraud and illegals caught and people voting the names of dead people all over the country, well that's terrible and then here he is implying illegals should vote.
[00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:18.628]  But at the local level, Democrats are openly doing it.
[00:54:18.708 --> 00:54:19.048]  Here it is.
[00:54:19.748 --> 00:54:26.633]  We're going to fight for real reforms to loosen the grip of special interests in Washington and to let everybody vote.
[00:54:28.394 --> 00:54:28.875]  Everybody.
[00:54:29.983 --> 00:54:36.384]  Not stand in the way of people voting, which is a despicable, despicable thing for people to do.
[00:54:36.464 --> 00:54:38.585]  It's against the wellspring of our democracy.
[00:54:38.825 --> 00:54:39.205]  Pause again.
[00:54:39.845 --> 00:54:41.705]  How evil does Chuckie Schumer look?
[00:54:41.725 --> 00:54:49.807]  I mean, if I was going to cast somebody for a Hollywood movie that's like an evil wizard that, you know, kidnaps and drinks kids' blood or something, I mean, it'd be Chuckie Schumer.
[00:54:49.827 --> 00:54:56.008]  I mean, if I wanted somebody to be like the evil wizard that fights Gandalf, I would definitely get him, man.
[00:54:56.028 --> 00:54:59.029]  I mean, he is just a slimy, nasty liar.
[00:55:01.923 --> 00:55:05.366]  And now notice, three of the five Kavanaugh women admit they all made it up.
[00:55:05.746 --> 00:55:06.707]  Democrats all knew that.
[00:55:06.767 --> 00:55:08.709]  There's nothing they won't do.
[00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:12.752]  And criminals never stop until they're brought to justice.
[00:55:16.843 --> 00:55:17.283]  You heard him.
[00:55:17.844 --> 00:55:18.524]  And he goes on.
[00:55:19.124 --> 00:55:19.765]  Everybody vote.
[00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:21.025]  I mean everybody.
[00:55:21.045 --> 00:55:24.807]  That is a clear signal that we are going to have illegal aliens vote.
[00:55:24.867 --> 00:55:26.248]  We are stealing the election.
[00:55:26.328 --> 00:55:27.429]  And of course, they are.
[00:55:27.809 --> 00:55:28.729]  And it needs to be reversed.
[00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:34.632]  It needs to be investigated or you're green lighting Hillary to run again and steal the election from President Trump in two years.
[00:55:35.033 --> 00:55:38.194]  Guaranteed, just like the sun came up this morning, you better believe it.
[00:55:38.274 --> 00:55:39.015]  You better know it.
[00:55:40.676 --> 00:55:40.956]  All right.
[00:55:40.976 --> 00:55:43.137]  We're going to go to break.
[00:55:43.397 --> 00:55:44.017]  I'm going to come back.
[00:55:44.037 --> 00:55:44.978]  I'm going to get into
[00:55:47.162 --> 00:55:52.485]  The creepy porn lawyer for Horseface getting arrested for reportedly beating living snot out of his ex-wife in front of people.
[00:55:54.627 --> 00:55:58.989]  We're also going to get into Trump tears into Mueller investigation, calls Russia probe absolutely nuts.
[00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:04.713]  We're going to get into officials to close some northern lanes again for the huge caravan that is about to slam in.
[00:56:04.853 --> 00:56:07.134]  The Brexit betrayal has happened.
[00:56:07.454 --> 00:56:11.357]  Paul Watson is up on Parliament inside right now.
[00:56:11.397 --> 00:56:12.217]  He's part of UKIP.
[00:56:12.878 --> 00:56:14.659]  In the battle, a bunch of people have resigned.
[00:56:15.859 --> 00:56:23.143]  Our government may fall, and Paul Watson is not just a reporter, he is involved in the machinery of UKIP, and we'll just leave it at that.
[00:56:24.084 --> 00:56:28.126]  So, a lot of things happening right now.
[00:56:28.166 --> 00:56:32.129]  Paul should be joining us either today or tomorrow, but a lot of big things on that front.
[00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.872]  Also, the private Federal Reserve trying to sabotage the economy.
[00:56:38.893 --> 00:56:45.257]  Trump's threatening to throw all the press out of the White House to exercise his executive authority, which is totally righteous.
[00:56:46.738 --> 00:56:49.703]  This federal judge may rule against him if the sky is blue, but it doesn't matter.
[00:56:50.424 --> 00:56:54.431]  Because when it goes to the Supreme Court, they'll say, of course, the president doesn't have to talk to the press if he doesn't want to.
[00:56:54.451 --> 00:56:56.715]  That's not an attack on the press.
[00:56:58.382 --> 00:57:08.569]  Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we have the best deal we've ever offered on the highest quality stainless steel gravity-fed filter, Alexa Pure Pro, the biggest, nicest one.
[00:57:08.949 --> 00:57:10.270]  They've got leading competitors for $350.
[00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:18.916]  They're normally $249, but they bought too many and they don't have to pay the tax on inventory, so they're selling them to us at cost.
[00:57:19.857 --> 00:57:22.599]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, they're selling those for like $95.
[00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:23.640]  We're selling it for $127.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.081]  There's never been a deal this good.
[00:57:26.201 --> 00:57:26.742]  Get it today.
[00:57:30.782 --> 00:57:31.983]  We've gotten a lot of phone calls.
[00:57:32.944 --> 00:57:36.486]  I've seen some comments, even though it's gotten five-star reviews at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:57:37.106 --> 00:57:38.107]  The people are confused.
[00:57:38.127 --> 00:57:43.731]  They're like, X3 shows a little bit less iodine on the back than X2.
[00:57:44.211 --> 00:57:48.795]  Well, that's because the latest statements by the FDA is they think it should be lower.
[00:57:48.895 --> 00:57:50.556]  And they're going to lower stuff down to 0 cents.
[00:57:50.896 --> 00:57:56.380]  But just to play ball with all the baloney, we have a lower dose that you're supposed to take.
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:01.224]  Whatever you think or whatever your physician thinks is best for you, you do that, you judge it, okay?
[00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:05.307]  I could easily call it X3 when you reformulate and have it be the exact same formula.
[00:58:05.367 --> 00:58:09.050]  This is a new formula because we believe it is the best.
[00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:11.392]  That's what we've done with X3.
[00:58:11.572 --> 00:58:12.813]  It's extremely pure.
[00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:15.875]  All three types of iodine that are in it are extremely pure.
[00:58:16.095 --> 00:58:22.961]  It has the atomic iodine, it has the other two types of iodine in it, and it has a tiny bit of vitamin C that keeps it from oxidizing.
[00:58:23.921 --> 00:58:26.143]  It would be black if it didn't have that in there.
[00:58:26.183 --> 00:58:27.224]  It's so pure and so strong.
[00:58:27.404 --> 00:58:28.705]  Because that's the oxidization.
[00:58:28.785 --> 00:58:35.671]  Instead, it's like this beautiful orange glowing color that turns blue on paper, which is the atomic color of iodine.
[00:58:35.691 --> 00:58:37.512]  Kind of a blue-purplish crystal color.
[00:58:37.552 --> 00:58:42.436]  So Survival Shield X3 is, from our research, the very best iodine you can get.
[00:58:42.456 --> 00:58:42.476]  X3.
[00:58:43.517 --> 00:58:46.798]  It's 50% off, but the sale's only going for another 5-6 days.
[00:58:46.978 --> 00:58:52.099]  So you can get your X3, 50% off and with free shipping, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:58:52.179 --> 00:58:54.780]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, you can get X2 still.
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:56.420]  Our last big order of it's huge.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.921]  It'll probably be a long time until we can get more.
[00:58:57.941 --> 00:58:58.741]  We have to put a new order in.
[00:58:58.761 --> 00:58:59.281]  It takes time.
[00:58:59.401 --> 00:59:03.142]  But if people want X2, we'll remanufacture X2 for you all day long.
[00:59:03.562 --> 00:59:05.542]  X3 is better, in my view.
[00:59:05.782 --> 00:59:07.003]  But different strokes for different folks.
[00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:11.944]  And I forget to take my daily dose every day, a lot of times, and then I really feel it later.
[00:59:12.364 --> 00:59:14.825]  Stamina, libido, energy, it really is magic.
[00:59:15.265 --> 00:59:19.547]  And that's why there's this whole iodine conspiracy of giving you bad halogens, not the good halogen.
[00:59:19.667 --> 00:59:23.249]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple A, 2533139.
[00:59:23.549 --> 00:59:24.789]  It's at infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:30.071 --> 00:59:35.994]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:42.644]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:59:43.384 --> 00:59:48.846]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.136 --> 01:00:20.197]  You know, I tend to do research for the broadcast, and they get so wound up before I go on air that I just go in a hundred directions.
[01:00:21.057 --> 01:00:24.518]  A lot of times the first hour, but I start settling down at the second and third hour.
[01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:40.081]  And when we come back, I want to open the phones up too, just in general, to discuss the election fraud and what do you think the president should do, what should we do when brazenly Democrats all across the country
[01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:51.931]  In famous counties who've been convicted for fraud, the same individuals are involved and they're doing it in front of the whole world nakedly.
[01:00:52.512 --> 01:01:02.295]  What do we do when we're faced with criminal activity that is stealing control of our nation so they can carry out even bigger enterprises?
[01:01:05.936 --> 01:01:07.777]  What do you do with Debbie Washerman Schultz
[01:01:11.656 --> 01:01:18.999]  And people like this, known for their criminal activity, are willing to carry this out.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:28.724]  And all it's doing is making them more brazen, more arrogant, more full of chutzpah.
[01:01:31.745 --> 01:01:33.106]  How do you counter something like this?
[01:01:33.146 --> 01:01:35.527]  And what does the President need to do?
[01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.107]  That's the question I'm asking you.
[01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:38.028]  I'm going to give the number out.
[01:01:40.111 --> 01:01:40.311]  877-789-2539.
[01:01:40.351 --> 01:01:44.675]  Let's do first-time callers.
[01:01:44.695 --> 01:01:45.535]  877-789-2539.
[01:01:45.555 --> 01:01:46.616]  877-789-Alex.
[01:01:46.896 --> 01:01:57.805]  Also, when we come back, I played part of this at the very start of the show, but I'm going to play all six minutes of it because it's really powerful.
[01:01:57.825 --> 01:02:09.774]  Tucker Carlson goes to bat for InfoWars last night, and he went to bat for his own children's free speech and the future of this country, and just points out
[01:02:11.363 --> 01:02:12.443]  It's not hypocrisy.
[01:02:13.524 --> 01:02:15.284]  Because CNN's not being censored.
[01:02:16.224 --> 01:02:18.985]  So they lie and say they're being censored when they're not by the President and others.
[01:02:19.385 --> 01:02:22.986]  They act like they're the bastion of defending it, when they're the ones that are really attacking.
[01:02:25.947 --> 01:02:27.467]  Article's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:28.587]  It's very important to share it.
[01:02:28.647 --> 01:02:29.887]  If you don't share it, nobody will.
[01:02:29.908 --> 01:02:31.308]  It's also on NewsWars.com.
[01:02:31.628 --> 01:02:33.868]  Tucker Carlson's epic takedown of CNN.
[01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.409]  One of free speech's greatest enemies.
[01:02:37.469 --> 01:02:39.830]  So that's, that's the start.
[01:02:41.121 --> 01:02:41.762]  I don't think so.
[01:02:54.952 --> 01:02:56.553]  And it's just all lies.
[01:02:57.133 --> 01:03:15.642]  And I was watching Tucker Carlson this morning from last night, and while he was talking about, and his guest was talking about, all the horrible things that the Democrats and Obama and CNN has done to the free press, arresting reporters, you name it, it was making me think of all these other things they didn't even get to.
[01:03:18.563 --> 01:03:21.865]  I mean, they have done a lot of really, really horrible stuff.
[01:03:25.171 --> 01:03:32.015]  And it was making me sick to my stomach when I was listening to it this morning, and literally, Carlson then goes, it makes you nauseated.
[01:03:34.036 --> 01:03:43.161]  Because when you know all this stuff, and you know all their lies, and I heard Carlson reminding everybody of the chain of lies with his guest, it really is.
[01:03:43.181 --> 01:03:53.227]  I was getting nauseated and getting a headache, because it's just thinking about all the crap they've done, and then they've got the guts, the bravado,
[01:03:59.249 --> 01:04:00.250]  Guts isn't even a word.
[01:04:02.732 --> 01:04:06.235]  They've just got no respect for anybody.
[01:04:07.656 --> 01:04:16.383]  And they sit there and they tell the most fantastic lies you've ever seen that are verifiably not true when they're saying them.
[01:04:16.403 --> 01:04:18.525]  This is called gaslighting.
[01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:19.826]  And it really makes me angry.
[01:04:20.762 --> 01:04:32.830]  When we come back, we're gonna play the report and tie it in to CNN bitching and complaining that they're being censored by Trump, which again is another lie.
[01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:34.010]  They're the censors.
[01:04:34.491 --> 01:04:35.391]  They're the pigs.
[01:04:35.751 --> 01:04:36.512]  They're the liars.
[01:04:38.973 --> 01:04:39.454]  Look at that.
[01:04:39.474 --> 01:04:44.517]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[01:04:44.797 --> 01:04:45.598]  We didn't do that.
[01:04:47.214 --> 01:04:51.338]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that isn't the very best I can get?
[01:04:51.778 --> 01:04:53.420]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:05:02.548]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:05:03.028 --> 01:05:04.729]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:05:04.769 --> 01:05:05.870]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:05:06.551 --> 01:05:09.053]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:05:09.113 --> 01:05:10.214]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:05:10.995 --> 01:05:13.817]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:21.284]  Liquid Consciousness.
[01:05:21.444 --> 01:05:21.825]  Look it up.
[01:05:22.926 --> 01:05:23.446]  Find out.
[01:05:23.466 --> 01:05:28.931]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[01:05:28.971 --> 01:05:33.836]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[01:05:34.316 --> 01:05:37.038]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4store.com.
[01:05:52.288 --> 01:05:55.309]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:58.251]  Run on for a long time.
[01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:01.052]  Run on for a long time.
[01:06:01.732 --> 01:06:04.153]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:06:04.713 --> 01:06:07.254]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:06:09.335 --> 01:06:14.297]  Go tell that long-tongued liar... We are now into the second hour
[01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:22.195]  Of the global broadcast, the most censored, most demonized, most lied about transmission in the world, for good reason.
[01:06:22.255 --> 01:06:27.767]  We've got the globalist number, we know they're in-game, we know how they operate, we know how to stop them.
[01:06:29.775 --> 01:06:32.477]  So again, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:06:32.657 --> 01:06:33.697]  until 3 p.m.
[01:06:33.737 --> 01:06:34.017]  Central.
[01:06:34.037 --> 01:06:36.639]  We're here at the War Room with Owen Schroer and others.
[01:06:36.699 --> 01:06:39.120]  Comes up 3 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.140]  David Knight, 8 a.m.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:40.480]  Central.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:45.123]  And remember, we're on hundreds of AM and FM stations, hundreds of TV stations and cable stations.
[01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:48.284]  However you're watching or listening, you are the power of free speech.
[01:06:48.744 --> 01:06:52.826]  You are the power of getting the word out to everyone you know.
[01:06:53.246 --> 01:06:58.429]  You are the ones that are overpowering the censors and big tech's attempt to silence us.
[01:07:01.161 --> 01:07:12.246]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, where you can subscribe to the free podcast, where you can find all the special live events, where you can find all the special video feeds, affiliate pages, and so much more.
[01:07:12.646 --> 01:07:16.088]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:07:16.988 --> 01:07:18.729]  And I want to thank you all for spreading the word.
[01:07:19.129 --> 01:07:23.051]  Despite their attempts to destroy us and shut us down, they have failed so far.
[01:07:23.451 --> 01:07:24.772]  Thank you for standing with us.
[01:07:25.717 --> 01:07:31.801]  And I want to say thank you to Tucker Carlson for standing with the First Amendment and his birthright and your birthright.
[01:07:33.102 --> 01:07:38.826]  He's been the strongest in any mainstream media format to defend free speech.
[01:07:38.886 --> 01:07:40.047]  Michael Savage has as well.
[01:07:40.647 --> 01:07:45.911]  Matt Drudge has online been a powerful force for free speech.
[01:07:47.372 --> 01:07:53.937]  And he also predicted years ago in the studio in an exclusive interview what was coming in the future because he was told by members of the Supreme Court and others.
[01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:56.290]  We're now witnessing that endgame.
[01:07:56.791 --> 01:07:59.151]  They were going to carry out whether Hillary got elected or not.
[01:08:00.311 --> 01:08:07.873]  They're going to have hearings in January claiming that Trump has violated the rights of the Washington Post and CNN and is trying to destroy the First Amendment.
[01:08:08.093 --> 01:08:08.874]  None of that's happening.
[01:08:09.114 --> 01:08:14.915]  He's speaking out when they lie about him and say he's a Nazi or all these other horrible names.
[01:08:15.755 --> 01:08:22.417]  They're now claiming countering them is a violation of their free speech.
[01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:33.917]  They're now suing the president in federal court, saying that Jim Acosta did not touch a woman and that Trump has no right to kick him out because of his heckling and violating decorum.
[01:08:34.357 --> 01:08:36.018]  Anybody else would be thrown out acting like this.
[01:08:36.419 --> 01:08:40.602]  CNN lobbied last year to have us removed, and it was done.
[01:08:41.843 --> 01:08:51.512]  CNN put pressure on the press secretary, gave him a big national story, and so our press passes were revoked, no reason given.
[01:08:52.907 --> 01:08:54.208]  Dr. Corsi was our reporter there.
[01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:56.610]  Two number one New York Times bestselling books.
[01:08:58.432 --> 01:09:01.094]  PhD in political science and international finance.
[01:09:03.396 --> 01:09:05.637]  And they said, CNN says you should not have it.
[01:09:06.878 --> 01:09:08.480]  And so you're taken off the air.
[01:09:10.512 --> 01:09:26.660]  So this is their attitude, this is what they're doing, and now they're the paragon of free speech defense when they lobbied and harassed our sponsors and mercilessly lied and went after publishing companies and got one of the head publisher guys fired because they were trying to do a book deal with me.
[01:09:28.908 --> 01:09:34.110]  It's just, they are true authoritarians, and then their little attack dog gets thrown out, lies about it.
[01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:43.294]  The whole press joins him, including Fox News Corp itself, joined the lawsuit against the president, saying, you will let Jim Acosta run around and scream and yell at everyone.
[01:09:44.094 --> 01:09:46.175]  And you will let him stay in there and manhandle women.
[01:09:47.403 --> 01:09:48.183]  And you have no right.
[01:09:48.224 --> 01:09:53.146]  Well, Trump knows this judge may say, yes, the cost is God, but the Supreme Court will shoot it down.
[01:09:53.547 --> 01:09:56.368]  Just like the Supreme Court said, no, the president does control the borders.
[01:09:56.788 --> 01:10:04.273]  Oh, and that caravan started arriving in San Diego, wanting all the free goods, and taunting the military and Border Patrol yesterday.
[01:10:04.613 --> 01:10:05.934]  Oh, but it didn't exist, remember?
[01:10:07.233 --> 01:10:10.700]  First it existed, but when we didn't want it, they said, oh it doesn't exist, you're crazy.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.203]  This is the level of deception.
[01:10:12.423 --> 01:10:17.874]  So here's Tucker Carlson last night, going to bat for all of our basic free speech, and going to bat for reality.
[01:10:19.068 --> 01:10:22.290]  Well, there's a battle over free speech going on in Washington right now.
[01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.750]  Good.
[01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:24.350]  We're for free speech.
[01:10:24.611 --> 01:10:31.154]  The question is, are the people who claim they're defending free speech actually defenders of speech?
[01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:32.734]  Hashtag Basta.
[01:10:33.034 --> 01:10:34.435]  Whatever that means.
[01:10:34.475 --> 01:10:37.356]  We'll investigate the assault on free speech after the break.
[01:10:43.299 --> 01:10:45.380]  In the past couple of days, you've heard a lot of huffing and puffing
[01:10:48.131 --> 01:10:48.451]  We're good to go.
[01:11:10.212 --> 01:11:12.354]  So we know who's for free speech and who's against it.
[01:11:12.514 --> 01:11:19.580]  And we cannot help but notice that some of free speech's greatest enemies are now posing as its defenders, all of a sudden.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.261]  Take CNN, for example.
[01:11:21.982 --> 01:11:30.969]  It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the Internet on the grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say.
[01:11:31.629 --> 01:11:33.811]  Ultimately, CNN succeeded in doing that.
[01:11:33.891 --> 01:11:38.595]  The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones and his outlet, InfoWars.
[01:11:39.235 --> 01:11:45.519]  You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying loss for free speech, because it was exactly that.
[01:11:46.339 --> 01:11:48.841]  But CNN was not done trying to silence its critics.
[01:11:48.921 --> 01:11:54.144]  Last year, the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for creating an anti-CNN meme.
[01:11:54.644 --> 01:12:00.068]  CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin his life if it ever was criticized by him again.
[01:12:00.828 --> 01:12:05.232]  Now, CNN is claiming to defend free speech, only when it's their speech.
[01:12:05.652 --> 01:12:13.418]  You'll notice, by the way, that CNN did not object when the government threatened to imprison employees of the cable channel RT if they didn't register as foreign agents.
[01:12:13.859 --> 01:12:16.261]  Yes, RT is owned by a foreign government.
[01:12:16.681 --> 01:12:17.582]  So is the BBC.
[01:12:18.283 --> 01:12:21.225]  Until last year, much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign national.
[01:12:21.365 --> 01:12:25.990]  This is true of other news organizations, none of which has ever registered as a foreign agent.
[01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:34.339]  But because RT is owned by Russia, which the left believes got Donald Trump elected, it is fine with CNN if they are bullied and silenced.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:39.365]  So call CNN what you will, but don't pretend they are defenders of the First Amendment.
[01:12:39.465 --> 01:12:40.005]  They are not.
[01:12:40.766 --> 01:12:45.127]  Victor Davis Hanson is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a close watcher of all as he joins us tonight.
[01:12:45.587 --> 01:12:48.568]  So I just want to be clear, we're always for free speech.
[01:12:48.848 --> 01:12:53.490]  Especially speech that's offensive, even by obnoxious White House correspondents.
[01:12:53.850 --> 01:13:00.732]  But to see a channel that has lobbied against the right of others to say what they think is true, to all of a sudden emerge as this defender of the first amendment is nauseating.
[01:13:01.172 --> 01:13:08.841]  Yeah, I think when people saw the suit, they asked themselves, was there anything in the past that Jim Acosta had said negatively that got him kicked out?
[01:13:08.861 --> 01:13:09.662]  And the answer was no.
[01:13:09.702 --> 01:13:12.305]  Is there anybody, MSNBC, do they get kicked out?
[01:13:12.325 --> 01:13:13.026]  The answer is no.
[01:13:13.506 --> 01:13:15.869]  Do other CNN reporters get kicked out?
[01:13:15.889 --> 01:13:16.770]  No, they have passes.
[01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:19.353]  So, it was a particular type of behavior.
[01:13:20.273 --> 01:13:26.776]  I mean, if you're arguing a case before the Supreme Court, you can't go in there and take pictures or interrupt the justice.
[01:13:26.816 --> 01:13:31.717]  They'll kick you out, and if you do it another time, they'll say, we don't want you pleading a case before the Supreme Court.
[01:13:32.638 --> 01:13:35.679]  Jim Costa can't go in there barefooted and say, I want to express myself.
[01:13:35.819 --> 01:13:39.582]  There are certain protocols and norms of behavior and he's violated them.
[01:13:40.042 --> 01:13:43.905]  That's one issue and then it's not... This is sort of a psychodrama, Tucker.
[01:13:43.945 --> 01:13:50.751]  I mean, remember that the prior administration monitored 20 AP reporters and Fox's own James Rosen.
[01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:53.773]  Nobody filed a suit on behalf of James Rosen from CNN.
[01:13:53.913 --> 01:13:55.775]  Thanks.
[01:13:56.795 --> 01:14:05.042]  Yeah, they prosecuted hundreds of journalists and whistleblowers at a level worse than Abraham Lincoln did in a war.
[01:14:07.674 --> 01:14:18.723]  He broke Abraham Lincoln's records using Trading with the Enemy Act on people reporting on Obama's corruption and working with the Taliban and groups like that.
[01:14:19.883 --> 01:14:29.531]  They tried to put Fox News reporters in jail for reporting on North Korea and public info and going to defense briefings that were public at the Pentagon.
[01:14:29.791 --> 01:14:37.237]  And then they tried to put multiple Fox reporters in prison for going to public defense talks
[01:14:39.557 --> 01:14:40.578]  Oh, but oh, the press!
[01:14:40.718 --> 01:14:41.819]  Oh, Trump's getting it!
[01:14:42.159 --> 01:14:46.883]  Oh, he's... Remember when they went to the older lady's house who is a listener but didn't want to come on?
[01:14:46.903 --> 01:14:53.189]  And they said, your Facebook's got a couple hundred people on it here in Broward County that don't want anybody voting there against them.
[01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:54.850]  You're a Russian agent!
[01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:56.351]  She goes, I know every person on there.
[01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:58.953]  Well, a Russian bot posted something on there.
[01:14:59.314 --> 01:15:00.795]  Oh, a Russian bot sent a link.
[01:15:01.355 --> 01:15:06.640]  Turned out 80% of the Russian bots were hired by the Democrats, because you can go hire Russian companies to spam.
[01:15:08.507 --> 01:15:11.048]  We're gonna come back and play a little bit more of this, but this is just crazy.
[01:15:11.388 --> 01:15:13.749]  And play that clip, reminding everybody they're bullying.
[01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:17.031]  But this guy's really smart, Victor Davis.
[01:15:18.111 --> 01:15:18.472]  Handsome.
[01:15:18.872 --> 01:15:20.713]  He rattles off a bunch of stuff I've forgotten about.
[01:15:21.193 --> 01:15:28.936]  And it's just like, it'd be like Hitler being the chief judge at Nuremberg and passing judgment on Nazis that followed his orders.
[01:15:29.016 --> 01:15:32.178]  I mean, CNN is the most anti-free speech group in the world.
[01:15:32.378 --> 01:15:35.239]  They are anti-American, filthy criminals.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:36.540]  They're sick!
[01:15:37.912 --> 01:15:42.160]  There's only four days left at InfoWareStore.com on one of the biggest sales we've ever had.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:46.728]  67% off, blowout sale, and free shipping storewide.
[01:15:54.324 --> 01:15:59.106]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[01:15:59.126 --> 01:16:16.131]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[01:16:16.592 --> 01:16:17.252]  But is it true?
[01:16:18.172 --> 01:16:24.639]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.063]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:31.546]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[01:16:32.495 --> 01:16:35.817]  So the establishment wants us off the air at any cost.
[01:16:35.837 --> 01:16:38.859]  Because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming.
[01:16:38.879 --> 01:16:40.640]  Live every day from 11 a.m.
[01:16:41.021 --> 01:16:41.461]  to 3 p.m.
[01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:42.422]  just on my show.
[01:16:42.702 --> 01:16:45.123]  You got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[01:16:45.163 --> 01:16:45.484]  Central.
[01:16:45.944 --> 01:16:49.346]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:16:49.406 --> 01:16:50.007]  in the War Room.
[01:16:50.047 --> 01:16:52.248]  We're trying to expand it to at least 20 hours a day.
[01:16:52.688 --> 01:16:53.429]  They're trying to block that.
[01:16:54.332 --> 01:16:58.115]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[01:16:58.796 --> 01:17:05.842]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[01:17:06.442 --> 01:17:08.944]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[01:17:09.745 --> 01:17:24.623]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers, not let us advertise online, kick us off PayPal, kick us off Facebook, kick us off Twitter, kick us off YouTube, and over a hundred other platforms now, where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[01:17:25.203 --> 01:17:33.249]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[01:17:33.309 --> 01:17:35.351]  That's because we are on target.
[01:17:35.411 --> 01:17:37.552]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[01:17:37.592 --> 01:17:39.474]  We're exposing their main operation.
[01:17:39.834 --> 01:17:41.615]  And look, I know you guys know that.
[01:17:42.035 --> 01:17:42.896]  That's why you've supported us.
[01:17:42.936 --> 01:17:49.061]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:17:50.262 --> 01:17:52.204]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[01:17:52.224 --> 01:18:02.474]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, and when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[01:18:02.814 --> 01:18:03.915]  To hand-share those links.
[01:18:03.935 --> 01:18:05.537]  To text message people.
[01:18:05.877 --> 01:18:07.958]  Information you think is particularly important.
[01:18:07.998 --> 01:18:09.319]  To get around the censors.
[01:18:09.359 --> 01:18:10.680]  Nothing can stop your word of mouth.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.782]  And yes, to financially support MFORCE.
[01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:17.803]  And we make it easy to support MFORCE.
[01:18:17.863 --> 01:18:26.548]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[01:18:26.588 --> 01:18:29.750]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:31.951]  They're all there at MFORCEstore.com.
[01:18:31.991 --> 01:18:32.591]  Patriot apparel.
[01:18:33.272 --> 01:18:33.732]  It's all there.
[01:18:35.029 --> 01:18:47.495]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:47.595 --> 01:19:00.181]  And we already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[01:19:01.161 --> 01:19:04.104]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[01:19:04.504 --> 01:19:08.909]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[01:19:08.949 --> 01:19:15.795]  So please take advantage of them today at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:16.196 --> 01:19:17.557]  Everybody loves Rainforest.
[01:19:17.577 --> 01:19:18.998]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[01:19:19.439 --> 01:19:19.759]  50% off.
[01:19:19.999 --> 01:19:21.601]  Everybody really loves our Coil Silver.
[01:19:21.801 --> 01:19:23.423]  Highest quality, 67% off, silver bullet.
[01:19:24.904 --> 01:19:30.628]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:31.288 --> 01:19:37.332]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[01:19:41.916 --> 01:19:44.557]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:53.377 --> 01:20:03.686]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:20:04.447 --> 01:20:06.368]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:16.367 --> 01:20:25.775]  You know, CNN didn't just dox a man that made a funny meme of CNN's head on top of a wrestler that Trump was wrestling.
[01:20:26.396 --> 01:20:29.919]  They didn't just threaten to fire him and get him to lose his job by doxing him.
[01:20:30.499 --> 01:20:36.064]  They would go to people's houses and accuse them of being Russian agents because they were getting people organized in Florida to vote.
[01:20:36.304 --> 01:20:37.105]  Remember this video?
[01:20:37.385 --> 01:20:38.306]  This real harassment?
[01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:41.726]  The Russians?
[01:20:41.926 --> 01:20:47.951]  I don't care if they were involved or not, that to me is the least important thing.
[01:20:47.971 --> 01:20:49.532]  But they were involved with you.
[01:20:50.052 --> 01:20:51.033]  Did you guys know that?
[01:20:52.234 --> 01:20:53.715]  They weren't involved with us.
[01:20:53.795 --> 01:21:00.019]  You know, just make sure that you report it correctly, that, you know... But you guys were involved with Being Patriotic, right?
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:08.806]  Very, very patriotic, but not... Being Patriotic was the group that contacted and helped organize some of these activities that you posted on your own Facebook account.
[01:21:09.961 --> 01:21:11.122]  Those were legitimate.
[01:21:11.482 --> 01:21:12.363]  Those were Russians.
[01:21:12.924 --> 01:21:13.945]  They were not Russians.
[01:21:14.005 --> 01:21:15.506]  I don't go with the Russians.
[01:21:15.686 --> 01:21:17.688]  That group was Russians.
[01:21:17.768 --> 01:21:19.469]  I have nothing to do with the Russians.
[01:21:19.529 --> 01:21:20.850]  Well, apparently you did.
[01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:21.711]  No.
[01:21:22.011 --> 01:21:23.993]  Maybe you didn't know it, but you did.
[01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:27.376]  When you're talking like this, I don't want to have anything to do with you.
[01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:32.420]  Those people that were with me were all Trump supporters.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:34.462]  Very, very much so.
[01:21:34.702 --> 01:21:36.724]  And all apparently following the direction
[01:21:37.504 --> 01:21:42.406]  Of groups that were associated with Russians who were actually infiltrated.
[01:21:42.626 --> 01:21:42.746]  B.S.
[01:21:42.786 --> 01:21:42.906]  B.S.
[01:21:42.946 --> 01:21:45.006]  And please, please report that.
[01:21:45.126 --> 01:21:46.027]  I don't believe that.
[01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:46.787]  That's bullshit.
[01:21:46.887 --> 01:21:49.248]  I know all the people that were with me, okay?
[01:21:49.748 --> 01:21:50.988]  They were at my meetings.
[01:21:51.088 --> 01:21:53.909]  They're all Trump supporters, okay?
[01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:54.549]  Mm-hmm.
[01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:59.950]  But did you realize that you guys were in communication electronically with Russians?
[01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:00.210]  Not me.
[01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:00.930]  Not me.
[01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:01.250]  I don't know.
[01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:03.071]  You were posting stuff on the Facebook.
[01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:07.592]  Hillary Clinton was, and so was all her bandits.
[01:22:08.092 --> 01:22:11.192]  Some of the stuff that you... You were in charge of the Facebook account, right?
[01:22:11.353 --> 01:22:20.754]  You were posting and reposting almost word-for-word the information that was coming out of this internet research agency in St.
[01:22:20.814 --> 01:22:21.355]  Petersburg.
[01:22:21.535 --> 01:22:21.755]  No.
[01:22:21.835 --> 01:22:22.595]  You don't believe that?
[01:22:23.195 --> 01:22:23.395]  Nope.
[01:22:26.711 --> 01:22:29.493]  Thank you!
[01:22:29.593 --> 01:22:30.693]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:22:30.733 --> 01:22:31.594]  There's the American flag.
[01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:34.075]  They go show her address, her name, where she lives.
[01:22:35.796 --> 01:22:37.176]  And it turned out, of course, none of that was true.
[01:22:37.216 --> 01:22:42.939]  The Internet Research Agency is really a Western intelligence front interfacing with Russia.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:46.941]  They put billions in a year trying to overthrow Russia through these different projects.
[01:22:47.502 --> 01:22:49.263]  Soros has huge operations in Russia.
[01:22:49.363 --> 01:22:55.906]  Then they'll point at those, almost all of it supporting Hillary, and then come back and say that then Russians are involved.
[01:22:56.647 --> 01:23:01.550]  That's like saying Americans are involved in Russia, or Japanese are involved in America.
[01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:02.550]  Russia's huge.
[01:23:02.891 --> 01:23:04.612]  There's all these businesses going back and forth.
[01:23:05.212 --> 01:23:15.838]  The truth is, 80% of campaign spending that went on with any Russian companies was against Donald J. Trump, because 80% of the campaign money got spent by Hillary.
[01:23:17.822 --> 01:23:19.543]  Simply mind-blowing.
[01:23:20.023 --> 01:23:21.884]  And again, we now know the Russia thing was made up.
[01:23:21.924 --> 01:23:22.704]  We knew it at the time.
[01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:23.965]  It was all a canard.
[01:23:24.525 --> 01:23:28.627]  A red herring to cover up what Hillary and Mueller and the rest of them were involved in.
[01:23:28.647 --> 01:23:29.987]  But there's the real doxxing.
[01:23:30.367 --> 01:23:31.368]  There's the real harassment.
[01:23:31.508 --> 01:23:32.548]  Everything they accused me of.
[01:23:32.808 --> 01:23:39.571]  They said I was talked to a CNN reporter rudely and said he was a horrible person for getting his band off all those platforms.
[01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:40.431]  Which was true!
[01:23:40.812 --> 01:23:42.532]  He's a public figure in a public space.
[01:23:43.093 --> 01:23:43.853]  I was talking to him.
[01:23:47.819 --> 01:23:48.479]  Oliver Darcy.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.720]  They go, that's why you're banned.
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.961]  You talk to the Royal CNN.
[01:23:53.181 --> 01:23:57.903]  But they can go harass a woman in her house and accuse her of being a Russian, which turned out wasn't even true.
[01:23:58.643 --> 01:24:02.385]  Here's Tucker Carlson breaking it down with an expert from the Hoover Institute.
[01:24:03.644 --> 01:24:09.669]  My God, we only learned in 2013 that three years ago the man was being surveilled by the Attorney General.
[01:24:09.729 --> 01:24:11.310]  This is a violation of press freedom.
[01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:12.031]  We didn't hear that.
[01:24:12.111 --> 01:24:20.839]  And you're not hearing CNN say anything about the voices being silenced now online by the big tech companies because they have unfashionable views.
[01:24:21.439 --> 01:24:26.524]  Can you, as a philosophical matter, support free speech in some cases but not in others?
[01:24:26.984 --> 01:24:28.766]  I don't think you can and then we get to another
[01:24:29.786 --> 01:24:37.889]  If we want to talk about ethics and the protocols of the White House, CNN, 93% of their coverage, according to Shorenstein, is biased.
[01:24:37.909 --> 01:24:39.310]  And Trump had no problem with that.
[01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:44.872]  He has no problem when a CNN host, Kathy Griffin, holds a decapitated facsimile of his head.
[01:24:44.912 --> 01:24:54.355]  They have no problem when Anderson Cooper uses obscenity, or Reza Aslan says he's a piece of crap, or people that are guests and panelists say that he's a
[01:24:55.055 --> 01:25:03.182]  Russian asset or agent, or they invoke the Holocaust for comparison, or people say that he's radicalized more people than ISIS, remember that?
[01:25:03.762 --> 01:25:10.308]  And they have these stories that keep running, you know, that Scaramucci is involved with a Russian hedge fund, false.
[01:25:11.008 --> 01:25:15.732]  That Trump knew in advance of the Russian meeting that Donald Trump Jr.
[01:25:15.752 --> 01:25:17.734]  had access to the Wikileaks.
[01:25:17.794 --> 01:25:23.298]  I remember when CNN was just explaining to us, as a matter of fact... He never gets to this.
[01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:24.499]  There's just so many hundreds of other ones.
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:28.523]  When CNN and ABC said, General Flynn admits they were under Russian command.
[01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:29.724]  Unbelievable!
[01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:31.625]  Joy Behard, we've got the documents!
[01:25:31.806 --> 01:25:33.227]  They're a Russian operation!
[01:25:33.247 --> 01:25:34.268]  He's pled guilty!
[01:25:34.288 --> 01:25:35.188]  They're Russian agents!
[01:25:35.228 --> 01:25:36.630]  The Russians commanded them all!
[01:25:37.718 --> 01:25:42.740]  No, General Flynn only had about $100,000 in the bank, you know, paying for his kid's college and everything, and a modest house.
[01:25:44.341 --> 01:25:47.522]  And he lost his house and everything else, the preliminary, and said, okay, I'll plead guilty.
[01:25:48.883 --> 01:25:52.004]  You say I made misleading statements, which weren't even true, fine.
[01:25:52.824 --> 01:25:53.385]  I plead guilty.
[01:25:55.225 --> 01:25:57.306]  Which wasn't even true, but he just said, fine, I plead guilty.
[01:25:57.566 --> 01:25:58.047]  I don't have money.
[01:25:58.067 --> 01:26:01.808]  I know Roger Stone spent a million bucks.
[01:26:01.848 --> 01:26:03.909]  He's now out of the behind-the-scenes stuff, has no money.
[01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:06.250]  Spent all his money.
[01:26:07.802 --> 01:26:08.303]  Sold his house.
[01:26:09.284 --> 01:26:10.706]  Had his other place doxxed.
[01:26:11.227 --> 01:26:12.669]  This is what they do to you, folks.
[01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:19.118]  I put some acorns away for winter so I could fight these folks, but they've gone through most our acorns.
[01:26:19.818 --> 01:26:20.519]  It's a real war.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.461]  Let's go back to it.
[01:26:22.296 --> 01:26:23.917]  ...meeting that Donald Trump Jr.
[01:26:23.937 --> 01:26:25.918]  had access to the WikiLeaks.
[01:26:25.978 --> 01:26:40.084]  I remember when CNN was just explaining to us, as a matter of fact, that James Comey, within a matter of hours, was going to go into a congressional testimony and swear that Donald Trump had mischaracterized their private meeting about whether he was subject to prosecution.
[01:26:40.104 --> 01:26:42.305]  This doesn't make sense, though, because... It was all false.
[01:26:42.385 --> 01:26:47.908]  CNN has argued that others should lose their voice, should be silenced because they're, quote, conspiracy theorists.
[01:26:48.528 --> 01:26:52.191]  But you're listing conspiracy theories that they promulgated on their air.
[01:26:52.271 --> 01:26:58.835]  Yeah, and they're also arguing that their type of behavior should not be subject to public scrutiny.
[01:26:58.935 --> 01:26:59.976]  Only Donald Trump's could.
[01:27:00.036 --> 01:27:01.997]  Protocol, manners, politeness.
[01:27:02.437 --> 01:27:03.698]  And that's what Trump's argument is.
[01:27:03.758 --> 01:27:04.779]  It's not the content.
[01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:06.200]  It's not the prejudice.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.762]  It's not the unprofessionalism in the past.
[01:27:08.822 --> 01:27:15.426]  It's this particular time you went over the edge and you disrupted, you were rude, you took over an optional press conference.
[01:27:15.446 --> 01:27:18.208]  There's nothing in the Constitution that says he has to have a press conference.
[01:27:18.868 --> 01:27:21.290]  I can remember President Reagan saying, I can't hear you.
[01:27:22.031 --> 01:27:24.653]  When somebody yells to Donald Trump, he runs over and talks.
[01:27:25.233 --> 01:27:37.203]  So it's not only hypocritical on their part, but it's a journalistic organization that has violated the ethos of reporting and journalism, then calling the kettle black and saying, you can't do this.
[01:27:37.243 --> 01:27:38.824]  This is against White House protocols.
[01:27:38.924 --> 01:27:39.264]  It's a shame.
[01:27:40.405 --> 01:27:40.625]  Yeah.
[01:27:40.685 --> 01:27:42.926]  To see a buffoon elevated to murder status.
[01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:48.247]  But look, now that CNN's on the side of free speech, I'm sure they'll be advocating for the right of all people to say what they think.
[01:27:48.367 --> 01:27:53.048]  They could have sued in 2013 on behalf of Fox and the AP.
[01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:55.569]  Victor Davis Hanson, a man with a long memory.
[01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:59.230]  Man, that is the smartest show on television.
[01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:02.091]  You look at CNN, MSNBC, it's just talking points.
[01:28:02.171 --> 01:28:05.392]  And Carlson just has all these super smart people on.
[01:28:05.412 --> 01:28:09.253]  And then he has leftists on, and they can hardly talk.
[01:28:11.314 --> 01:28:13.576]  And they just lie, lie, lie.
[01:28:13.756 --> 01:28:14.857]  There is no caravan.
[01:28:15.677 --> 01:28:16.998]  There is no Soros involved.
[01:28:17.038 --> 01:28:17.619]  There is no.
[01:28:18.119 --> 01:28:18.639]  There is no.
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:23.903]  We're going to come back with Roger Stone because the whole Russian thing is coming to a head.
[01:28:24.584 --> 01:28:25.144]  What's next?
[01:28:25.164 --> 01:28:29.087]  We're going to look at Trump taking the gloves off, the election fraud, and your phone calls.
[01:28:29.448 --> 01:28:30.528]  Callers, we're going to you.
[01:28:31.049 --> 01:28:33.370]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[01:28:33.691 --> 01:28:35.112]  Tomorrow's news, today.

[01:29:37.971 --> 01:29:43.712]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed, and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[01:29:44.012 --> 01:29:48.033]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[01:29:48.473 --> 01:29:50.674]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[01:29:50.714 --> 01:29:52.834]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[01:29:53.174 --> 01:29:55.155]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[01:29:55.715 --> 01:29:55.936]  Boom!
[01:29:56.236 --> 01:29:58.478]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[01:29:58.819 --> 01:30:03.444]  Oh, but you still have a website, you still have InfoWars Store, you still have a shopfront.
[01:30:03.644 --> 01:30:04.425]  And then what do we see?
[01:30:04.726 --> 01:30:05.526]  Washington Post.
[01:30:06.027 --> 01:30:09.151]  Oh my God, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars Store has increased by 50%!
[01:30:10.532 --> 01:30:13.633]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[01:30:13.653 --> 01:30:16.495]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[01:30:16.795 --> 01:30:22.217]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:22.557 --> 01:30:29.501]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is to fund these deplatforming campaigns.
[01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:33.242]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships like CNN is.
[01:30:33.522 --> 01:30:37.004]  We're only funded by you by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:48.295]  Owen Schroer here for InfoWars.com and I want to tell you guys about a great product that we have and it is the Knockout Sleep Aid Formula.
[01:30:48.475 --> 01:30:58.359]  Now, I've got my Knockout right here and we're going to take it and we're going to look at the actual results of the Knockout Sleep Formula in real time.
[01:30:58.419 --> 01:31:01.280]  So let me take my Knockout first.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:07.262]  But while we're waiting to see the effects of the Knockout,
[01:31:11.142 --> 01:31:20.165]  I've got some very, very, very important news that I want to get to.
[01:31:20.285 --> 01:31:27.348]  InfoWarsLife wants to bring you a sleep support formula that goes above and beyond other leading brands at an affordable price.
[01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:30.909]  Get the sleep you deserve and experience the power of knockout.
[01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:35.190]  Head on over to InfoWarsLife.com and say goodbye to fatigue.
[01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:36.691]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.481]  Introducing Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[01:31:41.501 --> 01:31:46.343]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[01:31:46.504 --> 01:31:49.525]  Ultimate Bone Broth to help you save big on this new product.
[01:31:49.585 --> 01:31:52.607]  In stock up, we're dropping the price to $19.95.
[01:31:52.847 --> 01:31:58.289]  Our previous supplier was unable to get the incredible ingredients while keeping the cost low.
[01:31:58.409 --> 01:32:03.932]  Since we wanted to make sure that you got the best value possible, we've now switched to a new supplier with even better ingredients.
[01:32:04.012 --> 01:32:06.373]  That's why it's now the Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[01:32:06.433 --> 01:32:07.654]  The incredible ingredients include
[01:32:09.773 --> 01:32:17.157]  Include chicken bone broth, turmeric root, shiitake mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, and alfalfa herb powder.
[01:32:17.317 --> 01:32:18.418]  And even more, of course.
[01:32:18.558 --> 01:32:28.083]  These powerful ingredients are gonna help you get the most out of your workout by supporting your healthy muscles, digestion, tendons, and ligaments, while also supporting your body's fight against free radicals.
[01:32:28.364 --> 01:32:35.347]  It's time to take advantage and pick up your bottle of an updated favorite formula with Ultimate Bone Broth from InfoWars Life.
[01:32:35.468 --> 01:32:35.868]  Thank you!
[01:32:41.306 --> 01:32:43.930]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:05.512 --> 01:33:18.541]  You know, I'm not suicidal, I love life, but when I hear about the Russiagate stuff, I want to jump off a cliff.
[01:33:21.002 --> 01:33:27.407]  But it is coming to a head, supposedly tomorrow or the next day or sometime next week, and Roger Stone's right in the crosshairs.
[01:33:29.019 --> 01:33:33.941]  I'm literally calling Roger this morning saying, I'm sick of hearing about Russia, and then I call him back and go, actually, come on about Russia.
[01:33:34.301 --> 01:33:36.202]  Because that's really coming into view.
[01:33:36.242 --> 01:33:37.442]  He'll be with us into the next segment.
[01:33:37.802 --> 01:33:41.303]  We'll start taking some of your calls, too, on election fraud, what should Trump do.
[01:33:41.703 --> 01:33:43.144]  But I wanted to just quickly get an update.
[01:33:44.241 --> 01:33:46.902]  Because Trump really has torn into Mueller like never before.
[01:33:47.002 --> 01:33:49.183]  Today, we're going to be looking at that.
[01:33:49.564 --> 01:33:57.027]  Stone released all his text messages that Mueller's already had, proving that Randy Credico was saying he was the back channel.
[01:33:57.408 --> 01:33:58.168]  I remember!
[01:33:58.548 --> 01:33:59.489]  I could have testified.
[01:33:59.829 --> 01:34:00.469]  He wouldn't tell me.
[01:34:00.489 --> 01:34:05.612]  He said, oh, it's a talk show host in New York that knows him, and I'm going to try to see what it is.
[01:34:05.752 --> 01:34:09.774]  And by then, Assange was on TV saying it's very damning for the Democrats.
[01:34:10.594 --> 01:34:11.955]  There were investigative reports about
[01:34:13.035 --> 01:34:18.579]  John Podesta and Latin America and the Panama Papers.
[01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:22.041]  We were trying to guess here what it was.
[01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:25.803]  I never thought it was going to be devil worship and blood drinking in New York.
[01:34:25.943 --> 01:34:26.764]  Remember all that?
[01:34:28.625 --> 01:34:29.766]  We didn't know what was in there.
[01:34:30.466 --> 01:34:31.066]  Good Lord.
[01:34:31.127 --> 01:34:32.367]  I mean, I guess I should have imagined.
[01:34:32.387 --> 01:34:33.428]  We're going to go to Roger in a moment.
[01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:34.789]  But first off,
[01:34:37.532 --> 01:34:43.513]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[01:34:45.033 --> 01:34:46.594]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[01:34:46.654 --> 01:34:47.254]  It's a good thing.
[01:34:47.274 --> 01:34:50.515]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[01:34:51.595 --> 01:34:53.935]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[01:34:53.975 --> 01:34:55.115]  I learned what the best was.
[01:34:55.796 --> 01:35:02.797]  And Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there
[01:35:04.167 --> 01:35:10.091]  And took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[01:35:10.712 --> 01:35:14.695]  It's just remarkably high quality and essential.
[01:35:16.296 --> 01:35:22.120]  Now the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:27.464]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[01:35:27.964 --> 01:35:30.306]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[01:35:32.324 --> 01:35:36.701]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotsApply that have developed these filters.
[01:35:38.385 --> 01:35:40.066]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[01:35:40.827 --> 01:35:43.128]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[01:35:43.148 --> 01:35:50.553]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out, or the next year's coming, and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[01:35:50.573 --> 01:35:53.475]  $25,000 car, you probably pay $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[01:35:54.056 --> 01:35:56.077]  And that's not counting state taxes, a lot of states have.
[01:35:56.177 --> 01:35:56.998]  Texas has that too.
[01:35:57.518 --> 01:36:01.281]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[01:36:01.861 --> 01:36:04.723]  So, he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[01:36:07.230 --> 01:36:11.195]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[01:36:11.575 --> 01:36:13.678]  We normally sell for $249 and it's a great deal.
[01:36:14.258 --> 01:36:17.402]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[01:36:17.763 --> 01:36:18.103]  It's $127.
[01:36:18.804 --> 01:36:22.588]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[01:36:23.424 --> 01:36:24.605]  And I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:26.746]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[01:36:26.786 --> 01:36:28.988]  I mean, I'm all for great deals, but this is insane.
[01:36:29.508 --> 01:36:32.170]  This will cut out the entire water filter market, what you've done here.
[01:36:32.551 --> 01:36:33.791]  He says, well, it's a one-time deal.
[01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:35.132]  And there's a couple thousand of them.
[01:36:35.573 --> 01:36:40.096]  And he called this morning and said, whoa, you are really moving these.
[01:36:40.176 --> 01:36:41.397]  And I go, yeah, this is the best deal ever.
[01:36:41.477 --> 01:36:43.238]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[01:36:43.678 --> 01:36:47.001]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family, get the best, the best deal.
[01:36:48.778 --> 01:36:58.044]  Replace an old system you've got, or give it as a gift to your children, or your mother, your father, your neighbors, your church, your deer hunting lives.
[01:36:58.765 --> 01:36:59.205]  Whatever!
[01:36:59.465 --> 01:37:00.646]  These are great Christmas gifts.
[01:37:00.946 --> 01:37:03.168]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[01:37:03.268 --> 01:37:03.768]  It's amazing.
[01:37:03.868 --> 01:37:09.852]  AlexaPurePro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:37:09.872 --> 01:37:12.294]  This is the best deal in 23 years I've ever heard of.
[01:37:12.314 --> 01:37:13.555]  The best system, the best price.
[01:37:19.098 --> 01:37:24.261]  And it funds the Infowar, though not much, doing us a favor to help move all these out for them, and I understand.
[01:37:24.561 --> 01:37:28.764]  So we're doing it, even though I'm forgiving you a good deal, but not this good.
[01:37:28.784 --> 01:37:29.844]  This undercuts the whole market.
[01:37:30.104 --> 01:37:31.905]  This is the best deal ever!
[01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:32.886]  It's insane.
[01:37:33.286 --> 01:37:35.567]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:36.128 --> 01:37:37.008]  Please support the broadcast.
[01:37:37.028 --> 01:37:41.270]  A bunch of other big specials in this weekend, so check those out, and thanks for funding the operation.
[01:37:41.991 --> 01:37:42.291]  All right.
[01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:44.251]  Go to Roger Stone.
[01:37:44.291 --> 01:37:47.153]  Roger, you know it's a love-hate thing here with covering the Russia thing.
[01:37:47.173 --> 01:37:49.015]  We have to, but it's all a bunch of BS.
[01:37:49.215 --> 01:37:53.158]  Our whole audience knows we're not involved with the Russians, other than you're getting a bunch of them arrested in the 80s.
[01:37:53.438 --> 01:37:54.519]  We know Hillary's the culprit.
[01:37:54.539 --> 01:37:55.500]  We know Mueller is.
[01:37:55.961 --> 01:38:03.527]  But new developments here, bombshell info that they knew they were... Mueller and his prosecutors, Hillary's personal attack dog.
[01:38:03.567 --> 01:38:04.868]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:38:05.088 --> 01:38:06.570]  And now Trump's gone off the...
[01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:08.631]  Well, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:38:08.671 --> 01:38:12.715]  It's almost as if the President has been reading the coverage of what's been going on with me and, of course, Dr. Jerry Corsi.
[01:38:36.141 --> 01:38:56.410]  Yesterday, I released a substantial number of text exchanges with Randy Credico, which proved beyond any dispute that he was indeed my source, who told me about the explosive nature of the WikiLeaks disclosures that Julian Assange himself had announced in June on CNN in 2016.
[01:38:57.791 --> 01:38:57.991]  Yeah.
[01:39:28.852 --> 01:39:35.876]  In other words, to put it another way Alex, it appears to me that Randy Credico perjured himself before the Mueller Grand Jury.
[01:39:36.316 --> 01:39:39.238]  Will he be held responsible for lying under oath?
[01:39:39.658 --> 01:39:40.319]  Let's hope so.
[01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:43.981]  Well, I don't have any dog in the fight other than justice.
[01:39:44.001 --> 01:39:47.023]  I just don't know why he told all these people this.
[01:39:47.783 --> 01:39:53.647]  I knew you had the text messages a while back and why he would be doing this and why Mueller would bring him in there when Mueller has
[01:39:55.006 --> 01:39:58.027]  Obviously been parallel constructing all this and was surveilling everyone before.
[01:39:58.267 --> 01:39:59.888]  Mueller already knows all this isn't true.
[01:40:00.128 --> 01:40:01.729]  So why in the hell did he do this?
[01:40:02.809 --> 01:40:05.270]  It's kind of like that old Bob Dylan line.
[01:40:05.871 --> 01:40:09.992]  The order I think Mr. Mueller gave his staff is everybody must get stoned.
[01:40:10.432 --> 01:40:10.853]  Exactly.
[01:40:10.893 --> 01:40:21.037]  Look, I'm a target because I supported Donald Trump for president, because I appear regularly on InfoWars, because I help you bring people the truth.
[01:40:21.477 --> 01:40:29.661]  And because I was effective in helping defeat Hillary Clinton by writing the book, The Clinton's War on Women, available at the Infowars.com store.
[01:40:30.241 --> 01:40:37.104]  Because I co-produced the documentary, The Danny Williams Story, banished The Danny Williams Story.
[01:40:37.124 --> 01:40:42.007]  Well sure, and Get Me Roger Stone was a pretty powerful documentary, it was a huge hit on Netflix.
[01:40:42.347 --> 01:40:44.268]  That was like waving a red cape and a bull's face.
[01:40:45.492 --> 01:40:49.735]  Yeah, so now they're saying, get Roger Stone, as opposed to get me Roger Stone.
[01:40:49.795 --> 01:40:51.335]  Look, I know it grows tedious.
[01:40:51.395 --> 01:40:52.576]  It's tedious for me too.
[01:40:52.916 --> 01:40:57.179]  But there is no evidence whatsoever that I knew in advance about the source or content.
[01:40:57.199 --> 01:40:57.999]  I know, we all know that.
[01:40:58.039 --> 01:40:58.380]  We know that.
[01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:01.001]  The reason I've got you on is, what's the word?
[01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:03.583]  Does they say it's going to be over in a few days?
[01:41:04.103 --> 01:41:05.604]  Or maybe it's going to keep going forever?
[01:41:05.624 --> 01:41:08.466]  I mean, how long is this idiocy going to continue?
[01:41:08.726 --> 01:41:12.488]  So we can obviously move on to the fake congressional investigations they're about to have.
[01:41:13.595 --> 01:41:15.156]  It's very hard to know, Alex.
[01:41:15.256 --> 01:41:30.462]  I mean, for me, this has been over two years of my life, having the federal government and Robert Mueller and his band of cutthroats digging into every microscopic detail of my private life, questioning people over and over again.
[01:41:30.782 --> 01:41:33.463]  What about Roger Stone's relationship with Alex Jones?
[01:41:33.823 --> 01:41:36.284]  How often does Roger Stone talk to Alex Jones?
[01:41:36.524 --> 01:41:40.486]  Do you think Roger Stone passed any of the WikiLeaks material on to Alex Jones?
[01:41:40.886 --> 01:41:43.507]  I never even had the material to pass on.
[01:41:43.947 --> 01:41:50.931]  But they're looking at every aspect of my life, my family life, my social life, my personal life, my business life, my political life.
[01:41:50.951 --> 01:41:51.812]  So let's bring this up.
[01:41:51.932 --> 01:41:53.913]  I mean, I think Trump, here's the deal.
[01:41:54.353 --> 01:42:01.277]  When we learned from the grand jury that Hillary's top attack dog that literally helped cover up Uranium One
[01:42:02.117 --> 01:42:06.498]  ...materially is involved with the Russians, and is now the prosecutor.
[01:42:06.558 --> 01:42:09.599]  This is like having Hitler run a Nuremberg trial.
[01:42:09.619 --> 01:42:10.979]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:42:11.339 --> 01:42:13.019]  I've never heard of conflicts of interest.
[01:42:13.139 --> 01:42:15.220]  Material conflicts like this, Roger.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:18.100]  Yeah, it's extraordinarily political.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:22.741]  And as Tyler Nixon made the case, it's an egregious actual conflict of interest.
[01:42:23.101 --> 01:42:30.363]  Having Hillary's henchwoman run the investigation into Roger Stone, the nemesis of Hillary Clinton... When she's involved with the Russians,
[01:42:31.829 --> 01:42:35.294]  I mean, she literally is involved with Hillary running all this with the Russians!
[01:42:35.354 --> 01:42:36.775]  I mean, it's insane!
[01:42:54.804 --> 01:42:59.566]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[01:42:59.606 --> 01:43:16.572]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[01:43:17.073 --> 01:43:17.713]  But is it true?
[01:43:18.633 --> 01:43:25.122]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[01:43:26.124 --> 01:43:29.728]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:31.992]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:36.051]  So the establishment wants us off the air at any cost.
[01:43:36.091 --> 01:43:41.113]  Because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming live every day from 11 a.m.
[01:43:41.313 --> 01:43:41.913]  to 3 p.m.
[01:43:41.973 --> 01:43:42.854]  just on my show.
[01:43:43.154 --> 01:43:45.575]  You got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[01:43:45.615 --> 01:43:45.955]  Central.
[01:43:46.395 --> 01:43:49.916]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:43:49.956 --> 01:43:50.477]  in the War Room.
[01:43:50.677 --> 01:43:52.697]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[01:43:53.158 --> 01:43:53.878]  They're trying to block that.
[01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:58.593]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[01:43:59.274 --> 01:44:06.380]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:09.422]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[01:44:10.203 --> 01:44:14.408]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers, not let us advertise online.
[01:44:14.849 --> 01:44:18.473]  Kick us off PayPal, kick us off Facebook, kick us off Twitter, kick us off YouTube.
[01:44:18.493 --> 01:44:25.101]  And over a hundred other platforms now, where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[01:44:25.681 --> 01:44:32.907]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding by contacting companies who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[01:44:33.768 --> 01:44:35.810]  That's because we are on target.
[01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:38.032]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[01:44:38.052 --> 01:44:39.953]  We're exposing their main operation.
[01:44:40.414 --> 01:44:42.075]  And look, I know you guys know that.
[01:44:42.495 --> 01:44:43.376]  That's why you supported us.
[01:44:43.416 --> 01:44:49.481]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:44:50.723 --> 01:44:52.666]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[01:44:52.686 --> 01:45:02.941]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[01:45:03.302 --> 01:45:04.383]  To hand-share those links.
[01:45:04.423 --> 01:45:05.986]  To text message people.
[01:45:06.346 --> 01:45:09.768]  Information you think is particularly important, to get around the censors.
[01:45:09.828 --> 01:45:11.189]  Nothing can stop your word of mouth.
[01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:15.211]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[01:45:15.451 --> 01:45:17.813]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[01:45:18.333 --> 01:45:27.078]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[01:45:27.098 --> 01:45:32.421]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, they're all there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:32.461 --> 01:45:34.202]  Patriot apparel, it's all there.
[01:45:35.503 --> 01:45:47.972]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:48.052 --> 01:46:00.561]  And we already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:04.544]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[01:46:04.944 --> 01:46:09.348]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[01:46:09.388 --> 01:46:16.235]  So please take advantage of them today at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[01:46:16.635 --> 01:46:18.056]  Everybody loves Brain Force.
[01:46:18.157 --> 01:46:20.218]  We haven't tried it yet, so 3% off.
[01:46:20.439 --> 01:46:22.040]  Everybody really loves mercurial silver.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.882]  Highest quality, 67% off, silver bullet.
[01:46:25.363 --> 01:46:31.706]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off in free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:31.726 --> 01:46:37.789]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars, and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[01:46:42.291 --> 01:46:46.893]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:53.416 --> 01:46:54.477]  Monday through Friday, we're here.
[01:46:55.672 --> 01:46:56.972]  And Sunday's 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:46:58.133 --> 01:47:01.174]  Hard to believe it's already Thursday.
[01:47:02.294 --> 01:47:03.274]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:47:04.575 --> 01:47:13.057]  Live from Shotgun, here with me is Roger Stone from Broward County, Florida, where he's going to be able to get into election fraud and take your phone calls.
[01:47:13.497 --> 01:47:16.558]  And that really is the big issue right now, in my view, at the latest on the caravan.
[01:47:16.578 --> 01:47:18.178]  We have Harrison Smith here as well.
[01:47:18.218 --> 01:47:20.279]  He'll be going to the next hour with us when Fox Day joins us.
[01:47:20.299 --> 01:47:22.840]  And we're going to be looking at the most shocking
[01:47:23.905 --> 01:47:27.568]  There's anti-white brainwashing going on in schools that you've ever seen.
[01:47:28.268 --> 01:47:31.971]  The left is going into pure race-based politics, like they're in the KKK or something.
[01:47:32.311 --> 01:47:34.633]  They hold up pictures of white people and they go, eww!
[01:47:34.973 --> 01:47:35.914]  They go, why don't you like him?
[01:47:35.954 --> 01:47:36.675]  They're white!
[01:47:37.836 --> 01:47:40.838]  I mean, this is America, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:41.278 --> 01:47:43.500]  This is true Marxist liberation theology.
[01:47:44.963 --> 01:47:46.604]  Roger, though, putting bookends on this thing.
[01:47:46.644 --> 01:47:50.585]  I was asking during the break, you can repeat it, what is it like them saying you're going to be indicted Friday?
[01:47:50.605 --> 01:47:52.486]  You know, they've said that so many times last year.
[01:47:52.526 --> 01:47:59.849]  Meanwhile, Trump tears into Mueller investigation, calls Russia probe absolutely nuts, talks about all the criminal things they've done.
[01:47:59.869 --> 01:48:10.753]  And then there's this, Hillary's henchwoman heads Mueller's probe of Stone, and then she's involved with the lawsuits for racketeering, with her foundation, with Uranium One.
[01:48:10.773 --> 01:48:13.734]  I mean, this lady is involved in all of this.
[01:48:14.654 --> 01:48:18.116]  And then now, so is Mueller.
[01:48:18.156 --> 01:48:25.580]  It's clear they chose the Russia thing to cover for themselves because it would be so insane that the actual people that did it are the ones accusing you of it.
[01:48:26.461 --> 01:48:28.342]  This is like beyond any movie you've ever heard of.
[01:48:28.382 --> 01:48:30.123]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:48:30.143 --> 01:48:31.404]  So in closing on that, Roger.
[01:48:32.955 --> 01:48:36.440]  Well, Alex, it's part of the psychological game they try to play.
[01:48:36.621 --> 01:48:44.553]  Virtually every Friday, they will have a reporter call me or my lawyer, usually from CNN, saying, do you think it's this weekend that you'll be arrested?
[01:48:45.409 --> 01:48:49.111]  It's designed to unsettle you and upset your weekend.
[01:48:49.331 --> 01:48:56.434]  I, of course, never take it terribly seriously because I know I've committed no crime in connection with the 2016 election.
[01:48:56.874 --> 01:48:59.555]  Could they frame me for some process crime?
[01:48:59.595 --> 01:49:00.376]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:49:00.716 --> 01:49:03.517]  But if they do, I will plead not guilty and I will fight.
[01:49:04.017 --> 01:49:07.600]  Because I'm being targeted because I'm on Infowars.
[01:49:08.001 --> 01:49:10.603]  I'm being targeted because I supported Donald Trump.
[01:49:11.003 --> 01:49:14.787]  I'm being targeted because I opposed Hillary Clinton and I was quite effective at it.
[01:49:15.167 --> 01:49:21.473]  So this is payback for 40 years of beating liberal Democrats at the polls and nothing more.
[01:49:22.093 --> 01:49:24.676]  And that's the next issue, Harrison Smith.
[01:49:24.836 --> 01:49:26.377]  We're not just saying they're stealing.
[01:49:26.437 --> 01:49:27.758]  It's famous counties that steal.
[01:49:28.757 --> 01:49:31.459]  The illegal ballots they admit just keep coming in.
[01:49:31.519 --> 01:49:34.402]  They get caught, admit a bunch of them are totally provisional and fake.
[01:49:34.922 --> 01:49:40.587]  You have women like running with bags and hiding, acting totally suspiciously and then putting walls up so you can't see it.
[01:49:41.788 --> 01:49:46.071]  You've got all the races going for Democrats magically where Republicans barely win.
[01:49:46.972 --> 01:49:53.540]  And then suddenly famous counties for corruption hold things open for weeks, break all the laws, and then magically the Democrats are winning.
[01:49:53.801 --> 01:49:56.764]  Very powerful Michael Snyder article at Infowars.com.
[01:49:57.065 --> 01:50:03.492]  Post-election blue wave, Democrats have flipped two Senate seats and a large number of House seats since election night.
[01:50:04.511 --> 01:50:05.591]  We need to get this fixed.
[01:50:05.631 --> 01:50:06.952]  This is the real emergency here.
[01:50:07.372 --> 01:50:09.053]  Well, I mean, just look at Brenda Snipes.
[01:50:09.133 --> 01:50:14.915]  Why was she ever allowed to continue after 2016 when she was caught illegally destroying ballots?
[01:50:15.015 --> 01:50:19.317]  Why is she still in charge of anything, let alone, you know, walking free?
[01:50:19.337 --> 01:50:21.077]  She's messing with the elections.
[01:50:21.417 --> 01:50:27.840]  She was famous in 2000 for this crap, and now she says she's going to ride off in the sunset after this one.
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:32.584]  Well look, they're trying to undermine the one outlet that is legitimate.
[01:50:32.644 --> 01:50:36.647]  They want to degrade our belief in the voting system.
[01:50:36.687 --> 01:50:46.154]  They want people to believe that they have no choice but to rebel and cause violence and chaos and riot and all of this stuff because the one outlet we still have is our ability to vote.
[01:50:46.234 --> 01:50:51.659]  If they steal that from us, if they degrade our confidence in that, then we have no other option.
[01:50:54.861 --> 01:50:58.323]  Absolutely, and now we've got Chuckie Schumer and Obama saying everyone should be able to vote.
[01:50:58.343 --> 01:51:00.143]  If you're in the country, you should be able to vote.
[01:51:00.383 --> 01:51:05.706]  Roger, I want to go to some calls on this subject and others about what Trump needs to do here in just a moment.
[01:51:05.746 --> 01:51:10.288]  But just, you're in Broward County, supposedly today's the last day of the recount or whatever.
[01:51:11.208 --> 01:51:17.851]  Chuckie Schumer's saying, oh don't worry, you know, we're gonna get that governorship, we're gonna get the Senate, we're gonna get everything.
[01:51:18.151 --> 01:51:20.112]  Just the arrogance of these monsters.
[01:51:21.817 --> 01:51:23.938]  You know, Alex, you've been on radio a long time.
[01:51:23.998 --> 01:51:28.260]  Have you ever heard anybody who sounds less sincere than Chuck Schumer?
[01:51:28.741 --> 01:51:32.623]  Who sounds swarmier and phonier than Chuck Schumer?
[01:51:33.223 --> 01:51:34.624]  It's really something to behold.
[01:51:35.534 --> 01:51:46.600]  Look, I actually think that the Republicans will hold on to the governorship here in Florida because I think former Congressman Ron DeSantis' margin is too great to overcome, even with the shenanigans in Broward County.
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:57.966]  That means within 10 seconds of his taking his hand off the Bible, he will fire Brenda Snipes, which the previous governor, the current governor, should have done four months ago when I called for it.
[01:51:58.406 --> 01:52:04.809]  Based on her involvement with voter fraud two years ago and in the most recent Republican congressional primaries.
[01:52:05.269 --> 01:52:07.610]  So you weep what you sow.
[01:52:07.710 --> 01:52:14.433]  Had this woman been removed when we called for it here on InfoWars, you wouldn't have this quagmire going on in Florida.
[01:52:14.893 --> 01:52:31.123]  Meanwhile, Republican observers are not allowed to observe the recount in Broward County, a violation of Florida state sunshine law, and they are continuing to count votes that have been disallowed, that have already been declared illegal by the election board.
[01:52:31.443 --> 01:52:35.326]  So you have widespread election fraud going on in this one county.
[01:52:36.407 --> 01:52:40.450]  Whether or not Rick Scott can hold on to ascendancy is an open question.
[01:52:40.871 --> 01:52:53.803]  I do think we'll hold on to the governorship and I'm very concerned about the race for Commissioner of Agriculture only because the candidates in that race are both thoroughbreds with a great future.
[01:52:54.503 --> 01:52:56.966]  The Republicans shouldn't concede in Arizona.
[01:52:56.986 --> 01:52:58.167]  They shouldn't concede on any of these.
[01:52:58.507 --> 01:53:00.988]  We have real fraud here and they should stop conceding.
[01:53:01.028 --> 01:53:04.269]  Let's go to Matt in Texas on Florida election fraud.
[01:53:04.329 --> 01:53:09.170]  Matt, you're on the air with myself, Roger Stone, and of course, Harrison Smith.
[01:53:09.190 --> 01:53:09.530]  Go ahead.
[01:53:10.671 --> 01:53:12.992]  Hey Alex, hey all three of y'all, Roger and Harrison.
[01:53:13.032 --> 01:53:16.473]  Hey Harrison, I was with Harrison and Owen the other night.
[01:53:16.833 --> 01:53:18.313]  We were just talking about this.
[01:53:19.394 --> 01:53:26.836]  I was asking them if everybody else was holding their breath on the Florida results as I was.
[01:53:28.005 --> 01:53:30.466]  And, uh, and and the numbers were off.
[01:53:30.486 --> 01:53:32.187]  And of course, it's Broward County.
[01:53:32.267 --> 01:53:34.508]  It always comes down to what it's like.
[01:53:34.728 --> 01:53:39.650]  Oh, Roger was saying that night when we, you know, when we were living like one, he goes, I'm really surprised they conceded.
[01:53:39.670 --> 01:53:41.451]  They always steal it when they're close.
[01:53:41.691 --> 01:53:47.173]  And then they were just waiting, knowing we were watching until they did a fake concession and then went in and started stuffing.
[01:53:48.194 --> 01:53:48.914]  Absolutely.
[01:53:49.274 --> 01:53:56.197]  And it's like I can only it's it's like the movie Indiana Jones where they open the tomb and they know where the Ark is.
[01:53:56.995 --> 01:53:59.517]  And he throws the torch down onto the floor.
[01:53:59.537 --> 01:54:00.517]  There's a bunch of snakes.
[01:54:00.698 --> 01:54:02.919]  And the guy says, why is the floor moving indeed?
[01:54:03.219 --> 01:54:03.860]  And it's snakes.
[01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:05.461]  Why did it have to be snakes?
[01:54:06.001 --> 01:54:07.302]  That's exactly what's going on.
[01:54:07.882 --> 01:54:10.484]  So we're coming up on the witching hour here.
[01:54:11.805 --> 01:54:16.508]  I think we're probably within an hour of it, I guess, as it nears.
[01:54:16.968 --> 01:54:18.129]  So we'll figure it out.
[01:54:21.661 --> 01:54:23.322]  It'll be interesting to see what they pull off.
[01:54:23.422 --> 01:54:26.124]  I mean, I guarantee you they're not signing Republican ballots.
[01:54:26.344 --> 01:54:29.606]  Oh no, she's been caught putting provisionals.
[01:54:30.046 --> 01:54:33.389]  Well, they were all for Democrats and they weren't real votes, but it's okay.
[01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:34.189]  It's okay.
[01:54:34.389 --> 01:54:35.050]  She's on video.
[01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:36.050]  Oh, no big deal.
[01:54:36.911 --> 01:54:37.291]  Exactly.
[01:54:37.331 --> 01:54:39.112]  And what's with the medical globe?
[01:54:39.132 --> 01:54:41.654]  We're turning this fraud into a medical scheme now?
[01:54:42.691 --> 01:54:46.373]  Well they just do that to act like it's like something scientific they're doing.
[01:54:47.093 --> 01:54:48.534]  I appreciate you calling in, good points.
[01:54:49.354 --> 01:54:57.838]  Roger, again, Hillary, and I said this a week ago, Matt Gaetz said it two days ago, this is a test run for 2020.
[01:54:58.218 --> 01:55:06.902]  Now Hillary's saying, oh I may run because she sees the Republicans bending over with a big giant green light to let American voting rights be gang raped.
[01:55:08.562 --> 01:55:10.705]  In all honesty, let's take Arizona for example.
[01:55:10.785 --> 01:55:19.495]  If I were the Republican majority, I would not allow the seating of this elected senator, and I would challenge those results in the state courts in Arizona.
[01:55:20.256 --> 01:55:21.197]  We have the majority.
[01:55:21.237 --> 01:55:22.558]  We can decide who is seated.
[01:55:22.979 --> 01:55:28.926]  I believe that election is fraudulent, and until the courts rule otherwise, I wouldn't seat the senator from Arizona.
[01:55:29.826 --> 01:55:31.608]  They want to play hardball, let's play hardball.
[01:55:31.788 --> 01:55:32.568]  It's about time.
[01:55:32.668 --> 01:55:34.370]  But look, this is very clear.
[01:55:34.650 --> 01:55:36.491]  The Democrats say count every vote.
[01:55:36.551 --> 01:55:39.093]  The Republicans say count every legal vote.
[01:55:39.373 --> 01:55:40.534]  You see the difference.
[01:55:40.554 --> 01:55:47.439]  And let's be clear, you went in there, and again, I don't like George W. Bush, Al Gore I hate even more, but you were there.
[01:55:47.519 --> 01:55:50.601]  You helped take it away from them when they were trying to steal it before in Broward County.
[01:55:50.842 --> 01:55:52.583]  You went in there and kicked their ass.
[01:55:53.023 --> 01:55:55.265]  And that's what we need is some frickin' huevos here, man.
[01:55:56.010 --> 01:55:57.191]  Well, that's exactly true.
[01:55:57.251 --> 01:56:03.834]  We prevented the Democrats in Miami-Dade County from counting the same sheaf of ballots for the third time.
[01:56:04.254 --> 01:56:05.895]  We didn't shut down the recount.
[01:56:05.955 --> 01:56:06.655]  That's false.
[01:56:07.015 --> 01:56:18.921]  We stopped them from recounting the same ballots the third time by taking them to an area that was private where there was no observers from the media or the Republican Party where they could tamper with them in violation of the state's
[01:56:19.341 --> 01:56:20.102]  Sunshine Law.
[01:56:20.163 --> 01:56:29.857]  So the Brooks Brothers Riot was an act of civic action to support the state's Sunshine Law and stop them from stealing.
[01:56:30.198 --> 01:56:33.443]  That's the truth that the mainstream media doesn't like to tell you.
[01:56:34.639 --> 01:56:38.942]  We're going to jam a few more calls, and when we come back here, then after Roger leaves us, I'm going to continue with calls.
[01:56:38.982 --> 01:56:39.983]  Vox Day is going to be here.
[01:56:40.564 --> 01:56:45.387]  We have, at the start of the next hour, the most insane race-based brainwashing going on.
[01:56:45.407 --> 01:56:50.271]  We're going to show you the shocking video coming up in the next hour as well.
[01:56:50.291 --> 01:56:52.012]  We'll look at the EU Brexit.
[01:56:52.312 --> 01:56:54.854]  They're stealing the vote of three years ago.
[01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:57.036]  Paul Watson is in Parliament right now.
[01:56:57.056 --> 01:56:57.797]  He's part of UKIP.
[01:56:58.297 --> 01:57:01.598]  He'll be calling in or we'll have him on tomorrow with the latest, but this is amazing.
[01:57:01.978 --> 01:57:03.859]  It's all about ignoring the popular vote.
[01:57:03.879 --> 01:57:06.740]  It's all about ignoring the people wanting to be sovereign.
[01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:11.802]  But they can steal it a few times, but that'll only wake folks up and make them that much more angry.
[01:57:12.082 --> 01:57:13.543]  So don't give up if they're stealing.
[01:57:13.903 --> 01:57:16.844]  They're having to steal in front of everybody because they're so desperate.
[01:57:17.224 --> 01:57:19.085]  Please don't forget also we're listener supported.
[01:57:19.125 --> 01:57:22.226]  You get great products and support the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:57:22.406 --> 01:57:24.927]  One of our biggest sales ever ends this Sunday.
[01:57:25.388 --> 01:57:26.048]  Check it out today.
[01:57:30.359 --> 01:57:38.008]  It was probably 10 years ago or more that Barbra Streisand had this huge mansion on the edge of the ocean.
[01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:40.431]  And somebody had just reported about it.
[01:57:41.332 --> 01:57:43.595]  And so she tried to have them basically shut down.
[01:57:43.615 --> 01:57:46.999]  And that drew a million times more attention to it all.
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:57.123]  Well, the social engineers, because I read about it in the news, they actually openly talk about how to censor conservatives and nationalists, and how to make sure people don't care about it.
[01:57:57.423 --> 01:58:01.865]  And they say, well, as long as we censor a lot of them at one time, it won't matter.
[01:58:02.145 --> 01:58:05.306]  And they'll give it more attention at first, but then later everybody will forget about it.
[01:58:05.326 --> 01:58:06.906]  Because the public's dumb and doesn't have a memory.
[01:58:07.266 --> 01:58:10.147]  They're betting on you not valuing information.
[01:58:10.387 --> 01:58:12.468]  And there are thousands of channels out there, tens of thousands.
[01:58:13.302 --> 01:58:19.330]  But InfoWars is what they've targeted particularly because we've got their number and we know about their criminal plans.
[01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:25.237]  So of all the ways you can spread the word about InfoWars, the newest and one of the coolest is hiding in plain view.
[01:58:25.718 --> 01:58:26.379]  Why not think of this?
[01:58:26.899 --> 01:58:29.503]  Text the word NEWS to the number 33222.
[01:58:31.665 --> 01:58:41.333]  And we will send you one alert a day of the most important breaking news for you to hopefully spread, everybody you know, to cause that chain reaction of communication they fear so much.
[01:58:41.353 --> 01:58:52.662]  And if you want to get live breaking news feeds, when it's not just my main show every day, but emergency live reports we do almost every day, when we do those, we will send you a text that we're going live.
[01:58:52.803 --> 01:58:53.803]  Hopefully you'll spread it.
[01:58:54.024 --> 01:58:54.824]  That's what's really key.
[01:58:55.305 --> 01:58:57.506]  Text the word SHOW to the number 33222.
[01:58:59.568 --> 01:59:02.369]  Ladies and gentlemen, nothing can stop you when you take action.
[01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:04.929]  Nothing can stop you when you resist the globalists.
[01:59:05.469 --> 01:59:09.230]  They are counting on you being weak and having no memory and not taking action.
[01:59:09.670 --> 01:59:15.792]  When you make it fun to fight these bastards and realize it's an info war, you're unstoppable and we will defeat these people.
[01:59:16.192 --> 01:59:18.132]  Everything is now in your hands.
[01:59:18.672 --> 01:59:21.013]  Text to those numbers and spread those links.
[01:59:32.378 --> 01:59:47.353]  Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:53.539]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:00.723 --> 02:00:02.104]  Let's go to Greg in Oregon.
[02:00:02.724 --> 02:00:06.766]  Greg, let's talk about Antifa, social media, executive orders, and the election.
[02:00:06.786 --> 02:00:07.486]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:00:08.326 --> 02:00:14.669]  Okay, number one, the reason why there are so many Antifa-style people or Antifa-leaning people
[02:00:16.283 --> 02:00:27.174]  Well, if you have a box of roosters and worms, and you take the roosters out of that box by force, the worms are going to look around and see only other worms and think they're winning.
[02:00:27.734 --> 02:00:29.836]  This is what happened on Twitter and Facebook.
[02:00:30.096 --> 02:00:37.644]  When they banned conservatives, everyone going into Twitter saw nothing but liberals and thought, oh, well, the whole world must be liberal.
[02:00:38.365 --> 02:00:45.590]  So that swings people's decisions in certain ways, because if they never hear from our side, they're never going to have all the information.
[02:00:45.610 --> 02:00:58.178]  And that's why they're trying to ban and eradicate Proud Boys, because Proud Boys goes out and defends women and children being attacked, kicks the ass of the little professors that want to beat up women and children, and so now they still won't show up, and still Proud Boys is still showing up.
[02:01:00.059 --> 02:01:00.480]  Amen.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.221]  Okay, my second point.
[02:01:02.902 --> 02:01:13.593]  Is that V-O-A-T dot C-O forward slash V forward slash Q-R-V forward slash 2-8-5-0-2-5-3.
[02:01:13.713 --> 02:01:23.102]  A very well written article regarding an executive order written on December 21st, 2018, which allows 45 days after the election
[02:01:27.242 --> 02:01:33.704]  The Department of Homeland Security is going to have a report on election fraud showing foreign interference.
[02:01:34.184 --> 02:01:38.845]  Now, the definition of foreign interference is largely illegal aliens voting.
[02:01:39.265 --> 02:01:44.947]  This will come before the new Congress convenes, and it's a sting operation.
[02:01:45.307 --> 02:01:46.567]  Well, let me say this.
[02:01:46.587 --> 02:01:48.448]  Yes, Trump needs to take action, and I want to ask Roger.
[02:01:49.068 --> 02:01:53.211]  The best way to give out stuff is not its URL, if it's a long URL.
[02:01:53.671 --> 02:01:55.913]  The best way to give it out is the name of the article.
[02:01:56.353 --> 02:01:57.714]  So we can pull up what you're talking about.
[02:01:57.954 --> 02:01:58.915]  What's the name of the article?
[02:01:59.855 --> 02:02:02.217]  What will happen to address voter fraud?
[02:02:02.497 --> 02:02:03.478]  We have it all.
[02:02:03.938 --> 02:02:06.000]  It's on vote.
[02:02:06.961 --> 02:02:08.883]  What will happen to address voter fraud?
[02:02:08.923 --> 02:02:09.463]  We have it all.
[02:02:09.503 --> 02:02:09.723]  Thank you.
[02:02:09.743 --> 02:02:10.284]  We'll look that up.
[02:02:11.164 --> 02:02:11.605]  Thank you, sir.
[02:02:12.666 --> 02:02:13.787]  Roger Harrison, you want to comment?
[02:02:13.807 --> 02:02:15.108]  I mean, Trump's got to get serious.
[02:02:15.128 --> 02:02:16.309]  He's got to start addressing the nation.
[02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:18.631]  He's got to admit Democrats aren't Americans.
[02:02:18.691 --> 02:02:19.972]  They say you can't be a nationalist.
[02:02:20.352 --> 02:02:21.553]  They fundamentally hate the country.
[02:02:21.573 --> 02:02:26.597]  We have to admit this is a outside invasion force, not just the illegals, but the Democrats themselves.
[02:02:26.617 --> 02:02:28.419]  We have to go after this illegitimate election.
[02:02:29.279 --> 02:02:33.383]  He has to start indicting the Democratic leadership.
[02:02:33.444 --> 02:02:34.084]  These are criminals.
[02:02:34.104 --> 02:02:35.846]  I mean, that's what his duty is.
[02:02:36.146 --> 02:02:38.188]  We're at war with an outside force.
[02:02:38.228 --> 02:02:38.669]  What do we do?
[02:02:40.090 --> 02:02:46.817]  Well, the single most important thing he can do is to ensure free and full access to an unfettered Internet.
[02:02:47.446 --> 02:02:54.134]  I mean, in all honesty, if we don't have the ability to communicate, then we cannot possibly win in any realm.
[02:02:54.674 --> 02:03:05.887]  That's why our project, WriteTrump.com, which, by the way, is really moving along, in which we are trying to collect, right here at InfoWars, one million individual letters to the President,
[02:03:06.327 --> 02:03:33.707]  Demanding that he order the Justice Department to take antitrust action to stop the monopolistic racketeering practices of the big tech giants who are seeking to shut down not just InfoWars, but all conservative sites, all Trump supporters, whacking, decapitating conservatives and Republicans at Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, not to mention what's being done to InfoWars.
[02:03:34.067 --> 02:03:35.708]  You can take direct action.
[02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:36.889]  Take action right now.
[02:03:37.429 --> 02:03:41.733]  Alex Jones personally has agreed to pay for the postage for your letter.
[02:03:42.133 --> 02:03:45.135]  Go online, write, sign your letter to the president.
[02:03:45.376 --> 02:03:49.279]  You can even write in your personal PS and we will print it out.
[02:03:49.339 --> 02:03:56.004]  You can print it out and mail it in, but we will also print it out, put it in an envelope and mail it to the president.
[02:03:56.324 --> 02:03:57.025]  Take action.
[02:03:57.245 --> 02:03:58.506]  You can do it right now.
[02:03:59.707 --> 02:04:00.128]  That's right.
[02:04:00.208 --> 02:04:08.625]  Roger, I will be talking to you obviously during the war room today at 3 o'clock and as this all unfolds with Mueller and all the craziness, but what a time to be alive.
[02:04:08.645 --> 02:04:09.186]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:10.790]  Good to be here.
[02:04:11.190 --> 02:04:14.091]  And all these callers are on subjects that Vox Day can get into.
[02:04:14.131 --> 02:04:17.691]  We're gonna get into the EU, the Brexit theft, huge developments.
[02:04:17.791 --> 02:04:20.112]  We'll get to everybody that's holding now, I'll get to you.
[02:04:20.512 --> 02:04:24.292]  Cameron and Michael and Chase and Kim and Jerome and Marco and everybody.
[02:04:24.633 --> 02:04:34.574]  When we come back though, the most shocking racist brainwashing of children by leftist, basically a communist Girl Scout group funded by the left.
[02:04:35.014 --> 02:04:38.315]  Wait till you see what they're teaching young minority children.
[02:04:39.676 --> 02:04:44.037]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[02:05:46.531 --> 02:05:55.217]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:05:58.659 --> 02:06:12.648]  Well, Vox Day, the best-selling author of SJW's Always Lie and SJW's Always Double Down, and he's a very popular, successful rebel comic book company owner, and that's where the real fight for the minds of our young people is going on.
[02:06:12.968 --> 02:06:14.689]  He's going to be riding shotgun with us here in just a few minutes.
[02:06:15.129 --> 02:06:25.780]  You'll be with us for the rest of the segment, Harrison Smith, and we've got your calls coming up, too, on the election stealing, on Brexit being stolen, on what should Trump do next.
[02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:30.144]  We're all going to have this discussion, fast-moving, here in the third hour today.
[02:06:30.985 --> 02:06:35.450]  Then in the fourth hour, Doug Hagman, always informative of the Hagman Report, will be host of the fourth hour.
[02:06:36.192 --> 02:06:39.713]  But right now, Harrison Smith, you did a report on this yesterday during the War Room.
[02:06:39.753 --> 02:06:41.133]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:06:41.753 --> 02:06:43.394]  Tell people what they're about to see.
[02:06:43.734 --> 02:06:46.495]  Well, you're about to see a video called the Radical Cram School.
[02:06:46.535 --> 02:06:51.556]  It's a video series that's documenting sort of the reaction of this, like, communist Girl Scout group.
[02:06:51.596 --> 02:06:53.776]  It's by a comedian, but this is not a satire.
[02:06:54.056 --> 02:06:56.277]  This is them indoctrinating kids in real time.
[02:06:56.297 --> 02:06:57.457]  You see their real reactions.
[02:06:57.837 --> 02:07:03.779]  And as outrageous as it is, as this is, it's not far off from what's being taught in our schools.
[02:07:04.219 --> 02:07:04.679]  Everywhere.
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:07.461]  So this is re-education camp stuff.
[02:07:07.962 --> 02:07:11.944]  Like Hillary said, we need camps for conservatives and adults to make them learn.
[02:07:12.485 --> 02:07:14.786]  They get you in these groups and they introduce these horrible ideas.
[02:07:15.226 --> 02:07:16.407]  This is what CNN is saying.
[02:07:16.507 --> 02:07:17.868]  White people are inherently bad.
[02:07:18.429 --> 02:07:19.529]  The West is inherently bad.
[02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:21.210]  Having a nation is evil.
[02:07:22.711 --> 02:07:25.213]  Every other country for other people, but nothing for Americans.
[02:07:26.194 --> 02:07:31.137]  So this is them completely rolling out the culture war that the Democrats talked about in WikiLeaks.
[02:07:31.297 --> 02:07:38.240]  Oh yeah, no, this is Nazi-level indoctrination, and this is, without hyperbole, the most racist video I've ever seen in my entire life.
[02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:47.785]  What they do is they do things like hold up Harvey Weinstein so he's been demonized for other people, go, well, they'll agree he's bad, he's a serial sex abuser, but for the kids, they don't like him because he's a white man.
[02:07:48.645 --> 02:07:53.228]  But it's okay because they're Asian kids and black kids, so it's so avant-garde and so cool.
[02:07:54.028 --> 02:07:56.229]  And again, even most minorities aren't racist like this.
[02:07:56.269 --> 02:07:59.551]  This is the globalist literally trying to create total division.
[02:07:59.831 --> 02:08:02.572]  Here's part of the sickening YouTube series.
[02:08:03.453 --> 02:08:05.694]  Welcome to Radical Cram School.
[02:08:05.774 --> 02:08:11.696]  We're going to learn about social justice, revolution, and how to be powerful in the bodies that you have.
[02:08:14.218 --> 02:08:16.779]  Hello, my young comrades.
[02:08:18.804 --> 02:08:20.365]  I'm going to show a picture.
[02:08:20.525 --> 02:08:23.386]  This is my way of figuring out if you've been tainted by the patriarchy.
[02:08:23.526 --> 02:08:24.507]  Patriarchy?
[02:08:24.747 --> 02:08:25.127]  What?
[02:08:25.287 --> 02:08:26.508]  Oh!
[02:08:26.588 --> 02:08:27.408]  Who's that?
[02:08:27.648 --> 02:08:28.269]  Who do you think it is?
[02:08:28.309 --> 02:08:29.509]  This looks creepy.
[02:08:29.649 --> 02:08:30.730]  It looks creepy?
[02:08:30.990 --> 02:08:31.390]  Why?
[02:08:31.410 --> 02:08:35.692]  There's just like this thing about white people that just makes me feel... Stop right there.
[02:08:35.732 --> 02:08:36.252]  This is real.
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:42.262]  We're going to get Vox Tase taken on in a moment.
[02:08:42.922 --> 02:08:47.366]  What is the new board member, who's also an Asian woman, there at the New York Times?
[02:08:47.426 --> 02:08:55.594]  She said whites are inherently evil, goblin creatures that live in holes, she can't wait until we're all extinct, and this is kind of the new ruling class.
[02:08:55.614 --> 02:09:00.839]  It's going to be like Asian women that are leftist, but then Harvard says they've got too many Asians and Asians are bad.
[02:09:00.859 --> 02:09:03.221]  So again, they want to divide every group against each other.
[02:09:03.241 --> 02:09:04.882]  This is truly sickening.
[02:09:04.922 --> 02:09:05.323]  Continue.
[02:09:06.085 --> 02:09:13.812]  Like they're like right there in a pool and I'm just like walking into the pool and they just give me the death stare and then I'm just like... So this guy was in the pool.
[02:09:13.832 --> 02:09:14.713]  So that's an important thing.
[02:09:14.733 --> 02:09:15.574]  Back it up ten seconds.
[02:09:15.674 --> 02:09:18.676]  Yeah, they're teaching children to act weird and creepy when you see a white person.
[02:09:18.756 --> 02:09:18.896]  Yeah.
[02:09:19.057 --> 02:09:26.243]  Then that person's gonna think you're looking at me weird, which creates that confirmation thing where these kids really think white people are inherently bad.
[02:09:26.403 --> 02:09:29.386]  Right, I mean this is like a cute little 7-year-old Asian girl.
[02:09:29.566 --> 02:09:30.487]  Back it up 15 seconds.
[02:09:30.567 --> 02:09:33.009]  She's never gotten a death stare because she's Asian.
[02:09:33.049 --> 02:09:33.810]  She lives in America.
[02:09:33.850 --> 02:09:34.591]  She's never gotten that.
[02:09:34.611 --> 02:09:39.516]  What she has gotten is constant indoctrination telling her white people hate you, white people think you're gross.
[02:09:39.536 --> 02:09:44.040]  So then when she sees maybe a facial expression, maybe someone looks at her, you know, anything like that.
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:46.322]  They're putting massive chips on her shoulder.
[02:09:46.422 --> 02:09:47.583]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[02:09:48.524 --> 02:09:49.085]  And it's right there.
[02:09:49.125 --> 02:09:49.625]  You can see that.
[02:09:49.645 --> 02:09:50.366]  It's her natural reaction.
[02:09:50.386 --> 02:09:52.788]  But if you go to Asia, all the different Asian groups hate each other.
[02:09:53.269 --> 02:09:55.110]  China's killed 115 million of its own people.
[02:09:55.131 --> 02:09:55.831]  But no discussion of that.
[02:09:55.851 --> 02:09:56.312]  It's all out.
[02:09:56.552 --> 02:09:59.174]  The big open Christian society is bad.
[02:09:59.715 --> 02:10:01.957]  But we've got to go to our guest here and get his take.
[02:10:01.977 --> 02:10:04.259]  But let's try to not respond too much.
[02:10:04.299 --> 02:10:04.820]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:10:12.201 --> 02:10:16.342]  So if this guy was in the pool, you would moonwalk out.
[02:10:16.562 --> 02:10:18.543]  Does he look like a good guy or a bad guy?
[02:10:18.663 --> 02:10:20.023]  Bad guy!
[02:10:20.203 --> 02:10:21.324]  Who do we think this is?
[02:10:21.584 --> 02:10:22.144]  Make a guess.
[02:10:22.384 --> 02:10:23.764]  Oh, Dumbledore!
[02:10:23.784 --> 02:10:24.725]  Dumbledore!
[02:10:25.125 --> 02:10:25.905]  Who is he married to?
[02:10:25.985 --> 02:10:27.685]  Who's your guess?
[02:10:28.526 --> 02:10:29.026]  Katy Perry.
[02:10:36.949 --> 02:10:38.131]  Uh, he's Donald Duck.
[02:10:38.291 --> 02:10:39.654]  What do we know about him?
[02:10:40.094 --> 02:10:40.936]  What do we know about him?
[02:10:40.956 --> 02:10:41.236]  He's bad!
[02:10:41.256 --> 02:10:42.178]  He's bad!
[02:10:42.298 --> 02:10:43.881]  I'm 14 and a president.
[02:10:43.941 --> 02:10:44.241]  I love Donald!
[02:10:44.935 --> 02:10:47.176]  Imagine this is a group of white kids being shown black people.
[02:10:47.256 --> 02:10:48.557]  How do we feel about this wall?
[02:10:48.577 --> 02:10:55.021]  It is blocking opportunity for people that don't live in America to come here for a better opportunity.
[02:10:55.041 --> 02:10:56.762]  See, that part's pretty poignant too.
[02:10:56.802 --> 02:10:57.683]  They've been loaded with these.
[02:10:57.803 --> 02:10:58.403]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:58.603 --> 02:11:01.966]  My dad came here and my mom came here too.
[02:11:01.986 --> 02:11:02.446]  Pause again.
[02:11:02.766 --> 02:11:03.847]  My dad and my mom are good.
[02:11:03.867 --> 02:11:13.473]  Yeah, and this country let you in and now you're an American which hates America and has been taught that we're trying to block opportunities from you, which are being taught everything belongs to them for the communist takeover.
[02:11:13.513 --> 02:11:13.853]  Continue.
[02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:17.532]  My dad came here and my mom came here, too.
[02:11:18.053 --> 02:11:18.773]  They came here from where?
[02:11:18.793 --> 02:11:19.994]  Cambodia.
[02:11:20.234 --> 02:11:20.595]  Oh, wow.
[02:11:20.615 --> 02:11:20.975]  Cambodia.
[02:11:21.015 --> 02:11:21.756]  Wait, pause.
[02:11:21.836 --> 02:11:24.318]  Where the communists killed almost everybody.
[02:11:24.438 --> 02:11:25.639]  Khmer Rouge killing fields, yep.
[02:11:25.679 --> 02:11:28.021]  But now you've been turned into heading the country that saved you.
[02:11:28.121 --> 02:11:29.602]  Okay, let's continue.
[02:11:29.662 --> 02:11:32.905]  They came from all the way to Cambodia and this is what they get to look at on the TV screen all the time.
[02:11:35.696 --> 02:11:36.937]  It is Hello Kitty.
[02:11:36.957 --> 02:11:37.718]  What is she missing?
[02:11:37.738 --> 02:11:39.198]  Where's her mouth?
[02:11:39.719 --> 02:11:40.499]  Her mouth?
[02:11:40.739 --> 02:11:41.760]  Why doesn't she have a mouth?
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:48.945]  The people who created her didn't want Asian girls to speak up about who they are.
[02:11:49.485 --> 02:11:50.506]  Very profound.
[02:11:50.606 --> 02:11:51.606]  Very profound.
[02:11:51.626 --> 02:11:55.309]  They're rewarded for repeating the mantras and the platitudes.
[02:11:56.776 --> 02:11:58.538]  And this goes on in the colleges, the high schools.
[02:11:58.939 --> 02:12:01.101]  They're teaching your kids that you're not a boy, you're not a girl.
[02:12:01.141 --> 02:12:02.062]  This is total abuse.
[02:12:02.082 --> 02:12:04.525]  This is a criminal, psychological warfare takeover.
[02:12:04.725 --> 02:12:05.746]  It's absolutely child abuse.
[02:12:05.826 --> 02:12:06.387]  It's absolutely.
[02:12:06.627 --> 02:12:16.238]  And you'll notice that, you know... Meanwhile, it was communism, you know, killed her grandparents in Cambodia, but it's okay.
[02:12:17.858 --> 02:12:18.018]  Yeah.
[02:12:18.138 --> 02:12:19.179]  What were you going to say?
[02:12:19.219 --> 02:12:22.980]  Well, you heard that other girl when they said, what do you think about the wall?
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.283]  And she said, it stops people from enjoying the opportunities of America.
[02:12:27.343 --> 02:12:28.663]  It's like, I don't think it was rehearsed.
[02:12:28.723 --> 02:12:30.024]  I think this is just the mantra.
[02:12:30.064 --> 02:12:33.706]  This is the, you know, indoctrination, the platitudes that they're taught.
[02:12:33.746 --> 02:12:34.206]  Sure don't.
[02:12:34.566 --> 02:12:35.687]  They were indoctrinated at home.
[02:12:35.887 --> 02:12:36.087]  Right.
[02:12:36.187 --> 02:12:36.387]  Exactly.
[02:12:36.407 --> 02:12:38.488]  And mama's watching MSNBC all pissed.
[02:12:38.548 --> 02:12:39.649]  God, the whites are out to get me.
[02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:40.889]  This country's so fricking horrible.
[02:12:41.369 --> 02:12:41.569]  Yeah.
[02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:42.370]  Let's go to Vox Day, Vox.
[02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.670]  I tell you.
[02:12:47.045 --> 02:12:56.949]  This is so far gone that if the left and the globalists win, it's making whites become racially based, it's destroying the egalitarian contract, and whites will have to form white homelands.
[02:12:57.229 --> 02:13:00.851]  So this is the absolute attempt at destruction of the country, Fox.
[02:13:02.232 --> 02:13:05.073]  Well yeah, it's been baked in the cake since 1965.
[02:13:07.194 --> 02:13:14.197]  When you look at the opening of the United States to the rest of the world, and the
[02:13:15.522 --> 02:13:16.282]  Exactly.
[02:13:16.362 --> 02:13:24.126]  They're all racially or culturally based, and they all, whether they're Asian or whatever, kill the group that isn't in their tribe.
[02:13:37.862 --> 02:13:38.702]  We are Christians.
[02:13:38.782 --> 02:13:41.203]  We bring people in and think, oh, you'll be like us.
[02:13:41.263 --> 02:13:47.184]  But the left comes in and goes, no, we're going to program them to go back to what they came from, which will be a winning strategy.
[02:13:47.844 --> 02:13:48.024]  Yeah.
[02:13:48.325 --> 02:13:50.585]  No, I mean, look at just the beginning of that.
[02:13:50.625 --> 02:13:54.586]  They're literally holding up pictures of Jewish people and having all the kids go, ew, gross.
[02:13:54.686 --> 02:13:56.686]  Look, I mean, that's literal Nazi.
[02:13:56.887 --> 02:13:59.367]  And that was exactly very sickeningly done.
[02:13:59.407 --> 02:14:00.387]  Vox, this is next level.
[02:14:01.768 --> 02:14:02.628]  Well, there's no question.
[02:14:02.668 --> 02:14:07.129]  And what I think was particularly interesting about it, and it's something that I think that
[02:14:08.050 --> 02:14:30.878]  Those who are focused on the left-right dichotomy and the white-black dichotomy tend to miss is that there is absolutely a Jewish-Asian rivalry in general and a Jewish-Chinese rivalry in specific that is beginning to play out in the United States and Canada.
[02:14:31.379 --> 02:14:34.800]  If you look at the lawsuit that is taking place against Harvard,
[02:14:35.757 --> 02:14:59.578]  If you look at what is beginning to take place in both the video game and the movie industry, what you see is Chinese money coming in and competing with the traditional Jewish money interest, while at the same time, there's a pretty intense rivalry going on
[02:15:00.123 --> 02:15:02.944]  For the limited number of places at the Ivy League universities.
[02:15:15.649 --> 02:15:24.331]  They kind of carry the Hitlerian idea that Jews run everything and they see that as the rival group they're targeting and now you're even seeing it in a group of young Asians being brainwashed.
[02:15:24.371 --> 02:15:26.272]  This is so sophisticated.
[02:15:26.552 --> 02:15:28.152]  This is the real stuff, folks, you're getting here.
[02:15:28.172 --> 02:15:32.713]  This is not the whole pop thing you see or the cool ultra right-wing thing hating Jews.
[02:15:33.053 --> 02:15:34.554]  This is what's really going on.
[02:15:34.814 --> 02:15:35.394]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:38.422 --> 02:15:42.690]  There's only four days left at InfoWareStore.com on one of the biggest sales we've ever had.
[02:15:42.711 --> 02:15:47.260]  67% off blowout sale and free shipping storewide.
[02:15:54.855 --> 02:15:59.640]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:16.677]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[02:16:17.158 --> 02:16:17.798]  But is it true?
[02:16:18.699 --> 02:16:25.190]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[02:16:26.172 --> 02:16:29.737]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[02:16:30.679 --> 02:16:32.101]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[02:16:32.967 --> 02:16:36.108]  And so the establishment wants us off the air at any cost.
[02:16:36.149 --> 02:16:38.650]  Because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming.
[02:16:39.090 --> 02:16:41.191]  Live every day from 11 a.m.
[02:16:41.711 --> 02:16:42.011]  to 3 p.m.
[02:16:42.031 --> 02:16:42.952]  just on my show.
[02:16:43.092 --> 02:16:45.653]  And you got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[02:16:45.693 --> 02:16:46.013]  Central.
[02:16:46.213 --> 02:16:49.915]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:16:49.935 --> 02:16:50.535]  in the War Room.
[02:16:50.775 --> 02:16:52.756]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[02:16:52.776 --> 02:16:53.977]  They're trying to block that.
[02:16:54.864 --> 02:16:58.646]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[02:16:59.326 --> 02:17:06.469]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[02:17:06.970 --> 02:17:09.471]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[02:17:10.271 --> 02:17:25.011]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers, not let us advertise online, kick us off PayPal, kick us off Facebook, kick us off Twitter, kick us off YouTube, and over a hundred other platforms now, where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[02:17:25.732 --> 02:17:33.779]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[02:17:33.839 --> 02:17:35.881]  That's because we are on target.
[02:17:35.941 --> 02:17:38.083]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[02:17:38.123 --> 02:17:40.024]  We're exposing their main operation.
[02:17:40.565 --> 02:17:42.126]  Look, I know you guys know that.
[02:17:42.567 --> 02:17:43.427]  That's why you've supported us.
[02:17:43.467 --> 02:17:49.572]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:17:50.793 --> 02:17:52.715]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[02:17:52.735 --> 02:18:02.983]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[02:18:03.364 --> 02:18:04.405]  To hand-share those links.
[02:18:04.465 --> 02:18:06.026]  To text message people.
[02:18:06.406 --> 02:18:08.489]  Information you think is particularly important.
[02:18:08.529 --> 02:18:09.851]  To get around the censors.
[02:18:09.891 --> 02:18:11.253]  Nothing can stop your word of mouth.
[02:18:11.733 --> 02:18:15.398]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[02:18:15.538 --> 02:18:18.362]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[02:18:18.402 --> 02:18:24.630]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[02:18:26.926 --> 02:18:30.289]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:32.470]  They're all there at thefullrestore.com.
[02:18:32.510 --> 02:18:33.091]  Patriot apparel.
[02:18:33.771 --> 02:18:34.292]  It's all there.
[02:18:35.593 --> 02:18:43.098]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items.
[02:18:46.921 --> 02:19:00.797]  We already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[02:19:01.678 --> 02:19:04.619]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[02:19:05.019 --> 02:19:09.420]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:16.302]  So please take advantage of them today at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:16.682 --> 02:19:18.063]  Everybody loves Rainforest.
[02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:19.523]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[02:19:19.923 --> 02:19:20.244]  30% off.
[02:19:20.484 --> 02:19:22.104]  Everybody really loves Mercurial Silver.
[02:19:22.284 --> 02:19:24.705]  Highest quality, 67% off, silver bullet.
[02:19:25.405 --> 02:19:31.771]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:31.791 --> 02:19:37.857]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[02:19:41.781 --> 02:19:44.384]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:58.119 --> 02:20:05.741]  You know, I'm not really proud of this designation, but at the same time I'm proud that we've told the truth and done the right things to have the establishment give us this designation.
[02:20:06.241 --> 02:20:16.944]  We are the most demonized, the most lied about, the most hated group, because with our guests and the whole compendium of what we do at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, the radio, the TV, the films, the special reports,
[02:20:18.604 --> 02:20:29.335]  ...is expose the real power structure of the world and the different competing groups that want the general public to be totally unaware of this and the fact that the globalists have decided to bring down the West.
[02:20:29.375 --> 02:20:32.178]  Now, Vox, you got us some intriguing things there.
[02:20:32.258 --> 02:20:33.399]  Vox Day joins us.
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:37.003]  Again, you can go to voxday.blogspot.com.
[02:20:38.169 --> 02:20:48.460]  And, um, Boxversity on YouTube, and he's got Alt Hero, the comic book company that we sell his great comic books that sell off and sell out constantly when they come in.
[02:20:48.841 --> 02:20:49.441]  Alt Hero.
[02:20:50.382 --> 02:20:52.885]  We'll cover that more and take some calls coming up the next segment.
[02:20:53.866 --> 02:21:04.490]  Vox, getting into, everybody thinks about America as the only place in the world, but there's seven plus million people outside of this, and the real rivalries and the real tribalism that goes on.
[02:21:04.510 --> 02:21:11.972]  You were getting into China and its rivalry with planetary, in their word, Jewry, and all the rest of this.
[02:21:11.992 --> 02:21:14.653]  So from your deep research, what's really going on?
[02:21:16.814 --> 02:21:19.495]  Well, the West is in decline.
[02:21:20.235 --> 02:21:23.176]  The West has been in decline more or less
[02:21:23.965 --> 02:21:25.967]  Since the early 20th century.
[02:21:27.008 --> 02:21:34.374]  And so this is a topic of a great deal of concern from the leaders of the West.
[02:21:35.315 --> 02:21:50.329]  This is also a great deal of concern to the various tribes and nations outside the West because some of them see this as an opportunity and they see it as a way to exercise their national ambitions.
[02:21:51.385 --> 02:21:58.987]  Others see it as something to fear, because they have perhaps been defended by the dominance of the West.
[02:21:59.768 --> 02:22:11.791]  And so, it's happened so subtly that a lot of people don't even recognize that it's happened, but the United States is no longer a global superpower.
[02:22:12.772 --> 02:22:20.574]  You know, even during the Cold War, the United States had more ability to effectively intervene around the world
[02:22:21.235 --> 02:22:22.016]  Than it does now.
[02:22:22.756 --> 02:22:30.723]  But we've now reached a point where China is a regional power that is stronger in its region than the United States.
[02:22:30.743 --> 02:22:35.146]  And by the way, the Pentagon put a report out yesterday saying just this, that we're no longer the dominant force.
[02:22:36.728 --> 02:22:42.672]  Yeah, I mean, they're acknowledging what those of us who have been paying attention to this for the last 20 years already knew.
[02:22:42.692 --> 02:22:48.997]  You know, the late Jerry Pornell created an excellent science fiction series.
[02:22:49.037 --> 02:22:49.558]  It was part
[02:22:51.090 --> 02:22:53.551]  It was part fiction and part real.
[02:22:53.611 --> 02:23:02.293]  He would get leading military thinkers to contribute actual articles, and then you'd have short stories that would sort of illustrate them.
[02:23:02.393 --> 02:23:07.495]  It's called There Will Be War, and he published nine of them.
[02:23:07.535 --> 02:23:15.137]  We revived the series, and he and I put out Volume 10, and we're planning to continue the series in his honor with Volume 11.
[02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:28.943]  But when you look at the way that the military balance changed over time, you can even see in the late 80s how the balance of power was beginning to shift.
[02:23:29.483 --> 02:23:41.466]  And so now the United States is not only not the global superpower, but it's not even a power equivalent to what it used to be.
[02:23:42.390 --> 02:23:59.562]  Let's be clear, we could have been the total power if we promoted freedom and strength and didn't sell out, but it was parlayed into a global order for corporations to try to have some type of dominance into the future, but really they've just handed power to the communist Chinese and others.
[02:23:59.642 --> 02:24:09.909]  And I want your view on this, but expanding on that, if you pull back and you look at it, when China gets dominance, which the CFR has been planning, which we just showed on screen,
[02:24:11.195 --> 02:24:18.058]  By 2030, that means we acquiesce to their regulations, their censorship, and we see big tech already doing it.
[02:24:18.118 --> 02:24:20.519]  So, it just doesn't mean that we're not the dominant power.
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:26.062]  It means the best part of the West, freedom, private property, all of it, it's gone.
[02:24:26.582 --> 02:24:27.343]  It's going to be gone.
[02:24:27.383 --> 02:24:28.443]  It's going to be hellish.
[02:24:28.783 --> 02:24:37.067]  And I see Trump trying to stomp the brakes on this, and I just see the psychically poisoned population basically begging for their own destruction.
[02:24:37.087 --> 02:24:37.988]  It's very, very sad, Vox.
[02:24:39.403 --> 02:24:49.048]  Well, I think that you need to keep in mind that the globalists are not as in control as we sometimes imagine them to be.
[02:24:49.168 --> 02:24:49.728]  I totally agree.
[02:24:49.748 --> 02:24:54.170]  Kissinger says they're always trying to control and get power out of a new order.
[02:24:56.411 --> 02:25:00.793]  Well, not only that, but to a certain extent, they have, they're riding a tiger.
[02:25:01.934 --> 02:25:08.057]  And, you know, when you put yourself at the front of the parade and you're riding on the back of a tiger,
[02:25:08.973 --> 02:25:09.233]  I agree.
[02:25:27.263 --> 02:25:34.645]  Well, they should have never allowed it to have all of our energy and power.
[02:25:34.765 --> 02:25:35.965]  I mean, they set it up.
[02:25:36.526 --> 02:25:41.267]  Well, give me your view, then, on how they set it up and said Chinese century coming and did all this.
[02:25:41.287 --> 02:25:43.388]  And then, of course, they thought they had seats at the table.
[02:25:43.488 --> 02:25:45.008]  I think the tiger's already thrown them off.
[02:25:45.268 --> 02:25:46.689]  Or the dragon's already thrown them off.
[02:25:48.365 --> 02:25:57.789]  Yeah, I think that if you look at the way, they were totally focused on trying to break the dominance of the Christian West.
[02:25:57.869 --> 02:25:58.149]  Yes.
[02:25:58.289 --> 02:26:04.031]  And so that's why you've seen this centuries-long assault on Christianity.
[02:26:04.711 --> 02:26:11.054]  And so it's very common when you have a dominant and powerful enemy,
[02:26:11.815 --> 02:26:17.437]  To not really pay too much attention to whoever you have to team up with in order to defeat them.
[02:26:17.897 --> 02:26:32.721]  And so I think that to the globalists who wanted to overturn the Western order, the Christian European order, they were thinking, well, you know, the Chinese, they're just
[02:26:33.274 --> 02:26:33.494]  Yeah.
[02:26:45.871 --> 02:26:48.372]  Prostate before the European powers.
[02:26:48.392 --> 02:26:49.693]  Tens of millions of dead.
[02:26:50.573 --> 02:26:53.794]  Broken up by European powers for hundreds of years in colonial sectors.
[02:26:54.435 --> 02:26:56.455]  No running water in 98% of the country.
[02:26:56.996 --> 02:26:58.376]  Just 60 years ago, exactly.
[02:26:58.816 --> 02:27:12.522]  And so, there was such a spiritual obsession with dominating the power of the West by the globalists taking it over, that even though they'd already taken it over, they still had to spike their own weapon in some dumb ritual of their power, and then they just destroyed the main engine they had.
[02:27:14.116 --> 02:27:14.716]  Well, exactly.
[02:27:14.776 --> 02:27:24.579]  And I think that the biggest mistake that they made, and I think this is very typical, I think the biggest mistake that they made was one of arrogance.
[02:27:24.619 --> 02:27:27.539]  They thought, well, we're just so much smarter than everyone else.
[02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:36.622]  But what people have never realized is that the Chinese have a very high level of average intelligence.
[02:27:37.402 --> 02:27:40.983]  You know, they are a very smart people and
[02:27:41.892 --> 02:27:53.535]  Simply being able to access the information base of the West was really all they needed in order to catch up very rapidly.
[02:27:54.116 --> 02:28:05.499]  And so... And we're very easy to buy off now because we're not Christian anymore and really have no values other than hating America, so the left is tailor-made to help merge with the chi-coms and destroy their own
[02:28:08.285 --> 02:28:11.106]  Well, not only that, but the West has been really weakened.
[02:28:11.326 --> 02:28:19.528]  And just to understand, I've been a civic nationalist myself for many years.
[02:28:20.769 --> 02:28:22.109]  We all are to a certain extent.
[02:28:22.589 --> 02:28:34.752]  And that puts all of the peoples of the West in a weaker position when you compare it to the very highly tribalistic nations that are coming out of the East.
[02:28:34.793 --> 02:28:35.253]  Oh, that's right.
[02:28:35.273 --> 02:28:36.413]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:28:40.447 --> 02:28:41.087]  All right, you rolling?
[02:28:43.688 --> 02:28:44.308]  What am I going to say?
[02:28:46.989 --> 02:29:01.234]  There is a corporate consortium of anti-free market monopoly men who have allied themselves with Communist China, the dictatorial EU, America hating Hollywood, and others who think Americans are a bunch of dumb chumps who they can walk in here and rob.
[02:29:01.954 --> 02:29:03.895]  But it was basic American free market liberty
[02:29:05.603 --> 02:29:07.465]  That produced all this incredible wealth.
[02:29:07.965 --> 02:29:17.874]  So we should stand up against globalism, not just for the wealth, but because the globalists are so incredibly oppressive and ally themselves with every horrible form of
[02:29:20.777 --> 02:29:21.397]  Evil regime.
[02:29:21.878 --> 02:29:22.898]  Radical Islam.
[02:29:23.138 --> 02:29:24.259]  The Communist Chinese.
[02:29:24.339 --> 02:29:27.720]  The evil yonker of the EU.
[02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:29.041]  It's just crazy.
[02:29:29.601 --> 02:29:31.102]  Of course we can beat these people.
[02:29:31.502 --> 02:29:33.083]  Of course they can be stopped.
[02:29:33.263 --> 02:29:36.585]  But we have to stand against them and say no to their operation.
[02:29:37.045 --> 02:29:39.966]  I used to always wonder 30 years ago why we couldn't defeat the globalists.
[02:29:40.506 --> 02:29:43.368]  Then about 25 years ago I got politically involved.
[02:29:43.588 --> 02:29:44.568]  23 years ago I got on air.
[02:29:44.648 --> 02:29:45.329]  Then I learned why.
[02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:46.950]  Because you get fired.
[02:29:47.470 --> 02:29:48.730]  Because you get demonized.
[02:29:48.750 --> 02:29:49.791]  Because you get sued.
[02:29:49.991 --> 02:29:51.473]  Because you get physically assaulted.
[02:29:52.915 --> 02:29:54.817]  And the globalists are betting you're a bunch of cowards.
[02:29:55.398 --> 02:29:57.741]  And so you'll never stick your head up because you don't want that to happen.
[02:29:58.602 --> 02:30:04.269]  But instead, you have your whole birthright stolen, you become a slave, and you die a thousand deaths instead of one death.
[02:30:04.289 --> 02:30:07.593]  Well, I'd rather die that one death instead of a thousand, but we don't have to die.
[02:30:08.902 --> 02:30:10.864]  We've simply got to get engaged.
[02:30:11.024 --> 02:30:13.586]  They fear the InfoWars audience, because you're not a regular audience.
[02:30:13.646 --> 02:30:18.931]  You are men and women in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about in that beautiful speech.
[02:30:19.712 --> 02:30:22.475]  And that's why I know we're going to win.
[02:30:22.615 --> 02:30:29.662]  Because of you, every race, color, and creed who have red blood, who believe in liberty, I stand with you, you stand with me, and it's amazing.
[02:30:30.322 --> 02:30:31.822]  That's why we're launching another initiative.
[02:30:32.443 --> 02:30:36.924]  I know it got Trump's attention when I sent 100,000 letters to him a year and a half ago about internet censorship.
[02:30:37.444 --> 02:30:41.785]  We're going to send a million letters at writetrump.com.
[02:30:41.845 --> 02:30:43.305]  You can print it off yourself and mail it.
[02:30:44.145 --> 02:30:45.506]  That way two letters go per person.
[02:30:45.546 --> 02:30:49.267]  But regardless, I'm going to mail it in an envelope to the White House.
[02:30:49.347 --> 02:30:49.867]  I want to send
[02:30:51.308 --> 02:30:56.530]  About 80% of whatever we get in, I hope it'll be a million, that's up to you, to the White House.
[02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:59.552]  Another 100,000 in Mar-a-Lago, another 100,000 in Trump Tower.
[02:30:59.832 --> 02:31:09.517]  So there's no way the President isn't knee-deep in these and he pays attention to a letter, he sees that as like 10,000 emails that you took action, that you got involved.
[02:31:09.637 --> 02:31:16.180]  Separately, when you sign up, we'll be able to send you alerts about the fight against censorship and against the globalists.
[02:31:17.927 --> 02:31:18.927]  RightTrump.com.
[02:31:18.967 --> 02:31:21.528]  Go read the letter that Roger Stone and I have written to the President.
[02:31:21.588 --> 02:31:23.649]  You can add your own or just send it alone.
[02:31:24.149 --> 02:31:25.690]  Again, print it off, send it yourself.
[02:31:25.770 --> 02:31:26.990]  We're going to send it regardless.
[02:31:27.331 --> 02:31:27.911]  It's so easy.
[02:31:27.951 --> 02:31:28.971]  Go spend two minutes.
[02:31:29.451 --> 02:31:30.212]  Go to RightTrump.com.
[02:31:31.565 --> 02:31:32.525]  Sign up and send a letter.
[02:31:32.765 --> 02:31:34.086]  It'll be legitimately from you.
[02:31:34.366 --> 02:31:39.947]  Hopefully you add something to it so that it'll be a two-page letter, not just our letter, and this will have a big effect.
[02:31:40.407 --> 02:31:42.367]  And regardless, it gets the globalist's attention.
[02:31:42.647 --> 02:31:43.508]  So we're not laying down.
[02:31:43.528 --> 02:31:46.648]  We're not just curling up in a ball in a fetal position and taking all this crap.
[02:31:47.008 --> 02:31:49.689]  Trump has said he's getting ready for antitrust action against big tech.
[02:31:50.009 --> 02:31:53.090]  He's getting ready to take on the globalist media that is the enemy of the people.
[02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:59.571]  We have to stand with the president now more than ever, and we have to let him know there's a coalition of a million people
[02:32:01.269 --> 02:32:02.872]  Found an organization very soon as well.
[02:32:03.152 --> 02:32:05.997]  That's another reason to come sign up with us so I can stay in contact with you.
[02:32:06.017 --> 02:32:10.924]  But this is phase one to show the President that we're sending him a million real letters.
[02:32:12.130 --> 02:32:13.551]  It's all about to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:13.871 --> 02:32:18.694]  We can do it if you take action and tell others to take action at WriteTrump.com.
[02:32:18.754 --> 02:32:33.021]  So go there yourself, text message, email your friends, neighbors, family and tell them, get involved and stand up to Apple, stand up to Google, stand up to Facebook, stand up to Twitter and let them know America is unifying, America and the world is organizing and taking action.
[02:32:33.562 --> 02:32:34.262]  God bless you all.
[02:32:41.721 --> 02:32:45.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:52.966 --> 02:32:55.147]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:55.627 --> 02:33:00.949]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:01.650 --> 02:33:07.192]  You know, Vox Dei is a really smart guy, and he doesn't do a lot of other interviews, so I'm glad he comes on with us.
[02:33:08.132 --> 02:33:09.413]  And I've read
[02:33:10.774 --> 02:33:15.255]  A lot of what the globalists write, and I've read a lot of what the communist Chinese write, and I've read a lot of what the Russians write.
[02:33:16.376 --> 02:33:31.440]  And there really is this weird leftist, anti-Christian system, because that was the old dominant system, was Christianity in the West, where they just are always at war with that, when that's a system that creates wealth and innovation and success.
[02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:35.641]  So they're destroying the very system that actually let
[02:33:36.966 --> 02:33:43.095]  The occultist and the weirdos and everybody do what they want, but now they want control over speech.
[02:33:43.195 --> 02:33:44.256]  They want control over everything.
[02:33:44.516 --> 02:33:48.982]  They want their own weird authoritarianism that's all diametrically opposed to Christianity.
[02:33:49.543 --> 02:33:50.505]  It's really Satanism.
[02:33:52.011 --> 02:33:58.034]  And then meanwhile, here come the Chi-Coms, who won't let any of their leftist propaganda in any of it, who kill gays, who, you know, everything.
[02:33:58.394 --> 02:34:04.978]  And they're just marching in, buying up Hollywood, buying up the debt, buying up control of everything.
[02:34:05.098 --> 02:34:06.479]  And this clash is coming.
[02:34:07.159 --> 02:34:08.560]  This clash is expanding.
[02:34:08.620 --> 02:34:11.181]  And the Chi-Coms are allied with the authoritarian EU.
[02:34:11.601 --> 02:34:13.122]  We've seen the big Brexit betrayal.
[02:34:13.462 --> 02:34:14.343]  Vox is in Europe.
[02:34:15.083 --> 02:34:17.525]  So Vox, big picture then, these different power structures,
[02:34:18.661 --> 02:34:21.903]  Get into the most important points you want to make to people, because folks understand.
[02:34:21.923 --> 02:34:33.351]  If you tune into CNBC or MSNBC or ABC, you're getting politically total dribble that has nothing to do with anything except confusing people and sabotaging culture.
[02:34:33.411 --> 02:34:34.492]  They admit their own documents.
[02:34:35.192 --> 02:34:42.717]  And then it's so frustrating to read what the actual controllers say, as you do, as I do, to know the reality that no one should be for this.
[02:34:43.357 --> 02:34:45.479]  Not even anti-Christian, you know, crazies, but
[02:34:46.974 --> 02:34:51.916]  They still just don't care because they have been raised into this cult of hating the West.
[02:34:52.197 --> 02:34:53.637]  So how do you see all this unfolding?
[02:34:55.678 --> 02:34:58.180]  Well, you first asked me to give my advice.
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:04.163]  And so my advice is to let go of your assumptions.
[02:35:05.583 --> 02:35:14.968]  All the assumptions that you have about how people should behave and start looking at how people actually do behave.
[02:35:16.430 --> 02:35:29.240]  Especially those of us on the right, we tend to have a very romanticized view of Enlightenment ideals, American Revolutionary ideals, the Constitution, etc.
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:30.741]  And that's fine.
[02:35:32.282 --> 02:35:34.324]  Ideals exist for a reason.
[02:35:35.284 --> 02:35:41.970]  But where you make a mistake and where you get into danger is where you start substituting your ideals for reality.
[02:35:45.615 --> 02:36:01.561]  And so, what we are beginning to see is that a lot of the ideas and the ideals that we in the Christian West believed were universal are not in fact valued by most of the rest of the globe.
[02:36:02.721 --> 02:36:08.223]  And so, we also need to recognize that we don't make the rules anymore.
[02:36:09.503 --> 02:36:13.725]  The game that we're playing has different rules
[02:36:14.528 --> 02:36:17.530]  Then the rules that applied when the West was completely in charge.
[02:36:18.270 --> 02:36:27.176]  And so that's going to be a very difficult process and maybe an impossible one for people of our generation for the average person of our generation.
[02:36:27.196 --> 02:36:36.802]  You know, our assumption has always been that, well, nobody would want to do something that stupid because everyone would be worse off.
[02:36:37.002 --> 02:36:38.463]  Everyone would be more poor.
[02:36:39.563 --> 02:36:43.426]  But if you look at what the big tech companies have done to you,
[02:36:44.753 --> 02:36:57.620]  If you look at what the companies like Facebook and Twitter and PayPal are doing, they have essentially transformed the digital economy into a third world economy.
[02:36:58.140 --> 02:37:03.403]  And what I mean by that is they have created an economy where contracts don't exist.
[02:37:04.904 --> 02:37:06.565]  Reliability does not exist.
[02:37:06.685 --> 02:37:08.206]  Accountability does not exist.
[02:37:08.906 --> 02:37:11.908]  You have to simply you don't know one day to the next.
[02:37:12.617 --> 02:37:23.283]  Whether you're going to be able to buy something or pay something, that is literally the description of a third world country, a third world economy.
[02:37:23.783 --> 02:37:38.071]  Hernando de Soto, the economist, has won a number of awards for pointing out that one reason why the third world is so poor is because they have no contract law and there is no reliability to business transactions.
[02:37:38.571 --> 02:37:41.353]  And that is what we have created
[02:37:42.228 --> 02:37:43.369]  With the internet economy now.
[02:38:02.543 --> 02:38:05.625]  To make them even more extreme, more bullying, and more out of control.
[02:38:05.986 --> 02:38:16.333]  And the slippery slope, just in six months, there's been more censorship, and more harassment, and more deplatforming, and more removal of people's right to commerce than we saw in the last hundred years combined.
[02:38:16.373 --> 02:38:22.598]  So we're going down the slope now, and if we could stop it, punish them, pull back,
[02:38:23.655 --> 02:38:25.176]  Yeah, there's a cartoon that expresses it very well where
[02:38:51.223 --> 02:39:08.932]  There's an individual sitting on the branch of a tree and he's high up off the ground and he's busily sawing at the branch of the tree because he hates the branch of the tree, but he doesn't realize that he's going to fall down as soon as he finishes cutting through it.
[02:39:09.512 --> 02:39:19.837]  And that's the position that the left is in, but the problem that we face on the right is that we cannot and will not be able to convince them
[02:39:20.632 --> 02:39:22.493]  That cutting off the branch is a bad idea.
[02:39:22.993 --> 02:39:23.954]  They don't believe us.
[02:39:24.895 --> 02:39:38.263]  And they wouldn't be on the left if they actually had the capability of accepting logic and being able to correctly anticipate the consequences of their actions.
[02:39:39.083 --> 02:39:47.409]  And so, you know, a lot of people describe me as being, you know, this far right extremist, whatever.
[02:39:48.529 --> 02:39:49.570]  But the reality is,
[02:39:50.316 --> 02:40:00.143]  I'm simply watching what's happening, comparing it to what's happened in the past, and just observing the obvious.
[02:40:01.003 --> 02:40:07.668]  The things that I'm talking about are not things that I want to happen, they're things that are happening and are going to happen.
[02:40:07.788 --> 02:40:09.589]  Well sure, take the globalist left.
[02:40:09.709 --> 02:40:17.715]  They think they're going to ally with radical Islam into the future and dominate the world, but radical Islam is going to slit their throat so fast it'll make their head spin.
[02:40:19.079 --> 02:40:21.761]  Well, that's one bizarre thing.
[02:40:22.261 --> 02:40:26.563]  Another bizarre thing is you see writers like David Spengler.
[02:40:27.824 --> 02:40:29.925]  He calls himself Spengler.
[02:40:29.965 --> 02:40:31.226]  His name is David Goldberg, actually.
[02:40:31.886 --> 02:40:38.730]  And he's constantly writing about this amazing respect that the Chinese have for the Jews.
[02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:46.034]  And every time I read his article, I think, David, they see you as their main rival.
[02:40:46.843 --> 02:40:51.926]  You know, they're not going to team up with you against the United States.
[02:40:52.806 --> 02:40:56.868]  Their whole goal is to dominate both parties.
[02:40:57.468 --> 02:41:13.336]  And so, you know, it boggles my mind that so many people somehow think that they're going to finesse and maneuver their way around these massive historical forces and these great nations that have survived for millennia.
[02:41:17.518 --> 02:41:19.300]  Is there any path out of this?
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:24.004]  Is there any way to reach a brainwashed leftist to stop sabotaging their own nest?
[02:41:24.064 --> 02:41:25.226]  Is there any way to get through to them?
[02:41:27.107 --> 02:41:28.189]  I don't believe so.
[02:41:28.229 --> 02:41:31.372]  And let me explain my justification for saying this.
[02:41:32.353 --> 02:41:41.842]  I was interviewed by the largest comics site about two weeks ago, two or three weeks ago.
[02:41:43.301 --> 02:41:57.235]  And they wrote a 17,000 word interview where they went into incredible detail, mostly because they wanted to inoculate themselves against being accused of somehow sympathizing with me.
[02:41:57.275 --> 02:42:03.541]  So basically, they would ask a question, I would answer it, and then they would explain why they disagreed with it.
[02:42:03.781 --> 02:42:04.422]  So it's very long.
[02:42:05.371 --> 02:42:14.300]  And one of the things that we disagreed about was I said that there's no way to negotiate or compromise with the SJWs, with the radical left.
[02:42:15.241 --> 02:42:20.026]  And this poor editor, he said, no, I think you're wrong.
[02:42:20.046 --> 02:42:22.829]  I think, you know, we can talk like this.
[02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:25.632]  If we can talk, everybody can talk and so forth.
[02:42:26.613 --> 02:42:28.235]  So the article ran.
[02:42:29.099 --> 02:42:31.181]  And the next day... Hold on, Cliff Hanger.
[02:42:31.221 --> 02:42:32.162]  The article ran next day.
[02:42:32.182 --> 02:42:33.283]  We'll recap this straight ahead.
[02:42:33.323 --> 02:42:33.984]  I meant to go to calls.
[02:42:34.044 --> 02:42:34.425]  I apologize.
[02:42:34.465 --> 02:42:34.985]  We're out of time.
[02:42:35.005 --> 02:42:36.427]  We're going to come back with more of the Vox Day.
[02:42:36.447 --> 02:42:37.307]  This is riveting stuff.
[02:42:37.828 --> 02:42:42.112]  There's only four days left at InfoWarsTore.com on one of the biggest sales we've ever had.
[02:42:42.132 --> 02:42:46.677]  67% off, blowout sale, and free shipping storewide.
[02:42:54.272 --> 02:42:59.053]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[02:42:59.073 --> 02:43:16.058]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[02:43:16.538 --> 02:43:17.178]  But is it true?
[02:43:18.098 --> 02:43:24.600]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[02:43:25.581 --> 02:43:29.002]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[02:43:29.022 --> 02:43:31.443]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[02:43:32.423 --> 02:43:35.306]  So the establishment wants us off the air at 8 p.m.
[02:43:35.326 --> 02:43:38.809]  Because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming.
[02:43:38.829 --> 02:43:40.591]  Live every day from 11 a.m.
[02:43:40.951 --> 02:43:41.391]  to 3 p.m.
[02:43:41.451 --> 02:43:42.352]  just on my show.
[02:43:42.633 --> 02:43:45.055]  Then you got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[02:43:45.115 --> 02:43:45.435]  Central.
[02:43:45.876 --> 02:43:49.299]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:43:49.339 --> 02:43:49.959]  in the War Room.
[02:43:50.060 --> 02:43:52.182]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[02:43:52.202 --> 02:43:53.403]  They're trying to block that.
[02:43:54.281 --> 02:43:58.064]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[02:43:58.744 --> 02:44:05.789]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[02:44:06.369 --> 02:44:08.891]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[02:44:09.671 --> 02:44:13.693]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers and not let us advertise online.
[02:44:14.313 --> 02:44:17.974]  Kick us off PayPal, kick us off Facebook, kick us off Twitter, kick us off YouTube.
[02:44:18.034 --> 02:44:24.577]  And over a hundred other platforms now, where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[02:44:25.157 --> 02:44:33.202]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[02:44:33.262 --> 02:44:35.284]  That's because we are on target.
[02:44:35.364 --> 02:44:37.485]  We're exposing the globalist paradigm.
[02:44:37.545 --> 02:44:39.426]  We're exposing their main operation.
[02:44:39.947 --> 02:44:41.548]  Look, I know you guys know that.
[02:44:41.988 --> 02:44:42.849]  That's why you've supported us.
[02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:48.933]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:44:50.214 --> 02:44:52.157]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[02:44:52.177 --> 02:45:02.431]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[02:45:02.791 --> 02:45:04.894]  To hand-share those links, to text message people.
[02:45:05.835 --> 02:45:07.897]  Information you think is particularly important.
[02:45:07.937 --> 02:45:09.279]  To get around the censors.
[02:45:09.319 --> 02:45:10.660]  Nothing can stop the word of mouth.
[02:45:11.141 --> 02:45:14.724]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[02:45:14.944 --> 02:45:17.767]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[02:45:17.827 --> 02:45:24.013]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[02:45:26.534 --> 02:45:29.695]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:45:30.135 --> 02:45:31.696]  They're all there at thefullrestore.com.
[02:45:31.916 --> 02:45:32.536]  Patriot apparel.
[02:45:33.196 --> 02:45:33.697]  It's all there.
[02:45:34.997 --> 02:45:42.480]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items.
[02:45:48.324 --> 02:46:00.197]  We already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[02:46:01.098 --> 02:46:04.020]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:08.823]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[02:46:08.863 --> 02:46:15.707]  So please take advantage of them today at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:16.108 --> 02:46:17.549]  Everybody loves Rainforest.
[02:46:17.569 --> 02:46:18.929]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[02:46:19.350 --> 02:46:19.690]  30% off.
[02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:21.511]  Everybody really loves our colloidal silver.
[02:46:21.631 --> 02:46:23.412]  Highest quality, 67% off, silver bullet.
[02:46:24.833 --> 02:46:31.199]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:31.219 --> 02:46:37.285]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[02:46:41.208 --> 02:46:43.851]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:56.633 --> 02:46:56.933]  All right.
[02:46:59.574 --> 02:47:01.815]  Fox Day, we're getting into all these subjects.
[02:47:01.855 --> 02:47:06.157]  We carry all the hard copies of the great comic books that are very politically incorrect.
[02:47:06.937 --> 02:47:09.378]  They're not even really that hardcore, but that's why they're so triggering.
[02:47:09.698 --> 02:47:10.538]  But they're very well done.
[02:47:11.239 --> 02:47:13.719]  We carry the first four in the series.
[02:47:13.739 --> 02:47:14.660]  Some new ones are coming out.
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:17.521]  These sell out very, very quickly, but we do have more in stock.
[02:47:17.981 --> 02:47:20.202]  He's got a new book coming out next week, a digital copy.
[02:47:20.222 --> 02:47:21.922]  We'll be carrying it as soon as it's a hard copy.
[02:47:22.403 --> 02:47:25.724]  And that's Jordanetics, A Journey into the Mind of Humanity's Greatest Thinker.
[02:47:27.278 --> 02:47:31.560]  You know, they claim he got censored at his university for saying that there are men and women and no other genders.
[02:47:31.580 --> 02:47:40.105]  I think the guy sounds pretty smart on many levels, but then I noticed that they never censor him and they push him and they promote him and then...
[02:47:41.374 --> 02:47:44.155]  You know, he said, oh, Alex Jones, they bet off more than they could choose censoring him.
[02:47:44.575 --> 02:47:52.278]  But then I also see his little cohort, people that run with him, working with him, you know, really not saying a word about the censorship and going along with all this.
[02:47:52.378 --> 02:47:56.419]  I have no heart on for, in a bad way for, you know, Jordan Peterson.
[02:47:56.439 --> 02:48:00.041]  But I do think it's important to see the system really embracing him.
[02:48:00.081 --> 02:48:00.681]  It's kind of like
[02:48:02.022 --> 02:48:17.838]  Peter Joseph, that's a fake name, with the whole Zeitgeist movement that we were told was the second coming of Christ, and the UN having meetings and all this, and there's going to be a magic computer that puts you in a plastic sports stadium, and there'll be no more money, but the technocrats will run everything.
[02:48:18.118 --> 02:48:19.119]  Well, that's what the globalists want.
[02:48:19.139 --> 02:48:20.200]  That's what Michael Bloomberg wants.
[02:48:20.741 --> 02:48:22.923]  And that guy said, you'll be sent to a re-education camp.
[02:48:24.178 --> 02:48:26.140]  He talks in a voice like this, Alex.
[02:48:26.921 --> 02:48:28.422]  I'll come back on if you apologize.
[02:48:28.482 --> 02:48:32.567]  I never said he'd be sent to re-education camp, though he did say it on air.
[02:48:33.327 --> 02:48:36.190]  So, I mean, I do see when something's being pushed.
[02:48:36.230 --> 02:48:36.671]  Kind of like...
[02:48:37.779 --> 02:48:43.201]  The Q movement was being pushed and said that, you know, stay with the plan, Sessions is great, he'll never be fired.
[02:48:43.521 --> 02:48:45.462]  And then, oh, but I'm a Fed, I'm going to be arrested.
[02:48:45.622 --> 02:48:48.683]  I mean, I talk to high-level folks as high as you can go.
[02:48:49.604 --> 02:48:51.304]  They couldn't stand Sessions, what was going on.
[02:48:51.865 --> 02:48:54.306]  But, oh, magic Q, magic show.
[02:48:54.686 --> 02:48:58.267]  I mean, there is a Q shmell to Jordan Peters.
[02:48:58.447 --> 02:49:02.249]  Let's spend a few minutes on that and then back into big picture and where you think Trump's going.
[02:49:05.387 --> 02:49:09.348]  I think that the book might change your mind about Jordan Peterson.
[02:49:09.388 --> 02:49:18.090]  In fact, as we speak, he is at the 42nd Annual European Meeting of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:29.072]  And so if you want to talk about globalists, Jordan Peterson is essentially constructing their new religion, their post-Christian ethic.
[02:49:29.858 --> 02:49:33.321]  And so that's what the book delves into.
[02:49:34.562 --> 02:49:42.449]  I understand the establishment likes him and I understand that he's enticing conservatives and nationalists right now with one construct.
[02:49:42.509 --> 02:49:44.631]  You're saying he's someone else entirely.
[02:49:45.071 --> 02:49:46.993]  And I believe you and I see evidence of that.
[02:49:47.393 --> 02:49:52.797]  Quantify why you're saying he's so dangerous being set up as their new Timothy Leary or their new super guru.
[02:49:53.258 --> 02:49:54.379]  And I can't wait to read the book.
[02:49:54.399 --> 02:49:55.239]  I mean, quantify.
[02:49:55.259 --> 02:49:58.042]  And I am aware he is at the trilateral meeting right now.
[02:49:59.437 --> 02:49:59.698]  Yeah.
[02:50:00.579 --> 02:50:06.809]  Jordan Peterson's primary goal is to save the human race by ending war.
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:13.584]  And he has decided that the cause for war is group identity.
[02:50:14.124 --> 02:50:22.690]  So therefore, the way that you stop war and bring peace is to eliminate all group identity and bind everyone together.
[02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:24.672]  Well, that's the exact globalist plan.
[02:50:24.912 --> 02:50:28.114]  But then he attacks all these fake identity politics groups that are leftist.
[02:50:28.375 --> 02:50:29.816]  That makes us think he's our ally.
[02:50:29.836 --> 02:50:31.577]  But really, all the identities must go.
[02:50:32.904 --> 02:50:33.404]  Precisely.
[02:50:33.484 --> 02:50:34.425]  He's a gatekeeper.
[02:50:34.485 --> 02:50:35.546]  He's like Ben Shapiro.
[02:50:36.827 --> 02:50:53.437]  If you notice, ever since William F. Buckley, the right keeps being offered these opinion leaders whose sympathies are at least partially in line with the globalists.
[02:50:53.677 --> 02:50:59.501]  And so that's why, you know, you log into YouTube and it constantly throws
[02:51:00.197 --> 02:51:05.478]  Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro videos, even though you've never watched one.
[02:51:05.558 --> 02:51:11.560]  I mean, I log on to YouTube and it's got Ben Shapiro this, Jordan Peterson that.
[02:51:12.940 --> 02:51:23.023]  I only watch Owen Benjamin and Stefan Molyneux and Mike Cernovich, and yet their videos are never, ever recommended to me.
[02:51:24.085 --> 02:51:46.366]  So, we know who's being pushed, and what I wanted to do with Jordan Edex, and what I believe that we've done, is simply show exactly what it is that he's talking about and what it is that he's advocating, because he hides his real message under this word salad that is very, very difficult for the average individual to penetrate.
[02:51:47.262 --> 02:51:54.805]  I'll tell you this, he does have that super arrogance of the left and that just super ego thing.
[02:51:54.825 --> 02:52:00.947]  I mean, I could sit here and do the show and put on those mannerisms and be the whole time.
[02:52:00.967 --> 02:52:03.668]  And you can see when someone is just like trying to project.
[02:52:04.248 --> 02:52:07.689]  And I only see that type of behavior from bad actors generally.
[02:52:08.990 --> 02:52:13.731]  Well, you can't fully understand Jordan Peterson unless you see this 1977 article
[02:52:15.936 --> 02:52:31.780]  from an Edmonton newspaper, and he's 14 years old, and he has this incredibly punchable expression on his face, and the headline is, I won't be happy until I'm elected Prime Minister.
[02:52:33.060 --> 02:52:41.002]  And so, this is somebody who is pathologically ambitious, and yet pretends to be
[02:52:42.686 --> 02:52:47.329]  Post-ideological, not interested in politics, above it all.
[02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:48.490]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:52:50.212 --> 02:52:56.157]  And the amazing thing is, he came within 13 votes of being elected the vice president of the regional party.
[02:52:57.318 --> 02:53:03.363]  So, this is a highly, highly political, highly ambitious guy.
[02:53:03.443 --> 02:53:06.886]  He's actually the equivalent of the really annoying person
[02:53:07.794 --> 02:53:08.695]  On your student body.
[02:53:08.735 --> 02:53:09.875]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:53:09.976 --> 02:53:13.198]  He has that spirit of people lusting for power.
[02:53:14.138 --> 02:53:14.699]  Precisely.
[02:53:15.219 --> 02:53:16.260]  And so he fits in.
[02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:19.342]  I didn't even know that about him in the 14-year-old Illinois.
[02:53:19.362 --> 02:53:24.205]  So you can tell obviously for that position there's been grooming going on behind the scenes.
[02:53:26.212 --> 02:53:28.433]  And notice how he just explodes onto the scene.
[02:53:28.473 --> 02:53:29.533]  Like, take InfoWars.
[02:53:29.594 --> 02:53:32.575]  It took, you know, 15 years to get it to a big level.
[02:53:32.935 --> 02:53:35.416]  And all these other people that took all this time.
[02:53:35.456 --> 02:53:36.937]  This is suddenly just boom!
[02:53:37.517 --> 02:53:40.078]  And he's supposedly anti-establishment, but then he's not.
[02:53:41.479 --> 02:53:46.061]  Well, the thing that's kind of funny is that Peterson's been trying to sell out most of his life.
[02:53:47.121 --> 02:53:49.222]  He just couldn't find any takers until recently.
[02:53:50.823 --> 02:53:52.784]  So, you know, if you
[02:53:54.165 --> 02:54:03.028]  If you are a fan of Jordan Peterson or if you're close to someone who's a fan of Jordan Peterson, I would highly recommend that you read Jordanetics.
[02:54:03.048 --> 02:54:09.451]  We're going to put it on Kindle Unlimited and everything just to make sure that as many people can get access to it as possible.
[02:54:10.851 --> 02:54:20.835]  But, you know, you can't possibly understand how crazy the guy is and how crazy his ideas are.
[02:54:21.491 --> 02:54:24.472]  Until you actually read them for yourself.
[02:54:24.793 --> 02:54:25.933]  No, I get it.
[02:54:26.013 --> 02:54:34.937]  Like any cult group or any political system coming up, it puts out something that's the outer area that it's telling you it's about, once it gets you lured in.
[02:54:35.137 --> 02:54:36.758]  And I've certainly seen that.
[02:54:36.918 --> 02:54:39.239]  But as you said, I know when something's being force-fed.
[02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:41.140]  And I know when something's being blocked.
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:43.501]  They're fighting around the clock to try to block us.
[02:54:43.922 --> 02:54:46.163]  They're totally trying to block all the guys you also named.
[02:54:47.105 --> 02:54:50.749]  And that's because we're not conforming to this, and that's really the big guide.
[02:54:50.769 --> 02:54:54.512]  I mean, look, any QAnon crap was being force-fed everywhere.
[02:54:55.593 --> 02:54:57.055]  So, I mean, now look where that went.
[02:54:59.317 --> 02:55:05.483]  Well, yeah, I think, I mean, I think a lot of us wanted to believe that Q was correct.
[02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:18.291]  We wanted to believe that Trump was going to actually do something, as opposed to constantly threaten and bluster and then, in the end, not necessarily deliver.
[02:55:18.331 --> 02:55:25.672]  For example, today, the headline in Drudge was talking about how Trump says he can throw out the entire press corps.
[02:55:26.293 --> 02:55:29.673]  Well, okay, great, but go ahead and do it.
[02:55:30.653 --> 02:55:34.254]  Just go ahead and don't argue this stuff.
[02:55:35.692 --> 02:55:36.293]  Take action.
[02:55:36.353 --> 02:55:37.273]  Exercise the power.
[02:55:38.694 --> 02:55:45.618]  Exactly, because all the posture, I mean, don't get me wrong, Donald Trump is a great president.
[02:55:45.719 --> 02:55:47.560]  Oh, he's a great guy, absolutely.
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:52.683]  He's facing such aggressive criminality from the globalists, he's got to really take the gloves off.
[02:55:53.944 --> 02:55:58.787]  Exactly, and I think that that's difficult for somebody who is by nature a negotiator.
[02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:02.531]  And exactly, and he keeps thinking, hey, this is good for everybody.
[02:56:02.791 --> 02:56:05.033]  Why would you want to sell America out like you said at the start of the show?
[02:56:05.253 --> 02:56:06.093]  This doesn't make sense.
[02:56:06.374 --> 02:56:07.114]  We have the power.
[02:56:07.154 --> 02:56:08.495]  We could parlay it to something better.
[02:56:08.735 --> 02:56:10.656]  They're like, no, we are a spirit.
[02:56:10.937 --> 02:56:12.638]  We want to mount America's head on the wall.
[02:56:12.998 --> 02:56:17.401]  We hate you too because you're strong and smart and actually negotiate and are chivalrous.
[02:56:17.841 --> 02:56:18.722]  We aren't chivalrous.
[02:56:18.982 --> 02:56:19.843]  We are scumbags.
[02:56:19.983 --> 02:56:22.245]  We are part of the chicken crap dimension.
[02:56:22.505 --> 02:56:24.066]  And we're here to F everyone over.
[02:56:25.148 --> 02:56:29.930]  Well that's why I keep telling people, you need to play by whatever the rules of the game are.
[02:56:29.950 --> 02:56:30.730]  You know, I'm a gamer.
[02:56:31.390 --> 02:56:32.370]  So that's second nature.
[02:56:32.390 --> 02:56:39.313]  So that means we've all got to become election officials and pick big counties that we control and then absolutely steal the election because that's what the Democrats do.
[02:56:40.413 --> 02:56:42.374]  If that's what the rules are, then play by the rules.
[02:56:42.954 --> 02:56:44.174]  It's not a difficult concept.
[02:56:44.354 --> 02:56:54.498]  The important thing is to stop claiming that the only correct way to play football is to run the ball and we can't use this unfair technique called the forward pass.
[02:56:55.171 --> 02:56:56.071]  You know, can you imagine?
[02:56:56.131 --> 02:56:57.032]  No, no, I agree.
[02:56:57.152 --> 02:56:58.612]  They've broken the social contract.
[02:56:58.632 --> 02:57:02.293]  It doesn't mean we're going to now do what they do, but we're in a new ballgame, and that's what I've been saying.
[02:57:02.353 --> 02:57:07.654]  It's like these people are now in total criminal mode, and we've got a serious situation on our hands.
[02:57:07.995 --> 02:57:09.735]  Vox Day, thanks for all the time.
[02:57:09.815 --> 02:57:10.195]  Amazing.
[02:57:10.235 --> 02:57:11.936]  Come back any time we can get you.
[02:57:12.376 --> 02:57:13.516]  Congratulations on everything.
[02:57:13.856 --> 02:57:14.876]  I want to read Jordanetics.
[02:57:14.937 --> 02:57:16.977]  I want to order 10,000 of these babies.
[02:57:17.437 --> 02:57:23.519]  Give me a really good deal on them, and I want to promote this, because everybody asks me about Jordan Peterson, and all I see is demon energy.
[02:57:23.979 --> 02:57:24.820]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:24.860 --> 02:57:25.420]  Stay with us.
[02:57:28.463 --> 02:57:38.450]  Owen Schroer here for InfoWars.com and I want to tell you guys about a great product that we have and it is the Knockout Sleep Aid Formula.

[02:57:53.956 --> 02:58:07.506]  While we're waiting to see the effects of the knockout, I've got some very, very, very important news that I want to get to.
[02:58:10.453 --> 02:58:17.498]  InfoWarsLife wants to bring you a sleep support formula that goes above and beyond other leading brands at an affordable price.
[02:58:17.918 --> 02:58:21.100]  Get the sleep you deserve and experience the power of knockout.

[02:58:25.463 --> 02:58:26.843]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:58:29.196 --> 02:58:29.456]  E.T.
[02:58:29.676 --> 02:58:30.617]  on in Texas.
[02:58:30.917 --> 02:58:32.899]  You're on the air.
[02:58:32.939 --> 02:58:33.379]  Go ahead.
[02:58:33.579 --> 02:58:33.959]  Greetings.
[02:58:33.979 --> 02:58:34.400]  Welcome.
[02:58:59.156 --> 02:59:02.617]  And I hope to hear from you again, and I will always keep in touch with you.
[02:59:02.777 --> 02:59:03.997]  God bless you, Etion.
[02:59:04.157 --> 02:59:05.277]  I never plug Icarin.
[02:59:05.357 --> 02:59:08.938]  All we do is go out and see what is the best product already out there, and make it even stronger and better.
[02:59:08.958 --> 02:59:09.958]  What has the best ratings.
[02:59:09.978 --> 02:59:13.399]  So for kidney and liver, Icarin as a flush, it's powerful.
[02:59:13.439 --> 02:59:16.119]  But if you're already in a weird state, consult a physician.
[02:59:16.139 --> 02:59:20.380]  A lot of companies have a bunch of marketing, but they sell kind of filler because they're scared of real supplements.
[02:59:20.420 --> 02:59:25.341]  I mean, real supplements can really help you, but also, you know, if you're in a weird place, you can get crazy.
[02:59:25.361 --> 02:59:26.781]  So Icarin and InfoWareStore.com.
[02:59:30.618 --> 02:59:34.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:35.241 --> 02:59:36.561]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:44.025 --> 02:59:45.786]  Poets tell how poncho fell.
[02:59:45.826 --> 02:59:48.908]  From the front lines of the information war.
[02:59:49.428 --> 02:59:50.649]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:50.669 --> 02:59:52.870]  The less he did his living in cheap hotels.
[02:59:53.671 --> 02:59:54.211]  Desert's quiet.
[02:59:54.791 --> 02:59:55.632]  Cleveland's cold.
[02:59:55.712 --> 02:59:58.173]  Poets tell how poncho fell.
[02:59:58.193 --> 02:59:59.274]  Little bit of Merle Haggard.
[03:00:00.780 --> 03:00:27.612]  In cheap hotels The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold And so the story ends, we're told I shall need your prayers, it's true But save a few, we're left it too He only did what he had to do And now he's grown old And now he's grown old
[03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:31.220]  Sad to see the beauty of the West fading.
[03:00:32.381 --> 03:00:32.881]  The fall.
[03:00:32.901 --> 03:00:35.761]  The rise of the Antichrist.
[03:00:37.221 --> 03:00:38.342]  The billions that are gonna die.
[03:00:40.302 --> 03:00:44.003]  And God will only let the devil go so long.
[03:00:46.303 --> 03:00:47.143]  But not out of kindness.
[03:00:48.603 --> 03:00:49.404]  Out of our testing.
[03:00:49.964 --> 03:00:50.504]  Our free will.
[03:00:52.524 --> 03:00:53.744]  God doesn't contend with the devil.
[03:00:54.384 --> 03:00:54.704]  We do.
[03:00:56.265 --> 03:00:57.365]  The devil is there to test us.
[03:01:04.238 --> 03:01:08.922]  Alright, we've got Doug Hagman, always informative, coming up for the Balance of the Hour.
[03:01:08.942 --> 03:01:15.328]  I didn't really get a lot into the creepy porn lawyer, Avenatti.
[03:01:15.348 --> 03:01:17.710]  I mean, these people are scum.
[03:01:17.730 --> 03:01:22.735]  And from what I've heard about him, he's really bad.
[03:01:24.485 --> 03:01:27.787]  I mean, he's got like, you know, huge... I'm not gonna even get into all of it.
[03:01:27.887 --> 03:01:30.609]  It's just that these people are total mercenaries.
[03:01:31.329 --> 03:01:40.215]  And I... It's fitting justice that they sent some scumbag in to Tucker Carlson's private club.
[03:01:41.956 --> 03:01:43.997]  And I've experienced this myself, so I'll just leave it at that.
[03:01:44.918 --> 03:01:49.300]  And he came over and confronted one of Tucker's daughters.
[03:01:51.301 --> 03:01:51.422]  And...
[03:01:52.642 --> 03:01:55.603]  Called her a whore, and Tucker got in her face, and they threw the guy out.
[03:01:55.623 --> 03:02:01.726]  There were witnesses, and then Avenatti's gonna sue Tucker, and everything else.
[03:02:02.367 --> 03:02:07.929]  And then a few days later, he's arrested for beating the hell out of his ex-wife, and reportedly a lot of witnesses to it, and all the rest of it.
[03:02:07.949 --> 03:02:11.751]  But the point is, is that, this is what these people do.
[03:02:12.211 --> 03:02:17.194]  You know, I told a story about, we're coming back from Colorado, this year, it was like back in March.
[03:02:19.795 --> 03:02:21.816]  My daughter's particularly liked Snowski.
[03:02:23.106 --> 03:02:31.309]  And we're coming back and these, I don't know, they were gay guys, big guys, but in the international snowboarding competitions, you could see their snowboards and everything.
[03:02:31.809 --> 03:02:33.490]  Big guys, you know, about as big as I am.
[03:02:33.510 --> 03:02:37.131]  They're both about 200 and something pounds, six feet tall.
[03:02:39.172 --> 03:02:41.973]  And they come by and say, F you and stuff, you know, me in the seat.
[03:02:42.033 --> 03:02:44.234]  And when I get out, I'm getting our baggage hours later.
[03:02:46.718 --> 03:02:48.019]  They come over and talk smack to me.
[03:02:48.039 --> 03:02:48.759]  I just ignore it.
[03:02:48.819 --> 03:02:51.060]  And then they see my son just being nice, getting his bags.
[03:02:51.100 --> 03:02:52.820]  He wants to go away from this going on.
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:56.842]  Gets his bags and goes out and is going to wait for me while I'm waiting for the other bags.
[03:02:57.242 --> 03:02:59.483]  And my wife's there and my four children.
[03:03:01.664 --> 03:03:06.606]  And they walk over and they go, and I see this happening.
[03:03:06.626 --> 03:03:07.306]  They go, you want to fight?
[03:03:07.766 --> 03:03:11.507]  Let's throw down to a guy that wasn't even 16 years old yet.
[03:03:11.527 --> 03:03:13.688]  He looked like he was about 18.
[03:03:13.828 --> 03:03:15.129]  They tried to fight my son.
[03:03:16.323 --> 03:03:17.484]  That's the thing about the left, man.
[03:03:17.864 --> 03:03:20.565]  Whatever a villain does, they do it.
[03:03:20.585 --> 03:03:30.470]  Whatever you read about in comic books or movies, that's... I used to see that when I was a kid, and I projected my basic chivalry on to everybody else must be like me.
[03:03:31.271 --> 03:03:32.091]  Kind of a romantic.
[03:03:33.952 --> 03:03:34.592]  And that's not true.
[03:03:36.733 --> 03:03:39.995]  These people are villains, and they hate you.
[03:03:40.095 --> 03:03:41.296]  And it wasn't because they were, quote, gay.
[03:03:42.526 --> 03:03:48.071]  It was that they wanted to project on me I'm a bad guy, and I was just ignoring them and not even really laughing at them.
[03:03:48.111 --> 03:03:49.172]  I'm thinking, okay, man, yeah, whatever.
[03:03:49.512 --> 03:03:50.013]  I didn't care.
[03:03:50.033 --> 03:03:55.698]  I wanted to get the bags and get them in the car and go home and, you know, get in the hot tub or go read the news.
[03:03:56.618 --> 03:04:00.282]  And when they couldn't get me to go after them, they went after my son.
[03:04:03.084 --> 03:04:04.485]  And they wore it like royals.
[03:04:04.525 --> 03:04:06.067]  They're like, we're gay.
[03:04:06.707 --> 03:04:09.310]  Look at your family, your pathetic family.
[03:04:10.316 --> 03:04:12.778]  Because when the first they walked by, they're like, F you, by the way, where's your family?
[03:04:12.798 --> 03:04:13.618]  And I'm like, all right, here.
[03:04:13.858 --> 03:04:18.402]  And they saw my good-looking wife, my four kids, that big national story that I don't have any family.
[03:04:18.942 --> 03:04:28.449]  And they were just... And then they saw my son, handsome, strong, and it was just like, a spirit of the left is, kill the children, ruin their future, suck their souls.
[03:04:29.169 --> 03:04:31.250]  The left are a cult of vampires.
[03:04:31.711 --> 03:04:32.731]  Most of them don't even know it.
[03:04:33.072 --> 03:04:34.813]  They're psychic vampires.
[03:04:35.553 --> 03:04:36.094]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:45.479 --> 03:04:50.742]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[03:04:51.763 --> 03:04:58.627]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:04:58.887 --> 03:05:01.329]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:05:01.989 --> 03:05:02.850]  I want to keep going.
[03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:07.212]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:05:07.272 --> 03:05:09.234]  I want to push all the way.
[03:05:10.194 --> 03:05:11.135]  I've committed to do that.
[03:05:11.295 --> 03:05:12.076]  I've prayed for that.
[03:05:12.656 --> 03:05:14.258]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:05:14.298 --> 03:05:17.280]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:05:18.161 --> 03:05:20.623]  I will give the total sacrifice.
[03:05:21.204 --> 03:05:22.305]  I will never falter.
[03:05:22.325 --> 03:05:24.927]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:05:25.227 --> 03:05:25.928]  I physically will.
[03:05:26.368 --> 03:05:33.134]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, thenfulmorestore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:05:48.746 --> 03:05:50.328]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:05:50.669 --> 03:05:56.356]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Doug Eggman.
[03:06:03.024 --> 03:06:03.745]  Doug Hagman.
[03:06:03.985 --> 03:06:06.727]  Doug Hagman for sitting in for Alex.
[03:06:06.947 --> 03:06:08.088]  Infowars.com.
[03:06:08.108 --> 03:06:09.609]  I want to welcome you to the fourth hour.
[03:06:10.110 --> 03:06:16.075]  Thanks for joining us with me because of, well, because of weather conditions, because of joint investigations.
[03:06:16.095 --> 03:06:16.675]  This is Joe.
[03:06:16.775 --> 03:06:17.836]  He's also in the studio.
[03:06:18.316 --> 03:06:19.177]  I'm in my office.
[03:06:20.158 --> 03:06:23.941]  Going to be talking about a number of different issues during this hour.
[03:06:24.161 --> 03:06:28.605]  Of course, we've got the normal news, as we know it, the caravan.
[03:06:29.665 --> 03:06:31.666]  Which is really not a caravan, it's an invasion.
[03:06:32.106 --> 03:06:33.147]  Who's behind that?
[03:06:33.727 --> 03:06:35.468]  Follow the money, follow the groups.
[03:06:35.548 --> 03:06:39.169]  I know that Alex and InfoWars has been covering this, so have we.
[03:06:39.930 --> 03:06:47.973]  Great, by the way, great video from Ali today, or yesterday I believe it was, on the War Room.
[03:06:48.753 --> 03:06:50.634]  Also on InfoWars.com.
[03:06:50.854 --> 03:06:54.176]  Superb video, reporting from the ground.
[03:06:55.236 --> 03:07:08.769]  We're going to be addressing, of course, the open border activists, the open border billionaire radicals who are behind or who are funding and preparing or providing logistical support for this alien invasion.
[03:07:09.509 --> 03:07:10.550]  And where are they based?
[03:07:10.590 --> 03:07:12.212]  They're based, of course, in Chicago.
[03:07:12.805 --> 03:07:13.566]  Who's behind it?
[03:07:13.706 --> 03:07:31.722]  A number of groups, open border groups, a number of billionaire radicals, and of course most if not all of them associated with either Barack Hussein Obama or Hillary Rodham Clinton or both the different foundations as well as the shadow government operated by Barack Hussein Obama.
[03:07:32.322 --> 03:07:36.063]  Also, the Whitaker appointment, I want to touch on that a little bit.
[03:07:36.663 --> 03:07:50.545]  The Whitaker appointment to replace Jeff Sessions for a 210-day period, according to law, and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, and how that plays into the entire operation here.
[03:07:50.765 --> 03:08:00.647]  How this allows for President Trump, of course, to make this appointment, how it is constitutional, despite some people on Fox News.
[03:08:01.567 --> 03:08:15.234]  And other dissenting legal opinions well when you look at it when you look when you dig deep into case history the Supreme Court rulings Subsequent to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 which is 5 U.S.C.
[03:08:15.274 --> 03:08:23.818]  section 3345 Subsection or paragraph a subsection 3 if you really want to get technical you can see that that the
[03:08:25.748 --> 03:08:32.410]  Federal Vacancies Act was used by previous administrations.
[03:08:32.770 --> 03:08:37.291]  Of course, some had complained that it was an end run around the Constitution.
[03:08:37.771 --> 03:08:42.372]  In fact, there was some court cases, a few court cases that addressed this.
[03:08:42.952 --> 03:08:50.454]  And of course, the new, and I should point this out, under Donald J. Trump as president,
[03:08:51.094 --> 03:08:56.779]  The line of succession at the Department of Justice would be, of course, number one, the Attorney General.
[03:08:56.819 --> 03:08:58.520]  Number two, the Deputy Attorney General.
[03:08:58.580 --> 03:09:00.202]  Thirdly, the Associate AG.
[03:09:01.182 --> 03:09:03.604]  And, of course, four, five, and six are rather interesting.
[03:09:03.684 --> 03:09:06.246]  Four is the U.S.
[03:09:06.306 --> 03:09:08.989]  Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.
[03:09:09.789 --> 03:09:10.770]  Number five would be the U.S.
[03:09:10.830 --> 03:09:12.952]  Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina.
[03:09:13.032 --> 03:09:14.133]  And six would be the U.S.
[03:09:14.193 --> 03:09:17.355]  Attorney for the Northern District of Texas.
[03:09:19.072 --> 03:09:19.772]  Think of it this way.
[03:09:20.132 --> 03:09:30.916]  If something happened to the existing AG, in this case Sessions, resigned, the line of succession as delineated by President Donald J. Trump was just as I provided.
[03:09:31.396 --> 03:09:37.578]  Again, the Attorney General, number one, Deputy AG, number two, third, Associate Attorney General, four, U.S.
[03:09:37.638 --> 03:09:43.300]  Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, five, just going over this again, the Eastern District of North Carolina, and six,
[03:09:44.701 --> 03:09:45.942]  The Northern District of Texas.
[03:09:45.982 --> 03:09:47.323]  Now you might think, well that's pretty boring.
[03:09:47.584 --> 03:09:49.225]  Why would I even care about this?
[03:09:49.285 --> 03:09:55.851]  I mean, my goodness, I barely learned about presidential succession in high school, so why would I really care about this?
[03:09:56.672 --> 03:10:10.264]  Well, when you look at, when you examine what President Trump is doing in fighting the deep state, you can see, even though he provided this particular line of succession during his tenure as president,
[03:10:11.189 --> 03:10:20.563]  He himself is considering, at least this is my personal assessment, professional assessment, and the assessment of others I've spoken to inside the Beltway.
[03:10:21.144 --> 03:10:25.330]  He's looking at the status of the Office of the Department of Justice.
[03:10:27.751 --> 03:10:32.833]  And saying, look, we have a real problem here, especially with Rod Rosenstein as the WDAG.
[03:10:33.433 --> 03:10:35.034]  So we have number one and number two out.
[03:10:35.154 --> 03:10:38.816]  Number two, of course, Rod Rosenstein, the WDAG.
[03:10:39.016 --> 03:10:40.196]  What do we do about this?
[03:10:40.376 --> 03:10:42.677]  Do we go to number three, four, five, or six?
[03:10:43.377 --> 03:10:43.578]  No.
[03:10:43.738 --> 03:10:51.301]  What we do is we tap an appropriate substitute for the Attorney General position.
[03:10:51.421 --> 03:10:53.121]  And I'm not sure how many people have heard this before.
[03:10:53.141 --> 03:10:54.262]  I know Alex has talked about this.
[03:10:55.436 --> 03:11:05.685]  So we tap Whitaker, who is well-versed in the issues at hand, not necessarily required for recusal, and put him in that position.
[03:11:06.026 --> 03:11:12.672]  And suddenly Rosenstein becomes subservient to the previous chief of staff, if you will.
[03:11:12.832 --> 03:11:14.313]  So it's a rather interesting dynamic.
[03:11:14.373 --> 03:11:16.435]  I think it's a brilliant play by President Donald Trump.
[03:11:16.455 --> 03:11:20.539]  And of course, the left, their heads are exploding, the progressive left, because
[03:11:22.598 --> 03:11:27.260]  It is constitutional, at least based on the legal aspect of the law.
[03:11:28.460 --> 03:11:31.862]  As I mentioned, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998.
[03:11:33.602 --> 03:11:48.668]  But it also is neutering or neutralizing, I prefer neutering, of Rod Rosenstein, who himself may find himself to be in a position of, well, maybe perhaps the next recipient
[03:11:49.509 --> 03:11:58.873]  Of a criminal referral, whether it be through, well, it could very well be through an independent audit or independent overview.
[03:11:58.993 --> 03:12:00.714]  Now, this is just, of course, I'm not a lawyer.
[03:12:00.734 --> 03:12:01.394]  I'm not an attorney.
[03:12:02.015 --> 03:12:04.876]  In full disclosure, I'm an investigator by profession.
[03:12:04.916 --> 03:12:18.102]  So I'm looking at this, but speaking with attorneys and speaking with constitutional experts and saying, essentially here, to trust in President Trump's, not just advice that he's getting,
[03:12:18.766 --> 03:12:19.807]  But his tactics.
[03:12:20.187 --> 03:12:25.050]  I do believe that we're looking at a very positive thing here as we go forward.
[03:12:25.711 --> 03:12:31.995]  And it's interesting to me that you've got people such as Judge Napolitano and others
[03:12:32.990 --> 03:12:36.431]  Who are saying, well, this is marginally inappropriate.
[03:12:37.912 --> 03:12:50.496]  In fact, some cases were cited that allegedly supersede the Federal Vacancy Reform Act, including the NLRB case of 2017.
[03:12:51.056 --> 03:12:53.437]  And again, I reference that end around the Constitution.
[03:12:54.157 --> 03:13:20.435]  But in this case some of the qualifiers for Whitaker are a tad different than we've seen in the past So here's the bottom line on that and here's where I just want to finish this off In looking at this this to me again is a brilliant tactic as long as Whitaker does not in any way shape or form fall victim to the political pressure of the
[03:13:22.033 --> 03:13:26.076]  Well, the forcible recusal, the obligatory recusal.
[03:13:26.856 --> 03:13:27.837]  And why would that be?
[03:13:28.037 --> 03:13:33.480]  Well, at one time he was in contact with and had a professional association with Sam Clovis.
[03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:43.346]  And Sam Clovis is at the epicenter of, or I shouldn't say at the epicenter, but within the periphery, within the orbit of what is known as Russiagate.
[03:13:45.385 --> 03:13:48.128]  The bottom line here, that's just a red herring.
[03:13:48.168 --> 03:13:51.311]  That's just something that is tossed into confuse and muddle.
[03:13:51.952 --> 03:13:54.054]  So again, I'm Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex.
[03:13:54.174 --> 03:13:56.336]  Infowars.com is the website.
[03:13:56.356 --> 03:13:57.658]  By the way, folks, if you haven't done so,
[03:13:58.718 --> 03:14:06.385]  You know, you know that all of us, myself and Joe together, we are the Hagman Report, HagmanReport.com.
[03:14:06.405 --> 03:14:12.870]  You know that we are under extreme oppression, censorship, oppression by private entities.
[03:14:13.351 --> 03:14:15.713]  So here's what you need to do, in my view.
[03:14:15.733 --> 03:14:24.200]  You need to support, if you're listening to this show, I don't care wherever you're at, if you're listening to this show, that means you're interested.
[03:14:25.186 --> 03:14:28.090]  That means you want the information, so here's what you need to do.
[03:14:28.150 --> 03:14:30.553]  You need to support this broadcast.
[03:14:30.573 --> 03:14:32.155]  You need to support InfoWars.com.
[03:14:32.175 --> 03:14:38.644]  You do so in a number of different ways, either by directly contributing to the cause or go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:14:40.131 --> 03:14:43.012]  Just have an entire litany of products.
[03:14:43.352 --> 03:14:44.713]  Great products, by the way, Bill.
[03:14:45.313 --> 03:14:45.993]  Vitality.
[03:14:46.193 --> 03:14:49.474]  Some of the best nutritional supplements I've ever taken.
[03:14:49.914 --> 03:14:50.995]  I could tell a difference.
[03:14:51.595 --> 03:14:53.316]  Mental clarity, physical stamina.
[03:14:53.376 --> 03:14:53.936]  I mean, look at me.
[03:14:54.176 --> 03:14:55.076]  Oops, sorry about that.
[03:14:55.096 --> 03:14:55.456]  Look at me.
[03:14:56.117 --> 03:15:00.978]  Just the picture of vitality.
[03:15:02.599 --> 03:15:05.020]  But seriously, they make a difference.
[03:15:05.220 --> 03:15:07.741]  So folks, again, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:15:07.801 --> 03:15:08.841]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:15:09.637 --> 03:15:11.158]  Doug Hagman again, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:15:11.198 --> 03:15:11.698]  Getting right back.
[03:15:15.319 --> 03:15:21.141]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:15:21.861 --> 03:15:23.401]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:15:37.947 --> 03:15:42.214]  There's only four days left at InfoWarsTore.com on one of the biggest sales we've ever had.
[03:15:42.234 --> 03:15:46.822]  67% off blowout sale and free shipping storewide.
[03:15:54.378 --> 03:15:58.963]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[03:15:58.983 --> 03:16:16.179]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[03:16:16.640 --> 03:16:17.300]  But is it true?
[03:16:18.201 --> 03:16:24.686]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[03:16:25.687 --> 03:16:29.309]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[03:16:30.210 --> 03:16:31.551]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[03:16:32.503 --> 03:16:38.910]  So the establishment wants us off the air because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming.
[03:16:38.930 --> 03:16:41.232]  Live every day from 11 a.m.
[03:16:41.252 --> 03:16:41.513]  to 3 p.m.
[03:16:41.553 --> 03:16:42.414]  just on my show.
[03:16:42.554 --> 03:16:45.177]  Then you got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[03:16:45.217 --> 03:16:45.537]  Central.
[03:16:45.998 --> 03:16:49.421]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:16:49.441 --> 03:16:50.062]  in the War Room.
[03:16:50.302 --> 03:16:52.264]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[03:16:52.284 --> 03:16:53.466]  They're trying to block that.
[03:16:54.383 --> 03:16:58.166]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[03:16:58.826 --> 03:17:05.971]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[03:17:06.471 --> 03:17:08.993]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[03:17:09.793 --> 03:17:13.796]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers, not let us advertise a lot.
[03:17:14.417 --> 03:17:18.040]  Kick us off PayPal, kick us off Facebook, kick us off Twitter, kick us off YouTube.
[03:17:18.100 --> 03:17:24.726]  And over a hundred other platforms now, where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[03:17:25.286 --> 03:17:26.107]  They're doing audits.
[03:17:26.587 --> 03:17:33.289]  Throughout the system, finding by contacting companies who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:35.389]  That's because we are on target.
[03:17:35.449 --> 03:17:37.590]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[03:17:37.630 --> 03:17:39.530]  We're exposing their main operation.
[03:17:39.990 --> 03:17:41.631]  And look, I know you guys know that.
[03:17:42.071 --> 03:17:42.931]  That's why you've supported us.
[03:17:42.971 --> 03:17:49.033]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:17:50.293 --> 03:17:52.235]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[03:17:52.255 --> 03:18:02.523]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[03:18:02.883 --> 03:18:03.924]  To hand-share those links.
[03:18:03.984 --> 03:18:05.585]  To text message people.
[03:18:05.925 --> 03:18:08.006]  Information you think is particularly important.
[03:18:08.026 --> 03:18:09.387]  To get around the censors.
[03:18:09.407 --> 03:18:10.748]  Nothing can stop the word of mouth.
[03:18:11.248 --> 03:18:14.750]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[03:18:15.030 --> 03:18:17.651]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[03:18:17.912 --> 03:18:24.135]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[03:18:26.431 --> 03:18:29.795]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[03:18:30.275 --> 03:18:31.977]  They're all there at thefloorstore.com.
[03:18:32.017 --> 03:18:32.638]  Patriot apparel.
[03:18:33.278 --> 03:18:33.799]  It's all there.
[03:18:35.100 --> 03:18:42.628]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items.
[03:18:46.813 --> 03:19:00.308]  We already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[03:19:01.189 --> 03:19:04.130]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[03:19:04.530 --> 03:19:08.931]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[03:19:08.971 --> 03:19:15.813]  So please take advantage of them today at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:16.213 --> 03:19:17.573]  Everybody loves Rainforest.
[03:19:17.593 --> 03:19:19.014]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[03:19:19.454 --> 03:19:19.774]  30% off.
[03:19:20.014 --> 03:19:21.614]  Everybody really loves our cohoil silver.
[03:19:21.834 --> 03:19:23.495]  Highest quality, 67% off, silver bullet.
[03:19:24.935 --> 03:19:30.639]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off in free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:31.179 --> 03:19:37.303]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these products a true 360 win.
[03:19:41.686 --> 03:19:44.308]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:00.962 --> 03:20:05.089]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:05.570 --> 03:20:09.697]  It's Alex Jones with Doug Agman.
[03:20:12.549 --> 03:20:17.453]  Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, my home base, HagmanReport.com.
[03:20:17.513 --> 03:20:20.196]  That's Hagman2N, it's HagmanReport.com.
[03:20:20.216 --> 03:20:25.921]  So glad to be with you to give you a number of, well, we're working on a number of different investigative issues.
[03:20:26.601 --> 03:20:29.464]  This segment, I'd like to bring on my son Joe.
[03:20:29.724 --> 03:20:31.506]  Together we work investigations.
[03:20:32.727 --> 03:20:37.171]  We are, of course, if you don't know us, if this is the first time seeing us on InfoWars,
[03:20:38.091 --> 03:20:48.021]  We are licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and other states as investigators, private investigators working for Fortune 100 companies, and of course, multi-state licensed at that.
[03:20:48.141 --> 03:20:55.788]  Been doing this for 30-some years, Joe, for about, well, about a decade, so that gives you some indication of my age.
[03:20:56.949 --> 03:21:01.133]  Some issues that we're going to be talking about this segment include
[03:21:01.913 --> 03:21:11.383]  The federal court has mandated that Clinton Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton must answer additional questions about her emails.
[03:21:11.403 --> 03:21:13.966]  I think this is pretty interesting and pretty
[03:21:15.857 --> 03:21:16.757]  Well-timed.
[03:21:16.817 --> 03:21:18.758]  Of course, Judicial Watch is behind this.
[03:21:19.379 --> 03:21:26.642]  A federal court is compelling, of course, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to respond to further questions under oath about her emails.
[03:21:27.222 --> 03:21:43.289]  And that includes, this would include, there are two separate issues, but this also includes her communications, or should include her communications, with Barry Sotoro, Barack Hussein Obama, whilst she was on foreign hostile soil, that being Russia.
[03:21:44.049 --> 03:21:44.450]  Yes, sir.
[03:21:58.826 --> 03:22:00.807]  Tom Fenton, of course, is doing a great job.
[03:22:00.927 --> 03:22:02.127]  JudicialWatch.com.
[03:22:02.688 --> 03:22:11.251]  Two questions that need to be answered, and you can find this, of course, at Judicial Watch, but two questions that need to be answered concerning her email activity.
[03:22:11.291 --> 03:22:13.152]  Number one is, who set up the email account?
[03:22:13.172 --> 03:22:14.333]  Who set up the server?
[03:22:14.733 --> 03:22:15.733]  Who set up the infrastructure?
[03:22:16.433 --> 03:22:27.078]  And, of course, some additional, the second question would be a little bit more detailed into the actual topic of conversations.
[03:22:27.777 --> 03:22:29.297]  Now we've got Jim Acosta.
[03:22:29.598 --> 03:22:30.618]  Joe's been working on this.
[03:22:31.298 --> 03:22:38.480]  He's got contacts within DC, inside the Beltway, talking to individuals about Jim Acosta, his behavior, CNN.
[03:22:39.801 --> 03:22:42.121]  Joe, what have you found out about this?
[03:22:42.241 --> 03:22:44.422]  Because I know you've been working on this pretty intently.
[03:22:45.243 --> 03:22:46.944]  First, I want to correct you on the introduction.
[03:22:46.984 --> 03:22:49.686]  You said, Joe, you know, you've been doing this for about a decade.
[03:22:49.966 --> 03:22:53.508]  But when we started doing the show, that's the same figure you used.
[03:22:53.588 --> 03:22:55.910]  And we've been doing the show for almost nine years now.
[03:22:55.970 --> 03:22:58.831]  So we're looking at two decades of doing this.
[03:22:58.891 --> 03:23:01.033]  But no, seriously, with the cost.
[03:23:02.294 --> 03:23:04.577]  On the front of Drudge today, you see the headline.
[03:23:05.378 --> 03:23:08.642]  President Trump says he has the authority to ban all journalists.
[03:23:08.662 --> 03:23:11.927]  Trump seeks to land blow against media in court fight with CNN.
[03:23:11.967 --> 03:23:19.697]  We just learned that a judge has postponed the ruling that was to be issued today at 3 o'clock, whether to restore Jim Acosta's press pass.
[03:23:20.197 --> 03:23:23.401]  And this has been postponed until tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.
[03:23:23.761 --> 03:23:32.090]  Judge Timothy Kelly heard two hours of oral arguments about CNN's request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on Wednesday.
[03:23:32.510 --> 03:23:34.472]  He said the court would reconceive Thursday at 3 p.m.
[03:23:35.413 --> 03:23:38.034]  And then rescheduled it for Friday at 10 a.m.
[03:23:38.374 --> 03:23:42.076]  Now what's interesting about this, Judge Timothy Kelly is a Trump appointee.
[03:23:42.116 --> 03:23:53.881]  He was appointed in 2017 and this is, I believe, one of the first cases of this kind, especially this important, to be heard by a federal judge that has been appointed by Trump.
[03:23:54.361 --> 03:24:00.105]  Now, what Acosta has done really has made himself part of the story and he's done this all the time.
[03:24:00.565 --> 03:24:11.432]  Even Acosta's reporter peers think that he has gone too far and always has making himself part of the story rather than doing his job and reporting the news.
[03:24:11.812 --> 03:24:14.394]  But it's not just the president, it's not just the White House, it's not
[03:24:14.454 --> 03:24:14.774]  I don't
[03:24:30.247 --> 03:24:30.347]  Yeah.
[03:24:45.706 --> 03:24:49.689]  That CNN is arguing from, but I'm really interested to see the ruling.
[03:24:50.249 --> 03:25:01.576]  And again, because of this judge, Timothy Kelly, who is a Trump appointee, but as CNN reports it, this is, you know, a war, a war on the truth, a war on them.
[03:25:01.856 --> 03:25:11.582]  And even though there's 50 other credentialed reporters in CNN who could fill in for and take the job Acosta was doing, they want to drag this fight out.
[03:25:11.642 --> 03:25:13.203]  And this is part of the Soros plan.
[03:25:13.263 --> 03:25:13.924]  The media matters.
[03:25:14.424 --> 03:25:14.624]  I think?
[03:25:33.968 --> 03:25:41.697]  So this is the standard operating procedure of the left lawfare, as we call it, as we see and know too well personally how that works.
[03:25:42.117 --> 03:25:48.504]  But that's something that I'm looking at here that I think is very important and has issued its
[03:25:49.125 --> 03:25:49.746]  It's going to last.
[03:25:49.966 --> 03:25:53.909]  This decision is going to have ramifications well beyond Acosta and CNN.
[03:25:54.289 --> 03:26:02.616]  Then the other piece of news I'm looking at here, we were talking about Matthew Whitaker, the Department of Justice Attorney General.
[03:26:02.856 --> 03:26:14.145]  The Department of Justice saying that yes, he does have the authority to rule and oversee the Mueller investigation at his time as interim Attorney General until there is a new appointee there.
[03:26:14.605 --> 03:26:22.152]  And there is a piece on USA Today, Matthew Whitaker isn't acting like just a caretaker as interim Attorney General.
[03:26:22.512 --> 03:26:24.374]  They want to look like Jeff Sessions type.
[03:26:25.629 --> 03:26:25.809]  Right.
[03:26:26.210 --> 03:26:27.010]  He's not a bookmark.
[03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:27.771]  He's not a bookend.
[03:26:27.811 --> 03:26:29.432]  He's not a doorstop.
[03:26:30.253 --> 03:26:33.075]  He does have the full power and authority of that office.
[03:26:33.535 --> 03:26:37.398]  Is that correct, based on your findings and your research?
[03:26:37.558 --> 03:26:42.922]  Not only is that correct, but he's using that authority as though he was the acting Attorney General.
[03:26:43.342 --> 03:26:53.830]  And that has a lot of people in Washington, a lot of Democrats, and even some Republicans are questioning his ability and assertions in his interim post.
[03:26:54.310 --> 03:27:00.675]  But he does have the full authority and the DOJ even backed that up to the dismay of some of the Democrats.
[03:27:00.775 --> 03:27:07.399]  But they say he poses a clear and present danger to the ongoing Russia investigation, which is nothing more than a witch hunt.
[03:27:07.740 --> 03:27:11.722]  And our friend Jerome Corsi has now been caught up in the crosshairs.
[03:27:12.203 --> 03:27:16.546]  And it's really, I get really angry thinking about what they're doing to this man.
[03:27:17.286 --> 03:27:21.370]  And, you know, this needs to stop with this Russia investigation.
[03:27:21.630 --> 03:27:28.876]  But Whitaker has, Lindsey Graham has said he's been assured that Whitaker would not end the Mueller probe.
[03:27:28.996 --> 03:27:30.517]  But there are other ways he can affect it.
[03:27:30.617 --> 03:27:37.683]  As he has said in his own words in a CNN interview, he can take the operating budget to such a low level that they would not be able to do anything.
[03:27:38.364 --> 03:27:41.006]  So there are ways around that without actually firing him.
[03:27:42.335 --> 03:27:51.244]  And there's two separate issues that you mentioned here, I think, worth noting here in the remaining 50 or so seconds we have of this segment.
[03:27:51.945 --> 03:28:02.496]  First of all, the Acosta, and what you mentioned about Acosta with respect to the standing of other potential journalists.
[03:28:04.148 --> 03:28:05.670]  It's not a right, it's a privilege.
[03:28:05.690 --> 03:28:11.035]  And of course, that whole process of peer review to get into the press pool and the approval therein.
[03:28:11.055 --> 03:28:15.680]  So we're going to be following that closely, the ACOSTA issue closely.
[03:28:15.720 --> 03:28:21.546]  But the second part of this, your reference to Whitaker, of course, that I've been working on as well.
[03:28:23.743 --> 03:28:30.717]  Well, let's hit more of this on the other side of the break because I think it's important from a law fair point of view and from a tactical point of view.
[03:28:30.777 --> 03:28:31.940]  Folks, you're listening to InfoWars.
[03:28:31.980 --> 03:28:33.002]  Doug Hagman, Joe Hagman.
[03:28:33.042 --> 03:28:33.643]  We'll be right back.

[03:29:38.160 --> 03:29:41.604]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:29:41.624 --> 03:29:44.888]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:29:45.409 --> 03:29:51.195]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:29:51.676 --> 03:29:54.459]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:29:55.180 --> 03:29:58.625]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:29:59.005 --> 03:30:05.074]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:30:05.474 --> 03:30:10.441]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:30:11.198 --> 03:30:14.603]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:30:15.124 --> 03:30:21.653]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:30:22.314 --> 03:30:26.941]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:30:27.521 --> 03:30:32.664]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:30:33.224 --> 03:30:37.206]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:30:37.746 --> 03:30:41.548]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:30:41.889 --> 03:30:48.512]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[03:32:17.066 --> 03:32:18.827]  Apple banned your app.
[03:32:19.127 --> 03:32:22.989]  I helped, too!
[03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:24.270]  Oh, Oliver.

[03:33:10.410 --> 03:33:10.750]  All right.
[03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:12.011]  Talk about false starts.
[03:33:12.091 --> 03:33:15.353]  Doug Hagman, InfoWars.com, my home base.
[03:33:15.533 --> 03:33:17.093]  HagmanReport.com.
[03:33:17.133 --> 03:33:18.334]  I almost forgot where I was at.
[03:33:18.934 --> 03:33:21.516]  Had a little bit of a premature situation here.
[03:33:21.576 --> 03:33:22.196]  Don't start.
[03:33:22.856 --> 03:33:24.317]  HagmanReport Live as well.
[03:33:25.262 --> 03:33:26.082]  The Hagman Report Live!
[03:33:26.122 --> 03:33:27.783]  Thank you very much Doug and Joe Hagman.
[03:33:27.803 --> 03:33:28.323]  A couple of things.
[03:33:29.983 --> 03:33:36.164]  This segment, we do want to get into our findings and our conversations with people on the ground in Florida, what's really going on.
[03:33:36.825 --> 03:33:39.705]  And this is something that Dan Bongino talked about.
[03:33:40.245 --> 03:33:43.066]  But you need to know something about what's going on in Florida.
[03:33:43.526 --> 03:33:44.786]  I know Alex has referenced this.
[03:33:44.866 --> 03:33:48.707]  I know that other platforms have as well.
[03:33:48.747 --> 03:33:52.788]  But before we get into that, a little bit of unfinished business.
[03:33:54.180 --> 03:34:02.847]  A couple of segments, two segments ago, spoke about Hillary Clinton and being compelled by Judge Emmett Sullivan to answer under oath two questions.
[03:34:02.888 --> 03:34:21.643]  Of course, the first question, and this, thanks to Judicial Watch, the first question being, describe the creation of the clintonemail.com system, including who decided to create the system, the date it was decided to create the system, why it was created, who set it up, and when it became operational.
[03:34:22.694 --> 03:34:30.280]  I kind of glanced over or glossed over the second part of that, or the second question, and that is, during your October 22, 2015 appearance before the U.S.
[03:34:30.300 --> 03:34:40.628]  House of Representatives Select Committee on Benghazi, you testified that 90 to 95 percent of your emails were in the state's system, which, by the way, was a lie, just a blatant lie.
[03:34:41.949 --> 03:34:44.871]  And if they wanted to see them, they certainly could have been able to do so.
[03:34:45.632 --> 03:34:47.553]  Identify the basis for this statement.
[03:34:48.473 --> 03:34:55.155]  I love this question because there's no way that she could wiggle out of this particular question without calling.
[03:34:55.175 --> 03:35:00.257]  I mean, she either lied on October 22, 2015, or she's going to be lying this time.
[03:35:00.937 --> 03:35:04.739]  And I have a feeling that we're going to see some pretty interesting sparks fly.
[03:35:05.339 --> 03:35:07.660]  So that's the Judicial Watch initiative.
[03:35:08.060 --> 03:35:09.220]  And thank you, Tom Fenton.
[03:35:09.260 --> 03:35:10.040]  Thank you, Chris Farrell.
[03:35:10.060 --> 03:35:11.401]  Thank you, Judicial Watch, for doing that.
[03:35:12.419 --> 03:35:22.464]  Uh, before getting to Florida as well, uh, we talked about Acosta and we talked about the press conferences, uh, specifically the infamous Acosta press conference.
[03:35:23.145 --> 03:35:31.529]  But how many people, I mean, people must have short memories because folks do you remember back in 09, I believe it was, uh, Major Garrett
[03:35:32.404 --> 03:35:35.985]  He asked one question to Obama about Iranian hostages.
[03:35:36.825 --> 03:35:41.267]  And he was just, he got schooled and basically told to shut up.
[03:35:41.387 --> 03:35:47.388]  I mean, he was persona non grata within the press pool under Obama.
[03:35:48.268 --> 03:35:54.210]  And don't forget as well, Obama's treatment of the Fox News.
[03:35:54.790 --> 03:36:00.852]  Remember, Obama believed Fox News to be the enemy of Obama.
[03:36:01.906 --> 03:36:04.907]  To the extent, the numbers don't lie.
[03:36:04.927 --> 03:36:11.929]  During his first 36 press conferences, no one from Fox was called on for 22 of the 36 press conferences.
[03:36:12.969 --> 03:36:20.452]  So what I'm saying is there were only 14 questions permitted during the course of 36 press conferences, Obama's first 36.
[03:36:28.634 --> 03:36:34.218]  So, when we're talking about fair and balanced, whether it's Fox or any other network, of course, the numbers don't lie.
[03:36:34.238 --> 03:36:34.698]  There it is.
[03:36:35.219 --> 03:36:43.364]  And you can find this, of course, on the... when you dig deep into the statistics of the White House recordings or White House press briefings.
[03:36:44.105 --> 03:36:51.910]  And the last... well, moving on to the... oh, the last issue as well, mentioned about the alien invasion.
[03:36:52.931 --> 03:36:55.693]  A little teaser at the beginning of the hour.
[03:36:56.722 --> 03:37:20.837]  Pablo Asen from Terrace, of course, Alex Jones has talked about, and others, but there are two other overlapping groups, and you'll find that they're all based out of Chicago, all funded by Billionaire Radicals, and all funded, or all processed through Christian churches, or so-called Christian churches, like the Chicago Lutheran Church, as well as some other religious entities in Chicago.
[03:37:20.877 --> 03:37:25.340]  But don't forget, Chicago is the center for community organizing, and this is where
[03:37:26.381 --> 03:37:31.806]  If this were a battle, this would be the enemy headquarters, at least for this iteration of the invasion.
[03:37:31.946 --> 03:37:43.517]  And that's Chicago, Pueblos Sinfonterras, Central Sinfonterras, people without borders, and the bottom line is these people don't want any borders anywhere, and especially not in America.
[03:37:43.597 --> 03:37:49.102]  Meanwhile, they'll lock their houses and build walls around their own homes, but not allow anything else.
[03:37:49.962 --> 03:37:57.667]  The other major issue here, Laura Loomer, of course, on the ground in Florida.
[03:37:58.607 --> 03:38:01.689]  We interviewed her at length before.
[03:38:01.989 --> 03:38:04.191]  Joe, before we toss it to you, I just want to mention this.
[03:38:05.271 --> 03:38:11.195]  What people are not really understanding is how what we're seeing in Florida is somewhat of a diversion.
[03:38:11.775 --> 03:38:15.938]  Now, I'm not going to say it's a complete diversion with respect to the senatorial race and the gubernatorial race.
[03:38:17.549 --> 03:38:23.034]  Folks, the Agricultural Commissioner position is also in play.
[03:38:23.394 --> 03:38:25.516]  Now there is a very... Matt Caldwell.
[03:38:26.016 --> 03:38:26.937]  Matt Caldwell, right.
[03:38:27.677 --> 03:38:29.179]  A very pro-Second Amendment.
[03:38:29.919 --> 03:38:40.188]  And the reason this is important is because that position makes policy and also governs these concealed weapons, concealed carry permits for Florida.
[03:38:40.708 --> 03:38:41.569]  So while... Don't they issue them?
[03:38:42.698 --> 03:38:47.864]  They're issued through the AG Commissioner's Office, right, and that office also sets policy.
[03:38:48.785 --> 03:39:05.142]  So, I mean, indirectly issued, I mean, ultimately that's the core issuance, but in the policy setters, however, it's important because you might be focused on DeSantis or you might be focused on whatever, Scott.
[03:39:05.848 --> 03:39:10.010]  Look, focus as well on the AG race because that's where it's at.
[03:39:10.311 --> 03:39:11.671]  But you've got some information as well.
[03:39:11.952 --> 03:39:12.332]  So go ahead.
[03:39:12.352 --> 03:39:13.072]  Yeah.
[03:39:13.833 --> 03:39:16.114]  Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.
[03:39:16.738 --> 03:39:27.984]  Bondi has launched an investigation saying that she has confirmed she believes there is plenty of reasonable suspicion for criminal activity in the investigation she ordered of the election activity in Broward and Palm Beach County.
[03:39:28.405 --> 03:39:31.406]  Investigate and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.
[03:39:31.927 --> 03:39:36.829]  Bondi should make examples of anyone who did anything to mess with the election and now she plans on doing that.
[03:39:36.869 --> 03:39:40.471]  How can 80,000 votes magically appear when there were only 30,000 votes possible?
[03:39:41.912 --> 03:39:42.713]  That is the question.
[03:39:43.013 --> 03:39:48.515]  While Democrats are trying to steal the election from the Republicans, the Republican Party has been sitting on its hands, and they really have.
[03:39:49.016 --> 03:39:54.779]  But the Florida GOP candidate, Matt Caldwell, we were up 40,000 votes Tuesday night based on what was reported there.
[03:39:55.239 --> 03:39:58.561]  There was only 30,000 votes possible that could still come from Broward.
[03:39:59.441 --> 03:40:00.322]  We declared victory.
[03:40:00.462 --> 03:40:00.962]  Went to bed.
[03:40:01.283 --> 03:40:04.065]  Over the next four days, they found 80,000 ballots, as you said.
[03:40:04.345 --> 03:40:08.589]  And so interesting, it's all these ballots, they're always for the Democratic side.
[03:40:09.109 --> 03:40:17.256]  And the judge has ruled, we saw that there was a ruling from Palm Beach County that there was an extension on the recounts until the 20th of November.
[03:40:17.676 --> 03:40:19.878]  That has been switched.
[03:40:19.938 --> 03:40:23.741]  The judge denies machine recount extension as legal wrangling continues.
[03:40:23.781 --> 03:40:25.343]  That's from a USA Today article.
[03:40:25.763 --> 03:40:34.465]  But the judge denied to extend the deadline in Florida's nationally watched election recount, even though it's appeared unlikely that one of the state's largest counties met the 3 p.m.
[03:40:34.885 --> 03:40:36.326]  Eastern Standard Time deadline.
[03:40:36.366 --> 03:40:48.909]  So the way I understand it right now, we are looking at the deadline, and that should mean that the first tabulation holds, meaning that DeSantis and Scott will hold their seats, both the governor and the Senate.
[03:40:49.550 --> 03:40:52.154]  And we're going to certainly see legal fights ensue.
[03:40:52.614 --> 03:40:57.502]  And they're trying to steal the elections also in Georgia, Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp.
[03:40:57.903 --> 03:41:03.392]  But as you said, the one in with the, what's his name here?
[03:41:05.384 --> 03:41:07.125]  You're talking about Caldwell now?
[03:41:07.145 --> 03:41:08.686]  Yeah, Matt Caldwell.
[03:41:09.106 --> 03:41:11.407]  This is one, as you said, we should be very focused on.
[03:41:11.627 --> 03:41:17.389]  Caldwell explained the lawsuit to WLRN today and said the first step is to get basic answers.
[03:41:17.449 --> 03:41:23.972]  Any supervisor in the state is able to tell you what kind of votes they had cast, whether it's a vote by mail, early votes.
[03:41:24.812 --> 03:41:32.095]  Or election day votes and when those tagged into the system in order to prove that they were cast before 7 on Tuesday night.
[03:41:32.395 --> 03:41:35.476]  And the Broward County Supervisor has been unable to answer that question.
[03:41:35.977 --> 03:41:38.357]  On Wednesday we asked, Thursday we asked, Friday we asked.
[03:41:38.377 --> 03:41:39.678]  So ultimately we filed a lawsuit.
[03:41:40.336 --> 03:41:43.177]  Just to produce all the records to see what the situation is.
[03:41:43.477 --> 03:41:51.801]  So my take on this is I hope that this Pam Bondi is serious, launches a full investigation, very transparent, gets to the bottom.
[03:41:52.201 --> 03:41:54.762]  Personally, I would verify every single vote if I had to.
[03:41:55.123 --> 03:41:56.843]  And I would want to know where the fraud came from.
[03:41:57.243 --> 03:41:59.765]  And Brenda Snipes should be held criminally accountable.
[03:41:59.785 --> 03:42:02.906]  She should have never been in that seat after the multiple
[03:42:03.206 --> 03:42:03.666]  Watch this.
[03:42:03.686 --> 03:42:03.926]  Watch this.
[03:42:30.285 --> 03:42:30.746]  That's right.
[03:42:30.806 --> 03:42:33.349]  You're listening to InfoWars, InfoWars.com.
[03:42:33.709 --> 03:42:35.952]  Support InfoWars, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:42:35.972 --> 03:42:37.433]  We'll be right back for our final segment.
[03:42:37.453 --> 03:42:41.738]  There's only four days left at InfoWarsStore.com on one of the biggest sales we've ever had.
[03:42:41.758 --> 03:42:46.324]  67% off blowout sale and free shipping storewide.
[03:42:53.897 --> 03:42:58.658]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[03:42:58.678 --> 03:43:15.663]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[03:43:16.143 --> 03:43:16.803]  But is it true?
[03:43:17.723 --> 03:43:24.206]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[03:43:25.207 --> 03:43:28.609]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[03:43:28.629 --> 03:43:31.090]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[03:43:32.037 --> 03:43:40.220]  So the establishment wants us off the air because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming live every day from 11 a.m.
[03:43:40.580 --> 03:43:41.020]  to 3 p.m.
[03:43:41.060 --> 03:43:42.021]  just on my show.
[03:43:42.061 --> 03:43:44.682]  Then you got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[03:43:44.722 --> 03:43:45.042]  Central.
[03:43:45.482 --> 03:43:48.943]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:43:48.963 --> 03:43:49.564]  in the War Room.
[03:43:49.784 --> 03:43:51.804]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[03:43:52.245 --> 03:43:52.965]  They're trying to block that.
[03:43:53.888 --> 03:43:57.691]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[03:43:58.351 --> 03:44:05.436]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[03:44:05.996 --> 03:44:08.518]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[03:44:09.298 --> 03:44:13.320]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers and not let us advertise online.
[03:44:13.940 --> 03:44:14.941]  Kick us off PayPal.
[03:44:14.981 --> 03:44:15.861]  Kick us off Facebook.
[03:44:15.941 --> 03:44:16.721]  Kick us off Twitter.
[03:44:16.741 --> 03:44:17.562]  Kick us off YouTube.
[03:44:17.582 --> 03:44:24.205]  And over a hundred other platforms now where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[03:44:24.765 --> 03:44:32.829]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[03:44:32.869 --> 03:44:34.910]  That's because we are on target.
[03:44:34.970 --> 03:44:37.112]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[03:44:37.152 --> 03:44:39.033]  We're exposing their main operation.
[03:44:39.513 --> 03:44:41.154]  And look, I know you guys know that.
[03:44:41.594 --> 03:44:42.454]  That's why you've supported us.
[03:44:42.494 --> 03:44:48.578]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:44:49.818 --> 03:44:51.760]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[03:44:51.780 --> 03:45:05.010]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever, to hand-share those links, to text message people.
[03:45:05.450 --> 03:45:06.871]  Information you think is particularly important.
[03:45:07.551 --> 03:45:08.892]  To get around the censors.
[03:45:08.932 --> 03:45:10.293]  Nothing can stop your word of mouth.
[03:45:10.753 --> 03:45:14.315]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[03:45:14.555 --> 03:45:17.377]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[03:45:17.417 --> 03:45:23.620]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[03:45:26.147 --> 03:45:29.309]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[03:45:29.790 --> 03:45:31.511]  They're all there at thefullrestore.com.
[03:45:31.551 --> 03:45:32.151]  Patriot apparel.
[03:45:32.792 --> 03:45:33.312]  It's all there.
[03:45:34.613 --> 03:45:42.138]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items.
[03:45:45.760 --> 03:45:59.817]  And we already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[03:46:00.698 --> 03:46:03.641]  So, a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[03:46:04.041 --> 03:46:08.446]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[03:46:08.486 --> 03:46:15.332]  So, please take advantage of them today at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.

[03:46:41.699 --> 03:46:44.322]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:46:50.242 --> 03:46:54.046]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:46:54.106 --> 03:46:55.367]  And now, your host, Doug Hagman.
[03:47:08.795 --> 03:47:10.278]  Infowars.com.
[03:47:10.799 --> 03:47:15.987]  Folks, if there was ever a time in our nation's history to pay attention to the headlines, it's now.
[03:47:16.428 --> 03:47:20.175]  If there was ever a time to support those people bringing the truth, it's now.
[03:47:20.905 --> 03:47:31.191]  So folks, please do us a favor, meaning us in the independent media, fighting the Marxist media, and let's support us.

[03:47:55.108 --> 03:47:59.469]  It helps the cause, and as well, just support the operations.
[03:47:59.869 --> 03:48:02.849]  You're supporting all of us, of course, who are fighting the fight.
[03:48:03.410 --> 03:48:08.571]  Now, a couple of issues that we began speaking about, myself and Joe Hagman.
[03:48:09.891 --> 03:48:13.992]  Before we go any further into the southern border, I do want to mention one thing.
[03:48:14.682 --> 03:48:20.147]  This is something that I've been driving home really, really hard in the last couple of days.
[03:48:20.167 --> 03:48:27.854]  And I don't know, I have not heard this mentioned, at least not on this platform, if it has been, my apologies.
[03:48:28.775 --> 03:48:34.820]  But folks, it was 1946 in McMinn County, Tennessee, the Battle of Athens, 1946.
[03:48:36.961 --> 03:48:43.166]  Study that if you've never heard about that if you don't know what I'm talking about Of course, McMinn County, Tennessee.
[03:48:43.186 --> 03:48:46.969]  It was a Republican stronghold in Tennessee.
[03:48:47.089 --> 03:48:54.574]  It was the farmland it was It was Much like what we see in flyover country even today.
[03:48:55.435 --> 03:48:56.816]  It was a great documentary about it.
[03:48:57.116 --> 03:48:57.557]  You can watch
[03:48:58.967 --> 03:49:12.733]  Absolutely, but watch which historical documents you do seek out, because of course, Wikipedia, you know, the manual entries there, the manual edits there, not so much.
[03:49:14.153 --> 03:49:16.314]  Know history, but know the proper history.
[03:49:16.694 --> 03:49:25.758]  But the voter theft in McMinn County, Tennessee, explains why we've got a Second Amendment, explains, at least in my view,
[03:49:26.419 --> 03:49:39.681]  And does a great job in going through voter suppression, voter fraud, and what the residents, what the men, what the veterans who came back to a cluster you-know-what in McMinn County.
[03:49:40.450 --> 03:49:46.433]  It really lays out what, in my personal opinion, what we're facing today.
[03:49:47.073 --> 03:49:48.994]  So I just wanted to bring that forth.
[03:49:49.074 --> 03:49:49.574]  Go ahead, Joe.
[03:49:50.294 --> 03:49:53.196]  Up on the screen there, I see an American story.
[03:49:54.116 --> 03:49:57.677]  That's what I watched and how I learned about the Battle of Athens.
[03:49:58.238 --> 03:50:03.500]  And that's a great historical piece that everybody, as you said, should watch.
[03:50:03.980 --> 03:50:11.784]  To understand why we have our Second Amendment rights, what they are for, and why we need them in times like this where we see these elections being stolen.
[03:50:11.804 --> 03:50:23.510]  And I do want to get to the southern border, but before we do that, we were mentioning Acosta, we were mentioning CNN and the lawsuit that they have launched against the White House to get Jim Acosta's press pass reinstated.
[03:50:23.530 --> 03:50:27.632]  I want to, I'm not one to quote Fox News hosts too much.
[03:50:28.052 --> 03:50:44.240]  But Tucker Carlson has been doing a really good job and last night he made a great point about CNN and free speech issues and I just want to read a quote from what he said last night on his broadcast talking about the hypocritical nature of CNN fighting for First Amendment rights.
[03:50:44.280 --> 03:50:46.521]  He says this, take CNN for example.
[03:50:46.701 --> 03:50:55.005]  It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the internet on the grounds they did not like what Jones had to say.
[03:50:55.125 --> 03:50:55.585]  Ultimately
[03:50:55.925 --> 03:50:57.726]  CNN succeeded in doing that.
[03:50:58.007 --> 03:51:02.710]  The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones and his outlet InfoWars.
[03:51:03.030 --> 03:51:10.275]  You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that terrifying, that as a terrifying loss for free speech because it was exactly that.
[03:51:10.615 --> 03:51:12.776]  But CNN was not done trying to silence its critics.
[03:51:12.816 --> 03:51:17.960]  Last year the cable news network threatened the anonymous Reddit user for creating an anti-CNN meme.
[03:51:18.300 --> 03:51:22.803]  CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin his life if it ever criticized by him again.
[03:51:23.343 --> 03:51:27.764]  Now CNN is claiming to defend free speech only when it is their speech.
[03:51:28.445 --> 03:51:32.026]  And I thought that was really good for Tucker Carlson to point out because he's right.
[03:51:32.366 --> 03:51:35.907]  The only kind of speech that CNN is looking to protect is their speech.
[03:51:36.327 --> 03:51:44.730]  Anything that is an opposition to what they believe in, to the ideology that they push, they consider hate speech and they attack it as such and try to get it banned.
[03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.570]  And it is
[03:51:46.370 --> 03:52:06.209]  Such the hypocrisy is baffling to me that the American people either don't pay enough attention or don't care enough to call them out for it and hold them accountable for it and that is really it really bugs me and that hypocrisy also translates to what we're seeing in the southern border Kamala Harris today questioning the
[03:52:07.650 --> 03:52:30.206]  New head of ice or the the incoming new head of ice and asked him a question along the lines of Isn't ice you know pretty much the same as the KKK and you know just taking this to a complete racial issue where there's no racial issue About this it doesn't matter where if you had 10,000 Canadians trying to invade from the north north onto Americans
[03:52:30.526 --> 03:52:31.066]  We're good.
[03:52:48.391 --> 03:52:53.915]  The first migrant caravan arrived at the U.S.-Mexican border this week to find a fortified Tijuana port of entries.
[03:52:54.315 --> 03:52:58.838]  Now they're resting up in upscale neighborhoods paid for by American attorneys.
[03:52:59.098 --> 03:53:04.062]  They've not been welcomed with open arms by locals, according to Mexican journalist Jorge Neto.
[03:53:04.822 --> 03:53:12.707]  And it goes on to say that the first group cites mostly about 85 LGBTQ migrants, which is really weird.
[03:53:12.767 --> 03:53:18.251]  Why are there... First of all, why are they making the distinction about these people's sexual preferences?
[03:53:18.351 --> 03:53:18.411]  Yes.
[03:53:48.651 --> 03:53:49.912]  There are videos out there.
[03:53:49.932 --> 03:53:58.754]  I didn't mean to over talk you, but there are videos out there from the scene where buses were actually turned around at the border because of protesters.
[03:53:58.794 --> 03:54:00.535]  And it's because of normal people.
[03:54:00.555 --> 03:54:04.756]  The UNI, you know, the people out there who care.
[03:54:06.357 --> 03:54:08.357]  But I just want to say this.
[03:54:08.557 --> 03:54:10.478]  You asked a question about the LGBT
[03:54:11.338 --> 03:54:13.981]  Q presence at the southern border there.
[03:54:14.402 --> 03:54:14.962]  There are 76.
[03:54:15.183 --> 03:54:30.039]  It's the information I received from from my contacts 76 Members and that includes for children in many of them many of them and self-described are actually carrying diseases within the community
[03:54:30.640 --> 03:54:35.722]  But I've got my own thoughts as to why there are 76 there and what they're doing there.
[03:54:36.702 --> 03:54:45.885]  However, it would be irresponsible for me to submit my theory at this point, except to say that this is going to be highly political, highly charged.
[03:54:46.545 --> 03:54:53.647]  And it has a lot to do with the, of course, well, look, there are the immigration debates.
[03:54:54.187 --> 03:54:55.688]  Well, beyond that, go ahead.
[03:54:56.548 --> 03:54:58.109]  And the president, you know, he's done a lot.
[03:54:58.129 --> 03:54:59.170]  He sent the military down there.
[03:54:59.190 --> 03:55:00.451]  He sent the National Guard down there.
[03:55:00.491 --> 03:55:08.036]  He's changed the laws so that any person who has crossed illegally can't apply for asylum and therefore will be deported.
[03:55:08.296 --> 03:55:10.357]  But this is a make-or-break issue for President Trump.
[03:55:10.717 --> 03:55:17.302]  And if he does not take a very hard line on making sure that nobody or these people do not cross the southern border,
[03:55:17.802 --> 03:55:19.965]  He is going to lose supporters and I'm sure of that.
[03:55:20.065 --> 03:55:28.155]  He needs to make sure that he doubles, triples down his efforts to stop anybody from illegally entering through the southern border.
[03:55:28.175 --> 03:55:30.779]  Because these people believe that they have a right to come here.
[03:55:30.799 --> 03:55:32.341]  And they have a right.
[03:55:33.882 --> 03:55:35.103]  You know, we could talk about this for hours.
[03:55:35.143 --> 03:55:43.208]  I know we only have a minute left, but we do all agree that legal immigration is needed and necessary and have no problem with it.
[03:55:43.569 --> 03:55:52.454]  But the illegal immigration, the invasions, people looking to come and just basically import welfare recipients, that doesn't work and we cannot let that stand.
[03:55:52.474 --> 03:55:59.499]  You know, I would urge anyone who is interested in obtaining the truth and resources on this topic
[03:56:00.266 --> 03:56:00.647]  I don't
[03:56:21.903 --> 03:56:24.684]  Based on all of the numbers right now, you're looking at 30 million.
[03:56:25.084 --> 03:56:27.244]  And notice too, Joe, how this overlaps.
[03:56:27.324 --> 03:56:29.645]  We did some investigative work on this.
[03:56:30.145 --> 03:56:40.807]  How this overlaps into the SOS project, the Secretary of State project, the 2.0, and also the illegal voting.
[03:56:41.327 --> 03:56:43.428]  So, it's an attack on our
[03:56:44.973 --> 03:56:47.995]  Our country, the moral fabric of our country is to balkanize America.
[03:56:48.455 --> 03:56:49.516]  This is a larger issue.
[03:56:49.576 --> 03:57:03.683]  I would urge everyone, everyone out there to understand that we are right now in the fight of our lives, and that includes not just the fight of our lives as a nation, but a little bit, scale it down a little bit, but a fight of our lives as entities.
[03:57:03.844 --> 03:57:07.165]  Infowars.com, and we need to support Infowars.
[03:57:07.205 --> 03:57:13.289]  We need to support them financially, word of mouth, and of course stand shoulder to shoulder with all of the
[03:57:14.029 --> 03:57:16.952]  New media platforms telling you the truth, folks.
[03:57:17.873 --> 03:57:23.638]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, Joe Hagman, HagmanReport.com, HagmanReportLive.
[03:57:23.798 --> 03:57:25.700]  May God bless each and every one of you, Joe.
[03:57:25.860 --> 03:57:26.941]  Final word, two seconds.
[03:57:28.122 --> 03:57:28.803]  Three words.
[03:57:29.823 --> 03:57:31.505]  Energized quantum state.
[03:57:33.066 --> 03:57:33.607]  Two words.
[03:57:35.228 --> 03:57:35.248]  X3.
[03:57:36.809 --> 03:57:41.071]  You've seen how the entire global power structure is desperate to shut us down.
[03:57:41.592 --> 03:57:42.452]  And it's for good reasons.
[03:57:43.313 --> 03:57:49.396]  We've done our research, we've seen how they're targeting the people, and how they're trying to suppress the population.
[03:57:49.536 --> 03:57:53.598]  And one of their biggest attacks is fluoridation of water, the bad halogen.
[03:57:53.618 --> 03:58:02.163]  There's a bunch of bad halogens, but fluoride is chief amongst them, and then they electrify it into an acid base, so it's hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:58:03.593 --> 03:58:15.919]  Survival Shield X3 is the latest in the X family and has all three types of iodine from thousands of feet deep under the earth so it's not radioactive or be contaminated by modern chemicals.
[03:58:16.499 --> 03:58:20.561]  And it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it and stops it from being oxidized.
[03:58:20.901 --> 03:58:21.141]  Folks,
[03:58:23.081 --> 03:58:25.743]  Everything we do makes the Globals pull their hair out for a reason.
[03:58:25.963 --> 03:58:28.985]  Because, again, we study how they're attacking, what they're obsessed with.
[03:58:29.165 --> 03:58:31.586]  They are completely into iodine.
[03:58:31.926 --> 03:58:33.947]  They've even tried to buy us out and get us to stop doing this.
[03:58:35.248 --> 03:58:38.650]  And most of the forms of iodine are bound, and so you're not absorbing.
[03:58:40.171 --> 03:58:41.252]  X1, X2 were great.
[03:58:42.293 --> 03:58:42.433]  X3 is
