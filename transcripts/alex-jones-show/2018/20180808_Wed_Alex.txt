[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:35.311]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot make up the incredible global firestorm that InfoWars, and that all of our listeners and viewers are at the very center of, because believe me, you're all on the team.
[00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:37.453]  You're all the same as the quarterback.
[00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:40.015]  Without you, we're nothing, and we could lose this.
[00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:40.976]  With you, we're going to win.
[00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:49.244]  First off, the globalists are panicking because the Republicans were winning these special elections and primaries yesterday.
[00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:58.561]  They're going into total, total meltdown mode, even though big blue-blood Republicans, like the Koch brothers, have been backing the Democrats.
[00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:00.602]  Unbelievable.
[00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:04.325]  So, we're gonna be going over all that.
[00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:13.191]  You have former Obama administration officials ordering Twitter to remove me, and Jack Dorsey is still standing firm.
[00:01:14.272 --> 00:01:19.836]  We've got Howard Dean saying, I promote Nazism with no link
[00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:23.096]  And saying, take down the Nazi now.
[00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:29.599]  They're now accusing Jack Dorsey of things he's never done, saying that he's helping me dox Sandy Hook families.
[00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:30.419]  I never did that.
[00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.180]  There's no link.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.361]  Just because the New York Times says it, doesn't mean it's true.
[00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.642]  The New York Times is there to murder truth.
[00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:40.404]  The New York Times is truth's assassin.
[00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:42.185]  Continuing.
[00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:43.706]  Here's the big one.
[00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:44.886]  Document cam, shot please.
[00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:47.127]  Put it on screen from Twitter.
[00:01:47.427 --> 00:01:48.128]  Real Alex Jones.
[00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:52.922]  We are number one trending app in news.
[00:01:53.183 --> 00:01:56.044]  Number one trending.
[00:01:56.464 --> 00:01:58.225]  Click on that for a larger image, please.
[00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.006]  Number one trending.
[00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:04.187]  Guess what we are total out of thousands of news apps?
[00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:14.511]  We are number three total in the world surpassing CNN and Fox News.
[00:02:15.913 --> 00:02:17.014]  But guess what happened?
[00:02:17.154 --> 00:02:19.175]  Go to my Twitter, RealAlexJones.
[00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:20.296]  We have a video of it.
[00:02:20.316 --> 00:02:22.638]  In fact, I'm going to do a demonstration here so it's in HD.
[00:02:22.858 --> 00:02:24.059]  So I have to do or somebody show it.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.083]  Google, because we're also number one in trending on Google, and guess what?
[00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:30.464]  Number three on Google total.
[00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:33.286]  Google does not list us.
[00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:37.109]  It does not show that the app exists.
[00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.092]  This is a three week old app, InfoWars Official.
[00:02:42.393 --> 00:02:43.254]  We knew this was coming.
[00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:45.794]  I told you it was coming ahead of the midterms.
[00:02:45.854 --> 00:02:47.515]  I thought it would maybe be in a few more weeks later.
[00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:55.221]  We are number one, but it doesn't show you who's number one.
[00:02:55.801 --> 00:03:00.265]  Oh, above the Huffington Post and One America News.
[00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:04.828]  Isn't that just interesting?
[00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:07.610]  It won't show you who won the football game.
[00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.492]  They won't show you who won the wrestling match.
[00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:12.313]  They won't show you who won the Indy 500.
[00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:14.105]  Oh!
[00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:19.190]  But then, if you actually go and click into it, it comes up.
[00:03:21.872 --> 00:03:23.854]  Isn't that just special?
[00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:27.978]  How long till that's gone, gone, gone?
[00:03:28.338 --> 00:03:30.420]  But what happens when the jury sees that?
[00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:33.783]  And what happens when the jury sees this?
[00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:40.249]  Well, they think by then they've stolen the election in 2018 and 2020 and they'll have a tyranny here and it won't matter.
[00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:47.354]  But guess what CNN's been doing since they got us taken off Facebook and everywhere else?
[00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:54.719]  InfoWars app overtakes CNN on charts, CNN desperately lobbies Apple to censor.
[00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.062]  If that isn't tortious interference, if that isn't racketeering, if that isn't
[00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:26.580]  A restaurant, if CNN was a restaurant, with, you know, feces on the ground, roaches everywhere, e-coli, salmonella, food poisoning, and we've got this glistening restaurant with the most lavish chefs, great prices, parking lot overflowing, lines around the corner, and CNN's calling the fire marshal, saying, get over there, there's too many people in there, and CNN's running around the street with bullhorns, there's roaches in there the size of a chihuahua!
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.082]  There's rats the size of a Doberman!
[00:04:29.994 --> 00:04:31.275]  Don't eat there, you'll get sick!
[00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:34.177]  Meanwhile, the windows are all gross.
[00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:36.499]  Everything's falling apart.
[00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:38.300]  Nobody's over here eating in the restaurant.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.343]  CNN's got a cigarette hanging out of their mouth going, you know what you do.
[00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:46.125]  When they close at midnight, you burn that joint down!
[00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.828]  We want him four walls off the air now!
[00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:52.030]  But, oh, Trump criticizes.
[00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.410]  He's hurting the First Amendment.
[00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:55.412]  Oh, don't criticize us.
[00:04:55.432 --> 00:04:56.773]  That's violating the First Amendment.
[00:04:56.993 --> 00:04:59.495]  That is the First Amendment, you anti-American criminals!
[00:05:01.877 --> 00:05:05.559]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.783]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:12.104]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:12.264 --> 00:05:13.885]  It is absolutely free.
[00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:19.048]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:23.171]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:27.174]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:31.517]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:36.242]  Hey, have you heard?
[00:05:36.723 --> 00:05:38.785]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:40.187]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:41.388]  They're all censoring us.
[00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:47.656]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[00:05:47.976 --> 00:05:50.980]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[00:06:08.437 --> 00:06:16.982]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:17.082 --> 00:06:22.905]  It's 8-8, Wednesday, the 8th day of August 2018.
[00:06:23.265 --> 00:06:25.887]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:37.905]  My goodness, it's 888.
[00:06:39.906 --> 00:06:40.407]  Aha!
[00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:48.531]  And Infowars.com, free official app, is the number one trending app in the world.
[00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:52.473]  Number one trending app on Google Android.
[00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:55.135]  Number one on iPhone.
[00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:56.856]  And number one on other platforms.
[00:06:56.896 --> 00:07:00.337]  But guess what happens when you go to the Google free store?
[00:07:01.298 --> 00:07:02.599]  Even with all the paid apps, it's...
[00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:08.263]  Free, and it's number one, but on most phones won't show up.
[00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:13.645]  They've got it blocked on phones, but on some computers it comes up.
[00:07:13.685 --> 00:07:16.826]  And that's the same thing happened when I was the number one podcast in Joe Rogan's history.
[00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:19.367]  It was never listed on iTunes.
[00:07:19.387 --> 00:07:26.369]  You had to hand search it, but it was number one for a year, and never put to the top, because it would have gotten even bigger.
[00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:28.549]  That's how they operate.
[00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:29.749]  They force-feed what they want.
[00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:38.911]  And CNN, after they bragged, they helped get us lobbied off YouTube, Google's delisting us, Facebook, everywhere else is bullying Twitter to take us down.
[00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:41.251]  And here's the headline from Breitbart.
[00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:44.412]  InfoWars app overtakes CNN on charts.
[00:07:44.972 --> 00:07:47.012]  CNN lobbies app to censor.
[00:07:47.553 --> 00:07:49.573]  They say, we want it removed.
[00:07:49.653 --> 00:07:51.133]  We want it taken off.
[00:07:51.473 --> 00:07:55.594]  We don't want people to go to the digital store and go in and get what they want.
[00:07:58.504 --> 00:07:59.204]  No, no, no.
[00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:00.705]  CNN's app's free, too.
[00:08:01.526 --> 00:08:02.646]  But people don't want it.
[00:08:03.467 --> 00:08:04.868]  It's only been out three weeks.
[00:08:04.928 --> 00:08:06.549]  CNN has had their apps for years.
[00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:19.116]  Our app's been out three weeks and is already number one in trending, and already number three on Android and on Apple, and is trending within days to be number one total.
[00:08:21.057 --> 00:08:24.819]  And they aren't going to allow that, are they?
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.481]  4.9 star review out of five.
[00:08:29.722 --> 00:08:30.643]  Everyone loves it.
[00:08:32.905 --> 00:08:34.026]  But that's okay.
[00:08:34.727 --> 00:08:35.407]  CNN?
[00:08:35.568 --> 00:08:36.248]  Why, they're CNN.
[00:08:36.388 --> 00:08:44.056]  So, when they're not lying to you about WMDs or pushing the Arab Spring and helping kill millions of Iraqis, they're busy telling how hateful I am.
[00:08:44.096 --> 00:08:49.200]  Because when the public questions Sandy Hook, I question some of it as well and believe people have a right to question.
[00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:51.483]  And then later, years ago, said I believed it happened.
[00:08:52.183 --> 00:08:53.204]  And so they just lie.
[00:08:54.145 --> 00:09:01.607]  Say that I said nobody died at Parkland and got me taken off YouTube until YouTube went and looked and they said that was a mistake and they took the strikes off and put us back up.
[00:09:02.128 --> 00:09:09.950]  But three months later, right before the election, they were back and they lied about us again and got us taken off.
[00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.991]  CNN knew more about my account with Google than I did.
[00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:21.374]  They were in my account and talking about my account and how much money we made a month off of it and what we were doing and
[00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.131]  What was going on?
[00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:25.672]  That's from a few days when we surpassed CNN.
[00:09:25.692 --> 00:09:33.757]  Now we're number one in trending and number three on Google and on Apple.
[00:09:35.758 --> 00:09:40.681]  And within days, if not hours, we will be number one on total apps.
[00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.802]  Now, are they going to allow that?
[00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:47.285]  Are they going to allow that?
[00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:47.905]  No.
[00:09:49.426 --> 00:09:50.827]  And so, in front of the world,
[00:09:53.063 --> 00:09:59.244]  They're going to continue to attack us, and they know that we're getting record traffic to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:06.085]  So, MailChimp, we've been using for five, six years to send out under all the rules properly our emails to you every day.
[00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.126]  Notice you haven't got emails since yesterday.
[00:10:08.626 --> 00:10:11.546]  They said, no, bye-bye, you can't use us, you're evil.
[00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:20.948]  And then, you can't comment on InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com, when it's a very popular function, with Discus, or Discuss,
[00:10:22.554 --> 00:10:23.054]  That's gone!
[00:10:23.815 --> 00:10:29.499]  They just said, no, you violate our terms of service, even though it's their moderators and their system.
[00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:33.261]  That's why we liked it, because it's hard to moderate all this stuff.
[00:10:35.543 --> 00:10:38.465]  And so what they're saying is they violate their own terms.
[00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:40.086]  Now what you're doing is you're racketeering.
[00:10:40.762 --> 00:10:43.724]  You're going to come out and you're going to deny us services on our own website.
[00:10:44.565 --> 00:10:46.366]  Oh, but it's their own company, really.
[00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:55.812]  Samsung TVs say, when you buy this TV, you waive your rights, we can watch and listen to you in your home and share it with third parties, because we're our own company.
[00:10:58.314 --> 00:11:02.097]  How about all these congressmen and women running for office, neck and neck with Democrats?
[00:11:02.117 --> 00:11:08.281]  Democrats can all advertise, they can all be political on their Facebook pages and YouTube pages, but Republicans are all being blocked as well.
[00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:10.988]  Is that just because they're a company now?
[00:11:12.309 --> 00:11:17.970]  Maybe AT&T will tell the Republicans, you can only use your telephones, you know, 10% of the time.
[00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:24.832]  You'd be like, well I pay for service, you can't be letting me only use the phone 10% of the time and letting the Democrats use it 100%.
[00:11:25.112 --> 00:11:27.112]  That's what this shadow banning and all this is.
[00:11:28.753 --> 00:11:32.914]  So why did Jack Dorsey come out and say Alex Jones hasn't violated our rules?
[00:11:34.977 --> 00:11:41.081]  Their rules are nebulous, their rules are globalist, their rules are like SJW stuff, where no one can follow them.
[00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:42.482]  It's all subjective.
[00:11:42.522 --> 00:11:43.383]  What is hate speech?
[00:11:45.124 --> 00:11:47.486]  One man's hate speech is one man's religion, vice versa.
[00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:53.330]  They let the Islamists do whatever they want, but if you criticize it, you get restricted.
[00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.312]  And Twitter knows that Trump came out a week and a half ago.
[00:11:58.877 --> 00:12:00.318]  Tweet up there for the President, we can find it.
[00:12:00.738 --> 00:12:06.803]  And the President said, you know, this shadow banning, I'm getting a lot of reports of it, of Congress people and other Republicans and Conservatives.
[00:12:07.744 --> 00:12:08.624]  Very, very troubling.
[00:12:08.904 --> 00:12:09.565]  It's illegal.
[00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:10.546]  Going to do something about it.
[00:12:10.566 --> 00:12:18.752]  So I believe the reason Jack Dorsey didn't join the rest of the PAC in banning me, like he did Milo a few years ago,
[00:12:19.847 --> 00:12:26.038]  It's because he knows that Trump and this broadcast and the Republican Congress is aware of what's going on.
[00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:30.726]  And suddenly, days after Trump put that tweet out, suddenly we were only
[00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:34.802]  Restricted in some of our tweets.
[00:12:35.342 --> 00:12:36.523]  Most of them actually went out.
[00:12:36.643 --> 00:12:39.265]  So instead of getting 5 retweets, we'd get 10,000 again.
[00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:50.311]  Now some that somebody dubbed political or something, which everybody else can do, Trump crossing the swamp as George Washington, stuff like that would still get blocked.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.225]  So, you can see they're in there still trying to bend it to the Democrats.
[00:12:55.346 --> 00:12:55.686]  Bend it.
[00:12:55.886 --> 00:12:57.028]  But they know they're getting washed.
[00:12:57.048 --> 00:13:01.914]  But they think, hey, if they can just make it three months to get Democrats in, the impeachment can start, and then it'll be okay.
[00:13:02.155 --> 00:13:05.699]  But if they lose, if it doesn't work, there's gonna be hell to pay.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:06.961]  But maybe not.
[00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:12.925]  The Republican Congress is so stupid when it comes to tech and these issues.
[00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:14.106]  So dumb.
[00:13:14.406 --> 00:13:15.307]  The terms they use.
[00:13:15.767 --> 00:13:16.688]  The Democrats are too.
[00:13:16.888 --> 00:13:21.652]  The Democrat Senator Murphy calling us the rotten tip of the iceberg saying ban all the conservatives.
[00:13:22.172 --> 00:13:23.533]  Incredibly out in the open.
[00:13:23.733 --> 00:13:26.916]  He goes, banning just one website isn't enough.
[00:13:27.536 --> 00:13:29.638]  Which he's admitting, they're trying to ban our site itself.
[00:13:30.238 --> 00:13:31.199]  We need to ban them all.
[00:13:32.742 --> 00:13:36.569]  What he's really banning is our multimedia, our reporters, our people, our guests.
[00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:42.660]  They're saying all of you can't be on Facebook, all of you can't be on YouTube, all of you can't be on all these platforms.
[00:13:44.835 --> 00:13:50.538]  iTunes, everywhere else, and then they're testing to see, will Joe Rogan have me on to defend free speech?
[00:13:50.558 --> 00:13:52.659]  He was already telling me two weeks ago he wants me on, I haven't heard the time.
[00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:53.759]  Now will he?
[00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.681]  Or will he get scared and not thinking, keep his head down?
[00:13:56.801 --> 00:13:58.362]  Because then later, he'll lose his speech.
[00:13:58.762 --> 00:14:00.242]  And will everybody else have me on?
[00:14:00.583 --> 00:14:04.064]  Well the truth is, people are lining up around the block to have me on their broadcast.
[00:14:04.404 --> 00:14:09.087]  People invite me on all the time, I'm usually too busy, but I've been doing it, working really hard, doing a lot of interviews.
[00:14:10.034 --> 00:14:17.438]  Because I need to fight for free speech right now, not just my speech, but everybody's, because we're domino number one, make no mistake.
[00:14:18.078 --> 00:14:31.444]  So Howard Dean, all these Obama people, they're demanding we be taken down, and now they're more shrill because their socialist star, Alexandria Cortez, had all the people she endorsed lose their primaries.
[00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:35.146]  Yeah, when you tell folks you're a commie, it doesn't work too well.
[00:14:36.647 --> 00:14:39.188]  So they're now in panic mode as Republicans won,
[00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:48.194]  These key battleground areas that Soros poured mega-tons, hundreds of millions of dollars of illegal money into this stuff.
[00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:51.796]  And they are swinging for the fences with brass knuckles.
[00:14:52.476 --> 00:15:00.821]  We're wearing, you know, 10-ounce gloves, but we're still defeating them, even though it's rigged, because people know what's going on and the jig is up.
[00:15:01.721 --> 00:15:05.262]  So, newswars.com, infowars.com.

[00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.071]  Tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, hey, the battle for the First Amendment's now.
[00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:30.851]  They're trying to ban Alex Jones.
[00:15:30.871 --> 00:15:31.612]  They're lying about it.
[00:15:31.632 --> 00:15:32.412]  They're demonizing him.
[00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:34.572]  So they can take him down, they can take everybody down.
[00:15:34.813 --> 00:15:37.113]  We need to stand with Alex Jones in free speech.
[00:15:37.693 --> 00:15:39.834]  Not just go, well, Alex Jones is a bad guy.
[00:15:39.854 --> 00:15:40.634]  You mean the straw man?
[00:15:41.034 --> 00:15:44.575]  Well, what the media says is a bad guy, but, you know, he still should have a speech.
[00:15:45.035 --> 00:15:46.376]  No, don't say I'm a bad guy.
[00:15:46.616 --> 00:15:47.256]  Go all the way.
[00:15:47.336 --> 00:15:47.876]  Double down.
[00:15:47.936 --> 00:15:48.336]  Stand up.
[00:15:48.356 --> 00:15:50.757]  Because they'll be demonizing and lying about you next.
[00:15:51.437 --> 00:15:55.698]  We've got so much huge news in the fight for the Republic and the fight for the world straight ahead.

[00:20:24.575 --> 00:20:26.695]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:27.196 --> 00:20:28.636]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:33.017 --> 00:20:34.158]  This is America.
[00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:41.040]  This is 2018, three months out from one of the most important elections in our history and affecting the entire world.
[00:20:43.126 --> 00:20:47.961]  And finally, the Daily Mail, Breitbart, following Drudge's lead that started a week ago.
[00:20:50.097 --> 00:20:52.498]  They are coming out to our defense saying this is dangerous.
[00:20:52.518 --> 00:20:58.561]  They're having top lawyers, top computer scientists on the site, on XM, on their Breitbart show.
[00:20:58.581 --> 00:21:12.447]  I was listening to it for hours this morning, reading all their reports, and they're going into the scientific history, how the racketeering's working, how it's illegal, how they're building sites to monitor it, how Congress has got to stop this right now, how this is trying to steal the election.
[00:21:12.547 --> 00:21:14.268]  True election meddling.
[00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:19.656]  And now, InfoWars app overtakes CNN on charts.
[00:21:21.077 --> 00:21:25.059]  CNN lobbies Apple to censor.
[00:21:26.599 --> 00:21:27.380]  You heard me right.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.881]  InfoWars shot up the charts.
[00:21:29.941 --> 00:21:38.105]  It's gone to number one in new apps, trending number one, and it's number three set in days to go to number one total.
[00:21:40.146 --> 00:21:42.327]  InfoWars app overtakes CNN on charts.
[00:21:42.387 --> 00:21:44.148]  CNN lobbies Apple to censor.
[00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:47.539]  This is America.
[00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:48.880]  This isn't the old Soviet Union.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.080]  This isn't communist China.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.061]  And what do you expect?
[00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:56.723]  Google is on the air in China with their propaganda.
[00:21:57.003 --> 00:22:02.706]  Google is moving back into China with their own censorship and media system.
[00:22:03.106 --> 00:22:03.326]  Apple
[00:22:04.724 --> 00:22:09.006]  Has its media company based there, and it's openly involved in mass censorship.
[00:22:09.706 --> 00:22:15.930]  Apple has officially moved to China years ago, but made it official five months ago and became state-run.
[00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.771]  And I'm the only person hammering this, or at least I was.
[00:22:21.332 --> 00:22:24.554]  Now, the information is coming out.
[00:22:25.996 --> 00:22:27.257]  And Congress is talking about it.
[00:22:27.277 --> 00:22:39.428]  They're catching Chinese spies inside the National Security Agency, inside the CIA, inside the FBI, inside the House Intelligence and Senate Intelligence Committee, offices of Dianne Feinstein and others.
[00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:43.392]  Obama and the globalists allowed total penetration.
[00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:55.824]  Don't you remember when they kept having Chinese generals in the White House for fundraisers and giving them millions of dollars illegally with suitcases of cash and no one got in trouble?
[00:22:56.424 --> 00:22:57.425]  That was in 1995.
[00:23:00.327 --> 00:22:57.425]  96.
[00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:03.089]  Can you imagine what it's like now?
[00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:04.530]  Total penetration.
[00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.131]  They own our debt.
[00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:06.931]  They own Hollywood.
[00:23:07.312 --> 00:23:10.814]  They've gotten all the major defense secrets that aren't completely classified.
[00:23:11.434 --> 00:23:11.895]  They have
[00:23:13.424 --> 00:23:14.585]  Pushed for us to be censored.
[00:23:14.605 --> 00:23:16.807]  They go to Davos and brag how they're going to take down America.
[00:23:17.087 --> 00:23:18.508]  And I keep telling you this!
[00:23:18.889 --> 00:23:23.352]  And that's why they finally moved and jumped the shark to ban me off the Internet.
[00:23:25.094 --> 00:23:30.638]  Because the President is listening, the campaign is listening, the military is listening, and they don't know what to do.
[00:23:30.698 --> 00:23:32.039]  And let me give you a little news flash.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.602]  The military already knew all of this.
[00:23:36.683 --> 00:23:39.586]  They had made the decision it was too damning to tell the American people
[00:23:40.831 --> 00:23:49.357]  And they thought they could fix it by turning the economy back on and quietly pulling out the traitors that were managing the Chai Com spies, because it's kind of a wedding between Deep State, the globalists, and China.
[00:23:49.638 --> 00:23:51.939]  Say China runs us, I mean, we have total penetration.
[00:23:52.299 --> 00:23:55.462]  Then they started double-crossing Obama the last two years of his administration, remember?
[00:23:56.775 --> 00:24:01.076]  So to keep some leverage on them, the Deep State went, oh yeah, we'll pivot some ships and stuff out to where you're at.
[00:24:01.096 --> 00:24:04.198]  And they said, we're building islands, get out of the way, we've compromised you.
[00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:09.059]  If you talk bad about us, we'll expose people on your payroll, on our payroll.
[00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:18.262]  Remember that when China said a couple years ago, before Trump got elected, they said, if you keep giving us trouble with your pivot to Asia and all this China stuff, we'll start outing spies.
[00:24:19.623 --> 00:24:25.025]  And then, as if that wasn't a big enough red flare, 5,000 red flares,
[00:24:27.363 --> 00:24:31.724]  Because if that wasn't totally insane, it got worse, didn't it?
[00:24:32.364 --> 00:24:36.305]  They came out yesterday and they said, we already own Apple and control its factories.
[00:24:37.185 --> 00:24:37.925]  They've merged with us.
[00:24:37.945 --> 00:24:38.685]  We have all the codes.
[00:24:39.146 --> 00:24:44.087]  We will hold it hostage and shut down production to your trillion dollar thing if you don't do that.
[00:24:44.307 --> 00:24:45.667]  Well, it's not ours anyways.
[00:24:46.487 --> 00:24:48.868]  And yeah, do iPhones, in my experience, work better than most droids?
[00:24:49.248 --> 00:24:49.828]  Okay, yeah.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.522]  The issue is Apple is as evil as it gets.
[00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:56.542]  It's the worst.
[00:24:56.802 --> 00:24:58.924]  And Google's a close second moving to China.
[00:25:00.445 --> 00:25:02.226]  So what do they do when they're traders like this?
[00:25:03.207 --> 00:25:06.228]  They say that America is run by Russians.
[00:25:06.929 --> 00:25:10.191]  When the Russians are tough, they can fight, they can build rockets, they got missiles.
[00:25:11.112 --> 00:25:12.513]  They can't even keep their country running.
[00:25:12.713 --> 00:25:15.855]  If Russia was in our business, I'd be on their ass.
[00:25:16.555 --> 00:25:18.556]  Like I was during the whole uranium deals with Hillary.
[00:25:18.697 --> 00:25:19.137]  That's wrong!
[00:25:23.339 --> 00:25:24.921]  Russia's not the threat, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:24.941 --> 00:25:28.224]  That's how they project onto Trump, a nationalist, that he's a traitor.
[00:25:29.805 --> 00:25:34.650]  The New York Times, and I'm going to get around to going through the two hours of audio and finding this clip.
[00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:35.411]  I want to play it today.
[00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:37.553]  The New York Times had this report.
[00:25:37.573 --> 00:25:39.475]  It's working with this other Pulitzer Prize winner.
[00:25:39.855 --> 00:25:41.197]  That's like a Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:25:41.237 --> 00:25:44.600]  It means it's like an Iron Cross, in my opinion, from Adolf Hitler.
[00:25:46.222 --> 00:25:47.303]  These assassins of truth.
[00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:49.949]  These twisters.
[00:25:51.629 --> 00:25:57.631]  And the lady sat back in her chair and she went, tell me about how you work for RT.
[00:25:57.691 --> 00:25:58.291]  And I went, huh?
[00:25:59.111 --> 00:26:01.431]  Yeah, what they pay you, all this other stuff.
[00:26:02.192 --> 00:26:03.652]  And she was rolling her eyes.
[00:26:03.692 --> 00:26:07.193]  And I was like, I've never worked for RT.
[00:26:07.213 --> 00:26:08.273]  I've never gotten money from RT.
[00:26:08.293 --> 00:26:09.313]  I've never traveled with RT.
[00:26:09.353 --> 00:26:10.313]  I haven't been on RT in years.
[00:26:10.633 --> 00:26:12.854]  I'm like, I've been interviewed by the New York Times probably 100 times.
[00:26:12.874 --> 00:26:14.054]  Do I work for you, lady?
[00:26:16.094 --> 00:26:19.055]  That's how sick this has gotten, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:20.842 --> 00:26:23.944]  And I mean, these people are in their own echo chamber of America hating.
[00:26:24.424 --> 00:26:26.245]  They're in their own echo chamber of control.
[00:26:26.265 --> 00:26:29.628]  They're in their own echo chamber where they've got to do this or they won't get their paycheck.
[00:26:29.648 --> 00:26:30.948]  So they believe this stuff.
[00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:44.317]  And they get extremely radicalized until they don't even know what planet they're on, where they scream, Nazi scum, and won't let Candace Owens, a beautiful black lady, a patriot, a liberal,
[00:26:45.239 --> 00:26:47.501]  Have her meal, because she's pro-America.
[00:26:48.102 --> 00:26:51.825]  A bunch of weird white people screaming at a black lady, you're a white supremacist.
[00:26:52.806 --> 00:26:53.327]  They're bullies!
[00:26:53.927 --> 00:26:54.428]  They're crazy!
[00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:55.689]  They're out of control.
[00:26:55.909 --> 00:27:00.454]  Now, obviously we need funding under this massive attack.
[00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:10.053]  We need it extremely bad, and if you haven't gone to InfoWarsStore.com, we got the best water filters at the best prices, the best air filtration, all of it.
[00:27:10.113 --> 00:27:14.875]  We got the best non-GMO heirloom seeds, we got the best game-changing supplements, and they hate it when you fund us.
[00:27:15.116 --> 00:27:16.776]  Plus, you need all of these.
[00:27:17.937 --> 00:27:20.218]  So we're launching a mega-sale because of all of this.
[00:27:20.678 --> 00:27:21.718]  Stop the censorship.
[00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:25.680]  Save InfoWars Special.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.721]  Stand up against the bullies.
[00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:28.841]  Stop the censorship.
[00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:30.022]  I think I'll change the name of the special.
[00:27:32.338 --> 00:27:33.699]  Stop the big tech bullies.
[00:27:33.839 --> 00:27:34.460]  Save the Internet.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.821]  Save InfoWars Super Special.
[00:27:36.622 --> 00:27:40.485]  The mainstream media, the dying dinosaurs, are doing everything they can to shut down InfoWars.
[00:27:41.386 --> 00:27:43.268]  All the tech giants work to remove us from the Internet.
[00:27:43.929 --> 00:27:45.190]  We're being de-personed.
[00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.631]  We're being disappeared.
[00:27:46.671 --> 00:27:49.293]  We're being put in an electronic ghetto.

[00:28:57.277 --> 00:28:58.397]  Oh, Gavin McGinnis coming up!
[00:28:58.437 --> 00:28:58.918]  Gavin McGinnis!
[00:29:03.297 --> 00:29:09.641]  Brandon, please, lay out what you said and then also how they're attacking you and, you know, their ridiculous disinfo.
[00:29:09.661 --> 00:29:22.730]  Because when people walk away from the Democrats, and in capitals across the country and in D.C., come together and hug each other, left and right, for a future of America and the Antifa shows up and there's only a half dozen of them, it is going to be
[00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.772]  Martin Luther King level, I have a dream stuff.
[00:29:25.812 --> 00:29:27.713]  I mean, I just know destiny when I hear it.
[00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:30.735]  I think you should tell people your millennium level idea.
[00:29:30.775 --> 00:29:36.198]  I mean, it's like one of those ideas that you only hear a few times in a lifetime and usually people ignore it.
[00:29:36.298 --> 00:29:36.999]  This is history.
[00:29:37.299 --> 00:29:40.181]  That's why there's... so please tell folks the idea you came up with.
[00:29:40.461 --> 00:29:41.302]  Yeah, you got it, Alex.
[00:29:41.422 --> 00:29:47.188]  You know, a lot of what's coming out of the left right now is this narrative that my campaign is Russian bots, which is absolutely ridiculous.
[00:29:47.308 --> 00:29:49.951]  Of course, we have real people giving testimonials for the WalkAway campaign.
[00:29:50.432 --> 00:30:00.002]  But it sort of sparked an idea in my mind, since there's going to be a lot of naysayers out there who are going to try to dismiss this campaign and what's happening with WalkAway as bots and as not real.
[00:30:00.142 --> 00:30:02.305]  I thought to myself, you know, what we really need to do
[00:30:03.246 --> 00:30:10.133]  I'm going to organize a walk away march on Washington, a nationwide walk away march.
[00:30:10.793 --> 00:30:18.562]  And what this is going to be is really unifying people from the left, unifying people from the right, bringing everybody together kind of on the same page.
[00:30:19.343 --> 00:30:32.659]  And listen, if you're not walking away from the Democrat Party, that's fine, but I think that at this point people should at least be willing to say, I'm walking away from the hatefulness, I'm walking away from the divisiveness, I'm walking away from the violent rhetoric and the division.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.862]  So this is what I want to do.
[00:30:34.882 --> 00:30:36.103]  I want to, in the fall,
[00:30:36.704 --> 00:30:43.834]  We have an amazing demonstration organization nationwide where we do a nationwide march on Washington.
[00:30:43.914 --> 00:30:48.480]  I want it to be the biggest, most incredible, and most powerful march this nation has ever seen.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.842]  You need to be flooded, folks.
[00:30:49.862 --> 00:30:52.625]  And believe me, I know at a gut level what's going to work and what's not.
[00:30:52.665 --> 00:30:53.867]  So if people fund this...
[00:30:54.788 --> 00:30:56.369]  I couldn't see a better place for people to do it.
[00:30:56.409 --> 00:31:00.331]  So I'm pledging $10,000 that we'll donate right after the show to the account.
[00:31:00.351 --> 00:31:00.951]  I want it online.
[00:31:00.971 --> 00:31:02.472]  I want people to see that happen.
[00:31:02.712 --> 00:31:03.892]  So please make sure that happens.
[00:31:04.032 --> 00:31:05.673]  There are two ways that people can donate.
[00:31:06.053 --> 00:31:09.555]  I've set up a GoFundMe and I've set up a Patreon account.
[00:31:09.695 --> 00:31:15.878]  Both of these things are accessible if they go to walkawaycampaign.com and click on sponsorship.
[00:31:16.438 --> 00:31:20.939]  The GoFundMe is great if you're somebody who's just able to make a one-time donation of any amount.
[00:31:20.959 --> 00:31:22.520]  We appreciate anything that you can do.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.440]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.660]  Thank you so much.
[00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:31.362]  I had a feeling that you would be somebody who would be very enthusiastic about this, and I feel exactly the same way you do.
[00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:41.705]  I mean, it was my idea, but I also thought to myself, this is something that really possibly not only has the potential to do a lot of healing, but possibly even preventing a civil war.
[00:31:42.125 --> 00:31:43.467]  And you're just saying, just walk away.
[00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:44.649]  Like, it means don't fight.
[00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:47.053]  It means, just, just don't be under this cult control.
[00:31:47.233 --> 00:31:49.036]  Oh, this is divinely inspired.
[00:31:49.096 --> 00:31:53.923]  I'm telling, I know the zeitgeist when I'm close to it, and I am now in the center of it.
[00:31:54.243 --> 00:31:54.884]  Oh, ooh.
[00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:09.996]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[00:32:10.336 --> 00:32:12.398]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:23.405]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts, like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasting radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:30.009]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.

[00:32:42.998 --> 00:32:43.979]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:49.503]  Download the InfoWars official app for tomorrow's news today for free from the Apple Store or Google Play.
[00:33:04.272 --> 00:33:07.013]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.242 --> 00:33:27.184]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:27.744 --> 00:33:29.125]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:41.662]  Gavin McInnes, the creator of Vice, filmmaker, syndicated talk show host at CRTV.com.
[00:33:42.042 --> 00:33:43.022]  Join us until the end of the hour.
[00:33:43.042 --> 00:33:43.962]  We have a bunch of other guests.
[00:33:44.042 --> 00:33:46.503]  And I want to open the phones up and get your take on what's happening.
[00:33:46.523 --> 00:33:48.903]  But make no mistake, people are now finally getting it.
[00:33:49.564 --> 00:34:00.006]  Congress didn't understand how the shadow banning was happening, how Google was delisting people, how the different forms of algorithm strangulation was happening ahead of trying to steal the election.
[00:34:00.046 --> 00:34:03.427]  And that's what this is, is election meddling by big tech, the Democrats, and others.
[00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:05.628]  But now they've jumped the shark.
[00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:10.333]  They had hearings in the last few months where the Republicans just couldn't find their butt with both hands.
[00:34:11.014 --> 00:34:17.039]  And it green-lighted the intensified censorship, not just of me, but everybody else.
[00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:18.100]  There's big algorithms.
[00:34:18.541 --> 00:34:27.109]  Breitbart's been doing a great job with some of their scientists and computer people and some of the groups in Europe that can track the different types of censorship, not just shadow banning.
[00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:41.466]  They've dialed it back 50% basically back during Hillary, during the campaign two years ago, and then it went up to about 80% about a month ago, and now it's gone about 93% on average.
[00:34:41.786 --> 00:34:46.328]  And I gave you those numbers before Facebook admitted, oh we already dialed back conservatives 80%, quit bitching at us.
[00:34:47.048 --> 00:34:54.491]  Because I could see Google Analytics, I could see the Facebook analytics, we're kicked out of all that now, and it's just like space age.
[00:34:54.791 --> 00:34:57.612]  And you can see when they put the controls in, you go straight down.
[00:34:58.472 --> 00:35:00.073]  It's not like you go down like this or something.
[00:35:01.477 --> 00:35:02.358]  They just flip a switch.
[00:35:02.438 --> 00:35:09.144]  It's like, you know, when Hillary lost, Alexa just, you know, took 2,000 conservative sites and did 80% reduction in them, too.
[00:35:09.504 --> 00:35:13.668]  It wasn't like the traffic was down, but sponsors looked at it and went, well, your traffic's down.
[00:35:13.688 --> 00:35:14.508]  It's like, no, I'm not.
[00:35:14.528 --> 00:35:17.050]  It's like when they told Mark Twain he was dead, and he said, no, I'm not.
[00:35:17.891 --> 00:35:22.658]  Or it's like, you know, if you hit me in the face and I punch you and you fall down and you look at me and you say, I've killed you.
[00:35:22.678 --> 00:35:24.481]  And I'm like, looks like I'm still standing here, buddy.
[00:35:24.521 --> 00:35:28.287]  So they've tried a lot of different fraud, but they're desperately moving now.
[00:35:28.728 --> 00:35:31.432]  They're trying to bully Jack Dorsey into removing me.
[00:35:31.472 --> 00:35:33.274]  Let me ask Gavin again, this is a smart cookie.
[00:35:35.023 --> 00:35:36.664]  Why do you think they're doing all this now?
[00:35:36.824 --> 00:35:37.925]  Do you think they'll get away with it?
[00:35:37.945 --> 00:35:42.249]  Because folks seem to be figuring out that I'm just patient zero as the beta test going into the election.
[00:35:43.049 --> 00:35:46.152]  And if they win, they're really going to crack down even more and I guess solidify this.
[00:35:46.252 --> 00:35:54.278]  And why do you think Dorsey hasn't banned me when like 15 platforms, I can't list them all, WebChimp, Disqus,
[00:35:55.158 --> 00:35:58.761]  You know, not just iTunes, not just Facebook, not just YouTube, just everywhere.
[00:35:59.021 --> 00:36:04.004]  And now it appears they're de-platforming, deleting other people that put my new videos up they grab.
[00:36:04.044 --> 00:36:08.147]  So, I mean, this is, this is like beyond even what you hear about in China.
[00:36:08.187 --> 00:36:09.008]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:36:09.228 --> 00:36:10.288]  What does Gab McGinnis think?
[00:36:11.749 --> 00:36:16.893]  I think that Jack is smarter than these other CEOs and he knows
[00:36:17.418 --> 00:36:20.020]  That this is bad for the left.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.262]  I don't think Jack wants Trump to win.
[00:36:23.302 --> 00:36:24.523]  I don't think he likes you.
[00:36:25.043 --> 00:36:32.147]  But at least he has the tenacity to realize that when you shut down Alex Jones, you make him stronger.
[00:36:32.207 --> 00:36:34.049]  You have the number one app.
[00:36:34.089 --> 00:36:35.269]  I talked to you yesterday.
[00:36:35.289 --> 00:36:37.151]  It was a number four app.
[00:36:37.691 --> 00:36:42.334]  Jack is smart enough to know that just trying to kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:36:43.976 --> 00:36:44.676]  We do.
[00:36:44.856 --> 00:36:46.297]  Now, as you speak, it's actually gone.
[00:36:46.697 --> 00:36:49.078]  It is now number one in news on all platforms.
[00:36:49.358 --> 00:36:52.280]  But most Google devices won't show you that it's number one.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:53.560]  I know.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.121]  It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
[00:36:55.521 --> 00:36:59.583]  You scroll, and as you're scrolling, it won't let you go past two.
[00:36:59.963 --> 00:37:01.183]  They're so bad at this.
[00:37:01.463 --> 00:37:03.344]  You know, I'm going to hand it to Stalin.
[00:37:03.624 --> 00:37:07.006]  He was much more efficient at fascism than these guys.
[00:37:07.046 --> 00:37:09.327]  This is amateur hour at the Apollo.
[00:37:10.512 --> 00:37:10.972]  I agree with you.
[00:37:10.992 --> 00:37:11.853]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:37:11.873 --> 00:37:20.958]  It's a parallel to three African countries in the last 30 years have kicked the minority white population out, taken the farms, and within a few years they're starving to death.
[00:37:20.978 --> 00:37:22.199]  Zimbabwe, many other examples.
[00:37:22.499 --> 00:37:25.401]  Will the racist communist leaders of South Africa
[00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:33.447]  are now kicking most of the whites out, taking their farms, and famine has now kicked off just one year into the new communist government.
[00:37:33.507 --> 00:37:33.727]  Wow!
[00:37:33.747 --> 00:37:53.102]  I mean, you'd think, again, just like them kicking conservatives and libertarians off the web, and then their stock tanks hundreds of billions at Facebook, you'd think that South Africa, when nations bordering them, have done the exact same thing and starved to death en masse and collapsed, you'd think they'd say, hey, let's leave these productive Christian farmers here.
[00:37:54.278 --> 00:37:54.679]  You know what?
[00:37:55.219 --> 00:38:00.127]  This is a lot like your case in the sense that everyone has this sort of
[00:38:00.917 --> 00:38:06.562]  A fortune cookie little note explaining what the story is and it's not even close to the truth.
[00:38:06.862 --> 00:38:09.324]  So no one's seen your show that wants to ban it.
[00:38:09.524 --> 00:38:13.887]  They just heard rumors about conspiracy theories and you attacking kids and all this stuff.
[00:38:14.128 --> 00:38:16.069]  They've never actually watched the show.
[00:38:16.389 --> 00:38:17.250]  Same with Anne Coulter.
[00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.890]  They hate her books.
[00:38:18.131 --> 00:38:21.053]  They've never actually read one sentence in any of her books.
[00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:23.355]  It's all based on the rumors, the mystique.
[00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:24.396]  It's a game of telephone.
[00:38:24.776 --> 00:38:25.937]  And with South Africa,
[00:38:26.497 --> 00:38:32.361]  The rumor is, whites came in, stole all the land, and now the blacks are saying, we'd like our land back at some point.
[00:38:32.621 --> 00:38:33.482]  That sounds reasonable.
[00:38:33.522 --> 00:38:35.303]  I mean, they had apartheid, that was mean.
[00:38:35.764 --> 00:38:37.004]  That's not the truth at all!
[00:38:37.465 --> 00:38:49.393]  The story there is that there is one communist party that is oppressing everyone in South Africa, including blacks, including other tribes, and especially including white farmers.
[00:38:50.323 --> 00:38:55.067]  And these National Socialists, just like the Nazis, in fact, they have a tenant now.
[00:38:55.567 --> 00:38:57.229]  Land seizure without compensation.
[00:38:57.289 --> 00:39:05.675]  That is literally, word for word, as Dinesh D'Souza points out in his new movie, Death of a Nation, that is literally, word for word, a Nazi doctrine.
[00:39:05.996 --> 00:39:11.780]  So, the rumors you're hearing about South Africa, that it's about, you know, white, black people getting revenge for whites.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.762]  No, the whites bought that land.
[00:39:13.802 --> 00:39:15.503]  That was all acquired justly.
[00:39:15.763 --> 00:39:18.986]  There was no one really there when the Boers settled South Africa.
[00:39:19.446 --> 00:39:37.354]  No, you've done your study, because just like the Boers were kind of like Amish-lite, most Amish actually are German, or Swiss, but they're very similar, so I've read several, four or five books about the whole history of South Africa, and as you said, almost no one was there except, quote, what they call the Aborigines, or the natives, or the bush people.
[00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:47.100]  And then when the whites came in 400 years ago and built wells and infrastructure, there were giant migrations moving in for the work in the diamond mines and the fields.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.181]  And so they built this whole big giant thing.
[00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:49.901]  No one was there.
[00:39:50.302 --> 00:39:51.542]  Kind of like, you know, Texas.
[00:39:51.562 --> 00:39:53.183]  There might have been a couple thousand Native Americans.
[00:39:53.203 --> 00:39:56.465]  And I'm not saying it's good what happened to them, but everybody wants to get here now because of what we built.
[00:39:56.806 --> 00:40:00.088]  And now the Communist Party that Mandela was part of takes over.
[00:40:00.874 --> 00:40:20.537]  Makes it all racial, and now you've got these super-Christian 9% of the population of Christian farmers that are in the middle of nowhere, you know, with lions and king cobras and everything, and all the local blacks are like, please don't get rid of them, we love working with them, but that's all about to be torn out, then the Communists will communalize everything and it'll all collapse like happened in China.
[00:40:21.544 --> 00:40:23.467]  They're almost out of water in Cape Town.
[00:40:23.827 --> 00:40:25.690]  This always happens with communism.
[00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:29.435]  It hurts the people it's purporting to help and leaves everyone starving.
[00:40:29.716 --> 00:40:36.485]  They are going to be starving something like 85% I forget the exact number but it's remarkably high of these farms they take over.
[00:40:37.126 --> 00:40:38.007]  ...cease to be farms.
[00:40:38.307 --> 00:40:43.132]  They just subsist farm a few beans for themselves, and all the crops die.
[00:40:43.473 --> 00:40:55.005]  So they're running out of food, running out of water, based on communist greed, and people are going for the fortune cookie version, which is, it's just a minor land transaction.
[00:40:55.425 --> 00:40:58.127]  You know, you keep seeing this again and again, and what happens?
[00:40:58.507 --> 00:41:00.048]  People starve.
[00:41:00.209 --> 00:41:03.691]  And this is what's happening with you.
[00:41:04.011 --> 00:41:09.896]  They're going to say, no more Alex Jones, no more me, no more Candace Owens they're going after now.
[00:41:10.296 --> 00:41:14.299]  This is a woman who dared to say blacks don't have to be conservative, I mean liberal.
[00:41:14.899 --> 00:41:19.723]  And they're going to end up with much less media, with just state-run media.
[00:41:22.739 --> 00:41:23.559]  You're absolutely right.
[00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:24.740]  We'll come back and play that video.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.101]  I should have gotten to this the last few days.
[00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:26.681]  I mentioned it.
[00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:32.824]  Antifa protesters across conservative Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens at Philadelphia Cafe.
[00:41:33.184 --> 00:41:33.944]  This happens to me.
[00:41:34.004 --> 00:41:34.825]  It happens to Milo.
[00:41:35.265 --> 00:41:37.246]  And they literally start screaming Nazi.
[00:41:37.486 --> 00:41:40.727]  Howard Dean has called me a Nazi and called for Twitter to ban me.
[00:41:41.167 --> 00:41:43.769]  Folks, everyone knows the Nazis hate me.
[00:41:44.249 --> 00:41:46.250]  Everybody knows my ex-wife is part Jewish.
[00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.211]  Everybody knows that I'm not anti-Israel.
[00:41:49.031 --> 00:41:54.535]  But they just keep calling me a Nazi, and then they're screaming at a black woman, screaming, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi!
[00:41:54.735 --> 00:41:56.016]  These people are insane!
[00:41:59.038 --> 00:42:01.539]  Where's it gonna go, Gavin?
[00:42:01.639 --> 00:42:02.940]  You know what they were screaming?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.224]  They were screaming, end white supremacy, and F white supremacy, at a black woman.
[00:42:09.244 --> 00:42:13.207]  And then some of the alt-left say, no, no, no, they were screaming at a Charlie Kirk.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.801]  No, they were not screaming at Charlie Kirk.
[00:42:15.841 --> 00:42:25.286]  They had a bullhorn in Candace's face that she had to physically tear away with her hands as they poured water on Charlie Kirk and screamed like hyenas.
[00:42:25.686 --> 00:42:26.907]  You know they're all rich kids.
[00:42:27.527 --> 00:42:29.608]  And you know what I was thinking the other day?
[00:42:30.088 --> 00:42:32.910]  I'm becoming scared of the left.
[00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.492]  And I don't mean scared like Tony Soprano is out to get me.
[00:42:36.912 --> 00:42:38.933]  I mean scared like a psychotic
[00:42:39.426 --> 00:42:43.031]  Ex-girlfriend who's a stalker and is about to get out of jail.
[00:42:43.211 --> 00:42:44.833]  Well, you know what I'm afraid of?
[00:42:45.614 --> 00:42:46.035]  I agree.
[00:42:46.275 --> 00:42:48.658]  One of these people hits me, they're gonna get it back.
[00:42:49.239 --> 00:42:50.561]  And I'm afraid of what I'm gonna do to them.
[00:42:50.581 --> 00:42:55.888]  We'll be right back with Gavin McInnes from CRTV.com and on Twitter, Gavin underscore McInnes.
[00:42:56.008 --> 00:42:56.429]  Stay with us.
[00:43:00.595 --> 00:43:01.516]  We knew it was coming.
[00:43:01.536 --> 00:43:03.077]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:43:03.418 --> 00:43:16.649]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:43:19.497 --> 00:43:29.604]  Two weeks later, banned InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top 5 or top 10 news feeds.
[00:43:30.204 --> 00:43:49.097]  And so their answer is, have CNN, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and all these other corrupt organizations openly lobby for us to be removed and then organize their listeners, their viewers, the different university organizations, Antifa, sleeping giants, and a bunch of other groups
[00:43:50.118 --> 00:44:00.546]  To then go mass flag us in the community guidelines, which again is something out of 1984 or a Kafka novel, where you don't even know what you've supposedly done.
[00:44:00.566 --> 00:44:02.047]  You can't face your accuser.
[00:44:02.067 --> 00:44:07.632]  Then you get defamed by the claims of the big tech giants when they ban you.
[00:44:08.752 --> 00:44:22.444]  Make no mistake, this is being set up to create a precedent in their own words for you, nationalists, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, people that stand up to the New York Times editorial board member saying whites are subhuman and should be extincted.
[00:44:23.244 --> 00:44:27.728]  This is the agenda they're pushing that is being funded by Communist China.
[00:44:28.409 --> 00:44:31.031]  Out of everything I've broken down so far, that's the key.
[00:44:31.431 --> 00:44:35.155]  Apple has officially moved to China and is letting the government basically run Apple.
[00:44:36.346 --> 00:44:37.227]  That, of course, is iTunes.
[00:44:37.647 --> 00:44:44.312]  Google is building a huge censorship search engine for them, and whistleblowers from inside Google say they're preparing to use it here in America.
[00:44:45.353 --> 00:44:52.779]  In fact, they're beta testing different parts of the censorship system for China on American conservatives, nationalists, and Trump supporters.
[00:44:53.359 --> 00:44:58.903]  The bigger issue is, they don't like InfoWars exposing the fact in great detail.
[00:44:59.884 --> 00:45:12.349]  The Communist China owns our debt, owns and controls Hollywood now, is involved in massive domestic propaganda operations, and is working with the Democratic Party and with the EU and others to try to block the Trump agenda.
[00:45:12.649 --> 00:45:14.249]  They even talk about this at Davos.
[00:45:14.329 --> 00:45:16.650]  So this is 21st century warfare.
[00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:26.374]  It's happening right now, and it's designed to silence the American people and other populist movements around the world who are trying to struggle free from this corporate totalitarianism.
[00:45:26.894 --> 00:45:31.796]  This now becomes the last battle of the Civil War.
[00:45:31.956 --> 00:45:37.518]  You know, Fox, Breitbart, Sinclair, and Alex Jones, which has now been taken off of Facebook, thank God.
[00:45:38.098 --> 00:45:43.961]  The number one thing you can do past standing up to this and getting informed and informing others is to simply...
[00:45:44.841 --> 00:45:47.422]  Go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:45:47.842 --> 00:45:49.283]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[00:45:49.723 --> 00:45:50.543]  Just click on the link.
[00:45:50.764 --> 00:45:53.725]  Whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[00:45:54.405 --> 00:46:05.790]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform that are being censored so you can get them out to others.
[00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:10.232]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:46:10.732 --> 00:46:13.593]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[00:46:14.133 --> 00:46:19.015]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:20.555]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:46:20.955 --> 00:46:21.596]  You're an adult.
[00:46:21.916 --> 00:46:23.936]  You deserve to hear what all the hubbub's about.
[00:46:24.257 --> 00:46:28.878]  You deserve to hear what the establishment is so desperate to silence so you can make your own decision.
[00:46:29.658 --> 00:46:30.759]  Infowars.com.
[00:46:31.019 --> 00:46:31.899]  Newswars.com.
[00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:33.200]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:33.760]  Listen.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.222]  I was never trying to win a popularity contest.
[00:46:36.362 --> 00:46:40.245]  I've been trying to get Americans and others to think outside the box and realize what's happening.
[00:46:40.265 --> 00:46:41.046]  We've been very successful.
[00:46:41.506 --> 00:46:42.687]  I've expected to be attacked.
[00:46:42.707 --> 00:46:46.151]  I didn't know we'd be the very tip of the spear, but it's happened.
[00:46:46.611 --> 00:46:51.455]  So now, Infowars is the banner of free speech, the renaissance in Western culture and civilization.
[00:46:51.776 --> 00:46:59.723]  And it's more important than ever that folks realize that the dominoes are beginning to fall against your cherished free speech, and you'll lose everything else if you don't stand up for it now.
[00:47:04.139 --> 00:47:15.062]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.462 --> 00:47:25.265]  You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[00:47:26.925 --> 00:47:31.987]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:36.891 --> 00:47:43.095]  I can now announce, it's true, at the first of the show I said we were number one on trending and number three on overall news apps.
[00:47:43.355 --> 00:47:46.918]  We're now number one on the Android and number one on Apple.
[00:47:47.338 --> 00:47:48.239]  So that just happened.
[00:47:48.279 --> 00:47:53.562]  We are number one against apps that have been up there for years like the Huffington Post and CNN.
[00:47:53.842 --> 00:47:55.924]  They are flipping out.
[00:47:56.764 --> 00:48:09.315]  And just this morning I saw three reports, I couldn't even watch them all, but articles on CNN saying ban Alex Jones off of iTunes apps and off of Android.
[00:48:10.096 --> 00:48:15.801]  Gavin, I hate to make this about me, but this is getting absolutely, totally insane.
[00:48:15.921 --> 00:48:19.183]  I launched an app three weeks ago, figuring all this was coming up a new one.
[00:48:19.924 --> 00:48:25.129]  This happens, and it has got 4.9 stars.
[00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:30.214]  They are... I gotta tell you, I think they jumped the shark.
[00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:37.001]  Like the NFL taking a knee and losing 40% of their viewers, or Hollywood losing 35% of their revenue, you know, going on against Trump.
[00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:39.063]  I mean, but like you said, they're destroying themselves.
[00:48:39.303 --> 00:48:40.144]  They can't stop.
[00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:41.005]  Where does this go?
[00:48:42.267 --> 00:48:46.469]  Well, it goes with starvation, with information starvation.
[00:48:46.529 --> 00:48:49.990]  It goes with a socialist country that starts to eat itself.
[00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:51.410]  Like we're seeing this in Canada.
[00:48:51.771 --> 00:48:53.351]  We're seeing, we saw this in Britain.
[00:48:53.771 --> 00:48:59.033]  You know, they open the borders to mass immigration and they say, replace this population.
[00:48:59.093 --> 00:49:01.074]  I want people who owe me one.
[00:49:01.494 --> 00:49:03.816]  And then I see, you know, the country's gone, you know.
[00:49:04.096 --> 00:49:08.599]  And this is very unique to America, this whole idea of different voices.
[00:49:08.939 --> 00:49:13.603]  The Brits actually started it by encouraging all these different newspapers down the East Coast.
[00:49:13.903 --> 00:49:16.945]  And there was, they said, make it right-wing, make it left-wing, have debates.
[00:49:17.265 --> 00:49:19.727]  And the next thing you know, we go, this is fun!
[00:49:20.067 --> 00:49:21.248]  This is colorful!
[00:49:21.528 --> 00:49:22.789]  This is interesting!
[00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:24.791]  This is humorous!
[00:49:24.851 --> 00:49:28.133]  That we're using sarcasm and irony, and I'm enjoying myself!
[00:49:28.493 --> 00:49:31.657]  Let's start a whole country on this and kick the British out.
[00:49:32.257 --> 00:49:38.845]  And they did and now we're getting back to this monarchy mentality where we can't have conspiracy theories.
[00:49:39.145 --> 00:49:43.050]  What the hell is the matter with a conspiracy theory?
[00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.572]  That's called a theory about someone conspiring.
[00:49:46.852 --> 00:49:52.395]  And you had a bunch of conspiracy theories about how the government was going to try to de-platform you.
[00:49:52.776 --> 00:49:54.777]  Turns out that's not a theory anymore.
[00:49:55.297 --> 00:49:55.977]  It's a fact.
[00:49:56.017 --> 00:49:59.419]  This is like a war on curiosity, fun, humor.
[00:49:59.539 --> 00:50:00.800]  It's a war on color.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.322]  It's a war on what makes America great.
[00:50:04.002 --> 00:50:04.503]  Well, you're right.
[00:50:05.344 --> 00:50:08.387]  I kind of self-censored myself Sunday morning.
[00:50:08.447 --> 00:50:08.908]  I get up.
[00:50:09.548 --> 00:50:11.651]  They say a drone has shot missiles at Maduro.
[00:50:12.071 --> 00:50:12.872]  I watch all the footage.
[00:50:12.912 --> 00:50:14.113]  I go, it's probably a false flag.
[00:50:14.374 --> 00:50:15.115]  He's a dictator.
[00:50:15.135 --> 00:50:16.236]  He's teetering on collapse.
[00:50:16.636 --> 00:50:20.941]  Brazil's have to close its border because millions are trying to flee, just like we're having to.
[00:50:21.221 --> 00:50:22.363]  Oh, but they're not racist when they do.
[00:50:24.665 --> 00:50:25.546]  I didn't do anything on it.
[00:50:26.046 --> 00:50:32.990]  And then suddenly I read the mainstream news, they go, the US government thinks he staged it or it didn't even happen, or a gas main blew up and a building crossed the street.
[00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:35.992]  The point is, known liars, you don't believe them, you question them.
[00:50:36.212 --> 00:50:38.814]  It doesn't mean that you're sure it didn't happen or did.
[00:50:38.874 --> 00:50:42.316]  You have a right to question known liars, and that's the point.
[00:50:42.336 --> 00:50:43.517]  But what about the fact that
[00:50:43.837 --> 00:50:53.611]  Four million people have already fled Venezuela in the last six months, and now millions are trying like zombie apocalypse to flee socialism into Brazil that has its own problems.
[00:50:53.892 --> 00:50:58.038]  Brazil's going the way of Trump in their election, so they're trying to ban free speech.
[00:50:58.358 --> 00:50:59.260]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:51:00.734 --> 00:51:02.575]  Yeah, it's a disturbing pattern.
[00:51:02.615 --> 00:51:04.855]  And you know what they say the left says to that, right?
[00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:11.658]  They go, no, no, no, no, Venezuela, Cuba, Russia, China, Cambodia, North Korea.
[00:51:12.058 --> 00:51:14.379]  None of that is the kind of socialism I want.
[00:51:14.979 --> 00:51:15.539]  I want
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.361]  Uh, Finland.
[00:51:17.461 --> 00:51:18.462]  I want Norway.
[00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:20.024]  I want all these Northern European countries.
[00:51:20.064 --> 00:51:21.946]  And you go, they're on the way down.
[00:51:22.267 --> 00:51:28.974]  They're using the money they had when they were free market, and they're literally spending their grandparents' and their parents' money.
[00:51:29.374 --> 00:51:31.637]  So that's not a model we want to mimic.
[00:51:32.857 --> 00:51:44.360]  And this whole idea of socialism being the future of the Democratic Party, which many Democratic politicians will proudly say, is the end of America.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:55.363]  And the thing that scares me about that is, they don't just want to change America, like the classical liberals wanted to alter some bad things, and I think they were wrong, but at least they had a plan.
[00:51:55.703 --> 00:51:57.445]  This is just, let's burn it to the ground.
[00:51:57.765 --> 00:51:58.646]  They don't want to debate.
[00:51:58.786 --> 00:52:00.087]  They don't want the truth to come out.
[00:52:00.427 --> 00:52:06.553]  They don't want to, you know, get to something that's more a meritocracy.
[00:52:06.913 --> 00:52:08.254]  They just want to destroy everything.
[00:52:08.274 --> 00:52:09.175]  They want to burn your house.
[00:52:09.215 --> 00:52:11.237]  And if they die too, that's fine.
[00:52:11.497 --> 00:52:12.077]  They don't care.
[00:52:12.118 --> 00:52:15.861]  Like Bill Maher says, let's destroy the economy so we can get rid of Trump.
[00:52:17.213 --> 00:52:17.593]  That's right.
[00:52:17.613 --> 00:52:18.893]  Gavin, let me ask you this question.
[00:52:19.294 --> 00:52:23.995]  Alexandria Cortez, everyone she endorsed, lost in primaries to other Democrats.
[00:52:24.435 --> 00:52:27.556]  All the Democrats so far have lost in these special elections last night.
[00:52:28.336 --> 00:52:35.858]  I think this is going to send them into even more shrill, like you said, obsessed crazy old girlfriend, fatal attraction mode.
[00:52:36.979 --> 00:52:38.019]  Yeah, it really is.
[00:52:38.759 --> 00:52:41.560]  And the other thing they don't get is that no one agrees with them.
[00:52:42.117 --> 00:52:46.780]  Millennials love socialism because they never got a paycheck and they didn't see how much to take out.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.282]  Remember your first paycheck when you're working at the gas station and you get it back and you go, what?
[00:52:51.882 --> 00:52:54.404]  They're taking that much out of every single check?
[00:52:54.864 --> 00:52:55.764]  Where's it going?
[00:52:56.005 --> 00:52:58.606]  And you're in the lowest tax bracket and they're taking a third out of it.
[00:52:59.972 --> 00:53:00.272]  Yes!
[00:53:00.672 --> 00:53:06.995]  Yeah, the amount of tax I pay has been going up every year my entire life, and I can't take it anymore.
[00:53:07.095 --> 00:53:07.635]  I'm mad.
[00:53:07.755 --> 00:53:13.237]  I've gone to big tax lawyers and top ones, and they go, listen, Alex, you know the amount of money you have isn't that much anyways.
[00:53:13.277 --> 00:53:14.497]  You can't do stuff offshore.
[00:53:14.857 --> 00:53:16.118]  All the big boys are allowed to.
[00:53:16.178 --> 00:53:21.380]  All the elites go to the special law firms that are run by former attorney generals, and then they all pay zero tax.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:26.522]  That's part of the elite club, and they all go offshore, like Bezos and Tim Cook.
[00:53:27.002 --> 00:53:32.264]  These people admittedly almost pay no taxes, but they lobby all day to raise taxes on people like you and me.
[00:53:32.524 --> 00:53:35.245]  You actually try to open a company, have a restaurant, a car dealership.
[00:53:35.485 --> 00:53:37.105]  You got 50, 60, 70 employees.
[00:53:37.406 --> 00:53:40.847]  The way they do all the stuff now, getting rid of the loopholes, I pay...
[00:53:41.927 --> 00:53:42.507]  Federally, 50%.
[00:53:43.108 --> 00:53:49.311]  So I'm trying to bring all this money in constantly, you know, and they're calling it profit when I'm buying infrastructure.
[00:53:49.531 --> 00:53:50.551]  It's total screwjob.
[00:53:51.071 --> 00:53:51.612]  People don't know.
[00:53:52.132 --> 00:53:53.673]  And America knows that.
[00:53:53.973 --> 00:53:58.955]  Middle America flyover states everywhere outside of New York and LA and we just saw in Ohio.
[00:53:59.435 --> 00:54:03.938]  Middle America understands that jobs are really the only thing that matters.
[00:54:04.318 --> 00:54:06.099]  And Trump is providing jobs.
[00:54:07.259 --> 00:54:14.709]  They're scared, because they're scared that you and I and Trump are making the right seem a lot more attractive, a lot more fun.
[00:54:14.969 --> 00:54:20.076]  We have more millennials identifying as right-wing than ever before, or at least not since the early 80s.
[00:54:20.236 --> 00:54:22.199]  And Generation Z. That was my next question.
[00:54:22.599 --> 00:54:25.463]  You're proud boys, great patriots, they call them white supremacists.
[00:54:25.963 --> 00:54:29.064]  About a third of them are big, handsome black guys and Hispanic folks.
[00:54:29.564 --> 00:54:36.147]  But what was going on, like the poor little Hispanic guy who has a neurological disorder, they beat him up in Berkeley.
[00:54:36.167 --> 00:54:38.508]  He's fought back and kicked their ass, even though he's on a walker.
[00:54:38.928 --> 00:54:40.649]  I mean, these are the images they can't stand.
[00:54:40.689 --> 00:54:46.391]  And those are all the videos, I think, were the last straw that had millions of views despite their shadow ban on our Facebook.
[00:54:47.131 --> 00:54:48.292]  And our YouTube fan pages.
[00:54:48.632 --> 00:54:55.218]  So they panicked when we had four reporters covering the event in Portland, the event in Berkeley, where thousands showed up.
[00:54:55.978 --> 00:54:57.279]  Only Antifa got arrested.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.520]  They were such scum.
[00:54:58.601 --> 00:55:08.949]  And when your crowd, and the prayer vigil crowd, was more diverse, probably about demographically, was more diverse, 15% black, about 20-30% Hispanic,
[00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:12.452]  And they were all hugging each other and loving each other.
[00:55:12.472 --> 00:55:14.753]  This, I think, sent them into conniption.
[00:55:14.793 --> 00:55:15.494]  The polls show it.
[00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:22.079]  Double the number of Hispanics and African Americans are supporting Trump and Republicans than they were just six months ago.
[00:55:22.359 --> 00:55:23.460]  This is a landslide.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.541]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[00:55:25.802 --> 00:55:28.744]  Yeah, they hate that their pet blacks have left the plantation.
[00:55:29.104 --> 00:55:34.328]  And you'll notice they don't talk about David Duke or Richard Spencer or avowed white nationalists.
[00:55:34.668 --> 00:55:41.633]  They throw that around at people like you and me because they know it's not true and they have to do something to sink us.
[00:55:41.914 --> 00:55:44.295]  Because they know we have this massive appeal.
[00:55:44.595 --> 00:55:45.456]  They know we're funny.
[00:55:45.736 --> 00:55:49.359]  They know when you have the tinfoil hat on your head, you're being hilarious.
[00:55:49.739 --> 00:55:54.703]  But they go, I can't show that, I have to push the big lie and get these people out.
[00:55:54.943 --> 00:55:57.746]  Like, you know what's a great example of all this bullshit propaganda?
[00:55:57.786 --> 00:55:58.486]  Excuse my language.
[00:55:58.867 --> 00:55:59.867]  Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:56:00.308 --> 00:56:04.231]  He has 0% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 90%
[00:56:05.852 --> 00:56:06.473]  Audience rating.
[00:56:06.513 --> 00:56:10.497]  I mean, doesn't that sum up the massive agenda the left has?
[00:56:10.517 --> 00:56:11.158]  Say that again.
[00:56:11.418 --> 00:56:11.958]  Say that again.
[00:56:12.219 --> 00:56:17.504]  The little imperiums, you know, who give fake ratings to whoever pays them, that's well known, for terrible movies.
[00:56:18.064 --> 00:56:24.290]  The establishment has a total negative rating for D'Souza's amazing film, but the public's 90%.
[00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:25.952]  It shows the fraud.
[00:56:27.105 --> 00:56:31.549]  It's a massive, giant gap, and Charles Murray talked about this in Coming Apart.
[00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:41.499]  We have a massive gap now between the elites and the Midwest, and at least, you know, at least the monocle-wearing elites of the past, they knew they were distant.
[00:56:41.519 --> 00:56:46.063]  They had their top hats, and they had their scented handkerchiefs they put on their face when they walked by the port.
[00:56:46.444 --> 00:56:49.627]  These dummies, these rich elites at CNN and The Globalist,
[00:56:49.967 --> 00:56:55.632]  They actually think they understand Middle America and they are in touch with what we want.
[00:56:55.992 --> 00:56:56.252]  No!
[00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:58.274]  We don't think of speech as terror.
[00:56:58.574 --> 00:56:59.375]  We don't care!
[00:56:59.395 --> 00:57:03.838]  You talk about hate speech like they say, free speech is good, but it doesn't include hate speech.
[00:57:03.958 --> 00:57:05.239]  It includes everything, dummy.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.701]  We don't want rules, we want total freedom.
[00:57:07.802 --> 00:57:13.046]  And the more you push these rules and regulations, the more you ostracize young people.
[00:57:13.066 --> 00:57:15.728]  And a great example is what just happened in Infowars.
[00:57:15.948 --> 00:57:22.054]  Number one app, period, in news on both Apple and Android, and CNN is freaking out saying remove us.
[00:57:22.435 --> 00:57:23.716]  How obvious is that?
[00:57:23.736 --> 00:57:25.378]  We'll be back in five more minutes with Gavin McGinnis.
[00:57:25.398 --> 00:57:26.819]  We have other special guests joining us.
[00:57:26.839 --> 00:57:28.281]  He's the host of Get Off My Lawn.
[00:57:28.341 --> 00:57:28.801]  It's great.
[00:57:28.841 --> 00:57:29.622]  My son watches it.
[00:57:29.962 --> 00:57:32.565]  His whole school watches it, which scares the hell out of the left.
[00:57:32.605 --> 00:57:34.207]  I mean, took my daughters to camp this year.
[00:57:35.188 --> 00:57:41.073]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:57:41.093 --> 00:57:42.734]  It's you that has defeated Hillary.
[00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:07.089]  I don't know.
[00:58:24.475 --> 00:58:36.060]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:46.025]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[00:58:46.525 --> 00:58:46.805]  I don't
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.402]  We're following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country.
[00:59:09.782 --> 00:59:11.864]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:59:12.324 --> 00:59:17.267]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is or what sex we are, where we came from.
[00:59:17.847 --> 00:59:25.492]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:25.992 --> 00:59:32.717]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:33.057 --> 00:59:34.418]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[00:59:34.818 --> 00:59:36.359]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.201]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[00:59:38.861 --> 00:59:40.502]  And many others are across the world.
[00:59:40.763 --> 00:59:41.543]  We are the future.
[00:59:42.464 --> 00:59:43.405]  We are the renaissance.
[00:59:43.965 --> 00:59:45.226]  And we are winning.
[00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:57.996]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:16.243 --> 01:00:19.964]  Gavin McGinnis, love him on CRTV and the great work he does on Get Off My Lawn.
[01:00:20.144 --> 01:00:21.084]  It's on his show yesterday.
[01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:24.625]  All the great work they're doing over there and just all the talent they've got is amazing.
[01:00:24.645 --> 01:00:31.087]  Makes me feel good to know there's other good people out there like DrudgeReport.com and Dr. Savage had me on yesterday and defended First Amendment.
[01:00:31.647 --> 01:00:38.508]  But since we mentioned this, let's play Candace Owens and her sidekick there from the great folks at Turning Point USA.
[01:00:38.929 --> 01:00:39.869]  And they're just having
[01:00:40.689 --> 01:00:42.510]  Food and Cafe in Philadelphia after giving a speech.
[01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:46.611]  And this is what little white twits do to feel good.
[01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:49.172]  They found Nazi sympathizers.
[01:00:49.472 --> 01:00:50.753]  They're like the French Resistance.
[01:00:50.893 --> 01:00:51.633]  And so they're going to get them.
[01:00:51.653 --> 01:00:51.953]  Here it is.
[01:00:52.713 --> 01:00:56.595]  We're eating breakfast and we have to be conservative.
[01:00:56.675 --> 01:00:58.515]  They're not Nazis.
[01:00:58.555 --> 01:00:59.916]  They're soft fascists.
[01:00:59.976 --> 01:01:01.096]  They're the soft fascists.
[01:01:01.176 --> 01:01:02.377]  They're not Nazis.
[01:01:02.877 --> 01:01:03.797]  Have a wonderful day.
[01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:05.498]  Enjoy your capitalist breakfast.
[01:01:07.995 --> 01:01:09.476]  Are you filming?
[01:01:09.677 --> 01:01:10.477]  So, ready?
[01:01:10.497 --> 01:01:10.477]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6!
[01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.572]  Big government sucks?
[01:01:26.792 --> 01:01:31.556]  That's what your phone fucking says?
[01:01:32.296 --> 01:01:34.898]  Big government sucks?
[01:01:34.978 --> 01:01:38.961]  Wait, what sucks about big government?
[01:01:39.021 --> 01:01:40.602]  Let's talk about that one.
[01:01:40.642 --> 01:01:42.363]  What sucks about big government?
[01:01:42.524 --> 01:01:48.408]  Is it the fact that y'all are part of big government?
[01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:57.134]  If you're a radio listener, which I always have to remember, we're mainly radio, and they're trying to censor us.
[01:01:57.154 --> 01:01:59.176]  The radio is like the real power of this broadcast.
[01:01:59.196 --> 01:01:59.816]  It's still there.
[01:01:59.836 --> 01:02:00.337]  It's wonderful.
[01:02:00.357 --> 01:02:00.677]  It's big.
[01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:01.878]  Tell folks about stations.
[01:02:02.859 --> 01:02:11.045]  You've got a bunch of skinny Eugene people with their $800 iPhones sitting there having their coming-of-age thing, sticking megaphones in a black woman.
[01:02:11.345 --> 01:02:11.985]  A civil war?
[01:02:41.781 --> 01:02:42.141]  Riots.
[01:02:43.182 --> 01:02:45.062]  A giant Ferguson from coast to coast.
[01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:48.624]  Every major city on fire after the election.
[01:02:48.644 --> 01:02:50.984]  We've already seen traces of that.
[01:02:51.265 --> 01:02:52.125]  That's right.
[01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:55.526]  You think when we win these midterms they're going to go ape?
[01:02:56.466 --> 01:02:56.987]  Without a doubt.
[01:02:57.227 --> 01:02:57.747]  Without a doubt.
[01:02:58.303 --> 01:03:00.524]  Listen to them, F the bourgeoisie, too.
[01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:03.066]  You know who's to blame for all of this brainwashing?
[01:03:03.186 --> 01:03:04.286]  It's academia.
[01:03:04.706 --> 01:03:10.750]  These kids get pushed Marxism from kindergarten up, but when they hit college, it goes full bore.
[01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:23.196]  And I was talking to Michael Recktenwald, who is called anti-PC professor, and he's suing NYU right now, and he was telling me that the first year when they start out, there is a bit of variety.
[01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:23.716]  There's like 50-50.
[01:03:25.538 --> 01:03:26.960]  Right, left, kind of Marxist.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.005]  And then year two, you start seeing it's 70-30.
[01:03:30.505 --> 01:03:36.475]  By the end of it, there's only maybe 5-10% would dare stray from the far left orthodoxy.
[01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:50.627]  And within that 95% that is far left, there are half of them extreme, full-on communist radicals that want to burn mansions to the ground and take over the country.
[01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:54.030]  They don't talk about socialism, these kids.
[01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:57.294]  They have a quote, they say, full communism.
[01:03:57.774 --> 01:03:59.596]  By the way, I want to get that professor on.
[01:03:59.616 --> 01:04:02.718]  He's the one that talks about, leftists don't lecture me about how you're hiding money.
[01:04:02.879 --> 01:04:04.100]  You're the biggest killers in history.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.182]  I want to get him on because we've got to launch a counteroffensive.
[01:04:07.242 --> 01:04:09.264]  This is the counteroffensive.
[01:04:10.365 --> 01:04:14.929]  I just hope Trump gets really, really pushy here because when he said something to Twitter, they backed off.
[01:04:14.969 --> 01:04:15.970]  He needs to say it to Google.
[01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:17.351]  He needs to say it to everybody else.
[01:04:17.391 --> 01:04:18.292]  I've got to report to him.
[01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:25.118]  Don't you agree that we have to get the Republican Congress and everybody right now to make this a campaign issue and tell the tech giant, stop it now.
[01:04:26.246 --> 01:04:28.167]  Yes, there is collusion going on here.
[01:04:28.507 --> 01:04:33.230]  But it's not Russia, it's big tech and big business and the government.
[01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:35.651]  So the government has to undo this.
[01:04:35.712 --> 01:04:38.173]  I mean, this is corruption from top to bottom.
[01:04:38.193 --> 01:04:45.217]  And they have to say, we don't let big business and big government work together because that's called fascism.
[01:04:45.297 --> 01:04:45.637]  It is.
[01:04:45.677 --> 01:04:47.198]  Gavin McGinnis, you're on fire.
[01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:49.620]  Great work there with Get Off My Lawn at CRTV.
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:54.462]  We got some of your boys coming on, Rufio Panman coming up and Will Johnson straight ahead.
[01:04:54.502 --> 01:04:55.423]  Thank you so much, Gavin.
[01:04:56.212 --> 01:04:56.793]  Thanks for having me.
[01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:57.875]  That was good.
[01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:58.396]  We'll be back.
[01:05:01.058 --> 01:05:01.759]  I want to-
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.061]  Hey, have you heard?
[01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:38.602]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[01:05:38.682 --> 01:05:39.983]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[01:05:40.183 --> 01:05:41.204]  They're all censoring us.
[01:05:41.564 --> 01:05:47.467]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[01:05:47.767 --> 01:05:50.789]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[01:06:05.242 --> 01:06:09.250]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:15.742]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:06:23.337 --> 01:06:31.906]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:32.747 --> 01:06:35.771]  You know, the communists have taken the symbol in the last 150 years, the clenched fist.
[01:06:35.831 --> 01:06:37.072]  Now, that's our symbol.
[01:06:38.414 --> 01:06:43.920]  We're not looking for a fight, but if you came to want to have one, you're going to get one politically, economically, and physically.
[01:06:44.844 --> 01:06:46.184]  We don't start fights, but we finish them.
[01:06:46.305 --> 01:06:49.286]  And I gotta tell you, beautiful things are happening right now.
[01:06:50.046 --> 01:06:51.486]  And I expected to be attacked.
[01:06:51.546 --> 01:06:52.527]  I expected to be banned.
[01:06:52.567 --> 01:06:55.448]  I saw them softening me up, getting me ready as the beta test.
[01:06:55.488 --> 01:06:57.549]  I'm not important enough to have a thousand articles a day.
[01:06:59.269 --> 01:07:01.870]  On average, the last year and a half, lying about me and my family.
[01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:03.571]  And I've been trying to destroy my life.
[01:07:03.691 --> 01:07:06.632]  New York Times reporters stalking me for years on end.
[01:07:06.692 --> 01:07:08.513]  BuzzFeed, Soros people.
[01:07:08.573 --> 01:07:09.433]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:07:10.598 --> 01:07:13.401]  I don't get into all this because it's James Bondy and it's crazy.
[01:07:13.522 --> 01:07:14.463]  And it doesn't intimidate me.
[01:07:14.483 --> 01:07:15.484]  It actually gives me energy.
[01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.868]  Because I realize if we lose, they win.
[01:07:19.288 --> 01:07:21.311]  And so it's not like I have a death wish or something.
[01:07:22.332 --> 01:07:22.953]  It's the opposite.
[01:07:23.113 --> 01:07:26.397]  The death wish would be if I wanted them to control things and run things.
[01:07:27.037 --> 01:07:27.899]  It'd be like giving up.
[01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:31.711]  And my soul only feels good when I'm opposing these people.
[01:07:31.731 --> 01:07:38.295]  And let me tell you, my soul feels good when we've got folks like Will Johnson of UnitedAmericaFirst.com.
[01:07:39.135 --> 01:07:49.241]  And I sat there for hours on Saturday and hours on Sunday hearing him speak in the live feeds and then doing these big feeds we did here before we were banned on Facebook and everywhere.
[01:07:50.181 --> 01:07:53.303]  It turned out hundreds of thousands watching live and millions watched it total.
[01:07:54.543 --> 01:07:57.265]  Of him and Owen Schroyer and the rest of the great patriots,
[01:07:58.732 --> 01:08:22.683]  Out there just in a love fest for freedom, for free speech, 20 plus antifa arrested for crimes, no patriots arrested, and seeing, you know, Hispanic and black and white and Asian Americans and women all together loving America and articulate and, you know, even if somebody had muscle dystrophy and he was on a walker and got beat up by a little Hispanic guy who fought back, he was a beautiful person.
[01:08:23.618 --> 01:08:25.942]  And just the light in their eyes, they're so alive.
[01:08:26.002 --> 01:08:33.115]  And let me tell you something, the Antifa and the left, I knew, I said Sunday, I looked at Rob Dillon and I said, they're gonna ban us for this.
[01:08:33.135 --> 01:08:34.056]  And he goes, what do you mean?
[01:08:35.357 --> 01:08:36.638]  I said, this is just too good.
[01:08:37.558 --> 01:08:41.640]  I mean, the nastiness of the other side, and this, and the fact that they can't shut us down.
[01:08:42.121 --> 01:08:47.763]  And I said, the Republicans are going to win these special elections next Tuesday, but it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:08:48.144 --> 01:08:55.707]  And when they saw all those diverse people, but unified by America and freedom and Christianity and the light in their eyes, they crapped a brick.
[01:08:56.228 --> 01:08:58.949]  And so people are like, oh, you're getting persecuted, you're getting kicked off everything.
[01:09:00.157 --> 01:09:04.999]  I have faith in God, but I've been fired before when I wouldn't sell out and wouldn't lie.
[01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:10.242]  So, selling my soul out ain't happening.
[01:09:10.862 --> 01:09:12.783]  When my soul feels good about something, I follow that.
[01:09:13.507 --> 01:09:14.888]  When it feels bad, I get away from it.
[01:09:15.508 --> 01:09:17.349]  And I feel good doing this.
[01:09:17.409 --> 01:09:19.471]  And watching Will Johnson and others made me feel so good.
[01:09:19.951 --> 01:09:22.713]  And then when they've done all this and lied about me, I mean, they follow me.
[01:09:22.773 --> 01:09:23.994]  When I leave here, I'll be followed.
[01:09:24.034 --> 01:09:24.874]  I'm stalked constantly.
[01:09:25.174 --> 01:09:28.837]  Just want you to know, we're dealing with criminals who have a will to dominate us.
[01:09:28.857 --> 01:09:30.238]  They lust after running our lives.
[01:09:30.558 --> 01:09:34.340]  Real men and women who love God and have their own lives, they don't want to run their own lives.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.881]  I mean, they don't want to run your life.
[01:09:35.901 --> 01:09:36.862]  They're busy with their own lives.
[01:09:38.171 --> 01:09:40.793]  So Will Johnson, I want to salute you while all this is happening.
[01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:44.917]  I just got to say, great job on your take on what's happening, what happened this weekend.
[01:09:44.937 --> 01:09:46.318]  You know, we've got the crew back.
[01:09:46.338 --> 01:09:47.859]  We're uploading HD videos to Twitter.
[01:09:48.159 --> 01:09:53.644]  We're going to start up every day saying theinfowars.com censored video list on our own server on InfoWars.
[01:09:53.704 --> 01:09:54.465]  Everybody can grab it.
[01:09:54.505 --> 01:09:56.206]  It's free to air, copyright free.
[01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:57.287]  There'll be a message at the end.
[01:09:57.647 --> 01:09:59.289]  This is free to use, whoever you are.
[01:10:00.559 --> 01:10:02.640]  And Rufio, we're getting Rufio on here in a minute.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:09.702]  As well, we just got him lined up for this segment, and the next, and then a little bit more into the next, or hopefully the whole hour.
[01:10:10.042 --> 01:10:11.903]  Rufio, obviously, out there.
[01:10:11.923 --> 01:10:14.283]  When they attack him, he just with precision takes them out.
[01:10:14.883 --> 01:10:21.946]  But this point we're at, where we launched the app three weeks ago, InfoWars Official, and it went to the top 40 in the first two weeks.
[01:10:22.426 --> 01:10:23.186]  So we have a big audience.
[01:10:23.526 --> 01:10:25.967]  It went to number one in news today.
[01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:29.109]  And what is CNN doing saying, ban him, ban him?
[01:10:29.509 --> 01:10:31.591]  How villainous can it get?
[01:10:33.252 --> 01:10:42.418]  Here, Will Johnson of UnitedAmericanFirst.com and of course, Rufio Panman, we're going to next with you, Rufio Panman on Twitter for now.
[01:10:42.919 --> 01:10:45.841]  What do you make of this historic time we're in, my brother?
[01:10:47.222 --> 01:10:48.423]  I think we are winning.
[01:10:49.059 --> 01:10:55.720]  And see, I think that's the main reason why they want to shut you down as much as possible, because we are winning.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:05.602]  They know for a fact that because we exposed Antifa and the left for the hateful stuff that they were doing, that they knew you would be talking about it.
[01:11:05.802 --> 01:11:15.364]  See, the mainstream media, they're not saying anything about it because there were no people that are Trump supporters, patriots, that were arrested, that were causing any violence.
[01:11:15.684 --> 01:11:17.704]  So we couldn't give them anything that they wanted.
[01:11:18.145 --> 01:11:20.652]  So they knew that you would expose the truth.
[01:11:20.893 --> 01:11:23.982]  So they want to shut you down because they know so many people.
[01:11:26.419 --> 01:11:29.240]  So they had to do everything they can to shut it down.
[01:11:29.681 --> 01:11:32.502]  But see, I personally, I think it's going to backfire on them.
[01:11:33.062 --> 01:11:41.445]  So many people are waking up to what they did to Infowars, to Alex Jones, that is going to, it's waking people up like never before.
[01:11:42.305 --> 01:11:44.706]  And it's going to just bring a storm to them.
[01:11:45.166 --> 01:11:46.627]  I've talked to multiple people.
[01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:51.489]  They say, you know, I really don't agree with Alex Jones on everything that he says, but them,
[01:11:52.429 --> 01:11:59.858]  BANNING HIM THE WAY THAT THEY DID WAS COMPLETELY, ULTIMATELY OUT OF PLACE.
[01:12:00.719 --> 01:12:02.641]  AND THEY SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT?
[01:12:02.822 --> 01:12:03.502]  THEY'RE PICKING UP.
[01:12:03.543 --> 01:12:04.404]  THEY WENT TO THE APP.
[01:12:04.424 --> 01:12:07.027]  THEY SAID, I'M GOING TO GET THE APP BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
[01:12:07.896 --> 01:12:09.537]  Multiple people said, Willie, have you got the app?
[01:12:09.557 --> 01:12:10.277]  Have you got the app?
[01:12:10.297 --> 01:12:12.058]  I said, yes, of course I have the app.
[01:12:12.678 --> 01:12:17.820]  But so many people, they said what they're doing to InfoWars is just taking it to another level.
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.681]  And it's beyond belief.
[01:12:20.161 --> 01:12:21.701]  It's like living in Nazi Germany.
[01:12:21.761 --> 01:12:25.603]  They are literally doing book burning with digital books.
[01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:32.485]  And InfoWars is their pilot program to see if they can do it to shut people up and see how many people are going to cry about it.
[01:12:33.406 --> 01:12:34.086]  I agree with you.
[01:12:34.666 --> 01:12:35.947]  And my concern is
[01:12:37.185 --> 01:12:43.789]  I literally got tears in my eyes watching these rallies and the police who'd been helping him in both places finally did the right thing.
[01:12:43.869 --> 01:12:46.331]  Arrested them, put their names out because they doxxed the police.
[01:12:46.631 --> 01:12:47.712]  Well, your name's going out there.
[01:12:48.192 --> 01:12:56.157]  And I think that also freaked them out that even in their blue city strongholds, where we know they've been ordered to help Antifa, the police are finally going, no, we're not doing it.
[01:12:57.941 --> 01:12:58.923]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:59.524 --> 01:13:02.028]  You know what, I have to give credit to the Portland Police.
[01:13:02.428 --> 01:13:07.677]  They did a phenomenal job by keeping the Antifa... No, I agree, but I'm saying the last two times they didn't.
[01:13:07.977 --> 01:13:09.880]  So I'm saying, exactly.
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:10.040]  Yes.
[01:13:11.644 --> 01:13:12.445]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:12.806 --> 01:13:14.548]  You know, and this time they did.
[01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:17.251]  But they wanted to come and harm us.
[01:13:17.632 --> 01:13:24.260]  You know, there was reports that they were actually shooting marbles over the police officers at us because they couldn't get to us.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.503]  So they kept going, kept going.
[01:13:26.563 --> 01:13:29.587]  And then all of a sudden, the police department started throwing flashbangs at them.
[01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:33.009]  Because they were getting so frustrated because they could not harm us.
[01:13:33.249 --> 01:13:48.140]  Have you ever noticed every time the left has a rally or a march or a gathering that you never ever hear about conservatives showing up throwing explosives at them, trying to hit them with rocks, trying to hit them with sticks, throwing bottles with urine and feces in it.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.521]  You never hear about it.
[01:13:49.761 --> 01:13:54.424]  It's only when we have a rally that these leftists show up to try to harm us.
[01:13:54.965 --> 01:13:56.145]  Where's the media on that?
[01:13:56.185 --> 01:13:58.187]  How come the media doesn't tell the truth on that?
[01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.807]  People should really ask that question.
[01:14:01.168 --> 01:14:03.028]  Why doesn't it happen that way?
[01:14:03.048 --> 01:14:04.768]  Then they always try to bring up Charlottesville.
[01:14:05.068 --> 01:14:06.169]  They always try to bring up Charlottesville.
[01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:09.789]  But even Charlottesville was not supposedly a leftist rally.
[01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.730]  You're right.
[01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:15.090]  We're going to go to Brighton and come back with you in a few minutes and with Rufio.
[01:14:16.471 --> 01:14:18.171]  We're confident, but I don't want to be too confident.
[01:14:18.671 --> 01:14:21.892]  You see stelters saying Trump's being violent to the media, saying they're liars.
[01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:25.439]  CNN's calling for all of us to be shut down.
[01:14:25.479 --> 01:14:26.580]  He's calling for no free speech.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.021]  He wants Infowars completely banned.
[01:14:28.461 --> 01:14:29.321]  All of them do at CNN.
[01:14:29.341 --> 01:14:32.003]  They want our app banned because they've been up for years.
[01:14:32.023 --> 01:14:33.804]  We already have more than them in three weeks.
[01:14:34.284 --> 01:14:35.545]  I mean, that's so ridiculous.
[01:14:35.565 --> 01:14:36.485]  They don't want us on the field.
[01:14:36.765 --> 01:14:38.006]  They don't want our race car on the track.
[01:14:38.286 --> 01:14:39.467]  They don't want us in the ring.
[01:14:39.527 --> 01:14:43.689]  They're archetypal criminal scumbag wimps.
[01:14:44.554 --> 01:14:56.722]  But they keep hyping that somebody's going to attack the media, somebody's going to attack the media, and I really think in my gut that's the only card they got left is to wind up some loon to attack them to make them the victims when they're the ones actually calling for violence.
[01:14:57.819 --> 01:15:00.342]  Right, they're screaming that someone's going to attack the media.
[01:15:00.822 --> 01:15:01.843]  Aren't they attacking you?
[01:15:02.544 --> 01:15:04.306]  Is this not an attack on Infowars?
[01:15:04.906 --> 01:15:06.027]  How is this not an attack?
[01:15:06.348 --> 01:15:07.529]  Calling me a Nazi?
[01:15:07.549 --> 01:15:08.650]  Calling me a Nazi?
[01:15:09.331 --> 01:15:12.574]  What are you saying that's so bad that they have to ban you?
[01:15:12.854 --> 01:15:15.777]  They're not saying anything that's not true.
[01:15:16.198 --> 01:15:17.499]  They are afraid of you.
[01:15:18.079 --> 01:15:22.623]  They're afraid of you because here it is, you're talking to a black male that has nothing against you.
[01:15:22.663 --> 01:15:23.723]  You have nothing against me.
[01:15:24.044 --> 01:15:25.164]  They don't want that narrative.
[01:15:25.204 --> 01:15:28.447]  They want you to be a white supremacist because you're not.
[01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:29.087]  Exactly.
[01:15:29.247 --> 01:15:31.789]  The leftists are all these Vanderbilts like Anderson Cooper.
[01:15:31.809 --> 01:15:33.050]  They're totally uncomfortable around everybody.
[01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:34.071]  We're just real people.
[01:15:34.271 --> 01:15:35.011]  The chemistry's there.
[01:15:35.131 --> 01:15:35.632]  They know it.
[01:15:36.272 --> 01:15:38.894]  And they're afraid of the chemistry with all of us just wanting freedom.
[01:15:39.115 --> 01:15:40.075]  We just want the American dream.
[01:15:40.116 --> 01:15:40.616]  We want freedom.
[01:15:41.016 --> 01:15:41.937]  We don't want to live in Venezuela.
[01:15:41.957 --> 01:15:42.518]  We want freedom.
[01:15:42.698 --> 01:15:43.479]  We don't want to be racist.
[01:15:43.499 --> 01:15:45.020]  Stop telling us we're racist all day.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.601]  Stop turning us into communists.
[01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:50.144]  We'll be back with Rufio to give his take on this and more Will Johnson.
[01:15:50.225 --> 01:15:53.708]  We're going to open the phones up in about 15 minutes so you can talk both to these heroes.
[01:15:53.728 --> 01:15:59.513]  And they are a lot of courage standing up 10 to 1 before this last rally we outnumbered them and that's why they're scared.
[01:16:00.728 --> 01:16:01.649]  We knew it was coming.
[01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:03.251]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:16:03.531 --> 01:16:16.765]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[01:16:17.686 --> 01:16:18.407]  And then voila!
[01:16:19.639 --> 01:16:29.726]  Two weeks later, banned InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[01:16:30.326 --> 01:16:49.219]  And so their answer is, have CNN, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and all these other corrupt organizations openly lobby for us to be removed and then organize their listeners, their viewers, the different university organizations, Antifa, sleeping giants, and a bunch of other groups
[01:16:50.259 --> 01:17:00.662]  To then go mass flag us in the community guidelines, which again is something out of 1984 or a Kafka novel, where you don't even know what you've supposedly done.
[01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:02.202]  You can't face your accuser.
[01:17:02.663 --> 01:17:07.764]  Then you get defamed by the claims of the big tech giants when they ban you.
[01:17:08.885 --> 01:17:22.568]  Make no mistake, this is being set up to create a precedent in their own words for you, nationalists, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, people that stand up to the New York Times editorial board member saying whites are subhuman and should be extincted.
[01:17:23.368 --> 01:17:27.849]  This is the agenda they're pushing that is being funded by Communist China.
[01:17:28.529 --> 01:17:31.150]  Out of everything I've broken down so far, that's the key.
[01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:35.271]  Apple has officially moved to China and is letting the government basically run Apple.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.361]  That, of course, is iTunes.
[01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:44.447]  Google is building a huge censorship search engine for them, and whistleblowers from inside Google say they're preparing to use it here in America.
[01:17:45.468 --> 01:17:52.915]  In fact, they're beta testing different parts of the censorship system for China on American conservatives, nationalists, and Trump supporters.
[01:17:53.495 --> 01:17:59.040]  The bigger issue is they don't like InfoWars exposing the fact in great detail.
[01:18:00.001 --> 01:18:12.487]  The Communist China owns our debt, owns and controls Hollywood now, is involved in massive domestic propaganda operations, and is working with the Democratic Party and with the EU and others to try to block the Trump agenda.
[01:18:12.767 --> 01:18:14.368]  They even talk about this at Davos.
[01:18:14.448 --> 01:18:16.789]  So this is 21st century warfare.
[01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:26.494]  It's happening right now, and it's designed to silence the American people and other populist movements around the world who are trying to struggle free from this corporate totalitarianism.
[01:18:27.014 --> 01:18:32.001]  This now becomes the last battle of the Civil War.
[01:18:32.101 --> 01:18:37.668]  You know, Fox, Breitbart, Sinclair, and Alex Jones, which has now been taken off of Facebook, thank God.
[01:18:38.249 --> 01:18:44.097]  The number one thing you can do past standing up to this and getting informed and informing others is to simply...
[01:18:44.958 --> 01:18:47.539]  Go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:18:47.959 --> 01:18:49.399]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:50.680]  Just click on the link.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.860]  Whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[01:18:54.521 --> 01:19:05.904]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform that are being censored so you can get them out to others.
[01:19:06.584 --> 01:19:10.365]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:19:10.845 --> 01:19:13.727]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[01:19:14.267 --> 01:19:19.130]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:20.731]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:19:21.092 --> 01:19:21.712]  You're an adult.
[01:19:22.052 --> 01:19:24.033]  You deserve to hear what all the hubbub's about.
[01:19:24.374 --> 01:19:29.017]  You deserve to hear what the establishment is so desperate to silence so you can make your own decision.
[01:19:29.777 --> 01:19:33.339]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:19:33.679 --> 01:19:33.900]  Listen.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.342]  I was never trying to win a popularity contest.
[01:19:36.362 --> 01:19:40.365]  I've been trying to get Americans and others to think outside the box and realize what's happening.
[01:19:40.385 --> 01:19:41.186]  We've been very successful.
[01:19:41.626 --> 01:19:42.807]  I've expected to be attacked.
[01:19:42.827 --> 01:19:46.250]  I didn't know we'd be the very tip of the spear, but it's happened.
[01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:51.555]  So now, Infowars is the banner of free speech, the renaissance in Western culture and civilization.
[01:19:51.855 --> 01:19:59.842]  And it's more important than ever that folks realize that the dominoes are beginning to fall against your cherished free speech, and you'll lose everything else if you don't stand up for it now.
[01:20:04.601 --> 01:20:07.215]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:19.254]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:19.734 --> 01:20:22.376]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.937 --> 01:20:24.518]  Hollywood is killing itself.
[01:20:24.538 --> 01:20:31.503]  They've had the Hollywood Screen Actors Guild vote to remove Trump's star officially, replacing him with Carrie Fisher.
[01:20:31.523 --> 01:20:36.608]  Who wants to be on your dirty Hollywood, you know, homeless feces needles everywhere?
[01:20:37.248 --> 01:20:45.751]  They kept attacking it and attacking it, so the West Hollywood City Council has announced they voted to ask Hollywood Chapter of Commerce to remove Donald Trump's star from the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
[01:20:46.371 --> 01:20:49.812]  At least there's a chance somebody's going to impeach his star.
[01:20:50.473 --> 01:20:51.773]  Wow, that's Bette Midler.
[01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:53.794]  These people are disconnected jokes.
[01:20:54.674 --> 01:21:07.560]  And we are joined by the great Will Johnson of UnitedAmericaFirst.com and Rufio Panman who again gets attacked over and over again 2-3-4-1 with guys with metal batons and then defends himself in flawless victory knockouts.
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:09.541]  Mike Cernovich is coming up.
[01:21:10.041 --> 01:21:13.363]  We've also got Vox Day coming on to get into all this.
[01:21:13.383 --> 01:21:17.705]  So I wanted to go to Panman and also Will Johnson, jump in any time.
[01:21:18.245 --> 01:21:22.327]  This is just a crazy, crazy time to be alive and I think
[01:21:22.887 --> 01:21:28.453]  What happened out there this weekend is one reason we've been banned, I think, our multicam coverage of it.
[01:21:28.473 --> 01:21:37.804]  But Rufio, give us your take just on the state of the world, the special elections where the Republicans just won again, where you think all this is going, what you think the commies and Soros funding are going to do next.
[01:21:40.667 --> 01:21:43.751]  Well, it's interesting after this last weekend, seeing how
[01:21:45.349 --> 01:21:51.811]  It almost seems like the attacks verbally have kind of quieted down because there's not very much they can say.
[01:21:51.871 --> 01:21:54.912]  They've just kind of been attacking platforms like yours.
[01:21:56.113 --> 01:22:00.694]  There's a lot of people that have been getting their Facebook accounts shut down and stuff like that.
[01:22:01.235 --> 01:22:13.739]  So it's kind of gone from the verbal attacks and trying to convince everybody and push the narrative to just a straight out shutting down anybody who's right of Bernie Sanders pretty much.
[01:22:14.974 --> 01:22:32.683]  So, you know, where I see things going is you're going to start seeing a lot more people like the Patriots show up like last weekend and it's just not going to get reported until, you know, we start just showing up to these news outlets and demanding that they start, you know, accurately representing what's going on.
[01:22:34.733 --> 01:22:39.997]  I just love how months ago, to recap the story, they beat up women and children and nobody was there for a little prayer event.
[01:22:40.277 --> 01:22:43.419]  They won't even let Christian conservatives, anybody, go out in public.
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:48.622]  And then you guys came, a minority of you, they attacked, you drove them off.
[01:22:49.223 --> 01:22:53.166]  But numbers-wise, it looked to me like you guys had bigger numbers than the commies.
[01:22:54.747 --> 01:22:55.927]  Is that accurate or what happened?
[01:22:55.947 --> 01:22:57.428]  What are the numbers estimated in Portland?
[01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:59.470]  What are the numbers estimated in Berkeley?
[01:23:01.387 --> 01:23:06.330]  Um, you know, the numbers in Portland were... I've never seen anything like it before.
[01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:08.551]  It was probably one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.
[01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:14.334]  I mean, we waited pretty much all day just waiting for more busloads of people to come in.
[01:23:15.814 --> 01:23:22.898]  And I think that the opposing side felt good at first until they started to see that we were just continuously bussing people in.
[01:23:25.299 --> 01:23:28.381]  And, you know, that's a huge message.
[01:23:28.441 --> 01:23:30.562]  I mean, that's pretty much, you know, Joey's mission
[01:23:31.503 --> 01:23:33.725]  Just keep having these rallies and keep being persistent.
[01:23:33.745 --> 01:23:40.410]  And obviously the optics from the 30th, you know, is pretty much why all those people came out.
[01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:41.951]  I mean, we had them from all over the place.
[01:23:42.011 --> 01:23:44.853]  New York, and I mean, just Proud Boys alone.
[01:23:44.893 --> 01:23:48.036]  We had just about every state represented, it seemed like.
[01:23:50.362 --> 01:23:54.105]  But as far as Berkeley numbers go, it looked like it was pretty thick there as well.
[01:23:55.506 --> 01:23:57.287]  I know that they have... That's right, you were there.
[01:23:58.568 --> 01:24:00.010]  You guys weren't at the other one, you were at another event.
[01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:01.351]  Let me ask you that question then.
[01:24:03.672 --> 01:24:05.174]  What do you think they're going to do next?
[01:24:05.214 --> 01:24:16.242]  Like you said, they've gone underground now and their daddy's back at the big San Francisco-run tech companies, the imperial elite, the cultural elite, as WikiLeaks called it.
[01:24:17.443 --> 01:24:18.264]  What are they going to do now?
[01:24:20.942 --> 01:24:31.091]  Well, I think Antifa on their street level is going to keep trying to find any weakness they can, and they're going to attack us whenever they can.
[01:24:32.632 --> 01:24:40.599]  But I think they're going to really push to shut down all of our platforms, shut down our voice any way they can.
[01:24:42.521 --> 01:24:45.003]  And obviously with you, you're going through that right now.
[01:24:45.764 --> 01:24:47.405]  But the Patriots are really strong.
[01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:55.722]  I don't want to have a sense of doubt as far as what we're capable of, but it's going to be a little bit, it's going to be difficult at first, I think.
[01:24:57.904 --> 01:24:59.325]  What about the Streisand effect?
[01:24:59.345 --> 01:25:02.226]  I mean, I see this, Will Johnson, really blowing up at their face.
[01:25:02.266 --> 01:25:08.430]  Their complete concerted banning of me, particularly, is to set the precedent for everybody else.
[01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:09.471]  I don't think I'm that important.
[01:25:09.851 --> 01:25:10.752]  I think they're getting ready.
[01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:11.993]  Well, they've set it to move on everybody.
[01:25:12.013 --> 01:25:13.193]  They're already moving on everybody.
[01:25:13.874 --> 01:25:15.595]  What do you think Trump and the Congress needs to do?
[01:25:17.239 --> 01:25:23.446]  You know what, I did a video asking for President Trump to step in and to bring awareness to what's actually happening here.
[01:25:24.046 --> 01:25:28.611]  This is digital book burning, just like Nazi Germany, all over again.
[01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:33.537]  And you know, in Portland, I think the numbers were like 1500 plus on our side.
[01:25:33.977 --> 01:25:35.979]  It was at least close to 2000 people.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:37.882]  In Berkeley, there was only about 30
[01:25:39.815 --> 01:25:40.576]  Yes, we are.
[01:25:55.579 --> 01:26:00.022]  Because you're a Christian, because you believe in God, and because you believe in the truth.
[01:26:00.603 --> 01:26:01.683]  They are attacking you.
[01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:04.285]  See, they find it that white people are soft targets.
[01:26:04.665 --> 01:26:10.189]  That's the reason why they go after white people, because they know for a fact that white people, for the most part, don't say anything.
[01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.969]  They don't speak out.
[01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.890]  But you do.
[01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:14.432]  And they don't like the fact that you speak out.
[01:26:14.932 --> 01:26:20.656]  And for me to come on here and acknowledge that there's a war on white people in America, this just proves it.
[01:26:21.579 --> 01:26:28.304]  This just proves that them attacking you the way they're attacking you absolutely proves that there's attack on white people in America.
[01:26:28.604 --> 01:26:30.165]  And a lot of people don't even want to acknowledge it.
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.121]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:57.642]  I mean, you had Nancy Pelosi call me a white supremacist.
[01:26:58.042 --> 01:27:02.604]  These people have lost any brain cells that they had remaining.
[01:27:02.944 --> 01:27:07.706]  You know, I like to say that they have marbles rolling around in their head, and the few that they have is just rolling around.
[01:27:08.186 --> 01:27:09.967]  I mean, so these
[01:27:10.826 --> 01:27:14.471]  Leftists, they do not care about the American people.
[01:27:15.392 --> 01:27:17.936]  When they don't care about truth, they don't care about freedom of speech.
[01:27:18.176 --> 01:27:20.339]  Can you imagine had Hillary Clinton won?
[01:27:20.619 --> 01:27:22.682]  Do you think they would be trying to ban you then?
[01:27:23.183 --> 01:27:24.825]  Do you think they'd be trying to shut you down then?
[01:27:24.925 --> 01:27:25.586]  Do you think they'd be
[01:27:25.606 --> 01:27:26.567]  Do you think they'll be blaming Russia then?
[01:27:26.807 --> 01:27:29.889]  Do you think they'll be doing all these attacks on the President of the United States?
[01:27:30.249 --> 01:27:31.410]  No, absolutely not!
[01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:33.531]  Because they're not getting what they want.
[01:27:33.992 --> 01:27:38.595]  They're trying to do everything they can, and mainly because this is the midterm election year.
[01:27:38.635 --> 01:27:44.018]  This is the most important midterm election in American history, if you ask me.
[01:27:44.038 --> 01:27:45.019]  If you ask me.
[01:27:45.099 --> 01:27:45.819]  And they know it.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.702]  That's why they want to shut you down now, before November comes.
[01:27:50.022 --> 01:27:54.285]  Because if they can't have you speaking out, they can't have you waking people up.
[01:27:54.965 --> 01:27:58.687]  They can't have you getting people to be more proactive in America.
[01:27:58.988 --> 01:28:06.592]  Never before have you ever seen so many conservatives step out in the street in Portland or any place else like you did this past weekend.
[01:28:06.612 --> 01:28:08.473]  That's right, conservatives never get out in the street.
[01:28:08.513 --> 01:28:09.274]  I think that's what scares them.
[01:28:09.294 --> 01:28:22.022]  I'll come back and talk to both of you about that, but the iconography, the imagery of a good-looking, strong crowd of people of every color, all humans, red blood, standing up for America, and then how scummy and evil their people are, this really shows
[01:28:22.842 --> 01:28:30.788]  What the establishment has got, and the type of people they have, and the fact that your crowds were more multiracial than their crowds, absolutely panicked.
[01:28:30.808 --> 01:28:38.314]  And we'll talk about that with Rufio Panman, at Rufio Panman for now on Twitter, and Will Johnson on AmericanFirst.com, Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[01:28:39.455 --> 01:28:45.382]  Our app launched three weeks ago in news is number one in the world on Apple and on Android.
[01:28:45.462 --> 01:28:51.128]  CNN and others are now calling along with the Democratic Party for it to be removed and they want us off Twitter as well.
[01:28:51.628 --> 01:28:54.412]  Just like the bad guys would do and they call us the Nazis.
[01:28:54.472 --> 01:28:55.393]  Give me a break.
[01:28:55.953 --> 01:28:59.197]  I tell you this is historic just like Martin Luther King marching in Selma.
[01:29:00.051 --> 01:29:03.496]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:29:04.016 --> 01:29:06.780]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:29:07.301 --> 01:29:13.129]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:29:13.589 --> 01:29:16.353]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:29:17.074 --> 01:29:20.517]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:26.962]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:32.327]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:29:33.087 --> 01:29:36.488]  Next, we tested the water from our AlexaPure gravity filter.
[01:29:37.008 --> 01:29:43.550]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:29:44.210 --> 01:29:48.891]  As it turns out, the filter on the AlexaPure raises the pH of the water.
[01:29:49.451 --> 01:29:54.512]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:29:55.112 --> 01:29:59.093]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:00.914]  We are launching today
[01:30:02.751 --> 01:30:04.771]  The InfoWars official app.
[01:30:05.011 --> 01:30:05.852]  It's amazing.
[01:30:05.892 --> 01:30:06.592]  It works great.
[01:30:06.992 --> 01:30:08.552]  It's got so many incredible features.
[01:30:08.812 --> 01:30:14.413]  You can download it free on Android and Apple at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:30:14.793 --> 01:30:17.554]  Or there's a big banner up on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:17.594 --> 01:30:21.675]  But why this is important is the globalists are demonizing InfoWars.
[01:30:21.795 --> 01:30:23.575]  We are the cutting edge, the tip of the spear.
[01:30:24.035 --> 01:30:26.355]  And they are so scared of people power.
[01:30:26.916 --> 01:30:28.436]  They are so scared of you.
[01:30:29.565 --> 01:30:46.262]  Not just downloading the app, but sharing it with your neighbors, your friends, folks at church, people at the grocery store, sending out a link to your email list or Facebook or Twitter and saying, hey, download the new free InfoWars app and get live video.
[01:30:46.923 --> 01:30:52.868]  Archive video, the podcast, all the new podcast shows we're going to start launching here in the next few months.
[01:30:53.409 --> 01:30:57.533]  The new broadcast, all of it, plus the latest news alerts, feeds.
[01:30:57.933 --> 01:31:06.461]  You can click a button and then get push notifications to know when things are happening or when I go live routinely from my house or I come back into the office or when I'm on the road.
[01:31:07.121 --> 01:31:09.003]  It's the InfoWars official app.
[01:31:09.563 --> 01:31:10.564]  We're launching it today.
[01:31:11.665 --> 01:31:22.754]  It's at InfoWars.com forward slash app or there's a big banner right on the right hand side of the page on InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:31:22.774 --> 01:31:28.378]  There's a lot of features like listen in the background to have the show on during any activity.
[01:31:28.658 --> 01:31:32.361]  The video can be switched right to video, not just go to the audio function.
[01:31:32.381 --> 01:31:40.767]  A list of the latest shows, live notifications when we're going live, support the show, spread the news both in and outside of the app.
[01:31:41.087 --> 01:31:50.613]  See current super sales and browse the info or store and get specials that we alert you to there via the app as well that are the biggest specials we do.
[01:31:51.474 --> 01:31:53.936]  Compatible on iPhone and Android devices.
[01:31:53.996 --> 01:31:56.158]  Infowars.com forward slash app.
[01:31:56.458 --> 01:32:01.022]  Watch the Alex Jones Show, The War Room, The Real News, anywhere, anytime.
[01:32:01.142 --> 01:32:05.606]  Read articles as they're published on the site in a portable feed.
[01:32:05.626 --> 01:32:08.708]  Get notifications anytime a feature story is published.
[01:32:09.289 --> 01:32:12.271]  Favorite and save articles to read later when you have time.
[01:32:12.711 --> 01:32:17.976]  Go back through your article history to reread favorites or pick back up where you left off.
[01:32:18.596 --> 01:32:19.858]  There is so much more.
[01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:34.394]  Just check it out for yourself right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app and then please send that link out or show people the app and that's how word of mouth we'll get four or five six million people like we got on the old app we launched.
[01:32:35.055 --> 01:32:36.876]  Six, seven years ago that was just audio only.
[01:32:36.896 --> 01:32:37.516]  Remember that one?
[01:32:38.417 --> 01:32:39.818]  That doesn't work on a lot of new phones.
[01:32:39.838 --> 01:32:42.519]  And there's hundreds of fan systems out there as well.
[01:32:42.839 --> 01:32:43.559]  They're all great.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:46.401]  We don't try to block people launching their own InfoWars apps.
[01:32:46.841 --> 01:32:47.682]  We just want to get the word out.
[01:32:47.722 --> 01:32:49.242]  But this one really is a great app.
[01:32:49.462 --> 01:32:55.085]  You can download it free on Android and Apple at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:32:55.465 --> 01:32:57.867]  Or there's a big banner up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:04.028 --> 01:33:08.610]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.731 --> 01:33:15.893]  Out here in the fields and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.256 --> 01:33:34.159]  My dad, and I'm not bragging, as I didn't do at Machiavelli, all straight shot when I did it.
[01:33:34.759 --> 01:33:35.560]  I never threatened Mueller.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:39.422]  I said I meant politically, high noon, spaghetti western music, we're gonna take him out.
[01:33:40.123 --> 01:33:41.103]  This is, you know, the showdown.
[01:33:41.123 --> 01:33:41.904]  I'm not backing down.
[01:33:42.945 --> 01:33:44.746]  They said that was violence when the ones calling for violence.
[01:33:45.406 --> 01:33:47.407]  But I knew, my dad came over the next day to my house.
[01:33:48.608 --> 01:33:49.549]  He goes, why'd you do that?
[01:33:49.649 --> 01:33:50.730]  I said, why do you think I did it?
[01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:53.832]  He said, you're pushing them to ban you.
[01:33:55.293 --> 01:33:56.934]  I had one of their plan to do it right before the election.
[01:33:56.974 --> 01:33:58.334]  You want to trigger a big debate about this.
[01:33:58.374 --> 01:33:59.635]  And I said, yep, I'm your son.
[01:34:00.135 --> 01:34:00.875]  You know me, don't you?
[01:34:00.895 --> 01:34:03.936]  He said, yeah, I think you're gonna, I think it's gonna, I think it's gonna work.
[01:34:04.856 --> 01:34:06.317]  But that's the Holy Spirit, folks.
[01:34:06.337 --> 01:34:07.757]  And I don't want to get weird on people here.
[01:34:08.277 --> 01:34:09.758]  I'm 44, about to be 45.
[01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:13.479]  And I've learned to go with my gut, go with my spirit.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.900]  When I listen to it, everything turns out well.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.741]  When I don't, things get bad.
[01:34:18.521 --> 01:34:20.042]  And they were already bandits.
[01:34:20.062 --> 01:34:21.162]  They'd already shadow bandits.
[01:34:21.182 --> 01:34:22.322]  They'd already do it to everybody else.
[01:34:23.023 --> 01:34:24.143]  So we had to push them.
[01:34:26.641 --> 01:34:29.943]  I know Project Veritas and others have gotten into the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[01:34:29.963 --> 01:34:31.123]  They're really upset that's coming out.
[01:34:31.443 --> 01:34:32.824]  They don't want us to magnify that.
[01:34:33.444 --> 01:34:35.525]  They don't want Dinesh D'Souza's film getting promoted here.
[01:34:35.945 --> 01:34:38.527]  We've got internal stuff that will come out soon why they're freaked out.
[01:34:39.267 --> 01:34:47.891]  Because there are people in Google and these other platforms that are starting to blow the whistle because what they're hearing is so evil and so out of control and so bad.
[01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:57.004]  I took my wife to see this over the weekend, Death of a Nation, and when you have studied history like I have, the movie is so accurate.
[01:34:59.329 --> 01:35:04.032]  I don't normally get tears in my eyes during a movie, but my wife looked over and I had tears streaming down my face five or six times.
[01:35:04.913 --> 01:35:10.656]  And it was only because, it wasn't even tears of pain or even joy, it was tears of, thank God this is out.
[01:35:10.676 --> 01:35:16.220]  And then when he exposed Soros as a Nazi at the end, when I know for a fact, man, they have told me that's why they're coming after me.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:17.081]  That's one of the big reasons.
[01:35:17.561 --> 01:35:20.323]  It just felt so good to know there were other people that weren't cowards.
[01:35:20.403 --> 01:35:26.407]  And to see it, I don't want to give the whole movie away, but they don't show it in most liberal theaters around the country.
[01:35:26.427 --> 01:35:27.148]  They're trying to block it.
[01:35:28.288 --> 01:35:29.008]  It's an amazing time.
[01:35:29.028 --> 01:35:32.830]  Before I go back to Rufio and Will Johnson and talk about this, you know, this big fight that's coming.
[01:35:34.051 --> 01:35:36.472]  If you don't financially support us, that's the other part of the equation.
[01:35:36.512 --> 01:35:37.333]  They will shut us down.
[01:35:38.773 --> 01:35:39.854]  We can beat these lawsuits.
[01:35:39.894 --> 01:35:40.974]  Soros is financing.
[01:35:40.994 --> 01:35:44.436]  We've been beating some of them, but it's very expensive to get the right lawyers to actually win.
[01:35:45.036 --> 01:35:46.617]  And I mean, we're talking a lot.
[01:35:47.297 --> 01:35:49.859]  So this is a major war chest, a major fight.
[01:35:50.999 --> 01:35:51.660]  Fight the bullies.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:52.760]  Save the Internet.
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:53.581]  Save InfoWars.
[01:35:53.621 --> 01:35:54.241]  Super special.
[01:35:54.561 --> 01:35:56.182]  We've launched just because of all the censorship.
[01:35:57.526 --> 01:36:00.607]  And we've got Brain Force Plus, the amazing, healthy, nootropic for your brain.
[01:36:00.887 --> 01:36:01.407]  Just try it.

[01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:21.982]  They believe they can just shut us down and move on.
[01:37:22.723 --> 01:37:26.526]  Do lots of mid-level censorship and you'd finally go to sleep when they drop the hammer.
[01:37:28.103 --> 01:37:35.267]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to, with our guest, I'm going to get into Ingram Defends Infowars Coordinated Purge of Sources We Trust and Like.
[01:37:35.928 --> 01:37:38.089]  And so it's a big report up on Infowars.com.
[01:37:38.949 --> 01:37:43.392]  The fact that Tucker Carlson, the fact that Michael Savage, the fact that even the Daily Mail gets what's happening.
[01:37:44.112 --> 01:37:45.893]  This is a big deal and a big moment.
[01:37:46.013 --> 01:37:47.995]  They always use that Photoshop weird photo of me.
[01:37:48.015 --> 01:37:48.855]  It didn't even look like me.
[01:37:49.235 --> 01:37:49.736]  But they love it.
[01:37:50.536 --> 01:37:51.737]  Somebody says use that photo.
[01:37:51.777 --> 01:37:58.601]  So going back to Rufio Panman from the Proud Boys and Gavin McGinnis was on earlier and Will Johnson.
[01:37:58.621 --> 01:38:01.463]  Just other points you guys want to make after this question.
[01:38:02.847 --> 01:38:19.472]  The symbolism of people not starting the fight, picking up their bubble gum wrappers, no problems, being nice to the police, coming in, leaving things the way they were, and people attacking police, crapping on the ground, yelling and screaming obscenities, getting arrested, everywhere.
[01:38:19.732 --> 01:38:22.533]  This is the deranged left, Rufio Pammon.
[01:38:22.713 --> 01:38:24.173]  Why are they such scum?
[01:38:24.493 --> 01:38:26.254]  Why are they such archetypal trash?
[01:38:26.294 --> 01:38:27.334]  Who the hell are these people?
[01:38:30.382 --> 01:38:47.407]  Well, I think it's an accumulation of everybody who has never wanted to abide by any rules, never really wanted to accomplish anything for themselves, and, you know, that's just kind of what embodies extreme leftists in Antifa.
[01:38:48.207 --> 01:38:53.649]  It's really hard to characterize who they are, it's just because it's so inhuman, almost, the way that they act.
[01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:56.329]  They're a bunch of lazy scum that tell us we are what they are.
[01:38:57.970 --> 01:38:58.190]  Right.
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:00.461]  Yeah, so it's all name-calling.
[01:39:00.521 --> 01:39:02.884]  It's like kindergarten bullies, really.
[01:39:03.284 --> 01:39:04.705]  They don't really have anything good to say.
[01:39:04.745 --> 01:39:09.549]  Even their chants are very amateur-ish, I guess you could say.
[01:39:09.569 --> 01:39:14.333]  They're very uncreative, and... Yeah, it's not.
[01:39:14.373 --> 01:39:20.779]  The answer to 1984, 1776, and we, humanity, are awake and rising, and freedom beats in the human breast, and we will not be stopped!
[01:39:20.979 --> 01:39:22.140]  Yeah!
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:23.461]  No, it's... Racist!
[01:39:23.501 --> 01:39:24.082]  Go to hell!
[01:39:26.266 --> 01:39:26.966]  Right, yeah.
[01:39:27.266 --> 01:39:27.887]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:27.927 --> 01:39:29.407]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[01:39:29.427 --> 01:39:30.107]  Same message.
[01:39:30.167 --> 01:39:30.727]  Nothing new.
[01:39:30.787 --> 01:39:31.948]  No actual leadership.
[01:39:32.408 --> 01:39:33.488]  You never see their face.
[01:39:34.088 --> 01:39:35.469]  No sense of responsibility.
[01:39:36.789 --> 01:39:38.050]  You know, it's just a bunch of garbage.
[01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:39.810]  Oh, what about the ordinance now?
[01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:41.130]  I'll come back to you in a moment.
[01:39:41.871 --> 01:39:50.173]  Let me ask Will Johnson, what about the ordinance they can't wear masks after they attack the police and elderly and people that weren't even with the prayer vigil six months ago that you launched?
[01:39:51.914 --> 01:39:53.854]  How did that affect them not being able to wear their masks?
[01:39:54.294 --> 01:39:55.815]  They looked like they were pissing their pants.
[01:39:57.113 --> 01:39:58.414]  They were highly upset.
[01:39:58.894 --> 01:39:59.535]  And you know what?
[01:39:59.735 --> 01:40:05.500]  A lot of them came in there with their mask on, and then when they were standing with their mask on, I had my megaphone, and I would just get on the megaphone.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.043]  I would scream out, officer, officer, he has on a mask, he has on a mask.
[01:40:09.483 --> 01:40:12.645]  And automatically, when the police officers start walking towards them, they have to pull them off.
[01:40:13.026 --> 01:40:15.468]  And they were getting upset because I kept calling them out.
[01:40:16.168 --> 01:40:22.036]  If you're not committing any crimes, if you don't want to do something wrong and not get caught, you typically put on a mask.
[01:40:22.517 --> 01:40:25.961]  That's a clear indication that these people are coming out here wanting to harm us.
[01:40:26.442 --> 01:40:29.565]  I've had multiple people say that you shouldn't have these rallies.
[01:40:29.946 --> 01:40:30.467]  I'm like, why?
[01:40:30.507 --> 01:40:32.129]  Because people want to come out and harm you.
[01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:41.352]  So, you're basically saying that our freedom of speech should go away because we should be afraid that these people come out here with masks on, wanting to harm us.
[01:40:41.672 --> 01:40:45.453]  See, Antifa in Berkeley, there was a city ordinance where they could not wear any mask.
[01:40:46.193 --> 01:40:51.714]  And when they walked in with a mask, the police department would not allow them to walk past their brocade.
[01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:52.755]  They could not get past it.
[01:40:53.375 --> 01:40:58.696]  So, the city ordinance, and another thing, I shared this video with Rob Dew, where the
[01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:04.096]  City Ordinance, when you had Antifa members and people for BAM and etc.
[01:41:04.377 --> 01:41:19.164]  show up, these Democratic Socialists show up to the town hall that they had, screaming and pleading with them to say, allow Antifa to have weapons and allow Antifa to have masks on so they can protect us from the Neo-Nazis.
[01:41:19.984 --> 01:41:22.846]  So last time I remember, it was our event
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.803]  We didn't allow them to have masks on.
[01:41:27.023 --> 01:41:28.485]  We didn't ask them to even come.
[01:41:28.725 --> 01:41:32.209]  But they wanted to come and wear masks and have weapons so that they can harm us.
[01:41:33.190 --> 01:41:35.532]  This is the norm from the left.
[01:41:36.273 --> 01:41:40.257]  They want to harm people who respect the president and love this country.
[01:41:40.497 --> 01:41:41.719]  What kind of world do we live in?
[01:41:41.979 --> 01:41:42.840]  This is America.
[01:41:43.911 --> 01:41:44.591]  It's crazy.
[01:41:44.671 --> 01:41:45.211]  Well, that's it.
[01:41:45.532 --> 01:41:46.212]  They're the bullies.
[01:41:46.292 --> 01:41:50.573]  But now, when they attack Rufio and you guys 10 to 1, they get their butts kicked.
[01:41:50.733 --> 01:41:52.834]  Now, Rufio, what's going to happen to them after this?
[01:41:52.854 --> 01:41:54.134]  This seemed to really demoralize them.
[01:41:56.795 --> 01:42:00.456]  Well, you know, I don't know how much more vandalism they have to do.
[01:42:00.476 --> 01:42:03.337]  Like that one clip, they were just attacking that Marine Corps recruiting office.
[01:42:03.397 --> 01:42:06.418]  I mean, that's government property right there.
[01:42:06.438 --> 01:42:12.380]  They're lucky that they didn't run into 10 Marines that just bumped out of there and beat their butt.
[01:42:14.370 --> 01:42:21.098]  Um, you know, that was something I keep looking at is like how stupid you have to be to go and attack, you know, the Marine Corps office.
[01:42:21.779 --> 01:42:34.533]  And the funny thing is, we have a lot of military, a lot of Marines in the Army and Navy Air Force that show up to these rallies because this is what they signed up to do, you know, fight enemies foreign and domestic, domestic.
[01:42:35.547 --> 01:42:41.251]  It's really cool to watch him come out and just come alive because this is like, you know, they're really truly defending America.
[01:42:41.372 --> 01:42:43.473]  Let me ask you a question when we come back.
[01:42:43.553 --> 01:42:44.514]  They knew it was Sunday.
[01:42:44.534 --> 01:42:45.315]  They knew it was Saturday.
[01:42:45.335 --> 01:42:45.955]  They attacked it.
[01:42:46.956 --> 01:42:50.078]  And they actually have intelligence files we've gotten that come out before.
[01:42:50.458 --> 01:42:52.860]  They target and pick things where they won't meet opposition.
[01:42:53.341 --> 01:42:56.023]  So I'd love for them to go do that, like you said, like on a Tuesday afternoon.
[01:42:56.463 --> 01:42:57.083]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:57.103 --> 01:42:57.544]  Stay with us.
[01:43:00.433 --> 01:43:14.012]  I told you that we could retake America if you believed in capitalism, if you believed in freedom, if you believed in God, if you believed that you had some control over your destiny.
[01:43:14.813 --> 01:43:15.454]  And now we're here.
[01:43:16.613 --> 01:43:23.176]  As we're in the hottest part of the summer, going into the fall, the left is calling for civil war, total censorship of Infowars.
[01:43:23.416 --> 01:43:31.439]  They're lying about the president more than more, calling for violence against him, calling for him to be removed, calling for his family to be kidnapped, murdered, tortured.
[01:43:32.219 --> 01:43:32.720]  It's everywhere.
[01:43:33.281 --> 01:43:38.829]  And then Trump says mainstream media is the enemy of the American people when they're fake news and lying.
[01:43:38.849 --> 01:43:42.435]  They go, Oh my God, you're going to cause us to get hurt.
[01:43:42.855 --> 01:43:47.322]  You've got Democrat candidates in Kentucky making jokes and saying, Hey,
[01:43:48.223 --> 01:43:50.204]  Rand Paul can be beaten for the Senate race.
[01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:51.504]  Look at what his neighbor did.
[01:43:52.065 --> 01:43:52.645]  It's everywhere.
[01:43:52.665 --> 01:43:54.526]  If I try to list it all, it'd take an hour.
[01:43:54.926 --> 01:43:57.067]  They're trying to bully us into submission.
[01:43:58.187 --> 01:44:07.991]  So now more than ever, with them all over the news saying de-platform us and lying about what we stand for and filing all these frivolous fake lawsuits that we're getting thrown out, this is the critical battle.
[01:44:08.251 --> 01:44:09.792]  Getting Trump in was just the beachhead.
[01:44:10.212 --> 01:44:12.533]  Now the real fight for liberty begins.
[01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:14.634]  We're entering the season of false flags.
[01:44:15.897 --> 01:44:22.542]  Uh, where the mainstream media knows it has no viewers, knows that it's basically now just corporate engines of censorship, just like the colleges.
[01:44:23.043 --> 01:44:31.870]  And so, they're putting out the breadcrumbs out there, clearly having their own people, in my view, calling into C-SPAN and, you know, calling for CNN to get shot.
[01:44:33.359 --> 01:44:34.520]  I've been telling you that's coming.
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:42.544]  So we need to stop the violence, we need to say no violence, we need to decry violence, so that when and if they stage events, people see through it.
[01:44:43.525 --> 01:44:47.247]  I came out the day the drone attack happened in Venezuela.
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:53.982]  Before any other media picks it up and I said, I don't hear any explosions, I don't see any smoke, this looks totally staged in the video I see.
[01:44:54.222 --> 01:44:58.704]  And now even our own government and foreign governments are saying it appears to be a false flag.
[01:44:59.444 --> 01:45:00.905]  False flags do happen.
[01:45:00.965 --> 01:45:02.345]  Some things are real, obviously.
[01:45:02.865 --> 01:45:04.406]  But communists and scumbags...
[01:45:05.106 --> 01:45:08.968]  Like a dictator of Venezuela who has staged elections, I believe has staged this.
[01:45:09.428 --> 01:45:16.432]  So don't think the Democrats, who are totally desperate, won't pull that card of victim when they're building it up, building it up, building it up.
[01:45:16.653 --> 01:45:32.542]  How many months have I been saying we're entering the false flag area, where CNN or MSNBC or these other terrorist organizations against America that terrorize the truth, that lobby for the end of free speech, that lobby for their competitors to be taken off the air, that send out the reporters to stalk people and harass them.
[01:45:33.462 --> 01:45:38.924]  They're murderers and assassins of truth, and don't think their bosses aren't willing to go all the way.
[01:45:39.945 --> 01:45:43.906]  With that said, there is a way to defeat them and stand against their attempts to shut us down.

[01:47:27.850 --> 01:47:33.551]  The torpedoes I launched hit them a long time ago, so they can always have their victory if they want.
[01:47:34.032 --> 01:47:36.612]  I chose this a long time ago.
[01:47:36.632 --> 01:47:41.553]  Dianne Feinstein's Chai Com Control, she is a Chinese communist agent.
[01:47:42.753 --> 01:47:44.494]  It's all gonna come out.
[01:47:45.450 --> 01:47:49.217]  And then there's a good seven or eight other senators that are on the payroll.
[01:47:49.637 --> 01:47:50.619]  A lot of House members.
[01:47:50.679 --> 01:47:53.163]  So, you guys just had to keep pushing.
[01:47:53.243 --> 01:47:54.305]  Mueller and the rest of you.
[01:47:54.345 --> 01:47:56.890]  So, it's all going to come out.
[01:48:00.822 --> 01:48:07.129]  I told the New York Times on Friday that, and boy, I said, why are some big senators being exposed as shiny spies?
[01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:08.631]  It all came out two days later.
[01:48:08.651 --> 01:48:11.114]  They crapped their bridges, man.
[01:48:11.474 --> 01:48:13.076]  They hit the emergency line.
[01:48:13.457 --> 01:48:15.259]  Because I was hitting a lot of these top reporters.
[01:48:15.279 --> 01:48:16.660]  A lot of them are operatives for the Globalist.
[01:48:17.441 --> 01:48:21.344]  Let them know so they panic button and do what they did.
[01:48:21.944 --> 01:48:23.385]  Which they did.
[01:48:23.705 --> 01:48:24.966]  I didn't lie to them to get them to do it.
[01:48:25.406 --> 01:48:32.191]  And I don't particularly like putting myself in this position, but if I can... It's called a gambit in the military, or a pawn sacrifice.
[01:48:32.711 --> 01:48:45.020]  If I can go out in a reconnaissance operation, and there's a good chance I'm going to get wiped out doing it, but I draw their artillery fire to show where their emplacements are for the jets to come in and take them out, well that's going to save thousands of people.
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:46.861]  And if I get wiped out in the process,
[01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:52.825]  If it's a war for my family and my children in the future, I'm ready to be sent on that mission.
[01:48:53.186 --> 01:48:54.286]  And I've told everybody.
[01:48:54.326 --> 01:48:55.247]  I've volunteered for it.
[01:48:55.647 --> 01:48:56.088]  I've done it.
[01:48:56.248 --> 01:48:56.908]  That's what we're doing.
[01:48:57.269 --> 01:49:00.491]  And these globalists just keep thinking of destroying me, attacking me, against me.
[01:49:01.011 --> 01:49:02.573]  I consider myself dead already.
[01:49:03.313 --> 01:49:05.175]  And I'm not trying to be fanciful about that.
[01:49:05.475 --> 01:49:06.736]  They take me serious because they know.
[01:49:07.616 --> 01:49:08.757]  Now the public's starting to get it.
[01:49:08.797 --> 01:49:09.998]  This is not a game here, folks.
[01:49:11.019 --> 01:49:13.021]  Rufio, Pam, and the great work you're doing.
[01:49:13.401 --> 01:49:14.782]  Will Johnson, we salute you.
[01:49:14.822 --> 01:49:15.903]  You guys have done a great job.
[01:49:17.566 --> 01:49:20.969]  Other points you want to make, other angles you want to hit in closing, Rufio?
[01:49:24.072 --> 01:49:29.737]  Well, you know, a lot of people, they ask me, you know, why is it that you continue to go out and do what you do?
[01:49:30.317 --> 01:49:41.907]  And sometimes, you know, after some of these rallies, it's tempting to, you know, to maybe think maybe I should step back, maybe I should just enjoy the summer with my family.
[01:49:42.568 --> 01:49:44.049]  But then I'm immediately, you know,
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:53.245]  I immediately remember, you know, how much longer is it going to be until this stuff shows up to my front door and to your front door?
[01:49:53.285 --> 01:49:54.846]  And that's what I keep telling people.
[01:49:54.926 --> 01:50:01.170]  I mean, you know, how much longer do we have if we don't fight back until this is, you know, out of control?
[01:50:02.009 --> 01:50:10.353]  And as far as I can see on the streets and as far as I can see with what you're dealing with, you know, we're not far from that reality if we don't do something.
[01:50:10.433 --> 01:50:20.138]  So I just encourage people to get involved however they can, whether it's support platforms like you or get out there on the streets with me, you know, or Will Johnson.
[01:50:20.839 --> 01:50:22.480]  You know, just do what you can for your country.
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:23.600]  It's beautiful what you guys are doing.
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:26.161]  When's the next event or how people join Proud Boys?
[01:50:26.182 --> 01:50:26.882]  How do they get involved?
[01:50:28.884 --> 01:50:32.547]  We do have an event in Seattle on the 18th, I believe.
[01:50:32.567 --> 01:50:37.291]  I haven't fully verified that I'm going yet, but I probably will be.
[01:50:37.752 --> 01:50:39.393]  We have events going on all the time.
[01:50:39.413 --> 01:50:43.176]  I know Will Johnson is going to events all the time and hosting events.
[01:50:44.459 --> 01:50:59.251]  You know, you can find us on Proud Boys, you can go to your local chapter, so your local state chapter betting page if you want, or you can hit me up on my page and we'll try and get you set up and incorporated.
[01:50:59.682 --> 01:51:01.764]  So we need the shadow ban on Twitter for you to end.
[01:51:01.784 --> 01:51:05.628]  Let's put you back up on Twitter as a test, because I can plug the app that goes to number one in the world.
[01:51:06.009 --> 01:51:10.153]  Let's put up Rufio Panman's Twitter, because right now that's the place not censoring as bad.
[01:51:10.193 --> 01:51:10.994]  God, they were the worst.
[01:51:11.694 --> 01:51:17.500]  At Rufio Panman, R-U-F-I-O Panman, R-U-F-I-O Panman.
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:21.024]  Everybody go join that, because he's got 2,400 followers.
[01:51:21.044 --> 01:51:22.165]  He needs 10 billion followers.
[01:51:22.225 --> 01:51:22.726]  God almighty.
[01:51:23.966 --> 01:51:29.330]  And by the way, all Trump needs to do is plug Gab on his Twitter, and that's it for Twitter.
[01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:30.731]  And I'm not saying I want to destroy Twitter.
[01:51:30.771 --> 01:51:35.755]  I'm just saying I think Dorsey realizes that people are fully aware of what's going on.
[01:51:36.115 --> 01:51:37.095]  Rufio, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:51:37.135 --> 01:51:37.656]  God bless you.
[01:51:37.916 --> 01:51:38.817]  We really respect you.
[01:51:38.837 --> 01:51:40.418]  Our prayers and hopes go with you.
[01:51:41.839 --> 01:51:42.659]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:47.823]  Going back and closing with Will Johnson, then I'll get to this big story with Ingram defending Infowars.
[01:51:49.244 --> 01:51:50.565]  Our hopes and prayers are with you, too.
[01:51:50.765 --> 01:51:52.026]  You're our future, my friend.
[01:51:52.066 --> 01:51:53.107]  So what do you want to say in closing?
[01:51:54.542 --> 01:51:54.962]  You know what?
[01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:58.104]  I want to say hashtag free Alex Jones.
[01:51:59.024 --> 01:52:00.285]  I started spreading it around.
[01:52:00.565 --> 01:52:02.386]  Hashtag free Alex Jones.
[01:52:03.006 --> 01:52:05.747]  What they're doing is absolutely unbelievable.
[01:52:06.347 --> 01:52:06.928]  And you know what?
[01:52:07.048 --> 01:52:12.230]  As long as God keep putting breath in me, I'm going to keep fighting for the truth and fighting for what's right.
[01:52:12.610 --> 01:52:14.291]  That's why I go out to these events.
[01:52:14.751 --> 01:52:19.794]  A lot of people, when I go out to these events, they're afraid because they're afraid of what Antifa, BLM and BAM is going to do.
[01:52:20.914 --> 01:52:22.675]  When you don't do anything,
[01:52:23.476 --> 01:52:25.837]  Is you end up in the situation that we're in right now.
[01:52:26.117 --> 01:52:36.982]  For over the past 20 years, we should have had Americans step up, especially when Obama was in office, in greater numbers than ever before, to stop what is taking place.
[01:52:37.022 --> 01:52:38.543]  They've already removed God from schools.
[01:52:38.563 --> 01:52:40.544]  They removed God from the courthouses.
[01:52:40.584 --> 01:52:42.145]  They removed God from public venues.
[01:52:42.165 --> 01:52:44.006]  They removed God from your place of business.
[01:52:44.406 --> 01:52:46.967]  They want to remove God from everything out of sight, out of mind.
[01:52:47.567 --> 01:52:49.188]  But they've already done it.
[01:52:49.588 --> 01:52:50.969]  But now is the time.
[01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:52.765]  To try to reverse all that.
[01:52:52.825 --> 01:52:55.387]  And thank God we have Donald J. Trump as our president.
[01:52:55.707 --> 01:52:57.928]  Because he's doing so many positive things for everybody in this nation.
[01:52:57.948 --> 01:52:58.409]  Well, exactly.
[01:52:58.429 --> 01:53:01.351]  He brought the blessing of Abraham back in at his inauguration.
[01:53:01.371 --> 01:53:02.351]  He said, we want the blessing.
[01:53:02.371 --> 01:53:03.212]  We bring God back in.
[01:53:03.512 --> 01:53:04.533]  He realized it was a ritual.
[01:53:04.773 --> 01:53:06.954]  In 60 seconds, why do they hate Trump so much?
[01:53:07.235 --> 01:53:08.375]  He's fulfilling his promises.
[01:53:08.415 --> 01:53:09.216]  He's so truthful.
[01:53:09.516 --> 01:53:12.098]  So they say he's a liar, though they're the liars.
[01:53:13.413 --> 01:53:14.353]  You know why they hate him?
[01:53:14.613 --> 01:53:16.374]  Because he's doing positive things.
[01:53:17.074 --> 01:53:17.955]  Look at the economy.
[01:53:18.355 --> 01:53:20.696]  Look at black people, the employment for black people.
[01:53:20.716 --> 01:53:22.076]  Look at the employment for Hispanics.
[01:53:22.517 --> 01:53:28.939]  Look how we're becoming respected as far as strength across the world and America right now.
[01:53:28.999 --> 01:53:32.961]  And getting back to that, he's not doing the whole affirmative action or welfare to keep people under control.
[01:53:33.301 --> 01:53:39.063]  He is directing factories though to minority areas and incentivizing being hired so people have a future.
[01:53:40.262 --> 01:53:44.724]  Well, they can't stand the fact that he's doing positive things because people say, you know what, I have a job.
[01:53:45.144 --> 01:53:47.465]  Trump has not done anything that I disagree with.
[01:53:47.786 --> 01:53:50.227]  And they hear people saying that at an alarming rate.
[01:53:50.687 --> 01:53:55.589]  And they can't have people like Alex Jones, Infowars, pushing that message.
[01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:58.831]  And by the way, they have 15% more Democrats in the Gallup and all those.
[01:53:59.371 --> 01:54:04.293]  Double the amount of black Americans, Hispanic Americans, others supporting Trump now than what it was just six months ago.
[01:54:04.794 --> 01:54:05.874]  It's probably way worse than that.
[01:54:06.054 --> 01:54:07.675]  That's why they're freaking out so bad.
[01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:09.482]  They're afraid.
[01:54:09.523 --> 01:54:10.583]  You're absolutely right.
[01:54:10.603 --> 01:54:11.184]  They're afraid.
[01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:12.725]  How come they just can't change the channel?
[01:54:13.426 --> 01:54:15.267]  How come you can't go look at a different news feed?
[01:54:15.828 --> 01:54:18.930]  Why is Alex Jones Infowars so scary to them?
[01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:21.212]  Because American people are waking up.
[01:54:21.652 --> 01:54:23.834]  And you're absolutely doing it.
[01:54:24.054 --> 01:54:24.895]  No, you're doing it, brother.
[01:54:24.915 --> 01:54:25.715]  We're in this together.
[01:54:26.436 --> 01:54:29.939]  Yes, we're in this together, but because of platforms like yours,
[01:54:30.698 --> 01:54:32.339]  It's because of platforms like mine.
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:34.321]  Just to be honest.
[01:54:34.881 --> 01:54:36.683]  Of course, we all give God the glory.
[01:54:36.943 --> 01:54:42.287]  But we have to do our part in this battle, in this spiritual war.
[01:54:42.367 --> 01:54:43.387]  Johnson, they're scared of you.
[01:54:43.448 --> 01:54:44.288]  You've taken action.
[01:54:44.688 --> 01:54:48.591]  You already got them to admit that Antifa's terrorists by you having the prayer vigil with folks.
[01:54:48.932 --> 01:54:49.592]  So we salute you.
[01:54:49.612 --> 01:54:50.393]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:54:50.433 --> 01:54:50.853]  We love you.
[01:54:51.053 --> 01:54:51.694]  And be safe.
[01:54:52.694 --> 01:54:53.115]  Thank you, sir.
[01:54:54.141 --> 01:54:57.864]  We've got Mike Cernovich and Vox Day joining us next hour.
[01:54:57.905 --> 01:55:00.427]  I need to get to this in this little segment, part of the next.
[01:55:01.288 --> 01:55:05.612]  Laura Ingram, Michael Savage, Tucker Carlson has come out in support of us.
[01:55:05.672 --> 01:55:06.913]  Matt Drudge has been there.
[01:55:06.933 --> 01:55:07.614]  Without Drudge...
[01:55:09.068 --> 01:55:11.168]  Again, it's just everybody we've got on the team.
[01:55:11.268 --> 01:55:12.169]  Without them, we'd lose.
[01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:15.049]  It's just like, it's like you see how it's just like this and this, folks.
[01:55:15.129 --> 01:55:15.869]  It's like biblical.
[01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:18.970]  And thank God people understand their line about me.
[01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:20.050]  They demonized me first.
[01:55:20.650 --> 01:55:24.151]  Then they, then they come after me and they think if people don't notice, they're going to get everybody.
[01:55:24.451 --> 01:55:26.812]  But now we're going to have a debate about censorship just like I wanted.
[01:55:26.832 --> 01:55:28.332]  That's why I put myself in there.
[01:55:28.392 --> 01:55:29.512]  I covered the censorship.
[01:55:29.852 --> 01:55:30.712]  I covered what they were doing.
[01:55:30.913 --> 01:55:33.333]  I knew they'd ban me for it, but I knew it had to be done.
[01:55:33.553 --> 01:55:35.593]  And it's just my, my spirit keeps coming through.
[01:55:35.934 --> 01:55:37.834]  Here's the first of what Ingram was saying last night.
[01:55:41.957 --> 01:55:46.761]  Remember what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told a Senate hearing back in April?
[01:55:48.463 --> 01:55:50.485]  There is certain content that clearly we do not allow.
[01:55:50.505 --> 01:55:59.212]  Hate speech, terrorist content, nudity, anything that makes people feel unsafe in the community.
[01:56:00.413 --> 01:56:05.858]  From that perspective, that's why we generally try to refer to what we do as a platform for all ideas.
[01:56:07.223 --> 01:56:09.518]  A platform for all ideas, really?
[01:56:10.518 --> 01:56:17.000]  Over the past few months, Facebook and other tech giants have given us ample reason to doubt that proclamation.
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:28.483]  The latest example started early yesterday morning, when Apple pulled several podcasts associated with the controversial and often incendiary Alex Jones from the iTunes Store.
[01:56:29.283 --> 01:56:38.206]  Facebook followed suit, unpublishing four of Jones' pages, claiming the videos on those pages violated that hate speech policy.
[01:56:39.065 --> 01:56:50.048]  Hours later, YouTube decided it wasn't going to miss out on all that censorship fun, and YouTube suspended the Alex Jones Channel with its 2.4 million subscribers.
[01:56:50.268 --> 01:56:50.828]  Stop right there.
[01:56:50.968 --> 01:56:52.208]  We're going to come back with more of this.
[01:56:52.268 --> 01:56:53.189]  It's not Ingram's fault.
[01:56:53.209 --> 01:56:53.769]  She's busy.
[01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:55.529]  This is what they do.
[01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:58.670]  They banned a few of our things the week before, so that would be the story.
[01:56:58.890 --> 01:56:59.910]  Then they banned everything.
[01:57:00.210 --> 01:57:01.291]  Total deplatforming.
[01:57:01.611 --> 01:57:02.551]  Now they've gone after...
[01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:06.131]  Discuss, that's just a comment so you can talk.
[01:57:06.451 --> 01:57:07.511]  A lot of it attacking me.
[01:57:07.851 --> 01:57:12.552]  Now they kicked us off MailChimp so we can't send emails to you that go through the proper systems to follow the laws.
[01:57:12.853 --> 01:57:24.056]  Then they're hitting all our server companies, lying, filing fake complaints that, hey, I got racist stuff or child porn or bank documents off this thing.
[01:57:25.256 --> 01:57:26.776]  I should have opened the show up for that.
[01:57:26.816 --> 01:57:29.077]  I mean, they are trying to shut it all down.
[01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:39.137]  We've gone from launching a new app three weeks ago, it was in the top 50, to going to number one on Android and iTunes.
[01:57:39.597 --> 01:57:42.039]  It's now number one in CNN every hour, I'm told.
[01:57:42.079 --> 01:57:49.165]  I've seen three reports saying, shut it down, shut it down, shut it down, because the truth's popular and the lie is not.
[01:57:54.689 --> 01:57:58.051]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com,
[01:57:59.517 --> 01:58:00.258]  We're good to go.
[01:58:25.137 --> 01:58:36.743]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:58:36.803 --> 01:58:46.688]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:58:47.288 --> 01:58:47.949]  We're good to go.
[01:59:06.988 --> 01:59:10.069]  We are following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country.
[01:59:10.450 --> 01:59:12.511]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:59:12.991 --> 01:59:17.933]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is or what sex we are or where we came from.
[01:59:18.493 --> 01:59:26.157]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:59:26.657 --> 01:59:33.360]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:35.061]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:35.481 --> 01:59:37.042]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:37.343 --> 01:59:38.884]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:39.524 --> 01:59:41.186]  And many others are across the world.
[01:59:41.426 --> 01:59:42.186]  We are the future.
[01:59:43.127 --> 01:59:44.068]  We are the renaissance.
[01:59:44.608 --> 01:59:45.889]  And we are winning.
[01:59:52.014 --> 01:59:57.919]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.626 --> 02:00:19.290]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:26.777]  And YouTube suspended the Alex Jones Channel with its 2.4 million subscribers.
[02:00:35.014 --> 02:00:45.364]  Oh, it's easy to dismiss concerns about big tech's actions, all coordinated, it seems, to shut down Jones because, of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories.
[02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:48.548]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:56.776]  This is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like.
[02:00:58.075 --> 02:01:08.479]  If big tech can control the information flow, then they can also perhaps even influence the outcome of the midterms and even future presidential elections.
[02:01:09.579 --> 02:01:13.881]  Essentially, Alex Jones has been deleted, digitally de-platformed from these websites.
[02:01:14.221 --> 02:01:20.363]  You wonder if he'll have any influence going forward because these private companies do have an incredible amount of control over the internet.
[02:01:21.209 --> 02:01:22.009]  And that's the point.
[02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:29.350]  Controlling who has a voice and who doesn't on these monster platforms is tantamount to limiting speech.
[02:01:29.850 --> 02:01:33.431]  And as you'll see in a moment, it's also viewpoint discrimination.
[02:01:33.451 --> 02:01:40.152]  Notice that Turd Blossom, Brian Stelter, doesn't tell you, like you didn't watch the days before, that he's lobbying for us to be taken off.
[02:01:40.512 --> 02:01:43.073]  He then goes, oh my god, they took him off, oh!
[02:01:44.153 --> 02:01:47.513]  It's just because, here's the thing, he can never tell the truth.
[02:01:48.234 --> 02:01:49.014]  He's of his father.
[02:01:49.034 --> 02:01:50.554]  Let's continue.
[02:01:51.846 --> 02:01:53.827]  It's also viewpoint discrimination.
[02:01:54.807 --> 02:02:03.031]  Back in February, Facebook launched a new algorithm that would cause top conservative pages to see a dramatic drop in traffic.
[02:02:03.631 --> 02:02:05.652]  And this included personal pages, by the way.
[02:02:06.492 --> 02:02:11.435]  President Trump's Facebook page saw a 45% drop.
[02:02:12.155 --> 02:02:15.636]  But boss, notice I told you all this because we have the graphs internally.
[02:02:16.157 --> 02:02:20.679]  They did a 50% drop after the election and then they've just been squeezing ever since so you don't notice.
[02:02:20.959 --> 02:02:21.299]  Continue.
[02:02:21.889 --> 02:02:25.045]  ...said their content was similarly blocked on Facebook.
[02:02:26.069 --> 02:02:40.732]  Facebook along with other social media sites have taken aggressive actions to silence conservative voices such as ourselves by deliberately reshaping and weaponizing our page with algorithms that censor and suppress our free speech.
[02:02:41.712 --> 02:02:50.314]  Next it was YouTube who let conservative influencers build up an audience for years only to end up limiting their channels temporarily.
[02:02:50.474 --> 02:02:51.795]  Pause, back that up ten seconds.
[02:02:52.155 --> 02:02:52.595]  That's key.
[02:02:53.971 --> 02:02:56.553]  Everyone advertises on their big syndicated radio shows.
[02:02:56.713 --> 02:02:58.314]  Everyone advertises on their TV shows.
[02:02:58.374 --> 02:03:01.896]  Everyone advertises if you're small business or in your newspaper ad.
[02:03:01.956 --> 02:03:03.497]  For years, you built them up.
[02:03:04.317 --> 02:03:05.518]  You create the content.
[02:03:05.998 --> 02:03:07.139]  You send people there.
[02:03:07.479 --> 02:03:08.659]  They get it all built.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:13.042]  Then they go... Some SJW said you were a Nazi.
[02:03:13.242 --> 02:03:16.044]  Your 35,000 videos and 2.5 billion views are gone.
[02:03:19.138 --> 02:03:24.221]  And I'm like, the only thing I really miss is like, God, there's some footage of my dog that's dead, my grandma that's dead on there.
[02:03:25.102 --> 02:03:26.503]  I should have saved that and downloaded it.
[02:03:28.324 --> 02:03:32.987]  But I mean, just the vandals, the anti-free speech monsters.
[02:03:33.928 --> 02:03:39.692]  And then they sit there and act like we're the monsters, when they're funded by a Nazi collaborator.
[02:03:40.172 --> 02:03:41.793]  D'Souza joins us tomorrow, by the way.
[02:03:42.494 --> 02:03:44.495]  The film was about the Nazi sorrows.
[02:03:45.196 --> 02:03:47.397]  Ah, you didn't shut that down, did you, my pretty?
[02:03:47.737 --> 02:03:48.198]  Continue.
[02:03:49.170 --> 02:04:00.934]  Next it was YouTube, who let conservative influencers build up an audience for years, only to end up limiting their channels, temporarily demonetizing them, with no warning at all!
[02:04:02.254 --> 02:04:07.756]  This has happened to conservative commentators like Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, and Dennis Prager.
[02:04:08.916 --> 02:04:15.018]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[02:04:16.024 --> 02:04:19.766]  Just look at what's happened to conservative speakers on college campuses.
[02:04:20.947 --> 02:04:25.029]  And after liberal radio hosts flopped on Air America, remember them?
[02:04:25.049 --> 02:04:31.653]  Well, some Democrats sought to revive the Fairness Doctrine to snuff out conservative talk radio.
[02:04:32.374 --> 02:04:33.775]  Thankfully, that went nowhere.
[02:04:35.077 --> 02:04:41.820]  We'll come back with more and special guests, but Mike Cernovich, Vox Day and others, but it didn't flop.
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:44.621]  They go after your sponsors, they harass you, they do all this crap.
[02:04:44.742 --> 02:04:48.783]  The reason I know all about this is I've been enjoying it for 24 years.
[02:04:49.404 --> 02:04:51.865]  I've been dealing with every level of censorship there is.
[02:04:51.885 --> 02:04:54.186]  There's nothing like practice to make you a master.
[02:04:54.506 --> 02:04:57.587]  And I know exactly every trick they got up their stinking sleeve.
[02:04:57.948 --> 02:04:58.588]  More than they do.
[02:05:01.482 --> 02:05:05.184]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:05:05.325 --> 02:05:10.388]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[02:05:10.548 --> 02:05:11.729]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:11.869 --> 02:05:13.490]  It is absolutely free.
[02:05:13.710 --> 02:05:18.673]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[02:05:18.914 --> 02:05:22.556]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:05:22.676 --> 02:05:26.779]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[02:05:26.999 --> 02:05:31.102]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:05:34.843 --> 02:05:35.863]  Hey, have you heard?
[02:05:36.324 --> 02:05:38.384]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[02:05:38.484 --> 02:05:39.785]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[02:05:39.945 --> 02:05:40.985]  They're all censoring us.
[02:05:41.365 --> 02:05:47.247]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[02:05:47.567 --> 02:05:50.588]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[02:06:12.401 --> 02:06:17.147]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:20.452 --> 02:06:22.534]  Alright, I wanted to get Vox Dei on.
[02:06:23.988 --> 02:06:25.789]  And then I may even do the fourth hour and take calls.
[02:06:25.809 --> 02:06:30.251]  I really want to take your calls, your take on the mass censorship that's happening, and the censorship war going into high gear.
[02:06:30.611 --> 02:06:39.896]  Fox Day, filmmaker, author, libertarian, conservative, nationalist, comic book maker, got his second issue out, already gone to number one.
[02:06:39.916 --> 02:06:44.618]  I wanted to get him on to talk about how he was banned nine months ago on Twitter.
[02:06:45.599 --> 02:06:53.423]  Now, Dorsey banned Milo a couple years ago, or during the campaign, I guess about two years ago, back in July of 2016, so I guess two years ago.
[02:06:54.764 --> 02:07:01.848]  And now we've seen all this unfold and accelerate, so why is Jack Dorsey now saying Jones hasn't violated his rules?
[02:07:01.908 --> 02:07:03.308]  Is it like Zuckerberg two weeks ago?
[02:07:03.408 --> 02:07:06.670]  Oh, Jones hadn't violated the rules, and then, oh, we did find he did.
[02:07:06.710 --> 02:07:09.652]  Is this some legalese game?
[02:07:10.852 --> 02:07:14.114]  But I gotta tell you, you've got CNN lobbying right now.
[02:07:15.435 --> 02:07:17.035]  Just type it in to search engine.
[02:07:19.875 --> 02:07:20.996]  Delete Jones's apps.
[02:07:21.777 --> 02:07:23.258]  We launched a new app three weeks ago.
[02:07:23.298 --> 02:07:24.238]  I figured this was coming.
[02:07:24.258 --> 02:07:26.080]  And I said, we got some old apps, four or five years old.
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:28.202]  I said, I want a big new badass app.
[02:07:28.482 --> 02:07:29.603]  Six months ago, I said, build it.
[02:07:30.902 --> 02:07:37.428]  Because I think they're going to ban us, and I think we can push an app to number one, I foresaw this, and then they'll ban that too.
[02:07:37.528 --> 02:07:47.999]  But the power to a jury of being number one, and then just having your phone book address, just how they get to you banned, when you pay for it, you put it into the store, we're now number one.
[02:07:48.079 --> 02:07:50.861]  We were number three earlier, we're now number one on news.
[02:07:52.265 --> 02:07:57.049]  On Android and on the whole Apple iTunes system.
[02:07:57.449 --> 02:08:01.313]  Now they've delisted us from iTunes to get our podcast, but the apps are still there.
[02:08:01.653 --> 02:08:02.934]  So he launched this three weeks ago.
[02:08:02.954 --> 02:08:04.015]  This all started a week ago.
[02:08:04.335 --> 02:08:07.438]  It's now number one, 4.9 stars, and
[02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:16.911]  We have got millions of people to sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and we'll be getting to you soon.
[02:08:17.371 --> 02:08:18.432]  MailChimp banned us.
[02:08:19.012 --> 02:08:20.012]  Discuss banned us.
[02:08:20.452 --> 02:08:22.373]  More than 15 platforms banned us.
[02:08:23.033 --> 02:08:25.774]  I've got lawyers saying, no, you have clear racketeering.
[02:08:26.014 --> 02:08:31.036]  Like top ones, top, you know, like we're talking deans of law schools are calling saying, okay, we want the suit.
[02:08:31.356 --> 02:08:32.377]  We can't believe they did this.
[02:08:32.457 --> 02:08:35.578]  In the Trump derangement syndrome, the fact that they did all this.
[02:08:35.618 --> 02:08:38.939]  So I want to ask Vox Dei, he'll ride shotgun with us with Mike Cernovich coming up.
[02:08:39.859 --> 02:08:41.280]  What do you think's happening?
[02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:43.761]  Was this Trump derangement syndrome?
[02:08:44.121 --> 02:08:45.442]  I mean, why are they getting so scared?
[02:08:45.462 --> 02:08:47.022]  They just lost these special elections.
[02:08:47.502 --> 02:08:48.363]  What are they doing?
[02:08:48.403 --> 02:08:51.144]  Because it seems like now they went too far.
[02:08:51.424 --> 02:08:58.247]  They demonized me as a straw man, used me as the test case to ban certain people and deplatform them and unperson them.
[02:08:58.647 --> 02:09:00.868]  That's now, everyone's unifying against it now.
[02:09:01.229 --> 02:09:02.689]  We're getting record traffic now.
[02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:05.991]  They are crippling the sites and attacking us, but we'll fix that.
[02:09:06.351 --> 02:09:08.432]  I mean, I really think they've misstepped again.
[02:09:08.452 --> 02:09:08.912]  What do you think?
[02:09:10.689 --> 02:09:11.610]  I think they're desperate.
[02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:28.962]  I think that they know they're running out of time and they're taking whatever actions they can as quickly as possible in order to shut down the voices of the right that are most influential before the midterm elections.
[02:09:32.565 --> 02:09:33.165]  I agree with you.
[02:09:33.205 --> 02:09:34.306]  So what comes next?
[02:09:36.708 --> 02:09:38.549]  What comes next is the defunding.
[02:09:39.429 --> 02:09:45.272]  First, you have the deplatforming, and then they're going to go after the monetization.
[02:09:46.013 --> 02:09:58.420]  They're going to go after payment processors, credit card companies, banks, try to limit the ability of your supporters to provide you with money.
[02:09:59.266 --> 02:10:01.567]  Which is beyond racketeering.
[02:10:01.607 --> 02:10:02.968]  I mean, that's what the lawyers say.
[02:10:03.268 --> 02:10:05.390]  This is so illegal, but they're desperate.
[02:10:05.710 --> 02:10:07.491]  They think they can pay out lawsuits.
[02:10:07.571 --> 02:10:08.532]  The decision's been made.
[02:10:09.012 --> 02:10:11.413]  Even when they lose, which they will, so they're going to do this.
[02:10:13.615 --> 02:10:14.495]  Well, there's no question.
[02:10:14.595 --> 02:10:23.381]  I don't think that they have much choice because most of these companies are propped up on some level by the deep state.
[02:10:24.862 --> 02:10:27.103]  If you look at the $600 million contract
[02:10:29.002 --> 02:10:31.884]  That the CIA gave to Amazon.
[02:10:33.585 --> 02:10:45.872]  What a lot of people don't realize is that Twitter and Facebook and Google, possibly, have been benefiting from similar contracts.
[02:10:45.912 --> 02:10:48.334]  They just were not as smart as Jeff Bezos.
[02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:49.614]  Well, let's go further.
[02:10:49.634 --> 02:10:56.919]  I've been told by high-level former CIA section chiefs, and I confirmed it, Google is NASA and some other agency.
[02:10:59.993 --> 02:11:00.454]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:11:01.335 --> 02:11:02.036]  I'm not surprised.
[02:11:02.536 --> 02:11:05.780]  But Bezos did it openly.
[02:11:07.161 --> 02:11:11.306]  He is a better businessman than these other guys.
[02:11:12.127 --> 02:11:13.508]  And he's actually interested in
[02:11:14.822 --> 02:11:15.583]  Business as well.
[02:11:16.424 --> 02:11:24.591]  And so that's why Amazon doesn't leap into the banning and the censoring with the same enthusiasm that the others do.
[02:11:25.272 --> 02:11:25.872]  I agree with you.
[02:11:26.513 --> 02:11:28.235]  We know that Dorsey's part controlled by that.
[02:11:28.555 --> 02:11:30.917]  Why is Dorsey saying no when he banned you?
[02:11:33.479 --> 02:11:37.123]  Well, I think that they're circling the drain.
[02:11:38.875 --> 02:11:41.916]  Twitter went way too far too early.
[02:11:41.956 --> 02:11:46.217]  If you think about it, they were really the first to start this whole wave of banning.
[02:11:47.077 --> 02:11:56.679]  You know, they're so out of control, they didn't merely ban me, they ended up banning my wife, who's not political at all.
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:05.622]  But she still managed to get herself banned after getting into a discussion with some crazy vegan woman who was stalking her.
[02:12:06.982 --> 02:12:07.282]  And so,
[02:12:09.198 --> 02:12:15.483]  Twitter, I think, is trying to dig themselves out because they've lost so many users.
[02:12:15.943 --> 02:12:18.605]  They've lost us, you know, so many accounts.
[02:12:18.725 --> 02:12:20.486]  They don't have the growth anymore.
[02:12:21.147 --> 02:12:25.710]  And unlike Amazon and unlike Apple, they don't actually make any money.
[02:12:27.588 --> 02:12:30.250]  That's right, and you hit on something.
[02:12:30.750 --> 02:12:45.282]  They've had the New York Times, and they've had some people record them, and the Washington Post and BuzzFeed and all the regular suspects calling people and they say, we'll give you a big profile and say how great you are if you tell us bad things about Alex Jones.
[02:12:46.275 --> 02:12:48.957]  And that's like a weird currency they've got, even though it's worthless.
[02:12:49.317 --> 02:12:52.560]  And it's the same thing like, oh, even some vegan lady.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:55.342]  You're a leftist, so you can get a woman banned.
[02:12:55.702 --> 02:13:02.947]  There's no real money or energy or energon cubes or no seeds or no, you know, pork steak or beef steak.
[02:13:03.448 --> 02:13:05.689]  It's all just scalping someone.
[02:13:05.729 --> 02:13:09.592]  The left is all now about power to control someone.
[02:13:09.612 --> 02:13:12.694]  It is the most maniacal authoritarian thing I could imagine.
[02:13:13.114 --> 02:13:14.936]  It's literally the archetype of a villain.
[02:13:16.826 --> 02:13:18.787]  Well, actually, that's my PR plan.
[02:13:18.907 --> 02:13:27.031]  You know, I've had a lot of trouble with the New York Times and other mainstream media pieces doing hit pieces on me.
[02:13:27.111 --> 02:13:34.275]  So I figure a few more appearances here on Alex Jones and then I'll be able to say, hey, look, I've got all this dirt on Alex Jones.
[02:13:34.315 --> 02:13:36.176]  Maybe you should do a nice piece about me for a change.
[02:13:37.329 --> 02:13:43.931]  But you know the weird thing about a nice piece, I told Politico right when Rand Paul won like four years ago, I said, you know how you'd beat Rand Paul?
[02:13:44.691 --> 02:13:45.891]  Is you would endorse him.
[02:13:46.232 --> 02:13:48.232]  And they laughed, they put that in there, they didn't get it.
[02:13:48.312 --> 02:13:51.973]  Like, you know, Vox, a New York Times piece endorsing you would be the end of you.
[02:13:52.413 --> 02:13:53.494]  But they can't even do it.
[02:13:53.534 --> 02:13:57.255]  They don't even get the Machiavellian thing that if they endorsed us, it would kill us.
[02:13:57.615 --> 02:13:59.115]  They're so delusional, man.
[02:14:00.015 --> 02:14:01.096]  They're such followers.
[02:14:02.136 --> 02:14:05.337]  Well, I thought it was funny that they thought that anointing
[02:14:06.423 --> 02:14:15.972]  Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris as the official New York Times approved opposition was somehow going to help those guys.
[02:14:16.393 --> 02:14:19.616]  I mean, even people who are fans of Shapiro and Peterson.
[02:14:19.636 --> 02:14:21.758]  Everyone turned against him when it became obvious.
[02:14:23.019 --> 02:14:23.460]  Exactly.
[02:14:25.682 --> 02:14:27.724]  We're going to break here, but then what comes next, Fox?
[02:14:27.764 --> 02:14:28.605]  What are they going to do next?
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:35.583]  What they're going to do next is they're going to go after the lesser lights.
[02:14:35.923 --> 02:14:45.808]  You know, I fully expect people like me, people like Jack Posobiec, people like Cernovich, I expect that we're going to start getting targeted as well.
[02:14:45.828 --> 02:14:47.209]  I agree with that.
[02:14:47.269 --> 02:14:50.951]  I think I know the attack on me is the cover for everybody else getting banned.
[02:14:52.812 --> 02:14:53.492]  There's no question.
[02:14:53.532 --> 02:15:00.096]  In fact, I already went ahead and deleted my Facebook pages and my Facebook account just because I figured
[02:15:00.774 --> 02:15:09.656]  You know, if they're going to ban significant figures like Alex Jones, then there's absolutely no point in my making any attempt to build up a platform on Facebook.
[02:15:11.137 --> 02:15:12.117]  And that's the problem.
[02:15:12.397 --> 02:15:15.738]  They're signaling that we're not welcome when we're the people that actually produce.
[02:15:16.198 --> 02:15:20.840]  Why do you think their stock at Twitter and Facebook has plunged 30% the last month?
[02:15:23.060 --> 02:15:29.242]  Because it's been clear that the Trump administration is not going to permit them to be propped up anymore.
[02:15:34.654 --> 02:15:35.175]  That's your right.
[02:15:35.635 --> 02:15:36.036]  Right again.
[02:15:36.076 --> 02:15:37.417]  Vox Dei, what do we do then?
[02:15:37.477 --> 02:15:38.198]  What does Trump do?
[02:15:38.218 --> 02:15:39.779]  Because I'm not bragging here.
[02:15:39.839 --> 02:15:43.523]  I literally get asked by people very close to the president, like, write a report.
[02:15:43.583 --> 02:15:46.105]  What do we, I mean, I'm like, Jesus, I mean, I'm not that smart.
[02:15:46.386 --> 02:15:47.467]  You guys have this figured out.
[02:15:47.787 --> 02:15:48.788]  But I mean, I'm not bragging.
[02:15:49.308 --> 02:15:51.090]  Fine, we'll tell you right now what we think you ought to do.
[02:15:51.450 --> 02:15:53.653]  What should Trump do about the web censorship purge?
[02:15:54.253 --> 02:15:56.415]  That's what we're going to cover on the other side of Vox Dei.
[02:15:56.615 --> 02:15:58.958]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:16:00.825 --> 02:16:14.419]  I told you that we could retake America if you believed in capitalism, if you believed in freedom, if you believed in God, if you believed that you had some control over your destiny.
[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:15.880]  And now we're here.
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:23.584]  As we're in the hottest part of the summer, going into the fall, the left is calling for civil war, total censorship of Infowars.
[02:16:23.824 --> 02:16:31.869]  They're lying about the president more than more, calling for violence against him, calling for him to be removed, calling for his family to be kidnapped, murdered, tortured.
[02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:33.149]  It's everywhere.
[02:16:33.690 --> 02:16:38.032]  And then Trump says, mainstream media is the enemy of the American people.
[02:16:38.052 --> 02:16:42.775]  When they're fake news and lying, they go, oh my God, you're going to cause us to get hurt.
[02:16:43.175 --> 02:16:50.559]  You've got Democrat candidates in Kentucky making jokes and saying, hey, Rand Paul can be beaten for the Senate race.
[02:16:50.879 --> 02:16:51.860]  Look at what his neighbor did.
[02:16:52.420 --> 02:16:53.000]  It's everywhere.
[02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:54.881]  If I try to list it all, it'd take an hour.
[02:16:55.281 --> 02:16:57.383]  They're trying to bully us into submission.
[02:16:58.523 --> 02:17:06.306]  So now more than ever with them all over the news saying de-platform us and lying about what we stand for and filing all these frivolous fake lawsuits that we're getting thrown out.
[02:17:06.966 --> 02:17:08.347]  This is the critical battle.
[02:17:08.587 --> 02:17:10.147]  Getting Trump in was just the beachhead.
[02:17:10.567 --> 02:17:12.868]  Now the real fight for liberty begins.
[02:17:13.248 --> 02:17:14.969]  We're entering the season of false flags.
[02:17:16.258 --> 02:17:22.883]  Uh, where the mainstream media knows it has no viewers, knows that it's basically now just corporate engines of censorship, just like the colleges.
[02:17:23.384 --> 02:17:32.211]  And so, they're putting out the breadcrumbs out there, clearly having their own people, in my view, calling into C-SPAN and, you know, calling for CNN to get shot.
[02:17:33.717 --> 02:17:34.879]  I've been telling you that's coming.
[02:17:35.199 --> 02:17:42.890]  So we need to stop the violence, we need to say no violence, we need to decry violence, so that when and if they stage events, people see through it.
[02:17:43.891 --> 02:17:47.596]  I came out the day the drone attack happened in Venezuela.
[02:17:48.479 --> 02:17:52.001]  Before any other media picks it up and I said, I don't hear any explosions, I don't see any smoke.
[02:17:52.321 --> 02:17:54.322]  This looks totally staged in the video I see.
[02:17:54.582 --> 02:17:59.064]  And now even our own government and foreign governments are saying it appears to be a false flag.
[02:17:59.784 --> 02:18:01.245]  False flags do happen.
[02:18:01.305 --> 02:18:02.686]  Some things are real, obviously.
[02:18:03.206 --> 02:18:04.747]  But communists and scumbags
[02:18:05.447 --> 02:18:09.309]  Like a dictator of Venezuela who has staged elections, I believe has staged this.
[02:18:09.769 --> 02:18:16.773]  So don't think the Democrats, who are totally desperate, won't pull that card of victim when they're building it up, building it up, building it up.
[02:18:16.994 --> 02:18:32.883]  How many months have I been saying we're entering the false flag area, where CNN or MSNBC or these other terrorist organizations against America that terrorize the truth, that lobby for the end of free speech, that lobby for their competitors to be taken off the air, that send out the reporters to stalk people and harass them.
[02:18:33.823 --> 02:18:39.268]  They're murderers and assassins of truth, and don't think their bosses aren't willing to go all the way.
[02:18:40.289 --> 02:18:44.253]  With that said, there is a way to defeat them and stand against their attempts to shut us down.
[02:18:44.533 --> 02:18:50.478]  Spread the articles, spread the videos, tell people in person about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:18:50.698 --> 02:18:53.461]  Download the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:18:53.921 --> 02:18:54.402]  I think so.
[02:19:14.662 --> 02:19:27.870]  If you take the challenge at Infowarslife.com and get things that everybody needs like high quality krill oil, fish oil, honor roll for kids, the very best, highest quality, and learn about all the amazing things it does, that funds our operation.
[02:19:28.110 --> 02:19:33.654]  If you sign up for auto ship, get an additional 10% off that way each month, or every two months, whatever you sign up for.
[02:19:33.914 --> 02:19:34.675]  Cancel any time.
[02:19:35.595 --> 02:19:37.737]  continues to fund it so you don't have to worry about it.
[02:19:38.017 --> 02:19:41.159]  You can get it done and know that you're tithing to the truth.
[02:19:41.199 --> 02:19:42.340]  You're tithing to your future.
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:50.505]  You're tithing against tyranny for liberty to an operation that you know has the enemy absolutely insanely mad.
[02:19:51.025 --> 02:19:53.247]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the InfoWar.
[02:19:53.567 --> 02:19:54.648]  Now it's up to you!
[02:20:03.473 --> 02:20:09.715]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.979 --> 02:20:24.021]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:27.042 --> 02:20:29.343]  There must be some way out of here.
[02:20:30.783 --> 02:20:32.004]  Said the Joker to the thief,
[02:20:34.628 --> 02:20:42.622]  All right, best-selling author Vox Dei.
[02:20:43.543 --> 02:20:46.128]  Patriot is our guest here, voxdei.blogspot.com.
[02:20:49.366 --> 02:20:50.427]  I asked the question before the break.
[02:20:50.667 --> 02:20:51.929]  What does Trump need to do?
[02:20:51.989 --> 02:20:54.131]  Because I'm not on some power trip.
[02:20:54.592 --> 02:20:59.036]  I'm talking to high-level people and they say, like, you know, a year ago, what's shadow banning?
[02:20:59.116 --> 02:21:07.245]  Or wait, or they're... And I'm trying to explain, like, you know, Google's really run by the CIA and the NASA and here's the, here's, here's, here's...
[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:13.982]  When they got founded 17 years ago, here's the In-To-Tell documents, and here's a link to the National Archives.
[02:21:14.002 --> 02:21:14.642]  They're like, really?
[02:21:14.722 --> 02:21:15.382]  God Almighty!
[02:21:15.902 --> 02:21:22.984]  Yet, as you know, they're merging with China, and then Apple's moved over there and give them all the code keys, and there's Chinese spies everywhere, and that Dianne Feinstein's run by them.
[02:21:23.204 --> 02:21:31.427]  I mean, let me just tell you, two weeks ago, I'm on the phone with people at the Pentagon at CENTCOM, and I'm like, Dianne Feinstein is a Chinese agent.
[02:21:31.867 --> 02:21:32.607]  They don't even hide it.
[02:21:32.967 --> 02:21:33.767]  Now you see it in the news.
[02:21:33.807 --> 02:21:35.248]  So the real reason they're pissed at me is,
[02:21:36.437 --> 02:21:38.821]  I do open source research, and I have sources.
[02:21:38.881 --> 02:21:43.288]  So, I told people on Friday, Dianne Feinstein is going down as a shycom, it was in the news Sunday.
[02:21:43.549 --> 02:21:44.250]  I'm not bragging!
[02:21:44.430 --> 02:21:45.312]  I'm not that smart!
[02:21:45.732 --> 02:21:50.039]  So I'm sick of doing all the work, only in that, Vox, I'm scared because
[02:21:51.277 --> 02:21:51.958]  We have them.
[02:21:51.998 --> 02:21:53.099]  We have their ass.
[02:21:53.259 --> 02:21:55.341]  If people just... They are censoring the internet.
[02:21:55.381 --> 02:21:56.522]  They are blocking conservatives.
[02:21:56.702 --> 02:21:58.343]  They're trying to block the economy coming back.
[02:21:59.604 --> 02:22:04.609]  Jerks like Bill Maher saying, I want a depression to teach Americans to come to heel.
[02:22:04.969 --> 02:22:06.070]  Well, screw you, man!
[02:22:06.090 --> 02:22:08.512]  You're not going to F my family over.
[02:22:08.592 --> 02:22:10.014]  We have these people.
[02:22:10.414 --> 02:22:11.955]  We have them in the censorship.
[02:22:11.975 --> 02:22:13.356]  We have them in espionage.
[02:22:13.577 --> 02:22:14.698]  And we have to do it.
[02:22:14.958 --> 02:22:18.341]  Not because we want power, but because we don't want these people running our lives.
[02:22:18.621 --> 02:22:32.608]  So I'm ranting, I'm asking you as somebody banned by Twitter, as this whole thing coming down, what does Trump and Congress and our listeners and me, in your view, what do we do before they steal this election by rigging everything and by taking the internet over in the next three months?
[02:22:32.668 --> 02:22:33.168]  What do we do?
[02:22:33.188 --> 02:22:39.151]  Because now is critical, and I gambled everything, and I pushed them into this position, and it's happened again.
[02:22:39.271 --> 02:22:47.676]  Yet again, what I envisioned happened, but I am now envisioning if we don't press the attack and get this front and center to the President, and if he doesn't take action,
[02:22:48.456 --> 02:22:49.677]  We are going to lose.
[02:22:49.918 --> 02:23:06.014]  I agree the enemy's panicked, but sometimes there's an energy like one of the famous, I forget his name, Lord whatever in Japan said the way of the Jedi, you know, the way of, which they're copying, the way of the samurai is, is, is, what's the exact quote?
[02:23:06.054 --> 02:23:11.060]  The way of a samurai is recklessness and a hundred men can't beat such a man.
[02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:11.340]  Do you guys
[02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:18.782]  I just looked it up, The Way of the Samurai's Recklessness, and I actually get, but it's not that you're being reckless, it's that you're going with your gut and your spirit, that's when you're unstoppable.
[02:23:19.022 --> 02:23:23.324]  So if we don't go with the recklessness, I think we're going to at least have a civil war.
[02:23:23.364 --> 02:23:25.644]  We win, but my God, I don't want to go there.
[02:23:25.685 --> 02:23:26.805]  I see, choose your adventure.
[02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:28.966]  They win, that's probably not going to happen, I agree with you.
[02:23:29.646 --> 02:23:35.007]  We have a giant long protracted situation that can turn into a new world war, that's happening.
[02:23:35.908 --> 02:23:39.349]  Or us winning is so easy if we take destiny in our hands.
[02:23:39.389 --> 02:23:39.669]  Go ahead.
[02:23:41.687 --> 02:24:01.314]  Well, I think that a lot of us are hoping that there is something to the whole QAnon thing with regards to the prosecution of the conspirators and the criminals who have been attempting to subvert the government of the United States.
[02:24:02.735 --> 02:24:10.958]  Certainly, there is some reason to be optimistic on that score, regardless of whether the stuff reported by Q is literally true or not.
[02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:20.544]  But with regards to what we can do personally, what we have to do is we have to stop supporting the enemy.
[02:24:20.564 --> 02:24:32.330]  You know, I didn't mind at all when I got kicked off of Twitter, even though I had, I don't know, 33,000 followers or something, because I had largely stopped using it.
[02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:35.091]  I didn't want to support them anymore.
[02:24:35.131 --> 02:24:36.732]  I didn't want to bring them my traffic, etc.
[02:24:40.192 --> 02:24:47.914]  What people need to do is they need to start giving up the addiction to the left's controlled social media.
[02:24:48.674 --> 02:24:59.236]  That means, you know, every person that leaves Facebook causes other people to consider leaving Facebook because they can no longer interact with you there.
[02:25:00.356 --> 02:25:09.418]  And the sooner that we reduce Facebook and Twitter to nothing more than a bunch of lefties attacking people who are posting cat pictures,
[02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:12.581]  The more likely it is that we're going to win.
[02:25:12.861 --> 02:25:21.684]  Now, I believe that we're going to win the midterm elections and that we're going to win the 2020 presidential election no matter what they do.
[02:25:23.085 --> 02:25:24.865]  There is not going to be a blue wave.
[02:25:25.105 --> 02:25:26.426]  I've said that many times.
[02:25:26.446 --> 02:25:30.987]  I wasn't surprised that the Republicans hung on to these seats that they were supposed to lose.
[02:25:32.408 --> 02:25:38.070]  I think that you're going to see even more insanity out of the left after
[02:25:39.091 --> 02:25:42.134]  The blue wave fails to appear in November 2018.
[02:25:43.115 --> 02:25:55.547]  But the main thing that people like you and me and and Cernovich and Posobiec and other people who have followings, whether they're large or small, is that we need to build our own platforms.
[02:25:56.228 --> 02:26:02.474]  You know, we've built Infogalactic, which is a very good alternative, a superior alternative to Wikipedia.
[02:26:03.641 --> 02:26:05.023]  We need people to start using that.
[02:26:05.083 --> 02:26:06.344]  We need people to start editing it.
[02:26:06.804 --> 02:26:09.427]  Wikipedia is controlled by only 500 people.
[02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:17.055]  We don't need that many people in order to become the dominant information content provider on the Internet.
[02:26:18.476 --> 02:26:23.862]  The same thing is true of sites like Twitter, sites like Facebook.
[02:26:25.695 --> 02:26:30.199]  It doesn't take that many people to get the trend moving in the positive direction.
[02:26:30.740 --> 02:26:46.834]  And so the more that we see people moving to sites like Infogalactic, to sites like Oneway.com, the more you're going to see people reducing the power of Facebook and Twitter and other social media platforms.
[02:26:46.874 --> 02:26:52.239]  The one problem is YouTube, because YouTube is run at such a loss
[02:26:53.197 --> 02:26:55.458]  That almost no one but Google could afford it.
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:26:58.761]  Well, you're right.
[02:26:58.781 --> 02:26:59.681]  I was misquoting it.
[02:26:59.701 --> 02:27:03.083]  It was the way of the samurai is, is desperation.
[02:27:03.183 --> 02:27:04.364]  It's the same thing as recklessness.
[02:27:04.484 --> 02:27:08.567]  All I'm saying is, literally, we can beat these people.
[02:27:08.667 --> 02:27:12.169]  No one takes the field because the average conservative or Christian is so humble.
[02:27:12.489 --> 02:27:13.070]  And that's great.
[02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:15.411]  But we cannot just sit here and
[02:27:18.644 --> 02:27:19.625]  I don't want to run things.
[02:27:19.725 --> 02:27:20.525]  I don't want to be in charge.
[02:27:20.545 --> 02:27:26.489]  But I'm not going to have people that are trying to sexualize my kids or put deadly vaccines in me that they admit are killing people.
[02:27:26.549 --> 02:27:27.650]  I'm just not going to do it.
[02:27:27.730 --> 02:27:29.070]  So now I'm all in.
[02:27:30.822 --> 02:27:37.924]  I just realized that I don't know what it is about these evil mental midgets that get power and convalesce together that then want to run our lives.
[02:27:38.044 --> 02:27:38.664]  I just know this.
[02:27:38.704 --> 02:27:39.825]  They need to get off our backs.
[02:27:39.865 --> 02:27:43.606]  And I think this thing that Jack Dorsey is backing off now, I agree.
[02:27:43.686 --> 02:27:45.446]  He was the vanguard of censorship.
[02:27:45.787 --> 02:27:48.467]  Trump sends one tweet that what he's doing is illegal.
[02:27:48.487 --> 02:27:49.228]  He backs off.
[02:27:49.728 --> 02:27:52.729]  So the message to Republicans and people is get on it.
[02:27:52.829 --> 02:27:53.449]  Get upset.
[02:27:53.469 --> 02:27:54.489]  Have emergency hearings.
[02:27:54.549 --> 02:27:55.489]  We can stop this.
[02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:58.190]  Instead of sitting there going, you're a private company.
[02:27:58.210 --> 02:27:59.091]  You can do whatever you want.
[02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:00.211]  No.
[02:28:01.417 --> 02:28:13.144]  You're utilities that held things out, that let people advertise and build you up, and now you're letting Democrats do whatever they want, and not letting other people do it before, just like blacks, not letting them vote in the Deep South during the 1950s and 60s.
[02:28:13.444 --> 02:28:14.425]  This is outrageous!
[02:28:16.486 --> 02:28:22.549]  Well, it is outrageous, and my response to this sort of thing is, bake the cake.
[02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:25.671]  You know, the rules have changed.
[02:28:26.031 --> 02:28:30.434]  The whole idea that a corporation can do whatever it wants has been
[02:28:32.253 --> 02:28:33.694]  Strictly limited legally.
[02:28:34.154 --> 02:28:35.054]  It's no longer true.
[02:28:35.595 --> 02:28:45.899]  And so, Republicans need to stop crying about the fact that things have changed and start playing by the new rules in order to start winning by them.
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:47.960]  That's right, and these are monopolies.
[02:28:48.321 --> 02:28:50.422]  So you don't get on your telephone and somebody censors it.
[02:28:51.362 --> 02:28:52.403]  Okay, they don't do that.
[02:28:52.423 --> 02:28:54.483]  We'll be right back with Vox Day, Mike Sherman, some more.
[02:28:54.764 --> 02:28:55.964]  Newswars.com.
[02:28:56.044 --> 02:28:57.225]  Newswars.com.
[02:29:01.036 --> 02:29:05.362]  All these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it.
[02:29:05.462 --> 02:29:08.967]  So I'm here hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering.
[02:29:08.987 --> 02:29:10.228]  Stop the hammering.
[02:29:10.689 --> 02:29:12.171]  Stop the hammering out there.
[02:29:12.191 --> 02:29:13.032]  Who's got a hammer?
[02:29:13.312 --> 02:29:13.773]  Where is it?
[02:29:14.153 --> 02:29:16.557]  Hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering.
[02:29:16.937 --> 02:29:17.818]  Where's the hammer?
[02:29:18.639 --> 02:29:20.480]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor!
[02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:22.722]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering!
[02:29:22.902 --> 02:29:23.363]  Hammering!
[02:29:23.563 --> 02:29:24.023]  Hammering!
[02:29:24.223 --> 02:29:24.664]  Hammering!
[02:29:24.884 --> 02:29:25.344]  Hammering!
[02:29:25.544 --> 02:29:25.985]  Hammering!
[02:29:26.305 --> 02:29:27.947]  Stop the hammering!
[02:29:28.467 --> 02:29:28.947]  Hammering!
[02:29:29.128 --> 02:29:29.568]  Hammering!
[02:29:29.788 --> 02:29:30.248]  Hammering!
[02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.889]  Hammering!
[02:29:31.069 --> 02:29:32.390]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin!
[02:29:32.410 --> 02:29:34.032]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call!
[02:29:34.172 --> 02:29:35.673]  Stop the hammering!
[02:29:35.953 --> 02:29:36.374]  Hammering!
[02:29:36.594 --> 02:29:36.974]  Hammering!
[02:29:37.755 --> 02:29:38.636]  And all these fools...
[02:29:39.795 --> 02:29:41.996]  And all these traders don't get it.
[02:29:42.556 --> 02:29:48.958]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[02:29:49.558 --> 02:29:51.598]  It just f***ing sucks.
[02:29:51.919 --> 02:29:56.180]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[02:29:56.880 --> 02:30:02.781]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control of everything.
[02:30:02.841 --> 02:30:03.201]  They're here.
[02:30:03.701 --> 02:30:06.602]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[02:30:06.662 --> 02:30:07.382]  That's what I know.
[02:30:08.062 --> 02:30:11.123]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.
[02:30:11.523 --> 02:30:17.124]  Our supplements, our products, our t-shirts, all of it is Choose Your Own Adventure at Infowarshore.com.
[02:30:17.424 --> 02:30:18.424]  Standing with America.
[02:30:18.604 --> 02:30:20.344]  Standing against the Chai-coms in Hollywood.
[02:30:20.584 --> 02:30:21.985]  Standing for victory and winning.
[02:30:22.185 --> 02:30:22.725]  Thanks to you.
[02:30:22.825 --> 02:30:23.285]  We'll be back.
[02:30:24.165 --> 02:30:27.227]  I'll go down to the g***** floor myself and stop it.
[02:30:27.267 --> 02:30:29.068]  Keep the g***** commercial break going.
[02:30:29.568 --> 02:30:33.270]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[02:31:16.007 --> 02:31:17.047]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:31:17.067 --> 02:31:18.947]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!

[02:31:42.215 --> 02:31:45.257]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.

[02:31:47.098 --> 02:31:48.119]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:48.139 --> 02:31:50.360]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:31:50.380 --> 02:31:50.621]  Go ahead.
[02:31:50.641 --> 02:31:53.062]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:31:53.162 --> 02:31:56.945]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:32:08.197 --> 02:32:09.298]  It just gets old, man.
[02:32:09.619 --> 02:32:11.360]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:32:12.061 --> 02:32:14.143]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:32:14.383 --> 02:32:18.367]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:32:18.387 --> 02:32:20.890]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:32:21.711 --> 02:32:24.033]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:32:24.393 --> 02:32:25.494]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:32:25.735 --> 02:32:26.615]  Us being shut down?
[02:32:26.856 --> 02:32:27.897]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:32:28.317 --> 02:32:29.357]  You know what, Alex?
[02:32:29.397 --> 02:32:30.478]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[02:32:30.498 --> 02:32:31.318]  Hey, Frank!
[02:32:31.598 --> 02:32:36.959]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:32:37.259 --> 02:32:41.540]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:44.641]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:32:44.921 --> 02:32:45.301]  You understand?
[02:32:45.381 --> 02:32:46.661]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:32:47.022 --> 02:32:48.182]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:32:49.142 --> 02:32:54.063]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[02:32:55.043 --> 02:32:55.704]  Do you understand?
[02:32:55.724 --> 02:32:56.904]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:33:04.375 --> 02:33:20.460]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:20.741 --> 02:33:27.703]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry
[02:33:33.556 --> 02:33:52.648]  You know I'm a big historian back when I had time because I stopped reading pulp fiction when I was about 10 or 11 and got into like science fiction I was about 14 then history after that because it was so much more interesting and there was so much history each page had battles wars you name it I remember reading a few books about Imperial Japan and feudal Japan before that
[02:33:53.592 --> 02:34:02.957]  I remember reading a quote, that I remember just a few years ago and found online, of Lord Naoshige, said, The way of the samurai is desperateness.
[02:34:03.638 --> 02:34:06.119]  Ten men or more cannot kill such a man.
[02:34:06.619 --> 02:34:08.561]  Common sense will not accomplish great things.
[02:34:08.941 --> 02:34:10.882]  Simply becoming insane and desperate.
[02:34:11.262 --> 02:34:15.945]  In the way of the samurai, if one uses discrimination, he will fall behind.
[02:34:16.485 --> 02:34:19.109]  Like Trump said, the deepest thing he ever did was start being shallow.
[02:34:19.710 --> 02:34:26.820]  One needs neither loyalty nor devotion, but simply to become desperate in the way loyalty and devotion are themselves within desperation.
[02:34:27.521 --> 02:34:32.388]  And I'm all intellectual until the fight starts.
[02:34:34.409 --> 02:34:41.233]  And I've learned to just go with the desperation of not wanting to be ruled by these evil people, and that always leads me to victory.
[02:34:41.513 --> 02:34:44.294]  When I overthink things and do everything, I'm now a follower.
[02:34:44.734 --> 02:34:47.696]  A leader has to be ready to put themselves in the position.
[02:34:48.917 --> 02:34:51.418]  And I've done some things the last few weeks that I did on purpose.
[02:34:51.878 --> 02:34:52.999]  Only told my father about it.
[02:34:54.045 --> 02:34:55.807]  And he's got the record of it.
[02:34:55.847 --> 02:34:58.529]  But the point is, is that I knew at a gut level it was right.
[02:34:58.909 --> 02:35:01.591]  Now I'm betting my native intellect against the globalists.
[02:35:01.711 --> 02:35:04.794]  I'm betting my subconscious and my ancestors against theirs.
[02:35:06.035 --> 02:35:07.135]  But Mike Cernovich is here.
[02:35:07.195 --> 02:35:09.417]  We'll also have Vox Day as a surprise for you.
[02:35:09.437 --> 02:35:10.078]  I'll go to him in a moment.
[02:35:12.281 --> 02:35:15.545]  I don't think we've won, but I think we're in the fight and have the initiative.
[02:35:16.205 --> 02:35:20.470]  And I believe this attack is the ground zero to set the precedent for everyone else.
[02:35:20.911 --> 02:35:24.795]  For a few days, folks were caught flat-footed, but I'm confident now, Mike Cernovich.
[02:35:25.236 --> 02:35:26.757]  We talked about this privately last week.
[02:35:27.418 --> 02:35:35.904]  I'm confident now that this, if seized by Trump and others, if they move, this is the big election issue and the election of freedom.
[02:35:35.984 --> 02:35:40.468]  And I think the censorship that's already been going on, we had to force it out in the open.
[02:35:40.808 --> 02:35:42.029]  I think we're looking at victory.
[02:35:43.090 --> 02:35:44.691]  Sometimes you're pessimistic, you're a smart guy.
[02:35:44.711 --> 02:35:46.532]  What do you think, Mike Cernovich?
[02:35:47.813 --> 02:35:51.156]  Well, the attacks are only going to intensify
[02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:57.967]  And the good news is that the enemy is emboldened in a way that you want them emboldened.
[02:35:57.987 --> 02:35:59.228]  They're becoming reckless now.
[02:35:59.268 --> 02:36:03.673]  They're becoming... They're not thinking through their next move.
[02:36:03.713 --> 02:36:05.575]  It's now just strict bloodlust.
[02:36:06.176 --> 02:36:10.921]  And there's two ways that you can always trigger a blunder by an enemy.
[02:36:11.061 --> 02:36:12.743]  One is you make them angry and rage.
[02:36:13.463 --> 02:36:20.108]  And two is you make them feel like they're winning and that you're about to be defeated because then they'll take reckless moves.
[02:36:20.128 --> 02:36:21.249]  It's a strategic retreat.
[02:36:21.289 --> 02:36:27.853]  So a lot of people noticed with me is that I pretended that I was depressed and hiding out and stuff.
[02:36:28.233 --> 02:36:30.015]  And then I came out with the James Gunn thing.
[02:36:30.255 --> 02:36:38.821]  And people, a friend of mine who actually understands these things, a very high level person in the Pentagon said, you just did what the Genghis Khan, the Mongols would do.
[02:36:39.594 --> 02:36:40.115]  And I got that.
[02:36:40.195 --> 02:36:41.176]  And I get what you're doing.
[02:36:41.196 --> 02:36:42.357]  Here's what I'm saying.
[02:36:42.377 --> 02:36:44.279]  You just mirrored what I was saying with a twist.
[02:37:00.177 --> 02:37:05.321]  Desperation is not arrogant lust for power and hate in a rage.
[02:37:05.821 --> 02:37:07.443]  Desperation is looking at your kids.
[02:37:07.843 --> 02:37:08.984]  You've got to get out of this situation.
[02:37:09.024 --> 02:37:10.945]  Your brain makes the right decision instinctively.
[02:37:10.965 --> 02:37:15.148]  I mean, do you agree with me or disagree that a lot of times I... I want to hear your real take on this.
[02:37:15.188 --> 02:37:16.029]  You talk about archetypes.
[02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:23.875]  I more and more go off my gut after I've done the research and I just make a prime approximation and go with it because if I overanalyze, it may fail.
[02:37:23.895 --> 02:37:25.737]  When I go with gut, it seems to never fail.
[02:37:25.957 --> 02:37:26.837]  Do you get what I'm saying?
[02:37:26.877 --> 02:37:28.419]  How I made the choice
[02:37:29.699 --> 02:37:30.560]  To bring them out.
[02:37:32.121 --> 02:37:32.881]  Oh, I know.
[02:37:32.981 --> 02:37:34.022]  Well, so three things.
[02:37:34.422 --> 02:37:42.626]  One is that, in fact, there's a whole chapter in Gorilla Mindset about your gut and how your gut is referred by scientists as a second brain.
[02:37:42.646 --> 02:37:49.590]  75% of your serotonin and dopamine, those neurotransmitters are actually in your intestines.
[02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:51.091]  People think that's crazy.
[02:37:51.111 --> 02:37:52.932]  And then I say, well, no, no, it's been proven.
[02:37:52.972 --> 02:37:54.973]  We have a second brain in our spinal cord and our guts.
[02:37:56.192 --> 02:38:01.335]  Yeah, so it is there, but the samurai... Of course our brain's gonna want to know what we're eating.
[02:38:01.856 --> 02:38:03.416]  I mean, yeah, of course.
[02:38:04.357 --> 02:38:08.820]  Yeah, so literally your gut is your instincts.
[02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:19.987]  Now, what the samurais were talking about is the alignment of purpose and the alignment of your higher levels here and then the instinctual stuff that keeps you alive.
[02:38:20.047 --> 02:38:20.867]  Total commitment.
[02:38:20.907 --> 02:38:22.008]  You're talking about total commitment.
[02:38:22.887 --> 02:38:23.227]  Correct.
[02:38:23.267 --> 02:38:35.377]  Total Commitment, Singularity, I call it the Singularity of Focus, where you know that, and this of course was in the Haggard Courier, was written about also, where they said that a samurai is so committed to his purpose
[02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:43.917]  That he may be struck down, but he will take the enemy with him because he's so committed to that strike that he will take the enemy with him.
[02:38:44.277 --> 02:38:46.099]  So that is the singularity of purpose.
[02:38:46.119 --> 02:38:52.865]  The desperation spoken about in the samurai literature is a little different than... Mad rage!
[02:38:54.346 --> 02:38:55.627]  Lustful, controlling rage.
[02:38:55.748 --> 02:38:56.008]  I agree.
[02:38:56.738 --> 02:38:58.899]  Yeah, it doesn't mean that you're despondent.
[02:38:58.939 --> 02:39:02.401]  It's a very, very specific word lost in translation.
[02:39:02.501 --> 02:39:03.522]  No, I agree.
[02:39:03.582 --> 02:39:07.364]  Desperate means you're totally, I agree, your body's aligned in total commitment.
[02:39:08.385 --> 02:39:16.190]  Right, so for me, and you too, because I remember a year ago you told me that you were going to do this because I told you I wish that you wouldn't do it.
[02:39:16.210 --> 02:39:19.452]  We had a long conversation in person in Austin.
[02:39:19.492 --> 02:39:22.694]  Go ahead and tell the story then since you brought it up, then we'll get Vox Days a little present for you.
[02:39:22.714 --> 02:39:22.954]  Go ahead.
[02:39:23.689 --> 02:39:27.774]  Okay, so I was in, I came out in Austin for the Megyn Kelly thing.
[02:39:28.054 --> 02:39:30.898]  And I said, Alex, they're going to kill you.
[02:39:31.318 --> 02:39:32.380]  Here's what you have to do.
[02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:33.541]  You have to quit trolling.
[02:39:34.002 --> 02:39:39.588]  And I told him because that's the thing people always say, Oh, you know, you talk shit on Alex Jones, crap on Alex Jones.
[02:39:39.989 --> 02:39:40.630]  No, I do not.
[02:39:41.530 --> 02:39:43.871]  Man to man, I just said, I think you've got to quit trolling.
[02:39:44.951 --> 02:39:45.491]  Absolutely, 100%.
[02:39:46.292 --> 02:39:49.393]  And you said, actually, no, I'm not going to do that.
[02:39:49.413 --> 02:39:53.634]  I'm going to troll the media into even more traps, and I'm going to bring them out even more.
[02:39:53.674 --> 02:39:59.896]  And I said, OK, you know, reasonable people can disagree on the right approach here.
[02:40:00.636 --> 02:40:01.536]  And you did.
[02:40:02.076 --> 02:40:03.137]  And what you've done, though, is
[02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:09.311]  That's interesting, because what you've done is made the media lie.
[02:40:09.751 --> 02:40:10.532]  And here's what I mean.
[02:40:10.832 --> 02:40:14.913]  When I read the articles, they go, oh, Alex Jones threatened Mueller.
[02:40:14.973 --> 02:40:16.253]  I go, oh, crap.
[02:40:16.373 --> 02:40:16.994]  What happened?
[02:40:18.214 --> 02:40:19.194]  15 articles I read, Alex.
[02:40:19.274 --> 02:40:21.635]  I promise you, I went to Google News.
[02:40:21.655 --> 02:40:23.516]  15 articles said that you threatened him.
[02:40:23.896 --> 02:40:25.016]  None of them showed the video.
[02:40:26.445 --> 02:40:27.526]  None of them show the video.
[02:40:27.546 --> 02:40:31.507]  Then I watch the video and I go, wait, it was just like a Spaghetti Western sketch.
[02:40:32.067 --> 02:40:38.530]  So anybody who's actually committed now realizes, wow, that the media, they just lie about everything.
[02:40:38.550 --> 02:40:40.671]  And I knew they lied, so I didn't lie to get them to do it.
[02:40:40.771 --> 02:40:48.814]  I was honest, but I figured, I told my dad this, I said, this will trigger them with the total ban, which will then alert Trump and everybody else to make it an issue.
[02:40:48.854 --> 02:40:53.316]  At a gut level, I knew being desperate, being aligned in purpose,
[02:40:54.281 --> 02:40:56.602]  That it had to happen, and now it's worked, so.
[02:40:57.682 --> 02:40:59.783]  Well, and it had to be done in the open.
[02:40:59.823 --> 02:41:06.145]  I mean, the good thing about this is that they're murdering you in the open, which is better than the shadow bans.
[02:41:06.225 --> 02:41:10.426]  Now, a couple of things happened that were advantageous.
[02:41:11.486 --> 02:41:15.428]  One is that I had begun retweeting a lot of members of Congress recently.
[02:41:15.448 --> 02:41:20.969]  Let's come back from break and do that, but Vox Day, your good friend's riding a shotgun with us, and Vox had a surprise for you as we go to break.
[02:41:21.229 --> 02:41:22.630]  Vox, go ahead and take over here, my friend.
[02:41:24.557 --> 02:41:29.181]  Well, I was just kind of amused, you know, when I heard that Mike was going to be on.
[02:41:30.322 --> 02:41:32.603]  I figure it's time to start sporting my Cerno fashion.
[02:41:32.623 --> 02:41:35.045]  Amazing.
[02:41:36.106 --> 02:41:36.907]  Put that back up there.
[02:41:36.967 --> 02:41:38.128]  I like that Cerno's face.
[02:41:38.268 --> 02:41:38.668]  I like that.
[02:41:38.848 --> 02:41:41.090]  I'm going to wear one of those.
[02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:42.371]  By the way, I'm not one of these eagles.
[02:41:42.391 --> 02:41:44.593]  I want to celebrate other men that are fighting tyranny.
[02:41:44.913 --> 02:41:45.454]  I'm serious.
[02:41:46.034 --> 02:41:46.735]  That's a great shirt.
[02:41:46.755 --> 02:41:47.716]  How do people get one of those?
[02:41:49.117 --> 02:41:51.779]  Oh, they have them at Crypto.Fashion.
[02:41:53.092 --> 02:42:02.079]  By the way, we don't like to do this, all of us are very humble, but we have to celebrate people that are on the front line, like Trump and Sernovich and you and so many others.
[02:42:02.419 --> 02:42:03.580]  Mike, you want to comment on this new shirt?
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:04.100]  Have you seen this?
[02:42:05.401 --> 02:42:06.983]  Oh, it's definitely great.
[02:42:07.003 --> 02:42:11.866]  It has a very, sort of, ominous, it's like it could be the new Shea.
[02:42:12.006 --> 02:42:13.648]  I was even a little bit scared by that image.
[02:42:13.688 --> 02:42:14.408]  I'm like, oh wow.
[02:42:14.448 --> 02:42:15.549]  Well, it's kind of fish-eyed.
[02:42:15.589 --> 02:42:17.070]  It gives you that guerrilla look.
[02:42:17.110 --> 02:42:17.931]  Let's put that back up.
[02:42:18.567 --> 02:42:19.747]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:20.168 --> 02:42:23.229]  It's the Che Cernovich.
[02:42:23.969 --> 02:42:27.630]  But it's not a guy that thought Hispanics were subhuman and hated black people.
[02:42:27.650 --> 02:42:28.631]  It's a guy that loves everybody.
[02:42:29.911 --> 02:42:31.212]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[02:42:31.232 --> 02:42:34.793]  You know, I heard in college that Che Guevara called Mexicans subhuman roaches.
[02:42:35.313 --> 02:42:40.695]  I went and bought one of his books and the son of a bitch actually says it.
[02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:47.622]  And then I see Mexicans everywhere wearing that... I'm gonna say it's that piece of crap shirt.
[02:42:47.722 --> 02:42:49.723]  God almighty.
[02:42:50.203 --> 02:42:52.724]  We'll be right back with Mike Cernovich and Vox Day.
[02:42:52.824 --> 02:42:55.345]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:42:55.425 --> 02:42:57.986]  Our news app's now number one worldwide.
[02:43:03.558 --> 02:43:04.978]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:43:05.018 --> 02:43:06.879]  Victor, you're calling, go ahead.
[02:43:06.999 --> 02:43:08.399]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:43:08.539 --> 02:43:14.741]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:43:14.941 --> 02:43:18.922]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:43:19.162 --> 02:43:20.602]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:43:20.982 --> 02:43:27.884]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it like
[02:43:28.204 --> 02:43:30.845]  I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:43:30.905 --> 02:43:34.306]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[02:43:34.607 --> 02:43:36.187]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:43:36.247 --> 02:43:38.468]  It's people like you that didn't fund the whole operation.
[02:43:38.488 --> 02:43:43.570]  Because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:44.070]  So, thank you.
[02:43:44.090 --> 02:43:49.912]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:43:50.052 --> 02:43:51.493]  It is our highest reviewed product.
[02:43:51.753 --> 02:43:55.356]  Because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:43:55.436 --> 02:43:58.458]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[02:44:08.325 --> 02:44:13.548]  Make no mistake, we are all living in one of the most important times in human history, as populist and nationalist.
[02:44:14.693 --> 02:44:20.498]  Pro-free market forces reawaken and ignite in our darkest hour and see success everywhere.
[02:44:21.198 --> 02:44:41.354]  And we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Dinesh D'Souza, the second highest grossing documentary filmmaker in history, best-selling author, and for that, falsely imprisoned, as the president has pointed out, announcing his pardon yesterday for a nine-month false prison sentence for getting five friends to donate Hillary, again, billions of dollars, hundreds of millions
[02:44:41.674 --> 02:44:47.678]  You know, I think, Alex, that when we hear words like dangerous from CNN, we have to learn to decode or translate what they actually mean.
[02:44:47.718 --> 02:44:49.239]  So what they mean is that Mark Rich
[02:45:07.391 --> 02:45:12.318]  Uh, no matter whether he's an arms dealer or a drug trafficker, he's not dangerous to them.
[02:45:12.898 --> 02:45:24.054]  In fact, he's on their side in the sense that he is willing to lavish billions of dollars, I mean, not millions, but tens of millions of dollars into progressive and left-wing causes.
[02:45:25.094 --> 02:45:26.815]  I actually am dangerous to them.
[02:45:27.395 --> 02:45:27.656]  Why?
[02:45:27.696 --> 02:45:31.978]  Because I'm actually out there undermining their ideology at every turn.
[02:45:32.038 --> 02:45:36.100]  And so to pardon me is to unleash me in an even bigger way.
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:45.284]  So when I hear these kinds of things from CNN, far from like trying to refute them, I essentially look behind the curtain and I go, I know why you're saying that.
[02:45:45.304 --> 02:45:46.745]  And in a certain sense, you're right.
[02:45:46.905 --> 02:45:47.565]  Incredible.
[02:45:47.905 --> 02:45:51.807]  And of course, the word is that the president's told you that he wants to unleash you.
[02:45:51.827 --> 02:45:52.948]  Can you talk about that?
[02:45:54.361 --> 02:46:04.367]  Yeah, I was in my study two days ago, working away, and the phone rang, you know, unknown caller, and I picked it up, and it was the White House operator.
[02:46:04.387 --> 02:46:23.158]  She just goes, she confirmed it was me, hold the line for the President of the United States, and Trump comes on, and the first thing he said to me was, hey, Dinesh, you know, I'm sitting here with John Kelly, Chief of Staff, and we both want to let you know that we think that you're a great voice for freedom and for America.
[02:46:24.098 --> 02:46:29.760]  And he said, I gotta tell you man to man that, you know, your case, you know, you got screwed.
[02:46:30.161 --> 02:46:38.824]  He goes, you should have gotten it, it was a technicality, you should have gotten a fine and move on with life, but no, these guys went after you with everything they got.
[02:46:39.444 --> 02:46:41.306]  And he goes, it was a terrible injustice.
[02:46:41.326 --> 02:46:44.348]  He goes, the good thing is, you know, I'm in a position to correct it.
[02:46:44.608 --> 02:46:47.250]  So I want to I want to clear your slate.
[02:46:47.290 --> 02:46:49.451]  I'm going to give you a full pardon tomorrow morning.
[02:46:49.471 --> 02:46:55.275]  And I am just I want you to go out there and just do what you're doing at an even bigger scale than ever.
[02:47:03.901 --> 02:47:06.543]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:18.994 --> 02:47:20.774]  Alright, welcome back.
[02:47:20.794 --> 02:47:22.055]  These are not heady times.
[02:47:22.075 --> 02:47:23.195]  These are historic times.
[02:47:23.275 --> 02:47:26.635]  And we're getting into inside baseball, but what we do... I never troll with lies.
[02:47:28.636 --> 02:47:30.176]  I will say something that's very clear.
[02:47:30.336 --> 02:47:33.877]  I am politically Spaghetti Western Music at High Noon.
[02:47:35.457 --> 02:47:38.057]  Metaphysically, this is a showdown of powers.
[02:47:38.137 --> 02:47:39.078]  I'm not backing down.
[02:47:39.638 --> 02:47:40.818]  Mueller's not backing down.
[02:47:40.878 --> 02:47:41.798]  We're gonna have a shootout.
[02:47:42.998 --> 02:47:44.419]  Like Red River shootout in football.
[02:47:44.999 --> 02:47:46.379]  Knowing they would go with that,
[02:47:47.492 --> 02:47:50.395]  So I could illustrate, they're the ones saying, really kill Trump, attack his family.
[02:47:51.296 --> 02:47:57.241]  You know, CNN, after Scalise got caught, or got shot, they're sitting there going, got caught in gunfire.
[02:47:57.601 --> 02:47:59.843]  They tried to kill 17 members of the Freedom Caucus.
[02:48:00.844 --> 02:48:04.808]  And CNN's like, well, the guy really was, you know, mad at Trump.
[02:48:05.389 --> 02:48:06.309]  That's so sick.
[02:48:06.450 --> 02:48:07.230]  I don't want violence.
[02:48:07.250 --> 02:48:07.911]  Everybody knows that.
[02:48:07.971 --> 02:48:10.013]  But they would play that double standard.
[02:48:10.053 --> 02:48:11.694]  So that's the type of stuff I do.
[02:48:12.608 --> 02:48:13.648]  Now, Mike Cernovich is here.
[02:48:13.708 --> 02:48:14.809]  Vox Dave's going to leave us a moment.
[02:48:15.049 --> 02:48:25.612]  We'll do a little bit more with Mike Cernovich, but as we pull back here and we see the lay of the land, I'm mad at Trump about continuing the war in Afghanistan.
[02:48:26.832 --> 02:48:27.372]  He means well.
[02:48:27.412 --> 02:48:28.072]  He's a great guy.
[02:48:28.092 --> 02:48:29.053]  He's not a globalist.
[02:48:29.073 --> 02:48:29.733]  I love him to death.
[02:48:30.593 --> 02:48:34.434]  I'm mad about him continuing to not expose vaccines like he said he would do, but I'm sure we'll get to it later.
[02:48:35.875 --> 02:48:40.156]  But just sitting there, I mean, it took us a long time to get him informed about shadow banning.
[02:48:41.687 --> 02:48:45.072]  I know I got him a report in his hands a week before he talked about it.
[02:48:45.453 --> 02:48:47.476]  And then they got even worse right on time for me.
[02:48:48.698 --> 02:48:50.600]  And I'm not name-dropping, we were pushing hard.
[02:48:51.598 --> 02:48:53.659]  Like, the campaign's like, well, what do you want to tell the President?
[02:48:53.679 --> 02:48:54.700]  He wants to know what's going on.
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:56.180]  What do you want?
[02:48:56.220 --> 02:49:00.683]  I'm like, what I want is him to go after internet censorship or we're going to lose this midterm.
[02:49:01.003 --> 02:49:02.384]  This is a campaign violation.
[02:49:02.404 --> 02:49:06.826]  They're giving billions of the Democrats, letting them promote and banning all Republicans and shadow banning.
[02:49:07.166 --> 02:49:08.107]  What's shadow banning?
[02:49:08.367 --> 02:49:12.009]  I'm like, the head of the campaign, you're this big guru that knows all this stuff.
[02:49:12.029 --> 02:49:12.929]  I'm going to stop right there.
[02:49:13.409 --> 02:49:14.410]  How on earth?
[02:49:15.090 --> 02:49:18.252]  So, Mike, Vox Dei, jump at any time here.
[02:49:19.574 --> 02:49:24.238]  I love Trump, and I know he's a good guy, but he loves Fox News and the damn New York Times too much.
[02:49:24.978 --> 02:49:28.681]  I know for a fact he reads New York Times all day and sits there and watches Fox News.
[02:49:29.442 --> 02:49:33.986]  Used to they bring him clips of my show, clips of Cernovich, his son would bring those to you, you know, to him.
[02:49:34.986 --> 02:49:35.847]  This is the issue.
[02:49:35.887 --> 02:49:38.950]  They're blocking everybody, they're intimidating, they're doing it.
[02:49:39.150 --> 02:49:42.733]  I'm mad at Trump only to say this because it'll get to him.
[02:49:43.233 --> 02:49:44.334]  What does Trump need to do?
[02:49:44.434 --> 02:49:48.938]  Vox Dei, Mike Cernovich, or do you disagree that this is the big enchilada right now?
[02:49:51.977 --> 02:49:54.799]  About forcing internet censorship out in the open and what's happening.
[02:49:55.039 --> 02:49:55.659]  We've done it.
[02:49:56.079 --> 02:49:57.700]  I've pawn-sacrificed myself.
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:49:59.201]  The listeners get it.
[02:49:59.901 --> 02:50:09.387]  Well, the issue with Trump is that Trump's greatest, it's like a Greek flaw, Trump's greatest strength is also his greatest weakness.
[02:50:09.407 --> 02:50:13.529]  That he thinks he knows everything and he's totally self-confident so he's a man in his own world.
[02:50:14.392 --> 02:50:14.732]  Right.
[02:50:14.793 --> 02:50:18.036]  He really believes he could have won the election without alternative media.
[02:50:18.677 --> 02:50:19.097]  100% believes it.
[02:50:19.457 --> 02:50:22.541]  So from his mind, he thinks, well, it's bad.
[02:50:22.561 --> 02:50:23.341]  This is too bad.
[02:50:23.402 --> 02:50:24.503]  I don't like that it's happening.
[02:50:25.083 --> 02:50:29.428]  But he wants to act confident, just like he won't admit his supporters are being attacked everywhere.
[02:50:30.753 --> 02:50:31.273]  Exactly.
[02:50:31.294 --> 02:50:36.656]  So in his mind, if all alternative media is banned, it's not a big deal.
[02:50:36.736 --> 02:50:37.617]  He'll be fine.
[02:50:37.677 --> 02:50:38.377]  He'll be okay.
[02:50:38.697 --> 02:50:46.622]  Doesn't he get alternative media and all these social networks had 95% more bandwidth and people than this frickin Fox News?
[02:50:47.622 --> 02:50:48.723]  No, no, no, he doesn't.
[02:50:49.143 --> 02:50:50.884]  He believes... Well let me tell him then!
[02:50:52.045 --> 02:50:55.907]  Paul Watson had videos every day with average of 6 million views.
[02:50:56.247 --> 02:50:58.528]  At least 10 of them had 35 million views or more.
[02:50:58.568 --> 02:51:00.069]  They deleted them the day Hillary lost.
[02:51:00.329 --> 02:51:02.110]  They ignored us and didn't think we had power.
[02:51:02.750 --> 02:51:04.491]  Paul was way more reach than me.
[02:51:04.911 --> 02:51:05.612]  Okay, I'll say it.
[02:51:06.652 --> 02:51:07.012]  Anybody.
[02:51:07.473 --> 02:51:08.293]  Paul didn't even know it.
[02:51:08.533 --> 02:51:12.575]  We had billions of views for you that all disappeared on our Facebook, Trump.
[02:51:12.915 --> 02:51:16.317]  You didn't have billions of views on that stupid-ass Fox News!
[02:51:16.517 --> 02:51:17.778]  And nothing against Fox News!
[02:51:17.938 --> 02:51:18.958]  But I want to win this!
[02:51:19.478 --> 02:51:20.079]  Hell, man!
[02:51:20.879 --> 02:51:24.202]  I'm sorry, but Trump didn't know how much he had.
[02:51:24.282 --> 02:51:25.483]  Sorry, go ahead guys, I'll shut up.
[02:51:25.844 --> 02:51:32.450]  But if we're going to win, then we need to stop screwing around and playing on Facebook's platform.
[02:51:32.490 --> 02:51:36.574]  No, I agree, but what I'm saying is Trump can make them open it up for everybody.
[02:51:37.174 --> 02:51:38.355]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:51:38.615 --> 02:51:39.416]  But that's a mistake.
[02:51:39.436 --> 02:51:41.157]  We don't want them to open it up.
[02:51:41.237 --> 02:51:43.818]  We want to build our own platforms.
[02:51:43.858 --> 02:51:46.480]  But we haven't built the platforms yet, Vox.
[02:51:47.060 --> 02:51:48.982]  The reason I'm like this is we're two minutes to midnight.
[02:51:49.782 --> 02:51:50.783]  Vox, make your point for two minutes.
[02:51:50.803 --> 02:51:51.463]  I'm sorrier than Mike.
[02:51:51.763 --> 02:51:56.126]  It's just, I'm telling you, we have to attack them on censorship and election meddling now.
[02:51:56.446 --> 02:51:57.247]  That is the answer.
[02:51:57.287 --> 02:51:57.547]  Go ahead.
[02:51:58.533 --> 02:51:58.693]  Right.
[02:51:58.713 --> 02:52:02.859]  Well, but then we should be going after them on on racketeering on collusion.
[02:52:03.199 --> 02:52:04.902]  People need to be filing private suits.
[02:52:04.962 --> 02:52:08.347]  But the reality is all of this stuff is secondary.
[02:52:08.667 --> 02:52:12.232]  The main thing is to turn them into my space.
[02:52:12.492 --> 02:52:13.454]  The main thing is to
[02:52:14.375 --> 02:52:14.975]  No, I agree.
[02:52:15.015 --> 02:52:16.857]  If we leave them, that's great and they die.
[02:52:16.957 --> 02:52:17.357]  I agree.
[02:52:17.397 --> 02:52:21.221]  But now, in the next three months, I don't think it happens now.
[02:52:22.182 --> 02:52:23.723]  People are pissed they've been censored.
[02:52:24.384 --> 02:52:25.825]  I think Trump makes it a big issue.
[02:52:25.865 --> 02:52:27.207]  They back off for the election.
[02:52:27.467 --> 02:52:27.967]  We win.
[02:52:28.228 --> 02:52:29.729]  If not, they're thinking he isn't noticing.
[02:52:29.889 --> 02:52:31.851]  They're saying, will he notice we're stealing the election?
[02:52:32.131 --> 02:52:33.613]  Ahead of him losing, then we'll impeach him.
[02:52:33.633 --> 02:52:33.853]  Go ahead.
[02:52:36.010 --> 02:52:53.215]  Well, again, I think that they can, they'll make these efforts, but I think that the trend towards nationalism around the world and in the states, the fact that the economy is doing well, the fact that the tariffs are having the positive effect... No, I agree that we win long term, but we may have a civil war if we don't beat it now.
[02:52:53.235 --> 02:52:55.195]  I'm going to come back to you, Vox, you've got to go in a minute.
[02:52:55.215 --> 02:52:57.776]  Cernovich, I've been ranting, you were trying to talk, just...
[02:52:58.896 --> 02:53:01.078]  I feel at a spiritual level desperation.
[02:53:01.418 --> 02:53:04.040]  We're going to win if we take victory in our hands.
[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:07.182]  If we don't make Trump and others, which Donald Jr.
[02:53:07.222 --> 02:53:09.704]  is ready to do it, everybody gets it, everybody's ready.
[02:53:09.764 --> 02:53:16.349]  If Trump doesn't lead this train and point it out, the only reason we're still on Twitter is because Trump told Jack Dorsey, watch your ass.
[02:53:17.935 --> 02:53:23.182]  Well, I mean, I'm actually quite pessimistic about the immediate near-term solution.
[02:53:23.662 --> 02:53:24.844]  The strike's on you.
[02:53:24.924 --> 02:53:26.746]  You are the big white whale.
[02:53:27.287 --> 02:53:32.053]  And that's not racial, of course, for the illiterate liberals from Media Matters who watch these for clips.
[02:53:32.073 --> 02:53:33.755]  That's not anti-white people.
[02:53:33.795 --> 02:53:35.798]  No, he's a cat that I have without hunting for me.
[02:53:36.398 --> 02:53:36.838]  Exactly.
[02:53:36.858 --> 02:53:39.619]  But the Soros people, they're not literate, so they don't even know.
[02:53:40.219 --> 02:53:41.980]  They don't understand that reference.
[02:53:42.520 --> 02:53:43.661]  So you're the white whale.
[02:53:43.761 --> 02:53:47.562]  Now they're going to go after everybody, but they're going to go after you even more.
[02:53:47.762 --> 02:53:51.183]  And you and I, I'm not going to say why, but you and I know how they're going to do it.
[02:53:51.924 --> 02:53:53.864]  And, you know, I don't want to give them any more ideas.
[02:53:54.205 --> 02:53:58.486]  They are now banning Dinesh D'Souza's Death of a Nation from theaters.
[02:53:58.906 --> 02:54:00.767]  That was just on Dinesh's Twitter feed.
[02:54:01.447 --> 02:54:09.571]  You, sir, are costing college applicants for people, which is good because in the long term, I'm optimistic, but I'm laying out the short-term case.
[02:54:10.291 --> 02:54:18.235]  I sent a link to Daria where a college administrator was not going to let somebody come to college because they followed you on Twitter.
[02:54:18.515 --> 02:54:21.016]  Didn't like you, didn't retweet you, followed you.
[02:54:21.036 --> 02:54:22.777]  So there's totally mafia harassment.
[02:54:22.817 --> 02:54:23.397]  That's what I mean.
[02:54:23.437 --> 02:54:24.178]  Not even about us.
[02:54:24.298 --> 02:54:27.499]  It's the serious racketeering going on by Democrats.
[02:54:27.819 --> 02:54:29.060]  I think Trump makes that an issue.
[02:54:30.097 --> 02:54:41.602]  Well, yeah, but in the short term, there's going to be more bodies, literal and figurative, for right-wing people, independent thinkers, because as you know, 20% of your audience is actually liberal.
[02:54:41.622 --> 02:54:43.162]  20% of my audience is liberal.
[02:54:43.623 --> 02:54:45.103]  They're just fed up with the lies.
[02:54:45.623 --> 02:54:49.305]  They're going to go after anybody who wants to talk about vaccine awareness and
[02:54:50.026 --> 02:54:51.447]  No, I agree.
[02:54:51.467 --> 02:54:52.428]  Do five more minutes with us.
[02:54:52.448 --> 02:54:53.730]  I'm going to finish up with Vox Day.
[02:54:54.530 --> 02:54:57.974]  Again, Mike Cernovich, everybody should follow him while it's still there on Twitter.
[02:54:58.335 --> 02:55:02.419]  Vox Day at voxday.blogspot.com and Vox University.
[02:55:03.881 --> 02:55:09.487]  And again, Mike Cernovich, where's the best place for people to follow you outside of the main combines?
[02:55:10.666 --> 02:55:12.047]  Yes, Cernovich.com.
[02:55:12.107 --> 02:55:15.688]  C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H dot com.
[02:55:16.128 --> 02:55:17.409]  That's where I do the blogging.
[02:55:17.509 --> 02:55:26.072]  And as you know, I do a lot of stuff that isn't political because you can't, you can't do what you and I do if your mind is not in a good place.
[02:55:26.112 --> 02:55:26.392]  No, I agree.
[02:55:26.412 --> 02:55:28.313]  Let me tell you, I'm trying to get off this subject.
[02:55:28.393 --> 02:55:29.213]  God, I'm sick of it.
[02:55:29.253 --> 02:55:30.814]  I would have already retired if they kept messing with me.
[02:55:31.114 --> 02:55:33.715]  All right, in closing, Vox Day's got two new comic books out.
[02:55:34.375 --> 02:55:36.336]  And I sell them at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:55:36.596 --> 02:55:37.417]  You can get them wherever.
[02:55:37.437 --> 02:55:42.980]  InfoWareStore.com, Alt Hero, Rebel Cell is the second one, Crackdown is the first.
[02:55:43.220 --> 02:55:43.921]  Awesome comic.
[02:55:44.281 --> 02:55:47.363]  And it's revolutionary in a world, you know, run by Soros to do this.
[02:55:47.683 --> 02:55:49.584]  So tell folks about your latest work with Alt Hero.
[02:55:51.285 --> 02:56:00.091]  Well, we've signed with a movie producer and we are currently talking to some independent studios who are not Democratic dominated.
[02:56:01.404 --> 02:56:05.226]  And Hero Number 3 just came out two days ago.
[02:56:05.246 --> 02:56:07.647]  It's called Reprisal and it's doing very well.
[02:56:08.367 --> 02:56:13.349]  We'll have it out on print and it'll be on the InfoWars.com store very soon.
[02:56:13.369 --> 02:56:18.611]  And, you know, a lot of people look at this stuff and they say, oh, well, this is, you know, it's just comics, it's just silly.
[02:56:19.281 --> 02:56:22.762]  But this is where the seeds are planted for the revolutions of the future.
[02:56:22.782 --> 02:56:24.383]  Yeah, these are the archetypes of the future.

[02:57:38.919 --> 02:57:40.380]  The globalists hope you're a zombie.
[02:57:40.900 --> 02:57:42.802]  They hope you don't realize they're so afraid of this info.
[02:57:43.894 --> 02:57:46.876]  Back in two minutes with Mike Cernovich, then Roger Stone and more.
[02:57:47.256 --> 02:57:49.658]  Whatever you do, listening on Radio or TV, spread the links.
[02:57:50.759 --> 02:57:53.080]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:54.841]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:58:50.485 --> 02:58:50.965]  Look at that.
[02:58:50.985 --> 02:58:53.727]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[02:58:53.747 --> 02:58:55.088]  That's because it's been denatured.
[02:58:55.108 --> 02:58:55.948]  It's been watered down.
[02:58:55.968 --> 02:58:57.089]  We didn't do that.
[02:58:58.737 --> 02:59:02.840]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:04.921]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[02:59:05.502 --> 02:59:14.047]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[02:59:14.528 --> 02:59:16.209]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[02:59:16.249 --> 02:59:17.349]  Don't you get the big secret?
[02:59:18.050 --> 02:59:20.552]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[02:59:20.612 --> 02:59:21.712]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[02:59:22.493 --> 02:59:25.395]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[02:59:32.975 --> 02:59:33.315]  Look it up.
[02:59:34.436 --> 02:59:34.936]  Find out.
[02:59:36.998 --> 02:59:40.440]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[02:59:40.480 --> 02:59:45.324]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[02:59:45.784 --> 02:59:48.986]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[02:59:52.049 --> 02:59:57.953]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.792 --> 03:00:08.476]  We are on the march.
[03:00:08.616 --> 03:00:11.360]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:00:11.520 --> 03:00:21.054]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:32.229 --> 03:00:35.591]  Okay, so here's the issue and this is the issue that Trump has.
[03:01:00.382 --> 03:01:06.189]  You and I are going to be okay because they go after us harder and we do better.
[03:01:06.749 --> 03:01:10.994]  The people I worry about is I worry about the people who this is what keeps me up at night.
[03:01:11.315 --> 03:01:18.343]  I don't care about in my own mind the millions of average Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube users who are all being blacklisted.
[03:01:19.107 --> 03:01:24.411]  And they're getting doxxed, and I think college is a scam, but if you want to go to college, that's your choice.
[03:01:49.308 --> 03:01:50.210]  A good Americano.
[03:01:50.250 --> 03:01:56.344]  A guy that has muscular dystrophy and is Hispanic and shows up for free speech and gets beat up by a bunch of white dudes.
[03:01:56.725 --> 03:01:58.849]  But it's okay they beat him up because they're liberal.
[03:02:00.507 --> 03:02:07.694]  Or they find out that, oh, he liked a Facebook page or shared an article, and then they dox him, try to get him murdered, try to get him fired.
[03:02:08.034 --> 03:02:10.777]  So for me, for you and me, I'm optimistic.
[03:02:10.857 --> 03:02:19.045]  I mean, end of the day, if they somehow tried to kill my online stuff, I would just go meditate and go to the gym and lift and, you know, whatever, dude.
[03:02:19.065 --> 03:02:20.266]  Like, my life was great.
[03:02:20.386 --> 03:02:21.307]  Before I got into this,
[03:02:21.960 --> 03:02:22.561]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:02:42.416 --> 03:02:45.458]  Politically, metaphorically, Soros censors O. Cernovich.
[03:02:45.798 --> 03:02:47.699]  And it's your side, by the way, the left.
[03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:49.861]  You're the people out there.
[03:02:49.881 --> 03:02:50.721]  520 articles.
[03:02:51.062 --> 03:02:52.563]  Violence against Trump supporters.
[03:02:52.763 --> 03:02:55.264]  John Nolte of Breitbart has catalogued them.
[03:02:55.444 --> 03:02:56.245]  Vicious attacks.
[03:02:56.325 --> 03:02:58.086]  Candace Owens run out of a bar.
[03:02:58.947 --> 03:03:00.187]  Portland, Oregon.
[03:03:00.908 --> 03:03:01.969]  Women being attacked.
[03:03:02.069 --> 03:03:04.170]  A black woman had her hat stolen.
[03:03:04.730 --> 03:03:05.971]  We have people in Berkeley.
[03:03:06.051 --> 03:03:08.833]  Oh, they particularly call black police officers the N-word.
[03:03:08.893 --> 03:03:10.274]  I mean, what the hell?
[03:03:11.189 --> 03:03:12.210]  Where's the video?
[03:03:12.230 --> 03:03:14.932]  We have this video that I posted.
[03:03:15.033 --> 03:03:17.655]  I found Portland Abolish ICE.
[03:03:18.155 --> 03:03:22.339]  They call black officers, hate you, n-word hate, and they don't say the n-word.
[03:03:22.359 --> 03:03:23.580]  They say, say it all.
[03:03:23.761 --> 03:03:26.283]  But why, why would you, what, what?
[03:03:29.846 --> 03:03:30.487]  It's what they do.
[03:03:30.847 --> 03:03:35.812]  They are, so here's the thing to understand, the way to understand social justice.
[03:03:37.024 --> 03:03:40.267]  They are the intellectual descendants of Pol Pot.
[03:03:40.647 --> 03:03:42.889]  They are the intellectual descendants of Stalin.
[03:03:42.949 --> 03:03:44.430]  No, they believe they're the total rulers.
[03:03:44.770 --> 03:03:48.753]  What do you make of the police finally standing up to them in Portland and Berkeley?
[03:03:48.773 --> 03:03:51.195]  I think that sent a shockwave through their funders.
[03:03:52.216 --> 03:03:52.836]  The jigs up.
[03:03:52.896 --> 03:03:55.859]  I think they panic because they got this whole Civil War thing planned.
[03:03:56.099 --> 03:04:00.042]  I think cops even in Blue City saying no, I think that's what's got them in crisis mode.
[03:04:01.087 --> 03:04:07.709]  Well, not only that, but I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do next to Antifa, and I can announce it because there's no way to stop this.
[03:04:08.189 --> 03:04:12.910]  There is a man facing felony criminal trial in September named David Campbell.
[03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:17.831]  He tried to murder a 55-year-old Trump supporter, so his name is David Campbell.
[03:04:18.611 --> 03:04:25.593]  And once he's convicted, I will be ensuring that he is sued for his violent deeds.
[03:04:26.244 --> 03:04:30.466]  And once he is sued, as you know, there's something called discovery.
[03:04:30.867 --> 03:04:35.249]  Every email he sent, every email... You're gonna get all his documents from his providers.
[03:04:36.007 --> 03:04:43.554]  The whole enchilada, and I can say that publicly because there ain't nothing anybody can do because I'm not going to sue Antifa.
[03:04:44.254 --> 03:04:48.458]  It will only be against, it's called, it'll be against David Campbell, John Doe.
[03:04:48.798 --> 03:04:50.920]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:04:50.980 --> 03:04:54.043]  Mike Cernovich, thank you so much, talk to you again soon.
[03:04:54.403 --> 03:05:00.428]  Roger Stone, straight ahead, I'll co-host, stay with us, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, our app's number one global.
[03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:05.052]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:05:05.212 --> 03:05:10.255]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[03:05:10.435 --> 03:05:11.596]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:11.756 --> 03:05:13.357]  It is absolutely free.
[03:05:13.577 --> 03:05:18.541]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[03:05:18.801 --> 03:05:22.443]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:05:22.543 --> 03:05:26.666]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[03:05:26.866 --> 03:05:31.009]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:05:34.752 --> 03:05:35.733]  Hey, have you heard?
[03:05:36.214 --> 03:05:38.296]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[03:05:38.376 --> 03:05:39.657]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[03:05:39.837 --> 03:05:40.878]  They're all censoring us.
[03:05:41.239 --> 03:05:47.145]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[03:05:47.445 --> 03:05:50.468]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[03:06:26.087 --> 03:06:27.367]  All right, we're back live.
[03:06:27.547 --> 03:06:28.888]  I've got time for one segment.
[03:06:28.908 --> 03:06:32.069]  I want to be here the whole hour, but I've got to go take care of a bunch of stuff behind the scenes.
[03:06:32.509 --> 03:06:41.731]  There's no comments on Infowars.com or Newswars.com or PrisonPlanet.com because a disgust we've been with for like six, seven years, and they did advertising with us, we did it with them.
[03:06:42.271 --> 03:06:45.572]  They just said, hey, we're not in business with you, and we can't send you emails, MailChimp.
[03:06:46.397 --> 03:06:48.138]  They used to follow all the rules.
[03:06:48.178 --> 03:06:49.279]  They blocked us.
[03:06:49.900 --> 03:06:57.826]  It's like 15 computer groups, not just iTunes, not just Apple that runs slave factories in China, not just Google, not just YouTube.
[03:06:59.287 --> 03:06:59.907]  It's everything.
[03:07:00.267 --> 03:07:11.296]  But the good news is, even though we can't email you, millions, several million people have gone to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:07:12.546 --> 03:07:14.867]  And they've sent us their email and opted in.
[03:07:14.907 --> 03:07:18.128]  So as soon as we get the new legal lawful, this email has all these rules.
[03:07:18.508 --> 03:07:19.949]  This big tech doesn't want you using it.
[03:07:19.969 --> 03:07:23.930]  That's why they pass all these laws where they can spy on you, but you know, email is barely usable.
[03:07:24.751 --> 03:07:26.291]  This is, we're going back retro now.
[03:07:26.591 --> 03:07:30.513]  So InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:07:31.013 --> 03:07:34.915]  Our app's now number one on iTunes, number one on Droid.
[03:07:35.475 --> 03:07:37.396]  It was just number three earlier today.
[03:07:37.656 --> 03:07:38.716]  Number one on new apps.
[03:07:38.796 --> 03:07:40.457]  It's now number one and CNN,
[03:07:42.237 --> 03:07:46.159]  I mean, they're such authoritarian losers.
[03:07:46.659 --> 03:07:48.240]  They're such dirtbags.
[03:07:49.181 --> 03:07:52.362]  They're so Soviet, Nazi, whatever.
[03:07:52.422 --> 03:07:55.284]  Like, they're like, oh, take them down.
[03:07:55.324 --> 03:07:56.484]  They're number one.
[03:07:57.685 --> 03:07:58.225]  Wow.
[03:07:58.445 --> 03:07:59.606]  So you want us?
[03:07:59.806 --> 03:08:01.447]  It's like a phone book listing for the computer.
[03:08:02.387 --> 03:08:05.729]  And you pay for the app, you build it, you put it on their platform.
[03:08:06.894 --> 03:08:08.175]  And then now they're looking at it.
[03:08:08.355 --> 03:08:11.357]  I want to ask Roger Stone, banned off Twitter, what, like a year ago?
[03:08:11.898 --> 03:08:12.999]  Milo, two years ago?
[03:08:13.559 --> 03:08:21.465]  Why do you think Jack Dorsey, it's like, you know, Facebook said two weeks ago, oh, Jones has fallen the rules, and they deliberate and say, no, he hasn't, and ban us.
[03:08:21.825 --> 03:08:23.046]  Do you think Dorsey's doing that?
[03:08:23.146 --> 03:08:32.293]  Or do you think Trump's tweet a week and a half ago that shadowbanning, totally illegal, we're looking at it, of Republican congressmen and others, do you think that's got his attention?
[03:08:32.553 --> 03:08:34.734]  Because Dorsey was one of the biggest censors out there.
[03:08:35.575 --> 03:08:38.818]  Why is he suddenly playing this game with, oh, Alex Jones?
[03:08:39.219 --> 03:08:39.879]  What do you think's happening?
[03:08:39.899 --> 03:08:45.785]  In all honesty, Alex, I think it's because he banned Milo, then he banned myself.
[03:08:46.665 --> 03:08:50.269]  If he then banned you, I think he didn't like the narrative.
[03:08:50.749 --> 03:08:53.250]  We were banned for political reasons.
[03:08:54.171 --> 03:09:13.098]  Twitter's standards, their guidelines, are so incredibly vague until the newest iteration that are still broad enough for them to sift out conservative or pro-Trump or Republican or libertarian thought that it's ridiculous.
[03:09:13.138 --> 03:09:14.539]  So it's kind of a head fake.
[03:09:14.579 --> 03:09:19.001]  Plus, in all honesty, Alex, with all due respect, banned on Facebook.
[03:09:19.764 --> 03:09:21.206]  Banned on Spotify.
[03:09:21.567 --> 03:09:22.848]  Banned on YouTube.
[03:09:23.469 --> 03:09:26.033]  Banned on Instagram.
[03:09:26.593 --> 03:09:29.738]  Banned across the board on iTunes.
[03:09:31.520 --> 03:09:33.841]  The market always surprises you, doesn't it?
[03:09:34.301 --> 03:09:42.305]  A record number of people signing up for our podcasts, The Alex Jones Show, The War Room, or The Real News with David Knight.
[03:09:42.685 --> 03:09:48.528]  A record number of people watching it online, streaming on our own site.
[03:09:48.928 --> 03:09:53.430]  A record number of people listening to it on terrestrial radio.
[03:09:53.770 --> 03:09:55.671]  Your rating's up in every market.
[03:09:55.711 --> 03:09:56.151]  No, they are.
[03:09:56.171 --> 03:09:57.351]  I mean, to number one.
[03:09:59.112 --> 03:10:02.255]  So, so what are they thinking with the Streisand effect?
[03:10:02.275 --> 03:10:10.261]  Because let me tell you, millions of sign-ups for email, millions of people following our podcast at mfullwords.com forward slash show, just click it and get it.
[03:10:10.541 --> 03:10:13.223]  And everybody else doing that says, hey, here's the forbidden thing, get it.
[03:10:13.844 --> 03:10:15.145]  What did they think they were doing?
[03:10:15.205 --> 03:10:16.606]  Why do you think they did this, Roger?
[03:10:17.727 --> 03:10:23.051]  Well, because as you yourself said, we are the tip of the spear.
[03:10:23.817 --> 03:10:26.978]  Little did you know when you coined the phrase... That the U.S.
[03:10:27.058 --> 03:10:29.759]  Senator Murphy would say we're the tip of the rotting iceberg.
[03:10:30.639 --> 03:10:36.380]  Well, I mean, when you coined the phrase, we are the resistance, little did you know how true that was.
[03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:38.601]  And now they want to snuff out the resistance.
[03:10:39.081 --> 03:10:42.422]  Because we fear to go where others dare not.
[03:10:42.442 --> 03:10:43.322]  We go where eagles dare.
[03:10:43.342 --> 03:10:43.822]  It's the truth.
[03:10:43.882 --> 03:10:44.542]  Our audience does.
[03:10:44.802 --> 03:10:46.383]  Look at this quote by Senator Chris Murphy.
[03:10:47.446 --> 03:10:54.714]  Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear down the nation and tear it apart.
[03:10:55.054 --> 03:10:55.695]  That's what he's doing.
[03:10:56.696 --> 03:11:00.099]  These companies must do more than take down one website.
[03:11:00.119 --> 03:11:02.061]  The survival of our democracy depends on it.
[03:11:02.381 --> 03:11:05.304]  So destroy free speech to save our democracy.
[03:11:05.485 --> 03:11:06.666]  That is crazy.
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:14.707]  Well, first of all, we completely reject their characterization of what we talk about here and what we advocate and what we tolerate.
[03:11:15.067 --> 03:11:17.309]  That is a false depiction of who we are.
[03:11:17.369 --> 03:11:18.090]  I agree.
[03:11:18.130 --> 03:11:20.992]  By the way, I can't decide whether I love or hate that jacket.
[03:11:21.052 --> 03:11:21.313]  God.
[03:11:22.089 --> 03:11:24.790]  Well, I've got to address this.
[03:11:25.130 --> 03:11:30.351]  I was going to do it in the... Well, we'll do it later because it's really obnoxious.
[03:11:30.751 --> 03:11:33.271]  But that's fine.
[03:11:33.571 --> 03:11:35.751]  There's a story behind it which must be told.
[03:11:36.172 --> 03:11:40.052]  It was made by Chip in New York sometime in the 50s.
[03:11:40.692 --> 03:11:43.893]  And I saw it at the Fashion Institute column.
[03:11:45.013 --> 03:11:49.194]  Fashion Institute in New York had a display of Ivy League fashion.
[03:11:49.254 --> 03:11:49.734]  I saw it.
[03:11:50.214 --> 03:11:55.756]  Several years later, I saw it in a thrift shop on the Lower East Side, where I bought it for $75.
[03:11:57.697 --> 03:12:00.678]  It's a classic that you can't wear every day.
[03:12:00.698 --> 03:12:02.419]  That's certainly understandable.
[03:12:02.439 --> 03:12:04.540]  Let me bring... What do you call that, then?
[03:12:05.660 --> 03:12:07.821]  It's just an Ivy League style.
[03:12:07.941 --> 03:12:14.703]  Chip was like Brooks Brothers and their ilk, kind of a... Let's stop right there.
[03:12:14.803 --> 03:12:15.604]  Let's stop right there.
[03:12:16.424 --> 03:12:17.665]  Let's get into real serious issues.
[03:12:17.685 --> 03:12:18.605]  I shouldn't have brought this up.
[03:12:19.272 --> 03:12:21.397]  I will change for the next segment, by the way.
[03:12:21.497 --> 03:12:22.579]  No, you're great.
[03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:26.488]  It's just, let me just, you know, a nice blue sports jacket with that hat would look great, right?
[03:12:26.508 --> 03:12:27.530]  And with that black tie.
[03:12:28.091 --> 03:12:28.913]  But let me get serious here.
[03:12:29.912 --> 03:12:31.533]  We know Feinstein's a CHICOM agent.
[03:12:31.573 --> 03:12:32.413]  Most Democrats are.
[03:12:32.793 --> 03:12:35.254]  That's why they call us Russian agents, because they're the CHICOM agents.
[03:12:35.274 --> 03:12:38.656]  I never got to this New York Times thing where she was here saying I'm a Russian agent.
[03:12:38.956 --> 03:12:42.377]  Tell me how you got paid by them, how you work for them.
[03:12:42.397 --> 03:12:48.499]  It was like, tell me how you were a flying carpet salesman in Istanbul 5,000 years ago.
[03:12:48.539 --> 03:12:49.200]  Was that ridiculous?
[03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:51.441]  Feinstein, now coming out.
[03:12:51.521 --> 03:12:55.843]  Feinstein ties to China go way deeper than alleged office spy.
[03:12:56.543 --> 03:12:58.484]  So, I've said this is the issue.
[03:12:58.524 --> 03:12:59.304]  You bring this out.
[03:12:59.625 --> 03:13:01.205]  The Russian collusion is the diversion.
[03:13:01.626 --> 03:13:03.967]  Google, Apple moving to China, censoring.
[03:13:04.087 --> 03:13:05.547]  This is what Trump has to do.
[03:13:05.868 --> 03:13:06.928]  This and web censorship.
[03:13:06.988 --> 03:13:10.810]  We've forced it out in the open, made it the top story the last few days.
[03:13:10.930 --> 03:13:13.612]  It's bigger than even Republicans winning these special elections.
[03:13:13.972 --> 03:13:16.994]  There's no way Trump can ignore this now, Roger.
[03:13:17.335 --> 03:13:18.996]  I mean, my gut told me we could win.
[03:13:19.316 --> 03:13:20.136]  We could force it out.
[03:13:20.497 --> 03:13:22.078]  This is victory on a silver platter.
[03:13:22.678 --> 03:13:31.485]  How do we get Trump to talk about the Democrats and the illegal campaign contributions, blocking libertarians, conservatives, Trump nationalists, giving Democrats full power?
[03:13:31.865 --> 03:13:32.645]  It's all admitted.
[03:13:32.765 --> 03:13:33.446]  It's all happening.
[03:13:33.466 --> 03:13:37.529]  I sacrificed a lot of our operation to do this, but I knew it was critical, so I did it.
[03:13:38.169 --> 03:13:40.051]  Now I've laid out the buffet here.
[03:13:40.131 --> 03:13:40.571]  What do you think?
[03:13:41.761 --> 03:13:57.956]  Well, first of all, I think you're the first significant voice in America who has linked the tech left and those engaged in the strangulation of our First Amendment rights to the Chinese communists, particularly through Apple and other... And it's total!
[03:13:58.056 --> 03:13:58.497]  It's total!
[03:13:58.517 --> 03:13:59.057]  It's total!
[03:13:59.117 --> 03:13:59.678]  It's total!
[03:13:59.978 --> 03:14:00.458]  It's total.
[03:14:00.498 --> 03:14:01.359]  They've sold us out.
[03:14:01.639 --> 03:14:04.300]  They have completely sold us out for a mess of pottage.
[03:14:04.340 --> 03:14:13.063]  They've taken hundreds of millions of dollars to sell our security and our free expression to... And they can't believe that we're onto it.
[03:14:13.163 --> 03:14:14.584]  They can't believe we're onto it.
[03:14:16.201 --> 03:14:21.204]  You know, and the president has to grasp this as a potential campaign issue.
[03:14:21.524 --> 03:14:30.910]  The infiltration of the Democratic Party, the infiltration of the technical capability in the country by the Chinese is undeniable.
[03:14:30.990 --> 03:14:32.531]  That is the real issue here.
[03:14:32.911 --> 03:14:39.595]  That is who has their foot on our throats today because we speak out against their tyranny.
[03:14:40.015 --> 03:14:42.277]  And how pissed are they that we've blown it wide open?
[03:14:42.297 --> 03:14:43.218]  The Pentagon agrees.
[03:14:43.298 --> 03:14:44.179]  Everybody knows it's true.
[03:14:44.579 --> 03:14:45.400]  They own the debt.
[03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:46.401]  They own Hollywood.
[03:14:46.701 --> 03:14:47.842]  They own a bunch of the Democrats.
[03:14:47.922 --> 03:14:51.145]  And now, the shot across the bow with Feinstein being exposed.
[03:14:51.805 --> 03:14:55.529]  Billions that her husband made in biotech in deals with China.
[03:14:55.629 --> 03:14:57.230]  I mean, this is on.
[03:14:57.410 --> 03:14:58.031]  It is here.
[03:15:00.459 --> 03:15:01.179]  Absolutely.
[03:15:01.759 --> 03:15:04.260]  And I think the President gets it, but we shall see.
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:13.783]  A newly combative Donald Trump has been seen on Twitter of late, and he's putting together, I think, a lot of dots that need connecting these days.
[03:15:14.484 --> 03:15:18.765]  Well, the ace of spades to trump the enemy is Qaikom interference.
[03:15:19.245 --> 03:15:23.006]  It's the proof the Russians couldn't wipe their ass with both hands, nothing against them.
[03:15:23.687 --> 03:15:24.847]  And this is the key.
[03:15:24.887 --> 03:15:27.228]  We play this card, the First Amendment card, we win.
[03:15:27.748 --> 03:15:29.110]  Trump doesn't do it, we lose.
[03:15:29.170 --> 03:15:30.913]  He will play the card.
[03:15:31.454 --> 03:15:33.797]  He will execute order number 66.
[03:15:35.500 --> 03:15:38.725]  Here's the one thing you can predict about Donald Trump.
[03:15:39.463 --> 03:15:42.505]  He's entirely unpredictable, Alex.
[03:15:42.545 --> 03:15:43.226]  We shall see.
[03:15:43.606 --> 03:15:44.787]  But he has the power.
[03:15:45.247 --> 03:15:51.151]  He has the power to shape this narrative and to win in 2018 and 2020 on it, in my opinion.
[03:15:51.471 --> 03:15:56.134]  Well, I just saw Stephen Colbert last night say it's a conspiracy theory that China's involved.
[03:15:56.214 --> 03:15:57.815]  They're really scared of that.
[03:16:00.472 --> 03:16:01.393]  We knew it was coming.
[03:16:01.413 --> 03:16:02.976]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:16:03.276 --> 03:16:16.535]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:16:19.514 --> 03:16:29.457]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top 5 or top 10 news feeds.
[03:16:30.057 --> 03:16:48.962]  And so their answer is, have CNN, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and all these other corrupt organizations openly lobby for us to be removed and then organize their listeners, their viewers, the different university organizations, Antifa, sleeping giants, and a bunch of other groups
[03:16:49.997 --> 03:17:00.387]  To then go mass flag us in the community guidelines, which again was something out of 1984 or a Kafka novel, where you don't even know what you've supposedly done.
[03:17:00.407 --> 03:17:01.949]  You can't face your accuser.
[03:17:01.969 --> 03:17:07.494]  Then you get defamed by the claims of the big tech giants when they ban you.
[03:17:08.629 --> 03:17:22.315]  Make no mistake, this is being set up to create a precedent in their own words for you, nationalists, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, people that stand up to the New York Times editorial board member saying whites are subhuman and should be extincted.
[03:17:23.095 --> 03:17:27.597]  This is the agenda they're pushing that is being funded by Communist China.
[03:17:28.277 --> 03:17:30.898]  Out of everything I've broken down so far, that's the key.
[03:17:31.278 --> 03:17:35.000]  Apple has officially moved to China and is letting the government basically run Apple.
[03:17:36.109 --> 03:17:37.110]  And that, of course, is iTunes.
[03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:44.175]  Google is building a huge censorship search engine for them, and whistleblowers from inside Google say they're preparing to use it here in America.
[03:17:45.215 --> 03:17:52.640]  In fact, they're beta testing different parts of the censorship system for China on American conservatives, nationalists, and Trump supporters.
[03:17:53.221 --> 03:17:58.784]  The bigger issue is they don't like info wars exposing the fact in great detail.
[03:17:59.745 --> 03:18:12.231]  The Communist China owns our debt, owns and controls Hollywood now, is involved in massive domestic propaganda operations, and is working with the Democratic Party and with the EU and others to try to block the Trump agenda.
[03:18:12.511 --> 03:18:14.112]  They even talk about this at Davos.
[03:18:14.192 --> 03:18:16.533]  So this is 21st century warfare.
[03:18:16.953 --> 03:18:26.238]  It's happening right now, and it's designed to silence the American people and other populist movements around the world who are trying to struggle free from this corporate totalitarianism.
[03:18:26.758 --> 03:18:31.660]  This now becomes the last battle of the Civil War.
[03:18:31.840 --> 03:18:37.402]  You know, Fox, Breitbart, Sinclair, and Alex Jones, which has now been taken off Facebook, thank God.
[03:18:37.982 --> 03:18:43.825]  The number one thing you can do past standing up to this and getting informed and informing others is to simply
[03:18:44.705 --> 03:18:47.287]  Go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:18:47.707 --> 03:18:49.148]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[03:18:49.568 --> 03:18:50.408]  Just click on the link.
[03:18:50.649 --> 03:18:53.610]  Whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[03:18:54.271 --> 03:19:05.657]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform that are being censored so you can get them out to others.
[03:19:06.338 --> 03:19:10.120]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:19:10.600 --> 03:19:13.463]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[03:19:14.003 --> 03:19:18.888]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[03:19:19.128 --> 03:19:20.489]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:19:20.830 --> 03:19:21.450]  You're an adult.
[03:19:21.791 --> 03:19:23.812]  You deserve to hear what all the hubbub's about.
[03:19:24.133 --> 03:19:28.777]  You deserve to hear what the establishment is so desperate to silence so you can make your own decision.
[03:19:29.538 --> 03:19:30.639]  Infowars.com.
[03:19:30.899 --> 03:19:31.780]  Newswars.com.
[03:19:31.980 --> 03:19:33.081]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[03:19:33.441 --> 03:19:33.642]  Listen.
[03:19:34.468 --> 03:19:36.089]  I was never trying to win a popularity contest.
[03:19:36.229 --> 03:19:40.112]  I've been trying to get Americans and others to think outside the box and realize what's happening.
[03:19:40.132 --> 03:19:40.933]  We've been very successful.
[03:19:41.373 --> 03:19:42.554]  I've expected to be attacked.
[03:19:42.574 --> 03:19:46.016]  I didn't know we'd be the very tip of the spear, but it's happened.
[03:19:46.477 --> 03:19:51.320]  So now, Infowars is the banner of free speech, the renaissance in Western culture and civilization.
[03:19:51.640 --> 03:19:59.586]  And it's more important than ever that folks realize that the dominoes are beginning to fall against your cherished free speech, and you'll lose everything else if you don't stand up for it now.
[03:20:03.816 --> 03:20:08.039]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.545 --> 03:20:20.386]  They said to drill.
[03:20:21.226 --> 03:20:22.047]  It isn't a game.
[03:20:22.067 --> 03:20:23.387]  It's the real world 2018.
[03:20:23.447 --> 03:20:23.768]  Planet Earth.
[03:20:26.748 --> 03:20:36.732]  As pro-human, pro-capital defense forces wage counter-offensives against the megatech firms and the banks allied with radical Islam and the shycoms.
[03:20:39.613 --> 03:20:44.335]  Roger Stone, I'm going to let you take over here and I appreciate you hosting this hour ahead of the war and where it will also be on today.
[03:20:45.319 --> 03:21:01.294]  But what do you make, because we don't make it about ourselves right now, when they're censoring us and cutting us off every platform with our tens of millions of followers from iTunes to YouTube to Facebook, tens of millions of subscribed people that they would already not let us get to, but now they even cut that off.
[03:21:02.555 --> 03:21:03.276]  And their arrogance.
[03:21:06.667 --> 03:21:08.528]  What does Trump need to do?
[03:21:08.649 --> 03:21:16.915]  Because we're here, this is happening, this is ongoing, this is the big issue, this is the election fraud, this is the discrimination.
[03:21:17.175 --> 03:21:18.676]  Now that's one point I'm going to ask you.
[03:21:20.367 --> 03:21:22.409]  But secondarily, let me ask you this one first.
[03:21:22.429 --> 03:21:24.351]  Let me ask question B, B-side first.
[03:21:25.192 --> 03:21:31.439]  We were number three on iTunes, Android, Android today with a brand new app three weeks ago that we just launched.
[03:21:31.459 --> 03:21:32.079]  They happened to do this.
[03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:41.649]  They're now both number one on news, now trending in the top 20 and one to be the number one app in the world.
[03:21:42.509 --> 03:21:46.614]  And then CNN, these are apps that have been there for years, aren't even this close.
[03:21:47.194 --> 03:21:57.886]  CNN is ultimately involved here, everywhere, literally lobbying for just as listed in the phone book, just an app we paid for and put on to access us.
[03:21:58.607 --> 03:21:58.907]  They're
[03:22:18.826 --> 03:22:23.534]  They love Antifa 10-1 attacking Rufio and him knocking him out in defense like a lion.
[03:22:24.396 --> 03:22:25.898]  It's so villainous.
[03:22:26.900 --> 03:22:28.382]  What do they think they're doing?
[03:22:28.623 --> 03:22:30.386]  Do they not get what's happening?
[03:22:30.546 --> 03:22:32.329]  What do you make of the InfoWars app?
[03:22:33.243 --> 03:22:34.664]  The new one, the InfoWars official.
[03:22:34.924 --> 03:22:36.806]  All the other apps are skyrocketing too.
[03:22:36.926 --> 03:22:39.488]  Our apps, other apps, screwed up apps.
[03:22:39.948 --> 03:22:47.715]  But our InfoWars official is literally having 10,000 people download it every couple minutes.
[03:22:48.235 --> 03:22:49.836]  It's millions are downloading it.
[03:22:50.317 --> 03:22:51.898]  Millions are signing up for the newsletter.
[03:22:51.998 --> 03:22:54.700]  Millions are going to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:22:54.980 --> 03:22:59.864]  It's over five plus million the last few days just to get our podcast direct from us.
[03:23:00.885 --> 03:23:02.366]  They have really jumped the shark.
[03:23:02.426 --> 03:23:04.808]  Yeah, they've got our emails shut off now.
[03:23:04.888 --> 03:23:08.491]  They've got our comments shut off so you evil people can't communicate with each other.
[03:23:08.851 --> 03:23:10.732]  But that's only pissing people off more.
[03:23:11.133 --> 03:23:12.273]  Hopefully that'll be up soon.
[03:23:12.313 --> 03:23:13.414]  So yeah, we're in the fight.
[03:23:13.434 --> 03:23:15.556]  We're not saying we're unscathed, but God!
[03:23:16.036 --> 03:23:28.679]  It's great to, like, have them do this, and then I thought, you know, people would respond and be upset, and then would point out to Congress what was happening so we could fight back, so we kind of sacrificially did this, but this is going better than I thought.
[03:23:29.239 --> 03:23:30.339]  A, what do you think's happening?
[03:23:30.739 --> 03:23:33.680]  What do you think of CNN opening lobbying for their competition to be shut down?
[03:23:33.760 --> 03:23:39.781]  And B, let's not start sucking each other's, you know, what's like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction before we've actually got home.
[03:23:40.101 --> 03:23:42.402]  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, miles to go before we sleep.
[03:23:42.702 --> 03:23:44.042]  How could they jerk
[03:23:45.356 --> 03:23:47.157]  Our defeat out of the jaws of our victory.
[03:23:48.557 --> 03:23:50.478]  Well Alex, it's the free market.
[03:23:50.538 --> 03:23:51.818]  That's the marvel of it.
[03:23:51.858 --> 03:24:03.062]  Despite this near strangulation of InfoWars and the Alex Jones Show, along with The War Room and Real News with David Knight... Oh, David Knight had 10 million subscribers.
[03:24:03.142 --> 03:24:05.323]  He had 10 million subscribers.
[03:24:05.343 --> 03:24:06.083]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[03:24:06.103 --> 03:24:06.363]  You're right.
[03:24:06.383 --> 03:24:07.223]  They just blew him away.
[03:24:07.523 --> 03:24:09.184]  Never a very gentile... Sorry, go ahead.
[03:24:09.224 --> 03:24:09.404]  Go ahead.
[03:24:10.368 --> 03:24:10.689]  I don't
[03:24:27.549 --> 03:24:27.989]  No, but I agree.
[03:24:28.009 --> 03:24:29.010]  Roger, I'm going to leave now.
[03:24:47.063 --> 03:24:56.009]  And when we paid them for advertising, let's say at Facebook or Twitter, they entered into a contract with us that they have now violated.
[03:24:56.909 --> 03:24:58.850]  This has to be attacked at all levels.
[03:24:58.890 --> 03:24:59.251]  Roger.
[03:24:59.571 --> 03:25:02.873]  In the courts, on the streets, in peaceful protest.
[03:25:03.313 --> 03:25:06.635]  But that which does not kill us makes us stronger.
[03:25:06.935 --> 03:25:09.076]  And that's the effect that you refer to now.
[03:25:09.457 --> 03:25:09.977]  No, I agree.
[03:25:10.017 --> 03:25:11.538]  And with Skype, sometimes you can't hear me.
[03:25:11.598 --> 03:25:12.799]  I've been jumping in obnoxiously.
[03:25:12.819 --> 03:25:13.479]  I'm going to leave here now.
[03:25:13.499 --> 03:25:14.360]  I'm just asking this question.
[03:25:15.120 --> 03:25:16.181]  What do you make?
[03:25:17.432 --> 03:25:22.694]  Of CNN, when we go to number one, they've written like five articles.
[03:25:22.734 --> 03:25:23.734]  It was three, now it's five.
[03:25:24.395 --> 03:25:26.996]  Five articles, shows saying, ban, ban, ban.
[03:25:27.536 --> 03:25:28.957]  I mean, doesn't America get that?
[03:25:29.037 --> 03:25:30.137]  We're number one now.
[03:25:30.477 --> 03:25:31.518]  They've been on there for years.
[03:25:31.558 --> 03:25:32.218]  We beat them.
[03:25:32.778 --> 03:25:34.038]  And now they want us banned.
[03:25:34.539 --> 03:25:38.240]  You just type in, CNN, take Alex Jones off iTunes.
[03:25:38.260 --> 03:25:39.281]  That's an article from yesterday.
[03:25:39.301 --> 03:25:40.061]  It's one from today.
[03:25:40.381 --> 03:25:41.661]  There's like five articles today.
[03:25:42.082 --> 03:25:43.722]  I mean, that is so brazen.
[03:25:43.822 --> 03:25:45.323]  I think that backfires on them, Roger.
[03:25:46.394 --> 03:25:50.557]  Well, Alex, I think I told you that I was recently in New York on business.
[03:25:50.878 --> 03:25:58.203]  And when I left the apartment where I was to leave for the airport, you were on Fox.
[03:25:59.184 --> 03:26:05.649]  When I was in the cab, I heard at least three different reports about your being banned.
[03:26:05.689 --> 03:26:10.393]  When I got to the airport, of course, it was New York and CNN was on.
[03:26:10.733 --> 03:26:13.636]  They were gleefully reporting that you had been banned.
[03:26:14.697 --> 03:26:23.662]  When I got on the plane and watched the news from my seat, JetBlue is excellent in that regard, most of the news was about Alex Jones.
[03:26:24.063 --> 03:26:30.567]  They have merely catapulted your brand, and more people will find us, even if they cannot find us.
[03:26:30.587 --> 03:26:31.888]  So that's my question.
[03:26:31.948 --> 03:26:35.610]  Go to the Infowars site and sign up for our podcasts now.
[03:26:36.030 --> 03:26:38.132]  But that's my question, Roger.
[03:26:38.352 --> 03:26:39.693]  What were they thinking
[03:26:40.493 --> 03:26:42.975]  This is blown up spectacularly in their face.
[03:26:43.235 --> 03:26:47.918]  They'll probably just ban the apps, but I'm like, okay, you're number one, they ban your app?
[03:26:47.958 --> 03:26:49.079]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[03:26:51.501 --> 03:26:53.502]  It is brainless.
[03:26:53.582 --> 03:26:54.563]  It's mindless.
[03:26:55.704 --> 03:27:06.672]  But let's recognize, Apple owns the app store, and they could banish us at any time, which is why, despite our soaring, you know, people signing up,
[03:27:07.172 --> 03:27:13.035]  It's essential that you go sign up for the podcast directly at the InfoWars.com site.
[03:27:13.455 --> 03:27:17.477]  That way, the chain of command will be unbroken in the resistance.
[03:27:17.657 --> 03:27:18.857]  By the way, pull up the hill.
[03:27:18.957 --> 03:27:19.698]  I hadn't seen that.
[03:27:19.738 --> 03:27:20.278]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:27:20.958 --> 03:27:24.259]  InfoWars fans flocked to app following recent bans.
[03:27:24.580 --> 03:27:25.700]  So, EdgeNet, The Hill.
[03:27:25.860 --> 03:27:28.641]  Let's go back to The Hill, please.
[03:27:28.681 --> 03:27:31.262]  That's so un-American, because I read the article earlier.
[03:27:31.282 --> 03:27:31.723]  Scroll down.
[03:27:32.123 --> 03:27:34.224]  They want us banned because we're popular.
[03:27:34.964 --> 03:27:37.387]  This is totally blowing up in their face, Roger.
[03:27:37.807 --> 03:27:39.229]  They don't say, though, it's number one.
[03:27:39.289 --> 03:27:40.691]  It's number one.
[03:27:40.971 --> 03:27:43.134]  Number one on Android and app.
[03:27:43.494 --> 03:27:44.475]  Where do they go from this?
[03:27:44.756 --> 03:27:45.416]  Do they even lie?
[03:27:45.436 --> 03:27:47.339]  It's a day later, like, oh, it's 31st spot.
[03:27:47.439 --> 03:27:50.002]  No, it's number one, you goddamn liars.
[03:27:50.022 --> 03:27:50.863]  Excuse me, Lord.
[03:27:53.565 --> 03:27:55.386]  No, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[03:27:55.726 --> 03:27:59.647]  But the outpouring from the Infowar community has been heartening.
[03:28:00.247 --> 03:28:08.950]  The increase I can see in people buying my book, Stone's Rules, at the Infowar store, buying any of our great nutraceuticals, or our t-shirts.
[03:28:09.310 --> 03:28:11.391]  People want to be part of this revolution.
[03:28:11.411 --> 03:28:12.752]  Buying our products is a vote.
[03:28:13.752 --> 03:28:15.433]  Buying our products is a vote for freedom.
[03:28:15.773 --> 03:28:16.774]  This is Total War.
[03:28:16.874 --> 03:28:18.055]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:28:18.075 --> 03:28:19.316]  Stolecoldtruth.com.
[03:28:20.797 --> 03:28:21.517]  Fight the bullies.
[03:28:21.578 --> 03:28:22.238]  Save the internet.
[03:28:22.278 --> 03:28:22.878]  Save Infowars.
[03:28:22.918 --> 03:28:23.499]  Super special.
[03:28:23.779 --> 03:28:24.279]  Huge sales.
[03:28:24.299 --> 03:28:25.360]  All right, Roger, you take over.
[03:28:25.801 --> 03:28:28.582]  I'm gonna go deal with... I can't even tell you what just happened during the last break.
[03:28:29.523 --> 03:28:33.744]  I was told by an insider that YouTube says they got hijacked by operatives.
[03:28:34.084 --> 03:28:35.165]  That would be reached out to.
[03:28:35.185 --> 03:28:36.205]  I was told this last night.
[03:28:36.725 --> 03:28:42.767]  They just emailed during the last break, 10 minutes ago, and it was him saying, we want you to appeal this.
[03:28:42.907 --> 03:28:44.647]  We want to reinstate you right now.
[03:28:45.067 --> 03:28:46.768]  So that's breaking news right now.
[03:28:46.828 --> 03:28:47.588]  Good stuff's happening.
[03:28:47.908 --> 03:28:49.048]  Keep the pressure on, folks.
[03:28:49.108 --> 03:28:50.049]  America's still alive.
[03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:51.489]  Roger Stone straight ahead.
[03:28:51.529 --> 03:28:52.509]  It's unscripted, real.
[03:28:52.769 --> 03:28:54.250]  It's obnoxious, but it's real.
[03:28:54.650 --> 03:28:56.250]  I'm obnoxious, but I love you.
[03:28:56.571 --> 03:28:57.671]  We'll be back with Roger Stone.
[03:28:57.691 --> 03:28:58.031]  Stay with us.
[03:29:03.874 --> 03:29:11.376]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[03:29:11.876 --> 03:29:24.960]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[03:29:26.420 --> 03:29:29.743]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum, through cold space.
[03:29:30.223 --> 03:29:34.347]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[03:29:34.567 --> 03:29:36.689]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[03:29:39.346 --> 03:29:55.477]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[03:29:55.677 --> 03:29:56.397]  InfoWars.
[03:29:56.778 --> 03:29:57.658]  Tomorrow's news.
[03:29:57.958 --> 03:29:58.279]  Today.
[03:29:59.219 --> 03:30:03.661]  Alpha Power, vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[03:30:03.801 --> 03:30:11.684]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[03:30:12.144 --> 03:30:13.765]  But, here's what you want to know.
[03:30:14.753 --> 03:30:20.716]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[03:30:21.376 --> 03:30:24.917]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[03:30:25.798 --> 03:30:33.781]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[03:30:34.381 --> 03:30:42.045]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[03:30:42.845 --> 03:30:46.613]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[03:30:47.174 --> 03:30:47.996]  It's Alpha Power.
[03:30:48.036 --> 03:30:51.143]  And quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[03:30:52.228 --> 03:31:07.082]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[03:31:07.502 --> 03:31:12.887]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[03:31:13.167 --> 03:31:14.709]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[03:31:15.009 --> 03:31:15.849]  Oh man, it's really great.
[03:31:15.869 --> 03:31:16.349]  It really works.
[03:31:16.369 --> 03:31:18.550]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with all the power.
[03:31:18.750 --> 03:31:20.950]  Because I said, I want to dominate the industry.
[03:31:21.490 --> 03:31:25.811]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[03:31:25.831 --> 03:31:27.151]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[03:31:27.991 --> 03:31:35.212]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[03:31:35.232 --> 03:31:36.653]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[03:31:37.233 --> 03:31:38.813]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[03:31:38.833 --> 03:31:39.953]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[03:31:40.013 --> 03:31:41.674]  You've got marketing other costs that go in.
[03:31:44.574 --> 03:31:45.435]  But here's an example.
[03:31:46.255 --> 03:31:53.841]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[03:31:53.861 --> 03:31:55.562]  It just has a little bit in it.
[03:31:56.042 --> 03:32:02.207]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[03:32:02.907 --> 03:32:07.990]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[03:32:08.270 --> 03:32:16.615]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting fifteen, twenty dollars, thirty dollars, forty dollars, depending on the product, in them.
[03:32:17.015 --> 03:32:18.036]  Nobody else does that.
[03:32:18.116 --> 03:32:20.837]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[03:32:21.317 --> 03:32:31.083]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in
[03:32:31.383 --> 03:32:37.487]  Quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[03:32:37.867 --> 03:32:46.813]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the globalists, a 360 win.
[03:32:46.833 --> 03:32:49.195]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[03:32:49.575 --> 03:32:54.858]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:32:54.878 --> 03:32:55.279]  A total 360 win.
[03:33:03.251 --> 03:33:09.493]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.894 --> 03:33:19.795]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:33:20.255 --> 03:33:24.176]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:24.776 --> 03:33:28.017]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:28.037 --> 03:33:29.697]  Welcome back.
[03:33:34.289 --> 03:33:41.570]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, and yes, I have done a more subdued sports jacket.
[03:33:42.411 --> 03:33:59.154]  My chapeau today, my hat, is a homage to Matt Drudge, who I admire for his standing tall in his coverage of the assault on Alex Jones in Infowars when it comes to their First Amendment rights.
[03:33:59.961 --> 03:34:22.243]  In what has been one of the most chilling things I have ever seen, a tech left blitzkrieg of censorship has been visited on Alex Jones and the InfoWars site, getting knocked simultaneously off of Facebook, Periscope, Spotify,
[03:34:23.015 --> 03:34:25.977]  YouTube's and others.
[03:34:26.518 --> 03:34:32.042]  It is stunning, the obviousness of this takedown.
[03:34:32.863 --> 03:34:47.775]  It's very important to note that is based solely on a mischaracterization, a distortion of the various things that Alex Jones and the folks at InfoWars have actually said.
[03:34:48.968 --> 03:35:00.813]  You don't have to agree with Alex Jones or anyone here at InfoWars to agree that we have an absolute First Amendment right to say it.
[03:35:01.833 --> 03:35:07.456]  Unfortunately, that argument will probably not prevail in the courts.
[03:35:08.563 --> 03:35:25.594]  Because on the one hand, while Facebook and Twitter and others on that platform, such as Instagram, claim to be the town square, the public square, they in fact are privately owned companies.
[03:35:26.315 --> 03:35:30.498]  Perhaps it is time for them to be regulated like utilities.
[03:35:30.878 --> 03:35:33.179]  This would have to be done by the Congress.
[03:35:33.700 --> 03:35:37.002]  But there are other issues on which they are vulnerable.
[03:35:37.737 --> 03:35:46.543]  When I was banned at Twitter, shortly after my friend Milo was banned, I vowed to bring a legal action.
[03:35:47.363 --> 03:35:48.204]  And I will.
[03:35:48.911 --> 03:36:08.131]  But I let others who had been banned rush into that breach to see which of their legal arguments withstand early judicial examination and could get beyond summary judgment.
[03:36:09.127 --> 03:36:23.489]  The most favorable issues here pertain to these behemoths in the tech left signing of contracts with people who sign up.
[03:36:24.219 --> 03:36:48.551]  They are also using antitrust and monopolistic practices to crowd out the competition, while at the same time engaging actively in shadow banning and a dozen other techniques in which they manipulate the algorithms, the reach, and the presence of conservative voices.
[03:36:49.291 --> 03:36:51.033]  We're going to take your calls.
[03:36:51.153 --> 03:36:53.134]  I want to stay focused on this issue.
[03:36:53.695 --> 03:36:58.118]  But I also want to reflect on something Alex Jones has said from the beginning.
[03:36:58.138 --> 03:37:02.482]  Because I must tell you, I talk to him often late at night.
[03:37:03.496 --> 03:37:07.781]  And he's stoic in the face of this onslaught.
[03:37:07.881 --> 03:37:18.353]  He's resolved to make InfoWars bigger and more successful and to reach beyond those who listen to us now.
[03:37:18.894 --> 03:37:20.416]  He is gratified.
[03:37:21.116 --> 03:37:38.865]  So many people in the community have rallied to our podcasts, rallied to our app application, rallied to the InfoWars.com store, where we are having record traffic on every front.
[03:37:40.138 --> 03:37:45.604]  On terrestrial radio, the ratings are up for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:37:46.244 --> 03:37:54.053]  Where it appears on television, where many states have recently signed up, our ratings are up.
[03:37:54.493 --> 03:37:57.997]  The American people know the real deal when they see it.
[03:37:58.457 --> 03:38:06.061]  You don't have to agree with everything Alex Jones says to realize that he's a patriot and his heart is in the right place.
[03:38:06.601 --> 03:38:19.168]  And I'm tired of seeing the fake news left and those on the tech left distort the things he has actually said on news events over the many decades that he has covered them.
[03:38:19.748 --> 03:38:26.751]  So, if there were ever a time that InfoWars needs your assistance, that time would be now.
[03:38:27.211 --> 03:38:36.074]  I urge you to go to the InfoWars store right now, because we have some terrific specials that I think are worthy of pointing out.
[03:38:36.827 --> 03:38:54.337]  Among others, you can get my new book, Stone's Rules, at a terrific price on the InfoWars.com store with a special offer that is available to InfoWarriors only.
[03:38:55.080 --> 03:39:00.741]  If you buy my new book, Stone's Rules, which is a field manual for victory.
[03:39:00.961 --> 03:39:18.405]  It's the Alinsky manual for people who think like we do, although it's applicable to anybody as a surefire list of axioms and guidelines that have girded me for a 40-year career in the arena.
[03:39:18.885 --> 03:39:22.186]  But if you buy it on the InfoWars.com store,
[03:39:22.726 --> 03:39:28.791]  And you mail it to me at an address that we will give you here in South Florida.
[03:39:29.371 --> 03:39:35.656]  I will gladly personalize the book for you and mail it back to you.
[03:39:36.196 --> 03:39:49.626]  I stress that this is an offer only available to Info Warriors, and I was gratified when I returned from a recent business trip to have well over a hundred books to sign and get out the door.
[03:39:50.446 --> 03:39:53.709]  We're going to get you that address before the end of the show.
[03:39:54.590 --> 03:39:58.093]  But we we really hope you will patronize the store.
[03:39:59.014 --> 03:40:02.977]  You'll take a look at our nutraceuticals, our T-shirts and so on.
[03:40:03.898 --> 03:40:16.649]  The effort to censor Alex Jones tied with the outrageous, massively expensive harassment lawsuits launched by the Soros Connected Left.
[03:40:17.790 --> 03:40:34.708]  And the vilification in the mainstream media in which words are put in his mouth and things and thoughts and theories and memes are attributed to him that he never said is a Kafkaesque nightmare.
[03:40:35.568 --> 03:40:45.832]  And now this recent assault makes it all the more important that you take your favorite links from InfoWars and that you post them to your own social media.
[03:40:46.192 --> 03:40:58.417]  And you take the very best of the War Room and you send it to everybody on your email friend list, on your Instagram friend list, on your Facebook friend list.
[03:40:58.797 --> 03:41:02.158]  You can be an army of one for freedom.
[03:41:02.698 --> 03:41:22.872]  If you support the president, if you support his agenda, if you oppose the globalists, if Alex Jones makes you laugh and entertains you at the same time he educates you about a different, non-neocon view of the world, well then we need his voice.
[03:41:23.432 --> 03:41:30.337]  He has to be part of a vibrant, robust, alternative media that's based in a free internet.
[03:41:30.937 --> 03:41:32.638]  The bad guys are clear.
[03:41:33.098 --> 03:41:45.525]  Google, Apple, who has sold their soul to the Chinese, many others of these giant Silicon Valley monsters now seek
[03:41:46.135 --> 03:41:48.496]  To rig the very next election.
[03:41:48.516 --> 03:42:08.266]  We're going to take calls in the next segment, but the unequal handling on Facebook and Twitter and so on of Republican and Democratic candidates in view of advertising raises a whole new battlefield on which the left can be defeated under the laws of the United States.
[03:42:08.726 --> 03:42:12.968]  It is a stunning strategic error on their part.
[03:42:13.468 --> 03:42:17.811]  To treat candidates who are Republicans and Democrats differently.
[03:42:18.251 --> 03:42:21.473]  This is a giant mistake by the opposition.
[03:42:21.954 --> 03:42:27.678]  If you read Stone's Rules, you know we wait for and pounce upon those mistakes.
[03:42:28.118 --> 03:42:30.860]  Thanks for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:34.162]  Grab your copy of Stone's Rules.
[03:42:34.822 --> 03:42:41.165]  And we'll send you, we'll put up the address here in a bit where you can send it for your personalized copy.
[03:42:41.585 --> 03:42:43.406]  It would be my pleasure.
[03:42:43.826 --> 03:42:44.786]  Much to talk about.
[03:42:44.986 --> 03:42:48.548]  We're taking your calls in the next segment.
[03:42:48.568 --> 03:42:52.089]  Let's put up the phone number if we are able to do that.
[03:42:53.090 --> 03:42:57.371]  And we will get you on the InfoWars hotline.
[03:42:57.411 --> 03:42:58.452]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:02.046 --> 03:43:20.357]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:20.437 --> 03:43:25.861]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:26.721 --> 03:43:27.402]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:27.862 --> 03:43:30.684]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:31.324 --> 03:43:32.305]  And so much more.
[03:43:32.846 --> 03:43:34.007]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:34.227 --> 03:43:35.928]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:35.948 --> 03:43:41.653]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:41.753 --> 03:43:42.974]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:43.094 --> 03:43:44.916]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:44.976 --> 03:43:47.378]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:47.578 --> 03:43:48.839]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:49.019 --> 03:43:50.821]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:51.381 --> 03:43:51.982]  Immune Wall.
[03:43:52.102 --> 03:43:53.423]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:53.523 --> 03:43:54.704]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:00.077 --> 03:44:03.278]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:44:03.718 --> 03:44:05.039]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:44:05.519 --> 03:44:17.044]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:44:17.744 --> 03:44:22.846]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[03:44:23.166 --> 03:44:26.649]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:44:27.070 --> 03:44:32.915]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:44:33.115 --> 03:44:37.760]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:44:38.280 --> 03:44:40.601]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:44:40.941 --> 03:44:42.281]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:44:42.681 --> 03:44:52.283]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:44:52.383 --> 03:44:54.564]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:44:55.084 --> 03:44:59.945]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:45:01.312 --> 03:45:05.633]  All these other company heads and all these other people know this, and they won't say it.
[03:45:05.733 --> 03:45:06.473]  So I'm here.
[03:45:06.813 --> 03:45:07.273]  Hammering.
[03:45:07.473 --> 03:45:07.953]  Hammering.
[03:45:08.134 --> 03:45:08.594]  Hammering.
[03:45:08.794 --> 03:45:09.234]  Hammering.
[03:45:09.574 --> 03:45:10.494]  Stop the hammering.
[03:45:10.954 --> 03:45:12.434]  Stop the hammering out there.
[03:45:12.454 --> 03:45:13.315]  Who's got a hammer?
[03:45:13.575 --> 03:45:14.095]  Where is it?
[03:45:14.415 --> 03:45:14.895]  Hammering.
[03:45:15.095 --> 03:45:15.535]  Hammering.
[03:45:15.735 --> 03:45:16.195]  Hammering.
[03:45:16.415 --> 03:45:16.855]  Hammering.
[03:45:17.195 --> 03:45:18.096]  Where's the hammer?
[03:45:18.916 --> 03:45:20.756]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor.
[03:45:20.856 --> 03:45:22.997]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering.
[03:45:23.177 --> 03:45:23.637]  Hammering.
[03:45:23.837 --> 03:45:24.297]  Hammering.
[03:45:24.497 --> 03:45:24.937]  Hammering.
[03:45:25.157 --> 03:45:25.618]  Hammering.
[03:45:25.818 --> 03:45:26.258]  Hammering.
[03:45:26.598 --> 03:45:28.199]  Stop the hammering!
[03:45:28.740 --> 03:45:29.220]  Hammering.
[03:45:29.400 --> 03:45:29.840]  Hammering.
[03:45:30.060 --> 03:45:30.521]  Hammering.
[03:45:30.721 --> 03:45:31.161]  Hammering.
[03:45:31.341 --> 03:45:32.662]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[03:45:32.682 --> 03:45:34.303]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[03:45:34.443 --> 03:45:35.924]  Stop the hammering!
[03:45:36.224 --> 03:45:36.644]  Hammering.
[03:45:36.865 --> 03:45:37.245]  Hammering.
[03:45:38.025 --> 03:45:38.886]  And all these fools.
[03:45:40.066 --> 03:45:42.269]  And all these traders don't get it.
[03:45:42.850 --> 03:45:49.259]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[03:45:49.840 --> 03:45:51.883]  It just f***ing sucks.
[03:45:52.223 --> 03:45:56.469]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[03:45:57.150 --> 03:46:03.071]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control of everything.
[03:46:03.111 --> 03:46:03.491]  They're here.
[03:46:03.971 --> 03:46:06.872]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[03:46:06.932 --> 03:46:07.672]  That's what I know.
[03:46:08.332 --> 03:46:11.413]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.
[03:46:11.813 --> 03:46:17.394]  Our supplements, our products, our t-shirts, all of it is Choose Your Own Adventure at Infowarshore.com.
[03:46:17.694 --> 03:46:18.634]  Standing with America.
[03:46:18.874 --> 03:46:20.614]  Standing against the Chai-coms in Hollywood.
[03:46:20.854 --> 03:46:22.275]  Standing for victory and winning.
[03:46:22.455 --> 03:46:23.015]  Thanks to you.
[03:46:23.095 --> 03:46:23.575]  We'll be back.
[03:46:24.435 --> 03:46:27.517]  I'll go down to the g-d-d-d floor myself and stop it.
[03:46:27.557 --> 03:46:29.338]  Keep the g-d-d-d commercial break going.
[03:46:29.839 --> 03:46:33.561]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:46:33.701 --> 03:46:38.764]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[03:46:38.925 --> 03:46:40.085]  And here's the best part.
[03:46:40.245 --> 03:46:41.867]  It is absolutely free.
[03:46:42.067 --> 03:46:46.930]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWar today.
[03:46:47.270 --> 03:46:51.032]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:46:51.072 --> 03:46:55.134]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[03:46:55.354 --> 03:46:59.717]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:47:04.259 --> 03:47:06.861]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.260 --> 03:47:29.684]  This is Bernie Sanders, and I know a lot of my supporters may not believe this, but I listen to Roger Stone whenever he's on InfoWallace.
[03:47:30.004 --> 03:47:34.646]  It's a great program, at least in my opinion.
[03:47:35.867 --> 03:47:38.888]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:39.068 --> 03:47:42.650]  As I promised, we're gonna take your calls in just a moment.
[03:47:43.462 --> 03:48:04.013]  One of the things that I have found heartening was the fact that folks like Matt Drudge and Tucker Carlson, the folks at Breitbart, now Laura Ingram this morning, are all standing up and objecting to the strangulation of the First Amendment rights of Alex Jones.
[03:48:04.733 --> 03:48:11.197]  They understand you don't have to agree with everything Alex Jones says to recognize that he has a right to say it.
[03:48:11.988 --> 03:48:20.964]  And therefore I salute them and others such as Mike Savage who have been, who have had the cojones to speak up.
[03:48:21.573 --> 03:48:31.977]  But recognize that this wave of censorship, if it is successful in silencing Alex Jones and InfoWars, is headed to a broader series of targets.
[03:48:32.437 --> 03:48:37.960]  They're already manipulating algorithms and shadow banning conservatives across the board.
[03:48:38.340 --> 03:48:46.483]  And it would be foolish not to think that effective patriots like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson
[03:48:46.903 --> 03:48:47.363]  Hi, Roger.
[03:48:47.663 --> 03:48:49.424]  Great to talk to you.
[03:49:08.812 --> 03:49:14.638]  I'd just like to point out that big wars, they don't start in Washington or even at Berkeley.
[03:49:14.658 --> 03:49:22.847]  They start in unimportant corners of the world, like the Balkans, the Ikistans, and in this case, the Banana Republics.
[03:49:23.488 --> 03:49:26.652]  And I believe that Trump is pressing the issues.
[03:49:27.132 --> 03:49:30.356]  There are so many corrupt politicians that are going to jail.
[03:49:31.076 --> 03:49:51.993]  In countries South America and Central America right now, I believe that Trump has heard the cry of not only the people of the United States of America, but of the Americans as a whole, and that political corruption is really starting to be cracked down on, and setting a precedent for the jailing of people like Podesta and Hillary Clinton.
[03:49:54.844 --> 03:50:19.245]  Well, I like the sentiments of your call, but I am not one who subscribes to some online theories that there are someplace hundreds of sealed indictments against some of the most leading criminals in the Obama and Clinton orbit, or that Jeff Session has some secret plan that will suddenly be unveiled on a future given date proving that he isn't the
[03:50:19.825 --> 03:50:20.306]  We're good.
[03:50:38.940 --> 03:50:50.388]  Application of justice where Democrats and insiders are not held to the same legal standards as Republicans and outsiders.
[03:50:51.168 --> 03:51:02.877]  And where the instruments of government, including surveillance in violation of our Constitution, are used in a witch hunt
[03:51:03.377 --> 03:51:21.126]  To try to not only deny Donald Trump the presidency, but to create an insurance policy and a narrative to be used to take him down if in the improbable course of events he won the presidency.
[03:51:21.526 --> 03:51:22.547]  It's a great call.
[03:51:22.767 --> 03:51:25.769]  I thank you for calling, Pastor Sam.
[03:51:26.149 --> 03:51:27.650]  What's going on in Mexico?
[03:51:27.690 --> 03:51:28.330]  What do you see?
[03:51:33.804 --> 03:51:37.165]  I wondered on the conditions in Mexico.
[03:51:37.225 --> 03:51:42.127]  The last time we spoke, there was a great deal of violence and unrest.
[03:51:44.648 --> 03:51:47.209]  Okay, I'm sorry we've lost our caller.
[03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:51.190]  Let's go to Jim in Florida, my home state.
[03:51:51.531 --> 03:51:53.311]  Jim, another call here if we can.
[03:51:55.212 --> 03:51:58.113]  It's an honor and a privilege to talk to you, Mr. Stone.
[03:51:58.933 --> 03:51:59.534]  Thank you, Jim.
[03:51:59.574 --> 03:52:00.454]  What's on your mind?
[03:52:01.375 --> 03:52:03.796]  Um, there was only two points I had.
[03:52:03.856 --> 03:52:09.097]  I'm a 100% disabled veteran, a former military officer.
[03:52:10.237 --> 03:52:18.238]  I had my all-expense-paid vacation to beautiful sunny Southeast Asia, and that wasn't such a good time.
[03:52:18.939 --> 03:52:30.821]  But I have gotten 25 people who are veterans to call up our local Brevard County, you know,
[03:52:31.423 --> 03:52:35.484]  Representative, and to talk to our Congress people.
[03:52:36.984 --> 03:52:45.905]  And it's a small contribution, but the thing is, is that this Internet censorship, this violates our First Amendment rights.
[03:52:47.766 --> 03:52:51.186]  We can't put up with, and we've got to stand up to this.
[03:52:52.146 --> 03:53:01.108]  And if other veterans, I don't care if they're disabled or quite well and healthy or where they came from, but if they could each
[03:53:01.934 --> 03:53:05.556]  Well, first of all, obviously we thank you for your service.
[03:53:32.370 --> 03:53:37.285]  Secondarily, a shout out to my many, many friends in Brevard County.
[03:53:38.398 --> 03:53:40.840]  But the caller is absolutely right.
[03:53:40.880 --> 03:53:42.180]  Jim is absolutely right.
[03:53:42.340 --> 03:54:06.433]  The key is to light up your congressman about the dangers of Internet censorship and the fact that even Republican candidates for re-election will be disadvantaged as these tech left companies manipulate their political advertising rules and their standards to deny Republicans equal access to this important medium.
[03:54:07.083 --> 03:54:14.129]  So reach out now and contact your congressman, whether you're a veteran or whether you are not.
[03:54:15.170 --> 03:54:16.230]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:54:16.311 --> 03:54:20.994]  It has been my privilege to be here today on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:21.835 --> 03:54:28.821]  When they dropped this bomb of censorship on Alex Jones, he told me something big is up.
[03:54:28.921 --> 03:54:31.743]  This is the precursor of something big.
[03:54:32.572 --> 03:54:52.866]  It is no surprise to the listeners of InfoWars or the Alex Jones Show that I have a runaway special prosecutor in Robert Mueller investigating every aspect, every molecule of my life, my personal life, my family life, my political life, my business life.
[03:54:53.406 --> 03:54:59.633]  I have reason to believe that I was under a FISA warrant and illegally surveilled.
[03:55:00.053 --> 03:55:03.957]  I think I have been under more recent surveillance.
[03:55:04.397 --> 03:55:09.002]  And I can tell you definitively, there is no Russian collusion.
[03:55:09.102 --> 03:55:11.925]  There is no WikiLeaks collaboration.
[03:55:12.445 --> 03:55:16.267]  There is no nonsense regarding John Podesta's emails.
[03:55:16.707 --> 03:55:21.109]  There is no hacking of emails or any other material.
[03:55:21.789 --> 03:55:25.611]  That is a conspiracy theory spun by the left.
[03:55:26.297 --> 03:55:49.936]  But like Alex Jones, I face multi-million dollar lawsuits, sore loser suits from an Obama-affiliated and directed group on the left, the Democratic National Committee, a surging Senate Intelligence Committee investigation, the Senate Judiciary Committee investigation, and of course now we know, as CNN has reported,
[03:55:51.057 --> 03:55:53.298]  Mr. Mueller is investigating my finances.
[03:55:53.739 --> 03:55:57.862]  Numerous of my associates have been taken before a grand jury.
[03:55:58.242 --> 03:56:03.886]  But I'm guilty of no crime in connection with the 2016 election or anything else.
[03:56:04.427 --> 03:56:05.668]  The witch hunt continues.
[03:56:06.548 --> 03:56:07.769]  I am not a wealthy man.
[03:56:07.989 --> 03:56:17.977]  Online stories that say Roger Stone is worth $20 million are bogus, posted most likely by David Brock or some other left-wing crank.
[03:56:19.132 --> 03:56:21.893]  This threatens to destroy me and my family.
[03:56:23.133 --> 03:56:26.574]  These bills are draining as I prepare a defense.
[03:56:26.914 --> 03:56:33.215]  Please go to StoneDefenseFund.com to help us in this vital fight.
[03:56:33.615 --> 03:56:36.136]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:56:36.996 --> 03:56:38.756]  That's actually, well, there it is.
[03:56:38.816 --> 03:56:43.958]  We have a better version of that, but StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:56:44.678 --> 03:56:45.838]  And God will bless you.
[03:56:46.358 --> 03:56:55.710]  And stop by the InfoWars.com store to make a special contribution to them in their time of need.
[03:56:55.991 --> 03:57:01.117]  These are linked issues, folks, because they would like to deny me
[03:57:01.838 --> 03:57:15.172]  The Infowars platform when they launched some illicit attempt to frame me or railroad me in an attempt to squeeze me to testify against my friend of 40 years, Donald Trump.
[03:57:15.573 --> 03:57:18.055]  That is something I will not do.
[03:57:18.476 --> 03:57:20.338]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:57:20.538 --> 03:57:21.139]  Many thanks.
[03:57:22.019 --> 03:57:27.823]  And remember, this fight, the fight over internet censorship, is about you.
[03:57:28.204 --> 03:57:31.426]  Whether you like him or not, we are all Alex Jones now.
[03:57:31.786 --> 03:57:43.134]  This is about all of our right to a free, vibrant, and open internet, and the kind of discourse that allowed for the greatest upset in American history.
[03:57:43.474 --> 03:57:48.077]  We must fight for our right to free speech and communications.
[03:57:48.417 --> 03:57:49.058]  God bless you.
[03:57:50.658 --> 03:57:55.700]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[03:57:55.840 --> 03:58:00.661]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver.
[03:58:00.781 --> 03:58:04.122]  That is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[03:58:04.182 --> 03:58:12.925]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked for first-aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and secondary burns, skin irritations.
[03:58:13.145 --> 03:58:15.365]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[03:58:15.485 --> 03:58:17.446]  Some medical-grade stores have it.
[03:58:17.666 --> 03:58:19.447]  It's just incredible.
[03:58:19.527 --> 03:58:20.428]  It's $29.95 out of the gate.
[03:58:20.508 --> 03:58:21.709]  This is next level.
[03:58:21.749 --> 03:58:23.310]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:27.973]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[03:58:28.333 --> 03:58:32.736]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[03:58:32.877 --> 03:58:36.319]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[03:58:36.479 --> 03:58:37.740]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[03:58:37.900 --> 03:58:40.742]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:58:41.082 --> 03:58:49.726]  And we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals, and he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[03:58:49.806 --> 03:58:54.128]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff,
