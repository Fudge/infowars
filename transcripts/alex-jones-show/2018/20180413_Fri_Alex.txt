[00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:15.387]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:00:16.087 --> 00:00:30.516]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.877 --> 00:00:32.338]  Here we are ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:48.264]  Friday, hard to believe the 13th day of April 2018, and we're gonna be riding, riding, riding, riding, right through the next four hours, then another three hours with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone in the war room.
[00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:51.547]  That'll be it for this emergency 34-hour transmission.
[00:00:52.288 --> 00:00:54.529]  Stop World War with Russia!
[00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.074]  And there have been some major signs that Trump is backing away from the
[00:01:01.403 --> 00:01:09.727]  Tweets about Assad being a murderer with gas and being an animal and that our smart missiles were coming.
[00:01:10.707 --> 00:01:12.108]  Really didn't like that on Wednesday.
[00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:13.929]  Pat Buchanan didn't like it either.
[00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:17.670]  First thing Trump's really done that made Pat Buchanan want to throw up.
[00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.272]  Well, yesterday Trump tweeted, I never said I'm going to strike Syria.
[00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:24.693]  Never said if I would, never said if I wouldn't.
[00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:27.234]  Okay, I like everything else Trump's doing.
[00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:28.575]  I know he's under attack.
[00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:30.296]  I know I'm under massive attack for supporting him.
[00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:39.843]  I understand the globalists are really upset because he's mainly taking power away from them and transferring it back to the nation-state, out of the TPP, out of the UN.
[00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:44.605]  But that said, there's other big signs that things are still cooking.
[00:01:45.766 --> 00:02:00.714]  And if the neocons and globalists have already been caught staging three chemical attacks, and now this fourth one appears to be staged, and they sure try to get us to rush into war hours after it happened, and have been beating that drum that we're all Russian agents and we don't want World War III,
[00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:03.626]  How dare Russia go defeat ISIS?
[00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:09.931]  But still, in the air, a nuclear doomsday plane goes airborne as war fears grow.
[00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.573]  E-4B Night Watch allows U.S.
[00:02:12.613 --> 00:02:18.157]  to maintain chain of command in the event of a major conflict, and the airplanes are airborne right now.
[00:02:18.217 --> 00:02:19.057]  There's nine of them.
[00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:25.562]  And they are normally following the President around, but on the ground, except when they're following the President.
[00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.414]  But once the DEFCON goes up closer to thermal nuclear war, they stay in the air, at least part of them.
[00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:37.597]  They can stay in the air for 150 hours, that's what's admitted.
[00:02:38.037 --> 00:02:43.141]  They're electromagnetically shielded, so that they can take a nuke going off just a few miles away.
[00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:50.988]  That is a high-tech piece of equipment and undoubtedly one of the most expensive aircraft in the world.
[00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:58.411]  And I saw some foolish comments on Infowars going, how are you going to run command and control with only 50 people on board?
[00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:01.934]  It's the people in command back to folks on the ground.
[00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:04.116]  It doesn't mean the whole command and control is in the air.
[00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:14.427]  Just like a couple of AWACS can direct the whole attack of hundreds of jet aircraft, sorties, fighter bombers, you name it.
[00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:16.369]  But the fact that it's in the air,
[00:03:18.695 --> 00:03:23.137]  That most of the nine planes are in the air, that's classified, but reportedly most of them are in the air, they're being seen.
[00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:24.898]  Confirmed that some are in the air.
[00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.600]  Shows you that this is a serious situation.
[00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:32.842]  Correction, I said nine planes, there's ten planes.
[00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:36.183]  So we're going to be breaking all of this down.
[00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:39.705]  Obviously Trump has come out and called Comey a slime bulb.
[00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:50.672]  And the media's like, how dare you call our gracious lord, our unelected bureaucracy, the vice president of the deep state, Comey.
[00:03:51.853 --> 00:04:00.140]  The president was McCain, but his brain tumor's so bad, the president of the deep state's now Robert Mueller, the lord and savior of the left, and their unelected government.
[00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:07.768]  How dare you when he went on national TV, ABC, Comey, and said, I don't know if women urinate on the president.
[00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:08.990]  Might be true.
[00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:14.756]  Well, how do we know Comey isn't getting in the sir lines at night and eating big old piles of crap?
[00:04:15.437 --> 00:04:16.478]  I mean, I don't know if it's true.
[00:04:17.038 --> 00:04:18.360]  Maybe Comey's a child molester.
[00:04:20.622 --> 00:04:21.763]  Maybe Comey snorts.
[00:04:22.998 --> 00:04:25.040]  That's amphetamine off hooker's rear ends.
[00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:32.148]  I mean, none of that's probably true, but you can sit there and say it, but you're saying it about the president, you dirtbag, on television.
[00:04:32.448 --> 00:04:37.874]  When that whole PPGate thing was what was paid for by you and your buddies at the Justice Department, illegally sending money.
[00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:43.901]  To the head of the Justice Department's operations wife at the Fusion GPS.
[00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:45.903]  You people have no shame.
[00:04:45.943 --> 00:04:48.246]  And the deep state's fighting for its life.
[00:04:48.606 --> 00:04:50.168]  We're winning, but we're in the thick of battle.
[00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:54.913]  So cry havoc, let loose the dogs of the info war, and let them have it.
[00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:56.494]  That means press the attack.
[00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:57.956]  Don't think about who's winning.
[00:04:58.096 --> 00:04:58.437]  Attack!
[00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:07.315]  Senator Rand Paul is warning that the Trump haters at the FBI still have their top-secret security clearance.
[00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:11.697]  The senator is demanding that exposed enemies of President Trump should be fired.
[00:05:11.877 --> 00:05:22.782]  Paul tweeted out a copy of a response he was sent in March to an earlier letter where he asked whether FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page still had security clearances.
[00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:51.267]  And the response from FBI Assistant Director Gregory Brower reads, On a Fox News appearance, Senator Paul warned that this potentially means that the exposed officials, who called Trump an idiot and a loathsome human, and talked about an FBI secret society and an insurance policy for if Trump was elected, can still access information regarding the investigation, posing a potential threat to national security.
[00:05:51.527 --> 00:05:57.100]  Paul said Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were exposed as enemies of President Trump and they need to be fired.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.164]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:18.243]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:20.925]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:27.309]  You are tuned in to, either on radio, or broadcast television, cable television, or internet streams,
[00:06:44.574 --> 00:06:45.775]  Or my podcast later.
[00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:53.639]  To the most hated multimedia news transmission in the world.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.960]  Most hated.
[00:06:56.621 --> 00:06:58.102]  Most infamous.
[00:06:59.243 --> 00:07:00.383]  Most dreaded.
[00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:03.785]  By globalists.
[00:07:04.586 --> 00:07:05.326]  By tyrants.
[00:07:06.047 --> 00:07:07.127]  By authoritarians.
[00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:08.808]  By child molesters.
[00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.569]  By devil worshippers.
[00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.491]  By control freaks.
[00:07:13.342 --> 00:07:17.725]  By scumbags, by fascists, by criminals.
[00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:34.435]  Take Comedy Central and its stupid no ratings show that they admit is completely based on me and the sets and everything trying to rip off our office so they can then misrepresent who we are with fake satire.
[00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:44.587]  And then they come up and confront me on the street with total hatred and disdain, shaking in their petty wannabe elitist behavior.
[00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:47.548]  Think about that.
[00:07:47.949 --> 00:08:04.214]  You steal somebody's identity, you got a fake news show hiding behind comedy, and then four nights a week you have a program misrepresenting your prey.
[00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:08.477]  That's what they do.
[00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:28.633]  And then they make the joke, oh, Alex Jones is a crisis actor, and then say, how dare you say no children died at Sandy Hook and at Aurora and at Parkland.
[00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:35.999]  And then I explain in the raw video that's on InfoWars.com where I actually stand on that.
[00:08:37.173 --> 00:08:44.618]  And that I had debates about it on both sides, because we've seen media stage events before, and that I do believe people died at Sandy Hook.
[00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:52.363]  But that PR bandwagons jumped on it and took control of it, and didn't let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:08:52.463 --> 00:09:05.052]  But even when I told Megyn Kelly that last year, even when I said that on air three years ago, or put out a quote, final message two years ago, the media will never pick up what I actually say, because they think it's a weakness point with me,
[00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:11.100]  Because they believe I changed my stance on it, which I never really did.
[00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:14.042]  But see, that shows how they know I tell the truth.
[00:09:15.442 --> 00:09:21.584]  And so their whole world is about distorting that truth.
[00:09:23.985 --> 00:09:24.926]  That's their program.
[00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:31.008]  And they're not important enough to sit here and even talk about.
[00:09:32.577 --> 00:09:51.222]  But it's another indicator on our digital readout of life here of just how upset Viacom that brought us the nightmare of MTV and the cultural pollution of gangster rap and all the force-fed garbage.
[00:09:53.203 --> 00:09:59.545]  This is a Sumner Redstone hate letter to America with a bunch of elitist
[00:10:00.754 --> 00:10:13.241]  And talentless mercenaries attempting to demonize the American opposition to being colonized by global corporations.
[00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:22.846]  So, it's a badge of honor that these scumbags attacked me, but when I finally watched
[00:10:24.489 --> 00:10:25.350]  Segment of the show.
[00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:48.793]  I've only seen little clips before because I just it's it's it's it's just they act so conceited like a bunch of frat boys a Bunch of arrested development people that I just can't watch it the left fopping around acting smart acting snarky and Then heavily editing
[00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.986]  All of it to misrepresent what I've said and what I've done.
[00:10:55.006 --> 00:10:56.346]  And I'm not stupid.
[00:10:57.667 --> 00:11:09.295]  I can see the media building their crescendo to have families of the Sandy Hook victims sue me.
[00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:12.117]  And that's what this production is.
[00:11:12.618 --> 00:11:15.920]  These productions of the, quote, comedy shows are directed by the Democratic Party.
[00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:19.050]  Colbert admits it.
[00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.811]  Jimmy Kimmel admits it.
[00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:21.652]  Look it up.
[00:11:21.692 --> 00:11:25.034]  They have daily conversations with Chuckie Schumer, with Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:25.314 --> 00:11:27.055]  They help direct what it's about.
[00:11:29.277 --> 00:11:40.485]  And so they want to put the false idea out to the public that Alex Jones attacks children and that you can't ever question any big public event.
[00:11:41.854 --> 00:11:57.982]  And it's all part of the PR rollout to brand opposition to world government and tyranny and globalism as evil, so that other people are intimidated from being involved in the movement to restore the country's sovereignty, its prosperity, and its freedom.
[00:11:58.283 --> 00:12:00.644]  Hollywood and the globalists are a cancer.
[00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:16.674]  At the heart of this nation and other nations, openly at war with the family, openly at war with success, openly at war with independence, openly at war with any form of freedom.
[00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:24.596]  Like every other authoritarian that has come down the road in history.
[00:12:27.176 --> 00:12:28.977]  Like every other authoritarian system.
[00:12:30.103 --> 00:12:31.283]  So I'm done talking about that.
[00:12:32.003 --> 00:12:44.766]  It's just incredible to see them do edits every two seconds and then to stage part of what happened by watching the video.
[00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:45.466]  I could tell that.
[00:12:46.686 --> 00:12:49.087]  To see that they shot parts of it when it actually wasn't even there.
[00:12:49.107 --> 00:12:53.508]  They would just turn the camera on the street and have the guy talk as if he made those statements to me.
[00:12:55.899 --> 00:13:05.966]  Because I was saying Chuck E. Cheese the rat over and over again, knowing the power of memes, so that we can dub that particular reporter, I forget his name, Chuck E. Cheese the rat.
[00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:08.328]  Because he's like an animatronic rat.
[00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:10.990]  He said, don't try to give me brain force like I'm a gerbil.
[00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:18.395]  And I said, you don't look like a gerbil, you look like Chuck E. Cheese the rat, animatronic rat, plus you're a puppet, it's a perfect archetype.
[00:13:20.997 --> 00:13:23.139]  But when you see the shaking hate
[00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:32.130]  That the host of the show has, and his minions have, it's because the funding for all of these shows has been cut 60-70%.
[00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.032]  There are massive layoffs.
[00:13:37.008 --> 00:13:50.251]  Throughout mainstream media, throughout Hollywood, throughout all the corporate press, the stuff that Bezos is propping up at the Washington Post is about to implode, I can tell you that very soon, inside baseball.
[00:13:51.011 --> 00:14:00.873]  The New York Times has been bankrupt for a long, long time, propped up by Carlos Slim, the Middle Eastern Mexican kingpin.
[00:14:03.504 --> 00:14:06.805]  And so these folks are at war with the country.
[00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:09.785]  They want to dominate us like all other strongmen do.
[00:14:10.786 --> 00:14:19.987]  And they find effeminate, metrosexual culture to be the best poison to kill manhood, the family, and chivalry.
[00:14:20.868 --> 00:14:24.808]  So remember how they talk behind the scenes about bitter clingers and flyover country.
[00:14:24.828 --> 00:14:27.169]  Now Hillary publicly says she hates the Midwest.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.503]  And she hates her constituents and hates how they're baristas and want all this free stuff and she can't supply it.
[00:14:33.923 --> 00:14:38.646]  They are the ruling corrupt class that launched wars and Arab Springs and all of it.
[00:14:39.867 --> 00:14:50.513]  And the camp follower left, all went and got two or three worthless degrees at these colleges and there aren't jobs, there isn't industry, there's not even media jobs.
[00:14:51.193 --> 00:14:53.915]  And so only the most aggressive, hate-filled,
[00:14:55.399 --> 00:15:08.510]  Sycophantic, gremlin-like servants of the globalist agenda are hired, and they scrabble and claw like Stelter and the rest of them, and you see the manifestation of the bottom of the barrel.
[00:15:11.212 --> 00:15:13.193]  Of just repulsive looking.
[00:15:14.062 --> 00:15:21.309]  I don't mean even how they look, but their mannerisms, the look in their eyes, the things they say they do.
[00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:30.018]  These are horrible, fallen, twisted, truly deranged individuals who cannot stand your strength.
[00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:32.270]  They cannot stand your honor.
[00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.051]  They cannot stand your will.
[00:15:34.572 --> 00:15:45.441]  And they want to break you so bad, because then if they can break America, and if they can target Christians, and if they can make all the young people depressed under their control, they can rule over the pile of garbage they create.
[00:15:45.641 --> 00:15:48.403]  But only by pulling down the world can they rule.
[00:15:48.703 --> 00:15:49.544]  That is their spirit.
[00:15:49.984 --> 00:15:53.787]  When we come back, nuclear doomsday plane goes airborne as war fears grow.
[00:15:53.847 --> 00:15:54.268]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.502 --> 00:16:05.607]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason.
[00:16:05.827 --> 00:16:09.590]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were.
[00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.152]  What were most popular, what were best, what people liked.
[00:16:12.252 --> 00:16:14.094]  And we made it even stronger.
[00:16:14.234 --> 00:16:18.958]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[00:16:19.318 --> 00:16:21.280]  We only have a hundred and fifty percent.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.761]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:25.323]  Well now it's 50% off.
[00:16:25.863 --> 00:16:34.271]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:35.812]  Rain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[00:16:36.112 --> 00:16:37.493]  But the two go together.
[00:16:37.614 --> 00:16:39.275]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[00:16:39.635 --> 00:16:43.999]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off.
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:45.500]  I don't know.
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.281]  I'm so excited.
[00:17:00.341 --> 00:17:09.907]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:17:10.507 --> 00:17:18.793]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:17:19.013 --> 00:17:27.759]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:37.967]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:17:38.087 --> 00:17:48.976]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:17:49.476 --> 00:17:50.778]  It is amazing!
[00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:57.143]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.306]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:18:00.586 --> 00:18:01.887]  You can't survive without it.
[00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:02.967]  But where do you get it?
[00:18:03.267 --> 00:18:09.031]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[00:18:15.174 --> 00:18:32.024]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:34.545]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:36.106]  Stainless steel construction.

[00:19:07.668 --> 00:19:15.779]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:20.742]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:19:20.922 --> 00:19:27.646]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:27.726 --> 00:19:34.810]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:41.754]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:46.275]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:19:46.395 --> 00:19:49.676]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:19:49.796 --> 00:19:55.917]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:19:56.077 --> 00:19:58.298]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:05.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.104 --> 00:20:15.226]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:15.746 --> 00:20:20.971]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:22.592 --> 00:20:39.006]  Coming up, we're going to look at the accelerated collapse of Viacom, the accelerated collapse of Time Warner, the accelerated collapse of all of these major media companies except for Disney, and of course, that's merging with News Corp.
[00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:46.214]  The NFL's lost about 45% of its viewers the last three years, and guess who picked them up?
[00:20:46.294 --> 00:20:54.379]  The NBA had the highest ratings ever because they didn't allow continued urination on the veterans and the American flag.
[00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:59.281]  Oh, you've got your free speech, NFL players, little small rotten punks.
[00:20:59.882 --> 00:21:03.644]  We have ours to not watch your stinking, stupid, right-head behavior.
[00:21:05.025 --> 00:21:06.726]  Let me just continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:07.731 --> 00:21:11.753]  Coming up next segment, former CIA director tears into Trump.
[00:21:12.294 --> 00:21:14.715]  Your kakistocracy, am I saying that right?
[00:21:14.735 --> 00:21:19.758]  I guess that means a system of unqualified criminals, is collapsing.
[00:21:19.818 --> 00:21:22.760]  No, you are the globalists that are trying to collapse America.
[00:21:24.781 --> 00:21:33.787]  And never when they have Brennan or these other criminals quoted, they go, oh Brennan's the guy that illegally surveilled President Trump and then got caught lying about it.
[00:21:34.247 --> 00:21:37.189]  Brennan's the guy that was involved in all this criminal activity.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.081]  Brennan is so delusional he couldn't believe when Trump fired him and said, you'll regret this, and watch your mouth!
[00:21:47.902 --> 00:22:02.766]  The bureaucracy, it's like you're 35 years old, 40 years old, you get home and your 16-year-old son or daughter's at a party, when you left for a couple days to go fishing, and your 16-year-old says, it's my house now, Pop, and I'm gonna kick your butt!
[00:22:04.045 --> 00:22:06.926]  If you try to tell me I can't have my friends over to raid the liquor cabinet.
[00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:09.426]  Well, let's go outside, Junior.
[00:22:09.826 --> 00:22:11.847]  And that's exactly what Brennan's like.
[00:22:13.407 --> 00:22:17.028]  An old Wahhabist on the payroll of the last regime in Saudi Arabia.
[00:22:18.148 --> 00:22:19.288]  And Trump's rolling all that up.
[00:22:19.308 --> 00:22:20.689]  You know, I said that's coming up in the next segment.
[00:22:20.869 --> 00:22:24.449]  Let me get to that next segment since I mentioned it.
[00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.150]  And then I'm going to get more, again, into the collapse of the media.
[00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.791]  What you're seeing is mainstream media trying to pull
[00:22:32.765 --> 00:22:43.587]  New independent media, the free open internet, conservatism, nationalism, populism, common sense, free market behavior, really just survival instinct.
[00:22:45.648 --> 00:22:51.209]  They're trying to pull survival instinct into the mentally ill grave with them.
[00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:55.870]  You get around leftists, they all grew up in massive cities and tiny apartments.
[00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.770]  Most of them didn't have daddies at home.
[00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:13.526]  Even if they're really an alpha in their behavior and their genetics, they have a beta complex where they want to dominate everybody and they're all very neurotic, very hateful, very, very alone, very sociopathic, very psychopathic.
[00:23:15.233 --> 00:23:16.213]  And the statistics show that.
[00:23:16.253 --> 00:23:23.356]  The left, again, six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely to not give to charity.
[00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:26.057]  In the entire world, same studies, look them up yourself.
[00:23:26.077 --> 00:23:28.578]  Just type in, the left is more stingy, commits more crimes.
[00:23:28.938 --> 00:23:32.199]  That's in major liberal universities, and they go, we don't know why.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.620]  Because you're trash, that's why.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.081]  You're scum.
[00:23:37.942 --> 00:23:43.944]  You hate everybody, so you pose as a nice person so you can manipulate people that have morals under your control.
[00:23:45.984 --> 00:23:48.746]  So you can misrepresent who we are and try to guilt us all day.
[00:23:48.766 --> 00:23:56.392]  Well it's time to stop letting them define how to talk and what to do and what a family is and what words to use.
[00:23:56.452 --> 00:23:59.935]  In Europe they arrest people now that criticize Islam.
[00:24:00.355 --> 00:24:02.217]  They arrest people that say there's only two genders.
[00:24:02.657 --> 00:24:04.839]  These people mean business!
[00:24:05.659 --> 00:24:08.722]  They're easy to defeat if people just wake up and take action.
[00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:18.034]  Now I'm going to come back with Comey and all the rest of it and Trump calling him a slimeball in the next segment.
[00:24:18.054 --> 00:24:28.941]  But right now, we are 20, what, 28 hours into the worldwide emergency stop World War with Russia transmission.
[00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:45.659]  And if you're watching or listening on the radio, however you're tuned in, it is beyond imperative, it is absolutely essential that you spread the live links, the articles, the videos, if you want to crush the globalists.
[00:24:45.939 --> 00:24:51.884]  They fear this transmission because we have the enemy blueprint and we have the blueprint of prosperity to challenge it with.
[00:24:52.344 --> 00:24:58.329]  And all over the world, every election is going against the globalists, except for the few they're stealing here in the U.S.
[00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:02.152]  So we're facing their full counterattack, like Battle of the Bulls here.
[00:25:03.473 --> 00:25:04.813]  They're the Nazis' worthy allies.
[00:25:05.053 --> 00:25:06.574]  They're led by a Nazi collaborator.
[00:25:07.694 --> 00:25:12.336]  And the whole corrupt arm of the Vatican that helped Hitler.
[00:25:12.376 --> 00:25:15.277]  And the EU's run by the grandson of the head of the Nazi war machine.
[00:25:17.277 --> 00:25:27.401]  And the reason I mention that is they're always calling us Nazis because they are the money and the inclination and the will of what was left of the Nazis.
[00:25:27.781 --> 00:25:29.661]  And the whole Rockefeller-Nazi project.
[00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:31.862]  Adolf Hitler was a product
[00:25:34.378 --> 00:25:42.843]  Of IBM and a product of the Rockefeller Foundation on record.
[00:25:43.944 --> 00:25:47.205]  IBM and the Rockefellers commanded Hitler.
[00:25:49.007 --> 00:25:49.847]  And they set him up.
[00:25:49.927 --> 00:25:50.788]  Hitler was a bad guy.
[00:25:50.808 --> 00:25:51.428]  They set him up.
[00:25:51.588 --> 00:25:53.049]  He had a treaty with the King of England.
[00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:55.230]  England was going to stand down.
[00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.891]  That's why he didn't take out the British troops at Dunkirk.
[00:25:57.151 --> 00:25:58.412]  They were just supposed to evacuate and leave.
[00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:04.041]  You cannot make up the... You understand, these are realities.
[00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:16.549]  And I have Comedy Central people and all these folks, and Media Matters people funded by Soros, and Right Wing Watch, their main funder Soros, and they're in my face, and I go, your main funder is Soros, an admitted Nazi collaborator.
[00:26:16.869 --> 00:26:24.774]  The EU is run by the hereditary heir to the Nazi fortune, who still owns countries himself, Luxembourg.
[00:26:27.073 --> 00:26:33.636]  Like, you know, granddaddy took it over with Hitler so you get it, and then you're the head of the unelected EU, a Nazi project.
[00:26:33.936 --> 00:26:35.177]  This is reality!
[00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:37.418]  And they just laugh at me.
[00:26:37.438 --> 00:26:43.120]  And they've always got that, like, little fake intellectual hairstyles, and they're into acting wimpy.
[00:26:43.481 --> 00:26:50.684]  And it's like, dude, you understand you're only hired because you act like a weak beta who'll be a traitor.
[00:26:51.444 --> 00:26:54.486]  The globalists want little sycophantic lapdogs.
[00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.392]  Always look at the bodyguards Zuckerberg and others have.
[00:26:58.612 --> 00:27:01.975]  They're never real soldiers or experts.
[00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:06.178]  They're always like other little weird wimps like them because they hate fighting men.
[00:27:07.319 --> 00:27:08.420]  They hate fighting women.
[00:27:08.721 --> 00:27:11.543]  The globalists hate strength because they are weakness.
[00:27:12.284 --> 00:27:13.785]  Now I'm going to go to break, come back with the Russian news.
[00:27:14.505 --> 00:27:17.128]  Then I promise I'm going to plow through the clubs and get into Comey and all the rest of it.
[00:27:17.148 --> 00:27:18.268]  It's a jam-packed transmission.
[00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:24.153]  As you know, they are trying to shut us down.
[00:27:25.365 --> 00:27:33.346]  And they are so frustrated that they can't because of you standing with us and your prayers and the fact that you get past the censors by telling people word of mouth about the show.
[00:27:33.866 --> 00:27:37.867]  Infowars.com forward slash show, the free podcast, all of it, local stations listening to it.
[00:27:38.627 --> 00:27:41.068]  The other side of the equation is money.
[00:27:41.668 --> 00:27:42.628]  I want to expand.
[00:27:42.688 --> 00:27:45.788]  They know I'm building new studios, satellite uplinks, getting them more stations.
[00:27:45.808 --> 00:27:46.229]  They're scared.
[00:27:48.689 --> 00:27:51.369]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:27:56.448 --> 00:28:03.925]  And we have stopped the new world war with Russia specials, limited time specials, survival shield x2.
[00:28:05.908 --> 00:28:09.609]  Is going up in price, and we may not be able to source it after the next two runs.
[00:28:09.629 --> 00:28:10.549]  It's about to be sold out.
[00:28:10.829 --> 00:28:13.830]  I still have 25% off the amazing Good Halogen.
[00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:14.950]  All the others are bad for the body.
[00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:15.710]  It's the Good Halogen.
[00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.331]  If your body doesn't have the Pure Iodine, it'll die without it.
[00:28:18.771 --> 00:28:22.152]  It will try to run off fluoride, chlorine, bromide, and things like that.
[00:28:22.792 --> 00:28:25.253]  Survival Shield X2, incredible experience for yourself.

[00:29:39.096 --> 00:29:45.542]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.

[00:30:00.175 --> 00:30:00.956]  I'm not a hero.
[00:30:01.196 --> 00:30:02.237]  I have seen the enemy.
[00:30:02.517 --> 00:30:03.598]  I know how evil they are.
[00:30:03.838 --> 00:30:04.759]  I know their commitment.
[00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:06.880]  The only way is to stand against them.
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.542]  And quite frankly, I am so honored to be under attack.
[00:30:09.842 --> 00:30:11.243]  I am so honored to be demonized.
[00:30:11.504 --> 00:30:17.228]  I am so honored to be one of their main enemies because that means I'm hurting them and I want to go on hurting them.
[00:30:18.871 --> 00:30:28.675]  When I tell our incredible viewers and listeners, please stop thanking me and gushing over me, it's not because I don't want to hear your praise, it's because I'm so humbled by you.
[00:30:29.476 --> 00:30:31.877]  You're the folks that are awake and have saw through the propaganda.
[00:30:32.137 --> 00:30:34.778]  You're the reason we can still stand against the globalists.
[00:30:34.878 --> 00:30:36.018]  You are the InfoWarp.
[00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:39.260]  And what I'm trying to say is, don't think of it
[00:30:40.319 --> 00:30:42.241]  As heroic to fight the New World Order.
[00:30:42.981 --> 00:30:45.183]  Think of it as survival and a default.
[00:30:45.704 --> 00:30:55.572]  Don't think of it as Alex Jones, some hero out there on the front lines going through all these tribulations, and then you look at me as some unattainable, you know, superhero.
[00:30:55.712 --> 00:31:00.356]  I'm just an average guy that studied history, and I want to stand up against authoritarians like my ancestors.
[00:31:00.677 --> 00:31:03.219]  And you're just like me, and in many cases, better.
[00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:04.140]  No, thank you, my friend.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.901]  Look, we're all brothers in arms at this point.
[00:31:08.163 --> 00:31:10.904]  I'm a big fan of yours, and God bless you and your team.
[00:31:11.004 --> 00:31:11.924]  Don't thank me, brother.
[00:31:12.004 --> 00:31:12.504]  I get it.
[00:31:12.784 --> 00:31:14.564]  And you're the people that make the wheels turn.
[00:31:15.044 --> 00:31:16.445]  You got my respect all the way.
[00:31:16.705 --> 00:31:22.686]  From the farmers, to the mechanics, to the fishermen, to the police officers, to everybody else telling the truth and taking action.
[00:31:23.046 --> 00:31:23.906]  We are the people.
[00:31:23.986 --> 00:31:24.906]  We are America.
[00:31:24.926 --> 00:31:26.267]  This is what I was meant to do.
[00:31:26.427 --> 00:31:27.627]  I want to take the attach.
[00:31:28.167 --> 00:31:32.288]  I'm saying, though, when the enemy comes in, when evil comes in like a flood,
[00:31:32.768 --> 00:31:36.872]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it, and you are that standard.
[00:31:37.312 --> 00:31:42.918]  I'm only a focal point of somebody that understands, like somebody that's gotta swim in these boat wrecks.
[00:31:42.938 --> 00:31:47.041]  Somebody's gotta swim a hundred yards underwater to get out and get their kids out.
[00:31:47.061 --> 00:31:49.243]  They're not even good swimmers, but they're able to do it in the dark.
[00:31:49.944 --> 00:31:51.246]  It's like it's not courage.
[00:31:51.366 --> 00:31:55.411]  We're gonna die if we don't get through that damn bulkhead and get to the surface.
[00:31:56.011 --> 00:31:57.353]  You think I want to swim through these waters?
[00:31:57.613 --> 00:31:58.775]  You think I like what's going on?
[00:31:58.795 --> 00:32:00.136]  You think I personally enjoy it?
[00:32:00.537 --> 00:32:00.877]  I don't.
[00:32:01.298 --> 00:32:05.082]  But I realize I've got to do this or my family and your family's screwed.
[00:32:05.743 --> 00:32:07.205]  That's why I say, don't thank me.
[00:32:07.285 --> 00:32:08.065]  I'm not a hero.
[00:32:08.346 --> 00:32:09.206]  I don't have courage.
[00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:10.668]  I have seen the enemy.
[00:32:10.948 --> 00:32:12.029]  I know how evil they are.
[00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:13.210]  I know their commitment.
[00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:15.292]  The only way is to stand against them.
[00:32:15.473 --> 00:32:17.314]  So when you call in, celebrate humanity.
[00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:18.576]  Celebrate the awakening.
[00:32:18.976 --> 00:32:27.945]  And celebrate our own cultural and race consciousness of all humans to do better and move forward and defeat the technocrats and the anti-human globalists.
[00:32:28.285 --> 00:32:29.907]  This movement's awakening people worldwide.
[00:32:30.527 --> 00:32:32.048]  Incredible things are happening.
[00:32:32.088 --> 00:32:34.190]  Major governments now realize what's happening.
[00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:35.430]  The worm's turning.
[00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:36.811]  The fight's on.
[00:32:37.432 --> 00:32:38.472]  The empire's striking back.
[00:32:39.213 --> 00:32:40.293]  So let me do this right now.
[00:32:40.454 --> 00:32:43.996]  I want to thank you for being conscious and you for being awake.
[00:32:44.016 --> 00:32:46.517]  And I want to thank you for giving my family a future.
[00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.799]  Because we are all in this together.
[00:33:03.226 --> 00:33:07.369]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.414 --> 00:33:16.837]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:32.967 --> 00:33:37.712]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.116 --> 00:33:50.886]  Well, people always said, why didn't somebody put up a resistance against the globalists, foreign corporations, taking over nation states, using their taxes, their resources, their people.
[00:33:51.786 --> 00:33:54.488]  Their will to dominate other nations.
[00:33:55.229 --> 00:34:01.734]  America has been under globalist exploitation for more than 60 years, building a private corporate empire for ruthless individuals.
[00:34:02.315 --> 00:34:19.850]  They've taken over our industry, they've taken over our religious institutions, they've taken over the banks, they've taken over the higher education, and they have produced an anti-human, eugenics-based, post-industrial technocracy that is authoritarian in
[00:34:21.072 --> 00:34:25.354]  The Davos Group and the EU's own words.
[00:34:26.855 --> 00:34:32.438]  But they hope that they can confuse you and lie to you on CNN and MSNBC.
[00:34:33.018 --> 00:34:45.345]  And if you're the 20% that actually cares about even mainstream news, or if you're the 80% that get your news from comedy shows, well, they sit there and condescend and edit and prey on you.
[00:34:45.425 --> 00:34:46.745]  They know you're a mark.
[00:34:47.526 --> 00:34:49.327]  They know they're targeting you.
[00:34:50.779 --> 00:34:53.321]  They revel in their hatred for you and your family.
[00:34:54.002 --> 00:34:57.425]  When I say that, folks, you've heard the recordings, you've seen the spirit.
[00:34:57.665 --> 00:35:02.349]  To be bad and to do this kind of stuff to people, you have to get into it.
[00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:04.010]  They're into it.
[00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:10.476]  They're like, why would a serial killer grab little kids out of the backs of their backyards and take them into dungeons and torture them and rape them for months?
[00:35:12.332 --> 00:35:17.493]  Because a little child begging for mommy and screaming is called beautiful music to a psychopath, to a satanist.
[00:35:18.153 --> 00:35:25.495]  Raping them, torturing them, gouging their eyeballs out as they pray for mommy, and mommy never coming, that makes them feel good.
[00:35:28.235 --> 00:35:40.438]  And so to a lesser extent, you've got the cowardly psychopaths in establishment media that can't get away with stuff like that, but if they can push gender confusion,
[00:35:41.553 --> 00:35:46.336]  And teach your five-year-old boy that he should chop his genitals off and screw him up.
[00:35:46.696 --> 00:35:48.197]  That's a big vampiric win.
[00:35:50.938 --> 00:36:00.103]  If they can make you take on a whole new language of total mental illness, like a tower to Babel where no one can even communicate, and where mother and father, male and female, are a crime, they win!
[00:36:02.524 --> 00:36:04.105]  It's called depopulation.
[00:36:04.365 --> 00:36:07.727]  Okay, let's go ahead and get into the news right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:10.376 --> 00:36:12.657]  Nuclear doomsday plane goes airborne!
[00:36:13.678 --> 00:36:18.001]  As war fears grow, E4B Nightwatch allows U.S.
[00:36:18.021 --> 00:36:20.442]  to maintain chain of command in the event of a major conflict.
[00:36:20.782 --> 00:36:23.324]  Paul Joseph Watson, InfoWars.com.
[00:36:25.405 --> 00:36:31.649]  Then it breaks it all down, that these are only airborne when the DEFCON moves up towards the chance of a nuclear war.
[00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:38.753]  And of course, if you strike Russian forces preemptively, they can then strike you, and then it goes tit for tot.
[00:36:40.478 --> 00:36:51.002]  And you're into a major war, perhaps even a nuclear war, and all the top analysts of Russia studies in the US, in Europe, in Russia.
[00:36:51.603 --> 00:36:52.323]  We've had many of them on.
[00:36:52.343 --> 00:36:55.924]  In fact, we've had Princeton University professor on before.
[00:36:55.944 --> 00:36:56.945]  I've had other professors on.
[00:36:58.025 --> 00:37:09.080]  As well, Professor Emeritus of Russian Studies at Princeton University and New York University, Stephen Cohen, told Tucker Carlson last night he is more worried than he's ever been at the prospect of nuclear war with Russia.
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.602]  Here, let's just hear from him.
[00:37:11.912 --> 00:37:28.187]  More worried than I've ever been for nearly 50 years of studying and participating in US-Russian relations, I think the situation, your generation was born after the Cuban Missile Crisis, but you were taught in school, as were my children,
[00:37:28.687 --> 00:37:35.650]  That the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 was the moment when we came closest ever to nuclear war with Russia.
[00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:41.752]  And the learned lesson was supposed to be we should never get there again, and we are very close.
[00:37:41.852 --> 00:37:42.573]  And here's why.
[00:37:43.653 --> 00:37:48.215]  If Trump or somebody sends these missiles against Syria,
[00:37:49.486 --> 00:37:55.291]  There are Russian soldiers embedded in almost all Syrian army units, even in dormitories.
[00:37:56.391 --> 00:38:00.495]  If, and this I know because Moscow has said so, if Russians die...
[00:38:02.001 --> 00:38:09.989]  If Damascus is attacked, the capital of Syria, Russia will retaliate with its excellent weapons, every bit as good as ours.
[00:38:10.049 --> 00:38:13.312]  Some people say, in some regards, in missile technology, better.
[00:38:13.913 --> 00:38:14.794]  Russia will strike.
[00:38:15.595 --> 00:38:17.697]  Americans in Syria will die.
[00:38:18.217 --> 00:38:25.885]  And we will be where we have never, ever, ever been with Russia, killing each other, bearing in mind that both
[00:38:26.525 --> 00:38:29.146]  Nations are laden with nuclear weapons.
[00:38:29.487 --> 00:38:34.909]  So I am more worried than I have ever been in my life, at least since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:44.934]  But that's okay, because the mainstream media only wants parents to stand down and let the school teach their children about their sexuality and try to get them to change their sex.
[00:38:44.954 --> 00:38:52.638]  I remember 30 years ago, or longer now, in high school, hardly the old I am now,
[00:38:55.356 --> 00:39:01.807]  You had to sign a form, but your parents didn't let you go to health class because they'd show you, you know, footage of gonorrhea and stuff like that.
[00:39:03.621 --> 00:39:12.665]  In health class, but I remember thinking, oh yeah, you know, I wasn't really a leftist, but I thought, oh, these goody two-shoe right-wingers, why are they afraid of the school being involved in sex education?
[00:39:12.925 --> 00:39:14.506]  This makes sense for us to know these things.
[00:39:14.526 --> 00:39:17.107]  You know, my dad was a physician, so I already had been taught a lot of things.
[00:39:17.167 --> 00:39:18.648]  I thought it was normal to have info.
[00:39:19.148 --> 00:39:28.212]  But I didn't realize in other schools around the country at that very time, they were already in New York and other areas teaching seven-year-olds how to perform anal sex and do things I can't even say.
[00:39:28.872 --> 00:39:30.333]  And using it as a way to corrupt them.
[00:39:30.393 --> 00:39:35.358]  And now, hell, they're telling five-year-olds, you're not a boy, you're not a girl, you'll be something else, you're a little girl.
[00:39:35.578 --> 00:39:42.945]  And these liberal women want to abuse their sons, as Camille Pagli has said, as a sacrament of attacking manhood, to raise little soy boys.
[00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:44.246]  That's what they give them.
[00:39:44.286 --> 00:39:45.647]  No meat, no nothing, just soy.
[00:39:46.267 --> 00:39:46.948]  It's a religion.
[00:39:48.229 --> 00:39:49.090]  The man's never there.
[00:39:50.271 --> 00:39:55.636]  And, again, they're passing bathroom bills, where anybody can go to any bathroom they want.
[00:39:56.926 --> 00:40:02.230]  And Cuomo, you know, says, well, if your daughter doesn't like seeing a man's genitals in the shower at school, she's a bigot.
[00:40:04.292 --> 00:40:08.495]  Imagine, they want full-grown adult men to go in the showers with your ten-year-olds.
[00:40:09.476 --> 00:40:10.137]  And you're a bigot.
[00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:14.420]  See, once it's you're a bigot, give us your rights, give us your speech, give us your children.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.341]  Give it, give it, give it.
[00:40:15.601 --> 00:40:17.002]  They know what they're doing.
[00:40:17.262 --> 00:40:18.643]  They're asking for the stars.
[00:40:20.044 --> 00:40:21.506]  They're asking for a trillion miles.
[00:40:22.346 --> 00:40:23.567]  They don't care if they only get $500 billion.
[00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:32.106]  But here's the deal, they're getting what they want because these schools and facilities are cults and everyone wants to one-up the next person.
[00:40:35.088 --> 00:40:35.788]  Can you imagine?
[00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:52.937]  They said if your daughter doesn't want to see a full-grown man, the example was a news article about they're going to have transgendered men that are women in public schools showering with your daughters.
[00:40:53.939 --> 00:40:55.441]  They said, you know, the coach or whatever.
[00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:57.243]  And Cuomo said, big deal.
[00:40:58.023 --> 00:40:59.124]  That's a good thing.
[00:41:00.886 --> 00:41:05.331]  So we've got all this potential nuclear war, all the rest of it going on, but none of that matters.
[00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:08.715]  Joy Behar says Kim Jong-un and Putin have more sanity than Trump.
[00:41:11.397 --> 00:41:12.699]  So now they can't even get their story straight.
[00:41:12.939 --> 00:41:15.081]  They love a total dictator that's killed millions of people.
[00:41:16.966 --> 00:41:21.988]  ...is elected, but they say he secretly runs Trump, but now Putin has more sanity.
[00:41:22.028 --> 00:41:23.829]  These leftists can't even get their B.S.
[00:41:23.849 --> 00:41:24.109]  straight.
[00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:25.549]  Here's Joy Behar.
[00:41:26.029 --> 00:41:33.292]  ...point in this world now where we have to rely on the sanity of Kim Jong-un and Putin over the president of the United States.
[00:41:33.712 --> 00:41:34.472]  That's where we're at.
[00:41:34.713 --> 00:41:41.215]  We're hoping, because here's one of the Russian prime... one of the guys over there said, we do not do diplomacy by tweet.
[00:41:41.935 --> 00:41:42.455]  Thank you.
[00:41:42.655 --> 00:41:43.196]  Thank you.
[00:41:45.016 --> 00:41:46.457]  This isn't even congruent arguments.
[00:41:47.591 --> 00:41:49.693]  He's saying, come talk to us, stop threatening us.
[00:41:50.193 --> 00:41:51.674]  It's the threatening thing that's bad.
[00:41:53.275 --> 00:41:54.476]  But see, they want him to shut up.
[00:41:54.616 --> 00:41:56.137]  Oh, and Trump has a platform, it's bad.
[00:41:56.277 --> 00:41:57.818]  Though Behar's got her ABC show.
[00:41:58.039 --> 00:41:59.500]  See how there's all agendas here.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:41:59.760]  Here it is.
[00:42:02.124 --> 00:42:09.430]  What makes me nervous is that I don't know that this president is able to compartmentalize things in the way that a president should.
[00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:20.498]  So when he has all this Stormy Daniels stuff and his personal attorney's law firm and home being raided by the FBI, I just wonder if that is agitating him so much.
[00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:23.241]  Does he then lean towards making emotional decisions?
[00:42:23.261 --> 00:42:27.003]  Bill Clinton was famous for being able to compartmentalize things.
[00:42:27.124 --> 00:42:28.805]  Monica Lewinsky, Syria.
[00:42:29.085 --> 00:42:29.385]  Yeah.
[00:42:30.266 --> 00:42:31.526]  It wasn't Syria, you moron.
[00:42:31.586 --> 00:42:32.266]  It was Iraq.
[00:42:37.428 --> 00:42:39.849]  Ladies and gentlemen, who do you think's putting the pressure on the president?
[00:42:39.909 --> 00:42:40.650]  It's these people.
[00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:46.432]  And those harpies perched up there, betting on America to fail because they're globalists.
[00:42:46.452 --> 00:42:48.353]  They're the elites that perch on you.
[00:42:49.352 --> 00:42:49.933]  They know it.
[00:42:50.033 --> 00:42:50.874]  They talk about it.
[00:42:50.934 --> 00:42:51.655]  They enjoy it.
[00:42:51.935 --> 00:42:53.017]  They hate you.
[00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:55.940]  Because they're traitorous sacks of garbage.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.203]  Never forget, they are your enemy.
[00:43:07.483 --> 00:43:15.087]  The Times article published this week, Trump told advisers to fire Mueller following reports the special counsel's office subpoenaed his bank records.
[00:43:15.267 --> 00:43:20.129]  The Times reported that Trump believed the subpoenas crossed a red line he'd set for the Mueller probe.
[00:43:20.289 --> 00:43:28.113]  The stories about the bank subpoenas, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and Bloomberg, turned out to be inaccurate and the outlets issued a correction.
[00:43:28.353 --> 00:43:31.415]  And noting the subpoenas were for bank records of Trump associates.
[00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:32.896]  This week, the president tweeted,
[00:43:59.073 --> 00:44:03.794]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in full or his life.
[00:44:04.654 --> 00:44:05.214]  It'd take hours.
[00:44:05.514 --> 00:44:07.515]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:44:07.955 --> 00:44:08.535]  It's stronger.
[00:44:09.135 --> 00:44:10.715]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:44:10.755 --> 00:44:13.616]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:44:13.976 --> 00:44:14.776]  It's back in stock.
[00:44:15.096 --> 00:44:17.916]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:44:18.256 --> 00:44:21.617]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:44:22.037 --> 00:44:24.777]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[00:44:25.158 --> 00:44:25.878]  So you can upload it.
[00:44:26.018 --> 00:44:27.478]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[00:44:27.938 --> 00:44:35.159]  With the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[00:44:35.179 --> 00:44:36.059]  That's a spray you do.
[00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:37.020]  You can also swallow it.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:42.741]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high-quality silver, and a lot more.
[00:44:42.761 --> 00:44:44.121]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:53.742]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:44:54.082 --> 00:44:57.123]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:45:00.839 --> 00:45:09.022]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.

[00:45:59.597 --> 00:46:05.680]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:14.164]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[00:46:14.305 --> 00:46:19.027]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[00:46:19.387 --> 00:46:20.108]  We only have 150%.
[00:46:20.148 --> 00:46:21.268]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:25.410]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:34.334]  That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[00:46:34.354 --> 00:46:35.875]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[00:46:36.175 --> 00:46:37.576]  But the two go together.
[00:46:37.676 --> 00:46:39.357]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[00:46:39.717 --> 00:46:48.641]  They're both 50% off individually, or together they're 50% off, and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:49.181 --> 00:46:54.008]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[00:46:54.389 --> 00:46:58.795]  InfoHorseLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:05.444]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:11.226 --> 00:47:15.049]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.492]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:28.318 --> 00:47:29.419]  Cackistocracy!
[00:47:30.099 --> 00:47:36.503]  Your cackistocracy is collapsing, says ex-CI director as he tears into Trump.
[00:47:36.864 --> 00:47:38.505]  This is a bureaucratic position.
[00:47:39.892 --> 00:47:47.394]  Put in there by Obama, who was caught illegally spying on the candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, and then President Trump.
[00:47:49.034 --> 00:47:51.875]  Right up until the time Trump fired him under the orders of Obama.
[00:47:54.496 --> 00:47:59.157]  And John O. Brennan thinks he's God.
[00:48:00.933 --> 00:48:08.857]  Former CIA Director John Brennan, the guy that is a Wahhabist, the guy that's been caught lying to Congress, just like Clapper's in the news saying Trump's bad.
[00:48:09.477 --> 00:48:12.979]  Why do we have Clapper on the news?
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.422]  Clapper got caught lying to Congress saying the NSA's never spied on one American.
[00:48:18.402 --> 00:48:19.663]  And the moon's also made of cheese.
[00:48:21.172 --> 00:48:23.434]  And there's not only two genders, there's five million.
[00:48:23.774 --> 00:48:35.143]  Former CIA Director John Brennan on Friday went after President Trump over his attacks on former FBI Director James Comey, tweeting that Trump's taxistocracy is collapsing after its lamentable journey.
[00:48:38.145 --> 00:48:39.826]  Now let's compare reality here.
[00:48:41.247 --> 00:48:43.709]  Four plus trillion in the stock market, extra.
[00:48:43.949 --> 00:48:45.871]  They've only knocked off a trillion, so three trillion.
[00:48:46.772 --> 00:48:47.793]  Two million new jobs.
[00:48:48.153 --> 00:48:49.734]  Lowest unemployment rate ever.
[00:48:50.614 --> 00:48:52.095]  Highest small business startup.
[00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:54.417]  The most new companies coming back into the country.
[00:48:54.697 --> 00:48:57.359]  Trump fighting back against the lopsided trade deficit.
[00:48:57.639 --> 00:48:58.640]  Killing TPP.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.161]  Some say he's flip-flopping.
[00:49:00.201 --> 00:49:03.763]  No, he said, I'm taking us out of it and killing it all because it's an unfair agreement.
[00:49:04.063 --> 00:49:05.384]  We can renegotiate it later.
[00:49:06.324 --> 00:49:08.926]  And we'll do it unilaterally, nation to nation.
[00:49:09.506 --> 00:49:10.287]  Won't be secret.
[00:49:10.607 --> 00:49:11.668]  That's what he always said.
[00:49:12.722 --> 00:49:13.642]  They said he flip-flopped.
[00:49:13.662 --> 00:49:15.382]  That's one way they attack him is through the right wing.
[00:49:15.903 --> 00:49:17.063]  People want to score fake points.
[00:49:18.423 --> 00:49:20.043]  When Trump does something wrong, I'll get into it.
[00:49:20.063 --> 00:49:21.444]  But I am in the guts of this.
[00:49:21.524 --> 00:49:23.024]  I am in the facts of this.
[00:49:24.364 --> 00:49:25.324]  I'll get into that next hour, though.
[00:49:25.344 --> 00:49:26.184]  That's a whole other issue.
[00:49:26.205 --> 00:49:27.125]  Let me get back to this.
[00:49:27.145 --> 00:49:30.585]  It's just like DACA, or it's just like the guns.
[00:49:31.065 --> 00:49:34.286]  He'll say, oh yeah, tell me what you want, whatever you want.
[00:49:34.626 --> 00:49:36.586]  Not saying it's going to pass, but tell me what you want.
[00:49:37.547 --> 00:49:39.387]  Feinstein rubs her hands together like a rat.
[00:49:40.776 --> 00:49:45.457]  He meets the Wicked Witch of the East and says, well, we want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:49:46.258 --> 00:49:51.319]  And he goes, OK, well, thank you for showing your hand, baby.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.320]  He did it on DACA.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.200]  They got nothing.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.562]  He said during the campaign, he said, yeah, there might be a million people been here for decades, no criminal record.
[00:49:59.702 --> 00:50:01.442]  Let's accelerate them getting their citizenship.
[00:50:01.943 --> 00:50:05.264]  But if you have been here over and over again, you've been deported, you have a criminal record, you're gone.
[00:50:05.804 --> 00:50:06.304]  What a joke.
[00:50:07.759 --> 00:50:10.642]  The media said, he hates Mexicans and says they're all scum!
[00:50:10.942 --> 00:50:12.424]  There's no video of it.
[00:50:12.644 --> 00:50:13.565]  He didn't say it.
[00:50:14.025 --> 00:50:16.828]  Just like I didn't say there's Martian slave bases.
[00:50:21.193 --> 00:50:24.656]  Very, very, very, very fake news.
[00:50:24.716 --> 00:50:25.797]  This is what they do.
[00:50:27.659 --> 00:50:31.223]  But they say it enough to where you're supposed to believe it.
[00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:36.088]  So it's amazing.
[00:50:36.128 --> 00:50:39.972]  Now I want to get to Comey's incredible behavior on ABC to analyze this.
[00:50:40.532 --> 00:50:55.908]  Comey talks about briefing Trump on the Steele dossier, the Fusion GPS, where the head of the Russia operation of the Justice Department, Strzok, that was the FBI, the head of the Justice Department operation, gave his wife
[00:50:57.113 --> 00:50:57.814]  The contract.
[00:50:57.954 --> 00:51:02.757]  She only went to work at Fusion GPS for the Russiagate dossier.
[00:51:03.198 --> 00:51:03.998]  It's a pure fiction.
[00:51:04.058 --> 00:51:05.139]  It's admitted to not be true.
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.001]  They don't care.
[00:51:10.704 --> 00:51:13.906]  He just gets up there and says, well, I don't know if people peed on him.
[00:51:15.127 --> 00:51:25.255]  You also don't know if he flies around on Christmas Eve with Santa Claus and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Dasher and Blitzen and Comet and all the rest of them.
[00:51:26.377 --> 00:51:30.358]  I mean, you can't say that Trump doesn't fly around on Christmas Eve with Santa Claus.
[00:51:30.718 --> 00:51:34.639]  You can't say that he doesn't secretly have a little forked tail either.
[00:51:34.679 --> 00:51:37.600]  You can't say that Trump isn't drinking baby blood at night.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:42.861]  But we all know that's really the globalist and leftist and all their Aleister Crowley crap that they publicly admit they do.
[00:51:45.942 --> 00:51:46.622]  So there you go.
[00:51:48.743 --> 00:51:51.924]  We know it's the Clintons and Epstein and the Lolita Express and the kidnapped kids.
[00:51:53.899 --> 00:51:54.901]  But none of that matters.
[00:51:54.941 --> 00:51:56.543]  It doesn't matter what's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:51:56.623 --> 00:51:57.605]  It's who got them!
[00:51:57.845 --> 00:52:04.155]  And the whole story becomes that and the media parrots that until even those of us that are awake finally focus on what they're saying.
[00:52:04.335 --> 00:52:09.143]  They still have the power to bully us and to beat a dead horse to death until just by rhythmic motion.
[00:52:14.401 --> 00:52:21.127]  Oh, they get us into a trance of, yes, and then we debate that we're not Russians, instead of, what are you talking about?
[00:52:21.407 --> 00:52:23.769]  You're the ones in the WikiLeaks committing the crimes, let's remember that.
[00:52:23.949 --> 00:52:28.973]  So I think every day we should start publishing articles about, remember this WikiLeak, remember that WikiLeak.
[00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:38.380]  Maybe we should write a new article about, it's about what's in the WikiLeaks, stupid, and put that out, and hopefully Drudge would link to it, and relist the 100 top WikiLeaks.
[00:52:40.002 --> 00:52:42.544]  Remember the, we'll have the kids for entertainment in the hot tub?
[00:52:44.531 --> 00:52:47.492]  We'll have the Aleister Crowley preparation with blood and semen ready, sir.
[00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:55.156]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:56.116 --> 00:52:58.137]  But let's go ahead and go to hair combing.
[00:53:01.819 --> 00:53:05.801]  And just listen to this trying to push a book, and then Trump says you're a slime ball.
[00:53:05.861 --> 00:53:08.002]  The article's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:53:08.916 --> 00:53:11.959]  And the media's like, oh my god, they're impugning the FBI!
[00:53:12.419 --> 00:53:13.380]  How dare you!
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.883]  It's President Mueller and Vice President Comey!
[00:53:17.023 --> 00:53:23.529]  They're not elected, but they're the most important, pure, driven, snow, good boys.
[00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:25.110]  You ever seen American Psycho?
[00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:26.231]  It's very accurate how he looks.
[00:53:26.271 --> 00:53:26.932]  Super handsome.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.243]  Christian Bale, nice suit, very authoritative, tells the women what to do.
[00:53:32.924 --> 00:53:36.527]  That's just how silver-tongued, real psychopaths, high-level operatives are.
[00:53:36.787 --> 00:53:39.669]  You see, the low-level psychopaths, the ones you hear about, they get caught.
[00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.952]  The smart ones, it's admitted, get into the power structure.
[00:53:43.933 --> 00:53:46.835]  And so they got their little psycho outfits on, their little perfect suits.
[00:53:47.035 --> 00:53:47.776]  We're good boys!
[00:53:47.976 --> 00:53:48.897]  We're wearing nice suits!
[00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:53.280]  Well, we now need to call him Dear Leader Mueller.
[00:53:53.881 --> 00:53:55.422]  Dear Vice Leader Comey.
[00:53:57.552 --> 00:53:58.553]  Let's go to Lord Comey.
[00:53:58.573 --> 00:53:58.933]  Here it is.
[00:54:15.429 --> 00:54:21.912]  Allegations that he was involved with prostitutes in Moscow and that the Russians taped it and have leverage over him.
[00:54:22.212 --> 00:54:23.552]  Was there any choice there?
[00:54:25.413 --> 00:54:28.034]  Why, if this was salacious... Let's pause.
[00:54:28.254 --> 00:54:31.096]  You've got Stephanopoulos, the former chief of staff for the Clintons.
[00:54:32.016 --> 00:54:34.237]  Just like when you see Brennan or you see these people.
[00:54:35.057 --> 00:54:39.059]  Used to, if Fox was covering News Corp news, they'd say, that's our parent company.
[00:54:39.379 --> 00:54:44.321]  Or used to, people would point out, by the way, I should say this, I'm a Clinton operative, Stephanopoulos, but they don't.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.361]  It's the former Chief of Staff for the Clintons.
[00:54:47.841 --> 00:54:50.462]  Comey goes way back in the FBI with Mueller covering up for them.
[00:54:50.982 --> 00:54:53.003]  It's all one little ringleader group here.
[00:54:53.403 --> 00:54:57.365]  And they're just talking about prostitutes peeing on people when the whole thing's admitted to be fake.
[00:54:57.425 --> 00:54:59.406]  And you look at Comey's body language.
[00:54:59.726 --> 00:55:08.209]  This is a studied con man trying to not give off any facial expressions when he is lying his butt off.
[00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.250]  Let's continue.
[00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:16.231]  If this was salacious, and this particular part of the dossier unverified, still unverified by the way?
[00:55:16.511 --> 00:55:16.711]  Yes.
[00:55:17.732 --> 00:55:19.632]  So far as, when I got fired, it was unverified.
[00:55:19.752 --> 00:55:21.813]  Did you tell him that the Steele dossier... Stop right there!
[00:55:22.113 --> 00:55:23.273]  They think the audience is dumb.
[00:55:23.333 --> 00:55:24.873]  It's been admitted to be totally fake.
[00:55:25.813 --> 00:55:27.274]  But they know you don't have a long memory.
[00:55:27.294 --> 00:55:28.634]  They hope you don't, like Gruber said.
[00:55:28.834 --> 00:55:30.534]  We're here about getting our memories up to snuff.
[00:55:30.795 --> 00:55:32.575]  You can develop your memory, as everybody knows.
[00:55:33.595 --> 00:55:34.336]  Unless you forgot that.
[00:55:35.056 --> 00:55:37.478]  They're all betting you don't remember, so they play this game.
[00:55:37.658 --> 00:55:42.281]  They gotta add that as a proviso, but do it real slick, like, well, still, I don't remember since I got off.
[00:55:42.321 --> 00:55:43.162]  Well, we don't know, then.
[00:55:43.222 --> 00:55:44.202]  Oh, God, maybe it's true.
[00:55:44.583 --> 00:55:49.226]  Maybe the prostitutes, you know, projectile diarrhea all over him, too.
[00:55:49.626 --> 00:55:51.608]  Maybe Trump drank gallons of diarrhea.
[00:55:52.028 --> 00:55:55.530]  Maybe, you know, maybe he jumped out of a window and turned into a bat and flew to Pluto.
[00:55:55.891 --> 00:56:01.174]  Let's continue with the former head of the Clinton operation, Stephanopoulos, posing as an ABC news person.
[00:56:01.355 --> 00:56:02.575]  Let's hear from the political hack.
[00:56:02.756 --> 00:56:03.156]  Let's hear it.
[00:56:03.772 --> 00:56:04.593]  What a good friend!
[00:56:04.993 --> 00:56:06.314]  We're alerting you!
[00:56:06.354 --> 00:56:11.297]  He's the admitted guy that lied to Congress about leaking, and then said, well I didn't leak, I gave it to a professor.
[00:56:32.679 --> 00:56:33.800]  At a university to leak it.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.341]  That's like a mafia Don.
[00:56:35.901 --> 00:56:38.683]  I didn't kill Bobby the Bull.
[00:56:38.703 --> 00:56:45.848]  I had Rocco, one of my captains, tell some of the soldiers that I had a problem.
[00:56:46.974 --> 00:56:49.075]  They didn't take care of the problem.
[00:56:49.336 --> 00:56:51.857]  They were gonna be sleeping in the canal.
[00:56:52.177 --> 00:56:54.059]  But I didn't hurt nobody.
[00:56:54.299 --> 00:56:55.480]  Let's go back to Coleman.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.080]  Here he is.
[00:56:56.881 --> 00:56:58.021]  How graphic did you get?
[00:56:58.582 --> 00:57:00.123]  I think as graphic as I needed to be.
[00:57:00.143 --> 00:57:15.693]  I started to tell him about the allegation was that he had been involved with prostitutes in a hotel in Moscow in 2013 during a visit for the Miss Universe pageant and that the Russians had filmed the episode and he interrupted very defensively and
[00:57:21.635 --> 00:57:26.136]  Defensively, you got the FBI director telling you there's footage of you with hookers.
[00:57:26.177 --> 00:57:26.997]  It's total bull.
[00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:28.437]  Trump's a neat freak.
[00:57:28.497 --> 00:57:29.117]  It's well known.
[00:57:30.018 --> 00:57:31.158]  Just a load of crap.
[00:57:31.178 --> 00:57:34.059]  We're going to finish up with this straight ahead when we come back and so much more.
[00:57:34.519 --> 00:57:35.359]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:35.799 --> 00:57:36.939]  This is the resistance.
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.180]  We are victory.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:43.461]  Standing together against the globalists and Soros and the Hollywood filth, we will prevail.
[00:57:43.681 --> 00:57:44.982]  They will all go bankrupt.
[00:57:45.262 --> 00:57:46.182]  They will go to hell.
[00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:47.362]  We will move forward!
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:22.248]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:58:22.928 --> 00:58:38.018]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[00:59:47.231 --> 00:59:48.452]  Please, shop with the good guys.
[00:59:51.607 --> 00:59:57.595]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.342 --> 01:00:09.570]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.423 --> 01:00:41.053]  Well, it's even in mainstream news headlines, Comey got caught trying to blackmail Trump early on, trying to get the deep state back in there and try to claim with this made-up Russiagate dossier, threat fusion GPS, the Steele dossier as it's alternately known.
[01:00:42.954 --> 01:00:45.715]  Comey got caught trying to blackmail the president.
[01:00:45.735 --> 01:00:46.456]  That's what this is all about.
[01:00:46.516 --> 01:00:49.417]  He was leaking the whole time he got caught lying to Congress.
[01:00:49.477 --> 01:00:50.058]  What a criminal!
[01:00:50.831 --> 01:00:53.173]  He helped cover up for the Clintons in their crime rings.
[01:00:53.573 --> 01:00:59.919]  So the Hive got it half right with their headline, Trump thinks Comey was trying to blackmail him.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.543]  Oh no, nobody tries to blackmail the President when you're the deep state.
[01:01:05.518 --> 01:01:11.340]  No, and Chuckie Schumer never said that Deep State has seven ways from Sunday to get back at a president.
[01:01:11.941 --> 01:01:14.101]  Oh no, there's no Deep State at all.
[01:01:14.422 --> 01:01:14.942]  No, no, no.
[01:01:15.242 --> 01:01:29.728]  There's no permanent bureaucracy that's completely arrogant and sycophantic trying to start World War III with Russia and pushing Trump into it while they got all this money from Russia and got our uranium while they're openly on the payroll of the Communist Chinese.
[01:01:30.068 --> 01:01:30.648]  It's incredible.
[01:01:31.668 --> 01:01:32.689]  But here's Stephanopoulos.
[01:01:34.418 --> 01:01:42.820]  In the interview with Comey for his upcoming fiction novel, Wolf now admits his book's basically fiction, but that's later for lawsuits, they add that.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.180]  Oh, by the way, since the sales aren't good anymore, it's fake.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.761]  The known charlatan of New York, even by the liberals, Wolf.
[01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:52.261]  But don't make fun of him, he's Jewish.
[01:01:52.961 --> 01:01:54.862]  The young Turks will call you anti-Semitic.
[01:01:56.602 --> 01:01:58.022]  What does that even mean?
[01:01:59.963 --> 01:02:01.303]  Again, that's the crazies.
[01:02:01.323 --> 01:02:02.123]  Well, I guess Comey's
[01:02:04.107 --> 01:02:05.708]  Comey's just a white guy, isn't he?
[01:02:05.728 --> 01:02:07.069]  Am I bashing white guys now?
[01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:08.491]  I don't even know what Comey's background is.
[01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:11.133]  Like, you called Brian Stelter Jewish, but he's not.
[01:02:11.473 --> 01:02:13.214]  I didn't say Brian Stelter was Jewish!
[01:02:13.675 --> 01:02:14.736]  I never even thought that!
[01:02:15.016 --> 01:02:18.779]  But again, that's their whole deception on their viewers to change the subject from.
[01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:28.687]  Comey is putting out a fake dossier, got caught doing it, it's criminal what they did, and they're back recycling it again on ABC News with the former head of
[01:02:30.592 --> 01:02:32.192]  The Clinton White House, Stephanopoulos.
[01:02:32.212 --> 01:02:34.193]  There should be an advisory on him.
[01:02:34.213 --> 01:02:40.254]  You know how they want an advisory of something state-funded like NPR or PBS?
[01:02:40.354 --> 01:02:42.774]  I kind of like that, but I don't want the government in that business doing that.
[01:02:45.675 --> 01:02:46.355]  They're doing it with the Russians.
[01:02:46.375 --> 01:02:48.996]  Well, how about this person's a former political operative.
[01:02:49.016 --> 01:02:50.116]  This person works for the Clintons.
[01:02:50.316 --> 01:02:54.517]  This person was involved reportedly in the crimes and the covering up with Comey and Mueller.
[01:02:55.267 --> 01:03:03.229]  He got two old pals, two old gangsters hanging out, making something up about the Prez, because he thinks he's the Prez and not them.
[01:03:04.149 --> 01:03:04.509]  Here it is.
[01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:19.172]  The allegation was that he had been involved with prostitutes in a hotel in Moscow in 2013 during a visit for the Miss Universe pageant, and that the Russians had filmed the episode, and he interrupted very defensively, and
[01:03:21.392 --> 01:03:24.634]  I started talking about it, you know, do I look like a guy who needs hookers?
[01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:28.255]  And I assumed he was asking that rhetorically.
[01:03:28.275 --> 01:03:29.035]  I didn't answer that.
[01:03:29.115 --> 01:03:33.577]  And I just moved on and explained, sir, I'm not saying that we credit this.
[01:03:33.597 --> 01:03:35.098]  I'm not saying we believe it.
[01:03:35.198 --> 01:03:36.799]  We just thought it very important that you know.
[01:03:37.119 --> 01:03:40.780]  Did you tell him you thought it wasn't true or he didn't know if it was true or not?
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.202]  I never said I don't believe it because I couldn't say one way or another.
[01:03:45.382 --> 01:03:46.623]  How weird was that briefing?
[01:03:47.303 --> 01:03:47.883]  Really weird.
[01:03:50.464 --> 01:04:01.598]  Oh, it's really weird, I'm a Clinton operative with a whole Clinton nest that made up the dossier and paid our wives and families for it, and McCabe got a half million from Hillary, and Stephanopoulos gave $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation, blah blah blah.
[01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:02.959]  They don't tell you any of that!
[01:04:03.803 --> 01:04:06.724]  They tell you that Trump is a catnistocracy.
[01:04:06.744 --> 01:04:11.165]  That's what the CIA former director is saying when he's up to his eyeballs in illegal spying on Trump.
[01:04:11.646 --> 01:04:16.767]  It's a system of government which is run by the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous citizens.
[01:04:17.268 --> 01:04:20.709]  They have just defined their whole criminal operation.
[01:04:20.749 --> 01:04:22.329]  It's Trump that hadn't hired any lobbyists.
[01:04:22.649 --> 01:04:24.390]  It's Trump that's got incredible standards.
[01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:25.970]  It's Trump bringing the country back.
[01:04:26.751 --> 01:04:27.011]  Oh, but...
[01:04:27.611 --> 01:04:34.597]  Brennan says the country is in a total shambles, and is in a disaster, and a lamentable journey, and that the country's collapsing.
[01:04:34.677 --> 01:04:37.819]  It's the opposite, you vampire piece of trash!
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.941]  You arrogant, crazy man!
[01:04:40.601 --> 01:04:42.103]  You narcissistic twit!
[01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:45.653]  You foppish enemy of everything that's good!
[01:04:45.993 --> 01:04:47.155]  You are a failure!
[01:04:47.475 --> 01:04:48.697]  You are out of power!
[01:04:49.017 --> 01:04:50.039]  You are trash!
[01:04:50.439 --> 01:04:51.401]  Everyone hates you!
[01:04:51.661 --> 01:04:53.043]  You'll never shut us down!
[01:04:53.444 --> 01:04:53.824]  Never!
[01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:56.328]  Never, never, never, Filth!
[01:04:56.768 --> 01:04:57.009]  Never!
[01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:58.050]  You'll never break our wills!
[01:04:58.491 --> 01:04:59.032]  You'll never do it!
[01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:00.487]  You know?
[01:05:30.247 --> 01:05:31.488]  This week the president tweeted,
[01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:15.019]  Big Brother.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.801]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:17.421 --> 01:06:18.903]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:19.303 --> 01:06:20.744]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:21.004 --> 01:06:22.506]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:22.666 --> 01:06:27.370]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:32.243 --> 01:06:36.527]  It is truly bizarre.
[01:06:38.048 --> 01:06:55.883]  It is truly surreal to watch James Comey and to know how he covered up the Clinton Foundation crimes, covered up her criminal servers, open and shut perjury to Congress, open and shut perjury to the FBI, open, absconding with evidence, racketeering, organized criminal behavior,
[01:06:57.063 --> 01:06:58.964]  Illegal contributions by the billions.
[01:06:59.844 --> 01:07:02.865]  A money laundering operation, that's what the foundation is, with four billion.
[01:07:03.885 --> 01:07:04.485]  Mind-blowing!
[01:07:06.046 --> 01:07:18.550]  And then Comey, and Orr, and Strzok, and all of them, inside the FBI, set up a special project for an insurance policy.
[01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:19.090]  Remember that?
[01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:20.050]  Oh, we forgot about that.
[01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:26.372]  And pay millions of dollars to Threat Fusion GPS.
[01:07:27.915 --> 01:07:34.808]  Threat, fusion, GPS, the Steele dossier, the PP dossier, and the whole thing's admitted fake.
[01:07:35.129 --> 01:07:38.736]  If you just joined us, I played the clip from ABC News with Stephanopoulos, the Clinton operative.
[01:07:42.847 --> 01:07:49.450]  Just sitting there, in your face, lying to you, with Comey, and then Comey finishes up right here with, getting into Trump's character.
[01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:52.191]  So, Comey is like Moses on the mountain.
[01:07:52.251 --> 01:07:54.872]  Comey is the arbiter, he's the gauge.
[01:07:55.512 --> 01:07:57.653]  He's not even human, he's like an angelic figure.
[01:07:58.714 --> 01:08:02.895]  The oracle, the purest soul the earth has ever seen.
[01:08:03.576 --> 01:08:08.558]  Mueller, with uranium on tarmacs of the Russians, and being on all these Russian boards, and getting money.
[01:08:08.778 --> 01:08:09.618]  It's all good.
[01:08:09.898 --> 01:08:11.679]  Missile secrets to China, it's no problem.
[01:08:12.526 --> 01:08:14.467]  No, no, it's Comey.
[01:08:15.908 --> 01:08:20.331]  And Trump calls him a lying slimeball, the biggest leaker, the biggest liar.
[01:08:20.571 --> 01:08:21.592]  And he was caught!
[01:08:23.093 --> 01:08:24.714]  See, I don't just believe Trump.
[01:08:25.034 --> 01:08:26.515]  My head's in the game.
[01:08:29.237 --> 01:08:31.998]  We're in sudden death overtime of the country and the whole world.
[01:08:32.218 --> 01:08:34.860]  The globals are pushing us towards a thermonuclear war.
[01:08:36.141 --> 01:08:38.302]  Top analyst degree, I played it last hour.
[01:08:38.422 --> 01:08:40.624]  Top Princeton professor on Russian studies.
[01:08:42.176 --> 01:08:44.219]  And there's only what, me, Drudge, Pat Buchanan?
[01:08:49.246 --> 01:08:50.228]  Folks like Tucker Carlson?
[01:08:50.348 --> 01:08:51.430]  Tucker Carlson's really good.
[01:08:55.114 --> 01:08:58.716]  That are saying, there's no evidence the Russians did this.
[01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:00.437]  There's no evidence Assad did it.
[01:09:00.477 --> 01:09:01.758]  The rebels have been caught three times.
[01:09:01.798 --> 01:09:02.378]  They have the modem.
[01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:03.679]  The Russians are pulling out.
[01:09:04.059 --> 01:09:09.542]  Why would we blow up Russians in 70 sites, hit them with probably thousands of cruise missiles?
[01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:12.523]  They hit one target with 59 last year.
[01:09:14.424 --> 01:09:20.047]  Why'd they have seven missile cruisers, four US, three British, with thousands of missiles on board?
[01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:21.088]  Thousands.
[01:09:25.005 --> 01:09:27.827]  Each ship can carry over 100.
[01:09:28.167 --> 01:09:28.868]  700, 800, 900, whatever.
[01:09:30.068 --> 01:09:32.830]  About to launch this attack and kill a bunch of Russians.
[01:09:34.291 --> 01:09:35.972]  When the Russians are pulling out?
[01:09:37.693 --> 01:09:39.294]  The Russians went in to take out ISIS.
[01:09:39.994 --> 01:09:41.015]  They're pulling out.
[01:09:41.915 --> 01:09:44.257]  Further agreement with the Pentagon five years ago.
[01:09:44.817 --> 01:09:49.680]  And the globalists want to double-cross that and take a big fat you-know-what in the punchbowl.
[01:09:50.816 --> 01:10:00.201]  And there's Hillary and her foundation in the deep state and the globalists climbing up at the party to a big punchbowl and pulling their pants down and hanging their big wart-covered butt over the edge.
[01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:08.426]  And Trump started tweeting out, crapping the punchbowl, start World War III.
[01:10:08.446 --> 01:10:14.229]  And finally, sanity came back in, the public woke up, and the neocons backed off, along with the Democrats.
[01:10:14.269 --> 01:10:16.370]  But this is mind-blowing!
[01:10:17.811 --> 01:10:20.292]  I'm sad to use gross analogies, but I've got to get your attention.
[01:10:22.941 --> 01:10:23.262]  Okay.
[01:10:24.626 --> 01:10:29.280]  Guys, type in hydrogen bombs, Pentagon footage, Air Force footage, hydrogen bombs.
[01:10:30.538 --> 01:10:38.964]  Let's put something behind me just for the rest of the day here, for people to think, because I love little snarky comments online and the Twitter leftists, everybody, oh Alex, World War III again?
[01:10:39.085 --> 01:10:40.045]  Oh, is it going to kill us?
[01:10:40.646 --> 01:10:41.566]  Oh, how bad is it?
[01:10:41.626 --> 01:10:42.927]  Oh my God, you film on there.
[01:10:43.268 --> 01:10:44.549]  Assad is a horrible person.
[01:10:44.569 --> 01:10:45.589]  The White Helmets are good.
[01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:48.812]  I watch their show on Netflix, okay?
[01:10:49.272 --> 01:10:52.315]  We can't show you the footage of White Helmets raping women and children.
[01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:52.995]  It's online.
[01:10:53.335 --> 01:10:54.236]  Cutting their heads off.
[01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:59.020]  I was sent by the Pentagon and by Dr. Corsi stuff
[01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:03.368]  That we call the FBI about.
[01:11:03.428 --> 01:11:06.629]  I'm not even sure I could be sent this stuff a few years ago and there was no reply from the FBI.
[01:11:07.009 --> 01:11:10.110]  Just like when we get sent the most horrible, vile child porn I call the FBI.
[01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:11.710]  We called them again this week.
[01:11:12.871 --> 01:11:16.772]  Because we had the RSVP to go speak at the National Press Club and somebody was sending child porn to that.
[01:11:16.792 --> 01:11:18.193]  That's the kind of harassment we deal with.
[01:11:18.913 --> 01:11:19.353]  And I'm like...
[01:11:20.578 --> 01:11:34.706]  This is footage of people splitting people's throats, raping people to death, and because they believe it sends you to hell if you eat human flesh, making black Libyans line up and they're cutting a guy up on a table, feeding him and laughing at him, and then blowing their heads off.
[01:11:34.746 --> 01:11:35.767]  That's the footage we've got.
[01:11:36.287 --> 01:11:36.907]  Hours of it.
[01:11:37.047 --> 01:11:37.908]  I can't even watch it.
[01:11:39.608 --> 01:11:49.490]  It's little kids with their lower mandibles blown off, their tongues wagging around everywhere, going, meh, meh, they're begging for mama, and the jihadis are laughing and just slap little girls in the face.
[01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:51.711]  Little girl rolls over in blood squirting out.
[01:11:52.351 --> 01:12:00.413]  They go, and it's just like a big orgy of satanism, and they all look completely satanic.
[01:12:02.383 --> 01:12:04.184]  Do you see a Comedy Central show saying that's bad?
[01:12:04.204 --> 01:12:05.424]  Do you see an ABC show?
[01:12:05.444 --> 01:12:06.345]  Do you see a news show?
[01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:06.585]  No.
[01:12:06.985 --> 01:12:09.326]  It's all Alex Jones is bad, Alex Jones is evil.
[01:12:11.086 --> 01:12:11.927]  Now that's black and white.
[01:12:11.967 --> 01:12:15.348]  You give me color, HD, hydrogen bombs going off.
[01:12:15.608 --> 01:12:17.389]  That's Pacific bikini testing right there.
[01:12:19.389 --> 01:12:20.450]  I'll come in the break, it's no big deal.
[01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:21.250]  I'll say what I want.
[01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:23.651]  Like Trinity and beyond, it's all on YouTube.
[01:12:24.471 --> 01:12:25.492]  It's all government footage we can show.
[01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:47.787]  So, when you realize the satanic force of all this and what we're dealing with, Hillary funded the whole Arab Spring, founded it all, and they ran around killing over a million people, they blew up over a thousand churches in Egypt, and were crucifying the Orthodox and Catholic priest upside down, and CNN wouldn't even report it.
[01:12:48.107 --> 01:12:49.148]  I've got that footage too.
[01:12:49.548 --> 01:12:50.469]  I was sent by the Pentagon.
[01:12:54.612 --> 01:12:55.013]  Patriots.
[01:12:56.394 --> 01:13:05.723]  They had the government building five years ago with people crucified upside down all around it.
[01:13:06.023 --> 01:13:12.569]  Imagine, you're so satanic, you go to work, and you're the guy installed by the CIA and Hillary and Obama, and there's Christians.
[01:13:12.609 --> 01:13:13.430]  Yeah, go ahead and put that on screen.
[01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:20.397]  There's Christians crucified upside down
[01:13:24.372 --> 01:13:25.012]  All around you.
[01:13:25.733 --> 01:13:26.333]  That one there's good.
[01:13:26.353 --> 01:13:29.294]  Yeah, let's just have some hydrogen bombs going off for you here today.
[01:13:29.314 --> 01:13:32.316]  If you're a TV viewer.
[01:13:32.336 --> 01:13:36.517]  If you're a radio listener, I'm always directing the TV show in here with a great crew.
[01:13:37.138 --> 01:13:40.119]  So, that's kind of some backdrop about who we're dealing with here.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:49.743]  And, of course, he sent me this footage he got from the Pentagon, and I was sent some similar stuff, and I was like, what in the world is this?
[01:13:50.804 --> 01:13:53.205]  It's the behind-the-scenes stuff that was taken offline.
[01:13:54.116 --> 01:13:55.437]  And scooped up, scraped.
[01:13:56.178 --> 01:13:57.319]  And I mean, there's hours of it.
[01:13:57.339 --> 01:14:00.001]  You know, one day I sat up here and I made myself watch it.
[01:14:02.102 --> 01:14:02.723]  Only once.
[01:14:02.823 --> 01:14:04.244]  And I can't bring myself to play it.
[01:14:05.165 --> 01:14:08.367]  One day we played him cutting the guy up on the table and making the Africans eat it.
[01:14:09.088 --> 01:14:11.289]  And you can hear him calling him the C-word.
[01:14:11.369 --> 01:14:14.112]  I'm not going to say it because they'll edit it and say I said it on CNN.
[01:14:14.412 --> 01:14:17.394]  But it's the, it's the, it's a word they use.
[01:14:17.434 --> 01:14:18.215]  It sounds like calf.
[01:14:19.617 --> 01:14:23.400]  People go, why do South Africans, racist whites, why would they call them the C word?
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.521]  You see that in lethal weapon about South Africa.
[01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:30.005]  It's actually an accurate point where they were a diplomatic community and could do stuff and they would call people that name.
[01:14:30.445 --> 01:14:32.326]  That's an Arabic term for black people.
[01:14:33.147 --> 01:14:38.831]  And they're laughing at them while they cry and making them eat the flesh before they blow their heads off.
[01:14:43.712 --> 01:14:47.659]  A satanic religion that believes it's fighting Satan.
[01:14:47.899 --> 01:14:48.380]  How perfect.
[01:14:49.101 --> 01:14:51.105]  Let's go out to break with the best part of the worst part.
[01:14:51.145 --> 01:14:52.547]  Comey talking about Trump's morals.
[01:14:52.567 --> 01:14:52.868]  Here it is.
[01:14:54.881 --> 01:15:03.064]  And then he says something that distracted me, because he said, you know, if there's even a 1% chance my wife thinks that's true, that's terrible.
[01:15:04.085 --> 01:15:10.868]  And I remember thinking, how could your wife think there's a 1% chance you were with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow?
[01:15:11.648 --> 01:15:12.809]  I'm a flawed human being, but...
[01:15:14.089 --> 01:15:17.352]  There's literally zero chance that my wife would think that was true.
[01:15:17.872 --> 01:15:22.795]  So what kind of marriage to what kind of man does your wife think there's only a 99% chance you didn't do that?
[01:15:23.316 --> 01:15:29.060]  And I said to him, sir, when he started talking about it, I may order you to investigate that.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.181]  I said, sir, that's up to you.
[01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:36.445]  But you'd want to be careful about that because it might create a narrative that we're investigating you personally.
[01:15:37.085 --> 01:15:40.588]  And second, it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen.
[01:15:40.888 --> 01:15:42.069]  Did you believe his denial?
[01:15:42.589 --> 01:15:53.081]  I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don't know whether the... This is a guy that covered up the rest of the corrupt FBI, the Clinton sex crimes, the Clinton pedophile planes, Weiner, all of it.
[01:15:53.101 --> 01:15:58.528]  This is a guy that covered up massive child trafficking by Hillary and her people, on record, telling us about morals.
[01:16:04.013 --> 01:16:12.776]  Infowars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[01:16:13.196 --> 01:16:20.539]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:16:20.879 --> 01:16:23.620]  No longer 5% but now 10% at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:43.823]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[01:16:44.463 --> 01:16:53.785]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[01:16:54.005 --> 01:16:58.806]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[01:16:59.326 --> 01:17:08.630]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:14.213]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[01:17:14.233 --> 01:17:15.714]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[01:17:16.334 --> 01:17:22.660]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.521]  Here's my problem.
[01:17:24.002 --> 01:17:32.430]  When I do take the bodies and the extruate things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[01:17:32.891 --> 01:17:33.992]  I have the same issue.
[01:17:34.252 --> 01:17:34.392]  Yeah.
[01:17:34.812 --> 01:17:36.273]  Neurological disorders are exploding.
[01:17:36.633 --> 01:17:37.573]  IQs are dropping.
[01:17:37.633 --> 01:17:38.953]  People are in trance-like states.
[01:17:39.293 --> 01:17:41.414]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:17:41.474 --> 01:17:44.555]  And I'm glad you mentioned that, because bodies have just come back in.
[01:17:44.735 --> 01:17:46.095]  It's 25% off.
[01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:48.256]  And this has a 95 per cuminin level.
[01:17:48.556 --> 01:17:49.976]  We went out with the top labs.
[01:17:49.996 --> 01:17:52.517]  We said we want the strongest concentrate.
[01:17:53.197 --> 01:18:00.159]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[01:18:00.399 --> 01:18:01.339]  Now, your product is an extract.
[01:18:16.443 --> 01:18:19.165]  And we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[01:18:19.385 --> 01:18:23.869]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:27.652]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[01:18:28.012 --> 01:18:29.734]  The heavy metals stay in the root.
[01:18:30.054 --> 01:18:33.437]  So the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[01:18:33.477 --> 01:18:35.138]  Well, that's another reason.
[01:18:35.198 --> 01:18:42.184]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[01:18:42.324 --> 01:18:42.724]  Exactly.
[01:18:42.864 --> 01:18:49.766]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[01:18:50.046 --> 01:18:54.587]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[01:18:54.607 --> 01:19:01.649]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:03.409]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:19:03.829 --> 01:19:06.650]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:53.228]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:55.950]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:19:56.511 --> 01:19:58.833]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:05.878]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:31.078 --> 01:20:33.219]  You take a bunch of bureaucrats.
[01:20:33.939 --> 01:20:35.520]  You put them in control.
[01:20:40.542 --> 01:20:42.983]  Watch the kleptocrats go completely insane.
[01:20:47.264 --> 01:20:48.785]  Try to set up their world government.
[01:20:49.905 --> 01:20:51.366]  An ally with radical Islam.
[01:20:54.007 --> 01:20:56.308]  Watch them try to start nuclear war with the Russians.
[01:20:57.949 --> 01:20:58.869]  Watch them tell you that
[01:20:59.781 --> 01:21:03.362]  The word mother's now been banned in government documents in Canada!
[01:21:04.202 --> 01:21:06.202]  I first read about that plan 10 years ago, couldn't believe it.
[01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:07.263]  Now it's happened!
[01:21:07.743 --> 01:21:08.823]  And now it's happening here.
[01:21:11.023 --> 01:21:12.784]  These people mean business.
[01:21:13.904 --> 01:21:15.764]  They mean business big time.
[01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:20.785]  Nuclear doomsday plane goes airborne as war fears grow.
[01:21:22.606 --> 01:21:24.966]  E-4B Nightwatch allows U.S.
[01:21:24.986 --> 01:21:27.567]  to maintain chain of command in event of a major conflict.
[01:21:27.607 --> 01:21:28.807]  The jets go airborne.
[01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:33.036]  And the threat of nuclear war is at a very high level.
[01:21:33.876 --> 01:21:55.880]  I want to open the phones up specifically on the outrageous coming, rebooting the fake PP dossier, the Steele dossier they meant as fake, that his criminal network and the FBI, very small group, funded illegally with taxpayer money to their own wives, who only got hired to run it.
[01:21:57.065 --> 01:21:59.786]  And Hillary peeled off a half mill to McCabe's wife.
[01:22:01.886 --> 01:22:05.267]  You're not going to see any raids on McCabe, though it's being looked at.
[01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:06.228]  You're not going to see any of this.
[01:22:06.628 --> 01:22:07.148]  No, no, no.
[01:22:07.208 --> 01:22:11.149]  It's just on Stormy Daniels and 11 years ago.
[01:22:11.169 --> 01:22:13.770]  And then did Trump have sex with a woman?
[01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:21.132]  That's, oh, Comey earlier, we just joined us, talked about how immoral it is and how his, oh my God.
[01:22:21.472 --> 01:22:22.572]  Oh, Trump is so bad.
[01:22:23.192 --> 01:22:24.773]  Even though the PP dossier is not true.
[01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:41.322]  When Comey and Mueller and all the rest of these people, the mainstream media, covered up the Epstein aircraft with the little girls and all the people, Weinstein and Bill Clinton and Hillary.
[01:22:41.622 --> 01:22:47.786]  They didn't just do dozens of flights to the little island where little girls are taken, as young as 10 years old confirmed.
[01:22:47.806 --> 01:22:52.649]  Reportedly, some were bad when sleeping with the little fishy-wishies.
[01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.750]  No.
[01:22:55.239 --> 01:22:57.154]  It's more liberal and loving than that.
[01:22:59.537 --> 01:23:08.142]  No, my friends, they would go to special sheiks' houses in the Middle East who have it legalized in their country to have harems of little children and women.
[01:23:08.542 --> 01:23:15.046]  A lot of them are women that are in the hospitality industry who thought they were going to work in one of these countries and the sheik liked you.
[01:23:15.826 --> 01:23:26.012]  And just like his father and his father and his father back to the founding of the great jihad, went to Spain and other areas, went to Greece.
[01:23:27.272 --> 01:23:31.775]  Went to Italy, even to the gates of Rome, to take the women back.
[01:23:33.897 --> 01:23:36.638]  And to give them the freedom of Islam.
[01:23:37.899 --> 01:23:41.882]  To give them the freedom of being in the torture chamber.
[01:23:43.783 --> 01:23:46.104]  The harem full of the women.
[01:23:48.826 --> 01:23:52.489]  And your women are ours, don't you worry about that.
[01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.071]  Good for you.
[01:23:56.724 --> 01:24:00.029]  Now, I want to give the number out.
[01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:03.033]  On this open line Friday, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:24:03.053 --> 01:24:03.313]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:24:03.333 --> 01:24:03.393]  877-789-2539.
[01:24:03.433 --> 01:24:05.316]  First time callers in the first round.
[01:24:05.336 --> 01:24:05.977]  Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[01:24:14.537 --> 01:24:21.079]  Who used to be the head of psychological operations, he's a psychiatrist and a medical doctor and a bunch of other stuff from the State Department.
[01:24:21.119 --> 01:24:25.320]  Of course, the State Department runs the CIA, so he wouldn't be in the CIA, he was in the group that ran the CIA.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.721]  Does anybody like to talk about being in the CIA being so cool?
[01:24:28.681 --> 01:24:32.962]  No, that's, the CIA's bigger than Coca-Cola, and it's not bad if you were in the CIA.
[01:24:32.982 --> 01:24:36.363]  There's a lot of people in there that aren't bad people, but at the top it's a bunch of globalists.
[01:24:36.384 --> 01:24:40.985]  I mean, they use real men and real women to do the fighting and the killing and everything else.
[01:24:42.159 --> 01:24:49.466]  Because they're a bunch of cowards that sit around talking about how powerful they are, like Clapper and Brennan and all these little knuckle-dragging demons.
[01:24:52.489 --> 01:24:56.713]  But all the people I ever talked to that were in the CIA, even going back to when I was a kid,
[01:24:58.632 --> 01:25:13.705]  Talked about how bad the globalists were in the New World Order, and how great the John Birch Society was, and how we were going to stop their world government and their cashless society, and that there'd be a Pope coming up who'd call for world government and basically deny Christ and all of its happening.
[01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:24.375]  One thing the globalists do, I've got an article here today about, is the end of the world here, Sunday Express,
[01:25:25.609 --> 01:25:29.910]  And they can always find some church or somebody obsessed with numerology who's saying, this is the date.
[01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:31.991]  I can't tell you how many times that's happened in my life.
[01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:34.872]  Well, the Bible says, watch out.
[01:25:35.592 --> 01:25:37.492]  In fact, pull up the quotes if we can.
[01:25:37.953 --> 01:25:41.634]  Watch out for those that say they know the hour of the time, for no man knoweth the time.
[01:25:42.014 --> 01:25:47.095]  And those that tell you they know the time are false prophets, because Christ will come like a thief in the night.
[01:25:51.717 --> 01:25:52.857]  And we're all raptured by
[01:25:55.339 --> 01:25:58.421]  The gravity weapon being released and the whole solar system evaporating instantly.
[01:26:01.783 --> 01:26:02.704]  Anyways, continuing.
[01:26:03.064 --> 01:26:04.986]  End of the world 2018.
[01:26:05.546 --> 01:26:08.028]  Will the rapture occur on April 23rd?
[01:26:08.468 --> 01:26:09.869]  Shock prediction says.
[01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:17.434]  According to conspiracy theorists, that means people that question, when it's a mainline orthodoxy, then it's hmm.
[01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:22.938]  Codes in the Bible suggest the end of the world is imminent, with Earth set to be destroyed April 23rd.
[01:26:25.728 --> 01:26:30.429]  Well, I can't say the Earth doesn't deserve it, but there's still a lot of innocence on the planet, so I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:26:31.369 --> 01:26:37.831]  But, we could really have another Atlantean moment, whether you believe in Atlantis or not, where we destroy most life on Earth.
[01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:40.651]  You know, Plato wrote a lot of stuff that was true.
[01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:44.912]  He's also the father of eugenics, the father of modern elitism and royalty and the whole nine yards.
[01:26:45.452 --> 01:26:47.953]  Chief of the architecture we now live under.
[01:26:47.973 --> 01:26:51.214]  You could call him the leader.
[01:26:52.054 --> 01:26:52.654]  Der Fuhrer.
[01:26:54.261 --> 01:26:58.465]  Probably the most important man that's ever lived, other than Christ, who was no man, as we know.
[01:27:00.767 --> 01:27:06.692]  But God, avatared on the planet, jacked in to walk amongst us.
[01:27:07.733 --> 01:27:08.753]  Now it all makes sense, doesn't it?
[01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:13.658]  And the globalists all know that, and they put it out in their cosmologies now, in movies, everywhere, they get it now.
[01:27:13.698 --> 01:27:15.719]  They're like, oh my God, this is all real, it's all coming true.
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:20.904]  And now they've all adopted the Bible, but they think they're gonna use it as a cheat sheet to get out of it.
[01:27:23.035 --> 01:27:27.560]  There's not a Hollywood or a top engineer or not a globalist that doesn't know what's going on, folks.
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:28.020]  They know.
[01:27:28.581 --> 01:27:28.941]  They know.
[01:27:29.181 --> 01:27:30.903]  But they've picked the wrong side.
[01:27:32.825 --> 01:27:33.866]  The god of this world.
[01:27:35.188 --> 01:27:38.791]  The tin horn psychic interdimensional dictator.
[01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:44.117]  That they think is a god and they're gonna follow right into hell.
[01:27:46.755 --> 01:27:50.496]  Don't fear those that can kill the body, fear those that can kill the soul.
[01:27:50.596 --> 01:27:52.576]  And as I said, if you pull up, can we pull up the Bible verse?
[01:27:52.596 --> 01:27:53.216]  I don't know the exact.
[01:27:55.317 --> 01:27:56.297]  No man, no at the time.
[01:27:57.037 --> 01:27:58.137]  But it's this constant thing.
[01:27:58.177 --> 01:28:06.939]  And then, I was picking up Italian food about five years ago, and it was that other big church that said the other world was coming, and the media made fun of the old guy and all that.
[01:28:07.899 --> 01:28:10.460]  And I was in there getting food one night, about 6.30, taking it home.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.620]  My wife wanted Italian food.
[01:28:18.897 --> 01:28:20.358]  Guy behind the counter giving it to me.
[01:28:20.819 --> 01:28:22.820]  He's had a glass of wine while I was waiting for the food to come.
[01:28:24.261 --> 01:28:25.622]  He goes, Alex, I see your show and all this.
[01:28:25.642 --> 01:28:27.063]  You don't really agree with these dumb Christians, do you?
[01:28:27.384 --> 01:28:29.305]  You know, because they just said the world was going to end last week.
[01:28:29.345 --> 01:28:29.705]  It didn't end.
[01:28:29.725 --> 01:28:30.346]  Do you believe that?
[01:28:30.426 --> 01:28:32.127]  I said, that's all pushed by the media.
[01:28:32.147 --> 01:28:34.949]  Just because some quack says something doesn't mean that's the case.
[01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:39.993]  But if you don't think the stuff in Revelations, world government, a mark to buy and sell,
[01:28:41.078 --> 01:28:48.401]  Giant mountains of fire that destroy whole armies of giant flying metal insects that fire flaming spears out, helicopters.
[01:28:48.641 --> 01:28:54.823]  You don't go look at Egyptian tombs with perfect Cobra attack helicopters carved on the wall and it's like, something's going on!
[01:28:54.843 --> 01:28:56.043]  Something's going on!
[01:28:56.103 --> 01:28:57.504]  I don't know what, but it's big!
[01:28:59.289 --> 01:29:03.151]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:29:03.711 --> 01:29:11.115]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:29:11.815 --> 01:29:16.518]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:29:17.138 --> 01:29:19.039]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:29:19.659 --> 01:29:23.101]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:29:23.902 --> 01:29:26.363]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:29:27.043 --> 01:29:33.687]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:29:34.288 --> 01:29:41.532]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:29:42.392 --> 01:29:49.036]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:50.697]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:29:51.058 --> 01:29:52.879]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.669]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:29:57.211 --> 01:29:58.936]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:07.567]  Andrei Afanasyev is our guest for the next 45 minutes, and I don't watch a lot of Russian television.
[01:30:07.587 --> 01:30:11.549]  I don't watch a lot of British television or German TV, but I recognize this guy.
[01:30:11.569 --> 01:30:13.871]  He's all over national television.
[01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:20.355]  He's a journalist, TV host, and head of political department at Russia's first independent pro-Christian conservative political TV channel.
[01:30:20.395 --> 01:30:28.120]  Previously worked for RT and currently authors and hosts the show Russian Answer, a daily digest and analysis of the most important political news.
[01:30:30.762 --> 01:30:32.044]  We're good to go.
[01:30:47.423 --> 01:30:53.448]  Just as the robber barons financed the takeover of Russia, and then used Russia in the exploitive phase to take over much of the world.
[01:30:53.568 --> 01:31:17.346]  First of all, we're in a state of a global civil war, as you said, between globalists, in support of a global liberal market, and controlled by the global government, and nationalists, conservative traditionists, who just want to live their lives as their fathers did, on their land, and not attacking and fighting with each
[01:31:17.906 --> 01:31:24.891]  The thing is that in the whole world, in any country in the world, there are now these two camps, but there are different shares of such people.
[01:31:25.011 --> 01:31:39.260]  And, for example, Europe is almost totally controlled now by these people, politically, but the people of Europe, or I mean ordinary people, some of the military servicemen, are usually populists.
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:44.524]  And we see now that in some countries, for example, in Eastern Europe, in Hungary,
[01:31:45.004 --> 01:31:49.367]  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, now Austria.
[01:31:49.768 --> 01:31:58.334]  We see populists, pro-nationalists, pro-sovereignty governments winning and forming the majority.
[01:31:58.374 --> 01:32:01.136]  Globalists, they work like a typical parasite.
[01:32:01.276 --> 01:32:03.357]  They need a body to operate inside.
[01:32:03.397 --> 01:32:09.342]  They cannot form their own army, at least by now, thank God, of, like, globalists.
[01:32:09.642 --> 01:32:13.625]  They infect, they infest different societies, different groups.
[01:32:14.125 --> 01:32:36.888]  Groups of people and make them do whatever they want and whatever they need and I can also tell you that to my mind the only reason why globalists work so hard to block the US and Trump and Trump supporters from being in better relations with Russia is because Russian experience is
[01:32:36.988 --> 01:32:44.033]  Putin delivered a recovery, Trump does it, nationalism families back and we win and the whole nightmare doesn't have to happen like he went through.
[01:32:44.353 --> 01:32:46.014]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:32.486]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:33.847]  50,000 unstoppable watts!
[01:33:36.368 --> 01:33:38.309]  Anthrax on radio!
[01:33:45.330 --> 01:33:46.090]  All right, welcome back.
[01:33:46.110 --> 01:33:47.231]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:33:47.331 --> 01:33:48.712]  I've already hit some of the news.
[01:33:48.732 --> 01:33:49.872]  There's so much more here.
[01:33:51.753 --> 01:33:53.974]  You know, here's the deal.
[01:33:56.856 --> 01:33:59.917]  I was brought up to be extremely tolerant of everybody.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:12.644]  And then I studied history, and I saw how all these other groups are extremely militaristic, tribalistic,
[01:34:14.358 --> 01:34:31.535]  monotheistic, barbaristic, piratical, fanatical, delusional, usurpers.
[01:34:34.518 --> 01:34:37.621]  There are more than 50 Muslim countries
[01:34:41.018 --> 01:34:44.682]  There's Muslim countries, and then no other religion is basically allowed.
[01:34:44.702 --> 01:34:50.489]  The fewer it is, our government's trying to overthrow it and turn it over to the radical jihadis, from Egypt to Syria.
[01:34:52.331 --> 01:34:53.352]  There's two different types of countries.
[01:34:53.372 --> 01:34:55.935]  There's Islamic countries, and there's not Islamic countries.
[01:34:56.963 --> 01:35:25.494]  And then I look at the doubling of Christian persecution last decade, and Obama honchoing that, and the Pope coming out and bad-mouthing, and being a globalist, and Apple and Google delisting Easter and other Christian holidays, and just the animus, and I'm sitting here going, and then now the family's bad, and mother and father, and it's not just the universities, it's everywhere, and these people are on power trips, and they're criminals, and I'm not even talking about the Muslims there, but the sick, nihilistic,
[01:35:26.784 --> 01:35:30.986]  Freakazoid left.
[01:35:32.206 --> 01:35:33.727]  I mean, we've all gone to leftist rallies.
[01:35:33.847 --> 01:35:34.767]  I mean, they're ugly.
[01:35:34.927 --> 01:35:35.708]  They're stupid.
[01:35:35.748 --> 01:35:36.548]  They can't talk.
[01:35:36.948 --> 01:35:37.969]  No one will talk to you.
[01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:39.489]  They only have talking points.
[01:35:40.290 --> 01:35:41.410]  They act mentally ill.
[01:35:43.831 --> 01:35:45.852]  The higher caste is vicious.
[01:35:48.848 --> 01:36:03.580]  The kind of professor, management class, and you're like, my God, these are people that bought into the New World Order, bought into globalism, bought into their post-modernism, and they, I just keep going back to this, they hate you, okay?
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:16.290]  I just want to keep, like an emergency beacon, they hate you, they hate you, they hate you, they want to take what you got, they want to kill you, they want to destroy you, they are just, and it's the realization that there aren't any liberals anymore.
[01:36:18.123 --> 01:36:22.587]  Liberals used to have a lot of good points about free speech and anti-war and good things.
[01:36:22.967 --> 01:36:24.348]  Those were classical liberals.
[01:36:24.548 --> 01:36:25.149]  They're gone.
[01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:32.635]  Because through virtue signaling, through political correctness, they by successive approximation, by increment,
[01:36:34.881 --> 01:36:40.982]  Have gotten the average Democrat to accept anything, and now you open up mainline newspapers.
[01:36:41.302 --> 01:36:42.443]  Whites are inherently bad.
[01:36:42.703 --> 01:36:43.583]  Christians are bad.
[01:36:43.883 --> 01:36:44.883]  The family is bad.
[01:36:44.943 --> 01:36:46.703]  And you're like, where do they go next?
[01:36:47.284 --> 01:36:48.124]  Arresting people?
[01:36:49.004 --> 01:36:50.024]  Forced re-education?
[01:36:55.145 --> 01:36:56.405]  I've had these lepers on the air.
[01:36:56.465 --> 01:36:57.706]  I've been out to dinner with them years ago.
[01:36:57.726 --> 01:37:03.907]  And they'll always invariably say, Alex, if you don't get what we want, we're going to put you in a re-education camp.
[01:37:07.230 --> 01:37:13.998]  And they invariably sit there and go, Alex, we're not really liberal civil rights activists, we're communists and we're going to kill a bunch of people when we take over.
[01:37:16.826 --> 01:37:26.772]  And me and Rob Dewar were sitting there at dinner once with a prominent civil rights activist, and they had three or four tequilas, and they're talking about how much they want to murder everybody.
[01:37:27.513 --> 01:37:30.715]  And you know, the first couple times that happens, you think, oh, we got a bad apple.
[01:37:31.175 --> 01:37:31.355]  No.
[01:37:31.836 --> 01:37:35.118]  Those of us that aren't ravenous demons are blind.
[01:37:35.778 --> 01:37:38.500]  We do not understand what we're up against.
[01:37:39.881 --> 01:37:47.705]  Why would the neocons and the Democrats want to blow up the Russians when they're trying to exit Syria when we know the rebels have staged it at least three times?
[01:37:48.165 --> 01:37:49.386]  Why would we do that?
[01:37:50.546 --> 01:37:51.787]  Why would they rush to do it?
[01:37:52.247 --> 01:37:54.068]  Why would they know the Russians will retaliate?
[01:37:55.249 --> 01:37:57.510]  Because it's thrilling to psychopaths.
[01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:08.351]  To push Russia, like they pushed them out of Iraq, and they pushed them out of Libya, and they pushed them out of Serbia, and they let the Muslims, the radical Muslims, take over everywhere.
[01:38:08.391 --> 01:38:10.452]  You see where the globals are allied for a long time now.
[01:38:10.752 --> 01:38:12.273]  Demographically, they've decided to go with them.
[01:38:12.473 --> 01:38:14.334]  There'll be 3 billion Muslims by 2025, according to the UN.
[01:38:18.570 --> 01:38:30.032]  And every Muslim that lets Christians and Jews and others live in peace, that tries to put in hotels, and swimming pools, and lets people have rock and roll music, every one of them gets killed or overthrown.
[01:38:30.672 --> 01:38:38.534]  Except for Assad, whose father did some bad stuff, and I didn't agree with him, and Assad's been a dictator, he's trying to phase out.
[01:38:38.934 --> 01:38:43.775]  He thought the West, same time Gaddafi 10 years ago, 11 years ago thought, oh,
[01:38:44.997 --> 01:38:45.838]  You want to work with us?
[01:38:45.898 --> 01:38:47.260]  Sure, we'll modernize, we'll let you in.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:50.704]  It was all a double-cross to let the operatives in to set them up.
[01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:57.073]  So we're going to go to break.
[01:38:57.093 --> 01:38:57.994]  We're going to come back with your calls.
[01:39:00.015 --> 01:39:05.159]  We're going to go to Jason and Mark and Katherine and Jason and Caroline and Brandon and many others.
[01:39:05.579 --> 01:39:07.741]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:39:08.301 --> 01:39:09.282]  What do you think about Comey?
[01:39:09.322 --> 01:39:11.063]  What do you think about all the craziness?
[01:39:11.103 --> 01:39:15.386]  The constitutional crisis, the out-of-control special counsel, the China trade war.
[01:39:15.786 --> 01:39:17.087]  China's trade surplus with the U.S.
[01:39:17.228 --> 01:39:17.688]  soars!
[01:39:18.729 --> 01:39:21.050]  Yeah, it used to be $500 billion a few years ago.
[01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:22.071]  Now it's $900 billion.
[01:39:22.131 --> 01:39:24.913]  And Trump's trying to stop the bleeding.
[01:39:24.933 --> 01:39:25.714]  There's almost nothing left.
[01:39:26.547 --> 01:39:29.054]  And the media's like, shut up, you horrible person!
[01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:33.246]  They got $900 billion on us, you don't put $50 billion on them!
[01:39:33.547 --> 01:39:34.890]  That's not fair, racist!
[01:39:41.311 --> 01:39:44.374]  I mean, that's all Trump really is, like a tourniquet on our leg, chopped off.
[01:39:44.694 --> 01:39:47.496]  And the media and everybody else is like, no, no, no.
[01:39:48.077 --> 01:39:54.222]  Take the tourniquet off, because we're going to bankrupt America, and we're going to teach the bitter clingers, everybody else, how to come to heel.
[01:39:54.682 --> 01:39:57.525]  You all got worthless degrees, by design, declassified.
[01:39:57.825 --> 01:39:59.246]  You've all got a screwed up culture.
[01:39:59.686 --> 01:40:08.494]  Everything's been shut down, and you're still fighting to keep that little farm, and still fighting to work at the gas station, and still fighting to fly Old Glory, still fighting to go to church.
[01:40:11.018 --> 01:40:12.639]  We're gonna flood your community with opium.
[01:40:12.679 --> 01:40:13.379]  How do you like that?
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:15.881]  We're gonna flood it with MTV.
[01:40:16.421 --> 01:40:18.482]  We're gonna flood it with all this trash.
[01:40:21.784 --> 01:40:24.145]  Because they've hired all this scum to be mercenaries.
[01:40:26.564 --> 01:40:30.706]  And they sit there and psychologically know how to track them and their web history and who they are.
[01:40:31.106 --> 01:40:32.227]  They got it down in algorithms.
[01:40:33.067 --> 01:40:42.171]  And boy, they got an algorithm on me, and I'm not saying I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread, but their algorithm came up with me, and they said, stop that guy right there.
[01:40:43.172 --> 01:40:44.052]  They're like, well, we'll kill him.
[01:40:44.112 --> 01:40:45.113]  They're like, that'll make him a martyr.
[01:40:45.473 --> 01:40:47.434]  Kill his name first, then we'll kill him.
[01:40:49.701 --> 01:40:54.386]  Well, just like you arrogant people thought you'd steal the election and all the rest of that stuff, you're not in charge.
[01:40:54.786 --> 01:40:55.768]  Human will is.
[01:40:56.468 --> 01:40:58.390]  And God is when we ask God into the equation.
[01:40:58.691 --> 01:41:02.675]  So it's time to get on our knees and seek God's face and repent for what we've done.
[01:41:03.216 --> 01:41:04.077]  And God will come in.
[01:41:05.734 --> 01:41:07.916]  And Lee gotta direct us, but you've gotta have courage.
[01:41:08.016 --> 01:41:11.659]  And here's the thing, once you really get discernment, you go, oh my God, it isn't even courage.
[01:41:12.059 --> 01:41:13.200]  How did I not fight this before?
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:14.461]  They're so evil, they're so bad.
[01:41:14.642 --> 01:41:15.282]  We gotta fight!
[01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:17.484]  Because you know they're coming and they're bad.
[01:41:17.524 --> 01:41:20.166]  It's not courage, it's self-preservation.
[01:41:20.186 --> 01:41:21.087]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:41:21.628 --> 01:41:23.209]  I don't have courage, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:23.529 --> 01:41:24.530]  I've seen the enemy.
[01:41:25.551 --> 01:41:26.211]  We gotta fight!
[01:41:27.112 --> 01:41:27.893]  It's all we got!
[01:41:28.714 --> 01:41:30.155]  And if we fight, we're gonna win!
[01:41:33.336 --> 01:41:37.098]  For God's sake, though, break their conditioning and come out of the trance and let's beat them because they're bad news.
[01:41:37.978 --> 01:41:41.160]  Now, we can stand against the Soros-funded lawsuits.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:41.960]  We know he's funding them.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.962]  Because they're all ridiculous and we're getting them thrown out, but it costs money and it takes research and it's meant to weigh us down on our time.
[01:41:46.982 --> 01:41:52.885]  I need people to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get products you already need so it's a win-win.
[01:41:53.045 --> 01:41:53.605]  Just do it.
[01:41:53.965 --> 01:41:56.747]  If you haven't ever supported us, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:41:56.987 --> 01:42:00.028]  Water filters, air filters, non-GMO, heirloom seeds, a wide selection.
[01:42:00.368 --> 01:42:00.969]  One of the widest.
[01:42:01.029 --> 01:42:01.549]  High quality.
[01:42:03.993 --> 01:42:12.580]  We are going to sell out a pure, affordable, high-quality iodine, Survival Shield X2, the next generation of super-high-quality nascent iodine.
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.143]  And the price is going up, and we're over a barrel with the suppliers.
[01:42:16.183 --> 01:42:16.704]  It's deeper.
[01:42:16.744 --> 01:42:17.925]  Nobody else has this source.
[01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:21.888]  And I don't like the fact that, you know, it's sold out a lot because we can't get it.
[01:42:21.908 --> 01:42:23.129]  I don't know what we're going to do.
[01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:24.350]  I don't know how long we'll even have X2.
[01:42:24.450 --> 01:42:25.951]  And I hate to have to announce that news.
[01:42:25.971 --> 01:42:26.752]  People are buying it up.
[01:42:27.292 --> 01:42:30.175]  We've got enough for a few more manufacturing runs, and then I don't know.
[01:42:31.385 --> 01:42:32.406]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:32.426 --> 01:42:36.307]  If you want X2 and you see what it's done for you and others or heard what it's done, try it out today.
[01:42:36.948 --> 01:42:37.688]  Stay big on it.
[01:42:37.708 --> 01:42:42.090]  25% off despite the fact it's selling out and it may be gone forever after two more runs.
[01:42:42.891 --> 01:42:46.733]  PageRant point rewards at InfoWarsTore.com aren't five points for every dollar.
[01:42:46.753 --> 01:42:47.893]  They're 5%.
[01:42:48.073 --> 01:42:48.553]  They're now 10%.
[01:42:48.593 --> 01:42:49.094]  That's huge.
[01:42:49.654 --> 01:42:50.254]  Check that out.
[01:42:50.534 --> 01:42:52.115]  We got a lot of other specials right now.
[01:42:52.195 --> 01:42:55.217]  Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula is back in.
[01:42:55.237 --> 01:42:55.757]  25% off as well.
[01:42:55.877 --> 01:42:57.358]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:57.398 --> 01:42:57.698]  Thank you.
[01:42:59.713 --> 01:43:00.313]  Alphapower.
[01:43:00.673 --> 01:43:01.474]  Here's what you want to know.
[01:43:01.714 --> 01:43:07.696]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[01:43:08.356 --> 01:43:11.897]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[01:43:12.778 --> 01:43:20.720]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:24.642]  The average male or female enhancement
[01:43:25.602 --> 01:43:28.324]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[01:43:28.864 --> 01:43:30.585]  It just has a little bit in it.
[01:43:30.925 --> 01:43:36.028]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[01:43:36.308 --> 01:43:43.932]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product.
[01:43:44.352 --> 01:43:44.633]  In them.
[01:43:45.053 --> 01:43:46.074]  Nobody else does that.
[01:43:46.154 --> 01:43:48.878]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[01:43:49.218 --> 01:43:51.241]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:56.968]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:43:59.744 --> 01:44:03.206]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[01:44:03.506 --> 01:44:10.229]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[01:44:10.549 --> 01:44:15.291]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[01:44:15.311 --> 01:44:15.832]  It's very simple.
[01:44:16.052 --> 01:44:16.952]  We went out and looked.
[01:44:16.992 --> 01:44:17.552]  What is the top?
[01:44:17.633 --> 01:44:18.193]  What is the best?
[01:44:18.553 --> 01:44:19.774]  We'll just put even more product in.
[01:44:19.794 --> 01:44:20.394]  We'll make it better.
[01:44:20.494 --> 01:44:22.255]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[01:44:22.295 --> 01:44:23.355]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:44:23.475 --> 01:44:24.216]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:44:29.138 --> 01:44:32.040]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:36.323]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[01:44:36.623 --> 01:44:40.446]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[01:44:40.486 --> 01:44:43.888]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:44:44.348 --> 01:44:47.270]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:50.913]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[01:44:51.153 --> 01:44:53.454]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[01:44:53.754 --> 01:44:54.455]  It's amazing.
[01:44:54.755 --> 01:44:57.257]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or AAA2533139.
[01:44:59.738 --> 01:45:01.119]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:45:01.379 --> 01:45:02.679]  You can't survive without it.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:03.780]  But where do you get it?
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:09.842]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:45:10.063 --> 01:45:15.785]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:45:15.965 --> 01:45:32.846]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:45:33.226 --> 01:45:35.368]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:45:35.728 --> 01:45:36.909]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.950]  Easy assembly.
[01:45:38.230 --> 01:45:38.871]  Low maintenance.
[01:45:39.151 --> 01:45:40.972]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:46:02.691 --> 01:46:04.092]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[01:46:04.132 --> 01:46:05.574]  Victor, you're calling.
[01:46:05.654 --> 01:46:05.994]  Go ahead.
[01:46:06.114 --> 01:46:06.374]  Yes.
[01:46:06.835 --> 01:46:07.555]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:07.655 --> 01:46:13.861]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[01:46:14.061 --> 01:46:18.045]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[01:46:18.285 --> 01:46:19.726]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[01:46:20.106 --> 01:46:26.812]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[01:46:26.872 --> 01:46:29.735]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[01:46:30.616 --> 01:46:35.319]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[01:46:35.359 --> 01:46:43.185]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[01:46:43.205 --> 01:46:49.029]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[01:46:49.149 --> 01:46:54.473]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[01:46:54.553 --> 01:46:57.555]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:07.293]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:15.019 --> 01:47:21.304]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.985 --> 01:47:24.206]  I'm just an average man.
[01:47:24.406 --> 01:47:30.311]  I don't want to say we dodged a bullet from Trump talking about firing smart missiles at the Russians in Syria on Wednesday.
[01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:33.091]  They've got the doomsday planes in the air.
[01:47:33.511 --> 01:47:35.191]  Trump still says he may hit the targets.
[01:47:35.931 --> 01:47:41.773]  But you notice the Defense Secretary on Thursday said, we don't have evidence that the Syrians did this, that the Syrian government did this.
[01:47:42.974 --> 01:47:44.054]  Yeah, they don't have the motive.
[01:47:44.074 --> 01:47:44.594]  They're winning.
[01:47:44.915 --> 01:47:45.995]  The Russians are pulling out.
[01:47:47.035 --> 01:47:49.096]  The rebels have been caught doing it before.
[01:47:49.396 --> 01:48:00.900]  If I live on a block and somebody has stolen cars three times in the last year, and it's a known juvenile delinquent that's 14 years old, if another car gets stolen,
[01:48:03.288 --> 01:48:08.452]  Do you go to one of the owners of the cars and blame them, or do you go, wait, Billy's stolen three cars this year.
[01:48:09.573 --> 01:48:11.415]  Sure enough, you go find Billy, he's got the car.
[01:48:13.096 --> 01:48:14.537]  But, that doesn't even matter.
[01:48:14.617 --> 01:48:16.919]  You don't have proof, and it's rushed to war.
[01:48:16.999 --> 01:48:18.300]  We don't know who did it this time.
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:20.722]  It hasn't come out like the last three times it was the rebels.
[01:48:22.343 --> 01:48:24.945]  The problem is, the globalists will stage more false flanks.
[01:48:26.226 --> 01:48:27.868]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[01:48:29.039 --> 01:48:41.148]  That Trump, a week after he says, I want to pull out of Syria, six days later actually, I looked it up last night, six days after he says we're pulling out, two days later he goes, well the Pentagon doesn't want me to, but we're going to try.
[01:48:41.428 --> 01:48:41.788]  Boom!
[01:48:41.848 --> 01:48:42.549]  Terror attack!
[01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:43.530]  We got to stay.
[01:48:47.312 --> 01:48:47.873]  On civilians.
[01:48:47.913 --> 01:48:50.875]  The exact move the Syrians don't want is what they do.
[01:48:51.676 --> 01:48:53.057]  Riddle me that, Batman.
[01:48:55.278 --> 01:48:56.279]  So we're taking your phone calls.
[01:49:00.745 --> 01:49:03.346]  Pompeo's nomination is facing challenging Senate vote.
[01:49:03.486 --> 01:49:04.946]  That's on NewsWars.com right now.
[01:49:05.646 --> 01:49:09.407]  Pompeo's been drooling over, don't worry, we already killed a lot of Russians.
[01:49:10.387 --> 01:49:13.728]  Yeah, how dare them come in at our behest and work with us to take out ISIS.
[01:49:14.168 --> 01:49:15.028]  Now we want them out.
[01:49:15.108 --> 01:49:16.188]  This is all the Russia stuff.
[01:49:16.789 --> 01:49:17.609]  We've killed a lot of them.
[01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:22.490]  Yeah, they're out there at airfields working and stuff and loading the planes to bomb out ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:22.910]  We killed them.
[01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.530]  We killed them.
[01:49:23.650 --> 01:49:23.990]  We're good.
[01:49:24.010 --> 01:49:24.330]  We're good.
[01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:25.130]  We killed a lot of them.
[01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.910]  I'm not a Russian.
[01:49:26.071 --> 01:49:26.591]  I'm not a Russian.
[01:49:26.631 --> 01:49:26.931]  I promise.
[01:49:26.971 --> 01:49:27.651]  I killed a bunch of them.
[01:49:27.671 --> 01:49:28.091]  I'm really good.
[01:49:29.188 --> 01:49:30.621]  And I'll give you a nuclear war to prove I'm not bad.
[01:49:30.641 --> 01:49:31.025]  Okay?
[01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:35.770]  Jason in Florida, though, goes ahead of the line.
[01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:37.791]  By the way, we have a great computer system.
[01:49:37.811 --> 01:49:39.692]  We've got a new phone system, and it glitched out.
[01:49:39.712 --> 01:49:40.593]  I don't know.
[01:49:40.613 --> 01:49:41.793]  These are better than the old analog ones.
[01:49:41.813 --> 01:49:44.434]  We can take 100 calls at a time, but it just glitches and hangs up on people.
[01:49:44.675 --> 01:49:47.736]  So it just hung up on a bunch of people, so people are calling back in.
[01:49:47.756 --> 01:49:48.837]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:49:48.857 --> 01:49:50.838]  But Jason, he didn't glitch.
[01:49:50.878 --> 01:49:53.879]  Either it's Steven or Mark or Carol Humble, so we'll go to them.
[01:49:54.319 --> 01:49:57.261]  Jason in Florida disagrees with me.
[01:49:57.321 --> 01:49:58.041]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:49:58.561 --> 01:49:59.302]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:59.322 --> 01:50:00.002]  What up, Alex?
[01:50:00.771 --> 01:50:01.931]  I have two points.
[01:50:02.712 --> 01:50:05.852]  My last point will put a cherry on top, a bowtie on my first point.
[01:50:06.192 --> 01:50:07.313]  My first point is this, Alex.
[01:50:10.914 --> 01:50:12.854]  We are not in a war with the globalists.
[01:50:13.514 --> 01:50:18.856]  Because a war implies that both sides are engaged, at least both sides.
[01:50:19.636 --> 01:50:22.297]  We are not engaging the globalists.
[01:50:22.317 --> 01:50:24.077]  We are not engaged, we are not engaging.
[01:50:24.877 --> 01:50:27.018]  We are basically clueless
[01:50:28.323 --> 01:50:30.905]  And they are, we're under siege.
[01:50:31.966 --> 01:50:41.553]  And if the people of this country, especially the military, ever stood up to the globalists, it would be over very quickly.
[01:50:42.494 --> 01:50:57.645]  And that's where I feel like, and I'm going to preface this, big fan of yours, but I do believe that you are deliberately misleading people in saying that we can't fight the globalists physically.
[01:50:59.213 --> 01:51:16.984]  Um, and I think you probably have reasons for that, maybe legal reasons, but, um, we have to, because historically, and you know this, this is why I believe it's deliberate, you know historically there's never been a war that's been won, not physically.
[01:51:17.004 --> 01:51:20.526]  Alright, let me talk, let me, hold on, put him on hold.
[01:51:20.746 --> 01:51:22.587]  No, no, you just had a minute, I'm gonna talk now.
[01:51:23.467 --> 01:51:25.689]  I understand it makes everybody big man.
[01:51:27.645 --> 01:51:30.627]  To call in and then tell people I'm a bad person without evidence of it.
[01:51:32.208 --> 01:51:35.450]  I morally do what I think is best here on air.
[01:51:36.411 --> 01:51:39.212]  And if you know about the committees of correspondence, I'll go back to you in a minute, Jason.
[01:51:40.573 --> 01:51:51.721]  For a decade before the Revolutionary War in 1775, officially 1776, people had to redress some grievances, they educated people, they exposed what was going on, they tried to fix it peacefully.
[01:51:53.562 --> 01:51:53.862]  That's A.
[01:51:56.943 --> 01:52:08.029]  B, everybody that always calls in or comments on the website wanting violence saying I'm a wimp because I'm not calling, you know, for war and saying saddle up, let's put our helmets on and get our guns.
[01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:10.590]  What are they doing?
[01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:12.651]  They're always waiting on somebody else to lead it.
[01:52:12.991 --> 01:52:15.713]  And I'm not calling for you to be violent and call my bluffs.
[01:52:15.773 --> 01:52:16.453]  It's not a bluff, sir.
[01:52:17.774 --> 01:52:26.218]  The globalists stage false flags against themselves like Oklahoma City and others and provocateur others and let other events happen like what you saw.
[01:52:28.305 --> 01:52:30.688]  In Florida, they didn't stage it, but they knew it was coming.
[01:52:30.708 --> 01:52:33.132]  They stood down, yet again, in a blue city.
[01:52:35.796 --> 01:52:40.022]  So this idea that I'm not doing enough up here on air, I'm one of their main enemies.
[01:52:40.943 --> 01:52:41.804]  Trump has got in.
[01:52:41.844 --> 01:52:43.206]  He's restoring a lot of sovereignty.
[01:52:43.246 --> 01:52:44.188]  Pulled us out of the TPP.
[01:52:45.148 --> 01:52:46.089]  Did a lot of other stuff.
[01:52:46.110 --> 01:52:49.595]  They just hate him because he's actually being a president.
[01:52:50.296 --> 01:52:55.404]  Victor Orban is closing the borders, kicking the Islamists out, standing up against Soros and the globalists.
[01:52:55.765 --> 01:52:59.911]  Brazil, Spain, Iceland, the UK.
[01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:03.332]  People are waking up to global government.
[01:53:03.933 --> 01:53:11.717]  The globalists in their own publications, the Financial Times of London, Atlantic Monthly, Foreign Affairs of the CFR say, we're in crisis!
[01:53:12.038 --> 01:53:23.545]  We're under total attack by individuals highly motivated, waking up, who want self-determination, and nation-states are coming back, and people realize that productivity and free market's better, and that globalism has screwed them over, and is a vertical integration.
[01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:29.354]  And just five years ago, we admitted that we wanted a technocracy and authoritarianism, and they're pissed, and what are we going to do?
[01:53:29.394 --> 01:53:33.918]  The answer is, well, Communist China will come in and run Davos, the public Bilderberg, and we'll defeat them.
[01:53:34.759 --> 01:53:35.379]  We've taken giant...
[01:53:40.114 --> 01:53:44.256]  Multi-level, by orders of magnitude, leaps against them.
[01:53:44.916 --> 01:53:52.880]  Where now, there are at least ten national TV programs, five nights a week, four nights a week, one night a week, that openly attack me and lie about me.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:57.722]  Not just news programs, but Hollywood is obsessed, the comic books are everywhere attacking me.
[01:53:58.042 --> 01:53:58.382]  Why?
[01:53:58.482 --> 01:54:03.365]  Because we're here exposing that globalism is unelected, it's offshore, it's tax-exempt.
[01:54:04.165 --> 01:54:08.369]  It plays groups off against each other, it's amoral, and people are listening.
[01:54:08.389 --> 01:54:09.970]  We had Nigel Farage on yesterday.
[01:54:10.671 --> 01:54:13.273]  Nationalist parties are taking control of the EU Parliament.
[01:54:13.553 --> 01:54:14.414]  It's elected.
[01:54:14.754 --> 01:54:19.058]  The bureaucracy's not, so they've got them taking it over to expose it, to dismantle it.
[01:54:19.438 --> 01:54:20.359]  We're on the march.
[01:54:20.739 --> 01:54:22.020]  The empire's on the run.
[01:54:23.702 --> 01:54:26.804]  And there's this instant gratification thing.
[01:54:26.884 --> 01:54:31.108]  I mean, if you knew, and I'm not whining, but if you knew
[01:54:33.288 --> 01:54:40.175]  The stuff they've done to me behind the scenes, if you had any idea, it's made me stronger quite frankly.
[01:54:41.237 --> 01:54:47.183]  It's one thing to say you're fearless, it's another thing to actually go through it all and just be a completely stronger person on the other side.
[01:54:48.144 --> 01:54:51.187]  Committed, my will and spirit have never been stronger.
[01:54:52.469 --> 01:54:55.152]  So when I get mad at you, it's because you call in
[01:54:57.597 --> 01:55:12.671]  And just authoritatively say that I am holding back calling for violence when I've already had them try to take my children, lie about me, 17 lawsuits, death threat stuff.
[01:55:12.691 --> 01:55:16.355]  You couldn't imagine paying off people I knew for 14 years to tell lies about me.
[01:55:16.835 --> 01:55:20.739]  And I know that they've let me know the increases, the threat just goes up from there.
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:22.821]  That's just the warning.
[01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:32.134]  So, I've got a full globalist demonization campaign at the level they have when they launch a war against another country.
[01:55:32.454 --> 01:55:35.836]  They're launching propaganda against me, the European and U.S.
[01:55:35.896 --> 01:55:38.497]  press, like I'm a foreign government.
[01:55:40.458 --> 01:55:43.900]  I'm under the level of attack that governments before wars are under.
[01:55:44.201 --> 01:55:47.863]  Now, does anybody kind of think maybe we're covering something that's important?
[01:55:48.363 --> 01:55:50.044]  Maybe the system's scared of something?
[01:55:51.596 --> 01:56:01.361]  They're scared because the military and intelligence agencies listen, because they know I'm on target, know what I'm talking about, and we've already taken back much of the bureaucracy at the level where the rubber meets the road.
[01:56:01.601 --> 01:56:02.981]  You got a minute to finish up.
[01:56:03.462 --> 01:56:03.922]  Go ahead.
[01:56:04.302 --> 01:56:06.203]  Tell me how I can be a better person, Jason.
[01:56:07.484 --> 01:56:08.724]  Alex, I'm not saying you're bad.
[01:56:08.784 --> 01:56:10.225]  I have deep respect for you.
[01:56:10.245 --> 01:56:14.467]  I know you're a good person, and just by what you always say.
[01:56:15.627 --> 01:56:18.329]  Uh, it's the fruit of the tree that you can tell it on.
[01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:20.111]  But I want to make my final point is this.
[01:56:20.171 --> 01:56:21.933]  So there's no good fruit from Infowars?
[01:56:22.273 --> 01:56:23.053]  There's no good fruit?
[01:56:23.114 --> 01:56:23.514]  No, no.
[01:56:23.914 --> 01:56:24.515]  No, not at all.
[01:56:24.535 --> 01:56:25.896]  I'm saying the exact opposite.
[01:56:25.936 --> 01:56:27.057]  But here's my final point.
[01:56:28.058 --> 01:56:42.210]  I want to call right now on the United States military and the intelligence agencies to stand up, go rogue, take out the globalists, engage right now, and we'll end this and we'll have freedom and liberty 1776 worldwide.
[01:56:42.250 --> 01:56:42.650]  That's it.
[01:56:43.090 --> 01:56:43.351]  Done.
[01:56:43.591 --> 01:56:43.711]  Out.
[01:56:46.567 --> 01:56:47.467]  Well, I've said this.
[01:56:48.528 --> 01:56:52.049]  Deep state operators funded by Communist China, the Saudi Arabian money has been cut off.
[01:56:53.769 --> 01:56:58.090]  They're involved in covert operations, killing people, shooting people in the back.
[01:56:58.511 --> 01:57:00.351]  Seth Rich investigators, not just Seth Rich.
[01:57:01.791 --> 01:57:05.213]  So they are getting ready to go violent to try to push us into it.
[01:57:05.293 --> 01:57:09.274]  And you know, thugs always think they're going to win until their heads bounce up and down off the ground.
[01:57:10.314 --> 01:57:12.155]  So I'm not actually, here's the deal.
[01:57:12.235 --> 01:57:13.375]  I don't want to make that call.
[01:57:17.065 --> 01:57:18.326]  Because I'm not sure about it.
[01:57:19.286 --> 01:57:21.127]  But they are pushing us into a position.
[01:57:21.407 --> 01:57:29.912]  But don't worry, long before they've got their actuaries, long before they know our top's gonna blow, they're gonna blow up some federal buildings with daycare centers and blame it on us.
[01:57:29.932 --> 01:57:32.333]  So you're gonna probably get the war you want, son.
[01:57:32.973 --> 01:57:36.295]  So I hope you got your powder dry and you're all rigged up!
[01:57:37.076 --> 01:57:39.977]  Because me, shooting war, that's like, means nothing to me.
[01:57:39.997 --> 01:57:42.959]  That's like, that's like putting my boots on in the morning.
[01:57:42.999 --> 01:57:44.600]  That's like, I know how to do this.
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.320]  This is easy.
[01:57:49.045 --> 01:58:00.572]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[01:58:00.612 --> 01:58:01.573]  We're exposed to lead.
[01:58:01.613 --> 01:58:02.634]  We're exposed to mercury.
[01:58:02.674 --> 01:58:07.657]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[01:58:08.037 --> 01:58:13.060]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.282]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[01:58:16.082 --> 01:58:17.463]  Well, causes you to gain weight.
[01:58:17.584 --> 01:58:21.207]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[01:58:21.307 --> 01:58:26.291]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[01:58:26.671 --> 01:58:32.156]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[01:58:32.516 --> 01:58:37.741]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[01:58:38.101 --> 01:58:39.042]  And over and over again.
[01:58:39.102 --> 01:58:46.008]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[01:58:46.228 --> 01:58:48.430]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:50.071]  I mean, this is so massive.
[01:58:50.151 --> 01:59:03.462]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland.
[01:59:03.482 --> 01:59:04.123]  Fertility is key.
[01:59:04.663 --> 01:59:14.848]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually.
[01:59:14.888 --> 01:59:21.251]  The whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[01:59:21.631 --> 01:59:25.653]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[01:59:25.713 --> 01:59:29.235]  And you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill, and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying.
[01:59:29.715 --> 01:59:31.096]  All of a sudden, it was like, boom!
[01:59:31.576 --> 01:59:34.617]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:06.724 --> 02:00:09.566]  We now take you live from the front lines of the resistance.
[02:00:17.671 --> 02:00:22.834]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.175 --> 02:00:30.178]  Alright, we got Steve, Ryan, Mark, Catherine, Carlos, Jason, Caroline, and many others.
[02:00:32.779 --> 02:00:33.780]  Who should we go to first?
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:35.101]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:00:36.637 --> 02:00:43.102]  Let's go ahead and go to Mark, and we'll go to Catherine after the break.
[02:00:44.123 --> 02:00:44.784]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:46.205]  Thanks for holding from Pennsylvania.
[02:00:47.286 --> 02:00:48.006]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:48.066 --> 02:00:52.550]  Before I get to my point, yeah, y'all's video feed isn't going out on YouTube.
[02:00:52.890 --> 02:00:58.495]  The problem's on your end, because I can get other videos off of YouTube.
[02:00:58.575 --> 02:00:59.696]  I've tried different browsers.
[02:00:59.736 --> 02:01:05.841]  But anyway, I just wanted to say, call me as scum of the earth, a liar.
[02:01:07.568 --> 02:01:14.774]  Yeah, he lied to Congress about leaking stuff to the press.
[02:01:15.955 --> 02:01:19.218]  He didn't bother to tell President Trump that.
[02:01:20.058 --> 02:01:29.927]  The dossier was funded by the DNC, and oh, by the way, he didn't bother to withhold his signature in applying for the FISA warrant.
[02:01:30.007 --> 02:01:32.609]  I mean, I could go on and on, but yeah, this guy just...
[02:01:33.965 --> 02:01:38.873]  He has such a big wire, anything he says so full hold, he'd look like shit.
[02:01:38.893 --> 02:01:41.376]  Well he covered up Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:01:42.884 --> 02:01:46.706]  Jeff Epstein, he covered up the Lolita Express, the wiener stuff.
[02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:53.428]  I mean, serious Satanism, serious devil worship, serious stuff, the Democratic Party that's coming out in the news all the time.
[02:01:54.188 --> 02:01:58.310]  And so it's like, oh my gosh, he then says the dossier, well, we don't know if it's real.
[02:01:58.330 --> 02:01:59.050]  Well, they know it's fake.
[02:01:59.811 --> 02:02:01.391]  And then he says, oh yeah, it's so immoral.
[02:02:01.731 --> 02:02:02.812]  The president's so immoral.
[02:02:02.832 --> 02:02:06.673]  You know, if he was having sex with a woman 11 years ago.
[02:02:07.494 --> 02:02:10.795]  See, to them, it's immoral that he's not a pedophile.
[02:02:12.714 --> 02:02:19.420]  Yeah, the only thing that's immoral is standing up to those people.
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:22.383]  The only thing that's immoral is going against them.
[02:02:22.443 --> 02:02:27.107]  I mean, the left does have a moral code, but it's not a moral code as you or I would understand it.
[02:02:27.407 --> 02:02:35.735]  Their morality is... Dominating, lying, saying they're the moral authority, hen-pecking you, making you feel bad, running your life.
[02:02:35.775 --> 02:02:37.516]  Because they're weak, they're degenerate, they're scum.
[02:02:38.197 --> 02:02:40.158]  So they have to manipulate those of us that have morals.
[02:02:40.298 --> 02:02:48.961]  They don't have morals, so they seek to dominate the moral lexicon and language to then enslave those that do have morals and are productive.
[02:02:49.001 --> 02:02:50.382]  They can't build anything themselves.
[02:02:51.374 --> 02:02:57.456]  Yeah, but Comey of all people, I mean, that's like the pot calling the kettle black, Alex.
[02:02:57.476 --> 02:03:01.558]  Well, what are those dolls, the ventriloquist dolls that, you know, have the black hair and the eyes like his?
[02:03:02.799 --> 02:03:03.699]  What do they call those dolls?
[02:03:03.739 --> 02:03:13.343]  He looks like a seven foot tall version of one of those, and he's such a leaker, such a slimeball, such a liar, such a perjurer, such a dirtbag, such a criminal.
[02:03:14.143 --> 02:03:16.104]  And if the criminals running our government think
[02:03:16.944 --> 02:03:22.265]  At the bureaucratic level, think they're ever going to remove Trump and then themselves politically survive.
[02:03:22.285 --> 02:03:24.626]  They are just such arrogant filth.
[02:03:24.906 --> 02:03:25.926]  You're not invincible.
[02:03:26.266 --> 02:03:27.127]  Your time is over.
[02:03:27.167 --> 02:03:27.927]  God bless you, Mark.
[02:03:27.967 --> 02:03:28.747]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:29.027 --> 02:03:29.907]  Let me just add something.
[02:03:30.748 --> 02:03:35.949]  We send out three or four YouTube streams, three or four Facebook streams, a couple of Periscope feeds.
[02:03:36.429 --> 02:03:39.410]  Our main audience is AM and FM radio and then TV stations.
[02:03:40.090 --> 02:03:42.931]  Even though that's not the future, that's where the big audiences are.
[02:03:42.971 --> 02:03:44.091]  That's where we're at.
[02:03:45.222 --> 02:03:46.522]  And then we're big on the internet, obviously.
[02:03:46.542 --> 02:03:47.463]  They try to censor us there.
[02:03:47.983 --> 02:03:50.164]  And yeah, we got a lot of feeds and a lot of stuff going on.
[02:03:50.204 --> 02:03:58.466]  I want to mount a whole thing on the wall in there, where we can see all our internet feeds, so we can actually monitor that, you know, in amongst... A lot of our crew is amazing and stays so focused.
[02:03:59.087 --> 02:04:06.209]  Other folks all kind of work hard, or they check their phone, they kind of go talk to somebody, and it's kind of like a frat house or whatever, but we've got a great crew.
[02:04:07.017 --> 02:04:10.345]  But it's good when you call us and let us know, you know, that some of that stuff's happening.
[02:04:11.488 --> 02:04:13.513]  And so everybody can understand.
[02:04:13.533 --> 02:04:14.195]  Come on in here, dude.
[02:04:14.476 --> 02:04:15.197]  Is that YouTube picked up?
[02:04:19.167 --> 02:04:20.708]  Infowars.com for its live show.
[02:04:21.308 --> 02:04:22.769]  And we're going to have a pop-up soon.
[02:04:22.789 --> 02:04:28.853]  I don't know why we never did this, but we're going to have a pop-up that's real nice on the side that's got all the live shows, the feeds, all of it.
[02:04:29.033 --> 02:04:32.975]  But again, if you go and you see a YouTube feed that's down, go to Infowars.com.
[02:04:33.476 --> 02:04:36.738]  We have our own video feeds, we have our own audio feeds, we have our own podcast.
[02:04:37.038 --> 02:04:40.320]  We get so many calls and emails about the censorship on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:43.242]  People say, man, they're cutting your feed, they're blocking you, they're not letting me see it.
[02:04:44.182 --> 02:04:53.988]  We're just reaching you there in that controlled gulag, in that controlled little reservation, in that controlled plantation, beaming in saying, hey, you can come here, InfoWars.com.
[02:04:54.028 --> 02:04:56.690]  And our days are numbered, obviously, on all those platforms.
[02:04:56.710 --> 02:04:57.830]  So please, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:07.916]  Senator Rand Paul is warning that the Trump haters at the FBI still have their top-secret security clearance.
[02:05:08.136 --> 02:05:12.300]  The senator is demanding that exposed enemies of President Trump should be fired.
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:23.391]  Paul tweeted out a copy of a response he was sent in March to an earlier letter where he asked whether FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page still had security clearances.
[02:05:23.951 --> 02:05:32.115]  And the response from FBI Assistant Director Gregory Brower reads, all FBI employees must maintain a top-secret security clearance.
[02:05:32.675 --> 02:05:51.885]  On a Fox News appearance, Senator Paul warned that this potentially means that the exposed officials, who called Trump an idiot and a loathsome human, and talked about an FBI secret society and an insurance policy for if Trump was elected, can still access information regarding the investigation, posing a potential threat to national security.
[02:05:52.125 --> 02:05:57.687]  Paul said Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were exposed as enemies of President Trump and they need to be fired.
[02:05:58.007 --> 02:05:59.808]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[02:06:10.972 --> 02:06:14.854]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:06:19.671 --> 02:06:27.495]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is a paragon.
[02:06:28.315 --> 02:06:30.977]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:06:30.997 --> 02:06:31.097]  Scum!
[02:06:31.117 --> 02:06:31.817]  Russian scum!
[02:06:31.857 --> 02:06:35.959]  You know what always comes to mind?
[02:06:45.299 --> 02:06:46.740]  Your reputation is amazing.
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:48.581]  I will not let you down.
[02:06:48.661 --> 02:06:51.623]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:07:02.259 --> 02:07:03.379]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:07:03.399 --> 02:07:05.760]  We're going to take your calls with Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:07.341]  Always interesting, always informative.
[02:07:07.721 --> 02:07:14.463]  Formerly with the State Department, one of the guys that founded Delta Force with General Boykin and Schumacher, and of course worked with different agencies.
[02:07:14.483 --> 02:07:15.804]  He's going to ride shotgun with us.
[02:07:15.844 --> 02:07:17.624]  We'll start taking your calls again at the next segment.
[02:07:17.644 --> 02:07:18.285]  I love the angles.
[02:07:18.705 --> 02:07:21.326]  Steve in Pennsylvania wants to talk about Russia and the military-industrial complex.
[02:07:21.866 --> 02:07:26.047]  Ryan wants to talk about what we need as a cyber-nuke against World War III, whatever that means.
[02:07:26.828 --> 02:07:29.989]  Catherine, why didn't the FBI try to protect Trump from Russia blackmail?
[02:07:30.609 --> 02:07:31.810]  Well, because it's all made up.
[02:07:32.210 --> 02:07:36.854]  Carlos wants to talk about how to discover the areas of the swamp that need to be taken out.
[02:07:37.454 --> 02:07:44.220]  And also, Jason wants to talk about the only option Comey has is the lie, Caroline Comey continued defamation of the press.
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:47.282]  But Catherine and Caroline will be up first in the next segment.
[02:07:48.103 --> 02:07:48.923]  So much to cover.
[02:07:49.364 --> 02:07:50.284]  So much to happen.
[02:07:51.445 --> 02:07:52.366]  So much going on.
[02:07:52.546 --> 02:07:55.729]  But whenever I saw Trump on Wednesday with the tweet about
[02:07:56.693 --> 02:07:57.594]  Our missiles are coming.
[02:07:57.634 --> 02:07:58.334]  They're so good.
[02:07:58.374 --> 02:07:59.115]  They're so amazing.
[02:07:59.135 --> 02:07:59.955]  They're so high-tech.
[02:08:00.376 --> 02:08:04.118]  Horrible, you know, murdering animal Assad.
[02:08:04.459 --> 02:08:06.480]  The last three chemical attacks were false flags.
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:07.721]  Even our own Pentagon and U.N.
[02:08:07.761 --> 02:08:08.221]  admitted that.
[02:08:08.802 --> 02:08:18.168]  Now as the Russians are pulling out and Trump announces he wants to pull out in countervailance of what the deep state wants, within six days this happens and we're supposed to rush to it.
[02:08:18.228 --> 02:08:24.012]  But then Mattis yesterday came out and said, no, we don't have any evidence it was Assad.
[02:08:24.893 --> 02:08:34.200]  So, this shows the battle going on with the Deep State President John McCain, but because of his brain tumor, more and more the Deep State President is Mueller.
[02:08:35.121 --> 02:08:36.061]  He is their God.
[02:08:36.462 --> 02:08:42.386]  And then you've got the Vice Deep State President, Lyin' Leakin' Comey, perjuring Comey.
[02:08:42.966 --> 02:08:46.309]  So, talk about a wild, wild world of sports.
[02:08:46.809 --> 02:08:51.693]  Dr. Pachinik, where are we as a republic right now with all your great sources on what's going on?
[02:08:51.753 --> 02:08:53.054]  StevePachinik.com is the website.
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:00.802]  Overall, the deep state of the Republican
[02:09:14.417 --> 02:09:20.020]  It's fine because the Republic people are working, the unemployment is low, the economy is going up.
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:25.722]  Unfortunately, the stock market is what we call a lead in the newspaper market.
[02:09:25.802 --> 02:09:29.504]  In other words, it's reacting every time to the false news that's coming out.
[02:09:30.137 --> 02:09:38.124]  In terms of Comey, in terms of Mueller, those people will either be fired or they eventually become irrelevant.
[02:09:38.224 --> 02:09:48.653]  What is wonderful about what happened, including all of the people on your show and otherwise, is that Mattis and others came forth and said, look, this is a false flag.
[02:09:48.773 --> 02:09:54.418]  We've had British, American and French troops in Syria for quite a while.
[02:09:55.018 --> 02:09:58.601]  We did have an interchange between the Russians and the Americans.
[02:09:59.022 --> 02:09:59.823]  Some were hurt.
[02:10:00.383 --> 02:10:10.372]  The issue about Djibouti, where the planes were crashing, was really a cover-up for, unfortunately, brave warriors who died in Syria.
[02:10:10.652 --> 02:10:18.259]  We're not interested in going into war thanks to Mattis, who understands very well that war is not the solution for this.
[02:10:18.679 --> 02:10:19.439]  As does Trump.
[02:10:19.699 --> 02:10:32.785]  Trump is really just twittering all of the aspects in terms of the fact that he's threatening and putting a position in where he's putting Putin and he's putting the mullahs on notice.
[02:10:32.845 --> 02:10:34.986]  But is he in fact going to go into war?
[02:10:35.366 --> 02:10:36.026]  I think not.
[02:10:36.486 --> 02:10:48.659]  Ironically, with John Bolton there, who you would think would promote war, I think he has become somewhat more acquiescent to the demands of a greater general like Mattis.
[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:53.224]  Mattis knows exactly what generals have to do in order to go to war.
[02:10:53.444 --> 02:10:56.267]  They know very well that war is not the solution.
[02:10:56.787 --> 02:10:56.847]  Yes.
[02:11:12.086 --> 02:11:15.488]  Has no national security interest whatsoever in the Middle East.
[02:11:15.848 --> 02:11:19.991]  Thanks to Trump, we are now an exporter of oil.
[02:11:20.451 --> 02:11:25.414]  Anytime we have a strategic reserve depletion, we can fill it up in three or four days.
[02:11:25.434 --> 02:11:33.759]  Well, I want to go back to that, but since you mention it, Brennan has called Trump a kakaristocracy, which means a corrupt, inept government.
[02:11:34.079 --> 02:11:35.541]  But actually, look at all the real indicators.
[02:11:35.581 --> 02:11:37.082]  The country, everything's turning around.
[02:11:37.743 --> 02:11:38.184]  I agree.
[02:11:38.284 --> 02:11:44.170]  Trump, just like on DACA or just like on the guns, he says one thing to get the hawks off his back.
[02:11:44.531 --> 02:11:52.099]  I think Putin knew that was cartoonish on purpose, but then had no intention of actually striking Russian forces again that could lead us to World War III.
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:55.122]  But again, the boldness of the deep state
[02:11:56.204 --> 02:12:02.629]  Stay behind, telling Trump shut his mouth like Brennan did the first week Trump was in the White House.
[02:12:02.969 --> 02:12:04.271]  Couldn't believe Trump fired him.
[02:12:04.291 --> 02:12:06.573]  I mean, what is going on with Brennan and Clapper?
[02:12:06.613 --> 02:12:08.034]  They seem completely delusional.
[02:12:08.962 --> 02:12:10.203]  Well, they're not delusional.
[02:12:10.283 --> 02:12:13.805]  It's exactly what you and I talked about 13, 14 years ago.
[02:12:13.885 --> 02:12:15.446]  I have no respect for Brennan.
[02:12:15.506 --> 02:12:20.589]  Brennan is one of the most pathetic, incompetent, corrupt DCIs.
[02:12:20.689 --> 02:12:23.591]  He did not start as a DDO, a covert operative.
[02:12:23.951 --> 02:12:27.153]  Instead, he sucked his way up to the political system.
[02:12:27.173 --> 02:12:30.515]  He may have converted to Islam and was a disaster.
[02:12:30.936 --> 02:12:35.638]  The reason he could come up with the system of the CIA is that nobody stopped him.
[02:12:35.979 --> 02:12:36.379]  He was an
[02:12:36.659 --> 02:12:38.640]  Absolute disaster in Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:42.662]  He was a disaster under the Bush and Clinton administration.
[02:12:42.983 --> 02:12:44.984]  He should be put in prison.
[02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.965]  I've said it for a long time.
[02:12:47.005 --> 02:12:50.447]  Hayden is the same way and so is the other one.
[02:12:50.467 --> 02:12:51.167]  So let's explain it.
[02:12:51.187 --> 02:13:00.092]  They're a bunch of lip-wristed fraud sycophants that can't even tie their shoelaces and have never done anything for the country but have been put in there because they're political traitors.
[02:13:00.871 --> 02:13:02.952]  Correct, but they're not limp-wristed.
[02:13:03.012 --> 02:13:04.492]  These are real criminals.
[02:13:04.612 --> 02:13:11.674]  This is where you need to have an FBI director and an attorney general that is not Mueller, that is not Comey.
[02:13:11.694 --> 02:13:13.954]  So you're saying they have real criminal energy?
[02:13:14.734 --> 02:13:15.594]  This is criminal.
[02:13:15.755 --> 02:13:19.035]  There's no question that Brennan is a crime criminal.
[02:13:19.395 --> 02:13:20.796]  He initiated 9-11.
[02:13:21.576 --> 02:13:23.236]  He worked with Bush on 9-11.
[02:13:23.356 --> 02:13:26.057]  He worked with Cheney on 9-11.
[02:13:26.097 --> 02:13:27.937]  He worked with Worms on 9-11.
[02:13:28.297 --> 02:13:30.338]  There's no question this man's an idiot.
[02:13:31.059 --> 02:13:38.021]  I've known him, I've known all about him for years to come, and the CIA should have thrown him out a long time ago.
[02:13:38.061 --> 02:13:45.563]  And when you talk to those generals, when we had you on, you know, right after 9-11, back when you were on the Council on Foreign Relations, of course you co-wrote Clancy's books, folks that know who you are.
[02:13:45.583 --> 02:13:49.624]  I mean, the generals are all very open about the stand-down, all over the 28 pages.
[02:13:49.985 --> 02:13:52.445]  We knew about that 16, 17 years ago.
[02:13:52.505 --> 02:13:53.346]  We've been vindicated.
[02:13:53.766 --> 02:13:58.147]  And so I guess our military's been simmering under the surface, really upset about this for a while.
[02:13:59.096 --> 02:14:01.337]  Well, I know you don't like to hear what I'm about to say.
[02:14:01.417 --> 02:14:06.539]  Thanks to you and your audience, our military has been simmering since about 2002 and 2003.
[02:14:06.719 --> 02:14:24.006]  There have been incredible generals, including General Boykin, Keith Alexander, and a whole group of them, who began to understand that they were being coerced, or usurped, by these neocon cowards who are basically... Who are actually going to double-cross us with radical Islam in the final game, and it's incredible.
[02:14:24.944 --> 02:14:26.285]  It's exactly what happened.
[02:14:26.365 --> 02:14:32.408]  Saudi Arabia, Israel, now are involved in the same false flag that they were involved in 9-11.
[02:14:33.228 --> 02:14:43.673]  Instead of punishing Israel, getting rid of Bibi and bringing in a moderate, the Israeli people have done absolutely nothing but allowed their boys to die for nothing.
[02:14:43.753 --> 02:14:50.116]  Well, I want to be clear, and I know you're a part Jewish and your family died in the Holocaust and all of it, so you can specifically speak to this.
[02:14:50.156 --> 02:14:51.377]  I know you've got your history.
[02:14:52.116 --> 02:14:53.357]  The whole thing is clear though.
[02:14:53.457 --> 02:14:58.819]  Even the Russian ambassador to the EU, Russian ambassador to the UN, both said this is a false flag.
[02:14:59.299 --> 02:15:00.840]  Coalition forces in there trained them.
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:08.143]  But the Allah Akbar crowd that Saudi Arabia the first time gave the chemical mortars to, they want to be rock stars and get the millions of dollars for launching the attack.
[02:15:08.483 --> 02:15:10.424]  They videotaped it and Allah Akbar'd it.
[02:15:10.664 --> 02:15:13.446]  So the reason we know they staged it is they're so out of control.
[02:15:14.306 --> 02:15:16.568]  But Islamists don't even cover up they're doing it.
[02:15:16.768 --> 02:15:20.170]  So I'm not defending Israel, but I haven't been sure who was behind it.
[02:15:20.211 --> 02:15:23.273]  We just know it's a false flag because of motive and history and past action.
[02:15:23.693 --> 02:15:24.714]  I know you have great connections.
[02:15:25.154 --> 02:15:25.955]  We're going to go to break.
[02:15:25.975 --> 02:15:30.378]  When we come back, tell us who's telling you, Dr. Steve Pachinik, that it was Israel did this.
[02:15:31.784 --> 02:15:34.265]  Israel's been meeting with the new prince and his whole PR campaign.
[02:15:34.285 --> 02:15:39.408]  They've been very close with these secret meetings, and I know Saudi Arabia doesn't want... Israel that told me.
[02:15:39.648 --> 02:15:44.110]  Israel's behavior is so consistent, you can't avoid it.
[02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:45.130]  It was predictable.
[02:15:45.971 --> 02:15:46.291]  Well, sure.
[02:15:46.311 --> 02:15:49.713]  In fact, guys, print me that zero ahead, six reasons Trump they think may hit Syria.
[02:15:49.753 --> 02:15:52.514]  Because, I mean, it is true, Israel has an old beef with Syria.
[02:15:53.034 --> 02:15:54.795]  And so, yeah, this is something we have to look at.
[02:15:54.815 --> 02:15:56.276]  We'll be right back with your phone calls as well.
[02:16:02.879 --> 02:16:05.380]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:08.521]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[02:16:08.601 --> 02:16:11.442]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[02:16:11.482 --> 02:16:12.963]  What is the latest from the UK?
[02:16:13.083 --> 02:16:21.626]  Look, remember that in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[02:16:21.646 --> 02:16:25.847]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[02:16:25.867 --> 02:16:28.768]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS.
[02:16:28.848 --> 02:16:30.189]  It would have been mad!
[02:16:30.789 --> 02:16:38.495]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[02:16:38.515 --> 02:16:40.937]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[02:16:41.497 --> 02:16:43.238]  Trust Middle England.
[02:16:43.659 --> 02:16:45.120]  Trust Middle America.
[02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:48.903]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[02:16:49.243 --> 02:16:53.126]  Now, Mrs May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[02:16:53.686 --> 02:16:54.567]  All I can tell her
[02:16:55.327 --> 02:17:03.935]  is be careful because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago.
[02:17:03.955 --> 02:17:04.996]  Let's put it like this.
[02:17:05.556 --> 02:17:14.424]  If it wasn't Assad that did it, you know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago
[02:17:14.884 --> 02:17:20.225]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[02:17:20.685 --> 02:17:33.508]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[02:17:33.568 --> 02:17:35.728]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[02:17:35.848 --> 02:17:36.948]  You're a leading expert on this.
[02:17:37.028 --> 02:17:38.909]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[02:17:39.169 --> 02:17:40.089]  Why are they trying to flood?
[02:17:41.155 --> 02:17:42.296]  Because they hate Christianity.
[02:17:42.956 --> 02:17:53.921]  They deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[02:17:53.981 --> 02:17:54.801]  They deny that.
[02:17:55.221 --> 02:17:58.903]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[02:17:58.943 --> 02:18:00.163]  They want to get rid of it.
[02:18:00.644 --> 02:18:08.587]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[02:18:08.907 --> 02:18:10.648]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[02:18:11.377 --> 02:18:16.580]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:22.642]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[02:18:22.943 --> 02:18:31.226]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[02:18:31.266 --> 02:18:37.009]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[02:18:37.049 --> 02:18:38.210]  And look, what's really happening here?
[02:18:38.730 --> 02:18:40.531]  You know, don't underestimate
[02:18:41.131 --> 02:18:44.113]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[02:18:44.433 --> 02:18:45.494]  The victory of Brexit.
[02:18:45.774 --> 02:18:46.695]  The victory of Trump.
[02:18:47.315 --> 02:18:48.156]  You know, we're winning.
[02:18:48.516 --> 02:18:49.577]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[02:18:49.837 --> 02:18:57.441]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[02:18:57.521 --> 02:18:58.322]  And you know something?
[02:18:58.862 --> 02:18:59.663]  If we can resist,
[02:19:00.462 --> 02:19:09.588]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[02:19:09.628 --> 02:19:11.369]  So don't get down, everybody.
[02:19:11.649 --> 02:19:12.510]  Don't get depressed.
[02:19:12.850 --> 02:19:15.352]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[02:19:16.175 --> 02:19:25.084]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came in privately, cheered him up and cheered up the troops, and you were the critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[02:19:25.344 --> 02:19:26.005]  You're amazing.
[02:19:26.225 --> 02:19:26.926]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:19:26.986 --> 02:19:29.729]  I know you're very busy, but that's as the EU has said.
[02:19:29.769 --> 02:19:32.251]  They'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[02:19:32.291 --> 02:19:35.675]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[02:19:36.918 --> 02:19:49.571]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[02:19:49.931 --> 02:19:55.417]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we must retain it.
[02:19:55.897 --> 02:19:57.239]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[02:20:03.624 --> 02:20:08.286]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.153 --> 02:20:28.156]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:29.807 --> 02:20:31.029]  Alright, your phone calls are coming up.
[02:20:31.049 --> 02:20:31.930]  They're all on topic.
[02:20:31.950 --> 02:20:33.432]  Steve Pchenik's riding shotgun with us.
[02:20:35.735 --> 02:20:41.322]  Steve Pchenik, again, was the former head of psychological operations at the State Department and other positions.
[02:20:41.342 --> 02:20:42.023]  Really smart guy.
[02:20:42.043 --> 02:20:42.744]  He's been dead on.
[02:20:42.764 --> 02:20:43.545]  I've been interviewing him for...
[02:20:44.557 --> 02:20:47.158]  Gosh, it's got to be 17 years, 16, 17 years.
[02:20:47.178 --> 02:20:56.040]  So I read like a Council on Foreign Relations transcript, so he was telling them they were all idiots and that 9-11 was a pretext to start all these wars, it was going to blow up in their face.
[02:20:57.181 --> 02:21:02.542]  But now we sit here and we see radical Islam openly allied with the left and the globalists to flood Europe.
[02:21:02.562 --> 02:21:07.724]  I want to ask him what the plan is with that, but we got caught up by the break when he was getting to a very, very important point.
[02:21:08.164 --> 02:21:08.924]  Let's go back to that.
[02:21:11.514 --> 02:21:14.316]  Alex, basically what happens is very simple.
[02:21:14.536 --> 02:21:18.078]  I spent three weeks in Syria before the war broke out.
[02:21:18.239 --> 02:21:22.041]  I got to meet all the military people, the intelligence as well.
[02:21:22.602 --> 02:21:24.903]  They're not interested in a war with Israel.
[02:21:25.103 --> 02:21:26.064]  That's not their interest.
[02:21:26.104 --> 02:21:27.085]  And you've been there before.
[02:21:27.165 --> 02:21:29.086]  You were actually locked up by Assad's dad.
[02:21:29.929 --> 02:21:30.509]  That's correct.
[02:21:30.609 --> 02:21:31.710]  I had no protection.
[02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:34.611]  They took me around for 17, 18 days.
[02:21:34.651 --> 02:21:37.212]  Went to Latakia, Palmyra, Homs, Hamas.
[02:21:37.572 --> 02:21:41.213]  But I could see in Homs and Hamas that they were Sunni Muslim.
[02:21:41.314 --> 02:21:43.534]  You have a country that's ruled by Alawite.
[02:21:43.714 --> 02:21:45.655]  Alawite are minority Muslims.
[02:21:45.995 --> 02:21:47.836]  They're almost what we call light Muslims.
[02:21:47.976 --> 02:21:52.958]  And Bashar Assad, his father and his brothers... So aren't they really just sheep-dipped Christians?
[02:21:53.018 --> 02:21:54.859]  Like, they had to convert to Islam, but they're really not?
[02:21:56.024 --> 02:21:58.185]  Well, you know, I don't want to get into it.
[02:21:58.305 --> 02:22:02.047]  It's a form of Shiite Islam, but a very light form.
[02:22:02.408 --> 02:22:04.809]  And the French brought them in in the 1920s.
[02:22:04.869 --> 02:22:10.112]  They were located in the mountains, so they brought them to a beautiful area on the Mediterranean, Latakia.
[02:22:10.152 --> 02:22:13.574]  So Macron knows the history of this country very well.
[02:22:13.614 --> 02:22:14.494]  The French know it.
[02:22:14.794 --> 02:22:17.476]  They know that Assad does not want to go to war.
[02:22:17.936 --> 02:22:20.678]  The problem is... So aren't they basically like mystics?
[02:22:20.958 --> 02:22:22.459]  I mean, that particular group is more like mystics?
[02:22:22.679 --> 02:22:23.219]  No, that's...
[02:22:23.379 --> 02:22:26.010]  That would be a little bit more like the Sufi Muslim.
[02:22:26.051 --> 02:22:26.653]  Sufi, yeah.
[02:22:27.671 --> 02:22:32.374]  Those are the ones who are like, they will swirl around and they will kind of get lightheaded.
[02:22:32.414 --> 02:22:37.037]  And they're not ardent Muslims as much as they are metaphysicists.
[02:22:37.377 --> 02:22:41.020]  And Alawites are really very compassionate.
[02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:45.783]  Bashar takes care of the Jews, the Druze, the Christians, everyone else.
[02:22:46.463 --> 02:22:47.384]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:22:47.444 --> 02:22:49.806]  Nobody understands that he is an ophthalmologist.
[02:22:50.086 --> 02:22:51.647]  He really isn't looking for trouble.
[02:22:52.047 --> 02:22:56.310]  When he wanted to stay in power, and I warn the Council on Foreign Relations, particularly
[02:22:56.650 --> 02:23:04.411]  These immature, ignorant CIA operatives do not go into Syria.
[02:23:04.471 --> 02:23:11.353]  And of course it was Hillary Clinton, it was the entire Obama administration went in without knowing exactly.
[02:23:11.373 --> 02:23:14.733]  Their attempt to have an Arab Spring, bring it down and give it to the jihadis blew up in their face.
[02:23:15.093 --> 02:23:16.354]  Now the Russians are pulling out.
[02:23:16.514 --> 02:23:22.155]  Why in Hades would the Russians or Assad, when they're winning, stage a chemical attack on civilians?
[02:23:22.195 --> 02:23:23.175]  That's the dumbest thing ever.
[02:23:23.995 --> 02:23:25.075]  No, and that's the point.
[02:23:25.095 --> 02:23:27.616]  And also, I spent time in the Soviet Union.
[02:23:27.656 --> 02:23:28.856]  I did a regime change.
[02:23:28.876 --> 02:23:33.217]  But I also knew when Putin came in, the own KGB didn't know who Putin was.
[02:23:33.277 --> 02:23:34.218]  I explained it to them.
[02:23:34.278 --> 02:23:36.338]  He was an East German intelligence officer.
[02:23:36.678 --> 02:23:37.859]  He's very smart.
[02:23:37.979 --> 02:23:40.359]  He knows exactly how the agency works.
[02:23:40.739 --> 02:23:44.840]  He knows exactly the tactical and strategic elements of covert operation.
[02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:45.981]  He doesn't need this.
[02:23:46.081 --> 02:23:47.021]  They already had
[02:23:47.805 --> 02:23:53.168]  Basically taken out in exchange of some of our special forces who unfortunately were killed.
[02:23:53.688 --> 02:23:56.670]  And that was covered by the issue of Djibouti Airlines.
[02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:59.851]  Our airplanes were shot down in Djibouti.
[02:23:59.871 --> 02:24:00.712]  That's not correct.
[02:24:00.952 --> 02:24:03.213]  The soldiers who were killed were brave warriors.
[02:24:03.757 --> 02:24:20.702]  In the units in Syria, and then the person I think who was involved in the exchange would be Senator Duckworth, who was a brave heroine, still is, who lost her legs in the Iraq War, and I think she negotiated the release of our American Special Forces.
[02:24:21.122 --> 02:24:26.984]  In turn, the British were taken out, the Israeli pulled back, and the French have just stayed there.
[02:24:27.124 --> 02:24:31.405]  Usually... Sure, you're giving a whole history, but getting past that, we need to get the calls and a bunch of the big issues.
[02:24:32.822 --> 02:24:36.684]  The Deep State is full-on raiding Trump Tower over a woman 11 years ago.
[02:24:37.064 --> 02:24:38.144]  Complete mission creep.
[02:24:38.184 --> 02:24:38.904]  Totally illegal.
[02:24:38.964 --> 02:24:40.985]  All the lawyers, all the experts agree.
[02:24:41.285 --> 02:24:42.145]  They're cornered rats.
[02:24:42.165 --> 02:24:42.986]  They're totally rogue.
[02:24:43.026 --> 02:24:43.806]  This is dangerous.
[02:24:44.226 --> 02:24:52.329]  And I don't know how, under the Constitution, you name it, when the Communist Chinese and others are openly the only group funding the Democrats right now, from my information.
[02:24:52.589 --> 02:24:56.871]  Trump's cut off the Saudi funding, got them to, you know, at least partially reform.
[02:24:57.271 --> 02:24:58.591]  What is going on with Trump right now?
[02:24:58.611 --> 02:25:00.852]  I mean, how much of this can be put up with?
[02:25:01.897 --> 02:25:03.318]  Well, that's a good question.
[02:25:03.398 --> 02:25:11.764]  From my perspective, I think Trump is having a massive amount of input that he has to filter out very quickly.
[02:25:12.204 --> 02:25:15.626]  But there's one element about Trump that most people don't understand.
[02:25:16.046 --> 02:25:19.589]  The one thing Trump loves more than anything else is action.
[02:25:20.410 --> 02:25:32.906]  By the way, what you say from people I know about Trump, that's exactly it.
[02:25:33.306 --> 02:25:35.929]  He is super bored with just regular things.
[02:25:35.969 --> 02:25:37.611]  He likes super high-tension deals.
[02:25:38.365 --> 02:25:50.830]  He's a businessman, and what he's doing now, he loves the input that's coming in from China, Russia, from Syria, from his military officers, and what he's going to do is the same thing he did in the business world.
[02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:57.173]  He's going to give to those people whom he trusts, and particularly Mattis, you make the decision what we're going to do.
[02:25:57.553 --> 02:26:04.596]  In the meantime, I will Twitter, whatever it is, I will Twitter, and then the New York Times will call him imbecile, lazy, and stupid.
[02:26:04.816 --> 02:26:05.496]  It's the reverse!
[02:26:06.016 --> 02:26:16.044]  The man has basically said in the art of the deal, create uncertainty, create friction, create excitement, use the newspapers anytime you want.
[02:26:16.425 --> 02:26:21.349]  Because the left and the newspapers are lazy, they didn't even read the art of the deal.
[02:26:21.369 --> 02:26:30.896]  They didn't even read their enemy's own treatise, his whole worldview, because they're only one-dimensional about right now trying to score a point.
[02:26:31.176 --> 02:26:32.558]  They don't get how they're playing into it.
[02:26:32.858 --> 02:26:35.080]  Why is the modern left so stupid?
[02:26:35.987 --> 02:26:37.267]  Because they're arrogant.
[02:26:37.568 --> 02:26:40.468]  Arrogance leads to ignorance and self-destruction.
[02:26:40.589 --> 02:26:43.590]  I've seen this repeatedly, one after another.
[02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:45.010]  They don't learn the history.
[02:26:45.410 --> 02:26:50.812]  The one thing we Republicans have always done, we've concentrated on foreign policy, what our history is.
[02:26:51.232 --> 02:26:59.017]  What it wasn't, even the people at the University of Chicago, who were conservatives, knew that December 7th was a false flag.
[02:26:59.617 --> 02:27:00.578]  Well, they let it happen.
[02:27:00.598 --> 02:27:01.279]  Yeah, but let me ask you this.
[02:27:01.299 --> 02:27:02.219]  We gotta go to break, go to calls.
[02:27:02.259 --> 02:27:04.601]  I promise I'm gonna go right to Catherine and Caroline.
[02:27:04.621 --> 02:27:05.381]  We come back, I promise.
[02:27:05.841 --> 02:27:09.344]  Briefly, I'm not whining, but you talked to your sources when they had us kicked off YouTube.
[02:27:09.864 --> 02:27:13.227]  He said it's a coup d'etat inside there, it's a mutiny, it's gonna be cleaned up in a few days.
[02:27:13.608 --> 02:27:16.370]  Geospatial Center runs the NSA, which everybody knows.
[02:27:16.390 --> 02:27:20.534]  I tell reporters that they think I'm crazy, that's just a fact, it's in mainstream news.
[02:27:21.155 --> 02:27:26.981]  And sure enough, it's taken them a month, they've turned everybody's channel back on, they had to go through it all, it's happened.
[02:27:27.441 --> 02:27:32.143]  So what's happening now with like this 15 lawsuits I'm under, which my lawyers admit are all fake.
[02:27:32.403 --> 02:27:34.664]  We're getting them overturned every week, but they just file more.
[02:27:35.024 --> 02:27:37.505]  They've got big ones I'm going to break that are going to be filed next week.
[02:27:37.805 --> 02:27:38.926]  I'll break it before they break them.
[02:27:38.946 --> 02:27:39.846]  I want people to know about this.
[02:27:40.527 --> 02:27:41.367]  What is this tactic?
[02:27:42.113 --> 02:27:43.854]  Basically, they're harassing you.
[02:27:43.894 --> 02:27:46.694]  There's no way they can come in on you legitimately.
[02:27:46.755 --> 02:27:49.375]  Your lawyers will tell you there's no cause of action.
[02:27:49.916 --> 02:27:53.777]  The basic problem was that they wanted to take you down and they tried it.
[02:27:54.137 --> 02:27:54.917]  Then what happened?
[02:27:54.957 --> 02:27:56.978]  Zuckerberg got called into Congress.
[02:27:57.278 --> 02:27:58.018]  Then what happened?
[02:27:58.058 --> 02:28:00.479]  YouTube was told to cease and desist.
[02:28:00.999 --> 02:28:01.880]  So was Google.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.021]  And suddenly I got monetized.
[02:28:04.081 --> 02:28:04.742]  So will you.
[02:28:04.802 --> 02:28:07.724]  And I said to you, you will remain on the air.
[02:28:08.124 --> 02:28:10.365]  Whatever else they want to do, that's harassment.
[02:28:10.465 --> 02:28:13.107]  From my point of view, you're going to remain on.
[02:28:13.167 --> 02:28:21.773]  I just want you to take it easy because this is part of the game that occurs when the left and the attackers have no more options.
[02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:25.115]  They're basically scattering all over the field.
[02:28:25.375 --> 02:28:26.116]  They have nothing else.
[02:28:26.136 --> 02:28:27.337]  You're talking about death throes.
[02:28:27.377 --> 02:28:28.538]  And we're not just saying that.
[02:28:28.578 --> 02:28:30.679]  These are flailing death throes.
[02:28:31.379 --> 02:28:31.980]  That's correct.
[02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:41.404]  You're seeing the entity die, and they're trying to resuscitate through the midterms and bringing in other, you know, Democrats.
[02:28:41.464 --> 02:28:46.607]  But basically the Ryans and others who should never have been there in the first place really are leaving.
[02:28:46.647 --> 02:28:47.507]  That's another question.
[02:28:47.567 --> 02:28:50.048]  Why is Ryan evacuating from your Intel with Dr. Seif Shinnick?
[02:28:50.088 --> 02:28:51.989]  And then, I got a new phone system.
[02:28:52.029 --> 02:28:52.569]  It's crashing.
[02:28:52.649 --> 02:28:53.990]  It's intermittent internet service.
[02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:55.231]  I'm calling an outside group in.
[02:28:55.631 --> 02:28:57.552]  I'm gonna go pull those old switches out of the wall myself.
[02:28:58.885 --> 02:29:01.548]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[02:29:01.948 --> 02:29:07.094]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[02:29:07.774 --> 02:29:10.697]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[02:29:11.138 --> 02:29:14.661]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[02:29:15.262 --> 02:29:26.549]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[02:29:27.169 --> 02:29:37.915]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[02:29:38.236 --> 02:29:43.639]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[02:29:43.979 --> 02:29:47.240]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books.
[02:29:47.781 --> 02:29:49.221]  It's a 360 win.
[02:29:49.601 --> 02:29:54.883]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle, you're helping the fight for freedom.
[02:29:55.183 --> 02:29:56.524]  So please go to the site now.
[02:29:56.964 --> 02:29:58.545]  We need your support.
[02:29:59.659 --> 02:30:00.400]  I'm so excited.
[02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:10.026]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:30:10.626 --> 02:30:15.790]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:18.932]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:30:19.132 --> 02:30:27.898]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:30:30.019 --> 02:30:49.109]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:30:49.610 --> 02:30:50.890]  It is amazing!
[02:30:52.291 --> 02:30:57.254]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:30:59.184 --> 02:31:01.025]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:31:01.065 --> 02:31:01.425]  Go ahead.
[02:31:02.305 --> 02:31:04.206]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:31:04.246 --> 02:31:14.571]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:31:14.751 --> 02:31:18.113]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:31:18.553 --> 02:31:18.833]  Absolutely.
[02:31:41.327 --> 02:31:54.234]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:31:59.804 --> 02:32:03.867]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:33:03.044 --> 02:33:05.685]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.145 --> 02:33:28.228]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:29.048 --> 02:33:30.509]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.529 --> 02:33:32.891]  Alright, and again we got a new phone system.
[02:33:32.911 --> 02:33:35.032]  They're just tweaking it so it's been up and down today.
[02:33:35.052 --> 02:33:36.053]  Crew's doing a great job.
[02:33:36.193 --> 02:33:37.394]  Actually, it's all new switches.
[02:33:37.414 --> 02:33:38.715]  I wonder if some of these old switches gone.
[02:33:38.735 --> 02:33:39.816]  Actually, I went in the control room.
[02:33:39.956 --> 02:33:41.297]  It's all new phone system in it.
[02:33:41.957 --> 02:33:42.677]  It's having problems.
[02:33:42.717 --> 02:33:45.119]  I thought somebody might have jacked into it or hacked it.
[02:33:45.139 --> 02:33:45.959]  That goes on around here.
[02:33:45.979 --> 02:33:50.061]  But it was actually one of the... Joel Gilbert coming up uses it for his audio connection.
[02:33:50.101 --> 02:33:51.182]  So it's a backup.
[02:33:51.202 --> 02:33:52.122]  So he was logging in.
[02:33:52.382 --> 02:33:54.904]  So they saw that on the computer while the system was going down.
[02:33:54.924 --> 02:33:57.245]  And so we had to change the password to a bunch of other stuff.
[02:33:57.265 --> 02:33:58.586]  So that's going on here.
[02:33:58.606 --> 02:33:59.946]  But if you can call back in, we'll go to you.
[02:33:59.966 --> 02:34:00.607]  I apologize.
[02:34:00.627 --> 02:34:01.167]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:34:01.187 --> 02:34:01.227]  877-789-2539.
[02:34:05.785 --> 02:34:08.066]  Obviously, getting ready to go to your calls twice had the phone system go down.
[02:34:08.086 --> 02:34:10.266]  It usually goes down like twice every, you know, six months.
[02:34:10.286 --> 02:34:11.647]  It can be four times a year.
[02:34:11.687 --> 02:34:12.387]  It's going down a lot.
[02:34:12.407 --> 02:34:13.027]  We're going to fix it.
[02:34:14.227 --> 02:34:20.109]  Now, the crew was like, this is great radio, really informative, but you didn't get back to Israel last segment.
[02:34:20.129 --> 02:34:21.490]  Get back to Israel on the false flag.
[02:34:23.010 --> 02:34:25.851]  And so Pchenik was going to get more into that, but just briefly getting into me.
[02:34:27.014 --> 02:34:34.477]  And getting into Infowars, because yeah, we reach 30-40 million people a week during big peak times, 50-60 million, sometimes more than that.
[02:34:34.557 --> 02:34:38.838]  They saw right before the election, in the election, Paul Watson was the real star.
[02:34:38.898 --> 02:34:41.579]  He had videos every week with over 20 million views apiece.
[02:34:42.339 --> 02:34:47.981]  I mean, there were some videos with 37 million views, and then that was in one week, and they would be at 200 million now.
[02:34:48.341 --> 02:34:50.262]  Once you hit above 20 million, they just keep climbing.
[02:34:51.201 --> 02:34:52.962]  And Facebook and YouTube just deleted them all.
[02:34:53.322 --> 02:34:54.142]  They don't even give us notice.
[02:34:54.162 --> 02:34:55.382]  They just go in and bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
[02:34:55.662 --> 02:34:56.583]  All these videos are gone.
[02:34:57.223 --> 02:35:00.724]  And so now we're shadow-banned down to if you're only on the Facebook or YouTube.
[02:35:01.024 --> 02:35:02.165]  If you're on the page, you can see it.
[02:35:02.185 --> 02:35:05.686]  And it's still millions of people a day, and we're on hundreds of radio stations and TV.
[02:35:05.946 --> 02:35:08.226]  So we're still reaching a lot of people, but they've strangled it a bit.
[02:35:08.647 --> 02:35:09.487]  But it seeps out.
[02:35:09.547 --> 02:35:10.527]  It's the Streisand effect.
[02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:12.488]  But we're not that good.
[02:35:13.288 --> 02:35:17.029]  I mean, maybe they see us as a weak target, so they think it's a good poster child.
[02:35:17.289 --> 02:35:21.710]  They thought that with Trump, like, use Alex Jones, his connection to Trump, to make Trump look bad.
[02:35:22.271 --> 02:35:25.111]  But I talked to the campaign and others, that ended up giving him a mystique.
[02:35:25.612 --> 02:35:27.112]  People want anti-establishment.
[02:35:27.152 --> 02:35:30.673]  So, we're talking ten different TV shows a week attacking me.
[02:35:30.713 --> 02:35:37.635]  I mean, shows all about the show, Comedy Central shows where they steal our identity, say they're with us, and then say horrible things in our name.
[02:35:39.276 --> 02:35:40.156]  Super Deception.
[02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:49.125]  You know, the show Homeland, all this stuff, it goes on and on, and it's a total obsession by these idiots, and they don't even get...
[02:35:50.728 --> 02:35:59.054]  There are now hundreds of channels I know of, that I can't even keep track of, that are suddenly getting 3, 4, 5 million views, all basically saying the same thing we're saying.
[02:35:59.114 --> 02:36:13.365]  So, all this attention to censorship, to me, just eyeballing it, looks like it blew up in their face worse, and even in their fake polls, Trump's even up more, and nationalists are winning everywhere, and populism's coming back, and the EU admits it's about to collapse.
[02:36:14.386 --> 02:36:15.307]  What's happened here?
[02:36:15.627 --> 02:36:17.249]  And why are they so obsessed with InfoWars?
[02:36:17.489 --> 02:36:19.110]  Is it because you come on or others come on?
[02:36:19.290 --> 02:36:21.572]  Because to me, I don't think it's that big a deal.
[02:36:22.913 --> 02:36:24.475]  Well, you are a big deal.
[02:36:24.495 --> 02:36:25.616]  The issue isn't that.
[02:36:25.716 --> 02:36:28.438]  You didn't start out with your grandiosity.
[02:36:28.478 --> 02:36:30.500]  You started out with a notion that, look,
[02:36:31.172 --> 02:36:37.057]  I'm going to say whatever I'm going to say, and I'm going to say it my way, not the New York Times way, not the New York Post.
[02:36:37.537 --> 02:36:39.299]  My way is Alex Jones way.
[02:36:39.459 --> 02:36:44.523]  The two combination of a paradigm shift, you've got to understand what it is that we're doing.
[02:36:44.923 --> 02:36:54.731]  We have literally broken the narrative of the newspaper, the narrative of the three articles on the one subject.
[02:36:54.771 --> 02:36:55.752]  They don't know what to say.
[02:36:56.312 --> 02:37:00.399]  And you basically came in and said, look, I don't believe any of this.
[02:37:00.519 --> 02:37:01.941]  This is how I'm going to work it.
[02:37:02.402 --> 02:37:03.824]  I'm going to be spontaneous.
[02:37:04.025 --> 02:37:10.275]  I'm going to start riffing in my own mind, whatever words come to mind, and also be amusing about it.
[02:37:10.885 --> 02:37:13.466]  That was not conceivable.
[02:37:13.926 --> 02:37:15.807]  No one in the press could understand.
[02:37:15.827 --> 02:37:24.910]  And by the way, even Colbert two weeks ago kind of slipped up and he goes with his guest, he goes, Infowars is so bad because it's creating new narratives and they both look scared.
[02:37:25.310 --> 02:37:26.290]  What are they scared of?
[02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:27.691]  These people are, you know what it is?
[02:37:27.971 --> 02:37:29.271]  They don't get to be their own men.
[02:37:29.611 --> 02:37:30.672]  They're told what to say.
[02:37:31.505 --> 02:37:38.711]  Remember, when you're not your own man and you have your own business, this is why you attract and I attract entrepreneurs.
[02:37:38.771 --> 02:37:40.272]  We're not beholden to anybody.
[02:37:40.572 --> 02:37:42.233]  We're just beholden to ourselves.
[02:37:42.553 --> 02:37:43.714]  We make the mistakes.
[02:37:43.794 --> 02:37:44.395]  We fail.
[02:37:44.495 --> 02:37:49.899]  When you get a guy who's Colbert, comes out of the Stewart Show or whatever, he's not really that funny.
[02:37:49.979 --> 02:37:50.960]  He thinks he's funny.
[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:53.781]  And basically, he doesn't know what to say.
[02:37:53.821 --> 02:37:58.002]  He's paid $6 million to stand up there like a puppet to say what?
[02:37:58.282 --> 02:37:59.382]  Nobody's interested.
[02:37:59.862 --> 02:38:04.183]  Instead, we had a paradigm shift where the guy named Alex Jones from where?
[02:38:04.703 --> 02:38:05.623]  Austin, Texas?
[02:38:05.663 --> 02:38:07.284]  Well, Austin isn't New York.
[02:38:07.684 --> 02:38:09.164]  Austin isn't Los Angeles.
[02:38:09.564 --> 02:38:10.824]  Austin isn't Chicago.
[02:38:10.904 --> 02:38:12.945]  What in God's name is in Austin, Texas?
[02:38:13.345 --> 02:38:18.729]  So we have a different person, a different personality, a different format, a different location.
[02:38:18.809 --> 02:38:20.871]  Then you get a guy, his name is what?
[02:38:20.931 --> 02:38:21.892]  Dr. Steve who?
[02:38:22.232 --> 02:38:22.812]  Pijanek?
[02:38:23.213 --> 02:38:23.693]  He what?
[02:38:23.713 --> 02:38:30.278]  He left the Council on Foreign Relations because he was against the war in Syria and Iran and Iraq.
[02:38:30.558 --> 02:38:31.419]  I never heard of that.
[02:38:31.619 --> 02:38:34.161]  He was an anointed person and then he left.
[02:38:34.281 --> 02:38:35.402]  And he's joining who?
[02:38:35.922 --> 02:38:36.663]  Alex Jones.
[02:38:36.723 --> 02:38:37.584]  And he's saying what?
[02:38:38.424 --> 02:38:44.829]  All of those elements combined created a combustion that basically the system can't contain.
[02:38:44.969 --> 02:38:47.932]  They don't understand it, and to this day they still don't understand it.
[02:38:47.952 --> 02:38:57.920]  And they don't get that what you and I and many others did, we already detonated, and now the shockwaves are going out, we already sunk to the bottom, even if they take us out, we already blew their operation.
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:38:58.800]  They don't get it.
[02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:02.103]  They think they can go back and attack the source of the detonation.
[02:39:03.589 --> 02:39:07.932]  They can't get it because, as you said, we've already been decapitated.
[02:39:07.992 --> 02:39:08.752]  We've come back.
[02:39:09.092 --> 02:39:12.514]  We said to them, if you pull this stuff again, we'll decapitate you.
[02:39:12.594 --> 02:39:13.654]  And by the way, they did.
[02:39:14.035 --> 02:39:16.656]  I'm sorry the lady had to kill people at YouTube.
[02:39:16.956 --> 02:39:22.379]  But basically, that was the expression of frustration that was coming out against Google and YouTube.
[02:39:22.839 --> 02:39:33.906]  And when I warned the Soviet Jewish boy who I took out of the Soviet Union, Bray, and he started to create his own gulag on YouTube and Google, that was a warning to him.
[02:39:34.066 --> 02:39:36.088]  And ironically... By the way, you're not just saying that.
[02:39:36.128 --> 02:39:41.711]  You said days before Bloomberg broke that there was a mutiny inside YouTube and Google and they were going to fix it, everything.
[02:39:41.751 --> 02:39:44.433]  You said that you knew that from the Geospatial Center.
[02:39:44.553 --> 02:39:46.875]  Tell us as much specifics as you can because that's big.
[02:39:47.881 --> 02:39:51.902]  Well, I don't want to get into the National Geospatial Agency.
[02:39:52.002 --> 02:39:54.964]  All I can tell you is it's one of our newest intelligence outfits.
[02:39:55.124 --> 02:39:59.265]  It's a brilliant collection of individuals from all over the world.
[02:39:59.385 --> 02:40:03.767]  These are the guys who, and women by the way, it was headed by a woman.
[02:40:03.887 --> 02:40:09.289]  Sure, but you said they're being told right now they're not going to turn Google into a gulag.
[02:40:10.849 --> 02:40:17.952]  Yeah, and the reason for that is there was a gentleman by the name of Keith Alexander, General Keith Alexander, whom I worked with.
[02:40:18.272 --> 02:40:21.053]  Well, he was in G2, but he was head of the NSA.
[02:40:21.493 --> 02:40:32.718]  Now he has his own private consulting, but he asked the question that the National Geospatial Agency really had to answer in an entity, and that was, what is the third dimension of the Internet?
[02:40:33.058 --> 02:40:39.941]  We know the ones, the zeros, but what is life within the Internet in its depth and horizontal levels?
[02:40:40.321 --> 02:40:40.841]  It's deep.
[02:40:41.082 --> 02:40:42.182]  How deep does it go?
[02:40:42.242 --> 02:40:43.382]  How far does it go?
[02:40:43.523 --> 02:40:47.504]  And a whole institution was created to answer that third question.
[02:40:47.524 --> 02:40:55.268]  Well, it's an interface into human activity in the future, and so it's actually a nexus into the third dimension and above that.
[02:40:55.948 --> 02:40:58.169]  It's a giant brain-melting machine.
[02:40:59.033 --> 02:40:59.894]  Now you got it.
[02:41:00.114 --> 02:41:06.740]  Now we not only have the internet, but we have AI, artificial intelligence working on AI, artificial intelligence.
[02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:16.489]  We have quantum encryption, which is a new concept, but I kept saying it for months here and elsewhere, that basically we no longer just
[02:41:18.050 --> 02:41:38.550]  I was about to say, how come the Democrats and these old thinkers with one-dimensional thinking, where they do A, not thinking about how it moves, know that other people like Trump and others now with their own instinct, but also with computers, can actually look forward 20 moves?
[02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:40.772]  In fact, it makes me feel pathetic.
[02:41:41.152 --> 02:41:44.183]  That the globalists were in power this long when they're that pathetic.
[02:41:44.303 --> 02:41:46.651]  Why were we that weak to let them do this?
[02:41:47.535 --> 02:41:48.516]  We weren't that weak.
[02:41:48.556 --> 02:41:51.939]  We basically had to respect the geriatric unit.
[02:41:51.959 --> 02:41:53.260]  You have Dianne Feinstein, 84.
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:54.681]  You have Soros, 87.
[02:41:54.981 --> 02:41:57.643]  You have Pelosi, 79.
[02:41:58.024 --> 02:42:01.427]  You have McCain, who's an idiot and a war criminal.
[02:42:01.487 --> 02:42:02.828]  I mean, this is what happened.
[02:42:02.888 --> 02:42:06.411]  It had to be cleaned out by the people of the United States.
[02:42:06.591 --> 02:42:08.052]  You and I could target them.
[02:42:08.452 --> 02:42:11.535]  You and I could go after them verbally and then eventually
[02:42:11.955 --> 02:42:14.438]  They were spotted, but it's like anything else.
[02:42:14.798 --> 02:42:19.462]  A revolution takes place, but it's occurring much faster than you would have imagined.
[02:42:19.783 --> 02:42:24.207]  When we first started 17 years ago, you and I didn't know we would be on.
[02:42:24.567 --> 02:42:27.030]  Quite frankly, there were people who threatened me.
[02:42:27.450 --> 02:42:32.192]  The FBI gave me subpoenas where I had to show up before a prosecutor.
[02:42:32.572 --> 02:42:35.253]  You, in turn, you had to show up at court.
[02:42:35.413 --> 02:42:38.314]  So it was an endless series of fights that we had to live.
[02:42:38.654 --> 02:42:44.176]  They're basically a geriatric unit with very little memory and very little thinking capacity.
[02:42:44.476 --> 02:42:44.936]  That's right.
[02:42:44.996 --> 02:42:47.877]  And they think they're going to whack us on the head and we're going to go away.
[02:42:47.978 --> 02:42:48.818]  It's the other way around.
[02:42:49.578 --> 02:42:50.519]  It's the other way around.
[02:42:50.559 --> 02:42:54.362]  The more they hit us, the better it is because it makes us more important.
[02:42:54.542 --> 02:42:56.564]  They created their own monster.
[02:42:56.624 --> 02:42:57.064]  Welcome.
[02:42:57.345 --> 02:42:57.645]  That's right.
[02:42:57.665 --> 02:42:58.486]  We'll be back with your call.
[02:42:58.506 --> 02:42:58.826]  Stay with us.
[02:42:59.426 --> 02:43:02.209]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[02:43:02.849 --> 02:43:06.412]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:43:06.812 --> 02:43:09.775]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:43:10.155 --> 02:43:12.117]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:43:12.677 --> 02:43:17.080]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:43:17.421 --> 02:43:19.482]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:43:19.762 --> 02:43:26.207]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:43:26.787 --> 02:43:33.932]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:43:34.953 --> 02:43:39.614]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:43:40.014 --> 02:43:47.016]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[02:43:47.656 --> 02:43:52.117]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWars Life.
[02:43:52.577 --> 02:43:55.497]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:43:59.392 --> 02:44:03.858]  Alpha Power Vital Male Androgen Biosynthesis Promoter.
[02:44:03.978 --> 02:44:11.909]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[02:44:12.350 --> 02:44:13.972]  But, here's what you want to know.
[02:44:14.940 --> 02:44:20.902]  You want to go to mfullmorestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:44:21.562 --> 02:44:25.104]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:44:25.984 --> 02:44:33.987]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:44:34.567 --> 02:44:42.230]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:46.815]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[02:44:47.355 --> 02:44:48.176]  It's Alpha Power.
[02:44:48.216 --> 02:44:51.320]  And quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[02:44:52.416 --> 02:45:07.288]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[02:45:07.688 --> 02:45:13.072]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[02:45:13.373 --> 02:45:14.894]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[02:45:15.214 --> 02:45:16.035]  Oh man, it's really great.
[02:45:16.075 --> 02:45:16.535]  It really works.
[02:45:16.555 --> 02:45:18.757]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with all the power.
[02:45:18.937 --> 02:45:21.139]  Because I said, I want to dominate the industry.
[02:45:21.699 --> 02:45:26.003]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[02:45:26.023 --> 02:45:27.344]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[02:45:28.185 --> 02:45:35.410]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[02:45:35.430 --> 02:45:36.852]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[02:45:37.372 --> 02:45:39.033]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[02:45:39.053 --> 02:45:40.394]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[02:45:40.455 --> 02:45:41.876]  You've got marketing other costs that go in.
[02:45:44.778 --> 02:45:45.619]  But here's an example.
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:53.488]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:45:54.048 --> 02:45:55.770]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:45:56.231 --> 02:46:02.417]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[02:46:03.078 --> 02:46:08.180]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:46:08.461 --> 02:46:16.804]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product, in them.
[02:46:17.205 --> 02:46:18.225]  Nobody else does that.
[02:46:18.305 --> 02:46:21.026]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:46:21.507 --> 02:46:31.251]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in
[02:46:31.271 --> 02:46:37.674]  Again, quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[02:46:38.054 --> 02:46:46.998]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globulus, a 360 win.
[02:46:47.378 --> 02:46:49.379]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:46:49.779 --> 02:46:55.041]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:46:55.061 --> 02:46:55.481]  A total 360 win.
[02:47:02.998 --> 02:47:05.701]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.016 --> 02:47:24.102]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:27.380]  I want to be clear.
[02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:31.183]  The reason I brought this up for Dr. Steve Pchenik is I know he has some of the best sources out there.
[02:47:31.203 --> 02:47:34.004]  He's been so accurate over the 17 years I've been talking to him.
[02:47:34.365 --> 02:47:36.066]  Hard to believe it's been that long since 2002.
[02:47:36.106 --> 02:47:42.750]  It was early 2002 I first started interviewing him and he was saying Bin Laden was dead.
[02:47:42.770 --> 02:47:44.071]  Now they bring him out on ice later.
[02:47:44.091 --> 02:47:49.835]  Then I've talked to Navy SEALs and people that weren't blown up from DEVGROUP and they just say that they're not going to talk.
[02:47:49.855 --> 02:47:51.236]  But yeah, it's all fake.
[02:47:54.451 --> 02:47:57.232]  Well, just to say stuff like that on there, it's really dangerous.
[02:47:57.252 --> 02:47:57.773]  Some people know.
[02:47:57.793 --> 02:48:02.055]  I mean, it's... But, uh, this was just handed to me.
[02:48:02.095 --> 02:48:02.915]  BuzzFeed News.
[02:48:03.315 --> 02:48:08.038]  How YouTube channel recommends and pushes users to the fringe.
[02:48:08.938 --> 02:48:16.842]  And then BuzzFeed, the people that gave me the PP dossier and all the rest of it, major Soros funded, say, look, related channels, InfoWars.com, Alex Jones.
[02:48:17.442 --> 02:48:19.103]  Now, they've got a shadow ban still.
[02:48:19.403 --> 02:48:21.224]  They're blocking us because there's a mutiny on YouTube.
[02:48:22.349 --> 02:48:24.471]  But imagine them openly calling.
[02:48:24.751 --> 02:48:30.576]  The old Google algorithm is what's most popular, is what's promoted.
[02:48:30.636 --> 02:48:31.297]  It's called YouTube.
[02:48:31.877 --> 02:48:35.200]  Now for a while YouTube's gotten rid of the original algorithm and it basically broke it.
[02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:37.402]  That's why the search results didn't work for the last few months.
[02:48:38.043 --> 02:48:39.964]  Now they're kind of in between it bringing it back.
[02:48:40.004 --> 02:48:41.125]  There is a war inside it.
[02:48:41.165 --> 02:48:44.208]  Pachenik knows the details from his sources and agencies.
[02:48:44.248 --> 02:48:46.190]  He obviously won't tell us, but he did say this was going to happen.
[02:48:47.827 --> 02:48:49.628]  But there's two points, and then we're going to the calls.
[02:48:49.648 --> 02:48:54.672]  There's the announcement that I need to be banned from the internet and de-platform, that it's bad to let people see my search results.
[02:48:56.053 --> 02:48:59.576]  When Google's unrecognizable to what it used to be just a year ago, it's just horrible.
[02:49:00.096 --> 02:49:01.918]  It's kind of gone back a little bit.
[02:49:01.938 --> 02:49:02.718]  You can see their testing.
[02:49:03.359 --> 02:49:05.501]  When Bing and things like Microsoft are much better.
[02:49:06.647 --> 02:49:06.947]  I don't know.
[02:49:29.433 --> 02:49:35.477]  It is admitted in QTEL and the NASA bases and all of it that, you know, Google was founded basically with NSA technology.
[02:49:35.517 --> 02:49:37.739]  It's a public-private partnership for national security.
[02:49:37.779 --> 02:49:38.139]  I get it.
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:40.120]  And it was a DARPA projection.
[02:49:40.201 --> 02:49:43.203]  That's actually in the, you know, the white papers.
[02:49:43.243 --> 02:49:44.924]  People don't really see that, but that's admitted.
[02:49:45.264 --> 02:49:55.471]  So I knew when you said that days before it was admitted that there was some historical accuracy, but then when it happened and we got restored, it's taken them a month to go through Natural News and thousands of other sites and restore them.
[02:49:56.849 --> 02:49:59.631]  Somebody restores them, then somebody goes in and deletes the subscribers.
[02:49:59.651 --> 02:50:01.032]  Somebody puts the subscribers back in.
[02:50:01.052 --> 02:50:05.796]  When you've got an infrastructure this big, this is a crazy civil war inside Google.
[02:50:06.076 --> 02:50:08.878]  So what can you tell us about the civil war inside Google?
[02:50:09.098 --> 02:50:10.119]  This is just intriguing.
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:18.325]  What's really happening inside Google is that they're going to be losing a lot of their clients as well as the cash flows.
[02:50:18.445 --> 02:50:21.748]  What happened when Zuckerberg came and testified in Congress
[02:50:22.563 --> 02:50:27.447]  It basically tanked Facebook in terms of values.
[02:50:27.647 --> 02:50:40.278]  If you look at Google and its accumulation distribution in the stock market, it has what we call a D to E rating, meaning that nobody wants to accumulate the stock and it's basically a dead asset.
[02:50:40.298 --> 02:50:44.841]  And isn't that a warning to them for their treason, just like Trump just drove down Amazon $34 billion?
[02:50:46.161 --> 02:50:47.782]  Well, that's exactly the point.
[02:50:47.962 --> 02:50:57.205]  But when you don't have investors, particularly the big investors on Wall Street and elsewhere... Investors don't want to invest in authoritarianism.
[02:50:57.285 --> 02:50:57.765]  It sucks!
[02:50:58.686 --> 02:50:58.846]  No.
[02:50:59.246 --> 02:51:00.186]  And that's the point.
[02:51:00.286 --> 02:51:04.308]  Not only don't they want to invest in authoritarianism, they know this is antiquated.
[02:51:04.688 --> 02:51:10.110]  They know that there are other algorithms that are coming in at a much faster rate where we can break Google.
[02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:14.516]  We can break Facebook, we can break any one of these things, and they know it.
[02:51:14.976 --> 02:51:17.360]  The YouTube and Google province really belongs to Trump.
[02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:21.506]  So Trump gave them chances to move forward, they didn't, and now they're going to be put to death politically.
[02:51:23.413 --> 02:51:33.402]  I think so, politically and economically, because Zuckerberg should have been thrown out if you were in any way part of the Sandy Road or Sandy Hill hedge fund.
[02:51:33.602 --> 02:51:36.364]  I would have thrown out Zuckerberg, even though he's the majority holder.
[02:51:36.404 --> 02:51:37.205]  He's a disaster.
[02:51:37.245 --> 02:51:42.209]  By the way, as a psychiatrist, you're not under the Goldwater-Roper's diagnosis, but he is one of the weirdest
[02:51:43.130 --> 02:51:46.294]  I mean, a top actor couldn't act like a robot like him.
[02:51:46.835 --> 02:51:58.048]  The narcissistic little Jewish boy who copied a lot of things, went out of his way to get a movie called Social Network, was not that brilliant, created a story and a narrative.
[02:51:58.388 --> 02:51:59.869]  Like a hundred of these guys.
[02:52:00.129 --> 02:52:01.809]  Basically, he's not the genius.
[02:52:02.169 --> 02:52:07.851]  The genius were the people in the CIA and DARPA when they saw this in the 50s and 60s.
[02:52:07.891 --> 02:52:13.473]  No, my dad saw it when he was just at UT in the Plan 2 when he was in high school.
[02:52:13.834 --> 02:52:17.755]  They were showing CD-ROMs and social networks and InfoG and everything.
[02:52:18.743 --> 02:52:22.028]  All you have in Zuckerberg is a promoter, a self-promoter.
[02:52:22.048 --> 02:52:24.230]  He didn't do anything that was unusual.
[02:52:24.250 --> 02:52:26.413]  He didn't create anything that was unusual.
[02:52:26.473 --> 02:52:33.022]  If you look at social network, you'll see where he stole a lot of things, where in fact he's a faulted character.
[02:52:33.663 --> 02:52:37.728]  I'm not bragging about my dad, but he always talks about the thing he was most proud of when he was like a senior in high school.
[02:52:38.109 --> 02:52:44.638]  He wrote a paper called Information Energy, or Info-G, that then got snatched up, he said, by DARPA, and they asked him never to talk about it.
[02:52:44.978 --> 02:52:50.085]  But I mean, I'm sure other people were simultaneously saying the same thing, but my dad was talking about social networks in like 1967.
[02:52:52.096 --> 02:52:58.926]  Well, the only thing he should have done is, while he was a dentist, he should have started up a company in Austin, and I wish him the best.
[02:52:59.187 --> 02:53:01.350]  But the genes clearly come through to you.
[02:53:01.591 --> 02:53:02.211]  You're bright.
[02:53:02.572 --> 02:53:03.253]  You see it.
[02:53:03.373 --> 02:53:03.954]  You understand it.
[02:53:03.974 --> 02:53:04.495]  Well, how about me?
[02:53:04.555 --> 02:53:06.278]  I'm just saying, I want to know why they're attacking us.
[02:53:08.220 --> 02:53:10.261]  You have to understand it's not just you.
[02:53:10.441 --> 02:53:13.703]  I compare you to the left and to Congress.
[02:53:13.803 --> 02:53:14.323]  They're dead.
[02:53:14.523 --> 02:53:15.624]  They're brain dead.
[02:53:15.664 --> 02:53:16.885]  They don't get any of this.
[02:53:17.205 --> 02:53:18.386]  They don't understand it.
[02:53:18.426 --> 02:53:19.726]  They sit among themselves.
[02:53:20.087 --> 02:53:23.969]  It's like a circle of geriatric patients talking about nonsense.
[02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:30.412]  Whereas we're on the outside accumulating information at a very fast rate and they cannot absorb it.
[02:53:30.452 --> 02:53:39.376]  There's no way they can... Well that's why they got rid of HUMET is because they didn't want us to have the original HUMET and then they rely only on the technocracy which there's so much info it blinds them.
[02:53:40.356 --> 02:53:52.124]  Well, but also they didn't have a character like Alex Jones to be able to articulate the narrative with passion, humor, and zeal, and more importantly, resistance.
[02:53:52.684 --> 02:53:55.866]  That's the one thing that you cannot see on television.
[02:53:55.926 --> 02:53:58.128]  It's the one thing you don't see in the movie business.
[02:53:58.488 --> 02:54:00.329]  It's the one thing you don't see in politics.
[02:54:00.690 --> 02:54:03.992]  They stay there for a few years to get their pension and then they leave.
[02:54:04.432 --> 02:54:13.978]  You don't go into politics if you're an entrepreneur, you're a creator like yourself, you want to break all the paradigms or at least have an American revolution.
[02:54:13.998 --> 02:54:15.519]  You don't go into politics for that.
[02:54:15.799 --> 02:54:17.720]  That's basically for yourself.
[02:54:19.701 --> 02:54:20.582]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[02:54:47.057 --> 02:54:47.737]  I'm doing all right.
[02:54:48.078 --> 02:54:48.878]  Pretty crazy world.
[02:54:48.918 --> 02:54:49.418]  How are you doing?
[02:54:49.438 --> 02:54:51.880]  I'm glad that Trump's backing off World War III talk.
[02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:58.944]  Yeah, no, I think that's all theater actually, but I have a point to do about Comey.
[02:54:59.424 --> 02:55:13.592]  So I just want to make a point about if the Russians were trying to blackmail the incoming president, why wouldn't the FBI and Comey himself do everything in their power to protect him from the blackmail, but instead use it and intimidate him with the information?
[02:55:13.632 --> 02:55:15.153]  That just blows up the entire thing.
[02:55:15.233 --> 02:55:17.115]  That was true, that's collusion with the Russians.
[02:55:17.175 --> 02:55:26.263]  If the president really did it, because of national security, the CIA would be trying to block that and deal with it, instead of the FBI using it, and of course they funded the whole fake thing.
[02:55:29.355 --> 02:55:30.516]  Useless organization.
[02:55:30.616 --> 02:55:42.466]  I told you 30 years ago I had to come in under the Carter administration to take over the Hanafi Muslim where the FBI didn't have the profile, couldn't repel, didn't know what to do, and they were just totally useless.
[02:55:42.586 --> 02:55:46.790]  It's an organization that should be shut down by Trump automatically.
[02:55:46.830 --> 02:55:48.091]  He should fire Mueller.
[02:55:48.411 --> 02:55:49.872]  He should fire Rodenstein.
[02:55:49.912 --> 02:55:51.394]  He should shut down the FBI.
[02:55:51.994 --> 02:55:53.535]  Reconstruct it or leave it there.
[02:55:53.575 --> 02:55:55.537]  We have the ATF, we have Homeland Security.
[02:55:55.557 --> 02:55:57.058]  Well, I was about to say, let's let her finish.
[02:55:57.098 --> 02:56:02.242]  They have built Mueller up like he's the shadow president and they're rogue completely.
[02:56:02.382 --> 02:56:03.863]  Trump has a responsibility to fire him.
[02:56:04.124 --> 02:56:05.144]  I know people say, well, don't do that.
[02:56:05.205 --> 02:56:06.966]  It makes him look like he's guilty.
[02:56:07.526 --> 02:56:09.868]  At a certain point, where are the indictments?
[02:56:09.908 --> 02:56:11.009]  What's up with Rosenstein?
[02:56:11.309 --> 02:56:14.512]  Where is the stuff with Mueller getting in trouble for covering up for Hillary?
[02:56:14.572 --> 02:56:16.293]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:56:16.553 --> 02:56:18.435]  We did not elect Robert Mueller.
[02:56:19.344 --> 02:56:19.964]  I agree with you.
[02:56:20.004 --> 02:56:22.565]  That's why I was asking to fire him years ago.
[02:56:22.585 --> 02:56:23.725]  The man is corrupt.
[02:56:23.805 --> 02:56:25.705]  He was compromised in 9-11.
[02:56:25.745 --> 02:56:27.906]  He took over the FBI a week before 9-11.
[02:56:28.946 --> 02:56:34.687]  This was a former Vietnam War hero who compromised himself and made it disgusting.
[02:56:34.847 --> 02:56:36.628]  He basically is corrupt.
[02:56:36.788 --> 02:56:42.069]  And remember the deputy director tried to stop it and then he took a job at the World Trade Center and died the day of the attack.
[02:56:43.035 --> 02:56:45.516]  Well, there was another person, unfortunately, who died.
[02:56:45.596 --> 02:56:50.997]  It was a CIA operative named John Neal, and he knew exactly what was going on, and he died there.
[02:56:51.057 --> 02:56:55.959]  They had no... Yeah, that's John O'Neill, the Deputy Head of Counterterrorism for the FBI, but you're now saying he was CIA.
[02:56:57.719 --> 02:56:57.939]  Yes.
[02:56:59.300 --> 02:56:59.440]  Yeah.
[02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:03.001]  So the whole point is, is that that's how crazy this is.
[02:57:03.021 --> 02:57:04.341]  There are good people in the government.
[02:57:04.902 --> 02:57:06.102]  Catherine, go ahead and finish up.
[02:57:07.356 --> 02:57:15.920]  I just think when the Inspector General's report starts to drop portions of it, I think their whole narrative is going to blow up, and I think you might see some indictments by then.
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:19.502]  I think they're waiting for the Comey book to counter it with the OIG.
[02:57:20.242 --> 02:57:20.642]  No, I agree.
[02:57:20.662 --> 02:57:22.223]  That's when Trump punches back.
[02:57:22.283 --> 02:57:24.204]  I want to ask Dr. Corsi when we come back, though.
[02:57:24.964 --> 02:57:30.987]  We're trying, not Dr. Corsi, I want to get Dr. Corsi's coming up later today on the show, I think during the war, and that's why I said that.
[02:57:31.227 --> 02:57:32.608]  Dr. Pachinick, cpachinick.com.
[02:57:33.948 --> 02:57:40.813]  I want to ask him about, what do we do though if they kill Trump or they stage a bunch more false flags?
[02:57:40.833 --> 02:57:44.556]  Because we know they're desperate, they're crazy, they have the strength of crazy criminals.
[02:57:45.076 --> 02:57:47.438]  What do we do about that if they start a civil war?
[02:57:47.458 --> 02:57:48.179]  Because it could go that way.

[02:58:49.645 --> 02:58:52.848]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:58:53.288 --> 02:58:54.609]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:55.090 --> 02:59:06.519]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:59:07.299 --> 02:59:16.223]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:59:16.623 --> 02:59:22.466]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:59:22.686 --> 02:59:27.348]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:27.848 --> 02:59:30.169]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:59:30.509 --> 02:59:31.810]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:32.250 --> 02:59:41.856]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:41.956 --> 02:59:44.098]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:59:44.638 --> 02:59:49.541]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:59:51.162 --> 02:59:57.066]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.199 --> 03:00:20.640]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:20.900 --> 03:00:21.941]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.541 --> 03:00:26.983]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:27.024 --> 03:00:30.005]  Alright, folks.
[03:00:31.246 --> 03:00:33.767]  We're here talking to Steve Pchenik, this segment and the next, going right to your calls.
[03:00:33.847 --> 03:00:36.429]  I just wanted to ask Dr. Pchenik of StevePchenik.com.
[03:00:39.048 --> 03:00:42.230]  Looking at this, the Democrats are hashtag hunt Republicans.
[03:00:42.631 --> 03:00:44.552]  We've got documents that we've confirmed are real.
[03:00:44.933 --> 03:00:49.876]  George Soros hasn't denied them, his son hasn't denied them that they're trying to cause race war, civil war on the streets.
[03:00:49.936 --> 03:00:57.302]  They've not been successful with how they work with Blue City, Democrat police departments, where they're knocking windows out and burning trash cans, but it's scripted.
[03:00:57.322 --> 03:00:58.423]  They have a threat continuum.
[03:00:58.483 --> 03:00:59.724]  It's all planned out.
[03:00:59.744 --> 03:01:01.385]  They're trying to get other people to get violent.
[03:01:01.985 --> 03:01:03.046]  We published that months ago.
[03:01:03.066 --> 03:01:05.168]  I mean, this is serious criminal activity.
[03:01:06.983 --> 03:01:10.207]  We don't want to be too precipitous to clean them out.
[03:01:10.528 --> 03:01:13.992]  I'm not an authoritarian, I'm a libertarian, but I feel derelict.
[03:01:14.929 --> 03:01:32.636]  Watching them do this, and them trying to gear up a coup, and just all the wild-eyedness that's going on, and trying to sabotage the economy, and we have a clear and present danger, a book he wrote, turned into a movie, here in this country, and I don't want to underestimate these people, that's all I'm saying.
[03:01:33.136 --> 03:01:35.677]  What keeps you awake at night, Dr. Pucinich?
[03:01:35.717 --> 03:01:40.159]  I mean, I know we're winning overall Americana free market worldwide, but
[03:01:41.874 --> 03:01:46.942]  They could grab victory from the jaws of defeat, and I don't want to also give them ideas, because I used to think they were smart.
[03:01:46.962 --> 03:01:49.686]  I realize they're just dumb, but they're like cancer, willing to take over.
[03:01:49.706 --> 03:01:50.448]  That's why they're in power.
[03:01:50.468 --> 03:01:52.330]  But how are they going to strike back?
[03:01:54.068 --> 03:01:57.809]  What do we do if they start killing people, or they stage a bunch more false flags?
[03:01:58.109 --> 03:01:58.969]  We know they're doing that.
[03:01:58.989 --> 03:02:02.590]  We know they're winding it up, preparing it, lining the people up, standing down.
[03:02:02.610 --> 03:02:05.531]  I mean, and they're so pissed we're exposing that.
[03:02:06.411 --> 03:02:09.972]  That tells me that they want me discredited ahead of the next narrative they launch.
[03:02:10.532 --> 03:02:11.372]  They don't even get to that.
[03:02:11.392 --> 03:02:12.172]  People tune in even more.
[03:02:12.192 --> 03:02:15.153]  They're just so... They have this... I mean, you're the psychiatrist.
[03:02:15.193 --> 03:02:19.754]  There's narcissism where they think they're invincible, but that's their weakness and their strength, isn't it?
[03:02:21.403 --> 03:02:22.844]  No, it's more of their weakness.
[03:02:22.924 --> 03:02:25.066]  It's not even an issue of narcissism.
[03:02:25.166 --> 03:02:28.849]  It's grandiosity that really has no basis in reality.
[03:02:28.969 --> 03:02:35.895]  All they're doing is, the tighter they become on the target, which is yourself, me, or Trump.
[03:02:35.975 --> 03:02:37.016]  Target psychosis!
[03:02:38.277 --> 03:02:38.697]  I'm sorry?
[03:02:38.858 --> 03:02:39.718]  Target psychosis?
[03:02:40.299 --> 03:02:43.461]  Well, we say your fixation on a target.
[03:02:43.622 --> 03:02:45.643]  That's basically what we say in the military.
[03:02:45.683 --> 03:02:47.565]  So you've missed the entire target.
[03:02:48.101 --> 03:02:56.130]  And at the same time, while they're focusing in on Trump, he's being able to retaliate so fast.
[03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:58.273]  And it's not only the Democrats.
[03:02:58.353 --> 03:03:00.335]  What he's done is to make sure Ryan is there.
[03:03:00.355 --> 03:03:01.616]  Oh yeah, why is Paul Ryan leaving?
[03:03:01.636 --> 03:03:02.457]  I forgot that question.
[03:03:03.218 --> 03:03:05.040]  Yeah, I mean, this is not an accident.
[03:03:05.060 --> 03:03:07.283]  You predicted six months ago that he'd be going.
[03:03:08.024 --> 03:03:08.444]  Correct.
[03:03:08.584 --> 03:03:19.953]  And I said there would be 20 to 25 different Republicans, so-called Republicans, who are moderates or didn't support Tom, have no idea what he's doing, have no idea where the Republican... And they're leaving.
[03:03:20.554 --> 03:03:22.375]  And that was part of his agenda.
[03:03:22.455 --> 03:03:24.477]  Except he didn't say it outright.
[03:03:24.777 --> 03:03:26.839]  He said, you're either with me or against me.
[03:03:26.879 --> 03:03:31.222]  But the tighter you come in on him, the more effective he becomes.
[03:03:31.282 --> 03:03:34.945]  And that's why you, myself and I... What keeps me up at night?
[03:03:35.660 --> 03:03:36.681]  Not really very much.
[03:03:36.901 --> 03:03:41.303]  I go up the next day and I say, okay, is my garbage can gone?
[03:03:41.383 --> 03:03:42.443]  No, I get it.
[03:03:42.483 --> 03:03:42.904]  Here's the thing.
[03:03:43.004 --> 03:03:49.307]  We can all put a good face on it and things are going our way, the worm's turning, but they are bullying the hell out of individuals.
[03:03:49.407 --> 03:03:53.209]  I mean, I want to look at the negative position here.
[03:03:53.973 --> 03:03:59.017]  The negative position is basically repetition again and again.
[03:03:59.077 --> 03:04:03.101]  It's almost repetition compulsion of a neurotic or a psychotic person.
[03:04:03.121 --> 03:04:04.302]  They repeat the same thing.
[03:04:04.322 --> 03:04:05.363]  It's a mantra.
[03:04:05.523 --> 03:04:06.324]  There's a mantra.
[03:04:07.004 --> 03:04:07.345]  Correct.
[03:04:07.425 --> 03:04:08.105]  It's a mantra.
[03:04:08.165 --> 03:04:08.946]  He's lazy.
[03:04:08.986 --> 03:04:09.607]  He's tired.
[03:04:09.627 --> 03:04:10.768]  He doesn't know what to do.
[03:04:10.788 --> 03:04:11.869]  It was in the New York Times.
[03:04:12.209 --> 03:04:12.929]  He's crazy.
[03:04:12.969 --> 03:04:13.530]  He's stupid.
[03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:14.951]  He needs to not listen to that.
[03:04:14.991 --> 03:04:16.472]  He needs to stop reading the New York Times.
[03:04:17.381 --> 03:04:22.266]  Not really, because what happens in turn, it's really paradoxical intention.
[03:04:22.366 --> 03:04:25.889]  I'd like him to listen to it, because what he does... It makes him come back stronger.
[03:04:26.270 --> 03:04:35.799]  He comes back stronger, and then you see the real Twitter war, where he comes in and he will devastate people right and left, and they don't really understand what happened.
[03:04:36.179 --> 03:04:38.001]  So they think he's uncontrollable.
[03:04:38.181 --> 03:04:39.583]  No, he's very controllable.
[03:04:39.823 --> 03:04:42.705]  It's only he has to depend on what time he does it.
[03:04:43.106 --> 03:04:49.051]  He has to listen to his friends, or as Landowsky and Stone have said, let him be Trump.
[03:04:49.412 --> 03:04:50.553]  He's going to be what he is.
[03:04:50.593 --> 03:04:52.515]  He built a billion dollar business.
[03:04:52.575 --> 03:04:54.797]  He went out of his way to build us an economy.
[03:04:54.817 --> 03:04:55.578]  He did it his way.
[03:04:55.598 --> 03:04:58.260]  We'll be back with Carlos, Jeff, Ryan, Matt, David, and Nemo.
[03:04:58.500 --> 03:04:58.821]  Stay there.
[03:05:00.578 --> 03:05:07.823]  Did President Trump nearly fire special counsel Robert Mueller in December 2017 after the publication of some fake news?
[03:05:08.044 --> 03:05:16.690]  According to a New York Times article published this week, Trump told advisers to fire Mueller following reports the special counsel's office subpoenaed his bank records.
[03:05:16.870 --> 03:05:21.734]  The Times reported that Trump believed the subpoenas crossed a red line he'd set for the Mueller probe.
[03:05:21.894 --> 03:05:29.720]  The stories about the bank subpoenas, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and Bloomberg, turned out to be inaccurate and the outlets issued a correction.
[03:05:30.100 --> 03:05:30.961]  This week, the President tweeted,
[03:06:11.989 --> 03:06:15.912]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:06:16.413 --> 03:06:17.914]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:19.395 --> 03:06:23.358]  Alright, I get so wrapped up in target fixation that I don't even plug last hour.
[03:06:24.299 --> 03:06:25.000]  And why wouldn't I?
[03:06:25.974 --> 03:06:27.975]  One plug can deal with one of these lawsuits.
[03:06:28.856 --> 03:06:29.877]  And that's the good news.
[03:06:29.957 --> 03:06:33.279]  The bad news is they got notice of two more to be filed next week.
[03:06:33.639 --> 03:06:34.320]  These are bigger.
[03:06:34.400 --> 03:06:35.180]  They're still frauds.
[03:06:35.961 --> 03:06:39.723]  We had, I got corrected yesterday by the lawyers, we had two dismissed last week.
[03:06:39.823 --> 03:06:43.206]  One was about a thousand, one was ten thousand in lawyers fees to get it dismissed.
[03:06:43.306 --> 03:06:50.971]  And I mean, but these lawyer mills just turn up the heat and just, it's like all former Clinton lawyers and Soros people.
[03:06:51.972 --> 03:06:53.473]  We've got to do slapback suits.
[03:06:54.554 --> 03:06:54.814]  to go.
[03:07:09.525 --> 03:07:15.468]  Older uncle went down on a boat carrying weapons to England in World War II and his family died in Vietnam.
[03:07:15.508 --> 03:07:21.190]  They had really tough jobs with all the foot rot and the VCs and you know and Korean War and everything.
[03:07:21.690 --> 03:07:22.611]  So I'm not a hero.
[03:07:22.931 --> 03:07:26.072]  I'm really blessed to be fighting these people and just have sorrows suing me and stuff.
[03:07:26.392 --> 03:07:27.973]  I'm glad they haven't sent somebody to kill me.
[03:07:29.158 --> 03:07:30.239]  But they know they're being watched.
[03:07:30.259 --> 03:07:31.520]  They know they can't get away with that now.
[03:07:31.540 --> 03:07:32.580]  It's a 21st century war.
[03:07:32.660 --> 03:07:34.301]  I'm just saying it's an epic time to be alive.
[03:07:34.822 --> 03:07:37.444]  We have the very best deep earth iodine.
[03:07:37.484 --> 03:07:38.284]  Nobody else has it.
[03:07:38.844 --> 03:07:39.905]  People are trying to figure that out.
[03:07:40.526 --> 03:07:42.147]  Now companies are coming in wanting to buy it up.
[03:07:42.187 --> 03:07:45.069]  It's about to be in shampoos and stuff that a major company is going to put out.
[03:07:45.709 --> 03:07:45.989]  I don't know.
[03:08:05.894 --> 03:08:06.475]  Is a big deal.
[03:08:06.495 --> 03:08:09.978]  Even though we sell a lot of it, we're still not in the market compared to oil and gas.
[03:08:10.018 --> 03:08:13.081]  So, this is pure, true atomic iodine.
[03:08:13.121 --> 03:08:13.942]  Nobody else has it.
[03:08:14.643 --> 03:08:21.289]  We had folks harass us and try to stop us five years ago to kill our clean seaweed version that was a lot weaker but still pure, but it wasn't atomic.
[03:08:21.770 --> 03:08:23.771]  So we ended up getting this just by the grace of God.
[03:08:23.832 --> 03:08:24.752]  Well, it could be over.
[03:08:25.573 --> 03:08:27.153]  And believe me, I'm not happy about that.
[03:08:27.173 --> 03:08:28.134]  We're about to sell out of it.
[03:08:28.154 --> 03:08:29.754]  We got maybe two more runs we can do.
[03:08:30.254 --> 03:08:31.995]  But that shipment's already going up.
[03:08:32.015 --> 03:08:34.115]  It's got to be kept in a DEA facility in Houston.
[03:08:34.135 --> 03:08:38.456]  And then it's made in a special lab because pure iodine obviously has other uses.
[03:08:38.516 --> 03:08:39.997]  Once it's put in the palm oil, it doesn't.
[03:08:40.657 --> 03:08:44.498]  But it's key to IQ, stamina, energy.
[03:08:44.818 --> 03:08:45.638]  It's made me lazy.
[03:08:46.158 --> 03:08:49.859]  I was swimming two miles every other day, everything, and couldn't lose weight six years ago.
[03:08:50.359 --> 03:08:53.822]  I went on pure atomic iodine and it was just like I lost 40 pounds.
[03:08:54.002 --> 03:08:54.762]  It just made me lazy.
[03:08:54.782 --> 03:08:55.783]  I haven't even worked out this week.
[03:08:56.224 --> 03:08:58.145]  And I'm skinnier than I was, you know, six, seven years ago.
[03:08:58.165 --> 03:08:59.406]  I mean, I'm jet up.
[03:08:59.446 --> 03:09:01.828]  I'm a husky guy, but I've actually lost a lot of weight.
[03:09:03.009 --> 03:09:05.410]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:09:05.831 --> 03:09:09.313]  And on Monday, I'm going to go back to full price, which is 40 bucks.
[03:09:10.754 --> 03:09:13.436]  And again, we don't put seven time markups on these products.
[03:09:13.476 --> 03:09:14.317]  We put on average about 150%.
[03:09:14.357 --> 03:09:15.017]  That's one and a half markup.
[03:09:17.412 --> 03:09:20.353]  I'm thinking about not doing that anymore just because of all the globalist operations.
[03:09:20.914 --> 03:09:25.115]  I want to give, you know, and I could play the game of raising the price then lowering it and saying it's 50% off.
[03:09:25.596 --> 03:09:27.937]  When we say 50% off, it's really 50% off.
[03:09:27.957 --> 03:09:29.017]  Well, it's 25% off right now.
[03:09:29.317 --> 03:09:30.098]  That's about to end.
[03:09:30.418 --> 03:09:32.779]  Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula is back in stock.
[03:09:32.819 --> 03:09:33.879]  Great anti-inflammatory.
[03:09:34.379 --> 03:09:34.880]  That's there.
[03:09:35.220 --> 03:09:36.020]  So many other products.
[03:09:36.100 --> 03:09:37.381]  Alpha Power is back in stock, 25% off.
[03:09:37.401 --> 03:09:40.242]  You get free shipping on orders for $50 or more.
[03:09:40.282 --> 03:09:40.862]  But just know this.
[03:09:42.443 --> 03:09:44.524]  You cannot give the globalist a bigger black eye.
[03:09:45.532 --> 03:09:58.316]  And stand up against them in supporting free speech, because they see this show and our guests as a constellation of resistance and information that's so close to what's really going on, not that we're perfect, we all see through rose-colored glasses, that they want it shut down.
[03:09:58.336 --> 03:09:59.056]  And I agree with Pachinko.
[03:10:00.276 --> 03:10:10.299]  The one-dimensional thing of crushing us when we already did our job, we still want to be here and still want to help and all the rest of it, but there's a real satisfaction in being the rock that hits the pond.
[03:10:10.879 --> 03:10:13.561]  Because your parents and your ancestors and the culture got you there.
[03:10:13.581 --> 03:10:14.142]  They threw you.
[03:10:14.622 --> 03:10:20.948]  You hit, and then the waves have already gone back and bounced back, and by then they realize that you see a hundred more rocks about to hit.
[03:10:20.968 --> 03:10:23.129]  They don't even see the hundred other rocks in the air.
[03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:30.195]  They're worried about crushing the spot where the rock hit 23 years ago, and they don't even get that already it's an exponential wave.
[03:10:30.215 --> 03:10:34.999]  But quite frankly, that wave, Dr. Pichettino will go to call, scares me because the unknown
[03:10:36.403 --> 03:10:37.043]  Let me put it this way.
[03:10:37.063 --> 03:10:38.084]  You and I have had lawsuits.
[03:10:38.104 --> 03:10:40.184]  I've had them since I left medical school in 1968.
[03:10:40.224 --> 03:10:41.344]  So in every business I was in.
[03:10:58.965 --> 03:10:59.125]  Yes.
[03:11:14.347 --> 03:11:28.655]  To really go into a kind of a mutual relationship with the adversary where we can tone down the rhetoric, tone down the emotions and allow the kabuki, whether it's right or wrong, the kabuki of so-called justice to play out.
[03:11:29.115 --> 03:11:30.756]  So I have been there with you.
[03:11:30.836 --> 03:11:34.038]  I'm still there with you filing lawsuits against the mind.
[03:11:34.478 --> 03:11:34.578]  Yes.
[03:11:54.116 --> 03:11:55.357]  The lawyers love this.
[03:11:55.737 --> 03:11:58.079]  Unfortunately, that's the way our system works.
[03:11:58.439 --> 03:11:59.119]  But it works.
[03:11:59.200 --> 03:12:05.344]  When you push back, the system doesn't want to continue to keep paying and hitting Alex Jones.
[03:12:05.624 --> 03:12:07.925]  That's the same way I would go all the time.
[03:12:07.965 --> 03:12:12.889]  I'd have to hire a lawyer in Hollywood, a lawyer in the publishing industry, a lawyer here.
[03:12:13.029 --> 03:12:14.530]  Everywhere I looked, I had a lawyer.
[03:12:15.070 --> 03:12:21.013]  But, for the most part, they are your allies in order to create a new narrative.
[03:12:21.033 --> 03:12:24.934]  Well, I gotta say, it's the Republican lawyers that are always the good ones, it's the Democrats that are the bad ones.
[03:12:24.974 --> 03:12:29.376]  I mean, more and more I realize that the Republican establishment's bad, but the Democrat lawyers are the scum of the earth.
[03:12:29.717 --> 03:12:31.797]  Carlos in Canada, you're on the air with Dr. Steve Pichanik.
[03:12:31.817 --> 03:12:32.138]  Go ahead.
[03:12:32.238 --> 03:12:32.698]  Thanks for holding.
[03:12:33.888 --> 03:12:35.069]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:12:35.189 --> 03:12:38.131]  It's a great pleasure to speak to both of you.
[03:12:39.171 --> 03:12:41.213]  Most informative and powerful analysis.
[03:12:42.153 --> 03:12:47.076]  I wanted to draw your attention to what is defined as the swamp.
[03:12:48.507 --> 03:13:05.926]  In my opinion, the problem in the United States which President Trump can solve, not easily, but he is able to, is that the problem of congressmen and senators who receive money from foreign powers indirectly through agencies and friends and so on,
[03:13:10.369 --> 03:13:15.274]  Exactly.
[03:13:15.314 --> 03:13:19.717]  The idea that Trump's a foreign power when it's the globalists that have sold us out is asinine.
[03:13:20.278 --> 03:13:20.978]  So what do we do?
[03:13:21.038 --> 03:13:22.059]  How do we identify the swamp?
[03:13:22.279 --> 03:13:23.280]  He didn't hire any lobbyists.
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:26.583]  How does Trump go completely ape and start indicting a bunch of these people?
[03:13:27.717 --> 03:13:35.499]  Well, it's a matter of democracy, information, a matter of informing the public as to who's taking money from where.
[03:13:35.839 --> 03:13:38.120]  Some of these people are room temperature IQ.
[03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:39.020]  I mean, it's insane.
[03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:39.820]  Well, they're so dumb.
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:40.340]  The U.S.
[03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:43.561]  had half the world industrial power 30, 40 years ago.
[03:13:43.881 --> 03:13:51.683]  They sold it out to corporations for little nickel and dime power when we could have projected freedom worldwide, built everybody up, and been in charge of it all.
[03:13:51.923 --> 03:13:56.884]  They literally gave away the perfect free market system of world government.
[03:13:57.104 --> 03:13:59.684]  They, the globalists, are the biggest idiots on the planet.
[03:14:00.725 --> 03:14:20.508]  Yes, and as it turns out, you've got a situation where a foreign leader of, could be Saudi Arabia or Israel, can go to the Senate, to the Congress, get standing ovations, you know, to the embarrassment of the President, to the embarrassment of the community they're supposed to serve, and turn around and, ignoring things like the Symington
[03:14:25.191 --> 03:14:25.812]  Absolutely.
[03:14:26.032 --> 03:14:33.878]  What about boomeranging around like Trump let the submariner off the show to a 50-year-old submarine, it was no big deal, it was all bull, they found it in a landfill, clearly a setup.
[03:14:34.639 --> 03:14:38.382]  He pardoned that guy because he's showing how Hillary did a thousand, ten thousand times that.
[03:14:38.862 --> 03:14:40.203]  What about boomeranging back?
[03:14:40.604 --> 03:14:44.026]  I mean, why won't the Justice Department, Dr. Pucinich, go after
[03:14:45.299 --> 03:14:48.361]  All the clear sellouts to foreign powers that Hillary got caught in.
[03:14:48.721 --> 03:14:49.061]  Why?
[03:14:49.221 --> 03:14:49.501]  Why?
[03:14:49.801 --> 03:14:49.982]  Why?
[03:14:50.002 --> 03:14:52.563]  Like you said, why does he fire Rosenstein and these people?
[03:14:54.284 --> 03:14:56.325]  I don't know why he doesn't fire them.
[03:14:56.385 --> 03:15:01.868]  I can tell you I wouldn't trust them because most of them are bureaucrats who have really no vested interest.
[03:15:02.429 --> 03:15:11.072]  In serving our country, what they basically do along with the politician is their concern about their own viability or their own livelihood.
[03:15:11.472 --> 03:15:22.156]  If you look at a congressman or senator... But don't they get if they bet on a country like this with the resources and the culture, they get everything by betting on the country instead of worrying about their own stupid asses?
[03:15:23.384 --> 03:15:24.964]  Then I'm looking at the United States.
[03:15:25.004 --> 03:15:30.585]  They're looking at their own specific amount of money that they received this Saturday.
[03:15:30.605 --> 03:15:31.006]  No, I agree.
[03:15:31.026 --> 03:15:33.086]  They think Trump's mentally ill because he cares about America.
[03:15:33.426 --> 03:15:34.186]  It's America.
[03:15:34.286 --> 03:15:35.726]  It is exceptional, idiots.
[03:15:36.527 --> 03:15:37.387]  It's the Renaissance.
[03:15:37.427 --> 03:15:38.427]  We have to bet on it.
[03:15:38.527 --> 03:15:39.747]  Or the chi-coms.
[03:15:39.767 --> 03:15:41.868]  We're going to do one more segment and then Joel Gilbert's coming up.
[03:15:42.088 --> 03:15:42.668]  Thank you, Carlos.
[03:15:42.688 --> 03:15:45.068]  We're going to go Jeff, Ryan, Matt, Nemo, and David.
[03:15:45.108 --> 03:15:46.749]  I swear we're going to each call her one minute.
[03:15:47.029 --> 03:15:49.049]  We'll have 30 seconds on each caller and I'm going to shut up.
[03:15:49.449 --> 03:15:51.192]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:15:51.352 --> 03:15:54.056]  And when he's your financial supporter, George Soros wins.
[03:15:54.296 --> 03:15:55.038]  He's not gonna win.
[03:15:55.358 --> 03:15:57.020]  That guy's not gonna be around much longer, is he?
[03:16:04.292 --> 03:16:13.062]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[03:16:13.462 --> 03:16:20.831]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:16:21.151 --> 03:16:22.653]  No longer 5%, but now 10% at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:16:32.250 --> 03:16:44.099]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[03:16:44.760 --> 03:16:54.087]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[03:16:54.287 --> 03:16:59.111]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[03:16:59.611 --> 03:17:08.919]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[03:17:09.760 --> 03:17:14.484]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[03:17:14.504 --> 03:17:16.026]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[03:17:16.626 --> 03:17:22.892]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[03:17:22.992 --> 03:17:23.753]  Here's my problem.
[03:17:24.273 --> 03:17:32.700]  When I do take the bodies and the ex-tuit things, I'm already so craved and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[03:17:35.102 --> 03:17:39.245]  Neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[03:17:39.585 --> 03:17:44.849]  This is an incredible time to be alive and I'm glad you mentioned that because bodies have just come back in.
[03:17:45.009 --> 03:17:48.552]  It's 25% off and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[03:17:48.852 --> 03:17:52.796]  We went out with the top labs and said we want the strongest concentrate
[03:17:53.456 --> 03:18:00.960]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[03:18:13.848 --> 03:18:19.450]  Now, your product is an extract, and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[03:18:19.670 --> 03:18:24.132]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[03:18:24.733 --> 03:18:27.934]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[03:18:28.294 --> 03:18:33.716]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[03:18:33.756 --> 03:18:35.397]  Well, that's another reason.
[03:18:35.457 --> 03:18:37.538]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that.
[03:18:37.558 --> 03:18:42.440]  They said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[03:18:42.600 --> 03:18:42.981]  Exactly.
[03:18:43.141 --> 03:18:50.028]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[03:18:50.329 --> 03:18:54.834]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[03:18:59.747 --> 03:19:05.831]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[03:19:06.051 --> 03:19:14.317]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[03:19:14.457 --> 03:19:19.200]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[03:19:19.541 --> 03:19:20.261]  We only have 150%.
[03:19:20.301 --> 03:19:21.422]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[03:19:23.263 --> 03:19:25.545]  Well now it's 50% off.
[03:19:26.085 --> 03:19:34.491]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[03:19:34.511 --> 03:19:36.032]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[03:19:36.333 --> 03:19:37.734]  But the two go together.
[03:19:37.834 --> 03:19:39.495]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[03:19:39.855 --> 03:19:44.218]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off.
[03:19:45.439 --> 03:19:49.061]  And free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:19:49.341 --> 03:19:54.144]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[03:19:54.544 --> 03:19:58.926]  InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[03:20:02.408 --> 03:20:05.030]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:11.451 --> 03:20:16.493]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:20:17.858 --> 03:20:19.059]  Alright, we're going right to your phone calls.
[03:20:19.119 --> 03:20:20.621]  Final segment with Dr. Steve Pchenik.
[03:20:20.641 --> 03:20:21.442]  StevePchenik.com.
[03:20:21.482 --> 03:20:27.307]  Then, we've got a great guest host coming up, Joel Gilbert, with a big guest and a key breaking intel.
[03:20:27.327 --> 03:20:28.428]  Always has amazing guests on.
[03:20:29.189 --> 03:20:32.212]  Joel lets me pop in here on these Friday editions when I need to go over.
[03:20:32.252 --> 03:20:32.833]  I appreciate him.
[03:20:33.433 --> 03:20:36.757]  He's welcome to come back later during the 34-hour broadcast on The War Room as well.
[03:20:37.718 --> 03:20:38.679]  Filmmaker Joel Gilbert.
[03:20:39.539 --> 03:20:41.561]  But when I am openly saying that
[03:20:42.734 --> 03:20:47.035]  Humanity needs a world government that doesn't have governmental power.
[03:20:47.555 --> 03:20:52.856]  It needs a system where people come together, they discuss, they make unilateral deals country to country.
[03:20:53.477 --> 03:21:00.278]  That's the next step in humanity, but not some secret authoritarian thing where corporations that are greedy run it, or you get rid of sovereignty.
[03:21:00.358 --> 03:21:03.779]  I see it as America, 1776, worldwide is what I call it.
[03:21:04.899 --> 03:21:10.981]  And true free market and true open societies, countering George Soros' open society, that's a counterfeit and a fraud of that.
[03:21:11.761 --> 03:21:21.064]  So I made that point that America, with all its wealth, all its power, because it was the most free country in the world, had the whole future ahead of it, but the robber barons leveraged this out.
[03:21:21.084 --> 03:21:28.107]  You know, the smarts of the yeoman farmer and the folks working in factories couldn't translate into the robber barons and the big elites.
[03:21:28.647 --> 03:21:34.489]  And so we've now seen the globalist last half century, but that thing is coming to an end and they're panicking.
[03:21:34.509 --> 03:21:36.150]  You know, Dr. Buchanan, we're going to these calls right now, but
[03:21:37.023 --> 03:21:38.323]  I think we're winning already.
[03:21:38.403 --> 03:21:39.224]  The fact is, look at the economy.
[03:21:39.244 --> 03:21:39.624]  It's been on a roar.
[03:21:39.644 --> 03:21:41.484]  I mean, we have really had an incredible growth.
[03:22:06.553 --> 03:22:10.219]  We've had the lowest unemployment rate in years.
[03:22:10.840 --> 03:22:18.953]  We have been able to finish a war in Iraq and in Syria and pretty much in Afghanistan.
[03:22:19.194 --> 03:22:21.137]  I mean, we are in great shape.
[03:22:21.656 --> 03:22:26.900]  The real issue for the globalists is that they do not understand what America is about.
[03:22:27.020 --> 03:22:33.244]  Soros is what we call the Judenrat Hungarian Jew, who really is not relevant to us.
[03:22:33.724 --> 03:22:35.846]  He was a traitor to other people.
[03:22:35.926 --> 03:22:42.390]  I mean, when you are basically compromised in your character, the rest of your life you're compromised.
[03:22:42.410 --> 03:22:43.191]  What would that mean?
[03:22:44.112 --> 03:22:47.354]  Again, as a psychiatrist studying his activities, what is his problem?
[03:22:48.246 --> 03:22:56.672]  His problem is, I could give you a psychiatric diagnosis, but he's pretty much of an a-hole.
[03:22:56.892 --> 03:23:00.375]  I mean, that's what I would say is his diagnosis.
[03:23:00.435 --> 03:23:01.676]  He's a raving a-hole.
[03:23:02.076 --> 03:23:09.922]  I know, I've met him, I find him totally ignorant and totally unpleasant, but he's not the relevant part.
[03:23:10.342 --> 03:23:16.447]  What's relevant is for you to maintain and for us to maintain where the country is going at a very fast rate.
[03:23:16.867 --> 03:23:22.015]  We're starting to get millennials into the political system who watch you, who listen to you.
[03:23:22.335 --> 03:23:25.981]  Whether they're the left or the right, they're coming in and they're beginning to understand.
[03:23:26.021 --> 03:23:29.005]  Number one, you serve the country however you want to serve it.
[03:23:29.045 --> 03:23:31.970]  Number two, you then come back and serve it in a civilian form.
[03:23:32.430 --> 03:23:35.251]  Number three, you get involved in local politics.
[03:23:35.331 --> 03:23:37.152]  As LBJ, it's always local.
[03:23:37.612 --> 03:23:42.214]  The Osoroses and the Peloses and the Feinstein, they're fossils.
[03:23:42.555 --> 03:23:43.675]  No, I agree.
[03:23:43.695 --> 03:23:46.236]  Their huge exhibition of energy is their death throes.
[03:23:46.256 --> 03:23:48.457]  That is the true statement today.
[03:23:48.938 --> 03:23:50.138]  David in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[03:23:50.178 --> 03:23:50.458]  Go ahead.
[03:23:50.478 --> 03:23:50.978]  Thanks for holding.
[03:23:52.699 --> 03:23:53.179]  Yes, sir.
[03:23:53.379 --> 03:24:01.083]  I want you to know that you have a great following within the 18 Wheeler community, and we really appreciate the information that we get.
[03:24:02.208 --> 03:24:05.713]  I'm a big fan of the Brain Force, the Alpha Male.
[03:24:07.216 --> 03:24:17.451]  I've used many of your products and it took a few weeks for it to come to where I could tell, but my doctor told me I needed vitamin D. I used your bone and joint.
[03:24:17.930 --> 03:24:21.232]  I use your winter sun and what a big difference.
[03:24:21.292 --> 03:24:22.393]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[03:24:22.433 --> 03:24:23.734]  We don't just give people stimulants.
[03:24:23.754 --> 03:24:27.276]  We give them what the top scientists, not me, say is the building blocks you're missing.
[03:24:27.576 --> 03:24:28.617]  So it takes a few weeks.
[03:24:28.677 --> 03:24:28.977]  Exactly.
[03:24:28.997 --> 03:24:31.478]  This is not instant, you know, paper over stuff.
[03:24:31.498 --> 03:24:33.920]  This is, this takes a few weeks like X2, you name it.
[03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:35.101]  But once it kicks in.
[03:24:36.502 --> 03:24:36.722]  Yeah.
[03:24:36.742 --> 03:24:40.144]  And once it kicks in and then, you know, there's times when I have to drive all night.
[03:24:40.544 --> 03:24:41.825]  I take two brain force.
[03:24:42.412 --> 03:24:44.273]  It doesn't matter if I even drink coffee.
[03:24:44.333 --> 03:24:45.814]  I don't even need coffee.
[03:24:46.194 --> 03:24:48.855]  And it's clear I can concentrate on my driving.
[03:24:49.456 --> 03:24:54.478]  And I just want you to know that I have contributed.
[03:24:55.739 --> 03:24:58.480]  I'm probably coming up on $1,000 right now of products.
[03:24:58.580 --> 03:24:59.681]  I've got over 2,500 points of
[03:25:02.540 --> 03:25:05.841]  Patriot Points right now, and I'm going to order some more stuff today.
[03:25:05.961 --> 03:25:06.981]  Well, let me say this, David.
[03:25:07.581 --> 03:25:09.202]  If you weren't here, we'd be shut down.
[03:25:09.222 --> 03:25:13.023]  I mean, I don't just tell the audiences to patronize.
[03:25:13.143 --> 03:25:15.824]  If you weren't supporting, we wouldn't have Trump in.
[03:25:16.224 --> 03:25:17.364]  We wouldn't have this platform.
[03:25:17.424 --> 03:25:18.044]  It'd be all over.
[03:25:18.104 --> 03:25:20.145]  So thank you so much for your support, sir.
[03:25:21.305 --> 03:25:21.605]  Yes, sir.
[03:25:22.045 --> 03:25:23.706]  I appreciate it.
[03:25:23.906 --> 03:25:25.066]  I fly in for awards.
[03:25:25.426 --> 03:25:26.207]  Your bumper stickers.
[03:25:26.247 --> 03:25:27.767]  I get bumper stickers when I order stuff.
[03:25:27.807 --> 03:25:31.208]  I put it on my window on the inside so it can't be removed.
[03:25:32.041 --> 03:25:41.427]  And I'll tell you what, I have conversations, I wear your t-shirts, and I wore one, you know, Hillary from prison had Gerald Searles on the back of it.
[03:25:41.863 --> 03:25:47.627]  And I'm waiting there to pay for stuff, and these drivers come up to you and start talking about George Soros.
[03:25:47.707 --> 03:25:48.468]  I mean, we know.
[03:25:48.888 --> 03:25:53.251]  And I mean, there's so many drivers that follow you.
[03:25:53.271 --> 03:25:56.053]  Yeah, what is it, Dr. Pucinich, about truck drivers?
[03:25:56.093 --> 03:25:59.576]  They seem to be not left or right, but just super-informed patriots.
[03:25:59.596 --> 03:26:00.357]  I'm not just saying that.
[03:26:00.717 --> 03:26:02.018]  Truck drivers out of any group.
[03:26:02.825 --> 03:26:04.766]  I've invested in a lot of truck drivers.
[03:26:04.826 --> 03:26:09.129]  Number one, believe it or not, the truck drivers are very independent.
[03:26:09.329 --> 03:26:20.056]  What they really do is they own their own trucks and what they depend on is a very sophisticated information system that tells them where to pick up the load, how much the load is,
[03:26:20.516 --> 03:26:21.656]  We're to take the load.
[03:26:21.757 --> 03:26:29.459]  So they are very sophisticated business people who know exactly what they need, what they want to do, and what it takes.
[03:26:29.559 --> 03:26:30.760]  So this is an example.
[03:26:30.820 --> 03:26:34.061]  This gentleman is a great example of why America's great.
[03:26:34.561 --> 03:26:37.242]  Trucks are moving everywhere over the United States.
[03:26:37.262 --> 03:26:38.543]  By the way, I knew what you were going to say.
[03:26:38.563 --> 03:26:43.164]  I remember like five years ago you said the truck driver is the archetype of America.
[03:26:43.704 --> 03:26:44.665]  I remember you saying that.
[03:26:45.265 --> 03:26:46.806]  That's correct, and I believe it.
[03:26:46.866 --> 03:26:51.469]  They have become the archetype of America because that's their independent freedom.
[03:26:51.889 --> 03:26:53.670]  They drive when they want to.
[03:26:53.690 --> 03:26:55.371]  They pick up the loads they want to.
[03:26:55.411 --> 03:26:56.532]  They know where to go.
[03:26:56.632 --> 03:27:00.694]  When they go over to another place a thousand miles away, they have another load.
[03:27:00.734 --> 03:27:01.635]  They bring it back.
[03:27:01.975 --> 03:27:03.296]  They know what the shipment is.
[03:27:03.356 --> 03:27:04.617]  They know how much it costs.
[03:27:04.937 --> 03:27:07.619]  You can't get more sophisticated than a truck driver.
[03:27:07.639 --> 03:27:09.219]  It's like a land-based merchant marine.
[03:27:09.420 --> 03:27:09.860]  It's an army.
[03:27:10.321 --> 03:27:10.641]  Got it.
[03:27:10.922 --> 03:27:11.884]  Exactly right.
[03:27:12.024 --> 03:27:15.532]  And they have to deal with sophisticated internet capacities.
[03:27:15.592 --> 03:27:18.518]  Now, do you think our politicians know anything about it?
[03:27:18.738 --> 03:27:18.839]  No.
[03:27:19.850 --> 03:27:23.834]  Basically, the truckers are the most amazing business people I've ever met.
[03:27:24.114 --> 03:27:27.698]  And by the way, they're the most courteous on the road and they're formidable.
[03:27:28.099 --> 03:27:29.780]  They're the ones who make the road go.
[03:27:29.800 --> 03:27:32.343]  Well, I was just asking why I've been on the air 23 years.
[03:27:32.363 --> 03:27:34.185]  It's the truckers of any group.
[03:27:34.445 --> 03:27:35.726]  We should make the show more about truckers.
[03:27:35.746 --> 03:27:36.828]  That's correct.
[03:27:36.848 --> 03:27:39.610]  They are the most active patriotic group.
[03:27:39.650 --> 03:27:40.111]  It's crazy.
[03:27:40.211 --> 03:27:40.832]  Other than veterans.
[03:27:41.789 --> 03:27:44.471]  Well, because they are like you and I. They're business people.
[03:27:44.911 --> 03:27:47.833]  If you haven't, you know, everybody says you've got to go to college.
[03:27:47.913 --> 03:27:49.134]  No, you don't have to go to college.
[03:27:49.154 --> 03:27:51.196]  You have to understand what it is that you can do.
[03:27:51.636 --> 03:27:54.778]  And if you're a trucker, you go to school, you learn how to drive the truck.
[03:27:54.818 --> 03:27:56.579]  It's a very sophisticated system.
[03:27:56.840 --> 03:27:58.901]  But at the same time, you take the risk.
[03:27:59.261 --> 03:28:00.162]  You take the load.
[03:28:00.222 --> 03:28:01.323]  You take the upside.
[03:28:01.363 --> 03:28:02.364]  You take the leverage.
[03:28:02.384 --> 03:28:03.184]  You know the gas.
[03:28:03.224 --> 03:28:04.065]  You know the wear out.
[03:28:04.365 --> 03:28:05.626]  You know the depreciation.
[03:28:05.666 --> 03:28:08.328]  You know the length of time that the truck can go in.
[03:28:08.388 --> 03:28:11.130]  And it's that process that's empowering to the individual.
[03:28:11.849 --> 03:28:14.970]  It's totally empowering, and it's empowering to our country.
[03:28:15.010 --> 03:28:17.571]  The more trucks we have, the more trade we have.
[03:28:17.631 --> 03:28:19.992]  And you can see it east, west, and north, south.
[03:28:20.392 --> 03:28:25.294]  I mean, I live right in the middle of Florida, and you see trucking going from Jacksonville to Gainesville.
[03:28:25.554 --> 03:28:26.434]  It's constant.
[03:28:26.715 --> 03:28:28.415]  And we're building more roads.
[03:28:28.495 --> 03:28:32.257]  So the infrastructure project is the next thing Trump is going to talk about.
[03:28:32.617 --> 03:28:33.777]  Who else is talking about it?
[03:28:33.937 --> 03:28:35.958]  I haven't heard a president talk about that yet.
[03:28:36.707 --> 03:28:40.191]  So, the tractor is the penultimate American entrepreneur.
[03:28:40.331 --> 03:28:41.713]  All right, God bless you, David.
[03:28:41.733 --> 03:28:47.199]  Listen, I said I wouldn't go any further, and Larry Klayman's coming up with breaking news with Joel Gilbert, but I've got to go to Nemo.
[03:28:47.519 --> 03:28:49.461]  When we come back, Tom Clancy died mysteriously.
[03:28:49.882 --> 03:28:53.406]  I don't know if that's true, but we know that, uh, we know that Stephen Shinnick was good friends with him.
[03:28:53.426 --> 03:28:56.429]  We'll find out about that real fast, and Joel Gilbert's taking over.
[03:28:56.449 --> 03:28:56.810]  Stay with us.
[03:28:59.651 --> 03:29:07.335]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:29:08.215 --> 03:29:12.257]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:29:12.777 --> 03:29:15.118]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:29:15.898 --> 03:29:19.020]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:29:20.529 --> 03:29:32.676]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:29:33.376 --> 03:29:48.425]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:29:49.426 --> 03:29:53.133]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for your family.
[03:29:53.695 --> 03:29:55.398]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:29:55.438 --> 03:29:57.683]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:30:00.959 --> 03:30:05.342]  William Benning joins us to go over this with us right now.
[03:30:05.422 --> 03:30:16.391]  But again, there's the amazing cover sheet by the White House lawyer for the president saying we're ready to release more and to work with Congress to expose the full extent.
[03:30:16.531 --> 03:30:18.132]  This is just the beginning.
[03:30:18.192 --> 03:30:21.815]  So, Mr. Benning, you had said last Tuesday you hope this was just the beginning.
[03:30:22.575 --> 03:30:38.224]  And that you have been told that this larger memo investigation by the FISA court was one of the prime areas tying in and a nexus point of a third party, the judicial branch, now documenting what the executive and the legislative have found.
[03:30:40.355 --> 03:31:01.643]  That's right and I think the more and more they go into it they're gonna find that the NSA is involved in this and that they need to look at what which names of people were unmasked through the NSA and which ones were targeted through their collection system and what what data they were using internally in the FBI and how they were using that data.
[03:31:02.432 --> 03:31:09.639]  That's really where criminality comes in, where you use these agencies against innocent or against U.S.
[03:31:09.680 --> 03:31:11.461]  citizens with no probable cause.
[03:31:12.362 --> 03:31:15.946]  That's a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment, and they shouldn't have been doing that anyway.
[03:31:16.006 --> 03:31:16.567]  They know that.
[03:31:16.947 --> 03:31:18.769]  That's why they're trying to keep everything so secret.
[03:31:18.869 --> 03:31:24.695]  The first place I'd start is to go after the sworn affidavit that the FBI had to submit to the FISA court to get that warrant.
[03:31:25.680 --> 03:31:34.269]  That, of course, according to the memo, seemed to focus on the dossier, the Steele dossier, and that that was a false basis to begin with, and they knew that.
[03:31:34.690 --> 03:31:38.294]  And they didn't even talk about the DNC paying to have that done.
[03:31:38.754 --> 03:31:43.920]  So this is paid propaganda used to get a warrant and defy support to go after other people in another campaign.
[03:31:44.961 --> 03:31:46.503]  And then it means you have to go into the
[03:31:47.103 --> 03:31:55.029]  And into the unmasking by the White House of people who were in the Trump campaign to find out who they were targeting and what data they were getting and how they were using it.
[03:31:55.069 --> 03:31:56.150]  This is really a mess.
[03:31:56.530 --> 03:32:02.995]  I mean, it gets into the total subversion and sedition, basically, and treason against this country.
[03:32:03.115 --> 03:32:04.576]  I think we're in the... this is the break.
[03:32:04.636 --> 03:32:12.522]  And I think this break now is opening up the real rottenness in our government in Washington and in the agencies that make it up.
[03:32:13.483 --> 03:32:18.844]  And so this is where this is where we really have to get to it and it goes beyond like the FBI is the front.
[03:32:19.265 --> 03:32:23.646]  They take the flack from everybody because they figure they'll still survive because we need the FBI.
[03:32:24.266 --> 03:32:39.870]  But behind them are the supporting agencies like NSA and NCIA and others who are actually helping them do and achieve what they want to do as a collective group of that I call them the Praetorian Guard who will determine what our government does.
[03:32:40.530 --> 03:32:43.031]  And so that's why they think they have so much power.
[03:32:43.071 --> 03:32:57.317]  Now we have to shine the light on them and show them out for what they've been doing and hold those people who did it in those agencies accountable and make sure we carry through all the law and apply all the law equally to all of them.
[03:33:03.460 --> 03:33:06.081]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.509 --> 03:33:22.693]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:24.215 --> 03:33:26.156]  Poets tell how Poncho fell.
[03:33:27.397 --> 03:33:30.060]  Poets tell how Poncho fell.
[03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:33.903]  He left his living in cheap hotels.
[03:33:34.964 --> 03:33:37.706]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[03:33:38.947 --> 03:33:41.589]  So the story ends, we're told.
[03:33:42.830 --> 03:33:45.212]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true.
[03:33:50.757 --> 03:33:55.539]  Never saw Merle Haggard in concert.
[03:33:55.679 --> 03:34:02.861]  I was buying tickets to see him in, like, Waco in a month when he died in South Texas.
[03:34:03.601 --> 03:34:05.542]  I think it was like Corpus Christi or something from pneumonia.
[03:34:06.423 --> 03:34:06.943]  Side issue.
[03:34:07.324 --> 03:34:08.404]  I apologize to Joel Gilbert.
[03:34:08.424 --> 03:34:17.931]  When he signed on to do Friday's One Hour, I told him occasionally I'd hijack it, but he's welcome to come on with Larry Klayman during the War Room or during the 34-hour broadcast that's going on, or in the last segment here in a few minutes.
[03:34:17.951 --> 03:34:21.814]  But I swore to go to these phone calls, so we're doing it right now.
[03:34:22.514 --> 03:34:23.435]  Thank you, David in Oklahoma.
[03:34:23.475 --> 03:34:24.255]  Appreciate your call.
[03:34:24.416 --> 03:34:31.520]  Nemo in Massachusetts, you're on the air with the co-author of many of Tom Clancy's books, Dr. Steve Pichetti.
[03:34:31.540 --> 03:34:31.781]  Go ahead.
[03:34:35.285 --> 03:34:36.506]  Okay, got your question Nemo?
[03:34:37.967 --> 03:34:38.748]  Got any other questions?
[03:34:39.068 --> 03:34:39.629]  Well, there you go.
[03:34:39.649 --> 03:34:42.411]  You had your question about Tom Clancy died mysteriously.
[03:34:42.451 --> 03:34:42.851]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:34:42.871 --> 03:34:43.271]  You're on the air.
[03:34:44.232 --> 03:34:45.273]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:34:45.313 --> 03:34:45.793]  Big fan.
[03:34:46.234 --> 03:34:49.356]  Yes, well, I haven't been able to get too many direct sources.
[03:34:49.416 --> 03:34:52.159]  I found out kind of late towards the end of the election that he died.
[03:34:52.179 --> 03:34:53.920]  Couldn't find any real coverage on it.
[03:34:53.960 --> 03:34:58.884]  Was asking if the doctor... It did get unusually low coverage for one of the best-selling authors in U.S.
[03:34:58.904 --> 03:34:59.304]  history.
[03:34:59.525 --> 03:34:59.785]  Go ahead.
[03:35:00.612 --> 03:35:01.152]  Absolutely.
[03:35:01.192 --> 03:35:05.614]  I think the main reason for that is he's essentially our first accepted leaker.
[03:35:05.694 --> 03:35:13.858]  You know, he taught the American people what really goes on with all those government dollars and all those programs, and truly a great American in my mind.
[03:35:14.838 --> 03:35:25.123]  But yeah, I only found out through, you know, following the rabbit hole of all the people who had died mysteriously, and yeah, couldn't find any real solid coverage.
[03:35:27.059 --> 03:35:28.981]  Well, one of his good friends was right here.
[03:35:29.421 --> 03:35:32.364]  Was there any hanky-panky or foul play or skullduggery?
[03:35:33.184 --> 03:35:33.404]  No.
[03:35:34.585 --> 03:35:39.910]  Tom was an unusually bright man, a very funny man, a very serious man when he had to write.
[03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:41.171]  We wrote together.
[03:35:41.191 --> 03:35:42.913]  We did a lot of things together.
[03:35:43.493 --> 03:35:47.677]  I can assure you he died a very dignified death, a very quiet death.
[03:35:47.777 --> 03:35:48.838]  I miss him very much.
[03:35:49.597 --> 03:35:56.283]  And the irony of all about Tom, although he wrote these brilliant books, was that he was one of the funniest men I had ever known.
[03:35:56.903 --> 03:36:03.769]  And he would always temper my laughter because I said, Tom, we really should be in the business of writing comedy and humor.
[03:36:03.829 --> 03:36:07.132]  And he said, no, no, no, no, that's much harder than you realize.
[03:36:07.192 --> 03:36:08.753]  So now we miss him.
[03:36:08.953 --> 03:36:12.957]  I can assure you he died a very dignified and honorable death.
[03:36:13.017 --> 03:36:16.640]  He's a great service to America and he was a great American.
[03:36:17.220 --> 03:36:18.281]  I thank you for the question.
[03:36:18.601 --> 03:36:19.962]  Any other questions, Demo?
[03:36:20.742 --> 03:36:27.686]  I would just like to say thank you to the doctor and that I'll spread that to those of us that are skeptics and seekers.
[03:36:28.526 --> 03:36:31.288]  And please keep continuing to do what you do.
[03:36:31.308 --> 03:36:34.810]  Sure, I don't want to give him his private life, but I mean, didn't he smoke a lot of cigarettes?
[03:36:36.407 --> 03:36:36.947]  Uh, yes.
[03:36:37.487 --> 03:36:40.848]  I didn't want to get into that, but he did smoke a lot of cigarettes.
[03:36:41.088 --> 03:36:45.249]  There's a little story I had to kind of sidebar.
[03:36:45.389 --> 03:36:53.451]  When we were in Hollywood together and we were doing the four-hour miniseries, I had to kind of hide some of the cigarettes.
[03:36:53.992 --> 03:36:55.012]  Was that Netforce?
[03:36:56.152 --> 03:36:56.272]  Huh?
[03:36:56.792 --> 03:36:57.452]  Was that Netforce?
[03:36:57.472 --> 03:36:58.053]  Boy, you're...
[03:36:59.994 --> 03:37:00.795]  That's amazing.
[03:37:00.855 --> 03:37:02.776]  Yes, that wasn't at first.
[03:37:02.796 --> 03:37:09.002]  And we kind of had a game and then he picked up a few cigarettes in one place and then another place.
[03:37:09.562 --> 03:37:12.244]  And I said, well, you missed a couple of points.
[03:37:12.425 --> 03:37:16.048]  And then in the car, he just picked up all the cigarettes he had.
[03:37:16.068 --> 03:37:18.990]  And it's the kind of habit you really can't break.
[03:37:19.070 --> 03:37:21.052]  But he was a wonderful partner.
[03:37:21.072 --> 03:37:22.873]  I really enjoyed having him.
[03:37:23.013 --> 03:37:24.615]  And he had a great sense of humor.
[03:37:25.215 --> 03:37:26.336]  A great American.
[03:37:26.376 --> 03:37:27.857]  He really loved this country.
[03:37:28.577 --> 03:37:31.639]  And when we worked together, it was just a great pleasure.
[03:37:31.659 --> 03:37:34.280]  But unfortunately, he didn't smoke a lot.
[03:37:34.841 --> 03:37:37.682]  I only started smoking in college when I would drink beer and stuff.
[03:37:37.822 --> 03:37:38.683]  And I didn't like it at first.
[03:37:38.723 --> 03:37:42.165]  And then all of a sudden, I caught myself about eight years ago, smoking a pack a day.
[03:37:42.185 --> 03:37:46.727]  And I went and my, like, three-year-old daughter grabbed the cigarettes and threw them in the trash.
[03:37:46.767 --> 03:37:47.088]  That was it.
[03:37:47.881 --> 03:37:49.261]  But, uh, yeah.
[03:37:49.441 --> 03:37:53.602]  If we can do any one thing, we have to warn our audience, please stop smoking.
[03:37:53.682 --> 03:37:56.783]  It really has a very deleterious effect on your body.
[03:37:56.823 --> 03:38:03.085]  When you come in the emergency room, we doctors know automatically, if you even tell us that you didn't smoke, we'll know that.
[03:38:03.505 --> 03:38:05.345]  And it has a deleterious effect.
[03:38:05.405 --> 03:38:08.746]  They put ammonia into the nicotine, so it's addictive.
[03:38:08.786 --> 03:38:09.926]  It's not just psychological.
[03:38:10.006 --> 03:38:11.947]  It's a bunch of chemicals they get away with the grandfather.
[03:38:11.967 --> 03:38:12.587]  That's a great point.
[03:38:13.359 --> 03:38:13.879]  That's correct.
[03:38:13.899 --> 03:38:15.120]  They put all sorts of crap in there.
[03:38:15.160 --> 03:38:15.881]  Nemo, thank you.
[03:38:16.141 --> 03:38:17.963]  Jeff in Canada, you're on there with Dr. Steve Pichanik.
[03:38:18.003 --> 03:38:18.283]  Go ahead.
[03:38:22.066 --> 03:38:22.746]  Hey, Alex, are you there?
[03:38:22.766 --> 03:38:23.367]  Yes, sir.
[03:38:24.668 --> 03:38:39.639]  Hey, um, I just, uh, I'm driving a truck up and down Vancouver Island today, and, uh, you sharing that segment earlier in the day about, uh, people getting chopped up and shot, and you broke my heart, man.
[03:38:39.719 --> 03:38:41.921]  I had to stop the truck and cry.
[03:38:42.895 --> 03:38:44.196]  Well, you ought to have to watch the footage.
[03:38:44.236 --> 03:38:55.545]  You know, I got tears in my eyes, and I made myself watch two hours of it in that office, of Al-Qaeda and ISIS chopping up people and making people eat it before they blew their heads off, lying little kids off and laughing when they shot little girls in the head.
[03:38:56.086 --> 03:38:58.768]  That's the kind of footage that's been removed off YouTube most people haven't seen.
[03:38:59.168 --> 03:39:01.150]  And that's the satanic behavior of the jihadis.
[03:39:01.170 --> 03:39:12.539]  I don't know how they get those people so whacked out, but I mean, it's like watching Charlie Manson cut up, you know, the lady he killed, but it's actually happening.
[03:39:13.561 --> 03:39:23.985]  You know, I just thank God for InfoWars and all the wonderful guests that you have on to be able to just bring that information that we'll never hear from MSM.
[03:39:24.946 --> 03:39:29.187]  And I just want to say, you know, I heard about the truck driver and the support.
[03:39:29.607 --> 03:39:35.390]  I just want to say from Canada, I want to just pledge to you today a hundred bucks.
[03:39:35.470 --> 03:39:43.193]  And I want to just, anybody with an earshot of wanting to be free, because there's an international movement against us.
[03:39:44.236 --> 03:39:45.878]  Freedom loving, God loving people.
[03:39:45.898 --> 03:39:56.549]  If you can hear this, support Alex, support the show, support the guests, because maybe you don't think you can afford $100, but if you can afford
[03:39:59.086 --> 03:40:02.947]  Well, I know this.
[03:40:02.967 --> 03:40:03.788]  I know this.
[03:40:03.948 --> 03:40:10.089]  I have so much faith in people that I'm super confident, but absolutely, I mean, we have the globalist after us.
[03:40:10.109 --> 03:40:15.330]  We have the worst people after us, and when you support us financially and get great products at the same time, it's seismic.
[03:40:15.390 --> 03:40:21.252]  That's why they hate free market, because free market, even if it's limited, gives people a manifestation of their will.
[03:40:21.852 --> 03:40:25.413]  If you read the Clinton Foundation documents, not the current one, but their law library,
[03:40:27.694 --> 03:40:31.938]  In, like, 1993, the documents came out that were, you know, from their first run for president.
[03:40:32.218 --> 03:40:38.685]  They were obsessed with not letting libertarians or nationalists or conservatives have a market, have books.
[03:40:38.725 --> 03:40:39.966]  They wanted books shut down.
[03:40:40.006 --> 03:40:41.527]  They wanted videos shut down.
[03:40:41.547 --> 03:40:43.169]  They wanted no economy for us.
[03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:44.771]  Well, they failed, didn't they, Dr. Puccini?
[03:40:46.158 --> 03:40:47.218]  They failed completely.
[03:40:47.419 --> 03:40:56.162]  Ironically, the man behind a lot of what happened in Arkansas was a man by the name of Sam Walton.
[03:40:56.763 --> 03:41:00.204]  If you look back at his history, he was in military intelligence.
[03:41:00.244 --> 03:41:01.825]  He was in fact in charge.
[03:41:05.108 --> 03:41:13.077]  And so what you had was an individual who already understood repression and suppression.
[03:41:13.517 --> 03:41:18.082]  As a result of that, he garnered a lot of money, I would say from China or elsewhere.
[03:41:18.582 --> 03:41:22.743]  And then propagated this notion through the Clintons and others.
[03:41:22.963 --> 03:41:36.648]  But it's a very dangerous collusion that occurred between World War II intelligence reports and people and the ongoing representatives of the state.
[03:41:36.988 --> 03:41:40.309]  And if you see the movie by Tom Cruise, American Made,
[03:41:42.827 --> 03:41:44.789]  I'm on a big Cruise fan, but it's an excellent movie.
[03:41:44.849 --> 03:41:45.069]  I saw it.
[03:41:45.089 --> 03:41:46.750]  Very historical, as you said.
[03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:47.551]  God bless you, Jeff.
[03:41:47.571 --> 03:41:47.771]  Thank you.
[03:41:59.901 --> 03:42:00.802]  Look, I'm out of time.
[03:42:00.862 --> 03:42:04.543]  I've already taken 45 minutes away from Joel Gilbert.
[03:42:04.583 --> 03:42:06.605]  I apologize to him, but he signed on to know this would happen.
[03:42:06.945 --> 03:42:10.647]  So he can pop back in later, but he's going to have to come up with... Larry Klaman always has great info.
[03:42:10.667 --> 03:42:16.250]  And then Ryan and Matt, I apologize, but we will be back, Lord willing, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:42:16.310 --> 03:42:20.012]  The 36-hour broadcast has three hours, four hours left in it right now.
[03:42:20.812 --> 03:42:22.873]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:42:22.953 --> 03:42:23.974]  Again, just spread those links.
[03:42:24.294 --> 03:42:25.374]  That's the biggest thing you can do.
[03:42:26.015 --> 03:42:27.295]  SteveBuchinick.com.
[03:42:27.315 --> 03:42:28.196]  20 seconds, final comment.
[03:42:29.841 --> 03:42:31.502]  I have full faith in you.
[03:42:31.522 --> 03:42:33.643]  I have full faith in the American public.
[03:42:33.843 --> 03:42:41.146]  I really appreciate the Trumpers of the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, and the Republic will survive and prosper.
[03:42:41.566 --> 03:42:42.886]  Be safe, and God bless.
[03:42:43.406 --> 03:42:44.147]  That's right, it's true.
[03:42:44.187 --> 03:42:48.568]  These are the death throes, and some of us that are the focus of the death throes will not make it.
[03:42:48.949 --> 03:42:50.089]  But don't take that as a defeat.
[03:42:50.229 --> 03:42:51.470]  We are going to win.
[03:42:52.210 --> 03:42:53.330]  Nothing is going to stop us.
[03:42:53.691 --> 03:42:55.291]  We can't let these globalists run our lives.
[03:42:55.871 --> 03:42:57.152]  All right, coming up, Joel Gilbert.
[03:42:59.218 --> 03:43:01.540]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.

[03:45:04.612 --> 03:45:07.274]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[03:45:07.354 --> 03:45:13.339]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[03:45:13.379 --> 03:45:15.701]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[03:45:15.861 --> 03:45:24.047]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[03:45:24.128 --> 03:45:27.010]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[03:45:27.430 --> 03:45:37.097]  An ad of me promoting BrainForce, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[03:45:37.197 --> 03:45:40.420]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.

[03:45:49.366 --> 03:45:51.428]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[03:45:51.468 --> 03:45:52.469]  It was hilarious.
[03:45:52.729 --> 03:45:52.949]  They...
[03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:56.791]  They wrote it at Vice.com!
[03:45:56.931 --> 03:46:06.734]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[03:46:06.754 --> 03:46:09.174]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[03:46:09.774 --> 03:46:16.196]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[03:46:16.796 --> 03:46:18.417]  You gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[03:46:19.600 --> 03:46:25.887]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brain Force.
[03:46:25.947 --> 03:46:28.090]  Well, here I'm making another one right now.
[03:46:28.430 --> 03:46:29.611]  Gonna get triggered over this?
[03:46:29.672 --> 03:46:29.932]  Good.
[03:46:30.172 --> 03:46:31.494]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[03:46:31.674 --> 03:46:36.379]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[03:46:36.679 --> 03:46:38.762]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[03:46:39.182 --> 03:46:41.544]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[03:46:41.884 --> 03:46:44.786]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[03:46:44.806 --> 03:46:46.348]  Get your BrainForce right now.
[03:46:46.428 --> 03:46:47.328]  BrainForce Plus.

[03:47:02.960 --> 03:47:05.622]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:26.955 --> 03:47:28.815]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.955 --> 03:47:32.177]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you right from the left coast.
[03:47:32.797 --> 03:47:34.278]  I'm going to be back at
[03:47:35.635 --> 03:47:40.157]  Six o'clock Eastern for a full hour with Larry Klayman, the attorney.
[03:47:40.177 --> 03:47:53.324]  We're going to talk about the Michael Cohn raid, the Robert Mueller persecution, the FBI mob boss, James Comey, all the corruption with the federal judges, as well as the Andrew McCabe report, which just dropped.
[03:47:53.384 --> 03:47:56.165]  So come on back for the War Room later on.
[03:47:57.676 --> 03:48:04.042]  Don't forget, of course, go to the Alex Jones store, see my new film right there, and purchase it to help the resistance.
[03:48:04.202 --> 03:48:06.083]  It's Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:48:06.103 --> 03:48:14.151]  Now I'm going to spend this segment talking about how important it was that Paul Ryan is leaving the House.
[03:48:14.271 --> 03:48:16.353]  I call it good riddance to Paul Ryan.
[03:48:17.434 --> 03:48:20.416]  Paul Ryan is old-school establishment.
[03:48:20.576 --> 03:48:21.998]  He was the Republican leader
[03:48:23.038 --> 03:48:30.581]  In the House during Obama's presidency and he didn't said almost nothing to stop Barack Obama's radical agenda.
[03:48:31.861 --> 03:48:36.122]  Does anyone remember Paul Ryan leading the fight against Obama's open borders?
[03:48:36.743 --> 03:48:44.325]  Does anyone remember Paul Ryan saying anything about the IRS targeting of conservatives and the interference in the 2012 election?
[03:48:44.725 --> 03:48:46.206]  The only reason we had DOJ
[03:48:47.265 --> 03:48:51.907]  And FBI interference in 2016 is because the IRS interfered in 2012.
[03:48:53.267 --> 03:48:55.808]  Paul Ryan and the Republicans did nothing.
[03:48:56.788 --> 03:48:59.209]  Paul Ryan was and is not a fighter.
[03:48:59.989 --> 03:49:02.330]  The Republican-based voters want fighters.
[03:49:02.510 --> 03:49:08.412]  So Paul Ryan was never a good fit for Speaker of the House where he got very little done.
[03:49:08.432 --> 03:49:14.895]  I want to play a video of Paul Ryan telling us why he's quitting the House.
[03:49:14.935 --> 03:49:15.735]  Let's play that video.
[03:49:16.383 --> 03:49:20.386]  That's why today I'm announcing that this year will be my last one as a member of the House.
[03:49:20.786 --> 03:49:30.312]  What I realize is, if I am here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad.
[03:49:30.773 --> 03:49:31.853]  I just can't let that happen.
[03:49:33.735 --> 03:49:36.056]  Okay, so let's tell the truth here.
[03:49:36.457 --> 03:49:41.240]  Paul Ryan did not resign because he wants to spend time with his teenage kids.
[03:49:41.760 --> 03:49:44.262]  Teenage kids are busy, they don't hang out with dad anyway.
[03:49:45.780 --> 03:49:48.341]  And it's not true that he's only been a weekend father.
[03:49:48.961 --> 03:49:54.683]  Congress is only scheduled to be in session about 130 days every year.
[03:49:55.523 --> 03:50:02.725]  So there's about 225 days with long vacations, winter, summer, spring, fall.
[03:50:03.785 --> 03:50:06.646]  So this is just a ridiculous excuse.
[03:50:07.566 --> 03:50:11.727]  Believe me, Paul Ryan's kids are very disappointed that their dad is resigning.
[03:50:12.507 --> 03:50:14.328]  They wish he would go back to Washington.
[03:50:15.089 --> 03:50:16.129]  They come to Washington.
[03:50:16.149 --> 03:50:17.070]  They have a great time.
[03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:25.693]  And these are the most famous kids in Wisconsin because their dad is the speaker 120 days out of a 365-day year.
[03:50:26.233 --> 03:50:29.354]  So, family time is always a generic excuse.
[03:50:29.434 --> 03:50:30.175]  Family time.
[03:50:31.095 --> 03:50:33.896]  For anyone who quits with a very big issue.
[03:50:34.856 --> 03:50:40.919]  So, before I tell you the truth about why Paul Ryan is quitting, let's go back a bit.
[03:50:40.979 --> 03:50:41.999]  Who is Paul Ryan?
[03:50:43.140 --> 03:50:49.804]  Well, the first thing people think of when they see Paul Ryan, they think, well, there's Herman Munster, all grown up.
[03:50:50.504 --> 03:50:53.566]  Herman Munster grew up and he ran for Congress.
[03:50:53.926 --> 03:50:55.047]  That's the first thing they think of.
[03:50:56.528 --> 03:51:01.110]  Now, Paul Ryan did nothing in his life before running for Congress.
[03:51:01.391 --> 03:51:02.591]  He came to Congress at age 28.
[03:51:04.514 --> 03:51:06.695]  Before that, he was an intern.
[03:51:07.075 --> 03:51:10.976]  Paul Ryan was just a congressional intern and then a legislative aide.
[03:51:11.356 --> 03:51:16.037]  So Paul Ryan was a child and is a child of the Washington swamp.
[03:51:17.097 --> 03:51:24.219]  And his alleged love and interest for tax and government reform was not original at all.
[03:51:24.259 --> 03:51:27.340]  It couldn't be because he had no experience in the private sector.
[03:51:28.340 --> 03:51:31.481]  Paul Ryan was a legislative aide for Jack Kemp.
[03:51:32.230 --> 03:51:35.411]  That's where he even got the idea of government reform.
[03:51:35.431 --> 03:51:36.612]  It was not even original.
[03:51:37.672 --> 03:51:44.435]  And again, Paul Ryan didn't do anything in his life before becoming a congressman at age 28.
[03:51:45.575 --> 03:51:51.398]  So you had Paul Ryan, unoriginal, inexperienced, never accomplished anything.
[03:51:52.338 --> 03:51:56.060]  And that's why Mitt Romney chose him for vice president.
[03:51:56.980 --> 03:51:58.781]  Mitt Romney, establishment guy,
[03:51:59.682 --> 03:52:04.545]  Chooses a Washington swamp guy, and that's why they lost.
[03:52:04.605 --> 03:52:07.827]  That's why they lost to Barack Obama, who was very beatable.
[03:52:08.487 --> 03:52:14.230]  Most unsuccessful pro-Russian first term in history of Barack Obama.
[03:52:14.290 --> 03:52:23.875]  Killed the economy, started race wars, you know, abuse of power, fast and furious, and they got two swamp creatures.
[03:52:26.207 --> 03:52:33.910]  Look, the only thing that Paul Ryan accomplished in Congress that he said was the goal of his entire life that he couldn't accomplish for 20 years was tax reform.
[03:52:34.750 --> 03:52:37.331]  And the only way he did it was because of Donald Trump.
[03:52:37.411 --> 03:52:40.592]  This is the guy that Paul Ryan did not even support for president.
[03:52:40.652 --> 03:52:45.494]  For 20 years, Paul Ryan does nothing, and then Trump comes in and gets it done.
[03:52:46.374 --> 03:52:50.296]  Let's remind ourselves of what Paul Ryan felt about Trump's agenda.
[03:52:50.336 --> 03:52:51.376]  Let's look at that video.
[03:52:56.553 --> 03:52:58.554]  Quote, Islam hates us.
[03:52:59.034 --> 03:53:01.755]  Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims?
[03:53:02.035 --> 03:53:02.956]  I mean a lot of them.
[03:53:03.276 --> 03:53:04.376]  I mean a lot of them.
[03:53:04.877 --> 03:53:09.859]  Normally, I do not comment on what's going on in the presidential election.
[03:53:09.939 --> 03:53:11.319]  I will take an exception today.
[03:53:11.500 --> 03:53:18.723]  Some of our best and biggest allies in this struggle and fight against radical Islamic terror are Muslims.
[03:53:19.423 --> 03:53:23.265]  The vast, vast, vast, vast majority of whom are peaceful.
[03:53:24.105 --> 03:53:27.266]  Who believe in pluralism, freedom, democracy.
[03:53:27.806 --> 03:53:36.488]  Donald Trump's plan to deport 11 million illegal immigrants could never pass Congress, according to the new Republican Speaker of the House.
[03:53:36.988 --> 03:53:43.549]  I think you can oppose the President on some issue that you fundamentally disagree with, but also work with the other party on issues you do agree with.
[03:53:45.550 --> 03:53:47.590]  So why is Ryan quitting Congress?
[03:53:48.450 --> 03:53:51.973]  Paul Ryan is going away because he can't stand Trump winning.
[03:53:52.453 --> 03:53:53.834]  He can't take the winning.
[03:53:53.894 --> 03:53:54.955]  It's too much winning.
[03:53:55.896 --> 03:53:59.559]  He can't stand it that he accomplished nothing and Trump came in and won.
[03:54:00.179 --> 03:54:08.366]  I want to show you a video excerpt from The Art of the Insult about what Trump said he would do in office and how he was going to win.
[03:54:08.386 --> 03:54:09.527]  Let's see that clip.
[03:54:11.869 --> 03:54:13.029]  We're going to win with health.
[03:54:13.109 --> 03:54:14.790]  We're going to win at so many levels.
[03:54:14.810 --> 03:54:17.371]  We're going to have to win, have to win, have to win.
[03:54:17.511 --> 03:54:22.972]  You're going to get so tired of winning and just say, please, please, it's too much winning.
[03:54:23.252 --> 03:54:24.653]  We can't take it anymore.
[03:54:24.933 --> 03:54:26.953]  Mr. President, it's too much.
[03:54:27.133 --> 03:54:29.014]  We can't take this much victory.
[03:54:29.374 --> 03:54:30.234]  Please stop.
[03:54:30.414 --> 03:54:31.655]  And I'll say, no, it isn't.
[03:54:31.955 --> 03:54:32.995]  We have to keep winning.
[03:54:33.275 --> 03:54:34.717]  We have to win more!
[03:54:34.798 --> 03:54:36.039]  We're gonna keep winning!
[03:54:36.059 --> 03:54:36.039]  100%!
[03:54:36.740 --> 03:54:39.084]  America first!
[03:54:39.144 --> 03:54:41.968]  We're gonna make our country great again!
[03:54:42.248 --> 03:54:43.069]  We're gonna win!
[03:54:43.450 --> 03:54:44.251]  We're gonna win!
[03:54:44.652 --> 03:54:46.114]  And we're going to win!
[03:54:48.115 --> 03:54:50.016]  Okay, so that's my take.
[03:54:50.216 --> 03:54:53.817]  For 20 years, Paul Ryan could not get anything done on tax reform.
[03:54:54.278 --> 03:54:56.999]  Here comes an outsider and he gets tax reform done.
[03:54:57.419 --> 03:54:59.400]  Paul Ryan cannot take the winning.
[03:54:59.640 --> 03:55:00.840]  He doesn't like the winning.
[03:55:01.020 --> 03:55:02.341]  It makes him feel bad.
[03:55:03.241 --> 03:55:04.522]  Paul Ryan is not a winner.
[03:55:05.482 --> 03:55:08.864]  He's afraid that Trump will win even more and make him look even worse.
[03:55:11.185 --> 03:55:17.007]  Paul Ryan, as Trump would say, Paul Ryan wants to go home to Wisconsin and go to sleep.
[03:55:18.201 --> 03:55:27.163]  I think Paul Ryan needs to step down now, not in January, and allow a strong conservative like Jim Jordan to lead the Republicans into the midterms.
[03:55:27.623 --> 03:55:30.383]  So, I'm going to say good riddance to Paul Ryan.
[03:55:30.803 --> 03:55:34.224]  He represents everything we never needed in a leader.
[03:55:34.784 --> 03:55:35.644]  He's not a fighter.
[03:55:36.364 --> 03:55:44.826]  All he wanted to do was placate the establishment because he is and always will be an establishment swamp creature since he was 28 years old.
[03:55:46.068 --> 03:55:47.289]  That's my take on Paul Ryan.
[03:55:47.849 --> 03:55:53.253]  Now the FBI and DOJ just released the McCabe Report.
[03:55:53.654 --> 03:55:59.838]  We're going to be speaking for a full hour with Attorney Larry Klayman coming up at 6 o'clock Eastern.
[03:56:00.378 --> 03:56:05.382]  We're also going to look at all the DOJ corruption, the raid on Attorney
[03:56:06.312 --> 03:56:07.132]  Michael Cohen.
[03:56:07.753 --> 03:56:15.757]  A lot of people are saying that that raid on Michael Cohen's office, Donald Trump's attorney, was essentially opposition research.
[03:56:16.277 --> 03:56:20.059]  They're going to grab everything they can and start leaking it to the press.
[03:56:20.359 --> 03:56:24.181]  And they'll use all of that information to build up to the midterms.
[03:56:24.221 --> 03:56:25.421]  They'll leak it out slowly.
[03:56:25.981 --> 03:56:27.762]  Trump paid off this person.
[03:56:27.862 --> 03:56:29.323]  His lawyer paid off that person.
[03:56:29.783 --> 03:56:35.406]  Already, Elliot Broidy, the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee,
[03:56:36.644 --> 03:56:38.225]  Elliot Broidy, big Trump supporter.
[03:56:39.746 --> 03:56:41.347]  What a coincidence.
[03:56:41.807 --> 03:56:53.192]  24, 48 hours after the raid on Michael Cohen's offices, we find out that Michael Cohen represented Elliot Broidy in paying some hush money to a Playboy Playmate.
[03:56:53.732 --> 03:56:54.693]  What a coincidence.
[03:56:55.293 --> 03:57:02.737]  So, I think we're going to see them leak this information slowly and use it against Trump and the Republicans.
[03:57:04.640 --> 03:57:06.243]  The DOJ is out of control.
[03:57:06.563 --> 03:57:10.129]  The Robert Mueller persecution is out of control.
[03:57:10.790 --> 03:57:16.199]  Attorney Larry Klayman can be joining us to go through all these issues and talk about what Trump can and should do.
[03:57:18.503 --> 03:57:22.224]  Again, it's going to be at 6 o'clock Eastern, 3 o'clock Pacific.
[03:57:23.425 --> 03:57:28.146]  Don't forget to go to Alex Jones Store for Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:57:28.446 --> 03:57:30.747]  You won't stop laughing for 95 minutes.
[03:57:31.447 --> 03:57:32.907]  You've got to buy it from Alex Jones.
[03:57:33.187 --> 03:57:35.168]  You'll understand Trump for the very first time.
[03:57:35.768 --> 03:57:38.029]  Again, I'm Joel Gilbert, right from the left coast.
