[00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.872]  Another time, in the Age of Wonder.
[00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:46.369]  Why is Infowars under such attack?
[00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:52.894]  Why is it demonized so much by corporate media, by the Republican establishment, by the Democrat establishment, by foreign governments?
[00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:54.436]  What is it we're covering?
[00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.392]  Well, it's that there's a breakaway civilization.
[00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:00.533]  That's not just a statement, it's true.
[00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:06.977]  Of the military-industrial complex controlled by a technological elite.
[00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:11.240]  Those are quotes from President Eisenhower in his farewell address in 1961.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:22.926]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:01:23.407 --> 00:01:25.708]  Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry
[00:01:26.497 --> 00:01:39.026]  ...can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.
[00:01:40.647 --> 00:01:50.354]  Akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial military posture has been the technological revolution during recent decades.
[00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:54.877]  In this revolution, research has become central.
[00:01:56.059 --> 00:02:00.063]  It also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly.
[00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:06.568]  For every old blackboard, there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.
[00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.877]  The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present.
[00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:19.793]  And is gravely to be regarded.
[00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:26.118]  A technological elite of eugenicists, that was the big craze up until the end of World War II.
[00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:29.241]  They went underground into the U.S.
[00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:33.184]  DARPA development system.
[00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:35.046]  Most of them were pro-Hitler.
[00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:36.707]  The others were pro-communist.
[00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:41.111]  They all believed in command and control, centralization by elites because they're the elites.
[00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:53.265]  And they've now established much of a world government that's based on austerity and based on racial division and based on balkanization and based on divide and conquer.
[00:02:55.307 --> 00:03:04.355]  And so we are coming at it from a position of it's unelected, it's unaccountable, it's corrupt.
[00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:08.266]  He doesn't have your interest in mind.
[00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:10.267]  It's very, very evil.
[00:03:11.287 --> 00:03:12.888]  We should say no to this.
[00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:15.709]  And people around the world are starting to say no to it.
[00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.590]  People around the world are starting to understand this.
[00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:31.755]  And instead of just being tribal about a football team, or a baseball team, or even your church, which isn't about Christ, but about the community of the church and most of these things, they're just social clubs.
[00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:33.156]  What about
[00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:43.432]  The human ethos of renaissance and controlling your own destiny and being free that God really tried to build and give you a chance at.
[00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:45.713]  What about that first understanding of free will?
[00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:57.116]  And globalism is about a worldwide social credit score, a mark of the beast, where if you don't behave and do what they say, you're basically blocked off from society.
[00:03:57.457 --> 00:03:58.317]  You can starve to death.
[00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:03.684]  You try to live out in the country like the Amish or something, here come the armored vehicles because they say you're a cult.
[00:04:04.184 --> 00:04:05.325]  This is manifesting.
[00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:06.766]  This is happening.
[00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:15.251]  This is the big issue that we face as a civilization and as a society right now.
[00:04:18.473 --> 00:04:23.636]  So, that's why they're trying to shut us down.
[00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:44.252]  Is because you can talk about left-wing or right-wing, you can debate fascism versus anti-fascism, you can debate all this window dressing and all the deck chairs and furniture and silverware and cutlery and plates and china and the food being delivered onto the deck of the Titanic right as it hits that iceberg.
[00:04:45.512 --> 00:04:46.513]  But you've hit the iceberg.
[00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:49.814]  And so the question is, what are you going to do about it?
[00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:56.753]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:04:57.014 --> 00:05:02.247]  You've now been completely banned from every major platform, and they're moving against thousands of others an hour.
[00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:11.264]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:12.565]  And I want to thank you all.
[00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:13.626]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.407]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:21.752]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[00:05:21.992 --> 00:05:24.134]  And we've got products that help you.
[00:05:24.154 --> 00:05:27.116]  I mean, even mainstream media admits they have to, that fish roe is the best thing ever.
[00:05:27.316 --> 00:05:28.517]  But you want pure fish oil.
[00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:29.999]  You want the mercury removed.
[00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.402]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[00:05:32.562 --> 00:05:33.303]  The best krill oil.
[00:05:33.383 --> 00:05:36.005]  The best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic.
[00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:39.529]  Salmon and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids.
[00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.470]  The honor roll.
[00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.111]  Three different types.
[00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:42.072]  You cannot do better.
[00:05:42.132 --> 00:05:42.713]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:42.973 --> 00:05:43.534]  Help the brain.
[00:05:43.574 --> 00:05:44.014]  Help the body.
[00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:44.475]  Help the heart.
[00:05:44.515 --> 00:05:45.095]  Help the info war.
[00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:45.776]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[00:05:45.976 --> 00:05:49.281]  And then we've got Ultimate Tumor Formula about to sell out bodies at 50% off.
[00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:51.304]  Bone broth, I'm about to cut that special this week.
[00:05:51.404 --> 00:05:53.206]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:53.306 --> 00:05:58.994]  I really appreciate you standing with us, but we need massive capital infusions so I can energize to take on Soros and Hillary.
[00:05:59.315 --> 00:05:59.735]  I need it!
[00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:25.741]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:27.223 --> 00:06:36.590]  Well, my friends, just 60 days ahead of this historic midterm election, Twitter completely banned me for bullying
[00:06:37.771 --> 00:06:40.393]  ...and aggressive behavior in Congress.
[00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:45.676]  George Soros literally owns much of the big telecom stock, the big tech stock.
[00:06:45.997 --> 00:06:49.939]  He's openly pushing for censorship of myself and thousands of others, which has now happened.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.943]  He's been caught through his foundations paying people cash to go in and disrupt the meetings and get arrested.
[00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:05.169]  I went in, had a press conference, totally dominated, ran into Oliver Darcy of CNN.
[00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:14.892]  Who admittedly runs the operations interfacing with Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it, to censor myself and thousands of other conservatives.
[00:07:15.552 --> 00:07:18.474]  Who writes articles calling for them to blacklist me and ban me.
[00:07:18.694 --> 00:07:20.516]  Who is a thought police general.
[00:07:22.277 --> 00:07:35.226]  I confront this monster, public figure, a man, and they go and tattle and say he bullied me and the Antifa supporting
[00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:54.279]  Twitter, that's banning thousands of conservatives a day, everyone you know has basically been banned, comes out and says we've banned Alex Jones for being a bully, and then they've got quotes in the Associated Press by members of Congress.
[00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:55.961]  New Jersey Democrat Rep.
[00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:59.845]  Frank Pallone praised Twitter's action in a tweet.
[00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:06.220]  Glad Twitter's taking steps to put an end to the abusive behavior from Alex Jones and Infowars, the tweet said.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:16.129]  Tweets designed to threaten, belittle, demean, and silence individuals have no place on this platform.
[00:08:18.071 --> 00:08:19.532]  They are silencing me.
[00:08:20.192 --> 00:08:21.834]  They are calling me a white supremacist.
[00:08:21.874 --> 00:08:23.816]  They are demonizing this country.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.249]  They're saying, get rid of the American flag, and then they turn around and bully us, and bully you, and then say, take him off.
[00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:34.652]  He wants to silence people.
[00:08:38.894 --> 00:08:40.836]  It's the left banning free speech on universities.
[00:08:40.896 --> 00:08:44.299]  It's the left doing brainwashing, diversity training on all the big corporations.
[00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:48.162]  It's the left and Nike pushing Kaepernick and force-feeding that garbage.
[00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:52.586]  But the good news is, America is rejecting it across the board.
[00:08:53.027 --> 00:08:55.228]  White, black, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn't matter.
[00:08:55.288 --> 00:08:56.429]  People are seeing through it.
[00:08:57.611 --> 00:09:00.053]  And all the polls and all the numbers and all the facts show that.
[00:09:00.353 --> 00:09:01.774]  The NFL's going straight down.
[00:09:02.114 --> 00:09:03.256]  Nike's going straight down.
[00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:04.677]  Hollywood's going straight down.
[00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:20.134]  These big tech corporations' stock is starting to go down because people understand just 60 days out that Google and Facebook and Twitter all over the world are blocking nationalists and patriots.
[00:09:20.595 --> 00:09:34.803]  And the man in the front running who said in his translation from Spanish and Portuguese and Brazil to Brazil first?
[00:09:35.874 --> 00:09:37.395]  And God over everything.
[00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:45.443]  We've got video coming up of him getting brutally stabbed yesterday while he was being carried on the shoulders of a crowd.
[00:09:48.065 --> 00:09:48.926]  And they stabbed him.
[00:09:50.768 --> 00:09:53.470]  And then the left and the media and this country and Brazil celebrated it.
[00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.531]  Stabbed him in the liver.
[00:09:55.572 --> 00:09:57.774]  Stabbed him in the lungs.
[00:09:58.615 --> 00:09:59.856]  And stabbed him in the kidneys.
[00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:00.977]  Vicious.
[00:10:01.037 --> 00:10:02.098]  He's fighting for his life.
[00:10:04.662 --> 00:10:05.102]  Right now.
[00:10:05.943 --> 00:10:10.605]  Brazil's far-right candidate in serious condition.
[00:10:12.066 --> 00:10:13.166]  There's your violence.
[00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:14.647]  That's what's going on.
[00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:15.867]  And pray for him.
[00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:19.089]  Pray for him to survive.
[00:10:19.109 --> 00:10:21.070]  We'll get more into that coming up.
[00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:27.173]  But this is what they're trying to ban, ladies and gentlemen, are people standing up to these globalists.
[00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.915]  And there's a real photo taken in the committee hearing where I'm in the front row.
[00:10:33.277 --> 00:10:33.857]  Right behind.
[00:10:35.098 --> 00:10:35.518]  Darcy.
[00:10:36.859 --> 00:10:37.659]  And the media spun it.
[00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:39.500]  Oh, Jones tried to attack Darcy.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.860]  Or Jack Dorsey.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.281]  He bullied him.
[00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.102]  The media's all chasing him out.
[00:10:45.462 --> 00:10:46.863]  First they said, oh, he's already outside.
[00:10:46.883 --> 00:10:47.763]  Everybody runs outside.
[00:10:47.803 --> 00:10:49.504]  I said, I got a feeling he's actually still in here.
[00:10:49.564 --> 00:10:49.844]  Boom.
[00:10:49.904 --> 00:10:50.464]  He comes out.
[00:10:51.225 --> 00:10:53.806]  And I say, Jack, I hope you really do support the First Amendment.
[00:10:53.866 --> 00:10:55.046]  Thanks for saying you do.
[00:10:55.587 --> 00:11:00.849]  But when you put that fake strike on me, I'd never threaten to use battle rifles on the media.
[00:11:02.148 --> 00:11:04.129]  So see, everything they've done has been a fraud.
[00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:08.731]  And all they were doing was legitimizing getting rid of InfoWars.
[00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:15.234]  Because Twitter is the worst right now at purging people in MASH.
[00:11:17.915 --> 00:11:18.635]  That's what's going on.
[00:11:18.675 --> 00:11:21.036]  So I promise Jack Dorsey and everybody else this.
[00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:30.521]  We are going to be visiting with you.
[00:11:31.656 --> 00:11:38.344]  We are going to be coming to your events, your conferences, we're going to have demonstrations, I'm going to be coming to the committee hearings, and I'm going to be in the third dimension.
[00:11:38.944 --> 00:11:44.771]  We are going to invade with information and with love and with justice, bringing the truth.
[00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:52.579]  And we're going to be exposing Big Tech and their interference in the election, their violation of Federal Elections Commission laws.
[00:11:53.697 --> 00:12:05.339]  There are civil rights violations of conservatives and Christians en masse and the organized persecution that we have in your internal documents, that we have thanks to Project Veritas undercover videos, and that we've experienced.
[00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:06.899]  Look at DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.240]  Media briefed ahead of time.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:19.862]  At the exact minute, BuzzFeed, CNN, AP, and others all published lengthy articles
[00:12:22.008 --> 00:12:26.253]  That I had been banned with their official story en masse that I was a bully.
[00:12:26.293 --> 00:12:27.414]  They didn't say who I bullied.
[00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:36.425]  But later, Oliver Darcy of CNN and BuzzFeed, writers all bragged how they had engineered it.
[00:12:39.068 --> 00:12:40.931]  So, there they are, coordinating
[00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:54.866]  The entire thing and bragging about it in your face, how they coordinate to bully me and deplatform me and call me a white supremacist and stalk me and lie about me and going around and harass our sponsors and all of this.
[00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:05.857]  And then turn around and say that I did to them what they did to me because like a man, I dared stand up to them.
[00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:07.409]  There you see it.
[00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:07.409]  347.
[00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.711]  When did Twitter announce it?
[00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:09.711]  347.
[00:13:10.452 --> 00:13:12.453]  When did AP announce it?
[00:13:12.473 --> 00:13:12.453]  346.
[00:13:12.974 --> 00:13:16.356]  They jumped the gun.
[00:13:17.938 --> 00:13:18.999]  They jumped the gun.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.821]  Look at that coordination.
[00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:22.361]  BuzzFeed. 345.
[00:13:24.614 --> 00:13:29.878]  Look at the criminal coordination of the New York Times, the Washington Post, all of them together.
[00:13:30.058 --> 00:13:30.839]  I didn't get told.
[00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:31.700]  I never got a call.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.480]  I never got an email.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.601]  Because I'm a slave.
[00:13:33.681 --> 00:13:34.282]  I'm a nobody.
[00:13:34.342 --> 00:13:35.042]  I'm dog meat.
[00:13:35.222 --> 00:13:36.524]  I'm one of those Americans.
[00:13:37.765 --> 00:13:39.026]  I'm an effing white male.
[00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:44.170]  You've got the real alpha males, the real alpha males, posing as little liberals.
[00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.310]  Oh, we're so sweet.
[00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:45.991]  Oh, we're so nice.
[00:13:46.011 --> 00:13:48.193]  But they're the savage killers of free speech.
[00:13:49.468 --> 00:13:54.150]  And they're the ones creating race war in this country to control all of us and play us off against each other.
[00:13:54.230 --> 00:14:02.735]  But, AP was the assassin of truth in their article, but in the minute and a half clip they ran in the same story of my press conference, they got it right.
[00:14:02.855 --> 00:14:03.335]  And here it is.
[00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:05.331]  Not here.
[00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:30.585]  To begin shutting down conservatives when the Democrats threatened to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:37.148]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you cannot violate people's free speech.
[00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:42.291]  So I want regulations like the First Amendment to be enforced to say you're not going to violate people's free speech.
[00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:44.333]  You're not going to be able to shut people down like this.
[00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:46.714]  And I'm also here to be able to face my accusers.
[00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.335]  This is the 11th hearing they've had.
[00:14:48.915 --> 00:14:52.738]  Where they make up all these incredible lies about me and others to sell the end of the First Amendment.
[00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:56.341]  It's happening to everybody now who's a libertarian or conservative.
[00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:57.602]  The dominoes are falling.
[00:14:57.782 --> 00:14:59.143]  The First Amendment's being destroyed.
[00:14:59.343 --> 00:15:03.246]  But I think the corporate dying dinosaur media has bit off more than it can chew.
[00:15:03.706 --> 00:15:08.150]  And what you've done is only going to make people be that much stronger and fight for free speech that much more.
[00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:09.070]  I'll say this.
[00:15:09.331 --> 00:15:11.552]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media.
[00:15:11.872 --> 00:15:22.179]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[00:15:22.219 --> 00:15:26.682]  These big monopolies need to be broken up, and these are digital commons.
[00:15:26.722 --> 00:15:36.949]  They've said in their own words and under federal law, and they shouldn't be in there controlling what individuals are saying in those private discussions and in those discussions online, if it's not criminal what's being said and what's being done.
[00:15:38.311 --> 00:15:40.593]  So there you go, that's why they're trying to shut us down.
[00:15:40.653 --> 00:15:43.214]  That's what I really said, and I was effective.
[00:15:44.335 --> 00:15:48.278]  And they're saying I bullied Marco Rubio when he came over to where we were with our cameras.
[00:15:48.738 --> 00:15:56.603]  They're saying that I bullied the CNN operative who is the true racketeer, by the very definition of thought police Gestapo.
[00:15:57.764 --> 00:16:01.266]  No, no, these criminals don't want to be confronted, because that's what they are.
[00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:06.670]  I'm here in the Infowars bunker, and I'm coming to you from one of our new studios.
[00:16:08.345 --> 00:16:13.469]  We've gained hundreds of new affiliates last month, but my God, Soros and the Communist Chinese are coming down on us hard.
[00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:19.013]  And you know, I see Google and Facebook and Apple especially moving to China and helping suppress their people.
[00:16:20.274 --> 00:16:20.854]  It freaks me out.
[00:16:21.715 --> 00:16:24.857]  Because China has killed five times the number of people that Adolf Hitler did.
[00:16:25.838 --> 00:16:30.601]  But oh, because they're Chinese, it's okay, because media taught us only white people can do bad stuff.
[00:16:31.762 --> 00:16:32.383]  It freaks me out.
[00:16:33.402 --> 00:16:37.569]  To see all these big tech companies saying, let's just ban Trump supporters, period.
[00:16:37.849 --> 00:16:39.532]  Let's ban all Alex Jones supporters.
[00:16:40.393 --> 00:16:41.695]  They're putting us in a digital gulag.
[00:16:41.735 --> 00:16:45.141]  But the good news is, humanity is fighting back.
[00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:47.204]  And that's why I'm coming to you from this new studio.
[00:16:48.433 --> 00:16:53.954]  That we're building is one of the most state-of-the-art in the country to transmit the truth worldwide to the people.
[00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:55.835]  We've got big plans.
[00:16:56.435 --> 00:17:01.556]  That's why I'm asking all of you, however you can support or whatever you can do, we are all in this together.
[00:17:01.916 --> 00:17:02.957]  Look at this studio.
[00:17:03.377 --> 00:17:04.277]  Look at what we're doing.
[00:17:04.597 --> 00:17:05.657]  Look at the crew we're hiring.
[00:17:05.957 --> 00:17:07.238]  Look at all the things that are happening.
[00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:08.178]  It's epic.
[00:17:09.518 --> 00:17:11.719]  And then, take these products right here.
[00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.031]  We have the best fish oil for adults and children.
[00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:19.892]  We have the best CoQ10 and PQQ.
[00:17:19.932 --> 00:17:22.653]  They're the best bone broth, it's all there.
[00:17:23.614 --> 00:17:28.615]  You get these products, you get things that help you and your body and your family, and they help fund the information war.
[00:17:28.916 --> 00:17:30.256]  And these sales are gonna end this week.
[00:17:31.236 --> 00:17:32.957]  So I commend you, I salute you, I thank you.
[00:17:32.977 --> 00:17:36.118]  But take advantage of these sales right now, some of the biggest ever.
[00:17:36.838 --> 00:17:38.639]  50% off on many of these products.
[00:17:38.999 --> 00:17:40.820]  Free shipping on many of the items, you name it.
[00:17:41.755 --> 00:17:42.796]  And we'll be able to move forward.
[00:17:43.716 --> 00:17:46.658]  Quite frankly, it's crazy how this stuff works.
[00:17:46.718 --> 00:17:50.521]  Because every attack they launch, you bring in just enough support to counter it.
[00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.022]  Then they attack again, just enough support.
[00:17:53.543 --> 00:17:58.346]  You know, the Patriot in me wants to see us way up here to feel confident, but that's not how God works.
[00:17:59.126 --> 00:18:03.809]  It's you that keep hanging with us, and making the decision to support us, that as they double down, you double down.
[00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.091]  As they attack, you move back against them.
[00:18:07.369 --> 00:18:08.309]  It's an amazing time.
[00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.310]  The products are great.
[00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.371]  The t-shirts are great.
[00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:11.071]  The books are great.
[00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:12.011]  All the material is great.
[00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:13.232]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:13.512 --> 00:18:18.134]  Without you, we're not going to be able to launch this and counter these jerks.
[00:18:18.795 --> 00:18:22.717]  Without you, they're going to use us as the template, the blueprint, to shut all of you down.
[00:18:23.632 --> 00:18:35.503]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, I want to commend you for what you've done, and I want to encourage you now, more than ever, to think about what you're doing in history, and the fact that you've already committed so much to freedom, you've already seen so many good things happen.
[00:18:36.124 --> 00:18:39.867]  Now's the time to double down against these jerks, the New York Times, and CNN.
[00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:47.649]  And the jerks over at the Washington Post, and the Chi-Com murderers, and the scum in Hollywood, we're standing against them and we're delivering.
[00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.970]  And the economy's coming back, and people are coming together, but they're counter-striking.
[00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.671]  And without you standing with us, we will be shut down.
[00:18:56.431 --> 00:19:04.893]  They want to demoralize you, they want to tell you you're weak, they want to say we're losing in the face of this attack, because they want you to think your support didn't do jack squat.
[00:19:05.953 --> 00:19:09.099]  Your support has taken us to the most traffic InfoWars has ever gotten.
[00:19:09.621 --> 00:19:11.184]  And it's brought in the most money we've ever gotten.
[00:19:12.286 --> 00:19:12.987]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:19:14.013 --> 00:19:16.554]  Until they banned us, we were losing money for six, seven months.
[00:19:17.294 --> 00:19:20.415]  Because people thought everything was fine, and you know, Trump was there, and everything was okay.
[00:19:21.255 --> 00:19:23.516]  And so we're still behind for the year, what we need to expand.
[00:19:23.956 --> 00:19:24.836]  We might even contract.
[00:19:25.276 --> 00:19:30.738]  But with current numbers, it looks like we're gonna be able to launch the expansion, and the satellites, and everything, thanks to you!
[00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.499]  But it's up to you right now!
[00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:36.360]  My fighting spirit's never been stronger, because I can feel the enemy's about to bring it.
[00:19:37.423 --> 00:19:38.043]  To their next level.
[00:19:38.063 --> 00:19:39.745]  But we're gonna bring it to our next level as well.
[00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:42.707]  So I'm counting on you right now and I love you and I appreciate you.
[00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:48.050]  So whatever you do, however you do it, legally and lawfully, get the word out and support InfoWars.
[00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:50.012]  It's symbiotic, it supports you as well.
[00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:51.353]  I thank you again.
[00:19:51.373 --> 00:19:55.215]  This is quite an epic time of your life.
[00:19:55.235 --> 00:19:56.977]  60 days out from the election right now.
[00:19:58.798 --> 00:19:59.779]  History's happening right now.
[00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.440]  What are you gonna do right now?
[00:20:06.417 --> 00:20:09.179]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:15.423]  We've got it.
[00:20:15.623 --> 00:20:21.367]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:20:21.448 --> 00:20:23.549]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:25.811 --> 00:20:31.434]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:21:13.422 --> 00:21:34.517]  Alright folks, I'm gonna get more into the total attack that's taking place on the First Amendment in this country and the organized criminal corporate media that as a racketeering wall is focused and is integrated towards setting the stage to ban all their competition.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:37.860]  Now,
[00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:42.000]  This is all being done because the midterms are here.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.821]  It's all being done because they know the American people have woken up.
[00:21:45.421 --> 00:21:50.564]  This is all being done because we have true authoritarianism coming to this country.
[00:21:51.624 --> 00:21:53.465]  So it's a lot bigger than Infowars.com.
[00:21:54.066 --> 00:21:59.488]  Everyone I know is being either shadow banned or totally banned off of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.
[00:21:59.848 --> 00:22:01.789]  And that's over 90% of the internet.
[00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:05.431]  Google has delisted anything pro-Trump.
[00:22:07.017 --> 00:22:11.079]  It is just getting more and more and more intense by the minute.
[00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:18.721]  Which shows that these authoritarians will basically do anything and are going for broke.
[00:22:19.282 --> 00:22:31.146]  And I have personally, behind the scenes, been experiencing all of this.
[00:22:32.026 --> 00:22:33.907]  And it's mind-blowing.
[00:22:36.124 --> 00:22:37.405]  Now, think about InfoWars.
[00:22:37.425 --> 00:22:51.430]  We've got hundreds of radio affiliates, hundreds of TV affiliates, and we're still able to reach a lot of people and our information ends up getting out there on these platforms one way or the other.
[00:22:57.313 --> 00:23:04.696]  But for the average person that just had a popular Facebook page or Twitter that they spent years promoting,
[00:23:05.598 --> 00:23:12.644]  And maybe they have a local radio show or maybe they're formally a city council member or they're just a business person.
[00:23:13.224 --> 00:23:16.787]  Being banned from this is like being put in solitary confinement.
[00:23:17.168 --> 00:23:18.609]  And the companies know that.
[00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:31.620]  So it's very abusive socially and it's being done to politically control people and make examples of people so others submit so they won't be blacklisted from the global social score that's being brought into place.
[00:23:33.922 --> 00:23:43.409]  Now, we were the first to report on this global social score five years ago, but now Facebook and Twitter and Google admit they're doing it, and they're allied with China.
[00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:54.117]  And Jack Dorsey and all of them would sit up there and talk about how concerned they are about China, while they're doing it here in America, and Google wouldn't even show up.
[00:23:55.678 --> 00:23:57.239]  Google won't even work with the U.S.
[00:23:57.259 --> 00:23:59.441]  military now, even though it was founded by DARPA.
[00:24:00.101 --> 00:24:02.143]  They won't even, but they'll work with the Chinese military.
[00:24:05.609 --> 00:24:11.233]  So these are globalists allied against America, and our own government hasn't even figured it out yet.
[00:24:11.753 --> 00:24:12.774]  Trump's figured it out.
[00:24:13.234 --> 00:24:13.995]  I've figured it out.
[00:24:14.415 --> 00:24:15.176]  You've figured it out.
[00:24:18.298 --> 00:24:23.201]  Now, Paul Watson's put out a new hot report on this that we're going to cover when we come back in the next segment.
[00:24:23.401 --> 00:24:26.823]  Then Drew, one of our great camera folks, stayed an extra day in D.C.
[00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:32.667]  He caught some amazing things when he was there that you haven't seen yet.
[00:24:32.687 --> 00:24:34.389]  We'll exclusively play that next segment.
[00:24:35.424 --> 00:24:38.346]  But I just briefly want to talk to you about a couple of key issues here.
[00:24:39.206 --> 00:24:39.806]  And that's this.
[00:24:41.047 --> 00:24:43.268]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear.
[00:24:43.308 --> 00:24:44.549]  Everybody says they're the tip of the spear.
[00:24:45.229 --> 00:24:46.410]  And if you're on the ground, you are.
[00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.052]  And the listeners aren't just important, they're critical.
[00:24:50.372 --> 00:24:51.332]  Because you're the activist.
[00:24:51.853 --> 00:24:53.453]  You're what's unstoppable in the third dimension.
[00:24:55.394 --> 00:24:58.016]  And we've got to fight harder in the silicon dimension.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:05.486]  We've also got to fight harder in the third dimension, and that means InfoWarsArmy.com.
[00:25:06.748 --> 00:25:13.415]  Owen Schroer's idea to get the activists out there doing legal and lawful things, stunts, unfurling banners at sporting events, you name it.
[00:25:16.656 --> 00:25:24.822]  It's absolutely critical, and then we'll air those videos, we'll air that audio, we'll show those photos here, and then it will spread across the internet.
[00:25:24.842 --> 00:25:26.002]  So we're going to up our game.
[00:25:26.283 --> 00:25:27.544]  What you saw me do in D.C.
[00:25:27.964 --> 00:25:28.884]  was just step one.
[00:25:29.425 --> 00:25:34.168]  I predicted in the car, leaving the Senate and House hearings, that I would be banned within days.
[00:25:34.508 --> 00:25:34.869]  It happened.
[00:25:35.969 --> 00:25:36.730]  So did the rest of the crew.
[00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.652]  They said they're going to hit us for bullying.
[00:25:42.614 --> 00:25:54.619]  Oliver Darcy, the man behind getting us de-platformed and lying about us and organizing with mainstream media to brigade and go out and have us taken off the air.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.920]  He brags he led brigades.
[00:25:57.561 --> 00:25:58.401]  So do these other guys.
[00:25:58.441 --> 00:26:07.225]  These are arrogant, horrible, Grimer, Wormtongue, Gollum-like Judas Iscariot creatures.
[00:26:08.612 --> 00:26:16.038]  But for InfoWars to maintain its attack profile against the enemy, and to really go into this strong, why they fear us, is your strength.
[00:26:17.059 --> 00:26:18.320]  If you simply do one thing.
[00:26:20.102 --> 00:26:21.443]  If you simply, every day.
[00:26:22.813 --> 00:26:31.097]  Print up some cards or whatever and tell people at the grocery store, at the racetrack, you know, at church, at work, wherever.
[00:26:31.137 --> 00:26:34.559]  Hey, you've probably heard about Alex Jones and why he's being demonized everywhere.
[00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:37.900]  People are asking, why is this guy demonized almost as much as Trump?
[00:26:38.381 --> 00:26:39.541]  What is it he's really saying?
[00:26:39.621 --> 00:26:41.882]  You might want to go see it and watch it.
[00:26:42.123 --> 00:26:44.884]  He's been banned everywhere but his own platform.
[00:26:47.765 --> 00:26:50.647]  And like the Alamo, with his crew,
[00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:56.851]  He's making a stand to get the word out against overwhelming odds.
[00:26:56.931 --> 00:26:58.932]  But thanks to you, we're going to win.
[00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:02.392]  Because the information we're talking about is cutting edge.
[00:27:03.273 --> 00:27:10.694]  About the shycoms, the globalists, the sellout, the Democrats planning to end the First Amendment, their plans to bring in authoritarianism, their plans to federalize elections.
[00:27:11.034 --> 00:27:12.054]  This is all happening.
[00:27:12.154 --> 00:27:14.735]  The AI control, the censorship, it's here.
[00:27:15.695 --> 00:27:16.575]  They're making their move.
[00:27:17.556 --> 00:27:18.536]  Trump just got a beachhead.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.444]  If you will tell people about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:27:25.486 --> 00:27:33.073]  If you will tell people about Infowars.com forward slash show with the free podcast, one click to your device, you subscribe right to us, remove the middleman, it's free.
[00:27:34.074 --> 00:27:36.396]  Or you can find the live audio feeds, the live video feeds.
[00:27:37.142 --> 00:27:51.827]  But if you simply tell people, hey, go to Infowars.com forward slash show and find the verboten information, and then tell them, if you find it compelling and research it and find out it's true like I did, pass it on.
[00:27:53.007 --> 00:27:57.609]  That's how we have this underground network to defeat them like we did in 2016.
[00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:59.570]  We've made them show their hand now.
[00:28:00.575 --> 00:28:09.703]  We've made them come out and openly restrict speech, we've made them show the tyrants they are, and people are really waking up, and so now's the time to move the ball up the field.
[00:28:10.283 --> 00:28:12.485]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:28:13.786 --> 00:28:20.932]  And it's important to subscribe directly to the podcast, listen how you want, when you want, and find the free audio feeds and the video feeds and all the rest of it.
[00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:29.681]  Because it's only a matter of time, I think, till they kill the Android and the Apple app that are both number one in news worldwide.
[00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:31.684]  So they just delisted it when it hit number one.
[00:28:32.245 --> 00:28:33.968]  We launched the app like a week before they banned us.
[00:28:34.649 --> 00:28:38.495]  And then it got millions of downloads per platform, which is number one, and so they just then...
[00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:39.455]  It's delisted.
[00:28:39.515 --> 00:28:40.116]  It's still there.
[00:28:40.136 --> 00:28:41.316]  You gotta hand search it.
[00:28:41.536 --> 00:28:43.777]  Or go to Infowars.com forward slash app.
[00:28:44.177 --> 00:28:45.538]  Or Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:28:45.578 --> 00:28:46.158]  It's also there.
[00:28:47.618 --> 00:28:48.119]  This is it.
[00:28:48.179 --> 00:28:49.779]  This is authoritarianism come to America.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.080]  We're facing it down.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:51.900]  They're the censors.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.560]  They're the bullies.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:53.281]  They're the monsters.
[00:28:53.581 --> 00:28:56.822]  They're colluding together to defrock us of our freedom of speech.
[00:28:57.262 --> 00:29:00.103]  And then they turn around and call us bullies that are silencing people.
[00:29:00.303 --> 00:29:01.344]  They're true liars.
[00:29:02.751 --> 00:29:06.414]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[00:29:06.715 --> 00:29:10.138]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[00:29:10.498 --> 00:29:20.027]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[00:29:20.527 --> 00:29:20.907]  Study.
[00:29:21.207 --> 00:29:23.949]  This formula is 24 ppm.
[00:29:24.309 --> 00:29:26.090]  That's 32 ppm version.
[00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.271]  Is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:31.692]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[00:29:31.952 --> 00:29:36.575]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[00:29:36.595 --> 00:29:37.215]  Ah, you don't want that.
[00:29:37.555 --> 00:29:39.817]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:29:39.837 --> 00:29:40.217]  Go ahead.
[00:30:05.253 --> 00:30:07.414]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:30:07.434 --> 00:30:10.436]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:12.397]  It just gets old, man.
[00:30:12.697 --> 00:30:14.418]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:17.200]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.462]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:30:21.482 --> 00:30:23.944]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:30:24.764 --> 00:30:27.086]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:30:27.106 --> 00:30:28.566]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:30:28.807 --> 00:30:29.687]  Us being shut down?
[00:30:29.927 --> 00:30:30.968]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:30:31.388 --> 00:30:32.428]  You know what, Alex?
[00:30:32.468 --> 00:30:33.549]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:30:33.569 --> 00:30:34.409]  Hey, Frank!
[00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:40.031]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:30:40.331 --> 00:30:44.613]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:30:44.853 --> 00:30:47.714]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:30:47.734 --> 00:30:48.374]  Do you understand?
[00:30:48.454 --> 00:30:49.714]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:30:50.094 --> 00:30:51.255]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:57.157]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:30:58.117 --> 00:30:58.777]  Do you understand?
[00:30:58.797 --> 00:30:59.998]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.934]  He's made it more popular, I think, to be openly racist.
[00:31:07.094 --> 00:31:12.218]  Because this president, I will quote Steve Schmitt, is a stone-cold racist.
[00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:14.420]  They must be really hitting this tone hard right now.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.321]  That's the talking point.
[00:31:15.361 --> 00:31:15.801]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:18.383]  So this is the... Trump just signed a thing that will save millions of people!
[00:31:18.643 --> 00:31:19.644]  RACIST!
[00:31:20.165 --> 00:31:21.065]  The economy's coming back!
[00:31:21.325 --> 00:31:22.466]  RACIST!
[00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:25.969]  All the numbers say the Republicans are going to win Congress in the midterms!
[00:31:26.129 --> 00:31:27.090]  RACIST!
[00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:31.273]  Oh my god, the giant blue wave, now a red wave, the historic Trump's dominating!
[00:31:32.995 --> 00:31:33.535]  Oh my gosh!
[00:31:33.555 --> 00:31:37.978]  The Obama administration is being exposed for all the illegal activity and the abuse of power!
[00:31:38.018 --> 00:31:39.418]  It must be racist!
[00:31:39.699 --> 00:31:42.260]  MSRT can't torture little girls to death for Satan!
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.460]  Racist!
[00:31:43.541 --> 00:31:47.382]  You said Valerie Jarrett looks like the central casting for Planet of the Apes!
[00:31:47.463 --> 00:31:47.963]  Racist!
[00:31:48.203 --> 00:31:59.229]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:32:02.304 --> 00:32:05.725]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:06.245 --> 00:32:09.006]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:09.526 --> 00:32:15.348]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:15.808 --> 00:32:18.569]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:22.751]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:23.131 --> 00:32:29.194]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:29.594 --> 00:32:34.557]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:35.307 --> 00:32:38.709]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:39.249 --> 00:32:45.793]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:46.433 --> 00:32:51.135]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:51.676 --> 00:32:56.758]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:57.359 --> 00:33:01.321]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:06.423 --> 00:33:09.126]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:15.512]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:16.353 --> 00:33:18.695]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.121 --> 00:33:35.162]  It finally happened.
[00:33:35.362 --> 00:33:45.971]  I was suspended by Twitter for posting a video in which... confronted CNN reporter... which resulted in... being banned altogether.
[00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:53.357]  Wait, who is... and who is... I can't tell you, otherwise I'll be...
[00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:57.157]  But there's no social media bias against conservatives.
[00:33:57.377 --> 00:33:57.877]  Honest!
[00:33:58.077 --> 00:34:04.220]  I mean, if you literally tweet about how you want to murder the president, you'll not only retain your account, you'll get verified.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:10.683]  If you tweet racist bile about how you want white people to die, you'll not only retain your account, you'll get verified.
[00:34:10.723 --> 00:34:13.324]  But there's no social media bias against conservatives.
[00:34:13.424 --> 00:34:15.645]  Terror group Hamas still has an account.
[00:34:15.965 --> 00:34:19.347]  Jew-hating gay basher Louis Farrakhan still has an account.
[00:34:19.387 --> 00:34:23.509]  The people who threatened to kill Mike Cernovich's baby still have accounts.
[00:34:23.549 --> 00:34:28.412]  This verified Media Matters reporter who threatened violence still has an account.
[00:34:28.432 --> 00:34:33.834]  The actor who called for putting Barron Trump in a cage with paedophiles still has an account.
[00:34:33.854 --> 00:34:40.718]  But there's no social media bias against conservatives, so **** was banned for targeted harassment against ****.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:49.286]  But CNN reporters can literally show up at an old lady's house, harass and dox her, but that's not targeted harassment.
[00:34:49.306 --> 00:34:55.251]  The daughter of President Trump's received a slew of online abuse after American news network CNN publicly shamed her.
[00:34:55.291 --> 00:34:59.975]  Goldfarb was viciously attacked online after the short interview spread like wildfire.
[00:34:59.995 --> 00:35:07.141]  CNN reporters can intimidate and threaten to dox a private citizen over a meme, but that's not targeted harassment.
[00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:08.002]  Because as we know,
[00:35:08.382 --> 00:35:10.824]  There's no social media bias against conservatives.
[00:35:10.924 --> 00:35:11.444]  CNN.
[00:35:11.684 --> 00:35:13.705]  Trump is trying to shut down the media.
[00:35:13.865 --> 00:35:14.746]  Also CNN.
[00:35:14.906 --> 00:35:17.448]  Lobbies big tech to shut down the media.
[00:35:17.508 --> 00:35:22.931]  Now I'm sure the fact that Twitter and... ...tweeted at the exact same time about...
[00:35:24.295 --> 00:35:25.917]  Man, it's just a coincidence.
[00:35:25.977 --> 00:35:43.059]  And I'm sure that BuzzFeed tweeting about it at 4.45, AP at 4.46, then New York Times, followed by the Washington Post and Politico, almost like they were all tipped off by Twitter beforehand, after this BuzzFeed writer lobbied to get **** banned, while Fox News didn't get the memo that ****.
[00:35:44.301 --> 00:35:47.984]  ...was about to be banned, is all just one big coincidence.
[00:35:48.084 --> 00:35:59.092]  There's no collusion between Big Tech and corporate media outlets that want to shut down their competition, because as we all know, there's no social media bias against conservatives.
[00:35:59.172 --> 00:36:09.840]  And the fact that this all happened the day after Big Tech leaders testified in front of Congress, so Jack Dorsey wouldn't have to face questions about this, is also just a coincidence.
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.902]  Because as we know, there's no social media bias against conservatives.
[00:36:12.982 --> 00:36:13.543]  But Paul,
[00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:15.764]  My private company!
[00:36:16.064 --> 00:36:17.504]  Oh, shut the fuck up.
[00:36:17.744 --> 00:36:20.845]  Social media is the new public square.
[00:36:21.085 --> 00:36:22.646]  They're colluding with lawmakers.
[00:36:22.846 --> 00:36:26.947]  They're colluding with corporate media giants to silence dissidents.
[00:36:27.207 --> 00:36:30.348]  I'm done with your excuses and intellectual cowardice.
[00:36:30.448 --> 00:36:32.469]  I'm done with your glib myopia.
[00:36:32.509 --> 00:36:32.749]  This.
[00:36:33.169 --> 00:36:44.435]  If you don't think 20 SJWs working at Twitter or Facebook getting to decide who has free speech is a problem, then I'm done with you.
[00:36:44.595 --> 00:36:47.096]  Sign the petition in the description.
[00:36:47.156 --> 00:36:49.417]  I'm gonna ride it until the wheels fall off.
[00:36:49.537 --> 00:36:53.019]  You can ban us all, but at least what we did in the moment.
[00:36:53.459 --> 00:36:53.919]  mattered.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.363]  At least we were part of a movement that will reverberate throughout history.
[00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.604]  And you can't censor that.
[00:37:00.844 --> 00:37:06.008]  You can silence individuals, but you can never silence ideas.
[00:37:10.251 --> 00:37:12.693]  Please click the big red button to subscribe.
[00:37:12.733 --> 00:37:14.394]  It really helps me when you do that.
[00:37:14.454 --> 00:37:18.417]  And click the bell to allow notifications so you never miss a new video.
[00:37:19.304 --> 00:37:23.992]  And that's Paul Watson still on YouTube, but of course they shadow ban him, even though he has millions of subscribers.
[00:37:24.941 --> 00:37:26.502]  Most people don't get to see the video.
[00:37:26.522 --> 00:37:28.003]  You have to go to the page itself.
[00:37:28.604 --> 00:37:42.853]  But more and more, we're launching our own players, our own live feeds, our own apps, and our own push notifications that are going to start this weekend, where you don't just get a push notification when David Knight goes live, or I go live, or Owen Schroer goes live three times a day.
[00:37:43.433 --> 00:37:54.561]  All the little special times I go live at home, or I go live here at the office, or I go live on the road, that will now push to here at InfoWars.com and to the
[00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:57.041]  Apple and Android apps.
[00:37:57.101 --> 00:38:05.503]  But even if they ban those, it'll push right to the front page of Infowars.com with an article that pops up with the video.
[00:38:08.444 --> 00:38:13.645]  So again, this is just forcing us to innovate as we are thrown off of all those other platforms.
[00:38:13.905 --> 00:38:14.605]  But I want to be clear.
[00:38:15.685 --> 00:38:19.906]  We have the bulk of our audience on AM, FM, radio, and TV.
[00:38:20.976 --> 00:38:25.880]  It's just that in the modern age, you don't think of that as an audience, because people just passively listen.
[00:38:26.561 --> 00:38:35.588]  We think of the internet as the only audience that is out there, so I have the Washington Times, the New York Times, all trying to call me saying, what are you going to do now that you're not on the air?
[00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.111]  It's like saying, what's Rush Limbaugh going to do?
[00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:42.914]  He has a very small web presence, but he's one of the biggest shows in the world.
[00:38:43.495 --> 00:38:44.275]  Or George Norie.
[00:38:45.016 --> 00:38:45.837]  Or Michael Savage.
[00:38:45.957 --> 00:38:46.918]  It's crazy.
[00:38:47.694 --> 00:39:02.935]  And they hate DrugsReport.com because they want to censor all libertarians, all patriots, all nationalists off the air, but there he is with more traffic than CNN, The New York Times, and Facebook when it comes to news combined.
[00:39:03.857 --> 00:39:06.057]  And they don't know what to do and they can't stand it.
[00:39:06.097 --> 00:39:19.840]  So again, I want to thank DrudgeReport.com and Matt Drudge, who starting yesterday when we got banned at about 4.30 had us as the top story, right up there with the frontrunner Donald Trump of Brazil being stabbed and critically injured by a leftist.
[00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:22.621]  Now let's move down to the middle column.
[00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:24.621]  Twitter bans Alex Jones for life.
[00:39:25.161 --> 00:39:26.342]  They want to shut us up.
[00:39:27.842 --> 00:39:30.443]  Media briefed ahead of blacklisting.
[00:39:30.483 --> 00:39:32.323]  Well, the media actually coordinated it.
[00:39:35.307 --> 00:39:41.850]  That's what mainstream media does now, is they coordinate the censorship of conservatives and nationalists and patriots.
[00:39:43.050 --> 00:40:01.298]  And then, coming up in the next segment, I'm back there in the coffee room, getting a glass of water, back there in the break room, and everybody's shaking their head, watching Fox News.
[00:40:02.579 --> 00:40:04.500]  We've got different TVs on in different areas of the office.
[00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:06.637]  We don't watch CNN while we eat.
[00:40:06.677 --> 00:40:07.518]  That would make us nauseous.
[00:40:07.598 --> 00:40:08.558]  It's on in the hallway.
[00:40:09.079 --> 00:40:12.882]  MSNBC is on in the outhouse.
[00:40:13.682 --> 00:40:14.323]  We live in Texas.
[00:40:14.363 --> 00:40:15.344]  We don't have running water here.
[00:40:15.364 --> 00:40:16.564]  Or even electricity.
[00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:18.126]  Only the New Yorkers have that.
[00:40:18.446 --> 00:40:21.088]  Out in the outhouse we have MSNBC.
[00:40:21.348 --> 00:40:22.109]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:40:22.689 --> 00:40:23.269]  But seriously.
[00:40:24.266 --> 00:40:31.889]  It was Obama taking credit for the 4.6% growth rate when he said it would never go to 3% because Trump didn't have a magic wand.
[00:40:32.189 --> 00:40:39.811]  When it's 100% Trump and the American people believing in the country again and announcing that America is open for business, that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:40:40.111 --> 00:40:45.973]  Speaking of America being open for business, InfoWars is now a referendum on Americana.
[00:40:46.013 --> 00:40:47.354]  They see us as Americana.
[00:40:48.474 --> 00:40:50.235]  They see us as the spirit of America.
[00:40:50.255 --> 00:40:53.596]  I was very honored when Matt Drudge, years ago before I even met him, said,
[00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:59.712]  In an interview, Alex Jones is a beautiful piece of Americana that's still left.
[00:41:00.212 --> 00:41:00.732]  And you know what?
[00:41:00.892 --> 00:41:01.652]  I am Americana.
[00:41:01.692 --> 00:41:02.353]  So is Matt Drudge.
[00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:02.833]  So are you.
[00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:05.854]  This audience are a bunch of activist Americanists.
[00:41:06.974 --> 00:41:08.375]  Americana maximus.
[00:41:08.895 --> 00:41:18.658]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young, you are Americana when you love liberty, when you love freedom, when you're a rugged individualist, when you believe in self-defense, when you believe in God, or when you believe people's right to not believe in God.
[00:41:19.499 --> 00:41:22.900]  When you believe in not running somebody else's life, you are Americana and I salute you.
[00:41:23.988 --> 00:41:25.849]  And that's why it's now a fight.
[00:41:26.749 --> 00:41:34.513]  It's now part of the leftist religion to stalk me and demonize me and to attack me and I'm willing to do it for America.
[00:41:34.533 --> 00:41:37.774]  I've already seen the country come back from the dead and so it's worth it.
[00:41:38.895 --> 00:41:42.917]  It'd be really depressing if we weren't winning on so many fronts and then I was still being destroyed.
[00:41:43.557 --> 00:41:45.138]  But it would still be the right thing to do.
[00:41:47.782 --> 00:41:51.444]  So yes, believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.
[00:41:52.024 --> 00:42:00.848]  I'm not comparing myself to the military like Kaepernick does, but this is an information war, and they have come after my family and a lot of other things, and they are trying to set me up right now.
[00:42:00.868 --> 00:42:04.210]  Lawyers don't want me to get into that yet, but I'm going to get into it very, very soon.
[00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.871]  It's just things have gotten insane.
[00:42:07.912 --> 00:42:09.152]  Things are very, very dangerous.
[00:42:09.172 --> 00:42:10.553]  They're very, very critical right now.
[00:42:10.933 --> 00:42:16.256]  And in closing, if you will just financially support InfoWars and continue to do it,
[00:42:17.762 --> 00:42:21.004]  We are basically, barring them killing me, unbreakable, thanks to you.
[00:42:21.024 --> 00:42:26.427]  And we've got products you need, extended Labor Day special, 50% off many of our best-selling items.
[00:42:26.827 --> 00:42:29.508]  It's got to end with BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:42:30.128 --> 00:42:33.150]  Amazing, what is it, 95% curcuminoid level.
[00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:37.632]  Nobody else has got that because we're selling out of it.
[00:42:37.672 --> 00:42:39.113]  Everybody knows how great turmeric is.
[00:42:39.153 --> 00:42:40.194]  This is the best formula.
[00:42:41.269 --> 00:42:43.952]  Other leading brands are twice, three times as much, aren't even as good.
[00:42:44.392 --> 00:42:49.298]  Infowarslife.com, the bone broth, ultimate bone broth formula that's so amazing for your body.
[00:42:50.018 --> 00:42:50.299]  That is $19.95.
[00:42:50.419 --> 00:42:52.801]  Leading competitors are $60, aren't even as good.
[00:42:53.102 --> 00:42:53.883]  That's about to end.
[00:42:54.203 --> 00:42:57.607]  Bunch of other specials on BrainForceX2 and Infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:57.627 --> 00:42:59.088]  It's critical to fund us.
[00:42:59.108 --> 00:42:59.408]  Thank you.
[00:43:02.939 --> 00:43:06.201]  Alex Jones was quite the spectacle today.
[00:43:06.241 --> 00:43:14.786]  The most relevant part of this so far has been an interaction that Marco Rubio had while talking to reporters with Alex Jones.
[00:43:15.006 --> 00:43:20.048]  You know, look, part of this I think you could argue and say, why are you guys giving them any attention for this nonsense?
[00:43:20.088 --> 00:43:22.010]  But I think there's a point to this that's important.
[00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.490]  Here is this sort of spectacle.
[00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:28.233]  Marco Rubio is doing an interview and Alex Jones bumbles up to him.
[00:43:28.373 --> 00:43:34.376]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones' InfoWars right here in the hallway.
[00:43:34.576 --> 00:43:40.980]  I think Facebook now, I think it's important for them not to comply with any efforts to sort of go after freedom of expression.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.781]  What about the Democrats purging conservatives?
[00:43:42.881 --> 00:43:43.882]  She's not answering.
[00:43:44.862 --> 00:43:46.683]  Just that the Republicans are acting like it isn't happening.
[00:43:47.063 --> 00:43:47.824]  Thank God Trump is.
[00:43:48.604 --> 00:43:49.065]  It's weird.
[00:43:49.565 --> 00:43:50.245]  Oh, yeah, it's really weird.
[00:43:50.285 --> 00:43:51.406]  There's no purge of conservatives.
[00:43:51.466 --> 00:43:52.526]  There's no shadow banning.
[00:43:52.967 --> 00:43:55.368]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[00:43:55.868 --> 00:43:58.730]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.531]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:06.174]  Everybody should be... There's a... Look, I support going after... Is that a heckler?
[00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:06.874]  Is that a press?
[00:44:07.995 --> 00:44:08.635]  Look at this guy.
[00:44:08.675 --> 00:44:10.776]  He's saying that I don't exist.
[00:44:10.836 --> 00:44:12.076]  I just don't know who you are, man.
[00:44:12.136 --> 00:44:13.297]  I don't read who you're upside.
[00:44:13.357 --> 00:44:13.657]  Sure.
[00:44:13.737 --> 00:44:15.798]  And they demonize me in these fair hearings.
[00:44:15.998 --> 00:44:16.858]  And then he plays dumb.
[00:44:16.938 --> 00:44:18.499]  InfoWars.com, you know what it is.
[00:44:18.519 --> 00:44:21.840]  Does Google, does Facebook, does Twitter, do they need to be regulated?
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.020]  Do they need to be regulated?
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:23.901]  Who are you?
[00:44:23.941 --> 00:44:26.882]  I swear to God, I don't know who you are, man.
[00:44:34.045 --> 00:44:34.645]  InfoWars!
[00:44:34.686 --> 00:44:36.588]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[00:44:36.628 --> 00:44:37.829]  He's playing this joke over here.
[00:44:37.869 --> 00:44:40.312]  That's why the platforming didn't work.
[00:44:40.352 --> 00:44:41.594]  Here's the question.
[00:44:41.614 --> 00:44:42.615]  Don't touch me again.
[00:44:42.695 --> 00:44:44.377]  I'm asking you not to touch me.
[00:44:44.457 --> 00:44:48.281]  I know, but I don't want to be... You want me to get arrested?
[00:44:48.382 --> 00:44:50.264]  It's not just enough to take my birth permit?
[00:44:50.644 --> 00:44:51.826]  Oh, he'll beat me up.
[00:44:51.886 --> 00:44:53.668]  I know I am, but he's so mad.
[00:44:54.088 --> 00:44:56.050]  You're not going to silence me.
[00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.111]  You're not going to silence me right now.
[00:44:58.131 --> 00:45:00.553]  You are literally like a little gangster thug.
[00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:03.215]  Rubio just threatened to physically take care of me.
[00:45:03.296 --> 00:45:03.916]  Look at that.
[00:45:03.936 --> 00:45:06.898]  We are getting our first amendment.
[00:45:06.918 --> 00:45:12.263]  He tells you China's the problem, which it is, but they're taking our free speech right now.
[00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:13.163]  There goes Rubio.
[00:45:13.484 --> 00:45:18.748]  Do you believe that these platforms need to be regulated like a public utility and how do you go about doing that?
[00:45:19.068 --> 00:45:20.329]  Well, I prefer not to.
[00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:21.869]  For a competition, take care of that.
[00:45:21.889 --> 00:45:28.211]  But obviously, we're going to watch closely to make sure that these tools that are being used... I mean, one thing is to say we're going to go after foreign interference, design, and so on and so forth.
[00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:29.272]  But it's already going on here.
[00:45:29.332 --> 00:45:30.952]  Another thing is to say we're going to go after free speech.
[00:45:30.992 --> 00:45:32.173]  The Democrats are raping the Republicans.
[00:45:32.193 --> 00:45:34.334]  Because at some point, someone has to make a determination.
[00:45:34.434 --> 00:45:40.136]  What's the difference between, you know, misinformation from abroad and differences of opinion within the United States?
[00:45:40.156 --> 00:45:40.876]  Yeah, and that's happening here.
[00:45:40.896 --> 00:45:43.277]  It's a very fine line, and that's something we need to be careful about.
[00:45:43.297 --> 00:45:44.457]  We don't overreach in that direction.
[00:45:44.497 --> 00:45:46.098]  But then he doesn't know about InfoWars being banned.
[00:45:46.658 --> 00:45:48.019]  He doesn't know about the top news story in the country.
[00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:50.380]  I wonder why Rubio got so mad at me and threatened me physically.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:50.940]  Poor Rubio.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.921]  Look at this little frat boy.
[00:45:51.941 --> 00:45:52.201]  So cool.
[00:45:52.221 --> 00:45:52.942]  Back to your bath house.
[00:46:15.145 --> 00:46:16.466]  Compromise at the bathhouses.
[00:46:16.486 --> 00:46:18.628]  There goes Rubio, a little punk.
[00:46:18.868 --> 00:46:19.328]  Unbelievable.
[00:46:19.348 --> 00:46:21.149]  So, I mean, a couple things on that.
[00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:28.994]  First of all, how on earth can this maniac get that close to Marco Rubio for that long?
[00:46:29.134 --> 00:46:30.275]  I don't like Rubio.
[00:46:30.335 --> 00:46:31.516]  I don't agree with his politics.
[00:46:31.556 --> 00:46:35.298]  But with that said, when he said, I'm not going to arrest you, I'm going to handle it myself.
[00:46:36.179 --> 00:46:36.339]  Ha.
[00:46:36.499 --> 00:46:37.320]  And you're not going to get arrested.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.380]  I'll take care of it myself.
[00:46:38.961 --> 00:46:39.141]  Ha.
[00:46:39.621 --> 00:46:40.722]  OK, go ahead.
[00:46:43.243 --> 00:46:50.084]  There's got to be some sort of security there that's stopping him from actually... I mean, look, he should... He's a member of the press.
[00:46:50.644 --> 00:46:52.125]  He's insane.
[00:46:52.225 --> 00:46:53.865]  He is insane.
[00:46:53.925 --> 00:46:58.766]  He is an absolute security risk.
[00:47:06.447 --> 00:47:09.068]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:21.154]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:47:21.714 --> 00:47:23.216]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:26.658 --> 00:47:28.120]  You are a senator.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.641]  You could become president one day.
[00:47:29.721 --> 00:47:31.082]  You have to talk to everybody.
[00:47:31.623 --> 00:47:34.145]  Just go ahead and answer him to be gentlemanly.
[00:47:35.328 --> 00:47:38.850]  Uh, he, he, he, yeah, Rubio was very fake about it.
[00:47:39.151 --> 00:47:44.254]  Yeah, he, there you go, that, you could tell that was just, he was faking for the camera.
[00:47:44.374 --> 00:47:45.194]  I didn't like it.
[00:47:45.414 --> 00:47:45.715]  Yeah.
[00:47:46.155 --> 00:47:57.182]  What I agree or disagree with, with, uh, Alex Jones, I mean, he's, you could become the president and one day this gonna haunt you because you, you have to be president for everybody.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:58.880]  You are a U.S.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.721]  Senator.
[00:48:00.121 --> 00:48:02.482]  Not just for Florida, you have to be for everybody.
[00:48:02.502 --> 00:48:05.504]  I mean, all of that he played to the camera.
[00:48:05.684 --> 00:48:06.785]  Yeah, that's all it was.
[00:48:12.577 --> 00:48:20.059]  I got front row tickets to the House hearing, and I'm going over there, and I'm going to go to the Senate hearing, too, because here's the deal.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:25.201]  They've had five hearings in the House the last year, and five hearings in the Senate about me.
[00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:31.183]  I mean, literally, they spent half the time about me, and they go, yeah, and we've got Alex Jones, this Russian agent.
[00:48:31.883 --> 00:48:37.967]  When they had McCarthy hearings with real communists being drugged into the hearings, which I think were good by the way, they faced their accuser!
[00:48:38.728 --> 00:48:49.335]  You got to go into the hearing and then Cohn and all the lawyers were sitting there and they were able to talk back to them.
[00:48:50.155 --> 00:48:51.356]  I want to be in hearings.
[00:48:51.536 --> 00:48:52.817]  I want to face these people.
[00:48:53.377 --> 00:48:54.278]  I'm not afraid of you!
[00:48:54.378 --> 00:48:55.379]  I'm not afraid of you!
[00:48:55.939 --> 00:48:57.662]  You're the one walking over and getting in my face, buddy.
[00:48:58.042 --> 00:49:01.306]  Well, you're the one who gets in the whole world's face.
[00:49:01.346 --> 00:49:02.748]  Hey, hey, you bump it up in the middle.
[00:49:02.768 --> 00:49:04.030]  No, you do, you old stinky man.
[00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.974]  I happen to be totally non-violent.
[00:49:06.994 --> 00:49:07.895]  All right, that's good.
[00:49:08.815 --> 00:49:09.796]  I'm always non-violent.
[00:49:09.816 --> 00:49:10.717]  You support the free speech?
[00:49:10.757 --> 00:49:11.738]  Your words are violent.
[00:49:11.758 --> 00:49:12.419]  You support free speech?
[00:49:12.439 --> 00:49:13.600]  Your words are violent.
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.903]  I do support free speech, but I do not support hate speech.
[00:49:17.084 --> 00:49:19.606]  Oh yeah, good old communist term.
[00:49:19.666 --> 00:49:21.548]  You're a white supremacist.
[00:49:21.628 --> 00:49:24.912]  That's a little worn out there, brother.
[00:49:25.092 --> 00:49:28.996]  He stands from all social media for his right-wing interests.
[00:49:29.036 --> 00:49:29.556]  So there you go.
[00:49:29.656 --> 00:49:32.557]  This is another fascist leftist that wants my speech banned.
[00:49:32.657 --> 00:49:33.678]  But I'm from here.
[00:49:33.958 --> 00:49:34.458]  I'm from here.
[00:49:34.498 --> 00:49:38.439]  And look, she's strutting around arrogantly saying it's good that people are getting banned.
[00:49:38.779 --> 00:49:40.360]  So you don't support the First Amendment, do you?
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.400]  I support everything.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:42.761]  I serve this country.
[00:49:42.781 --> 00:49:44.181]  What did you do?
[00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:44.961]  What did you do?
[00:49:45.162 --> 00:49:49.503]  You just got really excited about going, oh, he got banned, all the bunch of stuff.
[00:49:49.543 --> 00:49:50.703]  Does it hurt to be that salty?
[00:49:50.743 --> 00:49:51.784]  Does it hurt to be that salty?
[00:49:52.584 --> 00:49:54.446]  I'm telling you, our audience is double the size.
[00:49:54.546 --> 00:49:55.107]  I pity you.
[00:49:55.167 --> 00:49:55.687]  I pity you.
[00:49:55.707 --> 00:49:56.288]  I pity you.
[00:49:56.328 --> 00:49:57.369]  I pity you.
[00:49:57.429 --> 00:49:57.869]  I pity you.
[00:49:58.009 --> 00:50:00.572]  I pity you just a hateful, mindless leftist.
[00:50:00.612 --> 00:50:02.313]  I really feel sorry for you ladies.
[00:50:02.353 --> 00:50:05.076]  You think you're what's troubling us above everything else.
[00:50:05.116 --> 00:50:06.217]  You're so horrible.
[00:50:06.237 --> 00:50:07.118]  You're a terrible person.
[00:50:07.138 --> 00:50:08.359]  You sound like an A3.
[00:50:08.399 --> 00:50:09.600]  You're a bad person.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.242]  You sound like a kid.
[00:50:11.262 --> 00:50:12.003]  We're gonna yell at you.
[00:50:12.703 --> 00:50:15.324]  We're going to yell at you and make you feel bad.
[00:50:15.364 --> 00:50:16.825]  You're not supposed to talk back.
[00:50:16.865 --> 00:50:18.086]  You're supposed to just be a meme.
[00:50:18.106 --> 00:50:19.847]  I just don't even know.
[00:50:19.927 --> 00:50:21.888]  I'm going to call you scum.
[00:50:22.168 --> 00:50:25.009]  And when you talk back, I just can't believe it.
[00:50:25.289 --> 00:50:26.330]  I just can't believe.
[00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:28.951]  I can't believe you actually talked back at me.
[00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:30.232]  I can't believe.
[00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:43.036]  They have used the lies of these committee hearing meetings in the House and Senate to de-platform me and un-person me off of the internet so that I can't respond to the future lies and the strongmen that they've built.
[00:50:43.516 --> 00:50:44.757]  This is a danger to this country.
[00:50:45.077 --> 00:50:55.203]  In what free nation do they have hearings at the national level and talk about someone like Alex Jones worth truly four hours and then never have a chance to then be heard by the committee?
[00:50:55.723 --> 00:51:09.688]  What country have we turned into for the New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN openly lobby to take me off every platform and openly lobby that anyone that talks about Alex Jones in a positive way will then also be blacklisted off the internet?
[00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:16.111]  Hours of them lying about me, just saying outrageous stuff where the Democrat congressmen and women all say some terrible thing.
[00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:18.795]  You know, like, you heard Alex Jones, you'll kill Jesus, right?
[00:51:18.815 --> 00:51:20.758]  They're like, yes, we know, but he can still be on us.
[00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:22.501]  They're like, well, we want him taken down.
[00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:28.290]  I mean, it was, it's, I sat there and I watched members of Congress in hearing after hearing say, we want InfoWars off the air.
[00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:34.554]  And then you've got Senator Murphy, you've got Senator Warner, you've got all these people.
[00:51:35.114 --> 00:51:39.617]  Senator Wyden saying, take Alex Jones completely off the internet and thousands of others.
[00:51:39.978 --> 00:51:43.260]  That is so un-American, that is so dangerous, that is so out of control.
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.743]  Wake up America, stop living like this, stop being idiots.
[00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:49.625]  Realize you're having your birthright stolen from you right now.
[00:51:49.665 --> 00:51:50.626]  This is serious business.
[00:51:51.166 --> 00:51:54.989]  We've been so trained to hate our own country that we see somebody who's pro-America and we think he's a bad guy.
[00:51:55.249 --> 00:51:56.510]  No, Hollywood's the enemy!
[00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:58.031]  I mean, my God!
[00:51:58.591 --> 00:52:01.093]  The left is literally recreating Nazi Germany here in America.
[00:52:07.297 --> 00:52:07.738]  Look it up!
[00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:11.060]  We've had them try to take our credit card processors away.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:11.800]  They took one away.
[00:52:12.401 --> 00:52:15.023]  Oh, you can have your own website.
[00:52:15.063 --> 00:52:16.624]  No, they're trying to take our website down right now.
[00:52:16.644 --> 00:52:18.325]  They're trying to take InfoWars.com down.
[00:52:18.745 --> 00:52:20.606]  Alright, Jack, you got time to do that interview now, brother?
[00:52:20.726 --> 00:52:21.247]  Thank you.
[00:52:27.028 --> 00:52:28.689]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:29.289 --> 00:52:40.656]  Now, again, it was about 20 minutes ago, it was the break before last, and I walk into the break room and people's mouths are hanging open, and I said, what's Obama doing?
[00:52:40.676 --> 00:52:42.797]  And they go, don't you know?
[00:52:43.037 --> 00:52:48.541]  They took you and everybody else off social media the last few weeks ahead of his big rollout.
[00:52:48.581 --> 00:52:50.242]  I go, oh yeah, I heard he's going to be on the campaign trail.
[00:52:51.155 --> 00:52:53.076]  And they're like, yeah, this is insane.
[00:52:53.797 --> 00:52:59.181]  They're like, two minutes ago, he was just saying that Trump has a good economy because of him.
[00:53:01.622 --> 00:53:03.924]  And then I was watching and then he took credit again.
[00:53:04.644 --> 00:53:07.767]  I then walked in here and said, hey, just back it up two minutes, that should be the spot.
[00:53:08.367 --> 00:53:12.330]  I'm not sure if it's the spot, but I'm told since then he's just been still taking credit.
[00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:19.055]  I guess the press conference is ongoing with former President Obama up there taking credit
[00:53:19.875 --> 00:53:20.275]  For the U.S.
[00:53:20.315 --> 00:53:27.418]  economy when he said it would never go to 3% and he said that there was a magic wand and all the rest of this.
[00:53:27.979 --> 00:53:31.260]  But before we get to the magic wand, let's just start going to some of this press conference.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.941]  And again, we're going to go through the whole thing later and have the clips.
[00:53:35.042 --> 00:53:39.344]  But he's taking credit every few minutes, so we probably picked the spot on the DVR where it's at.
[00:53:39.364 --> 00:53:39.644]  Here it is.
[00:53:39.664 --> 00:53:45.686]  We're here about this economic miracle that's been going on.
[00:53:47.247 --> 00:53:48.868]  When the job numbers come out,
[00:53:49.967 --> 00:53:54.831]  Monthly job numbers and suddenly Republicans are saying it's America.
[00:53:56.613 --> 00:54:02.718]  I had to kind of remind them, actually those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015.
[00:54:02.818 --> 00:54:02.938]  In 2016.
[00:54:02.978 --> 00:54:03.378]  And, anyway.
[00:54:04.159 --> 00:54:06.100]  It's not true?
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.084]  It's not true?
[00:54:12.165 --> 00:54:12.846]  I digress.
[00:54:14.747 --> 00:54:16.509]  Wow, he just randomly picked a spot.
[00:54:20.031 --> 00:54:30.716]  So we made progress, but, and this is the truth, my administration couldn't reverse 40-year trends in only eight years.
[00:54:32.397 --> 00:54:38.320]  Especially once Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2010 and decided to block everything we did.
[00:54:40.101 --> 00:54:42.222]  Even things they used to support.
[00:54:42.242 --> 00:54:48.706]  So we pulled the economy out of crisis, but to this day,
[00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:59.657]  Too many people who once felt solidly middle class still feel very real and very personal economic insecurity.
[00:54:59.977 --> 00:55:01.198]  Okay, let's stop there.
[00:55:01.338 --> 00:55:02.799]  I'm going to come back the next hour and play some more.
[00:55:02.879 --> 00:55:04.420]  So just, this is unbelievable.
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.421]  And I haven't seen much of it.
[00:55:05.441 --> 00:55:07.242]  I'm told it's just wall-to-wall BS.
[00:55:07.882 --> 00:55:09.423]  And so far you just heard whoppers.
[00:55:11.465 --> 00:55:12.085]  You're out of business.
[00:55:12.105 --> 00:55:12.886]  You didn't build that.
[00:55:12.906 --> 00:55:15.307]  2 plus 2 equals whatever I say it does.
[00:55:16.088 --> 00:55:17.589]  If you've got a doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[00:55:17.609 --> 00:55:18.630]  Obamacare is free.
[00:55:20.424 --> 00:55:21.745]  Trump will never get the economy up to 3%.
[00:55:21.845 --> 00:55:27.191]  Once he got a magic wand, he said it would never get to this level, but now it has.
[00:55:27.451 --> 00:55:29.593]  Let's hear that magic wand comment one more time.
[00:55:31.275 --> 00:55:40.344]  Somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for, that he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[00:55:41.285 --> 00:55:42.646]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[00:55:42.686 --> 00:55:43.287]  What are you going to do?
[00:55:46.038 --> 00:55:46.959]  There's no answer to it.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.803]  He just says, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[00:55:52.205 --> 00:55:54.187]  How exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[00:55:55.248 --> 00:55:56.629]  What magic wand do you have?
[00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:01.114]  And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.
[00:56:02.447 --> 00:56:20.881]  And this is from a couple of years ago and it's already up and they also go well it's at 3.9% or it's at 4.2% but only this quarter and then they'll even be on CNBC and go no it's actually since he got elected president it went to 3% the 3.2, 3.5, 4, 4.2 projected to be at 4.6 right now but the final numbers aren't in so that's all coming up
[00:56:27.762 --> 00:56:36.307]  But yes, we're all being banned and shadow banned and blocked ahead of the midterms now, 55, 59 and a half days out.
[00:56:36.528 --> 00:56:41.331]  We're 60 days out, 59 and a half days technically, out from this incredibly important election.
[00:56:41.511 --> 00:56:44.693]  And all I can say is, everything is on the line.
[00:56:44.933 --> 00:56:46.234]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[00:56:46.774 --> 00:56:49.436]  And they wouldn't be doing a mad dash to censor everybody.
[00:56:49.676 --> 00:56:50.596]  I mean, look at these articles.
[00:56:50.617 --> 00:56:51.597]  There's so many of these.
[00:56:51.637 --> 00:56:52.358]  Just type my name in.
[00:56:54.098 --> 00:56:57.120]  In the U.S., a lot of twisted people have access to guns.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.801]  That's why Alex Jones and Infowars were too dangerous not to be banned.
[00:57:01.402 --> 00:57:01.742]  That's right.
[00:57:02.042 --> 00:57:04.343]  It's CNN saying, hashtag, hunt Republicans.
[00:57:04.623 --> 00:57:07.484]  It's CNN saying the guy that shot Scalise was a hero.
[00:57:07.984 --> 00:57:10.205]  They're the ones calling for Barron to be kidnapped and raped.
[00:57:10.545 --> 00:57:12.806]  They're the ones that have antifit running around doing all this.
[00:57:13.126 --> 00:57:15.467]  It's leftists stabbing the Brazilian Trump in the stomach.
[00:57:15.788 --> 00:57:17.168]  They're the ones nine times out of ten.
[00:57:17.208 --> 00:57:20.670]  But now, I can't be on air preemptively.
[00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:28.973]  Because I'm going to cause people to go shoot folks with guns because the media lied and said that I said get your battles rifles ready for the media.
[00:57:29.173 --> 00:57:31.314]  Which they won't show me saying because it's a lie.
[00:57:31.834 --> 00:57:33.655]  So I say to Jack Dorsey, hey I didn't say that.
[00:57:34.095 --> 00:57:37.916]  Magic Wand being your band because we're not going to let you respond to our lies.
[00:57:38.376 --> 00:57:40.317]  We're going to tell our lies and hope they work.
[00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:43.058]  Let's see folks are already awake to you so it doesn't work.
[00:57:43.458 --> 00:57:44.479]  Please support the broadcast.

[00:58:52.188 --> 00:58:59.456]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:58:59.856 --> 00:59:07.324]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:59:07.764 --> 00:59:10.868]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:59:11.488 --> 00:59:15.752]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:59:16.132 --> 00:59:20.035]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:59:20.255 --> 00:59:22.997]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:59:23.418 --> 00:59:27.721]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:59:28.181 --> 00:59:31.184]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:59:31.644 --> 00:59:46.511]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[00:59:46.711 --> 00:59:47.991]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:59:48.231 --> 00:59:50.692]  We will prevail if you take action, and I know you will.
[00:59:56.255 --> 01:00:00.176]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:13.922 --> 01:00:19.095]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:19.576 --> 01:00:21.942]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:44.941]  All right, if you just joined us, I got the DVR up here in the studio of Obama just 20 minutes ago, live, giving a press conference or a speech, and it's just unbelievable.
[01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:51.887]  We've been stopping and starting at random times, and he's taking credit for the 4.2% growth rate, the 4.6% projection.
[01:00:52.307 --> 01:00:55.731]  He's taking credit, saying his economy is what did this.
[01:00:56.932 --> 01:00:59.294]  I mean, I haven't seen much of it.
[01:00:59.354 --> 01:01:00.155]  It's all horrible.
[01:01:00.575 --> 01:01:08.960]  So we're just going to start randomly playing it from early on, this segment, the next, and analyzing it, because I've been told by folks that watched it live, it is a whopper.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.422]  Because remember, he said it'll never go to 3%.
[01:01:11.462 --> 01:01:13.423]  There is no magic wand.
[01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.124]  Paul Krugman, New York Times.
[01:01:16.905 --> 01:01:17.746]  This is crazy.
[01:01:18.806 --> 01:01:22.509]  And notice, I've been banned from everything
[01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:26.785]  A day out from him now re-emerging.
[01:01:26.845 --> 01:01:27.425]  It's not just me.
[01:01:27.766 --> 01:01:30.427]  Thousands of libertarian, conservative, pro-Trump accounts.
[01:01:30.868 --> 01:01:34.650]  It's happening absolutely everywhere right now.
[01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.652]  And they are making their move.
[01:01:37.972 --> 01:01:38.573]  So what do we do?
[01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:42.220]  We don't let them steal our Republic or take our First Amendment.
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.521]  You hit the third dimension.
[01:01:43.561 --> 01:01:44.401]  You go to colleges.
[01:01:44.421 --> 01:01:45.702]  You go to speak at city council.
[01:01:46.062 --> 01:01:47.143]  You call in to talk radio.
[01:01:47.163 --> 01:01:48.124]  You call in to C-SPAN.
[01:01:48.524 --> 01:01:52.066]  You hand out cards with Infowars.com and say forbid information.
[01:01:52.827 --> 01:02:03.814]  You redouble your efforts because the reason they're getting so desperate right now, and the reason Infowarsarmy.com is so critical, is they've got internal polls that have already come out.
[01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:05.996]  Even CNN hit the panic button last week and said, okay,
[01:02:06.946 --> 01:02:07.807]  Looks like a red wave.
[01:02:07.827 --> 01:02:10.248]  Looks like the Trump effect is unstoppable.
[01:02:10.328 --> 01:02:11.649]  We are going to lose big.
[01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:13.830]  And they said, what are we going to do?
[01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:14.911]  And they said, 25th Amendment.
[01:02:14.951 --> 01:02:15.711]  Get him out now.
[01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:16.452]  Get him out now.
[01:02:16.672 --> 01:02:17.632]  Publish fake reports.
[01:02:18.133 --> 01:02:20.274]  All the people that are quoted say, I never said that.
[01:02:20.314 --> 01:02:21.174]  There's no tapes of it.
[01:02:22.215 --> 01:02:25.997]  It's solid lies, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:26.938 --> 01:02:31.661]  So let's go to some more of President Obama telling incredible whoppers.
[01:02:31.701 --> 01:02:32.001]  Here it is.
[01:02:37.358 --> 01:02:38.620]  That's the story of America.
[01:02:43.285 --> 01:02:44.406]  A story of progress.
[01:02:46.689 --> 01:02:49.352]  Fitful progress, incomplete progress, but progress.
[01:02:49.952 --> 01:02:50.553]  Hit pause.
[01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:52.956]  Well, you can tell where this is going.
[01:02:53.396 --> 01:02:54.418]  Back in another minute, please.
[01:02:55.558 --> 01:02:56.978]  I haven't even seen this, I know where it's going.
[01:02:57.318 --> 01:03:00.719]  Progressivism, progress, things getting better because of bigger government.
[01:03:01.059 --> 01:03:02.559]  No, that's not the history of the United States.
[01:03:02.599 --> 01:03:04.200]  It's rugged individualism.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:05.520]  It's swashbuckling.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.920]  It's inventiveness.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.901]  It's the dynamic human spirit.
[01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:19.543]  But they act like we have a totally open border, come here, be inducted into racial hatred of white people, and become a socialist under a victim ideology.
[01:03:20.908 --> 01:03:23.830]  We need to hear from you, just a little something.
[01:03:45.091 --> 01:03:48.112]  Oh my gosh, you know what, I've got to back this up at the start again.
[01:03:48.532 --> 01:03:52.054]  Wow, they're not clapping and he's having to tell them to clap.
[01:03:52.654 --> 01:03:55.755]  Wow, this is amazingly train wreckish.
[01:03:56.095 --> 01:03:57.136]  Let me just stop right there then.
[01:03:57.556 --> 01:03:58.636]  I'm going to try to be a good boy.
[01:03:59.196 --> 01:04:06.839]  It's just that everything I see is just cringeworthy failure with some packed audience of low-energy, drooling zombos.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:13.342]  When you go to the Capitol, state, capital, or federal, and you see someone that looks like they've had a lobotomy, black, white, old, young,
[01:04:14.022 --> 01:04:17.845]  dragging over to you and they start saying, no NRA, no KKK.
[01:04:18.365 --> 01:04:19.806]  You know they've been paid.
[01:04:21.807 --> 01:04:22.288]  You know.
[01:04:22.308 --> 01:04:26.971]  So this is echoes of Jeb Bush saying, please clap.
[01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:28.912]  Come on.
[01:04:29.293 --> 01:04:32.355]  But on Colbert, they bring in folks have the applause.
[01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:35.510]  I mean, you know, hit the applause lights.
[01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:36.331]  Come on, applause!
[01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:38.472]  Sometimes I got folks out front going, come on!
[01:04:38.572 --> 01:04:39.132]  Come on!
[01:04:39.232 --> 01:04:39.813]  Come on!
[01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:40.693]  Clap!
[01:04:40.973 --> 01:04:41.674]  Woo!
[01:04:42.414 --> 01:04:44.495]  Yeah, let's bring down America, have a race war!
[01:04:44.555 --> 01:04:45.096]  Woo!
[01:04:45.156 --> 01:04:45.816]  Yeah!
[01:04:46.336 --> 01:04:47.237]  Oh, ban the guns!
[01:04:47.297 --> 01:04:48.138]  Woo!
[01:04:48.658 --> 01:04:49.178]  Woo!
[01:04:49.198 --> 01:04:49.979]  Be like Venezuela!
[01:04:50.059 --> 01:04:50.679]  Woo!
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.182]  Maybe I should get a laugh track going in the background, you know, like old shows.
[01:04:55.222 --> 01:04:55.662]  There you go.
[01:04:55.682 --> 01:04:57.703]  Yeah, there's old Colbert.
[01:04:57.763 --> 01:05:00.285]  He gets to say how Hitler or anybody else does their careers over.
[01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:12.053]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[01:05:12.454 --> 01:05:13.334]  And I want to thank you all.
[01:05:13.414 --> 01:05:14.395]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[01:05:14.415 --> 01:05:16.196]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[01:05:16.236 --> 01:05:22.499]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[01:05:22.759 --> 01:05:24.900]  And we've got products that help you.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.062]  I mean, even mainstream media admits, they have to, that fish oil is the best thing out there.
[01:05:28.102 --> 01:05:29.323]  But you want pure fish oil.
[01:05:29.403 --> 01:05:30.784]  You want the mercury removed.
[01:05:30.924 --> 01:05:33.225]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[01:05:33.325 --> 01:05:41.227]  The best krill oil, the best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic, salmon, and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids, the honor roll.
[01:05:41.247 --> 01:05:41.867]  Three different types.
[01:05:41.887 --> 01:05:42.827]  You cannot do better.
[01:05:42.887 --> 01:05:43.727]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:43.747 --> 01:05:45.988]  Help the brain, help the body, help the heart, help the InfoWar.
[01:05:46.068 --> 01:05:46.828]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[01:05:46.928 --> 01:05:49.248]  And then we've got Ultimate Tumor Formula, about to sell out bodies.
[01:05:49.328 --> 01:05:50.069]  That's 50% off.
[01:05:50.169 --> 01:05:51.189]  Bone broth, I'm about to cut.
[01:05:51.209 --> 01:05:52.069]  That's special this week.
[01:05:52.189 --> 01:05:53.989]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:59.771]  I really appreciate you standing with us, but we need massive capital infusions so I can energize to take on Soros and Hillary.
[01:06:00.091 --> 01:06:00.491]  I need it!
[01:06:25.532 --> 01:06:33.014]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:33.094 --> 01:06:39.176]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:39.576 --> 01:06:41.636]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:42.516 --> 01:06:44.657]  I gotta tell you, I miss Obama.
[01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:51.201]  Because especially now, he literally is riding Trump's magic wand here.
[01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:52.741]  He got tired of Michelle's.
[01:06:53.702 --> 01:06:58.123]  And he is doing the most incredible stuff you have ever seen.
[01:06:58.143 --> 01:07:00.504]  Now, I've only stopped and started this 30-minute speech.
[01:07:00.544 --> 01:07:01.824]  I've only seen, like, five minutes of it.
[01:07:01.944 --> 01:07:03.525]  It's all whoppers.
[01:07:04.065 --> 01:07:06.946]  Every 10 seconds is a galactic-level lie.
[01:07:07.386 --> 01:07:08.807]  So let's control ourselves, Owen.
[01:07:09.027 --> 01:07:12.648]  Owen Schroer, I'm the shotgun host of The War Room, 3 o'clock Central every day.
[01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:14.729]  Let's just write down notes, because
[01:07:15.749 --> 01:07:17.290]  It starts out with him not clapping.
[01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:19.471]  So he says, oh, just a little applause.
[01:07:19.531 --> 01:07:19.932]  Come on.
[01:07:20.032 --> 01:07:21.072]  So bombshelled.
[01:07:21.252 --> 01:07:21.673]  He can't even.
[01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:23.714]  He's reemerged after the purge.
[01:07:24.715 --> 01:07:34.381]  As Trump said, millions of conservatives and Christians, thousands of prominent people, everyone I know has been banned off major platforms or totally banned or shadow banned.
[01:07:34.781 --> 01:07:36.822]  I mean, it's just every hour the numbers are coming in.
[01:07:37.142 --> 01:07:38.703]  You had a bunch of your stuff banned yesterday.
[01:07:38.723 --> 01:07:39.624]  Everybody that works here.
[01:07:40.805 --> 01:07:44.407]  Anthony Cumia had all his stuff banned simultaneously, and they admittedly
[01:07:46.038 --> 01:07:57.245]  The AP, BuzzFeed, all of them the same minute published huge articles about why I was banned, what I did, I bullied an innocent person, they won't say what, they speculate it was another child totally made up.
[01:07:57.265 --> 01:08:00.948]  It was Oliver Darcy who is the bully trying to get me deplatformed.
[01:08:00.968 --> 01:08:04.390]  So then they have a congressman going, Jones tries to silence the innocent.
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.141]  No, you just silenced me.
[01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:10.824]  So everything is inversion because they're in full panic mode.
[01:08:10.844 --> 01:08:11.484]  So Owen's here.
[01:08:12.345 --> 01:08:21.711]  We're gonna play and try to be good boys and get to this because this just he just concluded this train wreck speech a few minutes ago and it is the ultimate whopper.
[01:08:22.192 --> 01:08:27.856]  I mean they they got caught lying in the last election and so they said the answer is lies of the next level.
[01:08:28.556 --> 01:08:30.157]  Well, I've never seen such lying, Owen.
[01:08:30.458 --> 01:08:44.190]  Well, I've been watching this speech from the beginning, and let me tell you, first of all, the biggest difference, the biggest noticeable difference, is Obama no longer has his confidence, he no longer has his swag, he's obviously desperate, he's in fear.
[01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:53.898]  Remember, he's been hiding for the last two years, so this is like him coming out of the woodworks, finally, to fight for the Democrat Party because he's been so scared of whatever is going on behind the scenes.
[01:08:53.938 --> 01:08:55.119]  The possum's crawling out of this
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:03.215]  But he's not Obama, so he's up there fumbling and stumbling and bumbling all through this speech, like you said, next-level propaganda.
[01:09:03.255 --> 01:09:05.019]  I mean, the average American, Alex...
[01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:10.704]  Listening to an Obama speech when he was President or State of the Union, he was smooth.
[01:09:10.744 --> 01:09:12.686]  That was smooth propaganda, baby.
[01:09:12.926 --> 01:09:14.987]  The average American is not going to pick up on that.
[01:09:15.488 --> 01:09:16.228]  This speech?
[01:09:16.688 --> 01:09:21.572]  The average American is going to hear this speech and their eyes are going to go, whoa!
[01:09:22.112 --> 01:09:24.354]  What in the hell is going on here?
[01:09:24.574 --> 01:09:25.595]  I have some of the quotes... No, I agree.
[01:09:25.615 --> 01:09:26.495]  They've gone crazy.
[01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:29.477]  Because just what I've watched is just like whoppers.
[01:09:29.658 --> 01:09:31.639]  I mean, I'm the reason the economy's better.
[01:09:31.759 --> 01:09:33.060]  I always said this would happen.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.782]  No, you said it would never happen!
[01:09:35.282 --> 01:09:38.346]  Oh, you just dipped your foot in the pool, Alex.
[01:09:38.866 --> 01:09:39.367]  I'm telling you.
[01:09:40.288 --> 01:09:47.055]  What I'm almost thinking about doing, Alex, is playing Trump's speech last night in Billings, Montana.
[01:09:47.315 --> 01:09:48.597]  Just total kick-ass.
[01:09:48.937 --> 01:09:54.739]  Real applause, American power, America's great, we're coming back, we kick ass, I love you!
[01:09:55.139 --> 01:10:09.005]  And then after you play that, play Obama's speech where it's like, America sucked, but I made America great, and everybody's racist and awful, but if I was president, we'd be better, and rich people suck, and white people suck, and it's just like, oh my God!
[01:10:09.645 --> 01:10:10.845]  Like, what is going on?
[01:10:11.105 --> 01:10:21.208]  How do you have the President of the United States give a rousing, real speech last night, telling you how great America is, to Obama, the former President, fumbling and bumbling and muttering and stuttering?
[01:10:21.228 --> 01:10:22.448]  Here's why he knows they're screwed.
[01:10:22.548 --> 01:10:23.749]  They can destroy me.
[01:10:23.849 --> 01:10:25.209]  They can maybe even kill Trump.
[01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:26.790]  People now are awake.
[01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:27.930]  They've got the internal polls.
[01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:33.611]  And they're even, like I said, the Democrats hit the panic button last week in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and CNN.
[01:10:33.631 --> 01:10:35.252]  They said, no, it's a red wave.
[01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:35.712]  We're screwed.
[01:10:36.292 --> 01:10:38.917]  And so, they said the Trump effect is in full effect.
[01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:40.159]  He's unstoppable.
[01:10:40.239 --> 01:10:41.341]  America hates us now.
[01:10:41.822 --> 01:10:42.643]  What are we going to do?
[01:10:42.663 --> 01:10:49.875]  And that's when Panetta, the former head of the CIA, and the former head of the NSA, Hayden, came out and said, we need to stop now.
[01:10:51.544 --> 01:10:55.665]  The problem is Trump derangement syndrome, they're coming on like a stampede of crazy cows.
[01:10:56.246 --> 01:10:57.066]  Yeah, they can't stop.
[01:10:57.366 --> 01:10:58.346]  That's the most incredible thing.
[01:10:58.366 --> 01:10:58.827]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:10:58.927 --> 01:11:00.367]  Trump bump has become a tsunami.
[01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:02.208]  Let's just go to this Obama story.
[01:11:02.248 --> 01:11:09.030]  I'm telling you, Alex, the average American, and everyone rebroadcasts this, they rebroadcast this on every major newspaper.
[01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:11.351]  They ban us, and then this is what they ought to be banning.
[01:11:13.292 --> 01:11:13.752]  I'm sorry.
[01:11:13.972 --> 01:11:14.632]  I'm sorry, folks.
[01:11:14.972 --> 01:11:15.973]  Here, just go to it.
[01:11:16.033 --> 01:11:16.413]  Go to it.
[01:11:19.212 --> 01:11:20.773]  He said, is it really that hard to say Nazis are bad?
[01:11:20.793 --> 01:11:34.482]  The point that is essential to American democracy is that in a government of and by and for the people, there should be no permanent ruling class.
[01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:36.743]  Which is what Trump upset.
[01:11:36.763 --> 01:11:37.624]  They're only citizens.
[01:11:38.264 --> 01:11:39.265]  Then it's the ruling class that's bad.
[01:11:39.285 --> 01:11:45.969]  Which is why elected and temporary representatives determine our course and determine our character.
[01:11:49.065 --> 01:12:03.296]  I'm here today because this is one of those pivotal moments when every one of us, as citizens of the United States, need to determine just who it is that we are.
[01:12:05.477 --> 01:12:06.819]  Just what it is that we stand for.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.060]  As citizens, huh?
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.381]  And as a fellow citizen.
[01:12:10.561 --> 01:12:11.182]  He's a globalist.
[01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:13.791]  They don't want citizens on the upcoming census.
[01:12:13.991 --> 01:12:21.334]  But as a fellow citizen, I'm here to deliver a simple message, and that is that you need to vote because our democracy depends on it.
[01:12:23.655 --> 01:12:25.036]  He didn't have to ask for that applause.
[01:12:30.123 --> 01:12:31.544]  It's coming up, we backed it up enough.
[01:12:32.904 --> 01:12:34.365]  We'll get the non-applause in here in a minute.
[01:12:34.385 --> 01:12:41.828]  Some of you may think I'm exaggerating when I say this November's elections are more important than any I can remember in my lifetime.
[01:12:41.928 --> 01:12:42.469]  Oh, that's true.
[01:12:42.589 --> 01:12:43.469]  Well, a rare moment of truth.
[01:12:43.589 --> 01:12:45.230]  I know politicians say that all the time.
[01:12:47.331 --> 01:12:50.632]  I have been guilty of saying it a few times, particularly when I was on the ballot.
[01:12:51.773 --> 01:12:52.573]  Yes, you're guilty of.
[01:12:54.934 --> 01:12:58.436]  But just a glance at recent headlines.
[01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:01.993]  Should tell you that this moment really is different.
[01:13:02.594 --> 01:13:03.434]  Read our corporate news.
[01:13:03.874 --> 01:13:05.294]  The stakes really are higher.
[01:13:07.534 --> 01:13:13.755]  The consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more dire.
[01:13:17.256 --> 01:13:23.337]  And it's not as if we haven't had big elections before or big choices to make in our history.
[01:13:24.577 --> 01:13:26.358]  Fact is, democracy has never been easy.
[01:13:26.818 --> 01:13:28.858]  And our founding fathers argued about everything.
[01:13:31.496 --> 01:13:32.196]  Founding fathers.
[01:13:32.216 --> 01:13:33.537]  We waged a civil war.
[01:13:34.137 --> 01:13:36.657]  He's trying to sound like an American now, but he's not.
[01:13:36.697 --> 01:13:37.738]  We came to pressure.
[01:13:37.858 --> 01:13:38.458]  He's a globalist.
[01:13:40.338 --> 01:13:47.120]  We've lurched from eras of great progressive change to periods of retrenchment.
[01:13:50.981 --> 01:13:59.363]  Still, most Americans alive today, certainly the students who are here, have operated
[01:14:00.501 --> 01:14:04.323]  Under some common assumptions about who we are and what we stand for.
[01:14:08.345 --> 01:14:15.248]  Out of the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Depression, America adapted a new economy.
[01:14:15.989 --> 01:14:17.309]  A 20th century economy.
[01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:25.113]  Guiding our free market with regulations to protect health and safety and fair competition.
[01:14:25.814 --> 01:14:26.154]  Oh yeah.
[01:14:26.934 --> 01:14:27.795]  Empowering workers.
[01:14:28.752 --> 01:14:29.573]  With you in China.
[01:14:30.034 --> 01:14:31.075]  Shipping your jobs to China.
[01:14:31.456 --> 01:14:41.268]  Investing in science and infrastructure and educational institutions like U of I. Strengthening our system of
[01:14:42.935 --> 01:14:44.556]  Primary and secondary education.
[01:14:44.636 --> 01:14:45.196]  Alright, hit pause.
[01:14:45.236 --> 01:14:46.137]  This is really hard to hear.
[01:14:46.157 --> 01:14:48.559]  Because I was listening later when all the whopper lies.
[01:14:48.599 --> 01:14:49.199]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:49.219 --> 01:14:49.939]  This is the beginning.
[01:14:49.959 --> 01:14:51.600]  He's kind of greasing the crowd right now.
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:57.304]  He starts laying out the propaganda and starts fumbling and bumbling like a miserable fool pretty soon here.
[01:14:57.324 --> 01:14:58.965]  Alright, we'll come back on the other side.
[01:14:59.005 --> 01:15:00.046]  This is really hard to watch.
[01:15:00.146 --> 01:15:03.168]  We're going to do it, but it gets really hilarious here in a minute.
[01:15:03.888 --> 01:15:04.869]  We'll cover it on the other side.
[01:15:04.949 --> 01:15:06.590]  Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, that
[01:15:07.631 --> 01:15:11.213]  He represents the folks that don't want you to be wealthy or successful or independent.
[01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:14.355]  He represents those that want you to live in austerity and poor to control your life.
[01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:15.115]  He admits that.
[01:15:15.135 --> 01:15:17.256]  He goes to Africa and says, you have to stay poor.
[01:15:17.857 --> 01:15:18.917]  This guy is a monster.
[01:15:19.798 --> 01:15:21.059]  We are asking you.
[01:15:21.079 --> 01:15:22.800]  We're not funded by the Rockefellers.
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.000]  We're not funded by the globalists.
[01:15:24.661 --> 01:15:26.161]  We're not funded by any of these people.
[01:15:26.982 --> 01:15:28.803]  We are funded by you.
[01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:33.646]  And so when you buy the products at InfoWareStore.com, just pause it.
[01:15:33.886 --> 01:15:34.126]  It's good.
[01:15:34.827 --> 01:15:36.268]  I'm just going to tell them we can stop it there.
[01:15:36.308 --> 01:15:36.588]  That's good.
[01:15:36.608 --> 01:15:36.888]  Thank you.
[01:15:37.268 --> 01:15:38.109]  I want to come back where we were at.
[01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.409]  Thank you.
[01:15:39.569 --> 01:15:41.490]  Again, I'm always directing things in here on air live.
[01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:41.870]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:43.871]  It's part of the distraction stuff and I go crazy.
[01:15:43.891 --> 01:15:48.413]  But anyways, most people should not be doing a radio TV show and then directing it themselves live on air.
[01:15:48.653 --> 01:15:52.135]  But I just want to come back with the interview with Obama.
[01:15:52.555 --> 01:15:54.936]  Anyways, if you don't fund us, we won't be here.
[01:15:55.657 --> 01:15:58.278]  We won't be able to operate and they'll be able to shut us down.
[01:15:58.598 --> 01:16:00.879]  And we've got great products that you need.
[01:16:01.559 --> 01:16:02.160]  We've got them there.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.422]  Well, I'm here in the Infowars bunker, and I'm coming to you from one of our new studios.
[01:16:09.102 --> 01:16:14.224]  We've gained hundreds of new affiliates last month, but my god, Soros and the communist Chinese are coming down on us hard.
[01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:19.766]  And you know, I see Google and Facebook and Apple especially moving to China and helping suppress their people.
[01:16:21.026 --> 01:16:21.606]  It freaks me out.
[01:16:22.467 --> 01:16:25.628]  Because China has killed five times the number of people that Adolf Hitler did.
[01:16:26.588 --> 01:16:31.310]  But oh, because they're Chinese, it's okay, because media taught us only white people can do bad stuff.
[01:16:32.551 --> 01:16:38.315]  It freaks me out to see all these big tech companies saying, let's just ban Trump supporters, period.
[01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:40.276]  Let's ban all Alex Jones supporters.
[01:16:41.137 --> 01:16:45.900]  They're putting us in a digital gulag, but the good news is humanity is fighting back.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.962]  And that's why I'm coming to you from this new studio.
[01:16:49.184 --> 01:16:54.706]  That we're building is one of the most state-of-the-art in the country to transmit the truth worldwide to the people.
[01:16:55.446 --> 01:16:56.587]  We've got big plans.
[01:16:57.207 --> 01:17:02.329]  That's why I'm asking all of you, however you can support or whatever you can do, we are all in this together.
[01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:03.750]  Look at this studio.
[01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:05.030]  Look at what we're doing.
[01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:06.411]  Look at the crew we're hiring.
[01:17:06.731 --> 01:17:07.991]  Look at all the things that are happening.
[01:17:08.551 --> 01:17:08.992]  It's epic.
[01:17:10.272 --> 01:17:12.473]  And then, take these products right here.
[01:17:14.158 --> 01:17:16.779]  We have the best fish oil for adults and children.
[01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:20.661]  We have the best CoQ10 and PQQ.
[01:17:20.701 --> 01:17:23.402]  We have the best bone broth, it's all there.
[01:17:24.362 --> 01:17:29.385]  You get these products, you get things that help you and your body and your family, and they help fund the information war.
[01:17:29.685 --> 01:17:31.005]  And these sales are gonna end this week.
[01:17:31.986 --> 01:17:37.588]  So I commend you, I salute you, I thank you, but take advantage of these sales right now, some of the biggest ever.
[01:17:37.608 --> 01:17:39.389]  50% off on many of these products.
[01:17:39.769 --> 01:17:41.590]  Free shipping on many of the items, you name it.
[01:17:42.506 --> 01:17:43.547]  And we'll be able to move forward.
[01:17:44.468 --> 01:17:47.410]  Quite frankly, it's crazy how this stuff works.
[01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:51.973]  Because every attack they launch, you bring in just enough support to counter it.
[01:17:51.993 --> 01:17:53.775]  Then they attack again, just enough support.
[01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:59.099]  You know, the Patriot in me wants to see us way up here to feel confident, but that's not how God works.
[01:17:59.899 --> 01:18:04.583]  It's you that keep hanging with us and making the decision to support us, that as they double down, you double down.
[01:18:04.863 --> 01:18:06.845]  As they attack, you move back against them.
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.061]  It's an amazing time.
[01:18:09.301 --> 01:18:10.081]  The products are great.
[01:18:10.282 --> 01:18:11.122]  The t-shirts are great.
[01:18:11.182 --> 01:18:11.823]  The books are great.
[01:18:11.943 --> 01:18:12.763]  All the material is great.
[01:18:13.104 --> 01:18:13.984]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:14.264 --> 01:18:18.888]  Without you, we're not going to be able to launch this and counter these jerks.
[01:18:19.548 --> 01:18:23.511]  Without you, they're going to use us as the template, the blueprint, to shut all of you down.
[01:18:24.392 --> 01:18:26.413]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done.
[01:18:26.433 --> 01:18:27.634]  I want to commend you for what you've done.
[01:18:27.694 --> 01:18:29.696]  I want to encourage you now more than ever.
[01:18:30.461 --> 01:18:36.243]  To think about what you're doing in history, and the fact you've already committed so much to freedom, you've already seen so many good things happen.
[01:18:36.863 --> 01:18:46.126]  Now's the time to double down against these jerks, the New York Times, and CNN, and the jerks over at the Washington Post, and the Chi-Com murderers, and the scum in Hollywood.
[01:18:46.426 --> 01:18:48.407]  We're standing against them, and we're delivering.
[01:18:48.927 --> 01:18:52.729]  And the economy's coming back, and people are coming together, but they're counter-striking.
[01:18:53.109 --> 01:18:56.390]  And without you standing with us, we will be shut down.
[01:18:57.190 --> 01:18:58.351]  They want to demoralize you.
[01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:00.232]  They want to tell you you're weak.
[01:19:00.492 --> 01:19:05.676]  They want to say we're losing in the face of this attack because they want you to think your support didn't do jack squat.
[01:19:06.717 --> 01:19:09.879]  Your support has taken us to the most traffic InfoWars has ever gotten.
[01:19:10.359 --> 01:19:11.941]  And has brought in the most money we've ever gotten.
[01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:13.742]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:19:14.764 --> 01:19:17.305]  Until they banned us, we were losing money for six, seven months.
[01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:21.167]  Because people thought everything was fine, and you know, Trump was there and everything was okay.
[01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:24.248]  And so we're still behind for the year of what we need to expand.
[01:19:24.728 --> 01:19:25.589]  We might even contract.
[01:19:26.029 --> 01:19:31.491]  But with current numbers, it looks like we're going to be able to launch the expansion, and the satellites, and everything, thanks to you!
[01:19:32.092 --> 01:19:33.252]  But it's up to you right now!
[01:19:34.113 --> 01:19:37.094]  My fighting spirit's never been stronger because I can feel the enemies about to bring it.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:38.801]  To their next level.
[01:19:38.821 --> 01:19:40.502]  But we're gonna bring it to our next level as well.
[01:19:41.002 --> 01:19:43.464]  So I'm counting on you right now and I love you and I appreciate you.
[01:19:43.825 --> 01:19:48.809]  So whatever you do, however you do it, legally and lawfully, get the word out and support InfoWars.
[01:19:49.109 --> 01:19:50.770]  It's symbiotic, it supports you as well.
[01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:52.111]  I thank you again.
[01:19:52.132 --> 01:19:55.975]  This is quite an epic time of your life.
[01:19:55.995 --> 01:19:57.736]  60 days out from the election right now.
[01:19:59.578 --> 01:20:00.518]  History's happening right now.
[01:20:01.319 --> 01:20:02.220]  What are you gonna do right now?
[01:20:06.849 --> 01:20:11.512]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.554 --> 01:20:19.517]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:21.638 --> 01:20:23.679]  Okay, so you're learning about this as we're learning about it.
[01:20:23.699 --> 01:20:25.100]  This just ended a few minutes ago.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.481]  We've got the whole thing taped.
[01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:28.302]  And we've got the headlines.
[01:20:28.382 --> 01:20:29.482]  Owen watched a bunch of it.
[01:20:29.562 --> 01:20:30.283]  It's headlines like...
[01:20:31.522 --> 01:20:34.463]  Obama angry, Trump taking credit for his economy.
[01:20:34.823 --> 01:20:37.643]  These are the headlines that are going out.
[01:20:37.763 --> 01:20:44.025]  So he was just busy telling us about what America's real history is, about government coming and making it great.
[01:20:44.705 --> 01:20:52.587]  And so, Owen, you've got some of these quotes, but let's just get right back into what the president, former president Obama was just saying.
[01:20:52.627 --> 01:20:52.967]  Here it is.
[01:20:57.428 --> 01:20:59.288]  The status quo pushes back.
[01:21:01.542 --> 01:21:02.122]  Oh yeah, here we go.
[01:21:03.383 --> 01:21:06.544]  Sometimes the backlash comes from people who are 15.
[01:21:08.224 --> 01:21:08.664]  In 2016.
[01:21:09.004 --> 01:21:11.505]  And... Anyway.
[01:21:14.146 --> 01:21:14.786]  I digress.
[01:21:15.506 --> 01:21:16.607]  That's a total lie.
[01:21:22.028 --> 01:21:25.250]  So we made progress, but... And this is the truth.
[01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:29.731]  My administration couldn't reverse 40-year trends.
[01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:32.685]  In only eight years.
[01:21:33.206 --> 01:21:33.886]  Trump did it in two.
[01:21:34.386 --> 01:21:40.267]  Especially once Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2010 and decided to block everything we did.
[01:21:40.287 --> 01:21:41.927]  Except Obamacare.
[01:21:42.087 --> 01:21:44.228]  Even things they used to support.
[01:21:46.648 --> 01:21:49.149]  So we pulled the economy out of crisis.
[01:21:49.749 --> 01:21:58.851]  But to this day, too many people who once felt solidly middle class still feel very real
[01:21:59.693 --> 01:22:01.654]  And very personal economic insecurity.
[01:22:01.674 --> 01:22:04.335]  What did you say?
[01:22:04.355 --> 01:22:05.035]  You want to keep going?
[01:22:05.196 --> 01:22:08.397]  Even though we took out Bin Laden.
[01:22:08.437 --> 01:22:10.778]  Tell me Alex, this is about to get unreal, man.
[01:22:11.338 --> 01:22:13.499]  In Iraq, in our combat role in Afghanistan.
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.180]  And got Iran to halt its nuclear program.
[01:22:17.801 --> 01:22:19.282]  The world's still full of threats.
[01:22:19.782 --> 01:22:21.503]  His nose is like growing 50 feet long.
[01:22:21.523 --> 01:22:23.124]  This is just unbelievable, man.
[01:22:24.404 --> 01:22:26.005]  People's televisions every single day.
[01:22:28.697 --> 01:22:31.678]  And these challenges get people worried.
[01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:34.578]  And it frays our civic trust.
[01:22:38.079 --> 01:22:42.000]  And it makes a lot of people feel like the fix is in.
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:43.200]  And the game is rigged.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.121]  And nobody's looking out for them.
[01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:47.341]  Except Trump.
[01:22:48.081 --> 01:22:52.342]  Especially those communities outside our big urban centers.
[01:22:52.622 --> 01:22:53.482]  Rigged by this guy.
[01:22:55.202 --> 01:22:57.823]  And even though your generation is the most diverse in history,
[01:22:59.901 --> 01:23:04.304]  You're taking their basic freedoms.
[01:23:04.564 --> 01:23:07.346]  That's your new freedom is your diversity, not any real wealth or freedom.
[01:23:07.366 --> 01:23:08.567]  Like you do in Communist China.
[01:23:08.587 --> 01:23:10.889]  He goes to South America and says, you can't be wealthy.
[01:23:10.909 --> 01:23:13.010]  He goes to Africa and says that.
[01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:14.291]  Those are the dark past.
[01:23:14.311 --> 01:23:17.874]  So you can't be part of America.
[01:23:17.894 --> 01:23:18.654]  That's what he's saying.
[01:23:29.633 --> 01:23:31.013]  Pitting one group against another.
[01:23:31.033 --> 01:23:32.054]  That's what you do.
[01:23:32.534 --> 01:23:42.156]  Telling people that order and security will be restored if it weren't for those who don't look like us or don't sound like us.
[01:23:42.176 --> 01:23:44.076]  No, you're letting criminals in and not vetting people.
[01:23:44.896 --> 01:23:46.296]  People get checked when they go to his house.
[01:23:46.757 --> 01:23:47.717]  There's security at his house.
[01:23:47.897 --> 01:23:49.057]  Listen, he's fumbling though, Alex.
[01:23:49.317 --> 01:23:50.077]  We can't have a border.
[01:23:52.198 --> 01:23:54.558]  And in a healthy democracy, it doesn't work.
[01:23:56.739 --> 01:23:58.039]  Our antibodies kick in.
[01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:02.112]  Oh, and ban all the free speech?
[01:24:02.392 --> 01:24:04.734]  Call out the bigots and the fear mongers.
[01:24:05.074 --> 01:24:08.056]  That's all they do is call people racists that aren't.
[01:24:08.096 --> 01:24:12.459]  Because they're the racist race baiters.
[01:24:16.562 --> 01:24:25.348]  But when there's a vacuum in our democracy, when we don't vote, when we take our basic rights and freedoms for granted,
[01:24:29.468 --> 01:24:31.609]  When we turn away and stop paying attention.
[01:24:31.809 --> 01:24:33.690]  The factories come back, the jobs come back.
[01:24:33.710 --> 01:24:34.391]  Stop engaging.
[01:24:34.891 --> 01:24:36.632]  Double the number of blacks vote for Trump.
[01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:37.932]  Yeah, he's scared.
[01:24:38.212 --> 01:24:38.893]  He's really scared.
[01:24:38.913 --> 01:24:44.836]  We're looking for the newest diversion, the electronic versions of bread and circuses.
[01:24:47.031 --> 01:24:47.952]  Oh, that was very telling.
[01:24:47.992 --> 01:24:49.953]  The electronic versions of bread and circuses.
[01:24:50.193 --> 01:24:51.554]  That's what corporate media is.
[01:24:51.995 --> 01:24:53.756]  That's what all the brainwashing is.
[01:24:53.796 --> 01:25:02.582]  So this is right when the propaganda, though, for some reason our stream is cut here, but this is right when the propaganda, Alex, starts going next level.
[01:25:02.902 --> 01:25:10.828]  And the average American, normally the smooth-talking propagandist, snake-tongued Obama, could trick the average American with a speech like this.
[01:25:10.868 --> 01:25:16.472]  But he's lost his swagger, he's clearly frazzled, he's been in hiding, and I think we know why.
[01:25:19.124 --> 01:25:22.347]  Because they'd artificially sold the country out and had external tariffs set up.
[01:25:22.447 --> 01:25:23.608]  Like he had taxed the tax cut.
[01:25:23.668 --> 01:25:26.270]  China had a 15% tax on corporations.
[01:25:26.311 --> 01:25:28.152]  We had a 40, so everybody moved there.
[01:25:28.432 --> 01:25:30.014]  Trump goes to 15 to match him.
[01:25:30.274 --> 01:25:31.355]  That's fair trade.
[01:25:32.176 --> 01:25:33.377]  He goes to 40 to match him.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.001]  China goes to zero.
[01:25:39.542 --> 01:25:40.824]  And so Apple and Google move there.
[01:25:41.684 --> 01:25:44.767]  But he's saying it's bad that we're even being competitive.
[01:25:45.228 --> 01:25:45.588]  Continue.
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.881]  Then other voices fill the void.
[01:25:55.502 --> 01:25:58.964]  A politics of fear, and resentment, and retrenchment takes hold.
[01:25:59.184 --> 01:26:00.544]  That's what they push for the universities.
[01:26:00.785 --> 01:26:02.585]  He's the one telling you you should be scared if you're not white.
[01:26:02.605 --> 01:26:02.985]  That's him.
[01:26:03.145 --> 01:26:04.066]  Complex problems.
[01:26:05.646 --> 01:26:07.227]  No promise to fight for the little guy.
[01:26:07.747 --> 01:26:09.988]  Even as they cater to the wealthiest and most powerful.
[01:26:10.688 --> 01:26:11.049]  That's him.
[01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:14.510]  No promise to clean up corruption.
[01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:16.271]  This is why people left Obama.
[01:26:19.462 --> 01:26:22.585]  They start undermining norms that ensure accountability.
[01:26:24.267 --> 01:26:27.830]  And try to change the rules to entrench their power further.
[01:26:29.272 --> 01:26:32.175]  Oh, that means he won't let them sell out to Russia or China.
[01:26:32.275 --> 01:26:34.778]  Wait, you mean like signing the NDAA to legalize propaganda?
[01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:35.038]  Yeah.
[01:26:35.338 --> 01:26:36.319]  To entrench your power further?
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:37.500]  That was Trump, right?
[01:26:37.761 --> 01:26:40.744]  No, that was Obama putting a CIA group in to take us off air.
[01:26:40.904 --> 01:26:41.624]  Oh, so that was Obama.
[01:26:45.373 --> 01:26:51.257]  I understand this is not just a matter of Democrats vs. Republicans or Liberals vs. Conservatives.
[01:26:51.337 --> 01:26:55.740]  And he's the one that also illegally spied on Trump during the campaign and after and got caught lying about it.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:56.201]  That's right.
[01:26:56.941 --> 01:26:58.182]  Very Nixonian.
[01:26:58.322 --> 01:26:58.923]  Caught red-handed.
[01:26:59.023 --> 01:26:59.563]  Both parties.
[01:27:04.366 --> 01:27:06.868]  Southern Democrats were the bigger defenders of slavery.
[01:27:08.449 --> 01:27:08.729]  Wow.
[01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:10.030]  One thing he said was true.
[01:27:10.050 --> 01:27:13.713]  He took a Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, to end it.
[01:27:14.585 --> 01:27:15.606]  We've been saying that for years.
[01:27:17.567 --> 01:27:19.407]  Dixiecrats filibustered anti-legislation.
[01:27:19.447 --> 01:27:22.149]  That shows how they're grabbing all our rhetoric because they know we're winning.
[01:27:22.169 --> 01:27:23.309]  Next he goes to status quo.
[01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:41.499]  And although it was a Democratic president and a Majority Democrat Congress spurred on by young marchers and protesters, they got the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act over the finish line, those historic laws also got passed because
[01:27:42.771 --> 01:27:47.532]  Of the leadership of Republicans, like Illinois' own Everett Dirksen.
[01:27:48.412 --> 01:27:49.012]  Illinois?
[01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:51.613]  Oh, they're gonna be mad at him for that.
[01:27:51.853 --> 01:27:54.653]  So neither party has had a monopoly on wisdom.
[01:27:54.693 --> 01:27:54.893]  Yeah.
[01:27:55.413 --> 01:27:55.993]  Even I know that.
[01:27:57.374 --> 01:28:02.735]  Neither party has been exclusively responsible for us going backwards instead of forward.
[01:28:02.755 --> 01:28:06.635]  So he's attacking Dinesh D'Souza's truth that it was Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act.
[01:28:06.875 --> 01:28:08.416]  He acted like, oh they helped a little.
[01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:09.956]  No, you're a damn liar!
[01:28:12.403 --> 01:28:15.026]  We hear a plague on both your houses.
[01:28:15.486 --> 01:28:17.529]  I think only like a handful of Democrats voted for it.
[01:28:17.549 --> 01:28:19.230]  You could pull up the famous vote.
[01:28:20.191 --> 01:28:21.653]  They fought it even after the vote.
[01:28:21.673 --> 01:28:23.235]  Oh look, he just gave a little bit of credit though.
[01:28:23.255 --> 01:28:24.556]  There were a few Republicans for it.
[01:28:24.816 --> 01:28:26.418]  That's a nest of Susan that I put in jail.
[01:28:26.438 --> 01:28:28.220]  You know, maybe there was some accuracy in his film.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.902]  Jim Thompson was governor.
[01:28:32.264 --> 01:28:34.165]  Got a lot of good Republican friends here.
[01:28:34.205 --> 01:28:37.006]  You just wait until Obama starts talking about Nazis.
[01:28:37.026 --> 01:28:37.526]  Thank you, Obama.
[01:28:37.566 --> 01:28:39.407]  I think Obama may have just cost the Democrats a blue wave.
[01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:41.508]  He basically says it's like pregnancy.
[01:28:41.528 --> 01:28:42.248]  He goes, I was pregnant.
[01:28:42.288 --> 01:28:44.569]  It just took longer and now the baby's... we've had the baby.
[01:29:02.321 --> 01:29:09.066]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.

[01:29:56.477 --> 01:29:59.019]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:02.382 --> 01:30:06.845]  Alpha Power Vital Male Androgen Biosynthesis Promoter.
[01:30:06.965 --> 01:30:14.951]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[01:30:15.332 --> 01:30:16.933]  But here's what you want to know.
[01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:23.874]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[01:30:24.534 --> 01:30:28.057]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:36.960]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:45.224]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:49.786]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[01:30:50.366 --> 01:30:54.308]  It's Alpha Power and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[01:30:55.403 --> 01:31:10.258]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[01:31:10.679 --> 01:31:16.004]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[01:31:16.344 --> 01:31:17.886]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[01:31:18.186 --> 01:31:19.507]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[01:31:19.527 --> 01:31:21.729]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with all the power.
[01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:24.131]  Because I said, I want to dominate the industry.
[01:31:24.671 --> 01:31:28.974]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[01:31:28.994 --> 01:31:30.315]  I'm going to explain this, because this is critical.
[01:31:31.156 --> 01:31:37.380]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[01:31:37.781 --> 01:31:39.822]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[01:31:40.423 --> 01:31:42.004]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[01:31:42.024 --> 01:31:43.365]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[01:31:43.425 --> 01:31:44.846]  You've got marketing other costs that go in.
[01:31:47.748 --> 01:31:48.609]  But here's an example.
[01:31:49.409 --> 01:31:57.015]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[01:31:57.035 --> 01:31:58.736]  It just has a little bit in it.
[01:31:59.216 --> 01:32:05.381]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[01:32:06.061 --> 01:32:11.145]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[01:32:11.445 --> 01:32:19.791]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product, in them.
[01:32:20.191 --> 01:32:21.212]  Nobody else does that.
[01:32:21.292 --> 01:32:23.974]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[01:32:24.494 --> 01:32:34.221]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in
[01:32:34.241 --> 01:32:40.645]  Again, quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[01:32:41.025 --> 01:32:49.991]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the globalists, a 360 win.
[01:32:50.011 --> 01:32:52.372]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[01:32:52.752 --> 01:32:58.476]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsTore.com by calling toll free, triple A, 253-3139.
[01:32:58.496 --> 01:32:59.076]  A total 360 win.
[01:33:06.363 --> 01:33:10.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.551 --> 01:33:28.357]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:29.117 --> 01:33:30.598]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.039 --> 01:33:31.259]  Show!
[01:33:35.814 --> 01:33:38.336]  CNN is very famous for bullying people.
[01:33:38.356 --> 01:33:46.664]  A woman receives abuse, threats of violence that CNN tracks down, publicly shames her for sharing a Russian event on Facebook, which it wasn't a Russian event.
[01:33:47.425 --> 01:33:51.188]  A Russian bot posted a link on her Facebook page.
[01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:53.530]  And again, you can go hire Russian bots.
[01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:55.852]  You can hire Australian bots, Brazilian bots.
[01:33:56.292 --> 01:33:57.654]  The most bots come out of the U.S.
[01:33:58.034 --> 01:33:59.315]  and Canada and England.
[01:34:00.876 --> 01:34:02.917]  This is in China, but remember that?
[01:34:03.598 --> 01:34:09.540]  CNN blackmails source of Donald Trump wrestling video to come out and apologize or they would dox them.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:10.080]  Remember all that?
[01:34:10.501 --> 01:34:24.447]  But CNN's Oliver Darcy has had me banned, he's a public figure and a man, for confronting him at the Capitol and saying, how dare you lobby to have us taken off these platforms and attack our sponsors and go around and police things.
[01:34:26.499 --> 01:34:30.180]  And then he just arrogantly went and complained and they said, you're blown out the airlock.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.602]  And of course, they then all worked with mainstream media to announce why I was banned.
[01:34:35.142 --> 01:34:37.263]  All nebulous saying that I was bullying.
[01:34:37.323 --> 01:34:42.804]  Yes, full grown adults at the Capitol that have literally been racketeering against me and bullying me.
[01:34:42.824 --> 01:34:46.186]  I knew when I did that, he'd do that.
[01:34:46.206 --> 01:34:47.306]  I even said it after I left.
[01:34:47.326 --> 01:34:48.546]  I think I even said it on the tape.
[01:34:50.087 --> 01:34:52.828]  In fact, I said, I bet I'll be banned for bullying this guy that bullied me.
[01:34:54.477 --> 01:34:55.977]  Because it's all subjective.
[01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:56.617]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:34:56.677 --> 01:34:58.058]  The guy gets a hundred retweets.
[01:34:58.538 --> 01:35:03.559]  He has the whole power of CNN behind him that no one watches to try to get viewers.
[01:35:03.619 --> 01:35:04.339]  And he doesn't.
[01:35:04.479 --> 01:35:05.239]  He's a joke.
[01:35:06.499 --> 01:35:07.719]  And that whole system's coming down.
[01:35:07.739 --> 01:35:08.219]  But look at this.
[01:35:08.959 --> 01:35:11.720]  In the U.S., a lot of twisted people have access to guns.
[01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:15.441]  That's why Alex Jones Infowars were too dangerous not to be banned.
[01:35:18.321 --> 01:35:19.461]  That's Yahoo News.
[01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:23.542]  And he called Darcy to his face a rat.
[01:35:24.804 --> 01:35:27.386]  Well, that's what he is, going around tattling, lying, evil.
[01:35:28.707 --> 01:35:30.428]  I said, you're like the Hitler Youth.
[01:35:30.448 --> 01:35:32.289]  Well, the left constantly calls us Nazis.
[01:35:34.291 --> 01:35:43.877]  Jones made negative references to his eyes, which was remarkably mild, slightly bemused to me when I watched it, and accused him of smiling like a possum that climbed out of the rear end of a dead cow.
[01:35:44.778 --> 01:35:46.840]  They said all sorts of stuff like that about me on Comedy Central.
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:47.760]  It's a great description.
[01:35:48.821 --> 01:35:54.245]  But the point is, this guy goes around lobbying to have me taken down and then lies to our face with pure arrogance.
[01:35:55.882 --> 01:36:05.521]  And it's, oh my God, take the guns away, take the free speech away, because Jones is a bully and is going to get people shot.
[01:36:06.943 --> 01:36:07.263]  Wow!
[01:36:07.664 --> 01:36:17.390]  Well that banned video is in the video feed at InfoWars.com and it's linked on the story on DrudgeReport.com right in the middle column where it says Alex Jones.
[01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:18.891]  They're trying to shut us up.
[01:36:19.172 --> 01:36:24.355]  You can go see all the banned videos that are now going viral and see for yourself.
[01:36:25.016 --> 01:36:26.517]  You see the monster!
[01:36:27.588 --> 01:36:53.784]  That wrote more than 30 articles that called publishers and got people fired that were even talking about publishing a book that I was doing, and runs around saying, look, this violates this, this violates that, and then they've been ordered at Twitter by the Democrats and others that when these fact-checkers, Darcy testified, Jack Dorsey testified about that, when God calls, when Oliver Darcy calls,
[01:36:55.481 --> 01:36:55.901]  It's over.
[01:36:56.041 --> 01:36:56.962]  You just ban it.
[01:36:57.002 --> 01:36:57.582]  You just do it.
[01:36:57.603 --> 01:37:03.246]  I want to go back to this Obama clip where he really gets into the whoppers here in just a moment, but this is where we are.
[01:37:03.767 --> 01:37:05.568]  Now, we're building our own YouTube.
[01:37:05.608 --> 01:37:07.709]  Mike Adams has built his own Real.Video.
[01:37:08.130 --> 01:37:17.656]  We're doing a lot of big things, but really the power to resist these globalists is that I'm going to announce sometime this afternoon at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:17.676 --> 01:37:18.617]  You got to go there to see it.
[01:37:22.216 --> 01:37:36.470]  That a time I'm gonna do a special live internet-only transmission tomorrow, the first, where it's just our streams and just our feed, and it'll send a notification to the free Android or iPhone app at InfoWars.com forward slash app, InfoWars official.
[01:37:37.791 --> 01:37:42.336]  And the power of you to then say an hour or two before, hey, he's about to go live.
[01:37:42.396 --> 01:37:46.660]  Let's say I'm gonna go live at four o'clock tomorrow with critical intel.
[01:37:48.206 --> 01:37:55.327]  You can tell everybody, hey, go get the app, the Verboten app at InfoWars.com forward slash app, or just go to InfoWars.com.
[01:37:56.647 --> 01:37:59.308]  It'll be on the front page of the site tomorrow.
[01:38:00.148 --> 01:38:06.869]  And I'm going to have some special guests and things like that and some big explosive news that just like I told you on Tuesday, hey, Wednesday, you want to tune in.
[01:38:07.209 --> 01:38:07.949]  Did I not deliver?
[01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:09.310]  Okay.
[01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:11.070]  And then I said, tune in tomorrow.
[01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:12.030]  You'll have giant news.
[01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:13.570]  And it did not get crazy on Thursday.
[01:38:14.150 --> 01:38:17.931]  And I've got even bigger news that I'm not at liberty to cover yet, but we're going to cover it tomorrow.
[01:38:19.781 --> 01:38:22.322]  I made the decision to go public with it before I go to the FBI.
[01:38:23.103 --> 01:38:25.084]  So that's what's going on here.
[01:38:25.844 --> 01:38:26.644]  Mueller made his move.
[01:38:27.305 --> 01:38:29.446]  We have got incredible information.
[01:38:29.466 --> 01:38:33.748]  All I want to say is thank you, Matt Drudge, for caring about America and having courage.
[01:38:34.268 --> 01:38:39.871]  And thank you for being the only organization and group that has had our back and had the courage to be a trailblazer for 10 years.
[01:38:41.011 --> 01:38:48.853]  And what you've done, outside of our audience, and outside of God, and outside of this crew and my family, Matt Drudge is the key stone to this.
[01:38:49.613 --> 01:38:57.915]  And Matt Drudge is an American hero, and an icon, and a true maverick, a trailblazer, a game-changer.
[01:38:58.435 --> 01:39:01.456]  And without him, InfoWars would have been defeated long ago.
[01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:03.377]  So he's under attack.
[01:39:03.798 --> 01:39:06.820]  Go to his site, click on his sponsors, pray for him, support him.
[01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:09.323]  Matt Drudge is a one in a billion.
[01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:13.547]  He is an absolute game changer.
[01:39:14.327 --> 01:39:17.811]  And there's a lot of talk in this world, but let me tell you, that's the game changer right there.
[01:39:18.191 --> 01:39:19.392]  You, the viewers, the game changer.
[01:39:19.532 --> 01:39:22.095]  And it's true.
[01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:29.054]  We're bringing in as much money for August and September as we've ever brought in.
[01:39:29.754 --> 01:39:36.199]  But I have a bigger crew, I have Soros financing a bunch of lawsuits that I can beat if I can finance fighting.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.341]  Hands down, we will win them.
[01:39:39.081 --> 01:39:50.010]  The stuff they're doing is not in law, no matter how much emotion or lies or propaganda, or how much they try to try it in the press, we've already got a bunch of them thrown out, but we got big top law firms that bankrupted Remington, you name it, coming after us.
[01:39:51.252 --> 01:39:58.836]  If you buy the products that you already need and steadfastly support us, I promise you I will never compromise or back down or give in.
[01:39:59.116 --> 01:40:00.177]  I'll never compromise anyways.
[01:40:00.197 --> 01:40:01.077]  They could have a gun to my head.
[01:40:01.397 --> 01:40:02.038]  I wouldn't sell out.
[01:40:02.138 --> 01:40:07.801]  But, you know, at a certain point, the soul is willing but the flesh is weak.
[01:40:09.262 --> 01:40:11.363]  But you have my trillion percent
[01:40:12.492 --> 01:40:12.952]  Commitment.
[01:40:13.652 --> 01:40:17.234]  That I'm never gonna back down or never falter or waver as much as I can.
[01:40:17.314 --> 01:40:21.935]  But literally, you buying products is like giving somebody in a desert hike water or food.
[01:40:23.056 --> 01:40:24.096]  These are products you need.
[01:40:24.136 --> 01:40:26.517]  So the Labor Day specials are extended throughout this weekend and then they're over.
[01:40:27.037 --> 01:40:29.318]  And we're talking 50% off on all our best sellers.
[01:40:30.626 --> 01:40:31.627]  These are great products you need.
[01:40:31.647 --> 01:40:33.127]  The t-shirts are the best we've ever had.
[01:40:33.147 --> 01:40:33.928]  The best fabric.
[01:40:34.248 --> 01:40:35.088]  The best quality.
[01:40:35.188 --> 01:40:35.989]  So many designs.
[01:40:36.069 --> 01:40:37.730]  So many great ways to spread the word.
[01:40:38.050 --> 01:40:42.772]  But if you get things like coffee or supplements that you're going to want every 15 days, every month, every two months.
[01:40:43.112 --> 01:40:44.373]  It goes all the way out to like a year.
[01:40:44.413 --> 01:40:46.454]  You can sign up for auto ship out to a year.
[01:40:46.754 --> 01:40:48.155]  Cancel anytime it's free.
[01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:49.596]  There's 5% Patriot points on top of it.
[01:40:49.616 --> 01:40:52.537]  10% off when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:40:52.597 --> 01:40:54.598]  Free shipping on order for $50 or more.
[01:40:54.638 --> 01:40:55.619]  There's so many specials.
[01:40:55.659 --> 01:40:58.180]  So many deals that a lot of these products we don't make money on.
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.161]  I mean Patriot Blend.
[01:40:59.901 --> 01:41:01.062]  Coffee cost me like $12.
[01:41:01.282 --> 01:41:03.944]  And it's a good deal at $17.95.
[01:41:04.364 --> 01:41:07.926]  I mean, they sell the exact same stuff in Whole Foods for $25.
[01:41:08.867 --> 01:41:11.429]  So, one thing we need to do is probably raise prices.
[01:41:11.469 --> 01:41:12.750]  I just love to give you a great deal.
[01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:16.472]  It's got 700 plus reviews on Power Reviews.
[01:41:16.812 --> 01:41:17.293]  97% positive.
[01:41:17.353 --> 01:41:19.734]  It's just a high quality, high quality medium roast.
[01:41:19.754 --> 01:41:23.277]  We have several others as well from the Chiapas farmers.
[01:41:23.757 --> 01:41:25.398]  Basically, it's right on the border with Guatemala.
[01:41:25.538 --> 01:41:26.519]  It is amazing.
[01:41:26.819 --> 01:41:27.680]  Welcome to America Coffee.
[01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:29.441]  That's something you want to order every month?
[01:41:30.615 --> 01:41:36.541]  And just doing that, reordering the Super Blue Toothpaste Fluoride Free, Coal Silver Fortified, Iodine Fortified.
[01:41:37.161 --> 01:41:37.982]  Get that back in.
[01:41:38.042 --> 01:41:39.483]  It's great concentrated toothpaste.
[01:41:39.543 --> 01:41:41.065]  Yeah, we make like three or four bucks on that.
[01:41:43.223 --> 01:41:45.184]  But it's the ultimate turmeric bodies.
[01:41:45.244 --> 01:41:46.845]  It's the fish oil for you and your children.
[01:41:47.265 --> 01:41:49.626]  All these are the best quality products out there.
[01:41:49.706 --> 01:41:53.068]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[01:41:53.108 --> 01:41:59.771]  Now we have Dr. Steve Pchenik coming up later to give us his take on these bans and the election.
[01:41:59.791 --> 01:42:00.851]  60 days out and more.
[01:42:00.871 --> 01:42:02.672]  Owen's going to be riding shotgun with me.
[01:42:03.432 --> 01:42:08.174]  We have another gentleman who's running for Senate against the fake Indian Pocahontas Show.
[01:42:08.615 --> 01:42:10.576]  We've got Sheba for Senate joining us.
[01:42:11.636 --> 01:42:12.276]  And so much more.
[01:42:12.296 --> 01:42:15.918]  I didn't get to the really bad parts of Obama yet, but I'll do that with Pchenik.
[01:42:16.318 --> 01:42:26.402]  And when we upload this to Infowars.com, from the point we were at, let's just make a note where it gets to the real whoppers, where he says, Trump didn't do the economy, I did it, America still sucks, America's KKK.
[01:42:26.422 --> 01:42:27.643]  I mean, it is...
[01:42:29.264 --> 01:42:30.424]  Crazy, yeah.
[01:42:30.664 --> 01:42:32.785]  You've got Clinton, most blacks in jail.
[01:42:32.825 --> 01:42:35.586]  Says their animals must be brought to heel like super predators.
[01:42:36.006 --> 01:42:37.266]  Most blacks on welfare.
[01:42:37.626 --> 01:42:38.346]  That's Obama.
[01:42:38.987 --> 01:42:40.487]  So Clinton's most blacks in jail.
[01:42:41.187 --> 01:42:42.768]  Obama's most blacks on welfare.
[01:42:43.028 --> 01:42:46.128]  And Trump is most blacks with jobs and highest wages ever.
[01:42:46.809 --> 01:42:47.569]  Just a fact.
[01:42:47.949 --> 01:42:50.490]  Delivering the goods, like he's always done.
[01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:51.330]  That's what he does.
[01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:53.710]  Faithful and truthful servant, Donald Trump.
[01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:55.891]  And we are your faithful and truthful servants as well.
[01:42:56.492 --> 01:42:57.657]  Straight ahead, more.
[01:42:57.677 --> 01:42:58.280]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:42:59.224]  Spread those live links.
[01:42:59.244 --> 01:43:00.128]  That's how you defeat the censors.
[01:43:04.534 --> 01:43:14.862]  I think what Google and what others are doing, if you look at what's going on at Twitter, if you look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you can't do that to people.
[01:43:15.002 --> 01:43:15.502]  You can't do it.
[01:43:15.542 --> 01:43:22.787]  We have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in and you just can't do that.
[01:43:22.927 --> 01:43:25.990]  So I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook
[01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:30.895]  They're really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful.
[01:43:30.955 --> 01:43:34.499]  It's not fair to large portions of the population.
[01:43:34.719 --> 01:43:36.621]  And so you guys, I'll tell you this.
[01:43:36.901 --> 01:43:44.090]  I'd give us a 60-40 chance we win the midterms, and you guys get totally devastated and indicted for this, because the quarter's not being given now.
[01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:45.111]  You guys pushed too far.
[01:43:45.451 --> 01:43:46.973]  You went after Trump's family, all of it.
[01:43:50.063 --> 01:43:59.450]  But even if you were to steal the election to get through, I've looked at every possible destination along your planned permutations in your entire operation.
[01:43:59.591 --> 01:44:00.892]  And I've looked at every outcome.
[01:44:00.932 --> 01:44:03.674]  And let me just say this, there isn't any outcome where you win.
[01:44:09.358 --> 01:44:11.660]  And I haven't even laughed because I know you don't like it.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.402]  Because I can, you know, act just like the enemy.
[01:44:13.442 --> 01:44:16.644]  But the point is, is that you guys think you're going to execute this.
[01:44:16.845 --> 01:44:18.326]  You're not going to execute crap.
[01:44:19.667 --> 01:44:24.531]  And the globalists know I don't just make statements on air that aren't true or that aren't backed up.
[01:44:24.671 --> 01:44:26.433]  You are facing hammer war.
[01:44:26.533 --> 01:44:27.994]  You are bringing down the gates.
[01:44:28.074 --> 01:44:30.616]  You think taking down these controls is destroying us?
[01:44:30.696 --> 01:44:34.460]  You are removing gates that we don't remove because we know who we are.
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:41.846]  But once you remove the gates, once you let us in, we will visit judgment on you politically, economically, culturally.
[01:44:45.708 --> 01:44:47.089]  Because you know it's judgment.
[01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:48.991]  It's judgment day.
[01:44:49.831 --> 01:44:50.932]  Judgment day cometh.
[01:44:51.733 --> 01:44:53.734]  Judgment day is so close.
[01:44:54.235 --> 01:44:55.436]  And justice is good.
[01:44:55.856 --> 01:44:56.957]  Justice is right.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.864]  We just want to have our families and live and have prosperity, but you've got to control the prosperity.
[01:45:12.133 --> 01:45:13.774]  Things will never run our lives.
[01:45:14.114 --> 01:45:18.075]  So now, you have summoned us to destroy you politically.
[01:45:19.016 --> 01:45:25.358]  You have gone to the altar, and you've prayed on gods, ancient gods.
[01:45:25.858 --> 01:45:28.599]  You've summoned the Titans, and they will arrive.

[01:47:06.369 --> 01:47:08.991]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.974 --> 01:47:33.665]  I want to say something that is very, very important here, and I don't know how to say it is the problem.
[01:47:34.606 --> 01:47:38.671]  I feel like we get up here and we laugh and we joke a little too much, and I'm not blaming you, I'm not blaming me.
[01:47:39.687 --> 01:47:43.912]  But as patriots, as rugged individualists, we're pretty tough.
[01:47:44.372 --> 01:47:50.059]  The left is good at whining and bitching and complaining and, you know, they're having testimony, people saying, Trump's killing me!
[01:47:50.359 --> 01:47:51.881]  Kavanaugh's killing me!
[01:47:52.602 --> 01:47:53.883]  It's all this drama-queening.
[01:47:54.083 --> 01:47:54.944]  He's Hitler!
[01:47:55.124 --> 01:47:55.845]  Oh, we're all dead!
[01:47:55.865 --> 01:47:58.749]  Meanwhile, they're literally funded by George Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[01:47:59.653 --> 01:48:04.636]  But thousands and thousands of prominent libertarians and conservatives have all been banned.
[01:48:05.216 --> 01:48:13.862]  They ban me off Twitter and say because I bullied people when it's Darcy, this CNN guy that's getting me banned everywhere.
[01:48:13.882 --> 01:48:14.582]  He's a monster.
[01:48:14.762 --> 01:48:15.703]  He's a full-grown man.
[01:48:15.943 --> 01:48:16.884]  He's on national TV.
[01:48:17.084 --> 01:48:20.306]  I get in his face and I say, you are a liar and a fraud and anti-free speech.
[01:48:20.666 --> 01:48:21.346]  How dare you?
[01:48:21.787 --> 01:48:22.367]  Full-grown man.
[01:48:22.427 --> 01:48:23.448]  And they have articles going.
[01:48:24.148 --> 01:48:27.251]  In the U.S., a lot of twisted people have access to guns.
[01:48:27.311 --> 01:48:30.393]  That's why Alex Jones InfoWars were too dangerous not to be banned.
[01:48:30.894 --> 01:48:36.579]  He compared Darcy, the CNN journalist, Oliver Darcy, to Hitler Youth.
[01:48:37.559 --> 01:48:39.901]  And I said, you're like the Last Stringer.
[01:48:40.362 --> 01:48:41.062]  You're horrible.
[01:48:41.623 --> 01:48:42.424]  You're low quality.
[01:48:43.706 --> 01:48:48.908]  And the Globalist propped CNN up to stop, you know, the Allies' advance on Berlin like Hitler Youth.
[01:48:49.409 --> 01:48:50.689]  I was saying, you're being used.
[01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:52.790]  It was a very nuanced, literary thing.
[01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:55.051]  It wasn't like, you're a Nazi, go to hell!
[01:48:55.791 --> 01:48:59.313]  Hell, Twitter would give you an award for that if I'd said that to some conservative.
[01:48:59.893 --> 01:49:01.994]  So everything they do, they claim we're doing.
[01:49:02.214 --> 01:49:08.437]  So I'm banned because I talk bad to the guy that got us banned everywhere.
[01:49:09.758 --> 01:49:13.320]  Because I'm claiming he got me banned, which is true, so now I'm banned for daring to talk to him.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:18.562]  And then they all colluded and knew it was going to happen hours before and wrote articles and admit they were colluding on it.
[01:49:18.922 --> 01:49:20.423]  That is crazy.
[01:49:20.643 --> 01:49:21.943]  It's also been put in the London Independent.
[01:49:22.363 --> 01:49:31.287]  So they're now combining the First Amendment with the Second Amendment and saying, take them both.
[01:49:31.467 --> 01:49:33.728]  Now, our next guest has been hit with exactly this.
[01:49:34.048 --> 01:49:37.190]  He's showing nicely in the polls, Shiva.
[01:49:38.237 --> 01:49:43.858]  Idyaray is our guest, and it's vasheva.com.
[01:49:44.758 --> 01:49:48.679]  It's centralsheba4senate.com.
[01:49:48.719 --> 01:49:51.840]  He'll give us the best websites, but everybody knows who he is.
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:52.420]  He's been on the show.
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.960]  He's the inventor of email, on record.
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:56.801]  He's a big engineer, big scientist, MIT, whole nine yards.
[01:49:57.401 --> 01:50:02.722]  And he has been barred, or they're trying to bar him from the debates, because the fake Indian, Pocahontas,
[01:50:03.562 --> 01:50:07.646]  Cannot have the real thing there, a businessman, to confront her.
[01:50:07.726 --> 01:50:10.869]  So, great to have you here during this great season of banning.
[01:50:11.249 --> 01:50:18.736]  You're, I know, having to sue to be part of the debate because she doesn't want to actually stand on the battlefield of ideas like an authoritarian leftist.
[01:50:19.056 --> 01:50:20.598]  She wants to shut down your speech.
[01:50:21.338 --> 01:50:22.580]  So, thanks for joining us, Shiva.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:23.821]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:50:23.941 --> 01:50:25.963]  Basically, Whitey doesn't want Darky on the stage.
[01:50:27.585 --> 01:50:29.165]  Well, let's break that down.
[01:50:29.185 --> 01:50:32.146]  Because if I say it, the media will clip it out and say I said it to you.
[01:50:32.466 --> 01:50:33.147]  What are you saying?
[01:50:34.207 --> 01:50:39.528]  Well, what I mean by that, Alex, is Elizabeth Warren claims she's for blacks and minorities and poor, right?
[01:50:40.369 --> 01:50:52.072]  And here you have a minority, you know, as someone who came through the legal immigrant process, struggled as it went through the American journey, education,
[01:50:53.132 --> 01:50:55.634]  Innovation, immigration, all those processes.
[01:50:56.115 --> 01:50:59.458]  And I would consider myself an embodiment of the American dream.
[01:50:59.518 --> 01:51:07.746]  Elizabeth Warren needs to step aside and let a real American worker, a real inventor, an educator really represent the state and be a real part of the U.S.
[01:51:07.786 --> 01:51:08.066]  Senate.
[01:51:08.126 --> 01:51:12.751]  Instead, what she's doing is she's colluded with a fake Trumper, a guy called Dirty Deal,
[01:51:13.371 --> 01:51:21.276]  Who voted for Joe Biden, has a Saudi lobbyist as his campaign manager, and they colluded to not even invite me to the debates.
[01:51:21.476 --> 01:51:22.737]  I'm a bona fide candidate.
[01:51:22.977 --> 01:51:27.700]  You know, our volunteers who are here, we got 20,000 signatures to get on the ballot.
[01:51:28.461 --> 01:51:29.982]  We struggled out there.
[01:51:30.042 --> 01:51:31.262]  We played by the rules.
[01:51:31.663 --> 01:51:37.826]  And what Warren did was right after the primaries, in fact, midnight before the primary, she said, I will debate the Republican.
[01:51:37.846 --> 01:51:39.748]  Well, what about the darky Indian guy?
[01:51:39.848 --> 01:51:41.709]  Is he just a illegitimate?
[01:51:42.429 --> 01:51:44.050]  You know, quote unquote, bastard, right?
[01:51:44.630 --> 01:51:48.593]  So that's how they want to treat the American people, because this is not about me.
[01:51:48.633 --> 01:51:57.498]  It's the fact that the Republicans and Democrats in Massachusetts, by the way, there's only one party in Massachusetts, the Democrats, and they have another face called the Republicans.
[01:51:57.858 --> 01:52:07.564]  The guy that won the primary, again, I said this guy voted for Biden, switched from Republican to Democrat the same time Warren went from Democrat, I mean, Republican to Democrat.
[01:52:07.884 --> 01:52:09.405]  He went from Democrat to Republican.
[01:52:10.043 --> 01:52:14.365]  So what you have is you have a uniparty system and they really want to keep freedom of choice out.
[01:52:14.726 --> 01:52:17.967]  What we did, Alex, was I was thinking this was going to happen.
[01:52:18.007 --> 01:52:27.372]  So we sent a legal notice to the University of Massachusetts, which is a federally funded government institution, which will be hosting these three debates, which I'm excluded of.
[01:52:27.792 --> 01:52:38.458]  And we told them that's a violation of free speech because you can't really attack the private media companies, but you can expose the University of Massachusetts, by the way, which is run by a former Democrat
[01:52:38.838 --> 01:53:06.288]  One of the most corrupt politicians called Marty Meehan and so it's clear the Republicans and Democrats said we got to keep that darky real Indian off of the stage because he's gonna cause problems because you know when I'm on the stage Alex I'm gonna expose the hell out of her I'll mop the floor with her but she's put this fake trumper on there the fake Indian wants a fake trumper to mislead all the Massachusetts voters that he's a trumper to take it away from the real guy who's anti-establishment from the real
[01:53:08.101 --> 01:53:10.662]  So that's the insidious game, but we're not going to let him get away with it.
[01:53:10.722 --> 01:53:14.243]  Wednesday, if they don't put me on stage, Alex, we're going to file a federal lawsuit.
[01:53:14.283 --> 01:53:15.844]  And you know I do pretty well with lawsuits.
[01:53:17.465 --> 01:53:17.945]  That's right.
[01:53:19.085 --> 01:53:28.389]  Let's spend a few minutes talking about what you would say on the debate stage against her, what you would hit her with in your first opening three-minute statement.
[01:53:29.053 --> 01:53:32.475]  Well, the first thing I'd hit her with, and the other guys, the establishment is one.
[01:53:32.796 --> 01:53:37.259]  The Republicans and Democrats have been colluding against the working people of this country.
[01:53:37.659 --> 01:53:42.182]  I would hit her with the fact that, A, you voted for the Monsanto Protection Act.
[01:53:42.463 --> 01:53:43.543]  You voted yay for it.
[01:53:43.904 --> 01:53:46.886]  You voted to support corrupt defense contractors.
[01:53:46.926 --> 01:53:48.287]  You wanted to bomb Syria.
[01:53:48.747 --> 01:53:51.210]  And you wanted a bigger military budget than Trump.
[01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:52.531]  You're an imperialist globalist.
[01:53:52.771 --> 01:53:58.357]  And the third thing I'd hit her with very hard was that her Dodd-Frank destroyed 1,200 community banks.
[01:53:58.757 --> 01:54:01.720]  That she is not a champion of everyday working people.
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:03.201]  She's not a champion of the poor.
[01:54:03.542 --> 01:54:05.624]  She has created segregation in Massachusetts.
[01:54:05.664 --> 01:54:12.010]  The average net worth of a black person is $8, and the average net worth of a poor white
[01:54:12.090 --> 01:54:12.350]  I think?
[01:54:27.993 --> 01:54:29.535]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:54:49.045 --> 01:54:54.110]  That's exactly what they're doing on the censorship against us, because a lot of the Republicans are for it, like Marco Rubio.
[01:54:54.130 --> 01:54:59.435]  What do you think about what's happened to me and thousands of other prominent conservative leaders and millions of people?
[01:54:59.455 --> 01:55:03.218]  As Trump said, there is a total crackdown 60 days out.
[01:55:03.318 --> 01:55:04.079]  It's outrageous.
[01:55:04.139 --> 01:55:05.280]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:08.263]  I know he's readying an arsenal of action.
[01:55:09.008 --> 01:55:12.410]  First, first of all, Alex, I thought the way you hit Rubio was awesome.
[01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:17.093]  You know, I don't think any other real journalist would have hit him like that.
[01:55:17.613 --> 01:55:22.956]  The guys that completes, as you know, I use this technical word called scumbag, and that's what Marco Rubio is.
[01:55:23.877 --> 01:55:25.938]  He's never stood for any principles but himself.
[01:55:25.978 --> 01:55:27.159]  So I thought what you did was great.
[01:55:27.559 --> 01:55:38.145]  Now, relative to what they've done to you and the attack on you, it's an attack on the foundation of the principles of this country, which was First Amendment, which was we have access to free discourse, free speech.
[01:55:38.525 --> 01:55:49.828]  And the reason the founder set that up is so you have an opportunity to have a whole range of views, so people can listen to a whole range of views, and they believe that people had a brain of their own so they could come to decisions.
[01:55:49.888 --> 01:55:56.510]  By trying to ban you, you know, leave people like me off the debate stage, they want to narrow it and control it.
[01:55:56.530 --> 01:55:57.911]  It's the centralization of power.
[01:55:57.931 --> 01:55:58.251]  No, I agree.
[01:55:58.271 --> 01:56:07.594]  And what do you think of the new role of the corporate press openly cheerleading to have everyone libertarian, everyone nationalist, everyone free market, removed, and then horrible
[01:56:08.454 --> 01:56:11.057]  Race baiting to make everyone fight with each other.
[01:56:11.077 --> 01:56:12.659]  This is so criminal.
[01:56:12.739 --> 01:56:13.780]  I think it's going to backfire.
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.022]  A. And then B. I want to hold you over and ask you.
[01:56:16.383 --> 01:56:17.304]  We played a lot of this earlier.
[01:56:17.564 --> 01:56:21.088]  Did you see Obama hours ago taking credit for the Trump economy?
[01:56:21.128 --> 01:56:22.149]  This is getting ridiculous.
[01:56:23.376 --> 01:56:28.201]  Yeah, well, look, Barack Obama, you know, he went to this place called Harvard Law School.
[01:56:28.221 --> 01:56:29.883]  You don't have to be that smart to go there.
[01:56:29.903 --> 01:56:32.026]  A lot of idiots go there.
[01:56:32.166 --> 01:56:38.253]  Obama has never created anything in his life, so obviously he wants to take credit for something because he's trying to rewrite his legacy.
[01:56:38.293 --> 01:56:39.354]  That's what Obama's about.
[01:56:39.654 --> 01:56:42.598]  That's what most of these so-called politicians are about.
[01:56:42.978 --> 01:56:45.841]  But at the fundamental level, Alex, we actually have a solution.
[01:56:46.901 --> 01:56:51.485]  And I've talked about it before on how we can actually overcome this attack on free speech.
[01:56:51.526 --> 01:56:52.887]  And maybe we should talk about it when we get back.
[01:56:52.927 --> 01:56:56.970]  But it's fundamentally using the framework of the institutions that the founders set up.
[01:56:57.431 --> 01:57:02.155]  One of them is called the United States Postal Service, which was actually set up to protect free speech.
[01:57:02.435 --> 01:57:14.767]  We need to resurrect that and really use that institution to offer what I call a federal digital service that will protect email, social media, that's a service by the people.
[01:57:14.787 --> 01:57:16.149]  Oh, you're showing a story, what you're talking about.
[01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:23.156]  They actually set the post office up because they wanted people to be able to accurately communicate because before the crown would manipulate mail and stuff.
[01:57:23.336 --> 01:57:23.636]  Exactly.
[01:57:24.117 --> 01:57:24.477]  Exactly.
[01:57:24.517 --> 01:57:26.438]  The Postal Service was set up.
[01:57:26.898 --> 01:57:29.580]  It was the teeth behind the First Amendment.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:35.944]  Up until 1970, nearly 70% of the... And it was the secret of the federal expansion, the whole country being formed.
[01:57:36.224 --> 01:57:39.506]  It was communications, and accurate communications, and fair communications.
[01:57:40.227 --> 01:57:43.249]  Sheba's so smart, we'll come back and talk about that and a lot more in the third hour.
[01:57:43.449 --> 01:57:46.811]  Whatever you do, share the live links, telephone to the local stations you're listening to.
[01:57:47.091 --> 01:57:49.573]  That's how we override Hillary and Soros.
[01:57:49.773 --> 01:57:50.934]  It's how we beat the enemy.
[01:57:53.035 --> 01:57:57.399]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:03.045]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[01:58:05.046 --> 01:58:08.129]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:10.752]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[01:58:14.622 --> 01:58:19.105]  Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[01:58:19.365 --> 01:58:23.909]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[01:58:24.209 --> 01:58:28.272]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[01:58:31.174 --> 01:58:34.256]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[01:58:45.254 --> 01:58:47.356]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[01:58:47.516 --> 01:58:52.380]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:54.221]  He's not a politician.
[01:58:55.042 --> 01:58:55.722]  He's one of us.
[01:58:58.224 --> 01:59:00.426]  Never, ever, ever give up.
[01:59:02.888 --> 01:59:05.370]  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider.
[01:59:06.110 --> 01:59:10.394]  Embrace that label, because it's the outsiders who change the world.
[01:59:11.687 --> 01:59:13.908]  It'll make a real and lasting difference.
[01:59:14.328 --> 01:59:19.910]  Treat the word impossible as nothing more than motivation.
[01:59:20.970 --> 01:59:23.311]  Three American hostages are back home.
[01:59:23.811 --> 01:59:28.273]  I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
[01:59:28.933 --> 01:59:35.975]  Seize this moment, believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe once more in America.
[01:59:36.976 --> 01:59:40.837]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body,
[01:59:42.219 --> 01:59:45.500]  And I will never, ever let you down.
[01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:48.441]  The forgotten man and the forgotten woman.
[01:59:49.601 --> 01:59:51.921]  You're not forgotten anymore.
[01:59:54.402 --> 01:59:58.503]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.023 --> 02:00:00.364]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.845 --> 02:00:09.586]  Regrets, I've had a few.
[02:00:11.650 --> 02:00:29.759]  You know, the mainstream media are so blind to how they attack me.
[02:00:29.799 --> 02:00:40.084]  I'm going to talk about this in the next segment, but they think that when I'm getting attacked, I'm getting monetary things taken away that I think I'm losing.
[02:00:41.587 --> 02:00:43.627]  I'm not just trying to make money or I would have joined them.
[02:00:44.548 --> 02:00:46.388]  I'm trying to take the country back.
[02:00:46.468 --> 02:00:50.168]  I'm trying to defeat them because they're a clear and present danger of nasty, horrible people.
[02:00:50.509 --> 02:01:03.971]  And after they've done all this stuff to us and everybody else, don't they get we're now just reckon ordering and reorganizing and that we're not going to go away, that now they really have... Because I sort of asked this question earlier and then I forgot to get to the answer.
[02:01:05.111 --> 02:01:06.671]  We kind of joke around about this too much.
[02:01:06.711 --> 02:01:08.032]  This is real authoritarianism.
[02:01:08.072 --> 02:01:09.852]  How do we bring immediacy to this?
[02:01:10.888 --> 02:01:22.692]  And let folks know, this is deadly serious, because even if, you know, Sheba, Dr. Sheba, running for Senate doesn't win, he's won by taking the arena.
[02:01:22.812 --> 02:01:24.572]  He will be hurting the globalists.
[02:01:24.792 --> 02:01:25.432]  And he could win!
[02:01:26.433 --> 02:01:27.693]  And so, that's what we're getting at.
[02:01:27.873 --> 02:01:30.754]  So, Sheba, continue here again.
[02:01:31.014 --> 02:01:33.915]  What's the best website for folks to visit to find out more about you running for Senate?
[02:01:34.707 --> 02:01:35.207]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:01:35.227 --> 02:01:38.970]  The best website is shiva4senate, the numeral 4senate.com.
[02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:43.674]  And by the way, Alex, you know we have these awesome magnetic signs, road warrior signs.
[02:01:43.694 --> 02:01:46.456]  We've probably got about a thousand of them out on the road right now.
[02:01:47.197 --> 02:01:59.307]  And in response to us getting this meme out, only the real Indian can defeat the fake Indian, the Boston Globe, which used to be previously owned by the New York Times, I think they paid some ridiculous amount of money and then sold it back,
[02:01:59.847 --> 02:02:02.590]  To some guy who runs the Boston Red Sox here.
[02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:12.859]  The interesting thing about that is they wrote nearly like a 15-page article, Alex, trying to say that Elizabeth Warren did not get into Harvard because she was Native American.
[02:02:12.919 --> 02:02:17.863]  And this was a direct response to our explosively growing campaign on the ground.
[02:02:18.183 --> 02:02:20.966]  What's interesting in that article, Alex, is that
[02:02:22.021 --> 02:02:28.667]  They don't tell this to the people that no university is ever going to say, oh yeah, we hired Alex because he's a Native American.
[02:02:28.707 --> 02:02:31.089]  We hired Owen because he's Irish.
[02:02:31.149 --> 02:02:38.074]  But Harvard got sued though this year and they had to admit the admissions that they said Asians may have the highest test scores.
[02:02:38.775 --> 02:02:46.940]  But because they test low in our score for having a soul for being funny, we're saying they're stupid.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:56.505]  What a, that is the most racist, whacked out, and that's the thing is how's the left gonna deal with the top richest groups per capita being Asians?
[02:02:56.665 --> 02:02:59.466]  Nine groups of Asians are on top and then some white people.
[02:03:00.107 --> 02:03:05.030]  How in the world are they gonna sit there and say now you put blacks in slave camps?
[02:03:05.150 --> 02:03:05.690]  I just don't get it.
[02:03:06.653 --> 02:03:15.396]  Yeah, well, remember, what the liberal elite do is they actually like to pit black against white, you know, black against yellow.
[02:03:15.457 --> 02:03:16.717]  They like to create a race war.
[02:03:17.177 --> 02:03:20.198]  So what Harvard, you know, affirmative action was a gain of the civil rights movement.
[02:03:20.258 --> 02:03:21.039]  It was a band-aid.
[02:03:21.059 --> 02:03:23.200]  It never really solved the real fundamental issues.
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:31.423]  And what Harvard did was, if an Asian American applies, they apply a 20% discount to their SAT scores, for example.
[02:03:32.043 --> 02:03:38.745]  So that's how they were discriminating against Asians, and then Asians get upset with black people, and black people get upset with Asians.
[02:03:38.766 --> 02:03:43.627]  Sure, and Hollywood puts out movies that Asians owning stores are exploitive, then have your own store.
[02:03:43.647 --> 02:03:56.592]  I'm not against black, Asian, anybody, but like this, I just love how I hardly ever see Asians running around bitching and complaining, but that's why I think they've hired that racist lady at Harvard, SJW, is they're really trying to find some racist Asians to get that stirred up.
[02:03:57.412 --> 02:03:57.612]  Right.
[02:03:57.672 --> 02:04:02.774]  And the thing is, you know, many of these liberal elite always want to do diversity reports.
[02:04:03.094 --> 02:04:06.936]  There's no diversity report done on the faculty composition of Harvard.
[02:04:06.976 --> 02:04:07.796]  Why don't we do that?
[02:04:08.317 --> 02:04:10.397]  And we'll probably find some very illuminating things.
[02:04:10.417 --> 02:04:11.558]  Well, yeah, they're all basically white.
[02:04:12.914 --> 02:04:15.657]  They're white, and let's even do a religious analysis.
[02:04:15.698 --> 02:04:17.740]  If you were to say that, that's not allowed.
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.005]  So, the bottom line is, you know, they do analysis of other... Well, right, you just said it.
[02:04:22.025 --> 02:04:23.566]  A certain religion dominates it.
[02:04:23.606 --> 02:04:24.507]  Which, exactly.
[02:04:24.868 --> 02:04:28.412]  And then it's leftists that are always pushing race because they're obsessed with it!
[02:04:29.147 --> 02:04:30.708]  Right, but they don't put it on themselves.
[02:04:30.728 --> 02:04:44.233]  So Elizabeth Warren, you know, wants a white guy on stage with her, a dumb white guy, you know, a dumb white guy who's a fake Republican, because the Democrats want, you know, real Republicans, real conservatives not really to be exposed.
[02:04:44.333 --> 02:04:45.173]  No, exactly.
[02:04:45.333 --> 02:04:48.735]  Look, if you get on the stage, you could probably win an upset, so we gotta get you in there.
[02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:49.776]  Absolutely.
[02:04:49.996 --> 02:04:53.120]  Let's come back and do a few minutes with you, though, on the history of the Post Office, because you know your stuff.
[02:04:53.441 --> 02:04:54.442]  I want to hear your plan for that.
[02:04:54.462 --> 02:04:56.685]  And then, Owen, I'm going to ask you a big question straight ahead.
[02:04:56.705 --> 02:04:57.466]  This is a big question.
[02:04:57.486 --> 02:05:00.150]  So, folks, stay with us and spread those links, or Soros wins.
[02:05:00.570 --> 02:05:01.011]  Seriously!
[02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:11.764]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[02:05:12.184 --> 02:05:13.065]  And I want to thank you all.
[02:05:13.145 --> 02:05:14.125]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[02:05:14.145 --> 02:05:15.927]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[02:05:15.967 --> 02:05:22.251]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[02:05:22.511 --> 02:05:24.632]  And we've got products that help you.
[02:05:24.652 --> 02:05:27.634]  I mean, even mainstream media admits they have to, that fish roe is the best thing out there.
[02:05:27.814 --> 02:05:29.015]  But you want pure fish oil.
[02:05:29.115 --> 02:05:30.516]  You want the mercury removed.
[02:05:30.636 --> 02:05:33.037]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[02:05:33.077 --> 02:05:33.818]  The best krill oil.
[02:05:33.878 --> 02:05:36.519]  The best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic.
[02:05:36.579 --> 02:05:40.041]  Salmon and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids.
[02:05:40.482 --> 02:05:40.962]  The Honor Roll.
[02:05:41.002 --> 02:05:41.622]  Three different types.
[02:05:41.682 --> 02:05:42.583]  You cannot do better.
[02:05:42.643 --> 02:05:43.223]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:43.483 --> 02:05:44.024]  Help the brain.
[02:05:44.064 --> 02:05:44.524]  Help the body.
[02:05:44.544 --> 02:05:44.984]  Help the heart.
[02:05:45.024 --> 02:05:45.585]  Help the InfoWars.
[02:05:45.605 --> 02:05:46.425]  Win, win, win, win, win, win.
[02:05:46.425 --> 02:05:47.185]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:05:47.225 --> 02:05:48.386]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:39.415 --> 02:06:44.798]  She was running for Congress, and he's really got Elizabeth Warren and Pocahontas mad.
[02:06:45.598 --> 02:06:46.639]  She doesn't want him in the debates.
[02:06:46.679 --> 02:07:02.266]  But just finishing up, you have a plan for the post office that I find intriguing, because I know, and I read about Benjamin Franklin and the whole setting up the post office and the plan, because the British were always manipulating mail and charging you more or less, and things were notoriously might take a year to even, you know, go 500 miles.
[02:07:02.286 --> 02:07:03.627]  People were really sick of it.
[02:07:04.167 --> 02:07:05.388]  And our post office
[02:07:05.928 --> 02:07:09.050]  was like the model of well-oiled corporate machines later.
[02:07:09.370 --> 02:07:14.173]  So how did our government then deliver a system, because it was privatized, that now has become such a problem?
[02:07:14.374 --> 02:07:20.237]  And I know big companies want to get rid of it, but couldn't we reform it to create checks and balances with the private corporates?
[02:07:20.578 --> 02:07:21.518]  That's a big debate.
[02:07:22.619 --> 02:07:23.900]  What's your plan, Doctor?
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:28.583]  So, Alex, I don't want to promote anything, but this is a pretty good book I wrote.
[02:07:28.603 --> 02:07:29.944]  It's called The Future of Email.
[02:07:30.424 --> 02:07:32.005]  And I say it's here and it's dangerous.
[02:07:32.425 --> 02:07:35.067]  And one of the chapters... And you're the inventor of email on record?
[02:07:35.689 --> 02:07:38.690]  I invented the first email system, so I know a little bit about email.
[02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:43.992]  One of the chapters I have, you can see it, it's called Hillary's Email and the New Cast System.
[02:07:44.572 --> 02:08:00.197]  And what I talk about in this book is that when the post office was set up, it was set up as just like the checks and balances of the United States government, the post office was a very important institution.
[02:08:00.477 --> 02:08:05.299]  And the goal was that I could send an email to Alex, Alex could send an email to Owen, and no one would
[02:08:06.681 --> 02:08:09.523]  If they did, 20-year prison sentence, right?
[02:08:10.064 --> 02:08:13.346]  And it was also designed low-cost, and it was pretty amazing.
[02:08:13.386 --> 02:08:20.532]  And the postal service still today is quite amazing that you could send for, you know, a small amount of money, letters all over.
[02:08:20.572 --> 02:08:22.293]  And in fact, Amazon exploits the U.S.
[02:08:22.333 --> 02:08:23.474]  Postal Service, which trumped it.
[02:08:23.514 --> 02:08:28.178]  And if it wasn't there, that infrastructure wasn't there, the corporates would triple charges.
[02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:29.354]  Exactly.
[02:08:29.414 --> 02:08:31.596]  So the Postal Service is a mega institution.
[02:08:32.016 --> 02:08:40.982]  Now, in 1997, you know, one of the companies I did, separate from the invention of email, was to actually analyze email that grew to a very large company.
[02:08:41.242 --> 02:08:50.568]  And in 1997, the reason I bring up that date was that was the date that email volume exceeded snail mail or paper mail volume.
[02:08:51.028 --> 02:08:52.729]  And I saw this very interesting trend.
[02:08:53.130 --> 02:09:03.838]  Four years before that, you had companies like Hotmail, Yahoo, Google came into the mix, and they were offering public, free email services.
[02:09:03.878 --> 02:09:04.418]  Everyone remember this?
[02:09:04.438 --> 02:09:04.418]  1993.
[02:09:04.458 --> 02:09:05.759]  1993 was when those companies started coming.
[02:09:09.238 --> 02:09:11.700]  Now in 1997, email volume exceeded.
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:19.145]  So I actually met with the Postal Service while I was running my company, Echo Mail, and I said, look, there's a serious problem here.
[02:09:19.445 --> 02:09:19.885]  The U.S.
[02:09:19.945 --> 02:09:27.790]  Postal Service should offer a public email service as an alternative to these private free email services.
[02:09:28.210 --> 02:09:30.292]  And you guys could probably charge about 50 bucks.
[02:09:31.706 --> 02:09:34.167]  But you would protect the email.
[02:09:35.088 --> 02:09:37.810]  Because that would put under federal law's umbrella that no one can read it.
[02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:38.810]  Exactly.
[02:09:39.151 --> 02:09:45.275]  Because what most Americans don't know is when they sign up for their free... Is it Google and all of them read it all, sell it all?
[02:09:45.734 --> 02:09:49.479]  Read it all, and they're signing away, frankly, their freedom because it says they own it.
[02:10:02.392 --> 02:10:05.054]  Right, so that's what Google and Facebook are fundamentally doing.
[02:10:05.374 --> 02:10:06.735]  So the Postal Service was set up.
[02:10:06.775 --> 02:10:13.080]  So, the Postal Service, these guys are making a lot of money, these fat cats, not innovators like Franklin.
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:13.760]  They laughed at me.
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:15.381]  They said, look, we're the Postal Service.
[02:10:15.641 --> 02:10:16.762]  We don't need to do that.
[02:10:17.022 --> 02:10:18.463]  We're in the print mail business.
[02:10:18.483 --> 02:10:19.504]  What are you talking about email?
[02:10:19.724 --> 02:10:21.165]  Well, fast forward to 2011.
[02:10:21.205 --> 02:10:25.248]  Sure, they didn't get, then they could have advertisements, then they could have other services.
[02:10:25.288 --> 02:10:27.550]  They could have been the Amazon.
[02:10:28.343 --> 02:10:28.803]  Exactly.
[02:10:28.863 --> 02:10:34.185]  So fast forward to 2011, the morons at the Postal Service announced that they're going out of business.
[02:10:34.245 --> 02:10:34.765]  Bankrupt.
[02:10:35.205 --> 02:10:35.525]  Okay?
[02:10:36.145 --> 02:10:41.767]  And I hit them hard again, and there was an article that came out in Time Magazine, and I said, look, you guys didn't listen to me.
[02:10:43.088 --> 02:10:44.668]  You should have done what I told you to.
[02:10:45.088 --> 02:10:47.089]  The IG of the Postal Service
[02:10:47.509 --> 02:10:47.849]  We're good.
[02:11:06.097 --> 02:11:11.759]  By, A, offering a public digital service, not only for email, Alex, but for social media services.
[02:11:12.259 --> 02:11:14.080]  And it would protect us as Americans.
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.481]  Well, again, I delivered those reports, they threw them in the trash, probably.
[02:11:17.861 --> 02:11:20.882]  Because these guys, you know, lawyer lobbyists affect them.
[02:11:21.122 --> 02:11:26.704]  They probably, you know, I haven't done the research, but they probably are in collusion with Google, Facebook, etc.
[02:11:27.044 --> 02:11:30.745]  But the opportunities of postal service, think about it, has all the infrastructure.
[02:11:31.085 --> 02:11:33.946]  They have little physical real estate in every little town.
[02:11:34.386 --> 02:11:39.628]  Well, on that physical real estate... And they have the federal law and the culture where they're not allowed to read it.
[02:11:39.889 --> 02:11:41.389]  But it gets even more interesting, Alex.
[02:11:41.869 --> 02:11:53.355]  On each of those postal service towers, we could put up what are called a mesh network antennas, and we could create our own... And there you have a true federal communications network.
[02:11:53.815 --> 02:11:55.556]  And people are like, this is government, we don't want that.
[02:11:55.836 --> 02:11:57.857]  The tech companies are already bigger than government!
[02:11:58.177 --> 02:12:06.043]  And this is something that I think President Trump will understand, and Brad Parscale, perhaps, 2020 campaign manager, is something, you know, with Sheva breaking it down.
[02:12:06.063 --> 02:12:10.967]  Because it could be a free network that isn't censored, and it would destroy Facebook and Google and everyone!
[02:12:11.027 --> 02:12:11.587]  Yeah!
[02:12:11.887 --> 02:12:12.908]  That's a hell of an idea!
[02:12:14.349 --> 02:12:18.731]  Inventor of email comes up with plan to stop big tech censorship.
[02:12:18.952 --> 02:12:19.732]  The post office.
[02:12:19.972 --> 02:12:21.333]  That's the headline for this segment.
[02:12:21.433 --> 02:12:25.035]  And that's why they want Shiva off the stage for this debate and not in Congress.
[02:12:25.155 --> 02:12:25.775]  This right here.
[02:12:25.835 --> 02:12:30.278]  Because if these big companies won't do it, they should be regulated A, because they're violating the First Amendment.
[02:12:30.858 --> 02:12:32.919]  Let them get their money all day, just don't have monopolies.
[02:12:33.099 --> 02:12:34.500]  But you're right, it's the post office.
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:36.361]  We already have the damn infrastructure.
[02:12:36.861 --> 02:12:37.061]  Right.
[02:12:37.481 --> 02:12:41.642]  We would create a physical network, which would be independent of AT&T, Vodafone, etc.
[02:12:41.682 --> 02:12:49.764]  Because remember what Mubarak did in Egypt, when the students were protesting, right when the workers came on the street, he made one phone call to Vodafone.
[02:12:50.084 --> 02:12:50.944]  We can't have that.
[02:12:51.224 --> 02:12:57.826]  So, I'm of a deep, deep... Because we have Google and the big tech companies attacking Trump and the US government.
[02:12:58.366 --> 02:13:03.149]  With foreign assets trying to stop our elections, we need our own U.S.
[02:13:03.189 --> 02:13:03.950]  communications.
[02:13:04.350 --> 02:13:05.331]  We do need U.S.
[02:13:05.371 --> 02:13:06.732]  communications.
[02:13:06.932 --> 02:13:09.874]  We talk about the Second Amendment, but the pen is mightier than the sword.
[02:13:10.174 --> 02:13:14.537]  And the First Amendment has been gutted because we've gutted the U.S.
[02:13:14.577 --> 02:13:15.318]  Postal Service.
[02:13:15.618 --> 02:13:20.341]  And one of the things I would do is to lay out that architecture, resurrect the Postal Service.
[02:13:20.401 --> 02:13:23.343]  And anything goes on it, but stuff that's illegal.
[02:13:23.443 --> 02:13:25.105]  It has to be absolutely open and free.
[02:13:25.845 --> 02:13:27.225]  That's already protected by the laws.
[02:13:27.265 --> 02:13:28.446]  We don't have to do that anymore.
[02:13:28.466 --> 02:13:34.788]  You know, you can't send illegal stuff, but the most important thing is if anyone interferes, it's 20-year federal sentence.
[02:13:35.108 --> 02:13:38.289]  We need a federal digital system, and we already have it.
[02:13:38.489 --> 02:13:40.250]  You already paid for it, and it's there.
[02:13:41.050 --> 02:13:42.010]  You really are a genius.
[02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:44.751]  We gotta have you up to do a full hour on this because...
[02:13:45.131 --> 02:13:46.392]  Alex, let me just finish this one thing.
[02:13:46.693 --> 02:13:50.016]  When Hillary Clinton put her private mail server, we're talking about a cast system.
[02:13:50.296 --> 02:13:58.485]  So what's going to happen is the wealthy people will create their own digital networks, and we get the free crap from, you know, Facebook, Google, everyone else.
[02:13:58.505 --> 02:14:00.087]  You see, they're creating a two-tier communication.
[02:14:00.107 --> 02:14:01.508]  That's what they all do.
[02:14:01.568 --> 02:14:03.090]  And then they cut us out of the marketplace.
[02:14:03.931 --> 02:14:04.311]  Exactly.
[02:14:04.351 --> 02:14:10.934]  So Alex, I think the fundamental issue here is we're probably going to have a revolution in this country the way things are going with this kind of banning.
[02:14:11.295 --> 02:14:20.679]  But the patriots like you, myself, others, the quote-unquote alternative media, we need to start organizing as one united front.
[02:14:20.999 --> 02:14:23.620]  That is also another... That's the answer.
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:25.020]  Not just President Trump taking action.
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:38.063]  We have to organize into a united front for the First Amendment and deploy ideas both that are positive and also that are administrative to people that are already corporately usurping us.
[02:14:38.103 --> 02:14:39.303]  We're not calling for regulations.
[02:14:39.523 --> 02:14:42.564]  We're calling for laws to block corporate usurpation.
[02:14:43.591 --> 02:14:44.631]  In fact, that's what happened.
[02:14:45.152 --> 02:14:50.413]  In the Reagan era, DHL and FedEx, the lobbyists gutted the Postal Service.
[02:14:50.433 --> 02:14:55.395]  They took away all the very valuable services and they left the Postal Service with the spoils.
[02:14:55.855 --> 02:14:57.175]  That's what happened in the 80s.
[02:14:57.435 --> 02:14:58.816]  And that's why we're suffering today.
[02:14:59.236 --> 02:15:04.098]  Alex, you know, look, the debates are planned against the fake Trumper and the fake Indian.
[02:15:04.378 --> 02:15:06.319]  And we want to plan massive protests.
[02:15:06.339 --> 02:15:08.699]  So if you guys want to come here, we should do this.
[02:15:08.719 --> 02:15:12.681]  There's a historic opportunity to expose a fake Indian and the fake Trumpers.
[02:15:13.001 --> 02:15:13.961]  No, no, I agree.
[02:15:14.141 --> 02:15:15.742]  I'm going into the third dimension now.
[02:15:15.782 --> 02:15:16.922]  They're kicking me out of the internet.
[02:15:17.983 --> 02:15:18.303]  What's that?
[02:15:18.643 --> 02:15:19.123]  We're going to come.
[02:15:20.054 --> 02:15:21.095]  Yeah, you guys got to come.
[02:15:21.135 --> 02:15:23.716]  We got to raise hell because this is where the revolution took place.
[02:15:23.937 --> 02:15:33.003]  And I'm telling you this singular issue of trying to keep a real Indian off the stage by Elizabeth Warren, who claims is a huge historic opportunity to expose these people.
[02:15:33.243 --> 02:15:36.105]  And I say we need to create a massive, massive movement.
[02:15:36.345 --> 02:15:37.946]  And what better place in Massachusetts?
[02:15:38.026 --> 02:15:38.867]  Alex, you're invited.
[02:15:39.147 --> 02:15:39.987]  Owen, you're invited.
[02:15:40.248 --> 02:15:43.770]  We got to get all the media people here and we got to take this down.
[02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:46.572]  And if they don't let me on that stage, we need to raise hell.
[02:15:46.952 --> 02:15:49.794]  And that hell needs to be why they attacked Alex Jones.
[02:15:50.234 --> 02:15:52.975]  I'm here in the InfoWars bunker and I'm coming to you from one of our new studios.
[02:16:08.757 --> 02:16:13.880]  We've gained hundreds of new affiliates last month, but my God, Soros and the Communist Chinese are coming down on us hard.
[02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:19.422]  And you know, I see Google and Facebook and Apple especially moving to China and helping suppress their people.
[02:16:20.683 --> 02:16:21.283]  It freaks me out.
[02:16:22.124 --> 02:16:25.265]  Because China has killed five times the number of people that Adolf Hitler did.
[02:16:26.226 --> 02:16:30.968]  But oh, because they're Chinese, it's okay, because media taught us only white people can do bad stuff.
[02:16:32.210 --> 02:16:37.958]  It freaks me out to see all these big tech companies saying, let's just ban Trump supporters, period.
[02:16:38.258 --> 02:16:39.940]  Let's ban all Alex Jones supporters.
[02:16:40.801 --> 02:16:42.103]  They're putting us in a digital gulag.
[02:16:42.143 --> 02:16:45.568]  But the good news is, humanity is fighting back.
[02:16:45.828 --> 02:16:47.610]  And that's why I'm coming to you from this new studio.
[02:16:48.843 --> 02:16:54.365]  That we're building is one of the most state-of-the-art in the country to transmit the truth worldwide to the people.
[02:16:55.085 --> 02:16:56.246]  We've got big plans.
[02:16:56.846 --> 02:17:01.968]  That's why I'm asking all of you, however you can support or whatever you can do, we are all in this together.
[02:17:02.328 --> 02:17:03.409]  Look at this studio.
[02:17:03.789 --> 02:17:04.689]  Look at what we're doing.
[02:17:04.989 --> 02:17:06.070]  Look at the crew we're hiring.
[02:17:06.370 --> 02:17:07.650]  Look at all the things that are happening.
[02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:08.591]  It's epic.
[02:17:09.911 --> 02:17:12.132]  And then, take these products right here.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:16.441]  We have the best fish oil for adults and children.
[02:17:16.761 --> 02:17:20.302]  We have the best CoQ10 and PQQ.
[02:17:20.362 --> 02:17:23.063]  We have the best bone broth, it's all there.
[02:17:24.023 --> 02:17:29.025]  You get these products, you get things that help you and your body and your family, and they help fund the information war.
[02:17:29.325 --> 02:17:30.665]  And these sales are going to end this week.
[02:17:31.646 --> 02:17:33.366]  So I commend you, I salute you, I thank you.
[02:17:33.386 --> 02:17:36.527]  But take advantage of these sales right now, some of the biggest ever.
[02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:39.028]  50% off on many of these products.
[02:17:39.408 --> 02:17:41.229]  Free shipping on many of the items, you name it.
[02:17:42.168 --> 02:17:43.209]  And we'll be able to move forward.
[02:17:44.129 --> 02:17:47.071]  Quite frankly, it's crazy how this stuff works.
[02:17:47.131 --> 02:17:51.614]  Because every attack they launch, you bring in just enough support to counter it.
[02:17:51.634 --> 02:17:53.435]  Then they attack again, just enough support.
[02:17:53.935 --> 02:17:58.758]  You know, the Patriot in me wants to see us way up here to feel confident, but that's not how God works.
[02:17:59.539 --> 02:18:04.221]  It's you that keep hanging with us and making the decision to support us, that as they double down, you double down.
[02:18:04.502 --> 02:18:06.503]  As they attack, you move back against them.
[02:18:07.782 --> 02:18:08.723]  It's an amazing time.
[02:18:08.943 --> 02:18:09.724]  The products are great.
[02:18:09.944 --> 02:18:10.784]  The t-shirts are great.
[02:18:10.825 --> 02:18:11.485]  The books are great.
[02:18:11.585 --> 02:18:12.426]  All the material is great.
[02:18:12.746 --> 02:18:13.627]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:13.927 --> 02:18:18.531]  Without you, we're not going to be able to launch this and counter these jerks.
[02:18:19.211 --> 02:18:23.175]  Without you, they're going to use us as the template, the blueprint, to shut all of you down.
[02:18:24.055 --> 02:18:26.077]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done.
[02:18:26.097 --> 02:18:27.298]  I want to commend you for what you've done.
[02:18:27.338 --> 02:18:29.360]  I want to encourage you now more than ever.
[02:18:30.103 --> 02:18:35.904]  To think about what you're doing in history, and the fact you've already committed so much to freedom, you've already seen so many good things happen.
[02:18:36.524 --> 02:18:45.767]  Now's the time to double down against these jerks, the New York Times, and CNN, and the jerks over at the Washington Post, and the Chi-Com murderers, and the scum in Hollywood.
[02:18:46.067 --> 02:18:48.047]  We're standing against them, and we're delivering.
[02:18:48.567 --> 02:18:52.368]  And the economy's coming back, and people are coming together, but they're counter-striking.
[02:18:52.748 --> 02:18:56.029]  And without you standing with us, we will be shut down.
[02:18:56.849 --> 02:18:58.009]  They want to demoralize you.
[02:18:58.690 --> 02:18:59.890]  They want to tell you you're weak.
[02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:05.332]  They want to say we're losing in the face of this attack because they want you to think your support didn't do jack squat!
[02:19:06.352 --> 02:19:09.534]  Your support has taken us to the most traffic InfoWars has ever gotten.
[02:19:10.014 --> 02:19:11.594]  And it's brought in the most money we've ever gotten.
[02:19:12.695 --> 02:19:13.395]  But I'll be honest with you.
[02:19:14.423 --> 02:19:16.946]  Until they banned us, we were losing money for six, seven months.
[02:19:17.687 --> 02:19:20.810]  Because people thought everything was fine, and you know, Trump was there, and everything was okay.
[02:19:21.671 --> 02:19:23.913]  And so we're still behind for the year, what we need to expand.
[02:19:24.374 --> 02:19:25.254]  We might even contract.
[02:19:25.695 --> 02:19:31.141]  But with current numbers, it looks like we're gonna be able to launch the expansion, and the satellites, and everything, thanks to you!
[02:19:31.761 --> 02:19:32.922]  But it's up to you right now!
[02:19:33.783 --> 02:19:36.767]  My fighting spirit's never been stronger, because I can feel the enemies about to bring it.
[02:19:37.816 --> 02:19:38.457]  To their next level.
[02:19:38.477 --> 02:19:40.158]  But we're going to bring it to our next level as well.
[02:19:40.659 --> 02:19:43.101]  So I'm counting on you right now and I love you and I appreciate you.
[02:19:43.481 --> 02:19:48.466]  So whatever you do, however you do it, legally and lawfully, get the word out and support InfoWars.
[02:19:48.766 --> 02:19:50.428]  It's symbiotic, it supports you as well.
[02:19:51.008 --> 02:19:51.769]  I thank you again.
[02:19:51.789 --> 02:19:55.633]  This is quite an epic time of your life.
[02:19:55.653 --> 02:19:57.374]  60 days out from the election right now.
[02:19:59.216 --> 02:20:00.177]  History's happening right now.
[02:20:00.978 --> 02:20:01.859]  What are you going to do right now?
[02:20:05.712 --> 02:20:11.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:24.455]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:36.553 --> 02:20:38.535]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:20:38.595 --> 02:20:39.916]  Owen Schroer riding shotgun.
[02:20:39.956 --> 02:20:46.260]  Coming up in about an hour and a half he'll be live with the War Room with Roger Stone for as long as he's here before he gets indicted.
[02:20:47.321 --> 02:20:56.268]  And of course they've got the Obama-Hillary version of the FBI breathing down my neck doing just insane bonker stuff I can't tell you about.
[02:20:56.308 --> 02:20:58.330]  But they're not just trying to take me off the air folks.
[02:20:58.390 --> 02:20:59.811]  I can tell you that this is reached.
[02:21:01.474 --> 02:21:03.215]  War-level proportions in this country.
[02:21:03.316 --> 02:21:04.837]  These people are insane.
[02:21:05.157 --> 02:21:11.402]  Now, Dr. Steve Pachinik was head of psychological operations in the State Department and worked with the CIA and helped found Delta Force.
[02:21:11.442 --> 02:21:19.689]  He's a best-selling author and, of course, helped write the whole Jack Ryan series, which is back now on television as well, and worked closely with Tom Clancy as one of his main sources.
[02:21:21.078 --> 02:21:24.480]  At Steve Pachinick, for now, still on Twitter, and StevePachinick.com.
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:26.962]  We're with Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:21:27.142 --> 02:21:44.213]  You told me, back in February, when they lied in the news and said, Jones says no one died at Parkland, and they took me off YouTube, you said, YouTube, which in Google, was founded by In-Q-Tel and the Geospatial Center, and I knew that was true, so was Facebook, and it will be stopped.
[02:21:44.254 --> 02:21:44.994]  You will be back up.
[02:21:45.194 --> 02:21:50.658]  Three days later, they said, rogue groups did it, the Southern Property Law Center, Bloomberg reported, Alex Jones is back up.
[02:21:51.398 --> 02:22:00.342]  So I know there's governmental connections, and I know there's a CIA stay-behind group that Obama signed an executive order on in December of 2016, and I know that's what's going on.
[02:22:00.362 --> 02:22:01.883]  I know who the officers of it are.
[02:22:03.123 --> 02:22:04.664]  We've got this guy at CNN.
[02:22:06.225 --> 02:22:07.425]  That's one of the heads of it.
[02:22:08.345 --> 02:22:13.908]  These are some real snot noses, and I confronted one of them, and they said, oh, I'm banned for talking to him.
[02:22:13.968 --> 02:22:14.868]  It's like he's royalty.
[02:22:15.268 --> 02:22:18.650]  He tells, this Brandon Darcy guy tells
[02:22:20.902 --> 02:22:21.802]  Twitter, what to do?
[02:22:21.902 --> 02:22:22.283]  Literally.
[02:22:22.683 --> 02:22:25.364]  Because they think it's from, like, Obama, like he's still the president.
[02:22:25.584 --> 02:22:28.866]  They still call him Mr. President, and he's sitting there doing it.
[02:22:28.906 --> 02:22:37.849]  So, you showed you know what's going on, Dr. Steve Buchanan, so I've kind of set the table, and we're not trying to act like we're in a spy thriller.
[02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:39.610]  It's beyond that at this point.
[02:22:39.650 --> 02:22:40.391]  This is really happening.
[02:22:41.505 --> 02:22:46.849]  I know you say you've got intel on who the real fake op-ed piece is of the Resistance of the New York Times.
[02:22:47.209 --> 02:22:48.049]  You say you've got more intel.
[02:22:48.069 --> 02:22:49.230]  But just a selfish question.
[02:22:49.711 --> 02:22:50.871]  They're not just purging me.
[02:22:50.991 --> 02:22:52.192]  It's thousands a day.
[02:22:52.592 --> 02:22:54.033]  I mean, millions total.
[02:22:54.354 --> 02:22:57.296]  This, 60 days out, I think they're scared.
[02:22:57.356 --> 02:22:59.517]  But this is so un-American, what's happening.
[02:22:59.917 --> 02:23:01.498]  Then they lie about who they banned.
[02:23:02.419 --> 02:23:04.821]  So, Doc, what's your intel on this purge?
[02:23:04.841 --> 02:23:06.682]  Because you were right last time that it would be stopped.
[02:23:07.002 --> 02:23:08.683]  You're saying, hey, this fight isn't over yet.
[02:23:09.384 --> 02:23:09.884]  Which is strange.
[02:23:09.944 --> 02:23:10.805]  On Twitter and YouTube,
[02:23:11.365 --> 02:23:12.266]  We can get in the back end.
[02:23:12.306 --> 02:23:13.287]  It's all still there.
[02:23:13.848 --> 02:23:15.350]  Usually when you get banned, it's gone.
[02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:16.411]  It's still there.
[02:23:16.752 --> 02:23:18.194]  So, Doc, what's going on here?
[02:23:20.056 --> 02:23:21.338]  I think several things.
[02:23:21.458 --> 02:23:24.442]  Number one, Jack Dorsey's in severe trouble.
[02:23:24.762 --> 02:23:26.945]  Number one, I'm an owner of Twitter.
[02:23:27.225 --> 02:23:29.368]  I own thousands of shares of Twitter.
[02:23:30.243 --> 02:23:30.744]  And he has
[02:23:46.698 --> 02:23:47.938]  Facebook is a disaster.
[02:23:48.499 --> 02:24:04.925]  It's in financial down spiral because they found out that the model and the paradigm for Facebook viewer is a older woman married who has been divorced and that just isn't going to work.
[02:24:05.405 --> 02:24:13.529]  So you have two companies that are flowing down and basically are heading towards severe financial ruin.
[02:24:13.749 --> 02:24:16.250]  Jack Dorsey is a terrible CEO.
[02:24:17.010 --> 02:24:24.337]  He is heading up square, which fortunately is doing better, but he has no idea of how to handle Twitter and how to monetize it.
[02:24:24.697 --> 02:24:35.367]  The irony is, as a stockholder, I went and tried to reach Jack Dorsey before any of your problems came up, and honestly, there was nowhere to get there.
[02:24:35.567 --> 02:24:35.807]  No.
[02:24:36.008 --> 02:24:37.609]  Number one, he may not even exist.
[02:24:37.689 --> 02:24:39.070]  It's a virtual reality.
[02:24:39.491 --> 02:24:43.354]  You call up Twitter in San Francisco, you get a voicemail.
[02:24:43.674 --> 02:24:49.359]  The voicemail tells you to write on the Internet and the Internet tells you that this is a virtual reality.
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:51.881]  And the what do we call it?
[02:24:51.921 --> 02:24:54.804]  The quarterly reviews are not done in person.
[02:24:54.844 --> 02:24:56.205]  They're virtual reality.
[02:24:56.725 --> 02:25:05.189]  So Dempsey has a real problem right now as the CEO who may be thrown out of a company that he really doesn't know how to work in.
[02:25:05.209 --> 02:25:05.889]  Let me ask you this.
[02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:12.412]  We know they set up the CIA office, this is admitted, and Senator Warner is running it.
[02:25:13.012 --> 02:25:21.825]  And then you've got these media people from the Washington Times, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and other areas that literally tell Twitter and Google what to do.
[02:25:21.865 --> 02:25:24.910]  I mean, they brag, they call, and they ban whoever they say.
[02:25:25.271 --> 02:25:26.252]  What is that nexus?
[02:25:26.272 --> 02:25:27.294]  Who's in command of that?
[02:25:29.170 --> 02:25:40.218]  I don't know who is the particular individual who's in command, but you have to remember, this type of internet analysis or this type of internet existence is binary.
[02:25:40.238 --> 02:25:41.279]  It's one and zero.
[02:25:41.839 --> 02:25:46.502]  Roger Stone said something very accurate months ago and I do agree with him.
[02:25:46.742 --> 02:25:48.864]  You guys are literally
[02:25:49.562 --> 02:25:59.990]  The test case of what happens in the internet world when you have dissension, compromise, and you begin to push the system too hard.
[02:26:00.511 --> 02:26:03.153]  And what's happening is the system can't handle it.
[02:26:03.855 --> 02:26:12.079]  They talking about algorithms and I told one of my guys and NGA this has nothing to do with algorithms because I was demonetized.
[02:26:12.599 --> 02:26:22.703]  I'm demonetized repeatedly for my blogs and my videos and I explained that you have that in of we call in Google they have over 10,000 people
[02:26:24.304 --> 02:26:27.047]  Who evaluate what is correct and not correct.
[02:26:27.087 --> 02:26:45.184]  Now to show you how incompetent Google is and Facebook is and any other of the internet companies, you have to go back 10 years ago where I had a medical company, nutritional company in Montana called NBI, which I founded, created and developed.
[02:26:45.785 --> 02:26:56.881]  And then with my partner we had to pay $6,000 a month for SEO, search engine optimization, because then Google was telling us that we're too commercial.
[02:26:57.522 --> 02:27:00.606]  So what's happening is the rise of a fascist
[02:27:01.287 --> 02:27:01.628]  I think?
[02:27:20.888 --> 02:27:26.390]  Google now refuses to work with the Pentagon on machine learning, but is helping China in weapon systems?
[02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:27.370]  Machine learning?
[02:27:27.390 --> 02:27:29.131]  They should be SWAT teamed immediately!
[02:27:29.151 --> 02:27:31.511]  I mean, that is treason, and it's true!
[02:27:31.872 --> 02:27:42.675]  And then they're moving to China helping censor, and they're doing all this, helping shut me down, saying I'm a bad person, when they're working with China and other authoritarian regimes, and only Cotton got it!
[02:27:42.735 --> 02:27:43.355]  You just said it!
[02:27:43.775 --> 02:27:45.356]  Google is monstrous!
[02:27:46.328 --> 02:27:47.049]  That's correct.
[02:27:47.350 --> 02:27:56.123]  The irony of Google is that Brian, the Soviet Jew who started this along with Page, came out of Stanford.
[02:27:56.603 --> 02:28:00.149]  I told him that, look, had I known what you would have ended up to be,
[02:28:00.979 --> 02:28:08.942]  You became exactly like the Soviet Union that I had to take down in order for you to come here to the United States and create Google.
[02:28:09.463 --> 02:28:17.766]  So what you have with the leaders now is a fascist state and they're acting very much along the same lines from where they came up.
[02:28:17.866 --> 02:28:19.987]  We call that identification with the aggressive.
[02:28:20.427 --> 02:28:32.952]  But the reality is now that NGA, National Geospatial Agency and other military units and intelligence units are going to have to correct what's happening and they're aware of it.
[02:28:33.252 --> 02:28:37.134]  They want to know exactly to what extent this will carry on.
[02:28:37.374 --> 02:28:43.076]  But basically the American public has to be able to retaliate by number one,
[02:28:44.089 --> 02:28:47.250]  Banning the products, not using numbers... I'm gonna say, stay there.
[02:28:47.290 --> 02:28:51.132]  Let's talk about how we launch counter-assaults informationally, not violently.
[02:28:51.172 --> 02:28:53.073]  They keep saying we're violent against these people.
[02:28:53.133 --> 02:28:57.314]  I mean, Google is literally in bed with China at this point.
[02:28:57.414 --> 02:28:59.455]  I mean, Google has its legs back behind its ears.
[02:29:07.526 --> 02:29:12.690]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:15.132]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.

[02:30:12.930 --> 02:30:19.197]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:30:20.959 --> 02:30:27.302]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[02:32:51.319 --> 02:32:52.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.186 --> 02:33:24.448]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.209 --> 02:33:27.849]  Alright, Owen Troyer riding shotgun with me.
[02:33:27.889 --> 02:33:28.569]  Owen, jump in any time.
[02:33:28.669 --> 02:33:33.211]  Dr. Steve Pachenik of stevepachenik.com, best-selling author, one of the founders of Delta Force.
[02:33:33.631 --> 02:33:35.331]  You know, really smart patriot guy.
[02:33:35.391 --> 02:33:36.032]  Super accurate.
[02:33:36.052 --> 02:33:38.532]  He's been on the show for like 17 years.
[02:33:38.572 --> 02:33:40.313]  He came on about six, eight months after 9-11.
[02:33:40.573 --> 02:33:44.694]  And he's just, the more he's been on over the years, the more right he's been.
[02:33:45.614 --> 02:33:46.735]  But one thing he was wrong about,
[02:33:47.702 --> 02:33:49.023]  He was right about it too.
[02:33:49.043 --> 02:33:50.424]  It was back after Valentine's Day.
[02:33:50.504 --> 02:33:53.987]  I got banned on YouTube over totally fake stuff I didn't say.
[02:33:54.983 --> 02:33:58.686]  Which I had a right to say if I wanted to say nobody died at Parkland, I could have, but I didn't.
[02:33:58.806 --> 02:34:05.511]  I said they picked four kids out of 3,000 that are in the school actor club, they said they were on NBC, to be anti-gun PR people.
[02:34:05.551 --> 02:34:06.252]  That's totally true.
[02:34:06.752 --> 02:34:07.713]  And the police stood down.
[02:34:07.733 --> 02:34:11.456]  We were the first to report that because we had local kids on it who said it.
[02:34:11.616 --> 02:34:12.397]  Later it was confirmed.
[02:34:12.997 --> 02:34:21.343]  So they banned two of your videos and one of mine, knocked us off, and Pchenik said, no, I've talked to people, Geospatial is involved, all these groups, they're putting pressure on it.
[02:34:21.364 --> 02:34:22.945]  And I know Trump's put pressure on them.
[02:34:23.425 --> 02:34:26.406]  And I told people Trump would come out and start moving against him, which he is.
[02:34:26.427 --> 02:34:28.307]  The word is executive orders this week or next week.
[02:34:29.528 --> 02:34:30.468]  This next week's already here.
[02:34:31.329 --> 02:34:32.750]  But the president can't do everything.
[02:34:32.770 --> 02:34:33.750]  He's totally surrounded.
[02:34:34.370 --> 02:34:36.771]  And so Pchenik said, watch.
[02:34:36.892 --> 02:34:38.372]  And three days later, it was back up.
[02:34:38.872 --> 02:34:41.374]  And then Bloomberg came out and said, rogue groups did it.
[02:34:42.554 --> 02:34:43.495]  Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:34:44.312 --> 02:34:45.853]  But they just keep moving forward.
[02:34:45.893 --> 02:34:46.994]  And again, it's not about me.
[02:34:47.074 --> 02:34:50.436]  They're banning everybody else right now, like they don't care.
[02:34:50.496 --> 02:34:51.457]  It's so criminal.
[02:34:51.837 --> 02:34:53.118]  Who's ordering them to do it?
[02:34:53.178 --> 02:34:55.059]  Well, Senator Warner.
[02:34:55.079 --> 02:35:01.623]  They said in the hearing, thank you for your memos, which say we'll federalize you if you don't ban all the conservatives.
[02:35:01.883 --> 02:35:02.884]  Then they make statements.
[02:35:02.984 --> 02:35:05.626]  Wyden, Warner.
[02:35:07.069 --> 02:35:11.972]  And the guy out of Maine, Murphy, says Jones is only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:35:12.252 --> 02:35:13.753]  Banned thousands of sites.
[02:35:14.113 --> 02:35:17.415]  These people are naked authoritarians.
[02:35:17.455 --> 02:35:19.417]  This is like stuff out of history books.
[02:35:20.342 --> 02:35:29.524]  And they're this weird leftist cabal with a John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2017 funding this crap.
[02:35:30.045 --> 02:35:31.905]  The president needs to go bust that up.
[02:35:32.185 --> 02:35:38.947]  They call it, you know, countering foreign propaganda and disinformation act, but it's countering us that are trying to make the country great again.
[02:35:40.788 --> 02:35:41.889]  How do you quantify this?
[02:35:41.949 --> 02:35:43.810]  How do we stop these groups 60 days out?
[02:35:44.231 --> 02:35:45.211]  What do you think they're planning?
[02:35:45.231 --> 02:36:05.146]  And you said you got the big bombshell from your sources on who the supposed main author of this fable is, this whole canard that we've seen in the New York Times, the same anonymous sources, you know, were telling us about WMDs in Iraq and the Tooth Fairy delivering money to children that lose their mandibles.
[02:36:06.977 --> 02:36:09.419]  Let me start why I came on the show, though.
[02:36:09.439 --> 02:36:12.081]  I will assure you will remain on the show.
[02:36:12.841 --> 02:36:18.766]  There are too many elements of the intelligence community that are involved in the different organizations.
[02:36:18.966 --> 02:36:24.470]  Furthermore, all of your people, actually, your show went up in numbers, as I understand.
[02:36:25.131 --> 02:36:37.650]  More and more people are watching you and understanding what you're doing and you're really acting as the 1776 patriot against the system that we're just beginning to understand how repressive it has become.
[02:36:38.394 --> 02:36:53.921]  It will eventually have to be regulated and it will be regulated once Trump understands the severity of what's going on and the fact how many of our intelligence units are involved in the creation of these things.
[02:36:53.981 --> 02:37:01.325]  Of course, as you know, I was trained in DARPA 1972 by the CIA and by DARPA on the internet and social media.
[02:37:01.705 --> 02:37:07.448]  So Zuckerberg and Gates and all the other Bezos, all that other nonsense,
[02:37:07.908 --> 02:37:10.230]  Was nothing more than derivative of DARPA.
[02:37:10.770 --> 02:37:23.598]  So eventually this goes back to the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and those in the Pentagon who will decide how much more will be tolerated in terms of your dissemination of information.
[02:37:23.658 --> 02:37:26.639]  You will not go off the air as you think you might.
[02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:30.562]  It'll take a little bit of time but there will be repercussions.
[02:37:31.002 --> 02:37:33.904]  The people in the United States will not accept this.
[02:37:34.724 --> 02:37:47.348]  There will be organizations and stockholders like myself who will not accept it from Jack Dorsey, and we will demand that he be thrown out because he's not in charge of the financial elements.
[02:37:47.908 --> 02:37:52.909]  Forget the fact that he doesn't know what he's doing, and he's not very bright when it comes to political issues.
[02:37:53.189 --> 02:37:54.149]  He's not bright at all.
[02:37:54.530 --> 02:38:03.332]  But we're talking about a whole bunch of Silicon Valley kind of facty-jokers, guys who are bright in one thing they do, but are not too bright in anything else.
[02:38:03.772 --> 02:38:12.762]  Where they create algorithms that they think really are the ones that are impartial when in fact they use people and those people will be held accountable.
[02:38:12.862 --> 02:38:14.664]  So time will tell what happens.
[02:38:14.845 --> 02:38:18.669]  I'm not going to make you a specific prediction but I will say
[02:38:20.070 --> 02:38:25.073]  Well, you're right.
[02:38:25.113 --> 02:38:26.714]  I mean, our core audience has gone up.
[02:38:26.875 --> 02:38:28.996]  It's hard to reach a lot of new people what they've done.
[02:38:29.356 --> 02:38:34.680]  We are exploding on commercial TV and radio, so thanks to the listeners, we're holding the line.
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:37.922]  I've got all these Soros-backed suits that we can beat, but it takes money.
[02:38:38.122 --> 02:38:43.286]  My point is, this is flagrantly authoritarian, and so what do you think the president should do?
[02:38:44.369 --> 02:38:51.914]  Well, the president has to first find out who in fact did that attempted coup with the New York Times.
[02:38:52.154 --> 02:38:52.835]  Let's expand.
[02:38:53.055 --> 02:38:53.575]  You're absolutely right.
[02:38:53.615 --> 02:39:00.800]  That was a 25th Amendment call and you've got all the leftists on every major channel and all these intelligence ops saying get rid of the president desperately.
[02:39:01.561 --> 02:39:02.881]  The Woodward thing fell flat.
[02:39:02.921 --> 02:39:03.782]  This is falling flat.
[02:39:03.802 --> 02:39:06.584]  But exactly who do you think is behind that from your sources?
[02:39:06.844 --> 02:39:12.528]  In my analysis and what I've told my intelligence people and they're interested in hearing what
[02:39:15.390 --> 02:39:16.934]  Number one, this person went to Yale.
[02:39:28.792 --> 02:39:29.032]  Tell us
[02:39:47.729 --> 02:39:51.410]  Sociopath who's been very successful in the world of fiction.
[02:39:51.630 --> 02:40:06.893]  However, there's an equal sociopath who I warned a year ago not to bring him in, and I believe that the man behind the actual writing of the New York Times was none other than John Bolton, or as he likes to call himself, Ambassador Bolton, but he's not the ambassador.
[02:40:07.333 --> 02:40:07.633]  Why?
[02:40:07.733 --> 02:40:10.453]  Because, like Bob Woodward, he went to Yale.
[02:40:10.694 --> 02:40:12.974]  Like Mike Pence, he was a Catholic.
[02:40:13.539 --> 02:40:18.444]  Who was very religious, and yet he was a hypocrite, a liar, and a deceit.
[02:40:19.565 --> 02:40:30.095]  Bolton's whole life has been nothing but self-aggrandizement, allying himself with GINZA, the Jewish organizations, Bibi Netanyahu, and he's extremely stupid.
[02:40:30.756 --> 02:40:34.980]  In the world of national security, we do not listen to John Bolton.
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:36.982]  And the reason for that, it's very simple.
[02:40:37.722 --> 02:40:59.797]  We military officers, or ex-military officers, like Pompeo, like Mattis, like Nakasone, like Kelly, we would never tolerate the nonsense that he has provided and at the same time hidden behind the fact that he is a war hawk, a neocon, who in 9-11 insisted we go into Iraq, destroyed Iraq,
[02:41:00.237 --> 02:41:10.802]  At the same time, he insisted we go to Libya, we destroyed Libya, and when North Korea said he's a moron, they were absolutely right, because he has no idea... So you think it's Bolton?
[02:41:10.842 --> 02:41:14.024]  Why did Trump let him in?
[02:41:15.065 --> 02:41:18.586]  The reason I think it's Bolton is, number one, he's a total sociopath.
[02:41:18.666 --> 02:41:22.628]  Number two, he has strong relationships with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:41:23.129 --> 02:41:26.670]  He is completely accepted by the Washington establishment.
[02:41:27.070 --> 02:41:27.711]  Number three,
[02:41:28.624 --> 02:41:39.108]  Two of my operatives, intelligence operatives who work with me, Carl Ford, who's a brilliant intelligence operative, said Bolton's history of bullying is incredible.
[02:41:39.529 --> 02:41:43.390]  He bullies the people below him and he sucks up to the people above him.
[02:41:43.810 --> 02:41:45.091]  And this is what he's done with
[02:41:48.277 --> 02:41:49.858]  I'm afraid of dying in the dugouts.
[02:41:49.958 --> 02:41:51.900]  I'm afraid of getting killed in the paddies.
[02:42:13.556 --> 02:42:25.346]  I'm afraid, and this is Bolton, who in conjunction with Pence, who is not a very brave man, and I warn Trump not to take Pence in because he doesn't represent the evangelical right.
[02:42:25.506 --> 02:42:32.252]  I happen to live in an area where the evangelical right lives and breathes, and none of them are like Pence.
[02:42:32.372 --> 02:42:34.874]  Pence was, again, like Bolton, a Catholic.
[02:42:35.354 --> 02:42:48.599]  Like Bolton, they were both liars, deceptive, and they violated their code of ethics when Bolton was convicted for all kinds of crimes under the Taiwan Act and working with Jesse Helms.
[02:42:48.619 --> 02:42:49.479]  Well, we've got to go to break.
[02:42:49.499 --> 02:42:52.700]  So you're now implicating, you're saying Pence is involved in this Axis?
[02:42:53.161 --> 02:42:54.101]  Well, he's a coward.
[02:42:54.161 --> 02:42:59.583]  Basically, he is the one who will succeed if the 25th Amendment comes in.
[02:42:59.603 --> 02:43:01.064]  So you always ask yourself... That's right.
[02:43:01.084 --> 02:43:02.024]  He stands for the 25th Amendment.
[02:43:02.464 --> 02:43:05.705]  Alex Jones was quite the spectacle today.
[02:43:05.766 --> 02:43:14.309]  The most relevant part of this so far has been an interaction that Marco Rubio had while talking to reporters with Alex Jones.
[02:43:14.529 --> 02:43:19.571]  You know, look, part of this I think you could argue and say, why are you guys giving them any attention for this nonsense?
[02:43:19.591 --> 02:43:21.532]  But I think there's a point to this that's important.
[02:43:21.992 --> 02:43:23.013]  Here is this sort of spectacle.
[02:43:23.053 --> 02:43:27.755]  Marco Rubio is doing an interview and Alex Jones bumbles up to him.
[02:43:27.875 --> 02:43:33.879]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones of InfoWars right here in the hallway.
[02:43:34.099 --> 02:43:40.483]  I think Facebook now, I think it's important for them not to comply with any efforts to sort of go after freedom of expression.
[02:43:40.523 --> 02:43:42.304]  What about the Democrats purging conservatives?
[02:43:42.404 --> 02:43:43.425]  She's not answering.
[02:43:44.385 --> 02:43:46.206]  Just that the Republicans are acting like it isn't happening.
[02:43:46.586 --> 02:43:47.327]  Thank God Trump is.
[02:43:48.127 --> 02:43:48.627]  It's weird.
[02:43:49.088 --> 02:43:49.768]  Oh yeah, it's really weird.
[02:43:49.808 --> 02:43:50.929]  There's no purge of conservatives.
[02:43:50.989 --> 02:43:52.049]  There's no shadow banning.
[02:43:52.489 --> 02:43:54.891]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[02:43:55.391 --> 02:43:58.232]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[02:43:58.372 --> 02:44:00.934]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[02:44:01.134 --> 02:44:05.696]  Everybody should be... There's a... Look, I support going after... Is that a heckler?
[02:44:05.916 --> 02:44:06.557]  Is that a pressagaggle?
[02:44:07.517 --> 02:44:08.157]  Look at this guy.
[02:44:08.197 --> 02:44:10.178]  He's saying that I don't exist.
[02:44:10.238 --> 02:44:11.599]  I just don't know who you are, man.
[02:44:11.659 --> 02:44:12.820]  I don't read your website.
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:13.180]  Sure.
[02:44:13.260 --> 02:44:15.321]  And they demonize me in these fair hearings.
[02:44:15.521 --> 02:44:16.362]  And then he plays dumb.
[02:44:16.462 --> 02:44:18.543]  InfoWars.com, you know what it is.
[02:44:18.623 --> 02:44:18.883]  Oh, well.
[02:44:18.903 --> 02:44:24.986]  Does Google, does Facebook, does Twitter, do they need to be regulated like, do they need to be regulated?
[02:44:25.026 --> 02:44:25.626]  Who are you?
[02:44:25.686 --> 02:44:26.287]  Yeah, sure.
[02:44:26.327 --> 02:44:27.807]  You better hope you can do platforming.
[02:44:27.847 --> 02:44:29.348]  Tens of millions of views.
[02:44:33.130 --> 02:44:34.331]  InfoWars.
[02:44:34.931 --> 02:44:36.092]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[02:44:36.152 --> 02:44:37.213]  He's playing this joke over here.
[02:44:37.373 --> 02:44:39.595]  That's why the deplatforming didn't work.
[02:44:39.615 --> 02:44:41.116]  Here's a question.
[02:44:41.136 --> 02:44:42.096]  Don't touch me again.
[02:44:42.216 --> 02:44:43.297]  I'm asking you not to touch me.
[02:44:43.317 --> 02:44:44.278]  You're as bad as you're nice to me.
[02:44:44.338 --> 02:44:46.579]  I know, but I don't want to be... You want me to get arrested?
[02:44:46.619 --> 02:44:48.000]  It's not just going to take my birth permit.
[02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:50.302]  It's not just enough to take my birth permit?
[02:44:50.502 --> 02:44:51.343]  Oh, he'll beat me up.
[02:44:51.403 --> 02:44:52.083]  I didn't say that.
[02:44:52.103 --> 02:44:53.164]  I know I am, but he's so mad.
[02:44:53.604 --> 02:44:55.385]  You're not going to silence me.
[02:44:55.405 --> 02:44:57.045]  You're not going to silence America.
[02:44:57.085 --> 02:44:58.986]  You are literally like a little gangster thug.
[02:44:59.026 --> 02:45:02.507]  There are people in this country... Rubio just threatened to physically take care of me.
[02:45:02.527 --> 02:45:05.929]  There are people who feel that they are being silenced.
[02:45:05.989 --> 02:45:11.350]  He tells you China is the problem, which it is, but they're taking our free speech right now.
[02:45:11.971 --> 02:45:12.671]  There goes Rubio.
[02:45:13.011 --> 02:45:18.233]  Do you believe that these platforms need to be regulated like a public utility and how do you go about doing this?
[02:45:18.593 --> 02:45:19.953]  Well, I prefer not to.
[02:45:19.993 --> 02:45:21.394]  For a competition, take care of that.
[02:45:21.414 --> 02:45:27.736]  But obviously, we're going to watch closely to make sure that these tools that are being used... I mean, one thing is to say we're going to go after foreign interference, design, and so on and so forth.
[02:45:27.756 --> 02:45:28.796]  But it's already going on here.
[02:45:28.856 --> 02:45:30.356]  Another thing is to say we're going to go after free speech.
[02:45:30.376 --> 02:45:31.197]  The Democrats are raping the Republicans.
[02:45:31.717 --> 02:45:39.659]  Because at some point, someone has to make a determination, what's the difference between, you know, misinformation from abroad and differences of opinion within the United States.
[02:45:39.679 --> 02:45:40.399]  Yeah, and that's happening here.
[02:45:40.419 --> 02:45:42.780]  It's a very fine line, and that's something we need to be careful about.
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:44.020]  We don't overreach in that direction.
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:45.641]  But then he doesn't know about InfoWars being banned.
[02:45:46.161 --> 02:45:47.542]  He doesn't know about the top three stories in the country.
[02:45:47.562 --> 02:45:49.763]  I wonder why Rubio got so mad at me and threatened me physically.
[02:45:49.783 --> 02:45:50.043]  Poor Rubio.
[02:45:50.063 --> 02:45:50.303]  Oh, yeah.
[02:45:50.363 --> 02:45:51.464]  Look at this little frat boy.
[02:45:51.484 --> 02:45:51.724]  So cool.
[02:45:51.744 --> 02:45:52.384]  Back to your bathhouse.
[02:46:14.585 --> 02:46:15.406]  I don't like Rubio.
[02:46:15.426 --> 02:46:16.987]  I don't agree with his politics.
[02:46:17.027 --> 02:46:20.690]  But with that said, when he said, I'm not going to arrest you, I'm going to handle it myself.
[02:46:36.123 --> 02:46:37.164]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:46:37.184 --> 02:46:49.559]  There's got to be some sort of security there that's stopping him from actually... I mean, look, he's a member of the press.
[02:46:50.220 --> 02:46:51.681]  He's insane.
[02:46:51.762 --> 02:46:53.424]  He is insane.
[02:46:53.464 --> 02:46:55.226]  He is an absolute security risk.
[02:47:06.261 --> 02:47:10.723]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.787 --> 02:47:28.951]  You're listening to the most censored, most banned, most demonized broadcast by tyrants, by chai gods, by the CFR, by the globalists in the world.
[02:47:29.471 --> 02:47:32.953]  And you better believe you can bet your last dollar we're not going to stop.
[02:47:32.973 --> 02:47:35.174]  We're going to go on to the end to quote Churchill.
[02:47:36.408 --> 02:47:39.089]  Whatever the cost is, we're never going to stop.
[02:47:40.529 --> 02:47:41.229]  And I feel good.
[02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:43.150]  Potter Steve Machinick is our guest.
[02:47:43.410 --> 02:47:44.210]  SteveMachinick.com.
[02:47:44.590 --> 02:47:46.371]  Owen Schroer, host of The War Room, riding shotgun with me.
[02:47:47.711 --> 02:47:48.651]  Here's the paradox, though.
[02:47:49.092 --> 02:47:55.233]  Trump's done good on the economy, good instincts and a lot of stuff, but man does he bring in a barrel of snakes.
[02:47:55.293 --> 02:47:57.334]  And Bolton is a crazy neocon.
[02:47:58.594 --> 02:48:00.135]  I want to think nice things about Pence.
[02:48:00.855 --> 02:48:04.876]  You know, I don't want to get Pence in trouble with the media, but he said some nice things to our crew that he met with once.
[02:48:06.445 --> 02:48:11.248]  But I do see Nikki Haley and him, who a lot of folks say are going to run in 2020 if Trump gets in trouble.
[02:48:12.349 --> 02:48:14.010]  Haley always throws him under the bus.
[02:48:14.411 --> 02:48:15.532]  She does all this crap.
[02:48:16.152 --> 02:48:17.793]  I see Pence always staying out of it.
[02:48:17.853 --> 02:48:21.196]  I see the media leaving Pence alone.
[02:48:21.816 --> 02:48:28.241]  And that's where I think Pachinko's right, is that he's like the Golden Boy in the 25th Amendment play, where you've got
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:36.083]  Woodward, Bernstein, all the usual snakes of the whole deep state globalist arm saying, we're moving, we're moving, we're moving, we're moving, we're moving.
[02:48:36.103 --> 02:48:37.684]  He's so horrible, he's so horrible.
[02:48:38.024 --> 02:48:40.445]  So A, Trump's blind spot, why does he bring him in?
[02:48:40.825 --> 02:48:41.866]  What keeps your enemies closer?
[02:48:41.986 --> 02:48:42.466]  I don't think so.
[02:48:42.486 --> 02:48:43.487]  I think they say like business.
[02:48:43.907 --> 02:48:48.349]  He thinks if I bring in other business competitors and they're all part of the table, they'll work with me.
[02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:49.209]  But it's not about that.
[02:48:49.249 --> 02:48:50.950]  It's about pissing on America.
[02:48:51.310 --> 02:48:52.371]  Dr. Pucinich, what do you think?
[02:48:53.923 --> 02:48:59.969]  All right, let me go back to my real intelligence roots and get to something that may not be so savory.
[02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:09.920]  John Bolton's history is really highly contrived and distorted by the way he says it.
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.983]  But we know for a fact, for example, his first marriage
[02:49:13.777 --> 02:49:18.000]  Which lasted for a few years, was broken up because he was a swinger.
[02:49:18.220 --> 02:49:21.002]  Now, it doesn't look like this man could be a swinger.
[02:49:21.382 --> 02:49:34.692]  The son of a postman, de-Catholic, just like Mike Pence, who eventually converted to Lutheran, spent many of his hours and days at Plato Retreat in New York, swinging around in sex.
[02:49:35.312 --> 02:49:39.415]  Now, he was accompanied by another gentleman by the name of Bush Jr.
[02:49:39.795 --> 02:49:41.216]  He does have a pervert mustache.
[02:49:41.236 --> 02:49:41.977]  Sorry, go back to Bush Jr.
[02:49:42.796 --> 02:49:43.256]  Go ahead.
[02:49:43.656 --> 02:49:44.617]  And Bush Jr.
[02:49:44.637 --> 02:49:46.238]  was involved in this retreat.
[02:49:46.738 --> 02:49:53.261]  And there was another gentleman when he was much, much younger, he can deny it if he wants, and that was Donald Trump.
[02:49:54.041 --> 02:50:06.266]  So, the alliances we're talking about are not alliances of intellect, they're not alliances of ideology, they're alliances of vulnerability, which is what I've said for years when I teach at the War College.
[02:50:06.847 --> 02:50:12.189]  You choose your partners not because they're strong, but because you can manipulate them.
[02:50:12.669 --> 02:50:14.391]  Because you would see their weakness.
[02:50:14.711 --> 02:50:22.197]  One of the reasons you, Owen, myself, are not really part of a bigger group is that we don't reveal that weakness.
[02:50:22.677 --> 02:50:24.679]  We don't really want to be part of it.
[02:50:24.819 --> 02:50:30.783]  And in fact, you two guys have really disturbed the system as I have in my own way.
[02:50:31.164 --> 02:50:32.445]  So I don't work with the group.
[02:50:32.465 --> 02:50:32.745]  Oh, I agree.
[02:50:32.765 --> 02:50:34.326]  They've offered me money, sex, everything.
[02:50:34.366 --> 02:50:36.007]  I just want to go home and hang out with my family.
[02:50:36.408 --> 02:50:40.291]  And they can't stand that I don't, like, want to go have sex with underage girls.
[02:50:41.212 --> 02:50:46.074]  Well, the bottom line here is, you know, it doesn't help when your ex-wife goes on.
[02:50:46.114 --> 02:50:47.175]  I don't want to get into that.
[02:50:47.275 --> 02:50:49.916]  It doesn't help when you have other narratives coming in.
[02:50:50.396 --> 02:50:56.959]  But when you have vulnerability, like John Bolton, you have vulnerability to Bob Woodward, who wants to be somebody.
[02:50:57.039 --> 02:50:57.819]  He's lied.
[02:50:57.919 --> 02:50:59.300]  He's been compromised.
[02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:02.921]  He knows he's financially compromised emotionally and intellectually.
[02:51:03.321 --> 02:51:04.282]  So is John Bolton.
[02:51:04.302 --> 02:51:05.482]  They both went to Yale.
[02:51:05.702 --> 02:51:07.243]  It's not hard to coordinate
[02:51:08.044 --> 02:51:10.967]  One, the book, and then, quote, the New York Times.
[02:51:11.067 --> 02:51:13.850]  Now, the New York Times is a highly compromised paper.
[02:51:14.571 --> 02:51:22.841]  If, in fact, what I say is true, and I do believe it is true, then you have two people who are attempting to make a coup directly.
[02:51:23.101 --> 02:51:28.407]  That's John Bolton and the people of the New York Times and those who are with John Bolton.
[02:51:28.747 --> 02:51:30.188]  And I think it's Mike Pence.
[02:51:30.568 --> 02:51:33.589]  I said a year ago, and this is not something I've come up recently.
[02:51:33.969 --> 02:51:41.931]  On February 19th of 2017, I wrote a blog saying do not bring John Bolton in.
[02:51:41.971 --> 02:51:42.991]  No, you said it on our show too.
[02:51:43.011 --> 02:51:43.612]  Let me bring this up.
[02:51:43.652 --> 02:51:47.893]  We know there's a task force of the New York Times engaging in criminal activity.
[02:51:49.091 --> 02:52:08.983]  Literally offering people money to lie about me, and they believe they're quote, going to overthrow Trump because we had somebody, just because a certain person happened to be dating some of the people involved, went to a party where they were openly drinking and bragging how they're going to bring down me, Trump, and how the New York Times is at the heart of a coup with Obama and insiders of the Trump administration.
[02:52:09.363 --> 02:52:11.705]  I had this two weeks ago from someone that was in the party.
[02:52:12.485 --> 02:52:13.646]  So it's funny you're saying that.
[02:52:13.986 --> 02:52:15.287]  The New York Times is at the heart of this.
[02:52:16.568 --> 02:52:18.389]  Well, let's go back again.
[02:52:19.221 --> 02:52:21.542]  Let us talk about, we know about Trump.
[02:52:21.642 --> 02:52:22.962]  We know about his background.
[02:52:23.042 --> 02:52:23.522]  So what?
[02:52:24.342 --> 02:52:29.424]  Is it really relevant that he had intercourse with a number of women and all that?
[02:52:29.464 --> 02:52:31.664]  He said, no, that's not really relevant.
[02:52:32.124 --> 02:52:37.906]  What is more relevant is you have a guy like Obama who lied pathologically from day one.
[02:52:38.366 --> 02:52:57.422]  Who was a CIA operative, who was not born in the United States, but he is American thanks to his mother, who was a brilliant CIA operative, who in fact did not go to Columbia, but did go to Occidental College, who had a history of homosexual activity with Rami Emanuel in Chicago way before he ever came in,
[02:52:57.922 --> 02:53:02.984]  And had a history of cocaine addiction, as did Bush Jr., as did Clinton.
[02:53:03.104 --> 02:53:12.066]  So where exactly is the moral compass on Trump when I'm giving you this entire panoply of dysfunctional behavior?
[02:53:12.486 --> 02:53:16.488]  I have a John F. Kennedy with Addison's disease who could not function.
[02:53:16.828 --> 02:53:24.390]  I have an LBJ, a pathological liar, who screwed his own Diane, whatever her name was, the historian.
[02:53:24.970 --> 02:53:38.774]  I have a pathological father, Bush Sr., who might have been involved and was involved in the JFK assassination, the Reagan assassination, and I have a Woodrow Wilson who had been in coma for a year and a half.
[02:53:38.954 --> 02:53:44.176]  What is the problem in the United States when they do not know the history of their presidents?
[02:53:44.576 --> 02:53:47.377]  Suddenly Trump is the person who's erratic?
[02:53:47.717 --> 02:53:48.477]  Not exactly.
[02:53:48.997 --> 02:53:53.923]  Is he the only one who didn't know how to make decisions, who doesn't understand foreign policy?
[02:53:54.243 --> 02:53:54.823]  Not really.
[02:53:55.364 --> 02:53:57.386]  Did he bring in all of these people?
[02:53:57.486 --> 02:53:58.287]  For what reason?
[02:53:58.347 --> 02:53:59.288]  He's a businessman.
[02:53:59.448 --> 02:54:00.770]  He does what he needs to do.
[02:54:01.150 --> 02:54:03.453]  Does he deny he was dealing with the mafia?
[02:54:03.533 --> 02:54:03.733]  No.
[02:54:04.113 --> 02:54:05.815]  Does he act like a mafia guy?
[02:54:05.895 --> 02:54:06.135]  Yes.
[02:54:06.196 --> 02:54:06.616]  So what?
[02:54:06.776 --> 02:54:07.637]  He's from New York.
[02:54:07.737 --> 02:54:08.258]  So am I.
[02:54:08.938 --> 02:54:10.760]  We all know who does the mafia.
[02:54:10.780 --> 02:54:12.521]  We all know who does waste management.
[02:54:12.561 --> 02:54:14.222]  We all know who does the casinos.
[02:54:14.643 --> 02:54:25.571]  But when you come forth in self-righteousness as a John Bolton or Mike Pence or Bob Woodward, when you are self-righteous and you are a coward and you are corrupt,
[02:54:26.111 --> 02:54:27.533]  Then you have a problem.
[02:54:27.693 --> 02:54:30.336]  All three elements will come for self-destruction.
[02:54:30.636 --> 02:54:32.878]  And trust me, Bob Woodward will go under.
[02:54:33.258 --> 02:54:42.328]  Mike Pence will have to resign because he knows very well he has done nothing his whole life has been nothing but... But I was about to say, that Woodward thing was supposed to be the takedown.
[02:54:42.368 --> 02:54:44.510]  It was out two days and they pulled it back completely.
[02:54:45.185 --> 02:54:46.746]  That's correct, because it was false.
[02:54:46.987 --> 02:54:51.190]  All he had was a year ago's... Woodward makes up materials.
[02:54:51.451 --> 02:55:04.983]  I happened to have been on the Montgomery County Sentinel in the 1970s as a drama critic, when the head of the Montgomery County Sentinel said, I have to give cover to a Navy intelligence officer who worked with Admiral Welland.
[02:55:05.083 --> 02:55:08.726]  And that Navy intelligence officer was none other than Bob Woodward.
[02:55:09.047 --> 02:55:10.468]  There was no deep throat.
[02:55:10.888 --> 02:55:12.609]  There was no mysterious thing.
[02:55:12.709 --> 02:55:22.254]  He was getting information, as was Kissinger and Alex Haig, from the intelligence reports that Admiral Welland had created in a soft coup.
[02:55:22.774 --> 02:55:27.396]  So Bob Woodward was involved in what we call a soft coup in Nixon's administration.
[02:55:27.476 --> 02:55:32.699]  And of course the corrupt establishment goes back to the underlings that are still alive of that very op.
[02:55:32.999 --> 02:55:34.660]  Hey, you had success before, do it again.
[02:55:35.868 --> 02:55:36.729]  Well, that's the point.
[02:55:36.749 --> 02:55:40.351]  Vulnerability and sociopathy picks itself constantly.
[02:55:40.412 --> 02:55:43.674]  So when you picked on Rubio, I thought it was fantastic.
[02:55:44.074 --> 02:55:46.296]  Rubio comes from North Central Florida.
[02:55:46.576 --> 02:55:47.637]  He claims he's Cuban.
[02:55:47.677 --> 02:55:48.498]  No, he's not Cuban.
[02:55:48.538 --> 02:55:49.278]  He's American.
[02:55:49.318 --> 02:55:52.221]  He claims his family escaped because of communists.
[02:55:52.401 --> 02:55:53.562]  Absolute nonsense.
[02:55:53.622 --> 02:56:01.748]  They came because they wanted to have a financial future, which I don't blame them, under the dictator Batista, not under Fidel Castro.
[02:56:02.208 --> 02:56:05.030]  He himself has a history of homosexual activities.
[02:56:05.170 --> 02:56:06.230]  I want him to deny it.
[02:56:06.611 --> 02:56:10.533]  He has a history of being not too bright, having gone to Santa Fe College.
[02:56:10.913 --> 02:56:15.355]  He has a history where his brother-in-law is a major drug pusher in Miami.
[02:56:15.435 --> 02:56:16.076]  I come from there.
[02:56:16.096 --> 02:56:18.517]  But why did he, because I was already there with the press, they come out the door.
[02:56:18.557 --> 02:56:21.679]  Why did he blow up immediately and start saying he didn't know who I was?
[02:56:22.697 --> 02:56:26.820]  Because he knows who you are and because he doesn't know how to handle you.
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:31.163]  You see the beauty of Alex Jones and Owen Schroer and Infowars.
[02:56:31.243 --> 02:56:49.595]  The reason why we appreciate your being there, as well as the intelligence community, is you're creating dissension in a system that is so corrupt, that is replete with sociopaths, including the ones who run the high tech, that we're watching literally the oscillation of what's called the Republic.
[02:56:49.735 --> 02:56:51.055]  I'm not saying a democracy.
[02:56:51.115 --> 02:56:52.236]  We're not a democracy.
[02:56:52.256 --> 02:56:53.036]  We're a republic.
[02:56:53.416 --> 02:57:03.199]  So when Alex Jones comes in and, quote, acts funny or, you know, you can do your riff, but I know and others know very well, you want to mess with Alex Jones?
[02:57:03.359 --> 02:57:04.439]  Please, I invite you.
[02:57:04.699 --> 02:57:12.141]  You want to mess with Owen Schroeder, who happened to have got a degree in psychology and public and political affairs?
[02:57:12.936 --> 02:57:22.169]  I invite you, but don't mess with people like Alex Jones or myself or others who have been in the business of number one, creating your own business.
[02:57:22.349 --> 02:57:26.275]  Number two, not being dependent on the kindness of strangers.
[02:57:26.355 --> 02:57:28.278]  Number three, not being a sociopath.
[02:57:28.698 --> 02:57:44.526]  Number four, oscillating assistant to see- We gotta come back, but what we've got is a bunch of globalists that are only inside the system, that all just glad hand each other, they're like peacocks on power trips, and now America's breaking away from them, and they don't know what to do, so now they've jumped the shark with total censorship.
[02:57:44.826 --> 02:57:48.028]  What comes next with Dr. Steve Pucinich and Owen Schroer?
[02:57:48.048 --> 02:57:49.629]  Straight ahead, stay with us, back in two minutes.
[02:57:52.794 --> 02:58:04.704]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election.
[02:58:05.244 --> 02:58:11.529]  And the big tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing,
[02:58:12.290 --> 02:58:18.615]  To begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened to federalize big tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[02:58:18.836 --> 02:58:25.161]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you cannot violate people's free speech.
[02:58:25.441 --> 02:58:30.205]  Mr. Jones, today's, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[02:58:30.545 --> 02:58:32.067]  This afternoon's hearing is... Sure, sure.
[02:58:32.087 --> 02:58:32.407]  You're sure?
[02:58:32.427 --> 02:58:32.827]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:58:32.867 --> 02:58:35.790]  But every time they have these meetings, they bring up info wars.
[02:58:36.130 --> 02:58:38.672]  They claim they're taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[02:58:39.153 --> 02:58:40.214]  Obama established...
[02:58:40.854 --> 02:58:44.195]  With an executive order, a special office that deals with foreign propaganda.
[02:58:44.555 --> 02:58:48.696]  What it's really been used is to target domestic populist popular groups.
[02:58:49.396 --> 02:58:58.838]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[02:58:59.158 --> 02:59:06.439]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other.
[02:59:06.899 --> 02:59:10.322]  Just like Communist China, this is dangerous authoritarianism.
[02:59:10.482 --> 02:59:21.431]  And they've packaged silencing Americans who are popular and well-spoken, as Tucker Carlson said about me on Fox News, not because what I say is bad, but because what I say is effective and true and popular.
[02:59:21.692 --> 02:59:25.575]  But I think the corporate dying dinosaur media has bit off more than it can chew.
[02:59:26.055 --> 02:59:30.499]  And what you've done is only going to make people be that much stronger and fight for free speech that much more.
[02:59:30.759 --> 02:59:31.440]  But I'll say this.
[02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:33.902]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media.
[02:59:34.222 --> 02:59:43.992]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[02:59:57.295 --> 03:00:00.957]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:12.002 --> 03:00:18.885]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:22.998 --> 03:00:27.922]  All right, Robert C. Bucinich has been on fire today, laying out who he thinks the main culprits are.
[03:00:27.962 --> 03:00:32.486]  And you use that poll star thing, which means North Star, Guiding Star, but that could be planted too.
[03:00:32.926 --> 03:00:44.796]  But I agree that you've got the whole background, who stands to gain, Pence always staying out of it, the media not going after Pence and leaving him, and actually saying he's a good guy, and then saying, please, 25th Amendment,
[03:00:45.757 --> 03:00:48.483]  He's got to know though, as soon as he did that, they'd turn on him as well.
[03:00:48.523 --> 03:00:56.220]  But I think there is overwhelming evidence that Pence is trying to form a 25th Amendment move if he thinks the weather is right, Owen.
[03:00:56.789 --> 03:01:04.554]  Well, and let's go back to some other clues to Steve's point that he thinks Bolton was the author of the New York Times op-ed.
[03:01:04.934 --> 03:01:07.376]  You had them put Lodestar in the story.
[03:01:07.736 --> 03:01:13.480]  Well, that's easily planted so you can create, you know, chaos between Trump and Pence.
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:16.082]  So that's obviously... Oh, it's definitely meant to make Trump go crazy.
[03:01:16.282 --> 03:01:22.346]  And then you've got the fact that the entire op-ed is basically praising John McCain, saying McCain's vision was correct.
[03:01:22.386 --> 03:01:23.607]  Well, Bolton is McCain.
[03:01:23.647 --> 03:01:24.688]  McCain is Bolton.
[03:01:24.728 --> 03:01:26.529]  They were one in the same, two peas in a pod.
[03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:33.852]  And I think that there's another thing that's kind of sitting on the outskirts of this that we're kind of forgetting right now because there hasn't been too much activity there.
[03:01:33.872 --> 03:01:34.953]  Oh, get that off screen.
[03:01:35.013 --> 03:01:35.293]  God.
[03:01:35.333 --> 03:01:40.496]  You've got the Syrian war where they're trying to get America to intervene in Syria again.
[03:01:40.876 --> 03:01:44.498]  And they're saying all this thing, oh yeah, more chemical attacks are coming Assad.
[03:01:44.738 --> 03:01:47.179]  Meanwhile Syria is doing better than it has in years.
[03:01:47.759 --> 03:01:53.521]  Syria is being liberated right now, and they try to make up all these lies like Assad wants to stop that from happening.
[03:01:53.541 --> 03:01:54.521]  No, Assad is behind it.
[03:01:54.561 --> 03:01:58.743]  So I think also, in another angle, Alex, they want to re-kick off U.S.
[03:01:58.763 --> 03:02:08.726]  intervention in Syria, and maybe they think if they can bully Trump enough and create enough chaos in the administration, they can kind of just go forward with Syrian intervention without Trump even noticing.
[03:02:09.406 --> 03:02:16.571]  Well, we've got to do one more statement with Dr. Pucinich, because obviously the Russians are like, don't do a false flag right when they're about to get that last group of ISIS.
[03:02:16.991 --> 03:02:26.398]  Clearly, I kind of get Trump's point, like they want to keep a spot so Iran can't come in, because if we fully let Russia win, then that would be a whole Baathist regime, and then maybe Iran would have some power.
[03:02:27.218 --> 03:02:29.200]  But I don't want to get into a whole Machiavellian deal.
[03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:31.681]  I mean, even though an attack wins Trump's election.
[03:02:31.721 --> 03:02:36.124]  I mean, I've gotten to the point where I want to beat the Democrats so bad, I'm just being honest, I'm having evil visions here.
[03:02:36.384 --> 03:02:36.945]  Dr. Pucinich?
[03:02:38.211 --> 03:02:40.054]  The truth of the matter is what I want to say.
[03:02:40.094 --> 03:02:44.702]  Number one, the notion that Trump is colluding with the Russians is absurd.
[03:02:45.103 --> 03:02:46.245]  I've said it on your show.
[03:02:46.285 --> 03:02:48.028]  Has he not been kicking the living hell out of them?
[03:02:48.886 --> 03:03:08.617]  Well, in February of 2018, he literally ordered the assassination of 500 Russian operatives who worked under the Wagner Group, W-A-G-N-E-R, who were mercenaries for the GRU, who attacked our brave special forces in northern Syria, 32 of them.
[03:03:09.917 --> 03:03:13.521]  And Mattis and Kelly told him to de-conflict.
[03:03:13.901 --> 03:03:14.942]  Russia refused.
[03:03:15.122 --> 03:03:16.083]  Putin refused.
[03:03:16.483 --> 03:03:22.268]  So Trump ordered Mattis to bring in B-52s, Apache helicopters, and Huey.
[03:03:22.569 --> 03:03:33.058]  And within four hours, we killed over 400 Russian mercenaries who had T-72 tanks and artillery and howitzers, and none of our men were touched.
[03:03:33.138 --> 03:03:35.300]  Now you're telling me that Trump
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:36.581]  I think?
[03:04:06.861 --> 03:04:09.983]  I'm sorry?
[03:04:10.343 --> 03:04:20.471]  No, I'm saying, just like they tried to take out Reagan, it's a repeat of that.
[03:04:20.531 --> 03:04:21.832]  And Reagan got shot, too!
[03:04:22.672 --> 03:04:24.453]  Well, that's correct.
[03:04:24.473 --> 03:04:29.317]  What's happening here is a gunless assassination or a coup.
[03:04:29.577 --> 03:04:31.518]  This is what we attempt to do in a coup.
[03:04:31.859 --> 03:04:33.200]  That's why I'm doing a counter...
[03:04:33.980 --> 03:04:35.361]  No, no, that was one of your specialties.
[03:04:35.421 --> 03:04:38.664]  And it's clear that they're saying Pence take over on CNN.
[03:04:38.684 --> 03:04:41.667]  I mean, it's not like you got Phil Mudd going, kill this guy!
[03:04:42.087 --> 03:04:42.908]  Pence, take him out!
[03:04:42.948 --> 03:04:45.771]  And you've got Woodward and Bernstein, get out, get him out of there!
[03:04:45.791 --> 03:04:47.912]  And the New York Times has this scripted thing.
[03:04:47.973 --> 03:04:49.194]  It's 100% they're saying it.
[03:04:49.514 --> 03:04:51.135]  So I don't think there's even a question.
[03:04:51.476 --> 03:04:54.358]  The establishment wants Pence to overthrow Trump.
[03:04:54.819 --> 03:04:57.521]  And I don't think that, and they know Trump isn't going to shut up, so.
[03:04:57.921 --> 03:04:59.222]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.242 --> 03:04:59.603]  Stay with us.
[03:04:59.743 --> 03:05:00.383]  Back in 60 seconds.
[03:05:05.422 --> 03:05:11.426]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[03:05:11.826 --> 03:05:12.706]  And I want to thank you all.
[03:05:12.786 --> 03:05:13.747]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[03:05:13.767 --> 03:05:15.548]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[03:05:15.608 --> 03:05:21.892]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[03:05:22.132 --> 03:05:24.273]  And we've got products that help you.
[03:05:24.293 --> 03:05:27.275]  I mean, even mainstream media admits they have to, that fish roe is the best thing out there.
[03:05:27.455 --> 03:05:28.656]  But you want pure fish oil.
[03:05:28.756 --> 03:05:30.157]  You want the mercury removed.
[03:05:30.277 --> 03:05:32.559]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[03:05:32.699 --> 03:05:33.440]  The best krill oil.
[03:05:33.520 --> 03:05:36.162]  The best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic.
[03:05:36.202 --> 03:05:39.665]  Salmon and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids.
[03:05:40.125 --> 03:05:40.606]  The honor roll.
[03:05:40.626 --> 03:05:41.226]  Three different types.
[03:05:41.266 --> 03:05:42.227]  You cannot do better.
[03:05:42.267 --> 03:05:43.048]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:43.108 --> 03:05:43.668]  Help the brain.
[03:05:43.708 --> 03:05:44.149]  Help the body.
[03:05:44.189 --> 03:05:44.609]  Help the heart.
[03:05:44.649 --> 03:05:45.229]  Help the InfoWars.

[03:05:46.130 --> 03:05:49.435]  And then we've got Ultimate Tumor Formula about to sell out bodies at 50% off.
[03:05:49.535 --> 03:05:51.457]  Bone broth, I'm about to cut that special this week.
[03:05:51.557 --> 03:05:53.380]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:53.460 --> 03:05:59.147]  I really appreciate you standing with us, but we need massive capital infusions so I can energize to take on Soros and Hillary.
[03:05:59.468 --> 03:05:59.868]  I need it!
[03:06:14.525 --> 03:06:18.669]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:06:19.449 --> 03:06:21.311]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:23.893 --> 03:06:28.177]  This country is fighting for its very existence, its identity, from the globalists.
[03:06:28.257 --> 03:06:30.419]  And, you know, we're in a time of total war right now.
[03:06:33.243 --> 03:06:36.125]  We're finishing up with Dr. Steve Pucinich on Schroer's ride shotgun.
[03:06:36.165 --> 03:06:38.787]  We've got Joel Gilbert, always loaded for bear, coming up in about 10 minutes.
[03:06:39.468 --> 03:06:56.021]  But we were looking at the cards, or the tea leaves here, and there's no way that it's not a fact that the Democrats, the Deep State, the neocons, are in all the major papers, the news, saying take Trump out, 25th Amendment, that's what that op-ed on Monday was, that totally fake piece.
[03:06:56.841 --> 03:07:00.564]  And so who would, under the 25th Amendment, take over?
[03:07:00.624 --> 03:07:01.825]  It would be Mike Pence.
[03:07:03.306 --> 03:07:05.869]  I mean, I really don't want to take away from what Pchenik said.
[03:07:05.929 --> 03:07:09.914]  I'm kind of ashamed of all of us here, because it is like 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[03:07:10.915 --> 03:07:13.839]  But sometimes being that obvious could be wrong.
[03:07:13.939 --> 03:07:16.422]  But I don't know how Pence wouldn't be briefed.
[03:07:16.842 --> 03:07:21.487]  They wouldn't be pushing this if Pence hadn't given a nod, at least tacitly, and again,
[03:07:22.108 --> 03:07:24.570]  He gets left alone by the media all of a sudden.
[03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:26.971]  As soon as they got into office, the guns stopped.
[03:07:27.271 --> 03:07:31.094]  The left was attacking him before, but as soon as he got in, everything went silent.
[03:07:31.434 --> 03:07:32.935]  I think that tells you something.
[03:07:33.255 --> 03:07:34.976]  That's them saying, trust us.
[03:07:35.577 --> 03:07:35.957]  Do it.
[03:07:36.037 --> 03:07:36.337]  Do it.
[03:07:36.397 --> 03:07:37.037]  But here's the thing.
[03:07:38.258 --> 03:07:39.759]  I know the Republicans aren't doing this.
[03:07:39.799 --> 03:07:40.960]  I'll give you the next level of this.
[03:07:42.161 --> 03:07:43.301]  And I'll get both your takes on this.
[03:07:44.182 --> 03:07:50.326]  Because the Democrats floated in Atlantic Monthly, and at the Pentagon, and in white papers, and at the CFR privately,
[03:07:51.721 --> 03:08:01.166]  We're going to end elections in this country, federalize them, get rid of the Republican Party except for a regional party, have the Democrats break into a communist socialist and then a kind of right-wing party.
[03:08:01.466 --> 03:08:06.108]  So a one-party rule with a weird southern, you know, vestigial thing of Republicans.
[03:08:06.628 --> 03:08:12.211]  And I think the Republican bluebloods get that their whole power is about to be removed and that they're not power-sharing anymore.
[03:08:12.611 --> 03:08:18.795]  And so that's why there's a holdup on this because the fact that the Democrats are sharpening their knives for them.
[03:08:18.815 --> 03:08:21.296]  I think that's the only reason this hasn't been executed.
[03:08:21.876 --> 03:08:23.857]  And they fear the people being upset.
[03:08:24.617 --> 03:08:27.618]  Let me put it this way.
[03:08:28.018 --> 03:08:34.381]  I'm not going to say it's a wide spectrum of a coup, because I don't think they're that effective or that smart.
[03:08:34.581 --> 03:08:38.742]  It's really very much focused on the sociopaths, in particular John Bolton.
[03:08:38.862 --> 03:08:40.083]  And the reason why he comes out... No, I get it.
[03:08:40.103 --> 03:08:41.923]  They're trying to get people to carry it out.
[03:08:41.963 --> 03:08:43.284]  They're like giving the order.
[03:08:43.886 --> 03:08:44.987]  But let me say something.
[03:08:45.027 --> 03:08:51.689]  He said something at the end that only a diplomat would know when he said there's a two-track approach to the presidency.
[03:08:52.110 --> 03:08:54.891]  There is no two-track approach to the presidency.
[03:08:54.951 --> 03:08:57.952]  There's a two-track approach to foreign policy.
[03:08:58.332 --> 03:09:00.493]  And that's where the problem came in.
[03:09:00.993 --> 03:09:02.454]  Pence should have been fired.
[03:09:03.439 --> 03:09:04.500]  He has to be fired.
[03:09:04.620 --> 03:09:08.324]  It's a coup attempt, but it's easy to bring down.
[03:09:08.664 --> 03:09:10.225]  Our boys are just watching this.
[03:09:10.606 --> 03:09:12.387]  They know exactly what's going on.
[03:09:12.427 --> 03:09:14.089]  The Republic will remain intact.
[03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:15.530]  You will remain intact.
[03:09:15.891 --> 03:09:24.999]  What has to go and what you've proven with Rubio and others is that the sociopathy in Congress, in the Senate, in the political arena,
[03:09:25.479 --> 03:09:29.421]  It's going to stop in the age of the binary numbers, one and zero.
[03:09:29.781 --> 03:09:31.101]  Now, where are we going from here?
[03:09:31.121 --> 03:09:42.026]  We're going even to a higher level of encryption and coding and computer work, which is called quantum, which means that these people are not going to be relevant at all.
[03:09:42.486 --> 03:09:46.727]  What they're seeing is the irrelevancy of their presence and their institution.
[03:09:46.747 --> 03:09:47.748]  You're saying these are death rows?
[03:09:48.595 --> 03:09:58.723]  These are death throes, and what you and Owen have done is basically start to throw the sand on their grave, and they don't understand how clear they are being buried.
[03:09:58.763 --> 03:10:03.387]  I don't want to brag about us, but I was there in front of Senator Warren and others, and they saw me very close.
[03:10:03.787 --> 03:10:08.331]  They were horrified, and I'm not into power trips because I'm an average guy, but I'm way better.
[03:10:08.551 --> 03:10:10.672]  These people were shaking in fear.
[03:10:11.353 --> 03:10:12.694]  Everyone was bowing to them.
[03:10:12.734 --> 03:10:14.015]  It was very sycophantic.
[03:10:14.075 --> 03:10:15.036]  It really made me feel sick.
[03:10:15.296 --> 03:10:16.237]  I know Warren.
[03:10:16.377 --> 03:10:17.698]  I knew Warren from Maryland.
[03:10:17.718 --> 03:10:19.199]  The guy is a sociopath.
[03:10:19.239 --> 03:10:22.481]  I mean, he made his money in the business of telecommunication.
[03:10:22.861 --> 03:10:24.042]  He wanted to get elected.
[03:10:24.082 --> 03:10:25.323]  He had nothing else to do.
[03:10:25.343 --> 03:10:26.423]  He didn't know what to do.
[03:10:26.443 --> 03:10:28.185]  He's like Rick Scott here in Florida.
[03:10:28.445 --> 03:10:31.267]  They don't know what to do, so they figure they're going to run for something.
[03:10:31.607 --> 03:10:32.928]  The Senate sounds nice.
[03:10:32.948 --> 03:10:34.068]  They're there for six years.
[03:10:34.108 --> 03:10:34.769]  They don't do anything.
[03:10:34.789 --> 03:10:38.291]  Well, sure, they sit up there all of an act powerful, and they look like little kids.
[03:10:38.311 --> 03:10:39.452]  Well, they don't have power.
[03:10:39.932 --> 03:10:42.574]  The real power, my friend, is what LBJ said.
[03:10:44.650 --> 03:10:45.631]  It's the commissioners.
[03:10:45.951 --> 03:10:47.672]  It's the guy who picks up your trash.
[03:10:47.792 --> 03:10:49.653]  It's the guy who provides you clean water.
[03:10:50.014 --> 03:10:52.375]  It's the people who make sure that you have a business.
[03:10:52.395 --> 03:10:52.936]  It's the police!
[03:10:54.352 --> 03:10:54.892]  That's correct.
[03:10:54.912 --> 03:10:58.214]  The local police, the FBI, has no relevance whatsoever.
[03:10:58.434 --> 03:10:59.935]  No one takes them seriously.
[03:11:00.415 --> 03:11:02.736]  I couldn't take them seriously in the Hanafi mausoleum.
[03:11:02.756 --> 03:11:03.697]  They were incompetent.
[03:11:04.117 --> 03:11:12.141]  When you have an institution created by a flamer and a sociopath like J. Edgar Hoover, it breeds the Muellers, the Comey.
[03:11:12.522 --> 03:11:12.922]  Free?
[03:11:13.262 --> 03:11:16.284]  Do you know what Free was before he was the head of the FBI?
[03:11:16.344 --> 03:11:17.404]  He was a mobster.
[03:11:17.724 --> 03:11:22.607]  He was in a law firm in New Jersey called the Walentz Group, which only had one client.
[03:11:22.927 --> 03:11:24.729]  That's the Jewish-Italian mob.
[03:11:24.769 --> 03:11:28.452]  And you're talking about Louis Freeh, who wrote the Sandusky Report.
[03:11:29.833 --> 03:11:34.238]  So there's more connections there, but real quick for the rest of this segment, Dr. Pachetnik.
[03:11:35.951 --> 03:11:39.492]  First of all, the reason why they're so scared of Alex when he goes to Congress... I'll ask that as a power trip.
[03:11:39.792 --> 03:11:42.833]  They are genuinely obsessed with shutting us down.
[03:11:42.873 --> 03:11:44.893]  They are like... they are... why?
[03:11:44.973 --> 03:11:46.533]  We're not... Because you're real, Alex.
[03:11:46.553 --> 03:11:47.814]  It doesn't matter what your opinion is.
[03:11:47.834 --> 03:11:49.074]  It doesn't matter if they think you're crazy.
[03:11:49.414 --> 03:11:52.735]  You going to Congress as a real person shocks everyone.
[03:11:52.755 --> 03:11:53.355]  They're all fake.
[03:11:53.375 --> 03:11:54.035]  They're all phony.
[03:11:54.075 --> 03:11:55.695]  So now, oh my gosh, a real person is here.
[03:11:55.975 --> 03:11:57.136]  They're totally exposed.
[03:11:57.736 --> 03:11:58.416]  But here's what...
[03:11:59.175 --> 03:12:00.115]  Go ahead, Doc.
[03:12:00.275 --> 03:12:04.176]  Well, here's what it comes down to to me, and I've always wondered this, Dr. Pucinich, and I think you kind of just said it.
[03:12:04.197 --> 03:12:13.319]  I've wondered if Trump and other sleeper cells behind the scenes are just waiting patiently as they continue to break the law and commit treason day after day after day.
[03:12:13.339 --> 03:12:14.840]  I mean, they just keep digging their graves.
[03:12:15.540 --> 03:12:18.361]  And I think that that's what the mandate is in these 2018 elections.
[03:12:18.421 --> 03:12:21.102]  It's sad that this is what it's come down to, but basically in the 2018 midterms,
[03:12:22.762 --> 03:12:31.609]  It's going to be, the 116th Congress is going to be elected to either remove Trump from office, or the 116th Congress is going to be elected to protect America.
[03:12:31.629 --> 03:12:32.650]  And he said that last night.
[03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:35.952]  He said, if you want success, you've seen what I've done, me.
[03:12:36.292 --> 03:12:37.313]  You don't, they can get me.
[03:12:37.433 --> 03:12:38.154]  I love that honesty.
[03:12:39.835 --> 03:12:40.475]  That's correct.
[03:12:40.535 --> 03:12:47.499]  But remember, what's happening now under Jeff Sessions and Trump is a huge case of pedophilia all over the country.
[03:12:47.959 --> 03:12:53.561]  Pence has been accused of that in Indiana, that he was overseeing a pedophilia ring.
[03:12:53.862 --> 03:12:54.942]  I don't know if it's true.
[03:12:55.122 --> 03:12:56.022]  I don't really care.
[03:12:56.483 --> 03:12:59.924]  But the reality is that the systems are breaking down.
[03:13:00.064 --> 03:13:00.605]  You're not.
[03:13:00.925 --> 03:13:02.465]  As Owen said, you're real.
[03:13:02.546 --> 03:13:03.626]  You went up there, you touched
[03:13:07.585 --> 03:13:08.646]  He's scared to come on it.
[03:13:08.826 --> 03:13:12.609]  Even you offered them thousands of dollars, they wouldn't dare come on your show.
[03:13:12.629 --> 03:13:13.290]  So what do they do?
[03:13:13.690 --> 03:13:16.452]  They deprecate us by saying we're conspiracy theorists?
[03:13:16.833 --> 03:13:17.233]  Really?
[03:13:17.313 --> 03:13:18.714]  Do you know any false flags?
[03:13:18.774 --> 03:13:21.056]  Are there any experts there who run false flags?
[03:13:21.357 --> 03:13:21.757]  None of them.
[03:13:22.515 --> 03:13:32.345]  Bolton, he joined the military but was afraid to go to Vietnam because he could kill, but he sends us to Iraq, he destroys Libya, and he wants to take down North Korea.
[03:13:32.626 --> 03:13:34.488]  Kim Jong-un is smarter than he is.
[03:13:34.908 --> 03:13:37.170]  Kim Jong-un has more education than he does.
[03:13:37.471 --> 03:13:42.496]  He went to Switzerland, he understands English, he understands all the national issues.
[03:13:43.877 --> 03:14:05.791]  The end of Bolton was when Pompeo, who's a brilliant military operative, but his Secretary of State said to Bolton, cool it, you're not involved in North Korea and we're not using the Libya format because the Libya format, which was created by... Oh, didn't Bolton, you failed to state, didn't Bolton show his cards when he tried to sabotage the whole North Korea deal?
[03:14:06.411 --> 03:14:07.011]  That's correct.
[03:14:07.131 --> 03:14:23.179]  And Pompeo, who's a brilliant, number one at West Point, number one at Harvard Law School, he's a brilliant, brilliant individual who doesn't, you know, show it all that time, is appointed by Trump to be head of the CIA and Secretary of State.
[03:14:23.460 --> 03:14:24.840]  That was a brilliant appointment.
[03:14:25.260 --> 03:14:28.122]  And I think what you're going to see is mad as Trump.
[03:14:28.883 --> 03:14:37.393]  Pompeo, Nakasone and Kelly, all military officers, Trump said, look, I didn't go into Vietnam, but I'm paying for it now.
[03:14:37.853 --> 03:14:39.235]  I'm serving this country.
[03:14:41.104 --> 03:14:42.165]  I'm proud of his service.
[03:14:42.605 --> 03:14:43.425]  Is he crazy?
[03:14:43.726 --> 03:14:43.926]  No.
[03:14:44.466 --> 03:14:52.511]  Anybody who thinks he's crazy, I would love to be part of the suit to sue the hell out of them, because there is nothing in this- You are a psychiatrist.
[03:14:52.851 --> 03:15:00.435]  Trump has incredible stamina, super smart, and he claims that he's this bumbling idiot and that Obama took credit today for the economy being better.
[03:15:00.475 --> 03:15:01.336]  Boy, that was crazy.
[03:15:02.501 --> 03:15:04.203]  Obama couldn't have done anything.
[03:15:04.283 --> 03:15:08.667]  I told you he was basically involved in eight years of warfare.
[03:15:08.927 --> 03:15:19.197]  We never had more wars in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Saudi Arabia than this man who was a CIA operative, went to Pakistan,
[03:15:19.517 --> 03:15:27.229]  Worked with Geithner who provided him with cover on the Asia Society and from the day he was involved he lied.
[03:15:27.329 --> 03:15:30.995]  He's a complete sociopath and the agency knows that.
[03:15:31.155 --> 03:15:32.618]  And who's the one who covers him?
[03:15:33.408 --> 03:15:36.311]  It's our friend John, uh, the CIA.
[03:15:36.331 --> 03:15:38.433]  Forget, I don't want to get into the names on that.
[03:15:38.493 --> 03:15:42.176]  But basically, this is the man who's a sociopath.
[03:15:42.236 --> 03:15:43.437]  Who else is a sociopath?
[03:15:43.497 --> 03:15:44.298]  Bush Jr.!
[03:15:44.698 --> 03:15:45.439]  Who created 9-11?
[03:15:45.459 --> 03:15:47.220]  See, they're all, they're all our mental midgets.
[03:15:47.441 --> 03:15:48.822]  Uh, stevebuchanek.com.
[03:15:49.182 --> 03:15:50.363]  Doc, thank you so much.
[03:15:50.703 --> 03:15:51.644]  Coming up, more.
[03:15:51.704 --> 03:15:53.926]  You'll be back in about 45 minutes with The War Room.
[03:15:53.966 --> 03:15:54.527]  Thank you all.
[03:15:54.767 --> 03:15:56.168]  Most censored broadcast in the world.
[03:15:56.448 --> 03:16:00.012]  Special broadcast coming up tomorrow at infowars.com only.
[03:16:02.568 --> 03:16:06.750]  Well, I'm here in the Infowars bunker, and I'm coming to you from one of our new studios.
[03:16:08.411 --> 03:16:13.533]  We've gained hundreds of new affiliates last month, but my God, Soros and the Communist Chinese are coming down on us hard.
[03:16:14.533 --> 03:16:19.096]  And you know, I see Google and Facebook and Apple especially moving to China and helping suppress their people.
[03:16:20.356 --> 03:16:20.936]  It freaks me out.
[03:16:21.817 --> 03:16:24.938]  Because China has killed five times the number of people that Adolf Hitler did.
[03:16:25.899 --> 03:16:30.641]  But oh, because they're Chinese, it's okay, because media taught us only white people can do bad stuff.
[03:16:31.886 --> 03:16:37.632]  It freaks me out to see all these big tech companies saying, let's just ban Trump supporters, period.
[03:16:37.932 --> 03:16:39.614]  Let's ban all Alex Jones supporters.
[03:16:40.475 --> 03:16:45.219]  They're putting us in a digital gulag, but the good news is humanity is fighting back.
[03:16:45.500 --> 03:16:47.282]  And that's why I'm coming to you from this new studio.
[03:16:48.502 --> 03:16:54.027]  That we're building is one of the most state-of-the-art in the country to transmit the truth worldwide to the people.
[03:16:54.768 --> 03:16:55.929]  We've got big plans.
[03:16:56.530 --> 03:17:01.655]  That's why I'm asking all of you, however you can support or whatever you can do, we are all in this together.
[03:17:01.995 --> 03:17:03.056]  Look at this studio.
[03:17:03.477 --> 03:17:04.377]  Look at what we're doing.
[03:17:04.678 --> 03:17:05.739]  Look at the crew we're hiring.
[03:17:06.059 --> 03:17:07.340]  Look at all the things that are happening.
[03:17:07.881 --> 03:17:08.321]  It's epic.
[03:17:09.603 --> 03:17:11.805]  And then, take these products right here.
[03:17:13.473 --> 03:17:16.094]  We have the best fish oil for adults and children.
[03:17:16.434 --> 03:17:19.835]  We have the best CoQ10 and PQQ.
[03:17:19.915 --> 03:17:22.736]  We have the best bone broth, it's all there.
[03:17:23.696 --> 03:17:28.698]  You get these products, you get things that help you and your body and your family, and they help fund the information war.
[03:17:28.998 --> 03:17:30.338]  And these sales are going to end this week.
[03:17:31.299 --> 03:17:33.019]  So I commend you, I salute you, I thank you.
[03:17:33.059 --> 03:17:36.200]  But take advantage of these sales right now, some of the biggest ever.
[03:17:36.921 --> 03:17:38.701]  50% off on many of these products.
[03:17:39.081 --> 03:17:40.902]  Free shipping on many of the items, you name it.
[03:17:41.843 --> 03:17:42.884]  And we'll be able to move forward.
[03:17:43.785 --> 03:17:50.630]  Quite frankly, it's crazy how this stuff works, because every attack they launch, you bring in just enough support to counter it.
[03:17:51.310 --> 03:17:53.112]  Then they attack again, just enough support.
[03:17:53.612 --> 03:17:58.436]  You know, the Patriot in me wants to see us way up here to feel confident, but that's not how God works.
[03:17:59.216 --> 03:18:03.900]  It's you that keep hanging with us and making the decision to support us, that as they double down, you double down.
[03:18:04.180 --> 03:18:06.162]  As they attack, you move back against them.
[03:18:07.438 --> 03:18:08.378]  It's an amazing time.
[03:18:08.619 --> 03:18:09.399]  The products are great.
[03:18:09.599 --> 03:18:10.439]  The t-shirts are great.
[03:18:10.499 --> 03:18:11.160]  The books are great.
[03:18:11.260 --> 03:18:12.080]  All the material is great.
[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:13.321]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:13.581 --> 03:18:18.203]  Without you, we're not going to be able to launch this and counter these jerks.
[03:18:18.863 --> 03:18:22.805]  Without you, they're going to use us as the template, the blueprint, to shut all of you down.
[03:18:23.700 --> 03:18:35.571]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, I want to commend you for what you've done, and I want to encourage you now, more than ever, to think about what you're doing in history, and the fact that you've already committed so much to freedom, you've already seen so many good things happen.
[03:18:36.192 --> 03:18:39.935]  Now's the time to double down against these jerks, the New York Times, and CNN.
[03:18:40.876 --> 03:18:47.742]  And the jerks over at the Washington Post, and the Chi-Com murderers, and the scum in Hollywood, we're standing against them and we're delivering.
[03:18:48.243 --> 03:18:52.066]  And the economy's coming back, and people are coming together, but they're counter-striking.
[03:18:52.426 --> 03:18:55.749]  And without you standing with us, we will be shut down.
[03:18:56.530 --> 03:19:04.978]  They want to demoralize you, they want to tell you you're weak, they want to say we're losing in the face of this attack, because they want you to think your support didn't do jack squat!
[03:19:06.021 --> 03:19:09.189]  Your support has taken us to the most traffic InfoWars has ever gotten.
[03:19:09.690 --> 03:19:11.274]  And has brought in the most money we've ever gotten.
[03:19:12.377 --> 03:19:13.058]  But I'll be honest with you.
[03:19:14.079 --> 03:19:16.622]  Until they banned us, we were losing money for six, seven months.
[03:19:17.363 --> 03:19:20.486]  Because people thought everything was fine and, you know, Trump was there and everything was okay.
[03:19:21.347 --> 03:19:23.569]  And so we're still behind for the year of what we need to expand.
[03:19:24.050 --> 03:19:24.930]  We might even contract.
[03:19:25.351 --> 03:19:30.817]  But with current numbers, it looks like we're going to be able to launch the expansion and the satellites and everything thanks to you!
[03:19:31.417 --> 03:19:32.578]  But it's up to you right now!
[03:19:33.459 --> 03:19:36.443]  My fighting spirit's never been stronger because I can feel the enemy's about to bring it.
[03:19:37.495 --> 03:19:38.135]  To their next level.
[03:19:38.475 --> 03:19:39.816]  But we're gonna bring it to our next level as well.
[03:19:40.316 --> 03:19:42.777]  So I'm counting on you right now and I love you and I appreciate you.
[03:19:43.138 --> 03:19:48.120]  So whatever you do, however you do it, legally and lawfully, get the word out and support InfoWars.
[03:19:48.420 --> 03:19:50.081]  It's symbiotic, it supports you as well.
[03:19:50.661 --> 03:19:51.421]  I thank you again.
[03:19:51.441 --> 03:19:55.283]  This is quite an epic time of your life.
[03:19:55.303 --> 03:19:57.044]  60 days out from the election right now.
[03:19:58.885 --> 03:19:59.845]  History's happening right now.
[03:20:00.625 --> 03:20:01.526]  What are you gonna do right now?
[03:20:06.158 --> 03:20:10.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.005 --> 03:20:22.147]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[03:20:23.127 --> 03:20:26.569]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:20:27.350 --> 03:20:29.131]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:32.030 --> 03:20:37.513]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, still on the air, still fighting the forces of censorship and evil.
[03:20:38.154 --> 03:20:43.017]  I'm Joel Gilbert, filmmaker, hosting this hour from the People's Republic of California.
[03:20:44.077 --> 03:20:45.898]  You know me as a frequent guest and filmmaker.
[03:20:47.159 --> 03:20:52.342]  I'm gonna bring right on right now, my guest is Kevin Jackson from the Black Sphere.
[03:20:53.132 --> 03:20:56.914]  He's a radio talk show host on Genesis Communications.
[03:20:57.074 --> 03:21:07.818]  You see him regularly on the Fox News channel as a political commentator, author of The Big Black Lie and Race Pimping, the multi-trillion dollar business of liberalism.
[03:21:08.778 --> 03:21:09.859]  And Kevin is in St.
[03:21:09.899 --> 03:21:12.640]  Louis because he's at a premiere for his new movie.
[03:21:13.360 --> 03:21:14.960]  It's called Bleeding Blue.
[03:21:15.641 --> 03:21:18.482]  He calls it the movie Hollywood refuses to make.
[03:21:19.279 --> 03:21:29.782]  And this film investigates the narrative that the police are bloodthirsty villains out for vigilante justice against minorities as Barack Obama taught the public.
[03:21:30.222 --> 03:21:35.844]  Let's take a look at an excerpt from the trailer and then we'll bring on Kevin to talk about the movie.
[03:21:36.584 --> 03:21:37.404]  Let's play the trailer.
[03:21:37.424 --> 03:21:41.346]  America's trigger-happy policing is back to the fore after an 18-year-old was shot.
[03:21:41.386 --> 03:21:44.468]  A suspect dying at the hands of police officers.
[03:21:44.548 --> 03:21:47.429]  Two police officers accused of beating to death a homeless man.
[03:21:47.509 --> 03:21:48.810]  Beaten and pepper-sprayed.
[03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:50.671]  The officers used excessive force.
[03:21:50.691 --> 03:21:58.635]  The troublemakers carried pepper spray and guns and were wearing badges.
[03:22:01.896 --> 03:22:05.698]  We are not having an honest conversation around why this type of thing is occurring.
[03:22:07.338 --> 03:22:09.219]  Okay, let's bring on Kevin Jackson.
[03:22:09.240 --> 03:22:09.960]  Kevin, are you there?
[03:22:11.081 --> 03:22:11.421]  I'm here.
[03:22:11.461 --> 03:22:12.282]  Good to talk to you, Joe.
[03:22:13.343 --> 03:22:14.564]  Okay, thanks for being here.
[03:22:15.084 --> 03:22:20.028]  You called this the movie that you had to do it because Hollywood wouldn't make it.
[03:22:20.108 --> 03:22:27.914]  Why wouldn't Hollywood talk about what the cops are being portrayed as across the country and especially in minority communities?
[03:22:28.777 --> 03:22:31.258]  Yeah, why would Hollywood start telling the truth now?
[03:22:31.518 --> 03:22:37.861]  I mean, they've made multiple movies that have glamorized Michael Brown, they've glamorized Trayvon Martin.
[03:22:38.201 --> 03:22:39.382]  There's one coming out for Trayvon.
[03:22:39.402 --> 03:22:41.583]  I was just looking at the trailer five minutes ago.
[03:22:42.103 --> 03:22:45.525]  So, Hollywood doesn't want these types of films to be made because they tell the truth.
[03:22:46.165 --> 03:22:51.668]  And, you know, it's just part of the leftist agenda to spread lies, and lies sell.
[03:22:52.268 --> 03:22:52.689]  I think so.
[03:23:11.903 --> 03:23:15.204]  I'm happy that they've got job mobility, jobs are coming back.
[03:23:15.244 --> 03:23:17.765]  That's all great news that we all should be celebrating.
[03:23:18.206 --> 03:23:19.366]  But what does the left want to do?
[03:23:19.386 --> 03:23:20.447]  They want to impeach Trump.
[03:23:20.687 --> 03:23:21.827]  What does the left want to do to cops?
[03:23:21.847 --> 03:23:40.135]  They want to glamorize Colin Kaepernick and his pig socks and give him a contract, a fat contract, an honorary deal with Nike when he's out of the league, essentially bet on a narrative that is a lie about police being, you know, conners of black kids in the evenings or whatever.
[03:23:40.675 --> 03:23:42.256]  And so, but that's the way the world works.
[03:23:42.776 --> 03:23:45.338]  Leftism wants to reward the thug.
[03:23:45.378 --> 03:23:55.464]  It rewards the illegal immigrant over the person who stands in line, gets medically checked, has a work visa, and waits patiently to become a citizen.
[03:23:55.585 --> 03:23:56.825]  It rewards those people.
[03:23:57.686 --> 03:24:01.909]  It demonizes the Kate Steinleys of the world who are killed by illegals.
[03:24:01.949 --> 03:24:03.790]  It demonizes the Molly Tibbetts of the world.
[03:24:03.870 --> 03:24:08.713]  It demonizes the Kevin Jacksons of the world who want to really get the truth out about what's going on.
[03:24:10.094 --> 03:24:15.339]  Okay, well, why are black people, for the most part, still buying into this?
[03:24:15.419 --> 03:24:16.620]  They're no fools.
[03:24:16.680 --> 03:24:19.423]  They've experienced a lot of things over the years.
[03:24:20.244 --> 03:24:25.429]  Why are they still buying into this narrative, or do you see them breaking out of it at this point?
[03:24:26.503 --> 03:24:28.444]  I see blacks breaking out.
[03:24:28.504 --> 03:24:43.253]  I mean, if you look at the polls, it's anywhere from going from 9% that voted for Bush, and I don't know what that number was going forward, but let's say it was 9% for Trump, and now we're hearing numbers that are in the 30%.
[03:24:43.733 --> 03:24:45.974]  So, yes, it's starting to break out.
[03:24:46.295 --> 03:24:50.457]  The answer as to why did it occur, it's because we've been living in a cocoon of ignorance.
[03:24:51.386 --> 03:25:02.215]  If you listen to somebody like a Colin Kaepernick, who tells you about the atrocities of police brutality on blacks, ask a simple question.
[03:25:02.375 --> 03:25:03.576]  Colin, has it happened to you?
[03:25:03.957 --> 03:25:04.157]  No.
[03:25:04.477 --> 03:25:06.419]  Colin, who do you know that it's happened to?
[03:25:06.779 --> 03:25:07.280]  Nobody.
[03:25:07.860 --> 03:25:19.410]  He's living anecdotally off of the ginned up, you know, whatever you want to call it, but it's just hysteria over Michael Brown, who, by the way, got himself killed.
[03:25:20.070 --> 03:25:20.270]  I think?
[03:25:50.110 --> 03:25:52.051]  And it sets up just like Michael Brown.
[03:25:52.092 --> 03:25:52.672]  He was killed.
[03:25:52.712 --> 03:25:54.913]  They stood over him and shot him four or five times.
[03:25:54.973 --> 03:25:57.495]  His mother is crying on film and she says.
[03:25:57.895 --> 03:26:00.257]  And we carry him throughout the film.
[03:26:00.297 --> 03:26:03.019]  You get little tidbits about why you don't know his name.
[03:26:03.579 --> 03:26:14.046]  We talk about Ferguson and probably one of the most shocking revelations you'll hear about Ferguson in the film, you know, I'm not going to divulge it on here, but it will literally blow your mind.
[03:26:14.206 --> 03:26:14.906]  We're good to go.
[03:26:35.573 --> 03:26:39.537]  Okay, where is the movie Bleeding Blue showing, and where can we see the trailer, and what cities is it in?
[03:26:39.617 --> 03:26:42.019]  Give us an overview of how we see the movie.
[03:26:57.532 --> 03:27:00.475]  So there's six locations where the movie's going to be shown.
[03:27:00.515 --> 03:27:05.439]  You can go to bleedingbluemovie.com and you can get those six locations.
[03:27:05.499 --> 03:27:06.540]  And it's limited release.
[03:27:06.620 --> 03:27:08.121]  And Joel, you know how Hollywood works.
[03:27:08.161 --> 03:27:12.205]  I mean, it's roughly $5,000 a theater for us to get the movie shown.
[03:27:12.225 --> 03:27:13.706]  So we've got to get some buzz going.
[03:27:14.107 --> 03:27:19.552]  We've got probably 10 to 15 locations that want to show it again, so we'll come out again later.
[03:27:19.892 --> 03:27:21.794]  But right now it's opening in six locations.
[03:27:21.854 --> 03:27:24.015]  I happen to be one of the bigger premieres in St.
[03:27:24.076 --> 03:27:24.376]  Louis.
[03:27:25.837 --> 03:27:30.399]  If you can't go to one of the theaters right now, here's what we'd like people to do.
[03:27:30.899 --> 03:27:32.019]  Give a cop a ticket.
[03:27:32.059 --> 03:27:34.681]  We have a thing on there, you know, as a kind of a joke.
[03:27:34.761 --> 03:27:36.902]  You can give a cop a ticket, but it's a ticket to the show.
[03:27:36.942 --> 03:27:40.403]  We want all law enforcement to see this movie, because it's amazing.
[03:27:40.423 --> 03:27:41.283]  And here's what I'll tell you.
[03:27:41.764 --> 03:27:53.309]  It is a thrill ride, and it'll make a lot of people cry, including some guys, because you're going to see these cops telling you their horrible stories, having to go to suicides, picking up the bodies of dead kids.
[03:27:54.069 --> 03:27:57.491]  You're going to see cop cam footage that will have you ducking in your seat.
[03:27:58.011 --> 03:28:11.737]  I mean, we tell stories about why do people become police officers, and one spoiler alert, there's a guy that left early on from becoming the drummer for Sammy Davis Jr., and he tells his story.
[03:28:12.097 --> 03:28:14.258]  These cops believe in what they're doing.
[03:28:14.518 --> 03:28:15.958]  We have a dirty cop on there.
[03:28:15.978 --> 03:28:17.279]  We talk about dirty cops.
[03:28:17.299 --> 03:28:22.081]  We show footage of dirty cops doing bad things, and one of them was called the Mafia Cop.
[03:28:22.441 --> 03:28:27.266]  And he point-blank tells you, man, you did not want me to be the cop that showed up to your scene.
[03:28:27.667 --> 03:28:28.828]  You know, he's a bad cop.
[03:28:29.168 --> 03:28:34.614]  So it's a truthful story of policing in America that at least sets the record straight.
[03:28:35.034 --> 03:28:43.082]  And it certainly defies the notion that cops are out, you know, these bloodthirsty villains that are out there doing bad things for other reasons.
[03:28:43.843 --> 03:28:50.087]  Okay, Kevin, let me break in because we're coming up on a break and I want everyone to go to bleedingblue.com.
[03:28:50.328 --> 03:28:54.110]  I highly recommend this movie because I know Kevin's worked on it for over a year.
[03:28:54.831 --> 03:28:57.272]  And bleedingblue.com, go check out the movie.
[03:28:57.412 --> 03:28:57.993]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:02.598 --> 03:29:05.860]  Alex Jones was quite the spectacle today.
[03:29:05.900 --> 03:29:14.445]  The most relevant part of this so far has been an interaction that Marco Rubio had while talking to reporters with Alex Jones.
[03:29:14.685 --> 03:29:19.707]  You know, look, part of this I think you could argue and say, why are you guys giving them any attention for this nonsense?
[03:29:19.727 --> 03:29:21.669]  But I think there's a point to this that's important.
[03:29:22.129 --> 03:29:23.149]  Here is this sort of spectacle.
[03:29:23.189 --> 03:29:27.912]  Marco Rubio is doing an interview and Alex Jones bumbles up to him.
[03:29:28.012 --> 03:29:33.995]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones of InfoWars right here in the hallway.
[03:29:34.015 --> 03:29:40.619]  I think Facebook now, I think it's important for them not to comply with any efforts to sort of go after freedom.
[03:29:40.639 --> 03:29:42.960]  What about the Democrats purging conservatives?
[03:29:42.980 --> 03:29:43.541]  She's not answering.
[03:29:44.521 --> 03:29:46.402]  Just that the Republicans are acting like it isn't happening.
[03:29:46.722 --> 03:29:47.482]  Thank God Trump is.
[03:29:48.263 --> 03:29:48.703]  It's weird.
[03:29:49.223 --> 03:29:49.903]  Oh yeah, it's really weird.
[03:29:49.943 --> 03:29:51.064]  There's no purge of conservatives.
[03:29:51.124 --> 03:29:52.184]  There's no shadow banning.
[03:29:52.625 --> 03:29:54.986]  I'm concerned about bias in social media.
[03:29:55.006 --> 03:29:56.086]  Yeah, who's this guy?
[03:29:56.186 --> 03:29:58.387]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[03:29:58.507 --> 03:30:01.068]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[03:30:01.268 --> 03:30:06.611]  Everybody should be... There's a... Look, I support going after... Is that a heckler?
[03:30:06.631 --> 03:30:07.511]  Is that a press gaggle?
[03:30:07.671 --> 03:30:08.311]  Look at this guy.
[03:30:08.331 --> 03:30:10.313]  He's saying that I don't exist.
[03:30:10.373 --> 03:30:11.733]  I just don't know who you are, man.
[03:30:11.793 --> 03:30:12.954]  I don't read your website.
[03:30:13.014 --> 03:30:13.314]  Sure.
[03:30:13.394 --> 03:30:15.596]  And they demonize me in these fair hearings.
[03:30:15.676 --> 03:30:16.516]  And then he plays dumb.
[03:30:16.616 --> 03:30:18.297]  Infowars.com, you know what it is.
[03:30:18.357 --> 03:30:18.678]  Oh, well.
[03:30:18.698 --> 03:30:20.178]  That's why you're getting elected, dude.
[03:30:20.218 --> 03:30:20.799]  You're a snake, bud.
[03:30:20.819 --> 03:30:21.199]  Who are you?
[03:30:21.339 --> 03:30:21.619]  Yeah, sure.
[03:30:21.639 --> 03:30:25.281]  You know, you better hope you can be platforming.
[03:30:25.341 --> 03:30:27.163]  Tens of millions of views?
[03:30:33.266 --> 03:30:34.307]  InfoWars.
[03:30:34.367 --> 03:30:36.228]  You know who InfoWars is.
[03:30:36.288 --> 03:30:37.329]  He's playing this joke over here.
[03:30:37.509 --> 03:30:39.731]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[03:30:39.751 --> 03:30:41.252]  Here's the question.
[03:30:41.272 --> 03:30:42.233]  Don't touch me again.
[03:30:42.333 --> 03:30:43.314]  I'm asking you not to touch me.
[03:30:43.394 --> 03:30:44.234]  You're as fat as you're nice.
[03:30:44.254 --> 03:30:45.355]  I know, but I don't want to be touched.
[03:30:45.375 --> 03:30:46.056]  You want me to get arrested?
[03:30:46.076 --> 03:30:46.576]  I know who you are.
[03:30:46.616 --> 03:30:48.157]  It's not just going to take my birth amendment.
[03:30:48.197 --> 03:30:50.419]  It's not just enough to take my birth amendment.
[03:30:50.639 --> 03:30:51.319]  Oh, he'll beat me up.
[03:30:51.379 --> 03:30:52.220]  I didn't say that.
[03:30:52.240 --> 03:30:53.281]  I know I am, but he's so mad.
[03:30:53.721 --> 03:30:55.523]  You're not going to silence me.
[03:30:55.543 --> 03:30:57.184]  You're not going to silence America.
[03:30:57.224 --> 03:30:59.146]  You are literally like a little gangster thug.
[03:30:59.166 --> 03:31:02.629]  There are people in this country... Rubio just threatened to physically take care of me.
[03:31:02.669 --> 03:31:06.073]  There are people who feel that they are being silenced.
[03:31:06.453 --> 03:31:09.856]  He tells you China's the problem, which it is, but they're taking our free speech right now.
[03:31:09.976 --> 03:31:12.819]  Social media platforms, Facebook, Twitter... There goes Rubio.
[03:31:13.159 --> 03:31:18.404]  Do you believe that these platforms need to be regulated like a public utility and how do you go about doing that?
[03:31:18.724 --> 03:31:20.105]  Well, I prefer not to.
[03:31:20.125 --> 03:31:21.525]  For a competition, take care of that.
[03:31:21.545 --> 03:31:27.848]  But obviously, we're going to watch closely to make sure that these tools that are being used... I mean, one thing is to say we're going to go after foreign interference, design, and so on.
[03:31:27.868 --> 03:31:28.949]  But it's already going on here.
[03:31:29.009 --> 03:31:30.610]  Another thing is to say we're going to go after a speech.
[03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:32.110]  The Democrats are raping the Republicans.
[03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:33.971]  Because at some point, someone has to make a determination.
[03:31:33.991 --> 03:31:34.772]  The Democrats are raping InfoWars.
[03:31:34.812 --> 03:31:39.194]  What's the difference between, you know, misinformation from abroad and differences of opinion?
[03:31:39.254 --> 03:31:40.274]  Yeah, and that's happening here.
[03:31:40.294 --> 03:31:42.915]  It's a very fine line, and that's something we need to be careful about.
[03:31:42.935 --> 03:31:44.176]  We don't overreach in that direction.
[03:31:44.216 --> 03:31:45.797]  But then he doesn't know about InfoWars being banned.
[03:31:46.297 --> 03:31:47.678]  He doesn't know about the top three story in the country.
[03:31:47.698 --> 03:31:50.039]  I wonder why Rubio got so mad at me and threatened me physically.
[03:31:50.059 --> 03:31:50.340]  Poor Rubio.
[03:31:50.360 --> 03:31:50.600]  Oh yeah.
[03:31:50.620 --> 03:31:51.600]  Look at this little frat boy.
[03:31:51.620 --> 03:31:51.941]  So cool.
[03:31:51.961 --> 03:31:52.521]  Back to your bath house.
[03:32:21.278 --> 03:32:28.664]  First of all, how on earth can this maniac get that close to Marco Rubio for that long?
[03:32:28.804 --> 03:32:29.925]  I don't like Rubio.
[03:32:29.985 --> 03:32:31.166]  I don't agree with his politics.
[03:32:31.226 --> 03:32:34.909]  But with that said, when he said, I'm not going to arrest you, I'm going to handle it myself.
[03:32:35.869 --> 03:32:37.291]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:32:37.311 --> 03:32:49.721]  There's got to be some sort of security there that's stopping him from actually... I mean, look, he's a member of the press.
[03:32:50.342 --> 03:32:50.962]  He's insane.
[03:32:51.222 --> 03:32:53.564]  He is insane.
[03:32:53.604 --> 03:32:55.366]  He is an absolute security risk.
[03:33:05.709 --> 03:33:08.271]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.250 --> 03:33:28.293]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:33:29.053 --> 03:33:30.515]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:33:30.755 --> 03:33:31.895]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:32.416 --> 03:33:41.402]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:41.442 --> 03:33:43.163]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:43.524 --> 03:33:47.026]  Still on the air, still fighting the forces of censorship and big tech.
[03:33:47.727 --> 03:33:50.949]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you from the People's Republic of California.
[03:33:51.884 --> 03:33:56.106]  Uh, we will be taking calls later on.
[03:33:56.126 --> 03:33:57.867]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:33:57.887 --> 03:33:59.548]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:34:01.409 --> 03:34:07.252]  Don't forget to go to Kevin Jackson's new movie, Bleeding Blue Movie dot com, premiering all over the country.
[03:34:07.272 --> 03:34:10.374]  I want to talk about several things.
[03:34:10.434 --> 03:34:12.175]  First of all, the John McCain funeral.
[03:34:13.172 --> 03:34:25.001]  This past week, weekend, McCain was given a very elaborate funeral, including a horse-drawn carriage, almost non-stop celebration of his life by CNN and other outlets.
[03:34:26.082 --> 03:34:34.749]  And of course, we found out that McCain took his time in his last days to actually disinvite Sarah Palin and President Trump from his funeral.
[03:34:34.789 --> 03:34:42.275]  That was his dying wish, apparently, to exclude the most successful conservative and Republican president and his own running mate,
[03:34:44.540 --> 03:34:46.844]  And I want to talk about why this happened.
[03:34:46.864 --> 03:34:55.197]  Let's revisit the McCain-Trump issue by looking at an excerpt from my film, Trump the Art of the Insult, in the Infowars store.
[03:34:55.678 --> 03:34:57.581]  Let's take a look at this clip from the movie.
[03:34:59.224 --> 03:35:01.266]  I backed McCain and I backed Romney.
[03:35:01.787 --> 03:35:03.809]  McCain lost, Romney lost.
[03:35:04.249 --> 03:35:08.073]  I said, damn it, the next time I'm just gonna do it myself, right?
[03:35:08.553 --> 03:35:12.417]  John McCain goes, oh boy, Trump makes my life difficult.
[03:35:12.577 --> 03:35:15.240]  He had 15,000 crazies chillin'.
[03:35:15.280 --> 03:35:17.763]  What he did was he fired up the...
[03:35:20.020 --> 03:35:20.780]  They weren't crazy.
[03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:22.181]  They were great Americans.
[03:35:22.221 --> 03:35:24.902]  He insulted me, and he insulted everybody in that room.
[03:35:25.062 --> 03:35:25.662]  I supported him.
[03:35:25.682 --> 03:35:26.042]  He lost.
[03:35:26.082 --> 03:35:26.763]  He let us down.
[03:35:26.783 --> 03:35:29.104]  I never liked him as much after that, because I don't like losers.
[03:35:29.444 --> 03:35:31.164]  He's not a war hero.
[03:35:31.364 --> 03:35:32.845]  He's a war hero.
[03:35:32.865 --> 03:35:34.526]  He's a war hero because he was captured.
[03:35:35.306 --> 03:35:36.847]  I like people that weren't captured, okay?
[03:35:36.907 --> 03:35:39.108]  I hate to tell you.
[03:35:39.208 --> 03:35:39.568]  Okay.
[03:35:40.328 --> 03:35:43.049]  So that's a clip from the art of the insult.
[03:35:43.069 --> 03:35:45.150]  You gotta get the movie in the Infowars store.
[03:35:45.859 --> 03:35:51.684]  So, you know, this was a little dust up, but it was really McCain who attacked, not even attacked Trump.
[03:35:51.704 --> 03:35:53.305]  He attacked the Trump supporters.
[03:35:53.325 --> 03:35:55.326]  He attacked his own constituents.
[03:35:56.487 --> 03:36:09.837]  And you saw this behavior by McCain that it was pretty petty and disgraceful that he excluded the president from his funeral, which he made sure was a funeral as if he was the president himself.
[03:36:09.877 --> 03:36:11.779]  Horse-drawn carriage, flyovers.
[03:36:12.702 --> 03:36:15.723]  Let's revisit some of John McCain's highlights.
[03:36:17.123 --> 03:36:24.705]  He was deeply involved in the dirty dossier, the Russian dossier that the Clinton campaign colluded with the Russians to create.
[03:36:26.206 --> 03:36:36.029]  McCain was a dupe, maybe a willing dupe, because it was McCain who gave it to the FBI Director Comey, and that's what gave it some legitimacy to move it forward back in December of 2016.
[03:36:38.180 --> 03:36:47.823]  So don't forget that McCain was heavily into this issue of the entire fiasco of the Russian interference through the Clinton campaign.
[03:36:48.844 --> 03:36:53.345]  Secondly, McCain was also quite the fool when it came to ISIS.
[03:36:53.385 --> 03:36:55.786]  Let's look at a tweet that he put out.
[03:36:56.126 --> 03:37:07.710]  He went and met with ISIS and he wrote on his tweet, if we can put that up, he said, it's important that I visited with the brave fighters in Syria who are risking their lives for freedom and need our help.
[03:37:08.573 --> 03:37:10.535]  He didn't realize that was ISIS.
[03:37:10.555 --> 03:37:12.917]  That was al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.
[03:37:13.958 --> 03:37:16.100]  And again, he was being taken for a fool.
[03:37:17.041 --> 03:37:19.383]  So, conservatives remember this.
[03:37:19.403 --> 03:37:21.685]  They also remember how McCain lost to Obama.
[03:37:21.725 --> 03:37:22.946]  He didn't put up much of a fight.
[03:37:24.007 --> 03:37:28.391]  And of course, McCain campaigned for defeating Obamacare.
[03:37:28.491 --> 03:37:32.655]  He raised money, over and over, claiming he would vote against Obamacare.
[03:37:33.196 --> 03:37:34.217]  Then what did McCain do?
[03:37:35.498 --> 03:37:40.000]  He voted for Obamacare and saved it, creating a very big problem for Trump.
[03:37:40.741 --> 03:37:43.982]  So why did McCain vote for Obamacare?
[03:37:44.042 --> 03:37:45.843]  Clearly, because he only cared about himself.
[03:37:45.883 --> 03:37:48.885]  He wanted Obama and his Democrat buddies at his funeral.
[03:37:50.226 --> 03:37:54.888]  And he should have resigned if he couldn't follow through on his promises.
[03:37:54.928 --> 03:37:56.349]  He should have resigned a long time ago.
[03:37:57.409 --> 03:38:02.752]  Because the representation by McCain became all about him and not about the people he represented.
[03:38:03.436 --> 03:38:17.347]  So this was the man who got a horse-drawn carriage, lied in state in two capitals, nonstop coverage, someone who was behaving in a way that was really being taken advantage of.
[03:38:18.608 --> 03:38:28.276]  And it's not surprising that Trump was critical of him, but very petty in the end that McCain disinvited him from his own funeral, as well as Sarah Palin.
[03:38:28.516 --> 03:38:29.817]  I thought it was a great embarrassment.
[03:38:31.131 --> 03:38:38.396]  Look, regarding Alex Jones being kicked off Twitter, I call it the iron curtain of censorship is descending on America.
[03:38:39.516 --> 03:38:44.019]  Because they claim that Alex Jones did something abusive on Twitter which no one really can figure out.
[03:38:44.900 --> 03:38:55.386]  They don't talk about what about Maxine Waters who told everyone to harass government officials, resulting in Sarah Sanders and others being kicked out of restaurants and harassed.
[03:38:56.187 --> 03:38:57.968]  Don't forget that same type of rhetoric
[03:38:58.684 --> 03:38:59.064]  Let's go.
[03:39:19.301 --> 03:39:21.062]  Even Bill Maher understood this.
[03:39:21.102 --> 03:39:23.663]  Let's take a quick look at that video of Bill Maher.
[03:39:24.063 --> 03:39:26.264]  And I want you to look at Jennifer Granholm.
[03:39:26.304 --> 03:39:29.505]  She's the former governor of Michigan and attorney general.
[03:39:30.226 --> 03:39:34.708]  And she actually says, thank God, when it said that Alex Jones was banned.
[03:39:34.728 --> 03:39:35.568]  Let's look at that video.
[03:39:36.488 --> 03:39:48.262]  So I'm going to do my free speech for a minute because Alex Jones, who is not my friend, and who tells crazy lies about me, is thrown off Twitter, I think, and Facebook and a few other platforms.
[03:39:48.443 --> 03:39:49.143]  I think he's going to...
[03:39:53.226 --> 03:39:56.190]  Well, if you're a liberal, you're supposed to be for free speech.
[03:39:56.230 --> 03:39:58.253]  That's free speech for the speech you hate.
[03:39:58.593 --> 03:39:59.995]  That's what free speech means.
[03:40:00.656 --> 03:40:04.260]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[03:40:04.441 --> 03:40:06.924]  If you care about the real American shit, or you don't.
[03:40:07.364 --> 03:40:09.167]  And if you do, it goes for every side.
[03:40:09.447 --> 03:40:11.490]  I don't like Alex Jones, but...
[03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:40.099]  So that's even Bill Maher got it you know that you First Amendment is the First Amendment but you even saw this former governor of Michigan Jennifer Granholm said thank God she was so excited and happy to hear that that Alex Jones had been banned from YouTube or social media she was thrilled even though Bill Maher was making the opposite point you have to be for free speech so look Trump could be next everyone can be next to be kicked off Twitter to be kicked off the public discourse
[03:40:41.010 --> 03:40:42.691]  This is how the left operates.
[03:40:42.911 --> 03:40:54.999]  They use the tools of state, now the tools of big tech, to destroy the opposition because their arguments in favor of socialism are so bankrupt and without any basis in economics whatsoever.
[03:40:55.925 --> 03:40:57.687]  Don't forget, Obama did it with the IRS.
[03:40:57.707 --> 03:40:58.708]  People forget about that.
[03:40:59.068 --> 03:41:05.454]  Obama used the IRS to destroy the Tea Party movement in 2012 so he could get re-elected.
[03:41:05.914 --> 03:41:08.096]  The left was allowed to organize for the election.
[03:41:08.637 --> 03:41:12.400]  He didn't break up the Soros groups, only the conservative-backed Tea Party groups.
[03:41:13.381 --> 03:41:15.083]  And there was no punishment.
[03:41:15.123 --> 03:41:16.024]  There was no result.
[03:41:16.124 --> 03:41:19.347]  The media didn't care, and the Republicans eventually moved on.
[03:41:20.020 --> 03:41:21.701]  So what do we get in 2016?
[03:41:21.741 --> 03:41:24.002]  A repeat of the same abuse of power.
[03:41:24.062 --> 03:41:31.007]  The FBI, Department of Justice, even the CIA and State Department, all hands on deck, exonerate Hillary and frame Trump.
[03:41:31.767 --> 03:41:33.668]  So that's what's happening now with big tech.
[03:41:33.688 --> 03:41:36.610]  They're taking on the role of government since they're out of government.
[03:41:37.571 --> 03:41:44.495]  And if they pull Alex Jones off social media, Fox News is next, conservatives are next, Trump is next.
[03:41:45.180 --> 03:41:49.382]  Remember, according to the left, conservative ideas are racist.
[03:41:49.442 --> 03:41:51.043]  American values are racist.
[03:41:51.063 --> 03:41:52.544]  The Constitution is racist.
[03:41:53.044 --> 03:41:56.987]  So literally, they're going to de-platform America and anything American.
[03:41:57.547 --> 03:41:58.808]  And that's the direction we're heading.
[03:41:58.868 --> 03:42:03.330]  So everyone needs to understand how great the stakes are.
[03:42:04.050 --> 03:42:04.971]  I would like to see Trump
[03:42:05.638 --> 03:42:15.860]  Declassify all the Russia material, all the FISA material and fire these guys and finish the job that we elected him to do.
[03:42:16.380 --> 03:42:28.862]  If not, we're going to continue to see the erosion of free speech and the great iron curtain that was once on the Soviet Union will continue to descend across America of all places where our free speech is outlawed.
[03:42:29.343 --> 03:42:31.563]  Our free speech is deemed racist or abusive.
[03:42:32.213 --> 03:42:38.477]  While they can continue on the left being as abusive as they want with no consequences.
[03:42:39.398 --> 03:42:51.225]  We'll be right back in about a couple of minutes and I'm going to talk about the Ted Cruz Senate election and give you some real insights as to what's going on with the race against Beto O'Rourke and what's at stake.
[03:42:51.485 --> 03:42:52.146]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:04.975 --> 03:43:20.322]  This is part of a larger push from conservatives, where they allege that these social media companies have bias against conservatives, and it's very similar, I think, what you see them doing with the media, where they say that these powerful entities are pushing a supposed liberal bias on consumers.
[03:43:21.042 --> 03:43:32.727]  There isn't really anything there in most of the instances that they point to, but it's part of a larger agenda, and it's really a political issue that they're using to whip up the conservative base, excite the conservative base for the midterms.
[03:43:33.127 --> 03:43:41.193]  Look at this right here, the guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong, there's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.
[03:43:41.673 --> 03:43:43.695]  You are incredibly shameful.
[03:43:43.715 --> 03:43:45.616]  How are you doing, Alex?
[03:43:45.636 --> 03:43:49.919]  You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.
[03:43:49.959 --> 03:43:53.642]  You're going to go down the history books at the Criminal News Network.
[03:43:53.942 --> 03:43:56.124]  This is one of the main people right here.
[03:43:57.905 --> 03:43:58.845]  Who thinks you have no memory?
[03:43:59.045 --> 03:44:00.286]  I mean, look at those eyes, folks.
[03:44:00.366 --> 03:44:05.827]  If you want to see the eyes of a rat... No, I'm serious.
[03:44:05.887 --> 03:44:06.647]  Look at the camera.
[03:44:06.787 --> 03:44:07.668]  Look at those eyes.
[03:44:08.088 --> 03:44:13.329]  Look at that slobbering of the system and the criminals at CNN, all their warmongering and death and all their fake news.
[03:44:13.769 --> 03:44:16.490]  And then running around trying to police the internet.
[03:44:17.490 --> 03:44:17.950]  I think so.
[03:44:43.939 --> 03:44:44.420]  You understand that?
[03:44:44.760 --> 03:44:46.682]  You'll never have billions and billions of fans and followers.
[03:44:46.702 --> 03:44:48.464]  You'll never have people that love you.
[03:44:48.484 --> 03:44:50.887]  Do you have anything else you'd like to say, Alex?
[03:44:50.927 --> 03:44:56.292]  You are a dishonorable liar who would never even dare have me on your little tiny shows when you and Stelter called me a virus.
[03:44:56.513 --> 03:44:59.256]  You are a virus to America and freedom.
[03:44:59.316 --> 03:45:00.937]  You are authoritarianism.
[03:45:01.998 --> 03:45:03.980]  Just look in those eyes.
[03:45:04.020 --> 03:45:05.862]  The hunger to silence America.
[03:45:05.922 --> 03:45:07.823]  The hunger to extinguish the First Amendment.
[03:45:07.843 --> 03:45:09.225]  The hunger to deceive.
[03:45:09.245 --> 03:45:12.848]  But he can't do it because the fire of liberty is not going to be knocked out.
[03:45:12.868 --> 03:45:14.469]  You're the definition of a fraud.
[03:45:14.489 --> 03:45:18.292]  You are a charlatan that goes around lying about people to destroy the First Amendment.
[03:45:18.373 --> 03:45:19.453]  I haven't lied about anyone, Alex.
[03:45:19.473 --> 03:45:21.075]  Yes, you are a congenital liar.
[03:45:21.836 --> 03:45:24.378]  CNN is a giant fraud that hated the world over.
[03:45:25.678 --> 03:45:26.618]  None of what you're saying is true?
[03:45:26.638 --> 03:45:27.319]  That's not true.
[03:45:27.339 --> 03:45:27.739]  That's not true.
[03:45:27.759 --> 03:45:28.259]  That's not true.
[03:45:28.279 --> 03:45:28.799]  That's not true.
[03:45:48.167 --> 03:45:49.548]  Listen, everybody knows who you are.
[03:45:50.548 --> 03:45:54.070]  Look, as you and Stelter get force-fed by Twitter, you get like a hundred retweets.
[03:45:54.410 --> 03:45:56.090]  Because CNN's a joke.
[03:45:56.110 --> 03:45:57.351]  CNN's like government cheese.
[03:45:58.271 --> 03:46:00.172]  It literally is just force-fed to everyone everywhere.
[03:46:00.192 --> 03:46:00.932]  Everyone's sick of it.
[03:46:00.952 --> 03:46:03.713]  It's one of the main pretenders in this whole operation.
[03:46:03.733 --> 03:46:07.095]  You don't think we don't know about Obama's countering disinformation propaganda?
[03:46:08.475 --> 03:46:10.456]  You don't think all that's going to come out who's funding this?
[03:46:11.776 --> 03:46:13.697]  And your little ID card and all the rest of it?
[03:46:13.717 --> 03:46:14.437]  You think we're stupid?
[03:46:16.893 --> 03:46:17.734]  We're playing games, huh?
[03:46:18.234 --> 03:46:19.635]  Think we don't know a thing or two, son?
[03:46:21.477 --> 03:46:22.898]  Yeah.
[03:46:22.938 --> 03:46:24.800]  That's illegal, what Obama set up.
[03:46:25.320 --> 03:46:26.681]  It's all going to come down.
[03:46:27.282 --> 03:46:38.731]  You think because you've got some Democrats and some committees and some stay-behind networks, like the 37 angry Democrats in the Justice Department trying to shut down Trump, you think because you've got a rogue group operating inside those agencies that you're going to be able to shut down the free press in America?
[03:46:38.751 --> 03:46:39.311]  We are here.
[03:46:39.371 --> 03:46:40.452]  Paul Revere is here.
[03:46:40.673 --> 03:46:43.395]  The American people are watching, and they're not going to let you win.
[03:46:43.955 --> 03:46:45.416]  You called for us to be the platform.
[03:46:45.576 --> 03:46:46.357]  You pushed it.
[03:46:46.397 --> 03:46:47.497]  Now you say it's not even happening.
[03:46:47.537 --> 03:46:48.498]  It is true.
[03:46:48.518 --> 03:46:49.859]  CNN lobbied for it.
[03:46:49.879 --> 03:46:52.520]  That's all CNN did was call for me to be taken off here.
[03:46:52.560 --> 03:46:53.481]  That's all you've done.
[03:46:53.501 --> 03:46:54.901]  That's what you said needs to be taken down.
[03:46:55.182 --> 03:46:56.022]  Why aren't you taking it down?
[03:46:56.362 --> 03:47:00.165]  If I can rig the playing field and shut everybody else down, I might be a real voice someday.
[03:47:06.608 --> 03:47:09.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.088 --> 03:47:26.250]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:26.270 --> 03:47:27.730]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:28.451 --> 03:47:35.035]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:47:35.055 --> 03:47:36.837]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:36.917 --> 03:47:41.580]  Still on the air, still fighting the forces of censorship and evil.
[03:47:41.800 --> 03:47:44.962]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you from the People's Republic of California.
[03:47:45.731 --> 03:47:47.411]  We're going to talk all about Ted Cruz.
[03:47:47.451 --> 03:47:53.113]  I'm going to give you a lot of insights about his Senate race in Texas, which is going to be a problem for him.
[03:47:53.773 --> 03:47:56.753]  Let's first take our caller is Alex in Montana.
[03:47:57.374 --> 03:47:58.534]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:58.554 --> 03:47:58.874]  Go ahead.
[03:48:00.794 --> 03:48:02.155]  Okay, Alex is no longer with us.
[03:48:02.615 --> 03:48:11.817]  Look, Ted Cruz gave a great speech in the Kavanaugh hearing yesterday, and he correctly accused the Democrats of re-litigating the 2016 elections.
[03:48:13.886 --> 03:48:25.334]  This was the Ted Cruz that takes a bold stand that everyone remembers from, it's actually been 2010 since people can remember Cruz really standing up strong for something.
[03:48:25.734 --> 03:48:27.375]  He hasn't done much that's very memorable.
[03:48:28.616 --> 03:48:37.862]  People remember the Ted Cruz really from a video even that I produced called Green Eggs and Ham where Ted is reading Green Eggs and Ham on the Senate floor.
[03:48:37.902 --> 03:48:41.845]  Let's revisit that great moment when he's filibustering Obamacare.
[03:48:44.814 --> 03:48:45.415]  I am Sam.
[03:48:45.735 --> 03:48:46.256]  I am Sam.
[03:48:46.676 --> 03:48:47.277]  I am Sam.
[03:48:47.457 --> 03:48:48.078]  I am Sam.
[03:48:48.318 --> 03:48:49.640]  Do you like green eggs and ham?
[03:48:49.740 --> 03:48:51.542]  Do you like green eggs and ham?
[03:48:52.103 --> 03:48:53.925]  I do not like green eggs and ham.
[03:48:53.965 --> 03:48:54.867]  I do not like them.
[03:48:55.734 --> 03:48:56.335]  Sam I am.
[03:48:57.075 --> 03:48:58.937]  Would you like them here or there?
[03:48:58.997 --> 03:49:01.098]  Would you like them here or there?
[03:49:01.218 --> 03:49:02.519]  I do not like them here or there.
[03:49:02.579 --> 03:49:03.740]  I do not like them anywhere.
[03:49:03.981 --> 03:49:06.082]  I do not like green eggs and ham.
[03:49:06.322 --> 03:49:09.465]  I do not like green eggs and ham.
[03:49:09.625 --> 03:49:11.667]  I do not like them, Sam I am.
[03:49:12.047 --> 03:49:14.649]  I do not like them, Sam I am.
[03:49:15.370 --> 03:49:16.711]  Would you eat them in a box?
[03:49:17.531 --> 03:49:23.256]  Okay, that's the... Remember, Ted being the only person that stood up against Obama.
[03:49:23.917 --> 03:49:24.758]  And Obamacare.
[03:49:24.818 --> 03:49:27.799]  He had 100% support in the grassroots.
[03:49:28.519 --> 03:49:30.220]  Then he ran for president and lost.
[03:49:31.021 --> 03:49:34.483]  And I'll tell you why he lost in a minute, but he is in some trouble in Texas.
[03:49:35.503 --> 03:49:38.985]  And Donald Trump is going to have to go bail him out at a big rally in October.
[03:49:39.685 --> 03:49:43.207]  So what is wrong with the Ted Cruz Senate campaign?
[03:49:43.868 --> 03:49:46.829]  It's actually the same thing that was wrong with the presidential campaign.
[03:49:47.570 --> 03:49:52.012]  Cruz just goes through the motions of fundraising and giving a standard speech.
[03:49:52.774 --> 03:49:54.276]  It's the same campaign team.
[03:49:54.957 --> 03:49:58.901]  There's no understanding of the Ted Cruz brand that conservatives fell in love with.
[03:49:59.722 --> 03:50:02.525]  Now, Ted Cruz is a good guy.
[03:50:02.545 --> 03:50:04.928]  He's in politics for the principles.
[03:50:05.028 --> 03:50:07.471]  He's in politics because he believes in liberty.
[03:50:07.691 --> 03:50:14.038]  He's a special person on a special mission to make sure that the Constitution is preserved.
[03:50:15.147 --> 03:50:19.969]  The problem that Ted Cruz has, is like a lot of lawyers, is that they're marketing guys.
[03:50:20.029 --> 03:50:22.931]  They don't have to be marketing guys.
[03:50:23.631 --> 03:50:33.056]  But the difference between Ted Cruz and Obama, for instance, is Obama was a lawyer, and he said, get me David Axelrod.
[03:50:33.476 --> 03:50:34.757]  Get me David Axelrod.
[03:50:34.857 --> 03:50:37.658]  I need a marketing guru to market me.
[03:50:38.764 --> 03:50:41.105]  And David Axelrod put together a story.
[03:50:41.165 --> 03:50:45.286]  The story was, okay, Barack, your father's a goat herder from Kenya.
[03:50:45.987 --> 03:50:48.808]  You're going to bring us all together because of your unique background.
[03:50:49.728 --> 03:50:59.972]  And we won't mention that your real father, Frank Marshall Davis, was a Russian spy and indoctrinated you and radicalized you in your youth into being a communist sympathizer.
[03:50:59.992 --> 03:51:00.852]  We won't talk about that.
[03:51:01.648 --> 03:51:03.549]  Uh, Ted Cruz didn't do that.
[03:51:03.729 --> 03:51:04.970]  He could have done that, but he didn't.
[03:51:05.250 --> 03:51:09.933]  Now, I spent a lot of time with Republican base voters around the country screening my films.
[03:51:10.014 --> 03:51:13.156]  Most people have seen Dreams from My Real Father, of course.
[03:51:14.016 --> 03:51:15.577]  And, uh, There's No Place Like Utopia.
[03:51:15.637 --> 03:51:17.178]  All these are in the Alex Jones store.
[03:51:18.259 --> 03:51:24.283]  And the conservative grassroots had moved far to the right of the Republican establishment.
[03:51:24.643 --> 03:51:27.225]  In fact, Ted Cruz had played a big part.
[03:51:27.365 --> 03:51:30.847]  He actually conditioned the electorate to want an outsider candidate.
[03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:33.291]  And they love Ted Cruz.
[03:51:33.611 --> 03:51:35.031]  Green Eggs and Ham, Cicero.
[03:51:35.551 --> 03:51:37.752]  Cruz was the anti-establishment hero.
[03:51:38.532 --> 03:51:40.193]  And the election was his to lose.
[03:51:40.253 --> 03:51:41.513]  I told Cruz this personally.
[03:51:41.553 --> 03:51:43.774]  He just needed to beat Ted Cruz, the outsider.
[03:51:44.154 --> 03:51:45.755]  Mr. Cruz goes to Washington.
[03:51:46.695 --> 03:51:54.738]  But instead, Cruz chose this old-school establishment campaign worker's old-school establishment strategy.
[03:51:54.778 --> 03:51:59.480]  He had worked on the George Bush campaign, so it was just an establishment campaign.
[03:51:59.500 --> 03:52:00.240]  He raised money.
[03:52:01.081 --> 03:52:03.663]  And gave a speech without taking any strong stance.
[03:52:04.504 --> 03:52:06.565]  It was as though Cruz wanted to be Jeb Bush.
[03:52:07.286 --> 03:52:12.449]  So Donald Trump came along and said, OK, Ted, if you don't want to be Ted Cruz, I'll be Ted Cruz.
[03:52:12.670 --> 03:52:16.332]  I'll be the guy who's the outsider who comes in to drain the swamp.
[03:52:17.153 --> 03:52:20.876]  So that's how Ted lost the presidential election.
[03:52:21.496 --> 03:52:25.199]  And my concern is that he's doing the same thing in the Senate race.
[03:52:25.239 --> 03:52:26.640]  It's the same campaign team.
[03:52:27.446 --> 03:52:31.008]  He runs around raising money and giving a standard speech.
[03:52:31.048 --> 03:52:32.369]  There's no mission.
[03:52:32.409 --> 03:52:33.250]  There's no excitement.
[03:52:33.270 --> 03:52:35.311]  There's no new reason to vote for Ted.
[03:52:36.011 --> 03:52:38.253]  So hopefully Trump can go in and bail him out.
[03:52:39.714 --> 03:52:45.117]  Ted, surprisingly, actually has great instincts, but he doesn't carry them through.
[03:52:45.137 --> 03:52:51.481]  I want to show you a book cover that I actually designed and gave to Ted Cruz for his book.
[03:52:51.541 --> 03:52:54.903]  His book was coming out to kind of reintroduce him to the public.
[03:52:55.083 --> 03:52:56.324]  It was called A Time for Truth.
[03:52:57.225 --> 03:53:08.429]  And let's show that book cover that I designed, where you see Ted sitting on a dock with his family, showing off his young family and fishing.
[03:53:08.449 --> 03:53:09.769]  Can we put that one up there?
[03:53:12.070 --> 03:53:12.870]  A time for truth.
[03:53:12.930 --> 03:53:13.331]  There it is.
[03:53:14.051 --> 03:53:15.851]  So, reigniting the promise of America.
[03:53:15.912 --> 03:53:20.733]  Ted looks like a young Ronald Reagan here, with a beautiful wife and kids, with a nature background.
[03:53:21.373 --> 03:53:22.654]  This, I thought, was perfect.
[03:53:23.962 --> 03:53:24.962]  Ted Cruz loved this.
[03:53:25.282 --> 03:53:26.623]  He told me it was fantastic.
[03:53:26.663 --> 03:53:28.163]  He emailed it to everybody.
[03:53:28.623 --> 03:53:35.584]  He loved this cover for his book, which was going to tell his entire story, why I'm running, who I am, what my vision is for the country.
[03:53:37.045 --> 03:53:44.126]  Six weeks later, the book came out and they had the original cover, which I had seen and was just terrible.
[03:53:45.186 --> 03:53:48.427]  Ted Cruz looking kind of sweaty, looking kind of like Joe McCarthy.
[03:53:50.507 --> 03:53:53.088]  He doesn't have the nicest looking mug in the world to begin with.
[03:53:53.829 --> 03:53:56.970]  But this was the book cover that did not tell a story of any kind.
[03:53:57.911 --> 03:54:09.295]  And this is the kind of book cover you, you know, you come up with if you've, you know, you made a movie and you're telling a life story after the fact, not that you're going to go ahead and do something in the future.
[03:54:09.955 --> 03:54:12.076]  So, of course, this book completely tanked.
[03:54:12.736 --> 03:54:13.497]  Nobody bought it.
[03:54:13.537 --> 03:54:14.277]  Nobody read it.
[03:54:15.359 --> 03:54:25.267]  Even the audio book that Ted was supposed to record, he only recorded like part of the audio book and he had to have someone else stand in and read his own audio book.
[03:54:26.128 --> 03:54:32.614]  So when you look at the story of these two book covers, you know everything you need to understand about Ted Cruz.
[03:54:33.294 --> 03:54:42.422]  He has good instincts and he has a great story to tell, but he hesitates to do the marketing aspect to execute.
[03:54:43.510 --> 03:54:48.171]  And that's why Ted Cruz is not president, and I think that's why he's in some trouble today in Texas.
[03:54:49.072 --> 03:54:53.573]  He's repeating the same mistakes as he did in the presidential race.
[03:54:53.793 --> 03:55:07.977]  Raise money, give a standard speech with no special mission, and hopefully Trump will come into Texas and help him define the mission and reinvigorate, because Ted is very hesitant to do that for some reason.
[03:55:07.997 --> 03:55:10.838]  I want to make one other comment about the Kaepernick
[03:55:12.888 --> 03:55:15.330]  Ads with Nike that Kevin Jackson brought up.
[03:55:15.370 --> 03:55:23.435]  Don't forget, go to see the website, go to the movie if it's in your city, bleedingbluemovie.com about the war on cops.
[03:55:24.715 --> 03:55:30.519]  Look, Colin Kaepernick simply has it all wrong, and Nike has it all wrong.
[03:55:30.939 --> 03:55:33.801]  Football games are about a celebration of America.
[03:55:33.821 --> 03:55:35.002]  It's America's pastime.
[03:55:35.686 --> 03:55:37.907]  People are there to celebrate America.
[03:55:38.367 --> 03:55:46.291]  No one wants to see anti-American demonstrators start off the football game and say, F you America.
[03:55:46.971 --> 03:55:47.812]  Who wants to see that?
[03:55:47.872 --> 03:55:48.252]  Nobody.
[03:55:49.172 --> 03:55:54.815]  So Colin Kaepernick, as Kevin Jackson said, just does not understand.
[03:55:54.875 --> 03:55:58.477]  He's never had any experience of racism or anything of that nature.
[03:55:59.338 --> 03:56:02.639]  He doesn't understand that Barack Obama was no friend of black people.
[03:56:03.019 --> 03:56:10.082]  When you see my movie, There's No Place Like Utopia, I go to South Side Chicago and they talk about everything got worse.
[03:56:10.262 --> 03:56:16.984]  Taxes went up, businesses went away, more violence, thousands dead during Obama's presidency.
[03:56:17.024 --> 03:56:19.465]  He didn't lift one finger for the inner cities.
[03:56:20.025 --> 03:56:25.187]  It was all about this radical agenda that he was put there to execute.
[03:56:26.416 --> 03:56:31.841]  He figures they got the black people in their pocket to vote for Democrats, now they'll try to get Hispanics.
[03:56:31.861 --> 03:56:39.387]  They'll bring in illegals to take jobs from black people, to fill up the schools, to drive down wages.
[03:56:41.008 --> 03:56:48.294]  Even though the Democrats put up front men that are black, like they did with Frank Marshall Davis in the 30s, Obama's real father was a Russian agent.
[03:56:48.974 --> 03:56:55.179]  Frank Marshall Davis was hired by white communists to try to trick black people to come into the communist movement.
[03:56:55.819 --> 03:56:58.002]  Barack Obama, same thing, went back to Chicago.
[03:56:59.564 --> 03:57:05.250]  Organizer, trying to fool black people that the Democrat Party is acting in your interest, and they're not.
[03:57:05.391 --> 03:57:10.357]  Only Donald Trump has executed an economic program, an opportunity program,
[03:57:11.161 --> 03:57:18.267]  To allow everybody, including black Americans, to get off any kind of welfare, food stamps, and have jobs.
[03:57:18.808 --> 03:57:23.472]  And that's a thousand times more in two years than Obama did for black people in eight years.
[03:57:23.973 --> 03:57:25.614]  So I think Nike has it very wrong.
[03:57:26.194 --> 03:57:28.276]  Kaepernick has no idea what he's talking about.
[03:57:29.157 --> 03:57:32.060]  And that's the world as I see it today.
[03:57:32.680 --> 03:57:34.302]  Everyone, please support free speech.
[03:57:35.436 --> 03:57:40.964]  Go to the Infowars store, buy my films, and I'll see you in either one or two weeks for another hour.
[03:57:41.485 --> 03:57:44.710]  I'm Joel Gilbert from the People's Republic of California.
[03:57:44.730 --> 03:57:45.351]  Thanks for being here.
[03:57:52.606 --> 03:58:04.518]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election.
[03:58:05.058 --> 03:58:11.364]  And the big tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing,
[03:58:12.085 --> 03:58:18.430]  To begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[03:58:18.650 --> 03:58:24.975]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you cannot violate people's free speech.
[03:58:25.255 --> 03:58:30.018]  Mr. Jones, today's, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[03:58:30.359 --> 03:58:32.640]  This afternoon's hearing is... Sure, sure, yeah, yeah.
[03:58:32.680 --> 03:58:35.602]  But every time they have these meetings, they bring up info wars.
[03:58:35.943 --> 03:58:38.485]  They claim they're taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[03:58:38.965 --> 03:58:40.046]  Obama established...
[03:58:40.706 --> 03:58:40.906]  I think?
