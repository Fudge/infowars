[00:00:29.647 --> 00:00:50.156]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:53.838]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:59.662]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:39.773]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:54.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:01:57.918 --> 00:02:00.779]  These fabulations have been common on the fringes for years.
[00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.141]  George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:08.483]  But now, his name saturates nearly every corner of the GOP ecosystem.
[00:02:08.523 --> 00:02:14.806]  The longtime investor and philanthropist became the target of misinformation and conspiracies starting in the 1990s.
[00:02:15.306 --> 00:02:22.309]  Extremists in the US and Europe cast him as a central figure in a secret cabal of Jews and globalists working to take over the world.
[00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.430]  The economy has actually been homing along.
[00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.532]  Questions about whether or not it's been financed in the right way and who's going to get the benefits of it.
[00:02:28.912 --> 00:02:30.212]  But they haven't been running on that.
[00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:32.293]  They've been running on an imaginary caravan.
[00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:42.938]  If the mainstream media actually began reporting facts again, they would quickly learn that the migrant caravans are not only a reality, but they are no accident.
[00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:45.439]  Back in July of 2018, Reuters reported on the 193 UN member nations.
[00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:49.301]  I think?
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:15.304]  The International Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration addresses why people migrate, how to protect them, and how to integrate them into new countries.
[00:03:15.644 --> 00:03:23.168]  However, the United States, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, and the Czech Republic have pulled out of the pact.
[00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:24.028]  The U.S.
[00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:31.191]  had previously entered into the pact under Barack Obama, regardless of the fact that the pact violates our immigration laws.
[00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:40.063]  The PAC states that it is rooted in the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
[00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:44.590]  The Addis Ababa Action Agenda was a conference held in Ethiopia in July of 2015.
[00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.511]  This agenda stated,
[00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:56.124]  We will work to ensure that adequate and affordable financial services are available to migrants and their families in both home and host countries.
[00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:06.357]  These documents answer the question, how do a dozen Honduran migrants decide to sue the President of the United States of America and a handful of federal agencies based on
[00:04:08.573 --> 00:04:18.855]  And this is nothing new to Soros and USAID, who funneled money to aid Georgia's Rose Revolution in 2003, the Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004, and Kyrgyzstan's Tulip Revolution in 2005.
[00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:41.562]  Recently, Judicial Watch used a FOIA request to uncover how U.S.
[00:04:41.662 --> 00:04:49.748]  aid funds were funneled to Soros' left-wing Open Society foundations in Albania, particularly the Soros operation.
[00:04:49.908 --> 00:04:56.873]  Ladies and gentlemen, the name of this video is George Soros' Caravans Meet the InfoWalk.
[00:04:57.733 --> 00:04:58.554]  We're one day out.
[00:04:58.634 --> 00:04:59.955]  It's historic election coverage.
[00:05:00.055 --> 00:05:01.196]  Ted Nugent, straight ahead.
[00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:12.466]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:14.768]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:21.454]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:05:22.114 --> 00:05:27.937]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:05:28.397 --> 00:05:34.020]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:41.704]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:55.389]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.670]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.891]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[00:06:09.628 --> 00:06:24.035]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:36.961]  We are now only one day out from what even the Financial Times of London is calling the most important election in world history, a referendum on nationalism versus globalism.
[00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:52.362]  And American hating forces around the world have come out of the woodwork to try to bring this country to its knees and stop the recovery before we can totally turn the nation around and prove they were trying to bankrupt us by design.
[00:06:52.902 --> 00:06:55.523]  Mike Adams has written a key report for Infowars.com.
[00:06:55.563 --> 00:06:56.403]  It's on Natural News.
[00:06:56.783 --> 00:07:05.225]  Win or lose, it's time for America to push back against the incivility, lawlessness, and the fraud of the political left.
[00:07:05.845 --> 00:07:15.772]  Yes, the election meddling, the bullying, the foreign meddling, the racketeering, and Trump administration eyes big tech antitrust violations.
[00:07:16.173 --> 00:07:23.198]  CNBC, after the election, Trump is going to strike back and we've been quarterbacking that operation.
[00:07:23.258 --> 00:07:32.064]  Maxine Waters has sworn that if she gets control of the House Financial Services Committee, she will wreck the economy and stop the recovery.
[00:07:32.124 --> 00:07:33.945]  That is their main job.
[00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:34.506]  Also,
[00:07:36.015 --> 00:07:43.396]  Paul Joseph Watson has a key report up on Infowars.com that is so incredibly important.
[00:07:45.057 --> 00:07:50.658]  Shock Rasmussen poll puts Republicans one point ahead in race for Congress.
[00:07:50.678 --> 00:08:04.760]  You have to understand, all of these polling agencies, depending on the methodology poll, 9 to 15, some cases 20 points more
[00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:08.457]  For Democrats.
[00:08:09.418 --> 00:08:13.040]  They just believe that there are more Democrats than there are Republicans.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.800]  That's not true.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:22.445]  So when you've got Republicans in a National Scientific Rasmussen Poll one point ahead, that is massive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:27.013]  That signals a major red wave, but here's the problem.
[00:08:27.754 --> 00:08:39.029]  They have caught people from Texas to Maryland, Democrats organizing legal aliens to have mailed to their address absentee ballots in the name of dead people, stolen the rolls.
[00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:45.075]  You've got all sorts of foreign money and suppression and free speech suppression going on.
[00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:54.404]  So can the bullying and racketeering and the new Black Panther Party standing up front polling places with rifles, can that intimidate people from voting?
[00:08:54.684 --> 00:08:57.586]  And will the Democrats be able to steal another election?
[00:08:57.927 --> 00:09:00.449]  Joining us is Ted Nugent for the next two segments.
[00:09:00.789 --> 00:09:04.493]  I can't think of a better way to have the Motor City madman kick off
[00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:16.241]  Our final day of coverage before this incredible election kicks off, and I gotta tell ya, I'm not somebody that has anxiety or butterflies, but I gotta tell ya, I am really on edge.
[00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:19.242]  You can cut the energy with a knife.
[00:09:20.383 --> 00:09:26.347]  We're gonna be talking about all this with Ted Nugent and get his prediction of what's gonna happen tomorrow.
[00:09:26.587 --> 00:09:27.368]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:29.383]  My pleasure, Alex.
[00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:32.904]  Happy November 5th to you, and thanks for being on the front lines.
[00:09:32.944 --> 00:09:37.486]  If I may just state that this isn't just a Ted Nugent opinion.
[00:09:37.526 --> 00:09:39.147]  Again, I'm a gregarious guy.
[00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:53.394]  We have hunting camps full of great families up here in the swamps and forests of Michigan, and we want you to know, Alex, that we believe the Founding Fathers wanted all Americans to be like Alex Jones, and we the people
[00:09:53.814 --> 00:09:59.616]  Spotlighting the cockroaches that threaten freedom and life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that is the American dream.
[00:10:00.076 --> 00:10:02.397]  So thank you for being a hell-raiser.
[00:10:02.778 --> 00:10:06.399]  We the people are supposed to be hell-raisers.
[00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:10.581]  We're not supposed to be French, we're not supposed to be British, we're not supposed to be German.
[00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:18.944]  We're supposed to be free Americans raising hell, questioning authority every minute of the day, and spotlighting
[00:10:19.224 --> 00:10:20.005]  We're good to go.
[00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:42.086]  Wow, I'll be Ted Nugent like you meant it.
[00:10:42.126 --> 00:10:43.247]  All of that back at you, my friend.
[00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:45.049]  Let me ask you this fundamental question.
[00:10:45.609 --> 00:10:47.610]  You've talked for 45, 50 years.
[00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:52.734]  You really were the first person for the relaunch of the Republic to bring back Americana when it wasn't cool in the 60s.
[00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:59.302]  To recognize that leftists hated America, and literally had a vendetta against it.
[00:10:59.422 --> 00:11:09.790]  Now, when a member of CNBC says we appreciate Navy SEAL service that lost his eye, when the left is making fun of him losing his eye, she gets in trouble.
[00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:15.655]  I mean, you go to a Democrat event, and you say America's back, and they literally kiss and boo.
[00:11:16.256 --> 00:11:17.837]  What is wrong with these people?
[00:11:17.897 --> 00:11:21.320]  How did they get brainwashed into this position, and as they're
[00:11:22.781 --> 00:11:25.643]  Numbers grow as they bring in more people to brainwash.
[00:11:25.903 --> 00:11:26.924]  Where does all this end?
[00:11:27.784 --> 00:11:47.859]  You know, it's impossible to really analyze the system and the procedure by which people can lose their soul to the degree where an American, an actual born American, is upset by a Donald Trump statement of America first.
[00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:58.986]  All you need to know about Robert O'Rourke down there in Texas and Debbie Stabenow up here in Michigan, it's very interesting, Alex, that I have a foot in both camps.
[00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:17.899]  I'm here in my beloved birth state of Michigan, which I truly love, and we have a hunting season here to celebrate every year for 70 years, and then I'm a resident of Texas, which is the front lines, where the left dreams that they can turn Texas
[00:12:20.521 --> 00:12:46.041]  So the observation should never be predicated upon our desire or need to understand how you lose your soul, how an American can hate the battle cry of America First, how the media and Beto O'Rourke and the Hillary Clintons and the gun-running Barack Obama and Eric Holders of the world can actually insert the word white
[00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:51.002]  Into Donald Trump's statement that he loves America because he's a nationalist.
[00:12:51.282 --> 00:12:52.362]  He loves America.
[00:12:52.642 --> 00:12:58.523]  He loves everybody in America, no matter race, color, creed, gender confusion, ethnicity.
[00:12:59.043 --> 00:13:05.424]  No separation of why Donald Trump and Alex Jones and Ted Nugent love America.
[00:13:05.504 --> 00:13:06.685]  We are nationalists.
[00:13:07.005 --> 00:13:10.365]  We love America more than we love the rest of the world.
[00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:13.446]  And then the lying scum
[00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:19.415]  The anti-journalist fake news masters of Don Lemon and all the left.
[00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:28.566]  They literally take Donald Trump's statement that I love America, I'm an American nationalist, and they insert the word white.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.962]  Nobody ever said they were a white nationalist.
[00:13:33.403 --> 00:13:38.346]  Nobody ever said all the immigrants are rapists and murderers and thieves and drug runners.
[00:13:38.766 --> 00:13:48.112]  The only people that Donald Trump called rapists and murderers and thieves and drug runners were the rapists and thieves and murderers and drug runners.
[00:13:48.433 --> 00:13:56.378]  Yet the left, just like hands up don't shoot lie, they have to lie and then their sheep
[00:13:56.998 --> 00:14:07.327]  Blindly follow them, but Alex, you will have an aneurysm if you try to determine how a person loses their soul.
[00:14:07.727 --> 00:14:12.011]  So instead of trying to come up with some kind of logic that doesn't exist... Just defeat them.
[00:14:13.372 --> 00:14:14.293]  Just defeat them.
[00:14:14.613 --> 00:14:17.295]  We need to galvanize everybody in our lives.
[00:14:17.395 --> 00:14:20.017]  Church, school, the workplace, the family gatherings.
[00:14:20.037 --> 00:14:20.898]  We're in a fight.
[00:14:20.998 --> 00:14:21.999]  And we need to fix liberals.
[00:14:22.349 --> 00:14:26.070]  We're in a war, and we're about to go to break one more segment, and I appreciate your time, but I wanted to ask you this.
[00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:44.154]  Brett Kavanaugh, a third woman has come out, because they're about to get indicted, and said, I totally made it up, but she said, I never even met him, but it's okay, because she said, I just wanted to use it as a tactic to ruin his wife, his children, try to ruin his life, but as soon as they failed, they just withdrew it, and now they've been caught making it up.
[00:14:45.894 --> 00:14:46.194]  Sure!
[00:14:46.275 --> 00:14:47.516]  Well, they've been doing that about me.
[00:14:47.536 --> 00:14:53.884]  I mean, the Huffington Post actually wrote a story that I adopted a 13-year-old to have sex with her.
[00:14:54.901 --> 00:14:58.503]  Alex, where the hell do they come up with this stuff?
[00:14:58.684 --> 00:14:59.504]  And you know why?
[00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:06.288]  They say that against me in the protection of their First Amendment maneuvers because they can't debate me.
[00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:10.911]  They've seen when leftists try to debate Ted Nugent and get their ass handed to them.
[00:15:10.931 --> 00:15:11.672]  Ted, Ted, I looked into that.
[00:15:11.732 --> 00:15:12.512]  It's totally made up.
[00:15:12.592 --> 00:15:17.235]  They say that I say that there are Martian slave colonies on the moon.
[00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:18.196]  Never said it.
[00:15:20.397 --> 00:15:28.824]  You gotta admit this, if you can get past the insanity and the cruelty and the soullessness of the left, it's some funny, funny stuff.
[00:15:29.545 --> 00:15:35.069]  I know, it's like, they publish an article that I wear Nazi tennis shoes around the office.
[00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.631]  That's how they operate.
[00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:39.993]  They're liars, they're fake newsmasters.
[00:15:40.033 --> 00:15:42.235]  I've been dealing with it since the 1960s.
[00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:46.258]  They hated me because I believe in the Second Amendment and I eat venison.
[00:15:46.558 --> 00:15:49.421]  Just for that, I'm gonna buy more guns and kill more deer.
[00:15:50.143 --> 00:15:53.765]  Let's talk about other key issues straight ahead with The Man.
[00:15:54.085 --> 00:15:55.225]  Ted Nugent, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:15:55.485 --> 00:15:56.286]  Spread the live link.
[00:15:56.386 --> 00:15:57.326]  Break the censors back.
[00:15:57.706 --> 00:15:59.827]  Infowars.com forward slash show live coverage.
[00:16:09.773 --> 00:16:14.356]  That I almost don't want to play 2001 Space Odyssey music to build it up.
[00:16:14.376 --> 00:16:14.896]  But you know what?
[00:16:15.837 --> 00:16:17.918]  Simplicity and truth deserves it.
[00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:25.163]  Introducing Survival Shield X3 iodine in an energized quantum state.
[00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:26.984]  Or an atomic state.
[00:16:27.164 --> 00:16:29.386]  That doesn't mean radioactive, it means elemental.
[00:16:30.006 --> 00:16:38.491]  All three forms, including deep earth crystal iodine, two other forms and a tiny amount of vitamin C, to stop it from oxidizing and keep it in that
[00:16:39.572 --> 00:16:49.735]  State of true purity so that when it hits your cells when it goes into your body it has the amazing effect We all need oxygen to live on this planet.
[00:16:49.755 --> 00:16:51.636]  We all need water to live.
[00:16:51.656 --> 00:17:01.639]  We all need food But there are other key building blocks other key elements that if we don't have them Well, we got a big problem
[00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:07.396]  And Survival Shield X3 is the next level of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:07.897 --> 00:17:14.800]  And what we've been able to develop and come up with takes the game-changing, trailblazing,
[00:17:16.432 --> 00:17:20.697]  Things that we witnessed with X2, and it takes it to a whole other level.
[00:17:20.878 --> 00:17:32.291]  We have a two ounce bottles, we have a one ounce bottles, and this is the best thing of scientists, chemists, researchers, to come up with a formula that is beyond true iodine.
[00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:36.035]  It is all forms of it, energized,
[00:17:37.285 --> 00:17:39.629]  Active and ready to energize the body.
[00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:44.818]  The iodine in X3 comes from thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:45.980]  Hit!
[00:17:47.134 --> 00:17:53.536]  From the oxygenation and radiation and toxins that are on the surface for tens of thousands of years.
[00:17:54.657 --> 00:18:02.600]  X3, ladies and gentlemen, is the, from our research, ultimate form of true atomic iodine.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:09.322]  Fused with other forms of iodine and vitamin C to keep it in its energetic state.
[00:18:10.612 --> 00:18:17.859]  Look, I've got piles of papers and research and scientists I've been talking to for years, and to try to put it all in just a few minutes is impossible.
[00:18:18.399 --> 00:18:19.340]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:23.244]  The globalists are pumping our environment full of bad halogens.
[00:18:23.424 --> 00:18:24.485]  Fluoride is just part of that.
[00:18:26.567 --> 00:18:31.371]  Iodine is the good halogen that the human body absolutely has to have to operate.
[00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:35.634]  And they have done everything they can to take that out of the environment.
[00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:42.502]  So our quest to bring people the very best supplements, the very best nutraceuticals, it was clear that iodine was critical.
[00:18:43.463 --> 00:18:47.488]  And we've gone through several permutations, and our research just gets better and better and better.
[00:18:47.788 --> 00:18:49.970]  And every time you reformulate, you give it a new name.
[00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:52.814]  Well, X3 is a quantum leap.
[00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:55.882]  From X1 and X2.
[00:18:56.542 --> 00:18:57.823]  And it's simply incredible.
[00:18:58.383 --> 00:19:00.744]  It's exclusively available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:06.327]  I want you to go research it, look at the facts for yourself, but it is amazing.
[00:19:07.028 --> 00:19:13.931]  And what it's done for my stamina, my focus, my libido, everything is just incredible.
[00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:14.872]  And then I realized why.
[00:19:15.632 --> 00:19:25.008]  The globalists have wanted to get it out of the food and out of the water and out of the food chain for 50, 60 years because iodine, for me, is like oxygen.
[00:19:27.009 --> 00:19:27.810]  It energizes.
[00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.191]  It gives life.
[00:19:29.311 --> 00:19:30.492]  It's everything.
[00:19:31.112 --> 00:19:41.260]  In your quest to have a better life for you, your family, your children, your wife, your husband, your co-workers, the military, police, you need to take care of yourselves, and iodine is the missing link.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:41.840]  It's X3.
[00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:44.142]  It's available at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:19:44.763 --> 00:19:53.229]  In 2-ounce and 1-ounce, it's 50% off out of the gates and free shipping as our newest special at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:53.469 --> 00:19:55.211]  I want you to experience.
[00:19:55.931 --> 00:19:59.472]  This critical element that you're supposed to have for yourself.
[00:20:04.974 --> 00:20:11.215]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.257 --> 00:20:16.637]  They think you're a goldfish!
[00:20:18.257 --> 00:20:20.338]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[00:20:20.598 --> 00:20:21.698]  I believe in you!
[00:20:21.718 --> 00:20:23.179]  I don't think you're stupid!
[00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:27.891]  One man ever raped a woman!
[00:20:28.212 --> 00:20:29.833]  All genitals were cut off!
[00:20:30.073 --> 00:20:32.516]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[00:20:32.636 --> 00:20:33.837]  And we're not backing down ever!
[00:20:34.718 --> 00:20:36.920]  I wanna kick these people!
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.461]  We're winning!
[00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:38.622]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[00:20:38.782 --> 00:20:39.222]  Can't you?
[00:20:39.242 --> 00:20:39.282]  We...
[00:20:50.179 --> 00:20:53.164]  That's me getting very excited listening to Stranglehold a few months ago.
[00:20:53.184 --> 00:20:54.746]  Ted Nugent sarcastic.
[00:20:54.806 --> 00:20:55.968]  I can make a fool out of myself.
[00:20:56.248 --> 00:20:58.131]  But it's all fun, isn't it?
[00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:01.416]  Ted, we were talking during the break and I was asking your gut level.
[00:21:02.768 --> 00:21:07.932]  On what's going to happen tomorrow and what people need to do regardless.
[00:21:07.972 --> 00:21:16.339]  We have a dangerous, lawless, insane, attack dog, parasitic group of leftists in this country that literally want to conquer everybody.
[00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.601]  Like you were saying, they want to conquer Texas.
[00:21:18.621 --> 00:21:19.382]  They're obsessed with it.
[00:21:19.402 --> 00:21:20.923]  They want to steal the resources.
[00:21:20.943 --> 00:21:22.704]  They've already destroyed California.
[00:21:22.744 --> 00:21:24.886]  Now they're moving here like locusts.
[00:21:24.946 --> 00:21:25.567]  It's incredible.
[00:21:26.027 --> 00:21:28.148]  Oh, by the way, I should add, your new album is about to come out.
[00:21:28.389 --> 00:21:30.690]  But you heard some of the new tunes a few months ago at your house.
[00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.452]  It is absolutely a powerhouse.
[00:21:33.832 --> 00:21:34.993]  The music made me do it.
[00:21:35.013 --> 00:21:35.934]  Tell us about that first.
[00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:38.154]  Well, the music made me do it.
[00:21:38.174 --> 00:21:41.335]  I think that's a battle cry that we can all shout loud and proud.
[00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:42.996]  I mean, the music does make us do it.
[00:21:43.036 --> 00:21:47.618]  It's a great, great audio soundtrack to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:47.678 --> 00:21:57.543]  And I've got the world's greatest driving, grinding, barbecuing band in the world, Greg Smith on bass, and Jason Hartley's this young whippersnapper from the Motor City on drums.
[00:21:58.123 --> 00:22:03.746]  And I just had the greatest tour of my life in 2018, which is truly a phenomenal statement, but actually...
[00:22:04.586 --> 00:22:05.307]  We're good to go.
[00:22:22.828 --> 00:22:32.182]  I witness a lot of that enthusiasm and passion, the same you have for getting the truth out that I have for making that Gibson guitar lay down the soundtrack.
[00:22:32.502 --> 00:22:38.571]  I get it from welders and mechanics and plumbers and electricians and farmers and ranchers and teachers and cops.
[00:22:39.151 --> 00:23:05.183]  All across this country, but I think the most important battle cry right now, going from my new record to the importance of this midterm election, Alex, and that is that if people in the asset column, working hard, playing hard, entrepreneurs and just employed producers in America, if just, how about this, if just the licensed hunters in America,
[00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:23.324]  Would vote, conservative, Constitution, Bill of Rights, Golden Rule, if we could get rid of the self-inflicted embarrassment, the scourge of apathy and disconnect, if we could just get those that are in the asset column in this great country to vote.
[00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:29.848]  We would send the Liberals and the Democrats packing, because there are no blue states.
[00:23:30.348 --> 00:23:50.818]  There are red-blooded, red states all across the nation, but if you look at California, you've got some high-crime, gun-free zones, sanctuary city, bankrupt, Liberal-Democrat hellholes, where you have to dodge needles and feces to get to work in the morning.
[00:23:51.915 --> 00:23:53.936]  San Francisco is not California.
[00:23:53.956 --> 00:23:55.737]  Detroit is not Michigan.
[00:23:56.077 --> 00:23:57.979]  Chicago is not Illinois.
[00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:00.440]  Boston is not Massachusetts.
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:12.026]  But a lot of people in those otherwise known as blue states, they shrug their shoulders and they think they're overwhelmed by the blue curse in those states, and they don't vote.
[00:24:12.347 --> 00:24:16.489]  Alex, everybody listening right now to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:17.607 --> 00:24:22.825]  You know that we have to vote Republican, and I know Republicans have not been our friends often.
[00:24:23.553 --> 00:24:51.898]  But if we hold these Republican elected employees' feet to the constitutional fire, and we reach out today in preparation for the vote tomorrow, and get our family and friends and co-workers and hunting buddies and guys at the gun range and the barbecue and the bowling alley, we the people in the asset column that do perform our American responsibility to vote, we need to prod, cajole, inspire,
[00:24:52.598 --> 00:24:52.838]  Alex!
[00:25:17.088 --> 00:25:19.890]  This is sheer insanity.
[00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.151]  That's how they're capturing us, as Matt Dredge pointed out in a tweet he put out.
[00:25:23.572 --> 00:25:37.559]  Mainstream news, even Politico had headlines, oh look, they're not citizens but they're still getting the vote out, volunteering to canvas, volunteering to make phone calls, and it was illegal aliens actually involved in election meddling.
[00:25:37.599 --> 00:25:39.380]  That's mainstream news in our face.
[00:25:39.661 --> 00:25:43.062]  They have illegal aliens voting in San Francisco in local elections.
[00:25:43.202 --> 00:25:44.643]  So let me expand on this in our time.
[00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:45.564]  I'm not going to waste
[00:25:46.024 --> 00:25:46.966]  Time playing the clip.
[00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:47.647]  I'm sure you saw it.
[00:25:47.667 --> 00:25:48.769]  It's been big national news.
[00:25:49.329 --> 00:25:57.783]  Michael Moore's been making the rounds on late night TV saying, uh, working class white people like, like me from Michigan are stupid.
[00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:04.253]  We're dumb, and we're the problem, and we need to just die out, as if white people are inherently bad.
[00:26:05.153 --> 00:26:15.839]  So because white people are associated with capitalism and free market and hard work, I guess in his mind, he says we're inherently bad, and then throws Michigan particularly under the bus.
[00:26:16.519 --> 00:26:32.372]  Which is so horrible, all the white people, black people, you name it, when he first made his name standing up against deindustrialization and our jobs being shipped overseas, we finally get a president that proves he can bring them back and who loves everybody, and this guy race baits and craps all over everyone.
[00:26:32.632 --> 00:26:33.773]  He is just a monster!
[00:26:35.004 --> 00:26:52.846]  Well, we have glowing and glaring and painful examples like Michael Moore, but here in the state of Michigan, and again, I'm a Texan, I'm a proud Texan, and the battle between a great constitutionalist, a great dedicated employee of people like Ted Cruz, and this Beto O'Rourke
[00:26:53.366 --> 00:27:01.810]  Beto, or whatever it is, Beto O'Rourke that wants to turn Texas into California, and up here in Michigan, Michael Moore doesn't represent real Michigan.
[00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:07.993]  I've been campaigning with a great young black man from Detroit, this African-American, John James.
[00:27:08.474 --> 00:27:10.695]  I'd like Michael Moore to meet John James.
[00:27:10.715 --> 00:27:13.056]  This is a hero of the United States military.
[00:27:13.516 --> 00:27:15.277]  John James is running for U.S.
[00:27:15.337 --> 00:27:18.299]  Senate here in Michigan, and he is my blood brother.
[00:27:18.579 --> 00:27:20.720]  He represents working-hard America.
[00:27:22.071 --> 00:27:45.103]  In the asset column, without any color, without any race considerations at all, do you put your heart and soul into being a productive American like John James, or are you an America-hating propagandist, racist, who identifies an entire color of race as bad guys like Michael Moore?
[00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:48.725]  I'm going to tell you, everybody I know, Alex, is
[00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:51.127]  I totally agree, by the way.
[00:28:04.022 --> 00:28:07.826]  All his movies fail, even the New York Times says everyone's sick of him.
[00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:12.531]  Michael Moore is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, but then he says free market's bad.
[00:28:12.551 --> 00:28:17.195]  He's a lying pig like the rest of the American-hating Democrats that don't want us to have jobs.
[00:28:17.435 --> 00:28:18.477]  They want to break our will.
[00:28:18.537 --> 00:28:20.459]  They want to totally take control of us.
[00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:24.643]  Every city, every area they take control of is a nightmare hellhole.
[00:28:25.243 --> 00:28:30.906]  Well, if I can just summarize it here in the state of Michigan, we're voting on whether to legalize recreational marijuana.
[00:28:31.266 --> 00:28:39.150]  And if you want more people to look and stink and sound like Michael Moore, then by all means, vote yes for recreational marijuana.
[00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:44.833]  Because this guy is the poster child for a brain-dead, America-hating punk.
[00:28:45.453 --> 00:28:46.695]  Well, you're on fire.
[00:28:46.755 --> 00:28:47.657]  TedNuja.com.
[00:28:47.677 --> 00:28:49.019]  The new album's about to come out.
[00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:49.820]  The music made me do it.
[00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:52.324]  I hope I'm talking to you in a couple days, my friend.
[00:28:52.565 --> 00:28:53.767]  And we've got a big figure.
[00:28:53.787 --> 00:28:56.190]  But regardless, America's awake again and rising.
[00:28:56.231 --> 00:28:56.771]  God bless you.
[00:28:57.753 --> 00:28:58.094]  Speed.
[00:28:58.114 --> 00:28:59.215]  God bless America, Alex.
[00:29:04.191 --> 00:29:05.992]  I'm a government auditor, right?
[00:29:06.032 --> 00:29:07.733]  So I work for the Government Accountability Office.
[00:29:08.153 --> 00:29:13.737]  That is Natalijan Subramanian, an auditor for the Government Accountability Office.
[00:29:14.337 --> 00:29:23.723]  The GAO, as it's called, is supposed to be an independent, non-partisan agency that investigates how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars.
[00:29:24.183 --> 00:29:32.408]  Subramanian is also an avowed communist and a committed member of DSA, the Democratic Socialists of America.
[00:29:32.988 --> 00:29:40.517]  Subramanian admits that he is not alone, that there are many, many DSA socialist operatives
[00:29:48.146 --> 00:29:50.227]  Working inside our federal government.
[00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:53.408]  These people, these socialists, are not helping our government.
[00:29:53.528 --> 00:29:56.790]  They are actively subverting President Trump's policies.
[00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:12.237]  Like, if you're an executive branch agency, um, you can slow all things to a degree that it's, like, ineffective, and maybe you get in trouble, and maybe, you know, you get fired, or you resign, or whatever, but, like, you slow them down for a certain period of time.
[00:30:12.637 --> 00:30:16.639]  Perfect timing with Trump battling the deep state and rogue government.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.461]  Literally saying they're taking their orders from Hillary and Obama.
[00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:21.422]  They call her Madam President still.
[00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:26.005]  Just the arrogance, the attitude, the videos you have of them saying, we're never going to get fired.
[00:30:26.065 --> 00:30:28.006]  We're part of the Socialist and Communist Party.
[00:30:28.066 --> 00:30:29.427]  We're going to take over America.
[00:30:29.607 --> 00:30:31.328]  And so it's the arrogance.
[00:30:31.928 --> 00:30:33.089]  It's the chicken neckness.
[00:30:33.249 --> 00:30:34.670]  It's the stupidness of them.
[00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.151]  But then it makes me feel stupid.
[00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:39.553]  How do we ever let this much scum run our lives, James O'Keefe?
[00:30:39.693 --> 00:30:55.477]  Well, Alex, you know, this is why maybe we need civil service reform, because the Deep State is not just the director of the intelligence agency and Rosenstein and whoever else, it's also millions of foot soldiers, thousands and thousands of these people that we've caught on tape.
[00:30:55.918 --> 00:30:57.878]  This is just a small cross-sampling of them.
[00:30:58.438 --> 00:31:08.221]  And yes, if you look at these tapes, what's remarkable is, I mean, the guy that we released Thursday, this self-described communist inside a government auditor's office,
[00:31:08.821 --> 00:31:28.526]  He says, what I do is explicitly prohibited, I'm hungover, I don't even go to work, I spend my time, this is what he says on the tape, I spend my time electing democratic socialists and I lied on my forms to the federal government, but nothing will ever happen to me because there's no oversight, nobody will care, it's impossible to get fired.
[00:31:28.906 --> 00:31:32.628]  There he is right there, Nate Subramanian, Auditor at GAO.
[00:31:33.068 --> 00:31:36.510]  So it's just, these are what they call the Democratic Socialists of America.
[00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.190]  A lot of them are federal employees.
[00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.851]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:41.292]  This is videotape.
[00:31:41.412 --> 00:31:47.755]  And by the way, the man you're looking at right there, that man right there, he has been shown the door at GAO.
[00:31:48.155 --> 00:31:53.044]  While they can't, may not be able to, quote, fire him, they have removed him from the building.
[00:31:53.064 --> 00:31:54.787]  This is like a Greek tragedy.
[00:31:54.827 --> 00:31:59.294]  They can't fire the people, so they just have to, like, take them away from their computer systems.
[00:32:01.553 --> 00:32:04.998]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:05.518 --> 00:32:08.262]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:08.803 --> 00:32:14.611]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:17.855]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:18.576 --> 00:32:22.018]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:28.461]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:28.861 --> 00:32:33.824]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:34.574 --> 00:32:37.996]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:38.496 --> 00:32:45.040]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:50.382]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:50.863 --> 00:32:56.025]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:56.606 --> 00:33:00.588]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.771]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.054 --> 00:33:18.255]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:18.775 --> 00:33:23.997]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.500]  Two choices.
[00:33:36.792 --> 00:33:40.837]  We are in an economic boom that most folks thought was impossible.
[00:33:40.897 --> 00:33:45.724]  We have penetrated the 1-2% so-called secular stagnation zone.
[00:33:45.844 --> 00:33:52.493]  Average hourly earnings up by 2.8% near record levels of consumer air business confidence.
[00:33:52.933 --> 00:33:56.054]  The second quarter GDP growth is impressive.
[00:33:56.074 --> 00:34:00.935]  4.1%, the lowest unemployment rate since December of 1969.
[00:34:00.995 --> 00:34:03.876]  The American core economy is on fire.
[00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:08.097]  It's on fire like it was in the 60s.
[00:34:08.137 --> 00:34:11.018]  Can you bring him down?
[00:34:11.358 --> 00:34:13.619]  For the less American.
[00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:19.660]  As you tell them, they're not welcome!
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.481]  We're live on Facebook.
[00:34:21.521 --> 00:34:21.841]  Make a loan.
[00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:45.616]  That's when civility can start again.
[00:35:09.608 --> 00:35:14.832]  And now they've got illegal aliens in mainstream news with the headlines like it's a good thing.
[00:35:15.212 --> 00:35:16.373]  They're not citizens.
[00:35:17.534 --> 00:35:18.915]  Many of them aren't even here legally.
[00:35:19.295 --> 00:35:23.919]  They can't vote, but they can canvas and make phone calls and donate money.
[00:35:24.219 --> 00:35:24.780]  No, you can't.
[00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:29.643]  But the Democrats yell and scream about election meddling, and they're the ones that have been doing it.
[00:35:30.944 --> 00:35:36.629]  Now, I could spend all day here with the technicals of why I think the Republicans hold on to the House and the Senate.
[00:35:37.756 --> 00:35:39.597]  There's a lot of information that goes into that.
[00:35:40.797 --> 00:35:47.820]  But I have trouble tracking the level of fraud, the level of illegal spending, the level of censorship.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.381]  All I know is it's ultra-massive.
[00:35:52.242 --> 00:35:58.764]  And it's political oppression the likes of which this country has never seen on this scale.
[00:36:02.565 --> 00:36:06.327]  And so I don't know if we're going to win tomorrow or not.
[00:36:07.245 --> 00:36:18.029]  I knew we were going to win two years ago because they were oversampling on some CNN polls 36% extra against Trump.
[00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:25.471]  And they have Hillary at 75% winning and I'd do the math and explain that's really her losing.
[00:36:28.635 --> 00:36:38.603]  This time, the Democrats are five points ahead in most of these phony polls, and in some polls, the Republicans are ahead a point or two.
[00:36:38.864 --> 00:36:42.867]  Like Rasmussen today, it's on Infowars.com, Paul Watson article, it's a big deal.
[00:36:45.189 --> 00:36:52.094]  And I go look at the methodology, they're running the same scams they ran two years ago.
[00:36:52.215 --> 00:36:54.817]  So, are they just counting on electronic voting machine fraud?
[00:36:54.857 --> 00:36:57.299]  We know Soros owns, has a share in.
[00:36:59.344 --> 00:37:00.325]  More than half the companies?
[00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:02.826]  I don't know.
[00:37:02.846 --> 00:37:09.190]  Remember the New York Times had her on their front page for months at 98 percent, 97 percent.
[00:37:09.651 --> 00:37:12.613]  About a week before, 60 percent, you know, 80 percent.
[00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:13.313]  It went back and forth.
[00:37:14.414 --> 00:37:16.975]  Because they began to figure out their bull wasn't working.
[00:37:17.176 --> 00:37:20.017]  All I'm telling you is, I've never seen so much activity.
[00:37:20.398 --> 00:37:21.899]  I've never seen so much bullying.
[00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:23.700]  I've never seen so much censorship.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.681]  I've never seen so much foaming at the mouth.
[00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:26.742]  So I don't know.
[00:37:29.002 --> 00:37:32.284]  But I want to be clear about something.
[00:37:32.304 --> 00:37:34.385]  I want to be totally crystal clear about something.
[00:37:35.226 --> 00:37:36.687]  There are two different roads here.
[00:37:39.509 --> 00:37:41.230]  And I'm going to talk about this in the next segment.
[00:37:43.011 --> 00:37:47.514]  But what I'm going to tell you on air is the reason they want me off air.
[00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:55.159]  Because InfoWars is visionary, I do my homework, and I know what I'm talking about.
[00:37:56.488 --> 00:38:00.510]  And we could lose the country if we win this election.
[00:38:01.251 --> 00:38:08.896]  It hit me yesterday because I've been thinking and focusing and frustrated trying to come up with what the answer is I was looking for.
[00:38:09.516 --> 00:38:10.597]  Why I was frustrated?
[00:38:10.617 --> 00:38:22.704]  Because my subconscious is hundreds of times more powerful than my conscience and it was not happy and as soon as this came into vision and I researched it at a cognitive level, I knew I was right.
[00:38:26.121 --> 00:38:28.643]  Because election numbers are surging on both sides.
[00:38:28.703 --> 00:38:30.124]  Turnout is surging on both sides.
[00:38:30.164 --> 00:38:31.705]  But what's really important here?
[00:38:34.867 --> 00:38:41.171]  If we win this midterm and people go to sleep, we could lose the election in two years.
[00:38:45.294 --> 00:38:48.296]  And if the Republicans don't go after the Democrats for the
[00:38:49.471 --> 00:39:13.257]  Soviet level censorship of conservatives and Christians and the deplatforming and taking the bank accounts and all the rest of it, then it will cement that and they will get worse and so we will have an occupied government and a tyranny and a divided nation with Trump trying to fix the economy and put out fires while the emboldened Democrats ratchet up their crime.
[00:39:14.658 --> 00:39:18.959]  So I want to win tomorrow.
[00:39:21.169 --> 00:39:31.995]  But I want people to stay awake and realize that's only the next level of our invasion of the United States, our take back of the Republic from the globalists and the reinforcements they're trying to pour in.
[00:39:33.796 --> 00:39:35.718]  This is 21st century warfare, folks.
[00:39:35.758 --> 00:39:38.499]  This is real toe-to-toe battle with the globalists.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.682]  Outside powerful combines trying to destabilize and overthrow the nation.
[00:39:43.742 --> 00:39:45.363]  This is very serious business.
[00:39:47.264 --> 00:39:49.706]  So if we beat the Democrats, we shouldn't be celebrating.
[00:39:51.527 --> 00:39:57.051]  We should be realizing we just won one more big battle and God's on our side, but it's about to get even tougher.
[00:39:58.112 --> 00:40:06.138]  And if we lose, it's going to get even tougher, but maybe we'll know we're getting our asses kicked again and we'll do something about it.
[00:40:07.298 --> 00:40:12.802]  Now, I haven't aired this since election day, a year and 364 days ago, but I'm going to air
[00:40:19.585 --> 00:40:33.111]  The entire 15 minute compilation that our great Rob Dew put together, our news director, of my predictions on election night and what I said once Trump was officially admitted to have won.
[00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:39.514]  And Hillary wouldn't show up and concede and we told you she was having an alcoholic flip out and eating the carpet, which was later confirmed.
[00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:40.774]  See, we have good sources.
[00:40:45.656 --> 00:40:48.058]  Secret Service doesn't tell me anything now because there's no need to.
[00:40:48.118 --> 00:40:48.758]  Trump's not a traitor.
[00:40:50.689 --> 00:40:52.870]  Sure, if he becomes one, they'll tell me, which is not going to happen.
[00:40:53.891 --> 00:40:56.112]  Don't ever hold your breath for that to happen.
[00:40:56.872 --> 00:40:59.433]  Trump is so pig-headed, it's the best thing ever for this country.
[00:40:59.674 --> 00:41:01.174]  He's the perfect person for this.
[00:41:01.194 --> 00:41:04.756]  And let me tell you something, it isn't about groveling at Trump's feet or being sycophantic.
[00:41:05.016 --> 00:41:11.259]  It's about thanking God we've got somebody that's willing to stand up against the lies, the tyranny, the oppression, and turn things around.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.601]  But there's a path to victory if we lose tomorrow.
[00:41:16.342 --> 00:41:18.403]  There's a path to victory if we win tomorrow.
[00:41:19.346 --> 00:41:24.730]  There's a path to fail if we win tomorrow, and there is a path to fail if we lose tomorrow.
[00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:32.014]  And that's what we better be thinking about, is grand strategy, grand aim, what our goal is, where we're going, not just this battle.
[00:41:33.015 --> 00:41:34.276]  Grand strategy is key.
[00:41:34.556 --> 00:41:39.139]  They always want to keep you down in the mud, looking at the latest little problem.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.260]  Those are important.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.341]  Look at them, take care of them.
[00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:43.082]  But look at where they're coming from.
[00:41:43.322 --> 00:41:44.563]  Look at who the enemy is.
[00:41:44.803 --> 00:41:46.004]  Look at how the enemy ticks.
[00:41:46.424 --> 00:41:47.505]  Look at how we're going to defeat them.
[00:41:49.139 --> 00:42:02.807]  And the best way to defeat them is to point out that they're a bunch of offshore mega-globalists, tax-exempt, above the law, who've committed more crimes than anybody can ever imagine, who are totally ruthless, and everyone is insane if we put up with it.
[00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:09.071]  Now, we had one of the biggest sales, if not biggest sales in our history, because they're trying to take our payment processors and shut us down.
[00:42:09.091 --> 00:42:10.452]  They haven't been able to do that yet.
[00:42:10.492 --> 00:42:11.433]  They took five of the six.
[00:42:12.455 --> 00:42:16.496]  I got a backup, but we're still, you know, redlining here.
[00:42:16.996 --> 00:42:29.838]  And so I need to sell out a lot of the products that we had that had been developed and packaged and prepared for the Christmas sale, the Black Friday sale and more.
[00:42:30.478 --> 00:42:31.778]  It was a very successful sale.
[00:42:31.818 --> 00:42:34.699]  We sold out a lot of things or came very, very close to it.
[00:42:34.999 --> 00:42:40.960]  But the items we do have, I'm now going to offer an even bigger discount, but it's only going to run through
[00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:50.560]  Next week, and ladies and gentlemen, that's the InfoWars 67% off blowout sale.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.001]  Most of these are lost leaders.
[00:42:52.301 --> 00:43:07.585]  Silver Bullet, Super Mel Vitality, Brain Force, Survival Shield X3, Alexa Pure Water Filtration Systems, they all are between 67... An energized quantum state.
[00:43:09.005 --> 00:43:11.406]  Or an energized atomic state.
[00:43:12.239 --> 00:43:12.880]  What does that mean?
[00:43:13.961 --> 00:43:15.302]  It means it's pure.
[00:43:16.283 --> 00:43:23.430]  And it means the properties of what it does in the body in interaction with other properties is pure.
[00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:25.892]  It's unadulterated.
[00:43:25.912 --> 00:43:26.492]  It's original.
[00:43:26.733 --> 00:43:27.874]  It's first generation.
[00:43:29.469 --> 00:43:40.538]  This has been quite a quest for Infowars when we discovered that there's a whole UN world government plan to remove even crappy forms of iodine out of food so that people can't absorb it.
[00:43:40.598 --> 00:43:46.283]  When I say crappy forms, I mean types that are bound to other elements so your body doesn't get absorption.
[00:43:47.103 --> 00:43:52.788]  This is an essential element in the body, just like vitamin C, just like oxygen, just like water.
[00:43:53.951 --> 00:44:07.561]  At first, doing research, we got the best seaweed base, but it was still weak, and we had issues with supply, and then leftists found out six years ago that we were involved, that it was Infowars, so they cut us off.
[00:44:08.322 --> 00:44:16.348]  And then we came into X2 that was from oil and gas drilling at about 7,000 to 12,000 feet, getting pure crystals for truly pure iodine.
[00:44:16.368 --> 00:44:19.210]  We had to go through the DEA to get it, all these controls.
[00:44:20.247 --> 00:44:24.858]  Then the oil companies caught on that we were getting it, and they tried to jack up prices and cause us problems.
[00:44:24.898 --> 00:44:28.247]  And I didn't want to raise prices, so I cut my contract off with them.
[00:44:29.273 --> 00:44:36.778]  And we went out and did a huge industry research and found out we could get the same deep earth crystals, probably even purer.
[00:44:36.818 --> 00:44:39.280]  You're talking about like 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, you know, percent pure.
[00:44:40.641 --> 00:44:47.826]  And then the chemists and others explained to us that you need other types of basic iodine to make sure it gets fully absorbed.
[00:44:47.866 --> 00:44:50.108]  So this has all three types of iodine.
[00:44:51.525 --> 00:45:01.052]  And then it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that doesn't let it oxidize and basically keeps it in its energetic state, or its quantum state, its atomic state.
[00:45:01.273 --> 00:45:07.837]  And again, atomic doesn't mean radioactive, that just means it's pure on the periodic table.
[00:45:07.897 --> 00:45:08.698]  This is X3.
[00:45:09.299 --> 00:45:10.580]  I am so excited about X3.
[00:45:12.827 --> 00:45:17.989]  Out of the gate, we're bringing it to you at 50% off in the 1 oz and 2 oz bottles.
[00:45:18.609 --> 00:45:20.150]  Now we didn't have X2 in a 2 oz bottle.
[00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.690]  We do for X3 so you can stock up on it.
[00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:27.012]  It really is beyond game changing.
[00:45:27.092 --> 00:45:30.313]  It's essential.
[00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:36.495]  Survival Shield X3, nascent tri-iodine in 2 oz and in 1 oz bottles.
[00:45:37.035 --> 00:45:41.677]  Now you don't just get a key element that's essential to human life on this planet.
[00:45:42.995 --> 00:45:47.518]  You also fund an operation that's promoting the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the whole nine yards.
[00:45:47.818 --> 00:46:00.868]  I mean, quite frankly, I've got all these scientific documents and all these notes from chemists and all these facts, but I'm just going to tell the viewers, just like our information has changed the world, just like it pisses the establishment off, anything I'm going to bring you is the very best.
[00:46:01.508 --> 00:46:02.649]  It's like any of our products.
[00:46:02.669 --> 00:46:04.410]  I'm like, what is the top product?
[00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.491]  What is the best tested?
[00:46:05.771 --> 00:46:07.072]  What is absolutely highest rated?
[00:46:07.593 --> 00:46:11.636]  I want to put a formula out stronger and better and lower the price.
[00:46:12.356 --> 00:46:13.436]  We're always innovating.
[00:46:13.476 --> 00:46:14.477]  We're always researching.
[00:46:15.117 --> 00:46:25.420]  But quite frankly, it's been oppression and it's the people trying to block our supply chain that made us go out and really do the hard work to discover what is the very best documented form of iodine.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:31.722]  And it's all three types fused together, energized by a small amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it.
[00:46:32.802 --> 00:46:36.143]  Three forms of iodine is better than one.
[00:46:37.111 --> 00:46:39.313]  And so, that's why X3 is so amazing.
[00:46:39.813 --> 00:46:46.980]  That's why all the results we've got and the trials we have with the crew and others are so breathtakingly cool.
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:53.185]  If you liked X2, you're gonna love X3 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:53.525 --> 00:46:54.106]  The next level.
[00:47:05.372 --> 00:47:07.963]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.935 --> 00:47:31.397]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:47:31.777 --> 00:47:34.879]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:35.979 --> 00:47:40.021]  In less than 20 hours, polls will begin opening on the East Coast.
[00:47:40.902 --> 00:47:45.744]  In about 20 hours, they'll open in the middle of the country, Central Time.
[00:47:46.304 --> 00:47:47.945]  Then Mountain, then Pacific.
[00:47:49.126 --> 00:47:49.546]  And by...
[00:47:51.667 --> 00:47:56.410]  Midnight tomorrow night, we'll have a very good chance about who's holding the House and Senate.
[00:47:57.110 --> 00:48:04.415]  Except some of these races are so close, there's a couple of run-offs coming up in a few months that may actually decide it.
[00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:12.020]  This is going to be hard fought, and that's my big message that I'm going to be launching with Roger Stone in studio next hour.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:18.804]  Is even if we win, it was by overcoming massive fraud, and we must
[00:48:20.126 --> 00:48:21.267]  Demand recounts.
[00:48:21.387 --> 00:48:32.456]  We must demand investigations of election meddling by Beto O'Rourke and all the Soros money he got and the foreign money he got and aiding the caravan.
[00:48:33.537 --> 00:48:44.706]  And we must expose the big tech censorship that by blocking Republicans and others being able to advertise on Facebook but letting Democrats advertise is a total Federal Elections Commission violation.
[00:48:46.345 --> 00:49:02.977]  And thank God we've got Trump, because they're signaling in the news today, and this is coming up as well, antitrust investigations, that is in CNBC, against Big Tech, Amazon, and others, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:03.817 --> 00:49:06.599]  So this is one hell of a fight we're in.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.561]  It's our moral duty, it's our responsibility.
[00:49:10.461 --> 00:49:18.466]  To have hearings about election meddling by the Chi-Coms, funding Hollywood, funding four-page ads, full-page ads, radio ads, TV ads.
[00:49:18.926 --> 00:49:20.527]  They're doing it publicly!
[00:49:21.888 --> 00:49:22.988]  We have them!
[00:49:24.389 --> 00:49:26.891]  They've gone so far, it's just incredible.
[00:49:27.571 --> 00:49:32.214]  And then, next hour with Roger Stone, I'm going to talk about
[00:49:33.342 --> 00:49:40.125]  Some of these other articles I have, dim candidate Georgians might have to turn their guns in, close quote.
[00:49:40.786 --> 00:49:45.808]  That's a Kent Daniels, newswars.com, infowars.com article.
[00:49:47.649 --> 00:50:00.155]  Also, even mainstream media is now reporting that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of quote, former CIA people all ran in the midterms against Republicans.
[00:50:01.189 --> 00:50:08.635]  That they all had in state and federal elections bizarre homeland security support and bizarre foundation support.
[00:50:09.015 --> 00:50:21.484]  Because the country is in a civil war against loyal Americans and globalist collaborators who are actively working to destroy this country and capture it.
[00:50:22.385 --> 00:50:23.446]  They see us as weak.
[00:50:24.026 --> 00:50:25.467]  They see themselves as a cartel.
[00:50:26.562 --> 00:50:37.992]  And they have made the decision to end free market, to end America, to end the Republic, and to basically become the new political party, the inner party, like they have in Communist China.
[00:50:38.512 --> 00:50:46.879]  Not of the Democrats, but of the deep state, of the bureaucracy, and set up a permanent bureaucratic dictatorship in this country.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.702]  Of course, you all know it as the swamp.
[00:50:51.559 --> 00:50:54.623]  Mike Adams has written an extremely critical article that must go viral.
[00:50:55.064 --> 00:51:04.596]  I'm not sure the headline is strong enough, but win or lose, it's time for America to push back against the incivility, lawlessness, and fraud of the political left.
[00:51:04.897 --> 00:51:05.758]  Very strong headline.
[00:51:06.869 --> 00:51:12.592]  But really what we're talking about is, win or lose, Democrats aren't Americans.
[00:51:13.273 --> 00:51:21.957]  Democrats are an anti-American party working with foreign multinational interests and must be met head-on and smoked out of their holes politically.
[00:51:22.718 --> 00:51:33.504]  They've got to be sued, they've got to be indicted, they've got to be, and believe me, you know, I know who gave us the shutdown of our banking and our
[00:51:35.918 --> 00:51:38.601]  And the lawyers have looked at it.
[00:51:38.761 --> 00:51:50.031]  It's open and shut criminal activity by a large financial institution that controls not the credit score for the average person, but a secret credit scoring for companies.
[00:51:50.552 --> 00:51:52.914]  And we had perfect score.
[00:51:53.294 --> 00:51:54.516]  No one, almost no one has it.
[00:51:54.776 --> 00:51:55.136]  We had a 99.999.
[00:51:55.376 --> 00:51:59.560]  I'm going to be announcing this soon and I'm going to sue them.
[00:52:00.181 --> 00:52:01.222]  So I'm just giving them a heads up.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:11.890]  And they decided to put in there the designation of hate, something that wasn't even in their system before, and then that gives us a zero.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:13.440]  That's right.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:26.927]  Infowars has zero credit because a criminal group in the deep state associated with intelligence agencies treated me like a foreign government and put sanctions on us saying, do not do business with us.
[00:52:27.347 --> 00:52:30.089]  I think the president's going to be very interested in this.
[00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:32.750]  Congress is going to be very interested in this.
[00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:36.572]  And you're going to pay.
[00:52:36.592 --> 00:52:37.993]  You're going to pay.
[00:52:39.213 --> 00:52:40.154]  Oh, I forgot the best part.
[00:52:42.315 --> 00:52:44.537]  We have moles inside these groups, that's why we know this.
[00:52:45.718 --> 00:52:56.308]  They're really freaked out because they're saying, oh yes, next we're going to roll it out against the NRA, and against conservatives in general, and against Christians, and against anybody who's pro-America.
[00:52:56.728 --> 00:52:59.010]  You won't be able to get a bank account.
[00:52:59.811 --> 00:53:00.672]  And they're going to do it!
[00:53:01.412 --> 00:53:06.076]  They think they're just going to roll this out and literally put you on the street.
[00:53:07.418 --> 00:53:08.559]  That's called dictatorship.
[00:53:09.557 --> 00:53:16.419]  And all because they define you as hate, they put it into this system that only the banks and financial systems see.
[00:53:16.439 --> 00:53:34.162]  I'll be announcing it all soon, but we have to have documentaries and films, we have to have ads, we have to have lawsuits with it showing it all, because we have to really get this all ready for Congress and the President and everybody to take strong, decisive action, because this is seriously criminal.
[00:53:35.263 --> 00:53:36.243]  Seriously criminal.
[00:53:37.264 --> 00:53:44.366]  Now there's been some big judgments for companies and groups that claim that companies and things don't have value that they don't, just to be mean.
[00:53:44.426 --> 00:53:47.687]  That's called espionage.
[00:53:48.607 --> 00:53:51.888]  And so, this is so wide-reaching.
[00:53:51.948 --> 00:53:55.789]  It's the Chinese social score in one fell swoop.
[00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:04.572]  In one fell swoop, they intend to cut off conservatives, Christians, libertarians, veterans, you name it.
[00:54:06.087 --> 00:54:12.312]  And they've even got a plan to then drive you into the hands of another group, but then they're gonna rip you off and charge you extra money.
[00:54:12.532 --> 00:54:18.437]  So they've got a whole plan ready, and the whole plan's gonna come down, and I expect people will probably go to jail after this.
[00:54:19.478 --> 00:54:27.984]  But again, these criminals have been getting along, you know, getting away with this for so long, they think that they are invincible.
[00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:32.268]  They think that they are unstoppable.
[00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:35.491]  They think that they're God.
[00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:41.973]  They think they're going to go on forever, and ever, and ever.
[00:54:43.093 --> 00:54:45.674]  And that is just not the case, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:47.134 --> 00:54:49.115]  So, this is what criminals always do.
[00:54:49.175 --> 00:54:58.497]  They push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they get away with it, and they get away with it, and they get away with it, and they get away with it, and finally,
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:06.401]  They can't believe that the people turn against them and don't care what they say or don't care what they do or don't care how much intimidation there is.
[00:55:06.481 --> 00:55:07.662]  They stand against them.
[00:55:09.022 --> 00:55:15.364]  So coming up, I'm going to play about 10 minutes or so of election night two years ago, where I said, get ready for the big assault.
[00:55:15.864 --> 00:55:16.824]  Get ready for lawlessness.
[00:55:16.884 --> 00:55:21.045]  And Roger Stone is going to be joining us in studio.
[00:55:21.065 --> 00:55:22.625]  And we've got a bunch of other big guests.
[00:55:22.645 --> 00:55:25.166]  We're going to be broadcasting until midnight tonight.
[00:55:26.817 --> 00:55:28.679]  And then tomorrow with David Knight at 8 a.m.
[00:55:28.719 --> 00:55:42.295]  we kick off with live InfoWars coverage of the midterm elections and then we go right through Tuesday into the early morning hours as late as we have to go into Wednesday.
[00:55:43.303 --> 00:55:45.025]  And, you know, we always do this for other elections.
[00:55:45.045 --> 00:55:46.786]  This one's so important I overlooked it.
[00:55:47.367 --> 00:55:49.849]  But I guess today we'll just make an election page.
[00:55:49.869 --> 00:55:52.691]  We already have InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:55:53.292 --> 00:55:58.076]  We already have the daily article we put out at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:55:58.416 --> 00:56:03.420]  And we can pull that up that, you know, says one day left to countdown to historic election.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.163]  And that's got the live audio and live video feeds in it.
[00:56:06.223 --> 00:56:09.366]  But regardless, just let your friends, your neighbors, your family,
[00:56:09.986 --> 00:56:22.270]  Your community know that they can go to Infowars.com and get the censored coverage of what's really going on and then find out about fighting back against all of this.
[00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:29.792]  Regardless of whether we win or lose, we've got to go after them for what they've done.
[00:56:34.293 --> 00:56:39.455]  So now, because I didn't do a very good plug last segment, before we start the next hour, I'm going to
[00:56:40.592 --> 00:56:41.573]  I'm going to do it now.
[00:56:42.613 --> 00:56:48.557]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the biggest sale in our history on limited items.
[00:56:48.637 --> 00:56:53.280]  It does not top the biggest sale we've ever engaged in, period.
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:57.682]  And I've lost my piece of paper because I'm just losing everything here, let me tell you.
[00:56:58.963 --> 00:57:01.064]  But there it is at Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:03.766]  67% out total blowout sale.
[00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:10.688]  On the highest quality colloidal silver out there.
[00:57:11.752 --> 00:57:14.513]  This is all for $29 at Whole Foods with another label on it.
[00:57:14.533 --> 00:57:15.754]  We normally sell for $19.95.
[00:57:16.454 --> 00:57:18.355]  It's 67% off right now.
[00:57:18.895 --> 00:57:21.657]  We also have Super Metal and Super Female Vitality, the final run of that.
[00:57:22.217 --> 00:57:27.580]  Even though it would take me a long time to sell out of it, we've got it at 57% off because I just want to move it out.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:33.883]  50% off on RainForce Plus, a big discount on Alexa Pure, water filtration, and so much more.
[00:57:33.903 --> 00:57:38.345]  And your purchases all make the broadcast and what we do here possible.
[00:57:39.185 --> 00:57:45.369]  So again, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:47.031]  Next hour, only two minutes away.
[00:57:52.174 --> 00:57:52.695]  Look at that.
[00:57:52.715 --> 00:57:55.437]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[00:57:55.477 --> 00:57:57.758]  That's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[00:57:57.798 --> 00:57:58.779]  We didn't do that.
[00:58:00.461 --> 00:58:04.562]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[00:58:04.982 --> 00:58:06.643]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[00:58:07.223 --> 00:58:15.765]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[00:58:16.245 --> 00:58:17.925]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[00:58:17.986 --> 00:58:19.086]  Don't you get the big secret?
[00:58:19.766 --> 00:58:22.287]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[00:58:22.327 --> 00:58:23.427]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[00:58:24.207 --> 00:58:27.128]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[00:58:29.955 --> 00:58:31.296]  Liquid consciousness.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:35.040]  Look it up.
[00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:36.662]  Find out.
[00:58:38.704 --> 00:58:42.167]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[00:58:42.207 --> 00:58:47.072]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[00:58:47.533 --> 00:58:49.735]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products.
[00:58:49.795 --> 00:58:50.636]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:51.727 --> 00:58:57.449]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[00:58:57.749 --> 00:59:01.771]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[00:59:02.211 --> 00:59:04.412]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[00:59:04.432 --> 00:59:06.572]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[00:59:06.912 --> 00:59:08.913]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[00:59:09.433 --> 00:59:09.693]  Boom!
[00:59:09.974 --> 00:59:12.234]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[00:59:12.575 --> 00:59:14.135]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[00:59:14.195 --> 00:59:16.016]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[00:59:16.076 --> 00:59:17.196]  You still have a shopfront.
[00:59:17.376 --> 00:59:18.177]  And then what do we see?
[00:59:18.457 --> 00:59:19.197]  Washington Post.
[00:59:19.777 --> 00:59:22.898]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%!
[00:59:24.258 --> 00:59:27.379]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[00:59:27.399 --> 00:59:30.240]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:35.942]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:36.262 --> 00:59:43.244]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros, like Media Matters is, to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[00:59:43.584 --> 00:59:46.965]  We're not funded by Dolph State dictatorships, like CNN is,
[00:59:47.245 --> 00:59:50.752]  We're only funded by you, by getting the products at Infootballstore.com.
[01:00:27.694 --> 01:00:33.777]  Well, it's November 5th, 2000 at 18, and I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.817 --> 01:00:41.002]  We are less than 20 hours out from the polls opening tomorrow on the East Coast.
[01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.544]  We're going to have live coverage right through to the middle of the night.
[01:00:46.485 --> 01:00:55.670]  There's a good chance we won't know who the winners are until one or two in the morning, and it could even go longer than that because there are reports coming in
[01:00:58.575 --> 01:01:21.487]  We're going to be looking at here coming up that there are some runoff elections coming up that if the margin is basically a dead heat, then it may be a few months with these runoff elections coming until we find out exactly who the winner is going to be.
[01:01:21.527 --> 01:01:22.308]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:26.250]  We've come from nowhere.
[01:01:28.231 --> 01:01:29.951]  Exposing the entire globalist system.
[01:01:31.932 --> 01:01:44.614]  And people would talk about the New World Order 30 years ago, 20 years ago, and people looked at you like you were a space alien, as corporate media had preconditioned everybody that it didn't exist.
[01:01:45.615 --> 01:01:56.657]  But now that people understand that this is all real, and world government's real, and that it's unelected, you've got prominent people all over the planet saying, this is wrong.
[01:02:01.977 --> 01:02:06.879]  And so I know I keep going back to that same point.
[01:02:06.939 --> 01:02:09.239]  You know what I hate about this show is looking at myself.
[01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:10.200]  I can't do it anymore.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:11.660]  I'm gonna have to go off air.
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:13.501]  It's me.
[01:02:14.621 --> 01:02:15.861]  I cannot look at myself.
[01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:16.542]  I hate it.
[01:02:16.602 --> 01:02:17.522]  I'm not a narcissist.
[01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:23.784]  And it's just I used to love radio because I could sit there and really think and go over and get in my thought process.
[01:02:24.704 --> 01:02:28.405]  And I wonder why do I am so happy and then I get here and I'm so upset every day.
[01:02:28.985 --> 01:02:30.006]  I'm just so upset.
[01:02:30.936 --> 01:02:33.578]  That's because I'm just looking at myself and all these cameras.
[01:02:33.598 --> 01:02:47.005]  We've got to figure out a way to like just put articles up most of the time or video up of something else because I'm having to direct my own show and I'm looking at myself in here and it's just driving me wild in a bad way.
[01:02:48.246 --> 01:02:49.647]  And it's just not tenable.
[01:02:49.787 --> 01:02:51.368]  I'm going to have to change the way the show works.
[01:02:52.315 --> 01:02:56.616]  Because I don't like looking at myself before, but I really don't now, you know what I mean?
[01:02:57.156 --> 01:03:01.998]  And then I gotta look at Hillary, and I gotta look at Michael Moore while I'm in here, and they gotta be beaten.
[01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:03.258]  They've gotta be stopped.
[01:03:03.398 --> 01:03:06.959]  But, at the same time, whoo!
[01:03:07.199 --> 01:03:08.380]  Katie bar the door!
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.901]  Just, you know, Calgon, take me away, man!
[01:03:11.161 --> 01:03:11.941]  Good God!
[01:03:11.961 --> 01:03:15.642]  I mean, there's just so... Here it is.
[01:03:20.768 --> 01:03:23.450]  It's the frustration that this should all just be so easy.
[01:03:24.951 --> 01:03:27.413]  We shouldn't let unelected... Yeah, let's look at him for now.
[01:03:28.134 --> 01:03:38.742]  That we shouldn't let unelected megabanks run our lives and create all this division and control us.
[01:03:38.802 --> 01:03:48.630]  And then it's so obvious that they've created these universities, these America-hating institutions to breed and create these giant nests of total morons
[01:03:50.834 --> 01:03:59.762]  And then now, we've got a large portion of the population that's been turned into these spoiled, rotten, leftist authoritarians.
[01:04:00.964 --> 01:04:05.668]  And they believed Hillary was supposed to be when they took over and finally got all their free goodies.
[01:04:06.229 --> 01:04:07.109]  And that didn't happen.
[01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:09.672]  So they're now on a giant conniption fit.
[01:04:13.314 --> 01:04:16.456]  Trying to stop the recovery because they don't want a recovery.
[01:04:16.796 --> 01:04:28.701]  They want to control every aspect of our lives and run us in the ground so they can dictate societal controls on us because that's what these control freaks crave more than anything on the planet.
[01:04:30.002 --> 01:04:30.662]  I kind of liked it.
[01:04:30.702 --> 01:04:31.723]  That's the new host of the show.
[01:04:33.044 --> 01:04:34.484]  He doesn't mind cameras being on him.
[01:04:34.524 --> 01:04:35.405]  He doesn't see anything.
[01:04:36.245 --> 01:04:37.206]  That's the new system.
[01:04:39.046 --> 01:04:39.587]  I'm serious.
[01:04:40.563 --> 01:04:45.385]  Large portions of the show will now be a Spartan bronze figure.
[01:04:46.865 --> 01:04:47.226]  That's it.
[01:04:47.246 --> 01:04:48.346]  We're going back to radio.
[01:04:48.866 --> 01:04:51.627]  I launched all this to dominate YouTube and stuff, but my God.
[01:04:51.647 --> 01:04:54.688]  There's only so much of my ugly fat face I can look at.
[01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:57.770]  It's election day, ladies and gentlemen, in 20 hours.
[01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:58.250]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.915 --> 01:05:12.206]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:14.529]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:21.217]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:05:21.878 --> 01:05:27.701]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:05:28.161 --> 01:05:33.764]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:05:34.485 --> 01:05:41.448]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:55.155]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:05:55.655 --> 01:05:59.437]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:05:59.938 --> 01:06:02.719]  X3, now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:10.923]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:13.522 --> 01:06:17.645]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:25.051 --> 01:06:33.638]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:34.919 --> 01:06:41.685]  We're 20 hours out, and President Trump says as soon as the midterms are over, whether they retain the House and Senate or not,
[01:06:43.035 --> 01:06:46.543]  He's looking very strongly at antitrust action against Amazon and Big Tech.
[01:06:47.084 --> 01:06:48.868]  Here he is being interviewed by Axios.
[01:06:49.884 --> 01:06:51.885]  Talk about what's been happening on social media.
[01:06:51.905 --> 01:06:56.187]  A lot of people questioning whether or not these companies are getting too big, too fast.
[01:06:56.227 --> 01:06:57.507]  Your Facebooks, your Amazons.
[01:06:57.788 --> 01:07:02.970]  Have you put thought into how Amazon and Facebook specifically should be regulated?
[01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:09.113]  You look at the European Union, they find, I guess it was Google, billions of dollars.
[01:07:10.053 --> 01:07:13.875]  And frankly, I don't like that they're doing that, because that's an American company.
[01:07:13.895 --> 01:07:15.416]  I don't think it's good that they're doing that.
[01:07:15.756 --> 01:07:18.097]  But if anybody does that, that should be us doing it.
[01:07:18.797 --> 01:07:20.658]  That shouldn't be the European Union.
[01:07:20.678 --> 01:07:22.019]  Do you think he'll regulate in the first term?
[01:07:22.279 --> 01:07:27.741]  You know, you get into the whole thing with freedom of speech and what do you think and... But what about monopoly?
[01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:29.602]  What about saying the Justice Department look into... Well, you do.
[01:07:29.642 --> 01:07:35.305]  You know, I have so many people saying that, but it's certainly something that we have looked at... Would you ever break them up?
[01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:37.546]  They were talking about this years ago.
[01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:44.489]  You know, they were actually talking about this same subject, monopoly, years ago, long before I was in office.
[01:07:44.509 --> 01:07:45.549]  You think you were the man to do it?
[01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:50.932]  In fact, a lot of people thought it was going to happen, and then I guess a previous administration stopped it from happening.
[01:07:50.952 --> 01:07:51.752]  But you're in charge now?
[01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:52.933]  I am in charge.
[01:07:53.013 --> 01:07:55.574]  I am definitely in charge, and we are certainly looking at it.
[01:07:55.594 --> 01:07:56.414]  This is antitrust?
[01:07:57.275 --> 01:07:57.955]  Antitrust, yes.
[01:07:58.015 --> 01:07:58.195]  Right.
[01:07:58.495 --> 01:07:59.036]  For Amazon?
[01:07:59.716 --> 01:08:01.397]  For all three.
[01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.285]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:09.305 --> 01:08:10.806]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:10.846 --> 01:08:12.626]  We are into the second hour of live coverage.
[01:08:12.646 --> 01:08:17.747]  We'll be here until midnight tonight, and then kicking off at 8 a.m.
[01:08:17.787 --> 01:08:33.131]  tomorrow, right through until as late as we have to go, until this election is called, this critical election, or until they tell us that a couple of runoff elections for the House, coming up the next few months, may put who is actually in charge into question
[01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:35.150]  For several months.
[01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:37.591]  So there may be a cliffhanger to the cliffhanger.
[01:08:38.812 --> 01:08:40.513]  Now I have a bunch of big guests coming on.
[01:08:40.853 --> 01:08:45.556]  We already had Ted Nugent on, Roger Stones in studio, like he was two years ago on election day.
[01:08:45.996 --> 01:08:47.697]  Brandon Darby, head of Breitbart Texas.
[01:08:47.717 --> 01:08:52.260]  We'll talk about the caravan and Beto and the illegal aliens.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:52.920]  He's joining us.
[01:08:53.641 --> 01:08:55.302]  Millie Weaver from the campaign trail.
[01:08:55.682 --> 01:08:56.562]  Gerald Cilente.
[01:08:56.623 --> 01:08:58.764]  And then a whole big list of people.
[01:09:00.074 --> 01:09:05.218]  On the War Room at 3 o'clock with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone right through to midnight.
[01:09:05.238 --> 01:09:07.859]  And later, I'll give you a list of those folks.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.421]  In fact, I'll do you one better like we do in past elections.
[01:09:11.382 --> 01:09:19.207]  I'll post on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com the list of the special programming and who's coming on.
[01:09:20.628 --> 01:09:28.574]  We just got that done yesterday and we're adding more guests and more special information as that all unfolds.
[01:09:31.854 --> 01:09:51.224]  But first, let me just, in the rest of this segment, and then into the next segment some, let me go to election night as it becomes clear that Trump is going to win, but Hillary wouldn't concede for several hours, and then once she finally conceded what I said, because Roger's like, you don't look too excited.
[01:09:52.369 --> 01:09:56.993]  And the New York Times took this to mean that I was upset that Hillary was getting in because my ratings would go down.
[01:09:57.313 --> 01:09:57.893]  Which is true.
[01:09:57.913 --> 01:10:02.157]  If you're a conservative or libertarian broadcaster, and Republicans tend to get in, your ratings go down.
[01:10:02.357 --> 01:10:03.257]  I don't care about that.
[01:10:03.838 --> 01:10:05.159]  Like a lot of Republicans, I don't like.
[01:10:05.739 --> 01:10:07.421]  I knew Hillary was coming after me.
[01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:09.342]  I started Hillary for Prison.
[01:10:09.702 --> 01:10:10.303]  Lock her up.
[01:10:10.483 --> 01:10:11.184]  Our audience did.
[01:10:12.145 --> 01:10:15.688]  I flew airplanes over her campaign events, you know, saying, Hillary for Prison.
[01:10:16.048 --> 01:10:17.089]  Infowars.com.
[01:10:17.369 --> 01:10:18.570]  She called me the Dark Heart.
[01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:20.312]  And she's come after me since then.
[01:10:20.692 --> 01:10:23.674]  With threats and lawsuits and all sorts of dirty tricks.
[01:10:23.735 --> 01:10:25.736]  So, that's pure bull.
[01:10:26.157 --> 01:10:30.020]  I want what's right and good for the country and the world, regardless of what it does for me.
[01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:34.244]  But only looking at, would I have more audience if Hillary got in?
[01:10:35.239 --> 01:10:35.599]  Maybe.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.402]  But that doesn't matter, because I wouldn't even have a show if she got in.
[01:10:39.963 --> 01:10:41.244]  This is now life and death.
[01:10:41.584 --> 01:10:44.506]  This is now existential, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:44.927 --> 01:10:52.092]  So here are some of those key predictions, because after I'm done giving you those predictions from two years ago, I'm going to make more here today.
[01:10:52.353 --> 01:10:52.733]  Here it is.
[01:10:53.574 --> 01:10:54.254]  Donald Trump.
[01:10:55.035 --> 01:11:01.420]  And we look at the electoral map at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and DrugsReport.com, and it appears
[01:11:02.657 --> 01:11:10.603]  That unless they claim every other state that hasn't been announced yet, 4 or 5, to him, which is BS, he will be the 45th president of the United States.
[01:11:10.643 --> 01:11:15.647]  And tomorrow, Rogerson will be here, if there is this big victory, to break down, because we can't sit on our laurels.
[01:11:15.687 --> 01:11:17.209]  They're going to counter offensive.
[01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:18.730]  The empire's going to strike back.
[01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.271]  But I gotta shake your hand.
[01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:22.092]  What a strong showing regardless.
[01:11:22.832 --> 01:11:26.474]  I saw him claiming he was gonna lose all the media and got disheartened because I know the polls showed him winning.
[01:11:26.874 --> 01:11:28.195]  I guess that was just their con game.
[01:11:28.215 --> 01:11:31.136]  And I gotta be honest, I guess I started smoking the dope.
[01:11:31.216 --> 01:11:37.320]  The propaganda, I didn't say he was gonna lose, I just... And we're not out of the woods yet, but Rogerstown, there's a lot of celebration happening here and all over the world.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.780]  You just talked to Trump Tower.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.162]  The victory speech is being prepared, it's not yet.
[01:11:41.242 --> 01:11:43.563]  Give us the big, uh, the big, uh, I don't know.
[01:11:44.064 --> 01:11:53.375]  The folks in the Trump campaign are now satisfied that they have seen enough numbers from the outstanding states to declare victory.
[01:11:53.395 --> 01:12:00.784]  The croppers tonight, the real surprise is Wisconsin, Michigan never considered to be
[01:12:02.105 --> 01:12:17.932]  In the in the Trump orbit until late when Steve Bannon made a strategic decision seeing rising poll numbers in those states to make a major play for both states going after white blue-collar Catholic Democrats.
[01:12:18.672 --> 01:12:24.515]  Who are patriots, who are sick of these trade deals that have destroyed this country's job market.
[01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:28.376]  That will be the hidden story of tonight.
[01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:35.979]  Trade and those union members, I think, are the ones who will, in the end, put Donald Trump over the top.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:40.261]  So it's Reagan Democrats that now realize globalism is an F-job?
[01:12:41.082 --> 01:12:41.642]  Exactly.
[01:12:41.782 --> 01:12:44.443]  It is the Bernie supporters, in the end.
[01:12:44.543 --> 01:12:46.144]  These are the folks who supported Bernie.
[01:12:47.064 --> 01:12:51.206]  You said, be nice to them because they're going to steal it from him, and we need them to understand you were right.
[01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:54.688]  This will be a day long remembered if this happens.
[01:12:55.048 --> 01:13:10.976]  This will be, in the words of The Economist, in the words of The Washington Post, in the words of The Financial Times and every other CFR publication, if Hillary fell after Brexit and Russia pulling out, this will be a devastating event to their operations.
[01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:16.017]  All right, pause right there.
[01:13:16.497 --> 01:13:18.078]  Let's stop right there and back up a few seconds.
[01:13:18.378 --> 01:13:19.199]  Because here's the key.
[01:13:19.739 --> 01:13:23.162]  I then go into how it's going to devastate them and how they're going to strike back.
[01:13:23.682 --> 01:13:24.643]  And that's what's really important.
[01:13:24.663 --> 01:13:31.228]  But understand, everywhere globalism is falling from Europe to Latin America to Asia.
[01:13:31.728 --> 01:13:33.169]  Because people now understand the scam.
[01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:37.752]  And that's why even if they win this midterm, it's because they threw everything they had
[01:13:38.723 --> 01:13:46.969]  From all over the world, ridiculously at it, and they're still going against a trend of a global awakening and global realignment.
[01:13:48.431 --> 01:13:49.651]  That's what's so critical here.
[01:13:51.313 --> 01:13:54.755]  So I don't want you to get demoralized if they win tomorrow.
[01:13:54.895 --> 01:13:55.816]  I don't think they are.
[01:13:57.497 --> 01:13:59.839]  All real indicators say the opposite.
[01:13:59.899 --> 01:14:05.564]  But, again, there's election theft, there's crime, this level of censorship.
[01:14:05.864 --> 01:14:08.386]  The fact that they would do all this criminal stuff this nakedly?
[01:14:09.656 --> 01:14:10.757]  Has Trump just talked about earlier?
[01:14:11.518 --> 01:14:12.319]  With the censorship?
[01:14:12.959 --> 01:14:14.240]  That's illegal, folks.
[01:14:14.781 --> 01:14:15.622]  That's over the top.
[01:14:16.763 --> 01:14:18.545]  Shows they'll do anything.
[01:14:19.085 --> 01:14:20.887]  Let's finish up a little bit more before we come back from break.
[01:14:20.907 --> 01:14:25.732]  It is my high honor and distinct privilege
[01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.970]  Is this it?
[01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.591]  Is this Valhalla?
[01:14:30.691 --> 01:14:33.673]  Is this the best moment in your political life?
[01:14:33.793 --> 01:14:34.854]  It's amazing, man.
[01:14:35.374 --> 01:14:39.116]  It's... Right now, a historic moment.
[01:14:39.356 --> 01:14:41.838]  We can now project the winner of the presidential race.
[01:14:41.858 --> 01:14:43.919]  CNN projects Donald Trump.
[01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:45.660]  He's walking up right now.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.701]  You see him right there.
[01:14:47.121 --> 01:14:49.682]  He's gonna be speaking momentarily.
[01:14:49.702 --> 01:14:50.303]  Love you.
[01:14:50.343 --> 01:14:51.884]  Love you guys.
[01:14:51.924 --> 01:14:52.684]  Love all of you.
[01:14:52.724 --> 01:14:54.165]  What a great moment.
[01:14:54.185 --> 01:14:54.425]  He's back.
[01:14:54.445 --> 01:14:55.806]  He's wanting to keep us pouring.
[01:14:56.386 --> 01:14:58.628]  Need tax exempt on the F's?
[01:14:58.648 --> 01:15:01.229]  Get ready, you're about to get F'd right back.
[01:15:01.509 --> 01:15:02.250]  And Islamists?
[01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:04.411]  God, here come cruise missiles.
[01:15:04.891 --> 01:15:06.533]  God, Buckley, this is the good stuff.
[01:15:07.033 --> 01:15:08.994]  Alright, pause real quick.
[01:15:09.554 --> 01:15:12.276]  We'll back it up from the break point, come back, but understand.
[01:15:13.537 --> 01:15:15.178]  You're about to see the economy come back.
[01:15:15.798 --> 01:15:16.899]  ISIS, you're about to die.
[01:15:17.419 --> 01:15:18.200]  Notice, it all happened.
[01:15:21.482 --> 01:15:24.464]  And that's with Trump with limited control.
[01:15:26.323 --> 01:15:31.145]  As the night goes on for another hour or so, Roger Stone says, what's wrong?
[01:15:32.766 --> 01:15:41.169]  And I said, well, I can feel the eye of Sauron just went from looking at me a little bit at the time to swung around right on me.
[01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:42.170]  I'm like, huh?
[01:15:44.474 --> 01:15:46.537]  I mean, I could feel the rage.
[01:15:46.957 --> 01:15:48.779]  I could feel the enemy preparing.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:55.587]  I could feel that big red eye swinging around in my direction, and that shearing will destroy me.
[01:15:56.468 --> 01:16:00.113]  Now, I rose to the challenge, but two years later, I've been through a meat grinder.
[01:16:04.974 --> 01:16:06.295]  I'm Alex Jones from Austin, Texas.
[01:16:06.315 --> 01:16:08.877]  We have a global exclusive right now.
[01:16:09.417 --> 01:16:19.565]  We have Andrew Torba, the CEO and founder of the only independent pro-free speech libertarian site in the world that allows social media activity, and that's Gap.
[01:16:19.885 --> 01:16:22.027]  Speak freely is their motto.
[01:16:22.647 --> 01:16:29.853]  Now we all know about the tragic events in Pittsburgh where 11 innocent people were gunned down by a psychotic anti-Semite.
[01:16:30.433 --> 01:16:40.199]  But now, Andrew Torba, who set up Gab so that everyone would have free speech, is being deplatformed, losing his server provider, losing PayPal.
[01:16:40.679 --> 01:16:42.460]  They're trying to take him offline.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:49.464]  And CNN is spending more time demonizing Mr. Torba and the First Amendment than they are talking about the 11 that are dead.
[01:16:49.544 --> 01:16:49.964]  And why?
[01:16:50.764 --> 01:16:56.408]  Because four minutes before this monster went in, he said to the world that he was going in.
[01:16:57.228 --> 01:17:01.574]  As if that means Mr. Torba's bad if somebody on a message board posted that.
[01:17:01.694 --> 01:17:06.701]  So we've been de-platformed, he's being de-platformed, big media with big tech wants to silence their competition.
[01:17:06.861 --> 01:17:08.263]  They always say, go build your own thing.
[01:17:08.763 --> 01:17:09.585]  And then they come after it.
[01:17:09.865 --> 01:17:12.048]  So Mr. Torba, thank you for giving us the time this Sunday.
[01:17:12.468 --> 01:17:13.189]  You've got the floor.
[01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:14.291]  Please break down what's happened.
[01:17:15.703 --> 01:17:16.984]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:17:17.164 --> 01:17:23.890]  First, I just want to say I'm heartbroken and disgusted by this awful attack, this awful showcase of violence.
[01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:32.537]  I've been praying, my family's been praying, our community has been praying for these victims and for their families and for their friends and for the community in Pittsburgh.
[01:17:33.437 --> 01:17:38.661]  With that said, we've also been working with the Department of Justice and with the FBI very closely.
[01:17:38.902 --> 01:17:40.243]  We've been fully cooperative.
[01:17:40.503 --> 01:17:44.206]  GAAP stands for Individual Liberty and for Free Expression for All People.
[01:17:44.804 --> 01:17:53.226]  We have hundreds of thousands of users from all around the world, from all different backgrounds, races, religions, beliefs, that express themselves on our site.
[01:17:54.407 --> 01:17:59.808]  I believe, fundamentally, that the answer to bad speech is always going to be more speech.
[01:18:00.508 --> 01:18:10.371]  In this case, the Department of Justice and the FBI now have concrete evidence for a motive that they can now use in a case to seek justice against this awful monster.
[01:18:11.431 --> 01:18:19.795]  We have always welcomed everybody, and we will continue to fight for free speech on the internet in the face of tyranny from the mainstream media smear attacks.
[01:18:20.235 --> 01:18:31.080]  Because for some reason, instead of focusing on the victims, instead of focusing on what happened, instead of focusing on this monster, they're focusing on Gab as a scapegoat.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.721]  Gab did not kill anybody.
[01:18:32.921 --> 01:18:35.022]  No social media post has ever killed anybody.
[01:18:35.815 --> 01:18:36.355]  No, no.
[01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:40.217]  The only person that is responsible here is the individual.
[01:18:40.778 --> 01:18:43.899]  And I just think it's disgusting that Gab is now being attacked.
[01:18:44.699 --> 01:18:45.460]  I'm being smeared.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:49.001]  My face is being put up next to this guy as if I'm the terrorist.
[01:18:49.822 --> 01:18:53.724]  We're receiving death threats and enough hate on the Internet ourselves.
[01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:56.185]  We wish nothing but
[01:18:57.308 --> 01:18:58.248]  Good for the world.
[01:18:58.709 --> 01:18:59.789]  We welcome all people.
[01:18:59.849 --> 01:19:00.529]  We always have.
[01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:04.090]  And we are all about individual liberty and free expression.
[01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:10.413]  We are fighting for the very things that, you know, those in the armed service fight to defend every day as well.
[01:19:10.933 --> 01:19:25.958]  And I think that if people can give their lives to defend these freedoms and these liberties that we cherish, I think that we'll be able to stand tall and take these attacks from the mainstream media, this onslaught, and this coordinated collusion from Silicon Valley to no platform us from the Internet.
[01:19:26.698 --> 01:19:27.779]  Gab is not going anywhere.
[01:19:28.179 --> 01:19:28.979]  We are not afraid.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.901]  We will not bow down to the mainstream media.
[01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:32.741]  We will not cower.
[01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:36.844]  We are going to continue to fight, and the power of the people will propel us.
[01:19:37.844 --> 01:19:39.205]  We will continue to build.
[01:19:40.231 --> 01:19:42.233]  Whatever it takes, we're going to stay online.
[01:19:42.253 --> 01:19:43.413]  I don't care how long it takes.
[01:19:43.433 --> 01:19:44.434]  I don't care what it takes.
[01:19:45.095 --> 01:19:57.464]  We're going to provide a place where people can speak freely, under the protections of the First Amendment of the United States, without the tyranny of big tech, without the tyranny of the media, deciding what is real news and what isn't, and who can speak and who cannot.
[01:20:05.389 --> 01:20:08.031]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:28.881]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:29.462 --> 01:20:31.785]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:36.425 --> 01:20:39.428]  All right, less than 20 hours out from the polls opening on the East Coast.
[01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:43.592]  We're going live until midnight tonight at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:20:44.253 --> 01:20:54.023]  And the last couple elections, boy, we have millions of extra viewers that end up tuning into our streams at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com because you send out the link and say, hey.
[01:20:54.904 --> 01:21:07.475]  There's live coverage going on right now at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com of uncensored real analysis of the Democrats trying to steal it in live time, election meddling and more.
[01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:12.960]  If you want to know what's really going on from every angle in the big picture, tune in to NewsWars.com.
[01:21:14.082 --> 01:21:26.190]  And Infowars.com and email out to folks the pages that we post that say watch live on them so that you can share that information with folks.
[01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:38.697]  Let's go back to two years ago, two years ago tomorrow night, where we see the victory of President Trump, but then my prediction of the empire would strike back.
[01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:43.080]  Flawless victory.
[01:21:43.638 --> 01:21:44.118]  Here we go.
[01:21:44.139 --> 01:21:44.919]  Is this Valhalla?
[01:21:44.939 --> 01:21:47.622]  Is this the best moment in your political life?
[01:21:48.643 --> 01:21:49.083]  It's amazing.
[01:21:59.204 --> 01:22:00.925]  Right now, a historic moment.
[01:22:01.045 --> 01:22:03.647]  We can now project the winner of the presidential race.
[01:22:03.687 --> 01:22:04.548]  CNN projects.
[01:22:04.928 --> 01:22:07.450]  Donald Trump, he's walking up right now.
[01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:08.530]  You see him right there.
[01:22:08.951 --> 01:22:11.492]  He's gonna be speaking momentarily.
[01:22:11.512 --> 01:22:12.593]  He's got his point there.
[01:22:12.953 --> 01:22:14.794]  History has been made, Jake.
[01:22:15.255 --> 01:22:17.937]  This is a moment a lot of people are going to remember.
[01:22:29.664 --> 01:22:31.425]  Uma's getting moved out of Pennsylvania, haven't him?
[01:22:31.445 --> 01:22:32.645]  I think Uma's going to jail.
[01:22:32.685 --> 01:22:33.846]  No more spirit vendors?
[01:22:33.906 --> 01:22:36.827]  I hear that she and her husband are both plea bargains.
[01:22:36.927 --> 01:22:38.447]  Let's get ready, here goes Trump.
[01:22:38.467 --> 01:22:39.788]  Turn it up, Donald J. Trump.
[01:22:49.871 --> 01:22:51.372]  He's going up to the microphone.
[01:22:51.492 --> 01:22:53.473]  I've been talking for like 30 hours.
[01:22:57.535 --> 01:22:59.376]  He charges into a goblin's nest.
[01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:01.277]  This is amazing.
[01:23:01.297 --> 01:23:05.099]  As long as he doesn't catch the goblin.
[01:23:05.139 --> 01:23:05.999]  Goblins vomit.
[01:23:06.079 --> 01:23:07.220]  Catch him in bed with a goblin.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.401]  I don't think there's any danger of that.
[01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:10.981]  No, he defeated the goblin.
[01:23:11.042 --> 01:23:11.442]  He did it.
[01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:20.674]  Yeah, here you go again.
[01:23:20.694 --> 01:23:24.176]  I wonder what Mr. Maddow is going to be saying tomorrow.
[01:23:24.696 --> 01:23:27.758]  I'll take some more of that.
[01:23:27.838 --> 01:23:31.000]  I heard that she was a little depressed tonight.
[01:23:31.641 --> 01:23:32.882]  Oh, you heard that?
[01:23:33.862 --> 01:23:38.325]  She won't be able to make people poor and screw people over and F blacks over anymore?
[01:23:39.486 --> 01:23:42.388]  Oh, sorry, there's a big tax crisis coming to the communities.
[01:23:44.002 --> 01:23:44.422]  Thank you.
[01:23:46.062 --> 01:23:47.783]  And lowest black unemployment ever.
[01:23:47.823 --> 01:23:51.423]  Like we said, it's pretty amazing.
[01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:53.504]  Can you believe this is happening?
[01:23:54.584 --> 01:23:55.864]  Why do I have a bad feeling earlier today?
[01:23:55.884 --> 01:23:56.544]  This is so good.
[01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:57.505]  Let's turn to Trump.
[01:23:57.605 --> 01:23:58.565]  Thank you very much.
[01:23:58.585 --> 01:23:59.865]  Let's hear him.
[01:23:59.905 --> 01:24:02.465]  The President-elect, 45.
[01:24:03.406 --> 01:24:03.806]  Yeah!
[01:24:06.426 --> 01:24:10.767]  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
[01:24:15.877 --> 01:24:17.738]  She congratulated us.
[01:24:17.998 --> 01:24:19.419]  It's about us.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:28.284]  On our victory, I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.
[01:24:29.024 --> 01:24:31.485]  And this is so important to me.
[01:24:31.505 --> 01:24:35.767]  Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump's our new president.
[01:24:35.807 --> 01:24:36.608]  This is awesome!
[01:24:36.668 --> 01:24:42.131]  Those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people,
[01:24:44.389 --> 01:24:53.074]  I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.
[01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:54.655]  You're arresting Hillary.
[01:24:56.016 --> 01:24:56.817]  They're not going to back off.
[01:24:56.837 --> 01:24:57.617]  They have to go after her.
[01:24:58.017 --> 01:24:59.638]  They have to go after her.
[01:24:59.658 --> 01:25:00.579]  They're not looking for trouble.
[01:25:00.779 --> 01:25:01.900]  If you want to fight, you got it.
[01:25:04.818 --> 01:25:10.062]  We will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream.
[01:25:10.082 --> 01:25:12.344]  Do you imagine that they're crapping their pants right now?
[01:25:12.805 --> 01:25:19.730]  I've spent my entire life as a citizen looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.
[01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:21.391]  They're so upset right now.
[01:25:22.172 --> 01:25:25.655]  That is now what I want to do for our country.
[01:25:29.278 --> 01:25:30.519]  Tremendous potential.
[01:25:31.517 --> 01:25:33.419]  I've gotten to know our country so well.
[01:25:33.659 --> 01:25:34.981]  Tremendous potential.
[01:25:35.681 --> 01:25:37.003]  It's going to be a beautiful thing.
[01:25:37.703 --> 01:25:44.851]  Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential.
[01:25:45.231 --> 01:25:46.713]  To forgotten men and women.
[01:25:46.753 --> 01:25:47.814]  This is so good right now.
[01:25:49.636 --> 01:25:51.978]  All right, we got the crew in here, delusionally happy.
[01:25:52.018 --> 01:25:53.199]  Let's hear it from them.
[01:25:53.239 --> 01:25:53.920]  What's going on here?
[01:25:57.092 --> 01:26:04.517]  The thing is, good people never realize we have the power to overcome, we have to rediscover that.
[01:26:04.617 --> 01:26:07.679]  Listen, they're going to counter-strike.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.481]  I'm not over-confident, I'm not under-confident.
[01:26:10.521 --> 01:26:13.023]  Roger, they're going to pull some stuff.
[01:26:13.123 --> 01:26:14.444]  Obama's in for two months.
[01:26:15.184 --> 01:26:19.487]  We've got November, December, January, until the 18th.
[01:26:19.547 --> 01:26:21.068]  What do we do?
[01:26:21.088 --> 01:26:21.669]  The pardons.
[01:26:22.109 --> 01:26:23.650]  I've been predicting this year.
[01:26:23.690 --> 01:26:24.571]  Alright, pause again.
[01:26:25.879 --> 01:26:30.681]  Then I go on to talk about how they're going to try to keep him from being seated as president, which they did.
[01:26:31.581 --> 01:26:37.884]  And then I went into how they were going to come after all of us that were supporting Trump, and that's why he had to go on the offense against them.
[01:26:37.924 --> 01:26:39.364]  But he had to get the economy going first.
[01:26:40.024 --> 01:26:51.849]  Now I predict, and I've been saying this, that as soon as these midterms are over, whether he wins back the House and Senate or not, whether we do, Trump's going on the offense against the censors, the globalists, and he has now
[01:26:53.143 --> 01:26:57.126]  Announce that in a very, very, very, very big way.
[01:26:57.146 --> 01:27:01.770]  So we're going to come back and I'm going to air a little bit more of this right from where we left off.
[01:27:02.311 --> 01:27:04.252]  And then Roger Stone is going to be in studio with us.
[01:27:04.633 --> 01:27:06.234]  And we have a bunch of other big guests today.
[01:27:06.975 --> 01:27:09.757]  Please do not forget that we are listener and viewer supported.
[01:27:10.157 --> 01:27:11.899]  The globalists are trying to shut us down.
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.482]  As we speak, I have the Washington Post calling up.
[01:27:16.638 --> 01:27:25.746]  Gloating over how they're going to write another article trying to shut InfoWars down, and then how they then send the order out to the attack dogs, and like clockwork they come for us.
[01:27:25.786 --> 01:27:29.929]  So your financial support is absolutely critical to stand against these people.
[01:27:30.249 --> 01:27:33.292]  We've been able to do it so far thanks to you, and I'm thanking you.
[01:27:33.872 --> 01:27:37.055]  But we're having the biggest sale ever on targeted items.
[01:27:37.475 --> 01:27:39.277]  We just had the biggest general sale ever.

[01:28:09.895 --> 01:28:10.756]  Those are great items.
[01:28:10.796 --> 01:28:14.099]  They're best sellers, but they're very expensive and hard to source and hard to get.
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:17.763]  Cold-pressed herbs for libido, stamina, energy.
[01:28:17.843 --> 01:28:18.845]  It's the last run of those.

[01:28:28.595 --> 01:28:31.278]  It's way better than the original X2, which was incredible.

[01:28:56.599 --> 01:28:59.801]  Coming up, the conclusion of my predictions and then the new predictions.
[01:29:00.041 --> 01:29:00.442]  Stay with us.
[01:29:02.233 --> 01:29:04.194]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:29:04.594 --> 01:29:10.838]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:29:11.198 --> 01:29:15.161]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[01:29:15.681 --> 01:29:21.665]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[01:29:22.165 --> 01:29:28.187]  Ultra purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[01:29:28.648 --> 01:29:40.152]  With this fish oil formula you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive and brain health while providing DHA which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[01:29:40.632 --> 01:29:45.574]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3 is
[01:29:45.954 --> 01:29:49.899]  This formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:54.224]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:29:54.805 --> 01:29:59.311]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:02.176 --> 01:30:10.299]  One of the most amazing products that I've seen in years is Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse, available at InfoWarsYes.com.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:15.562]  Now, I've got some bags under my eyes, especially right now with really bad allergies in Austin, Texas.
[01:30:15.982 --> 01:30:19.223]  Mold's been at like 1,400 or something, as high as it ever gets.
[01:30:19.443 --> 01:30:20.324]  That makes me get puffy.
[01:30:21.564 --> 01:30:33.989]  But, if I use just one little container of Ageless, and I can share it with both eyes, within three minutes you'll see dramatic results, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:34.009 --> 01:30:38.110]  Because I've got some bad bags with allergies, plus I work 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:41.291]  Everybody knows fighting the globalists is a stressful job.
[01:30:41.712 --> 01:30:42.892]  So, again, just twist it off.
[01:30:44.893 --> 01:30:46.253]  Even, you know, a dummy like me can put it under.
[01:30:48.732 --> 01:31:02.345]  I'm not a big metrosexual guy, you know, that worries about my wrinkles, worries about things like that, but when it comes to having bags under your eyes and being on television or just you know, anybody in regular life, it's something good to do.
[01:31:02.966 --> 01:31:05.528]  And again, a lot of folks use one per eye.
[01:31:06.869 --> 01:31:09.552]  I have found that the times I've used it,
[01:31:12.498 --> 01:31:14.659]  I don't even need to use an entire container.
[01:31:15.159 --> 01:31:15.640]  So there you go.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.701]  I'm not a cosmetic person.
[01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:20.822]  I'm not an expert on skin, any of that stuff.
[01:31:21.202 --> 01:31:23.083]  All I know is over the years I've tried some of their products.
[01:31:23.103 --> 01:31:24.744]  They haven't done anything.
[01:31:24.764 --> 01:31:26.285]  Angelus has a massive effect.
[01:31:26.805 --> 01:31:31.227]  So you get a great product for yourself, for your wife, for your boyfriend, for your girlfriend.
[01:31:31.247 --> 01:31:32.548]  It's good for men and women.
[01:31:33.228 --> 01:31:37.190]  And you fund the InfoWars at InfoWarsYes.com.
[01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:40.092]  So let's see what happens in the next, I guess, two and a half minutes now.
[01:31:41.491 --> 01:31:42.332]  I'm a human being.
[01:31:42.452 --> 01:31:43.213]  I have dignity.
[01:31:43.534 --> 01:31:44.195]  I'm gonna resist.
[01:31:44.235 --> 01:31:46.477]  I'm gonna start recognizing the propaganda.
[01:31:46.497 --> 01:31:48.039]  I'm gonna break free from it.
[01:31:48.079 --> 01:31:49.461]  Humanity's gonna come together.
[01:31:59.901 --> 01:32:00.542]  So there you go.
[01:32:01.402 --> 01:32:03.123]  I just applied that kind of like a monkey would.
[01:32:03.163 --> 01:32:05.825]  Not as good as a woman or somebody that's good at this stuff.
[01:32:06.326 --> 01:32:07.527]  And I can already feel it tightening.
[01:32:07.567 --> 01:32:08.607]  It already feels good.
[01:32:08.968 --> 01:32:09.588]  Feels cool.
[01:32:10.509 --> 01:32:11.730]  It's pretty much dry now.
[01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:13.771]  I'm going to go back and look at the time lapse.
[01:32:14.412 --> 01:32:15.192]  It's pretty dramatic.
[01:32:15.592 --> 01:32:16.573]  At least in the past when I've done it.
[01:32:16.613 --> 01:32:17.414]  We'll see what happens here.
[01:32:18.094 --> 01:32:24.381]  It is instantly ageless, along with some other amazing products as well for the skin, supplements, energy.
[01:32:24.441 --> 01:32:27.644]  It's all amazing, cutting edge at InfoWarsYes.com.
[01:32:28.184 --> 01:32:30.607]  When you get the Jeunesse products there, you get big discounts.
[01:32:31.087 --> 01:32:32.088]  There's a lot of different specials.
[01:32:32.108 --> 01:32:40.837]  You can also sign up to be a distributor, and that helps fund the war against the globalists and help us continue to try to make America and the planet successful, capitalist, and free again.
[01:32:41.477 --> 01:32:42.338]  Wars are expensive.
[01:32:42.378 --> 01:32:43.098]  We're fighting one.
[01:32:43.418 --> 01:32:43.899]  We're winning.
[01:32:44.119 --> 01:32:44.939]  Thanks for your support.
[01:32:45.219 --> 01:32:47.441]  We try to bring you great products to make it easy to support us.
[01:32:47.741 --> 01:32:48.962]  And this one is a big winner.
[01:32:49.402 --> 01:32:52.284]  Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse at InfoWarsYes.com.
[01:32:52.564 --> 01:32:55.185]  You can also find banners at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:55.826 --> 01:33:01.529]  Just say yes to health, vitality, and opportunity only at InfoWarsYes.com.
[01:33:04.791 --> 01:33:07.433]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:35.641 --> 01:33:37.549]  Yeah, we're good.
[01:33:47.385 --> 01:33:48.625]  Over a year.
[01:33:48.885 --> 01:33:50.326]  That's where they will move.
[01:33:50.966 --> 01:33:53.847]  So we should bully Pulp and try to block that?
[01:33:54.267 --> 01:33:54.727]  I would.
[01:33:54.767 --> 01:33:57.147]  Because there's the deal.
[01:33:57.187 --> 01:33:58.948]  If they wanted to leave and quit, I'd do that.
[01:33:58.988 --> 01:34:00.148]  They're not going to back off.
[01:34:00.188 --> 01:34:03.409]  They're a bunch of arrogant a**holes.
[01:34:03.429 --> 01:34:06.229]  Yes, but they've gotten a real taste of defeat tonight.
[01:34:06.569 --> 01:34:13.951]  Hey look, how big, you've been in the career, nine administrations, in four of them, is this the biggest thing?
[01:34:15.778 --> 01:34:20.681]  Look, I thought Reagan's election was the greatest political eye you could have.
[01:34:20.781 --> 01:34:22.783]  This is ten times better.
[01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:26.325]  I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me.
[01:34:26.345 --> 01:34:27.926]  Oh, the public only knew how good it was.
[01:34:27.966 --> 01:34:29.067]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:34:29.207 --> 01:34:29.567]  Jesus.
[01:34:30.408 --> 01:34:31.709]  God, no wonder they're freaking out.
[01:34:32.069 --> 01:34:33.710]  They've got our phones tabbed, everything.
[01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:36.312]  They're hearing the conversations behind the scenes.
[01:34:37.172 --> 01:34:38.473]  Watching Donald Trump.
[01:34:38.593 --> 01:34:40.575]  We read our articles every day.
[01:34:40.795 --> 01:34:42.156]  They're shitting their pants.
[01:34:42.916 --> 01:34:46.259]  We just want to cut taxes, make everybody rich, everybody get along with each other.
[01:34:46.279 --> 01:34:50.663]  They are so pissed right now, all these old bankers.
[01:34:50.683 --> 01:34:51.744]  Where is Robert?
[01:34:51.924 --> 01:34:52.825]  Where is Robert?
[01:34:58.607 --> 01:34:59.628]  My brother, Robert.
[01:34:59.808 --> 01:35:00.708]  Yeah, plug's great.
[01:35:01.168 --> 01:35:02.109]  And none of this is perfect.
[01:35:02.129 --> 01:35:03.670]  The point is, he's not going to have to get us.
[01:35:04.110 --> 01:35:05.350]  This is a major victory.
[01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:07.852]  This is going to shake the world.
[01:35:07.872 --> 01:35:09.392]  We should talk about how they're going to counter-strike.
[01:35:09.513 --> 01:35:10.773]  They're going to give me a counter-strike.
[01:35:10.813 --> 01:35:13.414]  We have all day tomorrow to talk about that.
[01:35:13.515 --> 01:35:15.255]  Tonight, I just want to celebrate.
[01:35:15.355 --> 01:35:15.876]  I agree.
[01:35:15.896 --> 01:35:16.476]  This is surreal.
[01:35:16.596 --> 01:35:17.917]  This victory is truly distractingly good.
[01:35:29.412 --> 01:35:32.979]  Our work on this movement is now really just beginning.
[01:35:32.999 --> 01:35:33.420]  That's right.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:35.684]  The battle starts now.
[01:35:35.704 --> 01:35:38.609]  We've got to deliver tax cuts, industry, jobs, not wars.
[01:35:40.723 --> 01:35:43.445]  Tell me, Roger, he's not going to start a war, right?
[01:35:43.806 --> 01:35:45.087]  I don't think they'll start a war.
[01:35:45.127 --> 01:35:45.827]  Please, God.
[01:35:45.867 --> 01:35:47.128]  You don't have to ask.
[01:35:47.509 --> 01:35:48.510]  You'll be so proud.
[01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:50.771]  Again, it's my honor.
[01:35:50.791 --> 01:35:52.693]  It was an amazing evening.
[01:35:52.773 --> 01:35:54.775]  It's been an amazing two-year period.
[01:35:55.495 --> 01:35:59.118]  And I love this country.
[01:35:59.439 --> 01:35:59.979]  Thank you.
[01:36:00.039 --> 01:36:00.880]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:03.121]  I mean, this is awesome.
[01:36:03.782 --> 01:36:04.923]  Now is the delivery.
[01:36:05.503 --> 01:36:07.104]  Because with Hillary, she's not the goodest.
[01:36:07.124 --> 01:36:07.604]  We know that.
[01:36:08.285 --> 01:36:10.626]  But what does Hillary do with all her crimes?
[01:36:11.167 --> 01:36:12.968]  I kind of like saying, hey, we'll leave you alone.
[01:36:13.008 --> 01:36:13.348]  Go away.
[01:36:13.448 --> 01:36:14.449]  I get that, like, absentia.
[01:36:14.469 --> 01:36:15.670]  I'm going to be honest.
[01:36:16.751 --> 01:36:20.193]  It's like everything I've ever done, you two, it's like we're winning.
[01:36:21.214 --> 01:36:24.276]  It's just, they say America isn't special, but it is.
[01:36:25.317 --> 01:36:26.578]  It's like if you believe in her,
[01:36:27.683 --> 01:36:29.805]  And you stand for her.
[01:36:30.645 --> 01:36:32.927]  In the end, you get everything.
[01:36:33.488 --> 01:36:34.929]  And that's what made America so special.
[01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:36.730]  That's why they hate this country.
[01:36:37.351 --> 01:36:42.995]  And Trump, I don't know Trump like you do, but it seems like he dialed into the spirit of our age.
[01:36:44.036 --> 01:36:46.057]  And he knows, he gets behind him.
[01:36:46.578 --> 01:36:49.120]  He seems to have the confidence to know it can't be stopped.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.903]  Can you just spend a few minutes elaborating on that, Roger Stone?
[01:36:53.991 --> 01:36:59.455]  Look, I think that we're in a historic moment where the country's in desperate trouble.
[01:36:59.875 --> 01:37:15.805]  Alex, we needed a leader, somebody with courage, somebody with balls, somebody who didn't buy into the globalist agenda, who is a nationalist, who believes in American power, American sovereignty, American exceptionalism.
[01:37:16.846 --> 01:37:17.987]  The time and the
[01:37:22.276 --> 01:37:29.621]  Events have come together at a perfect precipice for a new American revolution.
[01:37:29.701 --> 01:37:30.482]  I'm just proud.
[01:37:30.522 --> 01:37:31.822]  This makes you believe in God, doesn't it?
[01:37:31.943 --> 01:37:37.166]  It's so, I look at everything I've done over 21 years on air, 22 years, it all was building.
[01:37:37.826 --> 01:37:39.628]  Everything I did was just a launch point.
[01:37:39.908 --> 01:37:41.849]  It was all, it's crazy.
[01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:47.153]  People that don't know God don't know that everything was this, and I realized what's coming next.
[01:37:47.513 --> 01:37:47.993]  It's crazy.
[01:37:48.614 --> 01:37:51.476]  It is a great time to be alive, but
[01:37:52.316 --> 01:37:53.517]  The fight is just beginning.
[01:37:53.597 --> 01:37:55.800]  Now we've determined who will be our leader.
[01:37:56.701 --> 01:37:58.623]  The globalists aren't going to go down easy.
[01:37:58.823 --> 01:38:07.672]  You know that they still have tricks up their sleeve and enormous... No, just because we got a knight on the horse in the armor with a sword, or with a joust, exactly.
[01:38:08.353 --> 01:38:13.218]  We are about to do battle for the Lord, and we're going to take back our country.
[01:38:13.378 --> 01:38:14.379]  It's an exciting night.
[01:38:15.154 --> 01:38:16.835]  What are the big epic talks?
[01:38:16.915 --> 01:38:23.820]  Because everything the system did, every power they had, has been brought low and has failed.
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:27.302]  Not that we're so pure, that they're so defiled.
[01:38:27.382 --> 01:38:28.343]  They're so low.
[01:38:28.363 --> 01:38:31.005]  It's why we're gods compared to them.
[01:38:31.545 --> 01:38:37.189]  And as they discover this endless cycle of how they attain power, they take us over.
[01:38:37.689 --> 01:38:38.530]  They think they're God.
[01:38:38.590 --> 01:38:39.450]  They become arrogant.
[01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:40.211]  They fall.
[01:38:40.751 --> 01:38:42.512]  They are experiencing now that
[01:38:43.593 --> 01:38:46.296]  That which we've always experienced and knew was there.
[01:38:46.316 --> 01:38:49.539]  How do they strike back in the 21st century?
[01:38:49.599 --> 01:38:51.621]  In closing, we'll end this live transmission.
[01:38:51.641 --> 01:38:53.082]  We've got crew coming in.
[01:38:53.102 --> 01:38:53.823]  They're going to cover it.
[01:38:53.883 --> 01:38:54.824]  Owen Schroer and others.
[01:38:55.385 --> 01:38:57.427]  But I'm so glad you were here.
[01:38:58.247 --> 01:39:01.370]  Are you glad you came to InfoWars for this historic announcement?
[01:39:01.711 --> 01:39:04.794]  Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.
[01:39:05.805 --> 01:39:11.547]  I'm just glad I had the opportunity to share this moment with 26 million of my closest friends.
[01:39:12.487 --> 01:39:13.548]  I'm delighted to be here.
[01:39:13.608 --> 01:39:14.368]  It's a great night.
[01:39:14.808 --> 01:39:15.528]  I'm punch drunk.
[01:39:15.588 --> 01:39:16.389]  I need some sleep.
[01:39:16.869 --> 01:39:19.830]  But we'll be back here tomorrow and talk about the challenges ahead.
[01:39:20.290 --> 01:39:23.731]  So, we're not totally dominating, but we're winning.
[01:39:24.271 --> 01:39:26.392]  This is a repudiation of the establishment.
[01:39:27.324 --> 01:39:27.945]  In spades.
[01:39:29.006 --> 01:39:30.769]  It's a new American revolution.
[01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:32.391]  We're starting over again.
[01:39:32.411 --> 01:39:34.533]  And the sky's the limit.
[01:39:34.573 --> 01:39:42.464]  When you have a leader with the kind of confidence and the kind of ability and the kind of independence that Trump has, anything is possible.
[01:39:43.311 --> 01:39:47.734]  Has the Infowar, Roger, in closing, not delivered in the Trumpian revolution?
[01:39:48.314 --> 01:39:50.335]  This is the tip of the spear, as you said it.
[01:39:50.455 --> 01:39:53.097]  This is Resistance Central.
[01:39:53.577 --> 01:40:02.302]  In the whole pantheon, in the constellation of the Resistance, the globalists, is Infowars not the critical spirit?
[01:40:02.922 --> 01:40:03.122]  I think?
[01:40:24.881 --> 01:40:28.787]  How much easier it would have been if there had been an Infowars at that time.
[01:40:29.448 --> 01:40:32.112]  This is, this is the New American Revolution.
[01:40:32.212 --> 01:40:39.683]  This is where communications among people... Alright, that is one year and 364 days ago and the enemy was watching.
[01:40:39.703 --> 01:40:40.704]  They made a documentary.
[01:40:41.405 --> 01:40:42.186]  Get me Roger Stone.
[01:40:42.206 --> 01:40:43.548]  A large part of it was that night.
[01:40:44.029 --> 01:40:44.930]  Hillary and others were watching.
[01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:49.476]  They heard you say, if we had InfoWars, winning for Reagan would have been easier.
[01:40:49.996 --> 01:40:53.381]  Well, now they've tried to take InfoWars and tens of thousands of other sites away.
[01:40:53.821 --> 01:40:56.945]  But the good news is, Trump was trying to restart the economy.
[01:40:58.041 --> 01:40:58.922]  And prove he could do that.
[01:40:59.322 --> 01:41:13.009]  Whether we win this midterm or not, Roger, he's now announced to Axios and others he's going after Big Tech for antitrust and for violating free speech and the Federal Election Commission violations and this incredible corruption we've seen.
[01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:14.250]  That's the big issue.
[01:41:14.290 --> 01:41:20.233]  The Democrats didn't have any real proof of Russian collusion or Republicans engaged in fraud.
[01:41:20.713 --> 01:41:22.174]  But we really do have them.
[01:41:22.234 --> 01:41:25.316]  They've been so reckless the last two years that even if we win,
[01:41:25.996 --> 01:41:29.459]  We must go on the offense because they've involved themselves in such criminal activity.
[01:41:29.539 --> 01:41:31.721]  It's our duty, not just our right.
[01:41:31.761 --> 01:41:33.342]  We talked a lot about this this weekend.
[01:41:33.362 --> 01:41:38.006]  We're going to go to break in about a minute and a half, but Roger, we'll talk about your prediction for the election when we come back.
[01:41:38.767 --> 01:41:44.491]  Again, former head of the Trump campaign, been involved since the Nixon days in campaigns and were instrumental with Reagan and others.
[01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:48.194]  Gut level though, do you think Trump's going to go after him?
[01:41:48.234 --> 01:41:48.555]  He better.
[01:41:49.255 --> 01:41:52.797]  Well, the real question, Alex, is why didn't he do it ahead of this election?
[01:41:52.897 --> 01:42:04.504]  I mean, if we lose the House tomorrow, it will be because of a flood of illegal votes and net censorship, which shifted control of the political narrative back to the mainstream media.
[01:42:04.844 --> 01:42:06.085]  Those would be the two factors.
[01:42:06.125 --> 01:42:09.207]  So he said the right things, but he has not done the right things.
[01:42:09.567 --> 01:42:14.390]  As I told you yesterday, my guess is he said to Rod Rosenstein, the de facto Attorney General,
[01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:17.093]  Rod, take care of this internet thing, will ya?
[01:42:17.254 --> 01:42:19.537]  And Rod said, yes boss, I'll do it right away.
[01:42:19.797 --> 01:42:20.578]  And they've done nothing.
[01:42:21.279 --> 01:42:26.367]  And I think it's going to, it is potentially going to cost Republicans very badly on Tuesday.
[01:42:27.759 --> 01:42:31.880]  You're foreshadowing there that you think, we'll tell people what you privately told me.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:33.241]  Let's just do it when we come back.
[01:42:33.501 --> 01:42:33.821]  Alright.
[01:42:33.941 --> 01:42:38.443]  And I hope you're wrong and I think you probably are wrong, except the fraud is so overwhelming.
[01:42:38.483 --> 01:42:40.423]  But we'll talk about it with Roger Stone.
[01:42:40.443 --> 01:42:42.364]  We have huge breaking news straight ahead.
[01:42:42.384 --> 01:42:47.786]  We'll have that video for you coming up too of the President saying he's going after the big tech companies and so much more.
[01:42:47.846 --> 01:42:51.807]  We'll be live till midnight tonight and then tomorrow we'll be live for over 24 hours.
[01:42:51.847 --> 01:42:53.528]  That's why at 3 a.m.
[01:42:53.548 --> 01:42:56.069]  we sounded like toads in that video.
[01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:57.089]  It was not the champagne.
[01:43:01.382 --> 01:43:07.305]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[01:43:07.505 --> 01:43:16.510]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way, often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits.
[01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:20.135]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[01:43:20.436 --> 01:43:26.665]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[01:43:26.925 --> 01:43:32.974]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[01:43:33.474 --> 01:43:40.478]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.
[01:43:40.739 --> 01:43:47.623]  Our gentle, natural laxative, unlike other laxative products, our low dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[01:43:47.803 --> 01:43:52.185]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[01:43:52.666 --> 01:44:00.030]  Start your colon cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:44:01.631 --> 01:44:04.652]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force!
[01:44:04.912 --> 01:44:05.172]  Go ahead.
[01:44:05.432 --> 01:44:11.014]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:44:11.214 --> 01:44:12.315]  I'd done the War Room.
[01:44:12.615 --> 01:44:15.076]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:44:15.096 --> 01:44:16.656]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:44:16.696 --> 01:44:17.316]  I was exhausted.
[01:44:17.636 --> 01:44:20.897]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[01:44:21.258 --> 01:44:25.879]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[01:44:25.979 --> 01:44:28.000]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:28.560]  The same thing.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:30.801]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[01:44:30.901 --> 01:44:32.142]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:44:32.182 --> 01:44:34.404]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:44:34.424 --> 01:44:40.428]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[01:44:40.708 --> 01:44:41.549]  You can sleep with it.
[01:44:41.849 --> 01:44:46.172]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:44:46.232 --> 01:44:49.014]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:44:49.174 --> 01:44:50.875]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:44:50.935 --> 01:44:51.675]  It really works.
[01:44:51.916 --> 01:44:56.459]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:44:59.060]  Believe me.
[01:45:03.884 --> 01:45:06.046]  Chase the Patriot from California.
[01:45:06.386 --> 01:45:07.007]  Paul Alex.
[01:45:07.387 --> 01:45:08.588]  Chase, welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:45:08.668 --> 01:45:11.410]  This is Chase the Patriot from Frontlines of California.
[01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:14.633]  So, I took your reporter challenge on YouTube, Chase the Patriot.
[01:45:14.673 --> 01:45:17.635]  I've been filing reports every single day, but I've noticed a trend.
[01:45:17.716 --> 01:45:22.159]  And there's this false confidence of the Democrats again, the same thing we saw in the 2016 election.
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.383]  So it's up to us to counter the narrative and to counter their lies.
[01:45:26.483 --> 01:45:31.688]  And one way I do it is with my YouTube page, but also it's through your t-shirts and your hats, Alex.
[01:45:31.748 --> 01:45:33.970]  I want to promote your t-shirts to everyone out there.
[01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:40.856]  They are great ways to meet people who have like-minds, and they start conversations, and you find patriots.
[01:45:40.996 --> 01:45:43.379]  And it's a great way to spread good messages out there.
[01:45:43.439 --> 01:45:44.840]  So I highly recommend it, Alex.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:45.661]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:45:45.681 --> 01:45:47.944]  When I say these shirts are like choose your own adventure.
[01:45:48.404 --> 01:45:51.728]  Wear a mohawn labe, you'll only meet fellow patriots and gunners, which is great.
[01:45:51.848 --> 01:45:56.995]  Wear a, you know, big obnoxious InfoWars shirt in red or a Trump pinch shirt, you're gonna meet your friends and your enemies.
[01:45:57.035 --> 01:46:01.120]  So it's a really great way to spread the word and exercise free speech in the third dimension.
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:03.580]  Hey, and one more suggestion on that.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:09.501]  You know, a lot of us have, we might have, I don't want to give away anything, but some of us might have a concealed carry.
[01:46:09.601 --> 01:46:15.623]  And I would like to see a button-up shirt long enough that I can wear untucked so I can still carry on my hip a pistol.
[01:46:15.723 --> 01:46:19.043]  And that's something if you put like a little American flag on the armband.
[01:46:19.203 --> 01:46:20.303]  Oh, it's total genius.
[01:46:20.343 --> 01:46:24.424]  The Info Wars, the Info Wars concealed carry shirt for men and women.
[01:46:24.864 --> 01:46:28.525]  Kind of like a cargo shirt or like a bowling shirt or like a...
[01:46:29.825 --> 01:46:35.788]  A utility shirt, and it's got an American flag, it's black, and it's got that, you know, it's not tapered, it kind of flanks out.
[01:46:35.828 --> 01:46:36.349]  That's perfect.
[01:46:36.389 --> 01:46:40.311]  Yeah, and you know, something you can wear to the office and nobody really knows what's going on.
[01:46:40.411 --> 01:46:42.732]  It just looks like a normal shirt they got from the mall.
[01:46:42.772 --> 01:46:46.094]  But if you can support the cause, you know, if somebody asks, hey, where'd you get that shirt?
[01:46:46.214 --> 01:46:48.235]  It'll say Infowars.com on the inside.
[01:46:48.415 --> 01:46:49.076]  Absolutely.
[01:46:49.096 --> 01:46:49.956]  We need to branch out.
[01:46:49.976 --> 01:46:51.357]  We've got so many great t-shirts.
[01:46:51.477 --> 01:46:52.337]  So many for men and women.
[01:46:52.677 --> 01:46:53.178]  Ball caps.
[01:46:53.198 --> 01:46:53.998]  I don't even promote them anymore.
[01:46:54.018 --> 01:46:57.140]  We've got the best shirts we've ever had, and that's something I never even talk about.
[01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:58.401]  So thanks for calling Chase.
[01:46:58.421 --> 01:46:58.881]  God bless you.
[01:47:05.805 --> 01:47:08.427]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:26.052 --> 01:47:27.854]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[01:48:04.869 --> 01:48:07.931]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[01:48:16.215 --> 01:48:20.639]  Well, Roger Stone's here in studio, and he was here two years ago, and he was predicting a Trump victory.
[01:48:20.679 --> 01:48:29.126]  So was I. I see a lot of indicators in the polls and things that are always skewed that the polls are closer than they were two years ago.
[01:48:29.146 --> 01:48:34.750]  And I see massive turnout by Republicans, but I also see massive turnout by Democrats.
[01:48:34.810 --> 01:48:37.813]  And I'm still hoping for a victory tomorrow.
[01:48:38.353 --> 01:48:40.075]  But bottom line, we talked this weekend.
[01:48:41.684 --> 01:48:51.666]  Less than 20 hours out from the polls opening on the East Coast, we've got to challenge the fraud and challenge the elections that they steal because they've already been involved in election meddling.
[01:48:51.706 --> 01:48:52.986]  The Chinese have been involved.
[01:48:53.286 --> 01:48:54.567]  The EU's been involved.
[01:48:54.907 --> 01:49:07.029]  As you said to me this weekend, as we talked about this, and we've allowed this massive un-American censorship, so let's give people, because I respect you, not saying you're 100% right, but let's give people the bad news.
[01:49:07.645 --> 01:49:10.147]  Well, Alex, my concern here is this.
[01:49:10.467 --> 01:49:22.734]  If we had an honest election, without fraud and without internet censorship, which has returned the mainstream media's power to control the political narrative, I think the Republicans would win.
[01:49:23.455 --> 01:49:26.837]  Even as we speak, I fear that we're being robbed blind.
[01:49:27.037 --> 01:49:27.857]  I hope I'm wrong.
[01:49:27.938 --> 01:49:32.280]  But let's take my home state of Florida, where you have a very close governor's race, a very close U.S.
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:32.741]  Senate race.
[01:49:33.741 --> 01:49:36.923]  Any person can register online and then show up and vote.
[01:49:37.223 --> 01:49:40.025]  How do we know that that person is who they say they are?
[01:49:40.405 --> 01:49:44.648]  How do we know that that person is a United States citizen eligible to vote?
[01:49:45.028 --> 01:49:45.588]  We don't.
[01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:50.711]  We are being flooded, I fear, across the country by illegal voters.
[01:49:51.152 --> 01:49:54.674]  So it's not a lack of confidence in Republican turnout.
[01:49:54.714 --> 01:49:56.295]  We're going to get our vote out.
[01:49:56.415 --> 01:50:01.178]  I think the president's done a great job on the stump, energizing his supporters,
[01:50:01.858 --> 01:50:06.641]  Framing the election, something I called for him to do here on InfoWars week after week.
[01:50:07.042 --> 01:50:09.263]  You can't credit him for lack of effort.
[01:50:09.303 --> 01:50:14.166]  He has busted his tail to energize his base and then some.
[01:50:14.587 --> 01:50:16.828]  But I don't know if we're going to get an honest count.
[01:50:17.008 --> 01:50:17.749]  That's my concern.
[01:50:19.554 --> 01:50:32.952]  And for me, whether we win or lose, if we don't go after the Democrats, they've set the precedent for draconian censorship, for outside money, for veto, getting all the hundred plus million dollars and spending a bunch of it to fund caravans.
[01:50:33.172 --> 01:50:36.938]  And the Democrats openly saying now they're the anti-American party.
[01:50:37.438 --> 01:50:40.582]  I mean, we've got to have decisive victories in the future against these people.
[01:50:40.823 --> 01:50:41.764]  We're dealing with cancer.
[01:50:42.125 --> 01:50:47.011]  That can only happen if the President takes control of his Justice Department.
[01:50:47.332 --> 01:50:53.340]  As I told you this weekend, and I really firmly believe this, the President completely understands the issue of internet censorship.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:51:00.761]  He knows that Infowars and dozens of other conservatives, libertarians, republicans are being censored.
[01:51:01.322 --> 01:51:09.003]  So he calls in his acting de facto Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, and he says, Rod, take care of this internet thing, will you, sir?
[01:51:09.463 --> 01:51:10.023]  Will you please?
[01:51:10.323 --> 01:51:12.604]  And Rosenstein says, yes, sir, I'll get right on it.
[01:51:12.944 --> 01:51:16.825]  And then nothing happens because Rosenstein is part of the deep state.
[01:51:17.225 --> 01:51:22.706]  So the president's heart is in the right place, but he does not control his Justice Department and they have done nothing.
[01:51:23.226 --> 01:51:25.708]  Nothing about voter fraud in this election.
[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:49.806]  A shock new Rasmussen poll released on the eve of tomorrow's election puts Republicans on point to be one point ahead in the race for Congress as an index of all the races.
[01:51:58.110 --> 01:52:02.192]  I mean, we saw 10, 15, 20 points being over sampled for Democrats last time.
[01:52:02.692 --> 01:52:07.535]  That was one reason I thought Trump was going to win, plus I saw the energy and what was happening and the arrogance of the Democrats.
[01:52:07.975 --> 01:52:15.319]  So even though they've gotten a lot of people to vote in the names of dead people and there's massive fraud and a lot of illegal aliens voting, they've busted them all over the country doing it.
[01:52:15.739 --> 01:52:21.782]  Despite that, I think this Democrat seawall of fraud, this blue wall, is not going to block the red wave.
[01:52:21.802 --> 01:52:23.363]  I just have a gut level feeling
[01:52:23.803 --> 01:52:34.131]  That it's going to be very, very close, down to the wire, that everybody drags out their aunts and uncles and grandma and grandpa and your sons and daughters to vote, especially in battleground states, that we're going to be able to win this.
[01:52:34.191 --> 01:52:34.792]  You're right, though.
[01:52:34.832 --> 01:52:45.460]  Things like the hurricane destroying the most conservative area, the Panhandle, where there's just nowhere to even vote, that is kind of the poison lining for the Democrats to help them win.
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:50.625]  Yeah, that's an act of nature that nobody could prevent, but it could cost us the governorship and a U.S.
[01:52:50.686 --> 01:52:51.947]  Senate seat.
[01:52:52.167 --> 01:52:56.352]  Rasmussen has an eerie record for accuracy.
[01:52:57.473 --> 01:53:01.297]  I'm uncertain of their methodology, but you can't argue with results.
[01:53:01.798 --> 01:53:03.259]  I certainly hope that he is right.
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:07.102]  I do think we've come a long way from behind.
[01:53:07.162 --> 01:53:11.284]  In other words, I do think pre-Kavanaugh, we were heading for a drubbing.
[01:53:11.764 --> 01:53:18.547]  Kavanaugh, I think, galvanized the President's base, and people saw the lawlessness of the Democrats.
[01:53:18.847 --> 01:53:23.209]  They saw them actively promoting violence, and they didn't like it.
[01:53:23.409 --> 01:53:27.491]  And they saw the attempted lynching of Judge Kavanaugh, and they didn't like it.
[01:53:27.591 --> 01:53:31.733]  And now, the media, the controlled media, just totally cut it off once we didn't buy it.
[01:53:33.354 --> 01:53:34.495]  Well, uh, if you...
[01:53:55.984 --> 01:54:00.868]  If you want to see what's going to happen if the Democrats take the House, look at the Kavanaugh example.
[01:54:01.308 --> 01:54:04.090]  This was the dress rehearsal for the takedown of Donald Trump.
[01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:06.151]  This was their dry run.
[01:54:06.512 --> 01:54:08.073]  You're going to see a duplicate.
[01:54:08.173 --> 01:54:19.421]  If the Democrats take the House, Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell and other vermin like that will move articles of impeachment against the President.
[01:54:19.741 --> 01:54:23.064]  Since they have nothing on Russian collusion, nothing at all,
[01:54:23.684 --> 01:54:30.348]  They're going to recycle the 19 women who made false accusations against our president during the 2016 campaign.
[01:54:30.808 --> 01:54:39.593]  They will have no more evidence than the accusers of Kavanaugh, but we're going to be told they must be believed because they're survivors.
[01:54:40.294 --> 01:54:43.436]  This is coming as sure as night comes after day.
[01:54:44.597 --> 01:54:45.438]  If we lose the House.
[01:54:45.578 --> 01:54:52.844]  You predicted a year ago that the way they were setting it up to come after you last, and I guess my name's in the hopper too, that they're planning to hang everything on you.
[01:54:52.984 --> 01:55:02.631]  That's now admitted with no evidence, absolutely ridiculous, that they're planning to hang the entire Russia fable, the fiasco, on you.
[01:55:02.932 --> 01:55:10.237]  And they're saying all over the news, is there any truth to it, because they lie so much, Politico, New York Times, Washington Post, that right after the election that
[01:55:11.458 --> 01:55:14.160]  That Mueller's going to the barrels, whatever that means?
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:17.002]  What they're saying is it's Stone's time in the barrel.
[01:55:17.042 --> 01:55:19.744]  Look, there's a lot of fiction and disinformation out there.
[01:55:19.864 --> 01:55:23.266]  Newsweek, the New York Times, and others.
[01:55:23.566 --> 01:55:29.650]  The truth is, there is no evidence whatsoever that I had received, had communication with Assange.
[01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:40.097]  There's no evidence that I received anything including allegedly hacked emails from him, or the Russians, or WikiLeaks, or Guccifer, or Jerry Corsi, or Santa Claus.
[01:55:40.817 --> 01:55:44.140]  It's a false, it's a canard, a fairy tale.
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:49.203]  So will they try to hook up some phony charge against me?
[01:55:49.223 --> 01:55:55.308]  Yeah, because I was effective in helping elect our president, because the left hates me because of it.
[01:55:56.008 --> 01:56:01.354]  I wasn't hyping the WikiLeaks disclosures to aggrandize myself, Alex.
[01:56:01.855 --> 01:56:06.961]  I was hyping them so that the voters and the media would pay attention to the news.
[01:56:06.981 --> 01:56:08.463]  Well, that was our whole strategy.
[01:56:08.963 --> 01:56:09.764]  We set it on air.
[01:56:09.804 --> 01:56:10.845]  We hyped it all up.
[01:56:11.246 --> 01:56:11.746]  Everybody did.
[01:56:12.307 --> 01:56:14.787]  But the point is, I acted on the basis of a tip.
[01:56:15.088 --> 01:56:17.708]  The tipster now denies that he gave me that tip.
[01:56:18.068 --> 01:56:19.228]  He has perjured himself.
[01:56:20.368 --> 01:56:33.131]  Mr. Mueller is well aware of the fact that there's an exculpatory witness that they have interviewed, who confirmed that Randy Credico, the progressive radio host, told me that this was coming, told me that it was big.
[01:56:33.211 --> 01:56:39.632]  Well, I don't want to get sucked into this, but you told me it's a talk show host in New York, he's going to England, I hope he gets a meeting and finds out what's in it.
[01:56:40.072 --> 01:56:46.534]  But Wikileaks has said that it's going to really embarrass Clinton and Podesta because Assange had said that on TV.
[01:56:46.674 --> 01:56:48.874]  Well, I was constantly trying to find out what was in there.
[01:56:49.114 --> 01:56:51.375]  I could never find out the substance or the source.
[01:56:51.575 --> 01:56:52.515]  I didn't know either.
[01:56:53.055 --> 01:57:02.838]  All I was told by my source beginning in early July and then with greater specificity afterwards that it was big, devastating, a bombshell, was going to take
[01:57:02.998 --> 01:57:07.179]  And it certainly was, and when he didn't release it when he was supposed to, Sons, we got mad at him.
[01:57:07.619 --> 01:57:10.720]  That's true, but here's the small print.
[01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:21.483]  When he did not release it on October 2nd, he said, according to Politico, that there would be weekly releases for the next 10 weeks, and that all of the U.S.
[01:57:21.623 --> 01:57:26.944]  election-related material would be released in the weeks before the election.
[01:57:27.284 --> 01:57:29.825]  The Washington Post reported that as, quote,
[01:57:30.385 --> 01:57:35.330]  Assange made vague predictions about future releases.
[01:57:35.671 --> 01:57:38.013]  So nothing I told... Alright, stay there.
[01:57:38.353 --> 01:57:44.300]  Ride shotgun with me, but let's do five more minutes on who you blame in the Republican Party if we lose this.
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:49.205]  Because it's not about blame, it's about seeing where they failed and let the Democrats engage in fraud.
[01:57:51.980 --> 01:58:00.208]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:58:00.388 --> 01:58:01.649]  Believe me, I know.
[01:58:01.869 --> 01:58:06.193]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:06.613 --> 01:58:11.618]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:58:11.858 --> 01:58:32.086]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[01:59:54.191 --> 02:00:00.152]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.172 --> 02:00:08.193]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[02:00:10.165 --> 02:00:13.748]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:00:14.869 --> 02:00:19.734]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[02:00:20.435 --> 02:00:24.839]  He said, it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[02:00:25.219 --> 02:00:27.341]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:27.862 --> 02:00:32.666]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:32.686 --> 02:00:34.268]  I sat down in the front seat.
[02:00:35.216 --> 02:00:36.798]  You know, as you said, Roger...
[02:00:48.385 --> 02:00:51.849]  The president needs to take action a year ago on the censorship.
[02:00:51.949 --> 02:00:53.130]  Now it's just rampant.
[02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:54.411]  But I understand he can't do everything.
[02:00:54.431 --> 02:00:55.112]  He's not perfect.
[02:00:55.652 --> 02:01:05.843]  But since you brought it up, here's a clip of him just yesterday talking to Axios for HBO, saying they are looking at going after them, Big Tech, for antitrust violations.
[02:01:06.834 --> 02:01:09.196]  So we want to talk about what's been happening on social media.
[02:01:09.216 --> 02:01:13.499]  A lot of people questioning whether or not these companies are getting too big, too fast.
[02:01:13.539 --> 02:01:14.860]  Your Facebooks, your Amazons.
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:20.304]  Have you put thought into how Amazon and Facebook specifically should be regulated?
[02:01:20.724 --> 02:01:26.448]  You look at the European Union, they find, I guess it was Google, billions of dollars.
[02:01:27.369 --> 02:01:31.232]  And frankly, I don't like that they're doing that because that's an American company.
[02:01:31.272 --> 02:01:32.753]  I don't think it's good that they're doing that.
[02:01:33.073 --> 02:01:35.415]  But if anybody does that, that should be us doing it.
[02:01:36.115 --> 02:01:37.978]  That shouldn't be the European Union.
[02:01:37.998 --> 02:01:39.340]  Do you think he'll regulate in the first term?
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:45.087]  You know, you get into the whole thing with freedom of speech and what do you think and... But what about monopoly?
[02:01:45.207 --> 02:01:47.250]  What about saying the Justice Department look into that?
[02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:52.017]  I have so many people saying that, but it's certainly something that we have looked at and are looking at.
[02:01:52.037 --> 02:01:52.958]  Would you ever break them up?
[02:01:53.418 --> 02:01:54.799]  They were talking about this years ago.
[02:01:54.839 --> 02:02:01.785]  You know, they were actually talking about this same subject, monopoly, years ago, long before I was in office.
[02:02:01.805 --> 02:02:02.866]  Do you think you were the man to do it?
[02:02:02.886 --> 02:02:08.250]  In fact, a lot of people thought it was going to happen, and then I guess a previous administration stopped it from happening.
[02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:09.090]  But you're in charge now?
[02:02:09.671 --> 02:02:10.271]  I am in charge.
[02:02:10.331 --> 02:02:12.913]  I am definitely in charge, and we are certainly looking at it.
[02:02:12.933 --> 02:02:13.754]  This is antitrust?
[02:02:14.614 --> 02:02:15.295]  Antitrust, yes.
[02:02:15.315 --> 02:02:16.356]  For Amazon?
[02:02:17.036 --> 02:02:18.718]  For all three.
[02:02:20.202 --> 02:02:20.962]  Now let me just stop.
[02:02:21.382 --> 02:02:26.363]  I personally, working with law firms and with Mike Adams and other groups, wrote three briefs that we got to the President.
[02:02:26.823 --> 02:02:35.025]  And I made the point, Mr. President, I'm all about not regulating, but the EU and others are already coming in with regulation because there's a vacuum.
[02:02:35.045 --> 02:02:38.986]  Because we're not regulating, they're bringing in the demands of censorship and control.
[02:02:39.006 --> 02:02:42.407]  And it's a cartel decision, so it's an antitrust decision.
[02:02:42.727 --> 02:02:46.628]  It's not a free speech issue because they're working in conjunction from outside pressure.
[02:02:47.288 --> 02:02:51.751]  And I was told the President specifically called in his lawyers and said that made perfect sense.
[02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:53.813]  That was three months ago, two months ago.
[02:02:54.133 --> 02:02:57.295]  To see it bearing fruit now right there is very, very exciting.
[02:02:57.535 --> 02:03:01.197]  Because here's the deal, all the other lawyers are scared to do this themselves in D.C.
[02:03:01.217 --> 02:03:07.742]  So I went out, spent the money, got the groups together, had the listeners hammer the White House with it, but also got it hand-delivered to him.
[02:03:08.022 --> 02:03:16.748]  So I gotta say, another big win, another big, fat, juicy torpedo that we have gotten to the President that he now is about to fire at the enemy.
[02:03:17.748 --> 02:03:18.929]  I think he gets it, Alex.
[02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:21.590]  I think in his heart he understands the issue.
[02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:25.271]  The question he's got is that he has an unresponsive Justice Department.
[02:03:25.772 --> 02:03:29.173]  This is also true in the area of voter security.
[02:03:29.973 --> 02:03:37.296]  I really fear massive fraud tomorrow because the Justice Department in this administration has done nothing to secure an honest vote.
[02:03:37.376 --> 02:03:41.198]  We're going to have widespread voter fraud in states like California and New York.
[02:03:42.318 --> 02:03:51.565]  I spoke to a New York police officer this morning, NYPD, who says the number of illegals voting in New York in his precinct are beyond belief.
[02:03:51.665 --> 02:03:55.008]  He knows because he works with ICE rounding them up.
[02:03:55.148 --> 02:03:56.089]  That's what he does.
[02:03:56.109 --> 02:04:00.232]  So you have massive voter fraud going on across the country.
[02:04:00.252 --> 02:04:01.132]  You've got to come back.
[02:04:01.573 --> 02:04:09.318]  You've got to stay then because we've got the head of Breitbart Texas on right now and I want you to talk about this because we have all the famous videos of Veritas.
[02:04:10.519 --> 02:04:19.144]  And they're there, you know, showing the head of New York voting operations saying, oh, we load the illegals and homeless up, we have them all vote ten times apiece.
[02:04:19.464 --> 02:04:21.525]  Yeah, it happens regularly in New York State.
[02:04:21.565 --> 02:04:26.067]  So when Andrew Cuomo wins big tonight, don't think that that's a mandate, because it's not.
[02:04:26.468 --> 02:04:28.689]  It's the result of massive voter fraud.
[02:04:29.429 --> 02:04:31.171]  We'll stay there for the rest of the hour.
[02:04:31.231 --> 02:04:31.951]  I'd shotgun with us.
[02:04:31.971 --> 02:04:34.814]  We have the head of Breitbart, Texas joining us coming up.
[02:04:35.254 --> 02:04:36.996]  Brandon Darby in just 60 seconds.
[02:04:37.036 --> 02:04:39.298]  Folks, we have a huge audience.
[02:04:39.378 --> 02:04:39.578]  You.
[02:04:39.618 --> 02:04:40.299]  You're wonderful.
[02:04:40.319 --> 02:04:42.481]  You're the heart and soul and blood of this country and the world.
[02:04:43.061 --> 02:04:48.706]  But without you spreading the links to InfoWars.com forward slash show and the link on the main page of InfoWars.
[02:04:48.806 --> 02:04:50.187]  Watch our live election coverage.
[02:04:50.468 --> 02:04:52.349]  The video links, the audio links won't get out to people.
[02:04:52.730 --> 02:04:53.550]  Send it out to everybody.
[02:04:53.630 --> 02:04:54.591]  Text message it, please.
[02:04:54.932 --> 02:04:56.253]  Call friends and family and say watch
[02:05:02.536 --> 02:05:11.820]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:14.142]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:05:14.742 --> 02:05:20.805]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:21.485 --> 02:05:27.307]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:27.767 --> 02:05:33.370]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:34.090 --> 02:05:41.053]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:05:42.213 --> 02:05:54.760]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:59.043]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:05:59.543 --> 02:06:02.265]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:13.459 --> 02:06:17.405]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:17.825 --> 02:06:20.149]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:35.205 --> 02:06:38.107]  We are broadcasting worldwide already into the third hour.
[02:06:38.128 --> 02:06:40.329]  We're going till midnight tonight with live coverage.
[02:06:40.449 --> 02:06:46.695]  Roger Stone with us as he was two years ago on the eve of the election and the night of the election.
[02:06:46.975 --> 02:06:51.459]  He'll be with us right through tomorrow night with 24-hour live coverage right through the evening.
[02:06:51.499 --> 02:06:53.721]  He's riding shotgun with us right now.
[02:06:54.201 --> 02:06:58.024]  Now, Brandon Darby, I want to get him in studio sometime because he's a fellow Texan for a full hour.
[02:06:59.005 --> 02:07:00.807]  Because, I mean, I'll admit something.
[02:07:00.827 --> 02:07:08.674]  It was like 10 years ago, I have writers here that are no longer here, and one of them wrote an article about Mr. Darby, which I later learned was not true.
[02:07:08.694 --> 02:07:14.079]  It was actually an article like defending Antifa from the Infowars perspective.
[02:07:14.139 --> 02:07:15.000]  Boy, I gotta tell you.
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:16.902]  And that's just a side note.
[02:07:17.362 --> 02:07:24.210]  Mr. Darby's been demonized by the left, they've made false documentaries about him, you name it, and now I've gotten to experience that myself.
[02:07:24.230 --> 02:07:30.036]  So I've apologized before without him on the air, but I apologize for getting things wrong a decade ago, but now we're getting them right.
[02:07:30.677 --> 02:07:38.645]  Brandon Darby, Breitbart.com, he is their Texas editor, Texas head, at Brandon Darby on Twitter, and he joins us
[02:07:39.286 --> 02:08:02.863]  Really, to give us an update, spending much of his time on the Texas border, Arizona border, working with ICE, about the caravan, about Beto, and reportedly the Project Veritas information, but also just the level of MS-13 lawlessness and how dangerous this is, and how crazy it is to see Nancy Pelosi and others call them all God's children, and why is the left allying with not just illegals, but the most
[02:08:03.263 --> 02:08:04.964]  criminal types out there.
[02:08:04.984 --> 02:08:13.930]  And as Roger Stone just added, if you just joined us, listeners and viewers, where Brandon missed it five minutes ago, he was talking to an NYPD detective that he knows quite well that works with ICE.
[02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:16.552]  He said, listen, I've never seen so many illegal aliens voting.
[02:08:17.092 --> 02:08:19.854]  And of course, Project Veritas exposed all that with undercover video.
[02:08:19.874 --> 02:08:23.897]  So, Brandon, you're really the expert in the two segments we have, so you can lead us here.
[02:08:24.217 --> 02:08:26.819]  Where do you want to start on the real situation on the border?
[02:08:26.839 --> 02:08:28.340]  Because you're one of the leading experts.
[02:08:30.152 --> 02:08:34.815]  First off, Alex, thank you for having me on and thank you for what you said while I wasn't on.
[02:08:35.456 --> 02:08:36.356]  That meant a lot to me.
[02:08:38.558 --> 02:08:41.060]  Like most things in the world, everything is complex.
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:41.440]  There's nuance.
[02:08:43.556 --> 02:08:48.518]  There's complexity to everything, and the border is the same exact way.
[02:08:48.538 --> 02:08:52.400]  You know, we have a southwest border that's made up of nine sectors, right?
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:53.080]  That's the U.S.
[02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:57.762]  border with Mexico, and all of those nine sectors are dealing with something very different.
[02:08:58.022 --> 02:09:01.624]  Some of those sectors have multiple things they're dealing with.
[02:09:01.684 --> 02:09:03.465]  Every 40 miles is different, right?
[02:09:03.505 --> 02:09:10.448]  And what the Border Patrol agents deal with, and what the Mexican cartels are trying to do, and the way that the Mexican cartels operate.
[02:09:10.928 --> 02:09:13.813]  So we, in Texas, we have several sectors.
[02:09:13.833 --> 02:09:19.123]  We have the Rio Grande Valley sector, the Laredo sector, and the Del Rio sector.
[02:09:19.183 --> 02:09:21.848]  That's all the ones against the coast, right, going from east to west.
[02:09:22.992 --> 02:09:25.614]  And we're dealing with Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel.
[02:09:26.094 --> 02:09:34.418]  And those are really the most brutal cartels along the border, across the entire US-Mexico border, because of the way that they do business.
[02:09:34.439 --> 02:09:44.324]  So it's very important, and it's very good that you're having your listeners, that you're talking about this and that you're bringing me on to talk about it, because we really do have threats, not only to us,
[02:09:44.884 --> 02:09:55.890]  But even liberals who are constantly worried about the migrants and constantly worried about Mexico, well it turns out what's currently happening, not only does it hurt us, but it also hurts Mexico.
[02:09:55.950 --> 02:10:04.134]  We're perpetuating the oppression, we're perpetuating the very systems that people are trying to get away from in the first place by allowing this to continue.
[02:10:05.945 --> 02:10:06.506]  Break that down.
[02:10:06.546 --> 02:10:11.651]  Is it allowing the lawlessness that goes back and forth from Central America to North America into the U.S.?
[02:10:12.712 --> 02:10:16.756]  I mean, is that what allows Mexico to stay so failed?
[02:10:17.904 --> 02:10:18.785]  Well, here's what happens.
[02:10:18.825 --> 02:10:23.389]  So, in Mexico, you have organized criminal circles or networks, right?
[02:10:23.869 --> 02:10:30.134]  And the cartel, the drug dealing part, is just one small part of that criminal network.
[02:10:30.655 --> 02:10:41.484]  Well, that criminal network, in the case of Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, they make as much or more from illegal immigration than they make from narcotics.
[02:10:42.111 --> 02:10:49.456]  So they're actually, you could call them drug cartels, or you could call them illegal immigration cartels, or migrant trafficking cartels.
[02:10:50.417 --> 02:10:53.999]  So what happens is, these networks have power in Mexico.
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:59.083]  They have so much power that they have someone who works in all of the news outlets.
[02:10:59.643 --> 02:11:02.525]  That person in the news outlet is called the link, and that link
[02:11:03.268 --> 02:11:22.781]  Tells them it works for the cartel and tells them what they can and can't write about which politicians they can support Which crimes they can write about which crimes they can't write about who to blame for those crimes So the media it's almost like you when we talk about governmental control or we talk about We look at the former Soviet Union, right?
[02:11:23.241 --> 02:11:30.666]  And they had the communist minders and all the news outlets and in all the media places That's what they live under they live under abject oppression.
[02:11:30.686 --> 02:11:32.828]  So anything that fuels and fun
[02:11:33.588 --> 02:11:37.930]  Those networks, the people, is in fact contributing to that oppression.
[02:11:38.451 --> 02:11:53.559]  And so when we allow, when we say, oh this is horrible, this is happening, and we allow millions of people to come here, or tens of thousands each summer to come here, roughly 10,000 per week, 7 to 10,000 per week, all of those people
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:14.053]  If they don't have the money to pay Los Etos at the Gulf Cartel right away, they get into indentured servitude and they make agreements to keep paying those cartels every week or two through Orlandi-Veluta or through Western Union, but they keep paying those cartels money for 10 years.
[02:12:14.773 --> 02:12:29.740]  And then that gives the cartels a beachhead here, and I'm not a rocket scientist on this, but if Soros and the UN can open up Latin America and crush the Mexican border, we won't just have a Mexican problem of illegals and drugs and human smuggling and these people being in district servants.
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:38.064]  Now it'll be ten times bigger and can all be managed and controlled, and then we'll build even bigger cartel bases inside El Norte.
[02:12:39.591 --> 02:12:47.582]  Well, so we have a major problem, and the problem is that basically it sucks to live in Mexico, in parts of Mexico.
[02:12:47.683 --> 02:12:50.547]  It definitely sucks to live in most of Central America.
[02:12:51.047 --> 02:12:52.610]  That's called a push factor, right?
[02:12:52.630 --> 02:12:54.793]  So that pushes people away from those regions.
[02:12:54.813 --> 02:12:55.514]  They want to leave.
[02:12:56.158 --> 02:12:59.259]  And it's our policies that create what are called pull factors.
[02:12:59.739 --> 02:13:04.261]  So our policies, if it sucks to live there, that's pushing them away.
[02:13:04.321 --> 02:13:13.805]  And then if we have policies that allow people to stay, that pull factor pulls them and it creates, I guess it finishes the circle.
[02:13:14.485 --> 02:13:16.226]  It allows people to come here.
[02:13:16.606 --> 02:13:17.666]  A chain reaction!
[02:13:17.766 --> 02:13:18.647]  A chain reaction!
[02:13:19.687 --> 02:13:20.868]  Absolute chain reaction.
[02:13:20.928 --> 02:13:37.379]  And so there's a good humanitarian argument to be made for border security, and no one's really making that argument, which is really stupid, because the truth is, is that what we're perpetuating, we're perpetuating a situation, I mean, think about, you focus on liberty, you think about freedom.
[02:13:37.899 --> 02:13:54.346]  If everyone in Central America or parts of Mexico who wants something better, who have that drive to have better and to have a better life for them and their family, if all of those people are allowed to come here, who is left to change and have revolution and change things in their nations of birth?
[02:13:54.466 --> 02:13:55.486]  Nobody's left there.
[02:13:55.786 --> 02:13:57.547]  And so it perpetuates the problem.
[02:13:58.737 --> 02:14:08.223]  Well, I don't think I've heard anybody encapsulate it in seven minutes as good as you just did, and I mean that's why I wanted to keep you on the show, because I see you on national TV, I see you on Breitbart, I see you on our other shows.
[02:14:09.084 --> 02:14:10.345]  Why is Soros in the UN?
[02:14:10.365 --> 02:14:11.485]  Because they're admittedly involved.
[02:14:12.426 --> 02:14:14.868]  Why are the leftists and the Democrats so involved?
[02:14:14.928 --> 02:14:17.569]  And like I said, Pelosi and others even praising MS-13.
[02:14:20.566 --> 02:14:25.829]  Well, I think that we're in a situation right now, and this is where we probably differ a little bit.
[02:14:25.869 --> 02:14:37.656]  Like, I do think that Soros-funded groups contribute to this, just like I think that the Catholic Church contributes to it, and so do Evangelical or Protestant churches in a lot of ways.
[02:14:38.096 --> 02:14:44.140]  I think that, for the most part, I think the average person on the left actually thinks they're helping.
[02:14:44.853 --> 02:14:47.114]  The world, and I think that they're wrong.
[02:14:47.314 --> 02:14:48.794]  You know, I think that that's the problem.
[02:14:49.054 --> 02:14:51.055]  I think that they don't have enough information.
[02:14:51.675 --> 02:14:59.337]  When the media, you know, this is a situation that you're in, and Breitbart's into it to a lesser extent right now, but it's still going through it.
[02:14:59.777 --> 02:15:10.960]  When mainstream media outlets and legacy media outlets control all of the news, and they control what information people are exposed to, and then people who are trying to
[02:15:12.279 --> 02:15:12.619]  I think so.
[02:15:35.603 --> 02:15:36.204]  Oh, let me be clear.
[02:15:36.244 --> 02:15:38.346]  I totally agree that most of the liberals mean well.
[02:15:38.366 --> 02:15:39.447]  I totally agree with you.
[02:15:39.467 --> 02:15:40.248]  I think you're right.
[02:15:40.668 --> 02:15:43.311]  And that's why they're so scared of Brandon Darby, because he used to be a liberal.
[02:15:43.671 --> 02:15:47.114]  Then he saw how bad some of them were, and he turned against them, so he's a big enemy.
[02:15:47.154 --> 02:15:50.598]  And then, of course, I watched their films and believed it, which shows I could be a moron.
[02:15:50.938 --> 02:15:51.739]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:51.799 --> 02:15:53.200]  Roger Stone's going to chime in as well.
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:54.561]  Brandon Darby straight ahead.
[02:15:54.842 --> 02:15:56.063]  It's live election coverage.
[02:15:56.083 --> 02:15:59.106]  We have one of the top border experts on with us right now.
[02:15:59.126 --> 02:16:00.127]  Brandon Darby from Breitbart.
[02:16:01.857 --> 02:16:14.788]  What I'm about to break down is so simple and so apparent, so prima facie, that I almost don't want to play 2001 Space Odyssey music to build it up.
[02:16:14.868 --> 02:16:15.268]  You know what?
[02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:18.250]  Simplicity and truth deserves it.
[02:16:19.346 --> 02:16:27.191]  Introducing Survival Shield X3, iodine in an energized quantum state, or an atomic state.
[02:16:27.531 --> 02:16:29.753]  That doesn't mean radioactive, it means elemental.
[02:16:30.393 --> 02:16:41.780]  All three forms, including deep earth crystal iodine, two other forms and a tiny amount of vitamin C, to stop it from oxidizing and keep it in that state of true purity.
[02:16:42.321 --> 02:16:47.004]  So that when it hits your cells, when it goes into your body, it has the amazing effect.
[02:16:48.137 --> 02:16:50.098]  We all need oxygen to live on this planet.
[02:16:50.138 --> 02:16:52.019]  We all need water to live.
[02:16:52.039 --> 02:16:52.699]  We all need food.
[02:16:53.539 --> 02:17:02.083]  But there are other key building blocks, other key elements, that if we don't have them, well, we got a big problem.
[02:17:03.124 --> 02:17:07.786]  And Survival Shield X3 is the next level of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:08.286 --> 02:17:15.189]  And what we've been able to develop and come up with takes the game-changing, trailblazing,
[02:17:16.828 --> 02:17:21.051]  Things that we witnessed with X2, and it takes it to a whole other level.
[02:17:21.231 --> 02:17:32.678]  We have it in two ounce bottles, we have it in one ounce bottles, and this is the best thing of scientists, chemists, researchers, to come up with a formula that is beyond true iodine.
[02:17:32.718 --> 02:17:36.440]  It is all forms of it, energized,
[02:17:37.677 --> 02:17:46.365]  Active and ready to energize the body the iodine in x3 comes from thousands of feet below the earth's surface hit
[02:17:47.524 --> 02:17:53.907]  From the oxygenation and radiation and toxins that are on the surface for tens of thousands of years.
[02:17:55.027 --> 02:18:02.971]  X3, ladies and gentlemen, is the, from our research, ultimate form of true atomic iodine.
[02:18:03.351 --> 02:18:09.694]  Fused with other forms of iodine and vitamin C to keep it in its energetic state.
[02:18:11.007 --> 02:18:18.234]  Look, I've got piles of papers and research and scientists I've been talking to for years, and to try to put it all in just a few minutes is impossible.
[02:18:18.774 --> 02:18:19.695]  But here's the bottom line.
[02:18:20.296 --> 02:18:23.639]  The globalists are pumping our environment full of bad halogens.
[02:18:23.799 --> 02:18:26.221]  Fluoride is just part of that.
[02:18:26.962 --> 02:18:31.726]  Iodine is the good halogen that the human body absolutely has to have to operate.
[02:18:33.121 --> 02:18:36.042]  And they have done everything they can to take that out of the environment.
[02:18:36.482 --> 02:18:42.885]  So our quest to bring people the very best supplements, the very best nutraceuticals, it was clear that iodine was critical.
[02:18:43.845 --> 02:18:47.867]  And we've gone through several permutations, and our research just gets better and better and better.
[02:18:48.147 --> 02:18:50.348]  And every time you reformulate, you give it a new name.
[02:18:50.988 --> 02:18:53.169]  Well, X3 is a quantum leap.
[02:18:54.594 --> 02:18:56.274]  From X1 and X2.
[02:18:56.935 --> 02:18:58.195]  And it's simply incredible.
[02:18:58.775 --> 02:19:01.116]  It's exclusively available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:01.576 --> 02:19:06.637]  I want you to go research it, look at the facts for yourself, but it is amazing.
[02:19:07.398 --> 02:19:14.300]  And what it's done for my stamina, my focus, my libido, everything is just incredible.
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:15.360]  And then I realized why.
[02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:22.362]  The globalists have wanted to get it out of the food and out of the water and out of the food chain for 50, 60 years because
[02:19:22.944 --> 02:19:25.120]  Iodine, for me, is like oxygen.
[02:19:27.395 --> 02:19:28.215]  It energizes.
[02:19:28.956 --> 02:19:29.836]  It gives life.
[02:19:30.356 --> 02:19:30.876]  It's everything.
[02:19:31.497 --> 02:19:39.240]  In your quest to have a better life for you, your family, your children, your wife, your husband, your co-workers, the military, police, you need to take care of yourselves.
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:41.620]  And iodine is the missing link.
[02:19:41.941 --> 02:19:42.221]  It's X3.
[02:19:42.241 --> 02:19:44.522]  It's available at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:19:45.122 --> 02:19:53.605]  In 2-ounce and 1-ounce, it's 50% off out of the gates and free shipping as our newest special at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:19:53.845 --> 02:19:55.566]  I want you to experience.
[02:19:56.326 --> 02:20:01.270]  This critical element that you're supposed to have for yourself.
[02:20:05.314 --> 02:20:07.936]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:28.684 --> 02:20:30.205]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:30.686 --> 02:20:32.187]  Because there is a war on.
[02:20:32.567 --> 02:20:33.568]  Or you're mine.
[02:20:33.668 --> 02:20:41.735]  This is live, continual coverage, but I've been trying to get Brandon Darby on for like a month, and I was glad he wanted to come on a few weeks ago, right before the election, because this is one of the biggest issues.
[02:20:41.755 --> 02:20:43.396]  And I think Trump's right to make it a big issue.
[02:20:43.977 --> 02:20:46.739]  You've got Latin America, 800 million people wanting to come up here.
[02:20:47.259 --> 02:20:53.264]  It's been turned into a huge business by cartels, the different aid agencies, once they get here and make money out of them, Roger.
[02:20:53.644 --> 02:20:56.286]  But I gotta ask you a question, Brandon Darby.
[02:20:56.567 --> 02:20:57.347]  I wanna ask you, how...
[02:20:58.487 --> 02:21:03.930]  How long do you think this problem is going to be allowed to continue to go on, and can it even be fixed?
[02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:07.791]  Well, yeah, can it be fixed?
[02:21:07.831 --> 02:21:10.132]  Let's talk about the ways to fight back.
[02:21:10.212 --> 02:21:11.233]  So here's what we do.
[02:21:12.213 --> 02:21:19.937]  What we do is I spend about 10 days a month, I have for the last five or six years, on the border traveling all nine sectors.
[02:21:20.017 --> 02:21:21.057]  I go into Mexico.
[02:21:21.097 --> 02:21:24.979]  Sometimes I have to sneak into Mexico because some areas are that controlled.
[02:21:25.559 --> 02:21:34.344]  Some areas, you know, when you hear about journalists being murdered, there's been I think 17 journalists this year, just in 2018, murdered in Mexico for reporting on cartels.
[02:21:34.924 --> 02:21:35.784]  It's very dangerous.
[02:21:37.445 --> 02:21:54.781]  But what we do is we go and we allow journalists there and cops there and others there who care, we allow them to write under a pseudonym and to share photos and to write about the corruption, to write about who's doing what, and we publish that in English and Spanish.
[02:21:54.821 --> 02:21:56.583]  That's our Cartel Chronicles project.
[02:21:57.003 --> 02:22:02.527]  So we focus on one cartel boss at a time, and we write about them so much that it makes the U.S.
[02:22:02.547 --> 02:22:12.674]  State Department embarrassed, and it makes the Mexican government embarrassed, and then they go after that cartel boss, and we effectively take them out by bringing attention and shining a spotlight on them.
[02:22:12.794 --> 02:22:17.718]  That is the responsible way to change this, and that's the responsible way to go about it.
[02:22:17.738 --> 02:22:20.900]  I see a lot of people talking about going down there with guns to stop it.
[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:25.984]  That's just going to make the work of Border Patrol agents a lot more complicated.
[02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:26.184]  I agree.
[02:22:26.724 --> 02:22:29.425]  I strongly suggest people don't do that.
[02:22:30.005 --> 02:22:45.211]  And what I do suggest people do is share our stories, talk about our stories, get to know these cartel bosses by name, pressure the State Department, pressure your politicians to bring it up, pressure people with platforms like you to bring it up, and people like me to bring it up.
[02:22:45.731 --> 02:22:49.253]  Because the more we write about them, they have to go after them.
[02:22:49.293 --> 02:22:52.414]  They did it with Toro and Reynosa in McAllen, Texas.
[02:22:53.194 --> 02:22:54.935]  We did it in Michoacán.
[02:22:55.256 --> 02:22:57.337]  There was a cartel there.
[02:22:57.397 --> 02:22:59.898]  The Mexican military was in there to look for the cartel boss.
[02:23:00.239 --> 02:23:01.279]  They never could find him.
[02:23:01.359 --> 02:23:06.883]  And then we published photos showing the military commander hanging out with the cartel boss fraternizing with him.
[02:23:07.323 --> 02:23:12.466]  As soon as we did that, a week later, they caught that cartel boss.
[02:23:12.726 --> 02:23:18.790]  That's how we can effectively challenge that system, like the same way that the United States and Americans
[02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:19.751]  We're good.
[02:23:38.551 --> 02:23:40.832]  Focus on these cartel bosses and take them out.
[02:23:41.192 --> 02:23:42.992]  And that's what we're doing with our Cartel Chronicles.
[02:23:43.092 --> 02:23:45.273]  I strongly suggest everybody checks it out.
[02:23:46.393 --> 02:23:51.835]  These are stories written by people in Mexico under a pseudonym and they're really good.
[02:23:52.075 --> 02:23:54.896]  Some of the images are hard to take, they're hard to stomach.
[02:23:54.936 --> 02:23:58.197]  Don't look at them when you're eating because they're gross, like violent images.
[02:23:58.597 --> 02:24:00.818]  But it's the reality of what's occurring on our border.
[02:24:01.528 --> 02:24:03.509]  And again, it's the spotlight they fear.
[02:24:03.730 --> 02:24:06.291]  Our mainstream media won't do this because they're afraid.
[02:24:06.311 --> 02:24:14.997]  And that's why when I said Brandon Darby, who I really respect in the last six, seven years, watching the actual work he did, then I saw what the leftist media had said about him for no reason.
[02:24:15.077 --> 02:24:20.701]  It made me really angry because nobody, nobody else consistently is doing what Brandon Darby does.
[02:24:21.221 --> 02:24:33.450]  With his team down there and what Breitbart does, when you see Breitbart being censored and attacked and lied about, when it's doing some of the best journalistic work in the world, just like Project Veritas, it makes me physically sick and angry.
[02:24:33.951 --> 02:24:39.675]  And exactly, it's like an authoritarian regime down there in these sectors that are under cartel control.
[02:24:40.356 --> 02:24:46.961]  And so this is America giving a voice to these dissident journalists and is really bringing sunshine to the situation, Roger.
[02:24:47.501 --> 02:25:03.491]  Look, Alex, I think we all understand, had Donald Trump not been elected, the master plan was to have the next Democratic president, Hillary Clinton, wave a wand, legalize all of the illegals, and have a permanent Democratic majority that could never be thwarted.
[02:25:04.091 --> 02:25:06.212]  Unfortunately for them, Donald Trump won.
[02:25:06.813 --> 02:25:10.114]  Now they are flooding us with illegal voters.
[02:25:10.655 --> 02:25:13.676]  The caravan is knocking on our door.
[02:25:14.197 --> 02:25:18.959]  I think the president has been very effective in the use of this issue.
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:24.022]  But the question really boils down to whether we can thwart their master plan.
[02:25:24.362 --> 02:25:26.684]  We need to build the wall.
[02:25:27.324 --> 02:25:28.425]  Let me ask Brandon Darby that.
[02:25:29.706 --> 02:25:33.390]  From your view, how has Trump made the fight different in the last two years?
[02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:34.531]  Better or worse?
[02:25:34.551 --> 02:25:35.492]  I know you'll be honest about it.
[02:25:36.834 --> 02:25:38.816]  Well, I think there's a couple of things.
[02:25:39.056 --> 02:25:45.122]  First off, a lot of this really doesn't have to do with Trump or anyone in the White House.
[02:25:45.783 --> 02:25:47.244]  What it has to do with is our policy.
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:52.402]  If we have a wall and it's built 40 yards into the U.S.
[02:25:52.442 --> 02:26:12.151]  territory, okay, which is where it is, 40 to 100 yards, most of it, and most of the existing fencing and the ones that Trump has authorized, if the policy is all they have to do is set foot on our soil and claim and ask for asylum, the wall doesn't do anything because they're already on our soil.
[02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:19.316]  You've got to get rid of birthright citizenship, you've got to get rid of anchor babies, and you've got to get rid of just, you get here, you get asylum.
[02:26:20.462 --> 02:26:22.703]  But a lot of it, yes, it's about policy.
[02:26:22.803 --> 02:26:25.704]  And not only is it about policy, but there's another thing.
[02:26:25.744 --> 02:26:26.984]  It's about our tone, right?
[02:26:27.324 --> 02:26:37.247]  The simple fact is the majority of people in Mexico and the majority of people along the border who are from Mexico, who are living in this country, they are natural conservatives.
[02:26:37.347 --> 02:26:38.347]  It's the weirdest thing.
[02:26:38.387 --> 02:26:41.789]  They will vote Democrats because of the way the Democrats pander to them.
[02:26:42.549 --> 02:26:43.709]  They believe in family.
[02:26:44.509 --> 02:26:46.930]  They believe that the man is the head of the family.
[02:26:47.170 --> 02:26:49.671]  They respect their fathers and their mothers.
[02:26:50.336 --> 02:26:53.278]  They don't like abortion.
[02:26:53.298 --> 02:26:55.219]  That's why they didn't vote for Wendy Davis.
[02:26:55.299 --> 02:27:00.922]  If you look at when Wendy Davis ran, she lost most of the border regions that were full of Mexican-Americans.
[02:27:01.002 --> 02:27:01.283]  Why?
[02:27:01.323 --> 02:27:03.784]  Because she was too lefty, too out there.
[02:27:03.824 --> 02:27:06.366]  Well, she loved abortion, and people are like, that's evil.
[02:27:07.318 --> 02:27:07.898]  No, I agree.
[02:27:07.918 --> 02:27:11.201]  We have to have it where if you're really a Mexican and you want to go back and forth, that's fine.
[02:27:11.781 --> 02:27:13.302]  We ought to make it as long as it's legal and lawful.
[02:27:13.322 --> 02:27:14.123]  You can go back and forth.
[02:27:14.163 --> 02:27:14.983]  We all should be able to.
[02:27:15.003 --> 02:27:20.847]  But if you're coming in, you're a criminal, you're from Central America, you're part of some globalist operation, you don't get in.
[02:27:22.408 --> 02:27:25.710]  Well, so the bottom line, though, is that it's about tone.
[02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:29.893]  So I like that Donald Trump, like the Border Patrol agents, feel inspired.
[02:27:29.913 --> 02:27:33.435]  They have a higher morale than they had under Obama, obviously.
[02:27:33.855 --> 02:27:34.496]  That's awesome.
[02:27:35.655 --> 02:27:36.115]  That's awesome.
[02:27:55.201 --> 02:27:58.124]  I agree with the policies, but I wish he would talk.
[02:27:58.665 --> 02:27:59.566]  It's about our tone.
[02:28:00.007 --> 02:28:07.656]  So we can realize that there are good people there trying to better their country, and that most of the people coming here really aren't criminals.
[02:28:07.796 --> 02:28:08.497]  I understand that.
[02:28:08.577 --> 02:28:14.044]  I don't think we should let most of the people stay here or come here, but that most of them really are coming just to work.
[02:28:14.284 --> 02:28:17.646]  No, I agree, but then it creates the magnet to bring in the criminals that are with him.
[02:28:17.967 --> 02:28:19.307]  Brandon, promise you'll come back.
[02:28:20.208 --> 02:28:21.969]  Promise you'll come back soon or even come in studio.
[02:28:22.189 --> 02:28:22.610]  Anytime.
[02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:23.610]  Anytime.
[02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:25.492]  You just let me know and I'll work that out.
[02:28:25.652 --> 02:28:27.033]  Again, how do people find your work?
[02:28:27.393 --> 02:28:29.815]  At Brandon Darby on Twitter and at Breitbart.com.
[02:28:29.835 --> 02:28:30.195]  How else?
[02:28:31.725 --> 02:28:35.107]  Just Google Cartel Chronicles and look at our stories.
[02:28:35.967 --> 02:28:36.827]  They'll blow you away.
[02:28:37.107 --> 02:28:38.048]  They'll blow you away.
[02:28:38.088 --> 02:28:42.950]  What's going on along our border, the media does not focus on it, and it does a big disservice.
[02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:46.231]  It keeps people from knowing the truth.
[02:28:47.352 --> 02:28:49.953]  Well, I don't think anybody's got their finger on the pulse like you.
[02:28:49.973 --> 02:28:51.673]  That's why I'm serious.
[02:28:51.973 --> 02:28:55.155]  So anytime you want to come in studio, too, when you're in Austin, we can do a whole presentation.
[02:28:55.435 --> 02:28:56.095]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:56.215 --> 02:28:56.755]  Thank you, Brandon.
[02:28:56.795 --> 02:28:57.856]  We'll be back with Roger Stone.
[02:29:01.229 --> 02:29:07.094]  Yeah, Halloween was intense.
[02:29:07.154 --> 02:29:09.677]  Everyone had outrage because of outfits.
[02:29:10.377 --> 02:29:15.081]  Like the big thing around college campuses was it's a culture, not a costume.
[02:29:15.542 --> 02:29:20.967]  And so they get mad at white people wearing like sombreros or like those rice paddy hats or any of those big hats.
[02:29:21.507 --> 02:29:25.431]  Yeah, I think it's way more racist to say that all Mexicans wear sombreros.
[02:29:28.519 --> 02:29:30.160]  Do you understand my line of thinking?
[02:29:30.180 --> 02:29:33.643]  Where it's like, don't wear the, don't wear the sombrero, because that's their hat.
[02:29:34.503 --> 02:29:35.304]  It's like, what?
[02:29:36.125 --> 02:29:37.626]  You think that's like their hat?
[02:29:39.587 --> 02:29:43.690]  It's the same with, I want a sombrero, I want a rice paddy hat, because I don't like the sun.
[02:29:44.071 --> 02:29:45.712]  That's a killer hat for white people.
[02:29:45.732 --> 02:29:47.953]  You gotta have that big old brim.
[02:29:48.674 --> 02:29:53.978]  You know, it seems like the left, the authoritarians, whatever you want to call them, the ruling elite,
[02:29:54.927 --> 02:29:57.930]  They have a list over who's protected at that moment.
[02:29:57.970 --> 02:30:06.456]  It's usually based on some sort of dystopian future that they're trying to roll out for us so a small amount of people can become incredibly wealthy and powerful.
[02:30:07.257 --> 02:30:09.279]  And who you can and can't mock.
[02:30:10.139 --> 02:30:16.945]  And so, if I was... Like, there is no outfit that you can't
[02:30:18.391 --> 02:30:22.114]  That should be off limits, because everything would quote-unquote offend someone.
[02:30:22.134 --> 02:30:24.757]  The concept of offense is mind-blowing.
[02:30:25.138 --> 02:30:28.861]  If someone tells me they're offended, I'm just like, oh, I'm sorry to hear how weak you are.
[02:30:29.322 --> 02:30:33.446]  Like, I feel like they're kind of almost like opening up to me, like admitting how weak they are.
[02:30:33.486 --> 02:30:37.250]  It's almost like saying, like, that they have herpes or something, where it's like, hey man, I'm offended.
[02:30:37.350 --> 02:30:40.554]  I'm like, I'm so sorry that you were raised so badly and you're so weak.
[02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:47.174]  Uh, because when you think about cultural appropriation, all it does is it tries to put people into boxes.
[02:30:48.135 --> 02:30:51.237]  And that's what globalists want to do.
[02:30:51.317 --> 02:31:02.145]  If you look at Agenda 21 or any of these things that I've been exposed to ever since I've been watching Alex Jones' show, ever since he got censored, I started watching him and now I'm exposed to all this stuff of nightmares.
[02:31:02.606 --> 02:31:03.887]  Look at Agenda 21.
[02:31:04.187 --> 02:31:06.349]  But anyway, so I started thinking about it.
[02:31:06.509 --> 02:31:09.371]  If anyone needs a sombrero, it's the whites.
[02:31:10.137 --> 02:31:17.182]  Because I was looking at this guy, I'm like, the sun is beating down on our white skin and we need a giant brim.
[02:31:17.222 --> 02:31:25.867]  And this is how, this is why I believe that God has a sense of humor, because the whitest people on the planet, pasty, very white people, traditionally white people, have the smallest hats.
[02:31:26.047 --> 02:31:27.348]  And of course, I'm referring to the Jews.
[02:31:28.008 --> 02:31:31.751]  The Jews have a tiny little hat called a yarmulke, and it doesn't have a brim at all.
[02:31:31.771 --> 02:31:33.352]  It looks like a swim cap for a kitten.
[02:31:34.052 --> 02:31:41.757]  And so they have no sun protection, but yet these Hispanic people with these beautiful brown resilient skin to the sun of these giant brims.
[02:31:41.837 --> 02:31:46.820]  So my proposal is for Mexicans and Jews to switch hats.
[02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:49.262]  And see, that's actual problem solving.
[02:31:49.322 --> 02:31:51.983]  You know, if anyone needs a sombrero, it's the whites.
[02:31:52.103 --> 02:31:54.325]  And if anyone needs a larger hat, it's the Jews.
[02:31:54.525 --> 02:31:57.687]  And so I believe that that is how we actually start solving some problems.
[02:32:03.445 --> 02:32:05.447]  Introducing Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[02:32:05.467 --> 02:32:10.293]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[02:32:10.453 --> 02:32:14.057]  Ultimate Bone Broth to help you save big on this new product and stock up.
[02:32:14.097 --> 02:32:16.560]  We're dropping the price to $19.95.
[02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:21.345]  Our previous supplier was unable to get the incredible ingredients while keeping the
[02:32:21.545 --> 02:32:22.166]  We're good.
[02:32:36.579 --> 02:32:37.860]  We're good to go.
[02:33:05.267 --> 02:33:07.891]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:35.083 --> 02:33:39.466]  We now take you live to the eve of the midterms 2018 global election.
[02:33:39.806 --> 02:33:47.691]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:48.031 --> 02:33:50.492]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:51.073 --> 02:33:59.238]  It is a referendum on nationalism versus globalism and I believed on the eve of the 2016 election that Trump would win when nobody else did but
[02:34:00.174 --> 02:34:02.657]  I had a lot of indicators and evidence of why that was the case.
[02:34:02.717 --> 02:34:04.640]  And those indicators are still there.
[02:34:05.261 --> 02:34:05.962]  Fake polls.
[02:34:06.442 --> 02:34:07.644]  Massive Republican turnout.
[02:34:07.704 --> 02:34:09.346]  But we've seen massive Democrat turnout.
[02:34:09.686 --> 02:34:11.489]  Illegal aliens voting all over the country.
[02:34:11.549 --> 02:34:12.209]  Caught red-handed.
[02:34:12.510 --> 02:34:13.771]  Veritas documenting it.
[02:34:14.665 --> 02:34:16.085]  Undercover video showing it.
[02:34:16.726 --> 02:34:27.069]  Arrest all over the country of Democrats mailing out absentee ballots and early ballots to people's homes, then being filled out and delivered back and almost no coverage of it.
[02:34:27.609 --> 02:34:37.192]  Roger Stone, recap the predictions you've been making and then get into the shocking thing you told me earlier about the New York detective that's a good friend of yours that told you earlier today.
[02:34:37.512 --> 02:34:44.776]  You know, Alex, as I said earlier, I think if we had an honest election, Donald Trump and the Republicans would triumph again.
[02:34:45.437 --> 02:34:47.658]  But the difference is internet censorship.
[02:34:48.138 --> 02:34:56.564]  When you shift control of the entire political coverage and political narrative back to the mainstream media, when you shut down
[02:34:57.704 --> 02:35:15.318]  Access from all of these various pro-conservative, pro-Republican media outlets, when you take down millions of pages of Facebook followers, when you censor InfoWars, when you censor people on Reddit, they're controlling the political narrative.
[02:35:15.418 --> 02:35:16.519]  That's the difference.
[02:35:16.599 --> 02:35:19.181]  Now add to that massive voter fraud.
[02:35:20.061 --> 02:35:28.130]  Which is recurring even today and tomorrow in early voting and absentee battling, as well as tomorrow at the actual polls.
[02:35:28.571 --> 02:35:30.313]  And you have a recipe for disaster.
[02:35:30.493 --> 02:35:31.654]  That is my concern.
[02:35:31.714 --> 02:35:33.516]  It's not that we don't still have the numbers.
[02:35:33.957 --> 02:35:34.397]  We do.
[02:35:34.798 --> 02:35:36.940]  I don't think we're going to get an honest count.
[02:35:37.261 --> 02:35:38.122]  That's my concern.
[02:35:38.522 --> 02:35:47.405]  Now I spoke to a New York detective today, the NYPD, a guy whose specific job is tracking down illegals.
[02:35:47.765 --> 02:35:49.666]  Works very closely with ICE.
[02:35:50.266 --> 02:35:55.868]  Privately, he's a Great Info Wars follower and a supporter of Donald Trump.
[02:35:56.008 --> 02:35:59.909]  And he told me that he has never seen the number of illegals
[02:36:00.809 --> 02:36:07.395]  Non-citizens voting as he is seen in his own precinct today as well as other parts of New York.
[02:36:08.156 --> 02:36:16.202]  So this is not a limited phenomena and unfortunately the Trump Justice Department has done nothing whatsoever
[02:36:16.903 --> 02:36:20.207]  To guarantee the integrity of this election.
[02:36:21.007 --> 02:36:30.777]  We've been screaming about voter fraud and illegal voter activities and the mainstream media continues to try to pretend that it just doesn't exist.
[02:36:30.818 --> 02:36:32.619]  That there is no voter fraud.
[02:36:34.101 --> 02:36:44.229]  And it's beyond the question of the manipulation of the computerized voting machines, which is a whole other level of concern inside these democratic, urban machines.
[02:36:44.629 --> 02:36:48.112]  So take New Jersey, for example, where you have a surprisingly close U.S.
[02:36:48.393 --> 02:36:48.593]  race.
[02:36:49.153 --> 02:37:00.875]  Even though the Republican Party locally has been decimated most people have figured out that Bob Menendez is a crook and the bad publicity that he got about his investigation has put him in a close race.
[02:37:01.496 --> 02:37:09.177]  But I don't think in the end the level of voter theft in the city of Newark will be so great it will be hard to overcome.
[02:37:11.138 --> 02:37:18.019]  I concur with you and again we're seeing record Republican turnout but we're seeing record
[02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:20.350]  We're good to go.
[02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:50.251]  Fascinating.
[02:37:50.451 --> 02:37:52.172]  Roger, I think you made a very good point.
[02:37:52.693 --> 02:37:53.814]  Wouldn't it be interesting?
[02:37:54.874 --> 02:37:57.737]  You see nationalism on the rise everywhere.
[02:37:57.777 --> 02:38:01.880]  You see the Bolsonaro victory in South America.
[02:38:02.361 --> 02:38:04.503]  You see us winning in Europe.
[02:38:04.663 --> 02:38:06.584]  You see what's happening in Eastern Europe.
[02:38:07.145 --> 02:38:10.788]  It would be an anomaly if we lose tomorrow's election.
[02:38:11.068 --> 02:38:15.032]  And that anomaly is caused by cold, hard cash.
[02:38:15.652 --> 02:38:21.336]  By the interference of George Soros and the EU and the Chinese in this election.
[02:38:21.376 --> 02:38:22.577]  We'll talk more about that.
[02:38:23.257 --> 02:38:27.080]  As well as the lethal combination of massive voter fraud.
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:27.820]  Censorship.
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:30.422]  Internet censorship of sites like InfoWars.
[02:38:30.482 --> 02:38:34.665]  Which we're going to play a clip of Trump and then go to Millie Weaver who will do this for several segments riding shotgun.
[02:38:34.945 --> 02:38:37.507]  She's in Cleveland at one of the big convention centers for a rally.
[02:38:39.042 --> 02:38:48.367]  There's a red wave, a populist wave, particularly with women worldwide who've been under socialism, who've been under communism, who've been under crony capitalism, who've been flooded by Islamic invasion.
[02:38:48.767 --> 02:38:52.489]  They're the ones, including socialist parties, who are joining with right-wingers.
[02:38:52.509 --> 02:38:55.371]  That's the secret combination, saying, we're sick of this crap.
[02:38:55.711 --> 02:38:57.612]  We remember the free market 20, 30 years ago.
[02:38:57.672 --> 02:38:58.233]  It's much better.
[02:38:58.653 --> 02:38:59.954]  We want to get out from under this.
[02:39:01.098 --> 02:39:07.600]  America may not have hurt enough yet, and been through the true socialist nightmare yet, to then wake up later.
[02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:20.543]  But see, the left knows that, so they're going to bring a real police state in if they get control, so the process in Europe and Brazil and everywhere else doesn't follow through, because these follow exact patterns, Roger.
[02:39:20.743 --> 02:39:25.704]  Let's play that clip, though, of the president saying he's getting ready to do antitrust and move against these people.
[02:39:25.744 --> 02:39:28.105]  But is it too little, too late?
[02:39:28.165 --> 02:39:28.525]  Here it is.
[02:39:29.753 --> 02:39:37.437]  We've talked about what's been happening on social media, a lot of people questioning whether or not these companies are getting too big, too fast, your Facebooks, your Amazons.
[02:39:37.717 --> 02:39:42.920]  Have you put thought into how Amazon and Facebook specifically should be regulated?
[02:39:43.321 --> 02:39:49.044]  You look at the European Union, they find, I guess it was Google, billions of dollars.
[02:39:49.984 --> 02:39:53.826]  And frankly, I don't like that they're doing that, because that's an American company.
[02:39:53.846 --> 02:39:55.347]  I don't think it's good that they're doing that.
[02:39:55.687 --> 02:39:58.029]  But if anybody does that, that should be us doing it.
[02:39:58.709 --> 02:40:00.592]  That shouldn't be the European Union.
[02:40:00.612 --> 02:40:01.974]  Do you think you regulate in the first term?
[02:40:02.214 --> 02:40:07.681]  You know, you get into the whole thing with freedom of speech and what do you think and... But what about monopoly?
[02:40:07.821 --> 02:40:09.884]  What about saying the Justice Department look into that?
[02:40:09.964 --> 02:40:14.290]  I have so many people saying that, but it's certainly something that we have looked at.
[02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:15.191]  Would you ever break them up?
[02:40:16.032 --> 02:40:17.414]  They were talking about this years ago.
[02:40:17.454 --> 02:40:24.460]  You know they were actually talking about this same subject monopoly years ago long before I was in office.
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:25.481]  You think you were the man to do it?
[02:40:25.501 --> 02:40:30.946]  In fact a lot of people thought it was going to happen and then I guess a previous administration stopped it from happening.
[02:40:30.966 --> 02:40:31.707]  You're in charge now?
[02:40:32.287 --> 02:40:32.888]  I am in charge.
[02:40:32.948 --> 02:40:35.530]  I am definitely in charge and we are certainly looking at it.
[02:40:35.550 --> 02:40:36.391]  This is antitrust?
[02:40:37.232 --> 02:40:37.913]  Antitrust, yes.
[02:40:37.933 --> 02:40:38.974]  For Amazon?
[02:40:39.654 --> 02:40:39.894]  For...
[02:40:41.047 --> 02:40:41.407]  All three.
[02:40:42.208 --> 02:40:45.171]  So we want to talk about what's been happening on social media.
[02:41:02.113 --> 02:41:02.614]  14?
[02:41:02.494 --> 02:41:02.614]  No, 15.
[02:41:03.634 --> 02:41:06.376]  No, 14 of the 20 fake lawsuits thrown out.
[02:41:06.677 --> 02:41:08.838]  But it's cost a lot of money and it's taken our time and energy.
[02:41:08.878 --> 02:41:13.161]  But thanks to you standing with us, enough money came in to deal with it so far.

[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:11.063]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[02:44:11.264 --> 02:44:12.364]  I'd done The War Room.
[02:44:12.664 --> 02:44:15.126]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[02:44:15.146 --> 02:44:16.707]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[02:44:16.747 --> 02:44:17.367]  I was exhausted.
[02:44:17.687 --> 02:44:20.969]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[02:44:21.309 --> 02:44:25.932]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[02:44:26.032 --> 02:44:28.053]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[02:44:28.193 --> 02:44:28.854]  Uh, the same thing.
[02:44:29.394 --> 02:44:30.855]  I'm having a full day here at InfoWars.
[02:44:30.955 --> 02:44:32.175]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[02:44:32.355 --> 02:44:34.437]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[02:44:34.477 --> 02:44:40.460]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:41.600]  You can sleep with it.
[02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:46.222]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[02:44:46.262 --> 02:44:49.064]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[02:44:49.224 --> 02:44:50.925]  This is the best combination I have found.
[02:44:50.945 --> 02:44:51.745]  It really works.
[02:44:51.965 --> 02:44:56.548]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[02:44:56.928 --> 02:44:59.069]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods, believe me.
[02:45:02.970 --> 02:45:10.734]  Hey, what happens if you try to order your favorite InfoWars Life product only to find out they're sold out?
[02:45:10.754 --> 02:45:14.716]  Yeah, I know it kind of sucks, but there is a solution.
[02:45:15.136 --> 02:45:20.059]  All you gotta do is go to InfoWarsStore.com and click on Auto Shift.
[02:45:20.139 --> 02:45:20.519]  Bam!
[02:45:20.759 --> 02:45:22.960]  Problem solved just like that.
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:26.062]  And now you're scheduled for regular delivery.
[02:45:26.222 --> 02:45:32.485]  That means no more back orders and you'll never run out of your favorite InfoWars Life products
[02:45:32.805 --> 02:45:33.185]  Again.
[02:45:33.545 --> 02:45:33.985]  Pretty cool.
[02:45:34.245 --> 02:45:34.846]  But guess what?
[02:45:35.146 --> 02:45:35.846]  It gets better.
[02:45:36.086 --> 02:45:43.928]  When you sign up for AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com, you get an additional 10% off that product.
[02:45:44.708 --> 02:45:45.068]  Woo!
[02:45:45.308 --> 02:45:46.309]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:45:46.329 --> 02:45:47.909]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:45:48.329 --> 02:45:50.029]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:45:50.570 --> 02:45:55.411]  Order and click on AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:46:00.412 --> 02:46:06.136]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[02:46:06.436 --> 02:46:10.458]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[02:46:10.898 --> 02:46:13.119]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[02:46:13.140 --> 02:46:15.261]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[02:46:15.601 --> 02:46:17.622]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[02:46:18.142 --> 02:46:18.382]  Boom!
[02:46:18.663 --> 02:46:20.924]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[02:46:21.264 --> 02:46:22.825]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[02:46:22.885 --> 02:46:24.706]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[02:46:24.766 --> 02:46:25.887]  You still have a shopfront.
[02:46:26.087 --> 02:46:26.847]  And then what do we see?
[02:46:27.147 --> 02:46:27.908]  Washington Post.
[02:46:28.448 --> 02:46:31.589]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%.
[02:46:32.949 --> 02:46:36.070]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[02:46:36.090 --> 02:46:38.911]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[02:46:39.231 --> 02:46:44.633]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:44.933 --> 02:46:51.935]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[02:46:52.275 --> 02:46:55.656]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships like CNN is.
[02:46:55.936 --> 02:47:00.138]  We're only funded by you, by getting the products at Infootballstore.com.
[02:47:04.701 --> 02:47:07.342]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:18.163 --> 02:47:26.604]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:45.242 --> 02:47:46.782]  Well, it's like deja vu.
[02:47:47.062 --> 02:47:54.544]  Here we are, one year and 364 days later, on the eve of what everybody agrees is the most important election in world history.
[02:47:55.364 --> 02:47:59.685]  Globalists have suffered defeats in over a hundred elections in the last six years.
[02:47:59.805 --> 02:48:08.227]  Brexit led the way to the American Rebellion, and what we saw two years ago with Trump, and now Trump and the American people delivering on what we said we would do.
[02:48:09.591 --> 02:48:10.352]  It's been stunning.
[02:48:10.892 --> 02:48:17.538]  And I played predictions that Roger and I made two years ago on election night about how Trump would be faithful, and he has been.
[02:48:18.179 --> 02:48:23.464]  Now he must be faithful on the censorship, and faithful on stopping the illegals voting, and faithful on the wall.
[02:48:23.484 --> 02:48:24.805]  But he's trying as best he can.
[02:48:24.845 --> 02:48:28.989]  But Roger, I cannot underestimate, as we go to Millie Weaver and then Owen Schroer,
[02:48:30.245 --> 02:48:31.326]  I cannot understate.
[02:48:31.887 --> 02:48:32.949]  It's not a power trip.
[02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:41.680]  I don't say that InfoWars, with you and all our guests, is writing the script for the American reboot, for the American resurgence.
[02:48:42.701 --> 02:48:48.588]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, Hillary Clinton, the UN, the Times of London, and internal documents we just got.
[02:48:49.289 --> 02:49:00.011]  From some of the biggest hedge funds and the CIA leftist groups on how they're planning to shut... We've gotten the documents, I'm letting them know, that are going to send them to prison!
[02:49:01.055 --> 02:49:05.077]  And it's just as we thought, how they were... We're fighting deep networks here, okay?
[02:49:05.597 --> 02:49:06.537]  Very, very deep networks.
[02:49:06.557 --> 02:49:12.700]  So when listeners tune in, you have to understand, we are literally like Luke... Infowars is like Luke Skywalker in the X-Wing.
[02:49:13.020 --> 02:49:14.741]  Other X-Wings are getting blown up all around us.
[02:49:15.041 --> 02:49:17.262]  We're the one that already blew the Death Star up.
[02:49:17.602 --> 02:49:19.123]  But there's a couple more Death Stars.
[02:49:19.583 --> 02:49:21.283]  We blew the Death Star up two years ago.
[02:49:21.343 --> 02:49:24.345]  They're coming after us with bounty hunters right now.
[02:49:24.365 --> 02:49:28.526]  And let me tell you, I would bow out at this point, except we haven't won the war yet.
[02:49:28.867 --> 02:49:29.367]  I want...
[02:49:29.867 --> 02:49:32.351]  To not be in the fight 18 hours a day.
[02:49:32.391 --> 02:49:35.916]  But Roger, we have to explain to listeners, we are the heart of the resistance.
[02:49:36.797 --> 02:49:38.900]  Matt Drudge understands it, he's the heart of the resistance too.
[02:49:39.241 --> 02:49:40.342]  We're all in this together.
[02:49:40.562 --> 02:49:41.444]  But listeners have to understand.
[02:49:42.819 --> 02:49:44.260]  This is a total war.
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:45.220]  This is real.
[02:49:45.300 --> 02:49:45.640]  Rogers?
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:49.021]  Alex, you couldn't have put it better yourself.
[02:49:49.321 --> 02:49:52.682]  They're trying to shut Infowars down because we are the tip of the spear.
[02:49:52.702 --> 02:49:53.823]  They're trying to put you in prison.
[02:49:53.883 --> 02:49:55.043]  They're trying to put me in jail.
[02:49:55.063 --> 02:49:57.044]  They may assassinate you before this is over.
[02:49:57.384 --> 02:50:01.125]  They need to snuff us because we have led the way for freedom.
[02:50:01.565 --> 02:50:01.866]  Tell them.
[02:50:01.926 --> 02:50:02.966]  Tell them the grand jury this week.
[02:50:03.686 --> 02:50:05.948]  They want to put you in prison and me in prison?
[02:50:05.988 --> 02:50:17.394]  Despite the fact that they have no evidence whatsoever of any crime on our part, you can read it at Vice or the Daily Beast or Newsweek or the New York Times for that matter.
[02:50:17.734 --> 02:50:18.634]  It's a witch hunt.
[02:50:19.015 --> 02:50:23.137]  There's no evidence that we ever got any information from Julian Assange.
[02:50:23.237 --> 02:50:26.699]  Everything we did was perfectly legal to win this election.
[02:50:27.019 --> 02:50:28.660]  But now they want to punish us.
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:29.040]  Why?
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:32.402]  I wrote the Clinton's War on Women and I talked about it here.
[02:50:32.742 --> 02:50:33.483]  On InfoWars.
[02:50:33.523 --> 02:50:37.806]  Because our listeners, with the truth and their intel, we are the winners.
[02:50:38.186 --> 02:50:39.167]  We are the warriors.
[02:50:39.267 --> 02:50:39.948]  We're the winners.
[02:50:40.188 --> 02:50:42.450]  Just like you'll have an NFL team like the Patriots that keep winning.
[02:50:42.850 --> 02:50:45.132]  They know we're just getting into our prime, man!
[02:50:45.412 --> 02:50:46.553]  They don't want to play us!
[02:50:47.414 --> 02:50:48.575]  We'll go to Owen Schroer in a moment.
[02:50:48.615 --> 02:50:49.776]  He is talking about kicking ass.
[02:50:50.016 --> 02:50:51.997]  Millie Weaver, you'll ride shotgun some of the next hour with me.
[02:50:52.017 --> 02:50:52.938]  I appreciate you holding there.
[02:50:53.378 --> 02:50:54.800]  Thankfully your Skype came back up.
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:51:00.124]  Tell us what you've seen on the road the last few months with the kick-butt job you and your team are doing.
[02:51:01.506 --> 02:51:16.373]  Well, we've just seen massive turnouts at these Donald Trump rallies and right now we're here in Cleveland, Ohio at the International Exposition Center where it looks like Trump finally picked a building that can house his massive crowds.
[02:51:17.013 --> 02:51:18.774]  This is a very big building here.
[02:51:19.414 --> 02:51:27.178]  I believe it's got an airport right next to it, which makes it a prime location since he's going to be stopping in at Cleveland, Ohio.
[02:51:27.298 --> 02:51:29.979]  I know his final destination is going to be in Missouri.
[02:51:30.039 --> 02:51:34.241]  He's going to have Sean Hannity and multiple other guests as well.
[02:51:34.801 --> 02:51:45.366]  Rush Limbaugh, that's right, appearing in his rally as kind of a final bang until the midterm elections happen tomorrow, which is when everyone is going to go out and vote.
[02:51:45.666 --> 02:51:47.728]  So far, people seem to be optimistic.
[02:51:47.768 --> 02:51:49.490]  They think that there's going to be a red wave.
[02:51:50.611 --> 02:52:02.121]  Most of them are not trusting the polls, given that last time, in 2016, the polls all said that Hillary Clinton was going to win by a landslide, and we know that Trump won by a landslide.
[02:52:02.502 --> 02:52:10.069]  So we're also here with Caitlin Bennett, who I'm going to pull in for a second here, and she's been talking to some of the protesters.
[02:52:11.710 --> 02:52:13.891]  Yeah, what do you think about some of the protesters?
[02:52:13.931 --> 02:52:15.332]  Was it a small blue puddle?
[02:52:15.752 --> 02:52:18.594]  Yeah, like I told Millie earlier, it was definitely a blue puddle.
[02:52:18.634 --> 02:52:20.515]  I don't know where they're getting this blue wave from.
[02:52:20.535 --> 02:52:22.376]  It's definitely not going to be anything like that.
[02:52:22.677 --> 02:52:28.820]  There's maybe only a dozen here compared to the thousands of Trump supporters and that's what we keep seeing at these Trump rallies.
[02:52:28.840 --> 02:52:33.203]  There's only a few protesters and there's thousands of supporters.
[02:52:34.064 --> 02:52:34.784]  Definitely.
[02:52:35.485 --> 02:52:43.015]  So far we've just seen that there haven't been as many protesters showing up to Trump's rallies lately as there had been in the past.
[02:52:43.456 --> 02:52:45.458]  It seems like they're taking a different approach.
[02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:48.701]  I don't know if you can hear us still out.
[02:52:48.821 --> 02:52:50.602]  Oh yes, there's a baby in the night.
[02:52:51.423 --> 02:52:52.263]  There's a woman in the night.
[02:52:52.283 --> 02:52:53.304]  She's got a baby in her arms.
[02:52:53.764 --> 02:52:54.985]  I'm gonna come right back to you in a moment.
[02:52:55.065 --> 02:52:55.745]  Owen's popping in.
[02:52:55.765 --> 02:52:57.146]  We'll continue with you ladies here in just a moment.
[02:52:57.486 --> 02:52:59.747]  Owen Schroyer is about to hit the third dimension.
[02:53:00.147 --> 02:53:07.631]  He's about to give the secret location of where that demonstration to take over some I-35 signs are here in Austin, Texas.
[02:53:07.651 --> 02:53:08.672]  So Owen, tell us about that.
[02:53:09.298 --> 02:53:10.118]  That's right, Alex.
[02:53:10.198 --> 02:53:15.380]  The InfoWars Army, some people here in Texas, they're traveling from San Antonio, Dallas, Houston.
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:16.240]  They're all going to be here.
[02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:17.540]  I'm really excited to meet them.
[02:53:17.781 --> 02:53:21.502]  We're holding signs on the Riverside Bridge over Highway 35.
[02:53:22.522 --> 02:53:24.142]  Now, I've got about 12 signs.
[02:53:24.263 --> 02:53:25.583]  One of them is right here behind me.
[02:53:25.803 --> 02:53:27.383]  Vote Red, Vote Dem Out.
[02:53:27.764 --> 02:53:30.684]  I've got, I think, 12 signs, so you don't need to bring a sign.
[02:53:30.724 --> 02:53:31.885]  I've got a big sign for you.
[02:53:32.225 --> 02:53:33.305]  Or you can bring your own sign.
[02:53:33.365 --> 02:53:35.086]  People bring flags and all kinds of stuff.
[02:53:35.406 --> 02:53:38.767]  And again, the idea is for photo op to trigger a chain reaction.
[02:53:39.307 --> 02:53:43.170]  Plus there's going to be, we'll probably get at least 10,000 eyes on these signs.
[02:53:43.551 --> 02:53:46.333]  Highway 35 is the biggest highway in Austin, Texas.
[02:53:46.433 --> 02:53:50.996]  And you announced the location last minute so Antifund don't come out and try to stop the person.
[02:53:51.016 --> 02:53:53.518]  That's the Riverside Bridge on I-35.
[02:53:53.558 --> 02:53:54.199]  You can't miss it.
[02:53:54.219 --> 02:53:55.240]  Plenty of parking around there.
[02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:56.120]  That's right.
[02:53:56.160 --> 02:53:59.263]  So Riverside Bridge, I-35, I'm going to be there at 5 o'clock.
[02:53:59.383 --> 02:54:00.904]  Meet me there at 5 o'clock.
[02:54:00.924 --> 02:54:01.945]  We're going to be there for an hour.
[02:54:02.005 --> 02:54:02.805]  It's rush hour.
[02:54:03.245 --> 02:54:09.410]  And I'm expecting maybe, I know some leftists have been trying to get this intel out of me for a while, so they're probably going to tune in.
[02:54:09.430 --> 02:54:10.190]  We'll see if they show up.
[02:54:10.210 --> 02:54:11.631]  But hey, I invite them to join me.
[02:54:12.072 --> 02:54:12.852]  I invite them to join me.
[02:54:12.892 --> 02:54:13.413]  Come join.
[02:54:13.453 --> 02:54:14.633]  We're anti-fascist too.
[02:54:14.673 --> 02:54:17.696]  We don't like the fascism at Google and Apple and YouTube and all of that.
[02:54:17.736 --> 02:54:19.177]  So we're anti-fascist.
[02:54:19.417 --> 02:54:20.518]  They're anti-fascist.
[02:54:20.538 --> 02:54:22.359]  So maybe they can actually join us this time.
[02:54:22.699 --> 02:54:24.920]  We're going to have live coverage all the way up to midnight tonight.
[02:54:24.940 --> 02:54:28.861]  The War Room, you and Roger Stone and so many other big guests that I shouldn't be mentioning who's coming up today.
[02:54:28.901 --> 02:54:29.542]  There are so many.
[02:54:29.782 --> 02:54:32.483]  We already had Ted Nugent on, Mike Adams.
[02:54:32.843 --> 02:54:34.404]  We're going to have Owen Benjamin.
[02:54:34.724 --> 02:54:35.864]  We're going to have Mike Cernovich.
[02:54:35.884 --> 02:54:37.105]  We're going to have Matt Bracken.
[02:54:37.125 --> 02:54:39.446]  I want to get Will Johnson on and so many more.
[02:54:39.466 --> 02:54:42.247]  And then tomorrow, more than 24-hour live coverage, 8 a.m.
[02:54:42.287 --> 02:54:45.428]  right through to the next day at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:54:45.928 --> 02:54:50.229]  And at Infowars.com, there's a page always up there on the front page that says, watch the live coverage.
[02:54:50.269 --> 02:54:51.169]  That's the link to share.
[02:54:51.589 --> 02:54:54.790]  Oh, and five o'clock today, Riverside in Austin, Texas.
[02:54:54.810 --> 02:54:56.370]  You'll have big giant signs for folks.
[02:54:56.690 --> 02:54:59.011]  Everybody come out there, videotape it, live stream it.
[02:54:59.291 --> 02:55:00.111]  You are the resistance.
[02:55:00.151 --> 02:55:00.651]  Great job.
[02:55:00.691 --> 02:55:02.932]  Going back to Millie Weaver there.
[02:55:03.612 --> 02:55:05.272]  Millie, what does your gut level tell you?
[02:55:05.432 --> 02:55:09.133]  I think Trump revolution continues because he delivered on the economy.
[02:55:10.131 --> 02:55:17.040]  But my concern, Millie, is that there's so much fraud, so much censorship, so much intimidation that they're going to try to steal the election.
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:17.561]  What do you think?
[02:55:19.864 --> 02:55:22.988]  You know, I think it's probably going to be close.
[02:55:25.096 --> 02:55:26.377]  And again, Millie, you're awesome.
[02:55:26.397 --> 02:55:32.320]  We're going to let her go, because that's why I didn't go to her earlier, because the Skype, there's so many tens of thousands, they're already getting there early for Trump.
[02:55:32.561 --> 02:55:34.122]  They're sapping all the internet strength.
[02:55:34.602 --> 02:55:40.546]  So maybe if she can get to another location, we'll go back to her and Caitlin Bennett doing an absolutely kick-butt job.
[02:55:41.066 --> 02:55:41.947]  I want to hear her prediction.
[02:55:41.967 --> 02:55:42.787]  And I'm not hedging bets.
[02:55:42.827 --> 02:55:44.188]  Last year I said absolutely winning.
[02:55:44.528 --> 02:55:45.149]  You watch, do it.
[02:55:45.189 --> 02:55:45.969]  It was my gut level.
[02:55:46.089 --> 02:55:46.510]  I knew it.
[02:55:46.830 --> 02:55:48.331]  In fact, I'm not even into fancy things.
[02:55:49.892 --> 02:55:50.973]  People bought me watches.
[02:55:52.614 --> 02:55:56.638]  And I actually went out and bought my dad a really nice watch the day before the election.
[02:55:56.658 --> 02:56:00.481]  And I said, I'm giving you this watch to signify the victory and the resurgence of America.
[02:56:00.801 --> 02:56:02.002]  He said, do you really think he's going to win?
[02:56:02.022 --> 02:56:03.183]  I said, you absolutely watch.
[02:56:03.323 --> 02:56:03.944]  I know he is.
[02:56:04.424 --> 02:56:05.985]  Right now, my gut's never wrong.
[02:56:06.266 --> 02:56:08.147]  I feel like it's undecided.
[02:56:08.207 --> 02:56:09.869]  I think it's going to be a very close race.
[02:56:10.069 --> 02:56:11.010]  I don't think this is decided.
[02:56:11.830 --> 02:56:12.751]  Alex, I agree with you.
[02:56:12.811 --> 02:56:16.312]  And again, I think if we got an honest count, this wouldn't even be in doubt.
[02:56:16.913 --> 02:56:20.014]  We're facing multiple obstacles we didn't have in 2016.
[02:56:20.555 --> 02:56:21.675]  They were overconfident.
[02:56:21.835 --> 02:56:27.398]  In all honesty, if Hillary Clinton had bothered to show up in Michigan or Wisconsin, she might have won.
[02:56:27.458 --> 02:56:28.138]  Or Pennsylvania.
[02:56:28.218 --> 02:56:28.879]  Or Pennsylvania.
[02:56:28.919 --> 02:56:30.339]  But she took those for granted.
[02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:34.562]  She got outworked and outfoxed by Donald Trump and the Trump campaign.
[02:56:34.922 --> 02:56:40.124]  Frankly, the emergence of Danny Williams, Bill's abandoned son, made a real difference.
[02:56:40.144 --> 02:56:41.285]  By the way, you're not just saying that.
[02:56:41.505 --> 02:56:42.646]  They got 37 million views.
[02:56:42.686 --> 02:56:44.187]  That's the real reason they want to put you in jail.
[02:56:44.287 --> 02:56:44.507]  Yes.
[02:56:44.647 --> 02:56:46.008]  InfoWars helped push it over the top.
[02:56:46.068 --> 02:56:46.988]  I'm very proud of the audience.
[02:56:47.248 --> 02:56:56.433]  And now Fox polls, Rasmussen polls and others, even CNN polls show 30% support, 40% support, 42% support for Trump.
[02:56:56.753 --> 02:56:59.215]  The previous record was 13% for Ronald Reagan.
[02:56:59.735 --> 02:57:03.317]  Black folks, God love them, like everybody else, are waking up, man.
[02:57:03.477 --> 02:57:04.417]  They like jobs.
[02:57:04.798 --> 02:57:06.038]  They like opportunity.
[02:57:06.258 --> 02:57:08.019]  They like a prosperous future.
[02:57:08.139 --> 02:57:10.661]  So the president has made real inroads.
[02:57:11.261 --> 02:57:19.126]  Sure they're incremental, but a shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Detroit shifted that state, Michigan, to Donald Trump.
[02:57:19.427 --> 02:57:26.131]  And I remember you said target everything on Michigan, you were doing Detroit radio, we were pumping ads in there with Danny Williams.
[02:57:26.491 --> 02:57:28.613]  Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania.
[02:57:28.733 --> 02:57:29.754]  There it is right there.
[02:57:29.854 --> 02:57:32.075]  And that's where we focused that effort.
[02:57:32.255 --> 02:57:35.818]  38 million people saw that video, 8 million of them saw it through InfoWars.
[02:57:37.364 --> 02:57:39.367]  That's why they want to destroy us and put us in jail.
[02:57:39.668 --> 02:57:41.631]  Because folks, we're not going to flinch our back down.
[02:57:42.051 --> 02:57:44.254]  They want to ram heads, they want to play chicken, we're doing it.
[02:57:44.595 --> 02:57:49.803]  But your prayers and support gives us more jet fuel to make sure when we make that connection, it is destructive.
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:56.241]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:57:56.721 --> 02:58:05.623]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:58:06.183 --> 02:58:10.744]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:59:55.936 --> 02:59:59.639]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.879 --> 03:00:36.479]  All right, Roger.
[03:00:36.499 --> 03:00:39.300]  I want to go back to the subject we were talking about at the start of the last hour.
[03:00:39.740 --> 03:00:42.681]  The amazing video of Axios kind of dragging out Trump.
[03:00:42.721 --> 03:00:43.841]  Well, what are you going to do to big tech?
[03:00:43.861 --> 03:00:44.921]  What are you going to do to Amazon?
[03:00:45.381 --> 03:00:48.262]  And then he finally says, look, it should have been done before.
[03:00:48.802 --> 03:00:52.403]  We shouldn't have the EU coming in and doing regulations to our companies.
[03:00:52.883 --> 03:00:55.844]  That's basically allowing a foreign power to control us.
[03:00:57.204 --> 03:00:58.325]  We need to go after these folks.
[03:00:58.365 --> 03:00:59.365]  I don't want to hurt the companies.
[03:00:59.405 --> 03:01:00.785]  I don't want to hurt America.
[03:01:00.825 --> 03:01:02.386]  But they can't meddle in elections.
[03:01:02.406 --> 03:01:03.126]  They can't do all this.
[03:01:03.926 --> 03:01:05.466]  Why do you think he's only doing it now?
[03:01:05.527 --> 03:01:10.908]  Because it's a popular issue, it's the right thing to do, it's one of the few areas that I think the President's dropped the ball.
[03:01:11.388 --> 03:01:12.088]  I'd say two things.
[03:01:12.208 --> 03:01:22.371]  One thing, what I really liked about that interview, Alex, was the fact that the President said, always looking at the bottom line for America, if anybody's going to be fining these companies, it ought to be us.
[03:01:22.751 --> 03:01:24.492]  You see, that's for the taxpayers.
[03:01:24.812 --> 03:01:25.992]  That's for the bottom line.
[03:01:26.012 --> 03:01:27.813]  That's why you have a businessman as President.
[03:01:28.553 --> 03:01:35.940]  In all honesty, my guess is the President has probably urged his Justice Department to look into this and they have done nothing because they're for the status quo.
[03:01:36.801 --> 03:01:40.805]  The President has to get control of his Justice Department after this election.
[03:01:41.085 --> 03:01:43.327]  He needs to fire Sessions and clean house.
[03:01:43.647 --> 03:01:50.714]  If he does not do that, whether it is illegal immigration or election fraud or internet censorship, the country will not survive.
[03:01:50.794 --> 03:01:54.397]  Because if they get away with all this incredible unprecedented stuff, they're going to go even crazier.
[03:01:54.437 --> 03:02:07.569]  And again, when I had that report written by antitrust lawyers, three different law firms, you worked on it, we paid to have it done, we got it delivered to Trump, that's when they started censoring me off the web and accelerating, because Big Tech is actually spying on everybody.
[03:02:07.909 --> 03:02:10.431]  They got so angry, but I knew to put up front
[03:02:11.172 --> 03:02:16.719]  Trump gets it's not right to have foreign powers, A, regulating us, and then B, doing multi-billion dollar fines.
[03:02:17.060 --> 03:02:20.424]  I said, sir, it's time for you to do this, but for real reasons.
[03:02:20.464 --> 03:02:27.614]  Instead, you're letting them bring regulatory control over us, and they want censorship to stop the fines.
[03:02:28.815 --> 03:02:31.759]  We will start fines if they engage in censorship.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:36.446]  And I think just the total common sense of that, from what I was told, absolutely.
[03:02:36.506 --> 03:02:37.788]  I mean, I am bragging here.
[03:02:38.148 --> 03:02:38.989]  We took action.
[03:02:39.029 --> 03:02:39.871]  We busted ass.
[03:02:40.291 --> 03:02:45.378]  I got sanctioned for it, but it's well worth it when big tech gets a broomstick shoved up its rear end.
[03:02:46.399 --> 03:02:47.900]  Alex, I hope that you're right.
[03:02:48.100 --> 03:02:53.142]  I mean, in all honesty, the Democrats cheated in every way possible in 2016.
[03:02:53.682 --> 03:03:01.025]  You had state surveillance of the Republican candidate for president, with no probable cause, because he was in touch with the Russians.
[03:03:01.085 --> 03:03:03.886]  That's invented, contrived nonsense.
[03:03:04.366 --> 03:03:08.908]  So, they cheated, a crime far worse than Watergate, and they still couldn't win.
[03:03:09.608 --> 03:03:13.891]  There's a Republican majority in the country now, if we can get an honest count.
[03:03:14.291 --> 03:03:29.681]  But between widespread voter fraud, illegal immigration and the voting of illegals, and this net-based censorship of which InfoWars has been the main focus because we are the most audacious and we are the most outrageous.
[03:03:29.701 --> 03:03:33.263]  Trump should have pulled the trigger when he had absolutely everything assured.
[03:03:33.543 --> 03:03:35.464]  He should have released the class... Here's where he messed up.
[03:03:35.764 --> 03:03:36.864]  Should have gone after the censorship.
[03:03:37.144 --> 03:03:38.865]  Should have gone for the illegal voting earlier.
[03:03:38.885 --> 03:03:45.128]  He's not all powerful and should have, you know, pulled the trigger on releasing the classified data that showed they were spying on him.
[03:03:45.208 --> 03:03:47.029]  And it all boils right back to where?
[03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:48.811]  The Justice Department.
[03:03:49.011 --> 03:03:51.733]  Who talked him out of declassifying those documents?
[03:03:52.133 --> 03:03:53.054]  Rod Rosenstein.
[03:03:53.834 --> 03:04:02.201]  Those documents are central because the readers from the British and the Australians have weighed in and said, oh please don't declassify these.
[03:04:02.601 --> 03:04:04.542]  They would expose our sources and methods.
[03:04:04.623 --> 03:04:10.347]  No, what they'll expose is the British and the Australians were complicit in the spying on Donald Trump.
[03:04:10.747 --> 03:04:11.788]  It is that simple.
[03:04:12.208 --> 03:04:19.430]  So, they cheated using an abuse of power, the use of the authority and the capability of the state to spy on the Trump campaign.
[03:04:19.450 --> 03:04:20.090]  And it's confirmed!
[03:04:20.970 --> 03:04:37.035]  And you're the one that said on January 20th of last year, in front of the whole world, you're the one that said all of this, the key is the FISA court, the key is the illegal spying, and you're right, and now Trump is doing it, but how did they convince him to not release it?
[03:04:37.835 --> 03:04:43.621]  They convinced him that it would upset our allies and it would expose our methods and sources, which is nonsense.
[03:04:44.001 --> 03:04:48.045]  What it will expose is the criminality of the Obama Justice Department.
[03:05:02.298 --> 03:05:11.581]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:05:11.621 --> 03:05:13.902]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:05:14.502 --> 03:05:20.584]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:05:21.244 --> 03:05:27.087]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:05:27.527 --> 03:05:33.150]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:05:33.850 --> 03:05:40.854]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:05:40.934 --> 03:05:41.134]  But!
[03:05:41.974 --> 03:05:54.525]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:05:55.046 --> 03:05:58.829]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:05:59.329 --> 03:06:02.032]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:06:03.032 --> 03:06:03.613]  We've got it.
[03:06:03.653 --> 03:06:10.078]  This transmission is coming to you.
[03:06:10.158 --> 03:06:12.280]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:14.562 --> 03:06:20.187]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:25.384 --> 03:06:27.088]  We're good to go.
[03:06:38.289 --> 03:06:55.057]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the election headquarters for real information, for real analysis is Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Stonecoldtruth.com, and of course, ladies and gentlemen, Gerald Salente's websites, TrendsResearch.com.
[03:06:55.877 --> 03:06:59.079]  You absolutely need to go there to find out the latest.
[03:06:59.659 --> 03:07:01.019]  We've had so many great guests on.
[03:07:01.079 --> 03:07:04.500]  Ted Nugent, Brandon Darby, Millie Weaver, Owen Schroer.
[03:07:04.540 --> 03:07:09.362]  We're going until midnight tonight, and then we're back tomorrow for over 24 hours live broadcast.
[03:07:09.382 --> 03:07:10.442]  I wanted to bring Celente in.
[03:07:10.462 --> 03:07:20.765]  He's going to be taking over the hour, but for this hour it's a roundtable with myself and Roger Stone to A, get his gut-level prediction for tomorrow, and then my question and Roger's question to get your angle on it.
[03:07:21.565 --> 03:07:39.416]  Regardless of who wins tomorrow, the fact that Trump didn't go after the censorship more, he gave some whip service, which is better than nothing, and the fact that they didn't stop the illegals voting, and the fact that they allowed all this Chinese foreign meddling, which was public in the election, really is scary to me and I think they've dropped the ball.
[03:07:39.456 --> 03:07:46.740]  Forget red waves, blue waves, we've seen a un-American censorship wave, which Trump says he's preparing to go after, but why after the election?
[03:07:46.800 --> 03:07:50.943]  And Trump letting the Justice Department run all over him and the American people,
[03:07:52.110 --> 03:07:53.131]  We're good to go.
[03:08:07.681 --> 03:08:14.606]  Uh, at, at Assange On Air, sending him mean emails, Roger doing it, saying, why are you giving the New York Times interviews and not us?
[03:08:15.286 --> 03:08:20.150]  They had said that the WikiLeaks, uh, was going to hurt Hillary and Podesta on the news.
[03:08:20.650 --> 03:08:25.574]  Then we said that, we hyped it up because it was important, and now he's facing prison.
[03:08:26.434 --> 03:08:29.796]  You said the grand jury, reportedly they're constantly asking about me.
[03:08:30.017 --> 03:08:36.461]  They want to know, did Alex Jones know whether Roger Stone got allegedly hacked emails from WikiLeaks?
[03:08:36.521 --> 03:08:40.063]  Well the answer is no, because I received no such thing.
[03:08:40.764 --> 03:08:48.049]  It's a witch hunt, but you're looking at two of the prime suspects in the victory of the 2016 election, and that's what this is about.
[03:08:48.089 --> 03:08:50.470]  And you don't have to believe us!
[03:08:51.051 --> 03:08:52.412]  Here's a prime example, Donald Trump Jr.
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:54.460]  Last year.
[03:08:55.421 --> 03:08:58.543]  And then this year again, they go, oh, national news, Donald Trump Jr.
[03:08:59.043 --> 03:09:03.446]  He had the code keys to WikiLeaks and sent them to his dad and said, oh, look, here's the WikiLeaks.
[03:09:03.486 --> 03:09:03.986]  Look at this.
[03:09:04.406 --> 03:09:06.707]  It was almost two months after it was public.
[03:09:07.088 --> 03:09:09.029]  I'm actually sad that Don Jr.
[03:09:09.089 --> 03:09:11.430]  took, you know, almost 60 days.
[03:09:11.670 --> 03:09:14.592]  The craziness is we were following what Assange said.
[03:09:14.732 --> 03:09:17.294]  Anyone can go back to the news articles at the time.
[03:09:17.334 --> 03:09:18.835]  So what's the word on the grand jury?
[03:09:18.855 --> 03:09:21.276]  I know you've had exculpatory witnesses there.
[03:09:21.576 --> 03:09:22.917]  What do they say when they see this?
[03:09:23.197 --> 03:09:27.280]  No, it's hard to say because grand juries are easy to mislead.
[03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:47.034]  We know that they heard from an exculpatory witness who testified that Randy Credico confirmed to him, to his face, and in a text message, that he was the one who tipped me that whatever Assange said he had, which he announced on CNN in June and Fox in August on Hillary Clinton, was big.
[03:09:47.294 --> 03:09:49.035]  That it would cost her the election.
[03:09:49.395 --> 03:09:50.716]  It was a bombshell.
[03:09:51.137 --> 03:09:51.937]  Devastating.
[03:09:52.298 --> 03:09:52.658]  Coming.
[03:09:53.458 --> 03:09:57.702]  And he reiterated this all through September, and he was right.
[03:09:57.922 --> 03:09:59.203]  Everything he told me was right.
[03:09:59.244 --> 03:10:01.706]  But there's no inside information here.
[03:10:02.206 --> 03:10:10.493]  Instead of listening to that exculpatory witness, they now seem to be wrapping them around the idea that I tried to intimidate or
[03:10:12.335 --> 03:10:13.275]  Pressure Kredico.
[03:10:13.755 --> 03:10:15.616]  I was very angry at Kredico.
[03:10:16.036 --> 03:10:21.357]  Not because he wouldn't lie, but because he refuses, even to this day, to tell the truth.
[03:10:21.858 --> 03:10:27.719]  To the extent that I was angry with him, it was over his refusal to fess up about what he really did.
[03:10:28.119 --> 03:10:29.340]  He was my source.
[03:10:29.720 --> 03:10:31.860]  If you force me to prove it, I can.
[03:10:32.761 --> 03:10:37.022]  Alex Jones has no knowledge of us receiving anything from WikiLeaks.
[03:10:37.162 --> 03:10:39.742]  Other than me squeezing you saying, can't you get through to them?
[03:10:39.762 --> 03:10:41.703]  You said, no, I know one guy that talks to him.
[03:10:41.983 --> 03:10:45.744]  Yeah, I mean, we just, you know, we took what was publicly available information.
[03:10:45.764 --> 03:10:46.464]  We're going to get to it more.
[03:10:46.504 --> 03:10:47.644]  You're hosting for three hours coming up.
[03:10:47.664 --> 03:10:49.644]  I just wanted to get, Gerald Slinda, you're taking over.
[03:10:49.704 --> 03:10:50.244]  God love you.
[03:10:50.464 --> 03:10:51.465]  FriendsResearch.com.
[03:10:51.485 --> 03:10:52.565]  What do you make of all this?
[03:10:52.805 --> 03:10:53.785]  What do you predict tomorrow?
[03:10:54.905 --> 03:11:07.327]  Well, the big thing that I see that I never saw before, and you guys have been around a long time as well, is to get out to vote movement, particularly as being funded by the Democrats.
[03:11:08.168 --> 03:11:10.468]  And when you're looking at the data coming in,
[03:11:11.627 --> 03:11:15.368]  Early voting tallies continue to surge.
[03:11:16.549 --> 03:11:17.769]  At historic rates.
[03:11:17.789 --> 03:11:23.092]  This is from the Wall Street Journal this weekend, according to public available information.
[03:11:24.052 --> 03:11:30.654]  As of Sunday, more than 34 million people have voted in the 2018 midterms.
[03:11:31.335 --> 03:11:39.658]  Further evidence that the election will significantly outpace turnout in previous elections at midterm time.
[03:11:40.385 --> 03:11:41.766]  So that's the big one.
[03:11:42.187 --> 03:11:51.694]  That's the unknown right now, because a lot of these also new people that they're getting out to vote are younger people.
[03:11:52.415 --> 03:11:58.439]  And when we look at the election in Georgia, for example, the majority of the people voting are women.
[03:11:59.340 --> 03:12:02.703]  So the outcome is is really up in the air.
[03:12:02.763 --> 03:12:06.586]  But we're standing with what most are saying right now.
[03:12:07.188 --> 03:12:14.270]  And that is that the House will go Democratic and the Senate may stay Republican.
[03:12:14.951 --> 03:12:36.458]  One of the shortcomings, and it's noted in the media as well, whether it's the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, is that what Trump has failed to do, not only in terms of the censorship issue, which is really above most people's concern, they're not really concerned that much with it, the average voter,
[03:12:37.108 --> 03:12:38.929]  It's the economy, stupid!
[03:12:50.743 --> 03:13:03.451]  So that was the one failure that we see, that although he keeps bringing it up from time to time, too many distractions and not enough on that, because it's basically a pocketbook issue.
[03:13:03.972 --> 03:13:06.594]  And those are the main issues right now.
[03:13:07.114 --> 03:13:11.217]  And the divided states of America has pushed it to other issues.
[03:13:11.657 --> 03:13:16.140]  And in talking about the Russian hacking into America's election,
[03:13:16.923 --> 03:13:18.404]  Let's suppose they did.
[03:13:18.845 --> 03:13:24.750]  And of course we know, as do your listeners, that there's not one shred of evidence that they did.
[03:13:25.150 --> 03:13:29.054]  It's our assumption, it's our conclusion, it's our BS that they did.
[03:13:29.354 --> 03:13:30.836]  But suppose they did.
[03:13:32.037 --> 03:13:36.320]  What was the information that these terrible hackers brought out?
[03:13:37.021 --> 03:13:41.185]  What a criminal operation the Clinton administration
[03:13:42.006 --> 03:13:43.167]  Is and was.
[03:13:43.767 --> 03:13:49.649]  And the payoffs that they've gotten for doing all the dirty deeds of robbing Americans.
[03:13:49.709 --> 03:13:50.429]  No, but you're right.
[03:13:50.449 --> 03:13:52.530]  But you gotta hand it to them how they changed the subject.
[03:13:53.450 --> 03:13:54.171]  Exactly.
[03:13:54.511 --> 03:13:56.091]  And that's what the issue is.
[03:13:56.431 --> 03:14:02.814]  That they're getting... You can hear Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton BS for free all day long.
[03:14:03.154 --> 03:14:06.115]  You don't have to pay them $300,000 an hour from the Goldman Sachs gang.
[03:14:09.948 --> 03:14:19.779]  Why do you think the major networks are so anti-Republican and so anti-Alex Jones?
[03:14:20.239 --> 03:14:29.910]  Because Bill Clinton sold us out with the Federal Communications Act of 1996 that allowed five companies to control
[03:14:31.598 --> 03:14:32.859]  90% of the media.
[03:14:33.059 --> 03:14:34.420]  It's called payback.
[03:14:34.801 --> 03:14:36.322]  They got paid back.
[03:14:36.762 --> 03:14:41.065]  That should have been the issue rather than, I don't know, the Russians.
[03:14:41.125 --> 03:14:42.066]  The Russians are coming.
[03:14:42.086 --> 03:14:43.087]  The Russians are coming.
[03:14:43.587 --> 03:14:45.589]  So the major issue has been lost.
[03:14:45.629 --> 03:14:48.611]  And by the way, as you know, I'm a political atheist.
[03:14:49.091 --> 03:14:53.274]  I don't like either the blunts or the crips or the Republicans or the Democrats.
[03:14:53.915 --> 03:14:57.517]  So Twitter deleted more than 10,000 accounts that
[03:15:00.009 --> 03:15:00.550]  Yeah, right.
[03:15:14.548 --> 03:15:18.032]  You're not allowed to have a different opinion anymore in America.
[03:15:18.432 --> 03:15:19.974]  It's a total take-off.
[03:15:20.094 --> 03:15:20.694]  No, no, I agree.
[03:15:20.734 --> 03:15:21.415]  The story's real.
[03:15:21.435 --> 03:15:22.436]  You're right, they did that.
[03:15:22.897 --> 03:15:28.242]  And I've just experienced where they claim, oh, Jones is fake news, or Jones says he hates Jews.
[03:15:28.502 --> 03:15:29.804]  They just lie about the reason, too.
[03:15:29.844 --> 03:15:33.908]  But I get on its face, they're saying, wait, you're not allowed to say voting's illegal?
[03:15:34.248 --> 03:15:35.329]  In many cases, it's a fraud.
[03:15:35.629 --> 03:15:36.129]  Great points.
[03:15:36.149 --> 03:15:37.709]  Gerald Cilente, you're taking over right now.
[03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:39.350]  FriendsResearch.com.
[03:15:39.750 --> 03:15:44.892]  And then coming up in 45 minutes, The War Room with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone, loaded for bear.
[03:15:45.212 --> 03:15:51.515]  And I'm going to be up here all night long till midnight with a bunch of hosts, a bunch of clips, a bunch of breaking news.
[03:15:52.395 --> 03:15:53.155]  It's all coming up.
[03:15:53.576 --> 03:15:54.776]  And how do you get past the censors?
[03:15:54.796 --> 03:15:56.517]  How do you really piss the globalists off?
[03:15:56.917 --> 03:15:59.318]  Go to InfoWars.com and share those live links to the show.
[03:16:04.867 --> 03:16:07.128]  An energized quantum state.
[03:16:08.549 --> 03:16:10.970]  Or an energized atomic state.
[03:16:11.790 --> 03:16:12.410]  What does that mean?
[03:16:13.531 --> 03:16:14.891]  It means it's pure.
[03:16:15.832 --> 03:16:23.015]  And it means the properties of what it does in the body, in interaction with other properties, is pure.
[03:16:23.835 --> 03:16:25.356]  Is unadulterated.
[03:16:25.456 --> 03:16:26.076]  Is original.
[03:16:26.276 --> 03:16:27.437]  Is first generation.
[03:16:29.025 --> 03:16:40.116]  This has been quite a quest for Info Wars when we discovered that there's a whole UN world government plan to remove even crappy forms of iodine out of food so that people can't absorb it.
[03:16:40.156 --> 03:16:45.861]  When I say crappy forms, I mean types that are bound to other elements so your body doesn't get absorption.
[03:16:46.662 --> 03:16:52.348]  This is an essential element in the body, just like vitamin C, just like oxygen, just like water.
[03:16:53.510 --> 03:17:07.113]  At first, doing research, we got the best seaweed base, but it was still weak, and we had issues with supply, and then leftists found out six years ago that we were involved, that it was Infowars, so they cut us off.
[03:17:07.853 --> 03:17:15.934]  And then we came into X2 that was from oil and gas drilling at about 7,000 to 12,000 feet, getting pure crystals for truly pure iodine.
[03:17:16.094 --> 03:17:18.755]  We had to go through the DEA to get it, all these controls.
[03:17:20.026 --> 03:17:24.417]  The old companies caught on that we were getting it, and they try to jack up prices and cause us problems.
[03:17:24.437 --> 03:17:27.685]  And I didn't want to raise prices, so I cut my contract off with them.
[03:17:28.818 --> 03:17:36.403]  And we went out and did a huge industry research and found out we could get the same deep earth crystals, probably even purer.
[03:17:36.483 --> 03:17:38.845]  You're talking about like 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, you know, percent pure.
[03:17:40.186 --> 03:17:47.391]  And then the chemists and others explained to us that you need other types of basic iodine to make sure it gets fully absorbed.
[03:17:47.431 --> 03:17:49.873]  So this has all three types of iodine.
[03:17:51.082 --> 03:18:00.586]  And then it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that doesn't let it oxidize and basically keeps it in its energetic state, or its quantum state, its atomic state.
[03:18:00.806 --> 03:18:07.349]  And again, atomic doesn't mean radioactive, that just means it's pure on the periodic table.
[03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:08.270]  This is X3.
[03:18:08.830 --> 03:18:10.131]  I am so excited about X3.
[03:18:12.148 --> 03:18:17.569]  So that out of the gate, we're bringing it to you at 50% off in the 1 ounce and 2 ounce bottles.
[03:18:18.150 --> 03:18:19.690]  Now we didn't have X2 in a 2 ounce bottle.
[03:18:19.710 --> 03:18:22.251]  We do for X3 so you can stock up on it.
[03:18:23.811 --> 03:18:26.952]  It really is beyond game changing.
[03:18:27.332 --> 03:18:28.713]  It's essential.
[03:18:29.893 --> 03:18:36.035]  Survival Shield X3, nascent tri-iodine in 2 ounce and in 1 ounce bottles.
[03:18:36.575 --> 03:18:41.236]  And you don't just get a key element that's essential to human life on this planet.
[03:18:42.517 --> 03:18:47.061]  You also funded operations promoting the First Amendment, Second Amendment, the whole nine yards.
[03:18:47.362 --> 03:19:00.274]  I mean, quite frankly, I've got all these scientific documents and all these notes from chemists and all these facts, but I'm just going to tell the viewers, just like our information has changed the world, just like it pisses the establishment off, anything I'm going to bring you is the very best.
[03:19:01.074 --> 03:19:02.115]  It's like any of our products.
[03:19:02.235 --> 03:19:03.875]  I'm like, what is the top product?
[03:19:03.955 --> 03:19:04.936]  What is the best tested?
[03:19:05.236 --> 03:19:06.536]  What is absolutely highest rated?
[03:19:07.057 --> 03:19:11.178]  I want to put a formula out stronger and better and lower the price.
[03:19:11.838 --> 03:19:12.919]  We're always innovating.
[03:19:12.959 --> 03:19:13.979]  We're always researching.
[03:19:14.600 --> 03:19:24.924]  But quite frankly, it's been oppression and it's been people trying to block our supply chain that made us go out and really do the hard work to discover what is the very best documented form of iodine.
[03:19:25.544 --> 03:19:31.205]  And it's all three types fused together, energized by a small amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it.
[03:19:32.266 --> 03:19:35.647]  Three forms of iodine is better than one.
[03:19:36.567 --> 03:19:38.767]  And so, that's why X3 is so amazing.
[03:19:39.287 --> 03:19:46.469]  That's why all the results we've got and the trials we have with the crew and others are so breathtakingly cool.
[03:19:46.549 --> 03:19:52.651]  If you like X2, you're gonna love X3 and Infowarslife.com.
[03:19:52.971 --> 03:19:53.611]  The next level.
[03:20:05.124 --> 03:20:07.716]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:30.157 --> 03:20:33.219]  Hi, this is Gerald Cilenti sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:20:33.279 --> 03:20:38.542]  It's always a real treat and an honor to host InfoWars.
[03:20:38.923 --> 03:20:47.448]  It's one of the few places on earth where you get real news that makes a difference rather than the garbage that they're putting out there.
[03:20:48.229 --> 03:20:51.511]  So the midterm elections, of course, that's the news of the time.
[03:20:52.411 --> 03:20:57.735]  And so what we do as trend forecasters is we read as much as we can.
[03:20:58.328 --> 03:21:00.990]  And listen and watch what's going on around the world.
[03:21:01.611 --> 03:21:12.599]  So I want to go over a couple of articles with you that put some things into perspective and not so into perspective and what to expect if the Democrats win or the Republicans win or the House is split.
[03:21:12.619 --> 03:21:16.222]  There's a major story in today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:21:16.802 --> 03:21:19.965]  Investors fret profits are peaking is one of them.
[03:21:20.845 --> 03:21:24.948]  But the other one, of course, is midterm votes have investors on edge.
[03:21:25.869 --> 03:21:26.970]  And here's what they say.
[03:21:27.853 --> 03:21:31.355]  And again, this is separating the fact from the fiction.
[03:21:32.336 --> 03:21:40.220]  In reading through it, just getting to a point, many agree that the elections could create fresh winners and losers in the market.
[03:21:41.220 --> 03:21:56.749]  Manufacturers and construction firms could get a boost if a divided Congress can come to an agreement on infrastructure spending, while banks stand to lose if a democratic suite leads to a halt
[03:21:57.389 --> 03:21:58.489]  In deregulation.
[03:21:59.650 --> 03:22:02.971]  All right, so let's look at the deregulation issue here.
[03:22:03.891 --> 03:22:16.235]  There's deregulation and it's a positive one in the elements that the small banks have really been hit hard with the Dodd-Frank amendments that were put in following the panic of 08.
[03:22:17.416 --> 03:22:19.316]  The big banks just got bigger.
[03:22:19.936 --> 03:22:21.837]  So it's not going to hurt them at all.
[03:22:22.637 --> 03:22:24.678]  And as far as infrastructure spending,
[03:22:25.854 --> 03:22:28.336]  It's not going very fast or very much.
[03:22:28.916 --> 03:22:33.219]  That's not going to have a big play on the equity markets.
[03:22:34.140 --> 03:22:35.821]  Here's what's really going on.
[03:22:36.401 --> 03:22:39.643]  The numbers don't lie and the facts stand by themselves.
[03:22:41.284 --> 03:22:49.010]  History suggests the stock market will fare well no matter who wins on Tuesday.
[03:22:49.950 --> 03:22:55.514]  The S&P 500 has risen in the year after every midterm election
[03:22:56.787 --> 03:23:24.900]  Since 1946, according to brokerage and advisory firm Strategus, analysts attributed this to investors redeploying funds kept on the sidelines ahead of the elections, as well as the market's tendency to climb throughout history.
[03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:27.470]  So that's the story.
[03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:36.715]  So all of this, where the market's going, what's going to happen, you can see what's going to happen and you can look at the markets now.
[03:23:37.975 --> 03:23:41.577]  They're up over 200 points, the Dow as we speak.
[03:23:42.498 --> 03:23:48.861]  The ones to really watch and where the world economy is going is what's going on in China, man.
[03:23:50.302 --> 03:23:54.584]  That Shanghai Index, man, the composite index, it's down
[03:23:55.558 --> 03:24:01.441]  Beyond bear territory, bear territory where they're hanging out at like 20% down, they're down over 30.
[03:24:02.141 --> 03:24:03.562]  And it just keeps getting worse.
[03:24:04.382 --> 03:24:12.406]  President Xi of China just came out today to encourage the country that things were going to get better.
[03:24:14.967 --> 03:24:21.970]  There is a lot of talk that the Chinese are devaluing their currency purposely so they could export more product.
[03:24:22.931 --> 03:24:24.111]  We disagree with that.
[03:24:24.211 --> 03:24:25.352]  We don't see that at all.
[03:24:26.237 --> 03:24:27.178]  For two reasons.
[03:24:28.839 --> 03:24:30.220]  Number one is imports.
[03:24:31.300 --> 03:24:32.681]  They import a lot of product.
[03:24:33.862 --> 03:24:37.584]  And if their currency goes down, it costs them more to buy that stuff.
[03:24:38.585 --> 03:24:42.227]  Yes, as the currencies go down, you can buy their stuff cheaper.
[03:24:42.847 --> 03:24:44.829]  If your dollar gets stronger, which it has.
[03:24:45.549 --> 03:24:48.431]  But, let's look at the entire situation in China.
[03:24:51.493 --> 03:24:54.795]  80% of China's gross domestic product
[03:24:56.914 --> 03:25:02.295]  Is by that 1.3 billion people spending money.
[03:25:03.096 --> 03:25:03.956]  Consumers.
[03:25:04.536 --> 03:25:06.637]  Here in the States, it's about two-thirds.
[03:25:07.457 --> 03:25:11.118]  So they don't want to see this thing go down, but it's going down.
[03:25:11.958 --> 03:25:15.339]  You're looking at direct infrastructure investment in China?
[03:25:16.659 --> 03:25:18.139]  1992 levels.
[03:25:18.339 --> 03:25:18.940]  That's right.
[03:25:18.960 --> 03:25:24.061]  1996, the total debt was, just to put it into perspective,
[03:25:24.705 --> 03:25:27.726]  It was about $500, $600, $900 billion.
[03:25:28.446 --> 03:25:30.686]  Today, it's over $30 trillion.
[03:25:32.026 --> 03:25:37.368]  China is the big issue here, as well as the emerging markets that are submerging.
[03:25:38.268 --> 03:25:43.749]  The United States is doing better than virtually any country, and of course, of all the major countries.
[03:25:44.669 --> 03:25:49.570]  We're number one when it comes to the stock markets and the growth in the economy.
[03:25:50.580 --> 03:25:59.442]  Of course, a lot of it has to do with the stock buybacks that boosted the markets up, and they keep accelerating, along with the tax cuts that made that happen.
[03:26:00.362 --> 03:26:03.003]  But looking at China is the big issue to look at.
[03:26:03.943 --> 03:26:10.384]  The gross domestic product grew this last quarter at its slowest rate since 2009.
[03:26:10.464 --> 03:26:14.365]  The panic of 2008, 2009, things were not so cheery.
[03:26:14.625 --> 03:26:14.745]  So,
[03:26:19.980 --> 03:26:30.745]  Going back to the United States and the midterms, we don't think it's going to have much effect on the markets at all, regardless of who wins tomorrow.
[03:26:31.645 --> 03:26:37.788]  The other factor being that it's bigger than that.
[03:26:39.069 --> 03:26:40.189]  It's interest rates.
[03:26:41.250 --> 03:26:43.231]  So here's what we have to say about that.
[03:26:44.771 --> 03:26:46.092]  Trump will still be president.
[03:26:47.330 --> 03:26:56.652]  And we think there's going to be more and more pressure from President Trump on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates down.
[03:26:57.973 --> 03:26:59.853]  Can the president have that power?
[03:27:00.713 --> 03:27:06.054]  Well, you saw what happened with Paul Volcker, right?
[03:27:08.015 --> 03:27:08.575]  Remember that?
[03:27:10.776 --> 03:27:12.076]  Just came out with his new book.
[03:27:13.516 --> 03:27:16.677]  He had to meet with
[03:27:18.899 --> 03:27:25.581]  President Reagan and Chief of Staff James Baker at the White House.
[03:27:26.662 --> 03:27:30.963]  But they brought him into the library, he said, because they didn't think it was taping anything there.
[03:27:32.224 --> 03:27:36.906]  And Reagan just sat there and Baker said to Paul Volcker.
[03:27:39.066 --> 03:27:43.508]  You have an order from the president not to raise interest rates.
[03:27:45.389 --> 03:27:48.430]  Before election day, remember, Paul Volcker
[03:27:48.763 --> 03:27:50.224]  It's a Federal Reserve chair.
[03:27:51.245 --> 03:27:51.745]  The U.S.
[03:27:51.805 --> 03:27:59.911]  Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin, whoever it is at the time, could fire the Fed chair.
[03:28:00.992 --> 03:28:16.404]  So going back to the economy in the midterm elections, we don't believe that it's going to make much difference who wins tomorrow, because the power of the presidency
[03:28:16.957 --> 03:28:18.839]  Still remains in Trump's hands.
[03:28:19.519 --> 03:28:22.061]  Oh, and let's not forget, folks.
[03:28:23.182 --> 03:28:33.530]  Remember how the Democrats got wiped out in 2010 after the fraud Obama came into office?
[03:28:35.051 --> 03:28:36.592]  We're going to be back in a little bit.
[03:28:37.353 --> 03:28:39.074]  We're going to see what's going to happen next.
[03:28:40.676 --> 03:28:44.278]  They lose the House, state governments around the country.
[03:28:45.459 --> 03:28:46.180]  Be back in a few.
[03:28:48.398 --> 03:28:52.530]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:28:53.272 --> 03:28:54.756]  It's Alex Jones.

[03:30:05.572 --> 03:30:06.713]  Yeah, Halloween was intense.
[03:30:06.773 --> 03:30:09.296]  Everyone had outrage because of outfits.
[03:30:09.997 --> 03:30:14.702]  Like, the big thing around college campuses was, uh, it's a culture, not a costume.
[03:30:15.163 --> 03:30:20.589]  And so they get mad at white people wearing, like, sombreros or, like, those rice patty hats or any of those big hats.
[03:30:21.129 --> 03:30:25.054]  Yeah, I think it's way more racist to say that all Mexicans wear sombreros.
[03:30:28.143 --> 03:30:29.783]  Do you understand my line of thinking?
[03:30:29.803 --> 03:30:33.264]  Where it's like, don't wear the, don't wear the sombrero, because that's their hat.
[03:30:34.104 --> 03:30:34.924]  It's like, what?
[03:30:35.744 --> 03:30:37.245]  You think that's like their hat?
[03:30:39.205 --> 03:30:43.306]  It's the same with, I want a sombrero, I want a rice paddy hat, because I don't like the sun.
[03:30:43.686 --> 03:30:45.326]  That's a killer hat for white people.
[03:30:45.346 --> 03:30:47.567]  You gotta have that big old brim.
[03:30:48.287 --> 03:30:53.668]  You know, it seems like the left, the authoritarians, whatever you want to call them, the ruling elite,
[03:30:54.571 --> 03:30:57.554]  They have a list over who's protected at that moment.
[03:30:57.594 --> 03:31:06.082]  It's usually based on some sort of dystopian future that they're trying to roll out for us so a small amount of people can become incredibly wealthy and powerful.
[03:31:06.903 --> 03:31:08.905]  And who you can and can't mock.
[03:31:09.765 --> 03:31:16.572]  And so, if I was... Like, there is no outfit that you can't...
[03:31:17.914 --> 03:31:21.735]  That should be off limits, because everything would quote-unquote offend someone.
[03:31:21.755 --> 03:31:24.376]  The concept of offense is mind-blowing.
[03:31:24.756 --> 03:31:28.477]  If someone tells me they're offended, I'm just like, oh, I'm sorry to hear how weak you are.
[03:31:28.497 --> 03:31:33.079]  Like, I feel like they're kind of almost like opening up to me, like admitting how weak they are.
[03:31:33.099 --> 03:31:36.860]  It's almost like saying, like, that they have herpes or something, where it's like, hey man, I'm offended.
[03:31:36.880 --> 03:31:40.161]  I'm like, I'm so sorry that you were raised so badly and you're so weak.
[03:31:41.621 --> 03:31:46.805]  Because when you think about cultural appropriation, all it does is it tries to put people into boxes.
[03:31:47.745 --> 03:31:50.868]  And that's what globalists want to do.
[03:31:50.928 --> 03:31:56.912]  If you look at Agenda 21 or any of these things that I've been exposed to ever since I've been watching Alex Jones' show.
[03:31:57.492 --> 03:32:03.376]  Ever since he got censored, I started watching him and now I'm exposed to all this stuff of nightmares like Agenda 21.
[03:32:03.796 --> 03:32:05.958]  But anyway, so I started thinking about it.
[03:32:06.138 --> 03:32:07.439]  If anyone needs a sombrero,
[03:32:08.470 --> 03:32:09.010]  It's the whites.
[03:32:09.770 --> 03:32:16.812]  Because I was looking at this guy, I'm like... The sun is beating down on our white skin, and we need a giant brim.
[03:32:16.852 --> 03:32:25.495]  And this is how, this is why I believe that God has a sense of humor, because the whitest people on the planet, pasty, very white people, traditionally white people, have the smallest hats.
[03:32:25.655 --> 03:32:26.975]  And of course, I'm referring to the Jews.
[03:32:27.635 --> 03:32:31.376]  The Jews have a tiny little hat called a yarmulke, and it doesn't have a brim at all.
[03:32:31.396 --> 03:32:32.977]  It looks like a swim cap for a kitten.
[03:32:33.677 --> 03:32:41.383]  And so they have no sun protection, but yet these Hispanic people with these beautiful brown resilient skin to the sun of these giant brims.
[03:32:41.463 --> 03:32:46.446]  So my proposal is for Mexicans and Jews to switch hats.
[03:32:46.726 --> 03:32:48.888]  And see, that's actual problem solving.
[03:32:48.948 --> 03:32:51.610]  You know, if anyone needs a sombrero, it's the whites.
[03:32:51.730 --> 03:32:53.951]  And if anyone needs a larger hat, it's the Jews.
[03:32:54.152 --> 03:32:57.314]  And so I believe that that is how we actually start solving some problems.
[03:33:05.160 --> 03:33:07.861]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:24.764 --> 03:33:30.305]  Hi, this is Gerald Cilenti, sitting in for Alex Jones, hosting this next half hour.

[03:35:22.307 --> 03:35:24.008]  I mentioned before about interest rates.
[03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:27.070]  It can't go higher.
[03:35:28.411 --> 03:35:28.992]  Here's why.
[03:35:30.333 --> 03:35:36.176]  This whole post-panic-of-08 boom was juiced by cheap money.
[03:35:37.077 --> 03:35:39.158]  Zero and negative interest rate policy.
[03:35:39.178 --> 03:35:40.479]  You've heard me say this and others.
[03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:43.911]  Times, a thousand times.
[03:35:45.512 --> 03:35:47.233]  And you can see it in the numbers.
[03:35:48.454 --> 03:35:50.816]  Take a look at what's going on in the housing market.
[03:35:52.317 --> 03:36:03.324]  Over there in California, when I was a young guy in the trends business, beginning it back in the 1980s, they used to say, you know, the trends begin out in California, move their way east.
[03:36:03.984 --> 03:36:04.585]  No, they don't.
[03:36:04.645 --> 03:36:06.046]  But they believe that.
[03:36:06.086 --> 03:36:08.027]  But some did and some do.
[03:36:08.807 --> 03:36:11.129]  And one of them to watch is housing.
[03:36:13.655 --> 03:36:21.039]  Southern California, man, numbers are dropping heavy when interest rates for mortgages hit 5%.
[03:36:22.760 --> 03:36:32.785]  New home sales, existing home sales, new mortgage applications, the amount of new listings going on.
[03:36:33.866 --> 03:36:38.808]  Not only Southern California, way up there in Silicon Valley.
[03:36:39.008 --> 03:36:40.189]  That's the perfect name for it.
[03:36:40.729 --> 03:36:41.970]  Silicon, right?
[03:36:42.908 --> 03:36:50.349]  Silicon con men and women, gotta be equal here, con men and con women.
[03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.910]  Silicon.
[03:36:52.470 --> 03:36:53.490]  That's all they are.
[03:36:54.150 --> 03:36:57.511]  Anyway, things aren't going so good up there either.
[03:36:58.631 --> 03:37:00.711]  Can't take higher interest rates.
[03:37:02.432 --> 03:37:05.292]  Look at the home building sector.
[03:37:07.533 --> 03:37:08.793]  Look at the stocks.
[03:37:11.044 --> 03:37:14.466]  They're way deep into bear territory, down way over 20%.
[03:37:14.586 --> 03:37:26.592]  Hey, today Lowe's just announced they're closing a bunch of stores in Canada and the USA.
[03:37:27.913 --> 03:37:28.953]  It's slowing down.
[03:37:30.094 --> 03:37:32.595]  We're calling this a stage one recession.
[03:37:33.976 --> 03:37:38.258]  We don't buy the little propaganda that the government puts out, tells you when you're in a recession.
[03:37:39.539 --> 03:37:40.119]  The motto,
[03:37:40.979 --> 03:37:43.180]  Or the transjournalist, think for yourself.
[03:37:45.161 --> 03:37:50.985]  If the real estate market starts going down, the whole thing starts unraveling below it.
[03:37:51.805 --> 03:37:53.946]  Because of all the sectors that are related.
[03:37:54.507 --> 03:37:55.987]  Oh, like a Lowe's.
[03:37:56.668 --> 03:37:57.868]  And Lowe's goes lower.
[03:37:59.509 --> 03:38:01.931]  And then you look at the stock numbers that are coming out.
[03:38:03.552 --> 03:38:06.313]  Oh, you know, Starbucks.
[03:38:07.734 --> 03:38:09.515]  There's a story right here in the paper.
[03:38:10.370 --> 03:38:15.513]  They just had to announce that it gets jolt from robust sales!
[03:38:15.953 --> 03:38:16.053]  Huh!
[03:38:16.073 --> 03:38:22.156]  You know what the robust sales were?
[03:38:24.837 --> 03:38:35.763]  Growth came entirely from a 5% rise in the average ticket for the period.
[03:38:37.644 --> 03:38:39.105]  The number of transactions
[03:38:40.023 --> 03:38:44.745]  In the US fell 1% from a year earlier.
[03:38:45.485 --> 03:38:53.348]  Higher prices help Starbucks deliver its strongest quarterly sales gain in more than a year.
[03:38:55.649 --> 03:39:00.411]  Higher prices, not greater sales.
[03:39:03.112 --> 03:39:05.593]  Facebook, less people
[03:39:07.927 --> 03:39:08.747]  Numbers go up.
[03:39:08.847 --> 03:39:09.328]  Wait a minute.
[03:39:09.348 --> 03:39:10.368]  You're losing audience.
[03:39:10.468 --> 03:39:10.888]  Twitter.
[03:39:11.808 --> 03:39:12.669]  Losing audience.
[03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:15.550]  How could their stocks go up?
[03:39:16.870 --> 03:39:17.851]  General Motors.
[03:39:19.031 --> 03:39:20.212]  Selling less cars.
[03:39:20.832 --> 03:39:23.693]  Oh yeah, but the ones we're selling, people are paying more for.
[03:39:24.253 --> 03:39:25.434]  That drove our revenue.
[03:39:26.834 --> 03:39:34.137]  It's one company after another that's reporting this kind of news.
[03:39:35.692 --> 03:39:40.055]  So you can see the facts and the fiction behind it.
[03:39:41.316 --> 03:39:43.298]  Because the reality is.
[03:39:45.640 --> 03:39:50.443]  Companies splurge on stock repurchases.
[03:39:51.844 --> 03:39:56.268]  We were the first magazine to call the Trump rally.
[03:39:57.269 --> 03:39:58.930]  Let's go back to Election Day.
[03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:58.930]  2000.
[03:40:01.091 --> 03:40:01.252]  And 16.
[03:40:07.233 --> 03:40:14.178]  When it showed that Trump was going to win, those markets fell.
[03:40:14.218 --> 03:40:16.759]  The pre-open markets were down 800 points.
[03:40:18.761 --> 03:40:25.365]  Within hours, they did a 180 and went way up.
[03:40:27.166 --> 03:40:30.609]  We said this is the beginning of the Trump rally.
[03:40:31.049 --> 03:40:31.870]  Coined the term.
[03:40:33.491 --> 03:40:33.991]  All throughout 2017,
[03:40:36.294 --> 03:40:37.535]  Trump rally continue.
[03:40:38.476 --> 03:40:42.578]  February, we forecast the market correction and it did.
[03:40:44.160 --> 03:40:45.701]  We said the end of the Trump rally.
[03:40:46.962 --> 03:40:50.644]  The markets will continue to grow at a moderate pace.
[03:40:51.765 --> 03:40:55.087]  But again, here's what's doing it.
[03:40:55.908 --> 03:40:59.951]  Companies are splurging on stock buybacks.
[03:41:01.332 --> 03:41:04.254]  This is the weekend edition of
[03:41:06.001 --> 03:41:07.001]  The Wall Street Journal.
[03:41:07.902 --> 03:41:18.807]  Net buybacks in the month totaled just $12 billion by October 19th, but jumped to $39 billion by October 29th.
[03:41:20.387 --> 03:41:31.532]  That is more than the $30 billion recorded in September, and just under the $48 billion recorded in August.
[03:41:32.192 --> 03:41:33.113]  Let's go back now.
[03:41:33.753 --> 03:41:35.714]  Remember the markets were going down in October?
[03:41:37.324 --> 03:41:38.605]  All of a sudden, boom!
[03:41:39.265 --> 03:41:40.985]  A surge of stock buybacks.
[03:41:41.786 --> 03:41:44.587]  That's pulling stocks off the market.
[03:41:44.907 --> 03:41:47.028]  Supply and demand drives up the price.
[03:41:47.048 --> 03:41:50.249]  And there's another thing pushing prices up.
[03:41:50.989 --> 03:41:55.311]  They're doing it in China, and you can bet they're going to do it in the United States.
[03:41:55.471 --> 03:41:57.952]  The United States has the Plunge Protection Team.
[03:41:58.932 --> 03:42:00.933]  Big story in the Trends Journal about that.
[03:42:01.393 --> 03:42:03.094]  Created during the Reagan administration.
[03:42:04.449 --> 03:42:08.132]  Stocks go down, they go in and buy them up, bring them back the price up.
[03:42:08.773 --> 03:42:11.795]  Over in China, they got the national team.
[03:42:12.776 --> 03:42:24.265]  And the national team has been very active, buying up stock, and they're still not very successful in what they're doing there, even though they're buying them back and buying them up.
[03:42:25.747 --> 03:42:28.529]  So, we're on shaky ground here.
[03:42:30.660 --> 03:42:38.585]  As I mentioned before, when Alex was on during the Clinton administration, they used to say, if you wanted to run for office, it's the economy, stupid.
[03:42:39.945 --> 03:42:42.827]  Now, it's interest rates, stupid.
[03:42:43.528 --> 03:42:45.108]  We'll be back in a little bit.
[03:42:45.509 --> 03:42:46.569]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:42:47.210 --> 03:42:48.510]  Put your money where your heart is.
[03:42:48.650 --> 03:42:49.431]  Buy some products.
[03:43:05.299 --> 03:43:08.461]  Okay, so I have a gift here from the folks at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:08.582 --> 03:43:14.727]  They wanted to thank me for getting the InfoWars t-shirts on the Rangers game for millions of people at sea, so they just brought me a gift.
[03:43:14.747 --> 03:43:15.828]  I don't even know what this is.
[03:43:15.848 --> 03:43:18.750]  Let's see what's going on.
[03:43:18.770 --> 03:43:19.291]  Wait a second.
[03:43:19.331 --> 03:43:19.551]  No!
[03:43:20.832 --> 03:43:21.193]  No!
[03:43:21.633 --> 03:43:22.233]  I got it!
[03:43:23.835 --> 03:43:25.136]  It's a Trump-inducer shirt!
[03:43:25.156 --> 03:43:25.877]  Look at that, guys!
[03:43:29.446 --> 03:43:30.927]  I got the Trump-Medusa shirt!
[03:43:31.628 --> 03:43:31.948]  What's that?
[03:43:31.968 --> 03:43:32.648]  There's more in there?
[03:43:33.129 --> 03:43:33.249]  Oh!
[03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:36.131]  It's a George Washington!
[03:43:36.471 --> 03:43:36.911]  Wow.
[03:43:38.112 --> 03:43:39.573]  I was not expecting this, really.
[03:43:39.613 --> 03:43:40.294]  Look at that one.
[03:43:40.814 --> 03:43:42.315]  That'll trigger somebody real good.
[03:43:43.236 --> 03:43:43.536]  Oh yeah.
[03:43:45.217 --> 03:43:45.938]  Wow, wow.
[03:43:45.998 --> 03:43:48.279]  I'm like a kid on Christmas today.
[03:43:48.800 --> 03:43:49.100]  Man.
[03:43:49.961 --> 03:43:52.142]  I want to thank the folks at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:52.442 --> 03:43:53.223]  This is amazing.
[03:43:53.303 --> 03:43:54.444]  I was not expecting this.
[03:44:08.136 --> 03:44:13.420]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[03:44:14.421 --> 03:44:21.307]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:44:21.567 --> 03:44:24.010]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:44:24.650 --> 03:44:25.551]  I want to keep going.
[03:44:25.591 --> 03:44:29.895]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:44:29.935 --> 03:44:31.896]  I want to push all the way.
[03:44:32.857 --> 03:44:33.798]  I've committed to do that.
[03:44:33.938 --> 03:44:34.759]  I've prayed for that.
[03:44:35.319 --> 03:44:36.921]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:44:36.961 --> 03:44:40.003]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:44:40.824 --> 03:44:43.286]  I will give the total sacrifice.
[03:44:43.867 --> 03:44:44.968]  I will never falter.
[03:44:45.548 --> 03:44:47.590]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:44:47.890 --> 03:44:48.571]  I physically will.
[03:44:49.031 --> 03:44:55.817]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at fullwarrestore.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:45:01.821 --> 03:45:06.885]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[03:45:07.005 --> 03:45:11.750]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega-Silver.
[03:45:11.970 --> 03:45:15.313]  That is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[03:45:15.373 --> 03:45:18.236]  It is Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel, trademarked.
[03:45:18.376 --> 03:45:24.104]  For first aid, management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and second degree burns, skin irritations.
[03:45:24.324 --> 03:45:26.547]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[03:45:26.667 --> 03:45:28.990]  Some medical grade stores have it.
[03:45:29.190 --> 03:45:30.873]  It's just incredible.
[03:45:31.033 --> 03:45:31.614]  It's $29.95 out of the gate.
[03:45:31.714 --> 03:45:32.895]  This is next level.
[03:45:32.955 --> 03:45:34.457]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[03:45:34.998 --> 03:45:39.161]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[03:45:39.502 --> 03:45:43.905]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[03:45:44.045 --> 03:45:47.488]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[03:45:47.648 --> 03:45:48.909]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[03:45:49.069 --> 03:45:55.914]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist, and we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals.
[03:45:56.555 --> 03:46:00.958]  And he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[03:46:01.198 --> 03:46:03.220]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:04.601 --> 03:46:05.221]  888-253-3139.
[03:46:05.241 --> 03:46:13.146]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[03:46:13.686 --> 03:46:17.929]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using in the military, hospitals, you name it.
[03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.810]  This is it.
[03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:21.471]  There's only one other silver stronger and it's by prescription.
[03:46:21.592 --> 03:46:28.036]  This stuff is thermonuclear, nanotech, super small particles which go in electromagnetically, just goes right in the heart of something.
[03:46:30.589 --> 03:46:39.671]  Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel contains the powerful Silver Sol technology that revolutionized the colloidal nano silver market.
[03:46:39.871 --> 03:46:52.634]  As the only FDA certified wound treatment product of its kind, this gel has been shown to fight infection and irritation while also helping speed up the healing process.
[03:46:52.834 --> 03:46:55.015]  And that's the way I like it.
[03:46:55.095 --> 03:46:58.876]  Grab a bottle of Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel right now.
[03:47:00.356 --> 03:47:01.198]  Alex Jones dot com.
[03:47:05.127 --> 03:47:07.733]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:27.102 --> 03:47:29.884]  Hey, this is Gerald Cilenti, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:47:30.064 --> 03:47:32.845]  Always great being on InfoWars.
[03:47:32.965 --> 03:47:35.507]  I just heard David Knight, love being on with him as well.
[03:47:36.267 --> 03:47:43.491]  And remember, do what you can to keep the voice of freedom and liberty alive as they try to steal it from us.
[03:47:44.332 --> 03:47:47.994]  And again, you guys know I'm a political, and women, we gotta be equal here, guys.
[03:47:48.554 --> 03:47:48.854]  Women.
[03:47:49.495 --> 03:47:50.355]  Can't say gals.
[03:47:50.715 --> 03:47:52.196]  Say guys, we can't say gals.
[03:47:52.656 --> 03:47:53.437]  Guys and women.
[03:47:54.557 --> 03:47:57.038]  There's nothing correct, by the way, about politically correct.
[03:47:57.078 --> 03:47:58.919]  Look up the definition of a politician.
[03:47:59.519 --> 03:48:05.181]  Someone who's manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization.
[03:48:05.621 --> 03:48:06.701]  That's the definition.
[03:48:06.761 --> 03:48:14.564]  So anyway, it's up to you to keep the voice of freedom alive and do what you can
[03:48:15.379 --> 03:48:21.625]  To support InfoWars and all the great programming that they do, the great guests that they bring on here.
[03:48:22.365 --> 03:48:30.673]  And their InfoWars 67% off blowout sale is a blowout that you better take advantage of.
[03:48:30.693 --> 03:48:35.838]  I mean, I'm just hearing that they're going to be... This is the end of super male vitality?
[03:48:35.858 --> 03:48:40.462]  What am I going to use to keep that boogie alive and keep going?
[03:48:41.082 --> 03:48:41.723]  Not a lot.
[03:48:42.404 --> 03:48:49.227]  So I'm going to buy as much as I can of this, because when it runs out, where are you going to go for it?
[03:48:49.848 --> 03:48:53.089]  So do what you can to keep InfoWars alive.
[03:48:53.450 --> 03:48:59.092]  Buy their wonderful products with this 67% off blowout sale.
[03:48:59.112 --> 03:49:00.553]  What else do they have here?
[03:49:01.453 --> 03:49:05.295]  Oh, they have the Brain Force Plus, now available.
[03:49:06.676 --> 03:49:07.897]  Survival Shield X3.
[03:49:09.642 --> 03:49:13.405]  Alex Pure Pro Water Filtration System.
[03:49:13.905 --> 03:49:16.767]  Boy, that's something everybody needs, man.
[03:49:17.208 --> 03:49:17.428]  Woof!
[03:49:18.048 --> 03:49:20.130]  The poison water around this country.
[03:49:20.150 --> 03:49:31.318]  I was just reading something had come out from Wisconsin up there about the 3M plant out there that allegedly has poisoned the water for people.
[03:49:32.049 --> 03:49:46.542]  I mean, with all the poisons in the water, you want this filtration system and all these other products to keep you healthy, happy, jumping and alive, and to keep Alex Jones and the crew out there and all the great guests.
[03:49:47.483 --> 03:49:55.850]  And when you get to hear a guy like Roger Stone and all these others that he has on there that speak to truth in their hearts rather than
[03:49:56.155 --> 03:50:02.580]  What the prostitutes do, get paid to put out by their corporate whores and their Washington whoremasters.
[03:50:03.781 --> 03:50:11.808]  I want to stay back on the economy a bit, because as I was mentioning before, I said to Alex, it's the economy, Stu, but that's what people care the most about.
[03:50:12.528 --> 03:50:23.958]  When it hurts them in their pocketbook, and you're looking at, you know, numbers coming out, student loan debt is crushing millennials, how renters are taking it harder than
[03:50:24.953 --> 03:50:30.477]  People living in their own homes, one piece of data coming out after another.
[03:50:31.038 --> 03:50:37.343]  And I was reading about stock buybacks and talking about stock buybacks and how this is generating the future of the market.
[03:50:38.184 --> 03:50:40.786]  So it goes back to interest rates.
[03:50:41.486 --> 03:50:45.389]  It allows them to borrow cheaply in the tax cuts so they could buy back.
[03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:49.272]  If interest rates go up, this economy goes down.
[03:50:49.352 --> 03:50:50.073]  End of story.
[03:50:52.205 --> 03:50:56.349]  It has nothing to do, by the way, with tariffs or trade wars.
[03:50:56.589 --> 03:50:58.311]  That is so much BS.
[03:50:59.311 --> 03:51:09.441]  When you add the tariffs that Trump has put on China, they amount to 0.7% of China's GDP.
[03:51:10.421 --> 03:51:10.802]  Nothing.
[03:51:11.963 --> 03:51:16.407]  Meanwhile, hey, the United States just had another record-breaking trade deficit.
[03:51:17.679 --> 03:51:28.426]  Who would do business like this when you're dealing with a country that makes $375 billion more than you do in merchandise trade?
[03:51:28.786 --> 03:51:30.087]  And you're supposed to take it?
[03:51:30.428 --> 03:51:34.250]  The media should be 100% behind Trump.
[03:51:34.911 --> 03:51:41.035]  But again, the media is not because Clinton is paying back the Democrats for the deregulation.
[03:51:41.095 --> 03:51:43.236]  That's why they're going after Trump, as we see it.
[03:51:44.177 --> 03:51:47.499]  Anyway, cosmetic firm Estee Lauder.
[03:51:48.826 --> 03:51:54.110]  Whose shares have dropped by as much as 14% during October.
[03:51:55.351 --> 03:52:04.958]  On Wednesday, announced plans to buy back 40 million shares, or 11% of its total outstanding.
[03:52:06.339 --> 03:52:08.521]  So you saw the markets going down.
[03:52:08.961 --> 03:52:10.362]  This is what's driving them up.
[03:52:12.904 --> 03:52:16.107]  Past week, international business machines.
[03:52:18.032 --> 03:52:21.333]  $4 billion worth of buybacks.
[03:52:25.015 --> 03:52:37.919]  And financial exchanges operator, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., announced a plan for repurchases worth $2 billion.
[03:52:39.440 --> 03:52:43.321]  Elsewhere, Netherlands-based Royal Dutch Shell, $2 billion on buybacks.
[03:52:46.533 --> 03:52:50.235]  Between July 26th and October 19th.
[03:52:52.337 --> 03:52:58.241]  On Thursday, it launched a second round.
[03:52:58.261 --> 03:52:58.921]  $2.5 billion.
[03:53:01.723 --> 03:53:02.103]  All right.
[03:53:02.824 --> 03:53:05.205]  This is what's driving the markets back up.
[03:53:05.986 --> 03:53:12.470]  That, we don't know if the plunge protection there is plunging it up, but I would suggest so.
[03:53:12.490 --> 03:53:12.530]  So.
[03:53:18.973 --> 03:53:22.015]  They're boosting the value of their stocks.
[03:53:23.436 --> 03:53:26.318]  Story out today, Financial Times.
[03:53:27.198 --> 03:53:32.221]  Buffett's $1 billion buyback points to dearth of attractive deals.
[03:53:34.062 --> 03:53:36.624]  They bought $1 billion worth of stock buybacks.
[03:53:36.784 --> 03:53:47.351]  Other companies and buyout firms have pushed deal-making to heady levels, some $3.5 trillion of acquisitions
[03:53:48.317 --> 03:53:59.040]  Have been agreed this year up more than 30% from a year earlier.
[03:54:01.900 --> 03:54:03.581]  That's what's driving equities up.
[03:54:06.262 --> 03:54:08.902]  Stock buybacks merger and acquisition activity.
[03:54:09.502 --> 03:54:10.263]  How do you do it?
[03:54:11.043 --> 03:54:12.183]  Cheap money.
[03:54:13.583 --> 03:54:14.844]  Cheap money.
[03:54:15.444 --> 03:54:15.984]  Funny money.
[03:54:16.877 --> 03:54:18.878]  So they're going to keep interest rates low, we believe.
[03:54:19.618 --> 03:54:21.179]  And that'll keep the markets going.
[03:54:22.520 --> 03:54:26.982]  In the absence of that, we're going to see a stage one recession.
[03:54:27.922 --> 03:54:32.944]  You don't have to wait for two quarters of negative GDP with these phony numbers they make up.
[03:54:33.645 --> 03:54:34.485]  Watch housing.
[03:54:36.006 --> 03:54:38.287]  You know, some other trends we'll talk about here.
[03:54:38.307 --> 03:54:41.888]  There's a lot of talk about these driverless cars.
[03:54:43.349 --> 03:54:45.010]  We say it's a driverless cliff.
[03:54:46.274 --> 03:54:47.715]  Big story out today.
[03:54:47.735 --> 03:54:50.776]  You know, who do we got here?
[03:54:52.696 --> 03:54:55.577]  Uber pledges self-driving safety.
[03:55:02.080 --> 03:55:04.401]  There's about 45 million recalls.
[03:55:05.061 --> 03:55:08.082]  Just in the last couple of weeks, you saw a bunch of them coming in.
[03:55:09.955 --> 03:55:11.756]  That's just in the United States.
[03:55:12.357 --> 03:55:17.021]  2016, there were 50 million recalls.
[03:55:17.941 --> 03:55:21.024]  And it takes forever to get these recalls fixed, by the way.
[03:55:21.684 --> 03:55:22.905]  They're showing some of them now.
[03:55:24.206 --> 03:55:27.469]  It's going to take, like, if you bring it in, it's going to take over a day to get fixed.
[03:55:27.489 --> 03:55:36.856]  So you're going to tell me you're going to have a driverless car, and you can't get the ignition switches, brakes, and other minor issues fixed?
[03:55:37.616 --> 03:55:39.638]  They're becoming too technology-driven.
[03:55:41.789 --> 03:55:49.036]  You know, there was that saying that the meek shall inherit the earth, according to the King's James Bible.
[03:55:50.077 --> 03:55:58.305]  One of our top trends for 2019 is that the geeks have inherited the earth.
[03:55:59.626 --> 03:56:05.532]  Could you imagine these soulless, cold cats and kittens
[03:56:07.580 --> 03:56:28.678]  That look like nothing, speak like nothing, act like nothing, not a drop of passion, not an ounce of boogie, or a drip of jive, censoring everybody that they don't like.
[03:56:31.360 --> 03:56:34.223]  Having you not think for yourself, but ask Alexa,
[03:56:35.012 --> 03:56:38.174]  Oh, hey, see that new story that came out?
[03:56:38.754 --> 03:56:39.615]  Probably didn't.
[03:56:40.295 --> 03:56:42.737]  It was on the back pages of the paper over the weekend.
[03:56:43.657 --> 03:56:47.519]  Yeah, them cell phones, that radiation, woof, microwaves.
[03:56:49.481 --> 03:56:52.923]  Boy, hey, guys, keep that cell phone in your pocket.
[03:56:53.423 --> 03:56:56.965]  You better take more of this super male vitality, man.
[03:56:57.245 --> 03:57:01.668]  You better pump it up because it's going to knock it down.
[03:57:02.048 --> 03:57:02.889]  I don't have a cell phone.
[03:57:02.949 --> 03:57:03.649]  I don't carry one.
[03:57:03.971 --> 03:57:04.951]  When I travel, I do.
[03:57:04.991 --> 03:57:05.692]  Got one in the car.
[03:57:05.712 --> 03:57:08.573]  In case the car breaks, something happens, you know.
[03:57:09.173 --> 03:57:10.413]  But I don't carry one of those things.
[03:57:11.654 --> 03:57:12.694]  Yeah, the study came out.
[03:57:13.374 --> 03:57:13.734]  Buried.
[03:57:14.515 --> 03:57:14.875]  Buried.
[03:57:16.515 --> 03:57:21.277]  So, going back, the geeks have inherited the Earth.
[03:57:22.157 --> 03:57:24.898]  They've taught us how to stop thinking for ourselves.
[03:57:25.578 --> 03:57:28.999]  So if you want to think for yourself, consider getting the Trends Journal.

[03:58:54.553 --> 03:58:55.913]  That's because it's been denatured.
[03:58:55.953 --> 03:58:56.714]  It's been watered down.
[03:58:56.754 --> 03:58:57.894]  We didn't do that.
