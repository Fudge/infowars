[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.301]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:22.883]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:26.884]  But these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever, ever meet.
[00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:29.785]  But we're gonna punch through the media.
[00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:30.725]  We have to.
[00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:30.945]  Do not
[00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:35.114]  We're good to go.
[00:00:52.515 --> 00:00:54.197]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[00:00:54.217 --> 00:00:54.837]  Victory for the world.
[00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:17.293]  It is Friday, June 29th, 2018.
[00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:20.394]  I'm your host, Owen Troyer, filling in for Alex today.
[00:01:20.454 --> 00:01:26.677]  We will be hearing from Alex in the next segment, as well as later on in today's broadcast.
[00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:28.558]  There is all kinds of news to get through.
[00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:35.462]  The left keeps pushing farther and farther when it comes to trying to incite violence.
[00:01:37.108 --> 00:01:44.271]  Former President Barack Hussein Obama made a rare public appearance and gave a speech yesterday.
[00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:46.172]  I've got some poll quotes from that.
[00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:48.093]  You're honestly not even going to believe.
[00:01:49.673 --> 00:02:03.159]  In shocking fashion, after a shooting yesterday at the Capital Gazette, I guess I shouldn't be so shocked, left-wingers are actually blaming this on conservatives.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.240]  Now, there's
[00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:30.896]  Origins to this that go back to a text from a certain author and broadcaster that they're trying to link to this and then they're using that tiny little origin that's not even legitimate to expand and blame all conservatives.
[00:02:32.697 --> 00:02:34.959]  And I didn't believe that it would go that far.
[00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:40.559]  At least now, but it actually has.
[00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:50.528]  And if you go on Twitter, you'll actually see people blaming Trump and conservatives for this shooting.
[00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.310]  See?
[00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.331]  There it is right there.
[00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:54.452]  I don't know who these people are.
[00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:55.613]  These are verified accounts.
[00:02:56.033 --> 00:03:00.997]  And it's one thing when I see just a bunch of no-name small accounts do this.
[00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.452]  Because those could be bots, those could be fake accounts.
[00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:11.959]  But when you have verified accounts, well now you're wondering who are these people and why would they actually say that?
[00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:20.206]  Even when you have the evidence that the shooter was a psycho.
[00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:27.252]  Why is it every time now there's a warning beforehand?
[00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:29.274]  Again.
[00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:35.636]  This guy stalked and made threats to his girlfriend.
[00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:39.518]  I mean, I guess that goatee alone should raise red flags.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.082]  And he posted threats to the Capital Gazette on social media.
[00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:52.044]  Okay, so he has a vendetta.
[00:03:52.124 --> 00:03:53.785]  He's obviously mentally unstable.
[00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:58.167]  Probably on some pharmaceutical drugs.
[00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:03.195]  And goes and shoots up this place.
[00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:08.216]  And then they blame conservatives and Trump.
[00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:12.817]  But you know what's funny?
[00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:14.478]  I didn't even realize this until just now.
[00:04:15.118 --> 00:04:18.459]  Obama's speech yesterday actually ties into this.
[00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.599]  It all ties in together.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.541]  Even though this shooting is just probably an isolated incident where this guy had a vendetta.
[00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.491]  Clearly mentally unstable, probably on big pharmaceutical drugs.
[00:04:35.152 --> 00:04:38.413]  To see how they respond to that and then where they go.
[00:04:38.753 --> 00:04:41.494]  Notice they're not even really going after the gun this time.
[00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:43.975]  They're using it to go after Trump.
[00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:50.157]  It's like going after the gun has become old old hat to them.
[00:04:50.877 --> 00:04:52.077]  So now they go after Trump.
[00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:53.758]  That's all they have now.
[00:04:54.787 --> 00:04:59.451]  There's other news, other points, and Alex Jones joins us from the other side.
[00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:01.472]  Don't go anywhere, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:09.339]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:14.443]  But these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever, ever meet.
[00:05:15.104 --> 00:05:17.305]  But we're gonna punch through the media.
[00:05:17.345 --> 00:05:17.786]  We have to.
[00:05:20.137 --> 00:05:25.764]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:31.450]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.513]  We will not fail.
[00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:36.176]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.118]  That whether we are black
[00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:52.268]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[00:05:52.328 --> 00:05:54.270]  Victory for the world.
[00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:25.224]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:06:25.244 --> 00:06:26.005]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:30.969]  Any words about the dead in Annapolis?
[00:06:34.514 --> 00:06:44.281]  Why don't you come and talk to us about that?
[00:07:12.984 --> 00:07:17.787]  So this is President Trump walking on the White House grounds being harassed by the media.
[00:07:18.527 --> 00:07:22.030]  You wouldn't believe that they would sink this low, but they go lower every day.
[00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:31.896]  So we have another deranged individual who had a score to settle with the Gazette newspaper over a defamation suit he brought six, seven years before and lost.
[00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:36.839]  Going in with a shotgun and shooting and killing five people.
[00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:46.510]  And so now all gun owners are guilty, and President Trump is guilty, and because he's simply walking across the White House lawn, he's running away from questions.
[00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:48.413]  This is all how they spin things.
[00:07:48.433 --> 00:07:53.579]  It'd be like if you were walking in the front door of your house and your neighbor yelled across the street, why are you running?
[00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:55.931]  I think?
[00:08:11.703 --> 00:08:18.170]  To conservatives and to the president, creating a climate that allowed this to happen when this had nothing to do with it.
[00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:25.938]  This was this guy's own private beef that started with some woman he was reportedly stalking that expanded into this long-term feud with the paper.
[00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:28.641]  But now they're projecting it onto conservatives.
[00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:41.663]  While simultaneously CNN has big articles about how dare Sean Hannity mention this deranged guy and say maybe it's part of the larger climate of violence in this country that the left's calling for.
[00:08:42.363 --> 00:08:44.484]  Meanwhile, what do we see?
[00:08:44.845 --> 00:08:48.987]  We see Michael Moore saying we need to put our bodies on the line.
[00:08:49.747 --> 00:08:50.828]  We've got Hillary
[00:08:54.983 --> 00:08:55.083]  Yes.
[00:09:13.008 --> 00:09:14.389]  And on and on and on.
[00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:15.910]  This is the atmosphere.
[00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.212]  This is the system that's being pushed.
[00:09:18.412 --> 00:09:20.733]  And they're the ones that shot Scalise.
[00:09:21.534 --> 00:09:22.955]  They're the ones calling for violence.
[00:09:22.975 --> 00:09:24.396]  They're the ones saying kidnap Barron.
[00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:28.138]  They're the ones in all these different newspapers and magazines saying assassinate Trump.
[00:09:28.158 --> 00:09:33.082]  They're the ones with former CIA Deputy Director Phil Mudd on TV saying the government's going to kill this guy.
[00:09:33.102 --> 00:09:37.425]  And Chuckie Schumer, Seven Ways to Sunday, the intelligence agencies.
[00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:39.966]  They're the ones running cabals trying to overthrow this election.
[00:09:40.006 --> 00:09:42.268]  They're the ones trying to derail the country coming back.
[00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:45.518]  They're creating the Civil War climate.
[00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:55.226]  And then every time there's any act of violence in the country, connected to the climate or not connected, like this one the evidence shows, they then project it onto those of us that are pro-America.
[00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:59.410]  If we then say maybe it's connected to you in response, they go, oh my God, this is outrageous.
[00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.431]  How dare you?
[00:10:01.031 --> 00:10:02.833]  This is the stunts they're pulling, but I'll say this.
[00:10:03.888 --> 00:10:09.049]  That place, knowing that they were controversial, knowing they had enemies, they should have had concealed carry.
[00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.270]  They should have had an armed guard.
[00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:18.051]  They should have been protecting themselves, knowing that this guy, here's the big takeaway, had been threatening them.
[00:10:18.612 --> 00:10:20.832]  People told the police he's going to be the next mass shooter.
[00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:25.313]  He'd been on Twitter making all these incredible threats, and again, nothing was done.
[00:10:25.773 --> 00:10:31.695]  Just like when Peter Fonda calls for violence and kidnapping and pedophilia.
[00:10:33.004 --> 00:10:41.888]  Just like when other people, other, you know, washed up Hollywood stars, Kluzak came out and called for, you know, firebombing government facilities.
[00:10:42.328 --> 00:10:47.170]  Just like when Antifa publishes the names and homes of ICE agents, nothing's being done.
[00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:49.531]  And that's what's encouraging all this.
[00:10:49.751 --> 00:10:54.093]  When people violate the law and say, I'm going to come kill you for sure.
[00:10:54.533 --> 00:10:57.515]  Not, not, not, not metaphorical, you know, not, no, no, no.
[00:10:58.015 --> 00:10:59.736]  But, but when you say I'm coming to get you.
[00:11:01.004 --> 00:11:02.465]  People need to get in trouble.
[00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:09.772]  And on top of that, people need to take responsibility to protect themselves and be armed if you are already a target.
[00:11:10.092 --> 00:11:12.294]  And so, most of these newsrooms are liberal.
[00:11:12.695 --> 00:11:13.515]  They're anti-gun.
[00:11:14.336 --> 00:11:16.098]  And they wish that they could disarm everybody.
[00:11:16.118 --> 00:11:16.878]  Maybe they'd be safe.
[00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:18.540]  That's not how it works.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.281]  Just like Hillary Clinton has bodyguards.
[00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:22.363]  Just like Michael Moore has bodyguards.
[00:11:23.064 --> 00:11:26.027]  Just like David Hogg has been caught with all these armed bodyguards.
[00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:29.790]  Okay, they are part of the elite, they're going to have guns regardless.
[00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.654]  And crazies are always going to be able to get weapons, just like a jihadi can get a car, or a bomb, or a knife.
[00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:35.995]  It's the same thing.
[00:11:36.055 --> 00:11:43.722]  So the answer is, begin to arm yourselves, liberals, to protect yourselves from your own kind, but also other deranged people that are out there.
[00:11:44.102 --> 00:11:53.451]  The conservatives, it's like... It's like Mr. Woods came out, James Woods, a few days ago, and said, you need to get armed, you need to get trained, you need to get prepared, you need to vote.
[00:12:03.852 --> 00:12:19.393]  You know, I used to listen to Alex Jones five years ago and he would do broadcasts talking about how there would be a shooting and then the media and the left would blame conservatives, blame veterans, and now it's actually happening.
[00:12:20.134 --> 00:12:22.176]  But I didn't think this would be the event.
[00:12:22.216 --> 00:12:30.624]  When you have all of the evidence that shows that that's not the case, this wasn't necessarily because of the charged political climate at all.
[00:12:30.664 --> 00:12:35.669]  It was an incident where you had an individual that was clearly deranged, had made threats.
[00:12:36.229 --> 00:12:39.633]  People knew that basically they knew he was going to do this.
[00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:41.714]  Just like the floor shooter.
[00:12:42.415 --> 00:12:44.317]  And just let it happen.
[00:12:47.526 --> 00:12:54.308]  But they're actually trying to pin this on President Trump and conservatives, and it's insane.
[00:12:54.768 --> 00:13:09.511]  But, when you look at the same group of people taking a photo from 2014 and claiming that that's President Trump putting kids in cages, when you look at a group of people that take a photo
[00:13:10.683 --> 00:13:24.830]  of a young girl crying that was actually rescued by border patrol agents and they say that that's Trump separating children from their families and they commit to it and then they double down on it and then they protest over it for weeks.
[00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:35.615]  Why should I be shocked that they would go with total fake news and think that this shooting has anything to do
[00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:41.709]  With being politically conservative, or liberal, or any president.
[00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:56.178]  But you know, it's amazing that while they'll sit here and call for violence, they'll then look at you and blame you for violence, while calling for violence.
[00:13:56.698 --> 00:14:04.083]  They will be the most uncivil, unhinged people on earth, and then look at you and say, you're uncivil.
[00:14:05.885 --> 00:14:07.566]  This is peak Twilight Zone.
[00:14:08.426 --> 00:14:10.327]  It honestly is peak Twilight Zone.
[00:14:12.307 --> 00:14:25.412]  But just when you thought it was peak Twilight Zone, traitor Barack Hussein Obama made a public speech yesterday that I've got
[00:14:26.317 --> 00:14:29.960]  A few poll quotes that I'm going to cover in the next segment that you won't believe.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.703]  In the meantime, during this break, why don't you check out InfoWarsStore.com?

[00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:59.223]  We'll be right back with quotes from President, former President, Trader Obama, that you won't believe.
[00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:16.729]  A few years ago, ideas that we talked about were thought to be fringe ideas, radical ideas, extremist ideas.
[00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:19.290]  Those ideas are now mainstream.
[00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.111]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country.
[00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:34.314]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd!
[00:16:42.156 --> 00:16:46.097]  Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless c***.
[00:16:46.137 --> 00:16:50.178]  What's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women?
[00:16:50.358 --> 00:16:54.799]  One way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy, so please bring on the recession.
[00:16:54.939 --> 00:16:58.180]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.521]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:13.382]  It has been said that the Republican Party's testicles just dropped.
[00:17:14.322 --> 00:17:17.384]  That wasn't an Infowars.com ad you just saw.
[00:17:17.725 --> 00:17:19.846]  That was officially put out by the Republican Party.
[00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:33.855]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're finally getting the fact that the globalists are trying to start a violent revolution in this country and overthrow it and bring it down just like Venezuela and so many others that have fallen to socialism and communism.
[00:17:34.255 --> 00:17:39.038]  The globalists recognize that InfoWars has been on the very front lines of this global awakening.
[00:17:39.438 --> 00:17:47.882]  And they don't want us to be there as this fight intensifies to continue to rally free humans all over the planet against this diabolical globalist program.
[00:17:48.163 --> 00:17:55.327]  That's why it's more critical than ever that you understand that we are not supported by George Soros or any big banks or any big corporations.

[00:18:46.485 --> 00:18:56.962]  The second American revolution with the United States now attempting to stop the global government empire, attempting to take back control of our destiny on a global scale.
[00:19:02.202 --> 00:19:05.785]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[00:19:06.205 --> 00:19:08.647]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:13.291]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:15.613]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[00:19:16.154 --> 00:19:19.136]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.

[00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:23.700]  Or wherever you go.

[00:19:39.094 --> 00:19:45.880]  With powerful, yet simple ingredients, Immune Gargle features Silver Soul Nano Silver for a powerful cleansing alternative.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.881]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:24.632]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[00:20:25.232 --> 00:20:26.892]  It's Owen Troyer.
[00:20:27.533 --> 00:20:30.293]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.953 --> 00:20:37.795]  So, even the left is wondering where is Hussein Obama?
[00:20:37.835 --> 00:20:38.416]  Where is
[00:20:47.642 --> 00:20:49.263]  Hussein Obama.
[00:20:49.323 --> 00:20:52.964]  Why hasn't Hussein made any public statements lately?
[00:20:55.305 --> 00:21:00.768]  Even left-wing magazines are asking, where is Hussein Obama?
[00:21:02.688 --> 00:21:03.909]  There it is from Variety.
[00:21:04.069 --> 00:21:05.129]  It was in New York.
[00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.030]  It was all over.
[00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.051]  Where is Hussein Obama?
[00:21:10.472 --> 00:21:15.334]  So, he gave a speech yesterday.
[00:21:16.673 --> 00:21:20.955]  The likes of which shouldn't shock you, but do shock you.
[00:21:20.995 --> 00:21:25.938]  You know, you don't hear from him as much anymore now that he's no longer the trader-in-chief.
[00:21:25.998 --> 00:21:30.560]  So, hearing from him for the first time, I think in months.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:36.283]  I mean, I can't remember an Obama speech since that secret sports speech he gave back in February.
[00:21:36.303 --> 00:21:37.604]  We looked into it, I couldn't find anything.
[00:21:38.874 --> 00:21:39.975]  So you don't hear from him much.
[00:21:40.015 --> 00:21:42.477]  So when you hear his rhetoric again, it's like, whoa!
[00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:44.439]  Oh yeah, that guy!
[00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:48.142]  Oh yeah, now I remember how we got here!
[00:21:48.162 --> 00:21:54.047]  Oh yeah, now I remember why the left has become so radicalized!
[00:21:54.187 --> 00:21:55.948]  Oh yeah, that guy!
[00:21:57.209 --> 00:21:58.050]  That guy!
[00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:04.415]  So, let's go to some poll quotes from that guy.
[00:22:04.435 --> 00:22:06.677]  This is from
[00:22:08.146 --> 00:22:10.188]  The Politico headline.
[00:22:10.308 --> 00:22:12.511]  Obama, you are right to be concerned.
[00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:18.416]  So then Politico runs with that just to give a little more gas to the radical left.
[00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:23.582]  Just to give a little more ignition fluid so that they can just pop off.
[00:22:24.684 --> 00:22:38.150]  It's actually having a, it's weird, what's happening is the radical left is becoming more radicalized and then the center, true liberal, you know, still has a mind and the ability to think for themselves left, is like, okay.
[00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.131]  Actually it was hashtag walk away that was trending for this.
[00:22:41.431 --> 00:22:42.732]  But anyway, let's go to some of these quotes.
[00:22:42.772 --> 00:22:45.833]  So, he says, you are right to be concerned.
[00:22:46.574 --> 00:22:54.137]  So again, just igniting it, just letting them know, you know, hey yeah, you should keep harassing people and starting violence, you have the right to be concerned.
[00:22:55.848 --> 00:22:58.050]  He says, do not wait for the perfect message.
[00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:04.736]  Don't wait to feel a tingle in your spine because you're expecting politicians to be so inspiring and poetic and moving.
[00:23:04.756 --> 00:23:06.377]  You know who he's talking about?
[00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:06.978]  Himself.
[00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:09.460]  He's saying, don't expect another me.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.162]  I'm the best ever.
[00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.092]  So still thinks that highly of himself, even though, guess what?
[00:23:15.412 --> 00:23:17.414]  You campaigned for Hillary and she lost.
[00:23:17.674 --> 00:23:17.994]  Oops.
[00:23:18.535 --> 00:23:18.735]  Ouch.
[00:23:19.855 --> 00:23:21.136]  He says, boil it down.
[00:23:21.356 --> 00:23:23.878]  If we don't vote, then this democracy doesn't work.
[00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:29.022]  Okay, well, first of all, the democracy doesn't work when you import voters.
[00:23:31.502 --> 00:23:34.943]  The democracy doesn't work when you import voters, which is what you want to do.
[00:23:35.023 --> 00:23:37.464]  So don't sit here and tell me you care about the democracy working.
[00:23:37.784 --> 00:23:42.685]  But then furthermore, that's what, see, they want to make this a democracy.
[00:23:42.725 --> 00:23:44.226]  This is a democratic republic.
[00:23:44.306 --> 00:23:45.886]  You cannot vote away my rights.
[00:23:45.926 --> 00:23:49.667]  My rights are given to me by God, not by the government.
[00:23:50.587 --> 00:23:53.408]  So you can't even vote away my rights, but that's what they want you to believe.
[00:23:53.968 --> 00:23:55.429]  They want to vote away the country.
[00:23:55.489 --> 00:23:57.249]  They want to vote away the republic.
[00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:58.890]  He goes on.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.084]  I'll be honest with you, if I have a regret during my presidency, it is that people were so focused on me.
[00:24:07.825 --> 00:24:09.145]  Just give that for ya, just a little.
[00:24:10.646 --> 00:24:16.510]  Now, he stuck to his routine of never saying President Donald Trump's name in public.
[00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.771]  So Trump is like Voldemort to these people.
[00:24:20.063 --> 00:24:21.424]  They can't even say his name.
[00:24:22.024 --> 00:24:25.427]  Oh man, Obama, you are about to be so exposed.
[00:24:25.587 --> 00:24:28.009]  It is unbelievable.
[00:24:28.529 --> 00:24:33.893]  Honestly, I sit here and I wonder when I do some deep research at night, like, how much of this is actually going to come out?
[00:24:36.455 --> 00:24:36.895]  Oh man.
[00:24:38.716 --> 00:24:39.317]  Oh my gosh.
[00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:40.718]  I gotta get focused here again.
[00:24:41.118 --> 00:24:45.141]  My mind just, it just goes and it's just like, you just remember everything we're dealing with.
[00:24:46.385 --> 00:24:46.765]  I go on.
[00:24:46.845 --> 00:24:47.346]  Okay, okay.
[00:24:47.406 --> 00:24:49.828]  And so here is where it gets shocking.
[00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:52.590]  And again, how did we get here?
[00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.392]  How did the left become so radicalized?
[00:24:56.133 --> 00:24:56.853]  This guy!
[00:24:56.993 --> 00:24:57.874]  This is the guy!
[00:24:59.155 --> 00:25:00.036]  Hussein Obama!
[00:25:02.861 --> 00:25:05.082]  He says, fear is powerful.
[00:25:05.762 --> 00:25:20.065]  Telling people that somebody's out to get you or somebody took your job or somebody has it out for you or is going to change you or your community or your way of life, that's an old story and it has shown itself to be powerful in societies all around the world.
[00:25:20.725 --> 00:25:25.387]  It is a deliberate, systematic effort to tap into that part of our brain that carries fear in it.
[00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:26.827]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:25:27.992 --> 00:25:31.973]  Is this not what Hussein Obama is doing in this speech?
[00:25:32.713 --> 00:25:45.056]  He is using fear in this very speech to incite his audience and then he's going to lecture you about someone else using fear as a motive?
[00:25:46.916 --> 00:25:56.278]  Is it not the Democrat Party using fear right now to stew up all of this hatred for Trump and Trump supporters?
[00:25:57.568 --> 00:25:58.328]  This is incredible!
[00:25:59.749 --> 00:26:02.871]  He's actually telling you his means of propaganda.
[00:26:03.032 --> 00:26:04.833]  He's giving you his weapon system.
[00:26:06.154 --> 00:26:18.462]  They are the ones trying to make you fearful of Trump, when all Trump is, is just the return of prosperity, the return of... Like, I'm sitting here watching the news and they're like, trade wars ignited, trade wars!
[00:26:19.085 --> 00:26:20.145]  Are you kidding me?
[00:26:20.565 --> 00:26:21.986]  The trade war's been going on!
[00:26:22.006 --> 00:26:23.666]  We've been getting our asses kicked!
[00:26:24.147 --> 00:26:25.927]  We're actually competing now!
[00:26:26.287 --> 00:26:28.788]  And they're like, oh, trade war.
[00:26:29.168 --> 00:26:32.109]  It's like, oh, oh, just for America, competing is a trade war.
[00:26:33.829 --> 00:26:34.350]  I go on.
[00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.771]  He says, there's a fundamental contrast of how we view the world.
[00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:44.873]  We are seeing the consequences of when one's vision is realized or in charge.
[00:26:46.533 --> 00:26:48.454]  No, that's what we saw from you.
[00:26:51.638 --> 00:26:54.575]  And then, to bring it home, he says.
[00:26:56.178 --> 00:27:04.245]  I am not surprised that instead of replacing what we had done with something better, they just have done their best to undermine and erode what's already in place.
[00:27:04.265 --> 00:27:04.705]  Yeah, thank God.
[00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:12.392]  Of course people are going to be angry about that, because if you had health care and suddenly... Oh my gosh, if you... Listen to this.
[00:27:12.872 --> 00:27:14.253]  Oh, get ready to start rolling.
[00:27:14.954 --> 00:27:21.059]  If you had health care and suddenly somebody who says they're going to make it better comes in and makes it worse, you'll be pissed!
[00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:22.260]  You should go out and vote!
[00:27:25.515 --> 00:27:29.938]  I get told I say literally a lot, but literally that's what happened.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.241]  Let me just read that again for you in case you missed that one.
[00:27:34.482 --> 00:27:34.942]  Focus here.
[00:27:36.143 --> 00:27:38.365]  Of course people are going to be angry about that.
[00:27:39.065 --> 00:27:45.110]  Because if you had health care and suddenly someone who's saying they're going to make it better comes in and makes it worse, you'll be pissed.
[00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.331]  You should go out and vote.
[00:27:47.492 --> 00:27:50.374]  That came from Barack Obama.
[00:27:50.894 --> 00:27:54.017]  The guy who said he'd make your health care better, then made it worse.
[00:27:54.929 --> 00:27:55.710]  And what happened?
[00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:56.951]  We went out and voted!
[00:27:56.971 --> 00:27:59.994]  I mean, who is this guy talking to?
[00:28:00.054 --> 00:28:00.614]  I need to finish.
[00:28:01.315 --> 00:28:03.878]  Reality has an interesting way of coming up and biting you.
[00:28:03.938 --> 00:28:05.539]  You bet your bottom dollar, Barack.
[00:28:05.699 --> 00:28:06.480]  You're about to find out.
[00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:08.202]  Hardcore.
[00:28:08.822 --> 00:28:16.530]  And the other side has been peddling a lot of stuff that is so patently untrue that you can get away with it for a while, but at a certain point, you confront reality.
[00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.552]  This is happening to him right now.
[00:28:20.293 --> 00:28:22.874]  The Democrats' job is not to exaggerate.
[00:28:23.154 --> 00:28:23.734]  That's what they're doing.
[00:28:23.874 --> 00:28:27.395]  The Democrats' job is not to simply mimic the tactics of the other side.
[00:28:27.415 --> 00:28:28.436]  No, they're going full violence.
[00:28:28.976 --> 00:28:33.978]  And we have... All we have to do is work hard on behalf of that truth.
[00:28:34.118 --> 00:28:35.538]  And if we do, we'll get better outcomes.
[00:28:35.778 --> 00:28:37.039]  Well, you know why you keep losing?
[00:28:37.059 --> 00:28:38.679]  Because you're a bunch of liars.
[00:28:38.879 --> 00:28:40.000]  Because you're a bunch of phonies.
[00:28:41.357 --> 00:28:46.259]  Because nobody buys a bunch of phony garbage like the speech you gave last night.
[00:28:46.879 --> 00:28:49.800]  You two-faced phony, you're about to be exposed.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.120]  Hardcore.
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:57.022]  What other operations were you running besides the illegal spying on the Trump campaign and the American people?
[00:28:57.282 --> 00:29:00.123]  What other operations did Barack Obama run?
[00:29:03.371 --> 00:29:07.914]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:29:07.934 --> 00:29:08.454]  Thanks for holding.
[00:29:08.514 --> 00:29:09.435]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:29:09.935 --> 00:29:13.497]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[00:29:13.557 --> 00:29:21.643]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet now.
[00:29:21.663 --> 00:29:22.303]  I thought it was
[00:29:22.443 --> 00:29:38.569]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[00:29:39.089 --> 00:29:47.617]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:29:47.697 --> 00:29:52.461]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:57.845]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[00:30:05.916 --> 00:30:07.317]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:30:07.377 --> 00:30:09.218]  Victor, you're calling, go ahead.
[00:30:09.338 --> 00:30:10.779]  Yes, hi Alex.
[00:30:10.879 --> 00:30:17.082]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:30:17.283 --> 00:30:21.265]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:30:21.505 --> 00:30:22.946]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:30:23.326 --> 00:30:30.250]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it like
[00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.171]  I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:36.653]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[00:30:36.953 --> 00:30:38.554]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:30:38.574 --> 00:30:40.815]  It's people like you that didn't fund the whole operation.
[00:30:40.835 --> 00:30:45.918]  Because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[00:30:45.938 --> 00:30:46.398]  So, thank you.
[00:30:46.438 --> 00:30:52.261]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:30:52.381 --> 00:30:53.862]  It is our highest reviewed product.
[00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:57.709]  Because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:00.774]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're gonna find to a silver bullet.
[00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:10.200]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:10.760]  You're on the air.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.941]  Thanks for holding.
[00:31:11.961 --> 00:31:12.801]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:13.621]  Hey, brother.
[00:31:13.921 --> 00:31:14.281]  Good, man.
[00:31:14.302 --> 00:31:15.122]  Thank you for calling.
[00:31:15.202 --> 00:31:15.742]  Hey, hey.
[00:31:15.842 --> 00:31:20.264]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:31:20.484 --> 00:31:26.826]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:31:26.846 --> 00:31:28.666]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:31:28.746 --> 00:31:35.729]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:31:36.069 --> 00:31:37.189]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:31:37.249 --> 00:31:41.250]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:43.271]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:31:43.711 --> 00:31:44.451]  And exactly.
[00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:48.712]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:31:49.053 --> 00:31:49.333]  Boom!
[00:31:49.473 --> 00:31:52.293]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:31:52.353 --> 00:31:52.894]  It's amazing.
[00:31:52.934 --> 00:31:57.175]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:07.898]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:32:07.918 --> 00:32:08.438]  Thanks for holding.
[00:32:08.598 --> 00:32:13.482]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:32:13.562 --> 00:32:26.613]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[00:32:26.813 --> 00:32:30.475]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[00:32:30.575 --> 00:32:37.438]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body.
[00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:38.298]  It's all amazing.
[00:32:38.318 --> 00:32:39.039]  Thank you, brother.
[00:32:39.099 --> 00:32:47.622]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:32:47.682 --> 00:32:52.445]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:32:52.585 --> 00:32:55.406]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[00:32:55.626 --> 00:32:58.931]  You, the crew, and the listeners out there.
[00:32:58.951 --> 00:32:59.511]  1776 Worldwide.
[00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:09.024]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:26.914]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[00:33:26.994 --> 00:33:30.036]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.437 --> 00:33:33.039]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:42.986]  President Donald Trump is speaking right now, making remarks celebrating the six-month anniversary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
[00:33:43.086 --> 00:33:45.068]  Let's go to the President.
[00:33:46.829 --> 00:33:48.531]  Before going any further,
[00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:59.507]  I'd like to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland.
[00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:06.232]  This attack shocked the conscience of our nation and filled our hearts with grief.
[00:34:06.973 --> 00:34:15.940]  Journalists like all Americans should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their job.
[00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:22.454]  To the families of the victims, there are no words to express our sorrow for your loss.
[00:34:23.755 --> 00:34:25.657]  Horrible, horrible event.
[00:34:25.817 --> 00:34:27.078]  Horrible thing happened.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.644]  When you're suffering, we pledge our eternal support.
[00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:35.466]  This suffering is so great.
[00:34:36.927 --> 00:34:38.249]  I've seen some of the people.
[00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:39.430]  So great.
[00:34:41.178 --> 00:34:50.883]  My government will not rest until we have done everything in our power to reduce violent crime and to protect innocent life.
[00:34:53.765 --> 00:35:02.530]  And he's doing that by making sure that we have a Second Amendment right so that you can arm yourself in your place of work and your place of business.
[00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.171]  Just like Alex said,
[00:35:05.418 --> 00:35:09.759]  You know, probably people at the Capital Gazette wish that they were carrying that day.
[00:35:09.839 --> 00:35:13.520]  They wish that they had, I mean, you know, we got one right under here.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.481]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:35:15.241 --> 00:35:17.822]  So, that's how he's ensuring our safety.
[00:35:17.862 --> 00:35:18.722]  Let's go back to the President.
[00:35:18.742 --> 00:35:19.602]  This is so great.
[00:35:21.063 --> 00:35:22.363]  I've seen some of the people.
[00:35:22.383 --> 00:35:23.603]  It's so great.
[00:35:25.364 --> 00:35:35.007]  My government will not rest until we have done everything in our power to reduce violent crime and to protect innocent life.
[00:35:41.186 --> 00:35:43.407]  Let's see if we can maybe find a different feed of that, guys.
[00:35:43.467 --> 00:35:47.849]  That is the White House's YouTube channel, which is having some streaming problems.
[00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.950]  Shocking.
[00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.951]  Shocking, YouTube.
[00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:52.612]  YouTube, what's going on?
[00:35:52.852 --> 00:35:58.034]  You don't want the people to hear about the President cutting the taxes and getting jobs back?
[00:35:58.635 --> 00:36:02.257]  Why wouldn't YouTube want you... YouTube, we need to get this fixed!
[00:36:03.277 --> 00:36:05.258]  You don't even have that many people watching right now, YouTube.
[00:36:05.298 --> 00:36:06.639]  Are you trying to keep this down?
[00:36:07.836 --> 00:36:10.158]  Is YouTube trying to keep you from hearing from the President?
[00:36:10.178 --> 00:36:11.819]  Let's see if YouTube will let us hear from the President here.
[00:36:11.959 --> 00:36:22.508]  Well now you just don't even have the video playing.
[00:36:23.008 --> 00:36:24.849]  Let's just try to find a different feed.
[00:36:24.889 --> 00:36:26.231]  See if we can just find a different feed.
[00:36:27.311 --> 00:36:30.534]  Let's just try to find a different feed of the President.
[00:36:33.683 --> 00:36:34.124]  You know what?
[00:36:34.384 --> 00:36:35.205]  Here's what we're going to do.
[00:36:35.425 --> 00:36:45.338]  Let's find a different feed, but let's pick it up when he starts talking about the jobs cuts.
[00:36:45.358 --> 00:36:47.141]  Alright.
[00:36:48.186 --> 00:36:48.947]  You know what?
[00:36:49.127 --> 00:36:52.829]  Let's just do this on the other side.
[00:36:53.049 --> 00:36:53.890]  Let's just do this right.
[00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.551]  Let's just do this on the other side, guys.
[00:36:55.891 --> 00:36:56.471]  So that's fine.
[00:36:56.511 --> 00:36:57.312]  Just put that on hold.
[00:36:57.792 --> 00:36:58.673]  Put that on hold.
[00:36:59.073 --> 00:36:59.994]  Let's just do that right.
[00:37:00.554 --> 00:37:02.816]  Let's figure it out in the break, and let's do it on the other side.
[00:37:03.656 --> 00:37:06.038]  So on the other side, we're going to pick up President Trump.
[00:37:06.941 --> 00:37:19.472]  But I want to get the whole thing, I don't want to have the video glitching, and we're going to have the crew pulling up all the news articles and all the stories about the jobs growth returning, the tax cuts working, the wage increases, the GDP, and everything.
[00:37:19.512 --> 00:37:23.655]  So I just want to make sure we do this right, and we're going to do it totally right, live on air.
[00:37:24.936 --> 00:37:27.699]  In the meantime, though, let's just do this.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.885]  Guys, let's go to clip 9, and let's just give some samples here to the audience.
[00:37:36.115 --> 00:37:37.876]  This is the left calling for violence.
[00:37:38.096 --> 00:37:52.823]  So how dare the left want to pin the shooting on Trump when this is clearly a vendetta and an individual being deranged incident, when you have the left saying things like Michael Moore is saying in clip 9.
[00:37:52.863 --> 00:37:55.385]  He's not going to leave.
[00:37:55.405 --> 00:37:57.786]  He plans to be re-elected.
[00:37:59.487 --> 00:38:01.528]  He loves the term president for life.
[00:38:02.264 --> 00:38:03.185]  This is a human blob.
[00:38:03.205 --> 00:38:07.228]  The only way that we're going to stop this is eventually we're all going to have to put our bodies on the line.
[00:38:08.189 --> 00:38:09.690]  You're going to have to be willing to do this.
[00:38:09.711 --> 00:38:10.371]  Pause it right there.
[00:38:10.431 --> 00:38:10.972]  Pause it right there.
[00:38:11.012 --> 00:38:14.094]  Well, first of all, you think Michael Moore is going to put his body on the line?
[00:38:14.735 --> 00:38:15.696]  I guess he already has.
[00:38:15.716 --> 00:38:16.737]  I mean, look at that thing.
[00:38:16.917 --> 00:38:17.818]  It's a human blob.
[00:38:18.318 --> 00:38:19.179]  But really, he should.
[00:38:19.219 --> 00:38:21.821]  I mean, imagine... I'm not even going to go there.
[00:38:22.862 --> 00:38:26.265]  But here he is saying we have to put our bodies on the line.
[00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:27.246]  What is he talking about?
[00:38:28.632 --> 00:38:29.954]  What is Michael Moore talking about?
[00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:31.015]  Put our bodies on the line?
[00:38:31.035 --> 00:38:32.297]  Does he want you to die?
[00:38:32.317 --> 00:38:34.399]  For a political cause?
[00:38:35.661 --> 00:38:37.624]  Is Michael Moore inciting terrorism?
[00:38:38.845 --> 00:38:39.947]  Let's go back to the Human Blob.
[00:38:40.848 --> 00:38:44.910]  When I see those children down in Brownsville, I don't see them as somebody else's children.
[00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.110]  I see them as my children.
[00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:47.391]  Those are my children.
[00:38:47.811 --> 00:38:49.912]  You know what?
[00:38:50.232 --> 00:38:51.392]  You got a D on your hat?
[00:38:51.432 --> 00:38:52.853]  That's not for Detroit, bud.
[00:38:54.054 --> 00:38:57.175]  But despair is for those who see all ends, okay?
[00:38:57.215 --> 00:38:58.675]  And we don't know what we don't know.
[00:38:58.716 --> 00:39:06.559]  And I do know that people will rise up because what would you do, each of you in the audience, if they snatched your child from you?
[00:39:07.688 --> 00:39:10.229]  And put that, what would you, how would you respond to that?
[00:39:10.249 --> 00:39:11.730]  That's how we all have to start responding.
[00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.791]  Who believes this?
[00:39:12.871 --> 00:39:25.157]  Christianity, this so-called Christian country, it's a majority of Christian country, if we actually start acting that way, if we start acting the way we were taught in Catholic school or in Bible school, wherever you went, we will have a better country.
[00:39:25.277 --> 00:39:27.578]  You hate Catholics.
[00:39:28.098 --> 00:39:32.100]  I can't believe, look, I'm serious here.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:36.082]  First of all, what do these people think is going on?
[00:39:37.346 --> 00:39:38.266]  I'm serious.
[00:39:38.686 --> 00:39:40.407]  What do these people think is going on?
[00:39:40.627 --> 00:39:42.308]  Snatching children from their parents?
[00:39:43.028 --> 00:39:44.868]  The parents are sending them here!
[00:39:46.529 --> 00:39:48.730]  Like, what is he talking about?
[00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.191]  The human blob!
[00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:52.551]  Seriously, folks.
[00:39:56.752 --> 00:40:01.934]  Are these people that blackmailed that they have to say this crap on national TV?
[00:40:02.034 --> 00:40:02.694]  I'm serious, folks.
[00:40:03.475 --> 00:40:04.155]  This is where I'm at.
[00:40:05.301 --> 00:40:10.784]  Are these people that blackmailed that they have to knowingly lie on television?
[00:40:12.185 --> 00:40:14.106]  Or is Michael Moore really that stupid?
[00:40:16.007 --> 00:40:16.948]  That's where we're at.
[00:40:18.029 --> 00:40:20.590]  Now, let's go to John Legend.
[00:40:21.431 --> 00:40:26.934]  Finally an accurate depiction of the human blob Michael Moore on the screen here, Jabba the Hutt.
[00:40:27.394 --> 00:40:28.915]  Let's now go to John Legend.
[00:40:30.407 --> 00:40:33.469]  I guess he's leaving a restaurant last night, he catches up with some paparazzi.
[00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:38.033]  Listen to what comes out of John Legend's mouth when asked about Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[00:40:38.923 --> 00:40:42.985]  Should we be personally attacking politicians, even if they're on the other side of the aisle?
[00:40:43.226 --> 00:40:46.127]  Ask me, should we be reuniting 2,000 kids with their families?
[00:40:46.688 --> 00:40:47.208]  Ask me that.
[00:40:47.288 --> 00:40:48.108]  Should we be reuniting?
[00:40:48.128 --> 00:40:48.729]  Yes, we should.
[00:40:48.749 --> 00:40:50.650]  I don't care about Sarah Sanders.
[00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:52.491]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:52.511 --> 00:40:54.392]  Reunite the kids with their families.
[00:40:54.412 --> 00:40:56.893]  Then we'll talk about Sarah Sanders and her dinners.
[00:40:57.374 --> 00:40:58.594]  Yeah, I hear that.
[00:40:58.654 --> 00:40:59.735]  Thank you for your time, sir.
[00:41:00.315 --> 00:41:00.956]  Have a good one.
[00:41:02.697 --> 00:41:04.278]  So now we know who you are, John.
[00:41:05.759 --> 00:41:06.880]  You know, that really sucks.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.881]  Because I happen to like John Legend's music a lot.
[00:41:12.082 --> 00:41:13.123]  But now we know who he is.
[00:41:16.485 --> 00:41:23.088]  John Legend has written and produced tracks, such as Woke Up This Morning, that literally make me cry.
[00:41:23.809 --> 00:41:25.950]  And now, now that I know who he is,
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.301]  I'll have no emotion from those songs anymore.
[00:41:29.461 --> 00:41:29.962]  That's sad.
[00:41:30.382 --> 00:41:32.683]  That's sad that you just had to expose yourself like that.
[00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:35.805]  And you saw it when he looked right in the camera, folks.
[00:41:37.646 --> 00:41:47.952]  And again I ask, are these people that blackmailed that they have to say this stuff and they have to be on message, or are they that stupid?
[00:41:49.813 --> 00:41:55.957]  Now, who is it that actually signed an executive order to reunite
[00:41:56.994 --> 00:41:59.715]  Children and their families when they illegally crossed the border.
[00:41:59.775 --> 00:42:00.455]  Who was that?
[00:42:02.595 --> 00:42:03.655]  That was President Trump.
[00:42:06.396 --> 00:42:14.318]  For eight years under Obama, did anyone mention anything about the children being separated at the border from their parents?
[00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:16.418]  Did anyone mention the detention centers?
[00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:18.759]  Oh, wait, actually, yes.
[00:42:19.399 --> 00:42:21.959]  Families sued President Obama.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:23.860]  Not the states!
[00:42:25.495 --> 00:42:28.337]  Not the states that are doing a political act suing President Trump.
[00:42:28.697 --> 00:42:34.480]  The actual families, the actual families sued Obama.
[00:42:36.441 --> 00:42:37.281]  Where was the media?
[00:42:37.582 --> 00:42:38.602]  Where was John Legend?
[00:42:41.244 --> 00:42:42.684]  They know they're lying, okay?
[00:42:42.864 --> 00:42:43.525]  They know they're lying.
[00:42:43.545 --> 00:42:44.425]  They're not that stupid.
[00:42:44.445 --> 00:42:45.286]  There's just no way.
[00:42:46.787 --> 00:42:47.607]  But maybe they are.
[00:42:48.347 --> 00:42:49.088]  Oh, okay.
[00:42:50.666 --> 00:42:57.872]  Now, in the real world, on the other side, we're gonna go to President Trump, who's making America great again, cutting the taxes, bringing the jobs back.
[00:42:58.092 --> 00:42:59.193]  This is the real America.
[00:42:59.413 --> 00:43:00.514]  This is America they hate.
[00:43:03.376 --> 00:43:05.298]  Remember the old days of the Internet?
[00:43:06.258 --> 00:43:08.860]  When we communicated with each other directly email to email?
[00:43:10.819 --> 00:43:11.659]  You've got mail.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.901]  But then Google came along and said, we've got Gmail.
[00:43:14.981 --> 00:43:15.141]  Why?
[00:43:15.181 --> 00:43:15.781]  It's free.
[00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:18.202]  But, of course, we read what you say and what you do.
[00:43:18.983 --> 00:43:24.845]  And then now, more and more, these big globalist companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, if they don't like you, they simply ban you.
[00:43:25.646 --> 00:43:29.948]  And, of course, if you're a conservative, they just list you as a Nazi.
[00:43:30.248 --> 00:43:32.509]  That's right, the entire Republican Party of California.
[00:43:33.329 --> 00:43:38.376]  Ladies and gentlemen, these platforms were useful for us to reach each other while they were still somewhat open and free.
[00:43:39.057 --> 00:43:42.562]  But the big monopoly companies only did this to consolidate the market.
[00:43:43.023 --> 00:43:48.130]  Now they're using that monopoly power, like all monopolies do, to abuse the general public.
[00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:57.056]  That's why it's more important than ever that you visit NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com themselves so the globalists can't censor you as easily.
[00:43:57.196 --> 00:43:58.738]  But just as important is email.
[00:43:59.138 --> 00:44:00.779]  We need to be able to talk to you directly.
[00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:06.964]  That's why it's critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for a free newsletter.
[00:44:07.444 --> 00:44:08.745]  Also under every article
[00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:13.528]  At Infowars.com and Newswars.com, you can see the little sign-up box.
[00:44:13.808 --> 00:44:14.669]  It's absolutely free.
[00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:22.375]  And that way, no matter what happens, we can send you articles, videos, special coupon codes for the shopping cart, you name it.
[00:44:22.895 --> 00:44:37.686]  It is now absolutely essential, according to all the internet experts I talk to, that everybody start going back more and more to independent email so that we can bypass the censorship in case the globalists are able to overthrow Trump
[00:44:38.406 --> 00:44:39.187]  I don't know.
[00:44:55.402 --> 00:44:55.602]  Sure.
[00:45:25.262 --> 00:45:25.563]  We're good.
[00:45:40.029 --> 00:45:42.270]  We're all pulling for the same mission.
[00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:49.252]  Americana, lower taxes, Second Amendment, religious freedom, family values, and it's happening.
[00:45:49.592 --> 00:45:57.895]  But we aren't able to communicate with each other, person to person, peer to peer, on these platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, all of it.
[00:45:57.915 --> 00:45:59.615]  More and more that's being censored.
[00:45:59.675 --> 00:46:01.716]  The shadow bans have gone to outright bans.
[00:46:02.842 --> 00:46:05.144]  And yes, we're going to try to reform these institutions.
[00:46:05.165 --> 00:46:06.166]  We're going to try to break them up.
[00:46:06.366 --> 00:46:09.249]  That's the whole process starting with congressional hearings in Congress right now.
[00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:23.443]  But during this long, hard battle, it's more important than ever that patriots, Christians, nationalists, people that are populist, not just here in the U.S., but all over the world, be able to communicate with each other and realize the importance of email.
[00:46:24.364 --> 00:46:29.308]  I personally get sick of email and how it gets full of spam, especially with my older email addresses.
[00:46:29.848 --> 00:46:35.372]  That's why, with Friends and Family, I have private email that only Friends and Family have.
[00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:46.900]  I again suggest that everybody go to mfulwards.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can send you direct videos, direct articles, and bypass the system.
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:53.545]  And yes, send you special coupon codes and other deals that are the very best we offer from mfulwardsstore.com.
[00:46:54.105 --> 00:46:56.649]  Again, my friends, thank you for joining us in the InfoWar.
[00:46:56.669 --> 00:46:57.950]  We're winning thanks to you.
[00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.431]  God bless.
[00:46:58.471 --> 00:47:00.734]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.482 --> 00:47:24.123]  President Donald Trump is making remarks right now.
[00:47:24.223 --> 00:47:29.665]  It is the sixth month anniversary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
[00:47:30.525 --> 00:47:32.566]  It's been very successful for President Trump.
[00:47:32.746 --> 00:47:35.527]  Let's now go to the president who is making remarks now.
[00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.731]  Mike Kelly, my friend, and Jason Smith.
[00:47:45.934 --> 00:47:51.297]  Our great Republican members of Congress worked night and day to score this landmark victory.
[00:47:51.337 --> 00:47:56.820]  This really was a landmark victory for their constituents, but much more importantly for the country.
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:09.167]  Unfortunately, every single Democrat in the House and Senate, that's right, every single one voted against lower taxes for the hard-working Americans.
[00:48:09.247 --> 00:48:10.527]  And you see what's happened.
[00:48:10.607 --> 00:48:13.209]  It's turned out to be something very special.
[00:48:14.298 --> 00:48:20.003]  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act slashed income taxes all across the board.
[00:48:21.284 --> 00:48:30.331]  We nearly doubled the standard deduction and did double the child tax credit, which Ivanka wanted very much.
[00:48:30.351 --> 00:48:31.272]  I will tell you.
[00:48:31.312 --> 00:48:32.332]  Stand up, Ivanka.
[00:48:32.773 --> 00:48:33.193]  Stand up.
[00:48:34.174 --> 00:48:38.277]  Now, while Trump is speaking, the crew is just pulling up all the articles and all the headlines.
[00:48:39.018 --> 00:48:42.661]  The good news about the jobs numbers, the wage increases, the tax cuts.
[00:48:43.336 --> 00:48:44.877]  You're politicians, you better be careful.
[00:48:45.697 --> 00:48:46.898]  That means you're all in trouble.
[00:48:48.779 --> 00:48:54.102]  The typical family of four earning $75,000 will see an income tax cut of more than $2,000, and in some cases more.
[00:48:59.597 --> 00:49:04.502]  And because of these tax cuts, tax returns are at record highs.
[00:49:04.522 --> 00:49:10.228]  ...for businesses of all sizes to make this the best place on earth to start a business, to invest.
[00:49:10.648 --> 00:49:14.753]  We have billions and billions of dollars of additional revenue coming in.
[00:49:15.413 --> 00:49:21.319]  We lowered the corporate tax rate so the American worker finally has a level playing field.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:27.803]  We allowed companies to deduct every single penny of investment in new equipment.
[00:49:28.263 --> 00:49:29.643]  And it's called expensing.
[00:49:29.803 --> 00:49:31.784]  It's the biggest secret in the plan.
[00:49:31.864 --> 00:49:35.026]  I think it'll go down as maybe the most important element.
[00:49:35.686 --> 00:49:37.167]  It's one-year expensing.
[00:49:37.227 --> 00:49:38.727]  Nobody thought we'd ever see that.
[00:49:39.388 --> 00:49:43.009]  So incredible for starting up a business or running a business.
[00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:50.633]  We greatly reduced the burden of the unfair estate tax, commonly known as the death tax.
[00:49:51.693 --> 00:49:53.715]  You know, that's such a big thing.
[00:49:53.775 --> 00:49:54.375]  Yeah, that was a crime.
[00:49:54.415 --> 00:49:59.719]  And most farms and most small business will not pay any estate tax or death tax anymore.
[00:49:59.739 --> 00:50:00.199]  Such a big crime.
[00:50:00.499 --> 00:50:00.760]  Good.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.862]  That was a crime against the American people, that tax.
[00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:06.744]  Thank you, President Trump.
[00:50:06.764 --> 00:50:11.307]  We created Opportunity Zones to promote more jobs in low-income communities.
[00:50:12.068 --> 00:50:13.429]  We opened ANWR.
[00:50:13.669 --> 00:50:14.530]  That's a big one.
[00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:15.851]  And the Democrats hate it!
[00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:21.531]  Here's Trump putting jobs back in inner cities and the Democrats hate it.
[00:50:21.992 --> 00:50:25.853]  That was one that they said no president could get it for many years.
[00:50:26.013 --> 00:50:29.075]  I wasn't going to do it because I was angry at someone.
[00:50:29.155 --> 00:50:30.675]  I said I'm not going to do it.
[00:50:31.576 --> 00:50:35.437]  And then when I heard that Ronald Reagan couldn't do it, nobody could do it.
[00:50:35.477 --> 00:50:37.138]  They've been trying for 50 years.
[00:50:37.158 --> 00:50:39.019]  I said, oh, let's do that immediately.
[00:50:39.039 --> 00:50:40.519]  It's like a challenge.
[00:50:40.539 --> 00:50:42.200]  Right?
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:42.900]  Challenge.
[00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:44.521]  And he keeps winning.
[00:50:46.599 --> 00:50:48.041]  And they've started that process.
[00:50:48.121 --> 00:50:48.961]  It's going to be something.
[00:50:49.021 --> 00:50:50.042]  One of the biggest in the world.
[00:50:50.843 --> 00:51:06.198]  We also repealed, in our tax cut plan, we repealed the most, I guess you could say, unpopular thing I've seen in a long time in politics or legislation, the individual mandate on Obamacare.
[00:51:07.327 --> 00:51:09.147]  Yeah, a forced payment.
[00:51:09.587 --> 00:51:10.728]  They said they wouldn't do it.
[00:51:10.828 --> 00:51:11.228]  They did.
[00:51:11.248 --> 00:51:12.188]  How about that?
[00:51:12.228 --> 00:51:13.268]  Thank you, President Trump.
[00:51:13.588 --> 00:51:13.988]  Thank you.
[00:51:14.168 --> 00:51:15.589]  Effectively killing Obamacare.
[00:51:15.649 --> 00:51:16.329]  Thank you, President Trump.
[00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:23.710]  That's where you have the privilege of paying a fortune in order to not pay to have bad health care.
[00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:24.390]  Think of that.
[00:51:24.791 --> 00:51:28.211]  So in other words, you pay a lot of money not to have health care.
[00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:29.611]  So it's not working too good.
[00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:36.713]  In about $30,000 a year, that individual mandate would cost the average family about $30,000 a year before receiving any health care.
[00:51:37.853 --> 00:51:38.593]  Thank you, President Trump.
[00:51:53.579 --> 00:52:02.366]  Secretary Azar coming out in a very short period of time, which is going to be, I think it's going to perhaps match your plan from Department of Labor.
[00:52:02.427 --> 00:52:03.968]  It's going to be something very special.
[00:52:04.548 --> 00:52:12.735]  Six months after our tax cuts, more than six million workers have received bonuses, pay raises, and retirement account contributions.
[00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:14.637]  That's right.
[00:52:16.562 --> 00:52:17.943]  Tax cuts are coming through just here.
[00:52:18.043 --> 00:52:19.604]  You can drive around your local city.
[00:52:19.624 --> 00:52:23.927]  You'll see one in, a pay raise on the board, on the side of the walls and everything.
[00:52:24.147 --> 00:52:33.374]  I love to see happy faces, but I'll stand in line sometimes before or after a speech and I'll be with a lot of people that want pictures for whatever reason they want a picture of me.
[00:52:34.635 --> 00:52:36.496]  And I stand with the police a lot.
[00:52:36.956 --> 00:52:37.477]  And I'll see a
[00:52:38.411 --> 00:52:41.553]  A policeman, and in particular one in New York City.
[00:52:42.253 --> 00:52:43.614]  And he said, sir, I want to thank you.
[00:52:43.654 --> 00:52:45.975]  You've made me a hero to my wife and to my family.
[00:52:46.015 --> 00:52:47.676]  I've always been a horrible investor.
[00:52:48.317 --> 00:52:55.241]  But this year, my 401k, think of it, is up like 46%, I think he said.
[00:52:55.741 --> 00:52:57.622]  My wife thinks I'm a genius.
[00:52:57.642 --> 00:53:00.824]  She thinks I'm the greatest investor for the first time in my life.
[00:53:02.088 --> 00:53:06.649]  Yeah, if you've had a 401k under Trump, you've seen massive increases.
[00:53:06.669 --> 00:53:14.392]  In terms of value or worth, we've created $7 trillion worth of value for our country.
[00:53:14.492 --> 00:53:21.634]  And people don't know this, we're double the size, almost double the size, because we hear China, and China's terrific.
[00:53:22.214 --> 00:53:23.895]  And our relationship is terrific.
[00:53:23.935 --> 00:53:24.715]  We're straightening out
[00:53:25.885 --> 00:53:28.487]  The balance, and I think most people want to see that.
[00:53:29.288 --> 00:53:32.971]  But we're the largest economy in the world by far.
[00:53:34.112 --> 00:53:38.576]  And as you know, we've increased a lot over the last one and a half years.
[00:53:39.456 --> 00:53:43.260]  But we're almost double the size of China and far bigger than anybody else.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:48.564]  And we're going up very rapidly, and it's going to continue to go up very rapidly.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.101]  Biggest in the world, by far.
[00:53:52.301 --> 00:53:55.343]  He's now thinking we can have a 6% GDP growth, folks.
[00:53:55.403 --> 00:53:56.344]  That is massive.
[00:53:56.364 --> 00:53:58.626]  The biggest economy in the world, by far.
[00:53:58.826 --> 00:54:00.066]  That's the only way to do it, right?
[00:54:00.747 --> 00:54:00.967]  Good.
[00:54:01.287 --> 00:54:01.828]  It really is.
[00:54:02.368 --> 00:54:03.089]  It's pretty good.
[00:54:03.869 --> 00:54:04.930]  And they helped us.
[00:54:05.991 --> 00:54:06.771]  A little bit, right?
[00:54:06.831 --> 00:54:08.072]  Just a little, but that's okay.
[00:54:08.332 --> 00:54:09.173]  Every little bit counts.
[00:54:11.502 --> 00:54:19.130]  So, the share of small businesses raising benefits and pay has just set a new all-time record.
[00:54:19.751 --> 00:54:27.440]  And manufacturing optimism, to me, is so important because it's all about optimism, is the highest ever recorded.
[00:54:30.239 --> 00:54:33.522]  And the Democrats just ignore that, and they tell you that it's not happening.
[00:54:33.542 --> 00:54:36.164]  This is a statistic that's been around for a long time.
[00:54:36.244 --> 00:54:37.585]  Highest ever recorded.
[00:54:38.066 --> 00:54:41.328]  Hundreds of billions of dollars are coming back from overseas.
[00:54:41.929 --> 00:54:49.575]  Over $300 billion was just repatriated into our country in the first quarter alone.
[00:54:49.595 --> 00:54:50.276]  That's a record.
[00:54:50.496 --> 00:54:50.996]  Think of that.
[00:54:51.016 --> 00:54:51.577]  $300 billion.
[00:54:51.777 --> 00:54:53.618]  That's a record.
[00:54:53.658 --> 00:54:55.260]  Money we never would have seen.
[00:54:56.238 --> 00:54:59.220]  Trillions more dollars are on their way back.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:03.322]  And as you know, Apple announced they're going to spend $350 billion.
[00:55:03.462 --> 00:55:04.182]  Not million.
[00:55:04.222 --> 00:55:06.844]  I would have been happy with that, too.
[00:55:06.884 --> 00:55:10.426]  But $350 billion is being brought back.
[00:55:10.986 --> 00:55:15.128]  I guess the total amount they're bringing back is approximately $230 billion.
[00:55:15.188 --> 00:55:17.630]  And they're putting up the rest the old-fashioned way.
[00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:19.491]  They're bringing this money back.
[00:55:19.731 --> 00:55:21.312]  It would never have come back.
[00:55:21.752 --> 00:55:25.534]  They're going to build an incredible campus and lots of other things.
[00:55:26.074 --> 00:55:34.040]  We just left Wisconsin and what Foxconn is building up in Wisconsin is literally, and I said it, the eighth wonder of the world.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.521]  It's incredible what they're doing.
[00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:36.943]  15,000 jobs.
[00:55:36.963 --> 00:55:38.884]  It's going to cost 15 billion dollars.
[00:55:39.585 --> 00:55:41.986]  It is something that is so incredible you have to go see it.
[00:55:42.047 --> 00:55:43.408]  Nobody would believe what's happening.
[00:55:44.128 --> 00:55:55.151]  More than 100 utility companies have lowered prices as a direct result of our business tax cuts, saving Americans $3 billion on their utility bills.
[00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:56.671]  Utility bills are going down.
[00:55:57.411 --> 00:56:01.692]  Unemployment claims are at a 44-year low.
[00:56:01.772 --> 00:56:02.493]  That's a good one.
[00:56:02.513 --> 00:56:03.293]  44 years.
[00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:12.651]  Something I am so proud of, I love it.
[00:56:13.392 --> 00:56:19.396]  Unemployment for African-Americans is at the lowest level in the history of our country.
[00:56:19.836 --> 00:56:24.018]  Now remember, when he said that at the State of the Union, the Democrats sat and pouted.
[00:56:24.979 --> 00:56:25.579]  Think about that.
[00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:31.943]  See, I'm looking at Kevin.
[00:56:31.963 --> 00:56:34.085]  That was a good job you were right about that, Kevin, huh?
[00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:36.511]  That is something.
[00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:37.172]  We're all right.
[00:56:37.412 --> 00:56:38.814]  Everybody in this room is right.
[00:56:39.335 --> 00:56:46.704]  And I have to say, unemployment for Hispanic Americans, likewise, is at the lowest point in the history of our country.
[00:56:47.185 --> 00:56:47.846]  Unemployment...
[00:56:53.266 --> 00:56:55.228]  Unemployment for women.
[00:56:55.609 --> 00:57:00.254]  Now, if you listened to my speech two weeks ago, you would have heard me say it's the lowest in 21 years.
[00:57:00.935 --> 00:57:06.261]  Now I'm saying it's the lowest in 65 years, and soon will be the lowest in history.
[00:57:07.017 --> 00:57:10.199]  And the crew's pulling up the stories about the steel workers returning to work.
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:16.144]  Steel companies that shut down during the Obama years are now reopening and hiring thousands of people.
[00:57:16.624 --> 00:57:24.710]  I'm also very proud to say that unemployment for the disabled Americans has reached record lows giving these incredible... So this is incredible.
[00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:26.632]  President Trump speaking today.
[00:57:27.252 --> 00:57:30.034]  The six-month anniversary of the Tax Cuts and the Jobs Act.
[00:57:30.094 --> 00:57:30.274]  I mean...
[00:57:31.646 --> 00:57:33.668]  Share that video with your family and friends, folks.
[00:57:33.688 --> 00:57:37.670]  We're going to put that video as a segment on the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:39.051]  Share it with your family and friends.
[00:57:39.251 --> 00:57:45.275]  The crew pulled up hundreds of articles while President Trump is talking, talking about all the massive economic success.
[00:57:45.335 --> 00:57:46.036]  This is key.
[00:57:46.316 --> 00:57:47.577]  This is how we have the red wave.
[00:57:47.877 --> 00:57:48.878]  Show them the success.
[00:57:49.158 --> 00:57:50.359]  Show them we can keep winning.
[00:57:55.162 --> 00:57:56.823]  Well, I've been wanting to get this lady on for a while.
[00:57:56.843 --> 00:57:58.204]  We're going to her in about a minute.
[00:57:58.984 --> 00:58:01.066]  Katie Hopkins over in the UK, but she's in the U.S.
[00:58:01.126 --> 00:58:01.426]  a lot.
[00:58:01.866 --> 00:58:02.787]  Banned off Twitter.
[00:58:03.908 --> 00:58:04.948]  They want her kicked off TV.
[00:58:05.088 --> 00:58:08.451]  Another reason I wanted to get her on is the assassination of Katie Hopkins.
[00:58:08.671 --> 00:58:15.495]  State-sponsored national theater opening in a Welsh area, and it's about killing her, and she's had an attempt on her life.
[00:58:15.615 --> 00:58:17.236]  So, this is next level.
[00:58:17.316 --> 00:58:22.340]  And they want you dead because you're powerful, you're vibrant, and I'm married, but I gotta say, you are pretty sexy.
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:32.330]  Well, if you think I'm sexy, I will say I think you need your eyes tested, but I do think strong women are really fun to be around, and the reason my government is sponsoring a play... Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:33.372]  Look, I don't think you look bad.
[00:58:33.392 --> 00:58:35.414]  My point is, it's attitudes what matters.
[00:58:35.935 --> 00:58:37.757]  You have light in your eyes.
[00:58:38.097 --> 00:58:38.837]  You have light in your eyes.
[00:58:38.857 --> 00:58:44.039]  I watched all these feminists that were at this feminist meeting with Hillary yesterday, and they look like they're zombies.
[00:58:44.239 --> 00:58:45.379]  It's not that they're even ugly.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.760]  They look like something sucked their soul.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:56.563]  The reason the state wants to run the play called The Assassination of Katie Hopkins is because it would be much more convenient for them if that were true.
[00:58:57.023 --> 00:58:59.064]  One of the things the state loves is fear.
[00:58:59.284 --> 00:59:01.225]  They can control people when they're afraid.
[00:59:01.545 --> 00:59:07.687]  When you have someone like me who is not afraid of anyone, not the establishment, not the state, that's far more dangerous.
[00:59:08.087 --> 00:59:11.011]  And they would be much better for them if I wasn't around.
[00:59:11.031 --> 00:59:19.360]  So we had two jihadis sent down earlier this year because they had practiced beheading me with a dummy, with a plastic hunting, with a plastic dummy and a hunting knife.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.803]  So the threat against my life is real.
[00:59:22.063 --> 00:59:24.626]  And now the state is sponsoring a play called exactly that.
[00:59:24.666 --> 00:59:28.811]  What would happen if I got a poster with the assassination of Sadiq Khan?
[00:59:29.251 --> 00:59:31.373]  Or the assassination of a black politician.
[00:59:31.593 --> 00:59:33.094]  How would that go down, do you think?
[00:59:33.334 --> 00:59:35.516]  Oh, it would be the biggest hissy fit the planet ever saw.
[00:59:35.656 --> 00:59:36.076]  Absolutely.
[00:59:36.096 --> 00:59:46.063]  I would be banned from everything within a moment because it's the assassination of white Christian conservative woman who's passionate about her country and passionate about people's right to stand up for their country.
[00:59:46.503 --> 00:59:50.426]  It's seen as acceptable and in fact wildly amusing for the liberal elite.
[00:59:54.696 --> 00:59:58.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.332 --> 01:00:00.617]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:08.945 --> 01:00:10.246]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:17.152]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.672 --> 01:00:20.895]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:27.921]  The answer to a president that had no idea what he was doing with the economy, and perhaps even wanted it to crash,
[01:00:29.142 --> 01:00:32.145]  ...is a man who knows exactly what to do with the economy.
[01:00:32.445 --> 01:00:36.509]  A world-class, successful billionaire who is saving the economy.
[01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:43.176]  Let's go back to President Trump making comments on the six-month anniversary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
[01:00:43.763 --> 01:00:45.845]  We are getting a second chance at life.
[01:00:46.625 --> 01:00:52.410]  We are keeping our promise to buy American and hire American.
[01:00:52.830 --> 01:01:00.796]  And what's happening is our economy is so good, our unemployment is so low, and our employment is so high.
[01:01:01.277 --> 01:01:03.018]  Maybe that's an even nicer way of saying it.
[01:01:03.819 --> 01:01:07.942]  And people that want to get a second chance, inmates, people coming out of jail, where
[01:01:08.883 --> 01:01:12.425]  The stigma was so great, people weren't hiring, businesses weren't hiring.
[01:01:12.445 --> 01:01:14.687]  They're hiring them now in record numbers.
[01:01:15.488 --> 01:01:16.228]  And you know what?
[01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:20.131]  These businesses are saying they are fantastic.
[01:01:20.771 --> 01:01:21.632]  They're set.
[01:01:22.232 --> 01:01:27.235]  And there's one gentleman in particular, he hired 10 inmates, never did it before.
[01:01:28.176 --> 01:01:30.458]  And he said, I wouldn't say he said all of them.
[01:01:31.218 --> 01:01:34.420]  But he said seven of them are so incredible.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.540]  That's not a bad percentage.
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:38.482]  I think that's a better percentage than we have.
[01:01:39.122 --> 01:01:43.764]  He said seven of them are as good as he's ever had, and he's going to do a lot more of it.
[01:01:43.824 --> 01:01:48.447]  So there's nothing like a great economy to solve that problem.
[01:01:49.027 --> 01:01:49.687]  Bingo.
[01:01:50.028 --> 01:01:50.368]  Bingo.
[01:01:51.238 --> 01:01:52.318]  You want to stop crime?
[01:01:52.338 --> 01:01:53.739]  You want to stop poverty?
[01:01:53.879 --> 01:01:55.459]  Put the jobs back in the inner cities.
[01:01:55.539 --> 01:01:57.460]  Put the manufacturing back in the inner cities.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:04.602]  We're one country, and really one family, and we salute one great and beautiful American flag.
[01:02:04.662 --> 01:02:05.722]  We love that flag.
[01:02:09.063 --> 01:02:20.587]  And at last, our country finally has a tax system that is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and pro-American.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:28.503]  Trump has seen a growth in the economy that Obama didn't see in eight years.
[01:02:28.523 --> 01:02:37.889]  One incredible citizen who has benefited from our tax cuts and Job Act is Lysania Hill.
[01:02:38.229 --> 01:02:39.490]  I love that name, Lysania.
[01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:43.892]  If I have another daughter, I think I'm going to name her Lysania.
[01:02:44.012 --> 01:02:44.733]  Is that okay?
[01:02:44.773 --> 01:02:45.633]  Can I copy it?
[01:02:45.653 --> 01:02:46.354]  I like that name.
[01:02:47.454 --> 01:02:48.775]  Of Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:02:48.815 --> 01:02:49.315]  Great place.
[01:02:49.375 --> 01:02:49.896]  I know it well.
[01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:55.873]  Lasagna is the director at Customer Care at Crowley Marine.
[01:02:56.533 --> 01:03:05.138]  Following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Crowley was able to pay employees like Lasagna a big tax cut bonus.
[01:03:05.258 --> 01:03:08.379]  They took a lot of money and they gave it around to the employees.
[01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:13.702]  That bonus will help support the education of her two sons, Cameron and Christian.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:21.323]  Now, you need to understand something about this, as she looks like she's getting emotional in the background with her kids there.
[01:03:22.064 --> 01:03:26.607]  President Trump has been on the phone making deals with these companies.
[01:03:26.947 --> 01:03:29.389]  These things don't just magically happen.
[01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:30.730]  He doesn't sleep.
[01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:35.753]  He's on the phone all night, calling all these companies, getting deals done for the American workers.
[01:03:35.773 --> 01:03:36.834]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:03:38.435 --> 01:03:40.456]  And he now invites her to the podium here.
[01:03:42.337 --> 01:03:43.278]  This is Lasagna.
[01:03:44.514 --> 01:03:46.495]  Thank you, Mr. President, for the invite.
[01:03:46.855 --> 01:03:48.595]  It's an honor to be here today.
[01:03:49.676 --> 01:03:57.118]  As you said, Crowley Maritime was able to benefit from the tax reform by paying employees bonuses.
[01:03:57.799 --> 01:04:04.361]  And in return, my family, we were able to invest in our children's education.
[01:04:06.106 --> 01:04:08.088]  Nancy Pelosi says those are just crumbs.
[01:04:08.288 --> 01:04:11.210]  Your children's education is just crumbs to Nancy Pelosi.
[01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.872]  Don't you know she's worth over a hundred million dollars?
[01:04:14.413 --> 01:04:15.894]  Where'd she steal that money from?
[01:04:15.994 --> 01:04:21.158]  He will be entering into his senior year at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:04:25.686 --> 01:04:28.689]  So she gets a bonus, she invests in her kids' education.
[01:04:28.729 --> 01:04:35.855]  My youngest, Christian Hill, he will be entering into his freshman year at Savannah State, both in the fall.
[01:04:37.731 --> 01:04:45.077]  And she's up here thanking President Trump for getting the tax cuts and making the deals so that she can take that money.
[01:04:45.097 --> 01:04:48.760]  Instead of paying the government, she can invest it in her children.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.402]  That is the entire point.
[01:04:50.962 --> 01:04:52.203]  That's why we want tax cuts.
[01:04:52.223 --> 01:04:53.684]  That's why we need tax cuts.
[01:04:54.005 --> 01:04:56.907]  That's why the Democrats hate tax cuts.
[01:04:57.888 --> 01:04:59.589]  We'll be right back with more of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:10.075]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[01:05:10.236 --> 01:05:14.142]  But these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever, ever meet.
[01:05:14.163 --> 01:05:17.829]  But we're gonna punch through the media.
[01:05:17.849 --> 01:05:18.590]  We have to!
[01:05:20.928 --> 01:05:26.552]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[01:05:26.572 --> 01:05:32.516]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[01:05:32.556 --> 01:05:34.277]  We will not fail.
[01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.939]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.001]  That whether we are black
[01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:42.805]  Or brown, or white.
[01:05:42.885 --> 01:05:46.189]  We all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[01:05:46.249 --> 01:05:49.754]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:05:50.174 --> 01:05:53.799]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[01:05:54.179 --> 01:05:55.061]  Victory for the world.
[01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:15.051]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:06:15.111 --> 01:06:19.873]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:06:21.594 --> 01:06:27.416]  If you take life, do you know what you'll get?
[01:06:27.736 --> 01:06:31.717]  Odds are you won't like what it is.
[01:06:32.057 --> 01:06:36.439]  When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?
[01:06:36.837 --> 01:06:38.558]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do to start this segment.
[01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:42.240]  Now, I've got the stories in front of me.
[01:06:43.301 --> 01:06:46.523]  Hillary refuses to condemn the left becoming uncivil.
[01:06:46.983 --> 01:06:49.165]  Calls for more strength to resisting Trump.
[01:06:49.225 --> 01:06:53.087]  Michael Moore, the human blob, calls for people to put their bodies on the line.
[01:06:53.107 --> 01:06:54.768]  Now, we've been telling you this.
[01:06:54.868 --> 01:06:58.490]  Michael Savage wrote a book, I think in 2010, Stop the Coming Civil War.
[01:06:58.851 --> 01:07:02.813]  Alex Jones has been telling you there's going to be a shooting and they're going to blame conservatives for it.
[01:07:02.873 --> 01:07:04.174]  Now that it's all happening.
[01:07:05.718 --> 01:07:07.419]  But let's actually go to these clips again.
[01:07:08.379 --> 01:07:14.642]  These are the people, these are the people that are inciting violence in America.
[01:07:14.702 --> 01:07:28.087]  These are the people, and it's really just the corrupt politicians at the top and the corrupt people in Hollywood at the top that are just using the sheeple to be the fuel here.
[01:07:28.488 --> 01:07:31.689]  So let's now go to Michael Moore saying it's time to put your body on the line.
[01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:33.482]  Trump is not going to leave.
[01:07:34.202 --> 01:07:35.883]  He plans to be re-elected.
[01:07:36.563 --> 01:07:37.784]  Yeah, oh, we're going to re-elect him.
[01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.645]  He loves the term president for life.
[01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:45.348]  The only way that we're going to stop this is eventually we're all going to have to put our bodies on the line.
[01:07:45.989 --> 01:07:46.149]  All?
[01:07:46.289 --> 01:07:47.830]  You're going to have to be willing to do this.
[01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:48.730]  You think Michael Moore's going to?
[01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:53.973]  When I see those children down in Brownsville, I don't see them as somebody else's children, I see them as my children.
[01:07:54.374 --> 01:07:55.274]  Those are my children.
[01:07:55.694 --> 01:07:57.916]  Now he goes with the fake narrative about separating kids.
[01:07:59.153 --> 01:07:59.713]  So you get it.
[01:07:59.753 --> 01:08:00.973]  We've heard from the human blob.
[01:08:01.013 --> 01:08:02.134]  So put your bodies on the line.
[01:08:02.434 --> 01:08:03.854]  You know, Trump separating kids at the border.
[01:08:03.874 --> 01:08:04.934]  Put your bodies on the line.
[01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.095]  But Michael Moore won't be there to do it.
[01:08:07.335 --> 01:08:08.195]  Although maybe he will be.
[01:08:08.215 --> 01:08:14.436]  He did show up for the Russian-led anti-Hillary, or pro-Hillary, anti-Trump march.
[01:08:14.856 --> 01:08:17.237]  So he did get trolled by Russians and showed up for one of those.
[01:08:17.257 --> 01:08:18.197]  So maybe he will be there.
[01:08:18.517 --> 01:08:20.497]  Alright, now let's go to clip 10.
[01:08:21.077 --> 01:08:28.239]  This is CNN putting the blame, and MSNBC putting the blame on Trump for the most recent shooting.
[01:08:28.848 --> 01:08:47.172]  I think it's worth pointing out that we've had a constant rhetoric coming, even from the president, that the press is the enemy of the people, that's been repeated constantly, and I think it's worth noting that if there is a link here, that the publication was being targeted, that that kind of rhetoric can be very dangerous.
[01:08:47.492 --> 01:08:51.397]  We've had reporters targeted, as you know, in recent months and years.
[01:08:51.577 --> 01:08:54.280]  And it hasn't just been on the campaign trail.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:09:02.750]  Although, as you know, the vitriol really did reach fever pitch on the campaign trail as reporters were trying to cover the Trump campaign.
[01:09:03.411 --> 01:09:04.072]  So let's be clear.
[01:09:04.192 --> 01:09:05.633]  They gaslight the public.
[01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:06.875]  They lie to the public.
[01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:08.257]  They lie and start wars.
[01:09:10.543 --> 01:09:16.088]  Then there's an isolated incident with a deranged shooter who had a vendetta against this place.
[01:09:16.329 --> 01:09:17.810]  He goes and shoots the place and then what do they do?
[01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:22.034]  They use that to blame conservatives for inciting violence when that's all they do.
[01:09:22.455 --> 01:09:23.756]  And I've got more clips to prove it.
[01:09:24.817 --> 01:09:29.862]  Now let's go to Rob Reiner blaming the shooting on Trump's War on the Media.
[01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:31.731]  Uh-huh.
[01:10:01.711 --> 01:10:04.313]  We have facts and evidence, okay?
[01:10:04.373 --> 01:10:06.175]  Pull the human blob 2.0 down.
[01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:08.957]  We just have facts and evidence, logic and reasoning.
[01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:11.379]  You have a bunch of gaslighting lies.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:18.865]  So there they are, blaming this on Trump, blaming this on Trump supporters.
[01:10:19.365 --> 01:10:24.049]  Now let's go to a compilation of the truth, which is they're starting it.
[01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:31.174]  Is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box.
[01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:36.377]  You get out and you create a crowd!
[01:10:37.098 --> 01:10:39.279]  And you push back on them!
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.601]  And you tell them they're not welcome!
[01:10:41.621 --> 01:10:41.901]  Anymore!
[01:10:41.941 --> 01:10:42.161]  Anywhere!
[01:10:42.221 --> 01:10:46.504]  Their idea is, look, nonviolence hasn't worked and we are going to try to stop this.
[01:10:46.945 --> 01:10:50.347]  President Walker, how do you resist the temptation to run up and wring her neck?
[01:10:50.367 --> 01:10:52.028]  Other way, other way, other way.
[01:10:52.068 --> 01:10:53.229]  That's it, right there, form it up.
[01:10:54.346 --> 01:10:57.676]  Because I'm throwing that piece of **** against the wall till it sticks!
[01:11:03.806 --> 01:11:05.687]  Our democracy is under siege.
[01:11:05.767 --> 01:11:07.829]  People need to start taking to the streets.
[01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.410]  This is a dictator.
[01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:12.072]  This is people, this is a, we need a revolution at this point.
[01:11:12.132 --> 01:11:16.034]  We will, as per Chief Jim Hopper, punch some people in the face.
[01:11:16.214 --> 01:11:21.318]  A spokesperson, the mouthpiece for the President of the United States, to say you don't know me.
[01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:26.141]  In certain quarters in this nation, that starts a physical fight.
[01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:26.942]  Age.
[01:11:27.402 --> 01:11:29.803]  Look as his character is stabbed to death.
[01:11:31.024 --> 01:11:33.266]  And there's no mistaking the Trump connection.
[01:11:34.947 --> 01:11:40.250]  So there's the left calling for violence, inciting violence, saying fight in the streets.
[01:11:40.931 --> 01:11:47.875]  And then, out of the other side of their mouth, pointing at Trump, pointing at Trump supporters saying you're inciting violence, you're causing shootings.
[01:11:49.016 --> 01:12:00.383]  You know, we have a control over a certain amount of things here, but there's this thing called karma, and I think clip 14 maybe is the perfect example of just that.
[01:12:01.476 --> 01:12:01.656]  Hey!
[01:12:01.676 --> 01:12:01.816]  Maxine!
[01:12:01.836 --> 01:12:02.757]  Where's your nicest jeans?
[01:12:02.837 --> 01:12:03.117]  Hey!
[01:12:03.137 --> 01:12:03.517]  Maxine!
[01:12:15.265 --> 01:12:19.888]  A group called Patriot Picket took aim tonight at Congresswoman Maxine Waters last night.
[01:12:20.389 --> 01:12:27.434]  Last week, you'll recall, Waters told supporters to call out a Trump cabinet member or any members if they see them in public.
[01:12:27.774 --> 01:12:35.960]  Now, the comments have led to several incidents involving White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was asked to leave a restaurant in Virginia.
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:40.864]  So, again, you just see, so people are going to start protesting them now.
[01:12:43.516 --> 01:12:44.857]  But this is what they asked for.
[01:12:45.177 --> 01:12:49.299]  But they're going to blame us for this, they're going to blame Trump for this, when this is what they asked for.
[01:12:49.319 --> 01:12:50.600]  This is what they call for.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:56.183]  Obama calls for it, Hillary calls for it, Hollywood calls for it, and then they get it, and then they blame us.
[01:12:56.243 --> 01:12:59.945]  I mean, I can't even believe the level of madness.
[01:12:59.985 --> 01:13:02.566]  But it gets crazier.
[01:13:04.447 --> 01:13:08.870]  Listen to what Whoopi Goldberg said yesterday on The View, and I quote,
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.641]  You don't want people to take your guns?
[01:13:13.301 --> 01:13:16.122]  Get out of my behind, get out of my vagina.
[01:13:18.143 --> 01:13:23.324]  Whoopi, no one wants to be in your behind or in your vagina.
[01:13:24.905 --> 01:13:28.586]  Okay, I could go on with the comic relief here, but I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:13:29.566 --> 01:13:31.627]  Do you see how deranged these people have become?
[01:13:36.529 --> 01:13:39.550]  Whoopi Goldberg thinks she speaks for all women.
[01:13:41.104 --> 01:13:45.107]  That is how lunatic fringe, but really it's an arrogance.
[01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:53.915]  Whoopi Goldberg is so arrogant, she thinks she speaks for every woman when she says, get out of my behind, get out of my vagina.
[01:13:54.095 --> 01:13:56.117]  Because, trust me, no one's in hers.
[01:13:58.178 --> 01:14:00.680]  So who does she think she is speaking for all women?
[01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:04.263]  But I mean, really, Whoopi?
[01:14:04.924 --> 01:14:06.105]  Get out of my behind?
[01:14:06.305 --> 01:14:07.126]  I mean, come on.
[01:14:09.966 --> 01:14:10.766]  I didn't even believe it.
[01:14:10.786 --> 01:14:13.187]  I had the crew triple-check that for me to make sure she said it.
[01:14:15.148 --> 01:14:15.669]  But she did!
[01:14:17.029 --> 01:14:18.530]  She really, really did.
[01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:19.290]  Wow.
[01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:22.652]  They have gone totally insane.
[01:14:24.152 --> 01:14:27.334]  There is a cure, perhaps, and it might be Brain Force Plus.
[01:14:27.554 --> 01:14:27.994]  I don't know.
[01:14:28.394 --> 01:14:33.457]  Have we been able to do legitimate studies if Brain Force Plus can cure liberalism yet?

[01:14:44.256 --> 01:14:45.237]  Of course, I'm kidding.
[01:14:45.278 --> 01:14:46.239]  Don't go do that.
[01:14:46.259 --> 01:14:48.723]  They'll say that InfoWars calls for drugging people now.
[01:14:49.744 --> 01:14:50.385]  It's a joke.
[01:14:50.606 --> 01:14:51.066]  Relax.

[01:16:09.737 --> 01:16:10.738]  Dr. Shiva's our guest.
[01:16:11.138 --> 01:16:12.378]  Great guy running for Senate.
[01:16:12.678 --> 01:16:13.579]  Got a shot at winning.
[01:16:13.619 --> 01:16:16.100]  And Elizabeth Warren, really a smart engineer.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.420]  Very successful businessman.
[01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:18.481]  Inventor of email.
[01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:18.881]  Look it up.
[01:16:18.981 --> 01:16:19.441]  It's true.
[01:16:19.621 --> 01:16:28.866]  And he is running against Elizabeth Warren, who will not do the genetic test, who the tribes say she has no connection to in Oklahoma or other areas.
[01:16:28.926 --> 01:16:31.907]  But he's a real Indian from the subcontinent, India.
[01:16:31.947 --> 01:16:32.847]  But he's a great patriot.
[01:16:32.867 --> 01:16:33.708]  I'd love to get him in the U.S.
[01:16:33.748 --> 01:16:34.028]  Senate.
[01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:38.830]  Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, thanks for joining us for some big, breaking, exclusive news.
[01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:43.492]  You know, we got this big sign out here, you may have seen it, you know, only the real Indian can defeat the fake Indian.
[01:16:43.812 --> 01:17:00.041]  It's a very powerful meme, Alex, and I want to really explain why it's so powerful and why we put it out there, because it really is an expression of not only my anger, but pretty much everyone's anger at the corruption that is taking place in government, and Elizabeth Warren is the face of that corruption.
[01:17:00.061 --> 01:17:07.965]  So when we put that signage up on our bus, the city of Cambridge, which is supposed to be the most liberal haven on the planet, said we had to take it down
[01:17:08.885 --> 01:17:10.947]  That was on April 5th, 2018.
[01:17:10.987 --> 01:17:11.668]  We didn't do that.
[01:17:11.688 --> 01:17:16.291]  In fact, we retaliated hard and we sued them, took them to federal court, and we won.
[01:17:16.671 --> 01:17:23.797]  They surrendered completely, and then based on that, we dismissed the court case.
[01:17:23.857 --> 01:17:26.819]  Obviously, the mainstream media did not want to cover our victory.
[01:17:27.359 --> 01:17:32.383]  So what we realize, Alex, the big news is this, and this is something that's really, really important.
[01:17:32.403 --> 01:17:34.885]  You see, for far too long, the establishment
[01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:41.409]  Uh, has made politics a, uh, essentially a, uh, you know, an audience sport, right?
[01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:45.772]  They do not want the everyday citizen to actually be involved in that aspect.
[01:17:45.812 --> 01:17:48.314]  They want to make it the old Hollywood celebrity culture.
[01:17:48.334 --> 01:17:52.657]  You put a couple of people on pedestals and we're supposed to watch them and eat our popcorn.
[01:17:52.697 --> 01:17:56.900]  So what we've done here, Alex, is that's becoming really powerful is we've figured out the victory to winning.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:06.048]  And what we realized was people say, you know what, you guys have a lot of courage to put that out there because you're bringing out something in Massachusetts that people do not want to talk about.
[01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:08.350]  It's a weaponized way of getting across our message.
[01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:12.533]  So what we've done is, if you see these magnetic signs here, they're really easy.
[01:18:12.894 --> 01:18:16.597]  So we want to replicate this all over the state, Alex.
[01:18:16.657 --> 01:18:17.698]  In fact, all over the country.
[01:18:18.238 --> 01:18:28.046]  And basically, people can buy these magnetic signs you can see, as you're showing, being put on, and where, since we launched it, we have, you know, tons of people starting to write and wanting these.
[01:18:28.106 --> 01:18:29.147]  And why is that?
[01:18:29.647 --> 01:18:33.330]  And the reality is, when Elizabeth Warren... It's not about identity, right?
[01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:36.873]  The liberals want to convert it to a race issue, but it has nothing to do with race.
[01:18:36.933 --> 01:18:38.814]  It has to do with integrity.
[01:18:38.874 --> 01:18:42.357]  We're talking about someone who did not work hard, who cut in line.
[01:18:42.697 --> 01:18:46.679]  You, me, Alex, and pretty much every American watching your show works for a living.
[01:18:46.699 --> 01:18:48.520]  You know, I mowed lawns as a kid.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:52.722]  You know, learned to engineer software as a kid, as a 14-year-old kid.
[01:18:52.742 --> 01:18:54.263]  I've been working all my life.
[01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:57.905]  But Elizabeth Warren cut in front of line, and they do not want to discuss that.
[01:18:57.965 --> 01:19:03.528]  So we are bringing up not just a race issue, because for far too long, down the street is Harvard University.
[01:19:04.068 --> 01:19:12.953]  The white liberal racists who want us to keep us all on their reservation and plantation have bounded the discussion of race, Alex, and they don't know what to do with us.
[01:19:13.253 --> 01:19:16.255]  Because when we bring up that sign, they'll say, oh, that's racist.
[01:19:16.315 --> 01:19:17.055]  We'll say, really?
[01:19:17.416 --> 01:19:24.379]  And we'll flip it back and we say, look, you're the racist because you're supporting a woman who took advantage of race to get in and when she's not of that race.
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.942]  How do folks, even if they're not in Massachusetts, how do they get one of these babies?
[01:19:29.122 --> 01:19:29.702]  It's very easy.
[01:19:29.722 --> 01:19:31.464]  You just go to shiva4senate.com.
[01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:32.664]  You can find it right there.
[01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:34.085]  It's called a Road Warrior Kit.
[01:19:34.105 --> 01:19:34.886]  Go to the store.
[01:19:35.246 --> 01:19:36.427]  Get the Road Warrior Kit.
[01:19:36.447 --> 01:19:36.947]  We've made it.
[01:19:37.187 --> 01:19:38.468]  You get two magnetic stickers.
[01:19:38.488 --> 01:19:39.309]  You get a lawn sign.
[01:19:39.329 --> 01:19:40.370]  You get two bumper stickers.
[01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:41.270]  Oh my god.
[01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:43.312]  You gotta call this Operation Road Warrior.
[01:19:43.332 --> 01:19:44.092]  Is that what you're calling it?
[01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:44.632]  That's what I call it.
[01:19:44.692 --> 01:19:45.773]  It's called Road Warrior.
[01:19:46.033 --> 01:19:47.114]  Be a Road Warrior.
[01:19:47.354 --> 01:19:48.555]  That's getting back.
[01:19:49.055 --> 01:19:52.678]  So if you can't come to and pass out cards, you can't do anything.
[01:19:52.698 --> 01:19:53.518]  You know, you got family.
[01:19:53.718 --> 01:19:55.219]  Hey, I'm fully supporting this.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.680]  But I am stealing the idea.
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.582]  We're gonna launch Operation Road Warrior with our stuff too.
[01:20:06.753 --> 01:20:09.377]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:31.772 --> 01:20:39.317]  President Trump and America are celebrating the six-month anniversary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
[01:20:39.697 --> 01:20:42.659]  President Trump is delivering remarks on that right now.
[01:20:42.779 --> 01:20:44.180]  Let's go back to President Trump.
[01:20:48.483 --> 01:20:49.804]  Yes, thank you, President Trump.
[01:20:50.004 --> 01:20:50.805]  Thank you so much.
[01:20:50.905 --> 01:20:52.466]  A businessman that knows what he's doing.
[01:20:53.522 --> 01:20:56.825]  Not a hack like Obama that killed the economy.
[01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:57.925]  Perhaps he did it on purpose.
[01:20:57.966 --> 01:20:59.527]  Maybe he's really good at killing the economies.
[01:21:00.307 --> 01:21:01.188]  Maybe that's what he wanted to do.
[01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:02.649]  Maybe Soros was telling him to do it.
[01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:06.392]  Soros was invested in other countries becoming more powerful.
[01:21:06.432 --> 01:21:08.073]  That's, after all, how the guy made his billions.
[01:21:08.093 --> 01:21:10.215]  I believe he got the biggest, by far.
[01:21:11.696 --> 01:21:16.400]  Including you, Ivanka, and including all of my political geniuses out here.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:17.341]  Great job.
[01:21:18.319 --> 01:21:19.861]  It's like you're a professional speaker.
[01:21:20.201 --> 01:21:20.641]  Very good.
[01:21:20.661 --> 01:21:20.942]  Thank you.
[01:21:21.202 --> 01:21:22.103]  Have you done that before?
[01:21:22.123 --> 01:21:22.644]  I have not.
[01:21:22.824 --> 01:21:23.364]  You have not?
[01:21:23.705 --> 01:21:26.748]  That's why people relate to President Trump.
[01:21:26.788 --> 01:21:27.409]  He's just real.
[01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:28.570]  He's not staged.
[01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:29.471]  He's not fake.
[01:21:29.491 --> 01:21:30.232]  He's not phony.
[01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:30.972]  Just a real guy.
[01:21:30.992 --> 01:21:36.318]  Another American who has used his tax cut to give back to others is Guy Bercowbile.
[01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:43.342]  President of Guy Chemical in Somerset, Pennsylvania, the great state of Pennsylvania.
[01:21:43.362 --> 01:21:44.482]  Incredible place.
[01:21:45.062 --> 01:21:48.824]  Guy increased bonuses, raised salaries, and purchased new equipment.
[01:21:49.424 --> 01:21:57.227]  Guy has also hired 30 new employees to help meet customer demand, which is actually booming right now, the best he's ever had.
[01:21:58.148 --> 01:22:05.651]  And here with Guy are two of his tremendous employees, Lee and Deist, and Michelle Krulik.
[01:22:06.591 --> 01:22:17.142]  We want to ask Guy maybe if you could come up say a few words about the tax cuts and how it's affected your company and I assume your people that work for you are really happy.
[01:22:17.242 --> 01:22:17.563]  Please.
[01:22:17.583 --> 01:22:24.530]  So Trump is now inviting another individual up here.
[01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:34.507]  President Trump and the members of Congress who have voted for this tax bill, I can't tell you how much it means to my company and my employees.
[01:22:36.008 --> 01:22:40.749]  When I founded my company in 1995, I marched my house seven times.
[01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:50.291]  When Obama used to call people up for events like this, it would be quote-unquote victims or people who are now receiving a handout.
[01:22:51.158 --> 01:22:53.259]  Those were the two main occasions of Obama.
[01:22:53.299 --> 01:22:59.404]  When I say victims, I mean like, you know, a transgender or a lesbian or someone, you know, a victim of society.
[01:23:02.246 --> 01:23:08.990]  Or somebody that just received, you know, a handout, a welfare check or, you know, as promised, free health care or something.
[01:23:11.348 --> 01:23:18.260]  That's what Obama used to come up here and tout with his stuff and most of it was very superficial and there was no real meat to it.
[01:23:18.861 --> 01:23:19.642]  What did Trump do?
[01:23:20.043 --> 01:23:23.408]  Trump's policies delivered!
[01:23:25.014 --> 01:23:34.443]  So it's not a policy where you just say, oh, here's victim X, I'm gonna take care of you, and here's victim Y, I'm gonna take care of you, and you just virtue signal or give them something.
[01:23:34.724 --> 01:23:37.807]  This is a working policy that benefits everyone.
[01:23:38.307 --> 01:23:42.692]  So let's go back to, I believe the guy's name was Guy from Guy Chemicals explaining this.
[01:23:44.266 --> 01:23:50.567]  So with the tax cut money, I have been increasing salaries and we have also increased bonuses to our employees.
[01:23:51.087 --> 01:23:57.168]  I have some of my employees that have come down or are sitting out here in the fourth row, and I have two right here.
[01:23:58.588 --> 01:24:02.689]  Michelle Chulick, her son also works for us, Stu.
[01:24:03.449 --> 01:24:05.130]  Michelle is one of our line leaders.
[01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:10.831]  She is using the additional money from her increased bonus to fix her car.
[01:24:11.191 --> 01:24:12.591]  I take it so she has a reliable
[01:24:13.471 --> 01:24:14.572]  Way to work every day.
[01:24:14.593 --> 01:24:17.256]  And then the mechanic gets a benefit.
[01:24:17.456 --> 01:24:24.163]  And her and her husband are also taking a vacation, a second honeymoon, to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary this year.
[01:24:24.183 --> 01:24:30.470]  And then the hotel benefits, because they have increased revenue.
[01:24:30.811 --> 01:24:31.572]  So that's how it works.
[01:24:33.399 --> 01:24:35.702]  And Lee Dice, he's a Navy veteran.
[01:24:37.625 --> 01:24:40.770]  But the left, see the left wants your money in the hands of the government.
[01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:42.152]  You see the difference here?
[01:24:42.192 --> 01:24:44.916]  The left wants your hands, your money in the hands of the government.
[01:24:46.198 --> 01:24:48.500]  Um, he is our head of maintenance.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.462]  He's the guy that keeps my plant running.
[01:24:51.643 --> 01:24:55.526]  Um, he and his wife have two young daughters under the age of four.
[01:24:56.287 --> 01:25:03.433]  So he's using his additional money from his bonus to help offset his expenses for childcare.
[01:25:03.453 --> 01:25:04.634]  Now, so think about this.
[01:25:05.074 --> 01:25:09.538]  Trump brings these people out to talk about how the tax cuts, which are for everyone,
[01:25:10.728 --> 01:25:19.634]  He doesn't take one individual here and one individual here and say, oh, I'm gonna make sure to cater to you, less than 1% of the population.
[01:25:20.875 --> 01:25:25.818]  He installs a policy that works for everyone!
[01:25:27.599 --> 01:25:29.821]  And you don't have to take your money and give it to the government!
[01:25:29.981 --> 01:25:31.281]  You get to keep your own money!
[01:25:31.942 --> 01:25:33.723]  You get to keep the money you work for!
[01:25:35.264 --> 01:25:37.966]  This is like... I mean, is that what this is?
[01:25:39.833 --> 01:25:42.095]  Are people so ignorant on economics?
[01:25:42.235 --> 01:25:48.499]  Are people just so ignorant, they're never taught this, they don't get it, that they don't even understand the basic principles of economics?
[01:25:48.999 --> 01:25:54.763]  And then they demonize this phrase, trickle-down economics, and they say, oh, trickle-down economics doesn't work!
[01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.745]  Well, okay, you know what does work?
[01:25:57.525 --> 01:25:58.226]  Tax cuts!
[01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:12.789]  That's not a trickle-down theory, that's a quit funding the corrupt government, the metastasizing, fat, overweight, obese government, and start giving yourself some of that revenue.
[01:26:12.829 --> 01:26:14.470]  Start funding your own life.
[01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:16.631]  I mean, good lord!
[01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:18.892]  Who enjoys government services?
[01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:20.233]  Am I missing something here?
[01:26:20.894 --> 01:26:22.194]  Who wants government services?
[01:26:22.235 --> 01:26:23.755]  Who wants more government services?
[01:26:23.996 --> 01:26:25.897]  Who's begging to go to the public sector?
[01:26:27.526 --> 01:26:28.007]  No one!
[01:26:28.307 --> 01:26:29.708]  You go to the private sector!
[01:26:30.349 --> 01:26:32.711]  That's where capitalism thrives!
[01:26:35.594 --> 01:26:37.035]  But people have been lied to about this.
[01:26:37.095 --> 01:26:41.119]  Now let's go back to President Trump touting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
[01:26:41.239 --> 01:26:46.404]  Once again, Washington tried to change us, but that's not going to happen.
[01:26:46.444 --> 01:26:50.348]  Instead, we're changing Washington, and we're changing it quickly and for the better.
[01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:57.060]  And try real change in Washington.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.220]  Not making Washington a bigger fat cat.
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.261]  Cutting it to size.
[01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:02.181]  That's why our economy is booming.
[01:27:02.521 --> 01:27:04.442]  That's why our families are thriving.
[01:27:04.482 --> 01:27:06.443]  That's why our businesses are growing.
[01:27:07.183 --> 01:27:11.604]  And that is why America is winning like never, ever before.
[01:27:11.805 --> 01:27:13.425]  We're setting records every day.
[01:27:14.445 --> 01:27:16.746]  These are victories and they're your victories.
[01:27:16.886 --> 01:27:19.687]  And now what we're doing is we're straightening out our trade.
[01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:21.388]  Our trade has been a disaster.
[01:27:22.276 --> 01:27:31.264]  We were being taken advantage of as a country by many, many countries' friends and enemies and those in between.
[01:27:31.944 --> 01:27:36.148]  And sometimes our friends, in terms of trade, were treating us worse than the enemies.
[01:27:36.769 --> 01:27:40.792]  And I want to just tell you that's being taken care of very well and very beautifully.
[01:27:41.232 --> 01:27:42.874]  Our steel industry is coming back.
[01:27:43.294 --> 01:27:46.877]  Never have they seen anything like what's happened over the last four months with steel.
[01:27:46.897 --> 01:27:48.639]  They were dumping steel, dumping.
[01:27:49.359 --> 01:27:51.520]  All over our land, they were dumping steel.
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.780]  And we were losing our steel business.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:57.461]  United States Steel, the head, called me up two days ago.
[01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:57.962]  They're hiring.
[01:27:58.002 --> 01:28:00.462]  It's the most incredible thing that we've ever seen.
[01:28:01.122 --> 01:28:03.303]  We haven't expanded in 30 years.
[01:28:03.383 --> 01:28:06.744]  We haven't done anything remotely like expansion.
[01:28:07.504 --> 01:28:12.866]  And we're now expanding and renovating areas of plants that haven't been used in
[01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:14.126]  Forever.
[01:28:14.687 --> 01:28:15.487]  You remember, U.S.
[01:28:15.507 --> 01:28:16.407]  Steel was massive.
[01:28:16.427 --> 01:28:21.330]  They have plants that went a mile and a half long, and they were using little corners of plants.
[01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:25.112]  He said this has not happened for decades.
[01:28:25.432 --> 01:28:26.192]  It's back.
[01:28:27.073 --> 01:28:29.254]  We were in South Carolina the other night.
[01:28:30.014 --> 01:28:31.435]  It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:31.595 --> 01:28:34.617]  It is truly incredible what Donald Trump has done for this country.
[01:28:35.819 --> 01:28:37.500]  And it's not even debatable.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.741]  It's not debatable.
[01:28:38.901 --> 01:28:40.922]  The economy is so much better under Trump.
[01:28:41.763 --> 01:28:42.643]  It's not even close!
[01:28:43.744 --> 01:28:45.105]  It's not even close.
[01:28:45.125 --> 01:28:47.266]  I mean, just look at all the records.
[01:28:47.767 --> 01:28:50.628]  Please, ladies and gentlemen, share this video with your friends and family.
[01:28:51.389 --> 01:28:52.329]  Share this video.
[01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:53.730]  Share the video.
[01:28:53.770 --> 01:28:59.034]  We put all the news stories of all the records, all the jobs growth, everything over Trump speaking.
[01:28:59.074 --> 01:28:59.654]  It's powerful.
[01:28:59.714 --> 01:29:00.815]  Share it with your family and friends.
[01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:05.862]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:09.143]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:29:09.663 --> 01:29:15.465]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:29:15.925 --> 01:29:18.706]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:29:19.446 --> 01:29:22.889]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:29:23.269 --> 01:29:29.334]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:29:29.735 --> 01:29:34.699]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:29:35.444 --> 01:29:38.867]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:29:39.367 --> 01:29:45.912]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:29:46.573 --> 01:29:51.276]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:29:51.817 --> 01:29:56.900]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:29:57.501 --> 01:30:01.464]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:30:03.191 --> 01:30:18.429]  Tomorrow's news today, we broke down even before the London Guardian did with Leo Zagami about four or five years ago, that you would have this new Pope, the head of the Jesuits, and that now Pope Francis, as he's known, would try to finally destroy any
[01:30:18.749 --> 01:30:21.931]  Christianity, any conservatism in the Catholic Church.
[01:30:21.991 --> 01:30:27.535]  And he's now declared war on borders, declared war saying he's disgusted by people talking about Europe's Christian roots.
[01:30:27.735 --> 01:30:32.638]  He's calling for major governments to be disarmed, but of course the UN will be armed right out of Hunger Games.
[01:30:32.858 --> 01:30:43.065]  And his right-hand man, the number three person at the Vatican, Cardinal George Pell, to face trial on historic abuse charges reportedly trafficking in hundreds of young boys for decades.
[01:30:43.325 --> 01:30:44.246]  Who is this Pope?
[01:30:44.266 --> 01:30:47.788]  Why does he live behind 180-foot walls that says Europe shouldn't have any?
[01:30:47.848 --> 01:30:50.210]  Why does he say he doesn't like Europe's Christian roots?
[01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:51.991]  Why is he allied with radical Islam?
[01:30:52.211 --> 01:30:56.234]  Why is he saying the whole world should turn their weapons in, but of course the UN and the globalists?
[01:30:56.274 --> 01:31:11.085]  When we talk about Pope Francis preaching now via Twitter that everybody should disarm itself and get rid of weapons, we have to understand that Pope Francis has the best bodyguards on the planet!
[01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:19.207]  Since basically 600 years ago, there are 125 Swiss Guards.
[01:31:19.347 --> 01:31:21.428]  They use the most lethal weapons.
[01:31:21.788 --> 01:31:28.710]  So to actually state that he wants to get rid of his weapons is the biggest joke ever.
[01:31:28.730 --> 01:31:29.691]  Really, Alex.
[01:31:29.871 --> 01:31:30.511]  It's hilarious.
[01:31:31.071 --> 01:32:00.554]  And regarding Cardinal Pell, Cardinal Pell now is facing also, of course, a lot of criticism within the Vatican conservative side that tomorrow has a very important event, and that is the election of the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta that will take place on the 2nd, tomorrow, the 2nd of May 2018, in a period of uncertainty for the Knights of Malta that are seen by Pope Francis as a threat.
[01:32:00.894 --> 01:32:14.701]  Because within the Knights of Malta there are certain conservative forces that have been laying down for centuries there and don't want to give up on real Catholicism, which of course Pope Francis is completely destroying.
[01:32:14.781 --> 01:32:26.307]  This is a big thing, Alex, especially now because the Pope wants to destroy the Knights of Malta, eliminate their sovereignty status, and basically make them
[01:32:28.249 --> 01:32:33.734]  An order like all the others that he has under his control, with no independence.
[01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:41.782]  And this is a big thing that is happening on the 2nd of May 2018, probably the biggest thing at the moment in the Vatican.
[01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:50.351]  The international media, of course, doesn't know how to cover it because they are, as you know, very ignorant of these topics that me and you have been discussing for many years.
[01:32:50.951 --> 01:33:00.400]  But of course, if the conservative forces lose tomorrow, the Knights of Malta will be taken over by the Jesuits and they will be destroyed.
[01:33:06.305 --> 01:33:08.947]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:19.059 --> 01:33:22.960]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:27.462]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:28.042 --> 01:33:31.083]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:33.383 --> 01:33:36.144]  There is an awakening happening right now.
[01:33:38.685 --> 01:33:45.627]  And you can see it in the media where things that were
[01:33:47.941 --> 01:33:57.528]  Household terms like false flag and globalists and deep state, here at InfoWars, here on the Alex Jones Show, are now mega viral.
[01:33:58.048 --> 01:34:02.311]  Now get covered on a wide spectrum of news.
[01:34:05.033 --> 01:34:05.874]  And it's just incredible.
[01:34:07.594 --> 01:34:11.460]  So many people have a different approach than Infowars.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:14.264]  In fact, everyone has a different approach than Infowars.
[01:34:14.444 --> 01:34:17.028]  We're the spearhead, we're the beachhead, we're the frontlines.
[01:34:17.068 --> 01:34:17.709]  We understand that.
[01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.791]  What do I mean by that?
[01:34:20.073 --> 01:34:22.016]  Well, just look at
[01:34:23.723 --> 01:34:38.889]  If you, most people can't pay attention to news like I do, but if you watch news trends and media trends, it used to be that even the quote-unquote right-wing media would take at least six months to a year, sometimes two years, to pick up on what InfoWars was talking about.
[01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:44.292]  Then President Trump came along and kind of condensed that to like a six-month period.
[01:34:45.172 --> 01:34:49.654]  Now it's like down to like three, two months, and now it's even becoming next day.
[01:34:51.261 --> 01:34:53.123]  And this is the awakening.
[01:34:53.643 --> 01:34:55.605]  This is liberty spreading.
[01:34:57.426 --> 01:35:00.929]  This is the message of Alex Jones going mainstream, and they hate it.
[01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:08.315]  Which is just pro-America, real news, real issues, not agenda-driven.
[01:35:09.198 --> 01:35:16.552]  And so I listened to Rush Limbaugh talking about Shiva Ayyadurai yesterday, and I'm like pumping my fist.
[01:35:16.612 --> 01:35:20.078]  I'm like, finally someone else is giving him coverage!
[01:35:20.479 --> 01:35:21.681]  This is what we need!
[01:35:23.001 --> 01:35:25.982]  And it's not like, oh, Rush Limbaugh is competing with us now.
[01:35:26.062 --> 01:35:26.722]  It's like, no!
[01:35:27.162 --> 01:35:27.963]  He's on the team.
[01:35:27.983 --> 01:35:30.043]  Like, I want these people at my back.
[01:35:30.603 --> 01:35:35.485]  You don't go into war with less soldiers thinking, I'm gonna get the glory.
[01:35:36.005 --> 01:35:39.046]  No, you want as many people going in with you as possible.
[01:35:39.086 --> 01:35:40.907]  You want the biggest team possible.
[01:35:41.847 --> 01:35:42.907]  So you don't die.
[01:35:43.808 --> 01:35:44.728]  That's what this is.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.260]  It's not like a competitive thing.
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:49.901]  It's just sad.
[01:35:49.961 --> 01:35:54.682]  Everybody thinks that they gotta do whatever they gotta do to be on Fox or to be the big guy.
[01:35:54.702 --> 01:36:02.103]  And we just sit here and we just bang heads right at the gates of the globalists and we don't even know what's going on behind us.
[01:36:03.003 --> 01:36:07.564]  We just keep banging heads forward and I like to look behind to see what's going on.
[01:36:07.604 --> 01:36:08.304]  And now I'm seeing it.
[01:36:08.384 --> 01:36:08.684]  Wow.
[01:36:09.344 --> 01:36:11.025]  People are coming up.
[01:36:11.525 --> 01:36:12.965]  They're getting it and they're behind us now.
[01:36:14.518 --> 01:36:15.158]  Take the lead!
[01:36:15.219 --> 01:36:18.360]  Fine, it'd be nice if someone would like to take the lead with some of this stuff, but they won't do it.
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:26.445]  Now, just, it's just, it's just, this is why you have to fund us, this is why Infowars exists, and it's just incredible to see this happening.
[01:36:26.465 --> 01:36:32.088]  Where, again, the GOP puts out an ad showing you how unhinged the left has become.
[01:36:32.308 --> 01:36:34.249]  We've been telling you the left is unhinged for a year!
[01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:37.791]  We've been showing you the clips of Maxine Waters for a year!
[01:36:38.766 --> 01:36:41.588]  Yeah, I'm glad the GOP is putting out videos like that.
[01:36:41.848 --> 01:36:43.949]  I don't look at that like, oh, now they're competing with us.
[01:36:44.410 --> 01:36:49.653]  Oh, their video gets more than the ten different videos that Darren McBreen put together of all the leftist violence.
[01:36:50.254 --> 01:36:51.194]  It doesn't bother me.
[01:36:51.975 --> 01:36:52.755]  I love it.
[01:36:55.457 --> 01:36:55.898]  Good.
[01:36:58.699 --> 01:37:00.100]  Well done, young Vader.
[01:37:02.522 --> 01:37:03.823]  So that's just how I look at this.
[01:37:04.163 --> 01:37:06.365]  Now, I don't even remember
[01:37:07.287 --> 01:37:08.327]  Where I wanted to go here.
[01:37:08.608 --> 01:37:09.288]  What video clip?
[01:37:09.308 --> 01:37:09.808]  Oh, okay.
[01:37:09.928 --> 01:37:10.168]  I know.
[01:37:10.308 --> 01:37:10.628]  I got it.
[01:37:10.648 --> 01:37:10.848]  All right.
[01:37:10.868 --> 01:37:17.651]  But before I go to Kamala Harris, this woman, oh boy, just think about this.
[01:37:17.671 --> 01:37:22.453]  There's a couple of things I noticed in the last 24 hours that I wanted to mention here.
[01:37:22.473 --> 01:37:24.274]  Let's start with Rosenstein.
[01:37:24.294 --> 01:37:30.136]  So I went back and I watched the entire Rosenstein hearing.
[01:37:31.156 --> 01:37:32.237]  And from, from two days,
[01:37:33.991 --> 01:37:37.074]  And I'm trying to figure this out, because this is how my mind works.
[01:37:37.214 --> 01:37:38.194]  I just want answers.
[01:37:38.315 --> 01:37:40.877]  Like, I want logic and reasoning and common sense here.
[01:37:40.937 --> 01:37:41.917]  And so I'm trying to figure this out.
[01:37:41.957 --> 01:37:48.883]  I'm like, okay, Ron Rosenstein, I mean, we're talking like six hours of testimony under oath, okay?
[01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:51.405]  You know how many questions the guy actually answered?
[01:37:52.086 --> 01:37:52.386]  None.
[01:37:52.406 --> 01:37:54.608]  I mean, none.
[01:37:56.129 --> 01:37:59.512]  And so I'm sitting here thinking, I'm like, they request these documents,
[01:38:00.848 --> 01:38:02.349]  They keep asking for these documents.
[01:38:02.389 --> 01:38:04.050]  They are well within their right to do it.
[01:38:04.150 --> 01:38:05.591]  Congress is above the FBI.
[01:38:05.871 --> 01:38:06.872]  They should get the documents.
[01:38:07.092 --> 01:38:15.637]  These oversight committees are put there so that they can go in and retrieve documents and information and intel whenever they want to maintain the integrity of the FBI.
[01:38:16.197 --> 01:38:18.819]  And somehow the FBI now is above Congress.
[01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:19.599]  That's not right.
[01:38:19.639 --> 01:38:23.481]  But Rosenstein is, you know, he can't, he says the same thing.
[01:38:24.602 --> 01:38:25.883]  We're seeking those documents.
[01:38:26.164 --> 01:38:27.345]  We're going to get you those documents.
[01:38:27.405 --> 01:38:28.286]  I've got a team of it.
[01:38:28.346 --> 01:38:29.587]  We're going to get you the documents.
[01:38:30.728 --> 01:38:40.176]  And Jim Jordan, and Trey Gowdy, and Devin Nunes, and Ron DeSantis, and they're all just like, why won't you comply with rules and procedure?
[01:38:41.177 --> 01:38:42.859]  Why won't you give us these documents?
[01:38:42.899 --> 01:38:44.721]  Why won't you present your evidence?
[01:38:45.521 --> 01:38:48.124]  But more so, why won't you give us the documents we're requesting?
[01:38:51.829 --> 01:38:52.789]  I'm trying to figure this out.
[01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:54.730]  What is going on here?
[01:38:56.091 --> 01:39:05.435]  Well, we all know they don't want the documents to be turned over that show when the spying began, who was running it, who knew who, who was colluding.
[01:39:06.035 --> 01:39:07.196]  We know they don't want that.
[01:39:07.876 --> 01:39:09.877]  But what is going on here?
[01:39:09.957 --> 01:39:12.058]  What is Rosenstein actually doing?
[01:39:13.945 --> 01:39:16.686]  Why is he telling these people, we'll get you the documents?
[01:39:17.027 --> 01:39:18.307]  Well, it's been over a year now.
[01:39:18.367 --> 01:39:19.208]  What takes you so long?
[01:39:19.808 --> 01:39:22.749]  If someone comes to me at work, I have to get documents all the time!
[01:39:22.769 --> 01:39:24.410]  I have to get legal documents?
[01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:32.214]  I mean, I'll be at home and someone will say, hey, I need to get that legal document, and I'll do whatever I can right then to get them the document.
[01:39:33.153 --> 01:39:36.976]  Or some other journalist will call me like, hey I heard you talk about this, where did you find that story, what's the source?
[01:39:37.216 --> 01:39:38.697]  And I talk to them, I get them the documents.
[01:39:39.078 --> 01:39:43.001]  So this is like, not a difficult thing to turn over documents, right?
[01:39:43.021 --> 01:39:49.946]  I mean, pretty easy thing to do, pretty standard procedure to turn over documents, but somehow Rosenstein can't figure it out.
[01:39:50.366 --> 01:39:56.511]  He's got a whole team of people, this is number two at the FBI, he doesn't even know what's going on at the FBI according to his
[01:39:57.051 --> 01:39:57.912]  Testimony under oath.
[01:39:57.932 --> 01:39:58.732]  He has no clue.
[01:39:59.032 --> 01:40:00.293]  He's trying to get the documents.
[01:40:00.333 --> 01:40:01.133]  He wants to get the documents.
[01:40:01.153 --> 01:40:01.614]  He's working on it.
[01:40:01.634 --> 01:40:02.214]  He's got a team.
[01:40:02.474 --> 01:40:03.575]  We're working on the documents.
[01:40:03.955 --> 01:40:05.356]  What is he doing?
[01:40:06.056 --> 01:40:11.199]  What is he doing, number two at the FBI, if he has no idea what's going on at the FBI and he can't even get you the documents?
[01:40:11.219 --> 01:40:13.341]  Well, what is Rosenstein doing?
[01:40:14.381 --> 01:40:15.042]  And then it hit me.
[01:40:15.962 --> 01:40:16.723]  And it's so obvious.
[01:40:17.403 --> 01:40:19.604]  They are in full-on cover your ass mode.
[01:40:19.664 --> 01:40:22.126]  Rosenstein is erasing all the documents.
[01:40:22.406 --> 01:40:23.867]  And then, oh my gosh, where's the story?
[01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:28.950]  Oh, it's here in the stack of news somewhere, I know it.
[01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:36.132]  The NSA, magically, ladies and gentlemen, just had a massive, a massive loss of data.
[01:40:36.512 --> 01:40:38.333]  I can't find the story in my stack of news here.
[01:40:40.254 --> 01:40:45.416]  Oh, magically, the NSA has a huge loss of data.
[01:40:45.436 --> 01:40:50.997]  Yeah, I can't, of course I can't find the news story now.
[01:40:51.718 --> 01:40:52.838]  Maybe you guys can pull it up.
[01:40:53.438 --> 01:40:55.059]  It was on the Drudge Report earlier.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:57.861]  Let's see if I can find this.
[01:40:59.422 --> 01:41:02.565]  Anyway, does that have to do with it?
[01:41:04.466 --> 01:41:04.887]  Here we go.
[01:41:04.907 --> 01:41:10.351]  NSA deletes scores of call records over technical irregularities.
[01:41:11.012 --> 01:41:12.273]  Oh, I'm sure.
[01:41:13.034 --> 01:41:15.336]  Right after the Rosenstein testimony.
[01:41:15.987 --> 01:41:21.110]  There's an NSA error with technical irregularities while they're pulling all the texts.
[01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:22.731]  They're pulling all the data.
[01:41:22.771 --> 01:41:24.012]  They're pulling all the emails.
[01:41:24.092 --> 01:41:24.772]  You've seen it.
[01:41:24.832 --> 01:41:25.973]  They're clearly colluding.
[01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:27.574]  They're clearly meddling in the election.
[01:41:27.974 --> 01:41:29.535]  Now they're going after the phone calls.
[01:41:29.575 --> 01:41:31.056]  Congress wants to hear what they're talking about.
[01:41:31.436 --> 01:41:35.439]  And the NSA magically deletes scores of call records.
[01:41:35.799 --> 01:41:36.619]  Magically!
[01:41:36.639 --> 01:41:39.041]  I wonder if any of those were Obama's calls.
[01:41:39.061 --> 01:41:41.722]  I'm just wondering.
[01:41:41.742 --> 01:41:42.383]  Just a question.
[01:41:43.583 --> 01:41:44.344]  Just a question.
[01:41:45.401 --> 01:41:50.706]  I wonder if any of that deleted data by the NSA, I wonder if Rosenstein has anything to do with that.
[01:41:51.186 --> 01:41:53.048]  I'm just wondering, I don't know.
[01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:55.710]  One can just ask questions, right?
[01:41:57.112 --> 01:42:02.657]  What is Rosenstein doing over the course of a year while searching for documents but can't present them?
[01:42:03.632 --> 01:42:04.452]  He's seeking them.
[01:42:04.472 --> 01:42:05.132]  He's got a team.
[01:42:05.172 --> 01:42:06.113]  He said it under oath.
[01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:06.873]  He's seeking them.
[01:42:06.913 --> 01:42:07.533]  He has a team.
[01:42:08.473 --> 01:42:09.734]  What's taking him so long?
[01:42:09.814 --> 01:42:14.495]  And then, why does the NSA delete scores of call records over technical irregularities?
[01:42:14.515 --> 01:42:15.555]  Is there a connection here?
[01:42:15.915 --> 01:42:17.215]  Am I missing something?
[01:42:18.336 --> 01:42:19.896]  What are all these people covering for?
[01:42:19.996 --> 01:42:21.557]  What is Stroke covering for?
[01:42:22.157 --> 01:42:24.817]  What is Rosenstein covering for?
[01:42:24.897 --> 01:42:26.418]  What is Comey covering for?
[01:42:28.798 --> 01:42:28.959]  Hmm.
[01:42:30.659 --> 01:42:30.779]  Hmm.
[01:42:32.558 --> 01:42:44.748]  Usually there's someone sitting at the top of all this and everyone's kind of covering up the, you know, the Don, if you will, the head gangster, the guy responsible for making all the calls.
[01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:47.170]  Who could these people be protecting?
[01:42:48.571 --> 01:42:51.854]  Who's gone silent over the last year?
[01:42:53.535 --> 01:42:54.536]  Could it be Obama?
[01:42:54.636 --> 01:42:56.537]  Could Obama be the one behind all of this?
[01:42:56.638 --> 01:42:59.700]  Obama who lied about Hillary Clinton's private illegal server?
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:00.561]  Could it be Obama?
[01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:16.974]  A few years ago, ideas that we talked about were thought to be fringe ideas, radical ideas, extremist ideas.
[01:43:16.994 --> 01:43:19.556]  Those ideas are now mainstream.
[01:43:19.836 --> 01:43:23.378]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country.
[01:43:23.478 --> 01:43:34.565]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get up and you create a crowd!
[01:43:42.408 --> 01:43:46.170]  Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless c***.
[01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:50.412]  What's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women?
[01:43:50.612 --> 01:43:55.054]  One way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy, so please, bring on the recession.
[01:43:55.194 --> 01:43:58.976]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a prisoner?
[01:43:59.156 --> 01:44:03.798]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[01:44:09.332 --> 01:44:13.635]  It has been said that the Republican Party's testicles just dropped.
[01:44:14.595 --> 01:44:17.637]  That wasn't an Infowars.com ad you just saw.
[01:44:17.978 --> 01:44:20.099]  That was officially put out by the Republican Party.
[01:44:20.779 --> 01:44:34.128]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're finally getting the fact that the globalists are trying to start a violent revolution in this country and overthrow it and bring it down just like Venezuela and so many others that have fallen to socialism and communism.
[01:44:34.508 --> 01:44:39.292]  The globalists recognize that InfoWars has been on the very front lines of this global awakening.
[01:44:39.692 --> 01:44:48.138]  And they don't want us to be there as this fight intensifies to continue to rally free humans all over the planet against this diabolical globalist program.
[01:44:48.419 --> 01:44:55.584]  That's why it's more critical than ever that you understand that we are not supported by George Soros or any big banks or any big corporations.
[01:44:55.964 --> 01:45:01.589]  We are supported by you, the viewers, and the listeners that buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:05.394]  We need to be re-provisioned in this fight.
[01:45:05.754 --> 01:45:07.497]  We need to be able to fund our operation.
[01:45:08.058 --> 01:45:18.492]  And we make it easy with products like Super Blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, mouthwash, immune gargle, and so much more, fortified with colloil silver.

[01:45:41.729 --> 01:45:45.831]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, this is where you finance
[01:45:46.741 --> 01:45:57.230]  The second American revolution with the United States now attempting to stop the global government empire, attempting to take back control of our destiny on a global scale.
[01:46:02.654 --> 01:46:04.976]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:46:04.996 --> 01:46:06.738]  We're really, really proud of it.

[01:46:48.933 --> 01:46:51.736]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[01:46:51.956 --> 01:46:53.337]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:46:53.977 --> 01:46:56.539]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.241]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:46:59.822 --> 01:47:02.144]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[01:47:06.167 --> 01:47:08.789]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:15.211 --> 01:47:22.236]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[01:47:22.296 --> 01:47:24.478]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:47:24.518 --> 01:47:25.919]  We love the American people.
[01:47:37.128 --> 01:47:39.329]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:47:39.349 --> 01:47:40.830]  We love the American people.
[01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:42.232]  We love the American people.
[01:47:44.384 --> 01:47:45.885]  We love the American people.
[01:47:46.586 --> 01:48:00.237]  They came in peace.
[01:48:00.377 --> 01:48:02.759]  But we are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:48:02.779 --> 01:48:03.699]  We love the American people.
[01:48:03.719 --> 01:48:04.100]  This is CNN.
[01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:31.622]  I'm going to say something that is probably one of the most often said things in history.
[01:48:32.603 --> 01:48:36.805]  In every time, in every culture, since we've had the recorded word.
[01:48:37.506 --> 01:48:44.430]  Or since we could carve hieroglyphs on the sides of cave and then temple walls.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.081]  We do what we do for our children.
[01:48:49.863 --> 01:48:50.744]  But who are our children?
[01:48:51.384 --> 01:49:13.702]  They are the genetic expression of all of our ancestors together, integrated through our life and our experiences with another human, splicing that complex history of compressed
[01:49:15.726 --> 01:49:20.410]  Knowledge and information together and creating a new being.
[01:49:22.312 --> 01:49:29.639]  My little 14-month-old daughter, just as I left the house just a few minutes ago, was squealing, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, I love you, Daddy, Daddy.
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:31.961]  She's very, very verbal.
[01:49:33.743 --> 01:49:36.145]  Talks about like a three-year-old, probably two-and-a-half-year-old.
[01:49:36.385 --> 01:49:36.986]  It's amazing.
[01:49:37.626 --> 01:49:38.447]  Knows hundreds of words.
[01:49:42.558 --> 01:50:04.751]  I had forgotten this cell phone, this little surveillance gadget, so I drove off, came back, walked back in the house, and she had her hands up while she was sitting there in her hot chair eating, up at the sky, just completely, joyfully, happy, singing, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
[01:50:06.832 --> 01:50:08.573]  And when she looked down and saw that I was back,
[01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:13.390]  She just began squealing with joy.
[01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:15.170]  And then seething.
[01:50:16.231 --> 01:50:17.551]  I even got some video of it.
[01:50:17.951 --> 01:50:22.632]  It was so amazing, her rubbing her hands together, just like she just won the Super Bowl.
[01:50:24.293 --> 01:50:30.815]  That's the joy of human life, and that little creature is the seed of the universe, to quote Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:50:31.835 --> 01:50:37.737]  And to think about how the transhumanists that came out of the Eugenics Society after World War II,
[01:50:39.969 --> 01:51:05.574]  Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley, openly wrote books and plans to create an artificial global system to break up the family, to basically end the entire human experience as it's been, and to really end our humanity itself, and create a permanent caste system of suboid.
[01:51:05.735 --> 01:51:07.615]  That's the word he and others actually use.
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:31.097]  Suboid minions to permanently institutionalize the so-called ruling class, the predator class, the alpha maggot classes, rule over humanity in some twisted form of social Darwin, social Darwinistic experiment.
[01:51:32.298 --> 01:51:33.399]  And that's really what we face.
[01:51:33.439 --> 01:51:34.759]  That's what the global government's about.
[01:51:34.799 --> 01:51:37.160]  It's what all the transgenderism is about.
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:44.464]  It has nothing to do with a man that wants to be a woman, or a woman that wants to be a man, or maybe has proclivities, because both sexes have similarities to the others.
[01:51:45.084 --> 01:51:46.104]  And that's gone on forever.
[01:51:46.905 --> 01:51:57.690]  It is to take that as a set case point, and then standardize it to where no one can even criticize it, when it's being taught to young children to confuse them, sexualize them, and really abuse them.
[01:52:00.433 --> 01:52:13.967]  It is to take that and set the precedent for any and all forms of transhumanism, even carried out by corporations and governments, saying you can't even debate or discuss those new aberrations.
[01:52:16.589 --> 01:52:22.976]  And it's the same thing we see with chimeras and the cross-species
[01:52:24.810 --> 01:52:27.771]  Creations, and I predicted this a decade ago and now they're doing it.
[01:52:28.192 --> 01:52:33.554]  They're saying soon robots and machines will have rights as part of this mental illness.
[01:52:34.234 --> 01:52:52.103]  Because if they can get you to accept that you're a beautiful ornate building or a dragonette, like Google executives make their employees accept, whether you identify as a blind person so the government psychiatrist comes by and dumps Drano in your eyes and the taxpayer pays for you, if they can convince the public to accept people identifying as a fire hydrant,
[01:52:53.288 --> 01:52:53.688]  I think so.
[01:53:14.745 --> 01:53:41.378]  Which they've removed into the government now, which they've removed from the charities and the churches, and which they've now endowed into the priesthood and the government and the corporate systems and the corporate gurus and the university gurus, who then give you all these faux imaginary rights and faux imaginary authorizations for aberration against the entire human experience.
[01:53:42.995 --> 01:53:45.896]  And that is admittedly to undermine society and bring it down.
[01:53:45.916 --> 01:53:48.278]  And the globalists are becoming more and more honest about this.
[01:53:48.298 --> 01:53:57.542]  One of the top academics in England just came out a few weeks ago and said, the family is bad, we're trying to destroy it, and we should celebrate that the nuclear family is 70% annihilated in the UK.
[01:53:59.963 --> 01:54:01.704]  And similar statements here in the US.
[01:54:01.744 --> 01:54:05.866]  This has been taught in their textbooks forever.
[01:54:07.647 --> 01:54:09.668]  But imagine, they bring people in
[01:54:10.845 --> 01:54:11.085]  I think?
[01:54:34.895 --> 01:54:50.428]  And many people get depressed about it and pull out of it and, you know, leave college or change what their major is, but a lot of people decide, through successive approximation, to accept the commission into the global system to actually work against the human species itself.
[01:54:52.009 --> 01:54:57.714]  Now, by the 50s, this idea was sold in that humans were too successful on the planet and didn't have any natural predators.
[01:54:57.734 --> 01:55:01.637]  And that war had become too destructive to manage our numbers.
[01:55:04.192 --> 01:55:12.554]  And so they would then bring in artificial systems to poison us, to dumb us down, to play us off against each other.
[01:55:14.046 --> 01:55:14.687]  To control us.
[01:55:14.767 --> 01:55:17.988]  But all that's done is create a brain drain and cause even bigger crises.
[01:55:18.509 --> 01:55:24.332]  So it is a fact they put hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water, aka fluoride, to brain damage you and lower your fertility.
[01:55:24.712 --> 01:55:29.054]  It is a fact they took iodine out of the salt to lower your fertility and IQ.
[01:55:29.074 --> 01:55:29.414]  Look it up.
[01:55:29.855 --> 01:55:31.376]  That's Harvard Studies.
[01:55:31.856 --> 01:55:34.377]  It is a fact that the IQs are plummeting.
[01:55:34.737 --> 01:55:36.818]  It is a fact that cancer is skyrocketing.
[01:55:37.239 --> 01:55:42.802]  It is a fact that everywhere that glyphosate is used, breast cancer goes up 3,000 plus percent.
[01:55:43.402 --> 01:55:57.494]  Just a decade after Brazil introduced glyphosate, a decade after Brazil introduced glyphosate, they saw ultra-massive increases in breast cancer that basically hadn't existed in the country before.
[01:55:58.895 --> 01:56:11.766]  Look, I know all of you who've researched this know it's true, but we've really got a job to reach out to other people and understand that they knew 3G was frying us and giving us cancer and doubling brain tumors, and now 5G's many times more powerful.
[01:56:12.628 --> 01:56:14.150]  We are being killed.
[01:56:15.131 --> 01:56:27.266]  And the fact that it's all admitted they're doing it, and that we do nothing, the social engineers say the contract has been fulfilled, because under their weird metaphysical rules, they have to tell you what they're doing to you.
[01:56:27.286 --> 01:56:30.150]  They have to put the warning on the cigarette pack.
[01:56:32.193 --> 01:56:33.874]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:34.975 --> 01:56:52.247]  I want to hand the baton back to Owen Troyer doing a great job today taking care of operations here a little bit on the road and I've got another big report coming up from some interesting tidbits of information I got going on on the upcoming departure of Mr. Kelly as the
[01:56:54.375 --> 01:56:55.436]  Chief of Staff for the President.
[01:56:55.456 --> 01:57:00.918]  I don't really get that focused on shake-ups on staff because Trump really is his own man.
[01:57:01.999 --> 01:57:04.640]  And normally staff does control what the President does.
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:06.901]  It's just as important as the old President in many cases.
[01:57:06.981 --> 01:57:08.102]  But that's not the case.
[01:57:08.142 --> 01:57:11.023]  He's become ceremonial and we've got some different folks in the running.
[01:57:11.043 --> 01:57:16.046]  So I'm going to give you my two cents from some of my inside information on what's unfolding.
[01:57:16.106 --> 01:57:17.707]  And a lot of people would like Hope Hicks.
[01:57:18.727 --> 01:57:21.869]  They believe will actually implement what Trump wants in there.
[01:57:22.689 --> 01:57:28.692]  But there's also some other folks that have proven themselves very, very able, got the tax cuts through and things like that, that Trump's looking at as well.
[01:57:28.953 --> 01:57:31.134]  So that is coming up today.
[01:57:31.834 --> 01:57:33.075]  Just please remember your children.
[01:57:33.815 --> 01:57:37.920]  Please remember what we're fighting for, and understand that there's a globalist elite that believe we're animals.
[01:57:38.361 --> 01:57:43.267]  They're treating us as such, and we need to stop acting like we're dumb animals, and move forward, which is starting to happen.
[01:57:43.507 --> 01:57:45.650]  Alright, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:57:46.190 --> 01:57:49.475]  Next year's news today, the future of humanity.
[01:57:52.210 --> 01:57:59.191]  Every week we're going to be profiling a different TV station, TV network, or cable station or network that's picking up InfoWars.
[01:57:59.611 --> 01:58:06.012]  We're on well over a hundred stations right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago.
[01:58:06.653 --> 01:58:12.474]  Now, one TV station that's actually been picking us up for several years that I want to profile first is Phonoscope.
[01:58:13.554 --> 01:58:20.295]  Phonoscope's creator and owner is the man that invented, more than 50, 60 years ago, streaming
[01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:22.774]  Television over phone lines.
[01:58:23.054 --> 01:58:25.215]  That's why it's called Phonoscope and why it's patented.
[01:58:25.715 --> 01:58:31.577]  Well, he's got several channels and stations in Houston, and he's got us on 24 hours a day.
[01:58:32.557 --> 01:58:36.958]  On Phonoscope, channel 9 in Houston cable systems.
[01:58:37.558 --> 01:58:41.819]  So, we're talking a potential of 6 million people that are able to tune in.
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:43.600]  This is very, very exciting.
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:47.301]  So to all of our listeners online, even if you're not in Houston,
[01:58:48.261 --> 01:59:09.457]  Be sure and tell any friends, family, or neighbors, or folks that you know who live in the Houston area, they can tune in to Cable Channel 9 to Phonoscope, not just for my four-hour broadcast every day from our state-of-the-art TV and radio studios here in Austin, but to Owen Schroer, David Knight, and all the other shows and all the other news and anchors and analysis that we're adding.
[01:59:09.918 --> 01:59:12.580]  So, Phonoscope is our oldest TV affiliate.
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:17.063]  They've been picking us up, I guess, for four years now, and so we really appreciate them.
[01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:19.145]  They're also one of our biggest, massive response.
[01:59:19.585 --> 01:59:35.377]  So to Lee Cook and the entire family down there at Phonoscope, we salute you, and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show and listeners of my show to tune into Phonoscope and to also visit their website so you can find out about some of the other programs they put out, like Ron Paul's TV show.
[01:59:35.937 --> 01:59:36.278]  So again,
[01:59:36.778 --> 01:59:41.763]  From myself and the entire InfoWars crew in Austin, Texas, we salute Phonoscope in Houston.
[01:59:42.283 --> 01:59:43.785]  Thanks for all you're doing for this republic.
[01:59:44.065 --> 01:59:45.667]  You've helped make America great again.
[01:59:47.108 --> 01:59:51.092]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:56.057 --> 02:00:00.021]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:18.974 --> 02:00:26.920]  You know, the hypocrisy and the doublethink from the Democrats right now is honestly, it's like they outdo themselves every day.
[02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:28.321]  It's really amazing.
[02:00:29.762 --> 02:00:33.644]  You've got Chris, Kilzeala, Sezilla.
[02:00:34.704 --> 02:00:35.164]  Who cares?
[02:00:35.304 --> 02:00:42.868]  Anyway, he works for CNN, and he has the headline, Donald Trump is pretty sure he's nailing this whole president thing.
[02:00:43.269 --> 02:00:44.209]  Oh yeah, Chris.
[02:00:44.969 --> 02:00:46.150]  He's pretty sure, all right.
[02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:53.674]  You know, just record jobs growth, record low unemployment, record stock markets, confidence at an all-time high.
[02:00:54.114 --> 02:00:57.516]  He goes to any city, he gets 10,000 people to show up for a rally.
[02:00:58.077 --> 02:01:02.459]  Yeah, I think you could say he's nailing the presidency thing.
[02:01:04.431 --> 02:01:07.252]  But they put it out there like, oh, look at arrogant Trump.
[02:01:07.292 --> 02:01:08.532]  He thinks he's doing a good job.
[02:01:09.152 --> 02:01:10.132]  Obviously he's not.
[02:01:10.332 --> 02:01:10.972]  We said so.
[02:01:13.273 --> 02:01:15.013]  You're losers, CNN.
[02:01:15.974 --> 02:01:19.334]  You get outrated by the Food Network now.
[02:01:22.635 --> 02:01:26.856]  Donald Trump is pretty sure he's nailing this whole presidency thing is.
[02:01:27.916 --> 02:01:29.077]  Yeah, he is.
[02:01:32.642 --> 02:01:37.745]  Like the correct sarcastic headline would be for Trump, or excuse me, for Obama.
[02:01:38.546 --> 02:01:42.989]  Obama sure thinks he's nailing this whole president thing when he was a total abject failure.
[02:01:43.529 --> 02:01:45.150]  Trump is actually doing it.
[02:01:45.711 --> 02:01:46.972]  You know what he's doing more than anything though?
[02:01:47.132 --> 02:01:48.132]  He's proving to you
[02:01:49.093 --> 02:01:52.677]  That these career politicians are nothing but phonies and frauds.
[02:01:53.257 --> 02:01:54.539]  That's what he's honestly proving.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.863]  That is the biggest thing of all that people need to understand.
[02:01:59.223 --> 02:02:01.346]  Trump is just a real American citizen.
[02:02:01.566 --> 02:02:01.946]  Think about it.
[02:02:02.307 --> 02:02:04.809]  What do any of these people accomplish in the real world?
[02:02:04.889 --> 02:02:07.352]  What have any of these people accomplished in the private sector?
[02:02:07.612 --> 02:02:09.174]  What was Obama's accomplishments?
[02:02:09.454 --> 02:02:12.117]  List, first of all, you can't even list Obama's accomplishments
[02:02:13.376 --> 02:02:15.237]  From being a president, honestly.
[02:02:15.577 --> 02:02:18.399]  Can you list an Obama accomplishment from the private sector?
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:18.820]  No.
[02:02:20.261 --> 02:02:22.922]  Here's another example of their double-think, double-standard.
[02:02:23.083 --> 02:02:29.047]  They're now saying Trump should not be allowed to appoint a Supreme Court justice.
[02:02:29.949 --> 02:02:31.611]  Because he's under investigation.
[02:02:31.751 --> 02:02:35.695]  Ladies and gentlemen, they wanted Hillary Clinton to run for president while she was under investigation.
[02:02:35.996 --> 02:02:43.484]  So Trump can't appoint a Supreme Court justice, which is his job, his duty, his mandate, as the president, duly elected.
[02:02:43.884 --> 02:02:46.327]  He's not allowed to do that because he's under a fake investigation.
[02:02:46.627 --> 02:02:49.871]  Hillary Clinton, under a real investigation, they wanted her to be president.
[02:02:51.246 --> 02:02:53.709]  Again, this is the double standard of the phony left.
[02:02:53.949 --> 02:02:54.750]  Let's go to another one now.
[02:02:54.791 --> 02:02:55.752]  Let's go to clip 17.
[02:02:55.792 --> 02:02:59.677]  You won't believe the hypocrisy coming out of Kamala Harris in this clip.
[02:03:01.138 --> 02:03:02.599]  What's the court going to look like for the next 30 years?
[02:03:02.619 --> 02:03:10.965]  We're looking at a destruction of the Constitution of the United States, as far as I can tell, based on all of the folks that he's been appointing thus far for lifetime appointments.
[02:03:11.305 --> 02:03:13.107]  He's been appointing ideologues.
[02:03:13.207 --> 02:03:18.310]  He has been appointing people who have refused to agree that Brown v. Board of Education is settled law.
[02:03:18.370 --> 02:03:23.314]  He has been appointing people who haven't even been found to be well qualified or even qualified by our associations.
[02:03:23.334 --> 02:03:23.614]  That's absurd.
[02:03:23.634 --> 02:03:24.295]  These are all absurd claims.
[02:03:24.955 --> 02:03:31.918]  So this has got to be one of, and we all need to understand this, to be one of the most serious fights that we have yet to have.
[02:03:31.938 --> 02:03:33.418]  Stoking the flames of fighting again.
[02:03:33.498 --> 02:03:34.939]  And we cannot relent.
[02:03:35.399 --> 02:03:45.003]  We are going to have to fight to the end to make sure that we can do anything and everything that is possible to require this president to choose a consensus pick.
[02:03:45.923 --> 02:03:46.884]  Talk to Democrats.
[02:03:47.565 --> 02:03:48.907]  The position's going to be filled.
[02:03:49.487 --> 02:03:54.232]  But with the track record that he has demonstrated so far, it does not look good.
[02:03:54.513 --> 02:04:03.763]  And so we're going to have to put all the pressure that we possibly can to make sure that the person who fills Kennedy's seat is someone who is a consensus pick and who's going to respect the Constitution of the United States and respect
[02:04:03.943 --> 02:04:05.625]  Respect the Constitution.
[02:04:06.065 --> 02:04:08.407]  He can't say that without choking on it.
[02:04:08.447 --> 02:04:10.128]  Let me tell you something about Kamala Harris.
[02:04:10.148 --> 02:04:12.530]  This is one of the most wicked, wicked women.
[02:04:12.951 --> 02:04:14.212]  She wants to be the next Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:14.232 --> 02:04:16.113]  She wants to be the next Wicked Witch of the West.
[02:04:16.413 --> 02:04:17.474]  Disgusting, that woman.
[02:04:17.875 --> 02:04:18.855]  Such an evil liar.
[02:04:19.376 --> 02:04:19.836]  Think about it.
[02:04:20.457 --> 02:04:22.478]  She says we're looking at the destruction of the U.S.
[02:04:22.518 --> 02:04:23.059]  Constitution.
[02:04:23.779 --> 02:04:26.562]  Since when have these people cared about the Constitution?
[02:04:28.143 --> 02:04:29.664]  I thought we were the bitter clingers.
[02:04:29.824 --> 02:04:31.646]  I thought the Constitution was old hat.
[02:04:31.986 --> 02:04:35.749]  Now they've completely changed their message because it's anything anti-Trump.
[02:04:38.814 --> 02:04:40.115]  But here's the craziest part.
[02:04:40.175 --> 02:04:44.257]  If you look at the decisions that they support, they're all against the Constitution.
[02:04:44.457 --> 02:04:45.598]  Look at Trump vs. Hawaii.
[02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:51.060]  They wanted one judge in Hawaii to have more power than the President of the United States.
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.961]  Do you know how unconstitutional that is?
[02:04:53.242 --> 02:04:56.903]  That's what they want, and then they say that Trump's unconstitutional.
[02:04:56.943 --> 02:04:59.605]  I mean, the double think here is we are in 1984.
[02:04:59.645 --> 02:05:00.445]  We are in Orwell's world.
[02:05:04.065 --> 02:05:08.426]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:05:08.906 --> 02:05:17.829]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:05:18.369 --> 02:05:22.930]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[02:05:23.170 --> 02:05:33.473]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[02:05:33.473 --> 02:05:34.213]  We're good to go.
[02:05:34.233 --> 02:05:34.913]  I think?
[02:06:06.929 --> 02:06:09.090]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:09.570 --> 02:06:15.913]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:16.013 --> 02:06:22.595]  He was elected to unite a country and stop slavery.
[02:06:23.496 --> 02:06:28.598]  Democrats smeared him, went to war against him, assassinated him.
[02:06:29.438 --> 02:06:30.919]  Now, their target is Trump.
[02:06:35.823 --> 02:06:39.067]  Donald Trump wins the presidency, so help me God.
[02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:43.913]  They say he's killing America.
[02:06:43.933 --> 02:06:46.356]  There will be a vote to impeach.
[02:06:46.436 --> 02:06:47.597]  They say he's a racist.
[02:06:47.617 --> 02:06:49.299]  This was a white lash.
[02:06:49.439 --> 02:06:50.240]  And a fascist.
[02:06:51.428 --> 02:06:53.530]  Who are the real racists?
[02:06:53.791 --> 02:07:01.899]  Northern Democrats had conspired together with Southern Democrats to take away the fruit of other people's labor.
[02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:03.902]  Who are the real fascists?
[02:07:11.337 --> 02:07:15.439]  Both Mussolini and Hitler set up and ran welfare systems.
[02:07:15.499 --> 02:07:20.241]  This was done by the do-gooders, the liberals, the people who wanted to improve society.
[02:07:20.321 --> 02:07:22.102]  Which party attacks our free speech?
[02:07:22.142 --> 02:07:25.484]  How dare you speak against the people?
[02:07:25.504 --> 02:07:32.187]  Our religious liberty and our personal safety?
[02:07:32.287 --> 02:07:34.748]  A nation dies when its people are not free.
[02:07:36.803 --> 02:07:41.508]  We too must fight for freedom, regardless of the price we pay.
[02:07:42.809 --> 02:07:47.114]  An end in terror is preferable to a terror with no end.
[02:07:47.534 --> 02:07:49.016]  The stakes could not be higher.
[02:07:49.256 --> 02:07:52.399]  We're talking about America, the greatest nation on earth.
[02:07:54.201 --> 02:07:59.406]  Lincoln saved America for the first time.
[02:08:03.527 --> 02:08:06.750]  It's now up to us to save America a second time.
[02:08:13.976 --> 02:08:28.749]  It's very clear that Dinesh D'Souza, best-selling author, top documentary filmmaker, former political prisoner, recently pardoned by the president, and overall American success story, is preparing to do it yet again.
[02:08:30.481 --> 02:08:45.246]  Of course, the name of the film is a play on words because you had the classic pro-KKK silent movie, Birth of a Nation, which is about the very ethos of the Democratic Party and what it did after the Civil War with the KKK.
[02:08:45.927 --> 02:08:49.428]  And so their greatest hoax is projecting
[02:08:50.208 --> 02:08:57.755]  During the 1960s on to Republicans, that they were the party of the KKK, that they were the party that was for slavery.
[02:08:58.155 --> 02:09:05.822]  They were able to turn reality on its head and that's why this film is further coffin nails to the Democratic Party.
[02:09:06.223 --> 02:09:08.084]  They knew the film was in development years ago.
[02:09:08.104 --> 02:09:11.748]  That's one reason Hillary Clinton moved to have Dinesh D'Souza put in
[02:09:12.128 --> 02:09:15.070]  Prison for campaign finance violations.
[02:09:15.630 --> 02:09:27.616]  But now, back from the dead, rising like the phoenix, this film, set to reach hundreds of millions of people, is going to lay out the devastating facts that Trump, just like Lincoln, is trying to unify the country.
[02:09:27.636 --> 02:09:30.998]  Trump, just like Lincoln, is a Republican.
[02:09:31.498 --> 02:09:36.101]  And Trump, just like Lincoln, is under threat of murder, threat of violent attack.
[02:09:37.181 --> 02:09:40.302]  By the Democratic Party and the power structures that it's sold out to.
[02:09:40.542 --> 02:09:42.463]  Because the truth is, the real reason U.S.
[02:09:42.503 --> 02:09:49.545]  intelligence agencies and major corporations are behind Trump is they realize that the Communist Chinese are the main dominant force.
[02:09:50.645 --> 02:09:55.427]  Basically taking this country over, not just the Democratic Party, but through large sections of the Republican Party.
[02:09:56.127 --> 02:10:10.544]  And that's why they're so desperate, because as all this becomes to come out, they're trying to project again onto Russian collusion that doesn't exist to cover up the multinational collusion with Communist China through major corporations like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and others.
[02:10:11.204 --> 02:10:12.505]  So I can't wait to see the film.
[02:10:12.525 --> 02:10:17.949]  Clearly there were more complex issues from the North and South than just lionizing Lincoln as if he was this perfect character.
[02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:27.196]  But the parallels are true that the nation was at a defining moment that could have easily destroyed it if Lincoln hadn't done what he did.
[02:10:27.757 --> 02:10:29.238]  This country would have been split in two.
[02:10:29.878 --> 02:10:35.843]  British intelligence was funding the South, was manipulating real grievances that they'd had that President
[02:10:36.923 --> 02:10:40.065]  Jackson was able to stop a few decades before.
[02:10:40.605 --> 02:10:49.430]  So the South was then manipulated into splitting the country in two under promises of British intelligence that they would then back the South in Western expansion.
[02:10:49.770 --> 02:10:52.492]  As soon as the war was actually started, though, it was used to destabilize.
[02:10:52.752 --> 02:11:04.779]  Tens of thousands of British troops were put in Toronto, threatening an invasion, and were waiting for the Northern government to actually fall so they could then come in and recolonize the nation, perhaps making a deal with the South,
[02:11:05.199 --> 02:11:05.539]  Yes, we are.
[02:11:35.519 --> 02:11:50.630]  So, again, can't wait to get Dinesh D'Souza back on the broadcast, can't wait to see this film hit the theaters and be a number one documentary, and can't wait to see history victorious over the globalists and their main attempt to break up this republic.
[02:11:50.971 --> 02:11:52.612]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:11:52.652 --> 02:11:54.533]  Now back to Owen Schroer and the live transmission.
[02:11:57.967 --> 02:12:11.856]  What Dinesh D'Souza is able to do in these films so coherently getting a message of truth out there and using history to really pound it home and of course what happens to him he becomes a political prisoner.
[02:12:13.365 --> 02:12:17.068]  Rosie O'Donnell is allowed to do what Dinesh D'Souza did, actually a lot worse.
[02:12:17.148 --> 02:12:20.070]  Rosie O'Donnell did it deceptively with pseudonyms.
[02:12:20.110 --> 02:12:30.839]  So Rosie O'Donnell broke multiple laws for campaign finance violations, but Dinesh D'Souza is like a drop in a bucket, like nothing, and he faces the fullest extent of the law.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:32.260]  Why?
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:39.065]  Because Dinesh D'Souza makes powerful films exposing the globalists and their agenda to bring America down.
[02:12:39.585 --> 02:12:40.907]  Dinesh D'Souza, of course,
[02:12:42.028 --> 02:12:46.772]  Hillary's America, Obama's America, and America, imagine a world without her.
[02:12:46.972 --> 02:12:51.316]  Those are Dinesh D'Souza's films, and now the latest death of a nation.
[02:12:52.297 --> 02:13:08.511]  And it's funny, listening to this, just two days ago, I believe it was Tuesday, Michael Savage hinted at, and I believe it was tongue-in-cheek, I don't think he was serious, producing a Trump film.
[02:13:09.457 --> 02:13:10.277]  Now think about this.
[02:13:10.738 --> 02:13:11.938]  Hollywood's collapsing.
[02:13:13.279 --> 02:13:18.681]  Box office winners at the movie theater are really not happening anymore.
[02:13:18.741 --> 02:13:24.084]  You had the Avengers and you have Star Wars, but other than that, you really don't get much success.
[02:13:24.144 --> 02:13:35.910]  In fact, Star Wars has actually decided to curtail its movie productions, as far as the Star Wars brand is concerned, because nobody went and saw Solo.
[02:13:35.970 --> 02:13:37.630]  So nobody's going to see these films anymore.
[02:13:37.650 --> 02:13:38.711]  Nobody's going to the movie theater.
[02:13:40.905 --> 02:13:44.186]  But what would draw people back to the movie theater?
[02:13:44.206 --> 02:13:52.669]  And it sucks that you have to boycott Hollywood because of their anti-American rhetoric, and then, you know, the good people in Hollywood suffered, the movie theater people suffer.
[02:13:53.570 --> 02:13:54.750]  But what could save all that?
[02:13:54.930 --> 02:13:58.211]  Imagine if someone produced a Trump movie.
[02:13:59.092 --> 02:14:01.112]  A legitimate Trump film.
[02:14:01.392 --> 02:14:08.035]  It could be documentary style, it could be, you know, an actor portraying Trump coming up in the 70s and 80s and everything.
[02:14:08.939 --> 02:14:25.324]  But if you did a Trump movie, a Trump film, that was fair, a real film, not a hit piece, but a real Donald Trump, I mean, the guy is the epitome of the American dream, a real film on Donald Trump, that would be box office records.
[02:14:26.924 --> 02:14:29.105]  I mean, look at what the guy does at a rally.
[02:14:30.424 --> 02:14:33.806]  Tens of thousands of people show up at his rallies.
[02:14:33.846 --> 02:14:36.087]  They would show up at the movie theaters, folks.
[02:14:36.747 --> 02:14:39.569]  It would be a nationwide phenomenon.
[02:14:40.129 --> 02:14:41.990]  A lot like the passion of the Christ, I would imagine.
[02:14:43.305 --> 02:14:47.566]  Just to compare them as far as their power of the film.
[02:14:48.607 --> 02:14:51.908]  Just like a bunch of people came out to see The Passion of the Christ for two reasons.
[02:14:52.148 --> 02:14:59.710]  One, nobody had really done that mainstream Hollywood movie about Jesus and the crucifixion before.
[02:15:00.170 --> 02:15:04.612]  And then two, there was all this controversy surrounding it, so it basically just got free marketing.
[02:15:05.899 --> 02:15:10.385]  You would have the exact same dynamic if you did a fair film on President Trump.
[02:15:11.046 --> 02:15:16.794]  Alex, if you're listening right now, I maybe reach out to Michael Savage and maybe try to bring this deal to fruition.
[02:15:17.394 --> 02:15:21.740]  I'm telling you, this is a winner, winner, winner, chicken dinner.
[02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:33.504]  And if you got Savage behind it, Jones behind it, who knows, maybe even get a Limbaugh behind it, some other big-name conservatives, you put that thing in theaters, you're talking box office records.
[02:15:33.824 --> 02:15:37.165]  You're talking lines at the movie theater that you haven't seen before.
[02:15:38.566 --> 02:15:43.407]  Trump the movie in theaters would beat every other Hollywood film that's coming out.
[02:15:43.767 --> 02:15:46.668]  You know, Peter Fonda's movie grossed $30,000.
[02:15:53.705 --> 02:15:58.649]  Oh, you know, Peter Fonda and Tom Arnold call for Barron Trump to be kidnapped and harassed.
[02:15:58.789 --> 02:15:59.469]  What happens to them?
[02:15:59.509 --> 02:16:00.250]  They're losers.
[02:16:09.337 --> 02:16:12.339]  What do you want to do with your life?
[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:13.801]  I want to rock.
[02:16:16.883 --> 02:16:19.005]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour,
[02:16:20.051 --> 02:16:21.873]  You're gonna see some serious s***.
[02:16:21.893 --> 02:16:28.319]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:16:33.891 --> 02:16:38.353]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[02:16:39.473 --> 02:16:46.076]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[02:16:46.356 --> 02:16:54.720]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:57.801]  All right, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[02:16:58.993 --> 02:17:01.775]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[02:17:01.915 --> 02:17:10.360]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:15.863]  To work to erase national boundaries and create an international community.
[02:17:16.343 --> 02:17:21.506]  And, in time, bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[02:17:22.818 --> 02:17:39.608]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[02:17:39.868 --> 02:17:46.452]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[02:17:46.792 --> 02:17:47.913]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[02:17:48.174 --> 02:17:52.799]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[02:17:52.919 --> 02:17:57.565]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[02:17:58.573 --> 02:18:03.136]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[02:18:03.436 --> 02:18:07.599]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[02:18:07.639 --> 02:18:10.441]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[02:18:10.501 --> 02:18:17.946]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[02:18:18.346 --> 02:18:22.629]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[02:18:22.949 --> 02:18:28.253]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed its ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:30.495]  I'm scared of these people.
[02:18:31.195 --> 02:18:34.578]  I'm very scared of them.
[02:18:38.622 --> 02:18:40.624]  How do you think the crack drop gets into the country?
[02:18:40.664 --> 02:18:42.065]  We don't own any planes.
[02:18:42.525 --> 02:18:43.606]  We don't own no ships.
[02:18:43.867 --> 02:18:47.209]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:54.136]  I will tell you, Director Deutch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:18:56.458 --> 02:19:03.680]  Men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[02:19:03.721 --> 02:19:08.682]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[02:19:08.722 --> 02:19:15.784]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas.
[02:19:16.245 --> 02:19:23.067]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-controvers
[02:19:23.607 --> 02:19:28.832]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[02:19:29.593 --> 02:19:35.518]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[02:19:36.098 --> 02:19:41.103]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[02:19:41.323 --> 02:19:44.506]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[02:19:45.026 --> 02:19:47.669]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:52.651]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[02:19:52.691 --> 02:19:53.592]  Lewinsky.
[02:19:53.612 --> 02:19:55.453]  These allegations are false.
[02:19:56.794 --> 02:20:02.277]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[02:20:05.658 --> 02:20:08.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.743 --> 02:20:30.449]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are witnessing the second American Revolution right now.
[02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:38.998]  And with the 4th of July right around the corner, what a better time to recognize the history that we are living right now.
[02:20:39.118 --> 02:20:39.939]  And what a better time
[02:20:41.323 --> 02:20:49.030]  Then now, to announce the 2nd American Revolution 4th of July Super Sale at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:21:17.607 --> 02:21:25.472]  We're low on supplies of Survival Shield X2 and with the 40% off that could sell out quickly so

[02:21:56.309 --> 02:22:10.873]  If every listener of the Alex Jones Show would use Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste as their main toothpaste, we would be unstoppable.
[02:22:12.033 --> 02:22:12.573]  Unstoppable!
[02:22:14.417 --> 02:22:19.780]  So if you have not switched to Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste at Infowarstore.com, what are you waiting for?
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:28.484]  It's the same price right now at 50% off as it is to get a tube of toothpaste at the store.
[02:22:28.544 --> 02:22:29.885]  Probably cheaper right now.
[02:22:30.005 --> 02:22:30.966]  And you have free shipping!
[02:22:31.466 --> 02:22:32.026]  Stock up!

[02:22:34.267 --> 02:22:35.508]  Switch your toothpaste.
[02:22:35.988 --> 02:22:37.089]  Switch your toothpaste brand.
[02:22:38.345 --> 02:22:46.930]  If every listener of the Alex Jones Show used super blue fluoride-free toothpaste, that would devastate the mainstream news.
[02:22:46.970 --> 02:22:48.791]  That would devastate The Globalist.
[02:22:49.571 --> 02:22:52.173]  That would devastate George Soros.
[02:22:54.114 --> 02:22:55.235]  But don't take my word for it.
[02:22:55.255 --> 02:23:00.458]  Just go and look at the thousands of five-star reviews
[02:23:01.713 --> 02:23:06.736]  We will be hearing from Alex again before the end of the transmission here today to talk about a
[02:23:28.083 --> 02:23:37.831]  Let's just say news story, rumor mill type of thing with a certain individual perhaps becoming the next press secretary.
[02:23:37.911 --> 02:23:40.293]  Perhaps there'll be hope back in the White House.
[02:23:40.933 --> 02:23:43.936]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones on that later.
[02:23:44.276 --> 02:23:53.463]  In the meantime, I want to mention something again and then I want to laugh at Whoopi Goldberg, but I have a, this is a document, the crew gave this to me.
[02:23:53.924 --> 02:23:57.206]  It's from Robert Goodlatte, Committee on the Judiciary.
[02:23:58.126 --> 02:24:00.568]  And it just documents in this document how the committees
[02:24:13.607 --> 02:24:23.350]  On the judiciary and on oversight have been requesting documents and answers from Rod Rosenstein for months now.
[02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:25.531]  For months now.
[02:24:26.071 --> 02:24:35.574]  They have been requesting the documents to see the origination of the spies in the Trump campaign from the FBI, to see who signed the FISA warrant.
[02:24:35.814 --> 02:24:39.315]  I mean, these are documents that should be able to be produced within 24 hours.
[02:24:39.335 --> 02:24:39.475]  Easily.
[02:24:41.812 --> 02:24:44.114]  Why isn't the FBI producing these documents?
[02:24:46.055 --> 02:24:56.703]  Why does Rod Rosenstein stand under oath and testify that he's got a team, he's seeking the documents, he wants to get this done, but doesn't get it done for months?
[02:24:56.823 --> 02:24:59.265]  This is a 24-hour process, easily.
[02:25:00.706 --> 02:25:02.708]  What is Rod Rosenstein doing over there at the FBI?
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:10.124]  I have a feeling that these documents being requested are going to magically disappear.
[02:25:10.964 --> 02:25:17.009]  If they haven't already, NSA deletes scores of call records over technical irregularities.
[02:25:18.830 --> 02:25:21.412]  The day after Rod Rosenstein's testimony?
[02:25:22.593 --> 02:25:26.456]  The day after the committees on oversight are requesting all of this data?
[02:25:28.738 --> 02:25:32.761]  Now you have to understand the bigger picture here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:35.723 --> 02:25:45.630]  This was a coordinated effort by the White House, the DOJ, and the FBI and the CIA to rig an election for Hillary Clinton.
[02:25:46.750 --> 02:25:48.472]  But it's not just for Hillary Clinton.
[02:25:48.872 --> 02:25:51.714]  It was for themselves, because Hillary was part of the team.
[02:25:52.314 --> 02:25:56.317]  Get that wicked witch dog freak off the screen, please.
[02:25:57.298 --> 02:25:58.618]  I'm serious, I can't look at Hillary Clinton.
[02:25:58.879 --> 02:25:59.319]  Take her off.
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:01.080]  Okay?
[02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:01.721]  You wanna do that?
[02:26:01.961 --> 02:26:02.201]  Alright.
[02:26:04.608 --> 02:26:09.830]  So, why did they not prosecute Hillary Clinton for the blatant crimes?
[02:26:10.250 --> 02:26:14.132]  Jim Comey comes out and says, here are all the crimes Hillary committed, we're not going to prosecute.
[02:26:14.152 --> 02:26:14.432]  Why?
[02:26:15.012 --> 02:26:16.993]  Because they were all in it together.
[02:26:17.794 --> 02:26:22.656]  They had to get Hillary Clinton in the White House to cover up from all of Obama's crimes.
[02:26:23.416 --> 02:26:26.037]  To cover up for the secret server that they all knew about.
[02:26:26.437 --> 02:26:28.098]  To cover up for the illegal spying.
[02:26:29.328 --> 02:26:34.692]  It's all one big racketeering gig that they're all involved in.
[02:26:34.732 --> 02:26:49.181]  But let me tell you something else, and I can't really get into this, and I don't even want to say what this is about to be honest, but we know about Obama running fast and furious, okay?
[02:26:50.305 --> 02:26:53.166]  We know about Obama running fast and furious.
[02:26:53.306 --> 02:26:57.507]  We now are learning about Obama running the illegal spying on Trump.
[02:26:58.087 --> 02:27:09.310]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know how much of this is going to come out when this is all said and done, but what else was Obama running?
[02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:14.311]  What other false flags did Obama have his fingerprints on?
[02:27:16.732 --> 02:27:17.932]  I don't even know if I should say it.
[02:27:21.641 --> 02:27:32.403]  But let's just say using children as a political pawn for these people is just par for the course.
[02:27:35.483 --> 02:27:36.384]  Let's just leave it at that.
[02:27:37.904 --> 02:27:43.825]  What other operations was President Hussein Obama behind?
[02:27:47.145 --> 02:27:50.926]  And I just wonder how much of it is going to come out, folks, and I wonder how much of it
[02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:59.664]  Just got erased with the NSA deleting scores of call records over technical irregularities.
[02:28:00.663 --> 02:28:10.427]  You think that's a coincidence the day after Rod Rosenstein is getting grilled on the Hill that they're about to subpoena them and take them to court over the refusal to turn over these documents?
[02:28:10.727 --> 02:28:14.709]  You don't think Rod Rosenstein is deleting these documents every day?
[02:28:14.849 --> 02:28:16.930]  What do you think Rod Rosenstein is doing at the FBI?
[02:28:17.450 --> 02:28:18.791]  He doesn't know what's going on.
[02:28:18.831 --> 02:28:19.551]  You heard his testimony.
[02:28:19.571 --> 02:28:21.052]  He has no idea what's going on.
[02:28:21.072 --> 02:28:23.292]  He's trying to get the documents.
[02:28:23.332 --> 02:28:24.413]  So what is he doing?
[02:28:27.250 --> 02:28:33.954]  He is literally covering up for all the illegalities during the Obama administration, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:34.534 --> 02:28:35.094]  That's what he's doing.
[02:28:36.095 --> 02:28:36.835]  He's cleaning house.
[02:28:36.875 --> 02:28:38.036]  He's erasing the evidence.
[02:28:38.076 --> 02:28:39.417]  He is obstructing justice.
[02:28:40.157 --> 02:28:41.137]  And they're gonna get caught!
[02:28:42.558 --> 02:28:50.783]  Because unless Peter Stroke was not under oath when he gave his closed-door hearing, one of those two perjured themselves.
[02:28:51.443 --> 02:28:55.145]  So if Peter Stroke was under oath, in fact, I should look this up for sure, if Stroke was under oath,
[02:28:56.542 --> 02:29:00.184]  Based on a cross reference, one of them lied.

[02:31:06.663 --> 02:31:07.204]  Thanks for holding.
[02:31:07.264 --> 02:31:08.184]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:31:08.704 --> 02:31:12.245]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[02:31:12.305 --> 02:31:25.449]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was pretty cool, and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests,
[02:31:25.589 --> 02:31:29.230]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:36.231]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body.
[02:31:36.251 --> 02:31:37.211]  It's all amazing.
[02:31:37.231 --> 02:31:37.792]  Thank you, brother.
[02:31:37.852 --> 02:31:46.373]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:31:46.433 --> 02:31:51.194]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:31:51.334 --> 02:31:54.155]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[02:32:01.341 --> 02:32:08.608]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:32:08.968 --> 02:32:16.535]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:32:16.895 --> 02:32:19.978]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:32:20.618 --> 02:32:24.863]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:32:25.243 --> 02:32:29.148]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:32:29.388 --> 02:32:32.111]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:32:32.531 --> 02:32:36.836]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:32:37.296 --> 02:32:40.320]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:55.607]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:32:55.827 --> 02:32:57.107]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:32:57.348 --> 02:32:59.829]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:33:06.652 --> 02:33:09.273]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.175 --> 02:33:28.821]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.221 --> 02:33:32.564]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:44.754 --> 02:33:46.175]  You think the FBI's corrupt?
[02:33:47.577 --> 02:33:49.058]  President Trump has exposed them.
[02:33:53.348 --> 02:33:58.431]  You think big pharmaceutical companies are corrupt?
[02:34:00.232 --> 02:34:14.261]  Well, Trump's Department of Justice has just criminally charged 76 doctors, 23 pharmacists, and 19 nurses raking in billions in medical fraud to push toxic drugs.
[02:34:16.163 --> 02:34:22.607]  This is really so key that I don't even know if I can do it justice covering it here right now.
[02:34:23.678 --> 02:34:25.140]  This runs so deep.
[02:34:25.781 --> 02:34:27.284]  This runs so rampant.
[02:34:27.725 --> 02:34:31.050]  How do you think all of these children end up on drugs, folks?
[02:34:31.570 --> 02:34:32.632]  How do you think more than half
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:38.282]  Of college students in America end up on big pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:34:38.642 --> 02:34:43.284]  This is a racketeering, this is a medical racketeering operation.
[02:34:44.265 --> 02:34:51.828]  And doctors and big pharmaceutical companies are making deals to push these things down your throats and they're getting cuts for it.
[02:34:52.629 --> 02:34:59.652]  And it's all getting exposed now and Trump's DOJ just cracked down over two billion dollars in medical fraud.
[02:35:01.273 --> 02:35:01.853]  Pill pushers.
[02:35:04.329 --> 02:35:08.854]  And then those jacked up pills that they have these kids on jacked their heads up.
[02:35:12.517 --> 02:35:13.018]  Look at this!
[02:35:14.679 --> 02:35:16.081]  Big Pharma's war on children.
[02:35:16.261 --> 02:35:19.104]  One million kids under age six on psychiatric drugs.
[02:35:19.204 --> 02:35:20.445]  My God.
[02:35:23.828 --> 02:35:25.390]  I'm sorry, that's just like a gut blow to me.
[02:35:25.870 --> 02:35:26.171]  I just...
[02:35:28.143 --> 02:35:29.845]  These drugs just jack you up, folks.
[02:35:30.145 --> 02:35:34.329]  I mean, beyond just a physical thing, it's a spiritual thing, too.
[02:35:35.551 --> 02:35:35.871]  Wow.
[02:35:36.932 --> 02:35:37.212]  Wow.
[02:35:39.875 --> 02:35:41.537]  So, thank you, President Trump.
[02:35:42.417 --> 02:35:44.419]  I guess we have to thank Sessions for this, too.
[02:35:45.020 --> 02:35:45.681]  Thank you, Sessions.
[02:35:46.903 --> 02:35:47.783]  Thank you, Jeff Sessions.
[02:35:47.803 --> 02:35:49.364]  You gotta give credit where credit is deserved.
[02:35:49.404 --> 02:36:01.007]  Thank you, Jeff Sessions, for doing something about big pharmaceutical Western medicine industrial complex poisoning our children, poisoning our youth, poisoning our culture.
[02:36:01.127 --> 02:36:01.587]  Thank you.
[02:36:04.128 --> 02:36:04.848]  Thank you, God.
[02:36:05.768 --> 02:36:14.951]  May these kids be free from this wicked, satanic culture of drugging the children.
[02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:17.411]  Oh my gosh.
[02:36:20.712 --> 02:36:21.973]  Sorry, the crew just handed that to me.
[02:36:22.634 --> 02:36:24.215]  I just know how messed up this is.
[02:36:24.235 --> 02:36:29.217]  I've had friends that have been really messed up by these drugs, man.
[02:36:29.378 --> 02:36:31.299]  I mean, wow.
[02:36:33.220 --> 02:36:35.601]  I won't even take an Advil for a hangover anymore.
[02:36:40.473 --> 02:36:43.395]  So, anyway, thank you, President Trump.
[02:36:43.415 --> 02:36:44.476]  Thank you, Jeff Sessions.
[02:36:44.656 --> 02:36:52.321]  And just thank God that these children are not going to have these pills shoved down their throats anymore for the benefit of a bunch of corrupt doctors.
[02:36:53.341 --> 02:36:58.725]  Man, that is just... And if you don't think they'll do the same thing, oh, oh, oh!
[02:37:01.086 --> 02:37:01.767]  You know what's next?
[02:37:02.807 --> 02:37:04.368]  They're going after the vaccine makers.
[02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:07.050]  Yep.
[02:37:10.145 --> 02:37:12.386]  They're gonna go after the vaccine companies next, folks.
[02:37:14.388 --> 02:37:20.291]  Vaccine makers, do you realize how much they pay out per year for lawsuits?
[02:37:21.632 --> 02:37:23.293]  I mean, they attack us!
[02:37:23.974 --> 02:37:26.435]  They attack us for fake lawsuits!
[02:37:27.116 --> 02:37:31.058]  Frivolous lawsuits that don't even have real legal grounds!
[02:37:32.299 --> 02:37:34.600]  And they say, look, InfoWars is being sued!
[02:37:34.821 --> 02:37:35.661]  They're discredited!
[02:37:36.021 --> 02:37:36.802]  Fake lawsuits!
[02:37:38.007 --> 02:37:46.191]  Vaccine manufacturers have paid out probably billions of dollars now with all the lawsuits that they've had to deal with.
[02:37:46.431 --> 02:37:48.072]  Do you know that they have a secret court?
[02:37:50.393 --> 02:37:50.553]  Oh!
[02:37:53.155 --> 02:37:58.257]  But the same liberals that will point at InfoWars say, you're discredited, you've had a lawsuit, fake lawsuits, we beat them all.
[02:37:59.178 --> 02:38:05.861]  Big pharma and vaccine companies get sued all the time, pay out trillions of dollars maybe all the time, but definitely billions.
[02:38:07.712 --> 02:38:08.973]  Where's the finger pointing at them?
[02:38:09.694 --> 02:38:10.534]  Poisoning children.
[02:38:13.896 --> 02:38:14.957]  Oh, I can see it now.
[02:38:18.419 --> 02:38:19.160]  Oh my gosh.
[02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:22.302]  I mean... Oh my gosh.
[02:38:24.283 --> 02:38:26.365]  We're talking about real justice here, folks.
[02:38:27.886 --> 02:38:29.827]  We're talking about real justice here.
[02:38:31.608 --> 02:38:36.671]  The vaccines... I mean... Wow.
[02:38:37.682 --> 02:38:40.263]  I'm telling you, they're coming after the vaccine makers next.
[02:38:44.284 --> 02:38:45.445]  This is just the stepladder.
[02:38:46.885 --> 02:38:52.947]  And vaccines might be the final rung on that ladder, but we're gonna get ya.
[02:38:53.187 --> 02:38:55.568]  We know that you're now pushing Gardasil again.
[02:38:56.028 --> 02:38:59.109]  You know that they're now pushing Gardasil again?
[02:38:59.469 --> 02:39:00.069]  Here's what they do.
[02:39:00.409 --> 02:39:05.471]  They make all these poisonous vaccines, and they have to sell them.
[02:39:06.704 --> 02:39:16.912]  And it doesn't matter that even though it was proven not to be effective, but also proven to have more negative side effects than positive side effects, they're going to keep pushing the Gardasil shot!
[02:39:20.575 --> 02:39:24.318]  Ladies and gentlemen, avoid these vaccines at all costs, okay?
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:26.880]  That's my advice.
[02:39:29.202 --> 02:39:29.863]  And here's the funny thing.
[02:39:30.243 --> 02:39:32.165]  If you want the vaccine, you can have the vaccine.
[02:39:32.884 --> 02:39:33.804]  Your body, your choice.
[02:39:34.144 --> 02:39:35.705]  My body, my choice, I don't want the vaccine.
[02:39:35.865 --> 02:39:37.225]  Your body, your choice, you want the vaccine.
[02:39:38.865 --> 02:39:42.606]  But why would you be a threat for the disease if you're vaccinated for it?
[02:39:42.746 --> 02:39:44.607]  It's so fake, oh my gosh!
[02:39:44.867 --> 02:39:47.627]  I'm sorry, I didn't even plan on talking about this segment.
[02:39:48.228 --> 02:39:49.448]  But this is really key.
[02:39:50.228 --> 02:39:56.690]  I'm going to open up the phone lines now because we'll take your calls in the following segment and then Roger Stone in the fourth hour is going to take your calls too.
[02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:57.970]  So I'm going to open up the phone lines now.
[02:39:59.241 --> 02:40:00.342]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:40:00.362 --> 02:40:01.563]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:40:01.863 --> 02:40:04.546]  Go ahead and open up the phone lines.
[02:40:05.046 --> 02:40:06.628]  I'll take some calls in the next segment.
[02:40:06.668 --> 02:40:08.269]  Roger Stone will take your calls in the fourth hour.
[02:40:08.770 --> 02:40:16.677]  But let's actually go to this clip here to a deranged lunatic, Whoopi Goldberg, who thinks she speaks for all women.
[02:40:16.717 --> 02:40:18.198]  Trust me, she doesn't.
[02:40:18.438 --> 02:40:21.901]  And this clip here, let's just go to Whoopi Goldberg.
[02:40:21.921 --> 02:40:23.543]  Take mine.
[02:40:25.083 --> 02:40:27.524]  I feel like you're the one with the problem.
[02:40:27.784 --> 02:40:33.865]  If you take my right away from me to judge what I do for my family and my body, I got a little problem with that.
[02:40:33.906 --> 02:40:34.966]  You got a problem?
[02:40:35.286 --> 02:40:37.166]  You don't want people to take your guns?
[02:40:37.366 --> 02:40:38.587]  Get out of my behind!
[02:40:38.607 --> 02:40:39.547]  Get out of my vagina!
[02:40:39.567 --> 02:40:39.927]  Get out!
[02:40:44.048 --> 02:40:44.348]  What?
[02:40:46.269 --> 02:40:47.789]  Get out of my behind?
[02:40:48.050 --> 02:40:49.370]  Get out of my vagina?
[02:40:51.656 --> 02:40:55.739]  Uh, that joke writes itself, so I'm not gonna go there.
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:58.941]  But, who is Whoopi Goldberg?
[02:40:59.181 --> 02:41:00.803]  What, you think you speak for all women?
[02:41:01.003 --> 02:41:01.503]  You don't.
[02:41:01.823 --> 02:41:04.465]  In fact, most women think you're a total nutjob.
[02:41:04.985 --> 02:41:05.686]  You want to be real.
[02:41:06.827 --> 02:41:10.689]  But here's an amazing thing about the psychology of these people's politics.
[02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:18.435]  Why does the gun issue have anything to do with whatever it is you're talking about being in your behind?
[02:41:20.943 --> 02:41:23.345]  Is somebody stopping you from putting things in your behind, Whoopi?
[02:41:23.565 --> 02:41:24.505]  I'm not really understanding this.
[02:41:25.486 --> 02:41:26.666]  Of course, we get what she's saying.
[02:41:26.706 --> 02:41:30.288]  She's saying, I should be allowed to kill my kid if you should be allowed to have a gun.
[02:41:30.628 --> 02:41:32.209]  That's really what she's saying here.
[02:41:32.229 --> 02:41:32.749]  But think about it.
[02:41:34.170 --> 02:41:39.232]  Think about the absurdity of that type of politics.
[02:41:39.553 --> 02:41:41.353]  That is spite politics.
[02:41:42.794 --> 02:41:44.055]  That's not real politics.
[02:41:45.075 --> 02:41:48.317]  That's not logic and reasoning based politics.
[02:41:50.330 --> 02:41:52.392]  That's literally spite politics.
[02:41:53.333 --> 02:42:02.341]  Where you take one issue and you don't like the results on one issue, so then you take another issue and you take a stance on that because you didn't like somebody's stance on that.
[02:42:02.922 --> 02:42:04.583]  Do you realize the absurdity of that?
[02:42:06.305 --> 02:42:07.146]  That is crazy!
[02:42:08.107 --> 02:42:09.068]  But you know what, Whoopi?
[02:42:09.708 --> 02:42:10.109]  We get it.
[02:42:11.158 --> 02:42:13.460]  You want to kill black babies in the womb.
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:14.301]  We know it, Whoopi.
[02:42:14.601 --> 02:42:15.662]  You hate black children.
[02:42:16.323 --> 02:42:21.467]  You're glad that the black population in New York City is being destroyed by abortion.
[02:42:21.767 --> 02:42:25.551]  You're glad that Planned Parenthood murders millions of black babies every year.
[02:42:25.691 --> 02:42:26.292]  We get it, Whoopi.
[02:42:27.112 --> 02:42:27.472]  We get it.
[02:42:27.532 --> 02:42:28.513]  You love genocide.
[02:42:28.813 --> 02:42:29.253]  We know it.
[02:42:29.313 --> 02:42:32.055]  The left loves genocide.
[02:42:32.495 --> 02:42:33.376]  But here's the thing, Whoopi.
[02:42:33.676 --> 02:42:33.996]  I get it.
[02:42:34.056 --> 02:42:34.456]  You know what?
[02:42:34.557 --> 02:42:34.917]  We get it.
[02:42:35.377 --> 02:42:35.737]  Trust me.
[02:42:35.897 --> 02:42:37.178]  Nobody wants to be in your behind.
[02:42:37.358 --> 02:42:40.460]  Nobody wants to be anywhere near anything that you have to deal with, okay?
[02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:41.561]  Let alone the stench.
[02:42:43.442 --> 02:42:44.042]  I don't care.
[02:42:44.142 --> 02:42:48.465]  If you want to kill your babies, if you want to have black genocide in America, fine, Whoopi.
[02:42:48.505 --> 02:42:49.045]  You can go do that.
[02:42:49.305 --> 02:42:49.966]  Here's something for you.
[02:42:50.366 --> 02:42:51.587]  I don't want to pay for it!
[02:42:52.839 --> 02:42:56.440]  I don't want my tax dollars going towards black genocide!
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:58.481]  Whoopi, you can fund that if you want!
[02:43:02.422 --> 02:43:06.003]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[02:43:06.263 --> 02:43:12.945]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google, they have filed 13 lawsuits, we've beaten six.
[02:43:13.245 --> 02:43:17.386]  But understand this, I am your soldier, you're my soldier, we're all in this together.
[02:43:18.446 --> 02:43:23.149]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[02:43:23.549 --> 02:43:24.550]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[02:43:24.570 --> 02:43:35.757]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, InfoWars.com, or slash show, local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.
[02:43:35.797 --> 02:43:37.959]  And when you financially go to InfoWarsStore.com,
[02:43:38.539 --> 02:43:44.282]  When you take advantage of the huge sales and the great products for everything in your life, it's about making your life better.
[02:43:44.923 --> 02:43:47.084]  The non-GMO heirloom seeds, springtime's here.
[02:43:47.644 --> 02:43:51.586]  The highest quality books, films, Patriot apparel to spread the word.
[02:43:51.906 --> 02:43:57.430]  The very best supplements, water filtration, air filtration, shortwave radios, emergency radios, tactical gear, body armor.
[02:43:57.810 --> 02:44:00.011]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:00.371 --> 02:44:01.572]  Please shop with the good guys.
[02:44:04.189 --> 02:44:08.132]  They were deemed unsafe to the community on Facebook.
[02:44:08.432 --> 02:44:09.833]  Just ridiculous.
[02:44:10.113 --> 02:44:11.674]  I mean, they're unsafe to the community.
[02:44:11.874 --> 02:44:14.816]  Kathie Lee Griffin can depict herself decapitating Trump.
[02:44:14.897 --> 02:44:15.397]  That's cool.
[02:44:15.717 --> 02:44:18.039]  Snoop Dogg can depict himself shooting Trump in the head.
[02:44:18.299 --> 02:44:19.079]  No problem there.
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:25.344]  But Diamond and Silk just having an opinion and existing is unsafe to the Facebook community.
[02:44:25.644 --> 02:44:27.926]  And then Zuckerberg today says it was an enforcement error.
[02:44:28.006 --> 02:44:33.770]  Do you believe Mark Zuckerberg when he says the censorship against you was an enforcement error?
[02:44:34.250 --> 02:44:35.051]  No, I do not.
[02:44:35.151 --> 02:44:36.373]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:44:36.393 --> 02:44:44.182]  Keep in mind, we've been back and forth with Facebook for 6 months, 29 days, 5 hours, 40 minutes, and 43 seconds.
[02:44:44.302 --> 02:44:44.622]  Right.
[02:44:44.742 --> 02:44:45.463]  Back and forth.
[02:44:45.523 --> 02:44:52.571]  We have emails, we have chats, where we've been back and forth about these different issues that's been going on on our page.
[02:44:52.591 --> 02:44:53.092]  That's right.
[02:44:53.152 --> 02:44:53.933]  We've gotten just
[02:44:54.193 --> 02:44:57.055]  Pushed to the side, told this, told that.
[02:44:57.155 --> 02:44:59.156]  Well, we got to deal with the tech support team.
[02:44:59.496 --> 02:45:00.277]  We don't know.
[02:45:00.497 --> 02:45:02.978]  Well, there's been no restrictions on your page.
[02:45:03.298 --> 02:45:05.660]  We don't see anything wrong with your page.
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:06.760]  Check your settings.
[02:45:07.021 --> 02:45:11.463]  It's been like that back and forth for almost seven months.
[02:45:11.543 --> 02:45:11.883]  Right.
[02:45:12.464 --> 02:45:14.245]  See, this is the thing that we're talking about.
[02:45:14.995 --> 02:45:16.836]  Discrimination is wrong.
[02:45:16.856 --> 02:45:18.697]  I don't care where it's coming from.
[02:45:18.717 --> 02:45:19.157]  That's right.
[02:45:19.257 --> 02:45:22.079]  And what I find appalling is this is how the left do things.
[02:45:22.599 --> 02:45:24.020]  They take in everything.
[02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:26.501]  If you are conservative, you're racist.
[02:45:26.861 --> 02:45:28.382]  If you are that, you're discriminating.
[02:45:28.402 --> 02:45:30.063]  If you're a Republican, you're discriminating.
[02:45:30.383 --> 02:45:31.303]  This is what they do.
[02:45:31.663 --> 02:45:33.524]  But now, let's fit this here.
[02:45:33.564 --> 02:45:33.884]  That's right.
[02:45:33.904 --> 02:45:38.747]  Now you have two black conservative women who are Republicans who support the president.
[02:45:38.827 --> 02:45:39.207]  That's right.
[02:45:39.227 --> 02:45:42.769]  But you have a white liberal who owns this platform
[02:45:43.409 --> 02:45:46.591]  Discriminating against two people of color.
[02:45:46.771 --> 02:45:49.052]  And I want them to see the hypocrisy that's here.
[02:45:49.412 --> 02:45:52.394]  About, don't point the finger at conservatives and Republicans.
[02:45:52.694 --> 02:45:54.074]  Let's look at what's happening here.
[02:45:54.114 --> 02:45:54.495]  That's right.
[02:45:54.515 --> 02:45:56.135]  Because I'm sorry, I don't care what nobody say.
[02:45:56.456 --> 02:46:02.999]  We were discriminated against when you deemed our brand, which is two women, when you deemed us unsafe to the community.
[02:46:03.219 --> 02:46:09.422]  You tarnished and you branded us and you painted us into something because you thought we was going to go somewhere and sit down.
[02:46:09.943 --> 02:46:13.251]  And Mark Zuckerberg, he's obtained the American Dream.
[02:46:13.832 --> 02:46:16.518]  Diamond and Silk, we are obtaining the American Dream.
[02:46:16.799 --> 02:46:19.645]  But for someone to come and pull the rug from underneath you...
[02:46:20.513 --> 02:46:29.055]  Tell you to bring yourself up, make this here happen, and then when you start making it happen, they try to kick you back down and put their foot on your neck.
[02:46:29.655 --> 02:46:31.036]  That's basically what happened.
[02:46:31.096 --> 02:46:36.237]  Listen you all, if you are being censored and if you know you right, then you're going to have to fight.
[02:46:36.717 --> 02:46:41.758]  And when we stand here, and when we're here, and we're even fighting for our cause, we're fighting for you too.
[02:46:42.159 --> 02:46:43.439]  If you are a conservative, if you...
[02:46:44.779 --> 02:46:49.321]  The algorithms do need to be removed from your pages and that's what we're also fighting for.
[02:46:49.541 --> 02:46:50.742]  So we're in this together.
[02:46:50.822 --> 02:46:55.023]  And don't forget to go to diamondandsilk.com and visit our chit chat tour link.
[02:46:55.603 --> 02:46:57.464]  Go and see where we're going to be at.
[02:46:57.664 --> 02:46:58.305]  Check us out.
[02:46:58.485 --> 02:46:59.965]  We want to see your face in a place.
[02:47:00.025 --> 02:47:00.805]  We love you guys.
[02:47:06.067 --> 02:47:08.729]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.170 --> 02:47:19.392]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:19.833 --> 02:47:25.198]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:47:25.438 --> 02:47:28.481]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:47:28.902 --> 02:47:35.068]  You know, there's a few celebrities, a few athletes out there that are willing to stick their neck out for President Trump.
[02:47:37.410 --> 02:47:38.091]  They're gonna be more.
[02:47:39.747 --> 02:47:49.832]  And when that day comes and there's an overwhelming amount of athletes and celebrities that come out to support President Trump, it's game over for the anti-American globalists.
[02:47:49.892 --> 02:47:51.733]  It's game over.
[02:47:51.794 --> 02:47:53.935]  Because that will awake the sleeping giant.
[02:47:54.395 --> 02:47:55.455]  And then it'll be game over.
[02:47:56.356 --> 02:48:01.559]  You know, I saw the diamond and silk piece that's running on our local feed here.
[02:48:02.625 --> 02:48:09.675]  There's so much news, I don't even know if anybody covered this here, where Diamond and Silk were at Maxine Waters' office and Maxine Waters kicked them out.
[02:48:13.140 --> 02:48:15.523]  Diamond and Silk are just awesome, man.
[02:48:15.563 --> 02:48:16.605]  Those women, I love them.
[02:48:16.845 --> 02:48:17.206]  I love them.
[02:48:18.604 --> 02:48:20.205]  And, yeah, there's the video right there.
[02:48:21.645 --> 02:48:22.965]  Maxine Waters kicks them out.
[02:48:23.326 --> 02:48:25.006]  You know, because she's so tolerant and loving.
[02:48:25.266 --> 02:48:27.727]  Like with Laura Loomer, she's like, come to my office!
[02:48:27.967 --> 02:48:28.747]  Come to my office!
[02:48:28.987 --> 02:48:29.788]  Come to my office!
[02:48:29.888 --> 02:48:32.589]  And then Loomer follows him onto the elevator like, okay, I'll go to your office.
[02:48:32.609 --> 02:48:34.229]  And then she's like, get off the elevator!
[02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:35.369]  Get off the elevator!
[02:48:35.569 --> 02:48:36.450]  Get off the elevator!
[02:48:37.950 --> 02:48:42.432]  Maxine Waters, what a... Anyway, let's go out to the phone lines here.
[02:48:43.512 --> 02:48:45.873]  Let's start with Wilde in Wisconsin.
[02:48:45.893 --> 02:48:46.373]  Go ahead, Wilde.
[02:48:50.937 --> 02:49:04.655]  I wanted to make a little observation and wondering if you agreed with the new socialist in New York, if she kind of has that Alison Mack look to her eyes.
[02:49:08.134 --> 02:49:19.344]  Well, I will tell you this, my theory on that, and I have a conspiracy theory here, I'll tell you when I have a conspiracy theory, I don't know about what you're talking about, I actually, honestly, actually, I disagree with you, actually.
[02:49:19.724 --> 02:49:22.427]  What I see is a true believer.
[02:49:23.087 --> 02:49:23.788]  That's what I see.
[02:49:24.268 --> 02:49:27.111]  I really believe, and she's my age, so I understand
[02:49:28.697 --> 02:49:29.537]  Where she's coming from.
[02:49:30.318 --> 02:49:33.259]  Look, I was a brainwashed liberal for a little bit of my life, too.
[02:49:33.319 --> 02:49:35.340]  Now, I wasn't radical off the hinge.
[02:49:35.800 --> 02:49:42.163]  I just kind of bought into the whole, you know, hate the white man, you know, America's bad, this stuff.
[02:49:42.403 --> 02:49:46.865]  It was my time at the major university, honestly, University of Missouri, when that happened, for two years.
[02:49:47.725 --> 02:49:50.346]  As soon as I left there, it was like, okay, I woke up to all of it.
[02:49:50.366 --> 02:49:52.187]  So it was like, I wasn't like that in high school.
[02:49:52.707 --> 02:49:53.848]  I went to Mizzou, Columbia.
[02:49:54.528 --> 02:49:58.890]  Became like that for two years, and then was able to break out of it a couple years after that.
[02:49:58.930 --> 02:50:00.611]  So I know what it is.
[02:50:00.791 --> 02:50:01.872]  I know the propaganda.
[02:50:02.032 --> 02:50:03.713]  I can recognize this stuff.
[02:50:05.474 --> 02:50:06.954]  And so I'm the same age as her.
[02:50:08.055 --> 02:50:10.176]  What I see in her eyes is a true believer.
[02:50:10.276 --> 02:50:18.800]  This is a girl who's really bought the propaganda, who really thinks that the white man is to blame, and who really believes in socialism.
[02:50:19.841 --> 02:50:23.843]  I mean, she is a true believer in socialism.
[02:50:24.730 --> 02:50:38.524]  And so what the Democrats are going to do... What the Democrats are going to do is they're going to use this time to change their message and go full socialist.
[02:50:39.245 --> 02:50:39.926]  That's what they're going to do.
[02:50:40.226 --> 02:50:45.151]  You heard Hillary Clinton say, I think being a capitalist hurt me in November.
[02:50:45.451 --> 02:50:45.651]  What?
[02:50:46.966 --> 02:50:49.226]  So they're going to go full socialist now.
[02:50:49.386 --> 02:50:50.547]  They have no other message.
[02:50:50.687 --> 02:50:52.127]  The hate Trump message isn't working.
[02:50:52.167 --> 02:50:55.428]  The racism message, all their fake news narratives aren't working.
[02:50:55.548 --> 02:50:56.828]  I mean, none of them are working!
[02:50:57.268 --> 02:50:59.028]  Do I need to go list them all off again?
[02:50:59.488 --> 02:51:02.269]  So they're going to move forward full socialist now.
[02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:03.629]  Now here's my conspiracy theory.
[02:51:04.729 --> 02:51:07.310]  I don't trust electronic voter machines as far as I can throw them.
[02:51:07.530 --> 02:51:08.190]  They're pretty heavy.
[02:51:08.350 --> 02:51:09.230]  Can't throw them too far.
[02:51:10.411 --> 02:51:12.491]  I wouldn't be shocked if this thing was totally rigged.
[02:51:13.993 --> 02:51:17.476]  So that you can get her in, make her the face of the Democrat Socialist Party.
[02:51:17.496 --> 02:51:18.556]  The Democrat Party's dead.
[02:51:18.977 --> 02:51:20.498]  Now you have the Democrat Socialist Party.
[02:51:20.738 --> 02:51:22.760]  You have a nice face to come with it.
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:26.923]  You have a true believer who really believes this stuff.
[02:51:27.503 --> 02:51:29.625]  So she doesn't even realize the bigger agenda.
[02:51:29.645 --> 02:51:31.646]  She doesn't even realize she's a little pawn in the game.
[02:51:32.087 --> 02:51:33.448]  How else do you explain this guy?
[02:51:34.048 --> 02:51:47.880]  Winning landslide elections every time he runs for like 20 years, and then this girl comes out of nowhere, she was even shocked at her own victory, and then magically, perfect timing, the Democrats are ready to go with the socialist message.
[02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:48.801]  So that's what I believe.
[02:51:49.602 --> 02:51:53.806]  As far as the caller saying anything with Allison Mack, look, no, I don't see that.
[02:51:53.926 --> 02:51:54.987]  I think this is a true believer.
[02:51:55.187 --> 02:51:56.128]  She's a bartender!
[02:51:58.072 --> 02:51:59.112]  She's literally a bartender.
[02:51:59.492 --> 02:52:00.212]  Now she's not anymore.
[02:52:00.252 --> 02:52:01.713]  Now she's going to be the face of the Democrat Party.
[02:52:02.113 --> 02:52:03.333]  That's my conspiracy theory.
[02:52:03.373 --> 02:52:04.553]  That's where I think they're going with this.
[02:52:04.873 --> 02:52:05.873]  Let's move on to another call.
[02:52:05.913 --> 02:52:07.674]  Let's go to Grant calling in from Iowa.
[02:52:07.694 --> 02:52:08.274]  Go ahead, Grant.
[02:52:10.114 --> 02:52:10.714]  Hey, Ellen.
[02:52:10.994 --> 02:52:16.255]  I just had a couple of comments to start on the vaccine issue that you were talking about a little bit ago.
[02:52:17.335 --> 02:52:17.736]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:52:20.196 --> 02:52:25.477]  I think we kind of over-diagnosed things like ADHD and depression, obviously.
[02:52:26.889 --> 02:52:29.651]  And I think that definitely feeds into the victimhood mentality.
[02:52:29.671 --> 02:52:35.654]  You know, I've had people tell me that, you know, they don't want to learn trig or calculus or higher level math.
[02:52:35.674 --> 02:52:38.075]  They're worried that they can't do it because they have ADHD.
[02:52:38.255 --> 02:52:39.176]  Well, see, it's like this.
[02:52:39.276 --> 02:52:39.876]  It's like this to me.
[02:52:39.916 --> 02:52:43.678]  They say, oh, you know, oh, I've got anxiety.
[02:52:44.058 --> 02:52:45.159]  You know, I've got anxiety.
[02:52:45.179 --> 02:52:45.339]  I need a...
[02:52:46.633 --> 02:52:48.194]  Who doesn't have anxiety?
[02:52:48.855 --> 02:52:51.296]  Like, this is a normal thing to endure.
[02:52:51.476 --> 02:52:52.077]  Anxiety.
[02:52:52.097 --> 02:52:53.758]  It's like, oh, you know, I have anxiety.
[02:52:53.858 --> 02:52:54.719]  Oh, here's a pill.
[02:52:55.519 --> 02:52:56.119]  Oh, really?
[02:52:56.140 --> 02:52:57.060]  Wow.
[02:52:57.240 --> 02:53:02.764]  A 10-year-old has a hard time paying attention to a boring, you know, school environment for seven hours?
[02:53:03.124 --> 02:53:03.505]  Wow.
[02:53:03.725 --> 02:53:04.265]  Shocking.
[02:53:04.565 --> 02:53:07.587]  So they just say, oh, your kid just has ADHD.
[02:53:07.627 --> 02:53:08.488]  We have to give him a pill.
[02:53:08.848 --> 02:53:09.929]  Oh, you have anxiety.
[02:53:09.949 --> 02:53:10.749]  You must be depressed.
[02:53:10.769 --> 02:53:11.550]  We have to give you a pill.
[02:53:11.610 --> 02:53:15.573]  It's like, no, this is just regular stuff, but their solution is a pill.
[02:53:16.647 --> 02:53:17.027]  Exactly.
[02:53:17.067 --> 02:53:22.670]  So they kind of create the problem, they blow it out of proportion, and then they offer you a pharmaceutical remedy.
[02:53:23.770 --> 02:53:24.511]  That's the racket.
[02:53:25.211 --> 02:53:29.493]  This country was built on the principles of, you know, you gotta pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
[02:53:30.057 --> 02:53:30.417]  Bingo.
[02:53:30.537 --> 02:53:39.221]  And, you know, looking at social media and wishing that you could have fancy cars and clothes and be Kim Kardashian... Oh, but I just want to be a victim, you know?
[02:53:39.661 --> 02:53:42.823]  I'm just a victim because I'm not Kim Kardashian.
[02:53:42.843 --> 02:53:44.083]  I mean, it's just not fair.
[02:53:44.103 --> 02:53:50.086]  It's like, you know, look, I've said things about Kim Kardashian, you know, maybe she's coming out.
[02:53:50.186 --> 02:53:51.907]  It's not her fault people are stupid.
[02:53:52.567 --> 02:53:56.589]  She's smart enough to know, hey, all I got to do is put out anything and then people will buy it.
[02:53:58.351 --> 02:54:03.535]  Right, and you know, we can't be anti-capitalist because that's part of America too, so you know, you can't fault her for that.
[02:54:04.756 --> 02:54:09.240]  My other comment was on the immigration thing, and I'm surprised nobody's kind of brought this up.
[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:20.729]  You know, the child that was on the cover of Time Magazine, her mother, you know, took her away from her father without his permission, paid $6,000 to an illegal human trafficker,
[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:24.401]  I don't have $6,000 to send a child across the border illegally.
[02:54:41.866 --> 02:54:42.266]  Right.
[02:54:42.407 --> 02:54:43.387]  It's a fair amount of change.
[02:54:43.427 --> 02:54:45.609]  Most people don't have $6,000 in their bank account.
[02:54:46.129 --> 02:55:02.663]  So why is this woman told that the best way to use that money that she worked hard to save up is to pay it to an illegal trafficker instead of, like, taking a bus or train and getting here cheaply and then use that money to get the ball rolling on the long and expensive citizenship process?
[02:55:02.703 --> 02:55:05.545]  You know, I've had people that work for me that are from Sri Lanka.
[02:55:06.403 --> 02:55:14.291]  And, you know, to bring himself, his wife and his daughter here, cost him about $10,000 or $12,000, and it took, I think, almost five years.
[02:55:14.792 --> 02:55:21.999]  So wait, so your friend from Sri Lanka is dealing with what's going on over there and wants to come to America the legal way and goes through the process?
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:25.062]  Right, well he's already here, but I'm saying that's what he had to go through.
[02:55:25.102 --> 02:55:29.587]  And it took five years, you know, jump through all the hoops, paying all this money, but he did it the right way.
[02:55:30.208 --> 02:55:39.754]  So why is someone taking $6,000 and giving it to an illegal human trafficker who doesn't care about them at all, instead of, I don't know,
[02:55:40.427 --> 02:55:45.432]  Get a bus ticket for $50 and use the other $50 to get citizenship started!
[02:55:45.492 --> 02:55:53.520]  You make a great point, and it's honestly irrelevant to even answer the question, because the point is that they lied about the whole situation, okay?
[02:55:54.081 --> 02:55:59.907]  This child was separated by her own parents, and it was border control that saved her from that.
[02:56:00.558 --> 02:56:07.443]  But the overall issue is, why are the Democrats lying about this, and why do they want people to cheat?
[02:56:07.564 --> 02:56:08.084]  That's what they want.
[02:56:08.104 --> 02:56:09.745]  They're encouraging skipping the line.
[02:56:10.606 --> 02:56:13.789]  Here's thousands of people going through the process to become a citizen here legally.
[02:56:14.169 --> 02:56:15.830]  The Democrats say, no, you can just button line.
[02:56:16.090 --> 02:56:17.571]  Just go ahead and button line.
[02:56:17.732 --> 02:56:18.853]  Why do the Democrats do that?
[02:56:19.613 --> 02:56:20.774]  Because they need a voter block.
[02:56:21.354 --> 02:56:23.396]  Because they need a voter block.
[02:56:23.796 --> 02:56:24.077]  All right.
[02:56:24.417 --> 02:56:25.318]  Thank you for the call, Grant.

[02:58:21.420 --> 02:58:22.580]  Yes, I can feel it!

[02:58:43.981 --> 02:58:44.221]  Come on!
[02:58:44.241 --> 02:58:44.421]  Come on!
[02:58:44.441 --> 02:58:44.641]  Come on!
[02:58:44.661 --> 02:58:44.881]  Come on!
[02:58:44.901 --> 02:58:45.142]  Come on!
[02:58:45.202 --> 02:58:45.502]  Come on!
[02:58:45.522 --> 02:58:45.662]  Come on!
[02:58:45.682 --> 02:58:45.902]  Come on!
[02:58:45.922 --> 02:58:46.182]  Come on!
[02:58:46.222 --> 02:58:46.382]  Come on!
[02:58:46.402 --> 02:58:46.642]  Come on!
[02:58:46.682 --> 02:58:46.943]  Come on!
[02:58:46.963 --> 02:58:47.183]  Come on!
[02:58:47.203 --> 02:58:47.463]  Come on!
[02:58:47.543 --> 02:58:47.703]  Come on!
[02:58:47.723 --> 02:58:47.943]  Come on!
[02:58:47.983 --> 02:58:48.263]  Come on!
[02:58:48.283 --> 02:58:48.484]  Come on!
[02:58:48.504 --> 02:58:48.644]  Come on!
[02:58:48.664 --> 02:58:48.824]  Come on!
[02:58:48.864 --> 02:58:49.004]  Come on
[02:58:55.680 --> 02:58:58.526]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[02:58:58.546 --> 02:59:03.736]  But these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever, ever meet.
[02:59:04.597 --> 02:59:06.461]  But we're gonna punch through the media.
[02:59:06.561 --> 02:59:07.142]  We have to.
[02:59:09.454 --> 02:59:14.198]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[02:59:14.999 --> 02:59:19.703]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[02:59:20.584 --> 02:59:22.826]  We will not fail.
[02:59:23.046 --> 02:59:25.489]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[02:59:26.149 --> 02:59:27.550]  That whether we are black
[02:59:29.693 --> 02:59:41.608]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[02:59:41.648 --> 02:59:43.591]  Victory for the world.
[02:59:54.116 --> 02:59:58.219]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:58.739 --> 03:00:00.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.706 --> 03:00:11.647]  You've found it.
[03:00:11.927 --> 03:00:13.488]  The tip of the spear.
[03:00:13.969 --> 03:00:18.571]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[03:00:19.332 --> 03:00:22.194]  You know, our last caller made a great point and it made me
[03:00:23.717 --> 03:00:26.238]  Think of something that I already knew, but it's worth saying again.
[03:00:28.019 --> 03:00:36.303]  Isn't it amazing how the Left and the Democrat Party can, I mean, literally flip reality on its head?
[03:00:38.164 --> 03:00:40.705]  They are calling for violence.
[03:00:41.826 --> 03:00:45.347]  I mean, again, I say literally all the time, but they're literally calling for violence!
[03:00:46.448 --> 03:00:48.969]  You've got dozens of compilations.
[03:00:49.189 --> 03:00:52.651]  The Left calling for violence all day long they're calling for violence.
[03:00:53.629 --> 03:00:54.390]  And then what do they do?
[03:00:54.810 --> 03:00:57.472]  They point the finger at you and say you're uncivil!
[03:00:58.333 --> 03:00:58.593]  What?
[03:01:01.536 --> 03:01:03.137]  How do they get away with this garbage?
[03:01:03.657 --> 03:01:09.943]  And then the caller on the... he talks about how these people are butting in line, they're skipping the legal process again.
[03:01:10.423 --> 03:01:13.486]  So they say Donald Trump is anti-immigration.
[03:01:14.046 --> 03:01:15.948]  They say Trump supporters are anti-immigration.
[03:01:16.888 --> 03:01:19.270]  They're the ones that are anti-immigration!
[03:01:20.242 --> 03:01:21.763]  We're pro-immigration!
[03:01:21.923 --> 03:01:23.484]  Trump is pro-immigration!
[03:01:23.845 --> 03:01:25.406]  They are anti-immigration!
[03:01:25.426 --> 03:01:30.629]  I mean, how does the left get away with this?
[03:01:30.789 --> 03:01:36.934]  They flip reality on its head and present to you the opposite of reality, and they expect you to buy it!
[03:01:37.414 --> 03:01:38.435]  And then the sheep will do!
[03:01:38.455 --> 03:01:45.660]  I just... Honestly, I'm just... I'm broadcasting live in the 1984 Orwellian world.
[03:01:49.761 --> 03:01:50.161]  Wow!
[03:01:50.982 --> 03:01:55.004]  Live from the Twilight Zone, Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[03:01:55.445 --> 03:01:58.226]  We go back out to the phone lines to Alex in Michigan.
[03:01:58.266 --> 03:01:58.967]  Go ahead, Alex.
[03:02:02.129 --> 03:02:03.450]  Hey, what's going on, Owen?
[03:02:03.510 --> 03:02:05.331]  Definitely feels like a Rod Sterling moment.
[03:02:05.651 --> 03:02:07.732]  I just had a quick comment and a question, if that's alright.
[03:02:07.953 --> 03:02:08.333]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:02:09.894 --> 03:02:13.256]  It was an interesting call, the last caller, about Big Pharma and the vaccine.
[03:02:14.245 --> 03:02:15.646]  And anxiety, it's proven.
[03:02:15.986 --> 03:02:19.388]  It's basically just cortisol stress hormones that cause anxiety.
[03:02:19.468 --> 03:02:23.810]  And if you're not using the Survival Shield X2, you're crazy to balance your hormones and detox.
[03:02:23.890 --> 03:02:25.971]  And if you're not filtering your water, you're crazy.
[03:02:26.471 --> 03:02:28.192]  Go to the InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:02:29.033 --> 03:02:30.053]  And also buy Roger's book.
[03:02:31.874 --> 03:02:32.614]  Anything else, Alex?
[03:02:33.555 --> 03:02:43.520]  Okay, my question was, I agree with Alex Jones in that, like, a lot of the minions of the liberals are well-meaning people, but at the very top levels,
[03:02:45.429 --> 03:02:50.213]  It seems like it is kind of this... I'd also like you to get David Icke back on the show.
[03:02:50.233 --> 03:03:05.525]  It seems like a satanic space alien kind of conspiracy where it's like this outside interdimensional evil force possessing these like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt and all these people that poison and kill us.
[03:03:06.206 --> 03:03:15.988]  Well, okay, so the vaccines is one angle of that, and then you look at the cell phone towers, and I know I'm kind of going off on a tangent here, but I mean, I can't even believe this stuff.
[03:03:16.128 --> 03:03:23.389]  If you're within a quarter mile of a cell phone tower, you're living in what is considered a danger zone for the radio waves.
[03:03:23.409 --> 03:03:32.771]  I mean, you can look at all the documents, all the studies, they consider that a biological hazard to be in that range of frequency for the cell phone towers.
[03:03:32.791 --> 03:03:34.871]  If you're within a quarter mile, you're living in a biohazard.
[03:03:35.717 --> 03:03:36.998]  And they're building more of them.
[03:03:37.659 --> 03:03:39.921]  You can't even drive a mile without finding one of these things.
[03:03:40.141 --> 03:03:41.102]  And they're building more?
[03:03:41.122 --> 03:03:42.944]  And they're going to bring out the 5G?
[03:03:43.205 --> 03:03:44.586]  Which is even going to be worse?
[03:03:45.507 --> 03:03:49.851]  And someone's like, oh yeah, look at this guy calling into the Alex Jones Show.
[03:03:49.871 --> 03:03:51.813]  Talking about space aliens taking over.
[03:03:52.854 --> 03:03:54.176]  Are we suicidal?
[03:03:55.509 --> 03:04:05.554]  Because, if we put these 5G towers everywhere, and keep blasting ourselves with this radiation, I mean, according to the science we have now, we're all gonna die!
[03:04:05.574 --> 03:04:08.155]  So, I mean, I don't know what's doing it.
[03:04:08.255 --> 03:04:09.636]  Are humans just suicidal?
[03:04:09.736 --> 03:04:13.198]  Or is it... I'm not saying it's an alien space... whatever.
[03:04:13.238 --> 03:04:14.258]  I'm just like, what is it?
[03:04:14.318 --> 03:04:17.760]  I don't know what's going... Why would we just do this if we know it's gonna kill us?
[03:04:18.761 --> 03:04:21.982]  Why do we put mercury in vaccines when we know it causes brain damage?
[03:04:24.303 --> 03:04:25.004]  Anything else, Alex?
[03:04:25.805 --> 03:04:27.007]  It's crazy, Owen.
[03:04:27.568 --> 03:04:36.544]  Like, we all dropped the ball, myself included, not protesting the farm bill, but that's how they're gonna sneak this 5G network in is through that farm bill that passed.
[03:04:37.208 --> 03:04:41.392]  But they also legalized hemp in the Farm Bill, so I actually don't even know what's in the Farm Bill.
[03:04:41.612 --> 03:04:50.081]  Well, Brad Parskill said that we have to bring out 5G technology immediately to everyone, and I like Brad Parskill, couldn't disagree with him more on that.
[03:04:50.762 --> 03:04:54.706]  They even say, we're not gonna study this, we're just gonna roll it out.
[03:04:54.726 --> 03:04:56.307]  I mean, what do you mean you're not gonna study it?
[03:04:57.068 --> 03:05:00.832]  Okay, fine, just roll it out, even though you know the microwave causes cancer.
[03:05:06.468 --> 03:05:09.313]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[03:05:09.333 --> 03:05:13.460]  But these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever, ever meet.
[03:05:13.500 --> 03:05:17.106]  But we're gonna punch through the media.
[03:05:17.166 --> 03:05:17.908]  We have to!
[03:05:20.219 --> 03:05:25.204]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[03:05:25.765 --> 03:05:30.550]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[03:05:31.391 --> 03:05:32.532]  We will not fail.
[03:05:33.453 --> 03:05:36.236]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[03:05:36.937 --> 03:05:38.338]  That whether we are black
[03:05:40.480 --> 03:05:45.506]  We all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[03:05:45.546 --> 03:05:49.069]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[03:05:49.490 --> 03:05:53.033]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[03:05:53.494 --> 03:05:54.375]  Victory for the world.
[03:06:14.022 --> 03:06:17.463]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:18.064 --> 03:06:22.605]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:23.065 --> 03:06:28.968]  You know, Alex Jones is not here live in studio today, but he really has done an amazing thing.
[03:06:29.928 --> 03:06:33.889]  Building Infowars, hiring all these great people.
[03:06:33.930 --> 03:06:35.090]  We've got such a great staff.
[03:06:35.130 --> 03:06:40.052]  Bringing in Roger Stone, bringing in Paul Joseph Watson, bringing in Dan Lyman, bringing in myself.
[03:06:41.858 --> 03:06:48.321]  It's really incredible and it's all possible with your support and I just, before I sign off today on this Friday, I just wanted to put that out there.
[03:06:48.861 --> 03:06:50.302]  The crew here is so amazing.
[03:06:51.622 --> 03:06:54.764]  You know, everything Alex has done here is really so incredible.
[03:06:54.824 --> 03:07:00.806]  I don't even know, even its most loyal listeners to the Alex Jones Show, even me!
[03:07:00.986 --> 03:07:02.487]  Even me that's in the middle of it!
[03:07:02.527 --> 03:07:06.229]  I don't even know if I really fully understand and appreciate what it is we're doing here every day.
[03:07:07.588 --> 03:07:09.089]  We're going to continue to fight the good fight.
[03:07:09.149 --> 03:07:11.030]  Thanks to all your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:07:11.410 --> 03:07:19.533]  I'm now joined by my co-host on The War Room, which is three to six weekdays here at Infowars.com slash show.
[03:07:19.914 --> 03:07:25.136]  Roger Stone and I host The War Room, which is going to be hosted by Jake Lloyd and Tyler Nixon today.
[03:07:26.417 --> 03:07:28.498]  And it's also the Veterans Call-In Show today.
[03:07:28.538 --> 03:07:34.580]  So if you don't get in on the Alex Jones Show today and you're a veteran, call into The War Room later and they'll be happy to take your calls.
[03:07:35.261 --> 03:07:35.741]  But Roger,
[03:07:37.082 --> 03:07:39.183]  It's really amazing everything that's going on here today.
[03:07:39.443 --> 03:07:40.564]  Big victories for Trump.
[03:07:41.304 --> 03:07:47.627]  He has the Jobs Act and Tax Cuts anniversary speech today.
[03:07:48.087 --> 03:07:55.611]  The DOJ criminally charges 76 doctors, 23 pharmacists, 19 nurses, part of a $2 billion medical fraud.
[03:07:55.631 --> 03:07:58.352]  I mean, these are massive victories today for President Trump.
[03:07:59.963 --> 03:08:03.226]  Well, and it's feeding the hysteria of the left.
[03:08:03.446 --> 03:08:08.550]  Look, Owen, 1 million new jobs created since Trump became president.
[03:08:09.311 --> 03:08:11.953]  228,000 in May alone.
[03:08:11.973 --> 03:08:22.401]  4% economic growth, which they told us was structurally impossible under Barack Obama, on the cusp of a historic peace deal in the Koreas.
[03:08:22.601 --> 03:08:29.607]  A deal which, if Barack Obama had done, they would be calling brilliant, but because Donald Trump did it, they're calling risky.
[03:08:30.456 --> 03:08:39.620]  Uh, cashing in the Iran nuclear deal, which was a rip off of America and a deal between us and a group of people we cannot trust.
[03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:50.185]  So, uh, as the president becomes more popular and as America begins to get greater again, the left becomes more and more hysterical.
[03:08:50.689 --> 03:08:58.431]  Before you sign off, though, I have to compliment you on today's necktie, which is even better than yesterday's necktie.
[03:08:58.871 --> 03:09:05.413]  This is considered a classic rep stripe, an absolute winner at all times.
[03:09:05.773 --> 03:09:07.114]  So my hat's off to you.
[03:09:07.254 --> 03:09:11.715]  Your sartorial taste today is particularly on point.
[03:09:12.555 --> 03:09:13.175]  There he goes.
[03:09:13.796 --> 03:09:18.677]  Owen Schroeder, one of the internationally best dressed men in America.
[03:09:19.404 --> 03:09:41.466]  I do want to suggest that if you are a veteran, they would love to hear from you on today's War Room, where Jake Lloyd and my friend Tyler Nixon will be taking calls between 3 and 6 Central Time, that's 4 and 7 Eastern Time, at the War Room in our special Veterans Call-In Program.
[03:09:42.106 --> 03:09:50.968]  We'd like to hear from you, if you've served your country, and we'd like to hear about your frustrations, your aspirations, and your thoughts.
[03:09:51.488 --> 03:10:04.311]  So today, on The War Room, our special Veterans Call-In Program with Jake Lloyd and Tyler Nixon, pinch-hitting for Owen and I. Please, let us hear from you.
[03:10:05.266 --> 03:10:13.496]  Uh, this has been a momentous week because Rod Rosenstein's derriere is on the grill.
[03:10:13.956 --> 03:10:24.368]  And I think it was apparent to virtually everyone yesterday who is running the cover up for the Obama administration, who is the point man to hide the fact
[03:10:24.788 --> 03:10:44.746]  That the Obama Department of Justice and the Obama FBI, in concert with the Hillary Clinton campaign, used illegal and unconstitutional FISA warrants as the legal rationale for the spying on Donald Trump and his associates, including yours truly.
[03:10:45.827 --> 03:11:03.252]  As the cover-up becomes unraveling, as the economy improves, as Trump's success becomes more manifest, the left becomes more and more hysterical, manifesting itself in the violence we see around the country.
[03:11:03.852 --> 03:11:05.153]  No, I'm sorry.
[03:11:05.473 --> 03:11:13.779]  The tragic deaths at the Capital Gazette were caused by a man who had a grudge against that newspaper and was clearly mentally unbalanced.
[03:11:14.200 --> 03:11:16.121]  It has nothing to do with politics.
[03:11:16.461 --> 03:11:18.703]  It has nothing to do with Donald Trump.
[03:11:19.123 --> 03:11:22.126]  But the left will use any excuse whatsoever.
[03:11:22.646 --> 03:11:25.768]  If it rains, they will blame President Trump.
[03:11:26.149 --> 03:11:29.371]  The American people, fortunately, see right through it.
[03:11:30.207 --> 03:11:33.629]  I'm going to take your calls today, and that number, 877-789-2539.
[03:11:33.649 --> 03:11:33.889]  Again, 877-789-2539.
[03:11:33.909 --> 03:11:37.191]  The phone lines are open, and we want to hear from you.
[03:11:37.231 --> 03:11:41.293]  I like the call-in format, so let's start with John in Kansas City.
[03:11:41.313 --> 03:11:42.653]  John, what's on your mind?
[03:11:42.673 --> 03:11:43.214]  You there, Roger?
[03:12:00.205 --> 03:12:00.808]  Yes, indeed.
[03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.812]  Go ahead, John.
[03:12:01.893 --> 03:12:02.375]  It's an honor.
[03:12:03.815 --> 03:12:05.575]  Hey, I've been wondering this forever.
[03:12:05.895 --> 03:12:10.956]  When you get on there to mainstream media, I noticed you were on Ingram several times over the last couple months.
[03:12:11.016 --> 03:12:13.257]  I've seen YouTube clips of you on CNN.
[03:12:13.737 --> 03:12:24.239]  And you get up there, but before you go in there, do they, um, do they, do they sit you down and say, okay, Roger, now we're not going to talk about Seth Rich or false flags or anything like that, are we?
[03:12:24.639 --> 03:12:27.559]  Or is it just sort of an understood thing, you know, not to go there?
[03:12:27.959 --> 03:12:31.620]  Or do you try to get your zingers in only to have them cut you off and edit it out?
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:32.920]  How does that go on?
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:33.661]  How does that work?
[03:12:33.701 --> 03:12:36.501]  Well, they don't censor you in any way.
[03:12:36.701 --> 03:12:40.142]  I do know that they don't want you to talk about Seth Rich.
[03:12:40.202 --> 03:12:42.803]  And frankly, I have other points to make.
[03:12:42.943 --> 03:12:53.506]  I do make it a point every time I possibly can to mention InfoWars and the extraordinary struggle that we're going through in a war against censorship.
[03:12:54.244 --> 03:13:10.568]  When Alex Jones tells you that they are trying to use these phony harassment lawsuits as a rationale to get us wiped off the face of the internet, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, he's not kidding.
[03:13:11.278 --> 03:13:16.700]  We're not exaggerating the war that is being waged on InfoWars.
[03:13:17.221 --> 03:13:27.345]  I'm not exaggerating the war that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is waging against me because they want to silence Alex Jones.
[03:13:27.665 --> 03:13:29.506]  Because they want to silence me.
[03:13:29.866 --> 03:13:35.649]  Because they don't want us to point out the partisan nature of the Mueller investigation
[03:13:36.229 --> 03:13:43.512]  And the fact that they are covering up for the largest political scandal in American history.
[03:13:43.812 --> 03:13:56.857]  But I can honestly say, whether it is Sean Hannity's show, which I was on last week, or Tucker Carlson's show, which I was on the week before, or Laura Ingraham's angle that I was on last night,
[03:13:57.535 --> 03:13:59.556]  I have never been censored.
[03:13:59.876 --> 03:14:03.317]  They have never told me what I can and cannot talk about.
[03:14:03.737 --> 03:14:09.219]  And I always try to make a point to tell people about the great stuff we're doing here at InfoWars.
[03:14:09.559 --> 03:14:12.280]  Thank you, John, so much for your call.
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:15.021]  Let's go to Frank in the District of Columbia.
[03:14:15.061 --> 03:14:17.822]  We've got about a minute, almost two minutes.
[03:14:17.922 --> 03:14:18.562]  Go ahead, Frank.
[03:14:18.602 --> 03:14:20.423]  We'll try to get your question in.
[03:14:20.463 --> 03:14:22.424]  If not, I'll answer the rest on the other side.
[03:14:22.784 --> 03:14:23.244]  Go ahead.
[03:14:24.505 --> 03:14:25.565]  Roger, it's good to talk to you.
[03:14:27.366 --> 03:14:30.628]  I have a question that Owen keeps asking.
[03:14:30.688 --> 03:14:38.331]  He keeps asking why that the Rosenstein gets to say that he's trying to produce the documents for the Oversight Committee, but he never produces these things on time.
[03:14:38.351 --> 03:14:56.200]  And my thought is this must be the Peter Strzok insurance policy in action where they claim because there's an ongoing investigation, the Mueller investigation, they get to redact documents even from the Oversight Committee just because they want to preserve the integrity of the investigation that shouldn't be going on.
[03:14:56.980 --> 03:14:57.681]  That seem logical?
[03:14:58.901 --> 03:15:00.863]  Yeah, I think that's the rationale they use.
[03:15:00.883 --> 03:15:04.485]  Look, Rosenstein is the key point man in the cover-up.
[03:15:04.926 --> 03:15:06.927]  He's the guy breaking the law today.
[03:15:07.367 --> 03:15:15.133]  The real question is, given his refusal to turn over information, which is the linchpin of the entire conspiracy against Trump,
[03:15:15.737 --> 03:15:16.778]  The FISA warrants.
[03:15:17.198 --> 03:15:19.759]  Why hasn't the president terminated him?
[03:15:20.220 --> 03:15:23.922]  Why hasn't the president shut down the Mueller investigation?
[03:15:23.982 --> 03:15:31.946]  Which is indeed, exactly as the president says, a witch hunt designed to undo what they could not do at the ballot box in 2016.
[03:15:33.307 --> 03:15:42.830]  Bloomberg reports yesterday that Mueller is going to decide about bringing charges in his final report against the president in the fall.
[03:15:43.250 --> 03:15:43.590]  Really?
[03:15:44.110 --> 03:15:45.771]  Just before the November election?
[03:15:46.191 --> 03:15:48.271]  What could be the timing involved there?
[03:15:48.732 --> 03:15:53.793]  The day before, Bloomberg reported that Mueller is now going to focus on Russian collusion.
[03:15:54.514 --> 03:15:55.054]  Wait a minute!
[03:15:55.354 --> 03:16:00.077]  I thought that's what he's been focusing on for the last two years at the cost of millions.
[03:16:00.457 --> 03:16:01.758]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:16:01.798 --> 03:16:03.038]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:03.058 --> 03:16:16.745]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[03:16:19.261 --> 03:16:25.367]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[03:16:26.788 --> 03:16:29.310]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[03:16:30.111 --> 03:16:33.534]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[03:16:34.475 --> 03:16:36.657]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[03:16:38.358 --> 03:16:43.503]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[03:16:45.461 --> 03:16:52.066]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[03:16:53.047 --> 03:16:54.047]  It's up to us personally.
[03:16:55.428 --> 03:17:02.274]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[03:17:02.794 --> 03:17:04.095]  I expected that to happen.
[03:17:05.256 --> 03:17:06.597]  This is 21st century warfare.
[03:17:08.587 --> 03:17:19.512]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[03:17:20.213 --> 03:17:21.753]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[03:17:22.454 --> 03:17:34.079]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[03:17:34.660 --> 03:17:36.841]  And we've already come so far together
[03:17:37.881 --> 03:17:46.888]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[03:17:47.468 --> 03:17:52.873]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[03:17:54.014 --> 03:18:01.900]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[03:18:04.113 --> 03:18:12.382]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[03:18:12.782 --> 03:18:14.364]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[03:18:15.365 --> 03:18:18.028]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[03:18:18.829 --> 03:18:20.651]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[03:18:20.691 --> 03:18:25.576]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[03:18:26.657 --> 03:18:37.408]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[03:18:37.488 --> 03:18:41.452]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[03:18:42.879 --> 03:18:43.519]  Our game changing.
[03:18:43.940 --> 03:18:45.440]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[03:18:45.641 --> 03:18:46.801]  The other equation of probiotic.
[03:18:46.861 --> 03:18:50.403]  It's now stronger and a lower price in FullWorthStore.com.
[03:18:50.723 --> 03:18:51.844]  We've got the real red pill.
[03:18:51.924 --> 03:18:56.266]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[03:18:56.826 --> 03:18:59.868]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[03:18:59.948 --> 03:19:01.189]  It just does incredible things.
[03:19:01.609 --> 03:19:03.070]  Look into the real red pill for yourself.
[03:19:03.090 --> 03:19:06.051]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[03:19:06.091 --> 03:19:08.613]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:19:09.133 --> 03:19:13.954]  That's 4 to 5 of Choletal Silver and Iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[03:19:14.574 --> 03:19:33.039]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of Choletal Silver out there, Silver Sol, Nano Silver, Iodine, the Ionized Water, Stevia, Peppermint, Essential Oil, and so much more.
[03:19:33.319 --> 03:19:35.480]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:20:05.985 --> 03:20:10.128]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.111 --> 03:20:18.595]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:20:18.615 --> 03:20:19.556]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:34.474 --> 03:20:35.215]  Welcome back.
[03:20:35.635 --> 03:20:39.298]  You're on the Alex Jones Show here at InfoWars.
[03:20:39.378 --> 03:20:41.140]  It's the house that Alex built.
[03:20:41.880 --> 03:20:46.484]  I'm your pinch-hitting host today, Roger Stone, and glad to be with you.
[03:20:47.005 --> 03:20:53.830]  We're taking your phone calls today at 877-789-2539.
[03:20:55.011 --> 03:20:58.794]  We'd love to hear from you and hear what's on your mind.
[03:20:59.175 --> 03:21:02.858]  So let's go back to the call board and start with Mike in California.
[03:21:03.359 --> 03:21:04.740]  Mike, you're on the line.
[03:21:05.661 --> 03:21:06.041]  Hey, Roger.
[03:21:06.221 --> 03:21:07.142]  Pleasure to speak with you, bud.
[03:21:08.122 --> 03:21:10.264]  Thanks for calling in.
[03:21:10.484 --> 03:21:11.405]  I had two points.
[03:21:11.465 --> 03:21:14.247]  I had one question I wanted to ask Owen, but I guess he's not around right now.
[03:21:14.527 --> 03:21:21.372]  But before this whole congressional thing gets too far away, I know there was a lot of fire yesterday, but I thought it was interesting.
[03:21:21.412 --> 03:21:23.033]  I believe his name was Congressman Ratcliffe.
[03:21:23.073 --> 03:21:25.354]  He asked Rodenstein an interesting question.
[03:21:25.414 --> 03:21:30.218]  He said, what makes you the arbiter of what Congress needs to see or what they can and cannot see?
[03:21:31.261 --> 03:21:33.083]  And it was just glazed right over.
[03:21:33.103 --> 03:21:36.425]  I believe another congressman interrupted and it just went back and forth.
[03:21:36.485 --> 03:21:38.226]  And there's never an answer to that.
[03:21:38.427 --> 03:21:49.475]  So if the three branches of government are supposed to be equal but separate, I'm sure if the DOJ wanted to subpoena anything from Congress, they would have to jump within hours, minutes on it.
[03:21:51.236 --> 03:21:54.799]  Well, the problem that you have, of course, is the enforcement mechanism.
[03:21:55.699 --> 03:21:56.800]  The Congress really has
[03:21:58.328 --> 03:22:05.191]  On paper, the power to compel a co-equal branch of government, the executive, to produce this paper.
[03:22:05.671 --> 03:22:09.993]  But if Mr. Rosenstein refuses, they have only two choices.
[03:22:10.613 --> 03:22:25.140]  They can refer contempt charges to the Justice Department that will then decide not to prosecute, or they can move to impeach Mr. Rosenstein, but that requires a two-thirds vote of the U.S.
[03:22:25.200 --> 03:22:25.520]  Senate.
[03:22:26.010 --> 03:22:27.991]  Look, Rosenstein is a criminal.
[03:22:28.372 --> 03:22:36.277]  He's involved in a criminal conspiracy to cover up illegal acts and unconstitutional acts by the Obama administration.
[03:22:36.777 --> 03:22:38.458]  How did he get this appointment?
[03:22:38.518 --> 03:22:41.820]  Remember, he serves at the pleasure of the President.
[03:22:41.960 --> 03:22:52.507]  The truth is, Reince Priebus, who was briefly the President's Chief of Staff, an establishment Republican quizling, recommended Rod Rosenstein for this job
[03:22:53.107 --> 03:23:05.677]  At the recommendation, I hope you're sitting down, of Congressman Elijah Cummings, one of the most stout Trump haters in the United States Congress, a Democratic congressman from Baltimore.
[03:23:06.138 --> 03:23:09.581]  Why would the president appoint scum like Rosenstein?
[03:23:09.961 --> 03:23:13.003]  That is the question, but today there's a better question.
[03:23:13.404 --> 03:23:19.889]  Why hasn't he been terminated and a new Attorney General put in place?
[03:23:20.606 --> 03:23:40.810]  I recommend at this point that the President dismiss Jeff Sessions, who is either compromised or senile, dismiss Mr. Rosenstein, and appoint, because he may be too old for a Supreme Court nomination, Judge Andrew Napolitano as the new Attorney General.
[03:23:41.270 --> 03:23:44.130]  And if he doesn't want to take the job, then former U.S.
[03:23:44.190 --> 03:23:48.031]  Attorney Andrew McCarthy as the new Attorney General.
[03:23:48.471 --> 03:23:59.558]  Both of them men committed to the rule of law who would see to the prosecution of those covering up the greatest political scandal in American history.
[03:23:59.979 --> 03:24:06.823]  The use of the power and authority of the state to spy on Donald Trump's campaign for president
[03:24:07.279 --> 03:24:11.322]  And wire the 2016 election for Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:11.703 --> 03:24:13.944]  Thank you very much for your call.
[03:24:14.205 --> 03:24:15.466]  Let's go back to the boards.
[03:24:15.666 --> 03:24:18.108]  How about Jim in Washington State?
[03:24:18.208 --> 03:24:19.429]  Jim, what's on your mind?
[03:24:21.591 --> 03:24:21.771]  Yeah.
[03:24:21.791 --> 03:24:22.371]  Hi, Roger.
[03:24:22.672 --> 03:24:23.672]  Actually, it's Jim.
[03:24:24.393 --> 03:24:28.496]  And we're coming to you from Global Region One, FEMA District 10.
[03:24:29.417 --> 03:24:35.642]  And I wanted to comment about yesterday you mentioned about a keystone taking the keystone out.
[03:24:36.463 --> 03:24:36.683]  Yes.
[03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:45.652]  And what I was going to tell you is you guys should look into, several people have mentioned it, it's a group in the government called SES.
[03:24:46.372 --> 03:24:54.815]  And if you have your guys look it up, their emblem, they actually have a flag, is of a keystone with a fifth column in the keystone.
[03:24:55.296 --> 03:25:04.899]  And all these major players from Huber, Mueller, Comey, Rosenstein, and Sessions has been an SES member since 1984.
[03:25:07.845 --> 03:25:13.970]  And there's a way that Trump can get rid of them really easy through this Holman Act.
[03:25:14.490 --> 03:25:17.573]  With the sign of a pen, he can reduce all of their pay to $1.
[03:25:17.693 --> 03:25:31.103]  And then one other thing that you might be able to do is, if you could, I'd have Trump go on the old fence and start just laying out some of Mueller's crimes.
[03:25:31.678 --> 03:25:43.525]  You know, like he could give it to Sarah Sanders to give to, instead of being on the defense all the time at these press conferences, why don't you have Sarah Sanders, like, give out the information?
[03:25:43.545 --> 03:25:55.833]  Because we have the documents of Mueller on the tarmac in Copenhagen with the nuclear stuff and tons of other stuff from the boards and the amount of money he has.
[03:25:55.853 --> 03:25:57.454]  What do you think of those ideas?
[03:25:58.126 --> 03:26:00.089]  Well, it's very interesting what you say.
[03:26:00.129 --> 03:26:07.298]  I mean, Mr. Mueller is a man who, as FBI director, arrested the long three suspects in the anthrax matter.
[03:26:07.879 --> 03:26:11.484]  And the man he did ultimately arrest then died suspiciously in custody.
[03:26:12.236 --> 03:26:22.459]  This is the same Robert Mueller who let three men rot who we knew were innocent in a Boston jail to cover up for FBI mob informants.
[03:26:23.059 --> 03:26:31.962]  This is the same Jeffrey Epstein, pardon me, this is the same Robert Mueller who had pedophile Jeffrey Epstein on the FBI payroll.
[03:26:32.502 --> 03:26:37.965]  As an informant and allowing him to dodge additional child trafficking charges.
[03:26:38.485 --> 03:26:50.890]  This is the same Robert Mueller who failed to investigate reports of a Sarasota, Florida-based flight school where five of nine of the 9-11 hijackers were training.
[03:26:51.370 --> 03:27:01.355]  And as you point out, the same Robert Mueller who muled the uranium-1 uranium specimens to the Russians for examination.
[03:27:01.955 --> 03:27:02.875]  Who is the criminal?
[03:27:03.195 --> 03:27:05.236]  Mr. Mueller is the criminal.
[03:27:05.516 --> 03:27:09.156]  I think it's very important the American people know that track record.
[03:27:09.256 --> 03:27:09.997]  So I agree.
[03:27:10.377 --> 03:27:12.577]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:27:12.937 --> 03:27:15.117]  Let's go to Jim in California.
[03:27:15.418 --> 03:27:16.978]  Jim, what's on your mind?
[03:27:18.898 --> 03:27:19.738]  How you doing, Roger?
[03:27:20.618 --> 03:27:20.999]  Excellent.
[03:27:21.799 --> 03:27:23.199]  What's your question for us, Jim?
[03:27:24.559 --> 03:27:28.680]  Well, I just after seeing all that I see that being
[03:27:29.395 --> 03:27:36.921]  Are you excited to see that we're in these last days that this will come to a screeching halt by a big surprise for everybody?
[03:27:48.817 --> 03:27:51.339]  Well, I think Alex Jones is absolutely right.
[03:27:51.639 --> 03:27:57.184]  We are winning, but we will not continue to win without your loyal support.

[03:28:50.334 --> 03:28:51.434]  We need your support.
[03:28:51.794 --> 03:28:56.255]  We do not exaggerate the danger of what we do here at InfoWars.
[03:28:56.295 --> 03:29:02.236]  So please, go buy the site now, whether it is my book, Stone's Rules, or any of these other great products.

[03:30:10.749 --> 03:30:11.330]  Good, how are you?
[03:30:11.530 --> 03:30:15.733]  Alright, I heard y'all was racist, so I came to get my own free coffee.
[03:30:16.253 --> 03:30:16.754]  I saw that.
[03:30:17.274 --> 03:30:22.578]  Yeah, I heard you guys don't like black people, so I wanted to get my Starbucks reparations voucher.
[03:30:24.179 --> 03:30:24.539]  What's that?
[03:30:24.619 --> 03:30:25.320]  Is that a real thing?
[03:30:25.720 --> 03:30:26.441]  It's a real thing.
[03:30:26.521 --> 03:30:27.862]  I mean, I'll give it to you.
[03:30:27.962 --> 03:30:29.603]  I saw that on my Twitter last night.
[03:30:29.623 --> 03:30:30.744]  I was like, what for?
[03:30:30.804 --> 03:30:31.924]  Yeah, I need a free coffee.
[03:30:31.964 --> 03:30:32.705]  I'll get you a free coffee.
[03:30:33.821 --> 03:30:34.042]  Yeah.
[03:30:34.883 --> 03:30:35.804]  Reparations, man.
[03:30:35.824 --> 03:30:39.309]  Gotta get my reparations for being black in America.
[03:30:39.649 --> 03:30:44.295]  Black lives matter.
[03:30:45.056 --> 03:30:46.057]  I'll take caramel.
[03:30:48.519 --> 03:30:48.999]  What's your name?
[03:30:49.019 --> 03:30:49.860]  I appreciate you.
[03:30:50.120 --> 03:30:50.580]  Amanda?
[03:30:50.820 --> 03:30:52.001]  Amanda, you are great.
[03:30:52.041 --> 03:30:52.541]  Is it?
[03:30:52.661 --> 03:30:54.041]  You're amazing.
[03:30:54.061 --> 03:30:55.102]  Thank you.
[03:30:55.122 --> 03:30:56.923]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:30:56.943 --> 03:30:58.783]  You gotta get your free coffee out here, man.
[03:30:58.803 --> 03:31:01.565]  You gotta get your Starbucks reparations, man.
[03:31:02.165 --> 03:31:03.445]  Uh, Hotep Jesus was the man.
[03:31:03.646 --> 03:31:06.747]  So he got the brilliant idea to go into a Starbucks and demand a coffee.
[03:31:06.767 --> 03:31:07.687]  Otherwise, they're racist.
[03:31:07.987 --> 03:31:10.048]  He's gonna go get a free chocolate chip cookie after the show.
[03:31:10.288 --> 03:31:12.449]  So there's... Oh, he got his Starbucks mug right there.
[03:31:12.729 --> 03:31:13.670]  Was that a free Joe?
[03:31:16.880 --> 03:31:20.403]  This was the free joke.
[03:31:20.484 --> 03:31:27.450]  So we need to get that cup and put that cup in a glass case and save it for all eternity.
[03:31:27.490 --> 03:31:28.291]  There it is right there.
[03:31:28.591 --> 03:31:29.893]  Oh, they even put your name on there!
[03:31:30.774 --> 03:31:31.734]  That's a great picture!
[03:31:35.467 --> 03:31:38.710]  You know, I understand liberal politics.
[03:31:39.450 --> 03:31:43.254]  I've been studying it for a while now and understand that.
[03:31:43.574 --> 03:31:44.635]  And I've tweeted this before.
[03:31:44.655 --> 03:31:57.826]  I said, if an individual, especially a black individual, wants to excel in this society, they should follow the liberal narrative and all doors and opportunities will be open to them.
[03:31:58.906 --> 03:32:00.688]  And I knew it would work.
[03:32:01.332 --> 03:32:03.193]  So I decided, you know, I said, you know what?
[03:32:03.473 --> 03:32:04.673]  I'm standing here by this Starbucks.
[03:32:04.713 --> 03:32:06.034]  I had this idea in my mind.
[03:32:06.394 --> 03:32:08.435]  I said, let's test this thing out and see what happens.
[03:32:08.815 --> 03:32:10.915]  The video started to go viral on Periscope.
[03:32:11.336 --> 03:32:12.056]  And now here we are.
[03:32:12.836 --> 03:32:18.998]  I wasn't mad at Starbucks at first, but now I'm mad at Starbucks for this racial bias training.
[03:32:19.739 --> 03:32:20.719]  And I'm going to tell you why.
[03:32:21.545 --> 03:32:24.808]  First of all, what does Eric Holder know about Black people?
[03:32:25.209 --> 03:32:29.553]  What does the NAACP or the ADL know about Black people?
[03:32:29.773 --> 03:32:31.875]  The Black people really suck one in the hood.
[03:32:32.095 --> 03:32:38.461]  You see, Black Lives Matter, NAACP, and Eric Holder are not the voice of Black people.
[03:32:38.721 --> 03:32:43.306]  That is the bourgeoisie that keep Black people down.
[03:32:43.626 --> 03:32:44.507]  And Starbucks
[03:32:44.847 --> 03:32:46.828]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:15.365 --> 03:33:27.513]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:33:28.073 --> 03:33:29.714]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:33:31.693 --> 03:33:34.915]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.195 --> 03:33:42.100]  I'm your host, pitch hitting for Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and glad to be with you.
[03:33:42.620 --> 03:33:56.749]  We're taking your calls, but before we go there, I want to remind you that today, from three to six central, we have our special Veterans Call-In Show being co-hosted by Jake Lloyd and Tyler Nixon.
[03:33:57.189 --> 03:34:00.912]  If you've served our country, we want to hear from you with your
[03:34:01.452 --> 03:34:04.794]  Complaints, your aspirations, and your observations.
[03:34:05.154 --> 03:34:11.817]  So please, tune into the War Room today for the very special Veterans Call-In Show.
[03:34:12.398 --> 03:34:20.162]  I also want to say that if you want to help the Info Wars, you can purchase my new book, Stone's Rules, at the
[03:34:21.102 --> 03:34:23.903]  Infowars.com store.
[03:34:23.923 --> 03:34:26.805]  And we have a very special offer for you.
[03:34:27.305 --> 03:34:39.230]  Whether you want to succeed at business, politics, fashion, media, IT, agriculture, or any other chosen avocation, this is the rulebook you need.
[03:34:39.350 --> 03:34:42.672]  This is the field manual for success.
[03:34:43.232 --> 03:35:06.425]  And if you buy it at the Infowars.com store and mail your book to 1007 North Federal Highway, number 166, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33304, there you see it, it'll be my privilege to send it back to you signed and personalized.
[03:35:06.826 --> 03:35:08.847]  If you want to just send a book plate,
[03:35:09.507 --> 03:35:13.208]  Which can be pasted into the front of your book because you just don't want to part with it.
[03:35:13.608 --> 03:35:14.729]  We can do that, too.
[03:35:15.169 --> 03:35:21.571]  This morning, I signed and mailed over 40 books and book plates and it was my honor to do so.
[03:35:21.971 --> 03:35:29.353]  This special officer offer is only available to those who buy the book at the Infowars.com store today.
[03:35:29.633 --> 03:35:32.914]  Again, Stone's Rules at a very good price.
[03:35:33.494 --> 03:35:39.057]  With the additional benefit of getting an autographed copy for your personal library.
[03:35:39.397 --> 03:35:41.078]  Again, mail your book to P.O.
[03:35:41.118 --> 03:35:49.643]  Box, 1007 North Federal Highway, number 166, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33304.
[03:35:52.485 --> 03:35:58.128]  Let's go back to the call board now, and I'd like to hear from Karen in Ohio.
[03:35:58.548 --> 03:35:59.809]  Karen, what's on your mind?
[03:36:00.365 --> 03:36:05.189]  Well, one thing is I want to tell you that I appreciate you guys immensely.
[03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:11.274]  The other thing is, my father was a forward observer in World War II.
[03:36:12.154 --> 03:36:15.457]  He was an amazing man, lucky to have come back.
[03:36:15.557 --> 03:36:19.240]  As you know, they didn't have, you know, those were the guys they wanted to take out.
[03:36:20.080 --> 03:36:28.267]  And he always, when I went to school, always told me if I learned something that was communist philosophy,
[03:36:29.278 --> 03:36:34.140]  Nowadays, these kids don't even know that they're buying into communist philosophy.
[03:36:34.440 --> 03:36:36.261]  Their parents have been indoctrinated.
[03:36:36.741 --> 03:36:38.102]  They have been indoctrinated.
[03:36:38.562 --> 03:36:45.886]  Now, the one thing that I was very, very upset about is that it seems that a religion that
[03:36:47.188 --> 03:36:54.130]  You know, that people at churches are now being, you know, led astray as well.
[03:36:54.230 --> 03:37:16.836]  My daughter-in-law wrote to Deseret News when they reported the same thing, you know, that Time Magazine did, and she told them the true story about how this woman's child was not separated from her and how the father actually saw his child on TV and was able to find out his wife had taken
[03:37:17.336 --> 03:37:20.299]  His daughter and left three other children at home.
[03:37:21.139 --> 03:37:25.943]  And they wrote back and said they wouldn't print what she wrote.
[03:37:25.963 --> 03:37:27.665]  They said it was supposition.
[03:37:28.625 --> 03:37:31.828]  And so the deception today is so scary.
[03:37:32.889 --> 03:37:40.075]  I wish I knew what to do, you know, at church, at, you know, with the schools.
[03:37:40.555 --> 03:37:44.979]  You know, I want to be able to do something, you know.
[03:37:46.246 --> 03:37:47.727]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[03:37:47.767 --> 03:37:48.868]  Let me speak to it.
[03:37:49.308 --> 03:37:53.071]  It's amazing what kids coming out of the public schools today don't know.
[03:37:53.872 --> 03:37:55.733]  They're not taught American history.
[03:37:56.326 --> 03:37:58.587]  They don't know who George Washington is.
[03:37:59.147 --> 03:38:03.229]  They don't understand the struggle and sacrifice of the founding fathers.
[03:38:04.109 --> 03:38:06.530]  They don't know about Abraham Lincoln.
[03:38:06.930 --> 03:38:10.132]  They don't know about Dwight Eisenhower.
[03:38:10.472 --> 03:38:13.893]  They don't know about the triumph of World War II.
[03:38:14.733 --> 03:38:16.074]  It is disgraceful.
[03:38:16.678 --> 03:38:17.639]  What can you do?
[03:38:17.659 --> 03:38:31.278]  Well, one of the most important things you can do is take the most compelling links to the stories that you see here at InfoWars and spread them on your Facebook page, on your Twitter page,
[03:38:31.758 --> 03:38:33.640]  On your Instagram page.
[03:38:34.081 --> 03:38:39.928]  And you can share them via email with your friends and urge them to post them.
[03:38:40.288 --> 03:38:43.893]  You see, they can try to censor us here at InfoWars.
[03:38:44.293 --> 03:38:46.276]  And God knows they are trying.
[03:38:47.216 --> 03:38:49.438]  But they cannot censor all of us.
[03:38:49.878 --> 03:38:52.920]  You are a committee of freedom, of one.
[03:38:53.600 --> 03:38:55.801]  One person can be effective.
[03:38:56.202 --> 03:39:02.345]  The only thing that needs to happen for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing.
[03:39:02.845 --> 03:39:10.670]  So when you see a compelling story that conveys the truth, here at InfoWars, spread the word.
[03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:12.531]  Spread the links.
[03:39:12.891 --> 03:39:15.292]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:39:15.653 --> 03:39:17.794]  Let's go to Antoine in Texas.
[03:39:18.134 --> 03:39:18.814]  He's still with us.
[03:39:19.275 --> 03:39:21.716]  And pardon me, Antoine in California.
[03:39:21.816 --> 03:39:23.137]  Antoine, what's on your mind?
[03:39:24.258 --> 03:39:25.058]  Hey, Roger.
[03:39:25.098 --> 03:39:25.678]  How you doing?
[03:39:26.479 --> 03:39:26.879]  Excellent.
[03:39:27.299 --> 03:39:28.020]  Talk to us, brother.
[03:39:29.221 --> 03:39:31.843]  Well, I've been sort of having some problems.
[03:39:31.903 --> 03:39:35.787]  I remember calling back in about 2005 to Alex Jones.
[03:39:36.107 --> 03:39:43.733]  He wanted to know from his audience who he could vote for, and he was mainly going for Ted Cruz.
[03:39:44.214 --> 03:39:48.257]  At that time, I was telling him to go with Donald Trump.
[03:39:48.758 --> 03:39:52.160]  So after I called, he had decided to basically go with Donald Trump.
[03:39:52.180 --> 03:39:56.464]  He didn't quite like him at that time, but I didn't think I would get any trouble for that.
[03:39:59.386 --> 03:40:05.230]  So yeah, I basically, you know, have ran into some problems since then.
[03:40:05.390 --> 03:40:06.711]  I'm not the type to complain.
[03:40:06.771 --> 03:40:13.216]  I've been calling in for years now and I've seen a lot of people complain and they just, you know, it didn't seem right.
[03:40:13.576 --> 03:40:21.802]  But yeah, you know, I'm in a town in San Francisco, I think it's Robert Mueller's, like, hometown where he went to college or something.
[03:40:22.242 --> 03:40:22.763]  We're good.
[03:40:36.826 --> 03:40:37.266]  I think so.
[03:40:54.494 --> 03:40:54.894]  We're good to go.
[03:41:11.613 --> 03:41:12.693]  We're good to go.
[03:41:25.936 --> 03:41:28.919]  Inside, you know, the wrong location.
[03:41:28.959 --> 03:41:31.281]  Because I can vouch for some of these people in San Francisco.
[03:41:31.641 --> 03:41:33.663]  They really weren't that hate-filled.
[03:41:33.823 --> 03:41:34.884]  There was nobody.
[03:41:34.904 --> 03:41:36.526]  You know, there aren't even any Republicans.
[03:41:36.846 --> 03:41:39.909]  But, you know, as for myself, it's getting pretty gruesome.
[03:41:39.969 --> 03:41:41.851]  I mean, it's just crazy out here.
[03:41:41.871 --> 03:41:42.311]  What do you think?
[03:41:43.432 --> 03:41:43.753]  All right.
[03:41:43.813 --> 03:41:45.894]  Well, Antoine, thank you for your call.
[03:41:46.035 --> 03:41:51.720]  I know exactly what you're talking about, because I've seen the violence and the threats ratcheting up.
[03:41:52.384 --> 03:41:54.486]  I used to travel the country alone.
[03:41:54.626 --> 03:41:55.867]  I can no longer do that.
[03:41:56.347 --> 03:42:05.694]  I'm now required to travel with a bodyguard, sometimes two, because of people costing me in airports, on the streets, in restaurants.
[03:42:06.104 --> 03:42:10.089]  We've seen what happened to Milo Yiannopoulos.
[03:42:10.450 --> 03:42:13.033]  We've seen what happened to Sarah Sanders.
[03:42:13.614 --> 03:42:19.682]  The left is getting increasingly hysterical with the success of this administration.
[03:42:20.143 --> 03:42:23.728]  So I know what it's like to be persecuted for supporting Donald Trump.
[03:42:24.368 --> 03:42:46.181]  I have a federal prosecutor in my financial records, in my taxes, in every aspect of my personal life, even as we speak, seeking to find some phony, bogus offense to indict me for, or should I say frame me for, to get me off of InfoWars, to get me off of Fox.
[03:42:46.681 --> 03:42:53.465]  To get me off of the airwaves where I criticize the partisan nature of the Mueller investigation.
[03:42:53.985 --> 03:42:54.805]  Let me say this.
[03:42:55.426 --> 03:42:57.887]  We are the tip of the spear here at Infowars.
[03:42:58.327 --> 03:42:59.748]  We will never fold.
[03:43:00.148 --> 03:43:01.309]  We will never quit.
[03:43:03.923 --> 03:43:22.234]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:22.314 --> 03:43:28.258]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:28.618 --> 03:43:29.299]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:29.399 --> 03:43:32.561]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:33.201 --> 03:43:34.182]  And so much more.
[03:43:34.742 --> 03:43:35.883]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:36.104 --> 03:43:37.845]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:37.925 --> 03:43:43.529]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:43.650 --> 03:43:44.830]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:44.850 --> 03:43:46.792]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:46.872 --> 03:43:49.254]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:49.454 --> 03:43:50.735]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:50.895 --> 03:43:52.717]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:53.277 --> 03:43:53.878]  Immune Wall.
[03:43:53.978 --> 03:43:55.279]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:55.419 --> 03:43:56.580]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:07.009 --> 03:44:16.357]  A few years ago, ideas that we talked about were thought to be fringe ideas, radical ideas, extremist ideas.
[03:44:16.377 --> 03:44:18.939]  Those ideas are now mainstream.
[03:44:19.720 --> 03:44:22.783]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country.
[03:44:22.843 --> 03:44:33.972]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, in a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd!
[03:44:41.796 --> 03:44:45.658]  Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless c***.
[03:44:45.778 --> 03:44:49.839]  What's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women?
[03:44:49.999 --> 03:44:54.441]  One way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy, so please bring on the recession.
[03:44:54.601 --> 03:44:58.323]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[03:44:58.543 --> 03:45:03.185]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[03:45:08.721 --> 03:45:13.024]  It has been said that the Republican Party's testicles just dropped.
[03:45:13.985 --> 03:45:17.027]  That wasn't an Infowars.com ad you just saw.
[03:45:17.367 --> 03:45:19.488]  That was officially put out by the Republican Party.
[03:45:20.169 --> 03:45:33.498]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're finally getting the fact that the globalists are trying to start a violent revolution in this country and overthrow it and bring it down just like Venezuela and so many others that have fallen to socialism and communism.
[03:45:38.541 --> 03:45:39.141]  We're good.
[03:46:01.428 --> 03:46:04.770]  We need to be re-provisioned in this fight.
[03:46:05.150 --> 03:46:06.891]  We need to be able to fund our operation.
[03:46:07.431 --> 03:46:17.876]  And we make it easy with products like Super Blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, mouthwash, immune gargle, and so much more, fortified with cloyal silver.
[03:46:18.968 --> 03:46:24.830]  Fortified with the highest quality iodine, fortified with natural essential oils and more.
[03:46:25.491 --> 03:46:32.934]  You help your teeth, you help your body, you help your gums, you help your country, you help your planet through free market, free association.
[03:46:33.954 --> 03:46:40.577]  The products are 50% off right now going through our super sale that we're gonna have on July 4th.
[03:46:41.117 --> 03:46:45.219]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, this is where you finance
[03:46:46.124 --> 03:46:56.610]  The second American revolution with the United States now attempting to stop the global government empire, attempting to take back control of our destiny on a global scale.
[03:47:06.355 --> 03:47:09.017]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.015 --> 03:47:21.918]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:47:22.378 --> 03:47:26.300]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:26.881 --> 03:47:31.003]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:32.584 --> 03:47:35.806]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:36.427 --> 03:47:44.712]  Yesterday's New York Times reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is now seeking to subpoena an associate of mine named Andrew Miller.
[03:47:45.396 --> 03:47:54.480]  Mr. Miller has not worked with me for three years having gotten married and moved to Northern California and more recently relocated to St.
[03:47:54.520 --> 03:47:54.860]  Louis.
[03:47:55.381 --> 03:48:07.346]  He is not involved in my 2016 political activities other than the week of the convention in which he flew out to help Alex Jones and I in our street demonstrations in Cleveland.
[03:48:08.230 --> 03:48:16.595]  So why is the Special Counsel trying to subpoena an associate of mine who had nothing to do with the 2016 elections?
[03:48:17.555 --> 03:48:34.564]  Well, this is compounded by the fact that my tax attorney today got what can only be considered a threatening email from the Office of Special Counsel, proving my point, which is the Special Counsel's office has nothing to do with Russian collusion, the 2016 elections,
[03:48:36.045 --> 03:48:47.328]  They have no case against me for Russian collusion, or collaboration with WikiLeaks, or advanced knowledge of the release of John Podesta's emails.
[03:48:47.688 --> 03:48:50.488]  And therefore, they seek to frame me.
[03:48:50.808 --> 03:48:57.530]  Yes, to conjure up some bogus offense to get me off of InfoWars, to get me off of Fox,
[03:48:58.030 --> 03:49:07.280]  But more importantly, to pressure me into testifying against Donald Trump, a man I have known intimately for almost 40 years.
[03:49:08.021 --> 03:49:10.644]  I have no choice now to appeal to you.
[03:49:11.264 --> 03:49:16.130]  My legal bills, due to the House and Senate Intelligence Committee witch hunts,
[03:49:16.850 --> 03:49:25.296]  And the lawsuits against me by the Democratic National Committee and an Obama-blessed front in D.C.
[03:49:25.596 --> 03:49:28.739]  have now cost me almost a half million dollars.
[03:49:29.299 --> 03:49:40.147]  Before this is all over, in my struggle against Mr. Mueller and his cohorts, my legal fees will greatly exceed one million dollars.
[03:49:40.800 --> 03:49:48.285]  Stories that you see online that say Roger Stone is worth 20 million bucks are completely and totally false.
[03:49:48.926 --> 03:49:50.687]  I am not a wealthy man.
[03:49:51.207 --> 03:49:54.429]  I work very hard to make a living for my family.
[03:49:54.810 --> 03:49:58.172]  Just because I dress well doesn't mean that I am rich.
[03:49:58.552 --> 03:50:08.159]  And therefore I must appeal to you to go to StoneDefenseFund.com StoneDefenseFund.com and make a generous contribution.
[03:50:08.739 --> 03:50:10.680]  I am in the fight of my life.
[03:50:11.260 --> 03:50:16.363]  I am in a fight for my future liberty, and I need your help.
[03:50:16.803 --> 03:50:19.104]  Now, let's go back to the phones.
[03:50:19.584 --> 03:50:22.546]  About Sonny in Florida, my home state.
[03:50:22.926 --> 03:50:24.667]  Sonny, what's on your mind?
[03:50:26.320 --> 03:50:27.361]  How are you, Sir Stone?
[03:50:27.401 --> 03:50:29.362]  It's a pleasure to speak with you yet again.
[03:50:29.402 --> 03:50:36.748]  I just let you know I just ordered up my Silver Bullet, Supermail, Secret 12, Anthroplex, Icarin, Red Pill Bodies.
[03:50:38.009 --> 03:50:42.713]  Miraculously, they were out of the chocolate caveman and I went with the strawberry.
[03:50:42.873 --> 03:50:44.694]  And surprisingly enough, I like it.
[03:50:44.794 --> 03:50:46.836]  And I'm going to donate to your defense fund.
[03:50:46.896 --> 03:50:49.618]  And I'm also going to buy your book once I get done with work here.
[03:50:51.319 --> 03:50:55.863]  My question to you is, I keep hearing about this
[03:50:57.057 --> 03:51:04.083]  Political backlash that may happen if President Donald J. Trump gets rid of maybe Mueller.
[03:51:04.843 --> 03:51:10.228]  Attorney Jeff Sessions, he could have gotten rid of a year ago and found somebody better.
[03:51:10.288 --> 03:51:11.769]  And also Rosenstein.
[03:51:12.169 --> 03:51:13.290]  What's your take on that?
[03:51:13.330 --> 03:51:16.913]  I mean, because we're in a political backlash now with them in office.
[03:51:18.174 --> 03:51:25.222]  Well, those who tell the president that he will be impeached if he removes those gentlemen have it exactly backwards.
[03:51:25.762 --> 03:51:29.146]  He'll be impeached if they do not remove those gentlemen.
[03:51:29.668 --> 03:51:33.031]  The president's political capital is at an all-time high.
[03:51:33.171 --> 03:51:33.551]  Why?
[03:51:33.651 --> 03:51:35.953]  Because we have a soaring economy.
[03:51:36.413 --> 03:51:40.116]  Because we are on the cusp of a historic peace deal in the Koreas.
[03:51:40.576 --> 03:51:44.759]  Because the president is leading and America is turning around.
[03:51:45.179 --> 03:51:48.622]  And you can see it exponentially in his approval rating.
[03:51:49.002 --> 03:51:50.382]  Which continues to climb.
[03:51:50.802 --> 03:51:59.645]  He has the authority and the political support to end this witch hunt today, and in my opinion, he should do so.
[03:52:00.185 --> 03:52:05.066]  The backlash will be against them, not against the President.
[03:52:05.346 --> 03:52:07.627]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:52:08.387 --> 03:52:12.368]  While we're on it, and we're in the state of Florida, let's go to Jackie in Florida.
[03:52:12.688 --> 03:52:15.889]  Jackie, what's on your mind for the Alex Jones Show?
[03:52:16.863 --> 03:52:17.143]  Yes.
[03:52:17.184 --> 03:52:18.145]  Hi, Roger.
[03:52:18.525 --> 03:52:19.847]  Great to be able to speak to you.
[03:52:20.348 --> 03:52:33.825]  I was wondering, did you make the correlation yesterday with the shootings that happened over in Annapolis, Maryland with what was breaking with Gowdy and the Rosenstein case?
[03:52:34.531 --> 03:52:40.533]  It seems like every time the Democrats are being exposed for something, something happens.
[03:52:41.033 --> 03:52:48.414]  Like when Hillary Clinton was being, when she was in court for her emails, there was a mass shooting somewhere.
[03:52:49.055 --> 03:52:58.697]  Something always seems to happen to distract Americans' attention from what is really being revealed and coming out about the Democrats.
[03:52:59.861 --> 03:53:00.862]  Like a massive shooting.
[03:53:00.882 --> 03:53:01.603]  Did you notice that?
[03:53:01.623 --> 03:53:06.027]  Because I remember listening to Alex before and Alex said, something's going to happen.
[03:53:06.288 --> 03:53:13.235]  And sure enough, during her email investigation, when she was being questioned, it was a mass shooting.
[03:53:13.935 --> 03:53:16.138]  Same thing when she was being questioned about Benghazi.
[03:53:16.158 --> 03:53:18.400]  And then yesterday, I just knew something was going to happen.
[03:53:18.460 --> 03:53:21.143]  And all of a sudden, there's a massive shooting at a newsroom.
[03:53:21.983 --> 03:53:38.264]  Did you make that correlation with every time there's something being exposed, the Democrats are being exposed, there seems to be something to distract America's attention away from what is actually happening in the news, the way they're being exposed with a mass shooting?
[03:53:39.403 --> 03:53:42.844]  Well, Jackie, I think you have a keen observation there.
[03:53:42.884 --> 03:53:45.665]  This is what we call the false flag syndrome.
[03:53:46.185 --> 03:54:06.111]  You notice as soon as the IG's report came out at the Justice Department pointing out the incredible corruption of the FBI under Barack Obama and their active role to subvert democracy in the 2016 election, we had this controversy about children being separated from their parents
[03:54:06.891 --> 03:54:19.855]  At the borders when their parents sought to enter the country illegally, which was going on under President Barack Obama, which was going on under President George W. Bush, but suddenly it was a news story.
[03:54:20.015 --> 03:54:20.355]  Why?
[03:54:20.655 --> 03:54:29.117]  Well, we needed to distract from the fact that the Obama Justice Department cover-up is collapsing around their ankles on Capitol Hill.
[03:54:29.617 --> 03:54:32.738]  So you make a very good observation.
[03:54:33.358 --> 03:54:41.645]  These events are in many cases being orchestrated to distract us from the exposure of the deep state.
[03:54:42.025 --> 03:54:43.746]  Thank you, Jackie, for your call.
[03:54:44.347 --> 03:54:56.336]  As one who has been targeted by the deep state, I cannot tell you how important it is to continue to have InfoWars as an outlet to expose the truth.
[03:54:56.997 --> 03:54:59.999]  When Alex Jones and I appeal for your help,
[03:55:00.649 --> 03:55:01.990]  We're not exaggerating.
[03:55:02.410 --> 03:55:04.451]  We are not giving you hype.
[03:55:05.071 --> 03:55:08.994]  InfoWars is under attack as never before.
[03:55:09.534 --> 03:55:19.199]  Alex Jones and InfoWars are facing multi-million dollar lawsuits, fueled by the radical left and in some cases George Soros.
[03:55:19.700 --> 03:55:21.961]  And they have a two-pronged approach.
[03:55:22.661 --> 03:55:38.149]  Use the negative headlines generated by their lawsuits as a rationale to take us off of YouTube, take us off of Facebook, take us off of Twitter, take us off social media entirely, and shut us down.
[03:55:38.670 --> 03:55:40.390]  There's no exaggeration here.
[03:55:40.871 --> 03:55:45.093]  Every one of these lawsuits against Alex Jones and InfoWars are frivolous.
[03:55:45.822 --> 03:55:46.603]  They're bogus.
[03:55:47.103 --> 03:55:48.084]  They're harassment.
[03:55:48.364 --> 03:55:51.366]  But that doesn't mean that they are inexpensive.
[03:55:51.866 --> 03:55:56.649]  They could, in the end, cost millions to keep InfoWars alive.
[03:55:57.150 --> 03:56:02.113]  And therefore, we ask you to go to the InfoWars site and find the donate button.
[03:56:02.805 --> 03:56:22.674]  You can give a generous contribution today if you're not in the market for one of our great nutraceutical products, or a book, or a t-shirt, but you want to help the fight for freedom, then go to the donate button at InfoWars, there you see it, and send us $25, or $50, or $100.
[03:56:22.774 --> 03:56:27.516]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have actually sent $1,000 or more.
[03:56:27.997 --> 03:56:30.898]  It will be the best investment you have ever made.
[03:56:31.378 --> 03:56:35.823]  Because we will continue to broadcast the truth here at InfoWars.
[03:56:36.344 --> 03:56:38.026]  We are not weak sisters.
[03:56:38.406 --> 03:56:40.729]  We are not sunshine patriots.
[03:56:41.089 --> 03:56:45.755]  We will fight for America to the bitter end and we will prevail.
[03:56:46.355 --> 03:56:47.896]  But not without your help.
[03:56:48.296 --> 03:57:07.604]  So whether you're helping me at thestonedefensefund.com, or you're helping InfoWars at the InfoWars site, or at the special legal defense fund set up for InfoWars, please know that God will bless you for your support, that we will thank you for your support, and that every dollar you give
[03:57:08.045 --> 03:57:16.905]  We'll be spent on the fight for freedom and our unfettered First Amendment rights to continue to bring you the frontline truth.
[03:57:17.874 --> 03:57:21.257]  I wish you a great weekend and ask you one more time.
[03:57:21.697 --> 03:57:23.958]  Go to the InfoWars.com site now.
[03:57:24.299 --> 03:57:29.682]  Look at our terrific specials, whether it's Supermail Vitality or Brain Force Plus.
[03:57:30.103 --> 03:57:31.584]  We need your support.
[03:57:32.004 --> 03:57:33.885]  Thank you and God bless you.
[03:57:34.285 --> 03:57:37.888]  And remember, Donald Trump turning America around.
[03:57:38.388 --> 03:57:40.889]  He is making America great again.
[03:57:41.289 --> 03:57:47.290]  The Mueller probe is nothing less than an attempt to undo the results of the last election.
[03:57:47.690 --> 03:57:49.191]  We are the resistance.
[03:57:49.471 --> 03:57:50.891]  Thank you and God bless you.
[03:57:56.353 --> 03:58:02.994]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:58:04.054 --> 03:58:06.115]  It's you that has defeated
[03:58:09.002 --> 03:58:09.402]  I don't know.
[03:58:28.234 --> 03:58:28.534]  I think?
[03:58:51.476 --> 03:58:51.897]  We're good.
