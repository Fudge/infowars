[00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:14.268]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.612]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:34.666]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:37.585]  We're live.
[00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:42.966]  It is February 20th, 2018, the Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:44.967]  I'll be in for Alex for the first two hours then.
[00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:51.348]  In the second two hours after that, the third and fourth hours, it will be the one and only Milo Yiannopoulos.
[00:00:51.368 --> 00:00:53.448]  But we've got a ton of news to cover right now.
[00:00:53.808 --> 00:01:01.130]  Top of the agenda being the increasing polarisation of America as the culture wars intensify.
[00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.230]  It's a fever pitch like never before.
[00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.731]  We have a top headline up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:09.370]  Which is also on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.733]  Kill the NRA sign appears on billboard in Louisville.
[00:01:14.294 --> 00:01:20.539]  Now we saw the Facebook account last week which of course this all brewed up after the school shooting in Florida.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:31.208]  The Facebook account where they actively encouraged and incited people to go out and shoot Republicans as revenge for the Florida high school shooting.
[00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:33.347]  Now it's gone into high gear.
[00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:37.230]  We've got this kill the NRA sign appearing on a billboard in Louisville.
[00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:46.178]  Again, in response to last week's shooting, the billboard, which appears on Interstate 65, was an act of vandalism, according to the company that owns the billboard.
[00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:48.519]  So it wasn't an actual ad buy.
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.481]  They're saying they're taking it down.
[00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.583]  There's no sign it's actually being taken down.
[00:01:52.923 --> 00:01:56.206]  The words resist 45 also appear on the sign.
[00:01:56.626 --> 00:02:01.390]  So this was obviously put up by radicalised, insane, hyper-partisan
[00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:17.347]  Anti-Trump resistance members and a spokeswoman for Outfront Media, the company that owns the billboard, said that it's being taken down but Wave 3 News got the exclusive on this and basically people are saying, once again, this is encouraging violence.
[00:02:17.947 --> 00:02:19.848]  Again, this is after the school shooting.
[00:02:19.888 --> 00:02:26.171]  They're actively calling on people to kill NRA members as a response to that shooting.
[00:02:26.997 --> 00:02:48.167]  After Facebook finally closed down this group, they removed the posts as we highlighted last week after our big story on it, which was also top of Drudge Report, they closed down the Facebook group of people openly inciting shooters, killers, crazed killers to copy James T. Hodgkinson, who of course was the shooter of Congressman Steve Scalise,
[00:02:48.863 --> 00:02:51.524]  They called on people to go out and get blood.
[00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:57.745]  Get a revenge blood attack against NRA members, against Republicans in response to the shooting.
[00:02:57.805 --> 00:02:59.225]  What is going on in America?
[00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:05.307]  How hyper-partisan has the political environment become where this kind of thing is happening?
[00:03:05.647 --> 00:03:06.987]  Kill the NRA signs.
[00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:09.067]  This has been up since Friday.
[00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:11.088]  It hasn't even been taken down yet.
[00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:11.688]  It's Tuesday.
[00:03:11.728 --> 00:03:13.088]  It's three, four days later.
[00:03:13.448 --> 00:03:14.269]  It's still up there.
[00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.849]  No sign of it being taken down.
[00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:22.900]  This is the political climate that we're dealing with, that people can be allowed to do this and there's basically going to be no backlash whatsoever.
[00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:25.342]  These are the times we're living in.
[00:03:25.362 --> 00:03:32.906]  This is an anti-Trump resistance message calling on people to kill NRA members in response for this school shooting.
[00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:34.607]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.429]  Meanwhile, we also have this story.
[00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:44.914]  In a similar vein, far-left writer calls on black people to start barking at white people who quote, speak out of turn.
[00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:46.738]  This is not The Onion.
[00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.780]  This is not a parody of far-left social justice warriors.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:59.646]  This is an actual call for black people, in the spirit of the movie Black Panther, in which this takes place, to bark at white people to make them shut up.
[00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:04.209]  How unhinged, how insane do you need to be to even entertain this?
[00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:10.313]  Now obviously the article is written tongue-in-cheek style, but it's a guy actually calling for this to happen.
[00:04:10.573 --> 00:04:11.634]  This is not a parody.
[00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.016]  He says, quote, we're too infected with colonisation and the myriad of residues and peripheral effects.
[00:04:18.056 --> 00:04:19.678]  He's talking about Wakanda.
[00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.140]  He's talking about Black Panther.
[00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:31.851]  He then goes on to actually encourage black people to silence white people, not just de-platform them, but silence them by barking at them.
[00:04:32.212 --> 00:04:33.113]  For example, if
[00:04:33.837 --> 00:04:39.161]  A woman's walking down an alleyway and she's passing, say, a gang of black people, she grabs her purse.
[00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:45.726]  This guy says that those black guys should just start literally barking at a woman in an alleyway.
[00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:47.288]  That's one of the examples he gives.
[00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:56.335]  If somebody's going in an elevator and they clutch their purse, they're also calling for people to bark at white people, to shut them up, to put them in their place.
[00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:59.137]  Absolutely incredible hyper-partisan times.
[00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:01.258]  This is the kind of insanity we're dealing with.
[00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:02.219]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.103]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[00:05:08.363 --> 00:05:13.887]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:19.271]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there.

[00:06:08.445 --> 00:06:16.449]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:20.851]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:25.314]  We are live, it is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:25.334 --> 00:06:29.356]  I was talking about this article which is up on Infowars.com as of a couple of hours ago.
[00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:35.679]  Headline, far-left writer calls on black people to start barking at white people who speak out of turn.
[00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:43.258]  Now this is in reference to the Black Panther movie, which is smashing all records, big hit at the box office obviously, more power to them.
[00:06:43.478 --> 00:06:50.602]  Kind of ironic given that it promotes literally an ethno-state with no immigration and zero refugees, but we'll get on to that in a second.
[00:06:51.402 --> 00:06:58.125]  This is a writer by the name of Damon Young at The Root, which is a massive far-left social justice warrior website.
[00:06:58.948 --> 00:07:04.352]  He's calling on black people to start barking at white people who, quote, speak out of turn.
[00:07:04.893 --> 00:07:09.596]  Now, let's read what he actually says in this article, because it has to be heard to be believed.
[00:07:10.557 --> 00:07:27.250]  He says, one thing that we can and definitely should start doing is what Mbakao and his Kay Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.
[00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.631]  That perennial woe.
[00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:29.835]  Bark!
[00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:31.917]  That's right, bark!
[00:07:31.937 --> 00:07:35.340]  He literally wants people to start barking at others to make them shut up.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.441]  He says, not a purposeless bark.
[00:07:37.702 --> 00:07:40.344]  This isn't a Shih Tzu barking through the window at a squirrel.
[00:07:40.704 --> 00:07:49.171]  Instead, this would be an intentional bark, a targeted bark, an overpowering bark, a drowning bark, a Wakandian bark, a bark meant to communicate
[00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:51.732]  Who told you that you can speak?
[00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:54.194]  When it's time for your words, we will let you know.
[00:07:54.214 --> 00:07:56.316]  And maybe that time will never come.
[00:07:56.356 --> 00:07:57.576]  That's right, shut up, bigot!
[00:07:57.897 --> 00:07:59.057]  How dare you have an opinion?
[00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:01.859]  How dare you speak because of your skin colour?
[00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:05.281]  We're literally going to bark at you because of your skin colour and tell you to shut up.
[00:08:05.862 --> 00:08:07.663]  But we're the anti-racists, okay?
[00:08:08.343 --> 00:08:09.544]  He continues, we'll see.
[00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:11.245]  Now just shut up and stand there.
[00:08:11.766 --> 00:08:14.908]  Maybe get on your phone and Google, how not to be a coloniser.
[00:08:15.552 --> 00:08:18.574]  Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.
[00:08:18.955 --> 00:08:24.679]  So he's literally in an article telling white people to shut up because of their skin colour.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.043]  And this is a website that postures itself as an anti-racist website, okay?
[00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:32.986]  Coming out with the most virulent, vile racism you can imagine.
[00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.488]  And yeah, of course, some of it's tongue-in-cheek.
[00:08:36.168 --> 00:08:37.169]  But he's serious.
[00:08:37.629 --> 00:08:38.710]  He's serious with this.
[00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.832]  He goes on to advocate, listen to this.
[00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:49.716]  Opening a school of Wakandan white silencing while providing several examples of when white people should be barked at.
[00:08:50.276 --> 00:08:59.600]  This is inexcusable behaviour on behalf of white people and this deserves being barked at like they're literally being de-platformed because of their skin colour, which is what he's advocating.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.661]  He says, a wayward white hand reaches for your hair.
[00:09:02.681 --> 00:09:04.302]  Woof woof woof!
[00:09:04.842 --> 00:09:11.205]  Now of course he's talking about this whole meme amongst the far left which is, oh white people always want to touch black people's hair.
[00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:16.932]  I mean, that happens with anyone who gets any kind of funky hairstyle, whether they're black or white.
[00:09:17.172 --> 00:09:19.273]  Oh, by the way, if you're white, you can't have dreadlocks either.
[00:09:19.313 --> 00:09:19.913]  That's racist.
[00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:21.493]  That's cultural appropriation.
[00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:26.714]  So he says, if a white person tries to touch a black person in any way, they should be barked at.
[00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:28.655]  He gives another example.
[00:09:29.015 --> 00:09:34.116]  A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refused to step aside when you attempt to walk past them.
[00:09:34.436 --> 00:09:35.297]  Woof, woof, woof!
[00:09:36.157 --> 00:09:38.277]  A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator.
[00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:39.277]  Woof, woof, woof!
[00:09:39.297 --> 00:09:41.378]  So if a young lady on her own
[00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.192]  Gets into an enclosed space with a group of guys.
[00:09:45.892 --> 00:09:47.053]  She should be balked at.
[00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:48.694]  She should be intimidated again.
[00:09:48.974 --> 00:09:50.455]  Because she's white.
[00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:52.716]  These are the anti-racists speaking, by the way.
[00:09:52.736 --> 00:09:58.800]  He continues, if they're going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:05.404]  So he's openly advocating scaring and intimidating women in enclosed spaces.
[00:10:06.164 --> 00:10:07.585]  Oh, but they're the anti-sexists.
[00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:08.646]  They're the anti-racists.
[00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:09.026]  Okay.
[00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:24.795]  So again, I continue in this article, despite its tongue-in-cheek nature, the article is yet another example of how identity politics obsessed progressives are using the Black Panther movie to stoke more racism and more division amongst Americans.
[00:10:25.676 --> 00:10:27.276]  Which of course has now kicked into high gear.
[00:10:27.296 --> 00:10:33.178]  We had the first black president, race relations worse than ever, and these people are exacerbating the problem.
[00:10:33.658 --> 00:10:36.399]  Those people on the far right are exacerbating the problem as well.
[00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:38.580]  They both need each other.
[00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:48.085]  That's why the media gives the alt-right and the far-right so much attention, because they need each other to continue fanning the flames of this hysteria, this division.
[00:10:49.385 --> 00:10:59.527]  The irony of this, of course, is pretty stunning, given that Wakanda, the fictional East African nation in which Black Panther is set, bears all the hallmarks of an alt-right utopia.
[00:10:59.887 --> 00:11:06.908]  There's actually a meme that I posted on Twitter where it shows all the characteristics, all the traits of Wakanda,
[00:11:07.737 --> 00:11:27.703]  This fictional East African country, Wakanda, is anti-immigration, isolationist, pro-wall, it's literally surrounded by walls to protect it, it has strict trade restrictions, it's anti-diversity, it's ethno-nationalist, it's anti-refugee, it's anti-democracy.
[00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:35.426]  In fact, they literally have a quote in the Black Panther movie which says, quote, refugees bring their problems with them.
[00:11:36.683 --> 00:11:40.564]  That's how they explain the fact that they're not going to allow any immigration.
[00:11:40.964 --> 00:11:46.365]  So by any score, Black Panther and Wakanda is an alt-right dream.
[00:11:46.585 --> 00:11:55.586]  If you want to really boil it down to its core characteristics, you know, the alt-right, the far-right, the racist, the racist Trump supporters should love this movie.
[00:11:56.007 --> 00:12:00.287]  Because it's basically everything they advocate, it takes it to the extreme.
[00:12:01.107 --> 00:12:03.748]  And yet this movie is being used again for division.
[00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:16.643]  In these hyper-partisan times, and now literally somebody at The Root is calling on black people to start barking at white people to intimidate them into silence, or simply to intimidate women on their own.
[00:12:17.563 --> 00:12:21.085]  And these people again, they're the anti-racists, we're the racists, okay.
[00:12:21.705 --> 00:12:25.847]  So Black Panther's doing extremely well at the box office as the culture wars intensify.
[00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:32.951]  Actually people who've watched the film have told me, I haven't had a chance to watch it, but people who've watched it and reviewed it have basically said that it's
[00:12:33.729 --> 00:12:46.143]  Basically a battle between hyper-ethno-nationalism, black supremacy, and the main character who at the end of the movie becomes more of a classical liberal and reason and logic tends to win the day.
[00:12:46.954 --> 00:12:54.497]  So, this movie is the complete opposite of what everyone thinks it is, with this whole liberation theology they've invested into.
[00:12:55.138 --> 00:13:04.162]  It's actually, from one perspective, it's an alt-right dream, and from another, the whole Black Lives Matter mantra gets demolished in the movie because they're the bad guys.
[00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:10.253]  So whatever people are transposing onto this Black Panther movie isn't really working out.
[00:13:10.293 --> 00:13:22.338]  There you see a screenshot that I did for my video with the main character with the Make America Great Again hat on, because again, a lot of aspects of Wakanda are stuff that literally Trump has advocated and is trying to implement.
[00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:25.100]  But no, that doesn't matter.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.360]  They're just using this film for division.
[00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:28.301]  Meanwhile,
[00:13:29.423 --> 00:13:35.106]  Another headline here, Hollywood elites blast Clint Eastwood's film for not portraying sympathetic terrorists.
[00:13:35.867 --> 00:13:38.609]  Now this is exactly what I predicted would happen.
[00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:46.854]  So Clint Eastwood made a movie, very interesting movie, it's definitely one I want to watch, about the Paris train attack.
[00:13:46.874 --> 00:13:52.257]  You remember that a couple of years ago, where the terrorists tried to carry out a massacre on a train heading to Paris.
[00:13:52.856 --> 00:13:56.877]  Those three US soldiers intervened, stopped a terrorist attack.
[00:13:57.237 --> 00:13:58.518]  One of them was black, by the way.
[00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.779]  He's literally a black hero because he plays himself in the movie as well.
[00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:12.902]  So you've got an actual black hero, not somebody prances around in a leotard on a stage like in Black Panther, but an actual African-American hero who stopped a terrorist
[00:14:13.522 --> 00:14:14.402]  Nobody knows about him.
[00:14:14.523 --> 00:14:15.463]  Nobody cares about him.
[00:14:15.903 --> 00:14:22.066]  But Clint Eastwood's movie, 1517 to Paris, they use the same guys who actually stopped the terrorists.
[00:14:22.106 --> 00:14:24.187]  The original guys are in the movie.
[00:14:25.247 --> 00:14:26.868]  Of course, Clint Eastwood's a conservative.
[00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:34.531]  Hollywood literally has to have secret societies of conservatives simply for them to be able to talk to each other and still have careers.
[00:14:34.932 --> 00:14:36.132]  They have to do it behind the scenes.
[00:14:36.172 --> 00:14:36.953]  It's all hush-hush.
[00:14:37.513 --> 00:14:42.315]  So now a wave of negative reviews is pouring in for Clint Eastwood's movie.
[00:14:43.112 --> 00:14:44.252]  And we're going to read some of them here.
[00:14:44.512 --> 00:15:05.218]  Slant Magazine talks about the film's departure from the surprisingly visceral and nuanced book and says that one misses the prismatic structure of 1517 to Paris and basically they go on to say that the terrorist in the movie who is stopped by the heroes is not portrayed sympathetically enough.
[00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:10.699]  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, even UK Daily Mail chastises this movie
[00:15:11.385 --> 00:15:11.505]  For
[00:15:29.802 --> 00:15:41.694]  At the Daily Mail, at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, at the Daily Beast, would the reviewers be complaining about the fact that the white supremacist terrorist wasn't portrayed sympathetically enough?
[00:15:42.296 --> 00:15:50.825]  Look at it that way, and yet that's exactly what they're doing with this Clint Eastwood movie while they fawn and worship at the feet of the Black Panther movie.
[00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:52.687]  Very interesting clash there.
[00:15:53.027 --> 00:15:58.733]  Very interesting case study for the intensified culture wars that we're now experiencing in America.
[00:15:58.773 --> 00:16:00.234]  We'll be back to talk about it after the break.
[00:16:00.274 --> 00:16:01.395]  Infowars.com.
[00:16:01.415 --> 00:16:01.896]  Don't go away.

[00:16:22.812 --> 00:16:28.154]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:28.274 --> 00:16:29.774]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:33.056]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:33.696 --> 00:16:34.676]  And so much more.
[00:16:35.216 --> 00:16:36.377]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:36.597 --> 00:16:38.317]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:38.337 --> 00:16:44.019]  The Mushroom Blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:44.139 --> 00:16:45.319]  A Citrus Peel Blend.

[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.740]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.241]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:53.201]  Beta, Glucan, Olive Leaf, and more.
[00:16:53.761 --> 00:16:54.362]  Immune Wall.

[00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.053]  Brett Smith, author of Thump!
[00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:07.534]  The First Bundred Days.
[00:17:08.255 --> 00:17:09.736]  Explain to people about Thump!
[00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:11.738]  and why this is an important book and how it ties into things.
[00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.261]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[00:17:14.441 --> 00:17:19.326]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the president, you know.
[00:17:19.646 --> 00:17:24.012]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[00:17:24.072 --> 00:17:29.939]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable, fluffy little bunny?
[00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:32.682]  It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[00:17:32.722 --> 00:17:33.844]  It's actually hilarious.
[00:17:33.904 --> 00:17:35.386]  I was cracking up reading the whole book.
[00:17:35.426 --> 00:17:36.367]  My wife was cracking up.
[00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:37.648]  And it's a great book for adults.
[00:17:37.668 --> 00:17:38.689]  It's a great book for children.
[00:17:38.729 --> 00:17:40.090]  We're selling the book.
[00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:46.256]  We've got it bundled as well here with a one-off poster that's a collector's item.
[00:17:46.457 --> 00:17:49.700]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the poster are $29.95.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.582]  That helps support us.

[00:19:04.648 --> 00:19:04.968]  Go ahead.
[00:19:05.419 --> 00:19:07.460]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:10.503]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:11.343 --> 00:19:12.424]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.485]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:15.206 --> 00:19:17.267]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:17.527 --> 00:19:21.510]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.032]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:24.832 --> 00:19:27.174]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:28.635]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:29.756]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:29.996 --> 00:19:31.037]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:31.457 --> 00:19:32.497]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:32.537 --> 00:19:33.618]  Put him on pause again.
[00:19:33.638 --> 00:19:34.458]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:40.099]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:40.399 --> 00:19:44.680]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.781]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:48.441]  You understand?
[00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:49.781]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:50.162 --> 00:19:51.282]  I need your help, Frank!

[00:21:02.446 --> 00:21:03.687]  So why not get it from us?
[00:21:04.147 --> 00:21:07.870]  We're going to have to take this sale down in a few days as we're almost sold out.
[00:21:08.691 --> 00:21:12.714]  And it will be at least a month before we can get this Super Blue back at its low price.
[00:21:12.734 --> 00:21:14.035]  So there's no time to wait.
[00:21:14.076 --> 00:21:15.236]  Make sure to get yours right now.
[00:21:15.297 --> 00:21:17.058]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:17.478 --> 00:21:20.461]  Massive 50% off discount.
[00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:22.142]  And that's not the only discount.
[00:21:22.162 --> 00:21:23.283]  We got the iCurin at 50% off.
[00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:24.004]  Cell Force at 53% off.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.541]  We're good to go.
[00:21:42.293 --> 00:21:45.755]  This is the anti-inflammatory support nutritional supplement.
[00:21:45.855 --> 00:21:46.635]  I've been taking this.
[00:21:46.835 --> 00:21:49.997]  I had a chest problem which was causing problems with breathing.
[00:21:50.037 --> 00:21:51.838]  It was basically an inflammation of the chest.
[00:21:51.898 --> 00:21:52.979]  It's a problem I've had before.
[00:21:52.999 --> 00:22:01.583]  I've been taking this product for about a week and a half now and it's really alleviated a lot of the symptoms with that anti-inflammatory support.
[00:22:01.623 --> 00:22:03.824]  It is bodies, whole body support.
[00:22:04.185 --> 00:22:06.846]  You can read the reviews at infowarstore.com.
[00:22:06.866 --> 00:22:09.667]  It's basically turmeric and we don't
[00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:11.922]  Broadcast.
[00:22:12.002 --> 00:22:17.245]  We don't cheerlead the benefits of turmeric in terms of alleviating mood as well.
[00:22:17.265 --> 00:22:22.149]  I mean, there are lots of scientific studies, double-blind studies, which show that it
[00:22:22.947 --> 00:22:27.429]  In some cases, it outperforms actual antidepressants in terms of lifting your mood.
[00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:29.230]  We're not selling it on that basis.
[00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:36.313]  We're selling it on the anti-inflammatory support, which I can personally testify has worked wonders for me in just the 10 days I've been taking it.
[00:22:36.873 --> 00:22:37.674]  It is bodies.
[00:22:37.734 --> 00:22:43.497]  It's available right now for £49.95, and that is a 120-capsule bottle.
[00:22:43.977 --> 00:22:47.098]  You take two a day, so that is going to last you for two months.
[00:22:47.598 --> 00:22:48.719]  If you have problems with
[00:22:49.474 --> 00:22:57.000]  Your joints, if you have problems with flexibility, if you've got inflammatory problems, BODYS could be the solution for you.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.784]  And look at those 4.9 independent reviews out of 18 reviews.
[00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:03.446]  So other people have got it.
[00:23:03.726 --> 00:23:06.908]  They're raving about it on Infowarsstore.com.
[00:23:07.008 --> 00:23:11.392]  It is BODYS and I can personally recommend that just in the 10 days that I've been taking it.
[00:23:12.173 --> 00:23:13.654]  I've noticed a definite improvement.
[00:23:14.295 --> 00:23:20.487]  You can also select a delivery every 60 days or every under an 80 days with the AutoShip option.
[00:23:20.968 --> 00:23:24.996]  You get a 10% discount on that on top of the discount we're already running.
[00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:30.585]  So if you forget to order it, obviously we take a lot of supplements, sometimes we forget to order them.
[00:23:30.985 --> 00:23:38.851]  The auto ship means you don't have to continually reorder, it does it for you and of course you can cancel at any time, you're not locked into any kind of contract.
[00:23:39.171 --> 00:23:44.555]  And you get a massive discount on top of the one already offered, and of course that's available on our other products as well.
[00:23:44.595 --> 00:23:49.158]  That is BODYS, whole body support, available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:23:49.978 --> 00:23:59.041]  Along with those other huge 50% discounts, 50% plus in some cases, including on the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:23:59.242 --> 00:24:05.144]  Support this network, it's more important than ever before, by getting the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:24:05.984 --> 00:24:09.745]  Now I was talking before the break about this new Clint Eastwood movie, the 1517 to Paris.
[00:24:12.094 --> 00:24:14.415]  Released at the same time as Black Panther.
[00:24:14.435 --> 00:24:17.136]  Now, I'm not saying that it's on the same level as Black Panther.
[00:24:17.176 --> 00:24:19.837]  Obviously, Black Panther's a huge Marvel blockbuster.
[00:24:19.857 --> 00:24:24.339]  It's got a giant budget, probably like 10, 15 times bigger than Clint Eastwood's.
[00:24:25.023 --> 00:24:34.312]  But this is a movie that interested me because the original story interested me and because the three main actors are the real heroes who stopped the actual terrorist.
[00:24:34.332 --> 00:24:40.257]  I mean, I'm not going to expect Oscar-level acting skills from them, but that's not why the movie is being denounced.
[00:24:40.737 --> 00:24:46.763]  It's being denounced because they don't treat the terrorist with enough kid gloves and enough sympathy.
[00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:55.377]  The Daily Beast, a reviewer at The Daily Beast, stated the film was, quote, more mind-numbing than his empty chair speech, and called it a stunning misfire.
[00:24:55.757 --> 00:25:10.369]  Of the terrorists, said The Daily Beast, as for the villain in question, Eastwood primarily films his hands, sneakers, arms and back, all as means of making him some sort of faceless existential threat, a symbolic vehicle for Stone's greater purpose.
[00:25:11.368 --> 00:25:20.078]  Now of course, why they did that is because they want all the attention, all the glory to go to the actual American heroes that stopped the terrorists.
[00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:23.101]  That's why they don't endlessly focus on the terrorist himself.
[00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:25.824]  But the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Review
[00:25:26.593 --> 00:25:30.254]  Lamented the exclusion of quote, any hint of the terrorist motivation.
[00:25:30.715 --> 00:25:36.777]  So again, they're more interested in the excuses as to why the terrorists carried out the attack.
[00:25:36.817 --> 00:25:40.799]  Maybe it was, you know, France's involvement in the war against ISIS or whatever.
[00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:43.520]  But again, that's not what the focus of the movie was about.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.381]  The focus of the movie is about the heroes.
[00:25:47.105 --> 00:25:53.875]  That literally triggered all these far left reviewers because we can't have American heroes being depicted as American heroes.
[00:25:54.396 --> 00:26:02.568]  There has to be some kind of divisive wedge issue or some kind of identity politics obsession inserted into every single movie.
[00:26:03.126 --> 00:26:13.129]  I mean, they're now saying the BAFTAs, which is the UK Film Awards, if they don't have a diversity message in the movie by 2019, it's not going to be even considered for an award.
[00:26:13.469 --> 00:26:24.373]  It's literal re-education brainwashing to the point where if these movies don't pass purity tests, if they don't fawn to left-wing dogmas, to left-wing obsession with identity politics,
[00:26:24.813 --> 00:26:26.414]  They're going to get bad reviews.
[00:26:26.875 --> 00:26:38.523]  I mean that is the ultimate kind of communist system where all the art has to be filtered, all the movies has to be filtered through this government censor before it can even be commented on in any kind of neutral way.
[00:26:38.804 --> 00:26:39.744]  I mean that is chilling.
[00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:45.929]  Even the Daily Mail wrote, which is a you know typically right-wing publication, wrote about this movie.
[00:26:46.747 --> 00:26:55.177]  The Clint Eastwood movie that is three heroes, quote, in that sacred American way, their Christianity is not incompatible with an obsession with firearms.
[00:26:56.139 --> 00:27:03.808]  Continued, the narrative throbs with Eastwood's conviction, shared as we know by President Trump, that the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
[00:27:04.548 --> 00:27:16.076]  So they can't tolerate for a second the message that in some cases terrorists, mass murderers, are stopped by responsible people with firearms.
[00:27:16.516 --> 00:27:25.402]  So on that basis alone, because it doesn't pass the purity test of these far-left publications, they gave it a negative review.
[00:27:26.183 --> 00:27:32.027]  So this is the whole situation right now where if you don't bow and scrape and grovel and genuflect
[00:27:32.577 --> 00:27:40.147]  To all these left-wing ideologues, these left-wing dogmas, you're not even going to get a fair hearing on any kind of art, on any kind of movie.
[00:27:40.447 --> 00:27:51.521]  And that's fundamentally bad for society, because it encourages people to make boring crap that's not driven by plot, but driven by, again, fawning obsequiousness to these left-wing dogmas.
[00:27:51.861 --> 00:27:56.565]  That's always going to produce boring, stale, samey, predictable content.
[00:27:56.945 --> 00:28:03.850]  And that's exactly what's starting to happen now in the rest of Hollywood, which is why their box office income has plummeted.
[00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.872]  We've seen the figures.
[00:28:05.892 --> 00:28:09.154]  They had the worst summer last year for about 10, 15 years.
[00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:22.122]  Even though there's more people going to the movies because the population is far greater than it was 15 years ago, but still income is down because people are turning away from this social justice indoctrination.
[00:28:22.582 --> 00:28:25.686]  We also see that with the NFL of course, people are turning away from that.
[00:28:26.086 --> 00:28:31.953]  The polls on the NFL said that people were turning off because they don't want politics in their sports.
[00:28:32.697 --> 00:28:43.882]  I mean, that's why when Vince McMahon launched the alternative to the NFL, the XFL, he made a point of saying we're not going to have politics constantly inserted, injected into everything.
[00:28:44.202 --> 00:28:54.246]  People are sick of it, but the left-wing intelligentsia is not sick of it, and that's why they're panning Clint Eastwood's movie, because he dares to portray authentic Americana.
[00:28:55.247 --> 00:28:58.068]  We will be back on the Alex Jones Show in the next segment.
[00:28:58.088 --> 00:28:59.669]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[00:28:59.689 --> 00:29:00.109]  Now go away.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.923]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[00:29:09.144 --> 00:29:13.847]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[00:29:14.448 --> 00:29:20.312]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[00:29:20.712 --> 00:29:33.302]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you have to absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[00:29:34.062 --> 00:29:42.748]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[00:29:42.768 --> 00:29:44.670]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.111]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[00:29:46.131 --> 00:29:47.432]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[00:29:47.612 --> 00:29:48.793]  He doesn't drink anything.
[00:29:48.933 --> 00:29:50.474]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[00:29:50.994 --> 00:29:52.595]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[00:29:52.615 --> 00:29:54.395]  I only have to take one knockout.
[00:29:54.755 --> 00:29:57.357]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[00:29:57.397 --> 00:29:58.257]  This is insane.
[00:29:58.677 --> 00:30:00.298]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[00:30:00.538 --> 00:30:03.099]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[00:30:03.539 --> 00:30:05.080]  He says, this is totally free.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.941]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[00:30:06.961 --> 00:30:08.801]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[00:30:09.682 --> 00:30:15.604]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[00:30:15.844 --> 00:30:17.185]  All just moderate dose.
[00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:26.700]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us a Mother Nature, is incredible.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.123]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.

[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.182]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[00:30:40.202 --> 00:30:44.965]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[00:30:45.445 --> 00:30:51.569]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.

[00:33:05.979 --> 00:33:12.243]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.050]  You found it!
[00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:23.891]  The tip of the spear!
[00:33:24.412 --> 00:33:26.853]  It is The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:27.414 --> 00:33:31.357]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson!
[00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:36.591]  We're live, it is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.651 --> 00:33:40.975]  Milo Yiannopoulos is coming up in the third and fourth hours, so be sure to stay tuned for that.
[00:33:41.914 --> 00:33:46.798]  Well, let's recap what we started the show with, which is this top story, which is also on the Drudge Report.
[00:33:46.878 --> 00:33:51.842]  It is, Kill the NRA sign appears on billboard in Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:33:52.383 --> 00:33:55.825]  This sign has been up since Friday, at least since Friday.
[00:33:56.146 --> 00:34:00.569]  It was still up as of yesterday evening, or Monday evening, I believe.
[00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:01.970]  That's right, yesterday evening.
[00:34:02.431 --> 00:34:03.231]  Kill the NRA.
[00:34:03.812 --> 00:34:08.876]  Resist 45, obviously a reference to the resistance movement against President Trump.
[00:34:09.918 --> 00:34:16.221]  This is a sign of the divisive, violent rhetoric that is plaguing the political discourse right now.
[00:34:16.501 --> 00:34:21.243]  This follows just days after our big exclusive story about the Facebook group.
[00:34:21.883 --> 00:34:29.266]  I think the name of the group was Milkshakes for the Republican Party, which was, by the way, removed by Facebook days later.
[00:34:29.346 --> 00:34:31.987]  They were slow off the starting gun again on that.
[00:34:32.647 --> 00:34:35.388]  But on that Facebook page, we featured the quotes.
[00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:36.609]  Absolutely shocking.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.503]  This is the quote from the Facebook page on this far-left group after the Florida shooting.
[00:34:42.404 --> 00:34:46.907]  It said, quote, Dear crazed shooters, the GOP has frequent baseball practice.
[00:34:47.408 --> 00:34:48.749]  You really want to be remembered.
[00:34:49.049 --> 00:34:49.909]  That's how you do it.
[00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:56.875]  Signed, Americans tired of our politicians bathing in the blood of the innocent for a few million dollars from the terrorist organization NRA.
[00:34:57.515 --> 00:35:03.520]  That was literally put out as a public post on Facebook, calling the NRA a terrorist group, decrying
[00:35:04.716 --> 00:35:11.222]  Politicians bathing in the blood of the innocent while calling for terrorist attacks and bloody shootings.
[00:35:11.822 --> 00:35:13.603]  Do they not get the irony there?
[00:35:14.024 --> 00:35:20.269]  There was another post on this Facebook page which read, quote, you remember the shooting at the Republican baseball game?
[00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:26.594]  Of course, a reference to the James T. Hodgkinson attempted massacre, which thankfully claimed no lives.
[00:35:26.654 --> 00:35:29.217]  Obviously, severely injured Congressman Scalise.
[00:35:29.677 --> 00:35:30.798]  The post went on to say,
[00:35:31.844 --> 00:35:39.612]  One of those should happen every week until those NRA-funded SOBs do something about this.
[00:35:40.052 --> 00:35:47.039]  So they're openly calling for politically motivated terrorist attacks in response to this horrific shooting.
[00:35:47.734 --> 00:35:52.977]  Now, of course, we've got CNN, we've got MSNBC using these kids as propaganda tools.
[00:35:53.017 --> 00:36:00.681]  Again, their favourite tactic is to use children as cheerleaders, as dog whistles for their anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment message.
[00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:10.486]  Oh, by the way, one of the kids involved in this school shooting, one of the survivors, is a fan of Import Wars, follows me on Twitter, is pro-Second Amendment.
[00:36:10.907 --> 00:36:13.008]  You don't see him on CNN, do you?
[00:36:13.548 --> 00:36:13.728]  No.
[00:36:14.068 --> 00:36:17.529]  They've only picked the students who are anti-gun.
[00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:24.672]  Of course, in Florida, you're going to get a lot of people who were growing up in conservative families who understand and cherish the Second Amendment.
[00:36:24.932 --> 00:36:27.893]  Those kids, those survivors, aren't on CNN.
[00:36:28.433 --> 00:36:30.573]  Instead, we've got this headline out of CNN.
[00:36:31.134 --> 00:36:35.275]  Parkland students show why 16-year-olds should be able to vote.
[00:36:35.835 --> 00:36:37.616]  They're literally calling for 16 years.
[00:36:37.636 --> 00:36:45.218]  I mean, when I was 16, I literally thought communism was fantastic, that capitalism was to blame for all the ills in the world.
[00:36:45.658 --> 00:36:46.398]  I was stupid.
[00:36:46.679 --> 00:36:47.339]  I was naive.
[00:36:48.359 --> 00:36:51.220]  Who knows anything about anything when they're 16 years old?
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:37:00.403]  Now you've got some of these kids who are being put up on television, some of these videos that we've embedded in this article, up on Infowars.com there's an article about this.
[00:37:01.164 --> 00:37:02.584]  Well, they're practicing lines.
[00:37:02.624 --> 00:37:05.145]  They're being told by people off-camera what to say.
[00:37:05.185 --> 00:37:06.826]  In one case, that's what it looks like.
[00:37:07.166 --> 00:37:18.069]  Now, that's not to take away from the absolute horror of the experience that these kids went through, but they are being used to push a political message in the aftermath of this.
[00:37:18.549 --> 00:37:24.631]  Now, CNN is calling on basically the law to be changed and 16-year-olds being given the right to vote.
[00:37:25.391 --> 00:37:27.272]  It says the real adults in the room
[00:37:27.967 --> 00:37:29.628]  Oh, the youth from Parkland, Florida.
[00:37:29.828 --> 00:37:33.030]  Again, excluding the youth who actually support the Second Amendment.
[00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.091]  Nobody wants to speak to them.
[00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:35.412]  Nobody wants them on camera, do they?
[00:37:35.432 --> 00:37:36.893]  Because that wouldn't jive, would it?
[00:37:37.433 --> 00:37:38.534]  That wouldn't fit their message.
[00:37:39.554 --> 00:37:43.657]  Continues, who are speaking out about the need for meaningful gun control laws.
[00:37:43.997 --> 00:37:46.899]  They are proving that civic engagement among young people can make a difference.
[00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:49.401]  The ironic part, they can't even vote yet.
[00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:56.145]  Goes on to say several municipalities in the United States allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote in local elections.
[00:37:56.934 --> 00:38:06.778]  So there's a good tweet in response to this which said basically, if your ideas are dependent on needing 16-year-olds to vote for them, maybe they aren't good ideas.
[00:38:08.218 --> 00:38:16.061]  What in the heck does any 16-year-old know about anything, much less these complex, nuanced political debates?
[00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:23.164]  That's not to say that we shouldn't encourage young people to get involved in the political process, but to give 16-year-olds the vote, I mean, come on.
[00:38:23.604 --> 00:38:24.364]  What's next?
[00:38:24.384 --> 00:38:24.705]  12-year-olds?
[00:38:24.745 --> 00:38:25.465]  Maybe 10-year-olds?
[00:38:26.105 --> 00:38:40.705]  Isn't it a coincidence that they want to give people a vote because they're the most easily swayed by propaganda because at such a young age you tend to take the most simplistic explanation of anything and then that becomes your own political dogma?
[00:38:41.371 --> 00:38:51.177]  You grow up, you become an actual adult and realize that things are just a little bit more complicated than that, which is why we tend to have the voting age a little bit older.
[00:38:51.418 --> 00:39:07.628]  But now CNN is calling on 16 and 17 year olds to be able to vote in elections, just by coincidence, because they're probably going to vote in slightly larger numbers for all the policies that CNN would support, including, of course, restricted gun control measures.
[00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:10.670]  Now, as another example of this,
[00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.632]  The divisive rhetoric that we're seeing.
[00:39:13.792 --> 00:39:14.913]  This is on my Twitter.
[00:39:15.594 --> 00:39:18.096]  If you go on there and scroll down a little bit, this will pop up.
[00:39:18.136 --> 00:39:22.820]  It's a tweet by somebody called Wakanda Flockaflame, a reference again to the Black Panther movie.
[00:39:23.241 --> 00:39:25.383]  This guy is literally wearing
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.722]  A communist hammer and sickle t-shirt.
[00:39:28.782 --> 00:39:38.090]  Here we have an irony of a guy wearing a t-shirt that symbolizes mass murder and he's lecturing everyone else about mass murder.
[00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.551]  The tweet says this.
[00:39:40.052 --> 00:39:46.457]  This is not just some random... This got tweeted, retweeted, 12.3 thousand times.
[00:39:46.877 --> 00:39:51.321]  It got 41,000 likes on Twitter in the past two days.
[00:39:51.361 --> 00:39:53.443]  You see it up on screen now for TV viewers.
[00:39:54.105 --> 00:40:02.133]  It says, I've been to public high school and black and Latin kids brought guns and knives to school every day.
[00:40:02.153 --> 00:40:03.475]  Oh, great.
[00:40:04.196 --> 00:40:06.118]  And no one ever got shot or stabbed.
[00:40:07.852 --> 00:40:12.453]  Yeah, because there's literally no shootings or stabbings by black kids or Latino kids.
[00:40:12.713 --> 00:40:14.294]  That never happens in America.
[00:40:14.794 --> 00:40:17.814]  They don't form a significant part of violent crime statistics.
[00:40:17.854 --> 00:40:18.615]  That's not happening.
[00:40:19.195 --> 00:40:22.956]  And this guy went to school with kids who brought guns and knives in every day.
[00:40:22.976 --> 00:40:25.656]  And they were well-behaved children.
[00:40:26.336 --> 00:40:27.717]  Nothing ever went wrong.
[00:40:28.557 --> 00:40:30.938]  He finishes by saying, kids aren't the problem.
[00:40:31.238 --> 00:40:32.658]  White kids are.
[00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:40.595]  So again, every single event they seize on it to push this divisive identity politics, this obsession with racism.
[00:40:41.496 --> 00:40:48.360]  Now Slate, of all publications, Slate, which is a left-wing publication, did a study into mass shooters.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:56.985]  They found that the demographics on ethnicity of mass shooters correlate almost exactly with the demographics of the American population.
[00:40:57.566 --> 00:41:00.509]  So the amount of white shooters correlates almost directly.
[00:41:00.549 --> 00:41:10.457]  In fact, white people are slightly underrepresented in mass shootings per head as part of the population, the general population, because you've got some Hispanic shooters, some black shooters.
[00:41:10.857 --> 00:41:13.779]  It tends to correlate with population demographics.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:19.124]  So this entire narrative that the only people who carry out mass shootings are white kids.
[00:41:19.524 --> 00:41:24.448]  Yes, the majority are white kids because white people are the majority in the United States.
[00:41:24.969 --> 00:41:26.410]  Slate proved it.
[00:41:27.256 --> 00:41:29.317]  This is not Newsmax.
[00:41:29.337 --> 00:41:30.518]  This is not World Net Daily.
[00:41:30.558 --> 00:41:31.759]  This is not Breitbart.
[00:41:31.819 --> 00:41:32.839]  This is not Infowars.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.720]  This is a left-wing publication.
[00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:37.782]  They proved that demographics correlated with mass shootings.
[00:41:37.822 --> 00:41:39.403]  So again, completely wrong.
[00:41:40.184 --> 00:41:41.184]  Completely insane.
[00:41:41.244 --> 00:41:43.626]  Completely unhinged to say the problem is white kids.
[00:41:44.506 --> 00:41:49.029]  Even more unhinged to say, oh, my friends brought in knives and guns to school every day.
[00:41:49.049 --> 00:41:49.489]  They were black.
[00:41:49.509 --> 00:41:50.110]  They were Latino.
[00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:51.150]  We didn't have any problems.
[00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:52.951]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:54.072]  But this is the rhetoric.
[00:41:54.594 --> 00:41:57.675]  We're seeing in the aftermath of the Parkland massacre.
[00:41:57.695 --> 00:42:10.981]  We're also seeing Jim Carrey in another bizarre tweet that he came out with, headline sick, Jim Carrey tweets to teen survivor graphic cartoon of school massacre with anti-Trump message.
[00:42:11.021 --> 00:42:12.482]  This is a Gateway Pundit article.
[00:42:13.121 --> 00:42:24.793]  Actor-comedian Jim Carrey created an anti-Trump work of art showing bloody dead bodies of dead students killed in the Parkland Florida school massacre and tweeted it to a teen student survivor of the attack.
[00:42:26.054 --> 00:42:30.539]  Now this cartoon basically shows Trump on the golf course pitching golf balls
[00:42:31.923 --> 00:42:36.784]  On a silhouette, in a silhouette before a fairway littered with bloody bodies of children.
[00:42:37.265 --> 00:42:40.346]  Trump is shown yelling, what's wrong with these kids?
[00:42:40.746 --> 00:42:43.166]  Didn't they hear me yell for?
[00:42:43.706 --> 00:42:49.268]  So he's literally blaming directly Donald Trump for the Florida school massacre.
[00:42:49.648 --> 00:42:52.149]  By the way, a number of mass shootings during Obama's term
[00:42:53.516 --> 00:42:57.320]  41.
[00:42:54.417 --> 00:42:57.320]  Number of shootings blamed on Obama, zero.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.823]  But Trump's at fault for the Florida massacre.
[00:42:59.863 --> 00:43:01.025]  We'll be back to talk more about it.
[00:43:01.065 --> 00:43:02.066]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:43:02.466 --> 00:43:04.469]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.869]  Go ahead.
[00:43:05.169 --> 00:43:07.352]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:43:07.372 --> 00:43:10.436]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:43:11.238 --> 00:43:12.339]  It just gets old, man.
[00:43:12.659 --> 00:43:14.381]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:43:15.082 --> 00:43:17.164]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:43:17.404 --> 00:43:21.408]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:43:21.428 --> 00:43:23.910]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:43:24.731 --> 00:43:27.053]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:43:27.413 --> 00:43:28.514]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:43:28.775 --> 00:43:29.656]  Us being shut down?
[00:43:29.896 --> 00:43:30.917]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:43:31.357 --> 00:43:32.398]  You know what, Alex?
[00:43:32.438 --> 00:43:33.498]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:43:33.518 --> 00:43:34.339]  Hey, Frank!
[00:43:34.639 --> 00:43:39.982]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:43:40.302 --> 00:43:44.584]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:43:44.804 --> 00:43:47.686]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:43:47.946 --> 00:43:48.326]  You understand?
[00:43:48.406 --> 00:43:49.687]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:43:50.047 --> 00:43:51.168]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:43:52.168 --> 00:43:57.092]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[00:44:07.059 --> 00:44:08.079]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:11.760]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.381]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:14.221]  They're suing me.
[00:44:14.461 --> 00:44:15.662]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[00:44:16.142 --> 00:44:17.922]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[00:44:17.962 --> 00:44:19.323]  We were bringing five million in a year.
[00:44:19.583 --> 00:44:20.583]  It cost a lot to run this.
[00:44:20.743 --> 00:44:22.624]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[00:44:22.864 --> 00:44:27.605]  I keep growing more as fast as I can, and as fast as I cut them off, I'm shooting out tentacles.
[00:44:27.905 --> 00:44:29.446]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:30.046]  Tell him right there.
[00:44:30.066 --> 00:44:30.306]  Frank!
[00:44:30.606 --> 00:44:31.166]  Hey, Frank!
[00:44:31.426 --> 00:44:32.667]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:38.668]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention, although of course everybody likes a little bit of attention, it's nice.
[00:44:38.868 --> 00:44:49.171]  But I can't do TV and I can't do radio and I can't publish books and I can't sell anything and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... We're the heretics!
[00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:52.052]  Yeah, exactly, using every resource at their disposal.
[00:44:52.092 --> 00:44:55.953]  So it's not bragging, it's a daily reality and that's why you've got to support things like InfoWars and
[00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:58.776]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[00:44:58.796 --> 00:44:59.296]  We're doing it now.
[00:44:59.396 --> 00:45:00.518]  Infowarsstore.com.

[00:45:18.578 --> 00:45:19.218]  We're fighting!
[00:45:19.478 --> 00:45:20.819]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[00:45:20.879 --> 00:45:25.140]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass, but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.

[00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:07.773]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:46:08.073 --> 00:46:12.536]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:46:12.856 --> 00:46:21.201]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:46:21.541 --> 00:46:24.783]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[00:46:25.043 --> 00:46:29.964]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:46:30.284 --> 00:46:37.246]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:46:37.587 --> 00:46:41.187]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:46:41.488 --> 00:46:45.829]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:46:46.229 --> 00:46:49.790]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:51.731]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.030]  We're live!
[00:47:27.071 --> 00:47:29.252]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:29.272 --> 00:47:35.178]  Before I get back into the news, let's talk about some of the great deals available right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:47:35.198 --> 00:47:37.780]  We talked about limited time sales ending soon.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:44.666]  That is 50% off a bunch of different products, notably Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:47:44.726 --> 00:47:48.229]  Again, this sale is going to be taken down in a few days because we're running out.
[00:47:48.289 --> 00:47:50.972]  It's not going to be available at that price again for a while.
[00:47:51.698 --> 00:47:54.439]  It is the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:47:54.479 --> 00:47:56.340]  You should be buying this product anyway.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.182]  How many years have we been talking about the dangers of sodium fluoride?
[00:48:00.782 --> 00:48:03.904]  You can get it from us at this great discount price.
[00:48:03.964 --> 00:48:04.904]  Look at those reviews.
[00:48:04.924 --> 00:48:14.749]  4.8 out of 3,384 independent reviews on infowarsstore.com for the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:48:15.427 --> 00:48:21.009]  Again, you can select the AutoShip option to get an even bigger discount, have it delivered every six hours.
[00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:24.150]  How annoying is it when you run out of toothpaste, when you don't have toothpaste?

[00:48:52.428 --> 00:49:03.416]  The more toxins and diseases find their way into your system, the more important it is that your body's detox systems can keep up, because your liver and kidneys are without a doubt the most important detoxifiers.
[00:49:03.696 --> 00:49:09.160]  It's time you took care of them like they take care of you with Icurin from InfoWars Life.
[00:49:09.895 --> 00:49:12.277]  Again, that is available right now at 50% off.

[00:49:42.949 --> 00:49:49.771]  Now CNN, MSNBC and the usual suspects are trying to turn this Florida school shooting
[00:49:50.732 --> 00:49:53.637]  Into basically a baseball bat to beat Trump over the head with.
[00:49:53.677 --> 00:49:57.022]  We had the massive scandal over the weekend if you remember.
[00:49:57.362 --> 00:50:01.508]  Trump visiting some of the victims in hospital and you know what he did?
[00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:04.192]  You know what that evil son of a gun did?
[00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:06.376]  He actually smiled on camera.
[00:50:06.952 --> 00:50:18.241]  Now let's not talk about the fact that in these pictures the rest of the family and the victim, the girl who's in the hospital bed recovering, they've also got beaming smiles from ear to ear.
[00:50:18.521 --> 00:50:18.722]  No.
[00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:26.047]  Trump's bad because he's doing exactly the same thing in the photograph as the victim and as the family members of the victim are doing.
[00:50:26.308 --> 00:50:27.789]  They tried to pin that on him as well.
[00:50:29.036 --> 00:50:32.499]  Literally, the derangement has reached levels unparalleled.
[00:50:32.819 --> 00:50:42.486]  You've got them worshipping North Korean dictators, people involved in that brutal, horrific regime, worshipping them for smiling at the Winter Olympics.
[00:50:42.646 --> 00:50:43.126]  They're great.
[00:50:43.526 --> 00:50:48.750]  They literally have hundreds of thousands of political dissidents in incarceration camps who get tortured to death.
[00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:54.334]  But she's great because she smiled and she gave Mike Pence the side eye and she really owned him.
[00:50:56.132 --> 00:50:57.213]  The media's worshipping her.
[00:50:57.333 --> 00:51:04.299]  Meanwhile, Trump smiles in a hospital photo with the rest of the family members and the victim smiling, but he's bad.
[00:51:04.839 --> 00:51:06.701]  Absolutely incredible double standard.
[00:51:06.721 --> 00:51:07.982]  There you see some of the pictures.
[00:51:08.462 --> 00:51:14.547]  The staff members are all smiling, trying to raise everyone's spirits in what must be a horrible, horrible time.
[00:51:14.807 --> 00:51:16.729]  But no, Trump's bad for doing that.
[00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:23.014]  Then you have the obvious political narrative going against Trump, blaming him for the massacre.
[00:51:23.971 --> 00:51:26.213]  Now we have this article from Daily Caller.
[00:51:26.994 --> 00:51:31.198]  Hero coach who laid down his life protecting students was a Trump supporter.
[00:51:31.698 --> 00:51:37.704]  One of the heroes who lost his life during the Florida school shooting this week appears to have been a Trump supporter.
[00:51:38.444 --> 00:51:47.813]  These are the Facebook likes of the late football coach Aaron Feist who died using his body as a human shield to protect students from flying bullets at Stoneman Douglas High School.
[00:51:48.393 --> 00:51:50.235]  So they went through his Facebook likes
[00:51:51.189 --> 00:51:52.170]  It was all Donald Trump.
[00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.770]  It was anti-socialist stuff.
[00:51:54.871 --> 00:51:56.832]  It was spicy memes against socialism.
[00:51:56.872 --> 00:51:57.853]  All kinds of good stuff.
[00:51:58.673 --> 00:51:59.934]  Again, they circled his likes.
[00:51:59.974 --> 00:52:02.675]  He likes Ben Shapiro, a bunch of different conservative websites.
[00:52:02.695 --> 00:52:04.976]  He likes Donald J. Trump.
[00:52:05.917 --> 00:52:09.279]  So this effort to pin this on Trump is completely asinine.
[00:52:09.319 --> 00:52:17.163]  As I said in the previous segment, one of the survivors, one of the victims of this attack, who took some of the iconic photographs
[00:52:17.759 --> 00:52:21.344]  Of them hiding under the desks, hiding under the tables, hiding under the chairs.
[00:52:21.765 --> 00:52:23.107]  He's an InfoWars fan!
[00:52:23.187 --> 00:52:24.469]  Huge InfoWars fan!
[00:52:25.009 --> 00:52:26.712]  I was talking to him on Twitter.
[00:52:27.722 --> 00:52:31.004]  So some of the victims were Trump supporters, some of them were Trump haters.
[00:52:31.424 --> 00:52:32.104]  Doesn't matter.
[00:52:32.564 --> 00:52:40.428]  Why are you trying to politicise this by blaming Trump when literally the hero who threw himself in front of the victims was a Trump supporter?
[00:52:40.888 --> 00:52:53.014]  Now, if this massacre was motivated by somebody's support for Trump, which doesn't appear to be the case, it appears to have been motivated by the fact that this guy was a nihilistic loser, then yeah, that may have been part of the discussion, but it wasn't.
[00:52:53.789 --> 00:53:06.159]  I mean, there was an attempted terrorist attack before Christmas, which we reported on, where it was a Muslim convert who was planning to shoot up Pier 39 in San Francisco and murder a bunch of people.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.921]  He was a supporter of Antifa.
[00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:10.002]  He was a Muslim convert.
[00:53:10.082 --> 00:53:12.144]  It was obviously a politically motivated attack.
[00:53:12.484 --> 00:53:13.605]  Thankfully, it was stopped.
[00:53:14.105 --> 00:53:21.071]  But again, if it's politically motivated, then yes, it's right to talk about it and to talk about the environment that we're in right now.
[00:53:21.747 --> 00:53:33.232]  But these school shootings, obviously the vast majority of them, are just carried out by nihilistic loner losers who've had terrible parenting, terrible backgrounds, and that's what we need to address in society.
[00:53:33.472 --> 00:53:35.973]  The atomisation of these young people.
[00:53:37.013 --> 00:53:42.536]  You can't just pin it on Donald Trump because you've got Trump derangement syndrome like Jim Carrey.
[00:53:42.556 --> 00:53:45.497]  I mean, let's flash back to that Gateway Pundit headline.
[00:53:46.087 --> 00:53:51.609]  Jim Carrey tweets to teen survivor graphic cartoon of school massacre with anti-Trump message.
[00:53:52.009 --> 00:53:56.590]  So he's literally scrawled this cartoon in his fever.
[00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:04.732]  And it shows Trump pitching a golf ball with the golf green littered with dead bodies of children.
[00:54:06.713 --> 00:54:07.833]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:54:07.853 --> 00:54:09.974]  He added the quote, what's wrong with these kids?
[00:54:10.034 --> 00:54:12.195]  Didn't they hear me yell four.
[00:54:13.215 --> 00:54:13.435]  Again,
[00:54:14.048 --> 00:54:19.170]  There were 41 mass shootings during Barack Obama's presidential term.
[00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.531]  How many was he blamed for?
[00:54:21.931 --> 00:54:24.973]  By people like Jim Carrey, by people on the left.
[00:54:25.393 --> 00:54:25.893]  Zero.
[00:54:27.374 --> 00:54:37.698]  The first major mass shooting after, of course, the Las Vegas massacre, which they also tried to blame on Trump, by the way, even though most of the victims would have been Trump supporters, typically at a country music rock concert,
[00:54:38.886 --> 00:54:42.288]  Again, immediately, their Trump derangement syndrome takes hold.
[00:54:42.489 --> 00:54:49.553]  Literally everything, every mass casualty event, everything they have to pin on him because they need to tie it into their derangement.
[00:54:49.593 --> 00:54:53.356]  Meanwhile, some of the victims, some of the survivors, were Trump supporters.
[00:54:53.376 --> 00:54:56.278]  So you're disrespecting those people when you do that.
[00:54:57.318 --> 00:55:03.743]  But again, this is the divisive environment that we live in and it's reached levels of hysteria that we haven't seen.
[00:55:04.463 --> 00:55:08.466]  I've certainly never seen in my entire history of covering news, basically.
[00:55:09.232 --> 00:55:20.274]  Well, we got to the point where four left-righters at The Root are calling on black people to start barking up white people and intimidating women in elevators.
[00:55:21.254 --> 00:55:21.995]  For what reason?
[00:55:22.655 --> 00:55:23.875]  For what reason, do I ask?
[00:55:23.915 --> 00:55:27.376]  We're supposed to be coming together as a society in these difficult times.
[00:55:27.716 --> 00:55:31.937]  These people constantly driving wedges over and over again.
[00:55:31.957 --> 00:55:33.477]  And the far right
[00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.531]  Appreciates that too.
[00:55:35.591 --> 00:55:36.532]  They need each other.
[00:55:36.552 --> 00:55:38.513]  They riff off of each other.
[00:55:38.553 --> 00:55:43.875]  So the hysteria on the fringes continues to build because it benefits both sides.
[00:55:44.555 --> 00:55:45.535]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:55:47.296 --> 00:55:48.697]  Switching gears for a moment though.
[00:55:49.057 --> 00:55:52.478]  This is out of the Washington Post and Donald Trump tweeted about this this morning.
[00:55:53.319 --> 00:55:57.380]  Trump accuser keeps telling her story hoping someone will finally listen.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.061]  This is the same woman
[00:55:59.645 --> 00:56:04.350]  Who has accused Donald Trump of sexually harassing her over and over again.
[00:56:05.171 --> 00:56:06.392]  People are listening.
[00:56:06.553 --> 00:56:09.075]  She's been on countless television shows.
[00:56:09.456 --> 00:56:13.240]  She's got the front page headline in the Washington Post.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.082]  Trump completely denies it.
[00:56:16.286 --> 00:56:27.570]  He tweeted this morning, a woman I don't know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the front page of the fake news Washington Post saying I kissed her for two minutes in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago.
[00:56:27.991 --> 00:56:28.591]  Never happened.
[00:56:28.871 --> 00:56:31.712]  Who would do this in a public space with live security?
[00:56:32.495 --> 00:56:33.576]  Camera's running.
[00:56:33.716 --> 00:56:35.757]  So Trump's calling it another false accusation.
[00:56:36.257 --> 00:56:40.179]  The Washington Post is running with a headline that nobody's listening to this woman.
[00:56:40.399 --> 00:56:45.502]  She's literally, she was on Megyn Kelly's show for like half an hour in December talking about this.
[00:56:45.862 --> 00:56:47.162]  She's been in the Washington Post.
[00:56:47.182 --> 00:56:48.703]  She's been in numerous other publications.
[00:56:49.103 --> 00:56:49.924]  People are listening.
[00:56:49.944 --> 00:56:51.485]  It just seems like they're not believing.
[00:56:52.285 --> 00:56:53.366]  And that's the problem we have here.
[00:56:53.406 --> 00:57:01.970]  Remember, this woman who claims that Trump kissed her, that he accosted her at Trump Tower, went on Megyn Kelly's show
[00:57:02.674 --> 00:57:08.096]  And said, characterise Trump asking for her phone number as sexual harassment.
[00:57:08.116 --> 00:57:08.677]  Remember that?
[00:57:09.817 --> 00:57:18.721]  So again, you've got this whole Me Too movement, which has been again, completely politicised, completely hijacked by people on the far left, to demean Donald Trump.
[00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:22.303]  Once again, tying every single thing into their Trump derangement syndrome.
[00:57:23.063 --> 00:57:24.624]  Whether Trump should address this?
[00:57:26.044 --> 00:57:26.464]  Who knows?
[00:57:26.504 --> 00:57:29.886]  Maybe that's a mistake, but people aren't going to tell him what to tweet, as we've found out by now.
[00:57:30.515 --> 00:57:38.080]  But this is a woman who's got relentless, saturation media coverage, and yet she's on the front page of the Washington Post saying, no one's listening.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:46.845]  People are listening, people aren't believing, and that seems to be the problem with these relentless sexual assault accusations against Donald Trump.
[00:57:47.265 --> 00:57:48.226]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:57:48.246 --> 00:57:51.208]  This is the Alex Jones Show, live breaking news at infowars.com.
[00:57:51.228 --> 00:57:51.728]  Don't go away.

[00:58:02.211 --> 00:58:05.854]  Alpha Power has a 4.8 star rating on InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:06.134 --> 00:58:09.697]  Listen to all these incredible five star reviews from verified buyers.
[00:58:10.017 --> 00:58:13.140]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:22.707]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin, and it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[00:58:22.847 --> 00:58:25.208]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[00:58:25.428 --> 00:58:27.128]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[00:58:27.328 --> 00:58:29.969]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[00:58:30.229 --> 00:58:34.750]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:41.172]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[00:58:41.592 --> 00:58:46.093]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[00:58:46.113 --> 00:58:49.114]  It helps with focus too, like Brain Force Plus.
[00:58:49.654 --> 00:58:53.759]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products and they're always of supreme quality.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:58.225]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[00:58:58.505 --> 00:59:00.047]  There's definitely been a change.
[00:59:00.307 --> 00:59:00.948]  For the better.
[00:59:01.389 --> 00:59:05.153]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased and that's fine by me.
[00:59:05.574 --> 00:59:07.236]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[00:59:07.656 --> 00:59:08.537]  I hope this lasts.
[00:59:09.378 --> 00:59:11.419]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:17.843]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[00:59:18.143 --> 00:59:23.066]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:26.848]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[00:59:27.449 --> 00:59:32.472]  Taking one capsule a day in the AM, and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[00:59:33.032 --> 00:59:34.853]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[00:59:35.113 --> 00:59:35.634]  Not anymore.
[00:59:36.014 --> 00:59:37.215]  Seem to be sleeping better too.
[00:59:37.775 --> 00:59:39.616]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[00:59:39.856 --> 00:59:41.237]  I will definitely buy this again.
[00:59:42.018 --> 00:59:45.340]  Head to infowarsstore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.262]  That's infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:55.206 --> 01:00:01.110]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.762 --> 01:00:15.423]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:17.144]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.704 --> 01:00:18.824]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:21.066]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:21.306 --> 01:00:22.426]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.946 --> 01:00:27.669]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:34.619]  It is Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones coming up in the third and fourth hours.
[01:00:34.659 --> 01:00:36.739]  We have the one and only Milo Yiannopoulos.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.100]  For now, we'll head back into the news.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.721]  I was talking about this story before the break.
[01:00:41.521 --> 01:00:53.305]  Again, this accuser, this Trump accuser, claiming that he, God forbid, asked for her phone number, the horror, is now claiming that Trump kissed her for two minutes, accosted her in Trump Tower.
[01:00:53.705 --> 01:00:55.466]  Trump's up on Twitter denying it.
[01:00:56.545 --> 01:01:06.479]  Now a flashback to this story which we had in December where Bill O'Reilly was predicting a new sexual assault claim or a slew of sexual assault claims against Trump.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.926]  They tried to roll into this whole Me Too crescendo.
[01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:21.137]  Trying to scalp Donald Trump with that narrative, it doesn't appear as though they've been successful because they just keep recycling the same stories over and over again.
[01:01:21.757 --> 01:01:27.321]  Because back in December, you see the headline there, huge fake sex assault claim against Trump coming in January.
[01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:28.722]  That didn't happen.
[01:01:28.742 --> 01:01:31.484]  They just recycled what we already knew about or heard about.
[01:01:32.276 --> 01:01:33.437]  Will they try this again?
[01:01:33.497 --> 01:01:40.362]  Will they come out with new victims claiming that they were assaulted or accosted by Donald Trump with no evidence whatsoever to back it up?
[01:01:40.422 --> 01:01:41.363]  It remains to be seen.
[01:01:41.663 --> 01:01:44.465]  But Trump is tweeting about it again this morning.
[01:01:46.106 --> 01:01:48.788]  Also, he's tweeting about Russian collusion once again.
[01:01:48.848 --> 01:01:50.310]  Headline, Trump tweet storm.
[01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:54.813]  President Trump takes on Obama for not taking action against Russian election interference.
[01:01:55.814 --> 01:01:58.336]  President Trump cut loose on Twitter again Tuesday morning.
[01:01:58.356 --> 01:02:01.398]  The Republican president went off on Barack Obama
[01:02:02.634 --> 01:02:06.958]  The Democratic Party in the far-left's Russia collusion hoax, which again is completely boring at this point.
[01:02:06.998 --> 01:02:12.583]  They've indicted another lawyer today who's tangentially implicated with Manafort.
[01:02:12.603 --> 01:02:13.503]  It's completely boring.
[01:02:13.523 --> 01:02:18.267]  They've got nothing whatsoever on Trump, nothing directly as it pertains to collusion on his campaign.
[01:02:18.788 --> 01:02:21.991]  But the drumbeat continues from day to day to day.
[01:02:23.132 --> 01:02:25.013]  And now Trump is addressing it on Twitter.
[01:02:25.073 --> 01:02:27.856]  He says, I've been much tougher on Russia than Obama.
[01:02:28.096 --> 01:02:29.177]  Just look at the facts.
[01:02:29.257 --> 01:02:30.318]  Total fake news.
[01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:39.098]  He went on to say, to hit former President Obama for his famous quote on election integrity before the election, when Barack Obama thought Hillary Clinton would win.
[01:02:39.638 --> 01:02:40.239]  Remember that?
[01:02:40.279 --> 01:02:45.064]  When Hillary Clinton came out and said, oh, Trump's going to say that it was rigged when I win.
[01:02:45.104 --> 01:02:49.129]  And of course, she was the one that came out and said it was rigged when she lost.
[01:02:50.163 --> 01:02:55.446]  Trump said, quote, there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections.
[01:02:55.947 --> 01:02:57.447]  He's quoting Obama, of course, here.
[01:02:57.788 --> 01:03:00.629]  There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time.
[01:03:00.649 --> 01:03:04.392]  So I invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.
[01:03:04.552 --> 01:03:14.878]  That is Trump in a tweet this morning, quoting what Obama said, basically suggesting people who claim American elections are rigged are completely stupid.
[01:03:15.678 --> 01:03:18.000]  Of course, that's exactly what they claimed when they lost.
[01:03:19.031 --> 01:03:22.193]  Trump went on to say the President Obama quote just before the election.
[01:03:22.213 --> 01:03:26.916]  That's because he thought crooked Hillary was going to win, and then he didn't want to rock the boat.
[01:03:27.377 --> 01:03:32.820]  When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed, and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.
[01:03:33.541 --> 01:03:35.742]  So again, he's bashing Obama.
[01:03:35.782 --> 01:03:41.506]  He's bashing Hillary Clinton on the fact that they relentlessly talked about this rigging of elections.
[01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:42.607]  They lost.
[01:03:43.227 --> 01:03:47.650]  And it was them complaining about elections being rigged, and then he had the anti-Trump riots and everything after that.
[01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:48.771]  We also have
[01:03:49.873 --> 01:03:56.682]  On the subject of Russian collusion, CNN and MSNBC helped Russia sow discord by promoting fake anti-Trump rally.
[01:03:57.203 --> 01:04:01.469]  And who showed up at one of these Russian operated rallies?
[01:04:01.509 --> 01:04:04.593]  Well, it was none other than the odious blob, Michael Moore.
[01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:10.652]  Fox News reports Michael Moore participated in an anti-Trump rally allegedly organized by Russians.
[01:04:11.252 --> 01:04:22.938]  The filmmaker, who has long accused President Trump of colluding with the Russians, posted videos and pictures of himself, and they're actually in this article, participating in a protest in Manhattan that was allegedly organized by Russians in November 2016.
[01:04:25.456 --> 01:04:32.742]  So he was virtue signaling about how Trump was not responding to this protest, about how Trump was in bed with the Russians.
[01:04:33.162 --> 01:04:40.328]  Meanwhile, the Russians were literally behind this protest at which Michael Moore was an attendee.
[01:04:40.949 --> 01:04:42.610]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:46.033]  As the only Russian collusion, it appears, was between
[01:04:46.913 --> 01:04:54.977]  Elements of the anti-Trump resistance, of course, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, were more closely tied to Russia than anyone in the Trump campaign.
[01:04:55.497 --> 01:04:57.578]  No evidence has come out to prove anything otherwise.
[01:04:57.598 --> 01:04:58.919]  Thus far, we'll be back.
[01:04:58.959 --> 01:05:00.480]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.040]  Don't go away.

[01:05:33.424 --> 01:05:38.148]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globals, but they're striking back all over the world.
[01:05:38.408 --> 01:05:43.952]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.

[01:06:06.363 --> 01:06:13.165]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:18.607]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:06:20.308 --> 01:06:20.968]  We're live!
[01:06:21.248 --> 01:06:24.609]  It is the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:24.629 --> 01:06:32.492]  Before we dig back into this news and some breaking news up on InfoWars.com, I want to tell you again about the great specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:32.512 --> 01:06:34.513]  We have limited time only Cell Force,
[01:06:35.302 --> 01:06:39.846]  On InfoWorld's Life at 53% off discount, that's £69.95.
[01:06:40.307 --> 01:06:49.155]  Several years ago, we teamed up with Doctor Group to create DNA Force and other incredible InfoWorld's Life formulas because they had outstanding standards.
[01:06:49.556 --> 01:06:57.623]  After a few years of delivering these powerful formulas, we wanted to improve on DNA Force and its BioPQQ formula to help you get the best for less.
[01:06:58.384 --> 01:07:00.346]  So now we have Cell Force.
[01:07:01.064 --> 01:07:06.169]  We've turned DNA Force into this powerful new formula that utilizes the best ingredients possible.
[01:07:06.709 --> 01:07:14.876]  Other formulas with these ingredients would cost up to $300, but we wanted to bring you that quality of product for less.
[01:07:15.637 --> 01:07:25.326]  And again, it is Cell Force available right now at InfoWarsStore.com and DNA Force, which is there at a 53% discount.
[01:07:25.386 --> 01:07:27.448]  Again, huge discount, not going to stick around for long.
[01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:30.160]  Get the product, support this network.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.283]  We also have BODYS, which is the product that I've been taking.
[01:07:33.903 --> 01:07:36.606]  Whole body support, anti-inflammatory support.
[01:07:36.626 --> 01:07:41.770]  I had a chest complaint, which was causing problems with breathing and inflamed chest cavity.
[01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:43.491]  This has helped greatly.
[01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:45.032]  I've been taking it for about 10 days.
[01:07:46.073 --> 01:07:47.774]  It is BODYS whole body support.
[01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.356]  You get 120 capsules.
[01:07:49.956 --> 01:07:51.377]  That's going to last you for two months.
[01:07:51.397 --> 01:07:52.118]  You take two a day.
[01:07:52.498 --> 01:07:54.760]  And of course, it's based on turmeric.
[01:07:55.655 --> 01:08:02.599]  Which is known to alleviate depression in terms of being better than some antidepressants, according to scientific studies.
[01:08:02.639 --> 01:08:09.303]  So in addition to the reason we sell it, which is the anti-inflammatory support, it has other great benefits too.
[01:08:09.883 --> 01:08:10.784]  It is turmeric.
[01:08:11.924 --> 01:08:19.709]  It is available right now for £49.95 for a huge bottle, 120 capsules, 60 day supply at infowarsstore.com.
[01:08:19.989 --> 01:08:21.870]  You can also get the auto-ship option
[01:08:22.785 --> 01:08:27.146]  Which again enables you to get these products without having to remember to order them.
[01:08:27.186 --> 01:08:32.608]  How annoying is it when you keep having to remember to order something that you take every day that you want to continue to get?
[01:08:32.628 --> 01:08:34.989]  That's not a problem with the Autoship option.
[01:08:35.009 --> 01:08:44.052]  You also get a further 10% subscription discount on top of all the other discounts at infowarsstore.com with the Autoship option.
[01:08:44.812 --> 01:08:46.973]  That is bodies, whole body support.
[01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:48.753]  I personally can highly recommend it.
[01:08:48.773 --> 01:08:51.154]  Available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:08:53.405 --> 01:09:08.018]  Now, talking about Trump derangement syndrome, of course, Jennifer Lawrence came out a few months ago and basically said that the hurricanes that were happening over that time period, September to October, were the result of God's wrath, because Americans voted for Donald Trump.
[01:09:08.058 --> 01:09:09.619]  Yes, she literally said that.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:17.086]  Well, now she's taking a break from acting, which of course is nothing to do with the fact that her last movie was a complete flop, honestly.
[01:09:18.573 --> 01:09:20.555]  To quote, fix our democracy.
[01:09:20.755 --> 01:09:22.116]  This is a headline out of Breitbart.
[01:09:22.136 --> 01:09:25.279]  Jennifer Lawrence taking a break from acting to fix our democracy.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:31.725]  Hollywood A-lister Jennifer Lawrence says she's taking a sabbatical from acting so she can help fix our democracy.
[01:09:32.326 --> 01:09:35.369]  She's going to single-handedly fix the democracy.
[01:09:36.317 --> 01:09:42.520]  That brought a president to power via an electoral college win, completely in line with how democracy works.
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.841]  But she's going to fix it, even though it's not broken.
[01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:45.622]  She's going to fix it.
[01:09:45.742 --> 01:09:46.622]  She's the expert.
[01:09:46.662 --> 01:09:47.683]  She's Jennifer Lawrence.
[01:09:47.743 --> 01:09:49.444]  I mean, come on.
[01:09:49.804 --> 01:09:52.525]  She thinks God sends hurricanes to punish Trump voters.
[01:09:52.965 --> 01:09:53.726]  She's the expert.
[01:09:54.066 --> 01:09:56.267]  She's the credible party in this equation.
[01:09:56.887 --> 01:09:59.669]  She said, quote, I'm going to take the next year off.
[01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:05.253]  And again, that's nothing to do with the fact that she's a failed actor whose movies continue to flop over and over again.
[01:10:05.293 --> 01:10:06.554]  Honestly, it's nothing to do with that.
[01:10:07.214 --> 01:10:18.804]  So she's going to take a year off explaining how she will work with a self-described anti-corruption non-profit to, again, fix America's democracy, which isn't broken to begin with.
[01:10:19.524 --> 01:10:26.270]  She says, quote, I'm going to be working with this organization as part of represent.us, trying to get young people engaged politically on a local level.
[01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:33.261]  So in other words, she's trying to indoctrinate young people to imbibe in her Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:37.303]  She continued by saying it doesn't have anything to do with parties and politics.
[01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:39.365]  And you can believe that.
[01:10:40.045 --> 01:10:45.689]  It's just anti-corruption and stuff trying to pass state by state laws that can help prevent corruption, fix our democracy.
[01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:48.170]  Now, this is interesting.
[01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.052]  This is a quote from further on in the article.
[01:10:50.072 --> 01:10:52.093]  She said, I want to get a farm.
[01:10:52.913 --> 01:10:55.195]  I want to be like milking goats.
[01:10:56.027 --> 01:11:01.892]  Now I think those are the words of another celebrity who has been broken by Donald Trump.
[01:11:02.872 --> 01:11:08.416]  Much in the similar vein as Eminem, of course, who had a whining hissy fit about the fact that Trump refused to respond to him.
[01:11:08.977 --> 01:11:18.824]  Now Jennifer Lawrence is so traumatised by Trump, she's basically quitting acting for at least a year, and she's going to work on a farm, she's going to milk goats.
[01:11:19.805 --> 01:11:22.347]  Sounds like she's been broken by Donald Trump, doesn't it?
[01:11:22.447 --> 01:11:24.689]  Another hysterical celebrity.
[01:11:25.808 --> 01:11:30.191]  Let's talk about this though, because this is an absolutely shocking video which we're going to play here in a moment.
[01:11:31.092 --> 01:11:43.700]  Now this arose out of the LeBron James-Laura Ingraham controversy, because LeBron James, the basketball player, came out and said the number one job in America, the appointed person, is someone who doesn't understand the people.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.024]  He's talking about Donald Trump, the arch-criminal, the commander in evil.
[01:11:50.304 --> 01:11:51.125]  The athlete said,
[01:11:51.983 --> 01:11:55.104]  He added that some of the President's comments are laughable and scary.
[01:11:55.124 --> 01:12:04.727]  So Laura Ingram of Fox News responded to his comments, calling LeBron James barely intelligible and ungrammatical on her Fox News show.
[01:12:05.307 --> 01:12:07.627]  She continued, quote, So Laura Ingram had the nerve
[01:12:21.491 --> 01:12:27.156]  To face up, to strike back against LeBron James because he strayed into the political arena.
[01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:42.468]  And then what happened is this D-list actor who has basically not even been in anything known by anyone since like 2011, I didn't even know who he was, called Michael Rappaport attacking Laura Ingram.
[01:12:42.968 --> 01:12:47.652]  These are some of the most vile, actual misogynistic comments you will ever hear.
[01:12:48.582 --> 01:12:49.982]  In mainstream politics.
[01:12:50.522 --> 01:12:59.604]  Now I've said it over and over again, they reserve their most hateful vitriol, the most sexist hateful misogyny for conservative women.
[01:12:59.864 --> 01:13:07.345]  You've heard all the absolutely disgusting slurs against Ann Coulter which I can barely even talk about because they're full of c-words and f-words.
[01:13:08.605 --> 01:13:18.087]  Now Michael Rapoport, this nobody actor, has gone on an absolute unhinged rant against Laura Ingraham because she dared call out LeBron James
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:23.885]  For his comments, let's go to this heavily censored clip because it's full of profanity.
[01:13:23.905 --> 01:13:24.505]  Here's the clip.
[01:13:25.406 --> 01:13:26.707]  I'm apologizing in advance.
[01:13:26.807 --> 01:13:30.210]  I know this is going to offend some women, but I had to do it.
[01:13:30.771 --> 01:13:40.460]  This is for Laura Ingraham, the cock-eyed Fox News commentator with the Bobby Brown jaw who said that KD and LeBron James should just shut up and dribble.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.022]  No, Cluckhead, you shut up and dribble.
[01:13:43.282 --> 01:13:43.983]  These nuts...
[01:13:45.441 --> 01:13:50.465]  You mayonnaise eating, Melba toast, no seasoning on your chicken, cracker.
[01:13:50.925 --> 01:13:55.129]  Your butt is so flat that when you stand up, you can see your entire asshole.
[01:13:55.329 --> 01:13:56.150]  I'm sorry, ladies.
[01:13:56.410 --> 01:13:57.311]  I warned you at the top.
[01:13:57.891 --> 01:13:58.992]  You little stunt, you.
[01:13:59.372 --> 01:14:03.295]  Your lord and savior, Donald Trump, wouldn't even grab you by the pussy.
[01:14:03.475 --> 01:14:06.198]  And if he did, he'd probably get his fingers caught in a mousetrap.
[01:14:06.778 --> 01:14:08.920]  You went to college, Laura, and you're proud of that?
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.261]  And what do you got to show for it?
[01:14:10.481 --> 01:14:18.568]  A mouth full of fake teeth, a face full of Botox, and some dry-ass hair extensions, and you still never got f***ed right, you little jump-off, shut-up-and-dribble.
[01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:19.568]  Get the f*** out of here.
[01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:27.675]  That is D-list actor who nobody's ever heard of, Michael Rappaport, responding to Laura Ingram.
[01:14:28.195 --> 01:14:33.520]  Absolutely vile, vicious, profane-filled rant against Laura Ingram.
[01:14:34.148 --> 01:14:36.029]  Attacking her on her appearance.
[01:14:36.069 --> 01:14:39.151]  Of course, when Trump said that Rosie O'Donnell was fat, he was terrible.
[01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:43.914]  When he said that Megyn Kelly was bleeding out of her wherever, it was literally the worst thing on earth.
[01:14:44.374 --> 01:14:48.497]  This guy can get up and say far, far worse things about Laura Ingraham.
[01:14:49.057 --> 01:14:53.480]  And of course, he's praised, he's worshipped, he's got 10,000 retweets, everybody loves him now.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.121]  Isn't it ironic?
[01:14:55.808 --> 01:15:15.072]  Given this hateful, profanity-filled rant against women, that Michael Rapoport was dumped by his ex-girlfriend and was charged with aggravated harassment because after she dumped him, he started going insane and stalking her, calling her up 200 times, banging on her window.
[01:15:15.492 --> 01:15:16.912]  She had to get restraining order.
[01:15:16.952 --> 01:15:18.673]  He got charged with aggravated assault.
[01:15:19.013 --> 01:15:21.153]  That's his attitude towards women.
[01:15:21.853 --> 01:15:24.834]  So is it any surprise that this complete creep
[01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:34.024]  This piece of crap gets up there on Twitter and goes on the most unhinged, vile, vicious, misogynistic rant against Laura Ingraham.
[01:15:34.204 --> 01:15:35.405]  But that's not even the worst of it.
[01:15:35.425 --> 01:15:43.592]  The worst of it is he's worshipped by the left amidst this whole hashtag MeToo movement where everybody believes the victim.
[01:15:43.912 --> 01:15:47.115]  Everybody has to be respectful, very careful around women.
[01:15:47.615 --> 01:15:48.917]  He does the exact opposite.
[01:15:48.937 --> 01:15:50.679]  He goes on this unhinged vile rant.
[01:15:51.039 --> 01:15:51.740]  He's worshipped.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:52.661]  He's adored.
[01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:56.826]  Again, the left's double standard in evidence over and over again.
[01:15:57.086 --> 01:15:58.728]  And he's an actual harasser of women.
[01:15:59.028 --> 01:16:00.009]  What a piece of crap.
[01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:01.751]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:01.771 --> 01:16:02.232]  Don't go away.
[01:16:04.406 --> 01:16:06.808]  Our latest product, by the way, is Immunewald.
[01:16:07.548 --> 01:16:09.650]  It's very, very affordable at $29.95.
[01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:12.111]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:18.736]  And we set out with beta glucans, olive leaf, and a bunch of other key compounds that are absolutely documented.
[01:16:18.756 --> 01:16:30.003]  We can even make claims about what this does to bolster your immune system and make you healthier, especially if you're going to be traveling or you're under stress or it's in the winter months.
[01:16:30.563 --> 01:16:32.825]  This is something everybody should be taking.
[01:16:32.885 --> 01:16:34.126]  Wellmune is patented.
[01:16:35.167 --> 01:16:37.828]  And documented in all the hundreds of studies.
[01:16:38.889 --> 01:16:40.810]  Then you got the ancient stuff there as well.
[01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:45.533]  The organic olive leaf extract is what the Roman soldiers would take whenever they started getting sick.
[01:16:45.954 --> 01:16:49.376]  Just chopped full of all those key enzymes and vitamin C and so much more.
[01:16:49.836 --> 01:16:55.900]  Then it's got all the concentrated highest quality organic types of mushrooms that are documented for your body.
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:01.224]  And then concentrated citrus peel, orange peel, lemon peel, organic orange peel.
[01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:05.971]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not going to sit here and hype this product up.
[01:17:07.072 --> 01:17:14.478]  So whether it's the sleep aid knockout you need, which is amazing, melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:17:14.818 --> 01:17:19.162]  And I said, I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much are you in that?
[01:17:19.762 --> 01:17:26.108]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[01:17:27.506 --> 01:17:49.737]  And I said, so, I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and several other things, and I checked with scientists, none of them interact badly, they're all from nature, they're all healthy, they all have good, you know, good clean records, and then you get a sleep unlike other systems.
[01:17:51.109 --> 01:17:55.673]  Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:57.235]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[01:17:57.255 --> 01:17:59.157]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:17:59.177 --> 01:18:01.058]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:18:01.739 --> 01:18:03.961]  He doesn't smoke marijuana, doesn't drink.
[01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:06.764]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:18:07.284 --> 01:18:08.886]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:18:08.906 --> 01:18:10.928]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:18:12.136 --> 01:18:15.259]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:16.160]  This is insane.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.541]  Wow, it's incredible.
[01:18:17.581 --> 01:18:19.603]  I've taken melatonin up by itself and it didn't help.
[01:18:20.143 --> 01:18:20.984]  Wow, this is incredible.
[01:18:21.284 --> 01:18:22.345]  And I said, yeah, I don't know.
[01:18:22.385 --> 01:18:27.370]  I just had the idea to mix everything known, you know, scientifically and the wives tales together to make you sleep.
[01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:28.391]  And, you know, it's powerful.
[01:18:29.051 --> 01:18:30.192]  And they're all game changers.
[01:18:30.212 --> 01:18:35.037]  You need to really go read the third-party reviews or power reviews and others that we have linked.
[01:18:35.657 --> 01:18:40.542]  Our average review on InfoWorksStore.com, there's more than 40,000 reviews now, is 94%.
[01:18:40.722 --> 01:18:49.630]  They even had media investigations with BuzzFeed and people calling them going, we want to see it, it must be fake, blah, blah, blah.
[01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:51.332]  They're like, no, it's really real.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.522]  So, they've got campaigns that people go on there and try to vote stuff down.
[01:18:56.542 --> 01:19:06.367]  I mean, they are just so angry where they test our stuff and test it and test it in California labs that has stuff nine times higher than EU that has the next highest standards.
[01:19:06.727 --> 01:19:12.730]  I mean, basically, there's more lead in the air in California than you can, quote, put in a supplement or any other product, unless you call it a food product.
[01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:15.491]  What is it, 60-something of our products are all California standard.
[01:19:15.511 --> 01:19:17.412]  But if you've got something that's got, I don't know,
[01:19:18.072 --> 01:19:19.053]  10-15 ingredients in it.
[01:19:19.093 --> 01:19:20.875]  It's also a large serving like caveman.
[01:19:21.196 --> 01:19:27.342]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, any can of chicken noodle soup has probably five times the lead California says is allowed.
[01:19:27.482 --> 01:19:28.223]  It's just insane.
[01:19:28.684 --> 01:19:31.787]  And then we test and test and test more than anybody we know of because we know.
[01:19:31.807 --> 01:19:34.210]  Now we're under a microscope, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:38.851]  But thank you for committing to get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:19:39.152 --> 01:19:41.833]  Because it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:19:41.853 --> 01:19:48.675]  We're not like, it's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films, and you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:19:48.695 --> 01:19:51.796]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:19:52.136 --> 01:19:53.557]  It's called reap what you sow.
[01:19:55.417 --> 01:19:57.238]  That's available at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:20:06.443 --> 01:20:09.164]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:26.667]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.147 --> 01:20:30.848]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:20:33.479 --> 01:20:35.760]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:42.322]  Milo Yiannopoulos is coming up in the next hour and in the fourth hour, so you get to enjoy two hours solid of Milo.
[01:20:42.382 --> 01:20:44.223]  Before the break, I was talking about this headline.
[01:20:44.323 --> 01:20:47.384]  Michael Rapoport attacks Laura Ingraham over LeBron comments.
[01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:49.304]  Dribble these nuts.
[01:20:49.925 --> 01:20:51.085]  Then he calls her a cuss word.
[01:20:51.815 --> 01:20:57.317]  Basically, this D-list nobody engaged in a vile, vitriolic, hateful rant against women.
[01:20:57.597 --> 01:20:59.238]  He's talking about her being a cracker.
[01:20:59.678 --> 01:21:01.559]  He's talking about her physical appearance.
[01:21:01.819 --> 01:21:03.039]  Absolutely disgusting.
[01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:04.460]  And it's the tone of voice.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.181]  It's the look across his face.
[01:21:07.641 --> 01:21:11.202]  Looks like an absolute deranged nutcase when he's engaged in this rant.
[01:21:11.962 --> 01:21:18.565]  Funny thing is about this, Michael Rapoport, the D-list actor who nobody knows or cares about, which is why he needs to do this in the first place,
[01:21:19.159 --> 01:21:21.920]  He's an actual sexual harasser of women!
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:23.880]  Oh, isn't that coincidence?
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.600]  How many times have we seen this?
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:37.203]  Where these virtue signallers, the most aggressive virtue signallers about MeToo, about feminism, about respecting women, in every case turn out to be sexual harassers of women.
[01:21:37.563 --> 01:21:39.743]  Overcompensation much, do you think?
[01:21:41.324 --> 01:21:42.704]  There's a headline about this guy.
[01:21:43.502 --> 01:21:45.123]  ...whose ex-girlfriend dumped him.
[01:21:45.143 --> 01:21:48.744]  The headline is, I'm not Rappaport's, but Lily X's persists.
[01:21:49.124 --> 01:21:50.424]  Lily's ex persists.
[01:21:51.165 --> 01:21:58.307]  It talks about his relationship with his ex-girlfriend, which the article, and I think this is the New York Post, says, took a scary turn last month.
[01:21:58.787 --> 01:22:01.428]  Now this is a while back, but again, it shows the hypocrisy here.
[01:22:01.448 --> 01:22:09.250]  It says, Rappaport, who was featured in Mighty Aphrodite and Beautiful Girls, again, never heard of those, don't know what they are, was dating Taylor for months.
[01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:11.151]  So he was dating this Lily Taylor woman.
[01:22:12.196 --> 01:22:16.417]  And it says the diminutive 30-year-old is best known for her roles in Mystic Peace and I Shot Andy Warhol.
[01:22:16.957 --> 01:22:18.998]  So they were frequently seen around New York.
[01:22:19.038 --> 01:22:19.738]  They were dating.
[01:22:20.278 --> 01:22:24.899]  Eventually, Taylor, the girl, wanted out of the relationship.
[01:22:25.279 --> 01:22:29.640]  But after she broke up with the actor, he continued to haunt her.
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:33.901]  New York City police confirm that Rappaport was arrested May 18th.
[01:22:35.057 --> 01:22:45.422]  The victim, Lily Taylor, made a report May 17th, saying that the suspect repeatedly telephoned her, alarmed her, annoyed her, and banged on her apartment window.
[01:22:46.482 --> 01:22:47.303]  What a creep!
[01:22:47.823 --> 01:22:48.903]  What a piece of crap!
[01:22:50.604 --> 01:22:58.648]  According to Police Officer Kathy Kelly, he banged on her apartment window, he's calling her, telephoning her, repeatedly stalking her, after she dumped him!
[01:23:00.211 --> 01:23:05.655]  Quote, he was subsequently arrested by the Six Squad and charged with two counts of aggravated harassment.
[01:23:06.336 --> 01:23:24.909]  So you have a vile nobody, who's literally a harasser of women, charged with aggravated harassment, getting up there and spewing the most vile invective against Laura Ingram, because Laura Ingram dared tell LeBron James to shut up with his Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:23:25.891 --> 01:23:30.536]  She didn't engage in any kind of attack based on his appearance or his identity or his skin colour.
[01:23:30.896 --> 01:23:32.018]  She attacked his argument.
[01:23:32.438 --> 01:23:39.245]  This creep, this piece of crap that nobody's ever heard of or cares about, Michael Rappaport, attacked Laura Ingraham's appearance.
[01:23:39.606 --> 01:23:42.048]  And we all joke about feminists being fat or whatever.
[01:23:42.389 --> 01:23:43.070]  It's banter.
[01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:44.231]  It's tongue-in-cheek, okay?
[01:23:44.983 --> 01:23:51.764]  There's a level that you get to where it just becomes a little bit too intense, a little bit vile, a little bit creepy.
[01:23:52.345 --> 01:23:55.665]  And he passed that red line, as you heard in that clip.
[01:23:55.685 --> 01:24:02.367]  Let's go to that video clip again of this nobody, Michael Rapoport, viciously attacking Laura Ingraham.
[01:24:02.707 --> 01:24:07.128]  Not on her argument, but on her appearance and the fact that she's a woman.
[01:24:07.168 --> 01:24:07.848]  Let's go to the clip.
[01:24:08.817 --> 01:24:10.158]  I'm apologizing in advance.
[01:24:10.238 --> 01:24:13.640]  I know this is going to offend some women, but I had to do it.
[01:24:14.201 --> 01:24:23.907]  This is for Laura Ingraham, the cock-eyed Fox News commentator with the Bobby Brown jaw who said that KD and LeBron James should just shut up and dribble.
[01:24:24.248 --> 01:24:26.449]  No, Cluckhead, you shut up and dribble.
[01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:27.410]  These nuts!
[01:24:28.871 --> 01:24:33.914]  You mayonnaise eating, Melba toast, no seasoning on your chicken, cracker.
[01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:38.577]  Your butt is so flat that when you stand up, you can see your entire asshole.
[01:24:38.758 --> 01:24:39.598]  I'm sorry, ladies.
[01:24:39.858 --> 01:24:40.759]  I warned you at the top.
[01:24:41.319 --> 01:24:42.440]  You little stunt you.
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:46.743]  Your lord and savior, Donald Trump, wouldn't even grab you by the pussy.
[01:24:46.923 --> 01:24:49.625]  And if he did, he'd probably get his fingers caught in a mousetrap.
[01:24:50.225 --> 01:24:52.366]  You went to college, Laura, and you're proud of that?
[01:24:52.566 --> 01:24:53.686]  And what do you got to show for it?
[01:24:53.926 --> 01:25:02.108]  A mouth full of fake teeth, a face full of Botox, and some dry-ass hair extensions, and you still never got f***ed right, you little jump-off, shut-up-and-dribble.
[01:25:02.128 --> 01:25:02.988]  F*** outta here.
[01:25:04.549 --> 01:25:16.171]  What kind of individual engages- that's like a minute-long invective vicious rant about her appearance, about the fact that she's white, he's white, he's racist on top of being sexist.
[01:25:16.852 --> 01:25:18.332]  Absolutely disgraceful!
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:25.443]  And of course it turns out that he actually sexually harassed a woman and was charged with two cases of aggravated assault.
[01:25:25.723 --> 01:25:27.224]  What a piece of crap!
[01:25:27.624 --> 01:25:28.765]  What they're all worshipping in.
[01:25:29.105 --> 01:25:33.487]  All the same people who talk about Me Too every single day until they're blue in the face.
[01:25:33.887 --> 01:25:34.948]  All love this guy!
[01:25:35.608 --> 01:25:36.809]  What an absolute creep!
[01:25:37.689 --> 01:25:43.372]  Moving on from that, talking about the divisive climate in America right now, we have this story up on InfoWars.com.
[01:25:44.528 --> 01:25:49.832]  Of course we had the NRA banner hang, the billboard which said basically kill NRA members.
[01:25:49.852 --> 01:25:55.496]  We had the Facebook group calling on people to kill Republicans as revenge for the Florida high school attack.
[01:25:55.976 --> 01:25:57.998]  Now I have this video up on Infowars.com.
[01:25:58.518 --> 01:26:02.121]  Native American gets beat down after assaulting Trump voter.
[01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:04.744]  This is a video on Infowars.com.
[01:26:04.784 --> 01:26:09.385]  A self-described Native American got his butt handed to him after he assaulted a Trump supporter.
[01:26:09.785 --> 01:26:20.307]  So he basically got triggered by the fact that one of the guys in the clip was wearing a Make America Great Again hat, which he said, quote, that effing hat caused genocide.
[01:26:21.427 --> 01:26:23.528]  It was unclear what genocide he was referring to.
[01:26:23.568 --> 01:26:30.289]  The Native American then knocked the hat off the cameraman's friend who promptly defended himself, much to the shock of the Native American.
[01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:34.003]  Who whined, what the F, as he took a barrage of fists.
[01:26:34.023 --> 01:26:39.988]  So he was so shocked that this guy, who he was assaulting, actually fought back.
[01:26:40.928 --> 01:26:50.395]  The article continues, it appears that Trump derangement syndrome is now leading to Popeye syndrome, in which wimps think they're invincible and capable of starting confrontations despite never taking a punch to the face.
[01:26:51.096 --> 01:26:56.620]  And you look at this clip, and again, it's another odious little blob who thinks he's a tough guy.
[01:26:57.583 --> 01:26:59.004]  Quickly proven otherwise.
[01:26:59.044 --> 01:27:04.526]  But again, Trump supporters are getting attacked on the streets simply for wearing a MAGA hat.
[01:27:04.866 --> 01:27:13.150]  And yet the entire narrative in the news media, again, is that all the hate, all the resentment is being directed from Trump supporters towards the left.
[01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:25.696]  When it's all going in the opposite direction, most of the hate crimes or a significant portion of the hate crimes that they blame on, you know, the Trump era, have been completely proven to be false in many cases.
[01:27:26.593 --> 01:27:33.376]  We have these incidents on a weekly basis almost, more in some cases, no media attention whatsoever.
[01:27:33.476 --> 01:27:37.597]  It'll get on YouTube, it'll get a few thousand views, it won't go beyond that.
[01:27:37.657 --> 01:27:39.498]  This is the climate we're living in.
[01:27:40.318 --> 01:27:47.781]  Now talking about the sexual harassment of women, of course the actual problem, the actual virulent problem with the sexual harassment of women
[01:27:48.382 --> 01:28:01.691]  Which is migrants coming into Europe and the West in general and treating women as second-class citizens continues not only to get very little media attention but to be openly decried by the left when anyone points it out.
[01:28:02.392 --> 01:28:08.997]  This headline is up on Breitbart.com activists against migrant violence towards women protest at Berlin Film Festival.
[01:28:10.157 --> 01:28:18.003]  This 120 DB group has been formed in Germany to protest against migrant violence of course violent crime through the roof in Germany after the importation of
[01:28:18.934 --> 01:28:23.597]  Almost two million, I think it was, by the end of it Muslim migrants continues to happen.
[01:28:23.737 --> 01:28:37.067]  Now activists from the anti-migrant violence women's movement 120 DB stormed a panel on harassment and violence against women in film and television industry at the Berlin Film Festival, holding a banner reading the voice of forgotten women.
[01:28:38.087 --> 01:28:47.050]  And guess what happened when they got up on the stage and tried to protest against the assault of women at this Berlin Film Festival event.
[01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:49.231]  We'll tell you what happened after the break.
[01:28:49.551 --> 01:28:53.353]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, breaking news at Infowars.com.
[01:28:53.373 --> 01:29:02.536]  We'll be back, don't go away.
[01:29:03.076 --> 01:29:05.297]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[01:29:06.224 --> 01:29:08.106]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:29:08.146 --> 01:29:17.554]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:29:18.655 --> 01:29:22.018]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:29:22.538 --> 01:29:24.901]  Thank you so much Alex for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:29:25.101 --> 01:29:25.762]  They are quality.
[01:29:25.782 --> 01:29:27.003]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:29:27.083 --> 01:29:29.485]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:29:45.241 --> 01:29:58.147]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:11.145]  Dr. Mark Faber is an amazing individual, a lot of great economic predictions and laurels under his belt.
[01:30:11.646 --> 01:30:15.369]  He's Mark Faber, editor and publisher of the Gloom, Boom and Doom Report.
[01:30:15.389 --> 01:30:20.232]  I could ask a lot of questions, but I want him to cover the waterfront from the Gloom, Boom, Doom Report.
[01:30:20.593 --> 01:30:22.314]  Thank you so much for joining us, doctor.
[01:30:22.414 --> 01:30:23.635]  Well, my pleasure, Alex.
[01:30:23.875 --> 01:30:24.936]  What should we tackle first?
[01:30:25.016 --> 01:30:26.017]  So much is going on.
[01:30:26.177 --> 01:30:26.437]  Yes.
[01:30:26.737 --> 01:30:32.482]  Well, we can talk about the global economy, which is kind of strengthening somewhat.
[01:30:33.262 --> 01:30:40.629]  But as you know, a lot of this strength is due to government deficits and to money printing.
[01:30:40.689 --> 01:30:49.658]  In other words, the expansion of balance sheets of central banks and, of course, of credit growth, which is very strong.
[01:30:50.558 --> 01:30:54.242]  So it's kind of a mixed recovery.
[01:30:55.211 --> 01:30:57.333]  It's been very good for assets.
[01:30:57.994 --> 01:31:06.462]  Asset prices since 2009 have not only recovered, but they've gone and made new highs.
[01:31:07.142 --> 01:31:11.486]  Funds, stocks, dollar was strong until a year ago.
[01:31:12.828 --> 01:31:17.112]  Commodities have also done quite well over the last 12 months.
[01:31:19.571 --> 01:31:24.094]  So the real estate has equally gone up around the world.
[01:31:24.794 --> 01:31:32.959]  We had a really an exceptional kind of a asset recovery asset bubble, I would say.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:41.865]  And that has led to a stronger economic growth that looks reasonably good on the surface.
[01:31:41.945 --> 01:31:43.466]  But if you dig deeper,
[01:31:44.501 --> 01:31:47.502]  It's, of course, unstable economic growth.
[01:31:47.682 --> 01:32:01.887]  If you look at the last 20-30 years, wealthy people, in other words, the asset holders, have become immensely rich as a result of money printing and credit growth.
[01:32:02.807 --> 01:32:11.930]  And the average household, the typical household in the US, the typical household in Western countries in Europe,
[01:32:12.606 --> 01:32:16.916]  has had a essentially a declining standard of living.
[01:32:17.885 --> 01:32:29.895]  I would actually say that most boomers, people like myself, born just after the war, their children will die poorer than we will die, and they will earn less money.
[01:32:29.955 --> 01:32:35.319]  And this is statistically proven that in real terms, inflation adjusted, they earn less.
[01:32:35.499 --> 01:32:38.922]  There's nothing you can do against this relative decline.
[01:32:38.962 --> 01:32:40.983]  You can try to age well.
[01:32:41.243 --> 01:32:43.345]  I'm in a relative decline.
[01:32:43.525 --> 01:32:46.768]  I'm not as strong as I was when I was 20 years old.
[01:32:48.174 --> 01:32:52.217]  I can't do sports as well as when I was 25 years old.
[01:32:53.198 --> 01:32:54.839]  So I'm in a relative decline.
[01:32:55.299 --> 01:32:59.362]  But I can try to age well as you as well as you.
[01:32:59.862 --> 01:33:01.423]  So we have to try to do that.
[01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:09.108]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.502 --> 01:33:30.073]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:30.534 --> 01:33:34.360]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:39.359]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:39.399 --> 01:33:42.060]  Milo Yiannopoulos is coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:49.323]  For now, before we head back into the news, I want to tell you about the massive discount special we've got right now at infowarsstore.com.

[01:34:05.125 --> 01:34:07.587]  All the top brands have sodium fluoride.
[01:34:08.048 --> 01:34:11.631]  It's been linked to numerous diseases, of course, lowering of IQs.
[01:34:11.671 --> 01:34:15.594]  We've been relentlessly harping on this for over 10 years now.
[01:34:16.457 --> 01:34:21.561]  And while you try to keep your mouth clean, you may be filling your body with unnatural ingredients and fluoride.

[01:35:07.586 --> 01:35:11.349]  It has the peppermint oil, the xylitol, the iodine, nanosilver and more.

[01:35:14.372 --> 01:35:18.195]  If you don't like the peppermint flavor, if you think that's too strong, we've got bubblegum flavor.

[01:35:45.976 --> 01:35:54.599]  We're not beholden to CNN, like CNN is beholden to, for example, Middle Eastern dictatorships, who they take their money from to produce puff pieces.
[01:35:55.039 --> 01:35:58.960]  We're not beholden to checks from George Soros, like Media Matters and others.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:03.501]  So our content is not dictated by outside forces.
[01:36:03.561 --> 01:36:05.441]  We're truly independent.
[01:36:05.821 --> 01:36:08.282]  And that's all because of your support.
[01:36:08.342 --> 01:36:10.322]  We wouldn't be able to do it otherwise.

[01:36:21.755 --> 01:36:26.295]  Like, 3,300 plus independent reviews on that product.
[01:36:26.696 --> 01:36:29.796]  An average score of 4.8 out of 5.
[01:36:30.416 --> 01:36:37.278]  Absolutely massive praise for the Super Blue fluoride-free products at infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:37.298 --> 01:36:39.678]  Available right now at 50% off.
[01:36:39.778 --> 01:36:41.298]  Please get them today.
[01:36:41.318 --> 01:36:43.819]  I was talking about this before the break.
[01:36:44.677 --> 01:36:58.743]  Activists from an anti-migrant violence women's movement which has sprung up over the past few weeks, 120DB, which of course is being completely condemned and castigated by the same media that bangs on about hashtag me too all day long.
[01:36:58.763 --> 01:37:05.025]  They got up in front of this Berlin film festival, held up a banner which said the voice of forgotten women.
[01:37:05.845 --> 01:37:19.208]  In reference to the fact that almost on a weekly basis, if not more, women are being sexually harassed, women are being raped, in some cases women are being murdered, the violent crime level has exploded since they imported
[01:37:20.026 --> 01:37:22.968]  Muslim migrants who treat women as second-class citizens.
[01:37:23.008 --> 01:37:37.737]  These brave women are trying to draw attention to that in opposition to feminists in Germany who literally, after the Cologne mass molestation of women, which involved thousands of victims, went to the local migrant centre the day after and handed out roses.
[01:37:38.658 --> 01:37:42.020]  They sided with the actual perpetrators in some cases.
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:45.582]  These brave women are standing up for the actual victims.
[01:37:46.082 --> 01:37:47.223]  And guess what happened?
[01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:52.333]  The female activists were promptly shouted at and labelled Nazis.
[01:37:52.973 --> 01:38:01.037]  Yeah, you're a Nazi if you recognise the true threat to women based on the actual crime stats released by the government and then draw attention to it.
[01:38:01.277 --> 01:38:02.338]  That makes you a Nazi.
[01:38:03.619 --> 01:38:16.586]  So they shouted Nazi at them, they chanted Nazis out while the women bravely held their own, held their banner with a sign showing a picture of 11-year-old Stockholm terror victim Ebba Akerlund and we're going to have more on that soon as well.
[01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:27.804]  The article goes on to say actress Jasmine Tabatabi, who sat on the panel, labelled the women Nazis, saying it was probably neo-Nazis who thought they had to blow up the programme.
[01:38:28.104 --> 01:38:30.745]  I do not know if it really makes sense to debate with such people.
[01:38:31.325 --> 01:38:39.007]  Yeah, don't debate with them, don't interact, don't actually give them a platform or actually ask them, engage them in a conversation, because we can't have that, can we?
[01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:40.488]  Just label them Nazis.
[01:38:41.545 --> 01:38:42.585]  And say they have no argument.
[01:38:42.665 --> 01:38:46.466]  Even though you can't address their argument, you just throw ad hominems at them.
[01:38:46.766 --> 01:38:47.706]  That's disgusting.
[01:38:48.166 --> 01:39:03.089]  Breitbart London spoke exclusively with 120DB activist Friar from Dresden, who said the 120DB movement is there to draw attention to the imported sexual violence against European women committed by mostly Muslim immigrants.
[01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:05.770]  How dare they even utter that thought crime?
[01:39:06.522 --> 01:39:10.103]  We did not and never will negate that there are other forms of violence against women.
[01:39:10.443 --> 01:39:14.604]  So they're not saying that this is the sole problem, they're just saying this is a big part of it.
[01:39:15.184 --> 01:39:17.885]  Why are you literally shouting us down as Nazis?
[01:39:18.305 --> 01:39:20.425]  Simply because we're trying to draw attention to it.
[01:39:20.885 --> 01:39:26.747]  Case after case of molestation, rape of women in Germany committed by these migrants.
[01:39:27.407 --> 01:39:35.349]  Freya called the panel hypocritical saying you can damage anyone's reputation by stating that he raped you with his eyes or complimented you in an appropriate way but as soon as you mention
[01:39:36.107 --> 01:39:44.133]  That there's been a significant increase in sexual violence of extraordinary brutality against women that correlates with the uncontrolled mass immigration from Muslim countries.
[01:39:44.613 --> 01:39:51.919]  You get shut down by the media and left-wing activists calling you a Nazi and a fascist for simply stating facts and telling the truth.
[01:39:52.559 --> 01:39:59.024]  Gee, it's almost like all those virtue signallers on the left don't actually care about women.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:11.369]  And just care about exploiting hyped up sexual harassment of women in the case of the Me Too movement to pursue their own political agenda, which is about the obtaining of power.
[01:40:11.389 --> 01:40:16.113]  I mean, fundamentally, this is about overthrowing the patriarchy in their own words.
[01:40:17.074 --> 01:40:23.639]  Meanwhile, you've got actual cases of sexual harassment exploding, not only in Germany, in other countries in Europe.
[01:40:24.159 --> 01:40:28.443]  These women have formed a group to draw attention to it, and they're getting attacked like never before.
[01:40:30.845 --> 01:40:38.835]  Given that, is it any surprise that this next headline tells us about the AFD becoming the second strongest party in Germany?
[01:40:39.415 --> 01:40:43.981]  Headline, German far-right AFD surpasses Social Democrats to become second strongest party.
[01:40:44.795 --> 01:40:49.437]  The populist far-right AFD party has garnered record high support, latest polling shows.
[01:40:49.997 --> 01:40:55.179]  For the first time, the anti-immigrant party has become more popular than the Social Democrats.
[01:40:55.239 --> 01:40:59.240]  Now, of course, they had the election in Germany, what was it, a couple of months ago now.
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:04.902]  The Social Democrats had to form this unshaky alliance with Angela Merkel's party.
[01:41:04.922 --> 01:41:07.143]  It took them weeks and weeks to try and figure it out.
[01:41:07.783 --> 01:41:09.123]  AFD came in third.
[01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:09.984]  They got about 12% of the votes.
[01:41:11.599 --> 01:41:13.159]  An excellent result all round.
[01:41:13.659 --> 01:41:16.200]  Now they're the second most popular party.
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.161]  So they're basically in front of Germany's version of the Democrats.
[01:41:21.181 --> 01:41:36.384]  I mean, that's how bad it is in Germany now, with the problems that have come as a result of this migrant wave, that this party, demonised as far-right, and let's not deny that there are some elements within it that are fringe, that are extremist, that are far-right,
[01:41:37.119 --> 01:41:39.320]  But even so, they got 12% of the vote.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.780]  They're now up to 16.
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:45.802]  They're more popular than Germany's second party in the space of about two months alone.
[01:41:47.002 --> 01:41:49.903]  What does that tell you about the situation in Germany?
[01:41:50.703 --> 01:41:56.545]  We also have Italy's election hopeful Salvini wants to deport 500,000 migrants.
[01:41:56.585 --> 01:41:59.826]  We also have an election in Italy next month in March.
[01:42:00.791 --> 01:42:09.698]  Now, in Italy, Berlusconi's Conservative Party and the Northern League, which is another Conservative right-wing party, look like they're going to win and form a coalition.
[01:42:10.199 --> 01:42:17.505]  The leader of Italy's Northern League party, Matteo Salvini, said he wants to deport half a million migrants within five years.
[01:42:18.271 --> 01:42:27.916]  Gee, I wonder why that is appealing to the Italian people right now, given how their port towns are being completely overrun by these boats coming in from Libya.
[01:42:28.456 --> 01:42:29.636]  So that's his platform.
[01:42:29.876 --> 01:42:35.119]  He wants to deport 500,000 migrants to try and get the situation back under control in Italy.
[01:42:36.008 --> 01:42:44.976]  He's likely to win and form a centre-right coalition with Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in the Italian elections on March 4th.
[01:42:45.597 --> 01:42:56.527]  So across Europe, in every single country, and we'll talk about Sweden in the next segment, there's a huge backlash to these disastrous policies in relation to the migrant crisis that we've seen over the past two years.
[01:42:56.547 --> 01:43:00.510]  We'll be back to talk more about it on the Alex Jones Show live in fourwalls.com.
[01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:00.991]  Don't go away.
[01:43:02.392 --> 01:43:11.397]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:43:11.477 --> 01:43:19.581]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:43:19.881 --> 01:43:24.563]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:13.793]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[01:45:13.833 --> 01:45:14.794]  We're exposed to lead.
[01:45:14.834 --> 01:45:15.854]  We're exposed to mercury.
[01:45:15.894 --> 01:45:20.876]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[01:45:21.256 --> 01:45:26.277]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[01:45:26.377 --> 01:45:28.478]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[01:45:29.298 --> 01:45:30.678]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[01:45:30.798 --> 01:45:34.419]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[01:45:34.539 --> 01:45:39.520]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:45.342]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[01:45:45.742 --> 01:45:50.943]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[01:45:51.323 --> 01:45:52.263]  And over and over again.
[01:45:52.343 --> 01:45:59.225]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[01:45:59.446 --> 01:46:01.646]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[01:46:01.746 --> 01:46:03.287]  I mean, this is so massive.
[01:46:03.367 --> 01:46:16.671]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland.
[01:46:16.691 --> 01:46:17.351]  Fertility is key.
[01:46:17.891 --> 01:46:34.483]  Fertility, but all your glands are what really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract actually, the whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[01:46:34.883 --> 01:46:38.866]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[01:46:38.886 --> 01:46:44.330]  When you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying, all of a sudden it was like BOOM!
[01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:48.994]  For losing weight, all this energy, I guess the iodine was sucking garbage out.
[01:46:49.314 --> 01:46:53.738]  It's as important as vitamin C. You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[01:46:53.758 --> 01:46:54.839]  You've got to have water to live.

[01:47:05.948 --> 01:47:08.591]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.586 --> 01:47:20.988]  We are live!
[01:47:21.088 --> 01:47:29.515]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.157 --> 01:47:36.702]  We're going to go to the one and only Milo Yiannopoulos here in a minute.
[01:47:36.722 --> 01:47:41.767]  I just want to finish off on a couple of news headlines here in relation to what's happening in Europe.
[01:47:43.015 --> 01:47:47.377]  Of course, we had the story about the election hopeful Salvini.
[01:47:47.457 --> 01:47:51.580]  He is the leader of the Northern League centre-right party in Italy.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:52.600]  Looks like they're going to win.
[01:47:53.601 --> 01:47:57.383]  Looks like they're going to form a coalition with Berlusconi's party.
[01:47:57.903 --> 01:48:00.825]  He's promising to deport 500,000 migrants.
[01:48:00.865 --> 01:48:12.471]  We have activists in Germany getting up on stage at this Berlin film festival, being shouted down, being called Nazis for drawing attention to the violent crime, to the sexual harassment now rampant in that country.
[01:48:13.251 --> 01:48:21.117]  Now in Sweden, my favourite country of all, we have Sweden lorry attacker who killed shoppers wanted to build a caliphate.
[01:48:21.644 --> 01:48:28.387]  An asylum seeker who drove a lorry through crowds of shoppers in Stockholm, killing five people, has said he wanted to build a caliphate.
[01:48:28.427 --> 01:48:30.848]  And I guess Sweden would have been the perfect place to do that.
[01:48:31.428 --> 01:48:43.493]  It's funny that there are rumours that the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, is actually hiding out in Sweden, given that it would tend to be sympathetic to his cause if you read the regular stories coming out of that country.
[01:48:43.933 --> 01:48:49.996]  But Rakhman Akhilov, who was a terrorist that ran down and killed these people in the centre of Stockholm,
[01:48:50.857 --> 01:48:54.778]  Stole the beer lorry and swerved wildly through the Swedish capital city centre.
[01:48:55.098 --> 01:48:57.438]  We all remember that horrible story from April last year.
[01:48:57.718 --> 01:49:06.000]  Well now he's told a court that he wanted Sweden to end its participation in the fight against the caliphate, to stop sending its soldiers to war zones.
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:08.321]  So he's trying to justify the attack.
[01:49:08.801 --> 01:49:14.642]  But again, literally saying that he wanted to quote, build a caliphate according to Prophet Muhammad's prophecies.
[01:49:15.362 --> 01:49:19.143]  And he thought he could do that by literally tearing apart little girls in the street.
[01:49:19.887 --> 01:49:23.970]  Meanwhile, returning ISIS jihadists are coming back into Sweden.
[01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:30.914]  They're rolling out the red carpet, giving them benefits, giving them housing, even though there's a massive housing shortage in Sweden.
[01:49:31.615 --> 01:49:37.719]  And now this, the Council of Europe slams Crimewave Sweden for not taking more migrants.
[01:49:38.439 --> 01:49:39.640]  This is Breitbart.com.
[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.580]  They're not doing enough.
[01:49:41.021 --> 01:49:44.483]  They're literally obliterating themselves, ruining their culture.
[01:49:44.823 --> 01:49:45.904]  They hired a head.
[01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:48.371]  This is my favourite story and a long one.
[01:49:48.692 --> 01:50:06.305]  They hired as the head of their cultural heritage board a guy who was a Muslim migrant who admitted he'd read nothing about Sweden's cultural heritage and in fact in other interviews showed that he wanted to destroy Sweden's cultural heritage because of course it was racist.
[01:50:06.325 --> 01:50:10.909]  So now the Council of Europe is calling on Sweden to import yet more migrants
[01:50:11.716 --> 01:50:17.697]  Even as we have these massive problems with mass sexual assault, terrorist attacks, but they're not doing enough.
[01:50:17.717 --> 01:50:28.719]  They're literally obliterating their own country, hiring people to head cultural heritage boards that hate the culture of Sweden, and even still, that is not enough.
[01:50:29.739 --> 01:50:36.060]  Absolutely incredible situation in Europe, but now we're joined by the one and only Milo Yiannopoulos there in studio.
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.601]  Milo, good to speak to you.
[01:50:37.721 --> 01:50:38.921]  Hello Pumpkin, how are you?
[01:50:42.316 --> 01:50:49.260]  Let's get into this whole, you know, the banner hang with the NRA, they're calling for killing Republicans.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:51:00.186]  We had the Facebook group last week where literally they were like, yeah, we need to get revenge by having more James T. Hodgkinsons, more crazed shooters, shooting Republicans, shooting conservatives.
[01:51:00.507 --> 01:51:06.230]  Have you ever seen a time where things are this divisive, this hysterical, this unhinged?
[01:51:07.009 --> 01:51:09.470]  No, and I don't think anybody has for many decades.
[01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:12.111]  But it's a good job that liberals are such terrible shots.
[01:51:12.892 --> 01:51:14.392]  Steve Scalise, of course, lived.
[01:51:15.093 --> 01:51:17.534]  If it had been a Republican shooting, he might not have done.
[01:51:18.374 --> 01:51:25.897]  It's interesting, you know, liberals on the one hand claim, you know, they're saying that they want a violent revolution, they're going to start getting guns, they're going to resist Trump.
[01:51:27.967 --> 01:51:28.888]  This is their undoing, really.
[01:51:28.908 --> 01:51:31.009]  I mean, on the one hand, they say they want a sort of violent revolution.
[01:51:31.029 --> 01:51:33.111]  At the same time, they're asking for gun control.
[01:51:33.551 --> 01:51:40.916]  The undoing of these liberal protesters is going to come down to their reliance on words over action.
[01:51:41.457 --> 01:51:44.339]  The left has been policing language so long and so effectively.
[01:51:44.659 --> 01:51:50.683]  The left has been controlling what we can all say as a way of controlling what we can all do for so long and with such great results.
[01:51:51.123 --> 01:51:54.185]  I think that they imagine words are now enough to beat us.
[01:51:55.046 --> 01:51:56.466]  Words are now enough to do the job.
[01:51:56.546 --> 01:51:57.106]  Well, they're not.
[01:51:57.726 --> 01:52:17.250]  You know, left-wingers seem to think they're going to be able to disarm 100 million Americans and Second Amendment supporters merely by saying so, or by putting some innocent-looking children who have been coached with Democrat Party talking points on television, instead of actually, you know, taking to the... If the left really wants a civil war, I think it's fairly obvious which way it's going to go pretty quickly.
[01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:21.511]  As far as the level of the fever pitch hysteria, there's nothing more disgusting.
[01:52:21.911 --> 01:52:23.331]  Literally nothing.
[01:52:24.181 --> 01:52:47.975]  More disgusting than people taking to the airways on the bodies, the still warm bodies of dead children, to advocate for policies that would not work, policies that would not stop this happening in the future, policies that would not stop any previous attack from happening, and which are really aimed, as everybody I think knows by now, as has been well established, at entrenching and enlarging and ameliorating the power of the state.
[01:52:48.875 --> 01:52:55.939]  And reducing the ability of private individuals to protect themselves against tyranny and to protect themselves against anything else and anybody else.
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:00.962]  I mean, it's the most underprivileged and vulnerable people of all who need firearms.
[01:53:01.022 --> 01:53:04.584]  It's the women walking through Detroit or Chicago or St.
[01:53:04.624 --> 01:53:11.008]  Louis suburbs who would be well served by having a pistol in their handbag and possibly prevented from being attacked and whatnot.
[01:53:11.088 --> 01:53:16.752]  It's gay people in Orlando nightclubs subjected to the horrors of imported Islamism.
[01:53:17.412 --> 01:53:25.694]  Who would do well to be carrying, if a couple of people had been strapped up in Pulse in Orlando, the death toll wouldn't have been 49, perhaps it would have been two.
[01:53:26.914 --> 01:53:33.716]  It is new and it is incredible, the level of divisive, you know, vitriol and hatred.
[01:53:33.736 --> 01:53:43.678]  I can tell you, you and I are both visitors, in my case literally and in your case professionally, to America and to the culture wars, to the extraordinary
[01:53:44.398 --> 01:53:46.100]  Melting pot of horrors over here.
[01:53:46.161 --> 01:53:59.098]  And I can't speak for you, but from my point of view as an impartial observer, you know, without skin in the game, I'm not a Republican, I'm not whatever, it seems to me unarguable that the
[01:54:01.897 --> 01:54:12.487]  The entire range and responsibility of the horrors that are going through society are the result of the progressive left provoking and starting it.
[01:54:12.807 --> 01:54:16.370]  Republicans, in my experience in this country on the whole, just want to be left alone.
[01:54:16.530 --> 01:54:17.932]  This is the land of liberty.
[01:54:17.972 --> 01:54:23.457]  This is where people can pursue their individual good in their own way, on their own ranch in Montana.
[01:54:24.057 --> 01:54:36.821]  Free from imposition and free from the prying eyes of government and the interfering of teachers, of lawyers, of all the other assorted professional classes of busybodies, nannies, scolds and school moms.
[01:54:38.161 --> 01:54:51.865]  Most Republicans and certainly most Libertarians just want to be left alone but the left just won't leave us and they continue to inject themselves into our private lives sociopathically in this case by advocating for more power for the state
[01:54:52.105 --> 01:55:06.116]  And less power for the people in the wake of a, well we shouldn't call it a tragedy really, an attack by a nutter in a school that had nothing to do with gun legislation and would not have been prevented had guns been, had the law been different in any way.
[01:55:06.736 --> 01:55:14.882]  You see the Washington Post thing, amazing thing the Washington Post published from a former writer of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Silver's left-wing data-driven blog.
[01:55:15.703 --> 01:55:16.884]  And she said, I looked at the evidence.
[01:55:17.424 --> 01:55:20.867]  I looked at the evidence and I've changed my mind.
[01:55:21.007 --> 01:55:37.879]  None of the gun control positions proposed by Democrat politicians, none of the things that the celebrities and the, you know, the Catholic, whatever, the Democrat politicians who hurl themselves onto Twitter to capitalize from these tragedies, none of the stuff they propose would have made a difference.
[01:55:38.706 --> 01:55:39.467]  None of it would have worked.
[01:55:40.007 --> 01:55:40.608]  So why are they doing it?
[01:55:40.628 --> 01:55:41.809]  Well, it's quite obvious why they're doing it, isn't it?
[01:55:41.829 --> 01:55:56.802]  They're doing it because enlarging and empowering the state and debilitating private citizens is in the left's best interests because when they control all of the organs and all of the institutions of civil society, they're best able to exercise control over the public.
[01:55:58.314 --> 01:56:05.424]  Which is why, Milo, they're now, this is CNN today, literally saying we should lower the voting age to 16 years old.
[01:56:05.444 --> 01:56:08.028]  I mean, I believed a lot of things when I was 16.
[01:56:08.589 --> 01:56:10.912]  Don't really believe any of them now.
[01:56:11.012 --> 01:56:11.894]  I was straight when I was 16.
[01:56:14.056 --> 01:56:20.800]  What did 16-year-old Milo believe, for example?
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:23.661]  I was a heterosexual centrist at 16.
[01:56:24.002 --> 01:56:24.462]  And why?
[01:56:24.822 --> 01:56:27.363]  Because my frontal lobes weren't fully formed yet.
[01:56:28.104 --> 01:56:29.985]  I wasn't actually a person yet.
[01:56:30.465 --> 01:56:40.453]  I was 16 years old and I was being buffeted around by forces beyond my control and by authorities I hadn't yet considered whether or not I should question.
[01:56:40.694 --> 01:56:44.036]  Parents, teachers, social pressure from the playground.
[01:56:44.057 --> 01:56:46.118]  I mean, just look, I interviewed somebody on my show the other day.
[01:56:46.559 --> 01:56:55.986]  It was a young girl who was in her mid-teens who was being told by her teachers, she grew up in UC Berkeley, in Berkeley of all places, Berkeley, California, and she was being told by her teachers that questioning
[01:56:56.747 --> 01:57:02.853]  Their authority, questioning what she was told in class, represented a violation of the school's honor code.
[01:57:03.193 --> 01:57:05.455]  These are the kinds of pressures that you have on you when you're 16.
[01:57:05.635 --> 01:57:09.879]  You're not even, you know, you're not even fully sexually developed at 16.
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:16.385]  You're not capable of doing anything at 16, particularly not making decisions about the future.
[01:57:17.745 --> 01:57:18.486]  We all know why.
[01:57:19.067 --> 01:57:24.657]  Because people start left-wing, and when they get responsibilities, they get families, they get mortgages and all the rest of it, they move to the right.
[01:57:24.677 --> 01:57:25.458]  Because of course they do.
[01:57:25.819 --> 01:57:27.281]  We all know why they want to lower the voting age.
[01:57:27.402 --> 01:57:28.023]  I would raise it to 30.
[01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:33.152]  All right, we'll be back with Milo after the break.
[01:57:33.172 --> 01:57:43.420]  I want to talk to Milo about Black Panther and the new Clint Eastwood movie, which isn't getting as much praise, shall we say, as Black Panther and the all-conquering Wakanda.
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.382]  We'll be back after the break on the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[01:57:47.402 --> 01:57:47.783]  Don't go away.

[01:58:59.276 --> 01:59:07.925]  You know, I found out they've got big publications going around trying to find people to lie and say that I don't believe what I say and that I don't like my audience.
[01:59:09.702 --> 01:59:11.143]  Again, don't believe what I say.
[01:59:11.223 --> 01:59:12.804]  We're building what we've talked about.
[01:59:12.844 --> 01:59:13.885]  We're turning it around.
[01:59:13.925 --> 01:59:14.805]  We're doing it.
[01:59:15.305 --> 01:59:16.846]  That's the proof of believing something.
[01:59:17.687 --> 01:59:19.728]  I'm 110% committed to this and you know it.
[01:59:20.148 --> 01:59:22.550]  And when you fund us, they can't stop us.
[01:59:23.090 --> 01:59:24.951]  We're starting to see the orders rolling in.
[01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:26.993]  People saying they're listening and watching on TV stations.
[01:59:27.113 --> 01:59:28.994]  So praise God, the cavalry's coming over.
[01:59:29.934 --> 01:59:39.119]  Uh, the Reds here, and so for all the censorship online, and the stuff they've done trying to destroy us, they're not suppressing the signal thanks to you out there.
[01:59:39.519 --> 01:59:43.201]  I want to thank God, I want to thank my family, I want to thank this crew, I want to thank the audience.
[01:59:43.861 --> 01:59:47.743]  Again, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:58.567 --> 02:00:17.482]  We're live and we are into the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.502 --> 02:00:21.585]  I'm joined by Milo Yiannopoulos who will be taking over the reins after this segment.
[02:00:21.605 --> 02:00:25.668]  But I wanted to get his take on Black Panther and the new Clint Eastwood movie.
[02:00:26.357 --> 02:00:29.839]  Which is not getting as much praise, let's just say.
[02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:40.127]  It is, of course, a movie about the attempted terrorist attack in Paris a couple of years ago, where the heroes who actually stopped the attack portray themselves in the film, including one guy who's African-American.
[02:00:40.367 --> 02:00:50.354]  So you've got an actual black hero who stopped a terrorist, stopped a massacre, getting absolutely no attention in comparison to the guy wearing a leotard in Black Panther.
[02:00:50.894 --> 02:00:54.861]  Milo, we've got Wakanda, which is basically an alt-right paradise, right?
[02:00:54.941 --> 02:00:56.523]  It is!
[02:00:56.543 --> 02:00:58.987]  It totally is!
[02:00:59.508 --> 02:01:03.114]  People aren't getting their expectations met when they go to see this film, I imagine, right?
[02:01:03.815 --> 02:01:09.499]  Well, of course I went to it with the precise expectation of seeing black men in spandex and I was not disappointed.
[02:01:10.059 --> 02:01:24.509]  I was, you know, look, obviously I'm never going to criticise a film with lots of sexy half-naked black men, but what was amazing about it was that the analysis that came from Breitbart, came from you, came from a writer at my own site, was precisely correct.
[02:01:24.769 --> 02:01:27.911]  The analysis of Black Panther was that Wakanda
[02:01:28.211 --> 02:01:35.553]  Which, you know, set aside the silliness of Africa having this, you know, glorious, glittering, superpower presence, were it only for the absence of colonialism.
[02:01:35.593 --> 02:01:36.213]  Yeah, yeah, it's funny.
[02:01:36.613 --> 02:01:40.615]  But set aside that, and look at the political dimensions of this country.
[02:01:40.715 --> 02:01:42.075]  Well, it's very clear, it's very obvious.
[02:01:42.115 --> 02:01:49.317]  This is a nationalist, protectionist, isolationist country, with a leader who speaks not entirely unlike Donald Trump.
[02:01:49.617 --> 02:01:54.519]  And much more obvious, and much more persuasive than that, is that Michael B. Jordan, villain, is a social justice warrior.
[02:01:56.299 --> 02:02:00.741]  Rain down hellfire on quote-unquote the oppressor, on the white people.
[02:02:01.061 --> 02:02:06.443]  It's very, very clear what the messaging is and I don't think you need to look too deeply or too hard to see it.
[02:02:06.483 --> 02:02:07.223]  It's all there for you.
[02:02:07.563 --> 02:02:20.868]  This was confounding and confusing to me watching it and I'd gone expecting to sort of enjoy it at a superficial, trivial level, you know, predictably, but have to sit through and grit my teeth, you know, through the social justice nonsense.
[02:02:21.368 --> 02:02:25.809]  But you know what, actually the message was completely confounding and the opposite of what we all expected.
[02:02:26.209 --> 02:02:35.011]  And the media, of course, is very, very upset that we have all noticed this, confused about our analysis, and is posting lots of pieces about InfoWars, Breitbart and Milo.
[02:02:35.292 --> 02:02:38.152]  You see all those stories about how, you know, Breitbart liked Black Panther.
[02:02:38.312 --> 02:02:39.293]  This is not okay!
[02:02:39.733 --> 02:02:44.934]  There were stories that MSN, you know, SF, The Wrap, all these, I think there were about
[02:02:44.974 --> 02:02:49.177]  About 50 stories, all told, with all of the aggregators and all the rest of it.
[02:02:49.377 --> 02:02:53.320]  About 50 stories about the fact that I published a positive review of Black Panther.
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:55.161]  They so wanted us to be racist.
[02:02:55.801 --> 02:03:04.027]  Well, I mean, Milo, they expected it to be a gimme, that we would all hate it, we would all be triggered by it, and it would be an easy win for them, but quite the opposite happened.
[02:03:04.207 --> 02:03:14.214]  But we did have this article I wanted to mention here out of the route, where they're literally calling, based off a scene in the movie from what they say, for black people to literally start barking at white people
[02:03:14.534 --> 02:03:15.995]  Oh, it's my favourite thing.
[02:03:16.215 --> 02:03:18.776]  Why do people who speak out of turn?
[02:03:18.856 --> 02:03:19.797]  I don't know if it was Bucky.
[02:03:19.857 --> 02:03:20.357]  It's a parody.
[02:03:20.377 --> 02:03:21.438]  It doesn't look like a parody.
[02:03:21.958 --> 02:03:40.248]  It's in the movie, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, I'm not spoiling any plot points by telling you that when the heroes in exile go to find a tribe who was previously cast aside or whatever, they go and they're searching for allies to build up their base before they launch an assault back on Wakanda.
[02:03:42.069 --> 02:03:53.918]  When they find these guys up north, they happen to have a sort of typical movie white guy who's a bumbling, awkward, terrified idiot, which is of course how we are portrayed in advertising and in the movies on TV these days.
[02:03:54.499 --> 02:03:58.342]  And he tries to pipe up and they do actually bark at him.
[02:03:58.382 --> 02:04:04.967]  It's something between... Well, I went to YouTube and I listened to... They described it as maybe like an ape-like grunt.
[02:04:05.407 --> 02:04:13.289]  Well, I went onto YouTube and listened to various animal sounds to try to pin down exactly what animal it is.
[02:04:13.789 --> 02:04:17.470]  And I'm still searching, so maybe in one of the breaks I'll keep trying and I'll see if I can work out what it is.
[02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:24.712]  But yes, I mean, it's sort of... I wonder whether this is one of those things where they're kind of like, we're going to put this in the movie to dare you to be racist about it.
[02:04:24.752 --> 02:04:28.633]  You know, so we're going to hand this to the lowest comment, because they think we actually are that racist.
[02:04:28.673 --> 02:04:34.514]  We think, you know, they're the ones who are making the comparisons between, you know, jungle beasts and people of particular skin colour.
[02:04:34.514 --> 02:04:36.555]  Okay, Milo is going to take over the reins in the next segment.
[02:04:36.575 --> 02:04:38.937]  I've been Paul Joseph Watson, breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:04:38.997 --> 02:04:39.877]  Don't go away, Milo will be back.
[02:05:03.602 --> 02:05:05.043]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:05:05.204 --> 02:05:07.606]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your chemistry.
[02:05:07.786 --> 02:05:15.092]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[02:05:52.819 --> 02:05:53.940]  That means it's clean.

[02:06:11.932 --> 02:06:16.035]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:16.295 --> 02:06:17.936]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.296 --> 02:06:21.959]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:26.753 --> 02:06:28.014]  Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[02:06:28.074 --> 02:06:30.456]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:30.596 --> 02:06:34.399]  My name is Milo, and I am standing in for Alex for the next two hours.
[02:06:34.499 --> 02:06:43.485]  Coming up on the show, we have Laura Loomer, the intrepid reporter who is down there in Florida, figuring out what's happening and working out what the media is trying to do.
[02:06:44.571 --> 02:06:57.345]  With what we are obliged to call a senseless tragedy, but which is in fact, of course, the actions of a nutcase, as we know, would not have been prevented or ameliorated by more gun control laws.
[02:06:57.365 --> 02:07:01.770]  But Laura's going to talk to us about what the politicians, and in particular, what CNN is up to down there.
[02:07:02.831 --> 02:07:06.614]  Also coming up in the show we have Phil Labonte who is a rock metal icon.
[02:07:06.654 --> 02:07:08.836]  He's the lead singer of All That Remains.
[02:07:09.076 --> 02:07:22.706]  He has been called an apologist for the murder of children because he came out in support of the Second Amendment despite the emotional arguments from the media, everywhere in the media, following the horrible events.
[02:07:23.547 --> 02:07:24.168]  In Florida.
[02:07:24.248 --> 02:07:26.612]  Something of a somber tone in the streets of Florida.
[02:07:26.652 --> 02:07:27.573]  I live in Miami, in fact.
[02:07:27.613 --> 02:07:29.456]  Not very far from where this happened.
[02:07:29.556 --> 02:07:33.422]  And it has been a miserable time to be out in South Florida.
[02:07:33.462 --> 02:07:38.009]  Sort of unusually somber tone on the streets even of Miami.
[02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:39.171]  So...
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:41.440]  What's going on down there?
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:45.602]  Well, before we get into Florida, I have some news related to, well, myself.
[02:07:46.163 --> 02:07:50.645]  And that is a Simon & Schuster lawsuit, which today I've announced that I am letting go.
[02:07:51.085 --> 02:08:07.152]  Some of you will remember, Alex is kind enough to bring it up when I'm on the show from time to time, that my book, Dangerous, which was a New York Times bestseller and sold, was a New York Times bestseller for five weeks, sold hundreds of thousands of copies, made a lot of money, was dropped by Simon & Schuster.
[02:08:07.232 --> 02:08:08.513]  I believe that they picked up the book,
[02:08:09.233 --> 02:08:18.416]  Having no intention of publishing it ever, and probably planning to force me to quit because, you know, that mocked up manuscript that hit the internet.
[02:08:18.756 --> 02:08:21.037]  You saw all those edits that they tried to embarrass me with.
[02:08:21.077 --> 02:08:22.257]  Well, there was a reason they did all that.
[02:08:22.337 --> 02:08:24.378]  Anyway, today we've announced that we've dropped the lawsuit.
[02:08:24.418 --> 02:08:24.618]  Why?
[02:08:25.078 --> 02:08:26.858]  Because the book did so well.
[02:08:27.619 --> 02:08:29.579]  And this is the good news story about all of it.
[02:08:30.139 --> 02:08:37.702]  When you sue somebody for damages, you have to establish that they cost you some money, or maybe that they cost you some, they did you some reputational damage.
[02:08:38.562 --> 02:08:55.143]  But my book sold so well because people are so extraordinarily frustrated with the excesses of the progressive left on college campuses, in the media, in the entertainment industry, and so fascinated by my story that we realized it was going to be a hard slog establishing damages.
[02:08:55.203 --> 02:08:56.665]  As anyone who's been through a lawsuit knows,
[02:08:57.898 --> 02:09:00.620]  Getting a damages expert in can cost half a million dollars upwards.
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:17.630]  So instead we've decided to spend the money and spend the time focusing on releasing new books by freedom lovers, libertarians, conservatives, anyone who cannot get a fair hearing from the traditional liberal journalists and media establishment in New York.
[02:09:17.770 --> 02:09:21.613]  Simon Shoes is a statement that I've given to the press today so you can go find it.
[02:09:22.273 --> 02:09:23.374]  Pretty much everyone's reporting on it.
[02:09:23.394 --> 02:09:25.395]  Of course they're all crowing about me dropping the lawsuit.
[02:09:25.675 --> 02:09:26.576]  Failing to understand.
[02:09:27.256 --> 02:09:37.290]  But what I have established with this lawsuit, which Alex does on the air every day, on his show, and I'm attempting to do in live events and in publishing, is that we don't need them anymore.
[02:09:37.551 --> 02:09:39.253]  We don't need the progressive media anymore.
[02:09:39.293 --> 02:09:40.875]  We don't need the big
[02:09:41.886 --> 02:09:49.330]  Liberal bear moths to get our message out, and not just in small ways, not petty fringe acts of resistance.
[02:09:49.690 --> 02:09:52.951]  We don't need them anymore to become New York Times bestsellers.
[02:09:53.292 --> 02:09:57.874]  We don't need them anymore to have massive shows listened to by millions of people.
[02:09:57.914 --> 02:10:06.378]  And Simon & Schuster has demonstrated that when you behave badly and you treat not just authors but their readers like pieces of you-know-what,
[02:10:07.864 --> 02:10:11.628]  The conservatives and libertarians and freedom lovers everywhere can just go out and do it on their own.
[02:10:12.289 --> 02:10:12.929]  Alex has done it.
[02:10:13.290 --> 02:10:13.750]  I've done it.
[02:10:14.291 --> 02:10:17.254]  We both encourage you to do the same thing.
[02:10:17.274 --> 02:10:21.679]  So I'm going to be focusing on dangerous books, which is my new book imprint.
[02:10:22.912 --> 02:10:23.733]  And it's all very good news.
[02:10:24.453 --> 02:10:30.577]  Another bit of news related to me, and then we can get on to the actual news, because people do like me to give them a little update, a little Milo update.
[02:10:31.137 --> 02:10:35.880]  Phoenix, I have a show in Phoenix, and here's what Antifa has been up to in Phoenix.
[02:10:36.801 --> 02:10:45.166]  The promoter for the Phoenix tour, I'm reading from notes that I just got sent by my booking agent, the promoter from Phoenix made the mistake of putting his logo
[02:10:46.187 --> 02:10:49.390]  On a poster for my speech, which is due on Friday.
[02:10:50.431 --> 02:10:56.657]  Intimidating men then rang his home doorbell and started threatening his girlfriend.
[02:10:57.417 --> 02:10:58.919]  His girlfriend is now terrified.
[02:10:59.219 --> 02:11:03.122]  They phoned every venue that he has ever worked with.
[02:11:03.843 --> 02:11:19.653]  In the past or works with currently and Antifa has been tweeting him every 10 minutes all day every day with threats of physical violence and death threats against him and anybody that comes to his shows with the result that one venues already cancelled their relationship with him.
[02:11:20.613 --> 02:11:21.234]  Antifa has
[02:11:23.456 --> 02:11:28.300]  has threatened to take this guy's livelihood away for the crime of hosting me.
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:29.961]  Well, the show, I'm sure, will go on.
[02:11:29.981 --> 02:11:31.522]  We're working it out right now.
[02:11:31.822 --> 02:11:38.187]  Now, onto the news, and Florida... Well, what are the reasons for this shooting?
[02:11:39.485 --> 02:11:43.606]  What moved a young guy to open fire and kill 17 people?
[02:11:44.607 --> 02:11:51.429]  We may never know what's in this guy's head, but we can make some observations, I think, about the prevailing culture.
[02:11:52.170 --> 02:11:55.391]  I think we can make some observations about what's been happening to America.
[02:11:56.431 --> 02:12:00.595]  In the last couple of decades, which might be leading young boys to act out.
[02:12:00.635 --> 02:12:16.329]  Now the first thing to say about Florida, South Florida, and in particular Broward County, where this happened, is that they had a new initiative aimed at school safety, but rooted in social justice, that was instituted a little while ago, August of 2017.
[02:12:16.489 --> 02:12:18.410]  They brought in a new initiative
[02:12:23.942 --> 02:12:26.163]  It was called the Broward County Solution.
[02:12:26.483 --> 02:12:39.249]  And the Broward County Solution was designed, get this, to reduce the statistical disparity between black and Hispanic arrests versus white and Asian arrests.
[02:12:39.289 --> 02:12:52.855]  And of course this young guy, whose name contained Jesus and Cruz, this Nicholas with a K, would have fallen under the Hispanic definition of this new policy from Broward County Schools.
[02:12:53.962 --> 02:13:04.746]  A Denver organization called Padres e Jovenes Unidas successfully advocated for a program like Broward's to achieve racial and educational equity in Denver schools.
[02:13:05.366 --> 02:13:23.432]  This policy designed to, in other words, turn a blind eye to minor infractions from students of color, students from so-called marginalized communities, and to punish more harshly the wrongdoing of white students and Asian students because there's a disparity in the statistics.
[02:13:26.323 --> 02:13:33.007]  It's never occurred to anybody that it might be a good idea to fix the reason that there is a disparity in the crimes committed.
[02:13:33.108 --> 02:13:33.268]  No.
[02:13:33.828 --> 02:13:37.390]  This was a superficial fix, which is exactly what social justice does.
[02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:39.172]  It's exactly what social justice is.
[02:13:40.072 --> 02:13:43.955]  Entirely predictable that they would treat the symptoms and leave the disease rostered
[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:45.120]  Rostering?
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:46.081]  Rostering's not a word.
[02:13:46.541 --> 02:13:49.242]  Leave the disease rotting and festering.
[02:13:49.482 --> 02:13:50.342]  That's what I was going for.
[02:13:50.482 --> 02:13:53.983]  Crews, of course, had been suspended from Stoneman Douglas High.
[02:13:54.363 --> 02:13:57.024]  Not just for fighting, but for being caught with bullets.
[02:13:58.065 --> 02:14:02.286]  Now to say nothing of the FBI's utter incompetence.
[02:14:02.306 --> 02:14:10.269]  And we're going to speak to Laura Loomer in the second hour that I'm on today about whether there's any incentive that the FBI might conceivably have
[02:14:11.949 --> 02:14:16.534]  For not pulling these people in and for allowing these crimes kind of tacitly to happen.
[02:14:17.916 --> 02:14:27.848]  Aside from the FBI's incompetence, if Broward County did not have this policy, is it conceivable that this young guy Cruz might have been removed from schools and might have been
[02:14:29.150 --> 02:14:29.711]  We're good to go.
[02:14:47.591 --> 02:14:55.194]  If we stop holding boys to female behavior standards, stop feminizing our playgrounds, stop throwing them all on antidepressant drugs.
[02:14:55.434 --> 02:15:00.577]  Dylann Roof, of course, being the best example of a young boy thrown on drugs.
[02:15:01.957 --> 02:15:05.939]  Maybe we wouldn't have these outbursts of so-called toxic masculinity.
[02:15:06.119 --> 02:15:17.004]  Masculinity is not toxic, but it can become dangerous if it is suppressed and abused by an increasingly feminized educational establishment.
[02:15:18.072 --> 02:15:20.597]  Masculinity is great.
[02:15:21.519 --> 02:15:23.002]  It's what got us to the stars.
[02:15:23.062 --> 02:15:24.224]  It's what built the internet.
[02:15:24.284 --> 02:15:29.915]  That testosterone-fueled desire to make women happy and to impress fellow men.
[02:15:31.544 --> 02:15:47.278]  But it can go bad when it's suppressed, and you gotta bear in mind a lot of... In fact, I think every one of these school shooters, these young white school shooters, was on antidepressant drugs, for which we don't necessarily have a clear idea of the consequences.
[02:15:47.399 --> 02:15:52.623]  After the break, we're going to talk about a change in American culture, away from so-called bourgeois culture.
[02:15:53.224 --> 02:15:53.825]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:54.145 --> 02:15:55.006]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:55.026 --> 02:15:56.247]  Marlee Anopoulos, standing in.
[02:16:02.694 --> 02:16:04.394]  Joel Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[02:16:04.534 --> 02:16:09.096]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:09.856 --> 02:16:11.556]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[02:16:11.596 --> 02:16:14.017]  Directed by the amazing director, Joel Gilbert.
[02:16:14.057 --> 02:16:14.917]  Here is the trailer.
[02:16:15.377 --> 02:16:19.558]  Call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[02:16:20.499 --> 02:16:22.779]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:16:23.579 --> 02:16:25.300]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:25.880]  Who cares?
[02:16:29.525 --> 02:16:30.525]  You haven't been called.
[02:16:32.406 --> 02:16:33.466]  Go back to Univision.
[02:16:33.646 --> 02:16:36.207]  I think Jeff is a nice person.
[02:16:36.247 --> 02:16:37.108]  He's very low energy.
[02:16:37.208 --> 02:16:39.788]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[02:16:40.929 --> 02:16:42.389]  Throw him out.
[02:16:42.649 --> 02:16:43.750]  Throw him out into the cold.
[02:16:44.050 --> 02:16:48.691]  Don't give him their coat.
[02:16:48.831 --> 02:16:50.032]  No coats.
[02:16:50.072 --> 02:16:51.812]  L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[02:16:52.073 --> 02:16:52.453]  Lying dead.
[02:16:57.345 --> 02:17:01.369]  I've never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[02:17:03.531 --> 02:17:04.972]  The most dishonest human beings.
[02:17:04.992 --> 02:17:05.893]  These people right here.
[02:17:06.013 --> 02:17:11.058]  Look at all the cameras.
[02:17:11.078 --> 02:17:11.779]  So disgusting.
[02:17:11.799 --> 02:17:14.041]  He's socialist slash communist.
[02:17:14.061 --> 02:17:14.601]  Crazy bird.
[02:17:14.621 --> 02:17:15.622]  He's crazy as a midwife.
[02:17:15.682 --> 02:17:18.845]  Pocahontas?
[02:17:18.865 --> 02:17:19.726]  The Indian?
[02:17:19.926 --> 02:17:20.867]  Very offensive.
[02:17:20.927 --> 02:17:21.728]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:17:22.068 --> 02:17:22.889]  A Pocahontas?
[02:17:24.983 --> 02:17:25.904]  Crooked Hillary!
[02:17:25.984 --> 02:17:27.165]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[02:17:27.185 --> 02:17:29.227]  She's been crooked from the beginning.
[02:17:29.247 --> 02:17:34.853]  Crooked Hillary!
[02:17:34.893 --> 02:17:37.415]  Politicians are really dishonest.
[02:17:37.796 --> 02:17:42.360]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:45.584]  This had nothing to do with me, except I might have pointed it out.
[02:17:47.717 --> 02:17:49.839]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[02:17:50.019 --> 02:17:51.840]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:53.221]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[02:17:53.902 --> 02:17:55.443]  Because they were protecting him.
[02:17:55.563 --> 02:17:56.483]  I'm trying to be nice.
[02:17:56.503 --> 02:17:58.004]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[02:17:59.305 --> 02:18:00.907]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[02:18:01.127 --> 02:18:02.928]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[02:18:02.968 --> 02:18:04.129]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[02:18:05.888 --> 02:18:08.309]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[02:18:08.449 --> 02:18:09.170]  It just doesn't work.
[02:18:09.210 --> 02:18:11.351]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[02:18:11.471 --> 02:18:14.312]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[02:18:14.352 --> 02:18:17.154]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[02:18:18.294 --> 02:18:19.915]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[02:18:19.955 --> 02:18:23.677]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[02:18:23.957 --> 02:18:24.897]  Repeat after me.
[02:18:24.917 --> 02:18:27.739]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[02:18:27.799 --> 02:18:29.299]  That's not going to happen.
[02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:30.520]  So help me God.
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:32.161]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[02:18:38.263 --> 02:18:41.289]  We will make America great again!
[02:18:42.532 --> 02:18:43.554]  Go home to mommy.
[02:18:43.914 --> 02:18:45.137]  They're gonna tuck you in bed.
[02:18:45.417 --> 02:18:46.980]  And your mother is voting for Trump?
[02:18:48.294 --> 02:18:49.575]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[02:18:49.595 --> 02:18:50.336]  We've carried them all.
[02:18:50.636 --> 02:18:51.256]  We sell them all.
[02:18:51.276 --> 02:18:52.017]  They're all groundbreaking.
[02:18:52.037 --> 02:18:53.819]  But this one, this one is fun.
[02:18:54.479 --> 02:18:55.740]  And very, very celebratory.
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.322]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[02:18:58.342 --> 02:18:59.163]  It's really a special film.
[02:19:00.264 --> 02:19:00.744]  Thanks a lot.
[02:19:00.764 --> 02:19:05.588]  Look, I urge everyone, you gotta get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[02:19:06.369 --> 02:19:09.051]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[02:19:09.692 --> 02:19:12.394]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[02:19:12.954 --> 02:19:25.458]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[02:19:25.758 --> 02:19:28.919]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[02:19:28.959 --> 02:19:29.939]  That's why it stuck.
[02:19:30.159 --> 02:19:35.161]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[02:19:35.321 --> 02:19:36.261]  I thought I knew Trump.
[02:19:36.361 --> 02:19:37.182]  I studied Trump.
[02:19:37.622 --> 02:19:38.342]  I thought I knew him.
[02:19:38.862 --> 02:19:41.663]  Only when you see this all back to back, how he reacts.
[02:19:42.243 --> 02:19:43.404]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:17.141]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[02:20:17.341 --> 02:20:20.902]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[02:20:23.042 --> 02:20:29.064]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[02:20:29.084 --> 02:20:32.125]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[02:20:32.185 --> 02:20:35.466]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[02:20:36.366 --> 02:20:38.987]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[02:20:40.047 --> 02:20:41.367]  Hello, hello, hello.
[02:20:41.387 --> 02:20:41.847]  Welcome back.
[02:20:41.927 --> 02:20:43.408]  I'm Marlionopoulos filling in
[02:20:44.693 --> 02:20:48.495]  For Alex Jones, I'm in my CPAC outfit, by the way.
[02:20:48.715 --> 02:20:49.735]  It's CPAC this week.
[02:20:49.875 --> 02:20:56.578]  I'll be headlining a party with Mike Cernovich, Stefan Molyneux, a couple of other people in Washington, D.C.
[02:20:57.419 --> 02:21:01.741]  I'm dressed in my young Republican loser outfit today for you.
[02:21:02.441 --> 02:21:03.241]  Little bow tie.
[02:21:03.562 --> 02:21:04.122]  It's wonderful.
[02:21:05.694 --> 02:21:09.496]  And we're talking about what happened in Florida.
[02:21:09.996 --> 02:21:18.121]  And I'll take a moment before we move back on to that serious subject, by the way, to thank the producers for this lovely pink and purple-washed background.
[02:21:18.161 --> 02:21:19.022]  I think they're heckling me.
[02:21:19.922 --> 02:21:24.105]  Yes, it is Info Wars, the Alex Jones Show, but slightly gayer than you know it.
[02:21:25.245 --> 02:21:34.491]  Now, what happened in Florida was the result of a broken and damaged young man.
[02:21:35.694 --> 02:21:49.402]  But these things don't happen in isolation, and if it's true that they're happening with increasing frequency and regularity, if Dylan Roof and Mr. Cruz are just the first in a new wave of this, it bears examination.
[02:21:50.102 --> 02:21:59.548]  It's worth us considering why it might be, and it's worth us considering whether there's anything over the last 30 years that might have left boys in such a terrible state.
[02:21:59.588 --> 02:22:02.650]  Now the left is going to tell you that toxic masculinity
[02:22:03.957 --> 02:22:08.020]  is in large part responsible for the acts of people like Dylan Roof and young Mr. Cruz.
[02:22:09.161 --> 02:22:26.134]  They're going to tell you that runaway male characteristics, violence, the instinct to cause death, to spread suffering, to inflict oneself on others, are responsible for this outburst.
[02:22:26.174 --> 02:22:31.519]  And they're going to tell you that the ready availability of guns is enabling
[02:22:32.719 --> 02:22:32.939]  That.
[02:22:33.940 --> 02:22:42.325]  But for quite some time, a brand of dissident feminist scholars has been suggesting that what we have is not too much masculinity, but in fact too little.
[02:22:43.185 --> 02:22:48.288]  In culture, men are regularly perceived as idiots, as dunderheads, blundering buffoons.
[02:22:49.349 --> 02:22:53.572]  Chris Pratt's character in Parks and Recreation isn't just an amusing
[02:22:54.292 --> 02:23:05.875]  It was not a new way of looking at a weak man in relationships with strong women, but it was in fact something of a herald for the way that culture was going to consider and treat men since.
[02:23:06.755 --> 02:23:09.876]  And this has been going on since before the beginning of Parks and Recreation.
[02:23:11.357 --> 02:23:16.438]  Now, scholars like Helen Smith and Christina Hoff Summers have published books on the subject.
[02:23:17.038 --> 02:23:21.840]  Men on Strike by Helen Smith and The War Against Boys by Christina Hoff Summers.
[02:23:24.087 --> 02:23:31.831]  With the question of boys, natural boisterousness and energy, huge, hugely excessive energy levels, we all remember being there.
[02:23:32.832 --> 02:23:41.577]  Being not just tempered, but suffocated by an increasingly feminized society, and in particular, increasingly feminized education.
[02:23:42.952 --> 02:23:51.718]  And one of the results of that, of course, one of the results of constantly judging boys by the standards, usually, yes, there he is, there's Chris Pratt.
[02:23:51.778 --> 02:24:02.986]  Actually, by the way, Chris, I don't want to say anything too mean about Chris Pratt because I have a reasonably strong suspicion that he's one of the only proper freedom-loving, gun-toting Republicans in Hollywood.
[02:24:03.006 --> 02:24:04.107]  I just wish he would say so.
[02:24:04.127 --> 02:24:05.528]  I'm pretty sure he voted for Trump.
[02:24:08.271 --> 02:24:18.839]  What they'll tell you is that an excess of boyness, of masculinity, of dude-ness, an outbreak of manhood is responsible for this violence.
[02:24:18.859 --> 02:24:31.769]  But actually, it's manhood being suppressed and suffocated and then exploding out in unexpected and devastating ways, according to a new breed of dissident feminists, and according to me.
[02:24:33.330 --> 02:24:36.853]  What they say is that men are being treated by being judged.
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:44.804]  by female behavior standards and when they don't meet them they're either being punished or they're being drugged.
[02:24:45.465 --> 02:24:48.207]  Now most people know about the Adderall crisis.
[02:24:49.127 --> 02:24:56.692]  I wrote a column in 2015 as long ago as that for Breitbart saying to stop mass killers we have to stop drugging our young boys.
[02:24:57.372 --> 02:25:05.498]  A dependence on prescription drugs to control the behavior of young boys so they don't get out of hand, so they're not loud in class, so they don't
[02:25:06.226 --> 02:25:07.727]  Have fistfights in the playground.
[02:25:07.827 --> 02:25:13.911]  All the stuff that boys need to do when they're growing, when they're getting the energy out of their systems.
[02:25:15.932 --> 02:25:22.816]  All of this is tempered down by an extraordinary explosion in the prescription drug, when it's an epidemic.
[02:25:23.277 --> 02:25:26.258]  Even Esquire magazine recognized it quite some time ago.
[02:25:26.879 --> 02:25:29.721]  Of drugs like Adderall being given
[02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:48.746]  To young boys to control their behavior because healthy behavior norms for young boys have become stigmatized by wider culture and have become anathema to the invariably female elementary and high school teachers who would much rather teach the well put together well behaved quiet young women.
[02:25:49.446 --> 02:25:54.610]  And don't want to have to deal with the much more messy, complex and difficult business of raising boys.
[02:25:54.891 --> 02:25:55.531]  So what do they do?
[02:25:56.112 --> 02:25:57.172]  They put them on drugs.
[02:25:58.033 --> 02:26:01.676]  Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza, Lexapro and Celexa.
[02:26:02.016 --> 02:26:06.160]  Red-headed Aurora killer James Holmes, Clonazepam and Sertraline.
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:09.883]  Virginia Tech mass murderer Sung Hoi Cho.
[02:26:10.424 --> 02:26:10.904]  Prozac.
[02:26:11.184 --> 02:26:13.146]  Charles Whitman, the Texas Tower sniper.
[02:26:13.426 --> 02:26:14.027]  Dexedrine.
[02:26:14.327 --> 02:26:18.091]  Columbine executioners Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
[02:26:18.391 --> 02:26:19.872]  Zoloft and Luvox.
[02:26:19.912 --> 02:26:23.976]  Those are the names of the most famous killers.
[02:26:24.937 --> 02:26:25.818]  Or at least some of them.
[02:26:27.611 --> 02:26:28.491]  In recent years.
[02:26:28.812 --> 02:26:31.513]  And they were all on these drugs.
[02:26:32.093 --> 02:26:33.093]  Dylann Roof was too.
[02:26:33.613 --> 02:26:36.655]  And so, it turns out, was young Mr. Cruz.
[02:26:36.715 --> 02:26:37.675]  Was young Nicholas Cruz.
[02:26:37.755 --> 02:26:44.698]  Millions of American men are prescribed powerful drugs after being diagnosed with a condition that is practically unknown outside of America.
[02:26:44.718 --> 02:26:45.698]  ADHD.
[02:26:46.339 --> 02:26:46.919]  ADD.
[02:26:47.319 --> 02:26:54.122]  Which in healthier cultures, in more normal cultures, would simply be male boisterousness.
[02:26:55.401 --> 02:26:58.964]  But in America, being a man has become pathologized.
[02:26:59.284 --> 02:27:04.548]  Being a man has become something to apologize for and take medication for.
[02:27:05.829 --> 02:27:09.652]  With this, I'm sorry to say, inevitable and tragic result.
[02:27:10.649 --> 02:27:15.072]  Now, there's a wider question here and it's a question of culture which I want to talk about briefly.
[02:27:15.092 --> 02:27:18.413]  There's a piece in philly.com which I found absolutely fascinating.
[02:27:18.473 --> 02:27:21.175]  It's so interesting and I urge you to go read the whole thing.
[02:27:21.615 --> 02:27:33.522]  What the writer in philly.com says is that this is part, if you take the 30,000 view, if you zoom out, this is part of a wider cultural context in which boys
[02:27:35.987 --> 02:27:46.978]  And the role of manhood in general is being written out of society and behavior codes that would traditionally have been adhered to by the bourgeoisie, by the middle classes, are being stigmatized in favor of free love.
[02:27:47.238 --> 02:27:48.059]  Now free love...
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:28:04.131]  The sexual revolution was a project of communism because, and singularly and especially, the reason they wanted everybody having sex with everybody is because it breaks down the most powerful engine of Western democratic capitalism, which is the nuclear family.
[02:28:04.752 --> 02:28:07.994]  And this piece at philly.com, which is really great, says that there have always been rebels.
[02:28:08.795 --> 02:28:14.197]  But even the deviants, back in the day, disavowed or openly disparaged the prevailing expectations.
[02:28:14.257 --> 02:28:18.059]  But the cultural script began to break down in the late 1950s.
[02:28:18.459 --> 02:28:26.322]  Adults with influence over the culture, for a variety of reasons, abandoned their role as advocates for respectability, civility and adult values.
[02:28:26.382 --> 02:28:28.623]  Because all cultures are not equal.
[02:28:28.983 --> 02:28:33.325]  And the culture that we like to think obtained in the good old days, in the 1950s,
[02:28:35.490 --> 02:28:36.870]  Didn't produce these killers.
[02:28:37.311 --> 02:28:39.851]  It didn't produce these troubled young men.
[02:28:40.251 --> 02:28:46.953]  And it all boils down, in many of the cases of the kids that I read who were on these drugs, equally to fatherlessness too.
[02:28:47.593 --> 02:28:48.334]  Absent fathers.
[02:28:48.394 --> 02:28:56.636]  These white families represent, if you don't mind me saying so, if it's not too rude, more like a ghetto family in the fatherlessness and absent parenting.
[02:28:57.336 --> 02:28:59.237]  And that's one clue as to how this stuff is happening.
[02:28:59.257 --> 02:28:59.737]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:02.757 --> 02:29:06.618]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:29:07.158 --> 02:29:14.560]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:29:15.261 --> 02:29:19.962]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:29:20.582 --> 02:29:22.483]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:29:23.103 --> 02:29:26.544]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:29:27.344 --> 02:29:29.805]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:29:30.485 --> 02:29:37.150]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:44.995]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:29:45.856 --> 02:29:52.500]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:54.161]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:29:54.521 --> 02:29:56.343]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[02:32:09.137 --> 02:32:17.807]  You know, I found out they've got big publications going around trying to find people to lie and say that I don't believe what I say and that I don't like my audience.
[02:32:17.867 --> 02:32:18.008]  What?
[02:32:19.562 --> 02:32:21.023]  Again, don't believe what I say.
[02:32:21.083 --> 02:32:22.663]  We're building what we've talked about.
[02:32:22.703 --> 02:32:23.744]  We're turning it around.
[02:32:23.784 --> 02:32:24.644]  We're doing it.
[02:32:25.164 --> 02:32:26.705]  That's the proof of believing something.
[02:32:27.545 --> 02:32:29.586]  I'm 110% committed to this and you know it.
[02:32:30.006 --> 02:32:32.427]  And when you fund us, they can't stop us.
[02:32:32.947 --> 02:32:34.807]  We're starting to see the orders rolling in.
[02:32:34.827 --> 02:32:36.848]  People saying they're listening and watching on TV stations.
[02:32:36.968 --> 02:32:38.849]  So praise God, the cavalry's coming over.
[02:32:39.789 --> 02:32:40.610]  Uh, the Reds here.
[02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:48.976]  And so for all the censorship online, and the stuff they've done trying to destroy us, they're not suppressing the signal thanks to you out there.
[02:32:48.996 --> 02:32:53.059]  I want to thank God, I want to thank my family, I want to thank this crew, I want to thank the audience.
[02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:57.603]  Again, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:33:06.303 --> 02:33:09.025]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.313 --> 02:33:19.014]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.615 --> 02:33:24.519]  Just a good old boy, never meanin' no harm.
[02:33:27.302 --> 02:33:31.866]  It's all you never saw, been in trouble with the law since the day they was born.
[02:33:33.783 --> 02:33:34.684]  Welcome back.
[02:33:35.124 --> 02:33:43.130]  I am Milo standing in for Alex Jones in this slightly gayer edition of Infowars and the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:49.455]  I'll be joined shortly by the most handsome man in music, at least I think so, than anyone following his Instagram account.
[02:33:49.755 --> 02:33:53.678]  Ladies out there with the fondness for metal and rock.
[02:33:54.758 --> 02:33:58.099]  Go check out his Instagram, we'll come to him in a second.
[02:33:58.239 --> 02:34:21.884]  Now, one of the most amusing aspects of, well it's sad too, but it is also funny, one of the most amusing aspects of the aftermath of any of these kinds of events is watching liberal celebrities and politicians clamor to virtue signal in public while proposing solutions that would do nothing to prevent this stuff in future and would only infringe on people's freedoms.
[02:34:21.944 --> 02:34:23.664]  Gun supporters really believe
[02:34:25.037 --> 02:34:36.336]  Second Amendment advocates honestly believe that their guns are there to protect them against tyranny and against assailants and criminals and whatnot, and you're not going to persuade them.
[02:34:37.233 --> 02:34:41.137]  With entreaties to the heart, because their entreaty comes from the heart too.
[02:34:41.657 --> 02:34:43.199]  It's about protecting their families.
[02:34:43.539 --> 02:34:45.260]  It's about protecting their civil liberties.
[02:34:45.841 --> 02:34:47.663]  So you're just fighting your emotions with theirs.
[02:34:47.683 --> 02:34:48.543]  It's not going to get you anywhere.
[02:34:48.564 --> 02:35:01.756]  But one of the most amusing new things, which I have not seen before, I've never seen this happen before, is the metal community and music in general, which typically appeals to men, heterosexual,
[02:35:03.228 --> 02:35:06.231]  Masculine, hyper-masculine, white men in many cases.
[02:35:06.931 --> 02:35:09.934]  This kind of music starting to buckle under pressure.
[02:35:10.495 --> 02:35:13.638]  And in particular, singers, maybe there's something about singers.
[02:35:14.318 --> 02:35:16.660]  Maybe they're upset they don't get to bash the drums or something.
[02:35:17.121 --> 02:35:17.982]  Something about singers.
[02:35:19.603 --> 02:35:28.992]  There seems to be a little outbreak in metal and in rock of singers who traditionally would have had much more sensible opinions about things like free speech and the Second Amendment.
[02:35:30.509 --> 02:35:31.890]  Coming out in support of gun control.
[02:35:32.410 --> 02:35:45.517]  Now, joining me is Phil Labonte from All That Remains, a band that I know that many InfoWars listeners, many Alex Jones fans are going to be huge, huge devotees to.
[02:35:46.257 --> 02:35:48.398]  Thank you so much for joining us and thank you for
[02:35:49.739 --> 02:35:57.044]  Well, for being on camera too, you can see there's rippling muscles under the shoes.
[02:35:57.064 --> 02:35:58.645]  Look at those traps, my goodness.
[02:35:58.886 --> 02:36:01.567]  Now if you find, is it PhilThatRemains on Instagram?
[02:36:02.228 --> 02:36:03.949]  If I were into white guys, my goodness.
[02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:11.615]  Now, you are a supporter of the Second Amendment, you are a supporter of many of the same values as the sort of populist
[02:36:12.675 --> 02:36:18.580]  Patriotic, freedom-loving America movement, you know, the people who voted for Donald Trump and all the rest of it.
[02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:33.512]  Now, you are not one of the singers, one of the members of the metal community who is advocating for gun control in light of this event, quite the opposite, and you're coming in for a bit of criticism as a result.
[02:36:33.552 --> 02:36:34.293]  What happened to you?
[02:36:36.034 --> 02:36:39.357]  No, I do not advocate for gun control.
[02:36:40.978 --> 02:36:41.939]  In light of the Florida
[02:36:43.224 --> 02:36:48.449]  Shooting, you know, a lot of people reacted emotionally, which is understandable.
[02:36:48.529 --> 02:36:57.736]  And there's a lot of people making calls for gun control, but they don't really elaborate what they're asking for.
[02:36:57.856 --> 02:37:09.166]  So I think that a lot of the breakdown between people that would be considered on my side and people that would be considered on the other side, a lot of the breakdown is trying to understand each other.
[02:37:09.679 --> 02:37:24.614]  So I made a short video that was trying to explain why after these shootings there isn't just an instant law passed that'll just fix the problem and that if there is a law passed, that law is going to come with problems.
[02:37:24.654 --> 02:37:32.201]  And so I put up the video and there is a metal blog that has had an issue with me for a long time because I just won't go away apparently.
[02:37:34.524 --> 02:37:43.888]  20 years of being in the same band and 10 years of these guys dogging me because I won't stop making music is basically the history of it.
[02:37:44.088 --> 02:37:54.053]  You mean to tell me that the inflamed objections of social justice warriors have not been enough to turn you off your lifelong passion and your career?
[02:37:54.553 --> 02:37:55.113]  Good heavens!
[02:37:55.774 --> 02:38:00.456]  There's me thinking you would crumble and fall over like a pack of jokers!
[02:38:01.136 --> 02:38:02.917]  You're an inspiring guy.
[02:38:04.177 --> 02:38:05.598]  Well, thank you.
[02:38:05.738 --> 02:38:07.919]  I call that, by the way, I call that the Ann Coulter thank you.
[02:38:07.939 --> 02:38:09.799]  Have you ever noticed when she's paid a compliment?
[02:38:10.139 --> 02:38:14.581]  You know, whenever she's paid a compliment on cable news, she'll say, thank you.
[02:38:15.121 --> 02:38:18.322]  I think we should all start doing it.
[02:38:18.342 --> 02:38:26.205]  Now listen, you posted a video trying to build bridges between the people who want all the guns taken away and the people who appreciate what they're for and what they're about.
[02:38:26.885 --> 02:38:27.685]  What do you get called?
[02:38:27.705 --> 02:38:29.986]  What do you get accused of as a result of this video?
[02:38:31.068 --> 02:38:34.252]  You know, I'm supporting the death of children.
[02:38:34.272 --> 02:38:47.525]  And wrongly, they said that it was about the NRA and stuff, which I mean, most of your viewers here would know that the NRA is a result of the
[02:38:48.704 --> 02:38:54.628]  The people that would vote for gun control, it's not a cause.
[02:38:55.548 --> 02:38:58.450]  The support for the Second Amendment isn't because of the NRA.
[02:38:58.490 --> 02:39:01.351]  The support for the Second Amendment created the NRA.
[02:39:01.371 --> 02:39:05.674]  So the NRA doesn't make people vote a certain way.
[02:39:05.734 --> 02:39:12.398]  It's that people vote this way and the NRA kind of jumps in and says, oh, we'll go ahead and give you a hand to spread your word.
[02:39:12.678 --> 02:39:15.760]  But the left hates the NRA because the NRA is one of the few
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:24.924]  Examples of a truly effective, rich, well-put-together, beautifully oiled, right-wing advocacy group.
[02:39:25.304 --> 02:39:27.585]  I mean, we don't have much like that.
[02:39:27.645 --> 02:39:28.585]  We have almost nothing.
[02:39:29.085 --> 02:39:33.487]  The ACLU, which is supposed to stand up for free speech and the First Amendment, has gone.
[02:39:34.087 --> 02:39:38.969]  All the organizations that nominally stand up for American freedoms have gone left.
[02:39:39.490 --> 02:39:42.131]  Conservatives have very few, if any other.
[02:39:42.851 --> 02:39:46.937]  Organizations, aside from the NRA, that stand up for their values.
[02:39:47.898 --> 02:39:49.661]  Totally, I completely agree with you.
[02:39:49.821 --> 02:39:56.811]  And this particular issue does go beyond the Second Amendment because it filters into the larger culture war, obviously.
[02:39:59.501 --> 02:40:06.264]  Notice some similarities with all media that you're familiar with from Gamergate, from your experience with Gamergate.
[02:40:06.544 --> 02:40:15.449]  And also you see it with the mainstream or legacy media, whatever you want to call them, and they kind of all use the same similar tactics.
[02:40:15.789 --> 02:40:19.531]  And that's exactly what this metal blog in particular did to me.
[02:40:19.571 --> 02:40:24.233]  They strawmanned the argument and then accused me of terrible things.
[02:40:25.073 --> 02:40:28.776]  And lied in the Facebook post about it.
[02:40:28.916 --> 02:40:38.764]  And it, to me, it was expected that I wouldn't get any kind of support from these kind of people with these perspective.
[02:40:38.784 --> 02:40:39.465]  I understand that.
[02:40:40.045 --> 02:40:49.013]  But when it was just libelous claims about me, when really all I was trying to do was help people to understand why it hasn't
[02:40:52.209 --> 02:40:58.571]  I was just trying to help people understand why there hasn't been an immediate law after one of these terrible shootings.
[02:40:58.871 --> 02:41:02.273]  And it's not because people are callous or don't care.
[02:41:02.313 --> 02:41:04.233]  It's because it's not as simple as that.
[02:41:04.553 --> 02:41:09.135]  And as soon as you start talking about passing laws, you do run into the Constitution.
[02:41:09.655 --> 02:41:12.576]  And so, like I said, it's beyond just the Second Amendment.
[02:41:12.616 --> 02:41:17.658]  Because if you're going to go ahead and pass laws that circumvent the Second Amendment, you're going to see these same people
[02:41:18.218 --> 02:41:18.858]  Looking to pass.
[02:41:18.878 --> 02:41:37.548]  Yeah, they're gonna come for the first we're gonna go to break in a minute But I just want to get you I'm gonna if you can stay with us for another 10 minutes We'll hold you over a little bit into the next segment Let me just get your reaction to there is a metal block called metal sucks No comment on whether that's connected to the rest of our interview and they have a manifesto they have a statement of purpose and
[02:41:38.028 --> 02:41:41.371]  And they say, we've never been an unbiased media outlet.
[02:41:41.431 --> 02:41:41.891]  Fair enough.
[02:41:42.452 --> 02:41:43.393]  Nor do we plan to become one.
[02:41:44.634 --> 02:41:46.996]  We believe in progressive values.
[02:41:47.096 --> 02:41:47.736]  Okay, fine.
[02:41:47.796 --> 02:41:49.658]  Websites coverage extends beyond Simply Metal.
[02:41:49.698 --> 02:41:54.642]  Well, that's because they have aspirations to be great cultural commentators.
[02:41:54.662 --> 02:41:56.683]  They're not happy with just talking about riffs anymore.
[02:41:57.424 --> 02:41:58.425]  Websites coverage extends.
[02:41:58.665 --> 02:42:00.907]  We believe in an artist's right to express political beliefs.
[02:42:01.147 --> 02:42:02.869]  Now hang on, here's where it starts to go wrong.
[02:42:03.229 --> 02:42:08.834]  We believe, says Metal Sucks, in an artist's and our right to express political beliefs through their work.
[02:42:10.526 --> 02:42:11.586]  I mean, they do sometimes.
[02:42:11.626 --> 02:42:19.868]  They do if it's presumably a communist or a feminist or somebody self-flagellating over white guilt.
[02:42:19.988 --> 02:42:22.169]  I imagine not a lot of that happens in the metal business.
[02:42:22.849 --> 02:42:26.029]  But what was amazing to me reading this was the comments underneath.
[02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:30.550]  The comments underneath from their own readers who are absolutely brutal.
[02:42:32.111 --> 02:42:33.411]  They say, silence his complicity.
[02:42:33.571 --> 02:42:35.371]  We are proud social justice warriors.
[02:42:35.671 --> 02:42:36.712]  We will not be bullied.
[02:42:36.932 --> 02:42:37.932]  Well, they are the bullies.
[02:42:38.092 --> 02:42:40.273]  And they are the people engaging in hate speech.
[02:42:40.293 --> 02:42:44.495]  We're going to talk a little bit about that, about the entertainment industry more generally, after the break.
[02:42:44.795 --> 02:42:47.336]  Phil Labonte from All That Remains.
[02:42:47.577 --> 02:42:52.699]  A rare example of somebody who is genuinely, actually successful and famous, who doesn't mind speaking out.
[02:42:53.019 --> 02:42:53.699]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:54.700]  Thanks so much.
[02:43:02.219 --> 02:43:04.159]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:04.179 --> 02:43:04.619]  Go ahead.
[02:43:04.899 --> 02:43:07.100]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:10.140]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:10.981 --> 02:43:12.101]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:12.421 --> 02:43:14.121]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:14.821 --> 02:43:16.902]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:17.142 --> 02:43:21.142]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:21.162 --> 02:43:23.643]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:24.463 --> 02:43:26.783]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:27.143 --> 02:43:28.264]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:28.504 --> 02:43:29.384]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:29.624 --> 02:43:30.644]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:31.104 --> 02:43:32.145]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:32.185 --> 02:43:33.246]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:43:33.266 --> 02:43:34.087]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:34.368 --> 02:43:39.733]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:40.054 --> 02:43:44.318]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:44.558 --> 02:43:47.441]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:47.702 --> 02:43:48.082]  You understand?
[02:43:48.162 --> 02:43:49.424]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:49.804 --> 02:43:50.925]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:51.906 --> 02:43:56.832]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:44:06.803 --> 02:44:07.824]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[02:44:08.044 --> 02:44:11.507]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[02:44:11.708 --> 02:44:13.129]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[02:44:13.149 --> 02:44:13.970]  They're suing me.
[02:44:14.210 --> 02:44:15.431]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[02:44:15.872 --> 02:44:17.673]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[02:44:17.713 --> 02:44:19.075]  We were bringing $5 million in a year.
[02:44:19.095 --> 02:44:20.336]  It cost a lot to run this.
[02:44:20.496 --> 02:44:22.378]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[02:44:22.618 --> 02:44:24.219]  I keep growing more as fast as I can.
[02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:27.342]  And as fast as I cut them off, I'm shooting out tentacles.
[02:44:27.643 --> 02:44:29.184]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[02:44:29.224 --> 02:44:29.805]  Tell him right there.
[02:44:29.825 --> 02:44:30.065]  Frank!
[02:44:30.345 --> 02:44:30.905]  Hey, Frank!
[02:44:31.165 --> 02:44:32.406]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[02:44:32.826 --> 02:44:36.508]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention.
[02:44:36.548 --> 02:44:38.029]  Although, of course, everybody likes a little bit of attention.
[02:44:38.069 --> 02:44:38.409]  It's nice.
[02:44:38.609 --> 02:44:48.914]  But I can't do TV, and I can't do radio, and I can't publish books, and I can't sell anything, and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... We're the heretics!
[02:44:49.034 --> 02:44:51.795]  Yeah, exactly, using every resource at their disposal.
[02:44:51.835 --> 02:44:53.056]  So it's not bragging.
[02:44:53.156 --> 02:44:55.697]  It's a daily reality, and that's why you've got to support things like InfoWars and...
[02:44:56.337 --> 02:44:58.520]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[02:44:58.540 --> 02:44:59.040]  We're doing it now.

[02:45:20.626 --> 02:45:24.891]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass, but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.

[02:46:05.652 --> 02:46:16.701]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[02:46:17.202 --> 02:46:18.083]  This is pollen blot.
[02:46:19.102 --> 02:46:31.374]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[02:46:31.835 --> 02:46:34.777]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[02:46:36.179 --> 02:46:40.203]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[02:46:40.663 --> 02:46:50.286]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[02:46:50.786 --> 02:46:53.627]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[02:46:58.108 --> 02:46:59.908]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:32.221]  Welcome back.
[02:47:58.994 --> 02:48:03.055]  It's me, everybody's favourite pocket homosexual.
[02:48:03.235 --> 02:48:07.537]  I'm an acceptable kind of gay because I like guns and the Bible.
[02:48:08.137 --> 02:48:18.100]  Right, we're talking to Phil from All That Remains about his experiences speaking out as a defender of the Second Amendment.
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:19.440]  And we're going to jump straight back into it.
[02:48:20.060 --> 02:48:21.341]  Phil, thank you for joining us.
[02:48:23.408 --> 02:48:29.150]  Various people, and let's be kind and not call them out, but various other, and it does seem to be singers, doesn't it?
[02:48:29.230 --> 02:48:33.591]  It's the front men, it's not the bass players, or the guitarists, or the drummers.
[02:48:33.611 --> 02:48:35.091]  There's something about you guys.
[02:48:35.351 --> 02:48:37.552]  And you know, singers are the divas of the band.
[02:48:37.572 --> 02:48:42.673]  You know, they've got you, and you're constantly posting pictures of, you know, lifting in the gym and all the rest of it.
[02:48:42.693 --> 02:48:45.094]  You're little, prim little divas.
[02:48:45.134 --> 02:48:46.654]  You're attention whores, aren't you?
[02:48:48.275 --> 02:48:52.456]  Anyway, the singers in metal are starting to feel the pressure, I guess.
[02:48:52.916 --> 02:48:54.939]  From journalists, from culture at large.
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:59.346]  And this happened to, let's say, rock journalism first.
[02:49:00.128 --> 02:49:04.454]  Rock journalism, you know, Playboy, Rolling Stone, went that way many decades ago.
[02:49:05.697 --> 02:49:07.857]  And now they're fully, you know, paid up in the tank, whatever.
[02:49:08.257 --> 02:49:10.958]  But singers themselves resisted until relatively recently.
[02:49:11.098 --> 02:49:26.581]  I was very disappointed by one of my idols, Marilyn Manson, who by any other ordinary metrics, you know, by any usual measurement, should have been at least a Trump sympathizer, or should have enjoyed the spectacle, enjoyed the horror and chaos, and should have hated social justice warriors.
[02:49:26.901 --> 02:49:31.902]  He did a silly video, and he said silly things, and these singers are going soft and bowing to pressure.
[02:49:32.222 --> 02:49:37.643]  Tell us, as somebody who is, you know, one of the princes of that kingdom, what is going on?
[02:49:38.043 --> 02:49:55.986]  Why are the heroes of, you know, regular Americans who support their rights to speak their mind and to, you know, shoot their guns, why are our heroes going soft and bending to pressure on, you know, what's effectively conspiracy theories, you know, gun control, that won't save a single life?
[02:49:56.386 --> 02:49:58.467]  What is happening to your colleagues?
[02:50:00.468 --> 02:50:00.848]  I don't know.
[02:50:00.868 --> 02:50:01.589]  I don't know.
[02:50:02.449 --> 02:50:03.950]  I can't speak for anyone else.
[02:50:04.130 --> 02:50:16.915]  I do understand that it's that there is a lot of pressure from the media from, you know, so there is a lot of social pressure to have the the correct opinions, the politically correct opinions.
[02:50:17.395 --> 02:50:28.639]  And when you're dealing with something like this particular shooting and guns in general, I think that it's it's hard to come up with an actual answer.
[02:50:28.659 --> 02:50:28.700]  So
[02:50:30.399 --> 02:50:41.510]  When you're kind of expected to say something on it and you don't really have a good answer, it's really tough to be out there and have people asking you and talking about it and be like, palms up dude, I don't know.
[02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:42.190]  You know?
[02:50:42.831 --> 02:50:45.634]  Is that what they say in the metal world?
[02:50:45.714 --> 02:50:47.035]  Palms up dude, I don't know.
[02:50:47.595 --> 02:50:49.157]  Let me try it again.
[02:50:49.457 --> 02:50:50.478]  Let me try it again.
[02:50:50.498 --> 02:50:50.959]  Let me get it right.
[02:50:51.559 --> 02:50:52.780]  Palms up dude, I don't know.
[02:50:53.381 --> 02:50:53.701]  Is that good?
[02:50:53.721 --> 02:50:54.322]  Pretty close.
[02:50:56.679 --> 02:51:01.160]  There was a little more condescension in your version than I think was intended.
[02:51:01.180 --> 02:51:01.520]  Oh, okay.
[02:51:01.540 --> 02:51:02.960]  So I should be like, palms up, dude.
[02:51:03.021 --> 02:51:03.401]  I don't know.
[02:51:04.121 --> 02:51:04.921]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:51:05.201 --> 02:51:05.761]  There we go.
[02:51:05.861 --> 02:51:06.501]  Perfect.
[02:51:06.521 --> 02:51:07.562]  I could be a rock singer.
[02:51:07.682 --> 02:51:08.462]  I could be a rock singer.
[02:51:08.542 --> 02:51:10.042]  I just have to learn to scream.
[02:51:10.282 --> 02:51:21.965]  There's the melodic screaming you guys do, which, you know, you can like hold a tune and say words at the same time as horrible eruptions are happening further down your esophagus.
[02:51:23.145 --> 02:51:26.289]  No, it's an entrancing thing to listen to.
[02:51:26.669 --> 02:51:28.251]  This is what gets me!
[02:51:28.472 --> 02:51:29.773]  This is what's so confusing!
[02:51:29.993 --> 02:51:34.218]  This is like the ultimate expression of hypermasculine aggressiveness!
[02:51:34.298 --> 02:51:35.319]  It's fabulous!
[02:51:35.379 --> 02:51:37.342]  And then you've got these people doing this...
[02:51:39.494 --> 02:51:43.339]  On stage and in their records, and they come off screen and say, oh yeah, we should have gun control.
[02:51:43.479 --> 02:51:44.961]  Yeah, yeah, please take our guns away.
[02:51:45.221 --> 02:51:45.982]  What the hell?!
[02:51:46.002 --> 02:51:53.532]  I, I, again, I'm not looking to dog anyone out, but they don't... the arguments don't make any sense to me.
[02:51:53.572 --> 02:51:54.814]  I don't feel like the arguments for...
[02:51:55.194 --> 02:52:05.586]  Gun control are good arguments, and I feel like we've experimented with an assault rifle ban, and there was no change in gun violence.
[02:52:05.746 --> 02:52:07.588]  We should not use the words of the enemy, by the way.
[02:52:07.628 --> 02:52:09.150]  We should avoid the phrase assault.
[02:52:09.170 --> 02:52:12.454]  Please don't use the phrase assault rifle, assault weapon.
[02:52:12.554 --> 02:52:13.315]  Just stop it.
[02:52:13.795 --> 02:52:15.916]  You see, this is it.
[02:52:16.196 --> 02:52:21.558]  Once you start using their language, you kind of implicitly accept some of their premises.
[02:52:21.838 --> 02:52:26.120]  Because as soon as you use the expression, assault weapons or assault rifle, you have to defend it.
[02:52:26.140 --> 02:52:29.702]  And it's like, well, you see, as is the case with assault weapons, there's no evidence.
[02:52:29.722 --> 02:52:31.222]  What do you mean assault weapons?
[02:52:31.402 --> 02:52:31.942]  Stop it!
[02:52:32.243 --> 02:52:32.783]  Stop it, Phil!
[02:52:33.583 --> 02:52:44.912]  That's the thing about it though, but I mean, it's much easier to say an assault rifle than it is to say a magazine-fed semi-automatic, or a gas-operated magazine-fed semi-automatic.
[02:52:44.932 --> 02:52:46.494]  But listen, this is where you're getting it wrong.
[02:52:46.614 --> 02:53:02.166]  Feminists don't talk about, you know, feminists have this whole language, you know, it's microaggressions, it's patriarchy, this is like a systematic, encoded expression of white cis, that is designed to exclude.
[02:53:03.107 --> 02:53:10.629]  If only gun advocates were a bit more arcane and obscure and difficult.
[02:53:10.649 --> 02:53:15.571]  No, if they were just like, well this is a bolt stock, X-mounted rack, blah blah blah blah.
[02:53:15.891 --> 02:53:17.951]  And you just see liberal journalists go, huh?
[02:53:20.632 --> 02:53:22.954]  That's what I was trying to avoid with the video in the first place.
[02:53:22.974 --> 02:53:24.555]  I was trying to help.
[02:53:24.575 --> 02:53:24.615]  No!
[02:53:24.735 --> 02:53:25.516]  Don't try to help.
[02:53:25.736 --> 02:53:26.877]  Stop trying to help.
[02:53:27.377 --> 02:53:28.278]  You're not helping.
[02:53:28.798 --> 02:53:30.479]  Stop trying to help.
[02:53:30.779 --> 02:53:33.081]  You're not going to persuade anybody who doesn't already agree with you.
[02:53:33.221 --> 02:53:40.826]  All you have to do is ridicule, bully, demean, and humiliate the enemy into utter and total submission.
[02:53:41.567 --> 02:53:42.788]  What are you thinking?
[02:53:43.188 --> 02:53:45.850]  Just tack nuke them, right?
[02:53:45.970 --> 02:53:47.731]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:50.152 --> 02:53:52.934]  Do to them what you do to your poor vocal cords.
[02:53:53.454 --> 02:53:57.556]  It is, of course, the 20th anniversary of All That Remains.
[02:53:58.857 --> 02:54:02.202]  Founding the band back in the day, you've been in the business for 20 years.
[02:54:03.143 --> 02:54:04.605]  Huge success is under your belt.
[02:54:04.645 --> 02:54:14.179]  You are, as I said just before we went to break last time, just to pay you one final compliment and then I promise for the entire rest of the time we know each other, for the next seven decades I will do nothing but call you a...
[02:54:15.220 --> 02:54:16.881]  Things I can't say on this show because it's syndicated.
[02:54:16.901 --> 02:54:20.602]  I will do nothing.
[02:54:20.962 --> 02:54:24.223]  The things that make me feel like I'm dear to you.
[02:54:24.463 --> 02:54:25.923]  Yes, yes, yes.
[02:54:26.023 --> 02:54:26.503]  Taunting.
[02:54:26.523 --> 02:54:27.524]  Call me a name.
[02:54:27.644 --> 02:54:29.624]  Taunting is how men bond, you know.
[02:54:29.644 --> 02:54:31.345]  Absolutely.
[02:54:31.405 --> 02:54:33.866]  Being mean to each other is how we express our love.
[02:54:34.246 --> 02:54:41.008]  And this is why when feminists say, can't you just treat us like you treat each other, I'm thinking to myself, sweetheart, you do not want that.
[02:54:41.748 --> 02:54:43.369]  Treat you like I treat my friends.
[02:54:43.389 --> 02:54:45.029]  I'm gonna be like pranking you.
[02:54:45.329 --> 02:54:46.670]  I'm gonna be abusing you.
[02:54:46.770 --> 02:54:48.230]  I'm gonna be ridiculing you.
[02:54:48.550 --> 02:54:50.191]  I'm gonna be laughing at you.
[02:54:50.311 --> 02:54:52.171]  I'm gonna be setting you up to fail.
[02:54:52.492 --> 02:54:58.233]  I'm gonna have seven people in a bar laughing at you because I heard that your penis was small.
[02:54:58.873 --> 02:55:02.074]  You do not want men to treat you like they treat each other.
[02:55:02.215 --> 02:55:02.975]  You do not.
[02:55:03.055 --> 02:55:03.155]  No.
[02:55:03.915 --> 02:55:04.195]  Anyway.
[02:55:04.275 --> 02:55:14.157]  And the thing is, and the thing is, and we can go off on this for hours and hours, you go ahead and you treat them like that, and then they go to the police, they're like, oh, they, you know, to HR.
[02:55:14.577 --> 02:55:24.940]  Well, you see, the women have, you know what, I'm not going to get you into trouble by continuing this discussion, because I already know that metal sucks.
[02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:30.781]  Imagine reading a blog, and this is the, and just to finish up with you, because I know you've got to go, you're a busy guy, but
[02:55:31.721 --> 02:55:34.423]  This is a social justice left-wing blog about metal.
[02:55:34.463 --> 02:55:35.743]  So it's got a readership of nine.
[02:55:36.524 --> 02:55:38.165]  But they call it metal sucks.
[02:55:38.245 --> 02:55:41.227]  It's like they don't hide their contempt for the art form.
[02:55:41.267 --> 02:55:42.587]  It's right there in plain view.
[02:55:43.208 --> 02:55:45.729]  Then they say so in this in this ludicrous manifesto.
[02:55:46.190 --> 02:55:49.672]  We will not tolerate hate speech or threats leveled at us or anyone who reads our site.
[02:55:50.012 --> 02:55:50.872]  Blah blah blah.
[02:55:51.333 --> 02:55:56.316]  If you disagree with any of the above to the point of intolerance, please feel free to take your readership elsewhere.
[02:55:56.356 --> 02:55:58.497]  We will not miss you or we won't miss you either.
[02:55:59.477 --> 02:56:00.437]  What's intolerance?
[02:56:00.537 --> 02:56:03.098]  I mean, is it disagreeing?
[02:56:03.538 --> 02:56:04.818]  Yes, yes, it's disagreeing.
[02:56:05.039 --> 02:56:06.079]  Intolerance is disagreeing.
[02:56:07.119 --> 02:56:12.160]  Well, I think people will make up their own minds about which side of the debate to sit on there.
[02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:22.583]  All I think is sad is that even icons in industries that would previously have been utterly immune from social justice and from the pressures of the regressive left
[02:56:23.383 --> 02:56:24.484]  Seem to be toppling as well.
[02:56:24.944 --> 02:56:26.465]  And they topple for the worst of reasons.
[02:56:26.546 --> 02:56:27.846]  They topple over emotions.
[02:56:28.367 --> 02:56:34.712]  They topple over emotionally charged news stories instead of facts, reason and logic.
[02:56:34.732 --> 02:56:44.579]  Well, at least if you if you're wondering where next to point your ears and your pocketbook, consider All That Remains instead of one of these other cut
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:47.141]  Phil, thanks so much for joining us.
[02:56:47.181 --> 02:56:50.063]  Congratulations on your 20th anniversary.
[02:56:50.083 --> 02:56:52.545]  20 years in the business, still on top.
[02:56:52.965 --> 02:56:57.729]  And thank you for resisting the seductive entreaties, the siren call.
[02:56:58.109 --> 02:57:04.875]  You've strapped yourself to the mast so you can sail past the island unscathed and...
[02:57:07.116 --> 02:57:09.497]  Untainted by social justice corruption.
[02:57:10.217 --> 02:57:10.877]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:11.457 --> 02:57:13.158]  Thank you very much, and I'm sure we'll see you again.
[02:57:14.438 --> 02:57:16.138]  It's remarkable to me.
[02:57:16.198 --> 02:57:17.199]  Thank you so much, Phil Labonte.
[02:57:17.979 --> 02:57:24.901]  It's remarkable to me how even rock and metal singers... It's all over.
[02:57:25.181 --> 02:57:25.621]  It's all over.
[02:57:25.861 --> 02:57:27.201]  We've got to create your own culture, folks.
[02:57:27.221 --> 02:57:29.782]  You've got to support people who are not mental.
[02:57:31.775 --> 02:57:38.061]  Make your own bans and stop paying attention to the crazies of the social justice lunatic universe.
[02:57:39.062 --> 02:57:39.643]  Thank you very much.
[02:57:39.823 --> 02:57:42.085]  Next hour, I'm sorry, you've got me again.
[02:57:42.366 --> 02:57:43.947]  We're going to be looking at some video clips.
[02:57:43.967 --> 02:57:45.449]  The left, using children.
[02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:47.691]  We've got Laura Loomer coming up and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:57:47.711 --> 02:57:48.412]  Thank you very much.
[02:57:48.732 --> 02:57:50.234]  We will be right back after these messages.
[02:57:54.326 --> 02:57:58.770]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:57:58.990 --> 02:58:03.693]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:58:04.294 --> 02:58:10.138]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[02:58:10.559 --> 02:58:23.149]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[02:58:23.909 --> 02:58:32.617]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:58:32.637 --> 02:58:34.519]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:58:34.839 --> 02:58:36.000]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:58:36.020 --> 02:58:37.222]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:58:37.242 --> 02:58:38.643]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:58:38.843 --> 02:58:40.324]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:58:40.845 --> 02:58:42.466]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:58:42.786 --> 02:58:44.247]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:58:44.588 --> 02:58:47.210]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:58:47.250 --> 02:58:48.110]  This is insane.
[02:58:48.511 --> 02:58:50.132]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:58:50.392 --> 02:58:52.954]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:58:53.395 --> 02:58:54.916]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:58:54.956 --> 02:58:56.777]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:58:56.797 --> 02:58:58.659]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:05.444]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:59:05.705 --> 02:59:07.046]  All just moderate dose.
[02:59:08.561 --> 02:59:16.551]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:59:16.571 --> 02:59:18.954]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:18.974 --> 02:59:20.156]  But thank you for committing.
[02:59:24.216 --> 02:59:27.039]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:59:27.419 --> 02:59:30.022]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:59:30.042 --> 02:59:34.807]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:59:35.287 --> 02:59:41.413]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:59:41.433 --> 02:59:44.556]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:59:44.876 --> 02:59:46.198]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:59:54.918 --> 02:59:59.021]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.562 --> 03:00:00.883]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.446 --> 03:00:13.072]  You want answers?
[03:00:13.673 --> 03:00:14.794]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:15.474 --> 03:00:20.198]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.777 --> 03:00:25.518]  He lies, he lies.
[03:00:25.538 --> 03:00:27.880]  The man in the sky lies.
[03:00:27.940 --> 03:00:28.760]  It isn't Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:30.241]  I'm sorry to disappoint you.
[03:00:30.921 --> 03:00:39.046]  It's me, I'm Marlon Oppus, standing in for Alex Jones in this final hour coming into of the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.
[03:00:39.086 --> 03:00:41.808]  And I have been asked to tell you about this.
[03:00:41.908 --> 03:00:46.431]  I have previously, by the way, tried out some of the InfoWars store products.
[03:00:47.051 --> 03:00:49.153]  I had Brain Force the first time I did the show.
[03:00:50.307 --> 03:00:52.088]  I did feel more energised, I have to be honest.
[03:00:52.468 --> 03:00:56.250]  Although I had a little handful of them, so maybe I temporarily overdosed.
[03:00:57.471 --> 03:00:59.933]  But I did feel a little peppy.
[03:01:00.393 --> 03:01:04.235]  Could have been the presence of the Dark Lord in this chair.
[03:01:04.935 --> 03:01:05.756]  Maybe it was the brain force?
[03:01:05.936 --> 03:01:06.276]  Who knows?
[03:01:06.396 --> 03:01:06.877]  Give it a try.
[03:01:07.477 --> 03:01:08.518]  This is Ikirin.
[03:01:09.338 --> 03:01:19.324]  I've always wanted to be one of those girls, you know, the women on game shows that show the washing machines or the vacuum cleaners.
[03:01:19.744 --> 03:01:25.225]  You know, and if you open box 7, you could win this Electrolux vacuum cleaner.
[03:01:25.245 --> 03:01:28.586]  And the girl said, alas, it was not to be.
[03:01:29.326 --> 03:01:38.027]  Icurine, it's simple, more toxins and diseases find their way into your system, and more important it is that your body's detox systems can keep up, because your liver and kidneys are the most important detoxifiers.
[03:01:38.067 --> 03:01:47.289]  This is a 30-day liver cleanse, and they didn't give this to me, but I am going to take it and try it, and report back the next time they are
[03:01:47.629 --> 03:01:49.534]  Stupid enough to allow me back in the studio.
[03:01:50.155 --> 03:01:52.260]  Milk Thistle Extract, which I've heard is good.
[03:01:52.882 --> 03:01:54.044]  It's a powerful set of ingredients.
[03:01:54.525 --> 03:01:56.931]  Support your liver and kidneys to help fight back against toxins.
[03:01:59.127 --> 03:02:01.069]  I'm on a bit of a diet at the moment so I don't have many toxins.
[03:02:01.109 --> 03:02:02.291]  But let's see, I'll report back.
[03:02:02.571 --> 03:02:03.432]  I'll let you know how it is.
[03:02:03.612 --> 03:02:07.917]  Alright, now the Department of Homeland Security, just a little brief story before we have to go to our break.
[03:02:07.937 --> 03:02:10.780]  This is our short segment but I just want to tell you a bit about this and we'll carry on when we get back.
[03:02:11.722 --> 03:02:18.950]  Department of Homeland Security is going to publish proof, it's a story on InfoWars, of massive Democrat voter fraud in 2016.
[03:02:20.796 --> 03:02:29.479]  And this is according to someone who has been QAnon, who has been tantalizing the internet with his insider scoops on the Trump administration.
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:44.225]  The Director of National Intelligence together with the Department of Homeland Security, reports Jerome Corsi for InfoWars, says they're planning to publish in March a study of the 2016 elections that will demonstrate massive Democrat Party voter fraud.
[03:02:46.220 --> 03:02:51.043]  Of a magnitude sufficient to have influenced election outcomes.
[03:02:52.204 --> 03:03:02.151]  President Trump signed an executive order disbanding the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in 2018 because states controlled by the Democrats refused to cooperate.
[03:03:02.611 --> 03:03:09.956]  Many Democrats breathed a sigh of relief thinking he'd given up his effort to uncover and correct decades of Democrat Party voter fraud.
[03:03:10.416 --> 03:03:11.257]  But it turns out
[03:03:12.037 --> 03:03:13.818]  That something might be there after all.
[03:03:14.178 --> 03:03:15.099]  And it's remarkable, isn't it?
[03:03:15.119 --> 03:03:26.644]  You know, you've got all these... We'll talk about Michael Moore and the Russia-funded anti-Trump protest later in the show when we have Laura Loomer, who's up there in Florida.
[03:03:27.525 --> 03:03:28.625]  But it's remarkable, isn't it?
[03:03:28.685 --> 03:03:30.326]  The allegations that have come to nothing.
[03:03:30.666 --> 03:03:34.948]  There is no evidence whatsoever that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.
[03:03:35.409 --> 03:03:35.589]  None.
[03:03:37.256 --> 03:03:43.161]  And what evidence there is that Russia may have attempted to interfere in the American election is muddy at best.
[03:03:45.824 --> 03:03:55.413]  One thing Russia did was fund an anti-Trump rally, which Michael Moore was at, because he is the definition of a useful idiot.
[03:03:56.488 --> 03:04:01.873]  So no, the Trump campaign, as far as we know right now, did not collude with Russia.
[03:04:01.973 --> 03:04:09.020]  And Russia, as far as we know right now, did not affect the outcome of the US presidential election.
[03:04:11.062 --> 03:04:21.091]  But voter fraud, which conservatives have always said, was something the Democrats have been up to in every election since forever.
[03:04:22.952 --> 03:04:23.693]  Might have made a difference.
[03:04:23.973 --> 03:04:25.534]  Not enough to swing it, obviously.
[03:04:26.395 --> 03:04:27.836]  But maybe it made a difference.
[03:04:28.056 --> 03:04:29.197]  Maybe he would have won by more.
[03:04:29.818 --> 03:04:36.943]  Maybe that illusory 3 million mystery Hillary voters, who knows?
[03:04:36.963 --> 03:04:40.306]  It's amazing how dead people always seem to vote Democrat.
[03:04:40.866 --> 03:04:43.929]  I guess we'll find out when DHS publishes this report.
[03:04:43.949 --> 03:04:44.529]  Very exciting.
[03:04:44.589 --> 03:04:47.292]  We'll get into that a little more when we come back.
[03:04:48.313 --> 03:04:49.014]  Very exciting.
[03:04:49.535 --> 03:04:56.826]  A study of the 2016 elections demonstrating massive Democrat party voter fraud of a magnitude sufficient to have influenced election outcomes.
[03:04:56.926 --> 03:04:57.347]  Incredible.
[03:04:57.387 --> 03:04:57.928]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:03.251 --> 03:05:07.974]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[03:05:08.254 --> 03:05:13.818]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[03:05:13.898 --> 03:05:22.944]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.

[03:05:31.010 --> 03:05:32.991]  That's FortifiedSupply.com.

[03:05:59.464 --> 03:06:02.085]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:06:04.755 --> 03:06:07.216]  He's going the distance.
[03:06:07.316 --> 03:06:09.797]  He's going for speed.
[03:06:09.977 --> 03:06:11.637]  She's all alone.
[03:06:12.017 --> 03:06:15.218]  All alone in a time of need.
[03:06:15.258 --> 03:06:18.299]  Because he's racing and racing and plotting a course.
[03:06:18.719 --> 03:06:22.241]  He's fighting and fighting and riding on his horse.
[03:06:22.321 --> 03:06:23.521]  He's going the distance.
[03:06:24.621 --> 03:06:27.602]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:06:28.182 --> 03:06:29.463]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:36.243 --> 03:06:36.964]  Hello.
[03:06:37.044 --> 03:06:37.704]  We are back.
[03:06:37.844 --> 03:06:42.488]  This is... I don't know why I'm speaking like an Edwardian English gentleman.
[03:06:42.548 --> 03:06:44.569]  We're back on InfoWars.
[03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:48.152]  I'm Milo Yiannopoulos, standing in for Alex Jones.
[03:06:48.432 --> 03:06:52.936]  That's how we used to speak in my country before we got enamored with America.
[03:06:53.256 --> 03:06:54.237]  Fell in love with you guys.
[03:06:54.617 --> 03:07:00.582]  Now I sound like some kind of... some kind of Mid-Atlantic hussy.
[03:07:02.338 --> 03:07:02.819]  Madonna.
[03:07:03.459 --> 03:07:04.200]  Gillian Anderson.
[03:07:05.482 --> 03:07:13.332]  In the short segment, we mentioned a new story on InfoWars.com which bears repeating, so let's just have a quick recap of it.
[03:07:13.672 --> 03:07:17.317]  Who knew after... Here's something, here's a tip for you.
[03:07:18.576 --> 03:07:41.546]  When social justice warriors, liberals, democrats, the left in general, laughs hysterically at a claim made by the right for which we don't yet have conclusive evidence but all the signs point that way, and anybody with half a brain can see it's probably true, and when it's floated, the left finds a way to turn it into an object of ridicule.
[03:07:41.947 --> 03:07:44.748]  Most recently, for instance, that strange marking
[03:07:45.888 --> 03:07:46.068]  I think?
[03:08:03.248 --> 03:08:05.790]  An unusual shape on the former president's forehead.
[03:08:06.210 --> 03:08:07.831]  Something left there by Michelle, perhaps.
[03:08:09.672 --> 03:08:11.633]  One of the things that... Yes, there it is.
[03:08:15.575 --> 03:08:25.361]  Draw your own conclusions as to whether an artist with a long history of including spermatozoa in his artworks
[03:08:26.320 --> 03:08:30.481]  May have mischievously snuck one into the most important painting he'll ever do.
[03:08:30.881 --> 03:08:41.104]  His signature, his trademark, his signature move is hiding the little swimmers in his artwork.
[03:08:42.244 --> 03:08:44.245]  And we're expected to believe that he did not do it.
[03:08:44.952 --> 03:08:52.518]  In the Obama portrait, despite the fact that I think everybody can see the little... And in fact, if you colour it, so you can see... I mean, you guys know by now.
[03:08:53.198 --> 03:09:06.868]  Anyway, when Democrats are laughing at you, when they are sniggering and scoffing and making you feel stupid, and that's how you know, that's the one to look out for, when they are doing their darndest to make you feel like an idiot,
[03:09:08.226 --> 03:09:10.287]  It's often the best sign that you're onto something.
[03:09:10.807 --> 03:09:21.250]  And the best new piece of reporting to establish this immutable and everlasting observation comes from InfoWars.com.
[03:09:21.270 --> 03:09:23.610]  Jerome Corset, writing InfoWars.
[03:09:23.810 --> 03:09:30.772]  The Department of Homeland Security is about to publish proof of massive Democrat voting fraud.
[03:09:31.873 --> 03:09:33.173]  And not just voting fraud.
[03:09:35.003 --> 03:09:39.946]  This comes, by the way, from QAnon, who is the... We don't know who he is.
[03:09:40.006 --> 03:09:41.387]  He seems to be an insider.
[03:09:43.348 --> 03:09:45.689]  Some presence around Trump.
[03:09:46.129 --> 03:09:46.510]  Who knows?
[03:09:46.850 --> 03:09:52.213]  Of course, again, that's one that the liberals have tried to make you feel stupid about, thinking that he might be real.
[03:09:52.313 --> 03:09:54.534]  But all of the verisimilitude is there.
[03:09:55.735 --> 03:09:58.937]  And so he says, this is a report on Infowars.com, you can go find it.
[03:09:59.668 --> 03:10:24.407]  The Director of National Intelligence, together with the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, are planning to publish in March a study of the 2016 elections that will demonstrate massive Democrat Party voter fraud of a magnitude, and here's the key section, of a magnitude sufficient to have influenced election outcomes.
[03:10:26.124 --> 03:10:26.904]  That's the killer line.
[03:10:27.084 --> 03:10:28.105]  That's the one to take away with you.
[03:10:28.865 --> 03:10:40.229]  When they laugh at you, when they call you stupid, when they scoff at you, when the verified liberals on Twitter... Imagine these idiots believing this.
[03:10:42.779 --> 03:10:45.681]  When they do that, it's a reasonably good sign that you're onto something.
[03:10:46.241 --> 03:10:54.547]  Alright, later in the show, in this final hour, we're going to be speaking to Laura Loomer, who is a former Project Veritas operative.
[03:10:54.587 --> 03:10:57.229]  She's now an independent investigative journalist.
[03:10:57.309 --> 03:11:05.734]  She went into Mandalay Bay, after Mandalay Bay said they'd fixed their security problems, and rode the elevator up and down the service elevator.
[03:11:06.054 --> 03:11:10.597]  She's now in Florida, and she's going to join us at about half past to talk to you about the
[03:11:11.974 --> 03:11:22.841]  The machinations of everyone's favourite cable news network, CNN, who for some reason are hosting a rehearsal of their town hall meeting.
[03:11:22.901 --> 03:11:38.991]  It's like a free, open debate that CNN is hosting, but they're having a rehearsal for it, presumably so that if anyone brings up any really good persuasive arguments against gun control, that they can be fully prepared for them and know how to swat them down.
[03:11:40.080 --> 03:11:40.600]  Good Lord.
[03:11:41.440 --> 03:11:42.401]  So Laura Loomis is going to join us.
[03:11:42.421 --> 03:11:47.722]  We're going to play a video later in the show of her confronting local officials.
[03:11:48.302 --> 03:12:05.166]  But in the meantime, before we get to all that, I want to move on to something that liberals have done increasingly in recent years, probably in the last half decade, which is using children to promulgate their political ideologies.
[03:12:06.690 --> 03:12:26.515]  Using young people to tug on the heartstrings of reasonable but perhaps impressionable ordinary Americans, to try to persuade them of things that cannot be established with fact, reason and logic alone, and which therefore must be intimidated and bullied and manipulated into the public consciousness with appeals
[03:12:27.455 --> 03:12:27.955]  To the heart.
[03:12:28.836 --> 03:12:45.391]  So the first clip I want to play is of the Florida school shooting survivor and it's this little guy David Hogg and he's on CNN and he's being asked to talk about Trump's tweet after the Florida school shooting.
[03:12:45.431 --> 03:12:46.312]  So let's play that clip.
[03:12:46.832 --> 03:12:52.237]  It's about a minute and it's a Florida school shooting survivor turned resistance poster boy.
[03:12:53.181 --> 03:13:01.625]  David Hogg, who said on Monday on CNN that Trump should be blamed for the shooting and not the FBI, where, well, just coincidentally, his dad used to work.
[03:13:01.665 --> 03:13:02.205]  Let's play that clip.
[03:13:03.646 --> 03:13:06.327]  What did you both think about the president tweeting over the weekend?
[03:13:06.387 --> 03:13:10.889]  Very sad that the FBI missed all the signs, signals sent out by the Florida school shooter.
[03:13:10.929 --> 03:13:11.750]  This is not acceptable.
[03:13:12.030 --> 03:13:16.732]  They're spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.
[03:13:16.772 --> 03:13:17.972]  There is no collusion.
[03:13:18.353 --> 03:13:20.374]  Get back to basics and make us all proud.
[03:13:20.914 --> 03:13:21.054]  Yeah.
[03:13:22.529 --> 03:13:23.950]  I think it's disgusting, personally.
[03:13:24.071 --> 03:13:29.456]  My father's a retired FBI agent, and the FBI are some of the hardest working individuals I've ever seen in my life.
[03:13:29.736 --> 03:13:34.280]  They work every day, 24-7, to ensure the lives of every single American in this country.
[03:13:34.640 --> 03:13:36.983]  And it's wrong that the President is blaming them for this.
[03:13:37.363 --> 03:13:39.205]  After all, he is in charge of the FBI.
[03:13:39.785 --> 03:13:41.827]  You can almost see him reading a teleprompter.
[03:13:41.847 --> 03:13:50.492]  I don't know if he is, but there's a certain... I can tell you as a performer, there's a sort of glazed look in your eyes when you're reading out, you know, a script that you've rehearsed and he got the look.
[03:13:51.333 --> 03:13:59.418]  CNN has been coaching young people to give these impassioned, desperate, emotional entreaties with talking points cooked up.
[03:14:00.319 --> 03:14:01.921]  By people in the intelligence agencies.
[03:14:01.941 --> 03:14:05.865]  I mean, this guy's dad was in the FBI, undisclosed by CNN.
[03:14:06.325 --> 03:14:09.869]  But just watch, and we'll play a little bit of this before we go to break and then I'm going to come back to it afterwards.
[03:14:10.169 --> 03:14:14.894]  Just watch what happens when the same student can't remember his lines.
[03:14:15.555 --> 03:14:17.477]  Interviewed on a different occasion.
[03:14:18.297 --> 03:14:34.130]  This comes from our Gateway Pundit, our friends over at Gateway Pundit, and this is David Hogg stumbling over his words in an interview talking about drills on the day of the shooting when he has forgotten the talking points presumably provided to him by his FBI, former FBI agent dad.
[03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:35.451]  Watch this one.
[03:14:36.661 --> 03:14:41.662]  We had a fire alarm earlier that day, and that was a drill, so we thought this was a drill too, just another one.
[03:14:42.043 --> 03:14:48.244]  Because we have a lot of fire alarms, a lot of fire drills at the school.
[03:14:49.385 --> 03:14:51.765]  After we heard the first one, we thought it was a drill.
[03:14:51.785 --> 03:14:53.526]  Actually, that was a bad choice.
[03:14:53.546 --> 03:14:56.127]  It's okay, you're fine.
[03:14:56.207 --> 03:14:58.988]  Actually, that was a bad choice because the janitor... Sorry.
[03:14:59.048 --> 03:15:00.228]  It's okay, you're fine.
[03:15:02.343 --> 03:15:06.364]  Lucas, this isn't like a bad child actor's like, I'm sorry daddy, I forgot my lines.
[03:15:06.724 --> 03:15:08.765]  I'm sorry, was that what I was supposed to say?
[03:15:09.005 --> 03:15:13.486]  You wanted me to say guns are bad and Trump's a piece of whatever, didn't you?
[03:15:13.786 --> 03:15:14.507]  Did I get it right?
[03:15:14.827 --> 03:15:16.167]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[03:15:16.187 --> 03:15:18.868]  Look, look, doesn't this kid suffer enough?
[03:15:19.858 --> 03:15:22.720]  Hasn't he had a bad enough time already, being nearly killed?
[03:15:22.740 --> 03:15:27.502]  You gotta leap on the poor little devil and have him spout platitudes?
[03:15:27.542 --> 03:15:36.087]  Let me tell you, nobody is as mellifluous and fluent and eloquent as those kids were when coached by CNN.
[03:15:36.407 --> 03:15:40.109]  And indeed, when you see them interviewed by other people, they're not.
[03:15:40.810 --> 03:15:42.911]  Simple explanation for this, which is they're being fed lines.
[03:15:42.931 --> 03:15:45.573]  This is another example of the left moving in on children.
[03:15:45.593 --> 03:15:47.574]  It's bad enough they're drugging all the boys.
[03:15:48.214 --> 03:15:49.715]  And cutting their wieners off.
[03:15:49.735 --> 03:15:51.656]  Pretending they're trans.
[03:15:52.597 --> 03:15:55.399]  Now they're putting words in their mouth to take away your Second Amendment rights.
[03:15:55.519 --> 03:15:56.040]  Disgusting.
[03:15:56.320 --> 03:15:58.041]  We'll be right back with more.
[03:15:58.061 --> 03:16:01.463]  Maybe we'll play that clip again and then we're going on to see the clip from another student.
[03:16:01.583 --> 03:16:02.064]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:02.504 --> 03:16:03.184]  Info Wars.
[03:16:04.205 --> 03:16:05.166]  My radio program.
[03:16:05.686 --> 03:16:06.667]  Our TV broadcast.
[03:16:07.107 --> 03:16:07.588]  Our films.
[03:16:08.648 --> 03:16:12.851]  ...are among some of the biggest viral sensations in the last 20 years.
[03:16:13.551 --> 03:16:14.992]  And we're bringing back nationalism.
[03:16:15.012 --> 03:16:16.273]  We're bringing back sovereignty.
[03:16:16.533 --> 03:16:21.816]  We're bringing back true populism and rule for, of, and by the people.
[03:16:22.236 --> 03:16:36.404]  And that's why Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other mainstream media outlets, the modern robber barons of our age, admit, even in congressional hearings and in undercover videos, that the number one enemy to shut down is InfoWars.
[03:16:36.884 --> 03:16:51.833]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYC terrorist attack, which is quote trending, marked with a red button saying quote live,
[03:16:52.854 --> 03:17:02.321]  The top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City terror, he was too busy bashing Trump.
[03:17:02.981 --> 03:17:10.307]  This is a real time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[03:17:11.227 --> 03:17:18.673]  How quickly can you act and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[03:17:19.393 --> 03:17:22.997]  That's something we're thinking about all the time, because it's a bad user experience.
[03:17:23.297 --> 03:17:24.398]  The system self-corrected.
[03:17:24.518 --> 03:17:27.361]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[03:17:27.381 --> 03:17:29.603]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[03:17:30.804 --> 03:17:31.584]  But you saw this?
[03:17:31.805 --> 03:17:32.545]  USA Today.
[03:17:32.946 --> 03:17:34.087]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[03:17:34.227 --> 03:17:35.928]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[03:17:36.949 --> 03:17:45.720]  At the very least, we can say that this shelf of videos from news partners is legitimate news, because we know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[03:17:46.541 --> 03:17:51.587]  And if at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well...
[03:17:52.328 --> 03:17:54.111]  They were looking for him, not speaking with anyone.
[03:17:54.552 --> 03:18:00.500]  So they shadow ban our videos, they block our articles, they ban us from advertising on Google platforms.
[03:18:00.981 --> 03:18:05.327]  That's why it's so essential that you continue to stand in the face of their censorship.
[03:18:05.548 --> 03:18:08.151]  Because if they can shut us down, they can shut you down.
[03:18:08.732 --> 03:18:12.595]  But because of their brazenness, it's caused the Streisand effect.
[03:18:13.395 --> 03:18:21.000]  And they're now panicking because their attempts to censor us have only made the message expand and get out in ways it never would have.
[03:18:21.680 --> 03:18:25.343]  So I know a lot of you are smarter than I am, and you've got great, inventive ways to take action.
[03:18:25.843 --> 03:18:35.209]  But however you do it, spreading articles, spreading videos, on your own email list, telling friends and family about the censored information in person, however you do it, calling in to C-SPAN,
[03:18:36.742 --> 03:18:43.282]  Getting on other shows online, letting them know that InfoWars is the tip of the spear, and that if we can be censored successfully...
[03:18:44.452 --> 03:18:45.973]  All of you can be censored as well.
[03:18:46.453 --> 03:18:50.095]  So be sure and like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter.
[03:18:50.375 --> 03:18:52.296]  Be sure to send out the videos, the articles.
[03:18:53.317 --> 03:18:56.318]  Be sure to report on anything we've covered that you think is important.
[03:18:56.538 --> 03:18:59.620]  Feel free to re-upload our videos and post them wherever you like.
[03:18:59.760 --> 03:19:01.401]  All of it is copyright free.
[03:19:01.901 --> 03:19:03.402]  Be sure and click the notifications.
[03:19:04.042 --> 03:19:09.185]  Be sure and subscribe to all of our great channels because we're in a real fight.
[03:19:09.485 --> 03:19:09.645]  I think?
[03:19:29.685 --> 03:19:31.726]  It's evil, and together we're gonna defeat it.
[03:19:32.126 --> 03:19:44.611]  So folks, you have absolutely been the resistance, you have cut through all their propaganda, and because of that I salute you, and I ask you now, more than ever, to redouble your efforts, because if you're watching this transmission and listening, you are the resistance.
[03:19:55.976 --> 03:19:57.857]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[03:20:06.781 --> 03:20:09.544]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.073 --> 03:20:19.256]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:19.776 --> 03:20:24.902]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:20:30.040 --> 03:20:38.086]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, where our speech is free, our guns are loaded, and the only thing we want aborted is political correctness.
[03:20:38.927 --> 03:20:42.550]  Before the break, we play two videos of the same poor kid.
[03:20:43.718 --> 03:20:46.160]  Stumbling over his words because he'd forgotten his coaching.
[03:20:46.240 --> 03:20:48.681]  Let's go straight to a third video that I want to show you.
[03:20:49.001 --> 03:20:53.484]  And it's a different Parkland, Florida student wishing... Well, I'll show you what happens.
[03:20:53.664 --> 03:21:04.170]  This video is what happens when kids are not given talking points by their intelligence agency, globalist, gun control, government oversight, overreach.
[03:21:05.631 --> 03:21:06.532]  Oh, it just makes me mad.
[03:21:07.753 --> 03:21:10.854]  When kids aren't given scripted lines, here's what's more likely to happen.
[03:21:11.155 --> 03:21:11.455]  Watch this.
[03:21:13.171 --> 03:21:18.064]  Well let me ask you, this debate is now emerging about guns on campus.
[03:21:18.786 --> 03:21:21.332]  Do you believe that's something that we should be looking at?
[03:21:23.419 --> 03:21:23.939]  Absolutely.
[03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:28.881]  Unfortunately, the gun control, it's definitely needed a little bit more.
[03:21:29.781 --> 03:21:33.823]  I don't think that we're going to get gun control in such a quick enough response.
[03:21:34.283 --> 03:21:46.687]  I believe that if we did bring firearms on campus to teachers that are willing to carry their firearm on school campus, if they got their correct training for it, I think that would be a big beneficial factor into school safety.
[03:21:47.107 --> 03:21:51.169]  Because, I mean, if Coach Feist had had his firearm in school that day... There we go.
[03:21:52.210 --> 03:22:06.391]  Out of the mouths of, well, not quite babes, of course he's a little older than the previous speaker, but still a student, ROTC student, seen a little bit more of the world, doesn't presumably have a left-wing globalist FBI dad.
[03:22:07.614 --> 03:22:08.755]  Able to speak a bit more freely.
[03:22:09.056 --> 03:22:09.496]  And there we go.
[03:22:09.516 --> 03:22:16.744]  We're going to bring in Laura Loomer who is on the ground in Florida to talk a little bit more about the aftermath of the shooting.
[03:22:16.764 --> 03:22:19.006]  But before we do that, I'm going to play a video.
[03:22:19.367 --> 03:22:20.668]  This is our video segment.
[03:22:20.928 --> 03:22:25.854]  I'm going to play a video of her confronting an anti-gun Florida congressman.
[03:22:26.414 --> 03:22:28.557]  Now I'll read you what she got up to.
[03:22:28.897 --> 03:22:30.718]  And then you can see Laura in action.
[03:22:30.738 --> 03:22:33.440]  One of the things that's fun about her, she really is fearless.
[03:22:33.820 --> 03:22:35.841]  I know Laura gets a lot of criticism online.
[03:22:35.881 --> 03:22:42.586]  She gets a lot of ridicule, mainly because she once struggled to tell the difference between a slash tyre and a dry rot tyre.
[03:22:43.286 --> 03:22:45.688]  I had her on my show and I made her play Rot or Not.
[03:22:46.188 --> 03:22:50.971]  I put pictures of tyres up and I have to tell you, she had a very good strike rate.
[03:22:52.003 --> 03:22:53.244]  So maybe it was just the one-off.
[03:22:53.984 --> 03:23:00.509]  Anyway, Laura's been up there and there's a, there's a, um, there is a Ted Deutsch, I guess his name is?
[03:23:00.849 --> 03:23:01.950]  Is that how you say it in America?
[03:23:02.010 --> 03:23:08.174]  Ted Deutsch lying to his constituents, telling them AR-15s are assault weapons and were banned before 2004.
[03:23:08.534 --> 03:23:15.639]  All this is a lie and this was a gun control meeting hosted by Everytown, one of the nation's largest anti-gun organizations.
[03:23:15.819 --> 03:23:20.742]  Laura went to confront this guy for lying to his constituents.
[03:23:20.902 --> 03:23:21.563]  Here's what happened.
[03:23:24.282 --> 03:23:26.365]  I'll actually let me just go before you ask any questions.
[03:23:26.385 --> 03:23:27.547]  You're from Infowars?
[03:23:28.087 --> 03:23:28.348]  Yes.
[03:23:28.568 --> 03:23:29.790]  Here's my message to you.
[03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:38.002]  The fact that you're, I won't even call it a publication, I don't know what it is, but the fact that you
[03:23:39.244 --> 03:23:49.273]  called What Happened in Sandy Hook a Hoax, refused to apologize for it, is among the most obscene things that has ever been broadcast anywhere.
[03:23:49.894 --> 03:23:51.055]  You should be ashamed.
[03:23:51.495 --> 03:23:55.919]  Anyone who reads the garbage like that that you post should be ashamed.
[03:23:56.320 --> 03:23:58.582]  And I will never give an interview to you.
[03:23:59.617 --> 03:24:05.958]  So you're calling about 40% of the country absolute garbage?
[03:24:05.998 --> 03:24:15.360]  You know, as a congressman, you're supposed to represent Republicans and Democrats, not just the base that you want to pander to and lie to during your speech about gun control.
[03:24:15.380 --> 03:24:16.241]  Let me tell you something.
[03:24:16.401 --> 03:24:18.801]  Every Republican that I know... He can't resist.
[03:24:18.921 --> 03:24:19.881]  Pause that for a second.
[03:24:19.901 --> 03:24:20.422]  Pause that for a second.
[03:24:20.822 --> 03:24:21.542]  He can't resist.
[03:24:21.822 --> 03:24:23.282]  This is the... Look.
[03:24:24.542 --> 03:24:26.583]  The Sandy Hook thing, you know,
[03:24:28.393 --> 03:24:37.016]  Let's take the uncharitable perspective, and let's take the uncharitable route and say that, you know, say somebody messed up on a... You know what?
[03:24:38.176 --> 03:24:38.896]  Let's generalize it.
[03:24:39.496 --> 03:24:42.657]  Breitbart, Infowars, Daily Caller, Gateway Pundit.
[03:24:43.458 --> 03:24:44.158]  All make mistakes.
[03:24:44.498 --> 03:24:45.578]  Everybody makes mistakes.
[03:24:46.638 --> 03:24:47.639]  Everybody makes mistakes.
[03:24:47.699 --> 03:24:48.879]  It's in the business of doing news.
[03:24:48.939 --> 03:24:51.660]  It's called process journalism, you people call it.
[03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:54.101]  You tell the facts as you know them at the time.
[03:24:54.541 --> 03:24:55.181]  You speculate.
[03:24:55.461 --> 03:24:57.042]  You interpolate.
[03:24:57.062 --> 03:24:57.682]  You interpret.
[03:24:58.459 --> 03:25:00.400]  You do the best you can with what you have available at the time.
[03:25:01.361 --> 03:25:16.589]  The difference, though, between Breitbart and Infowars and whatever, as far as I can see it, is that they do the best job, we all do the best job, when you're watching the Milo Show, whatever, we all do the best job of telling you what's happening as best we see it.
[03:25:17.450 --> 03:25:25.875]  That pales in comparison to the deliberate outright mendacity of the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN, who pose as neutral
[03:25:27.338 --> 03:25:44.989]  And through their haughty moral grandstanding, presumed to pass judgment on people who make far fewer mistakes than they do, and who do so with the best of intentions and with good hearts in service of freedom and freedom of speech and the protection of American liberties, and who do not...
[03:25:45.714 --> 03:25:46.935]  That's an outright lie!
[03:25:47.776 --> 03:25:49.678]  CNN has been caught in so many outright lies.
[03:25:49.958 --> 03:26:08.254]  And you see in this guy's response, the canned, prepared remarks of somebody who is more interested in moral grandstanding, much more interested in pandering to whoever the women were behind him, than he is in engaging in debate.
[03:26:08.274 --> 03:26:09.855]  And he walks away, but he can't resist.
[03:26:10.216 --> 03:26:11.457]  He cannot help himself.
[03:26:12.878 --> 03:26:18.462]  But get drawn further in, so he can issue further exhortations of moral grandstanding.
[03:26:18.742 --> 03:26:24.185]  Let's let him carry on, because you know, unlike their side, we like letting people have their say.
[03:26:24.646 --> 03:26:33.812]  We enjoy giving people a platform they deny to others, mostly because they tend to fall straight off it and into the dirt, break their noses when given the platform.
[03:26:34.352 --> 03:26:35.673]  We don't shy away from debate.
[03:26:35.913 --> 03:26:38.855]  We encourage, warmly encourage
[03:26:40.609 --> 03:26:41.469]  Classical liberalism.
[03:26:42.410 --> 03:26:45.031]  The open marketplace of ideas.
[03:26:45.551 --> 03:26:53.774]  Even if liberals misuse it to bully, intimidate, harass, smear and demean instead of bringing facts, reason and logic.
[03:26:53.914 --> 03:26:55.575]  But let's let this guy go on.
[03:26:55.675 --> 03:26:58.336]  One of the things I like about Laura is how dogged she is.
[03:26:58.356 --> 03:27:00.276]  She won't let the guy go.
[03:27:00.316 --> 03:27:00.957]  She's got his trouser leg.
[03:27:00.997 --> 03:27:01.317]  Carry on.
[03:27:07.631 --> 03:27:08.833]  That Sandy Hook was a hoax.
[03:27:08.873 --> 03:27:10.214]  We're not talking about Sandy Hook.
[03:27:10.234 --> 03:27:15.681]  We're talking about you lying on stage telling your constituents right now that you're calling them assault weapons.
[03:27:15.921 --> 03:27:17.022]  You're telling them, you lied to them.
[03:27:17.042 --> 03:27:17.943]  You said that they were banned in 2004.
[03:27:18.104 --> 03:27:19.846]  The guns were not banned.
[03:27:19.886 --> 03:27:22.148]  What was banned were the suppressors and the accessories.
[03:27:22.169 --> 03:27:24.371]  So why are you lying to your constituents to push gun control?
[03:27:24.391 --> 03:27:25.332]  Here's what I'm telling you.
[03:27:26.313 --> 03:27:35.161]  That every Republican I know thinks that your efforts to characterize Sandy Hook as a hoax... We're not talking about Sandy Hook, Congressman.
[03:27:35.181 --> 03:27:36.882]  We're talking about the shooting in Parkland.
[03:27:36.902 --> 03:27:40.785]  Because you come to my community... And you taking this tragedy to push for gun control?
[03:27:40.806 --> 03:27:43.228]  What does this have to do with FBI incompetence, Congressman?
[03:27:43.248 --> 03:27:47.371]  If you're going to listen to me, you coming to my community, where we just experienced... I'm a journalist.
[03:27:47.391 --> 03:27:48.792]  I have a right to ask you a question.
[03:27:48.812 --> 03:27:50.073]  And as a public official, you have to answer me.
[03:27:50.113 --> 03:27:54.197]  Where we just experienced the worst, most horrific shooting in a school
[03:27:54.537 --> 03:27:55.798]  That'll probably do.
[03:27:55.878 --> 03:28:05.004]  I think what, you know, what tends to happen, the dynamic of this is, for instance with Breitbart, I think it's something called, it's Acorn, which predates my time at Breitbart.
[03:28:05.024 --> 03:28:06.024]  I was at Breitbart for a little while.
[03:28:07.065 --> 03:28:16.811]  There's that one iconic thing that people are upset at you about, that they just sort of bang on and on and on and use it as an excuse to not answer questions, to not address the facts.
[03:28:17.332 --> 03:28:23.636]  And it's like Breitbart always gets so much stuff for Acorn, and it is by no means clear
[03:28:24.747 --> 03:28:28.911]  At all, who is in the right with the question of ACORN.
[03:28:28.951 --> 03:28:41.743]  And it is absolutely true, which is, you know, when Alex says on this show that there is something weird about the way the media covers up and the bulldozing of buildings after these shootings, there is something weird about it.
[03:28:41.823 --> 03:28:44.185]  And it is new and it's hardly surprising people ask questions.
[03:28:44.225 --> 03:28:48.028]  And when the FBI covers up what's going on, doesn't tell people what's happening,
[03:28:48.849 --> 03:28:53.259]  And the media is remarkably incurious about the motivations of people after these things.
[03:28:53.419 --> 03:28:55.604]  It is weird, and it's hardly surprising people ask questions.
[03:28:55.624 --> 03:28:59.492]  And after the break, we'll have Laura Loomer on a Vibe video, so we'll be right back.
[03:29:03.772 --> 03:29:08.695]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[03:29:09.476 --> 03:29:12.398]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[03:29:13.078 --> 03:29:15.880]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[03:29:16.501 --> 03:29:21.384]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[03:29:21.744 --> 03:29:28.048]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[03:29:28.408 --> 03:29:33.572]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[03:29:34.232 --> 03:29:37.653]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[03:29:38.233 --> 03:29:46.056]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[03:29:46.636 --> 03:29:50.957]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[03:29:51.298 --> 03:29:55.239]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[03:29:55.539 --> 03:29:59.360]  Stay in the game with Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.

[03:30:08.669 --> 03:30:13.973]  My good friend, I've gotten to know him really well over the years, knew his dad before I even knew him, Mike Norris is here with us in the studio.
[03:30:13.993 --> 03:30:16.915]  He's got a new film we'll talk about in the next segment, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[03:30:17.315 --> 03:30:27.582]  Hollywood free, made in Texas, funded in Texas, and then of course the big films you produced for Hollywood, but also for cable television, Lifetime, Hallmark, you name it.
[03:30:28.163 --> 03:30:32.746]  Very successful, but now you've got The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde sitting back, the state of the world,
[03:30:33.386 --> 03:30:39.709]  I mean, I don't think we've turned the tide yet, but man, there was really nobody fighting back except a few folks before.
[03:30:40.049 --> 03:30:41.450]  The world has really changed.
[03:30:41.510 --> 03:30:45.451]  What period in time do you think we're in right now, Mike Norris?
[03:30:46.192 --> 03:30:47.432]  We're in the greatest time ever.
[03:30:47.452 --> 03:30:49.993]  I mean, we're making America great again.
[03:30:50.354 --> 03:30:54.675]  We've got great people around just speaking the truth everywhere.
[03:30:55.096 --> 03:30:56.816]  And I think the elites are going down.
[03:30:57.337 --> 03:31:00.118]  And I think this is such an exciting time.
[03:31:00.138 --> 03:31:01.258]  And I'm happy to be alive.
[03:31:01.318 --> 03:31:02.519]  I'm proud to witness it.
[03:31:03.817 --> 03:31:04.918]  Making America great again.
[03:31:05.218 --> 03:31:09.041]  You've made films about the globalists, the New World Order, you've been speaking about it for decades, fighting it.
[03:31:10.582 --> 03:31:13.664]  This is super positive, but they are striking back.
[03:31:14.004 --> 03:31:14.885]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:31:14.905 --> 03:31:20.269]  And the thing with this film, Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, after we did America, and that was such a large film, it took
[03:31:20.709 --> 03:31:21.970]  A long time, big budget.
[03:31:22.330 --> 03:31:38.819]  What I wanted to do was kind of strip everything down and really get into a story about what would the world look like if civil war actually took place, everybody factioned up, and a spiritual warfare broke out within our country.
[03:31:39.139 --> 03:31:39.960]  And that's already happened!
[03:31:40.320 --> 03:31:41.400]  It's starting, it's starting.
[03:31:41.440 --> 03:31:49.363]  But you know, a lot of it had to do with the way you were talking years ago about the demonic entities of not only Hollywood, but the government, everything.
[03:31:50.043 --> 03:31:52.163]  Hey, if there's a God, there's a devil.
[03:31:52.744 --> 03:31:55.884]  And the devil is after believers all over the country.
[03:31:56.025 --> 03:32:01.506]  And we've got to be prepared and we've got to be ready to fight for our faith, for our country, for everything.
[03:32:01.786 --> 03:32:03.887]  But that's the thing with Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[03:32:03.967 --> 03:32:08.028]  It deals with the spiritual battle that can take place within us.
[03:32:08.308 --> 03:32:13.511]  And we've got all the public statements by Antifa about rising up, taking over, triggering something for martial law.
[03:32:14.312 --> 03:32:15.853]  This is really what they're pushing.
[03:32:15.873 --> 03:32:19.175]  So a very, very timely, timely film.
[03:32:19.936 --> 03:32:25.319]  When you see them failing, though, on every front, when you see Soros starting to fail, what do you think they're going to do next?
[03:32:25.339 --> 03:32:26.720]  They're not going to give up.
[03:32:26.800 --> 03:32:28.701]  You know, Alex, I wish I knew.
[03:32:28.721 --> 03:32:30.963]  I really wish I knew what they were going to do.
[03:32:31.003 --> 03:32:31.823]  They're not going to give up.
[03:32:33.384 --> 03:32:45.234]  I'm a little nervous to see, you know, what the millennials, so to say, you know, I think they're so brainwashed that they will follow anything without any thought to it.
[03:32:45.574 --> 03:32:51.239]  So, a little curious to see what happens with them, but you know what?
[03:32:51.279 --> 03:32:53.440]  We're going to kick their butts everywhere.
[03:32:53.861 --> 03:32:55.162]  We're going to beat them, Alex.
[03:32:55.442 --> 03:32:57.504]  We are going to win this battle.
[03:33:06.349 --> 03:33:09.111]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.397 --> 03:33:25.843]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[03:33:25.863 --> 03:33:29.126]  He is Alex Jones.
[03:33:32.560 --> 03:33:36.222]  This is Milo Yiannopoulos filling in for Alex Jones.
[03:33:36.562 --> 03:33:38.683]  And if you'd like to speak to me, you can call us.
[03:33:39.383 --> 03:33:40.424]  Call the number right now.

[03:34:17.594 --> 03:34:35.152]  Infowars would also like me to let you know that for a limited time only, and the sale's ending soon, Super Blue products, which are Infowars' best-selling line of products, or one of the best-selling lines of products, fortified with colloidal silver and iodine to give you a fluoride-free smile.
[03:34:35.733 --> 03:34:37.515]  We've been worried about what they're putting in the water.
[03:34:37.535 --> 03:34:38.275]  These are for you.
[03:34:39.056 --> 03:34:41.499]  We're going to have to take the sale down in a few days.
[03:34:41.779 --> 03:34:42.620]  They want me to let you know.
[03:34:42.800 --> 03:34:43.661]  And they're almost sold out.
[03:34:43.721 --> 03:34:46.644]  It'll be at least a month before we can get Superblue back at its low price.
[03:34:47.044 --> 03:34:48.466]  So there's no time to wait.

[03:35:20.574 --> 03:35:21.195]  Let's move on.
[03:35:21.215 --> 03:35:25.619]  We've seen her video, the dogged determination of the most hated woman on the internet.
[03:35:27.008 --> 03:35:27.388]  Not really.
[03:35:27.889 --> 03:35:34.433]  But you do have a hell of a troll army after you, for which I can only congratulate you.
[03:35:35.114 --> 03:35:35.474]  Well done.
[03:35:35.494 --> 03:35:36.635]  You're obviously doing something right.
[03:35:36.735 --> 03:35:43.059]  Laura Loomer, who is up there, the intrepid, indefatigable, unstoppable bloodhound.
[03:35:43.659 --> 03:35:48.303]  Laura Loomer, up there in Florida, nosing around.
[03:35:48.523 --> 03:35:51.845]  And we have some news to break on the show.
[03:35:52.626 --> 03:35:53.886]  You've lost your Twitter account.
[03:35:54.087 --> 03:35:54.547]  What happened?
[03:35:56.007 --> 03:36:06.409]  Well, yesterday I confronted Congressman Ted Deutch, who's a Democrat and anti-gun proponent here in Florida, who's really just taking advantage of this tragedy, really, to promote his own agenda.
[03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:09.670]  And I confronted him at a gun-grabber meeting.
[03:36:09.970 --> 03:36:17.712]  And then when I posted the video on my Twitter, along with InfoWars, I received a message this morning saying that I had a seven-day ban on my Twitter.
[03:36:18.212 --> 03:36:26.599]  So, I can't put out all of this information, and I feel like they're really trying to just, like, limit my expose of what's taking place here in Florida.
[03:36:26.639 --> 03:36:40.051]  Because not only do you have Democrats pushing gun control, but you have the media organizations like CNN actively coaching these students, whose parents are tied to globalist organizations like the FBI, for example, and they're giving them talking points.
[03:36:40.611 --> 03:36:46.036]  And it's a lot of these left-wing corporations and media companies, including Twitter, who are in on this.
[03:36:46.636 --> 03:36:47.597]  It's the teachers, too.
[03:36:48.777 --> 03:36:58.823]  You told me before we came on air in the last break that one of the teachers at the school is potentially getting himself into trouble by telling students to show up at things.
[03:36:59.123 --> 03:36:59.784]  Tell us about that.
[03:37:00.584 --> 03:37:05.827]  Well, I doubt she'll get in trouble because, you know, it doesn't really seem like they're willing to hold people accountable anywhere here in Florida.
[03:37:05.847 --> 03:37:06.648]  If it were a just world.
[03:37:08.455 --> 03:37:15.220]  But there's an individual by the name of Sarah Lerner, and she's a journalism and English teacher at the high school here in Parkland, Florida.
[03:37:15.660 --> 03:37:21.784]  And she's violating the Florida Code of Conduct for teachers by texting students on their personal cell phone number.
[03:37:21.844 --> 03:37:23.365]  I mean, that's a really big no-no.
[03:37:23.405 --> 03:37:29.430]  In the era of, like, teacher sex scandals, you're not supposed to be texting students on their personal cell phone numbers.
[03:37:29.790 --> 03:37:32.232]  Is he getting those numbers from their, like,
[03:37:33.652 --> 03:37:35.475]  Confidential student records?
[03:37:35.855 --> 03:37:41.884]  Yes, I believe so because a lot of students are receiving different numbers from different, different text messages from different teachers.
[03:37:41.944 --> 03:37:45.849]  Who shares their phone number with their teacher when they're like 11 years old or something?
[03:37:45.869 --> 03:37:49.455]  You don't give your, you don't give your cell phone number to your science teacher?
[03:37:50.367 --> 03:37:56.713]  That's the other point of what I was going to bring up is our taxpayer dollars go towards funding these public schools in Florida.
[03:37:57.293 --> 03:38:06.982]  And the fact that those records are supposed to be confidential and they're now being used and harvested by these very liberal anti-Trump teachers who are using it to push gun control.
[03:38:07.042 --> 03:38:10.304]  I mean, that's, that's a, I think the school deserves to be investigated.
[03:38:10.625 --> 03:38:16.350]  I think that the school deserves to be investigated because at this point in time, they're, they're, they're leaking confidential information about students.
[03:38:17.307 --> 03:38:25.895]  What has upset me, and I take a disinterested perspective on many things, but I don't have children myself, but I'm not a monster.
[03:38:26.715 --> 03:38:39.046]  And my husband has as a kid, and what makes me horrified now that I have that presence in my extended family, you know, like a kid that
[03:38:39.858 --> 03:38:40.118]  You have
[03:38:58.518 --> 03:39:02.381]  And this is, you know, the perfect storm for them in a way.
[03:39:02.881 --> 03:39:16.011]  You came on my show earlier this week and suggested, not that the FBI had a hand in this, because of course they didn't, but that there might be a reason why authorities in different branches of government are perhaps not
[03:39:18.368 --> 03:39:20.490]  Proactively getting these people off the streets.
[03:39:20.590 --> 03:39:24.835]  I mean, this guy, was it 39 times the cops were called to his house?
[03:39:25.676 --> 03:39:28.579]  The FBI knew about him, but they didn't stop him from doing this.
[03:39:28.679 --> 03:39:32.543]  Now, nobody's saying that they knew when and where and how it was going to go down.
[03:39:33.985 --> 03:39:38.569]  But they knew about him, and they presumably could have done something to make people around him safer.
[03:39:39.522 --> 03:39:39.982]  And they didn't.
[03:39:40.362 --> 03:39:46.904]  Talk to us about why you think, is it, well, is there an incentive, is there a reason why the FBI is not doing so?
[03:39:47.244 --> 03:39:52.545]  Is there a reason why the FBI is not getting these people the treatment they need?
[03:39:52.805 --> 03:39:57.906]  Or just incarcerating them when they're found in school with like bullets, you know?
[03:39:58.747 --> 03:40:01.527]  What's that, what is the FBI thinking?
[03:40:01.647 --> 03:40:05.288]  Like not actively and enthusiastically investigating this stuff?
[03:40:05.308 --> 03:40:08.129]  Are they really just all tied up with this bogus Russia investigation?
[03:40:08.329 --> 03:40:09.109]  What is happening over there?
[03:40:10.276 --> 03:40:11.837]  Well, I think there's two things that's happening.
[03:40:11.877 --> 03:40:16.321]  I think that they're too busy having affairs and sleeping with people who aren't their husbands or wives.
[03:40:16.842 --> 03:40:26.790]  And I think that they're too busy texting people and accusing Trump of being involved in Russia and all of this nonsense that we've seen taking place at the FBI over the past year or two.
[03:40:27.210 --> 03:40:35.796]  But the thing that's more concerning and most disturbing to me, in my opinion, is the fact that this is a pattern, right?
[03:40:35.896 --> 03:40:38.177]  We see it with the Fort Hood shooter.
[03:40:38.237 --> 03:40:41.560]  We saw it with the terrorists who shot up the gay club in Orlando.
[03:40:41.900 --> 03:40:46.063]  We saw it with, you know, just San Bernardino, right?
[03:40:46.103 --> 03:40:56.570]  You can go through this list of terrorists and mass shooters throughout the past year or two, and the commonality is that they were all known by the FBI prior to committing their attacks or
[03:40:57.230 --> 03:41:20.102]  So, I personally wonder if the FBI has some type of benefit being the propaganda arm for the Democratic Party that they have become and proven themselves to be by not taking out these threats to society so that when they do commit acts of violence with guns, the Democrats can immediately politicize the tragedy and call for gun control.
[03:41:20.342 --> 03:41:31.367]  Even though the FBI is probably working hand-in-hand with the Democratic Party, as we've seen, on more than just one issue besides, you know, targeting Trump and committing treason against our Commander-in-Chief.
[03:41:32.828 --> 03:41:34.629]  Laura Loomer up there in Florida.
[03:41:34.649 --> 03:41:35.849]  Thank you for joining us, Laura.
[03:41:36.350 --> 03:41:39.191]  This does seem to be part of a... I have a...
[03:41:40.623 --> 03:41:49.027]  Little saying on my show that Alex Jones just keeps getting proven right to the consternation and confusion and fury of liberals everywhere.
[03:41:49.508 --> 03:41:57.292]  Whether it's gay frogs and it turns out actually amphibians do go trans or agender with particular chemicals in the water.
[03:41:57.572 --> 03:42:00.093]  Daily Mail reported that and I mentioned that last time I was on this show.
[03:42:00.734 --> 03:42:05.296]  Or it's the skepticism with which he has always regarded the intelligence community.
[03:42:05.356 --> 03:42:06.417]  Now it seems that that
[03:42:07.449 --> 03:42:15.411]  A healthy sense of critical distance is rippling out among the public at large.
[03:42:15.711 --> 03:42:29.495]  It seems to me that the big trend of 2018, the red thread running through this year's news reports and the big development is not going to be Me Too or Hollywood, but rather
[03:42:31.018 --> 03:42:42.743]  An increasing skepticism and even hatred of our own intelligence agencies, which is going to make America a very difficult place to govern and a very dangerous place to live.
[03:42:42.763 --> 03:42:46.404]  877-789-2539 if you want to talk to me after this segment, the show's almost over today.
[03:42:46.424 --> 03:42:48.365]  I'm sorry to tell you, we're running out of time.

[03:43:13.325 --> 03:43:19.653]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:43:21.355 --> 03:43:27.699]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[03:44:59.439 --> 03:44:59.779]  Just briefly,
[03:45:13.647 --> 03:45:15.648]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:45:15.688 --> 03:45:16.549]  He's about to retire.
[03:45:16.569 --> 03:45:23.654]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[03:45:23.674 --> 03:45:26.676]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[03:45:26.696 --> 03:45:27.697]  That's a bunch of bull.
[03:45:28.197 --> 03:45:29.278]  You need fluoride or you die.
[03:45:29.838 --> 03:45:32.320]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[03:45:32.340 --> 03:45:33.120]  He said, this is incredible.
[03:45:33.540 --> 03:45:35.522]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[03:45:35.562 --> 03:45:41.446]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[03:45:42.046 --> 03:45:42.506]  Exactly.
[03:45:42.566 --> 03:45:48.548]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[03:45:48.609 --> 03:45:52.390]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:57.292]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[03:45:58.388 --> 03:46:00.509]  Hopped up version of fluoride.
[03:46:00.709 --> 03:46:01.729]  It's been turned into an acid.
[03:46:02.230 --> 03:46:03.010]  It's an adjuvant.
[03:46:03.050 --> 03:46:03.730]  It's very toxic.
[03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:12.634]  But there is the CNN headline that fluoride in the water and in toothpaste is causing IQs to drop precipitously.
[03:46:12.974 --> 03:46:14.075]  And for seven years the
[03:46:15.080 --> 03:46:18.622]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[03:46:19.082 --> 03:46:21.524]  Why does it say nursery water than at the store with added fluoride?
[03:46:21.604 --> 03:46:24.506]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[03:46:24.526 --> 03:46:26.507]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:46:26.707 --> 03:46:38.254]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, it's private labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine, which you die without iodine.
[03:46:38.294 --> 03:46:39.815]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[03:46:39.835 --> 03:46:41.636]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[03:46:41.656 --> 03:46:42.597]  That's a different type of iodine.
[03:46:42.617 --> 03:46:44.018]  This is the real medical grade.
[03:46:44.458 --> 03:46:52.761]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[03:46:53.341 --> 03:46:56.722]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[03:47:06.285 --> 03:47:08.886]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.651 --> 03:47:19.873]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:47:20.093 --> 03:47:22.776]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:47:23.297 --> 03:47:25.739]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:28.762]  He's the gentle giant.
[03:47:37.410 --> 03:47:39.091]  He's Uncle Alex to Trump's daddy.
[03:47:39.851 --> 03:47:47.513]  Alex Jones off gallivanting, doing whatever international men of mystery and truth-seeking do.
[03:47:47.533 --> 03:47:49.714]  I am Marlon Oplah standing in for Alex Jones.
[03:47:50.234 --> 03:47:52.435]  Last segment of the last hour of the show.
[03:47:52.455 --> 03:47:56.336]  You'll be just as miserable that I am that it is coming to an end.
[03:47:57.136 --> 03:48:02.998]  And before we take calls, we've got time for a couple of calls, let me remind you about InfoWarsLife's iKurin.
[03:48:03.948 --> 03:48:04.328]  Here we go.
[03:48:04.648 --> 03:48:08.190]  The best endorsement I can give you, because I'm very careful about what I put inside myself.
[03:48:09.050 --> 03:48:11.612]  As many... I won't make that joke, actually.
[03:48:11.652 --> 03:48:12.452]  We go out on the radio, don't we?
[03:48:12.752 --> 03:48:14.093]  Let's do it.
[03:48:17.034 --> 03:48:17.434]  There we go.
[03:48:18.235 --> 03:48:19.395]  Milk Thistle Extract.
[03:48:20.195 --> 03:48:21.776]  600 milligrams of it.
[03:48:22.677 --> 03:48:25.698]  More toxins and diseases find their way into your system.
[03:48:25.718 --> 03:48:29.700]  More important it is that your body's detox systems can keep up in the liver and the kidneys.
[03:48:31.049 --> 03:48:35.336]  Are the ones who bear the brunt of all of your smoking, drinking, and carousing.
[03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:41.043]  Terrible things that you people do to your bodies while you're listening to Infowars.
[03:48:41.343 --> 03:48:44.565]  Guzzling down Jim Bean and chain-smoking.
[03:48:44.705 --> 03:48:54.632]  Well, you can help recover from all of that with some milk thistle extracts and N-acetylcysteine, some amla fruit, bupleurium root, licorice lute.
[03:48:54.872 --> 03:48:59.455]  I had to check because I thought they were making these up because they didn't sound like real things to me, but I've looked them up and they are.
[03:49:00.276 --> 03:49:06.560]  It's like when, you know, you get the yoga hobbyists who will talk to you about acai berries and bibinga roots and things.
[03:49:07.360 --> 03:49:08.121]  They are real things.
[03:49:09.362 --> 03:49:11.984]  Liver and kidneys take care of you, so take care of them.
[03:49:12.845 --> 03:49:18.289]  Icurin, it's a formula that can support your liver in clearing your body dangerous toxins and so on and so forth.
[03:49:18.329 --> 03:49:28.357]  Powerful set of ingredients including milk thistle extract, a clinically studied herbal ingredient proven to support liver function in the body with a complete 30-day liver cleanse.
[03:49:28.858 --> 03:49:33.662]  Pick up one of these, I'll do it myself and I'll report back and let you know how I got on.
[03:49:35.418 --> 03:49:37.179]  This is the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars.
[03:49:37.339 --> 03:49:40.681]  I'm Marley Anopolis standing in for Alex Jones in this last segment.
[03:49:40.721 --> 03:49:42.122]  Thank you to everybody who called in.
[03:49:42.582 --> 03:49:45.324]  We are going to go straight to Joe, who is on the line now.
[03:49:45.804 --> 03:49:50.147]  He wants to talk to us about... What is it you want to talk to us about, Joe?
[03:49:50.187 --> 03:49:50.707]  I can't remember.
[03:49:50.727 --> 03:49:53.549]  SSRI?
[03:49:54.150 --> 03:49:55.050]  Ah, yes, perfect!
[03:49:55.470 --> 03:49:57.151]  Drugging our young boys.
[03:49:57.592 --> 03:49:58.152]  Welcome to the show.
[03:49:58.192 --> 03:49:59.053]  Thank you so much for calling.
[03:49:59.093 --> 03:49:59.593]  How can we help you?
[03:50:00.666 --> 03:50:01.067]  Yes, sir.
[03:50:01.127 --> 03:50:03.469]  I've been listening to the show for a couple years now.
[03:50:03.970 --> 03:50:05.271]  It's definitely got me woke.
[03:50:05.291 --> 03:50:12.659]  I do want to say that being active duty military, we get forced to drink a lot of water.
[03:50:13.260 --> 03:50:13.480]  Yes.
[03:50:13.560 --> 03:50:18.466]  And drinking fluoridated water has definitely had an impact on my health.
[03:50:18.546 --> 03:50:22.010]  But as soon as I switched to the Alexa Pures, I've got two of them right now.
[03:50:22.922 --> 03:50:24.243]  And I've never felt better.
[03:50:24.664 --> 03:50:25.785]  My water is very pure.
[03:50:25.805 --> 03:50:27.767]  It makes your whole body feel good.
[03:50:28.367 --> 03:50:31.771]  And I'm a big, big fan of all the InfoWars Life products I have.
[03:50:32.409 --> 03:50:43.693]  I've tried the Carnivore, the Whey Protein, the Brain Force, definitely the X2, and I've never run into a product that I had any problems with or was not very, very high standard.
[03:50:43.993 --> 03:50:45.053]  Well, there we go.
[03:50:45.514 --> 03:50:49.715]  Much higher and more powerful and more persuasive endorsement than mine.
[03:50:50.075 --> 03:50:50.435]  There we go.
[03:50:51.656 --> 03:50:52.316]  Active duty.
[03:50:52.336 --> 03:50:53.136]  Thank you very much for that.
[03:50:53.176 --> 03:50:58.278]  Talk to us about, we're running out of time in this final segment, so talk to us a little bit about drug and kids.
[03:50:59.281 --> 03:51:00.482]  I'll try to be quick, sir.
[03:51:00.502 --> 03:51:01.163]  Thank you.
[03:51:01.183 --> 03:51:03.805]  We're all big fans of yours and my work center.
[03:51:04.405 --> 03:51:10.110]  So you've got all these mass shootings and every single time there's a common thread, it's SSRIs.
[03:51:10.590 --> 03:51:15.614]  But nobody with any power is trying to change this except the right.
[03:51:15.974 --> 03:51:23.921]  The left is more than happy to just let this continue and let all the drugged out people eventually snap, which is what these drugs are doing.
[03:51:24.481 --> 03:51:25.742]  It does seem to be the case, doesn't it?
[03:51:25.822 --> 03:51:37.928]  It does seem to be the case that these drugs are having unforeseen effects on young men who at some point suddenly start losing it a little bit and commit these terrible acts.
[03:51:38.248 --> 03:51:46.452]  You must have noticed from being in the armed forces this culture-wide suppression and demonization of masculinity.
[03:51:46.932 --> 03:51:57.454]  Masculinity being that essential quality that not only keeps us safe, that is essential to the proper functioning of the armed forces, of law enforcement and everything else, but also drives us to excel, drives us to explore, drives us to invent.
[03:51:57.894 --> 03:52:01.455]  Properly channeled and respected and appreciated and enjoyed.
[03:52:01.815 --> 03:52:07.416]  Men are wonderful and men and women different, complementary, equally fantastic in their own ways.
[03:52:08.017 --> 03:52:09.517]  You must be frustrated.
[03:52:10.017 --> 03:52:18.264]  With the constant demonization of men in culture, and it finds its highest expression in the hatred of the military and of law enforcement from the left.
[03:52:18.284 --> 03:52:19.845]  Have you seen that happen over the last few years?
[03:52:19.885 --> 03:52:23.888]  People sort of constantly bashing the very men who keep us safe?
[03:52:25.510 --> 03:52:30.774]  Yeah, there's definitely, I think, this demonization of the manly cut figure.
[03:52:31.114 --> 03:52:33.336]  You know, the old-fashioned kind of Clint Eastwood.
[03:52:33.756 --> 03:52:35.798]  Just strong, tough, strong, silent type.
[03:52:36.235 --> 03:53:03.274]  I don't see that anymore, and if you're like that, the left and the liberals demonize it like it's a thing of the past, it's a dinosaur, they want it to die so that we can open the borders and bring in Islamic radical terrorists and we can throw our Second Amendment down the drain and be completely disarmed when the government goes full 1984 and wants to infringe on our very rights that the founding fathers gave us.
[03:53:03.294 --> 03:53:04.755]  And they always want to throw out this argument.
[03:53:06.046 --> 03:53:07.387]  Oh yeah, well they had muskets.
[03:53:07.787 --> 03:53:08.648]  They had muskets.
[03:53:09.028 --> 03:53:11.610]  Well, yeah, they didn't have automatic weapons.
[03:53:11.690 --> 03:53:13.011]  Well, we don't have automatic weapons.
[03:53:13.471 --> 03:53:17.434]  No, and you know if you're a woman in a Chicago or a Detroit or a St.
[03:53:17.454 --> 03:53:23.699]  Louis suburb and you're worried about getting raped or mugged or attacked or whatever, you want a pistol in your handbag, let me tell you.
[03:53:24.379 --> 03:53:39.607]  If you are somebody living in one of those areas, or if you just are a patriot who is worried about the tyranny of government, which is a sincere opinion held by a hundred million Americans that liberals seem to find ridiculous, this is just as emotional as a rational...
[03:53:39.827 --> 03:53:42.548]  As it is a rational argument for supporters of the Second Amendment.
[03:53:43.148 --> 03:53:43.708]  Perfectly reasonable.
[03:53:43.908 --> 03:53:44.749]  Thank you for your call, Joe.
[03:53:44.789 --> 03:53:46.749]  Sorry we don't have more time, but thank you very much for calling in.
[03:53:46.769 --> 03:53:47.449]  Thank you for the compliments.
[03:53:47.469 --> 03:53:50.010]  Thank you for the excellent endorsement of the products.
[03:53:50.110 --> 03:53:50.570]  There we go.
[03:53:50.910 --> 03:53:55.132]  Somebody out there fighting for your freedoms is a fan of InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:53:55.172 --> 03:54:00.053]  Moving swiftly on to Scott, who wants to talk to us about the trans issue, I think.
[03:54:00.113 --> 03:54:00.673]  Scott, are you there?
[03:54:01.414 --> 03:54:02.274]  Yes, I'm here.
[03:54:02.514 --> 03:54:03.394]  How are you doing, Pumpkin?
[03:54:04.154 --> 03:54:04.755]  Oh, good.
[03:54:05.315 --> 03:54:07.795]  And I really enjoy listening to you.
[03:54:07.835 --> 03:54:08.436]  You're great.
[03:54:08.796 --> 03:54:09.276]  Oh, well, thank you.
[03:54:09.953 --> 03:54:15.321]  And so anyway, I went through a sex resignment surgery.
[03:54:15.341 --> 03:54:16.343]  Oh wow.
[03:54:16.703 --> 03:54:18.506]  From male to female.
[03:54:19.507 --> 03:54:25.776]  And I got tired of being called the bee from hell, so I went back to my birth name and went back to male.
[03:54:26.568 --> 03:54:30.553]  Oh wow, so you went there and back again, as Tolkien would say.
[03:54:30.573 --> 03:54:41.426]  You are an example of what I've seen increasing number of studies show, which is the regret rates for transition surgery, for reassignment surgery are remarkably high.
[03:54:42.567 --> 03:54:54.816]  What is it you'd like to say to people who are out there defending, you know, teachers and educators and scientists who want to put kids on hormone blockers and talk about removing the genitalia of young boys?
[03:54:54.856 --> 03:55:01.121]  What would you say, just quickly, because we've got to run, I would love to have spoken to you for longer, but we've got to run to the next call.
[03:55:01.161 --> 03:55:08.167]  What would you say to those teachers, to the journalists, to the scientists, all these people who are advocating for this
[03:55:14.371 --> 03:55:15.491]  Don't do it.
[03:55:16.592 --> 03:55:17.892]  I'm 59 years old.
[03:55:19.313 --> 03:55:25.016]  I've got the bone structure of a 90-year-old because of lack of hormones in my body.
[03:55:26.337 --> 03:55:38.223]  And the other thing is, as far as the issue with the school shootings and whatnot, and I am a staunch conservative, just like you.
[03:55:39.371 --> 03:55:42.934]  And we need to arm up our teachers.
[03:55:43.895 --> 03:55:44.656]  Absolutely.
[03:55:44.776 --> 03:55:45.496]  Thank you for the call.
[03:55:45.616 --> 03:55:46.297]  Thank you so much.
[03:55:46.337 --> 03:55:47.598]  I'm so sorry we didn't have more time.
[03:55:47.618 --> 03:55:48.999]  I'm very grateful for your calling.
[03:55:49.459 --> 03:55:49.860]  Thank you.
[03:55:50.440 --> 03:55:53.903]  Finally, Lauren is a regular caller.
[03:55:53.943 --> 03:55:55.604]  We have literally 60 seconds.
[03:55:55.664 --> 03:55:57.166]  Lauren, thank you so much for calling in.
[03:55:57.306 --> 03:55:57.686]  Welcome.
[03:55:57.966 --> 03:55:59.087]  Thank you for calling.
[03:55:59.147 --> 03:56:01.449]  I know you're a regular caller, so people are going to get to hear from you again.
[03:56:01.729 --> 03:56:03.250]  I'm so sorry we're incredibly short of time.
[03:56:04.051 --> 03:56:04.992]  Give us your quick 60 seconds of wisdom.
[03:56:06.989 --> 03:56:07.830]  60 seconds, I can do it.
[03:56:07.850 --> 03:56:09.671]  I'll stick with the school situation.
[03:56:09.691 --> 03:56:10.551]  I ran for state school board.
[03:56:10.591 --> 03:56:10.971]  I was there.
[03:56:10.991 --> 03:56:11.592]  I watched them.
[03:56:11.612 --> 03:56:13.893]  They are dumbing down your children on purpose.
[03:56:13.933 --> 03:56:15.734]  You know, deliberate dumbing down Charlotte Isserby.
[03:56:16.234 --> 03:56:17.835]  And none of this would be happening.
[03:56:17.935 --> 03:56:22.337]  How do you have three generations of lefties that don't understand guns is what made this country free?
[03:56:22.998 --> 03:56:24.419]  I mean, it's only been 200 years.
[03:56:24.579 --> 03:56:26.720]  You really don't understand that you need to defend yourself?
[03:56:26.760 --> 03:56:27.400]  Are you kidding me?
[03:56:27.620 --> 03:56:34.844]  Are you suggesting, Lauren, that evidence, fact, reason, logic, and history have no effect on social justice warriors?
[03:56:35.144 --> 03:56:36.005]  You do surprise me.
[03:56:38.442 --> 03:56:38.542]  Amen.
[03:56:38.602 --> 03:56:39.382]  Thank you so much.
[03:56:39.443 --> 03:56:40.883]  Thank you, Lauren, and thank you for the call.
[03:56:40.903 --> 03:56:41.844]  Sorry we don't have more time.
[03:57:03.715 --> 03:57:07.118]  Well, we didn't get to any of the things I... Well, actually, we got to some of the things I wanted to do.
[03:57:07.178 --> 03:57:10.020]  We got to one thing that we might return to tomorrow.
[03:57:10.160 --> 03:57:11.001]  Yes, that's right.
[03:57:11.041 --> 03:57:11.842]  I'll be back tomorrow.
[03:57:12.782 --> 03:57:19.428]  Is Michael Moore showing up to a Russia-funded anti-Trump protest.
[03:57:19.808 --> 03:57:20.909]  You couldn't make it up.
[03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:22.971]  Literally, you couldn't make it up.
[03:57:24.266 --> 03:57:27.868]  I'm Marlonopoulos, and you have been watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:27.948 --> 03:57:29.369]  I'll be back again tomorrow.
[03:57:29.449 --> 03:57:31.371]  You can find me at Dangerous.com.
[03:57:31.651 --> 03:57:37.374]  My pink-flushed InfoWars studio will return tomorrow.
[03:57:37.435 --> 03:57:38.675]  Thank you so much for watching.
[03:57:38.775 --> 03:57:40.737]  Thank you for your freedoms.
[03:57:41.977 --> 03:57:45.500]  Thank you for being watchers.
[03:57:45.600 --> 03:57:46.060]  You're great.
[03:57:46.260 --> 03:57:46.901]  I love you.
[03:57:46.941 --> 03:57:47.381]  See you tomorrow.
[03:57:47.461 --> 03:57:48.822]  Thanks so much, everybody, and good night.
[03:57:52.461 --> 03:58:03.987]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[03:58:04.027 --> 03:58:04.988]  We're exposed to lead.
[03:58:05.028 --> 03:58:06.048]  We're exposed to mercury.
[03:58:06.088 --> 03:58:11.071]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[03:58:11.451 --> 03:58:16.474]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[03:58:16.574 --> 03:58:18.695]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[03:58:19.475 --> 03:58:20.876]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[03:58:20.997 --> 03:58:24.620]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[03:58:24.720 --> 03:58:29.724]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[03:58:30.084 --> 03:58:35.549]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[03:58:35.929 --> 03:58:41.154]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[03:58:41.514 --> 03:58:42.415]  And over and over again.
