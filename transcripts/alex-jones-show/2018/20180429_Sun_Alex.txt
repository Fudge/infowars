[00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:19.415]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:21.339]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.872]  Wow, we have got a lot to report to you on this worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:33.414]  Thank you for joining us on the 29th day of April 2018 for the Sunday Transmission.
[00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:36.756]  We'll be here as we are every Sunday, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:38.156]  ahead of the weekday broadcast.
[00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:45.840]  Myself, Owens Troyer, David Knight, and others, 10 hours a day, live now, from the InfoWars network that the establishment is trying to take down.
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.481]  Well, Mr. Clapper,
[00:00:49.775 --> 00:01:04.980]  Former National Director of Intelligence, who also headed up the NSA previous to that, testified to Congress four years ago that he had never, and the NSA had never, spied on anyone in the United States, period.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.162]  Now that was a 1,000% total, complete lie.
[00:01:10.462 --> 00:01:16.004]  The statute of limitations just expired on perjuring yourself to Congress.
[00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:16.804]  It's actually five years.
[00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:17.705]  I said four.
[00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:18.465]  It's been five years.
[00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:20.142]  He did it again.
[00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:22.704]  He testified to Congress.
[00:01:22.804 --> 00:01:28.227]  There's an excellent Zero Hedge article up on Infowars.com, but also even The Hill and others have picked it up.
[00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:29.748]  Jack Mosobik did a great breakdown.
[00:01:29.768 --> 00:01:38.293]  We should get Jack on the next few days of this whole situation, but he testified that he was never the source.
[00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.054]  We even have a Don Lemon video that's in the folder.
[00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:43.074]  I forgot to tell you guys about it.
[00:01:43.094 --> 00:01:43.935]  It's like two minutes long.
[00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:47.137]  Or even Don Lemon grills him and goes, but you are the source.
[00:01:47.997 --> 00:01:49.598]  You told CNN you were the source.
[00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:51.279]  Now he works for CNN.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.882]  So when Don Lemon's saying you're a liar, I mean, that's like Pinocchio saying you're a liar.
[00:01:55.902 --> 00:01:59.665]  I mean, you got a serious problem when Pinocchio even thinks you're bad.
[00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:03.087]  The arrogant Pinocchio that is Don Lemon.
[00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.290]  Because CNN knows he's the source.
[00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:15.973]  He's bragged he was the source, back when he was so arrogant, back when his counterpart of the CIA, Brennan, was saying stuff like, watch your mouth.
[00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:22.335]  So Trump has ripped the lying machine James Clapper over leaks to CNN.
[00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:31.138]  And the articles on Infowars, both from Infowars and Zero Hedge, just chronicle video clips of him
[00:02:32.768 --> 00:02:45.573]  In 2017, on CNN, right as the President's being inaugurated, saying, you know, that he saw the info, he leaked the info, and we've got him testifying to Congress, months later, he didn't.
[00:02:45.653 --> 00:02:50.795]  It's like, these people have Alzheimer's or something, or they don't think we're paying attention.
[00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:56.217]  Well, we are, Clapper, and Brennan, and all the rest of you.
[00:02:56.237 --> 00:02:58.598]  So those clips are coming up later in the hour.
[00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:03.167]  But sometimes something happens that really illustrates everything.
[00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:24.457]  And a big thing that we have to really dig into today is the whole situation with the White House Correspondents Dinner that transpired over the weekend and the abject insane asylum level arrogance that even has mainstream media saying this completely flopped.
[00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:27.158]  But it gets better coming up.
[00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:42.570]  CNN was given an award at the press dinner for the Steele dossier reporting, which was illegal leaks and fake, and been proven to be a fraud, and they think you're so dumb, you think, is that arrogance?
[00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.190]  No!
[00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:48.673]  They think, like Gruber said, we bet everything on the public having no memory.
[00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:57.318]  We bet everything on the public having absolutely
[00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.651]  Totally no memory.
[00:04:01.112 --> 00:04:24.949]  So we're going to be going over all of that because, I mean, here they are giving an award to three so-called reporters, Jake Tapper and others, at CNN, at the press dinner, in the middle of the scandal of Clapper perjuring himself to Congress, in front of the whole world.
[00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:27.951]  It'd be like if I said, I robbed a bank,
[00:04:29.423 --> 00:04:30.904]  On January 3rd.
[00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:35.807]  And then a couple months later, on April 3rd, I testified to Congress.
[00:04:35.827 --> 00:04:38.469]  I think the Clapper's case was actually April 10th.
[00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.650]  I never did.
[00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.852]  That's insane!
[00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:52.199]  Just like... We ought to queue it up where he said five years ago, I've never... No one in the NSA has ever spied on anybody in the U.S.
[00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:52.959]  Ever!
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.160]  Just doesn't happen.
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.662]  So we're going to come back from break with
[00:04:57.924 --> 00:04:58.145]  Ms.
[00:04:58.185 --> 00:05:01.720]  Wolf roasting herself, hoisted on her own petard.
[00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:08.699]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:10.200]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.600]  Go ahead.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.000]  Yes.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.161]  Hi, Alex.
[00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:18.465]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:22.647]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:05:22.887 --> 00:05:24.568]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:31.412]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:05:31.472 --> 00:05:34.394]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:05:34.574 --> 00:05:39.917]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:05:39.957 --> 00:05:47.782]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:05:47.802 --> 00:05:53.626]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:59.069]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.171]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[00:06:21.303 --> 00:06:27.790]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.292]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.174 --> 00:06:45.179]  Well, we rarely see mainstream media fall on its face in a more disgusting fashion.
[00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:48.382]  They do it all the time, but this was really special.
[00:06:48.402 --> 00:07:01.354]  We've got quite a few of the excerpts coming up this hour of Michelle Wolf of Viacom and Sumner Redstone, anti-American fame, same folks that brought you gangster rap and MTV.
[00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:24.394]  Well, they're not busy undermining the president, they're busy throwing fits that for the second year in a row he didn't show up to a correspondence dinner, when these are people sworn to destroy him, who absolutely hate him, who are talentless, that no one wants to watch, that has almost zero ratings, doesn't even show up, and if he shows up, then they get ratings.
[00:07:25.095 --> 00:07:29.159]  Why would you show up to have a bunch of feckless, craven,
[00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:33.032]  Unpopular losers.
[00:07:33.933 --> 00:07:36.334]  Cowardly individuals tell stupid jokes.
[00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:38.515]  The really sick one.
[00:07:39.816 --> 00:07:44.179]  A week and a half after a Southwest Airlines engine blew up.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.242]  Blew a hole in the side of the fuselage and sucked the woman halfway out.
[00:07:49.782 --> 00:07:51.824]  Almost cutting her head off before they drug her back in.
[00:07:51.864 --> 00:07:53.425]  She died hours later at the hospital.
[00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:54.685]  That's not funny.
[00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:58.988]  They say he's like a big orange Southwest engine.
[00:07:59.628 --> 00:08:00.289]  Blowing up.
[00:08:03.373 --> 00:08:13.838]  Hollywood, MTV, Comedy Central, all these shows, Stephen Colbert, they're in their own bizarre, hateful echo chambers.
[00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:20.722]  Can you imagine if I made a joke about an engine blowing up and killing a woman and injuring other people?
[00:08:23.424 --> 00:08:24.984]  And concerned it would say Hillary Clinton?
[00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:26.705]  You would never hear the end of it.
[00:08:26.745 --> 00:08:31.608]  Instead they make up things I never said or edit things I said to demonize me, but these people
[00:08:32.694 --> 00:08:33.475]  Are the hateful ones.
[00:08:35.136 --> 00:08:37.918]  And they're the ones that funded the Arab Spring that killed over a million people.
[00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:41.400]  Over 100,000 of them women and children.
[00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:43.862]  Many of which were sold into sex slavery.
[00:08:44.042 --> 00:08:46.824]  The ones that were unlucky enough to not be killed.
[00:08:47.265 --> 00:08:48.165]  And I mean that seriously.
[00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:53.669]  Sold into slavery that Islam still has operating in six countries.
[00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.473]  Six of the seven Trump banned from coming to the United States unvetted.
[00:08:58.673 --> 00:08:59.594]  We don't accept their
[00:09:01.496 --> 00:09:06.200]  Fake passports, and the Supreme Court set next week, the word is, to affirm the President.
[00:09:06.521 --> 00:09:07.561]  So we'll see how they like that.
[00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:08.322]  So that's coming up.
[00:09:09.323 --> 00:09:19.012]  Tying into the press dinner, they gave CNN an award for reporting on the Pissgate dossier, the Steele dossier, PPgate, which is admittedly totally fake.
[00:09:19.152 --> 00:09:19.832]  They admit it's fake.
[00:09:20.353 --> 00:09:27.900]  But they gave themselves an award thinking, you're so stupid, you won't remember that they now admit it's fake.
[00:09:29.144 --> 00:09:30.665]  Not just that Congress found there was no evidence.
[00:09:31.645 --> 00:09:36.047]  Even mainstream news has to admit there's no evidence any of the Steele dossier is real.
[00:09:36.267 --> 00:09:36.947]  But they don't care.
[00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:40.709]  They don't care they've lost all these lawsuits and the rest of it.
[00:09:40.749 --> 00:09:45.511]  They just keep rehashing and retreading the same thing over and over again.
[00:09:45.531 --> 00:09:54.034]  They had Comey on this week, on CNN, saying he doesn't know if the PPGate thing isn't true or not.
[00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:57.376]  He says he never saw it, there's no evidence of it, but who knows, it might be true.
[00:09:58.629 --> 00:10:01.670]  Might be true that monkeys, flying monkeys, fly out of his rear end as well.
[00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.071]  I'm not trying to get gross here.
[00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:06.632]  It's just this stuff is pure, absolute bull.
[00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:09.693]  We know Hillary was on the Chinese payroll, the Russian payroll.
[00:10:10.074 --> 00:10:11.414]  We know their servers went missing.
[00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:12.535]  It goes on and on.
[00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:24.379]  And so when people always bring up the FBI investigation and the Clinton Justice Department people and all of it, the big issue here is, where's the prosecution of them when it's open and shut?
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.580]  But enough of that.
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.121]  Let's go to some of the most unfunny
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.284]  Sickening, macabre, stumbling.
[00:10:32.905 --> 00:10:38.073]  This Comedy Central witch, who's getting her own show on Netflix.
[00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:44.221]  Yeah, and a half-eaten hamburger in a garbage pile can get a show on Netflix now.
[00:10:45.273 --> 00:10:55.405]  Netflix is giving this witch a show and I'm sure if it gets zero stars, like some of the other folks have gotten, I'm sure they'll just ban the rating system for that particular video.
[00:10:55.445 --> 00:11:02.633]  But here she is making sick jokes and so pissed that we're turning the country around from the brink of death.
[00:11:02.673 --> 00:11:02.954]  Here it is.
[00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:13.932]  You are hosting the White House Correspondents Dinner, which is a big event.
[00:11:13.972 --> 00:11:17.195]  For those who don't know, typically the president will be there.
[00:11:17.215 --> 00:11:19.978]  This president has decided to sit this last one out.
[00:11:19.998 --> 00:11:21.980]  Is he not coming to this event?
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.401]  No, he's not coming.
[00:11:23.921 --> 00:11:26.644]  I get the lovely Sarah Huckabee Sanders instead.
[00:11:29.847 --> 00:11:37.801]  There's this ironic thing on Vice TV and Comedy Central where they get women and men that kind of don't look right and who can't really talk.
[00:11:38.201 --> 00:11:42.969]  It's supposed to be real ironic, like we pay attention because we think they're kind of special.
[00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.731]  Let's go back to her.
[00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:54.475]  Michelle Wolf, now known as the 2018 Correspondent's Dinner Liberal Fail, with snappy one-liners that went absolutely nowhere.
[00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:57.016]  I'm gonna skip a lot of the normal pleasantries.
[00:11:57.056 --> 00:11:58.037]  We're at a Hilton.
[00:11:58.137 --> 00:11:59.037]  It's not nice.
[00:11:59.638 --> 00:12:00.918]  This is on C-SPAN.
[00:12:00.979 --> 00:12:02.279]  No one watches that.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.980]  Trump is president.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.361]  It's not ideal.
[00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:10.004]  White House Correspondent's Association, thank you for having me.
[00:12:10.044 --> 00:12:11.365]  The monkfish was fine.
[00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:19.817]  A shrill, ridiculing, shallow voice belting out insults catered to the nihilistic mind of the far left.
[00:12:19.857 --> 00:12:26.665]  See, I never really thought I'd be a comedian, but I did take an aptitude test in 7th grade and this is 100% true.
[00:12:27.165 --> 00:12:32.491]  I took an aptitude test in 7th grade and it said my best profession was a clown or a mime.
[00:12:34.193 --> 00:12:37.195]  First it said clown and then it heard my voice and was like, or maybe mime.
[00:12:37.756 --> 00:12:45.361]  It is kind of crazy that the Trump campaign was in contact with Russia when the Hillary campaign wasn't even in contact with Michigan.
[00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:49.064]  It's a direct flight.
[00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:49.764]  It's so close.
[00:12:50.264 --> 00:12:51.705]  Trump is racist though.
[00:12:51.726 --> 00:12:55.388]  He loves white nationalists.
[00:12:55.888 --> 00:12:57.970]  Which is a weird term for a Nazi.
[00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:03.494]  Calling a Nazi a white nationalist is like calling a pedophile a kid friend.
[00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:07.562]  Or Harvey Weinstein, a ladies man.
[00:13:08.243 --> 00:13:11.807]  And I'm never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[00:13:12.007 --> 00:13:12.428]  You know?
[00:13:12.508 --> 00:13:13.909]  Is it Sarah Sanders?
[00:13:13.989 --> 00:13:15.872]  Is it Sarah Huckabee Sanders?
[00:13:15.972 --> 00:13:17.413]  Is it Cousin Huckabee?
[00:13:17.774 --> 00:13:19.676]  Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders?
[00:13:20.057 --> 00:13:24.342]  Like, what's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women?
[00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:27.725]  Well, Ant Coulter.
[00:13:29.506 --> 00:13:36.631]  I did have a lot of jokes, I had a lot of jokes about cabinet members, but I had to scrap all of those because everyone has been fired.
[00:13:37.952 --> 00:13:42.055]  You guys are going through cabinet members quicker than Starbucks throws out black people.
[00:13:42.075 --> 00:13:46.118]  No, don't worry, they're having an afternoon.
[00:13:46.138 --> 00:13:48.360]  That'll solve it.
[00:13:49.508 --> 00:13:51.149]  We just needed an afternoon.
[00:13:51.549 --> 00:13:55.091]  Wolf counts her influences as Seth Meyers and Trevor Noah.
[00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:57.432]  No wonder her performance was so lame.
[00:13:57.532 --> 00:14:03.935]  I am also honored to be performing for those of you here tonight, as well as the handful of people watching at home on C-SPAN.
[00:14:05.896 --> 00:14:08.517]  Relying on tasteless shock humor and vulgarity.
[00:14:08.537 --> 00:14:12.539]  Trump is so broke.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.541]  Southwest used him as one of their engines.
[00:14:16.909 --> 00:14:18.370]  I know, it's so soon!
[00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.073]  It's so soon for that joke!
[00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:22.234]  Why didn't she tell it?
[00:14:22.274 --> 00:14:28.659]  If this is what funny is to the mainstream media, can you blame most Americans for their overwhelming distrust?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.223]  Past correspondents' dinner performers actually brought jokes.
[00:14:33.484 --> 00:14:37.247]  I have an announcement for those of you watching tonight's event live on C-SPAN.
[00:14:38.568 --> 00:14:40.249]  For God's sake, it's Saturday night.
[00:14:43.678 --> 00:14:45.099]  It is good to be on C-SPAN.
[00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:50.322]  I'm glad I'm not on your rival network, No Input, HDMI 1.
[00:14:51.663 --> 00:14:58.186]  But Wolf is the poster child for all of the attempted comedy shoved down America's throats these days.
[00:14:58.526 --> 00:15:06.651]  Hate-fueled diatribes by hacks who aren't even worthy to carry Richard Pryor or George Carlin's water to the stage.
[00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:09.853]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:16.786]  By the way, I used to watch Stephen Colbert and The Daily Show back when he was just one of the fake reporters on there.
[00:15:16.806 --> 00:15:21.787]  And it was entertaining, because the stuff he was saying about Bush most of the time was true.
[00:15:21.867 --> 00:15:23.487]  Bush had a lot of big problems.
[00:15:25.607 --> 00:15:29.028]  But now, with Trump, it's made up, or it's the same old hate.
[00:15:29.108 --> 00:15:29.928]  It's not funny.
[00:15:30.368 --> 00:15:33.809]  And I try to find good comedy, and it's not funny.
[00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:36.589]  I mean, remember Richard Pryor?
[00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:38.870]  Remember George Carlin?
[00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.550]  Remember
[00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:49.268]  Any of those comics, Bill Hicks or Sam Kennison or Rodney Dangerville, they were funny.
[00:15:49.888 --> 00:15:56.791]  They were political sometimes too, but they're just not funny anymore because corporate hacks put on a teleprompter what they're supposed to read.
[00:15:57.091 --> 00:15:58.812]  They're henchmen, they're not even comedians.
[00:15:59.052 --> 00:15:59.732]  They're puppets.
[00:15:59.772 --> 00:16:00.292]  We'll be back.
[00:16:00.312 --> 00:16:00.772]  Stay with us.
[00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:05.454]  InfoWars Live is launching its newest product.
[00:16:05.474 --> 00:16:07.215]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:10.456]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[00:16:11.565 --> 00:16:22.615]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[00:16:23.055 --> 00:16:32.123]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[00:16:32.643 --> 00:16:38.206]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[00:16:38.426 --> 00:16:43.589]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:45.830]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.152]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[00:16:49.411 --> 00:16:52.234]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[00:16:52.434 --> 00:16:53.836]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:16:54.456 --> 00:16:57.019]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:16:57.779 --> 00:16:59.741]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[00:17:00.302 --> 00:17:01.102]  Get yours today.
[00:17:01.423 --> 00:17:02.604]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:17:02.724 --> 00:17:05.947]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:17:06.387 --> 00:17:07.629]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:08.369]  I'm good.
[00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:29.294]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:35.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.405]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:17:40.925 --> 00:17:43.246]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:17:43.586 --> 00:17:44.926]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:17:45.327 --> 00:17:54.930]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.191]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:17:57.731 --> 00:18:02.593]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:10.515]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[00:18:11.396 --> 00:18:15.437]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:18:15.957 --> 00:18:18.298]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:18:19.078 --> 00:18:22.199]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:35.847]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:18:36.547 --> 00:18:51.616]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[00:18:52.597 --> 00:18:56.326]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[00:18:56.887 --> 00:18:58.591]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:18:58.631 --> 00:19:00.876]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[00:19:06.138 --> 00:19:07.538]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:07.598 --> 00:19:09.039]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:09.099 --> 00:19:09.439]  Go ahead.
[00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:09.839]  Yes.
[00:19:10.279 --> 00:19:10.999]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:17.300]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:21.501]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:23.182]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:23.542 --> 00:19:30.243]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:19:30.323 --> 00:19:33.364]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:36.866]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[00:19:37.187 --> 00:19:38.768]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:38.808 --> 00:19:46.633]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:19:46.653 --> 00:19:52.477]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:52.617 --> 00:19:57.921]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:19:57.941 --> 00:20:01.003]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[00:20:06.426 --> 00:20:09.060]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:17.264 --> 00:20:18.385]  It's never gonna get any better.
[00:20:18.805 --> 00:20:19.505]  Don't look for it.
[00:20:19.946 --> 00:20:21.086]  Be happy with what you got.
[00:20:22.227 --> 00:20:25.289]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[00:20:25.829 --> 00:20:27.470]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:28.951]  The real owners.
[00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:33.534]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[00:20:33.914 --> 00:20:35.135]  Forget the politicians.
[00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:38.637]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[00:20:40.218 --> 00:20:40.598]  You don't.
[00:20:41.428 --> 00:20:42.409]  You have no choice.
[00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:43.710]  You have owners.
[00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.071]  They own you.
[00:20:46.292 --> 00:20:47.573]  They own everything.
[00:20:47.593 --> 00:20:49.494]  They own all the important land.
[00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:51.576]  They own and control the corporations.
[00:20:51.596 --> 00:20:55.079]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[00:20:55.099 --> 00:20:56.660]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.824]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[00:21:02.004 --> 00:21:03.645]  They got you by the balls!
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.201]  They want obedient workers.
[00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:09.161]  Obedient workers.
[00:21:09.481 --> 00:21:22.205]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[00:21:22.245 --> 00:21:28.626]  And now, they're coming for your social security money, so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[00:21:30.027 --> 00:21:30.967]  It's a big club.
[00:21:31.934 --> 00:21:32.975]  And you ain't in it.
[00:21:32.995 --> 00:21:38.277]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[00:21:38.638 --> 00:21:39.518]  You better believe it.
[00:21:39.618 --> 00:21:41.499]  So what specifically did they do?
[00:21:41.939 --> 00:21:47.102]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage, I've given to, just so you understand.
[00:21:47.322 --> 00:21:47.943]  A lot of money.
[00:21:48.563 --> 00:21:51.264]  You and I are not in the big club.
[00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:53.546]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[00:21:54.206 --> 00:21:57.908]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[00:21:59.329 --> 00:22:00.790]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.673]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[00:22:04.693 --> 00:22:08.616]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[00:22:08.656 --> 00:22:09.597]  They're not interested in that.
[00:22:09.877 --> 00:22:10.818]  That doesn't help them.
[00:22:11.198 --> 00:22:12.579]  That's against their interest.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.500]  That's right.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.844]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:22:22.847 --> 00:22:28.051]  If you just joined us, I played that George Carlin intro we've had for like three years, two and a half years.
[00:22:29.397 --> 00:22:41.344]  From back during the middle of the first debates, back when there was like 11 Republican candidates with Trump, because that's a real comedian that can bring in social issues from a populist perspective, not left or right.
[00:22:42.225 --> 00:22:49.329]  We interviewed George Carlin, one of my reporters, right before he died, and he was really on target and had a lot of courage.
[00:22:51.891 --> 00:22:57.294]  That goes without saying, but you juxtapose that with Michelle Wolf of Commie Central,
[00:22:58.749 --> 00:23:06.232]  Making jokes about the woman that died getting sucked out the window a week and a half ago saying I was a big orange engine like Trump killed her.
[00:23:06.252 --> 00:23:07.912]  It's not about Trump.
[00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:10.593]  You don't make fun of a woman that just died.
[00:23:11.013 --> 00:23:12.194]  It's super untasteful.
[00:23:12.214 --> 00:23:15.575]  I'm going to get to that in a minute and then to the big news.
[00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:20.516]  But Trump comes from the outside of the billionaire circles.
[00:23:21.197 --> 00:23:25.158]  He made his money in operations not with the globalist combines.
[00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:46.181]  At the highest levels, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, Apple, IBM, General Electric, and the list goes on, the top Fortune 30 or so of the Fortune 100 are 100% technocrats in their own words.
[00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:46.641]  Look it up!
[00:23:47.061 --> 00:23:52.484]  Dabos leaders call themselves technocrats, call for the end of elections, call for appointing leaders of governments.
[00:23:53.544 --> 00:23:55.045]  Jeff Bezos though, how did he make his money?
[00:23:55.245 --> 00:23:59.988]  He made $12 billion in one day last week.
[00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:01.089]  He's worth $140 billion now.
[00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.891]  Now there's Bloomberg.
[00:24:03.251 --> 00:24:06.633]  Jeff Bezos boosts fortune by $12 billion in a day.
[00:24:08.835 --> 00:24:10.496]  Now, I'm all for free market.
[00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.237]  He didn't make his money that way.
[00:24:12.577 --> 00:24:13.518]  He's a monopoly man.
[00:24:13.538 --> 00:24:15.379]  He needs to be broken up.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.741]  And he will be broken up.
[00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:25.095]  Once a monopoly starts surging like a cancer like this, because of inside deals with government, it'll displace everything.
[00:24:25.315 --> 00:24:31.779]  That's why he's buying up, I was reading, he's buying over a hundred stories of high-rises a day.
[00:24:32.379 --> 00:24:33.480]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.083]  He's building and buying 100 stories a day just in high-rises.
[00:24:39.143 --> 00:24:41.785]  That's in another Bloomberg article I saw last week.
[00:24:42.285 --> 00:24:43.906]  A hundred stories a day.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.524]  And he is the number one funder after George Soros of the Democratic Party.
[00:24:54.005 --> 00:24:59.330]  We know for a fact, and we've got the intel coming out very soon, that he's financing lawsuits against us and Trump.
[00:25:00.712 --> 00:25:01.873]  Right along with Soros and others.
[00:25:01.893 --> 00:25:03.314]  He's tried to hide this until now.
[00:25:03.594 --> 00:25:06.297]  He owns the Washington Post, a weapon against this country.
[00:25:07.318 --> 00:25:11.542]  He gets $1.50, it was $1.48, on every package USPS ships for him.
[00:25:11.562 --> 00:25:13.144]  That's over 70% of his packages.
[00:25:15.131 --> 00:25:17.532]  Ladies and gentlemen, the man is a cancer.
[00:25:17.652 --> 00:25:20.073]  And I went down to Whole Foods today, the headquarters.
[00:25:20.114 --> 00:25:21.474]  He's bought Whole Foods, Amazon.
[00:25:21.494 --> 00:25:22.455]  It's now Amazon Foods.
[00:25:22.675 --> 00:25:23.615]  They admit they're not organic.
[00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:24.796]  Most of their stuff now is terrible.
[00:25:25.836 --> 00:25:27.097]  Very polite, got thrown out.
[00:25:27.117 --> 00:25:28.138]  Security guard was very nice.
[00:25:28.838 --> 00:25:29.698]  Most people were fans there.
[00:25:29.718 --> 00:25:33.580]  I thought more would be, you know, deranged liberals, but they were mainline liberals, smart liberals.
[00:25:34.521 --> 00:25:37.462]  And nice security guard says, hey, we're asking you to leave.
[00:25:37.482 --> 00:25:38.503]  I said, absolutely, I leave.
[00:25:38.523 --> 00:25:40.444]  We're on the very end of the corner.
[00:25:41.314 --> 00:25:42.195]  No one's even around.
[00:25:42.715 --> 00:25:44.736]  Other guys come over and threaten us if we don't leave.
[00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:45.957]  I said, I am leaving, but I can get my car.
[00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:46.498]  Can I get my car?
[00:25:46.718 --> 00:25:47.198]  Wouldn't say.
[00:25:47.639 --> 00:25:48.599]  So I got back in their face.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.621]  We're going to go back with HD cameras this week.
[00:25:52.262 --> 00:25:55.144]  We're going to go back with HD cameras and I'm going to bullhorn the whole place.
[00:25:56.245 --> 00:26:02.289]  Jeff Bezos, Amazon, Unorganic Food Headquarters.
[00:26:02.309 --> 00:26:03.190]  So that's all coming up.
[00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:07.313]  And I just thought of doing it this morning because I've been thinking about it for a long time.
[00:26:09.551 --> 00:26:10.291]  I love my wife.
[00:26:10.311 --> 00:26:15.092]  I don't tell her what to do on a lot of things, but I said, listen, I don't want to see Amazon packages here anymore.
[00:26:15.732 --> 00:26:17.032]  We're not going to Whole Foods anymore.
[00:26:17.052 --> 00:26:18.653]  They're overpriced anyways.
[00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:26.514]  Buy the exact same stuff for less at other places that are too expensive, like the HEB, you know, version of Whole Foods Central Market.
[00:26:27.194 --> 00:26:28.334]  I said, we're not doing it.
[00:26:30.094 --> 00:26:31.475]  And she never goes there anymore.
[00:26:31.515 --> 00:26:31.995]  That's good.
[00:26:32.075 --> 00:26:36.055]  But I still like dog droppings or something at my house, man.
[00:26:36.476 --> 00:26:38.696]  I get home and there's an Amazon box like a devil.
[00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:42.971]  Sitting there in my house, and I know she's gotten better about ordering different places.
[00:26:43.372 --> 00:26:46.154]  She goes, oh, it's so quick, it's less money, because it's all subsidized.
[00:26:47.555 --> 00:26:49.236]  And the last straw was, I love her to death.
[00:26:49.256 --> 00:26:49.717]  She's great.
[00:26:49.857 --> 00:26:52.439]  She only orders from every few weeks, you know, not every day, something coming in.
[00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:54.280]  She's ordered food from there, everything.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.542]  She would order things and go, yeah, the shampoo's old, doesn't work right.
[00:26:56.602 --> 00:26:58.183]  I said, yeah, they buy rejected crap.
[00:26:58.503 --> 00:26:59.524]  Amazon's bad news.
[00:27:00.945 --> 00:27:01.626]  And I'm sitting there.
[00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:12.241]  And I'm just thinking about all the things Amazon's done and the thousands of companies it owns, hundreds of big ones, they own like 20 of the Fortune 100.
[00:27:12.321 --> 00:27:20.445]  And I showed her this morning, I said, look, and I typed in Alex Jones, Washington Post, snake oil.
[00:27:22.065 --> 00:27:26.807]  And she was looking at like six articles saying I'm a snake oil salesman, I'm a fraud by the Washington Post.
[00:27:27.067 --> 00:27:29.108]  And I said, sweetheart, he owns the Washington Post.
[00:27:30.185 --> 00:27:31.826]  He's the biggest supplement owner in the country.
[00:27:32.646 --> 00:27:38.828]  I went and got more than a dozen products off our shelf that are private-labeled, high-quality, that they also private-label at Whole Foods.
[00:27:39.829 --> 00:27:42.049]  And I said, sweetheart, they sell this for $30 at Whole Foods.
[00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:44.851]  It's the same bottle, same thing, different label we sell for $19.95.
[00:27:45.411 --> 00:27:50.953]  I said, you understand, he is a guy that made $12 billion in one day last week, another $5 billion the other days.
[00:27:52.099 --> 00:27:53.480]  He's trying to put us out of business.
[00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:59.605]  He's hired a bunch of former CIA people, this is in the news, to run the Washington Post to try to destroy the country.
[00:28:00.025 --> 00:28:02.447]  They're quarterbacking operations against our family.
[00:28:03.988 --> 00:28:06.090]  And they're quarterbacking it against the entire country.
[00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.133]  And I said, I don't want to see another Amazon package here ever again.
[00:28:10.393 --> 00:28:11.474]  She goes, no, I get it.
[00:28:11.674 --> 00:28:12.014]  I understand.
[00:28:12.034 --> 00:28:12.855]  I didn't know it was that bad.
[00:28:12.875 --> 00:28:14.096]  I thought you just didn't like him.
[00:28:14.336 --> 00:28:14.876]  I said, no.
[00:28:16.838 --> 00:28:17.979]  The man is a psychotic.
[00:28:19.775 --> 00:28:21.877]  He is out to get the president and the country.
[00:28:21.917 --> 00:28:22.738]  He wants you poor.
[00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:26.322]  He is so competitive, reportedly, he will throw incredible fits over a penny.
[00:28:28.304 --> 00:28:33.891]  He bought the Washington Post and cut their pay and cut everything, and the liberals still worship it like women under a pimp.
[00:28:34.732 --> 00:28:36.754]  He owns the biggest sweatshops in the U.S.
[00:28:37.034 --> 00:28:41.179]  He's buying all these big buildings and building them with 250 square foot apartments in them.
[00:28:43.737 --> 00:28:54.490]  And then people pay even more than they'd pay for a thousand square foot and live in them, and he's getting it zoned where they can't build new apartments that are bigger to make you live like a slave under him when he lives in a 50,000 square foot house.
[00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.112]  He's a monster!
[00:28:56.432 --> 00:28:57.513]  He's a scumbag!
[00:28:57.774 --> 00:29:00.116]  He's an anti-American globalist enemy!
[00:29:02.313 --> 00:29:06.778]  Alpha Power, vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[00:29:06.898 --> 00:29:14.766]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:16.888]  But, here's what you want to know.
[00:29:17.858 --> 00:29:23.800]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.022]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[00:29:28.882 --> 00:29:36.885]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:45.148]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[00:29:45.948 --> 00:29:49.713]  It's got the best of ancient science, with the latest developments as well.
[00:29:50.274 --> 00:29:54.260]  It's Alpha Power, and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[00:29:55.314 --> 00:30:15.913]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes, and so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:17.815]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you,
[00:30:18.115 --> 00:30:19.436]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[00:30:19.456 --> 00:30:21.658]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with all the power.
[00:30:21.838 --> 00:30:24.060]  Because I said, I want to dominate the industry.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.924]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[00:30:28.944 --> 00:30:30.265]  I'm going to explain this, because this is critical.
[00:30:31.106 --> 00:30:37.311]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[00:30:37.711 --> 00:30:39.773]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[00:30:40.353 --> 00:30:41.934]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[00:30:41.954 --> 00:30:43.075]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[00:30:43.135 --> 00:30:44.797]  You've got marketing other costs that go in.
[00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:48.520]  But here's an example.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:56.946]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[00:30:56.966 --> 00:30:58.687]  It just has a little bit in it.
[00:30:59.148 --> 00:31:05.313]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[00:31:05.993 --> 00:31:11.100]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:19.731]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[00:31:20.131 --> 00:31:21.153]  Nobody else does that.
[00:31:21.233 --> 00:31:23.896]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[00:31:24.417 --> 00:31:40.559]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[00:31:40.959 --> 00:31:49.924]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[00:31:50.284 --> 00:31:52.305]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[00:31:52.685 --> 00:31:58.288]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsTore.com by calling toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[00:31:58.328 --> 00:31:59.008]  A total 360 win.
[00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:11.622]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:18.731]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:32:20.493 --> 00:32:26.836]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:32:27.656 --> 00:32:32.899]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:32:33.499 --> 00:32:41.783]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms in
[00:32:41.883 --> 00:32:44.064]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:40.094 --> 00:33:50.497]  Now, if you want to see arrogance, if you want to see hypocrisy, few examples are better than, again, the White House Correspondents' Dinner 2018.
[00:33:51.358 --> 00:34:05.682]  Trump has been roundly criticized by dinosaur and kleptocrat, decepticon, slimeball, prostitute, disinformation, coastal elites, media.
[00:34:06.817 --> 00:34:28.522]  For not going to the Correspondence Center, which was good-natured until just a few years ago, and vicious and deceptive, the very same group of Jim Acosta types that say that Trump didn't really visit Congressman Scalise in the hospital, even though there was live video of it, or that they'd removed Martin Luther King's bust from the Oval Office.
[00:34:29.462 --> 00:34:30.342]  All of it lies.
[00:34:31.923 --> 00:34:36.046]  But, Jake Tapper and all the rest of them, hoping that you don't pay attention.
[00:34:36.086 --> 00:34:46.654]  So, if it couldn't get any more sickening, Jake Tapper got caught hosting fake town halls in the aftermath of the shootings in Florida back in February.
[00:34:47.555 --> 00:34:48.836]  I never said the shootings didn't happen.
[00:34:48.856 --> 00:34:50.097]  I said they had fake town halls.
[00:34:50.737 --> 00:34:58.363]  I said that they got four scripted students who had talking points for the Democrats to be the voice of the anti-gun movement, instead of the pro-gun students.
[00:34:59.875 --> 00:35:00.396]  Which is all true!
[00:35:01.136 --> 00:35:08.003]  So you just build a straw man, and demonize good old Alex Jones, and then you can set the pressure to demonize the next patriot.
[00:35:08.484 --> 00:35:21.757]  Just like they've said Trump's a loser, Trump's a liar, Trump's going to prison, Trump's a criminal, everybody hates Trump, Trump doesn't have ratings, Trump's gonna lose the election, Trump's a racist, Trump's a Nazi, Trump's a misogynist, Trump's a racist, Trump's a rapist.
[00:35:21.937 --> 00:35:22.498]  None of it true!
[00:35:24.124 --> 00:35:35.452]  They do the same thing with Infowars because they know we're looking out for the average person and for free market, for a level playing field, for a true open society that Jeff Bezos and all the rest of them don't like.
[00:35:36.893 --> 00:35:45.359]  So, they have the Merriman Smith Award for Excellence in Journalism on Presidential Reporting.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.141]  Whatever that means.
[00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:49.942]  And just like
[00:35:52.304 --> 00:35:58.908]  They gave Obama, when he was president-elect, a Nobel Peace Prize, and he launched more wars than the last three presidents combined.
[00:36:01.729 --> 00:36:02.349]  Think about that.
[00:36:04.611 --> 00:36:06.312]  Let's put the award back on screen for TV viewers.
[00:36:06.332 --> 00:36:08.173]  Here, I'll read it to viewers and listeners.
[00:36:10.074 --> 00:36:11.354]  Because I want to go over this for people.
[00:36:11.675 --> 00:36:13.235]  You guys put the Merriman-Smith Award.
[00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:14.076]  It's a $2,500 award.
[00:36:16.556 --> 00:36:18.077]  Not the half million, I guess the Nobel is.
[00:36:18.137 --> 00:36:18.677]  What's the Nobel now?
[00:36:18.697 --> 00:36:19.357]  Let's look that up.
[00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:35.123]  The Merriman Smith Memorial Award for Excellence in Presidential News Coverage Under Deadline Pressure originated in 1970 in memory of Merriman Smith of United Press International, a White House correspondent of more than 30 years.
[00:36:35.143 --> 00:36:42.867]  The $2,500 award was conceived to perpetuate Mr. Smith's memory and to promote the excellence he brought to his profession.
[00:36:42.887 --> 00:36:43.647]  The award
[00:36:45.325 --> 00:36:46.706]  Is offered in two categories.
[00:36:47.047 --> 00:36:50.990]  Print, newspaper, wire service magazine, broadcast, radio, and television.
[00:36:51.451 --> 00:36:53.192]  So, drumroll please!
[00:36:54.834 --> 00:37:00.039]  Did they give the award to Jake Tapper and two other CNN reporters for reporting on a plane crashing?
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.281]  Or the fires in California?
[00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:04.343]  Or something where they could actually tell the truth?
[00:37:05.504 --> 00:37:06.405]  And maybe do a good job?
[00:37:07.145 --> 00:37:07.966]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:37:08.487 --> 00:37:10.408]  They didn't give them an award for fake town halls.
[00:37:11.505 --> 00:37:14.888]  In Parkland, where only anti-gunners were allowed in and given prescriptive questions.
[00:37:15.609 --> 00:37:19.972]  They didn't give them an award for a few years ago, CNN scripting questions for the debate, not telling Trump.
[00:37:22.834 --> 00:37:23.035]  No.
[00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:28.199]  They gave them an award for being the go-to leakers, as the Daily Caller has said.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:39.648]  They gave them an award, drumroll please, for their coverage of the Steele Fusion GPS
[00:37:40.697 --> 00:37:49.002]  PP dossier that is admitted to be a total fraud paid for by the FBI directly to their wives and husbands at the firm as a payoff.
[00:37:49.723 --> 00:37:53.425]  And then I love how Comey's been on the news this week saying the Republicans paid for it.
[00:37:53.606 --> 00:37:59.770]  Well, there was some early Jeb Bush stuff with another company that he didn't like Trump, so he passed it on to them.
[00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.051]  But that was mafia stuff.
[00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:04.152]  That was not this.
[00:38:06.314 --> 00:38:06.994]  Opposition research.
[00:38:07.014 --> 00:38:07.715]  And that was fake too.
[00:38:10.023 --> 00:38:21.677]  So, this is so amazing that they're so delusional, they're so disconnected, they would give Obama a Peace Prize when he had never even been in office at an executive branch involved in the military.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.840]  He'd never been in the Coast Guard.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.381]  He'd never been in the Boy Scouts.
[00:38:26.921 --> 00:38:28.962]  He'd never been in the Army Reserves.
[00:38:29.002 --> 00:38:31.663]  He'd never put a rifle over his shoulder.
[00:38:32.263 --> 00:38:34.403]  He'd never been in the Peace Corps.
[00:38:34.844 --> 00:38:36.324]  He'd never done a diplomatic errand.
[00:38:36.364 --> 00:38:38.685]  He'd done nothing but he got the award.
[00:38:39.105 --> 00:38:41.066]  Now does Trump get a Nobel Peace Prize?
[00:38:41.206 --> 00:38:41.766]  I nominate
[00:38:42.406 --> 00:38:52.674]  President Trump, for the Nobel Peace Prize already, for just getting North and South Korea to meet after almost 60 years, since 1953 when the armistice happened, there's been a continued war.
[00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:58.679]  They just met last week, shook hands and agreed to a peace treaty to end the war after 60 plus years.
[00:39:01.441 --> 00:39:03.242]  Nobel Prize is now 1.4 million.
[00:39:03.262 --> 00:39:03.803]  Wow, it's up.
[00:39:07.425 --> 00:39:10.488]  I guess it's 2.6 in Dutch money.
[00:39:12.253 --> 00:39:14.575]  Nobel who invented dynamite and felt guilty about it.
[00:39:14.775 --> 00:39:15.536]  Nitroglycerin.
[00:39:15.756 --> 00:39:24.184]  So, I am nominating President Trump for the Peace Prize for trying to get us out of Syria, for beginning to end the Korean War.
[00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:33.592]  And if he does get this peace deal, and they do denuclearize, and they do agree to merge North and South to a future deal, he absolutely must have it.
[00:39:33.632 --> 00:39:36.074]  But don't hold your breath because it's a fake award.
[00:39:36.614 --> 00:39:39.237]  The award would mean something if it was given to real people.
[00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:50.542]  Markel Thelen broke five years ago for Infowars the entire Stingray document plan nationwide to our risk as an operation.
[00:39:50.582 --> 00:39:51.423]  We got threatened for that.
[00:39:51.903 --> 00:39:52.703]  Zero coverage.
[00:39:53.323 --> 00:39:55.483]  The AP reported on it a month ago with the same documents.
[00:39:56.304 --> 00:39:58.104]  Where's Markel Thelen's Pulitzer Prize?
[00:39:58.344 --> 00:40:00.604]  But the Pulitzer Prize is there for being a lapdog.
[00:40:00.784 --> 00:40:01.845]  We don't want your prizes.
[00:40:02.085 --> 00:40:07.806]  Our prizes are the people supporting us, getting the word out, having success, and living in a freer, better country and world.
[00:40:08.126 --> 00:40:08.906]  That's our prize.
[00:40:14.932 --> 00:40:27.786]  Now let's go ahead and go to the amazing video of CNN being given an award for reporting on a known fraud which Clapper has now been caught lying about yet again.
[00:40:27.846 --> 00:40:28.167]  Here it is.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.744]  The Merriman-Smith Award honors presidential news coverage under deadline pressure.
[00:40:34.504 --> 00:40:43.091]  The award is in memory of the late, great Merriman-Smith of United Press International, a White House correspondent for more than 30 years.
[00:40:43.111 --> 00:40:46.633]  It is given in two categories, broadcast and print.
[00:40:47.854 --> 00:40:57.621]  The Merriman-Smith Award for broadcast goes to Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, Jake Tapper, and Carl Bernstein of CNN.
[00:41:03.115 --> 00:41:08.657]  I nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize from the great Swedish inventor of dynamite.
[00:41:10.297 --> 00:41:10.798]  Nobel.
[00:41:11.798 --> 00:41:17.680]  He's the one getting peace in the peninsula.
[00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:31.172]  Well stop right there for a minute.
[00:41:31.372 --> 00:41:46.080]  So that they skip over the fact that it's admitted to be fake now and give them an award for their reporting on how they were briefed that we've got this ridiculous footage of hookers marking their territory.
[00:41:47.318 --> 00:41:56.063]  So again, I nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for the inventor of dynamite, nitroglycerin, Mr. Nobel of Sweden.
[00:41:57.063 --> 00:42:04.827]  And I nominate that he go ahead and get it now, because he did way more getting North and South to end the war, and agree to signing an armistice, and agree to denuclearize.
[00:42:05.208 --> 00:42:09.830]  Even if it doesn't all happen, he's gotten more done light years than Obama ever did.
[00:42:10.851 --> 00:42:14.953]  So, let's go out to break with the rest of this sickening display, these people getting an award.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.581]  You may remember that story.
[00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:18.041]  This is make-believe.
[00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:19.923]  The CNN team later reported... Hey, pause again.
[00:42:20.243 --> 00:42:22.064]  You may remember that story.
[00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:23.064]  It's all a big joke, see?
[00:42:23.304 --> 00:42:24.345]  We remember it's fake.
[00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:25.446]  The public doesn't.
[00:42:25.686 --> 00:42:27.847]  So we're gonna bring it back up and hope they don't remember again.
[00:42:27.927 --> 00:42:28.267]  Here it is.
[00:42:28.287 --> 00:42:33.150]  FBI Director James Comey personally briefed Trump about the dossier.
[00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:38.633]  The judges called their reporting breaking news at its very best.
[00:42:38.933 --> 00:42:39.434]  Okay, yeah.
[00:42:39.654 --> 00:42:40.534]  Fake news at its best.
[00:42:40.554 --> 00:42:40.855]  There you go.
[00:42:40.875 --> 00:42:41.395]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:42:42.401 --> 00:42:43.662]  There's Jake Tapper up there, all of them.
[00:42:43.682 --> 00:42:45.242]  This is a true comedy.
[00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:46.223]  They're all up there laughing.
[00:42:48.183 --> 00:42:53.266]  Oh my gosh, why not give them awards for walking on the moon or, you know, beating Hitler or whatever.
[00:42:53.286 --> 00:42:56.687]  It was George Soros, by the way, that physically cut Hitler's head off, by the way.
[00:42:57.067 --> 00:42:58.308]  Yeah, he was Captain America.
[00:42:58.328 --> 00:42:59.028]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:59.248 --> 00:43:00.169]  Give me my award for that.
[00:43:00.229 --> 00:43:00.869]  Report it, please.
[00:43:02.668 --> 00:43:03.269]  Alpha Power.
[00:43:03.629 --> 00:43:04.450]  Here's what you want to know.
[00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:10.636]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[00:43:11.297 --> 00:43:14.820]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[00:43:15.714 --> 00:43:23.659]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:31.384]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[00:43:31.825 --> 00:43:33.506]  It just has a little bit in it.
[00:43:33.886 --> 00:43:38.989]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:42.652]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in.
[00:43:43.132 --> 00:43:47.573]  And you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[00:43:47.993 --> 00:43:49.014]  Nobody else does that.
[00:43:49.094 --> 00:43:51.874]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[00:43:52.154 --> 00:43:54.175]  Again, Alpha Bauer sold out for months.
[00:43:54.555 --> 00:44:00.036]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll-free, AAA, 253-3139.
[00:44:03.277 --> 00:44:04.018]  I'm so excited.
[00:44:04.078 --> 00:44:13.644]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:44:14.224 --> 00:44:22.530]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:31.496]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:44:33.617 --> 00:44:52.705]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:44:53.206 --> 00:44:54.506]  It is amazing!
[00:44:55.907 --> 00:45:00.869]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:45:02.785 --> 00:45:04.627]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:45:04.667 --> 00:45:05.027]  Go ahead.
[00:45:05.908 --> 00:45:07.810]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:18.181]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:21.705]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:45:22.165 --> 00:45:22.505]  Absolutely.
[00:45:44.874 --> 00:45:57.789]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:46:03.337 --> 00:46:07.399]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:46:58.717 --> 00:47:01.059]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:05.781 --> 00:47:08.423]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.001 --> 00:47:31.303]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:43.907 --> 00:47:44.867]  We are back live.
[00:47:46.314 --> 00:47:52.280]  Coming up next hour, Jake Lloyd, one of our great InfoWars reporters, also an Army combat vet patriot.
[00:47:53.041 --> 00:48:00.849]  He went out on the road with me today to Whole Foods, now owned by Jeff Bezos, the head of Amazon.
[00:48:03.334 --> 00:48:06.436]  He's now basically degrading the quality of the food there, that's in the news.
[00:48:06.877 --> 00:48:09.719]  Most of it's not organic now, he's doing all the regular stuff he does.
[00:48:10.159 --> 00:48:22.027]  But the issue is, he made $12 billion in one day last week, due to government contracts, kickbacks, CIA contracts, $1.50 on every package he ships, USPS.
[00:48:23.048 --> 00:48:24.209]  Other people don't get that.
[00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:26.691]  Now there's Bloomberg, $12 billion.
[00:48:28.352 --> 00:48:30.413]  He made, just last week, he's an anti-gunner.
[00:48:31.363 --> 00:48:32.704]  He's an anti-free marketer.
[00:48:32.784 --> 00:48:35.244]  He said, Trump is killing our democracy.
[00:48:35.284 --> 00:48:36.465]  I thought Trump got elected.
[00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:38.466]  So he's a globalist.
[00:48:38.526 --> 00:48:39.386]  So that's all coming up.
[00:48:39.766 --> 00:48:44.528]  But first, we'll have some of the footage for TV and radio listeners that we're going to air here.
[00:48:44.548 --> 00:48:47.129]  When I went in there today, the full footage is up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:48.849 --> 00:48:50.030]  Here's a Jack Posobiec tweet.
[00:48:52.298 --> 00:48:52.959]  From Friday.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:05.792]  While they were calling him a warmonger, a homophobe, and a racist, Donald Trump ended the Korean War, appointed the first gay ambassador to Germany, and got endorsed by Kanye all in the same week.
[00:49:06.893 --> 00:49:08.555]  And it's not about just cheerleading Trump.
[00:49:09.516 --> 00:49:13.881]  But Trump is pragmatically trying to create a level playing field and bring jobs into this country.
[00:49:15.583 --> 00:49:23.549]  And so, I didn't even know until I said it and they pulled it up, I didn't even know the New York Post has reported the lobbying for Trump's Nobel Peace Prize has already begun.
[00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:36.639]  Well, I think the Nobel Peace Prize is worthless because they've given Henry Kissinger and Al Gore and Barack Obama peace prizes.
[00:49:36.859 --> 00:49:37.539]  They're jokes.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:44.845]  Yeah, back when they gave Alexander Shultz and Eatson one or Martin Luther King one or Gandhi one, they had some meaning.
[00:49:46.394 --> 00:49:50.977]  I would not accept a Nobel Prize, or I'd take the money and give it to charity, because it's a million and a half dollars.
[00:49:51.417 --> 00:49:51.778]  Seriously.
[00:49:52.278 --> 00:49:56.300]  The thing is a joke, but the nomination process has begun.
[00:49:56.361 --> 00:49:59.302]  It's very, very serious, because North and South have declared the end of the war.
[00:49:59.342 --> 00:50:01.444]  They're going to sign a deal ahead of the meeting with Trump.
[00:50:02.725 --> 00:50:12.451]  The war's been going on since the armistice was signed in, it's been going on since late 49, but it's been ongoing since the ceasefire, since the armistice in February of 1953.
[00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:21.351]  So we'll see what happens there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:21.371 --> 00:50:25.432]  It just shows how dramatic Trump has been delivering on so many fronts.
[00:50:25.493 --> 00:50:27.253]  Now, let's move on to the big news.
[00:50:33.535 --> 00:50:36.095]  By the way, I'm pretty original, but when I rip off Rush Limbaugh, I do it.
[00:50:41.617 --> 00:50:42.637]  I like doing that occasionally.
[00:50:43.277 --> 00:50:44.437]  I'm like a Pavlovian dog.
[00:50:44.457 --> 00:50:47.078]  When I see Rush Limbaugh do that, like in high school and college, I get really excited.
[00:50:51.377 --> 00:50:52.077]  I think I do it better though.
[00:50:52.097 --> 00:50:54.778]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:55.679]  Let's get serious.
[00:50:56.639 --> 00:51:13.085]  Look, Clapper doesn't matter, Brennan doesn't matter, Hillary doesn't matter, except they're still the deep state dug in with their operatives in government, dug in like ticks, doing whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want, leaking criminally, lying to Congress, getting caught.
[00:51:14.906 --> 00:51:17.787]  Finally though, it's even in mainstream news.
[00:51:17.847 --> 00:51:19.227]  Even The Hill had a report on it.
[00:51:19.247 --> 00:51:20.508]  Zero Hedge has the best article.
[00:51:22.619 --> 00:51:23.939]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:30.221]  Clapper busted leaking dossier details of CNN's Jake Tapper lying to Congress about it.
[00:51:30.241 --> 00:51:35.622]  Now remember, the statute of limitations just ended a few months ago, five years after he testified to Congress.
[00:51:35.702 --> 00:51:37.103]  And did I forget to tell you guys to pull that up too?
[00:51:37.383 --> 00:51:37.923]  Pull that up next.
[00:51:38.783 --> 00:51:40.764]  He's typing, Clapper lies to Congress, he's famous.
[00:51:41.244 --> 00:51:44.625]  And he says, no, the NSA does not listen to anything in the U.S.
[00:51:45.285 --> 00:51:45.865]  or read anything.
[00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:47.750]  No, just everything.
[00:51:48.291 --> 00:51:54.673]  By the time he said that, everything, except CB radio transmissions, goes through an NSA hub, and most of those do.
[00:51:56.494 --> 00:52:00.975]  You don't think the NSA doesn't know someone on a CB or another radio or ham radio is really trying not to be heard?
[00:52:01.195 --> 00:52:02.236]  They're really listening to that.
[00:52:03.036 --> 00:52:04.637]  So, but they don't catch it all.
[00:52:05.637 --> 00:52:06.898]  And it's totally unconstitutional.
[00:52:07.678 --> 00:52:10.879]  Clapper busted leaking dossier details of CNN's Jake Tapper.
[00:52:11.339 --> 00:52:14.080]  Tapper just got an award for the fake reporting earlier, showed you that.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.661]  Lying to Congress about it.
[00:52:16.547 --> 00:52:22.829]  We look forward to Clapper talking his way out of this one on CNN during carefully scripted conversations with fellow talking heads.
[00:52:23.169 --> 00:52:24.110]  That was on Friday.
[00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:31.012]  And then it just goes through all the times he testified to Congress, all the news articles, all the under oath.
[00:52:31.413 --> 00:52:33.513]  It's a long article, where he said it, where he did it.
[00:52:33.533 --> 00:52:34.834]  There's videos of it, everything.
[00:52:35.254 --> 00:52:38.775]  I mean, we should make a special report out of this just to show it all.
[00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:39.696]  It is incredible.
[00:52:40.576 --> 00:52:42.797]  But he said, I did not link the dossier.
[00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.391]  Now that's being pointed out it's fake and it's illegal.
[00:52:47.451 --> 00:52:51.652]  He went on radio and TV to say he leaked it before.
[00:52:52.372 --> 00:53:04.896]  So even Don Lemon is throwing Clapper overboard, which is a sign that when Don Lemon is throwing your butt overboard, when Don Lemon is looking at you like you're a liar,
[00:53:06.263 --> 00:53:09.004]  He thinks you're in big trouble and he better not side with you.
[00:53:09.344 --> 00:53:11.805]  Because he's about as bad as it gets when it comes to fake news.
[00:53:12.265 --> 00:53:16.826]  Some of the worst people, you know, just like Tapper at CNN getting awards for fake journalism.
[00:53:17.206 --> 00:53:20.187]  So, when he throws you overboard, that's the rat leaving the sinking ship.
[00:53:21.328 --> 00:53:22.288]  Here is that video.
[00:53:23.234 --> 00:53:25.276]  So you didn't leak anything about the dossier to any media?
[00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:54.748]  No, I mean I talked about it after I left the government, but not during that period, and certainly not between the 6th of January and the 10th when the President-elect himself talked about it.
[00:53:55.588 --> 00:53:58.969]  So you're saying the President-elect himself is the one who put it out there?
[00:53:59.729 --> 00:54:04.430]  Well, it was publicized, if I remember the sequence, it came out.
[00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:09.034]  Uh, after our Trump Tower briefing.
[00:54:09.175 --> 00:54:14.501]  And you know, all our purpose there was to inform him that it was out there.
[00:54:15.061 --> 00:54:22.770]  And I've often wondered, because it's kind of controversial now that we brought this up, that had we not told him about it,
[00:54:23.371 --> 00:54:27.715]  And then he learned about it and we and he learned that the intelligence community knew about it and didn't tell him.
[00:54:27.735 --> 00:54:30.837]  Well, they've been probably been held that we got in tweets for that too.
[00:54:32.098 --> 00:54:34.260]  So I don't understand this.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.463]  You know, I leaked it to CNN.
[00:54:39.625 --> 00:54:40.846]  He works for CNN now.
[00:54:42.082 --> 00:54:42.762]  He's on record.
[00:54:42.802 --> 00:54:44.523]  We've got the article and all the clips right here.
[00:54:44.543 --> 00:54:46.504]  Everybody remembers Clapper did that.
[00:54:46.544 --> 00:54:47.184]  They all did it.
[00:54:47.464 --> 00:54:48.204]  They all bragged.
[00:54:48.244 --> 00:54:49.265]  We got plenty of dirt.
[00:54:49.305 --> 00:54:52.986]  Obama was in the New York Times on the 20th of January 2017.
[00:54:53.026 --> 00:54:53.426]  I was in D.C.
[00:54:58.118 --> 00:55:00.179]  Fifty feet from the President when he was being sworn in.
[00:55:00.199 --> 00:55:04.500]  And I'm sitting there waiting for him to come up, reading the New York Times, tucked under my jacket.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.560]  This very jacket, by the way.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.901]  Funny, I wore this very jacket.
[00:55:07.481 --> 00:55:08.621]  Strangely enough, that's my favorite jacket.
[00:55:09.381 --> 00:55:10.622]  And it's only five, six years.
[00:55:10.642 --> 00:55:11.322]  It's getting holes in it.
[00:55:11.982 --> 00:55:17.704]  But we did a live report before Roger Stone and I went in to the inauguration.
[00:55:18.858 --> 00:55:22.940]  Reading that, where it was intelligence heads, Clapper and others, say they have the information.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.580]  They have the proof.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.340]  They were wiretapping Trump Tower.
[00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:26.161]  All this other stuff.
[00:55:26.401 --> 00:55:28.362]  And then he gets up there and says he never said it.
[00:55:28.402 --> 00:55:30.302]  He's caught red-handed.
[00:55:32.643 --> 00:55:33.964]  He classified a congressional report.
[00:55:34.004 --> 00:55:34.744]  Yeah, it's in the new report.
[00:55:34.784 --> 00:55:35.344]  I should add that.
[00:55:35.684 --> 00:55:37.925]  Clapper lied about dossier leaks to CNN.
[00:55:38.185 --> 00:55:39.426]  Should have opened the whole segment with that.
[00:55:39.706 --> 00:55:40.966]  Congress reporting he lied to them.
[00:55:41.006 --> 00:55:41.767]  Yes, he lied to them.
[00:55:42.327 --> 00:55:45.448]  Lied to Congress about information he shared with CNN on the infamous Steele dossier.
[00:55:47.008 --> 00:55:47.288]  Wow!
[00:55:47.588 --> 00:55:49.650]  But let's play another time he lied to you.
[00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:56.595]  This is five years ago, telling Congress that the NSA has never spied on anyone in the U.S.
[00:55:57.856 --> 00:56:07.883]  This is years after it came out that every phone call, every text message, every email, everything digital is sent through giant hubs at telecoms and then on to the NSA.
[00:56:08.023 --> 00:56:08.904]  So, here it is.
[00:56:10.251 --> 00:56:20.920]  If you could give me a yes or no answer to the question, does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:56:22.301 --> 00:56:22.721]  No, sir.
[00:56:24.202 --> 00:56:24.683]  It does not?
[00:56:26.644 --> 00:56:27.505]  Not wittingly.
[00:56:28.886 --> 00:56:35.432]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.
[00:56:39.378 --> 00:56:43.561]  So, it's like saying a pedophile accidentally grabbed your five-year-old out of your backyard, went and raped him and killed him.
[00:56:43.961 --> 00:56:46.463]  Or Hitler accidentally, you know, launched World War II or whatever.
[00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:49.064]  Or rain accidentally falls on, you know, out of the sky.
[00:56:49.084 --> 00:56:56.729]  Okay, we're gonna start the next hour, get all into the globalists, how to stop them, how to fight back, so much more, just briefly.
[00:56:56.749 --> 00:57:03.974]  If you want to financially support us, we're not funded by Bezos, we're not funded by taxpayer money, we're not funded by stimulus money like NBC, we're funded by you.

[00:57:36.083 --> 00:57:37.164]  That's not patronization.
[00:57:37.184 --> 00:57:38.145]  I'm not patting you on the head.
[00:57:38.685 --> 00:57:39.025]  It's you.
[00:57:39.105 --> 00:57:39.486]  You did it.
[00:57:39.546 --> 00:57:40.727]  So I want to salute you and thank you.
[00:57:41.167 --> 00:57:42.168]  Please think about us every day.

[00:57:57.403 --> 00:58:00.505]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:58:00.545 --> 00:58:01.066]  You're on the air.
[00:58:01.086 --> 00:58:02.247]  Thanks for holding.
[00:58:02.267 --> 00:58:03.127]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:58:03.328 --> 00:58:03.908]  Hey, brother.
[00:58:04.228 --> 00:58:04.588]  Good, man.
[00:58:04.609 --> 00:58:05.409]  Thank you for calling.
[00:58:05.489 --> 00:58:06.030]  Hey, hey.
[00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:10.573]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:58:10.793 --> 00:58:17.138]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro GX.
[00:58:17.158 --> 00:58:18.979]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:24.724]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:58:26.305 --> 00:58:27.486]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:58:27.546 --> 00:58:29.987]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[00:58:30.047 --> 00:58:31.568]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:58:31.948 --> 00:58:33.529]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:58:34.009 --> 00:58:34.730]  And exactly.
[00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:39.052]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:58:39.372 --> 00:58:39.632]  Boom!
[00:58:39.772 --> 00:58:42.614]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:58:42.654 --> 00:58:43.194]  It's amazing.
[00:58:43.254 --> 00:58:44.535]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[00:58:44.615 --> 00:58:47.477]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:58:52.904 --> 00:58:54.265]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:58:54.545 --> 00:58:55.846]  You can't survive without it.
[00:58:56.046 --> 00:58:56.946]  But where do you get it?
[00:58:57.246 --> 00:59:03.010]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:08.933]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:59:09.133 --> 00:59:26.000]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[00:59:28.882 --> 00:59:30.083]  Stainless steel construction.

[00:59:31.384 --> 00:59:32.025]  Low maintenance.
[00:59:32.305 --> 00:59:34.127]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:59:54.306 --> 01:00:00.227]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:18.350]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:22.311]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[01:00:29.257 --> 01:00:30.118]  Alex Jones!
[01:00:30.138 --> 01:00:31.359]  Scum!
[01:00:31.479 --> 01:00:34.802]  Russian scum!
[01:00:34.902 --> 01:00:40.067]  Until war comes to mind.
[01:00:44.271 --> 01:00:45.652]  Your reputation's amazing.
[01:00:46.053 --> 01:00:47.374]  I will not let you down.
[01:00:47.574 --> 01:00:50.417]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:00:55.779 --> 01:01:15.351]  Well, they say the wheels of justice turn slowly, and yes they do, but the arrogance of bureaucracies burns fast, but when it burns away, there's nothing left but a bunch of little cowards who got themselves all wound up because they were accustomed to power, didn't understand the people had voted their asses out.
[01:01:16.286 --> 01:01:19.688]  Yes, in most major elections it doesn't really count much, but with Trump it does.
[01:01:20.348 --> 01:01:28.772]  That's why you've seen the conniption fits, the hysterics, the insanity, the crazy lies, the distortions, the bullying, the boycotts, the attacks, the subterfuge.
[01:01:29.492 --> 01:01:36.755]  Because an entire corrupt establishment for decades had hijacked this country and had been mismanaging it into the ground.
[01:01:37.775 --> 01:01:38.616]  Along came Trump.
[01:01:40.276 --> 01:01:44.058]  And the patriot elements of the Pentagon and intelligence agencies.
[01:01:44.438 --> 01:01:45.899]  You don't just think it's Trump, do you?
[01:01:46.859 --> 01:01:54.123]  And along came a consortium of patriots who've been working in some cases for 60 years to stop the globalists.
[01:01:56.149 --> 01:02:21.193]  I'm only on organic extension, not some secret agency, not some secret orders, not some black op training center when I was 10 years old, but simply growing up in Texas as Americana around men who'd fought for the country and who knew the score, knew understand who the Globalists were, and who simply talked about what they knew in front of me as a young boy.
[01:02:22.577 --> 01:02:23.537]  And so I studied history.
[01:02:24.437 --> 01:02:25.318]  I found out they were right.
[01:02:25.978 --> 01:02:29.559]  And I sat there and decided when I was 12, 13 years old, I was going to take them on.
[01:02:30.919 --> 01:02:32.259]  That's what destiny's all about.
[01:02:33.359 --> 01:02:35.200]  They don't want you to think you've got destiny.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.620]  Yeah, half the time when I cover, here's a train wreck.
[01:02:39.101 --> 01:02:39.601]  Doesn't matter.
[01:02:39.641 --> 01:02:40.661]  I'm swinging for the fences.
[01:02:40.701 --> 01:02:41.681]  I'm going in the right direction.
[01:02:41.721 --> 01:02:42.701]  I care about justice.
[01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:43.401]  I want freedom.
[01:02:44.462 --> 01:02:46.802]  And they don't know what to do in the deep state.
[01:02:49.183 --> 01:02:50.303]  Trump was recruited.
[01:02:54.093 --> 01:02:55.355]  By patriots in the government.
[01:02:56.217 --> 01:02:58.621]  To stop the total humiliation of the country.
[01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:00.825]  We've already sold out to China.
[01:03:01.927 --> 01:03:04.512]  We're already crippled psychologically, culturally, mentally.
[01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:07.297]  We're already in destitute shape.
[01:03:09.957 --> 01:03:12.978]  But the globalists wanted to fully have a civil war, a race-based war.
[01:03:13.318 --> 01:03:17.640]  They wanted to break us completely and have re-education camps and everything else.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.740]  It was even coming out in the news.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.061]  Not just me covering it.
[01:03:20.581 --> 01:03:22.802]  And patriots in our own government said the people are awake.
[01:03:23.162 --> 01:03:24.162]  They want something different.
[01:03:24.682 --> 01:03:25.643]  Let's try to stop this.
[01:03:25.663 --> 01:03:26.803]  This is unbelievably bad.
[01:03:27.183 --> 01:03:27.963]  Rigging debates.
[01:03:27.983 --> 01:03:29.504]  They want to arrest all the conservatives.
[01:03:29.804 --> 01:03:31.184]  They want to break up families.
[01:03:31.204 --> 01:03:32.445]  They want to have the state run everything.
[01:03:32.825 --> 01:03:34.025]  This is a horrible system.
[01:03:34.085 --> 01:03:34.886]  Why would we do this?
[01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:37.687]  So some Hollywood and globalist elites
[01:03:38.487 --> 01:03:42.170]  Like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and some of the others have their way with us.
[01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:43.571]  We're not doing this.
[01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:53.457]  So right now, Trump is really like a desperate rearguard action, hoping while he stalls them, you wake up and do something.
[01:03:53.517 --> 01:04:07.427]  And from Romania, to Hungary, to Iceland, to Brazil, to Japan, to areas of Africa, to all over the world, from Catalan Spain, to you name it.
[01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:10.284]  They'd say, cot the lawn, cot the lawn, Mr. Jones.
[01:04:10.364 --> 01:04:10.685]  I get it.
[01:04:10.705 --> 01:04:12.705]  I gotta say it geographically for folks listening.
[01:04:14.045 --> 01:04:14.786]  People get it.
[01:04:15.306 --> 01:04:16.846]  They say, listen, our local governments aren't perfect.
[01:04:17.006 --> 01:04:19.687]  But they're not run by some guy like Jeff Bezos who's tax exempt.
[01:04:20.307 --> 01:04:21.708]  Who makes 12 billion dollars a day.
[01:04:22.308 --> 01:04:25.529]  While they tell me on the news I'm rich if I make a million dollars a year.
[01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.649]  And then pay 40% of it in taxes.
[01:04:27.689 --> 01:04:28.829]  And then the other lawyers.
[01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:30.730]  Trying to hire people.
[01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:31.590]  Trying to run something.
[01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:33.871]  Trying to do something.
[01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:34.111]  Show!
[01:04:35.885 --> 01:04:42.390]  That's what it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is the boys from the men, the women from the girls, which side you want to be on.
[01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:44.772]  But I am very proud to be part of this giant awakening.
[01:04:45.532 --> 01:04:54.980]  I'm very proud of what we're all doing together and standing against the incredible arrogance of Clapper and all these other crooks that thought they'd tell all these lies and do all these things and get away with it because they thought they were invincible.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.681]  They thought they'd beaten us.
[01:04:56.721 --> 01:04:57.842]  They didn't know we were asleep.
[01:04:58.362 --> 01:04:59.883]  We're awake now, Clapper!
[01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:01.324]  We're awake, Brennan!
[01:05:03.729 --> 01:05:06.511]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:05:07.151 --> 01:05:10.693]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:05:11.113 --> 01:05:14.055]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:05:14.455 --> 01:05:16.436]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:21.399]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:23.800]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:30.444]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:05:31.084 --> 01:05:38.286]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:05:39.266 --> 01:05:43.927]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:05:44.327 --> 01:05:51.289]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:05:51.969 --> 01:05:56.437]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:06.150]  Breaking the conditioning!
[01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.190]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:08.011]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:08.791]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.891 --> 01:06:09.512]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:12.534]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.574 --> 01:06:22.159]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:23.940]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.783]  It's time to confirm there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[01:06:29.467 --> 01:06:33.909]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:36.650]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:39.531]  It was almost as if there were planned implosions.
[01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:40.931]  It's just pancakes.
[01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:45.253]  They took the babies out of incubators, and left the children to die on the front lines.
[01:06:46.513 --> 01:06:48.435]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[01:06:48.535 --> 01:06:55.580]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[01:06:55.601 --> 01:06:55.841]  U.S.A.
[01:06:55.921 --> 01:06:58.963]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:01.645]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[01:07:01.665 --> 01:07:03.346]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[01:07:03.907 --> 01:07:04.868]  Some former U.S.
[01:07:04.948 --> 01:07:06.669]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:07:06.709 --> 01:07:10.272]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:07:10.512 --> 01:07:16.076]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:07:16.156 --> 01:07:17.476]  Russian scum!
[01:07:17.677 --> 01:07:18.477]  Denied everything.
[01:07:18.517 --> 01:07:20.278]  He called it all fake news.
[01:07:20.298 --> 01:07:22.900]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.081]  This is a national emergency.
[01:07:25.161 --> 01:07:30.625]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:07:30.685 --> 01:07:32.446]  This is a FEMA high-level emergency.
[01:07:33.187 --> 01:07:35.808]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:41.573]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Wikileaks?
[01:07:41.993 --> 01:07:44.675]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[01:07:44.855 --> 01:07:46.696]  If they can shut us down, you're next!
[01:07:47.777 --> 01:07:51.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:07:52.581 --> 01:07:54.162]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:56.676 --> 01:08:01.860]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we are now well into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.543]  I'm not going to air this whole 10-minute piece until towards the end of the hour.
[01:08:05.563 --> 01:08:08.886]  But we're going to air about a minute or so of it here in just a moment.
[01:08:09.647 --> 01:08:12.509]  Alex Jones confronted by Bezos, thugs.
[01:08:12.909 --> 01:08:13.590]  I'd say thugs.
[01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:17.493]  Only one of the security guys seemed to be in charge at Whole Foods was a jerk.
[01:08:17.874 --> 01:08:20.356]  He was already standing on the corner of the property, off the property.
[01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:22.257]  He came over and said, get out of here.
[01:08:22.297 --> 01:08:22.957]  I'm calling the police.
[01:08:22.997 --> 01:08:25.659]  And I said, well, I can go in your parking garage and get my car.
[01:08:25.739 --> 01:08:26.520]  He wouldn't answer that.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.983]  Made me think I was gonna get arrested when I went down there to get my car and followed me to my car.
[01:08:31.043 --> 01:08:31.824]  So I'm coming back.
[01:08:32.344 --> 01:08:33.305]  I'm already planning to come back.
[01:08:33.345 --> 01:08:34.826]  But now, coming back a lot.
[01:08:34.946 --> 01:08:36.347]  Because people were polite to me.
[01:08:36.387 --> 01:08:37.067]  They were nice to me.
[01:08:37.468 --> 01:08:39.129]  Most of the folks in Whole Foods were listeners.
[01:08:40.089 --> 01:08:42.231]  In big blue state Austin.
[01:08:43.692 --> 01:08:44.793]  Blue state cancer Austin.
[01:08:46.107 --> 01:08:48.930]  But you try to stop me and bully me, I'm coming back.
[01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:52.032]  That's coming up later in the hour.
[01:08:52.693 --> 01:08:54.695]  Because I've got a bunch of other things I want to get to.
[01:08:54.715 --> 01:08:56.396]  I want to get into Trump on Kanye.
[01:08:56.416 --> 01:08:57.537]  He says Kanye gets it.
[01:08:58.218 --> 01:09:00.580]  And how they're trying to bully Kanye and that major...
[01:09:02.045 --> 01:09:07.990]  Bellwether, also MSNBC guest, says Mike Pence would put gay people in concentration camps if he became the president.
[01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.753]  Well, Trump disappointed a gay ambassador to Germany.
[01:09:11.033 --> 01:09:11.874]  Nobody's ever done that.
[01:09:11.974 --> 01:09:15.057]  And I'm not trying to, like, win points here or something.
[01:09:15.137 --> 01:09:19.360]  It's that Trump's incredibly inclusive and wants Americana.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:29.690]  And as the economy comes back, and as he gets this big peace deal, I mean, North and South just agreed to sign an armistice that will then go into a total peace deal and end the war, or end the armistice.
[01:09:30.690 --> 01:09:34.974]  You've got huge things happening because the globalists wanted a strategy of tension.
[01:09:35.234 --> 01:09:46.843]  I know you're a veteran yourself and understand strategies of tension, but like Trump said when he was with Merkel on Friday, he said, we are going to move away from playing games and keeping crises going.
[01:09:47.464 --> 01:09:51.607]  Yeah, and what a lot of people don't get is the strategies that Trump employs.
[01:09:51.707 --> 01:09:57.652]  Trump understands how Russians and Chinese and these other eastern nations negotiate because
[01:09:58.132 --> 01:10:04.558]  Western Europe, like Germany, you know, Obama negotiated and he conducted diplomacy like Merkel and like Macron would.
[01:10:04.838 --> 01:10:13.647]  He doesn't understand that there's a way you have to put pressure on Russia and China and North Korea, those other nations, because that's what they respect and that's how they respond to pressure.
[01:10:13.687 --> 01:10:16.469]  It's a respect game and that's what people like Obama don't understand.
[01:10:16.489 --> 01:10:20.813]  So when Trump is putting pressure on these people, he's actually understanding the proper way to operate.
[01:10:21.454 --> 01:10:35.041]  And I would expand on that, by pressure, serious sanctions on the regime itself, a year and a half of that, and then saying, but here's the carrot, merge with South Korea, have a new business deal, really go into the future, but give up your nuclear weapons.
[01:10:35.102 --> 01:10:44.287]  And as I reported over a month ago from our sources, they already, Jake Lloyd, had agreed to that, and now you see Kim Jong Un, it's come out, has already agreed to that.
[01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:46.408]  Yeah, he's already agreed to it.
[01:10:47.955 --> 01:10:52.451]  What people, I mean five months ago, it was five months ago that people thought that we were going to go to...
[01:10:54.235 --> 01:10:55.856]  Nuclear conflict with North Korea.
[01:10:56.116 --> 01:11:01.998]  And now five months later, like you said, North and South Korea, they're talking, they're about to end the 60-some year armistice.
[01:11:02.238 --> 01:11:03.678]  They're about to come to peace.
[01:11:03.698 --> 01:11:06.499]  There's probably going to be massive infrastructure deals where they're reuniting.
[01:11:06.759 --> 01:11:08.840]  They're building highways and stuff between the two cities.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.300]  North Korea is going to be brought out of poverty.
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:18.683]  And it's all due to the efforts by President Trump when he was putting pressure, like you said, massive sanctions, but also talking about fire and fury.
[01:11:19.083 --> 01:11:21.004]  And I would say that probably going forward,
[01:11:21.983 --> 01:11:25.485]  I'm predicting that the same strategy is going to be employed with Iran.
[01:11:25.505 --> 01:11:34.550]  We're going to see a similar thing because Trump, with Syria and everything, he demonstrated that he's willing to, you know, we don't like the Syria bombings, but he's willing to go against what Russia says.
[01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:38.031]  So that's going to allow him to put pressure on Iran.
[01:11:38.572 --> 01:11:43.014]  And I think that we're going to see a massive reworking of the Iran deal to include the whole Middle East.
[01:11:43.334 --> 01:11:46.375]  Sure, well I got what Trump was doing on the whole chemical weapons thing.
[01:11:46.415 --> 01:11:48.676]  They've got the White Helmets caught now four times.
[01:11:48.696 --> 01:11:50.037]  In fact, that's in the news this week.
[01:11:50.057 --> 01:11:59.521]  They have all the witnesses, the kids that were brought in from school and doused in water are all in the news saying, we were told it was a fake chemical attack, we were given candy, we were given lunch.
[01:11:59.921 --> 01:12:02.502]  I mean, this is all coming out that they staged that thing.
[01:12:03.002 --> 01:12:05.823]  But I understand Trump's face with that, he'll look weak if he doesn't strike.
[01:12:06.263 --> 01:12:08.964]  So he strikes some of these bases, gives the Russians time to get out.
[01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:10.445]  The Russians are already trying to pull out.
[01:12:10.725 --> 01:12:12.806]  That looks strong to Iran, but let's pull back from that.
[01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:19.907]  The mainstream media said it was the end of the world and that we were going to have nuclear war even two weeks ago.
[01:12:19.927 --> 01:12:26.013]  The View, Joy Behar, all of them said Trump's going to cause a nuclear war, that Kim Jong-un is good compared to our president.
[01:12:26.513 --> 01:12:29.436]  Now, they're not even reporting on how big a deal this is.
[01:12:30.177 --> 01:12:39.503]  Yeah, well, and now what they're saying, even though, you know, like I said five months ago, like you're talking about just a couple weeks ago, Trump was the cause of every negative thing in North Korea.
[01:12:39.523 --> 01:12:41.385]  It was his fault that we were about to go to nuclear war.
[01:12:41.685 --> 01:12:44.987]  It's his fault that all these bad, you know, supposedly bad things are happening.
[01:12:45.267 --> 01:12:47.409]  And now, like you said, good things are happening.
[01:12:47.429 --> 01:12:50.651]  And they want to put the credit on Prime Minister Moon of South Korea.
[01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:52.712]  They want to put it on Xi Jinping of China.
[01:12:52.732 --> 01:12:54.413]  They want to give all the credit to everybody else.
[01:12:54.693 --> 01:12:59.917]  And there is some element of credit due to them, even though Trump was the one pressuring China to pressure North Korea.
[01:13:00.197 --> 01:13:02.618]  But they want to take all of the credit away from us.
[01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:05.359]  I mean, I'd say 90% goes to the U.S.
[01:13:05.439 --> 01:13:08.061]  Russia had a big piece in actually saying they might back a U.S.
[01:13:08.081 --> 01:13:10.322]  strike if Kim Jong-un didn't stop what he was doing.
[01:13:10.502 --> 01:13:13.263]  But expanding on that, pull back from this.
[01:13:15.506 --> 01:13:16.787]  1953 is when this ended.
[01:13:17.408 --> 01:13:20.290]  The war was still going with a ceasefire versus 2018.
[01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:22.371]  That's 60 plus years.
[01:13:22.692 --> 01:13:25.053]  That never got fixed until now.
[01:13:25.374 --> 01:13:27.235]  So it did change because of real sanctions.
[01:13:27.515 --> 01:13:30.017]  The globalists on record wanted a strategy of tension.
[01:13:30.557 --> 01:13:35.281]  It was Clinton and others that gave the nuclear weapons and missiles to North Korea to destabilize things.
[01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:37.683]  Trump is ending all this Machiavellian crap.
[01:13:38.183 --> 01:13:52.599]  I mean most Americans like this is something that hasn't we haven't been at peace with Korea in most Americans living history it's an enormous monumental thing and like you're talking about with the the strategy of tension and everything that keeps the globalist
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:02.504]  One world government plans in order because then it requires organizations like the EU and it requires organizations like the UN to come in and try to fix things even though they don't.
[01:14:02.544 --> 01:14:16.569]  And that's what David Rockefeller's dad said with the League of Nations then the UN that the Rockefellers built in New York on their own land was about a strategy of ongoing tension where you need them running things these multinational groups instead of unilaterally nations making deal to deal.
[01:14:16.829 --> 01:14:20.191]  You can have 50 countries making a deal they've just got to do it unilaterally.
[01:14:20.591 --> 01:14:22.352]  Exactly and what what
[01:14:23.152 --> 01:14:29.375]  I don't think a lot of people get is that Trump, you know, whatever, whatever his strategies are on a lot of stuff, whether you love him or hate him, he's transcending.
[01:14:29.675 --> 01:14:34.617]  It's possible to transcend that order of requiring a new, like, a world government.
[01:14:34.697 --> 01:14:38.059]  And that's why the bureaucrats are so pissed, because he's being the president.
[01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:39.840]  Does that mean I agree with everything he does as president?
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:39.900]  No!
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:42.161]  Do I agree with him being the president?
[01:14:42.522 --> 01:14:54.132]  We're turning power back to the presidency, back to Congress, back to the states, back to the people as he promised to do a year and a half ago on January 20th, 2017 at that inauguration.
[01:14:54.172 --> 01:14:56.654]  He said, we're transferring it back to you.
[01:14:56.914 --> 01:14:58.376]  We're going back to the Republic.
[01:14:58.856 --> 01:15:00.477]  They had to do one-sided deals.
[01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:01.563]  This is
[01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:22.005]  Jeff Bezos.
[01:15:22.085 --> 01:15:25.046]  Bezos gets, you know, $140 billion, and this guy gets that.
[01:15:25.327 --> 01:15:27.328]  The globalism's been a lie.
[01:15:27.348 --> 01:15:37.254]  It's been a new form of robber baron colonialism, where they're now using, in their own words, the third world populations to recolonize us, but not to empower us, but to drive us down as well.
[01:15:37.854 --> 01:15:38.294]  Exactly.
[01:15:38.374 --> 01:15:43.198]  What, you know, it's important to realize that, like it says in the Bible, if you're not with us, you're against us.
[01:15:43.258 --> 01:15:51.183]  It's the same because every action that Trump carries out that's not out of the New World Order playbook, it's an action to re-establish national sovereignty for the U.S.
[01:15:51.383 --> 01:15:52.524]  And that's what I 100% agree with.
[01:15:52.784 --> 01:15:55.126]  And I agree with 95% of what Trump's done.
[01:15:55.866 --> 01:15:57.807]  It's a very, very dangerous game, but he is real.
[01:15:57.867 --> 01:15:59.228]  You know him by his enemies, folks.
[01:15:59.669 --> 01:16:00.890]  That's why we defend him so much.

[01:17:02.762 --> 01:17:10.449]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:15.374]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:17:15.894 --> 01:17:18.236]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:17:19.017 --> 01:17:22.140]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:17:23.652 --> 01:17:35.780]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:51.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[01:18:08.844 --> 01:18:12.147]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:18:12.987 --> 01:18:20.274]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[01:18:21.014 --> 01:18:27.360]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:33.425]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:18:34.025 --> 01:18:46.156]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[01:18:46.616 --> 01:18:50.697]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.

[01:20:06.278 --> 01:20:17.790]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.795 --> 01:20:29.081]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:34.295 --> 01:20:37.678]  All right, I went down to Whole Foods Worldwide headquarters today.
[01:20:37.718 --> 01:20:39.039]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[01:20:39.459 --> 01:20:40.360]  Jake Lloyd was with me.
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.922]  Rex Jones, my son, wanted to go.
[01:20:42.942 --> 01:20:45.003]  I said, you can go, but I'm going to leave you out of this one.
[01:20:45.323 --> 01:20:46.985]  Sure enough, he ends up, you know, with his points.
[01:20:47.265 --> 01:20:48.486]  He's 15 going on 16.
[01:20:48.526 --> 01:20:49.006]  He's a man.
[01:20:49.026 --> 01:20:50.307]  He's already six feet tall.
[01:20:50.327 --> 01:20:51.148]  He's smart as I am.
[01:20:51.168 --> 01:20:52.589]  So he's going to be on air more with us.
[01:20:52.609 --> 01:20:53.990]  You know, the media makes a big deal out of it.
[01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:56.312]  Like, David Hogg can be on air, but Rex Jones can't.
[01:20:57.119 --> 01:20:58.580]  So, good luck with that.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.222]  Rex is here to stay.
[01:21:00.562 --> 01:21:04.105]  The fact that folks are trying to keep him off air, I think it's actually only been encouraging.
[01:21:04.145 --> 01:21:10.850]  But Jake Lloyd, I wanted to briefly, in this segment, get with viewers into how we're under attack.
[01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:23.541]  Now, I don't get up here like some SJW saying, I'm a victim, I want victim status, I'm a big baby, look at poor little me.
[01:21:24.557 --> 01:21:27.500]  No, I'm saying I'm trying to be a warrior for this country politically.
[01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:29.922]  I'm standing up for what's right.
[01:21:30.002 --> 01:21:32.505]  We have delivered big time in waking up the public.
[01:21:32.585 --> 01:21:35.628]  You've delivered big time as an audience, our affiliates, our sponsors.
[01:21:35.648 --> 01:21:36.188]  You're amazing.
[01:21:36.568 --> 01:21:38.991]  So the praise, 90% of it goes to you.
[01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:41.233]  The rest goes to this crew and what we're doing here.
[01:21:42.954 --> 01:21:45.957]  That said, a lot of this is off record.
[01:21:46.097 --> 01:21:46.938]  I went to D.C.
[01:21:47.279 --> 01:21:47.939]  for four days.
[01:21:48.956 --> 01:21:53.118]  Three weeks ago and I can't get into most of what I was there was not what you saw me there for.
[01:21:53.758 --> 01:21:55.078]  And that was all secondary.
[01:21:55.739 --> 01:21:58.580]  And I met with some high level folks.
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.520]  I'll leave it to you at that.
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:00.801]  I'm sure you can figure it out.
[01:22:01.281 --> 01:22:01.641]  High level.
[01:22:02.781 --> 01:22:04.502]  And they said they gave me the analysis.
[01:22:04.522 --> 01:22:05.483]  They gave me the intel.
[01:22:06.243 --> 01:22:08.224]  And I was told not to get into obviously all of it.
[01:22:08.264 --> 01:22:11.005]  But I can tell you that we've already pointed this out.
[01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:13.826]  There's 15 million a year.
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:19.521]  Spent by Soros just to fake media to dig up lies on us.
[01:22:20.021 --> 01:22:21.041]  They can't find anything.
[01:22:21.081 --> 01:22:22.662]  They've gone down to our reporters now.
[01:22:23.342 --> 01:22:25.002]  Six months on Paul Watson in England.
[01:22:25.602 --> 01:22:27.323]  They had like a three-person team on him.
[01:22:28.963 --> 01:22:30.463]  This is like a movie, but it's real.
[01:22:30.823 --> 01:22:38.905]  So you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that we are fighting because we know we're under attack.
[01:22:39.861 --> 01:22:44.503]  Not because we're angels, not because we're perfect, but because we don't want to be under a Nazi collaborator's control.
[01:22:45.244 --> 01:22:59.071]  So, Zero Hedge reports on links to the Federalist and leaked documents that Congress has put out this week in their intelligence report of the latest Strzok page garbage.
[01:23:00.268 --> 01:23:05.192]  Mystery group of wealthy donors with US generals over it at the meetings.
[01:23:05.912 --> 01:23:14.359]  So they're going to hotels with sitting US generals that are running and honchoing all this to try to stop Donald Trump.
[01:23:14.379 --> 01:23:17.901]  Now that's just one tranche, one group of the money.
[01:23:18.942 --> 01:23:24.006]  Mystery group of wealthy donors and Soros spends 50 million for private Trump Russia investigation.
[01:23:24.046 --> 01:23:24.787]  That's after
[01:23:26.033 --> 01:23:27.913]  It came out, the FBI was funding it.
[01:23:28.193 --> 01:23:29.094]  This is in the last year.
[01:23:30.254 --> 01:23:31.394]  50 million.
[01:23:32.334 --> 01:23:35.855]  Soros puts out 15 million a year, according to my sources.
[01:23:38.296 --> 01:23:41.216]  So these reporters, and I've even had reporters apologize to me off record.
[01:23:41.236 --> 01:23:44.957]  They go, no man, but I mean, I want the 200 grand or whatever, you know, I mean, this is going on.
[01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:48.738]  So, and I'm lucky they're not sending hit teams down here, but if they do that, that's fine too.
[01:23:49.098 --> 01:23:53.779]  I don't want to die, but if anything happens to me, Hillary, Soros, the globalists, they're the main suspects.
[01:23:55.066 --> 01:23:57.167]  And I don't say that to act tough or to challenge him.
[01:23:57.247 --> 01:23:58.248]  It's like, I'm in a war.
[01:23:59.008 --> 01:23:59.689]  These are criminals.
[01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:03.951]  In third world countries, if they can get away with it, they engage in massive atrocities.
[01:24:05.232 --> 01:24:09.634]  But I raise this because The Observer is owned by Jared Kushner.
[01:24:11.075 --> 01:24:17.399]  Now, I'm not even going to attack Jared Kushner, because I can't figure out whether he's really good or really neutral or really bad.
[01:24:18.779 --> 01:24:19.660]  I tend to trust Trump.
[01:24:20.771 --> 01:24:26.055]  So, I'm not in some White House intrigue about who I support or who I don't support, okay?
[01:24:26.775 --> 01:24:28.237]  Early on, I got sucked into some of that.
[01:24:28.277 --> 01:24:29.497]  I'm not into that, okay?
[01:24:31.619 --> 01:24:33.581]  But the Observer is owned by a trust.
[01:24:33.621 --> 01:24:37.283]  He no longer controls it for you, so that's hopefully good news about Jared Kushner.
[01:24:38.264 --> 01:24:41.226]  And I went to it today, because there was a bunch of articles attacking me the last month.
[01:24:42.807 --> 01:24:44.649]  And it says Trump's a Russian agent.
[01:24:45.389 --> 01:24:46.330]  Trump's going down.
[01:24:48.011 --> 01:24:48.552]  It says.
[01:24:49.656 --> 01:24:50.476]  Pissgate's real.
[01:24:50.937 --> 01:24:52.818]  I mean, not even the Daily Beast says that now.
[01:24:54.879 --> 01:24:56.400]  Not even BuzzFeed that made it up.
[01:24:58.181 --> 01:24:59.261]  Put up a fake reporting on it.
[01:24:59.641 --> 01:25:00.762]  They admit it's not true now.
[01:25:01.642 --> 01:25:08.286]  So I go to this story that says what Peter Thiel's playbook shows us about taking down Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:25:09.927 --> 01:25:13.409]  Now notice, taking down Alex Jones and Trump, or Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:25:14.861 --> 01:25:19.324]  And they admit that the Democrats in Deep State are funding fake lawsuits against us to shut us down.
[01:25:20.344 --> 01:25:21.004]  Well, here's the difference.
[01:25:23.466 --> 01:25:31.630]  I didn't videotape in my personal home my wife climbing on top Hulk Hogan.
[01:25:34.452 --> 01:25:35.793]  I think Hulk Hogan's pretty cool, by the way.
[01:25:36.933 --> 01:25:37.714]  I'm told he's a listener.
[01:25:38.554 --> 01:25:39.635]  The point is, is that
[01:25:42.611 --> 01:25:45.353]  If I did that, I deserve to get in big trouble.
[01:25:46.354 --> 01:25:49.636]  I'm not getting buddies over to my house to have sex with my wife and videotaping it.
[01:25:49.956 --> 01:25:50.657]  I'm not Gawker.
[01:25:51.097 --> 01:25:54.479]  But they say that's the model, and they admit it's lawfare to destroy us.
[01:25:54.539 --> 01:25:59.923]  So the Observer, even five years ago, three years ago, did some pretty good reporting.
[01:26:00.043 --> 01:26:01.164]  It's bad news now.
[01:26:02.245 --> 01:26:06.668]  And so I got Kushner saying I deserve his publication to be basically out of business.
[01:26:07.949 --> 01:26:09.190]  And then his father-in-law,
[01:26:12.503 --> 01:26:14.704]  He's a criminal that women urinate on.
[01:26:15.744 --> 01:26:16.845]  That was on their front page today.
[01:26:16.945 --> 01:26:22.567]  So, I guess that means Kushner really doesn't run it anymore.
[01:26:22.848 --> 01:26:24.388]  But my God, who'd you hand it over to?
[01:26:24.428 --> 01:26:29.230]  I mean, you know, it's like, because I know the stuff about me isn't true, but at least they're being honest about it.
[01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.511]  It's not Peter Thiel suing us, by the way.
[01:26:30.531 --> 01:26:30.991]  He's a good guy.
[01:26:31.271 --> 01:26:32.172]  He would defend victims.
[01:26:32.532 --> 01:26:39.475]  This is them making stuff up using lawfare, and they admit if they can do it to Infowars, just as they had a news course said two months ago, they could do it to everybody.
[01:26:41.027 --> 01:26:42.969]  So I wanted to show everybody that to understand.
[01:26:43.009 --> 01:26:47.113]  It's not like we're losers here and we're bitching and complaining saying send us money.
[01:26:47.433 --> 01:26:54.861]  The NRA has broken all fundraising records with David Hogg attacking him saying ban the Second Amendment, all this stuff.
[01:26:56.222 --> 01:26:58.244]  Well, you know, I get attacked along with the NRA.
[01:26:58.845 --> 01:27:01.507]  I get sued like the NRA and our donations are not up.
[01:27:02.548 --> 01:27:03.850]  Our buying of products is not up.
[01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:04.671]  It's not an election year.
[01:27:05.469 --> 01:27:06.670]  I mean, last year wasn't an election year.
[01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:08.972]  This really isn't, because it's kind of the midterms.
[01:27:09.012 --> 01:27:10.653]  But it's not a main election year.
[01:27:11.033 --> 01:27:11.934]  Not a general election.
[01:27:13.135 --> 01:27:14.396]  So I'm not complaining here.
[01:27:14.496 --> 01:27:15.637]  I mean, I want this.
[01:27:15.737 --> 01:27:16.397]  I stood up for this.
[01:27:16.417 --> 01:27:16.738]  I'm doing this.
[01:27:16.758 --> 01:27:19.300]  But you understand, the globalists are obsessed with Infowars.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:20.801]  They want us shut down.
[01:27:21.642 --> 01:27:22.702]  They want us destroyed.
[01:27:23.623 --> 01:27:24.484]  And they admit
[01:27:25.526 --> 01:27:33.914]  In this big lengthy article that they want to take down Trump and Infowars because we quote, can't be stopped and are bringing populism back to America.
[01:27:34.354 --> 01:27:36.356]  They're such globalists they admit who we are.
[01:27:36.416 --> 01:27:44.023]  They go, these horrible nationalists, these free market people and they're not elitist like us and we've got to destroy them and the only way is to sue them.
[01:27:46.138 --> 01:27:47.879]  Why don't you just get out of the way and be rich?
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.080]  In America, you jerks!
[01:27:50.881 --> 01:27:54.083]  And let people have nice apartments and nice houses and their children.
[01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:55.564]  No, you've got to run everything.
[01:27:55.604 --> 01:28:01.307]  It's all about your power because... I always read this in Philosophy Carl Reunion, you name it.
[01:28:01.347 --> 01:28:03.108]  I was looking at Jordan Peterson videos this morning.
[01:28:03.308 --> 01:28:05.890]  So I haven't really paid attention to him until he's bigger and bigger.
[01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:10.913]  So I watched a bunch of them this morning and he was saying, weak men cannot be virtuous or strong.
[01:28:11.694 --> 01:28:13.435]  Weak men cannot be leaders.
[01:28:14.295 --> 01:28:23.561]  And it's because they're rats and always want to screw somebody over, but it's strong men who have the evil side, but also the good side that's bigger, who understand things and don't want to be a jerk.
[01:28:23.701 --> 01:28:26.523]  It is the bad people that want to pull down somebody like Trump.
[01:28:26.543 --> 01:28:28.284]  So when we come back, Jake Lloyd, we'll talk about this.
[01:28:28.744 --> 01:28:30.965]  But the bottom line, there it is.
[01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:32.046]  Weak men can't be virtuous.
[01:28:32.066 --> 01:28:32.847]  That was the actual quote.
[01:28:33.787 --> 01:28:34.548]  Good job pulling that up.
[01:28:35.473 --> 01:28:37.274]  Is that I'm really trying to build something.
[01:28:37.634 --> 01:28:40.616]  Psychopaths think I'm a schmuck or crazy that I believe in you.
[01:28:41.077 --> 01:28:43.358]  And because I'm strong, I'm not screwing you over.
[01:28:43.378 --> 01:28:44.339]  I must be a schmuck.
[01:28:44.739 --> 01:28:46.260]  Or I have Texas hospitality.
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:49.602]  Somebody I bring into town and they get in my face and tell me I'm their bitch.
[01:28:50.502 --> 01:28:52.564]  I have Texas hospitality because I'm a killer.
[01:28:52.624 --> 01:28:53.284]  I'm not bragging.
[01:28:53.544 --> 01:28:54.465]  I'll rip your head off.
[01:28:54.505 --> 01:28:56.166]  I'll kill you if I need to.
[01:28:56.626 --> 01:28:57.947]  The point is I'm a loving person.
[01:28:57.987 --> 01:28:58.928]  That balances me out.
[01:28:59.148 --> 01:29:00.289]  You cowards don't get it.
[01:29:00.349 --> 01:29:00.769]  We'll be back.
[01:29:04.670 --> 01:29:05.130]  Good morning.
[01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:06.671]  My name is Andrew Grossman.
[01:29:07.071 --> 01:29:12.993]  I'm a partner at the law firm Baker Hostetler, and I represent Alex and InfoWars in the lawsuit that was filed by Brendan Gilmore.
[01:29:13.293 --> 01:29:22.016]  This morning, we asked the District Court to dismiss Mr. Gilmore's lawsuit, to require Mr. Gilmore to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding to his lawsuit,
[01:29:22.396 --> 01:29:27.322]  And to sanction Mr. Gilmour for using a federal court to wage a publicity stunt.
[01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:28.884]  Now let me be clear about this.
[01:29:29.284 --> 01:29:33.009]  Mr. Gilmour's claims against Alex Jones and Infowars are legally defective.
[01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:36.533]  We are confident that the suit will be thrown out of court.
[01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:40.517]  But make no mistake, vexatious lawsuits like this one are dangerous.
[01:29:41.218 --> 01:29:43.879]  Because they seek to chip away at our cherished First Amendment rights.
[01:29:44.319 --> 01:29:47.920]  The First Amendment gives all Americans the right to have their say on today's news.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:57.583]  Alex Jones thought it was strange that Mr. Gilmour was popping up in all the media coverage on the events in Charlottesville, with what seemed like the same anti-Trump talking points every time.
[01:29:57.703 --> 01:30:00.543]  And that is exactly what Mr. Jones questioned.
[01:30:00.583 --> 01:30:05.685]  Was the media, with Mr. Gilmour's eager assistance, spinning the story against President Trump?
[01:30:06.505 --> 01:30:14.735]  That is the kind of probing question that every cable news analyst, every columnist, and every American who cares about what's going on in this country asks every day.
[01:30:15.356 --> 01:30:19.080]  They try to make sense of what they see reported in the news, and then they say what they think.
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:22.284]  The First Amendment absolutely protects that speech.
[01:30:22.644 --> 01:30:23.986]  Now, Mr. Gilmour disagrees.
[01:30:24.626 --> 01:30:27.968]  He obviously opposes Alex Jones's political viewpoint.
[01:30:28.448 --> 01:30:33.670]  He says that InfoWars is not what he considers to be responsible journalism, and that it can therefore be suppressed.
[01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:40.533]  His lawyers say that the law should distinguish between speech that informs the public, and speech that they think misinforms the public.
[01:30:41.033 --> 01:30:50.240]  But the whole point of the First Amendment is that people like Mr. Gilmour and his lawyers do not get to decide whether their political opponents are allowed to have a voice.
[01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:54.424]  They do not get to decide what the public is allowed to hear.
[01:30:54.964 --> 01:31:01.349]  That fundamental misunderstanding of our First Amendment rights is just one of the reasons that Mr. Gilmour's suit has to be thrown out.
[01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:09.916]  As a matter of principle, no one should be able to drag their political opponents into court as a publicity stunt to harass them for their protected speech.
[01:31:10.476 --> 01:31:17.843]  That kind of abuse must have consequences, so that when people like Mr. Gilmour are thinking about filing suit, they think first before they do so.
[01:31:18.304 --> 01:31:25.451]  And that's why we're asking the court to find that Mr. Gilmour's lawsuit is what the law calls a strategic lawsuit against public participation.
[01:31:25.951 --> 01:31:32.317]  If the court agrees, Mr. Gilmour will be required to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding.
[01:31:33.218 --> 01:31:35.719]  And will be subject to additional monetary sanctions.
[01:31:36.359 --> 01:31:38.680]  Mr. Gilmour brought these consequences on himself.
[01:31:39.301 --> 01:31:44.003]  He left it the chance to file a lawsuit instead of exercising his own First Amendment rights to talk back.
[01:31:44.723 --> 01:31:57.729]  We can only hope that he will come to understand the wisdom of Justice Brandeis' words, that when it comes to fighting perceived falsehoods and fallacies, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.
[01:31:58.289 --> 01:31:59.830]  And with that, I'll turn it back to Alex.
[01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:00.350]  Thank you.
[01:32:02.873 --> 01:32:06.055]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:06.515 --> 01:32:07.836]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:32:08.316 --> 01:32:19.744]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:32:20.524 --> 01:32:29.451]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:32:29.872 --> 01:32:40.561]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:41.081 --> 01:32:43.403]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:32:43.723 --> 01:32:45.084]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:32:45.484 --> 01:32:55.092]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:55.192 --> 01:32:57.334]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:32:57.874 --> 01:33:02.778]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[01:33:06.341 --> 01:33:08.983]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.381 --> 01:33:19.224]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:19.604 --> 01:33:20.204]  Watch me!
[01:33:21.445 --> 01:33:22.086]  Watch me!
[01:33:23.446 --> 01:33:25.187]  I got it!
[01:33:25.287 --> 01:33:25.928]  Watch me!
[01:33:27.269 --> 01:33:27.769]  I got it!
[01:33:28.609 --> 01:33:29.050]  Hey!
[01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:32.652]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[01:33:33.712 --> 01:33:36.694]  I got something that tells me what it's all about!
[01:33:36.734 --> 01:33:41.056]  I got soul, and I'm super bad!
[01:33:44.943 --> 01:33:50.867]  Okay, so we're back live.
[01:33:50.907 --> 01:33:52.208]  Jake Lloyd's riding shotgun with us.
[01:33:52.268 --> 01:33:53.288]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:54.089 --> 01:34:00.834]  We'll get into the whole Whole Foods slash Amazon Foods Jeff Bezos command base invasion that happened just a few hours ago.
[01:34:01.474 --> 01:34:02.255]  You were there with me, but...
[01:34:03.086 --> 01:34:16.530]  You were silent during that last segment as I was reading off of the New York Observer and out of Zero Hedge and other publications, Jake, where they're saying the main job of the Democrats is to shut down Trump and Infowars.
[01:34:17.331 --> 01:34:23.393]  We have Project Veritas, internal videos of YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Google, New York Times, all saying the same thing.
[01:34:24.813 --> 01:34:26.053]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:34:26.314 --> 01:34:27.354]  I'm not that big.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:34.944]  But they see us and what we're saying, because they're insiders, as super accurate because we're on target.
[01:34:35.904 --> 01:34:37.625]  We actually study what they say and do.
[01:34:37.665 --> 01:34:38.746]  It's not that we're that big.
[01:34:39.686 --> 01:34:42.568]  It's that if people listen, it's over for them.
[01:34:43.088 --> 01:34:45.410]  Because the microcosm is the agencies.
[01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:50.733]  I used to think the agencies and the military would not be the problem, but weren't part of the solution.
[01:34:51.893 --> 01:34:55.095]  But then I realized they're already on the inside, so they actually know I'm telling the truth.
[01:34:55.375 --> 01:34:57.417]  That's the most awoke group right now.
[01:34:58.945 --> 01:35:01.471]  And so, that's why they're targeting us.
[01:35:01.792 --> 01:35:04.257]  So just speaking to that, because I want to make us the center of the story.
[01:35:04.538 --> 01:35:06.964]  But if we don't make a bigger deal out of this, they will win.
[01:35:06.984 --> 01:35:08.267]  They will destroy us.
[01:35:09.039 --> 01:35:11.280]  We're not just up here saying, oh, we're real big, they're after us.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.301]  Folks, we're the main target.
[01:35:13.361 --> 01:35:14.362]  Why do you think that is, Jake Lloyd?
[01:35:14.382 --> 01:35:15.743]  Well, part of it's a chilling effect.
[01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:24.268]  Part of it is that they want to take, they want to frame it as we're on the outside, we're on the fringe of the public voice.
[01:35:24.508 --> 01:35:27.330]  We're on the fringe and they want to say, oh, it's just Infowars, don't worry about them.
[01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:28.010]  Exactly.
[01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:32.252]  If you go there, globalism, world government, sovereignty will destroy you.
[01:35:32.292 --> 01:35:33.333]  When that's the reality.
[01:35:33.493 --> 01:35:35.054]  They want to make it where we're untouchable.
[01:35:35.174 --> 01:35:38.055]  Exactly, because we are an easy target in their eyes.
[01:35:38.115 --> 01:35:44.577]  Partially because a lot of people that should be on our side, a lot of people don't want to come to our defense.
[01:35:44.617 --> 01:35:50.820]  They don't want to defend our right to free speech because they've bought into the brainwashing that we're cuckoo, wacko.
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:51.100]  That's it.
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.140]  They want to play it safe.
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:56.122]  Or they think, so many times when Limbaugh was in trouble, people go, good, he'll be bigger.
[01:35:56.142 --> 01:35:57.722]  I remember talking to syndicators.
[01:35:57.742 --> 01:35:59.603]  They go, if Limbaugh has heart trouble,
[01:36:00.876 --> 01:36:04.357]  Or if Limbaugh, if this boycott works, you're going to get a lot bigger.
[01:36:04.377 --> 01:36:05.357]  And I went, no I'm not.
[01:36:05.377 --> 01:36:07.378]  They're going to shut all the talk radio down.
[01:36:07.858 --> 01:36:09.358]  I'm spending a half million dollars.
[01:36:09.378 --> 01:36:10.938]  Then I got Ted to spend another half million.
[01:36:10.958 --> 01:36:13.679]  We spent a total half million.
[01:36:13.699 --> 01:36:14.319]  I was a quarter million.
[01:36:14.339 --> 01:36:14.939]  He was a quarter million.
[01:36:15.299 --> 01:36:20.821]  I spent a half million on Limbaugh when these other syndicators were like getting off on the idea of his fall.
[01:36:21.061 --> 01:36:24.342]  They didn't have any sense that once they boycotted him, we were next.
[01:36:24.822 --> 01:36:27.762]  They have no... I don't hope Sean Hannity goes down.
[01:36:27.782 --> 01:36:28.983]  I don't hope that
[01:36:30.543 --> 01:36:31.824]  People like Tucker Carlson go down.
[01:36:32.084 --> 01:36:33.185]  I hope they get bigger and bigger!
[01:36:33.405 --> 01:36:34.425]  I have four children!
[01:36:34.445 --> 01:36:37.507]  And you have people... What is your problem, mainline conservatives?
[01:36:37.807 --> 01:36:39.128]  Celebrating we're under attack!
[01:36:39.148 --> 01:36:39.869]  You're idiots!
[01:36:40.449 --> 01:36:41.790]  Once they get us, you're next!
[01:36:42.236 --> 01:36:46.698]  I mean, people like Ben Shapiro have a serious, serious problem with coming at us like that.
[01:36:46.738 --> 01:36:50.120]  I mean, Ben Shapiro, you know, constantly makes jokes at our expense and everything.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:56.563]  But then Ben Shapiro goes out to Berkeley, or even some other, you know, slightly left-wing college, and they call him a Nazi.
[01:36:56.603 --> 01:36:57.163]  He's a Jew.
[01:36:57.643 --> 01:36:58.664]  He's an Orthodox Jew.
[01:36:58.744 --> 01:37:00.925]  And Ben Shapiro gets called a Nazi.
[01:37:01.325 --> 01:37:03.386]  By the way, I like Ben Shapiro.
[01:37:03.846 --> 01:37:04.406]  I don't really.
[01:37:04.607 --> 01:37:05.147]  I see his stuff.
[01:37:05.207 --> 01:37:05.587]  I agree with you.
[01:37:05.607 --> 01:37:06.207]  He's a smart guy.
[01:37:07.068 --> 01:37:07.668]  But I get it.
[01:37:07.748 --> 01:37:08.609]  We're under attack.
[01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:11.691]  It's an easy thing to differentiate himself and say, oh, I'm reasonable.
[01:37:12.091 --> 01:37:13.672]  We don't want to be in the middle of this thing.
[01:37:13.692 --> 01:37:14.432]  So I'm going to explain something.
[01:37:14.773 --> 01:37:17.915]  I'm not trying to win popularity contests like Ben Shapiro.
[01:37:19.253 --> 01:37:20.493]  Or other people.
[01:37:21.154 --> 01:37:22.734]  I'm here to get people thinking.
[01:37:22.794 --> 01:37:25.855]  We trailblazed the entire opening of the movement.
[01:37:25.875 --> 01:37:27.876]  And people like Matt Drudge got it.
[01:37:28.816 --> 01:37:32.077]  Matt Drudge helped us, we were already on the map, go to the next level.
[01:37:32.117 --> 01:37:33.598]  And I don't give credit for no reason.
[01:37:34.218 --> 01:37:36.219]  Matt Drudge went through a lot of heat for that, I know.
[01:37:36.599 --> 01:37:37.919]  But Matt knew we were telling the truth.
[01:37:37.959 --> 01:37:39.100]  He's reading the same news we're reading.
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:40.801]  He said we were a talk show host.
[01:37:40.941 --> 01:37:43.162]  He didn't want to be on the air anymore, so he knew we were covering the same stuff.
[01:37:43.182 --> 01:37:47.544]  I remember hearing Drudge, like, you know, 15 years ago about cloning and human-animal chimeras.
[01:37:47.865 --> 01:37:50.106]  Well, don't you know when Drudge hears me being attacked for that?
[01:37:50.626 --> 01:37:55.129]  You'll see Drudge put up a big article from the Japan Times or Reuters about human-animal chimeras.
[01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:56.669]  We're covering real stuff!
[01:37:56.910 --> 01:38:01.732]  Just because that shock's been Shapiro, and he doesn't want to talk about it because he wants to be kind of on the in crowd.
[01:38:02.072 --> 01:38:03.353]  You be part of the in crowd.
[01:38:03.473 --> 01:38:04.714]  I left high school a long time ago.
[01:38:05.290 --> 01:38:13.417]  Yeah, and the thing is, like you said, we don't need, it's not a popularity contest, we don't need to bring them down because they're attacking us, but all we're saying is stop.
[01:38:13.857 --> 01:38:23.345]  Stop the infighting for no reason, because Ben Shapiro, you can do your normal middle-of-the-road conservative thing all you want, that's fine, it brings people into the movement, all that different stuff.
[01:38:23.385 --> 01:38:26.047]  Ben Shapiro's brought a lot of college students into thinking.
[01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:28.510]  Yeah, he's great, he's very well-spoken, and it takes different folks.
[01:38:29.170 --> 01:38:29.951]  Take Candace Owens.
[01:38:30.392 --> 01:38:31.913]  Paul Watson says you gotta get her on.
[01:38:31.953 --> 01:38:32.774]  She's super talented.
[01:38:32.794 --> 01:38:33.936]  Have her on five or six times.
[01:38:34.416 --> 01:38:39.322]  She gets hired by that big group Trump's involved with about waking the colleges up.
[01:38:39.342 --> 01:38:39.823]  What's the name of it?
[01:38:39.843 --> 01:38:40.223]  Turning Point.
[01:38:40.383 --> 01:38:40.864]  Turning Point.
[01:38:41.464 --> 01:38:43.967]  I was on the plane flying back to Austin once with the head of Turning Point.
[01:38:44.708 --> 01:38:49.092]  And then, but now that she's on Fox News some and wherever we call her, oh, we're not cool enough.
[01:38:49.693 --> 01:38:52.095]  Hey, Candace, I was offered Fox News shows three times.
[01:38:52.115 --> 01:38:53.676]  It's not like we even need you on the show.
[01:38:53.716 --> 01:38:56.498]  We had you on to boost you because you're a smart big person.
[01:38:56.779 --> 01:38:59.381]  Having you on after the big story doesn't do anything for us.
[01:38:59.721 --> 01:39:02.103]  We push you because you are articulate and smart and cool.
[01:39:02.684 --> 01:39:03.104]  You understand?
[01:39:03.124 --> 01:39:06.047]  You're not safe going with the mainline Republicans.
[01:39:06.067 --> 01:39:08.129]  That's how they keep you on the reservation.
[01:39:08.389 --> 01:39:09.170]  I think Kanye West
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:15.924]  Yeah, Kanye West really does, and the thing is, a lot of people- The thing is, we're not trying to get accepted!
[01:39:16.445 --> 01:39:18.506]  We're trying to overturn the whole paradigm here!
[01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:33.337]  Yeah, and a lot of people are now using it as a- because they, um, certain conservative voices were like, oh, don't listen to Kanye West for your political opinions, and nobody said- nobody ever said that you should do that, because now he's going back- It's about his courage to say there's simply free speech!
[01:39:33.617 --> 01:39:38.020]  And even if- And what happened to us, where that's a big deal to have that courage to say I support the President!
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:45.942]  And even if he's still a liberal, because he said, my hero, Emma Gonzalez, he's still serving to normalize our type of politics in the mainstream.
[01:39:45.962 --> 01:39:47.703]  He's still a major cultural figure.
[01:39:47.723 --> 01:39:48.743]  He's standing up for free thought.
[01:39:49.203 --> 01:39:49.443]  Exactly.
[01:39:49.463 --> 01:39:50.804]  By the way, do we have the Jordan Peterson clip?
[01:39:53.565 --> 01:39:55.625]  I saw this clip, because I like Jordan Peterson.
[01:39:55.645 --> 01:39:59.846]  I saw a few of his things and, you know, the crazy debates he's in, where they make stuff up about him.
[01:39:59.886 --> 01:40:02.667]  He's this well-spoken professor and everything, and the left's really scared of him.
[01:40:02.687 --> 01:40:04.728]  So I watched a couple hours of him last night, this morning.
[01:40:06.226 --> 01:40:12.590]  And this is Carl Jung's psychology, but it's also just self-evident truth that little wimpy weirdos want to dominate and control.
[01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:15.892]  They want emasculated males so they don't have any competition.
[01:40:16.633 --> 01:40:23.017]  And I've always said this, the weird twisted betas I've found are the ones that get together and set up tyrannies like Hitler and others.
[01:40:23.618 --> 01:40:26.920]  And so you're never going to see virtue out of one of these people.
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:31.163]  And here is the video, part of the video where Peterson, what's the exact headline?
[01:40:31.183 --> 01:40:31.703]  I'm going from memory.
[01:40:31.723 --> 01:40:32.524]  I'm teleprompter free.
[01:40:32.544 --> 01:40:35.666]  It was, uh, why, why weak men can't be virtuous.
[01:40:35.706 --> 01:40:36.006]  Here it is.
[01:40:37.948 --> 01:40:43.314]  But if you only know how to behave, you're just a domesticated house cat, or a lap dog.
[01:40:43.754 --> 01:40:49.541]  You have to push beyond the persona, and that's what the integration of the shadow does from the Jungian perspective.
[01:40:49.581 --> 01:40:50.522]  It's like to pull that
[01:40:51.545 --> 01:41:06.589]  Monster that's been Edited out of you to pull that back in and to allow that to reveal itself within your within your Increasingly sophisticated way of being and then you're not just a persona.
[01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:14.230]  So if you want to push back on your persona Are you saying that you have to cultivate your dark your shadow is that yeah?
[01:41:14.290 --> 01:41:19.912]  Yeah, because the thing is you can't you can't escape from your persona unless you can say no
[01:41:21.461 --> 01:41:23.563]  Here's an example from popular culture.
[01:41:25.184 --> 01:41:29.088]  In the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter's obviously the hero of the story.
[01:41:29.708 --> 01:41:31.350]  He's touched by malevolence, right?
[01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:36.494]  The only reason he can stand up against evil is because there's some evil in him that he's incorporated, essentially.
[01:41:36.934 --> 01:41:38.035]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:41:38.356 --> 01:41:39.657]  The persona...
[01:41:41.889 --> 01:41:44.210]  If you're a persona, then you're an obedient citizen.
[01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:55.158]  But the problem with being an obedient citizen is that if the society tells you to march the Jews off to the death camp, for example, and you're obedient, then that's what you'll do.
[01:41:55.998 --> 01:42:01.462]  And it doesn't... it isn't like society is civilized, then all of a sudden you're performing some act of atrocity.
[01:42:01.482 --> 01:42:02.102]  Successive approximation.
[01:42:02.122 --> 01:42:02.963]  That isn't how it works.
[01:42:03.603 --> 01:42:03.964]  It's like...
[01:42:04.864 --> 01:42:09.286]  You're an obedient citizen and then you're asked to violate your conscience a little bit.
[01:42:09.566 --> 01:42:09.746]  Yeah.
[01:42:10.406 --> 01:42:14.228]  And you have to because you don't have anything other than that persona.
[01:42:14.248 --> 01:42:16.148]  Let's stop right there.
[01:42:16.949 --> 01:42:22.311]  And I think this interpretation of Carl Jung is, and I know he's doing it for the public, he's a smart guy, it's an oversimplification.
[01:42:23.171 --> 01:42:28.533]  Because, I wouldn't even call it the shadow, you've got conformity, but if conformity means evil, it's your light side.
[01:42:29.511 --> 01:42:31.292]  is saying you can't conform with this evil.
[01:42:31.852 --> 01:42:33.253]  You've got to go ahead and get in their face.
[01:42:33.273 --> 01:42:36.855]  But I agree, if you have a knowledge of evil, then you understand what's happening with evil.
[01:42:36.875 --> 01:42:40.017]  Some of the purest people are totally blind to it because they're so pure.
[01:42:40.477 --> 01:42:44.059]  Those of us that have kind of a wicked side, though it's a smaller side, can actually see into it.
[01:42:44.079 --> 01:42:44.940]  But I think that's what he's getting to.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.741]  It's a larger lecture.
[01:42:46.821 --> 01:42:49.082]  It's worth watching, and that's why they definitely are scared of him.
[01:42:49.102 --> 01:42:53.805]  All right, Jake Lloyd was with me today, InfoWars reporter, at the Jeff Bezos
[01:42:54.865 --> 01:43:00.287]  New Amazon foods Whole Foods is now Amazon's inorganic food is their new slogan.
[01:43:02.407 --> 01:43:04.288]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:43:04.328 --> 01:43:04.668]  Go ahead.
[01:43:05.568 --> 01:43:07.469]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:43:07.489 --> 01:43:17.812]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:43:17.992 --> 01:43:21.353]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:43:21.893 --> 01:43:24.256]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:43:24.456 --> 01:43:26.598]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:43:26.698 --> 01:43:27.098]  Thank you.
[01:43:27.759 --> 01:43:30.241]  I used the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:43:30.261 --> 01:43:34.025]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:43:34.586 --> 01:43:37.548]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the Infowars Life products.
[01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:38.589]  They are quality.
[01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:40.171]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:43:40.651 --> 01:43:43.354]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:43:43.554 --> 01:43:44.055]  Absolutely.
[01:43:44.595 --> 01:43:57.496]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:44:03.354 --> 01:44:07.238]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I know to go out and check the top scientists and see what they say.
[01:44:08.058 --> 01:44:22.751]  And they have talked about for decades that a lot of the mental disorders, a lot of the behavioral disorders, a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut from the diets and vaccines that trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach.
[01:44:24.112 --> 01:44:27.915]  That then create major toxicity in the gut, causing toxicity in the brain.
[01:44:27.955 --> 01:44:29.956]  Here's a big BBC report today.
[01:44:30.076 --> 01:44:32.258]  How bacteria are changing your mood.
[01:44:32.278 --> 01:44:34.139]  If you have the wrong ones, you're depressed.
[01:44:34.299 --> 01:44:36.200]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's been sold out for months.
[01:44:36.921 --> 01:44:38.041]  MycoZX is back.

[01:44:40.623 --> 01:44:52.397]  It goes in and knocks out the walls in your intestines where these things colonize it and put a slime wall in, but the nutrients go through, they get what they want first, they colonize you, then they secrete toxins in you that cause depression.
[01:44:52.417 --> 01:44:55.080]  They can even secrete toxins when they want more sugar.
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:55.841]  This is well known.
[01:44:55.981 --> 01:44:57.823]  Nukem with MycoZX.

[01:46:11.017 --> 01:46:19.104]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:46:19.424 --> 01:46:24.126]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:46:45.293 --> 01:46:49.656]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:47:32.637 --> 01:47:34.098]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:34.918 --> 01:47:37.960]  And we'll be back tomorrow with the weekday transmission 11 a.m.
[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:38.661]  to 3 p.m.
[01:47:38.681 --> 01:47:41.943]  and other broadcasts at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:47:43.407 --> 01:47:45.569]  We got the free podcast, all the rest of it.
[01:47:45.809 --> 01:47:46.810]  Jake Lloyd here with me.
[01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:58.339]  How would you just briefly, Jake Lloyd, how would you describe what we witnessed at the Jeff Bezos Whole Foods, Amazon Foods headquarters now here in Austin, Texas?
[01:47:58.979 --> 01:48:02.023]  Well, briefly, we went in just to look at the supplements that they're selling.
[01:48:02.043 --> 01:48:06.127]  You know, they're very, very similar to the ones that we sell, similar, just private labeled.
[01:48:06.448 --> 01:48:10.913]  We go in there and we have a few people, a few brainwashed people snickering at us, a lot of fans.
[01:48:11.233 --> 01:48:15.178]  And then we have some, uh, rent-a-cops that come over and they're a little bit, uh, one of them's okay.
[01:48:15.338 --> 01:48:15.878]  One of them's nice.
[01:48:16.279 --> 01:48:18.541]  Another one of them kind of gets on a power trip a little bit.
[01:48:19.282 --> 01:48:21.464]  After we've already left and are at the edge of the property.
[01:48:21.544 --> 01:48:25.848]  Yeah, we're stepping onto the sidewalk and everything and he's like, okay, listen up, listen up.
[01:48:25.889 --> 01:48:27.050]  I'm going to give you one last warning.
[01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:37.940]  So we step off on the sidewalk and he keeps wanting to give attitude and then Alex there in the video is just trying to figure out if they'll try to call the cops if we go get our cars because we're parked in the parking garage and they won't give an answer.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.842]  They just keep saying step off, step off, step off.
[01:48:39.882 --> 01:48:44.146]  So it was, uh, you know, it was interesting.
[01:48:46.155 --> 01:48:54.410]  And again, it's about Jeff Bezos, who makes his money off taxpayers and is tax exempt in the $1.50 per package, making $12 billion last Monday.
[01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:55.673]  Let's go ahead and roll this report.
[01:48:57.273 --> 01:49:02.477]  Jeff Bezos is a criminal who is anti-free market and anti-America!
[01:49:03.218 --> 01:49:07.081]  And we came out here nicely to cover it, and he had one of his goons get in our face!
[01:49:07.601 --> 01:49:20.691]  So now, I'm coming down here, I swear to God, at least five times in the next month, to bullhorn this facility, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, Unorganic Food Headquarters!
[01:49:25.947 --> 01:49:26.928]  We're here at Whole Paycheck.
[01:49:27.508 --> 01:49:30.651]  Or now, not at Whole Foods, but Amazon Foods.
[01:49:31.592 --> 01:49:33.314]  So we're here at... Hey, how's it going, guys?
[01:49:33.694 --> 01:49:34.815]  How's it going, man?
[01:49:35.696 --> 01:49:36.617]  Come on over here and talk to us.
[01:49:36.917 --> 01:49:37.778]  Other folks are scared of us.
[01:49:37.798 --> 01:49:38.118]  How you doing?
[01:49:38.318 --> 01:49:39.139]  Pretty good, pretty good.
[01:49:39.219 --> 01:49:40.320]  We're here at Whole Paycheck.
[01:49:40.841 --> 01:49:41.701]  Oh, shit.
[01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:43.343]  Hey, you know Jeff Bezos owns this now, right?
[01:49:43.623 --> 01:49:44.344]  Nah, nah.
[01:49:44.364 --> 01:49:45.945]  The guy that owns Amazon, the richest guy in the world?
[01:49:46.205 --> 01:49:46.486]  Uh-huh.
[01:49:47.266 --> 01:49:48.747]  He made 12 billion bucks last week.
[01:49:49.027 --> 01:49:49.667]  That's insane.
[01:49:49.687 --> 01:49:50.628]  You know how he makes it?
[01:49:51.008 --> 01:49:51.388]  No.
[01:49:51.408 --> 01:49:53.789]  He's got monopolies and he's tax-exempt offshore.
[01:49:54.349 --> 01:49:58.030]  And he gets $1.50 on every package shipped by the post office.
[01:49:58.070 --> 01:50:00.111]  And his package, he gets $1.50 from taxpayers.
[01:50:00.852 --> 01:50:01.172]  Damn.
[01:50:01.192 --> 01:50:02.232]  Is that pretty amazing?
[01:50:02.572 --> 01:50:03.273]  Yeah, that's pretty amazing.
[01:50:03.293 --> 01:50:03.733]  All right, guys.
[01:50:03.753 --> 01:50:04.533]  I was just saying hi.
[01:50:04.553 --> 01:50:05.413]  You guys wanted to say hi.
[01:50:05.533 --> 01:50:06.554]  All right.
[01:50:10.215 --> 01:50:10.776]  Oh, pardon me, man.
[01:50:11.016 --> 01:50:12.336]  We're just here checking out Amazon.
[01:50:12.356 --> 01:50:14.257]  This is the new Amazon Shopping Center.
[01:50:19.517 --> 01:50:20.981]  And as you can see, nobody said anything to us yet.
[01:50:21.001 --> 01:50:21.542]  I thought they would.
[01:50:22.765 --> 01:50:23.567]  These folks want to talk to us.
[01:50:23.627 --> 01:50:25.170]  Come on over.
[01:50:25.190 --> 01:50:27.676]  Come on over.
[01:50:27.736 --> 01:50:28.197]  It's alright.
[01:50:30.283 --> 01:50:32.745]  We're here visiting the Amazon Shopping Center.
[01:50:32.785 --> 01:50:33.606]  You can do it, see?
[01:50:33.646 --> 01:50:34.746]  Leftists can never talk.
[01:50:35.227 --> 01:50:35.927]  They're unable to.
[01:50:35.987 --> 01:50:36.568]  Hey, how's it going, man?
[01:50:36.588 --> 01:50:36.828]  We're good.
[01:50:36.848 --> 01:50:37.909]  We've got a couple questions.
[01:50:37.949 --> 01:50:39.730]  Hi, I'm Officer Barron with Tri-State Security.
[01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:40.811]  Alex Jones, nice to meet you.
[01:50:40.831 --> 01:50:41.692]  Nice to meet you.
[01:50:41.712 --> 01:50:44.213]  So, the store wants us to find out what you guys are filming for?
[01:50:44.293 --> 01:50:44.594]  You bet.
[01:50:44.794 --> 01:50:47.075]  Well, we're not filming, we're just shooting live video.
[01:50:47.176 --> 01:50:49.517]  Okay, well, what is your intention for trying to do this?
[01:50:49.557 --> 01:50:54.081]  Sure, our intention is, kind of like you see Michael Moore goes in and shows things and talks to people.
[01:50:54.921 --> 01:50:56.842]  Jeff Bezos has now bought Whole Foods.
[01:50:57.583 --> 01:51:05.649]  And so we wanted to come show people now that the world headquarters of Whole Foods is now the world headquarters of Amazon Foods.
[01:51:06.189 --> 01:51:11.713]  And that we wanted to then see if people knew about Jeff Bezos and just about the fact that he's a big globalist.
[01:51:12.313 --> 01:51:14.255]  He pushes anti-capitalist agenda.
[01:51:15.015 --> 01:51:18.696]  Publicly, but then he's the richest man in the world who made $12 million in one day last week.
[01:51:19.256 --> 01:51:20.517]  So, we're just simply here.
[01:51:20.537 --> 01:51:25.478]  I've been a customer here since it was the old one over there 10 years ago.
[01:51:25.498 --> 01:51:27.319]  I was a customer there for about 10 years.
[01:51:27.339 --> 01:51:28.920]  It's like I was a book people.
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.220]  So, I've been here many times.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:36.162]  I'm just here to walk around and actually show people in the live ecosystem here at Amazon Foods.
[01:51:37.225 --> 01:51:43.594]  Well, our management here is actually going to ask if you guys can quit recording because they don't feel comfortable with it.
[01:51:43.614 --> 01:51:45.236]  They don't have any knowledge of it.
[01:51:45.276 --> 01:51:45.596]  Sure, sure.
[01:51:45.636 --> 01:51:46.217]  That's reasonable.
[01:51:46.257 --> 01:51:47.479]  Can I talk to the management?
[01:51:47.519 --> 01:51:52.125]  I'm going to hold them up and see if they're willing to talk to you, but I'm just going to pass it out.
[01:51:52.305 --> 01:51:53.566]  No, no, no.
[01:51:53.586 --> 01:51:54.406]  We're happy to go.
[01:51:54.466 --> 01:51:56.847]  I was going to do some shopping later, but we're happy to go.
[01:51:56.867 --> 01:51:57.367]  That's reasonable.
[01:51:57.387 --> 01:51:58.388]  This is private property.
[01:51:58.668 --> 01:52:00.189]  This is Bezos' private property.
[01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:01.609]  He doesn't respect ours.
[01:52:01.649 --> 01:52:03.350]  He lobbies to end small family homes.
[01:52:03.810 --> 01:52:06.332]  He wants 250-square-foot coffin apartments.
[01:52:06.692 --> 01:52:07.892]  USNA called for that last week.
[01:52:08.052 --> 01:52:11.014]  He doesn't want you to have any money, but he made $12 billion in one day last week.
[01:52:11.194 --> 01:52:12.694]  But I agree with his property rights.
[01:52:12.734 --> 01:52:17.257]  And I agree with this security officer's point that this is private property, and that they've asked us to stop filming.
[01:52:17.277 --> 01:52:20.078]  So what we're going to do is, we're going to go wait outside on the property line.
[01:52:20.638 --> 01:52:21.979]  And if you can see him, he'll talk to us sir.
[01:52:22.019 --> 01:52:23.400]  We'd love to talk to him.
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:27.122]  Thank you so much for honoring the private property.
[01:52:27.542 --> 01:52:27.843]  Thank you.
[01:52:27.903 --> 01:52:28.243]  Thank you.
[01:52:28.263 --> 01:52:29.504]  What's going on outside?
[01:52:29.524 --> 01:52:30.084]  So there you go.
[01:52:30.104 --> 01:52:31.585]  We are honoring private property right now.
[01:52:31.665 --> 01:52:33.966]  And he made those lobbies viciously to me.
[01:52:34.006 --> 01:52:36.088]  Oh, let me call you back.
[01:52:36.108 --> 01:52:36.848]  I'll pause right there.
[01:52:36.868 --> 01:52:37.849]  And so we're outside.
[01:52:37.869 --> 01:52:39.650]  We're on the corner of the property.
[01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:42.311]  And a guy charges up and says, I'm going to call the cops on you.
[01:52:42.672 --> 01:52:43.672]  And I'm like, that's fine.
[01:52:44.093 --> 01:52:45.273]  We're about to turn the cameras off.
[01:52:45.974 --> 01:52:46.914]  Can I just get my car?
[01:52:46.994 --> 01:52:47.535]  He wouldn't answer.
[01:52:48.095 --> 01:52:49.676]  Yeah, I mean, we were wrapping up the video.
[01:52:49.716 --> 01:52:53.019]  We were about to wrap up the transmission, get off the phones and everything.
[01:52:53.079 --> 01:52:54.140]  And no one's around us.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:56.862]  We're on the, like, there's like a park, that little park there.
[01:52:56.902 --> 01:52:57.742]  We're at the very corner.
[01:52:57.762 --> 01:52:58.543]  No one's around us.
[01:52:58.883 --> 01:52:59.284]  It's us.
[01:52:59.844 --> 01:53:00.845]  It's just us standing there.
[01:53:01.025 --> 01:53:02.746]  And there's two girls sitting on a bench.
[01:53:02.806 --> 01:53:03.507]  They weren't even there.
[01:53:03.527 --> 01:53:06.349]  It's not like they were eating Whole Foods products or anything.
[01:53:06.369 --> 01:53:07.110]  They were just sitting there.
[01:53:07.170 --> 01:53:08.150]  So they're just hanging out.
[01:53:08.451 --> 01:53:11.373]  They're loitering on, you know, I guess that's a Whole Foods property still.
[01:53:11.813 --> 01:53:14.354]  And then we say, well, we're going to step off on the sidewalk here now.
[01:53:14.674 --> 01:53:15.814]  They're like, well, it's a private prop.
[01:53:16.014 --> 01:53:17.074]  That's a private sidewalk.
[01:53:17.414 --> 01:53:19.655]  But then they keep telling us to hop down there or they're going to call the police.
[01:53:20.135 --> 01:53:22.115]  So it doesn't even that story doesn't line up.
[01:53:22.135 --> 01:53:23.415]  Well, it just shows the jerk.
[01:53:23.956 --> 01:53:24.776]  The first guy was nice.
[01:53:25.096 --> 01:53:25.256]  Yeah.
[01:53:25.896 --> 01:53:26.936]  And the other guy doing his job.
[01:53:27.336 --> 01:53:30.217]  Point is, it's about Jeff Bezos, Bezos, whatever you want to say.
[01:53:30.617 --> 01:53:31.557]  I'm not going to get the rest of it.
[01:53:31.577 --> 01:53:32.677]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:53:32.697 --> 01:53:34.458]  But he gets taxpayer money.
[01:53:34.478 --> 01:53:36.038]  He can make 12 billion a day.
[01:53:36.098 --> 01:53:36.598]  That's fine.
[01:53:37.118 --> 01:53:38.059]  We're not against free market.
[01:53:38.079 --> 01:53:39.559]  But then he funds Black Lives Matter.
[01:53:40.666 --> 01:53:42.227]  He funds Antifa.
[01:53:42.707 --> 01:53:43.947]  He funds the Socialists.
[01:53:45.027 --> 01:53:46.368]  He works with Soros.
[01:53:47.168 --> 01:53:49.649]  He funds the Washington Post, trying to stop our movement.
[01:53:50.469 --> 01:54:03.013]  And the big thing is, I showed my wife this morning, she was asking me about this before I went out there, if you go to Washington Post and type in Alex Jones, or just into a search engine, Alex Jones, WashingtonPost.com, snake oil.
[01:54:03.033 --> 01:54:05.214]  There's all these articles saying I'm a snake oil salesman.
[01:54:06.212 --> 01:54:12.357]  I sell multivitamins, I sell amino acids, I sell like the highest quality stuff.
[01:54:12.878 --> 01:54:17.081]  Bezos can make millions a year, but I can't make millions to fund her operation.
[01:54:17.161 --> 01:54:17.562]  I'm bad.
[01:54:17.982 --> 01:54:22.706]  And the left comes, like Comedy Central confronted me in DC, and ABC, and CBS, and NBC.
[01:54:22.986 --> 01:54:24.547]  You sell supplements, you're a con man!
[01:54:25.088 --> 01:54:27.069]  And I go, I sell the very same ones, but even better.
[01:54:27.089 --> 01:54:27.870]  And they go, shut up!
[01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:28.691]  We're not talking about it.
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:34.542]  Right, and Jeff Bezos, like you said, his money comes from these government-subsidized monopolies.
[01:54:34.882 --> 01:54:43.686]  The government funds him to take over an industry, to take over these different aspects of the economy, and then with that money he goes, like you said, and funds Black Lives Matter.
[01:54:43.706 --> 01:54:49.388]  So it's the government using this opportunity to fund these anti-liberty movements.
[01:54:49.528 --> 01:54:52.249]  And then just like the Clinton Foundation, the money goes back to the Democrats.
[01:54:52.569 --> 01:54:52.949]  Exactly.
[01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:56.110]  That's why they say Trump is, quote, obsessed with Amazon.
[01:54:56.410 --> 01:54:57.750]  Yeah, because it's the shadow government.
[01:54:58.150 --> 01:55:02.211]  You don't just think he really made, no one's ever made $14 billion in six months.
[01:55:02.672 --> 01:55:03.552]  He made it in one day.
[01:55:03.592 --> 01:55:05.892]  The guy's going to be worth like $500 billion in a few months.
[01:55:06.813 --> 01:55:07.933]  He's taking everything over.
[01:55:08.773 --> 01:55:10.513]  He's taking over all the public housing.
[01:55:10.533 --> 01:55:12.774]  He's just taking everything over.
[01:55:12.834 --> 01:55:14.534]  But he's liberal and pays no taxes.
[01:55:14.735 --> 01:55:16.415]  And the left's like, he pays no tax.
[01:55:16.855 --> 01:55:18.455]  He is worth $140 billion.
[01:55:18.495 --> 01:55:20.556]  We worship Bezos, Bezos, Bezos.
[01:55:20.936 --> 01:55:24.460]  And he, isn't Amazon, aren't they making the cloud for the Pentagon now?
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.162]  Yes, CIA, everything.
[01:55:26.402 --> 01:55:37.514]  And that doesn't set off any alarm bells in anybody's brain, the fact that the government subsidizes this guy's entire corporate life, and then he has these contracts with the government to store all of your data that the government is in.
[01:55:37.554 --> 01:55:41.258]  But it's even in the news that the staff say they're going away from organic, they're getting crap now.
[01:55:42.699 --> 01:55:43.479]  Well, they're moving away.
[01:55:43.519 --> 01:55:46.800]  They used to bring in different brands and sell them there.
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.081]  Now they're trying to bring it all in and only sell Whole Foods brand.
[01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:52.961]  Their 365 or whatever it's called.
[01:55:53.201 --> 01:55:56.882]  They're trying to only sell Whole Foods brands so that all of the money comes back.
[01:55:56.902 --> 01:55:57.602]  The left will buy it.
[01:55:57.622 --> 01:55:58.842]  Let me tell you something.
[01:55:58.882 --> 01:56:02.623]  They'd eat radioactive sludge if Bezos said it.
[01:56:02.643 --> 01:56:03.203]  I'm telling you, man.
[01:56:03.223 --> 01:56:04.023]  He'd snap his finger.
[01:56:04.063 --> 01:56:04.983]  You're racist if you don't.
[01:56:05.223 --> 01:56:07.544]  They'd run to Chernobyl and just start gobbling radiation.
[01:56:09.556 --> 01:56:11.599]  If you told a leopard to throw their kid off a cliff, they'd do it.
[01:56:11.619 --> 01:56:13.382]  They just want to virtue-signal.
[01:56:13.703 --> 01:56:15.105]  Well, it's purely virtue-signaling.
[01:56:15.125 --> 01:56:15.907]  The food's no good anymore.
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.521]  It's all about, it's just about the cult.
[01:56:20.561 --> 01:56:26.723]  It's about the cult of being trendy, the cult of just... Oh, they've got all these magazines about austerity and how to be poor and how sexy it is.
[01:56:26.783 --> 01:56:27.503]  That's Bezos.
[01:56:27.523 --> 01:56:35.446]  Well, we'll be back tomorrow with David Knight in the morning, 8am, myself at 11am, and then we've got Owen Troyer and others at 3 o'clock central.
[01:56:35.866 --> 01:56:40.348]  We sell high quality supplements that are game changers, air filtration, water filtration.
[01:56:40.808 --> 01:56:42.509]  We sell a four-stage HIPAA filter.
[01:56:43.089 --> 01:56:46.974]  For $200, that's at regular price, when the leading competitor is $400, $500, $600.
[01:56:47.294 --> 01:56:49.036]  And ours is just as good.
[01:56:49.076 --> 01:56:54.082]  We've got the Whole Body Support Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with a 95% curcumin in rating.
[01:56:54.542 --> 01:56:57.806]  Stuff sold at Whole Foods on average is a 3% curcumin in rating.

[01:57:32.658 --> 01:57:34.819]  Yeah, so I can keep all the counterfeits off and all the fake stuff.
[01:57:34.839 --> 01:57:35.379]  I don't promote it.

[01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:31.736]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
