[00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:15.155]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:54.412]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday.
[00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.553]  Global transmission.
[00:00:56.573 --> 00:01:00.975]  Hard to believe it's already the 10th day of August 2018.
[00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:03.996]  We're going to be here for the next four hours on 8, 10, 18.
[00:01:06.757 --> 00:01:09.198]  Okay, let's lay out what's happening right now.
[00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:18.981]  China is the most bloodthirsty, murderous, authoritarian regime in planetary history, killing conservatively over 100 million of their own people.
[00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:25.107]  The Rockefellers and others by the 60s began a program to build them up against the U.S.
[00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:26.370]  to actually help put them in power in 1949.
[00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.592]  That is a historical fact.
[00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:35.368]  They are now in control of Google to a great extent, in complete control of Apple.
[00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:36.968]  Apple is now state-run.
[00:01:37.028 --> 00:01:42.291]  They are implementing a purge, not just against Infowars, but against everyone else.
[00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:50.494]  In fact, it's all over the news that their next target is Steven Crowder, and they list a bunch of other mainline popular conservatives, particularly with young people.
[00:01:52.235 --> 00:02:00.038]  Notice that three days ago, Media Matters, run by George Soros, said our next target is the climate deniers.
[00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.190]  People that don't want to pay a global carbon tax and don't think that man-made global warming is real.
[00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:07.091]  And the evidence points towards that.
[00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:09.192]  They are now being perched.
[00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:21.576]  So, I told everybody, they've been demonizing me for a year and a half, so that everyone, when they went after my free speech, would think, oh, that's just Alex Jones's.
[00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:23.957]  And, you know, there's this evil straw man that's Alex Jones.
[00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.160]  And so, it's okay for him to lose his free speech.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.581]  But now you've got Congressman Murphy and others saying, no, he's the tip of the rotting iceberg.
[00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.982]  We want them all off now, because they're really panicked.
[00:02:37.322 --> 00:02:38.242]  The numbers are coming in.
[00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:42.063]  They're going to lose the midterms currently, even with all their election fraud.
[00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:47.465]  Now, that said, China fired six shots at U.S.
[00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.965]  Navy in the South China Sea today.
[00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:50.946]  This is China.
[00:02:51.126 --> 00:02:52.026]  Leave immediately.
[00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.501]  Now that's in the Express News, it's in the BBC.
[00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:56.942]  Almost no coverage of this here.
[00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:58.963]  They are now in the Main Strait.
[00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:09.672]  The South China Sea, with these little islands they've built, with these dredges, with missile emplacements and artillery, threatening everyone, saying, we are in control.
[00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:12.274]  They're even saying they control part of the Philippines.
[00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:15.997]  So, China is threatening to invade Taiwan.
[00:03:16.037 --> 00:03:18.098]  They're telling U.S.
[00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:21.241]  airlines, you better not say Taiwan on your
[00:03:22.546 --> 00:03:28.470]  Destination, or you can't come into the airspace, and we've got fighter planes in the air.
[00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:48.642]  So China is running around, being extremely out of control and aggressive, but they're getting their butt kicked by Trump because they've got a $300 billion intellectual property theft that's conservative $300 billion, $500 conservative billion in trade deficit with us each year, and Trump said, you're going to give us something back, just something.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.301]  At least you're going to use some lubrication.
[00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:52.622]  And they said no.
[00:03:54.664 --> 00:04:04.232]  So, six months after the tariffs began, China is now starting to back off and starting to remove some of the counter tariffs they put in.
[00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:05.754]  They're like, okay, okay.
[00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.196]  Trump's like, yeah, you're gonna give us a couple hundred billion.
[00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:10.957]  You're going to give us SOMETHING!
[00:04:10.977 --> 00:04:16.262]  I understand out in San Francisco and liberal land, pissing on America is a religion.
[00:04:16.743 --> 00:04:22.548]  Mounting our head on the wall is all these weird leftists that got brainwashed in college that hating flower country is their religion.
[00:04:22.748 --> 00:04:23.589]  It literally is.
[00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.033]  But that religion is destroying the country that makes us successful.
[00:04:28.814 --> 00:04:30.115]  And you're doing it for China?
[00:04:32.352 --> 00:04:39.934]  You talk back to the police in China, the thing they do is cut your testicles off and then slit the artery right on the front of your thigh and they let you bleed out on the ground.
[00:04:41.294 --> 00:04:43.315]  There's dead bodies just rotting here and there.
[00:04:43.335 --> 00:04:44.595]  No one takes care of old people.
[00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:48.396]  It's hell on earth in many areas.
[00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:49.537]  But you don't care.
[00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:53.758]  You want to bring down America and have your way with it.
[00:04:53.778 --> 00:04:54.358]  Does it matter?
[00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:56.998]  Turkey's imploding right now facing a U.S.
[00:04:57.058 --> 00:04:58.779]  president that actually is using our power.
[00:05:01.383 --> 00:05:05.065]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[00:05:05.226 --> 00:05:10.249]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.610]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.351]  It is absolutely free.
[00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:18.554]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWar today.
[00:05:18.795 --> 00:05:22.677]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:26.660]  It's the InfoWars official app taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.003]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:05:34.744 --> 00:05:35.744]  Hey, have you heard?
[00:05:36.224 --> 00:05:38.285]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:39.665]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[00:05:39.825 --> 00:05:40.885]  They're all censoring us.
[00:05:41.246 --> 00:05:47.147]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:50.468]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[00:06:08.592 --> 00:06:11.995]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:55.197]  The circle is now complete.
[00:06:56.037 --> 00:06:58.078]  When I left you, I was but a learner.
[00:06:58.178 --> 00:06:59.999]  Now I am the master.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.441]  Only a master of evil, Darth.
[00:07:05.943 --> 00:07:07.824]  Your powers are weak, old man.
[00:07:07.864 --> 00:07:09.945]  You can't win, Darth.
[00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:15.268]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[00:07:29.313 --> 00:07:30.234]  No!
[00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:50.192]  We are number one trending app in news.
[00:07:50.452 --> 00:07:51.293]  Number one
[00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:53.272]  Trending.
[00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:55.513]  Click on that for a larger image, please.
[00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.315]  Number one trending.
[00:07:58.775 --> 00:08:01.496]  Guess what we are total out of thousands of news apps?
[00:08:02.277 --> 00:08:10.701]  We are number three total in the world surpassing CNN and Fox News.
[00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:15.067]  That was a couple days ago.
[00:08:15.107 --> 00:08:23.152]  Now we're number one in the news apps and climbing towards number one worldwide for all apps at current growth rates by next week.
[00:08:24.654 --> 00:08:28.056]  Up against apps that have been there for years and promoted on these platforms.
[00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:29.917]  They are hollow frauds.
[00:08:30.818 --> 00:08:34.440]  We now have a bigger news app, the New York Times and CNN combined.
[00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:40.965]  And they're both lobbying as hard as they can to have those apps destroyed.
[00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:42.839]  What will that do?
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:53.347]  Oh, and don't worry, Tim Cook, who's moved to China and now brought the Chinese government in to run the iCloud and all your iKeys, all your code keys, that's on record.
[00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:54.768]  That's why they really want me off air.
[00:08:55.809 --> 00:08:57.450]  He says, I'm being monitored.
[00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:05.456]  Oh my goodness, you're monitoring the app that is my streams and my internet and our articles.
[00:09:07.762 --> 00:09:13.085]  That adults choose to go download and that we paid to have put in your store.
[00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:15.366]  So we can give it away for free.
[00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:22.589]  And we're dominating all the other free apps of the New York Times and CNN and you don't know what to do.
[00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.092]  By the way, there's more disinfo out there from CNET News and all of them.
[00:09:28.892 --> 00:09:29.553]  I noticed that
[00:09:30.678 --> 00:09:40.264]  CNN, the web cops, the racketeers that spend all their time trying to get everybody deplatformed and to shut down conservative, nationalist, pro-Trump speech ahead of the midterms.
[00:09:41.484 --> 00:09:44.786]  I noticed yesterday they were doing reports on things out of context.
[00:09:44.926 --> 00:09:50.910]  I said out about David Hogg and about Parkland and about other events and I just said delete that stuff.
[00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:56.353]  It's not even, they're twisting what I said, but just just to take the super high road, delete it.
[00:09:57.878 --> 00:10:03.123]  That turns into Twitter finally took action and took down the evil tweets of Alex Jones.
[00:10:03.744 --> 00:10:10.030]  David Hogg was wearing a literal armband and posing for it saluting
[00:10:11.547 --> 00:10:20.930]  With his fist up on the air calling for gun confiscation, and people were calling that Nazi, and I said, well, it sure looks like that, but it doesn't matter.
[00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.870]  The left calls people Nazis all the time.
[00:10:24.551 --> 00:10:38.734]  And that's when YouTube gave me one of the false strikes back in February, was for talking about him, saying, you can't talk about the victim David Hogg, even though he's a public figure, calling me a con man and a piece of garbage.
[00:10:38.915 --> 00:10:40.015]  I didn't call him that.
[00:10:40.962 --> 00:10:42.343]  In fact, show my tweets, David Hogg.
[00:10:42.603 --> 00:10:44.044]  I sent him respectful tweets.
[00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:48.207]  And I said, I'd like you to come on the show since you're challenging me to a debate.
[00:10:48.868 --> 00:10:50.809]  And then he backed out of the debate.
[00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:58.914]  So, they are currently trying to
[00:11:03.004 --> 00:11:19.829]  Take me off of Twitter, as everyone knows, it's one of the big national news stories, and they're currently trying to get us delisted off of iTunes app and off of the Android, where you go with a contract, you pay for it, and then all it is is a hub for people on their devices.
[00:11:20.169 --> 00:11:30.392]  Now you talk about monopoly practices by Android and by Apple, if they try to say then, you can't have an app on their platform, that is antitrust 101.
[00:11:33.968 --> 00:11:39.051]  And they're trying to figure out how do they get around to that?
[00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:40.372]  How do they get that done?
[00:11:40.392 --> 00:11:51.319]  Don't worry, we're monitoring his app, just like you monitor the poor Chinese people and you report on them being Falun Gong or Christians and they get taken and their organs harvested after they work in slave labor for a couple years.
[00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:58.303]  And some rich westerner, you know, like Steve Jobs, needs a liver and we all know what happens.
[00:12:00.424 --> 00:12:04.928]  Remember, Steve Jobs said he wouldn't let his own kids play with an iPad when they first came out, because it brain damages them.
[00:12:05.148 --> 00:12:05.708]  That's confirmed.
[00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:20.781]  But they'll sit up there all high and mighty with their slave factories, some of the worst in the world, under Foxconn, under Apple contract, with suicide nets and forced abortion and one-child policies and forced drugging, and that's all cute and funny, isn't it?
[00:12:22.369 --> 00:12:24.529]  Because Apple is Chinese Communist run.
[00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:26.630]  That's mainstream news.
[00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.930]  There's more news about it today.
[00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:32.431]  And how Google is building a total censorship system in America and in China.
[00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:37.072]  They're testing their system here on Americans.
[00:12:42.153 --> 00:12:45.854]  New listeners won't believe they have mobile suicide trucks in every town.
[00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.112]  New Lizards won't believe they have suicide nets around Foxconn.
[00:12:50.492 --> 00:13:01.020]  So don't just show the photos, just type into the web, click web and type in suicide nets, Foxconn, Apple factories, and then type in mobile execution vans, China.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.702]  You'll get AP, Reuters, CBS News.
[00:13:04.142 --> 00:13:10.246]  But from 10 years ago, they will not report it now because that's a big, big no-no.
[00:13:11.787 --> 00:13:15.730]  So I have requested, and I'm going to read this statement when we come back from break,
[00:13:18.601 --> 00:13:20.061]  I'm going to read it when we come back from break.
[00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:40.806]  My statement calling for hearings in Congress and I demand respectfully that I be able to be at those hearings and be able to lay out what's really happened because I've been demonized and I've been lied about and they've done all these horrible things that I need to be able to sit there as an American as my birthright and do that.
[00:13:47.162 --> 00:13:49.124]  Let me tell you what's coming up after I get into that.
[00:13:51.586 --> 00:13:54.408]  China has fired six warnings at U.S.
[00:13:54.468 --> 00:14:01.173]  Navy ships in the South China Sea saying, this is China, leave immediately, when for thousands of years no one has said that they own the South China Sea.
[00:14:01.453 --> 00:14:02.654]  This is very, very aggressive.
[00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:08.239]  They're doing that because Trump is winning the trade war against them, but they were already expanding and out of control.
[00:14:08.779 --> 00:14:14.504]  Turkish lira plunges 20% versus dollar after Trump authorizes doubling metals tariffs on Turkey.
[00:14:17.082 --> 00:14:23.288]  Their dictator said, it doesn't matter, they have their dollars, we have our God.
[00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.734]  China has reversed itself on oil tariffs after they realized it would hurt them more than it would hurt us.
[00:14:30.214 --> 00:14:37.481]  All these countries have one-sided tariffs on us, and all Trump is doing is saying, we're not even going to meet you at the level of your tariffs on us.
[00:14:38.697 --> 00:14:39.778]  He said $50 billion.
[00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:40.559]  They said no.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.720]  He said $100 billion.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.241]  They said no.
[00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:43.422]  He said $200 billion.
[00:14:43.442 --> 00:14:43.923]  They said no.
[00:14:44.223 --> 00:14:45.044]  He said $300 billion.
[00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:45.545]  They said no.
[00:14:45.945 --> 00:14:47.026]  He said $350 billion.
[00:14:47.267 --> 00:14:48.829]  They said, whoa, okay, yeah.
[00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:49.469]  See?
[00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:52.132]  Because he stood firm on the left and CNN.
[00:14:54.502 --> 00:14:59.245]  And the New York Times, all these groups trained and hired because they hate America, because they're globalist collaborators.
[00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:01.406]  They can't stand to see a strong real president.
[00:15:01.646 --> 00:15:03.307]  They can't stand to see the country coming back.
[00:15:03.387 --> 00:15:04.848]  They don't know what to do.
[00:15:05.108 --> 00:15:11.571]  So they're throwing everything they've got at midterms to try to have illegal aliens vote and people vote the names of dead peoples.
[00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:15.273]  And they just don't know what to do.
[00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:19.456]  They just don't know how they're going to do this.
[00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:23.318]  So now they've jumped the shark and engaged in massive censorship.
[00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:34.310]  Which shows that they're censors and said in thousands of papers and universities everywhere, shut Alex Jones up and shut everybody else up, including U.S.
[00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:42.914]  Senators and Congresswomen, are showing the horrible nightmare authoritarians they are, thinking you're so stupid you won't recognize it, and do something about it.
[00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:46.794]  This is an incredible time to be alive right now.
[00:15:46.814 --> 00:15:49.537]  An amazing time to see this battle for the republic.
[00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:51.879]  The second American Revolution goes global.
[00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:52.539]  1776 worldwide.
[00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:53.340]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:16:02.413 --> 00:16:20.703]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:20.803 --> 00:16:26.706]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:27.766]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:28.206 --> 00:16:31.028]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:31.688 --> 00:16:32.668]  And so much more.
[00:16:33.229 --> 00:16:34.349]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:34.569 --> 00:16:36.290]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:41.992]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:42.112 --> 00:16:43.312]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:43.332 --> 00:16:45.273]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:45.353 --> 00:16:47.713]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:47.934 --> 00:16:49.194]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:49.374 --> 00:16:51.175]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:51.735 --> 00:16:52.335]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:52.435 --> 00:16:53.756]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:53.876 --> 00:16:55.036]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:08.132]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:08.692]  You're on the air.
[00:17:08.712 --> 00:17:09.233]  Thanks for holding.
[00:17:09.633 --> 00:17:10.753]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:17:10.933 --> 00:17:11.333]  Hey, brother.
[00:17:11.353 --> 00:17:11.553]  Sir.
[00:17:11.854 --> 00:17:12.214]  Good, man.
[00:17:12.234 --> 00:17:13.034]  Thank you for calling.
[00:17:13.134 --> 00:17:13.654]  Hey, hey.
[00:17:13.774 --> 00:17:18.176]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:17:18.396 --> 00:17:24.758]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:17:24.779 --> 00:17:26.599]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[00:17:26.699 --> 00:17:32.862]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:17:34.002 --> 00:17:35.123]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:17:35.183 --> 00:17:39.187]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:17:39.587 --> 00:17:41.189]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:42.370]  And exactly.
[00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.614]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:17:46.994 --> 00:17:47.254]  Boom!
[00:17:47.394 --> 00:17:50.237]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:17:50.297 --> 00:17:50.817]  It's amazing.
[00:17:50.857 --> 00:17:55.121]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:04.400]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.124]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[00:18:08.485 --> 00:18:18.017]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[00:18:18.517 --> 00:18:18.898]  ...study.
[00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.942]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:27.248]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[00:18:27.308 --> 00:18:29.671]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[00:18:29.951 --> 00:18:34.557]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[00:18:34.597 --> 00:18:35.218]  Ah, you don't want that.
[00:18:35.598 --> 00:18:39.399]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.301]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:45.862]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.

[00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.252]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:33.078]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:45.485]  So, in the United States of America, CNN is openly full-time lobbying to have InfoWars.com taken off the air.
[00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.650]  They want us kicked off every platform.
[00:20:49.491 --> 00:21:01.854]  They are gleefully pushing to get the number one apps taken down because we're number one with a three-week-old app and they're a joke.
[00:21:02.615 --> 00:21:10.417]  And all their billions of dollars and all the money they get from Gulf state dictators and Communist China and all the things they've done, people can't stand them.
[00:21:12.096 --> 00:21:17.719]  They have to pay to be on at airports, and pay to be on in bars, and pay to be on everywhere.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:19.700]  Very offensive.
[00:21:20.521 --> 00:21:27.425]  I was in the Trump Hotel, beautiful, nice hotel, in the old post office, there in D.C.
[00:21:27.485 --> 00:21:28.746]  a few months ago.
[00:21:29.266 --> 00:21:32.588]  And there was CNN on, on the big television over the bar.
[00:21:32.608 --> 00:21:33.529]  I was gonna throw up.
[00:21:34.529 --> 00:21:37.131]  I just can't get away from it.
[00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:39.092]  It's all force-fed.
[00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:43.723]  Because everyone you know cannot stand these people.
[00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:49.007]  And now they're all over the news going, he denied that David Hogg was a real student.
[00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:50.388]  Never said that.
[00:21:50.829 --> 00:21:52.370]  He says they're crisis actors.
[00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.070]  Never said that.
[00:21:53.571 --> 00:21:54.992]  He says the shooting didn't happen.
[00:21:55.032 --> 00:21:55.693]  Never said that.
[00:21:56.033 --> 00:22:09.204]  But they think if they say it enough, that somehow I shot the people there instead of the government standing down, Nick Cruz being in one of these leftist programs, where they let him
[00:22:11.209 --> 00:22:20.252]  Off of all these different crimes as part of a program for quote minorities so that they don't get sent into the prison system.
[00:22:23.653 --> 00:22:24.734]  But he wasn't even a minority.
[00:22:24.774 --> 00:22:26.154]  His last name was just Cruz.
[00:22:26.474 --> 00:22:27.695]  He was a white kid.
[00:22:30.776 --> 00:22:34.437]  So these people are like smiling demonic jack-o'-lanterns at CNN.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.701]  Stelter all of them.
[00:22:37.101 --> 00:22:40.883]  Up there, one minute saying Trump criticizing the press is anti-free speech.
[00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:43.044]  No, that's called free speech countering you liars.
[00:22:44.005 --> 00:22:44.826]  He wants to kill us.
[00:22:44.886 --> 00:22:46.086]  He wants blood, they say.
[00:22:46.106 --> 00:22:48.128]  He's gonna cause terrorism.
[00:22:48.168 --> 00:22:49.528]  He's gonna cause all this violence.
[00:22:50.089 --> 00:22:55.352]  Then, they're calling for real violence, for uprisings, and all this other garbage.
[00:23:00.171 --> 00:23:06.793]  And then the next segment they'll call for me and others to be banned off the internet saying we're fake news, when that's all objective.
[00:23:07.414 --> 00:23:07.974]  Subjective.
[00:23:08.634 --> 00:23:11.395]  It's all what you see, what you think, what you research.
[00:23:14.336 --> 00:23:15.416]  So we've reached a new level.
[00:23:15.616 --> 00:23:22.399]  You know, I should have started the broadcast with this, but the China news is so huge that they're claiming all the South China Sea and firing on US ships.
[00:23:22.959 --> 00:23:25.160]  It's just amazing what's happening in Turkey and
[00:23:26.462 --> 00:23:26.722]  The U.S.
[00:23:26.762 --> 00:23:38.330]  Capitol ramping up security ahead of white nationalist rallies, and they've got the one-year anniversary of Charlottesville coming up, where the police corralled the alt-right people right into the antifa so the explosion could happen.
[00:23:39.031 --> 00:23:42.613]  And by Soros funding that, he's partially to blame for the poor woman that died.
[00:23:44.895 --> 00:23:52.040]  That turned into them spinning it and saying that I said the CIA staged it, and that some photographer staged it, when that's not what I said.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.962]  They just twisted that and sued me for that!
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:04.428]  Everybody knows that in Portland, and in San Francisco, and in Charlottesville, and in Maryland, the police have stood down.
[00:24:04.688 --> 00:24:06.710]  We even have the documents in Maryland.
[00:24:09.253 --> 00:24:16.279]  In Baltimore, where the Antifa was working with them and even had designated areas they were allowed to protest and engage in violence.
[00:24:17.341 --> 00:24:24.503]  And even throw things at police as part of an attempt to escalate the general public into rioting to bring in a civil emergency for Obama.
[00:24:24.783 --> 00:24:26.063]  But the plan failed.
[00:24:26.903 --> 00:24:32.044]  Go to Infowars.com or search Engine It.
[00:24:32.064 --> 00:24:39.626]  2015 plan to bring in martial law for Obama.
[00:24:39.766 --> 00:24:44.607]  Documents show 2015 plan to bring in civil emergency and martial law in Maryland.
[00:24:45.746 --> 00:24:48.948]  Read the documents for yourself, and that's why they want to shut down.
[00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:54.050]  Because they don't want the future plans they've got coming out.
[00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:55.691]  There it is.
[00:24:55.751 --> 00:24:58.973]  Documents to Tell Plan for Civil Unrest and Martial Law in Baltimore.
[00:24:59.313 --> 00:25:01.174]  That broke January 20th of this year.
[00:25:01.514 --> 00:25:02.715]  I suggest everyone read it.
[00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:05.316]  That's why they want InfoWars shut down.
[00:25:05.376 --> 00:25:07.057]  That's why they're trying to shut our servers down.
[00:25:07.077 --> 00:25:09.158]  Oh, people go, oh, it's just a private company.
[00:25:09.178 --> 00:25:11.219]  Oh, well, now we're going to have your server company shut you down.
[00:25:13.596 --> 00:25:14.577]  Oh, it's just a private company.
[00:25:14.597 --> 00:25:16.239]  Now you can't ride the bus or the airplane.
[00:25:16.659 --> 00:25:20.583]  This is a global China social score system of total control.
[00:25:21.344 --> 00:25:22.945]  And look, scroll back up if you're a TV viewer.
[00:25:23.446 --> 00:25:23.966]  Scroll back up.
[00:25:24.266 --> 00:25:27.930]  You can see that our video report documenting it has been removed.
[00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.210]  See?
[00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:32.895]  Ah, they're scrubbing more and more and more and more.
[00:25:33.175 --> 00:25:34.797]  They're getting their job done.
[00:25:36.172 --> 00:26:00.251]  Not only is CNN a propped up, failed, anti-free speech, anti-American engine of lies that murder the truth, they're now out murdering free speech and murdering other people's ideas and engaged in classic racketeering like the brown shirts in Nazi Germany, working in concert to go around to private companies and try to have us de-platformed from basic services.
[00:26:00.952 --> 00:26:02.453]  But you better bake that gay cake.
[00:26:02.673 --> 00:26:03.054]  Okay!
[00:26:03.654 --> 00:26:04.515]  But I don't get
[00:26:05.765 --> 00:26:07.126]  My electricity next, I guess.
[00:26:08.988 --> 00:26:10.109]  And here's the big enchilada.
[00:26:10.129 --> 00:26:11.350]  When we come back, I'm gonna say it.
[00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.591]  I should have started the show with this.
[00:26:12.631 --> 00:26:19.397]  This is the big, big, big issue that hit me so hard last week and hit me again this morning when I was really cogitating and thinking deeply about this.
[00:26:20.678 --> 00:26:22.499]  They're gonna make their move on Trump the next three months.
[00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:24.181]  They're making their move on free speech now.
[00:26:24.401 --> 00:26:25.502]  This is unprecedented.
[00:26:27.523 --> 00:26:33.325]  Criminality that we're witnessing and that signifies that they are getting ready to make their move in a big way.
[00:26:33.805 --> 00:26:35.286]  Now some of the things you can do to counter them.
[00:26:35.686 --> 00:26:38.207]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:26:38.267 --> 00:26:44.209]  Go subscribe to our podcast directly where it's super hard for them to stop us from getting information to you.
[00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:46.029]  It's going to be critical as things unfold.
[00:26:46.409 --> 00:26:48.810]  They don't want us on air when all this goes down.
[00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.071]  They don't want us advising the president.
[00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.372]  They don't want the military and the police listening, which they do.
[00:26:55.532 --> 00:26:59.015]  You've got to counter them and say, learn why they don't want you to hear Jones.
[00:26:59.055 --> 00:27:01.917]  Go directly to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:27:03.398 --> 00:27:07.522]  Sure, the Android and Apple app, it's good to be number one on news.
[00:27:07.562 --> 00:27:11.525]  It's good to be in the top, you know, 30 of all apps when it's only a three and a half week old app.
[00:27:11.905 --> 00:27:13.927]  It sends a big message to the censors that they're failing.
[00:27:16.118 --> 00:27:18.861]  But the number one issue is, we're only a canary in the coal mine.
[00:27:19.061 --> 00:27:22.425]  They're going after everybody right now, big time.
[00:27:23.065 --> 00:27:28.171]  And they've now announced, I've got a stack of news I haven't gotten to yet, where they say, get all the other conservatives now.
[00:27:29.192 --> 00:27:31.074]  Shut them all down ahead of the election.
[00:27:31.134 --> 00:27:34.858]  Quote, our democracy depends on it, says Senator Murphy.
[00:27:35.138 --> 00:27:36.720]  What a bizarre statement.
[00:27:38.208 --> 00:27:39.068]  It's so un-American.
[00:27:39.108 --> 00:27:39.809]  It's so naked.
[00:27:39.869 --> 00:27:50.292]  It's so... They're now banning thousands of sites on Facebook and YouTube of scientists and others that criticize man-made global warming and point out it's a giant global carbon tax scam.
[00:27:50.572 --> 00:27:52.173]  They're making their move.
[00:27:52.713 --> 00:27:55.354]  Just like Europe banning criticizing radical Islam.
[00:27:57.751 --> 00:28:03.837]  It's all happening, and they're putting messages up over it in real time, run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, saying it's not true.
[00:28:04.478 --> 00:28:08.802]  Just punk kids that work there are in control of it, and put messages over climate scientists.
[00:28:09.383 --> 00:28:12.386]  They are interposing themselves in front of our communications.
[00:28:12.746 --> 00:28:15.109]  They got rid of the comments on Infowars.com.
[00:28:15.129 --> 00:28:15.989]  They got Discuss Us.
[00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.770]  I think?
[00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:44.055]  The different scenarios that are all in one general path, but different permutations of that on the other side.
[00:28:44.095 --> 00:28:48.118]  But currently, we are in an economic and covert military war with China.
[00:28:48.558 --> 00:28:56.645]  They've got a lot of collaborators in this country that have officially moved to China, like Tim Cook, and like Google, and Alphabet, its parent company.
[00:29:02.776 --> 00:29:05.678]  Let's go ahead and talk to Make America Great Again, Titan.
[00:29:05.698 --> 00:29:06.959]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:29:07.139 --> 00:29:10.622]  The man, the truth, the resistance, Alex Jones.
[00:29:10.922 --> 00:29:13.424]  I am a Hispanic Trump supporter slash InfoWarrior.
[00:29:13.445 --> 00:29:16.007]  I have a couple points to make, but I want to plug for you real quick.
[00:29:16.067 --> 00:29:19.149]  Survival Shield, Mason Iodine X2, life-changing.
[00:29:19.189 --> 00:29:21.051]  Super Milk Vitality, life-changing.
[00:29:21.111 --> 00:29:22.752]  RainForce Plus, life-changing.
[00:29:22.792 --> 00:29:25.114]  Super Blue Non-Fluoride Toothpaste, life-changing.
[00:29:25.134 --> 00:29:26.535]  I'm sure the rest of them are good products.
[00:29:26.575 --> 00:29:28.597]  I haven't been able to try them all yet, but they're awesome.
[00:29:28.657 --> 00:29:30.298]  The hats, the t-shirts, amazing.
[00:29:30.518 --> 00:29:32.339]  Briefly, tell us what the supplements did for you.
[00:29:32.359 --> 00:29:33.580]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.361]  Just like you, I'm about the same body type.
[00:29:35.441 --> 00:29:37.122]  I'm short, stocky, strong guy.
[00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:38.923]  I'm Puerto Rican, Italian, and Cuban.
[00:29:38.983 --> 00:29:40.384]  A Spanish home sport, like I said.
[00:29:40.484 --> 00:29:42.625]  And I started working out every day.
[00:29:42.765 --> 00:29:44.126]  I lift weights every day.
[00:29:44.286 --> 00:29:45.967]  I don't even have to take the day off.
[00:29:46.047 --> 00:29:47.688]  I'm taking the Survival Shield X2.
[00:29:47.748 --> 00:29:48.908]  I drop that every morning.
[00:29:48.948 --> 00:29:49.709]  I feel fantastic.
[00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.949]  My skin is clearing up.
[00:29:50.969 --> 00:29:51.610]  I have psoriasis.
[00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:52.650]  So that's clearing up.
[00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.910]  My hair is going back thicker.
[00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:57.211]  I'm losing some of it, but it's growing back thicker in the areas that I do have it.
[00:29:57.251 --> 00:29:59.192]  The brain force is just amazing.
[00:29:59.252 --> 00:30:00.512]  That stuff makes you think.
[00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:01.753]  It keeps you on your toes.
[00:30:01.793 --> 00:30:02.993]  The same thing with the iodine.
[00:30:03.013 --> 00:30:05.354]  It just brings this clarity and this focus.
[00:30:05.414 --> 00:30:06.755]  And your products are amazing.
[00:30:06.855 --> 00:30:09.155]  It's like a cleansing for the brain when we listen to you.
[00:30:09.535 --> 00:30:11.276]  And it's just life changing.
[00:30:11.336 --> 00:30:13.437]  And how people can go against the true resistance.
[00:30:13.477 --> 00:30:16.198]  They're going to learn soon that they're on the wrong side of history.
[00:30:16.238 --> 00:30:17.258]  And that's why we're the right.
[00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:18.960]  We're not the alt-right, we're just right.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.606]  And I've got to say, I started Titans of Liberty's Truth Wars because of you, Alex.
[00:30:22.626 --> 00:30:24.168]  You are a big inspiration to me.
[00:30:24.208 --> 00:30:24.889]  You're the real deal.
[00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:27.914]  If anybody's listening right now, Alex Jones is the real deal.
[00:30:29.798 --> 00:30:33.981]  Everything we do here at InfoWars is possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:34.021 --> 00:30:35.122]  We have huge specials.
[00:30:35.162 --> 00:30:38.744]  If you've not seen the InfoWars Store yet, go check it out.
[00:30:39.184 --> 00:30:43.627]  New t-shirts at the InfoWars Store as well, including one that I just got.
[00:30:44.048 --> 00:30:46.629]  The new InfoWars hexagon logo.
[00:30:46.829 --> 00:30:48.751]  Very, very cool logo.
[00:30:49.191 --> 00:30:54.915]  And kind of more discreet, so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.
[00:30:55.175 --> 00:30:58.037]  So it's all possible thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:58.057 --> 00:30:59.518]  Huge discount store-wide right now.
[00:30:59.818 --> 00:31:03.140]  Trump is representing America, likely for the United States.
[00:31:03.921 --> 00:31:05.702]  I am so sorry, sir.
[00:31:05.942 --> 00:31:07.163]  I tried to stop him.
[00:31:07.203 --> 00:31:08.603]  Not your fault, sweetheart.
[00:31:08.644 --> 00:31:11.285]  Can't stop a man who jumped 36 greyhounds in the end.
[00:31:11.305 --> 00:31:12.206]  It's all right, Lucy.
[00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:17.069]  I'll do this for you.
[00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.249]  Yes.
[00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:21.952]  Mr. Banks, do you know what Chuck Berry said every night before counting 1, 2, 3, 4?
[00:31:22.232 --> 00:31:25.934]  What did he say?
[00:31:26.334 --> 00:31:27.055]  Pay me my money!
[00:31:28.524 --> 00:31:31.007]  Well, I'm sure my people will be in cash.
[00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:51.489]  And yet we're paying a lot of money to protect.
[00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:53.491]  Now, this has been going on for decades.
[00:31:54.152 --> 00:32:01.799]  This has been brought up by other presidents, but other presidents never did anything about it because I don't think they understood it or they just didn't want to get involved.
[00:32:02.719 --> 00:32:05.702]  But I have to bring it up because I think it's very unfair to our country.
[00:32:05.722 --> 00:32:07.263]  It's very unfair to our taxpayer.
[00:32:08.264 --> 00:32:12.948]  And I think that these countries have to step it up, not over a 10 year period, they have to step it up immediately.
[00:32:13.289 --> 00:32:14.590]  Germany is a rich country.
[00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:18.533]  They talk about they could increase it a tiny bit by 2030.
[00:32:20.375 --> 00:32:24.839]  Well, they could increase it immediately tomorrow and have no problem.
[00:32:24.859 --> 00:32:26.840]  I don't think it's fair to the United States.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.603]  So we're going to have to do something because we're not going to put up with it.
[00:32:30.663 --> 00:32:31.604]  We can't put up with it.
[00:32:31.764 --> 00:32:33.466]  And it's inappropriate.
[00:32:37.338 --> 00:32:40.341]  Would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the n-word?
[00:32:41.362 --> 00:32:45.967]  Would you support a group that hits women and disabled veterans and attacks minorities and transgenders?
[00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:49.351]  Would you support a group that intimidates the public with weapons of war?
[00:32:49.912 --> 00:32:53.736]  What if that same group had been caught lobbying explosives into a crowd of innocent people?
[00:32:54.356 --> 00:32:55.377]  I wouldn't support that group.
[00:32:55.698 --> 00:32:55.998]  Would you?
[00:32:56.018 --> 00:32:58.901]  This has been a public service announcement from InfoWars.com
[00:33:04.056 --> 00:33:06.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.169 --> 00:33:14.571]  We are drugged out!
[00:33:15.252 --> 00:33:17.516]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:33:18.647 --> 00:33:20.888]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:33:21.449 --> 00:33:23.010]  Today, it all changes.
[00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.832]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:33:26.072 --> 00:33:28.933]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:33:28.953 --> 00:33:33.616]  Einstein says the death and event insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[00:33:33.897 --> 00:33:36.538]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:33:36.558 --> 00:33:39.080]  How are we gonna get a different result out of hate?
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.341]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:33:41.841 --> 00:33:43.262]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:33:43.482 --> 00:33:44.343]  We have the resources.
[00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:51.248]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[00:33:51.428 --> 00:33:52.769]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.511]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[00:33:54.551 --> 00:33:55.432]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:33:55.632 --> 00:33:56.553]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:33:56.713 --> 00:33:58.935]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:33:59.095 --> 00:34:02.778]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:07.822]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:08.403 --> 00:34:10.144]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:17.443 --> 00:34:21.164]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:22.345]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[00:34:22.425 --> 00:34:23.305]  Alex Jones.
[00:34:23.405 --> 00:34:24.125]  From InfoWars.
[00:34:24.205 --> 00:34:24.986]  InfoWars.
[00:34:25.026 --> 00:34:25.226]  Yeah.
[00:34:25.366 --> 00:34:26.006]  Alex Jones.
[00:34:26.126 --> 00:34:26.926]  Alex Jones.
[00:34:26.986 --> 00:34:30.368]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[00:34:30.428 --> 00:34:33.229]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[00:34:33.309 --> 00:34:38.170]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:42.812]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[00:34:43.032 --> 00:34:45.053]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[00:34:45.714 --> 00:34:48.435]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[00:34:48.475 --> 00:34:57.721]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:34:57.741 --> 00:34:59.442]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:34:59.482 --> 00:35:01.723]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[00:35:01.763 --> 00:35:04.285]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[00:35:07.924 --> 00:35:10.645]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[00:35:10.705 --> 00:35:13.306]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:19.949]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[00:35:19.989 --> 00:35:22.150]  If Trump gets elected, he's gonna be Secretary of Defense.
[00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.291]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[00:35:24.371 --> 00:35:25.211]  Move, bitch!
[00:35:25.552 --> 00:35:26.692]  Get out the way!
[00:35:26.812 --> 00:35:28.813]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[00:35:29.073 --> 00:35:30.254]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[00:35:31.814 --> 00:35:32.935]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:33.115 --> 00:35:34.016]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:34.176 --> 00:35:35.197]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:35.257 --> 00:35:36.137]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:35:36.277 --> 00:35:38.399]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:45.903]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:35:46.484 --> 00:35:47.865]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:35:55.481 --> 00:35:59.082]  You know why InfoWars is still on Twitter, but banned everywhere else?
[00:35:59.302 --> 00:36:09.325]  By Apple, by Google, by Facebook, by Spotify, by Stitcher, by WebChimp, by Disqus.
[00:36:10.586 --> 00:36:16.527]  They even have the Democrats going after our servers, trying to file false reports on those to get our servers taken down.
[00:36:16.547 --> 00:36:17.448]  We could go down anytime.
[00:36:18.988 --> 00:36:20.969]  That's what's happening in America right now.
[00:36:21.609 --> 00:36:24.290]  The only reason we're still on Twitter is because of this tweet from the President.
[00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.050]  Twitter!
[00:36:26.781 --> 00:36:28.923]  Shadowbanning prominent Republicans.
[00:36:29.343 --> 00:36:29.883]  Not good.
[00:36:29.903 --> 00:36:34.146]  We will look into this discriminatory legal practice at once.
[00:36:34.907 --> 00:36:35.748]  Many complaints.
[00:36:38.009 --> 00:36:42.452]  And look, I welcome Jack Dorsey not being the vanguard of censorship like he's been the last few years.
[00:36:42.472 --> 00:36:45.234]  Twitter's a very interesting thing he invented.
[00:36:45.274 --> 00:36:45.895]  Very, very nice.
[00:36:46.856 --> 00:36:50.498]  The problem is they let Democrats be as violent and threatening and out of control as they want.
[00:36:50.558 --> 00:36:51.419]  Islamist, you name it.
[00:36:51.879 --> 00:36:53.861]  They take us questioning David Hogg.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:04.045]  Who's in three different videos saying, I was at home when the shooting started, I rode my bike, and then the shooting was over by then, and then him saying he was in the school while the shooting's happening.
[00:37:04.065 --> 00:37:06.246]  And I've got those videos.
[00:37:07.647 --> 00:37:09.107]  And that he was there when it started.
[00:37:09.127 --> 00:37:11.248]  I mean, I've got all the news reports right here.
[00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:12.709]  I've already moved past that.
[00:37:12.769 --> 00:37:14.930]  I'm not saying the school shooting didn't happen.
[00:37:17.392 --> 00:37:22.394]  But you can go to Jamie White's article, update, confusion over where David Hogg was during school shooting.
[00:37:22.695 --> 00:37:24.716]  Three different videos of him saying three different things.
[00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:28.510]  Now, in a free country, I'm allowed to point this out.
[00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:34.051]  If David Hogg thinks that's defamatory, his words, he can sue me, he can win in court.
[00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:38.333]  But just people filing lawsuits on me doesn't mean I get taken off the internet.
[00:37:38.933 --> 00:37:43.354]  Just like they say if Mueller indicts you, it means you're a Russian agent.
[00:37:43.554 --> 00:37:45.575]  But none of the indictments are about espionage.
[00:37:45.775 --> 00:37:46.935]  None of them are about collusion.
[00:37:47.115 --> 00:37:51.376]  It's all about bank accounts from 15 years ago.
[00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:54.117]  Alright, I said I'd get to it.
[00:37:55.282 --> 00:37:59.944]  But a lot was breaking during the break, so a lot I can't get into on air right now.
[00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:04.527]  But I can tell you right now, the White House is watching this very, very closely.
[00:38:05.587 --> 00:38:08.048]  So yeah, Jack Dorsey, Google, all you guys.
[00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.710]  Twitter.
[00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:13.651]  Apple.
[00:38:15.432 --> 00:38:17.193]  You guys have really gone far here.
[00:38:17.893 --> 00:38:19.034]  And Jack Dorsey's smart.
[00:38:20.034 --> 00:38:21.295]  He knows he got singled out.
[00:38:22.676 --> 00:38:23.176]  He knows
[00:38:25.919 --> 00:38:29.521]  That he went a little too far, and El Presidente is looking at him.
[00:38:32.223 --> 00:38:36.725]  And so he's got the people rebelling at Twitter saying, do more, ban them all, purge everyone.
[00:38:36.745 --> 00:38:38.646]  He's like, hold your horses, sweethearts.
[00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:43.689]  We're gonna get him.
[00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.711]  You just gotta be very delicate about it.
[00:38:46.731 --> 00:38:49.573]  I mean, he's been leading the vanguard.
[00:38:52.085 --> 00:38:53.686]  And I welcome him backing off of it.
[00:38:53.746 --> 00:38:56.587]  That's why I went on Hannity, who he knows talks to the President every day.
[00:38:58.147 --> 00:38:59.628]  And said, oh, I'm not censoring anybody.
[00:38:59.688 --> 00:39:00.568]  I'm not shadowbanning.
[00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:01.388]  Really?
[00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:06.050]  That's why as soon as you took the shadowban off us, we went from 20 retweets to 10,000.
[00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:13.672]  The next day after Trump did that, all of our tweets started working again.
[00:39:14.593 --> 00:39:16.433]  They were dialed down to nothing.
[00:39:17.374 --> 00:39:17.994]  To nothing.
[00:39:20.353 --> 00:39:21.294]  And then they play this game.
[00:39:21.354 --> 00:39:22.115]  Nobody's censoring.
[00:39:22.755 --> 00:39:33.565]  But now... They're out in the open... admitting that they're censoring everybody.
[00:39:33.665 --> 00:39:36.728]  And the question is, why are they doing this?
[00:39:36.788 --> 00:39:37.949]  And I'll get to it next segment.
[00:39:37.969 --> 00:39:38.489]  I said I would.
[00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:39.550]  This segment.
[00:39:40.011 --> 00:39:40.731]  I need another earpiece.
[00:39:40.751 --> 00:39:41.752]  I need to throw this one away.
[00:39:42.013 --> 00:39:42.793]  This is the broken one.
[00:39:43.154 --> 00:39:44.375]  I need a good one that keeps popping out.
[00:39:44.395 --> 00:39:45.055]  It's driving me crazy.
[00:39:45.095 --> 00:39:45.296]  Thanks.
[00:39:47.381 --> 00:39:49.223]  I'm just information overload at this point, too.
[00:39:49.263 --> 00:39:50.864]  There is so much insanity going on.
[00:39:52.666 --> 00:39:55.988]  They have said they want an uprising and overthrow of coup d'etat against the president.
[00:39:56.008 --> 00:39:58.170]  They've said they're in a civil war, the last civil war.
[00:39:58.651 --> 00:40:03.335]  They've said that they want to purge all conservatives and patriots off the internet, and now it's happening.
[00:40:05.405 --> 00:40:06.707]  And what are we going to do about it?
[00:40:06.748 --> 00:40:08.290]  They're making their move.
[00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:09.853]  They're making their move.
[00:40:10.354 --> 00:40:11.676]  Because America's coming back.
[00:40:11.756 --> 00:40:12.858]  America's coming together.
[00:40:13.259 --> 00:40:18.568]  The police are turning against Antifa and even places like San Francisco and Berkeley and arresting them and none of the patriots.
[00:40:20.472 --> 00:40:30.037]  We ran into a lot of liberal police in San Francisco who came over to our crew off-record and said, look, I'm a liberal, but I like you guys and know what your real message is and we watch you.
[00:40:30.597 --> 00:40:38.201]  And that's why they went from the police protecting Antifa just a few months ago and letting them beat people up to the police going after them and doing their job.
[00:40:40.322 --> 00:40:47.225]  And not following... Not following...
[00:40:48.595 --> 00:40:51.198]  The illegal orders of their globalist police chief.
[00:40:53.862 --> 00:40:59.029]  And who knows, maybe the police chief isn't a globalist, but they gave bad orders before to sit there and aid to bed this whole situation.
[00:41:00.725 --> 00:41:05.648]  But it's amazing to see CNN running around saying, shut Alex Jones down on Twitter.
[00:41:05.948 --> 00:41:07.909]  He says David Hogg is a crisis actor.
[00:41:08.209 --> 00:41:10.631]  He says David Hogg wasn't there during the shooting.
[00:41:10.851 --> 00:41:11.952]  He says no shooting happened.
[00:41:12.012 --> 00:41:12.952]  I said no such thing.
[00:41:13.233 --> 00:41:14.593]  I said he's in the drama club.
[00:41:14.934 --> 00:41:23.319]  Out of 3,000 students, four of them get picked who are already anti-gun, who've already given anti-gun speeches, to be the spokespersons for all the other kids.
[00:41:24.139 --> 00:41:27.120]  And then all the other young people don't get to go on the news and sell their point of view.
[00:41:27.681 --> 00:41:39.686]  And then David Hogg leads huge rallies all over the country, calls me a con artist, says I'm a snake oil salesman, and I politely respond back to him, and then they say I'm beating up on some young person and I'm a bully.
[00:41:41.167 --> 00:41:44.809]  Hogg is in a man's world out there blaming gun owners for what happened.
[00:41:45.329 --> 00:41:46.890]  And it's all back again, see?
[00:41:48.888 --> 00:41:50.069]  And they keep running the headlines.
[00:41:50.149 --> 00:41:51.670]  Jones says nobody died at Parkland.
[00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.391]  They cannot find the video.
[00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:54.872]  They cannot find the audio.
[00:41:55.232 --> 00:41:58.014]  With Sandy Hook, because I used to play devil's advocate, they can't.
[00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:04.839]  Because I was looking at all the angles, having people on for debates, looking at anomalies, saying, I can see how it totally happened.
[00:42:04.859 --> 00:42:06.400]  A lot of these parents look very credible.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.721]  And I would say the other.
[00:42:07.841 --> 00:42:09.882]  They take that out and sue me for that.
[00:42:10.222 --> 00:42:11.863]  Obviously, that's protected under the First Amendment.
[00:42:12.063 --> 00:42:14.085]  But now the Democrats are all over the news saying,
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:19.183]  We want to get rid of New York Times vs. Sullivan that defends the free speech.
[00:42:19.623 --> 00:42:21.865]  We want to basically repeal the First Amendment.
[00:42:22.225 --> 00:42:28.711]  That's what they're doing in their desperateness to suppress everybody, so that's why this is so incredibly historic.
[00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:34.976]  Alright, when we come back, I'm going to be very focused, and I'm going to get into
[00:42:37.884 --> 00:42:41.366]  How they may try to take Trump out, what I think is coming next, and why they've shut me off the air.
[00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:45.889]  Because they don't want me to be able to communicate to the full audience ahead of this, so we can't report on it in live time.
[00:42:46.049 --> 00:42:50.691]  Because they know what we say keeps coming true, that our credibility is so high, especially with intelligence agencies and others.
[00:42:50.971 --> 00:42:54.693]  They want us muffled, but it's backfired on them, so what are they going to do now?
[00:42:54.893 --> 00:42:57.655]  And Dinesh D'Souza is coming on, and one of the heroes of Benghazi.
[00:43:00.362 --> 00:43:13.928]  I told you that we could retake America if you believed in capitalism, if you believed in freedom, if you believed in God, if you believed that you had some control over your destiny.
[00:43:14.728 --> 00:43:15.389]  And now we're here.
[00:43:16.545 --> 00:43:23.108]  As we're in the hottest part of the summer, going into the fall, the left is calling for civil war, total censorship of Infowars.
[00:43:23.348 --> 00:43:31.371]  They're lying about the president more than more, calling for violence against him, calling for him to be removed, calling for his family to be kidnapped, murdered, tortured.
[00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:32.672]  It's everywhere.
[00:43:33.212 --> 00:43:38.757]  And then Trump says mainstream media is the enemy of the American people when they're fake news and lying.
[00:43:38.777 --> 00:43:42.360]  They go, oh my God, you're going to cause us to get hurt.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:50.146]  You've got Democrat candidates in Kentucky making jokes and saying, hey, Rand Paul can be beaten for the Senate race.
[00:43:50.467 --> 00:43:51.448]  Look at what his neighbor did.
[00:43:52.008 --> 00:43:52.589]  It's everywhere.
[00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:54.470]  If I try to list it all, it'd take an hour.
[00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:56.992]  They're trying to bully us into submission.
[00:43:58.113 --> 00:44:05.901]  So now more than ever with them all over the news saying de-platform us and lying about what we stand for and filing all these frivolous fake lawsuits that we're getting thrown out.
[00:44:06.562 --> 00:44:07.924]  This is the critical battle.
[00:44:08.184 --> 00:44:09.725]  Getting Trump in was just the beachhead.
[00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:12.468]  Now the real fight for liberty begins.
[00:44:12.849 --> 00:44:14.570]  We're entering the season of false flags.
[00:44:15.849 --> 00:44:22.474]  Uh, where the mainstream media knows it has no viewers, knows that it's basically now just corporate engines of censorship, just like the colleges.
[00:44:22.975 --> 00:44:31.802]  And so, they're putting out the breadcrumbs out there, clearly having their own people, in my view, calling into C-SPAN and, you know, calling for CNN to get shot.
[00:44:33.291 --> 00:44:34.472]  I've been telling you that's coming.
[00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:42.476]  So we need to stop the violence, we need to say no violence, we need to decry violence, so that when and if they stage events, people see through it.
[00:44:43.457 --> 00:44:47.179]  I came out the day the drone attack happened in Venezuela.
[00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:53.894]  Before any other media picks it up and I said, I don't hear any explosions, I don't see any smoke, this looks totally staged in the video I see.
[00:44:54.174 --> 00:44:58.635]  And now even our own government and foreign governments are saying it appears to be a false flag.
[00:44:59.375 --> 00:45:00.836]  False flags do happen.
[00:45:00.896 --> 00:45:02.276]  Some things are real, obviously.
[00:45:02.796 --> 00:45:04.337]  But communists and scumbags...
[00:45:05.037 --> 00:45:08.899]  Like a dictator of Venezuela who has staged elections, I believe has staged this.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:16.364]  So don't think the Democrats, who are totally desperate, won't pull that card of victim when they're building it up, building it up, building it up.
[00:45:16.584 --> 00:45:32.474]  How many months have I been saying we're entering the false flag area, where CNN or MSNBC or these other terrorist organizations against America that terrorize the truth, that lobby for the end of free speech, that lobby for their competitors to be taken off the air, that send out the reporters to stalk people and harass them.
[00:45:33.394 --> 00:45:38.859]  They're murderers and assassins of truth, and don't think their bosses aren't willing to go all the way.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.843]  With that said, there is a way to defeat them and stand against their attempts to shut us down.
[00:45:44.123 --> 00:45:50.068]  Spread the articles, spread the videos, tell people in person about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:53.051]  Download the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:45:53.471 --> 00:45:54.192]  We're good to go.
[00:46:14.252 --> 00:46:27.461]  If you take the challenge at Infowarslife.com and get things that everybody needs like high quality krill oil, fish oil, honor roll for kids, the very best, highest quality, and learn about all the amazing things it does, that funds our operation.
[00:46:27.701 --> 00:46:33.245]  If you sign up for auto ship, you get an additional 10% off that way each month, or every two months, whatever you sign up for.
[00:46:33.505 --> 00:46:34.265]  Cancel any time.
[00:46:35.186 --> 00:46:37.328]  continues to fund it so you don't have to worry about it.
[00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:40.751]  You can get it done and know that you're tithing to the truth.
[00:46:40.791 --> 00:46:41.932]  You're tithing to your future.
[00:46:42.152 --> 00:46:50.098]  You're tithing against tyranny for liberty to an operation that you know has the enemy absolutely insanely mad.
[00:46:50.619 --> 00:46:52.841]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the InfoWar.
[00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:54.242]  Now it's up to you!
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.642]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.971 --> 00:47:24.192]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:47:24.673 --> 00:47:27.134]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:47:27.674 --> 00:47:29.956]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.449]  John Tig Tijen is going to be joining us, one of the patriot heroes of Benghazi.
[00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:41.600]  I see him as just a big of heroes, bucking against Hillary and Obama and telling the truth about what happened when they were being threatened.
[00:47:43.436 --> 00:47:49.458]  I know what it's like to go up against the Clintons and Obama and it's not fun in public or behind the scenes.
[00:47:49.998 --> 00:47:51.378]  He's going to be joining us in studio.
[00:47:51.398 --> 00:47:53.399]  He's speaking outside Austin this weekend.
[00:47:53.739 --> 00:47:56.880]  I'm tempted to take my kids out there so they can see what a real American looks like.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.741]  He'll be in studio coming up.
[00:47:59.201 --> 00:48:03.262]  And then Dinesh D'Souza joins us coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:48:03.842 --> 00:48:05.743]  Political prisoner pardoned by the President.
[00:48:05.963 --> 00:48:08.203]  Number two documentary filmmaker in world history.
[00:48:09.124 --> 00:48:11.044]  He'd be number one if Hollywood wasn't suppressing him.
[00:48:11.504 --> 00:48:12.745]  His new film, Death of a Nation.
[00:48:13.846 --> 00:48:21.629]  Is the antidote to the horrible KKK film, Birth of a Nation, and I don't normally get tears in my eyes during a film, but this was powerful.
[00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:31.112]  Because it reminded me, it's so accurate, I'm quite the history buff, of just how evil the Democrats are, and just how consciously wicked they are.
[00:48:34.528 --> 00:48:36.249]  It is a film that they're trying to suppress.
[00:48:36.369 --> 00:48:37.430]  Everybody needs to go see it.
[00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:38.230]  That is coming up.
[00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:47.815]  And everybody also needs to go to Infowars.com forward slash show and not just sign up for the free apps or sign up for the free newsletter, sign up for the free podcast so they can't censor you as easily.
[00:48:47.835 --> 00:48:53.618]  Getting to me and getting to our other broadcasters and guests who are the real tip of the spear here.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.001]  You can then tell everybody you know, hey, you know Alex Jones?
[00:48:59.882 --> 00:49:00.702]  The forbidden thing?
[00:49:00.962 --> 00:49:03.804]  Why don't you hear what he's actually saying, not what
[00:49:05.353 --> 00:49:20.745]  The Democrats, I mean, they had most of the Democratic Party online and on Twitter and on CNN, I can't even keep track of it, thousands of articles a day, saying that I'm a Nazi, and that I'm a terrorist, and that I want violence, and all these things out of context, edited, none of it's even true.
[00:49:21.546 --> 00:49:24.188]  It's crazy to watch their giant psy-op.
[00:49:24.208 --> 00:49:26.590]  There's an article I'm gonna get to,
[00:49:28.359 --> 00:49:33.603]  What the intelligence community's insurance policy on the president would look like.
[00:49:34.143 --> 00:49:35.264]  It's a Hill article.
[00:49:35.824 --> 00:49:40.808]  And if you read what they're doing to Trump and then think about what they're doing to Infowars, this is the blueprint for everybody.
[00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:46.992]  Julian Assange has been on house arrest, the Ecuadorian embassy for six years.
[00:49:47.673 --> 00:49:49.294]  Tommy Robinson, you know, prison.
[00:49:50.742 --> 00:49:53.543]  They're trying to de-platform me and destroy me and sue me out of existence.
[00:49:53.883 --> 00:50:00.405]  This is what it looks like in 21st century information warfare to retake this country from the globalists and from the chi-comps.
[00:50:00.885 --> 00:50:01.726]  And it's all coming out.
[00:50:04.027 --> 00:50:06.347]  So let's go ahead and get into what's happening.
[00:50:08.208 --> 00:50:13.910]  When they started de-platforming us two weeks ago, I said, as soon as they're successful with us, and I said, and they're going to do it,
[00:50:17.793 --> 00:50:19.994]  They're going to come after everybody else.
[00:50:20.114 --> 00:50:24.076]  Because I was reading what the Democratic Party websites were saying last week.
[00:50:24.316 --> 00:50:31.559]  They were saying, when we get Jones down, we want Steven Crowder, and we want all these other people down.
[00:50:32.499 --> 00:50:36.060]  Because Steven Crowder, even with shadowbanning, his average video has 2 million views.
[00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:37.481]  Everything he does is a hit.
[00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:42.683]  I go to my kid's school, I go to mainline high schools with my kids for sporting events.
[00:50:43.423 --> 00:50:44.484]  Do you know Steven Crowder?
[00:50:46.291 --> 00:50:48.172]  They know who I am, but they don't.
[00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:49.452]  You know Paul Watson.
[00:50:49.472 --> 00:50:50.112]  He works for you.
[00:50:50.413 --> 00:50:51.333]  You know Steven Crowder.
[00:50:52.093 --> 00:51:01.077]  So, smart, funny, good-looking guys who are very appealing across the board and promoting America, they want them shut down, period.
[00:51:02.057 --> 00:51:03.378]  And now, it's been announced.
[00:51:04.158 --> 00:51:04.998]  He is the next target.
[00:51:05.678 --> 00:51:07.759]  And man, he's really polite, but effective.
[00:51:08.279 --> 00:51:12.081]  And if they're calling him hate, because you can take stuff I say out of context and twist it.
[00:51:13.869 --> 00:51:15.851]  Crowder is very scripted.
[00:51:15.871 --> 00:51:16.611]  I don't mean that in a mean way.
[00:51:16.631 --> 00:51:17.832]  He's a famous actor in his own right.
[00:51:17.852 --> 00:51:18.553]  Famous child actor.
[00:51:18.573 --> 00:51:21.055]  So he's able to then really do a lot of preparation and do what he does.
[00:51:21.795 --> 00:51:25.318]  And it's because he is effective and is getting liberals to walk away is why they want him shut down.
[00:51:25.358 --> 00:51:26.179]  But I'm digressing.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.802]  I said they're going to shut everybody down.
[00:51:30.762 --> 00:51:31.523]  Ahead of the midterms.
[00:51:31.563 --> 00:51:32.243]  They know they're losing.
[00:51:32.263 --> 00:51:32.744]  They're panicking.
[00:51:34.465 --> 00:51:37.207]  But they've also said they're going to have low-intensity warfare.
[00:51:37.487 --> 00:51:39.849]  They're not going to just burn trash cans and knock some windows out.
[00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:42.211]  They have said that they're going to start killing cops.
[00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:44.512]  This is what the Antifa internal leaks are.
[00:51:45.053 --> 00:51:49.696]  They're going to start hitting some Republican congressmen, like they've already done at the baseball field.
[00:51:50.156 --> 00:51:53.499]  They're going to shoot their Republican neighbors, city council members.
[00:51:53.879 --> 00:51:59.083]  They are all just being told through the ether, like an Al-Qaeda type situation, where there's no cells.
[00:51:59.363 --> 00:52:01.605]  They just put out the order and then
[00:52:03.544 --> 00:52:06.807]  People that are adherents out there through the web, they carry it out.
[00:52:06.868 --> 00:52:11.452]  And all of that is being amplified, all of that is being pushed, all of that is being hammered.
[00:52:13.635 --> 00:52:24.886]  And so, they want enough civil unrest in the country about a month before the midterms, and they're openly pushing to have the 25th Amendment invoked by the cabinet, with enough threats on them and their families.
[00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:35.878]  To then remove Trump, but they want the uprising in the background like they did when they backed the Arab Spring against their allies in areas like Egypt.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:52.451]  This is the classic Soros-style, leftist State Department-style shake-and-bake operation, or why they staged Benghazi to ship the weapons into Syria, to start that level, to collapse it into Turkey, to open up the migration zone into Europe for the Islamic invasion, which they now admit is official.
[00:52:54.673 --> 00:53:13.106]  So, they wouldn't make, here's the bottom line, they wouldn't make such a bold, full-throated attack on the First Amendment, and absolute racketeering, corporate coordination between three trillion dollars of capital.
[00:53:14.067 --> 00:53:21.252]  You take the six companies that have blacklisted me, and they call it a blacklist, they're now calling it censorship, unpersoning, putting me into the phantom zone.
[00:53:22.225 --> 00:53:25.446]  Three trillion dollars is what they're estimated at, about 3.1 trillion.
[00:53:27.907 --> 00:53:34.889]  So three plus trillion dollars of companies that have moved to China are muscling in on America and they demonize me first.
[00:53:35.289 --> 00:53:38.170]  I'm the target because Hillary called me dark art, knows we were effective.
[00:53:39.377 --> 00:53:43.483]  They're rebooting Americana, and they know that we're growing exponentially, so they got scared.
[00:53:43.503 --> 00:53:45.005]  They've already dialed back 93%.
[00:53:45.566 --> 00:53:52.416]  All the other conservative and nationalist sites, any type of pro-military group, pro-Trump group, they're all banned.
[00:53:54.099 --> 00:53:54.840]  They're all blocked.
[00:53:57.006 --> 00:53:58.227]  But everybody else is already 93%.
[00:53:58.987 --> 00:54:00.969]  Paul Watson is left alone.
[00:54:01.029 --> 00:54:02.029]  He works with Infowars.
[00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:06.032]  But he's 97% because we have the analytics.
[00:54:06.592 --> 00:54:07.533]  We have the server logs.
[00:54:08.213 --> 00:54:09.995]  When they turn us off, man, they just flip a switch.
[00:54:11.375 --> 00:54:22.623]  So they wouldn't make a super ultra crazy bold move like this, which is right out of the Soviet Union, right out of Nazi Germany, unless they
[00:54:24.033 --> 00:54:26.715]  Are planning to go for broke on every front, and now they're doing it.
[00:54:26.875 --> 00:54:32.018]  So, civil unrest, targeted assassinations, destabilization ops, but here's the big one.
[00:54:32.979 --> 00:54:48.229]  They're going to try, I believe in October, history mirrors itself, and it generally comes in late September into early mid-October, they're going to try a stock market crash, with civil unrest, in October.
[00:54:55.379 --> 00:55:01.524]  I just can't believe the globalists are siding with the shy comms and Hollywood's doing this and that all these crazy people don't want America to come back.
[00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:04.146]  I mean, everybody's been serving the globalists kind of half-assed.
[00:55:04.166 --> 00:55:05.047]  You didn't know what you were doing.
[00:55:05.548 --> 00:55:09.010]  You really should be joining the American team right now because we finally got a real president.
[00:55:09.211 --> 00:55:17.418]  The country's coming back and this is crazy what you're doing because if they're able to plunge the stock market and bring in civil unrest bad enough to remove Trump, they're going to go for broke.
[00:55:18.427 --> 00:55:20.529]  And they're going to activate all sorts of sleeper cells.
[00:55:21.289 --> 00:55:22.270]  They're working with Iran.
[00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:23.491]  We know the left's working with Iran.
[00:55:23.531 --> 00:55:26.053]  They've got real sleeper cells, not like the fake al-Qaeda ones.
[00:55:26.333 --> 00:55:28.815]  They're going to start doing all sorts of nasty stuff.
[00:55:30.056 --> 00:55:31.997]  I wouldn't want to be in an apartment building, I'll tell you that.
[00:55:32.017 --> 00:55:35.620]  Because I know what Hezbollah's planning.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.701]  They're going to dump chlorine gas down your air conditioners.
[00:55:38.675 --> 00:55:41.860]  About 8 o'clock at night, so, when everybody's sitting around to have dinner.
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.825]  So, I mean, can you imagine the panic when you got 5,000 people dead in a building in an hour?
[00:55:45.846 --> 00:55:53.557]  I mean, they are ready, they are lined up, they are, this is how wars begin, and they think they're taking America down right now.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.602]  Now China started buckling and backing off on sanctions against the U.S.
[00:56:01.463 --> 00:56:02.043]  in the trade war.
[00:56:02.243 --> 00:56:03.244]  But they fired on U.S.
[00:56:03.264 --> 00:56:07.726]  ships six warning shots and said, get out of the area immediately or we'll attack you.
[00:56:08.067 --> 00:56:09.367]  So this is a crazy time.
[00:56:09.407 --> 00:56:13.630]  And all these powerful forces have used our open society against us to try to bring our country down.
[00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:18.533]  And they wouldn't be making a bold move like this unless they were planning to go for broke.
[00:56:18.553 --> 00:56:22.295]  So everybody better get maximum engaged politically.
[00:56:22.935 --> 00:56:29.826]  But also spend some of your time, I'd say 80% engage politically, 20% of the time they start killing political leaders and patriots.
[00:56:31.573 --> 00:56:35.276]  If you're a political leader or a patriot in your area and you don't even think of yourself as a leader, you're on a list.
[00:56:35.556 --> 00:56:38.378]  They've got leftists coming to your house to kill you.
[00:56:38.418 --> 00:56:44.863]  When they initiate this operation, if they really go for Trump and everybody else, they're not going to just take Trump out.
[00:56:45.083 --> 00:56:47.745]  They're going to go after Ron Paul, Senator Paul.
[00:56:48.065 --> 00:56:48.845]  They're going to go after me.
[00:56:48.886 --> 00:56:49.686]  They're going to go after you.
[00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:51.307]  They're going to go after judges.
[00:56:51.587 --> 00:56:52.868]  They're going to go after the Supreme Court.
[00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:57.312]  Let me tell you, they might set a nuke off in Congress.
[00:56:58.345 --> 00:57:00.928]  There is no link they won't go.
[00:57:00.988 --> 00:57:02.069]  This is World War 4.
[00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:06.835]  The Cold War was World War 3, according to the CIA, and I agree with that.
[00:57:07.095 --> 00:57:08.117]  This is World War 4.
[00:57:08.237 --> 00:57:08.777]  This is it.
[00:57:09.478 --> 00:57:11.040]  Everybody better decide which side they're on.
[00:57:13.695 --> 00:57:14.515]  We're running huge.
[00:57:14.595 --> 00:57:15.336]  Stop the bullies.

[00:57:50.464 --> 00:57:53.587]  The President of the United States is racist.
[00:57:54.288 --> 00:57:55.028]  He's a punk.
[00:57:56.009 --> 00:57:56.770]  He's a dog.
[00:57:57.571 --> 00:57:58.251]  He's a pig.
[00:57:58.432 --> 00:57:59.673]  And he can suck my f***ing d***.
[00:58:00.133 --> 00:58:02.596]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[00:58:02.736 --> 00:58:07.220]  Kiss my motherf***ing ass, you bitch, punk, d*** sucker.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.701]  The President of the United States
[00:58:09.642 --> 00:58:13.106]  He's not only unfit to be president.
[00:58:13.207 --> 00:58:18.813]  In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage, he's unfit to be human.
[00:58:18.873 --> 00:58:22.538]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[00:58:22.558 --> 00:58:25.582]  This is CNN.
[00:58:30.703 --> 00:58:35.168]  Donald J. Trump is President of the United States.
[00:58:52.524 --> 00:59:01.411]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[01:00:09.949 --> 01:00:11.453]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.075 --> 01:00:29.077]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:29.097 --> 01:00:31.162]  Vanessa Souza is with us for the next 30 minutes.
[01:00:31.382 --> 01:00:38.817]  One of the great heroes of the Benghazi War, and an even bigger hero for telling the truth against Hillary, and maybe even winning the election, joining us in studio.
[01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:43.871]  Dinesh D'Souza is with us.
[01:00:43.951 --> 01:00:47.874]  He is the number two biggest filmmaker in history, and that's being a Hollywood outsider.
[01:00:48.174 --> 01:00:51.817]  He's also a number one New York Times best-selling author of Death of a Nation.
[01:00:52.257 --> 01:00:59.703]  You can find all that at bigliebook.com and on Twitter for now at Dinesh D'Souza, Facebook Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:02.165]  His film has been in the top ten as it opened.
[01:01:02.185 --> 01:01:03.786]  He's had one film that's been number one.
[01:01:04.947 --> 01:01:07.408]  And he joins us now to talk about the film.
[01:01:07.769 --> 01:01:09.250]  I saw it about a week after it came out.
[01:01:10.407 --> 01:01:16.872]  And my wife, who's pretty informed, but you know, she's kind of like a libertarian, she said, I knew a lot of this, but I didn't.
[01:01:16.892 --> 01:01:17.893]  And she said, is that accurate?
[01:01:17.913 --> 01:01:19.895]  And I said, it's deadly accurate.
[01:01:19.915 --> 01:01:25.719]  We went home that night, and as my parents would babysit the kids, and we spent like two hours looking at history.
[01:01:25.739 --> 01:01:28.021]  And she goes, gosh, I didn't know all this.
[01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:29.082]  And exactly.
[01:01:29.162 --> 01:01:31.504]  This is a big hoax that's been exposed.
[01:01:31.684 --> 01:01:34.767]  And if it gets out, I think it could win the midterms.
[01:01:34.807 --> 01:01:35.087]  Dinesh?
[01:01:36.877 --> 01:01:37.437]  Hey, it's Alex.
[01:01:37.537 --> 01:01:38.778]  It's great to be on the show.
[01:01:38.998 --> 01:01:42.320]  And yes, Death of a Nation, it's in a thousand theaters right now.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.820]  It's doing really well.
[01:01:44.461 --> 01:01:47.122]  There's a book of the same title that's in the bookstores.
[01:01:47.142 --> 01:01:59.227]  You know, a lot of people focus on fake news, and what this movie and book deal with are fake scholarship, fake history, fake narratives about America that I debunk in the film.
[01:02:00.408 --> 01:02:03.670]  Well, let me tell you, your other films are excellent, but this one was a whole other level.
[01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:04.250]  It's just, wow.
[01:02:06.087 --> 01:02:11.492]  Well, the left has been flinging these charges of racism and fascism.
[01:02:11.512 --> 01:02:12.753]  They've been doing it at Trump.
[01:02:12.773 --> 01:02:15.056]  They've been doing it at the right more generally.
[01:02:15.476 --> 01:02:28.328]  And all of this is based on a historical claim that fascism is on the right and that racism, even though it might have once been in the Democratic Party, is now the staple of the Republican Party.
[01:02:28.669 --> 01:02:30.991]  Now, this is all pure bogus.
[01:02:31.906 --> 01:02:33.367]  A bogus from start to finish.
[01:02:34.028 --> 01:02:36.070]  And so, but it takes some unpacking.
[01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:43.276]  And so in the movie, we kind of, we take you to Europe, you see the rise of Italian fascism, of German National Socialism.
[01:02:43.596 --> 01:02:47.219]  There you see on the screen, that's the Nazi platform of 1933.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:54.365]  And if you look at the screen, you'll see state control of banks and insurance and healthcare and education.
[01:02:55.526 --> 01:03:00.848]  Well, I mean, it was the liberals that were always for eugenics and sterilizing the blacks and poor whites and everybody.
[01:03:01.149 --> 01:03:02.949]  It was the Republicans that were against it.
[01:03:02.969 --> 01:03:04.850]  If you go to history books, it's right there.
[01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:10.593]  I mean, it was the Democrats, as you know, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, funded by the Rockefellers.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:20.609]  Yeah, in the 1930s, there were deep ties between the Democratic Party and the progressives on this side of the Atlantic and the fascists in Europe.
[01:03:20.909 --> 01:03:23.131]  I mean, Mussolini was praising FDR.
[01:03:23.612 --> 01:03:25.253]  FDR was praising Mussolini.
[01:03:25.834 --> 01:03:30.419]  I quote in the movie, the Nazi newspaper, the Volkischer Beobachter,
[01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:32.160]  Praising the New Deal.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.541]  So all of this, you know, but it's amazing that we're educated people, but we don't know much about it.
[01:03:36.741 --> 01:03:38.062]  It's not been in our textbooks.
[01:03:38.182 --> 01:03:39.502]  It's not on the History Channel.
[01:03:39.763 --> 01:03:41.083]  Certainly not on Wikipedia.
[01:03:41.483 --> 01:03:46.105]  So we are the victims, if you will, the suckers of progressive historiography.
[01:03:46.145 --> 01:03:50.967]  The progressives telling the tale their way, leaving a lot of inconvenient facts out.
[01:03:51.287 --> 01:03:55.929]  But happily, all those inconvenient facts are now in the movie and on the screen.
[01:03:56.209 --> 01:04:00.790]  Well, my grandfather grew up in Dallas, and he was from partly German descendants.
[01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:03.271]  Some of the family still spoke German, and they didn't like Hitler.
[01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:13.394]  He fought in World War II, and they thought it was really weird that they heard Roosevelt saying Hitler was good in the 30s, mid-30s, and the German Bund was saying join it, the liberals were saying join it, and they didn't do it.
[01:04:13.434 --> 01:04:19.316]  My grandfather told me all this when I was a little kid, and my mom would say, your grandfather's a little eccentric, honey.
[01:04:19.996 --> 01:04:24.217]  And my mom's great, but she didn't even, she couldn't believe it, though he was living it.
[01:04:25.464 --> 01:04:35.429]  We have a scene in the film where the senior Nazis, the head of the Justice Department, important people, they're sitting around a table and they're drafting the Nuremberg Laws, which make Jews into second-class citizens.
[01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:40.411]  Now, the Nazis have in their hands the democratic laws of the Jim Crow South.
[01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:45.013]  They are literally crossing out the word black and writing in the word Jew.
[01:04:45.453 --> 01:04:46.435]  So, see what I'm saying.
[01:04:46.475 --> 01:04:48.758]  Not that there was a parallel or similarity.
[01:04:48.998 --> 01:04:51.722]  The Nazis are using the democratic blueprint.
[01:04:51.882 --> 01:04:57.150]  Now, again, someone watching the movie, if they don't know much, might be forgiven of thinking... Stay there, Dinesh.
[01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.991]  This is so powerful.
[01:04:58.011 --> 01:04:59.313]  We'll come back with a trailer straight ahead.
[01:05:01.038 --> 01:05:04.741]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[01:05:49.053 --> 01:05:49.673]  No reviews yet.
[01:05:49.693 --> 01:05:50.314]  We just launched it today.
[01:05:50.334 --> 01:05:52.876]  And then we have, we have Mean Like a Wolverine.
[01:05:52.896 --> 01:05:55.137]  It's not the Marvel comic wimpy Wolverine.
[01:05:55.177 --> 01:05:56.258]  It's the Trump Wolverine.
[01:05:56.538 --> 01:05:58.459]  That's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:58.639 --> 01:06:00.641]  Be sure and get those and find the operation.
[01:06:03.565 --> 01:06:12.497]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.285 --> 01:06:24.610]  Lincoln was elected to unite a country and stop slavery.
[01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:29.735]  Democrats smeared him, went to war against him, assassinated him.
[01:06:30.596 --> 01:06:32.118]  Now, their target is Trump.
[01:06:32.518 --> 01:06:33.720]  America was never good!
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.443]  Slavery genocide and war!
[01:06:36.823 --> 01:06:40.207]  Donald Trump wins the presidency, so help me God.
[01:06:42.341 --> 01:06:44.282]  They say he's killing America.
[01:06:44.722 --> 01:06:47.103]  There will be a vote to impeach.
[01:06:47.143 --> 01:06:48.963]  They say he's a racist.
[01:06:49.023 --> 01:06:50.424]  This is a whitelash.
[01:06:50.564 --> 01:06:51.344]  And a fascist.
[01:06:52.584 --> 01:06:54.665]  Who are the real racists?
[01:06:55.746 --> 01:07:03.028]  Northern Democrats had conspired together with Southern Democrats to take away the fruit of other people's labor.
[01:07:03.188 --> 01:07:05.089]  Who are the real fascists?
[01:07:05.129 --> 01:07:06.769]  Dune is spoken!
[01:07:12.483 --> 01:07:16.585]  Both Mussolini and Hitler set up and ran welfare systems.
[01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:21.388]  This was done by the do-gooders, the liberals, the people who wanted to improve society.
[01:07:21.468 --> 01:07:23.269]  Which party attacks our free speech?
[01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:26.751]  How dare you speak against the people?
[01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:31.174]  Our religious liberty and our personal safety?
[01:07:33.415 --> 01:07:35.916]  A nation dies when its people are not free.
[01:07:37.978 --> 01:07:39.519]  We too must fight for freedom.
[01:07:41.843 --> 01:07:43.504]  Regardless of the price we pay.
[01:07:43.944 --> 01:07:48.327]  An end in terror is preferable to a terror with no end.
[01:07:48.687 --> 01:07:50.148]  The stakes could not be higher.
[01:07:50.369 --> 01:07:53.551]  We're talking about America, the greatest nation on earth.
[01:07:55.412 --> 01:08:02.596]  Lincoln saved America for the first time.
[01:08:04.598 --> 01:08:08.140]  It's now up to us to save America a second time.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.142]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have no stake in Death of a Nation.
[01:08:19.502 --> 01:08:21.023]  Never have when I have Dinesh D'Souza on.
[01:08:21.743 --> 01:08:28.966]  In fact, years ago, we even had one of the advertising groups want to advertise with us, and I said, no, I'll just promote it and play ads.
[01:08:29.307 --> 01:08:32.608]  The network I'm on, they bought some ads from a few years ago with their last film.
[01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:36.870]  I want Dinesh D'Souza on because he's had films that have been number one before.
[01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.731]  This one is already in a thousand theaters doing great.
[01:08:39.151 --> 01:08:42.513]  But I noticed I couldn't go to any of the theaters in the core of Austin, the Alamo Draft House.
[01:08:42.933 --> 01:08:43.854]  None of them are carrying it.
[01:08:44.614 --> 01:08:45.295]  They're blocking it.
[01:08:45.575 --> 01:08:46.516]  There's the accompanying book.
[01:08:46.676 --> 01:08:48.398]  Everyone must see this film.
[01:08:48.438 --> 01:08:57.128]  And I got to tell you, I am quite the research history buff on the Civil War and America's founding and also Andrew Jackson and these periods and World War II.
[01:08:57.148 --> 01:08:59.010]  And this film is extremely accurate.
[01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:03.074]  Very avant-garde in that it's telling a truth that's been hidden.
[01:09:03.174 --> 01:09:05.656]  And as Dinesh said earlier, we just joined us, there's fake news.
[01:09:05.676 --> 01:09:07.217]  What about fake scholars, fake history?
[01:09:07.697 --> 01:09:10.580]  So Dinesh, in the film it gets into the book burning of the Nazis.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.122]  And boy, we see the left and the universities doing it today.
[01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:15.804]  Antifa as their brown shirts.
[01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:18.446]  It's just incredible, the parallels.
[01:09:19.793 --> 01:09:25.175]  Yeah, today they don't have to make a big pyre of books and burn them because they don't assign them.
[01:09:25.475 --> 01:09:27.456]  They don't hire conservative professors.
[01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:31.217]  They try to drive right-wing speakers off the campus.
[01:09:31.237 --> 01:09:35.519]  I mean, look at the way they're trying to make you into a digital non-person.
[01:09:35.999 --> 01:09:43.570]  I mean, you have to go back to Aldous Huxley or Orwell to read these kinds of scenes, except they are in a way playing themselves out in America today.
[01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.372]  It's absolutely outrageous.
[01:09:45.933 --> 01:09:50.860]  And I think anyone who defends civil liberty in the First Amendment, I mean, where's the ACLU on all this, Alex?
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:52.723]  The ACLU should be taking your case.
[01:09:55.185 --> 01:09:57.947]  We've talked to them, and they've said, no, a new time is here.
[01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:02.189]  The decisions have been made to basically selectively repeal the First Amendment.
[01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:09.373]  You've got Senator Murphy in the news saying Infowars is the tip of the iceberg of hate.
[01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:14.136]  He goes on to say, ban them all, and now they're calling for Fox News to be banned, Stephen Crowder.
[01:10:15.657 --> 01:10:18.879]  They're now saying they're going to ban anyone that questions man-made climate change.
[01:10:19.199 --> 01:10:23.602]  I mean, they just picked me as the first domino, and they're testing to see what the Republicans do.
[01:10:24.744 --> 01:10:25.904]  Well, it starts with this.
[01:10:26.004 --> 01:10:31.146]  It's not just a digital banning, it's the cheering for it that I see on social media.
[01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:33.166]  I mean, what a totalitarian mindset.
[01:10:33.426 --> 01:10:42.248]  Now, with my movie, Death of a Nation, and by the way, you go to deathofanationmovie.com, you plug in your zip code, it will tell you, boom, where the movie is playing near you.
[01:10:42.588 --> 01:10:45.309]  But what the left is trying to do there is essentially
[01:10:45.849 --> 01:10:52.494]  Either ignore it, and ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, not one word about the movie, even though it's in a thousand theaters.
[01:10:52.955 --> 01:10:58.159]  The people who do write about it, like the Washington Post, Dinesh says that Hitler is a liberal Democrat.
[01:10:58.299 --> 01:10:59.820]  Well, that's pure nonsense.
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:00.761]  I don't say that.
[01:11:01.121 --> 01:11:02.462]  I would be a kook if I did.
[01:11:02.783 --> 01:11:14.852]  What I do say is that Hitler got some of his bigoted and murderous schemes from American progressives and from the Democratic Party, but they can't accuse me of saying that because that happens to be a historic
[01:11:14.892 --> 01:11:22.217]  Because of the Nuremberg trials, which I've actually read the transcript of and actually watched some of the original film of, their main defense was they got a lot of it from the U.S.
[01:11:23.657 --> 01:11:24.078]  That's right.
[01:11:24.098 --> 01:11:30.522]  The Nazis got progressive eugenic schemes, both for their sterilization laws and their euthanasia laws.
[01:11:30.542 --> 01:11:34.164]  By the way, the euthanasia laws were kind of a dress rehearsal for the Holocaust.
[01:11:34.584 --> 01:11:38.767]  The Nazis also got their Nuremberg laws from the Democratic Jim Crow laws.
[01:11:39.267 --> 01:11:42.248]  And you know, if you watch the movie, you might say, where's Dinesh getting this stuff?
[01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:46.270]  This is why I wrote a book, because it has all the supportive documentation.
[01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:51.733]  In fact, I'm relying on the work of the Yale legal scholar, James Whitman, his book, Hitler's American Model.
[01:11:52.013 --> 01:11:54.534]  This guy has the transcripts of those Nuremberg meetings.
[01:11:54.774 --> 01:11:57.435]  So the left can't question this stuff, and it's so damning.
[01:11:57.715 --> 01:12:03.258]  This is really why they have to say, don't go see the movie, or misdescribe what I'm doing, or try to ignore it altogether.
[01:12:04.025 --> 01:12:07.848]  Well, our gun control laws later got translated, just like they took our laws.
[01:12:08.249 --> 01:12:12.332]  The Democrats ended up taking their laws to pass the 6-8 Gun Control Act.
[01:12:12.372 --> 01:12:13.553]  You cannot make this up!
[01:12:15.395 --> 01:12:25.784]  Now, what happened, I think, Alex, is after World War II, the progressives who were coming to power in the academy, in the media, by the way, they knew that Nazism and fascism were on the left.
[01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:30.508]  They knew that the progressives and Democrats had been in bed with Mussolini, although not
[01:12:31.258 --> 01:12:31.498]  Sure, sure.
[01:12:52.642 --> 01:12:54.462]  And I've noticed a little bit of pressure you've gotten.
[01:12:54.502 --> 01:12:55.683]  They should just black me out as well.
[01:12:55.703 --> 01:12:56.383]  That's their tactic.
[01:12:56.703 --> 01:12:57.543]  Now they just lie about me.
[01:12:57.883 --> 01:12:59.223]  Was, oh, Dinesh is crazy.
[01:12:59.263 --> 01:13:00.083]  He just claims all this.
[01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:01.564]  I read Mein Kampf.
[01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:02.824]  I read Order of the Deathshead.
[01:13:02.944 --> 01:13:04.604]  I read Shearer's Rise of All Third Reich.
[01:13:05.044 --> 01:13:06.124]  I read it from both sides.
[01:13:06.245 --> 01:13:08.945]  And Hitler called himself a socialist.
[01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:11.005]  He believed in it and then called himself a fascist.
[01:13:11.365 --> 01:13:12.386]  And you explained that in the film.
[01:13:12.426 --> 01:13:16.966]  That just means socialism, but using the power of the corporations to basically empower it.
[01:13:17.247 --> 01:13:19.347]  I mean, I read it in Hitler's own words.
[01:13:19.967 --> 01:13:23.114]  The Nazi Party means National Socialist Workers Party!
[01:13:23.134 --> 01:13:24.196]  I mean, my God!
[01:13:25.549 --> 01:13:29.131]  I think you also see this not only with fascism, but with racism.
[01:13:29.691 --> 01:13:33.933]  The deep history of the Democratic Party and its complicity with racism.
[01:13:34.393 --> 01:13:44.697]  The reason I titled this movie Death of a Nation, it's a reference to Birth of a Nation, which was the movie that Woodrow Wilson, a progressive Democrat, showed in the White House to his cabinet.
[01:13:45.037 --> 01:13:48.078]  And the hero of that movie, I kid you not, is the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:13:48.519 --> 01:13:53.961]  So essentially what the progressives were saying, what the title of that movie means, is we don't like the founding
[01:13:54.731 --> 01:13:56.211]  The birth of a nation is right now.
[01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:59.272]  We, the progressives, are starting America all over again.
[01:13:59.292 --> 01:14:04.813]  And the unifying principle, our unifying principle of the Democratic Party is bigotry.
[01:14:05.173 --> 01:14:08.714]  And by the way, you interview a bunch of top Nazis in the U.S.
[01:14:08.834 --> 01:14:11.374]  and they admit that they like birth of a nation.
[01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:13.695]  They don't think you should be here because you're an Indian-American.
[01:14:13.735 --> 01:14:14.635]  It doesn't matter if you contribute.
[01:14:14.655 --> 01:14:15.035]  They're smart.
[01:14:15.055 --> 01:14:15.795]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:14:15.815 --> 01:14:16.955]  If you're smart and hard-working, I love you.
[01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:21.296]  And they admit in the movie, I won't give it all away, that yeah, they're actually Democrats.
[01:14:22.597 --> 01:14:27.599]  It's so eye-opening to see these white nationalists, and one after the other, they have a deep history in the left.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:34.042]  I put on Richard Spencer, the poster boy of white supremacy, and out of his mouth, he goes, I'm a progressive.
[01:14:34.523 --> 01:14:35.403]  I don't like Reagan.
[01:14:35.663 --> 01:14:37.444]  All my favorite presidents are Democrats.
[01:14:37.984 --> 01:14:40.365]  I like... Why do they fetishize the 30s and 40s?
[01:14:40.405 --> 01:14:42.946]  He even is wearing, like, a German-style 1938 outfit.
[01:14:42.966 --> 01:14:43.707]  I mean, what the hell?
[01:14:47.076 --> 01:14:53.521]  When I first saw him, I noticed that he looked kind of antiquated, almost like he was from a different era.
[01:14:53.801 --> 01:15:01.007]  And it's kind of in the interview that it emerges that this guy would fit right in with Woodrow Wilson's progressive racism in the teens of 1920s.
[01:15:01.287 --> 01:15:04.870]  Sure, for those who don't know, Hitler was Time Magazine Man of the Year twice.
[01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:06.872]  They had like gardening magazines.
[01:15:06.892 --> 01:15:07.672]  That's what my grandfather told me.
[01:15:07.692 --> 01:15:08.593]  He said, listen, the U.S.
[01:15:08.653 --> 01:15:09.534]  used to be pro-Hitler.
[01:15:10.654 --> 01:15:14.056]  And it was incredible, and I heard all this, and then later, that's why I got into history books.
[01:15:14.276 --> 01:15:19.419]  Dinesh, we're going to break, but I want to come back, I want to get into the contemporary times of what we're facing that really prove your film.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:29.765]  Because they're everywhere, also on the right saying, de-platform me, ban me, but then once I'm restricted, then they lie even worse and won't let me speak out.
[01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:35.048]  So there's this depersoning, so they can then build this straw man of who I suppose I am.
[01:15:35.068 --> 01:15:36.829]  I want to get your advice on what Trump should do.
[01:15:38.012 --> 01:15:52.302]  As a country, I mean, they've had ten congressional hearings, five in the Senate, five in the House, where I'm the main subject, never showing what I said, lying about me, and saying, ban me off the web, and then as soon as it happened last week, now they're banning everybody else.
[01:15:52.602 --> 01:15:56.365]  What do we do with the former political prisoner, now pardoned by the president, Dinesh D'Souza?
[01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:56.765]  Stay with us.
[01:16:03.965 --> 01:16:05.546]  Hate is such a malleable term.
[01:16:05.646 --> 01:16:09.430]  I mean, you know, hate really means something, an opinion I don't agree with.
[01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:17.316]  Because if you want to get rid of hate speech, I mean, I don't see how anything you've said is anywhere close to what that New York Times columnist you showed earlier saying.
[01:16:17.336 --> 01:16:19.358]  A board member saying whites are subhuman.
[01:16:19.518 --> 01:16:23.021]  Yeah, I mean, how is that not hate speech if there is such a thing?
[01:16:23.061 --> 01:16:25.103]  I just hate that term, hate speech, because it's...
[01:16:25.763 --> 01:16:26.443]  It's not a thing.
[01:16:26.844 --> 01:16:33.826]  What really bothers me about your cases, just globally, is that I don't see anybody from the traditional media backing you up.
[01:16:33.846 --> 01:16:36.067]  And I don't understand how they can look at this.
[01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:41.270]  You know, you questioned the official narrative of what happened at Sandy Hook at some point.
[01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:44.371]  And at the beginning, you said, you made an investigation.
[01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:53.875]  I don't care what happens, anything that happens, when I get an official story from my government, if I'm not questioning it, I want somebody else to question it to make me question it.
[01:16:54.355 --> 01:17:00.477]  Even if it comes around that, hey, maybe we're going to have a rare circumstance where our government doesn't lie to us one bit.
[01:17:00.497 --> 01:17:02.358]  I mean, it might happen once in a while.
[01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:03.678]  Unicorns beg Ziff.
[01:17:03.738 --> 01:17:06.899]  But the point of the media is to be a watchdog.
[01:17:06.939 --> 01:17:07.900]  You're the fourth estate.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.721]  I take a lot of flack for coming on your show and representing you.
[01:17:11.161 --> 01:17:12.761]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[01:17:13.021 --> 01:17:14.562]  And I say, well, you know, tell me.
[01:17:15.322 --> 01:17:25.166]  If you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is, and they'll send me a link to the New York Times, or they'll send me a link to some other article paraphrasing what you said.
[01:17:25.186 --> 01:17:27.588]  And I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[01:17:28.108 --> 01:17:31.529]  And when I go find it, and I say, well, that's not really what was said here.
[01:17:31.649 --> 01:17:33.430]  Well, then there's this back pedal.
[01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:36.792]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[01:17:36.832 --> 01:17:37.732]  I say, wait a sec.
[01:17:37.772 --> 01:17:41.714]  What I want you to think about is how we need a robust marketplace of ideas.
[01:17:42.014 --> 01:17:45.055]  I don't come on your show because I agree with everything you have to say.
[01:17:45.075 --> 01:17:47.415]  You know, before the election, I wrote this article here.
[01:17:48.015 --> 01:17:51.116]  Is the First Amendment safe from Donald Trump on CNN?
[01:17:51.856 --> 01:17:58.258]  And I was concerned because when Trump made his speech that said, we're going to open up the libel law.
[01:17:58.318 --> 01:17:59.018]  I was concerned too.
[01:17:59.038 --> 01:17:59.798]  I don't think he got it.
[01:17:59.998 --> 01:18:03.699]  And you know, and it made me, I mean, I said, wow, that, that got my hackles up.
[01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:04.839]  I mean, I am not.
[01:18:05.419 --> 01:18:08.080]  But now in his own cases, he's, he's using anti-slap.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:09.801]  It's kind of funny, isn't it?
[01:18:09.821 --> 01:18:26.418]  You know, how this is flipped, because now that he got elected, now it is not Donald Trump, but people are anti-Donald Trump, who I should have written this article, I should have written another version of this article saying, is the First Amendment safe from people who have Trump derangement syndrome?
[01:18:27.018 --> 01:18:32.263]  You know, I remember last night we were talking and somebody said, you know, hey, has the right ever really done this?
[01:18:33.266 --> 01:18:38.432]  And I had to correct him, and I said, yes, if you bring the camera down here, heed their rising voices.
[01:18:38.573 --> 01:18:52.209]  New York Times versus Sullivan, the foundational case when it comes to our First Amendment rights, where it was constitutionalized that if you are talking about a public figure, and then expanded to public events,
[01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:56.534]  You must prove defamation over the actual man.
[01:18:56.554 --> 01:18:59.417]  This was the South of the KKK suing everybody to shut down.
[01:18:59.437 --> 01:19:00.178]  That's exactly what it was.
[01:19:00.218 --> 01:19:02.880]  It was exactly what you have going on today.
[01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:10.689]  It was the civil rights movement was invading the South with people who were writing about equality, with people who were trying to
[01:19:11.269 --> 01:19:15.012]  Make this idea of equality and civil rights infected.
[01:19:15.092 --> 01:19:16.713]  You know, they were trying to spread this idea.
[01:19:17.094 --> 01:19:20.276]  And how did these people who wanted to fight against equality deal with it?
[01:19:20.636 --> 01:19:27.521]  They dealt with it through these kind of crazy defamation suits where they were trying to bankrupt anybody who came down there and tried to report.
[01:19:27.702 --> 01:19:31.144]  And now the left is trying to get rid of New York Times versus Sullivan.
[01:19:31.164 --> 01:19:34.427]  They admit to overturn the First Amendment so they can
[01:19:34.827 --> 01:19:36.007]  But I guess it's the Democrats again.
[01:19:36.167 --> 01:19:39.368]  Look, New York Times vs. Sullivan is sacred as far as I'm concerned.
[01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:43.489]  And you know, so far, I haven't seen Donald Trump actually do anything to go against it.
[01:19:43.869 --> 01:19:46.350]  I think his two Supreme Court nominees would support it.
[01:19:46.810 --> 01:19:49.851]  And I can't say the same for the Supreme Court nominees on the left.
[01:19:50.011 --> 01:19:53.232]  So... The Democrats are going after New York Times vs. Sullivan?
[01:19:53.832 --> 01:19:55.593]  At this point, it looks that way, yeah.
[01:19:55.773 --> 01:19:56.093]  We'll be back.
[01:20:03.409 --> 01:20:06.008]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.218 --> 01:20:20.282]  You could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.
[01:20:20.503 --> 01:20:21.924]  What do you mean, biblical?
[01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:24.267]  What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.
[01:20:24.407 --> 01:20:26.169]  Real wrath of God type stuff.
[01:20:26.529 --> 01:20:28.551]  Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
[01:20:28.731 --> 01:20:30.033]  Rivers and seas boiling.
[01:20:30.053 --> 01:20:30.994]  Forty years of darkness.
[01:20:31.054 --> 01:20:32.155]  Earthquakes, volcanoes.
[01:20:32.255 --> 01:20:33.697]  The dead rising from the grave.
[01:20:33.757 --> 01:20:34.918]  Human sacrifice.
[01:20:34.958 --> 01:20:36.620]  Dogs and cats living together.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:37.701]  Mass hysteria!
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:48.427]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:50.249]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:57.515]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:58.933 --> 01:21:04.178]  By the way, I gave that URL out earlier incorrectly, deathofanationmovie.com.
[01:21:04.218 --> 01:21:06.120]  You'll find the book there and more.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:10.404]  There's some books of similar names, but this is the book that goes with the film, deathofanationmovie.com.
[01:21:10.784 --> 01:21:15.269]  Dinesh D'Souza on Twitter, at Dinesh D'Souza, Facebook Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:21:15.609 --> 01:21:18.151]  We were talking during the break about
[01:21:19.025 --> 01:21:33.416]  The left and the Antifa and all of them really proving who they are and just acting so insane and screaming at Candace Owens this last weekend that she's Nazi scum and she's just a black libertarian who's sick of being bullied.
[01:21:33.436 --> 01:21:35.678]  You know, they're trying to call Kanye
[01:21:37.285 --> 01:21:45.750]  West, a Nazi, and then the country's coming back, Trump's unifying people and minorities, have what, in the last year, doubled their numbers of support for Trump?
[01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:49.392]  That's never happened, you know, since the 60s, as you know.
[01:21:49.452 --> 01:21:51.193]  That's got to really panic them.
[01:21:51.234 --> 01:21:53.335]  So, what would you call this moment we're at?
[01:21:53.395 --> 01:21:56.537]  And we see the panicked authoritarian left and the corporations that fund them.
[01:21:56.857 --> 01:22:00.019]  What do you expect they're going to do to try to grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[01:22:01.306 --> 01:22:02.767]  I mean, isn't it ironic?
[01:22:02.807 --> 01:22:09.809]  You have a president whom the left has been calling a white supremacist, and he is doubling the Republican vote.
[01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:12.210]  So this is really crushing to them.
[01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:14.671]  They can't recover from it if it continues this way.
[01:22:14.891 --> 01:22:22.234]  By the way, if Republicans get 30% of the black vote and 40% of the Hispanic vote, the Democratic Party may as well shut its doors.
[01:22:22.615 --> 01:22:24.655]  So this is what is at stake here.
[01:22:25.076 --> 01:22:30.878]  Now, I think that what's going on with this digital stuff, the use of
[01:22:31.638 --> 01:22:34.040]  ...of the government against political opponents.
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:39.203]  It's really amazing to see the way in which the ordinary leftist is now okay with that.
[01:22:39.844 --> 01:22:47.649]  And they'll say things like, well, you know, it's fine to ban Alex Jones because these are private companies and private companies have a right to do whatever they want.
[01:22:48.049 --> 01:22:53.773]  Well, if these same private companies decided, for example, to kick somebody off because they were black, they wouldn't say that.
[01:22:54.133 --> 01:23:00.998]  So it's very obvious that private companies do not have an absolute right to do what they want, at least not as far as the left is concerned.
[01:23:02.259 --> 01:23:12.524]  At least not when the six companies that booted me in the same day are worth 3.1 trillion dollars and are helping suppress people, in the case of Apple and Google, in China.
[01:23:12.544 --> 01:23:17.087]  Have you seen how Apple has moved to China and become state-run as tax-exempt?
[01:23:17.387 --> 01:23:20.428]  And how Google is helping build their internet censor engines?
[01:23:20.749 --> 01:23:22.009]  I mean, this is crazy, Dinesh.
[01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:27.732]  You've got to remember that our civil rights laws do apply to private discrimination.
[01:23:27.752 --> 01:23:30.614]  They cover companies, particularly large companies, and you're not
[01:23:31.354 --> 01:23:35.778]  ...allowed to discriminate against blacks or against women if your company is of a certain size.
[01:23:36.078 --> 01:23:40.101]  Besides, you also have a lot of this fanaticism going on at state-run institutions.
[01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:50.649]  I mean, Berkeley is a state-run institution, and it seems to me that if you have Antifa thugs at a place like Berkeley suppressing people from speaking, what Trump should do is to send in the National Guard.
[01:23:50.809 --> 01:23:51.089]  Why?
[01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:54.152]  Because protecting our First Amendment rights is paramount.
[01:23:57.219 --> 01:23:58.961]  What do you expect to happen in the next three months?
[01:23:59.021 --> 01:24:05.087]  I mean, just the energy of the left, they're losing, they're failing even in special elections, but they are just going crazy.
[01:24:05.367 --> 01:24:06.248]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:24:06.974 --> 01:24:14.395]  Well, this is a case where it's a test case for the right, because either we buckle and go soft, or we go rhino, or we go tough.
[01:24:14.795 --> 01:24:34.999]  Now, remember in Lincoln's time, one of the reasons I put Trump and Lincoln on the cover, in Lincoln's time he was surrounded by rhinos, Republicans in name only, who basically told him that trouble is brewing, you have to give up the Republican platform of 1860, you have to extend the Missouri Compromise line, the slavery line, all the way to the Pacific, leave slavery alone south of that line,
[01:24:35.339 --> 01:24:36.280]  And Lincoln said no.
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:39.083]  He goes, I will suffer death before I agree to that.
[01:24:39.563 --> 01:24:40.585]  I campaigned on this.
[01:24:40.645 --> 01:24:43.427]  The American people ratified it through an electoral majority.
[01:24:43.488 --> 01:24:44.328]  And isn't it crazy?
[01:24:44.388 --> 01:24:45.309]  He did suffer death.
[01:24:45.389 --> 01:24:46.350]  He did suffer death.
[01:24:46.751 --> 01:24:50.114]  And he did suffer death eventually, but he was he was still tough.
[01:24:50.515 --> 01:24:54.979]  And what we need from Trump here is not just wisdom, but we need a certain amount of courage.
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.262]  And the big question is, will the Republicans
[01:24:57.722 --> 01:25:01.225]  Stand up and defend liberal, classically liberal principles.
[01:25:01.245 --> 01:25:02.086]  No, no, I agree.
[01:25:02.426 --> 01:25:06.409]  And the parallels between Trump and Lincoln in history are incredible.
[01:25:06.449 --> 01:25:08.791]  History is repeating again, or at least rhyming.
[01:25:09.292 --> 01:25:10.473]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:25:10.493 --> 01:25:14.576]  Because he came out and said to Twitter, your shadow banning looks like it's illegal.
[01:25:14.956 --> 01:25:16.318]  They are the only one not to ban me.
[01:25:16.718 --> 01:25:21.482]  Showing if Republicans put pressure on tech not to censor, they'll back off.
[01:25:21.922 --> 01:25:25.005]  But because they're not signaling that, they're all censoring and purging.
[01:25:26.344 --> 01:25:26.764]  Exactly.
[01:25:26.784 --> 01:25:34.268]  I would like to see a more resolute effort across the board, not just Trump, but also the Republican Congress, begin hearings into all this stuff.
[01:25:34.308 --> 01:25:36.850]  I mean, censorship is an issue that we as Americans should agree.
[01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:39.831]  This is the bedrock foundation of our democracy.
[01:25:39.891 --> 01:25:43.013]  So if we can't stand up for the First Amendment, what can we stand up for?
[01:25:44.091 --> 01:25:44.291]  I agree.
[01:25:44.311 --> 01:25:47.692]  We've got three minutes left, and I want to just give you the floor about other key points about the film.
[01:25:48.032 --> 01:25:51.813]  Obviously, I don't want to give the film away, but seriously, all your children need to see it.
[01:25:52.433 --> 01:25:55.314]  It's PG-13 or whatever, but I'd take 10-year-olds to this.
[01:25:55.414 --> 01:25:56.214]  Old people need to see it.
[01:25:56.534 --> 01:25:58.674]  Black, white, you need to know the real history.
[01:25:59.014 --> 01:26:00.155]  They're scared of this film.
[01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:05.256]  And the fact that at the end, there's a litmus test that if you expose Soros and his Nazi ties,
[01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:07.397]  That's why they've told me they're coming after me.
[01:26:07.437 --> 01:26:16.464]  So the fact that you did that, I gotta tell you, Dinesh, you were already in my eyes in A+, on Ace of Spades, my friend, but you went to royal flush level with what you did at the end of the movie.
[01:26:16.484 --> 01:26:18.406]  So congratulations on that, because he will come after you.
[01:26:19.186 --> 01:26:28.434]  Well, the thing about Soros to remember is that, you know, when he's asked about his Nazi collaboration, and by collaboration here we mean at the age of 14, Soros is going around with another guy.
[01:26:28.474 --> 01:26:31.796]  They're literally the two of them confiscating the property of Jews.
[01:26:31.856 --> 01:26:33.598]  And Soros admits that he was part of that.
[01:26:33.858 --> 01:26:35.199]  He says he didn't directly do it.
[01:26:35.439 --> 01:26:38.581]  But he admits he was there and in that sense he was a participant.
[01:26:38.901 --> 01:26:43.103]  Now, when he's asked, do you feel any guilt as an adult now about it?
[01:26:43.423 --> 01:26:47.005]  He goes, no, because I didn't invent Nazi confiscation policies.
[01:26:47.025 --> 01:26:48.045]  They were there anyway.
[01:26:48.345 --> 01:26:49.666]  It was going to happen anyway.
[01:26:49.966 --> 01:26:59.071]  And in the movie we showed that that was basically what the Nazi doctor Mengele said when he was accused of doing Nazi atrocities.
[01:26:59.111 --> 01:26:59.851]  He goes, wait a minute.
[01:27:00.231 --> 01:27:01.851]  I didn't invent the concentration camp.
[01:27:01.891 --> 01:27:03.372]  Those people were going to die anyway.
[01:27:03.632 --> 01:27:07.993]  So if I was going to do my own macabre experiments on them, I wasn't changing the outcome.
[01:27:08.213 --> 01:27:10.093]  And I was just following orders.
[01:27:10.194 --> 01:27:12.274]  It's such a weird sociopathic out.
[01:27:13.954 --> 01:27:18.055]  And to realize that this guy today is presenting himself as an anti-fascist.
[01:27:18.095 --> 01:27:20.356]  In fact, he's one of the funders of Antifa.
[01:27:20.456 --> 01:27:22.236]  I mean, the irony could not be deeper.
[01:27:22.497 --> 01:27:28.158]  If anyone associated with Trump had Soros' background, can you imagine the national uproar?
[01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:33.061]  Well, I read stuff he wrote in the 70s where he thought he was God and stuff.
[01:27:33.121 --> 01:27:45.391]  I mean, the guy, seriously, is just... I don't know what his issue is, but as you said, he's one of the main funders of the left in America, and I've just seen the left degenerate into what they are now.
[01:27:45.931 --> 01:27:48.333]  We need to make Death of a Nation as big as your other films.
[01:27:48.393 --> 01:27:49.394]  It's already a big success.
[01:27:49.794 --> 01:27:55.499]  Again, everybody needs to take their family out to see it, because then it can go from, what, a thousand theaters, even more, Dinesh?
[01:27:56.519 --> 01:27:59.561]  Yes, and it'll also get a wider distribution in the DVD.
[01:27:59.581 --> 01:28:05.405]  I mean, this could be a film that really educates and motivates people leading up to the midterm election.
[01:28:05.465 --> 01:28:10.428]  So just go to deathofanationmovie.com, put in your zip code, boom, it'll tell you where it's playing.
[01:28:10.728 --> 01:28:12.249]  Go see it with your family and friends.
[01:28:12.429 --> 01:28:13.250]  I'd appreciate it.
[01:28:13.570 --> 01:28:18.073]  And you're putting fuel in my rocket to get this message out much more widely and powerfully.
[01:28:18.697 --> 01:28:19.257]  Well, exactly.
[01:28:19.277 --> 01:28:23.699]  When I was there, the theater was almost completely full, but it was a lot of older folks, some young people.
[01:28:23.759 --> 01:28:25.340]  We need a lot of young people there.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:31.482]  This film really is powerful, and the average leftist, when they see this, I think will wake up and maybe come out of their programming.
[01:28:31.782 --> 01:28:34.743]  Dinesh D'Souza, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:28:34.823 --> 01:28:39.165]  DeathOfANationMovie.com, and we'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[01:28:39.185 --> 01:28:39.585]  God bless.
[01:28:41.126 --> 01:28:41.426]  Bye-bye.
[01:28:42.276 --> 01:28:46.698]  Alright, we'll be back in the studio ladies and gentlemen with the heroes of Benghazi.
[01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:53.182]  Benghazi then went public about how they were ordered to stand down despite Hillary's threats.
[01:28:53.202 --> 01:28:54.422]  That's coming up straight ahead.
[01:29:02.006 --> 01:29:03.707]  What are champions made of?
[01:29:05.428 --> 01:29:06.549]  Here's a man who can show you.

[01:29:49.569 --> 01:29:52.170]  I've got a big announcement here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:53.611]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[01:29:53.671 --> 01:29:53.931]  You saw
[01:30:09.282 --> 01:30:17.745]  Dan Rather come out and, you know, demonize me and attack what we're doing here at InfoWars and call us fake news.
[01:30:17.785 --> 01:30:19.106]  But, you know, he's the fake news.
[01:30:19.226 --> 01:30:25.108]  And he also recently came out and said that Trump is mean like a wolverine.
[01:30:25.208 --> 01:30:26.869]  So earlier this week I said, hey,
[01:30:27.529 --> 01:30:30.350]  Let's put out Trump as a Wolverine.
[01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:33.730]  MeanLikeAWolverineInfoWars.com.
[01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:35.450]  Beautiful new red shirt.
[01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:37.751]  Incredible job with the graphics crew.
[01:30:37.811 --> 01:30:39.911]  They are amazing.
[01:30:39.931 --> 01:30:39.911]  1995.
[01:30:40.091 --> 01:30:41.051]  High quality shirt.
[01:30:41.171 --> 01:30:43.032]  It's being printed right now.
[01:30:43.152 --> 01:30:44.632]  They'll be shipping out next week.
[01:30:45.132 --> 01:30:46.272]  Get your order in.
[01:30:46.352 --> 01:30:47.513]  This is a limited edition.
[01:30:47.593 --> 01:30:49.853]  This needs to be the new viral shirt.
[01:30:49.913 --> 01:30:51.473]  Now, I think I got another idea today.
[01:30:51.573 --> 01:30:54.574]  We've got printing right here in Texas now, so we can get this by next week as well.
[01:30:55.154 --> 01:31:00.515]  I just put in a giant order because I saw Walmart boycott launched over Impeach45 clothing.
[01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:02.155]  Don't boycott Walmart over that.
[01:31:02.315 --> 01:31:03.216]  Just say Walmart.
[01:31:03.916 --> 01:31:05.236]  I don't care if they copy our shirt.
[01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:06.996]  Put out a Reelect45.
[01:31:08.177 --> 01:31:09.817]  You know, let's engage in that.
[01:31:09.837 --> 01:31:11.497]  So they've got their Impeach45.
[01:31:11.517 --> 01:31:13.318]  You go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:13.358 --> 01:31:19.039]  We have Reelect45 with an American flag very triggering on the right arm and on the back.
[01:31:19.479 --> 01:31:20.619]  Infowars.com.
[01:31:21.359 --> 01:31:23.960]  I am the resistance.
[01:31:25.295 --> 01:31:27.319]  I am the resistance.
[01:31:28.622 --> 01:31:30.426]  This, I mean, these shirts have just been hitting me.
[01:31:30.486 --> 01:31:31.869]  And I knew Hillary for President.
[01:31:32.691 --> 01:31:35.697]  I saw a handmade sign in a yard.
[01:31:37.199 --> 01:31:40.040]  About, you know, like three years before the election.
[01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:41.340]  They knew she'd run.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.501]  And then I remember thinking, or two years before, I thought, we've got to do that.
[01:31:44.581 --> 01:31:48.102]  And we went to the RNC, and a third of the people were wearing it.
[01:31:48.162 --> 01:31:48.923]  It was The Chance.
[01:31:50.363 --> 01:31:52.664]  We had planes flying around saying it behind them.
[01:31:52.704 --> 01:31:53.424]  It was incredible.
[01:31:53.444 --> 01:31:54.204]  It was a magic moment.
[01:31:54.744 --> 01:31:56.525]  And I know when something's going to be a hit.
[01:31:57.205 --> 01:32:03.207]  So they've got their Impeach 45, Re-elect 45, baseball shirt style, white, blue, and red.
[01:32:03.507 --> 01:32:04.107]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:32:04.307 --> 01:32:06.368]  And then black on white, I am the resistance.
[01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:09.129]  It's an awesome shirt.
[01:32:09.409 --> 01:32:09.129]  $19.95.
[01:32:09.469 --> 01:32:11.230]  High quality fabric.
[01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:12.091]  Made right here in America.
[01:32:12.151 --> 01:32:12.851]  Printed in America.
[01:32:12.871 --> 01:32:15.832]  So, you know, it's costing us six, seven bucks to do that in America.
[01:32:15.852 --> 01:32:17.113]  We do it for three bucks in Mexico.
[01:32:17.513 --> 01:32:18.114]  So it's there.
[01:32:18.534 --> 01:32:19.534]  Help fund the operation.
[01:32:19.614 --> 01:32:20.355]  Reelect45.
[01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:22.196]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:22.556 --> 01:32:23.216]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:23.256 --> 01:32:23.376]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:24.637]  And mean like a wolverine.
[01:32:29.399 --> 01:32:32.562]  These shirts are both so good, I don't know which one's gonna be a best-seller.
[01:32:32.602 --> 01:32:35.204]  And right through the 4th of July, free shipping across the store.
[01:32:35.224 --> 01:32:38.467]  50% off Rainforest, which we just went out and said, what are the top new trophies?
[01:32:38.527 --> 01:32:38.987]  Okay, here they are.
[01:32:39.367 --> 01:32:40.348]  Well, why is it 60 bucks?
[01:32:40.368 --> 01:32:41.689]  There's like $10 a product in this.
[01:32:42.330 --> 01:32:44.031]  I'll just make it even stronger, sell it for $30.
[01:32:44.691 --> 01:32:45.692]  When it's discounted, it's like $19.95.
[01:32:45.792 --> 01:32:48.374]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:32:48.755 --> 01:32:50.576]  Infoworkstore.com, with free shipping.
[01:32:50.816 --> 01:32:51.617]  You can't beat that.
[01:32:51.937 --> 01:32:56.441]  Throughout this entire July 4th, 2nd American Revolution, Super Sale!
[01:33:04.426 --> 01:33:07.148]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.551 --> 01:33:18.936]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:33:19.416 --> 01:33:27.061]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:33:27.341 --> 01:33:29.443]  As president, I will make it clear.
[01:33:30.303 --> 01:33:35.046]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:33:35.626 --> 01:33:40.990]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:44.332]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[01:33:44.412 --> 01:33:47.233]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:33:47.454 --> 01:33:50.015]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:33:52.398 --> 01:33:54.820]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:58.244]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:33:58.464 --> 01:34:06.352]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:34:08.263 --> 01:34:08.743]  The U.S.
[01:34:08.783 --> 01:34:12.405]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[01:34:12.765 --> 01:34:20.390]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:23.091]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:27.313]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[01:34:27.773 --> 01:34:31.836]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:34:31.856 --> 01:34:34.057]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:34:37.921 --> 01:34:42.318]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:10.770]  Well, Trump's got world peace going on in North Korea.
[01:35:10.930 --> 01:35:13.170]  China's been screwing us over, so they fired at U.S.
[01:35:13.230 --> 01:35:16.251]  ships today in a warning so they can get out of the South China Sea.
[01:35:16.351 --> 01:35:21.473]  So we hope nuclear war doesn't happen, but I'd bet on humanity.
[01:35:21.913 --> 01:35:24.053]  John Teigen is here with us.
[01:35:24.093 --> 01:35:25.274]  Johnteigen.com.
[01:35:25.574 --> 01:35:27.935]  That's T-I-E-G-E-N.com.
[01:35:28.295 --> 01:35:29.335]  On Twitter, John Teigen.
[01:35:29.855 --> 01:35:32.016]  And he's one of the heroes of Benghazi.
[01:35:32.915 --> 01:35:49.114]  But expanding on that, then he's a hero because these guys went on television years after Hillary said they were liars and that nobody ordered her to stand down, even though there were thousands of people reportedly watching the surveillance footage from the drones, knowing that that was the truth, and then told the truth to expose her lies.
[01:35:49.174 --> 01:35:51.697]  And then the Pentagon turned against Obama and Hillary.
[01:35:52.762 --> 01:35:54.823]  The intelligence agencies learned about what happened.
[01:35:54.843 --> 01:36:04.809]  We were talking during the break and he was agreeing that that was a real turning point for America in our military and intelligence agencies really waking up to just how, I don't know, traitorous?
[01:36:04.829 --> 01:36:07.351]  I mean, what would you call the people that were involved in that stand-up?
[01:36:08.492 --> 01:36:09.052]  Good to have you here.
[01:36:09.132 --> 01:36:09.892]  Appreciate you.
[01:36:09.912 --> 01:36:10.593]  Thanks for having me, man.
[01:36:10.613 --> 01:36:12.514]  Good to have you.
[01:36:12.534 --> 01:36:14.795]  Just a complete disgrace is what I would say.
[01:36:16.812 --> 01:36:21.635]  You know, the fact that, you know, again, Bob gave him the stand down order that night, the CIA base chief.
[01:36:22.355 --> 01:36:26.217]  I don't think he realized really the assets that he had or capabilities that he had.
[01:36:26.297 --> 01:36:31.820]  And, you know, if we'd have left when we wanted to leave immediately, Ambassador Stephen and Sean Smith would still be alive today.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.622]  Because, I mean, it took them over 15 minutes to start the buildings on fire.
[01:36:35.642 --> 01:36:36.362]  We would have been there.
[01:36:36.382 --> 01:36:37.623]  They'd have to engage with us.
[01:36:37.663 --> 01:36:39.964]  They wouldn't be able to just roam around the property and do what they wanted.
[01:36:40.724 --> 01:36:45.066]  So... Why do you think Hillary and them ordered the stand down and then lied about it?
[01:36:45.147 --> 01:36:45.327]  Why?
[01:36:47.971 --> 01:36:49.472]  It was during the election time.
[01:36:50.092 --> 01:36:53.333]  They're more worried about their political career than the people on the ground.
[01:36:53.573 --> 01:36:58.954]  I mean, it's been shown over and over again that politicians really, truly don't care about the American people.
[01:36:58.974 --> 01:37:00.455]  They care about themselves and their career.
[01:37:01.775 --> 01:37:07.317]  I just can't get the instinct, even if you have the forces there, especially to just cut people loose and lie about it.
[01:37:11.781 --> 01:37:17.982]  I don't think she really knew the mindset of the local Libyans themselves, because they liked us.
[01:37:18.363 --> 01:37:22.623]  I mean, I've never been in a Muslim country where they would come and shake your hand and say it's an honor to meet an American.
[01:37:22.643 --> 01:37:30.525]  It's the only place where they've bought our food, they've bought our coffee, and they actually genuinely wanted to talk to us and just liked us.
[01:37:30.585 --> 01:37:33.306]  I mean, they'd walk across the street just to introduce themselves to us.
[01:37:34.667 --> 01:37:37.269]  And I just don't think she really knew the people that were there.
[01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:42.855]  If they were sending the military force to help out the ambassador and us, I don't think they would have batted an eye at it.
[01:37:43.375 --> 01:37:45.718]  I mean, for one, you're dealing with a lawless country.
[01:37:45.738 --> 01:37:49.742]  It wasn't like they had a really organized central government.
[01:37:50.482 --> 01:37:52.244]  Well, I wasn't there like you, but I've studied it.
[01:37:52.704 --> 01:37:57.929]  Gaddafi was a bad guy before, but he came in about eight years before, invested all his money in the West, thought Obama was his buddy.
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:37:59.500]  Get all this.
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:04.122]  And so a lot of that was he was trying to build up Africa and thought he was buddies with the U.S.
[01:38:04.182 --> 01:38:14.546]  And then some of the other leftist groups were bringing in Al Qaeda forces out of Egypt, out of other countries, massing them in Benghazi and preparing for what was coming up.
[01:38:15.106 --> 01:38:17.327]  And so that's really why that was there.
[01:38:17.367 --> 01:38:19.268]  They didn't want a skirmish with U.S.
[01:38:19.308 --> 01:38:23.850]  forces or some folks getting wiped out to get in the way of their planned takedown completely of Libya.
[01:38:25.259 --> 01:38:29.702]  Yeah, I mean, again, it wasn't the Libyans that attacked, that really attacked us.
[01:38:29.762 --> 01:38:35.726]  It was outside foreign attackers that, you know, Antara Sharia wasn't, I mean, I'm pretty sure some Libyans that were inside the group.
[01:38:35.806 --> 01:38:37.067]  Did you ever learn where they'd come in from?
[01:38:37.107 --> 01:38:38.348]  I'd heard Egypt and other areas.
[01:38:38.548 --> 01:38:44.612]  Yeah, they've come from, there's Egyptian, there's Saudi, I think there's a couple Uzbekistanis in there.
[01:38:44.992 --> 01:38:46.793]  So, I mean, they're all over.
[01:38:47.754 --> 01:38:49.715]  Well, just give it the 35,000 foot view.
[01:38:50.616 --> 01:38:53.298]  And, of course, there's an amazing film, 13 hours all about it.
[01:38:54.838 --> 01:39:01.342]  And looking at that from my perspective, talking to people in the military and Congress, Benghazi was a turning point against Hillary and Obama.
[01:39:01.722 --> 01:39:08.766]  And the fact that they couldn't get you guys to shut up, that you went on TV and said, no, they're lying, not us, that I think that was the final breaking point.
[01:39:09.547 --> 01:39:11.748]  I think you guys helped get Trump elected.
[01:39:12.008 --> 01:39:12.749]  I believe so, too.
[01:39:12.809 --> 01:39:22.335]  I definitely, we, you know, during the book, Tory ran into quite a few people that are Democrats, and they're saying, because you guys came out and told it, and still standing up to it, that's the reason why we're voting for Trump.
[01:39:23.455 --> 01:39:23.756]  It was.
[01:39:23.816 --> 01:39:27.899]  It was a huge turning point and a big factor for her not getting elected.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:30.961]  Like she kept saying, what difference did it make?
[01:39:30.982 --> 01:39:31.762]  Well, now she knows.
[01:39:33.383 --> 01:39:47.875]  But if I was even a sociopath, a Machiavelli, if an ambassador is being overrun in a country and you've already got, like you said, a bunch of special operations and a plane loaded 100 miles away ready to go take them out, why wouldn't you be the hero and knock their ass out?
[01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:52.519]  It's like this anti-American instinct to just cut some people off like you're nothing.
[01:39:54.562 --> 01:39:55.402]  Yeah, I would like to know that.
[01:39:55.463 --> 01:40:03.046]  I mean, I'd like to get inside their head and ask them why, why wouldn't you, you know, what the military fast company, they're, they changed out of uniform three times.
[01:40:03.607 --> 01:40:04.967]  Why are you even worried about what they're wearing?
[01:40:05.127 --> 01:40:05.788]  Just get them there.
[01:40:05.988 --> 01:40:11.791]  Well, without getting into secret classified stuff, I've been told by other Green Berets and stuff, how many, one guy was in the plane loaded up.
[01:40:12.431 --> 01:40:13.992]  I mean, how many groups were ready to come in there?
[01:40:15.902 --> 01:40:25.226]  I believe that I know of, there was one that broke ground, I mean they were in the air, and there was actually one that was on the ground and got turned around.
[01:40:25.666 --> 01:40:31.848]  So there's two units that I know of that were there that night and made it that night before everything was even over and he got told to turn around.
[01:40:32.989 --> 01:40:40.232]  So that's like there's a storm, you run off in a river, you call on your cell phone to the fire department, come save me, they can come pull up and get you, we just, sorry, can't do it.
[01:40:40.632 --> 01:40:43.713]  Yeah, pretty much they're like on the shoreline just watching you and then they walk away.
[01:40:45.427 --> 01:40:47.969]  Man, again, it wasn't the military unit's fault, it's the leadership's.
[01:40:47.989 --> 01:40:48.469]  No, I understand.
[01:40:48.489 --> 01:40:49.010]  They were oiled.
[01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:51.051]  What are you gonna do when you're in a plane?
[01:40:51.071 --> 01:40:51.632]  Have a mutiny?
[01:40:51.672 --> 01:40:53.193]  Plus, they don't really know what the situation is.
[01:40:53.213 --> 01:40:53.953]  They're just being told.
[01:40:53.973 --> 01:40:55.855]  Sure, you're loaded on a plane, you're sitting there, you don't know.
[01:40:55.875 --> 01:40:57.336]  The pilots don't know.
[01:40:57.776 --> 01:41:01.118]  So, again, the pilots and a lot of guys, they knew what was happening.
[01:41:01.499 --> 01:41:06.042]  They probably did what General Ham did and that Admiral on the fleet did, where they both got relieved.
[01:41:06.102 --> 01:41:06.983]  Said, no, we're gonna go help.
[01:41:07.813 --> 01:41:09.354]  You know, they both got relieved.
[01:41:09.414 --> 01:41:12.275]  And that's the next thing, is that it wasn't a mess-up.
[01:41:12.335 --> 01:41:13.235]  It goes up the chain.
[01:41:13.275 --> 01:41:15.876]  People are being relieved because they won't stand down.
[01:41:16.337 --> 01:41:17.377]  Why was it so important?
[01:41:17.417 --> 01:41:24.160]  I was told by Colonel Schaefer a week after it happened, he got in a lot of trouble, but it later came to be true, that they wanted those weapons to be shipped to Syria, and that's why they were standing down.
[01:41:25.117 --> 01:41:28.319]  Yeah, the weapon things, I never got involved with the weapon portion of it.
[01:41:28.439 --> 01:41:34.284]  I mean, you sit in some of the meetings, but, you know, they speak Arabic and I don't understand Arabic, so whatever they were talking about.
[01:41:35.024 --> 01:41:38.387]  I know, like, the biggest thing was the Stinger missiles, but we do that everywhere.
[01:41:38.427 --> 01:41:41.649]  We go collect them as much as we can so they can't take down commercial airliners.
[01:41:42.570 --> 01:41:46.273]  But as for the small arm stuff, I never saw any of that, personally.
[01:41:47.622 --> 01:41:48.603]  What a crazy time.
[01:41:49.064 --> 01:41:56.574]  You know, looking at Hillary Clinton, who probably watches the show sometimes, what's your views on Hillary and Obama just in hindsight now?
[01:41:58.757 --> 01:42:03.182]  You know, they're just extremely, she's extremely untrustworthy.
[01:42:03.222 --> 01:42:04.945]  I mean, she lies about and
[01:42:05.665 --> 01:42:13.892]  Just the fact she can lie to the family members at their receiving of their remains coming home and telling them, say, oh, we're going to get this guy over this video.
[01:42:13.912 --> 01:42:22.538]  You know, I've talked to Rowan's mom, you know, I've talked to a lot of the family members and they say the exact same thing that they right there at they lied to him right then and there about this video.
[01:42:22.558 --> 01:42:24.740]  They're going to get the guy and, you know,
[01:42:25.686 --> 01:42:29.090]  How could you even sit there and... You know for a fact that it wasn't.
[01:42:29.290 --> 01:42:30.372]  They got video footage.
[01:42:30.412 --> 01:42:32.073]  They got the security footage from the U.S.
[01:42:32.113 --> 01:42:32.594]  Consulate.
[01:42:32.694 --> 01:42:34.917]  If it was a protest, release the video.
[01:42:34.937 --> 01:42:37.920]  Well sure, they made it about YouTube so they could censor it.
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:38.120]  Yeah.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:40.123]  Oh, some guy criticized Mohammed.
[01:42:40.483 --> 01:42:41.324]  Had nothing to do with it.
[01:42:42.285 --> 01:42:43.326]  We're to come back then.
[01:42:44.467 --> 01:42:48.451]  And get into just all the different issues involved and the most important points you want to make.
[01:42:48.471 --> 01:42:51.033]  I kind of like the speech you're going to be giving out at Fast Drop this weekend.
[01:42:51.193 --> 01:42:56.418]  It's sold out, overflow crowd, but we're going to talk about some of the other speaking engagements you're doing and more.

[01:45:01.058 --> 01:45:04.181]  The President of the United States is racist.
[01:45:04.881 --> 01:45:05.642]  He's a punk.
[01:45:06.603 --> 01:45:07.363]  He's a dog.
[01:45:08.164 --> 01:45:08.845]  He's a pig.
[01:45:09.145 --> 01:45:10.286]  He can suck my p***.
[01:45:10.746 --> 01:45:13.208]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[01:45:13.328 --> 01:45:17.832]  Kiss my motherf***ing ass, you bitch, punk, p*** sucker.
[01:45:17.872 --> 01:45:19.293]  The President of the United States
[01:45:20.274 --> 01:45:21.376]  is a weak man.
[01:45:21.576 --> 01:45:23.719]  He's not only unfit to be president.
[01:45:23.819 --> 01:45:29.406]  In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage, he's unfit to be human.
[01:45:29.486 --> 01:45:33.111]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[01:45:41.018 --> 01:45:45.183]  Donald J. Trump is president of the United States.
[01:46:00.549 --> 01:46:04.132]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:46:04.533 --> 01:46:06.975]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.

[01:47:03.832 --> 01:47:06.515]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:11.693 --> 01:47:12.716]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:12.856 --> 01:47:14.741]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.073 --> 01:47:25.877]  Benghazi Hero, John Teigen, johnteigen.com.
[01:47:26.658 --> 01:47:28.199]  Teigen, Teigen, I just mispronounced.
[01:47:28.219 --> 01:47:28.659]  It's Teigen.
[01:47:28.799 --> 01:47:29.400]  I got it right.
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:45.915]  But I've watched the film, I tell you, I don't usually like war movies, I take that stuff real serious, but talking to folks that were there, like, like, you know, your good buddy, Chris Tonto-Piranto and others, they said it was a pretty accurate film and you watch that thing and it's just like, it's just crazy.
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:54.668]  Yeah, I mean, they did a really good job getting, you know, got everybody really involved, sucked everybody in, and they honored the four guys.
[01:47:54.828 --> 01:47:56.169]  I mean, they did a really good job with the movie.
[01:47:56.810 --> 01:48:01.554]  I mean, nothing can be 100% accurate, but I mean, like, if you were actually in that, it seems like you'd have...
[01:48:02.315 --> 01:48:03.215]  At least flashbacks.
[01:48:03.295 --> 01:48:04.635]  I've had bad things happen in my life.
[01:48:04.975 --> 01:48:06.056]  I don't like remembering them.
[01:48:06.516 --> 01:48:13.717]  But I mean, what was it like going in a big screen theater and watching something with a $200, $300 million budget, whatever it was, about you?
[01:48:14.837 --> 01:48:17.918]  It was very, very weird.
[01:48:18.798 --> 01:48:23.659]  I mean, like you said, we walked on the set and they had the annex set up.
[01:48:23.879 --> 01:48:27.779]  And literally when we walked to that front gate, it felt like we were right there at the annex in Benghazi.
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:30.000]  That's how, I mean, it was really, really close.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:32.041]  How'd they pull that off?
[01:48:32.061 --> 01:48:32.961]  Satellite images?
[01:48:34.062 --> 01:48:34.682]  Yeah, and me.
[01:48:34.942 --> 01:48:36.503]  I had them change a lot of things.
[01:48:36.703 --> 01:48:38.164]  You were an advisor on that.
[01:48:38.284 --> 01:48:39.825]  Michael Bay kind of complained a little bit.
[01:48:39.845 --> 01:48:42.966]  It cost him like another $100,000 to move a couple light bulbs.
[01:48:43.126 --> 01:48:46.128]  But yeah, they tried to get as accurate as they could.
[01:48:46.328 --> 01:48:51.471]  The concept wasn't too far off, but they did a really good job.
[01:48:52.662 --> 01:48:55.904]  I don't want to bring myself into the story, but it's one of the top stories in the country the last few weeks.
[01:48:55.924 --> 01:49:03.809]  They're de-platforming us, lying about what we've said, and then now they go, oh, we took you off YouTube, we banned you streaming, someone else did it.
[01:49:03.849 --> 01:49:07.452]  Well, now they're saying, Jones is back on Facebook denying the ban.
[01:49:07.492 --> 01:49:08.473]  So I knew this was coming next.
[01:49:09.113 --> 01:49:15.377]  Now they don't want other people grabbing our feeds or uploading our videos, and they're now suppressing them.
[01:49:15.737 --> 01:49:19.140]  So this is true de-platforming, where they're making me this un-person.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.202]  And I know, because I talked to folks that were involved,
[01:49:22.962 --> 01:49:36.887]  I don't know how much this can get into, but the threats to families, to you guys, in the year or two before you finally went public, and then I remember talking to a few guys off record and one on record, they said, look, it was actually the threats and intimidation is what made us finally go public.
[01:49:36.907 --> 01:49:37.827]  I mean, can you speak to that?
[01:49:38.567 --> 01:49:40.688]  I mean, for us directly,
[01:49:41.826 --> 01:49:45.609]  I mean, they can't really threaten us too much because they'd be sending guys like us for guys like us.
[01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:49.433]  So threatening us ain't going to do too much.
[01:49:49.453 --> 01:49:57.179]  But I've heard a couple of the other guys that said, you know, if you come out, obviously you're going to get fired, this and that, there's going to be a lot of pushback.
[01:50:00.782 --> 01:50:01.802]  Just like the stand-down order.
[01:50:01.863 --> 01:50:04.364]  They sit there telling us that we're lying about the stand-down order.
[01:50:04.544 --> 01:50:07.425]  But everything else that we ever talked about, you know, it was true.
[01:50:07.445 --> 01:50:09.886]  Except for this one little incident with the stand-down order.
[01:50:10.386 --> 01:50:13.188]  You know, I don't know what their big problem is.
[01:50:13.428 --> 01:50:14.728]  What they're trying to hide.
[01:50:14.769 --> 01:50:19.311]  And the longer the firefight got, the more the stand-down got exposed.
[01:50:20.472 --> 01:50:20.892]  Pretty much.
[01:50:20.952 --> 01:50:24.053]  I mean, we're there in direct contact for eight hours.
[01:50:24.193 --> 01:50:25.474]  I mean, direct, direct contact.
[01:50:26.274 --> 01:50:31.596]  And, you know, they got military bases that can send jets that are 30 minutes away.
[01:50:31.836 --> 01:50:36.478]  I mean, you got the Italian, you got Souda Bay that's right there, or Crete.
[01:50:36.958 --> 01:50:39.479]  You know, there's an Air Force base that's right there.
[01:50:39.499 --> 01:50:41.099]  Why can't you send assets from there?
[01:50:41.259 --> 01:50:49.182]  Describe the standout without getting into any secret codes or anything, but as much as you can say, like, what it was like, how many hours in, what's happening, you finally get told, stand out.
[01:50:49.883 --> 01:50:53.990]  It was within 15 minutes, 20 minutes of us getting ready to leave.
[01:50:54.471 --> 01:51:01.383]  So it happened fairly quickly and it was Bob, the chief of base, you know, I got out of the vehicle and you know, the longer you give the enemy
[01:51:03.396 --> 01:51:09.357]  The chance to dig in, they're going to dig in, which is going to make it a lot harder for us to push them out, which is going to make our lives in a lot more danger.
[01:51:09.958 --> 01:51:10.858]  So that's what I'm thinking.
[01:51:10.878 --> 01:51:15.499]  So I get out of the car, you know, I yell at the chief and I said, hey, when you get over there now, we're losing the initiative.
[01:51:15.999 --> 01:51:17.919]  And he looks directly at me and goes, stand down.
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:26.721]  And so regardless of what any of the Adam Schiff people say, the orders stand down were given to us that night.
[01:51:26.741 --> 01:51:28.342]  It was given directly to me.
[01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:33.091]  And why they sit there and they lie about it, I have no idea.
[01:51:33.291 --> 01:51:34.792]  And the majors, again, they're just trying to CYA.
[01:51:34.832 --> 01:51:37.253]  Well, obviously there's a stand-down.
[01:51:37.273 --> 01:51:41.575]  Because, I mean, eight hours of pure stand-down, why do they say 13 hours?
[01:51:41.635 --> 01:51:43.216]  And that was the whole time it happened?
[01:51:43.376 --> 01:51:48.878]  Yeah, from the time we made, from the time the consulate got contact until we actually went wheels up out of Benghazi.
[01:51:51.465 --> 01:51:55.669]  Contrast, because I hate to just sit here and say how great Trump is, but I mean it's night and day.
[01:51:55.689 --> 01:52:03.255]  The economy's coming back, taking care of the military, taking care of the borders, the people, unifying the nation, double the number of minorities supported than any other Republican.
[01:52:03.595 --> 01:52:07.439]  I mean, it's like, I look at Trump with all his energy and stamina next to Hillary, falling down and lying.
[01:52:07.759 --> 01:52:08.720]  They say Trump's a liar.
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:10.181]  I've watched what he's said and done.
[01:52:10.221 --> 01:52:11.322]  All he's done is told the truth.
[01:52:11.843 --> 01:52:13.084]  I mean, I just, it's night and day.
[01:52:13.644 --> 01:52:14.624]  Yeah, I mean, it's funny.
[01:52:14.644 --> 01:52:16.985]  You got these people that say how he's racist, he's a liar.
[01:52:17.005 --> 01:52:19.766]  Well, give me an example of how he's racist, why he's a liar.
[01:52:19.807 --> 01:52:22.568]  What has he not done yet that he said he's going to do?
[01:52:23.728 --> 01:52:26.709]  I mean, a lot of things are going to take time and ain't going to happen overnight.
[01:52:26.849 --> 01:52:28.130]  But he's gotten a lot of it done.
[01:52:28.150 --> 01:52:28.990]  A lot of it done.
[01:52:29.130 --> 01:52:31.731]  I mean, he's got less than a year.
[01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:33.312]  I mean, look at the things he's changed.
[01:52:33.332 --> 01:52:36.733]  Look at the direction that other nations are taking towards us.
[01:52:37.554 --> 01:52:38.114]  Is it perfect?
[01:52:38.174 --> 01:52:38.954]  No, it's not perfect.
[01:52:38.994 --> 01:52:39.514]  But you know what?
[01:52:39.554 --> 01:52:40.695]  He's putting us back on top.
[01:52:41.991 --> 01:52:45.133]  And there's all these little cowards that sold the country out and thought they were powerful.
[01:52:45.193 --> 01:52:52.337]  I don't get how the universities and these elites, they literally, I used to hear this when I was a kid and I got sick of hearing it and I didn't believe it.
[01:52:52.737 --> 01:52:53.458]  But now I know it's true.
[01:52:53.478 --> 01:52:58.221]  There is a literal hate of America and a hate of free market and a hate of success.
[01:52:58.261 --> 01:53:02.203]  I don't know how they train so many Americans to join that losing team.
[01:53:02.283 --> 01:53:02.863]  I don't get it.
[01:53:03.284 --> 01:53:05.405]  I think it goes back to the participation trophies.
[01:53:07.421 --> 01:53:09.703]  You know, you can still be a winner if you lose.
[01:53:10.983 --> 01:53:14.345]  I didn't get into your background, but a few minutes on that because it's interesting to the listeners.
[01:53:14.665 --> 01:53:19.728]  Tell folks about your career, getting into the Marine Corps, all the combat, the contractor, the CIA.
[01:53:19.948 --> 01:53:21.049]  What was that whole experience like?
[01:53:22.153 --> 01:53:23.894]  It seemed it.
[01:53:23.914 --> 01:53:24.375]  It was fun.
[01:53:24.575 --> 01:53:25.055]  I enjoyed it.
[01:53:25.075 --> 01:53:35.323]  You know, I joined the Marine Corps back in 95, got out as an E5 in 99 and, you know, started contracting in 2003 and, you know, did it for, you know, good 10 solid years.
[01:53:36.124 --> 01:53:39.106]  A lot of people think that Benghazi happened and we all quit working.
[01:53:39.186 --> 01:53:39.887]  No, we all went.
[01:53:40.007 --> 01:53:40.447]  Actually, I would.
[01:53:40.487 --> 01:53:41.528]  I did two more deployments.
[01:53:41.588 --> 01:53:46.052]  I had to wait about six months for my lungs to heal from the fire going on the console.
[01:53:46.072 --> 01:53:49.734]  But, you know, I enjoyed the job and, you know, not all of it was.
[01:53:50.967 --> 01:53:54.869]  You know, like the 13 Hours movie, a lot of it is more mundane stuff.
[01:53:54.929 --> 01:53:58.031]  You have to force yourself to stay motivated.
[01:53:58.051 --> 01:54:01.053]  I enjoyed the work.
[01:54:01.073 --> 01:54:01.754]  It was fun work.
[01:54:01.814 --> 01:54:03.314]  If I could do it again, I probably would.
[01:54:03.955 --> 01:54:05.556]  You say one part of the film that wasn't active.
[01:54:05.576 --> 01:54:07.297]  You mean force yourself to be motivated?
[01:54:08.214 --> 01:54:09.675]  I mean, like, you were really exhausted?
[01:54:10.296 --> 01:54:12.358]  Well, I mean, just when stuff ain't going on.
[01:54:12.378 --> 01:54:16.362]  Because there's a lot of times... Well, there's that thing where they've got Tonto falling asleep.
[01:54:16.962 --> 01:54:17.943]  Well, he does that anyways.
[01:54:19.064 --> 01:54:19.805]  You know, he's a ranger.
[01:54:19.825 --> 01:54:20.486]  They do that.
[01:54:20.786 --> 01:54:22.527]  They sleep during, you know, tough times.
[01:54:24.246 --> 01:54:26.767]  So there's always Marines and Army messing with each other, right?
[01:54:26.887 --> 01:54:28.308]  Oh yeah, all the branches.
[01:54:28.468 --> 01:54:29.648]  He was the only Army guy there, right?
[01:54:29.808 --> 01:54:31.089]  Yep, he was the only guy.
[01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:36.631]  So why is there a proclivity of mainly Marines and stuff in the CIA?
[01:54:37.871 --> 01:54:40.132]  There's a lot of those though, right?
[01:54:40.212 --> 01:54:40.652]  Yeah, there is.
[01:54:40.672 --> 01:54:41.152]  There's a lot.
[01:54:41.172 --> 01:54:43.093]  I mean, there's a lot of SF guys that are doing it.
[01:54:43.393 --> 01:54:45.514]  We had two SEALs, three Marines, and a Ranger.
[01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:50.096]  It just depends on the group of guys.
[01:54:50.136 --> 01:54:52.738]  There's no set, like, number of who gets what.
[01:54:52.798 --> 01:54:54.659]  It's just you just show up and that's who you're with.
[01:54:55.259 --> 01:54:58.421]  So, you know, like, we only knew each other for 30 days prior to the attack.
[01:54:58.441 --> 01:54:59.702]  And a lot of it's undercover, right?
[01:54:59.722 --> 01:55:01.303]  You're, like, doing low-key security.
[01:55:01.343 --> 01:55:02.244]  Yes, it's all undercover.
[01:55:02.624 --> 01:55:04.565]  Yeah, but, I mean, you guys stick out though in those countries.
[01:55:05.606 --> 01:55:06.427]  You mean I don't blend in?
[01:55:06.447 --> 01:55:07.407]  I don't look like I'm Arab?
[01:55:08.888 --> 01:55:18.314]  Well, I know the joke, like I know this one guy, Tim Reams, and he's like 6'3", 6'4", and he just didn't fit in too good in the whole Afghanistan.
[01:55:18.354 --> 01:55:19.855]  Yeah, you don't blend in very well at all.
[01:55:20.896 --> 01:55:24.058]  But like you said, what's sad is I was told by people that have been over there, they said,
[01:55:25.026 --> 01:55:26.026]  Libya loved America.
[01:55:26.066 --> 01:55:27.166]  They wanted to be westernized.
[01:55:27.546 --> 01:55:29.947]  Qaddafi coming out of the dark, and then he got set up.
[01:55:30.247 --> 01:55:35.988]  I'm not thinking Qaddafi's a good guy, but why blow it all up and put Al-Qaeda in charge?
[01:55:36.008 --> 01:55:43.609]  Yeah, you know, he was after the 9-11, the first 9-11, you know, he really, he really saw what was going on that, you know, Bush Jr.
[01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:49.410]  wasn't messing around, so that's when he started turning and actually helping us go after the terrorist groups and was helping us out.
[01:55:50.791 --> 01:55:52.311]  So why do you think Obama set him up then?
[01:55:54.483 --> 01:56:01.366]  You know, I think it might have been for a good cause initially, because it really was the local 17th, 17th Mars Brigade.
[01:56:01.406 --> 01:56:03.467]  That's how that's who was supposed to protect the consulate.
[01:56:03.867 --> 01:56:10.050]  They started the uprising in Benghazi initially, and that's kind of this is kind of where it started going.
[01:56:10.090 --> 01:56:17.713]  And so it was mainly it seemed like what I was paying attention to was the locals, the civilians that were coming together and trying to push Gaddafi out.
[01:56:17.753 --> 01:56:19.594]  And, you know, he was using the airplanes against them.
[01:56:19.634 --> 01:56:20.655]  Then NATO stepped in.
[01:56:21.355 --> 01:56:23.316]  You know, I think maybe they truly thought they could
[01:56:26.044 --> 01:56:29.705]  I guess make it a democratic nation.
[01:56:29.725 --> 01:56:31.166]  But now it's a failed state.
[01:56:31.426 --> 01:56:48.211]  Because we turned our back on them after we pretty much pulled out of Benghazi the whole, you know, like a week after the ambassador got killed, you know, a couple, I think 100,000 local Libyans or Benghazis came up, rose up against Ansar al-Sharif and pushed them out of Benghazi by themselves because they didn't like the fact they killed the ambassador.
[01:56:48.511 --> 01:56:51.051]  What was it like serving under Obama when he was the president?
[01:56:51.071 --> 01:56:52.332]  That would be a creepy feeling for me.
[01:56:53.292 --> 01:56:57.556]  Um, I think for us as contractors, working with the agency was a little bit different.
[01:56:57.696 --> 01:57:00.338]  But, you know, serving in the military, it definitely would have sucked.
[01:57:00.718 --> 01:57:04.161]  The rules of engagement was totally against you.
[01:57:05.222 --> 01:57:07.163]  You had to wait for somebody to physically shoot you.
[01:57:07.203 --> 01:57:10.066]  They could be having their gun, bring their gun up.
[01:57:10.106 --> 01:57:11.727]  As long as they don't pull the trigger, you can't do anything.
[01:57:12.548 --> 01:57:14.229]  Once they pull the trigger, then you can engage.
[01:57:14.249 --> 01:57:16.771]  But they pull the trigger, drop their gun, you're just not supposed to engage them anymore.
[01:57:17.847 --> 01:57:18.808]  I remember reading that.
[01:57:18.908 --> 01:57:23.370]  So even if they shoot at you, if they drop the gun, you can't shoot back at them?
[01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:25.472]  Yeah, and it was getting a lot of people killed.
[01:57:28.306 --> 01:57:30.187]  Uh, use, uh, buildings as cover.
[01:57:30.487 --> 01:57:33.908]  They shoot from the building, and then they stop shooting, and you ain't allowed to bomb the building no more.
[01:57:33.969 --> 01:57:41.132]  That's why a lot of the air support was pretty much useless, because they had to wait for people back in the States to verify, yes, you can, or no, you can't.
[01:57:41.172 --> 01:57:45.113]  They would have... Which reversed all the gains in the Middle East and caused the whole Arab Spring, it looks like.
[01:57:45.233 --> 01:57:47.354]  Yep, and then now look at what Mattis is doing.
[01:57:47.374 --> 01:57:48.815]  They've already freaking demolished...
[01:58:02.156 --> 01:58:03.377]  The circle is now complete.
[01:58:04.198 --> 01:58:06.180]  When I left you, I was but a learner.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:08.161]  Now I am the master.
[01:58:08.862 --> 01:58:10.463]  Only a master of evil, Darth.
[01:58:14.106 --> 01:58:15.968]  Your powers are weak, old man.
[01:58:16.008 --> 01:58:18.210]  You can't win, Darth.
[01:58:18.991 --> 01:58:23.354]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[01:58:33.522 --> 01:58:37.644]  No!
[01:58:38.244 --> 01:58:49.587]  Let's go, kid!
[01:58:49.687 --> 01:58:58.310]  We are number one trending app in news.
[01:58:58.610 --> 01:58:59.430]  Number one

[02:00:43.290 --> 02:00:43.951]  Libyan visa.
[02:00:44.651 --> 02:00:45.632]  It's official.
[02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:48.214]  Pull over for inspection.
[02:00:48.254 --> 02:00:49.134]  Sorry, sir, I can't do that.
[02:00:49.715 --> 02:00:53.237]  Pull over for inspection!
[02:00:54.658 --> 02:00:55.959]  I'm willing you to die for your country.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.281]  I'm ready to go right here, right now.
[02:01:06.822 --> 02:01:08.585]  Hey everybody, this is Jack Silva.
[02:01:09.307 --> 02:01:09.548]  Jack!
[02:01:10.049 --> 02:01:12.213]  We trained Seals at Coronado, so he knows the drill.
[02:01:12.755 --> 02:01:13.576]  Welcome to club, man.
[02:01:34.784 --> 02:01:35.665]  State's under attack!
[02:01:35.705 --> 02:01:36.385]  Let's go, man!
[02:01:36.405 --> 02:01:37.166]  State's under attack!
[02:01:37.186 --> 02:01:37.486]  Let's go!
[02:01:38.307 --> 02:01:38.807]  We gotta move!
[02:01:40.008 --> 02:01:42.971]  If you do not get here soon, we are all gonna die.
[02:01:42.991 --> 02:01:44.292]  You have a U.S.
[02:01:44.332 --> 02:01:45.133]  ambassador at risk.
[02:01:45.353 --> 02:01:46.974]  The ambassador is in his safe haven.
[02:01:47.335 --> 02:01:48.976]  You're not the first responders.
[02:01:48.996 --> 02:01:50.117]  You're the last resort.
[02:01:50.958 --> 02:01:54.961]  You will wait.
[02:01:54.981 --> 02:01:55.842]  None of you have to go.
[02:01:57.183 --> 02:01:59.325]  But we are the only help they have.
[02:02:12.867 --> 02:02:14.850]  I called for our support.
[02:02:14.890 --> 02:02:15.470]  Not again.
[02:02:15.551 --> 02:02:18.454]  You're not giving orders anymore.
[02:02:18.474 --> 02:02:19.516]  You're in my world now.
[02:02:21.258 --> 02:02:23.321]  We have 36 American lives to save.
[02:02:33.937 --> 02:02:44.025]  John Tidgen, T-I-E-G-E-N, is our guest on Tidgen.com on Twitter for now at John Tidgen, Tidgen, and he's here with us.
[02:02:44.345 --> 02:02:53.032]  My head's spinning because now Zuckerberg is in the New York Times, we'll cover this later, saying, reportedly suspects Alex Jones wanted to be banned from Facebook for the attention.
[02:02:54.513 --> 02:02:58.116]  So you ban me and make up stuff I said all over the internet, kick off
[02:02:59.695 --> 02:03:04.778]  15 million subscribers total, 9 million on iTunes, and then you say I want to be banned.
[02:03:04.838 --> 02:03:13.362]  No, I don't want to be banned, but I'll tell you this, and I said this, I'm going to keep saying what I'm saying, even though you tell me I'll be banned if I do.
[02:03:13.462 --> 02:03:15.703]  So, I've actually prepared for that.
[02:03:16.425 --> 02:03:21.271]  But I just love how they said they never want to censor anybody, but now they're all doing it, John.
[02:03:22.031 --> 02:03:23.253]  And it's just getting crazier and crazier.
[02:03:23.273 --> 02:03:24.294]  Where do you think all this is going?
[02:03:24.334 --> 02:03:26.356]  I mean, we're talking thousands of articles a day.
[02:03:26.457 --> 02:03:27.318]  I can't keep track.
[02:03:27.698 --> 02:03:29.100]  And I'm not this important.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:33.885]  They're setting the precedent to shut down all conservatives, which they now say ahead of the midterm.
[02:03:33.925 --> 02:03:35.948]  I think the president and Congress need to act.
[02:03:36.491 --> 02:03:40.394]  Oh yeah, I mean, I got about half as far as you got.
[02:03:40.414 --> 02:03:43.337]  Maybe a fraction.
[02:03:43.517 --> 02:03:44.318]  No, you got a crap ton.
[02:03:44.438 --> 02:03:46.039]  But they do the same thing to me.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.842]  Again, I'm a small guy and I can tell.
[02:03:48.862 --> 02:03:51.624]  Do you know who I saw first on Facebook and Twitter censored the most?
[02:03:52.065 --> 02:03:56.408]  It was people showing your videos or you guys on the news.
[02:03:56.468 --> 02:03:58.130]  No, you guys have been the most censored.
[02:03:58.578 --> 02:04:01.100]  Yeah, I mean, it's been going on since we started.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:03.241]  That was the first question I was going to ask you, and I'm interrupting.
[02:04:03.261 --> 02:04:03.701]  Let me start over.
[02:04:04.062 --> 02:04:05.743]  Talk about the censorship you've gone through.
[02:04:06.543 --> 02:04:09.265]  You know, just for actually even for the movie.
[02:04:09.325 --> 02:04:11.447]  I mean, the movie was totally censored.
[02:04:11.507 --> 02:04:15.149]  It was only in major theaters for like two weeks, and they pulled it.
[02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:20.393]  Even though it was sold out every time they went in, but they'd only show it like two times a day, and that'd be it.
[02:04:20.793 --> 02:04:21.593]  They'd do that on purpose?
[02:04:21.634 --> 02:04:22.374]  They'd do it on purpose.
[02:04:22.394 --> 02:04:24.716]  They totally, I mean... I remember when I went and saw it,
[02:04:25.496 --> 02:04:29.422]  It was totally packed about two weeks after, and I was like, why is it only in two or three theaters?
[02:04:29.442 --> 02:04:29.963]  I don't remember that.
[02:04:30.323 --> 02:04:34.450]  Yeah, I don't, you know, so they made sure it didn't want to really succeed.
[02:04:34.830 --> 02:04:38.456]  Of course, on iTunes and stuff like that, it's totally succeeding.
[02:04:38.476 --> 02:04:41.140]  I mean, people have been really watching it since it came out on digital.
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:42.201]  I watched it twice.
[02:04:42.221 --> 02:04:43.002]  Stay there.
[02:04:43.022 --> 02:04:44.183]  I'm going to come back and talk about the censorship.
[02:04:44.203 --> 02:04:50.048]  But I mean, I remember people trying to share a meme of you guys or a video clip of you guys going, no, we were ordered to stand down on Megyn Kelly.
[02:04:50.068 --> 02:04:53.251]  To her credit, she did that or other... I mean, that was there.
[02:04:53.752 --> 02:04:58.896]  And so that's experiencing our own veterans, our own heroes being censored by this dirtbag media back in 60.
[02:05:00.731 --> 02:05:07.133]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:05:07.213 --> 02:05:14.034]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:05:14.054 --> 02:05:29.578]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:05:34.073 --> 02:05:35.034]  Hey, have you heard?
[02:05:35.514 --> 02:05:37.576]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[02:05:37.656 --> 02:05:38.957]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[02:05:39.117 --> 02:05:40.158]  They're all censoring us.
[02:05:40.538 --> 02:05:46.423]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[02:05:46.743 --> 02:05:49.766]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[02:06:04.884 --> 02:06:08.905]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:11.466 --> 02:06:15.487]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:22.969 --> 02:06:31.492]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:37.219 --> 02:06:38.460]  John Teigen's our guest.
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:41.441]  John, T-I-E-G-E-N dot com.
[02:06:41.742 --> 02:06:47.785]  Remember, folks, his websites are more important than ever because we're not bitching and complaining here about, oh, we're censored.
[02:06:48.305 --> 02:06:53.729]  When the digital marketplace of ideas claims it's open to all and then blocks all the patriot voices.
[02:06:54.713 --> 02:06:55.093]  I think
[02:07:13.192 --> 02:07:19.715]  To bring a powerful, thought-provoking, and engaging presentation of his first-hand account of the Benghazi attacks to his audiences.
[02:07:19.735 --> 02:07:22.676]  So you're traveling the country, and you're one of these great guys.
[02:07:22.716 --> 02:07:24.037]  I'm like, hey, plug a book.
[02:07:24.597 --> 02:07:25.157]  Oh, I don't care.
[02:07:25.217 --> 02:07:26.538]  I'm not going to do that.
[02:07:26.678 --> 02:07:30.200]  But tell folks what you're doing, how they get them to your college, their church.
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:33.261]  How do they get some real Americana injected right in their veins?
[02:07:33.721 --> 02:07:36.023]  You know, you can do Instagram and get a hold of me.
[02:07:36.043 --> 02:07:38.826]  Pretty much Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, or the webpage.
[02:07:38.866 --> 02:07:39.446]  What's the best way?
[02:07:39.466 --> 02:07:39.847]  Plug them all.
[02:07:40.347 --> 02:07:40.968]  All of them.
[02:07:41.028 --> 02:07:42.009]  They're all John Tygan.
[02:07:42.409 --> 02:07:44.211]  I made it as easy as I possibly could.
[02:07:44.331 --> 02:07:44.751]  John Tygan.
[02:07:45.672 --> 02:07:47.774]  So the easiest way to get a hold of me is doing that.
[02:07:47.794 --> 02:07:49.115]  J-O-N Tygan.
[02:07:49.175 --> 02:07:50.356]  T-I-E-G-A-N.
[02:07:50.516 --> 02:07:50.817]  J-O-H-N.
[02:07:52.236 --> 02:07:54.798]  J-O-H-N-T-I-E-G-E-N dot com.
[02:07:54.838 --> 02:07:58.741]  You can tell I was trained in public school.
[02:07:58.761 --> 02:08:08.089]  We were getting into how you've been censored and the heroes of Benghazi and finally getting on Fox News and telling the truth about it and coming on this show as well with Chris Parenteau and others.
[02:08:08.489 --> 02:08:14.074]  I mean, you're not bitching and I know you guys don't want to do it, but talk about what you've been through trying to just tell your story.
[02:08:15.394 --> 02:08:17.134]  We just constantly push back.
[02:08:18.855 --> 02:08:27.156]  You know, I'll see like some posts, they'll be like really big and then I post stuff about that's either political or my opinion and it just gets squashed.
[02:08:27.236 --> 02:08:29.337]  I mean, you can just see the big difference between the two.
[02:08:29.357 --> 02:08:33.357]  They can definitely, like you said, the shadow banning thing, it's happening constantly.
[02:08:33.377 --> 02:08:37.158]  I get people that contact me and say, I haven't seen you post in, you know, like two, three weeks.
[02:08:37.178 --> 02:08:39.138]  I'm like, yeah, usually I post a couple times a day.
[02:08:39.658 --> 02:08:41.999]  So even that kind of tells you that you're being censored.
[02:08:42.019 --> 02:08:42.739]  That's a shadow ban.
[02:08:43.499 --> 02:08:47.724]  But if you send out a picture of just a sunset, suddenly 10,000 people respond.
[02:08:47.905 --> 02:08:48.005]  Yep.
[02:08:48.025 --> 02:08:51.569]  If I sent a picture, I'd say something about, you know...
[02:08:52.901 --> 02:08:55.143]  Hillary or something like that and just nothing.
[02:08:55.704 --> 02:09:01.549]  Let's pull up Trump's tweet though he put out that finally got Jack Dorsey listening where he said it's illegal the shadow banning.
[02:09:01.849 --> 02:09:07.455]  They now have computer sites that track it and we know that Trump's dialed back 90 plus percent.
[02:09:07.855 --> 02:09:09.637]  My reporter Paul Watson's 97 percent.
[02:09:09.777 --> 02:09:13.861]  I'm kind of jealous because I was only 93 percent until they totally banned me.
[02:09:14.902 --> 02:09:15.903]  And it's not just Twitter doing it.
[02:09:16.964 --> 02:09:15.903]  93%.
[02:09:17.024 --> 02:09:19.286]  Because you can see it on a graph.
[02:09:19.326 --> 02:09:22.849]  They just dial back 93% and it lets you hit a certain percentage.
[02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:27.561]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:09:27.601 --> 02:09:32.182]  We'll do like boost a post and it'll come back.
[02:09:32.242 --> 02:09:36.822]  It's been denied because it has to do with politics, so you have to appeal it and it has nothing to do.
[02:09:36.882 --> 02:09:42.723]  It's just like a, I think we're helping to get, because I got a veteran non-profit, so we're trying to help this veteran.
[02:09:42.743 --> 02:09:46.944]  You raise money for him for a burial and it came back that it was a political post.
[02:09:47.224 --> 02:09:48.104]  Well, that's what they said.
[02:09:48.645 --> 02:09:50.705]  Just so you know, you can pull this up, Project Veritas.
[02:09:51.704 --> 02:10:01.371]  Did internal stuff with the New York Times, YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter, where it's New York Times is liaisoning, and they go, on the videos, they go, who's the number, and I'm actually proud of this, I'm not that good.
[02:10:02.692 --> 02:10:03.873]  They go, well, who's the number one enemy?
[02:10:03.893 --> 02:10:04.674]  They go, Alex Jones.
[02:10:05.714 --> 02:10:07.476]  And they say, we ban everything he does, he's our enemy.
[02:10:07.736 --> 02:10:08.176]  Well, what else?
[02:10:08.216 --> 02:10:10.038]  Well, American flags and rednecks and veterans.
[02:10:10.762 --> 02:10:18.945]  And they just said, these dumb ass veterans think they're talking, these are quotes, not me saying this, they think they're talking to people that we let them talk to one percent.
[02:10:18.965 --> 02:10:22.086]  I don't know if you've seen those videos, but it's sickening.
[02:10:22.326 --> 02:10:22.566]  It is.
[02:10:22.666 --> 02:10:30.308]  That they think because you're trying to get somebody a prosthesis for their leg, and because you, what is it, they're jealous of people that are willing to serve.
[02:10:30.368 --> 02:10:30.828]  It's true.
[02:10:31.188 --> 02:10:33.069]  They have an inferiority complex.
[02:10:33.089 --> 02:10:39.351]  You know how many men are out there who think they're tough guys that don't like veterans or patriots or whatever, or like if somebody's a, you know, a jiu-jitsu
[02:10:39.411 --> 02:10:41.273]  Well, they don't like that alpha male.
[02:10:41.293 --> 02:10:44.276]  I mean, they don't like that dominance, so that's the way they get their dominance.
[02:10:56.815 --> 02:10:57.356]  Exactly.
[02:10:57.436 --> 02:11:07.166]  It's a chicken, you know what way, a chicken crap dimensions, McQueen I termed, to like in this cyberspace to sit back and then here's somebody trying to defend their country and give them a future.
[02:11:07.426 --> 02:11:08.307]  They're not willing to die.
[02:11:08.347 --> 02:11:08.767]  You are.
[02:11:09.128 --> 02:11:15.454]  And they think of that as like if they can shut you down and either like these dumb ass veterans and rednecks.
[02:11:16.235 --> 02:11:18.436]  And these InfoWars people, they don't even know.
[02:11:18.496 --> 02:11:19.796]  They think they're talking to people.
[02:11:20.416 --> 02:11:21.676]  You ought to see these videos.
[02:11:22.216 --> 02:11:22.657]  I believe it.
[02:11:22.677 --> 02:11:26.798]  There's something mentally wrong with them.
[02:11:28.258 --> 02:11:33.659]  I feel good knowing there's strong men and women and patriots dedicated to my country that are fighting for me.
[02:11:33.699 --> 02:11:36.500]  I don't feel weak when I see people that are as strong or stronger than me.
[02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:37.100]  I feel strong.
[02:11:37.728 --> 02:11:46.679]  Yeah, you can censor a lot of good people on social media stuff, but what I do, I travel around so much, you can't censor me when I'm traveling.
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:48.902]  And that's where Antifa comes in.
[02:11:49.362 --> 02:11:55.710]  They think they can shut down the internet, but everybody's just going on the ground, and we're winning there as well.
[02:11:56.491 --> 02:11:57.011]  Talk about that.
[02:11:57.252 --> 02:12:07.760]  Yeah I mean that's the more I travel the more I get out there and more I still I keep I keep speaking speak my mind and stuff and yeah so just because you shut down my my social media doesn't mean you shut me down.
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:22.652]  And that's why all the young people need to come to your events they need to get social media their own platform but also on Facebook Twitter YouTube and they should all videotape you and stream it live and let them see shut all those kids down and they'll shut some of them down but that'll make them even more awake.
[02:12:23.072 --> 02:12:23.873]  Yeah it will I mean.
[02:12:24.193 --> 02:12:25.414]  How do we force multiply the youth?
[02:12:27.409 --> 02:12:29.571]  Yeah, educate them, man.
[02:12:29.591 --> 02:12:32.613]  The sad thing is a lot of teachers nowadays are teaching the kids.
[02:12:32.674 --> 02:12:35.176]  They're going back to anti-American.
[02:12:35.236 --> 02:12:41.301]  I mean, we just helped get one teacher out of California fired last year for doing the same thing.
[02:12:41.621 --> 02:12:47.006]  He was talking, saying, if you join the military, you're the lowest of the low, you're the dumbest of the dumb.
[02:12:47.546 --> 02:12:53.351]  It's like, well, does this teacher realize the majority of the Fortune 500 companies are veteran-owned or started by veterans?
[02:12:54.332 --> 02:12:56.934]  But that's the thing that's going on in schools nowadays.
[02:12:56.954 --> 02:12:58.776]  They're just doing everything they can to bash America.
[02:12:59.036 --> 02:13:00.457]  And these are the school teachers.
[02:13:00.477 --> 02:13:05.962]  So you got to pay attention to what your kids are being taught in school if you really want to change the direction.
[02:13:07.233 --> 02:13:10.776]  You know, they're teaching about the seven pillars of Islam, but they won't teach anything about Christianity.
[02:13:10.836 --> 02:13:11.496]  Oh my gosh!
[02:13:11.816 --> 02:13:18.341]  I used to hear this ten years ago, and I was never for radical Islam, but I thought it was hype that they're teaching them in schools and making them go.
[02:13:18.361 --> 02:13:28.028]  And now there's videos and photos in Austria and in Sweden and in everywhere, and they make the kids go and actually bow down to Allah.
[02:13:28.368 --> 02:13:29.469]  They cover up the rapes.
[02:13:29.569 --> 02:13:32.551]  Finland said a 40-year-old man could rape a 9-year-old.
[02:13:32.611 --> 02:13:33.412]  It's his religion?
[02:13:33.952 --> 02:13:36.694]  I mean, I'm just like, why the red carpet to radical Islam?
[02:13:37.748 --> 02:13:41.731]  I have no idea, but again, it goes back to the parents being involved in their kid's life.
[02:13:41.911 --> 02:13:44.633]  I mean, you want to save this country, get involved.
[02:13:44.693 --> 02:13:46.274]  Don't just let the system teach them.
[02:13:47.595 --> 02:13:55.821]  I've been asking a lot of the questions here, but John, just looking at the state of the country and the censorship and what the Democrats are doing,
[02:13:57.776 --> 02:13:58.837]  They're calling for civil war.
[02:13:58.857 --> 02:13:59.717]  They're calling for violence.
[02:13:59.777 --> 02:14:00.617]  I know they've got antifa.
[02:14:00.637 --> 02:14:05.619]  We've had undercover people ourselves, but others have reported training for this uprising to kill cops and military.
[02:14:05.899 --> 02:14:10.381]  And I know they're a bunch of wimps, but at the same time, they get enough people to do that, it can be very disruptive.
[02:14:10.421 --> 02:14:14.142]  And I don't know if Trump and others really realize how serious a threat this is.
[02:14:15.416 --> 02:14:15.656]  It is.
[02:14:15.696 --> 02:14:17.737]  I mean, they're extremely violent.
[02:14:17.857 --> 02:14:23.418]  I mean, one day the conservative side, they're going to end up getting violent, and that's when it's going to get really scary.
[02:14:23.438 --> 02:14:32.160]  Because, you know, I think even people like me, the guys that I know, they don't want to have to get violent unless we have to get violent.
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:37.281]  I mean, we're going to wait until the last minute, and by the time that happens, it's going to be really scary.
[02:14:37.301 --> 02:14:42.963]  You know, Antifa, they only go around pick on, you know, I wear a Make America Great hat all the time.
[02:14:43.023 --> 02:14:43.843]  Nobody says a word to me.
[02:14:45.083 --> 02:14:45.683]  I don't know why.
[02:14:45.703 --> 02:14:49.145]  Oh yeah, because you're a tough guy.
[02:14:49.165 --> 02:14:59.009]  We watched them beat up a Hispanic guy with muscular dystrophy on his walker and he kicked their ass, three of them, so that's what they actually banned us on Facebook for.
[02:14:59.849 --> 02:15:03.591]  Because there's a little Hispanic guy kicking these three white guys' ass, they deleted that video.
[02:15:04.161 --> 02:15:12.944]  Yeah, it's... Because the archetypal image of the little Hispanic guy who is like partially paralyzed, them beating him up and him fighting back, they can't deal with that.
[02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:13.865]  It's over for them.
[02:15:13.885 --> 02:15:15.165]  But that's who they are!
[02:15:15.786 --> 02:15:17.006]  Yeah, it is.
[02:15:17.026 --> 02:15:18.747]  They just pick on the weak.
[02:15:18.767 --> 02:15:21.828]  And if they're in a big group, they really won't do it by themselves.
[02:15:22.008 --> 02:15:22.648]  I don't understand that.
[02:15:22.728 --> 02:15:25.169]  How as a man would you want to pick on the weak?
[02:15:25.409 --> 02:15:26.190]  I don't even get that.
[02:15:26.490 --> 02:15:27.570]  I don't get that either.
[02:15:27.590 --> 02:15:29.051]  Yeah, I have no idea.
[02:15:30.745 --> 02:15:39.548]  When we come back in the final segment, I'm going to give you the floor to like, give us a presentation of the speech you're going to give that's already, I know, overflow crowd and mass drop and how folks come.
[02:15:39.688 --> 02:15:43.569]  Where do they go to sign up if they want you to come speak to their college, their church?
[02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:45.470]  Because you need to be in the mega churches, you need to be everywhere.
[02:15:46.450 --> 02:15:46.950]  Where do they go?
[02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:47.631]  What's the best website?
[02:15:48.271 --> 02:15:49.091]  JohnTigon.com.
[02:15:49.531 --> 02:15:50.652]  JohnTigon.com.
[02:15:50.712 --> 02:15:53.613]  J-O-H-N-T-I-E-G-O-N.com.
[02:15:53.913 --> 02:15:55.993]  We'll tweet it out at Real Alex Jones while that's still there.
[02:15:56.453 --> 02:15:57.834]  They're trying to ban it right now.
[02:16:03.703 --> 02:16:11.184]  What do you, President Trump, expect Kim Jong-un to do about the human rights record regarding the North Korean people?
[02:16:11.284 --> 02:16:11.845]  Right.
[02:16:12.305 --> 02:16:13.165]  It was discussed.
[02:16:13.325 --> 02:16:17.286]  It was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearization.
[02:16:17.486 --> 02:16:20.806]  Well, obviously, that's where we started and where we ended.
[02:16:21.346 --> 02:16:22.747]  But they will be doing things.
[02:16:22.847 --> 02:16:25.327]  And I think he wants to do things.
[02:16:25.387 --> 02:16:26.207]  I think he wants to.
[02:16:26.607 --> 02:16:27.688]  You'd be very surprised.
[02:16:27.988 --> 02:16:29.848]  Very smart, very good negotiator.
[02:16:31.156 --> 02:16:32.417]  Wants to do the right thing.
[02:16:32.457 --> 02:16:36.399]  Well, I appreciate Scott Adams coming on on short notice, creator of Dilbert, you name it.
[02:16:37.079 --> 02:16:42.202]  Really life coach is what he segwayed into and very, very popular online doing that.
[02:16:42.222 --> 02:16:49.526]  And of course, he's been at the center of the whole Kanye West awakening process and made the point a few months ago that Kanye had blown a hole in reality.
[02:16:49.626 --> 02:16:51.907]  So I guess that reality could then start pouring in.
[02:16:52.047 --> 02:16:57.510]  Scott Adams, you're really good at putting your finger on the major pulse of the good things and the bad things.
[02:16:57.550 --> 02:17:00.192]  But if Kanye blew a hole in reality, which I agree,
[02:17:00.652 --> 02:17:03.634]  And now that breach has turned into a huge gaping maw.
[02:17:03.714 --> 02:17:05.215]  Where are we historically right now?
[02:17:05.235 --> 02:17:05.835]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:17:05.976 --> 02:17:08.297]  Well, I call it the beginning of the Golden Age.
[02:17:08.978 --> 02:17:17.363]  I've been defining the Golden Age as that moment when people start realizing that the remaining big problems are no longer physical.
[02:17:17.863 --> 02:17:20.286]  A physical problem would be you run out of food.
[02:17:20.526 --> 02:17:21.688]  And we're not in that situation.
[02:17:21.708 --> 02:17:24.551]  We're more in a situation where North Korea is a perfect example.
[02:17:24.731 --> 02:17:28.816]  We were worried about what they were thinking, and they were worried about what we were thinking.
[02:17:28.896 --> 02:17:34.282]  But neither of us had any reason to be at war, or to start a war, or to continue bad feelings.
[02:17:34.442 --> 02:17:37.906]  So by both Chairman Kim, who said it first,
[02:17:38.166 --> 02:17:44.792]  By the way, he said in his first statement at the summit, he said words to the effect of, let's leave the past behind.
[02:17:44.872 --> 02:17:51.577]  And then you saw President Trump with his video, that's getting a lot of attention, saying exactly the same thing.
[02:17:52.118 --> 02:18:01.486]  Because if you dwell on the past, you're stuck with, you did this that one time, or some relative of yours did something one time, or our side did something that one time.
[02:18:01.926 --> 02:18:03.227]  You just can't move forward.
[02:18:03.367 --> 02:18:06.330]  And it seems to me that the biggest story here
[02:18:06.930 --> 02:18:15.920]  That isn't reported because people don't like to frame anything positively for President Trump when they say, hey, he walked away from that summit with nothing.
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:21.666]  And I say, you know, it's easy to argue, well, he got a commitment to do this or a commitment to do that.
[02:18:22.350 --> 02:18:27.593]  But realistically, all the commitments they made, the commitments we made, are reasonably reversible.
[02:18:28.094 --> 02:18:29.415]  So it's not really about that.
[02:18:30.015 --> 02:18:46.245]  What the president did is that they have redefined the situation from two moral enemies, one who must win and the other one must lose, to two potential friends who have taken the first few steps that are not really representative of the whole journey, but they're on the right path to friendship.
[02:18:46.365 --> 02:18:50.688]  Something where we win, they win, and frankly, they win a lot bigger than we win.
[02:18:51.008 --> 02:18:52.369]  If this plays out right.
[02:18:52.889 --> 02:19:01.373]  So the whole reframing from enemies to probably friends who can help each other is what the president walked away with.
[02:19:01.913 --> 02:19:03.273]  And it's completely ignored.
[02:19:03.814 --> 02:19:10.457]  And you know, when he thought we're essentially safer from nuclear war now, and his critics said, what?
[02:19:10.557 --> 02:19:11.277]  That's crazy.
[02:19:12.057 --> 02:19:15.659]  And I say, who has a nuclear war with their ally?
[02:19:16.425 --> 02:19:20.589]  Who bombs somebody who has just offered to help rebuild your country?
[02:19:22.731 --> 02:19:27.675]  Who becomes an enemy with somebody who's got their hand out literally and figuratively?
[02:19:28.056 --> 02:19:29.997]  It's the sort of thing that just doesn't really happen.
[02:19:30.538 --> 02:19:36.844]  So he reframed the situation in a way that effectively made a nuclear war no longer have a purpose.
[02:19:37.464 --> 02:19:38.565]  Who bombs their friends.
[02:19:38.866 --> 02:19:39.767]  It just doesn't happen.
[02:19:40.187 --> 02:19:52.240]  And as long as we're on that path, even tentatively, and everybody would agree that much more would need to be done to make it real, but as long as you're on this, the path to mutual benefit, nobody fights.
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:53.081]  Nobody.
[02:19:53.201 --> 02:19:54.022]  It just doesn't happen.
[02:19:54.843 --> 02:19:57.866]  And that, I think, is the biggest unreported story.
[02:20:03.741 --> 02:20:07.802]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:21.126 --> 02:20:22.867]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.247 --> 02:20:26.128]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:20:43.476 --> 02:20:44.597]  The circle is now complete.
[02:20:45.538 --> 02:20:47.339]  When I left you, I was but a learner.
[02:20:47.639 --> 02:20:49.401]  Now I am the master.
[02:20:50.181 --> 02:20:51.743]  Only a master of evil, Darth.
[02:20:55.426 --> 02:20:57.227]  Your power's a weak old man.
[02:20:58.348 --> 02:20:59.369]  You can't win, Darth.
[02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:04.673]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[02:21:06.034 --> 02:21:06.535]  Alright, folks.
[02:21:06.575 --> 02:21:09.497]  Jon Tygen, one of the great Patriot heroes.
[02:21:09.537 --> 02:21:10.918]  He is a hero of Benghazi's here.
[02:21:10.938 --> 02:21:11.879]  But I'll tell ya.
[02:21:12.912 --> 02:21:15.074]  Physical courage, you're challenged with it, you do it.
[02:21:15.735 --> 02:21:22.602]  I think the courage of going public with the stand down is just as important with these other great men as what they did physically.
[02:21:23.583 --> 02:21:25.344]  But it is a great testament, he's going to be speaking.
[02:21:25.405 --> 02:21:30.289]  Unfortunately, if I want to try to come out with my kids, I don't want to try to cheat, but I know it's filled up.
[02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:32.331]  Again, maybe we can have you back.
[02:21:33.328 --> 02:21:35.469]  Well then I'm not going to procrastinate.
[02:21:35.489 --> 02:21:38.150]  Before you leave, let's pick some dates a few months out.
[02:22:00.638 --> 02:22:03.178]  For you to come in and some of your other crew will get him in here.
[02:22:03.799 --> 02:22:11.080]  And let's have an event and then I'll donate half the proceeds to the veterans group of your choice.
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:12.300]  Okay, I can do that.
[02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:15.961]  Because I used to do events 15 years ago with like 3,000 people.
[02:22:16.341 --> 02:22:18.881]  I just quit doing it because they messed with them so bad they left us.
[02:22:18.901 --> 02:22:23.322]  But I think if it's a veterans event and you guys are running it and I promote it, I think it'll be left alone.
[02:22:23.842 --> 02:22:27.663]  Yeah, I think I've only had one going to do a speaking event at one college where they
[02:22:29.170 --> 02:22:31.674]  They kind of protested a little bit, but it wasn't bad.
[02:22:32.155 --> 02:22:37.282]  But there's still that last thing for veterans and people, there's still a little bit of respect left.
[02:22:37.663 --> 02:22:38.003]  There is.
[02:22:38.204 --> 02:22:40.167]  So how do we leverage that to save the country?
[02:22:42.259 --> 02:22:45.920]  Biggest thing, I mean, just the media, they really demonize the military.
[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:51.302]  I mean, they show pretty much anything that's bad happens, they'll push that out more than anything that they do good.
[02:22:51.702 --> 02:22:52.123]  Oh, I know.
[02:22:52.223 --> 02:23:00.025]  You know, so it's trying to turn that mindset of... I gotta tell you, everybody I've met, especially combat veterans, are the best people in business, in life.
[02:23:00.385 --> 02:23:02.626]  They don't screw you over, they show up when they say they're gonna do it.
[02:23:03.146 --> 02:23:08.148]  You know, you got a problem with your house leaking at 2 a.m., you call your buddy, you know, he shows up.
[02:23:08.208 --> 02:23:10.229]  I mean, it's really true that our vets are great people.
[02:23:10.871 --> 02:23:12.171]  Yeah, we're a band of brothers.
[02:23:12.191 --> 02:23:13.652]  We stick together as much as possible.
[02:23:14.752 --> 02:23:18.993]  So, it's a good organization to be a part of.
[02:23:20.033 --> 02:23:27.215]  I just got a message from high-level folks in the government confirming the coordinated decision to ban Infowars was personally made by Zuckerberg.
[02:23:28.155 --> 02:23:31.156]  That's in the New York Times right now, too, that he said, I wanted to be banned.
[02:23:31.276 --> 02:23:39.038]  No, I knew they were going to ban ahead of the midterms, so I didn't muffle my voice to kiss their ass and not get banned.
[02:23:39.997 --> 02:23:41.838]  They don't like it when you don't do that.
[02:23:41.858 --> 02:23:43.119]  They want you to be in line with them.
[02:23:55.385 --> 02:24:06.769]  Help write the Adams Report that went to the President three weeks ago, and I'm writing a new report this weekend that's going to the President, and I'm going to be talking to high-level folks in the government as soon as I get off air at 2.30 today.
[02:24:06.809 --> 02:24:09.370]  So, you guys think you're doing this flat-footed.
[02:24:09.410 --> 02:24:09.750]  You're not.
[02:24:10.430 --> 02:24:11.610]  I mean, you think we're flat-footed?
[02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.970]  We're not.
[02:24:12.370 --> 02:24:14.131]  And so, we're going to be talking about what you're doing.
[02:24:14.611 --> 02:24:16.731]  I'm actually scared, because I'm not that good of a guy.
[02:24:16.751 --> 02:24:17.711]  I mean, I'm not perfect.
[02:24:17.751 --> 02:24:18.612]  I'm not that strong.
[02:24:19.032 --> 02:24:22.572]  And I'm really freaked out that it's us at the tip of the spear exposing all this.
[02:24:22.672 --> 02:24:23.053]  Jesus!
[02:24:23.073 --> 02:24:23.993]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:24:24.173 --> 02:24:26.453]  Well, it also takes your audience to do the pushback as well.
[02:24:26.593 --> 02:24:27.854]  Well, that's what they feel.
[02:24:27.894 --> 02:24:28.494]  Exactly.
[02:24:28.554 --> 02:24:29.294]  It's the audience.
[02:24:29.614 --> 02:24:31.334]  Yeah, everybody has to push back.
[02:24:31.694 --> 02:24:39.936]  That's one difference between how Antifa's doing what they're doing, because they are grouping together, and they're going and doing... Of course, they're a violent protest, a violent group, but they're doing it together.
[02:24:40.652 --> 02:24:41.093]  Same thing.
[02:24:41.173 --> 02:24:43.234]  We need to come together and start pushing back.
[02:24:43.655 --> 02:24:48.178]  They say in the New York Times that I called him a genetically engineered sociopath.
[02:24:48.499 --> 02:24:49.680]  It was a joke video.
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:54.043]  But he's a guy worth 88 billion dollars and the guy looks like a robot.
[02:24:54.103 --> 02:24:55.224]  It's a robot meme.
[02:24:55.304 --> 02:24:59.068]  I made a joke off other memes and read what was in the
[02:25:00.299 --> 02:25:00.619]  Yeah, that's sad.
[02:25:00.659 --> 02:25:01.099]  That is sad.
[02:25:29.125 --> 02:25:31.647]  Yeah, these people just can't, you know, they take everything too personal.
[02:25:31.667 --> 02:25:32.728]  They can't take a joke anymore.
[02:25:32.768 --> 02:25:34.010]  Have you ever had a chance to talk to Trump?
[02:25:35.131 --> 02:25:35.651]  I talked to him...
[02:25:37.264 --> 02:25:38.125]  Twice in person.
[02:25:38.165 --> 02:25:38.666]  No, three times.
[02:25:38.686 --> 02:25:40.988]  I think he's a down-to-earth guy.
[02:25:41.268 --> 02:25:43.491]  Well, he respects people that are willing to put on the line.
[02:25:43.511 --> 02:25:44.212]  He loves sponsors.
[02:25:44.232 --> 02:25:45.513]  So what did he say to you?
[02:25:45.553 --> 02:25:46.554]  I mean, unless it was off-record.
[02:25:48.236 --> 02:25:50.098]  Everything I talk about is off-record.
[02:25:50.118 --> 02:25:54.123]  But no, he thanked us for our service, what we did at Benghazi.
[02:25:54.563 --> 02:25:54.863]  Let me guess.
[02:25:54.904 --> 02:25:56.065]  He said, you're a real man.
[02:25:56.105 --> 02:25:56.986]  We need more people like you.
[02:25:57.026 --> 02:25:57.446]  We love you.
[02:25:57.486 --> 02:25:58.107]  America loves you.
[02:25:58.127 --> 02:25:58.487]  Pretty much.
[02:25:59.128 --> 02:26:01.510]  Yeah, I mean, he's always a humble guy.
[02:26:01.570 --> 02:26:03.012]  Every time I met him, he was a pretty humble guy.
[02:26:03.712 --> 02:26:04.453]  That's what Trump's like.
[02:26:04.473 --> 02:26:06.015]  He's like, listen, I'm just trying to fix things.
[02:26:06.315 --> 02:26:08.377]  I'm glad there's strong people out there and let's just do it together.
[02:26:08.397 --> 02:26:09.278]  It's going to be hard.
[02:26:09.298 --> 02:26:09.738]  Let's do it.
[02:26:09.938 --> 02:26:11.120]  Let's just be men for our families.
[02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:15.404]  Yeah, he doesn't, to me, what he's doing doesn't really, I don't, I don't believe he's thinking for himself.
[02:26:15.464 --> 02:26:17.686]  I think he's thinking for the future of his kids and his family.
[02:26:17.886 --> 02:26:18.366]  He's surreal.
[02:26:18.386 --> 02:26:20.028]  That's why they're so damn scared of him.
[02:26:20.148 --> 02:26:21.830]  He's lost $2 billion doing this.
[02:26:21.870 --> 02:26:22.931]  Yeah, and they can't buy him off.
[02:26:24.056 --> 02:26:27.118]  And the more they mess with him, he's got that scot in him, he just doesn't give in.
[02:26:27.799 --> 02:26:28.459]  Nope, he doesn't.
[02:26:28.519 --> 02:26:29.720]  He just fights back even harder.
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:36.305]  Can you imagine what it would be like if we didn't have him right now?
[02:26:36.565 --> 02:26:38.667]  If Hillary would have won, we'd be totally screwed.
[02:26:39.147 --> 02:26:42.770]  I mean, we definitely wouldn't be in a thriving economy, that's for sure.
[02:26:43.726 --> 02:26:44.726]  She'd have been selling these out.
[02:26:44.766 --> 02:26:49.589]  Again, I don't get how if you run America, why do you have it out to get it like the left does?
[02:26:49.609 --> 02:26:55.251]  You go to these meetings, I've covered them, we've seen undercover people, they literally like, F America, screw it, bring it down!
[02:26:55.271 --> 02:27:08.097]  And then they got like skinny jeans, like I'm wearing $80 jeans, they're wearing $200 jeans, they got $1,000 phones, I got a $500 phone, they got $200 shoes, I got $100 shoes, I got a $1,000 watch, they got a $10,000, they're like driving Mercedes.
[02:27:08.197 --> 02:27:10.818]  It's like, they got rich off America and they hate it.
[02:27:11.485 --> 02:27:13.126]  They don't want other people to succeed like they did.
[02:27:13.166 --> 02:27:15.709]  They want people to stay where they were.
[02:27:16.029 --> 02:27:16.970]  Or where they are, I guess.
[02:27:17.210 --> 02:27:17.931]  No, that's it.
[02:27:17.951 --> 02:27:20.813]  Again, their fear of people to succeed like they did.
[02:27:22.219 --> 02:27:25.322]  Thanks to guys like you, we beat Hillary and America's got a fighting chance.
[02:27:25.342 --> 02:27:26.824]  But I'm telling you, it was only a beachhead.
[02:27:26.844 --> 02:27:32.691]  Let's do five more minutes on the other side and talk about final comments from you and what you're going to be talking to young people and others about this week and other events.
[02:27:32.751 --> 02:27:34.292]  Briefly, I didn't plug last hour.
[02:27:34.973 --> 02:27:39.999]  Folks, there are thousands of articles a day, lies everywhere, never showing what we said.
[02:27:40.059 --> 02:27:42.101]  It's all lies, just like they do against Trump.
[02:27:44.727 --> 02:27:45.287]  I'm all in.
[02:27:45.367 --> 02:27:46.308]  I'm not worried about this.
[02:27:46.468 --> 02:27:47.509]  I just got to be right with God.
[02:27:47.589 --> 02:27:57.556]  But if you want to financially support us so that we can hire more reporters and expand what we're doing and do events with patriots like the gentleman here with us right now, like John, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:27:58.657 --> 02:28:03.340]  We're running the Stop the Bullies, Fight Back Against Internet Censorship special.
[02:28:03.941 --> 02:28:11.286]  That is one of the biggest specials ever on all of the great supplements, all the great t-shirts, the books, the films, whatever you do.
[02:28:12.605 --> 02:28:15.069]  Realize, this isn't one more channel of entertainment.
[02:28:15.430 --> 02:28:21.620]  This is the channel they want shut down because they know who I've been talking to today.
[02:28:22.761 --> 02:28:23.082]  They know.
[02:28:24.062 --> 02:28:25.563]  And they're crapping their britches right now.
[02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:29.667]  So, figure that out, ladies and gentlemen, or we lose.
[02:28:29.947 --> 02:28:32.069]  And hey, it doesn't matter with me, it's between me and God.
[02:28:32.089 --> 02:28:34.390]  As long as I do the right thing, that's all I'm worried about.
[02:28:34.651 --> 02:28:36.532]  But I'm telling you, this is your choice right now.
[02:28:36.893 --> 02:28:37.553]  Fight the bullies.
[02:28:37.613 --> 02:28:38.234]  Save the internet.
[02:28:38.494 --> 02:28:42.217]  Save InfoWars Super Special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:28:42.297 --> 02:28:50.364]  And get now the number one app in Android and iPhone in the world, only launched three and a half weeks ago, InfoWars Official.
[02:28:51.404 --> 02:28:53.026]  What are champions made of?
[02:28:53.046 --> 02:28:54.727]  Here's a man who can show you.
[02:29:12.619 --> 02:29:14.240]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:29:14.260 --> 02:29:16.161]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:29:16.181 --> 02:29:17.321]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:29:17.341 --> 02:29:18.822]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:29:18.842 --> 02:29:19.923]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:29:19.943 --> 02:29:21.483]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:29:38.932 --> 02:29:42.095]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[02:29:42.395 --> 02:29:45.437]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[02:29:45.457 --> 02:29:47.018]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[02:29:47.038 --> 02:29:47.359]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:29:47.379 --> 02:29:48.299]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:48.359 --> 02:29:50.661]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:52.903]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:30:05.012 --> 02:30:05.212]  I'm good.
[02:30:23.099 --> 02:30:32.387]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:30:32.407 --> 02:30:37.271]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:37.771 --> 02:30:40.053]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:30:40.413 --> 02:30:41.774]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:42.154 --> 02:30:51.778]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:30:51.878 --> 02:30:54.039]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:30:54.559 --> 02:30:59.441]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[02:31:03.789 --> 02:31:11.277]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[02:31:11.777 --> 02:31:24.891]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[02:31:26.332 --> 02:31:29.654]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[02:31:30.135 --> 02:31:34.257]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[02:31:34.477 --> 02:31:38.520]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[02:31:39.264 --> 02:31:55.368]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling!
[02:31:55.568 --> 02:31:56.288]  InfoWars.
[02:31:56.668 --> 02:31:58.169]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:32:02.346 --> 02:32:03.746]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:32:03.806 --> 02:32:05.247]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:32:05.307 --> 02:32:05.947]  Go ahead.
[02:32:05.967 --> 02:32:06.067]  Yes.
[02:32:06.487 --> 02:32:07.207]  Hi, Alex.
[02:32:07.307 --> 02:32:13.508]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:32:13.728 --> 02:32:17.709]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:32:17.929 --> 02:32:19.389]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:32:19.749 --> 02:32:26.450]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:32:26.530 --> 02:32:29.391]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:32:30.451 --> 02:32:34.972]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:32:35.012 --> 02:32:42.834]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:32:42.854 --> 02:32:48.675]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:32:48.815 --> 02:32:54.116]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:32:54.216 --> 02:32:57.197]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:05.803]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:32.085 --> 02:33:37.027]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.088 --> 02:33:49.411]  Alright, we've got a HD video that can't be on YouTube and can't be on Facebook because we're banned, that we're going to be airing at the start of the next hour.
[02:33:50.291 --> 02:33:56.573]  And then we've got Joel Gilbert and the founder of Judicial Watch, Larry Kamen, coming on to talk about
[02:33:57.697 --> 02:33:59.018]  What's unfolding with all of that?
[02:33:59.038 --> 02:34:06.864]  So this is a crazy time to be alive, but finishing up with our guest, John Tig, who's here with us.
[02:34:06.904 --> 02:34:09.726]  John, T-I-E-G-E-N dot com.
[02:34:10.667 --> 02:34:12.268]  You've got an event coming up in Bastrop.
[02:34:12.288 --> 02:34:19.213]  Just any other points you'd like to make, or just in three or four minutes, what you say to young people or veterans groups when you talk to them.
[02:34:19.593 --> 02:34:21.175]  What's the main message of Americana?
[02:34:21.889 --> 02:34:26.812]  You know, we're going out there to restore an F4 Phantom, you know, from the Vietnam era.
[02:34:27.312 --> 02:34:29.394]  So that's the biggest thing that they're trying to do out here.
[02:34:30.514 --> 02:34:33.636]  You know, I go out and I tell the first-hand account of what happened that night in Benghazi.
[02:34:33.796 --> 02:34:35.577]  I don't sugarcoat anything.
[02:34:35.978 --> 02:34:40.661]  But you know, there's a lot of teamwork, overcoming adversity, you know, leadership from the bottom up.
[02:34:41.921 --> 02:34:45.384]  You know, and just always moving forward, always fighting through no matter what happens.
[02:34:45.624 --> 02:34:48.566]  You know, you can't just stop and dwell on things that go wrong.
[02:34:49.907 --> 02:34:54.548]  Um, you know, we're doing that and, you know, I also got my own veteran nonprofit.
[02:34:54.568 --> 02:35:06.432]  I go around and I do a lot of speaking to other veterans and again, just telling the story out there and trying to get other veterans to tell their story because a lot of the healing, a lot of the PTS portion is a lot of guys, they don't talk about what they went through.
[02:35:06.452 --> 02:35:11.033]  Um, so the more you can talk about what you went through, what's, what's your, what you're going through.
[02:35:11.933 --> 02:35:12.654]  You start to heal.
[02:35:12.694 --> 02:35:13.595]  It's a healing process.
[02:35:13.615 --> 02:35:16.637]  You know, for me, going out there and talking about what happened that night is very therapeutic.
[02:35:17.818 --> 02:35:21.441]  So, I do a lot of speaking for a lot of veterans and stuff like that.
[02:35:22.822 --> 02:35:38.093]  Is it accurate to say, PTSD, a lot of this, you get ratcheted up to this superhuman level of like, everything's slowed down, everything's focused, and then you get back in regular life, and like, I'm not going to say I have PTSD, but doing this all the time, I feel great and have tons of energy when I'm working.
[02:35:39.284 --> 02:35:41.745]  But as soon as I'm not working, I feel like a retarded zombie.
[02:35:42.665 --> 02:35:43.865]  That's my own personal experience.
[02:35:46.085 --> 02:35:47.046]  What spectrum is that?
[02:35:47.706 --> 02:35:52.087]  The thing about PTSD, it's all different forms of things that hit you with the PTSD.
[02:35:52.147 --> 02:35:54.187]  I don't usually use the D because to me it's not a disorder.
[02:35:54.587 --> 02:35:56.368]  It's just a stress.
[02:35:57.688 --> 02:35:58.688]  So what's it like then?
[02:35:58.868 --> 02:35:59.328]  Explain.
[02:35:59.528 --> 02:36:03.969]  So what is it when I feel awake and alive when I'm working, but now when I don't I feel like a dead zombie?
[02:36:04.489 --> 02:36:07.510]  And my dad says he's a doctor, he says, well that's PTSD, but I don't know what that is.
[02:36:08.428 --> 02:36:12.170]  Um, it could be a form of a little bit of PTSD, you know, just overstressing yourself.
[02:36:12.190 --> 02:36:14.532]  You get your adrenaline going constantly, then you crash.
[02:36:15.412 --> 02:36:20.976]  Sure, but what's the archetypal, what's the standard PTSD, like for somebody that's been in heavy combat like you?
[02:36:21.276 --> 02:36:25.779]  I don't think there's really a standard, because it affects each guy differently no matter what.
[02:36:25.879 --> 02:36:29.061]  I mean, you can get extreme... Don't some people ramp up and get even more aggressive?
[02:36:29.101 --> 02:36:29.401]  They do.
[02:36:29.421 --> 02:36:35.165]  They can get extremely aggressive, you can go the wholly opposite, totally opposite direction, be just totally anti-social.
[02:36:35.205 --> 02:36:35.585]  I mean, it's...
[02:36:36.205 --> 02:36:58.780]  There's no one one cure fits all that's why there's like I've had a couple of guys come to me that we've helped He said, you know, I've hit, you know, I've went to four court four places that helped me with PTSD didn't work I was like again, dude, you cannot just go to you have to keep going keep trying so he finally found one We did we sent him to two of them and he finally found one that actually worked for him Chris Kyle got killed by a guy that was PTSD
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:00.461]  Yep, the Marine.
[02:37:02.021 --> 02:37:05.763]  It was another one that... That whole thing was a little... It was.
[02:37:05.883 --> 02:37:06.224]  ...smelly.
[02:37:07.104 --> 02:37:13.388]  So in your experience helping folks with PTSD, isn't it helping other people and having a mission?
[02:37:13.408 --> 02:37:15.589]  I mean, what's the main thing that helps people that have PTSD?
[02:37:16.169 --> 02:37:20.453]  I think it's having something to do, feel like you're involved in something.
[02:37:20.473 --> 02:37:21.394]  You've got to have a new mission.
[02:37:21.414 --> 02:37:22.855]  Yep, you've got to have a new mission.
[02:37:22.895 --> 02:37:25.597]  You're doing something better than yourself, and I think that really helps.
[02:37:26.198 --> 02:37:29.961]  And again, the guys that go out and they start talking about it, and they'll see the effects.
[02:37:30.141 --> 02:37:37.868]  I mean, I've had a lot of Vietnam veterans that come up and say, since I heard your story and you're able to talk about it, I started opening up and I was able to talk about it.
[02:37:38.789 --> 02:37:42.632]  But they're getting, they actually started getting involved with helping other veterans since then.
[02:37:43.213 --> 02:37:46.596]  So again, it's just being involved in something that's better than yourself.
[02:37:46.616 --> 02:37:48.318]  I think that really helps with the PTS.
[02:37:48.939 --> 02:37:56.226]  Because that's it, you commit yourself and then the mission's taken away and then now you're in this pathetic system where it's a bunch of jellyfish.
[02:37:56.386 --> 02:37:57.247]  You've got to have a new mission.
[02:37:57.267 --> 02:37:58.809]  Yep, you've got to find something to do.
[02:37:59.369 --> 02:38:02.710]  Well, that's what I found, just with people that I know that have been veterans and stuff.
[02:38:03.130 --> 02:38:06.011]  As long as they have a mission, they're shining and they're great people.
[02:38:06.531 --> 02:38:12.232]  But it's like you can't go to those heights of human endurance and focus and then just go back to mediocrity.
[02:38:13.092 --> 02:38:15.793]  No, it's really difficult.
[02:38:16.073 --> 02:38:18.654]  Again, you just gotta get out and do something.
[02:38:19.854 --> 02:38:21.755]  Well, you're a tough guy.
[02:38:21.775 --> 02:38:22.655]  Have you gone through PTSD?
[02:38:24.062 --> 02:38:26.886]  I'm pretty sure I got a form of PTSD and TBI.
[02:38:27.367 --> 02:38:30.531]  How does it manifest with you, if you don't mind me asking?
[02:38:31.333 --> 02:38:35.699]  Short fuse, extreme anger, a little anxiety here and there sometimes.
[02:38:40.228 --> 02:38:48.892]  And it goes from something that's little tiny, you make that little tiny thing to an extreme big thing when it's really not.
[02:38:49.012 --> 02:38:50.253]  Well, that's the thing I've noticed.
[02:38:50.353 --> 02:38:51.053]  This is my own issues.
[02:38:51.073 --> 02:38:52.974]  I don't have PTSD, but I have anger issues.
[02:38:53.394 --> 02:38:54.555]  Big stuff doesn't affect me.
[02:38:54.695 --> 02:38:55.575]  Little stupid thing.
[02:38:55.595 --> 02:38:55.755]  Yeah.
[02:38:56.316 --> 02:38:57.016]  And it's weird.
[02:38:58.577 --> 02:39:00.538]  So yeah, the littlest thing will set you off.
[02:39:00.578 --> 02:39:02.318]  And for the big thing, like, yeah, whatever.
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:05.420]  So.
[02:39:08.226 --> 02:39:08.946]  I love America.
[02:39:09.987 --> 02:39:11.367]  America has been a special nation.
[02:39:11.567 --> 02:39:15.228]  We've done a lot of big things and I just don't get people that hate America.
[02:39:15.348 --> 02:39:17.469]  I don't understand what their problem is.
[02:39:18.049 --> 02:39:27.712]  Just quantifying that as a patriot, a real American, why do you think these people, I guess they just feel inadequate because America is so powerful, the spirit of it.
[02:39:28.112 --> 02:39:29.372]  Why don't they join with it?
[02:39:29.492 --> 02:39:30.192]  I don't understand that.
[02:39:32.133 --> 02:39:32.573]  I don't either.
[02:39:32.733 --> 02:39:34.674]  I don't think I really want to understand them.
[02:39:38.251 --> 02:39:46.717]  Why could... If you hate the country so much, why don't you go to another country you agree with and go live there and then come back and tell us how much you still hate us.
[02:39:48.358 --> 02:39:49.179]  But that's not it.
[02:39:49.219 --> 02:39:50.279]  They want to dominate us.
[02:39:50.820 --> 02:40:04.890]  Yeah, they want to... You know, it's like... I hate to do this to the Muslim community, because not all of them are bad, but you got a lot of Muslims, they leave their country that they're suppressed at, and then they come here and they start setting up Sharia, trying to do Sharia law in their own neighborhoods.
[02:40:05.745 --> 02:40:07.186]  You know, it's kind of like... Exactly.
[02:40:07.206 --> 02:40:11.789]  You had to provide something like I always did, even though you've almost been... I don't... I love everybody.
[02:40:12.390 --> 02:40:21.836]  But the thing you can't say is that there's no gun zones, or that they cut women's genitals off, or they throw gays off buildings, and then the gays go, F you, we want to be thrown off buildings.
[02:40:21.856 --> 02:40:24.938]  And it's like, it's fundamentally sick... It is.
[02:40:24.978 --> 02:40:29.981]  ...that we're just supposed to roll a red carpet out when I couldn't go to Saudi Arabia and preach the Bible.
[02:40:30.061 --> 02:40:30.682]  I couldn't go to... No.
[02:40:31.963 --> 02:40:34.585]  And then I'm... But I'm supposed to be tolerant to intolerant people.
[02:40:34.605 --> 02:40:34.645]  No!
[02:40:35.734 --> 02:40:37.515]  No, it's ridiculous, man.
[02:40:37.535 --> 02:40:43.319]  I mean, why come somewhere new and change it to where you just left?
[02:40:43.419 --> 02:40:44.460]  It makes no sense at all.
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:47.282]  Or why make something worse than what it is?
[02:40:47.803 --> 02:40:48.563]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:40:48.843 --> 02:40:51.105]  I know brown people, I know white people, I know black people.
[02:40:51.125 --> 02:40:52.486]  If they love liberty, I love them.
[02:40:52.966 --> 02:41:02.153]  But don't come here and try to make me submit... I mean, I was in a restaurant on Monday, Cheesecake Factory with my $3 and my wife, and in come women in full burkas.
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:05.281]  And I literally had an anxiety attack.
[02:41:05.921 --> 02:41:07.542]  My daughters are like, what is that?
[02:41:08.083 --> 02:41:11.304]  And it's women in Halloween costumes and beekeeper outfits.
[02:41:11.904 --> 02:41:12.985]  And I don't mean that meanly.
[02:41:13.145 --> 02:41:14.346]  And I mean, I'm sitting here.
[02:41:15.946 --> 02:41:17.247]  This is enslaved women.
[02:41:17.767 --> 02:41:20.649]  This is the feminists are telling me, submit to this.
[02:41:21.089 --> 02:41:23.030]  But if Daddy wears the pants, it's bad.
[02:41:23.350 --> 02:41:24.951]  Or if Daddy loves Jesus, it's bad.
[02:41:25.031 --> 02:41:25.911]  But this is good.
[02:41:25.952 --> 02:41:28.373]  It's like, why did the feminists sign on to this?
[02:41:30.414 --> 02:41:30.774]  I don't know.
[02:41:31.354 --> 02:41:32.675]  They're going backwards and not forward.
[02:41:35.819 --> 02:41:39.361]  How did they get them, like baby ducks, to imprint on hating America?
[02:41:41.522 --> 02:41:42.122]  False narratives.
[02:41:43.703 --> 02:41:44.903]  And that's why they want to censor us.
[02:41:45.003 --> 02:41:47.044]  And you've given us the answer, John.
[02:41:47.544 --> 02:41:49.785]  The answer is, be involved online, great.
[02:41:50.245 --> 02:41:51.546]  Everyone has to hit the streets.
[02:41:51.886 --> 02:42:02.571]  If it's going to a nursing home with your dog and letting old people pet it or play the piano, just interfacing with real people, doing real things, going to a veterans group, supporting people, you know, whatever it is, just get involved.
[02:42:03.171 --> 02:42:04.432]  Yeah, get out there and get involved.
[02:42:04.712 --> 02:42:06.033]  That's how you're going to push.
[02:42:06.253 --> 02:42:13.838]  Because again, you're being censored online no matter what you do, so get on the ground and you'll make more of an impact on the ground than you will probably on social media nowadays.
[02:42:14.599 --> 02:42:15.219]  All right, John.
[02:42:15.740 --> 02:42:17.721]  We appreciate you coming in here today.
[02:42:17.741 --> 02:42:19.763]  We're going to come back and cover the New York Times.
[02:42:20.123 --> 02:42:23.065]  We got two hours of this, but this is just some of the insanity.
[02:42:23.365 --> 02:42:25.827]  They got three New York Times people here, a Pulitzer Prize winner,
[02:42:26.347 --> 02:42:29.389]  It means like an iron cross from Hitler trying to get me and my family.
[02:42:29.729 --> 02:42:33.111]  We're going to play you some of this insanity on the other side and more straight ahead.
[02:42:33.691 --> 02:42:43.336]  John, coming up, it's already sold out in Bastrop this weekend, but people can sign up at John, J-O-H-N-T-I-E-G-E-N dot com.
[02:42:43.577 --> 02:42:45.498]  They can go there and get you to speak at their group.
[02:42:45.518 --> 02:42:46.858]  But hey, no B.S.
[02:42:46.978 --> 02:42:49.560]  I want to pay you guys, take care of you guys, bring your whole families.
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:51.401]  Let's do a big event in the next few months in Austin.
[02:42:51.641 --> 02:42:52.281]  Yeah, sounds good to me.
[02:42:52.301 --> 02:42:53.262]  God bless you, sir.
[02:42:53.282 --> 02:42:53.542]  Thank you.
[02:42:53.922 --> 02:42:54.302]  Thank you.
[02:42:54.662 --> 02:42:56.964]  We'll be back with more straight ahead.
[02:43:00.405 --> 02:43:04.967]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:43:04.987 --> 02:43:05.508]  Thanks for holding.
[02:43:05.568 --> 02:43:06.488]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:43:06.628 --> 02:43:10.550]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[02:43:10.610 --> 02:43:19.314]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was
[02:43:19.474 --> 02:43:35.673]  Pretty cool, and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all you get, and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield, and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[02:43:36.113 --> 02:43:44.662]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:43:44.722 --> 02:43:49.507]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:43:49.628 --> 02:43:55.233]  And I wanted to say that it's an honour to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:05.971]  We're at Whole Paycheck.
[02:44:06.512 --> 02:44:09.634]  Or now, not at Whole Foods, but Amazon Foods.
[02:44:09.955 --> 02:44:12.557]  You know Jeff Bezos owns this now, right?
[02:44:12.597 --> 02:44:14.158]  The guy that owns Amazon, the richest guy in the world?
[02:44:14.459 --> 02:44:16.801]  It's on record that they cut back the amount of organic food here.
[02:44:17.321 --> 02:44:18.842]  It's on record they're cutting back the quality.
[02:44:18.862 --> 02:44:20.023]  Their own employees have been blamed.
[02:44:20.044 --> 02:44:23.727]  Most of your big top billionaires have got the laws written or they don't pay any taxes.
[02:44:23.827 --> 02:44:24.888]  This is a great product right here.
[02:44:26.718 --> 02:44:27.559]  We're coming up with one similar.
[02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:29.321]  You need magnesium.
[02:44:29.461 --> 02:44:30.423]  You need all this for your body.
[02:44:30.843 --> 02:44:33.006]  They say it's a scam when I sell it, but not Jeff Bezos.
[02:44:33.386 --> 02:44:40.015]  So, this is the most consumerist thing in the world by a monopoly man who's buying up the whole country to make $12 billion in one day.
[02:44:42.377 --> 02:44:43.458]  12 billion himself.
[02:44:44.459 --> 02:44:46.201]  12 b-b-b-b-billion.
[02:44:46.241 --> 02:44:47.802]  This is Bezos' private property.
[02:44:48.243 --> 02:44:49.243]  He doesn't respect ours.
[02:44:49.263 --> 02:44:51.005]  He lobbies to end small family homes.
[02:44:51.465 --> 02:44:54.008]  He wants 250 square foot coffin apartments.
[02:44:54.028 --> 02:44:55.629]  USA Today called for that last week.
[02:44:55.809 --> 02:44:58.832]  He doesn't want you to have any money, but he made $12 billion in one day last week.
[02:44:58.992 --> 02:45:00.553]  But I agree with his property rights.
[02:45:00.814 --> 02:45:02.735]  And I agree with this security officer's point.
[02:45:03.016 --> 02:45:03.876]  This is private property.
[02:45:04.097 --> 02:45:05.178]  And today they've asked us to stop filming.
[02:45:05.198 --> 02:45:08.040]  So what we're going to do is, we're going to go wait outside on the property line.
[02:45:09.521 --> 02:45:11.142]  You know, you're in private property.
[02:45:11.202 --> 02:45:13.803]  Whole Foods doesn't want you on the property.
[02:45:13.823 --> 02:45:15.883]  You can go around the parking lot.
[02:45:16.164 --> 02:45:19.645]  So, if you want to go to the sidewalk right now before we call APD.
[02:45:19.745 --> 02:45:20.645]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:45:20.685 --> 02:45:22.246]  You're not following our instructions.
[02:45:22.266 --> 02:45:23.846]  Sir, if you can go to the sidewalk.
[02:45:24.147 --> 02:45:24.527]  That's all.
[02:45:24.727 --> 02:45:25.707]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:45:25.887 --> 02:45:26.727]  I'm trying to be courteous.
[02:45:26.747 --> 02:45:27.368]  Can I get my car?
[02:45:27.528 --> 02:45:29.528]  I'm trying to be courteous and nice to you.
[02:45:29.548 --> 02:45:30.249]  You're not complying.
[02:45:30.289 --> 02:45:30.869]  I'm being really nice.
[02:45:31.089 --> 02:45:32.510]  I need you to go to the sidewalk.
[02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:34.150]  Well, sure I will, but I can't get my car.
[02:45:34.210 --> 02:45:35.571]  Maybe I can go to the sidewalk, please.
[02:45:37.418 --> 02:45:39.085]  Try it nice like you do too, big man.
[02:45:39.266 --> 02:45:39.909]  Big tough guy.
[02:45:40.713 --> 02:45:40.873]  So...
[02:45:42.589 --> 02:45:51.212]  Jeff Bezos made $12 million in one day last week, ripping you off by owning Whole Foods and lowering the quality.
[02:45:51.292 --> 02:45:56.674]  Jeff Bezos makes $1.50 on every single package he ships out on Amazon to the U.S.
[02:45:56.734 --> 02:45:58.514]  Postal Service.
[02:45:58.594 --> 02:46:02.456]  Jeff Bezos is a criminal who is anti-free market and anti-America.
[02:46:02.476 --> 02:46:08.318]  And we came out here nicely to cover it, and he had one of his dudes get in our face.
[02:46:08.338 --> 02:46:11.759]  So, the little cheetahs in there that think it's funny,
[02:46:13.135 --> 02:46:14.036]  Look at this!
[02:46:14.056 --> 02:46:15.156]  Look at this trending!
[02:46:15.176 --> 02:46:17.718]  Jeff Bezos is your enemy!
[02:46:17.918 --> 02:46:19.018]  Bezos thinks you're schmucks.
[02:46:19.739 --> 02:46:22.400]  He made $12 billion in one day, last week.
[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:24.301]  Richest guy in the world.
[02:46:24.861 --> 02:46:26.862]  And that jerk, they know my car's parked in there.
[02:46:26.882 --> 02:46:28.323]  I said, yeah, we're going to stop and go get my car.
[02:46:28.343 --> 02:46:29.524]  He said, get off the property.
[02:46:30.606 --> 02:46:31.706]  See how that works in America?
[02:46:32.026 --> 02:46:35.227]  It's like 18 of my products are private-labeled national brands that they private-labeled too.
[02:46:35.247 --> 02:46:42.309]  We had to come in here and just get in Bezos' face, because I mean, the leftists in here even told me when I had three kids, I got four now, hey, you got too many kids.
[02:46:42.389 --> 02:46:43.110]  That's the cult.
[02:46:43.390 --> 02:46:49.531]  They got magazines that say sustainable development, you know, being poor is the new chic, austerity is cool.
[02:46:50.492 --> 02:46:51.592]  Bezos isn't austere.
[02:47:04.235 --> 02:47:08.898]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.903 --> 02:47:26.570]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:47:27.330 --> 02:47:28.831]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:29.632 --> 02:47:33.915]  You know, I'm gonna give people a big secret here.
[02:47:35.242 --> 02:47:43.491]  The reason I don't talk to the Washington Post or the New York Times or be in Hollywood movies is I always feel good.
[02:47:44.812 --> 02:47:45.833]  I always feel strong.
[02:47:47.114 --> 02:47:52.320]  But when I'm with them and I interface with them, I feel like I'm dying.
[02:47:54.298 --> 02:48:04.943]  And they had this Elizabeth Williamson woman who came to a TRO last week where they were trying to take my kids off fake filings that I endangered kids with no proof.
[02:48:04.983 --> 02:48:06.484]  So that's how bad this has gotten.
[02:48:06.924 --> 02:48:11.526]  All the fake YouTube stuff that Zuckerberg thinks I'm doing on purpose.
[02:48:12.947 --> 02:48:18.730]  In a big New York Times article today where he admits he coordinated a meeting, my unpersoning
[02:48:20.503 --> 02:48:22.704]  And this lady says, I want to hear your truth.
[02:48:23.265 --> 02:48:24.646]  So I say, OK, I'll meet with you.
[02:48:24.666 --> 02:48:25.866]  I'll talk to you, but I'm going to record it.
[02:48:27.788 --> 02:48:29.128]  And we have her saying I can record it.
[02:48:29.148 --> 02:48:30.669]  They'll probably file a thing and say I can't.
[02:48:31.450 --> 02:48:32.751]  And once I met with her.
[02:48:34.572 --> 02:48:35.032]  She went.
[02:48:36.273 --> 02:48:39.695]  No one blocked anybody to get into Trump's inauguration.
[02:48:42.523 --> 02:48:43.444]  And I'm not an elitist.
[02:48:43.484 --> 02:48:48.288]  I don't think about, oh, I have the golden ticket to get in right at the front of the VIP right where the president is.
[02:48:48.388 --> 02:48:52.232]  I just thought, I'm going to get in at the mall a mile away down here where I am.
[02:48:52.272 --> 02:48:56.756]  It turned out I was staying at the same condo as Ted Cruz next door to him for days.
[02:48:59.437 --> 02:49:05.839]  I'm staying with all these former CIA and Navy SEAL commandos, just like the guy we had in here, and I'm staying at this thing right next door.
[02:49:06.119 --> 02:49:11.060]  I'm leaving the last day on Saturday after the Friday inauguration, and there's, you know, Ted Cruz walks out.
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:14.321]  That's been deleted off my YouTube now, but I'm sure somebody's got a copy.
[02:49:15.842 --> 02:49:17.342]  That's what I mean, true stranger than fiction.
[02:49:18.362 --> 02:49:22.784]  So, she looks at me and she goes, I was there that day.
[02:49:22.824 --> 02:49:26.445]  I didn't see any anti-fair Black Lives Matter blocking anybody from getting in.
[02:49:27.355 --> 02:49:30.878]  And she sat back and smiled like it was going to stir me up.
[02:49:36.162 --> 02:49:37.162]  Now, you think about that.
[02:49:37.182 --> 02:49:44.428]  And then she sent me a text message, and I blocked her at that point, after she'd been here last week, saying, I talked to my colleague that talked to you.
[02:49:44.868 --> 02:49:46.349]  He didn't see any antifa.
[02:49:48.010 --> 02:49:50.552]  Well, he talked to me inside the inauguration.
[02:49:50.652 --> 02:49:52.514]  No, you know what, Sherlock?
[02:49:53.354 --> 02:49:55.356]  It's these semantical games, and I realized,
[02:49:56.578 --> 02:49:57.518]  They know they're frauds.
[02:49:57.558 --> 02:49:58.379]  They know they're liars.
[02:49:58.979 --> 02:50:04.760]  And they know we have a soul, so they keep engaging us, playing that game.
[02:50:08.542 --> 02:50:11.863]  Hillary Clinton's gonna win 98% New York Times front page for three months.
[02:50:14.243 --> 02:50:15.264]  The moon is made of cheese.
[02:50:17.724 --> 02:50:18.244]  And that's it.
[02:50:18.344 --> 02:50:19.745]  They know they're gaslighting.
[02:50:21.032 --> 02:50:23.473]  Because I would never sit there and tell somebody a lie.
[02:50:23.853 --> 02:50:27.014]  I mean, I would never sit there and, like, try to make them feel bad.
[02:50:28.714 --> 02:50:31.095]  But they will do it all day long.
[02:50:31.195 --> 02:50:32.495]  So, here's a few of the clips.
[02:50:32.515 --> 02:50:33.796]  The whole interview is coming out next week.
[02:50:34.176 --> 02:50:40.837]  They're doing some fake profile with the most crazy, made-up crap you can imagine, trying to bring us down.
[02:50:40.857 --> 02:50:48.019]  And the first thing, she's like, well, what happens if you get taken off iTunes and stuff?
[02:50:48.340 --> 02:50:49.660]  How will it affect your business?
[02:50:50.742 --> 02:50:52.643]  And I said, I'm a free market guy.
[02:50:52.963 --> 02:50:54.884]  I'm all for money making, but it's not a business.
[02:50:54.964 --> 02:50:55.705]  It's a revolution.
[02:50:56.645 --> 02:50:58.046]  Our goal is to change the world.
[02:50:59.567 --> 02:51:03.790]  It's not to have a business or I would have joined the establishment.
[02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:04.870]  I just wanted money.
[02:51:06.071 --> 02:51:09.693]  And then she looks at me and she goes, what about your relationship working for RT?
[02:51:10.774 --> 02:51:15.757]  And she said it like she had just, you know, played the ace of spades.
[02:51:16.738 --> 02:51:17.619]  I've never worked for RT.
[02:51:17.639 --> 02:51:18.519]  I've never taken money from RT.
[02:51:18.539 --> 02:51:22.282]  I haven't been on them in like four years other than I think Max Keiser has his show on there.
[02:51:22.342 --> 02:51:23.122]  I've been on there twice.
[02:51:24.823 --> 02:51:25.584]  But that's the thing.
[02:51:25.624 --> 02:51:26.985]  They know I'm not a Russian agent.
[02:51:27.305 --> 02:51:30.767]  They're globalist agents of Carlos Slim, the Mexican kingpin.
[02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:37.612]  But that's all they've got to project because they know they're done is a confidence game.
[02:51:40.734 --> 02:51:44.497]  I've turned down thousands and thousands of interviews since I talked to this lady.
[02:51:45.455 --> 02:51:49.398]  But I'd just been victorious over a fake temporary restraining order to take my kids.
[02:51:50.098 --> 02:51:50.678]  She was there.
[02:51:51.659 --> 02:51:53.380]  I said, well, if I report this, she'll put it out.
[02:51:53.480 --> 02:51:53.820]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:53.860 --> 02:51:54.161]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:54.181 --> 02:51:54.981]  Of course she won't now.
[02:51:55.021 --> 02:51:55.682]  It's a profile.
[02:51:55.882 --> 02:51:56.662]  It's all deception.
[02:51:57.083 --> 02:52:09.851]  Because with them, these are, in my view, heartless, soulless people who see someone who has a soul, and if they can dominate me, or you, or America, they can be a real boy.
[02:52:12.688 --> 02:52:17.038]  So I thought I'd play some of this sickening audio.
[02:52:18.101 --> 02:52:22.711]  The whole thing comes out next week with articles and videos of this New York Times reporter.
[02:52:23.951 --> 02:52:37.715]  And her cohorts, who I saw in the courtroom looking at me like I was the enemy of humanity when they worked for the Nazi collaborator George Soros and Carlos Slim and the rest of it and Hillary Clinton, the pedophile maven.
[02:52:37.735 --> 02:52:40.516]  And no matter what they do, we're winning.
[02:52:41.097 --> 02:52:43.197]  And their whole censorship of us is blown up in their face.
[02:52:43.537 --> 02:52:44.418]  It's a beautiful time.
[02:52:44.858 --> 02:52:47.178]  But here's a few of the clips of what's coming up next week.
[02:52:47.619 --> 02:52:48.019]  Here it is.
[02:52:48.799 --> 02:52:51.600]  How did you first come into contact with Roger Stone?
[02:52:54.233 --> 02:52:55.374]  Oh, I guess Roger Stone.
[02:52:56.194 --> 02:53:03.017]  I was talking to JFK of him, like, almost five years ago, and he was speaking, and I met him there.
[02:53:04.198 --> 02:53:06.119]  And is he involved in the business?
[02:53:06.139 --> 02:53:09.500]  I know you've had him on the show a lot.
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:11.401]  Was he sort of your entree to Trump?
[02:53:11.461 --> 02:53:13.062]  Did he help facilitate?
[02:53:13.102 --> 02:53:17.444]  Yeah, I mean, Robert Mueller's actually asked over a dozen people about that, and I find that
[02:53:18.547 --> 02:53:19.347]  Talk about police state.
[02:53:20.828 --> 02:53:25.270]  Asking about Alex Jones and Roger Stone and what does Roger Stone do.
[02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:33.334]  Same thing he did when he had a contract with Fox for five years for like $55,000 a year where someone is a contributor.
[02:53:36.875 --> 02:53:39.896]  Fox has hundreds of people as contributors and they pay him like $55,000 a year.
[02:53:42.170 --> 02:53:43.992]  I'm not going to get into Rodgers.
[02:53:44.012 --> 02:53:46.475]  The problem is I try to give people answers that it's like real data.
[02:53:47.035 --> 02:53:49.057]  I mean, like, describe your relationship with Rodgers.
[02:53:49.097 --> 02:53:49.798]  Tell them.
[02:53:49.838 --> 02:53:52.821]  There's nothing James Bond-y.
[02:53:53.242 --> 02:53:54.483]  There's nothing sexy.
[02:53:56.225 --> 02:53:57.646]  I knew him as a JFK writer.
[02:53:59.408 --> 02:54:01.050]  And I had him on a few times.
[02:54:01.110 --> 02:54:03.753]  He's been on some of the shows covering JFK book he wrote.
[02:54:08.254 --> 02:54:11.255]  And then I met him and ran into him at a JFK event.
[02:54:11.815 --> 02:54:16.856]  So he was your entree to President Trump when President Trump as a candidate came on the show?
[02:54:17.936 --> 02:54:18.476]  Yeah.
[02:54:18.536 --> 02:54:20.097]  I mean, it was a Stoke-Emil show.
[02:54:20.497 --> 02:54:20.737]  Yeah.
[02:54:20.757 --> 02:54:22.477]  Okay.
[02:54:23.137 --> 02:54:25.678]  Hey, can I ask you about your work for RT?
[02:54:25.778 --> 02:54:26.978]  Do you still do stuff for them?
[02:54:27.438 --> 02:54:28.479]  I have never worked for RT.
[02:54:28.819 --> 02:54:29.459]  Russia Today?
[02:54:30.179 --> 02:54:31.499]  No, I've never worked for RT.
[02:54:31.799 --> 02:54:32.940]  Well, done videos for them?
[02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:34.900]  I've not done videos for them.
[02:54:36.519 --> 02:54:37.079]  You've done videos?
[02:54:37.099 --> 02:54:39.180]  You mean, have I been a guest on a TV show?
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:39.320]  Yeah.
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:41.080]  Yeah, that's not working for them.
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:44.881]  That's not... I mean, you realize people are going to hear all this.
[02:54:45.521 --> 02:54:46.161]  Yeah, of course.
[02:54:46.401 --> 02:54:49.062]  I mean, it's... I could make a whole documentary just out of this, man.
[02:54:49.222 --> 02:54:51.122]  Call it, How to Murder Truth.
[02:54:51.142 --> 02:54:54.463]  Because we can sit there and show everything I've said, everything I've done.
[02:54:54.743 --> 02:54:55.263]  Back it up.
[02:54:56.184 --> 02:54:58.684]  And I've never been paid anything by RT.
[02:54:59.044 --> 02:55:01.925]  I've never had them pay for trips.
[02:55:06.222 --> 02:55:13.664]  It's just like when I've been on the BBC, or CNN, or Fox News, or Japanese television.
[02:55:16.005 --> 02:55:19.886]  I have no financial relation with RT nothing.
[02:55:20.066 --> 02:55:20.446]  Yeah.
[02:55:22.306 --> 02:55:23.286]  Vice has been here twice.
[02:55:23.306 --> 02:55:24.287]  It doesn't work for them either.
[02:55:24.867 --> 02:55:28.648]  I mean, hey, what work have you done with the New York Times?
[02:55:29.348 --> 02:55:31.749]  So, in the New York Magazine, they had an essay.
[02:55:31.769 --> 02:55:33.289]  No, but you understand, I do not work for you either.
[02:55:34.270 --> 02:55:37.232]  No, it's the same kind of question.
[02:55:37.292 --> 02:55:39.514]  I've been interviewed by the New York Times.
[02:55:39.554 --> 02:55:43.136]  I've had the New York Times talk to me on the street probably a hundred times.
[02:55:44.097 --> 02:55:47.960]  I've been interviewed by the New York Times probably fifteen times.
[02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:49.481]  I've had them here a couple of times.
[02:55:49.501 --> 02:55:50.421]  I've spent like a day with them.
[02:55:50.682 --> 02:55:52.083]  None of what I said got in the paper.
[02:55:52.623 --> 02:55:59.448]  What would happen if Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, who am I missing, Twitter,
[02:56:01.892 --> 02:56:04.194]  Banned you from those platforms.
[02:56:04.714 --> 02:56:05.975]  What would happen to your business?
[02:56:08.817 --> 02:56:10.618]  What happened?
[02:56:10.638 --> 02:56:11.198]  My First Amendment?
[02:56:11.218 --> 02:56:12.899]  What would happen to mine?
[02:56:13.079 --> 02:56:13.680]  What would happen?
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:14.981]  Well, it's prior restraint.
[02:56:15.001 --> 02:56:15.521]  So here's the deal.
[02:56:16.021 --> 02:56:17.242]  What was the place you just banned us?
[02:56:17.282 --> 02:56:18.203]  I've been on, like, to the top.
[02:56:18.663 --> 02:56:20.404]  Uh, Spreaker or Stitcher.
[02:56:20.424 --> 02:56:20.765]  Stitcher.
[02:56:20.925 --> 02:56:21.185]  Stitcher.
[02:56:21.205 --> 02:56:21.885]  I've been on that since, what, 2013?
[02:56:21.925 --> 02:56:22.246]  Yeah.
[02:56:22.286 --> 02:56:23.987]  We went and looked.
[02:56:24.747 --> 02:56:27.569]  And we were always in the top 20 on there.
[02:56:30.037 --> 02:56:31.278]  And so the marketplace of ideas.
[02:56:31.338 --> 02:56:32.198]  I'm on competition with Joe Rogan.
[02:56:32.218 --> 02:56:33.639]  He's the biggest podcast in the world right now.
[02:56:33.939 --> 02:56:35.079]  We were routinely bigger than Joe.
[02:56:35.659 --> 02:56:35.940]  Okay.
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:37.480]  On that platform.
[02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:39.081]  So like, oh God, this guy's super popular.
[02:56:39.181 --> 02:56:40.141]  We can't handle hearing this.
[02:56:40.662 --> 02:56:41.382]  What he actually says.
[02:56:41.402 --> 02:56:42.683]  So it was a bursary signal.
[02:56:42.703 --> 02:56:45.964]  He said, we've taken them off, uh, you know, because they bully.
[02:56:46.004 --> 02:56:48.905]  Well, I had lawyers in here just a few days ago.
[02:56:48.965 --> 02:56:52.907]  We're looking at the media that we're going to have to sue because we can't just sit
[02:56:54.735 --> 02:56:54.975]  I think?
[02:57:16.124 --> 02:57:17.705]  That doesn't really do anything to me.
[02:57:17.725 --> 02:57:19.666]  Even though they took me off all those deals.
[02:57:19.746 --> 02:57:21.466]  It makes it, oh man, the thing you want even more.
[02:57:22.267 --> 02:57:30.891]  But it's in the mood to sell the idea to then finally de-platform me here with laws, lawsuits, whatever.
[02:57:30.931 --> 02:57:31.691]  That's the admission.
[02:57:32.918 --> 02:57:38.061]  And so that was last Friday, before all this happened, that they're setting the precedent to de-platform us.
[02:57:38.081 --> 02:57:39.762]  So that's how pathetic this is.
[02:57:40.342 --> 02:57:43.624]  But they're bringing up relations with RT, because I've been a guest on the show.
[02:57:44.344 --> 02:57:45.725]  It's just so un-American.
[02:57:45.765 --> 02:57:46.606]  It's so dirty.
[02:57:47.026 --> 02:57:49.407]  But it's what big, pathetic, rotting media does.
[02:57:49.887 --> 02:57:54.130]  We need your support in this epic war against censorship.
[02:57:54.950 --> 02:58:09.759]  You have no idea the millions of dollars it will cost Alex Jones and InfoWars to fight the malicious, baseless harassment lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars across the country.
[02:58:10.559 --> 02:58:14.623]  These stories, these lawsuits have two purposes.
[02:58:15.384 --> 02:58:30.499]  One is to generate vicious negative headlines that can then be cited in turn as the basis for silencing our voices at YouTube, on Facebook, on Twitter, and so on.
[02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:41.789]  It is going to cost literally millions of dollars to fight this Soros-funded onslaught against InfoWars.
[02:58:42.690 --> 02:58:44.331]  We cannot do it alone.
[02:58:45.212 --> 02:58:52.598]  Therefore, I ask you to go to the InfoWars site now and find the location where you can make a contribution.
[02:58:53.079 --> 02:58:57.643]  Go to the donation portion of the site and send us
[02:58:58.563 --> 02:59:02.566]  $50, or $100, or $250, or $500.
[02:59:03.826 --> 02:59:09.089]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have sent as much as $1,000 or more.
[02:59:09.930 --> 02:59:10.290]  Why?
[02:59:10.430 --> 02:59:16.093]  Because they know that this is the single most important challenge we face.
[02:59:17.134 --> 02:59:31.759]  Whether we win in 2018 and 2020, whether we can keep the new American Revolution going, whether the free ideas expressed here at InfoWars are allowed to continue are really up to you.
[02:59:32.219 --> 02:59:34.620]  The entire question is up to you.
[02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:36.481]  We need your support.
[02:59:37.081 --> 02:59:40.402]  We do not exaggerate the stakes or the dangers.
[02:59:40.822 --> 02:59:42.363]  We are not crying wolf.
[02:59:43.311 --> 02:59:48.654]  Please go to the Infowars.com site now and support us with your dollars.
[02:59:54.017 --> 03:00:00.700]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:03.602 --> 03:00:05.743]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:06.263 --> 03:00:11.426]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:14.335 --> 03:00:17.938]  So, the Washington Post and the New York Times are all reporting the big exclusive.
[03:00:18.539 --> 03:00:27.866]  It's up on InfoWars.com that Mark Zuckerberg, Sunday afternoon, met with the big tech giants and admitted collusion.
[03:00:28.307 --> 03:00:30.288]  Wow, that'll be great antitrust information.
[03:00:31.069 --> 03:00:33.191]  To say that I think Jones wants to be banned.
[03:00:33.331 --> 03:00:38.775]  No, what I said was, Zuckerberg, was that I don't think my users are dumb efforts.
[03:00:40.597 --> 03:00:43.139]  And that I'm ready for the big challenge.
[03:00:44.281 --> 03:00:55.747]  And that I'm not going to curtail what I say about radical Islam throwing gays off buildings or anybody else for the rules you've put in place that are anti-American and draconian.
[03:00:57.408 --> 03:00:59.629]  Now, because this is in the New York Times, it may not even be true.
[03:00:59.649 --> 03:01:02.030]  This is what the New York Times is reporting, so it's probably the opposite.
[03:01:02.450 --> 03:01:03.871]  Zuckerberg probably said the opposite.
[03:01:04.471 --> 03:01:07.973]  Confirmed, Mark Zuckerberg personally made the decision to ban InfoWars
[03:01:09.485 --> 03:01:14.346]  Billionaires now deciding what you can see and read.
[03:01:14.366 --> 03:01:22.989]  A New York Times report confirms that Mark Zuckerberg personally made the final decision to ban InfoWars.
[03:01:23.469 --> 03:01:26.210]  An article entitled, Facebook banned InfoWars.
[03:01:26.250 --> 03:01:26.690]  Now what?
[03:01:27.170 --> 03:01:38.753]  Kevin Roos reveals late on Sunday, after returning to his hotel room on a trip away from home, Zuckerberg made a decision he had hoped to avoid.
[03:01:40.370 --> 03:01:53.699]  The report adds that Facebook's CEO got personally engaged and discussed infowars linked with other executives while speculating that Jones may have wanted to get banned to get the media attention.
[03:01:55.820 --> 03:01:56.741]  You already banned us!
[03:01:56.761 --> 03:01:57.841]  You already shadow banned us!
[03:01:58.182 --> 03:02:00.143]  Put us in a frickin' Nazi gulag, dude!
[03:02:01.340 --> 03:02:01.680]  I don't know.
[03:02:25.503 --> 03:02:29.347]  Zuckerberg decided to remove the Infowars page entirely rather than just give the pages a strike.
[03:02:42.705 --> 03:02:45.368]  When he saw in the news that Apple had removed the InfoWars podcast.
[03:02:45.909 --> 03:02:46.830]  So it was a cascade.
[03:02:47.250 --> 03:02:51.915]  After seeing the news, Mr. Zuckerberg sent a note to his team, confirming his own decision.
[03:02:52.456 --> 03:02:55.239]  The strikes against InfoWars and Mr. Jones would count individually.
[03:02:55.699 --> 03:02:56.801]  The pages would come down.
[03:02:57.622 --> 03:02:59.784]  The announcement arrived at 3 a.m.
[03:02:59.844 --> 03:03:00.585]  Pacific time.
[03:03:01.892 --> 03:03:03.253]  Wow, I woke up at like 6 a.m.
[03:03:03.273 --> 03:03:04.234]  that happens, I guess right after.
[03:03:05.094 --> 03:03:11.579]  This follows a revelation that Apple CEO Tim Cook personally took the decision to ban him for worst podcast.
[03:03:12.100 --> 03:03:22.167]  Confirmation that both Cook and Zuckerberg were involved underscores the stark reality that billionaires and giant corporations that control the public discourse are now wielding more power or free speech than governments.
[03:03:22.787 --> 03:03:28.732]  Alex Jones himself tweeted Friday, billionaires and huge corporations get to decide what we say and what we read.
[03:03:30.293 --> 03:03:31.334]  I mean, folks,
[03:03:32.654 --> 03:03:38.618]  If you show Muslim articles raping women from Germany, you get banned.
[03:03:39.418 --> 03:03:40.719]  So am I trying to get banned?
[03:03:40.799 --> 03:03:41.079]  No.
[03:03:41.699 --> 03:03:46.342]  Do I want to lose those pages that we built over years with 5 million likes?
[03:03:46.602 --> 03:03:46.862]  No.
[03:03:47.303 --> 03:03:49.984]  But am I upset I lost them?
[03:03:50.124 --> 03:03:50.324]  No.
[03:03:51.565 --> 03:03:53.106]  So I guess in a twisted way you're right.
[03:03:54.807 --> 03:03:57.529]  I wanted to get you banned from engaging in censorship.
[03:03:58.593 --> 03:04:02.476]  Zucker, I don't care if you're worth five trillion dollars, don't F over freedom, dude.
[03:04:03.456 --> 03:04:07.759]  So, they're trying to sell the idea of what they've done.
[03:04:07.779 --> 03:04:10.061]  This is an incredible moment in history right now.
[03:04:10.161 --> 03:04:11.221]  It's an incredible moment.
[03:04:12.562 --> 03:04:14.363]  And I'm just honored to be part of it, personally.
[03:04:15.124 --> 03:04:16.265]  Everybody asks me, how am I doing?
[03:04:16.345 --> 03:04:16.965]  I'm doing great.
[03:04:18.987 --> 03:04:23.870]  But Mark Zuckerberg needs to know that the sleeping giant is awake and knows what's going on.
[03:04:24.570 --> 03:04:25.571]  And Congress and Trump
[03:04:26.846 --> 03:04:28.574]  We're good to go.
[03:04:33.197 --> 03:04:35.058]  Let me tell you something.
[03:04:35.098 --> 03:04:37.558]  This guy's involved in really Nazi behavior.
[03:04:38.198 --> 03:04:38.999]  He's state-run.
[03:04:39.159 --> 03:04:40.959]  And I say, stop it!
[03:04:41.279 --> 03:04:41.619]  Stop it!
[03:04:42.099 --> 03:04:43.420]  Stop your murder of the people!
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:44.800]  And the Chinese Christians!
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:47.061]  And the Chinese Buddhists!
[03:04:47.201 --> 03:04:47.461]  No!
[03:04:47.841 --> 03:04:48.661]  Tim Cook, stop!
[03:04:48.761 --> 03:04:49.081]  Stop!
[03:04:49.201 --> 03:04:49.521]  Stop!
[03:04:50.182 --> 03:04:51.462]  Think I give a damn about money?
[03:04:51.842 --> 03:04:52.682]  Being big in the U.S.
[03:04:52.702 --> 03:04:53.382]  with what you're doing?
[03:04:54.243 --> 03:04:54.503]  No!
[03:04:54.923 --> 03:04:55.123]  No!
[03:04:55.483 --> 03:04:55.703]  No!
[03:04:56.363 --> 03:04:57.304]  Stop your violence!
[03:04:57.384 --> 03:04:57.784]  Stop it!
[03:04:57.884 --> 03:04:58.264]  Stop it!
[03:04:58.364 --> 03:04:58.744]  Stop it!
[03:05:00.863 --> 03:05:06.105]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[03:05:06.845 --> 03:05:10.146]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:05:10.986 --> 03:05:17.248]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:05:19.028 --> 03:05:25.371]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[03:06:13.061 --> 03:06:23.510]  So for those of you that have tuned in to the live streams at InfoWars.com, the Wars Live Show, or have the free app, or subscribe to the podcast, you're about to see the verboten information.
[03:06:23.951 --> 03:06:24.431]  Not all of it.
[03:06:24.451 --> 03:06:35.200]  It's like a 20-minute clip that Drew, our incredible videographer, shot in Portland, Oregon, and in Berkeley, California of the Antifa and what happened.
[03:06:35.220 --> 03:06:36.481]  But you're about to see a lot of it.
[03:06:37.262 --> 03:06:38.584]  This can't be seen on YouTube.
[03:06:38.624 --> 03:06:39.886]  This can't be seen on Facebook.
[03:06:40.286 --> 03:06:42.049]  This can't be seen on dozens of platforms.
[03:06:42.449 --> 03:06:43.771]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:06:43.811 --> 03:06:45.734]  YouTube doesn't want you to see this video of Antifa.
[03:06:46.074 --> 03:06:47.936]  See the full video, InfoWars.com.
[03:06:48.918 --> 03:06:50.900]  And financially support us at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:50.941 --> 03:06:54.866]  But right now, let's just go to the verboten information.
[03:07:00.100 --> 03:07:01.761]  Owen Schroer here for InfoWars.com.
[03:07:01.781 --> 03:07:06.904]  I'm currently driving and we've got Drew here shooting HD shots right here getting B-roll.
[03:07:06.944 --> 03:07:12.027]  He's going to be putting together a documentary-style video of this weekend in Portland.
[03:07:12.587 --> 03:07:15.849]  And I wanted to let people know that we have landed, we're here safely.
[03:07:16.029 --> 03:07:27.516]  The narrative that's being spun already is that the Proud Boys or the Patriot Prayer Group or all of this stuff, these are the racist Nazi bigots that are invading Portland to, you know,
[03:07:28.997 --> 03:07:30.478]  Plunder and pillage your town.
[03:07:30.998 --> 03:07:32.939]  And if you go on Twitter, this is all you see.
[03:07:33.079 --> 03:07:35.541]  So we'll see what happens, but that's kind of the groundwork.
[03:07:35.841 --> 03:07:37.102]  My name is Rufio Panman.
[03:07:37.222 --> 03:07:39.423]  I'm the Sergeant-at-Arms for the Seattle Chapter of Proud Boys.
[03:07:40.183 --> 03:07:50.709]  In TIFA, their surface-level attack is, you're racist, you're Nazi, but really their agenda is anarchy and communism.
[03:07:51.210 --> 03:07:55.012]  They want to inflict anarchy into our system to uproot.
[03:07:55.792 --> 03:08:00.217]  What we have as Americans here in Western culture and create a communist society.
[03:08:00.617 --> 03:08:04.020]  Portland is like the breeding ground for Antifa.
[03:08:04.060 --> 03:08:07.303]  It isn't really a location where they all meet up like Berkeley kind of is.
[03:08:08.204 --> 03:08:10.587]  This is where it seems they live.
[03:08:10.647 --> 03:08:19.375]  And it seems like the city council, the mayor, and maybe even the police are all kind of linked into this way of life.
[03:08:20.396 --> 03:08:23.198]  That accommodates these kind of groups.
[03:08:23.639 --> 03:08:25.880]  Are you getting like some pre-fight jitters right now?
[03:08:26.481 --> 03:08:27.021]  Uh, definitely.
[03:08:27.662 --> 03:08:29.763]  Uh, you know, it's kind of like your birthday.
[03:08:29.904 --> 03:08:30.824]  You just get a little excited.
[03:08:30.844 --> 03:08:33.286]  You don't know if it's gonna be a surprise or, you know.
[03:08:33.586 --> 03:08:39.151]  But, uh, actually I'm more excited about, uh, seeing how many of our boys are gonna show up.
[03:08:39.731 --> 03:08:41.212]  Hopefully tomorrow is going to be great.
[03:08:41.252 --> 03:08:43.494]  Hopefully everybody can maybe turn a new leaf.
[03:08:43.815 --> 03:08:46.337]  And who knows, maybe we can have a beer and barbecue out here.
[03:08:46.377 --> 03:08:48.018]  Wouldn't that be the greatest story ever told?
[03:08:48.759 --> 03:08:50.660]  But I'm not sure that's going to be the case.
[03:08:50.680 --> 03:08:51.281]  We'll find out.
[03:08:51.621 --> 03:08:53.263]  Make sure to tune in to InfoWars tomorrow.
[03:08:55.264 --> 03:08:59.548]  Okay, now it is 10.23 here local in Portland.
[03:08:59.608 --> 03:09:06.454]  We are going to be downtown and we are going to be live from the streets at the Patriot Prayer March in just over an hour.
[03:09:22.998 --> 03:09:25.899]  We've been on the right side of history, Chuck.
[03:09:26.679 --> 03:09:29.139]  Abraham Lincoln founded our party to fight slavery.
[03:09:30.180 --> 03:09:31.680]  Stand up for freedom for everybody.
[03:09:32.060 --> 03:09:34.620]  And the left has been on the wrong side every single time.
[03:09:35.301 --> 03:09:38.941]  Their identity politics, now it's institutionalized racism.
[03:09:39.521 --> 03:09:41.422]  They're always on the wrong side of every fight.
[03:09:41.722 --> 03:09:43.902]  And today, you guys are on the right side of that fight.
[03:09:43.922 --> 03:09:44.923]  So thank you for being here.
[03:09:44.943 --> 03:09:46.163]  I'm proud to stand with you guys.
[03:09:47.956 --> 03:09:50.017]  There's tons of people with different beliefs and ideas.
[03:09:50.217 --> 03:09:54.759]  I think that eventually we've got to come together, but we can't do it if Antifa's in the middle constantly causing violence.
[03:09:54.819 --> 03:09:55.899]  It's not about race.
[03:09:55.919 --> 03:09:56.820]  It's about what's on the inside.
[03:09:56.860 --> 03:09:58.601]  We're here to promote freedom and God, and that is it.
[03:09:58.941 --> 03:10:04.183]  And we actually have that American spirit where we're going to stand up for what we believe in unapologetically, unafraid.
[03:10:04.523 --> 03:10:05.543]  Our country's getting soft.
[03:10:05.884 --> 03:10:07.544]  It's getting soft, and we need leaders to step up.
[03:10:08.945 --> 03:10:10.245]  You put your country first.
[03:10:10.406 --> 03:10:11.386]  You put your family first.
[03:10:11.406 --> 03:10:12.526]  You put your community first.
[03:10:12.606 --> 03:10:15.087]  Whatever God has entrusted you with, you take care of it.
[03:11:54.205 --> 03:11:55.365]  This footage is incredible.
[03:11:55.405 --> 03:11:56.666]  Drones, everything.
[03:11:56.726 --> 03:11:58.566]  What a great job the team did.
[03:11:58.986 --> 03:12:01.347]  Under all that fire, this is what our team got.
[03:12:01.827 --> 03:12:03.148]  I'm really proud of them for this, folks.
[03:12:03.568 --> 03:12:04.808]  CNN could ever get this.
[03:12:05.528 --> 03:12:10.630]  Who are you with?
[03:12:11.190 --> 03:12:13.050]  Oh yeah, Patriot Prayer, right?
[03:12:13.611 --> 03:12:14.051]  Yeah.
[03:12:14.251 --> 03:12:15.331]  F*** fascists.
[03:12:15.511 --> 03:12:17.972]  How are you going to call somebody?
[03:12:18.192 --> 03:12:18.512]  What the f***?
[03:12:20.435 --> 03:12:23.600]  Stephen, yeah, walk away with your silly f***ing asses.
[03:12:23.680 --> 03:12:25.844]  It was a successful day overall.
[03:12:26.805 --> 03:12:29.890]  But, coming to a close, we're about to head to the next one.
[03:12:29.930 --> 03:12:31.192]  So, that's that.
[03:12:32.287 --> 03:12:34.208]  Anyway, so tune in to all the different streams.
[03:12:34.228 --> 03:12:35.449]  It's going to be going up on YouTube.
[03:12:35.710 --> 03:12:36.830]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:12:37.431 --> 03:12:46.938]  And yeah, be tuning in tomorrow where we will be flying into Oakland to attend a rally in Berkeley, California.
[03:12:46.958 --> 03:12:48.159]  So that's tomorrow.
[03:12:48.199 --> 03:12:50.481]  And for now, this is Jake Lloyd for InfoWars.com.
[03:13:01.058 --> 03:13:02.399]  Get the **** out of our town!
[03:13:02.599 --> 03:13:03.200]  Get out of here!
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:03.560]  Get out!
[03:13:04.380 --> 03:13:05.261]  Get out of the streets!
[03:13:05.281 --> 03:13:06.342]  Get the **** out of our ***** town!
[03:13:06.362 --> 03:13:07.383]  You don't need no mask!
[03:13:07.423 --> 03:13:07.703]  Go!
[03:13:07.723 --> 03:13:09.624]  Get the **** out of here!
[03:13:09.804 --> 03:13:10.785]  Get out of here!
[03:13:10.825 --> 03:13:11.005]  Go!
[03:13:11.045 --> 03:13:13.407]  Get the **** out of here!
[03:13:13.707 --> 03:13:15.148]  Get the **** out of our town!
[03:13:15.468 --> 03:13:17.570]  Get the **** out of our town!
[03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:19.391]  Get the **** out of our town!
[03:13:19.411 --> 03:13:20.252]  Get the **** out of here!
[03:13:26.397 --> 03:13:31.301]  We are going to the Say No to Fascism, Say No to Marxism event.
[03:13:31.842 --> 03:13:36.325]  We'll see if Antifa or the Black Bloc shows up to stop our right to free speech.
[03:13:36.466 --> 03:13:45.153]  We're not in our full, you know, protective gear today with helmets and everything, so I'm hoping it'll be a little more light-hearted and Antifa won't get too violent.
[03:13:45.233 --> 03:13:48.996]  I'm told there's a big police presence, so hopefully it'll be another day of
[03:13:50.057 --> 03:13:57.739]  For the most part, peace, and hopefully the people that show up with their faces covered in black hoodies decide not to engage in any violence today.
[03:14:22.954 --> 03:14:24.775]  I'm the motherf***** hero!
[03:14:26.435 --> 03:14:27.895]  I'm the Vietnam vet!
[03:14:28.456 --> 03:14:38.098]  I'm the one fighting for freedom as they shoot down my friends and relatives in America like f***** dogs!
[03:14:39.079 --> 03:14:39.959]  I'm the one!
[03:14:40.779 --> 03:14:41.819]  I'm the f***** one!

[03:15:14.842 --> 03:15:14.882]  No
[03:15:21.261 --> 03:15:27.483]  There's a few minutes left of it in HD up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:15:27.964 --> 03:15:34.506]  And as we speak, so we can't show you who we are, we've got people attacking our servers, everything, trying to shut us down.
[03:15:35.126 --> 03:15:44.810]  But regardless, if they shut us down, you can still get the live news links and videos at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:15:45.690 --> 03:15:47.831]  Well, number one, that's why we're under attack.
[03:15:48.571 --> 03:15:49.311]  We love you all.
[03:15:49.952 --> 03:15:50.532]  Straight ahead.
[03:15:51.403 --> 03:15:53.953]  Joel Gilbert takes over with a special guest, Larry Klayman.
[03:15:54.716 --> 03:15:56.523]  Full videos on InfoWars.com.
[03:16:03.720 --> 03:16:05.342]  Hate is such a malleable term.
[03:16:05.422 --> 03:16:09.206]  I mean, you know, hate really means something, an opinion I don't agree with.
[03:16:09.426 --> 03:16:17.115]  Because if you want to get rid of hate speech, I mean, I don't see how anything you've said is anywhere close to what that New York Times columnist you showed earlier saying.
[03:16:17.355 --> 03:16:19.117]  Board members saying whites are subhuman.
[03:16:19.277 --> 03:16:22.801]  Yeah, I mean, how is that not hate speech, if there is such a thing?
[03:16:22.841 --> 03:16:24.883]  I just hate that term hate speech, because it's...
[03:16:25.544 --> 03:16:26.185]  It's not a thing.
[03:16:26.625 --> 03:16:33.591]  What really bothers me about your cases, just globally, is that I don't see anybody from the traditional media backing you up.
[03:16:33.611 --> 03:16:35.853]  And I don't understand how they can look at this.
[03:16:36.073 --> 03:16:41.057]  You know, you questioned the official narrative of what happened at Sandy Hook at some point.
[03:16:41.297 --> 03:16:44.160]  And at the beginning, you said, you made an investigation.
[03:16:44.560 --> 03:16:53.648]  I don't care what happens, anything that happens, when I get an official story from my government, if I'm not questioning it, I want somebody else to question it to make me question it.
[03:16:54.128 --> 03:17:00.231]  Even if it comes around that, hey, maybe we're going to have a rare circumstance where our government doesn't lie to us one bit.
[03:17:00.251 --> 03:17:02.132]  I mean, it might happen once in a while.
[03:17:02.492 --> 03:17:03.452]  Unicorns, bags, zips.
[03:17:03.512 --> 03:17:06.673]  But the point of the media is to be a watchdog.
[03:17:06.713 --> 03:17:07.674]  You're the fourth estate.
[03:17:07.754 --> 03:17:10.515]  I take a lot of flack for coming on your show and representing you.
[03:17:11.135 --> 03:17:12.536]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[03:17:12.796 --> 03:17:14.337]  And I say, well, you know, tell me.
[03:17:15.097 --> 03:17:24.963]  If you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is, and they'll send me a link to the New York Times, or they'll send me a link to some other article paraphrasing what you said.
[03:17:25.003 --> 03:17:27.364]  And I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[03:17:27.884 --> 03:17:31.306]  And when I go find it, and I said, well, that's not really what was said here.
[03:17:31.406 --> 03:17:33.267]  Well, then there's this back pedal.
[03:17:33.287 --> 03:17:36.569]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[03:17:36.589 --> 03:17:37.510]  I said, wait a second.
[03:17:37.530 --> 03:17:41.492]  What I want you to think about is how we need a robust marketplace of ideas.
[03:17:41.792 --> 03:17:44.833]  I don't come on your show because I agree with everything you have to say.
[03:17:44.853 --> 03:17:47.173]  You know, before the election, I wrote this article here.
[03:17:47.794 --> 03:17:50.894]  Is the First Amendment safe from Donald Trump on CNN?
[03:17:51.635 --> 03:17:52.815]  And I was concerned.
[03:17:53.795 --> 03:17:58.776]  Because when Trump made his speech that said, we're going to open up the libel law... I was concerned too.
[03:17:58.796 --> 03:17:59.557]  I don't think he got it.
[03:17:59.757 --> 03:18:03.478]  And it made me, I mean, I said, wow, that got my hackles up.
[03:18:03.498 --> 03:18:07.859]  I mean, I am not... But now in his own cases, he's using anti-slap.
[03:18:08.639 --> 03:18:09.600]  It's kind of funny, isn't it?
[03:18:09.720 --> 03:18:26.174]  You know, how this is flipped, because now that he got elected, now it is not Donald Trump, but people are anti-Donald Trump, who I should have written this article, I should have written another version of this article saying, is the First Amendment safe from people who have Trump derangement syndrome?
[03:18:26.774 --> 03:18:32.038]  You know, I remember last night we were talking and somebody said, you know, hey, has the right ever really done this?
[03:18:33.039 --> 03:18:38.201]  And I had to correct him, and I said, yes, if you bring the camera down here, heed their rising voices.
[03:18:38.221 --> 03:18:51.968]  New York Times versus Sullivan, the foundational case when it comes to our First Amendment rights, where it was constitutionalized that if you are talking about a public figure and then expand it to public events,
[03:18:52.828 --> 03:18:56.291]  You must prove defamation over the actual man.
[03:18:56.331 --> 03:18:58.932]  This was the South of the KKK suing everybody.
[03:18:58.973 --> 03:18:59.953]  That's exactly what it was.
[03:18:59.993 --> 03:19:02.655]  It was exactly what you have going on today.
[03:19:02.855 --> 03:19:14.804]  It was the civil rights movement was invading the South with people who were writing about equality, with people who were trying to make this idea of equality and civil rights infected.
[03:19:14.884 --> 03:19:16.505]  You know, they were trying to spread this idea.
[03:19:16.865 --> 03:19:20.068]  And how did these people who wanted to fight against equality deal with it?
[03:19:20.428 --> 03:19:21.749]  They dealt with it through these kind of
[03:19:21.949 --> 03:19:27.293]  Crazy defamation suits where they were trying to bankrupt anybody who came down there and tried to report.
[03:19:27.453 --> 03:19:30.916]  And now the left is trying to get rid of New York Times vs. Sullivan.
[03:19:30.936 --> 03:19:35.800]  They admit to overturn the First Amendment so they can, but I guess it's the Democrats again.
[03:19:35.980 --> 03:19:39.163]  Look, New York Times vs. Sullivan is sacred as far as I'm concerned.
[03:19:39.203 --> 03:19:43.286]  And you know, so far, I haven't seen Donald Trump actually do anything to go against it.
[03:19:43.647 --> 03:19:46.149]  I think his two Supreme Court nominees would support it.
[03:19:46.589 --> 03:19:49.571]  And I can't say the same for the Supreme Court nominees on the left.
[03:19:50.512 --> 03:19:53.455]  The Democrats are going after New York Times versus Sullivan.
[03:19:53.615 --> 03:19:55.177]  At this point, it looks that way.
[03:19:55.297 --> 03:19:56.038]  We'll be back.
[03:20:03.746 --> 03:20:06.329]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:21.610 --> 03:20:25.751]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:20:26.451 --> 03:20:27.752]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:32.753 --> 03:20:38.755]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, the fourth hour, still on the air, still fighting the forces of censorship and evil.
[03:20:39.435 --> 03:20:44.597]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you from the People's Republic of California, right from the left coast.
[03:20:44.837 --> 03:20:49.058]  You know me as a frequent guest with Alex and my new film, Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:55.082]  In the Infowars store, please support the show by buying this film at the Infowars store.
[03:20:55.122 --> 03:20:56.183]  Trump the art of the insult.
[03:20:57.183 --> 03:21:01.565]  I want to give my takes first about what's happened this past week with censorship.
[03:21:03.026 --> 03:21:06.808]  Alex Jones, like most shows and commentators, fills four hours a day of talk time.
[03:21:06.848 --> 03:21:08.688]  That's about a thousand hours a year.
[03:21:09.549 --> 03:21:11.930]  And Alex's approach is to question everything.
[03:21:12.532 --> 03:21:13.392]  You know, and why not?
[03:21:13.432 --> 03:21:14.253]  It's a democracy.
[03:21:14.313 --> 03:21:21.656]  Sometimes, and actually very seldom, he says things that turn out to be insensitive to some people or even off base.
[03:21:22.537 --> 03:21:24.718]  But so do most other commentators.
[03:21:25.258 --> 03:21:39.285]  If you've turned on what Sean Hannity calls conspiracy TV, MSNBC, these guys were Obama vision, Obama vision since 2008, promoting the phony Barack Obama as a mainstream candidate.
[03:21:39.955 --> 03:21:41.436]  Hiding his radical past.
[03:21:41.476 --> 03:21:44.017]  Hiding the fact that his father was a Russian spy.
[03:21:44.398 --> 03:21:45.798]  Hiding the radical agenda.
[03:21:46.739 --> 03:21:51.922]  The most transparent president in history was promoted by MSNBC and CNN.
[03:21:52.982 --> 03:21:55.144]  They said that he would cut the deficit in half.
[03:21:55.384 --> 03:21:56.084]  All his lies.
[03:21:56.244 --> 03:21:56.724]  All lies.
[03:21:56.764 --> 03:21:58.005]  They crashed the economy.
[03:21:58.966 --> 03:22:02.568]  Obama created a war between the classes.
[03:22:02.788 --> 03:22:03.728]  Race relations.
[03:22:03.808 --> 03:22:04.789]  The list is endless.
[03:22:05.609 --> 03:22:14.218]  So, a few wacky things that Alex Jones might say, for some people, just pales in comparison to the damage that MSNBC, CNN have done.
[03:22:15.240 --> 03:22:25.631]  And look at how they reacted when Donald Trump took the position after meeting Vladimir Putin that he was actually open to Russians' argument that they did not hack Podesta's emails.
[03:22:26.724 --> 03:22:28.926]  The media and the Democrats just kind of went crazy.
[03:22:29.386 --> 03:22:31.728]  They said, how dare you not trust the U.S.
[03:22:31.788 --> 03:22:32.948]  intelligence services?
[03:22:33.509 --> 03:22:34.790]  There's an official narrative.
[03:22:34.810 --> 03:22:35.690]  You have to follow it.
[03:22:36.751 --> 03:22:46.538]  Well, former CIA director and Obama fixer John Brennan, you know, openly threatened Trump after that, accused him of treason, called for his impeachment.
[03:22:47.098 --> 03:22:49.459]  How dare you question the official narrative?
[03:22:50.320 --> 03:22:51.501]  Well, we know in history that
[03:22:53.951 --> 03:22:54.211]  We're good.
[03:23:17.378 --> 03:23:21.240]  Saddam Hussein was lining up his forces threatening Kuwait and U.S.
[03:23:21.300 --> 03:23:24.262]  intelligence said that they were not going to invade Kuwait.
[03:23:24.942 --> 03:23:28.884]  There's no need to send a couple aircraft carriers just to make Saddam stand down.
[03:23:28.924 --> 03:23:29.724]  We don't need to do that.
[03:23:30.545 --> 03:23:31.605]  And the result was war.
[03:23:32.246 --> 03:23:34.507]  War is a failure of diplomacy.
[03:23:34.567 --> 03:23:35.988]  It's a failure of intelligence.
[03:23:36.708 --> 03:23:43.792]  Same thing, the second Iraq war was based largely on an intelligence assessment that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
[03:23:44.472 --> 03:23:44.772]  War.
[03:23:45.292 --> 03:23:46.273]  Trillions of dollars.
[03:23:47.308 --> 03:23:48.289]  5,000 more U.S.
[03:23:48.329 --> 03:23:50.649]  soldiers, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed.
[03:23:51.890 --> 03:24:03.755]  And the fatigue over the Iraq war helped to bring Obama's election, the most destructive president since Jimmy Carter, a man with a stealth, radical socialist agenda, who pretended to be moderate.
[03:24:04.435 --> 03:24:11.217]  So, the point is, a lot of destruction can happen when a president just accepts anything the intel community says.
[03:24:11.277 --> 03:24:15.119]  It's his job to bring his savvy experience from New York City, from real estate,
[03:24:16.710 --> 03:24:19.011]  To the real world experience to question everything.
[03:24:20.012 --> 03:24:22.073]  Now, let's go back to Alex Jones.
[03:24:22.113 --> 03:24:29.236]  His job as a commentator is to ask questions, maybe dumb questions, and challenge the narrative to stimulate the debate.
[03:24:29.276 --> 03:24:31.097]  It's called free speech and free thinking.
[03:24:31.798 --> 03:24:34.039]  And free speech, by definition, is free.
[03:24:34.099 --> 03:24:38.501]  If you're offended, if you don't like it, you can change the channel.
[03:24:39.261 --> 03:24:40.482]  That's what free speech is.
[03:24:41.643 --> 03:24:46.185]  I would rather be in a country where a few people get their feelings hurt before they change the channel
[03:24:47.088 --> 03:24:51.172]  Than one where the media and intel services just tell us what to think.
[03:24:51.192 --> 03:24:55.116]  OK, we're going to bring on Larry Klayman first.
[03:24:55.476 --> 03:24:56.357]  A couple of guests today.
[03:24:56.417 --> 03:24:56.977]  Larry Klayman.
[03:24:56.997 --> 03:25:06.606]  We want to talk to Larry, the great conservative attorney, head of Freedom Watch USA, to talk about this censorship and everything that's happened this week.
[03:25:06.827 --> 03:25:07.888]  Larry, are you with us today?
[03:25:08.648 --> 03:25:09.429]  I am, Joel.
[03:25:09.529 --> 03:25:10.470]  Thank you for having me.
[03:25:10.610 --> 03:25:11.171]  Good to see you.
[03:25:12.717 --> 03:25:13.357]  Great, Larry.
[03:25:13.578 --> 03:25:15.759]  Look, first of all, were you shocked?
[03:25:15.839 --> 03:25:24.744]  And if so, how shocked were you at the collusion of the big tech to censor and try to remove the Alex Jones Show from the Internet?
[03:25:26.505 --> 03:25:28.226]  I am shocked, but it doesn't surprise me.
[03:25:28.246 --> 03:25:28.987]  This is the left.
[03:25:29.067 --> 03:25:38.552]  These big entities are controlled by ultra leftist forces, whether it's Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, whether it's Twitter, whether it's YouTube, whether it's any of them.
[03:25:38.732 --> 03:25:41.654]  And what they're doing is they're colluding to limit
[03:25:42.463 --> 03:25:55.189]  Speech from conservatives, speech from libertarians, speech from anybody who doesn't agree with their socialist, pro-radical Islam, pro-radical feminist, pro-radical atheist, pro-illegal immigrant agenda.
[03:25:55.689 --> 03:25:56.950]  And it's happening to everybody.
[03:25:56.990 --> 03:25:57.830]  It's not just Alex.
[03:25:58.211 --> 03:26:03.153]  I've noticed just in the last two months that our subscriptions to YouTube have stayed static.
[03:26:03.713 --> 03:26:04.994]  Our Twitter has not gone up.
[03:26:05.074 --> 03:26:06.915]  We've been doing some major things over here.
[03:26:07.475 --> 03:26:11.157]  Now, Alex is the most extreme example of retaliation.
[03:26:11.804 --> 03:26:13.006]  Against a conservative.
[03:26:13.686 --> 03:26:16.269]  And I think there's an antitrust violation here.
[03:26:16.410 --> 03:26:22.857]  I believe that Alex could bring a case for this collusion to limit free speech.
[03:26:22.957 --> 03:26:24.419]  It's a constitutional violation.
[03:26:24.619 --> 03:26:27.342]  I'm a former antitrust lawyer of the Antitrust Division.
[03:26:27.382 --> 03:26:30.246]  I helped break up AT&T when I was a young lawyer.
[03:26:31.152 --> 03:26:32.153]  The Justice Department.
[03:26:33.273 --> 03:26:34.894]  He needs to fight back on this one.
[03:26:35.014 --> 03:26:38.115]  And I think the rest of the conservative movement needs to fight back as well.
[03:26:38.135 --> 03:26:39.316]  And I'm here to help.
[03:26:39.616 --> 03:26:41.697]  I'm a lawyer 41 years, trial lawyer.
[03:26:42.497 --> 03:26:50.361]  And I'm going to put my foot forward because it's not just Alex, but it's also Freedom Watch and everybody else that's being discriminated against in an anti-competitive way.
[03:26:51.541 --> 03:26:52.902]  Well, what can be done legally?
[03:26:53.002 --> 03:26:54.683]  I keep hearing this argument that
[03:26:56.242 --> 03:26:58.583]  These are private companies and they can do what they want.
[03:26:58.663 --> 03:27:03.205]  Is there really a legal path to reverse this monopolistic behavior?
[03:27:03.225 --> 03:27:08.747]  Well, you have private companies all the time that enter into agreements in restraint of trade.
[03:27:08.807 --> 03:27:14.449]  So what you have here is a Sherman One violation, an agreement in restraint of trade at a minimum.
[03:27:15.329 --> 03:27:16.369]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:27:16.449 --> 03:27:21.051]  And of course, they're also competitors of Alex, you know, Apple, Facebook,
[03:27:21.664 --> 03:27:22.605]  Twitter, the others.
[03:27:22.685 --> 03:27:24.206]  We're all competing, you see.
[03:27:24.806 --> 03:27:28.769]  So, and you could also maybe call this a group boycott in a way.
[03:27:29.470 --> 03:27:31.712]  So there's lots of avenues that can be pursued.
[03:27:31.772 --> 03:27:41.379]  Somebody's got to put their foot down here and action needs to be taken by Alex, by Freedom Watch, by some of my clients who've been discriminated against.
[03:27:41.419 --> 03:27:41.919]  They've been hurt.
[03:27:42.240 --> 03:27:44.341]  They've had to lay off people with this discrimination.
[03:27:44.741 --> 03:27:47.784]  It's a terrible situation and we can't allow it to continue.
[03:27:48.304 --> 03:27:49.385]  It's really the first step.
[03:27:50.026 --> 03:27:54.088]  In trying to take this country over by the ultra-left and the radicals.
[03:27:54.808 --> 03:27:59.670]  And they're doing it in the streets, they're doing it in the media, and they're doing it elsewhere.
[03:27:59.710 --> 03:28:07.454]  And then you have, of course, people out there, these apologists who claim to be conservatives, like Jonah Goldberg, you know, the National Review, or Ben Shapiro.
[03:28:08.154 --> 03:28:10.075]  These people play both sides of the streets.
[03:28:10.115 --> 03:28:11.716]  They're both anti-Trumpers, you see.
[03:28:12.376 --> 03:28:18.079]  And they try to placate the left by being an apologist of what's happening, and
[03:28:18.783 --> 03:28:27.029]  They infer that they're against Alex and others out there so they can get themselves on Bill Maher or The View or, you know, wherever, ABC, NBC.
[03:28:27.530 --> 03:28:28.971]  So you need people that talk straight.
[03:28:29.011 --> 03:28:30.612]  That's what I like about Alex.
[03:28:30.652 --> 03:28:32.794]  Before we go, we've got to go to a break in 20 seconds.
[03:28:33.334 --> 03:28:41.020]  Would you do a contingency agreement, you've done this before, where you represent the Alex Jones Show and take this case forward to the Supreme Court if you have to?
[03:28:41.040 --> 03:28:42.641]  I would.
[03:28:46.144 --> 03:28:46.464]  Would you?
[03:28:46.564 --> 03:28:46.824]  Yes, sir.
[03:28:48.974 --> 03:28:51.875]  Okay, Larry Klayman's on board to fight this fight.
[03:28:51.915 --> 03:28:59.396]  We'll be back with Larry Klayman after the break, and we'll continue talking about what can be done to ensure free speech.
[03:29:00.036 --> 03:29:03.477]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:29:03.997 --> 03:29:06.758]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:29:07.278 --> 03:29:13.099]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:29:13.539 --> 03:29:16.320]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:29:17.060 --> 03:29:20.504]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:29:20.885 --> 03:29:26.952]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:29:27.353 --> 03:29:32.318]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:29:33.055 --> 03:29:36.456]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:29:36.997 --> 03:29:43.539]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:29:44.180 --> 03:29:48.862]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:29:49.422 --> 03:29:54.504]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:29:55.104 --> 03:29:59.066]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:30:07.782 --> 03:30:13.015]  Make no mistake, we're all living in one of the most important times in human history as populist and nationalist.
[03:30:14.181 --> 03:30:19.963]  Pro-free market forces reawaken and ignite in our darkest hour and see success everywhere.
[03:30:20.683 --> 03:30:38.528]  And we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Dinesh D'Souza, the second-highest-grossing documentary filmmaker in history, best-selling author, and for that, falsely imprisoned, as the president has pointed out, announcing his pardon yesterday for a nine-month false prison sentence for getting five friends to donate.
[03:30:38.568 --> 03:30:42.369]  Hillary, again, billions of dollars, hundreds of millions in laundered money at her foundation.
[03:30:42.490 --> 03:30:42.930]  Unbelievable.
[03:30:43.170 --> 03:30:43.830]  Dinesh D'Souza.
[03:30:44.370 --> 03:30:49.133]  You know, I think, Alex, that when we hear words like dangerous from CNN, we have to learn to decode or translate what they actually mean.
[03:30:49.153 --> 03:30:50.334]  So what they mean is that Mark Rich
[03:31:06.864 --> 03:31:11.768]  Uh, no matter whether he's an arms dealer or a drug trafficker, he's not dangerous to them.
[03:31:12.369 --> 03:31:23.519]  In fact, he's on their side in the sense that he is willing to lavish billions of dollars, I mean, not millions, but tens of millions of dollars into progressive and left-wing causes.
[03:31:24.579 --> 03:31:26.281]  I actually am dangerous to them.
[03:31:26.881 --> 03:31:27.141]  Why?
[03:31:27.181 --> 03:31:31.464]  Because I'm actually out there undermining their ideology at every turn.
[03:31:31.504 --> 03:31:35.567]  And so to pardon me is to unleash me in an even bigger way.
[03:31:35.587 --> 03:31:44.754]  So when I hear these kinds of things from CNN, far from like trying to refute them, I essentially look behind the curtain and I go, I know why you're saying that.
[03:31:44.794 --> 03:31:46.215]  And in a certain sense, you're right.
[03:31:46.375 --> 03:31:47.055]  Incredible.
[03:31:47.375 --> 03:31:51.278]  And of course, the word is that the president's told you that he wants to unleash you.
[03:31:51.298 --> 03:31:52.439]  Can you talk about that?
[03:31:53.855 --> 03:32:03.798]  Yeah, I was in my study two days ago, working away, and the phone rang, you know, unknown caller, and I picked it up, and it was the White House operator.
[03:32:03.938 --> 03:32:22.623]  She just goes, she confirmed it was me, hold the line for the President of the United States, and Trump comes on, and the first thing he said to me was, hey, Dinesh, you know, I'm sitting here with John Kelly, Chief of Staff, and we both want to let you know that we think that you're a great voice for freedom and for America.
[03:32:23.563 --> 03:32:29.226]  And he said, I gotta tell you man to man that, you know, your case, you know, you got screwed.
[03:32:29.646 --> 03:32:38.370]  He goes, you should have gotten it, it was a technicality, you should have gotten a fine and move on with life, but no, these guys went after you with everything they got.
[03:32:38.910 --> 03:32:40.771]  And he goes, it was a terrible injustice.
[03:32:40.831 --> 03:32:43.833]  He goes, the good thing is, you know, I'm in a position to correct it.
[03:32:44.073 --> 03:32:46.734]  So I want to, I want to clear your slate.
[03:32:46.774 --> 03:32:48.875]  I'm going to give you a full pardon tomorrow morning.
[03:32:49.735 --> 03:32:54.740]  Uh, and I am just, I want you to go out there and just do what you're doing at an even bigger scale than ever.
[03:33:03.688 --> 03:33:06.331]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.949 --> 03:33:25.651]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:33:25.991 --> 03:33:30.313]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.535 --> 03:33:38.417]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, still on the air, still fighting the forces of censorship and evil.
[03:33:38.978 --> 03:33:42.279]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you from the People's Republic of California.
[03:33:42.819 --> 03:33:45.481]  We're going to continue with Larry Klame and the attorney.
[03:33:46.321 --> 03:33:47.542]  We'll be taking some calls 877-789-
[03:33:51.029 --> 03:33:53.790]  2539-877-789-ALEX.
[03:33:54.790 --> 03:34:04.351]  Larry Klayman, I want to ask you, we know that presidents tend to bring on people from the world that they come from into the White House.
[03:34:05.132 --> 03:34:07.712]  Barack Obama, his world was Chicago radicals.
[03:34:08.992 --> 03:34:15.293]  He knew the people in the radical left movement, ACORN, different lawyers, La Raza, you name it.
[03:34:15.933 --> 03:34:18.174]  He brought on the radicals into the government.
[03:34:20.123 --> 03:34:23.984]  Donald Trump seems like his world was talk TV.
[03:34:24.564 --> 03:34:27.085]  You know, he liked he was a cable news junkie.
[03:34:27.965 --> 03:34:32.367]  So we see people like Larry Kudlow, you know, the lawyers.
[03:34:32.667 --> 03:34:40.629]  It seems like his entire worldview and staff seems to be coming from cable TV news.
[03:34:40.670 --> 03:34:48.412]  What do you think of his cable TV lawyers and what they can do for him and where this molar probe is headed at this time?
[03:34:49.574 --> 03:34:50.194]  TV lawyers.
[03:34:50.555 --> 03:34:51.575]  It's funny.
[03:34:51.915 --> 03:34:57.618]  Years ago, I used to go to Nate Now's Delicatessen, still do, in Beverly Hills when I'm out here.
[03:34:58.399 --> 03:35:01.000]  And in Nate Now's, there was always Larry King.
[03:35:02.281 --> 03:35:04.242]  And he would meet there with his staff every morning.
[03:35:04.982 --> 03:35:06.223]  And he loved Nate Now.
[03:35:06.643 --> 03:35:14.607]  And at some point, his seventh wife, he's actually had one more than Henry VIII at six, decided to run off with the gym instructor.
[03:35:15.262 --> 03:35:17.084]  And everybody thought he was going to get divorced.
[03:35:17.664 --> 03:35:22.029]  A friend of mine who's a family lawyer in Los Angeles, I said, why do you think he's not getting divorced?
[03:35:22.089 --> 03:35:25.412]  And she said, well, he has such a bad prenuptial agreement.
[03:35:25.452 --> 03:35:26.673]  He can't afford to get divorced.
[03:35:26.693 --> 03:35:27.414]  He'll be bankrupt.
[03:35:27.454 --> 03:35:28.214]  I said, why is that?
[03:35:28.234 --> 03:35:32.919]  He says, because everybody that he chooses or deals with has bagels at Nate Now's.
[03:35:34.100 --> 03:35:35.541]  He didn't get a first rate lawyer.
[03:35:35.782 --> 03:35:37.623]  Now, here's what's happening to the president.
[03:35:38.504 --> 03:35:40.346]  The president loves Fox News.
[03:35:41.064 --> 03:35:42.825]  And Fox News has some good things on there.
[03:35:42.865 --> 03:35:45.205]  I'm critical because they don't let you say what you really think.
[03:35:45.225 --> 03:35:49.226]  That's why I love Infowars and Alex and you and Owen.
[03:35:50.207 --> 03:35:51.447]  It's censored on Fox News.
[03:35:51.487 --> 03:35:55.028]  But nevertheless, he's picking his lawyers off of Fox News.
[03:35:55.048 --> 03:35:56.088]  And who does he wind up with?
[03:35:57.048 --> 03:36:00.189]  Jay Sekulow, who's a nice guy, sees him on Fox News.
[03:36:00.209 --> 03:36:01.810]  So he thinks, OK, that's a great lawyer.
[03:36:01.950 --> 03:36:05.671]  Jay is a great lawyer when it comes to religious rights, but he's not a criminal defense lawyer.
[03:36:06.331 --> 03:36:09.652]  Rudy Giuliani, who's always on Fox News, he picks him.
[03:36:10.402 --> 03:36:19.387]  And Rudy is a really nice guy too, but he's kind of past his prime and he's been going on TV spewing forth nonsense, false facts.
[03:36:19.727 --> 03:36:21.448]  I don't think he does it intentionally.
[03:36:21.468 --> 03:36:25.770]  I think he's just getting up there in years or maybe he's had a few drinks before he comes on Hannity.
[03:36:25.890 --> 03:36:26.310]  I don't know.
[03:36:26.350 --> 03:36:31.073]  But the president needs to wind up correcting him, the president himself, his own lawyer.
[03:36:31.613 --> 03:36:33.254]  And it's getting the president in trouble.
[03:36:33.294 --> 03:36:36.956]  But the big beef I have here right now is that they're sitting here
[03:36:37.893 --> 03:36:50.738]  Letting the president get dragged along the legal guillotine is that Robert Mueller, they just made him an offer that Trump will testify to some extent with limited questions if the investigation will end.
[03:36:51.799 --> 03:36:54.680]  Well, that's an offer that only Mueller can refuse, OK?
[03:36:54.700 --> 03:36:56.581]  Because, you know, it's a question of manhood.
[03:36:56.621 --> 03:36:58.241]  It's a question of what your jurisdiction is.
[03:36:58.841 --> 03:37:00.242]  No prosecutor is going to take that.
[03:37:01.042 --> 03:37:05.564]  And it was an ultimatum that was put forward to get Mueller to refuse.
[03:37:05.604 --> 03:37:07.445]  Now, what's Mueller going to do after that?
[03:37:08.365 --> 03:37:09.866]  He's going to send a subpoena to Trump.
[03:37:10.546 --> 03:37:13.587]  This is going to then be litigated all the way up to the Supreme Court.
[03:37:13.607 --> 03:37:14.587]  It'll take a few years.
[03:37:14.647 --> 03:37:17.348]  It'll get into the 2020 elections.
[03:37:17.428 --> 03:37:26.731]  It will damage the president, and it will result in an impeachment report, in all likelihood, an interim impeachment report by Mueller within the next month or so.
[03:37:27.531 --> 03:37:37.855]  That will be intended to influence the midterm elections, and it could influence, likely would, and we may wind up with a Democrat House of Representatives that impeaches the president
[03:37:38.766 --> 03:37:47.751]  And which grinds this country to a halt as we're trying to negotiate solutions to the nuclear crisis in North Korea, Iran, dealing with illegal immigration.
[03:37:48.252 --> 03:37:49.993]  There's a lot of important issues out there.
[03:37:50.553 --> 03:37:59.078]  So these lawyers, by sitting there inert, are leading the president down the primrose path to disaster and the nation as well.
[03:37:59.819 --> 03:38:01.620]  And they're having a great time on Fox News.
[03:38:02.140 --> 03:38:05.482]  But I'll tell you something, we're not going to have a great time thanks to their inaction.
[03:38:05.542 --> 03:38:06.703]  What they can be doing, Joel,
[03:38:07.746 --> 03:38:09.467]  They should go into court right now.
[03:38:09.527 --> 03:38:10.127]  We've said that.
[03:38:10.167 --> 03:38:14.869]  In fact, I heard Mark Levin say that last night on cable news.
[03:38:14.909 --> 03:38:22.052]  Apparently he agrees with me that they should be challenging Mueller's jurisdiction to proceed and grinding him to a halt.
[03:38:22.692 --> 03:38:23.713]  By the grace of God,
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:26.420]  The President would have been elected without the grace of God.
[03:38:26.961 --> 03:38:29.401]  I think that's the only reason we don't have Hillary Clinton right now.
[03:38:29.441 --> 03:38:30.001]  It's a miracle.
[03:38:30.461 --> 03:38:35.002]  With the grace of God, maybe we get a judge that'll put his foot down here and try to block it.
[03:38:35.722 --> 03:38:46.785]  In addition to that, the President can be ordering the Justice Department to investigate Mueller, to investigate Hillary Clinton, to investigate Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr.
[03:38:47.265 --> 03:38:51.546]  I can tell you a big story about Bruce Ohr that hasn't come out lately either, you know, about his corruption.
[03:38:52.347 --> 03:38:54.029]  But he can be doing those things.
[03:38:54.069 --> 03:39:02.236]  Now, if he can be investigated, the president, why can't he have these people investigated and order Sessions and Rosenstein to do it?
[03:39:02.676 --> 03:39:06.640]  So these lawyers, they're part of this Washington establishment club.
[03:39:07.361 --> 03:39:08.702]  They love the notoriety.
[03:39:08.762 --> 03:39:10.163]  They love getting on TV.
[03:39:10.283 --> 03:39:11.104]  They're nice people.
[03:39:12.225 --> 03:39:15.488]  And, you know, I feel bad that I have to criticize them like this.
[03:39:16.218 --> 03:39:18.019]  But they are not serving the president well.
[03:39:18.239 --> 03:39:20.280]  He needs to turn Fox News off.
[03:39:20.841 --> 03:39:25.703]  He needs to find real independent lawyers that will put their life on the line for him.
[03:39:25.783 --> 03:39:26.864]  Because it's not just for him.
[03:39:27.724 --> 03:39:28.845]  It's for the entire country.
[03:39:30.296 --> 03:39:46.019]  OK, Larry, what is preventing, I guess maybe I watch Fox News too much, what is preventing Trump from simply firing Robert Mueller, firing Rosenstein and firing Jeff Sessions, who's completely useless and just saying, look, they haven't come up with anything.
[03:39:46.059 --> 03:39:48.980]  We need to have an effective Department of Justice.
[03:39:49.100 --> 03:39:50.200]  I'm making these changes.
[03:39:50.920 --> 03:39:52.501]  What prevents him from doing that?
[03:39:53.701 --> 03:39:54.001]  Nothing.
[03:39:54.461 --> 03:39:56.022]  He is the head of the Justice Department.
[03:39:56.662 --> 03:39:58.162]  He's the head of the executive branch.
[03:39:59.065 --> 03:40:05.767]  But short of firing Mueller or Rosenstein, or Sessions for that matter, I think you should get rid of Sessions now, obviously.
[03:40:05.787 --> 03:40:08.787]  I mean, the guy is not the brightest bulb out there.
[03:40:08.807 --> 03:40:12.648]  He even got held in contempt yesterday on something that was unnecessary.
[03:40:12.688 --> 03:40:16.369]  He deported some people who were already under court jurisdiction.
[03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:21.150]  And Judge Emmet Sullivan is holding Sessions in contempt, potentially.
[03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:23.551]  He needs to get somebody in there that's got some guts.
[03:40:24.258 --> 03:40:31.742]  It's got some fortitude that knows what they're doing, and the president can do that, and he can also order the Justice Department to do things.
[03:40:31.782 --> 03:40:43.908]  If he doesn't want to fire Mueller, and if he doesn't want to fire Sessions or Rosenstein, he can order an investigation of Mueller, where the illegal grand jury leaks have been occurring for a year and a half, they're criminal, for
[03:40:45.649 --> 03:40:47.010]  Obstructing justice himself.
[03:40:47.090 --> 03:40:49.812]  That's what he's doing here with Paul Manafort and others.
[03:40:49.852 --> 03:40:51.153]  Larry, what do you think?
[03:40:51.274 --> 03:40:54.836]  Look, we know that Trump has very strong gut instincts.
[03:40:54.917 --> 03:40:58.660]  We know that his gut instinct is, you're fired.
[03:40:58.820 --> 03:41:00.481]  He would fire these guys in a second.
[03:41:00.741 --> 03:41:05.785]  What are his lawyers telling him that are making him think, I can't do this.
[03:41:05.845 --> 03:41:08.768]  I'm going to have a bigger problem if I fire these guys.
[03:41:08.868 --> 03:41:11.790]  What could they possibly be saying?
[03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:15.113]  Yes, that's the $64,000 question when I was a kid on the game show.
[03:41:16.756 --> 03:41:19.298]  Multiplied with inflation, it's a million dollar question.
[03:41:20.379 --> 03:41:26.525]  He's being told by his lawyers, don't do it because it's politically unwise, because it'll result in you getting impeached.
[03:41:26.865 --> 03:41:27.506]  Well, you know what?
[03:41:28.587 --> 03:41:29.828]  He's going to get impeached anyway.
[03:41:30.348 --> 03:41:34.452]  So he might as well get rid of these people now and then take the lumps later.
[03:41:34.492 --> 03:41:35.293]  He is the president.
[03:41:35.373 --> 03:41:36.714]  The American people will back him.
[03:41:37.154 --> 03:41:38.255]  We need strong action.
[03:41:38.716 --> 03:41:40.617]  He needs to take the reins himself.
[03:41:40.717 --> 03:41:43.740]  But these lawyers were part of the swamp in Washington.
[03:41:44.563 --> 03:41:45.764]  They all have lunch together.
[03:41:45.784 --> 03:41:50.187]  Giuliani brags, oh I'm a friend of Mueller, you know, and Sekulow's a nice guy.
[03:41:50.207 --> 03:41:52.048]  And like I said, he's a very good religious rights lawyer.
[03:41:52.108 --> 03:41:54.390]  He really doesn't know what he's doing in the criminal sphere.
[03:41:54.430 --> 03:42:01.115]  Maybe he was a prosecutor or public defender for a very short period of his early life, but he's not a seasoned criminal defense lawyer.
[03:42:01.595 --> 03:42:08.000]  You can't send the president into the devil's lair, have him testify in any respect.
[03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:09.601]  And you can't play these games.
[03:42:10.242 --> 03:42:24.529]  You know, end the investigation, we'll answer limited questions, and then expect Mueller not to issue a scathing and incriminating impeachment report that will grind this country and the President to a halt.
[03:42:24.749 --> 03:42:26.210]  Something has to be done now.
[03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:31.493]  And the President... Larry, we just got a few seconds left.
[03:42:31.533 --> 03:42:35.695]  Tell us where people can go to your website and sign your petition.
[03:42:36.963 --> 03:42:52.757]  Go to freedomwatchusa.org, sign the petition, have me appointed special counsel, but also follow our citizens' grand juries, because we are going to hold the criminals like Mueller, Clinton, Comey, and the rest accountable, and that's the only way we can do it right now.
[03:42:52.797 --> 03:42:53.958]  Larry, we're out of time.
[03:42:53.998 --> 03:42:59.863]  Thank you, Larry Klayman, for being with us, and we'll be right back after the break with Frank Hawkins, Associated Press reporter.
[03:42:59.883 --> 03:43:00.884]  Now!
[03:43:02.865 --> 03:43:04.187]  They think you're a goldfish!
[03:43:05.829 --> 03:43:07.931]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[03:43:08.191 --> 03:43:09.272]  I believe in you!
[03:43:09.692 --> 03:43:10.813]  I don't think you're stupid!
[03:43:12.514 --> 03:43:17.397]  One man ever raped a woman, all genitals were cut off!
[03:43:17.658 --> 03:43:20.079]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:43:20.239 --> 03:43:21.440]  And we're not backing down on her!
[03:43:23.342 --> 03:43:24.502]  I want to get these people!
[03:43:24.542 --> 03:43:25.063]  We're winning!
[03:43:25.123 --> 03:43:26.224]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:43:26.384 --> 03:43:26.844]  Can't you?
[03:43:27.144 --> 03:43:28.765]  We have broken their back!
[03:43:29.126 --> 03:43:30.286]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:43:34.129 --> 03:43:34.670]  Let's go!
[03:43:36.058 --> 03:43:36.478]  Come on!
[03:43:36.498 --> 03:43:36.719]  Come on!
[03:43:36.739 --> 03:43:36.939]  Come on!
[03:43:36.959 --> 03:43:37.199]  Come on!
[03:43:37.279 --> 03:43:37.499]  Come on!
[03:43:37.519 --> 03:43:37.680]  Come on!
[03:43:37.700 --> 03:43:37.980]  Come on!
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:38.160]  Come on!
[03:43:38.240 --> 03:43:38.440]  Come on!
[03:43:38.560 --> 03:43:38.761]  Come on!
[03:43:38.821 --> 03:43:39.021]  Come on!
[03:43:39.041 --> 03:43:39.201]  Come on!

[03:43:56.557 --> 03:43:56.717]  Come on
[03:44:00.902 --> 03:44:03.904]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[03:44:03.964 --> 03:44:04.424]  Go ahead.
[03:44:04.684 --> 03:44:10.267]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[03:44:10.467 --> 03:44:11.548]  I'd done the War Room.
[03:44:11.848 --> 03:44:14.309]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[03:44:14.329 --> 03:44:15.890]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[03:44:15.930 --> 03:44:16.570]  I was exhausted.
[03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:20.152]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[03:44:20.492 --> 03:44:25.135]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[03:44:25.215 --> 03:44:27.196]  Tonight I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[03:44:27.756 --> 03:44:28.056]  Same thing.
[03:44:28.156 --> 03:44:30.037]  I'm going to put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[03:44:30.137 --> 03:44:31.378]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[03:44:31.518 --> 03:44:33.639]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[03:44:33.659 --> 03:44:39.662]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[03:44:39.942 --> 03:44:40.803]  You can sleep with it.
[03:44:41.083 --> 03:44:45.405]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[03:44:45.465 --> 03:44:48.246]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[03:44:48.406 --> 03:44:50.127]  This is the best combination I have found.
[03:44:50.227 --> 03:44:50.928]  It really works.
[03:44:51.148 --> 03:44:55.730]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found, and I've tried them all.
[03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:57.671]  I wasted a lot of money in Whole Foods.
[03:44:57.851 --> 03:44:58.312]  Believe me.
[03:45:00.534 --> 03:45:05.579]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[03:45:05.719 --> 03:45:14.028]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver, that is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[03:45:14.088 --> 03:45:15.469]  It is super silver, wound-free.
[03:45:15.489 --> 03:45:16.150]  We're good to go.
[03:45:36.531 --> 03:45:37.852]  Prescription silver.
[03:45:38.212 --> 03:45:42.614]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[03:45:42.734 --> 03:45:46.196]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[03:45:46.356 --> 03:45:47.616]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[03:45:47.757 --> 03:45:54.620]  I can tell you right now, my dad is a moral surgeon and dentist, and we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals.
[03:45:55.240 --> 03:45:59.662]  And he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[03:45:59.902 --> 03:46:02.724]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-533-139.
[03:46:05.345 --> 03:46:09.289]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff.
[03:46:09.729 --> 03:46:11.851]  I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[03:46:12.392 --> 03:46:16.636]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using in the military, hospitals, you name it.
[03:46:17.016 --> 03:46:17.516]  This is it.
[03:46:17.777 --> 03:46:20.199]  There's only one other silver stronger, and it's by prescription.
[03:46:20.319 --> 03:46:21.980]  This stuff is thermonuclear.
[03:46:22.181 --> 03:46:22.741]  Nanotech.
[03:46:22.921 --> 03:46:26.765]  Super small particles which, going electromagnetically, just goes right to the heart of something.
[03:46:28.394 --> 03:46:38.405]  Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel contains the powerful silver saw technology that revolutionized the colloidal nano silver market.
[03:46:38.586 --> 03:46:49.398]  As the only FDA certified wound treatment product of its kind, this gel has been shown to fight infection and irritation while also helping
[03:46:49.758 --> 03:46:51.359]  Speed up the healing process.
[03:46:51.520 --> 03:46:53.721]  And that's the way I like it.
[03:46:53.781 --> 03:46:59.927]  Grab a bottle of Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel right now at Infowarslife.com.
[03:47:03.169 --> 03:47:05.792]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.671 --> 03:47:26.556]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:47:27.057 --> 03:47:28.458]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:33.903 --> 03:47:38.725]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, still on the air, still fighting the forces of censorship and evil.
[03:47:39.345 --> 03:47:43.906]  I'm Joel Gilbert, doing this last hour from the People's Republic of California.
[03:47:44.327 --> 03:47:45.347]  Do not go away.
[03:47:45.427 --> 03:47:53.350]  Stay tuned, because you need to go over to Alex Jones' Twitter account, right at the top of the hour, at RealAlexJones.
[03:47:53.850 --> 03:47:56.591]  Alex is continuing the show with a special broadcast.
[03:47:57.331 --> 03:48:02.573]  Go to AlexJones at RealAlexJones.com on Twitter, right after this show at the top of the hour.
[03:48:03.619 --> 03:48:12.669]  I want to bring on now a very special guest and friend of mine, an old school reporter, Associated Press reporter, worldwide correspondent, former U.S.
[03:48:12.709 --> 03:48:15.412]  intelligence officer, Frank Hawkins.
[03:48:15.572 --> 03:48:16.813]  Frank Hawkins is with us.
[03:48:17.494 --> 03:48:22.039]  He just wrote an amazing article on American Thinker that went viral.
[03:48:22.559 --> 03:48:23.400]  Frank, are you with us?
[03:48:24.301 --> 03:48:24.721]  I'm here.
[03:48:24.962 --> 03:48:25.522]  Hello, Joel.
[03:48:25.582 --> 03:48:26.083]  How are you doing?
[03:48:27.136 --> 03:48:28.136]  Okay, great to hear from you.
[03:48:28.176 --> 03:48:36.198]  This is a real treat to let everybody hear from a real reporter, the old school reporters who traveled the world, told the truth, and did not have an agenda.
[03:48:36.918 --> 03:48:44.700]  Now, Frank wrote an article called, The Top Ten Most Destructive Americans of My Eight Decades.
[03:48:44.800 --> 03:48:48.161]  The Top Ten Most Destructive Americans on American Thinker.
[03:48:48.201 --> 03:48:50.002]  This thing went viral through the roof.
[03:48:50.622 --> 03:48:54.703]  If we can pull up the American Thinker article, people can get a sense of what it's about.
[03:48:55.792 --> 03:49:00.996]  And what I wanted to do is go ahead and have you tell us why you wrote this piece, and then we'll go through them all, Frank.
[03:49:01.036 --> 03:49:03.438]  Why did you write about the 10 most destructive Americans?
[03:49:04.178 --> 03:49:05.459]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[03:49:05.559 --> 03:49:08.542]  I, as I, obviously in my eighth decade, I'm pushing 80.
[03:49:08.742 --> 03:49:16.367]  I'm not quite there yet, but over all these years, I've witnessed an unbelievable makeover of America.
[03:49:17.108 --> 03:49:19.870]  Now, admittedly, some of it's been good.
[03:49:20.290 --> 03:49:23.733]  You know, we have enjoyed impressive improvements in our standard of living.
[03:49:25.049 --> 03:49:29.851]  For instance, when I was a boy, we lived in what was considered a middle-class neighborhood.
[03:49:30.492 --> 03:49:31.852]  Our house had one bathroom.
[03:49:32.552 --> 03:49:33.653]  The family had one car.
[03:49:33.673 --> 03:49:34.913]  There was no TV.
[03:49:35.494 --> 03:49:38.675]  We did have radio and rotary dial phones.
[03:49:40.096 --> 03:49:51.781]  But basically, very few at that time, Joel, could even envision space travel or iPhones or iPads or Facebook or a live-streaming, high-definition TV 24 hours a day.
[03:49:53.522 --> 03:49:56.443]  Although, Dick Tracy did have a telephone on his wrist.
[03:49:56.863 --> 03:50:02.104]  Anyhow, the other thing, which is more important, we had a government that we respected.
[03:50:02.864 --> 03:50:08.226]  And we believed that that government generally acted in the interests of the American people.
[03:50:09.046 --> 03:50:15.927]  And the media in those days, known as the Fourth Estate, and by the way, my father was a newspaper editor in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[03:50:16.688 --> 03:50:22.069]  The Fourth Estate was widely trusted to help set the political agenda and provide balance
[03:50:23.183 --> 03:50:24.744]  In our political system.
[03:50:24.824 --> 03:50:27.866]  My father wrote editorials for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
[03:50:28.266 --> 03:50:31.388]  I regard him as the most ethical person I've ever known.
[03:50:32.089 --> 03:50:36.852]  And in those days, Joel, there were no liberal or right-wing newspapers.
[03:50:37.692 --> 03:50:43.255]  Although, obviously, newspaper editorials would make recommendations at election time.
[03:50:43.876 --> 03:50:46.858]  But often they would recommend both Republicans and Democrats.
[03:50:47.378 --> 03:50:50.420]  With the idea being that, you know, you just vote for the best person.
[03:50:51.235 --> 03:50:53.395]  Not for a particular party.
[03:50:54.276 --> 03:51:08.459]  And even when TV finally matured, you know, the initial evening talk show hosts like Johnny Carson and so on, they were usually even-handed in their jokes about politicians, and frankly, they were very rarely vicious.
[03:51:09.499 --> 03:51:10.539]  So let's talk about when the
[03:51:14.807 --> 03:51:23.772]  The tide changed and who were the people that changed the tide to change this more balanced society where government was respected and newspapers were fair?
[03:51:24.493 --> 03:51:25.093]  Who do you think?
[03:51:26.794 --> 03:51:39.121]  I've got a list of 10 people and arguably there are plenty of others who could or should be on the list, but I have my top 10 and I will start with the at the bottom of the list is the guy named Mark Felt.
[03:51:40.002 --> 03:51:40.642]  At that time,
[03:51:41.511 --> 03:51:51.555]  When he was in the FBI during the Nixon era, he was the deputy director of the FBI, and he ended up being Deep Throat during the Watergate scandal.
[03:51:52.475 --> 03:52:06.561]  This, Joel, was the first public instance of a senior FBI official directly interfering in Americans' political affairs, and he is the forerunner of Comey, Strzok, Lisa Page, and Andrew McCabe.
[03:52:08.041 --> 03:52:10.323]  Okay, let's jump up to Ted Kennedy.
[03:52:10.523 --> 03:52:16.088]  What did this liberal icon and Kennedy brother do to bring about destruction to America?
[03:52:16.988 --> 03:52:23.033]  Kennedy, everybody will remember as the guy who left Mary Jo Kopechny to die at Chappaquiddick.
[03:52:23.714 --> 03:52:31.200]  But the real damage that he caused after he avoided punishment for her death and became a major force in the U.S.
[03:52:31.220 --> 03:52:36.444]  Senate as a Democrat, he pushing through transformative liberal policies in both
[03:52:37.130 --> 03:52:37.410]  Okay, let's...
[03:52:59.298 --> 03:53:02.100]  Alright, let's take Icahn, Walter Cronkite.
[03:53:02.120 --> 03:53:03.081]  You put him on the list.
[03:53:03.161 --> 03:53:08.245]  How did Walter Cronkite, the much-beloved network anchor, bring about destruction?
[03:53:09.426 --> 03:53:14.609]  People of my era will remember that Walter Cronkite was a totally beloved figure.
[03:53:14.730 --> 03:53:16.151]  And I was one of those who loved him.
[03:53:16.231 --> 03:53:20.654]  I mean, he cried when John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
[03:53:21.054 --> 03:53:24.357]  He gave a remarkable performance when the men landed on the moon.
[03:53:24.977 --> 03:53:25.958]  And everybody loved him.
[03:53:26.434 --> 03:53:41.340]  But in fact, what happened was that he had this famous broadcast from Vietnam that described the Tet Offensive as a major victory for the communists, and it significantly turned the gullible American public against the Vietnam War.
[03:53:42.001 --> 03:53:47.703]  In fact, you'll remember the Tet Offensive was a military disaster for the communists.
[03:53:48.363 --> 03:53:52.965]  And this was later admitted by the North Vietnamese military leaders themselves.
[03:53:53.585 --> 03:53:54.886]  And even years later,
[03:53:55.522 --> 03:53:58.725]  Cronkite admitted that he got the story wrong, but it was too late.
[03:53:59.085 --> 03:53:59.965]  The damage was done.
[03:54:00.786 --> 03:54:05.530]  So that was the original, one of the original fake news pieces that caused tremendous damage.
[03:54:05.970 --> 03:54:09.993]  Let's jump up to Jimmy Carter, known for his incompetence.
[03:54:10.293 --> 03:54:14.736]  What stands out as most destructive act of Jimmy Carter?
[03:54:15.417 --> 03:54:21.922]  Well, there were a couple, but I would think the one that we would just have time to talk about today was that Jimmy Carter can easily be
[03:54:22.863 --> 03:54:27.907]  Uh, thought about as the guy who ignited modern-day radical Islam.
[03:54:28.747 --> 03:54:36.553]  And the way he did that was he abandoned the Shah, who in those days in Iran was the head of what amounted to a secular country.
[03:54:36.973 --> 03:54:44.999]  Yes, people were largely Muslims, but in fact it was a secular country and everyone, all religions were treated with respect.
[03:54:47.111 --> 03:54:57.340]  Carter ended up pulling out the rug from underneath the shawl, and he paved the way for the Ayatollah Khomeini to come from Paris and to take power in Tehran.
[03:54:58.201 --> 03:55:06.148]  As a result, subsequently, Iran became the main state sponsor and promoter of international Islamic terrorism.
[03:55:06.828 --> 03:55:11.773]  And you know, when the Islamic forces took over our embassy in Tehran,
[03:55:12.463 --> 03:55:20.088]  Carter was too weak to do anything about it, and he basically strengthened the rule of the radical Islamic mullahs, and they're still in power today.
[03:55:20.108 --> 03:55:22.309]  Let's keep moving, because we've got a little too much time.
[03:55:22.329 --> 03:55:33.676]  We're going to jump up to, you know, Barry, Barack, Davis, Sotoro, Hussein, Obama, the stealth communist that I've criticized, of course, in my movie, Dreams from My Real Father.
[03:55:34.415 --> 03:55:38.639]  Why did Barack Hussein Obama, how did he bring destruction to America?
[03:55:38.659 --> 03:55:44.865]  Well, you know, each day we learn more about how he politicized and compromised key government agencies.
[03:55:45.226 --> 03:55:48.168]  You know, particularly the FBI, the CIA, and the IRS.
[03:55:48.609 --> 03:55:57.638]  And the damage is that he has thoroughly shaken the public's confidence in the federal government to be fair and unbiased in its activities.
[03:55:58.158 --> 03:56:09.508]  But even worse than that, in my opinion, is he could significantly set back race and other relations between Americans by stoking black grievances and pushing radical identity politics.
[03:56:10.269 --> 03:56:20.498]  And on top of that, of course, his open support for the Iranian mullahs and his apologetic lead from behind foreign policy seriously weakened America abroad.
[03:56:21.299 --> 03:56:23.881]  No, we can do, Frank, we can do a whole show.
[03:56:24.995 --> 03:56:26.976]  We could do a whole show on Obama, no question.
[03:56:27.016 --> 03:56:31.938]  I want to make sure we get to the number one most destructive American I want to hear you talk about.
[03:56:31.998 --> 03:56:35.920]  You listed him as John Kerry, former Secretary of State.
[03:56:36.460 --> 03:56:39.362]  Why is John Kerry the most destructive American of your lifetime?
[03:56:40.482 --> 03:56:46.425]  You know, sensible people could argue about his place on the list, whether he deserves to be number one.
[03:56:46.945 --> 03:56:52.468]  I put him on there because I regard him as the most single, most despicable American who ever lived.
[03:56:53.035 --> 03:56:59.017]  You know, after he faked his three purple hearts during his service in Vietnam, he was able to leave the Navy early.
[03:56:59.397 --> 03:57:10.300]  And as a reserve naval officer, in clear violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, he traveled to Paris and he met privately with the NVA and the Viet Cong.
[03:57:10.801 --> 03:57:15.002]  And then he came back to the United States parroting the Soviet Party line about the war.
[03:57:15.856 --> 03:57:22.599]  And he had the gall to testify before Congress in which he had compared American soldiers to the hordes of Genghis Khan.
[03:57:23.020 --> 03:57:25.581]  He became a virtual spokesman for the communists.
[03:57:25.981 --> 03:57:28.422]  It was a clear case, Joel, of treason.
[03:57:28.802 --> 03:57:31.924]  That is, giving aid and comfort to the enemy in a time of war.
[03:57:32.464 --> 03:57:37.127]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:58:01.457 --> 03:58:04.818]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[03:58:05.239 --> 03:58:13.622]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:58:13.982 --> 03:58:18.204]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:58:18.544 --> 03:58:19.424]  You are the info warrior.
[03:58:19.985 --> 03:58:23.506]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:58:25.401 --> 03:58:25.681]  We're good.
[03:58:46.255 --> 03:58:46.475]  I think?
