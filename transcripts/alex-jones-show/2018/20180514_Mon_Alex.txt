[00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.471]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:27.898]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.938 --> 00:00:31.941]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 14th day of May 2018.
[00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:35.204]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:39.847]  And then Roger Stone and Owen Schroer are going to knock it out of the park yet again.
[00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:49.147]  We've got 43 dead, thousands injured in Islamicist rioting outside of Israel.
[00:00:50.068 --> 00:00:50.809]  And that's what it is.
[00:00:53.191 --> 00:01:01.378]  Doesn't mean I don't feel for some of those people locked out of all the other Muslim countries, who won't take a single one of them, but only blame Israel.
[00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:03.019]  It's just not reality-based.
[00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.520]  And I'm gonna break it all down.
[00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:06.322]  Jared Kushner can speak.
[00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:07.383]  He actually talks.
[00:01:07.443 --> 00:01:08.824]  He says Trump's kept his promises.
[00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:14.364]  Amazing footage, drones dropping tear gas on people.
[00:01:14.404 --> 00:01:16.045]  I remember I told folks about that 10 years ago.
[00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:18.025]  They said it was a conspiracy theory, but now it's all there.
[00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:24.368]  But first, a John Bowne report, because we have to understand where leftist ideology takes us 1,000% of the time.
[00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:42.625]  California, with its bankrupt economy, culture of unemployment, madcap representatives, crumbling power grid, crippling taxes, and unattainable real estate prices, has created an exodus of Californians heading east.
[00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:47.167]  But California has always claimed to be at the heart of the American future.
[00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:49.087]  So why is everyone leaving?
[00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:50.608]  Curbed, reports
[00:01:50.908 --> 00:02:05.417]  California is seeing a net gain in high earners, making $110,000 or more, and the highly educated, graduate degrees or higher, while losing those representing the other end of the socioeconomic spectrum.
[00:02:05.617 --> 00:02:07.759]  Families with kids are headed for Texas.
[00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.280]  Blue State College graduates are moving in.
[00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:15.824]  In other words, California is experiencing what looks like statewide gentrification.
[00:02:16.064 --> 00:02:25.589]  Maybe it's also because of the leftist madness gleaned from reports like these, as the LA Times asked, is systematic racism to blame for STDs?
[00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.834]  They write, poverty or lack of opportunity may be forcing women to exchange sex for resources, leading to the spread of STDs.
[00:02:33.994 --> 00:02:40.238]  There also tends to be a mistrust of the medical system among African Americans, making them reluctant to seek care.
[00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:40.918]  Lately,
[00:02:41.318 --> 00:02:45.503]  Scapegoating racism has been the Trojan horse for all of society's ills.
[00:02:45.663 --> 00:02:53.993]  What else could explain as the Washington Times reported over half of Americans now live in sanctuaries protecting illegal non-taxpaying immigrants.
[00:02:54.313 --> 00:03:00.080]  And as the wealth gap increases, is this what you can expect coming soon to a city near you?
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.341]  New at 5, we have shocking video of what's going on in one of the busiest BART stations in the Bay Area.
[00:03:06.901 --> 00:03:10.322]  Several junkies blatantly shooting up out in the open.
[00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:12.443]  Others slumped along the corridors.
[00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:15.603]  This is San Francisco's Civic Center station.
[00:03:15.764 --> 00:03:21.685]  We sent KPIX 5's Wilson Walker to ask the mayor and BART, what are you doing about all of this?
[00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:24.029]  You can see there's dozens of them.
[00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.654]  Needles everywhere, crack, heroin.
[00:03:27.014 --> 00:03:30.240]  It's a real concern for our riders and we appreciate that.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.388]  What we have to do is make the most of the resources, the limited resources that we have.
[00:03:37.225 --> 00:03:46.149]  BART, which has been pledging to address these problems, says it's recruiting more community service officers, more than 30 new sworn officers, and 20 new station cleaners.
[00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.010]  But will that be enough?
[00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:57.174]  If San Francisco spends nearly a quarter of a billion dollars on the homeless every year, why are there still thousands of people living on the street?
[00:03:57.394 --> 00:03:58.635]  Where does that money go?
[00:03:58.815 --> 00:04:00.395]  And how does the system work?
[00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:01.456]  Or not work?
[00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:04.518]  241 million dollars.
[00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:10.822]  Now, of that, 50 million funds shelters and another 50 million fund health services for the truly homeless.
[00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:22.070]  But the single most important thing to know about that 241 million dollars is that most of it has absolutely nothing to do with the people we see on the streets.
[00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.412]  That is a great observation.
[00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:26.693]  I think it's missed by many in the city.
[00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:32.518]  We're not spending $241 million a year on the 7 or 8,000 people who are homeless in San Francisco.
[00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:38.122]  We're spending more than half of that money actually to keep people in permanent housing.
[00:04:38.442 --> 00:04:45.685]  That's right, $140 million worth of the entire homeless budget houses approximately 9,000 people.
[00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:50.146]  California should be the prime example of what not to do.
[00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.768]  John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:59.210]  We'll be back on this Live Monday Global Transmission.
[00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.191]  Please spread all the live links and tell folks about your local station.
[00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:07.656]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:14.622]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google, they have filed 13 lawsuits, we've beaten six.
[00:05:14.923 --> 00:05:19.066]  But understand this, I am your soldier, you're my soldier, we're all in this together.
[00:05:20.137 --> 00:05:24.820]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.220]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:37.427]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com, org slash show, local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.

[00:05:53.575 --> 00:05:59.078]  The very best supplements, water filtration, air filtration, shortwave radios, emergency radios, tactical gear, body armor.
[00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:01.679]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.260]  Please shop with the good guys.
[00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:20.780]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[00:06:36.323 --> 00:06:56.648]  You know, I've had the Islamist groups, I've had the white supremacists, I've had the Hollywood crowd, I've had mainstream media bully me for 20 plus years that I've been on air with litmus tests about, do I support Israel or don't I?
[00:06:57.748 --> 00:07:01.069]  And I've been very, very clear that I do support Israel.
[00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.470]  There's videos on YouTube
[00:07:06.442 --> 00:07:08.683]  That have been re-uploaded, where I said that in 1997.
[00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:16.766]  And the reason I do, is very simple.
[00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:35.434]  None of the Muslim countries, like Egypt, or Jordan, or Saudi Arabia, that surround the Palestinian lands, close quote,
[00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:38.958]  We'll take any of them.
[00:07:39.578 --> 00:07:42.479]  And I've gone and looked at the demographics of most of those people.
[00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:54.461]  They're basically nomadic groups that have come into the area as part of a hajj or part of some type of jihad.
[00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:56.982]  Now let's explain this.
[00:08:00.683 --> 00:08:02.383]  Israel's this little bitty tiny country.
[00:08:07.677 --> 00:08:09.839]  All around it are these Muslim countries.
[00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:19.165]  And if you look at maps going back a hundred years ago, time-lapse through today, big magazines have done them, TV stations have done them, news programs have done them.
[00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:28.132]  They generally show Islam spreading as green, because that's the color of Islam, and you see it expanding, never contracting.
[00:08:30.173 --> 00:08:33.876]  And you've got one point almost four billion.
[00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:40.541]  Muslims having six children on average, that means three billion by 2030.
[00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:40.541]  2030.
[00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:46.465]  So within about 12 years.
[00:08:47.366 --> 00:08:49.787]  Hard to believe 2030 is only 12 years away.
[00:08:49.928 --> 00:08:51.148]  Wow, isn't that incredible?
[00:08:52.189 --> 00:08:53.330]  We're living in the future here.
[00:08:57.273 --> 00:09:20.721]  And the left and the globalists have allied themselves with radical Islam, and they've backed the takeover of non-radical Islam, and persecute Muslims, and then persecute Christians, and persecute animists, and persecute Zoroastrians, and Hindus, and Buddhists, and atheists, and straight, and gay.
[00:09:22.502 --> 00:09:24.783]  All over the world, Islam comes in, sets up,
[00:09:26.226 --> 00:09:32.367]  And then once it hits about 20%, it does not tolerate anybody else.
[00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:35.948]  In fact, it doesn't tolerate more moderate Islamic groups.
[00:09:36.728 --> 00:09:38.048]  It's a scourge.
[00:09:38.689 --> 00:09:43.409]  And you read the WikiLeaks from two years ago, Jerusalem Post even had a report on it.
[00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:55.012]  Boy, the Israeli media is just as leftist as ours, tries to cover stuff up, that George Soros basically wants to break up Israel and end it.
[00:09:55.692 --> 00:09:56.112]  Get rid of it.
[00:09:59.793 --> 00:10:01.834]  What are you going to do with those millions of Jews that are there?
[00:10:01.854 --> 00:10:03.755]  Just push them into the ocean like Iran says?
[00:10:06.095 --> 00:10:15.839]  And you've got the 13th tribe, you know, Kessler arguments that have been proven not to be completely accurate and say, well most of them are European Jews so they don't really have some genetic background.
[00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:16.720]  Oh yes they do.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.781]  It may be a small genetic background but it doesn't even matter.
[00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:25.243]  Jews were there thousands of years ago and the idea that the whole Middle East can't have any Jews in it
[00:10:26.585 --> 00:10:29.827]  Is the exact same idea that you can't be any Christians!
[00:10:31.347 --> 00:10:31.888]  Except where?
[00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.128]  Syria and Iraq.
[00:10:34.249 --> 00:10:34.709]  And Egypt.
[00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.150]  And Libya.
[00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:52.157]  And what did Barack Hussein Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, who wears his little Islam ring, with Arabic on it, and the first foreign speech he gave was in Cairo,
[00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:54.960]  It's like he's an imam.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.942]  He speaks Arabic perfectly.
[00:11:02.387 --> 00:11:05.089]  There is no place for Christians all over the world.
[00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.693]  From Indonesia to Nigeria.
[00:11:10.194 --> 00:11:11.175]  Black Christians.
[00:11:12.536 --> 00:11:14.078]  Black Ethiopian Christians.
[00:11:14.498 --> 00:11:15.659]  Sudanese Christians.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.981]  In countries that were
[00:11:19.097 --> 00:11:26.162]  95% Christian, just a hundred years ago, the Christians are being completely pushed out and slaughtered.
[00:11:28.003 --> 00:11:29.024]  So here's the coup de grace.
[00:11:33.647 --> 00:11:38.190]  I don't say these things about Israel to curry favor with the anti-Israel crowd.
[00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.692]  I say it because I like to give a full-spectrum analysis.
[00:11:42.094 --> 00:11:50.877]  I don't like some of the globalist and leftist groups that basically use Israel as a place to launder money and to manipulate influence and to escape criminal actions here in the U.S.
[00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:57.919]  I don't like some of the leftist Israel lobbying involved in anti-gun movements here in the U.S.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.921]  when they are handing out M16s and Uzis to their people, which they should.
[00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:05.061]  I got issues with Israel.
[00:12:07.722 --> 00:12:09.823]  But Israel's a diverse political system.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:19.641]  Israel is not expanding and telling me I can't have a church on my street.
[00:12:20.182 --> 00:12:23.402]  Israel is not telling me that my children have to submit to Allah.
[00:12:24.363 --> 00:12:28.944]  Israel is not spreading like a virus.
[00:12:32.724 --> 00:12:39.666]  And George Soros, my enemy, the guy trying to destroy me, trying to overthrow this country, the Nazi collaborator,
[00:12:41.192 --> 00:12:54.523]  No matter how many newspapers and publications he pays to call himself a Holocaust survivor, he went on 60 Minutes, and he wrote a book, and so did his dad, bragging how they helped round up thousands of Jews, saying it was the best time of their life, and they'd do it all over again.
[00:12:54.543 --> 00:12:57.186]  Do I have to play 60 Minutes for you again?
[00:12:59.207 --> 00:13:06.394]  He's after me, and they basically told me, in the lawsuits and in the news, stop doing this.
[00:13:06.614 --> 00:13:07.675]  I will never stop.
[00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:12.331]  You may be able to intimidate and push other people around, buddy.
[00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:13.712]  You're not pushing me around.
[00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.998]  So, it's called choosing a side.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.522]  And there's big money behind being anti-Israel.
[00:13:30.923 --> 00:13:37.308]  I didn't even try to appease the anti-Israel crowd when I made a film
[00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:44.749]  about the USS Liberty and concluded it was a false flag between Israel and LBJ to start a war.
[00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.470]  LBJ done false flags before.
[00:13:48.331 --> 00:13:56.975]  It made the anti-Israel crowd even madder saying I wasn't a pure Jew hater and I wasn't pure like them and all of their BS.
[00:13:58.495 --> 00:14:05.639]  I put that film out because if I'm going to expose false flags that is an interesting and important one to make and I interviewed Admiral Moore
[00:14:06.684 --> 00:14:09.766]  Who was the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman and others before he died.
[00:14:09.786 --> 00:14:16.149]  And I interviewed the head Judge Advocate General on the case to actually find out what happened 20 years ago.
[00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:24.494]  Before your average anti-Israel person even knew about the Liberty, I'd had dozens of guests on about it.
[00:14:24.734 --> 00:14:25.835]  But that isn't the issue.
[00:14:26.135 --> 00:14:30.358]  It's like if the US government does something evil or bad, is every administration evil?
[00:14:30.878 --> 00:14:32.039]  Is our whole government bad?
[00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:32.299]  No.
[00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:53.706]  So, all the bullying over the years, all the anti-Israel stuff, all of it is all part of a larger globalist UN Sorosian program, and the Vatican is heavily involved, and they want the UN to come in and take over that holy city.
[00:14:55.668 --> 00:14:57.049]  Talk about bringing in Revelation.
[00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:02.175]  You know, maybe I just don't want Revelation to come in that quick.
[00:15:02.215 --> 00:15:03.216]  I got a one-year-old daughter.
[00:15:03.257 --> 00:15:04.398]  I got three other children I love.
[00:15:04.898 --> 00:15:13.028]  Maybe I just don't like seeing it fulfilled to have the Babylon whore and the false prophet in control of Jerusalem.
[00:15:14.554 --> 00:15:18.697]  Maybe just at a deep level, I don't like the UN taking control of Israel.
[00:15:19.057 --> 00:15:19.798]  Because that's the thing.
[00:15:19.838 --> 00:15:22.760]  That's who's going to take it over, and then they're going to start even bigger wars.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.522]  You'll never satisfy the so-called Palestinians.
[00:15:25.922 --> 00:15:27.724]  The Arab countries won't take one of them.
[00:15:27.764 --> 00:15:28.464]  What does that tell you?
[00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:31.366]  Because everywhere you take them in, they try to overthrow you.
[00:15:31.547 --> 00:15:32.687]  It's what they do.
[00:15:33.248 --> 00:15:41.414]  And the suicide bombings with their kids, and all of this crud, and the fact that they're invading our countries, and the globalists are bringing them in,
[00:15:43.254 --> 00:15:58.883]  To our nations, and telling us we've got a red carpet to them, and I've got articles here where they're telling churches take down their steeples, take down their crosses in Germany, that you can't have your church bells going at half the decimals of the call to prayer, but the call to prayer can happen.
[00:15:59.183 --> 00:16:00.764]  Christians are under attack!
[00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:03.812]  Alpha Power.
[00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:04.973]  Here's what you want to know.
[00:16:05.213 --> 00:16:11.179]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.363]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[00:16:16.263 --> 00:16:24.207]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[00:16:24.748 --> 00:16:31.792]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[00:16:32.352 --> 00:16:34.033]  It just has a little bit in it.
[00:16:34.433 --> 00:16:39.536]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[00:16:39.816 --> 00:16:43.158]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in.
[00:16:43.678 --> 00:16:48.121]  And you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:49.562]  Nobody else does that.
[00:16:49.642 --> 00:16:52.344]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[00:16:52.705 --> 00:16:54.726]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.

[00:17:13.423 --> 00:17:19.689]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:17:21.451 --> 00:17:27.796]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[00:19:05.865 --> 00:19:07.286]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:07.326 --> 00:19:08.766]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:08.826 --> 00:19:09.187]  Go ahead.
[00:19:09.307 --> 00:19:09.587]  Yes.
[00:19:10.007 --> 00:19:10.747]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:10.847 --> 00:19:17.050]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.232]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:21.472 --> 00:19:22.913]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:30.216]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it like
[00:19:30.496 --> 00:19:33.137]  I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:33.197 --> 00:19:36.619]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:38.500]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:46.364]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:19:46.384 --> 00:19:52.227]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Coil Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:52.347 --> 00:19:53.828]  It is our highest reviewed product.
[00:19:54.048 --> 00:19:57.672]  Because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high quality colloidal silver.
[00:19:57.732 --> 00:20:00.754]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[00:20:05.899 --> 00:20:08.522]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:25.063 --> 00:20:25.944]  You found it!
[00:20:26.384 --> 00:20:28.025]  The tip of the spear!
[00:20:28.345 --> 00:20:31.067]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:33.949 --> 00:20:39.373]  So if you look at what goes on in Israel, there's different administrations, there's different policies.
[00:20:39.794 --> 00:20:50.321]  You've got political assassinations, you've got Orthodox Jews and the super, you know, Orthodox Hasidic Jews, and you've got, you know, the worldly socialist Jews that move there, and then all the other people that move there.
[00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:52.663]  There's dozens of groups
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:04.448]  But there's a litmus test in liberal media, there's a litmus test in Hollywood, there's a litmus test with George Soros, there's a litmus test with the radical Islamic groups of hating Israel.
[00:21:05.769 --> 00:21:16.158]  But never looking at the mass murder Hillary and Obama caused by funding the Arab Spring and overthrowing non-radical regimes and our allies and putting radical Islam in.
[00:21:17.419 --> 00:21:20.021]  There are different maps of it that universities have put out, but if you
[00:21:21.104 --> 00:21:23.865]  Type in the Spread of Islam Worldwide Map.
[00:21:24.165 --> 00:21:29.567]  You'll get a lot of different variants and versions, and you'll see that Islam is expanding.
[00:21:31.488 --> 00:21:33.588]  Islam is not contracting.
[00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:36.710]  Christianity is contracting.
[00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.150]  Capitalism is contracting.
[00:21:39.511 --> 00:21:41.591]  Prosperity is contracting.
[00:21:43.132 --> 00:21:49.074]  And when Islam takes over your country, it doesn't let you continue
[00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:52.565]  To be free.
[00:21:56.307 --> 00:21:58.268]  All it does is expand.
[00:21:59.309 --> 00:22:04.571]  There are countries that are currently Islamic and there are countries that are currently not Islamic.
[00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:06.932]  There is the House of Islam.
[00:22:07.853 --> 00:22:09.033]  There is the House of War.
[00:22:11.374 --> 00:22:18.298]  Islam is already in control of most European countries because they're parliamentary with more than 10 parties per country.
[00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:21.740]  You get 10-15% that vote in a block?
[00:22:22.621 --> 00:22:24.803]  You have checkmate control!
[00:22:25.683 --> 00:22:26.164]  Already!
[00:22:30.227 --> 00:22:32.229]  Understand that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:35.732]  There's a devastating world map.
[00:22:35.752 --> 00:22:39.415]  If you're a radio listener, InfoWars.com, Ford's live show, you can go see this for yourself.
[00:22:41.176 --> 00:22:43.718]  But this is the reality.
[00:22:48.142 --> 00:22:48.282]  Now,
[00:22:51.991 --> 00:22:53.212]  Does that mean Israel's perfect?
[00:22:53.392 --> 00:22:54.252]  Absolutely not.
[00:22:56.193 --> 00:23:04.418]  Does that mean that Netanyahu has been caught, along with Obama, funding ISIS and Al-Qaeda as one of the warring groups trying to bring down Syria?
[00:23:04.578 --> 00:23:06.299]  And I get the Machiavellian view.
[00:23:07.379 --> 00:23:13.162]  Well, Syria's been our enemy for 50 years, and if we can take out Assad, we're not going to let Al-Qaeda stay in charge.
[00:23:13.202 --> 00:23:15.063]  We'll obviously then put another regime in.
[00:23:15.643 --> 00:23:18.645]  What, after ISIS and Al-Qaeda kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people?
[00:23:19.025 --> 00:23:20.026]  That's wrong, BB!
[00:23:24.138 --> 00:23:29.221]  But I say that from a position of moral authority, in that I don't hate Netanyahu, because he's a Jew.
[00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:32.662]  And I don't think Netanyahu overall is a bad guy.
[00:23:32.682 --> 00:23:35.564]  I think he really believes in Israel as a hard-working, focused person.
[00:23:37.885 --> 00:23:40.826]  But he's got blinders on for Israel, and that's what he's elected to do.
[00:23:42.147 --> 00:23:44.208]  And the globals are trying to take him out of office, just like Trump.
[00:23:44.788 --> 00:23:45.489]  But I'll say this.
[00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:49.191]  Trump is a leader.
[00:23:49.671 --> 00:23:51.572]  And Netanyahu said that, and it's absolutely true.
[00:23:52.452 --> 00:23:53.233]  Trump is a leader.
[00:23:54.076 --> 00:23:55.677]  This is called leadership, folks.
[00:23:55.697 --> 00:24:04.700]  This is called not doing the same thing, beating your head up against a wall for 50 years in a failed peace deal, while the Palestinians sit across the fence having six kids on average.
[00:24:05.521 --> 00:24:11.863]  And not one Arab country will take them, because they use them, that big lake of humanity, as a weapons system.
[00:24:12.004 --> 00:24:16.425]  Incredible footage I saw today of Israel dropping tear gas on people from drones.
[00:24:17.306 --> 00:24:17.846]  Can we roll that?
[00:24:17.866 --> 00:24:18.546]  It was on CNN.
[00:24:19.527 --> 00:24:22.528]  And I remember seeing that,
[00:24:25.356 --> 00:24:37.640]  And I just remember being criticized 10 years ago saying, oh look, this company's selling drones to drop tear gas and fire weapons, including hand grenades.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.661]  And the media attacked me and said, Jones is insane.
[00:24:41.141 --> 00:24:45.063]  There's no plan to use drones to surveil rural property.
[00:24:45.123 --> 00:24:47.584]  There's no plans to put weapons on them or tear gas.
[00:24:48.484 --> 00:24:50.945]  And I remember it was in over a thousand newspapers.
[00:24:52.313 --> 00:24:56.795]  It was the first time I was really hit with a full disinformation pitch.
[00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:01.157]  And all I was doing was reading out of regional newspapers.
[00:25:01.817 --> 00:25:03.798]  But they didn't want to have a national debate about that.
[00:25:04.318 --> 00:25:05.939]  It's just so funny, it's like Jade Helm.
[00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:10.760]  It was in the Houston Chronicle, the Austin American Statesman, the Miami Herald, it was in so many papers I can't even keep track of it.
[00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:19.764]  That Alex Jones is run by Russian bots, and the Russian bots said that the military was going to invade Texas in 2015, called Jade Helm.
[00:25:20.825 --> 00:25:21.785]  I never said any of that.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.101]  I'm going to cover some of that later.
[00:25:24.521 --> 00:25:26.623]  I said, look, it says Texas is hostile.
[00:25:27.524 --> 00:25:31.508]  This is part of conditioning the military for martial law if Obama ever wants it.
[00:25:31.829 --> 00:25:44.962]  And then we got the document last year where Soros' son was funding trying to create martial law all over the country with anti-police riots to trigger civil unrest so Obama could have martial law.
[00:25:46.377 --> 00:25:52.040]  So there I was saying Obama is funding the Justice Department to try to trigger race war.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.621]  Now we have the documents proving it.
[00:25:54.922 --> 00:26:02.906]  And Obama had the military out running around doing this training for overseas and domestically to condition the public.
[00:26:04.087 --> 00:26:06.568]  And why do you think I knew that back at the time?
[00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.730]  It wasn't Russian bots.
[00:26:10.571 --> 00:26:14.393]  I was told that by the army officers that were involved.
[00:26:16.613 --> 00:26:24.758]  That they supported what we were doing, they understood the media was putting out disinfo, that it was lies, that they were coming to bring in martial law.
[00:26:25.038 --> 00:26:25.879]  We never said that.
[00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:28.160]  We said, look, it has Texas listed as hostile.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:41.048]  If you read the internal documents that were later released, it said to master the human domain and track everyone in live time using their cell phones, their social security numbers, their Facebook, their Twitter.
[00:26:42.472 --> 00:26:46.133]  And it was a practiced invasion of U.S.
[00:26:46.173 --> 00:26:48.294]  cities under Obama.
[00:26:51.395 --> 00:26:56.217]  But they used the PSYOP up front when I said, oh, look, this is training to take over America.
[00:26:56.758 --> 00:26:58.098]  Our own military was telling me this.
[00:26:58.878 --> 00:27:02.700]  They spun it and said, Jones says this summer they're invading and they'll take your guns.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.720]  There's no video.
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.741]  There's no text.
[00:27:05.001 --> 00:27:05.881]  There's no article.
[00:27:06.021 --> 00:27:08.162]  It is a misrepresentation.
[00:27:10.486 --> 00:27:12.787]  To again try to turn the military against the broadcast.
[00:27:13.187 --> 00:27:14.588]  But the military is actually listening.
[00:27:14.888 --> 00:27:17.549]  They know what I said versus how that was spun.
[00:27:17.729 --> 00:27:18.910]  But they keep retreading it.
[00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.890]  Let me stop there.
[00:27:21.831 --> 00:27:24.532]  On the Israel situation, the globalists are allied with Islam.
[00:27:25.273 --> 00:27:26.513]  They're trying to bring down the West.
[00:27:26.533 --> 00:27:27.654]  They're opening up our borders.
[00:27:27.874 --> 00:27:29.595]  They're using the Islamic threat to take our rights.
[00:27:29.915 --> 00:27:30.335]  And it's wrong.
[00:27:32.247 --> 00:27:36.493]  That does not mean that the Israel lobby doesn't get out of hand, and I have a problem with it.
[00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:39.917]  Just like the communist Chinese are the main influencer in our government, I don't like it.
[00:27:40.177 --> 00:27:41.219]  But I'm not an enemy of Israel.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:48.889]  And Trump understands that a choice has to be made, and he's got to move the embassy and not be a coward to Jerusalem, like he would any other country.
[00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:55.932]  And that he's got to stand up and be firm with the baby Palestinians who are suicide bombing their kids today all over the world.
[00:27:56.332 --> 00:27:58.412]  It's a whole bunch of suicide bombings all over the world.
[00:27:58.973 --> 00:28:00.233]  People blowing their little kids up.
[00:28:00.453 --> 00:28:01.013]  That's sick!
[00:28:01.273 --> 00:28:02.013]  That's satanic!
[00:28:02.053 --> 00:28:03.114]  That's child sacrifice!
[00:28:03.474 --> 00:28:04.194]  It's disgusting!
[00:28:06.054 --> 00:28:15.057]  But Trump understands that now he can come out with a really good peace deal that actually has concessions by the Israelis they've never done.
[00:28:15.697 --> 00:28:18.598]  With this olive branch to Israel,
[00:28:21.147 --> 00:28:24.732]  Now he can come back to the Palestinians and that's being announced, just like North Korea.
[00:28:25.393 --> 00:28:34.306]  Trump really wants to try to fix these problems, but I don't think the Palestinians ever want to fix it because their whole identity is their women wearing hoods over their heads.
[00:28:35.976 --> 00:28:41.578]  And cutting their little girls' genitals off, and screaming Allah Akbar, and putting plastic explosives around their children.
[00:28:42.398 --> 00:28:46.479]  And having six kids, and teaching, go north, go to Europe, conquer them, they are weak.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:53.262]  I've got the Imam of Jerusalem, the head guy saying, we will take over Europe, they're webbing their eyes, they are weak pig people.
[00:28:55.162 --> 00:28:55.562]  You know what?
[00:28:55.582 --> 00:29:00.044]  When somebody says they're coming to conquer me, I hear them, I believe them, and I'm raising the alarm.
[00:29:02.188 --> 00:29:06.571]  I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:07.091 --> 00:29:12.215]  And this is basically a product that I've been taking anyway before we even launched our own version of it.
[00:29:12.815 --> 00:29:15.497]  Now the product is bodies, whole body support.
[00:29:15.777 --> 00:29:21.060]  This is available right now at a massive 50% discount at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.763]  It's the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market.
[00:29:25.655 --> 00:29:33.418]  It's got the black pepper which makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and so much more.
[00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:40.641]  Now we're not even including a lot of the benefits that this product has been scientifically proven to have.
[00:29:40.881 --> 00:29:45.863]  People have been taking turmeric and noticed elevated moods, increased energy,
[00:29:46.443 --> 00:29:52.492]  And that's aside from all the other factors, all the other benefits that we're talking about in this promo.
[00:29:52.632 --> 00:29:53.453]  It's 50% off.
[00:29:53.493 --> 00:29:56.197]  And as I said, I was taking turmeric anyway.
[00:29:57.165 --> 00:29:58.146]  It's curcumin.
[00:29:58.366 --> 00:29:59.988]  It's the powder used in curry.
[00:30:00.008 --> 00:30:02.310]  You know, you wouldn't be able to take it naturally.
[00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:08.016]  It'd make you sneeze and cough, but we've got it in a 120 capsule bottle right here.
[00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:09.898]  Just got this fresh shipped in today.
[00:30:09.918 --> 00:30:11.840]  There's an article in Spectator Health.
[00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:19.328]  The article reads, daily consumption of curcumin improves the memory and mood of people with mild age-related memory loss, according to a new study.
[00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:22.782]  By the University of California in Los Angeles.
[00:30:23.362 --> 00:30:29.488]  Found in turmeric, curcumin has previously been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in lab studies.
[00:30:29.508 --> 00:30:35.695]  It's also been suggested as a possible reason that senior citizens in India, where curcumin is a dietary staple,
[00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:38.756]  Again, because it's in all the cooking, in all the curries.
[00:30:38.776 --> 00:30:43.078]  I have a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's and better cognitive performance.
[00:30:43.419 --> 00:30:44.419]  I take it anyway.
[00:30:44.579 --> 00:30:46.220]  So I just got this fresh today.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.381]  Literally, the seal's not even being opened on it.
[00:30:48.601 --> 00:30:48.881]  It's just $29.95.
[00:30:49.582 --> 00:30:52.343]  Again, big, big, chunky bottle.
[00:30:52.363 --> 00:30:53.884]  120 capsules in this bottle.
[00:30:54.504 --> 00:30:58.766]  It is BODYS, the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market.
[00:30:58.786 --> 00:31:01.608]  Available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:01.648 --> 00:31:02.168]  Get it today.
[00:31:06.892 --> 00:31:09.994]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:10.574]  You're on the air.
[00:31:10.594 --> 00:31:11.415]  Thanks for holding.
[00:31:11.515 --> 00:31:12.595]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:31:12.815 --> 00:31:13.396]  Hey, brother.
[00:31:13.736 --> 00:31:14.076]  Good, man.
[00:31:14.096 --> 00:31:14.916]  Thank you for calling.
[00:31:14.996 --> 00:31:15.557]  Hey, hey.
[00:31:15.637 --> 00:31:20.059]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:26.643]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Supermail, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Violent Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:31:26.783 --> 00:31:28.464]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[00:31:28.564 --> 00:31:34.727]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:31:35.868 --> 00:31:36.988]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:31:37.048 --> 00:31:41.049]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:43.030]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.230]  And exactly.
[00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:48.491]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:31:48.851 --> 00:31:49.111]  Boom!
[00:31:49.271 --> 00:31:52.092]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:31:52.152 --> 00:31:52.692]  It's amazing.
[00:31:52.732 --> 00:31:56.973]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:32:02.264 --> 00:32:04.907]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:32:05.327 --> 00:32:10.473]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:32:11.133 --> 00:32:14.076]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:32:14.497 --> 00:32:18.020]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:29.930]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:32:30.551 --> 00:32:41.299]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[00:32:41.599 --> 00:32:47.024]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.

[00:32:51.166 --> 00:32:52.586]  It's a 360 win.
[00:32:52.967 --> 00:32:58.249]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle, you're helping the fight for freedom.
[00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:59.890]  So please go to the site now.
[00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.990]  We need your support.
[00:33:06.913 --> 00:33:09.534]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:39.421 --> 00:33:45.803]  So Trump wants to break the stalemates with China, with North Korea, with the EU, with Israel and the Palestinians.
[00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:49.144]  Trump wants to negotiate better deals.
[00:33:49.404 --> 00:33:55.226]  There's an article up on DrugsReport.com that we'll be covering in the next segment saying big pivot by the president.
[00:33:56.397 --> 00:33:58.778]  Trump vows to protect jobs in China.
[00:33:59.979 --> 00:34:10.283]  Well, he comes in with these big, tough announcements and hundreds of billions in all these different fines that we know China has been breaking agreements on.
[00:34:11.084 --> 00:34:15.246]  And then he comes back and says, but if you negotiate with us, we won't make it as harsh.
[00:34:15.806 --> 00:34:16.866]  That's not flip-flopping.
[00:34:17.827 --> 00:34:18.887]  That's negotiating.
[00:34:20.108 --> 00:34:22.969]  And that's beginning to move the country in the right direction.
[00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:24.870]  But things have been so lopsided with China,
[00:34:26.018 --> 00:34:29.279]  That Trump needs to push this really, really, really, really far.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:46.926]  And to have the mainstream media up there complaining about $50 billion tariff on them when the trade deficit's $500 billion, not counting $300 billion in intellectual property stolen each year.
[00:34:47.607 --> 00:34:50.568]  And then now Trump slapped another $50 billion on them, so that's $100 billion.
[00:34:55.174 --> 00:35:02.192]  China has had it artificially set up on record, that's what globalism is, to de-industrialize this country.
[00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.931]  They're the anti-American team.
[00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:10.792]  They're bringing us to our knees through economics.
[00:35:10.812 --> 00:35:11.833]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[00:35:11.913 --> 00:35:13.673]  I want to play some of these historic clips, though.
[00:35:14.474 --> 00:35:15.714]  Jared Kushner, he speaks.
[00:35:16.395 --> 00:35:22.197]  He actually spoke from there at the dedication of the embassy that opens today.
[00:35:22.217 --> 00:35:24.118]  I'll show you some of those photos.
[00:35:24.598 --> 00:35:25.399]  Put them up on screen.
[00:35:25.419 --> 00:35:28.160]  They're on Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:35:29.275 --> 00:35:30.836]  There's a good one there with Ivanka Trump.
[00:35:31.736 --> 00:35:34.478]  Embassy, United States of America, Jerusalem, Israel.
[00:35:34.918 --> 00:35:36.158]  Donald J. Trump, President.
[00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:38.300]  Michael J. Pence, Vice President.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.802]  And it's so shocking that we would have an embassy in Jerusalem.
[00:35:44.223 --> 00:35:46.884]  That's how beat over the head we've been by the left.
[00:35:48.144 --> 00:35:50.886]  That's how manipulated we've been that that is a big deal.
[00:35:52.858 --> 00:36:03.243]  When I've got a stack of articles where they will not prosecute people in Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, for raping little girls.
[00:36:03.263 --> 00:36:06.445]  25, 30-year-old men brutally gang rape little children.
[00:36:07.326 --> 00:36:11.628]  And the leftist virtue signaling media and judges say it's okay.
[00:36:12.288 --> 00:36:13.689]  And they're allied with Islam.
[00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:17.371]  Again, one of my only blind spots.
[00:36:19.464 --> 00:36:24.249]  It was 15, 20 years ago, people thought I was pro-radical Islam because I was against all these wars.
[00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:36.800]  I was against going into Iraq, and I still am, because we were destabilizing the more moderate countries that were standing up to radical Islam.
[00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:38.862]  And now we know the plan.
[00:36:38.922 --> 00:36:39.782]  It's declassified.
[00:36:40.003 --> 00:36:42.285]  To totally break the borders of Russia.
[00:36:43.894 --> 00:36:56.881]  Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe and flood the giant demographic numbers in and create an untenable crisis out of which comes a total socialist state allied with the Muslims.
[00:36:57.702 --> 00:37:01.384]  And I know I keep harping on this, but that's the global takeover plan.
[00:37:03.547 --> 00:37:06.328]  That's the demographic, globalist, World War IV.
[00:37:07.008 --> 00:37:08.769]  They call the Cold War, World War III.
[00:37:09.049 --> 00:37:20.592]  But this whole technotronic, technocracy takeover, allied with Islam, savage, evil, corrupt, Stone Age, is here.
[00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:25.514]  And so that's what this is all about with Israel.
[00:37:27.293 --> 00:37:36.900]  I don't think Israel, just like the US and just like France, isn't playing a double game working with the Muslims and working to flood Europe and this whole exploitive plan.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:51.010]  But with Trump and other patriots and nationalists, we're trying to change this and have a real policy of prosperity and a good future and put pressure on radical Islam to reform itself and to stop.
[00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.451]  And as soon as the West told Saudi Arabia,
[00:37:54.397 --> 00:37:54.958]  You pull up.
[00:37:54.998 --> 00:37:56.599]  We're not going to back your Wahhabist ways.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.723]  They began immediate, seismic, real reforms.
[00:38:00.964 --> 00:38:03.867]  Because it's been the dog wagging the tail, folks.
[00:38:04.007 --> 00:38:05.048]  Saudi Arabia is the tail.
[00:38:05.769 --> 00:38:07.070]  The globalists have been using it.
[00:38:08.332 --> 00:38:12.656]  We could snap our fingers and overthrow Saudi Arabia in five minutes.
[00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:16.680]  And the whole global order
[00:38:17.526 --> 00:38:24.072]  To cuck the left and to militarize Islam and to flood everything and make a deal with the socialists in the future.
[00:38:24.312 --> 00:38:25.713]  That deal is horrible!
[00:38:26.234 --> 00:38:29.156]  That deal is crazy and abusive and psychotic.
[00:38:29.637 --> 00:38:30.477]  That's what the left does.
[00:38:32.379 --> 00:38:34.701]  Hitler tried to sign on with Islam to flood Europe.
[00:38:34.721 --> 00:38:35.402]  The same crap.
[00:38:35.962 --> 00:38:37.403]  And the Kalergi plan and all of it.
[00:38:38.905 --> 00:38:40.526]  We're not going along with it.
[00:38:40.887 --> 00:38:41.487]  And here's the deal.
[00:38:42.348 --> 00:38:43.529]  Unelected globalism.
[00:38:45.905 --> 00:38:53.330]  It's owned and run by the big tech giants and big banks that each big bank, each big tech giant, is bigger than most major countries' GDP.
[00:38:56.092 --> 00:38:59.614]  Last time I checked, Walmart had the 12th largest GDP in the world.
[00:39:00.895 --> 00:39:09.701]  Apple, last time I was looking at it, has more revenue than from the poorest 100 countries up.
[00:39:09.921 --> 00:39:14.044]  More than 100 countries put together doesn't have the GDP of Apple.
[00:39:17.312 --> 00:39:18.873]  I haven't looked at it in about a year.
[00:39:19.173 --> 00:39:23.514]  Let's look up companies that have GDPs bigger than major countries.
[00:39:24.415 --> 00:39:25.195]  It's stunning.
[00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:27.556]  Stunning.
[00:39:28.176 --> 00:39:40.321]  And these guys were setting up a world government where they're tax-exempt, where they have diplomatic immunity, where they don't pay taxes.
[00:39:45.063 --> 00:39:45.683]  It's incredible.
[00:39:46.787 --> 00:39:50.530]  And they are on power trips, and they've launched a breakaway civilization.
[00:39:51.891 --> 00:39:53.833]  With life extension and everything else.
[00:39:54.173 --> 00:39:56.395]  And they've made the decision.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.582]  They've made the decision that the future doesn't need us.
[00:40:05.022 --> 00:40:10.207]  And just like everything else I told you 20 years ago is now admitted, folks better pay attention to this broadcast.
[00:40:13.015 --> 00:40:18.277]  Because all the known, researched, thinking people know what I'm saying is true.
[00:40:19.097 --> 00:40:23.298]  They just don't believe in you and think you're going to do anything about it, so they're just keeping their mouths shut.
[00:40:23.318 --> 00:40:30.061]  So we're going to come back and play these historic clips.
[00:40:31.021 --> 00:40:33.922]  Trump pre-recorded message for Israel embassy opening in Jerusalem.
[00:40:34.322 --> 00:40:36.603]  Netanyahu speaks before a U.S.-Jerusalem assembly.
[00:40:37.243 --> 00:40:39.524]  Kushner speaks on strength of American-Israel relations.
[00:40:42.892 --> 00:40:54.400]  Now, the fact that I don't want to blow Israel off the map and let George Soros, the Islamist, have it, doesn't mean I support everything Israel does or some of the globalists, you know, Israel First groups and the ADL.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:41:01.724]  It's a pro-radical Islamic anti-American organization, but they're nothing now compared to Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:41:01.764 --> 00:41:07.848]  Goodness gracious, Southern Poverty Law Center is just a anti-American, anti-free speech disaster.
[00:41:08.529 --> 00:41:09.630]  But what I like seeing
[00:41:10.879 --> 00:41:14.923]  Is American Jews really get on board with Trump and Infowars?
[00:41:16.424 --> 00:41:17.165]  That's a good thing.
[00:41:17.285 --> 00:41:22.890]  People always accuse me of some weird mentally ill Jewish conspiracy I'm involved in when there's zero.
[00:41:24.051 --> 00:41:29.637]  To the contrary, Hollywood, leftist Jews and Soros, Nazi collaborators like him and others have attacked me.
[00:41:30.638 --> 00:41:32.279]  Nonsensically, continually.
[00:41:32.479 --> 00:41:33.881]  Because they're all part of this globalist program.
[00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.471]  But real Jewish Americans are hard-working patriots.
[00:41:38.491 --> 00:41:39.551]  They're just like everybody else.
[00:41:39.611 --> 00:41:40.512]  They love Infowars.
[00:41:40.552 --> 00:41:42.192]  They actually listen and they know what's going on.
[00:41:43.593 --> 00:41:48.694]  And so I saw photos and articles of people out there supporting Trump with Infowars shirts on and all the rest of it.
[00:41:48.734 --> 00:41:49.254]  I like that.
[00:41:49.815 --> 00:41:51.995]  I'm not ashamed of supporting good people in Israel.
[00:41:52.796 --> 00:41:57.357]  I'm not ashamed of supporting good Muslims who don't want to be part of this larger caliphate.
[00:42:00.714 --> 00:42:02.796]  So again, it just comes down to that.
[00:42:02.996 --> 00:42:07.201]  I'm not with Soros, I'm not with radical Islam, and you bet, I support Israel.
[00:42:07.621 --> 00:42:12.306]  But by being a supporter of Israel, then I can have more influence on things I don't like Israel's doing.
[00:42:14.529 --> 00:42:15.229]  See how that works?
[00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:20.415]  It's being realistic, and not just on one side, vitriolically, or the other.
[00:42:21.075 --> 00:42:23.098]  Alright, briefly, because I haven't even plugged yet today.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.922]  We've got a bunch of amazing products.
[00:42:25.962 --> 00:42:29.046]  Whatever the best supplement is, we go out, get it, make it even stronger.
[00:42:29.367 --> 00:42:36.176]  Whatever's got the best results, best reviews, strongest stuff out there for energy, stamina, inflammation, your body's 50% off.
[00:42:36.196 --> 00:42:36.636]  We've got X2.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.040]  How come Hollywood embraces
[00:43:08.476 --> 00:43:11.860]  This madman, this director, who raped a 13-year-old.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.802]  He didn't rape a 13-year-old.
[00:43:13.842 --> 00:43:14.963]  It was statutory rape.
[00:43:15.043 --> 00:43:15.824]  Yeah, alright.
[00:43:15.884 --> 00:43:18.426]  Well, it's not statutory rape.
[00:43:18.446 --> 00:43:20.308]  He had sex with a minor.
[00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:22.471]  That's not rape.
[00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:24.613]  He was guilty of having sex with a minor.
[00:43:24.933 --> 00:43:26.113]  That she didn't want to have.
[00:43:26.233 --> 00:43:27.714]  No, that was not the case at all.
[00:43:27.774 --> 00:43:28.834]  She wanted to have it.
[00:43:28.914 --> 00:43:32.095]  Well, in the transcripts... Dated the guy.
[00:43:32.435 --> 00:43:33.335]  Dated the guy.
[00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:34.795]  She was 13!
[00:43:35.156 --> 00:43:35.876]  And found out.
[00:43:35.936 --> 00:43:38.496]  Well, by the way, we're talking about America's morals.
[00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:40.817]  We're not talking about the morals in Europe and everything.
[00:43:41.437 --> 00:43:41.897]  Alright?
[00:43:41.997 --> 00:43:42.757]  Wait a second.
[00:43:42.777 --> 00:43:44.138]  Morals in Europe and morals in China?
[00:43:44.258 --> 00:43:51.840]  With a 13-year-old girl and you're in a grown man, you know that that's wrong because she has... You're giving her booze and pills.
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.060]  I'm not... Look.
[00:43:53.823 --> 00:43:54.964]  She was down with it.
[00:43:57.165 --> 00:43:58.385]  And she's talked about it.
[00:43:58.405 --> 00:43:59.346]  She's talked about it.
[00:43:59.706 --> 00:44:02.287]  Why would he defend Roman Polanski and pedophilia?
[00:44:02.868 --> 00:44:05.289]  And then why is he so arrogant?
[00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:07.270]  And why is he being protected by Hollywood?
[00:44:08.531 --> 00:44:10.712]  You know, that's a damn good question.
[00:44:10.732 --> 00:44:14.774]  The only thing I can come up with is because of power.
[00:44:15.894 --> 00:44:19.778]  You know, money and power within the industry.
[00:44:20.158 --> 00:44:30.208]  It's just the same thing that Weinstein was accused of, telling women they'd be blackballed, they'd never work again if they didn't submit to his commands.
[00:44:31.209 --> 00:44:36.694]  And basically, in my opinion, that's the same strength of the same position.
[00:44:40.656 --> 00:44:49.402]  When you look at Roman Polanski, what he's been able to get away with because, again, of his recognition of his position.
[00:44:49.783 --> 00:45:06.074]  These people, all of them, regardless of who they are, they become so full of themselves and self-importance and power within the industry that they basically feel they're above the law, they're above reproach, and they can get away with any damn thing they feel like.
[00:45:06.714 --> 00:45:16.202]  And when you listen to some of the idiotic things that he has said, not just now, but all through his career, ever since he became well-known.
[00:45:17.243 --> 00:45:19.165]  And to me, that's really too bad.
[00:45:19.205 --> 00:45:23.709]  Hey, I'm an actor, but I'm no different than anybody else.
[00:45:23.749 --> 00:45:25.150]  That's what I do for a living.
[00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:30.635]  That doesn't make me, you know, above anybody else in any other way.
[00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:34.138]  It's just what you do for a living.
[00:45:35.322 --> 00:45:36.824]  You have a job.
[00:45:37.324 --> 00:45:40.087]  You have what you do for a living and you're good at it.
[00:45:40.387 --> 00:45:48.515]  But that doesn't set you up against the rest of the world and make you any better of a person than anybody else.
[00:45:48.535 --> 00:45:53.039]  And people that take that attitude and think they are, they're sick.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.522]  They have a real problem.
[00:45:55.602 --> 00:45:57.223]  They need to come back down to earth.
[00:45:57.303 --> 00:45:58.725]  Somebody needs to put them there.
[00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:11.801]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:46:11.882 --> 00:46:19.991]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:46:20.271 --> 00:46:24.973]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:46:25.154 --> 00:46:31.857]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:31.937 --> 00:46:39.020]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:45.964]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:46:46.144 --> 00:46:50.487]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:53.890]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:46:54.010 --> 00:47:00.135]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:47:00.315 --> 00:47:02.016]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:06.399 --> 00:47:09.021]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:30.169 --> 00:47:36.952]  Israeli snipers kill scores of Palestinians and wound 2,400 as 35,000 protesters rally against the U.S.
[00:47:36.992 --> 00:47:43.315]  Embassy opening in Jerusalem, overseen by Trump's Middle East envoy Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka.
[00:47:43.675 --> 00:47:49.438]  And you know, I'm glad the Daily Mail's covering that, and I'm glad that we're covering it, and I'm glad that Drudge Report has it.
[00:47:50.518 --> 00:47:51.119]  We're covering it.
[00:47:51.739 --> 00:47:57.822]  Just because I support Israel doesn't mean I support the image of drones firing tear gas at demonstrators.
[00:47:59.011 --> 00:48:00.392]  Or snipers shooting people.
[00:48:01.473 --> 00:48:09.400]  But, you see, the media hardly covers it with the hourly suicide bombings, or people getting stabbed to death or run over by trucks.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.221]  They won't even ever say it's Islamic!
[00:48:14.063 --> 00:48:21.670]  So, see, it just should say snipers kill scores of people and wound 2,400.
[00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:27.715]  Because if it was Islamists doing it, they would not say Muslims or Islamists.
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.901]  They would just say, snipers kill.
[00:48:33.263 --> 00:48:39.967]  And if the police reported that it was Islamists doing it, they'd get fired.
[00:48:41.208 --> 00:48:42.509]  Oh, and what are the folks doing?
[00:48:42.529 --> 00:48:46.191]  They're trying to knock down the fences and climb over for an intifada.
[00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:51.514]  And you've got your nice mix of, you know, suicide bombings going on.
[00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:53.716]  So it's tribal warfare.
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.623]  You know what happens if the Palestinians try to go over the fence into Egypt?
[00:48:58.723 --> 00:48:59.203]  They get shot.
[00:48:59.223 --> 00:49:01.945]  You know what happens if they try to go over the fence into Jordan?
[00:49:01.985 --> 00:49:02.466]  They get shot.
[00:49:02.486 --> 00:49:05.348]  You know what happens if they try to go over the fence into Saudi Arabia?
[00:49:05.368 --> 00:49:06.108]  They get shot.
[00:49:09.551 --> 00:49:11.292]  But see, you never see that on the news.
[00:49:12.493 --> 00:49:14.295]  It's just a little footnote in the foreign news.
[00:49:14.595 --> 00:49:17.197]  You only hear about it if Israel
[00:49:20.626 --> 00:49:20.766]  Yes.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:44.683]  And then, when there'll probably be 20 or 30 bombings in Nigeria this week by Muslims, all one-sided killing Christians, nothing in our niche.
[00:49:45.083 --> 00:50:01.669]  There'll be bombings all over the Middle East, all over Central Asia, shootings, killings, little girls having their throats slit, lined up and shot, gays being thrown off buildings, priests being murdered, and not one word out of that demon Pope, who says, open the borders of Europe!
[00:50:04.275 --> 00:50:06.637]  There's almost no coverage of little girls getting raped.
[00:50:06.677 --> 00:50:12.982]  And if jihadists in Germany see you walking with your dog, they'll physically attack you, screaming, unclean, unclean.
[00:50:13.683 --> 00:50:15.944]  That's constantly in the back of the newspaper.
[00:50:17.666 --> 00:50:18.807]  Do you see what I'm getting at now?
[00:50:19.227 --> 00:50:20.268]  How my brain works?
[00:50:21.909 --> 00:50:22.670]  How my brain works.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:39.498]  Is that I warn you about drones being prepared a decade ago for tear gas against crowds with a company that got a homeland security contract and the media comes out and says Jones made it up because they didn't want to have a debate about it.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.283]  And now it's happening in Israel!
[00:50:45.618 --> 00:50:51.243]  But the reason I support Trump and the reason I'm supporting Israel is Trump has a plan to try to end this crud.
[00:50:51.583 --> 00:51:10.198]  And if the Palestinians, it's going to get announced in the next few months, we know how Trump operates, it's already been announced, it'll be announced soon, a real deal for massive economic development in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip, in all those areas, concessions on land, you name it.
[00:51:11.079 --> 00:51:13.221]  But Trump's got to butter Israel up first.
[00:51:14.502 --> 00:51:15.862]  So I want to see peace there.
[00:51:16.983 --> 00:51:22.164]  I know there's a lot of bad conditions for the Palestinians, but I equally blame the Arabs just as much.
[00:51:24.005 --> 00:51:26.725]  And I'm sick of them getting a pass.
[00:51:27.146 --> 00:51:27.706]  I'm done.
[00:51:27.726 --> 00:51:30.727]  I will not sit here and be a hypocrite.
[00:51:30.827 --> 00:51:33.047]  I will point out hypocrisy when I see it.
[00:51:33.067 --> 00:51:38.589]  I'm going to play some of these clips in a moment, but first, we tweeted this last week, and I meant to cover it.
[00:51:39.642 --> 00:51:42.303]  And I saw it in my stack, so I'm going to cover it again right now.
[00:51:42.343 --> 00:51:45.504]  I just retweeted this at Real Alex Jones about 10 minutes ago.
[00:51:46.564 --> 00:51:47.485]  Asked Paul to retweet it.
[00:51:47.545 --> 00:51:50.446]  I really want to have this go viral because this illustrates everything.
[00:51:51.746 --> 00:51:55.727]  We even predicted last year when we saw this that this was going to end up happening.
[00:51:56.888 --> 00:52:02.229]  We tweeted, Los Angeles Times, October 6, 2017.
[00:52:06.778 --> 00:52:14.461]  Knowingly exposing others to HIV will no longer be a felony in California, it'll be a Class C misdemeanor or a ticket, $100 ticket.
[00:52:17.042 --> 00:52:19.223]  That means hepatitis, you name it, just go ahead and kill somebody.
[00:52:20.123 --> 00:52:27.386]  You can even give blood and then a lot of that gets through, then kill a bunch of hemophiliacs or somebody has a car wreck and uses a blood transfusion and you die a horrible HIV death.
[00:52:27.687 --> 00:52:28.267]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:52:29.427 --> 00:52:30.928]  Because we don't want a stigma!
[00:52:32.409 --> 00:52:33.690]  All the virtue signaling.
[00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:39.453]  And I predicted that we would see STDs go up and they would spin it and say it was racism or something.
[00:52:39.513 --> 00:52:43.955]  And sure enough, last week, look at this headline, STDs in L.A.
[00:52:44.015 --> 00:52:45.576]  County are skyrocketing.
[00:52:45.616 --> 00:52:48.618]  Officials think racism and stigma may be to blame.
[00:52:49.118 --> 00:52:49.538]  Wow!
[00:52:51.379 --> 00:52:53.440]  People shooting up, having sex on the streets.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.302]  California, Southern California and the L.A.
[00:52:56.362 --> 00:52:58.503]  area is like a dystopic nightmare.
[00:52:59.773 --> 00:53:02.194]  The smog, the homeless people, the needles.
[00:53:02.555 --> 00:53:04.376]  And if you're a radio listener, this isn't as powerful.
[00:53:04.736 --> 00:53:07.197]  It's the same LA Times format.
[00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:08.838]  It's their same tweets.
[00:53:09.799 --> 00:53:10.939]  Side by side.
[00:53:10.959 --> 00:53:13.481]  This is not even edited.
[00:53:13.821 --> 00:53:14.761]  This is their tweets.
[00:53:17.703 --> 00:53:18.363]  Their headlines.
[00:53:19.304 --> 00:53:26.808]  Knowingly exposing others to HIV will no longer be a felony in California to get rid of the stigma and fight sexism and racism, the article went on to say.
[00:53:27.893 --> 00:53:31.014]  Then, less than a year later, STDs in L.A.
[00:53:31.074 --> 00:53:32.114]  County are skyrocketing.
[00:53:32.154 --> 00:53:34.494]  Officials think racism and stigma may be to blame.
[00:53:34.854 --> 00:53:38.775]  No, you're to blame for this atmosphere, you crazy people.
[00:53:39.035 --> 00:53:39.975]  And here are the actual articles.
[00:53:41.356 --> 00:53:43.516]  Knowingly exposing others' HIV will no longer be a felony.
[00:53:43.896 --> 00:53:45.817]  And the governor said how great it was.
[00:53:45.857 --> 00:53:51.978]  And they actually had the advocate websites and all those go, look, Jones is being homophobic.
[00:53:54.113 --> 00:53:55.495]  You're the one being homophobic.
[00:53:55.515 --> 00:53:59.199]  What are you doing attaching HIV to gay people only?
[00:53:59.239 --> 00:54:00.420]  What about intravenous drug users?
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.441]  What about heterosexuals?
[00:54:01.702 --> 00:54:02.723]  What about all this stuff?
[00:54:03.604 --> 00:54:04.965]  But again, this is crazy!
[00:54:05.886 --> 00:54:08.169]  And then the STD levels go up.
[00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:09.911]  STDs in L.A.
[00:54:09.951 --> 00:54:10.672]  County are skyrocketing.
[00:54:10.692 --> 00:54:11.773]  There's the actual L.A.
[00:54:11.793 --> 00:54:12.334]  Times articles.
[00:54:14.735 --> 00:54:20.360]  All right, getting back to the news in Israel, let's go ahead and go to this Jared Kushner.
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:27.806]  He speaks on the strength of American-Israel relations, a very rare moment when Jared Kushner opens his mouth.
[00:54:27.867 --> 00:54:28.287]  Here it is.
[00:54:29.388 --> 00:54:40.618]  In December of last year, President Trump announced to the world that the United States would finally recognize the truth, that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.
[00:54:45.191 --> 00:54:50.055]  He also declared that we would soon move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
[00:54:50.595 --> 00:54:53.878]  And just five months later, we are standing on these grounds.
[00:54:59.022 --> 00:55:06.988]  While presidents before him have backed down from their pledge to move the American embassy once in office, this president delivered.
[00:55:07.688 --> 00:55:10.951]  Because when President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it.
[00:55:16.184 --> 00:55:18.605]  But today also demonstrates American leadership.
[00:55:19.406 --> 00:55:25.588]  By moving our embassy to Jerusalem, we have shown the world once again that the United States can be trusted.
[00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:35.733]  We stand with our friends and our allies, and above all else, we've shown that the United States of America will do what's right, and so we have.
[00:55:39.455 --> 00:55:41.576]  It looks pretty, uh...
[00:55:42.352 --> 00:55:42.672]  Strong.
[00:55:42.973 --> 00:55:49.878]  Israel's a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital, the same right that is enjoyed by every other country in the world.
[00:55:50.738 --> 00:55:56.383]  In taking this action, the United States has also chosen to strengthen the bond between our two countries.
[00:55:57.384 --> 00:55:59.946]  Our special bond is the envy of nations throughout the world.
[00:56:00.686 --> 00:56:07.830]  This bond is forged through shared history, sustained through shared interests, and immortalized through shared principles.
[00:56:08.851 --> 00:56:12.813]  The United States stands with Israel because we both believe in freedom.
[00:56:13.734 --> 00:56:17.076]  We stand together because we both believe in human rights.
[00:56:17.776 --> 00:56:22.159]  We stand together because we believe democracy is worth defending.
[00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:29.523]  And the United States stands with Israel because we believe, we know, that it is the right thing to do.
[00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.890]  Let's break this down.
[00:56:34.151 --> 00:56:35.772]  And of course Kushner just said it right there.
[00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:37.654]  It's straight up, straight shooting.
[00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:38.735]  As a Texan, I like that.
[00:56:39.856 --> 00:56:43.519]  And with Trump, what he says is what you get.
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.482]  Like he came on the show and said, I will not let you down.
[00:56:48.784 --> 00:56:49.405]  Give me a year.
[00:56:49.905 --> 00:56:51.127]  We'll start turning the country around.
[00:56:51.147 --> 00:56:54.230]  I mean, it's just dead on.
[00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:55.170]  It's with Trump.
[00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:59.792]  You actually... He straight shoots you.
[00:56:59.832 --> 00:57:00.752]  It makes me stutter.
[00:57:00.792 --> 00:57:01.493]  It's so unbelievable.
[00:57:02.433 --> 00:57:09.717]  And even if you don't agree with some of his policies, maybe you don't agree with this Israel thing, moving the embassy there from Tel Aviv?
[00:57:11.358 --> 00:57:11.658]  Really?
[00:57:11.818 --> 00:57:12.578]  That's that big a deal?
[00:57:12.678 --> 00:57:13.699]  Riot and go crazy?
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.721]  And now Trump is prepping the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.
[00:57:19.182 --> 00:57:24.805]  But I don't think the Palestinians are going to want to take the money and the power plants and the swimming pools and the factories.
[00:57:25.385 --> 00:57:30.748]  North Korea though, once at Pompeo, says post-nuclear Korean economy will rival South Korea.
[00:57:31.758 --> 00:57:34.059]  That's the real economic deal, and the U.S.
[00:57:34.099 --> 00:57:36.079]  is cutting North Korea out from China.
[00:57:36.499 --> 00:57:38.900]  The Chinese and the Koreans have always hated each other, by the way.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.221]  China's been invading it scores of times the last thousand years.
[00:57:42.721 --> 00:57:45.382]  And so, they're being offered the full Marshall Plan, maybe.
[00:57:45.402 --> 00:57:47.263]  People say, well, they're a dictator.
[00:57:47.603 --> 00:57:48.983]  That'll phase all that out.
[00:57:49.423 --> 00:57:50.784]  It'll make their lives a lot better.
[00:57:50.824 --> 00:57:51.404]  I'm all for it.
[00:57:53.081 --> 00:57:54.781]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:57:55.362 --> 00:57:56.702]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:57:56.942 --> 00:58:00.463]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.

[00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:13.586]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:58:13.746 --> 00:58:19.208]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.

[00:58:27.332 --> 00:58:31.774]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:58:32.054 --> 00:58:37.817]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[00:58:37.937 --> 00:58:40.898]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[00:58:52.484 --> 00:58:53.325]  Pike in Arizona.
[00:58:53.345 --> 00:58:54.345]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:58:54.385 --> 00:58:54.766]  Go ahead.
[00:58:55.626 --> 00:58:57.527]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:58:57.567 --> 00:59:07.913]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:59:08.073 --> 00:59:11.415]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:59:11.875 --> 00:59:12.215]  Absolutely.
[00:59:34.352 --> 00:59:47.620]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:59:54.564 --> 01:00:00.448]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.622 --> 01:00:23.544]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:24.604 --> 01:00:29.326]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.006 --> 01:00:48.493]  Omar Navarro is running against the anti-American, frothing, gangster, kingpin, Cujo, also known as the... globalist, motor-mouth, Maxine Waters.
[01:00:49.909 --> 01:00:53.791]  He's going to be popping in, bottom of the next hour, to talk about all of her annex.
[01:00:53.891 --> 01:00:58.214]  And we've got Milo here in studio, working on a bunch of stuff.
[01:00:58.234 --> 01:01:04.257]  We're thinking about going out and working on a special report today after the broadcast as well, so stay tuned for that.
[01:01:05.318 --> 01:01:06.919]  Not going to announce what it is yet, obviously.
[01:01:08.199 --> 01:01:11.041]  But we're going to be busy little beavers.
[01:01:11.941 --> 01:01:16.424]  So Milo Yiannopoulos is going to be in studio with us, coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:01:18.837 --> 01:01:27.105]  I've told myself I'm going to be calm, at least for the foreseeable future, because I let myself look at all this news and get wound up.
[01:01:27.866 --> 01:01:31.689]  But I thought, why not just have some of the nice, calm Alex?
[01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:38.135]  And you know, in the last hour, I think on a scale of 1 to 10, my most obnoxious, I was about a 3.
[01:01:39.537 --> 01:01:41.799]  So we're going to see if I can be a good boy today.
[01:01:43.097 --> 01:01:44.718]  Because there is no producer in charge of me.
[01:01:44.758 --> 01:01:45.498]  Maybe there should be.
[01:01:46.619 --> 01:02:01.308]  But I just... These subjects are so heady, so powerful, so big, so serious that the times are so important that I've raised the alarm with the hysterics.
[01:02:01.688 --> 01:02:03.669]  And we should be hysterical about a lot of the things happening.
[01:02:04.209 --> 01:02:05.290]  To get people out of their trance.
[01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.392]  But there's also a time, I think, to be smooth.
[01:02:09.502 --> 01:02:12.924]  And I think I'm going to try to be a little smoother, at least here and there.
[01:02:13.545 --> 01:02:14.165]  But we'll see.
[01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:19.128]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:25.352]  But here's Netanyahu on the historic opening of the U.S.
[01:02:25.432 --> 01:02:31.056]  Embassy and Trump's announcement that he wants a big peace deal and economic development for the Palestinians.
[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:42.778]  But of course, there's nothing like being victims in drama cleaning, so I don't expect they're going to accept the deal, but don't say Trump isn't going to try to give them their fattest deal ever.
[01:02:43.579 --> 01:02:46.021]  That of course will be summarily torn up and urinated all over.
[01:02:46.902 --> 01:02:48.123]  But hey, that's what it is.
[01:02:48.923 --> 01:02:51.826]  I'm just not into the whole cause celeb thing for Palestine.
[01:02:52.546 --> 01:02:56.930]  I've been bullied and brainwashed my whole life about it, and I reject it.
[01:02:58.353 --> 01:03:00.435]  But I'm also not a cult follower of Israel either.
[01:03:01.316 --> 01:03:03.417]  I just don't want to blow them off the map like George Soros does.
[01:03:03.457 --> 01:03:07.341]  There's a lot of good people over there.
[01:03:10.183 --> 01:03:13.907]  And they've got hundreds of nuclear weapons, so they're not going anywhere.
[01:03:13.927 --> 01:03:16.209]  What about the Samson-Obson?
[01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:18.391]  Bring the whole house down?
[01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:21.571]  Keep dreaming Soros.
[01:03:21.871 --> 01:03:23.352]  Keep dreaming Devil Pope.
[01:03:23.992 --> 01:03:25.833]  You're not bringing Israel down, scum.
[01:03:26.433 --> 01:03:28.815]  See, that'll make you really align.
[01:03:30.175 --> 01:03:33.537]  Because the very same dirtbags are trying to destroy me.
[01:03:33.557 --> 01:03:34.498]  They're trying to destroy Israel.
[01:03:35.058 --> 01:03:36.619]  And that really makes you pull back.
[01:03:36.659 --> 01:03:39.360]  You know, I have the exact same enemies.
[01:03:40.962 --> 01:03:43.784]  Why have I been bullied into not being more pro-Israel?
[01:03:44.344 --> 01:03:46.566]  Because my enemies know I'm not anti-Israel.
[01:03:46.606 --> 01:03:48.687]  They know I support Israel.
[01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:51.629]  It's just I don't worship it like a Christian Zionist.
[01:03:52.189 --> 01:03:55.512]  I've got a lot of family and people that are big, big, big...
[01:03:58.021 --> 01:04:01.044]  I guess you'd call it Baptist, or almost Evangelical.
[01:04:01.084 --> 01:04:03.767]  I mean, I went to both Baptist and Evangelical churches growing up as a kid.
[01:04:03.787 --> 01:04:07.471]  But yeah, there are more pro-Israel people that live in Israel, some of those folks.
[01:04:07.551 --> 01:04:15.519]  And it gets a little crazy, and the world's ending every year, and oh my God, it's the end of the world, and they've got to run to Israel to pray, and everything's going to get blown up.
[01:04:15.999 --> 01:04:20.463]  You know, there's that extreme over there, not really close family or anything, but
[01:04:22.469 --> 01:04:26.450]  Mom or dad, I guess a lot of close family, you could call them, Christian Zionists.
[01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:29.271]  So, I grew up with that giving me a headache.
[01:04:31.412 --> 01:04:37.214]  And then all the leftist Jews running around calling everybody the anti-Semite of their pro-America, that gets really old.
[01:04:37.895 --> 01:04:41.356]  And then you've got all the Muslim groups trying to bully you into being anti-Israel, and that gets old.
[01:04:41.396 --> 01:04:44.137]  And George Soros trying to bully you into it, and I'm just sick of it!
[01:04:46.564 --> 01:04:49.969]  If I keep saying I work for Israel, I'm gonna do a trip in the next year.
[01:04:50.009 --> 01:04:51.592]  I'm going to Israel and I'm going to Russia.
[01:04:51.752 --> 01:04:55.357]  Because I'm not against either one of them, and I also don't work for them.
[01:04:55.738 --> 01:04:56.619]  I'm an American!
[01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.604]  My family helped found this thing.
[01:04:59.864 --> 01:05:00.886]  That's who I serve.
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:07.321]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[01:05:07.661 --> 01:05:15.123]  Between debt crisis, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply of storable meals is crucial.

[01:06:13.352 --> 01:06:19.396]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.266 --> 01:06:44.891]  You know, I don't normally get into the Stormy Daniels thing because she never alleged abuse and you can tell that Melania is a pretty wild number herself.
[01:06:45.351 --> 01:06:47.492]  If she was a car, she'd have like 5,000 horsepower.
[01:06:48.592 --> 01:06:51.733]  If anything, the Stormy Daniels was a 10 steps down.
[01:06:51.813 --> 01:06:53.754]  I mean, my God, what a woman, Melania.
[01:06:55.584 --> 01:06:57.105]  That's all you need right there, right?
[01:06:58.025 --> 01:06:58.545]  But whatever.
[01:06:58.606 --> 01:07:00.807]  We didn't elect Trump to be a choir boy.
[01:07:00.847 --> 01:07:02.107]  We elect him to get stuff done.
[01:07:02.547 --> 01:07:03.388]  He's not a hypocrite.
[01:07:03.848 --> 01:07:10.231]  If he got up there and talked about family values all day long and swore he'd never cheated on his wife or never had a girlfriend, I'd be really angry.
[01:07:10.811 --> 01:07:11.312]  But guess what?
[01:07:11.332 --> 01:07:12.152]  He didn't ever do that.
[01:07:15.694 --> 01:07:20.717]  Just like he keeps fulfilling his promises, just like he keeps delivering on what he says he'll do.
[01:07:21.117 --> 01:07:22.417]  Doesn't mean I agree with all of it.
[01:07:22.558 --> 01:07:23.598]  I disagree with about 10%.
[01:07:24.018 --> 01:07:29.621]  But I really agree with, you know, what you told me, you're going to do or really try.
[01:07:30.722 --> 01:07:31.922]  Man, that's so valuable.
[01:07:32.042 --> 01:07:34.264]  I grew up in Texas when Texas was still Texas.
[01:07:36.204 --> 01:07:38.426]  And where men were men and women were women.
[01:07:39.366 --> 01:07:44.569]  And if you ever lied to somebody after you were a teenager, a teenager is all kind of fib and stuff.
[01:07:46.185 --> 01:07:48.087]  Just no one would ever even be around you.
[01:07:48.287 --> 01:07:54.111]  I mean, the value is in people knowing that guy's a rock.
[01:07:56.793 --> 01:07:57.893]  I want to be known as a rock.
[01:07:59.935 --> 01:08:04.098]  I want people to know, hey, Jones says something, he's gonna really do it.
[01:08:05.339 --> 01:08:06.199]  That's my currency.
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:08.321]  Like Tony Montana says.
[01:08:10.196 --> 01:08:12.777]  There's only two things you got in this world, and I won't break them for anybody.
[01:08:12.877 --> 01:08:14.077]  My word or my huevos.
[01:08:14.738 --> 01:08:15.438]  And that's the truth.
[01:08:16.318 --> 01:08:17.919]  And that is really all you got at the end of the day.
[01:08:19.039 --> 01:08:20.539]  And that's why Trump is so refreshing.
[01:08:20.559 --> 01:08:21.300]  In fact, I hardly ever do this.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.460]  I'm gonna play Kushner twice.
[01:08:24.061 --> 01:08:25.521]  Wow, why hasn't Kushner been speaking?
[01:08:25.561 --> 01:08:27.242]  He looks pretty authoritative, looks strong.
[01:08:27.982 --> 01:08:29.022]  Got a nice gleam in the eye.
[01:08:30.743 --> 01:08:33.164]  Sounds nervous, but hey, man, get over it, bro!
[01:08:34.784 --> 01:08:35.825]  You come off strong!
[01:08:37.545 --> 01:08:39.906]  And again, take Israel out of the equation here.
[01:08:43.035 --> 01:08:44.557]  Trump said he'd do this, he did it!
[01:08:44.617 --> 01:08:52.785]  That's why North Korea knows, you give up your nukes, we're gonna put in power stations all over your country, and the South's ready to totally develop you.
[01:08:56.449 --> 01:09:01.794]  Within 15 years after the Korean War, it was already one of the richest countries in the world, the entire South was basically leveled.
[01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:03.156]  Millions dead.
[01:09:04.864 --> 01:09:07.646]  It's the most productive country in the world.
[01:09:08.307 --> 01:09:09.868]  The North is the most unproductive.
[01:09:10.488 --> 01:09:14.892]  That's communism versus capitalism, again, screaming out at everybody.
[01:09:20.576 --> 01:09:29.723]  I saw some idiot article saying, Alex Jones says, Iceland doesn't exist.
[01:09:32.205 --> 01:09:36.447]  And I read it, and it's like, Jones claims there's no successful socialist or communist countries.
[01:09:36.868 --> 01:09:38.088]  But Iceland's successful.
[01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:47.634]  Actually, contrary, the only socialist countries that are successful are northern European, homogenous,
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:58.925]  Ice age populations, which are very high rates of OCD, very high rates of... The trains are all on time, everybody is extremely neurotic.
[01:09:59.265 --> 01:10:06.129]  Genetically, because if you went outside five minutes too long, in the genetic background of those people, you were dead.
[01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:16.434]  They're always finding, you know, people buried in the ice up there, in their little furs, in the little group of fish they had on their side or whatever, flash frozen.
[01:10:17.469 --> 01:10:18.777]  You know, back from the Ice Age?
[01:10:19.803 --> 01:10:20.326]  Just 10,000 years ago?
[01:10:22.694 --> 01:10:23.815]  Covered nice year-round?
[01:10:24.475 --> 01:10:26.376]  Sometimes of the year, two hours of sunlight?
[01:10:26.496 --> 01:10:27.757]  You can only go out during that?
[01:10:27.917 --> 01:10:36.081]  You don't... Yes, yes, northern Europeans, yes, Viking populations were known for being ravenous and murderous and all this other stuff.
[01:10:36.341 --> 01:10:38.962]  That's really just one small avenue of the background of it.
[01:10:39.202 --> 01:10:42.004]  They actually opened up with Russia today with their flat boats.
[01:10:42.144 --> 01:10:44.345]  They've dug them up in China, northern China.
[01:10:44.545 --> 01:10:48.227]  They've dug up hundreds of Vikings, their whole settlements, you name it, trading.
[01:10:48.867 --> 01:10:50.628]  It was an ancient trading empire.
[01:10:51.168 --> 01:10:52.089]  But they actually
[01:10:54.534 --> 01:10:55.415]  We're very communal.
[01:10:55.935 --> 01:10:59.117]  Well, you can be communal in small groups of a few hundred people.
[01:11:00.138 --> 01:11:03.980]  You can have little towns and little villages in Iceland with 400,000 people.
[01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:07.863]  No one ever said you can't have communes on a farm.
[01:11:09.204 --> 01:11:13.047]  You don't have them, though, with big cities and, you know, a hundred million people.
[01:11:13.287 --> 01:11:16.849]  That creates hell on earth and the ultimate class system.
[01:11:16.869 --> 01:11:17.690]  But I'm already digressing.
[01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.251]  I don't even get off onto that.
[01:11:22.898 --> 01:11:24.879]  The point is, I was talking about North Korea.
[01:11:25.519 --> 01:11:27.240]  Trump is making a deal with North Korea.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.280]  He's about to make a deal with the Palestinians if they'll take it.
[01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:35.182]  Pompeo says nuclear North Korea economy, the post-nuclear economy, will rival the South.
[01:11:37.583 --> 01:11:42.505]  And he said you're going to have electricity, and you're going to have jobs, and you're going to be able to go on vacations, and you're going to be able to eat meat.
[01:11:43.936 --> 01:11:48.380]  And I saw some trendy publication go, oh, as if eating meat is the symbol of success.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.783]  It sure as hell is in North Korea, where most people have never had any meat.
[01:11:56.767 --> 01:11:57.867]  That's the ultra-rich.
[01:11:57.928 --> 01:11:59.469]  That's Korea-speak right there.
[01:12:02.571 --> 01:12:05.254]  We're about to turn your lights on, baby!
[01:12:06.161 --> 01:12:09.503]  We're about to bring you into the 21st century!
[01:12:09.763 --> 01:12:10.463]  You're smart!
[01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:11.644]  You're hardworking!
[01:12:11.844 --> 01:12:26.112]  You're about to get emancipated from communism and the UN 60-something years ago that made the decision to let the communist Chinese run the North because the CIA had just put Mao Zedong into power three years before treasonously!
[01:12:26.672 --> 01:12:29.314]  And all that New World Order is getting overturned!
[01:12:29.894 --> 01:12:34.757]  All those stinking plans to keep huge groups of people in hell!
[01:12:37.034 --> 01:12:38.235]  Is being reversed.
[01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:39.775]  Trump is trying to reverse it.
[01:12:39.835 --> 01:12:42.297]  He said, I want victory for the planet.
[01:12:44.538 --> 01:12:47.519]  You know how much that upsets the globalists that have set this whole thing up?
[01:12:47.959 --> 01:12:49.980]  It makes them pull their hair out.
[01:12:50.321 --> 01:12:50.721]  So here...
[01:12:52.406 --> 01:12:55.247]  It's Kushner, then I'll play Bibi, and then I'll play Trump.
[01:12:55.287 --> 01:12:58.008]  But this Kushner statement is powerful.
[01:12:58.488 --> 01:13:00.549]  This is the whole gist of everything Trump's doing.
[01:13:00.869 --> 01:13:04.810]  If he doesn't deliver on what he says he does, other people won't listen, like Gaddafi.
[01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:11.933]  Obama said, give us all your money, invest with us, open it up to the West, let your country be taken over by the West for industrialization, and we won't kill you.
[01:13:12.193 --> 01:13:14.754]  And he went to Europe and met with everybody, he's like, great, I want to be your friend.
[01:13:14.954 --> 01:13:16.354]  They set him up and killed him.
[01:13:16.754 --> 01:13:18.875]  You don't think the world didn't watch that treachery?
[01:13:20.862 --> 01:13:27.546]  So they can bring in a bunch of radical jihadis and murder tens of thousands of innocent people and kill every black they see on sight because the Arabs are so racist?
[01:13:29.847 --> 01:13:30.808]  Here's Kushner.
[01:13:31.948 --> 01:13:39.753]  In December of last year, President Trump announced to the world that the United States would finally recognize the truth.
[01:13:40.453 --> 01:13:42.875]  That Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.
[01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:56.437]  He also declared that we would soon move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and just five months later, we are standing on these grounds.
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:09.545]  While presidents before him have backed down from their pledge to move the American embassy once in office, this president delivered.
[01:14:10.246 --> 01:14:13.428]  Because when President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.181]  But today also demonstrates American leadership.
[01:14:21.982 --> 01:14:28.166]  By moving our embassy to Jerusalem, we have shown the world once again that the United States can be trusted.
[01:14:28.906 --> 01:14:38.291]  We stand with our friends and our allies, and above all else, we've shown that the United States of America will do what's right, and so we have.
[01:14:38.312 --> 01:14:41.854]  That's right.
[01:14:42.414 --> 01:14:43.394]  I mean, big deal.
[01:14:43.414 --> 01:14:44.055]  Move an embassy.
[01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:52.448]  Israel's a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital, the same right that is enjoyed by every other country in the world.
[01:14:53.309 --> 01:14:58.893]  In taking this action, the United States has also chosen to strengthen the bond between our two countries.
[01:14:58.913 --> 01:14:59.413]  Oh, that's good.
[01:14:59.433 --> 01:15:03.716]  Now understand, every time I try to give the Palatinians stuff, they blow up even more.
[01:15:03.756 --> 01:15:04.616]  They don't want to have a deal.
[01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:05.857]  They want Israel gone.
[01:15:06.317 --> 01:15:08.198]  So we're like, hey, you want Israel gone?
[01:15:08.238 --> 01:15:08.999]  That's not happening.
[01:15:09.279 --> 01:15:09.759]  Game over.
[01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.881]  You want to have a real discussion and act like adults?
[01:15:11.901 --> 01:15:12.321]  Let's do it.
[01:15:12.701 --> 01:15:13.482]  But you don't want that.
[01:15:13.962 --> 01:15:24.946]  Because everywhere in the Middle East is a squalid hellhole of people crapping on the side of the road and wiping their rear ends with their hands and just absolutely living in hell.
[01:15:26.466 --> 01:15:28.147]  And Islam has had golden periods.
[01:15:28.187 --> 01:15:29.387]  It's not always been like this.
[01:15:29.807 --> 01:15:37.530]  But since the Wahhabists and the Bedouins of Saudi Arabia with all that oil money got control of Islam in the last 50 years, we got a problem, Jack.
[01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:39.311]  We got a big problem.
[01:15:39.431 --> 01:15:42.412]  And you notice Trump went to Saudi Arabia first and said, knock it off!
[01:15:43.379 --> 01:15:49.706]  And believe me, when he was over there, they had, and I'm not even saying this is a good thing, but they had thousands of people hanging up by their ankles.
[01:15:50.987 --> 01:15:53.550]  The Al-Qaeda people got killed.
[01:15:54.731 --> 01:15:59.716]  All the princes that weren't in line, they got waterboarded and hung up by their ankles.
[01:16:04.895 --> 01:16:23.186]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm not gonna speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:16:23.286 --> 01:16:28.710]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:30.251]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:16:30.371 --> 01:16:33.533]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:35.154]  And so much more.
[01:16:35.694 --> 01:16:36.835]  It is concentrated.
[01:16:37.075 --> 01:16:38.776]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:16:38.796 --> 01:16:44.481]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:16:44.601 --> 01:16:45.822]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:16:45.942 --> 01:16:47.743]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:16:47.843 --> 01:16:50.225]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:16:50.425 --> 01:16:51.686]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:16:51.866 --> 01:16:53.667]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:16:54.248 --> 01:16:54.848]  Immune Wall.
[01:16:54.968 --> 01:16:56.269]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:56.389 --> 01:16:57.570]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:17:03.007 --> 01:17:10.249]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:18.172]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:17:18.552 --> 01:17:21.633]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:17:22.273 --> 01:17:26.555]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:17:26.915 --> 01:17:30.836]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:17:31.036 --> 01:17:33.777]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:17:34.197 --> 01:17:38.379]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:17:38.959 --> 01:17:41.960]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:57.246]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.787]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:17:59.027 --> 01:18:01.288]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:10.351]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:18:10.391 --> 01:18:10.891]  You're on the air.
[01:18:10.911 --> 01:18:11.451]  Thanks for holding.
[01:18:11.852 --> 01:18:12.952]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:18:13.152 --> 01:18:13.772]  Hey, brother.
[01:18:14.072 --> 01:18:14.432]  Good, man.
[01:18:14.452 --> 01:18:15.253]  Thank you for calling.
[01:18:15.353 --> 01:18:15.873]  Hey, hey.
[01:18:15.993 --> 01:18:20.415]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:18:20.615 --> 01:18:26.977]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:18:26.997 --> 01:18:28.817]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[01:18:28.897 --> 01:18:35.700]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:37.340]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.821]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[01:18:39.841 --> 01:18:41.402]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:18:41.782 --> 01:18:43.363]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:18:43.843 --> 01:18:44.583]  And exactly.
[01:18:44.603 --> 01:18:48.825]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:18:49.205 --> 01:18:49.465]  Boom!
[01:18:49.605 --> 01:18:52.446]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:18:52.506 --> 01:18:53.046]  It's amazing.
[01:18:53.066 --> 01:18:54.387]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[01:18:54.447 --> 01:18:57.328]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:19:02.748 --> 01:19:04.109]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:19:04.409 --> 01:19:05.710]  You can't survive without it.
[01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:06.790]  But where do you get it?
[01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:12.854]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:19:13.074 --> 01:19:18.777]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:19:18.977 --> 01:19:35.844]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:19:36.244 --> 01:19:38.365]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:19:38.726 --> 01:19:39.926]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:19:40.187 --> 01:19:40.967]  Easy assembly.
[01:19:41.227 --> 01:19:41.868]  Low maintenance.
[01:19:42.148 --> 01:19:43.969]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:20:06.349 --> 01:20:17.311]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.732 --> 01:20:27.553]  You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[01:20:29.174 --> 01:20:34.255]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:38.387 --> 01:20:46.012]  Okay, while we're all focused on the Israel situation, there's so much other news.
[01:20:47.053 --> 01:20:50.595]  I'm gonna cover this a little bit later when Milo Yiannopoulos is in studio with us here.
[01:20:51.576 --> 01:21:05.025]  BuzzFeed has an article out talking about there's a new feature with Facebook letting you know when there's Russian bots involved.
[01:21:06.479 --> 01:21:17.685]  Well, I mean, a Russian website, or a Russian web crawler, or a Russian sock puppet, every country, every company has these, that's involved in this, can go out and post things.
[01:21:18.025 --> 01:21:23.327]  Just because somebody posts something, send an article you have, with a thousand comments, doesn't mean you're a Russian agent.
[01:21:24.548 --> 01:21:35.334]  They have us in there, because Dan Lyman is setting up a European bureau, and he lives in Switzerland with his wife.
[01:21:35.374 --> 01:21:36.094]  He's an American.
[01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:40.351]  That's coming up.
[01:21:40.751 --> 01:21:54.208]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, so now there's this idea that if you are independent media and you have a foreign bureau that you're run by.
[01:22:00.134 --> 01:22:04.035]  And it says that it has a manager in Switzerland.
[01:22:04.195 --> 01:22:06.116]  What does that even mean?
[01:22:06.556 --> 01:22:09.437]  You know why we have a Europe Bureau?
[01:22:09.777 --> 01:22:11.418]  Because we're on planet Earth.
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:19.761]  And it's great having somebody seven, eight hours ahead of us.
[01:22:21.421 --> 01:22:23.402]  And we got Paul Watson and his brother Steve Watson.
[01:22:23.842 --> 01:22:26.543]  But see, they didn't say, look, he's far and run.
[01:22:30.461 --> 01:22:32.242]  I hadn't even seen that one article you put up, good lord.
[01:22:37.384 --> 01:22:38.945]  Look, he's far and run now.
[01:22:39.225 --> 01:22:46.489]  They don't go, oh look, from England, because England's too friendly to us, you know, we celebrate the Queen and all this other weird anti-American stuff now.
[01:22:46.969 --> 01:22:51.471]  So that's not alien enough, but... Did I tell you Infowars is managed?
[01:22:52.271 --> 01:22:53.272]  From Switzerland?
[01:22:53.632 --> 01:22:53.852]  Yeah.
[01:22:54.492 --> 01:22:55.293]  Well, I sure wish.
[01:22:56.536 --> 01:22:59.398]  You know, this morning, Dan Lyman, I wish he'd have told me what I should cover first.
[01:22:59.739 --> 01:23:01.960]  That's like Maxine Waters, Mad Maxine.
[01:23:03.622 --> 01:23:05.864]  We gotta find that clip again where she says, Putin!
[01:23:06.304 --> 01:23:08.866]  He tells Trump what to do, the slogans!
[01:23:09.286 --> 01:23:10.928]  Drain the swamp, lock her up!
[01:23:11.428 --> 01:23:13.410]  Putin told Trump that over the phone!
[01:23:15.211 --> 01:23:16.772]  You're like, you're a lunatic, lady!
[01:23:19.595 --> 01:23:20.776]  Unbelievable.
[01:23:20.836 --> 01:23:22.157]  I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[01:23:23.223 --> 01:23:34.529]  Like, I meant to cover the Jade Helm thing, that's it, all over the news, everywhere, saying that the Russians ran that and told me to say there was a military exercise called Jade Helm that was going to take over Texas.
[01:23:34.829 --> 01:23:36.250]  I never said they were taking over Texas.
[01:23:37.331 --> 01:23:42.874]  It listed Texas as hostile and said it was a drill to practice martial law, which they later confirmed.
[01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:46.871]  But this is the level of disinfo.
[01:23:47.592 --> 01:23:52.095]  There are no Russian influences here, but Daria, who's been in the U.S.
[01:23:52.175 --> 01:23:54.677]  Army and her parents moved over here to get away from the Soviet Union.
[01:23:55.658 --> 01:23:56.919]  And I tell you, she's a great employee.
[01:23:56.939 --> 01:23:57.920]  We need to find some more Russians.
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.561]  If they're all this good.
[01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:09.629]  But, I mean, imagine in America, I gotta sit here and say to the liberals, who are always about open, free society and all this stuff, hey, I'm
[01:24:11.021 --> 01:24:14.403]  Not a Russian, and it's okay to have somebody with a Russian background work here, right?
[01:24:16.625 --> 01:24:17.866]  Like, it's okay, right?
[01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:20.787]  Because you're like, worse than McCarthy could have ever imagined.
[01:24:21.208 --> 01:24:25.130]  McCarthy was going after real communists in our government, and it turned out he was correct.
[01:24:26.211 --> 01:24:29.353]  Remember he said, it's weird, big foundations and the army are involved.
[01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:32.175]  I've now learned at the highest levels, propping up the Soviet Union.
[01:24:32.555 --> 01:24:34.076]  That's when the witch hunt was ended.
[01:24:35.517 --> 01:24:38.059]  When he was just setting up a police state, the globalists liked it.
[01:24:39.261 --> 01:24:48.069]  But as soon as he went, wait a minute, we're running it from here, it was like, oh no, it was like a record skipping or a car wrecking, that noise when it slams on the brakes.
[01:24:53.594 --> 01:24:57.598]  No, no, no, McCartney, you're too good a bloodhound.
[01:24:58.038 --> 01:25:00.781]  You actually found out the whole paradigm conspiracy.
[01:25:01.937 --> 01:25:06.081]  Just like they said, oh, we never wiretap the president-elect or the president.
[01:25:06.681 --> 01:25:09.223]  Oh, there's no conspiracy of a bunch of Democrats to do that.
[01:25:09.424 --> 01:25:11.185]  And of course, they did do it illegally.
[01:25:11.405 --> 01:25:13.327]  They did lie to Congress, and it's a conspiracy.
[01:25:18.993 --> 01:25:22.076]  So I'm yet to get to Netanyahu, but I was out there during the break.
[01:25:22.236 --> 01:25:32.504]  We have CNN on in the coffee room and it's like, Netanyahu's got blood on his hands, 50-something dead, yeah, rioting people, throwing rocks and, you know, suicide bombers and the rest of it.
[01:25:35.587 --> 01:25:37.288]  And then now it's all Netanyahu's fault.
[01:25:37.348 --> 01:25:39.130]  And again, I'm not even defending Netanyahu.
[01:25:39.150 --> 01:25:40.151]  There's stuff about him I don't like.
[01:25:40.551 --> 01:25:46.136]  But every time Israel does something, it's all over the news and we know about it and it's an outrage.
[01:25:48.181 --> 01:26:03.406]  Just like when there's a school shooting, we hear about it at nauseam, but the thousands of stabbing deaths, or the thousands of baseball killings, or the thousands of murders in Chicago every year, got 50-something kids killed in mass shootings every year on average.
[01:26:03.426 --> 01:26:03.706]  50-something!
[01:26:03.726 --> 01:26:04.627]  That's a terrible number, but...
[01:26:05.581 --> 01:26:08.903]  Over 2,000 killed every year in Chicago for a decade running.
[01:26:10.324 --> 01:26:11.124]  4,000 plus shot.
[01:26:11.924 --> 01:26:13.145]  You don't know their names.
[01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:19.508]  You don't take those victims and put them up and they're like cause celebs, household names like David Hogg.
[01:26:21.589 --> 01:26:28.993]  Again, they ran ads in the mid-80s and the late 70s, early 70s, over and over again after Jaws came out.
[01:26:29.033 --> 01:26:31.394]  When new Jawses would come out, they would see at
[01:26:32.674 --> 01:26:34.615]  Seashore towns up to 50%.
[01:26:34.895 --> 01:26:35.955]  You can look this up.
[01:26:36.836 --> 01:26:38.977]  50% reductions in people coming to the beach.
[01:26:41.978 --> 01:26:47.961]  You've got on average 7 to 10 great white killings globally every year, most of them in Australia.
[01:26:49.321 --> 01:26:55.364]  But people all think that if you go swimming, Jaws is going to eat you.
[01:26:56.905 --> 01:27:01.967]  Got a better chance stepping on a dirty needle or glass or, you know, stepping on a stingray or something.
[01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:05.858]  But you know, you don't have a big chance of a great white shark eating you.
[01:27:06.498 --> 01:27:14.441]  Maybe a couple hundred shark deaths total a year, but there's a perception that it is absolutely everywhere, just like Israel.
[01:27:16.182 --> 01:27:23.205]  Everything Israel does, we know all about, we hear all about constantly in the so-called pro-Israel media here in the U.S., but that's not what it is.
[01:27:24.045 --> 01:27:25.806]  They want the Vatican and the U.N.
[01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:29.427]  running Israel as part of this world government plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:29.967 --> 01:27:30.908]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[01:27:31.088 --> 01:27:31.908]  I got sidetracked.
[01:27:33.015 --> 01:27:34.196]  But this is incredible.
[01:27:35.978 --> 01:27:37.099]  This is amazing.
[01:27:43.285 --> 01:27:50.552]  Notice the new Facebook feature doesn't show you other Facebook things that are run from overseas, only pro-Trump.
[01:27:50.592 --> 01:27:54.816]  See, we're being singled out and I can't believe they couldn't find
[01:27:57.699 --> 01:27:59.659]  A Russian bot or two, and Russia's a big country.
[01:27:59.679 --> 01:28:01.320]  There's gotta be somebody in Russia promoting InfoWars.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.820]  We got a lot of fans over there.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.520]  They call anybody, you know, a bot.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:05.600]  They call me a bot.
[01:28:06.401 --> 01:28:08.581]  But, think about that.
[01:28:09.361 --> 01:28:11.121]  They, all they could find was Switzerland.
[01:28:15.242 --> 01:28:18.383]  Well, we're gonna go to break, cover all this with Milo on the other side.
[01:28:18.443 --> 01:28:26.124]  By the way, Stormy Daniels' lawyer, like I said, I don't normally cover Stormy Daniels, but she's really getting in hot water now, and her lawyer is lashing out and threatening to sue people.
[01:28:27.506 --> 01:28:29.028]  If they talk about his past or anything.
[01:28:29.528 --> 01:28:30.870]  You're a public figure, bro.
[01:28:32.151 --> 01:28:33.372]  So, that's all coming up.
[01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:35.254]  And so much more.
[01:28:35.375 --> 01:28:36.436]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:36.836 --> 01:28:37.837]  Newswars.com.
[01:28:38.278 --> 01:28:39.599]  I haven't even plugged yet this hour.
[01:28:39.659 --> 01:28:49.430]  We've got a bunch of specials, 50% off, that are about to end on the fluoride-free, super blue family of toothpaste and dental health care products.
[01:28:50.865 --> 01:28:59.604]  Dental hygiene products, 50% off also on bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 40% off on Icarin, liver and kidney cleanse, and so much more.
[01:28:59.644 --> 01:29:01.268]  But a lot of these specials are about to end.
[01:29:02.267 --> 01:29:09.949]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:14.891]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:17.732]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:29:18.532 --> 01:29:21.633]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:35.286]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:29:35.986 --> 01:29:51.053]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:55.754]  Find out for yourself today at Infowarsstore.com what it could do for your family.
[01:29:56.315 --> 01:29:58.015]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:29:58.055 --> 01:30:00.436]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[01:30:00.516 --> 01:30:06.958]  How come Hollywood embraces
[01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:11.315]  This madman, this director, who raped a 13-year-old.
[01:30:11.956 --> 01:30:13.258]  He didn't rape a 13-year-old.
[01:30:13.298 --> 01:30:14.420]  It was statutory rape.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:15.301]  Yeah, alright.
[01:30:15.341 --> 01:30:17.644]  Well, it's not statutory rape.
[01:30:17.905 --> 01:30:19.767]  He had sex with a minor.
[01:30:20.288 --> 01:30:21.970]  That's not rape.
[01:30:21.991 --> 01:30:24.074]  He was guilty of having sex with a minor.
[01:30:24.414 --> 01:30:25.575]  That she didn't want to have.
[01:30:25.695 --> 01:30:27.156]  No, that was not the case at all.
[01:30:27.236 --> 01:30:28.297]  She wanted to have it.
[01:30:28.377 --> 01:30:31.559]  Well, in the transcripts... Dated the guy.
[01:30:31.919 --> 01:30:32.800]  Dated the guy.
[01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:34.261]  She was 13!
[01:30:34.621 --> 01:30:35.342]  And found out.
[01:30:35.762 --> 01:30:37.964]  By the way, we're talking about America's morals.
[01:30:37.984 --> 01:30:40.285]  We're not talking about the morals in Europe and everything.
[01:30:41.466 --> 01:30:42.547]  Wait a second.
[01:30:42.587 --> 01:30:46.129]  You have sex with a 13-year-old girl and you're in a grown man.
[01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:48.331]  You know that that's wrong.
[01:30:48.371 --> 01:30:51.313]  You're giving her booze and pills.
[01:30:51.453 --> 01:30:52.534]  I'm not... Look.
[01:30:53.294 --> 01:30:54.434]  She was down with it.
[01:30:54.714 --> 01:30:55.054]  Oh, yeah.
[01:30:55.114 --> 01:30:56.515]  Crazy.
[01:30:56.615 --> 01:30:57.835]  And she's talked about it.
[01:30:57.875 --> 01:30:58.795]  She's talked about it.
[01:30:59.155 --> 01:31:01.736]  Why would he defend Roman Polanski and pedophilia?
[01:31:02.336 --> 01:31:04.737]  And then why, I mean, why is he so arrogant?
[01:31:04.777 --> 01:31:06.717]  And why is he being protected by Hollywood?
[01:31:07.997 --> 01:31:10.158]  You know, that's a damn good question.
[01:31:10.178 --> 01:31:14.219]  The only thing I can come up with is because of power.
[01:31:15.365 --> 01:31:19.269]  You know, money and power within the industry.
[01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:29.679]  It's just the same thing that Weinstein was accused of, telling women they'd be blackballed, they'd never work again if they didn't submit to his commands.
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:36.145]  And basically, in my opinion, that's the same strength of the same position.
[01:31:40.128 --> 01:31:48.855]  When you look at Roman Polanski, what he's been able to get away with because, again, of his recognition of his position.
[01:31:49.235 --> 01:32:05.548]  These people, all of them, regardless of who they are, they become so full of themselves and self-importance and power within the industry that they basically feel they're above the law, they're above reproach, and they get away with any damn thing they feel like.
[01:32:06.168 --> 01:32:15.650]  And when you listen to some of the idiotic things that he has said, not just now, but all through his career, ever since he became well-known.
[01:32:16.711 --> 01:32:18.611]  And to me, that's really too bad.
[01:32:18.651 --> 01:32:23.172]  Hey, I'm an actor, but I'm no different than anybody else.
[01:32:23.212 --> 01:32:24.593]  That's what I do for a living.
[01:32:24.653 --> 01:32:30.074]  That doesn't make me, you know, above anybody else in any other way.
[01:32:31.614 --> 01:32:33.595]  It's just what you do for a living.
[01:32:34.816 --> 01:32:35.977]  You have a job.
[01:32:36.777 --> 01:32:39.538]  You have what you do for a living and you're good at it.
[01:32:39.858 --> 01:32:47.962]  But that doesn't set you up against the rest of the world and make you any better of a person than anybody else.
[01:32:47.982 --> 01:32:52.464]  And people that take that attitude and think they are, they're sick.
[01:32:53.625 --> 01:32:54.965]  They have a real problem.
[01:32:55.045 --> 01:32:56.706]  They need to come back down to earth.
[01:32:56.786 --> 01:32:58.187]  Somebody needs to put them there.
[01:33:05.814 --> 01:33:08.421]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.834 --> 01:33:15.674]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.774 --> 01:33:16.155]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.355 --> 01:33:17.015]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.035 --> 01:33:21.976]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.136 --> 01:33:31.559]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[01:33:31.599 --> 01:33:33.340]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:33:38.601 --> 01:33:42.925]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:33:42.965 --> 01:33:43.326]  J.F.
[01:33:43.426 --> 01:33:46.129]  King was shot from the back and the front.
[01:33:46.209 --> 01:33:49.552]  It was almost as if there were plants imploding.
[01:33:49.812 --> 01:33:51.114]  It just pancaked.
[01:33:51.214 --> 01:33:55.198]  It took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the front lines.
[01:33:55.939 --> 01:33:57.720]  I think this is a national security emergency.
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:05.303]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[01:34:05.383 --> 01:34:06.343]  UFOs.
[01:34:06.383 --> 01:34:08.384]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:34:08.504 --> 01:34:09.425]  Is it one world?
[01:34:09.505 --> 01:34:10.925]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:34:10.985 --> 01:34:14.307]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former U.S.
[01:34:14.367 --> 01:34:16.428]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:34:16.468 --> 01:34:19.789]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:34:19.969 --> 01:34:25.534]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:34:25.595 --> 01:34:26.956]  Russian scum!
[01:34:27.116 --> 01:34:27.917]  Denied everything.
[01:34:27.957 --> 01:34:29.378]  He called it all fake news.
[01:34:29.438 --> 01:34:32.281]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:34:32.361 --> 01:34:34.263]  This is a national emergency.
[01:34:34.363 --> 01:34:40.049]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:41.510]  This is a team to high level.
[01:34:44.872 --> 01:34:48.694]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:34:48.714 --> 01:34:49.254]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:35:07.873 --> 01:35:10.116]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[01:35:10.496 --> 01:35:16.063]  And we have Milo Yiannopoulos, best-selling author, firebrand, Patriot in the studio with us for the next hour.
[01:35:16.403 --> 01:35:21.950]  Then the man running against Mad Dog, Maxine Waters, is going to be joining us.
[01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:23.672]  Mr. Navarro is going to be joining us.
[01:35:23.712 --> 01:35:25.194]  That should be very, very... Brave man.
[01:35:25.515 --> 01:35:26.235]  Very, very interesting.
[01:35:26.916 --> 01:35:27.377]  She's vicious.
[01:35:27.677 --> 01:35:39.025]  She's, well, she's sort of got that thing, you know, like I always say about liberals who are really up against it, you know, like a dog that's just about to die, and they get sort of the most vicious and deranged just before, just before they expire.
[01:35:39.286 --> 01:35:43.449]  Sort of being kicked to death, and it doesn't care anymore, and it'll lash out and bite.
[01:35:43.509 --> 01:35:44.850]  She's got that sort of look on her face.
[01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:49.473]  Well, listen, she starred, she starred in The Dark Crystal back in the early 80s.
[01:35:50.794 --> 01:35:51.555]  The Skeksis!
[01:35:51.595 --> 01:35:53.617]  Yeah, I mean, so she's been, you know, around a while.
[01:35:53.637 --> 01:35:57.760]  You know, she also played Darth Sidious in Episode 4 of Star Wars.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.924]  It's funny because they keep having these errors in the credits where they credit somebody else for the role, and she must be very mad.
[01:36:03.705 --> 01:36:04.566]  Yeah, she's amazing.
[01:36:04.586 --> 01:36:07.068]  No, but getting serious here, you've got a lot on your plate.
[01:36:07.088 --> 01:36:09.870]  I got a lot of questions, things I want to talk to you about, about the war on free speech.
[01:36:10.271 --> 01:36:11.432]  You were kind of patient zero.
[01:36:11.452 --> 01:36:12.473]  They went after you first.
[01:36:12.973 --> 01:36:16.776]  Now they're doing it to everybody, but this latest thing is right here.
[01:36:17.802 --> 01:36:25.926]  Facebook goes, oh look, we have a feature that shows which pro-Trump Facebook pages are run from overseas, Milo.
[01:36:26.927 --> 01:36:33.150]  And it goes, oh my god, someone's posting officially on InfoWars from Switzerland, showing where foreign runs.
[01:36:33.170 --> 01:36:36.611]  So now it's not even Russian, because they can't find anything Russian going on there.
[01:36:36.772 --> 01:36:38.853]  They're now claiming that InfoWars is Swiss.
[01:36:39.773 --> 01:36:41.155]  It's a Swiss conspiracy!
[01:36:41.275 --> 01:36:42.456]  All the best things in the world.
[01:36:42.576 --> 01:36:45.119]  Chocolate, peace, brotherly love, and Infowars.
[01:36:45.139 --> 01:36:46.140]  They're all from Switzerland.
[01:36:46.481 --> 01:36:54.370]  Well, we have a reporter who's married a European lady, but he's Dan Lyman, and he reports for us from Switzerland.
[01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:54.970]  Right.
[01:36:55.350 --> 01:37:03.854]  But now, I guess, if like... Gosh, if you're an international news organization that happens to have a bureau somewhere, what happens to the BBC's Moscow bureau?
[01:37:03.874 --> 01:37:06.195]  Are they suddenly going to be posting from Russia?
[01:37:06.495 --> 01:37:09.396]  What about CNN when they dispatch reporters to Damascus?
[01:37:09.456 --> 01:37:11.257]  Well, that's what I'm getting at.
[01:37:11.317 --> 01:37:15.599]  These tricks they're playing to claim we're far and run are getting more ridiculous.
[01:37:16.179 --> 01:37:19.920]  This is about the most American company I've ever walked in, I've got to tell you.
[01:37:20.661 --> 01:37:24.022]  No, this is a perfect example of their selective application of rules.
[01:37:24.082 --> 01:37:28.143]  Rules that are deliberately kept vague, deliberately kept ill-defined.
[01:37:28.203 --> 01:37:29.764]  Twitter is of course the master at this.
[01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:37.547]  They have abuse and harassment and targeted you-know-what rules, which it's never really made clear and they refuse to make it clear what they mean by any of that stuff.
[01:37:38.007 --> 01:37:38.888]  And they do that on purpose.
[01:37:38.928 --> 01:37:42.531]  They do it so that they can selectively apply those rules to damage their ideology.
[01:37:42.571 --> 01:37:43.932]  What did you make of the CEO?
[01:37:44.172 --> 01:37:47.475]  Because you said he's launching a jihad against conservatives, libertarians, free thinkers.
[01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:54.181]  He came out, Jack Dorsey, as you know, a month ago and said, we're in a civil war and we're going to, quote, crush conservatives.
[01:37:54.481 --> 01:37:54.721]  Oh yeah.
[01:37:54.781 --> 01:37:55.102]  Wow.
[01:37:55.242 --> 01:38:01.347]  A Medium post that said there can be no more reconciliation between Republicans and Democrats.
[01:38:01.587 --> 01:38:05.210]  There can be no more, you know, happy, all getting along, whatever.
[01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:10.133]  What needs to happen now in America is that the Republicans need to be effectively extinguished.
[01:38:10.173 --> 01:38:12.255]  They need to be eradicated from public life.
[01:38:12.515 --> 01:38:17.118]  And that's what the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, reposted on Twitter with his endorsement.
[01:38:17.138 --> 01:38:18.539]  He's like, yes, this is very thoughtful.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.562]  You know, it was one of his co-founders, and Jack Dorsey retweeted it.
[01:38:21.602 --> 01:38:27.886]  We already know, of course, through the principles and practices and behavior of the company that he runs, what his beliefs are.
[01:38:28.147 --> 01:38:29.988]  But increasingly, they're not even trying to hide it anymore.
[01:38:30.188 --> 01:38:32.250]  This is not a neutral public platform.
[01:38:32.610 --> 01:38:36.114]  This is not a platform that is welcoming of all political views.
[01:38:36.434 --> 01:38:46.263]  Twitter, just like Facebook, just like all these other Silicon Valley giants, are now being increasingly brazen about the fact that conservatives are the enemy and they want to extinguish us wherever they can.
[01:38:46.924 --> 01:38:48.105]  Or even just libertarians, of course.
[01:38:48.145 --> 01:38:50.607]  But they're such classically the bad guys.
[01:38:51.448 --> 01:38:53.650]  And then they misrepresent what we've said to ban us.
[01:38:53.670 --> 01:38:56.852]  They banned you for making fun of the new women's Ghostbusters.
[01:38:57.032 --> 01:38:58.633]  The one thing they fear more than anything is humor.
[01:38:59.294 --> 01:39:02.056]  When we put something out really funny, that's when they block it.
[01:39:02.076 --> 01:39:03.277]  That's the one they go for.
[01:39:03.517 --> 01:39:05.619]  That's why they got me off Twitter.
[01:39:05.639 --> 01:39:10.883]  And it's interesting, my team on Facebook, we have a small team that runs the Facebook page, just a couple of guys.
[01:39:12.924 --> 01:39:13.184]  Check out
[01:39:28.803 --> 01:39:29.644]  It wraps it up.
[01:39:29.664 --> 01:39:31.925]  It makes you just want to go just to upset them.
[01:39:31.945 --> 01:39:32.826]  Just to get under their skin.
[01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:35.307]  I mean, Lauren Southern, I think, has gone over to Russia.
[01:39:35.387 --> 01:39:36.628]  I don't even know what she's doing over there.
[01:39:36.648 --> 01:39:37.869]  It's just amusing that she's there.
[01:39:37.889 --> 01:39:39.330]  I think it's annoying people just being there.
[01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:41.552]  We should all do some kind of pilgrimage to Moscow.
[01:39:41.632 --> 01:39:43.073]  I want to go to Israel first.
[01:39:43.113 --> 01:39:44.453]  Because I've always wanted to go to Israel.
[01:39:44.473 --> 01:39:45.114]  It's so historic.
[01:39:45.154 --> 01:39:48.256]  But also, they always accuse me of working for Israel because I don't want to blow Israel up.
[01:39:48.816 --> 01:39:51.378]  Plus, even if I hated Israel, which I don't, they have 200 nukes.
[01:39:51.478 --> 01:39:52.379]  They're not going to go away.
[01:39:54.036 --> 01:39:54.856]  That's a whole other subject.
[01:39:54.916 --> 01:39:55.816]  Yes.
[01:39:55.836 --> 01:40:17.000]  I mean, what's becoming increasingly obvious is this nexus of, you know, established media, Silicon Valley companies, you know, all the various powers in the American establishment, in civil society, are now rounding on anyone who, you know, is sufficiently brave to express an opinion that wanders outside the, you know, of the mainstream.
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:21.221]  Which, by the way, not wanting to blow Israel up, just not hating Israel,
[01:40:21.841 --> 01:40:24.962]  How did the media go from being somewhat pro-Israel to like... No, no, that's it.
[01:40:24.982 --> 01:40:25.822]  That's a hate crime now.
[01:40:25.882 --> 01:40:34.365]  You know, not describing Israel as barbaric, human rights violating, apartheid enforcing, conquering.
[01:40:34.606 --> 01:40:40.728]  Well, of course, Israel is committing the ultimate historical sin, according to the left, which is colonialism, by conquering more lands around it.
[01:40:40.748 --> 01:40:43.369]  You know, it's like, oh, they're just as bad as... And then everybody wants in.
[01:40:43.489 --> 01:40:45.970]  Everybody wants into America or they want into Israel.
[01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.270]  They want...
[01:40:47.490 --> 01:40:50.312]  Everyone wants to get away from Islam to turn it back into Islam.
[01:40:50.512 --> 01:40:54.135]  And everyone wants to get out of California to turn Austin into California.
[01:40:54.215 --> 01:41:03.021]  This is a country that is surrounded by aggressive, violent terrorists who are constantly hurling missiles, you know, across the border and all the rest of it.
[01:41:03.041 --> 01:41:03.981]  And blowing their kids up.
[01:41:04.482 --> 01:41:05.722]  And here's my deal.
[01:41:05.942 --> 01:41:15.029]  The media never covers when the Arabs are killing each other by the millions, but then when a bunch of rioters are trying to break into Israel and some get killed, and I'm sad that happened, it's like, oh my god!
[01:41:17.778 --> 01:41:24.387]  35,000, you know, they call them protesters, which we know is media code for left-wing riots.
[01:41:24.407 --> 01:41:26.950]  Oh, did you hear there was like four or five suicide bombers today?
[01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:28.072]  Little kids that got blown up.
[01:41:28.312 --> 01:41:29.774]  Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years old.
[01:41:29.934 --> 01:41:30.615]  They're protesters.
[01:41:30.996 --> 01:41:34.140]  Oh, well, you know, if it went poorly, one little girl, like, blew 30 feet in the air.
[01:41:35.529 --> 01:41:46.672]  When the Palestinians do this stuff, it is of course them reaching for desperate means to express themselves and to reclaim their historical heritage after the horrors have been inflicted on them.
[01:41:46.832 --> 01:41:48.853]  I'm just not going with them.
[01:41:48.953 --> 01:41:57.735]  I used to be more neutral on this, but now the whole leftist media, and George Soros has confirmed to want to destroy Israel, it's like, wow, I have the same enemies Israel does.
[01:41:58.235 --> 01:41:58.716]  Exactly.
[01:41:58.736 --> 01:42:03.482]  I was never really, I mean, you know, I'm Jewish, my mom's Jewish, but I was raised Catholic.
[01:42:03.502 --> 01:42:07.347]  I've never had a particular affinity for the Jewish faith or Jewish people enormously, especially.
[01:42:07.728 --> 01:42:10.431]  I was always fairly neutral on the Israel-Palestine question.
[01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:12.454]  I could kind of see bits of both sides.
[01:42:12.594 --> 01:42:12.814]  Me too.
[01:42:14.256 --> 01:42:26.395]  I gotta say, we live in an era where you gotta, like, you know, my enemy, when I look at the massed ranks of the enemy, all the people who hate me, the people who hate you... Billions of Muslims, and everybody, how many, what is it, 40 million in Israel?
[01:42:26.755 --> 01:42:29.820]  We gotta blow Israel up, it's a little tiny place, but Islam gets everything!
[01:42:30.601 --> 01:42:44.078]  When I look at the hypocrisy and the double standards and the utterly uniform opinion about this country, and I see the same thing happening with respect to Israel that has happened to me and my friends and the people I admire, it tells me very clearly who the bad guys really are.
[01:42:44.358 --> 01:42:45.319]  So, you know, sign me up.
[01:42:45.399 --> 01:42:49.104]  I will be the last unreconstructed Zionist in America, if that's what
[01:42:49.484 --> 01:42:54.429]  All I know is, well look at how the Globals want to take down George Washington statues now.
[01:42:54.689 --> 01:42:55.991]  It's the same stuff here, man.
[01:42:56.611 --> 01:42:59.214]  It's communist garbage funded by billionaires.
[01:42:59.234 --> 01:43:00.035]  We'll be back with Milo.
[01:43:02.475 --> 01:43:08.481]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:43:08.861 --> 01:43:11.464]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:43:12.065 --> 01:43:15.528]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:15.768 --> 01:43:20.053]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:43:20.473 --> 01:43:23.736]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:24.637 --> 01:43:34.868]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:44.178]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:54.343]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[01:43:54.843 --> 01:43:59.124]  Try Bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:03.137 --> 01:44:03.878]  I'm so excited.
[01:44:03.958 --> 01:44:13.504]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:14.104 --> 01:44:19.288]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:19.608 --> 01:44:22.410]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:22.610 --> 01:44:31.376]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:33.477 --> 01:44:52.592]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:53.092 --> 01:44:54.373]  It is amazing!
[01:44:55.754 --> 01:45:00.738]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:45:02.492 --> 01:45:06.315]  With Alpha Power by InfoWars Life, you can be in charge of your energy again.
[01:45:06.635 --> 01:45:11.578]  Alpha Power helps with a large amount of functions for your body to help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[01:45:11.838 --> 01:45:15.481]  Alpha Power has a 4.8 star rating on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:15.761 --> 01:45:19.303]  Listen to all these incredible 5 star reviews from verified buyers.
[01:45:19.643 --> 01:45:20.684]  Papa Black Wilson says,
[01:45:32.492 --> 01:45:34.834]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[01:45:35.054 --> 01:45:36.756]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[01:45:36.956 --> 01:45:39.618]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[01:45:39.858 --> 01:45:44.402]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[01:45:44.723 --> 01:45:50.808]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[01:45:51.248 --> 01:45:55.732]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[01:45:55.752 --> 01:45:58.755]  It helps with focus too, like Brain Force Plus.
[01:45:59.295 --> 01:46:03.396]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products and they're always of supreme quality.
[01:46:03.816 --> 01:46:07.857]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[01:46:08.137 --> 01:46:09.678]  There's definitely been a change.
[01:46:09.938 --> 01:46:10.578]  For the better.
[01:46:11.018 --> 01:46:14.779]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased and that's fine by me.
[01:46:15.179 --> 01:46:16.860]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.160]  I hope this lasts.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.063]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[01:46:21.363 --> 01:46:27.491]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes, I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[01:46:27.771 --> 01:46:32.738]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:36.462]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[01:46:37.083 --> 01:46:38.705]  Taking one capsule a day in the a.m.
[01:46:38.985 --> 01:46:42.149]  and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[01:46:42.669 --> 01:46:44.471]  I'd feel exhausted after 8 p.m.
[01:46:44.752 --> 01:46:45.272]  Not anymore.
[01:46:45.673 --> 01:46:46.854]  Seem to be sleeping better too.
[01:46:47.414 --> 01:46:49.236]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[01:46:49.497 --> 01:46:50.878]  I will definitely buy this again.
[01:46:51.659 --> 01:46:55.003]  Head to infowarrestore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[01:46:55.683 --> 01:46:57.445]  That's infowarrestore.com.
[01:47:06.731 --> 01:47:09.345]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.992 --> 01:47:34.481]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:39.367]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:39.828 --> 01:47:43.652]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:47:44.013 --> 01:47:45.635]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:46.155 --> 01:47:53.120]  You know, I've been trying to get Milo on for about three weeks since there was that viral video of him in New York, people chanting, Nazi, Nazi, get out.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:54.221]  So I just was reminded that.
[01:47:54.241 --> 01:47:56.962]  We'll play that in a minute and just get into this whole free speech issue.
[01:47:56.982 --> 01:47:59.324]  But that almost happens to me now when I go out.
[01:47:59.384 --> 01:48:00.445]  Most people shake my hand.
[01:48:00.485 --> 01:48:03.307]  A lot of classical liberals like me when I go to downtown Austin.
[01:48:03.327 --> 01:48:09.031]  But there's that trendy type that thinks it's a coming of age to get Alex Jones or get Milo Yiannopoulos.
[01:48:09.051 --> 01:48:11.232]  We'll talk about that and a bunch of other issues.
[01:48:11.352 --> 01:48:14.094]  And then I'll try to open the phones up some for Milo in the next hour.
[01:48:14.114 --> 01:48:15.135]  Before we go any further,
[01:48:16.172 --> 01:48:21.897]  We're talking about the article that they put out about Paul Watson and I, and Paul Watson's taking my crown.
[01:48:21.917 --> 01:48:23.639]  I said, what'd you think of that article, Milo?
[01:48:23.679 --> 01:48:24.059]  He'd read it.
[01:48:24.079 --> 01:48:27.082]  He said, let's drive a wedge between two, you know, dynamic duo.
[01:48:27.122 --> 01:48:28.223]  Well, of course, Paul knows that.
[01:48:28.263 --> 01:48:28.584]  I know that.
[01:48:28.604 --> 01:48:30.966]  But I went on and said, well, what about all these fake lawsuits?
[01:48:30.986 --> 01:48:31.786]  He goes, well, it's just that.
[01:48:31.807 --> 01:48:32.968]  It's just to drain you.
[01:48:33.028 --> 01:48:36.191]  That's why we're defeating these lawsuits.
[01:48:36.691 --> 01:48:38.493]  A bunch of them have been thrown out, but they file more.
[01:48:39.394 --> 01:48:41.736]  That's why you've got to commit to get products you need.
[01:48:43.482 --> 01:48:49.185]  And to support the broadcast in a military operation, in a free speech operation.
[01:48:49.225 --> 01:48:50.066]  This is an information war.
[01:48:50.166 --> 01:48:51.787]  And we make it easy, folks.
[01:48:51.907 --> 01:48:55.869]  X2 is the purest iodine out there, deep earth crystal source.
[01:48:56.009 --> 01:48:58.910]  I told you they've only got enough of the crystals to do a few more runs.
[01:48:58.930 --> 01:49:01.832]  We think we're going to get another supplier and be able to continue to supply it.
[01:49:01.852 --> 01:49:04.814]  We've only had one of these shortages once before in the last five years.
[01:49:05.314 --> 01:49:06.975]  X2, the good halogen, back in stock.
[01:49:08.516 --> 01:49:12.437]  And I'm going to offer it for 25% off again, because I want you to try it.
[01:49:12.838 --> 01:49:18.260]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcumin, 400 plus milligrams, and it's got five other ingredients as well.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:20.440]  That is 50% off.
[01:49:21.101 --> 01:49:23.462]  We've got the Icarin, liver and kidney cleanse.
[01:49:23.562 --> 01:49:23.942]  Amazing.
[01:49:24.778 --> 01:49:25.378]  Find out about it.
[01:49:25.398 --> 01:49:26.319]  40% off.
[01:49:26.379 --> 01:49:28.780]  We've got all the high-quality fluoride-free toothpaste products.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.441]  Those are 50% off.
[01:49:32.041 --> 01:49:33.602]  But that's got to end in a couple days.
[01:49:34.002 --> 01:49:36.183]  And so does the special on DNA Force.
[01:49:36.203 --> 01:49:37.143]  50% off.
[01:49:37.163 --> 01:49:38.604]  So that is ending Wednesday.
[01:49:38.644 --> 01:49:43.466]  It's got to because both those products are very close to selling out and we won't get more in four months.
[01:49:43.886 --> 01:49:45.247]  So please think about us today.
[01:49:45.267 --> 01:49:47.127]  I want to thank all of you that do financially support us.
[01:49:47.648 --> 01:49:50.569]  But it's where you get a good product at a great price back.
[01:49:50.849 --> 01:49:51.849]  You support free speech.
[01:49:51.869 --> 01:49:52.830]  You support America.
[01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:55.397]  You support trying to get free market back.
[01:49:55.437 --> 01:49:57.704]  You support standing up against the globalists.
[01:49:58.661 --> 01:49:59.782]  We've come so far together.
[01:50:00.222 --> 01:50:02.504]  Just five years ago, they still denied there was world government.
[01:50:02.564 --> 01:50:04.565]  Now they admit their world government is falling apart.
[01:50:04.986 --> 01:50:06.987]  We have come so far, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:07.287 --> 01:50:13.011]  Now, going back to Milo Yiannopoulos, bestselling author of Dangerous.com, hear with us.
[01:50:13.452 --> 01:50:17.715]  As Mark Twain famously said, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[01:50:17.755 --> 01:50:18.635]  They demonize you.
[01:50:18.655 --> 01:50:24.279]  They had fake PR stunts that you were over, that you were destroyed.
[01:50:24.299 --> 01:50:25.941]  They banned you on Twitter, but you're still just
[01:50:26.761 --> 01:50:28.522]  Churning along there, getting the word out.
[01:50:29.043 --> 01:50:44.473]  Well, just like you, I know that all of these things are designed with a piece about you and Paul, which is designed to sort of insinuate itself into your brain and kind of drive a wedge between two people who work brilliantly together, both of whom combined reach, you know, a larger audience than either of you individually will be able to.
[01:50:44.834 --> 01:50:48.016]  It's designed to get into your head like a little worm and just sow the seeds of doubt.
[01:50:48.096 --> 01:50:49.177]  And if you let it, they want.
[01:50:49.277 --> 01:50:50.778]  And it says that I bully Paul.
[01:50:51.278 --> 01:50:51.599]  Yeah.
[01:50:51.759 --> 01:50:53.421]  I mean, it's the opposite.
[01:50:53.881 --> 01:50:58.266]  Paul's like a peer, and usually it's him calling me, saying, you've gone too far.
[01:50:58.907 --> 01:51:02.010]  By left-wing standards, you speaking is bullying.
[01:51:02.110 --> 01:51:06.015]  By left-wing standards, me speaking is bullying, because we're saying something that...
[01:51:08.296 --> 01:51:17.418]  You know, when I worked for Steve Bannon, and I know people have very different opinions about Steve and how he sort of lost his way or whatever, but when I worked with Steve, it was a pretty grueling experience.
[01:51:17.458 --> 01:51:19.339]  You know, he was a hard taskmaster.
[01:51:19.359 --> 01:51:20.619]  He would scream, he would yell.
[01:51:21.419 --> 01:51:23.300]  I mean, he would fire people several times a day.
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:26.841]  Raheem Kassam, the editor of Breitbart London, I think got fired four times in a day.
[01:51:26.861 --> 01:51:28.661]  He said, you're fired, I don't want to hear from you again.
[01:51:28.721 --> 01:51:30.342]  Two hours later, he's like, where's that story I asked for?
[01:51:30.702 --> 01:51:34.403]  That's how a lot of very, you know, that's how a lot of like juggernaut
[01:51:35.083 --> 01:51:37.906]  Highly demanding people in business and media.
[01:51:38.006 --> 01:51:42.550]  Oh, you, by comparison, are a charming pussycat compared to some of the people I've worked with.
[01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:44.031]  So, obviously, these allegations are ridiculous.
[01:51:44.051 --> 01:51:47.274]  I only blow up when I ask for little lower thirds for years.
[01:51:48.495 --> 01:51:50.777]  And I'm not going to get them, so it doesn't matter.
[01:51:51.057 --> 01:51:55.000]  Just a little something at the bottom of the screen that just says who I'm talking to.
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:52:01.366]  No, you know, when I blow up, it's like when my wife calls, and then I got to sign something, and then I like trip on cords.
[01:52:01.906 --> 01:52:06.093]  And then someone else is there, it's like... It's a building thing.
[01:52:06.173 --> 01:52:08.596]  No, no, look, I'm just saying, you know... I rarely blow up.
[01:52:08.897 --> 01:52:15.166]  In terms of... But you read that article, the funniest thing is, remember they finally released a new Beavis and Butthead season after 20 years?
[01:52:15.527 --> 01:52:16.388]  No, I didn't see that.
[01:52:16.969 --> 01:52:23.617]  Well, they've got one where Beavis and Butthead decide they've been sexually harassed because women are telepathically wanting them.
[01:52:24.418 --> 01:52:25.700]  And then they accuse the judge of that.
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:27.322]  Did you know this EEOC complaint against me?
[01:52:27.362 --> 01:52:31.607]  It says, Jones never made homosexual advances, but he telepathically did it.
[01:52:35.792 --> 01:52:38.235]  I mean, that's the standard of proof, you know.
[01:52:38.295 --> 01:52:40.357]  It's just like, well, I'm sure he was thinking it.
[01:52:40.377 --> 01:52:42.360]  This is presumably where sexual harassment is going.
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:47.285]  No, I mean, you know... Well, sure, what did Mike Judge know when he... That was like a couple of years ago that came out.
[01:52:47.786 --> 01:52:49.728]  Like, I'm friends with Mike.
[01:52:49.748 --> 01:52:50.188]  I got to talk to him.
[01:52:50.208 --> 01:52:51.169]  I haven't talked to him in a while.
[01:52:52.371 --> 01:52:54.273]  But, again...
[01:52:55.828 --> 01:52:59.049]  How did he put that out three years ago where it's now telepathic?
[01:52:59.389 --> 01:53:07.250]  Oh yeah, anyway, so in the respect of blowing up, losing your temper, having a hissy fit, you're like 0.1 Bannon's, so you have nothing to worry about.
[01:53:07.711 --> 01:53:09.971]  Ooh, it's like Bannon's!
[01:53:09.991 --> 01:53:17.953]  0.1 Bannon's, yeah, Bannon's is the scale, is the metric of hysterical temper tantrums.
[01:53:19.684 --> 01:53:20.425]  You're nothing compared to that.
[01:53:20.745 --> 01:53:27.990]  As the lawsuit stuff, it's just designed to, all of your time is used up here, so that none of your time can be used up, you know, building new shows, building new products.
[01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.911]  Which we're trying to do.
[01:53:29.191 --> 01:53:30.532]  Of course, as you're always trying to do.
[01:53:30.552 --> 01:53:32.474]  This stuff is not an accident, it's a strategy.
[01:53:32.554 --> 01:53:36.457]  It is designed to consume your time, and most of all, to consume your emotional energy.
[01:53:36.477 --> 01:53:40.600]  Because each of us, even, you know, those of us who are... So the left are psychic vampires.
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:41.221]  Let me ask you this.
[01:53:41.941 --> 01:53:44.003]  Why do they ruin everything they run?
[01:53:44.424 --> 01:53:47.467]  Why is everything about bullying when they're the biggest bullies?
[01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:50.189]  Why are they such horrible people?
[01:53:50.269 --> 01:53:51.210]  I mean it just never ends.
[01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:58.778]  Well look, I mean, my view on this is that in many cases these social justice warriors become
[01:54:00.199 --> 01:54:03.762]  They become arbiters of other people's behavior because they're unhappy with their own.
[01:54:03.782 --> 01:54:08.146]  They become arbiters of other people's psychology because they have something defective about their own.
[01:54:08.426 --> 01:54:11.589]  These people want to make everybody else miserable because they themselves are suffering.
[01:54:11.829 --> 01:54:16.013]  And you can see that when I went into that bar in New York and I just went for a brunch.
[01:54:16.173 --> 01:54:19.055]  I went for Chadwick Moore, who's on Tucker Carlson all the time, another gay guy.
[01:54:19.336 --> 01:54:24.260]  Got fired, by the way, from the gay magazine he worked for for writing a profile of me which was insufficiently venomous.
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:28.021]  You haven't been mean enough about Marlionopolis, so you're fired.
[01:54:29.161 --> 01:54:30.062]  Works with me now.
[01:54:30.802 --> 01:54:31.902]  We just went in there for brunch.
[01:54:32.142 --> 01:54:32.782]  Can you believe this?
[01:54:32.822 --> 01:54:38.304]  How far the left has moved from its previous mission of looking after minorities, now they're getting between gay men and brunch.
[01:54:38.864 --> 01:54:46.927]  We just went in there, wanted to have lunch, and 30 of these like harpies, these screaming mental, one of them was like a meat mountain, I think she was a woman.
[01:54:49.467 --> 01:54:51.128]  This huge thing is charging at me.
[01:54:51.348 --> 01:54:55.550]  It was like being run at by a hill or something.
[01:54:55.610 --> 01:55:04.394]  I guess I could see my life flash before my eyes as this pink and purple pierced monstrosity just... Are you sure it wasn't grimace from McDonald's?
[01:55:04.434 --> 01:55:07.936]  It was like a full solar eclipse for a second, you know, just looming over.
[01:55:07.956 --> 01:55:09.157]  I was like, oh, that's it, that's it.
[01:55:09.237 --> 01:55:12.238]  And I notice you're like trying to pay the tab they won't let you.
[01:55:12.498 --> 01:55:13.158]  Nazi!
[01:55:13.198 --> 01:55:13.558]  Nazi!
[01:55:13.598 --> 01:55:14.618]  Nazi scum!
[01:55:14.718 --> 01:55:15.759]  I've had a good innings.
[01:55:15.799 --> 01:55:16.359]  I've had a good life.
[01:55:16.379 --> 01:55:16.999]  I've had a nice time.
[01:55:17.019 --> 01:55:17.779]  I've got a good car.
[01:55:17.799 --> 01:55:20.340]  Since you bring it up, let's go ahead and roll that tape from a few weeks ago.
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:20.760]  Here they are.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:23.540]  Nazi scum, get out!
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.621]  Nazi scum, get out!
[01:55:26.341 --> 01:55:27.761]  Nazi scum, get out!
[01:55:28.461 --> 01:55:30.922]  Nazi scum, get out!
[01:55:30.962 --> 01:55:32.362]  Nazi scum, get out!
[01:55:32.382 --> 01:55:33.562]  Nazi scum, get out!
[01:55:33.622 --> 01:55:35.162]  Nazi scum, get out!
[01:55:35.182 --> 01:55:37.003]  There's some reason to pause the video.
[01:55:37.023 --> 01:55:37.583]  Let's reload it.
[01:55:38.843 --> 01:55:41.105]  The fun part about collaborating on TV.
[01:55:41.225 --> 01:55:41.986]  Let's reload the clip.
[01:55:42.006 --> 01:55:42.727]  Do we have the clip back?
[01:55:42.807 --> 01:55:52.976]  What you could hear there, though, which is the important bit, is this sort of cultic, repetitious... And they're always fighting World War II with a Jewish gay guy.
[01:55:53.457 --> 01:55:53.737]  Oh yeah.
[01:55:53.897 --> 01:55:55.398]  Everyone is a Nazi, except them.
[01:55:56.459 --> 01:56:00.343]  The Nazis were the ones that actually chanted and kicked Jews out of bars.
[01:56:00.583 --> 01:56:01.544]  Right, right, right.
[01:56:01.864 --> 01:56:11.074]  The irony is lost on them because they have this new weird definition of white supremacy, anti-semitism and white nationalism which seems to boil down to do you like Trump or not?
[01:56:11.174 --> 01:56:12.135]  Let's try that clip again.
[01:56:12.155 --> 01:56:13.676]  Let's see if the second time's the charm.
[01:56:13.696 --> 01:56:13.997]  Here it is.
[01:56:15.128 --> 01:56:15.688]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:15.708 --> 01:56:16.329]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:16.489 --> 01:56:17.409]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:17.449 --> 01:56:18.029]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:18.049 --> 01:56:18.870]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:19.310]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:19.330 --> 01:56:19.710]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:19.730 --> 01:56:20.150]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:20.170 --> 01:56:21.191]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:21.251 --> 01:56:21.711]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:21.731 --> 01:56:22.291]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:22.311 --> 01:56:23.332]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:23.372 --> 01:56:23.812]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:23.832 --> 01:56:24.312]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:24.332 --> 01:56:24.753]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:24.773 --> 01:56:25.273]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:25.293 --> 01:56:25.673]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:25.693 --> 01:56:26.193]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:26.213 --> 01:56:26.774]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:26.794 --> 01:56:27.394]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:27.414 --> 01:56:27.814]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:27.834 --> 01:56:28.234]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:28.254 --> 01:56:28.614]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:28.634 --> 01:56:29.075]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:29.095 --> 01:56:29.575]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:29.595 --> 01:56:29.955]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:29.975 --> 01:56:30.335]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:30.355 --> 01:56:30.715]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:30.735 --> 01:56:31.396]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:31.576 --> 01:56:32.076]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:32.096 --> 01:56:32.456]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:32.476 --> 01:56:32.856]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:32.877 --> 01:56:33.677]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:33.697 --> 01:56:34.177]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:34.197 --> 01:56:34.697]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:34.717 --> 01:56:35.238]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:35.258 --> 01:56:35.718]  Nazis scum get out!
[01:56:35.738 --> 01:56:35.998]  Nazis sc
[01:56:36.098 --> 01:56:39.359]  You know, I knew that they would go on for hours.
[01:56:39.439 --> 01:56:41.520]  They would have gone on for hours if I just stood there.
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:44.441]  And I thought, you know, I'll just be dignified and gracious.
[01:56:44.461 --> 01:56:47.622]  I didn't have security with me, which is my own stupid fault, because I should know better than that.
[01:56:48.202 --> 01:56:49.502]  But I didn't want it to turn nasty.
[01:56:49.522 --> 01:56:52.743]  The video they didn't post on the internet was when they sort of made a wall.
[01:56:53.264 --> 01:56:54.484]  Some walls are good for some things apparently.
[01:56:54.504 --> 01:56:55.164]  Well, that's what leftists do.
[01:56:55.184 --> 01:56:55.945]  They bump into you.
[01:56:56.045 --> 01:56:56.365]  Right.
[01:56:56.405 --> 01:56:58.165]  They just bumped, you know, just bumped, wasn't it?
[01:56:58.305 --> 01:56:59.246]  But of course they didn't post it.
[01:56:59.286 --> 01:57:00.246]  Anyway, I just...
[01:57:01.641 --> 01:57:03.744]  There's a serious point here, which is not me.
[01:57:03.904 --> 01:57:04.364]  I don't care.
[01:57:04.404 --> 01:57:04.965]  I'm a big guy.
[01:57:05.265 --> 01:57:06.246]  I can look after myself.
[01:57:06.327 --> 01:57:10.531]  I have resources and platforms and fortitude and all the rest of it.
[01:57:10.932 --> 01:57:17.500]  My worry is when people see stuff like that happening in real life or on the news, what happens to the ordinary Republicans and Libertarians at home?
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.123]  Oh, it's meant to intimidate everybody and send a message.
[01:57:21.314 --> 01:57:23.234]  Let me ask you this question, we'll come back in two minutes.
[01:57:23.475 --> 01:57:24.495]  How did it start though?
[01:57:24.515 --> 01:57:26.575]  Like the one person spotted you and then ran over?
[01:57:26.595 --> 01:57:28.036]  Yeah, I just heard my name.
[01:57:28.076 --> 01:57:29.156]  Like one flying monkey?
[01:57:29.176 --> 01:57:29.716]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:29.736 --> 01:57:31.336]  I heard my name from somewhere else in the bar.
[01:57:31.596 --> 01:57:34.237]  And then I heard this woman say, let's do an action.
[01:57:34.797 --> 01:57:35.637]  Let's do an action!
[01:57:36.018 --> 01:57:37.618]  And then it all sort of spiraled out from there.
[01:57:37.638 --> 01:57:40.099]  We went out for a cigarette and they all started booing.
[01:57:40.439 --> 01:57:42.139]  You know, they started yelling and screaming and booing.
[01:57:42.379 --> 01:57:44.520]  Then we tried to come back in, they would not allow us back to our table.
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:48.220]  That's how you fight Nazis, is you kick Jews out of restaurants.
[01:57:48.941 --> 01:57:50.201]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:57:55.888 --> 01:57:57.749]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[01:57:57.769 --> 01:57:58.029]  Go ahead.
[01:57:58.169 --> 01:58:02.011]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[01:58:02.171 --> 01:58:07.193]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[01:58:07.753 --> 01:58:13.296]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your full...
[01:58:14.136 --> 01:58:22.422]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[01:58:23.082 --> 01:58:25.965]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[01:58:26.645 --> 01:58:30.268]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[01:58:30.368 --> 01:58:37.153]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[01:58:37.853 --> 01:58:45.676]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats, how they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[01:58:45.696 --> 01:58:50.658]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[01:58:51.158 --> 01:59:01.322]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water, my mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[01:59:02.196 --> 01:59:03.496]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[01:59:03.697 --> 01:59:08.999]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[01:59:09.019 --> 01:59:10.339]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[01:59:10.379 --> 01:59:10.539]  Yeah.
[01:59:10.699 --> 01:59:12.580]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:13.440]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:15.161]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:16.161]  We really appreciate you.
[01:59:16.541 --> 01:59:17.222]  Keep up the fight.
[01:59:17.242 --> 01:59:18.662]  We need to take California back.
[01:59:18.682 --> 01:59:19.062]  Thank you, Desiree.
[01:59:19.082 --> 01:59:20.163]  We're going to go back and make more calls.
[01:59:20.203 --> 01:59:20.803]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[01:59:22.822 --> 01:59:29.707]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[01:59:29.967 --> 01:59:39.693]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken, and it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[01:59:39.753 --> 01:59:42.735]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[01:59:42.996 --> 01:59:44.216]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[01:59:44.637 --> 01:59:52.122]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:54.384 --> 02:00:00.369]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.497 --> 02:00:14.723]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.501 --> 02:00:19.403]  We're good to go.
[02:00:36.983 --> 02:00:38.544]  Alright, Milo's here with us.
[02:00:38.724 --> 02:00:39.705]  Couple segments left.
[02:00:39.725 --> 02:00:41.746]  We're gonna go out and have a action today.
[02:00:41.786 --> 02:00:43.748]  I'm not gonna say where, but we're going to take action.
[02:00:43.768 --> 02:00:44.688]  Let's do an action.
[02:00:44.868 --> 02:00:49.391]  We got an order from the Russians, they said.
[02:00:49.551 --> 02:00:53.274]  Have you got one of those little Minitel things that the instructions from Putin come in on?
[02:00:53.494 --> 02:00:57.016]  It goes just like... Probably on congressional hearing letters.
[02:00:57.157 --> 02:00:59.258]  Jones, you once testified on television.
[02:00:59.558 --> 02:01:00.259]  You got orders.
[02:01:00.339 --> 02:01:01.239]  It's called a joke.
[02:01:01.299 --> 02:01:03.461]  Minitel from the Kremlin.
[02:01:07.704 --> 02:01:08.464]  They'll play the segment.
[02:01:08.865 --> 02:01:11.567]  This is how they're going to get Trump.
[02:01:11.847 --> 02:01:17.812]  This is how they're going to get Trump because he speaks, I guess like the two of us, he speaks extemporaneously.
[02:01:18.113 --> 02:01:19.534]  He speaks in metaphor.
[02:01:19.814 --> 02:01:23.838]  He kind of, you know, is exploring ideas as he's talking about them.
[02:01:24.278 --> 02:01:27.361]  And he kind of, you know, he has that very loose manner of speaking.
[02:01:27.782 --> 02:01:34.148]  And these guys, if you want to, if you are determined to deliberately... They're going to claim it's obstruction, even though he jokes.
[02:01:34.188 --> 02:01:34.829]  But here's the good part.
[02:01:35.029 --> 02:01:36.330]  He's his own branch of government.
[02:01:36.631 --> 02:01:41.956]  So this whole tail wag the dog thing that if he lied to Mueller or Mueller says he's indicted, sorry, can't do that.
[02:01:41.996 --> 02:01:42.697]  It's all made up.
[02:01:43.157 --> 02:02:00.736]  Yeah, I mean, if you're somebody who, like me, gives hours of interviews a day, or like you, who is on the show for hours a day, and you speak extemporaneously and in an exploratory fashion, just like the President does, it is easy for somebody determined, with an axe to grind, to deliberately misrepresent you.
[02:02:00.896 --> 02:02:07.541]  Sure, meanwhile, they're the ones that lied to Congress about illegal spying, they're the ones running around, total criminals, in bed with the Russians, but this is a short segment.
[02:02:07.621 --> 02:02:20.711]  You told me something that I didn't know about you being thrown out of that New York pub slash restaurant when they were saying Nazi scum, that they only showed the part where you left, they didn't show... Or that they were media people.
[02:02:20.911 --> 02:02:23.573]  Or that two of the people, and this by the way, I had walked in
[02:02:24.253 --> 02:02:31.059]  Unbeknownst to me, to a local meeting of one of the New York Socialist Club, whatever, to- You'd walked into an SJW power nash.
[02:02:31.119 --> 02:02:33.221]  I did and I didn't know, I swear I didn't know.
[02:02:33.281 --> 02:02:35.564]  How dare you enter our royal area?
[02:02:35.584 --> 02:02:37.225]  It was in George Paros!
[02:02:37.565 --> 02:02:43.090]  Little do they know, a white supremacist flag flew above them and- Prostrate yourselves immediately!
[02:02:43.311 --> 02:02:44.312]  Apologize!
[02:02:44.352 --> 02:02:45.613]  This is how I torture people.
[02:02:46.833 --> 02:02:55.857]  This is the New York Socialist Organization, or whatever they call themselves, in a bar called Churchill's, drinking six dollar craft ale.
[02:02:56.977 --> 02:02:58.578]  They don't even know that it's the St.
[02:02:58.598 --> 02:02:59.218]  George's Cross!
[02:02:59.298 --> 02:03:01.579]  All rich white kids, you know, who work.
[02:03:01.719 --> 02:03:03.320]  And they're so historically ignorant.
[02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:05.101]  Oh, it's even better, it's called Churchill's!
[02:03:06.161 --> 02:03:06.821]  I didn't know that!
[02:03:07.001 --> 02:03:17.747]  These colonial-hating socialists, like lunatics, in a bar called Churchill's drinking six-star-well, of course they were drinking craft ale because they're all lesbians, but I love that, by the way, the lesbians think it's hilarious.
[02:03:17.767 --> 02:03:18.407]  We've talked about that lately.
[02:03:18.427 --> 02:03:20.488]  Oh yeah, can you guys get the Media Matters bull down the list?
[02:03:20.548 --> 02:03:22.189]  By the way, I love lesbians!
[02:03:22.249 --> 02:03:23.049]  I love women!
[02:03:23.330 --> 02:03:25.811]  I'm just asking why they all have horrible mullets!
[02:03:26.351 --> 02:03:27.752]  Especially in movies, where they belong.
[02:03:28.012 --> 02:03:28.312]  Porn.
[02:03:28.972 --> 02:03:30.513]  Let me ask you this.
[02:03:30.713 --> 02:03:33.855]  Why did mullets go out in the early 80s, but lesbians still have them?
[02:03:35.442 --> 02:03:39.363]  They're living in the glorious past of the 80s, where we all should still be.
[02:03:40.023 --> 02:03:41.904]  But no, two things before we go to the end.
[02:03:42.124 --> 02:03:45.625]  Two things about this, well one thing, it's two people.
[02:03:45.985 --> 02:03:53.967]  One of the guys in this socialist group or whatever was a reporter for Gizmodo, which is the company that was formed out of the wreckage of Gawker.
[02:03:54.087 --> 02:03:55.167]  It's the leavings of Gawker.
[02:03:55.487 --> 02:03:56.608]  It is, the droppings, you know.
[02:03:56.628 --> 02:04:00.151]  It's like when a dog gets hit by a truck and their guts splatter on the ground.
[02:04:00.171 --> 02:04:03.133]  Or like a doner kebab that's made out of testicles and lungs, you know.
[02:04:03.153 --> 02:04:04.113]  It's like hot dogs.
[02:04:04.134 --> 02:04:05.414]  Vienna sausages.
[02:04:05.535 --> 02:04:08.056]  All the meat goes to, like, real people in restaurants.
[02:04:08.177 --> 02:04:13.140]  And then just all, you know, all the churned up stuff goes into those food trucks in university towns, you know.
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:14.841]  But one of them was from The Nation.
[02:04:14.881 --> 02:04:19.765]  And the other one was a woman from The Nation, which is... The Nation at Churchill?
[02:04:19.885 --> 02:04:21.546]  At least according to that magazine.
[02:04:21.586 --> 02:04:24.749]  No socialist will be caught in that outrageous aerial!
[02:04:25.369 --> 02:04:28.731]  One of America's most prestigious magazines, at least according to The Nation.
[02:04:28.751 --> 02:04:32.612]  Would you like me to host the rest of the hours of British Servant of the Crown?
[02:04:32.992 --> 02:04:35.493]  I'll do Valley Girl if you do Servant of the Crown.
[02:04:36.434 --> 02:04:41.296]  When we return, I shall do it in a Shakespearean rendition of Churchill.
[02:04:41.756 --> 02:04:43.177]  That sounds really good.
[02:04:43.557 --> 02:04:50.039]  And when we return, then you will do it in the, oh my, cue up that Valley Girl thing that they think we're all afraid of.
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:51.220]  The one where she goes,
[02:04:53.795 --> 02:04:55.258]  Venezuela.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:59.124]  Hey, we gotta keep you on with us though when Omar Navarro comes on too.
[02:04:59.164 --> 02:04:59.585]  Of course.
[02:04:59.946 --> 02:05:00.887]  Milo Yiannopoulos.
[02:05:08.573 --> 02:05:17.337]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[02:05:17.757 --> 02:05:25.141]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:25.441 --> 02:05:27.562]  No longer 5%, but now 10% at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:34.221 --> 02:05:41.466]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:41.946 --> 02:05:51.092]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[02:05:51.372 --> 02:05:56.496]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[02:05:56.756 --> 02:05:59.618]  It also funds the InfoWars, a total 360 win.
[02:06:00.018 --> 02:06:02.600]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:15.655 --> 02:06:19.257]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:19.757 --> 02:06:21.278]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.079 --> 02:06:34.965]  An iron curtain of censorship and control has descended upon the Americas.
[02:06:35.005 --> 02:06:35.745]  You're kidding, were you?
[02:06:35.785 --> 02:06:36.826]  That means I have to do it too.
[02:06:36.846 --> 02:06:40.888]  And I'm going to do this entire hour in a church hilly and...
[02:06:42.783 --> 02:06:43.664]  It's not bad, actually.
[02:06:43.684 --> 02:06:44.244]  It's pretty good.
[02:06:44.624 --> 02:06:48.006]  It's not a bad... I mean, most Americans cannot do British accent.
[02:06:48.366 --> 02:06:50.908]  I hope they bring me my scotch immediately.
[02:06:51.928 --> 02:06:58.952]  Most people in Britain do not speak like that anymore, but that wasn't a bad impression of... I understand you, but get at the man!
[02:06:59.012 --> 02:06:59.952]  Get in there!
[02:07:00.172 --> 02:07:00.833]  The enemy!
[02:07:00.853 --> 02:07:02.554]  The enemy is here!
[02:07:03.855 --> 02:07:05.277]  How dare you!
[02:07:05.297 --> 02:07:07.019]  We shall fight them on Info Wars!
[02:07:07.279 --> 02:07:10.723]  We shall fight them with growing confidence and strength in the air!
[02:07:11.063 --> 02:07:19.732]  And then, even if this island was to fall, our great navy from seas across the globe would return to fight on and victory!
[02:07:20.966 --> 02:07:21.387]  There we go.
[02:07:21.827 --> 02:07:22.127]  Lovely.
[02:07:22.147 --> 02:07:22.728]  All right.
[02:07:22.808 --> 02:07:23.328]  Look, beautiful.
[02:07:23.368 --> 02:07:24.009]  This is how I talk to Watson.
[02:07:24.029 --> 02:07:25.090]  You know a lot better than I do.
[02:07:25.130 --> 02:07:26.351]  When Watson doesn't behave.
[02:07:26.571 --> 02:07:27.932]  Far better, yeah.
[02:07:27.992 --> 02:07:28.752]  Is that the punishment?
[02:07:29.273 --> 02:07:31.094]  He'll call you up and he'll say, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:07:31.114 --> 02:07:36.198]  He'll get in your ear and the reward, his reward is that you, you, your church... Only when he ignores me.
[02:07:36.218 --> 02:07:37.439]  And then I go, how?! !
[02:07:40.251 --> 02:07:40.972]  Yeah, you!
[02:07:41.092 --> 02:07:42.373]  They ignore you sometimes.
[02:07:42.853 --> 02:07:43.074]  Yes.
[02:07:43.234 --> 02:07:45.576]  See, I do the same thing when Owen doesn't return my calls.
[02:07:46.316 --> 02:07:47.497]  When I do eventually.
[02:07:47.537 --> 02:07:50.160]  When Paul ignores me, that's when I finally get him.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:53.062]  I go, now you will pay for what you've done!
[02:07:53.442 --> 02:07:55.184]  Tell me of the Admiralty!
[02:07:55.804 --> 02:07:58.627]  And then I make him talk on Emperor Palpatine to me.
[02:07:59.908 --> 02:08:00.869]  How does Emperor Palpatine talk?
[02:08:02.879 --> 02:08:07.662]  Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy!
[02:08:07.702 --> 02:08:09.923]  Very authoritarian British accent!
[02:08:10.784 --> 02:08:14.026]  We are preparing to launch false flags against their operation.
[02:08:14.786 --> 02:08:22.911]  Then we will release diseases through the southern population before we bring down the hammer and crush their entire operation!
[02:08:23.431 --> 02:08:24.893]  That's going to be quoted in print.
[02:08:25.133 --> 02:08:32.823]  Only our operatives are in control of their high command, steering the all of Europe into total destruction!
[02:08:32.843 --> 02:08:34.985]  You like that?
[02:08:35.245 --> 02:08:35.846]  Yes, yes, dad.
[02:08:41.181 --> 02:08:45.302]  I have a similar system of punishment with the lovely Owen Schreuer from the War Room.
[02:08:45.522 --> 02:08:45.882]  Oh really?
[02:08:46.082 --> 02:08:51.543]  Well when he doesn't return my calls, I'll give him exaggerated cuddles and kisses and hugs in front of the crew backstage.
[02:08:51.583 --> 02:08:53.824]  You know, he'll be like, why didn't you return my calls?
[02:08:53.864 --> 02:08:55.724]  You said we were really good friends!
[02:08:55.744 --> 02:08:58.705]  Now see, if I got in trouble for telepathically grooming, you have to stop it right now.
[02:08:58.905 --> 02:09:01.546]  Well I don't work here, so you can't have me for sexual harassment.
[02:09:01.626 --> 02:09:02.786]  What am I telepathically doing?
[02:09:03.823 --> 02:09:08.227]  You're telling me to move on and we should talk about stories and not harass Owen Schreier.
[02:09:08.267 --> 02:09:09.027]  Yep, there we go.
[02:09:09.067 --> 02:09:09.368]  See?
[02:09:09.588 --> 02:09:09.968]  Brilliant.
[02:09:10.008 --> 02:09:10.549]  Anyone can do it.
[02:09:13.759 --> 02:09:16.660]  You know, I feel suitably chastised.
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:17.440]  No, no!
[02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:19.741]  I don't know what I was beaming there.
[02:09:19.881 --> 02:09:21.701]  Well, you were glamouring me, you know, like vampires.
[02:09:21.981 --> 02:09:24.502]  They can make you believe things that are not true.
[02:09:24.702 --> 02:09:30.364]  Like CNN, you know, they hypnotise you and after a while you just start to believe things that couldn't possibly be true.
[02:09:30.384 --> 02:09:35.305]  But getting serious, there is this girl called Sailor Pizza Girl, what's she called?
[02:09:35.425 --> 02:09:37.386]  Is this this thing, Sailor Pizza Girl?
[02:09:39.386 --> 02:09:40.246]  Sailor Socialist.
[02:09:40.386 --> 02:09:41.467]  Sailor Socialist, yes.
[02:09:41.527 --> 02:09:42.067]  Tell us about her.
[02:09:42.387 --> 02:09:48.910]  Okay, they say, because I came in here like during the Southwest, we had so many videos, hundreds a day, I said, listen, put them on subchannels.
[02:09:49.170 --> 02:09:50.230]  I go, how old are these videos?
[02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:50.870]  Like 30 of them.
[02:09:51.791 --> 02:09:55.232]  And they go, well they've been up about 20 minutes, we just uploaded them.
[02:09:55.252 --> 02:09:58.713]  I said, delete those, re-upload them on subchannels, and then we'll get more views.
[02:09:59.193 --> 02:10:08.497]  I walk out, it becomes this thing on NPR, CNN, Vice, that I am scared of this woman, and then I finally watched it last week, it is hilarious!
[02:10:08.757 --> 02:10:24.203]  No, and this argument rests on the idea that you would post a video yourself on your own channel that embarrasses you somehow, or that you're worried about, and then delete it as though you wouldn't know what you were uploading on your own channel in the first place.
[02:10:24.903 --> 02:10:26.804]  This is the sort of straws they have to clutch at.
[02:10:26.844 --> 02:10:28.685]  But they don't even look at the video!
[02:10:28.925 --> 02:10:29.986]  No, they haven't watched it.
[02:10:30.046 --> 02:10:30.646]  Have you seen it?
[02:10:30.706 --> 02:10:31.807]  No, I've seen clips from it.
[02:10:31.827 --> 02:10:34.108]  It is devastatingly annoying.
[02:10:34.148 --> 02:10:35.149]  I have seen clips from it.
[02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:36.590]  When you talk about a valley girl?
[02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:37.130]  Yeah.
[02:10:37.491 --> 02:10:39.792]  And she's like, I've heard of it.
[02:10:39.812 --> 02:10:40.673]  I've really heard of it.
[02:10:40.693 --> 02:10:44.015]  And she's got her little fancy wannabe Japanese outfit on.
[02:10:44.035 --> 02:10:47.737]  It's called Vocal Fry, you know that?
[02:10:47.837 --> 02:10:48.798]  That's called Vocal Fry.
[02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:50.751]  That's a linguistic term.
[02:10:51.291 --> 02:10:51.511]  Wow.
[02:10:51.851 --> 02:10:54.313]  I guess I have it, but she has it in a weird way.
[02:10:54.713 --> 02:11:05.260]  And then she's wearing a Japanese schoolgirl outfit, and then she's got a latte, and she's got like a $1,000 smartphone, she's at a $3,000 conference, and she's sitting here going, oh, he wants... Well, here, let's roll the tape.
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:06.000]  It's too powerful.
[02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:06.700]  We've got to roll it.
[02:11:07.101 --> 02:11:11.083]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[02:11:11.123 --> 02:11:11.443]  Hi!
[02:11:11.583 --> 02:11:12.604]  Are you a fan of Bernie Sanders?
[02:11:13.365 --> 02:11:14.025]  Yeah, I am.
[02:11:14.305 --> 02:11:15.086]  What do you like about him?
[02:11:16.006 --> 02:11:17.047]  That he's a socialist.
[02:11:17.647 --> 02:11:18.528]  Why is socialism good?
[02:11:19.773 --> 02:11:28.415]  Are you like, uh... We're asking people why they like Bernie Sanders.
[02:11:29.895 --> 02:11:30.895]  For InfoWars?
[02:11:31.895 --> 02:11:32.876]  Yes, we are InfoWars.
[02:11:32.936 --> 02:11:35.036]  I think he has a lot of integrity.
[02:11:35.056 --> 02:11:36.436]  I like his value system.
[02:11:36.456 --> 02:11:37.756]  I like what he stands for.
[02:11:37.817 --> 02:11:38.697]  Exactly what values?
[02:11:40.217 --> 02:11:40.937]  Eating the rich.
[02:11:41.697 --> 02:11:42.257]  Eating the rich.
[02:11:42.317 --> 02:11:45.038]  Well, are you aware that Bernie Sanders lives in three million dollar homes?
[02:11:46.543 --> 02:11:47.863]  Uh, no, I was not aware of that.
[02:11:47.983 --> 02:11:48.204]  Yeah.
[02:11:49.064 --> 02:11:50.604]  And are you aware of- I'm gonna ask you something.
[02:11:51.044 --> 02:11:55.265]  Um, so if they're about eating the rich, why do you think so many of the 1% support socialism?
[02:11:56.746 --> 02:11:57.326]  Is that true?
[02:11:58.246 --> 02:11:58.886]  It's very true.
[02:11:58.926 --> 02:11:59.387]  Like who?
[02:11:59.827 --> 02:12:01.387]  Well, for example, you know Venezuela, right?
[02:12:02.187 --> 02:12:02.647]  Heard of it.
[02:12:02.787 --> 02:12:08.229]  A majority of the country is currently eating rats while their politicians are drinking champagne on a daily basis.
[02:12:15.574 --> 02:12:16.495]  But that's not the 1%.
[02:12:18.115 --> 02:12:19.476]  The 1% of Venezuela.
[02:12:19.776 --> 02:12:21.057]  I'm talking about America.
[02:12:21.257 --> 02:12:24.738]  Well, I'm saying since if Bernie Sanders were president, right?
[02:12:25.198 --> 02:12:28.980]  And he wanted to bring the same ideas for socialism into this country.
[02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:30.281]  Yeah.
[02:12:30.301 --> 02:12:31.601]  Do you think that we would benefit?
[02:12:32.702 --> 02:12:33.362]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:33.562 --> 02:12:35.263]  But I just told you Venezuela is eating rats.
[02:12:37.150 --> 02:12:39.231]  But I just want people to have healthcare, honey.
[02:12:39.311 --> 02:12:42.012]  I don't want, like... Honey, honey.
[02:12:42.093 --> 02:12:42.653]  Oh my god.
[02:12:43.233 --> 02:12:44.594]  Oh my... oh my god.
[02:12:44.814 --> 02:12:49.216]  You have, like, worms in your brain, honestly.
[02:12:49.236 --> 02:12:52.518]  You have, like, worms in your brain.
[02:12:53.038 --> 02:12:53.738]  Is she high?
[02:12:53.878 --> 02:12:55.279]  Has she been smoking dope or something?
[02:12:55.299 --> 02:12:57.080]  You can have healthcare without socialism.
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:12:59.041]  I want people to have free healthcare.
[02:12:59.081 --> 02:13:00.042]  Why free?
[02:13:01.222 --> 02:13:02.163]  Why would the government pay for it?
[02:13:02.203 --> 02:13:04.144]  Because I think everyone has a right to have healthcare.
[02:13:05.538 --> 02:13:07.200]  So here's the deal.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:11.484]  They think this is their champion because they know they've got a bunch of dumb followers.
[02:13:11.764 --> 02:13:16.589]  They have to hold up idiocy like tires that blow out the first day you buy them is the best.
[02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:20.133]  And that is supposedly the video that blows InfoWars out of the water.
[02:13:20.213 --> 02:13:22.635]  Well, if that's the best they've got, I think you're doing okay.
[02:13:22.915 --> 02:13:25.058]  Because this is a woman who doesn't even know what socialism means.
[02:13:25.098 --> 02:13:29.142]  On the one hand, she thinks she supports Bernie Sanders because she wants everyone to have free healthcare.
[02:13:29.582 --> 02:13:36.745]  I mean, maybe that's quote-unquote socialized medicine, but there are plenty of capitalist democracies that have, you know, single-payer whatever.
[02:13:37.086 --> 02:13:40.667]  Now, she's perfectly entitled to the view that, you know, that health care is a right.
[02:13:40.687 --> 02:13:41.548]  I happen to think she's wrong.
[02:13:42.008 --> 02:13:42.688]  I think it's stupid.
[02:13:42.708 --> 02:13:46.050]  I don't think it works very well, and I think Canada and Britain prove that.
[02:13:46.090 --> 02:13:48.011]  She's entitled to that view, but that isn't socialism.
[02:13:48.031 --> 02:13:52.113]  But, you know, they've turned it into, like, a meme.
[02:13:52.153 --> 02:13:53.694]  This is her channel.
[02:13:53.754 --> 02:13:55.835]  I think you guys have worms in your brain.
[02:13:55.855 --> 02:13:58.816]  Like, I don't even... You've got, like, worms in your brain right now.
[02:14:00.794 --> 02:14:02.595]  Why do they hold up the dumbest people?
[02:14:02.615 --> 02:14:05.717]  This is like the epic takedown, you know?
[02:14:06.178 --> 02:14:10.000]  I've been in a few of those epic takedown videos myself, but it's me doing the takedown.
[02:14:10.281 --> 02:14:16.345]  And normally it requires like a sassy put-down, a fact they can't answer, a little bit of a rhetorical flourish.
[02:14:16.565 --> 02:14:20.207]  It requires you to utterly... Yeah, there was no Perry Mason moment, nothing.
[02:14:20.247 --> 02:14:21.849]  This woman was a moron.
[02:14:22.389 --> 02:14:28.293]  Venezuela is eating rats and the royal family, the communist family, now lives in Florida and Switzerland, you dumb...
[02:14:28.493 --> 02:14:31.957]  I really just want healthcare.
[02:14:32.337 --> 02:14:36.481]  I just wanted to be nice.
[02:14:36.521 --> 02:14:42.728]  I got a $3,000 ticket to beer and my boyfriend looks like a mid-level executive that drives a $100,000 Audi.
[02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:49.733]  Harry Potter colored blazer with those Oakley sunglasses and the thinning hair.
[02:14:50.034 --> 02:14:52.555]  This is, I don't know, it could be her dad, could be her boyfriend, could be both.
[02:14:53.096 --> 02:14:55.557]  You know, there's this weird guy hovering around outside.
[02:14:55.817 --> 02:14:56.838]  These people are weird.
[02:14:57.258 --> 02:14:57.979]  Deeply weird.
[02:14:58.299 --> 02:15:01.141]  And they have such outsized influence on the way that Americans are here.
[02:15:01.161 --> 02:15:03.923]  And they want to tell us, oh, it's all gonna be free.
[02:15:04.924 --> 02:15:08.226]  We should show up and say, South by Southwest, we demand everyone be able to go free!
[02:15:08.786 --> 02:15:16.509]  I really believe... Because Louis Black, that's his fake name, that runs it, he thinks, you know, he's a beatnik that makes a hundred million dollars a year.
[02:15:17.349 --> 02:15:19.050]  I think it ought to be free.
[02:15:19.230 --> 02:15:22.411]  I believe that access to South by Southwest is a fundamental human right.
[02:15:22.691 --> 02:15:28.373]  I think we should go outside and campaign for free entry for any... And I think they should pay, have a clinic that pays for sex changes at it.
[02:15:28.874 --> 02:15:29.894]  Any registered Republican.
[02:15:30.034 --> 02:15:32.675]  And I identify as a surgeon and I'll do it with a pair of loppers.
[02:15:34.296 --> 02:15:37.837]  Or those garden secateurs, you know, roll up, roll up.
[02:15:38.337 --> 02:15:38.978]  Hedge clippers.
[02:15:38.998 --> 02:15:42.520]  7-speed electric hedge clippers.
[02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:43.341]  No, but I'm serious.
[02:15:43.521 --> 02:15:47.364]  I identify as a doctor, and I say sex changes are free.
[02:15:48.224 --> 02:15:49.405]  I've watched the South Park video.
[02:15:49.445 --> 02:15:50.066]  I've seen them do it.
[02:15:50.086 --> 02:15:53.628]  South by Southwest is going to fund your clinic, but you'll do the operations for free.
[02:15:54.489 --> 02:15:57.331]  South by Southwest offer free sex changes.
[02:15:57.651 --> 02:15:59.753]  Surgeon Jones, I'll use a weed eater.
[02:15:59.793 --> 02:16:01.334]  This is Canada in Texas today.
[02:16:03.035 --> 02:16:09.678]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[02:16:10.338 --> 02:16:12.139]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[02:16:12.739 --> 02:16:18.602]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[02:16:19.002 --> 02:16:21.643]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[02:16:21.923 --> 02:16:24.945]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[02:16:25.305 --> 02:16:31.229]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[02:16:31.869 --> 02:16:38.393]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[02:16:38.713 --> 02:16:44.616]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[02:16:45.077 --> 02:16:48.659]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[02:16:49.179 --> 02:16:57.384]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[02:16:57.764 --> 02:17:04.008]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:17:05.069 --> 02:17:09.493]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[02:17:10.113 --> 02:17:18.220]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:20.442]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[02:17:20.982 --> 02:17:27.888]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[02:17:27.968 --> 02:17:30.971]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[02:17:31.571 --> 02:17:32.472]  It's not absorbable.
[02:17:32.852 --> 02:17:33.413]  It's toxic.
[02:17:34.093 --> 02:17:46.205]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[02:17:46.345 --> 02:17:48.847]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[02:17:49.588 --> 02:17:57.052]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers.
[02:17:57.072 --> 02:17:57.972]  They used to make drugs.
[02:17:58.152 --> 02:17:59.473]  That's why the FDA is involved.
[02:18:00.113 --> 02:18:02.134]  And that's why the DEA is involved.
[02:18:02.554 --> 02:18:07.257]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[02:18:07.837 --> 02:18:11.399]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[02:18:11.679 --> 02:18:15.561]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[02:18:16.141 --> 02:18:18.883]  So, we have a run of this, a limited run.
[02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:20.043]  We have a good supply right now.
[02:18:20.463 --> 02:18:21.824]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[02:18:22.264 --> 02:18:24.566]  But this may be the clincher.
[02:18:24.606 --> 02:18:27.827]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[02:18:28.248 --> 02:18:31.649]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:34.231]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[02:18:34.571 --> 02:18:35.952]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[02:18:36.292 --> 02:18:43.656]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[02:18:43.976 --> 02:18:44.817]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:18:45.697 --> 02:18:45.977]  Yeah.
[02:19:00.694 --> 02:19:00.934]  Pure iodine.
[02:19:01.314 --> 02:19:02.035]  Pure iodine.
[02:19:02.135 --> 02:19:04.376]  You will end up having all sorts of disorders.
[02:19:04.676 --> 02:19:05.376]  Just like water.
[02:19:05.456 --> 02:19:06.296]  Just like oxygen.
[02:19:06.597 --> 02:19:08.738]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[02:19:09.098 --> 02:19:10.338]  It's available exclusively.
[02:19:10.618 --> 02:19:14.560]  Survival Shield X2 at M4WarsLife.com and M4WarsTore.com.
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:15.901]  And I hope, like a few years ago...
[02:19:17.014 --> 02:19:18.195]  That we can work this out.
[02:19:36.327 --> 02:19:39.109]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[02:19:39.450 --> 02:19:47.776]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[02:19:48.317 --> 02:19:52.660]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[02:19:53.081 --> 02:19:59.646]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:20:06.224 --> 02:20:08.946]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.911 --> 02:20:20.472]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.492 --> 02:20:24.374]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[02:20:24.834 --> 02:20:28.636]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my
[02:20:32.113 --> 02:20:33.314]  Alright, getting serious here.
[02:20:33.334 --> 02:20:34.215]  I have a lot of fun with Milo.
[02:20:34.235 --> 02:20:35.036]  He's a smart guy.
[02:20:35.616 --> 02:20:37.938]  The Argentinian peso death spiral.
[02:20:38.779 --> 02:20:41.021]  Venezuela's election handouts are shrinking.
[02:20:41.081 --> 02:20:41.621]  Bloomberg.
[02:20:43.002 --> 02:20:43.903]  And it goes on from there.
[02:20:43.943 --> 02:20:47.366]  As Venezuela's exodus swells, more migrants face removal.
[02:20:47.406 --> 02:20:55.033]  So after a decade of socialism, inextricably leading to communism, they already ate their dogs and cats three years ago.
[02:20:55.593 --> 02:20:56.794]  Everything is hell on earth.
[02:20:56.854 --> 02:20:59.717]  A thousand plus people, they estimate, starve to death a week.
[02:21:00.816 --> 02:21:13.770]  And the answer is, you've got to let the folks into this country now to immediately vote the same to create the same paradigm and the same chain of events over and over and over again.
[02:21:13.810 --> 02:21:17.815]  The definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, thinking you'll get a different result.
[02:21:18.175 --> 02:21:27.180]  Tough to imagine, isn't it, that Venezuela's socialism has failed, given that it works so beautifully and brilliantly everywhere else in the world, and every other time it's never been tried.
[02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:34.084]  I mean, socialism, communism, they have such a storied history of success across the world.
[02:21:34.244 --> 02:21:41.348]  No matter the continent, no matter the era, socialism and communism have produced nothing but wealth, glory, human flourishing and happiness.
[02:21:41.388 --> 02:21:44.070]  Well, they also always tell you how great Canadian and British healthcare are.
[02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:45.490]  They're horrible!
[02:21:46.451 --> 02:21:47.251]  Well, you used to live over there!
[02:21:47.271 --> 02:21:48.372]  Why do you think I moved?
[02:21:49.352 --> 02:21:56.155]  No, I mean, the British press, if you think of it this way, you're trying to make an argument against, you know, socialised healthcare.
[02:21:56.475 --> 02:22:00.616]  The only data you have to go on as an American is what you can find about the British healthcare system.
[02:22:00.636 --> 02:22:04.078]  Well, the British press is just as bad as the American press.
[02:22:04.158 --> 02:22:10.400]  All they're going to publish is the pro-NHS stuff, except when it is so egregiously bad, like pensioners are dying by the thousands.
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:19.663]  You know, people are dying in hospitals because of the MRSA bug, because everything's so filthy, there's like a layer, an inch thick layer of grime on the floors of all these hospitals, and they sort of can't not report on it.
[02:22:21.124 --> 02:22:29.326]  As somebody who has attempted to use this service, I mean, look, of course there are individually brilliant doctors, there are all kinds of... That fight through the system.
[02:22:29.727 --> 02:22:30.167]  Exactly.
[02:22:30.207 --> 02:22:36.389]  But the bureaucracy, the amount of money... Well, I used to watch Prime Minister's Questions even 20 years ago, and I still see it, and people get up and they go,
[02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:41.723]  This person had skin cancer, 100% operable, but after a two-year wait, died.
[02:22:42.103 --> 02:22:45.125]  And imagine, it's just eating you alive, they could just cut it off, they wouldn't even do that!
[02:22:45.205 --> 02:22:49.428]  No, it's been going on, it's been going on since there's been NHS, and the problem continues to get worse and worse and worse.
[02:22:49.468 --> 02:22:53.910]  And it isn't a problem of like, how it's exactly structured, the problem is the state's doing it.
[02:22:54.130 --> 02:22:56.532]  And when the state does it, it introduces more layers of complexity.
[02:22:56.552 --> 02:22:57.593]  Just like the VA!
[02:22:58.033 --> 02:22:58.693]  Exactly.
[02:22:59.014 --> 02:23:05.478]  But then every time I run into one of these trendies, they go, socialism doesn't work, National Health Service...
[02:23:06.478 --> 02:23:06.939]  But it does.
[02:23:06.959 --> 02:23:13.525]  I mean, if you look at the amount of money that is spent on the NHS and what they actually manage to accomplish, that's not working very well.
[02:23:13.585 --> 02:23:19.250]  Well, Paul Watson, years ago, he had a strep throat for three weeks and was coughing blood up.
[02:23:19.290 --> 02:23:20.431]  And I said, have you gone to the doctor?
[02:23:20.451 --> 02:23:23.253]  He goes, Alex, all they do is give me a pack of some
[02:23:24.875 --> 02:23:26.615]  Alka-Seltzer and, you know, this and that.
[02:23:26.635 --> 02:23:28.196]  It wasn't even antibiotics, it was like Tylenol.
[02:23:28.757 --> 02:23:33.439]  And he had to beg them to get a referral to then go to the more elite doctors.
[02:23:33.799 --> 02:23:34.620]  Explain how that works.
[02:23:35.260 --> 02:23:38.642]  Well, this is what Sarah Palin was talking about when she was talking about death panels.
[02:23:38.662 --> 02:23:44.144]  You know, you introduce this element of doctors kind of deciding who can and who cannot have treatment based on resources available because it's all blah, blah, blah.
[02:23:44.465 --> 02:23:49.207]  This all boils down to a health service that does not have free market financial incentives.
[02:23:49.367 --> 02:23:50.828]  A way where you cannot take the
[02:23:51.328 --> 02:23:55.969]  You know, take your consumer choice and pick what's going to work best for you.
[02:23:56.269 --> 02:23:57.670]  And the American system is not perfect.
[02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:59.710]  I think it's, you know, what Obamacare did in particular.
[02:23:59.730 --> 02:24:02.391]  Well, all the government funding has bloated it, just like education.
[02:24:02.451 --> 02:24:03.391]  It's gotten corrupt.
[02:24:03.451 --> 02:24:08.092]  Since Obamacare, I'm discovering now is I'm doing some corporate shuffling at the moment.
[02:24:08.132 --> 02:24:10.213]  And I'm like, OK, well, I have plenty of money in the bank.
[02:24:10.253 --> 02:24:10.873]  Where do I buy health care?
[02:24:10.893 --> 02:24:12.233]  And they're like, oh, you can't until October.
[02:24:12.253 --> 02:24:13.974]  What do you mean I can't buy health care?
[02:24:14.774 --> 02:24:18.215]  Exactly, like I got married and I wanted to switch my wife over to my insurance.
[02:24:18.576 --> 02:24:23.337]  She had to wait till October, like six months last year, and then run in and do it.
[02:24:23.397 --> 02:24:25.738]  No, and it's like, what do you mean I can't buy health care?
[02:24:25.798 --> 02:24:26.458]  How much do you want?
[02:24:26.578 --> 02:24:28.399]  Like, I'll write whatever check size it takes.
[02:24:28.419 --> 02:24:29.239]  What do you want, $50,000?
[02:24:29.339 --> 02:24:29.599]  You want $100,000?
[02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:30.560]  I need health care.
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:31.260]  It's a basic thing.
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:32.521]  I'll do that before I buy anything else.
[02:24:32.541 --> 02:24:33.941]  I'll move to a small house to have health care.
[02:24:33.961 --> 02:24:34.861]  Like, I need health care.
[02:24:35.502 --> 02:24:36.302]  And then, no, you can't buy it.
[02:24:36.382 --> 02:24:37.162]  It's insane.
[02:24:37.282 --> 02:24:39.263]  But this is, as you say, correctly say, is a result.
[02:24:39.303 --> 02:24:40.103]  What an innovation.
[02:24:40.283 --> 02:24:40.843]  Public health care.
[02:24:40.924 --> 02:24:41.144]  Obamacare.
[02:24:41.164 --> 02:24:41.984]  I can't buy health care.
[02:24:42.244 --> 02:24:44.465]  Healthcare now is for one month out of the year.
[02:24:44.545 --> 02:24:45.666]  Exactly, a public sector.
[02:24:45.746 --> 02:24:49.008]  This is the public sector of the government interfering in what ought to be a private sector.
[02:24:49.048 --> 02:24:51.770]  And that's because the insurance companies don't want the big market open anymore.
[02:24:52.110 --> 02:24:53.151]  They want to kill the market.
[02:24:53.251 --> 02:25:01.696]  No, because these big companies are sort of allowed to run right in some respects, but it is an unholy alliance of big government.
[02:25:01.716 --> 02:25:04.277]  By the way, you wanted to hit this because you saw it on our Twitter at Real Alex Jones.
[02:25:04.297 --> 02:25:05.038]  I hope you'll retweet it.
[02:25:05.458 --> 02:25:06.599]  I'm sorry, you're banned on Twitter.
[02:25:06.619 --> 02:25:07.059]  That's okay.
[02:25:07.459 --> 02:25:08.260]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:09.861]  Look at those headlines.
[02:25:09.881 --> 02:25:12.022]  Those are real headlines from the LA Times.
[02:25:12.142 --> 02:25:12.723]  It's a little raw.
[02:25:12.743 --> 02:25:13.343]  It's a little raw.
[02:25:13.844 --> 02:25:14.565]  I was attacking them.
[02:25:15.045 --> 02:25:15.686]  Yeah, sure.
[02:25:15.846 --> 02:25:16.467]  Well, it still hurt me.
[02:25:16.487 --> 02:25:18.369]  Do I need to bring back Churchill?
[02:25:18.589 --> 02:25:28.641]  Now, I don't have any special authority to talk on this story merely by virtue of being homosexual, but I can tell you that this story is the most shocking thing I've seen all year, and this is in a year of particularly shocking things.
[02:25:28.941 --> 02:25:32.946]  And it is knowingly exposing others to HIV will no longer be a felony in California.
[02:25:33.286 --> 02:25:46.997]  So they're making it less of an offence, less criminal, less of a bad thing to do, to knowingly, now this is not some accidental thing, this is not you having an unprotected sexual encounter with somebody and unknowingly, accidentally passing on the HIV virus.
[02:25:47.218 --> 02:25:48.419]  This is doing it on purpose.
[02:25:49.179 --> 02:25:51.421]  Who even has time to spend on laws like that?
[02:25:51.481 --> 02:25:53.162]  How many people are doing this in California?
[02:25:53.462 --> 02:26:06.130]  Well, apparently enough that Democrat lawmakers in California think that it's worthwhile spending time making sure that people who go out and deliberately infect other people with the HIV virus are no longer committing felonies.
[02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:12.395]  So they're going to get shorter prison sentences, they're going to be in different jails, they're going to have a different... It's just a misdemeanor, it's a ticket.
[02:26:12.455 --> 02:26:17.878]  And I predicted last year that you'd see skyrocketing STDs and I made the joke they'd say it was racism.
[02:26:17.938 --> 02:26:18.959]  They did exactly that!
[02:26:19.359 --> 02:26:21.281]  That, you know, it's funny you should say that.
[02:26:21.361 --> 02:26:26.425]  October 6th, last year, knowingly exposing others to HIV will no longer be a felony in California, says the LA Times.
[02:26:26.805 --> 02:26:32.389]  Fast forward to this year, and the LA Times, May 7th, says STDs in LA County are skyrocketing.
[02:26:32.770 --> 02:26:35.352]  Officials think racism and stigma may be to blame.
[02:26:35.572 --> 02:26:40.616]  This is a perfect example of liberals... They try to get rid of stigma and allow people to spread it.
[02:26:40.836 --> 02:26:47.019]  Well, it's like, this is leftists perpetuating toxic, disgusting, unhealthy behaviors.
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:53.903]  And then when people go and engage in those behaviors, which of course people do when there aren't laws about them and the laws aren't being enforced, like the border.
[02:26:54.023 --> 02:26:55.864]  If you don't enforce the border, people are going to try and cross it.
[02:26:56.344 --> 02:27:03.769]  If we were to suddenly stop enforcing the murder law, there'd be a lot more murders, just as there are when the number of police go down in Chicago and New York.
[02:27:04.229 --> 02:27:07.731]  Yeah, why don't they make it legal to spread hepatitis?
[02:27:08.411 --> 02:27:10.772]  But they virtue-signaled to HIV!
[02:27:10.812 --> 02:27:11.452]  Give them a few weeks.
[02:27:13.432 --> 02:27:27.015]  Now that the numbers of infections are of course going up because it is no longer such a serious thing to do to another person, this by the way is, and it wasn't until recently, until medication got better, effectively awarding them a death sentence.
[02:27:27.055 --> 02:27:29.915]  I'm not sure how morally distinct that is from killing somebody.
[02:27:29.955 --> 02:27:31.296]  And it still kills a lot of people.
[02:27:31.456 --> 02:27:31.816]  Exactly.
[02:27:31.856 --> 02:27:33.256]  You're just doing it more slowly.
[02:27:33.736 --> 02:27:36.977]  And it's going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:27:37.097 --> 02:27:37.497]  Of course.
[02:27:37.557 --> 02:27:39.178]  So you're robbing them of their health.
[02:27:39.198 --> 02:27:43.859]  When Monsanto does it with pesticides and all the rest of it, we're perfectly happy to say that they are killing people slowly.
[02:27:43.879 --> 02:27:48.980]  But if you deliberately infect someone with HIV or you should get less of a sentence, give me a break.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.621]  And I've read about these psychos that poke holes in the condoms and stuff to give it to women.
[02:27:52.941 --> 02:27:55.502]  Because they're making it all a gay thing.
[02:27:55.542 --> 02:27:57.323]  It's a sex deal, period.
[02:27:57.383 --> 02:27:58.543]  Not just the homosexuals.
[02:27:59.043 --> 02:28:02.465]  It is, you know, it is all kinds of freaky wackos.
[02:28:02.926 --> 02:28:09.790]  What is the motivation, what is the psychology behind a Democrat who makes laws in California spending time going to the office trying to get this passed?
[02:28:09.810 --> 02:28:13.872]  Can you imagine me and Jerry Brown, who was proud of it, going, we're getting rid of the stigma of HIV.
[02:28:14.293 --> 02:28:16.354]  Getting rid of the stigma, you crazy person!
[02:28:16.374 --> 02:28:18.655]  That's one thing, but getting rid of the stigma is one thing.
[02:28:18.855 --> 02:28:26.000]  Getting rid of the stigma might be, for instance, like trying to show that it's not a death sentence anymore, saying that most infections are accidental, saying that it, blah blah blah.
[02:28:26.220 --> 02:28:27.561]  Getting rid of the stigma is not
[02:28:28.001 --> 02:28:29.522]  Decriminalizing, effectively.
[02:28:29.843 --> 02:28:30.803]  Deliberately giving it to people.
[02:28:30.823 --> 02:28:36.528]  Yeah, we're saying, this can kill you, and if you deliberately spread other diseases, you go to prison, but this one you're allowed to.
[02:28:36.728 --> 02:28:40.391]  And of course, inevitably, they show... So is it legalizing bug chasing?
[02:28:40.771 --> 02:28:41.592]  Yes, bug chasing.
[02:28:41.692 --> 02:28:44.454]  Well, yes, but it's... Yes.
[02:28:44.954 --> 02:28:50.919]  But the person doing the deliberate infection is now no longer at risk of... That sounds psychotic.
[02:28:50.959 --> 02:28:54.902]  Let's finish up with this and then go to the home state of the mad dog.
[02:28:54.922 --> 02:28:57.404]  She doesn't have HIV, she has rabies.
[02:28:57.944 --> 02:29:00.006]  The Pig Monster Goblin herself!
[02:29:00.767 --> 02:29:02.528]  Maxine Mad Dog Fox.

[02:30:02.785 --> 02:30:08.048]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:30:08.769 --> 02:30:12.091]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:30:12.931 --> 02:30:19.175]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:30:20.976 --> 02:30:27.298]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:33.340]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:30:33.981 --> 02:30:46.105]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[02:30:46.705 --> 02:30:56.471]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[02:31:12.406 --> 02:31:14.208]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[02:31:14.248 --> 02:31:21.374]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[02:31:21.774 --> 02:31:27.560]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[02:31:28.260 --> 02:31:29.581]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[02:31:30.182 --> 02:31:49.239]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:54.462]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[02:31:54.762 --> 02:31:57.223]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult.
[02:31:57.243 --> 02:32:00.044]  A lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[02:32:00.444 --> 02:32:01.484]  As above, so below.
[02:32:02.065 --> 02:32:04.886]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[02:32:05.766 --> 02:32:06.847]  Most tiny of scales.
[02:32:07.387 --> 02:32:08.448]  And that's what this comes down to.
[02:32:08.889 --> 02:32:10.370]  America is building its wall.
[02:32:10.770 --> 02:32:11.251]  Will it work?
[02:32:11.371 --> 02:32:11.911]  We don't know.
[02:32:12.371 --> 02:32:12.952]  Is Trump right?
[02:32:13.653 --> 02:32:15.794]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[02:32:16.275 --> 02:32:22.240]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:28.505]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[02:32:29.245 --> 02:32:35.527]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[02:32:36.287 --> 02:32:40.248]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[02:32:40.649 --> 02:32:51.292]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[02:32:51.952 --> 02:32:54.334]  This is a 360 non-zero-sum game win.
[02:32:54.994 --> 02:32:58.216]  You will get Ami and Wall and other great products at m4slife.com.
[02:32:58.557 --> 02:33:02.279]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[02:33:06.222 --> 02:33:08.883]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:19.406 --> 02:33:20.427]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:20.507 --> 02:33:22.648]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:44.199 --> 02:33:45.100]  My past.
[02:33:46.501 --> 02:33:47.221]  My calling.
[02:33:48.222 --> 02:33:51.384]  My name is Maxine.
[02:33:52.404 --> 02:33:56.867]  I grew up a black woman in a racist, sexist city.
[02:33:57.428 --> 02:34:02.531]  But despite the odds being against me, I made it.
[02:34:03.912 --> 02:34:06.173]  I have a right to my anger.
[02:34:06.814 --> 02:34:09.235]  I call it rebellion.
[02:34:11.589 --> 02:34:12.251]  Yeah.
[02:34:24.758 --> 02:34:40.308]  The disproportionate numbers of black males that are in prisons around this country are in prisons because they don't have the wealth by which to get fancy lawyers who will go in- Actually, Hillary wrote the laws and called them animals, lady.
[02:34:40.428 --> 02:34:42.309]  As white folks can do in America.
[02:34:42.449 --> 02:34:44.050]  This is punishment.
[02:34:44.090 --> 02:34:48.974]  This is being very harsh on the most vulnerable people in our society.
[02:34:48.994 --> 02:34:54.237]  To include liquor stores and this group of stores that you would not like- Listen to this in a minute.
[02:34:54.977 --> 02:34:57.199]  Turn us back on, guys.
[02:34:57.319 --> 02:34:59.081]  She says, I hate it.
[02:34:59.181 --> 02:35:00.302]  They're waving American flags.
[02:35:00.322 --> 02:35:00.782]  They're happy.
[02:35:00.822 --> 02:35:03.024]  Wait a minute.
[02:35:03.664 --> 02:35:05.045]  This is remarkable.
[02:35:05.066 --> 02:35:09.769]  You have women like her and you've got the Congressional Black Caucus sitting there refusing to applaud for Trump.
[02:35:09.969 --> 02:35:10.590]  Listen to this part.
[02:35:10.610 --> 02:35:11.310]  Listen to this part.
[02:35:12.111 --> 02:35:16.435]  By the Tea Party operation in Washington, D.C.
[02:35:16.816 --> 02:35:21.701]  And I think that speaks volumes about what's causing problems in Washington, D.C.
[02:35:21.721 --> 02:35:23.663]  What exactly outlandish behavior?
[02:35:23.683 --> 02:35:25.384]  Specifically, what do you mean by that?
[02:35:25.444 --> 02:35:27.206]  The shouting.
[02:35:27.346 --> 02:35:29.869]  The Republicans were out there having a great time.
[02:35:29.889 --> 02:35:30.690]  They were laughing.
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:41.623]  The only reason I interrupted you is she did this again last week where she said it makes her upset to hear Make America Great Again.
[02:35:41.943 --> 02:35:42.943]  That's enough of her for now.
[02:35:42.963 --> 02:35:43.723]  It's a 10-minute long.
[02:35:43.743 --> 02:35:45.064]  It's called Mad Max Scene.
[02:35:45.084 --> 02:35:45.684]  Derek McBrain did it.
[02:35:45.744 --> 02:35:46.204]  It's excellent.
[02:35:46.244 --> 02:35:46.664]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:35:47.085 --> 02:35:53.127]  Specifically, she was asked what outlandish behavior and her response is people having a good time, laughing.
[02:35:54.764 --> 02:35:54.864]  It's
[02:36:12.940 --> 02:36:20.045]  Roy, the black family, was the crime bill incarcerating every other black dad in the country for these stupid minor drugs.
[02:36:20.065 --> 02:36:24.548]  But it went from like 30% of black males end up having a felony background to like 80% after that.
[02:36:24.648 --> 02:36:25.849]  And she knows full well.
[02:36:26.329 --> 02:36:27.390]  And still it's the Republicans.
[02:36:27.410 --> 02:36:28.090]  By the way, who was it?
[02:36:28.110 --> 02:36:29.991]  Libertarians like me trying to get rid of that.
[02:36:30.011 --> 02:36:33.553]  And it's still, it's the Republicans' fault for being happy and waving flags.
[02:36:34.854 --> 02:36:36.976]  By the way, before we move on, because I know we have an interview.
[02:36:36.996 --> 02:36:37.516]  Finish your point.
[02:36:37.536 --> 02:36:38.076]  We have an interview.
[02:36:38.337 --> 02:36:41.959]  The last thing to say about this crazy HIV California situation.
[02:36:42.359 --> 02:36:43.761]  Well, recap.
[02:36:43.781 --> 02:36:44.542]  Some people just joined us.
[02:36:44.682 --> 02:36:44.942]  Okay.
[02:36:45.162 --> 02:36:52.470]  So, first of all, they decriminalize the deliberate infection of another person with the HIV virus, so they take it away.
[02:36:52.490 --> 02:36:54.032]  It's no longer a felony.
[02:36:54.292 --> 02:36:55.213]  Now it's just a misdemeanor.
[02:36:55.233 --> 02:36:56.434]  It's like getting a parking ticket.
[02:36:56.454 --> 02:36:57.155]  That happened last year.
[02:36:57.816 --> 02:36:59.818]  And this is effectively killing someone slowly.
[02:37:00.058 --> 02:37:01.420]  Now no longer a federal crime.
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:05.724]  Fast forward six months to May of this year and STDs in LA County are skyrocketing.
[02:37:05.844 --> 02:37:13.633]  Officials, who were responsible presumably for bringing in this crazy policy in the first place, now say, oh it's racism and stigma that are responsible.
[02:37:13.833 --> 02:37:18.619]  In other words, we've just created a health crisis and found a way to blame Republicans for it.
[02:37:19.219 --> 02:37:36.524]  And not only that, but if you really want to just see a perfect illustration of the gap between what liberals say that they want and what they actually do, who do you think gets affected the most in these situations where random unprotected sex is encouraged by the law, is permitted by social codes and all the rest of it?
[02:37:36.884 --> 02:37:37.544]  It's minorities.
[02:37:37.604 --> 02:37:43.706]  It is blacks and Hispanics who are experiencing the most dramatic increases in gonorrhea, in all these other total...
[02:37:44.906 --> 02:37:54.634]  Well there, and it's so, it's like, oh we legalize all this, it explodes, and then we... And now it's going up, because Republicans are racists.
[02:37:56.276 --> 02:37:59.318]  I mean it is as stupid as it sounds, it really is as stupid as it sounds.
[02:38:01.536 --> 02:38:03.937]  Governor Brown thought he saw flying saucers 30 years ago.
[02:38:05.098 --> 02:38:06.279]  What is up with the left?
[02:38:06.299 --> 02:38:08.240]  Because they really are... It was Maxine.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:10.121]  It's like a party of crazy people.
[02:38:10.141 --> 02:38:11.542]  Let me ask... He did see flying saucers.
[02:38:11.582 --> 02:38:13.603]  It was Maxine Waters arriving on this planet.
[02:38:14.243 --> 02:38:16.044]  She came from her native galaxy.
[02:38:17.325 --> 02:38:18.406]  James Brown is a planet.
[02:38:18.426 --> 02:38:19.467]  Everybody looks like James Brown.
[02:38:20.388 --> 02:38:20.968]  James Brown.
[02:38:21.049 --> 02:38:22.970]  Remember they called... Was it Donald Trump Jr.
[02:38:23.010 --> 02:38:24.472]  or something they called racist for saying?
[02:38:24.532 --> 02:38:28.455]  Or was it... No, it was Bill O'Reilly saying she looks like James Brown.
[02:38:28.495 --> 02:38:29.356]  She does, man!
[02:38:29.396 --> 02:38:31.558]  We can make fun of her if we want.
[02:38:32.259 --> 02:38:33.500]  Oh, dear.
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.743]  I love the fact it's all over the newspapers and I'm calling her a mad dog.
[02:38:37.223 --> 02:38:37.783]  Get on up.
[02:38:38.524 --> 02:38:39.065]  Oh, here we go.
[02:38:39.765 --> 02:38:40.306]  Absolutely.
[02:38:40.526 --> 02:38:44.310]  Can we come back in the next segment from Rocky 3 or whatever, Living in America?
[02:38:44.470 --> 02:38:45.271]  Yes, yes, I think we can.
[02:38:45.291 --> 02:38:46.872]  Just come in with like the finale.
[02:38:46.912 --> 02:38:52.317]  Just to upset Maxine, because she seems to be very... Well, you know, she loses a double life as a Hollywood star.
[02:38:53.298 --> 02:38:54.099]  And as James Brown.
[02:38:54.119 --> 02:38:55.821]  Who knew that James Brown was transsexual?
[02:38:56.481 --> 02:38:58.483]  And a member of Congress.
[02:38:58.843 --> 02:39:00.024]  They say I'm Bill Gates.
[02:39:00.524 --> 02:39:00.764]  Do they?
[02:39:00.865 --> 02:39:01.645]  I mean Bill Hicks.
[02:39:01.825 --> 02:39:02.205]  Bill Hicks.
[02:39:02.266 --> 02:39:03.206]  I am actually Bill Gates.
[02:39:03.546 --> 02:39:07.910]  But anyways, I identify as Bill Gates.
[02:39:07.950 --> 02:39:09.010]  That means I get his fortune.
[02:39:09.050 --> 02:39:10.652]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:39:10.692 --> 02:39:11.973]  You should remove him.
[02:39:11.993 --> 02:39:13.594]  I identify as a medical doctor.
[02:39:14.054 --> 02:39:15.495]  I'm going to start giving free sex changes.
[02:39:16.015 --> 02:39:17.817]  And South by Southwest is paying for it.
[02:39:18.297 --> 02:39:20.037]  Seriously, a great guest we get in all the time.
[02:39:20.137 --> 02:39:21.378]  Love having him on.
[02:39:21.398 --> 02:39:24.398]  Omar Navarro, omarnavarro.com, an amazing patriot.
[02:39:24.418 --> 02:39:30.580]  I won't go over his whole background, but he goes out with mariachi bands in front of her multi-million dollar homes, where she doesn't even live.
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:32.100]  It's pure gold.
[02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:37.762]  And he joins us, omarnavarro, omarnavarro.com, on Twitter, at realomarnavarro.
[02:39:38.282 --> 02:39:39.702]  Omar, we salute you, my friend.
[02:39:40.102 --> 02:39:45.383]  We wanted to get you on about her latest exploits and how the race is going against James Brown.
[02:39:48.399 --> 02:39:51.021]  Well, one of the things, so we're talking about crime.
[02:39:51.562 --> 02:39:58.007]  No one talks about that the LA Times named one part in her district one of the most horrible places to be in, actually.
[02:39:58.027 --> 02:40:02.010]  You have a 55% chance of a crime being committed against you in Westmont.
[02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:04.151]  They named it Death Alley.
[02:40:04.191 --> 02:40:05.252]  That tells you everything.
[02:40:05.693 --> 02:40:07.874]  Maxine Waters is not concerned about the people here.
[02:40:07.914 --> 02:40:09.175]  She's concerned about her pockets.
[02:40:09.576 --> 02:40:11.597]  She's not concerned about her constituents.
[02:40:11.898 --> 02:40:14.920]  She's concerned about serving herself and her family.
[02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:19.263]  You know, we need people who are going to do something, who are going to take care of the people here in the district.
[02:40:19.283 --> 02:40:23.106]  When I go door-to-door and I talk to people, people are just fed up and tired of Maxine Waters.
[02:40:23.446 --> 02:40:25.408]  Maxine Waters says that she has millennial support.
[02:40:25.648 --> 02:40:27.229]  She has no millennials supporting her here.
[02:40:27.970 --> 02:40:29.171]  She's running against a millennial.
[02:40:29.511 --> 02:40:30.792]  So, I mean, that tells you a lot.
[02:40:31.793 --> 02:40:40.600]  Well, I know that despite the fact she has hundreds of millions of dollars and is a known swindler, one of the most corrupt people in Congress on record, you are within striking distance.
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:42.021]  How do we help you get elected?
[02:40:43.052 --> 02:40:44.452]  Yeah, I mean, anybody can help.
[02:40:44.632 --> 02:40:45.913]  They can go to my campaign office.
[02:40:45.933 --> 02:40:46.913]  They can make phone calls.
[02:40:46.933 --> 02:40:48.093]  They can walk door-to-door.
[02:40:48.533 --> 02:40:51.093]  They can donate to the campaign at omarnavarro.com.
[02:40:51.114 --> 02:40:51.914]  That helps out a lot.
[02:40:52.394 --> 02:40:53.814]  They can be from any state.
[02:40:53.934 --> 02:40:57.495]  Anybody here who's just fed up with Maxine Waters, who wants her out of there.
[02:40:58.015 --> 02:40:59.375]  I mean, this person's unhinged.
[02:40:59.395 --> 02:41:03.656]  She's constantly trying to impeach the President of the United States with no basis at all.
[02:41:04.876 --> 02:41:05.336]  Now wait!
[02:41:05.676 --> 02:41:07.877]  She said she's offended by Make America Great Again.
[02:41:07.917 --> 02:41:08.597]  That's her basis.
[02:41:08.617 --> 02:41:09.617]  She's given us a basis.
[02:41:10.257 --> 02:41:11.278]  Which is totally insane.
[02:41:11.318 --> 02:41:14.241]  As much as I want to get you in Congress, man, she's entertaining.
[02:41:14.501 --> 02:41:20.406]  No, I mean, Omar, you seem like a perfectly nice guy, but I'm not sure that we can do this to America.
[02:41:20.426 --> 02:41:22.147]  I'm not sure we can remove her from the world stage.
[02:41:22.468 --> 02:41:24.169]  I think I'm going to have to go out and campaign for her.
[02:41:24.189 --> 02:41:24.870]  I'm so sorry.
[02:41:24.890 --> 02:41:27.612]  Well, look at this.
[02:41:27.812 --> 02:41:30.655]  At the end of the day, we have to get her out of there.
[02:41:30.715 --> 02:41:31.876]  She is nuts.
[02:41:31.916 --> 02:41:33.837]  That's the right thing to do.
[02:41:34.938 --> 02:41:36.540]  Omar, am I right that she's getting crazier?
[02:41:37.837 --> 02:41:39.900]  She's gotten crazier as time goes by.
[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:48.132]  I mean, every time I see her, she's always constantly saying something outrageous on TV, and I think she does it because she thinks that she's going to get re-elected by being crazy.
[02:41:48.613 --> 02:41:52.839]  And at the end of the day, the people here in this district are seeing what she's saying, and they think it's absurd.
[02:41:54.180 --> 02:41:56.403]  And they don't want someone like that representing them here.
[02:41:57.064 --> 02:42:01.749]  The majority of the district here in the demographics of the district, or 54% of them, are Hispanic Latinos.
[02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:04.593]  A lot of the Hispanic Latinos don't like Maxine Waters.
[02:42:04.673 --> 02:42:06.495]  They think Maxine Waters is out of it.
[02:42:06.795 --> 02:42:08.638]  They think that she is not representing them.
[02:42:08.798 --> 02:42:11.221]  They think that she is representing her own interests.
[02:42:11.261 --> 02:42:12.943]  She's living in a mansion in Hancock Park.
[02:42:13.723 --> 02:42:18.085]  She's not living in the district where I announced my campaign with a mariachi band.
[02:42:18.486 --> 02:42:24.268]  I mean, so I think we should pay a visit back to Maxine Waters' house with a mariachi band, but this time bring a taco truck in front of it.
[02:42:24.409 --> 02:42:26.910]  Maybe we should do it on June 2nd or something like that.
[02:42:28.310 --> 02:42:31.312]  I totally agree, and I want to cover it live, Omar, when we come back.
[02:42:31.492 --> 02:42:33.013]  Let's talk about the exodus.
[02:42:34.241 --> 02:42:46.270]  Out of your amazing state, California, because of the high taxes, the regulation, the hepatitis all over the streets, the piles of human feces everywhere, it's true.
[02:42:46.931 --> 02:42:51.154]  We've sent reporters, it's like Mexico City's worst areas look better than L.A.
[02:42:51.674 --> 02:42:58.840]  Open sewage running down the street and like weirdo Democrats, always like demons, squatting over the fetid open sewers.
[02:42:59.420 --> 02:43:00.941]  We'll be right back with Omar Navarro.
[02:43:00.961 --> 02:43:01.402]  Stay with us.
[02:43:02.358 --> 02:43:04.319]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:04.339 --> 02:43:04.759]  Go ahead.
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:07.221]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:07.241 --> 02:43:10.283]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:11.123 --> 02:43:12.224]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:12.544 --> 02:43:14.265]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:14.985 --> 02:43:17.047]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:17.287 --> 02:43:21.309]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:21.329 --> 02:43:23.791]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:24.611 --> 02:43:26.913]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:26.933 --> 02:43:28.413]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:28.654 --> 02:43:29.534]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:29.774 --> 02:43:30.815]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:31.235 --> 02:43:32.275]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:32.335 --> 02:43:33.416]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:43:33.676 --> 02:43:34.236]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:34.516 --> 02:43:39.877]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:44.458]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:44.698 --> 02:43:47.559]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:47.819 --> 02:43:48.199]  You understand?
[02:43:48.299 --> 02:43:49.559]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:49.940 --> 02:43:51.060]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:56.966]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:43:57.667 --> 02:43:58.368]  Do you understand?
[02:43:58.388 --> 02:43:59.609]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:44:00.030 --> 02:44:01.492]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:44:13.376 --> 02:44:22.438]  We are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president and the people who voted for him and the free system that allowed it to happen in American history.
[02:44:22.939 --> 02:44:31.821]  From the highest levels of government to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us.
[02:44:32.381 --> 02:44:37.285]  But the ultimate insult is that they think we're so stupid that we'll let them get away with it.
[02:44:37.785 --> 02:44:54.136]  These saboteurs, slashing away with their leaks and sneers, their phony accusations and gagging sanctimony, drive their daggers through the heart of our future, poisoning our belief that honest custody of our institutions will ever again be possible.
[02:44:54.737 --> 02:44:58.760]  So they can then build their utopia from the ashes of what they burned down.
[02:44:59.460 --> 02:44:59.680]  No.
[02:45:00.221 --> 02:45:05.849]  Their fate will be failure, and they will perish in the political flames of their own fires.
[02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:12.878]  We are the National Rifle Association of America, and we are freedom's safest place.
[02:45:12.938 --> 02:45:15.622]  You know, I just heard that National Rifle Association ad.
[02:45:16.803 --> 02:45:20.624]  Airing on the radio side, TV side.
[02:45:20.664 --> 02:45:23.645]  We had a video ad going with Dana Lash.
[02:45:23.665 --> 02:45:24.845]  I always call her Losh.
[02:45:25.646 --> 02:45:26.606]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[02:45:26.626 --> 02:45:27.346]  Dana Lash.
[02:45:27.686 --> 02:45:29.307]  Great, smart, syndicated radio host.
[02:45:30.207 --> 02:45:30.667]  Great lady.
[02:45:31.207 --> 02:45:37.709]  Very successful spokesperson for the NRA that the left wants to basically kill and says is a witch and burn her, literally.
[02:45:39.329 --> 02:45:43.310]  They heard that ad running and Media Matters wrote stories about it.
[02:45:44.031 --> 02:45:45.151]  George Soros' outfit.
[02:45:46.266 --> 02:45:50.687]  Saying, oh, look, the National Rifle Association is spending money with Alex Jones.
[02:45:50.768 --> 02:45:56.389]  Like, they're the arbiter, they're the boss, they're the god, and ooh, if they say it's bad, it's bad.
[02:45:57.010 --> 02:45:58.010]  No, morons.
[02:45:58.770 --> 02:45:59.790]  I like that ad.
[02:46:00.831 --> 02:46:04.852]  So, I have part of the radio ads on the network, so I run that ad.
[02:46:05.192 --> 02:46:07.493]  Even though one of those ads is about $1,000 a minute, I run it.
[02:46:07.553 --> 02:46:08.753]  And eat $1,000 every time.
[02:46:09.594 --> 02:46:10.454]  Comprende?
[02:46:14.582 --> 02:46:16.383]  I pay to air the NRA.
[02:46:17.484 --> 02:46:18.084]  Figure that out?
[02:46:18.944 --> 02:46:20.405]  So you guys don't get it, do you?
[02:46:21.146 --> 02:46:22.486]  I'm not doing this for money.
[02:46:23.167 --> 02:46:24.688]  I'm not doing this for myself.
[02:46:25.368 --> 02:46:28.690]  I don't sit there and calculate the work I do about me personally.
[02:46:29.050 --> 02:46:31.011]  It's about my children and the future.
[02:46:31.692 --> 02:46:32.612]  I'm a kamikaze.
[02:46:33.573 --> 02:46:35.454]  I don't care what you do to me financially.
[02:46:35.734 --> 02:46:37.075]  I don't care how you come after me.
[02:46:37.255 --> 02:46:38.155]  I'm committed.
[02:46:38.696 --> 02:46:42.538]  Because I know you're bad people and I want to get you off of our collective backs.
[02:46:45.362 --> 02:46:48.706]  Isn't that something you can now understand, dumbos?
[02:46:52.289 --> 02:46:57.795]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:05.763 --> 02:47:08.406]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:29.365 --> 02:47:31.667]  I love how Maxi's battling those Russians.
[02:47:32.548 --> 02:47:37.872]  Here's the total proof right here.
[02:47:37.912 --> 02:47:38.333]  Woo!
[02:47:38.353 --> 02:47:42.757]  I feel good!
[02:47:42.837 --> 02:47:43.638]  Beat those Russians.
[02:47:47.721 --> 02:47:48.102]  And now...
[02:47:57.725 --> 02:47:59.706]  Okay, now that's enough of Maxine.
[02:47:59.726 --> 02:48:02.268]  Back when she was younger, great artist, very talented.
[02:48:02.728 --> 02:48:06.371]  I want to, before we go back to Omar Navarro, because Roger Stone never calls with huge breaking news.
[02:48:06.391 --> 02:48:07.312]  He's freaking out right now.
[02:48:07.572 --> 02:48:10.314]  We're going to commandeer 15 minutes of the time of Gerald Celente.
[02:48:11.134 --> 02:48:11.995]  Freaking out.
[02:48:12.435 --> 02:48:12.995]  Absolutely.
[02:48:13.015 --> 02:48:14.496]  Roger Stone is freaking out right now.
[02:48:14.537 --> 02:48:18.319]  Omar Navarro running against the talented musician you just saw.
[02:48:18.339 --> 02:48:19.440]  Obviously you can't vote for him.
[02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:19.860]  Beautiful.
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:22.262]  But here's another word from Maxine Waters.
[02:48:23.121 --> 02:48:29.084]  I want you to know that I am more offended as an African-American woman than you will ever be.
[02:48:29.524 --> 02:48:35.147]  And this business about making America great again, it is your president that's dividing this country.
[02:48:35.447 --> 02:48:41.630]  And don't talk to me about the fact that we don't understand what happens on the... No, I will not yield.
[02:48:41.950 --> 02:48:42.850]  No, I will not yield.
[02:48:43.091 --> 02:48:43.351]  Okay.
[02:48:43.691 --> 02:48:45.592]  Don't tell me that we don't understand.
[02:48:45.652 --> 02:48:50.494]  That's the attitude that's been given toward women time and time again.
[02:48:50.514 --> 02:48:51.895]  The gentlelady will suspend.
[02:48:52.816 --> 02:48:54.640]  I like the blue nail polish.
[02:48:54.660 --> 02:48:58.750]  Oh, she's sassy, she's fashionable, she's fabulous.
[02:48:58.790 --> 02:49:00.574]  The problem is she's completely mental.
[02:49:00.614 --> 02:49:01.396]  Well, did you hear?
[02:49:02.708 --> 02:49:05.290]  She says, I take offense at Make America Great Again.
[02:49:05.310 --> 02:49:06.811]  And I went back and watched the guy's speech.
[02:49:06.831 --> 02:49:13.255]  It's like whites and blacks and Hispanics working together in an American dream on the floor of the Ford dealership.
[02:49:13.295 --> 02:49:14.276]  There's not racism.
[02:49:14.296 --> 02:49:15.017]  We're a team.
[02:49:15.057 --> 02:49:17.578]  That's the Democrat nightmare.
[02:49:17.698 --> 02:49:20.540]  One thing they don't want is everybody working in happy harmony.
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:25.003]  Let's go back to Omar Nawar running for Congress against Maxine Waters.
[02:49:25.284 --> 02:49:25.664]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:49:26.886 --> 02:49:27.146]  I think so.
[02:49:51.090 --> 02:49:51.770]  In 30 years.
[02:49:52.311 --> 02:50:00.015]  Omar, let me ask you, because I'm a student of the hierarchy of privilege, you know, of the oppression league tables.
[02:50:00.396 --> 02:50:01.636]  Now you, of course, Hispanic.
[02:50:02.077 --> 02:50:04.118]  Maxine Waters, James, is black.
[02:50:04.158 --> 02:50:09.381]  Have you been accused of being a racist for running against a black woman in your district?
[02:50:09.461 --> 02:50:11.742]  And do you just respond in Spanish?
[02:50:11.802 --> 02:50:12.823]  James Brown is not a woman.
[02:50:13.443 --> 02:50:15.186]  Uh, Milo, that's great actually.
[02:50:15.206 --> 02:50:16.688]  I do respond in Spanish, by the way.
[02:50:17.629 --> 02:50:19.852]  Don't you think it's racially insensitive to run against Maxime?
[02:50:19.872 --> 02:50:22.716]  You should just respond in fluent Spanish just to mess with them.
[02:50:24.152 --> 02:50:25.553]  And I do do that, actually.
[02:50:25.633 --> 02:50:27.555]  And a lot of people are like, what's going on?
[02:50:28.195 --> 02:50:30.337]  I had a fundraiser at a park in Lomita Park.
[02:50:31.057 --> 02:50:32.058]  This was six months ago.
[02:50:32.598 --> 02:50:35.961]  And they labeled my event a white supremacist event, KKK rally.
[02:50:36.061 --> 02:50:41.725]  And they expected to see the Klan there with the white hoods and everything.
[02:50:42.305 --> 02:50:42.866]  And guess what?
[02:50:43.086 --> 02:50:43.886]  They didn't see that.
[02:50:44.046 --> 02:50:45.567]  It's a mariachi band, isn't it?
[02:50:45.587 --> 02:50:47.509]  The first thing I said is, hola, como estan todos?
[02:50:47.749 --> 02:50:51.692]  Yeah, but you were also telling me something about you're Cuban.
[02:50:51.732 --> 02:50:53.153]  So they say that doesn't count for Hispanic.
[02:50:53.999 --> 02:50:56.320]  Yeah, Cubans generally vote Republicans.
[02:50:56.380 --> 02:50:57.321]  They hate the Cubans.
[02:50:57.361 --> 02:50:59.142]  The Cubans are worse than white people.
[02:50:59.202 --> 02:50:59.943]  Tell us about that.
[02:51:00.023 --> 02:51:02.064]  What's the Spanish equivalent of an Uncle Tom?
[02:51:02.164 --> 02:51:02.764]  What do they call you?
[02:51:04.145 --> 02:51:05.426]  You know, there's a lot of names.
[02:51:05.446 --> 02:51:11.790]  They call you Vendeeville, Trader, they call you Cracker, Coconut, all these names.
[02:51:11.830 --> 02:51:12.610]  I mean, they have names.
[02:51:12.910 --> 02:51:14.151]  They have a lot of names in the book.
[02:51:16.374 --> 02:51:17.536]  You know, all I want is free market.
[02:51:17.556 --> 02:51:18.538]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:51:19.579 --> 02:51:20.401]  No, but they don't believe you.
[02:51:20.461 --> 02:51:22.404]  They don't believe you because the free market is racist.
[02:51:22.464 --> 02:51:24.948]  It is an expression of cishet white patriarchal oppression.
[02:51:25.849 --> 02:51:27.192]  But, but they gotta like you though.
[02:51:27.372 --> 02:51:29.015]  What does it left you about your Mexican half then?
[02:51:30.174 --> 02:51:31.635]  I mean, they don't want to mention it.
[02:51:31.755 --> 02:51:32.955]  I mean, they want to get away from it.
[02:51:33.115 --> 02:51:35.076]  They don't want to mention that I'm half Mexican.
[02:51:35.356 --> 02:51:41.739]  You know, by the way, 54% of my district that's Hispanic Latino, about 48% of it is of Mexican descent.
[02:51:42.079 --> 02:51:45.000]  So that's one thing they really don't want to talk about because they are threatened.
[02:51:45.300 --> 02:51:49.922]  I mean, in the first time in 30 years, Maxine Waters has a campaign office in the district.
[02:51:50.342 --> 02:51:54.564]  I just drove by and I saw it and I was like, wow, she actually is trying to campaign actively now.
[02:51:54.964 --> 02:51:56.405]  But, you know, she's too late in the game.
[02:51:56.445 --> 02:51:58.127]  I mean, I've already done this for over a year.
[02:51:58.447 --> 02:51:59.008]  I've been busy.
[02:51:59.048 --> 02:52:00.169]  I've been walking door-to-door.
[02:52:00.229 --> 02:52:01.910]  I've been with all the volunteers I have.
[02:52:02.310 --> 02:52:07.375]  We have over 40... Do Hispanics notice, too, how many Hispanics are in real power positions now under Trump?
[02:52:07.395 --> 02:52:09.056]  I mean, more than Democrats ever did.
[02:52:09.076 --> 02:52:10.558]  And how many women are in real power positions?
[02:52:10.638 --> 02:52:11.378]  Yes, of course.
[02:52:11.398 --> 02:52:12.039]  Or gay men.
[02:52:12.059 --> 02:52:15.282]  All this stuff you see... Look at Richard Grinnell.
[02:52:15.862 --> 02:52:21.145]  The US ambassador to Germany that, you know, they would not confirm, they would not confirm, they would not confirm.
[02:52:21.465 --> 02:52:28.209]  Trump appointed an out and proud gay guy as the US's ambassador to Germany, one of the most important diplomatic positions imaginable.
[02:52:28.589 --> 02:52:34.232]  And both, you know, Senates and, excuse me, both Republicans and Democrats are dragging their feet over that one.
[02:52:34.252 --> 02:52:36.874]  You know, Mitch McConnell wouldn't pull a, whatever,
[02:52:37.194 --> 02:52:38.914]  Trump isn't doing it because of what color you are.
[02:52:39.214 --> 02:52:41.035]  He's doing it on people that can do a good job.
[02:52:41.235 --> 02:52:44.195]  Right, and everything you think about America is not true.
[02:52:44.215 --> 02:52:45.356]  Like, I went down to the border recently.
[02:52:45.376 --> 02:52:48.996]  I had a tour of the wall prototypes from some guys I know in ICE.
[02:52:49.516 --> 02:52:51.037]  And you meet, like, the Border Patrol agents.
[02:52:51.117 --> 02:52:52.737]  It's like 70% Hispanic.
[02:52:52.957 --> 02:52:58.498]  They hate the illegal immigrants because they had to get here the right way, go through the motions, fill out the forms, pay their dues.
[02:52:58.558 --> 02:53:01.599]  Well, they also know Mexico has a big wall and gives you six months hard labor.
[02:53:02.979 --> 02:53:04.421]  Omar, are people starting to wake up?
[02:53:04.441 --> 02:53:06.203]  Because I want to talk about the exodus out of California.
[02:53:06.283 --> 02:53:07.445]  California is a gorgeous state.
[02:53:07.925 --> 02:53:12.992]  The area you're in, though, is like a bowl of radioactive, you know, just all the smog, everything.
[02:53:13.592 --> 02:53:15.975]  I mean, and then people are exiting.
[02:53:16.015 --> 02:53:16.936]  The producers are exiting.
[02:53:16.956 --> 02:53:19.680]  What's going to happen to California if we don't get people like you elected?
[02:53:20.993 --> 02:53:23.555]  Not only that, Toyota's also left California.
[02:53:23.575 --> 02:53:24.435]  They've gone to Texas.
[02:53:24.675 --> 02:53:27.237]  They've gone there because of better economic opportunities.
[02:53:27.877 --> 02:53:31.980]  We have to make sure that we're bringing back jobs here into our district, into the state of California.
[02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:35.022]  And by the way, I'd love California to cut taxes and take jobs from us.
[02:53:35.382 --> 02:53:36.283]  I want a good country.
[02:53:36.303 --> 02:53:37.203]  I'm not against California.
[02:53:37.463 --> 02:53:38.424]  It's a huge economy.
[02:53:38.504 --> 02:53:40.125]  It's basically a country in its own right.
[02:53:40.165 --> 02:53:43.067]  Everyone has a vested interest in California doing well.
[02:53:43.307 --> 02:53:43.807]  Sure.
[02:53:43.908 --> 02:53:45.569]  So Omar, I keep interrupting you.
[02:53:45.669 --> 02:53:46.809]  You're bringing up great points.
[02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:47.530]  What else should people know?
[02:53:47.890 --> 02:53:49.351]  We really have to flip the state around.
[02:53:49.391 --> 02:53:50.231]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:53:50.251 --> 02:53:55.833]  If we're all energetic and excited about changing the state, we have to make sure that we're going out and talking to people.
[02:53:56.173 --> 02:53:58.854]  But when it comes down to it, it's just going door-to-door talking to voters.
[02:53:59.494 --> 02:54:04.176]  You're not going to change someone's mind by just sending a mail, by going through social media.
[02:54:04.236 --> 02:54:05.257]  You have to go personal.
[02:54:05.277 --> 02:54:06.157]  We have to go door-to-door.
[02:54:06.477 --> 02:54:07.298]  You have to talk to them.
[02:54:07.318 --> 02:54:16.124]  Have any of the people's doors you've gone to, and I'm not being mischievous or signaling, I would guess it's probably white liberals that are most aggressive towards you, because in my own life, that's who you are.
[02:54:16.144 --> 02:54:16.544]  Yes, they are.
[02:54:16.605 --> 02:54:17.425]  I 100% agree with you, Alex.
[02:54:18.186 --> 02:54:22.889]  Most of the time when I get door-knocked doors, the white liberals, yes, they're the most aggressive towards me.
[02:54:22.909 --> 02:54:24.190]  They'll slam the doors at me.
[02:54:24.430 --> 02:54:25.951]  They'll try to chase me off the property.
[02:54:26.011 --> 02:54:27.352]  I mean, I've had that one time already.
[02:54:27.392 --> 02:54:28.133]  I had to call the police.
[02:54:28.233 --> 02:54:31.475]  And see, they've taken one form of entitlement and placed it for another.
[02:54:32.356 --> 02:54:43.085]  I think you should just crouch and start yelling in Spanish and begging for mercy and just have the footage of this white liberal looming over a Hispanic candidate who's begging for mercy.
[02:54:43.125 --> 02:54:45.727]  Omar, how do the entitled white people act?
[02:54:46.288 --> 02:54:53.294]  They automatically assume that I have to vote Democrat, that I have to be anti-Trump, that I have to follow all these other things.
[02:54:53.314 --> 02:54:55.295]  So their whole worldview is totally stereotypical?
[02:54:55.596 --> 02:54:55.716]  Yeah.
[02:54:56.016 --> 02:54:57.337]  Yeah, and it's ignorance.
[02:54:57.397 --> 02:55:00.398]  I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, it comes down to how can you support Trump?
[02:55:00.458 --> 02:55:02.238]  I was like, well, I support him because he's a businessman.
[02:55:02.498 --> 02:55:03.459]  He supports America.
[02:55:03.479 --> 02:55:04.519]  He wants to put Americans first.
[02:55:04.739 --> 02:55:05.800]  He wants to protect our border.
[02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:12.882]  It's like, well, by him building the wall, that's discriminating against people that want to come into the country.
[02:55:12.922 --> 02:55:15.303]  No, it's discriminating against legal citizens.
[02:55:15.763 --> 02:55:21.565]  Because there are people who go through a line, that go through a process that takes a lot of time, like my family, took 10 years.
[02:55:21.625 --> 02:55:22.905]  Your greatest handicap.
[02:55:22.925 --> 02:55:25.906]  We should make it easier for the good people, no matter what color they are to get in.
[02:55:26.227 --> 02:55:27.827]  The Democrats want a permanent underclass.
[02:55:28.207 --> 02:55:32.089]  We see your problem, Omar, your greatest handicap is that you're in the country illegally.
[02:55:32.629 --> 02:55:36.730]  Because if you didn't have papers, you could probably steam ahead of Maxine.
[02:55:36.750 --> 02:55:37.030]  I agree.
[02:55:37.230 --> 02:55:39.471]  You're going to keep hosting with us when Roger Stone pops in.
[02:55:39.571 --> 02:55:40.211]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:40.571 --> 02:55:42.612]  And I appreciate you doing this marathon with us.
[02:55:43.012 --> 02:55:45.013]  Again, myleonopolisdangerous.com.
[02:55:46.073 --> 02:55:48.235]  In closing, Omar, you've got to come back very, very soon.
[02:55:48.575 --> 02:55:50.396]  I know in some of the polls, you're neck and neck with her.
[02:55:50.416 --> 02:55:52.157]  Other fake polls, you're 10 points behind.
[02:55:52.197 --> 02:55:55.199]  But all I know is, I mean, you've got a good chance at winning, my friend.
[02:55:55.980 --> 02:55:57.581]  I mean, we're doing a lot of great things, Alex.
[02:55:57.621 --> 02:55:59.962]  I mean, we have over 1,200 signs up in the district.
[02:56:00.483 --> 02:56:01.683]  We have 40 bus benches.
[02:56:02.164 --> 02:56:02.984]  We're getting out there.
[02:56:03.004 --> 02:56:03.885]  We're going door to door.
[02:56:03.905 --> 02:56:04.765]  We've just sent out a mail.
[02:56:04.825 --> 02:56:06.666]  It's over 100,000 people in the district.
[02:56:07.147 --> 02:56:10.529]  We're doing a lot of great things right now, and it's just going forward every day.
[02:56:10.589 --> 02:56:13.411]  So, I mean, we're going past June and then going to November after this.
[02:56:14.011 --> 02:56:24.955]  Well, I think you're going to win, but even if you don't, you win by taking action and all the millions you've educated have been all over national TV, local TV, and you're building your name, and one way or another, she needs to get indicted.
[02:56:25.075 --> 02:56:27.356]  I mean, man, all the corruption she's been involved in.
[02:56:27.376 --> 02:56:31.137]  Don't locals know how she gives her husband, what is it, $40 million or something?
[02:56:32.117 --> 02:56:39.600]  I mean, if someone walks into politics wealthy, broke, and then they walk out wealthy, I mean, that person's a crook.
[02:56:40.771 --> 02:56:42.812]  I forget, it's like $20 million here, $30 million there.
[02:56:42.872 --> 02:56:44.694]  How many millions has she given her husband's bank?
[02:56:45.694 --> 02:56:54.060]  She's bailed, well, her husband held an interest in that bank, and when they got the bailout, he got about $50 million, something around there, that sum.
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:58.143]  Yeah, I mean, I know she's listed as the most corrupt member of Congress to never be indicted.
[02:56:58.643 --> 02:56:58.923]  Really?
[02:56:59.404 --> 02:56:59.604]  Yeah.
[02:57:00.384 --> 02:57:05.568]  I mean, and her grandson got, had a felony dropped out to a misdemeanor for bribery.
[02:57:07.034 --> 02:57:10.619]  So it runs in the family, these kinds of financially related dodgy deals.
[02:57:10.639 --> 02:57:15.645]  Not only that, the daughter took about a close to a million dollars in direct mail.
[02:57:15.985 --> 02:57:19.550]  And to be honest with you, I looked up some of the charges.
[02:57:19.570 --> 02:57:22.313]  $30,000 in consulting on the FEC report.
[02:57:22.333 --> 02:57:25.678]  By the way, I don't care if it's a white guy, Hispanic guy, or black guy, or an Asian woman.
[02:57:26.298 --> 02:57:30.140]  I want to just have a patriot who's pro-American, pro-free market, we know it works.
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:32.061]  So I'm for Omar, not because of what color he is.
[02:57:32.622 --> 02:57:36.544]  If he's, oh well, just black Trump, you know, light brown, well then I'm light brown.
[02:57:36.564 --> 02:57:37.864]  I guess I get Trump by Maxine too.
[02:57:38.144 --> 02:57:39.145]  This is insane!
[02:57:39.165 --> 02:57:41.066]  I've been to the tanning salon three times this month.
[02:57:41.126 --> 02:57:42.787]  It's making me less culpable by the day.
[02:57:43.407 --> 02:57:43.928]  Absolutely.
[02:57:43.948 --> 02:57:45.188]  Well, I got a little bit of a Native American.
[02:57:45.208 --> 02:57:46.089]  That's why I get good tans.
[02:57:46.109 --> 02:57:47.670]  Hey, Omar, you're awesome.
[02:57:47.690 --> 02:57:48.430]  We love you, brother.
[02:57:49.010 --> 02:57:51.111]  Omar Navarro for Congress Against Mad Maxine.
[02:57:51.171 --> 02:57:51.932]  OmarNavarro.com.
[02:57:52.853 --> 02:57:53.453]  Alpha Power.
[02:57:53.813 --> 02:57:54.614]  Here's what you want to know.
[02:57:54.834 --> 02:58:00.816]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:58:01.477 --> 02:58:05.018]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:58:05.899 --> 02:58:13.862]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:58:14.402 --> 02:58:17.764]  The average male or female enhancement
[02:58:18.724 --> 02:58:21.725]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:58:22.005 --> 02:58:23.705]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:58:24.065 --> 02:58:29.147]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and I say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:58:29.447 --> 02:58:37.069]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product.
[02:58:37.489 --> 02:58:37.769]  In them.
[02:58:38.170 --> 02:58:39.211]  Nobody else does that.
[02:58:39.271 --> 02:58:42.013]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:58:42.353 --> 02:58:44.355]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:58:44.755 --> 02:58:50.100]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:58:52.742 --> 02:58:55.923]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:58:56.383 --> 02:58:57.703]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:58.184 --> 02:59:09.627]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:59:10.407 --> 02:59:19.314]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:59:19.614 --> 02:59:30.442]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:30.942 --> 02:59:33.264]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:59:33.605 --> 02:59:34.966]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:35.346 --> 02:59:44.956]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:45.076 --> 02:59:47.238]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:59:47.759 --> 02:59:52.624]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:59:57.537 --> 03:00:09.489]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:09.529 --> 03:00:13.092]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news.
[03:00:13.633 --> 03:00:15.575]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.159 --> 03:00:30.216]  Sometimes I feel I've got to run away I've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
[03:00:33.215 --> 03:00:37.257]  All right, Gerald Salente, the top trends forecaster, is going to be hosting this hour.
[03:00:37.297 --> 03:00:46.240]  But Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, the guy being demonized as the Russian operative and all this crapola, Milo Yiannopoulos tried to shotgun here with me.
[03:00:46.580 --> 03:00:48.021]  He called up like 10 minutes ago frantic.
[03:00:48.061 --> 03:00:50.202]  He said, I've got just devastating
[03:00:50.862 --> 03:00:52.303]  Information about censorship.
[03:00:52.343 --> 03:00:56.985]  So as soon as we get him on, we'll get that report in the hopper and then have Gerald Cilente.
[03:00:57.305 --> 03:00:58.966]  And there's Gerald right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:59.746 --> 03:01:00.726]  He is ready to come up.
[03:01:00.766 --> 03:01:02.767]  So a few minutes till we get Roger on.
[03:01:03.087 --> 03:01:04.088]  Good to have you, my friend.
[03:01:04.328 --> 03:01:06.429]  What do you have coming up today, Gerald Cilente?
[03:01:07.209 --> 03:01:11.191]  Well, you know, it's the what's going on in the Middle East is the big news.
[03:01:12.051 --> 03:01:18.534]  And we really suggest that people take this seriously in concerns that prepare for the worse.
[03:01:19.304 --> 03:01:24.768]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're prepared, you know, you didn't lose anything.
[03:01:25.188 --> 03:01:29.451]  But if you're not prepared and the worst happens, you could lose everything.
[03:01:29.971 --> 03:01:46.663]  So, for example, all those products that you sell, you know, the foods and all the other supplements and whatever it might be, and you know me, one of my GCs, three Gs, guns, gold and a getaway plan, because this thing can really become explosive.
[03:01:47.555 --> 03:01:51.318]  And if something happens, remember what they did after 9-11.
[03:01:51.338 --> 03:01:53.340]  They closed Wall Street.
[03:01:54.201 --> 03:01:55.842]  I had certificates of deposit.
[03:01:55.862 --> 03:01:57.924]  In those days, you used to get a thing called interest rates.
[03:01:58.444 --> 03:01:59.305]  And I couldn't get them out.
[03:01:59.385 --> 03:02:00.486]  Wall Street was closed.
[03:02:01.427 --> 03:02:05.550]  So this could be very serious in what's brewing in the Middle East.
[03:02:06.151 --> 03:02:09.534]  And that's one of the big things we're looking at very closely.
[03:02:12.436 --> 03:02:14.358]  Well, you know, here's my deal.
[03:02:15.419 --> 03:02:18.940]  I'm not against the Palestinians, and I was against the Iraq War 1 and 2.
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:20.840]  I've been against all the stuff just like you have been.
[03:02:21.681 --> 03:02:23.941]  But Soros wants to destroy Israel.
[03:02:24.101 --> 03:02:29.743]  And whenever the Arabic groups kill, you know, hundreds of thousands of people, the news doesn't cover it during the Arab Spring.
[03:02:29.783 --> 03:02:34.984]  But then when Israel has rioters, people attacking, and kills some people, then it's like they're the worst people on earth.
[03:02:35.044 --> 03:02:38.605]  And all I'm saying is, there's this larger globalist system
[03:02:39.425 --> 03:02:43.427]  That he just wants to keep the Middle East churning, and Trump wants a peace deal, I know, there.
[03:02:43.827 --> 03:02:45.688]  So he's got to first butter Israel up to do it.
[03:02:45.708 --> 03:02:52.872]  I mean, Pompeo, or Pompeo is the way you say it, I'm sure you're pronouncing it right, post-nuclear North Korea economy will rival South Korea.
[03:02:53.232 --> 03:02:59.035]  I mean, we're cutting the Chinese off by saying, hey, we'll make you a free market like South Korea.
[03:02:59.055 --> 03:03:02.096]  I mean, I just really, overall, I just trust Trump.
[03:03:02.557 --> 03:03:04.858]  And whereas I have big issues with some of the things Israel does,
[03:03:05.638 --> 03:03:08.419]  You're either blow Israel off the map or you're pro-Israel.
[03:03:08.459 --> 03:03:09.260]  Then I'm pro-Israel.
[03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:12.321]  And I understand you've been critical of Israel show of eye, but what do you think?
[03:03:13.582 --> 03:03:15.343]  Well, again, you know, it's bigger than Israel.
[03:03:15.363 --> 03:03:16.963]  It's what's going on in Syria.
[03:03:17.484 --> 03:03:20.245]  It's going on with the Saudis.
[03:03:20.725 --> 03:03:22.166]  Well, look what they've done to Yemen.
[03:03:22.526 --> 03:03:27.548]  And now they're fighting their partners, the United Arab Emirates, the territory over there.
[03:03:28.289 --> 03:03:32.891]  And again, it's Iran is really in the focus here.
[03:03:33.693 --> 03:03:41.706]  So, and again, we're tying it all together, Alex, in the sense that when you look at retail sales, for example, they haven't been that strong.
[03:03:42.548 --> 03:03:47.516]  Now, all of a sudden, we've seen gasoline prices go up, what, 50 cents this year?
[03:03:48.682 --> 03:03:49.183]  In a year.
[03:03:49.723 --> 03:03:52.024]  And now you're looking at the data today.
[03:03:52.044 --> 03:03:54.666]  You just saw Brent Crude take another spike.
[03:03:55.226 --> 03:03:57.547]  And by the way, we know Saudi Arabia asked for that.
[03:03:57.567 --> 03:03:59.528]  They asked for that of Trump because they're going bankrupt.
[03:03:59.849 --> 03:04:02.690]  I know you'll give us all the inside baseball on the other side.
[03:04:02.710 --> 03:04:07.093]  I know you've got several websites that I visit routinely on a daily basis.
[03:04:07.493 --> 03:04:09.614]  But what's the best one to visit?
[03:04:09.654 --> 03:04:10.435]  TrendsResearch.com?
[03:04:11.502 --> 03:04:13.103]  Yes, TrendsResearch.com.
[03:04:13.183 --> 03:04:13.544]  Thank you.
[03:04:13.804 --> 03:04:14.724]  All right, we'll be right back.
[03:04:15.605 --> 03:04:17.667]  Milo will obviously be able to pop in, too.
[03:04:17.687 --> 03:04:21.009]  In fact, I want to get everybody here in a star chamber with quick comments when we come back.
[03:04:21.069 --> 03:04:29.635]  Roger Stone has the biggest news ever concerning Facebook censorship, and they hope to just keep censoring a little more, a little more, until we give up and don't care anymore.
[03:04:29.715 --> 03:04:31.937]  But they caught us, okay?
[03:04:31.957 --> 03:04:32.657]  I'm going to admit it.
[03:04:33.738 --> 03:04:35.840]  It's a big BuzzFeed headline.
[03:04:37.079 --> 03:04:37.759]  They caught us, folks.
[03:04:37.799 --> 03:04:38.220]  They caught us.
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:45.183]  They say that one of the many, many, we got like more than 15 Facebook channels with 900,000 likes.
[03:04:45.203 --> 03:04:46.664]  We have our bigger ones have 3 million.
[03:04:47.864 --> 03:04:55.228]  Yeah, it said that a computer accessed our website on Facebook from Switzerland.
[03:04:55.888 --> 03:04:56.588]  They caught us, folks.
[03:04:56.628 --> 03:04:59.770]  They caught Dan Lyman, our reporter, over there opening an article.
[03:04:59.830 --> 03:05:02.191]  I mean, but they said that we're about to be banned because of this.
[03:05:04.005 --> 03:05:07.307]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[03:05:07.668 --> 03:05:15.133]  Between debt crises, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply of storable meals is crucial.

[03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:21.303]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.702 --> 03:06:24.523]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[03:06:24.563 --> 03:06:29.125]  Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster, is going to be taking over in just a few minutes.
[03:06:30.446 --> 03:06:34.067]  But, Roger Stone joins us with big breaking news.
[03:06:34.508 --> 03:06:37.269]  On the censorship front, Milo Yiannopoulos riding shotgun.
[03:06:37.669 --> 03:06:39.130]  We've got quite a powwow going on.
[03:06:39.190 --> 03:06:40.130]  Roger, give us the latest.
[03:06:41.371 --> 03:06:47.994]  Well, Alex, I'm calling in from an undisclosed location in the back room of a cigar store somewhere in South Florida.
[03:06:48.943 --> 03:06:49.763]  We're good to go.
[03:07:04.450 --> 03:07:09.931]  And I have used Facebook very effectively in my campaigns to sell my various books.
[03:07:11.331 --> 03:07:22.634]  I got a call today from the campaign of Michael Williams, a crusading pro-Trump state senator who is broken from the PAC and is running for governor of Georgia.
[03:07:23.834 --> 03:07:29.575]  And his campaign manager told me that when they do their paid promotions on Facebook,
[03:07:30.288 --> 03:07:41.634]  And they want to reach supporters of InfoWars or Alex Jones, a box pops up and says, as of May 24th, those subscribers can no longer be accessed.
[03:07:42.834 --> 03:07:51.298]  I immediately checked on my own paid book promotions, and indeed, I can no longer reach supporters of InfoWars or Alex Jones.
[03:07:52.319 --> 03:07:54.720]  I have the screen grabs on all of this.
[03:07:55.202 --> 03:07:55.922]  That's wild.
[03:07:55.942 --> 03:08:00.865]  So they literally don't want people's money who are trying to reach supporters.
[03:08:00.885 --> 03:08:03.246]  And let's explain, we're not being paid this money.
[03:08:03.626 --> 03:08:07.548]  Facebook's being paid and we're being totally isolated from everyone.
[03:08:07.848 --> 03:08:19.794]  They don't even, and this happened, I will tell you, I can't name the website because we do do some business with them, but one of the biggest conservative websites in the world turned me down when I wanted to advertise my book with them a year ago.
[03:08:20.214 --> 03:08:31.003]  And then because conservative media is all struggling, they're all flailing around and frantic, they came back recently and offered us discounted CPMs, like super cheap advertising, when they wouldn't even take our money.
[03:08:33.184 --> 03:08:42.572]  When I attempt to post the InfoWars store link to buy my new book, Stoned Rules, in a Facebook ad, it is rejected for content.
[03:08:43.092 --> 03:08:44.133]  Rejected for content.
[03:08:44.373 --> 03:08:46.635]  Wow, so we have been put into an electronic gulag.
[03:08:46.655 --> 03:08:48.116]  Well, I haven't announced this yet, but I'll do it now.
[03:08:49.076 --> 03:08:50.779]  They sell rebel flags, which is fine.
[03:08:50.819 --> 03:08:55.348]  They sell the learned elders of Zion, where I don't agree with that, but, you know, books are books.
[03:08:55.368 --> 03:08:57.793]  They sell Hitler's Mein Kampf at the local Barnes and Noble.
[03:08:58.134 --> 03:08:58.595]  That's fine.
[03:08:59.075 --> 03:09:00.138]  All of that can be sold.
[03:09:01.055 --> 03:09:08.703]  But they will not let us sell any of our products on their big merchant account system, and they said because of hate.
[03:09:09.243 --> 03:09:11.486]  And Roger's new book is like an etiquette book.
[03:09:11.786 --> 03:09:18.153]  Roger's new book is sort of like a guide for life for the modern gentleman, including, you know, some political rules, some etiquette rules.
[03:09:18.273 --> 03:09:19.514]  So you learn this from a Republican...
[03:09:24.491 --> 03:09:30.076]  For Governor Michael Williams, who has been on InfoWars with us, who is a true patriot.
[03:09:30.476 --> 03:09:36.822]  He's running against Country Club Cagle, the Lieutenant Governor of Bushman, in a hard-fought primary.
[03:09:37.442 --> 03:09:44.188]  They credit InfoWars and the coverage they've gotten for as one of the major factors in this guy breaking out of the pack.
[03:09:44.788 --> 03:09:46.130]  He is the real deal.
[03:09:46.431 --> 03:09:47.212]  And so there it is.
[03:09:47.232 --> 03:09:54.483]  They don't want people politically getting access to hard-charging info warriors who want to save the country.
[03:09:54.864 --> 03:09:58.789]  And so this is ahead of 2018, killing the base that they know beat Hillary.
[03:09:59.030 --> 03:10:00.392]  And that's why Trump should be concerned.
[03:10:00.512 --> 03:10:06.594]  And this is also about, of course, reducing the number of people who are going to get the messages that are going to propel them to vote for those candidates.
[03:10:06.875 --> 03:10:11.376]  This isn't just about strangling media organizations that they don't like.
[03:10:11.416 --> 03:10:12.657]  It's about strangling voters!
[03:10:12.937 --> 03:10:14.438]  It's about stopping voter turnout.
[03:10:14.478 --> 03:10:20.940]  The Democratic Party and Big Tech is beyond, you know, Jim Crow laws, guys with shotguns keeping blacks from voting.
[03:10:21.220 --> 03:10:22.881]  You never even know the people exist.
[03:10:23.201 --> 03:10:30.104]  They're breaking the link between candidates and the press and that candidate's own supporters by preventing, you know,
[03:10:30.604 --> 03:10:33.866]  But Roger, isn't this serious campaign violations?
[03:10:33.886 --> 03:10:40.150]  Because the new thing in BuzzFeed is a new Facebook feature shows which pro-Trump Facebook pages are run from overseas.
[03:10:40.610 --> 03:10:48.535]  Well, since there's no real Russia stuff, because Russia can't get its act together, I'm sorry, it's true, they say Alex Jones has a Facebook with 900,000 likes.
[03:10:48.555 --> 03:10:50.617]  Based in Switzerland.
[03:10:50.697 --> 03:10:52.218]  Based in Switzerland.
[03:10:53.138 --> 03:10:57.581]  Because Facebook told them, oh, someone's posting from there.
[03:10:57.621 --> 03:10:59.322]  Yeah, the American Dan Lyman.
[03:10:59.642 --> 03:11:01.484]  You know we have a bureau in Europe.
[03:11:02.184 --> 03:11:03.445]  Wow, you really caught us.
[03:11:03.465 --> 03:11:08.068]  Yeah, no, you have 900,000 followers because you've earned every single one of them.
[03:11:08.128 --> 03:11:10.930]  But now they don't want anybody to be able to communicate with them.
[03:11:11.391 --> 03:11:11.571]  Yes.
[03:11:12.112 --> 03:11:14.214]  Listen, next time you... What does the President... Here's the deal.
[03:11:14.374 --> 03:11:14.934]  What do we do?
[03:11:14.974 --> 03:11:15.975]  This is racketeering.
[03:11:16.276 --> 03:11:17.617]  This is anti-free speech.
[03:11:17.917 --> 03:11:19.199]  This is suppression of the vote.
[03:11:19.539 --> 03:11:22.061]  It's like you're trying to call somebody up and they, like, disconnect the lines.
[03:11:22.081 --> 03:11:22.602]  It's the same thing.
[03:11:22.722 --> 03:11:23.843]  What does the President do?
[03:11:24.163 --> 03:11:25.104]  What does Congress do?
[03:11:25.124 --> 03:11:28.327]  Because you see these tech giants get up in front of Congress, they play dumb.
[03:11:29.421 --> 03:11:30.221]  I know nothing.
[03:11:30.321 --> 03:11:31.021]  I know nothing.
[03:11:31.241 --> 03:11:32.142]  What do we do, Roger?
[03:11:32.162 --> 03:11:34.062]  We have two challenges.
[03:11:34.142 --> 03:11:45.244]  The largest one is getting the Republicans on the Hill, particularly the chairman of the subcommittee on telecommunications, to understand this issue and understand that it violates antitrust.
[03:11:45.384 --> 03:11:46.985]  That's their vulnerability.
[03:11:47.345 --> 03:11:52.946]  The one thing the left doesn't want is specific exposure of their manipulation of the media.
[03:11:53.346 --> 03:11:56.367]  Well, please send this to Kit Daniels or Adon Salazar or whoever.
[03:11:56.727 --> 03:11:57.667]  And the headline here is...
[03:11:59.170 --> 03:12:03.432]  Facebook blocking Republican candidates from Republican voters.
[03:12:03.933 --> 03:12:07.735]  Because that's what, and they know InfoWars is big, they know we've got active people that care.
[03:12:07.755 --> 03:12:10.756]  Look, I mean, this is not a thing about hate, this is a thing about politics.
[03:12:10.816 --> 03:12:17.820]  You have, by any measure, by any metric, one of the biggest radio shows, quote, you know, stroke internet shows in the country.
[03:12:18.500 --> 03:12:24.722]  If it were a hateful, nonsensical, crazy kind of outfit, you would have a limit to the audience.
[03:12:24.782 --> 03:12:33.265]  But the truth is, it is inclusive, it is funny, it is open, but they want to build a caricature of what we are, they can't have the real one exist.
[03:12:33.325 --> 03:12:37.066]  But the genuinely hateful stuff reaches a ceiling beyond which it does not grow.
[03:12:37.126 --> 03:12:41.648]  And you saw that with the alt-right, with the actually white nationalist, and the actually anti-semitic, and the actually hateful people.
[03:12:41.708 --> 03:12:41.988]  They hate us.
[03:12:42.388 --> 03:12:45.610]  They hate us, they hate you, they hate me, and they get to a certain size and can't grow beyond that.
[03:12:45.851 --> 03:12:52.876]  You have one of the biggest shows in the country, and they are identifying it as a source of... And let's be clear, this isn't money we'd make.
[03:12:53.336 --> 03:12:57.519]  This is a Republican candidate going, OK, we've won the primary, we're going to move forward.
[03:12:57.539 --> 03:13:00.241]  We want to contact the InfoWars activist.
[03:13:00.621 --> 03:13:02.462]  Facebook is turning money down.
[03:13:02.643 --> 03:13:02.943]  Yes, sir.
[03:13:03.343 --> 03:13:13.347]  These aren't Russian bots, this is InfoWars trying to be contacted and Facebook wants to smokescreen this, so they're releasing, well, somebody uploaded something from Switzerland.
[03:13:13.668 --> 03:13:19.170]  This is Facebook reaching the same levels of political bias at the expense of making money that Twitter arrived at.
[03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.990]  Well, this is the level of it.
[03:13:20.030 --> 03:13:27.714]  Let's say I went on, you know, my wife wants, never been to Germany, she's part German, she wants to go for her birthday to Germany.
[03:13:28.434 --> 03:13:30.515]  And don't post anything on Facebook from Germany.
[03:13:30.675 --> 03:13:36.798]  I was about to say, if I was to post from the thing, the Germans are in control because it's all data stamps!
[03:13:37.158 --> 03:13:40.159]  Hey, did you know you're under Swiss control, Roger?
[03:13:40.219 --> 03:13:41.420]  I didn't know the Swiss were running us.
[03:13:42.271 --> 03:13:44.693]  I think people need to see this in context, Alex.
[03:13:44.733 --> 03:13:48.536]  This is part of the same war on censorship that they are running against us.
[03:13:48.977 --> 03:14:05.610]  This is connected directly to the phony, frivolous, but expensive lawsuits against you and me that are designed, even though they're baseless, to generate a negative headline that they then can use as a rationale to turn around and limit our reach on Facebook.
[03:14:05.650 --> 03:14:08.452]  It's the same campaign- Well, exactly, and we've gotta get-
[03:14:08.772 --> 03:14:11.675]  Because we're putting EuropeWars.com on Facebook in Europe.
[03:14:12.095 --> 03:14:16.319]  We've got to get the evil mastermind Lex Luthor aka Dan Lyman on tomorrow.
[03:14:16.920 --> 03:14:21.004]  I mean, this evil person goes and shoots videos, he interviews people, he writes articles.
[03:14:21.384 --> 03:14:23.666]  An American in Europe is reporting, Milo!
[03:14:23.686 --> 03:14:24.587]  We must stop this!
[03:14:24.727 --> 03:14:39.440]  I just wonder what will happen when the BBC's Russia Bureau, that is based in Moscow, starts posting stories about, not just Americans talking about America, who happen to be based in Switzerland, but BBC journalists from England in Russia talking about Russia.
[03:14:39.460 --> 03:14:41.141]  I'm sure that's going to get flagged by Facebook, isn't it?
[03:14:41.402 --> 03:14:43.103]  How do they think they're going to get away with this, Roger?
[03:14:43.143 --> 03:14:44.064]  This is so stupid!
[03:14:45.635 --> 03:14:51.257]  Well, the President needs to direct his Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust to start reviewing the issues here.
[03:14:51.317 --> 03:14:57.379]  On the other hand, he doesn't seem to have much control over the Justice Department, as long as it's run by Mr. Rosenstein.
[03:14:57.459 --> 03:14:59.560]  What he needs to do, I think, is pretty obvious.
[03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:00.660]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:15:00.700 --> 03:15:07.643]  And then meanwhile, you've got the doddering, probably KKK Grand Dragon over there, doesn't even know what planet he's on, like,
[03:15:08.523 --> 03:15:12.646]  50 years for marijuana!
[03:15:13.006 --> 03:15:15.727]  Sadly, I say he's either compromised or he's senile.
[03:15:15.787 --> 03:15:16.988]  It's one or the other.
[03:15:17.308 --> 03:15:19.530]  I say death penalty for dope!
[03:15:19.990 --> 03:15:22.191]  I'm Sessions and I said so!
[03:15:22.251 --> 03:15:26.474]  He's like the great-grandfather you see at Thanksgiving, you know?
[03:15:26.554 --> 03:15:28.895]  Who you just sort of let ramble for a bit.
[03:15:28.915 --> 03:15:31.316]  I got my shins blown off in WW2!
[03:15:31.517 --> 03:15:32.717]  Nobody actually does what he says.
[03:15:32.737 --> 03:15:33.918]  You just let him talk for a bit.
[03:15:33.958 --> 03:15:35.379]  We have him running the Justice Department.
[03:15:36.400 --> 03:15:39.482]  We have appointed Foghorn Leghorn to be Attorney General.
[03:15:39.622 --> 03:15:41.382]  I say, I say, I say!
[03:15:41.883 --> 03:15:46.705]  We gonna put the President in jail, but you get that marijuana, you go to prison too!
[03:15:46.905 --> 03:15:47.986]  Roger's back on!
[03:15:48.706 --> 03:15:53.728]  Roger's back on with The War Room in 45 minutes, but straight ahead is the great Gerald Celente.
[03:15:53.748 --> 03:15:57.050]  TrendsResearch.com, Dangerous.com, InfoWars.com.
[03:15:57.750 --> 03:16:00.751]  Onward through the fog of insanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:16:00.771 --> 03:16:01.472]  Stay with us!
[03:16:02.932 --> 03:16:17.205]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[03:16:19.687 --> 03:16:25.813]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[03:16:27.205 --> 03:16:29.746]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[03:16:30.546 --> 03:16:33.947]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[03:16:34.888 --> 03:16:37.069]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[03:16:38.769 --> 03:16:43.971]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[03:16:45.892 --> 03:16:52.514]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[03:16:53.475 --> 03:16:54.455]  It's up to us personally.
[03:16:55.859 --> 03:17:02.712]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[03:17:03.213 --> 03:17:04.536]  I expected that to happen.
[03:17:05.698 --> 03:17:07.041]  This is 21st century warfare.
[03:17:09.013 --> 03:17:19.937]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[03:17:20.657 --> 03:17:22.198]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[03:17:22.878 --> 03:17:34.503]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[03:17:35.083 --> 03:17:37.284]  And we've already come so far together
[03:17:38.308 --> 03:17:47.316]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[03:17:47.897 --> 03:17:53.321]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[03:17:54.442 --> 03:18:02.310]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[03:18:04.557 --> 03:18:12.826]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[03:18:13.346 --> 03:18:14.788]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[03:18:15.789 --> 03:18:18.451]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[03:18:19.252 --> 03:18:21.074]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[03:18:21.114 --> 03:18:26.019]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[03:18:27.100 --> 03:18:37.893]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[03:18:37.933 --> 03:18:41.898]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[03:18:43.303 --> 03:18:43.963]  Our game changing.
[03:18:44.384 --> 03:18:45.884]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[03:18:46.084 --> 03:18:47.225]  The other equation of probiotic.
[03:18:47.285 --> 03:18:50.846]  It's now stronger and a lower price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:51.166 --> 03:18:52.267]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[03:18:52.347 --> 03:18:56.709]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[03:18:57.249 --> 03:19:00.510]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[03:19:00.530 --> 03:19:01.611]  It just does incredible things.
[03:19:02.051 --> 03:19:03.491]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[03:19:03.511 --> 03:19:06.493]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[03:19:06.513 --> 03:19:09.054]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:19:09.574 --> 03:19:14.397]  That's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[03:19:15.017 --> 03:19:26.144]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[03:19:26.604 --> 03:19:33.488]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, the ionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[03:19:33.548 --> 03:19:34.829]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[03:19:35.029 --> 03:19:36.190]  You can swallow it as well.
[03:19:36.610 --> 03:19:42.897]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:19:43.217 --> 03:19:44.579]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:19:44.619 --> 03:19:54.229]  So, thank you all for remembering InfoWarsStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:19:54.529 --> 03:19:57.593]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:20:06.161 --> 03:20:10.642]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.183 --> 03:20:22.724]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:20:23.264 --> 03:20:27.505]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:28.325 --> 03:20:30.445]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex.
[03:20:30.465 --> 03:20:35.286]  It's always great being on InfoWars to get the real news.
[03:20:36.095 --> 03:20:39.816]  And Alex asked me, what's on our radar?
[03:20:40.577 --> 03:20:47.159]  And what's on our radar, as I said, we're very concerned about an explosive situation in the Middle East.
[03:20:48.220 --> 03:20:54.462]  And as you know, Gerald Cilenti's GC's 3Gs, guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[03:20:54.982 --> 03:20:58.464]  It tells the story of what happened on 9-11, and the thing was going to escalate.
[03:20:59.584 --> 03:21:01.885]  I was all set, because everybody was freaking out.
[03:21:02.845 --> 03:21:04.846]  And we could have that kind of incident happen
[03:21:06.814 --> 03:21:11.016]  And worse, in this new age of new millennium warfare.
[03:21:11.876 --> 03:21:20.519]  So, you know, one of the products to consider is that Survival Shield X2.
[03:21:21.219 --> 03:21:22.920]  Survival, you got it?
[03:21:23.560 --> 03:21:25.241]  And that's what this is going to be about.
[03:21:25.781 --> 03:21:27.401]  Survival of the fittest.
[03:21:28.462 --> 03:21:33.523]  Again, we have a new shipment of Survival Shield X2, 25% off.
[03:21:36.678 --> 03:21:46.082]  At BioTrue Selenium, 50% off in BioTrue X2 Combo.
[03:21:46.842 --> 03:22:01.888]  They've received a brand new shipment of this incredibly hard source survival shield, X2, and decided, because you guys and women listening to this, the info was 25% off.
[03:22:05.182 --> 03:22:06.603]  Get your supply today.
[03:22:06.623 --> 03:22:10.605]  As I say, prepare for the worst.
[03:22:11.765 --> 03:22:15.467]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're prepared for it, what'd you lose?
[03:22:16.848 --> 03:22:22.831]  But if the worst happens and you didn't prepare for it, you could lose everything.
[03:22:24.412 --> 03:22:32.696]  And listening to Alex and Roger Stone talking about Facebook, I have to tell you what puzzles me a lot.
[03:22:33.877 --> 03:22:40.061]  Once upon a time, not too long ago, there was a site called MySpace.
[03:22:41.242 --> 03:22:44.344]  And MySpace is up in space.
[03:22:44.624 --> 03:22:45.064]  Gone.
[03:22:45.405 --> 03:22:45.745]  Zip.
[03:22:47.326 --> 03:22:49.367]  The same thing could happen to Facebook.
[03:22:50.308 --> 03:22:59.454]  And what I keep thinking about is how come no one has tried to take them out with a more advanced and lightened system?
[03:23:01.308 --> 03:23:09.030]  And of course Facebook and all the others are censoring, because they're all part of the same group.
[03:23:10.210 --> 03:23:22.812]  You know, when you look at the numbers, you know, I gotta go on to all these websites to see what's going on, and I go on to CNN, and I'm reading, and all of a sudden, BAM!
[03:23:22.832 --> 03:23:29.274]  This full page of Anderson Cooper, his photo keeps popping up.
[03:23:29.334 --> 03:23:30.574]  I don't want to look at this guy.
[03:23:32.025 --> 03:23:35.608]  Now remember, this is a country of what, 320 million people?
[03:23:36.548 --> 03:23:38.189]  How many people watch this guy?
[03:23:41.452 --> 03:23:44.874]  Remember, Alex Jones has 900,000 fans.
[03:23:45.835 --> 03:23:52.719]  This guy does it in just about 900,000 views at prime time, in a country of 320 million people.
[03:23:53.860 --> 03:24:00.605]  So a very, very small group is controlling the information that we're getting.
[03:24:01.468 --> 03:24:05.069]  And when they give it to us, they fill it with propaganda.
[03:24:06.049 --> 03:24:07.729]  And nothing could be clearer than this.
[03:24:10.330 --> 03:24:14.210]  This is from the weekend edition of the Wall Street Journal.
[03:24:14.250 --> 03:24:15.610]  Look at that photo, huh?
[03:24:19.631 --> 03:24:23.932]  Putin is an evil man.
[03:24:25.692 --> 03:24:30.093]  What kind of person would write something like that, being a writer?
[03:24:31.974 --> 03:24:33.735]  I would never write anything like that.
[03:24:34.656 --> 03:24:36.217]  How about Think for Yourself?
[03:24:37.958 --> 03:24:38.819]  So who wrote this?
[03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:41.601]  John McCain.
[03:24:43.002 --> 03:24:47.665]  Or as I've been calling him for many years, John Insane McCain.
[03:24:48.066 --> 03:24:50.607]  I don't want Trump coming to my funeral.
[03:24:51.228 --> 03:24:51.988]  Grow up!
[03:24:52.669 --> 03:24:56.031]  What do you think, somebody, oh I can't wait to go to your funeral?
[03:24:56.412 --> 03:24:58.053]  Probably doesn't want to go anyway.
[03:24:59.654 --> 03:25:01.075]  And you're dead, Jack.
[03:25:01.616 --> 03:25:03.697]  Once you're gone, man, forget it.
[03:25:05.138 --> 03:25:06.960]  I know, you're gonna leave a legacy.
[03:25:07.060 --> 03:25:10.282]  Yeah, a legacy of lies and madness.
[03:25:10.983 --> 03:25:15.266]  Long before Trump said it, I've been saying it for years.
[03:25:15.946 --> 03:25:17.968]  This guy's no war hero.
[03:25:18.689 --> 03:25:21.751]  His plane got shot down bombing innocent people.
[03:25:22.762 --> 03:25:29.444]  A loser of a guy'd be nowhere if granddaddy and daddy weren't admirals in the Navy.
[03:25:29.884 --> 03:25:32.005]  Yeah, you meant when he crashed his planes?
[03:25:34.086 --> 03:25:36.727]  All this guy does is take us to war!
[03:25:38.507 --> 03:25:39.448]  An evil man?
[03:25:39.468 --> 03:25:40.308]  Hey!
[03:25:42.669 --> 03:25:43.129]  Look at that!
[03:25:47.190 --> 03:25:49.251]  Look what Russia did to Libya, huh?
[03:25:50.228 --> 03:25:52.229]  By that lousy Putin.
[03:25:52.549 --> 03:25:54.851]  And they gave him a Nobel Peace Prize.
[03:25:55.131 --> 03:25:56.752]  Oh, that was Obama.
[03:25:57.332 --> 03:25:59.453]  Quote, I'm really good at killing people.
[03:25:59.694 --> 03:26:01.234]  Does that make you evil?
[03:26:01.815 --> 03:26:03.636]  John and Saint McCain?
[03:26:05.537 --> 03:26:08.899]  You war mongering freak of a guy?
[03:26:09.499 --> 03:26:11.921]  Not a war hero, a victim.
[03:26:13.041 --> 03:26:15.042]  Your plane got shot down.
[03:26:15.363 --> 03:26:17.564]  That does not make you a hero.
[03:26:20.276 --> 03:26:23.358]  And now from the Bronx again, the hero is a sandwich.
[03:26:23.699 --> 03:26:30.184]  I would never associate that with you, but anyway... This is the propaganda.
[03:26:30.204 --> 03:26:33.406]  You're talking about Facebook?
[03:26:34.927 --> 03:26:36.268]  It's one after another.
[03:26:38.530 --> 03:26:41.493]  Oh, how about little Georgie Bush?
[03:26:42.193 --> 03:26:45.896]  Hey, go back and watch those videos of him.
[03:26:46.817 --> 03:26:47.557]  Right after 9-11.
[03:26:49.392 --> 03:26:58.234]  You want to see an insincere nothing of a nobody reading his script without an ounce of emotion?
[03:27:00.035 --> 03:27:01.695]  How about that for an evil man?
[03:27:02.856 --> 03:27:05.396]  Oh, you like the Afghan war?
[03:27:06.157 --> 03:27:06.417]  Yeah.
[03:27:09.317 --> 03:27:13.519]  UN finds Afghan attack hit children the hardest.
[03:27:15.799 --> 03:27:15.979]  U.S.
[03:27:16.599 --> 03:27:17.080]  report.
[03:27:17.420 --> 03:27:18.560]  These are just recent days.
[03:27:19.588 --> 03:27:22.810]  Points to setbacks in Afghanistan.
[03:27:25.111 --> 03:27:28.533]  A government to name only in an Afghan city.
[03:27:31.255 --> 03:27:36.178]  15 die in Afghan attacks as Taliban makes gains.
[03:27:36.238 --> 03:27:36.518]  Huh?
[03:27:37.298 --> 03:27:38.079]  An evil man?
[03:27:38.599 --> 03:27:39.139]  Wait a minute.
[03:27:39.720 --> 03:27:47.044]  In one week, Taliban kills about 100 Afghan soldiers and police officers.
[03:27:47.862 --> 03:27:53.005]  John and Shane McCain and all the other freaks that took us to war.
[03:27:53.025 --> 03:27:55.007]  Taliban didn't do anything to us.
[03:27:55.467 --> 03:27:58.729]  Oh wait a minute, weren't those Saudis allegedly on the plane?
[03:27:59.509 --> 03:28:04.953]  Oh yeah, the clown prince was here and he rolled out the red carpet and saluted them.
[03:28:05.894 --> 03:28:07.174]  Taliban didn't do anything.
[03:28:07.194 --> 03:28:10.296]  They were hiding Bin Laden, I says.
[03:28:10.316 --> 03:28:12.618]  You want to talk about evil men?
[03:28:13.697 --> 03:28:15.239]  There's a whole long list of them.
[03:28:15.699 --> 03:28:17.521]  I forgot Slick Willie Clinton.
[03:28:17.761 --> 03:28:18.002]  Yep.
[03:28:18.482 --> 03:28:26.571]  Every time that cat would get in trouble, boom, bombs away over Iraq.
[03:28:26.731 --> 03:28:28.332]  But people forget that.
[03:28:28.873 --> 03:28:30.755]  Killed over 500,000 people.
[03:28:32.217 --> 03:28:35.380]  Madeleine Albright said, eh, it was worth the price of sanction.
[03:28:38.558 --> 03:28:39.879]  And that's the way it is.
[03:28:40.339 --> 03:28:42.741]  We'll be back in a little bit for a lot more.
[03:28:43.242 --> 03:28:44.402]  Prepare for the future.
[03:28:54.010 --> 03:29:04.478]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[03:29:05.389 --> 03:29:07.272]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:29:07.312 --> 03:29:16.710]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:29:17.507 --> 03:29:24.051]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:29:24.271 --> 03:29:26.432]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:29:26.532 --> 03:29:26.912]  Thank you.
[03:29:27.593 --> 03:29:30.054]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:29:30.074 --> 03:29:33.836]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[03:29:34.397 --> 03:29:37.378]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:29:37.418 --> 03:29:38.399]  They are quality.
[03:29:38.739 --> 03:29:40.000]  I can't wait to get some more.
[03:29:40.480 --> 03:29:43.222]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:29:43.362 --> 03:29:43.922]  Absolutely.
[03:29:44.402 --> 03:29:57.331]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:30:06.107 --> 03:30:17.957]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[03:30:18.598 --> 03:30:27.925]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[03:30:28.146 --> 03:30:32.950]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products,
[03:30:33.450 --> 03:30:38.513]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads.
[03:30:38.533 --> 03:30:42.755]  The cobwebs go away and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[03:30:43.596 --> 03:30:48.319]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up and the nutrition to wake them up.
[03:30:48.339 --> 03:30:49.879]  I mean, the brain is a physical organ.
[03:30:50.480 --> 03:30:56.763]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[03:30:56.823 --> 03:30:57.604]  Here's my problem.
[03:30:58.124 --> 03:31:06.548]  When I do take the bodies and the extuate things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[03:31:06.888 --> 03:31:08.088]  Now most people aren't... I have the same issue.
[03:31:08.368 --> 03:31:08.549]  Yeah.
[03:31:09.169 --> 03:31:12.010]  Because then you're just like, ahh!
[03:31:12.250 --> 03:31:13.751]  But that's better than being in a coma.
[03:31:14.751 --> 03:31:19.753]  And they admit neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[03:31:20.074 --> 03:31:22.215]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[03:31:22.255 --> 03:31:25.336]  And I'm glad you mentioned that, because bodies have just come back in.
[03:31:25.516 --> 03:31:29.038]  It's 25% off, and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[03:31:29.338 --> 03:31:30.899]  We went out with the top labs.
[03:31:30.939 --> 03:31:33.280]  We want the strongest concentrate.
[03:31:34.040 --> 03:31:38.324]  Of it out there, and Mike, you've tested the products, you've studied the products, you've looked at the products.
[03:31:38.644 --> 03:31:43.528]  You were saying that you really like bodies and do think it's a top of the line turmeric product, and there's so much research on turmeric.
[03:31:44.268 --> 03:31:45.089]  It's just incredible.
[03:31:45.449 --> 03:31:54.196]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[03:31:54.717 --> 03:31:55.257]  This is key.
[03:31:55.277 --> 03:31:59.180]  You know, inflammation is a systemic problem, and you have inflammation of the brain.
[03:31:59.241 --> 03:32:00.782]  They call that something down the road.
[03:32:00.822 --> 03:32:03.264]  I can't use disease names here because of FDA regulations.
[03:32:03.644 --> 03:32:05.265]  You have inflammation of the cells.
[03:32:05.306 --> 03:32:06.807]  They call that something else down the road.
[03:32:06.827 --> 03:32:12.251]  By the way, I've had Dr. Blaylock and other top brain surgeons on and they say it's inflammation in the brain.
[03:32:12.612 --> 03:32:15.294]  That's why you've got Alzheimer's at age 30 now.
[03:32:15.414 --> 03:32:16.115]  That's exactly right.
[03:32:16.475 --> 03:32:22.080]  Now your product is an extract and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[03:32:22.320 --> 03:32:26.784]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[03:32:27.384 --> 03:32:30.567]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[03:32:30.928 --> 03:32:36.353]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[03:32:36.393 --> 03:32:38.035]  Well, that's another reason.
[03:32:38.115 --> 03:32:45.082]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that, they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals test if you don't.
[03:32:45.242 --> 03:32:45.642]  Exactly.
[03:32:45.782 --> 03:32:52.665]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[03:32:52.985 --> 03:32:57.507]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[03:33:06.171 --> 03:33:08.772]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.181 --> 03:33:35.405]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:35.485 --> 03:33:37.927]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:41.309 --> 03:33:43.130]  That's almost Alex Jones.
[03:33:44.191 --> 03:33:46.472]  Anyway, it's me, Gerald Cilenti.
[03:33:47.173 --> 03:33:58.660]  Great being on InfoWars and having this opportunity to put out information that will help you plan ahead, because that's what we do in trend forecasting.
[03:33:59.215 --> 03:34:01.177]  Current events form future trends.
[03:34:02.137 --> 03:34:06.841]  And I was talking about what's going on in the Middle East and the concerns that we have that are growing.
[03:34:07.922 --> 03:34:11.205]  And again, the nation cannot take a spike in oil prices.
[03:34:12.686 --> 03:34:13.727]  You go back to 2007.
[03:34:16.409 --> 03:34:17.550]  What happened after that?
[03:34:17.690 --> 03:34:18.791]  The panic of 08.
[03:34:19.752 --> 03:34:21.193]  What were gasoline prices?
[03:34:21.673 --> 03:34:24.336]  Well, a barrel of oil was selling around 150 bucks.
[03:34:24.356 --> 03:34:24.516]  Go back!
[03:34:27.714 --> 03:34:29.075]  To the dot-com bust.
[03:34:30.695 --> 03:34:31.175]  Oh, yeah.
[03:34:32.196 --> 03:34:34.937]  Oil prices were spiking just before the bust.
[03:34:37.237 --> 03:34:39.678]  Keep going back and you can see the trend.
[03:34:41.419 --> 03:34:49.622]  Tracking trends is a way of seeing where we are and how we got here to see where we're going.
[03:34:50.582 --> 03:34:52.903]  If oil prices start to spike,
[03:34:54.528 --> 03:34:57.650]  And now Brent Crude is approaching that $80 mark.
[03:34:59.071 --> 03:35:07.175]  We are forecasting if oil hits $100 a barrel, kiss the economy goodbye.
[03:35:08.636 --> 03:35:12.218]  And those equity markets, bye-bye.
[03:35:13.879 --> 03:35:15.920]  Guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[03:35:16.100 --> 03:35:16.920]  On to the gold.
[03:35:18.641 --> 03:35:21.623]  Story just came out showing
[03:35:22.887 --> 03:35:35.397]  Gold miners hit by fears, again all things are connected in our global nomic system, of rising oil prices.
[03:35:36.658 --> 03:35:40.141]  It's costing them more to get it out of the ground.
[03:35:41.442 --> 03:35:47.607]  So now we have oil at around, again, approaching that $80 a barrel mark.
[03:35:48.508 --> 03:35:50.369]  And we got gold flirting around the $1,300 mark.
[03:35:52.412 --> 03:36:08.665]  The downside risk of gold, as we see it, as forecasters, we don't sell gold, we don't give financial advice, we're trend forecasters, and the Trends Journal motto, as you know, is think for yourself.
[03:36:09.526 --> 03:36:19.314]  We see a $100 downside, because as the price keeps going up to pull it out of the ground, they're not going to pull it out of the ground and lose money.
[03:36:21.548 --> 03:36:27.210]  So we would suggest that the downside risk is $100 max.
[03:36:29.071 --> 03:36:33.932]  Again, you've heard me say this before, gold has to break over the $1,385 an ounce mark.
[03:36:33.952 --> 03:36:36.133]  When it breaks over that, the next one's $1,450.
[03:36:37.113 --> 03:36:38.334]  When it breaks past the $1,450, boom!
[03:36:38.354 --> 03:36:38.874]  A Bitcoin bounce.
[03:36:49.252 --> 03:36:53.314]  Meaning that from very low to very high, over 2,000.
[03:36:53.874 --> 03:37:02.598]  And with the destabilization happening now, again, think for yourself.
[03:37:03.899 --> 03:37:06.960]  But for me, it's a golden game.
[03:37:08.581 --> 03:37:15.444]  To put it into perspective, they just had an election over there in Iraq.
[03:37:16.638 --> 03:37:18.940]  Yeah, you remember that war based on lies.
[03:37:19.760 --> 03:37:25.985]  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction in ties to al-Qaeda.
[03:37:28.627 --> 03:37:31.189]  And again, you know, I put my money where my heart is.
[03:37:31.289 --> 03:37:32.750]  I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:37:34.151 --> 03:37:36.893]  So when I talk about peace, they're not empty words.
[03:37:40.396 --> 03:37:41.837]  A war based on lies.
[03:37:41.897 --> 03:37:43.558]  How about that evil Putin, huh?
[03:37:44.419 --> 03:37:46.040]  How about Dick Cheney?
[03:37:47.099 --> 03:37:52.362]  It ought to be proper penis chaining, because I don't want to get, you know, call him a dick.
[03:37:53.222 --> 03:37:54.103]  And that's really it.
[03:37:54.723 --> 03:37:55.743]  So I got to be proper.
[03:37:56.644 --> 03:37:57.844]  The lies from him.
[03:37:57.864 --> 03:38:02.707]  You know, people learn to hate Iran.
[03:38:02.727 --> 03:38:03.827]  They don't know their history.
[03:38:06.069 --> 03:38:14.653]  Go back not even too long ago, 10 years before they started the Iraq War, George Bush did, the father of the first Iraq War.
[03:38:16.587 --> 03:38:28.834]  Donald Rumsfeld, a little, little nothing boy, little clown of a jerk, giving Saddam Hussein those golden spurs to launch a war against Iran in 1980.
[03:38:29.394 --> 03:38:30.735]  People don't know that one.
[03:38:30.755 --> 03:38:33.096]  Yeah, I wonder why they don't like Americans.
[03:38:33.136 --> 03:38:33.876]  Can't figure it out.
[03:38:33.896 --> 03:38:40.900]  Oh, it couldn't be the 1953 overthrow of Mosaddegh, the democratically elected government.
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:43.722]  By the way, the reports came out last year
[03:38:44.355 --> 03:38:48.297]  They finally released him from the CIA, but it never made the U.S.
[03:38:48.357 --> 03:39:04.325]  News on how Winston Churchill and the MI6 persuaded the United States and the CIA to foster the overthrow of Mosaddegh and bring in the Shah, the dictator.
[03:39:05.326 --> 03:39:13.270]  But going back to gold and where we are with oil prices, the way it's destabilizing now
[03:39:16.567 --> 03:39:21.250]  And seeing what's going on, it looks like they're taking us to war.
[03:39:22.991 --> 03:39:31.436]  And going back to the Iraq War that was based on lies, top populist cleric who fought U.S.
[03:39:31.516 --> 03:39:35.719]  troops is winning Iraq's election.
[03:39:38.427 --> 03:39:46.972]  The numbers are still coming in after polls closed over the weekend in Iraq's first election since defeating the Islamic State last year.
[03:39:48.653 --> 03:40:06.703]  And they're pointing to a shock win for a firebrand Iraqi cleric who wasn't even running for prime minister, along with his coalition allies, the Iraqi Communist Party.
[03:40:11.986 --> 03:40:18.751]  All right, there's no victory in these wars, and they're just heating up, one after another.
[03:40:18.771 --> 03:40:31.942]  I mentioned before, talking to Alex, about what's going on in Saudi Arabia, how they invaded the sovereign nation of Yemen, who did nothing to them.
[03:40:33.003 --> 03:40:38.147]  They want to put back the other dictator that was there, before the other dictator
[03:40:38.703 --> 03:40:40.765]  Before him, Salah was thrown out.
[03:40:40.845 --> 03:40:42.346]  And then Hadi was the next guy.
[03:40:42.366 --> 03:40:43.767]  They didn't even know how to vote.
[03:40:44.387 --> 03:40:46.649]  United States and Saudi Arabia put him in there.
[03:40:46.669 --> 03:40:48.410]  The Houthis didn't want him there.
[03:40:48.430 --> 03:40:54.815]  And the Houthis, by the way, had been only in Iran, excuse me, in Yemen for about a thousand years.
[03:40:55.536 --> 03:40:56.897]  They broke up the joint in the 1990s.
[03:40:56.977 --> 03:40:59.058]  It used to be two countries.
[03:40:59.599 --> 03:41:05.763]  And the Houthis are from one section, and the others are from, so it was a split country that they unified.
[03:41:05.823 --> 03:41:06.364]  It didn't work.
[03:41:07.853 --> 03:41:11.275]  So now we have Saudi Arabia destroying this country.
[03:41:13.296 --> 03:41:17.978]  Poorest nation in the Middle East.
[03:41:18.519 --> 03:41:22.181]  The World Health Organization calls it the greatest health crisis in the world.
[03:41:22.901 --> 03:41:23.381]  Headline.
[03:41:23.982 --> 03:41:35.508]  Saudi forces arrive on Socotra as Yemen slams United Arab Emirates colonization of Ireland.
[03:41:37.907 --> 03:41:42.809]  Saudi Arabia has announced Sunday that they are deploying troops to the Yemeni island.
[03:41:46.631 --> 03:42:01.418]  Now remember, the United Arab Emirates was part of this coalition that was going to overthrow the Yemen government of the Houthis, or the Houthis trying to overthrow the other government.
[03:42:01.739 --> 03:42:04.200]  But anyway, who can figure it out?
[03:42:04.840 --> 03:42:06.141]  And we're involved in this?
[03:42:08.334 --> 03:42:12.836]  And now they're reporting that United States troops are in Yemen as well.
[03:42:15.337 --> 03:42:18.479]  After they were pushed out back around 2013, 2014.
[03:42:20.400 --> 03:42:26.723]  So again, none of these wars, there's no victories to show for them.
[03:42:28.043 --> 03:42:28.984]  Only horror.
[03:42:30.305 --> 03:42:32.686]  And it's becoming more horrible.
[03:42:32.706 --> 03:42:37.228]  And that's why we're suggesting consider
[03:42:38.826 --> 03:42:41.692]  Doing what you wish, but be prepared.
[03:42:43.696 --> 03:42:44.598]  We'll be back in a minute.
[03:43:02.526 --> 03:43:03.948]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:43:42.902 --> 03:43:44.863]  And this part is most important.

[03:43:51.747 --> 03:43:52.810]  That means it's clean.
[03:43:53.190 --> 03:43:54.192]  That means it's pure.
[03:43:54.333 --> 03:43:57.138]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[03:43:57.238 --> 03:43:59.824]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:44:08.555 --> 03:44:11.856]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:44:12.716 --> 03:44:20.097]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:44:20.758 --> 03:44:27.059]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[03:44:27.899 --> 03:44:33.142]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:44:33.762 --> 03:44:45.889]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[03:44:46.569 --> 03:44:52.095]  Macaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[03:44:52.855 --> 03:44:56.379]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.

[03:45:02.364 --> 03:45:24.050]  If you like the expanded coverage at InfoWars, if you're enjoying the Real News with David Knight in the mornings, the iconic Alex Jones Show midday, and of course the War Room with my colleague Owen Schroyer, please remember that we are completely listener and viewer supported here at InfoWars, and we face the greatest challenge we have ever faced.
[03:45:25.057 --> 03:45:40.407]  If you're a regular listener, you know about the spate of lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars, every one of them baseless, every one of them meritless, every one of them bogus, but designed to generate negative headlines and enormous legal bills.
[03:45:40.887 --> 03:45:50.834]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to remove us from the Internet, remove us from YouTube, from Facebook, from Google, and so on.
[03:45:51.454 --> 03:45:54.575]  The costs are astronomical and they're only rising.
[03:45:54.675 --> 03:45:54.955]  Why?
[03:45:55.235 --> 03:45:56.656]  Because Alex Jones is a fighter.
[03:45:57.036 --> 03:46:00.477]  And he will fight every one of these lawsuits with truth.
[03:46:01.037 --> 03:46:02.798]  Because the truth in the end will win.
[03:46:02.818 --> 03:46:04.978]  But that doesn't mean that it isn't expensive.
[03:46:05.278 --> 03:46:09.940]  So we need you to go to the InfoWars store now and look at some of our terrific products.
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:19.603]  Not only do we have our cutting-edge nutraceuticals where Alex Jones and his team of scientists take the very best of ancient Chinese medicine.
[03:46:20.143 --> 03:46:27.790]  In practice for centuries, combining it with cutting-edge new nutraceuticals to bring you formulas that are really effective.
[03:46:28.390 --> 03:46:31.273]  Everything that they put forward has been rigorously tested.
[03:46:31.753 --> 03:46:37.978]  And if you don't believe it, go to the testimonials, where you have literally thousands, in some cases, of satisfied customers.
[03:46:38.259 --> 03:46:40.540]  When you go to the site, you're not only helping yourself.
[03:46:40.961 --> 03:46:42.642]  As Alex Jones liked to say, it's a 360-degree win.
[03:46:45.044 --> 03:46:51.747]  You win, and we win, because Alex Jones pumps the money back into M4's to pay for our expanded coverage here.
[03:46:52.027 --> 03:47:01.670]  So please folks, do us a favor, do yourself a favor, stand up for the First Amendment, kick George Soros right in the derriere, go to the website now.
[03:47:06.212 --> 03:47:08.853]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.022 --> 03:47:27.944]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:28.405 --> 03:47:30.766]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:47:34.828 --> 03:47:42.773]  So again, tracking trends is an understanding of where we are, how we got here, and where we're going.
[03:47:43.654 --> 03:47:48.957]  And before I was talking about gas, and what it's going to do to the economy.
[03:47:50.137 --> 03:47:52.419]  Again, current events form future trends.
[03:47:53.558 --> 03:47:55.099]  It's today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:47:55.899 --> 03:48:10.645]  Morgan Stanley estimates that if gas averages $2.96 this year, it would take an annualized $38 billion from spending elsewhere.
[03:48:12.346 --> 03:48:13.767]  That means retail.
[03:48:14.967 --> 03:48:17.388]  So again, be prepared.
[03:48:18.469 --> 03:48:21.070]  But, you know, think for yourself and think about this.
[03:48:23.473 --> 03:48:39.800]  InfoWars is introducing DNA Force Plus for InfoWars Life and 50% off the introductory price of $74.95.
[03:48:40.700 --> 03:48:52.845]  After months of waiting, InfoWars is finally transforming CellForce into what it was meant to be, DNA Force Plus.
[03:48:54.079 --> 03:49:15.833]  Using the same great formula to build up one of the most popular products ever, DNA Force Plus is the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[03:49:17.575 --> 03:49:18.095]  All right?
[03:49:19.296 --> 03:49:22.778]  The daily bombardment of toxins.
[03:49:23.880 --> 03:49:31.402]  The ones you eat, the ones you breathe, the ones you drink, and also the ones you hear, and the ones you see.
[03:49:32.182 --> 03:49:41.725]  Because I've been at this game a long time, hanging around this planet, and I've never seen a freak show like the one going on.
[03:49:42.585 --> 03:49:45.386]  And the media is a disgusting joke.
[03:49:46.866 --> 03:49:48.886]  How can anybody watch this stuff?
[03:49:48.926 --> 03:49:50.727]  And the reality is they're not.
[03:49:52.190 --> 03:49:55.673]  Again, you have a country of 320 million people.
[03:49:56.854 --> 03:49:57.554]  And what do you got?
[03:49:57.654 --> 03:49:58.475]  Morning Joe.
[03:49:58.535 --> 03:50:00.396]  I hear about this guy all the time.
[03:50:00.416 --> 03:50:06.441]  And then... Brzezinski.
[03:50:07.302 --> 03:50:07.762]  Another one.
[03:50:07.802 --> 03:50:10.724]  Should be nowhere, for old man wasn't the murderer Brzezinski.
[03:50:11.165 --> 03:50:12.305]  Forgot that guy, huh?
[03:50:12.926 --> 03:50:13.666]  Under Carter.
[03:50:15.608 --> 03:50:17.990]  Yeah, he makes Bolton look like they're brothers.
[03:50:20.020 --> 03:50:22.462]  Boy, they got a million people listening?
[03:50:24.304 --> 03:50:26.585]  So toxins hit you in a lot of ways.
[03:50:27.726 --> 03:50:36.053]  And as I said, we're telling our subscribers, advising, I should say, to prepare.
[03:50:37.214 --> 03:50:38.795]  Don't wait until it happens.
[03:50:38.855 --> 03:50:39.736]  It's too late.
[03:50:41.057 --> 03:50:45.941]  And InfoWars offers a lot of products for your survival.
[03:50:47.518 --> 03:50:53.502]  And now, as before, it will be survival of the fittest.
[03:50:55.744 --> 03:50:57.365]  And on to some other news.
[03:51:00.868 --> 03:51:08.773]  One of my solutions for a better life is what I call blockchain democracy.
[03:51:10.295 --> 03:51:16.299]  When Alex was talking to Roger Stone before, he made a comment about, you know, what is
[03:51:16.960 --> 03:51:19.481]  Congress stupid or words to that effect?
[03:51:20.141 --> 03:51:21.161]  How come they don't do anything?
[03:51:21.241 --> 03:51:22.062]  Were they stupid?
[03:51:22.122 --> 03:51:23.282]  Of course they're stupid!
[03:51:25.082 --> 03:51:27.083]  Why can't we call a spade a spade?
[03:51:28.544 --> 03:51:29.524]  Mitch McConnell?
[03:51:32.725 --> 03:51:33.965]  Lindsey Graham?
[03:51:36.426 --> 03:51:38.607]  Diane not so Feinstein?
[03:51:40.087 --> 03:51:41.547]  Little Chuckie Schumer?
[03:51:44.528 --> 03:51:46.569]  Nancy out of her mind Pelosi?
[03:51:49.926 --> 03:51:51.347]  Is Congress stupid?
[03:51:52.267 --> 03:51:55.468]  They're ignorant psychopaths and sociopaths.
[03:51:55.828 --> 03:51:57.729]  They don't represent me.
[03:51:57.749 --> 03:52:02.071]  The little Andrew Cuomo, the arrogant governor, doesn't represent me.
[03:52:02.111 --> 03:52:04.612]  The mayor of Kingston doesn't represent me.
[03:52:05.813 --> 03:52:07.153]  No one represents me.
[03:52:07.173 --> 03:52:08.594]  I represent myself.
[03:52:10.255 --> 03:52:12.475]  I live in the United States of America.
[03:52:12.495 --> 03:52:16.017]  We're bombing countries all the time to bring them freedom and democracy.
[03:52:16.886 --> 03:52:21.168]  Oh, I forgot about that story that's out of the news that happened Friday.
[03:52:21.529 --> 03:52:22.569]  We can go Friday.
[03:52:24.190 --> 03:52:27.892]  The NSA, what?
[03:52:27.912 --> 03:52:33.035]  550 million taps into our telephones and messaging systems?
[03:52:34.716 --> 03:52:35.977]  Who makes this stuff up?
[03:52:37.017 --> 03:52:37.958]  So here's the trend.
[03:52:38.638 --> 03:52:40.159]  Blockchain democracy.
[03:52:41.829 --> 03:52:42.650]  Two stories.
[03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:44.691]  Again, current events form future trends.
[03:52:44.731 --> 03:52:49.035]  To put this into perspective, when you make that transaction, it's blocked.
[03:52:49.835 --> 03:52:50.736]  Blocked chain.
[03:52:52.597 --> 03:52:55.880]  Here's how blockchain may replace IDs in the future.
[03:52:58.462 --> 03:53:08.970]  So looking at over 1 billion people worldwide don't have any form of identification, making it difficult to access many of the social institutions the developed world takes for granted.
[03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:10.511]  So they're looking
[03:53:11.556 --> 03:53:16.419]  To make blockchain the underpinnings of digital identity.
[03:53:17.740 --> 03:53:19.761]  And this is going to the World Food Program.
[03:53:21.302 --> 03:53:34.629]  Two, HSBC trade finance transaction opens door for blockchain in nine trillion dollar market.
[03:53:34.930 --> 03:53:37.571]  Again, current events form future trends.
[03:53:37.831 --> 03:53:38.832]  This is today's.
[03:53:41.098 --> 03:53:43.399]  By the way, see the way I underline these stories?
[03:53:43.499 --> 03:53:47.880]  I underline the salient points of the story, so it helps me remember them.
[03:53:49.581 --> 03:53:52.302]  I'm bringing this back to blockchain democracy.
[03:53:53.862 --> 03:53:55.643]  What are we going to the polls for?
[03:53:57.063 --> 03:53:59.664]  You can bank online, you can vote online.
[03:54:02.185 --> 03:54:03.585]  You got a tax plan?
[03:54:04.666 --> 03:54:05.606]  We'll vote on it.
[03:54:06.966 --> 03:54:08.207]  You want to go to war?
[03:54:09.438 --> 03:54:10.559]  We'll vote on it.
[03:54:11.099 --> 03:54:13.020]  Oh, the people are too stupid.
[03:54:13.541 --> 03:54:14.041]  Yeah?
[03:54:14.861 --> 03:54:16.142]  Dumber than Schumer?
[03:54:17.903 --> 03:54:19.904]  More moronic than Graham?
[03:54:21.665 --> 03:54:23.867]  Out of a mind more than Pelosi?
[03:54:25.588 --> 03:54:27.469]  Let us determine our future.
[03:54:27.489 --> 03:54:30.751]  Hey, you see they're legalizing gambling now?
[03:54:31.411 --> 03:54:32.652]  Supreme Court said so.
[03:54:34.424 --> 03:54:36.644]  Oh yeah, like marijuana, right?
[03:54:37.145 --> 03:54:42.406]  Throw you in jail, bust you for that, but people dying on opiates, hey, but they come from the drug companies.
[03:54:42.866 --> 03:54:44.366]  Let the people vote!
[03:54:44.986 --> 03:54:55.268]  The richest country in the world, where every guy got a gun, and they're not blowing people's brains out, is Switzerland.
[03:54:57.508 --> 03:55:00.909]  More dough, more guns than anybody, per capita.
[03:55:04.161 --> 03:55:07.402]  They vote on major issues.
[03:55:07.462 --> 03:55:09.942]  You don't know who the president of Switzerland is.
[03:55:12.703 --> 03:55:13.943]  Let the people vote.
[03:55:14.884 --> 03:55:16.244]  Let us decide.
[03:55:17.184 --> 03:55:26.606]  And you don't have to wait in line in these stupid polling places with a bunch of stupid, arrogant people, where I'm important to stay.
[03:55:27.787 --> 03:55:30.107]  Man, blockchain, it's blocked.
[03:55:30.927 --> 03:55:33.128]  And the system will be entirely open.
[03:55:33.888 --> 03:55:34.688]  For review.
[03:55:35.689 --> 03:55:37.289]  So you know it's not being hacked.
[03:55:39.050 --> 03:55:41.991]  Blockchain democracy is my future.
[03:55:43.092 --> 03:55:45.412]  And you know my motto is think for yourself.
[03:55:46.753 --> 03:55:49.594]  People running the show don't represent me.
[03:55:50.874 --> 03:56:00.098]  They represent what adults call bribes and payoffs, and the prostitute media calls campaign contributions.
[03:56:00.938 --> 03:56:02.579]  Those are the people they represent.
[03:56:03.260 --> 03:56:05.161]  Blockchain democracy.
[03:56:07.181 --> 03:56:08.581]  It's the real deal.
[03:56:09.702 --> 03:56:11.742]  Good or bad, we'll decide.
[03:56:12.563 --> 03:56:29.287]  I was not put on this earth to take someone who does something, by definition, a politician, in a manipulative and devious way to gain advancement within an organization to represent me.
[03:56:30.007 --> 03:56:33.148]  I don't know about you, but that's the way I feel about it.
[03:56:34.611 --> 03:56:40.834]  So, in wrapping up, remember, we're looking for a lot of problems over there.
[03:56:41.734 --> 03:56:43.095]  But you know what China's doing?
[03:56:43.115 --> 03:56:45.136]  They're taking advantage of it.
[03:56:45.996 --> 03:56:50.358]  The business of China is to exploit business at any level in any way possible.
[03:56:51.799 --> 03:56:52.719]  You got it right here.
[03:56:55.160 --> 03:56:58.542]  China poised to cash in on Europe's lost business.
[03:57:03.152 --> 03:57:10.034]  Entrepreneurs' Paradise, over 21 million new companies registered in China over four years.
[03:57:11.054 --> 03:57:15.175]  So the business of China, like them or not, it's business anyway they do it.
[03:57:16.275 --> 03:57:19.676]  The business of America has become war.
[03:57:20.936 --> 03:57:22.237]  It's about guns and butter.
[03:57:23.937 --> 03:57:31.139]  So again, put your money where your mind is, support InfoWars, and we'll see you soon.
[03:57:32.079 --> 03:57:32.929]  Thanks for tuning in.

[03:57:55.780 --> 03:58:00.922]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[03:58:01.582 --> 03:58:04.523]  This is the essence of InfoWars.

[03:58:56.438 --> 03:58:57.739]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:58:58.240 --> 03:58:59.781]  We have found an extraordinary new
