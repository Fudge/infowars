[00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:12.363]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:21.227]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.109]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:31.203]  We knew that a global tyranny was coming.
[00:00:31.523 --> 00:00:34.927]  An anti-human, satanic, Mark of the Beast world government system.
[00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:41.113]  But now in 2018, I can officially tell you, it is emerging.
[00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:43.696]  It's here and attempting to completely take over.
[00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:45.858]  Prophecy is fulfilled.
[00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:59.188]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have news here where they're taking people, six-year-old children, because the school says the child wants to be transgendered, and then they begin sterilization with chemicals, and then they castrate them.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.321]  It's all here.
[00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.244]  Google's not going to let you say he or she when you type in now.
[00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:06.004]  They're removing it.
[00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:08.466]  The world government's being announced.
[00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:15.452]  The UN's been caught running giant child kidnapping rings and currently is involved and it's confirmed in the huge invasion taking place.
[00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:17.313]  Our reporters are on the ground.
[00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:18.994]  We've got intel from the Border Patrol.
[00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:22.597]  They're getting ready to try to go back over the border in the next two days.
[00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:23.658]  Our reporters will be there.
[00:01:23.698 --> 00:01:24.399]  It's all coming up.
[00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:29.403]  But first, a report from our crew on the ground on the California
[00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:30.987]  Mexico border.
[00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:34.209]  It is Monday night, November 26, 2018.
[00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.772]  We're standing on the southern border of the United States.
[00:01:39.652 --> 00:01:41.873]  Right behind me is San Ysidro Port of Entry.
[00:01:43.094 --> 00:01:45.235]  Just yesterday, hundreds of non-U.S.
[00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:48.817]  citizens attempted to illegally cross into the border right here.
[00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:57.142]  Our sources in Mexico tell us that this was just a test for a much larger attack, which is what it certainly seems to be.
[00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:10.595]  The United Nations has been responsible for funding and organizing this unprecedented migrant invasion against sovereign nations for a few years now.
[00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:21.441]  They are trying to set a precedent in international law, challenging the sovereign right of nations to secure and regulate their own borders.
[00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:28.025]  For a nation without borders has no sovereignty and is not a nation anymore.
[00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:32.911]  Which is precisely the goal of this malevolent globalist utopia.
[00:02:34.313 --> 00:02:38.896]  Smash us all together violently and claim the spoils when the dust settles.
[00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.221]  The United Nations call it replacement migration.
[00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:50.726]  And act as if they have some sort of legal authority over the lives of all human beings.
[00:02:52.128 --> 00:02:54.510]  But it is an illegal and hostile invasion.
[00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.991]  Pure and simple.
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.241]  This invasion, however, is very unique.
[00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:03.902]  Border defenses are not threatened with invading armies.
[00:03:04.622 --> 00:03:09.484]  Rather, they are threatened with so-called civilians claiming to seek a better life.
[00:03:11.484 --> 00:03:16.486]  The nation's legal citizens are threatened with the shame of being called racist or xenophobic.
[00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:29.993]  And so the only nations who have successfully managed to defend their borders from this invasion are those who maintain a strong sense of individualism, culture, and national identity.
[00:03:31.174 --> 00:03:39.583]  But countries such as Germany, Sweden, France, and the UK have so far failed this test of individual strength.
[00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:49.872]  These once great nations are falling at the threat of shame being cast by the United Nations and their NGO proxies.
[00:03:52.173 --> 00:03:57.837]  If they can break through the borders, then a precedent is set and the floodgates are open.
[00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.640]  And now it is happening in the United States.
[00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:08.803]  The fact that the United Nations has finally begun their invasion on the U.S.
[00:04:08.884 --> 00:04:10.705]  border is no surprise.
[00:04:11.602 --> 00:04:12.923]  Many of us saw this coming.
[00:04:14.284 --> 00:04:28.636]  The surprise and great disappointment is seeing how many Americans seem willing to sacrifice their freedom so they can virtue signal to the rest of us and protect their fragile egos from being labeled racist or xenophobic.
[00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:33.440]  But if you cannot secure your home, then you have no home.
[00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.002]  And you have no nation.
[00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.824]  And this is precisely what the globalists want.
[00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:39.606]  Order out of chaos.
[00:04:40.672 --> 00:04:41.633]  History is being made.
[00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:44.414]  This is Greg Reese for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:11.837]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[00:05:13.558 --> 00:05:16.579]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.700]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:23.203]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[00:05:23.663 --> 00:05:31.007]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:33.568]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.204]  We have seen what they want to do.
[00:05:39.224 --> 00:05:42.404]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[00:05:42.644 --> 00:05:53.387]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[00:05:55.447 --> 00:05:58.648]  Never miss your show, any day.
[00:05:59.148 --> 00:05:59.689]  I mean, what?
[00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.609]  I mean, never!
[00:06:11.874 --> 00:06:16.837]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.382 --> 00:06:28.265]  The United States of America is under military attack.
[00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:37.951]  Europe has been captured by the globalists and is being broken up and then swallowed into a larger world government system.
[00:06:39.352 --> 00:06:40.013]  The family
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.142]  And any form of independence is being savagely destroyed.
[00:06:48.683 --> 00:07:09.370]  Giant third-world populations, already exploited by the global crime cartel, are being dumbed down, weaponized, and then marched in to the West to bankrupt our social safety net and to siphon the money off to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, the Soros Group, and others that administer it.
[00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:17.964]  Once the West is collapsed, there will be nothing but a giant mass of poor people worldwide, controlled by globalist technocrats.
[00:07:21.886 --> 00:07:28.290]  Their most vicious assault, and their most naked assault, is against children.
[00:07:30.372 --> 00:07:31.933]  Children who are defenseless.
[00:07:33.114 --> 00:07:35.055]  Children who can be easily brainwashed.
[00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.077]  Children who can be easily screwed up,
[00:07:39.653 --> 00:07:58.917]  When authority figures that they genetically are predisposed to listen to carry out incredibly vicious programs to destabilize them.
[00:08:03.117 --> 00:08:06.418]  Now our reporters are on the ground
[00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:10.495]  In Tijuana, Mexico.
[00:08:12.477 --> 00:08:17.321]  And we've got guides in law enforcement.
[00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:18.382]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:08:20.984 --> 00:08:23.606]  They're going to be joining us for their first live report.
[00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:28.430]  Greg Reese and others coming up in the third hour.
[00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:36.577]  I remember just two weeks ago, they were telling you that this
[00:08:38.553 --> 00:08:43.375]  Immigrant, illegal alien, invasion did not exist.
[00:08:44.595 --> 00:08:55.999]  You supposedly don't have a memory to remember that it does and did exist, that they're bald-faced lying to you when Jim Acosta told Trump there is no caravan.
[00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:57.759]  Trump said, yes, they're there.
[00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:58.880]  They're in Central Mexico.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.680]  Are you saying they're actors?
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.681]  Are you saying it doesn't exist?
[00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:05.442]  And Acosta said, yes, I'm saying it doesn't exist.
[00:09:08.766 --> 00:09:12.028]  That is a form of mind control called gas lighting.
[00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:28.837]  We have confirmed from the military, and ICE, and from the Mexican side, from the very best sources out there, that there is about to be a massive attack in two to three days.
[00:09:29.057 --> 00:09:31.858]  I was told that information yesterday from multiple sources.
[00:09:32.318 --> 00:09:33.039]  I ran it by
[00:09:37.873 --> 00:09:46.462]  Another very trusted source, who's known to most of you, and they concurred that that is indeed the case.
[00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:51.387]  Obviously, ICE and the U.S.
[00:09:51.427 --> 00:09:55.432]  military have moles inside the Soros operations.
[00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.155]  And it is Soros that is
[00:09:59.676 --> 00:10:01.217]  Quarterbacking it with U.S.
[00:10:01.257 --> 00:10:21.774]  taxpayer money and what Trump needs to do is cut off the money to USAID because it's going directly to foment people kidnapping children and using them as human shields as the president and as the head of the Border Patrol has said and the media is trying to spin it like Trump's claiming it.
[00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:25.698]  It's a fact when they break through they hold the children up as shields.
[00:10:27.492 --> 00:10:30.993]  It's a fact that this is done with Middle Easterners as well when they come into Europe.
[00:10:33.714 --> 00:10:40.636]  It's a fact that they are being led by these UN non-governmental organizations.
[00:10:43.757 --> 00:10:44.637]  And it's a fact
[00:10:46.519 --> 00:11:13.778]  That there are almost no women and children in the group, so when you saw the cropped photo put on every major news site and all over TV and promoted by corporate establishment media of the woman, who looks like she's had a couple extra meals here and there, with two little girls in diapers and underwear with no shoes, obviously stripped down by the camera people to make it look even more desperate,
[00:11:14.997 --> 00:11:33.209]  And then you've actually got all the cameramen surrounding for the photo shoot, but then when it's put on CNN by Don Lemon, or you go find it anywhere in the news, type in, Caravan Woman Children, hit Google Images, and you'll see this everywhere, cropped.
[00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:42.595]  I even saw photos where they photoshopped sand behind her head, where it looked like she was out there by herself.
[00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:47.310]  This is deception, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.070]  That is doctoring.
[00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:52.451]  That is staging.
[00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:59.332]  Not zooming in on Jim Acosta trying to grab the mic away and pushing the intern's arm down.
[00:12:01.412 --> 00:12:13.275]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to break down what the master plan is for your children and for all the children of this world.
[00:12:14.372 --> 00:12:32.257]  And the absolute pure evil being carried out by the United Nations and by Soros and by the Clintons, whose foundations have all been caught up to their eyeballs in child and adult female trafficking.
[00:12:34.858 --> 00:12:37.099]  And I'm going to show you all the mainstream news articles
[00:12:38.274 --> 00:12:44.618]  from years ago that they think you don't remember and then point out that Trump is saying there's grabbers, there's child grabbers.
[00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:46.318]  Well, it's admitted that they grab children.
[00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:54.663]  Children, a bunch of children have been grabbed off the streets in Mexico by the smugglers, especially a two or three year old.
[00:12:55.504 --> 00:13:01.247]  You can grab that child and then you're going to get more aid, you're going to get more charity, you're going to get more everything.
[00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:05.129]  And then once you get to the U.S., you can sell them and the Democrats show up
[00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:10.352]  With the different Catholic charities and others, and the children are never seen again, some are found dead.
[00:13:13.074 --> 00:13:14.615]  So, that's what's going on here.
[00:13:15.355 --> 00:13:25.182]  And so this is a total free-for-all, and once they get here, under Obama, they just let them load on buses, load on trains, load on vans, and they're never seen again.
[00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:35.849]  But you see, the compliant media shows photos of a woman with these little kids in their diapers, or in their underwear running, all staged,
[00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.711]  And say the answer is let her get across with the kids.
[00:13:42.632 --> 00:13:43.412]  And look at those kids.
[00:13:43.432 --> 00:13:45.333]  They don't really look like her kids, do they?
[00:13:46.133 --> 00:13:46.573]  Just saying.
[00:13:46.753 --> 00:13:47.853]  Don't look like her much, do they?
[00:13:50.134 --> 00:13:53.275]  All I know is she just took them thousands of miles and they don't have shoes?
[00:13:54.436 --> 00:13:56.036]  And they're wearing diapers and underwear?
[00:13:56.056 --> 00:13:59.918]  She doesn't like potty training either.
[00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:03.719]  She got like three four-year-olds that don't know how to wipe their ass?
[00:14:07.403 --> 00:14:08.405]  Now this is a staged photo.
[00:14:08.526 --> 00:14:09.187]  It's a mentalist act.
[00:14:10.848 --> 00:14:12.148]  Make it look as scary as possible.
[00:14:12.709 --> 00:14:13.929]  Stick a diaper on that one.
[00:14:13.969 --> 00:14:14.929]  Have this one in their underwear.
[00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:18.290]  Get a whole big giant group of international camera people around.
[00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:20.091]  There's video from the other side too.
[00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:21.971]  There's camera people 360 all around her.
[00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:24.052]  Staging her running, running, running.
[00:14:24.212 --> 00:14:25.773]  Because you gotta have some women and children in there.
[00:14:26.013 --> 00:14:27.493]  And there's some real women and children in there.
[00:14:27.953 --> 00:14:28.814]  And there's video of it.
[00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.454]  There's men wearing masks with kids.
[00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:31.054]  They're crying.
[00:14:31.775 --> 00:14:32.935]  And they go, no, no, no.
[00:14:32.995 --> 00:14:34.475]  We've been to El Norte before.
[00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:36.576]  Yes, we businessmen.
[00:14:36.656 --> 00:14:37.836]  Ha, ha, ha, yeah.
[00:14:38.157 --> 00:14:39.157]  We businessmen.
[00:14:40.856 --> 00:14:45.457]  And as they come up through Guatemala and Mexico, they grab your child.
[00:14:48.297 --> 00:14:51.358]  And then they bring him up here and they get top dollar.
[00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.878]  And the Democrats are waiting with their buses.
[00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:56.459]  And no one even gets the names of the children.
[00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.539]  And they just get on the buses under Obama.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.520]  And they disappear forever.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.741]  Oh, and even the Washington Post, the New York Times, they all had to admit it.
[00:15:09.312 --> 00:15:10.693]  They all had to admit it.
[00:15:10.793 --> 00:15:11.833]  It's in a Senate report.
[00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:13.594]  Document cam shot, please.
[00:15:14.494 --> 00:15:15.535]  Here's the Senate report.
[00:15:17.976 --> 00:15:23.819]  United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee of Investigations Protecting Undocumented Alien Children from Trafficking and Other Abuses.
[00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:26.280]  The role of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.
[00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:33.644]  And how the UN's involved, and how Obama allowed the trafficking of children that then disappeared.
[00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:36.707]  That's the Washington Post, New York Times even had to admit it.
[00:15:37.047 --> 00:15:39.849]  But now, a few years later, they defend it all and say nothing's happening.
[00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:46.895]  Because now the pedophiles and the traffickers are in full control of the media and most of the government, and Trump's trying to fight it.
[00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:49.457]  And they say, you shut up, Trump.
[00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:51.439]  There's no kids getting hurt.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.762]  You let them load us on those buses and disappear them.
[00:15:55.852 --> 00:15:59.537]  Oh, Netflix has a new movie coming out that's pro-pedophilia.
[00:15:59.878 --> 00:16:01.019]  Shows little girls getting raped.
[00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:02.801]  Trading?
[00:16:06.026 --> 00:16:06.687]  Alright, you rolling?
[00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:09.871]  What am I gonna say?
[00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:26.811]  There is a corporate consortium of anti-free market monopoly men who have allied themselves with Communist China, the dictatorial EU, America hating Hollywood, and others who think Americans are a bunch of dumb chumps who they can walk in here and rob.
[00:16:26.831 --> 00:16:29.495]  That it was basic American free market liberty.
[00:16:31.184 --> 00:16:33.026]  That produced all this incredible wealth.
[00:16:33.547 --> 00:16:43.477]  So we should stand up against globalism, not just for the wealth, but because the globalists are so incredibly oppressive and ally themselves with every horrible form of...
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:46.981]  Evil regime.
[00:16:47.461 --> 00:16:48.442]  Radical Islam.
[00:16:48.462 --> 00:16:49.823]  The communist Chinese.
[00:16:49.903 --> 00:16:53.305]  The evil Juncker of the EU.
[00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:54.626]  It's just crazy.
[00:16:55.167 --> 00:16:56.668]  Of course we can beat these people.
[00:16:57.068 --> 00:16:58.669]  Of course they can be stopped.
[00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.172]  But we have to stand against them and say no to their operation.
[00:17:02.612 --> 00:17:05.535]  I always wondered 30 years ago why we couldn't defeat the globalists.
[00:17:06.075 --> 00:17:08.937]  Then about 25 years ago, I got politically involved.
[00:17:09.157 --> 00:17:10.898]  23 years ago, I got on air, and then I learned why.
[00:17:10.918 --> 00:17:12.519]  Because you get fired.
[00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:14.320]  Because you get demonized.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.340]  Because you get sued.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.061]  Because you get physically assaulted.
[00:17:18.462 --> 00:17:20.403]  And the globalists are betting you're a bunch of cowards.
[00:17:20.984 --> 00:17:23.305]  And so you'll never stick your head up, because you don't want that to happen.
[00:17:24.165 --> 00:17:29.829]  But instead, you have your whole birthright stolen, you become a slave, and you die a thousand deaths instead of one death.
[00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:33.111]  Well, I'd rather die that one death instead of a thousand, but we don't have to die.
[00:17:34.482 --> 00:17:36.464]  We've simply got to get engaged.
[00:17:36.604 --> 00:17:39.166]  They fear the InfoWars audience, because you're not a regular audience.
[00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:44.510]  You are men and women in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about in that beautiful speech.
[00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:48.053]  And that's why I know we're going to win.
[00:17:48.173 --> 00:17:55.239]  Because of you, every race, color, and creed who have red blood, who believe in liberty, I stand with you, you stand with me, and it's amazing.
[00:17:55.899 --> 00:17:57.399]  That's why we're launching another initiative.
[00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:02.520]  I know it got Trump's attention when I sent 100,000 letters to him a year and a half ago about internet censorship.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.361]  We're going to send a million letters at WriteTrump.com.
[00:18:07.421 --> 00:18:08.882]  You can print it off yourself and mail it.
[00:18:09.702 --> 00:18:11.082]  That way, two letters go per person.
[00:18:11.122 --> 00:18:14.843]  But regardless, I'm going to mail it in an envelope to the White House.
[00:18:14.923 --> 00:18:18.323]  I want to send about 80% of whatever we get in.
[00:18:18.343 --> 00:18:19.684]  I hope it will be a million.
[00:18:19.704 --> 00:18:20.164]  That's up to you.
[00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:22.099]  To the White House.
[00:18:22.139 --> 00:18:23.580]  Another 100,000 to Mar-a-Lago.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.121]  Another 100,000 to Trump Tower.
[00:18:25.401 --> 00:18:28.482]  So there's no way the President isn't knee-deep in these.
[00:18:28.542 --> 00:18:30.423]  And he pays attention to a letter.
[00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.844]  He sees that as like 10,000 emails.
[00:18:33.285 --> 00:18:34.205]  That you took action.
[00:18:34.225 --> 00:18:34.985]  That you got involved.
[00:18:35.206 --> 00:18:41.769]  Separately, when you sign up, we'll be able to send you alerts about the fight against censorship and against the globalists.
[00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:42.169]  So again,
[00:18:43.493 --> 00:18:44.515]  RightTrump.com.
[00:18:44.535 --> 00:18:47.099]  Go read the letter that Roger Stone and I have written to the President.
[00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:49.223]  You can add your own or just send it alone.
[00:18:49.723 --> 00:18:51.286]  Again, print it off, send it yourself.
[00:18:51.366 --> 00:18:52.568]  We're going to send it regardless.
[00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:53.490]  It's so easy.
[00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.551]  Go spend two minutes.
[00:18:55.032 --> 00:18:55.773]  Go to RightTrump.com.
[00:18:57.148 --> 00:18:58.109]  Sign up, send a letter.
[00:18:58.329 --> 00:18:59.670]  It'll be legitimately from you.
[00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:05.553]  Hopefully you add something to it so that there'll be a two-page letter, not just our letter, and this will have a big effect.
[00:19:05.973 --> 00:19:07.954]  And regardless, it gets the globalist attention.
[00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:09.075]  So we're not laying down.
[00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:12.237]  We're not just curling up in a ball in the fetal position and taking all this crap.
[00:19:12.577 --> 00:19:15.259]  Trump has said he's getting ready for antitrust action against Big Tech.
[00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:18.701]  He's getting ready to take on the globalist media that is the enemy of the people.
[00:19:19.181 --> 00:19:25.145]  We have to stand with the president now more than ever, and we have to let him know there's a coalition of a million people
[00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:28.451]  I'm gonna found an organization very soon as well.
[00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:31.578]  That's another reason to come sign up with us so I can stay in contact with you.
[00:19:31.598 --> 00:19:36.508]  But this is phase one to show the president we're sending him a million real letters.
[00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:39.112]  It's all about to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:39.452 --> 00:19:44.255]  We can do it if you take action and tell others to take action at WriteTrump.com.
[00:19:44.315 --> 00:19:58.605]  So go there yourself, text message, email your friends, neighbors, family, and tell them, get involved and stand up to Apple, stand up to Google, stand up to Facebook, stand up to Twitter and let them know America is unifying, America and the world is organizing and taking action.
[00:19:59.145 --> 00:19:59.826]  God bless you all.
[00:20:06.431 --> 00:20:10.657]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:17.846]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:18.206 --> 00:20:21.550]  America es wunderbar!
[00:20:22.091 --> 00:20:24.474]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:37.905]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:39.448]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:42.592]  We're going to cover the heart of the globalist program.
[00:20:42.612 --> 00:20:50.023]  Dehumanization, deindustrialization for the general public, and sterilization of our children.
[00:20:51.141 --> 00:21:12.039]  And to do that they have to package it as a wonderful human right promoted by the United Nations through UNESCO and then all treaty signers of that then have their education system under the UNESCO program set up by, of course, Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's brother.
[00:21:12.979 --> 00:21:22.924]  The former head of the World Government Society, the former head of the World Eugenics Society, and the founder of the World Transhumanist Society.
[00:21:24.225 --> 00:21:39.453]  He wrote in the 50s, first we will blur between men and women, and then we will end the family itself, and then we will begin the sterilization of the children as a right, giving children the rights of adults by age five.
[00:21:40.987 --> 00:21:45.489]  And now in the US, six-year-olds are being taken, and chemical castration is beginning.
[00:21:45.689 --> 00:21:54.112]  If the school convinces the child they want it, if the mother and father say no, after the child has mentally traumatized the child, the child is taken.
[00:21:55.072 --> 00:22:05.576]  And in some countries, the testicles are chopped off right away, but in others, they just begin the toxic hormone blockers, which also stunt growth and massively cause cancer.
[00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:08.698]  But this is just, this is happening.
[00:22:09.018 --> 00:22:09.558]  It's all done.
[00:22:10.936 --> 00:22:12.498]  The abuse, the torture, the evil.
[00:22:13.779 --> 00:22:16.021]  It's all in the name of a wonderful right.
[00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:17.222]  It's wonderful.
[00:22:17.422 --> 00:22:19.985]  But let's start at the other end of this.
[00:22:21.446 --> 00:22:28.372]  The UN is world famous if you actually study the news and court cases.
[00:22:29.153 --> 00:22:30.294]  Until about a year ago.
[00:22:30.635 --> 00:22:34.098]  Now the corporate press is so controlled they won't even report on it.
[00:22:35.643 --> 00:22:47.549]  Reuters reported on thousands of missing children, tens of thousands missing, hundreds found dead, snuff filmed by the UN in one country alone, Haiti.
[00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.511]  We broke it two years before with precision.
[00:22:51.231 --> 00:22:54.373]  AP report documents child sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers in Haiti.
[00:22:56.334 --> 00:23:07.701]  Just like the tens of thousands of kids brutally raped, including satanic rituals by so-called Catholic priests in Pennsylvania alone, no one's going to be indicted because even the Fed said it would bring down civilization.
[00:23:09.442 --> 00:23:13.784]  Up to 15 men at a time raping little boys as young as six.
[00:23:15.505 --> 00:23:22.029]  And they would tell them when dozens of men deposited their fetid
[00:23:24.189 --> 00:23:25.050]  Look it up!
[00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:32.258]  This is a group of devil worshippers that take over every institution
[00:23:50.444 --> 00:23:51.565]  Let's look at this headline.
[00:23:51.965 --> 00:23:55.367]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers.
[00:23:56.027 --> 00:23:57.008]  The Washington Post.
[00:23:57.028 --> 00:23:57.408]  Remember that?
[00:23:59.189 --> 00:24:08.975]  But the Border Patrol chief comes out and says they're using kids as human shields, which is on video, and that many of them are kidnapped kids, just like a homeless person will kidnap your dog and then use it to get donations.
[00:24:09.975 --> 00:24:10.656]  They won't even feed them.
[00:24:11.676 --> 00:24:13.417]  You ever wonder why the homeless have the poor dogs?
[00:24:13.477 --> 00:24:14.398]  It's to get money off you.
[00:24:14.418 --> 00:24:17.740]  Well, it's the same if they have the children as a shield.
[00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:21.248]  Donald Trump warns of migrant grabbers of children on the border.
[00:24:21.568 --> 00:24:23.289]  Mainstream media attacks him.
[00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.431]  Says it's not true.
[00:24:25.951 --> 00:24:27.212]  Actively covering up.
[00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:30.595]  Oh, but look at this.
[00:24:32.043 --> 00:24:32.303]  U.S.
[00:24:32.343 --> 00:24:34.825]  placed immigrant children with traffickers, report says.
[00:24:34.965 --> 00:24:35.646]  Senate report.
[00:24:36.266 --> 00:24:37.267]  Show you the Senate report in a moment.
[00:24:37.668 --> 00:24:39.809]  That's the New York Times, but see that was two years ago.
[00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.531]  They won't do that now.
[00:24:42.191 --> 00:24:42.411]  No.
[00:24:43.412 --> 00:24:45.133]  Because they've been fully taken over.
[00:24:45.153 --> 00:24:48.756]  Around 100 migrant caravan members have been kidnapped by human traffickers.
[00:24:49.957 --> 00:24:50.598]  London Independent.
[00:24:51.516 --> 00:24:52.276]  That's two weeks ago.
[00:24:52.777 --> 00:24:58.059]  But Cortez, Congresswoman Cortez, calls for sending 5,000 caseworkers to border to process visa applicants.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.200]  That's what Obama would do, just let them in.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.761]  That's what she means, just help the trafficking.
[00:25:03.782 --> 00:25:05.983]  Report UN's shame.
[00:25:06.264 --> 00:25:09.485]  Report reveals shame of UN peacekeepers all over the world.
[00:25:09.525 --> 00:25:15.788]  The UN's main business is actually trafficking women and children because they've got international diplomatic immunity.
[00:25:15.828 --> 00:25:16.549]  That's what they do.
[00:25:18.883 --> 00:25:22.605]  AP exclusive, UN child sex ring left victims but no arrest.
[00:25:24.346 --> 00:25:26.127]  Hundreds dead, thousands missing.
[00:25:26.147 --> 00:25:27.027]  It's a huge report.
[00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:27.447]  Go read it.
[00:25:28.788 --> 00:25:30.149]  Word for word, we told you years before.
[00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:32.110]  UN sex trafficking whistleblower.
[00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:33.771]  Fetched in film.
[00:25:33.791 --> 00:25:37.713]  80% of Central American women and girls are rape crossing into the US.
[00:25:39.754 --> 00:25:40.294]  Huffington Post.
[00:25:42.773 --> 00:25:43.933]  They're desperate, then they're right.
[00:25:43.993 --> 00:25:45.334]  Migrant women face sexual assault.
[00:25:45.554 --> 00:25:46.754]  Where do you think the rapers go?
[00:25:46.774 --> 00:25:49.835]  They've got to be part of the U.N., part of the refugee camps, part of all of it.
[00:25:50.456 --> 00:25:53.937]  Is rape the price to pay for migrant women chasing the American dream?
[00:25:55.177 --> 00:25:56.818]  And here's the Senate report for TV viewers.
[00:25:57.978 --> 00:25:59.279]  It's all right there, the U.N.
[00:25:59.319 --> 00:26:00.119]  involved, all of it.
[00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:20.051]  But when I talk about Robert Mueller knowing that Jeffrey Epstein was doing this on his Alita Express with hundreds of little girls and world leaders having sex with him, and it turned out that Mueller was running cameras in there to set all these people up and blackmail them, the media covered for him and said that I said he was raping children.
[00:26:21.091 --> 00:26:24.092]  When I specifically said he doesn't do it, he just runs it.
[00:26:26.953 --> 00:26:28.053]  Oh, let's be scared of him!
[00:26:28.513 --> 00:26:29.814]  Oh, we all know!
[00:26:32.025 --> 00:26:34.627]  Delivering uranium on tarmacs to the Russians and everything else?
[00:26:34.647 --> 00:26:37.069]  And then running around indicting all these innocent people?
[00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:39.030]  You gonna stand up for these kids?
[00:26:40.271 --> 00:26:41.772]  Most of you aren't men, you're not.
[00:26:42.593 --> 00:26:44.214]  You're gonna bow down to this monster.
[00:26:44.354 --> 00:26:46.256]  But let me tell you something, he'll face God.
[00:26:47.076 --> 00:26:48.637]  Robert Mueller will face God.
[00:26:49.178 --> 00:26:52.660]  And God will bring vengeance upon him.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.681]  Don't you worry about that.
[00:26:54.101 --> 00:26:58.665]  I don't wish any harm on the little chinny-chin-chin of him.
[00:27:02.878 --> 00:27:06.141]  But you see, these people are monsters.
[00:27:07.943 --> 00:27:12.087]  Oh, but don't worry, Netflix's Girl sparks controversy over underage nudity.
[00:27:12.588 --> 00:27:23.278]  And it shows the naked little girl who's a boy, and then there's another Netflix show about girls and sex trafficking, being raped, and then they show that.
[00:27:23.979 --> 00:27:25.821]  And it's just a way to get it on the air.
[00:27:27.403 --> 00:27:29.044]  Netflix's Girls First Controversy.
[00:27:29.825 --> 00:27:31.727]  And again, this is a total deception.
[00:27:31.827 --> 00:27:32.487]  It's a boy.
[00:27:33.048 --> 00:27:44.537]  They call it a girl and then show a boy with male genitals and say that the ballerina is really a girl.
[00:27:45.838 --> 00:27:48.901]  In 1984, the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 is freedom.
[00:27:49.241 --> 00:27:51.363]  The ability to say men are men, women are women is freedom.
[00:27:51.623 --> 00:27:52.584]  But again, that's the cult.
[00:27:54.682 --> 00:28:12.857]  They can put Caitlyn Jenner, really Bruce Jenner, an ugly old man who hit and runs people, up there with his snaggled teeth and his old ugly monster nose, and call him the woman of the year at how gorgeous he is.
[00:28:15.287 --> 00:28:18.908]  They even have art where they sell it for like $10 million and it's dog feces.
[00:28:18.928 --> 00:28:20.068]  And you ask, why would they do it?
[00:28:20.108 --> 00:28:21.749]  Because it's a satanic gift.
[00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:28.771]  When they buy that art for $10 million, a pile of dog manure, and don't give it to starving children, it's celebrating the ugliness.
[00:28:29.231 --> 00:28:37.374]  It's celebrating an old, ugly man with a huge, giant male member and saying it's a woman.
[00:28:37.414 --> 00:28:41.435]  It's all about upside-down world to just absolutely destroy logic.
[00:28:44.173 --> 00:29:06.727]  And you see, it's all about sexualizing your children to suck the energy and then rape their future and steal their identity and absolutely brain damage them in the most horrible abuse ever with a bunch of perverts and pedophiles being the new high priest of corrupting and brainwashing your children before they... We've had the biggest sales in our history.
[00:29:08.168 --> 00:29:12.731]  Because it's end of year, we want to get all the stock out, so let's pay inventory on it.
[00:29:13.982 --> 00:29:18.426]  George Soros has been trying to shut us down, trying to take our banking away, where we can't even process credit cards.
[00:29:19.027 --> 00:29:21.088]  You saw PayPal and others go, but we've got others.
[00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:29.496]  But I'm not going to sit there with a full warehouse of t-shirts, water filters, air filters, high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds, really high-quality supplements.
[00:29:29.656 --> 00:29:34.360]  We're moving to sell everything by the end of the year and clear out our warehouse.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.403]  And to do that, we're giving the biggest specials ever on everything.
[00:29:37.603 --> 00:29:40.484]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off on the high quality supplements.
[00:29:40.744 --> 00:30:06.268]  That's X2, X3, Brain Force, Ultimate Bone Broth, Super Mel Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Colloidal Silver, Super Blue Fluoride Free, Iodine and Colloidal Silver Fortified Toothpaste and Mouthwash, Happys, Mood and Body, Knockout, Ultimate Sleek Formula, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Bodies with 95% Humidoids, DNA Force, what an incredible deal on that flagship product, Pollen Block, Bio-True Selenium, Vitamin Mineral Fusion,
[00:30:06.408 --> 00:30:07.609]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:30:07.629 --> 00:30:09.149]  We're going to have to end one of these specials.
[00:30:09.249 --> 00:30:16.733]  I may be able to extend this Cyber Monday special to Wednesday or Thursday, but one of the sales that's got to end is the Alexa Pure Pro Stainless Steel Gravity Fed Filter for 127.
[00:30:17.453 --> 00:30:22.435]  That is because the folks that make it want to get rid of it all before the end of the year, and they only had a couple thousand.
[00:30:22.515 --> 00:30:26.197]  It's down to less than 500 right now, so that's going to end in the next few days.
[00:30:26.217 --> 00:30:28.458]  Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration System.
[00:30:28.678 --> 00:30:29.679]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, 1.27.
[00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:31.760]  Leading competitors aren't as good at 3.50.
[00:30:32.381 --> 00:30:34.702]  It's a great deal at 2.49, usually.
[00:30:34.903 --> 00:30:36.003]  Now it's at 1.27.
[00:30:36.544 --> 00:30:40.026]  So, for yourself, your family, as a gift, it's a great time to do it.
[00:30:40.126 --> 00:30:41.287]  A lot of these are lost leaders.
[00:30:41.547 --> 00:30:43.729]  Take advantage of it and fund the InfoWar today.
[00:30:43.949 --> 00:30:44.730]  It's all there.
[00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:46.251]  50% off their minimum.
[00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:48.993]  Some of it is 75% off.
[00:30:49.333 --> 00:30:51.074]  Double Patriot points on top of free shipping.
[00:30:51.174 --> 00:30:52.796]  Instead of 5 points, what's your next purchase?
[00:30:53.076 --> 00:30:53.316]  10 points.

[00:32:02.365 --> 00:32:06.047]  Super silver wound gel uses silver salt technology.
[00:32:06.327 --> 00:32:09.749]  There's been extensive research on silver salt technology.
[00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:19.495]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity.
[00:32:20.155 --> 00:32:20.535]  ...study.
[00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:23.577]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[00:32:23.917 --> 00:32:28.879]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[00:32:28.939 --> 00:32:31.300]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:36.262]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[00:32:36.282 --> 00:32:36.822]  Ah, you don't want that.
[00:32:37.242 --> 00:32:41.044]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[00:32:41.264 --> 00:32:43.925]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[00:32:44.185 --> 00:32:47.507]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[00:32:47.867 --> 00:32:53.169]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[00:32:53.249 --> 00:32:57.391]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[00:32:58.252 --> 00:33:00.933]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[00:33:05.976 --> 00:33:08.637]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:24.122 --> 00:33:28.064]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:30.365]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:30.626 --> 00:33:31.806]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:32.406 --> 00:33:38.690]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:52.305 --> 00:33:55.047]  I have read the declassified reports.
[00:33:55.067 --> 00:33:58.549]  I have read the Italian reports, the Russian reports, the U.S.
[00:33:58.589 --> 00:33:58.970]  reports.
[00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.932]  I've interviewed the top psychiatrists that work in the prisons.
[00:34:03.052 --> 00:34:04.473]  I have looked at every angle of it.
[00:34:04.753 --> 00:34:19.964]  I have read tens of thousands of news articles over the years, where they've even caught, in castles in France, in one time on a Rothschild estate, a bunch of kidnapped women, some of them dead in cages, dead bodies of little kids, and it just hits the news and it's gone.
[00:34:20.604 --> 00:34:21.625]  Snuff films where they're
[00:34:22.926 --> 00:34:26.009]  Twenty men are raping toddlers and blowing their heads off.
[00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.251]  I'm sorry to have to talk about all this.
[00:34:29.592 --> 00:34:30.533]  But this is going on.
[00:34:30.553 --> 00:34:34.056]  I have personally seen thousands of articles over the years.
[00:34:35.277 --> 00:34:37.499]  Now they've got such control of the press you don't see it as much.
[00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:49.525]  Where the UN in any war zone literally grabs good-looking teenage girls off the street and children and loads them on C-130s and flies them into the Middle East.
[00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:53.707]  Saudi Arabia actually has harems of kidnapped women.
[00:34:54.853 --> 00:34:55.894]  Other areas do as well.
[00:34:55.954 --> 00:35:07.969]  And Bill Clinton flies into these different Arab Emirate areas, some areas even worse than Saudi Arabia, and there's famous sultans that literally have kidnapped men, women and children.
[00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:09.551]  Whatever you want.
[00:35:09.671 --> 00:35:13.215]  And Jerry Epstein would fly there with Bill Clinton over and over again.
[00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:24.934]  The police reports, I've had congressmen on, I've had state reps on, who were raped by these satanic cults that have taken over the Catholic Church in Pennsylvania.
[00:35:26.054 --> 00:35:27.155]  They've been on this show!
[00:35:27.175 --> 00:35:38.018]  And it's in the police reports and confirmed, and they've got priests admitting that 10, 15 men, I don't want to talk about this on air, but it's happening.
[00:35:38.158 --> 00:35:44.680]  Well, get your little kid inside of the church at night and rape them.
[00:35:47.233 --> 00:35:51.514]  Right in front of the statue of Christ, right in front of the crucifix.
[00:35:52.194 --> 00:35:54.855]  And that's exactly what Satanists do.
[00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:56.315]  It's about blaspheming.
[00:35:56.335 --> 00:35:59.416]  And I'm not going to get into everything else they do, okay?
[00:36:00.856 --> 00:36:09.638]  But it's like the Piss Christ that Mel Gibson got mad about 30 years ago, where for hundreds of thousands of dollars, U.S.
[00:36:09.678 --> 00:36:15.519]  taxpayer money was paying for a photo of a crucifix in a glass of urine.
[00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:19.710]  That a gay photographer took, who was dying of AIDS.
[00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:25.353]  Oh, you're dying of a pestilence, and you're blaspheming Christ, and oh, here's a bunch of money.
[00:36:26.954 --> 00:36:29.255]  These are satanic sacraments.
[00:36:30.716 --> 00:36:45.844]  And so when you can go corrupt a child, and confuse them, and make them think they're a girl or a boy, or there isn't any gender, and get them to opt in, and go around their parents, and have the state trick your child into being sterilized, chemically or by castration.
[00:36:47.543 --> 00:36:51.884]  That is so incredibly powerful to a satanist.
[00:36:52.824 --> 00:36:56.265]  That is destroying the life force and the potential of a child.
[00:36:56.965 --> 00:37:07.808]  And you look at these children, they have the highest rates of suicide, the highest rates of incarceration, the highest rates of drug use and drug abuse, and they just look like dead zombies.
[00:37:09.915 --> 00:37:12.239]  And if you're around Hollywood, you'll see the controllers.
[00:37:12.259 --> 00:37:17.266]  They'll have a gaggle of grown men that look like brainwashed, brain-damaged little boys.
[00:37:17.627 --> 00:37:22.875]  And they're all being led around behind these keepers that are sucking their energy.
[00:37:23.736 --> 00:37:25.238]  And they'll tell you that's what they're doing!
[00:37:26.352 --> 00:37:27.633]  Psychic vampires!
[00:37:28.514 --> 00:37:32.417]  Like, let's show for TV viewers the Netflix girl sparks controversy.
[00:37:32.918 --> 00:37:40.925]  Oh, it's a girl who's really a boy and they have an actor doing it and show him naked in his genitals in simulated pedophilia.
[00:37:44.147 --> 00:37:46.029]  And this is about the total assault.
[00:37:46.049 --> 00:37:46.409]  Look at this.
[00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.450]  Mom 6 says,
[00:37:48.806 --> 00:37:51.508]  Mom says six-year-old son is transgender.
[00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:53.270]  Dad disagrees.
[00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:58.795]  Now he might lose his son, and the little boy is set for chemical castration.
[00:38:01.357 --> 00:38:02.398]  And he's in a blue city.
[00:38:03.779 --> 00:38:05.801]  So bye-bye testicles.
[00:38:09.144 --> 00:38:09.484]  Hey!
[00:38:09.944 --> 00:38:10.325]  Teacher!
[00:38:10.685 --> 00:38:11.806]  Leave them kids alone!
[00:38:12.607 --> 00:38:15.189]  Mama's gonna put all her fears into you.
[00:38:16.786 --> 00:38:17.866]  What's that Pink Floyd song?
[00:38:17.886 --> 00:38:23.469]  I mean, I know it's from the wall, but it's all about the abuse.
[00:38:23.769 --> 00:38:26.110]  I mean, you look at all this.
[00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.110]  This is so evil, and it's conscious.
[00:38:29.711 --> 00:38:35.973]  And you look at all these parents with their kids, they all look real weird and real weak and real sucked out, and they're like zombies.
[00:38:36.193 --> 00:38:43.136]  But when they do bad, evil stuff, they kind of get excited and go... And it's so much fun to them to do this, to your own child!
[00:38:45.947 --> 00:38:48.068]  You see the news is daddy's bad.
[00:38:48.088 --> 00:38:55.270]  Oh, and then on Infowars.com, Swedish headmaster wears dress to school to break norms.
[00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:02.031]  And of course it comes out in the news that they were told, don't tell your parents about it, but encourage the little boys to wear dresses.
[00:39:03.472 --> 00:39:04.952]  And tell the little girls they're the boss.
[00:39:05.792 --> 00:39:08.193]  All this is about is destroying our young men.
[00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:15.235]  If you were going to invade and destroy a culture, you would teach men not to be men, women not to be women.
[00:39:16.513 --> 00:39:20.774]  And then you would bring in outside, vicious, third-world populations.
[00:39:23.235 --> 00:39:26.556]  This is all a rampant, satanic exercise.
[00:39:27.957 --> 00:39:30.718]  Mom says six-year-old son is transgender.
[00:39:30.738 --> 00:39:31.358]  Dad disagrees.
[00:39:31.418 --> 00:39:33.018]  Now he might lose his son.
[00:39:33.598 --> 00:39:34.899]  And it goes into the article here.
[00:39:37.156 --> 00:39:41.621]  That he's not affirming James' transgender, but he's not emancipated.
[00:39:42.061 --> 00:39:43.142]  The boy's six years old.
[00:39:43.543 --> 00:39:57.257]  The mother is the one bringing all of this in, dressing him like a boy, because she has the main custody right now, and now she wants him totally terminated, because the father's talking to his son, saying, son, you're being brainwashed, you're being... I want this father on.
[00:39:57.677 --> 00:39:58.798]  Son, you don't have to do this.
[00:39:58.898 --> 00:40:00.240]  Oh, there's... In Houston, they have...
[00:40:01.584 --> 00:40:04.346]  Drag queen story time for your five-year-olds at the schools.
[00:40:04.666 --> 00:40:10.490]  And so parents are protesting and the news is talking about in Texas how bad these parents are.
[00:40:11.031 --> 00:40:19.477]  You don't want big obese men in clown makeup to come tell your kid and to shake their ass in their face and say, I've played the videos, shake your booty.
[00:40:19.557 --> 00:40:20.377]  You can be a boy.
[00:40:20.438 --> 00:40:21.158]  You can be a girl.
[00:40:21.198 --> 00:40:22.059]  You can be anything.
[00:40:22.339 --> 00:40:23.300]  A boy can be a girl.
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.180]  A girl can be a boy.
[00:40:24.641 --> 00:40:27.082]  I'm wearing a demon outfit telling you this.
[00:40:27.122 --> 00:40:28.223]  There's nothing wrong here.
[00:40:28.243 --> 00:40:30.645]  And if they can do that,
[00:40:32.651 --> 00:40:34.776]  They can do anything.
[00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:37.762]  But it says right here, they tell.
[00:40:39.534 --> 00:40:41.554]  The teachers don't tell the parents what we're doing.
[00:40:41.995 --> 00:40:44.155]  So you think the schools are locked up to stop mass shooters?
[00:40:44.835 --> 00:40:46.175]  No, not when the left has controlled them.
[00:40:46.395 --> 00:40:53.517]  They're all locked up and parents can't get in because there's some stuff going on in there, just like at the Catholic... Let me give you a big news flash.
[00:40:54.117 --> 00:40:54.737]  I'm not Catholic.
[00:40:54.757 --> 00:41:00.318]  I'm not defending the corruption of the Catholic Church, but the Catholic Church got exposed because the left wanted to fully take it over.
[00:41:00.918 --> 00:41:08.380]  It's as bad or worse in every major institution because there is a cult that wants the energy of children.
[00:41:09.864 --> 00:41:12.405]  Low levels just want to corrupt them and have sex with them.
[00:41:13.205 --> 00:41:14.426]  Higher level wants to torture.
[00:41:15.486 --> 00:41:19.347]  At the Dracula level, they're not real vampires, but they spiritually are.
[00:41:19.767 --> 00:41:22.508]  They torture your children to death.
[00:41:25.769 --> 00:41:30.671]  Some people are then inducted into the cult if they think they have vicious, evil potentiality.
[00:41:34.429 --> 00:41:39.855]  And I grew up in the richest county in Texas at the time, and I brushed into the edge of this.
[00:41:43.238 --> 00:41:44.239]  I brushed into the edge of it.
[00:41:44.439 --> 00:41:46.902]  I never took part in it, but I brushed it.
[00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:50.409]  So let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:51.049 --> 00:41:53.750]  You better think long and hard which side you're on here.
[00:41:54.150 --> 00:42:10.816]  Because the devil's real, Satan worship's real, and the whole world government system is going to be about brainwashing children, confusing them, drugging them, so that they can then be so confused they lose their free will, and so they can be fully spiritually assanguinated.
[00:42:12.457 --> 00:42:15.137]  These full-grown men, some of them weighing 400 to 500 pounds,
[00:42:17.523 --> 00:42:22.746]  Wearing G-strings, shake their wart-covered asses in the face of three-year-old boys and girls.
[00:42:25.047 --> 00:42:26.467]  They wear satanic outfits.
[00:42:26.488 --> 00:42:28.428]  They wear Dracula teeth.
[00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:43.216]  And they just... I mean, there's somebody we can't even show you that we shot in Austin at these public events where there are grown men with nothing but glitter on their genitals standing there writhing and hugging on little boys and girls.
[00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:46.810]  What we're showing you on screen is the light stuff.
[00:42:47.411 --> 00:42:51.935]  Because we're on TV stations around the country, I cannot show you all of it.
[00:42:51.955 --> 00:42:53.477]  This is why they took us off YouTube, they told us.
[00:42:53.917 --> 00:42:55.379]  Because we would show the abuse of children.
[00:42:55.719 --> 00:42:59.583]  Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
[00:42:59.603 --> 00:43:01.164]  They're gonna cut your balls off, that's right.
[00:43:03.126 --> 00:43:08.932]  What I'm about to break down is so simple and so apparent, so prima facie,
[00:43:11.394 --> 00:43:15.961]  That I almost don't want to play 2001 Space Odyssey music to build it up.
[00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:16.502]  But you know what?
[00:43:17.444 --> 00:43:19.467]  Simplicity and truth deserves it.
[00:43:20.572 --> 00:43:28.478]  Introducing Survival Shield X3, iodine in an energized quantum state, or an atomic state.
[00:43:28.778 --> 00:43:30.980]  That doesn't mean radioactive, it means elemental.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:43.009]  All three forms, including deep earth crystal iodine, two other forms and a tiny amount of vitamin C, to stop it from oxidizing and keep it in that state of true purity.
[00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:48.213]  So that when it hits your cells, when it goes into your body, it has the amazing effect.
[00:43:49.346 --> 00:43:51.326]  We all need oxygen to live on this planet.
[00:43:51.346 --> 00:43:53.247]  We all need water to live.
[00:43:53.267 --> 00:43:53.927]  We all need food.
[00:43:54.767 --> 00:44:03.289]  But there are other key building blocks, other key elements, that if we don't have them, well, we got a big problem.
[00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:09.010]  And Survival Shield X3 is the next level of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:16.412]  And what we've been able to develop and come up with takes the game-changing, trailblazing,
[00:44:18.054 --> 00:44:22.297]  Things that we witnessed with X2, and it takes it to a whole other level.
[00:44:22.337 --> 00:44:33.904]  We have it in two ounce bottles, we have it in one ounce bottles, and this is the best thing of scientists, chemists, researchers, to come up with a formula that is beyond true iodine.
[00:44:33.944 --> 00:44:37.686]  It is all forms of it, energized,
[00:44:38.906 --> 00:44:47.525]  Active and ready to energize the body the iodine in x3 comes from thousands of feet below the earth's surface hit
[00:44:48.736 --> 00:44:55.139]  From the oxygenation and radiation and toxins that are on the surface for tens of thousands of years.
[00:44:56.239 --> 00:45:04.203]  X3, ladies and gentlemen, is the, from our research, ultimate form of true atomic iodine.
[00:45:04.583 --> 00:45:10.926]  Fused with other forms of iodine and vitamin C to keep it in its energetic state.
[00:45:12.236 --> 00:45:19.463]  Look, I've got piles of papers and research and scientists I've been talking to for years, and to try to put it all in just a few minutes is impossible.
[00:45:20.003 --> 00:45:20.944]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:45:21.525 --> 00:45:24.848]  The globalists are pumping our environment full of bad halogens.
[00:45:25.028 --> 00:45:27.770]  Fluoride is just part of that.
[00:45:28.191 --> 00:45:32.975]  Iodine is the good halogen that the human body absolutely has to have to operate.
[00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:37.250]  And they have done everything they can to take that out of the environment.
[00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:44.113]  So our quest to bring people the very best supplements, the very best nutraceuticals, it was clear that iodine was critical.
[00:45:45.054 --> 00:45:49.095]  And we've gone through several permutations, and our research just gets better and better and better.
[00:45:49.376 --> 00:45:51.577]  And every time you reformulate, you give it a new name.
[00:45:52.217 --> 00:45:54.398]  Well, X3 is a quantum leap.
[00:45:55.822 --> 00:45:57.483]  From X1 and X2.
[00:45:58.144 --> 00:45:59.424]  And it's simply incredible.
[00:45:59.985 --> 00:46:02.366]  It's exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:02.787 --> 00:46:07.850]  I want you to go research it, look at the facts for yourself, but it is amazing.
[00:46:08.631 --> 00:46:15.535]  And what it's done for my stamina, my focus, my libido, everything is just incredible.
[00:46:15.555 --> 00:46:25.262]  And then I realized why the globalists have wanted to get it out of the food and out of the water and out of the food chain for 56 years because iodine, for me,
[00:46:25.945 --> 00:46:26.593]  It's like oxygen.
[00:46:28.627 --> 00:46:29.427]  It energizes.
[00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:30.788]  It gives life.
[00:46:30.928 --> 00:46:32.088]  It's everything.
[00:46:32.728 --> 00:46:40.470]  In your quest to have a better life for you, your family, your children, your wife, your husband, your co-workers, the military, police, you need to take care of yourselves.
[00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.851]  And iodine is the missing link.
[00:46:43.171 --> 00:46:43.671]  It's X3.
[00:46:43.691 --> 00:46:45.752]  It's available at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:46:46.352 --> 00:46:54.834]  In 2-ounce and 1-ounce, it's 50% off out of the gates and free shipping as our newest special at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:55.074 --> 00:46:56.795]  I want you to experience.
[00:46:57.535 --> 00:47:02.496]  This critical element that you're supposed to have for yourself.
[00:47:06.937 --> 00:47:09.697]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:10.397 --> 00:47:11.618]  Ooh, babe.
[00:47:15.238 --> 00:47:16.599]  Ooh, babe.
[00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:40.597]  So imagine if somebody told you 20 years ago that in 2018, in 1998,
[00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:53.243]  Somebody told you they would move against the family publicly, say the word mother and father is bad.
[00:47:53.723 --> 00:47:55.703]  He or she would be removed by Google.
[00:47:56.044 --> 00:47:59.325]  Google's announced that AI won't even let you type or search he or she.
[00:48:02.106 --> 00:48:06.267]  And that they would be targeting children nationwide at age five, telling them that they're really another gender.
[00:48:06.988 --> 00:48:13.090]  And then, if they could get the child to say they want to be another gender, that the government can emancipate them without even a court case.
[00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:16.655]  Giving them alcohol, whatever, is endangerment.
[00:48:16.995 --> 00:48:18.638]  Pedophile trying to have sex with them is endangerment.
[00:48:18.958 --> 00:48:29.896]  But if you can set the precedent to emancipate them and let them make adult decisions, currently it's age 8 that they are chemically sterilizing little boys in the U.S.
[00:48:31.778 --> 00:48:35.341]  And I've got the Houston Chronicle and other reports here where we're the straight face.
[00:48:36.141 --> 00:48:41.024]  The father doesn't want his six-year-old son to sign the paperwork to be sterilized.
[00:48:41.044 --> 00:48:43.126]  He's six and a half in a year and a half.
[00:48:43.646 --> 00:48:50.791]  So the court's moving with his mother to terminate his parental rights because he doesn't want his son to be chemically sterilized.
[00:48:53.833 --> 00:48:54.754]  He's the abuser!
[00:48:54.854 --> 00:48:55.875]  He's the bad man!
[00:48:55.935 --> 00:48:56.155]  See?
[00:48:56.395 --> 00:48:57.496]  Upside-down world.
[00:49:00.336 --> 00:49:03.918]  The LGBT pedophile community.
[00:49:05.098 --> 00:49:05.438]  You see?
[00:49:05.458 --> 00:49:10.721]  And they take our tolerance and our openness and have headlines every time I talk about it.
[00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:13.302]  Alex Jones and other transgender rant.
[00:49:14.602 --> 00:49:15.383]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:49:15.703 --> 00:49:23.146]  If an adult man wants to go have his testicles savagely cut off and turned upside down and, my God, you ought to watch the procedure.
[00:49:23.186 --> 00:49:23.806]  It's on YouTube.
[00:49:23.886 --> 00:49:24.567]  It's savage.
[00:49:25.441 --> 00:49:27.102]  Go watch the plastic surgery.
[00:49:27.743 --> 00:49:30.565]  If you're crazy and mentally ill, you want to cut your fingers off, go ahead and do it.
[00:49:31.166 --> 00:49:35.209]  I'm not going to have to pay for your nose job or having your tally whacker cut off.
[00:49:35.269 --> 00:49:35.669]  You got it?
[00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:38.812]  Or turned, you know, inside open like a fish filet.
[00:49:38.832 --> 00:49:42.354]  It's the same way they filet a flounder.
[00:49:43.475 --> 00:49:44.156]  Well, go watch it.
[00:49:44.736 --> 00:49:45.597]  Slice it open.
[00:49:46.017 --> 00:49:47.418]  I mean, it's hell on earth.
[00:49:48.939 --> 00:49:53.363]  Most of the people that do it end up committing suicide within 10 years or in a mental institution.
[00:49:53.763 --> 00:49:54.444]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:49:55.922 --> 00:50:01.707]  And the weirdo psychologist and psychiatrist in the system that convinces you to chop your genitals off.
[00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:22.084]  To mutilate yourself while the same government, the same federal court, that's ruled that we gotta pay for men to have their genitals cut off, or for women to take testosterone, to be quote men, same court ruled that
[00:50:23.766 --> 00:50:37.417]  Muslims can take their seven and nine-year-old daughters, drug them up illegally on barbiturates, and then have a Muslim doctor cut their entire clitoris off.
[00:50:38.057 --> 00:50:40.839]  And I'm sorry to have to use these terms, this is a family show, but you know what?
[00:50:40.859 --> 00:50:49.226]  They're teaching your kids to chop their Johnson off when they're age five, so I better go on adult radio and tell you what's happening.
[00:50:52.244 --> 00:50:54.545]  Because, you know, we've had faces before say, hey, please don't go there.
[00:50:54.805 --> 00:51:09.192]  Hey, I got video we shot in Austin at a public event of two-year-olds going up to men with only glitter, with their Johnson hanging down, with kids grabbing and hugging naked men with their genitals hanging out.
[00:51:09.692 --> 00:51:14.534]  And when we played that a year ago, some of our TV affiliates threatened to dump us.
[00:51:14.874 --> 00:51:17.095]  They're doing it to kids in public!
[00:51:17.395 --> 00:51:18.556]  I'm not the one doing it!
[00:51:22.793 --> 00:51:23.334]  But I get it!
[00:51:23.434 --> 00:51:24.475]  We're not going to show it here!
[00:51:26.898 --> 00:51:29.080]  By the way, YouTube did not have a problem with that.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.281]  They thought that was wonderful.
[00:51:33.265 --> 00:51:44.017]  God Almighty, if you're a radio listener, we're showing children giving giant fat transvestites money after they shake their huge butts in their faces.
[00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:46.811]  What planet are we on?
[00:51:46.931 --> 00:51:52.294]  We're on a planet where we're letting evil take over, and these people are just the useful idiots.
[00:51:54.715 --> 00:52:01.919]  You know, Trump came out and said that the United Nations is smuggling the people in, which is a public fact.
[00:52:02.179 --> 00:52:02.759]  They said he's a liar.
[00:52:03.259 --> 00:52:05.681]  He then said they've got a lot of kidnapped kids they're using as human shields.
[00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:06.201]  That's a fact.
[00:52:07.262 --> 00:52:09.423]  He then said they've got a lot of child-grabbing going on.
[00:52:09.523 --> 00:52:13.405]  I just showed you last segment, AP, Reuters, everything about
[00:52:14.355 --> 00:52:17.636]  Not just thousands kidnapped, hundreds dead!
[00:52:22.857 --> 00:52:27.678]  But now the entire left and the entire corporate media suddenly has gone dark on all this.
[00:52:28.138 --> 00:52:28.879]  They used to report on it.
[00:52:28.899 --> 00:52:31.479]  It was on the Washington Post from two years ago.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.141]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers.
[00:52:38.741 --> 00:52:39.981]  Senate reports, some were killed.
[00:52:40.801 --> 00:52:43.002]  And even Snopes on this one says, well, it's true.
[00:52:44.445 --> 00:52:45.305]  They almost always lie.
[00:52:45.585 --> 00:52:46.266]  I told the truth there.
[00:52:47.426 --> 00:52:49.667]  Broken clocks are right twice a day.
[00:52:50.948 --> 00:52:51.408]  But now?
[00:52:51.728 --> 00:52:52.068]  Nope.
[00:52:52.148 --> 00:52:53.008]  None of it's going on.
[00:52:53.068 --> 00:52:53.929]  None of it's happening.
[00:52:54.289 --> 00:52:57.950]  Because people have decided to join with pure evil.
[00:52:59.131 --> 00:53:00.231]  And we got calls from Twitter.
[00:53:00.251 --> 00:53:01.212]  We got calls from others.
[00:53:01.492 --> 00:53:02.472]  We recorded the calls.
[00:53:02.532 --> 00:53:03.573]  I've been so busy I haven't put them out.
[00:53:03.593 --> 00:53:04.813]  I think now's the time to put them out.
[00:53:05.393 --> 00:53:07.174]  Where we were talking to high-level people.
[00:53:07.854 --> 00:53:11.716]  Paul talks to some of the, like, right up to below Dorsey.
[00:53:12.796 --> 00:53:15.058]  Man, I'm not supposed to get into it.
[00:53:15.098 --> 00:53:15.978]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:53:20.922 --> 00:53:26.767]  But it's a total cult in San Francisco with giant, fetid, diseased tentacles reaching out across the nation.
[00:53:26.887 --> 00:53:30.570]  A once great state of California used to be redder than Texas.
[00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:34.673]  Redder than Texas in the 70s and 80s.
[00:53:36.674 --> 00:53:38.656]  It is now bluest of the blue.
[00:53:40.219 --> 00:53:45.222]  Feces, needles everywhere, crime, implosion, and its tentacles are invading the country.
[00:53:45.282 --> 00:53:46.683]  It says it's going to conquer Texas.
[00:53:47.764 --> 00:53:49.305]  I say deport Californians.
[00:53:49.745 --> 00:53:54.488]  Now if you want to be a refugee status, you can come to the rest of the U.S., but we literally have to build a wall around California.
[00:53:54.528 --> 00:53:55.129]  I'm serious!
[00:53:56.493 --> 00:53:56.753]  I'm serious.
[00:53:56.793 --> 00:53:57.213]  I'm serious.
[00:54:18.908 --> 00:54:24.109]  The California off and build a damn wall, man, because I live in Austin, and it's ruined this town.
[00:54:24.289 --> 00:54:26.150]  These are hateful, stupid, evil people.
[00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:27.070]  They're like locusts.
[00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:36.332]  They already ate California to the bone, losers from all over the country that went there to be somebody, and now they've come here to my Texas, and boy, they're Californian my Texas bad.
[00:54:36.352 --> 00:54:38.733]  I don't want to hear I'm authoritarian.
[00:54:38.753 --> 00:54:40.473]  Everywhere I go, the Californians march up.
[00:54:40.873 --> 00:54:44.794]  They're not even Californians, it's the scum, and they go, you get out of here, our beautiful town.
[00:54:47.881 --> 00:54:53.181]  You know, when your ancestors were serfs, my ancestors were here creating the state.
[00:54:55.663 --> 00:55:13.554]  And I'm not going to sit here and let you... So, it's a propaganda move, it's tongue-in-cheek, but I'm putting billboards up, everything, deport Californians, make them seek asylum, make them pledge that they're American, make them pledge that they renounce the California demon spirit, and then we welcome you.
[00:55:13.594 --> 00:55:18.277]  But America must wall off the parasite, California, now!
[00:55:20.939 --> 00:55:24.541]  Because they've said they're going to export it, they're going to export it everywhere.
[00:55:27.461 --> 00:55:30.142]  So we got California caravans coming your way.
[00:55:30.222 --> 00:55:31.343]  Incoming, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:31.883 --> 00:55:35.285]  And I mean, if you're from Michigan and escaping socialism, we love you.
[00:55:35.905 --> 00:55:38.046]  If you're from New York escaping all of it, great New Yorkers.
[00:55:38.066 --> 00:55:39.447]  You're from Florida, wherever, you're welcome.
[00:55:39.867 --> 00:55:40.828]  But let me tell you something.
[00:55:41.108 --> 00:55:46.471]  You're a globalist, you want to come here and try to get my guns and try to teach my kids how to chop their balls off?
[00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:48.832]  You can go jump right in the lake.
[00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:51.871]  Just get the hell out of here, you parasites!
[00:55:52.732 --> 00:56:02.678]  Now, you hate Christianity, you hate conservatism, you hate capitalism, but you're always fighting to get your fat ass in the middle of it so you can suck our blood, you scum!
[00:56:03.779 --> 00:56:05.260]  You get the hell away from me!
[00:56:06.281 --> 00:56:07.021]  And my children!
[00:56:07.862 --> 00:56:09.183]  I declare war on you!
[00:56:09.483 --> 00:56:10.403]  You declare it on me?
[00:56:10.423 --> 00:56:11.644]  You gotta war!
[00:56:11.924 --> 00:56:14.026]  We're about to pull out all the stops around here!
[00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:19.231]  And that said, I need massive funding.
[00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:20.392]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:56:20.812 --> 00:56:22.413]  Shiber Week's going on right now.
[00:56:22.514 --> 00:56:23.574]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:56:23.594 --> 00:56:24.815]  50-75% off.
[00:56:25.736 --> 00:56:26.957]  A lot of it's lost leaders.
[00:56:27.337 --> 00:56:28.558]  And double patriot points.
[00:56:28.578 --> 00:56:29.819]  And it's got to end in a couple days.
[00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:33.230]  Get your gifts early.
[00:56:33.351 --> 00:56:39.617]  Don't give it to Dima Zahn and Ali Pussabah, owned by the Communist Party and all its slaves.

[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:50.747]  The supplements, the t-shirts, the books, the films, and stick it in the eye of Soros and all the other bloodthirsty vampire trash.
[00:56:52.011 --> 00:56:52.892]  God bless you all.
[00:56:52.912 --> 00:56:54.132]  And whatever you do, spread the word.
[00:56:54.172 --> 00:56:56.114]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:56:56.414 --> 00:57:07.821]  Jam it down their throat as a badge of honor to be demonized and lied about by the collaborators and the cowards and the filth that have all signed on to worshiping the pedophilia and worshiping the devil worship.
[00:57:08.041 --> 00:57:08.702]  Well, guess what?
[00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:12.244]  I'm real proud to be enemy number one up against these people.
[00:57:12.424 --> 00:57:19.509]  And thank God for Trump flying that banner of Americana and no compromise and no compromise for Christianity and everything.
[00:57:20.407 --> 00:57:21.487]  God bless President Trump.
[00:57:21.828 --> 00:57:27.169]  I'm proud to stand by and watch all the other cowards hedge their bets and double-talk behind the President's back.
[00:57:27.429 --> 00:57:28.010]  Not me!
[00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:31.971]  Yeah, teacher, leave them kids alone.
[00:57:32.331 --> 00:57:34.132]  Stop trying to abuse those five-year-old boys.
[00:57:34.852 --> 00:57:44.656]  See, if they can't get the boys with the weaponized vaccines and the autism from 1 in 35,000 to 1 in 58 now, they'll get the rest, tell them they're little girls, and get them to sterilize themselves.
[00:57:45.816 --> 00:57:48.317]  All in all, it's a war on our boys.
[00:57:49.062 --> 00:57:50.682]  And it's a war on our girls as well.
[00:57:52.463 --> 00:57:58.484]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[00:57:59.905 --> 00:58:01.465]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[00:58:01.525 --> 00:58:02.125]  It's a good thing.
[00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:05.366]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[00:58:05.926 --> 00:58:08.347]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[00:58:08.367 --> 00:58:09.447]  I learned what the best was.
[00:58:10.127 --> 00:58:17.129]  And Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there
[00:58:17.469 --> 00:58:23.831]  And took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[00:58:23.851 --> 00:58:28.833]  Now the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[00:58:29.013 --> 00:58:33.475]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[00:58:33.955 --> 00:58:36.316]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[00:58:37.016 --> 00:58:41.378]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotsSupply that have developed these filters.
[00:58:43.064 --> 00:58:44.765]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[00:58:45.525 --> 00:58:47.806]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[00:58:47.826 --> 00:58:55.248]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out, or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[00:58:55.429 --> 00:58:58.730]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:00.730]  And that's not counting state taxes, a lot of states have.
[00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:01.591]  Texas has that too.
[00:59:01.631 --> 00:59:05.952]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[00:59:06.533 --> 00:59:09.354]  So he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[00:59:11.889 --> 00:59:15.873]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[00:59:16.253 --> 00:59:18.335]  We normally sell for $249, it's a great deal.
[00:59:18.936 --> 00:59:21.298]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:22.739]  It's $127.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:27.243]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[00:59:28.103 --> 00:59:29.283]  And I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[00:59:29.343 --> 00:59:31.284]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[00:59:31.324 --> 00:59:32.445]  I mean, I'm all for great deals.
[00:59:32.605 --> 00:59:33.645]  This is insane.
[00:59:34.005 --> 00:59:35.766]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[00:59:36.186 --> 00:59:38.167]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family.
[00:59:38.187 --> 00:59:39.567]  Get the best, the best deal.
[00:59:39.948 --> 00:59:42.168]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[00:59:42.268 --> 00:59:42.789]  It's amazing.
[00:59:42.869 --> 00:59:48.911]  Alexa Pure Pro at Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:54.594 --> 01:00:00.502]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:14.642 --> 01:00:18.683]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.443 --> 01:00:20.904]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:21.144 --> 01:00:22.304]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.824 --> 01:00:27.566]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:33.767]  Well, one of my favorite guests, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, is going to be with us coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:35.448 --> 01:00:36.188]  But I gotta tell you,
[01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:41.150]  Evil is just coming out of the woodwork right now.
[01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:42.390]  But so is good.
[01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:44.371]  Nationalism, rebirth of Christianity.
[01:00:45.211 --> 01:00:49.613]  All over the world, nationalists are winning and are ahead in the polls.
[01:00:49.753 --> 01:00:51.613]  So, Pastor Brown has just toured Europe.
[01:00:51.693 --> 01:00:52.894]  He said it's on fire.
[01:00:53.254 --> 01:00:56.595]  I watched some of the videos on his website over the weekend after he told me about it.
[01:00:56.675 --> 01:00:57.195]  It's amazing.
[01:00:57.215 --> 01:01:00.616]  So we're going to get to all of that coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:01.297]  Some good news.
[01:01:01.317 --> 01:01:03.237]  And then our reporters are on the border.
[01:01:03.277 --> 01:01:04.098]  They're in Tijuana.
[01:01:04.398 --> 01:01:06.638]  They've already followed some amazing reports in fullwars.com.
[01:01:07.179 --> 01:01:08.079]  That is coming up.
[01:01:09.893 --> 01:01:14.079]  As well, but here's part of John Bowne's report that's very, very important.
[01:01:14.099 --> 01:01:15.301]  It's not the whole report, but it's part of it.
[01:01:15.581 --> 01:01:18.485]  China's baby DNA editing threatens humanity.
[01:01:18.505 --> 01:01:18.825]  Here it is.
[01:01:19.795 --> 01:01:29.099]  Dr. Lai Liangshui at the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health claim they're the first to successfully alter the genetic makeup of dogs.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.261]  This muscle is much stronger.
[01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:37.243]  They doubled the muscle mass of these beagles through the process of gene editing.
[01:01:37.283 --> 01:01:44.467]  We knocked out a gene which would ordinarily stop muscles from growing, so these dogs became much more muscular, Lai told us.
[01:01:44.867 --> 01:02:05.466]  Back in 1987, in a lab in Osaka, Japan, the discovery of a clustered regularly interspaced short alendromic repeats DNA sequence system, or what is more commonly known as CRISPR, sent shockwaves through the science community because of the chaotic modifications it could cause upon human DNA.
[01:02:05.606 --> 01:02:16.251]  And is there any way that you can encourage us to allow our compassionate evolution and our evolution of our moral conscience to evolve at the same rate as our technology?
[01:02:16.391 --> 01:02:23.794]  The only way we can proceed is really to have, you know, an open community of people where we invite everyone to get involved.
[01:02:24.195 --> 01:02:31.458]  It can't be just the elites doing something and everybody else, you know, sort of trying to figure it out and figure out how it's affecting them.
[01:02:31.778 --> 01:02:34.600]  I'm a believer in the precautionary principle, as I've just said.
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:39.644]  And I think we have to worry about possible consequences of things that we do.
[01:02:40.445 --> 01:02:46.590]  And the ability to edit our own genomes is one thing we ought to worry about.
[01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:52.554]  I'm not sure it's so much an ethical problem as a more practical problem.
[01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:54.236]  What would the consequences be?
[01:02:54.276 --> 01:02:55.717]  Would the consequences be bad?
[01:02:56.558 --> 01:02:57.718]  And they might be.
[01:02:58.699 --> 01:03:06.662]  Now, Chinese scientists at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen are attempting to create the first gene-edited babies.
[01:03:06.982 --> 01:03:16.925]  Utilizing CRISPR, they intend on eliminating a gene known as CCR5 and creating genetically modified babies resistant to HIV, smallpox, and cholera.
[01:03:17.245 --> 01:03:28.635]  It has surprised the scientific community itself even how rapidly it's been taken up and how what's what's amazing is the number of applications that people have come up with.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.123]  Scientists have already used CRISPR to engineer mosquitoes to resist malaria.
[01:03:34.523 --> 01:03:40.687]  It's also been used to create designer animals, goats with longer hair, and beagles with more muscle.
[01:03:40.767 --> 01:03:43.128]  But does the bad outweigh the good?
[01:03:43.468 --> 01:03:55.275]  Aside from the possibility of weakening humanity and making it more susceptible to cancer, for example, scientists worry that once a species is modified, it is changed forever.
[01:03:55.555 --> 01:04:02.800]  If our original mosquito was AA and our new mosquito was AB, where B is the anti-malaria gene, the babies should come out in four permutations.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.682]  AA, AB, AA, BA.
[01:04:06.842 --> 01:04:10.245]  Instead, with a new gene drive, they all came out AB.
[01:04:11.786 --> 01:04:13.927]  Biologically, that shouldn't even be possible.
[01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:21.152]  Gene drives are so effective that even an accidental release could change an entire species, and often very quickly.
[01:04:21.412 --> 01:04:26.856]  The other piece of bad news is that a gene drive might not stay confined to what we call the target species.
[01:04:27.616 --> 01:04:32.179]  That's because of gene flow, which is basically a fancy way of saying that neighboring species sometimes interbreed.
[01:04:32.579 --> 01:04:39.544]  The last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this, to genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive... Okay.
[01:04:40.705 --> 01:04:43.646]  The full report is on Infowars.com, but here's the bottom line.
[01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:46.528]  The Chi-Coms are the most godless, satanic group on earth.
[01:04:47.209 --> 01:04:53.413]  They are already bringing a social score out where you get basically rounded up and arrested if you're a Christian.
[01:04:53.793 --> 01:04:55.254]  So what are they going to put into this?
[01:04:55.314 --> 01:04:56.154]  These aren't humans.
[01:04:56.194 --> 01:04:57.035]  These are humanoids.
[01:04:57.415 --> 01:05:01.378]  We'll talk about it with Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown on a lot of other subjects straight ahead.
[01:05:10.476 --> 01:05:15.738]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[01:05:16.759 --> 01:05:23.641]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:05:23.901 --> 01:05:26.342]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:05:26.983 --> 01:05:27.863]  I want to keep going.
[01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:32.205]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:34.226]  I want to push all the way.
[01:05:35.206 --> 01:05:36.147]  I've committed to do that.
[01:05:36.287 --> 01:05:37.087]  I've prayed for that.
[01:05:37.647 --> 01:05:39.268]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[01:05:39.308 --> 01:05:42.330]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:45.631]  I will give the total sacrifice.
[01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:47.312]  I will never falter.
[01:05:47.872 --> 01:05:49.954]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:05:50.234 --> 01:05:50.934]  I physically will.
[01:05:51.374 --> 01:05:58.158]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at FullMoreStore.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:06:09.258 --> 01:06:14.606]  When I grow up... No, when I grow up, I want to see the Globals kicked off this planet.
[01:06:32.797 --> 01:06:38.827]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:39.227 --> 01:06:41.351]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.163 --> 01:06:46.544]  Well, I could not think of a better guest to come on with us right now.
[01:06:46.624 --> 01:06:55.388]  He was born and raised in South Africa, traveled here with his wife and family in the 1980s, has one of the most successful true Bible-believing churches in the U.S.
[01:06:55.468 --> 01:06:58.309]  and huge outreach globally, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:05.392]  And he's with us for the rest of the hour, KillingUncleSamBook.com, his new book, Revival.com.
[01:07:05.992 --> 01:07:09.454]  He has been in Europe and seen how literally on fire
[01:07:10.174 --> 01:07:10.494]  They are.
[01:07:10.534 --> 01:07:22.082]  I saw some of the videos of thousands, tens of thousands, where he was going out and speaking with Christ and with nationalism and with the understanding of the attack that's going on.
[01:07:22.602 --> 01:07:25.324]  Europe is just as awake as Eastern Europe from people that I know that live there.
[01:07:25.344 --> 01:07:30.107]  Paul Watson lives in Europe most of the year, lives in Spain now because England's collapsed so bad.
[01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:36.642]  I wanted to get Pastor Brown on as he just got back to talk about what he's witnessed, what he's seen.
[01:07:36.682 --> 01:07:43.051]  But first, just in general, he predicted South Africa taking the white farmers' land, even land they'd recently purchased.
[01:07:44.011 --> 01:07:44.752]  It's now happening.
[01:07:44.792 --> 01:07:53.578]  He predicted so much and now they've announced in thousands of newspapers, hundreds of thousands of Brits to get microchips to be able to bank or work in government.
[01:07:54.019 --> 01:08:05.847]  And now other countries, Sweden wants you to get a chip and thousands have to get on the train or bus and now they're pushing it here and total surveillance and human editing and oh China had clones years ago of humans.
[01:08:06.428 --> 01:08:10.351]  It's all coming out in the open and two different Netflix shows
[01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:14.531]  Promoting pedophilia.
[01:08:15.471 --> 01:08:16.872]  One movie, one show are out right now.
[01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.694]  Five-year-olds are being taught they're in other sex.
[01:08:21.495 --> 01:08:27.138]  Google's coming out with AI where you can't even type in the browser or on a droid.
[01:08:28.239 --> 01:08:30.180]  Just like you have an iPhone, it won't let you send cuss words.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.842]  Well, now it's not gonna let you say he or she.
[01:08:33.882 --> 01:08:34.543]  That's Reuters!
[01:08:34.803 --> 01:08:39.085]  Fearful of bias, Google blocks gender-based pronouns from new AI tool.
[01:08:39.646 --> 01:08:39.786]  See?
[01:08:41.721 --> 01:08:43.262]  So people can't even write anymore.
[01:08:43.362 --> 01:08:45.824]  They know how to do emojis and type, but it won't let you.
[01:08:46.385 --> 01:08:50.829]  Just like China is working with Google, where you can't send emojis of the Taiwanese flag.
[01:08:51.209 --> 01:08:52.310]  It's all here.
[01:08:52.850 --> 01:09:00.216]  Everything we've talked about confirmed, but I'd like to say, being on air 23 years, that oh, I was first to talk about this.
[01:09:00.677 --> 01:09:02.238]  But you know where I heard all this?
[01:09:02.658 --> 01:09:03.039]  Was at
[01:09:04.127 --> 01:09:07.969]  We have evangelical churches that we went to when I was a child.
[01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:12.051]  We also went to Baptist churches and, you know, go to Methodist churches, went to family churches.
[01:09:12.091 --> 01:09:12.952]  We'd go to different churches.
[01:09:13.352 --> 01:09:15.153]  But I was in evangelical churches more than anything.
[01:09:15.173 --> 01:09:17.414]  And I'd sit there and think, this sounds like science fiction.
[01:09:17.474 --> 01:09:19.335]  But I had a spiritual experience.
[01:09:19.835 --> 01:09:20.656]  I knew God was real.
[01:09:20.676 --> 01:09:23.437]  And as you get older, you have more experiences, you know, just how real God is.
[01:09:23.697 --> 01:09:26.839]  And the whole spiritual world, that the enemy knows that, is trying to keep you from it.
[01:09:27.039 --> 01:09:29.240]  There aren't really atheists high level, let me tell you.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.581]  They're devil worshipers.
[01:09:31.161 --> 01:09:35.085]  And that's coming out, because the devil's biggest trick is saying he doesn't exist.
[01:09:35.125 --> 01:09:36.347]  They want power over you.
[01:09:36.647 --> 01:09:49.140]  And now, everything foretold, not by me 23 years ago, not by those churches 40 years ago, 45 years ago, no, what's in the Bible, it's all happening exactly like it said.
[01:09:50.117 --> 01:09:51.478]  And it gives me chills.
[01:09:52.078 --> 01:09:53.879]  Pastor Brown, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:58.481]  I want to talk about prophecy and where we are historically and how important all this is.
[01:09:58.501 --> 01:10:04.604]  And then I want to get into the good news that when the great evil comes in, though, that will cause this great awakening, won't it?
[01:10:06.613 --> 01:10:10.655]  Yes, first of all, again, I was watching you before the previous hour.
[01:10:10.675 --> 01:10:11.575]  You're on fire.
[01:10:11.935 --> 01:10:18.739]  People might not understand your passion, Alex, but when you know all these things, then you know you can make this stuff up.
[01:10:19.259 --> 01:10:20.639]  We're living in the final hour.
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.681]  The final grains of sand are coming through the hourglass.
[01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:28.973]  As you know, all that has to happen for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing.
[01:10:29.053 --> 01:10:30.854]  So your voice is important.
[01:10:30.915 --> 01:10:32.796]  That's obviously why they try to shut you up.
[01:10:33.336 --> 01:10:39.699]  But they're not going to shut you up, and they're not going to shut anyone up that will just stand up for righteousness and will proclaim.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:45.082]  And if something happens to us, there'll be many that will come on behind us and take our place.
[01:10:45.142 --> 01:10:49.945]  So, you know, it's like the Gideons 300, you know, the army of 300.
[01:10:52.322 --> 01:10:54.144]  Look, we're living in the final hour.
[01:10:54.224 --> 01:10:57.266]  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see what's taking place.
[01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:01.910]  The censorship, the corruption in the highest levels of government.
[01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:06.613]  And as you said something which is so profound, there's no atheists.
[01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:09.155]  These people at the highest levels worship Lucifer.
[01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:11.617]  And that's what people don't actually understand.
[01:11:11.937 --> 01:11:16.441]  That the agenda is actually driven really from the pits of hell.
[01:11:17.344 --> 01:11:27.568]  The only solution, as far as what I can see, obviously we've got to get godly people in the government and people that will do good, but is the gospel of Jesus Christ being proclaimed?
[01:11:27.948 --> 01:11:31.269]  And people, you know, putting their life on the line.
[01:11:31.649 --> 01:11:35.991]  You know, the early church, the church was built on the blood of the martyrs.
[01:11:36.471 --> 01:11:40.413]  So we have to have radical people that will stand up in this hour.
[01:11:40.853 --> 01:11:43.554]  So that's one of the things that I felt in my heart to do.
[01:11:44.748 --> 01:11:45.389]  What's going on?
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.461]  To tell you what I saw.
[01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:03.663]  It was amazing to see, actual fact, what they are doing.
[01:12:04.023 --> 01:12:07.025]  If people think, you know, maybe the governments are corrupt, but they are.
[01:12:07.305 --> 01:12:11.808]  There's an army of believers that is being raised up all across Europe.
[01:12:12.188 --> 01:12:13.408]  And they're behind the scenes.
[01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.609]  They're in the Ukraine.
[01:12:14.829 --> 01:12:15.630]  They're in Russia.
[01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:17.451]  They're in Bulgaria.
[01:12:17.491 --> 01:12:18.471]  They're in Hungary.
[01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:20.332]  They're in Bratislava.
[01:12:20.352 --> 01:12:22.274]  They're in Finland, even.
[01:12:22.694 --> 01:12:23.174]  Sweden.
[01:12:23.454 --> 01:12:23.955]  Norway.
[01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:24.415]  I mean,
[01:12:25.075 --> 01:12:33.142]  Well, it actually is very encouraging when you travel and then you meet people at the grassroots level and they made a decision.
[01:12:33.202 --> 01:12:35.144]  We're not going out quietly.
[01:12:35.504 --> 01:12:39.647]  So, here's the thing I think that the globalists have underestimated.
[01:12:39.728 --> 01:12:45.032]  First of all, they think that Christianity is just something that's just somebody's idea.
[01:12:45.472 --> 01:12:48.835]  Number one, they think that it can be snuffed out.
[01:12:48.935 --> 01:12:51.317]  They think that the Holy Spirit doesn't exist.
[01:12:53.081 --> 01:12:56.363]  Of course, you know that the Holy Spirit is omnipresent.
[01:12:56.764 --> 01:12:57.584]  He's everywhere.
[01:12:57.804 --> 01:13:02.227]  He's omnipresent, He's omnipotent, and He's omniscient, and He's God.
[01:13:03.954 --> 01:13:21.724]  Wherever people are on the earth that cry out, He comes and reveals Himself to them, and they're from every background of society, young and old, and then God... Let's expand on this because, and the Bible says this too, but as the spirit of evil accelerates and gets more powerful, I can feel the Holy Spirit getting more powerful.
[01:13:21.784 --> 01:13:24.286]  As you said last time we met in private, I can't even handle it.
[01:13:24.586 --> 01:13:25.846]  Like, I used to sleep so good.
[01:13:25.906 --> 01:13:29.128]  Now I'm waking up at 2 or 3 in the morning, like, just like, stop them!
[01:13:29.388 --> 01:13:29.809]  Fight them!
[01:13:30.069 --> 01:13:31.129]  There's something I'm supposed to do.
[01:13:31.169 --> 01:13:31.770]  You're like,
[01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:39.537]  Think about it, and then it keeps coming to me and it's something I'm not doing on air because you kind of feel humble and then you don't want to do it, but I know it's true.
[01:13:39.577 --> 01:13:40.758]  We have to call on God.
[01:13:41.118 --> 01:13:41.979]  We have to pray.
[01:13:42.299 --> 01:13:44.301]  We have to realize it is an evil force we're against.
[01:13:44.522 --> 01:13:47.244]  We're not going to be able to beat it, and that's what the Holy Spirit's been telling me.
[01:13:47.444 --> 01:13:50.447]  I know that's a very simple statement, but it's also a very profound statement.
[01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:51.148]  Can you speak to that?
[01:13:52.642 --> 01:14:00.411]  Well, first of all, when Jesus walked the earth, he told the disciples, he said, I'm going to go away, but I will not leave you comfortless.
[01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:02.774]  He said, I'm going to send you another comforter.
[01:14:03.114 --> 01:14:05.276]  He said, he's with you now, but he's going to be in you.
[01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:08.020]  And you can read about that John 14, 15, and 16.
[01:14:09.521 --> 01:14:18.928]  And then right at the resurrection, just before he left, he told the disciples, he said, to go tarry at Jerusalem, and he said, you'll receive power to be witnesses.
[01:14:19.329 --> 01:14:27.095]  So, I mean, the disciples could have said, Lord, but we already, we did what you told us, we went in your name, we cast out devils, we laid hands on the sick, but he said,
[01:14:27.775 --> 01:14:29.096]  The Holy Spirit's going to come.
[01:14:29.376 --> 01:14:40.240]  The promise of the Father, which was actually announced by John the Baptist, who said, I'm baptized with water, but there's coming one after me, talking of Jesus, who will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:47.303]  So it's that fire that comes into the life of a believer that stirs that believer up to do the extraordinary.
[01:14:47.703 --> 01:14:54.011]  As you look through the Old Testament, you see Moses couldn't deliver the children of Israel until he had a burning bush experience.
[01:14:54.392 --> 01:15:02.983]  Then you look at the others that were used of God, from David or... I mean, we can go through all the Bible characters, but go to Elijah.
[01:15:03.283 --> 01:15:05.526]  Elijah outran a chariot of horses.
[01:15:05.886 --> 01:15:06.026]  So...
[01:15:06.888 --> 01:15:19.789]  I mean, the rains came, he took on the prophets of Baal, Elisha followed in his footstep, had double the portion that Elijah had, and so Jesus told his disciples, go tarry at Jerusalem.
[01:15:23.075 --> 01:15:23.655]  It's amazing.
[01:15:23.715 --> 01:15:26.076]  We're going to go to break and talk more about this.
[01:15:26.136 --> 01:15:28.157]  But the enemy talks about this.
[01:15:28.678 --> 01:15:33.140]  They know that when they come in to take over, they know that it's going to ignite this.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:34.900]  And that's why they're getting so scared.
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.961]  And as you said, you were just in 16 cities.
[01:15:37.662 --> 01:15:41.443]  Pastor, I want to come back and talk about the good news of the nationalism.
[01:15:41.483 --> 01:15:43.364]  Marie Le Pen in the lead in France.
[01:15:44.705 --> 01:15:46.305]  Italy electing a patriot.
[01:15:46.586 --> 01:15:48.747]  Romania, Hungary, Poland on fire.
[01:15:49.627 --> 01:15:51.448]  The UK fighting back.
[01:15:52.268 --> 01:15:55.229]  Merkel and her party being voted out of power.
[01:15:55.469 --> 01:16:01.490]  We'll talk about it all with a major true barnstorming man of God who just came back from Europe.
[01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:06.551]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:16:07.051 --> 01:16:09.812]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:16.153]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:16:16.613 --> 01:16:19.374]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:16:20.114 --> 01:16:23.556]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:16:23.936 --> 01:16:30.018]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:35.381]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:16:36.121 --> 01:16:39.542]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:46.583]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:16:47.243 --> 01:16:51.944]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:16:52.484 --> 01:16:57.565]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:16:58.145 --> 01:17:02.126]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:17:02.694 --> 01:17:08.618]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[01:17:08.818 --> 01:17:14.982]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way.

[01:18:12.183 --> 01:18:16.726]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:18:17.146 --> 01:18:20.209]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.

[01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:08.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.445 --> 01:20:27.769]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:28.249]  Live!
[01:20:28.269 --> 01:20:34.713]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:39.396 --> 01:20:44.017]  You know, Austin, Texas is really a conservative libertarian town.
[01:20:44.378 --> 01:20:46.078]  We've had election fraud for 30, 40 years.
[01:20:46.098 --> 01:20:46.858]  Totally proven.
[01:20:47.518 --> 01:20:50.939]  Once the Democrats take control of a city, you don't have any real voting anymore.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.840]  That's why they only have blue pockets, though, where they've stolen elections.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.061]  We've got internal polls, other numbers.
[01:20:57.233 --> 01:21:02.860]  The Republicans really won the Senate, which they did, and the House, but you saw the election fraud everywhere.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.525]  And now, just as Europe was hit with 15 million military-age men, we're being hit.
[01:21:08.086 --> 01:21:11.650]  And they are kidnapping kids and smuggling them in and using them as human shields.
[01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:13.432]  All last hour, I showed all that.
[01:21:14.867 --> 01:21:19.151]  And the UN involved in child sex trafficking as their business, not even a side business.
[01:21:19.591 --> 01:21:22.393]  And Pastor Rodney Howard Brown has traveled the entire world.
[01:21:23.354 --> 01:21:28.439]  He's one of the top real evangelical pastors that goes forth to all the four corners of the planet.
[01:21:29.159 --> 01:21:34.424]  And he is bringing us very positive news, very uplifting news.
[01:21:34.984 --> 01:21:35.885]  Very good news.
[01:21:35.905 --> 01:21:43.110]  We're going to run some B-roll of this that's got some music over it, but he's going to describe what you're seeing for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[01:21:43.631 --> 01:21:49.535]  And this dovetails, I trust, verify, of the Nationalist, of the Christian Revival.
[01:21:50.575 --> 01:21:57.339]  In Europe, in Brazil, everywhere where you can have real elections, people are voting against the New World Order.
[01:21:57.379 --> 01:22:04.083]  But that's why the censorship, that's why the oppression, that's why the targeting of the children young to screw them up before they can think.
[01:22:04.484 --> 01:22:06.345]  That's why these bullies target our youth.
[01:22:06.585 --> 01:22:09.066]  So, Pastor Brown, we've got a longer segment coming up.
[01:22:09.086 --> 01:22:10.507]  It's about seven minutes left in this one.
[01:22:11.288 --> 01:22:16.051]  Please give us this great report and thanks for sharing your time with us at Revival.com.
[01:22:17.668 --> 01:22:24.673]  All right, well, here's what I failed to do, because without the help of the Holy Spirit, we will not be able to combat what is taking place.
[01:22:25.013 --> 01:22:26.334]  I don't care who people are.
[01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:28.515]  You could be a politician, a preacher.
[01:22:28.616 --> 01:22:33.379]  If you do not have the fire of the Holy Ghost, you will not make it in the hour that's coming.
[01:22:33.859 --> 01:22:34.099]  Fact.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.241]  You might not like what I'm saying, but I'm just telling you.
[01:22:37.542 --> 01:22:39.463]  They're going to ship your saddle home.
[01:22:39.863 --> 01:22:42.505]  You either get on fire for God or forget about it.
[01:22:42.685 --> 01:22:44.266]  This is not the time to play games.
[01:22:44.686 --> 01:22:51.871]  So what I felt to do, Alex, rather than go and try to do some big arenas, was just to go to churches and use them like an upper room.
[01:22:52.311 --> 01:22:57.555]  One night meeting and get believed for 100 leaders in each city.
[01:22:57.855 --> 01:23:00.597]  I'm going to go to 300 cities in the next two years.
[01:23:00.937 --> 01:23:08.242]  That's 30,000 leaders to get ignited with a purpose, whether they're business people, politicians or pastors.
[01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:12.425]  And so we started we started in Stockholm, Sweden.
[01:23:14.103 --> 01:23:18.505]  On the first night from there, well, Stockholm was a great meeting.
[01:23:18.545 --> 01:23:20.126]  People came so hungry for God.
[01:23:20.607 --> 01:23:24.449]  I met people there that were just, and of course I gave altar calls every night.
[01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:25.670]  People got saved.
[01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:29.332]  So you can see I'm using a church, 630 in attendance.
[01:23:29.833 --> 01:23:34.516]  That night, 223 people came forward in the altar call to recommit their life to the Lord.
[01:23:34.536 --> 01:23:37.838]  And then we mobilized leaders right after that and spoke to them.
[01:23:38.358 --> 01:23:42.201]  So 103 ministers and leaders, some of them business leaders,
[01:23:42.701 --> 01:23:46.903]  Then we went to Vestfossen, Norway, which, that's another thing I'll tell you about.
[01:23:46.923 --> 01:23:49.583]  502, that was an old paper mill.
[01:23:50.064 --> 01:23:54.765]  182 salvations, and that is very historic for what happened in Norway.
[01:23:55.105 --> 01:23:56.686]  104 ministers and leaders mobilized.
[01:23:57.066 --> 01:24:02.508]  Then I traveled north to a place called Alta, where the Sami people, they follow the reindeer.
[01:24:03.128 --> 01:24:04.870]  It's so remote in the northern part.
[01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:08.033]  We only had 132 there, but the tribal people were there.
[01:24:08.053 --> 01:24:08.853]  Beautiful dress.
[01:24:09.254 --> 01:24:10.435]  They actually cooked for me.
[01:24:11.295 --> 01:24:12.156]  68 people got saved.
[01:24:12.476 --> 01:24:14.858]  They said they're going to visit all their villagers.
[01:24:15.118 --> 01:24:16.680]  25 ministers and leaders mobilized there.
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:18.101]  Went to Helsinki.
[01:24:18.461 --> 01:24:19.322]  Met with pastors.
[01:24:19.402 --> 01:24:21.344]  Met with people in the Finnish government.
[01:24:21.844 --> 01:24:22.965]  That ran for president.
[01:24:22.985 --> 01:24:25.586]  580 in attendance in that meeting.
[01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:28.747]  And then gave the altar call.
[01:24:28.767 --> 01:24:30.708]  123 people gave their lives to Christ.
[01:24:31.169 --> 01:24:33.009]  And then we spoke to leaders.
[01:24:33.450 --> 01:24:35.070]  Right after that, mobilized them.
[01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:36.411]  140 leaders.
[01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:38.112]  Just giving them a mandate.
[01:24:38.132 --> 01:24:39.913]  You've got to shake your nation.
[01:24:40.193 --> 01:24:41.013]  Bratislava.
[01:24:41.794 --> 01:24:42.934]  55 churches coming together.
[01:24:42.954 --> 01:24:43.534]  2200, I think.
[01:24:45.215 --> 01:24:48.778]  In attendance, the altar call that night was epic.
[01:24:48.798 --> 01:24:50.719]  2,250 in attendance.
[01:24:50.759 --> 01:24:52.420]  They rented that arena themselves.
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:56.482]  They were so hungry, they said if we had more time, we would have been in a bigger arena.
[01:24:56.803 --> 01:24:58.624]  But I said, no, no, let's just use churches.
[01:24:59.044 --> 01:25:00.665]  But Alex, the people are so hungry.
[01:25:00.725 --> 01:25:02.546]  People came on buses from everywhere.
[01:25:02.987 --> 01:25:07.890]  The altar call that night, as you can see when I gave the call, was
[01:25:10.433 --> 01:25:13.154]  1,340 people came forward to give their lives to Christ.
[01:25:13.234 --> 01:25:17.555]  270 ministers and leaders, which I got to speak to and talk to them directly.
[01:25:17.855 --> 01:25:18.995]  Then we went to Budapest.
[01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:19.795]  Unexpected.
[01:25:19.835 --> 01:25:21.396]  I'll tell you about it when we finish the clip.
[01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:24.176]  There was 12,000 jammed into this place.
[01:25:24.596 --> 01:25:27.617]  Alex, this church I actually dedicated 20 years ago.
[01:25:27.937 --> 01:25:32.818]  And when we, when the segment finished plays, I'll tell you about this church, what they're doing in Hungary.
[01:25:32.838 --> 01:25:33.458]  It's epic.
[01:25:33.778 --> 01:25:35.379]  He has 70,000 members.
[01:25:35.779 --> 01:25:37.039]  This is a radical church.
[01:25:37.817 --> 01:25:39.658]  Radical, radical, radical church.
[01:25:39.758 --> 01:25:42.220]  And this really scares Soros and these other devils.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.662]  Yeah, kicked him out of Hungary.
[01:25:46.262 --> 01:25:50.184]  They got a newspaper, they got a 25-hour television network, news.
[01:25:50.625 --> 01:25:54.367]  We went to Kisunau, Moldova, which is very poor, Alex.
[01:25:54.387 --> 01:25:59.249]  They came out of communism, 385 people gave their lives to Christ, 280 ministers.
[01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:02.311]  So hungry, so desperate, asking me, what can we do?
[01:26:02.772 --> 01:26:03.372]  What can we do?
[01:26:03.412 --> 01:26:05.013]  We went on to Sofia, Bulgaria.
[01:26:05.714 --> 01:26:10.220]  805 in attendance, and then when I gave the altar call, you could see what happened.
[01:26:10.681 --> 01:26:13.485]  People flooded down to give their lives to Christ, just weeping.
[01:26:14.146 --> 01:26:15.989]  150 ministers and leaders mobilized.
[01:26:16.801 --> 01:26:20.425]  Then from there on to Bologna, Italy, which he was a little nervous.
[01:26:20.445 --> 01:26:24.369]  He didn't know if anybody would show up, but I've already done meetings in Italy.
[01:26:24.469 --> 01:26:28.593]  460, packed the place, standing room only, 168 salvations.
[01:26:29.094 --> 01:26:31.737]  And then we spoke to leaders, 140 leaders.
[01:26:32.057 --> 01:26:34.239]  I bring them all front, talk to them, give them a mandate.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:35.781]  On to Hanau, Germany.
[01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:40.717]  Which, that was amazing, what happened in, the Germans are so hungry.
[01:26:41.158 --> 01:26:50.131]  There was standing Ramondi in that building, 558 people there, and then 304 people came in the altar call to give their life to Christ, or come back to the Lord.
[01:26:50.771 --> 01:26:52.354]  165 ministers and leaders mobilized there.
[01:26:53.556 --> 01:26:54.677]  People are desperate, man.
[01:26:54.937 --> 01:26:59.600]  From there to Zurich, Switzerland, which was the biggest crowd that church had ever had in 30 years.
[01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:02.663]  And we jammed them in there, standing in a money.
[01:27:02.683 --> 01:27:06.606]  210 people came forward to give their life to Christ or recommit their life.
[01:27:06.626 --> 01:27:08.227]  110 ministers mobilized.
[01:27:08.607 --> 01:27:09.488]  Then on to Paris.
[01:27:09.568 --> 01:27:10.609]  Paris blew me away.
[01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:12.450]  I had a meeting with pastors.
[01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:14.331]  They were so hungry for God.
[01:27:14.912 --> 01:27:16.793]  Over a thousand in attendance in Paris.
[01:27:16.953 --> 01:27:18.414]  This is in a church.
[01:27:18.494 --> 01:27:19.695]  185 salvations.
[01:27:20.136 --> 01:27:20.636]  People just
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.863]  We're asking us, what can we do to shake France?
[01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:29.588]  People desperate for God, just realize that without God's help, they can't, their nation's gone.
[01:27:29.868 --> 01:27:30.629]  They realize that.
[01:27:31.049 --> 01:27:35.854]  And that the only hope, on from there, we went to Amsterdam, Holland, to our church there.
[01:27:35.874 --> 01:27:37.135]  We have a church there in the morning.
[01:27:37.515 --> 01:27:41.059]  And then the night was a neutral venue, which again, packed out.
[01:27:41.419 --> 01:27:44.142]  People so hungry to see Holland set on fire.
[01:27:44.562 --> 01:27:48.724]  And again, you had 14,000 at one, and I've seen other videos when you're in the U.S., tens of thousands.
[01:27:49.244 --> 01:28:03.469]  The point is, and we'll come back and talk about this, talking to the people, they're aware of globalism, the New World Order, Soros, and you were confirming on the phone to me this weekend, we're texting, how on fire they are, and how this just verifies what we're seeing in the news, versus
[01:28:04.329 --> 01:28:09.012]  We hear, oh, there's not really a Christian awakening in Europe, or in Eastern Europe, or in Russia.
[01:28:09.032 --> 01:28:17.258]  I don't know if you've been to Russia yet, but I talk to people that have, and I also read the reports that this is a big Christian revival there.
[01:28:18.719 --> 01:28:19.700]  No doubt.
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:26.045]  For anybody to not realize that, I'm just telling you, the last meeting we did in Dublin, Ireland, which was just epic.
[01:28:26.665 --> 01:28:29.387]  I mean, I was like shocked at what happened in Ireland.
[01:28:29.947 --> 01:28:32.089]  And so much so, we're going back, we're going to go
[01:28:33.068 --> 01:28:33.448]  Look at that.
[01:28:33.488 --> 01:28:35.229]  That was in the National Boxing Arena.
[01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:36.589]  Over a thousand people there.
[01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:40.371]  The altar calls over 600 people and people being mobilized.
[01:28:40.391 --> 01:28:41.771]  They want to see Ireland shaking.
[01:28:42.011 --> 01:28:42.631]  Stay right there.
[01:28:42.652 --> 01:28:43.372]  We gotta go to break.
[01:28:43.492 --> 01:28:46.213]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown just on his back from his mission to Europe.
[01:28:46.753 --> 01:28:48.273]  And the key word is mobilize.
[01:28:48.934 --> 01:28:52.635]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[01:28:52.955 --> 01:28:55.576]  The enemy's operating system is Lucifer.
[01:28:56.036 --> 01:28:57.077]  There's no escaping it.
[01:28:57.557 --> 01:28:59.257]  You've got to choose a side now, folks.
[01:28:59.537 --> 01:29:00.818]  We're fighting Satanist.
[01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:10.360]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.941]  And listen, everybody's got a heart.

[01:29:19.005 --> 01:29:20.086]  So, if you have a heart,

[01:29:54.042 --> 01:29:57.545]  It's got the properly formulated type of CoQ10 and more.
[01:29:57.866 --> 01:29:59.447]  It is Xtend-A-Wise.
[01:29:59.487 --> 01:30:01.670]  Now available at mfulwardslife.com.
[01:30:08.083 --> 01:30:12.268]  The Border Patrol warned Texans about militias stopping migrant caravan.
[01:30:12.488 --> 01:30:16.132]  We've got way more than just the 5,000 troops that Trump talked about.
[01:30:16.152 --> 01:30:20.177]  We've got video that's on DrudgeReport.com of army tanks being sent down there.
[01:30:20.277 --> 01:30:22.940]  Abrams tanks, command vehicles, all of it.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.622]  I think Trump's got this handled.
[01:30:24.662 --> 01:30:28.166]  People have a right to go down there, but I'm just saying I smell a big fat chance
[01:30:28.186 --> 01:30:32.627]  Yeah, I've even been talking to liberals here in New York City and they don't seem to like this.
[01:30:32.647 --> 01:30:33.188]  They smell a rat.
[01:30:44.331 --> 01:30:59.146]  And it just seems very curious that thousands of people spontaneously rent some 18 wheelers together, I guess they all pool their money, and they drive, and then walk for the cameras, and then drive, and then walk for the cameras, on their way to Mexico.
[01:30:59.226 --> 01:31:04.231]  I mean, even the left is saying, this really looks like it's for optics, and if it is,
[01:31:04.851 --> 01:31:12.276]  Just for optics, that is brutally sinister and it shows how, I don't know, how evil some of these people on the left can be.
[01:31:12.316 --> 01:31:26.624]  Because are you trying to set up a scenario where hundreds of migrants are pushing the fences and they get crushed and maybe there's a photo of a dead kid or something or a military guy shooting at people who are trying to, you know, mob him or something?
[01:31:26.845 --> 01:31:32.308]  Are you trying to get some picture to change the election and happily sacrificing hundreds of people?
[01:31:33.058 --> 01:31:35.460]  Well, I mean, you're gonna put Satan out of work.
[01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:39.123]  You know what this reminds me of is Fast and Furious, which isn't controversial.
[01:31:39.163 --> 01:31:49.310]  Everyone knows that, what was it, Eric Holder and Obama were caught sending guns down to Mexico so they could make guns look bad, get them in the hands of cartels, and they'll go, look at all these AKs, they killed tons of people.
[01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:51.812]  I mean, no matter how bad the right gets,
[01:31:52.052 --> 01:31:57.694]  You never hear about them wanting to use human beings as fodder, where they're happily risking lives for optics.
[01:31:57.894 --> 01:32:00.055]  I mean, this is Stalin in a nutshell.
[01:32:00.235 --> 01:32:02.936]  This is his mass starvations and mass murder.
[01:32:03.016 --> 01:32:04.457]  This is the way communists think.
[01:32:04.497 --> 01:32:05.878]  They don't think about human beings.
[01:32:05.918 --> 01:32:08.439]  They see humans as just sort of like ephemera.
[01:32:08.579 --> 01:32:11.180]  Just a big pile of wasps they can send somewhere.
[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:13.601]  Or a dam they can blow and have it just flood.
[01:32:14.541 --> 01:32:15.482]  And the UN admits that.
[01:32:15.522 --> 01:32:25.089]  They say they want to destroy borders, collapse the evil capitalist system, so we'll accept the socialist utopia with rich people like Soros and the Chaikoms tax-exempt living in palaces.
[01:32:25.269 --> 01:32:26.550]  Dismantle capitalism.
[01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:32.354]  You know, when I was a young man in the 80s, that was what the crazy, radical nuts said, and it was kind of cool.
[01:32:32.454 --> 01:32:34.275]  Like, oh, this guy's a communist.
[01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:35.456]  That's kind of a freaky thing.
[01:32:36.156 --> 01:32:37.577]  Um, now it's mainstream.
[01:32:37.617 --> 01:32:41.920]  I think something like more than 50% of people in the DNC would prefer socialism.
[01:32:42.681 --> 01:32:46.404]  It's 50 plus percent of millennials want communism or socialism.
[01:32:46.484 --> 01:32:48.465]  And they always use Northern Europe as an example.
[01:32:48.745 --> 01:32:51.487]  Northern Europe made its money when it was free market.
[01:32:51.587 --> 01:32:54.550]  It is now literally spending its parents' money.
[01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:55.450]  It's going bankrupt.
[01:32:55.951 --> 01:32:56.891]  Fully plummeting.
[01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:09.038]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:37.183 --> 01:33:41.644]  Everybody knows that I'm pretty sick of the fake Russia investigation, even though I've been in the middle of it.
[01:33:42.904 --> 01:33:45.625]  And I try to ignore it, but lately you can't.
[01:33:46.185 --> 01:33:55.047]  Because it's been all over the news that the grand jury asked people about me, and I'm not at liberty to get to it yet, but
[01:33:57.082 --> 01:33:58.203]  They've tried to set me up.
[01:33:58.443 --> 01:33:59.384]  It's unbelievable.
[01:33:59.784 --> 01:34:09.894]  But I can tell you, for everybody in the world and God, that I have had zero connection to the Russian government or money from Russians or anything.
[01:34:10.194 --> 01:34:11.215]  It's all pure bull.
[01:34:12.536 --> 01:34:21.764]  And I remember Roger Stone not being able to get a hold of Assange and me getting mad at Assange and saying, why do you not come on our shows but you go on the New York Times' TV show?
[01:34:21.824 --> 01:34:22.405]  Are you an idiot?
[01:34:24.349 --> 01:34:32.955]  So the claims that Roger got this stuff, or the claims that he did it with Dr. Corsi, I was involved in all of that at the time.
[01:34:33.676 --> 01:34:34.857]  With Corsi and Stone.
[01:34:35.137 --> 01:34:36.558]  Both of them have worked for him for worse.
[01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:39.540]  Stone does right now.
[01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:43.223]  I was squeezing them to get a hold of Assange.
[01:34:43.303 --> 01:34:43.983]  Everybody was.
[01:34:44.043 --> 01:34:45.885]  It's no crime to try to get WikiLeaks.
[01:34:47.210 --> 01:34:53.715]  But the idea that WikiLeaks is Russian and then by extent we are is just total baloney.
[01:34:54.516 --> 01:34:57.978]  But it doesn't matter because the new stuff coming out is just insane.
[01:34:58.619 --> 01:35:07.726]  Daily Caller, Jerome Corsi says he has defense agreement with Trump, received limited immunity from Mueller.
[01:35:10.188 --> 01:35:12.229]  This stuff of course is getting crazy.
[01:35:13.846 --> 01:35:15.567]  So, I'm going to try to get Roger to pop in later.
[01:35:15.607 --> 01:35:17.308]  I was just looking at this and it makes my head spin.
[01:35:18.288 --> 01:35:19.629]  But on to the good news here.
[01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:22.511]  Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown's here.
[01:35:23.271 --> 01:35:26.193]  He just went to Europe and had one of the biggest revivals in Europe he's ever had.
[01:35:26.213 --> 01:35:40.080]  I want to get the testimonials, what he saw on the ground, what he witnessed visiting 16 cities and all these countries from Poland or from Ireland to, I mean, everywhere basically.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.841]  So we'll be talking to him here in just a moment.
[01:35:43.018 --> 01:35:46.900]  Please don't forget that I need your prayers and I don't just count on them.
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:48.440]  I absolutely need them.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.040]  They're essential.
[01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:50.621]  So please keep praying for Infowars.
[01:35:51.681 --> 01:35:53.642]  I know taking on the Globals, we're going to get demonized.
[01:35:54.162 --> 01:35:54.983]  We're going to get attacked.
[01:35:55.003 --> 01:35:55.663]  We're going to get lied about.
[01:35:55.683 --> 01:35:59.064]  We're going to be a target because we really have reached billions of people.
[01:36:02.025 --> 01:36:08.368]  But at the same time, we also need financial support and I make it easy to do because whatever the best products are that people need,
[01:36:10.279 --> 01:36:14.120]  That help folks and that also help us fund our operation, I sell it.
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:20.681]  And if you take the Alexa Pure Pro Gravity-Fed Stainless Steel Water Filtration System, it's leading competitors aren't even as good.
[01:36:20.701 --> 01:36:22.101]  They're usually about $300 to $350.
[01:36:22.821 --> 01:36:24.221]  They're always a good deal at $249.
[01:36:24.622 --> 01:36:27.942]  I know the filters cost them $90-something to make.
[01:36:28.402 --> 01:36:29.762]  They ordered too many this year.
[01:36:30.303 --> 01:36:32.123]  They want to sell them so they don't have inventory problems.
[01:36:32.583 --> 01:36:33.563]  They have to pay tax on that.
[01:36:33.623 --> 01:36:35.263]  So they're selling them to us at cost.
[01:36:35.724 --> 01:36:37.304]  We make $30-something bucks on these.
[01:36:37.644 --> 01:36:38.224]  I've never
[01:36:39.991 --> 01:36:41.352]  I've never seen anything like this.
[01:36:41.412 --> 01:36:44.434]  This deal is beyond the best you'll ever find.
[01:36:45.175 --> 01:36:50.118]  Garbage units are 250 by competitors.
[01:36:50.398 --> 01:36:51.159]  This is the best.
[01:36:51.279 --> 01:36:52.199]  Alexa Pure Pro.

[01:37:13.177 --> 01:37:14.158]  We've got some backups now.
[01:37:14.718 --> 01:37:20.322]  And they've literally got CNN, because we ran their plates, or somebody did, driving around the parking lot stalking me.
[01:37:20.422 --> 01:37:21.903]  I've got PIs following me around.
[01:37:22.343 --> 01:37:22.663]  I've got...
[01:37:23.775 --> 01:37:26.578]  I'm not supposed to get into it all, but let's just say it's like a movie.
[01:37:26.958 --> 01:37:27.339]  It's fine.
[01:37:27.359 --> 01:37:31.803]  I mean, I'll be low on energy, and then somebody messes with me or something, and then I have all this energy.
[01:37:31.823 --> 01:37:34.987]  So, I don't want to say it's fun, but I'm built for this.
[01:37:35.467 --> 01:37:42.555]  And as long as you financially support us and pray for us, and spread the articles and the videos, we're going to maintain and continue on as long as God wants us to.

[01:37:51.948 --> 01:37:52.288]  Act now.
[01:37:52.328 --> 01:37:55.150]  You notice our Christmas ad has a cross on it.
[01:37:55.850 --> 01:38:02.634]  Funny how, you know, I didn't used to do that, but Christianity is under such persecution and they're taking Christianity out of
[01:38:04.352 --> 01:38:09.775]  The Google calendars, the Apple calendars, they're telling children they can't hand out Christmas cards at schools and all these lies.
[01:38:10.756 --> 01:38:11.897]  It's totally under assault.
[01:38:11.977 --> 01:38:19.001]  So more and more I bring my true relationship, not my religion, but my spirituality is real.
[01:38:19.041 --> 01:38:19.581]  God's real.
[01:38:19.842 --> 01:38:20.502]  The devil's real.
[01:38:20.602 --> 01:38:21.283]  I've experienced it.
[01:38:21.383 --> 01:38:21.783]  I know it.
[01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:23.144]  I've snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:38:23.184 --> 01:38:23.684]  I've seen it.
[01:38:24.004 --> 01:38:26.686]  I've seen things I won't even say on air because the media would use it against me.
[01:38:26.706 --> 01:38:28.167]  Believe me, this is a spiritual war.
[01:38:28.427 --> 01:38:30.128]  And you step into this, you're going to find out.
[01:38:30.208 --> 01:38:32.970]  And like Pastor Brown said, you better have the Holy Ghost.
[01:38:34.218 --> 01:38:41.347]  My only issue is, is that the fire, I kind of over-rev like a race car because I'm on fire all the time.
[01:38:41.808 --> 01:38:46.754]  And the more I see and the more I know, I just cannot believe other people are falling for this New World Order.
[01:38:47.235 --> 01:38:49.097]  So, Pastor, please continue with...
[01:38:50.479 --> 01:38:57.784]  Not just the big revival, but what the people said, what you heard, why globalism and its satanic system is in so much trouble from your amazing trip.
[01:38:57.804 --> 01:39:03.328]  And then everybody also should check out your amazing website, Revival.com or KillingUncleSamBook.com.
[01:39:03.588 --> 01:39:04.569]  Thank you again for joining us.
[01:39:06.351 --> 01:39:08.332]  All right, let me just say one thing.
[01:39:08.372 --> 01:39:11.314]  You know, what I did there was just go to churches.
[01:39:11.454 --> 01:39:15.436]  We've done arenas for years, and all I have from those is pictures.
[01:39:15.556 --> 01:39:23.981]  But local churches is where we have to build this engine room to take the city, to take a nation, as the church in Budapest is doing.
[01:39:24.422 --> 01:39:29.265]  So over the total trip was 23,200 attendants, 7,860 in the altar call, and 3,800 leaders mobilized.
[01:39:35.817 --> 01:39:41.379]  It doesn't take that many, Alex, if you can put the fire on just several.
[01:39:41.639 --> 01:39:43.900]  But let me say this about what happened with Budapest.
[01:39:44.281 --> 01:39:56.546]  And I mean, I've got some things I could share with you, but maybe you don't want me to share them on the air, of some supernatural things that actually took place, of how we actually ended up in Budapest, because we went to Bratislava.
[01:39:56.586 --> 01:39:58.246]  We were not scheduled to go to Budapest.
[01:39:58.487 --> 01:39:59.547]  That was our night off.
[01:40:00.146 --> 01:40:09.560]  And through a series of events that really was involving, I know people might not believe it, but involving an angel of the Lord that spoke to the pastor to have me come.
[01:40:10.081 --> 01:40:11.123]  I went to that church.
[01:40:12.016 --> 01:40:14.338]  These guys are shaking Hungary.
[01:40:14.638 --> 01:40:15.679]  They have a university.
[01:40:15.699 --> 01:40:16.559]  They have a seminary.
[01:40:16.619 --> 01:40:17.940]  They have a weekly newspaper.
[01:40:18.261 --> 01:40:22.604]  They have a 24-hour news network, which is the third largest in the country.
[01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:28.047]  And it is... My jaw dropped open because I was there 20 years ago.
[01:40:28.067 --> 01:40:30.489]  They have 70,000 members in the church.
[01:40:31.036 --> 01:40:35.379]  And that church, basically, really, when you look at it, they put over a hundred people in government.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:41.404]  They actually formulated the constitution for Hungary, where that marriage was between a man and a woman.
[01:40:41.944 --> 01:40:45.727]  And I spoke to the pastor and he said, look, he said, he actually doesn't travel.
[01:40:45.907 --> 01:40:46.788]  He doesn't go anywhere.
[01:40:46.828 --> 01:40:49.490]  He said, I'm just here for Hungary, for the church.
[01:40:49.890 --> 01:40:51.432]  And he said, we're going to shake our country.
[01:40:51.792 --> 01:40:59.558]  So, I mean, I was so encouraged when I saw that, but then also traveling to the other places and then also to see the people that love Trump.
[01:40:59.958 --> 01:41:05.800]  From Finland to Bratislava they're wearing mega Make America Great Again hats.
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:06.901]  France!
[01:41:07.181 --> 01:41:10.662]  The pastors in France that said how they appreciate the president.
[01:41:11.022 --> 01:41:14.363]  So whatever you see on mainstream media is just total bull.
[01:41:15.104 --> 01:41:16.524]  And that's what I've read.
[01:41:17.164 --> 01:41:18.245]  So please speak to this pastor.
[01:41:19.225 --> 01:41:45.442]  Is that it's Hungary, it was the church that reignited the nationalism, that exposed it, and that helped now get a good president elected, and blocked the giant Islamic invasion, and now the pastor's saying, if we don't have Christianity, we don't have a culture, Christianity's under attack, and now it's spreading all over Europe, and again, that shows the power of that one church, and you're saying, you literally, by a divine intervention, got led to that church, and this happened.
[01:41:46.912 --> 01:41:48.954]  Yeah, because I wasn't scheduled to go there.
[01:41:48.994 --> 01:41:50.456]  We had been there 20 years ago.
[01:41:50.536 --> 01:41:52.218]  People said, do you want to go back to that church?
[01:41:52.278 --> 01:41:52.758]  I said, no.
[01:41:53.259 --> 01:41:54.700]  I don't call him, he calls me.
[01:41:55.061 --> 01:42:04.711]  So when I was sitting on the front row, Pastor Eric said to me, my right-hand guy, he said, listen, Pastor Shandor just texted his son-in-law and said, would you come to Budapest tomorrow night?
[01:42:05.231 --> 01:42:08.252]  And immediately I heard the Lord say, go and strengthen him.
[01:42:08.692 --> 01:42:13.234]  So I went there and then he told me he was praying and he said he had his eyes closed.
[01:42:13.574 --> 01:42:15.655]  And he said he heard a voice say, look up.
[01:42:15.695 --> 01:42:18.456]  He looked up and there was an angel standing to the side.
[01:42:18.677 --> 01:42:22.478]  And the angel said, have Rodney Brown come to Budapest tomorrow night.
[01:42:22.798 --> 01:42:29.421]  Now, people might not believe this, but that's how I ended up in Budapest on Saturday night on the only night supposed to be my off night.
[01:42:29.901 --> 01:42:31.962]  And let me tell you, it was electrifying.
[01:42:32.062 --> 01:42:35.103]  Alex, if I took you there, I've never seen anything like it in my life.
[01:42:35.703 --> 01:42:37.184]  It was a five-hour service.
[01:42:37.224 --> 01:42:38.424]  That's their regular service.
[01:42:38.884 --> 01:42:40.305]  Everything was professional.
[01:42:40.605 --> 01:42:42.746]  The television, the lights, the music.
[01:42:43.426 --> 01:42:44.787]  It was beyond imagination.
[01:42:44.847 --> 01:42:46.227]  My whole team was blown away.
[01:42:46.247 --> 01:42:46.948]  Let's be clear.
[01:42:47.028 --> 01:42:48.368]  And now I've read about that church.
[01:42:48.488 --> 01:42:49.128]  It came from nowhere.
[01:42:49.148 --> 01:42:49.949]  You were there 20 years ago.
[01:42:49.969 --> 01:42:53.090]  It's now the detonator for the total defense of Europe.
[01:42:54.051 --> 01:42:55.094]  This is incredible!
[01:42:55.535 --> 01:42:59.744]  That's right, the resistance to the New World Order is powered by Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.
[01:42:59.784 --> 01:43:00.646]  The enemy hates it.
[01:43:03.055 --> 01:43:13.306]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[01:43:13.686 --> 01:43:25.738]  And as we prepare to close out 2018, isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[01:43:26.779 --> 01:43:32.023]  Or do you say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man?
[01:43:32.263 --> 01:43:33.443]  Well, that's dead naming.
[01:43:33.724 --> 01:43:41.769]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[01:43:42.129 --> 01:43:45.311]  Then they say it's racist to say, no, that it's okay to be white.
[01:43:45.651 --> 01:43:48.433]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation or borders.
[01:43:48.873 --> 01:43:51.535]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told is evil.
[01:43:51.995 --> 01:43:55.558]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[01:43:56.482 --> 01:43:58.423]  World War III was the Cold War.
[01:43:59.803 --> 01:44:01.504]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[01:44:01.904 --> 01:44:19.511]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others, with the America-hating Hollywood crowd, literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left.
[01:44:21.238 --> 01:44:24.580]  The globalists are threatened by first world nations.
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:25.881]  They're threatened by the middle class.
[01:44:25.921 --> 01:44:30.223]  They're threatened by the uppity-ness of free market capitalism.
[01:44:30.824 --> 01:44:34.846]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[01:44:35.606 --> 01:44:37.207]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[01:44:37.668 --> 01:44:40.409]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:42.811]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[01:44:42.891 --> 01:44:47.113]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[01:44:47.653 --> 01:44:50.395]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[01:44:51.923 --> 01:44:57.949]  The globalists are counter-striking against independent, patriot, nationalist media like InfoWars.
[01:44:57.969 --> 01:45:02.434]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective.
[01:45:02.474 --> 01:45:05.237]  Thanks to your support, you have been the most effective.
[01:45:06.357 --> 01:45:07.898]  At exposing what's really happening.
[01:45:08.499 --> 01:45:12.802]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[01:45:13.243 --> 01:45:16.766]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[01:45:17.366 --> 01:45:21.369]  And I wanted just to remind you that InfoWars isn't perfect but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[01:45:22.594 --> 01:45:23.715]  And without you, we won't be here.
[01:45:24.315 --> 01:45:28.317]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[01:45:29.517 --> 01:45:31.858]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:32.339 --> 01:45:41.103]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[01:45:41.183 --> 01:45:43.844]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[01:45:44.364 --> 01:45:44.804]  I think so.
[01:46:10.737 --> 01:46:27.403]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding InfoWars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[01:46:27.904 --> 01:46:39.148]  And you are provisioning and funding not just the second American revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[01:46:39.948 --> 01:46:41.109]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:19.851 --> 01:47:28.257]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:30.481 --> 01:47:31.763]  All right, it's 6 after next hour.
[01:47:31.783 --> 01:47:33.645]  We're going to get a world explosive with Roger Stone.
[01:47:34.406 --> 01:47:43.677]  Is the American spectator taking him out of context that he believes Trump is not going to run for president, that he's going to pull out the next year and a half?
[01:47:43.697 --> 01:47:47.602]  And that's why he's been really defending Pence, saying he likes Pence, he loves Pence.
[01:47:48.343 --> 01:47:55.050]  I don't know if that's the case, but Roger hasn't been wrong very many times, but Trump's rhetoric is the opposite, and I think Trump's committed to the fight.
[01:47:55.831 --> 01:47:56.732]  I think Roger's wrong.
[01:47:57.612 --> 01:47:59.434]  Is this an accurate statement from Roger Stone?
[01:47:59.474 --> 01:48:03.258]  He'll be joining us coming up at 6 after.
[01:48:03.298 --> 01:48:07.723]  Then at the bottom of the hour, our reporters are back and forth between Tijuana and San Diego.
[01:48:08.902 --> 01:48:17.873]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, one of the most globetrotting evangelicals, the real deal out there, does a great job as ministry here in the United States, formerly from South Africa.
[01:48:18.473 --> 01:48:25.401]  He was getting into the big awakening that he's seen in Europe, and the miraculous things that are happening, and the fact that he ended up going back to the church.
[01:48:26.082 --> 01:48:31.824]  Uh, in Hungary, that they admit helped detonate, uh, the whole nationalist awakening that's happening.
[01:48:32.424 --> 01:48:40.527]  I talked to a lot of people, uh, who work and live in Europe, a lot of people that are Ukrainian, Polish, you name it, and they tell me that there really is a huge awakening.
[01:48:41.207 --> 01:48:44.128]  Have you been to Russia, A, and B, regardless?
[01:48:44.488 --> 01:48:47.890]  What are you told about the Christian awakening that we read about there?
[01:48:48.330 --> 01:48:49.130]  Is that accurate?
[01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:52.472]  Because some of the leftist people say, oh, that's all baloney.
[01:48:52.792 --> 01:49:03.936]  Putin's just saying he supports Christianity on the surface, but he's not really a Christian, even though it's admitted that he was baptized secretly when he was a little kid and stuff, and that the church was just underground in the Soviet Union.
[01:49:03.956 --> 01:49:05.357]  What's your intel on that, Pastor Brown?
[01:49:07.186 --> 01:49:10.369]  There are millions of believers across Russia and the Ukraine.
[01:49:10.569 --> 01:49:14.352]  I mean, I was in the Ukraine two Decembers ago.
[01:49:14.813 --> 01:49:16.394]  Phenomenal, large church.
[01:49:16.594 --> 01:49:19.136]  We had 6,000 people in attendance for that night.
[01:49:19.717 --> 01:49:23.120]  And he probably runs 15,000 members there.
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:26.203]  So, and the same is with Russia.
[01:49:26.303 --> 01:49:33.469]  All across Russia, even in places like Siberia, which they're begging me to come there, and I'm probably going to be going to Russia in the new year.
[01:49:33.909 --> 01:49:38.494]  But, so, for anybody to say that that's not happening, they don't know what they're talking about.
[01:49:38.895 --> 01:49:42.819]  Russia, you know, when the walls came down, that's what happened with the church in Budapest.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:44.782]  That church was built underground.
[01:49:45.142 --> 01:49:48.265]  That pastor had suffered at the hands of the Communists.
[01:49:48.946 --> 01:49:55.069]  And here's the thing, too, about Hungary, was Hungary, if you go back in its history, was invaded by Islam.
[01:49:55.269 --> 01:49:56.669]  They killed all the Hungarians.
[01:49:56.709 --> 01:50:04.492]  So that's why Hungary has such an adverse reaction towards radical Islam, because they understand what the agenda is.
[01:50:04.533 --> 01:50:05.093]  They have a genetic memory.
[01:50:05.113 --> 01:50:06.593]  So they haven't forgotten their history.
[01:50:07.014 --> 01:50:07.814]  They have a genetic memory.
[01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:08.814]  So they haven't forgotten.
[01:50:09.515 --> 01:50:09.735]  Correct.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:21.827]  You know, and here's the thing, Russia is a victim of the New World Order, as well as all these countries are being played, like on a chessboard, and the globalists play with all of them.
[01:50:22.067 --> 01:50:23.808]  But the people are precious, Alex.
[01:50:24.269 --> 01:50:32.314]  I mean, I meet the Russians that drove in to the meetings in Bratislava, and some that came down to Kisenov, Moldova.
[01:50:32.594 --> 01:50:34.515]  They're hungry, they're precious people.
[01:50:34.796 --> 01:50:38.078]  And you must understand, I come from South Africa, so we didn't like Russians.
[01:50:38.919 --> 01:50:46.289]  You know, we felt the only good Russian was a dead Russian back when I was a kid growing up because of communism and the whole thing.
[01:50:46.309 --> 01:50:47.170]  Well, let's explain.
[01:50:47.190 --> 01:50:50.255]  The Russians and the Cubans were funding invasions just north of you.
[01:50:51.846 --> 01:50:52.226]  Correct.
[01:50:52.306 --> 01:50:59.232]  And of course, they wanted to control the sea route and they wanted, you know, they wanted the diamonds and they wanted everything that South Africa had.
[01:50:59.672 --> 01:51:04.956]  So, I mean, we had Russian AK-47s all over our country, Russian limpet mines being blown up.
[01:51:05.076 --> 01:51:09.259]  I mean, the ANC had a start coming out of Communist Soviet Russia.
[01:51:09.339 --> 01:51:12.842]  So, you know, that's why we were totally adverse against anything they do.
[01:51:13.062 --> 01:51:20.367]  They were coming and taking all of our young African men, taking them to Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, training them to be freedom fighters.
[01:51:21.048 --> 01:51:21.168]  So,
[01:51:22.290 --> 01:51:26.554]  You know, this is what's so, uh... Well, let's just say it.
[01:51:26.594 --> 01:51:31.698]  The Afrikaners held off the 10-to-1, the big commie invasion.
[01:51:31.978 --> 01:51:37.123]  And so you can say, as an aficionado, about what's happening, that Russia is different now.
[01:51:38.806 --> 01:51:39.807]  Totally, totally.
[01:51:40.387 --> 01:51:42.388]  And now the Russians have experienced freedom.
[01:51:42.468 --> 01:51:44.929]  They don't want to go back under communism.
[01:51:44.989 --> 01:51:46.050]  They want freedom.
[01:51:46.190 --> 01:51:50.272]  And the freedom that came to Russia really was the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:51:50.592 --> 01:51:53.093]  There's huge churches all over, from St.
[01:51:53.153 --> 01:51:54.734]  Petersburg to Moscow.
[01:51:55.274 --> 01:52:01.963]  Right up into Siberia, many of the Russian cities, and then all the previous Russian states.
[01:52:02.524 --> 01:52:11.856]  And the reason I know this is true is not just you and not just the evidence there, but Hollywood's given interviews in major leftist papers and said why they hate Russia now.
[01:52:12.296 --> 01:52:18.240]  When they loved it and Bernie Sanders would vacation there, you know, on his honeymoon, piss on Christians basically, literally.
[01:52:19.621 --> 01:52:28.728]  Now that Russia is so Christian and so profoundly and bans brainwashing kids about transgenderism and all this stuff that you should do, that's child abuse.
[01:52:28.788 --> 01:52:32.371]  That's why the left hates Russia so bad because Russia's the one that got away.
[01:52:34.835 --> 01:52:35.235]  Correct.
[01:52:35.675 --> 01:52:45.198]  But I mean, you go back, we talk about it in The Killing of Uncle Sam, the book that you talked about earlier, and you see how the Bolshevik Revolution was actually funded out of the United States.
[01:52:45.618 --> 01:52:48.279]  Communism was actually funded out of America.
[01:52:48.339 --> 01:52:52.260]  Stalin was all of that, you know, the whole thing.
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:58.122]  People actually don't know the history of what is actually taking place, because the globalists played both sides of the fence.
[01:52:58.802 --> 01:53:16.178]  Let's be clear, the American left went in with British and set up the Bolsheviks to wipe out the Christians, and as they saw the czars as weak as they had their own problems, and then now the very same leftists through Soros and others, the very same crowd, the very same people, are trying to do that here.
[01:53:16.458 --> 01:53:18.480]  They're making their leftist Bolshevik move.
[01:53:20.006 --> 01:53:31.035]  Which I was standing in Budapest in that big crowd a few weeks ago, laughing my head off, because here's Soros trying to mess with Florida, trying to steal the election.
[01:53:31.375 --> 01:53:33.116]  Everybody was sending me messages praying.
[01:53:33.156 --> 01:53:34.237]  I said, I'm not praying.
[01:53:34.597 --> 01:53:37.280]  We have prayed, and they will not prevail.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:38.901]  And of course, you know the outcome.
[01:53:39.081 --> 01:53:39.882]  They didn't prevail.
[01:53:40.102 --> 01:53:43.084]  But we were that close to having a communist governor.
[01:53:43.364 --> 01:53:45.266]  We were like right on the edge.
[01:53:45.666 --> 01:53:48.548]  But I really felt that the Lord wouldn't give us victory.
[01:53:48.848 --> 01:53:49.808]  It's the same with Trump.
[01:53:49.828 --> 01:53:52.029]  You know, everybody says, oh, this, that, and the other thing.
[01:53:52.089 --> 01:53:53.130]  I said, listen, we prayed.
[01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:56.512]  God gave America a last-minute reprieve with Trump.
[01:53:56.952 --> 01:54:00.834]  And he might not be an angel, but let me tell you, he's a wrecking ball.
[01:54:01.014 --> 01:54:02.755]  Even Soros just said it last week.
[01:54:02.775 --> 01:54:05.896]  He said Trump has almost destroyed the New World Order.
[01:54:06.177 --> 01:54:08.158]  So you can see, we actually are winning.
[01:54:08.698 --> 01:54:09.939]  They are not winning.
[01:54:09.999 --> 01:54:10.699]  They are losing.
[01:54:11.019 --> 01:54:15.422]  Oh yeah, he told the New York Times that, and people say, oh, Trump's really New World Order Alex.
[01:54:15.842 --> 01:54:16.803]  Oh, he's one of them.
[01:54:16.843 --> 01:54:17.023]  No.
[01:54:17.543 --> 01:54:19.004]  All hell has broke loose.
[01:54:19.044 --> 01:54:20.965]  They are trying to destroy anyone that supports him.
[01:54:21.365 --> 01:54:29.871]  You read the whole Bible or history, God always ends up raising up imperfect people like Trump, because he is stubborn like a mule, and tough like a lion.
[01:54:30.231 --> 01:54:38.176]  And I know for a fact, you know him, you've prayed with him, that Trump was always pro-Christian, but now he really has felt the Spirit.
[01:54:38.556 --> 01:54:39.757]  He says, I've changed.
[01:54:40.137 --> 01:54:41.398]  I know this is a spiritual battle.
[01:54:41.438 --> 01:54:47.885]  I've had private conversations with him about the energy in churches and how much he loves God and how we need to have religious freedom in America.
[01:54:48.145 --> 01:54:52.769]  And I'm like, he's brought this up to me many times and he's not telling me what I want to hear.
[01:54:53.130 --> 01:54:54.271]  Trump gets it.
[01:54:54.531 --> 01:54:55.212]  He really gets it.
[01:54:56.826 --> 01:55:03.212]  Yeah, and I believe God is using him as a wrecking ball against the globalist agenda to give America one last chance.
[01:55:03.592 --> 01:55:05.133]  Here's the problem, Alex.
[01:55:05.213 --> 01:55:07.675]  Many in the church are sleeping.
[01:55:07.976 --> 01:55:11.799]  People think this is a Republican and Democrat situation.
[01:55:12.119 --> 01:55:15.122]  Fact is, we had the House, we had the Senate, we had everything.
[01:55:15.382 --> 01:55:15.963]  What did they do?
[01:55:16.243 --> 01:55:16.583]  Nothing.
[01:55:16.883 --> 01:55:20.026]  Because the Republican Party, many of them, has sold their souls.
[01:55:20.427 --> 01:55:23.329]  So, you know, obviously in the midterms the thing flipped.
[01:55:23.610 --> 01:55:28.074]  But that's so that the Republicans can craft a comeback in 2020 and look like winners.
[01:55:28.614 --> 01:55:29.975]  The whole thing's a big scam.
[01:55:30.316 --> 01:55:31.457]  But, nonetheless,
[01:55:33.138 --> 01:55:49.456]  President Trump is making huge strides and if anybody knows actually of what he's actually done and seen the ground that's been gained for the church, for the body of Christ, no other president in the history of America since its founding has done what this president's done.
[01:55:49.516 --> 01:55:51.478]  No president has gone to the pro-life rallies.
[01:55:51.618 --> 01:55:51.999]  He did it.
[01:55:52.299 --> 01:55:54.381]  No president has said leave Christians alone.
[01:55:54.521 --> 01:55:54.921]  He's done it.
[01:55:55.221 --> 01:55:58.283]  No president has moved legislation to stop persecuting Christians.
[01:55:59.864 --> 01:56:05.608]  Trump has been trying to deliver, but like you said, the Republican establishment obstructed him.
[01:56:06.509 --> 01:56:10.752]  40 plus Republicans basically resigned and left because they're bought and paid for.
[01:56:10.812 --> 01:56:13.134]  They have thrown everything they can at Trump.
[01:56:13.714 --> 01:56:15.755]  Gut level, I think he's going to run for president again.
[01:56:15.775 --> 01:56:16.576]  I think he's going to win.
[01:56:16.616 --> 01:56:17.737]  I think Roger Stone's wrong.
[01:56:19.235 --> 01:56:20.876]  No, I believe he will win again.
[01:56:21.077 --> 01:56:21.717]  And you know what?
[01:56:21.757 --> 01:56:29.683]  I'm laughing at, of course, if you look at mainstream media on Twitter, every third tweet is about some loser who says they're going to run for president.
[01:56:30.064 --> 01:56:32.726]  Trump will give him a nickname and take him out.
[01:56:33.046 --> 01:56:35.568]  I mean, I like get the bag of popcorn.
[01:56:36.008 --> 01:56:37.370]  I mean, really, you're going to watch.
[01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:38.911]  Look what happened in Brazil.
[01:56:39.231 --> 01:56:42.354]  Brazil just had a Trump style president win.
[01:56:42.694 --> 01:56:43.935]  And I met the Brazilians.
[01:56:43.975 --> 01:56:47.758]  They were in Europe and they said, oh, we had a great victory in our country.
[01:56:48.038 --> 01:56:50.761]  So you could see the same thing happening even in Italy.
[01:56:51.041 --> 01:56:52.442]  You could see the same thing happening.
[01:56:52.822 --> 01:56:53.703]  It's on the rise.
[01:56:54.144 --> 01:57:10.739]  And I know Theresa May is playing around with the whole Brexit thing, but on the ground, on the grassroots level, the British people know we have to get free of this whole thing, because the next thing is to take, if they can take Turkey, bring it into the EU, that will flood England with
[01:57:11.628 --> 01:57:12.890]  Millions and millions of Turks.
[01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:14.291]  That's the end of the UK.
[01:57:14.372 --> 01:57:14.692]  Finished.
[01:57:14.772 --> 01:57:15.092]  Gone.
[01:57:15.353 --> 01:57:15.933]  It's hanging on by a thread.
[01:57:15.953 --> 01:57:19.838]  And that's the admitted plan, and they all vote how the Turkish dictator tells them.
[01:57:20.379 --> 01:57:23.803]  Just do five more minutes and talk about how you think the enemy will counter-strike, what people can do.
[01:57:24.283 --> 01:57:26.506]  With Pastor Rodney Howard Brown straight ahead, because...
[01:57:27.707 --> 01:57:36.612]  This is such an incredible time to be alive and you can get his book Killing Uncle Sam at Infowarsstore.com or get it at KillingUncleSamBook.com.
[01:57:37.032 --> 01:57:45.956]  You may know all about the New World Order, but this is the best condensed history up to the present to read and then donate to the library or your church.
[01:57:45.996 --> 01:57:48.998]  You've got to get The Killing of Uncle Sam at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:55.165 --> 01:58:02.488]  Probably 10 years ago or more that Barbra Streisand had this huge mansion on the edge of the ocean.
[01:58:03.428 --> 01:58:04.908]  And somebody had just reported about it.
[01:58:05.809 --> 01:58:08.070]  And so she tried to have them basically shut down.
[01:58:08.090 --> 01:58:11.471]  And that drew a million times more attention to it all.
[01:58:12.171 --> 01:58:21.599]  But the social engineers, because I read about it in the news, they actually openly talk about how to censor conservatives and nationalists, and how to make sure people don't care about it.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:26.364]  And they say, well, as long as we censor a lot of them at one time, it won't matter.
[01:58:26.644 --> 01:58:29.847]  And they'll give it more attention at first, but then later everybody will forget about it.
[01:58:29.887 --> 01:58:31.408]  Because the public's dumb and doesn't have a memory.
[01:58:31.768 --> 01:58:34.651]  They're betting on you not valuing information.
[01:58:34.891 --> 01:58:36.973]  And there are thousands of channels out there, tens of thousands.
[01:58:37.958 --> 01:58:43.842]  InfoWars is what they've targeted particularly because we've got their number and we know about their criminal plans.
[01:58:44.342 --> 01:58:49.706]  So of all the ways you can spread the word about InfoWars, the newest and one of the coolest is hiding in plain view.
[01:58:50.186 --> 01:58:50.886]  Why did I think of this?
[01:58:51.387 --> 01:58:52.307]  Text the word NEWS.
[01:58:53.528 --> 01:58:54.628]  To the number 3-3-2-2-2.
[01:58:56.149 --> 01:59:05.792]  And we will send you one alert a day of the most important breaking news for you to hopefully spread, everybody you know, to cause that chain reaction of communication they fear so much.
[01:59:05.812 --> 01:59:12.714]  And if you want to get live breaking news feeds, when it's not just my main show every day, but emergency live reports we do almost every day.
[01:59:13.054 --> 01:59:17.115]  When we do those, we will send you a text that we're going live.
[01:59:17.275 --> 01:59:18.275]  Hopefully you'll spread it.
[01:59:18.295 --> 01:59:19.315]  That's what's really key.
[01:59:19.796 --> 01:59:20.496]  Text the word SHOW
[01:59:21.536 --> 01:59:22.357]  To the number 3-3-2-2-2.
[01:59:22.537 --> 01:59:26.879]  Ladies and gentlemen, nothing can stop you when you take action.
[01:59:27.479 --> 01:59:29.421]  Nothing can stop you when you resist the globalists.
[01:59:29.941 --> 01:59:33.723]  They are counting on you being weak and having no memory and not taking action.
[01:59:34.183 --> 01:59:40.287]  When you make it fun to fight these bastards and realize it's an info war, you're unstoppable and we will defeat these people.
[01:59:40.687 --> 01:59:42.608]  Everything is now in your hands.
[01:59:43.168 --> 01:59:45.510]  Text to those numbers and spread those links.
[01:59:56.886 --> 02:00:00.230]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:06.397]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:00:13.709 --> 02:00:17.194]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:17.814 --> 02:00:19.296]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.316 --> 02:00:24.062]  There's a very important report that just went live at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:00:24.102 --> 02:00:28.588]  You want to share it from newswars.com because they block infowars.com on almost every
[02:00:29.804 --> 02:00:34.185]  College system, universities, libraries, Boeing.
[02:00:35.285 --> 02:00:36.886]  The Pentagon still has leftists in it.
[02:00:36.906 --> 02:00:39.586]  They're blocking Infowars.com there, but not Newswars.com.
[02:00:39.626 --> 02:00:41.567]  Of course, they'll probably start blocking that.
[02:00:41.587 --> 02:00:44.807]  We'll have more sites we continue to tell you about to get around the globalists.
[02:00:45.648 --> 02:00:46.488]  But Trump was right.
[02:00:46.908 --> 02:00:49.889]  Children smuggled traffic from migrant caravan.
[02:00:50.369 --> 02:00:51.649]  And it's all the proof right there.
[02:00:52.349 --> 02:00:53.929]  But of course, the mainstream media says he's wrong.
[02:00:54.730 --> 02:00:56.110]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:01.912]  I know there's an awakening happening and we've been positive and I want to be positive, but at the same time...
[02:01:03.181 --> 02:01:10.865]  The globalists are moving with the mark of the beast, with world government, with sexualizing our children, and it's suddenly activating everywhere.
[02:01:10.925 --> 02:01:13.106]  I don't even have to look for it and it's in my face.
[02:01:14.046 --> 02:01:17.028]  And it makes me feel guilty that I'm not doing enough.
[02:01:17.088 --> 02:01:23.591]  So just, and I respect you as a pastor, I've been watching you for over a decade online, and so you're kind of my pastor.
[02:01:24.672 --> 02:01:25.892]  How do I deal with this?
[02:01:25.952 --> 02:01:30.955]  Because it's not even a guilt thing, it's more, and it's beyond an anger thing, it is a
[02:01:32.739 --> 02:01:33.039]  It is.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.161]  It's beyond frustration.
[02:01:35.461 --> 02:01:36.302]  It's like being on fire.
[02:01:36.822 --> 02:01:43.787]  And it's kind of a good thing when I'm taking action, but the rest of the time it's just like... I don't know how to explain it.
[02:01:43.907 --> 02:01:47.010]  And I guess it's supposed to be there all the time.
[02:01:47.050 --> 02:01:51.473]  I know Ezekiel talks about the fire in the bones and it won't go away, but it's getting worse.
[02:01:51.773 --> 02:01:54.935]  Because it's like the closer the enemy gets to taking over, I just can't stand it.
[02:01:56.517 --> 02:01:56.697]  Yeah.
[02:01:56.997 --> 02:01:57.978]  Look, here's the thing.
[02:01:58.058 --> 02:02:02.061]  I mean, everybody I think that's doing something always feels like they're not doing enough.
[02:02:02.657 --> 02:02:08.042]  Because I have a lot of ministers come around, they see what I'm doing, they say, look, in comparison to what they're doing, they're not doing enough.
[02:02:08.362 --> 02:02:09.443]  Here's what I tell people.
[02:02:10.004 --> 02:02:15.990]  Everybody must do what you are able to do, and within the abilities that God has given to you.
[02:02:16.290 --> 02:02:18.552]  God gave you a voice, it goes around the world.
[02:02:18.912 --> 02:02:23.497]  Obviously their voices, they try to silence your voice, but you're still there, you're still doing.
[02:02:23.777 --> 02:02:26.640]  So with every fiber of your being, you continue to do it.
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:27.881]  The same with me.
[02:02:28.221 --> 02:02:30.203]  They made up all kinds of lies about me.
[02:02:30.603 --> 02:02:32.705]  I ignore it because it's actually funny now.
[02:02:33.125 --> 02:02:36.708]  So you just stay focused and just keep doing what you're doing every day.
[02:02:38.209 --> 02:02:44.394]  You know, we felt to run to 300 cities, one night meetings, and just mobilize leaders.
[02:02:44.474 --> 02:02:49.959]  If I can mobilize 100 leaders per city, 300 cities, that's 30,000 leaders in the next two years.
[02:02:50.259 --> 02:02:51.600]  So what I try to tell people
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:52.580]  We're good.
[02:03:08.789 --> 02:03:14.374]  Anybody, whoever you are, in government, ministers, make every shot count.
[02:03:14.735 --> 02:03:20.180]  And don't look at the other people that maybe are doing more than you're doing or have a bigger voice than you.
[02:03:20.621 --> 02:03:24.565]  Just let your voice be heard and ask the Holy Spirit to help you.
[02:03:24.965 --> 02:03:30.551]  So even tonight, before you go to sleep, just on your bed, just say, Holy Spirit, come.
[02:03:31.091 --> 02:03:33.413]  Jesus said you were to be my comforter.
[02:03:33.473 --> 02:03:34.273]  Come and teach me.
[02:03:34.594 --> 02:03:37.536]  Show me what to do that I can be more effective for you.
[02:03:37.836 --> 02:03:51.885]  And then also one of the things I've learned, Alex, that I've got to be careful that I don't get taken down a rabbit hole or run down an area that I'm not supposed to be because there's a lot of things I can get involved in and then there's things that I shouldn't get involved in.
[02:03:52.145 --> 02:03:52.846]  So I have to stay
[02:03:53.426 --> 02:03:55.108]  I've got to stay with the main mission.
[02:03:55.208 --> 02:03:56.309]  What's the main mission?
[02:03:56.369 --> 02:04:01.233]  And stay on the main mission, which is igniting the fires for revival and winning souls.
[02:04:01.633 --> 02:04:04.776]  And so if I stay with that, everything else is an additive.
[02:04:04.796 --> 02:04:09.540]  I remember when we did Killing Uncle Sam, everybody thought I'm going off the rails, but I'm not.
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:11.762]  I just added that to what we do.
[02:04:11.782 --> 02:04:12.582]  So people have context.
[02:04:12.602 --> 02:04:16.125]  But what you said is absolutely essential, and it's the key to it.
[02:04:16.926 --> 02:04:25.151]  Is that it's Christians all over the world that are opposing the world government, the New World Order, because the globalist brainwashing with somebody who really has the spirit of God in them doesn't work.
[02:04:25.211 --> 02:04:28.373]  Doesn't mean we're perfect, doesn't mean we go off the rails, doesn't mean we don't... No.
[02:04:28.613 --> 02:04:33.536]  But it means that we still can really see through it and it's that discernment we've all got to pray for.
[02:04:34.116 --> 02:04:42.879]  And you're absolutely right, and when I've shot the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit just says you need to pray more on there, you need to keep pointing out, get right with God, and then everything else will flow from that.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:52.943]  Pastor, Revival.com, KillingLittleSamBook.com, thank you, and thank you for the great news and your great work, and all your great supporters with what you just did on this latest operation.
[02:04:53.223 --> 02:04:55.844]  Please keep popping in whenever you have time to give us updates.
[02:04:55.864 --> 02:04:56.325]  God bless.
[02:04:58.025 --> 02:04:59.906]  All right, we'll be back with Roger Stone.
[02:04:59.946 --> 02:05:00.766]  This is big news.
[02:05:01.386 --> 02:05:02.507]  And then our reporters are at the border.
[02:05:03.901 --> 02:05:09.907]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:05:10.287 --> 02:05:12.889]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:16.953]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:05:17.194 --> 02:05:21.478]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:05:21.898 --> 02:05:25.161]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:05:26.062 --> 02:05:36.289]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:05:37.049 --> 02:05:45.595]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:05:47.216 --> 02:05:55.758]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[02:05:56.258 --> 02:06:02.699]  Try Bodies today at InfoWarsLife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:03.119 --> 02:06:11.801]  In this briefing room right now, there is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:26.701]  But I'll say, uh, that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:06:26.741 --> 02:06:28.361]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:06:28.461 --> 02:06:32.182]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:06:32.882 --> 02:06:33.862]  They came in peace.
[02:06:53.047 --> 02:06:58.909]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[02:06:58.969 --> 02:07:04.951]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:17.696]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[02:07:17.876 --> 02:07:19.056]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[02:07:19.216 --> 02:07:20.357]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[02:07:28.178 --> 02:07:29.540]  This is CNN.
[02:07:37.868 --> 02:07:43.033]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:07:47.216 --> 02:07:51.437]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[02:07:52.197 --> 02:07:59.939]  The number one nationalist, pro-human, pro-Christian, pro-capitalist broadcast in the world.
[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:04.841]  And the most hated, demonized, and lied about broadcast in the world.
[02:08:06.041 --> 02:08:08.642]  Cowards and bootlickers run from Infowars.
[02:08:09.262 --> 02:08:09.842]  Patriots!
[02:08:10.717 --> 02:08:14.461]  Who love freedom and hate pedophiles run towards us.
[02:08:15.582 --> 02:08:20.288]  We're taking on the monsters and we're getting victory after victory thanks to all of your support.
[02:08:20.328 --> 02:08:23.752]  Now, as everybody knows, I don't cover the whole...
[02:08:25.137 --> 02:08:27.338]  Russiagate thing in the main every day.
[02:08:27.678 --> 02:08:33.420]  The latest BS that comes out of Robert Mueller and all these America-hating Democrats.
[02:08:34.721 --> 02:08:37.142]  These 30-something Democrats he's hired that run this operation.
[02:08:37.462 --> 02:08:40.083]  Hillary's former top lawyer that helped cover up the foundation.
[02:08:40.143 --> 02:08:40.503]  All of it.
[02:08:41.464 --> 02:08:45.465]  The people that should be indicted for Russiagate are Robert Mueller and others.
[02:08:45.506 --> 02:08:46.246]  I mean, literally.
[02:08:46.826 --> 02:08:48.487]  Tarmac, uranium, you name it.
[02:08:49.397 --> 02:08:58.480]  You know, Corsi, God love him, he's a great investigative journalist, but a lot of the big breaking stuff he would put out was the New York Times 2015 Hillary Clinton's Russia problem.
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:02.381]  I mean, if that used to be in the news, then he would just go get the latest.
[02:09:02.602 --> 02:09:04.042]  And they ask, how'd you know about this?
[02:09:04.922 --> 02:09:06.003]  Because everybody knew.
[02:09:07.023 --> 02:09:10.924]  So, Corsi's certainly good at building stuff up.
[02:09:11.565 --> 02:09:13.725]  He's not just a good writer, you know, he's a good showman.
[02:09:14.786 --> 02:09:18.087]  But instead of getting into the minutia of this, there's big developments.
[02:09:19.450 --> 02:09:31.096]  They're saying, top story on DrudgeReport.com, and it's on Infowars.com, let's put it on screen for TV viewers, that supposedly Paul Manafort visited the Equatorian Embassy.
[02:09:31.977 --> 02:09:34.558]  Now WikiLeaks is offering millions of dollars if this is true.
[02:09:34.598 --> 02:09:35.899]  They say it's total bull.
[02:09:36.499 --> 02:09:38.140]  And we've seen stuff out of the news before.
[02:09:38.661 --> 02:09:42.983]  Oh, General Flynn admits they're all Russian agents, yay!
[02:09:43.543 --> 02:09:46.665]  And then of course it was a hoax, and the ABC journalist had to resign.
[02:09:47.875 --> 02:09:50.356]  So this is all being totally denied.
[02:09:51.257 --> 02:09:53.277]  CNN says met with Ecuadorian president.
[02:09:53.338 --> 02:09:58.000]  Well, they also say that he took the bust of Martin Luther King out and wasn't going to win the presidency.
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:02.542]  Thousands and thousands of other bizarre lies that we all know about.
[02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:06.063]  So, we've got that.
[02:10:07.024 --> 02:10:10.325]  You've got Dershowitz saying Mueller not going to produce balance fair report.
[02:10:11.526 --> 02:10:13.267]  That's like saying that Robert Mueller
[02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.770]  Breathe there.
[02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:15.690]  I mean, this is just a fact.
[02:10:16.351 --> 02:10:32.948]  And then the other big news, which is a quote of Roger Stone, and I've heard Roger say this, and I sure hope he's not wrong, in an article for The Spectator that's linked on DrudgeReport.com, I'm innocent and I wouldn't take a deal, would not take a deal, if Mueller offered me one.
[02:10:34.502 --> 02:10:40.866]  And then he gets into statements here about how he thinks Trump is not going to run again.
[02:10:41.547 --> 02:10:41.907]  And why?
[02:10:41.967 --> 02:10:43.148]  So we're going to look at that.
[02:10:43.208 --> 02:10:46.230]  So first we're going to look at the WikiLeaks Manafort thing.
[02:10:46.530 --> 02:10:49.652]  Then we're going to look at this last piece.
[02:10:50.133 --> 02:10:54.095]  And then we're going to look at Corsi quoted supposedly in some new book coming out.
[02:10:54.716 --> 02:10:55.797]  Who knows if this is true?
[02:10:56.713 --> 02:10:59.855]  That he had a secret deal with Trump for immunity?
[02:11:00.955 --> 02:11:04.177]  And that he had a cover story for Roger Stone about WikiLeaks?
[02:11:04.757 --> 02:11:05.598]  And all this stuff?
[02:11:07.519 --> 02:11:09.440]  And this is getting really weird.
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:11.041]  So first he says they're telling him to lie.
[02:11:12.279 --> 02:11:22.021]  And then he says he's going to plea, and then he says he isn't going to plea, and he isn't going to lie, and now a book that would basically amount to saying that Stone is perjuring himself.
[02:11:22.481 --> 02:11:28.202]  I mean, this has got more turns in it than an action-adventure novel.
[02:11:28.822 --> 02:11:30.003]  And then there's the other big thing.
[02:11:30.103 --> 02:11:32.383]  Paul Manafort does his plea deal.
[02:11:32.423 --> 02:11:35.284]  They take it away and say he lied about something, so they're breaking their deal.
[02:11:35.704 --> 02:11:37.784]  This is just unbelievable.
[02:11:38.104 --> 02:11:40.625]  Roger Stone, my head is spinning at this point, so please.
[02:11:41.656 --> 02:11:44.121]  Take each point as you'd like.
[02:11:44.161 --> 02:11:45.944]  I mean, I just laid out four insane points.
[02:11:46.325 --> 02:11:47.968]  What in hell is going on here?
[02:11:47.988 --> 02:11:51.194]  Yeah, it's very hard to get to the bottom of it.
[02:11:51.274 --> 02:11:54.340]  First of all, let's start with the question of the president's running for re-election.
[02:11:55.163 --> 02:12:04.226]  If you see it in context, what I said was, Donald Trump, unlike previous presidents, doesn't need to be president for his self-worth or his self-esteem.
[02:12:04.666 --> 02:12:07.947]  This job has cost him $2 billion personally.
[02:12:08.047 --> 02:12:13.469]  Unlike the Obamas and the Clintons who made money out of the presidency, this is costing our president.
[02:12:14.345 --> 02:12:36.145]  All I said was, if the economy continues to come roaring back as it has, if he renegotiates the multinational international trade deals to get us better individual trade deals with our trading partners, if he seals our borders, I could see him saying, I have kept all of my promises to the American people,
[02:12:36.765 --> 02:12:37.645]  And walking away.
[02:12:37.966 --> 02:12:41.047]  And he will have gone down as one of our greatest presidents.
[02:12:41.387 --> 02:12:44.488]  Just economic recovery already is historic.
[02:12:44.928 --> 02:12:49.129]  So I was not saying that he could not run for re-election.
[02:12:49.570 --> 02:12:50.930]  I think he certainly could.
[02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:54.031]  But at what cost to himself and his family, Alex?
[02:12:54.411 --> 02:13:01.093]  Every single day he's got to put up with the same kind of personal, vicious, personal attacks that you and I have to put up with.
[02:13:01.434 --> 02:13:02.374]  Only his are worse.
[02:13:02.874 --> 02:13:04.617]  So that was my point.
[02:13:04.657 --> 02:13:07.182]  This is not based on any internal knowledge.
[02:13:07.242 --> 02:13:08.864]  It's just knowing the man.
[02:13:09.245 --> 02:13:10.327]  Perhaps he won't run.
[02:13:10.447 --> 02:13:14.895]  If he's achieved his goals, he's not hanging on for the status of being president.
[02:13:15.155 --> 02:13:16.117]  It's not why he ran.
[02:13:17.247 --> 02:13:30.096]  Well if they got out of the way and let him restore the republic, he obviously would have ended up leaving, I agree with you, but now he's got to stay in power just to defend himself and his family and he's a fighter, so I think that he'll end up running again, but I understand your point.
[02:13:30.436 --> 02:13:39.623]  I think you're probably right and I have said otherwise on the record that if he's under impeachment or if there's any challenge to him, that guarantees that he will run.
[02:13:40.163 --> 02:13:40.804]  Guarantees it.
[02:13:41.286 --> 02:13:46.188]  Alright, well we've also got this linked up on newswars.com and we're going to have the clarification of this video put out.
[02:13:46.568 --> 02:13:50.530]  Roger Stone clarifies statement on President Trump not running in 2020.
[02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:53.111]  Now let's move to what's really big here.
[02:13:53.931 --> 02:14:03.595]  Daily Caller, where you write a lot of articles, has a story here that is out of control bizarre, where supposedly
[02:14:04.725 --> 02:14:13.873]  Of course he's saying he did a secret cover story for you, we don't even know this is true, that he even said this, and that it's in some book, and that you did get wedgie leaks.
[02:14:13.974 --> 02:14:15.695]  What in the world is going on here?
[02:14:16.496 --> 02:14:18.077]  Yeah, it doesn't, it's not even logical.
[02:14:18.137 --> 02:14:19.398]  Here's what Jerry is saying.
[02:14:19.499 --> 02:14:23.122]  He's saying that after my now iconic Podesta tweet,
[02:14:23.849 --> 02:14:29.155]  Immediately after I contacted him and said, I'm getting great heat for this.
[02:14:29.736 --> 02:14:31.618]  I need some cover story.
[02:14:32.058 --> 02:14:33.940]  Well, I wasn't getting any heat.
[02:14:35.061 --> 02:14:41.648]  Until Podesta's emails were published six weeks later, my tweet was not the slightest bit controversial.
[02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:43.330]  It kind of went unnoticed.
[02:14:43.450 --> 02:14:44.512]  So let me say it again.
[02:14:45.132 --> 02:14:53.376]  My tweet was based on Jerry Corsi's original research into the Russian business connections of John and Tony Podesta.
[02:14:54.256 --> 02:14:59.298]  15 days before I said, pardon me, 5 days before I said it would be Podesta's time in the barrel.
[02:14:59.318 --> 02:15:02.080]  Roger, we know, we know what you've said 5,000 times on air.
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.660]  I'm saying, what is this?
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:04.621]  Is this even true?
[02:15:04.861 --> 02:15:05.921]  What's going on with Corsi?
[02:15:05.941 --> 02:15:07.422]  What do you know about this ridiculous article?
[02:15:08.140 --> 02:15:08.842]  Here's what we know.
[02:15:08.862 --> 02:15:13.475]  A federal prosecutor, when they put the squeeze on you, can get you to say anything.
[02:15:13.897 --> 02:15:15.521]  So, according to what I have read...
[02:15:16.266 --> 02:15:26.952]  Corsi got use immunity for some specific testimony against me, claiming that I had worked with him to concoct some cover story, which is false.
[02:15:27.312 --> 02:15:29.733]  Everything I have said about my tweet is true.
[02:15:30.173 --> 02:15:35.816]  Now, more importantly, however, where I think Corsi balked was in the next step.
[02:15:35.856 --> 02:15:41.639]  They wanted him to say that he or I received documents from WikiLeaks and passed them on to Donald Trump.
[02:15:41.959 --> 02:15:43.040]  That is false.
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:16:00.045]  So now we know and that makes sense because first he says okay I'm gonna plea and now he's not gonna plea and you saw him basically cheat Manafort get him to plead and then they're now double backing on him this is insane my lord will they have Corsi say that I'm a Russian agent
[02:16:02.276 --> 02:16:02.637]  Silver.
[02:16:03.137 --> 02:16:15.253]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act and as we prepare to close out 2018
[02:16:17.496 --> 02:16:25.841]  Isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[02:16:26.841 --> 02:16:33.505]  Or to say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man, well that's dead naming.
[02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:41.830]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[02:16:42.210 --> 02:16:45.372]  Then they say it's racist to say no, that it's okay to be white.
[02:16:45.712 --> 02:16:48.493]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation or borders.
[02:16:48.933 --> 02:16:51.613]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told, is evil.
[02:16:52.053 --> 02:16:55.694]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[02:16:56.554 --> 02:16:58.495]  World War III was the Cold War.
[02:16:59.875 --> 02:17:01.576]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[02:17:01.976 --> 02:17:07.857]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others,
[02:17:09.278 --> 02:17:27.644]  With the America-hating Hollywood crowd literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left because the globalists are threatened by first world nations, they're threatened by the middle class, they're threatened by the uppity-ness
[02:17:29.051 --> 02:17:30.292]  Of free market capitalism.
[02:17:30.892 --> 02:17:34.914]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[02:17:35.675 --> 02:17:37.296]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[02:17:37.736 --> 02:17:40.477]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[02:17:41.538 --> 02:17:42.879]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[02:17:42.959 --> 02:17:47.181]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[02:17:47.721 --> 02:17:50.483]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[02:17:51.988 --> 02:17:58.092]  But the globalists are counterstriking against independent patriot nationalist media like InfoWars.
[02:17:58.132 --> 02:18:08.059]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective, thanks to your support, you have been the most effective at exposing what's really happening.
[02:18:08.659 --> 02:18:12.942]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[02:18:13.422 --> 02:18:16.905]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[02:18:17.565 --> 02:18:21.528]  And I wanted just to remind you that InfoWars isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[02:18:22.749 --> 02:18:23.849]  And without you, we won't be here.
[02:18:24.470 --> 02:18:28.472]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[02:18:29.673 --> 02:18:32.015]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:32.475 --> 02:18:41.241]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[02:18:41.321 --> 02:18:44.023]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[02:18:44.503 --> 02:18:46.504]  A tax that would take an hour to go over, just some of it.
[02:18:47.324 --> 02:18:57.047]  But you standing with us and buying the great products at InfoWareStore.com helps you and it also helps us get the word out so it's symbiotic, a non-zero-sum game.
[02:18:57.627 --> 02:18:58.807]  The globalists are the opposite.
[02:18:58.847 --> 02:19:01.828]  They see everything as a win-lose proposition.
[02:19:02.488 --> 02:19:08.990]  And they are hyper-aggressive, hyper-alpha, to a point of absolute spiritual evil.
[02:19:09.671 --> 02:19:10.271]  So right now,
[02:19:10.891 --> 02:19:27.557]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding Infowars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[02:19:28.037 --> 02:19:39.281]  And you are provisioning and funding, not just the second American revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[02:19:40.101 --> 02:19:41.182]  Forced sterilization.
[02:19:41.542 --> 02:19:42.863]  Children being sterilized.
[02:19:43.344 --> 02:19:46.306]  This is pure, total, absolute evil.
[02:19:46.406 --> 02:19:50.149]  And Infowars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[02:19:50.449 --> 02:19:52.770]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny.
[02:19:53.051 --> 02:19:54.512]  And we will fight until the end.
[02:19:54.952 --> 02:19:57.234]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[02:19:57.294 --> 02:19:59.415]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[02:19:59.836 --> 02:20:00.956]  And thank you all for your support.
[02:20:01.197 --> 02:20:01.597]  God bless you.
[02:20:06.278 --> 02:20:10.742]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.086 --> 02:20:17.967]  You found it.
[02:20:18.307 --> 02:20:19.848]  The tip of the spear.
[02:20:20.329 --> 02:20:22.651]  It is The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.798 --> 02:20:38.427]  Well, this is the biggest flurry of action in the last two years of the ridiculous Russiagate fraud, where people actually involved, from Robert Mueller to Hillary Clinton, to her lawyer, who's the head of prosecution.
[02:20:39.868 --> 02:20:44.531]  Yes, the person leading the prosecution of Russiagate is involved in Russiagate.
[02:20:44.572 --> 02:20:49.735]  The head prosecutor is literally involved with the foundation for Hillary covering things up.
[02:20:50.436 --> 02:20:52.357]  They are now claiming Manafort
[02:20:54.628 --> 02:20:59.170]  Was at a secret meeting with Assange and I just left it in the break room.
[02:20:59.530 --> 02:21:01.430]  The Guardian's now backpedaling saying it's not true.
[02:21:03.611 --> 02:21:11.154]  This is just like when they said that General Flynn had admitted they were all Russian agents and it just totally wasn't true.
[02:21:11.354 --> 02:21:12.074]  It was a giant lie.
[02:21:12.594 --> 02:21:13.655]  Well now the Guardian
[02:21:15.067 --> 02:21:17.108]  Okay, maybe it didn't happen.
[02:21:17.488 --> 02:21:18.309]  This is unbelievable.
[02:21:18.369 --> 02:21:22.391]  And then now they've got an article in the Daily Caller of all places.
[02:21:22.911 --> 02:21:36.998]  Jerome Corsi says he has defense agreement with Trump, received limited immunity from Mueller, and made up the whole story of him figuring out that the WikiLeaks would be about Podesta and the campaign.
[02:21:38.621 --> 02:21:41.442]  Because they did get it, basically, from Wikileaks.
[02:21:41.622 --> 02:21:42.582]  Totally made up!
[02:21:42.822 --> 02:21:44.503]  And this is supposedly in some book!
[02:21:45.923 --> 02:21:47.764]  So, I mean, wow!
[02:21:47.864 --> 02:21:50.504]  And this fits with first, of course, he's in all these meetings.
[02:21:51.485 --> 02:21:52.645]  Then they're going to indict him.
[02:21:53.865 --> 02:21:55.866]  Then he says, okay, well, I'm not gonna lie.
[02:21:57.527 --> 02:22:01.428]  And then now, we're back hearing he will plea bargain.
[02:22:01.568 --> 02:22:03.468]  This is making my head spin.
[02:22:03.488 --> 02:22:05.849]  So let's go right through this, Roger.
[02:22:07.489 --> 02:22:09.192]  Yeah, it's really quite extraordinary.
[02:22:09.272 --> 02:22:19.968]  If you looked at the indictment of the 17 Russian intelligence officials, there is a paragraph that says a US-based journalist
[02:22:20.826 --> 02:22:32.557]  Well, that journalist is most certainly not Roger Stone or Alex Jones, that I can tell you.
[02:22:33.118 --> 02:22:35.259]  Was it Jerry Corsi and we don't know it?
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:37.041]  That's certainly a possibility.
[02:22:37.562 --> 02:22:43.167]  I find there's huge discrepancies between the online America
[02:22:44.307 --> 02:22:44.908]  We're good to go.
[02:23:09.441 --> 02:23:10.861]  Complete fiction.
[02:23:11.201 --> 02:23:12.982]  Why would I call Jerry Corsi?
[02:23:13.002 --> 02:23:15.922]  So see, Roger, I think my instincts are right about Corsi.
[02:23:16.682 --> 02:23:22.464]  Because, I'm not trying to be mean here, but we all know what happened when we were there with him earlier this year.
[02:23:23.064 --> 02:23:27.765]  I guess it was in, what was it, in January, it was in January, it was in February in D.C.
[02:23:28.045 --> 02:23:31.265]  for that press conference we had about the censorship and all the lawsuits.
[02:23:32.225 --> 02:23:34.246]  And I don't want to be mean to Corsi.
[02:23:35.148 --> 02:23:36.089]  Okay, I'm just going to leave it.
[02:23:36.129 --> 02:23:38.290]  But he was out of his gourd.
[02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:40.912]  And I have all the witnesses falling down.
[02:23:40.932 --> 02:23:42.473]  They were calling an ambulance.
[02:23:42.773 --> 02:23:43.733]  He'd stopped breathing.
[02:23:44.014 --> 02:23:45.855]  They had to put him in his hotel room bed.
[02:23:46.355 --> 02:23:48.016]  He didn't know who he was the next day.
[02:23:48.036 --> 02:23:49.477]  And I'm not trying to be mean.
[02:23:49.517 --> 02:23:54.000]  Then I see him in this OAN interview, sweating profusely, breathing heavily.
[02:23:54.020 --> 02:23:57.042]  And then now he's all over the map.
[02:23:57.142 --> 02:24:00.424]  I mean, I expect him to claim I wear a fur hat.
[02:24:02.225 --> 02:24:02.485]  You know?
[02:24:20.780 --> 02:24:23.581]  I know you were punched in the stomach when the Billy Bush thing came out.
[02:24:23.942 --> 02:24:26.783]  And we're, you know, off record, kind of like, my God, this may be it.
[02:24:26.843 --> 02:24:27.683]  And I said, buck up.
[02:24:28.004 --> 02:24:28.584]  This is nothing.
[02:24:28.644 --> 02:24:29.664]  It's a bunch of edited crap.
[02:24:29.684 --> 02:24:30.285]  Move forward.
[02:24:30.545 --> 02:24:32.006]  And I'm not trying to shoot my mouth off here.
[02:24:32.046 --> 02:24:33.106]  That's just what happened, Roger.
[02:24:33.286 --> 02:24:34.967]  This is a load of crap!
[02:24:35.607 --> 02:24:38.228]  And I am not involved with any stinking Russians.
[02:24:38.269 --> 02:24:38.829]  Go ahead, Roger.
[02:24:39.489 --> 02:24:40.449]  That's exactly right.
[02:24:40.610 --> 02:24:45.612]  I was despondent when the Billy Bush thing came down and you were the one who said, just steady the ship.
[02:24:45.672 --> 02:24:47.052]  This too will pass, you said.
[02:24:47.312 --> 02:24:48.413]  The country's too upset.
[02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:50.133]  And you turned out to be exactly right.
[02:24:50.674 --> 02:24:56.376]  So, look, Jerry Corsi's not going to make a very good witness for the government or anyone else because he's all over the map.
[02:24:56.576 --> 02:24:59.297]  And I'm not going to kiss his ass so he doesn't make stuff up.
[02:24:59.317 --> 02:25:00.898]  Just make up whatever you want with that.
[02:25:01.038 --> 02:25:01.818]  Criminal Mueller!
[02:25:01.959 --> 02:25:04.080]  That goddamn Russian agent Mueller!
[02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:05.941]  Excuse me, Lord, I apologize.
[02:25:06.101 --> 02:25:07.102]  Just, oh my God!
[02:25:07.562 --> 02:25:10.924]  Let them march in, that federal prosecutor that's involved with Russia!
[02:25:11.604 --> 02:25:14.706]  I hope, I can't wait to get in front of that damn grand jury!
[02:25:15.207 --> 02:25:16.547]  I am so sick of this crap!
[02:25:17.408 --> 02:25:19.429]  These are the damn traitors that hate the country!
[02:25:19.549 --> 02:25:21.050]  They're the ones selling us out!
[02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:23.231]  We're the American Patriots!
[02:25:23.271 --> 02:25:24.052]  So's Trump!
[02:25:24.272 --> 02:25:25.253]  And I'm sick of it!
[02:25:25.973 --> 02:25:28.314]  Sorry, I just, Roger, this is a real blow-up.
[02:25:28.394 --> 02:25:28.995]  I'm gonna stop now.
[02:25:30.157 --> 02:25:30.877]  Go ahead.
[02:25:31.378 --> 02:25:32.658]  Believe me, I know how you feel.
[02:25:32.718 --> 02:25:34.679]  I just verbalize it in a different way.
[02:25:35.399 --> 02:25:40.782]  Look, the whole thing is, we've lost sight of the fact that there is no Russian prosecutor.
[02:25:40.822 --> 02:25:43.323]  The prosecutor is a goddamn Russian agent!
[02:25:44.650 --> 02:25:45.951]  Excuse me, Lord, I'm sorry.
[02:25:45.971 --> 02:25:46.612]  I'm going to stop there.
[02:25:47.292 --> 02:25:53.938]  Dude, they've got Hillary's former bag lady at the foundation for Uranium One running the prosecute.
[02:25:54.238 --> 02:25:56.280]  It's hilarious if it wasn't so sick.
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:58.262]  These people are crazy!
[02:25:58.502 --> 02:25:59.643]  They have no shame!
[02:26:00.744 --> 02:26:00.924]  Sorry.
[02:26:00.944 --> 02:26:01.625]  Go ahead, Roger.
[02:26:02.641 --> 02:26:04.042]  And they see things that aren't there.
[02:26:04.182 --> 02:26:11.868]  So, if you read Jerry's book, there's an email between Jerry and me in which Jerry tells me that Podesta's emails have been stolen.
[02:26:12.108 --> 02:26:13.909]  But there is no such email.
[02:26:14.209 --> 02:26:15.510]  I've read the email in question.
[02:26:15.550 --> 02:26:17.432]  It doesn't say anything close to that.
[02:26:17.572 --> 02:26:22.095]  So these people get their exercise... Listen, we all... Let's just say it privately about Corsi.
[02:26:22.535 --> 02:26:24.036]  About a year ago, I said, I gotta let him go.
[02:26:24.076 --> 02:26:24.577]  He's crazy.
[02:26:25.077 --> 02:26:28.660]  Because on the phone and everything, he started believing all this QAnon crap.
[02:26:29.001 --> 02:26:32.604]  He started saying he was talking to the president when he wasn't, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:26:33.204 --> 02:26:36.387]  And he just is out to lunch, man.
[02:26:36.908 --> 02:26:38.589]  The guy has had a stroke or something.
[02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:41.973]  One day he can talk normal, the next day he doesn't know what planet he's on.
[02:26:42.593 --> 02:26:44.415]  I heard there's a demon involved named Rum.
[02:26:47.217 --> 02:26:47.618]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:49.837 --> 02:26:52.679]  It's very hard to figure out why he's all over the place.
[02:26:53.119 --> 02:26:54.160]  I do think he's drinking.
[02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:56.161]  He has a tendency to break down into tears.
[02:26:57.602 --> 02:27:01.565]  Oh, you think he's drinking when we had to carry him out of the Palm Steakhouse?
[02:27:02.506 --> 02:27:04.567]  Well, I could not distinguish.
[02:27:04.667 --> 02:27:08.310]  I mean, his interview yesterday with OAN was brilliant.
[02:27:08.962 --> 02:27:11.243]  Today he's saying the exact opposite in print.
[02:27:11.943 --> 02:27:13.904]  There's a total inconsistency there.
[02:27:14.745 --> 02:27:16.726]  So, look, it's more of the same.
[02:27:16.826 --> 02:27:25.109]  Bottom line, no Russian collusion, no WikiLeaks collaboration, no advanced knowledge of these Pocopta-Podesta emails.
[02:27:25.489 --> 02:27:26.710]  So what is this about?
[02:27:26.810 --> 02:27:29.931]  Now we're down to these tiny nitpicking perjury stuff?
[02:27:29.991 --> 02:27:33.173]  Oh, you were wearing a blue tie that day, but you said it was red?
[02:27:33.273 --> 02:27:35.414]  So, I mean, this has reached an absurd point.
[02:27:35.974 --> 02:27:47.362]  And it's run by a guy up to his eyeballs in real Russian collusion with a strategic uranium weapons stockpile, and the damn prosecutor literally is Hillary's bag woman!
[02:27:47.782 --> 02:27:58.349]  This would be like if I was a Jew at Nuremberg, and they were saying that I was going to prison for helping Hitler when I'd been persecuted, and then Hitler's the judge!
[02:27:58.369 --> 02:28:02.592]  I mean, why not make Hitler the judge at Nuremberg, Roger?
[02:28:03.615 --> 02:28:11.039]  Well, let's hope that Matthew Whitaker, the acting Attorney General, is listening, because he is the man who can put an end to this entire charade.
[02:28:11.519 --> 02:28:17.862]  Millions of dollars, two years of wasted time, no evidence of Russian collusion, because it's a distraction.
[02:28:18.162 --> 02:28:21.504]  It's a distraction from the crimes of the Obamas and the Clintons.
[02:28:21.824 --> 02:28:27.927]  It's a distraction from the fact that they used the power of the state to surveil Donald Trump's campaign for president.
[02:28:28.127 --> 02:28:40.215]  All because that little ugly weasel, Podesta, is pissed that we blocked the heir apparent, Her Highness, Wartface, from getting into power so she could really rape the hell out of this country.
[02:28:40.555 --> 02:28:44.018]  We've got our reporters on the border, Roger, but I want to come back in five more minutes with you.
[02:28:44.038 --> 02:28:47.380]  I'm going to let you host while I'm not here, because I won't be able to stop talking.
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:56.746]  I want to know about the stupid Manafort meeting with Julian Assange, who we're supposedly all in cahoots with, so he would never give us the time of day!
[02:28:58.127 --> 02:29:09.952]  Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens.
[02:29:10.633 --> 02:29:11.233]  Translation?
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:16.721]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[02:29:16.921 --> 02:29:25.243]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior.
[02:29:25.263 --> 02:29:31.245]  A high rating means you get benefits like no deposit of renting a house or skipping airport security.
[02:29:31.485 --> 02:29:35.186]  But a low score means you can't rent a car or apply for visas.
[02:29:35.526 --> 02:29:39.369]  The Chinese government expects to make this system mandatory in 2020.
[02:29:39.769 --> 02:29:43.933]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[02:29:43.973 --> 02:29:53.240]  The Chinese government, as people probably know, has a quite comprehensive internet censorship system set up and it's known as the Great Firewall.
[02:29:53.300 --> 02:30:00.486]  It blocks all kinds of information about, you know, political opponents of the ruling Communist Party regime there.
[02:30:00.747 --> 02:30:02.548]  All kinds of things that they're blocking out.
[02:30:02.628 --> 02:30:09.302]  Companies agreed to ban particular sites or search times on topics like human rights, democracy, and free speech.
[02:30:09.583 --> 02:30:11.186]  You know Google's really the CIA.
[02:30:12.759 --> 02:30:18.482]  But it's leftist run now, so it's brought over to China, and it's a civil war inside the intelligence agency.
[02:30:18.662 --> 02:30:27.087]  These are serious people plotting to finagle the searches, which is what Google sells to us as being fair and unbiased.
[02:30:27.207 --> 02:30:33.630]  Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any American election just by altering its search suggestions.
[02:30:34.071 --> 02:30:34.971]  We'd never know what happened.
[02:30:35.011 --> 02:30:44.538]  Well, Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[02:30:44.578 --> 02:30:46.340]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:57.088]  So Google won't work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, but it's officially moved its main operations for AI to China and is merging with the Chinese government, letting them have all the technology.
[02:30:57.288 --> 02:31:09.582]  So they're working on behalf of the fascist Chinese government, sending propaganda to its people to keep them under the control of the government, but we shouldn't worry about the fact that they have a chokehold on all human information in English.
[02:31:09.722 --> 02:31:10.322]  Not a big deal.
[02:31:11.023 --> 02:31:12.905]  I mean, that's a lot you just said there, but I...
[02:31:14.126 --> 02:31:21.611]  So Google always swears that its liberal, anti-Trump views of the top people doesn't affect the search product.
[02:31:22.112 --> 02:31:27.575]  But here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political actives.
[02:31:27.595 --> 02:31:32.198]  The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily.
[02:31:32.578 --> 02:31:36.541]  They have more than a million Muslims in re-education camps.
[02:31:36.941 --> 02:31:42.605]  But the legitimate election of President Trump somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values?
[02:31:43.206 --> 02:31:44.867]  Give me a break.
[02:31:45.107 --> 02:31:47.589]  Google was working to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[02:31:47.729 --> 02:31:59.177]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[02:31:59.297 --> 02:32:01.919]  A new bombshell development reveals Hillary Clinton's
[02:32:02.039 --> 02:32:08.221]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[02:32:18.604 --> 02:32:23.486]  They're outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[02:32:23.606 --> 02:32:33.511]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[02:32:33.651 --> 02:32:36.572]  You're not allowed to get the InfoWars official app on your iPhone?
[02:32:38.086 --> 02:32:41.728]  You're not allowed to watch the Alex Jones Show on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.
[02:32:42.509 --> 02:32:54.256]  But if you're the Chinese government and you want access to every citizen and all their data and everything they've ever done on an Apple product, good to go, baby.
[02:32:55.276 --> 02:32:55.857]  Good to go.
[02:32:56.597 --> 02:32:59.339]  And the left in America loves it.
[02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:09.062]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.067 --> 02:33:19.648]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:19.748 --> 02:33:24.872]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:30.189 --> 02:33:35.291]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Alex Jones, the most demonized, most lied-about talk show host in the country.
[02:33:36.291 --> 02:33:39.212]  Our president is under attack, and Roger Stone is with us.
[02:33:40.492 --> 02:33:46.654]  DrudgeReport.com has top-linked to this radio-slash-TV transmission right now, which I appreciate Drudge doing.
[02:33:46.754 --> 02:33:53.957]  Obviously, Roger Stone's top-linked on DrudgeReport.com with his statement that if the president could just be left alone to fix the country, he would not run again.
[02:33:55.086 --> 02:33:55.846]  Which I agree with.
[02:33:56.287 --> 02:33:59.028]  But then now we've got Manafort supposedly meeting with Assange.
[02:33:59.108 --> 02:34:02.870]  Already the London Guardian is backpedaling, changing their article, saying now they're not sure.
[02:34:02.890 --> 02:34:05.231]  That story's up on ZeroHedge.com.
[02:34:06.071 --> 02:34:14.015]  We have got this bizarreness with Dr. Jerome Corsi, who has worked for Infowars until about eight months ago.
[02:34:15.297 --> 02:34:22.621]  And I don't want to say mean things about Corsi, but I have experienced him basically what I would call dementia.
[02:34:23.661 --> 02:34:25.222]  I'm just going to be nice and leave it at that.
[02:34:26.123 --> 02:34:28.424]  And let's just stop there.
[02:34:29.204 --> 02:34:34.167]  But my security guys had to literally put him in his hotel bed.
[02:34:34.887 --> 02:34:36.508]  They called me and said we should call an ambulance.
[02:34:36.528 --> 02:34:37.449]  We believe he stopped breathing.
[02:34:38.610 --> 02:34:41.032]  I checked on him some more and said, no, let's just stand by.
[02:34:41.532 --> 02:34:42.813]  But I had to have people go check on him.
[02:34:43.254 --> 02:34:43.474]  Okay.
[02:34:43.814 --> 02:34:45.295]  So this is the stuff I'm dealing with.
[02:34:45.355 --> 02:34:51.820]  And I don't want to sit here and bring all this out on air, but I called Roger up and I said, I got to let him go because of this and all the rest of it.
[02:34:51.861 --> 02:34:54.603]  He's been a very talented guy, great Patriot, but.
[02:34:55.609 --> 02:35:08.797]  Now to have him supposedly in a book he's written that's coming out about how he's with the President and Stone and he's getting documents and he had a cover story with Stone after he's been all over the news denying this and saying he wouldn't lie.
[02:35:09.357 --> 02:35:10.578]  This is crazy.
[02:35:10.978 --> 02:35:12.139]  And then you get the Manafort thing.
[02:35:12.179 --> 02:35:14.901]  So Roger, you've got the floor for the next eight minutes until we go to break.
[02:35:15.581 --> 02:35:17.382]  And then my reporters are on the ground in Mexico.
[02:35:17.402 --> 02:35:18.103]  We're going to go to them live.
[02:35:18.143 --> 02:35:19.103]  And you've got to go to an interview.
[02:35:19.123 --> 02:35:22.946]  But for the world, here's your statement on, I think this Corsi thing's front and center.
[02:35:23.934 --> 02:35:30.762]  And then obviously, then this Manafort thing, this supposed meeting from the unreputable CNN and London Guardian.
[02:35:30.782 --> 02:35:32.303]  So Roger, set the record straight.
[02:35:32.363 --> 02:35:33.665]  The world is listening right now.
[02:35:34.466 --> 02:35:34.686]  Sure.
[02:35:35.107 --> 02:35:38.951]  And you know the White House follows Drudge live time, so the President will probably watch this.
[02:35:38.971 --> 02:35:40.012]  So what's your message to Trump?
[02:35:40.252 --> 02:35:41.654]  What's your message on record?
[02:35:42.472 --> 02:35:46.036]  Well, first of all, let's address the question of the president running for re-election.
[02:35:46.116 --> 02:35:55.385]  I think it is possible that he could be so successful in turning this country around in the next two years, if there are anything like the last two years, he may have achieved his agenda.
[02:35:55.665 --> 02:36:00.550]  He may be able to just ride off into the sunset as one of America's greatest presidents.
[02:36:00.770 --> 02:36:01.731]  That's all I was saying.
[02:36:02.251 --> 02:36:14.080]  Secondarily, the whole notion that Jerry Corsi and I concocted some cover story because my tweet of August 21st, the Podesta's time in the barrel was controversial is false.
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:16.682]  That didn't require any cover story.
[02:36:16.722 --> 02:36:18.443]  There was no congressional investigation.
[02:36:18.743 --> 02:36:20.244]  There was no Mueller investigation.
[02:36:20.304 --> 02:36:24.027]  And my tweet wasn't controversial until six weeks later.
[02:36:24.447 --> 02:36:42.141]  Everything I said before the House Intelligence Committee, that my tweet was based on research done by Jerry Corsi into the Russian business activities of the Podestas, all available from public sources, stands because it was truthful and correct then, and it is truthful and correct now.
[02:36:42.502 --> 02:36:47.746]  What's amazing, Alex, is what federal prosecutors can get you to do under extreme pressure.
[02:36:48.186 --> 02:36:53.770]  Of course he said repeatedly that he was being squeezed to adhere to a narrative that he didn't agree with.
[02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:54.751]  It wasn't true.
[02:36:55.131 --> 02:36:59.795]  Now suddenly he says, well, he took use immunity to testify against me.
[02:37:00.375 --> 02:37:01.416]  I know the truth.
[02:37:01.737 --> 02:37:03.898]  The truth is there is no Russian collusion.
[02:37:04.238 --> 02:37:06.220]  There is no WikiLeaks collaboration.
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:20.411]  There still is no proof whatsoever that I received anything from WikiLeaks or Guccifer or the Russians or anyone else, including allegedly stolen or hacked emails and passed them on to Donald Trump and the Trump campaign.
[02:37:20.832 --> 02:37:27.437]  So why Jerry Corsi has a joint defense agreement with the president is a question for Jerry Corsi.
[02:37:28.203 --> 02:37:31.126]  If he passed something on to the President, I don't know about it.
[02:37:31.506 --> 02:37:34.690]  If he got some documents, I'm unaware of it.
[02:37:35.050 --> 02:37:36.051]  It's just that simple.
[02:37:36.311 --> 02:37:37.633]  And now I'm Paul Manafort.
[02:37:38.193 --> 02:37:49.725]  If Paul Manafort met with Julian Assange in March of 2016, there would be surveillance camera video, there would be documentation in the log where you have to sign in.
[02:37:50.425 --> 02:37:52.686]  The Guardian admits that there is neither.
[02:37:53.426 --> 02:37:56.607]  Paul Manafort never met with Julian Assange in 2016.
[02:37:56.948 --> 02:37:59.709]  If he did, he certainly didn't mention it to me.
[02:38:00.069 --> 02:38:03.110]  This smells of fake news.
[02:38:04.366 --> 02:38:07.810]  Well, I'm going to pull that clip up of Joy Behar earlier this year going, yay!
[02:38:08.051 --> 02:38:11.214]  General Flynn admits that they're all Russian agents, Trump's going to prison, yay!
[02:38:11.815 --> 02:38:14.639]  All lies, all a hoax from ABC News.
[02:38:15.039 --> 02:38:18.764]  Put out on The View, put out by a disgraced reporter, Ross.
[02:38:19.204 --> 02:38:21.567]  And it's the same crud over and over again.
[02:38:21.587 --> 02:38:22.709]  The reason I'm so angry is
[02:38:23.249 --> 02:38:26.872]  As you know, you've talked to people that have been there, your lawyer, others, at the grand jury.
[02:38:26.892 --> 02:38:28.314]  They're bringing me up all the time.
[02:38:28.394 --> 02:38:32.397]  That's how I know this is to infinity horse manure.
[02:38:32.477 --> 02:38:38.042]  And then I haven't gone on record, but several times I've been approached by prominent people
[02:38:38.943 --> 02:38:50.559]  Literally saying, you know, the Russians want to give you money and crap, and then it leads right back to the neocons, right back to Mueller, right back to a national security letter, and I've gotten it all to the highest levels.
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:51.521]  I'll say that!
[02:38:52.001 --> 02:38:54.044]  And so, I have had enough of this crap!
[02:38:54.825 --> 02:38:58.126]  And it's Robert Mueller who's the agent with the tarmac and the uranium.
[02:38:58.347 --> 02:38:58.927]  It's Hillary.
[02:38:59.127 --> 02:39:00.507]  It's the prosecutor they have.
[02:39:01.148 --> 02:39:05.950]  Hillary's former head of her lawyer for her foundation that oversaw all this crud.
[02:39:06.470 --> 02:39:07.070]  It's insane.
[02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:15.313]  It's like having Al Capone raised from the dead and then come sit in an organized crime trial over me when I have no criminal record.
[02:39:15.914 --> 02:39:20.575]  It's like Hitler presiding as the chief judge at Nuremberg and then sending Jews to the gas chambers.
[02:39:20.996 --> 02:39:24.197]  I mean, it's upside-down, bizarro world, Roger.
[02:39:25.339 --> 02:39:28.041]  Well, and it's exactly why they want to shut Infowars down.
[02:39:28.641 --> 02:39:33.565]  They want to make sure that we don't have a platform to expose exactly what you just said.
[02:39:33.985 --> 02:39:42.511]  They don't want anyone pointing out that the Russian collusion delusion is a distraction from the real crimes of the Obamas and the Clintons.
[02:39:42.812 --> 02:39:44.513]  Crimes pertaining to surveillance.
[02:39:44.853 --> 02:39:48.676]  Crimes pertaining to their sale of our uranium reserves.
[02:39:49.156 --> 02:39:59.067]  So, it is, you're right, it's a Kafka-esque Alice in Wonderland world where the people who should be being prosecuted are doing the prosecuting.
[02:39:59.088 --> 02:40:03.733]  Well, I mean, listen, half my family fought the Russians and did all sorts of stuff.
[02:40:03.993 --> 02:40:05.153]  And the government knows that!
[02:40:05.213 --> 02:40:08.294]  They know that I'm not involved with foreign governments.
[02:40:09.214 --> 02:40:14.215]  But then they are, and then they turn it around on us, and I want Trump and Whitaker to take the gloves off.
[02:40:14.275 --> 02:40:17.376]  And it's not because I'm scared of these people, I'm scared for the country, man!
[02:40:17.776 --> 02:40:18.836]  These people are trash.
[02:40:18.876 --> 02:40:20.516]  Now, let's look at the minutes we have left.
[02:40:20.876 --> 02:40:23.057]  Your message to President Trump about what you think he should do.
[02:40:23.337 --> 02:40:26.678]  You said two years ago at the inauguration, illegal FISA, go after him on that.
[02:40:27.178 --> 02:40:28.598]  I mean, all of this stuff.
[02:40:28.738 --> 02:40:29.998]  Comey, lying to Congress.
[02:40:30.018 --> 02:40:33.259]  I mean, these people, we have them red-handed.
[02:40:34.645 --> 02:40:37.486]  Kevin Nunes said this two days ago, it was widely covered.
[02:40:37.986 --> 02:40:55.112]  President has information in his hands that he could declassify that would blow the entire cover on the Mueller, Obama, Clinton efforts to hijack the election and illegally and unconstitutionally use the surveillance power of the state.
[02:40:55.392 --> 02:41:01.034]  If he will simply declassify these documents, it will be Barack Obama's time in the barrel.
[02:41:03.413 --> 02:41:05.695]  Now, you told me weeks ago about that Nunes situation.
[02:41:05.715 --> 02:41:07.316]  I know you have high-level congressional contacts.
[02:41:07.376 --> 02:41:08.577]  You said, don't go with it yet.
[02:41:09.157 --> 02:41:12.139]  Now, I didn't even know Nunes had gone public, so that's good news.
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:13.540]  What is Trump waiting for?
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:16.382]  He needs to fire at will politically!
[02:41:16.642 --> 02:41:18.404]  He needs to launch the torpedoes!
[02:41:18.744 --> 02:41:19.424]  Ramming speed!
[02:41:19.465 --> 02:41:19.825]  Let's go!
[02:41:20.956 --> 02:41:34.528]  It's interesting that in the British press, there's a great deal of coverage over the fact that the government of the UK is really trying to pressure Trump not to declassify these documents, claiming that it shows their sources and methods.
[02:41:34.588 --> 02:41:41.114]  What it will really show is they were working with the Obama administration to spy on Donald Trump and his campaign.
[02:41:41.494 --> 02:41:43.196]  That is what is holding this up.
[02:41:43.356 --> 02:41:52.924]  Mr. President, ignore the Brits, ignore the Australians, declassify the information, let the American people see who the real criminals are.
[02:41:53.524 --> 02:41:59.850]  Because they're coming for you, they're coming, they have to discredit the nationalism, they're never going to leave you alone, they're going to sabotage the economy.
[02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:01.771]  You know what?
[02:42:01.851 --> 02:42:02.651]  I know Trump's going to do it.
[02:42:03.031 --> 02:42:05.732]  That's why they're so scared of Whitaker trying to undermine him right now.
[02:42:06.472 --> 02:42:08.913]  And we just have to be men and we have to take action.
[02:42:09.293 --> 02:42:11.154]  So basically everything we're seeing is bull.
[02:42:11.214 --> 02:42:12.615]  Manafort didn't meet with Assange.
[02:42:12.775 --> 02:42:13.715]  They're already backpedaling.
[02:42:16.956 --> 02:42:20.437]  Bragging about stuff that didn't go on has got himself in deep doo-doo with Mueller.
[02:42:21.138 --> 02:42:23.098]  And that's something we know Corsi started doing.
[02:42:23.719 --> 02:42:24.539]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[02:42:24.559 --> 02:42:25.959]  I mean, Corsi couldn't get his press passes.
[02:42:26.019 --> 02:42:27.300]  I had to get them through my sources.
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:29.201]  And sources right here close to home.
[02:42:29.241 --> 02:42:29.901]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:42:30.341 --> 02:42:35.243]  And I don't want to badmouth Corsi, but the point is he's been proven to be all over the map now and being deceitful.
[02:42:35.903 --> 02:42:43.726]  And I told you my instinct was, Roger, that he got his ass caught in a crack making crap up with all his writings and his QAnon crap.
[02:42:44.366 --> 02:42:47.451]  And that he was gonna throw you overboard, and you're like, oh no, he's a good guy.
[02:42:47.952 --> 02:42:50.235]  I think we... I'm just really upset.
[02:42:50.475 --> 02:42:51.337]  God bless you, Roger.
[02:42:51.357 --> 02:42:52.659]  We'll learn more as this unfolds.
[02:42:52.979 --> 02:42:56.024]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Stonecoldtruth.com.
[02:42:56.324 --> 02:42:58.007]  We'll be back with our reporters on the border.
[02:42:58.127 --> 02:42:59.369]  Stay with us.
[02:43:02.679 --> 02:43:12.927]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[02:43:13.308 --> 02:43:25.357]  And as we prepare to close out 2018, isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[02:43:26.331 --> 02:43:31.653]  What if you say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man?
[02:43:31.893 --> 02:43:33.133]  Well, that's dead naming.
[02:43:33.333 --> 02:43:41.376]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[02:43:41.736 --> 02:43:44.917]  Then they say it's racist to say, no, that it's okay to be white.
[02:43:45.257 --> 02:43:48.038]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation or borders.
[02:43:48.478 --> 02:43:51.159]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told is evil.
[02:43:51.599 --> 02:43:55.160]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[02:43:56.087 --> 02:43:58.028]  World War III was the Cold War.
[02:43:59.409 --> 02:44:01.109]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:19.118]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others, with the America-hating Hollywood crowd, literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left.
[02:44:20.856 --> 02:44:24.197]  The globalists are threatened by first world nations.
[02:44:24.217 --> 02:44:25.497]  They're threatened by the middle class.
[02:44:25.537 --> 02:44:29.858]  They're threatened by the uppity-ness of free market capitalism.
[02:44:30.438 --> 02:44:34.459]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[02:44:35.219 --> 02:44:36.819]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[02:44:37.279 --> 02:44:40.020]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:42.420]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:46.721]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[02:44:47.261 --> 02:44:50.002]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:57.613]  But the globalists are counter-striking against independent patriot nationalist media like InfoWars.
[02:44:57.674 --> 02:45:02.116]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective.
[02:45:02.156 --> 02:45:04.918]  Thanks to your support, you have been the most effective.
[02:45:06.042 --> 02:45:07.584]  At exposing what's really happening.
[02:45:08.184 --> 02:45:12.488]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[02:45:12.949 --> 02:45:16.452]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[02:45:17.033 --> 02:45:21.076]  And I wanted just to remind you that InfoWars isn't perfect but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[02:45:22.287 --> 02:45:23.407]  And without you, we won't be here.
[02:45:24.008 --> 02:45:27.989]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[02:45:29.210 --> 02:45:31.551]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:32.031 --> 02:45:40.795]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[02:45:40.875 --> 02:45:43.536]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[02:45:44.056 --> 02:45:46.057]  A tax would take an hour to go over just some of it.
[02:45:46.858 --> 02:45:53.921]  But you standing with us and buying the great products at Infowarsstore.com helps you and it also helps us get the word out.
[02:45:54.201 --> 02:45:56.603]  So it's symbiotic, a non-zero-sum game.
[02:45:57.163 --> 02:45:58.364]  The globalists are the opposite.
[02:45:58.404 --> 02:46:01.365]  They see everything as a win-lose proposition.
[02:46:02.046 --> 02:46:08.549]  And they are hyper-aggressive, hyper-alpha to a point of absolute spiritual evil.
[02:46:09.209 --> 02:46:09.830]  So right now,
[02:46:10.430 --> 02:46:27.093]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding InfoWars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[02:46:27.593 --> 02:46:38.815]  And you are provisioning and funding not just the second American revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[02:46:39.635 --> 02:46:40.716]  Forced sterilization.
[02:46:41.096 --> 02:46:42.397]  Children being sterilized.
[02:46:42.878 --> 02:46:45.840]  This is pure, total, absolute evil.
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:49.683]  And InfoWars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[02:46:50.003 --> 02:46:52.324]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny.
[02:46:52.585 --> 02:46:54.066]  And we will fight until the end.
[02:46:54.506 --> 02:46:56.788]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[02:46:56.848 --> 02:46:58.969]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[02:46:59.350 --> 02:47:00.510]  And thank you all for your support.
[02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:01.151]  God bless you.
[02:47:06.278 --> 02:47:10.421]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:24.472 --> 02:47:27.274]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:44.531 --> 02:47:47.534]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[02:47:47.695 --> 02:47:55.884]  What incredible information with Dr. Jerome Corsi and a book he's written coming out.
[02:47:56.805 --> 02:47:58.046]  Daily Caller reporting this.
[02:47:58.687 --> 02:48:03.292]  That he and Roger were basically working with WikiLeaks and had cover stories and were working with Trump.
[02:48:05.663 --> 02:48:06.824]  Good God!
[02:48:06.984 --> 02:48:17.294]  And I guess they then had concocted the story where he kept saying, I will testify, I won't testify, I will plea, I won't plea, I won't lie, I won't lie, so that when it comes out, it sounds believable?
[02:48:18.855 --> 02:48:20.577]  Or is Corsi just out of his mind?
[02:48:21.758 --> 02:48:24.020]  Or is the Daily Caller lying and this didn't happen?
[02:48:25.321 --> 02:48:26.702]  Talk about sensational!
[02:48:27.623 --> 02:48:30.166]  Meanwhile, Trump knows that General Motors
[02:48:31.516 --> 02:48:34.377]  Trump has made record profits and never paid the U.S.
[02:48:34.397 --> 02:48:36.497]  government back for the tens of billions Obama gave them.
[02:48:37.477 --> 02:48:38.017]  And what do they do?
[02:48:38.057 --> 02:48:40.758]  They lay off a bunch of people at an Ohio plant they're going to close.
[02:48:40.838 --> 02:48:45.179]  And Kudlow, his chief advisor, was just pointing out, Trump may take away the subsidies that GM has.
[02:48:45.579 --> 02:48:48.579]  Yeah, how about you pay back all the money you got in the bailout?
[02:48:50.039 --> 02:48:57.921]  And how about you don't buy back a bunch of your stock and pay yourself, these executives, 10, 20, 30 million dollar bonuses?
[02:48:59.099 --> 02:49:00.661]  These people are jerks.
[02:49:01.381 --> 02:49:03.163]  And they're a bunch of globalists and a bunch of leftists.
[02:49:03.203 --> 02:49:10.511]  And there's our president, acting like a real blue-collar classic democrat, saying, you need to get your ass in there and keep that factory open.
[02:49:10.531 --> 02:49:11.512]  You've got plenty of orders.
[02:49:12.433 --> 02:49:14.135]  Stop making your parts in China.
[02:49:14.836 --> 02:49:16.958]  And their answer is, you're being mean to us.
[02:49:17.478 --> 02:49:18.459]  These people make me sick.
[02:49:19.661 --> 02:49:21.683]  These globalists go out of their way to piss on this nation.
[02:49:23.837 --> 02:49:24.699]  And where are the labor unions?
[02:49:24.719 --> 02:49:29.971]  Where are all the Democrats thanking him for jobs and sticking up for America and wages going up?
[02:49:30.994 --> 02:49:31.575]  No, they don't care.
[02:49:31.595 --> 02:49:33.199]  They just want to call him a racist and feel good.
[02:49:33.559 --> 02:49:33.940]  Idiots!
[02:49:35.302 --> 02:49:39.105]  Now, our reporters, Greg Rees and Crew, are down at the U.S.
[02:49:39.125 --> 02:49:39.545]  side of the border.
[02:49:39.565 --> 02:49:47.130]  They've been back and forth in Mexico, and they've got some bombshell insider intel in the next two days that they're going to assault with a bigger force.
[02:49:47.150 --> 02:49:48.051]  It's just been a probe.
[02:49:48.451 --> 02:49:54.895]  Greg did a very important report that's up on Infowars.com, titled Breaking Eminent Invasion at U.S.
[02:49:54.915 --> 02:49:55.495]  Southern Border.
[02:49:55.936 --> 02:49:58.037]  The first attack Saturday was just a probe.
[02:49:58.477 --> 02:50:00.259]  And so, Greg Rees, great job, you and Drew.
[02:50:01.439 --> 02:50:03.961]  Of course, Trump has closed some of those border bridges.
[02:50:04.261 --> 02:50:05.102]  Tell us what you see there.
[02:50:07.384 --> 02:50:19.132]  Well we've been spending our time here around the border and it's interesting because just a couple days ago hundreds were trying to illegally pass and tear gas is blown off but last night and today it's business as usual.
[02:50:19.493 --> 02:50:23.476]  It's rather quiet and we've been talking to a lot of the people passing through the border.
[02:50:23.556 --> 02:50:29.300]  Most of them don't speak English and thanks to our InfoWars translator down here we've been able to speak to a lot of them.
[02:50:30.689 --> 02:50:33.231]  And they all feel the same way, basically.
[02:50:33.251 --> 02:50:36.214]  They all feel that they're upset with the migrants.
[02:50:36.734 --> 02:50:39.997]  They're upset how it's been impeding on their personal lives.
[02:50:40.117 --> 02:50:43.259]  One woman we spoke to was stuck over in America.
[02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:47.843]  She's a Mexican and she couldn't cross back over because of the shenanigans happening on Sunday.
[02:50:48.784 --> 02:50:52.767]  A lot of them expressed their support for Trump and what President Trump is doing.
[02:50:53.768 --> 02:50:59.413]  One woman was saying how she's just sick of people talking about wanting free stuff and how people need to understand that they need to work
[02:51:00.439 --> 02:51:01.339]  Uh, for what they earn.
[02:51:01.739 --> 02:51:08.081]  And so what we're hearing is just common sense from the other side of the border, the same way that a lot of Americans feel and a lot of people everywhere in the world feels.
[02:51:09.121 --> 02:51:11.542]  So it's been refreshing to get that perspective.
[02:51:12.282 --> 02:51:15.943]  Now, I know we're going to have you hook up with some folks on both sides of the border.
[02:51:16.283 --> 02:51:21.984]  We've got military contacts, ICE contacts, and Mexican contacts that are very, uh, uh, trusted.
[02:51:22.664 --> 02:51:28.746]  And you're, you know, I'm not going to say operationally what you guys are going to be doing, but we've been told by three different sources now
[02:51:29.466 --> 02:51:47.037]  That they expect in two to three days, and that was yesterday, so that means the next two days, for the main group, it's over 10,000 I now believe, it's already shown up, it was 2,000 a couple weeks ago, 5,000 this weekend, and that they expect 10,000 plus to try to rush, and that they want images of children getting hurt to then blame Trump.
[02:51:47.097 --> 02:51:48.317]  That's the narrative the media's putting out.
[02:51:48.638 --> 02:51:57.023]  Not illegal aliens coming up from other countries, a lot of these kids are kidnapped, the president is correct, they're using them as human shields, but the whole corporate press
[02:51:58.234 --> 02:52:00.075]  is saying the president's a liar.
[02:52:00.855 --> 02:52:06.498]  And then I guess he's supposed to capitulate and just say the border's totally open to anybody that wants to come here.
[02:52:07.599 --> 02:52:11.741]  Alexander Cortez is out there saying the very same thing.
[02:52:12.442 --> 02:52:14.803]  So what's your view on that, Greg Reeson?
[02:52:15.063 --> 02:52:15.983]  What are the locals telling you?
[02:52:17.464 --> 02:52:22.667]  Well, yeah, around the election time when this caravan started, I thought it was an election stunt.
[02:52:23.337 --> 02:52:30.682]  And maybe it's because I didn't want to accept the reality of it, but now it seems very clear that what we're about to get here is what's happened in Europe, in Germany, in Sweden, France.
[02:52:31.822 --> 02:52:34.884]  It seems very clear that that's about to be what happens.
[02:52:35.225 --> 02:52:41.409]  We're meeting up with one of our sources later this afternoon who's going to fill us up on some of the latest intel from Tijuana's side.
[02:52:41.829 --> 02:52:46.952]  And that's what she's telling us is that it was a test, Sunday was a test, and that they're planning a much bigger invasion.
[02:52:47.893 --> 02:52:49.954]  It seems like Sunday was just a probe.
[02:52:50.905 --> 02:52:53.005]  And you can clearly see it with the mainstream media.
[02:52:53.385 --> 02:52:59.527]  There's only one picture I think I've seen of any women and children, and that's the one that they're running with on the mainstream media, talking about tear-gassing people.
[02:53:00.407 --> 02:53:04.907]  It's crazy that we're actually seeing this happen in real time in our own country now.
[02:53:07.028 --> 02:53:13.109]  And of course, we will crop that photo for everybody, and don't show that it was a staged photo of the woman with the kids.
[02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:19.470]  But I guess it's less staged than, you know, Trump standing over a little girl, taking her away from her mommy, like we saw last year, which wasn't true either.
[02:53:23.018 --> 02:53:24.579]  Well, we got a lot of the same.
[02:53:24.599 --> 02:53:30.881]  A lot of the Mexicans over here were saying Trump's doing the right thing and they appreciate what Trump's doing and they don't want the migrants there either.
[02:53:31.242 --> 02:53:33.323]  They want their lives back.
[02:53:33.523 --> 02:53:44.407]  They don't want all the extra danger and basically an invading army camping out in their town right now in Tijuana, causing all kinds of mayhem.
[02:53:44.708 --> 02:53:45.468]  Child smuggling.
[02:53:46.278 --> 02:53:47.680]  All kinds of real bad stuff's going on.
[02:54:04.861 --> 02:54:13.027]  They got smuggled in that Obama let in without IDs, were taken and sold into slavery, sex slavery, sweatshops, you name it.
[02:54:13.067 --> 02:54:14.829]  That's all mainstream news.
[02:54:14.869 --> 02:54:17.431]  Here, let me show TV viewers, radio listeners, I'll read it to you.
[02:54:17.811 --> 02:54:19.292]  Here's the Washington Post two years ago.
[02:54:19.372 --> 02:54:21.854]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers.
[02:54:22.174 --> 02:54:22.695]  Senate report.
[02:54:24.193 --> 02:54:24.413]  U.S.
[02:54:24.433 --> 02:54:24.913]  Border Chief.
[02:54:24.933 --> 02:54:29.376]  Caravan use women, children, and human children for rocking agents, which is a fact.
[02:54:29.776 --> 02:54:32.837]  Donald Trump warns of migrant grabbers of children at the border.
[02:54:32.877 --> 02:54:33.578]  Media attacks him.
[02:54:34.078 --> 02:54:34.178]  U.S.
[02:54:34.218 --> 02:54:36.439]  place immigrant children with traffickers report says.
[02:54:36.459 --> 02:54:36.999]  New York Times.
[02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:38.440]  Unindependent.
[02:54:38.660 --> 02:54:40.561]  100 children grabbed by the caravan.
[02:54:42.335 --> 02:54:46.159]  Goes on and on and on, but Cortez never talks about that.
[02:54:46.279 --> 02:54:46.759]  Oh, no, no.
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:48.501]  No, no, no.
[02:54:48.761 --> 02:54:52.304]  Report reveals shame of UN peacekeepers and child sex rings.
[02:54:52.344 --> 02:54:52.865]  The Guardian.
[02:54:53.445 --> 02:54:54.346]  AP exclusive.
[02:54:54.426 --> 02:54:56.508]  UN child sex ring left victims but no arrests.
[02:54:56.888 --> 02:54:58.450]  Thousands missing, hundreds dead.
[02:54:58.670 --> 02:54:59.851]  Dead children.
[02:55:00.231 --> 02:55:01.553]  UN sex trafficking whistleblower.
[02:55:02.393 --> 02:55:05.157]  80% of Central American women and girls rape crossing into the U.S.
[02:55:05.497 --> 02:55:06.118]  in Mexico.
[02:55:06.218 --> 02:55:07.039]  Not by America.
[02:55:07.299 --> 02:55:10.884]  Not by Don Johnson and Robert Rodriguez's machete.
[02:55:11.224 --> 02:55:15.690]  Machete only acts like a tough, you know, boxer, you know, vato guy.
[02:55:15.970 --> 02:55:19.234]  He doesn't get out there and he doesn't actually, uh, you know...
[02:55:19.594 --> 02:55:22.497]  Talk about how the women are getting murdered down there.
[02:55:22.517 --> 02:55:29.064]  They just glorify the cartels and glorify with Robert Rodriguez and his Obama money to put out race-based politics.
[02:55:29.284 --> 02:55:31.927]  And then they show Don Johnson shooting a Mexican woman in the gut.
[02:55:32.127 --> 02:55:36.051]  No, no, how it works is the Mexican women get raped and murdered by the Mexicans.
[02:55:36.872 --> 02:55:37.852]  And see, that's what goes on.
[02:55:37.892 --> 02:55:39.493]  But see, we're not supposed to say that, Greg Reese.
[02:55:39.513 --> 02:55:40.913]  We're supposed to say, America's bad.
[02:55:41.113 --> 02:55:54.156]  Because a big, fat, evil, racist pig, like Robert Rodriguez, raised by liberal white people, who gave him the money for school and everything, and then he pisses all over it, I happen to know him, and hates white people, and is now a vicious, hateful, racist pig!
[02:55:54.817 --> 02:55:58.478]  A big, fat guy worth $100 million, who pisses all over America.
[02:55:58.518 --> 02:55:59.418]  What a piece of crap!
[02:55:59.598 --> 02:56:00.218]  What do you say to that?
[02:56:01.348 --> 02:56:11.931]  Well, this is when we need to really start hammering it out, Alex, because right now they're using crazy Orwellian psychological warfare on us, using the term globalism as if it's some type of utopia.
[02:56:12.332 --> 02:56:15.713]  But anyone who's critically thinking can look at this and see it's exactly the opposite.
[02:56:15.753 --> 02:56:17.113]  It's completely upside down world.
[02:56:17.733 --> 02:56:21.074]  And, you know, thanks to all of our fans and our audience for spreading the links.
[02:56:21.114 --> 02:56:22.695]  We're actually really starting to break through.
[02:56:24.136 --> 02:56:26.256]  We don't have NGOs supporting us.
[02:56:26.457 --> 02:56:28.437]  You know, we have boots on the ground here right at the border.
[02:56:28.477 --> 02:56:29.538]  We have a translator with us.
[02:56:29.998 --> 02:56:31.219]  We're meeting up with multiple sources.
[02:56:31.239 --> 02:56:32.279]  We're going to be going into the border.
[02:56:32.319 --> 02:56:33.920]  We couldn't do any of this without our fans.
[02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:35.881]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:56:36.541 --> 02:56:41.863]  We couldn't appreciate more for all of our fans and our audience going to Infowarstore.com to help support us.
[02:56:41.883 --> 02:56:43.144]  You know, Greg, I'm glad you say that.
[02:56:43.164 --> 02:56:44.865]  Let's do five more minutes and Watson takes over.
[02:56:45.700 --> 02:56:48.884]  I should be pointing out, I need to hire more reporters like you and Drew.
[02:56:49.024 --> 02:56:49.945]  I need bigger teams.
[02:56:50.586 --> 02:56:54.110]  I'm sending reporters somewhere I can't mention right now, and that's all we've got.
[02:56:54.570 --> 02:57:04.521]  We need more money, we need to hire more people, we need to get funding, and right now we have cyber week sales, extended Black Friday, biggest sales ever, everything must go, clearance sale.
[02:57:05.382 --> 02:57:18.015]  Cyber Week, 50% off, storewide free shipping, double Patriot points from 5 to 10%, the Alexa Pure Pro, incredible, never had a deal like that, $127, that's absolutely to clear it out for the end of the year so they don't get hit with inventory tax.
[02:57:18.716 --> 02:57:22.099]  That is an amazing system, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:22.119 --> 02:57:23.961]  I kind of went wild earlier with the Corsi thing.
[02:57:28.456 --> 02:57:31.917]  Because, you know, he's acting like, oh, I'm not going to lie for Mueller.
[02:57:31.937 --> 02:57:38.760]  And then now we learn he's written a book just full of absolute Alice in Wonderland fantasy world.
[02:57:40.021 --> 02:57:45.603]  And so it looks like Mueller finally found somebody who will just make up whatever they want.
[02:57:45.623 --> 02:57:50.045]  I mean, I hope that's not the case, but my God, they'll probably say I'm married to Vladimir Putin, which I'm not.
[02:57:53.199 --> 02:57:58.316]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:58:00.635 --> 02:58:02.196]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[02:58:02.236 --> 02:58:02.837]  It's a good thing.
[02:58:02.877 --> 02:58:06.099]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:09.082]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[02:58:09.102 --> 02:58:10.183]  I learned what the best was.
[02:58:10.863 --> 02:58:24.114]  And Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[02:58:24.614 --> 02:58:29.578]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[02:58:29.758 --> 02:58:34.203]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[02:58:34.683 --> 02:58:37.066]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[02:58:37.747 --> 02:58:42.112]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[02:58:43.783 --> 02:58:45.484]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:58:46.265 --> 02:58:48.527]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[02:58:48.547 --> 02:58:49.968]  That's when you get the best deals on cars.
[02:58:50.408 --> 02:58:55.973]  It's when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[02:58:56.173 --> 02:58:58.875]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[02:58:59.476 --> 02:59:00.717]  And that's not counting state taxes.
[02:59:00.737 --> 02:59:01.457]  A lot of states have.
[02:59:01.597 --> 02:59:02.438]  Texas has that too.
[02:59:02.938 --> 02:59:04.660]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax.
[02:59:04.680 --> 02:59:06.701]  That's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[02:59:07.262 --> 02:59:10.084]  So he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:59:12.625 --> 02:59:16.609]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[02:59:16.989 --> 02:59:19.072]  We normally sell for $249, it's a great deal.
[02:59:19.672 --> 02:59:22.815]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[02:59:23.156 --> 02:59:23.476]  It's $127!
[02:59:24.197 --> 02:59:28.000]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[02:59:28.917 --> 02:59:29.998]  I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[02:59:30.058 --> 02:59:32.139]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[02:59:32.199 --> 02:59:33.179]  I mean, I'm all for great deals.
[02:59:33.339 --> 02:59:34.380]  This is insane.
[02:59:34.740 --> 02:59:36.501]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:59:36.921 --> 02:59:38.902]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family.
[02:59:38.922 --> 02:59:40.303]  Get the best, the best deal.
[02:59:40.683 --> 02:59:42.904]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[02:59:43.004 --> 02:59:43.524]  It's amazing.
[02:59:43.605 --> 02:59:49.648]  Alexa Pure Pro at Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:53.792 --> 02:59:59.736]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:16.147 --> 03:00:20.169]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:26.860 --> 03:00:33.724]  Dear TV viewer, you can see our cameras are trained on the San Diego-Tijuana border.
[03:00:34.224 --> 03:00:42.328]  And you can see there in the foreground the main migrant caravan arriving in the form of a giant Trojan horse piñata.
[03:00:44.049 --> 03:00:49.012]  CNN will probably run that and have Snopes go, fake news, Jones showed a giant piñata and said it was real.
[03:00:49.112 --> 03:00:50.233]  It's called a joke.
[03:00:51.133 --> 03:00:52.274]  It's called a joke.
[03:00:55.562 --> 03:00:57.243]  And the crew have filed some amazing reports.
[03:00:57.283 --> 03:00:59.683]  More reports are going to be filed tonight and tomorrow.
[03:01:00.484 --> 03:01:04.025]  There was a probe Sunday, where about a couple thousand tried to get over the border.
[03:01:04.465 --> 03:01:07.105]  And they later admitted some did get across and get arrested.
[03:01:07.606 --> 03:01:09.686]  And that means then they can go before a judge and get released.
[03:01:09.726 --> 03:01:10.346]  That's the problem.
[03:01:10.606 --> 03:01:12.487]  The president doesn't control these out-of-control judges.
[03:01:13.767 --> 03:01:18.569]  And 35 million people have made it into the country illegally and are being organized by the Democrats.
[03:01:18.589 --> 03:01:18.929]  So Greg,
[03:01:21.078 --> 03:01:26.184]  Other points, obviously we don't give away what we're going to be doing, but there's big stuff coming tonight, tomorrow, the next few days.
[03:01:27.706 --> 03:01:33.993]  Well yeah, we're meeting up with some of our sources who have a lot of great intel for us, and we're looking forward to getting filled in on everything that's going on.
[03:01:35.234 --> 03:01:39.339]  The other thing I noticed is, as you're walking along the border fence,
[03:01:40.543 --> 03:01:47.746]  Last night and today and so far as the whole time we've been here, you can see construction workers reinforcing the fence, welding it.
[03:01:47.966 --> 03:01:50.907]  There's a fresh concertina wire all along the top.
[03:01:51.607 --> 03:01:58.769]  A lot of activity, a lot of fortification, and still so quiet for such a crazy time right now.
[03:01:58.789 --> 03:02:04.151]  I mean, when you look at what's happened in Europe and you can see that's about to happen here, it's an ominous silence almost.
[03:02:05.061 --> 03:02:10.806]  I'm kind of looking forward to getting into the Tijuana side more because I have a feeling things are a bit more hectic over there.
[03:02:10.986 --> 03:02:12.408]  That's where everything sort of camped out.
[03:02:12.448 --> 03:02:15.250]  Well yeah, over 10,000 now robbing, stealing.
[03:02:15.290 --> 03:02:17.252]  The Mexicans are trying to deport as many as they can.
[03:02:17.272 --> 03:02:19.054]  The first 97 being deported today.
[03:02:19.374 --> 03:02:23.838]  These are criminals trying to bust our border using children as human shields now.
[03:02:24.078 --> 03:02:25.920]  Now we've got National Guard, that's Army.
[03:02:26.700 --> 03:02:28.881]  Uh, and then we've got the regular army out there.
[03:02:28.921 --> 03:02:31.102]  I know the Marines have always been on the border secretly.
[03:02:31.462 --> 03:02:32.543]  That's no big secret.
[03:02:32.583 --> 03:02:34.344]  Anybody that knows, you're a former Marine yourself.
[03:02:35.064 --> 03:02:37.305]  Uh, what other forces have you seen down there?
[03:02:38.626 --> 03:02:39.546]  It's been fairly quiet.
[03:02:39.566 --> 03:02:40.647]  We see a lot of border patrol.
[03:02:40.687 --> 03:02:41.467]  You see, uh...
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:45.361]  Honestly, not as many as I would have expected to see.
[03:02:45.381 --> 03:02:52.484]  It is San Diego, it's a Marine Corps town, one of the biggest Marine Corps towns in the country, so there's plenty of military here.
[03:02:52.504 --> 03:02:58.267]  I would like to hope that there is some plans going on to help defend from this.
[03:02:58.965 --> 03:03:06.727]  I think it's a great opportunity for the Mexican government to get on a friendly side with America and maybe help us out, as we've been hearing stories about them doing.
[03:03:07.307 --> 03:03:10.268]  I'm not sure exactly what they're doing, but we've been hearing some good things about what they're doing.
[03:03:10.288 --> 03:03:14.849]  Well, there's a lot of double talk, but the local governors and police and others know you can't have a broken border.
[03:03:14.889 --> 03:03:15.649]  Your country's gone.
[03:03:16.049 --> 03:03:18.170]  They've got a strong border with Guatemala.
[03:03:18.230 --> 03:03:19.090]  It's been smashed.
[03:03:19.830 --> 03:03:27.656]  And so they understand they need to have self-preservation, but the socialist president has basically been putting a lot of double-talk out.
[03:03:27.876 --> 03:03:37.244]  He doesn't want Trump to cut the tens of billions off a year we give him, but at the same time, you know, he wants to sit there and virtue-signal and be part of this larger, you know, communist international.
[03:03:38.024 --> 03:03:39.766]  But, you know, we're talking about smuggled children.
[03:03:39.786 --> 03:03:40.807]  We're talking about the UN here.
[03:03:41.207 --> 03:03:45.650]  Trump needs to cut the funding off the UN immediately that goes to George Soros.
[03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:45.791]  That's
[03:03:46.471 --> 03:03:50.555]  What really scared them when Lou Dobbs talked about that and Soros tried to get Lou Dobbs fired.
[03:03:50.895 --> 03:03:51.636]  Because it's true.
[03:03:51.976 --> 03:03:52.697]  That's the key.
[03:03:52.977 --> 03:03:54.158]  Cut the head off of the snake.
[03:03:56.541 --> 03:04:00.424]  Start realizing that they're basically trying to set a precedent here.
[03:04:01.145 --> 03:04:04.668]  If they can get thousands of people through the border, that sets a new precedent.
[03:04:04.708 --> 03:04:08.552]  Not just for open borders, but for human smuggling.
[03:04:09.238 --> 03:04:16.719]  If we can allow that to happen without bringing justice to it, it's beginning to start a new precedent that's very, very dark.
[03:04:17.219 --> 03:04:17.599]  Well, you're right.
[03:04:17.619 --> 03:04:19.320]  That precedent started with Obama.
[03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:22.980]  Just saying, you get here, nobody checks you, we load you on Democrat buses.
[03:04:23.380 --> 03:04:23.740]  Wow!
[03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:24.581]  What a surprise!
[03:04:24.961 --> 03:04:29.822]  Hundreds of thousands of people coming across, millions over those years, and a bunch of them were kids and women being trafficked.
[03:04:29.922 --> 03:04:30.282]  Wow!
[03:04:30.942 --> 03:04:36.003]  You think some guy strong-arming a couple women or four or five guys with a woman and a couple kids, strong-arming them?
[03:04:36.283 --> 03:04:38.523]  The woman's got bruises all over her face, you don't even ask questions.
[03:04:38.723 --> 03:04:39.784]  Hey, coming to America!
[03:04:39.804 --> 03:04:40.925]  And the guy's like, carry on with me!
[03:04:41.265 --> 03:04:43.247]  And of course, he's taking her to a slave dungeon.
[03:04:43.948 --> 03:04:44.468]  Unbelievable.
[03:04:44.528 --> 03:04:46.830]  Well, Greg Reeves and crew, be safe out there.
[03:04:47.071 --> 03:04:49.493]  The War Room's coming up later at 3 o'clock Central, an hour.
[03:04:49.753 --> 03:04:50.454]  You'll have updates.
[03:04:50.534 --> 03:04:55.278]  Paul Joseph Watson, from Her Britannic Majesty's London, is on the other side.
[03:04:55.659 --> 03:04:58.521]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar.
[03:04:58.761 --> 03:04:59.662]  Spread those links.
[03:04:59.902 --> 03:05:01.144]  It's an act of rebellion.
[03:05:13.524 --> 03:05:19.788]  After the success of Alpha Power, we decided to make a new powerhouse vitality formula built with the female biochemistry in mind.
[03:05:20.528 --> 03:05:25.391]  After searching for the incredible ingredients to meet those needs, we're proud to bring you Ultimate Female Force.

[03:05:37.098 --> 03:05:40.760]  That's why Ultimate Female Force is such a powerhouse formula.

[03:06:14.511 --> 03:06:28.364]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:28.424 --> 03:06:32.648]  Last night the little dancer, she came a-dancing to my home.
[03:06:36.754 --> 03:06:42.297]  All right, Paul Watson is taking over this hour of the transmission as he does every Tuesday.
[03:06:42.317 --> 03:06:46.539]  The fourth hour is always a grab bag of some of our best guests and in-force crew.
[03:06:46.559 --> 03:06:51.002]  Then the War Room with Owen Schroeder is in 54 minutes from now.
[03:06:52.483 --> 03:07:02.809]  We had one of those rare drudge links at the top today when Roger Stone was responding to the story out of context that he is saying that Trump's not going to run for office.
[03:07:05.350 --> 03:07:15.854]  Again, and also that Corsi has a book coming out where he's a secret agent with Trump and they're all working with Assange and all the rest of it.
[03:07:16.594 --> 03:07:18.775]  Sounds like all this talk about he won't tell a lie.
[03:07:20.876 --> 03:07:31.305]  Is either some type of dementia, or it's a cover story so that when this outrageous lie comes out, people then believe it.
[03:07:31.385 --> 03:07:33.507]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[03:07:34.187 --> 03:07:37.790]  Mueller finally found somebody, I guess, that'll make stuff up.
[03:07:39.191 --> 03:07:40.533]  My head is spinning at this point.
[03:07:41.653 --> 03:07:45.096]  And it's... I've known Corsi probably 14, 15 years, longer than that.
[03:07:45.116 --> 03:07:48.900]  And he's done so much good work, and I've admired Corsi, but he just...
[03:07:49.938 --> 03:07:52.241]  Mentally degenerated about a year ago.
[03:07:53.143 --> 03:07:54.184]  And I've talked about that.
[03:07:55.025 --> 03:07:57.288]  And now, but it's weird how the brain works.
[03:07:57.308 --> 03:07:58.370]  Sometimes he's dead on.
[03:07:59.091 --> 03:08:02.195]  Other times he's just a gibbering idiot.
[03:08:02.896 --> 03:08:05.259]  And you know it's not just the demon alcohol.
[03:08:07.601 --> 03:08:11.043]  It's something else, and I just brace, I guess.
[03:08:11.063 --> 03:08:16.607]  I don't have any fear, though, because it's like bracing to hear I'm gonna get indicted for robbing a bank or something.
[03:08:16.847 --> 03:08:18.809]  I've never robbed a bank, never thought about robbing a bank.
[03:08:19.289 --> 03:08:26.874]  But, like, knowing that Mueller and all these people are, like, constantly asking about me, and they're now talking to someone like Corsi, who could just make up anything at this point.
[03:08:29.796 --> 03:08:30.116]  All right.
[03:08:31.698 --> 03:08:32.659]  I'm married to Vladimir Putin.
[03:08:32.719 --> 03:08:39.147]  I'm a transgender woman into a man, but I haven't had the surgery yet, and the beard's fake, and Putin's my lover.
[03:08:39.447 --> 03:08:39.667]  I admit it.
[03:08:39.787 --> 03:08:40.788]  Of course he has the evidence.
[03:08:40.828 --> 03:08:41.729]  Of course he was involved.
[03:08:43.131 --> 03:08:43.832]  Trump was involved.
[03:08:43.852 --> 03:08:44.853]  They both urinated on me.
[03:08:45.454 --> 03:08:46.094]  Mueller was there.
[03:08:46.134 --> 03:08:46.895]  He peed on me, too.
[03:08:48.617 --> 03:08:49.578]  We were on the Lita Express.
[03:08:51.203 --> 03:08:54.545]  If you believe that, then you believe that Hillary Clinton won in 2016.
[03:08:54.905 --> 03:08:56.086]  I'm sorry.
[03:08:56.106 --> 03:08:56.687]  It's a joke.
[03:08:56.747 --> 03:08:57.147]  It's bad.
[03:08:57.407 --> 03:08:59.749]  But, I mean, there's the photo!
[03:09:00.649 --> 03:09:01.930]  I'm on a horse with my shirt off.
[03:09:02.430 --> 03:09:04.112]  Putin's on a horse with his shirt off.
[03:09:05.653 --> 03:09:11.637]  And yes, I transitioned from being a woman to a man, but still, sometimes I go back the other way when my little pootie-poot's involved.
[03:09:12.977 --> 03:09:14.999]  That's Bush's nickname for him, my little poopie-poop.
[03:09:16.195 --> 03:09:19.318]  In fact, well, Bush was involved, George W. was involved too.
[03:09:20.019 --> 03:09:21.300]  I've dated George W. Bush, okay?
[03:09:21.780 --> 03:09:22.661]  It's out there, it's all true.
[03:09:23.182 --> 03:09:24.763]  Alright, I'm gonna stop being sarcastic.
[03:09:24.803 --> 03:09:26.365]  This is what happens when I get stressed out.
[03:09:27.066 --> 03:09:27.726]  And I get angry.
[03:09:29.088 --> 03:09:30.769]  Because I'm getting really tired of this.
[03:09:30.789 --> 03:09:32.611]  And I'm sick of it.
[03:09:33.452 --> 03:09:35.454]  And I'm sick of people lying constantly.
[03:09:37.062 --> 03:09:39.544]  And so the only way I can deal with it is just to start making jokes about it.
[03:09:40.565 --> 03:09:45.209]  Jack Dorsey is being investigated for criminally lying under oath.
[03:09:45.269 --> 03:09:46.089]  It's being reported.
[03:09:46.109 --> 03:09:47.691]  Infowars.com, Jamie White.
[03:09:48.231 --> 03:09:52.995]  And it links through to the announcements that have been put out by Congress.
[03:09:54.636 --> 03:09:56.198]  That's huge news.
[03:09:57.679 --> 03:09:59.621]  Paul Watson has a big raft of things to cover.
[03:09:59.661 --> 03:10:00.842]  Someone tried to hand the baton to him.
[03:10:02.225 --> 03:10:08.292]  Please remember, InfoWars is a national treasure because of our guests, because of you, the best activist audience out there that are on the front lines.
[03:10:09.033 --> 03:10:11.436]  And so please remember, you're going to do Christmas shopping.
[03:10:11.917 --> 03:10:14.680]  Why would you want to battle the lines at malls and pay overpriced stuff?
[03:10:15.060 --> 03:10:18.144]  Why would you want to buy a bunch of Chinese slave goods at, you know, Target or wherever?
[03:10:18.604 --> 03:10:22.149]  Why would you want to go to Amazon that is openly working with the globalists?
[03:10:23.959 --> 03:10:31.702]  InfoWarsTore.com for great t-shirts, great books, great films, great high-quality storable food, incredible supplements, the very best air and water filtration.
[03:10:32.702 --> 03:10:34.123]  And we've got the biggest sales.
[03:10:34.143 --> 03:10:35.243]  We were like, oh, you've been saying that for months.
[03:10:35.263 --> 03:10:40.565]  Yes, each sale has escalated as I attempt to sell out all stock by the end of the year so I don't have to pay taxes on it.
[03:10:41.966 --> 03:10:45.507]  Because I'm not even sure we'll be able to have a shopping cart.
[03:10:45.527 --> 03:10:47.008]  We'll be here for a long time.
[03:10:47.308 --> 03:10:50.669]  Even if they cut the money off, we could operate for a while, three months, six months, whatever.
[03:10:52.708 --> 03:10:54.610]  The point is they're trying to shut us down everywhere.
[03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:56.112]  They're trying to take our payment processors.
[03:10:57.133 --> 03:11:04.480]  They've got political laze teams following me around, creating some type of map to set me up or something.
[03:11:04.500 --> 03:11:05.481]  I'm not sure, but whatever.
[03:11:07.463 --> 03:11:09.245]  Just you need these products, and they're great.
[03:11:09.345 --> 03:11:10.867]  And you want an InfoWars t-shirt.
[03:11:10.887 --> 03:11:11.968]  You want a piece of history.
[03:11:11.988 --> 03:11:12.649]  50% off.
[03:11:14.346 --> 03:11:14.566]  All right.
[03:11:33.169 --> 03:11:33.930]  Here's another example.
[03:11:34.170 --> 03:11:35.631]  You probably just want to buy something in Alibaba.
[03:11:35.651 --> 03:11:37.492]  You don't want to buy it in a store.com.
[03:11:38.432 --> 03:11:43.615]  Jack Ma, China's richest man, is a Communist Party member, they've announced, as if we didn't need to know that.
[03:11:44.376 --> 03:11:47.258]  And of course, the inner party members are pretty much all billionaires.
[03:11:48.078 --> 03:11:52.341]  And you're a slave, you have no rights, and then he's a billionaire, the guy that owns Alibaba.
[03:11:53.061 --> 03:11:54.062]  So I just thought I'd add that.
[03:11:54.142 --> 03:11:57.444]  Also, a woman describes torture, beatings in Chinese detention camp.
[03:11:57.884 --> 03:11:59.826]  But you won't hear a word out of all the left.
[03:11:59.846 --> 03:12:04.870]  They'll talk about how bad I am all day, but not about, you know, all the horrible things or how they funded the Arab Spring or the rest of it.
[03:12:04.890 --> 03:12:07.312]  So, Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[03:12:07.892 --> 03:12:08.473]  Paul, thank you.
[03:12:08.493 --> 03:12:08.713]  Go ahead.
[03:12:10.354 --> 03:12:10.955]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:12:10.995 --> 03:12:13.417]  Yeah, there's a big story up on Infowars.com right now.
[03:12:14.258 --> 03:12:20.043]  Headlined, Yale study finds that white liberals dumbed down their vocabulary when speaking to black people.
[03:12:20.583 --> 03:12:23.986]  Again, this is a research study out of Yale University.
[03:12:24.736 --> 03:12:47.783]  Basically, they did a study, both of political campaign speeches by Democrats and Republicans and the general public, found that when white liberals or white Democrats are speaking to black people, whether it be a campaign crowd or one-on-one in these tests, they reduce their use of so-called competence words, which mean words that describe their own skills.
[03:12:48.425 --> 03:12:57.028]  So basically, that's another way of saying they try to identify with minorities and with black people by pretending to be dumb.
[03:12:57.948 --> 03:13:10.172]  Again, we go back to this time and time again, the bigotry of low expectations when the mask slips, the racism, the implicit racism becomes more overt within white leftists.
[03:13:11.053 --> 03:13:12.013]  A New Yale study
[03:13:12.981 --> 03:13:19.783]  It was found that white liberals deliberately dumbed down their vocabulary when speaking to black people in comparison to conservatives who don't.
[03:13:20.303 --> 03:13:32.826]  They did studies, they tested their political beliefs, then they ran them through a one-on-one conversation with a minority, with a black person, and found that conservatives do not dumb down their vocabulary to identify with minorities.
[03:13:33.146 --> 03:13:34.166]  White liberals do.
[03:13:34.846 --> 03:13:41.788]  According to the study, quote, white liberals tend to downplay their own verbal competence in exchanges with racial minorities.
[03:13:42.509 --> 03:13:49.004]  And they went on to describe this as surprising, and they said it could be seen as patronising.
[03:13:49.850 --> 03:13:58.316]  They tried to make excuses for the white liberals and saying, oh, they were just trying to overcompensate and be friendly and try to identify with black people.
[03:13:58.656 --> 03:14:00.277]  No, we've seen this time and time again.
[03:14:00.297 --> 03:14:11.906]  Well, Paul, I mean, I've got, in the past, liberal friends or even some family that's kind of liberal, and when they get around a Hispanic person, it doesn't matter if they're a doctor or whatever, they're like, hello, do you want taco?
[03:14:12.486 --> 03:14:17.370]  And that's how Hillary, remember in California with Hispanics, like, and I am Latino.
[03:14:17.970 --> 03:14:27.955]  And whenever Obama will talk about something in Spanish, he'll like over-emphasize words and everyone else does this weird over-emphasize patronizing.
[03:14:27.995 --> 03:14:29.536]  And then Democrats are very famous.
[03:14:29.576 --> 03:14:35.559]  Hillary, when she's speaking to rural areas or southern areas or Kentucky, she goes, how you doing there?
[03:14:35.579 --> 03:14:40.322]  I had some possum pie this morning with granny over at the cement pond.
[03:14:40.502 --> 03:14:42.303]  Well, hear it from her yourself.
[03:14:42.343 --> 03:14:42.903]  Here it is.
[03:14:43.764 --> 03:14:45.865]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[03:14:48.149 --> 03:14:50.051]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:50.412 --> 03:14:51.433]  Welcome to Chair Chats.
[03:14:51.533 --> 03:14:52.775]  Jamie, I'm delighted to be here.
[03:14:53.055 --> 03:14:57.681]  You know, I love sitting here and rocking, so thanks for giving me the chance to do that.
[03:14:59.892 --> 03:15:00.953]  And there's a lot more of that.
[03:15:01.033 --> 03:15:01.833]  Paul, go ahead and take over.
[03:15:01.853 --> 03:15:07.916]  I just had to pop back in because studies show Democrats are many more times likely to steal, many more times likely to virtue-signal and be fake.
[03:15:08.797 --> 03:15:15.820]  How many times I've been out at demonstrations or whatever and the white leftists will see some black people show up and they'll go all of a sudden like, hold on one moment, racist.
[03:15:16.241 --> 03:15:17.441]  Yo, bro, what's up?
[03:15:17.501 --> 03:15:19.462]  Let's get down, baby!
[03:15:19.702 --> 03:15:21.924]  And then white people are like, what are you talking to me like that for?
[03:15:22.284 --> 03:15:27.106]  So yes, what they are is they're fake, Paul, and conservatives are authentic and real.
[03:15:27.326 --> 03:15:27.947]  When I get around
[03:15:28.467 --> 03:15:31.108]  Black people, I don't start going, hey, what's up, brother?
[03:15:31.128 --> 03:15:32.348]  Let's get down today, man.
[03:15:32.368 --> 03:15:33.308]  Let's go get some bitches.
[03:15:33.688 --> 03:15:35.089]  Because most black people don't talk like that.
[03:15:35.149 --> 03:15:37.069]  But again, that's the whole MTV culture.
[03:15:37.709 --> 03:15:42.691]  But when Hillary gets around a southern area like Alabama, she's like, how you doing there, boy?
[03:15:42.711 --> 03:15:46.311]  I love the Rebel flag.
[03:15:46.551 --> 03:15:47.632]  Here it is.
[03:15:47.712 --> 03:15:53.393]  In fact, when she first ran for president, their symbol in the South was the Rebel battle flag.
[03:15:54.693 --> 03:15:56.654]  We'll be back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:16:02.725 --> 03:16:12.972]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[03:16:13.352 --> 03:16:25.401]  And as we prepare to close out 2018, isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[03:16:26.421 --> 03:16:31.684]  Or do you say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics and he's still a man?
[03:16:31.924 --> 03:16:33.085]  Well, that's dead naming.
[03:16:33.385 --> 03:16:41.409]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[03:16:41.789 --> 03:16:44.971]  Then they say it's racist to say, no, that it's okay to be white.
[03:16:45.311 --> 03:16:48.093]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation or borders.
[03:16:48.533 --> 03:16:51.215]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told is evil.
[03:16:51.655 --> 03:16:55.217]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[03:16:56.141 --> 03:16:58.082]  World War III was the Cold War.
[03:16:59.463 --> 03:17:01.144]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[03:17:01.564 --> 03:17:19.173]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others, with the America-hating Hollywood crowd, literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left.
[03:17:20.911 --> 03:17:24.252]  The globalists are threatened by first world nations.
[03:17:24.272 --> 03:17:25.552]  They're threatened by the middle class.
[03:17:25.592 --> 03:17:29.913]  They're threatened by the uppity-ness of free market capitalism.
[03:17:30.473 --> 03:17:34.513]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[03:17:35.273 --> 03:17:36.874]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[03:17:37.334 --> 03:17:40.054]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[03:17:41.114 --> 03:17:42.475]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[03:17:42.535 --> 03:17:46.755]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[03:17:47.296 --> 03:17:50.056]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[03:17:51.544 --> 03:17:57.668]  But the globalists are counter-striking against independent patriot nationalist media like InfoWars.
[03:17:57.688 --> 03:18:07.635]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective, thanks to your support, you have been the most effective at exposing what's really happening.
[03:18:08.235 --> 03:18:12.538]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[03:18:13.018 --> 03:18:16.501]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[03:18:17.121 --> 03:18:21.124]  And I wanted just to remind you that InfoWars isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[03:18:22.325 --> 03:18:23.445]  And without you, we won't be here.
[03:18:24.046 --> 03:18:28.048]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[03:18:29.249 --> 03:18:31.591]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:32.071 --> 03:18:40.837]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[03:18:40.917 --> 03:18:43.659]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment and
[03:18:44.039 --> 03:18:44.740]  We're good to go.
[03:19:10.481 --> 03:19:27.149]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding Infowars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[03:19:27.629 --> 03:19:38.874]  And you are provisioning and funding, not just the second American revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[03:19:39.674 --> 03:19:40.775]  Forced sterilization.
[03:19:41.135 --> 03:19:42.436]  Children being sterilized.
[03:19:42.916 --> 03:19:45.878]  This is pure, total, absolute evil.
[03:19:45.998 --> 03:19:49.741]  And Infowars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[03:19:50.041 --> 03:19:52.362]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny.
[03:19:52.622 --> 03:19:54.103]  And we will fight until the end.
[03:19:54.544 --> 03:19:56.825]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[03:19:56.885 --> 03:19:59.006]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[03:19:59.407 --> 03:20:00.567]  And thank you all for your support.
[03:20:00.768 --> 03:20:01.208]  God bless you.
[03:20:06.698 --> 03:20:19.709]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.809 --> 03:20:26.414]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:26.875 --> 03:20:30.598]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:32.861 --> 03:20:56.612]  We are back and we are talking about how leftists modify their behavior, modify their speech, modify their interactions with minorities, with black people when in a one-on-one situation and also during campaign speeches as you heard there before the break Hillary Clinton completely changing her accent depending on the crowd to ridiculous levels because there's a new Yale study out today
[03:20:57.560 --> 03:20:58.900]  Which is up on Infowars.com.
[03:20:58.920 --> 03:21:03.502]  Headline, Yale study finds white liberals dumbed down their vocabulary when speaking to black people.
[03:21:04.182 --> 03:21:08.704]  That wasn't the headline of the study, obviously, but this is the nuts and bolts of it.
[03:21:08.784 --> 03:21:13.706]  In the study, they claim, oh, they're just trying to overcompensate because they're do-gooders.
[03:21:13.746 --> 03:21:15.126]  They're just trying to be friendly.
[03:21:15.526 --> 03:21:22.229]  No, they're being patronizing and condescending because they are actually implicitly racist in a lot of situations.
[03:21:23.029 --> 03:21:23.369]  In fact,
[03:21:24.509 --> 03:21:28.711]  I saw this in the flesh the other day, running through the park near where I live.
[03:21:29.291 --> 03:21:32.693]  And there was this Muslim woman with the full veil, basically the full veil.
[03:21:33.914 --> 03:21:34.834]  God only knows why.
[03:21:34.894 --> 03:21:35.494]  She was running.
[03:21:35.514 --> 03:21:38.216]  I say running, she was more ambling along.
[03:21:38.276 --> 03:21:39.976]  She was fat, let's just put it that way.
[03:21:40.057 --> 03:21:40.977]  She was very fat.
[03:21:41.317 --> 03:21:43.398]  She had this full-on black veil.
[03:21:44.419 --> 03:21:45.999]  And you know, whatever, she's doing exercise.
[03:21:46.159 --> 03:21:47.120]  I'm running up behind.
[03:21:47.580 --> 03:21:53.423]  And then this white leftist, obviously a leftist given the way she spoke to her, was coming up behind her on a bike.
[03:21:54.648 --> 03:21:55.569]  Total stranger.
[03:21:55.609 --> 03:21:57.029]  She didn't know this woman from anyone.
[03:21:57.530 --> 03:22:04.893]  And just stopped this Muslim woman and got in her face politely, but then raised her voice and she was like, Oh, good for you.
[03:22:05.113 --> 03:22:05.874]  Good for you.
[03:22:06.234 --> 03:22:07.114]  That's really good.
[03:22:07.154 --> 03:22:08.795]  You should continue exercising.
[03:22:08.835 --> 03:22:09.696]  That's really good.
[03:22:10.116 --> 03:22:11.717]  And you can tell she is being condescending.
[03:22:12.157 --> 03:22:15.299]  And this Muslim woman just responded in like a South London accent.
[03:22:15.339 --> 03:22:17.940]  She looked a bit perplexed and a little bit terrified.
[03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:21.442]  And it was virtue signaling in real life.
[03:22:22.002 --> 03:22:23.543]  And that's what we're talking about here.
[03:22:24.292 --> 03:22:32.396]  White leftists talking down, dumbing down their language when they're around minorities, people of colour, whatever you want to call it.
[03:22:32.736 --> 03:22:35.317]  And this is proven in this Yale study.
[03:22:35.597 --> 03:22:38.039]  They compared it to conservatives and they don't do it.
[03:22:39.159 --> 03:22:43.781]  The bigoted, mean, nasty deplorables, they don't do the same thing.
[03:22:44.282 --> 03:22:45.342]  This is from the study.
[03:22:45.402 --> 03:22:53.446]  Quote, they designed a series of experiments in which white participants were asked to respond to a hypothetical or presumed real interaction partner.
[03:22:53.996 --> 03:22:58.317]  For half of these participants, their partner was given a stereotypically white name, such as Emily.
[03:22:59.397 --> 03:23:03.339]  And for the other half, their partner was given a stereotypically black name, such as Lakeisha.
[03:23:03.879 --> 03:23:07.580]  Participants were asked to select from a list of words for an email to their partner.
[03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:10.700]  For some studies, this email was for a work-related task.
[03:23:10.721 --> 03:23:13.181]  For others, this email was simply to introduce themselves.
[03:23:13.681 --> 03:23:16.962]  Each word had been previously scored on how warm, i.e.
[03:23:17.082 --> 03:23:18.583]  friendly, or competent, i.e.
[03:23:18.743 --> 03:23:19.823]  intelligent, it appears.
[03:23:20.396 --> 03:23:23.559]  The word sad, for example, scored low for both warmth and competence.
[03:23:23.920 --> 03:23:27.103]  Melancholy, on the other hand, scored high for competence and low on warmth.
[03:23:27.683 --> 03:23:28.324]  So they found...
[03:23:29.577 --> 03:23:30.678]  This is straight from the study.
[03:23:51.241 --> 03:23:52.802]  Because they're actually racist.
[03:23:53.282 --> 03:23:59.444]  No significant differences were seen in the word selection of conservatives based on the presumed race of their partner.
[03:23:59.945 --> 03:24:02.486]  So conservatives didn't dumb down their vocabulary.
[03:24:03.446 --> 03:24:11.109]  A more crude interpretation, this is what I wrote, would be that the white liberal is essentially saying, I'm a dumbass just like you, we'll get along fine.
[03:24:11.609 --> 03:24:18.452]  So they're trying to dumb down their behavior, modify their vocabulary, because they think that will make them identify better with this minority.
[03:24:19.102 --> 03:24:28.449]  The researchers concluded that the propensity for white liberals to simplify and adapt their vocabulary when talking to minorities was, quote, kind of an unpleasant surprise.
[03:24:29.089 --> 03:24:34.393]  It's not a surprise, but they thought it was a surprise and, quote, could be seen as patronizing.
[03:24:34.833 --> 03:24:43.219]  So they literally amend their vocabulary, the words they use, and it just makes them come across as more patronizing, more condescending.
[03:24:44.133 --> 03:24:55.639]  The study emphasises how white leftists, while white leftists are keen to virtue signal about how much they respect people of colour, when it comes to judging their intelligence, the opposite is true.
[03:24:56.460 --> 03:25:05.665]  And I compare it to a different article and study which we featured before, headline, poorer conservatives more generous than wealthy liberals.
[03:25:05.685 --> 03:25:11.288]  So again, the liberal will virtue signal all day about how loving, how inclusive,
[03:25:12.139 --> 03:25:17.448]  How embracing of diversity they really are when it comes to actually talking to a person of color.
[03:25:18.570 --> 03:25:20.292]  They turn into a different person.
[03:25:20.453 --> 03:25:21.795]  They dumb themselves down.
[03:25:22.296 --> 03:25:24.900]  Similar situation in Britain.
[03:25:26.138 --> 03:25:39.370]  Again, they demonise white working-class people as deplorables, as bigots, as racists, when those white working-class people, because they're poorer, are more likely to interact with black people, with Muslims, on a day-to-day basis.
[03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:49.639]  It's the white middle-class leftist that never interacts with any of those people unless they're hiring them to keep their house clean, or wash their car, or do their yard work, or whatever.
[03:25:50.060 --> 03:25:52.602]  And when they do so, again, they talk down to them.
[03:25:53.757 --> 03:25:56.339]  But again, poorer Conservatives more generous than wealthy Liberals.
[03:25:56.359 --> 03:25:57.260]  This is another study.
[03:25:58.221 --> 03:26:10.672]  Less well-off families from red states donate a relatively higher and growing proportion of their money to charity, while those at the top have been giving a smaller share as their income has increased.
[03:26:10.912 --> 03:26:13.875]  So even as they got more wealthy, they gave less money to charity.
[03:26:14.616 --> 03:26:20.101]  Of course, you go on their Twitter page and every other tweet is retweeting charities and promoting
[03:26:20.788 --> 03:26:22.409]  You know, do gooder causes.
[03:26:22.490 --> 03:26:24.211]  Do they actually give to those charities?
[03:26:24.331 --> 03:26:24.551]  No.
[03:26:24.832 --> 03:26:26.513]  The studies say they don't.
[03:26:26.893 --> 03:26:28.435]  So it's all about projecting.
[03:26:28.795 --> 03:26:29.796]  Virtue signalling.
[03:26:30.196 --> 03:26:34.980]  How much of a good person they are when it actually boils down to handing over the cash.
[03:26:35.981 --> 03:26:36.862]  It's non-existent.
[03:26:37.382 --> 03:26:40.785]  While poorer Conservatives do tend to give more to charity.
[03:26:41.306 --> 03:26:43.408]  Very interesting study.
[03:26:43.728 --> 03:26:48.352]  And you can compare this to what's happening in Portland over the past few days.
[03:26:49.972 --> 03:26:56.135]  Headline, Portland protesters urge United States to accept Central American refugees waiting at the border.
[03:26:56.575 --> 03:26:58.916]  So big protests in Portland this week.
[03:26:58.996 --> 03:27:01.877]  The progressive trendies just love refugees.
[03:27:02.217 --> 03:27:17.024]  They love migrants, except if you're migrating from California, and we've got a clip about this which we can play right now, in which case they hate your guts and literally all over Portland they stick up stickers with the state of California crossed out.
[03:27:17.771 --> 03:27:22.594]  They hate migrants if they're migrating from within America, but again, they love the refugees.
[03:27:22.634 --> 03:27:23.815]  Let's go to this clip right now.
[03:27:24.735 --> 03:27:30.999]  Portland couple woke up to find hateful graffiti outside their home, telling them to move back to California.
[03:27:31.319 --> 03:27:33.881]  The homeowners had just moved in a few months ago.
[03:27:34.241 --> 03:27:38.624]  KGW's Kyle Iboshi is live in Northeast Portland's Rose City neighborhood with the details.
[03:27:38.644 --> 03:27:38.924]  Kyle.
[03:27:41.374 --> 03:27:50.060]  Christine, those homeowners are trying to clean up the ugly vandalism you can see behind us with some fresh paint but it doesn't help to erase the hateful messages they encountered this morning.
[03:27:50.120 --> 03:27:55.163]  The couple woke up to find their car tagged with graffiti which read, go back to California and get out of PDX.
[03:27:55.564 --> 03:27:58.886]  Their Rose City home was also spray-painted with hateful messages.
[03:27:59.326 --> 03:28:01.548]  The couple moved into the home only a few months ago.
[03:28:01.568 --> 03:28:04.730]  Neighbors say they've done a wonderful job fixing the place up.
[03:28:06.151 --> 03:28:09.273]  Breaks my heart because these people are young and they're new to the city and
[03:28:13.143 --> 03:28:18.645]  They put so much work into this place and then to have someone come along and do something like this is obscene.
[03:28:18.665 --> 03:28:30.510]  I had a chance to speak with the homeowners just a few moments ago and they think this vandalism may be related to a road rage incident that occurred yesterday.
[03:28:30.530 --> 03:28:39.134]  They said there was an incident with another driver and that driver allegedly said go back to California similar to the graffiti that was painted on their car and their home.
[03:28:40.313 --> 03:28:46.438]  So again, leftists in Portland, they're all about welcoming migrants and refugees, except migrants from California, which they hate.
[03:28:46.478 --> 03:28:54.526]  Again, it's about saying one thing, projecting one image, but then when it comes down to it, following through on a completely different schedule.
[03:28:55.066 --> 03:28:56.247]  We'll be back in the next segment.
[03:28:56.267 --> 03:28:57.268]  This is the Alex Jones Show!
[03:28:57.288 --> 03:28:58.869]  LiveinfoWars.com.
[03:28:58.889 --> 03:28:59.390]  Don't go away.
[03:29:02.757 --> 03:29:08.502]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[03:29:08.782 --> 03:29:12.805]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[03:29:13.266 --> 03:29:15.468]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[03:29:15.488 --> 03:29:17.609]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[03:29:17.970 --> 03:29:19.971]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[03:29:20.492 --> 03:29:20.732]  Boom!
[03:29:21.032 --> 03:29:23.274]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[03:29:23.614 --> 03:29:25.196]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[03:29:25.236 --> 03:29:27.077]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[03:29:27.117 --> 03:29:28.258]  You still have a shopfront.
[03:29:28.438 --> 03:29:29.239]  And then what do we see?
[03:29:29.519 --> 03:29:30.260]  Washington Post.
[03:29:30.800 --> 03:29:33.942]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%.
[03:29:35.303 --> 03:29:38.425]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[03:29:38.445 --> 03:29:41.267]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[03:29:41.587 --> 03:29:46.991]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:47.311 --> 03:29:54.296]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[03:29:54.636 --> 03:29:58.038]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships like CNN is.
[03:29:58.299 --> 03:30:00.520]  We're only funded by you by getting the products
[03:30:00.540 --> 03:30:00.946]  We're good.
[03:30:08.659 --> 03:30:12.860]  The Border Patrol warned Texans about militias stopping migrant caravans.
[03:30:13.080 --> 03:30:16.721]  We've got way more than just the 5,000 troops that Trump talked about.
[03:30:16.781 --> 03:30:20.742]  We've got video that's on DrudgeReport.com of army tanks being sent down there.
[03:30:20.822 --> 03:30:23.163]  Abrams tanks, command vehicles, all of it.
[03:30:23.243 --> 03:30:25.164]  So I think Trump's got this handled.
[03:30:25.204 --> 03:30:32.005]  People have a right to go down there, but I'm just saying I smell a big fat chance for some leftist group to shoot some, you know, kids or something.
[03:30:32.125 --> 03:30:35.987]  Because, you know, nobody's really shot any migrant kids other than Mexican coyotes.
[03:30:36.307 --> 03:30:37.747]  I really am concerned, Gavin McGinnis.
[03:30:37.867 --> 03:30:42.809]  Yeah, I've even been talking to liberals here in New York City, and they don't seem to like this.
[03:30:42.969 --> 03:30:59.657]  They smell a rat, and it just seems very curious that thousands of people spontaneously rent some 18-wheelers together, I guess they all pool their money, and they drive, and then walk for the cameras, and then drive, and then walk for the cameras, on their way to Mexico.
[03:30:59.737 --> 03:31:04.720]  I mean, even the left is saying, this really looks like it's for optics, and if it is,
[03:31:05.360 --> 03:31:12.806]  Just for optics, that is brutally sinister and it shows how, I don't know, how evil some of these people on the left can be.
[03:31:12.826 --> 03:31:21.652]  Because are you trying to set up a scenario where hundreds of migrants are pushing the fences and they get crushed and maybe there's a photo of a dead kid or something?
[03:31:21.752 --> 03:31:27.316]  Or a military guy shooting at people who are trying to, you know, mob him or something?
[03:31:27.356 --> 03:31:32.820]  Are you trying to get some picture to change the election and happily sacrificing hundreds of people?
[03:31:33.570 --> 03:31:35.892]  Well, I mean, you're gonna put Satan out of work.
[03:31:36.092 --> 03:31:39.634]  You know what this reminds me of is Fast and Furious, which isn't controversial.
[03:31:39.674 --> 03:31:49.821]  Everyone knows that, what was it, Eric Holder and Obama were caught sending guns down to Mexico so they could make guns look bad, get them in the hands of cartels, and they'll go, look at all these AKs, they killed tons of people.
[03:31:49.901 --> 03:31:52.303]  I mean, no matter how bad the right gets,
[03:31:52.583 --> 03:31:58.205]  You never hear about them wanting to use human beings as fodder, where they're happily risking lives for optics.
[03:31:58.405 --> 03:32:00.566]  I mean, this is Stalin in a nutshell.
[03:32:00.746 --> 03:32:03.446]  This is his mass starvations and mass murder.
[03:32:03.526 --> 03:32:04.967]  This is the way communists think.
[03:32:05.007 --> 03:32:06.387]  They don't think about human beings.
[03:32:06.427 --> 03:32:08.948]  They see humans as just sort of like ephemera.
[03:32:09.088 --> 03:32:11.689]  Just a big pile of wasps they can send somewhere.
[03:32:12.149 --> 03:32:14.090]  Or a dam they can blow and have it just flood.
[03:32:15.050 --> 03:32:15.991]  And the UN admits that.
[03:32:16.031 --> 03:32:25.601]  They say they want to destroy borders, collapse the evil capitalist system, so they'll accept the socialist utopia with rich people like Soros and the Chai Khans tax-exempt living in palaces.
[03:32:25.781 --> 03:32:27.062]  Dismantle capitalism.
[03:32:27.102 --> 03:32:32.868]  You know, when I was a young man in the 80s, that was what the crazy, radical nuts said, and it was kind of cool.
[03:32:32.968 --> 03:32:34.790]  Like, oh, this guy's a communist.
[03:32:34.830 --> 03:32:35.971]  That's kind of a freaky thing.
[03:32:36.671 --> 03:32:38.071]  Um, now it's mainstream.
[03:32:38.131 --> 03:32:43.013]  I think something like more than 50% of people in the DNC would prefer socialism.
[03:32:43.193 --> 03:32:46.893]  It's 50 plus percent of millennials want communism or socialism.
[03:32:46.993 --> 03:32:48.974]  And they always use Northern Europe as an example.
[03:32:49.234 --> 03:32:51.995]  Northern Europe made its money when it was free market.
[03:32:52.095 --> 03:32:55.055]  It is now literally spending its parents money.
[03:32:55.095 --> 03:32:55.935]  It's going bankrupt.
[03:32:56.456 --> 03:32:57.396]  Fully plummeting.
[03:33:06.147 --> 03:33:10.789]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.950 --> 03:33:23.733]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.953 --> 03:33:27.654]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:29.699 --> 03:33:37.704]  We're live, and we are going to talk about Sweden, my favourite country, which is often the butt of jokes, and for very good reason.
[03:33:37.724 --> 03:33:38.484]  And here's another one.
[03:33:38.925 --> 03:33:42.267]  Swedish headmaster wears dress to school to break norms.
[03:33:43.647 --> 03:33:52.113]  Stunning and brave, a headmaster in Sweden wears a dress and nail varnish to school in order to break norms and set an example for students.
[03:33:52.773 --> 03:33:56.375]  I want to show the students that it's actually OK for a guy to wear a dress if he wants to.
[03:33:58.607 --> 03:34:01.931]  Chances are that this isn't in a migrant-heavy area in Sweden.
[03:34:01.951 --> 03:34:08.498]  Of course, in Germany, they've had a massive problem with bullying of both students and teachers in those areas.
[03:34:08.558 --> 03:34:11.321]  In fact, one case which springs to mind is when
[03:34:12.248 --> 03:34:21.639]  A blonde German girl went to school without a hijab in this migrant-heavy school in Germany and she was bullied, she was beaten up, she was victimised basically.
[03:34:22.160 --> 03:34:26.565]  The parents went to the teacher in this school in Germany and said, what are you going to do about this?
[03:34:26.605 --> 03:34:27.406]  She's getting bullied.
[03:34:27.886 --> 03:34:31.811]  The answer from the headmaster was, put her in a hijab!
[03:34:32.788 --> 03:34:36.249]  We're talking about a blonde, Christian, German girl.
[03:34:36.549 --> 03:34:40.590]  The answer to being bullied and beaten up by Muslim migrants is apparently to put her in a hijab.
[03:34:40.970 --> 03:34:43.331]  And maybe this Swedish headmaster would agree.
[03:34:44.591 --> 03:34:47.892]  He says, I think it's important to show the students you can look however you want.
[03:34:48.112 --> 03:34:51.313]  He says, it's nothing I do every day, but I want to show that it's possible to break norms.
[03:34:51.693 --> 03:34:55.514]  So basically he's been going to school in a dress and nail varnish for the past three years.
[03:34:56.294 --> 03:34:56.714]  Meanwhile,
[03:34:57.822 --> 03:35:03.706]  A Me Too school lesson has been introduced for 15-year-olds in Sweden in order to take a stand against macho culture.
[03:35:04.147 --> 03:35:12.033]  And Sweden itself is taking a stand against macho culture by having men sterilize themselves.
[03:35:12.933 --> 03:35:17.016]  Swedish men seeking voluntary vasectomies has risen by 70%, that's 7-0%, from 1,400 men in 2013 to 2,417 in 2017.
[03:35:24.013 --> 03:35:29.198]  In cities like Stockholm, the number of men sterilizing themselves has doubled over the last five years.
[03:35:29.598 --> 03:35:31.200]  Meanwhile, the gang rapes are on the rise.
[03:35:31.220 --> 03:35:31.840]  I wonder why?
[03:35:32.581 --> 03:35:37.145]  Sweden's got a 1.78 birth rate, well below the replacement rate of 2.2 children.
[03:35:37.966 --> 03:35:41.889]  This compares to over two children for women from migrant backgrounds.
[03:35:43.231 --> 03:35:44.672]  So that's going on in Sweden.
[03:35:45.911 --> 03:35:58.737]  Where they literally have microphones in the streets to catch the screams of women being raped but they won't build police stations in these areas because they get firebombed and grenade attacked because diversity is our strength.
[03:35:59.958 --> 03:36:07.161]  Over in the UK, headline out of Breitbart, UK lawmakers call for Islamophobia to be officially classed as racism.
[03:36:07.853 --> 03:36:17.676]  This is a report from a group of British parliamentarians who have demanded that Islamophobia be officially classed as a form of racism in the UK, claiming the country is deeply prejudiced and unfair towards Muslims.
[03:36:17.976 --> 03:36:24.797]  Because apparently, we've got this massive explosion of hate crime in the UK, up 17% recently.
[03:36:25.318 --> 03:36:26.418]  Now if you actually look...
[03:36:27.082 --> 03:36:35.927]  But what is being reported and investigated by thousands of police officers as to what is a hate crime, it makes for very interesting reading.
[03:36:36.428 --> 03:36:42.111]  Now, bear in mind that we've got stabbings at all-time highs, acid attacks at all-time highs.
[03:36:42.491 --> 03:36:45.753]  In some months, London is more dangerous than New York per capita.
[03:36:46.573 --> 03:36:54.078]  But no, we've devoted thousands and thousands of police officers and resources to tackling mean tweets and mean comments on the street.
[03:36:55.191 --> 03:36:59.133]  These were the hate crimes that were reported and investigated in the UK recently.
[03:37:00.114 --> 03:37:02.736]  A dog pooping outside someone's house.
[03:37:03.116 --> 03:37:11.241]  That's right, a dog was investigated for a racist hate crime because it pooped outside someone's house who was non-white.
[03:37:11.401 --> 03:37:13.703]  That's a legitimate news story, that's not the onion.
[03:37:14.303 --> 03:37:15.804]  A dog barking at someone.
[03:37:15.844 --> 03:37:19.866]  That was reported and investigated as a potential racist hate crime.
[03:37:20.247 --> 03:37:20.727]  Because again,
[03:37:21.320 --> 03:37:25.562]  They have to investigate it if the victim perceives that it's a hate crime.
[03:37:26.582 --> 03:37:27.663]  So it's up to the victim.
[03:37:27.703 --> 03:37:29.984]  If they perceive it as a hate crime, they call the police.
[03:37:30.024 --> 03:37:33.465]  The police are duty bound to investigate it.
[03:37:33.865 --> 03:37:37.947]  There's no objective standard for what constitutes a hate crime.
[03:37:38.027 --> 03:37:41.328]  If the victim says it's a hate crime, it's a hate crime, or at least potentially.
[03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:43.849]  A bus driver's racist.
[03:37:43.909 --> 03:37:46.230]  Look, a bus driver looked at someone in the wrong way.
[03:37:46.330 --> 03:37:47.071]  They got offended.
[03:37:47.251 --> 03:37:48.051]  That's a hate crime.
[03:37:48.715 --> 03:37:52.558]  A dispute over a parking spot, that was turned into a potential hate crime.
[03:37:53.118 --> 03:37:57.261]  A traffic accident where the victim was non-white, that was reported as a hate crime.
[03:37:58.442 --> 03:38:04.666]  And someone losing a tennis match because they said the umpire was racist.
[03:38:05.146 --> 03:38:16.034]  So is it any surprise that hate crime is up 17% and more in the UK recently if such ridiculous instances are being reported and investigated as hate crimes?
[03:38:16.966 --> 03:38:23.389]  But this new parliamentary report blames prevalent Islamophobia for divisions, hate crimes and even terror attacks.
[03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:23.809]  That's right.
[03:38:24.129 --> 03:38:37.695]  Being mean to Muslims causes terror attacks, which ironically is in and of itself Islamophobic, because you're saying that Muslims can't handle their feelings being hurt, saying that they will react with violence if you hurt their feelings or offend them.
[03:38:38.615 --> 03:38:40.796]  Again, the bigotry of low expectations.
[03:38:40.836 --> 03:38:45.238]  That in itself is Islamophobic, but they're saying that being mean to Muslims or
[03:38:45.979 --> 03:38:49.421]  Criticising Islam, which is what this is all about, is Islamophobic.
[03:38:50.541 --> 03:38:57.764]  It rejects concerns or claims criminalising comments about Islam will restrict free speech and calls for an official definition of Islamophobia.
[03:38:58.424 --> 03:39:11.190]  Examples of Islamophobia listed, including claiming it's terrorism to support an independent Palestine, calling Mohammed a paedophile, which is a fact, it's in the Quran, they want to classify that as a hate crime, telling the truth.
[03:39:11.250 --> 03:39:11.490]  In fact,
[03:39:12.219 --> 03:39:15.821]  I think it was a woman in Denmark that recently got prosecuted for saying exactly that.
[03:39:16.782 --> 03:39:25.007]  And claims of Muslims spreading Islam by the sword or subjugating minority groups under their rule, which is exactly what they do with the rape gangs.
[03:39:25.027 --> 03:39:32.691]  So all these factual instances of actual things happening, or things that are actually in the Quran, they're all going to be racist hate crimes, they're all going to be banned.
[03:39:33.011 --> 03:39:34.012]  Which brings me to this.
[03:39:35.593 --> 03:39:38.935]  Islamic sexual abuse of Sikh children pushed to one side for years.
[03:39:39.565 --> 03:39:42.287]  So again, we talk about subjugating a minority of people.
[03:39:42.967 --> 03:39:55.056]  A bombshell expose released November 26 revealed how gangs of predominantly Pakistani men, remember, 84% of rape gangs are made up of either Pakistanis or Bangladeshis in the UK.
[03:39:56.737 --> 03:40:00.380]  Pakistani men have sexually preyed on Sikh girls in the UK for decades.
[03:40:00.420 --> 03:40:06.404]  Authorities recklessly ignored the abuse due to concerns over, you guessed it, political correctness.
[03:40:07.208 --> 03:40:11.109]  So again, when people say, oh, political correctness is just being nice to people.
[03:40:11.509 --> 03:40:13.250]  No, it's damaging and harmful.
[03:40:13.630 --> 03:40:17.932]  Rotherham, 1,400 girls trafficked into sex slavery.
[03:40:18.752 --> 03:40:23.173]  The perpetrators, the gang rapists, were not caught because of political correctness.
[03:40:23.554 --> 03:40:24.694]  That came out in the report.
[03:40:24.734 --> 03:40:28.475]  The police didn't want to investigate it because they didn't want to be seen as racist.
[03:40:28.515 --> 03:40:31.796]  So political correctness does cause direct harm.
[03:40:32.657 --> 03:40:36.478]  Now, this new study published by the Seek Meditation and Rehabilitation Team charity
[03:40:37.893 --> 03:40:45.718]  Documented in shocking detail how young members of the Sikh community have been systematically groomed by Muslim men since the 1960s.
[03:40:46.398 --> 03:40:54.083]  Girls would be lured by fashionably dressed adult Pakistani men traveling in flamboyant vehicles to predominantly Sikh-dominated areas and schools.
[03:40:54.563 --> 03:40:57.285]  After initial contact they'd be groomed by one man who would then pass
[03:40:58.095 --> 03:41:00.416]  The victim onto other family members.
[03:41:00.917 --> 03:41:02.057]  So now this has come out.
[03:41:02.097 --> 03:41:05.739]  This is a scandal that's been ignored for decades and decades.
[03:41:06.219 --> 03:41:10.902]  But in Parliament, they're talking about banning criticism of Islam, which is what it will turn out to be.
[03:41:12.883 --> 03:41:17.325]  Jailed grooming gang rapist given chance to see victim's child by council.
[03:41:17.425 --> 03:41:18.746]  Yes, it gets even worse.
[03:41:19.386 --> 03:41:20.907]  I'll play this clip after the break.
[03:41:21.880 --> 03:41:24.981]  But this is one of the actual victims speaking out on Twitter about this.
[03:41:25.361 --> 03:41:30.542]  But a jailed sex offender was given the chance to play a part in the future of the child of a woman he raped.
[03:41:32.162 --> 03:41:38.563]  The man, who was reportedly part of a grooming gang, was contacted in jail by a council who gave him a chance to seek visits from the child.
[03:41:39.023 --> 03:41:40.403]  This is out of the Times of London.
[03:41:41.063 --> 03:41:43.684]  The newspaper did not name the local authority or the child's parents.
[03:41:43.704 --> 03:41:49.325]  Well, the mother herself, as you just saw there, went on Twitter and did name the local authority.
[03:41:50.302 --> 03:41:51.422]  And guess who it was?
[03:41:51.722 --> 03:41:53.383]  Yes, it was Rotherham again.
[03:41:53.683 --> 03:42:01.984]  The same local authority that betrayed, that ignored 1,400 child victims for well over a decade in that part of the world.
[03:42:02.884 --> 03:42:06.765]  As they tried to report the fact they were being groomed, they were being abducted, they were being raped.
[03:42:07.345 --> 03:42:16.046]  In some instances they would literally, the father of the child would go to the house where the victim was being raped, call the police from the house.
[03:42:16.367 --> 03:42:18.907]  The police would show up and arrest the father.
[03:42:19.784 --> 03:42:24.470]  That's how endemic this corruption is in Rotherham, which is not far from where I used to live in Sheffield.
[03:42:25.968 --> 03:42:35.933]  It is understood a senior Ministry of Justice official met the mother last week and has promised to explore whether it was a case of an individual social worker making a mistake.
[03:42:36.373 --> 03:42:49.919]  It's not a mistake, it's endemic in that council, has been for over a decade and they still haven't caught all the people who were involved in that horrific initial mass abduction and grooming of young girls
[03:42:50.579 --> 03:42:55.663]  Typically young white girls in other areas exceed girls in those areas of the United Kingdom.
[03:42:55.683 --> 03:42:58.505]  But no, it's those who need to be punished for our mean words on the internet.
[03:42:58.805 --> 03:42:59.285]  We'll be back.
[03:42:59.305 --> 03:43:00.586]  The Alex Jones Show live returns.
[03:43:00.666 --> 03:43:01.727]  Infowars.com.
[03:43:02.267 --> 03:43:12.494]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[03:43:12.895 --> 03:43:14.376]  And as we prepare to close out 2018,
[03:43:16.617 --> 03:43:24.959]  Isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[03:43:25.959 --> 03:43:32.621]  Or to say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man, well that's dead naming.
[03:43:32.901 --> 03:43:40.943]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[03:43:41.323 --> 03:43:44.464]  Then they say it's racist to say no, that it's okay to be white.
[03:43:44.824 --> 03:43:47.627]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation, or borders.
[03:43:48.047 --> 03:43:50.730]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told, is evil.
[03:43:51.171 --> 03:43:54.834]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[03:43:55.675 --> 03:43:57.617]  World War III was the Cold War.
[03:43:58.999 --> 03:44:00.700]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[03:44:01.101 --> 03:44:06.987]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU, and others,
[03:44:08.390 --> 03:44:26.759]  With the America-hating Hollywood crowd literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left because the globalists are threatened by first world nations, they're threatened by the middle class, they're threatened by the uppity-ness
[03:44:28.183 --> 03:44:29.424]  Of free market capitalism.
[03:44:30.004 --> 03:44:34.046]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[03:44:34.787 --> 03:44:36.408]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[03:44:36.848 --> 03:44:39.609]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[03:44:40.650 --> 03:44:41.991]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[03:44:42.071 --> 03:44:46.293]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[03:44:46.833 --> 03:44:49.595]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[03:44:51.084 --> 03:44:57.194]  But the globalists are counter-striking against independent patriot nationalist media like InfoWars.
[03:44:57.254 --> 03:45:01.701]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective.
[03:45:01.741 --> 03:45:04.505]  Thanks to your support, you have been the most effective.
[03:45:05.629 --> 03:45:07.150]  At exposing what's really happening.
[03:45:07.770 --> 03:45:12.072]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[03:45:12.532 --> 03:45:16.014]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[03:45:16.654 --> 03:45:20.636]  And I wanted just to remind you that InfoWars isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[03:45:21.856 --> 03:45:22.977]  And without you, we won't be here.
[03:45:23.577 --> 03:45:27.580]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[03:45:28.781 --> 03:45:31.122]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:45:31.602 --> 03:45:40.368]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[03:45:40.448 --> 03:45:43.110]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[03:45:43.570 --> 03:45:44.330]  We're good to go.
[03:46:10.003 --> 03:46:26.671]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding InfoWars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[03:46:27.171 --> 03:46:38.396]  And you are provisioning and funding not just the Second American Revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[03:46:39.216 --> 03:46:40.297]  Forced sterilization.
[03:46:40.657 --> 03:46:41.978]  Children being sterilized.
[03:46:42.458 --> 03:46:45.419]  This is pure, total, absolute evil.
[03:46:45.519 --> 03:46:49.261]  And InfoWars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[03:46:49.561 --> 03:46:51.882]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny.
[03:46:52.163 --> 03:46:53.643]  And we will fight until the end.
[03:46:54.064 --> 03:46:56.365]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[03:46:56.405 --> 03:46:58.526]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[03:46:59.066 --> 03:47:00.107]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:47:00.307 --> 03:47:00.727]  God bless you.
[03:47:06.101 --> 03:47:08.823]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.346 --> 03:47:21.590]  News, analysis, reports.

[03:47:23.951 --> 03:47:27.894]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:30.211 --> 03:47:31.551]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:31.571 --> 03:47:41.155]  Before we head back into some more news stories, I want to tell you about the great specials available at InfoWarsStore.com right now, where we have the Cyber Week special running.

[03:48:38.520 --> 03:48:42.341]  They're trying to undermine us, financially sabotage us at every available opportunity.
[03:48:42.381 --> 03:48:46.862]  So we rely on your support more than ever at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:48:47.882 --> 03:48:48.762]  Now there's a video
[03:48:49.654 --> 03:49:01.980]  I posted on Infowars.com this morning which was a migrant in Germany joking about basically how there are no Germans left in some German cities, at least in the daytime, because they're all at work.
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:03.561]  Let's go ahead and roll this video now.
[03:49:03.601 --> 03:49:05.582]  I'll talk over it because obviously it's in German.
[03:49:06.443 --> 03:49:09.844]  So it's introduced with this guy basically laughing his head off in a car.
[03:49:10.345 --> 03:49:14.847]  He says, an African asylum seeker, a black guy, is walking around the city of Nuremberg.
[03:49:15.347 --> 03:49:18.449]  He talks to the first person he sees and says, thank you for taking me in.
[03:49:20.419 --> 03:49:26.445]  That I may live here, for giving me health insurance, a place to live, food to eat, and everything else.
[03:49:26.565 --> 03:49:29.288]  The person says, I'm not German, I'm Albanian.
[03:49:29.688 --> 03:49:31.350]  The African says, oh, excuse me.
[03:49:31.711 --> 03:49:33.773]  He continues walking and speaks to the next person.
[03:49:34.113 --> 03:49:35.054]  He says, thank you.
[03:49:35.554 --> 03:49:36.395]  I may live in Germany.
[03:49:36.415 --> 03:49:37.917]  Thank you for everything you do for me.
[03:49:38.931 --> 03:49:41.232]  The person says, I'm not German, I'm Turkish.
[03:49:41.452 --> 03:49:43.473]  The African says, oh, excuse me.
[03:49:43.813 --> 03:49:45.974]  He continues walking and speaks to the next person.
[03:49:46.014 --> 03:49:48.455]  He says, thank you for allowing me to live in Germany.
[03:49:48.775 --> 03:49:50.295]  He took me in as a refugee.
[03:49:50.855 --> 03:49:52.836]  The person says, I'm not German, I'm Arab.
[03:49:53.256 --> 03:49:56.317]  The African asks, where are all the Germans?
[03:49:56.377 --> 03:50:00.159]  The Arab looks at his watch and says, probably working.
[03:50:00.779 --> 03:50:03.000]  So they're literally laughing.
[03:50:03.988 --> 03:50:10.354]  You've seen the stories about the refugee centres in Germany where they basically complain about the lack of food.
[03:50:10.394 --> 03:50:13.096]  Not the lack of food, the quality of the food is not good enough.
[03:50:13.436 --> 03:50:15.338]  And the lack of a Wi-Fi signal.
[03:50:15.958 --> 03:50:17.840]  Here's a headline out of Business Insider.
[03:50:18.220 --> 03:50:21.883]  The number of migrants claiming welfare benefits in Germany exploded last year.
[03:50:21.903 --> 03:50:25.867]  And this was in 2016, so it's way worse now.
[03:50:26.522 --> 03:50:33.747]  The number of migrants claiming German welfare benefits soared by 169% last year, typically in all these European countries.
[03:50:34.227 --> 03:50:39.671]  In Sweden, for example, the majority of welfare payments go to migrants.
[03:50:39.871 --> 03:50:52.439]  And yet we still hear this lame, inaccurate argument over and over again that we need to import vast numbers of people from Africa, from the Middle East, as a labour force because Europeans, ethnic Europeans, aren't having babies.
[03:50:52.459 --> 03:50:53.620]  Yet when we do import them,
[03:50:54.235 --> 03:51:02.417]  They go straight on welfare and make videos like that, laughing about how what few Germans there are out on the street in the daytime are basically not even there.
[03:51:02.517 --> 03:51:09.078]  They're all at work funding the lifestyle of newly arrived migrants who are laughing in their face about it.
[03:51:11.019 --> 03:51:17.240]  Related to that story right here, men of migrant background hurl firecracker at Hebrew-speaking journo in Berlin.
[03:51:18.266 --> 03:51:25.528]  An Israeli journalist later tweeted that she and her cameraman had been called to police to give a statement, although she refused to label the attack as anti-Semitic.
[03:51:25.888 --> 03:51:30.049]  So basically, it was a news reporter on camera reporting from Berlin.
[03:51:30.069 --> 03:51:33.450]  These migrants come up behind her, start laughing at her, start harassing her.
[03:51:34.850 --> 03:51:38.831]  She shows signs of disapproval and they respond by throwing a firecracker at her.
[03:51:38.851 --> 03:51:40.231]  That's one of their favourite things to do.
[03:51:40.271 --> 03:51:44.552]  We saw that during the mass rape of women in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015.
[03:51:44.972 --> 03:51:47.533]  The left says, oh, are you afraid of fireworks?
[03:51:48.487 --> 03:51:51.968]  Well yeah, if someone's throwing one at your face, it's kind of an inconvenience.
[03:51:53.048 --> 03:51:58.470]  Somali Muslim arrested for attempting to mow down Jews with car in front of LA Synagogue.
[03:51:58.770 --> 03:52:00.030]  This was completely buried.
[03:52:00.050 --> 03:52:01.691]  This happened a few days ago.
[03:52:02.111 --> 03:52:03.291]  Did you read about it in the news?
[03:52:03.531 --> 03:52:06.312]  Hardly any publications covered this.
[03:52:07.332 --> 03:52:10.153]  Los Angeles police are investigating an incident Friday night.
[03:52:11.067 --> 03:52:21.197]  As a potential hate crime, after a Somali man, 32-year-old Mohamed Mohamed Abdi, one Mohamed was not enough, attempted to run down worshippers standing outside Hancock Park Synagogue.
[03:52:22.318 --> 03:52:25.841]  According to witnesses, Abdi was yelling, effing Jews, effing Jews.
[03:52:26.242 --> 03:52:27.183]  Motive unknown.
[03:52:28.224 --> 03:52:33.509]  Abdi reportedly insulted another couple leaving the synagogue before getting into his car, attempting to run over two men.
[03:52:34.614 --> 03:52:37.796]  He later crashed into another car nearby, which time he was arrested.
[03:52:38.197 --> 03:52:41.519]  A Quran was found on the dashboard of his car.
[03:52:41.920 --> 03:52:43.461]  Again, motive unknown.
[03:52:44.441 --> 03:52:51.547]  LAPD announced Mohamed Mohamed Abdi was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and with a hate crime specification.
[03:52:52.027 --> 03:52:57.691]  So he was charged with the right charge, but again, you probably didn't see that story on CNN.
[03:52:58.612 --> 03:53:03.736]  Macron, Globalist Posterboy's polls plunged to historic low, Le Pen now more popular.
[03:53:04.787 --> 03:53:14.635]  Of course over the weekend we had riots in Paris and other major cities from people complaining about him raising the fuel tax to fight global warming.
[03:53:14.675 --> 03:53:23.923]  They were all wearing their high-vis yellow jackets as a kind of inside joke because by law you have to have a high-vis yellow jacket in every single vehicle.
[03:53:23.963 --> 03:53:25.064]  That's literally a law.
[03:53:25.685 --> 03:53:28.247]  So they were out on the streets getting beaten and tear gassed.
[03:53:29.065 --> 03:53:33.709]  Because they're refusing to pay these taxes, which Emmanuel Macron has instituted to fight global warming.
[03:53:34.249 --> 03:53:40.154]  And now his approval is at the most unpopular French president in history.
[03:53:40.734 --> 03:53:48.360]  At this stage of his presidential term, he now registers a mere 26 approval, according to figures by pollsters BVA.
[03:53:49.853 --> 03:53:55.158]  And in comparison to AFD and other people like that, he's not doing too well.
[03:53:56.419 --> 03:53:57.099]  26% approval.
[03:53:57.520 --> 03:53:59.521]  He was only elected just over a year ago.
[03:54:00.702 --> 03:54:02.844]  People say Trump's got bad approval figures.
[03:54:02.884 --> 03:54:05.446]  You compare that to Macron, he's basically double.
[03:54:06.307 --> 03:54:07.428]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:54:09.511 --> 03:54:12.512]  Now, back in America, of course, we have the situation at the border.
[03:54:13.072 --> 03:54:15.954]  Tear gas used once a month at border under Obama.
[03:54:16.034 --> 03:54:22.916]  How many celebrities did you see tweeting their hysteria at that single use of tear gas over the weekend?
[03:54:23.417 --> 03:54:36.262]  Well, it turns out the same tear gas agent that the Trump administration is taking heat for deploying against a border mob is actually used fairly frequently, including more than once a month during the latter years of President Barack Obama's administration.
[03:54:36.934 --> 03:54:42.907]  Another headline here says Obama used tear gas at least 80 times at the border between 2012 and 2017.
[03:54:46.801 --> 03:54:49.683]  RT reports mostly men, some not seeking asylum.
[03:54:49.703 --> 03:54:52.785]  Migrant Caravan reporter appears to bust MSN narrative.
[03:54:53.066 --> 03:55:00.771]  An MSNBC reporter, and we have the clip here, actually told the truth about the fact that these people are not seeking asylum.
[03:55:00.791 --> 03:55:09.057]  The vast majority of them are men who are seeking jobs, who are seeking work in the United States, illegally emigrating to try to get that work.
[03:55:09.077 --> 03:55:09.897]  Let's go to the clip.
[03:55:09.917 --> 03:55:13.320]  This is the MSNBC reporter actually telling the truth.
[03:55:14.497 --> 03:55:21.242]  Because some people look at these images and they listen to the president who says, it's not women and children, it's stone-cold criminals.
[03:55:21.662 --> 03:55:25.085]  So my first question is, you're in that tent camp.
[03:55:25.385 --> 03:55:31.109]  Besides that family, give us a profile of who is there mostly and what are they looking for?
[03:55:31.349 --> 03:55:38.734]  Because it seems as though, to your point, they don't actually have the necessary information so they know how to cross the border.
[03:55:38.774 --> 03:55:43.758]  There could be people yesterday who were running because they thought it was their only chance.
[03:55:46.369 --> 03:55:46.569]  Right.
[03:55:46.889 --> 03:55:50.052]  And it's very difficult because this has become such a polarizing issue.
[03:55:50.072 --> 03:55:52.493]  If we kind of take a walk, you'll be able to see for yourself.
[03:55:52.914 --> 03:55:55.455]  Again, this is the inner sanctum of the shelter.
[03:55:56.076 --> 03:56:00.039]  So you're going to see a lot of families here, a lot of women and children.
[03:56:00.499 --> 03:56:09.625]  But the truth is the majority of the people that are part of this caravan, especially outside, if we can make our way all the way over there, we'll show you the majority of them are men.
[03:56:09.725 --> 03:56:12.227]  So when this becomes a polarized political
[03:56:12.227 --> 03:56:12.627]  We're good to go.
[03:56:39.130 --> 03:56:39.790]  So there you have it.
[03:56:40.210 --> 03:56:42.791]  A broken clock is right twice a day, isn't it?
[03:56:42.851 --> 03:56:46.191]  An MSNBC reporter actually admits the truth that most of them are men.
[03:56:46.391 --> 03:56:48.132]  Most of them aren't seeking asylum.
[03:56:48.292 --> 03:56:52.113]  They're seeking work and they're illegally emigrating to try to get those jobs.
[03:56:52.873 --> 03:57:06.896]  Meanwhile, American Mirror reports Dem Reps send UN inspectors to US Border Democratic Representative Barbara Lee wants the United Nations to decide who should be allowed into the United States and whether or not America has the right to protect her borders.
[03:57:08.096 --> 03:57:08.736]  She tweeted,
[03:57:09.455 --> 03:57:12.298]  Accusing border agents of violating human rights.
[03:57:12.498 --> 03:57:17.103]  Quote, I've called for UN inspectors on the border and I reiterate that call today.
[03:57:17.604 --> 03:57:20.127]  Of course, Oscar Cortez also
[03:57:21.033 --> 03:57:25.434]  Compared the migrants to Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany.
[03:57:25.614 --> 03:57:27.734]  Absolutely absurd comparison.
[03:57:28.335 --> 03:57:34.716]  But the UN has absolutely no jurisdiction within the United States, so they can basically go whistle.
[03:57:34.756 --> 03:57:37.116]  There aren't going to be any UN troops at the border.
[03:57:37.377 --> 03:57:41.657]  The Border Patrol and the National Guard can do the job just fine.
[03:57:42.038 --> 03:57:43.438]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour.
[03:57:43.458 --> 03:57:45.818]  Coming up is War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:46.258 --> 03:57:47.999]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:57:48.319 --> 03:57:48.799]  Don't go away.
[03:57:55.253 --> 03:57:57.415]  Chase the Patriot from California.
[03:57:57.775 --> 03:57:58.355]  Hello Alex.
[03:57:58.756 --> 03:57:59.937]  Chase, welcome to the airwaves.
[03:58:00.037 --> 03:58:02.779]  This is Chase the Patriot from the front lines of California.
[03:58:02.819 --> 03:58:06.001]  So, I took your reporter challenge on YouTube, Chase the Patriot.
[03:58:06.042 --> 03:58:08.984]  I've been filing reports every single day, but I've noticed a trend.
[03:58:09.084 --> 03:58:11.846]  And there's this false confidence of the Democrats again.
[03:58:11.886 --> 03:58:13.547]  The same thing we saw in the 2016 election.
[03:58:13.567 --> 03:58:14.048]  So it's up to us.
[03:58:15.589 --> 03:58:16.049]  We're good to go.
[03:58:36.365 --> 03:58:37.045]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:58:37.065 --> 03:58:39.306]  When I say these shirts are like choose your own adventure.
[03:58:39.766 --> 03:58:43.086]  Wear a mohawn lomba, you'll only meet fellow patriots and gun owners, which is great.
[03:58:43.206 --> 03:58:48.348]  Wear a, you know, big obnoxious InfoWars shirt in red or a Trump Pence shirt, you're going to meet your friends and your enemies.
[03:58:48.388 --> 03:58:52.508]  So it's a really great way to spread the word and exercise free speech in the third dimension.
[03:58:52.608 --> 03:58:54.969]  Hey, and one more suggestion on that.
[03:58:55.049 --> 03:58:59.770]  You know, a lot of us have, we might have, I don't want to give away anything, but some of us might
