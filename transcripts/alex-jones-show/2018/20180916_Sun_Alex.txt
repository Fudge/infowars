[00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.071]  Yeah.
[00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:42.847]  It's now only 50 days.
[00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:47.368]  50 days out from what undoubtedly will be the most historic election in world history.
[00:00:47.408 --> 00:00:48.968]  Getting Trump in was only the fluke.
[00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:50.529]  It was only the beachhead.
[00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.029]  You see, the globalists hope it was a fluke.
[00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.390]  It really wasn't.
[00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.551]  Populism and nationalism is exploding across the globe as we speak.
[00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:03.172]  Thanks for joining us on this live Sunday, the 16th day already of September 2018.
[00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:06.613]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.254]  And let's get battened down here.
[00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:18.377]  Batten down the hatches, because we'll have the latest hurricane news as it deluges the Carolinas in record floods, obviously.
[00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:28.520]  But the big flood is the diarrhea of the mouth coming out of the reanimated corpse, the perfect rotting edifice of the corrupt Democratic Party.
[00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:33.202]  Joe Biden refers to Trump supporters as dregs of society.
[00:01:33.222 --> 00:01:35.643]  The video's up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:36.823]  But then it gets better.
[00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:38.064]  Oh, it gets better.
[00:01:38.344 --> 00:01:38.844]  He talks about
[00:01:39.364 --> 00:01:42.666]  The men in white hoods with torches are coming.
[00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.467]  He's talking about the Democratic Party.
[00:01:45.868 --> 00:01:50.191]  And the Republicans want to have the KKK enslave black people.
[00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:53.292]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[00:01:55.154 --> 00:01:58.776]  But this is the guy they have planning to run against Trump in two years?
[00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:01.898]  I mean, look, Joe Biden
[00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:09.942]  Looks like a dead body that Frankenstein electrocuted and that stood back up on its hind legs.
[00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:14.307]  So we're going to be playing all of this coming up today and a lot more.
[00:02:15.328 --> 00:02:22.215]  Our favorite socialist dingbat, she's not caught out wearing $3,600 outfits, says she wants $40 trillion of free stuff for the American people.
[00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:30.128]  Even though the entire global elite themselves don't even have $10 trillion.
[00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:32.208]  They're the ones, by the way, backing her.
[00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:39.950]  But when she was confronted even by liberals that, well, there's only, you know, $2 trillion out there in discretionary money.
[00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.891]  She just said, well, I don't care what you say.
[00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:44.771]  We're going to do it anyway.
[00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:46.392]  So that's amazing video.
[00:02:46.412 --> 00:02:50.393]  But let's get to this first piece and I'll play the larger piece when we come back from break.
[00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:55.574]  This is Joe Biden jumping the shark going further than saying just that.
[00:02:57.216 --> 00:02:58.617]  Trump supporters are deplorable?
[00:02:59.117 --> 00:02:59.678]  No, no, no, no.
[00:03:00.198 --> 00:03:04.181]  He says Trump supporters are the dregs of society.
[00:03:04.221 --> 00:03:09.245]  Have you looked in the mirror at the poor sad saps conned by the Democrats?
[00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:10.506]  I mean, they are the dregs.
[00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:18.772]  And then the scum of society, the worst, the Count Draculas of society, are ruling over this throng of pathetic slaves.
[00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:19.533]  Here he is.
[00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:32.181]  Losing in the courts, and in the court of public opinion, these forces of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you all have made.
[00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:38.586]  This time, they, not you, have an ally in the White House.
[00:03:39.107 --> 00:03:41.128]  This time, they have an ally.
[00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.432]  They're a small percentage of the American people, virulent people.
[00:03:47.153 --> 00:03:48.895]  Some of them the dregs of society.
[00:03:50.017 --> 00:04:03.544]  And instead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, safety for all, the president uses the White House as a literal, literal bully pulpit.
[00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:10.168]  Callously, callously exerting his power over those who have little or none.
[00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.669]  Some of you in this room
[00:04:13.604 --> 00:04:23.692]  Maybe fortunate enough to live in cities or work for companies, or protected by law or by policy, with privilege and access to defend yourselves and your families.
[00:04:24.993 --> 00:04:30.157]  But across the country, too many of our fellow Americans lack those basic comforts.
[00:04:31.658 --> 00:04:34.040]  And that's especially true for young people.
[00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.043]  Many of you are familiar with the Trevor Project.
[00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:43.423]  Alright, well this is just total loads of bull if you know the facts.
[00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:45.444]  I mean Trump's bringing the prosperity for everybody.
[00:04:45.804 --> 00:04:47.224]  These guys suppress it on purpose.
[00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:48.665]  Look at blue cities they run.
[00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:52.127]  Hell holes of degradation and pain.
[00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:55.148]  It's all coming up on this live global transmission.
[00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:58.350]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.052]  Spread those links or we don't have any hope against these horrible bloodsuckers.
[00:05:03.666 --> 00:05:10.930]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:18.854]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:22.316]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:27.219]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.522]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:05:31.742 --> 00:05:34.464]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:39.147]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:05:39.648 --> 00:05:42.650]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:57.923]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:05:58.183 --> 00:05:59.464]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:01.886]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you
[00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.177]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:15.598 --> 00:06:18.468]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:06:28.268 --> 00:06:30.049]  It's Sunday, September 16, 2018.
[00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.450]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.231]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:35.611]  Central.
[00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:37.512]  We're back weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:06:37.532 --> 00:06:38.052]  to 3 p.m.
[00:06:38.072 --> 00:06:43.214]  on all the other great live broadcasts we have that's simulcast on AM and FM stations, TV, cable, around the country.
[00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:48.956]  I saw the new talking point over the weekend from CNBC, Reuters, CNN.
[00:06:50.517 --> 00:06:55.299]  After the fall of Alex Jones, the rise and fall of Alex Jones,
[00:06:56.288 --> 00:06:58.028]  We have a bigger audience than we've ever had.
[00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:00.629]  I've got our own internal numbers.
[00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:05.450]  I've shown the videos just a week and a half ago on Twitter before they banned that.
[00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.170]  Look, here's Google Analytics.
[00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.471]  Record traffic.
[00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:18.453]  But they want that perception that if you don't go along with the globalists, if you don't go along with open borders or gun control, you're not going to get an admission to college.
[00:07:18.853 --> 00:07:20.273]  You're not going to get a corporate job.
[00:07:20.553 --> 00:07:22.454]  You're not going to have any access online.
[00:07:22.834 --> 00:07:24.114]  You better submit.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:31.743]  So they're trying to bully the American people, and now it's come out the tables have been turned.
[00:07:32.504 --> 00:07:38.827]  ThinkProgress, another Jordan Soros funded fake news outlet, gets censored by Facebook fact checkers.
[00:07:39.848 --> 00:07:42.909]  Stories up on Infowars.com got picked up by a bunch of publications.
[00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.672]  And here they are calling for me to be banned just a few weeks ago and celebrating it.
[00:07:48.592 --> 00:07:54.676]  And they're like, how dare Facebook censor us saying that, you know, Kavanaugh
[00:07:55.603 --> 00:07:58.185]  said that he wants to overturn Roe v. Wade, which he never said.
[00:07:58.966 --> 00:08:14.160]  And so they had the neocon outfit Weekly Standard come, and they're now part of the fact-checking group, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and Media Matters and George Soros groups, and Snopes, famously fake.
[00:08:16.038 --> 00:08:18.119]  So that's the group that lied about WMDs in Iraq.
[00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:19.900]  That's the group that was never Trump.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:29.344]  That's the group that has been involved in so much corruption, headed up by Mr. Kristol, whose father was the head of the Trotskyites and a famous communist, worked for Leon Trotsky.
[00:08:30.724 --> 00:08:32.325]  That is one of the worst groups you could have.
[00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:36.307]  But of course they've got the Democrats coming in and censoring.
[00:08:36.347 --> 00:08:43.130]  And now we've got to have token conservatives from the Weekly Standard, who are even worse than the Democrats in many cases, warmongering neocons.
[00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:55.467]  And they'll be the new superclass that decides what's real and not, and so they'll just remove it off Facebook and then give a warning to ThinkProgress that if you do this anymore, we may ban you.
[00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:00.308]  Think about that.
[00:09:01.968 --> 00:09:09.470]  A ruling Republican-Democrat blue-blood establishment that decides who and who can't post and what's real and what isn't.
[00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.650]  Oh, there'll be no one fact-checking.
[00:09:13.018 --> 00:09:29.709]  Weekly Standard or CNN, even though Anderson Cooper got caught standing there up to his chest in a creek, claiming he was amongst flooded houses with his crew all standing around him on dry ground, or the Weather Channel with a guy being blown everywhere and people just stroll right past him like it's no big deal.
[00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:31.090]  We all know what's fake.
[00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:32.971]  We can make our own decision.
[00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:35.673]  We can smell the truth, as Tucker Carlson says.
[00:09:36.513 --> 00:09:40.276]  So let it all rise or fall and let the people decide.
[00:09:41.189 --> 00:09:51.656]  Don't have fact checkers, failed CNN, failed New York Times, failed Weekly Standard that loses money every month.
[00:09:52.536 --> 00:10:00.061]  Don't have them as the new super class that is up there deciding what you can and can't see.
[00:10:00.462 --> 00:10:01.802]  Let us see it all.
[00:10:02.283 --> 00:10:05.525]  But see, we're not being banned and restricted because InfoWars is a lie.
[00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:11.302]  We're being banned and restricted because what we're saying is the truth and is viral and is infectious.
[00:10:11.682 --> 00:10:12.243]  And here's the key.
[00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:25.071]  They want to remove us off air so that they can then lie about us and say whatever they want by building a straw man and going to the ring or the arena and beat us up.
[00:10:29.614 --> 00:10:33.356]  And then we don't have a chance to respond.
[00:10:35.438 --> 00:10:38.201]  You want to see the article, we'll pull it up from Infowars.com.
[00:10:38.842 --> 00:10:43.106]  Anderson Cooper caught in massive fake news.
[00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:48.952]  Anderson Cooper caught in deception of the American people.
[00:10:51.695 --> 00:10:54.358]  Anderson Cooper caught in major performance art.
[00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:58.242]  Can't they even report?
[00:11:03.118 --> 00:11:03.838]  On the weather?
[00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:05.319]  Accurately?
[00:11:06.219 --> 00:11:07.600]  Can't they even do that?
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.222]  And the answer is, no they can't because they're all about deception.
[00:11:12.462 --> 00:11:14.863]  They teach in journalism school how to lie now.
[00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:18.645]  Remember Gruber?
[00:11:19.806 --> 00:11:23.087]  Said he was hired by Obama to lie to people and Obama admitted it.
[00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:28.670]  And he's up there at universities giving speeches to graduate students about how to be a better liar and how to deceive people.
[00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.751]  And they're all rubbing their hands together like he's God.
[00:11:34.124 --> 00:11:44.775]  So the fact that they've gotten away with so much to them means, well, Trump only got in because we didn't lie enough, you see.
[00:11:45.215 --> 00:11:48.719]  But they can't have the real fact-checkers out there like InfoWars.
[00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:54.656]  They can't have us there because then it calls them on their lies.
[00:11:55.137 --> 00:12:05.941]  They want to, as a big corporate massive group, lie to us en masse and not have anyone be able to oppose it or respond to it in any way.
[00:12:07.302 --> 00:12:08.462]  Now we come back from break.
[00:12:09.283 --> 00:12:15.665]  A lengthy Joe Biden speech that tells whopper after whopper after whopper.
[00:12:15.685 --> 00:12:19.267]  And I'm going to try to just get to a few clips of it and just analyze the lies that are there.
[00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:35.400]  It is like the worst around the fire stories you're trying to tell when you're out camping with your dad and your grandpa and they try to scare you when you're five years old and they go, let us tell you the story of the headless ghoul that rides through this area of Texas.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:46.627]  Oh, he's got big red eyes and big long fangs and he's got a forked tail and just legend has it near here a few years ago he grabbed some kids during the night
[00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:54.753]  He's up there going, they ride on horses with white hoods, burning torches and Trump wouldn't stop them.
[00:12:55.694 --> 00:12:57.095]  They're the KKK.
[00:12:57.255 --> 00:13:06.501]  I mean, it is the most ridiculous lies when it's the Democratic Party and the Republicans that passed the Civil Rights Act.
[00:13:06.601 --> 00:13:11.004]  Martin Luther King was a Republican, but the public doesn't have history, so they don't know.
[00:13:12.845 --> 00:13:13.886]  That's all coming up.
[00:13:14.983 --> 00:13:17.904]  In the next segment, and Matt Drudge warns of midterm bloodbath.
[00:13:19.185 --> 00:13:22.406]  Trump to lose 60 seats in the House like Obama, unless.
[00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:24.027]  We'll give you the unless.
[00:13:24.807 --> 00:13:32.870]  We've got Cortez on how she'd pay $40 trillion for socialist programs with $2 trillion falling flat on her face.
[00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:42.674]  We've got the New York Times and others now saying that, again, Obama gets credit for the economy, but since Trump's getting credit, let's just change how the numbers are looked at.
[00:13:43.462 --> 00:13:45.443]  Hollywood celebrates Paul Manafort guilty plea.
[00:13:46.023 --> 00:13:47.223]  Checkmate F.U.
[00:13:47.283 --> 00:13:47.603]  Trump.
[00:13:48.403 --> 00:13:52.185]  But it's... He's pleading guilty on not paying taxes.
[00:13:53.885 --> 00:13:54.365]  15 years ago.
[00:13:54.485 --> 00:13:55.706]  So where's your Russiagate?
[00:13:55.966 --> 00:13:56.846]  See, it's not that now.
[00:13:58.306 --> 00:14:01.547]  We're also going to look at young girl raped by 100 Islamic men.
[00:14:01.947 --> 00:14:04.528]  You'll see how the mainstream media spun that.
[00:14:05.008 --> 00:14:07.129]  And so much more here today.
[00:14:11.138 --> 00:14:12.858]  And we also have an amazing report from Emily Weaver.
[00:14:12.878 --> 00:14:16.839]  Democrats are desperate for black vote, but they're not getting it, and that's why they're so scared.
[00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:19.340]  Another key report as well.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:30.663]  When I had Eric Bolling, formerly of Fox News, now with CRTV, here in studio last week, he said, you know, how dare you say there were bombs in the buildings?
[00:14:30.763 --> 00:14:32.043]  How dare you say that?
[00:14:32.884 --> 00:14:36.284]  And I said, Eric, I have clips of Trump saying it.
[00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:37.925]  He said, I want to see them.
[00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:43.097]  We're five minutes towards the end of the show and I said, I'll make a special video for you.
[00:14:43.617 --> 00:14:45.257]  And then we'll air it, then I'll send you that video.
[00:14:45.297 --> 00:14:46.878]  So we're going to premiere it here tonight.
[00:14:48.439 --> 00:14:49.239]  Start of the next hour.
[00:14:50.359 --> 00:14:51.940]  And Roger Stone's on Big Exclusive News.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.341]  And then I'm going to put it up to Infowars.com on our own video feeds.
[00:14:56.722 --> 00:14:59.363]  And we're going to send that out to Mr. Bowling.
[00:14:59.823 --> 00:15:00.523]  He's a good guy.
[00:15:00.844 --> 00:15:01.284]  He means well.
[00:15:01.304 --> 00:15:01.904]  He's a boy scout.
[00:15:02.864 --> 00:15:04.225]  And he's an economist.
[00:15:06.098 --> 00:15:11.862]  And he just can't believe where I get this stuff that I heard that day there were bombs in the buildings.
[00:15:11.902 --> 00:15:15.865]  Now maybe that's not true, but the media attacked me and said it never happened.
[00:15:18.266 --> 00:15:19.647]  I talked to the police that said no.
[00:15:20.268 --> 00:15:22.569]  The feds were inside building 7 and said get ready.
[00:15:22.849 --> 00:15:24.871]  They had a 10 second countdown and blew it up.
[00:15:26.067 --> 00:15:26.507]  And guess what?
[00:15:26.547 --> 00:15:31.130]  On PBS, inadvertently, they had the video of the countdown and 7 being blown up.
[00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.191]  So you're going to see all that.
[00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:33.632]  It's a 6-minute video.
[00:15:33.652 --> 00:15:36.294]  We've got a 15-minute one coming out Tuesday.
[00:15:37.154 --> 00:15:38.996]  So I'm just going to show you why I question.
[00:15:39.016 --> 00:15:40.357]  Doesn't mean I don't think Islamic terror is real.
[00:15:40.777 --> 00:15:41.157]  None of that.
[00:15:41.337 --> 00:15:46.961]  It means we've been lied to and there's a criminal alliance bipartisanly with radical Islam that needs to stop.
[00:15:48.102 --> 00:15:49.162]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:50.563 --> 00:15:51.584]  Newswars.com.

[00:19:05.523 --> 00:19:06.924]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:06.984 --> 00:19:08.845]  Victor, you're calling, go ahead.
[00:19:08.945 --> 00:19:10.366]  Yes, hi Alex.
[00:19:10.486 --> 00:19:16.690]  First, I just want to mention if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.872]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:21.113 --> 00:19:22.574]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:22.934 --> 00:19:29.838]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it like
[00:19:30.138 --> 00:19:32.780]  I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.262]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[00:19:36.562 --> 00:19:38.143]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:38.183 --> 00:19:46.008]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:19:46.048 --> 00:19:51.872]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Coil Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:51.992 --> 00:19:53.473]  It is our highest reviewed product.
[00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:57.315]  Because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:19:57.376 --> 00:20:00.418]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're gonna find to a silver bullet.
[00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:08.763]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.267 --> 00:20:19.350]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:40.862 --> 00:20:46.988]  So, we always hear that Trump is this really mean person, he wants to shut down free speech.
[00:20:48.189 --> 00:20:50.391]  But he's not calling for shutting down anybody's free speech.
[00:20:51.232 --> 00:20:57.497]  It's the mainstream corporate media that wants all conservatives, all libertarians, all Christians, all veterans groups banned off the internet.
[00:20:57.517 --> 00:20:58.478]  We've got U.S.
[00:20:58.498 --> 00:21:02.242]  Senators Wyden and Warner and Murphy
[00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:05.617]  Saying Alex Jones is only the beginning.
[00:21:05.677 --> 00:21:06.797]  Get rid of thousands.
[00:21:06.877 --> 00:21:08.097]  Get rid of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:21:08.117 --> 00:21:13.019]  We have the Federal Election Commission persecuting anybody that donates to Republicans.
[00:21:13.619 --> 00:21:16.560]  We have the IRS going after churches and Christian groups.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.320]  We have a reign of terror and bullying going on.
[00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:31.904]  But then we've got Joe Biden with all of his corruption and protecting Bill Clinton who protected Al Qaeda and then supporting the Arab Spring under Obama and Hillary.
[00:21:33.513 --> 00:21:41.179]  And Uranium One and the KKK background of the Democrats saying that he wants to pick a fight with bullies.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.081]  Meaning Trump and their supporters.
[00:21:44.121 --> 00:21:55.691]  No, you're the ones beating us over the head with bike locks, throwing coffee on us, shooting Congressman Scalise, calling for Trump's overthrow, calling for the economy to be destroyed so that we can stop Trump.
[00:21:56.311 --> 00:21:57.132]  That's the Democrats.
[00:22:00.046 --> 00:22:03.449]  But now he says we're the dregs of society.
[00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:05.210]  Let's look up the definition of dregs.
[00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:15.277]  It means winos, drug addicts, pickpockets, thugs, child molesters, murderers, ex-convicts.
[00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:17.079]  The lowest of the low.
[00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:21.742]  The remains of liquid left in a container together with sediment or grounds.
[00:22:22.142 --> 00:22:23.964]  The most worthless parts of something.
[00:22:25.632 --> 00:22:27.473]  The crap inside intestines.
[00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:29.894]  You can take pig intestines and make chitlins.
[00:22:30.054 --> 00:22:31.034]  Gotta clean out the crap.
[00:22:31.715 --> 00:22:33.716]  Boil the guts and then fry them.
[00:22:33.976 --> 00:22:34.336]  I've had them.
[00:22:34.356 --> 00:22:35.937]  It's a southern dish.
[00:22:37.457 --> 00:22:40.779]  But the dregs would be the guts.
[00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:41.799]  You'd throw out the dregs.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:49.603]  So if you go to a Democratic Party function or a liberal event, they look like they're dead.
[00:22:50.509 --> 00:22:53.173]  They look like they've been beaten the head with a baseball bat.
[00:22:53.794 --> 00:22:54.936]  They stumble around.
[00:22:55.036 --> 00:22:56.157]  Most people can hardly talk.
[00:22:56.678 --> 00:22:59.442]  And I don't feel powerful when I see a group of Democrats.
[00:23:00.225 --> 00:23:01.146]  I feel sorry for them.
[00:23:01.666 --> 00:23:06.191]  And that's why they're really censoring conservatives and nationalists off of Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[00:23:06.471 --> 00:23:23.067]  Because we would all, even under censorship, we used to have videos with 30, 40 million views, under censorship routinely a million, two million views, going out and just pointing a camera at a crowd of Democrats with the F your mother, white people are monkey subhumans, you know, we're gonna
[00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:24.841]  Kill you!
[00:23:25.602 --> 00:23:34.467]  And then you go to the next person, and the next person, and the next person, and the next person, and the next person, and they all sound like something out of a Hellraiser movie.
[00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:44.273]  So when he calls us dregs, think about the projection.
[00:23:45.595 --> 00:23:57.364]  That Joe Biden's involved in because Hillary in the WikiLeaks calls her supporters worthless, dumb, stupid baristas that want something more from her when they're lazy living in their mom's basement.
[00:23:57.404 --> 00:23:57.884]  Close quote.
[00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:00.746]  Trump says, I want to get you out of your mom's basement.
[00:24:01.187 --> 00:24:02.928]  I believe in you, whether you're white or black.
[00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:06.651]  And you see him try to move us an economy back and have a culture of working.
[00:24:07.051 --> 00:24:08.993]  And they flip out and say he's a loser.
[00:24:09.393 --> 00:24:10.454]  He's a crazy man.
[00:24:10.754 --> 00:24:13.236]  He's the worst thing since gonorrhea.
[00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:16.768]  So let's start going to this Joe Biden piece.
[00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.851]  Joe Biden refers to Trump supporters as dregs of society.
[00:24:23.052 --> 00:24:23.512]  Here he is.
[00:24:24.092 --> 00:24:25.213]  They have an ally.
[00:24:26.193 --> 00:24:28.415]  They're a small percentage of the American people.
[00:24:28.635 --> 00:24:29.595]  Virulent people.
[00:24:31.296 --> 00:24:33.077]  Some of them the dregs of society.
[00:24:33.878 --> 00:24:36.099]  They have an ally.
[00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:37.800]  So there's your dregs of society clip.
[00:24:38.703 --> 00:24:53.207]  Now let's go to a larger clip where he talks about the KKK riding through the night with burning torches, and they're coming to get you, like they're telling ghost stories to little kids, and they're the people that hate you if you're gay, and they're the people that hate you if you're black.
[00:24:53.848 --> 00:24:54.728]  But here's the good news.
[00:24:55.908 --> 00:25:03.831]  Americans, no matter what color they are or where they came from, are figuring out that the Trump economy is a lot better, that the establishment is against Trump.
[00:25:03.851 --> 00:25:05.331]  So let's go ahead and start going to this.
[00:25:09.281 --> 00:25:09.861]  Gay marriage.
[00:25:11.242 --> 00:25:20.987]  But this onslaught that we're seeing does require, require us not only to be vigilant, but be more aggressive and demand more.
[00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:29.732]  Demand more of our leaders who represent basic American values of respect, decency, equality.
[00:25:30.032 --> 00:25:31.693]  Giving hate no safe haven.
[00:25:31.873 --> 00:25:32.253]  Pause.
[00:25:33.073 --> 00:25:35.735]  Giving hate no safe haven.
[00:25:36.738 --> 00:25:56.047]  That means anything they define, the Second Amendment, the nuclear family, saying he or she being bad in the US, Canada, Sweden, being masculine, being feminine, whatever they want to define as something they want to attack, they say, don't give your speech safe haven.
[00:25:56.127 --> 00:25:57.368]  Believe me, we know bullies.
[00:25:57.868 --> 00:25:59.428]  You're not giving speech a safe haven.
[00:25:59.649 --> 00:26:00.229]  Let's continue.
[00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:02.370]  Behold these truths self-evident.
[00:26:03.539 --> 00:26:06.061]  All men are created equal, endowed by their creator.
[00:26:06.782 --> 00:26:08.183]  Sounds corny when you say it.
[00:26:09.463 --> 00:26:14.167]  But the American people, basically in their gut, we've never met it.
[00:26:15.248 --> 00:26:17.489]  But that's the aspiration, and they're not giving up on it.
[00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:18.330]  Let's pause again.
[00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:24.715]  It's true that those great ideas have never been met, but the idea of meeting it has brought us further than many other nations.
[00:26:25.195 --> 00:26:26.156]  In fact, probably more than anybody.
[00:26:27.008 --> 00:26:27.748]  The American system.
[00:26:27.768 --> 00:26:29.068]  So why are we the bad guys?
[00:26:29.488 --> 00:26:31.009]  Why do we have to be the Nazis?
[00:26:31.069 --> 00:26:34.109]  Why do we have to be the evil folks when our history doesn't show that?
[00:26:35.129 --> 00:26:43.691]  But again, this is coming to you from the Democratic Party and somebody that literally was under Senator Byrd, who was a grand dragon in the KKK.
[00:26:44.831 --> 00:26:45.651]  And the Democratic Party.
[00:26:45.851 --> 00:26:47.051]  But he thinks you have no memory.
[00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:47.631]  Let's continue.
[00:26:48.772 --> 00:26:55.013]  You know, Barack and I agreed to remain silent for a while to give this administration a chance to get up and running in the first year.
[00:26:55.033 --> 00:26:55.473]  Pause again.
[00:26:55.533 --> 00:26:56.353]  Back it up ten seconds.
[00:26:58.223 --> 00:26:59.905]  They were never quiet through their surrogates.
[00:26:59.965 --> 00:27:09.558]  It came out in all the different documents and lawsuits and FBI files that the Democrats, led by Obama, Hillary and others, have been orchestrating the fake PPGate dossier.
[00:27:09.939 --> 00:27:12.162]  They've been launching the attacks on Trump.
[00:27:12.482 --> 00:27:13.964]  They've been trying to block everything.
[00:27:14.765 --> 00:27:16.086]  Oh, but they gave him a chance.
[00:27:16.126 --> 00:27:17.606]  They tried to make him succeed.
[00:27:17.906 --> 00:27:22.788]  The media, the Democrats, you know, gave Trump that honeymoon period that every other president got.
[00:27:22.989 --> 00:27:23.169]  No!
[00:27:23.409 --> 00:27:24.929]  There was no honeymoon period.
[00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:26.850]  They tried to keep him from getting his delegates.
[00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.971]  They tried to keep him from even becoming the president.
[00:27:29.351 --> 00:27:34.393]  They tried to riot and block the entrances to his inauguration and then lied about who was there.
[00:27:36.574 --> 00:27:38.255]  Everything Biden says is a lie.
[00:27:38.335 --> 00:27:38.755]  Continue.
[00:27:39.756 --> 00:27:40.456]  We're not giving up on him.
[00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:48.371]  You know, Barack and I agreed to remain silent for a while to give this administration a chance to get up and running in the first year.
[00:27:51.872 --> 00:27:52.732]  God forgive me.
[00:27:52.752 --> 00:28:05.375]  I cannot remain silent after Charlottesville.
[00:28:05.875 --> 00:28:08.996]  I want to be deadly earnest with you about this.
[00:28:12.347 --> 00:28:13.188]  Charlottesville.
[00:28:13.388 --> 00:28:14.369]  One woman run over.
[00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:15.590]  God bless her.
[00:28:17.452 --> 00:28:20.555]  By a crowd attacking a car and the guy guns it and runs over her.
[00:28:20.915 --> 00:28:23.598]  And I point out that George Soros funded Antifa.
[00:28:23.918 --> 00:28:24.879]  The police stood down.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.584]  You have the alt-right people, who most of them used to work for the Democrats, clearly feds.
[00:28:30.485 --> 00:28:32.487]  You have this big production they do.
[00:28:32.927 --> 00:28:34.368]  Trump says both sides are bad.
[00:28:35.541 --> 00:28:43.511]  Antifa's bad, and I think KKK-type folks, KKK likes bad, but he said it's Antifa that attacked, which is totally true!
[00:28:45.464 --> 00:28:47.365]  And then, oh, this is their big thing.
[00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:49.767]  This guy funded the Arab Spring that killed millions of people.
[00:28:50.387 --> 00:28:55.211]  Biden, his son, runs part of Ukraine, all the stolen natural gas there.
[00:28:55.511 --> 00:28:56.431]  He's a monster.
[00:28:56.792 --> 00:29:00.014]  But he sits there and says America's ethos is the KKK.
[00:29:00.234 --> 00:29:01.255]  No, it's your ethos.
[00:29:15.847 --> 00:29:16.633]  Here's what you wanna know.
[00:29:17.602 --> 00:29:23.565]  You want to go to mfullmorestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[00:29:24.226 --> 00:29:27.768]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[00:29:28.648 --> 00:29:36.653]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:44.898]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[00:29:45.698 --> 00:29:49.463]  It's got the best of ancient science, with the latest developments as well.
[00:29:50.023 --> 00:29:53.948]  It's Alpha Power, and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[00:29:55.087 --> 00:30:09.935]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[00:30:10.355 --> 00:30:15.718]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[00:30:16.018 --> 00:30:17.559]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:19.199]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.400]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpapower.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.801]  Because I said, I want to dominate the industry.
[00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:28.663]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[00:30:28.683 --> 00:30:30.023]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[00:30:30.843 --> 00:30:38.066]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:39.506]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[00:30:40.087 --> 00:30:41.667]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[00:30:41.687 --> 00:30:42.807]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[00:30:42.867 --> 00:30:44.508]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:48.269]  But here's an example.
[00:30:49.109 --> 00:30:56.692]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[00:30:56.712 --> 00:30:58.412]  It just has a little bit in it.
[00:30:58.892 --> 00:31:05.054]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[00:31:05.754 --> 00:31:10.840]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:19.471]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:20.892]  Nobody else does that.
[00:31:20.972 --> 00:31:23.656]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[00:31:24.156 --> 00:31:40.292]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[00:31:40.712 --> 00:31:49.682]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[00:31:50.022 --> 00:31:52.065]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[00:31:52.445 --> 00:31:57.711]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:31:57.731 --> 00:31:58.152]  A total 360 win.
[00:32:11.852 --> 00:32:18.116]  After the success of Alpha Power, we decided to make a new powerhouse vitality formula built with the female biochemistry in mind.
[00:32:18.856 --> 00:32:23.719]  After searching for the incredible ingredients to meet those needs, we're proud to bring you Ultimate Female Force.

[00:33:06.087 --> 00:33:10.290]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.694 --> 00:33:15.995]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:16.816 --> 00:33:18.137]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.689 --> 00:33:46.191]  So Joe Biden came out and he went beyond saying that Trump supporters are deplorable.
[00:33:47.212 --> 00:33:54.054]  He went on to basically, well I mean here's the exact quote, the dregs of society which were already played.
[00:33:54.715 --> 00:34:04.939]  So getting back into his speech, he talks about the KKK riders and their hoods in the night and like they're galloping, they're galloping, they're galloping like you're
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.942]  In the woods, and here comes the evil rider to get you.
[00:34:12.962 --> 00:34:14.203]  Total fear-mongering.
[00:34:14.883 --> 00:34:18.245]  And is it lost on society that Democrats are the party of the KKK?
[00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:24.067]  Is it lost on everybody that they're the ones creating racial division in America at every level?
[00:34:24.348 --> 00:34:28.890]  And again, it's even in their own WikiLeaks that they want to create racial division to control people.
[00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.651]  Because they're not going to give you jobs, they're not going to give you a future like all the blue cities.
[00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:33.632]  They're going to give you
[00:34:34.963 --> 00:34:35.403]  Poverty.
[00:34:35.483 --> 00:34:36.784]  They're going to give you enslavement.
[00:34:36.804 --> 00:34:38.885]  They're going to give you being domesticated.
[00:34:43.148 --> 00:34:44.949]  The good news is, you look at the Democratic Party.
[00:34:45.189 --> 00:34:49.392]  They're led by Nancy Pelosi, who can hardly talk.
[00:34:50.152 --> 00:34:59.138]  They're led by Joe Biden, who looks like he was a dead body at the morgue that somebody hooked electricity up to that was reanimated for the speech.
[00:34:59.978 --> 00:35:02.820]  And he's spewing all the same old garbage.
[00:35:05.287 --> 00:35:11.610]  And so that's the good news is that people are sick of this and they're tired of it and they see through it.
[00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:21.895]  But Joe Biden is still a clear and present danger because he's not going to ever stop until he realizes that you're not buying into it.
[00:35:21.935 --> 00:35:34.021]  Because as I said earlier, when they overthrew Ukraine, the George Soros five years ago, his son took control of the $10 billion gas company that comes out of Russia.
[00:35:37.256 --> 00:35:40.079]  And he now makes hundreds of millions a year, his son.
[00:35:40.359 --> 00:35:43.042]  That's an example of the criminal looting.
[00:35:43.082 --> 00:35:47.808]  They're not going to stop until the last minute, because they're stealing the whole time.
[00:35:48.528 --> 00:35:50.651]  That's why they're never going to back down, they're never going to give up.
[00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:55.856]  And they're also like cornered rats, so there's no end to what they will do now.
[00:35:56.337 --> 00:35:58.299]  They are so dangerous, they are so evil.
[00:35:58.619 --> 00:35:59.200]  Let's continue.
[00:36:01.954 --> 00:36:07.358]  That's why I wrote an article in Atlantic Magazine entitled, The Battle for America's Soul.
[00:36:08.959 --> 00:36:09.779]  Don't clap.
[00:36:09.799 --> 00:36:11.521]  You can boo if you want, but don't clap.
[00:36:13.742 --> 00:36:14.563]  But I'm serious.
[00:36:15.583 --> 00:36:16.224]  I'm serious.
[00:36:17.605 --> 00:36:23.209]  This is about basic decency.
[00:36:23.649 --> 00:36:30.254]  The idea that goons could come out of fields at night with lighted torches
[00:36:31.545 --> 00:36:41.568]  Carrying Nazi flights chanting the same exact anti-semitic bile that was chanted in the streets of Nuremberg and Berlin.
[00:36:41.608 --> 00:36:42.569]  Let's hit pause again.
[00:36:42.669 --> 00:36:49.951]  Look at how he drools the same anti-semitic bile that was chanted in the streets of Germany.
[00:36:52.712 --> 00:36:53.332]  When it was
[00:36:56.158 --> 00:37:00.739]  George Soros, who was the Nazi collaborator, and is the main funder of the Democrats.
[00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:07.780]  When it's Juncker, whose family was the richest family in Germany, as Nazis, who run the EU today, that was a Hitler plan.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.361]  When they're the ones using racial division.
[00:37:14.121 --> 00:37:23.503]  But they've got it set up in Hollywood like, if you're American, and you're pro-freedom, and you're pro-Second Amendment, and you're pro-free market, you are a Nazi!
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:47.928]  And now you saw where a guy at the Coast Guard headquarters, being pro-Trump, did this sign, and they removed him, fired him off the job, and the Coast Guard apologized for the Nazi sign.
[00:37:48.388 --> 00:37:54.071]  Well, I say that the Apple sign, which we're getting rid of in the company, because it's so fascist working with China now,
[00:37:54.981 --> 00:38:02.544]  I say it's a sign that supports China that kills more people than Hitler ever did, so I say I don't want to see the Apple sign, because to me it's offensive.
[00:38:02.744 --> 00:38:03.684]  But see, that's not going to happen.
[00:38:04.885 --> 00:38:05.905]  Plus, I don't want to get rid of symbols.
[00:38:06.805 --> 00:38:12.527]  They just want to be able to say whatever symbols they want are evil, and remove whatever they want, because they're at war with language.
[00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:18.569]  Because tyranny is something that isn't popular, and people don't want it, so they have to sabotage it.
[00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.011]  Let's go ahead and go back to Joe Biden.
[00:38:24.514 --> 00:38:30.191]  Carrying Nazi flags chanting the same exact anti-Semitic bio.
[00:38:32.768 --> 00:38:51.563]  And I forgot, all three of the leaders worked for Obama within one year, Hillary, and then they all suddenly went from being big university operators with parents of the Democratic Party, some of them intelligence groups, to going out marching around with torches dressed in 1930s outfits so that people think Nazis are invading.
[00:38:51.923 --> 00:38:54.865]  And how many times has the Southern Property Law Center and ADL
[00:38:55.746 --> 00:38:57.427]  And others have been caught posing as Nazis.
[00:38:57.907 --> 00:38:58.808]  How many times?
[00:38:59.008 --> 00:39:02.069]  I got a stack of news where Muslims have been caught in the U.S.
[00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:05.891]  and Canada this week staging attacks on themselves that they did!
[00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:11.413]  Let's go back to Joe Biden.
[00:39:12.534 --> 00:39:15.916]  ...in Berlin and every other German city in the 30s.
[00:39:18.697 --> 00:39:19.637]  It's serious, guys.
[00:39:20.118 --> 00:39:20.638]  So hush up.
[00:39:22.483 --> 00:39:23.724]  This is deadly earnest.
[00:39:23.844 --> 00:39:25.165]  Yes, the Nazis are here.
[00:39:25.185 --> 00:39:27.027]  We are in a fight for America's soul.
[00:39:28.508 --> 00:39:43.000]  And we have leaders, we have leaders who at the time when that occurred, when these guys were accompanied by white supremacists and Ku Klux Klan and those who objected, making a comparison saying they're good people in both groups.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.521]  What has become of us?
[00:39:45.862 --> 00:39:50.967]  Our children are listening and our silence is complicity.
[00:39:53.371 --> 00:39:55.373]  Our silence is complicity.
[00:39:57.775 --> 00:40:10.105]  You know, Trump got a briefing two hours from Charlottesville from Homeland Security, who had agents there, and they said, sir, it was some reporters on both sides, some pro-peace people on one side, Antifa's bad, and then some Nazis on the other side that were bad.
[00:40:10.854 --> 00:40:16.580]  So Trump goes, well the Nazis were bad and so was the Antifa was bad, and there were good people on both sides as well.
[00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:19.403]  That was given to him in the briefing.
[00:40:19.883 --> 00:40:28.372]  You had a bunch of people out there to cover it, a bunch of peace people, a bunch of right-wing pro-free speech people, and then you had some Nazis and some Antifa.
[00:40:28.613 --> 00:40:30.735]  But yeah, I think we all agree are unsavory folks.
[00:40:32.827 --> 00:40:34.249]  That's how this works.
[00:40:34.629 --> 00:40:35.430]  Well, good job of the crew.
[00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.735]  They actually found the photo, remember that, of Trump being briefed on Charlottesville.
[00:40:39.055 --> 00:40:39.856]  He didn't know what it was.
[00:40:39.876 --> 00:40:41.458]  He went and said, what is this?
[00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:43.120]  They said, here it is, sir.
[00:40:44.602 --> 00:40:51.231]  So he went out there, but imagine in America, the Communist Chinese have killed a hundred plus million people.
[00:40:54.571 --> 00:40:56.232]  They've done that for their own people.
[00:40:56.392 --> 00:40:57.412]  Never a word about them.
[00:40:57.712 --> 00:41:01.234]  Never about Apple and slave factories and suicide nets.
[00:41:01.634 --> 00:41:03.555]  Never about Google helping round up political dissidents.
[00:41:03.595 --> 00:41:10.898]  It's all about America and Nazis and Charlottesville and the people with torches.
[00:41:10.998 --> 00:41:18.321]  All 20 of them are coming to get you and you better do what Joe Biden says or the Nazis will get you.
[00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:23.063]  This is how stupid they think you are.
[00:41:25.422 --> 00:41:34.126]  And really, what it was, was the art club from a couple local universities with guys that get Southern Poverty Law Center money.
[00:41:34.146 --> 00:41:35.367]  It's just coming out in court.
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:40.122]  Who just all dress up like Nazis to go scare the hell out of everybody and go after Trump.
[00:41:40.362 --> 00:41:41.103]  That's what the left is.
[00:41:41.123 --> 00:41:42.144]  They're a drama club.
[00:41:42.804 --> 00:41:43.785]  They are thespians.
[00:41:44.225 --> 00:41:44.985]  They are actors.
[00:41:45.065 --> 00:41:46.286]  It's what they do.
[00:41:46.346 --> 00:41:49.928]  It's what they constantly get caught doing and they don't want us to know that.
[00:41:50.328 --> 00:41:56.132]  Anderson Cooper stood in water up to his chest in a ditch to say the houses were flooded when they weren't.
[00:42:00.254 --> 00:42:02.036]  The Weather Channel was being blown all over the place.
[00:42:02.316 --> 00:42:03.456]  People walked calmly behind him.
[00:42:03.496 --> 00:42:04.037]  It was fake.
[00:42:05.003 --> 00:42:06.584]  It's what they do.
[00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:08.044]  They are the fraud.
[00:42:09.625 --> 00:42:12.826]  And they don't want you asking questions.
[00:42:12.866 --> 00:42:14.087]  They don't want you talking about it.
[00:42:14.107 --> 00:42:23.490]  They want to put out their fake info and have you go into suspended disbelief and have you believe that it's all real.
[00:42:24.131 --> 00:42:26.952]  But once somebody's awake to a scam, they never go back.
[00:42:27.232 --> 00:42:28.132]  And that's what they don't get.
[00:42:28.152 --> 00:42:30.313]  There is going to be a big giant red wave.
[00:42:30.953 --> 00:42:34.575]  The question is, will the seawall of the Democratic Party
[00:42:38.672 --> 00:42:53.126]  Will the Democratic Party be able to build a big enough wall to block that seawall with election fraud and the rest of it?
[00:42:54.328 --> 00:42:55.969]  I'm gonna keep fighting to the end regardless.
[00:42:56.029 --> 00:42:57.751]  I don't know if you are, but I sure as hell am.
[00:42:58.091 --> 00:42:58.632]  I'm conscious.
[00:42:58.692 --> 00:42:59.353]  I'm not dead yet.
[00:43:02.634 --> 00:43:06.996]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:43:07.476 --> 00:43:16.401]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:21.503]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[00:43:21.743 --> 00:43:31.988]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[00:43:32.048 --> 00:43:32.548]  We're good to go!
[00:44:06.912 --> 00:44:10.014]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:44:10.034 --> 00:44:10.554]  You're on the air.
[00:44:10.594 --> 00:44:11.735]  Thanks for holding.
[00:44:11.755 --> 00:44:12.615]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:44:12.815 --> 00:44:13.416]  Hey, brother.
[00:44:13.736 --> 00:44:14.076]  Good, man.
[00:44:14.116 --> 00:44:14.916]  Thank you for calling.
[00:44:14.976 --> 00:44:15.557]  Hey, hey.
[00:44:15.637 --> 00:44:20.059]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:44:20.279 --> 00:44:26.643]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:44:26.783 --> 00:44:28.704]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:44:28.724 --> 00:44:35.388]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:44:35.868 --> 00:44:36.989]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:41.051]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:44:41.452 --> 00:44:43.133]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:44:43.513 --> 00:44:44.253]  And exactly.
[00:44:44.273 --> 00:44:48.516]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:44:48.856 --> 00:44:49.137]  Boom!
[00:44:49.277 --> 00:44:52.098]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:44:52.158 --> 00:44:52.699]  It's amazing.
[00:44:52.759 --> 00:44:56.982]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:45:02.586 --> 00:45:06.267]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[00:45:06.547 --> 00:45:09.988]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[00:45:10.328 --> 00:45:19.871]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[00:45:20.371 --> 00:45:23.813]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[00:45:24.153 --> 00:45:29.116]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[00:45:29.176 --> 00:45:31.538]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[00:45:31.818 --> 00:45:36.360]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[00:45:36.441 --> 00:45:37.081]  Ah, you don't want that.
[00:45:37.481 --> 00:45:41.262]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[00:45:41.502 --> 00:45:44.163]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[00:45:44.423 --> 00:45:47.724]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[00:45:48.104 --> 00:45:53.405]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[00:45:53.485 --> 00:45:57.626]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[00:45:58.486 --> 00:46:01.167]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[00:46:02.625 --> 00:46:04.387]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:47:05.653 --> 00:47:08.275]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.871 --> 00:47:31.112]  Alex Jones back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:31.132 --> 00:47:38.294]  I want to get into what's happening right now with the attempt to confer Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
[00:47:54.141 --> 00:47:59.986]  And how they float this whole thing about 35 years ago in high school, he might have jumped on top of a girl at a drunk party.
[00:48:02.108 --> 00:48:04.250]  And now they've got the person going public.
[00:48:08.154 --> 00:48:14.780]  I have personally experienced mainstream media go out and offer people money to lie about me.
[00:48:18.983 --> 00:48:22.125]  And when you see it in print, you know how criminal these gribs are.
[00:48:22.505 --> 00:48:29.968]  And the fact that Democrats believe it's their duty to go out and make things up.
[00:48:30.968 --> 00:48:33.390]  When you see something like this, it doesn't hold any water.
[00:48:36.591 --> 00:48:43.574]  In fact, we're going to get to it here in just a moment, but it's amazing the lengths to which this stuff will happen.
[00:48:43.994 --> 00:48:45.335]  And maybe this woman even believes it.
[00:48:46.527 --> 00:48:48.809]  We're gonna get to that here in just a moment.
[00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:57.396]  But first, it's important to understand that I'm not really worried about me being deplatformed off of 90 plus platforms now.
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:09.307]  I'm concerned because it's concerted and it's corporate, and it's being done to many, many other people in unison.
[00:49:12.129 --> 00:49:14.171]  And by them picking InfoWars out to do it,
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:39.996]  And building a straw man, it distracts from the fact that it is monopolistic, it is racketeering, it is very, very dangerous what's going on by any yardstick, and the addled, tepid, sluggish, sloth-like response by the Republicans is horrifying.
[00:49:42.597 --> 00:49:43.738]  I haven't even gotten to this yet.
[00:49:43.778 --> 00:49:44.779]  We've got screenshots.
[00:49:46.055 --> 00:49:50.077]  And we've got IT people that gave us a report and I'll put it out tomorrow and it's an exclusive.
[00:49:51.277 --> 00:49:57.120]  But we actually had software that we used banned over the weekend.
[00:49:59.681 --> 00:50:01.082]  And I've talked to lawyers about this.
[00:50:01.122 --> 00:50:02.963]  This is definitely illegal.
[00:50:03.603 --> 00:50:05.144]  Definitely racketeering.
[00:50:05.284 --> 00:50:07.565]  I mean, it's it's unbelievable.
[00:50:10.342 --> 00:50:22.990]  And it deals with Apple and, you know, I'll try my best because there's a target fixation that goes on in warfare where you'll get fixated on your target and then not even pay attention to what's happening to you.
[00:50:23.691 --> 00:50:29.514]  The famous case is people flying aircraft, strafing, say a train or a truck, and they'll fly into the vehicle.
[00:50:29.935 --> 00:50:31.996]  They'll just keep and fly into it.
[00:50:33.459 --> 00:51:02.509]  And there's, we've got a great crew here, they're great people, but it's kind of like, I learned about this on Friday, confirmed it with IT, it's the biggest story yet in our censorship, but see, just like the public's supposed to get conditioned to being censored and blacklisted and banned, by InfoWars being in tens of thousands of articles, they're supposed to wear us out psychologically, finally when they start doing stuff like killing the software we use,
[00:51:03.482 --> 00:51:04.563]  It's like, so what?
[00:51:05.183 --> 00:51:06.744]  Everybody knows we're getting banned.
[00:51:07.404 --> 00:51:07.824]  So what?
[00:51:07.844 --> 00:51:09.725]  They took Alex away and killed him too.
[00:51:10.045 --> 00:51:11.206]  You know, we knew it was coming.
[00:51:13.307 --> 00:51:15.568]  And it's just like that globalist told me that time off record.
[00:51:16.269 --> 00:51:19.651]  He's one of the heads of one of the big banks, one of the fourth largest bank at that time.
[00:51:21.772 --> 00:51:25.494]  He said, Alex, you're going to adapt to being a slave.
[00:51:26.094 --> 00:51:27.495]  People don't adapt to fighting it.
[00:51:30.796 --> 00:51:31.697]  He said, you will lose.
[00:51:37.833 --> 00:51:38.373]  And you know what?
[00:51:38.413 --> 00:51:39.154]  Maybe he's right.
[00:51:42.916 --> 00:51:45.477]  And then those of us that don't prey on you, we're the mentally ill ones.
[00:51:49.279 --> 00:51:54.861]  Because what the predators will tell you is, the general public are just failed predators.
[00:51:56.642 --> 00:51:58.703]  And if you help them, they'll just tear you apart.
[00:51:58.743 --> 00:51:59.264]  But you know what?
[00:51:59.664 --> 00:52:01.865]  My soul tells me that's wrong and I'm not going to act like that.
[00:52:06.118 --> 00:52:08.142]  It was very, very frustrating, to say the least.
[00:52:10.245 --> 00:52:16.316]  And... What they're doing to us is so sick.
[00:52:17.438 --> 00:52:18.821]  All of it scientifically directed.
[00:52:25.097 --> 00:52:25.677]  So who knows?
[00:52:26.458 --> 00:52:27.938]  We may never even tell you.
[00:52:28.819 --> 00:52:30.980]  Hell, they might just shut us down and won't even do an article.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.100]  Hell, no one will.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.422]  You know, by the time they actually shut us down, there won't even be a story.
[00:52:37.623 --> 00:52:39.384]  They'd take me out and shoot me in the back of the head.
[00:52:39.424 --> 00:52:41.104]  By then, it's like, that's old news.
[00:52:44.466 --> 00:52:50.929]  They're going into people's phones and killing programs that came with the phones.
[00:52:51.429 --> 00:52:52.950]  So you can't visit Infowars.com.
[00:53:01.715 --> 00:53:02.876]  But everybody's still got their food.
[00:53:02.896 --> 00:53:05.878]  Everybody still can go home and watch television, so who cares?
[00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:06.959]  Exactly.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:08.960]  Exactly.
[00:53:09.841 --> 00:53:10.662]  And that's why we fail.
[00:53:10.702 --> 00:53:11.342]  That's why we die.
[00:53:12.703 --> 00:53:20.569]  And I just watch us being incrementally enslaved, and I'm upset about it, and I'm supposed to see how that works and join it and farm you!
[00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:30.697]  I'm supposed to serve the globalists, so I get life extension technology, and I get cybernetic enhancement down the road,
[00:53:31.687 --> 00:53:33.909]  And I'm supposed to revel in how dumb you are.
[00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:34.810]  See?
[00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:38.113]  But instead, I get to be the bad guy because I'm trying to save you.
[00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:41.556]  Because I have some type of connection to you.
[00:53:49.084 --> 00:53:51.486]  It's, it's, it's beyond amazing.
[00:53:53.348 --> 00:53:55.610]  So people ask, you know, why is your broadcast banned?
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.760]  Why are they trying to ban it?
[00:53:58.541 --> 00:54:03.643]  Because of what we're covering, and because they're going to go ahead and make that move, and because they want to set the precedent.
[00:54:07.104 --> 00:54:07.665]  But I know this.
[00:54:07.725 --> 00:54:13.267]  I look at people that have decided to make these evil decisions, and they are the most unhappy, twisted, physically ugly people on earth.
[00:54:13.587 --> 00:54:18.249]  So let me tell you, metaphysically, culturally, and at a gut level, I know not to join them.
[00:54:19.329 --> 00:54:23.051]  But the public needs to stand up for their own self-preservation.
[00:54:23.391 --> 00:54:25.112]  Now this is funny for radio listeners.
[00:54:26.834 --> 00:54:32.197]  But it's really funny if you're a TV viewer at InfoWars.com forward slash show or on TV stations around the country.
[00:54:32.217 --> 00:54:41.641]  Because this is a piece that Drew and Savannah put together a month and a half ago when our app went to number one on Apple and on Android.
[00:54:42.281 --> 00:54:47.184]  And then after it went to number one, they just removed the Apple one that had two million downloads.
[00:54:47.224 --> 00:54:50.685]  The Android's still there at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:54:52.964 --> 00:55:01.591]  This is us making a joke out of what they did, but we knew the next move would be BlockInfoWars.com at the browser level.
[00:55:03.092 --> 00:55:04.253]  And that is now begun.
[00:55:07.655 --> 00:55:09.477]  And InfoWars will not be the one that breaks it.
[00:55:09.497 --> 00:55:11.478]  I'm going to let the enemy go ahead and do it now.
[00:55:11.518 --> 00:55:12.379]  No one cares around here.
[00:55:12.399 --> 00:55:13.039]  That's fine.
[00:55:13.099 --> 00:55:13.600]  I love it too.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:13.860]  Great.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.661]  Yeah.
[00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:15.581]  Close our doors.
[00:55:20.166 --> 00:55:21.147]  We'll let the enemy break it.
[00:55:21.988 --> 00:55:24.211]  And let's see how they... Oh, it's a private company.
[00:55:24.351 --> 00:55:26.293]  Oh, it's a... Oh, you bought that phone.
[00:55:26.373 --> 00:55:30.057]  So, they're blocking visiting Infowars.com on an Apple phone.
[00:55:30.077 --> 00:55:30.838]  That's what they're doing now.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.584]  And it's cute, and it's fun, and it's neat, and it's great.
[00:55:36.965 --> 00:55:37.926]  And so, here it is.
[00:55:38.747 --> 00:55:39.228]  Here's the quote.
[00:55:44.301 --> 00:55:49.453]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer and TV.
[00:55:49.814 --> 00:55:51.919]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[00:55:53.869 --> 00:56:02.875]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasting radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:03.216 --> 00:56:09.440]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:14.744]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[00:56:15.184 --> 00:56:16.125]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:56:16.525 --> 00:56:18.606]  Not so fast, InfoWars.
[00:56:18.967 --> 00:56:20.367]  Apple banned your rap.
[00:56:23.009 --> 00:56:25.270]  I helped, too!
[00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:26.151]  Oliver!
[00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:29.853]  I hate free speech, too!
[00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:31.394]  We hate free speech!
[00:56:31.494 --> 00:56:34.175]  We hate free speech!
[00:56:34.315 --> 00:56:36.376]  We hate free speech!
[00:56:36.497 --> 00:56:39.578]  We hate free speech!
[00:56:41.419 --> 00:56:42.280]  But I can tell you,
[00:56:43.786 --> 00:56:46.367]  Millions download the app, then they take it out of the store.
[00:56:47.227 --> 00:56:48.147]  Congress does nothing.
[00:56:48.667 --> 00:56:49.688]  Well, that's so illegal.
[00:56:50.468 --> 00:56:52.849]  Next, they're going to go in and take the app off your phone.
[00:56:53.769 --> 00:56:57.590]  Next, they're going to block the InfoWars RSS feeder on Apple, which they've already done.
[00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:58.530]  That's the breaking news.
[00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:00.271]  And just everything else.
[00:57:00.331 --> 00:57:04.492]  And see, by the time they get to the real censorship, the real
[00:57:08.007 --> 00:57:11.490]  Extermination of freedom, it's just laissez-faire law.
[00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:13.932]  Because you've already gotten yourself ready to accept that.
[00:57:15.453 --> 00:57:19.117]  And so see, by the time you've done that, oh, it's like Think Progress is being banned.
[00:57:19.377 --> 00:57:20.918]  Well, okay, that's alright too.
[00:57:21.258 --> 00:57:27.364]  You know, as long as... The good old neocon boys over at the CIA do it.
[00:57:27.604 --> 00:57:30.727]  As long as, you know, because nobody reads the Weekly Standard, everybody hates them.
[00:57:31.327 --> 00:57:32.528]  So what's the power structure do?
[00:57:32.608 --> 00:57:34.510]  Oh, put them in charge of censoring the left.
[00:57:35.615 --> 00:57:38.958]  And the left won't defend the right, the right won't defend the left, and then it's game over.
[00:57:39.878 --> 00:57:41.520]  Well, that's not the truth.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:48.825]  We're winning, big red waves coming, but folks have to really realize we're two minutes to midnight, and now's the time to get on your knees to Jesus.
[00:57:49.126 --> 00:57:50.366]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:57:52.808 --> 00:57:53.309]  Look at that.
[00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:56.031]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[00:57:56.071 --> 00:57:58.373]  That's because it's been teenager, it's been watered down.
[00:57:58.673 --> 00:57:59.413]  We didn't do that.
[00:58:01.071 --> 00:58:05.173]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[00:58:05.593 --> 00:58:07.254]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[00:58:07.834 --> 00:58:16.377]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[00:58:16.857 --> 00:58:18.538]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:19.719]  Don't you get the big secret?
[00:58:20.399 --> 00:58:22.900]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:24.040]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[00:58:24.821 --> 00:58:27.622]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:35.630]  Look it up.
[00:58:36.751 --> 00:58:42.776]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[00:58:42.817 --> 00:58:47.661]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[00:58:48.141 --> 00:58:50.863]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4Store.com.
[00:58:52.495 --> 00:59:00.500]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.

[00:59:49.597 --> 00:59:51.779]  Now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:56.152 --> 01:00:01.035]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:23.192 --> 01:00:27.316]  So, about five months ago, the EU introduced legislation to ban memes.
[01:00:28.697 --> 01:00:29.217]  Seriously.
[01:00:30.338 --> 01:00:33.901]  Because their AI can't scan it, it doesn't get humor, so they can't censor it.
[01:00:34.802 --> 01:00:40.047]  And so they go, oh, it's copyright, it's going to be reviewed by the EU, there's multi-million euro fines.
[01:00:40.667 --> 01:00:41.588]  And then now they passed it.
[01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:44.371]  So first the media said, oh, it'll never happen.
[01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.072]  Now, of course, it's happened.
[01:00:46.733 --> 01:00:47.994]  EU killing legislation.
[01:00:51.552 --> 01:00:53.073]  That is designed to destroy the Internet.
[01:00:53.213 --> 01:00:54.773]  Here is part of the report from John Bowne.
[01:00:55.593 --> 01:01:03.075]  EU Parliament recently put the Internet, at least in Europe, on a path towards certain corporate Orwellian doom.
[01:01:03.315 --> 01:01:10.857]  This discussion is bedeviled by all sorts of artificial media twitstorms and hysteria of one kind or another.
[01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:15.158]  There's a very good argument against the lack of democracy in the EU.
[01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:16.578]  Isn't it funny?
[01:01:16.898 --> 01:01:18.219]  You know, when I came here 17 years ago,
[01:01:20.119 --> 01:01:26.344]  And I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union.
[01:01:27.145 --> 01:01:28.226]  You all laughed at me.
[01:01:29.406 --> 01:01:31.968]  Well, I have to say, you're not laughing now, are you?
[01:01:32.249 --> 01:01:45.579]  The main reason the United Kingdom voted the way that it did is you have, by stealth, by deception, without ever telling the truth to the British or the rest of the peoples of Europe,
[01:01:46.986 --> 01:01:49.908]  You have imposed upon them a political union!
[01:01:51.489 --> 01:02:03.976]  Article 11, also known as the Link Tax, forces anyone linking an article of more than one word to a news story to pay for a service that licenses the article.
[01:02:04.216 --> 01:02:10.260]  That news site can, according to The Verge, charge anything they want for the right to quote them,
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:16.802]  ...or refuse to sell altogether, effectively giving them the right to choose who can criticize them.
[01:02:17.122 --> 01:02:37.067]  While Article 13, also known as the Upload Filter, requires all but the smallest platforms will have to defensively adopt copyright filters that examine everything you post and censor anything judged to be a copyright infringement, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:02:37.347 --> 01:02:49.492]  And if that wasn't enough to bring the free flow of information to a grinding halt, typical social media posts like a selfie taken at a football game have been targeted by Article 12A.
[01:02:49.712 --> 01:02:54.234]  No posting your own photos or videos of sports matches, only the
[01:02:54.534 --> 01:03:00.997]  Organizers of sports matches will have the right to publicly post any kind of record of the match.
[01:03:01.297 --> 01:03:05.499]  No posting your selfies or short videos of exciting plays.
[01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:07.159]  You are the audience.
[01:03:07.419 --> 01:03:09.921]  Your job is to sit where you're told.
[01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:12.962]  Passively watch the game and go home.
[01:03:13.542 --> 01:03:14.943]  According to the EFF.
[01:03:15.264 --> 01:03:19.407]  Also, a freedom of panorama exemption wasn't accepted.
[01:03:19.627 --> 01:03:35.060]  For example, if you take a selfie on a busy street and licensed material happens to be in your shot, whether it's a t-shirt, a licensed architectural design, aka a building, or a billboard, you will be infringing on a copyright.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.341]  Also not covered.
[01:03:36.861 --> 01:03:56.634]  Anything we regard in America as fair use, no user-generated content exemption, which would have made EU states carve out an exception to copyright for using excerpts from works for criticism, review, illustration, caricature, parody, or pastiche.
[01:03:57.035 --> 01:03:59.716]  EU army to increase ranks sevenfold.
[01:04:00.217 --> 01:04:05.901]  I remember 10 years ago saying there's a secret plan for an EU army, because it had actually come out in documents.
[01:04:06.901 --> 01:04:09.522]  We've actually gotten documents from someone inside Bilderberg.
[01:04:09.562 --> 01:04:20.944]  They were discussing an EU army to stop countries from having their own borders and they were going to flood Europe with North Africans and Islamists out of the Middle East.
[01:04:21.965 --> 01:04:22.545]  It's all true.
[01:04:22.765 --> 01:04:23.265]  It all happened.
[01:04:23.305 --> 01:04:24.445]  Of course, it was real documents we got.
[01:04:25.245 --> 01:04:31.447]  Then a guy who works at the National Archives brought me secret Bilderberg documents the next year confirming it all.
[01:04:31.847 --> 01:04:32.687]  We published them all.
[01:04:34.224 --> 01:04:35.144]  I did get death threats.
[01:04:35.484 --> 01:04:42.826]  Now, but Juncker, when you look at the unelected head of the EU that England didn't vote to enter but they're in, the UK, he is the grandson.
[01:04:42.886 --> 01:04:44.526]  His father was a top Nazi.
[01:04:44.886 --> 01:04:47.547]  His grandfather was the richest guy in Germany.
[01:04:47.567 --> 01:04:50.227]  Alright folks, we'll be back.
[01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:53.228]  The full John Bowne report is on Infowars.com.
[01:04:53.408 --> 01:04:54.928]  EU internet killing legislation.
[01:04:54.948 --> 01:04:56.088]  It's really important.
[01:04:56.128 --> 01:04:59.849]  We'll be back with Eric Bolling confronted with 9-11 truths.
[01:04:59.869 --> 01:05:00.329]  Stay with us.
[01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.527]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:05:05.547 --> 01:05:05.967]  Go ahead.
[01:05:06.247 --> 01:05:08.448]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[01:05:08.468 --> 01:05:11.508]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:05:12.329 --> 01:05:13.429]  It just gets old, man.
[01:05:13.749 --> 01:05:15.469]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:05:16.169 --> 01:05:18.250]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:22.510]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:24.991]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:28.111]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:05:28.131 --> 01:05:29.612]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:05:29.852 --> 01:05:30.732]  Us being shut down?
[01:05:30.972 --> 01:05:31.992]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:33.493]  You know what, Alex?
[01:05:33.533 --> 01:05:34.634]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:05:34.894 --> 01:05:35.454]  Hey, Frank!
[01:05:35.715 --> 01:05:41.079]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:05:41.399 --> 01:05:45.682]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:05:45.902 --> 01:05:48.764]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:05:48.784 --> 01:05:49.425]  Do you understand?
[01:05:49.505 --> 01:05:50.786]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:51.146 --> 01:05:52.327]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:53.288 --> 01:05:58.192]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[01:05:59.172 --> 01:05:59.853]  Do you understand?
[01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.054]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:06:23.607 --> 01:06:32.213]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had, formerly with Fox News, Eric Bolling, economist, good friends with Trump, now with CRTV, we had Eric Bolling in studio.
[01:06:33.094 --> 01:06:40.560]  He was going to come on about the economy and about how Trump's ideology is making America great, standing up to big corporate bullies.
[01:06:41.559 --> 01:06:49.207]  Instead of the media saying he has no soul, but Boling wanted to virtue signal to the mainstream media and say, aren't you all right?
[01:06:49.327 --> 01:06:50.128]  They're racist.
[01:06:50.188 --> 01:06:52.170]  And I'm like, that's a Hillary Clinton talking point.
[01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:55.012]  And, oh, you think the government did 9-11?
[01:06:55.093 --> 01:07:00.198]  I'm like, yeah, the 28 pages, criminal elements of our government, allied with Saudi Arabia, stood down.
[01:07:01.186 --> 01:07:02.427]  I've had Senator Paul on.
[01:07:02.447 --> 01:07:04.168]  I've had Congressman Jones on.
[01:07:04.629 --> 01:07:09.432]  I've had former Deputy Directors and former heads of CIOP of the CIA on.
[01:07:10.153 --> 01:07:11.874]  This is a well-known animal.
[01:07:12.554 --> 01:07:14.196]  Doesn't mean radical Islam doesn't exist.
[01:07:16.477 --> 01:07:18.098]  And he just was like, no!
[01:07:19.099 --> 01:07:19.800]  I can't believe it!
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.221]  You know, there were real people down there.
[01:07:21.261 --> 01:07:22.722]  Yeah, we know real people died.
[01:07:23.022 --> 01:07:24.023]  Real planes flew in.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:35.428]  All I'm saying is if you go look at the evidence of Building 7, or of BBC and CNN reporting they were going to blow up Building 7, 47-story building.
[01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.689]  That happened.
[01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:39.150]  Later they said it never happened.
[01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:41.833]  So the point is it needs to be investigated.
[01:07:42.673 --> 01:07:47.177]  And it turns out within days of the event, on three different shows, then
[01:07:49.175 --> 01:07:57.141]  Real estate mogul, now President Trump, said he thought there were bombs in the buildings, and his engineer, who helped build the World Trade Center, thought that.
[01:07:57.482 --> 01:08:00.664]  So, Bolling was here, and I would mention this.
[01:08:00.684 --> 01:08:01.925]  He goes, oh, you don't have the clip.
[01:08:01.965 --> 01:08:03.426]  You know, I don't want to just hear it.
[01:08:04.047 --> 01:08:04.707]  Well, guess what?
[01:08:04.828 --> 01:08:09.131]  Now we have the clips, and here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:11.073]  Here is the report.
[01:08:12.076 --> 01:08:16.240]  I get blamed for every conspiracy theory that some crazy person made up.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.942]  I said I do not agree with you that the U.S.
[01:08:18.982 --> 01:08:23.867]  government, someone inside the government, had knowledge of the terror attack prior to the attack.
[01:08:24.047 --> 01:08:24.427]  Oh really?
[01:08:24.648 --> 01:08:29.512]  All over Twitter yesterday, mainline leftist sites celebrated and said America deserved it.
[01:08:29.792 --> 01:08:33.276]  Reality winner had a top-secret security clearance and was helping ISIS.
[01:08:33.536 --> 01:08:36.799]  There are so many... The average professor at UT down the street
[01:08:37.099 --> 01:08:39.361]  ...loves 9-11 and says America deserved it.
[01:08:39.581 --> 01:08:44.466]  There were elements in our government allied with radical Islam that helped them carry out the attack!
[01:08:44.526 --> 01:08:49.810]  You can argue whether or not America deserved it or not, I don't think.
[01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:51.432]  I don't think America deserved it!
[01:08:51.632 --> 01:08:53.874]  I'm saying the left is cheerleading it!
[01:08:53.954 --> 01:09:02.181]  Your theory, Alex, your theory was not only did America not deserve it, but the United States government knew about the attack prior to the attack and decided to stand down.
[01:09:02.301 --> 01:09:03.142]  A very different theory.
[01:09:03.402 --> 01:09:04.623]  I don't want to spend all our time on 9-11.
[01:09:04.763 --> 01:09:06.365]  It's not that I'm running away from it.
[01:09:06.665 --> 01:09:08.487]  It's that the media misrepresents what I say about it.
[01:09:08.547 --> 01:09:13.211]  I believe Islamic terror and radical Islam is one of the number one threats on the planet, probably number one.
[01:09:13.992 --> 01:09:18.956]  I know that there are criminals in our government, like Brennan, who reportedly converted to Wahhabism.
[01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:23.561]  Obama helped launch the Arab Spring, to overthrow our allies in Egypt, you name it.
[01:09:24.141 --> 01:09:27.044]  And I think that elements let this happen, like PNAC.
[01:09:27.564 --> 01:09:33.789]  wrote to let there be an attack to end up taking our liberties away, and I've got FBI was warned about flight schools.
[01:09:34.469 --> 01:09:35.730]  That's CBS News.
[01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:38.492]  FBI knew Al Qaeda pilots were training in the U.S.
[01:09:38.512 --> 01:09:39.393]  in order to stand down.
[01:09:39.713 --> 01:09:40.373]  ABC News.
[01:09:40.834 --> 01:09:47.358]  The State Department lapses aided 9-11 hijackers, and they have the airlift of evil flying tens of thousands of Al Qaeda fighters out.
[01:09:47.578 --> 01:09:48.679]  Our military was ordered to do it.
[01:09:48.699 --> 01:09:49.740]  I don't blame our military.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.860]  Oh, you hate our military?
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.580]  No, I love our military.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:57.982]  The bin Laden family was whisked out of the United States by President Bush himself right after the 9-11 attack.
[01:09:58.002 --> 01:09:59.922]  And they went back to Saudi Arabia, correct?
[01:09:59.942 --> 01:10:00.562]  That's right.
[01:10:00.742 --> 01:10:11.684]  When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:11.704 --> 01:10:15.085]  All I'm saying is there is a radical Islamic alliance with the left.
[01:10:15.905 --> 01:10:18.866]  And there are people in the government working to protect Islam.
[01:10:19.106 --> 01:10:21.227]  They got this imam that's connected to dozens of bombings.
[01:10:21.287 --> 01:10:25.889]  After six months, he's being released from British prison next week.
[01:10:25.929 --> 01:10:28.409]  You said some things that I agree with.
[01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:32.871]  I believe radical Islam is the greatest threat to the United States, our freedom, maybe even the globe.
[01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:33.731]  I'll agree with that.
[01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:35.092]  Maybe the left's bigger though.
[01:10:35.852 --> 01:10:44.738]  Well, I think the one on the left is a different type of threat and it's a longer-term threat where, you know, radical Islam could, you know, kill a lot of people real fast.
[01:10:45.078 --> 01:10:48.440]  And the left, it's going to take a while for them to take over and take away our liberties and freedoms.
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:51.562]  But I think we can deal with a straight-on attack like radical Islam.
[01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:52.762]  It's the left creeping around.
[01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:53.563]  I don't like them either.
[01:10:54.063 --> 01:10:54.744]  I'm on board with that.
[01:10:55.064 --> 01:10:59.526]  Well, this is video on screen of them saying Building 7 has already fallen.
[01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:00.107]  Have you seen that video?
[01:11:01.892 --> 01:11:02.612]  And it's right behind her.
[01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:03.753]  I can't hear her.
[01:11:03.773 --> 01:11:05.234]  Do you want me to play it for you?
[01:11:05.634 --> 01:11:05.814]  What?
[01:11:06.234 --> 01:11:08.195]  I'd like to hear her say it's already fallen.
[01:11:08.455 --> 01:11:15.179]  And by the way, Alex, anyone could throw a video, a picture behind it as the news person.
[01:11:15.199 --> 01:11:17.540]  That could be... Well, she's saying Building 7 has fallen.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.941]  They put the story out beforehand.
[01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:22.503]  Now, more on the latest building collapse in New York.
[01:11:22.523 --> 01:11:26.925]  You might have heard a few moments ago I was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing.
[01:11:27.425 --> 01:11:28.266]  And indeed it has.
[01:11:28.346 --> 01:11:32.108]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[01:11:32.308 --> 01:11:34.309]  Well, only really what you already know.
[01:11:34.329 --> 01:11:36.130]  The details are very, very sketchy.
[01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:45.475]  We are getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7 in the World Trade Center complex, is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[01:11:45.555 --> 01:11:48.018]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:11:48.578 --> 01:11:50.100]  It just pancaked.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:52.923]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision implosion.
[01:11:53.023 --> 01:11:55.026]  Everybody get away from the tower!
[01:11:55.106 --> 01:11:57.148]  Everybody get away from the tower!
[01:11:57.208 --> 01:12:06.078]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:12:11.463 --> 01:12:21.710]  Donald Trump is on the line, and we know him as the man behind lots of real estate in Manhattan, and of course, Donald, I understand you were actually a witness to what happened this morning.
[01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:28.154]  Well, I have a window that looks directly at the World Trade Center, and I saw this huge explosion.
[01:12:28.234 --> 01:12:31.916]  I was with a group of people, and I really couldn't even believe it.
[01:12:32.637 --> 01:12:37.079]  And even, I think, worse than that, for years I've looked right directly at the building.
[01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.541]  I'd see the Empire State Building in the foreground, and
[01:12:39.969 --> 01:12:44.292]  The World Trade Center in the background, and now I'm looking at absolutely nothing.
[01:12:44.352 --> 01:12:44.872]  It's just gone.
[01:12:44.892 --> 01:12:48.315]  You know, the World Trade Center was always known as a very, very strong building.
[01:12:48.355 --> 01:12:50.316]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[01:12:50.376 --> 01:12:53.158]  Now the basement is the most vulnerable place, because that's your foundation.
[01:12:53.398 --> 01:12:55.720]  This was an unbelievably powerful building.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.243]  If you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside.
[01:13:00.303 --> 01:13:06.807]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows, is that in between all the windows, you had the steel on the outside.
[01:13:06.827 --> 01:13:08.208]  So you had the steel on the outside of the building.
[01:13:08.686 --> 01:13:11.810]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams.
[01:13:12.331 --> 01:13:16.537]  When I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel.
[01:13:17.298 --> 01:13:21.384]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks?
[01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:24.368]  I think you, you know, if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow.
[01:13:25.077 --> 01:13:26.898]  And in between was this heavy steel.
[01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:35.344]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or a 747, or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through the steel?
[01:13:35.885 --> 01:13:44.270]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall.
[01:13:44.651 --> 01:13:48.113]  Most buildings are built with the steelers on the inside around the elevator shaft.
[01:13:48.654 --> 01:13:51.996]  This one was built from the outside, which is the strongest structure you can have.
[01:13:52.759 --> 01:13:54.741]  So I said the exact same things back in the time.
[01:14:17.466 --> 01:14:19.388]  It was on local news there were bombs in the buildings.
[01:14:20.268 --> 01:14:23.912]  And then the media would say, Jones says the fire department blew it up.
[01:14:25.193 --> 01:14:26.954]  Or Jones says the military did.
[01:14:27.134 --> 01:14:28.536]  Never said that.
[01:14:29.396 --> 01:14:32.099]  I said, I saw the news.
[01:14:32.439 --> 01:14:33.260]  I heard the news.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:34.821]  They said they blew it up.
[01:14:36.523 --> 01:14:42.128]  And then you had John O'Neill, the deputy head of the FBI, quit a month before 9-11.
[01:14:45.043 --> 01:14:47.684]  And he came out and said, we're going to let Al-Qaeda attack us.
[01:14:48.465 --> 01:14:49.946]  Al-Qaeda has infiltrated our government.
[01:14:51.626 --> 01:14:53.507]  And it's wrong what happened and we need to expose it.
[01:14:53.527 --> 01:14:54.428]  And then he died.
[01:14:54.748 --> 01:14:57.970]  His first day at work was 9-11 as the head of security at the World Trade Center.
[01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:01.312]  And I've got the footage of the local police saying, get back.
[01:15:01.812 --> 01:15:02.692]  They're going to blow it up.
[01:15:02.852 --> 01:15:03.953]  Doesn't mean the police are involved.
[01:15:04.513 --> 01:15:06.995]  I talked to cops that were there during the 10-second countdown.
[01:15:07.435 --> 01:15:08.215]  But I don't just have that.
[01:15:08.355 --> 01:15:13.038]  I found the cops who were on PBS getting the countdown for Building 7.
[01:15:14.312 --> 01:15:15.453]  And they blew up other buildings, too.
[01:15:16.373 --> 01:15:18.534]  And all the chaos, they're told, oh, we're gonna protect these buildings.
[01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:21.596]  It takes days, if not weeks, to wire these buildings.
[01:15:21.936 --> 01:15:22.717]  Do I know what happened?
[01:15:22.857 --> 01:15:23.557]  No, I don't.
[01:15:24.718 --> 01:15:25.918]  Just like President Trump doesn't.
[01:15:26.719 --> 01:15:27.599]  I covered it.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:28.720]  I was on air.
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:30.521]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[01:15:30.881 --> 01:15:32.722]  Now, Eric Bolling said, hey, show me the clips.
[01:15:33.222 --> 01:15:34.323]  Eric, we just showed you the clips.
[01:15:35.144 --> 01:15:38.285]  So, this is a live show, but later we'll cut this out, we'll archive it.

[01:18:06.859 --> 01:18:12.460]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:18:12.661 --> 01:18:13.741]  I'd done The War Room.
[01:18:14.041 --> 01:18:16.502]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:18:16.522 --> 01:18:18.082]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:18:18.122 --> 01:18:18.802]  I was exhausted.
[01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:22.363]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[01:18:22.683 --> 01:18:27.304]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[01:18:27.404 --> 01:18:29.385]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:18:29.665 --> 01:18:30.265]  The same thing.
[01:18:30.346 --> 01:18:32.247]  I'm going to put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[01:18:32.347 --> 01:18:33.568]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.

[01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:57.944]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found, and I've tried them all.
[01:18:58.304 --> 01:18:59.565]  I wasted a lot of money at Whole Foods.

[01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:23.850]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store...
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:44.681]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[01:19:45.002 --> 01:19:48.003]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[01:19:48.023 --> 01:19:49.864]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[01:19:49.884 --> 01:19:51.064]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:51.084 --> 01:19:52.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.707 --> 01:20:18.870]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:24.536]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:27.779 --> 01:20:31.482]  All right, Roger Stone riding shotgun with his former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:20:32.303 --> 01:20:33.964]  Mueller sharks circling him.
[01:20:34.785 --> 01:20:40.429]  Manafort agreeing to plea bargain, but not on Russiagate, on tax evasion 15 years ago.
[01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:43.892]  But everybody is ready to blow their brains out of the air about Russiagate.
[01:20:44.312 --> 01:20:52.138]  The reason Roger's here is to get into Matt Drudge, who's got a smart political brain on his shoulders, warns of midterm bloodbath.
[01:20:53.059 --> 01:20:56.722]  Trump to lose 60 seats in the House like Obama did unless
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.601]  But he cryptically didn't say what UNLESS meant.
[01:21:01.801 --> 01:21:19.166]  And then, California professor, writer of controversial Brett Kavanaugh letter, speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault, never told anybody until 2012, and she just said a group of frat boys were drunk and jumped on top of me for a few seconds, in a bed.
[01:21:19.186 --> 01:21:27.149]  I think a group of frat boys beat me up a couple times, but I just, he actually was Brett, in fact, I'm not a secret source, Brett Kavanaugh,
[01:21:28.821 --> 01:21:33.683]  In 1986, came to Dallas, Texas, and I was in high school, and he raped me.
[01:21:34.583 --> 01:21:35.163]  No, I'm serious.
[01:21:36.163 --> 01:21:40.325]  He came in the room, it was him, and he punched me right in the nose, and he raped me.
[01:21:41.585 --> 01:21:42.165]  And that's it!
[01:21:42.385 --> 01:21:43.546]  He can't be confirmed.
[01:21:43.606 --> 01:21:50.168]  In fact, he then opened up a black suitcase, and 14 Keebler elves came out.
[01:21:50.888 --> 01:21:52.528]  You're thinking, hey, they're not scary, they're little.
[01:21:52.748 --> 01:21:53.029]  Listen.
[01:21:54.829 --> 01:21:55.549]  They were dangerous.
[01:21:55.589 --> 01:21:57.510]  They tied me down like Lilliputians.
[01:21:58.717 --> 01:21:59.657]  And Gulliver's Travels.
[01:22:00.678 --> 01:22:04.799]  And they, they made me take DMT and PCP.
[01:22:05.979 --> 01:22:12.621]  And then, once I was doing that, Barack Obama flew in, like a little winged pig, and landed at the foot of my bed.
[01:22:13.181 --> 01:22:15.602]  No, I'm being sarcastic here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:16.982 --> 01:22:24.324]  I could say, secret source says that Hillary Clinton
[01:22:26.055 --> 01:22:27.717]  Tells the truth, and you know it was a lie.
[01:22:27.937 --> 01:22:30.140]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:32.422]  At least Anita Hill worked for Clarence Thomas.
[01:22:34.424 --> 01:22:37.007]  But then all the witnesses of her throwing herself at him.
[01:22:38.449 --> 01:22:39.350]  And then it never happened.
[01:22:40.771 --> 01:22:43.674]  So, we're gonna get into that with Roger before we end this segment.
[01:22:44.651 --> 01:22:45.011]  As well.
[01:22:45.051 --> 01:22:53.017]  But Roger, the big enchilada first, Joe Biden, maybe we should queue up the first 20 seconds of that club, says that Trump supporters are the dregs of society.
[01:22:53.337 --> 01:22:57.980]  So if deplorables hurt Hillary, this has got to hurt Joe Biden.
[01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:04.462]  Yeah, I mean, Joe Biden is the world's class example of elitism.
[01:23:04.542 --> 01:23:12.091]  He lives in Greenville, Delaware, the wealthiest part of town, and he tries to pass himself off as just good old regular Joe.
[01:23:12.111 --> 01:23:19.200]  You know, this is a guy whose son, Hunter, got extraordinarily lucrative
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:30.023]  Business deals out of both Ukraine and China in the immediate aftermath of his visiting both countries with his vice presidential father.
[01:23:30.363 --> 01:23:32.164]  You want to talk about collusion?
[01:23:32.784 --> 01:23:37.425]  I mean, Joe Biden is is about as tone deaf as you can get.
[01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:41.026]  And this constant disparagement
[01:23:41.756 --> 01:23:56.189]  of Donald Trump supporters because they're working class people, because they didn't go to Harvard or Yale, is really part and parcel of the elitism of the Democratic Party and people like Biden.
[01:23:56.749 --> 01:24:02.294]  More importantly, though, why he can't keep his hands off of children, I just don't understand.
[01:24:02.314 --> 01:24:06.117]  Well, there's hours of video, but that doesn't matter because Brett Kavanaugh raped me.
[01:24:06.998 --> 01:24:08.179]  Seriously, I'm going to put the headline out.
[01:24:08.199 --> 01:24:09.060]  Did you know he raped me?
[01:24:10.063 --> 01:24:15.486]  This whole thing, this is a woman looking for her Anita Hill moment.
[01:24:16.586 --> 01:24:18.947]  You know, this is her 15 minutes.
[01:24:19.708 --> 01:24:23.289]  Joe Biden is really one creepy guy.
[01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:32.694]  It's interesting because when I was in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware last week, Joe trawls up and down Rehoboth Avenue looking for adoration.
[01:24:33.094 --> 01:24:34.815]  He wants people to adore him.
[01:24:34.895 --> 01:24:39.197]  He has in the back of his mind that he's a Kennedy, whereas in truth,
[01:24:39.857 --> 01:24:47.998]  Every single foreign policy issue he dealt with as chairman of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee, he was wrong.
[01:24:48.239 --> 01:24:49.439]  No, no, he did a terrible job.
[01:24:49.459 --> 01:25:01.441]  But just getting back to this liberal professor had said that once at a party in high school, some drunk guys jumped on her for five seconds and then that was it.
[01:25:02.101 --> 01:25:03.821]  And then now she says it's Kavanaugh.
[01:25:04.161 --> 01:25:05.101]  Well, I want to be clear.
[01:25:07.022 --> 01:25:07.982]  Kavanaugh raped me.
[01:25:10.009 --> 01:25:11.070]  It's about as credible.
[01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:14.371]  I mean, first of all, what evidence does this woman produce?
[01:25:14.431 --> 01:25:18.513]  Is there another witness to this alleged assault?
[01:25:18.914 --> 01:25:28.198]  This is a last-ditch desperation attempt to derail what is almost certainly going to be another conservative Supreme Court justice racked up by Donald Jacobs.
[01:25:28.218 --> 01:25:35.242]  I was about to say, I mean, this is the most classic thing ever, where you just get any leftist out of millions of people just to make something up.
[01:25:36.549 --> 01:25:40.752]  And then to get your husband to say, oh yeah, she told me about it six years ago and then it's a done deal.
[01:25:41.052 --> 01:25:41.793]  This is crazy.
[01:25:42.874 --> 01:25:47.457]  Well, and the performance of Cory Booker really takes the cake.
[01:25:47.537 --> 01:25:48.257]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:25:48.758 --> 01:25:51.740]  I was working on a book on Cory Booker called The Moth.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:03.687]  That's a name given to him by Governor Chris Christie because, like a moth, he flies to every controversy with a press release, but he never actually does anything.
[01:26:04.248 --> 01:26:12.573]  Cory Booker is an incredibly corrupt public servant, and I have a book coming out shortly on Cory Booker that will expose all of that.
[01:26:13.094 --> 01:26:19.518]  I was ready to leave him alone because he's a non-entity and he's not going to be president, but now I think I have no choice.
[01:26:19.898 --> 01:26:21.619]  Well, let's get to that last point, though.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:25.002]  What do you make of Drudge saying we could lose 60 seats?
[01:26:25.443 --> 01:26:34.310]  Well, just because the polls showed Obama at the same point two years in as Trump, those are fake polls, plus there's the Trump secret that a lot of folks don't want to admit they support Trump.
[01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:36.972]  Now they have the illegal and the dead people voting.
[01:26:36.992 --> 01:26:37.733]  That's their secret.
[01:26:38.093 --> 01:26:41.316]  So that's why we still have a chance of losing, but only because of election fraud.
[01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:45.059]  Well, I've got to tell you, Alex, I'm more with
[01:26:45.743 --> 01:26:50.528]  With Matt Drudge on this, including, importantly, the word unless.
[01:26:50.948 --> 01:26:54.312]  The President has not framed this election.
[01:26:54.712 --> 01:26:59.317]  He's too busy dickering with the New York Times over their phony anonymous op-ed.
[01:26:59.697 --> 01:27:01.999]  He's too busy fighting over... No, I agree.
[01:27:02.039 --> 01:27:04.262]  He needs to stop giving their distractions attention.
[01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:05.263]  So what is the unless?
[01:27:05.643 --> 01:27:07.245]  What does President Trump need to do
[01:27:07.905 --> 01:27:10.008]  Right now he needs to say they're trying to overturn the election.
[01:27:10.028 --> 01:27:11.190]  They're trying to kill the recovery.
[01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:13.252]  They're the ones in league with the Russians and others.
[01:27:13.293 --> 01:27:14.674]  They're allied with radical Islam.
[01:27:15.375 --> 01:27:16.217]  They're the frauds.
[01:27:16.237 --> 01:27:19.601]  He needs to get on the super offense and stir Republicans up and do the same.
[01:27:19.922 --> 01:27:20.082]  Right?
[01:27:21.226 --> 01:27:26.711]  Declassify all of the information pertaining to the FISA warrant.
[01:27:27.031 --> 01:27:33.777]  The way to counter the phony Russian collusion fraud is to show who was cheating in 2016.
[01:27:33.917 --> 01:27:36.459]  It wasn't Donald Trump and the Republicans.
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:40.743]  It was Hillary Clinton and the Obama Justice Department and FBI.
[01:27:40.823 --> 01:27:48.330]  Mr. President, we implore you, declassify the information pertaining to the FISA warrants.
[01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:54.692]  When your advisors say, we can't do that sir, it's a matter of national security, that's a lie.
[01:27:54.712 --> 01:27:56.533]  A damnable lie.
[01:27:56.553 --> 01:28:03.476]  Well the matter of national security is not letting this rogue group of angry Democrats overturn the election of the American people and kill our recovery.
[01:28:03.756 --> 01:28:06.017]  He's got to release it now, they're not going to stop.
[01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:07.094]  Right.
[01:28:07.154 --> 01:28:08.495]  Two messages for the election.
[01:28:08.695 --> 01:28:11.676]  One, talk about the economic recovery and how great it is.
[01:28:11.976 --> 01:28:16.038]  Because the mainstream media will not talk about that, even though I think people are feeling it.
[01:28:16.418 --> 01:28:26.041]  And two, get the Democrats on defense by declassifying all of the information pertaining to the spying on Donald Trump's campaign.
[01:28:26.402 --> 01:28:28.883]  Yeah, he says he won't fire Sessions until after the election.
[01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:29.603]  I think that's a mistake.
[01:28:30.745 --> 01:28:32.806]  Well, I agree, but we're probably past that now.
[01:28:32.886 --> 01:28:41.552]  So, tout the economy and declassify the spying information and you will change the whole scope of this election.
[01:28:41.632 --> 01:28:43.593]  And the other unless is this, Roger.
[01:28:44.453 --> 01:28:45.814]  All of us gotta get people to vote.
[01:28:45.874 --> 01:28:47.035]  We gotta be politically active.
[01:28:47.095 --> 01:28:56.961]  We can't be asleep thinking this thing is won because they got a bunch of dead people and a bunch of illegal aliens set to vote and major election fraud with half the machines owned by George Soros.
[01:28:57.321 --> 01:28:58.422]  Newswars.com.
[01:28:58.502 --> 01:28:59.462]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:28:59.522 --> 01:29:00.283]  Roger takes over.
[01:29:02.145 --> 01:29:10.451]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:29:11.411 --> 01:29:15.414]  You know, there's two different types of monarch butterflies.
[01:29:16.630 --> 01:29:31.439]  There's one type that takes several generations to get all the way up to Canada, and then they've got a big one that's three times bigger than the other little monarchs that flies all the way back down to Mexico, one little mountain region, and then they fly all the way back up.
[01:29:31.599 --> 01:29:33.000]  They fly down and have their babies die.
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:33.761]  We're good to go.
[01:29:49.344 --> 01:29:52.566]  We've got to fly all the way from Canada, all the way down to central Mexico.
[01:29:52.706 --> 01:29:54.207]  This big, beautiful forest region.
[01:29:54.267 --> 01:29:56.068]  These big, giant, 500-foot-tall trees.
[01:29:56.249 --> 01:29:58.610]  And a lot of them drop out of the sky and die on their way.
[01:29:58.710 --> 01:29:59.391]  They fall out of the sky.
[01:29:59.411 --> 01:30:02.152]  I've been in Texas, and all of a sudden, big old monarchs start dropping out of the sky.
[01:30:02.252 --> 01:30:04.414]  I saw the documentary, and I was like, I saw that one time when I was a kid.
[01:30:04.514 --> 01:30:05.054]  They didn't make it.
[01:30:05.174 --> 01:30:06.255]  But some of them do make it.
[01:30:06.335 --> 01:30:08.897]  And they make it, and they mate, and they have babies, and they die.
[01:30:08.957 --> 01:30:15.881]  And then it takes those little babies, three generations, in less than a year, living their life cycle, to jump to the north.
[01:30:16.021 --> 01:30:18.663]  And then the big guy pops, and the big guy's got to come back down.
[01:30:18.783 --> 01:30:19.764]  And that's what this is right now.
[01:30:19.784 --> 01:30:20.745]  We're in that period.
[01:30:20.985 --> 01:30:21.906]  You're the big monarch.
[01:30:21.926 --> 01:30:22.807]  You're the big butterfly.
[01:30:23.347 --> 01:30:24.568]  You've got to take it all the way down.
[01:30:24.888 --> 01:30:26.990]  You've got to deliver it or the species dies.
[01:30:27.411 --> 01:30:29.012]  You can't drop the ball at this level.
[01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:30.754]  We're at that in-game time.
[01:30:30.874 --> 01:30:32.815]  And the enemy knows we're turning the tide right now.
[01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:33.796]  They know we're turning the tide.
[01:30:33.836 --> 01:30:38.160]  They can feel our spirit rising and scaring them because it's what they want but what they don't have.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.701]  We already have all the innate power.
[01:30:39.761 --> 01:30:40.862]  We already have all of it.
[01:30:40.942 --> 01:30:41.643]  Keys of the universe.
[01:30:41.703 --> 01:30:42.584]  God already gave them to us.
[01:30:42.724 --> 01:30:43.825]  But we have to learn how to drive first.
[01:30:43.865 --> 01:30:44.746]  This is driver's ed.
[01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:45.927]  God's just waiting right there.
[01:30:46.127 --> 01:30:47.028]  Pass the driving test.
[01:30:47.048 --> 01:30:48.689]  There's a big blue highway right there, baby.
[01:30:48.789 --> 01:30:49.190]  Come on up.
[01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:50.191]  Just like Stranglehold.
[01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.692]  Come on, come on up.
[01:30:51.812 --> 01:30:53.734]  Come on, come on, come on up.
[01:30:53.814 --> 01:30:55.755]  Come on, come on, come on!
[01:30:56.176 --> 01:30:57.217]  They want to keep you down.
[01:30:57.557 --> 01:30:58.518]  Oh, America's bad.
[01:30:58.558 --> 01:30:59.419]  America will never come back.
[01:30:59.439 --> 01:31:00.219]  America sucks.
[01:31:00.239 --> 01:31:00.860]  America's weak.
[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:01.360]  You suck.
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:02.041]  You're nobody.
[01:31:02.421 --> 01:31:03.242]  No, no, no.
[01:31:03.302 --> 01:31:04.123]  You're a victim group.
[01:31:04.143 --> 01:31:05.124]  You're under our control.
[01:31:05.424 --> 01:31:06.865]  You just stay right there where you are.
[01:31:06.885 --> 01:31:08.607]  Oh, Alex Jones is a failure.
[01:31:08.747 --> 01:31:09.588]  Oh, you're a failure.
[01:31:09.728 --> 01:31:10.869]  Oh, Trump's a failure.
[01:31:12.819 --> 01:31:13.960]  That'll give you a little fluoride.
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:14.981]  How about some mercury?
[01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:17.543]  How about we brain damage you so we can lure it over you?
[01:31:17.743 --> 01:31:23.848]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[01:31:23.928 --> 01:31:32.855]  Nobody's got stuff at this level, just like our info, but you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[01:31:32.955 --> 01:31:34.957]  There's no organization more focused, more crazed.
[01:31:35.257 --> 01:31:35.698]  This is it.
[01:31:36.138 --> 01:31:38.079]  We've got products that help you.
[01:31:38.199 --> 01:31:38.700]  Help the brain.
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:39.200]  Help the body.
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:39.680]  Help the heart.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:40.461]  Help the Infowar.
[01:31:40.501 --> 01:31:41.302]  Win, win, win, win, win, win.
[01:31:41.402 --> 01:31:42.282]  Non-zero-sum game.
[01:31:42.382 --> 01:31:43.423]  Planetary expansion.
[01:31:43.483 --> 01:31:44.344]  Everything I do is about that.
[01:31:44.464 --> 01:31:47.926]  And so, victory is very close within our grasp right now.
[01:31:47.946 --> 01:31:48.947]  Now, let me stop right there.
[01:31:49.027 --> 01:31:53.610]  If you don't fund us, they'll have fun destroying me earlier than I think I'm supposed to be.
[01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:55.211]  Just remember, they say I'm failing.
[01:31:55.231 --> 01:31:56.252]  They say I'm going under.
[01:31:56.452 --> 01:31:58.894]  It's not true, but if you don't support us, we will.
[01:31:58.974 --> 01:32:00.195]  Right now at InfowarStore.com.
[01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:10.391]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:32:10.411 --> 01:32:10.932]  You're on the air.
[01:32:10.952 --> 01:32:11.492]  Thanks for holding.
[01:32:11.892 --> 01:32:12.953]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:32:13.193 --> 01:32:13.813]  Hey, brother.
[01:32:14.093 --> 01:32:14.453]  Good, man.
[01:32:14.473 --> 01:32:15.294]  Thank you for calling.
[01:32:15.354 --> 01:32:15.914]  Hey, hey.
[01:32:16.014 --> 01:32:20.436]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:32:20.656 --> 01:32:26.999]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Phylum Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:32:27.019 --> 01:32:28.840]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:35.103]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:32:36.243 --> 01:32:37.364]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:32:37.424 --> 01:32:41.426]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:32:41.827 --> 01:32:43.528]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:32:43.868 --> 01:32:44.628]  And exactly.
[01:32:44.648 --> 01:32:48.871]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:49.512]  Boom!
[01:32:49.652 --> 01:32:52.473]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:32:52.533 --> 01:32:53.054]  It's amazing.
[01:32:53.114 --> 01:32:57.357]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:33:05.948 --> 01:33:17.398]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.039 --> 01:33:27.627]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[01:33:28.168 --> 01:33:29.829]  It's Roger Stone.
[01:33:32.482 --> 01:33:33.303]  Welcome back.
[01:33:33.803 --> 01:33:38.949]  You're on the Alex Jones Show and our very special Sunday night broadcast.
[01:33:39.509 --> 01:33:47.498]  With so much news breaking in Washington, these late evening reports from InfoWars are really indispensable.
[01:33:48.439 --> 01:33:53.625]  But people need to understand that InfoWars is threatened as never before.
[01:33:54.309 --> 01:34:02.314]  There's a veritable war of censorship being waged against Alex Jones and the entire team here at InfoWars.
[01:34:02.775 --> 01:34:08.158]  You see, this is the precursor to an effort to take Donald Trump down.
[01:34:08.759 --> 01:34:20.947]  We saw the seeds of it in the phony but serious New York Times editorial where they talked about a 25th Amendment play to remove the president.
[01:34:21.650 --> 01:34:28.013]  If you've been following InfoWars, you know that we've been reporting about this literally for eight months.
[01:34:28.713 --> 01:34:42.720]  The 25th Amendment is a constitutional amendment that requires that if the vice president and a majority of the president's chosen cabinet seek to remove him, well, he has two choices.
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:48.643]  He can then go quietly, or he can appeal that decision to the U.S.
[01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:53.325]  House of Representatives, currently under control of Paul Ryan.
[01:34:54.026 --> 01:35:00.509]  The point, of course, is that we at InfoWars are bringing you this story, and no one else is.
[01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:06.452]  That's why we need your loyal support at the InfoWars.com store right now.
[01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:12.114]  One of my very favorite products is on sale, and that's X2.
[01:35:12.514 --> 01:35:18.539]  This is the best natural iodine formula that you can buy.
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:32.931]  Now, there's a big difference between Survival Shield X2 and the other iodine products that you can buy at, say, Whole Foods or even CVS or Fresh Market, and that is this.
[01:35:33.571 --> 01:35:43.501]  Alex Jones goes to enormous lengths and expense to get the very best natural nascent iodine on the face of the planet.
[01:35:44.222 --> 01:35:46.865]  And we have a more gentle price.
[01:35:47.505 --> 01:35:48.606]  What was normally $39.95 is $29.95.
[01:35:48.666 --> 01:35:49.567]  I was in Whole Foods yesterday.
[01:35:49.607 --> 01:35:50.068]  You'll pay $42.
[01:35:56.654 --> 01:36:05.478]  For their inferior iodine product, and volume-wise, you actually get more by buying at Infowars.
[01:36:05.859 --> 01:36:18.725]  Nascent iodine is absolutely necessary to torque up your defenses, your immune system, has been used all the way back to the Egyptians for this purpose.
[01:36:19.185 --> 01:36:34.314]  So, by going to the Infowars.com site now and taking advantage of this particular product, and when teamed with other great products, stacking as we call it, it's a 360 win!
[01:36:34.875 --> 01:36:43.480]  You're getting, in the BioTrue Selenium Survival Shield Survival Pack, not only the best nascent iodine and selenium,
[01:36:44.767 --> 01:36:59.058]  Together, which help for healthy thyroid and overall beneficial to your well-being and health, we are helping us fund the fight against the globalist censors who would shut us down.
[01:37:00.039 --> 01:37:07.984]  People don't understand the enormous expense of these harassment lawsuits that have been filed against Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:37:09.366 --> 01:37:12.548]  Oh, Alex Jones says nobody died at Sandy Hook.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.181]  No, he didn't.
[01:37:14.341 --> 01:37:15.722]  That's not what he said.
[01:37:15.742 --> 01:37:19.987]  And anybody who could look at the actual broadcast would know that.
[01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:29.856]  But lo and behold, the tech left, the Facebooks, the Twitters, the YouTubes, they've removed them so they can't even be examined.
[01:37:30.157 --> 01:37:35.522]  Which means Alex Jones is not afforded the opportunity to defend himself with truth.
[01:37:36.573 --> 01:37:41.858]  That's why we need you to go now to the InfoWars.com site and give us your support.
[01:37:42.259 --> 01:37:43.320]  We're not crying wolf.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.484]  We're not just churning to sell product.
[01:37:47.924 --> 01:37:50.607]  We are up against it as never before.
[01:37:51.027 --> 01:37:53.810]  While you're there, two products I highly recommend.
[01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:58.114]  One, Brain Force Plus, one of my personal favorites.
[01:37:58.614 --> 01:37:59.775]  I'm special now for $29.95.
[01:38:00.675 --> 01:38:03.196]  That's a $10 reduction.
[01:38:03.616 --> 01:38:06.577]  Almost 6,000 satisfied testimonials.
[01:38:07.057 --> 01:38:09.578]  I popped a couple of these an hour ago.
[01:38:09.838 --> 01:38:20.662]  That's why I can do this show while working all day trying to finalize what will be an exciting product available on the InfoWars.com store shortly.
[01:38:20.682 --> 01:38:21.962]  Let me talk about that.
[01:38:22.822 --> 01:38:26.965]  Donald Trump has had an incoming assault from Bob Woodward.
[01:38:27.565 --> 01:38:32.989]  Now, if you believe the mainstream media, Bob Woodward is the second coming of Christ.
[01:38:33.309 --> 01:38:34.930]  This man never makes a mistake.
[01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:37.131]  He's a crusading journalist.
[01:38:37.492 --> 01:38:43.716]  He is the voice of reason and truth along with his Sancho Panza, Karl Bernstein.
[01:38:44.296 --> 01:38:47.320]  This is the dynamic duo of duplicity.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:58.492]  In my book, along with Tyler Nixon, Woodward and Bernstein, the godfathers of fake news, breaks down their long history of lies and fraud.
[01:38:59.224 --> 01:38:59.764]  That's right.
[01:38:59.904 --> 01:39:06.068]  This book will be available on the Infowars.com store and elsewhere in the next 24 hours.
[01:39:06.409 --> 01:39:09.210]  We've kept it under wraps, but this I can tell you.
[01:39:09.711 --> 01:39:11.992]  Woodward lies about Watergate.
[01:39:12.472 --> 01:39:19.417]  Woodward lies about his personal background as a naval intelligence briefer for the Nixon White House.
[01:39:19.857 --> 01:39:20.577]  Who says so?
[01:39:20.978 --> 01:39:24.520]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Thomas Moore.
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:26.281]  Who else says so?
[01:39:26.541 --> 01:39:29.883]  The Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird.
[01:39:30.283 --> 01:39:31.244]  But it gets worse.
[01:39:31.604 --> 01:39:52.037]  Woodward lied about Iran-Contra, claiming that he surreptitiously slipped into the hospital room of former CIA Director Bill Casey after Casey had been felled by a stroke, and that Casey confessed everything, and that Casey spoke of his disdain for Ronald Reagan.
[01:39:52.818 --> 01:39:53.538]  I knew Bill Casey.
[01:39:57.961 --> 01:39:58.621]  We're good to go.
[01:40:17.635 --> 01:40:29.843]  And therefore, it was impossible for Casey to tell Woodward this alleged exclusive interview in which he confessed all of Iran-Contra.
[01:40:30.363 --> 01:40:34.065]  And then there's the John Belushi controversy.
[01:40:34.586 --> 01:40:38.088]  Woodward wrote a book about the beloved comedian John Belushi.
[01:40:38.875 --> 01:40:56.535]  My favorite part of our upcoming book is when Al Franken, yes, that Al Franken, sees that Bob Woodward is in Saturday Night Live producer Michael Lorne's, Lorne Michaels' office, digging on dirt on John Belushi.
[01:40:57.222 --> 01:41:05.847]  Franken strolls in and says to both of them, yeah, the only time I ever saw Belushi snorting coke, he's with Carl Bernstein.
[01:41:06.487 --> 01:41:13.691]  That's the kind of truth you're going to get from our new book, Woodward and Bernstein, The Godfathers of Fake News.
[01:41:13.811 --> 01:41:15.512]  And there's so much more.
[01:41:16.032 --> 01:41:22.176]  Numerous members of the Washington Post staff saying there was no deep throat.
[01:41:22.416 --> 01:41:26.338]  It's a confection, a fraud, a made up source.
[01:41:26.978 --> 01:41:37.527]  So, the establishment icons, Woodward and Bernstein, are about to be, shall I say, exposed.
[01:41:37.887 --> 01:41:40.869]  And you'll get it first here at InfoWars.
[01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:56.182]  In the meantime, to make sure that we can continue expanding, continue fighting, continue our fight for truth and to expose not only the truth about 9-11, but the truth about the assault on Donald Trump.
[01:41:56.662 --> 01:41:59.564]  For which they are trying so desperately to censor us.
[01:41:59.985 --> 01:42:02.287]  Go to the Infowars.com store now.
[01:42:02.807 --> 01:42:13.015]  Pick up one of my favorite products, Stone's Rules, my new book, which is the guideline, the field manual for victory against the left.
[01:42:13.496 --> 01:42:17.379]  Yes, every rule you need to know is in there for success.
[01:42:17.759 --> 01:42:20.121]  Whether you choose business, politics,
[01:42:20.777 --> 01:42:24.138]  Tech, fashion, agriculture, it doesn't matter.
[01:42:24.538 --> 01:42:26.878]  These are the rules for success.
[01:42:27.398 --> 01:42:33.259]  And there's a very, very good price for the book if you buy it at the Infowars.com store now.
[01:42:33.679 --> 01:42:42.301]  So help us, help yourself, help Alex Jones in the fight against censorship, because they just keep coming.

[01:46:55.751 --> 01:46:57.573]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.064 --> 01:47:21.966]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:22.426 --> 01:47:26.348]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:26.928 --> 01:47:30.210]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[01:47:32.991 --> 01:47:33.752]  Welcome back.
[01:47:34.572 --> 01:47:40.775]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your host, Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[01:47:41.801 --> 01:47:51.649]  In the last segment, we talked about Bob Woodward and his partner Carl Bernstein, but our focus was on the lies of Woodward.
[01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:56.873]  Lying about Watergate, lying about Deep Throat, who doesn't really exist,
[01:47:57.413 --> 01:48:17.357]  Other than as a composite of sources lying about Iran-Contra, lying about President Ronald Reagan, lying about former CIA Director Bill Casey, the last real patriot to hold that job, lying about the comedian John Belushi, and now lying about President Donald Trump.
[01:48:18.041 --> 01:48:20.923]  But what of his partner, Carl Bernstein?
[01:48:21.043 --> 01:48:24.906]  Well, Carl Bernstein stepped in it only last week.
[01:48:25.446 --> 01:48:47.961]  You see, Bernstein went forward with a breathless report on CNN saying that Michael Cohen, the former attorney for Donald Trump, would testify to federal prosecutors, including presumably Robert Mueller, that President Donald Trump knew in advance about the controversial Trump Tower
[01:48:48.062 --> 01:48:48.464]  We're good.
[01:48:52.375 --> 01:49:04.983]  Well, we now know that that meeting was A, not illegal, and B, more likely a set-up, because the lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr.
[01:49:05.864 --> 01:49:17.911]  was briefed both before and after the meeting by officials from Fusion GPS, and we still don't know for a certainty what kind of visa
[01:49:18.954 --> 01:49:22.676]  The woman, Russian lawyer, got into the country on.
[01:49:23.257 --> 01:49:37.044]  Now, it quickly became clear when Bernstein reported this story and said that the lady Davis, the attorney for the Clintons, now representing Cohn, was not his source.
[01:49:37.765 --> 01:49:44.809]  Davis undercut him by saying, A, he was the source and B, he was mistaken.
[01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:46.233]  Fair enough.
[01:49:46.754 --> 01:49:53.503]  You would think that a real journalist would then go to the air and apologize and retract and correct.
[01:49:54.023 --> 01:49:59.931]  Well, that's the difference between CNN and Carl Bernstein and we here at InfoWars.
[01:50:00.452 --> 01:50:01.333]  Case in point.
[01:50:02.054 --> 01:50:11.721]  I reported almost 10 days ago, incorrectly as it turns out, that Robert Mueller was seeking to indict Donald Trump Jr.
[01:50:12.101 --> 01:50:16.664]  for lying to the FBI about the Trump Tower meeting.
[01:50:17.484 --> 01:50:22.047]  I now know and want to report that that report was incorrect.
[01:50:22.468 --> 01:50:30.513]  That in fact, the FBI, contrary to what my two sources told me, have not interviewed Donald Trump Jr.
[01:50:31.114 --> 01:50:31.614]  However,
[01:50:32.259 --> 01:50:33.359]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:57.787]  is in Mr. Mueller's crosshairs, not for anything relating, as far as we know, to the Trump Tower meeting, because the payments to Michael Cohen to reimburse Michael Cohen from Donald Trump's personal trust fund had to be signed off by a second executive who was an executor of that fund.
[01:50:58.367 --> 01:51:01.608]  That is likely to be Donald Trump Jr.
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:19.010]  I don't believe there's anything illegal or improper because the payment to Cohn, if it was indeed a reimbursement and a political expenditure, would mean that the president is allowed to contribute to his own campaign without limitation.
[01:51:19.491 --> 01:51:25.795]  Consequently, this would be, at a minimum, a crime of failure to report a contribution.
[01:51:26.475 --> 01:51:28.316]  Usually a $1,000 fine.
[01:51:28.656 --> 01:51:32.077]  So, my apologies to Donald Trump Jr.
[01:51:32.637 --> 01:51:34.058]  I was incorrect.
[01:51:34.518 --> 01:51:41.940]  It doesn't mean that he's not in the special counsel's crosshairs, but he's not in the crosshairs for lying to the FBI.
[01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:43.921]  My sources were incorrect.
[01:51:44.561 --> 01:51:45.961]  I have now corrected it.
[01:51:46.322 --> 01:51:49.522]  That's the difference between Infowars and CNN.
[01:51:50.002 --> 01:51:55.444]  When we make an honest mistake based on our research, we come forward and tell you.
[01:51:55.744 --> 01:52:13.508]  So we've issued a retraction and an apology while still stressing that Donald Trump Jr., a great patriot, a good man in my opinion, reminds me of the old Donald Trump when he was a candidate, is still very much in Mr. Mueller's crosshairs.
[01:52:14.128 --> 01:52:17.231]  I wanted to get that off my chest because it's important.
[01:52:17.691 --> 01:52:19.933]  Truth and accuracy is important.
[01:52:20.253 --> 01:52:22.555]  That's what you get here at InfoWars.
[01:52:22.995 --> 01:52:24.576]  But make no mistake about it.
[01:52:25.076 --> 01:52:32.802]  When Donald Trump came out last week and said that it was necessary to take a close look,
[01:52:34.043 --> 01:52:50.809]  At the tech giants who have, without any dispute, been limiting the voices of conservatives and Republicans and Trump supporters using Alex Jones as the test case, he hit it right on the head.
[01:52:52.572 --> 01:53:11.808]  Believe me, if Alex Jones had not raised hell, had not brought this issue to the public consciousness, the president would never have done that fateful Google search in which he figured out, to his surprise, that the top 10 stories about Donald Trump were uniformly negative.
[01:53:12.609 --> 01:53:16.993]  This is the greatest single challenge the movement
[01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:18.009]  Faces.
[01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:29.654]  Donald Trump could not possibly have won the 2016 election without a robust, vibrant alternative media.
[01:53:30.174 --> 01:53:33.915]  And let's face it, Donald Trump plays Twitter like a fiddle.
[01:53:34.575 --> 01:53:44.359]  The more the left foams and says he needs to stop tweeting, the more I'm delighted and I enjoy every one of his entirely unfiltered tweets.
[01:53:45.239 --> 01:53:46.560]  But we need to be clear.
[01:53:47.555 --> 01:54:07.707]  If the left's campaign of censorship, if their efforts to strangle the First Amendment rights, first of Alex Jones, but then of everybody who questions the mainstream media narrative of lies, is successful, there will be no chances of victory in the 2018 election.
[01:54:08.307 --> 01:54:11.329]  There will be no chances of victory in the 2020 election.
[01:54:13.507 --> 01:54:17.590]  This is the single most important fight before us.
[01:54:18.111 --> 01:54:27.178]  You can argue about tax issues or immigration issues or trade issues, all of the other vital issues that face the country.
[01:54:28.259 --> 01:54:34.985]  But if we have no voice, if our voice is removed, then there is zero chance of victory.
[01:54:35.993 --> 01:54:43.596]  The one patriot who has had no lack of courage in talking about this issue is our friend Tucker Carlson.
[01:54:44.116 --> 01:54:45.876]  Tucker Carlson's had quite a week.
[01:54:46.277 --> 01:55:01.942]  First of all, tangling with Mike Avenatti, the dirty tricks porno lawyer, and then taking it to Jeff Toobin, the CNN legal analyst who every other word out of his mouth is racism, racist, racism.
[01:55:02.595 --> 01:55:03.276]  What a joke.
[01:55:03.716 --> 01:55:12.143]  So here's a shout out to Tucker Carlson because he's been unafraid to talk about the censorship of InfoWars.
[01:55:12.303 --> 01:55:12.683]  Why?
[01:55:13.423 --> 01:55:17.567]  Because Tucker Carlson understands it's a slippery slope.
[01:55:18.227 --> 01:55:27.654]  That if it's Alex Jones and Roger Stone and Owen Schroyer and David Knight today, who will it be tomorrow?
[01:55:28.635 --> 01:55:29.436]  Tucker Carlson?
[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:30.940]  Rush Limbaugh?
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:32.380]  Sean Hannity?
[01:55:33.081 --> 01:55:33.921]  Laura Ingram?
[01:55:34.721 --> 01:55:35.661]  Mark Simone?
[01:55:36.201 --> 01:55:37.161]  Mike Savage?
[01:55:37.841 --> 01:55:39.642]  These are the people that I admire.
[01:55:39.802 --> 01:55:42.162]  The people who bring you truth every day.
[01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:46.123]  Will the next person censored be Mark Levin, the great one?
[01:55:46.883 --> 01:55:48.663]  Believe me, it's a slippery slope.
[01:55:48.963 --> 01:55:58.025]  That's why I ask you again, before the end of this broadcast, please go to the InfoWars.com site and look at our terrific line of products.
[01:55:58.746 --> 01:56:08.852]  People don't seem to understand that what gives InfoWars and Alex Jones the independence to bring you the stone cold truth as it were.
[01:56:09.192 --> 01:56:17.437]  To tell it to you straight from the shoulder without any varnish is the fact that we rely only on our own products.
[01:56:17.897 --> 01:56:45.767]  And their sale to finance what we do at InfoWars, whether it is the super blue oral product line, the toothpaste, the mouthwash, the gargle, whether it is silver bullet, the single best colloidal silver product that you can get on the market today, in which we use a very special electronic process that provides for smaller molecular absorption.
[01:56:46.127 --> 01:56:49.291]  Or whether it is that new silver salve ointment.
[01:56:49.671 --> 01:56:52.074]  These are the best of their genre.
[01:56:52.874 --> 01:57:07.050]  For a good 10 years, Alex Jones has been fusing the very best of ancient herbal Chinese history and medicine with the cutting-edge nutraceuticals to bring you products that are without compare.
[01:57:07.671 --> 01:57:07.911]  Sure,
[01:57:08.817 --> 01:57:10.038]  You can go to Whole Foods.
[01:57:10.438 --> 01:57:11.779]  You can buy products there.
[01:57:11.799 --> 01:57:21.444]  It will sound like our products, but you'll get less of them and the actual ingredients will be substandard compared to what we use here at InfoWars.
[01:57:21.985 --> 01:57:23.225]  This is our lifeblood.
[01:57:23.726 --> 01:57:25.607]  This is what keeps us moving forward.
[01:57:25.947 --> 01:57:29.109]  And if you're not in the market today, find the donate button.
[01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:38.231]  Send us $25, $50, $100, $500, $250, anything to help fuel the fight for freedom.
[01:57:38.691 --> 01:57:39.752]  We need your help.
[01:57:40.212 --> 01:57:41.392]  We appreciate your help.
[01:57:41.792 --> 01:57:44.793]  God bless you for joining the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:57:45.313 --> 01:57:47.894]  And victory or death.
[01:57:52.682 --> 01:57:56.146]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:57:56.646 --> 01:57:59.409]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:57:59.949 --> 01:58:05.755]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:58:06.216 --> 01:58:08.978]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:58:09.699 --> 01:58:13.161]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:58:13.521 --> 01:58:19.605]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:58:20.006 --> 01:58:24.969]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:29.122]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:58:29.642 --> 01:58:36.186]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:58:36.847 --> 01:58:41.530]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:47.273]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:58:47.833 --> 01:58:51.816]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:58:52.463 --> 01:58:57.037]  He's made it more popular, I think, to be openly racist.
