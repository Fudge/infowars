[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:02.091]  Thanks for watching!
[00:00:10.118 --> 00:00:11.479]  All right, your calls are coming up.
[00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:15.821]  Barney and Stan and Fred and Craig and many, many others here momentarily.
[00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:22.724]  In this quick segment, we've got Declan McCullough, award-winning journalist and chief political correspondent for CNET News.
[00:00:23.604 --> 00:00:30.848]  He also writes for Wired and does a lot of work on international law going on with the Internet.
[00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:38.110]  We know with the Total Information Awareness Network and Poindexter and the rest of it, that it's total military occupation.
[00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:48.113]  They wanted to add a internet tracker number to everything you do on the web, and you'd have to use a virtual browser that we offer at infohorse.net once you want them tracking everything you do.
[00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.914]  This is total Fourth Amendment violations they're talking about in the tens of billions a week.
[00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:55.035]  Declan, good to have you on the show, sir.
[00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:56.316]  Hi there.
[00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:57.596]  Thank you for the invitation.
[00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:00.717]  So, what in the New World Order is really going on, Declan?
[00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:03.829]  Well, well put.
[00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.371]  It's a little unclear.
[00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:18.561]  I mean, the problem is that a lot of these are proposals in progress, and you've got these work in papers, all these PowerPoint presentations, and you're trying to figure out what the government actually means.
[00:01:19.342 --> 00:01:27.408]  But what we do know, and this is largely due to the reporting of the New York Times, there was a plan to tag
[00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:37.412]  And that's what the European Union's been asking for, is a way to block their public from Australia to England from our websites.
[00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:05.822]  Yeah, well the Europeans are a separate and somewhat wacky story.
[00:02:06.062 --> 00:02:28.302]  But the broad theme here is that this is coming out of DARPA, a defense department agency, and another defense department project that's also coming out of DARPA is one that is headed by John Poindexter, the retired admiral who got into trouble over Iran-Contra.
[00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:43.256]  Uh, then you have the Department of Homeland Security bill signed into law by President Bush less than an hour ago that makes it easier for police to spy on internet traffic and telephone conversations without a court order first.
[00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:44.757]  It allows
[00:02:45.737 --> 00:02:54.022]  Internet providers like AOL or corporations or universities or what have you to turn over confidential information about subscribers.
[00:02:54.062 --> 00:03:04.849]  Well that's a hallmark of Homeland Security is actually paying big Fortune 500 companies to be spies for the government then not letting corporate employees blow the whistle on that.
[00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:08.122]  Well put.
[00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:30.636]  So what you have, the Poindexter program, the tagging Internet users suggestion, the Department of Homeland Security, now law, all this is coming together in sort of a perfect storm to limit Americans' privacy and increase government
[00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:34.689]  It's exactly the wrong direction.
[00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:42.639]  So they're burrowing in even deeper, secretly, giving themselves more power, taking our rights, while leaving the north and southern borders wide open.
[00:03:44.584 --> 00:03:44.904]  Yes.
[00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.586]  What we should be doing is going the other direction.
[00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:57.971]  We should be protecting privacy while trying to prevent terrorism, but increasing our ability to conduct oversight of government.
[00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:03.114]  I mean, we know that some government people, bureaucrats,
[00:04:03.613 --> 00:04:08.637]  Agencies are perfectly honorable and accountable, but you can't trust all of them.
[00:04:08.777 --> 00:04:20.925]  And so that's why you need open government laws and that kind of thing, which is what the Bush administration is trying to shield against, and the Department of Homeland Security specifically disallows.
[00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:25.688]  Now they'll say, we're not going to do the TIPS program now, but go ahead and ram forward with it.
[00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.270]  Certainly this internet tagging thing isn't dead.
[00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.331]  We know Echelon's already been doing this for decades.
[00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:32.613]  Now they're just going public with this plan, aren't they?
[00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.093]  They are, but it wasn't because they wanted to.
[00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:48.900]  They didn't choose to say, hey, here's our plan, hold a press conference, or maybe another way would have been to brief Congress and say this is what kind of scheme we're concocting.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.443]  That at least would have had the veneer of some sort of public oversight.
[00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:55.945]  What happens is that reporters get a hold of these
[00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.667]  Hold on, then we're making...
[00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:26.568]  Well, Declan McCullough, you're right, you're the chief Washington Bureau chief for Wired News, also political correspondent, chief political correspondent for CNET, news.com.
[00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.411]  I really do appreciate you joining us, and can we have you back up as this thing develops?
[00:05:32.012 --> 00:05:33.052]  I would love to do it.
[00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:35.313]  Fire off those websites real quick for us.
[00:05:36.054 --> 00:05:40.836]  On news.com, also politechbot.com, that's P-O-L-I-T-E-C-H-B-O-T.com.
[00:05:43.846 --> 00:05:45.872]  We've got links to that on InfoWars.com.
[00:05:45.932 --> 00:05:46.193]  Thanks.
[00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:47.035]  Your calls are coming up.
