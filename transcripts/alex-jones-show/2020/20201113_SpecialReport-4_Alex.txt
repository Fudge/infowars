[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.130]  It is November 16, 2015.
[00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.831]  This is about... What?
[00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:08.333]  This is from a certified NewsGuard website that is green across the board.
[00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:10.555]  I think it should be a firing squad.
[00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:11.255]  I vote Bill Gates.
[00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:12.736]  No, you can't say that.
[00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:15.978]  Here's the thing, Bill Gates says... Do you like Apple that much?
[00:00:16.278 --> 00:00:17.058]  No, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:00:17.478 --> 00:00:19.419]  I think it should be a firing squad.
[00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:20.320]  I vote Bill Gates.
[00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.374]  I think there should be a firing squad.
[00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:30.874]  I agree with Bill Gates.
[00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:33.334]  Is that some type of haiku?
[00:00:33.394 --> 00:00:34.075]  Is it poetry?
[00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:46.798]  No, it's Alex Jones, who's been up for about 15 hours, about to make a statement I make all the time on my show that these vaccines untested have hurt a lot of people and it's the equivalent of a modern firing squad.
[00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:55.680]  So I say Bill Gates is lining us up to randomly test on us like guinea pigs in violation of the Geneva Convention and of course the Nuremberg Code.
[00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.443]  As soon as Tim Poole texted me this morning and said, Hey man, you shouldn't have said firing squad for Bill Gates.
[00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:19.474]  I went and I looked at the video and there I was on his biggest podcast ever shot last night, clearly saying that Bill Gates wants to firing squad us with vaccines and laying out the Wuhan virus and how Bill Gates and Fauci had funded
[00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.423]  The study's illegally in Wuhan, which is mainstream news.
[00:01:23.463 --> 00:01:28.586]  New York Post, Associated Press, The Scientist, Newsweek.
[00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:32.468]  And that's why YouTube banned the video.
[00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:33.068]  That's right.
[00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:34.709]  Let me tell you what just happened.
[00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.713]  Tim Pool sent me more text about an hour ago saying, hey man, you shouldn't have said shoot Bill Gates.
[00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.515]  You shouldn't have said firing squad for Bill Gates.
[00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:46.334]  I sent him a text back saying, I remember the video.
[00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:47.695]  I didn't say that.
[00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:52.416]  Well, I just went back and looked at it again, and sure enough, I did not say that.
[00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:54.096]  So this is next level.
[00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:55.216]  And look, I like Tim Pool.
[00:01:55.657 --> 00:02:01.998]  He stood up for me on Joe Rogan's show with the CEO of Twitter whenever they were denying that they were censoring people.
[00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:03.078]  I like Tim Pool.
[00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:03.918]  I watch him all the time.
[00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:04.319]  I listen to him.
[00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.939]  He's a smart guy.
[00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:06.579]  He's a liberal that's kind of woken up.
[00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.999]  I went to his house.
[00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:08.660]  Great people.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.200]  Had an amazing time for almost four hours.
[00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:13.436]  But Tim, this is BS, man.
[00:02:14.037 --> 00:02:24.842]  You've got me for almost four hours, gibbering, laughing, putting on tinfoil hats, having a great time eating pizza, and I'm sitting there, and I mumble something about Bill Gates, and you go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, firing squad.
[00:02:25.363 --> 00:02:27.023]  I get why you thought you heard that.
[00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:32.186]  But when you made an issue out of it, I said, I don't know why I make an issue, because I would never say offensively kill somebody.
[00:02:32.206 --> 00:02:32.947]  I never call for violence.
[00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:33.787]  That's illegal.
[00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:36.128]  Plus, it would turn Bill Gates into a martyr.
[00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:37.209]  So here's the thing.
[00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.511]  YouTube is the lead of the episode.
[00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:40.091]  Okay?
[00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:41.151]  They've censored me.
[00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.933]  And obviously they called you up and said you've got to repudiate Jones.
[00:02:43.993 --> 00:02:47.334]  You put a tweet out saying Jones did this and he violated community standards.
[00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:50.956]  The truth is you got stampeded into this.
[00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:52.057]  You misheard what I said.
[00:02:52.517 --> 00:02:58.400]  And I'm going to play the clip right now for everybody in regular time and in slow time so they can see what I said.
[00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:02.183]  But it's not what I said that got this video banned.
[00:03:02.843 --> 00:03:06.965]  It's the fact that they froze it at 900,000 and by this morning it was a million and something.
[00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:08.606]  It was probably five, six million views.
[00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:10.847]  Joe Rogan was on my show a year ago.
[00:03:11.228 --> 00:03:12.508]  Had five million views in two days.
[00:03:12.528 --> 00:03:12.989]  They deleted it.
[00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:13.809]  That's why.
[00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:27.877]  It's deleted because it's popular and because I told the truth and because it's got Tim Pool, who's a very credible smart guy, up there going, look, Microsoft News Guard agrees that Bill Gates and Fauci were doing illegal Wuhan bat research.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.582]  In Wuhan at that lab.
[00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:32.963]  That's why this is banned.
[00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:33.904]  So I'm going to say it again.
[00:03:33.924 --> 00:03:37.607]  I did not say use a firing squad on Bill Gates.
[00:03:38.628 --> 00:03:40.490]  That's a fraud and we have the clip.
[00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.832]  I said, we need firing squads.
[00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:48.396]  I agree with Bill Gates saying depopulate people, forcibly inoculate people.
[00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:55.122]  And I went on to talk about the Associated Press admitting that most of the polio cases are from the Bill Gates funded UN vaccine.
[00:03:55.382 --> 00:03:56.583]  These are facts.
[00:03:57.597 --> 00:03:59.320]  I thought Tim had a lot of courage having me on.
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.402]  I was surprised he did it.
[00:04:01.123 --> 00:04:09.917]  I'm not mad at Tim, but I'm not going to be defamed and I'm not going to be lied about for the Google overlords that helped run slave camps with Apple.
[00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:15.611]  They're in communist China and who surveil us and throw our elections and do all this.
[00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:16.971]  They are the enemy.
[00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:19.212]  They are the authoritarians, not me.
[00:04:19.712 --> 00:04:20.632]  I'm not the bad guy.
[00:04:20.712 --> 00:04:27.675]  I haven't killed anybody like Apple and Google supporting slave camps in China for the Uyghurs, the Christians and the Buddhists.
[00:04:28.115 --> 00:04:31.836]  I've never killed anybody that didn't assault me first.
[00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:35.918]  So I'm here just putting it on record, Tim, that
[00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:43.612]  If you think Twitter and you think Google and you think Facebook are going to sit there and say, I said, kill Bill Gates and not have the footage.
[00:04:44.132 --> 00:04:45.514]  Sorry, we've got it.
[00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:49.677]  So they may have deleted the episode and had you come out and agree that I'm a bad guy.
[00:04:49.697 --> 00:04:53.621]  And I said this, but the reality is, and the proof is I did not say this.
[00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:55.222]  We're going to play the clip again right now.
[00:04:56.098 --> 00:05:09.143]  Fauci and Gates and Obama five years ago had illegal North Carolina, Chapel Hill, biological testing, airborne gain-of-function, chimera, bat, COVID-19.
[00:05:09.383 --> 00:05:10.724]  They even call it COVID-19.
[00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:12.024]  They even call it COVID-19.
[00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:13.525]  COVID-19 two years ago.
[00:05:14.185 --> 00:05:19.550]  And they develop it, then it leaks out of this lab, and the very people then that are running the company... No, no, no!
[00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.030]  Okay, we got it.
[00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.791]  North Carolina?
[00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:21.892]  You said Gates?
[00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:22.592]  Bill Gates?
[00:05:22.932 --> 00:05:23.713]  Yes.
[00:05:23.773 --> 00:05:29.918]  Microsoft just patented basically a pill that you can swallow that measures your body's heat.
[00:05:29.938 --> 00:05:30.899]  What's the source on that?
[00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.802]  Bitcoin.com, Microsoft cryptocurrency system.
[00:05:33.862 --> 00:05:35.223]  It's called the Internet of Bodies.
[00:05:35.843 --> 00:05:38.626]  They fracture every movement by satellite to make sure you follow the orders.
[00:05:38.646 --> 00:05:39.907]  And it pays you cryptocurrency.
[00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:42.892]  Look up New Scientist.
[00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:59.179]  New Scientist was North Carolina studying dangerous gain-of-function bat coronavirus.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.062]  And it's the exact virus that they then moved to China because it was illegal to test here.
[00:06:06.142 --> 00:06:07.143]  I can't find this one.
[00:06:07.163 --> 00:06:09.544]  The headlines, lab-made coronavirus triggers debate.
[00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:15.743]  from the-scientist.com.
[00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:20.946]  So this is, okay, it is November 16, 2015.
[00:06:23.227 --> 00:06:27.149]  This is from a certified NewsGuard website that is green across the board.
[00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.370]  I think it should be a firing squad.
[00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.071]  I wrote Bill Gates.
[00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:31.552]  No, you can't say that.
[00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:34.793]  Here's the thing, Bill Gates says you'll get rid of all... Do you like Apple that much?
[00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:35.854]  No, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:06:36.755 --> 00:06:39.196]  I just think there should be a firing squad over at Bill Gates.
[00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:44.099]  It's a stone cold fact that I did not say shoot Bill Gates with a firing squad.
[00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:45.800]  If you've already played the video, we'll play it again.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:54.505]  So I demand a retraction by Tim Pool, who is now the voice of YouTube and now the voice of Google, saying that I did call for this.
[00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:55.486]  I'm sorry, Tim.
[00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:56.466]  You misheard me.
[00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:58.628]  Maybe you didn't go back and review the video.
[00:06:58.888 --> 00:06:59.428]  That's fine.
[00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:04.411]  When I make mistakes, it's time for you and Google to admit the mistakes you've made.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.941]  It is November 16, 2015.
[00:07:07.441 --> 00:07:08.181]  Is this is about?
[00:07:08.402 --> 00:07:08.662]  What?
[00:07:09.222 --> 00:07:13.164]  This is from a certified NewsGuard website that is green across the board.
[00:07:13.184 --> 00:07:16.005]  I think it should be a firing squad of road bull guys.
[00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:17.545]  No, you can't say that.
[00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:20.809]  Here's the thing, Bill Gates says you'll get rid of all... Do you like Apple that much?
[00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:21.910]  No, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:25.154]  I think there should be a firing squad over at Bill Gates.
[00:07:25.755 --> 00:07:30.260]  We always knew that a consortium of megacorporations were trying to take over the United States.
[00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:32.242]  We always knew that one day the U.S.
[00:07:32.283 --> 00:07:33.023]  would go under U.N.
[00:07:33.063 --> 00:07:35.747]  control, that we didn't stand up and educate others and say no.
[00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.430]  But they didn't come with blue helmets with the military.
[00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:46.691]  They didn't come with foreign armies and aircraft carriers and fighter jets and bombers and people paratrooping out of the sky like Red Dawn.
[00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:48.512]  They came politically.
[00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:50.792]  They came in the name of fighting racism.
[00:07:51.192 --> 00:07:56.633]  They came in the name of giving everybody free stuff, free houses, free cars, free education.
[00:07:57.153 --> 00:08:04.015]  And now the United Nations is openly running Joe Biden and the Communist Chinese and their COVID-19 response.
