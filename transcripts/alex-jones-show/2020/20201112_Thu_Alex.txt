[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.855]  I'm going to read you globalist Klaus Schwab saying the shutdown will never end and it's meant to depopulate the planet.
[00:00:08.156 --> 00:00:10.198]  And then a new second lockdown's here and it's never going to end.
[00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:18.125]  And then Archbishop writes open letter to Trump warning of COVID health dictatorship because that's all being announced and it's never going to end.
[00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:19.726]  Once they get the chains on you, it never ends.
[00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:25.732]  Now you know we've already laid all this out, we've already explained it all, but they're now admitting it's to depopulate and to collapse things.
[00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.610]  And they're running their hoax.
[00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.612]  Oh, Texas has a million infections.
[00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:34.175]  That's a million people that have tested positive, most of it false positive.
[00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:36.557]  Almost no deaths with the COVID-19.
[00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:45.744]  We now know that they have an anti-human plan that wants to exterminate the population, and now they're admitting it at Davos, saying COVID is just the cover for all this.
[00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.025]  That is such an incredible admission.
[00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:54.647]  And if we don't resist this, our name and our soul is on the billions that are going to die.
[00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:55.307]  And that's the plan.
[00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.507]  Billions from starvation, billions from famine.
[00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.968]  We'll think we're safe in our walled off, compact cities.
[00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:03.329]  They're going to hit us with the weapons here as well, or electromagnetic weapons.
[00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:04.289]  That's the plan.
[00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:06.169]  And that's the truth.
[00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.250]  We are living in the beginning of revelation.
[00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.191]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:26.775]  Well, Melissa Caron is a major whistleblower that just came out of one of the largest voting machine companies in the world, Dominion.
[00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:34.663]  We've been following in my 27 years on air, it's now 27 years, this next week, election fraud.
[00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:36.495]  In great detail.
[00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:39.497]  I interviewed both the Collier brothers that were the original guys exposing it.
[00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:40.317]  I interviewed their daughter.
[00:01:40.337 --> 00:01:42.238]  I've interviewed Bev Harris probably 200 times.
[00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:48.780]  We've gone out and done demonstrations on TV with machines where high schoolers can hack them in about 10 to 15 seconds.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.221]  Dominion is...
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.382]  Out of the top five worst, it's about number two.
[00:01:55.963 --> 00:01:57.204]  There may be one company worse.
[00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:00.886]  And of course, that's the company that's the Carlisle Group owned.
[00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:02.367]  Soros owned one.
[00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:04.829]  Staple Street has a subsidiary.
[00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.331]  And that was in all the key battleground states that flipped for Biden.
[00:02:09.232 --> 00:02:11.974]  So there's only two companies that are the worst in my research.
[00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:12.654]  That's Dominion.
[00:02:13.194 --> 00:02:13.855]  That's Staple Street.
[00:02:15.294 --> 00:02:22.001]  But we're going to play this Lou Dobbs report coming up next segment and it's earth shattering on so many levels.
[00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:29.689]  It will be whistleblowers that bring this down and we have the head of the Federal Elections Commission coming out saying no election fraud is real.
[00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:32.073]  And massive evidence has already been found.
[00:02:32.773 --> 00:02:33.913]  And then he went over that.
[00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:35.414]  That's an article on Infowars.com.
[00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:37.875]  And Tucker Carlson said, they're gaslighting you.
[00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:38.836]  They go, oh, there's no fraud.
[00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:39.456]  It's all made up.
[00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:41.677]  And he even talked about Cavuto just making that up.
[00:02:41.837 --> 00:02:45.559]  Oh, we're cutting away from the White House press conference because they don't have any proof.
[00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.360]  Of course, you don't know they have proof because they cut away before she showed all the damn proof.
[00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:51.221]  We can defeat them.
[00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:57.424]  If they ever get this fraud in, like the Democrats do over blue cities and blue states, this is blue fraud over the whole country.
[00:02:57.684 --> 00:02:58.384]  It never goes back.
[00:02:59.025 --> 00:02:59.785]  That's what I've been telling you.
[00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:05.874]  Again, this is a key statement, not about how people are ignorant, but about how they don't think third dimensionally or fourth dimensionally.
[00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:07.735]  I saw a lot of comments.
[00:03:08.475 --> 00:03:11.497]  If you understand this Rosetta Stone or the skeleton key, you understand everything.
[00:03:11.517 --> 00:03:13.257]  It's like an activator.
[00:03:14.018 --> 00:03:20.881]  They were saying, Alex, why are they having people that have moved out of California vote for Biden when Biden was already going to win the state?
[00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.683]  Well, once you're already flipping everybody's votes and already stealing, you keep stealing to stay in power.
[00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:32.830]  That's why nobody can win as a Republican in California, unless you have like an 80 percent, you know, victory because of the fraud.
[00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.751]  That's why there was 87 percent turnout.
[00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:38.712]  We never had anything near that in the U.S., usually 55, 60 percent.
[00:03:40.013 --> 00:03:46.256]  Because people went out to vote against Biden, and they just got cheated by the computers.
[00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:47.336]  So that's coming up.
[00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:49.577]  But again, people are like, well, why would they cheat in California?
[00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:51.398]  They've already got it, because they already cheated.
[00:03:52.618 --> 00:03:53.699]  It's like saying, well,
[00:03:55.026 --> 00:04:01.011]  You know, if you've remarried and your new wife's pregnant, and you're like, well, why do you have an 18-year-old son?
[00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:02.452]  Well, I got another woman pregnant before.
[00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:05.555]  It's just that there's no third-dimensional thought here.
[00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:07.817]  Why are they stealing steaks they already got?
[00:04:07.837 --> 00:04:09.198]  Because they already got them.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.641]  I mean, let me use another example.
[00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:15.223]  Let's say I'm slaughtering cows.
[00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:20.188]  And I'm about to slaughter a new one for, you know, to put it in my deep freeze.
[00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:25.833]  And people ask, well, why do you keep the other deep freeze going that's got, you know, some of the last count left in it?
[00:04:26.153 --> 00:04:28.455]  It just doesn't even register.
[00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:33.859]  See, once we start thinking third dimensionally, we can defeat the globalists because they're operating third dimensional.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.342]  We can operate fourth, fifth dimension, many plays out.
[00:04:38.823 --> 00:04:39.944]  That's what we do here at Infowars.
[00:04:39.964 --> 00:04:43.187]  I don't know if Trump plays 3D chess or 5D chess, but I know I do.
[00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:53.135]  Because there are logarithms in human activity, and there are algorithms, and history doesn't just repeat, it rhymes, it's synergistic.
[00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:54.636]  And what happens throughout history?
[00:04:57.097 --> 00:05:09.060]  Governments get power, whether it be in ancient China, or ancient Middle East, or ancient Mesoamerica, or ancient Europe, and routinely they have periods where there'll be whole kingdoms, whole civilizations.
[00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:10.209]  I don't
[00:05:34.687 --> 00:05:38.029]  Yes, there's a demonic force, ladies and gentlemen, that's trying to depopulate us.
[00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.290]  And they're announcing it publicly.
[00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.250]  I want to break it down on the other side.
[00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.931]  This is the most important broadcast in the world.
[00:05:43.332 --> 00:05:44.452]  We know what the enemy's next moves are.
[00:05:44.472 --> 00:05:45.072]  We know how to defeat them.
[00:05:45.453 --> 00:05:45.873]  Spread the word.
[00:05:46.693 --> 00:05:51.856]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, coming to you live from Washington, D.C.
[00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:56.038]  I am literally overlooking the White House from where I am coming to you from.
[00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:02.542]  We're going to have a massive demonstration at 12 noon at the park right by the White House on Saturday.
[00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:03.022]  Then we'll march
[00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:18.747]  to the Supreme Court caravan at some points of more than 400 cars some join some leave is on its way right now and is in North Carolina then in Virginia with Owen Schroer and our great crew leading that.
[00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:25.389]  Okay again I am your host Alex Jones and I've thought about doing this broadcast for 26 plus years.
[00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:27.349]  You always think about what could be your last broadcast.
[00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:32.831]  I'm not saying this is my last broadcast but I need to just let you know I need to explain something to you.
[00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:35.198]  I don't
[00:06:55.064 --> 00:07:06.491]  I just ask listeners to understand that we need to get on our knees and pray to God for discernment, and pray to God to protect the whistleblowers, and pray to God for his spirit to be poured out upon us to move upon this nation, and to move upon the world.
[00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:16.797]  And we pray to God, our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, to heal our land, and that we pledge to fight evil, and we pledge to fight corruption, and fight for the unborn, and we pledge to take the planet back.
[00:07:17.378 --> 00:07:20.259]  If God will simply heal our land, and we know that Trump was a
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:33.243]  Test to see if we would fight for ourselves and to give us a chance to have a reprieve like when Jonah went to Nineveh with a hundred-year reprieve and we pray that that can still happen.
[00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:34.264]  We know he won the election.
[00:07:34.284 --> 00:07:35.004]  The evidence is mounting.
[00:07:35.044 --> 00:07:38.325]  We thank you for all these bold whistleblowers who you've touched their hearts to go public.
[00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:39.605]  That's the Achilles heel of the enemy.
[00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:44.947]  We just pray that listeners and viewers realize how important they are right now and how critical is this.
[00:07:45.707 --> 00:07:48.988]  Now, next segment I'm going to play
[00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:57.564]  A major Dominion software whistleblower, who has incredible courage, about the systemic election fraud in all the key states.
[00:07:58.085 --> 00:07:59.506]  It was Dominion, it was Staple Street.
[00:08:00.927 --> 00:08:06.671]  In the key states, like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, it's all the same group.
[00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:08.793]  They've been decertified in most other states.
[00:08:09.954 --> 00:08:14.177]  Texas, North Carolina, places like that, where Trump won, Florida.
[00:08:16.027 --> 00:08:21.431]  And so there is mountains of election fraud, mountains of whistleblowers, mountains of evidence.
[00:08:21.991 --> 00:08:26.474]  And you see the Washington Post go, oh, the postal worker, he admits it's all made up.
[00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:27.735]  And then it's all made up.
[00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:28.916]  Washington Post doesn't have that.
[00:08:28.936 --> 00:08:29.616]  The guy didn't say that.
[00:08:30.037 --> 00:08:32.058]  They are in desperate criminal mode.
[00:08:32.098 --> 00:08:34.320]  In fact, Rob, I forgot the Washington Post article I had.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.582]  You have my keys?
[00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:38.502]  I think they're right over there.
[00:08:38.983 --> 00:08:39.743]  My keys are right over there.
[00:08:40.704 --> 00:08:41.104]  You got my key?
[00:08:41.945 --> 00:08:43.166]  It's just laying right there on the desk.
[00:08:44.411 --> 00:08:45.372]  I want you to be able to watch them post.
[00:08:46.152 --> 00:08:49.574]  So we're going to be laying all of this out for everybody.
[00:08:50.775 --> 00:08:52.396]  But I just want to say something up front here.
[00:08:53.517 --> 00:08:55.198]  We've never lived in more historical times.
[00:08:55.858 --> 00:09:00.541]  This is one of the most historical points in history, except when Jesus Christ was walking on the earth.
[00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:01.222]  That was more important.
[00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:04.477]  1776 was not as important as this.
[00:09:05.017 --> 00:09:06.098]  It was all part of the same chain.
[00:09:06.938 --> 00:09:09.138]  I am here to tell you heads above the rest.
[00:09:09.658 --> 00:09:10.238]  I'm getting chills.
[00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:15.959]  We have never lived in any time like this that will govern the future energy of where things go.
[00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:18.720]  So I'm going to break down the election.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.860]  I'm going to break down what's unfolding.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.220]  In the next hour, I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.361]  But I'm also going to do what I meant to do on Monday.
[00:09:24.381 --> 00:09:31.202]  I'm going to read you globalist Klaus Schwab saying the shutdown will never end and it's meant to depopulate the planet.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.582]  And then a new second lockdown's here and it's never gonna end.
[00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:42.468]  And then Archbishop writes an open letter to Trump warning of COVID health dictatorship because that's all being announced and it's never gonna end.
[00:09:42.628 --> 00:09:44.089]  Once they get the chains on you, it never ends.
[00:09:44.109 --> 00:09:50.113]  Now you know we've already laid all this out, we've already explained it all, but they're now admitting it's to depopulate and to collapse things.
[00:09:51.835 --> 00:09:52.976]  And they're running their hoax.
[00:09:53.096 --> 00:09:54.977]  Oh, Texas has a million infections.
[00:09:55.638 --> 00:09:58.540]  That's a million people that have tested positive, most of it false positive.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.541]  Almost no deaths with the COVID-19.
[00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:03.596]  And so it's simply incredible.
[00:10:04.216 --> 00:10:07.199]  I'm going to get to all of that coming up later.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.103]  But the first thing I'm going to do right now, and I'm good, Rob.
[00:10:12.163 --> 00:10:12.864]  I know what I want out of there.
[00:10:12.884 --> 00:10:13.144]  Thank you.
[00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:16.707]  Are you just distracting with a newspaper over there?
[00:10:16.727 --> 00:10:18.689]  I'm just looking at it like a dog looking at a piece of meat.
[00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.571]  But I'm going to get to that in a minute.
[00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:21.011]  It's all right.
[00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:26.076]  I'm doing it different in the hotel room as people are wandering around the hotel room.
[00:10:26.096 --> 00:10:26.636]  I'm doing the show.
[00:10:26.696 --> 00:10:26.917]  It's fine.
[00:10:26.937 --> 00:10:27.497]  He's doing a great job.
[00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:31.781]  Look, I'm just going to tell you where I'm at.
[00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:36.527]  I have been under such stress knowing we have a chance to stop this and save billions of people.
[00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:40.129]  And the stress has been on me that I... Howard Stern made jokes about it.
[00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:44.031]  It's a funny viral video about how I had three molars collapse the last two months.
[00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:46.972]  I mean, all my teeth are literally crushing and falling out of my face.
[00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:50.254]  I have to wear a splint at night or I bite down on it.
[00:10:50.314 --> 00:10:51.475]  And I'm not feeling sorry for myself.
[00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:55.177]  My spirit is absolutely lashing out at this and fighting.
[00:10:55.237 --> 00:11:01.220]  And God really last night sent the Holy Spirit to me to comfort me and to say, listen, this is the way it's going to be.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.701]  And it's your job to just get people ready.
[00:11:04.842 --> 00:11:06.963]  And you've done your job, now you just need to get them ready.
[00:11:07.404 --> 00:11:09.865]  So I'm just going to tell you, it's all over, folks.
[00:11:10.546 --> 00:11:15.509]  The best thing you can do is get to the countryside somewhere and try to dig in, because it's all just going to get worse.
[00:11:15.729 --> 00:11:24.075]  And as soon as they get everybody to accept these lockdowns and forced inoculations that lower the immunity, they're going to release mass bioweapons and kill billions of people.
[00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:25.415]  And I don't just say that.
[00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:30.439]  You will watch billions die with blood pouring out of their eyes, their ears, their mouths, okay?
[00:11:31.195 --> 00:11:34.919]  I mean, you're going to watch absolute mass extermination.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.541]  We didn't stand up for the children.
[00:11:36.561 --> 00:11:37.482]  We didn't stand up for God.
[00:11:38.243 --> 00:11:41.146]  And we rejected Christ, and Satan now is coming into the earth.
[00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.028]  And I'm not trying to be negative.
[00:11:43.885 --> 00:11:45.507]  Everybody wants to hear all this positive lies.
[00:11:46.447 --> 00:11:48.129]  All you can do is get right with Christ.
[00:11:48.349 --> 00:11:49.130]  I can tell you that right now.
[00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.531]  We can hold him back.
[00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:51.832]  Trump may still prevail.
[00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:54.595]  But we've seen the model of the devil's attack.
[00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:57.037]  It's exactly what Revelation says, but now we're in it.
[00:11:57.618 --> 00:12:01.622]  We are now entering Satan's first big lash with his plan.
[00:12:02.262 --> 00:12:06.786]  And he'll keep going and going and going until he makes war on the saints and overcomes them.
[00:12:07.106 --> 00:12:10.408]  Then there'll be a giant revival, people will wake up, they'll fall away from the enemy.
[00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:12.310]  We're seeing a sub-model of that now.
[00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:18.855]  That's how the Bible, that's how history works, is there's waves and it repeats itself but it gets more intense like birth pains, again as the Bible says.
[00:12:20.536 --> 00:12:26.081]  And so, we're seeing a huge awakening but we're also seeing a huge rise of evil and it's just going to get more and more intense.
[00:12:27.093 --> 00:12:31.015]  The stuff you see today will be nothing compared to what you see in 10, 20 years.
[00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:37.637]  And I don't know all the timelines, but the globalists always tell us what they're going to do in their internal documents that are public.
[00:12:38.017 --> 00:12:39.658]  They don't promote them, but it's a metaphysical rule.
[00:12:39.678 --> 00:12:45.540]  They got to tell you what they're doing, kind of leave the plans laying on the roadside so you have a chance to read the fine print if you can find it.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.661]  Kind of a public notice.
[00:12:47.341 --> 00:12:48.742]  That's why you have public notices.
[00:12:48.782 --> 00:12:54.184]  They're going to take a piece of property or public notice they're about to tear something down or public notice they're about to take a park away from you.
[00:12:55.362 --> 00:13:02.027]  I was there to give you notice because you have metaphysical, spiritual rights, unalienable rights to challenge that.
[00:13:02.067 --> 00:13:03.488]  This is common law.
[00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:04.549]  This is galactic law.
[00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:05.369]  This is God's law.
[00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:08.451]  And even the devil has to follow it and has to trick you to sign it over.
[00:13:09.492 --> 00:13:21.741]  But they're going to get most of the world to sign on to this, to get free goodies and to be able to go to the movies or go to the ballgames or, you know, have your tracker chipped, be able to go see a movie or go see a music concert.
[00:13:22.415 --> 00:13:30.702]  They're going to make fun of everybody that doesn't have it, and we'll be putting ghettos and all the rest of it for those that haven't already gotten positioned in communities outside of this.
[00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:33.485]  And they're going to come for us in our communities, just like the Bible says.
[00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:45.736]  And they're going to have swarms of metal insects, like the Bible describes in Revelation, just swarms of what look like scorpions flying around attacking people.
[00:13:46.988 --> 00:13:48.389]  I mean, that's drones, folks.
[00:13:48.409 --> 00:13:49.010]  That's robots.
[00:13:49.611 --> 00:13:52.033]  And pillars of fire the size of mountains.
[00:13:52.093 --> 00:13:55.056]  And this is what John the Revelator was shown to understand it.
[00:13:55.096 --> 00:13:56.678]  Well, we're now beginning to see it.
[00:13:58.099 --> 00:14:00.362]  And these men have sold out to Satan to have power over the Earth.
[00:14:00.782 --> 00:14:07.029]  And his main order is kill the planet, kill all carbon-based life forms, override it with my silicon system.
[00:14:08.086 --> 00:14:10.368]  So we're seeing Satan's body.
[00:14:10.428 --> 00:14:11.009]  It's glass.
[00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.171]  It's the lightbearer.
[00:14:14.012 --> 00:14:15.734]  And it's what it is.
[00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:16.775]  It's psychotic.
[00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:17.636]  It's sociopathic.
[00:14:18.296 --> 00:14:19.658]  It's completely twisted.
[00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:27.045]  And I'm going to stop getting into the metaphysical and get into what's happening when we come back with the great news.
[00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:31.170]  With Dominion Whistleblower coming out, one of the biggest voting machines.
[00:14:32.361 --> 00:14:32.541]  Yeah.
[00:14:54.656 --> 00:15:02.778]  That is such an incredible admission, and if we don't resist this, our name and our soul is on the billions that are going to die.
[00:15:02.798 --> 00:15:03.418]  And that's the plan.
[00:15:03.518 --> 00:15:05.619]  Billions from starvation, billions from famine.
[00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:11.460]  We'll think we're safe in our walled-off, compact cities, that they're going to hit us with the weapons here as well, or electromagnetic weapons.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.401]  That's the plan.
[00:15:13.061 --> 00:15:14.281]  And that's the truth.
[00:15:14.821 --> 00:15:16.362]  We are living in the beginning of Revelation.
[00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:17.182]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:17.282 --> 00:15:20.863]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Band.Video.
[00:15:20.883 --> 00:15:21.523]  Please share those links.
[00:15:23.783 --> 00:15:25.224]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.704]  It's what everyone's talking about.
[00:15:27.265 --> 00:15:29.866]  We were watching C-SPAN, Washington Journal, this morning.
[00:15:29.926 --> 00:15:31.627]  Almost every caller here in D.C.
[00:15:32.207 --> 00:15:35.789]  was calling in to C-SPAN, a lot of you may have seen it, saying, what about Dominion?
[00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:37.269]  What about the whistleblower?
[00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.570]  What about Lou Dobbs last night?
[00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.811]  Why isn't this on regular Fox News?
[00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:42.292]  Because there is no fraud.
[00:15:42.952 --> 00:15:45.994]  Even though the Georgia officials and others have said we've already found fraud.
[00:15:46.014 --> 00:15:48.255]  They've already found it in Arizona, they've already found it in Nevada.
[00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:49.976]  And that's why the Washington Post
[00:15:50.902 --> 00:15:52.563]  That's a headline very angrily today.
[00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:57.825]  President Trump, efforts to thwart Biden's victory start taking shape.
[00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:02.588]  Lawyers lobby to delay certifying the vote because that's the law.
[00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:04.841]  That's Jeff Bezos' rag.
[00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:08.363]  Here is the whistleblower with Lou Dobbs.
[00:16:08.403 --> 00:16:10.083]  This is the information they don't want you to see.
[00:16:10.644 --> 00:16:16.066]  It's posted at Infowars.com and we're going to post it at Band.video in case they take it down off YouTube.
[00:16:16.426 --> 00:16:17.546]  Share it to the four winds.
[00:16:17.986 --> 00:16:19.447]  Remember, Twitter's trying to block this.
[00:16:19.627 --> 00:16:22.928]  Only you can override them word of mouth at Infowars.com.
[00:16:23.168 --> 00:16:24.669]  Here is the great Patriot, Lou Dobbs.
[00:16:29.594 --> 00:16:30.495]  Breaking news now.
[00:16:30.755 --> 00:16:35.938]  We have obtained a new whistleblower complaint from a woman in Wayne County, Michigan.
[00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:44.703]  It lays out in detail what appears to be outright illegality that took place inside the TCF Center in downtown Detroit.
[00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:52.748]  The sworn affidavit signed by IT worker Melissa Carone exposes how ballots were scanned and counted.
[00:16:53.368 --> 00:16:55.209]  In some cases, multiple times.
[00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:02.654]  How Republicans were pushed aside, cut out of the oversight process to which they are entitled.
[00:17:03.335 --> 00:17:07.918]  And even details of how ballots were illegally altered by other election workers.
[00:17:08.678 --> 00:17:22.609]  Part of her affidavit reads, quote, I witnessed countless workers re-scanning the batches without discarding them first, which resulted in ballots being counted four to five times.
[00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:28.374]  Joining us tonight with much more is the author of that sworn affidavit, Melissa Carone.
[00:17:28.975 --> 00:17:36.121]  She was contracted by Dominion Voting Services to offer technical support while votes were being counted in Detroit.
[00:17:36.781 --> 00:17:40.842]  David Coleman, who is Melissa's attorney, joins us here this evening.
[00:17:40.882 --> 00:17:41.903]  We welcome you both.
[00:17:42.983 --> 00:17:58.528]  And Melissa, I want to just say, first of all, my compliments to you for having the courage to step forward and to say exactly what you saw and to defend the integrity of our electoral process.
[00:17:58.548 --> 00:18:04.410]  And I want you to know I'm deeply grateful and I'm sure all Americans are deeply grateful to you.
[00:18:05.411 --> 00:18:12.777]  Let me start with the most egregious part of what I read in your affidavit.
[00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:16.020]  Multiple counts of the same ballots.
[00:18:16.941 --> 00:18:17.821]  How did that happen?
[00:18:19.643 --> 00:18:26.349]  So the workers are handed ballots in stacks of 50s.
[00:18:26.609 --> 00:18:28.290]  They are referred to as batches.
[00:18:29.752 --> 00:18:32.034]  And they run them through the tabulators.
[00:18:33.877 --> 00:18:40.263]  When the ballot has any kind of a mark on it, it'll stop.
[00:18:40.943 --> 00:18:47.890]  The tabulator will stop completely and the computer will put up an error and it'll say, you know, ballot number 25.
[00:18:50.794 --> 00:18:52.075]  has an error.
[00:18:53.695 --> 00:19:13.725]  So the process would be to take ballot number 25, as well as all of the other ballots that had already went through the tabulator, off, put them back in a pile, put ballot number 25 on top of the stack, discard the whole batch, and re-scan it.
[00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:21.291]  And instead, they went through that process several times.
[00:19:23.092 --> 00:19:29.996]  Describe the night shift chaos that you described.
[00:19:30.316 --> 00:19:36.560]  Food vans apparently showing up, but not with food, but with ballots, apparently.
[00:19:37.101 --> 00:19:39.142]  Give us a sense of what happened there.
[00:19:40.037 --> 00:19:42.859]  So I worked a 24-hour shift.
[00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:44.900]  I started at 6 a.m.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.201]  and I got off at 6 a.m.
[00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:48.281]  the next day.
[00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:52.123]  So I started at 6 a.m.
[00:19:52.223 --> 00:19:55.625]  November 3rd, got off at 6 a.m.
[00:19:55.865 --> 00:19:56.365]  November 4th.
[00:19:57.566 --> 00:20:00.807]  So I was there during their day shift and their night shift.
[00:20:02.468 --> 00:20:07.810]  The city provides the workers with food for their shift.
[00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:13.893]  Well, they only had enough food for one-third of their workers.
[00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:21.116]  So that is the reason why they were claiming that these vans were brought in.
[00:20:23.077 --> 00:20:25.818]  But these vans did not have food taken out of them.
[00:20:26.866 --> 00:20:32.728]  And the vans that showed up, they were supposed to be filled with food.
[00:20:32.908 --> 00:20:33.828]  What did they have in them?
[00:20:34.548 --> 00:20:34.988]  Do you know?
[00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:40.690]  I never saw anything being brought out of the vans.
[00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:46.251]  I know that whatever was being brought out of the vans was being brought out of the back of the vans.
[00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:50.532]  But I was not allowed over in that area at all.
[00:20:50.973 --> 00:20:56.014]  But the vans were definitely not big enough to be carrying enough food for two-thirds of those workers.
[00:20:58.953 --> 00:21:01.134]  Well, it's all very suspicious.
[00:21:01.554 --> 00:21:08.236]  It is very clear that you have witnessed highly irregular activities in that counting session.
[00:21:08.296 --> 00:21:09.596]  And David, I want to turn to you.
[00:21:10.837 --> 00:21:22.300]  How well protected is Melissa as a contractor for Dominion Voting Systems and your role here?
[00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:26.818]  Well, I'm the lead attorney with Great Lakes Justice Center.
[00:21:26.838 --> 00:21:31.081]  We filed the complaint on behalf of two voters and residents of Wayne County.
[00:21:31.622 --> 00:21:36.546]  Melissa is one of our witnesses who provided an affidavit, as well as many other people.
[00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:45.733]  We have affidavits from another whistleblower, Jessie Jacob, who is an employee of the City of Detroit, worked in the election department.
[00:21:46.234 --> 00:21:49.657]  She delineates all kinds of fraud and problems she saw.
[00:21:50.237 --> 00:22:04.705]  And then also an attorney, Zachary Larson, who's a former Michigan Assistant Attorney General, worked under both Republican and Democrat administrations, and he saw many acts that were incredibly concerning to him.
[00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:14.171]  We got an affidavit just this afternoon, Lou, from Ruth Johnson, who is our former Secretary of State, who just left that position two years ago.
[00:22:14.952 --> 00:22:27.326]  And she reviewed our complaint and all the affidavits and she recommended to the court, we had a hearing today at 3 o'clock, and she recommended to the court that the court intervene and take action to order an audit.
[00:22:27.687 --> 00:22:33.614]  Michigan now has a new constitutional provision that allows voters to request a results-oriented audit.
[00:22:34.275 --> 00:22:37.158]  To ensure the accuracy and integrity of elections.
[00:22:37.538 --> 00:22:39.480]  So we're asking the court, and we did it today.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.721]  We had about a two-hour hearing.
[00:22:40.741 --> 00:22:46.847]  All right, folks, the full interview is at InfoWars.com, but notice the headline's never even strong enough.
[00:22:47.207 --> 00:22:49.489]  It's not one whistleblower about Dominion.
[00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.813]  It's a whole bunch of whistleblowers, and the bigger story is the food trucks
[00:22:54.634 --> 00:23:00.318]  Delivering the ballots, which we caught them in other areas doing, or repair companies, or there's a water main broken.
[00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:02.520]  This is an organized crime takeover.
[00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:05.843]  The globalists never got in trouble for all their other crimes and all their other coup attempts.
[00:23:06.283 --> 00:23:07.144]  So this is the big one.
[00:23:07.544 --> 00:23:09.666]  Trump may not concede.
[00:23:09.746 --> 00:23:10.406]  He may not.
[00:23:11.167 --> 00:23:11.807]  Or he's a traitor.
[00:23:12.127 --> 00:23:13.048]  He must fight them.
[00:23:13.348 --> 00:23:14.369]  We must take this country back.
[00:23:14.389 --> 00:23:15.570]  This is a foreign takeover.
[00:23:16.231 --> 00:23:18.052]  Biden has announced he will abolish the border.
[00:23:18.312 --> 00:23:19.313]  He's coming for the guns.
[00:23:19.353 --> 00:23:20.354]  He's a Chinese agent.
[00:23:21.138 --> 00:23:29.862]  And this is absolutely insane, ladies and gentlemen, but the good news is whistleblowers are the Achilles heel of these horrible demons, and we salute them, and more are coming out.
[00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.503]  The level of fraud is insane.
[00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:35.605]  It's all online at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:23:35.645 --> 00:23:41.607]  We're going to come back and hit the big picture, and what's coming next in the announcement of the new permanent lockdown.
[00:23:42.107 --> 00:23:45.189]  And Boris Johnson of UK says he is now under Bill Gates' command.
[00:23:45.689 --> 00:23:47.993]  And now the UK will be running the G7 for the next year.
[00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:54.623]  Bill Gates will be the unofficial shadow head of the G7, taking governmental power over the EU.
[00:23:55.043 --> 00:23:57.687]  If that ain't Margaret the Beast, then nothing is.
[00:23:57.948 --> 00:23:58.449]  Stay with us.
[00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:02.288]  This is an important announcement.
[00:24:03.048 --> 00:24:07.372]  The lame duck president of the United States is in the throes of profound paranoid delusions.
[00:24:07.892 --> 00:24:09.274]  Perhaps even hallucinations.
[00:24:09.874 --> 00:24:16.100]  And he must be removed from office as soon as possible via the 25th Amendment or by any other legal means.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.803]  Waiting 75 days is no longer possible.
[00:24:23.367 --> 00:24:23.727]  70 days.
[00:24:24.007 --> 00:24:28.129]  You know, he'll be gone in 70 days anyway, once the Electoral College meets and we have the inauguration.
[00:24:28.749 --> 00:24:31.049]  70 days, you can do a lot of damage in 70 days.
[00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:33.070]  He still is the President of the United States.
[00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.751]  In two months, he's either getting inaugurated or incarcerated.
[00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:36.671]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:39.632]  Donald Trump is going to serve another term.
[00:24:39.692 --> 00:24:43.273]  We just don't know whether it will be in Washington or in prison yet.
[00:24:43.353 --> 00:24:47.154]  It is clear that Donald Trump is trying to exercise the power because he can.
[00:24:47.635 --> 00:24:49.075]  And he is going to settle scores.
[00:24:49.595 --> 00:24:53.677]  But I'm very concerned what he might do in his remaining 70 days in office.
[00:24:53.777 --> 00:25:02.000]  What damage do you think that Trump will do between losing the election and the swearing, the inauguration of Joe Biden?
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.701]  Is he going to pull out?
[00:25:04.601 --> 00:25:05.462]  It's military?
[00:25:05.882 --> 00:25:07.304]  Is he going to engage us?
[00:25:07.584 --> 00:25:11.007]  He has already alluded to there may be a civil war.
[00:25:11.167 --> 00:25:13.909]  What can be done to stop anything he wants to do in the next 70 days?
[00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:28.621]  Well, if Vice President Pence and the cabinet had an ounce of fortitude and spine and patriotism, I think they would seriously consider invoking the 25th Amendment and, you know, pushing Donald Trump out because he is just very unpredictable now.
[00:25:28.721 --> 00:25:30.082]  He's like a cornered cat.
[00:25:30.682 --> 00:25:31.023]  Tiger.
[00:25:31.443 --> 00:25:32.684]  And he is going to lash out.
[00:25:32.904 --> 00:25:43.431]  Then we have to be prepared for what he is going to do in the immediate aftermath of such a loss and what he'll do for the time period between the election and the inauguration of the next president.
[00:25:43.551 --> 00:25:56.480]  Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out and eventually, I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:02.564]  The United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House, which is just
[00:26:03.384 --> 00:26:04.925]  Nice sentence to hear.
[00:26:05.045 --> 00:26:10.548]  The president came out into the White House briefing room and lied for 15 minutes.
[00:26:10.588 --> 00:26:23.413]  Just nonsensical stuff about illegal vote dumps and corrupt election officials and secret democratic counting cabals and I don't know, long form birth certificates probably.
[00:26:23.634 --> 00:26:24.474]  It's all the same.
[00:26:24.514 --> 00:26:26.515]  At the end of that speech, he should have been arrested.
[00:26:26.975 --> 00:26:31.077]  If they could have found handcuffs small enough to take him away, they would have.
[00:26:31.377 --> 00:26:36.740]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.461]  So do you think the president is a national security threat?
[00:26:39.881 --> 00:26:40.101]  I do.
[00:26:40.342 --> 00:26:45.224]  And the fact again that he has the powers of the presidency in his hands is quite worrisome.
[00:26:45.464 --> 00:26:47.285]  This president's going to try to steal this election.
[00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:48.126]  Tomorrow?
[00:26:48.906 --> 00:26:49.746]  Come here tomorrow.
[00:26:50.187 --> 00:26:52.388]  We're going to be talking about the 25th Amendment.
[00:26:55.489 --> 00:26:56.390]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[00:26:57.891 --> 00:26:58.471]  Got fired.
[00:27:01.104 --> 00:27:06.427]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live with one of the most important broadcasts I've ever done, if not the most important.
[00:27:06.467 --> 00:27:13.512]  And I'm sure next week will be more important because everything is intensifying as we march up this mountain of escalation.
[00:27:15.393 --> 00:27:16.533]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:27:16.553 --> 00:27:17.354]  Very honored to be here.
[00:27:17.374 --> 00:27:18.955]  Very thankful to all the listeners and viewers.
[00:27:18.995 --> 00:27:20.296]  Very thankful for all the affiliates.
[00:27:20.916 --> 00:27:23.938]  Very thankful to the great crew back in Austin, Texas.
[00:27:24.058 --> 00:27:28.260]  And I'm just, the only way I can talk to you is from the heart and where I'm at before I hit all this news.
[00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:30.442]  I am devastated.
[00:27:31.727 --> 00:27:32.608]  I am devastated.
[00:27:33.548 --> 00:27:38.011]  It's not just that I've learned that I have cancer and that I'm dying.
[00:27:39.652 --> 00:27:41.533]  It's I've learned we all have cancer and we're all dying.
[00:27:42.213 --> 00:27:46.916]  I don't literally have cancer, though you have cancer every day and your body kills it with your immune system.
[00:27:47.897 --> 00:27:51.439]  Our civilization, our society is being culled.
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.560]  We are being exterminated.
[00:27:54.141 --> 00:27:54.941]  We are being replaced.
[00:27:54.981 --> 00:27:56.082]  You know, the Native Americans
[00:27:57.904 --> 00:28:00.945]  At least early on figured out they were being replaced and they were being exterminated.
[00:28:01.445 --> 00:28:03.366]  You know, most of the white settlers didn't exterminate them.
[00:28:04.026 --> 00:28:10.048]  Most of them actually liked them, but there was always some that always would come that would always would exterminate them.
[00:28:10.628 --> 00:28:13.149]  Because they had more advanced law, more advanced technology.
[00:28:13.589 --> 00:28:15.470]  They didn't respect the quote, savages.
[00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.010]  They took their property away and they killed them.
[00:28:19.871 --> 00:28:21.892]  Those didn't assimilate, but most died.
[00:28:23.072 --> 00:28:25.833]  And that's what this is, but at least the Native Americans
[00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:43.935]  When the Iron Horse showed up, when the locomotive showed up in the Midwest, their chief said 30, 40, 50 years before they were driven out, this is the end of us and we better move to more remote areas and we better not help these people.
[00:28:45.452 --> 00:28:47.233]  Now I'm not lionizing the Native Americans.
[00:28:47.273 --> 00:29:00.040]  They were all fighting each other and doing the same kind of stuff, but all I'm saying is I respect them because they were recognizing the existential threat to them and they understood what it was right up front.
[00:29:01.701 --> 00:29:08.585]  Because they lived off the land and they had their ear to the ground and they were dialed into nature and God's creation and they understood what was happening.
[00:29:12.901 --> 00:29:15.283]  At least the Native Americans can assimilate in some cases.
[00:29:15.763 --> 00:29:24.008]  I mean, most people in Texas or Oklahoma are part Native American because the truth is, wives died a lot out on the frontier.
[00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:30.413]  And most of my ancestors, a lot of them, you know, had Native American wives.
[00:29:30.993 --> 00:29:31.573]  Some were in there.
[00:29:31.914 --> 00:29:36.137]  Some of them had four or five wives that ended up dying, you know, over and over again in childbirth.
[00:29:36.777 --> 00:29:39.099]  I have ancestors that had 20, 30, 40, 50 children.
[00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:42.461]  But my point is, is some of that Native American blood lives on on me.
[00:29:44.127 --> 00:29:48.569]  The globalists are not trying to assimilate us.
[00:29:48.689 --> 00:29:50.909]  They don't want us to be in the future with them.
[00:29:50.949 --> 00:29:52.550]  It's worse than what the Native Americans face.
[00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:53.650]  It's extermination.
[00:29:55.291 --> 00:29:56.251]  It's total destruction.
[00:29:56.331 --> 00:30:06.035]  And so I'm sitting here last night and this morning thinking about what I'm going to say today on the air because of all the announcements and all the statements that have been made confirming our worst analysis and then some.
[00:30:06.895 --> 00:30:12.397]  And I don't feel good coming on air telling you that
[00:30:14.758 --> 00:30:15.258]  We're all dead.
[00:30:18.561 --> 00:30:23.904]  But I want to explain to you the reality of this, and we'll do it next segment because I'm very emotional right now.
[00:30:25.465 --> 00:30:42.217]  A lot of good things are happening, but when you have the head of the Davos Group, which is basically the European aristocracy at the end of World War II, the real Nazis, and they are deploying a planetary world government that openly says it's going to carry out forced depopulation.
[00:30:43.550 --> 00:31:10.183]  And they're saying in books they publish and articles they put out that we show you here on air, and quote, that COVID-19 is just an excuse to save the planet by cutting off the resources, bankrupting the first world, and that when the third world collapses, they're going to merge the first and third world together with a ruling elite tax exempt above us, and then they're going to have contact tracing, forced inoculations,
[00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:12.537]  Apps to have a job.
[00:31:12.717 --> 00:31:13.857]  Apps to go to the grocery store.
[00:31:13.877 --> 00:31:14.938]  It's already being announced.
[00:31:15.098 --> 00:31:16.338]  Apps to go to a rock concert.
[00:31:16.518 --> 00:31:18.039]  Apps to be at the university.
[00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:20.220]  And a lot of people say, well, I'll just submit to that.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.081]  I'll adapt to that.
[00:31:21.621 --> 00:31:23.242]  You don't adapt to something.
[00:31:23.262 --> 00:31:24.522]  You don't adapt to a woodchipper.
[00:31:25.203 --> 00:31:31.666]  You know, if the mafia grabbed you and was about to put you in a woodchipper, you wouldn't say, well, I think I'm just going to adapt to being in little bloody chunks.
[00:31:32.066 --> 00:31:32.726]  You'd fight back.
[00:31:32.766 --> 00:31:34.007]  You'd try to not be put in a woodchipper.
[00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:37.749]  The Native Americans knew they were being fed into a woodchipper.
[00:31:39.414 --> 00:31:43.836]  But at least some of their genetics goes on because they intermarried.
[00:31:43.936 --> 00:31:44.917]  Some of them survived.
[00:31:45.137 --> 00:31:45.277]  On.
[00:31:45.997 --> 00:31:47.278]  There's no surviving.
[00:31:47.318 --> 00:31:49.059]  It's like Star Trek when the Borg shows up.
[00:31:49.759 --> 00:31:50.760]  It wants to assimilate you.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.680]  This doesn't even want to assimilate us.
[00:31:54.241 --> 00:31:58.543]  The creed of the transhumanist globalist is no carbon lifeforms.
[00:31:58.603 --> 00:31:59.424]  Carbon is evil.
[00:32:01.125 --> 00:32:01.705]  I mean, imagine
[00:32:04.232 --> 00:32:07.075]  A science fiction movie where aliens show up and say, all carbon is the enemy.
[00:32:07.395 --> 00:32:11.899]  We'll let you upload yourself to silicon, but you have to agree to destroy all carbon on Earth.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.401]  We're here for an overwrite.
[00:32:13.621 --> 00:32:14.962]  And some go, I will join you.
[00:32:15.603 --> 00:32:18.225]  I don't know if the aliens are real, but everything to that point is real.
[00:32:18.525 --> 00:32:19.647]  They believe they're new humans.
[00:32:19.907 --> 00:32:21.568]  They believe they're God, like Ray Kurzweil says.
[00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:24.731]  They believe they're about to take over the planet, and they're satanically inspired.
[00:32:25.012 --> 00:32:27.994]  We can still stop them, but only getting close to God will do that.
[00:32:28.014 --> 00:32:28.375]  Stay with us.
[00:32:30.026 --> 00:32:39.770]  So, everyone continues to ask me on the street, everywhere I go, I had some police ask me about this yesterday, how do you keep knowing what's going to happen next exactly how it happens?
[00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.190]  And I'm going to demystify that.
[00:32:42.851 --> 00:32:51.534]  The globalists thinly veil everything they do in CFR, in Bilderberg, in Davos, in Club of Rome, in UN statements.
[00:32:52.214 --> 00:32:57.396]  And they put out why they're doing and what they're going to do, but then in their internal publications that are public,
[00:32:58.473 --> 00:32:58.953]  We're good to go.
[00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:23.610]  He's written a book on that.
[00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:33.937]  We can show you what they put out three years ago called The Great Reset, which they now announce COVID-19 is The Great Reset, where you own nothing, you have nothing, you live in a 250 square foot jail cell.
[00:33:34.397 --> 00:33:36.159]  They call this all a lockdown.
[00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:40.381]  And he says the lockdown will never end.
[00:33:41.582 --> 00:33:42.843]  They're just habituating you.
[00:33:42.883 --> 00:33:46.005]  And they know that after about a year or something, most people habituate.
[00:33:47.106 --> 00:33:50.809]  Even those that oppose it, they will start getting mad at you for not habituating.
[00:33:51.698 --> 00:33:53.540]  And they're going to say, well, you didn't accept the lockdown.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.401]  You left your house.
[00:33:54.761 --> 00:33:56.302]  You're the reason it had to be put back in.
[00:33:56.322 --> 00:34:02.468]  It doesn't matter if they're doing 10 times the COVID testing they were doing a month ago and 10 times the month before that.
[00:34:02.488 --> 00:34:03.089]  The U.S.
[00:34:03.129 --> 00:34:04.250]  has done more than anybody in the world.
[00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:12.237]  They go, oh, a million infections in Texas, but only a few thousand dead since they announced a million infections.
[00:34:12.558 --> 00:34:16.662]  It's like saying there's a million infections of mosquito bites, but who died?
[00:34:17.694 --> 00:34:20.525]  And now they go, oh, the dark winter's here because they're going to count the flu.
[00:34:20.545 --> 00:34:22.674]  They're going to count the colds.
[00:34:24.005 --> 00:34:38.639]  What's incredible is it's all admitted, but then Schwab admits what the real reason for all of this is, and he says the Great Reset to help the third world, and to help us not use so much carbon, and to give you a universal income.
[00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:49.849]  Now, how is destroying the world economy, potentially starving hundreds of millions to death, millions have already died, the UN admits, from their own operation, how is that a Great Reset saving us?
[00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:50.650]  It's all double thing.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.800]  It's the population.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:35:08.905]  When the third world collapses, in his own new book, COVID-19 and the Great Reset, and the three-year report on the Great Reset three years ago, they say the third world's gonna collapse soon from climate change and diseases that'll be caused by climate change.
[00:35:09.386 --> 00:35:10.206]  Those are quotes in there.
[00:35:11.391 --> 00:35:13.032]  It's not climate change doing its own voodoo.
[00:35:13.472 --> 00:35:18.496]  Then they collapse those people, giving them no businesses, no jobs with us, shutting the economies down.
[00:35:18.836 --> 00:35:25.720]  They then flood us and the UN organizes and controls the migrant flood, organizes and controls the new global
[00:35:26.781 --> 00:35:34.963]  Marshall Plan, they're calling it, to reorganize the planet under the mega banks and make you sign over all your assets to them so they can control you.
[00:35:35.264 --> 00:35:37.184]  That's all in the white papers.
[00:35:37.904 --> 00:35:46.447]  And even Archbishop has read the reports and come out and said this is a health dictatorship and it's communism of the ultra-rich to enslave you and your family.
[00:35:46.667 --> 00:35:47.627]  You gotta go read the article.
[00:35:49.148 --> 00:35:52.388]  Archbishop Warren's open letter to Trump warning of COVID health dictatorship.
[00:35:52.448 --> 00:35:53.249]  That's what it is.
[00:35:53.429 --> 00:35:54.089]  See, here's what's crazy.
[00:35:55.418 --> 00:35:56.979]  They're telling you what they're doing.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.782]  Lenin and Stalin told you what they do.
[00:36:00.822 --> 00:36:01.222]  They did it.
[00:36:01.322 --> 00:36:09.629]  Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in the late 20s and did everything he said he would do.
[00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.112]  They're telling you now what they're going to do.
[00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:20.136]  That's why Ezekiel Emanuel that wrote Obamacare has come out and said, we're going to kill people at 75.
[00:36:21.197 --> 00:36:22.118]  We're getting rid of your health care.
[00:36:24.294 --> 00:36:25.195]  They're telling you this.
[00:36:25.215 --> 00:36:36.905]  So when I tell you they're setting up world government, total surveillance, eight months ago, to go to college or have a job, you'll have an app on your phone, you'll be tested daily by a quack computer machine that they can rig anytime they want.
[00:36:37.405 --> 00:36:40.087]  Now Ticketmaster's saying, you want to go to a concert, you've got to do it.
[00:36:40.408 --> 00:36:44.271]  Now, it was one university six months ago, now hundreds of universities in the U.S.
[00:36:44.531 --> 00:36:49.095]  say you've got to have all the vaccines and have a scan and have your temperature taken every day.
[00:36:49.475 --> 00:36:50.896]  It's a medical tyranny.
[00:36:51.136 --> 00:36:52.418]  And Klaus Schwab says
[00:36:53.638 --> 00:36:59.944]  In the article in InfoWars with links to his book and his quotes, he says, COVID-19 is inconsequential.
[00:37:00.044 --> 00:37:00.925]  It's only the trigger.
[00:37:01.426 --> 00:37:02.447]  It's not even a big threat.
[00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:04.909]  He wants to brag about that.
[00:37:04.949 --> 00:37:05.910]  So let me give you the big news.
[00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:09.013]  God gave you free will.
[00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:16.961]  And if you put pressure on your governors, even if we lose Trump, and if you put pressure on local governments, and if you don't wear a mask, and if you argue with people,
[00:37:18.939 --> 00:37:21.540]  And if you say no and educate them, we can defeat this.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.701]  But if you comply and go, Alex, just wear your mask a few weeks, it'll be over in a few weeks.
[00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:27.002]  It's never gonna end.
[00:37:27.282 --> 00:37:29.603]  The mask is the induction in the eugenics cult.
[00:37:30.283 --> 00:37:37.245]  The mask, they admit, is the symbol of your subservience and that humans are dirty, humans are bad for the earth, humans are bad for other humans.
[00:37:37.705 --> 00:37:39.306]  We have to cover ourselves in shame.
[00:37:40.006 --> 00:37:44.288]  And then get bacterial infections that caused 80 plus percent of the Spanish flu.
[00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:46.688]  Death was not from flu of the 50 million dead.
[00:37:46.768 --> 00:37:49.909]  It was from the mask everyone hysterically began wearing.
[00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.010]  So it was a sick joke they've come out with this.
[00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.931]  That's why they're finding these nurses they say have died of COVID.
[00:37:55.371 --> 00:37:56.952]  Of course they're in there around it all day.
[00:37:56.972 --> 00:37:57.992]  They've got antibodies for it.
[00:37:58.572 --> 00:38:00.353]  97% of people are asymptomatic.
[00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:02.874]  Others might get a little bit of a headache or something.
[00:38:03.854 --> 00:38:06.455]  If you don't have enough vitamins and minerals, you might die.
[00:38:06.875 --> 00:38:08.596]  You'll die of any virus that way.
[00:38:10.094 --> 00:38:14.936]  But you notice, you read about these nurses that died, and you'll later learn they had a bacterial infection from their mask.
[00:38:15.896 --> 00:38:19.497]  And that they love them like a binky, and they never change it or clean it, it's all filthy.
[00:38:20.258 --> 00:38:22.098]  And people get, they get where they love their filth.
[00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:23.959]  They love wearing their dirty diapers.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.941]  And so, we saw the head of the Palestinian Negotiating Authority die.
[00:38:29.521 --> 00:38:31.702]  Said he died of COVID at 66 or whatever.
[00:38:33.479 --> 00:38:34.019]  I looked it up.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.942]  I thought, I bet that guy had cancer or liver failure or lung cancer.
[00:38:37.022 --> 00:38:38.263]  Sorry, he had worse than that.
[00:38:38.363 --> 00:38:39.764]  Both lungs had been removed.
[00:38:40.645 --> 00:38:45.229]  He'd had a lung transplant separate from COVID and died of complications of a lung transplant.
[00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:47.631]  That's right.
[00:38:48.091 --> 00:38:56.418]  He died of a lung transplant complication he had several years ago and had been in the hospital off and on for three years.
[00:38:58.114 --> 00:39:03.857]  You hear about, oh, a baby died, a six-month-old baby, born with a disease with a deformity where the intestines are outside the body.
[00:39:04.398 --> 00:39:05.598]  Another baby died in L.A.
[00:39:05.778 --> 00:39:09.060]  Turned out the baby was born without an activated heart.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.121]  It only had, like, two of the chambers.
[00:39:12.782 --> 00:39:14.143]  And they couldn't get a heart transplant.
[00:39:14.283 --> 00:39:15.144]  Didn't die of COVID.
[00:39:15.464 --> 00:39:16.104]  You know this.
[00:39:16.244 --> 00:39:16.864]  You know the fraud.
[00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:20.366]  So don't put up with it, because this is permanent martial law.
[00:39:20.787 --> 00:39:22.728]  And you notice Joe Biden saying he's president-elect.
[00:39:24.353 --> 00:39:26.135]  This is never going to end.
[00:39:26.455 --> 00:39:28.077]  This is never going to stop.
[00:39:28.397 --> 00:39:29.578]  This is never going to go away.
[00:39:29.638 --> 00:39:30.939]  He's going to listen to the scientists.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:39.507]  Not the thousands of doctors, epidemiologists, and scientists that have come out and said it's overblown, it's hype, most of the deaths are caused by the dirty mask, or it's caused by other deaths.
[00:39:39.747 --> 00:39:40.308]  Here's the evidence.
[00:39:40.328 --> 00:39:43.471]  They're all being banned and censored by the big globalist authoritarian takeover.
[00:39:45.112 --> 00:39:47.635]  No, ladies and gentlemen, that's not what's going on here.
[00:39:49.574 --> 00:39:50.515]  It's not about science.
[00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:51.455]  It's about a fraud.
[00:39:51.495 --> 00:39:52.856]  It's about not believing science.
[00:39:53.136 --> 00:39:58.960]  They told us all the oceans would have already flooded the cities by 2017, but the sea levels haven't gone up.
[00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:03.622]  And they now admit this is about global warming, the Great Reset.
[00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:11.227]  We're using COVID to get the global warming systems in charge that we wanted to track and trace all carbon and track and trace all humans.
[00:40:12.566 --> 00:40:16.970]  And now they're going to do it through your face scan and through your COVID tracking app.
[00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:19.152]  You've had all your vaccines and you're not sick.
[00:40:19.712 --> 00:40:20.833]  But they're not normal vaccines.
[00:40:20.853 --> 00:40:23.355]  They're mRNA vaccines that make you very sick.
[00:40:23.655 --> 00:40:26.598]  That's why Trump's coming out with a Pfizer one that's a placebo.
[00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:28.660]  I wouldn't take it, but I get what Trump's doing.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.262]  Taking the debate away from them, saying, we can reopen.
[00:40:31.682 --> 00:40:32.523]  We have a vaccine.
[00:40:32.743 --> 00:40:34.104]  And Cuomo goes, no vaccine.
[00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:35.806]  No, you will never reopen.
[00:40:36.226 --> 00:40:37.227]  Only Bill Gates' vaccine.
[00:40:37.607 --> 00:40:39.649]  Even when you have Bill Gates' vaccine, you don't reopen.
[00:40:40.879 --> 00:40:45.122]  Now we have huge breaking news that I'm going to cover as soon as we start the next hour.
[00:40:45.162 --> 00:40:45.922]  Trump has just tweeted this.
[00:40:45.942 --> 00:40:47.103]  We're getting the video from OAN.
[00:40:47.183 --> 00:40:49.264]  It's being posted at Infowars.com.
[00:40:49.304 --> 00:40:53.347]  Report, Dominion deleted 2.7 million Trump votes nationwide.
[00:40:53.767 --> 00:40:59.531]  Data analysis finds 221,000 Pennsylvania votes switched from President Trump to Biden.
[00:40:59.851 --> 00:41:00.811]  941,000 Trump votes deleted.
[00:41:01.312 --> 00:41:04.454]  States using Dominion voting system switched 435,000 votes from Trump to Biden.
[00:41:08.106 --> 00:41:14.831]  And that is what they've got from the preliminary audits and what they're doing looking at the damn records that are computerized.
[00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:18.793]  They stole this bigger than Dallas in front of everybody.
[00:41:19.154 --> 00:41:27.879]  But hey, if you catch somebody in your house with the safe or in your house with the computers or in your house with the silverware and the family heirlooms,
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.442]  You have a right to take it back?
[00:41:30.682 --> 00:41:32.124]  Damn right you do.
[00:41:32.784 --> 00:41:34.346]  And so they are panicking.
[00:41:34.366 --> 00:41:36.828]  They're saying have a coup against Trump all over the news.
[00:41:37.129 --> 00:41:42.774]  They're saying he's insane, he's crazy, because he's not going to let them have this fifth attempted coup against us separately.
[00:41:44.096 --> 00:41:46.759]  You've got my commitment to burn the candle at both ends here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:47.625 --> 00:41:48.646]  And we're fighting hard here.
[00:41:48.666 --> 00:41:51.148]  We need your financial support at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:53.450]  Bringing a caravan up here and flying here with the crew and all.
[00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:53.871]  We love you.
[00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:54.391]  We appreciate you.
[00:41:54.751 --> 00:41:55.792]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:41:56.032 --> 00:41:59.035]  We have the Stop the Steal, Stop Lockdown 2 emergency sale.
[00:41:59.415 --> 00:42:00.817]  We're just trying to sell it to everything.
[00:42:00.837 --> 00:42:02.899]  Storewide free shipping, triple patriot points.

[00:42:13.601 --> 00:42:15.562]  You know what Bill Gates said about the real thing coming?
[00:42:15.982 --> 00:42:20.003]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:20.023 --> 00:42:20.243]  888-253-3139.
[00:42:20.423 --> 00:42:24.724]  And boy, you kept us on the air for this point.
[00:42:25.004 --> 00:42:28.144]  When everything we warned you about was coming, we were reading the enemy's own documents.
[00:42:28.164 --> 00:42:28.524]  Amazing.
[00:42:28.785 --> 00:42:30.425]  I'll have all this new Dominion news.
[00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:39.308]  As the whistleblowers go public, as the numbers destroy Biden, as the media goes into connection fits, and so much more, next hour, minutes away, you are the Paul Revere's.
[00:42:39.348 --> 00:42:40.028]  I salute you all.
[00:42:40.188 --> 00:42:41.169]  Tell folks to tune in now.
[00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:44.730]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.811]  Don't let them win.
[00:42:46.211 --> 00:42:50.993]  Go to our emergency election newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:42:51.253 --> 00:42:54.794]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[00:42:55.154 --> 00:42:57.455]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:42:57.635 --> 00:43:00.076]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.222]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here in our number two.
[00:43:04.322 --> 00:43:06.624]  Incredible things are unfolding.
[00:43:07.404 --> 00:43:09.646]  Massive election fraud is coming out.
[00:43:11.267 --> 00:43:12.388]  Major whistleblowers.
[00:43:13.088 --> 00:43:14.229]  Massive information.
[00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:26.277]  And the controlled gatekeepers, or not even media, big tech and the enemy of America, mainstream media, is trying to block all of this as fast as they can.
[00:43:27.447 --> 00:43:35.511]  Trump is coming out with reports over 2 million votes by Dominion Loan Software flipped with major OAN report set to break.
[00:43:35.551 --> 00:43:40.393]  As soon as we have that, we will be getting into all that.
[00:43:40.413 --> 00:43:41.854]  I want to play clip one first, though.
[00:43:42.654 --> 00:43:50.497]  This is Mayor de Blasio's daughter in verbal slip up, claims Biden was able to steal the election.
[00:43:51.638 --> 00:43:52.258]  Think about that.
[00:43:52.318 --> 00:43:53.779]  Let's go ahead and play clip one.
[00:43:56.394 --> 00:43:58.075]  Why do you think this is so stuffy?
[00:43:58.175 --> 00:43:59.956]  Why don't you guys have a talk?
[00:43:59.976 --> 00:44:11.381]  Well, for me it's really special because now we have the first black Asian female president in office, elected, and Joe Biden was able to steal, steal now, he was able to win!
[00:44:11.602 --> 00:44:12.002]  Sorry, sorry.
[00:44:12.862 --> 00:44:16.484]  But what was the story here?
[00:44:16.564 --> 00:44:19.385]  No, we were able to win the election.
[00:44:19.646 --> 00:44:21.246]  But what was the story important here?
[00:44:21.266 --> 00:44:21.326]  Yes.
[00:44:21.386 --> 00:44:24.228]  What does it mean to you as a woman?
[00:44:26.738 --> 00:44:30.422]  So that's the mayor of New York's daughter sitting there able to steal the election from President Trump.
[00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:35.947]  I'm sure Twitter will block that or something probably too to cover up.
[00:44:35.967 --> 00:44:37.409]  This is just a giant criminal operation.
[00:44:37.909 --> 00:44:38.690]  Here's clip 7.
[00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:42.434]  President Trump predicts election chaos by Democrats.
[00:44:42.494 --> 00:44:42.935]  Remember that?
[00:44:42.995 --> 00:44:46.278]  He kept predicting it with the mail-in ballots and the scams they were running.
[00:44:46.558 --> 00:44:49.141]  Here's President Trump predicting what happened.
[00:44:50.267 --> 00:44:57.053]  Will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?
[00:44:57.694 --> 00:44:58.815]  President Trump, you go first.
[00:44:58.835 --> 00:45:05.200]  I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen.
[00:45:05.381 --> 00:45:06.742]  I am urging them to do it.
[00:45:07.262 --> 00:45:09.123]  As you know, today there was a big problem.
[00:45:09.224 --> 00:45:11.185]  In Philadelphia, they went in to watch.
[00:45:11.225 --> 00:45:12.786]  They were called poll watchers.
[00:45:12.826 --> 00:45:14.407]  A very safe, very nice thing.
[00:45:14.727 --> 00:45:15.708]  They were thrown out.
[00:45:15.828 --> 00:45:16.969]  They weren't allowed to watch.
[00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.809]  You know why?
[00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:20.131]  Because bad things happen in Philadelphia.
[00:45:20.211 --> 00:45:20.852]  Bad things.
[00:45:21.312 --> 00:45:24.054]  And I am urging, I am urging my people.
[00:45:24.134 --> 00:45:25.575]  I hope it's going to be a fair election.
[00:45:25.615 --> 00:45:28.817]  If it's a fair election, I am 100% on board.
[00:45:29.117 --> 00:45:34.381]  But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that.
[00:45:34.721 --> 00:45:35.362]  And I'll tell you what.
[00:45:36.503 --> 00:45:37.984]  I'll tell you what it means.
[00:45:38.064 --> 00:45:40.126]  It means you have a fraudulent election.
[00:45:40.526 --> 00:45:42.268]  You're sending out 80 million ballots.
[00:45:42.288 --> 00:45:44.170]  They're not equipped to handle it.
[00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.332]  These people aren't equipped to handle it, number one.
[00:45:46.652 --> 00:45:47.853]  Number two, they cheat.
[00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:48.954]  They cheat.
[00:45:49.214 --> 00:45:55.980]  Hey, they found ballots in a waste paper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:56.701]  They were military.
[00:45:56.981 --> 00:45:58.523]  They all had the name Trump on them.
[00:45:59.023 --> 00:46:02.188]  Vice President Biden, final question for you.
[00:46:02.269 --> 00:46:11.844]  Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted and will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?
[00:46:11.984 --> 00:46:12.264]  Yes.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:35.318]  So, you heard Biden say he wouldn't do it until it was independently certified, it's not been certified by the states, there are legal challenges, it's completely normal, and there's mountains of fraud, mountains of evidence, and so that's why they froze it when Trump was winning, waited until they could flood in all the ballots they had cached, and now they don't want those looked at, because everywhere they're looked at, they're fraudulent.
[00:46:36.159 --> 00:46:40.403]  And the head Georgia officials have said, okay, we went and looked at the documents, we went and looked at it, a lot of these are fake.
[00:46:41.485 --> 00:46:45.748]  Of course, they pumped out 80 million of these to dead cats, dead dogs, dead people.
[00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:54.915]  And I personally know folks that won't come on air, who've lived in other states, who voted in those states even though they didn't.
[00:46:55.075 --> 00:47:02.080]  And then you've seen us show the documents for people that I have associates that know, and they've gone public where it happened in California.
[00:47:03.401 --> 00:47:04.162]  And she's a Republican.
[00:47:05.723 --> 00:47:09.185]  But she lived in California, she moved here, and now she's going to be voting in California forever.
[00:47:09.205 --> 00:47:09.606]  They don't care.
[00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:14.217]  Because it's a criminal takeover.
[00:47:15.198 --> 00:47:16.301]  They're not held accountable.
[00:47:17.674 --> 00:47:20.296]  And so they can get away with whatever they want, whenever they want, they believe.
[00:47:20.316 --> 00:47:22.077]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:22.097 --> 00:47:28.961]  We've got huge breaking news on the election fraud front and what Trump just tweeted about and what came out with Dominion Software and more.
[00:47:29.622 --> 00:47:34.965]  And I've got the big overarching story about them announcing global lockdown too, which is permanent.
[00:47:35.325 --> 00:47:36.586]  It's going to be just constantly going.
[00:47:36.606 --> 00:47:37.307]  It's never going to end now.
[00:47:37.987 --> 00:47:38.968]  And why they bet they're doing it.
[00:47:38.988 --> 00:47:39.988]  They say to bankrupt the planet.
[00:47:40.649 --> 00:47:43.531]  Well, I liken this fight against the globalists as a long race.
[00:47:44.724 --> 00:47:45.764]  Like a NASCAR race.
[00:47:45.984 --> 00:47:47.405]  And I'm not scared to race.
[00:47:47.485 --> 00:47:51.526]  I tend to over-rev my engine and get a little upset because things are so incredibly serious.
[00:47:51.566 --> 00:47:52.047]  Welcome back.
[00:47:52.067 --> 00:47:53.987]  I want to thank you all for joining us today.
[00:47:56.568 --> 00:47:58.489]  There are two big issues that are all intertwined.
[00:47:59.809 --> 00:48:03.211]  There is a global corporate takeover of the entire planet taking place.
[00:48:04.411 --> 00:48:08.132]  And these billionaires are very predatory and very anti-human and very evil.
[00:48:08.933 --> 00:48:12.514]  But they sell their authoritarianism to their underlings that they're saving the earth.
[00:48:13.342 --> 00:48:19.006]  And so they trained the leftist oppressive censors and eugenicists that this is an emergency.
[00:48:19.046 --> 00:48:20.487]  We're very sad we have to do it.
[00:48:21.328 --> 00:48:26.092]  We have to establish world government and depopulate the planet to save the earth.
[00:48:27.693 --> 00:48:32.437]  They even had congressional hearings back in the 70s with Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
[00:48:32.497 --> 00:48:41.604]  and so many others admitting that they're bringing in a world government and that a lot of folks that are going to fight them are very gallant and mean well.
[00:48:42.914 --> 00:48:51.078]  But, that's a word they use gallant, but that we just aren't willing to make the hard decisions to save the Earth.
[00:48:52.258 --> 00:48:56.641]  Now let's just take that on face value, that they're saving the Earth.
[00:48:57.121 --> 00:49:00.562]  David Rockefeller and Bill Gates and all these people.
[00:49:01.703 --> 00:49:03.204]  And then you study who they are and what they do.
[00:49:03.244 --> 00:49:12.228]  They're horrible, they're cunning, they're greedy, they're hateful, and their ancestors are literal proto-Nazis.
[00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:16.451]  I mean, the Nazis came out of the Rockefellers on record.
[00:49:18.112 --> 00:49:19.533]  And again, this is not a Nazi conspiracy.
[00:49:20.653 --> 00:49:21.934]  This is a eugenics conspiracy.
[00:49:21.954 --> 00:49:23.155]  This is a world government conspiracy.
[00:49:27.377 --> 00:49:29.077]  And I know their plan.
[00:49:29.117 --> 00:49:30.198]  Their damn plan's public.
[00:49:30.298 --> 00:49:36.341]  I've been studying it for 35 years without even knowing it.
[00:49:38.257 --> 00:49:41.739]  Because my dad had history books and geopolitical books all over the house.
[00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:45.621]  And I remember looking at the covers when I was 2, 3, 4 years old and wanting to know what they were.
[00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:50.523]  When I got old enough to read, and I've always been a good reader, I began reading these things before I even knew what they were.
[00:49:50.543 --> 00:49:57.647]  I was like reading Nietzsche when I was like 8, trying to figure out what the spake meant.
[00:49:58.827 --> 00:50:01.949]  Or what staring into the abyss too long, be careful you don't become the abyss.
[00:50:03.448 --> 00:50:12.616]  And then reading, you know, again, the works of everything from Julius Caesar to Adolf Hitler to Winston Churchill, the history of the English-speaking peoples.
[00:50:12.696 --> 00:50:18.241]  And I read a three-part series on the rise in history and life of LBJ.
[00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:20.503]  I mean, I read all that before 20 years old.
[00:50:21.584 --> 00:50:22.665]  I'm not bragging about it.
[00:50:23.686 --> 00:50:25.948]  I was blessed that I just fell into that.
[00:50:26.688 --> 00:50:28.810]  And I'm here telling you what's going on.
[00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:30.792]  And you can check any of this.
[00:50:34.352 --> 00:50:36.794]  And you can do something about it.
[00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:38.176]  You don't have to be destroyed.
[00:50:41.159 --> 00:50:46.023]  But at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get into the big picture and the big plan on how to stop it.
[00:50:46.884 --> 00:50:49.367]  Or at least how to have a controlled crash landing.
[00:50:50.401 --> 00:50:55.243]  Because God is in control and God has a destiny for us, but we can also choose part of our destiny.
[00:50:55.603 --> 00:50:57.164]  So I liken it to those books they had.
[00:50:57.444 --> 00:50:58.965]  They still have them, like Choose Your Own Adventure.
[00:50:59.405 --> 00:51:01.906]  They might have three outcomes, four outcomes, five outcomes.
[00:51:02.506 --> 00:51:04.767]  They all kind of go in a general same direction.
[00:51:06.088 --> 00:51:10.069]  Because God already knows how things are going to unfold at every possible destination.
[00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:18.073]  But God's given us a consciousness of the will to make a decision how we want to go through that obstacle course.
[00:51:19.312 --> 00:51:20.493]  And that's really what this is.
[00:51:20.593 --> 00:51:27.520]  And there is a supreme being, there is an advanced intelligence, about anything we can even comprehend that is beyond anything these globalists can imagine.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:33.125]  It's not even comparable to even put them in the same league of a league of a league of a league.
[00:51:34.407 --> 00:51:37.450]  God is infinite dimensions, infinite consciousness, omnipresence.
[00:51:39.401 --> 00:51:41.122]  And the globalists want to play God.
[00:51:41.162 --> 00:52:06.298]  They want to take our free will, to have a phone that tracks and controls us, and social credit scores, to turn us into robots in patented plans, where every action we make, every move we make, if we make the move properly, and it starts with six feet apart, wearing the mask, taking the inoculation, going to the re-education training systems, going out and persecuting others, tattling on people, sterilizing ourselves, sterilizing our children.
[00:52:07.611 --> 00:52:13.275]  As we go through all those little moves, we are becoming robots ourselves.
[00:52:14.456 --> 00:52:15.316]  We must oppose that.
[00:52:17.497 --> 00:52:18.418]  Let's first get into this.
[00:52:18.438 --> 00:52:21.040]  There's a big report out by Lou Dobbs we prepared last hour.
[00:52:23.121 --> 00:52:28.545]  It's at Infowars.com and it's absolutely essential.
[00:52:30.319 --> 00:52:40.507]  You go watch it, and it's a whistleblower about Dominion Software and about what the Democrats were doing and how they were flipping everything in Michigan and all these other whistleblowers that have come out.
[00:52:41.868 --> 00:52:49.394]  We'll be getting more of that, but Trump has come out in a tweet talking about even more information coming out about Dominion Software that's being focused on.
[00:52:50.575 --> 00:52:51.856]  But Staple Street's just as bad.
[00:52:53.356 --> 00:52:53.896]  Maybe worse.
[00:52:54.976 --> 00:53:03.718]  And what they're doing and how two plus million votes they're confirming have been flipped from Trump to Biden in the battleground states.
[00:53:04.138 --> 00:53:05.539]  They've caught them red handed.
[00:53:06.219 --> 00:53:08.339]  That's why they did months and months of early voting.
[00:53:08.779 --> 00:53:11.700]  It's why they then had to wait because they still lost to bring in what they needed.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:18.041]  They have had months and months and months to steal this, but they had to use their own minions to do it like everything they do.
[00:53:18.441 --> 00:53:19.401]  It's badly coordinated.
[00:53:19.441 --> 00:53:22.382]  I mean, Joe Biden can barely even talk.
[00:53:23.786 --> 00:53:25.447]  He's emblematic of slaves of Satan.
[00:53:25.988 --> 00:53:26.628]  They're nobodies.
[00:53:27.309 --> 00:53:29.350]  You think you get worldly power, but you're a husk.
[00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:32.853]  You're an empty shell, like a cicada husk or a snakeskin.
[00:53:33.414 --> 00:53:35.275]  When you serve Satan, God empowers you.
[00:53:35.315 --> 00:53:36.176]  God builds you.
[00:53:36.216 --> 00:53:43.261]  God gives you everything good and gives you discernment and gives you genesis, gives you birth, gives you life, gives you death, gives you rebirth.
[00:53:43.942 --> 00:53:46.764]  The devil gives you nothing but being a slave and taking your free will.
[00:53:47.745 --> 00:53:48.626]  So Tucker Carlson,
[00:53:49.778 --> 00:53:51.339]  Last night got into election fraud.
[00:53:52.119 --> 00:53:55.201]  So I want to go to break into some of this and come back and play those other clubs I've talked about.
[00:53:56.041 --> 00:54:01.625]  But here's Tucker Carlson talking about the phenomenon of just in Michigan, thousands of dead people voting right there.
[00:54:01.825 --> 00:54:04.246]  Oh, and guess who they all voted for by accident?
[00:54:04.946 --> 00:54:05.867]  You guessed it, Joe Biden.
[00:54:05.907 --> 00:54:06.527]  Here's Tucker Carlson.
[00:54:07.368 --> 00:54:08.628]  Nations could prove it too.
[00:54:09.229 --> 00:54:10.509]  They've simply chosen not to.
[00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:14.472]  The position of corporate media across the country this week has been very simple.
[00:54:14.872 --> 00:54:16.513]  There was no voter fraud.
[00:54:17.403 --> 00:54:22.610]  The New York Times, once the paper of record, declared that as fact this morning across the entire front page.
[00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:23.552]  Look at this banner headline.
[00:54:24.313 --> 00:54:27.577]  Election officials nationwide find no fraud.
[00:54:28.419 --> 00:54:28.899]  No fraud.
[00:54:28.979 --> 00:54:29.200]  None.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:29.941]  End of story.
[00:54:30.081 --> 00:54:31.904]  Move on and listen to Kamala.
[00:54:33.151 --> 00:54:36.194]  You're hearing virtually the same thing from everyone in the media.
[00:54:36.494 --> 00:54:36.954]  Everyone.
[00:54:37.575 --> 00:54:41.138]  At CNN, the anchors have been repeating the approved message for days.
[00:54:41.719 --> 00:54:49.746]  They say it with a kind of brittle intensity that suggests, precisely because they don't really believe what they're saying, you absolutely must believe it.
[00:54:50.366 --> 00:54:52.248]  Shut up and accept the verdict, America.
[00:54:53.908 --> 00:55:02.152]  Sources tell CNN that top aides are suggesting that the defeated President, President Trump, hold rallies to drum up bogus conspiracies about election fraud.
[00:55:02.192 --> 00:55:06.474]  The GOP keeps spreading completely unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.
[00:55:06.554 --> 00:55:12.297]  The Attorney General now telling federal prosecutors to look into those unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.
[00:55:12.377 --> 00:55:14.918]  There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud.
[00:55:15.518 --> 00:55:18.360]  No evidence of widespread flaws in the mail-in voting process.
[00:55:19.841 --> 00:55:21.529]  Bogus conspiracy theories!
[00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:24.884]  Completely unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud!
[00:55:25.967 --> 00:55:29.108]  They say it again and again, but what exactly are they talking about?
[00:55:29.788 --> 00:55:31.829]  They won't tell you, so we're going to tell you.
[00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:37.551]  Right now, fewer than 15,000 votes separate Donald Trump from Joe Biden in the state of Georgia.
[00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:41.452]  It's close enough that it's worth getting specific about what happened there.
[00:55:41.892 --> 00:55:47.174]  And Georgia's Secretary of State has now confirmed there will be a hand recount of all votes cast in Georgia.
[00:55:47.894 --> 00:55:52.616]  Among those votes, auditors will find a ballot cast by a woman called Deborah Jean Christensen.
[00:55:53.536 --> 00:55:57.598]  It'd be hard to find anyone who's got a bad word to say about Debra Jean Christensen.
[00:55:57.638 --> 00:56:03.821]  She was well known in her community for years as a bird watcher, an avid gardener, a committed fan of the Georgia Bulldogs.
[00:56:04.481 --> 00:56:16.627]  Those who knew her were sad when she died last May, and they might be surprised to learn that even after her death, Debra Jean Christensen still managed to register to vote and then cast a ballot, presumably for Joe Biden.
[00:56:17.267 --> 00:56:19.388]  In some ways, it's an inspiring story.
[00:56:19.728 --> 00:56:21.529]  The triumph of voting over death.
[00:56:22.574 --> 00:56:26.736]  And no one quite embodies that story like James Blaylock of Covington, Georgia.
[00:56:27.277 --> 00:56:31.119]  Mr. Blaylock was a mailman for 33 years until he passed away in 2006.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.942]  14 years later, according to state records, he was still mailing things.
[00:56:36.582 --> 00:56:39.124]  James Blaylock cast a ballot in last week's election.
[00:56:39.764 --> 00:56:40.664]  How did he do that?
[00:56:41.285 --> 00:56:43.146]  It might be worth asking the New York Times.
[00:56:43.686 --> 00:56:46.987]  Maybe James Blaylock was just one of those extraordinary mail carriers.
[00:56:47.307 --> 00:56:53.130]  Neither rain, nor snow, nor gloom of night, nor even death itself could keep him from the mail.
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.622]  In his case, maybe voting for the grave wasn't really fraud, it was just commitment.
[00:56:58.082 --> 00:56:59.563]  Alright folks, this is very important.
[00:56:59.603 --> 00:57:07.568]  But you notice, even our story, with the woman's name, with the documents about how she lives in Texas as a Republican, but voted for Biden in California, that doesn't even get picked up.
[00:57:07.988 --> 00:57:09.629]  We're not seeing one one-millionth of the truth.
[00:57:10.289 --> 00:57:11.290]  It's much, much bigger.
[00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:12.390]  It's much, much worse.
[00:57:12.611 --> 00:57:13.771]  But there's a path to victory.
[00:57:14.011 --> 00:57:17.453]  It's called whistleblowers, and it's called standing firm, and President Trump's doing it.
[00:57:17.894 --> 00:57:23.277]  When you're backed up by the megabanks, when you're backed up by the globalists, when you're backed up by the mainstream media, you get very, very arrogant.
[00:57:23.877 --> 00:57:27.421]  It's why Joe Biden said, yeah, we've got the biggest organization ever to steal the election.
[00:57:27.441 --> 00:57:28.442]  We're going to win no matter what.
[00:57:28.782 --> 00:57:31.025]  Plus, he said, we don't care what happens next week with this thing.
[00:57:31.425 --> 00:57:32.527]  He will be inaugurated.
[00:57:33.488 --> 00:57:41.597]  But even the little goblin-like daughter of the demon, Kami de Blasio, just bragged on TV that, hey, Biden was able to steal it.
[00:57:42.077 --> 00:57:42.438]  Here it is.
[00:57:44.099 --> 00:57:46.720]  Why do you think this is so special?
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.600]  Why are you guys having so much fun?
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:58:00.462]  Well, for me, it's really special because now we have the first black Asian female president in office, elected, and Joe Biden was able to steal, steal now!
[00:58:00.562 --> 00:58:02.503]  He was able to win!
[00:58:02.523 --> 00:58:03.623]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:58:03.643 --> 00:58:05.543]  I thought we had a new story here.
[00:58:05.563 --> 00:58:08.004]  No, we were able to win the election for America.
[00:58:08.024 --> 00:58:10.264]  I thought America was very important to you.
[00:58:10.324 --> 00:58:10.424]  Yes.
[00:58:10.504 --> 00:58:12.865]  First president needs to be able to win.
[00:58:14.787 --> 00:58:18.512]  So it doesn't matter that Kamala Harris polled less than 1.5% with Democrats.
[00:58:18.532 --> 00:58:22.217]  It doesn't matter that her family were slave owners recently in Jamaica.
[00:58:22.237 --> 00:58:30.368]  It doesn't matter if she, like, through the book of black people, gave three times the sentences of white folks and agreed with Joe Biden that black men are super predators.
[00:58:31.934 --> 00:58:33.675]  Oh, she's part Indian and part black.
[00:58:34.335 --> 00:58:37.196]  And so we gotta bow down to her and just do whatever she says.
[00:58:37.236 --> 00:58:38.796]  This is so sick.
[00:58:38.836 --> 00:58:45.639]  It's about identity politics, the opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about, where you judge people on what they stand for and what they do, which makes sense to me.
[00:58:46.119 --> 00:58:47.539]  I don't judge folks about what color they are.
[00:58:47.559 --> 00:58:50.560]  I judge them off what they stand for, what they produce, what they do.
[00:58:52.001 --> 00:58:52.941]  But let's just shift gears.
[00:58:53.401 --> 00:59:01.024]  I don't usually play a clip twice in one show, but it's Trump, months ago, in one of the debates, first debate.
[00:59:02.079 --> 00:59:02.662]  Chris Wallace.
[00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:07.182]  And you've got Biden saying, you know, I will not.
[00:59:08.612 --> 00:59:09.933]  Let Trump declare victory early.
[00:59:10.033 --> 00:59:11.494]  I want it independently certified.
[00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.376]  I want the states to certify it.
[00:59:13.496 --> 00:59:14.376]  All the legal challenges.
[00:59:14.957 --> 00:59:17.839]  So here they are thinking they'd have to, you know, steal it way down the line.
[00:59:18.579 --> 00:59:21.321]  And that Trump would have such a landslide up front that they couldn't defeat it.
[00:59:21.922 --> 00:59:27.226]  But they stole so much that they only had to freeze five states the night of the event to then bring in the extra votes.
[00:59:27.266 --> 00:59:33.390]  So they stole so good, their wall of fraud was so huge that it wasn't as bad as they thought.
[00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:36.312]  So then now they're hoping you don't look at their earlier words.
[00:59:36.533 --> 00:59:36.853]  Here it is.
[00:59:38.203 --> 00:59:45.005]  Will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?
[00:59:45.626 --> 00:59:46.746]  President Trump, you go first.
[00:59:46.766 --> 00:59:53.128]  I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen.
[00:59:53.308 --> 00:59:54.689]  I am urging them to do it.
[00:59:55.209 --> 00:59:57.069]  As you know, today there was a big problem.
[00:59:57.169 --> 00:59:59.130]  In Philadelphia, they went in to watch.
[00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:00.710]  They were called poll watchers.
[01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:02.330]  A very safe, very nice thing.
[01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:03.630]  They were thrown out.
[01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:04.911]  They weren't allowed to watch.
[01:00:05.231 --> 01:00:05.751]  You know why?
[01:00:05.771 --> 01:00:08.071]  Because bad things happen in Philadelphia.
[01:00:08.131 --> 01:00:08.791]  Bad things.
[01:00:09.251 --> 01:00:13.512]  And I am urging, I am urging my people, I hope it's going to be a fair election.
[01:00:13.552 --> 01:00:16.753]  If it's a fair election, I am 100% on board.
[01:00:17.053 --> 01:00:22.314]  But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that.
[01:00:22.634 --> 01:00:23.294]  And I'll tell you what,
[01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:25.935]  I'll tell you what it means.
[01:00:25.995 --> 01:00:28.056]  It means you have a fraudulent election.
[01:00:28.476 --> 01:00:30.217]  You're sending out 80 million ballots.
[01:00:30.257 --> 01:00:31.598]  They're not equipped.
[01:00:32.098 --> 01:00:34.259]  These people aren't equipped to handle it, number one.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.780]  Number two, they cheat.
[01:00:36.401 --> 01:00:36.881]  They cheat.
[01:00:37.141 --> 01:00:43.924]  Hey, they found ballots in a waste paper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots.
[01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:44.625]  They were military.
[01:00:44.905 --> 01:00:46.466]  They all had the name Trump on them.
[01:00:46.966 --> 01:00:50.149]  Vice President Biden, final question for you.
[01:00:50.209 --> 01:00:59.777]  Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted, and will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?
[01:00:59.917 --> 01:01:00.237]  Yes.
[01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:03.861]  God, the whole country is going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:09.345]  And the really good news is that people are starting to wake up to that fact.
[01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.406]  They're starting to get involved.
[01:01:10.426 --> 01:01:12.308]  They're starting to get informed.
[01:01:12.328 --> 01:01:14.490]  They're starting to really
[01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:22.039]  Understand that not being engaged, not being involved is only going to make things worse.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.302]  It's not going to make things better.
[01:01:25.483 --> 01:01:26.705]  It's only going to make things worse.
[01:01:27.946 --> 01:01:29.868]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:01:29.948 --> 01:01:31.350]  We've had so much freedom.
[01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:35.675]  We've been so decadent so long, myself included, that evil crept in and took over.
[01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:38.153]  And it'll take everything you've got.
[01:01:38.173 --> 01:01:39.074]  It doesn't care.
[01:01:39.114 --> 01:01:39.895]  It never gives in.
[01:01:39.915 --> 01:01:46.262]  It never gives up until you stand up and until you say no and until you don't go along with it.
[01:01:46.422 --> 01:01:50.346]  And I know as an audience of activists, you're the best people out there ever.
[01:01:51.487 --> 01:01:52.608]  And again, I just salute you.
[01:01:52.628 --> 01:01:56.693]  I just thank you for everything you're doing because
[01:01:58.027 --> 01:02:06.771]  InfoWars is literally the community of the show, the crew, everything we do, all of you out there, and we are the resistance.
[01:02:06.831 --> 01:02:09.953]  We called the globalists, we studied them, we knew their moves.
[01:02:10.513 --> 01:02:20.958]  Everybody else was busy being a Democrat, being a Republican, being a Libertarian, being this, being that, in kind of their own little fantasy land about how things really worked, while we were looking at the big picture.
[01:02:21.679 --> 01:02:24.060]  So it's not about giving ourselves credit.
[01:02:25.154 --> 01:02:33.219]  It's about being honest about the fact that we know the way out of this, we know who the enemy is, and we know how to resist them.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.802]  And so we need to tell everybody, hey, we're in.
[01:02:37.502 --> 01:02:38.763]  We've really got the answers.
[01:02:39.503 --> 01:02:42.525]  That's why I was so demonized three years ago, two years ago.
[01:02:42.945 --> 01:02:44.026]  That's why we're so banned.
[01:02:44.607 --> 01:02:48.209]  Because they couldn't have the general public figure out what was going on.
[01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:51.091]  And I didn't know how influential we were even three, four years ago.
[01:02:51.111 --> 01:02:54.153]  I mean, I knew we were having a big effect thanks to you amplifying our message, but
[01:02:54.853 --> 01:02:59.316]  They would approach me and go, Oh, just say you were wrong about this and we'll be nice to you.
[01:02:59.496 --> 01:03:01.197]  I was like, Oh, I might've been wrong about this or that.
[01:03:01.797 --> 01:03:06.200]  They get me to say a few things I said were wrong out of hundreds of thousands of things.
[01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:08.722]  And then they go, Oh, look, he's a fraud.
[01:03:08.762 --> 01:03:09.342]  He's a liar.
[01:03:09.882 --> 01:03:13.745]  Because they don't want you to know what's happening.
[01:03:14.425 --> 01:03:14.946]  You can go read.
[01:03:16.391 --> 01:03:17.273]  We're good to go.
[01:03:26.226 --> 01:03:32.508]  And how he gave a speech that he would destroy American democracy, that's what he called it, and would override America.
[01:03:32.788 --> 01:03:36.929]  There's a Bloomberg article out about how China's still going to win and America's going to get it.
[01:03:37.509 --> 01:03:43.951]  And all the Lloyd Blankfeins and all the Bloombergs are totally invested in China, rooting against America.
[01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:46.012]  They're moving on from this host.
[01:03:46.792 --> 01:03:49.374]  For the poor communist Chinese to feed on these people.
[01:03:49.754 --> 01:03:50.594]  I want to free China.
[01:03:50.674 --> 01:03:51.715]  I want to see them free market.
[01:03:52.115 --> 01:03:55.077]  I want to see them be an economic rival in the free market.
[01:03:55.117 --> 01:03:55.678]  That's great.
[01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:57.639]  If China became freer than us, I'd move there.
[01:03:58.219 --> 01:03:58.960]  But that's not the truth.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:00.621]  It's an engine of corruption.
[01:04:01.541 --> 01:04:02.582]  It's an engine of tyranny.
[01:04:03.162 --> 01:04:04.283]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[01:04:04.403 --> 01:04:06.044]  And it's the model of the world.
[01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:11.648]  So when you see China, the globalists admit that's what they see for you.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.502]  A nightmare scenario.
[01:04:14.922 --> 01:04:16.625]  And China's going to get worse.
[01:04:16.765 --> 01:04:17.766]  And we're going to get worse.
[01:04:18.227 --> 01:04:26.238]  Once the globals get you under a social credit score, they don't just stop with you submitting to forced inoculations and going to political correctness training and doing all this.
[01:04:27.366 --> 01:04:30.307]  They want more and more and more and more.
[01:04:30.887 --> 01:04:34.707]  All of this is about getting control of your psyche, getting control of your mind.
[01:04:34.747 --> 01:04:35.988]  And people say, oh, why are you scaring us?
[01:04:36.088 --> 01:04:36.248]  No.
[01:04:36.608 --> 01:04:37.208]  I believe in you.
[01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:52.691]  I believe when you're faced with the real crisis and the real threat, you're going to rise to the occasion and understand just how incredibly serious this is and decide to not lay in the dicks like a slave and roll over, but get involved in the animating contest of liberty, which makes you stronger, not weaker.
[01:04:53.407 --> 01:04:54.288]  Tell folks to tune in.
[01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:58.071]  We'll be right back with the big globalist news and major election fraud information straight ahead.
[01:04:58.091 --> 01:04:59.592]  Infowars.com.
[01:04:59.652 --> 01:05:00.573]  Newswars.com.
[01:05:00.633 --> 01:05:01.614]  Ban.video.
[01:05:02.054 --> 01:05:03.996]  Ban.video with all the forbidden videos.
[01:05:04.016 --> 01:05:05.477]  You're doing a great job promoting it.
[01:05:05.697 --> 01:05:07.298]  We're giving the enemy a real run for their money.
[01:05:07.318 --> 01:05:07.719]  Stay with us.
[01:05:08.519 --> 01:05:09.841]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:15.125]  Well, normally everything that comes out of Joe Biden's mouth is a lie.
[01:05:15.986 --> 01:05:17.287]  It's an inversion of reality.
[01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:20.810]  About 97% of the time.
[01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:22.231]  But when he's pledging
[01:05:24.013 --> 01:05:26.635]  Allegiance to the Globalist and Open Borders or the U.N.
[01:05:27.076 --> 01:05:28.197]  or the Communist Chinese.
[01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:40.147]  When he says the Communist Chinese should dictate every aspect of American life, from school to sports to culture, that's a pledge of enslavement.
[01:05:40.588 --> 01:05:41.509]  That's getting on his knees.
[01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:48.395]  And when his son is on tape, you know, caught saying I work for the Communist Chinese government, their top spy chief,
[01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:54.454]  All that is a sign that we really are a bitch nation, according to the globalists, according to the communists, according to the big corporations.
[01:05:54.474 --> 01:05:55.815]  There's nothing we won't put up with.
[01:05:55.835 --> 01:05:56.616]  There's nothing we won't take.
[01:05:58.337 --> 01:06:07.585]  But where Joe Biden told the truth was, of course, just a month or so ago, he said, if I'm elected, I will do whatever the scientist says.
[01:06:08.046 --> 01:06:10.328]  That means the UN globalist scientist
[01:06:11.408 --> 01:06:14.910]  That the real scientists say don't wear masks because bacterial infections doesn't protect you.
[01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:18.533]  The real scientists say you're adding all the deaths for other people in the column of COVID.
[01:06:18.553 --> 01:06:23.396]  The real scientists say most of the COVID positives are false positives.
[01:06:23.576 --> 01:06:25.257]  Almost no one gets sick or asymptomatic.
[01:06:25.277 --> 01:06:27.218]  I mean, even...
[01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:38.476]  Klaus Schwab, who runs this whole thing with Bill Gates, said that it's not really COVID, we're just using it as an excuse for the Great Reset to make you poor to save the Earth.
[01:06:38.856 --> 01:06:43.818]  Because you're consuming too much, but they've got their private jets, and they're on their mountaintops at Davos.
[01:06:44.859 --> 01:06:47.460]  So it really is the sickest thing in the world.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.882]  It's like having Jeff Bezos lobby for higher taxes on Americans.
[01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:52.682]  These tax exempted worth $160 billion.
[01:06:55.174 --> 01:06:56.195]  Doesn't pay any taxes.
[01:06:56.295 --> 01:07:02.298]  I mean, it's just insane how politically and economically ignorant the leftists are.
[01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:03.899]  I'm with Hollywood.
[01:07:03.939 --> 01:07:04.880]  I'm with the chi-coms.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:05.740]  I'm with the big banks.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.621]  I'm with the globalists.
[01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:07.681]  I'm with the Defense Department.
[01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:08.782]  I'm against Trump.
[01:07:09.242 --> 01:07:09.763]  I'm woke.
[01:07:10.023 --> 01:07:11.704]  I'm the resistance.
[01:07:12.985 --> 01:07:13.325]  Oh really?
[01:07:13.385 --> 01:07:16.106]  That's why you're not getting banned on the internet?
[01:07:16.126 --> 01:07:17.427]  You're not getting banned on Airbnb?
[01:07:17.447 --> 01:07:18.928]  You're not getting banned from banks?
[01:07:19.428 --> 01:07:20.749]  You're not getting persecuted like we are?
[01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:23.691]  Because you work for the most evil elements in the system.
[01:07:24.616 --> 01:07:47.901]  You're disgusting little leftists that inherited what freedoms left, fumes in the tank, as you work with the establishment because it gives you some cachet and some minute in the sun when you are seen as the ultimate chump, the ultimate chump, schmuck, idiot, sucker, mark, moron, fool, useful idiot.
[01:07:48.382 --> 01:07:49.922]  You are bamboozled, but they don't care.
[01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:54.897]  Because they're delusional and all they care about is what they think in their mind.
[01:07:55.377 --> 01:07:56.638]  Doesn't matter they're an idiot.
[01:07:57.098 --> 01:07:58.358]  Doesn't matter they've been conned.
[01:07:58.658 --> 01:07:59.979]  Doesn't matter they're disrespected.
[01:08:00.259 --> 01:08:01.699]  Doesn't matter they're still not their birthright.
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:03.300]  Doesn't matter they have no chivalry.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.500]  Doesn't matter they have no honor.
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:06.141]  They delusionally
[01:08:07.927 --> 01:08:09.567]  They're not even gay, most of these dudes.
[01:08:09.607 --> 01:08:10.287]  Most of them are white.
[01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:15.509]  But you see them, they kind of sashay and kind of act like they're a woman, like, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:08:15.669 --> 01:08:17.809]  And they laugh at you, they walk by and laugh at you.
[01:08:18.489 --> 01:08:20.630]  They laugh at me when I'm eating dinner or out on the street.
[01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:29.731]  They go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:08:32.674 --> 01:08:39.939]  And that the chemicals in the water and the cultural upbringing and their fathers not being at home and them not being disciplined has created such slugs.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.321]  And I'm not a guy that gets into race stuff.
[01:08:44.742 --> 01:09:01.273]  But it is white people leading this whole leftist movement and then trying to seduce people of color into being idiots and serving this system that wants to destroy their own self-interest and their own potential to inherit the American birthright and the renaissance of Christianity.
[01:09:02.824 --> 01:09:03.885]  Now let's get into it right now.
[01:09:04.345 --> 01:09:05.266]  Biden told the truth.
[01:09:05.286 --> 01:09:07.568]  He said, I will follow the science.
[01:09:07.608 --> 01:09:12.111]  That means the science, science, science, science, science.
[01:09:12.352 --> 01:09:14.233]  2.5 billion will be dead by March.
[01:09:14.353 --> 01:09:15.194]  Science, science.
[01:09:15.955 --> 01:09:22.180]  5 million will be dead, you know, by... It's 260-something thousand, almost all of them from other death columns.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.361]  Suddenly there's no flu.
[01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:24.461]  Suddenly there's no pneumonia.
[01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.790]  Funny.
[01:09:26.571 --> 01:09:33.314]  Usually a year from flu and pneumonia and people dying of other viral infections is over a million people.
[01:09:34.674 --> 01:09:37.595]  And nine, ten months into it, all they've got is 260,000.
[01:09:38.276 --> 01:09:40.837]  This is actually a very low year.
[01:09:42.257 --> 01:09:44.759]  Except for some of the bacterial pneumonias we're seeing from the mask.
[01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:46.559]  So they're totally pissed.
[01:09:46.579 --> 01:09:47.700]  They don't want to know what to do.
[01:09:49.161 --> 01:09:53.224]  As soon as medical doctors figured out the scam and wouldn't put COVID on the death certificate, they're screwed.
[01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:55.586]  It's all infection, infection, infection, infection.
[01:09:55.806 --> 01:09:56.707]  Look at the infection!
[01:09:57.628 --> 01:09:58.248]  There's graphs.
[01:09:58.689 --> 01:10:01.851]  As you increase the testing, it follows the infection curve.
[01:10:03.452 --> 01:10:06.154]  And who developed the main methodologies of the testing that's been adopted?
[01:10:06.294 --> 01:10:08.937]  Oh, the Wuhan lab at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:10:09.775 --> 01:10:13.838]  And who runs the censorship for all the major internet companies, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all of it?
[01:10:14.398 --> 01:10:19.301]  Oh, a lady that works at Wuhan that owns part of the patent on one of the main tests for Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:10:19.361 --> 01:10:20.082]  Can't make this up.
[01:10:20.642 --> 01:10:30.549]  So here's Joe Biden telling you about the new dark age, that if he gets selected, installed, forced in, Trump finally turned against the COVID exaggeration, the COVID power grab.
[01:10:30.969 --> 01:10:31.530]  God bless him.
[01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:32.230]  Was it too late?
[01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.690]  We'll see.
[01:10:33.251 --> 01:10:36.653]  But Biden's pledging, he's saying now he's going to shut it down.
[01:10:36.693 --> 01:10:37.954]  Well, here's what he had said a few months ago.
[01:10:39.377 --> 01:10:46.704]  We're sworn in come January and we have coronavirus and the flu combining, which many scientists have said is a real possibility.
[01:10:47.564 --> 01:10:49.867]  Would you be prepared to shut this country down again?
[01:10:49.887 --> 01:10:58.635]  I would be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus.
[01:10:59.315 --> 01:11:02.899]  That is the fundamental flaw of this administration's thinking to begin with.
[01:11:03.639 --> 01:11:11.785]  In order to keep the country running and moving and the economy growing and people employed, you have to fix the virus.
[01:11:11.805 --> 01:11:13.186]  You have to deal with the virus.
[01:11:13.486 --> 01:11:15.347]  So if the scientists say, shut it down?
[01:11:15.568 --> 01:11:16.448]  I would shut it down.
[01:11:16.728 --> 01:11:18.530]  I would listen to the scientists.
[01:11:20.951 --> 01:11:22.092]  The globalist scientists.
[01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:23.033]  So let's talk about that.
[01:11:24.929 --> 01:11:42.138]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, I can play the clips if you like, anybody can type this in, said there's no way to ever control it, it's out there forever, it's going to keep mutating, good and bad, and the vaccines won't even protect you, but you're still going to take them, and you'll just have to have immunity for a while and then not have it.
[01:11:42.158 --> 01:11:45.160]  I mean, all of this, if you know the science, is that they're a lying fraud.
[01:11:46.715 --> 01:11:47.936]  So here's this CHICOM agent.
[01:11:48.557 --> 01:11:51.039]  China's open for business again, after a few months.
[01:11:51.399 --> 01:11:52.080]  We're closed.
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.141]  We're never going to reopen.
[01:11:53.361 --> 01:11:54.722]  The EU's super unpopular.
[01:11:55.142 --> 01:11:58.385]  It's never going to reopen, they're saying, because it's an authoritarian takeover.
[01:11:58.665 --> 01:12:00.647]  Did you think they'd have just foreign troops come in?
[01:12:00.947 --> 01:12:07.733]  No, they're using the virus and the media to scare you into your holes, to scare you into your houses, while you go into debt.
[01:12:08.154 --> 01:12:10.315]  Oh, and Joe Biden's come out with his new advisor.
[01:12:11.314 --> 01:12:13.655]  And said, oh, we need to get another government payment.
[01:12:14.335 --> 01:12:16.236]  Just four to six weeks, don't leave your house.
[01:12:16.796 --> 01:12:18.156]  We need to have a total lockdown.
[01:12:19.237 --> 01:12:22.398]  Minnesota, you know, said 70% of people were essential.
[01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:24.479]  You're all unessential.
[01:12:24.939 --> 01:12:28.340]  You've got to stay in your houses, but we've got to come to your house and force test you, though.
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:32.201]  And then if you test positive, we're taking you and your family away.
[01:12:32.821 --> 01:12:36.723]  So industrializing vans and police, they don't want police for
[01:12:37.748 --> 01:12:51.023]  Robberies or murders or child abductions, but they do want them to come, as it's already started in El Paso, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia, and come in and saying, you know, you didn't contact Tracer.
[01:12:51.323 --> 01:12:53.345]  Somebody at a restaurant you work at came up with COVID.
[01:12:53.946 --> 01:12:55.327]  You can't leave your house now.
[01:12:55.648 --> 01:12:57.490]  And by the way, we're going to take you to this FEMA center.
[01:12:58.666 --> 01:13:02.549]  And I have crew members at our office who have family that work for the state.
[01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:05.872]  One person in the state office had COVID, they claimed.
[01:13:06.252 --> 01:13:12.737]  So everyone was sent home and they were told, you're fired if you're caught outside your house.
[01:13:13.077 --> 01:13:17.140]  And next is the app tracking you and, oh, you don't take your phone out.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.601]  Oh, we noticed your phone didn't move.
[01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:20.663]  This is a prison system.
[01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:22.344]  It's called a lockdown.
[01:13:24.086 --> 01:13:24.846]  We got to go to break.
[01:13:24.866 --> 01:13:28.009]  When we come back, I'm going to play this clip.
[01:13:29.355 --> 01:13:35.098]  Uh, of, uh, Biden's head, quote, scientist saying he wants a strong lockdown.
[01:13:36.019 --> 01:13:38.140]  This is called lockdown in prisons.
[01:13:39.621 --> 01:13:44.003]  In prisons, if an inmate gets in a fight or somebody stabs somebody, they go, all right, that's it.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:53.926]  Everybody's on lockdown for a week, meaning you don't get to go out to the cafeteria, you don't get to go out the yard, you don't get to lift weights, you don't get to go work in the prison industry.
[01:13:54.406 --> 01:13:56.247]  You've got to stay in your cell.
[01:13:56.348 --> 01:13:56.828]  Lockdown.
[01:13:57.188 --> 01:13:58.909]  Lockdown is punishment for criminals.
[01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:02.112]  And the average American loves Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:08.856]  They love being abused, and they love wearing diaper masks, and they love putting them on their kids, and they love being slaves.
[01:14:09.437 --> 01:14:12.139]  So the globalists are going to hurt you real bad.
[01:14:12.819 --> 01:14:17.960]  Permanent lockdown, total collapse, total depression, third world dies, you're next.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.081]  And Klaus Schwab says it's about killing you, about depopulating you.
[01:14:22.441 --> 01:14:25.722]  So, I guess go ahead and start committing suicide, everybody.
[01:14:26.182 --> 01:14:27.762]  Or you can stand up and say no to these monsters.
[01:14:28.162 --> 01:14:28.723]  We'll be right back.
[01:14:28.763 --> 01:14:30.003]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:14:30.323 --> 01:14:31.163]  InfoWars.com.
[01:14:31.183 --> 01:14:31.983]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:14:33.104 --> 01:14:38.925]  So, Biden is creating a new task force on the martial law, globalist government.
[01:14:39.738 --> 01:14:51.164]  Flowered and Piven Depression Weapon, which Klaus Schwab admits is directed by the UN, the World Economic Forum, to bring down Europe and the United States so these big banks can consolidate control and buy up the economy.
[01:14:52.045 --> 01:15:02.091]  Once you don't go to hotels, once you don't go to rent car places, once they bankrupt the farms, once they bankrupt the whole infrastructure, the travel industry, it's just a depression so they can buy everything up.
[01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:08.878]  And then they give you tracker chips and forced inoculations and living death as the little gravy.
[01:15:09.619 --> 01:15:14.585]  And you're under a social credit score, the likes of which puts Silicon Valley in control of your every movement.
[01:15:15.627 --> 01:15:15.787]  But...
[01:15:17.549 --> 01:15:25.095]  Osterholm, or however you pronounce his name, Michael Osterholm, we know who Ezekiel Emanuel is.
[01:15:25.435 --> 01:15:26.336]  We need death panels.
[01:15:26.396 --> 01:15:27.957]  Everyone should be killed at 75.
[01:15:28.417 --> 01:15:30.419]  We put in Obamacare to bankrupt America.
[01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:31.380]  We believe in communism.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.361]  We know who that monster is.
[01:15:33.381 --> 01:15:36.644]  I mean, you wouldn't let that guy babysit your kids.
[01:15:37.584 --> 01:15:42.748]  But this guy's just some socialist doctor out of Minnesota, and now he goes, I'm the science.
[01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:44.870]  We're going to shut things down.
[01:15:46.132 --> 01:15:47.053]  Four to six weeks.
[01:15:47.774 --> 01:15:50.856]  The power to have the federal government shut down the country is unconstitutional.
[01:15:51.217 --> 01:15:51.998]  It's martial law.
[01:15:52.418 --> 01:15:53.959]  Especially when it's under the UN.
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:55.781]  Especially when it's proven to be a fraud.
[01:15:55.801 --> 01:16:01.767]  And especially when it causes a chain reaction to destroy the economy here and kill people in the third world with starvation.
[01:16:01.787 --> 01:16:04.990]  Because when we shut down the first world, the third world implodes.
[01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:07.577]  This is so aggressive.
[01:16:07.617 --> 01:16:08.418]  This is so evil.
[01:16:08.719 --> 01:16:09.760]  This is so fraudulent.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.206]  This is what you get with the stolen election they're trying to execute with Joe Biden.
[01:16:14.226 --> 01:16:15.147]  But the cavalry's here.
[01:16:15.207 --> 01:16:20.454]  The good news is the fraud is all coming out in a big, big, beautiful way.
[01:16:21.295 --> 01:16:24.800]  And that's why InfoWars.com is so important and Bandot Video.
[01:16:26.397 --> 01:16:26.957]  It's beautiful.
[01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:28.398]  Everybody else is shut down.
[01:16:28.438 --> 01:16:29.398]  Everybody else is censored.
[01:16:29.438 --> 01:16:30.018]  That's terrible.
[01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:36.501]  But it's beautiful in this nightmare to have that shining light of InfoWars, thanks to you, still on air.
[01:16:36.781 --> 01:16:38.942]  When YouTube was down yesterday, InfoWars is up.
[01:16:40.382 --> 01:16:45.044]  But they're testing the internet kill switch right now ahead of killing Trump or ahead of something bigger.
[01:16:45.785 --> 01:16:46.905]  And there could be something even bigger.
[01:16:46.945 --> 01:16:47.905]  Nuclear war, you name it.
[01:16:48.446 --> 01:16:53.928]  Anything is in the cards right now with these crazies because the globalists that sold America off to China
[01:16:55.179 --> 01:16:56.660]  They've made agreements that were illegal.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.162]  And in comes Trump saying we're not following those agreements.
[01:17:00.963 --> 01:17:09.468]  That's why you have all these corporations lined up that sold out America as middlemen that are getting trillions of dollars every year in the aggregate.
[01:17:10.369 --> 01:17:15.852]  They're fighting like the devil to hand us back over to world government because it's over for them if this comes out.
[01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:16.853]  They're going to prison.
[01:17:18.914 --> 01:17:20.996]  So they're cornered rats and if Trump did anything
[01:17:21.997 --> 01:17:24.978]  He underestimated these people because they're corner rats.
[01:17:25.018 --> 01:17:26.439]  He predicted the frogs, so did we.
[01:17:26.479 --> 01:17:28.920]  But now they're so damn dangerous.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.342]  And if they're able to get Biden in, they're coming down on us with both feet.
[01:17:32.362 --> 01:17:33.523]  They're coming down on you with both feet.
[01:17:34.223 --> 01:17:35.323]  Because they know you're awake.
[01:17:35.383 --> 01:17:38.705]  They know you're the enemy of their whole world government pedophile plan.
[01:17:39.005 --> 01:17:41.867]  These are very sick, empty, selfish people.
[01:17:42.947 --> 01:17:45.068]  They're not into prosperity for you.
[01:17:45.348 --> 01:17:46.729]  They're not into hospitality.
[01:17:46.769 --> 01:17:47.789]  They're into the opposite.
[01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:50.831]  They're into dominating and controlling.
[01:17:51.564 --> 01:17:55.566]  So here's your new doctor, and I've got big Bill Gates news after we play it.
[01:17:55.606 --> 01:18:01.509]  Here's the head of the task force for Biden telling you a big, strong lockdown's coming.
[01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:03.070]  Thank you.
[01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:05.211]  And that is lockdowns.
[01:18:05.811 --> 01:18:08.252]  If I interviewed 50 people today in the U.S.
[01:18:08.312 --> 01:18:11.934]  for what they define a lockdown as, I could get 75 different answers.
[01:18:12.895 --> 01:18:19.178]  And I think that one of the challenges has been that there really is an understanding of what a lockdown is all about.
[01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:24.200]  We talk about the pain and suffering of the virus, but the pain and suffering to the economy and what it does.
[01:18:24.681 --> 01:18:32.305]  You know, I'd refer everyone back to an op-ed piece in early August that Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank and I did in the New York Times.
[01:18:32.825 --> 01:18:35.286]  Number one, we predicted where we'd be right now.
[01:18:35.607 --> 01:18:37.908]  We said this would happen if we did nothing different.
[01:18:38.468 --> 01:18:45.391]  Number two is that when you look at the personal savings rate in this country, it's now gone from about 8% to over 22%.
[01:18:45.951 --> 01:18:48.892]  We have a big pool of money out there that we could borrow.
[01:18:49.352 --> 01:19:05.798]  The historic low interest rates by the federal government, we could pay for a package right now to cover all of the wages, lost wages for individual workers, for losses to small companies, to medium-sized companies, for city, states, county governments, we could do all of that.
[01:19:06.258 --> 01:19:09.479]  If we did that, then we could lock down for four to six weeks.
[01:19:09.519 --> 01:19:16.800]  And if we did that, we could drive the numbers down, like they've done in Asia, like they did in New Zealand and Australia.
[01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:23.321]  So he wants you to live like they do in Australia, where they've had less than a hundred real deaths from COVID.
[01:19:24.162 --> 01:19:25.102]  Thousands for other things.
[01:19:25.122 --> 01:19:25.842]  They call it COVID.
[01:19:25.882 --> 01:19:27.002]  I mean, this is a total cult.
[01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:29.063]  Oh, the Federal Reserve wants that money.
[01:19:29.583 --> 01:19:30.863]  They want to get you deeper in debt.
[01:19:32.230 --> 01:19:33.151]  We're totally in debt.
[01:19:33.771 --> 01:19:34.371]  It's all a fraud.
[01:19:34.631 --> 01:19:35.892]  He doesn't tell you to take vitamin D3.
[01:19:35.952 --> 01:19:38.274]  He doesn't tell you to take vitamin C, take zinc.
[01:19:38.334 --> 01:19:38.794]  No, no, no.
[01:19:39.054 --> 01:19:40.395]  Where you take that, you're 100% covered.
[01:19:41.015 --> 01:19:48.359]  He just sits here and tells you, oh, we told you we'd be here 8 months ago because you had it all planned.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.940]  I said that 8 months ago.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:50.801]  9 months ago.
[01:19:51.997 --> 01:19:53.238]  You knew the winter was going to come.
[01:19:53.258 --> 01:19:54.279]  You knew there'd be flu deaths.
[01:19:54.699 --> 01:19:56.700]  You knew there'd be pneumonia deaths, and you'd count those.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:03.925]  And you knew as you went from thousands of tests, to millions of tests, to hundreds of millions of tests, and Biden going, every American gets a test.
[01:20:04.486 --> 01:20:07.588]  So you're now on a list that you've got COVID, and you're a bad person.
[01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:10.490]  You could be disappeared, because they now go, oh, it comes back.
[01:20:11.954 --> 01:20:14.775]  The antibodies don't work for COVID because it's all a fraud.
[01:20:15.335 --> 01:20:16.176]  It's a cold virus.
[01:20:16.196 --> 01:20:19.237]  You can't have an antibody for it because it's too many of them.
[01:20:19.837 --> 01:20:22.278]  They pick something that's a problem that can't be fixed.
[01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:30.981]  And now they're like, oh my God, the level of infection goes up, but the death doesn't go up because it's the normal death rate in the country.
[01:20:31.581 --> 01:20:33.582]  So this is the ultimate chicken little fraud.
[01:20:34.901 --> 01:20:41.425]  You've got this sick, filthy, globalist tyrant, more dangerous than Hitler, up there telling you, we need what Australia had.
[01:20:41.986 --> 01:20:43.907]  Not leaving your house, not leaving your house.
[01:20:43.927 --> 01:20:46.929]  They have to have dogs poop on the floor and they throw the poop out.
[01:20:47.769 --> 01:20:52.032]  In Australia, for six months, women wearing masks with their kids being slammed to the ground.
[01:20:52.592 --> 01:20:54.393]  This is a commie takeover, folks.
[01:20:56.095 --> 01:20:57.756]  You gotta resist it, you gotta say no.
[01:20:58.871 --> 01:21:01.493]  Go read the Archbishop's article at Infowars.com.
[01:21:01.533 --> 01:21:05.575]  Archbishop writes open letter to Trump warning of COVID health dictatorship.
[01:21:06.276 --> 01:21:09.198]  They admitted in the Rockefeller plan it's a health dictatorship.
[01:21:10.338 --> 01:21:16.502]  Klaus Schwab says it's not about COVID, it's about saving the earth and lowering our productivity and making us debtors.
[01:21:16.962 --> 01:21:20.104]  Where everyone is so bankrupt they're owned by a World Bank.
[01:21:22.206 --> 01:21:23.206]  He says it!
[01:21:24.227 --> 01:21:25.848]  That's what's so insane about this.
[01:21:26.208 --> 01:21:27.329]  And I literally talked to like
[01:21:28.291 --> 01:21:30.072]  High-level lawyers, high-level feds.
[01:21:30.812 --> 01:21:32.453]  And I'm like talking to people at the White House about this.
[01:21:32.473 --> 01:21:40.198]  I mean, I knew about this Dominion thing three days ago, but I was asked not to say anything because they didn't want to get in the way of the whistleblowers.
[01:21:40.238 --> 01:21:41.339]  They got even bigger stuff coming.
[01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:42.919]  Praise God, it's amazing.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.361]  They've got absolute video.
[01:21:45.641 --> 01:21:46.922]  It's devastating.
[01:21:48.643 --> 01:21:50.204]  And talk about, oh, I'm name-dropping.
[01:21:50.244 --> 01:21:51.644]  I mean, I'm just on the inside track.
[01:21:51.905 --> 01:21:55.887]  And I'm literally talking to high-level people, Defense Intelligence Agency, White House.
[01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:58.231]  And I'm like, you know about the Great Reset?
[01:21:58.271 --> 01:21:59.412]  Yeah, we're hearing a lot about that.
[01:21:59.472 --> 01:21:59.892]  What is it?
[01:22:00.313 --> 01:22:03.315]  They don't even know what they're up against.
[01:22:03.915 --> 01:22:09.559]  Because the mainstream media is about, oh, it's Russia, and oh, it's China, and it's Mexico, and it's India.
[01:22:10.119 --> 01:22:13.421]  But there's a global corporate governance that's bigger than all that.
[01:22:14.122 --> 01:22:16.183]  And it's running things, and it's the enemy.
[01:22:16.764 --> 01:22:23.488]  We're so used to fighting nation states, but we don't get China is a controlled opposition system within the New World Order.
[01:22:24.909 --> 01:22:25.850]  It's just insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:26.847 --> 01:22:27.907]  I need funding to stay on air.
[01:22:27.967 --> 01:22:29.168]  We've done so much great work.
[01:22:29.548 --> 01:22:30.568]  We're committed in the fight.
[01:22:30.708 --> 01:22:31.508]  Keep us in the fight.
[01:22:32.008 --> 01:22:33.688]  I salute you for keeping us in the fight.
[01:22:34.329 --> 01:22:40.510]  We have the Stop Lockdown 2, Stop the Steal emergency transmission.
[01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:45.651]  We're going to be marching right outside the White House at high noon on Saturday.
[01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:47.451]  Antifa says they're coming out there.
[01:22:47.471 --> 01:22:47.831]  Good luck.
[01:22:47.851 --> 01:22:49.231]  There'll be a lot more patriots than them.
[01:22:49.611 --> 01:22:52.132]  The media will try to ignore it, but you can stream it and get it out yourself.
[01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:59.232]  Please join us at that and please financially support us because it takes a lot of money to fight a war effectively.
[01:22:59.612 --> 01:23:02.553]  And I just want to thank you all for keeping us in the fight, keeping yourself in the fight.
[01:23:03.294 --> 01:23:04.734]  We have this big mega sale going.
[01:23:04.814 --> 01:23:05.735]  I need to clear everything out.
[01:23:05.795 --> 01:23:07.556]  I told you I had a feeling there was still the election.
[01:23:08.076 --> 01:23:10.637]  We have to get funds in now because lockdown 2 is coming.
[01:23:11.177 --> 01:23:12.938]  Get restorable food at fullrestore.com.
[01:23:12.958 --> 01:23:18.280]  Pairwithalex.com, by the way, has another huge $100 off a one-month supply.

[01:23:29.361 --> 01:23:30.922]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:23:31.442 --> 01:23:33.443]  All the same food, same price, same people.
[01:23:34.463 --> 01:23:35.044]  Take your orders.
[01:23:35.464 --> 01:23:37.465]  They're in our backyard at DimpleMoreStore.com.

[01:23:43.821 --> 01:23:45.142]  All these sales have to end soon.
[01:23:45.162 --> 01:23:51.963]  There's a bunch of stuff like Vitamineral Fusion, and X2, and bodies, and Ultimate Grill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil.
[01:23:53.143 --> 01:23:55.084]  They're all very, very close to selling out.
[01:23:56.264 --> 01:24:01.465]  And I just need to get money into the bank to keep running into next year because I know they're going to lock everything down.
[01:24:01.505 --> 01:24:02.885]  Our supply chain is already breaking down.
[01:24:03.826 --> 01:24:05.486]  Everything we have in stock, we have ready to ship.
[01:24:06.069 --> 01:24:08.250]  But so many suppliers can't even supply to us anymore.
[01:24:08.671 --> 01:24:10.412]  So many things have been discontinued because we can't get it.
[01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.373]  We're watching this, I think, right now.
[01:24:12.393 --> 01:24:16.596]  We're watching economic warfare against America and the world right now.
[01:24:16.636 --> 01:24:19.258]  So get your orders in to supply yourself into next year.
[01:24:19.278 --> 01:24:20.418]  I need you to do that.
[01:24:20.498 --> 01:24:21.839]  Plus, these are great products you already need.
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.220]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.984]  Number one, get DNA Force Plus and get also Alpha Powers back in stock if I tell you about that.
[01:24:29.444 --> 01:24:30.605]  All right, next hour is coming up.
[01:24:30.705 --> 01:24:32.026]  Owen Schroeder is in Raleigh.
[01:24:33.353 --> 01:24:34.277]  We're going to have him on.
[01:24:34.417 --> 01:24:35.441]  We've got Harrison Smith.
[01:24:35.582 --> 01:24:37.067]  I'll be here and so much more.
[01:24:37.087 --> 01:24:38.533]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:24:40.831 --> 01:24:46.653]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com and the Stop the Steal Caravan is rolling on.
[01:24:47.094 --> 01:24:54.196]  We have departed from Columbia, South Carolina and we are on our way to Raleigh, North Carolina for another rally today.
[01:24:54.577 --> 01:24:55.937]  A Stop the Steal Rally.
[01:24:56.077 --> 01:24:57.818]  And then on to Richmond, Virginia.
[01:24:57.838 --> 01:25:02.080]  We're going to be at both the state capitol buildings ahead of heading to our nation's capitol.
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:04.461]  And our movement keeps growing.
[01:25:04.981 --> 01:25:06.261]  We keep getting more cars.
[01:25:06.862 --> 01:25:09.723]  We keep getting more followers on Parler.
[01:25:10.163 --> 01:25:18.211]  And we keep getting more attention and people wondering what we're doing on the road and in the cities that we go to.
[01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:20.853]  So it's been a really incredible thing to be a part of this.
[01:25:21.863 --> 01:25:26.607]  And it's going to be a really incredible thing to see the millions of people that are all caravanning to D.C.
[01:25:27.027 --> 01:25:29.970]  right now for this Stop the Steal weekend.
[01:25:30.650 --> 01:25:36.395]  And it's going to be a repudiation of the fake news and the fake Washington, D.C.
[01:25:36.435 --> 01:25:40.619]  establishment who wants us to believe that Joe Biden actually won this election when we know better.
[01:25:40.739 --> 01:25:47.224]  So, we've left Columbia, South Carolina, and we head now to Raleigh, North Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia.
[01:25:47.544 --> 01:25:48.085]  We'll see you there.
[01:25:55.202 --> 01:26:09.949]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:26:09.989 --> 01:26:13.771]  Infowars has been banned.
[01:26:13.831 --> 01:26:14.411]  Arrested.
[01:26:14.431 --> 01:26:20.454]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:26:20.514 --> 01:26:22.335]  Because we are effective.
[01:26:23.843 --> 01:26:25.284]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:26:25.645 --> 01:26:27.306]  Go to band.video.
[01:26:27.947 --> 01:26:30.089]  Download the videos and share.
[01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:36.354]  Support the Information War at infowarestore.com.
[01:26:39.377 --> 01:26:41.659]  And never give up the fight.
[01:26:56.597 --> 01:27:02.520]  Right in front of our very eyes, we are seeing the globalist deep state at work.
[01:27:03.121 --> 01:27:05.562]  Black Lives Matter and Antifa.
[01:27:05.842 --> 01:27:10.465]  What a terrible, terrible blight upon all people.
[01:27:11.045 --> 01:27:20.591]  Antifa, which they claim means anti-fascist, is absurd, ludicrous, and totally opposite of what they claim to be.
[01:27:20.911 --> 01:27:22.732]  They are not anti-fascist.
[01:27:23.132 --> 01:27:24.653]  They are the fascists.
[01:27:25.456 --> 01:27:26.637]  Black Lives Matter.
[01:27:26.937 --> 01:27:27.618]  It's a ruse.
[01:27:27.938 --> 01:27:28.919]  R-U-S-E.
[01:27:29.419 --> 01:27:35.363]  If Black Lives Matter, then why don't we do something about what is happening?
[01:27:35.884 --> 01:27:37.165]  Blacks on Blacks.
[01:27:37.365 --> 01:27:38.165]  Killing Blacks.
[01:27:38.526 --> 01:27:43.109]  In places like Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.
[01:27:43.389 --> 01:27:46.011]  It's an endless list that won't be missed.
[01:27:46.051 --> 01:27:52.536]  So, the bottom line here is that it's about divide, confusion, chaos, and conquer.
[01:27:53.268 --> 01:28:06.056]  What we're watching here is insanity, and particularly the deep state Democrats and their seditious, despicable, lying media are fanning the flames.
[01:28:06.797 --> 01:28:10.539]  I urge all of my brothers and sisters, don't go for the ghost.
[01:28:11.505 --> 01:28:14.847]  Okay, don't be duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled, okay?
[01:28:15.227 --> 01:28:19.370]  Understand that we are in this struggle as patriots, as U.S.
[01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:21.071]  citizens, together.
[01:28:21.371 --> 01:28:24.753]  What we have on our side is we have each other.
[01:28:25.554 --> 01:28:26.454]  Each other.
[01:28:26.754 --> 01:28:28.856]  And that's extremely powerful.
[01:28:29.076 --> 01:28:37.221]  And that's something that the media, the deep state Democrats, and the rhino Republicans, for that matter, they don't want you to know that.
[01:28:37.641 --> 01:28:40.682]  They want you to think that you're alone, you're by yourself.
[01:28:41.102 --> 01:28:41.803]  You're not alone.
[01:28:42.143 --> 01:28:43.243]  You're not by yourself.
[01:28:43.763 --> 01:28:50.286]  And there are a lot of people, millions, millions, who are thinking just like you.
[01:28:51.567 --> 01:28:53.468]  This is our republic.
[01:28:53.868 --> 01:29:03.894]  This is all about fun and games and hurting people and destroying, not building, not serving the people, body and soul, but the exact opposite.
[01:29:04.274 --> 01:29:07.435]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[01:29:07.736 --> 01:29:08.536]  Don't let them win.
[01:29:08.916 --> 01:29:13.719]  Go to our emergency election newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:29:13.979 --> 01:29:17.521]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[01:29:17.861 --> 01:29:20.142]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:29:20.362 --> 01:29:22.784]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[01:29:39.554 --> 01:29:41.436]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:29:41.716 --> 01:29:43.819]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:29:44.079 --> 01:29:45.140]  This is all confirmed.
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.101]  This is not a drill.
[01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:50.185]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:29:50.525 --> 01:29:51.947]  They've officially become state-run.
[01:29:52.067 --> 01:29:52.548]  Apple 100%.
[01:29:52.948 --> 01:29:58.574]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[01:29:59.014 --> 01:30:03.778]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:04.939]  This is happening.
[01:30:04.979 --> 01:30:12.906]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:30:13.006 --> 01:30:18.911]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:30:19.371 --> 01:30:27.338]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[01:30:28.198 --> 01:30:31.742]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:30:31.802 --> 01:30:35.225]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:30:35.545 --> 01:30:42.552]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[01:30:42.792 --> 01:30:45.454]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:50.739]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[01:30:51.039 --> 01:30:52.681]  It is the virtual reality AI.
[01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:59.467]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:22.031]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:31:22.071 --> 01:31:26.956]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:31:27.337 --> 01:31:32.223]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[01:31:32.523 --> 01:31:40.245]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:31:40.766 --> 01:31:47.468]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:31:47.928 --> 01:31:53.289]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[01:31:53.529 --> 01:31:58.231]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:31:58.251 --> 01:32:00.332]  I have given you the transmission!
[01:32:00.452 --> 01:32:01.392]  Now break free!
[01:32:05.124 --> 01:32:13.810]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:17.092]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:32:17.192 --> 01:32:21.155]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:32:21.295 --> 01:32:23.476]  Ellen Troyer is in Raleigh, North Carolina.
[01:32:28.527 --> 01:32:32.552]  Maybe towards the end of the broadcast, as soon as that speech is going, we'll pop into some of that as soon as that starts.
[01:32:32.952 --> 01:32:36.496]  He was scheduled to be hosting the film of all that right now with the big caravan.
[01:32:36.516 --> 01:32:39.340]  Another thing is the Proud Boys are great people, great patriots.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.162]  The media is calling it a Proud Boy.
[01:32:41.582 --> 01:32:45.967]  They demonize the word Proud Boy, being proud of being a man's bad, being proud of America's bad.
[01:32:45.987 --> 01:32:47.229]  It's white supremacist.
[01:32:47.622 --> 01:32:48.482]  You know, that's not true.
[01:32:48.943 --> 01:32:51.243]  So now the InfoWars Caravan isn't InfoWars.
[01:32:51.744 --> 01:32:53.805]  You know, it's an InfoWars Caravan with InfoWars all over it.
[01:32:53.905 --> 01:32:54.845]  It's Proud Boy.
[01:32:55.325 --> 01:32:58.827]  Nazis are coming to attack black people in D.C.
[01:32:59.427 --> 01:33:00.647]  on Saturday at noon.
[01:33:01.708 --> 01:33:09.091]  They're going to be white folks and black folks and brown folks and old folks and young folks and females and men and everybody else, humans with red blood.
[01:33:09.111 --> 01:33:14.693]  We want our destiny of freedom all out there at noon at the park right by the White House.
[01:33:14.753 --> 01:33:16.514]  And I'll be there as well.
[01:33:17.327 --> 01:33:19.269]  So be sure and join us at that.
[01:33:19.309 --> 01:33:21.391]  I've got a lot of other big announcements about to happen today.
[01:33:21.891 --> 01:33:22.972]  Big stuff coming this evening.
[01:33:22.992 --> 01:33:23.733]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:33:23.753 --> 01:33:25.194]  Big stuff tomorrow.
[01:33:25.575 --> 01:33:28.197]  You know when I tell you something big's coming, something big's coming.
[01:33:29.258 --> 01:33:29.859]  I'm not hype.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.041]  We're the opposite.
[01:33:32.061 --> 01:33:34.423]  We're all cattle and no hat around here.
[01:33:35.444 --> 01:33:37.145]  Ain't wearing a hat, got cattle.
[01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:40.448]  So that's what comes down.
[01:33:41.589 --> 01:33:42.070]  Now I'm out.
[01:33:43.098 --> 01:33:45.319]  Riding the reins, which I wish I was doing.
[01:33:45.359 --> 01:33:47.421]  Checking the fences, I might be wearing a Stetson.
[01:33:48.101 --> 01:33:53.044]  But I don't, I'm not lucky enough to get to do that because my country is in so much damn peril.
[01:33:54.705 --> 01:33:56.966]  But I can't like Hank Williams Jr.
[01:33:56.986 --> 01:34:00.768]  I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.
[01:34:01.809 --> 01:34:03.550]  Country boy's work's just never done.
[01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:05.851]  Now the rest of the song goes.
[01:34:08.213 --> 01:34:10.734]  Good Lord has certainly met a lot of beautiful women out there, hasn't he?
[01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:17.808]  Harrison Smith is going to be taken over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:27.695]  And I'm tempted to pop back in, but, uh... I was here mentioning all this news.
[01:34:29.036 --> 01:34:30.537]  All this information that's unfolding.
[01:34:32.519 --> 01:34:35.081]  Hell, there's been so many people in this hotel room walking back and forth.
[01:34:35.661 --> 01:34:38.383]  I can't even remember what the last clip was I was going to play.
[01:34:38.403 --> 01:34:40.545]  What was the next clip, guys, I was going to get to?
[01:34:45.469 --> 01:34:46.730]  That's right, that's where I wanted to go.
[01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:50.653]  So, here's a real disappointment.
[01:34:52.654 --> 01:34:53.735]  Boris Johnson.
[01:34:54.836 --> 01:35:00.219]  Boris Johnson planned, he was his big patriot, got Nigel Farage's endorsement.
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:15.070]  Oh, he was for Brexit, all this, and he's now announced that Bill Gates will command him, this is in the news today, article on InfoWars.com with quotes of him, and that now that Britain, the UK, the next year,
[01:35:15.848 --> 01:35:19.270]  He's going to control the G7 chairmanship that rotates with the seven.
[01:35:19.851 --> 01:35:27.396]  That he's going to implement Bill Gates' plan for lockdowns, COVID tracking, and forced inoculations using the British military.
[01:35:28.637 --> 01:35:33.521]  Boris Johnson always looked like a trendy, fraudulent fop to me.
[01:35:33.541 --> 01:35:36.102]  I knew he'd been the mayor of London.
[01:35:37.463 --> 01:35:39.645]  This liberal who became a conservative.
[01:35:40.586 --> 01:35:42.287]  But he was the Trojan horse all along.
[01:35:43.147 --> 01:35:45.089]  Even Nigel Farage has come out and said this.
[01:35:45.874 --> 01:35:49.575]  You know, Sadiq Khan's better than this guy, because at least you know who he is.
[01:35:50.356 --> 01:35:53.177]  He's saying it's outrageous there's anti-vaxxers.
[01:35:53.517 --> 01:35:55.217]  Take any vaccine they've got.
[01:35:56.478 --> 01:36:01.579]  Well, you just had China release a vaccine leak that got 6,000 people sick and died.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:05.061]  You've got the Chinese vaccine killing people in Brazil.
[01:36:05.081 --> 01:36:05.821]  They just stopped it.
[01:36:06.481 --> 01:36:09.762]  You've got Bill Gates' vaccines killing people in South Korea in tests.
[01:36:10.022 --> 01:36:10.782]  They've had to halt them.
[01:36:11.123 --> 01:36:12.123]  I mean, these are dangerous.
[01:36:13.809 --> 01:36:18.030]  They can kill your ass with an autoimmune response and they're contaminated and everything else.
[01:36:19.090 --> 01:36:27.572]  And you even got when Trump tries to come out with a watered down Pfizer vaccine to end the lockdown and say, if you want it, you got it, but be careful, kids shouldn't take it.
[01:36:28.052 --> 01:36:31.333]  What he said, but here it is to stop.
[01:36:31.393 --> 01:36:32.053]  Don't be scared.
[01:36:32.093 --> 01:36:32.573]  You want this?
[01:36:32.593 --> 01:36:32.833]  Get it.
[01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:36.534]  Cuomo's like, do not take it.
[01:36:36.594 --> 01:36:37.454]  It's deadly dangerous.
[01:36:37.494 --> 01:36:41.455]  So CNN, Cuomo's brother, the governor,
[01:36:42.307 --> 01:36:42.807]  You've seen it.
[01:36:42.827 --> 01:36:44.108]  They're like, don't take the vaccines.
[01:36:44.388 --> 01:36:45.229]  Don't trust Trump.
[01:36:45.509 --> 01:36:48.771]  Whoopi Goldberg, don't take that shot Trump wants to put in you.
[01:36:49.912 --> 01:36:53.154]  But, Bill Gates' shot, you gotta take right now.
[01:36:53.775 --> 01:36:55.676]  And it's really good, I need you to take it.
[01:36:55.956 --> 01:36:56.777]  It's mRNA.
[01:36:56.797 --> 01:36:58.118]  It goes in and changes your DNA.
[01:36:58.438 --> 01:37:03.842]  I mean, how insanely obvious is... It's sick.
[01:37:05.463 --> 01:37:06.283]  It's disgusting.
[01:37:07.204 --> 01:37:08.065]  It's out of control.
[01:37:08.085 --> 01:37:09.466]  It's completely transparent.
[01:37:09.926 --> 01:37:11.327]  Because what they've done is suspended
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:12.621]  Common sense.
[01:37:12.641 --> 01:37:13.561]  They've suspended logic.
[01:37:13.602 --> 01:37:15.824]  Like, Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate.
[01:37:15.864 --> 01:37:16.444]  He's got a shot.
[01:37:17.185 --> 01:37:19.547]  Turns out his shots are the most dangerous of all the trials out there.
[01:37:20.127 --> 01:37:21.729]  Some of his tests, 100% get sick.
[01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:22.910]  The others, 80% get sick.
[01:37:22.930 --> 01:37:24.391]  20% go to the hospital.
[01:37:24.431 --> 01:37:24.832]  Some die.
[01:37:26.473 --> 01:37:28.035]  Trump comes out with a watered-down vaccine.
[01:37:28.095 --> 01:37:29.136]  I'm not even saying take that.
[01:37:29.156 --> 01:37:30.477]  Try to end the lockdown.
[01:37:30.497 --> 01:37:31.578]  Oh god, that's dangerous!
[01:37:31.998 --> 01:37:33.359]  Don't you take that, my lord!
[01:37:33.379 --> 01:37:34.360]  Vaccines are deadly!
[01:37:34.561 --> 01:37:36.322]  You don't just take something until it's safe!
[01:37:36.602 --> 01:37:38.224]  Says Fauci, my lord!
[01:37:39.016 --> 01:37:45.059]  You know, when they finally get the vaccine that's certified, it's given liability protection when it hurts you in the courts.
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.340]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:50.602]  So, here is Boris Johnson.
[01:37:51.122 --> 01:37:52.963]  May I say Judas Iscariot.
[01:37:53.323 --> 01:37:54.543]  May I say Benedict Arnold.
[01:37:54.683 --> 01:37:55.844]  What a piece of trash.
[01:37:56.044 --> 01:37:57.405]  It's preposterous!
[01:37:57.825 --> 01:37:59.726]  It's the word ridiculous.
[01:38:00.598 --> 01:38:01.939]  You don't want to take cyanide?
[01:38:02.039 --> 01:38:02.739]  Ridiculous.
[01:38:03.159 --> 01:38:05.540]  You don't want to chop your fingers off with a meat cleaver?
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:06.580]  Ridiculous.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.881]  Well, meat cleaver will hurt.
[01:38:08.001 --> 01:38:08.901]  I mean, I'll lose my fingers.
[01:38:09.421 --> 01:38:10.162]  Preposterous!
[01:38:10.202 --> 01:38:10.702]  Just do it!
[01:38:11.502 --> 01:38:12.142]  I have the word.
[01:38:12.202 --> 01:38:13.223]  It's ridiculous.
[01:38:13.243 --> 01:38:13.583]  Here he is.
[01:38:15.959 --> 01:38:20.162]  We're very much hoping that two things will start to come to our aid.
[01:38:20.762 --> 01:38:25.465]  Number one, the mass testing, the kind I just described, the rapid turnaround testing.
[01:38:25.965 --> 01:38:31.208]  And then the other thing is now the prospect, the realistic prospect of a vaccine.
[01:38:31.248 --> 01:38:40.034]  So you have a kind of, as it were, two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow.
[01:38:40.334 --> 01:38:41.915]  But I've got to stress
[01:38:42.495 --> 01:38:44.796]  That we're not out of the woods yet.
[01:38:45.516 --> 01:38:53.978]  It does still require everybody to follow the guidance, do the right thing to suppress the disease in the way that we all understand.
[01:38:54.298 --> 01:39:08.402]  I've got no inhibitions about getting a vaccine, but I totally encourage everybody who is eligible for a vaccine, the people who are most vulnerable, of course everybody should get a vaccine.
[01:39:08.442 --> 01:39:09.642]  Certainly I would say to everybody,
[01:39:10.402 --> 01:39:11.925]  Anti-vax is total nonsense.
[01:39:12.426 --> 01:39:13.547]  You should definitely get a vaccine.
[01:39:15.551 --> 01:39:17.093]  Total nonsense!
[01:39:18.089 --> 01:39:20.011]  Well, I'm here in Washington, D.C.
[01:39:20.571 --> 01:39:21.752]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:39:22.012 --> 01:39:24.174]  We're about to have Harrison Smith take over for the rest of the hour.
[01:39:24.194 --> 01:39:26.756]  And we've got a guest host in the fourth hour.
[01:39:26.816 --> 01:39:37.364]  Then Owen Schroer will be on the road broadcasting again with Harrison Smith with the caravan coming up out of the South into D.C., culminating tomorrow afternoon.
[01:39:37.384 --> 01:39:40.166]  And then, of course, the big Saturday rally for President Trump.
[01:39:41.423 --> 01:39:43.505]  Gigantic developments on the election fraud front.
[01:39:44.206 --> 01:39:52.554]  Just unspeakably amazing things with wonderful whistleblowers from inside the election systems, inside Dominion software, coming out with the fraud.
[01:39:53.635 --> 01:39:56.238]  Millions of votes flipped to Biden from Trump.
[01:39:57.018 --> 01:39:59.861]  Thank God Trump has not conceded.
[01:40:00.342 --> 01:40:01.783]  The deep state is so scared right now.
[01:40:01.823 --> 01:40:02.784]  They may pull anything.
[01:40:03.324 --> 01:40:04.446]  We're in such an incredible time.
[01:40:04.486 --> 01:40:05.747]  But let's go back to the big picture.
[01:40:08.112 --> 01:40:10.133]  It's like Day of the Dead here in D.C.
[01:40:10.893 --> 01:40:11.853]  I've been to D.C.
[01:40:11.873 --> 01:40:15.234]  20 times or more in my life.
[01:40:15.974 --> 01:40:25.136]  I came here several times when I was a child to the Smithsonian, and to go to the Capitol, and I've been here for political events 15, 16, 17 times.
[01:40:25.356 --> 01:40:26.497]  I guess more than that probably.
[01:40:27.677 --> 01:40:31.058]  You look out your window here, and I'm, because right over here I can see the
[01:40:32.096 --> 01:40:34.497]  Big Egyptian obelisk, the Washington Monument.
[01:40:34.857 --> 01:40:35.858]  Right over here is the White House.
[01:40:36.478 --> 01:40:37.718]  And there's just nobody out there.
[01:40:38.319 --> 01:40:39.939]  All the businesses are basically boarded up.
[01:40:40.619 --> 01:40:43.100]  Restaurants make you go order through a little hole in the wall.
[01:40:43.461 --> 01:40:44.581]  Then you get, you know, food.
[01:40:45.962 --> 01:40:46.962]  Everyone's totally scared.
[01:40:47.362 --> 01:40:48.403]  They say they're going bankrupt.
[01:40:49.283 --> 01:40:56.286]  And Klaus Schwab, the head of the Davos Group, the globalist, says, we're bankrupting you to make you go on a universal income.
[01:40:56.326 --> 01:40:58.226]  You're going to love it, which means we control you.
[01:40:58.787 --> 01:41:00.007]  We track everything you buy.
[01:41:00.047 --> 01:41:01.468]  We make you buy stuff from us.
[01:41:02.637 --> 01:41:09.982]  Just like the IMF World Bank goes into third world country, loans them a billion dollars, charges them 10 billion on interest, makes them buy stuff from them.
[01:41:11.042 --> 01:41:13.184]  And they've gotten away with it everywhere, so now they're doing it here.
[01:41:13.944 --> 01:41:17.706]  And you see CNN, ABC, any of these, these are just bought and paid for globalists.
[01:41:18.287 --> 01:41:20.088]  You get angry at them, you hate them, they're not Americans.
[01:41:20.468 --> 01:41:22.429]  They're propagandists, they're hired to lie.
[01:41:22.649 --> 01:41:26.572]  They're given a script, they read it off, and you wonder, why are they so evil looking?
[01:41:26.632 --> 01:41:27.492]  Why do I hate them?
[01:41:28.173 --> 01:41:29.674]  Why is there something disingenuous?
[01:41:31.906 --> 01:41:34.069]  Because you can't get real people to sell out other humans.
[01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:36.632]  They can be black, they can be white, they can be old, they can be young.
[01:41:37.273 --> 01:41:38.054]  You can't get them to do it.
[01:41:38.094 --> 01:41:44.762]  When you look at a Brian Stelter, or you look at a Jake Tapper, or you look at any of these people, these are the scum.
[01:41:45.503 --> 01:41:46.504]  These are the bottom of the barrel.
[01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:51.165]  These are the people that would sell out their own species and do this.
[01:41:51.245 --> 01:41:53.648]  So, Boris Johnson is in that category.
[01:41:53.768 --> 01:41:55.169]  Oh, it's ridiculous.
[01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:56.891]  Take whatever vaccine we've got.
[01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:58.853]  Meanwhile, don't take Trump's vaccine.
[01:41:59.073 --> 01:42:00.334]  It's totally deadly and it'll kill you.
[01:42:00.374 --> 01:42:01.696]  But, oh, Bill Gates' vaccine.
[01:42:03.538 --> 01:42:04.759]  I mean, they'll be on the same show.
[01:42:04.779 --> 01:42:05.920]  Like, don't take Trump's vaccine.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:06.961]  Take Bill Gates'.
[01:42:07.021 --> 01:42:07.362]  It's safe.
[01:42:09.104 --> 01:42:14.172]  Bill Gates wants you to beg and wait and get an ID card and get an app on your phone and then go get his.
[01:42:14.253 --> 01:42:15.034]  They've got it all planned.
[01:42:15.054 --> 01:42:16.757]  He'd be locked down for several years.
[01:42:16.997 --> 01:42:18.439]  It's a psychological warfare plan.
[01:42:20.029 --> 01:42:23.710]  And I know people that I've known for years who wear masks all the time and are scared.
[01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:27.772]  I just lovingly say, hey, you know, it's a larger plan of fear to hurt the economy.
[01:42:27.792 --> 01:42:28.712]  Can I show you an article?
[01:42:29.032 --> 01:42:30.733]  No, no, you're just scaring me.
[01:42:31.153 --> 01:42:31.413]  No, no.
[01:42:31.473 --> 01:42:34.214]  It's the people that made you wear the mask that are scaring you.
[01:42:34.454 --> 01:42:35.854]  They're the ones that are going to hurt you.
[01:42:36.435 --> 01:42:38.455]  They're the ones putting you in the back of the metaphysical van.
[01:42:38.695 --> 01:42:40.176]  They're the ones putting the gag over your face.
[01:42:40.416 --> 01:42:41.536]  They're the ones taking you to hell.
[01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:42.016]  Not me.
[01:42:44.337 --> 01:42:45.638]  Let's play that end of the clip again.
[01:42:45.678 --> 01:42:46.278]  Boris Johnson.
[01:42:48.294 --> 01:43:00.137]  Mainstream media bans all the thousands of scientists saying it's a fraud, blocks all the real data, blocks the nutraceuticals, blocks the therapeutics, and then says, all the scientists agree it's the end of the world.
[01:43:00.677 --> 01:43:04.097]  But Klaus Schwab says, oh, it's just a pretext for us to have a great reset.
[01:43:04.397 --> 01:43:06.078]  And Bill Gates says, oh, this is just a drill.
[01:43:06.678 --> 01:43:07.918]  The real attack's coming soon.
[01:43:07.938 --> 01:43:10.179]  A big bio-attack from terrorists.
[01:43:10.779 --> 01:43:11.679]  It's going to kill billions.
[01:43:13.188 --> 01:43:13.988]  And he's the terrorist.
[01:43:14.909 --> 01:43:23.752]  Once you lock down, once you take a tracker app, once they have drones in control, once they know they can actuary, it's safe to depopulate, they're gonna nail your ass.
[01:43:24.192 --> 01:43:30.595]  And listen, the fact that you don't fight back, I'm not talking to our audience, but the general public, means you deserve to die according to them.
[01:43:31.435 --> 01:43:37.978]  I, because I'm a Christian, cannot kill you just because you're stupid and not connected to God.
[01:43:37.998 --> 01:43:38.998]  God is the master of that.
[01:43:39.678 --> 01:43:39.898]  Okay?
[01:43:40.078 --> 01:43:40.979]  I don't hate you either.
[01:43:42.202 --> 01:43:47.466]  But I am here to make sure, you understand, I'm basically like David Rockefeller or Bill Gates, okay?
[01:43:48.847 --> 01:43:49.227]  Seriously.
[01:43:49.547 --> 01:43:50.728]  That's why they try to recruit my dad.
[01:43:50.788 --> 01:43:51.409]  It's all genetic.
[01:43:52.069 --> 01:43:53.270]  But I love God.
[01:43:53.370 --> 01:43:56.813]  You see, I told you when I was younger that Satan has tried to recruit me.
[01:43:56.913 --> 01:43:58.874]  I mean, I'm pretty evil, okay, if I want to be.
[01:43:59.134 --> 01:43:59.795]  I love God, though.
[01:43:59.815 --> 01:44:00.776]  I don't follow the evil path.
[01:44:01.036 --> 01:44:03.357]  But I can look directly into the enemy operation.
[01:44:04.018 --> 01:44:05.019]  I'm one of them, basically.
[01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:06.280]  And I'm being honest with you.
[01:44:07.344 --> 01:44:08.666]  I know what the Satanists are thinking.
[01:44:08.746 --> 01:44:10.629]  I know what their highest levels of Luciferians are doing.
[01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:13.995]  I've experienced stuff almost no one else has, I can assure you.
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.461]  And by the grace of God, I did not join Lucifer.
[01:44:18.121 --> 01:44:22.203]  But I'm here to tell you, I've seen the plan, I've been tempted, I've been shown it.
[01:44:22.644 --> 01:44:29.067]  And I've decided my body, my name, my family, everything is committed to God, and I'm going into the fire for you.
[01:44:29.447 --> 01:44:34.129]  But you have to listen to me carefully, and you have to understand that you have to be strong.
[01:44:34.769 --> 01:44:37.130]  You can't be the weak, stupid people they say you are.
[01:44:37.711 --> 01:44:39.011]  You can't serve Satan.
[01:44:39.852 --> 01:44:41.032]  You can't bow down to them.
[01:44:41.092 --> 01:44:44.334]  You can't sell others out, hoping you get a better social credit score.
[01:44:45.034 --> 01:44:49.217]  Because the real judge of the universe is watching you and will destroy you.
[01:44:49.637 --> 01:44:51.158]  And I hardly ever plug something this much.
[01:44:51.198 --> 01:44:52.239]  I meant to read this this week.
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:54.241]  Maybe tomorrow I get a good printout I can read.
[01:44:54.261 --> 01:44:54.921]  I'll put it on air.
[01:44:55.321 --> 01:44:59.424]  But Archbishop writes open letter to Trump, warning of COVID health dictatorship.
[01:44:59.985 --> 01:45:04.068]  He explains it is a satanic takeover for depopulation.
[01:45:04.268 --> 01:45:06.590]  Because Schwab says so!
[01:45:08.072 --> 01:45:12.714]  That's what's so insane is that the devil has to tell you what they're going to do.
[01:45:12.774 --> 01:45:15.315]  And he attacks the Pope, says the Pope's of the devil, everything.
[01:45:16.695 --> 01:45:18.596]  This is of the devil, man.
[01:45:18.656 --> 01:45:22.177]  This whole thing is diabolical, being of Diablo.
[01:45:22.778 --> 01:45:23.478]  Diabolical.
[01:45:23.638 --> 01:45:24.158]  Of the devil.
[01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:25.278]  Of the devil.
[01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:26.279]  Of the devil.
[01:45:26.519 --> 01:45:27.059]  Of the devil.
[01:45:27.239 --> 01:45:27.719]  Of the devil.
[01:45:28.099 --> 01:45:28.580]  Of the devil.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:29.180]  Of the devil.
[01:45:31.019 --> 01:45:33.181]  And we have a responsibility to warn other people.
[01:45:33.241 --> 01:45:34.662]  We have a responsibility to say no.
[01:45:34.682 --> 01:45:36.104]  We have a responsibility to fight this.
[01:45:36.945 --> 01:45:40.788]  And again, as this gets scarier and scarier, I'm not going to join Satan.
[01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:43.591]  Because that's the worst place to be.
[01:45:43.931 --> 01:45:49.816]  But man, I just want all of you to know that your denial of this puts you in extreme, grave danger.
[01:45:51.638 --> 01:45:52.979]  Danger of your immortal soul.
[01:45:53.982 --> 01:46:00.026]  And now it's so obvious with the pedophilia and the world government and the Satanism and all of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:00.847 --> 01:46:04.129]  And by the grace of God, God kept me from falling to the enemy.
[01:46:04.569 --> 01:46:09.212]  But I'm just here to tell you, you need to fear not who can kill your body, but he who can kill your soul.
[01:46:09.452 --> 01:46:16.797]  Don't fear he who can give you a bad social credit score or take your bank account, but fear he who can damn you to eternity to be with these people.
[01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:18.819]  You do not want to be spiritually cut off from God.
[01:46:19.159 --> 01:46:20.820]  You do not want to be thrown in with Satan.
[01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:23.762]  You do not want to serve these damn losers and they will be destroyed.
[01:46:23.922 --> 01:46:24.302]  No mistake.
[01:46:25.624 --> 01:46:27.646]  But we don't fight them because we want to have vengeance.
[01:46:27.686 --> 01:46:34.532]  We fight them because we want to protect the children and the innocents and give people their chance at free will as God and His Son demand.
[01:46:34.873 --> 01:46:35.713]  This is so real.
[01:46:36.314 --> 01:46:37.555]  Harrison Smith's going to take over.
[01:46:37.575 --> 01:46:41.259]  I'm going to go out to break with a little short clip of Boris Johnson.
[01:46:41.379 --> 01:46:42.580]  Oh, it's crazy.
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:43.281]  They're all dumb.
[01:46:44.363 --> 01:46:47.385]  And I just want to invite you all again to go to InfoWarsStore.com, because that's how we stay on air.
[01:46:47.405 --> 01:46:53.169]  That's how we have money to fight the hacks, hack attacks, and pay for all the bandwidth, which is exploding right now.
[01:46:53.249 --> 01:46:55.030]  Band.video, InfoWars.com.

[01:46:58.133 --> 01:47:01.195]  Huge sales right now on all of the amazing products.

[01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:05.738]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric formula everybody loves.
[01:47:05.778 --> 01:47:06.919]  Highest level of turmeric.
[01:47:07.379 --> 01:47:09.841]  And we have Alpha Power sold out for a year back in stock.
[01:47:09.861 --> 01:47:10.441]  Learn about that.
[01:47:10.561 --> 01:47:11.042]  Alpha Power.
[01:47:11.482 --> 01:47:12.563]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:13.487 --> 01:47:14.648]  Again, Owen Schroer is coming up.
[01:47:15.089 --> 01:47:15.529]  I'm coming up.
[01:47:15.549 --> 01:47:17.111]  We've got the big march coming up on Saturday.
[01:47:17.411 --> 01:47:18.692]  The caravan gets here tomorrow night.
[01:47:19.072 --> 01:47:20.414]  I love you and I salute you all.
[01:47:21.795 --> 01:47:28.481]  We'll go to break and then I know they've got a bunch of news on election fraud, Trump's tweets, huge news breaking with the whistleblowers coming out.
[01:47:29.082 --> 01:47:31.644]  We can defeat this, but we've got to take action and say no.
[01:47:31.664 --> 01:47:33.266]  I want to thank the crew for a great job.
[01:47:33.606 --> 01:47:35.848]  More reports coming to Infowars.com and Band.video.
[01:47:35.868 --> 01:47:38.531]  I'll be in the streets of DC tonight and other big announcements.
[01:47:39.778 --> 01:47:41.699]  Welcome back to the program, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:41.719 --> 01:47:42.940]  This is Harrison Smith.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.560]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:46.861]  I'm sitting in doing a little bit of quarterbacking here.
[01:47:46.881 --> 01:47:55.986]  It's all hands on deck here at InfoWars as we have the Stop the Steal caravan arriving in Raleigh, North Carolina.
[01:47:56.006 --> 01:47:57.847]  It looks like they're just pulling up now.
[01:47:57.907 --> 01:48:00.288]  Maybe we can put this up on screen, of course.
[01:48:00.948 --> 01:48:03.989]  Owen Schroyer in the top of the InfoWars battle tank.
[01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:11.810]  They're greeting supporters as he has done throughout the American South as the caravan charges towards Washington, D.C.
[01:48:12.370 --> 01:48:17.271]  Intent on taking the Capitol in peaceful protest this Saturday at noon.
[01:48:17.311 --> 01:48:24.132]  Of course, you can follow that progress at StopTheSteelCaravan.com or on Parler at StopTheSteelCaravan.
[01:48:24.752 --> 01:48:29.433]  It's been incredible to live vicariously through Owen and the rest of the InfoWars crew.
[01:48:29.953 --> 01:48:36.621]  As they charge through the American South, because in every single city you see crowds, and it seems like they're growing.
[01:48:36.641 --> 01:48:47.615]  It seems like with every stop, the crowd swells, the enthusiasm grows, the spirit enhances, and it's really a wonderful thing to see Americans come out in support.
[01:48:48.135 --> 01:49:16.437]  Even in the rain as they are here, Raleigh, North Carolina experiencing a bit of a downpour and yet that doesn't dampen the spirit of the info warriors out there standing up and telling the New World Order and the globalists that have, that are insisting quite dramatically that if we do not accept their dictates, we are the traitors and we must be dealt with and Americans around the country are standing up and saying, come and take it, come try us because we know what's been going on.
[01:49:16.477 --> 01:49:17.518]  We've seen the evidence.
[01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:20.800]  We've even seen the evidence of the covering up of the evidence.
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:24.443]  I had a friend call me today and said, you know, I was just searching on Google.
[01:49:24.463 --> 01:49:26.845]  I just searched election fraud and I went to the news tab.
[01:49:27.125 --> 01:49:28.226]  And actually, I think it was DuckDuckGo.
[01:49:28.246 --> 01:49:29.167]  I don't even think it was Google.
[01:49:29.547 --> 01:49:33.330]  And he said, you know, just one after another, it's there's no such thing as election fraud.
[01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:34.551]  Absolutely no election fraud.
[01:49:34.571 --> 01:49:36.032]  Never even heard of election fraud.
[01:49:36.052 --> 01:49:38.134]  Just one, you know, one after another, after another.
[01:49:38.154 --> 01:49:38.934]  And then all of a sudden it's
[01:49:39.995 --> 01:49:47.961]  A USPS worker who accused his overseer of election fraud recants his accusations.
[01:49:48.141 --> 01:49:49.602]  And of course that is untrue, right?
[01:49:49.622 --> 01:49:55.987]  This is the Project Veritas whistleblower that I believe the Washington Post said recanted his statement.
[01:49:56.007 --> 01:49:58.769]  And then he went on Project Veritas and said, I did no such thing.
[01:49:58.809 --> 01:50:04.474]  In fact, they have the recordings of him being interrogated and intimidated by federal agents.
[01:50:05.154 --> 01:50:10.158]  But my friend said, isn't it interesting that there was no report about the original accusations?
[01:50:10.198 --> 01:50:16.424]  There was no report about what he actually said was going on, but they will report that it was recanted.
[01:50:17.024 --> 01:50:19.706]  And so he said, you know, he said, I'm an unbiased observer.
[01:50:19.746 --> 01:50:21.908]  I'm just trying to find information about what's going on here.
[01:50:21.928 --> 01:50:33.278]  But you, if you just have an open mind and a high IQ, it's pretty easy to understand what's going on here when they don't report the accusations, but they do report that the accusations were recanted.
[01:50:33.758 --> 01:50:39.360]  There's a level of dishonesty that's impossible to ignore if you have any sort of decency in your heart.
[01:50:40.381 --> 01:50:50.165]  It's truly incredible, and we'll see the evidence of America standing up today, or this week rather, this weekend, Saturday at noon in Washington, D.C.
[01:50:50.185 --> 01:50:56.948]  They're doing everything they can to try to destroy this movement, but the American people are finally fed up.
[01:50:56.988 --> 01:51:02.550]  Maybe after four years of this nonsense, four years of us here at InfoWars pulling our hair out and
[01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:05.993]  Screaming to the sky, trying to tell people what's going on.
[01:51:06.033 --> 01:51:10.598]  It seems like the globalists, the New World Order, they've overplayed their hands once and for all.
[01:51:11.238 --> 01:51:13.420]  And we're starting to see the pushback.
[01:51:13.981 --> 01:51:18.065]  And it's just exciting to be a part of all this and to be in the middle of all this.
[01:51:19.426 --> 01:51:21.228]  Truly such a privilege.
[01:51:21.308 --> 01:51:25.091]  I would never, I would not choose to be alive in any other time period.
[01:51:25.111 --> 01:51:33.738]  This is such a crucial moment in history and it's amazing to be here with you on InfoWars at the heart of the resistance against this global tyranny.
[01:51:34.558 --> 01:51:37.521]  It's so incredible and you know we have an article on InfoWars.com
[01:51:39.215 --> 01:51:44.837]  Actually published a few days ago, but it's called Joe Biden's COVID-19 Martial Law Plan Revealed.
[01:51:45.357 --> 01:51:47.418]  And I've got a little secret to tell you.
[01:51:47.438 --> 01:51:50.799]  This is not exclusive reporting from InfoWars.
[01:51:50.859 --> 01:51:52.520]  Actually, we didn't break this story.
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:55.981]  The person who broke this story was Joe Biden himself.
[01:51:56.621 --> 01:52:00.967]  We didn't have to go in and find secret communications detailing all this.
[01:52:01.027 --> 01:52:04.652]  We don't have to speculate and wonder about what they're going to do.
[01:52:05.032 --> 01:52:12.763]  Simply reporting on the facts that they present to us paints an incredibly stark and troubling picture.
[01:52:13.183 --> 01:52:13.884]  So we didn't have to...
[01:52:14.545 --> 01:52:15.886]  Again, do we not have to speculate?
[01:52:16.246 --> 01:52:17.067]  We don't have to guess?
[01:52:17.407 --> 01:52:19.849]  We don't have to surmise from little hints that they're giving us?
[01:52:19.869 --> 01:52:28.736]  They are literally just telling us, we will lock down the country, we will destroy this economy, we will enslave you, we will muzzle you.
[01:52:28.797 --> 01:52:39.105]  I mean, this guy, Joe Biden, who is pretending to be the office of the President-elect, the President-elect, by dictate, by fiat, Joe Biden, our dictator.
[01:52:40.786 --> 01:52:41.846]  He's just come out and said it.
[01:52:41.886 --> 01:52:44.607]  He's just come out and said, we're going to muzzle you.
[01:52:44.948 --> 01:52:57.052]  That's pretty much the only thing I've heard him talk about since he appointed himself or since he was appointed by our betters, our leaders, our superlatives there in the mainstream media.
[01:52:58.527 --> 01:52:59.227]  But it's just incredible.
[01:52:59.247 --> 01:53:01.849]  I mean, some of these headlines, they beg your belief.
[01:53:02.189 --> 01:53:03.229]  This is from CNBC.
[01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:06.111]  Biden COVID advisor says U.S.
[01:53:06.171 --> 01:53:10.433]  lockdown of four to six weeks could control pandemic.
[01:53:11.334 --> 01:53:12.434]  OK, that's dumb.
[01:53:12.574 --> 01:53:13.595]  It's it's dangerous.
[01:53:13.735 --> 01:53:16.216]  It's not correct, but that at least makes sense.
[01:53:16.616 --> 01:53:17.677]  Let me finish this headline.
[01:53:18.666 --> 01:53:19.046]  That's right.
[01:53:19.066 --> 01:53:21.228]  They're going to revive the economy by shutting down the economy.
[01:53:21.248 --> 01:53:21.669]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:53:21.749 --> 01:53:22.269]  War is peace.
[01:53:22.309 --> 01:53:22.770]  We are in 1984.
[01:53:37.723 --> 01:53:38.544]  It's unbelievable.
[01:53:38.584 --> 01:53:43.449]  And then, of course, they say other things like, uh, we will reignite this economy.
[01:53:43.489 --> 01:53:44.931]  We'll kickstart this economy.
[01:53:45.331 --> 01:53:48.234]  Meanwhile, they're stepping on the economy's throat, right?
[01:53:48.254 --> 01:53:51.477]  This is like somebody saying, saying, I'm going to help you stand up.
[01:53:51.517 --> 01:53:57.103]  I'm going to help you get to your feet while they are stepping on your throat, while they're standing on your chest.
[01:53:57.183 --> 01:53:58.585]  It's like, just get off.
[01:53:59.065 --> 01:54:00.486]  And I can stand up on my own.
[01:54:00.546 --> 01:54:06.931]  I don't need your help if you're the one stepping on my throat and telling me you're my hero.
[01:54:07.091 --> 01:54:08.572]  It's utterly absurd.
[01:54:09.233 --> 01:54:24.704]  But we are really entering a world now with this COVID-19 and the control that it has allowed, the New World Order, the globalists, this cabal of elites that control the media and the Democratic Party and Joe Biden and even the blue-blood Republicans.
[01:54:24.944 --> 01:54:25.825]  We are entering into
[01:54:27.065 --> 01:54:28.866]  Maybe I'll call it a dark winter.
[01:54:28.886 --> 01:54:35.807]  You know, if they succeed, if they actually get into office, it will be a dark winter and the winter will be an endless one.
[01:54:35.828 --> 01:54:39.529]  This will be Narnia before Aslan, if you will.
[01:54:39.609 --> 01:54:47.371]  The endless winter, the endless cold, snow-covered death of COVID-19 lockdowns and what they've been able to
[01:54:48.331 --> 01:55:17.512]  Justify for themselves what they've been able to trick the American people into accepting although maybe I speak a little bit too early because as I'm talking we have this live view of North Carolina rally the the rally and rally there at the state capitol in North Carolina with the Infowars battle tank arriving there and it's just massive crowds and it's pouring rain so I'm a little distracted here I'm talking about how you know Americans are all falling for this and here I have evidence in front of my eyes that
[01:55:18.152 --> 01:55:20.453]  It's not everybody, not by a long shot.
[01:55:20.493 --> 01:55:25.054]  There are millions of us out there that understand the BS of COVID-19.
[01:55:25.094 --> 01:55:29.875]  We understand that they've been desirous of control for so long.
[01:55:30.055 --> 01:55:35.916]  They're so desperate to put you in a noose of whatever design that they can create.
[01:55:35.957 --> 01:55:45.179]  And COVID-19 just happens to be the excuse that they require, happens to be the justification that they can roll out to do what they've always planned on doing.
[01:55:46.039 --> 01:55:51.373]  It's truly amazing, truly is a dark world, a brave new world that we will be entering into.
[01:55:51.393 --> 01:55:52.395]  And once again...
[01:55:53.683 --> 01:55:56.025]  InfoWars, I admit, we didn't break this story.
[01:55:56.525 --> 01:55:59.748]  In fact, all of the details are very well documented.
[01:55:59.828 --> 01:56:02.550]  It can all be found at buildingbackbetter.com.
[01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:05.212]  That's Joe Biden's transition website.
[01:56:05.292 --> 01:56:14.300]  That's, of course, the New World Order, World Economic Forum, You'll Own Nothing and You'll Like It, Great Reset slogan, Build Back Better, right?
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:17.382]  They're going to rebuild the earth after having destroyed it themselves.
[01:56:17.822 --> 01:56:18.763]  But they say things like this.
[01:56:19.183 --> 01:56:20.945]  Social distancing is not a light switch.
[01:56:21.145 --> 01:56:21.806]  It's a dial.
[01:56:22.406 --> 01:56:33.955]  President-elect Biden will direct the CDC to provide specific evidence-based guidance for how to turn the dial up or down relative to the level of risk and degree of viral spread in a community.
[01:56:33.995 --> 01:56:34.395]  That's right.
[01:56:34.435 --> 01:56:37.197]  You won't just be either enslaved or not enslaved.
[01:56:37.217 --> 01:56:43.882]  They have a nice, fancy dial to increase or decrease the level of tyranny that they'll subject you to.
[01:56:44.302 --> 01:56:46.324]  And of course, that's all based on COVID.
[01:56:46.644 --> 01:56:47.764]  And it's for your health.
[01:56:47.825 --> 01:56:51.606]  And if you don't obey and bow down to them, you're the bad guy.
[01:56:51.866 --> 01:56:52.907]  You're the traitorous one.
[01:56:52.947 --> 01:56:54.727]  You must believe them wholeheartedly.
[01:56:54.927 --> 01:56:55.668]  You must support them.
[01:56:55.688 --> 01:56:59.529]  It's not enough anymore that you just allow them to do what they want.
[01:56:59.569 --> 01:57:01.350]  Now you have to come out and support.
[01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:07.572]  You see lists on CNN saying, these are the Senate Republicans who have not congratulated the president yet.
[01:57:07.632 --> 01:57:10.233]  It's not enough just to genuflect now.
[01:57:10.273 --> 01:57:12.214]  You must assist in their takeover.
[01:57:12.714 --> 01:57:13.895]  We won't stand for it, folks.
[01:57:16.218 --> 01:57:18.119]  On top of the InfoWars battle tank.
[01:57:32.624 --> 01:57:40.851]  Giving a PowerPoint presentation in the pouring rain to a crowd outside the statehouse there in Raleigh, North Carolina.
[01:57:42.253 --> 01:57:51.981]  This is truly an incredible image and it's an incredible crowd that we're seeing gathered there in protest, in solidarity with the Stop the Steal caravan.
[01:57:54.483 --> 01:57:55.605]  Must be having the time of his life.
[01:57:55.625 --> 01:58:04.421]  I mean, this is the time, the place, the event that Owen Schroer was made for, and he's been leading the troops in the
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:15.245]  Inevitable charge towards Washington DC, towards our nation capital, to undo the corrupt theft of our sovereign election.
[01:58:15.666 --> 01:58:22.850]  So there he is with a poster board showing the graph with the mysterious jump that occurred at 3 to 4 a.m.
[01:58:23.190 --> 01:58:28.654]  in both Wisconsin and Michigan, exactly the same time.
[01:58:28.794 --> 01:58:30.855]  Very suspicious activities there.
[01:58:32.566 --> 01:58:36.969]  There he is giving a speech in a rally to a bunch of high-spirited InfoWarriors.
[01:58:36.989 --> 01:58:47.356]  Of course, you can follow the trajectory of the cavalry of the Stop the Steal Caravan at StopTheStealCaravan.com and on Parler at StopTheStealCaravan.
[01:58:47.416 --> 01:58:52.880]  And I do hope that you can make whatever sacrifice you need to to be in Washington, D.C.
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:54.521]  this Saturday at noon.
[01:58:54.801 --> 01:59:01.145]  We already have multiple teams there from InfoWars on the ground getting ready for what
[01:59:01.886 --> 01:59:02.226]  We're good.
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:20.541]  Owen out there leading the charge.
[01:59:20.901 --> 01:59:23.883]  Alex Jones embedded in Washington, D.C.
[01:59:24.163 --> 01:59:29.426]  The incredible crew that's all working double time here as we are strained to the nines.
[01:59:29.987 --> 01:59:33.369]  All of it is sponsored by you going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:33.409 --> 01:59:39.232]  We cannot do this without you and we thank you so much for allowing us to do this, helping us to do this.
[01:59:39.252 --> 01:59:47.978]  And you know, I know Owen has the same spirit many of us do here at InfoWars where everywhere he goes there are crowds of
[01:59:48.698 --> 02:00:02.368]  Adoration, crowds of admirers, crowds of info warriors out there to celebrate with us and to share their story and to talk about, you know, how Alex woke them up and to just say, you know, we love y'all, keep fighting.
[02:00:02.408 --> 02:00:03.349]  And it's so uplifting.
[02:00:03.389 --> 02:00:04.330]  It's so encouraging.
[02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:08.613]  It's so invigorating to see these crowds because they've cut us off from you on social media.
[02:00:08.653 --> 02:00:09.574]  They cut us off from you.
[02:00:10.354 --> 02:00:15.735]  In real life, through COVID-19 and being able to gather in large numbers, and it's so uplifting.
[02:00:16.255 --> 02:00:17.416]  But it's not about us, right?
[02:00:17.456 --> 02:00:18.436]  Owen doesn't get a big head.
[02:00:18.456 --> 02:00:20.316]  He's not like, all these people love me!
[02:00:20.777 --> 02:00:21.417]  I'm great!
[02:00:21.457 --> 02:00:22.477]  And they think I'm great!
[02:00:23.157 --> 02:00:28.278]  We all recognize we are simply fulfilling a responsibility that we have as American citizens.
[02:00:28.318 --> 02:00:38.581]  We're just doing what we should all be doing, which is trying to spread the word, trying to spread the truth, trying to reveal the corruption and bring back liberty to this country, which
[02:00:39.888 --> 02:00:48.696]  I almost called it a God-forsaken country, and looking around today's it does seem like God has forsaken us, but we know that there are... we are legion!
[02:00:48.716 --> 02:00:58.404]  Maybe I shouldn't quote that, that's what a demon told Jesus, but what it means is that we are numerous, we are all-encompassing, we are everywhere.
[02:00:58.585 --> 02:01:04.330]  Us info warriors, us who love liberty, us who stand for America and what America was founded to be.
[02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:08.799]  And it's so invigorating, but it's not about us.
[02:01:09.179 --> 02:01:11.199]  It's not about our own personal aggrandizement.
[02:01:11.239 --> 02:01:15.220]  It's not about, oh, this is a great opportunity for us to seize the spotlight.
[02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:17.121]  It's about somebody needs to do this.
[02:01:17.321 --> 02:01:23.342]  It's about this being a necessary activity for the sake of the survival of our republic.
[02:01:23.882 --> 02:01:25.822]  And we don't take it lightly.
[02:01:25.882 --> 02:01:28.363]  We don't take it flippantly.
[02:01:28.743 --> 02:01:32.404]  We take it very seriously as a responsibility that every American has.
[02:01:32.964 --> 02:01:37.167]  Quote the great Dr. Ron Paul, liberty is a responsibility.
[02:01:37.227 --> 02:01:40.109]  I should say to paraphrase, liberty is a responsibility.
[02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:41.590]  It's not license to do whatever you want.
[02:01:41.650 --> 02:01:42.670]  It's a responsibility.
[02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:46.793]  It's a requirement to live up to the standards that liberty requires.
[02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:48.374]  And that's all we're trying to do here.
[02:01:48.394 --> 02:01:50.976]  And so we thank you for helping us to do that because without you...
[02:01:51.786 --> 02:01:54.807]  We wouldn't be here and without you we won't be here much longer.
[02:01:54.827 --> 02:01:58.949]  So please go to InfoWarsStore.com and help support us and help support everything that we do.
[02:01:59.569 --> 02:02:01.450]  I just got some new stories here.
[02:02:01.930 --> 02:02:07.212]  One's from Fox News, another one from a local Fox station, but they're pretty incredible and I'd like to read them for you.
[02:02:07.272 --> 02:02:07.813]  Here's the headline.
[02:02:08.353 --> 02:02:15.196]  Pennsylvania Court says Secretary of State lacked authority to change deadline two days before Election Day.
[02:02:16.035 --> 02:02:27.443]  They say a Pennsylvania judge ruled in favor of the Trump campaign Thursday, ordering the state may not count ballots where the voters needed to provide proof of identification and failed to do so by November 9th.
[02:02:27.523 --> 02:02:35.549]  State law says that voters have until six days after the election, this year that was November 9th, to cure problems regarding a lack of proof of identification.
[02:02:35.649 --> 02:02:44.455]  After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that mail-in ballots could be accepted three days after Election Day, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State, Kathy Buchvar,
[02:02:45.518 --> 02:02:52.922]  Submitted guidance that said proof of identification could be provided up until November 12th, which is six days from the ballot acceptance deadline.
[02:02:53.102 --> 02:02:53.662]  Stay with me here.
[02:02:53.682 --> 02:02:55.463]  I know it's a lot of numbers, but it's important.
[02:02:56.204 --> 02:02:59.165]  That guidance was issued two days before Election Day.
[02:03:00.666 --> 02:03:01.166]  Here's the quote.
[02:03:01.206 --> 02:03:03.627]  Basically what it's saying is that she's a dirty cheater!
[02:03:21.296 --> 02:03:24.079]  To summarize for you, they're cheaters.
[02:03:24.139 --> 02:03:27.842]  The Democrats are cheaters and fairly shameless ones at that.
[02:03:28.123 --> 02:03:30.185]  And something we've talked about for a long time here.
[02:03:30.545 --> 02:03:38.213]  You know, if you, the thing I keep saying is, you know, if Tucker Carlson were to host a presidential debate, we all know what his bias is, right?
[02:03:38.253 --> 02:03:39.974]  We all know who he would favor.
[02:03:40.115 --> 02:03:44.219]  And yet, if you were to put him as the moderator of a presidential debate, you know he would
[02:03:44.719 --> 02:03:46.721]  Behave completely equitably, right?
[02:03:46.781 --> 02:03:55.090]  He would not favor his preferred candidate because he's got a little thing, a little piece of his heart that the Democrats are missing.
[02:03:55.851 --> 02:03:57.893]  And we call it here in America honor.
[02:03:57.913 --> 02:04:01.136]  It's a little bit of honor that is absent.
[02:04:02.037 --> 02:04:05.841]  There's a little honor shaped hole missing in the souls of the Democrats.
[02:04:07.148 --> 02:04:26.404]  I mean, I'm sure, you know, as a little kid playing board games with your siblings, at some point you were, you were very sneaky and clever and you, you slipped an extra hundred dollar bill out of the Monopoly banker's pile and felt, felt very, uh, uh, you know, proud of yourself for tricking, uh, you know, the others.
[02:04:26.444 --> 02:04:35.732]  But then was that victory fulfilling or were you left with sort of an empty hollowness inside knowing that your victory was not
[02:04:37.062 --> 02:04:37.842]  Correctly won.
[02:04:38.083 --> 02:04:39.523]  It was cheating.
[02:04:39.563 --> 02:04:40.944]  It was conniving.
[02:04:40.984 --> 02:04:42.585]  It was wrong.
[02:04:42.945 --> 02:04:43.165]  Right?
[02:04:43.926 --> 02:04:47.668]  And most decent people feel guilt about that.
[02:04:47.708 --> 02:04:48.448]  They feel shame.
[02:04:48.468 --> 02:04:52.090]  They feel bad knowing that they've won through cheating.
[02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:53.511]  Democrats don't feel that.
[02:04:53.751 --> 02:04:55.332]  They have no such compunction.
[02:04:55.652 --> 02:04:58.313]  They don't feel bad about cheating.
[02:04:58.393 --> 02:04:58.854]  They think
[02:04:59.474 --> 02:05:00.375]  It's about power.
[02:05:00.875 --> 02:05:08.701]  In their minds, forget honor, forget following the rules, forget obeying the law, it's about what can I do and I'm going to do that.
[02:05:08.841 --> 02:05:11.823]  How can I cheat and will I get caught?
[02:05:12.403 --> 02:05:19.448]  And there's no guilt, there's no feeling bad about this, there's no shame in the fact that they didn't win legitimately.
[02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.970]  They just want to win.
[02:05:21.010 --> 02:05:24.752]  They don't care how they do it and it's despicable, quite honestly.
[02:05:24.932 --> 02:05:27.995]  In the last segment I talked about the fact that they now are talking about the
[02:05:29.736 --> 02:05:30.257]  What are they called?
[02:05:30.277 --> 02:05:32.778]  They're turning the dial of COVID-19.
[02:05:33.018 --> 02:05:36.360]  The lockdowns aren't an on and off switch, it's a dial.
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:44.604]  And we'll turn the dial of tyranny up when we so choose, and we'll turn the dial of tyranny down when you are behaving yourself.
[02:05:45.045 --> 02:05:48.306]  And then the crew runs in with this amazing article.
[02:05:48.426 --> 02:05:50.788]  El Paso County moved to level orange!
[02:05:51.718 --> 02:05:55.299]  That's safe at home, high risk status on the state's dial.
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:09.605]  So now we have a nice elementary level colored dial that we can now have the government tell us what's safe and what's not by giving us a nice little Crayola colored dial.
[02:06:09.785 --> 02:06:15.368]  Just like the terror dial kept us in fear following September 11th, now we have the COVID dial.
[02:06:15.888 --> 02:06:20.309]  And so, I don't know, maybe we're green on the terrorist dial, but we're red on COVID.
[02:06:20.569 --> 02:06:21.269]  What does that mean?
[02:06:21.289 --> 02:06:29.651]  It means we can go outside, but we have to wear a mask, or if the terrorist dial is up, we have to stay inside, but the COVID dial's down so we can have Thanksgiving this year.
[02:06:30.071 --> 02:06:31.051]  It's absurdity.
[02:06:31.171 --> 02:06:32.031]  It's ridiculous.
[02:06:32.231 --> 02:06:33.732]  It's a show.
[02:06:33.772 --> 02:06:34.432]  It's an illusion.
[02:06:34.872 --> 02:06:39.853]  It's them attempting to control your life, plain and simple.
[02:06:41.192 --> 02:06:44.415]  No, I'm not being facetious and I'm not being exaggerating.
[02:06:44.716 --> 02:06:47.478]  I'm not exaggerating when I say they're canceling Thanksgiving.
[02:06:47.558 --> 02:06:51.882]  Chicago issues 30-day stay-at-home advisory cancels Thanksgiving.
[02:06:51.922 --> 02:06:54.004]  That's the headline from Zero Hedge.
[02:06:54.044 --> 02:07:01.352]  Of course, California didn't cancel Thanksgiving, but they did say things like, you can only spend two hours together and you can only have two people
[02:07:01.952 --> 02:07:03.033]  Uh, around the same time.
[02:07:03.373 --> 02:07:05.474]  Which is great, you'll just, just microwave your turkey.
[02:07:05.495 --> 02:07:10.278]  Hey, if you're trying to cook a turkey in two waves, in two hours, just go ahead and throw it in the microwave.
[02:07:10.458 --> 02:07:17.323]  Nothing, nothing more American than a microwaved turkey in two hours with your grandmother hugging her through a plastic sheet.
[02:07:17.703 --> 02:07:22.046]  This is hell, and they are gleefully leading us down the path towards destruction.
[02:07:22.086 --> 02:07:27.910]  But folks, they won't succeed as long as enough of you stand up, share this information, share this spirit.
[02:07:28.130 --> 02:07:28.931]  Just tell people, hey,
[02:07:29.611 --> 02:07:30.853]  They don't control your life.
[02:07:31.134 --> 02:07:33.939]  They can't tell you what to wear or who to associate with.
[02:07:34.279 --> 02:07:37.044]  This is America, whether they like it or not.
[02:07:37.364 --> 02:07:39.308]  But it won't be much longer if you don't stand up.
[02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:41.331]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:43.421]  Alright, you've got me for an entire hour because
[02:08:04.466 --> 02:08:08.648]  Alex is on the road, and when Alex is on the road, things happen.
[02:08:08.668 --> 02:08:14.732]  Owen's already up in Washington, and we're all going to see what happens on Saturday.
[02:08:14.792 --> 02:08:15.973]  I hope the weather is better.
[02:08:15.993 --> 02:08:18.394]  Right now it's kind of a rainout.
[02:08:19.275 --> 02:08:28.480]  Whenever it's a rainout, like on an election day, that tends to favor the Patriots because the, you know, the Sunshine Patriots only come out when the sun is shining.
[02:08:29.315 --> 02:08:35.037]  And the real Patriots will come out in rain or snow or hail or anything else.
[02:08:35.738 --> 02:08:44.341]  And we can see that right now with Owen and the Infowars gang and all the other Patriots that are already up there, you know, even days ahead of time.
[02:08:45.582 --> 02:08:49.183]  I've been following this naturally.
[02:08:49.283 --> 02:08:53.625]  Big Tech and the mainstream media is doing everything that they can to play this rally down.
[02:08:54.709 --> 02:09:01.472]  Apparently it doesn't have the right kind of official permit, the Saturday Assembly.
[02:09:02.173 --> 02:09:13.318]  But it's funny that that never seemed to bother anybody when it was BLM or Antifa burning down buildings or rampaging against courthouses.
[02:09:14.178 --> 02:09:22.402]  But you let a group of patriots get together to wave the American flag, and suddenly there's a big concern about the permitting process.
[02:09:23.785 --> 02:09:35.974]  It'll remain to be seen what happens with the police, you know, whether they'll let any kind of a stage be set up, or all it's going to be is a big truck rally, you know, a Trump train.
[02:09:36.835 --> 02:09:45.160]  And if it's a Trump train, if they don't allow the people to assemble peaceably, then maybe it will just be a big Trump train that'll shut Washington down.
[02:09:45.541 --> 02:09:52.746]  But one way or another, you know, the point is to get the attention of the traitor press
[02:09:53.519 --> 02:10:15.688]  The mainstream media that is colluding with, you know, with the Democrats and big tech to stifle any positive news about Trump's fraud investigation and amplify any news about the so-called Biden transition team, you know, the fake president-elect.
[02:10:15.848 --> 02:10:19.470]  I'm just as much a president-elect as Joe Biden is.
[02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:27.343]  You know, there's no president-elect until the electoral college meets.
[02:10:28.103 --> 02:10:33.246]  And until that happens, you know, there is no president-elect.
[02:10:33.706 --> 02:10:40.409]  That is strictly mainstream media, and that now includes Fox News, unfortunately.
[02:10:41.170 --> 02:10:43.831]  That is just mainstream media gaslighting.
[02:10:44.311 --> 02:10:45.932]  That's just the brainwash.
[02:10:46.532 --> 02:10:49.814]  But I have to wonder, you know, how effective is the brainwashing
[02:10:50.587 --> 02:10:57.048]  After four years of the mainstream media telling us that, you know, that Trump was a Russian spy, a traitor.
[02:10:57.749 --> 02:11:04.810]  Then he was a Ukrainian spy and a traitor, which kind of doesn't make sense because Ukraine and Russia are at war.
[02:11:04.930 --> 02:11:05.730]  But never mind.
[02:11:06.290 --> 02:11:16.012]  You know, to the dim bulbs that are the voting masses of the Democrat Party, it's interchangeable.
[02:11:16.192 --> 02:11:16.912]  He's a traitor.
[02:11:17.052 --> 02:11:19.313]  Russia, Ukraine, who cares?
[02:11:20.043 --> 02:11:24.264]  But then it went to, he brought in the Wuhan virus.
[02:11:24.305 --> 02:11:27.085]  You know, the virus is all Trump's fault.
[02:11:27.286 --> 02:11:34.368]  All 200,000 that they say died from this virus, every one of them is on Trump's hands.
[02:11:34.488 --> 02:11:40.830]  Then it was into the election cycle, and Trump is going to lose by 10, 12, 15 points.
[02:11:41.590 --> 02:11:42.891]  Pure suppression polls.
[02:11:43.718 --> 02:11:52.040]  You know, geared to disheartened Trump supporters to make them not feel like it would make a difference if they voted, but still they voted.
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:53.140]  Okay?
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:56.981]  So how much power does the mainstream media really have anymore?
[02:11:57.901 --> 02:12:02.942]  Or is it a case of like a boomerang effect or a reverse psychology effect?
[02:12:03.582 --> 02:12:12.684]  You know, if the mainstream media says the sky is blue, I think most people will go outside and look because they'll assume that they're lying at this point.
[02:12:13.850 --> 02:12:24.779]  Not to mention all the people that are right in the middle that have been red-pilled, as Owen's been pointing out, massively red-pilled by this outcome of this fraud.
[02:12:25.519 --> 02:12:28.121]  Seeing it is just a new thing.
[02:12:28.141 --> 02:12:30.543]  We'll continue on the other side of the break.
[02:12:31.764 --> 02:12:36.628]  Now here's the message to Trump Nation, to patriotic Americans.
[02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:40.651]  It's all a gaslight if you haven't figured it out yet.
[02:12:41.548 --> 02:12:45.409]  It's all a massive fake news gaslight.
[02:12:46.570 --> 02:12:49.651]  Trump won massively in the last election.
[02:12:50.151 --> 02:12:52.632]  He even won massively in the swing states.
[02:12:53.452 --> 02:13:03.375]  This is why the Democrats who a lot of them, you know, they might be vicious and they might be extremely partisan, but a lot of them aren't really aren't that smart.
[02:13:04.256 --> 02:13:05.576]  Like Stacey Abrams.
[02:13:06.542 --> 02:13:13.268]  She thought she could become, you know, she could win in Georgia by hauling in 50,000 last minute votes.
[02:13:13.968 --> 02:13:16.930]  Unfortunately for her, she missed the mark.
[02:13:17.011 --> 02:13:19.733]  She needed, you know, 70 or 80,000 votes.
[02:13:20.353 --> 02:13:23.896]  Still, she calls herself, you know, the legitimate governor of Georgia.
[02:13:24.517 --> 02:13:30.341]  Well, before the election, Stacey Abrams made visits to all of these key swing states.
[02:13:31.022 --> 02:13:35.165]  And I think that the message that she sent was, you're going to need more than 50,000 votes.
[02:13:36.852 --> 02:13:46.695]  But what they couldn't foresee was that Trump might win Pennsylvania, not by 50,000 votes, but by seven or 800,000 votes.
[02:13:46.755 --> 02:13:51.356]  You know, by almost 300,000 votes in Michigan.
[02:13:52.156 --> 02:13:56.477]  This sent the Democrats into total panic mode.
[02:13:56.637 --> 02:14:06.200]  This caused them to lose their minds in terms of committing a fraud that is so vast that it would be impossible to conceal it.
[02:14:07.159 --> 02:14:18.505]  And the messages that we're getting out from the Trump legal team, and now from Trump himself, tweeting about the massive size of this fraud, they know what's going on.
[02:14:18.785 --> 02:14:21.447]  They have the evidence.
[02:14:21.647 --> 02:14:24.128]  They have the computer forensic analysts.
[02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:34.314]  Everything that you've been seeing about these vote switches and vote disappearances, it's not only true, it leaves a forensic trail.
[02:14:35.137 --> 02:14:45.405]  You know, these Dominion machines that have the port on the side that you can stick a thumb drive in, well, you can't do that without leaving a trail.
[02:14:45.425 --> 02:14:52.550]  You know, it leaves a forensic trail and analysts are finding all of this evidence.
[02:14:53.230 --> 02:15:03.378]  So Biden right now is taking two days off to go to Delaware and probably his team is wondering how they're going to counter the fraud, the fraud charges.
[02:15:03.956 --> 02:15:15.705]  You know, two weeks before the election, the Tony Bobulinski interview happened, and this was during the reveal of the Hunter Biden laptop from hell.
[02:15:16.326 --> 02:15:28.395]  Then Tony Bobulinski on top of it saying, I had two meetings with Joe Biden himself, along with Hunter Biden and his brother, James Biden, Joe's brother, James.
[02:15:30.124 --> 02:15:34.125]  The mainstream media completely just blockaded the news.
[02:15:34.745 --> 02:15:48.048]  So Bob Uelinski, who is a stellar witness, you know, a fact witness, an eyewitness, a partner in the Hunter Biden schemes at that time, the news media said, look, it worked.
[02:15:48.428 --> 02:15:58.990]  We just blocked it and we went straight to the election without the Biden voters knowing anything about it, about the laptop or Tony Bob Uelinski.
[02:16:00.014 --> 02:16:05.355]  Then they obviously also knew that Pfizer was going to be coming out with the vaccine.
[02:16:05.816 --> 02:16:07.256]  They waited on that.
[02:16:07.776 --> 02:16:11.377]  They knew that the unemployment numbers would be great.
[02:16:11.437 --> 02:16:12.477]  They waited on that.
[02:16:12.577 --> 02:16:16.858]  So, obviously, it's no secret, the media is 100% in the tank.
[02:16:17.299 --> 02:16:26.421]  But what they've been learning from this is to have a little bit too much faith in just how airtight their control of the media is.
[02:16:27.253 --> 02:16:31.036]  Because they've been just trying to say there's no fraud.
[02:16:31.717 --> 02:16:34.219]  You know, there's no evidence of fraud.
[02:16:34.499 --> 02:16:36.380]  They were sticking with that for a few days.
[02:16:37.061 --> 02:16:46.288]  But it's not working because they have to have some Republicans on shows like with Stephanopoulos and others, and they're getting it.
[02:16:46.589 --> 02:16:47.730]  You know, both barrels.
[02:16:48.170 --> 02:16:55.516]  When Stephanopoulos says there's no evidence, he gets the evidence thrown right in his face, and they're starting to look like fools.
[02:16:56.072 --> 02:17:11.244]  They're getting into the Baghdad-Bab area, where everybody in the world is seeing American tanks rolling into Baghdad, but there at the Saddam Hussein Palace, they're saying there's no tanks in Baghdad.
[02:17:12.264 --> 02:17:16.067]  The whole world can see the fraud, and it's not a small fraud.
[02:17:16.888 --> 02:17:19.370]  This is the full spectrum fraud.
[02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:23.293]  It's dead voter ballots, it's out-of-state voters,
[02:17:23.837 --> 02:17:32.120]  You know, it's people tearing up Trump votes or just, you know, putting another vote on it to cancel it as an overvote.
[02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:33.961]  These are the easiest things in the world.
[02:17:34.621 --> 02:17:39.203]  All you have to do to prove fraud is not allow the observers in.
[02:17:39.803 --> 02:17:45.745]  It's not the case that you have to prove that something bad happened with the ballot in the counting room.
[02:17:46.892 --> 02:17:57.156]  If you don't allow observers in, which is the law, then every ballot counted during the time when the observers were disallowed is a bad ballot.
[02:17:57.396 --> 02:17:58.436]  A bad ballot.
[02:17:58.536 --> 02:18:00.157]  And this is going to be thrown out.
[02:18:00.677 --> 02:18:02.858]  There's no question these are going to be thrown out.
[02:18:03.298 --> 02:18:07.699]  And it's not even a question necessarily of the Supreme Court of the United States.
[02:18:10.031 --> 02:18:19.613]  The Trump legal team with, you know, really superstars like Rudy Giuliani, who put mafia bosses and Wall Street billionaires in prison.
[02:18:19.693 --> 02:18:21.633]  He's not a piker at this.
[02:18:22.514 --> 02:18:31.495]  You know, Harmeet Dhillon, Sidney Powell, they've got a real brain trust and they have assembled the real computer forensic experts.
[02:18:32.015 --> 02:18:33.596]  So they're not going to get away with this.
[02:18:34.356 --> 02:18:39.357]  And when I said it doesn't necessarily even, you know, become a Supreme Court decision,
[02:18:40.299 --> 02:18:45.401]  If there is no concession by Trump, everybody should be hearing this by now.
[02:18:46.122 --> 02:18:51.404]  If there's no concession by Trump, then it continues to play out in the courts.
[02:18:52.144 --> 02:19:07.131]  If it goes into December when the electoral college is supposed to meet, if there's no concession and there's no certification of these states that are being contested, then it goes to the state legislatures
[02:19:08.905 --> 02:19:10.606]  To put forth the electors.
[02:19:11.566 --> 02:19:21.852]  The number of electors for each state is determined in the Constitution, but the fact that it's the legislature that chooses them is right in black and white.
[02:19:22.512 --> 02:19:32.497]  Article 2, Section 1, it says, second paragraph, each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct
[02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:38.862]  A number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives, etc.
[02:19:39.222 --> 02:19:43.624]  But it's the legislature that picks the electors.
[02:19:44.364 --> 02:20:00.050]  If the election results are not certified, meaning if it's still a contested election in these swing states, then it becomes a classic power battle where the Republican majority legislatures win.
[02:20:03.706 --> 02:20:19.753]  And in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, in Georgia, Wisconsin, and Arizona, but not Nevada, but in those five states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, the Republicans control the legislature.
[02:20:20.834 --> 02:20:28.397]  Now, if these states try to continue with the fraud and deny a revote, it just stays tied up in court.
[02:20:29.117 --> 02:20:29.838]  I saw today,
[02:20:31.356 --> 02:20:37.039]  The Secretary of State of Arizona is a woman named Katie Hobbs, H-O-B-B-S.
[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:40.001]  She is one of these Soros people.
[02:20:40.421 --> 02:20:41.942]  She was put there by Soros.
[02:20:41.982 --> 02:20:44.023]  This is part of their lawfare project.
[02:20:44.523 --> 02:20:53.768]  It's similar to putting in Soros DAs that will let the arsonists go in and out of the jail overnight and go back on the street.
[02:20:54.793 --> 02:20:57.695]  So Soros paid for these secretaries of states.
[02:20:57.775 --> 02:21:00.017]  It's usually a very nondescript position.
[02:21:00.057 --> 02:21:00.597]  Who wants it?
[02:21:00.637 --> 02:21:03.659]  It's a no big deal job, until there's an election.
[02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:17.348]  But the problem is, if there is no certification, and they can't certify it while it's in the courts, if there's no certification, then the legislature of Arizona has the trump card.
[02:21:17.929 --> 02:21:23.873]  They're not going to say, oh sure, let a Democrat Soros paid secretary of state
[02:21:25.167 --> 02:21:26.368]  Certify the election.
[02:21:26.448 --> 02:21:27.289]  We're good with that.
[02:21:27.669 --> 02:21:29.150]  We don't want to have any power.
[02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:31.372]  We want to be useless cucks.
[02:21:31.852 --> 02:21:41.860]  You know, we want to just admit to everyone in Arizona that we actually, even though we control the legislature, we're just going to roll over on our backs, put our legs in the air and surrender.
[02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:43.381]  Hell no, they won't.
[02:21:44.121 --> 02:21:50.506]  So if this stays in the courts, then the Republicans in these state legislatures win.
[02:21:51.447 --> 02:21:53.048]  Then they choose their own electors.
[02:21:54.107 --> 02:22:19.028]  You know, the reason I wrote Enemies Foreign and Domestic like 15 years ago now and the other books that I've written is so that when these things started to happen, I'd have a track record and people would listen to me because I thought that I had some insights into what was coming based on my previous life experiences and study of history.
[02:22:21.283 --> 02:22:23.825]  I would say that a lot of it is actually happening right now.
[02:22:24.105 --> 02:22:29.169]  So I thank Alex Jones for giving me this big microphone.
[02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:35.835]  This is why I wrote the books, so that I'd be a spokesperson, you know, have a voice when the time came.
[02:22:36.655 --> 02:22:38.677]  So I guess to that extent, it works.
[02:22:38.737 --> 02:22:40.718]  So thank you, InfoWars.
[02:22:40.759 --> 02:22:41.879]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:44.642]  You know, we're right now in
[02:22:45.737 --> 02:22:48.137]  A phase of this civil war, pre-kinetic.
[02:22:48.538 --> 02:22:55.959]  And maybe it won't go kinetic, but I kind of suspect that our country's too far gone for any kind of a smooth landing scenario.
[02:22:56.539 --> 02:23:02.840]  But we're in the psyops, the info war, the morale period.
[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:06.721]  This is when each side is trying to dispirit the other.
[02:23:07.601 --> 02:23:12.122]  But look at how strong we are, because we have faced down four years
[02:23:13.012 --> 02:23:19.174]  Of being called neo-Nazis, of being called white supremacist racists.
[02:23:20.034 --> 02:23:22.895]  You know, they call Trump, you know, Hitler.
[02:23:23.635 --> 02:23:27.777]  For four years we've put up with that and we didn't lose our spirit.
[02:23:28.317 --> 02:23:36.819]  We slogged on and we went to the polls and we won this election overwhelmingly, even in the swing states.
[02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:42.121]  And that's why we're going to win in the end because their fraud was so massive
[02:23:42.591 --> 02:23:44.853]  That they left massive evidence.
[02:23:45.514 --> 02:23:53.600]  And when they involve so many people in a giant fraud plan like this, they can't keep everybody's mouth shut.
[02:23:54.221 --> 02:24:07.072]  You know, we all know about the Postal Service whistleblowers and the great extent that the Postal Service investigators, who are anti-Trump Democrat partisans,
[02:24:07.984 --> 02:24:23.996]  We know about the mind control psyop they tried on that postal worker in Pennsylvania, going after him for hours and hours trying to get what they could consider a retraction out, which immediately went to the Washington Post, a false retraction.
[02:24:25.217 --> 02:24:36.586]  If you can imagine that kind of pressure being put on one postal clerk, a former Marine who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, you can imagine how worried they are.
[02:24:37.319 --> 02:24:44.043]  One of the postal inspector interrogators, who's also a, I understand, a polygrapher.
[02:24:44.383 --> 02:24:49.506]  So he's basically an interrogator, meaning a mind manipulator.
[02:24:49.706 --> 02:24:51.847]  That's what an interrogator is.
[02:24:51.867 --> 02:24:53.828]  A mind manipulator.
[02:24:54.609 --> 02:24:56.430]  You can imagine how worried they are.
[02:24:56.690 --> 02:25:00.332]  One of the things he said is, there's senators on this now.
[02:25:00.792 --> 02:25:02.673]  You know, this is getting out of control.
[02:25:02.733 --> 02:25:04.274]  We have to get it back in control.
[02:25:05.037 --> 02:25:12.560]  This is like the Dutch boy trying to put his finger in a dike when a tsunami is coming that's ten times as high as the dike.
[02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:25.265]  We've even heard the recordings from a couple weeks ago of a Democrat in Michigan teaching a seminar on vote fraud.
[02:25:25.885 --> 02:25:32.628]  Somebody even then had enough of a conscience and knew where this was going to make an audio recording of it.
[02:25:33.149 --> 02:25:36.211]  Explaining how to spoof the ballot machine.
[02:25:36.731 --> 02:25:46.036]  How to put a post-it note over the duplicate stamp so that they could count both ballots, the duplicate and the old one.
[02:25:46.456 --> 02:25:49.958]  You know, how they could run it through multiple times.
[02:25:50.018 --> 02:25:53.180]  How they can invalidate a Trump vote.
[02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:55.061]  This was recorded.
[02:25:56.022 --> 02:25:58.103]  Trump's legal team has all of this.
[02:25:58.623 --> 02:26:01.785]  They have hundreds of signed affidavit witnesses.
[02:26:02.574 --> 02:26:08.819]  People were in the Detroit counting room when the pallets of ballots were brought in.
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:11.481]  There are witnesses to all of this.
[02:26:12.282 --> 02:26:17.426]  So, on the Democrat side, there has to be a huge freakout going on right now.
[02:26:17.826 --> 02:26:19.007]  But we can't coast.
[02:26:19.067 --> 02:26:20.348]  We can't coast at all.
[02:26:20.909 --> 02:26:25.793]  Because I would expect at any moment, because this is from the playbook,
[02:26:26.519 --> 02:26:42.703]  When the script is going against them, when the narrative is not working, what the Communists, Bolsheviks, Leftists, Socialists, Democrats, whatever you want to call them this week, the Collectivists, they will try to flip to a new narrative.
[02:26:43.444 --> 02:26:48.805]  And a new narrative could very easily be something like a false flag operation.
[02:26:49.542 --> 02:26:59.051]  So be on your guard up in Washington, or if you're driving to Washington, it's very likely that there's going to be some kind of a false flag.
[02:26:59.471 --> 02:27:08.680]  You know, CBS News has out today, they'll be running it, a militia story, another militia story, right?
[02:27:09.681 --> 02:27:12.183]  Now they've had this thing for months.
[02:27:12.263 --> 02:27:14.385]  Some of it was recorded like a year ago.
[02:27:15.267 --> 02:27:19.511]  So they've had this militia story in the can for months.
[02:27:20.111 --> 02:27:22.013]  Why are they running it on November 12?
[02:27:23.694 --> 02:27:25.236]  Their evil militia story.
[02:27:25.356 --> 02:27:37.226]  And to anybody that wants to cooperate with the mainstream media, if you think that you're going to be able to come across as the reasoned and rational Second Amendment spokesman,
[02:27:38.001 --> 02:27:49.507]  Don't be a fool, because what they'll do is they'll also find some camo-wearing yahoos that will talk about shooting people in the face.
[02:27:50.868 --> 02:28:05.676]  And they will mix all of this footage, the rational, you know, well-reasoned Second Amendment spokesmen, they will mix that footage with the, you know, the Billy Bob, redneck, yahoo, shoot-em-in-the-face footage,
[02:28:06.494 --> 02:28:22.057]  And the intention is to make the entire militia movement and the Second Amendment movement look like a bunch of trigger-happy, hair-trigger maniacs that are just ready to start shooting liberals in the face.
[02:28:22.717 --> 02:28:36.100]  If you cooperate with the mainstream media making a production like this, because you're the well-reasoned, responsible, thinking things through, trying sincerely to explain it, you're very naive.
[02:28:36.846 --> 02:28:40.629]  I've seen this a dozen times over the past 30 years.
[02:28:40.849 --> 02:28:43.091]  I've been approached to participate in these things.
[02:28:43.892 --> 02:28:56.822]  And what they invariably will do is mix your really well-thought-out Second Amendment argument with assault rifle footage and idiots saying, shoot them in the face.
[02:28:58.547 --> 02:29:01.508]  Please don't be a sucker and go down that route, okay?
[02:29:01.888 --> 02:29:07.390]  So why did they release this documentary today when it's been ready for weeks or months?
[02:29:08.211 --> 02:29:09.711]  You think it's a coincidence?
[02:29:10.592 --> 02:29:13.092]  They're priming the pump for action.
[02:29:14.113 --> 02:29:25.297]  So if something happens up in Washington, it's very likely to be a false flag event that will be blamed on white, racist, Trump-loving militias.
[02:29:25.737 --> 02:29:27.798]  And this will be used as an excuse
[02:29:28.342 --> 02:29:35.288]  To slime the entire Trump nation and make it illegal to hold any more rallies.
[02:29:35.309 --> 02:29:38.031]  Because they've got to shut down the rallies.
[02:29:38.091 --> 02:29:45.358]  They're very worried about, you know, when Biden was holding his little baby rallies, more Trump people came out.
[02:29:45.971 --> 02:29:53.874]  Now they're worried that if Biden is inaugurated, more Trump people will come to the Biden inauguration than Biden supporters.
[02:29:54.375 --> 02:29:57.416]  So they've got to find a way to stop these rallies.
[02:29:57.516 --> 02:29:59.297]  The rallies show our strength.
[02:29:59.857 --> 02:30:03.958]  And a false flag operation is the way to stop the rallies.
[02:30:04.559 --> 02:30:09.361]  That's why CBS dropped their militia documentary today.
[02:30:09.521 --> 02:30:10.621]  Make no doubt about it.
[02:30:10.781 --> 02:30:12.502]  I'll continue on this on the other side.
[02:30:13.459 --> 02:30:28.406]  You know, the title of my first book is Enemies, Foreign and Domestic, and it comes from part of the oath that all military and law enforcement take, which is to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:30:28.486 --> 02:30:36.610]  And I'll have to tell you, in all honesty, foreign enemies are a lot easier to deal with than domestic enemies, by far.
[02:30:37.310 --> 02:30:43.153]  And if the Democrats get away with the biggest fraud, the biggest vote theft in history,
[02:30:44.235 --> 02:30:46.476]  Look at who's going to be right back in the saddle.
[02:30:47.797 --> 02:30:49.438]  John Brennan, the communist.
[02:30:50.398 --> 02:30:51.358]  James Comey.
[02:30:52.139 --> 02:30:56.081]  They're all going to be right back in power positions again.
[02:30:56.861 --> 02:31:05.365]  Already Obama's foreign policy team is right back in the coming White House if they get through with this fraud.
[02:31:06.186 --> 02:31:08.827]  We'll never hear another word about the Durham report.
[02:31:09.487 --> 02:31:11.128]  It'll go right down the memory hole.
[02:31:12.757 --> 02:31:17.580]  The deep state will be not only emboldened, they'll be fully in power.
[02:31:18.241 --> 02:31:25.746]  If they can cheat their way into the White House, what makes you think they can't cheat their way into getting the two Georgia Senate seats?
[02:31:26.707 --> 02:31:34.852]  If they get the Georgia Senate seats, then they pack the Supreme Court, they bring in Puerto Rico and D.C.
[02:31:34.932 --> 02:31:38.355]  as states and get four more senators right off the bat,
[02:31:38.979 --> 02:31:43.740]  Giving themselves a, you know, an impossible to defeat majority.
[02:31:45.021 --> 02:31:46.521]  Then they can go after guns.
[02:31:46.601 --> 02:31:53.103]  They can literally say any gun invented after 1799 when the Constitution was written is an illegal gun.
[02:31:53.123 --> 02:31:56.004]  Now that doesn't mean that they can enforce it.
[02:31:56.884 --> 02:31:58.865]  But this is where they're going to go.
[02:31:59.625 --> 02:32:02.326]  So by no means get ready to quit.
[02:32:03.166 --> 02:32:05.207]  In the last segment I mentioned that
[02:32:05.842 --> 02:32:13.384]  The time is ripe for a false flag operation because they desperately need to get this away from the fraud narrative.
[02:32:14.105 --> 02:32:18.026]  Their embargo on the fraud, you know, it began with, there's no fraud.
[02:32:18.046 --> 02:32:21.227]  Then it was, there's no widespread fraud.
[02:32:22.207 --> 02:32:26.489]  Now it's, it's widespread, but it's not enough to flip the elections.
[02:32:27.249 --> 02:32:30.050]  But we've seen in several of these swing states,
[02:32:30.638 --> 02:32:41.865]  At least in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Michigan, you have these woman Secretary of States that all came in recently that are Soros plants.
[02:32:42.806 --> 02:32:49.170]  The one in Arizona said that Trump supporters are neo-Nazis.
[02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:51.892]  Now she's saying we don't need no recount.
[02:32:52.472 --> 02:32:54.774]  You know, a recount will just, you know,
[02:32:55.533 --> 02:32:57.534]  Increase the conspiracy theories.
[02:32:57.594 --> 02:33:01.136]  So, you know, pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.
[02:33:02.077 --> 02:33:03.798]  The media is all powerful.
[02:33:04.218 --> 02:33:05.799]  Just go with the narrative.
[02:33:06.159 --> 02:33:07.000]  Well, they can't.
[02:33:07.420 --> 02:33:09.601]  The fraud narrative is like a tsunami.
[02:33:09.963 --> 02:33:13.745]  So they're going to have to switch it to a bigger, a better story.
[02:33:14.265 --> 02:33:25.469]  And nothing would work better than around this time, like a white, quote unquote, neo-Nazi racist, you know, white supremacist mass shooting, something like that.
[02:33:25.870 --> 02:33:33.733]  This is why the deep state mole plants inside of the DOJ and the DHS, they come out with a ridiculous
[02:33:34.213 --> 02:33:45.628]  Garbage about the biggest terror threat are those, you know, those wily white racists because they're preparing the psychological battle space for a false flag.
[02:33:46.335 --> 02:33:49.436]  I'm not saying don't go to Washington.
[02:33:49.957 --> 02:33:51.757]  By all means, go to Washington.
[02:33:52.178 --> 02:34:02.462]  The reason I mention a false flag risk is by talking about it in advance as a deep state tool, you take power away from it.
[02:34:02.862 --> 02:34:04.803]  You take the shock value away from it.
[02:34:04.863 --> 02:34:11.586]  Because if it happens, half of the country will immediately say, oh boy, we saw that coming a mile away.
[02:34:12.216 --> 02:34:14.958]  You know, false flag operation, no doubt.
[02:34:15.078 --> 02:34:21.844]  And that takes the power and sting away from it by knowing about, knowing the likelihood of it in advance.
[02:34:22.424 --> 02:34:24.306]  So, yes, by all means go.
[02:34:24.966 --> 02:34:26.688]  And not only go, keep going.
[02:34:26.788 --> 02:34:28.389]  And keep doing capital rallies.
[02:34:28.529 --> 02:34:36.916]  Rallies anywhere to disrupt the mainstream media, the false narrative that there's no fraud.
[02:34:37.611 --> 02:34:50.595]  Put these rallies in front of their faces, talking about stopping the steal, so that local media has to go on and say, look at these thousands and millions of people that believe this conspiracy theory.
[02:34:50.635 --> 02:34:51.915]  They must all be nuts.
[02:34:52.496 --> 02:34:56.797]  When the mainstream media says that, more and more people are changing the channel.
[02:34:57.335 --> 02:35:05.938]  You know, television viewers are leaving Fox, for example, conservatives, going to One America News and Newsmax, and obviously to InfoWars.
[02:35:06.358 --> 02:35:08.939]  But at every level, you can keep this up.
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:19.884]  And one of the ideas that I've seen that I'd like to share is a simple message, which is Trump won, okay?
[02:35:20.024 --> 02:35:24.465]  I took one of my Trump-Pence magnet bumper stickers, okay?
[02:35:26.969 --> 02:35:30.851]  I just used, where it said 2020, I just used tape and put one.
[02:35:31.731 --> 02:35:32.812]  Stick it back on the car.
[02:35:33.572 --> 02:35:35.013]  Same thing with the yard sign.
[02:35:36.593 --> 02:35:40.395]  If you, and this is what anybody says, what do you mean Trump won?
[02:35:41.415 --> 02:35:49.199]  If you come out of the bank with $100 and a thief pickpockets you and steals it, it's your money.
[02:35:49.219 --> 02:35:52.520]  The thief is a thief, okay?
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:54.001]  The thief didn't win the money.
[02:35:54.605 --> 02:35:59.671]  You know, if you win a lottery prize and the thief steals it, you still are the winner.
[02:36:00.572 --> 02:36:02.474]  You were robbed by a thief.
[02:36:02.834 --> 02:36:04.476]  And that's what the Democrats have done.
[02:36:04.496 --> 02:36:06.879]  So yes, Trump won.
[02:36:07.631 --> 02:36:08.791]  It's a great message.
[02:36:08.851 --> 02:36:09.652]  It's positive.
[02:36:09.992 --> 02:36:14.374]  It's not calling the Democrats evil jerks, which a lot of them are.
[02:36:14.754 --> 02:36:25.378]  But you don't want to alienate every wavering, soon-to-be-red-pilled, lifelong Democrat by calling them all thieves and creeps.
[02:36:26.098 --> 02:36:28.119]  Just say, Trump won.
[02:36:28.759 --> 02:36:29.499]  And it's easy.
[02:36:29.559 --> 02:36:31.800]  It takes five minutes with a little bit of tape.
[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:32.801]  I didn't have blue tape.
[02:36:32.861 --> 02:36:33.921]  I had black and white tape.
[02:36:33.941 --> 02:36:35.462]  But it still looks fine from 50 feet away.
[02:36:37.202 --> 02:36:40.245]  But that's a message that you can keep up.
[02:36:40.525 --> 02:36:41.626]  Trump won.
[02:36:41.806 --> 02:36:43.207]  Put that in people's faces.
[02:36:43.828 --> 02:36:48.372]  Don't let, even at the street level, even driving around or yard sign level,
[02:36:49.235 --> 02:36:53.737]  Don't let the Biden people feel like they've got it in the bag.
[02:36:54.137 --> 02:36:58.658]  We're in that psychological warfare section of this transition of power.
[02:36:58.879 --> 02:37:00.659]  Hopefully there's no transition of power.
[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:11.003]  I salute Mike Pompeo because at a press conference when he was asked about the transition to the Biden administration,
[02:37:12.062 --> 02:37:16.604]  He just absolutely laid the big red pill.
[02:37:17.104 --> 02:37:25.187]  I mean, he laid the big troll red pill right on the mainstream media and said, I anticipate a smooth transition to the second Trump administration.
[02:37:25.607 --> 02:37:27.408]  You can almost see heads exploding.
[02:37:28.268 --> 02:37:29.709]  So this is what we have to do.
[02:37:30.189 --> 02:37:32.370]  Keep the message Trump won.
[02:37:33.150 --> 02:37:34.670]  Biden is a fake.
[02:37:34.730 --> 02:37:35.731]  He's a usurper.
[02:37:35.751 --> 02:37:38.292]  He's just in there by fraud.
[02:37:38.792 --> 02:37:41.493]  The same mainstream media and big tech
[02:37:42.068 --> 02:37:56.561]  You know, that told us for four years he was a Russian spy, then he was a Ukrainian sellout, then he murdered 200,000 people with COVID, and then they said that Biden was going to win by 15 points.
[02:37:56.981 --> 02:38:02.266]  These same lying SOBs are now telling us that there's no fraud.
[02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:06.593]  So we just laugh in their faces and just bulldoze ahead.
[02:38:07.134 --> 02:38:08.335]  We're not going to stop.
[02:38:08.895 --> 02:38:19.584]  You know, there's a saying, it's attributed variously to different people, it probably goes back to the Greeks and Romans, who knows, but it says, quantity has a quality all of its own.
[02:38:20.365 --> 02:38:25.209]  These mass rallies are something that the Democrats can't do.
[02:38:26.013 --> 02:38:30.856]  You know, because they control media and tech, they can dial the volume up.
[02:38:30.916 --> 02:38:43.684]  They can make a little tiny Biden Jeep rally, you know, look like a grand production with the fireworks and the big screen jumbotron of Biden's senile face.
[02:38:44.224 --> 02:38:51.629]  But what they can't do is duplicate what it looks like when 20,000 or 50,000 people come out to support Trump.
[02:38:52.372 --> 02:38:53.352]  That they can't do.
[02:38:53.932 --> 02:39:09.236]  So maintaining at every level, from yard sign, from bumper sticker, to these Trump truck caravans, to the mass rallies in Washington, this is our strength.
[02:39:09.836 --> 02:39:11.077]  This is what we can do.
[02:39:11.837 --> 02:39:15.718]  And just be aware that in their desperation,
[02:39:16.556 --> 02:39:24.221]  These Democrats, many of whom are fearing that they'll go to prison, people like Brennan and Clapper and Comey could do prison time.
[02:39:25.242 --> 02:39:32.427]  If Trump has a second term, the deep state is going to be like a vampire with a stake through its heart.
[02:39:33.227 --> 02:39:34.648]  They're not going to let it happen.
[02:39:34.728 --> 02:39:36.769]  They will do anything to prevent it.
[02:39:38.811 --> 02:39:42.933]  When you buy my books on Kindle or Audible, that's great.
[02:39:45.206 --> 02:39:46.026]  They can be deleted.
[02:39:46.086 --> 02:39:51.429]  If Biden's elected, I expect, you know, there'll be gulags in our future.
[02:39:52.849 --> 02:39:56.251]  Fortunately, I don't live in a commie blue state.
[02:39:56.891 --> 02:40:00.032]  They're going to have their work cut out if they want to get me down here.
[02:40:00.653 --> 02:40:04.995]  Maybe they can do some kind of a snatch, but it's not going to be widespread stuff.
[02:40:05.055 --> 02:40:09.637]  They might try the Roger Stone method, but, you know, they better be loaded per bear.
[02:40:09.677 --> 02:40:10.557]  That's all I can say.
[02:40:11.431 --> 02:40:38.640]  Now, one of the new false narratives that the Marxist media is promoting, because they need something to fill the time so that they don't have to talk about the worst electoral fraud in American history, you know, fraud that is at Ukraine level, at Kenya level, worse, is that Trump is purging the military because he wants to use the military
[02:40:39.252 --> 02:40:51.621]  In sort of like a reverse preventative coup to avoid leaving by not recognizing the rightful president, which they say will be Joe Biden.
[02:40:52.341 --> 02:40:53.342]  Fraud or no fraud.
[02:40:53.862 --> 02:40:57.825]  We just keep pushing the fraud story, play it through the court.
[02:40:58.726 --> 02:41:06.111]  It goes to the state legislatures who will determine the electors.
[02:41:06.581 --> 02:41:09.303]  This has happened several times before in American history.
[02:41:09.603 --> 02:41:10.484]  It's not unheard of.
[02:41:11.004 --> 02:41:12.545]  It's part of the Constitution.
[02:41:13.526 --> 02:41:25.175]  Even communists like Van Jones, who has been in the Obama administration, and I think he's a CNN contributor, Van Jones made a very slick video a couple days ago.
[02:41:25.875 --> 02:41:27.517]  It's one of these TED Talks.
[02:41:27.617 --> 02:41:33.361]  It's like a Soros think tank that he's talking about
[02:41:34.142 --> 02:41:39.105]  Everybody needs to know that we don't just automatically win.
[02:41:39.125 --> 02:41:43.988]  If Trump doesn't concede, it goes to these state legislatures.
[02:41:44.048 --> 02:41:52.294]  He's preparing his side's battle space for the shock that Trump might actually use the Constitution and win.
[02:41:52.314 --> 02:42:00.339]  And he's dropping big hints that in this case, it's time to go full war, all out full war.
[02:42:03.857 --> 02:42:14.202]  Pondering how a civil war unfolds, there's sort of an idea or a concept of you want the other side to fire first.
[02:42:15.102 --> 02:42:22.145]  You want to, as long as possible, stay within the boundaries of the constitutional law.
[02:42:22.885 --> 02:42:24.046]  Play it through the courts.
[02:42:24.846 --> 02:42:33.170]  When the courts are still deadlocked, if the Supreme Court is indeterminate, then each of these states, legislatures,
[02:42:33.669 --> 02:42:48.737]  We'll put forward their own slate of electors because they will recognize that they were had by their George Soros-funded secretaries of state, and in some cases governors, that promoted the fraud.
[02:42:49.417 --> 02:42:52.279]  They will put forward pro-Trump electors.
[02:42:52.879 --> 02:43:02.044]  At this point, the Antifa, BLM, Rev Com side is going to absolutely lose its collective mind.
[02:43:02.873 --> 02:43:15.355]  They will conduct riots and other, you know, forms of social sabotage, you know, blocking bridges, things like that, at a level that we have not seen in all of the George Floyd riots.
[02:43:16.415 --> 02:43:20.416]  But this isn't all bad because it will flush them out into the open.
[02:43:20.976 --> 02:43:27.017]  What they don't understand is that Trump Nation has been paying close attention.
[02:43:27.617 --> 02:43:32.178]  Now, while they've been the, you know, the wild black bloc radicals,
[02:43:33.197 --> 02:43:36.720]  We've been loading magazines and zeroing rifles.
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:50.809]  So it's going to be maybe not the exact outcome that they expect when they start doing things like blocking bridges, you know, setting trucks on fire on top of key bridges all across cities at the same time.
[02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:54.812]  This is a type of a predictable sabotage.
[02:43:55.553 --> 02:44:02.938]  Or doing things to railroad tracks that are so stupidly easy that, you know, kindergartners could do it.
[02:44:04.465 --> 02:44:11.288]  If they do this, they're going to be flushing themselves out in the open as the aggressors, as the ones that went violent.
[02:44:11.908 --> 02:44:19.352]  And then maybe we can look forward to a severe shortage of Marxist professors, you know, in the near future.
[02:44:20.012 --> 02:44:22.594]  But it's going to be a rocky period, there's no doubt.
[02:44:23.074 --> 02:44:28.697]  Because if Trump shows the fraud, pushes through the fraud,
[02:44:30.216 --> 02:44:36.639]  You know, push it out to the country so that everybody is clear that this election was stolen by a massive crime.
[02:44:37.319 --> 02:44:39.660]  You know, look at the crimes that have been done against him.
[02:44:40.181 --> 02:44:48.985]  I think it's Sidney Powell or maybe it's Harmeet Dhillon that says this is like a coup 4.0 or 5.0.
[02:44:49.185 --> 02:44:53.767]  You know, starting with the fake Russiagate, dirty dossier coup.
[02:44:54.187 --> 02:44:56.368]  They've never quit going after Trump.
[02:44:56.929 --> 02:44:59.430]  If Trump prevails after all of this,
[02:45:00.237 --> 02:45:07.202]  After Antifa and BLM are flushed out into the open as terrorists and criminals that we can deal with them harshly.
[02:45:08.242 --> 02:45:15.928]  If Trump is installed for a second term, then the deep state is in deep trouble and they know it.
[02:45:16.368 --> 02:45:20.010]  That's why they're going so all out crazy right now.
[02:45:20.911 --> 02:45:27.876]  And even within the, you would assume that the military is just going to, going to be loyal to the commander in chief and obey orders.
[02:45:28.076 --> 02:45:29.757]  No, this is not true.
[02:45:31.887 --> 02:45:36.810]  At the flag rank level, generals and admirals, they are picked by the Senate.
[02:45:37.330 --> 02:45:41.733]  And the Senate of the Democrats, they pick social justice warriors.
[02:45:42.433 --> 02:45:58.443]  And as we've seen, one of the reasons for making these radical social pushes into the military, forcing things like transsexuals in uniform onto the military, is because
[02:45:59.215 --> 02:46:02.876]  Traditional heritage American generals and admirals to resign.
[02:46:02.896 --> 02:46:07.958]  The ones that are left don't care about anything except their own power.
[02:46:08.998 --> 02:46:26.563]  I know from people that have been in the room that General Milley, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was put there because he is a deep state anti-Trumper, is somebody who, out of the earshot of President Trump, went in another building
[02:46:27.831 --> 02:46:42.237]  is a complete never-Trumper who is insubordinate and insulting to the Commander-in-Chief, intentionally setting a standard of no punishment for insubordination towards Trump.
[02:46:43.258 --> 02:46:48.600]  And this is a way of demonstrating to the other generals how powerless Trump really is.
[02:46:48.980 --> 02:46:50.101]  Could Trump fire him?
[02:46:50.888 --> 02:46:52.249]  Just like he fired Esper?
[02:46:52.589 --> 02:46:58.314]  Yes, but you have to be, you know, mindful of how this narrative will play out during this critical time.
[02:46:58.974 --> 02:47:02.377]  So, if Trump makes it through, will Milley be around?
[02:47:02.697 --> 02:47:04.559]  Heck no, Milley will be toast.
[02:47:05.199 --> 02:47:06.240]  He will be toast.
[02:47:06.300 --> 02:47:17.269]  He will join John Brennan and James Comey and McCabe and Clapper with the rest of the disloyal insubordinate snakes, the deep state snakes.
[02:47:17.947 --> 02:47:23.390]  You know, Esper is a guy who came from the corporate world where he was raking in the millions.
[02:47:23.730 --> 02:47:27.211]  Classic example of the Pentagon revolving door.
[02:47:27.772 --> 02:47:38.737]  You make millions in the military by shuffling programs to corporations that will then pay you back with a board seat or a do-nothing job.
[02:47:39.657 --> 02:47:44.660]  Then you might come back into government, you know, as a Secretary of Defense.
[02:47:45.535 --> 02:47:50.019]  Then after that, you go right back to a think tank or to the corporate world.
[02:47:50.379 --> 02:47:58.345]  Whatever will do the most damage to loyal patriotic Americans and do the most good for the globalist deep state.
[02:47:59.126 --> 02:48:00.827]  And that's what Trump is doing.
[02:48:00.867 --> 02:48:03.289]  He is flushing these snakes out.
[02:48:03.609 --> 02:48:04.410]  He's like St.
[02:48:04.490 --> 02:48:05.811]  Patrick in Ireland.
[02:48:06.231 --> 02:48:08.192]  This is why they hate him so much.
[02:48:08.973 --> 02:48:15.298]  He is pouring the defumigation gas into these snake holes and they can't stand it.
[02:48:15.922 --> 02:48:20.567]  They have all their chips pushed all in on Biden and the fraud.
[02:48:21.207 --> 02:48:22.168]  Now they're stuck.
[02:48:22.609 --> 02:48:25.112]  It's like the Titanic after hitting the iceberg.
[02:48:25.612 --> 02:48:28.815]  The lights are still on this big election fraud.
[02:48:29.456 --> 02:48:31.198]  And they're saying there's no leak.
[02:48:31.858 --> 02:48:33.380]  Everything on the ship is good.
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:35.102]  We'll be getting underway in a minute.
[02:48:35.542 --> 02:48:39.106]  But smart people know the fraud ship is sinking.
[02:48:39.716 --> 02:48:53.143]  And all of these deep state snakes and disloyal insubordinate traders who are loyal to their globalist corporate masters, they are going to go down with this fraud show.
[02:48:54.084 --> 02:49:04.069]  They might be pretty smart, wily operators to rise through the ranks in the military, get these millionaire, cushy corporate jobs, think tank jobs,
[02:49:04.727 --> 02:49:10.608]  But what they are not smart enough to realize is that the people running the fraud are not smart at all.
[02:49:11.228 --> 02:49:13.529]  They're leaving clues everywhere.
[02:49:14.209 --> 02:49:17.429]  Clues that are going to be laid out for the American public.
[02:49:18.109 --> 02:49:23.950]  And as this goes on, all I can say is our side has to keep up the pressure.
[02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:26.811]  That's why the Saturday rally is important.
[02:49:27.191 --> 02:49:31.812]  That's why, you know, local rallies and Trump caravans are important.
[02:49:32.212 --> 02:49:33.432]  And even this message.
[02:49:34.039 --> 02:49:36.401]  This message needs to stay.
[02:49:36.922 --> 02:49:38.203]  Trump won.
[02:49:38.903 --> 02:49:45.008]  Just because a thief steals your prize doesn't mean he's the prize winner.
[02:49:45.549 --> 02:49:46.950]  He's just a thief.
[02:49:47.671 --> 02:49:48.051]  All right?
[02:49:48.651 --> 02:49:50.573]  Anyway, that's it for this week.
[02:49:50.733 --> 02:49:53.696]  And, boy, every week we just don't know what's going to happen.
[02:49:54.076 --> 02:49:58.960]  But good luck to everybody up in Washington and everybody heading to Washington.
[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:01.182]  And we'll see you on the other side.
[02:50:12.847 --> 02:50:16.769]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[02:50:17.330 --> 02:50:23.293]  Bio-True Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity in the cells in the body.
[02:50:23.493 --> 02:50:24.734]  That's every human activity.
[02:50:25.314 --> 02:50:29.396]  And on top of it, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Humanoid.
[02:50:30.897 --> 02:50:31.478]  We're good to go.
[02:50:51.792 --> 02:50:52.333]  That's right.
[02:51:22.801 --> 02:51:24.402]  James in FEMA Region 1.
[02:51:24.443 --> 02:51:24.943]  You're on the air.
[02:51:24.983 --> 02:51:25.303]  Go ahead.
[02:51:25.383 --> 02:51:26.524]  Hey, God bless you, brother.
[02:51:26.544 --> 02:51:27.024]  How you doing?
[02:51:27.084 --> 02:51:29.746]  Man, you can cut the suspense with a knife, brother.
[02:51:29.907 --> 02:51:30.707]  Right on, man.
[02:51:30.747 --> 02:51:32.248]  Hey, first of all, product plug.
[02:51:32.288 --> 02:51:35.070]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion basically turned my life around, man.
[02:51:35.110 --> 02:51:36.491]  I've never felt better in my life.
[02:51:36.912 --> 02:51:37.092]  I'm 50.
[02:51:37.152 --> 02:51:37.432]  I feel 30.
[02:51:37.912 --> 02:51:38.633]  So kudos to you.
[02:51:38.673 --> 02:51:40.214]  I hope you keep cranking that product out.
[02:51:40.234 --> 02:51:42.616]  Tell us what Vitamin Mineral Fusion did for you, James.
[02:51:42.776 --> 02:51:44.437]  Well, you know, like I said, I'm 50 years old.
[02:51:44.497 --> 02:51:46.139]  I'm a single dad of two teen boys.
[02:51:46.219 --> 02:51:47.620]  And just life just drags you down.
[02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:50.202]  No energy, you know, just feeling lethargic all the time.
[02:51:50.242 --> 02:51:53.724]  And I tried over-the-counter or, you know, CVS type of vitamins.
[02:51:53.864 --> 02:51:54.985]  I didn't do anything.
[02:51:55.486 --> 02:51:58.648]  I, you know, started watching your show and decided I'd try it out.
[02:51:58.868 --> 02:52:01.830]  And man, I tell you what, I just feel so invigorated.
[02:52:01.850 --> 02:52:03.091]  You know, just lots of energy.
[02:52:03.151 --> 02:52:04.052]  I'm sleeping well.
[02:52:04.332 --> 02:52:05.573]  I don't get sick ever.
[02:52:05.633 --> 02:52:07.154]  Just an amazing, amazing product.
[02:52:07.215 --> 02:52:07.875]  I truly love it.
[02:52:07.895 --> 02:52:19.581]  Well, just so you know, we go to top nutritionists, top doctors, top scientists, top firms that are the best known, and we say, what is the best vitamin, mineral, amino acid thing for us to take and for us to sell to our audience?
[02:52:19.661 --> 02:52:21.722]  And it has a big cost in product for us.
[02:52:21.762 --> 02:52:24.044]  So again, the synthetic vitamins, the other stuff, they do nothing.
[02:52:24.064 --> 02:52:24.944]  That's what gives them a bad name.
[02:52:25.064 --> 02:52:26.525]  Good ones do incredible things.
[02:52:26.605 --> 02:52:28.946]  It's got the zinc, the vitamin D3, it's got everything in it.
[02:52:29.066 --> 02:52:30.387]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:52:30.467 --> 02:52:31.607]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:52:31.788 --> 02:52:32.248]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:42.315 --> 02:52:47.563]  DNA Force Plus, if you did one thing for your immune system, it would be get all the essential things.
[02:52:47.763 --> 02:52:49.966]  And that's the clean iodine, X2 or X3.
[02:52:50.106 --> 02:52:51.608]  That's the biotrichoselenium.
[02:52:51.729 --> 02:52:53.211]  That is the vitamin D3.
[02:52:53.251 --> 02:52:55.093]  That is the C. That is the zinc.
[02:52:55.134 --> 02:52:57.297]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential without them you die.
[02:52:57.357 --> 02:52:58.819]  And studies show you really need the other ones too.
[02:52:58.919 --> 02:53:00.300]  But DNA Force goes beyond that.
[02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:11.788]  It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10, the highest quality sources, with other ingredients that clean out the cells, that unclog them so all that stuff can get in.
[02:53:11.968 --> 02:53:12.988]  Viruses don't get in.
[02:53:13.028 --> 02:53:13.969]  The good stuff gets in.
[02:53:14.049 --> 02:53:18.132]  As the NIH website says, that if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate like they could.
[02:53:18.172 --> 02:53:20.754]  But I do this because it's essential, like oxygen, like water.
[02:53:28.919 --> 02:53:29.840]  That's gonna have to end in a week.
[02:53:29.860 --> 02:53:30.881]  We've got a limited supply.
[02:53:30.901 --> 02:53:32.623]  It was very hard to get the PQQ this time.
[02:53:32.703 --> 02:53:34.204]  A lot of our stuff is can't get anymore.
[02:53:34.224 --> 02:53:36.246]  A lot of our products because the supply chain is broken down.
[02:53:36.266 --> 02:53:37.227]  That's part of the Global's plan.
