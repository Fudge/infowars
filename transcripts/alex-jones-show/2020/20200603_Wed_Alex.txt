[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.231]  The social contract is being broken.
[00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:04.373]  It's beyond cloward and piven.
[00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:14.621]  The multinational corporations, I love the Communist China, the EU and Hollywood are on record saying that they are going to break America and fully enslave it and then use us to enforce world government.
[00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:25.050]  And now they're funding the next phase of the destabilization to make the president look weak and to say that he is the cause of the ongoing insurrection.
[00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:30.765]  Before forcing him from office one way or another.
[00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:36.850]  And we see all the signs unfolding right now that this is the big one.
[00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:42.715]  Only exposure of the deep state and support of the president is going to turn this around.
[00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:48.259]  And we are facing an embedded deep state coup of multinational traders.
[00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:55.886]  Who know they're going to end up going to prison down the road if they don't overthrow Trump and then put a dictatorship in place.
[00:00:57.523 --> 00:01:02.107]  Using the permanent race war as the cover.
[00:01:02.507 --> 00:01:08.031]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:14.016]  There's a definition that we all should revisit.
[00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:18.700]  It's called the social contract.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.542]  And it's being purposely broken.
[00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:26.426]  Civilization is going to be brought to its knees.
[00:01:28.072 --> 00:01:34.015]  And the anti-human era of the technocrats is now upon us.
[00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:39.957]  Submission to it only makes your life worse.
[00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:47.641]  And you're now witnessing all the major big tech companies take over
[00:01:50.188 --> 00:02:01.392]  The dashboards in your phones, in your laptops, in your desktops, and force information on you where you can't even have access to the content you've paid for.
[00:02:05.553 --> 00:02:07.534]  It was always designed for this.
[00:02:09.134 --> 00:02:16.536]  It was always a huge boa constrictor wrapping around us, hissing to us, telling us, don't struggle.
[00:02:17.377 --> 00:02:17.877]  And now,
[00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:28.581]  It's squeezing your bones and suffocating the economy and the culture and launching mass death and rupine.
[00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:37.946]  2002, we got secret documents from the IMF and World Bank that Greg Palast, the BBC, a real liberal, broke here on air.
[00:02:40.717 --> 00:02:54.907]  And in those documents it was how the IMF and World Bank funded leftist movements that were designed to create mass riots to then bring down economies so the IMF and World Bank could come in and take them over.
[00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:00.731]  And what the globalists have done to third world countries they're now doing to us.
[00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:05.815]  So I come and I give you the bad news that this is only going to escalate.
[00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:08.777]  But isn't that the good news to at least know
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.780]  And to understand it.
[00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:16.562]  That's why you've had the Pentagon come out against the President.
[00:03:18.023 --> 00:03:19.404]  Because they think he can be defeated.
[00:03:19.444 --> 00:03:20.944]  They're all thinking about their next job.
[00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:25.186]  And say, oh no, we don't want the Insurrection Act.
[00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:26.366]  We don't want troops on the street.
[00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:30.228]  And Trump's telling police chiefs, get in there!
[00:03:30.288 --> 00:03:31.048]  Stop these people!
[00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.679]  And they're like, nope, we're gonna take a knee and encourage it.
[00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:41.101]  Everyone I know either has been robbed, physically attacked, or knows someone very close that was.
[00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:45.302]  Most of the crew have had their mailboxes and cars and houses broken into.
[00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:51.884]  I'm carrying a gun all the time now, and I've told listeners, COVID-19 hysteria was a hoax.
[00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:58.926]  But the crime is off the charts, and I have told my family,
[00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:20.940]  And I told my son, because he's already moved out at 17 and a half, got a couple jobs, I said, you better not be out after 8 or 9 o'clock at night if you live in a place like Austin, Texas, because it is dangerous as hell, and you better be carrying a gun.
[00:04:22.568 --> 00:04:24.069]  It doesn't matter if you're black or you're white.
[00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.872]  Might be a black person hits you over the head, might be a white person hits you over the head.
[00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:33.076]  It is just rampant crime and physical attacks everywhere.
[00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:34.797]  It is bad.
[00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:43.763]  And even before they kicked all this off two weeks ago, I told you I was hiking around behind the neighborhood and I saw a guy trying to break in a house.
[00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.845]  Dressed in a burglar outfit.
[00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:48.226]  Head to toe.
[00:04:49.848 --> 00:04:51.389]  Wearing a black outfit, big white guy.
[00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.160]  It's just all over the place.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.401]  And I know people that own ATMs.
[00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:57.822]  They got broken into all over town.
[00:04:57.862 --> 00:04:58.943]  Gun shops got robbed.
[00:04:58.963 --> 00:04:59.783]  People are getting raped.
[00:04:59.823 --> 00:05:00.604]  People are getting killed.
[00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:03.906]  I've got so many videos of people getting shot and killed.
[00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:08.228]  But of course, you'll never hear it on the national news.
[00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.211]  You'll never see it on the big news aggregating sites because they don't count.
[00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:21.216]  Like retired police captain David Dorn running security at a major store.
[00:05:22.998 --> 00:05:25.178]  And they walked up and shot him dead in the chest.
[00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:26.799]  Oh, by the way, he's black.
[00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:29.159]  But you'll never hear about him because he's a cop.
[00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.539]  And the video is very sad, very powerful.
[00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:32.200]  We're going to play it here.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.980]  You can see the light go out of his eyes.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  He's in a pool of blood.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.461]  Said, hey, don't loot your own neighborhood.
[00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:39.161]  Boom!
[00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:40.421]  Right in the chest.
[00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:44.642]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:05:44.722 --> 00:05:46.582]  And there's just dead cops all over the country.
[00:05:46.602 --> 00:05:47.642]  But nobody knows their names.
[00:05:48.142 --> 00:05:49.142]  Nobody talks about them.
[00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.003]  Because it's not all part of this giant hype.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.500]  We're going to tell you what's coming next, folks.
[00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:58.441]  Trump's going to have to decapitate the deep state or we're going to lose.
[00:05:58.461 --> 00:05:59.201]  It's that simple.
[00:06:00.702 --> 00:06:17.846]  The Prince William Board of Supervisors in Virginia had Tom Special speaking there, a longtime Army veteran, combat Army intelligence, you name it, still in the reserves, and was assigned to different special forces groups.
[00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:22.666]  And he comes to us through some of the folks I know in the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:28.211]  He was there speaking about what's really going on here and the planned takedown of this country.
[00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:33.435]  And of course, the City Council cut him off because he wasn't a rioter or a looter.
[00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:37.239]  We're going to have him joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.103]  But listen to what he laid out, because this is exactly what we're facing.
[00:06:44.065 --> 00:06:45.687]  They are taking over the U.S.
[00:06:49.255 --> 00:06:49.415]  Okay.
[00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:49.656]  All right.
[00:06:49.856 --> 00:06:50.197]  That's fine.
[00:06:50.778 --> 00:06:51.779]  That's fine.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.682]  My name is Tom Speciale.
[00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:55.845]  I live here in Woodbridge.
[00:06:56.106 --> 00:06:57.027]  I have two children.
[00:06:57.067 --> 00:07:04.459]  Well, one still in school, if there was a school, if our country hadn't been shut down, and another one that would have graduated from high school.
[00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:05.500]  We're good to go.
[00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:37.886]  The government shutdown that has crippled our economy and a $3 trillion to maybe even $10 trillion debt that you've imposed.
[00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:43.208]  And when I say you, I mean Democrats have imposed on our country out of fear and terror.
[00:07:44.348 --> 00:07:47.149]  What I really want to talk about, though, is leadership.
[00:07:49.073 --> 00:07:52.715]  Go look at the 17 major inner cities in our country today.
[00:07:53.195 --> 00:08:06.903]  The ones that are rife with father, in particular, these destitute neighborhoods that have been abandoned by the Democratic Party, I believe, and have been sold a lot of lies about how they're going to be successful in the world with a bunch of government handouts.
[00:08:07.543 --> 00:08:10.266]  For 50 years, Democrats have been in charge of these neighborhoods.
[00:08:10.506 --> 00:08:12.168]  For 50 years.
[00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:18.195]  Those are the same people right now that are rioting in the streets, looting and burning our cities.
[00:08:18.215 --> 00:08:19.356]  Do you know why they're doing that?
[00:08:19.857 --> 00:08:21.358]  Because you've told them it's okay.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.582]  You have told them this is okay.
[00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:35.132]  But when 30,000 to 50,000 armed citizens went to Richmond to exercise their Second Amendment rights, before they were even there, they declared a state of emergency.
[00:08:35.732 --> 00:08:45.436]  But now, we've got people vandalizing monuments, burning churches, burning police stations, and then all of a sudden, holy ****, we've got to wake up and declare a state of emergency.
[00:08:46.547 --> 00:08:53.172]  The reason for this is the feckless, cowardly leadership of the Democrats in our country.
[00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.634]  They are responsible for this.
[00:08:55.654 --> 00:08:58.937]  Right now, I want you to think about something right now.
[00:08:58.957 --> 00:08:59.617]  I'm not finished.
[00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:01.759]  Right now, you need to think about something.
[00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:12.948]  The only reason that these people aren't going house to house and murdering, raping, and looting homes is because of an armed citizenry.
[00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:15.276]  That is a fact.
[00:09:15.676 --> 00:09:17.358]  Because that's what they want to do.
[00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:21.341]  And I'm not talking about the people, the actual peaceful protesters.
[00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:22.962]  I'm not talking about those.
[00:09:23.382 --> 00:09:30.268]  I'm talking about those people being taken advantage of by outside instigators that are trying to dismantle our country.
[00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.590]  And you are standing by and allowing it to happen.
[00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.012]  It's feckless and it's cowardly.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.481]  That is why it is happening.
[00:09:37.841 --> 00:09:44.706]  It is happening because you created this problem by building a dependency of the government into their lives.
[00:09:44.987 --> 00:09:51.591]  They are dependent for food, for housing, for education, and you have made them dependent for their own security and safety.
[00:09:53.013 --> 00:09:54.634]  Well, we're not going to be dependent!
[00:09:56.311 --> 00:10:03.173]  And right now, everybody is sitting at home, scared to death of a virus that didn't even exist.
[00:10:04.013 --> 00:10:07.433]  And now you've got people running through the streets, burning your loot.
[00:10:07.513 --> 00:10:08.874]  And you know what?
[00:10:08.954 --> 00:10:09.974]  I said I wasn't done yet.
[00:10:11.034 --> 00:10:15.275]  This is a problem that can be fixed if you will take leadership.
[00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:18.156]  But it's time to stop hiding.
[00:10:19.136 --> 00:10:20.536]  Is it possible?
[00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:22.177]  Is it possible to turn off his microphone?
[00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:23.577]  Sir, your time is up.
[00:10:23.597 --> 00:10:23.937]  You're done.
[00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:24.638]  It's been three minutes.
[00:10:24.718 --> 00:10:25.958]  This is... Please, please, please, please.
[00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:26.258]  Sir?
[00:10:42.154 --> 00:10:48.278]  He's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour, well familiar with the great work he does, and of course running for office as well for U.S.
[00:10:48.298 --> 00:10:48.578]  Senate.
[00:10:48.598 --> 00:10:53.381]  Now, I want to just say this here very crisply and very clearly for everybody.
[00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:55.002]  I wish we had more time.
[00:10:57.183 --> 00:10:58.404]  We told you this was all coming.
[00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:01.205]  We don't have more time.
[00:11:01.966 --> 00:11:02.946]  They're going to go for broke.
[00:11:03.407 --> 00:11:04.467]  The globalists aren't going to stop.
[00:11:05.028 --> 00:11:07.049]  They're just softening Trump up right now to kill him.
[00:11:09.349 --> 00:11:11.410]  And I'm seeing everybody back away from Trump in D.C.
[00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:11.811]  in fear.
[00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:13.912]  They're getting ready to make the main move.
[00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:23.138]  And I'm just going to say this to the people running that operation, and we know who they are, some of those retired generals, Hayden, Clapper, Obama, and others.
[00:11:23.758 --> 00:11:25.319]  You're never going to get away with this.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.741]  There may be a bunch of cowards up there in D.C.
[00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:32.424]  that all want to hedge their bets and are scared of you, but in the end,
[00:11:33.482 --> 00:11:37.265]  You and Bill Gates and all the rest of you are going to pay for what you've done.
[00:11:38.066 --> 00:11:51.477]  You've engineered this whole damn thing and you think just because big tech can spy on everybody and you've got everything wired up and we're under your control that you can bully this nation and run it in the ground and do all the horrible things you've engaged in.
[00:11:52.618 --> 00:11:53.338]  It's coming to an end.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:01.926]  You bombing us with fentanyl and your Hollywood crap trying to demoralize us and trying to totally break the social contract.
[00:12:02.796 --> 00:12:11.799]  And all your movies preparing everyone for civil war, the purges, and the Joker, and all the rest of the crap.
[00:12:12.739 --> 00:12:13.639]  You're the bad guys.
[00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:18.841]  You're the big mega-billionaire, trillion-dollar companies that are beyond cold-blooded.
[00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:32.597]  And you are literally trying to bring down civilization so you can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar and have a permanent, giant, poor class dumbed down and brainwashed by your media that you can control.
[00:12:32.897 --> 00:12:35.639]  You will not get away with it.
[00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:36.759]  You've been identified.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.043]  And I look at these sacks of garbage like Rosenstein and Fiona Hill and all of them when they testify to Congress.
[00:12:44.883 --> 00:12:47.785]  They crap their pants when they hear a backfire go off.
[00:12:48.612 --> 00:12:54.234]  But they sit there through the technocracy and the media and try to get the general public to burn things down and have us all kill each other.
[00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.135]  It's disgusting.
[00:12:55.995 --> 00:13:06.619]  But you cowards, when you bring down civilization, in your establishment officer class, are going to have to face the reality.
[00:13:10.601 --> 00:13:13.022]  You'll be just like Hitler in his bunker when we're done with you.
[00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:22.818]  There's an excellent World War II movie called Cross of Iron, but it's based on a composite of true stories when the Eastern Front was collapsing and the Russians were pouring into Germany.
[00:13:23.358 --> 00:13:31.685]  And there's this officer-class guy who's been going around engaging in all sorts of buffoonery and, you know, sophisticated garbage.
[00:13:32.622 --> 00:13:42.847]  And as they're being overrun, the sergeant throws the machine gun in his hands and starts laughing at him, because now he's really gonna get to fight and really get to act like the man he's been strutting around claiming he was.
[00:13:43.527 --> 00:13:48.730]  And so I'm just gonna tell all you New World Order people, you have conjured your destruction.
[00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.151]  It will not be America that goes down, it will be you.
[00:13:52.851 --> 00:13:58.174]  And we know who you are, and we know what you've done, and you are going to pay.
[00:13:58.414 --> 00:14:00.075]  Do you understand that?
[00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:03.653]  You are going down.
[00:14:04.033 --> 00:14:04.493]  Period.
[00:14:05.993 --> 00:14:07.854]  You'll never get away with this crap.
[00:14:08.654 --> 00:14:23.319]  You can hype up all your COVID garbage, and then hype up your race war garbage, and try to hype up the next thing to distract people, but more and more people know exactly who you are, and exactly what you're doing, and you're going to be blamed for everything that's happening.
[00:14:28.341 --> 00:14:29.041]  So, good luck.
[00:14:31.906 --> 00:14:34.247]  Now, I don't want to play all these videos, but I'm going to do it.
[00:14:35.367 --> 00:14:40.089]  Cops laid out, shot on the ground, like gulping for air, dying like fish out of water.
[00:14:40.729 --> 00:14:41.389]  And you're going to see it.
[00:14:41.409 --> 00:14:48.792]  And we're going to tell you their names too, because I saw the humanity in George Floyd and didn't like watch what was happening.
[00:14:51.153 --> 00:14:59.416]  But Twitter and Facebook are deleting videos of police captain David Dorn on the ground, like a fish out of water gulping for air.
[00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:01.517]  And then literally you see the light go out of his eyes.
[00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:19.729]  And that's what's really going on is just horrible, evil stuff everywhere, and the left is all endorsing it.
[00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:20.530]  So remember that.
[00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.691]  They're not just leftists that are idiots.
[00:15:23.392 --> 00:15:35.278]  All of these big tech heads, all of them, are literal authoritarian scum that premeditatedly did this and are mass murderers and deserve to be in super max prison solitary confinement.
[00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:37.540]  Let me just tell everybody something.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.521]  The party's over.
[00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.573]  You have to decide whether you want to be free or slave.
[00:15:43.593 --> 00:15:45.814]  You have to decide which side you're on.
[00:15:46.634 --> 00:15:51.857]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, on this June 3rd Wednesday transmission with 152 days out from the election.
[00:15:52.257 --> 00:15:55.538]  And they don't have any intent to let President Trump get up to that election point.
[00:15:56.419 --> 00:15:57.579]  They are going to discredit him.
[00:15:57.719 --> 00:15:59.060]  They're going to say that he can't rule.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.521]  They're going to say that he's caused the unrest that they've triggered.
[00:16:01.541 --> 00:16:05.883]  And they're going to call for his resignation or removal under the 25th Amendment.
[00:16:06.884 --> 00:16:08.084]  And that is coming next.
[00:16:08.704 --> 00:16:09.965]  You can set your watch by it.
[00:16:12.148 --> 00:16:28.132]  And the Atlantic Council, with people on it like General Jones and others, what Millie Weaver was saying yesterday is true, have public backdoors through private intelligence groups to the illegal backdoors that William Binning and others exposed inside the NSA.
[00:16:28.752 --> 00:16:35.613]  And so they're interfacing with big tech and the NSA to compromise the US government and engage in treason.
[00:16:37.934 --> 00:16:38.054]  And
[00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:44.373]  Brennan and Clapper are in command still with Obama of much of the government.
[00:16:45.094 --> 00:16:47.316]  The proper term to use is stay behind networks.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.081]  And they brag about this.
[00:16:53.142 --> 00:16:54.062]  They talk about this.
[00:16:54.243 --> 00:16:59.127]  And so, yeah, Trump came in naive about a lot of this.
[00:16:59.267 --> 00:17:01.489]  And now he's had them try to throw him out of office.
[00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.071]  And they're just getting more desperate.
[00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:04.793]  So they staged the whole COVID hoax.
[00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:22.007]  And now they've moved on to the race war and they're having police all over the country stand down and let people ram through buildings into Best Buys with forklifts and loot jewelry stores and kill people.
[00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:30.215]  And if a retired police officer is hired for security, they just shoot him dead in the chest and the media covers it up and goes further.
[00:17:32.199 --> 00:17:40.306]  It's all over the news that they're saying, oh, right-wingers are posing as Antifa, right-wingers are posing as looters.
[00:17:40.786 --> 00:17:49.854]  There's no looters, there's no Antifa, even though they're all out promoting it and pushing.
[00:17:49.874 --> 00:17:53.617]  Remember?
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.261]  The public is so dumbed down
[00:17:59.963 --> 00:18:07.006]  That when San Antonio News and National News and all of it said that Infowars burned down a homeless camp, 100% not true.
[00:18:07.727 --> 00:18:10.868]  My son got a whole bunch of calls saying he did it.
[00:18:11.469 --> 00:18:15.170]  People he knows said you did it.
[00:18:15.831 --> 00:18:18.172]  That's the hysteria of the mob psychology.
[00:18:19.673 --> 00:18:21.073]  And now that's the new thing I've done.
[00:18:21.173 --> 00:18:23.154]  See, oh, and I've got stacks of news here.
[00:18:23.354 --> 00:18:25.535]  Oh, the police are really staging all of it.
[00:18:25.555 --> 00:18:28.417]  And oh, they're the ones doing all of this.
[00:18:31.636 --> 00:18:34.457]  So that's how dangerous the situation is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:36.217 --> 00:18:40.698]  And I've got a stack of news here where they're blaming President Trump for everything.
[00:18:41.938 --> 00:18:44.499]  And they've got all their fake polls out again that, oh, he's at 38%.
[00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:46.339]  Oh, they may remove him.
[00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:49.660]  Oh, you know, even the Secretary of Defense disagrees with him now.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.001]  And you're seeing all the same cowardly behavior as they inch towards the exits, getting ready to make their move against the president.
[00:18:57.621 --> 00:19:00.602]  He's surrounded by Fauci and by all of them.
[00:19:03.203 --> 00:19:06.865]  Trump calls on police to get tough on the protesters.
[00:19:06.885 --> 00:19:07.665]  You mean the killers?
[00:19:08.185 --> 00:19:08.746]  The rioters?
[00:19:13.108 --> 00:19:13.868]  And let's go further.
[00:19:14.148 --> 00:19:16.409]  This is a CNBC article.
[00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:22.712]  Global experts go head-to-head over claims the coronavirus no longer exists clinically.
[00:19:22.732 --> 00:19:29.576]  That's because viruses mutate until they're no longer harmful.
[00:19:30.596 --> 00:19:31.376]  But it's worse than that.
[00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:32.337]  I'll explain coming up.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.381]  But that's the first phase of the lockdown.
[00:19:37.441 --> 00:19:39.142]  Now it's the martial law lockdown.
[00:19:42.384 --> 00:19:48.047]  As the economy's reserves run out, by the time we get up to the election, it is going to be war in the streets.
[00:19:49.368 --> 00:19:51.989]  And they don't want the war against the Democrats that shut the economy off.
[00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:53.090]  They want to make it about race.
[00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.431]  That's the quick bait and switch.
[00:19:58.633 --> 00:20:03.056]  Almost 150,000 raised overnight for black police captains shot dead by looters.
[00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:05.329]  In St.
[00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:17.576]  Louis, he was loved in the community, retired, 77, doing security at a major pawn shop, tried to stop folks stealing TVs, and they shot him right in the chest.
[00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:18.937]  And you can watch him in this video.
[00:20:19.237 --> 00:20:20.138]  And I want to humanize this.
[00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:22.439]  I don't like watching this, but you saw George Floyd die?
[00:20:22.459 --> 00:20:28.542]  Well, let's humanize this as you watch him breathing his last breaths as his blood pours out by the gallons.
[00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:31.004]  And you see his eyes gleam and then go dark.
[00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:32.349]  Here it is.
[00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:33.570]  Here he is dying on tape.
[00:20:33.851 --> 00:20:34.751]  Here he is murdered.
[00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:36.653]  Give us the audio, please.
[00:20:36.673 --> 00:20:36.913]  O.G.!
[00:20:37.954 --> 00:20:38.374]  O.G.!
[00:20:39.195 --> 00:20:40.896]  O.G., come on, stay with me, O.G.!
[00:20:41.297 --> 00:20:42.258]  O.G., stay with me!
[00:20:42.598 --> 00:20:43.539]  Stay with me, O.G.!
[00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:45.040]  Stay with me, O.G.!
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.121]  Come on, O.G.!
[00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:47.222]  Come on, O.G.!
[00:20:47.682 --> 00:20:48.763]  Come on, O.G., stay with me!
[00:20:49.303 --> 00:20:49.984]  Come on, O.G.!
[00:20:50.725 --> 00:20:51.405]  Come on, O.G.!
[00:20:51.785 --> 00:20:52.926]  Come on, O.G., stay with me!
[00:20:52.946 --> 00:20:53.647]  Come on, O.G.!
[00:20:54.288 --> 00:20:55.028]  Come on, O.G.!
[00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:56.389]  Come on, O.G.!
[00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:57.810]  Come on, O.G.!
[00:20:58.311 --> 00:21:00.473]  Damn, man, that was some TV's calls!
[00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:02.604]  Stop playing man!
[00:21:03.244 --> 00:21:03.824]  Come on OG!
[00:21:04.165 --> 00:21:04.565]  Come on OG!
[00:21:26.544 --> 00:21:29.446]  It's the breakdown of civilization right here.
[00:21:29.566 --> 00:21:37.450]  You might see this on Tucker Carlson, but you're not going to see it anywhere else, folks.
[00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.371]  The media will have a total shutdown of this.
[00:21:42.112 --> 00:21:44.734]  And the Silicon Valley folks that engineered all this, they love it.
[00:21:47.836 --> 00:21:48.657]  Yeah, he's dead.
[00:21:48.677 --> 00:21:50.358]  Alright, right there.
[00:21:50.398 --> 00:21:52.240]  Like a fish out of water.
[00:22:10.714 --> 00:22:12.195]  I think he do work here, man.
[00:22:12.735 --> 00:22:13.735]  He work here, man.
[00:22:14.575 --> 00:22:16.476]  I was some f****** TVs, man.
[00:22:17.316 --> 00:22:18.016]  I was some TV.
[00:22:18.056 --> 00:22:18.757]  He lost his life.
[00:22:18.777 --> 00:22:20.037]  I was some TVs, cuz.
[00:22:20.917 --> 00:22:22.618]  I was some TVs, cuz.
[00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:34.242]  And I have video after video of people being hit in the head, looted, killed, shot, stabbed, cops, black, white, old, young women, mainly white people getting attacked.
[00:22:35.492 --> 00:22:45.900]  And you won't see it anywhere on the national news and Twitter and Facebook and all of them take it down as fast as they can because Antifa is not violent and there's no looting going on.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.621]  There's no problems.
[00:22:47.001 --> 00:22:57.489]  Meanwhile, Brennan and Clapper run a criminal network through private intelligence agencies hooked into all the big tech, all the cameras, all your phones, everything.
[00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:58.931]  And they're so arrogant.
[00:22:59.724 --> 00:23:12.317]  They had every major device, Apple, Spotify, YouTube, Google, take over everybody's dashboards and force feed F the Police songs about killing the police from the 80s.
[00:23:14.319 --> 00:23:18.303]  That's big tech, that's the establishment, that's big tech that owns slave camps in China.
[00:23:21.152 --> 00:23:31.160]  They're force-feeding that this is legitimate and that this is a race war and that we must kneel at the police and the citizens before the looters to legitimize it.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:39.847]  And when the president says, this is wrong, we need to stop it, his own leadership comes out and criticizes him at press conferences, including the Secretary of Defense.
[00:23:40.067 --> 00:23:47.132]  They ought to fire his ass yesterday because they're all a bunch of cowardly scum that now surround our government.
[00:23:47.533 --> 00:23:49.875]  And they're getting ready to move the 25th Amendment against the president.
[00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:50.195]  Get ready.
[00:23:53.407 --> 00:23:55.409]  The social contract is being broken.
[00:23:56.409 --> 00:23:57.550]  It's beyond Cloward and Piven.
[00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:05.016]  The multinational corporations, I love the Communist China, the EU and Hollywood are on record saying that they are going to break America and fully enslave it.
[00:24:06.217 --> 00:24:07.798]  And then use us to enforce world government.
[00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:15.244]  And now they're funding the next phase of the destabilization to make the president look weak.
[00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:18.227]  They say that he is the cause of the ongoing insurrection.
[00:24:21.377 --> 00:24:23.918]  Before forcing him from office one way or another.
[00:24:25.798 --> 00:24:29.999]  And we see all the signs unfolding right now that this is the big one.
[00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:35.860]  Only exposure of the deep state and support of the president is going to turn this around.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:49.023]  And we are facing an embedded deep state coup of multinational traders who know they're going to end up going to prison down the road if they don't overthrow Trump and then put a dictatorship in place.
[00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:55.221]  Using the permanent race war as the cover.
[00:24:56.082 --> 00:24:57.443]  He'll be with us some of the next hour.
[00:24:57.803 --> 00:24:59.404]  Tom Special is a really smart guy.
[00:24:59.424 --> 00:25:00.485]  I've seen a lot of his videos.
[00:25:00.525 --> 00:25:02.486]  He's been on some of the M4 shows before.
[00:25:02.506 --> 00:25:04.447]  He's never been on the broadcast with us.
[00:25:04.487 --> 00:25:06.108]  He's got a long bio in U.S.
[00:25:06.128 --> 00:25:08.790]  Special Forces and intelligence and worked all over the world.
[00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.471]  He's running for Senate.
[00:25:10.511 --> 00:25:19.037]  We'll talk about that in a moment, but I got sent late last night a video of him at one of the big city councils in Virginia where the governor is refusing to send the National Guard.
[00:25:21.661 --> 00:25:25.184]  And I thought it was particularly powerful, but he didn't get a chance to lay out what he was about to say.
[00:25:25.224 --> 00:25:26.225]  So we'll do that first.
[00:25:28.286 --> 00:25:49.743]  And then we will get into General Flynn and how he was going to try to dig out this deep state that had these intelligence bridges out of private intelligence groups into the government and how they were able to have that parallel government there that's still running the CIA Operation Mockingbird programs and others that Trump still hasn't gotten control of.
[00:25:51.035 --> 00:25:56.478]  Because the people around Trump, other than maybe a few people like General Milley, are hedging bets.
[00:25:57.879 --> 00:26:01.681]  Because they want to just keep making $10 million a year or whatever and go play golf all day.
[00:26:02.782 --> 00:26:06.784]  This is total treachery and treason, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:07.044 --> 00:26:10.726]  And words don't describe the peril the country's in, the greatest in its history.
[00:26:10.947 --> 00:26:14.088]  But we'll get somebody who's been on the inside's take on that in a moment.
[00:26:14.589 --> 00:26:17.690]  But I wanted to play this clip because the guys have been trying to get me to play this for a week.
[00:26:18.191 --> 00:26:19.872]  There's a bunch of these, but I'm only going to play one of them now.
[00:26:21.001 --> 00:26:26.365]  Here I am in 2018 predicting exactly what's happening now.
[00:26:26.405 --> 00:26:27.546]  But I wasn't predicting it.
[00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:28.466]  It's a blueprint.
[00:26:28.666 --> 00:26:29.847]  We just weren't here yet.
[00:26:30.408 --> 00:26:32.849]  And I'm going to tell you next hour what's coming next if we fail.
[00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.632]  Because if anybody wants to give up and evacuate, go ahead now.
[00:26:36.652 --> 00:26:37.553]  Because it's that bad.
[00:26:37.693 --> 00:26:39.414]  Or you might just decide to stand up and say no.
[00:26:39.754 --> 00:26:41.615]  But don't sit on the fence, folks.
[00:26:41.796 --> 00:26:43.036]  There's no time for that now.
[00:26:43.097 --> 00:26:43.537]  That's over.
[00:26:45.589 --> 00:26:47.450]  The good news is we've been preparing for this for a long time.
[00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.871]  We knew the Globals were going to make this move.
[00:26:49.371 --> 00:26:54.815]  We have the people and the will and the capacity to defeat this, but they know we're winning politically.
[00:26:54.835 --> 00:26:56.276]  That's why they're going to overturn the chessboard.
[00:26:56.576 --> 00:26:59.118]  So we have to be ready for the fact that they're coming with violence.
[00:26:59.338 --> 00:27:00.459]  This is just the first wave.
[00:27:00.479 --> 00:27:05.002]  It's going to get more targeted, but let's go ahead and go to this prediction.
[00:27:06.257 --> 00:27:07.938]  They are taking over the U.S.
[00:27:08.038 --> 00:27:09.418]  They are creating the racial division.
[00:27:09.939 --> 00:27:11.519]  They are creating the sexual division.
[00:27:11.879 --> 00:27:18.262]  They are creating all of the admitted crises in this country in their own admissions in WikiLeaks.
[00:27:18.622 --> 00:27:22.664]  And they're horrified to see the economy coming back and all these good things happening.
[00:27:22.684 --> 00:27:29.567]  So they're going to throw their full force against America in an attempt to encircle Congress with a million people.
[00:27:30.347 --> 00:27:37.511]  And then to begin violent actions to run the patriots in DC out of the swamp so they can reestablish it.
[00:27:38.311 --> 00:27:40.052]  They believe that they're cornered.
[00:27:40.473 --> 00:27:41.993]  They know humanity's waking up.
[00:27:42.254 --> 00:27:50.198]  And so they're going to launch their full assault of violence and intimidation and terrorist attacks, I believe, in this country.
[00:27:50.798 --> 00:27:53.160]  They've got all the Democratic Party talking heads saying,
[00:27:54.446 --> 00:27:57.307]  Attack Trump supporters, bully them, kick them out of restaurants.
[00:27:57.587 --> 00:28:16.132]  And when you see the weak-minded people they've got lined up to support them and to chant, they're all professors or government workers or little scared leftists that bought into the fact that they were on the winning team and they were the cool group and they ran everything and they were going to teach flyover country and Christians and veterans and everybody.
[00:28:17.586 --> 00:28:18.807]  They were the ruling class.
[00:28:18.907 --> 00:28:22.349]  These people don't believe in the dream of human empowerment.
[00:28:22.369 --> 00:28:26.231]  They believe in China and its enslavement of their own population.
[00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:27.852]  They believe in authoritarianism.
[00:28:27.892 --> 00:28:31.534]  They believe if they go kiss the ass of the globalists, they are in power.
[00:28:31.854 --> 00:28:32.594]  InfoWars.
[00:28:32.954 --> 00:28:34.575]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:28:35.456 --> 00:28:36.936]  So, Thomas Speciel joins us.
[00:28:37.157 --> 00:28:38.557]  ThomasSpeciel.com.
[00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:41.319]  Is that the best site for people to visit to find your Senate campaign, Tom?
[00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:42.980]  It is, Alex.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:43.460]  Yes, it is.
[00:28:44.246 --> 00:28:50.011]  I already played what you had to say to the city council at the start of the show, but we'll probably get to more of that later.
[00:28:50.031 --> 00:28:52.873]  But just big picture in the time we have, we're going to break in five minutes.
[00:28:53.594 --> 00:29:00.880]  From your experience around the world and being involved in army intelligence, the rest of it, have I overstated the peril the country's in right now?
[00:29:03.136 --> 00:29:06.657]  Before, I would say, no, you have not overstated the peril.
[00:29:06.917 --> 00:29:11.679]  I think where we differ, and I think you've got some security clearances that I don't have, okay, Alex?
[00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:18.941]  You've got some security clearances I don't have, but I have the highest level security clearances you can have in the United States government.
[00:29:19.562 --> 00:29:23.104]  And I've had that for about the last 10 years.
[00:29:23.604 --> 00:29:28.386]  You know, my background is 28 years in the Army and the Army Reserves.
[00:29:28.426 --> 00:29:39.751]  For the last 10 years, I've worked in the intelligence community at the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Counterterrorism Center, the Defense Combating Terrorism Center, and for the Office of Director of National Intelligence.
[00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:44.553]  And I want to provide some clarity.
[00:29:46.094 --> 00:29:46.574]  There is a threat
[00:29:49.096 --> 00:29:54.118]  Right now, in the United States, you call it the Deep State.
[00:29:54.699 --> 00:30:02.602]  What I call it is, it's essentially a global socialist agenda to eradicate liberty.
[00:30:03.242 --> 00:30:06.604]  That would be the way that I would phrase it.
[00:30:06.624 --> 00:30:07.464]  It's a cult!
[00:30:08.225 --> 00:30:15.268]  And the reason for that is, and why the President has posed such a threat to this,
[00:30:16.428 --> 00:30:23.131]  Is because he cannot be managed by any of the people that are normally in power.
[00:30:23.211 --> 00:30:29.693]  The party bureaucrats on either side, he's not held accountable to any of them.
[00:30:30.393 --> 00:30:36.456]  And so because of that, they fear his ability to vanquish them ultimately.
[00:30:36.596 --> 00:30:36.876]  And that's
[00:30:37.958 --> 00:30:39.179]  That's really where we're at right now.
[00:30:39.219 --> 00:30:58.210]  And I think if you saw what I said yesterday at the Prince William County Board of Supervisors meeting, to sum it up, the reason these people are protesting, originally it's because of the murder of a black man in the streets of Minneapolis.
[00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:05.014]  And that's a horrific thing to have happened.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:11.463]  But my point is, is that this kind of stuff has been happening for decades in the United States.
[00:31:11.783 --> 00:31:17.186]  And it's only now because of, you know, handheld camera phones that it's starting to be captured.
[00:31:17.206 --> 00:31:20.647]  And I'm not saying that all police are racist.
[00:31:20.707 --> 00:31:21.788]  I'm not saying anything like that.
[00:31:22.108 --> 00:31:28.091]  What I'm saying is, is that the relationship between these people and government is what
[00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:29.114]  Well, um...
[00:31:45.712 --> 00:31:53.097]  My point is that this kind of stuff with regard to the government and tyranny has been going on for decades.
[00:31:53.437 --> 00:31:57.100]  So out here in Virginia, we have this big battle with the governor.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.961]  He's trying to suspend the Second Amendment.
[00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:00.882]  He's trying to criminalize law-abiding citizens.
[00:32:01.263 --> 00:32:07.607]  So we protest, armed, in Richmond, and this guy declares a state of emergency before anybody was even in town.
[00:32:08.314 --> 00:32:24.301]  Okay, in this case, this happens and it took them four days to declare a state of emergency and they're burning churches, they're burning police stations, they're brutalizing citizens, they're burning businesses, and it takes them four days to respond.
[00:32:24.441 --> 00:32:34.505]  The reason for that is that they're afraid to confront them because they know deep down, like I said in my citizens time yesterday,
[00:32:36.486 --> 00:32:38.489]  They are responsible for this.
[00:32:39.129 --> 00:32:45.898]  They have created this government dependency and they have stripped them of all power in society.
[00:32:46.218 --> 00:32:50.143]  So when something like this happens, they know they're not going to get any form of justice.
[00:32:53.106 --> 00:33:00.527]  They have basically thrown... And so we're getting a stand down, which is what the psych warfare experts knew they were going to get, which then causes the further breakdown of civilization.
[00:33:00.747 --> 00:33:05.148]  And then it ends with them saying Trump isn't doing his job, even though everybody's trying to handicap him.
[00:33:05.168 --> 00:33:06.108]  So let's talk about this.
[00:33:06.468 --> 00:33:12.289]  But Tom, especially when we come back and get into what you would have said if you had more time in the city council and where you think this is going.
[00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:16.150]  And when you talk about security clearances, you know, higher ones, I know that you're being sarcastic.
[00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:20.071]  I study what the Atlantic Council, the CFR say, what their plans are.
[00:33:20.231 --> 00:33:21.091]  They usually tell you.
[00:33:21.431 --> 00:33:24.234]  They're a bunch of sick, anti-American, just, enemies.
[00:33:24.714 --> 00:33:25.835]  And I know their plan.
[00:33:26.115 --> 00:33:29.058]  And I can see the predictive programming in Hollywood, so we know what their next step's gonna be.
[00:33:29.078 --> 00:33:30.680]  It's a total overthrow of the U.S.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.000]  government.
[00:33:32.603 --> 00:33:34.384]  And Thomas Speciale is our guest.
[00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:36.505]  ThomasSpeciale.com.
[00:33:36.965 --> 00:33:40.327]  That's ThomasSpeciale.com.
[00:33:41.088 --> 00:33:57.396]  And we're, again, going to play, start of the next segment, his statements there to one of the major city councils in Virginia, where we've seen this perfect parallel with the governor refusing to send National Guard to D.C., right up the road, with them acting like gun owners.
[00:33:57.697 --> 00:34:00.498]  Coming together was just an act of terrorism, but no one got hurt.
[00:34:00.518 --> 00:34:01.899]  I think it was only like one arrest.
[00:34:03.587 --> 00:34:24.736]  The perfect juxtapose there, but just starting over from the beginning about from your research and where you've been, your experiences and other colleagues you talked to, where we are and what Americans can do to turn this around and stop this socialist, globalist agenda, which is now
[00:34:25.996 --> 00:34:30.437]  Out in the open, it's really emerged and is making its move.
[00:34:30.477 --> 00:34:41.980]  And certainly getting Trump elected and getting Bolsonaro elected and other things means we're on the offensive with 1776 worldwide, as I call it, the next leg of the Renaissance, a pro-human future.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.301]  And so we have elicited their main counter-offensive, is what I would call it.
[00:34:46.841 --> 00:34:51.962]  And I just think Americans need to know how real this is and how historic it is so we're not caught flat-footed.
[00:34:51.982 --> 00:34:54.843]  But you've got the floor for the next 10 minutes here that we have left in this segment.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.781]  You're 100% right.
[00:34:57.801 --> 00:35:02.467]  You know, one of the things that I think most people don't understand is that this
[00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:14.856]  The dilemma between essentially the haves and the have-nots in the world is something that's been going on elsewhere in the world for several years now.
[00:35:15.376 --> 00:35:20.920]  It's really just starting to come home here because of the fact that Donald Trump's been in power for three years.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.621]  They expect that he will be reelected.
[00:35:22.981 --> 00:35:27.564]  And as a result of that, something has to be done to change the calculus.
[00:35:28.165 --> 00:35:36.580]  Something has to be done and you know one of the things I mentioned when I spoke yesterday was just just a few weeks right before the COVID-19 shutdown.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.304]  I was talking to a co-worker.
[00:35:39.232 --> 00:35:42.674]  And I was like, you know, this is a global event.
[00:35:43.335 --> 00:35:50.619]  And I knew at the time, if you go back and look at some of the videos that I put out early on, I was very skeptical from the very beginning.
[00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:59.324]  And I understand you're looking at things that are sort of in open source, what we call it as an Intel person, we call it open source.
[00:35:59.645 --> 00:36:04.508]  And you're looking at sort of gray areas where people don't normally spend a lot of time researching.
[00:36:04.548 --> 00:36:06.649]  That seems to me where you're getting a lot of this insight.
[00:36:07.089 --> 00:36:12.753]  And for me, as an intel officer, I have to rely on like actual signals intelligence.
[00:36:12.813 --> 00:36:18.238]  I have to rely on what world leaders are actually saying, what government leaders are actually saying, what are their plans.
[00:36:18.558 --> 00:36:21.880]  Sometimes we actually get to read their plans, okay?
[00:36:23.061 --> 00:36:33.449]  And so the threat that America poses to China right now is, I mean, if you look at what was happening right before this all happened,
[00:36:34.085 --> 00:36:40.731]  We had Chinese citizens singing our national anthem in English in Hong Kong.
[00:36:41.471 --> 00:36:56.824]  You better believe this terrified the Communist Chinese because if they decide that they want liberty the way we have liberty, they have the human power to overthrow the Communist Party.
[00:36:56.924 --> 00:37:01.068]  They have it in their capability to do it and I believe there's a lot of the Communist Army
[00:37:02.051 --> 00:37:05.093]  That would side with the people against the communist government.
[00:37:05.193 --> 00:37:06.214]  They, I believe that.
[00:37:06.654 --> 00:37:11.477]  And I think they were terrified of that emergence.
[00:37:11.958 --> 00:37:19.823]  And so then the other thing is, is you look at what was going on in Iran, where the Iranians are walking around an American flag in the streets of Tehran.
[00:37:20.483 --> 00:37:23.505]  That'll get you beaten and probably killed in Tehran.
[00:37:23.745 --> 00:37:26.367]  Okay, that is like a, that is a very, very dangerous.
[00:37:26.387 --> 00:37:27.428]  You're supposed to stomp on it.
[00:37:29.171 --> 00:37:31.093]  Correct, or burn it.
[00:37:31.413 --> 00:37:40.922]  And this was when we were really putting maximum pressure on Iran to try and get the Iranian regime to stop posing a threat to the Middle East.
[00:37:41.383 --> 00:37:49.751]  So what I'm getting at is these totalitarian governments are beginning to see that our
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:56.461]  message or light of liberty is starting to permeate into their world and it is threatening their power.
[00:37:56.902 --> 00:38:06.004]  And so as a result of that, and I'm not one of those people, I have not read anything classified that says, you know, that the Chinese virus was created by the Chinese government.
[00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:07.744]  I haven't read anything like that.
[00:38:07.924 --> 00:38:10.665]  I believe worst case scenario, this is an accident.
[00:38:11.345 --> 00:38:13.666]  I'm sorry, best case scenario, this is probably an accident.
[00:38:13.886 --> 00:38:16.787]  Worst case scenario, you know, they're going to pretend that it's an accident.
[00:38:20.087 --> 00:38:26.712]  But my point is, is that when it happened, they saw it as an opportunity to terrify the world into submission.
[00:38:27.352 --> 00:38:28.273]  And that's what this is.
[00:38:28.453 --> 00:38:34.037]  And, you know, if you look at what, you know, you said something, you said something, they revealed themselves.
[00:38:34.057 --> 00:38:39.480]  You know, I'm actually getting ready to make another speech like I did.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.482]  I did the Thomas Paine common sense speech in Richmond on May 1st.
[00:38:43.603 --> 00:38:46.465]  But I'm getting ready to do another one that's historically relevant.
[00:38:48.891 --> 00:39:08.159]  It's funny how, even throughout our American history, our wise political conservative leaders have warned of the threat of this socialist communist agenda, and they get into power and they make change, but then they're run back out with all the free handouts.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:18.244]  And so when I say they've revealed themselves, you know, our governor here in Richmond basically declared himself an enemy of the people.
[00:39:19.159 --> 00:39:31.045]  Okay, when he declared a state of emergency during Lobby Day on January 20th, I contacted his office and I said, hey, listen, I have a higher level security clearance than you do.
[00:39:31.685 --> 00:39:35.887]  I want to see the threat reporting that shows, and if he'd have showed me the threat reporting,
[00:39:36.571 --> 00:39:43.014]  I would have gone publicly and said hey there's a legitimate threat out there because I know what a legitimate threat looks like because that's all I've done for the last 10 years.
[00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:44.134]  That's my dog.
[00:39:44.214 --> 00:39:59.421]  It's okay but instead it was just a giant, giant hype trying to see everybody's terrorist and it really scared them when nothing violent happened and it went off perfectly that really showed them the power of the people that could remove these tyrants at any time and so China was incubating this using it
[00:39:59.881 --> 00:40:00.181]  Thank you.
[00:40:16.454 --> 00:40:19.036]  They're saying it's mutated, where it's not even dangerous now.
[00:40:19.336 --> 00:40:19.877]  Here's another one.
[00:40:20.357 --> 00:40:24.360]  Enraged Italians abandon masks, denounce pandemic as scam.
[00:40:25.001 --> 00:40:27.203]  Riots expose virus, lockdown hoax.
[00:40:27.863 --> 00:40:29.825]  Governors pivot on mass gatherings.
[00:40:29.925 --> 00:40:31.046]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:40:31.286 --> 00:40:31.866]  Please continue.
[00:40:32.907 --> 00:40:41.094]  Yeah, no, and you know, one of the, so what I theorized about three weeks before the total shutdown, I was like, you know,
[00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:47.368]  The last thing we need right now is what I call a mosaic of crisis.
[00:40:48.028 --> 00:40:48.289]  OK?
[00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:55.973]  The mosaic of crisis was, you know, this was in the early stages of when COVID-19 was being said to be, oh, you know, it's a global pandemic.
[00:40:56.033 --> 00:40:58.055]  And that's when Trump first shut off the borders.
[00:40:59.813 --> 00:41:04.115]  And I was like, this doesn't sound, it sounds like a hoax to me.
[00:41:04.255 --> 00:41:06.617]  It's almost too apocalyptic.
[00:41:06.757 --> 00:41:08.498]  You know, two million people dead.
[00:41:08.538 --> 00:41:10.178]  We need 40,000 ventilators.
[00:41:10.499 --> 00:41:13.700]  I was like, this sounds like an apocalyptic hoax to me, right?
[00:41:14.421 --> 00:41:18.623]  Like, you know, the 2000 hoax or, you know, whatever.
[00:41:19.283 --> 00:41:22.485]  And so what I said was,
[00:41:23.436 --> 00:41:25.797]  The last thing we need is a mosaic of crisis.
[00:41:26.197 --> 00:41:33.959]  A mosaic of crisis is when you have several events that build pressure, build pressure, build pressure, build pressure within society.
[00:41:34.279 --> 00:41:42.622]  So the last thing, and I was sitting around with a very smart friend of mine last night, one of my kitchen cabinet, and we were theorizing, what is the next Black Swan event?
[00:41:43.082 --> 00:41:44.803]  What is the next thing that's going to happen?
[00:41:44.823 --> 00:41:50.204]  And it's something we can't anticipate, we can't plan for, that's going to further
[00:41:52.355 --> 00:41:55.316]  Further imbalance of the power in America.
[00:41:55.396 --> 00:42:00.377]  So is it going to be a terrorist attack?
[00:42:00.657 --> 00:42:01.357]  A mass shooting?
[00:42:02.378 --> 00:42:20.243]  Is it going to be a coordinated Antifa or racial militia coordinated attack on several locations in one city or on several groups of protesters?
[00:42:22.242 --> 00:42:24.084]  Where it ratchets up the problem.
[00:42:24.184 --> 00:42:26.607]  Is it going to be a hurricane or an earthquake?
[00:42:26.667 --> 00:42:31.032]  You know, I don't know, but what I'm saying is... What about an attack on infrastructure?
[00:42:31.072 --> 00:42:34.396]  The point is, is that you're just going what you can prove.
[00:42:34.496 --> 00:42:36.819]  Looks like China used it, staged it to get power.
[00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:38.681]  The media tried to cover up, it was man-made.
[00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:39.422]  Now we know it was.
[00:42:39.762 --> 00:42:41.044]  That way they could patent it and control it.
[00:42:41.064 --> 00:42:42.385]  I mean, I've got the backstory on it, but...
[00:42:43.226 --> 00:42:52.135]  Clearly, there are global forces using crises to say everything Trump does is bad, to try to stymie the response, to drive him out via 25th Amendment.
[00:42:52.375 --> 00:42:55.158]  So, I mean, that's what their plan is over at the Atlantic Council.
[00:42:55.498 --> 00:43:01.044]  Their plan is to create such hell that basically Trump is drug out of office, 25th Amendment.
[00:43:04.734 --> 00:43:14.538]  I have some friends that are pretty close to the administration, and opposition as well to the Never Trumper people.
[00:43:15.918 --> 00:43:18.940]  And I don't think that you could pull off the 25th Amendment.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.360]  I don't think you could pull that off.
[00:43:23.693 --> 00:43:28.917]  I believe it's more focused on trying to damage his reelection.
[00:43:29.018 --> 00:43:31.800]  That's what they're going for, bare minimum, but they're gambling.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.422]  Look at Russiagate, spying on the president, lying about it.
[00:43:34.682 --> 00:43:37.504]  These people, I agree with you, it's a long shot, but they're crazy.
[00:43:37.985 --> 00:43:40.747]  That's my point, because they keep getting caught and they never get in trouble.
[00:43:41.247 --> 00:43:44.450]  We're going to be right back with our number two, with our special guest.
[00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:48.653]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:43:50.435 --> 00:43:51.756]  Thomas Speciale is our guest.
[00:43:51.816 --> 00:43:52.537]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:54.159 --> 00:43:55.420]  The weather's still about 30 after.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:02.123]  And then I'm going to play a bunch of videos of police being shot and killed.
[00:44:03.144 --> 00:44:08.287]  And I'm going to tell you their names, because they're not doing that on the national news.
[00:44:08.787 --> 00:44:17.972]  And I was just in there during the break heating my coffee up, and they were just up there, George Floyd, on and on and on.
[00:44:18.052 --> 00:44:19.453]  And I feel sorry for that guy.
[00:44:20.802 --> 00:44:23.002]  And I'm not glad he died, but it's like this new religion.
[00:44:23.043 --> 00:44:29.224]  I get on my knees and I say I'm bad and it's terrible that he had more fentanyl in his body than most people could survive.
[00:44:29.484 --> 00:44:32.185]  And, you know, he's involved in all this weird, shady stuff.
[00:44:32.205 --> 00:44:37.386]  I mean, it's ridiculous how I'm supposed to cry and get upset about one thing and say I'm guilty.
[00:44:37.826 --> 00:44:41.006]  And then meanwhile, there's people being killed and murdered and losing their lives everywhere.
[00:44:41.026 --> 00:44:42.567]  And the media is covering it up.
[00:44:42.627 --> 00:44:43.067]  It's sick.
[00:44:44.617 --> 00:44:45.338]  Absolutely sick.
[00:44:46.198 --> 00:44:52.804]  But Thomas, this is a short segment and some stations don't carry it, so we'll just get a side issue here now and then get into the big picture.
[00:44:53.825 --> 00:45:06.676]  We'll come back in a few minutes because I saw you nodding your head when their plan probably won't succeed, 25th Amendment, but they're so crazy and they've already gotten away with these bold moves before that, again, they'll probably take another shot at it.
[00:45:06.736 --> 00:45:09.859]  But what are some of the other points and topics you want to get into when we come back?
[00:45:11.352 --> 00:45:25.647]  When we get back, I'd really like to talk a little bit about Flynn and the attempted coup against the President, but one thing I wanted to add real quick is there's going to be some consequences after this crisis, after this mosaic of crisis, that's not being talked about.
[00:45:25.987 --> 00:45:27.329]  America, I believe, will recover.
[00:45:27.429 --> 00:45:28.770]  Our economy is very strong.
[00:45:29.311 --> 00:45:33.215]  We will, our economy will probably recover, but the break in the food chain
[00:45:33.795 --> 00:45:36.077]  We'll have a global effect, I believe, on the third world.
[00:45:36.658 --> 00:45:41.282]  And that break in the food chain could cost the life of 30 million people over the course of the next six months.
[00:45:42.023 --> 00:45:49.210]  So, and that's just a number that I've heard kind of bantered around at like UN, sort of in a UN conversation type level.
[00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:55.376]  Yeah, that's the head of the World Food Program says 33 million will probably die in the next six months to a year, potentially 134 million have slid into it.
[00:45:58.055 --> 00:46:12.712]  Yeah, and so this is the real objective, because they can't militarily dominate the United States, but what they can do is they can become in as the saving guardian angel of these hungry, starving people.
[00:46:13.638 --> 00:46:20.901]  With a Chinese workforce like never before seen into Africa.
[00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:22.622]  You just said it.
[00:46:22.662 --> 00:46:26.363]  How will China exploit this global snarl?
[00:46:26.523 --> 00:46:27.164]  That's key.
[00:46:27.984 --> 00:46:32.026]  The number one thing that they're exporting right now is goodwill to the third world.
[00:46:32.546 --> 00:46:34.807]  That is the number one thing that China is doing.
[00:46:34.887 --> 00:46:42.750]  The Belt and Road Initiative, these initiatives are designed to build goodwill with the Chinese government.
[00:46:43.582 --> 00:46:46.343]  And ultimately, they used to look to us for that.
[00:46:47.103 --> 00:47:00.707]  But we have so atrophied, because of the socialist agenda, to tamp down on our external influence in the world, because they view that as racist.
[00:47:01.587 --> 00:47:07.449]  It's okay for the Chinese to do it, but it's not going to be okay for us to do it and spread values of liberty and freedom.
[00:47:07.569 --> 00:47:12.510]  Instead, we're going to allow the Chinese to spread values of dependency and
[00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:20.295]  By the way, the United States, for those that don't know, goes in and literally builds the ports, everything, just gives them away, and then multinationals get them.
[00:47:20.675 --> 00:47:25.439]  China's coming into Africa in places and saying, no, we get everything now, totally exploiting the people.
[00:47:25.799 --> 00:47:31.343]  By the goodwill, they buy off the leaders, but then absolutely try to create a further dependency.
[00:47:31.583 --> 00:47:35.165]  The Chinese communists do not want to make people self-sufficient in Africa.
[00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:36.386]  It's very cold-blooded, what I've seen.
[00:47:37.587 --> 00:47:40.209]  And they're essentially buying these countries.
[00:47:41.129 --> 00:47:42.049]  That's really what they're doing.
[00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:46.390]  They're essentially buying them by going in and they do all these big infrastructure projects.
[00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:50.011]  They give these loans to these countries that they'll never be able to repay.
[00:47:50.771 --> 00:47:56.612]  Ultimately, it bonds them to the Chinese government for the next hundred years.
[00:47:57.032 --> 00:47:59.532]  This is the biggest problem I believe America has.
[00:47:59.552 --> 00:48:00.152]  No, I totally agree.
[00:48:00.172 --> 00:48:01.953]  Let's come back and talk about that because let's be honest.
[00:48:02.373 --> 00:48:04.893]  Under the whole Rockefeller New World Order system, the U.S.
[00:48:04.933 --> 00:48:08.414]  did that but never made them follow our values to get all that.
[00:48:09.014 --> 00:48:12.195]  Now, instead, China's the new role of taking over the planet.
[00:48:12.915 --> 00:48:17.417]  Instead of the American Century, you have the New World Order, Chi-Com Nightmare Century.
[00:48:17.457 --> 00:48:19.417]  We'll be right back with our special guest.
[00:48:19.477 --> 00:48:20.438]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:48:20.738 --> 00:48:21.758]  NewsWars.com.
[00:48:21.778 --> 00:48:22.638]  Please share those links.
[00:48:25.759 --> 00:48:27.160]  Thomas Speciale is our guest.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.420]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:29.460]  He's running for Senate.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.221]  ThomasSpeciale.com.
[00:48:32.941 --> 00:48:34.122]  Let's get down to brass tacks.
[00:48:35.282 --> 00:48:36.282]  We're starting to get close.
[00:48:37.363 --> 00:48:37.823]  You see,
[00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:55.598]  Senator Cruz come out, and Senator Cotton come out, and others, and they've got the intelligence briefings, just like our guests at that level, and they're, hey, Twitter lets Communist China run around and actually try to meddle in our election and put out disinfo, but the President's tweets are censored?
[00:48:56.658 --> 00:49:01.879]  And now the Mullahs can like call for blowing up Israel in the U.S., actually call for terror attacks?
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.401]  I mean, look, if I went on Twitter and said, blow something up, I'd get arrested.
[00:49:06.741 --> 00:49:07.721]  Why are they allowed to do that?
[00:49:08.241 --> 00:49:08.581]  Okay?
[00:49:09.061 --> 00:49:14.883]  And I don't want to blow anything up, by the way, except the ideology of communism, globalism, and all this transhumanist crap.
[00:49:15.863 --> 00:49:16.964]  I'm winning the intellectual war.
[00:49:17.024 --> 00:49:18.205]  I don't need to blow things up.
[00:49:18.645 --> 00:49:21.987]  But the left and the antifa are linked up with these big foundations.
[00:49:22.007 --> 00:49:24.789]  They're getting a ton of Chinese money on record through the Confucius Institutes.
[00:49:25.249 --> 00:49:30.092]  And they're out there bullying and attacking anybody who tries to go have free speech or anybody that tries to go demonstrate.
[00:49:30.453 --> 00:49:31.413]  They point guns at us.
[00:49:31.453 --> 00:49:32.714]  They attack our vehicles.
[00:49:32.754 --> 00:49:35.356]  We had to buy an armored vehicle to be able to go cover these things.
[00:49:35.376 --> 00:49:37.037]  And they climbed all over like ants.
[00:49:37.817 --> 00:49:38.838]  And the police did nothing.
[00:49:39.238 --> 00:49:41.940]  So the real breakdown of civilization is beginning to happen.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.061]  That's the leftist plan.
[00:49:44.056 --> 00:50:05.341]  And if there is an open discussion in the Pentagon and at the other states inside the United States that have their heads screwed on partway straight, we're underestimating, in my view, just how evil these multinational globalists are because they're these boards of multinationals and they can put pressure here, put pressure there, but none of them ever really have the buck stopped with them.
[00:50:05.841 --> 00:50:09.042]  So these corporate heads are engaged in military activity.
[00:50:09.942 --> 00:50:34.167]  On the side of authoritarianism because they've bet all their money on China and they're really engaging in things under any other system they'd get arrested or killed for and we're just sitting here flat-footed watching this multinational takeover as China as the favorite son being propped up and the Washington Post saying Xi Jinping must destroy Trump to save America and all I'm saying Thomas is
[00:50:34.807 --> 00:50:38.931]  Because you've been in Special Forces and the National Terrorism Center and Defense Intelligence Agencies.
[00:50:38.971 --> 00:50:43.255]  You said you have the highest level clearances and have a lot of great contacts.
[00:50:44.895 --> 00:50:47.317]  Do people see what I'm talking about?
[00:50:47.337 --> 00:50:49.759]  Because what I'm talking about is really going on.
[00:50:49.819 --> 00:50:50.700]  This is the reality.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:51:09.174]  The whole world's ganged up on America, and I see so many Americans not understanding that, and it makes me sick that not only is their own interest at stake, authoritarians are taking over, are trying to muscle in on us, and we should have 99% of Americans backing the president and restoring the republic, and instead the media is so evil.
[00:51:09.975 --> 00:51:16.522]  That most people, who are even conservative, think this is all funny, and that the left are idiots, and that Trump's assured of winning.
[00:51:16.702 --> 00:51:18.264]  They don't understand how much danger we're in.
[00:51:18.464 --> 00:51:19.085]  That's my view.
[00:51:21.127 --> 00:51:22.028]  I agree.
[00:51:22.088 --> 00:51:22.869]  We are in danger.
[00:51:22.909 --> 00:51:26.073]  And there are a lot of people out there who see the danger.
[00:51:26.093 --> 00:51:28.996]  I don't think that
[00:51:33.689 --> 00:51:42.796]  That people see the danger from the perspective that you and I do as a global threat.
[00:51:44.097 --> 00:51:45.678]  There are a lot of people who don't see that.
[00:51:46.338 --> 00:51:48.640]  It's becoming more clear to people though.
[00:51:49.381 --> 00:51:59.712]  And so, you know, they've been able to hide behind the fact that, you know, organizations like CNN and, you know, the liberal media controlled the narrative so well it was hidden.
[00:52:00.113 --> 00:52:09.043]  But because of Fox News, because of the conservative news channels, because of, you know, InfoWars, because of the fact that people are out there, you're providing people with
[00:52:12.847 --> 00:52:18.611]  With raw information a lot of times that they can go look up themselves and find out what's true and what isn't.
[00:52:19.051 --> 00:52:19.991]  Okay, you're challenging.
[00:52:20.292 --> 00:52:34.940]  Essentially, what I believe InfoWars, for me, what InfoWars does is it challenges the milquetoast narratives that a lot of times we hear from, you know, the so-called conservatives, the political machine, Republicans even.
[00:52:35.692 --> 00:52:49.061]  Um, but what you were getting at regarding, you know, Twitter and things like that, the reason they don't, that they don't do that, that they don't tamp down on Iran and, you know, they don't do that, is because that would be racist if they did that.
[00:52:49.541 --> 00:53:04.291]  Or that would be, you know, um, I don't know if it's part of, I don't know if it's part of it, like, part of the agenda, except it's part of the, the, the philosophy of liberalism that
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:09.902]  Only they should be the purveyors of power.
[00:53:10.423 --> 00:53:15.125]  You know, I'm working on this speech that I'm going to be giving and I'm going to be recording it tonight and putting it out tomorrow, so be on the lookout for it.
[00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:16.886]  It's got a lot of the things in it you're saying.
[00:53:17.927 --> 00:53:32.214]  But what they are trying to convince people is, is that only they, and I mean by that these Democrat elite, polo club elites, like my opponent in this race in Virginia, Mark Warner, they think they're smarter than the masses.
[00:53:33.064 --> 00:53:38.570]  And they have gotten a lot of the masses convinced that they actually have their best interest at heart.
[00:53:39.071 --> 00:53:51.484]  But then what they've done is they've stripped them of their, they've basically stripped them of their freedom, they've stripped them of their liberty, and they've done that by saying, you know, you don't have to work, I can pay you to stay home.
[00:53:52.768 --> 00:53:54.228]  You know, don't worry about going to school.
[00:53:54.248 --> 00:53:55.469]  I'll give you a free education.
[00:53:56.009 --> 00:54:00.910]  You know, you don't worry about graduating from high school because even if you don't graduate from high school, I'm going to give you money and food and housing.
[00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:03.211]  So don't worry about being successful.
[00:54:03.251 --> 00:54:04.351]  You don't have to worry about that.
[00:54:04.431 --> 00:54:05.752]  I'm going to take care of you.
[00:54:05.912 --> 00:54:06.672]  I'm the government.
[00:54:07.432 --> 00:54:08.792]  I'm going to provide all your needs.
[00:54:09.132 --> 00:54:10.873]  And that's what we're seeing with these protests.
[00:54:11.373 --> 00:54:14.634]  These people that are protesting in the street are exactly
[00:54:15.706 --> 00:54:21.467]  The people who are the most utterly dependent on the government, and they're even dependent on them for their security.
[00:54:21.968 --> 00:54:29.049]  But what happens is, like an unruly child that is never disciplined, they just will break stuff and smash stuff.
[00:54:29.529 --> 00:54:31.310]  And then, you know, what would the liberal tell you to do?
[00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:34.951]  Oh, well, you know, don't tell him he did anything wrong.
[00:54:35.251 --> 00:54:36.631]  Ask him why he's angry.
[00:54:36.711 --> 00:54:37.752]  Talk to him about why.
[00:54:38.112 --> 00:54:39.132]  Why are you angry?
[00:54:39.192 --> 00:54:41.833]  Instead of, you know, you know, don't do that.
[00:54:42.053 --> 00:54:43.153]  You know, don't break my stuff.
[00:54:43.717 --> 00:54:45.458]  And the left knows exactly what they're doing.
[00:54:45.478 --> 00:54:47.800]  I mean, they're not giving you free stuff in China, they're slaves.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:55:00.328]  But China is seen as this great example, and you were getting into that before the break, and this next segment we should get more into that, how China is taking over the planet, how Western elites have bet on China, and as you said earlier, those views are changing.
[00:55:00.688 --> 00:55:11.115]  People realize that even with the establishment, China broke its deals with them, and so there's a real fissure, and that it's the U.S.-China split that is going to really define the next 50 years.
[00:55:12.216 --> 00:55:13.537]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:22.222]  I mean, this is really something... I mean, we're going through something right now that's unheard of, really, in world history, I think.
[00:55:22.482 --> 00:55:39.853]  Between the pandemic, the global economic shutdown, and then, you know, the economic crisis that it's causing between the rich and the poor, basically, being exacerbated by the left to try and essentially overthrow
[00:55:40.894 --> 00:55:45.379]  I don't think it will happen here in America, but it will happen anytime probably in our lifetime, but it will happen in Africa.
[00:56:02.722 --> 00:56:03.623]  We're good to go.
[00:56:32.452 --> 00:56:33.313]  Deliberately planned it.
[00:56:33.393 --> 00:56:33.653]  Oh yeah.
[00:56:33.693 --> 00:56:35.514]  But I don't think that that's the case necessarily.
[00:56:35.534 --> 00:56:42.279]  Well, they definitely choreographed the hysteria and welding people in and shooting women at checkpoints, but then said, oh, but let our planes fly into you.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.301]  Our Democrat friends are doing it too, Al.
[00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:47.562]  I mean, they fell right into this.
[00:56:48.143 --> 00:56:51.385]  If you look, they're still walking around the streets driving their cars with masks on.
[00:56:51.405 --> 00:56:53.426]  Oh yeah, they're lockstep into the hysteria.
[00:56:54.147 --> 00:56:55.208]  And the UN is our boss.
[00:56:56.018 --> 00:56:56.478]  That's correct.
[00:56:56.578 --> 00:56:58.079]  And they're so embarrassed.
[00:56:58.199 --> 00:57:15.126]  I believe the ones that have come to their realization how stupid they are and how foolish they were to fall for this, they are so bullheaded that they won't admit that it's ludicrous for them to drive around like that.
[00:57:15.146 --> 00:57:15.966]  It's cognitive dissonance.
[00:57:17.206 --> 00:57:17.407]  Yeah.
[00:57:17.587 --> 00:57:18.267]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:57:19.008 --> 00:57:19.608]  Absolutely.
[00:57:19.668 --> 00:57:30.111]  They cannot admit to themselves how foolish they were to have, and I have, you can tell if you watch your friends on Facebook and you know what, they were like, you know, you must wear a mask to protect yourself, blah, blah, blah.
[00:57:30.431 --> 00:57:36.292]  Now all of a sudden, no mention of COVID-19 and how dangerous it is because they know now it was a bunch of bunk.
[00:57:36.952 --> 00:57:38.052]  Well, they are true followers.
[00:57:38.072 --> 00:57:40.553]  They do whatever the comment is, Chinese, the WHO, tell them.
[00:57:40.893 --> 00:57:44.274]  So since you raised this, Thomas, especially Ali, I want to come back
[00:57:45.282 --> 00:57:48.164]  And look at how the COVID hoax officially is done.
[00:57:48.224 --> 00:57:50.926]  German government, interior ministry says it's a total hoax.
[00:57:51.566 --> 00:57:55.409]  CNBC's having to say, okay, top scientists just say it just basically doesn't exist.
[00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:58.031]  Not even a bad pneumonia.
[00:57:58.811 --> 00:58:02.814]  And we're just supposed to jump to the next thing, race war, and then jump to the next thing and jump to the next thing.
[00:58:03.094 --> 00:58:08.097]  And as you said, with this cascade or this mosaic of threats, what is coming next?
[00:58:08.778 --> 00:58:10.399]  And of course, everybody knows I'm very conspiratorial.
[00:58:10.659 --> 00:58:12.460]  The globals are behind every damn bit of this.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:13.221]  They're running China.
[00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:16.692]  There is an ideology of collectivism.
[00:58:17.353 --> 00:58:21.897]  People go to these colleges, they're taught that they're gonna get everything free, that they're gonna be members of this new ruling class.
[00:58:23.118 --> 00:58:30.184]  But the big mega banks, the big power brokers, they promote it because it makes people dependent, it makes them non-competitive, it makes them very easy to control.
[00:58:30.805 --> 00:58:31.846]  They want monopolies.
[00:58:31.966 --> 00:58:36.530]  John D. Rockefeller famously said, we're not capitalist, we're monopoly men.
[00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:37.911]  We hate capitalism.
[00:58:38.712 --> 00:58:39.592]  We hate free market.
[00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:42.650]  And so, everybody knows this on its face.
[00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:49.791]  So, in closing, we'll have him back again, Thomas Beshiel, top security clearance, U.S.
[00:58:49.911 --> 00:58:52.752]  Army active duty, the National Guard, U.S.
[00:58:52.772 --> 00:59:00.494]  Special Forces, whole nine yards, Counterterrorism Center, Defense Intelligence Agency, has really made a lot of great points here and, you know, it's
[00:59:01.607 --> 00:59:10.240]  It's hard for us to admit we've been conned, and we don't always have all the answers right away, but major Indian scientists first scanned
[00:59:11.325 --> 00:59:14.586]  The virus has said it's been man-made with the HIV delivery system.
[00:59:15.046 --> 00:59:16.667]  Not HIV itself, but the delivery system.
[00:59:16.707 --> 00:59:18.048]  So it's something that a lot of people caught.
[00:59:18.068 --> 00:59:21.329]  And it's something that can be patented and owned by companies.
[00:59:21.389 --> 00:59:26.831]  It looks like they were trying to make a vaccine for SARS and coronaviruses.
[00:59:26.851 --> 00:59:28.331]  And they were doing that at that lab.
[00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:29.232]  They admit they were doing that.
[00:59:29.852 --> 00:59:31.953]  That's on German TV, Italian TV.
[00:59:34.306 --> 00:59:35.867]  It's been on Chinese TV.
[00:59:35.887 --> 00:59:36.787]  They weren't hiding it then.
[00:59:37.247 --> 00:59:37.828]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:59:37.928 --> 00:59:38.588]  It gets out.
[00:59:39.328 --> 00:59:40.989]  They decide to create all this fear and hysteria.
[00:59:41.249 --> 00:59:43.590]  Change the subject from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:45.611]  And then the West gets lockstep with it.
[00:59:46.031 --> 00:59:47.651]  And Bill and Melinda Gates panic everybody.
[00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:49.592]  The same main funders of the Wuhan facility.
[00:59:50.773 --> 00:59:58.996]  And now here we are with CNBC saying a very public dispute has broken out between Italy and the world's most high-profile doctors and scientists.
[00:59:59.296 --> 01:00:01.437]  And they now admit these are some of the top scientists in the world.
[01:00:02.537 --> 01:00:04.719]  They say, this is just a regular coronavirus.
[01:00:04.819 --> 01:00:05.900]  It's already burned itself out.
[01:00:06.321 --> 01:00:08.723]  So, wow, how big is that?
[01:00:08.743 --> 01:00:16.650]  That we're now just converting from, this is the end of the world, you can never leave your house again, you gotta wear a mask everywhere, to just, oh forget it, let's just move on.
[01:00:17.651 --> 01:00:19.733]  Where do you think that's going next, Thomas?
[01:00:19.793 --> 01:00:21.415]  And then let's get into your campaign for Senate.
[01:00:23.217 --> 01:00:30.660]  I would say if you go look at some of the early videos in about early March or mid-March when I was talking about this, that's exactly what I said, Alex.
[01:00:31.181 --> 01:00:33.802]  I said this is just a bad flu or a bad cold.
[01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:35.723]  Everybody needs to calm down.
[01:00:37.423 --> 01:00:39.624]  And, you know, of course, they weren't listening to me at that time.
[01:00:39.664 --> 01:00:40.044]  That's right.
[01:00:40.064 --> 01:00:41.585]  You shot a really good video about that.
[01:00:41.785 --> 01:00:49.268]  That was a... So, you know, where I think this is going, I think it's going to, you know, disappear very quickly because of the
[01:00:50.925 --> 01:01:04.670]  But it'll, it'll resurface during the election and they'll blame Trump for, you know, Cuomo sending a bunch of 65 and 75 year olds into nursing homes and killing off, you know, through the virus, a whole bunch of 75 plus year old people.
[01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.111]  They're going to blame that on Trump too.
[01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:09.492]  Even though Cuomo said, I'm really sorry, I made a mistake.
[01:01:09.512 --> 01:01:10.432]  They're still going to blame Trump.
[01:01:10.772 --> 01:01:11.753]  This is all about the Trump.
[01:01:11.813 --> 01:01:14.794]  It's all about the 2020 election bringing me to the campaign.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.861]  Um, you know, and I want to clear up a couple things.
[01:01:17.981 --> 01:01:20.242]  I'm an Army Reservist, not a member of the National Guard.
[01:01:20.262 --> 01:01:21.623]  I get it all confused.
[01:01:21.663 --> 01:01:22.723]  You got a long bio here.
[01:01:22.743 --> 01:01:24.304]  You're in the Chinese Navy.
[01:01:27.105 --> 01:01:34.529]  Um, I, uh, and I deployed with Special Forces, uh, the greatest soldiers that I've ever worked with, uh, ever, but I'm, I'm not a long tabber.
[01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:35.869]  I'm not a Special Forces guy.
[01:01:35.949 --> 01:01:36.870]  I'm honored to, uh,
[01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:44.205]  To remember them as the greatest soldiers that have ever lived in my mind.
[01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:45.447]  And my son wants to be one.
[01:01:45.467 --> 01:01:48.771]  And I just swore him in about six months ago, he wants to be a Green Beret.
[01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:52.129]  The campaign.
[01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:55.311]  So, out here, I'm fighting this guy Mark Warner, okay?
[01:01:55.632 --> 01:02:03.298]  I'm in a race with a couple other primary guys in the campaign right now, but neither one of these can actually beat Mark Warner.
[01:02:03.438 --> 01:02:05.160]  Mark Warner will clean their clocks.
[01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:17.891]  To take on Mark Warner, who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it's going to take somebody that can go after him regarding the bogus dossier that the Russians created to damage our republic.
[01:02:18.671 --> 01:02:20.752]  That's going to be able to go after him on his culpability.
[01:02:20.772 --> 01:02:23.012]  He tried to secretly meet with Christopher Steele.
[01:02:23.812 --> 01:02:27.273]  We still don't know why a senator would be trying to secretly meet with this guy.
[01:02:27.293 --> 01:02:34.275]  I believe I can go toe-to-toe with him because of my intelligence background and my intelligence credentials and get one of these swamp monsters out of there.
[01:02:34.295 --> 01:02:35.976]  Because that's really what Mark Warner is.
[01:02:36.016 --> 01:02:36.876]  He's a swamp monster.
[01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:40.817]  He hasn't done anything for Virginia for 11 years, okay?
[01:02:41.577 --> 01:02:43.318]  And I can beat him.
[01:02:43.598 --> 01:02:48.319]  And so, you know, people out there that are listening, you know, I'm the underdog in this fight.
[01:02:48.359 --> 01:02:49.299]  I'm a junkyard dog.
[01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:52.880]  And I don't have any of these establishment contacts.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:57.061]  You know, my primary opponent is in the pocket of the establishment.
[01:02:57.181 --> 01:02:59.202]  He's, you know, he's a Romney.
[01:02:59.382 --> 01:03:00.702]  He's a Romney Republican.
[01:03:00.762 --> 01:03:01.623]  He's a rhino.
[01:03:03.163 --> 01:03:05.904]  But I can actually go after Mark Warner in a way.
[01:03:06.584 --> 01:03:10.485]  Like, I want to make him so angry that he gets up and walks off the debate stage.
[01:03:11.124 --> 01:03:11.764]  I am.
[01:03:11.824 --> 01:03:13.205]  He's one of the worst people up there.
[01:03:13.245 --> 01:03:14.806]  He says I should be taken off the air.
[01:03:14.866 --> 01:03:15.926]  He's anti-free speech.
[01:03:16.347 --> 01:03:17.767]  I mean, he is really a piece of work.
[01:03:18.648 --> 01:03:18.988]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:19.048 --> 01:03:19.928]  No, he's he is.
[01:03:19.948 --> 01:03:21.549]  He is a he is.
[01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:37.437]  And so if you want evidence of how corrupt this guy is, if you want to know who he works for, when he was voting, casting a vote in the name of Virginia to impeach our president, OK, right before he cast.
[01:03:37.557 --> 01:03:39.598]  They each had five minutes to speak.
[01:03:40.755 --> 01:03:53.045]  Right before he spoke for his five minutes, he proceeded to bootlick Dianne Feinstein in California for a good three or four minutes about how her great leadership in the Senate and blah blah blah.
[01:03:53.305 --> 01:04:01.632]  The only reason he did that is because he wanted to bootlick for campaign donations from California, Florida, and New York.
[01:04:02.412 --> 01:04:03.313]  And that's what he did.
[01:04:04.076 --> 01:04:10.081]  That's all the evidence you need is just go look at that speech and you will know how corrupt this guy is.
[01:04:10.401 --> 01:04:11.902]  He belongs to the DNC.
[01:04:12.262 --> 01:04:14.204]  These people are all feeding at the food bowl.
[01:04:15.105 --> 01:04:25.633]  And, you know, the way I've tried to sum my campaign up is, if you like Jim Jordan, put Tom Speciality in the Senate.
[01:04:26.493 --> 01:04:29.876]  Okay, we're gonna have Jim Jordan, Tom Speciality and Donald Trump in 2020.
[01:04:30.036 --> 01:04:33.679]  And when we have that, I guarantee you, I will
[01:04:34.266 --> 01:04:37.727]  Go out and crush these swamp monsters with our president.
[01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:49.809]  Not to mention the fact that I can go after and prosecute the FBI agents that carried out illegal counterintelligence investigations against American citizens and violated their civil liberties, which Rosa Stevens is talking about today.
[01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:54.090]  That brings us in closing to Flynn.
[01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:57.371]  Why were they so scared of Flynn and where do you expect all this to go?
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:05.684]  Well, Flynn, first of all, you've got to realize he was hated by the CIA because Flynn was trying to do things with the intelligence community that the CIA didn't want to happen.
[01:05:06.024 --> 01:05:16.049]  The CIA sort of has a monopoly on clandestine intelligence operations, and Flynn wanted to expand defense clandestine intelligence operations, and so they were absolutely adamantly opposed to that.
[01:05:17.711 --> 01:05:25.658]  And so when he, and he was also speaking truth to power with the Obama administration regarding the rise of ISIS in the Middle East.
[01:05:26.318 --> 01:05:29.121]  And he wasn't toeing the party line with regard to the administration.
[01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:35.846]  He even spoke publicly to, I can't remember whether it was the House or the Senate, where he said that the administration's doing everything wrong.
[01:05:36.987 --> 01:05:39.229]  And I will leave you with this last thought.
[01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:45.875]  When Clapper was interviewed, I know how you feel about Clapper, but Clapper said something you need to remember.
[01:05:46.415 --> 01:05:55.522]  When Clapper was asked about the refugee crisis in the Middle East, when ISIS first came across the border and started beheading Christian children, Clapper was asked, what do you think of it?
[01:05:55.642 --> 01:05:58.765]  And he said, it's a problem of biblical proportions.
[01:05:59.716 --> 01:06:05.822]  When the Director of National Intelligence says that this is a problem of biblical proportions, you need to stand up and pay attention.
[01:06:06.302 --> 01:06:10.486]  And that is what Obama caused when he left Iraq.
[01:06:10.886 --> 01:06:13.248]  He created a problem of biblical proportions.
[01:06:13.548 --> 01:06:15.370]  I don't think Clapper's as bad as Brennan.
[01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:19.093]  All right, Thomas Speciali, thomasspeciali.com for Senate.
[01:06:19.113 --> 01:06:21.395]  Thanks for coming on with us and great job speaking out.
[01:06:21.415 --> 01:06:22.937]  Thank you, Howard.
[01:06:23.863 --> 01:06:25.524]  Okay, folks, that was an important interview.
[01:06:26.164 --> 01:06:31.527]  We've got so much news to hit now that's piling up and what's happening with these riots all over the country and how it's totally engineered.
[01:06:31.907 --> 01:06:40.751]  Now the controlled corporate media turns around now and says that right-wingers are staging all this and that I burned down a homeless camp.
[01:06:40.851 --> 01:06:42.412]  I mean, that's all over the news, folks.
[01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.913]  That's the level of their lies.
[01:06:45.853 --> 01:06:47.594]  They think I staged the false flag.
[01:06:47.734 --> 01:06:48.275]  Yeah, right.
[01:06:48.615 --> 01:06:48.995]  Stay with us.
[01:06:51.175 --> 01:06:55.798]  Okay, Laura Loomer, who's running for Congress, is a tough cookie.
[01:06:55.818 --> 01:06:58.539]  She's been through a lot of persecution, a lot of censorship, but she's fighting back.
[01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:02.081]  And in a lot of polls, she's in the lead where she's running there in Florida.
[01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:10.706]  But she's coming on talking about Antifa and how they're terrorists, what they've done to her, and how she does support the president designating them as a terrorist organization.
[01:07:10.966 --> 01:07:17.410]  She's put out a big, thick report detailing the evidence of that that's at her website, lauraloomer.com.
[01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:19.832]  And so that's coming up.
[01:07:20.802 --> 01:07:27.045]  Then we'll open the phones up for a couple segments before investigative journalist John Rappaport takes over.
[01:07:27.065 --> 01:07:29.747]  So I'll get the number out when we start the next hour.
[01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:37.151]  Few things irritate me more than what I'm about to cover.
[01:07:39.752 --> 01:07:41.453]  And it gets into the whole COVID-19 thing.
[01:07:41.493 --> 01:07:49.257]  So I know that everybody is obsessed with the rioting and the looting and the 25th Amendment move to get rid of the president and the
[01:07:51.607 --> 01:07:58.029]  Secretary of Defense coming out and saying, oh no, we don't need the regular army on the streets, the Insurrection Act.
[01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:03.011]  This is insurrection, funded by foreign governments to overthrow the country.
[01:08:04.452 --> 01:08:05.832]  I'm Mr. Anti-Police State.
[01:08:06.712 --> 01:08:08.333]  I'm anti-illegal surveillance.
[01:08:08.453 --> 01:08:11.594]  I'm anti-cops going to homeschoolers' houses.
[01:08:12.134 --> 01:08:16.096]  I want the borders controlled, though, and when there's insurrection, I want it stopped.
[01:08:18.356 --> 01:08:19.737]  So we've got all that coming up, too.
[01:08:21.715 --> 01:08:23.236]  In fact, I'll hit that next segment.
[01:08:24.336 --> 01:08:27.077]  But this next thing boils my blood.
[01:08:27.157 --> 01:08:28.898]  We'll hit it here in a moment.
[01:08:29.518 --> 01:08:30.459]  Let me just throw this out.
[01:08:31.679 --> 01:08:42.684]  Times are so crazy, I decided to extend the big sale we've had and just expand it to 60% off across the board on all the great supplements and many other products at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:08:43.604 --> 01:08:45.825]  It's the across the board flash sale.
[01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:49.227]  And I'm going to have to end it because
[01:08:51.348 --> 01:08:53.389]  Ultimate Krill Oil is getting close to selling out.
[01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.911]  DNA Force Plus is getting close to selling out.
[01:08:56.391 --> 01:08:58.112]  Living Defense is getting close to selling out.
[01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:00.174]  Turbo Force is getting close to selling out.
[01:09:00.214 --> 01:09:03.276]  We've got a lot of Brain Force, but at this rate, they can sell out in a few weeks.
[01:09:04.096 --> 01:09:05.817]  It's all 60% off.
[01:09:06.057 --> 01:09:07.458]  X3 Tri-Iodine.
[01:09:08.839 --> 01:09:09.960]  On the verge of selling out.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.561]  Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:09:13.142 --> 01:09:14.102]  On the verge of selling out.
[01:09:14.122 --> 01:09:16.004]  8-Pack Power Stack.
[01:09:16.024 --> 01:09:16.844]  That's at cost.
[01:09:16.864 --> 01:09:16.944]  70% off.
[01:09:18.672 --> 01:09:20.313]  Alexa Pure Breeze, $100 off.
[01:09:20.693 --> 01:09:22.173]  Storable Foods, available again.
[01:09:22.634 --> 01:09:24.034]  All the craziness, folks, you need them.
[01:09:24.134 --> 01:09:24.674]  Get them now.
[01:09:26.135 --> 01:09:28.976]  And your purchase funds this operation.
[01:09:28.996 --> 01:09:30.237]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:09:30.257 --> 01:09:40.661]  It takes a lot of money to stay on air with the satellites and the servers and the crew and the Deep State Democrats and all their lawsuits against us that are meant to shut us down but haven't so far yet.
[01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:45.889]  You've kept us in this position to keep fighting, and I want to thank you all for spending your money with us.
[01:09:45.929 --> 01:10:00.262]  But these are really amazing products, and if you've never experienced krill oil, you've never experienced PQQ and CoQ10 and what's in DNA Force Plus, if you've never experienced having good, clean iodine in your body, we've got the best out there, Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, X2 and X3.
[01:10:00.882 --> 01:10:01.683]  X3 is triiodine.
[01:10:01.723 --> 01:10:05.426]  It's got the Deep Crystal and two other types, because some people do better with all three types.
[01:10:05.847 --> 01:10:07.908]  The point is, is that these are game changers.
[01:10:08.857 --> 01:10:14.558]  Just like our information is game-changing, the products are game-changing, and I would really take advantage of those.
[01:10:15.658 --> 01:10:26.481]  We're also running the sale because I've had two new products come in, and we've got a whole other site that's being launched that's got six new products, but one of the products was late coming in.
[01:10:26.501 --> 01:10:32.982]  So we've got five of those products in, and I've just been so busy covering news and information that I've not cut new ads for the new products that are in.
[01:10:35.237 --> 01:10:39.681]  Next week we should be launching those new products that we're really excited about, and they're also critical to funding our operation.
[01:10:39.721 --> 01:10:50.389]  So, I've got to meet today on how long the sale can go, and if I had to guess, it's going to end this weekend, but I want to thank you for your support.
[01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:51.890]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:10:52.951 --> 01:10:55.613]  Okay, here's what really infuriates me.
[01:10:57.615 --> 01:10:58.656]  Because it's getting people killed.
[01:11:01.798 --> 01:11:02.419]  Media matters.
[01:11:04.281 --> 01:11:14.525]  A month and a half ago came out and said Alex Jones is saying that health care workers are killing people in New York, in Michigan, in California, and Pennsylvania.
[01:11:15.566 --> 01:11:23.869]  Those are the states that ordered nursing homes to take COVID patients when it's a bad pneumonia that only on average kills old people.
[01:11:23.889 --> 01:11:25.410]  99% of it's above the age of 70.
[01:11:27.788 --> 01:11:30.589]  So many stories about a dead kid or whatever would turn out to be a fraud.
[01:11:30.629 --> 01:11:31.730]  They were hit by a truck.
[01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:33.010]  They were gunshot wounds.
[01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:35.712]  I mean, this thing was an exercise in fraud.
[01:11:40.093 --> 01:11:42.114]  And that's the consensus even inside our own government.
[01:11:42.635 --> 01:11:47.877]  And now it's in MSNBC and CNBC and they're having to admit global experts come out and say it's a total hoax.
[01:11:50.198 --> 01:11:54.160]  But then I learned about how there were empty hospitals all over the country three months ago, four months ago.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.880]  And the news would say, oh, you're making that up.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:57.101]  And then it turned out they were empty.
[01:11:58.490 --> 01:12:10.017]  And then you'd have the medical workers dressed up in full hazmat gear, partying all day, doing absolutely nothing, getting drunk, and all that's come out now.
[01:12:10.037 --> 01:12:13.419]  People waiting and dying with heart attacks while they do TikTok videos.
[01:12:15.741 --> 01:12:22.205]  Well, the very same nurses unions that came out and said, you know, don't come out or you're a terrorist, you're a murderer, you're a criminal.
[01:12:23.953 --> 01:12:33.456]  They have now come out on the streets in full hazmat gear to like further the hysteria that, oh, you can't even go outside unless you're in a space suit.
[01:12:36.857 --> 01:12:41.619]  And of course, then they're going to go back off the street if it's so deadly and spread it around inside the hospital.
[01:12:42.099 --> 01:12:45.620]  Folks, you only put gloves on during the procedures.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.301]  You might change gloves five, six times during a surgery.
[01:12:49.838 --> 01:12:51.619]  But you go in the stores, they're wearing the gloves.
[01:12:51.639 --> 01:12:52.919]  You go in the stores, they're wearing the mask.
[01:12:52.939 --> 01:12:54.380]  It's all kabuki theater.
[01:12:56.021 --> 01:12:58.762]  You've got all the good leftists, they're the good people.
[01:12:59.262 --> 01:13:00.723]  They're all wearing their mask.
[01:13:01.943 --> 01:13:03.784]  But the Black Lives Matter, they're all white.
[01:13:04.805 --> 01:13:14.129]  Nurses who accuse stay-at-home protesters of killing Granny when they're the ones that, under leftist government, shipped the COVID patients into Granny.
[01:13:14.549 --> 01:13:19.131]  Applaud thousands of left-wing demonstrators in New York.
[01:13:20.222 --> 01:13:22.384]  Story on Infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:13:22.404 --> 01:13:22.944]  Here's the video.
[01:13:27.768 --> 01:13:30.210]  Look how dull and stupid all these liberals look.
[01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:41.839]  I mean, they're just all lazy, stupid, pothead trash that just get into how they squirrel around all day and do absolutely nothing.
[01:13:43.742 --> 01:13:47.926]  And oh, now the nurses are clapping for them, and they're clapping back.
[01:13:47.946 --> 01:13:50.028]  And this is the thing with the shaming.
[01:13:50.048 --> 01:13:53.111]  I'll be in a restaurant and let this walk over and they go, Boo!
[01:13:53.371 --> 01:13:54.112]  Boo!
[01:13:54.312 --> 01:13:54.452]  Boo!
[01:13:54.492 --> 01:13:55.433]  Everyone hates you!
[01:13:55.453 --> 01:13:57.035]  I'm like, no they don't.
[01:13:57.395 --> 01:14:01.959]  You're a sack of garbage using elementary school peer pressure on me.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:03.801]  Get out of my face.
[01:14:05.002 --> 01:14:08.926]  And then I go find the table they're at, and I get in their face, and they don't like it.
[01:14:10.126 --> 01:14:21.114]  So they edit it and say, I attack them because they're liars, they're babies, they're trash, they're dead-eyed nobodies who got all their fake degrees and were promised they were going to rule the earth.
[01:14:21.134 --> 01:14:27.999]  And now you've got the medical priest class that believes it deserves total control over all of society.
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.203]  But you notice they stopped the weekly clapping for the NIH over in England, as people saw right through it.
[01:14:35.364 --> 01:14:38.166]  And so now they've started these new things where, oh, you don't have an economy.
[01:14:38.486 --> 01:14:39.407]  You don't have any freedoms.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:58.075]  But you do have recognition that you're wearing a mask and protesting and saying America sucks and the government sucks and the police suck only because the Democrats were in the process of taking over your city or town so they can ruin it like they've done everywhere else.
[01:14:59.236 --> 01:15:03.400]  And that leads us to this before I come back and get into the military and Trump and all the rest of it.
[01:15:04.949 --> 01:15:06.830]  Stories are from Macworld.
[01:15:07.651 --> 01:15:13.295]  Apple Music participates in Blackout Tuesday, but you can still access your library.
[01:15:13.395 --> 01:15:14.356]  Oh, how nice of them.
[01:15:14.716 --> 01:15:16.617]  You pay for it, and then your thing's taken over.
[01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:20.580]  They're getting you used to... Remember the left got upset about Trump might do alerts over phones?
[01:15:20.841 --> 01:15:23.402]  We first exposed that with Obama when they were planning it.
[01:15:23.422 --> 01:15:24.263]  People didn't believe it.
[01:15:24.403 --> 01:15:25.304]  Oh, they'll never do that.
[01:15:26.064 --> 01:15:29.046]  This is government, but by corporations.
[01:15:30.049 --> 01:15:32.850]  They're more powerful than the government, and now you've got this device.
[01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:39.632]  They're watching you, they're spying on you, and this thing was meant from the beginning to control you, and track you, and trace you.
[01:15:40.572 --> 01:15:48.554]  And now they put on your screen, in steadfast support of the black voices that define music, creativity, and culture, we use ours.
[01:15:48.654 --> 01:15:52.075]  And then force screens all this kill the police stuff on there.
[01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:55.136]  Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Amazon, all unite.
[01:15:55.876 --> 01:15:59.038]  Well, Google and Apple own slave camps in China.
[01:15:59.418 --> 01:16:00.659]  They're mass murderers.
[01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:03.160]  It's all sick to destabilize the country.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.801]  These people are unbelievably disgusting.
[01:16:06.081 --> 01:16:10.804]  But this is big tech because Congress and everyone else lets them abuse us like this.
[01:16:11.424 --> 01:16:11.924]  Stay with us.
[01:16:13.725 --> 01:16:24.571]  By the way, while we've been covering the next phase of the globalist coup to overthrow the election in America once and for all, the Senate is having its hearings about
[01:16:25.745 --> 01:16:28.068]  The coup that went on three and a half years ago.
[01:16:29.289 --> 01:16:30.911]  So there's a lot of fireworks.
[01:16:30.971 --> 01:16:32.233]  Rosenstein's getting torn up.
[01:16:34.876 --> 01:16:41.585]  You noticed that the headline for today's show was Deep State 25th Amendment coup against the president now live.
[01:16:42.025 --> 01:16:43.227]  Oh, and what just happened minutes ago?
[01:16:45.785 --> 01:16:47.466]  What's now centering in the campaign?
[01:16:48.207 --> 01:16:50.949]  What's now centering on the ongoing operations to overthrow Trump?
[01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:52.671]  What's happening in the Senate?
[01:16:53.371 --> 01:16:56.054]  Rosenstein denies he suggested wearing a wire.
[01:16:57.115 --> 01:16:58.636]  Even though the witnesses say he did.
[01:16:58.916 --> 01:16:59.757]  And he admitted he did.
[01:17:00.017 --> 01:17:00.617]  Now it's a joke.
[01:17:01.138 --> 01:17:04.921]  Invoking 25th Amendment against Trump.
[01:17:06.082 --> 01:17:08.844]  So now he says he didn't really do that.
[01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:12.988]  And Ted Cruz has really torn into him.
[01:17:14.295 --> 01:17:31.259]  That's coming up in a moment, but I gotta tell you, the Secretary of Defense coming out, coming out and saying, oh, I don't agree with the Insurrection Act in a press conference, the Secretary of Defense isn't supposed to say he disagrees with the President.
[01:17:32.399 --> 01:17:37.920]  If he does that, he does that privately, and if the President and him have a disagreement, then he can resign.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:38.720]  You don't do that.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:42.241]  No one ever has done this before, but Trump puts up with it.
[01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:48.970]  And then he said, oh, I didn't know we were walking over to the church for a photo op.
[01:17:49.951 --> 01:17:51.572]  What do you think it is when you go over there?
[01:17:51.592 --> 01:17:52.693]  Of course there's going to be cameras.
[01:17:53.193 --> 01:17:55.134]  I thought we were just going over to talk to the troopers.
[01:17:55.354 --> 01:17:56.855]  Everything is to undermine the president.
[01:17:57.736 --> 01:17:59.417]  So these guys don't get attacked by the media.
[01:17:59.437 --> 01:18:01.698]  They're a bunch of cowards.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.641]  Pentagon chief turns on Trump.
[01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:08.282]  We've got that clip.
[01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:20.159]  So it's just at every level, these guys are signaling that they don't support the president.
[01:18:21.801 --> 01:18:30.871]  If this is an insurrection politically directed by the Democrats, and if we can't list Antifa as terrorists when they're trying to intimidate our speech and overthrow our election, then what can't we do?
[01:18:32.213 --> 01:18:32.974]  The answer is nothing.
[01:18:35.933 --> 01:18:38.694]  You got a bunch of weak-kneed Republicans, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:50.319]  This is the country under attack with people that are allied with the Communist Chinese, with big tech watching and tracking and censoring us, and taking control of our phones and computers, and shoveling Marxist propaganda at us, force-fed!
[01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:52.660]  You're already under martial law!
[01:18:53.851 --> 01:18:56.953]  The globalists are doing this because they see us as an insurrection.
[01:18:57.613 --> 01:19:00.455]  And they're teaching us that we are slaves.
[01:19:01.076 --> 01:19:06.039]  And it's going to go to a physical war if we don't admit it and get serious with these people.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:12.023]  Hills Court moles making Hillary Clinton testify on emails, that's good news.
[01:19:13.284 --> 01:19:14.204]  And a lot more is coming out.
[01:19:14.244 --> 01:19:17.887]  Here's Ted Cruz, Senator Cruz, going after
[01:19:19.206 --> 01:19:24.091]  The Howdy Doody doll, the ventriloquist doll that is Rosenstein.
[01:19:25.532 --> 01:19:40.867]  Let me ask you, did it strike you as strange, and my time has expired so I'm going to leave this as the last question, did it strike you as strange that the FBI and the Department of Justice was going after a three-star general, the incoming National Security Advisor to the President,
[01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:57.498]  Who they already said they were going to dismiss the case against, and their predicate for all of this is the Logan Act, which you know perfectly well is an unconstitutional law that no one has ever been prosecuted under in the history of the Department of Justice.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:03.704]  And should have been laughed out of the room in any responsible Department of Justice.
[01:20:04.747 --> 01:20:17.629]  If someone had suggested, we're going to go after the incoming National Security Advisor for violating the Logan Act, which says an American citizen can't talk to a foreign leader, I guarantee you today, right now, John Kerry is violating the Logan Act.
[01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:21.810]  Now, fortunately, it's an unconstitutional law, so who cares?
[01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:28.311]  Why did you not laugh this out of the room, and why didn't you get to answers on this?
[01:20:28.651 --> 01:20:32.392]  Why did you let this pile of partisan lies
[01:20:33.322 --> 01:20:34.563]  Consume the country for two years.
[01:20:34.603 --> 01:20:36.245]  Senator, I appreciate it.
[01:20:37.827 --> 01:20:38.968]  Because he's a criminal!
[01:20:40.389 --> 01:20:42.671]  Because these guys get away with murder!
[01:20:44.653 --> 01:20:50.639]  And they're a bunch of Ivy League lawyers that think they're above the law and absolutely have disdain, you know?
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.741]  Tucker Carlson hates Jared Kushner.
[01:20:54.984 --> 01:20:56.085]  Next segment we'll play a clip of that.
[01:20:58.148 --> 01:20:59.309]  And he finally took him to the woodshed.
[01:20:59.589 --> 01:21:03.291]  But let me tell you, behind the scenes, Tucker Carlson really hates Jared Kushner.
[01:21:04.371 --> 01:21:06.732]  And I've stayed out of it.
[01:21:07.753 --> 01:21:09.914]  But I will tell you, I know people that know Kushner.
[01:21:10.754 --> 01:21:14.236]  And I know people that know what's going on.
[01:21:14.276 --> 01:21:18.078]  And they literally make fun of Trump behind his back, just like McMaster did.
[01:21:18.418 --> 01:21:19.779]  And they are flaming liberals.
[01:21:21.929 --> 01:21:24.530]  And they literally have disdain for Trump's supporters.
[01:21:24.970 --> 01:21:30.792]  Trump really likes his supporters and really does cook his steaks burned and with ketchup and his blue collar in a weird way.
[01:21:31.652 --> 01:21:32.712]  That's what his parents came out of.
[01:21:33.172 --> 01:21:34.893]  But Kushner is trash.
[01:21:36.534 --> 01:21:37.654]  His dad's a scammer.
[01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:42.215]  They paid double the 666 building and the Chinese own it.
[01:21:42.495 --> 01:21:44.336]  Kushner is a problem.
[01:21:46.533 --> 01:22:05.345]  And I've talked to people about the way Kushner and his wife, Donald Trump's daughter, and they're just what my buddy calls space aliens, really rich, multi-generational money, the kids, the spoiled, rotten, snot noses, those that don't just run off and use drugs all day and surf, get into politics and things.
[01:22:05.365 --> 01:22:09.748]  They just walk around telling each other how elite they are and looking down their noses at people.
[01:22:09.788 --> 01:22:11.449]  They are elitist trash!
[01:22:14.650 --> 01:22:16.350]  Jared Kushner is trash.
[01:22:19.971 --> 01:22:21.572]  And he does not care about this country.
[01:22:23.792 --> 01:22:28.393]  And I am so sick of elitists that just because they're billionaires, look down on people.
[01:22:28.793 --> 01:22:37.935]  Let me tell you something, the Democratic Party is the most vapid, thin-skinned, fake group of elitist wannabe garbage you've ever been around.
[01:22:38.335 --> 01:22:40.476]  And Jared Kushner is just one of them.
[01:22:43.089 --> 01:22:45.071]  So I care about the President, but let me tell you something.
[01:22:45.331 --> 01:22:51.415]  The President has a blind spot, obviously, for his son-in-law.
[01:22:52.376 --> 01:22:55.899]  And they all are hedging their bets for Trump to be removed.
[01:22:58.441 --> 01:23:04.766]  And they're the reason Jared Kushner is in bed, probably physically with Tim Cook, and all the rest of them.
[01:23:06.909 --> 01:23:10.432]  And they're the so-called back channel, and they lie to Trump's face.
[01:23:11.073 --> 01:23:20.361]  And I'll tell you, Tucker Carlson doesn't know why Trump will take such abuse from people that are his enemies, and why he lets himself be surrounded by these damn enemies.
[01:23:22.363 --> 01:23:24.886]  I mean, Jared Kushner is just palpably evil.
[01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.552]  Now let's move on to something else here.
[01:23:36.744 --> 01:23:37.825]  Hundreds of witnesses.
[01:23:41.366 --> 01:23:42.387]  That's a Freudian slip.
[01:23:43.087 --> 01:23:43.887]  Witness to this evil.
[01:23:43.967 --> 01:23:48.109]  Hundreds of whites renounce privilege in white guilt prayer.
[01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:53.772]  And it's a bunch of old, dumb hippies and everybody out there with their stupid COVID cone of shames on.
[01:23:53.792 --> 01:23:57.554]  The video's up on Infowars.com.
[01:23:57.574 --> 01:23:58.914]  You can stomach looking at it.
[01:23:58.934 --> 01:23:59.855]  I'm about to play it.
[01:24:00.275 --> 01:24:02.056]  For radio listeners, though, you're lucky you're not seeing this.
[01:24:02.496 --> 01:24:03.336]  This doesn't look like hundreds.
[01:24:03.356 --> 01:24:04.597]  This looks like thousands.
[01:24:05.606 --> 01:24:08.148]  This looks like at least 2,000 people I see in the picture.
[01:24:10.689 --> 01:24:12.570]  Evangelical-style religious service.
[01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:17.073]  That's what I've been saying is, this white guilt and this hate America thing is the new religion.
[01:24:17.253 --> 01:24:25.959]  The left all got rid of Christianity and everything else, so now their religion is just hating themselves and running around lionizing any black person, period.
[01:24:26.739 --> 01:24:27.960]  It's disgusting, actually.
[01:24:29.581 --> 01:24:30.562]  Here, let's play these idiots.
[01:24:32.392 --> 01:24:35.233]  About racism, anti-blackness, or violence.
[01:24:35.794 --> 01:24:38.995]  About racism, anti-blackness, or violence.
[01:24:39.795 --> 01:24:42.657]  I will use my voice in the most uplifting way possible.
[01:24:42.897 --> 01:24:44.418]  I will use my voice in the most uplifting way possible.
[01:24:44.438 --> 01:24:47.899]  There's thousands of people being inducted into a cult.
[01:24:48.019 --> 01:24:51.041]  I will use my voice in my power to educate my community.
[01:24:51.141 --> 01:24:53.962]  I will use my voice in my power to educate my community.
[01:24:53.982 --> 01:24:57.104]  I will love my black neighbors the same as my white ones.
[01:24:57.124 --> 01:24:59.225]  I will love my black neighbors the same as my white ones.
[01:24:59.265 --> 01:24:59.925]  What does that even mean?
[01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:02.912]  Okay, so let's talk about this.
[01:25:03.733 --> 01:25:12.281]  I wonder if these white folks have any guilt for promoting the lawlessness and death that's killed hundreds and hundreds of people, including black retired police captain in St.
[01:25:12.321 --> 01:25:13.582]  Louis, David Dorn.
[01:25:13.802 --> 01:25:17.345]  Hey, let's see how he's doing, because they're not going to be having any prayer vigils for him.
[01:25:17.385 --> 01:25:17.686]  Here it is.
[01:25:20.935 --> 01:25:37.718]  There's a big article up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:38.959]  It'll only get out if you get it out.
[01:25:39.559 --> 01:25:46.360]  And it's a bunch of dead black police officers, federal and local, and just security guards, anybody else that got shot dead.
[01:25:47.984 --> 01:25:52.287]  By looters, and how the media won't even let you know their names.
[01:25:52.808 --> 01:25:59.232]  The article, Black Americans Killed in Riots Across American Cities, and you read most of them are police officers, federal and local.
[01:26:00.033 --> 01:26:14.144]  Shot dead, but you'll never hear their names, you'll never see them on the news, because, see, they don't fit the narrative that, oh, all these good black people are uprising against the white masters, like it's some big giant Quentin Tarantino movie.
[01:26:14.904 --> 01:26:16.065]  People go, oh that's just a movie.
[01:26:16.125 --> 01:26:16.285]  No.
[01:26:16.665 --> 01:26:18.466]  I know folks that know Rodriguez and this guy.
[01:26:18.486 --> 01:26:21.167]  They're paid money to put out movies to create race war.
[01:26:21.547 --> 01:26:23.628]  To keep blacks poor and to keep them bankrupted.
[01:26:24.148 --> 01:26:25.289]  It's sick and it's evil.
[01:26:25.429 --> 01:26:27.450]  The Democratic Party believes it owns black people.
[01:26:28.651 --> 01:26:30.271]  You ain't black if you don't vote for Joe Biden.
[01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:30.691]  Remember that?
[01:26:32.652 --> 01:26:33.793]  We got a lot more coming up.
[01:26:34.053 --> 01:26:34.573]  Stay with us.
[01:26:34.593 --> 01:26:35.814]  InfoWars.com.
[01:26:38.115 --> 01:26:38.795]  I'm exhausted.
[01:26:38.855 --> 01:26:39.916]  I'm not gonna lie to the listeners.
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:49.042]  And there was something about knowing the New World Order was evil, knowing it was bad, having all their documents, but then to just now be inside of it so bad.
[01:26:49.062 --> 01:26:52.763]  And to watch so many people just take a hook, line, and sinker.
[01:26:53.163 --> 01:26:58.425]  Like when you throw that line down right into the water, and you see that bass come up and hit that hook.
[01:27:01.406 --> 01:27:03.166]  And they're just reeling in those souls.
[01:27:04.627 --> 01:27:05.367]  Just laughing.
[01:27:07.007 --> 01:27:08.388]  And destroying civilization.
[01:27:09.414 --> 01:27:13.317]  And all these weird, evil, cynical senators.
[01:27:15.678 --> 01:27:17.179]  And man, when you go to D.C.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:23.444]  and you see a Republican senator, some of them have problems and are corrupt or whatever, but they don't have this aura.
[01:27:25.846 --> 01:27:28.207]  You'll feel a Democrat walk behind you.
[01:27:28.467 --> 01:27:29.288]  Like coldness.
[01:27:29.348 --> 01:27:30.649]  I mean, they're like devils.
[01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:33.851]  And they're all just these fake, evil lawyers.
[01:27:33.891 --> 01:27:34.432]  And they all just go.
[01:27:35.793 --> 01:27:37.554]  And they have their hands like a Palpatine.
[01:27:37.954 --> 01:27:38.975]  And they look at you.
[01:27:41.223 --> 01:27:43.244]  And they know you know they're dead inside.
[01:27:43.264 --> 01:27:49.308]  And they have this little smirk, though, that they're soulless and they're gonna get you.
[01:27:56.812 --> 01:27:59.494]  Since I mentioned I should have got to it days ago, it was a big sensation.
[01:27:59.594 --> 01:28:01.315]  Tucker Carlson finally started unloading.
[01:28:03.396 --> 01:28:04.477]  Jared Kushner, here it is.
[01:28:06.234 --> 01:28:07.634]  They've got to vote for us.
[01:28:08.335 --> 01:28:11.056]  Jared Kushner, for one, has made that point out loud.
[01:28:11.597 --> 01:28:17.560]  No one has more contempt for Donald Trump's voters than Jared Kushner does, and no one expresses it more frequently.
[01:28:18.781 --> 01:28:25.045]  In 2016, Donald Trump ran as a law and order candidate because he meant it, and his views remain fundamentally unchanged today.
[01:28:25.785 --> 01:28:34.651]  But the President's famously sharp instincts, the ones that won him the presidency almost four years ago, have been since subverted at every level by Jared Kushner.
[01:28:35.011 --> 01:28:39.354]  This is true on immigration, on foreign policy, and especially on law enforcement.
[01:28:40.055 --> 01:28:48.020]  As crime in this country continues to rise, Jared Kushner has led a highly aggressive effort to let more criminals out of prison and back onto the streets.
[01:28:48.901 --> 01:28:49.882]  This is reckless,
[01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:53.170]  At this moment in time, it's insane.
[01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:54.391]  It continues to happen.
[01:28:55.231 --> 01:28:56.792]  The President seems to sense this.
[01:28:57.433 --> 01:29:00.655]  At times, he seems aware he's being led in the wrong direction.
[01:29:00.695 --> 01:29:03.276]  He often derides Kushner as a liberal, and that's correct.
[01:29:03.316 --> 01:29:03.956]  Kushner is.
[01:29:04.557 --> 01:29:12.802]  But Kushner has convinced the President that throwing open the prisons is the key to winning African-American votes in the fall, and that those votes are essential to his re-election.
[01:29:13.622 --> 01:29:18.906]  Several times over the past few days, the President has signaled that he would very much like to crack down on rioters.
[01:29:18.966 --> 01:29:20.047]  That is his instinct.
[01:29:20.547 --> 01:29:21.908]  If you've watched him, you believe it.
[01:29:22.609 --> 01:29:28.133]  But every time, he has been talked out of it by Jared Kushner and by aides that Kushner has hired and controls.
[01:29:29.093 --> 01:29:32.496]  Kushner's assumption, apparently, is that African American voters like looting.
[01:29:33.396 --> 01:29:34.117]  That is wrong.
[01:29:34.898 --> 01:29:38.000]  Normal Americans of all colors hate looting.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.001]  Obviously.
[01:29:39.161 --> 01:29:40.502]  Why wouldn't they hate looting?
[01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:42.003]  They're decent people.
[01:29:43.834 --> 01:29:47.718]  So what are the lessons of all that we have seen and we've seen so much over the past five days?
[01:29:48.139 --> 01:29:50.641]  America is going to change because of this, that is certain.
[01:29:50.661 --> 01:29:51.682]  What can we learn from it?
[01:29:52.163 --> 01:29:53.845]  What should we demand going forward?
[01:29:54.625 --> 01:29:58.730]  The first thing to know is that we can no longer accept race-baiting from our leaders.
[01:29:59.210 --> 01:29:59.471]  Never.
[01:30:00.151 --> 01:30:04.696]  That has become so common now that we barely notice it, but it is dividing and destroying this country.
[01:30:04.756 --> 01:30:05.977]  We should make them stop.
[01:30:06.678 --> 01:30:07.038]  That's it.
[01:30:07.078 --> 01:30:08.939]  What Carlson said is key there.
[01:30:09.199 --> 01:30:09.920]  Very smart guy.
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:11.521]  Smartest person on TV.
[01:30:12.001 --> 01:30:14.102]  Now, number one, which shows you people are hungry for the truth.
[01:30:17.564 --> 01:30:22.046]  They get you used to the tyranny, where you adapt to accepting it.
[01:30:22.586 --> 01:30:34.773]  I mean, the stuff we put up with... They have Obama still runs the CIA publicly, and they have hearings saying I'm a Russian agent, and I don't get to face my accusers, and then they turn the CIA loose on me?
[01:30:36.038 --> 01:30:37.218]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[01:30:37.478 --> 01:30:38.299]  I'm pissed, man!
[01:30:38.319 --> 01:30:46.500]  A bunch of weird, chicken-necked, Ivy League jerks, who then are super racist against everybody.
[01:30:46.661 --> 01:30:53.682]  They just hate everybody, and they just love playing with us, like it's all big game, and everybody's getting poor and dying.
[01:30:54.922 --> 01:30:56.543]  Well, let me tell you something, Globalist.
[01:30:56.603 --> 01:30:58.743]  It's gonna be you that starts dying!
[01:30:59.724 --> 01:31:00.584]  Just like Hitler!
[01:31:01.344 --> 01:31:04.225]  We're not gonna put up with your crap forever, I guarantee you.
[01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:05.465]  I'm not... Listen.
[01:31:06.607 --> 01:31:08.268]  I know what's coming, and you don't have to worry about me.
[01:31:08.749 --> 01:31:10.550]  It's your own evil that's going to destroy you.
[01:31:10.991 --> 01:31:13.473]  You better back off now, you chicken neck devils!
[01:31:14.734 --> 01:31:19.138]  Well, Laura Loomer is one of the most banned people in the world on the internet.
[01:31:19.778 --> 01:31:20.799]  But hell, now it's everybody.
[01:31:20.839 --> 01:31:27.665]  Now they just come in and take over all your browsers, your iPhones, your droids, and push Marxist-Leninist, burn down America, white people are bad.
[01:31:27.685 --> 01:31:33.090]  And it's weirdo white people that own giant slave factories in China like Tim Cook.
[01:31:34.286 --> 01:31:37.769]  And Sergey Brin and Larry Page telling us this!
[01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:43.614]  Like if Jeffrey Dahmer came to your house and said, Don't eat beef!
[01:31:43.694 --> 01:31:44.614]  It's cannibalism!
[01:31:44.815 --> 01:31:46.976]  And he's got a person's arm in his hand he's eating!
[01:31:48.598 --> 01:31:48.798]  I mean...
[01:31:50.891 --> 01:31:59.656]  It's so fantastical how criminal Big Tech is and everything they've done and their disdain for us because they've gotten away with it for so long.
[01:31:59.676 --> 01:32:00.137]  But you know what?
[01:32:00.437 --> 01:32:01.638]  In some polls, she's leading.
[01:32:02.278 --> 01:32:04.339]  In other polls, she's neck and neck and that's exciting.
[01:32:04.359 --> 01:32:06.340]  Laura Loomer, ForCongress.com.
[01:32:06.781 --> 01:32:07.401]  And she joined us.
[01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:13.285]  She put out a huge report at Loomerd.com that I want to post on Infowars.com.
[01:32:13.345 --> 01:32:14.345]  I told them the other day to do this.
[01:32:14.425 --> 01:32:15.466]  I don't know what they did.
[01:32:15.706 --> 01:32:18.548]  Let's repost this giant report where she lays out the proof
[01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:34.375]  That Jack Dorsey is supporting this whole movement and is supporting Antifa, which is nothing but the little Batman uniforms that the academics and the communists put on when they go out and engage in their thuggery and intimidation.
[01:32:34.915 --> 01:32:37.056]  You know, Dan Dix is what I'd call a classical liberal.
[01:32:37.076 --> 01:32:37.777]  He's up in Canada.
[01:32:39.117 --> 01:32:43.639]  And he's just out there the other day in Vancouver and they start physically attacking him and the police say, yeah, you gotta go.
[01:32:43.659 --> 01:32:46.580]  And they go, oh, we've got a Nazi.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.501]  And then once they do that, he goes, well, what have I done that's Nazi?
[01:32:50.694 --> 01:32:51.734]  They go, we just don't like you.
[01:32:51.794 --> 01:32:52.415]  Start attacking him.
[01:32:52.655 --> 01:32:54.015]  These people are thugs.
[01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:56.917]  You look at the eyes of the people that are all attacking him.
[01:32:57.017 --> 01:32:58.697]  I mean, they are so dead.
[01:33:00.538 --> 01:33:01.939]  And they're just paid thugs.
[01:33:02.979 --> 01:33:03.759]  So she joins us.
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:09.722]  Laura Loomer calls on feds to raid Jack Dorsey's home and charge him for aiding and abetting terrorists.
[01:33:10.703 --> 01:33:13.986]  This guy does photo ops where he compares himself to Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:16.068]  I mean, what a jerk, man.
[01:33:16.208 --> 01:33:17.549]  What a fraud.
[01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:27.278]  Congressional candidate Laura Loomer, leader of the hashtag TWExit movement, encourages President Trump to go after these folks.
[01:33:28.059 --> 01:33:32.563]  Also, a Democratic Congresswoman thanks violent rioters in Florida.
[01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:34.745]  And of course, Loomer's saying he needs to get on parlor.
[01:33:35.795 --> 01:33:45.168]  Let's imagine if Trump did that and formed an exodus away, but he's being advised by Jared Kushner and Ivanka, who might as well just work for Hillary Clinton.
[01:33:45.488 --> 01:33:46.770]  Laura, good to have you on with us.
[01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:48.292]  So much crazy happening.
[01:33:48.552 --> 01:33:49.674]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:33:50.998 --> 01:33:52.619]  Yeah, thanks so much for having me, Alex.
[01:33:52.719 --> 01:33:56.982]  Well, I don't know where you want to start, but I guess we can start with Jack Dorsey.
[01:33:57.083 --> 01:34:13.535]  And one of the reasons why we're in this situation and why so much chaos and why these riots have become so violent is because Jack Dorsey, right, the head of Twitter, is allowing for this now designated terrorist organization to coordinate their riots across America and across the world.
[01:34:14.035 --> 01:34:14.536]  We're good to go.
[01:34:30.459 --> 01:34:33.020]  And just today, Michelle Malkin was suspended.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:44.362]  But now that President Trump's administration has officially designated Antifa as a terrorist organization, Jack Dorsey should be charged with aiding and abetting terrorist organizations.
[01:34:44.463 --> 01:34:54.245]  I've been saying this for years with regards to the Islamic terrorist activity that you see take place on Twitter, where you have conservatives banned and shut down for posting facts, but then Hamas
[01:34:54.825 --> 01:34:57.687]  ISIS, the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda.
[01:34:57.727 --> 01:34:59.969]  Okay, pick your choice of whichever terror org you want.
[01:35:00.009 --> 01:35:04.212]  Is there nothing that these big tech groups don't get away with?
[01:35:04.773 --> 01:35:08.115]  The average senator is like 80 years old, so they don't even know what the hell is going on.
[01:35:08.176 --> 01:35:11.058]  Oh, that little internet thing, that nobody uses that.
[01:35:11.418 --> 01:35:17.643]  It's like somebody that's running a horse stables in 1920 and going, nobody's ever going to use them cars.
[01:35:18.804 --> 01:35:21.526]  They literally let them take everything over.
[01:35:22.779 --> 01:35:28.386]  Yeah, and if you look at Twitter's bio, the official Twitter Twitter account, it says hashtag Black Lives Matter.
[01:35:28.787 --> 01:35:40.201]  So as one of the largest tech companies in the world, Twitter is now taking the position of these violent rioters and Antifa terrorists who are terrorizing American cities and really honestly trying to
[01:35:41.062 --> 01:35:44.945]  You know, cause so much chaos that they fatigue the nation ahead of an election.
[01:35:44.985 --> 01:35:45.625]  So that's it.
[01:35:45.665 --> 01:35:51.709]  That's why Apple funded it and Hollywood funded it and Jeff Bezos funded it because and Nike funds it.
[01:35:51.789 --> 01:35:54.310]  It's about breaking the country and demoralizing us.
[01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:55.451]  It's totally cold-blooded.
[01:35:55.871 --> 01:35:58.293]  These tech companies own slave factories.
[01:35:58.513 --> 01:36:01.014]  They should be up in front of Nuremberg trials.
[01:36:01.835 --> 01:36:04.997]  They shouldn't just be raided for censoring and working with foreign governments.
[01:36:05.277 --> 01:36:08.119]  They should be arrested for working with Xi Jinping.
[01:36:09.235 --> 01:36:23.747]  Right, and as you see, we're still in the middle of this COVID pandemic and these quarantine lockdowns, and all of these big tech companies have told their employees, most of them who are foreigners from hostile nations like China and Saudi Arabia, that they can work from home.
[01:36:24.047 --> 01:36:36.418]  And so while Americans are stuck inside and their businesses are failing because they can't go to work, and while Antifa is burning America down all across the country— That's right, we're told, still stay in your houses, but the commies, they can run around and burn everything!
[01:36:37.148 --> 01:36:49.722]  Yeah, and you have these foreigners who are on H-1B visas working for Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg silencing Americans who are in quarantine in their homes trying to peacefully speak out about this insanity that is taking place in our country.
[01:36:50.122 --> 01:36:52.225]  And so, this really is a war, okay?
[01:36:52.325 --> 01:36:56.850]  I would say that by putting that in his bio, Jack Dorsey has officially declared war
[01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.670]  I'm good.
[01:37:11.710 --> 01:37:19.378]  And so I really do believe that for the sake of curbing this terrorist activity, Jack Dorsey ought to be rated.
[01:37:19.678 --> 01:37:20.599]  Twitter ought to be rated.
[01:37:20.719 --> 01:37:21.680]  Facebook ought to be rated.
[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:29.708]  And these executives need to be charged with aiding and abetting terrorist organizations in the middle of an active insurrection against the United States of America.
[01:37:29.768 --> 01:37:30.869]  Because that is what this is.
[01:37:30.909 --> 01:37:34.092]  This is a coup, and this is just the Democrats' recent attempt
[01:37:34.465 --> 01:37:48.993]  To try to influence the elections and create so much disruption that even conservatives, that they want even conservatives and Republicans to be so fatigued with what is happening in their country that they just, you know, wave the white flag of surrender and say, you know what?
[01:37:49.433 --> 01:37:50.394]  Alright, I give in.
[01:37:50.614 --> 01:37:51.014]  I give in.
[01:37:51.034 --> 01:37:52.435]  Laura, you're absolutely right.
[01:37:52.495 --> 01:37:53.736]  What does Trump need to do?
[01:37:53.796 --> 01:38:02.561]  I mean, even his own Secretary of Defense is up there saying, oh no, we don't need the Insurrection Act, when if this isn't a foreign-funded insurrection, I don't know what is.
[01:38:03.807 --> 01:38:10.551]  I do believe that President Trump just needs to go ahead and implement the Insurrection Act, and he warned the other day these governors.
[01:38:10.611 --> 01:38:15.153]  And look, it's not his fault because these governors are refusing to call in the National Guard.
[01:38:15.193 --> 01:38:21.416]  In order for the federal government to send in the National Guard, you have to have a formal request from the state's governors.
[01:38:21.716 --> 01:38:29.340]  Yet these Democrat governors and officials would rather have their cities be burned down and American citizens terrorized for the sake of making Trump look bad.
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:31.603]  And look how slimy Northam looks.
[01:38:31.643 --> 01:38:33.885]  I mean, he doesn't just keep babies alive and sell their body parts.
[01:38:34.226 --> 01:38:38.531]  I mean, these all people just look like classic con men out of a movie.
[01:38:38.591 --> 01:38:41.634]  I mean, that guy could be a con man in the movie Casino or something.
[01:38:41.875 --> 01:38:44.277]  He looks slimier than... Sorry, go ahead.
[01:38:45.211 --> 01:38:46.571]  Think of the hypocrisy, Alex.
[01:38:46.611 --> 01:38:54.154]  Here you have somebody like Northam talking about how he's not going to call in the National Guard and how these are riots for the sake of race relations.
[01:38:54.214 --> 01:38:58.215]  This is a guy who got caught in blackface or a KKK hood.
[01:38:58.535 --> 01:39:01.456]  I personally think he's the guy in the hood, not the blackface.
[01:39:01.696 --> 01:39:03.497]  He is a full-blown racist.
[01:39:03.817 --> 01:39:14.160]  So how are these Democrats going to accuse President Trump and Republicans of being racist when they themselves are taking photos in blackface and KKK hoods?
[01:39:14.833 --> 01:39:17.154]  I mean, where is the media to report on this?
[01:39:17.515 --> 01:39:22.757]  Oh, that's right, the media has decided to play hand-in-hand with the radical left and their insurrection in this country.
[01:39:23.118 --> 01:39:29.141]  And that's why they decided to ban people like me and you, because we were reaching millions of people and exposing these leftists.
[01:39:29.702 --> 01:39:35.285]  Uh, you know, for the racist, uh, for the, uh, domestic terrorists that they really are.
[01:39:35.365 --> 01:39:36.246]  Let me ask you this.
[01:39:36.486 --> 01:39:39.728]  Obviously the Joker, all that they admit was to trigger this for the election.
[01:39:39.748 --> 01:39:40.948]  They admitted that was the plan.
[01:39:41.349 --> 01:39:43.430]  Glorifying, killing random people, killing police.
[01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:45.891]  What do you expect them to pull next?
[01:39:45.951 --> 01:39:51.094]  I mean, already the COVID hoax and now this, I mean, it's just a barrel of snakes here.
[01:39:52.176 --> 01:39:59.800]  Well, that's the thing, right, is what you've seen from the beginning of 2020 is disturbance after disturbance after disturbance and disruption, okay?
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:11.486]  So you have COVID, and then you have these riots, and then you have this push for mail-in voting, and they just want there to be so much instability, and you're right, who knows what's gonna be next, right?
[01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:14.447]  And shouldn't we be reopening our nation now?
[01:40:14.507 --> 01:40:19.970]  Shouldn't Americans be able to get back to life and all these COVID-19 Chinese virus restrictions be lifted?
[01:40:20.691 --> 01:40:31.663]  How is it that Jews and Christians are being threatened in New York City with arrests, but Bill de Blasio's daughter is allowed to go outside and throw things at police officers and obstruct traffic and participate in riots that are getting cops killed?
[01:40:32.063 --> 01:40:36.168]  I would love to know because it just seems like there not only is a full-blown war on
[01:40:36.795 --> 01:40:41.677]  Full-blown war on President Trump's administration and conservative values and religious Americans.
[01:40:41.737 --> 01:40:44.418]  But, you know, there's a war on God in this country.
[01:40:44.698 --> 01:40:51.640]  You have people in this country, Democrats, who are more offended by seeing President Trump take a photo with a Bible in D.C.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.321]  than they are of the fact that- No, you're right.
[01:40:53.681 --> 01:40:54.861]  This is good versus evil.
[01:40:54.881 --> 01:40:55.782]  Laura Loomer, stay there.
[01:40:55.822 --> 01:40:57.102]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:40:57.142 --> 01:40:58.323]  Newswars.com.
[01:40:59.563 --> 01:41:02.364]  I was the first male case that they chose.
[01:41:03.324 --> 01:41:04.685]  Laura Loomer was the first female.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:07.102]  First they start with the demonization.
[01:41:09.524 --> 01:41:21.918]  So that when they totally censor you and do things to control your life that only go on in communist China, other people don't stand up for you and then the precedent's set.
[01:41:22.992 --> 01:41:24.913]  She got banned from using Uber.
[01:41:24.953 --> 01:41:28.434]  She got banned from using the Airbnb.
[01:41:28.474 --> 01:41:29.734]  She got banned from hotels.
[01:41:29.794 --> 01:41:31.335]  She got banned from everything.
[01:41:32.075 --> 01:41:34.736]  And now we learned that that's the model for everybody.
[01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:40.418]  Oh, and Drew Brees came out and said he thinks we should all unify and be one nation.
[01:41:40.698 --> 01:41:41.638]  So he's getting canceled.
[01:41:42.299 --> 01:41:43.279]  This is terrorism.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:48.181]  An NBA announcer came out and said all lives matter.
[01:41:48.361 --> 01:41:48.961]  He got fired.
[01:41:50.956 --> 01:41:54.418]  Everybody else, they get their speech, as long as you parrot what the establishment says.
[01:41:54.438 --> 01:42:03.345]  It has nothing to do with liking black people, or wanting a future, or not saying it looks like what happened to Mr. Floyd was wrong.
[01:42:04.045 --> 01:42:06.667]  It's about doing what the system says when they say it.
[01:42:07.027 --> 01:42:09.929]  They're just using race relations as an excuse to make you bow.
[01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:20.077]  Laura, what was it like for you to see Blackout Tuesday, where Apple, Google, YouTube, Facebook, all of them unified Spotify,
[01:42:21.232 --> 01:42:29.576]  And all only forced 1980s radical leftist liberation music, you know, F the police, kill the police, gangster rap.
[01:42:30.356 --> 01:42:31.076]  Forcing that.
[01:42:31.216 --> 01:42:32.937]  Some services wouldn't even let people get to their music.
[01:42:33.377 --> 01:42:35.038]  They were just like, you're gonna get this now.
[01:42:36.199 --> 01:42:41.101]  Not just surveilling us, not just social credit score, but now force feeding us.
[01:42:41.501 --> 01:42:43.382]  People are upset about alerts from Trump.
[01:42:44.269 --> 01:42:44.890]  On their phones.
[01:42:45.611 --> 01:42:46.732]  So the White House won't do them.
[01:42:47.113 --> 01:42:48.915]  But, but, because that is kind of fascist.
[01:42:49.315 --> 01:42:57.886]  This is an alert from big tech, whether you like it or not, forcing its way into your life out of some dystopic nightmare scenario, Laura.
[01:42:59.062 --> 01:43:01.303]  Yeah, look, it should honestly terrify everybody.
[01:43:01.423 --> 01:43:18.772]  And when you look at what they're trying to do and their surveillance capabilities, and now they're trying to force people, Black Lives Matter and Antifa terrorist propaganda, it makes you wonder if they would even potentially aid and facilitate in the hunting down and tracking of certain undesirable individuals.
[01:43:19.052 --> 01:43:23.014]  For example, and before some people say this is too far-fetched, right?
[01:43:23.416 --> 01:43:36.060]  I used to think it would be too far-fetched for, you know, phones to be tracking people and then, you know, giving away your private medical information and people being banned and then Facebook saying that it was okay to kill certain people like me and you.
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:38.801]  But here we are in 2020 and this is all happening.
[01:43:39.261 --> 01:43:51.550]  What's to say that these companies aren't going to start pinpointing people's locations, like my location, your location, Gavin McInnes' location, Milo's location, or, you know, the location of people who have been banned and deemed dangerous.
[01:43:51.570 --> 01:43:55.213]  Stop there, because Twitter admittedly shares it with hundreds of other big tech companies.
[01:43:55.273 --> 01:43:56.353]  Netflix shares everything.
[01:43:57.314 --> 01:43:58.135]  This isn't far-fetched.
[01:43:58.695 --> 01:44:01.097]  It came out that Antifa was in the FBI.
[01:44:01.157 --> 01:44:02.698]  It came out Antifa was in Twitter.
[01:44:02.998 --> 01:44:05.240]  It came out that they have actually been doing all this.
[01:44:05.964 --> 01:44:10.648]  Yeah, and we know that there are members of Antifa who work for these different companies.
[01:44:10.728 --> 01:44:12.510]  It's been exposed in this last week.
[01:44:12.570 --> 01:44:28.584]  We see how the executives and the people who have access to billions of people's personal information and their location because these apps directly tied to your location on your phone, they have access and these are the same people who are participating in BLM and Antifa activities or, you know, acts of
[01:44:29.324 --> 01:44:36.166]  You know, communication with Islamic terrorist organizations, as we know in my case, where CARE privately lobbied Twitter to ban me.
[01:44:36.426 --> 01:44:42.788]  And so this is now a serious community public safety issue, especially for conservatives.
[01:44:43.108 --> 01:44:51.311]  And they are trying to whip people up into a frenzy to start violently attacking innocent people based off the color of their skin in the streets.
[01:44:51.651 --> 01:45:05.241]  And we have seen this in video footage that has come out over the last few days that the mainstream media is refusing to report on where you have some white individuals walking down the street getting attacked by by black mobs, right?
[01:45:05.521 --> 01:45:09.124]  And people cheering on and not doing anything about it.
[01:45:09.224 --> 01:45:12.867]  And so I find it to be very concerning.
[01:45:13.147 --> 01:45:17.010]  And people who are, you know, conservative,
[01:45:17.563 --> 01:45:24.425]  Especially should be very worried and especially if you are a conservative public figure who has been demonized by these tech companies.
[01:45:24.445 --> 01:45:27.946]  I was speaking to one of them today.
[01:45:27.966 --> 01:45:38.249]  I was talking to Milo and Milo told me that he is not going to be leaving his house anytime soon over the next week as long as these riots continue because he's worried about his safety.
[01:45:38.269 --> 01:45:40.990]  You know, so this is this is really scary.
[01:45:43.393 --> 01:45:44.774]  And look what they did to you, Alex.
[01:45:44.934 --> 01:45:50.799]  You know, they perpetuated this hoax that an InfoWars crew set a homeless man's belongings on fire.
[01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:54.262]  You know, they're trying to incite violence against you in the InfoWars studio.
[01:45:54.282 --> 01:45:55.703]  Well, I was about to bring that up next.
[01:45:56.324 --> 01:45:57.144]  But it's not just us.
[01:45:57.725 --> 01:46:00.567]  They're all over the news saying there's no anti-violence.
[01:46:01.048 --> 01:46:04.671]  It's right-wingers staging it and blaming us when they're calling for the violence.
[01:46:04.931 --> 01:46:05.852]  It's just crazy.
[01:46:06.724 --> 01:46:20.436]  Yeah, they're starting to, in Minnesota, Keith Ellison, who I spent years, mind you, let's just stop for a second, because don't you find it really interesting how conservatives want to pretend like this revelation of Keith Ellison being tied to Antifa is new?
[01:46:20.816 --> 01:46:28.483]  I remember two years ago, Alex, when I was on the ground exposing Ilhan Omar and Keith Ellison for being tied to Antifa, being tied to ISIS, two years ago!
[01:46:28.883 --> 01:46:32.265]  And what if people say, oh, Laura, come on, it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:46:32.305 --> 01:46:33.325]  Come on, you can't say that.
[01:46:33.345 --> 01:46:35.746]  We're not going to report on it because it's too incendiary.
[01:46:36.027 --> 01:46:36.907]  But now what do you see?
[01:46:36.987 --> 01:46:40.749]  Everybody's trying to act as if this is some grand revelation.
[01:46:40.769 --> 01:46:44.251]  And that's what's frustrating is we don't want to be the ones that break it to get the credit.
[01:46:44.351 --> 01:46:45.531]  I just want to beat these people.
[01:46:45.571 --> 01:46:52.975]  But yeah, that's why they had to try to suppress you and myself and others, because we were exposing all this many years ago, exactly as it was.
[01:46:53.255 --> 01:46:57.517]  You were in Congress begging Trump and getting arrested to just do something
[01:46:57.717 --> 01:47:06.207]  And we warned about it.
[01:47:06.307 --> 01:47:07.629]  And I was sitting right next to you.
[01:47:07.649 --> 01:47:11.213]  I was sitting next to you and I remember I said they're trying to steal the election.
[01:47:11.273 --> 01:47:12.275]  You can play the video.
[01:47:12.315 --> 01:47:13.096]  You can roll it back.
[01:47:13.176 --> 01:47:15.719]  Two years ago I said they're going to try to steal the 2018 and 2020 elections.
[01:47:17.537 --> 01:47:18.939]  So that that's what's happening.
[01:47:18.979 --> 01:47:23.023]  So everything there's a reason why we're banned and it's not because we're offensive.
[01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:24.485]  It's not because we're hateful.
[01:47:24.565 --> 01:47:37.459]  It's not because we're racist like they want to say it's because we are effective and we are effective in countering their messaging and we we we more so than anybody else people like me and you and Milo and Gavin.
[01:47:39.801 --> 01:47:50.050]  And by the way, Trump four years ago knew that and adopted a lot of our nationalist patriot rhetoric.
[01:47:50.231 --> 01:47:51.672]  That's just a reality base.
[01:47:51.712 --> 01:47:53.333]  It's not some theory we cooked up.
[01:47:53.393 --> 01:47:54.034]  It's just common sense.
[01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:58.999]  What does Trump need to do now, Laura, with 152 days left to turn the tide?
[01:47:59.019 --> 01:48:02.222]  Because I'm telling you, they're going to steal this election right now if Trump doesn't get serious.
[01:48:03.697 --> 01:48:08.461]  Yeah, well, look, like I said in the beginning, Insurrection Act right away.
[01:48:08.901 --> 01:48:28.638]  And on top of that, I do believe that these tech executives need to be raided and charged criminally for aiding and abetting terrorist organizations because they are allowing for their sites, which are wrongfully being called platforms, they should be immediately... I guarantee you, if you or I were coordinating 50 people to go burn things or shoot people, we'd be arrested and we should be.
[01:48:28.878 --> 01:48:31.000]  These people are just everywhere coordinating it.
[01:48:32.512 --> 01:48:40.716]  Yeah, and Jack Dorsey is actively endorsing it by putting hashtag Black Lives Matter in the Twitter bio and refusing to ban Antifa accounts, you know?
[01:48:41.097 --> 01:48:43.778]  So they're banning people who are speaking out against violence.
[01:48:44.138 --> 01:48:48.781]  And mind you, it's not conservatives who are committing these acts of violence and looting and rioting, right?
[01:48:48.821 --> 01:48:49.641]  These are leftists.
[01:48:49.701 --> 01:48:50.822]  These are radical leftists.
[01:48:50.842 --> 01:48:52.663]  These are Antifa domestic terrorists.
[01:48:54.024 --> 01:48:55.885]  You know, that's what I would do immediately.
[01:48:55.965 --> 01:49:03.452]  Insurrection Act, and then have, you know, AG Barr's Justice Department charge and prosecute the tech executives.
[01:49:03.592 --> 01:49:06.034]  All they gotta do is indict the heads of Antifa.
[01:49:06.054 --> 01:49:08.036]  We even know who the Rise Up Group leaders are.
[01:49:08.056 --> 01:49:09.197]  They're a bunch of Marxist Leninists.
[01:49:09.577 --> 01:49:12.440]  Indict them, get their documents, and it all goes right back to the DNC.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:13.000]  We have them.
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.962]  George Soros, Alexander Soros.
[01:49:17.079 --> 01:49:26.045]  Right, and also, too, before it's too late, I've been calling on President Trump and other Republicans to get on to parlor because the next step is just banning President Trump.
[01:49:26.385 --> 01:49:28.406]  And I've been warning about this for two years, Alex.
[01:49:28.466 --> 01:49:34.170]  I said, they're going to censor the president, they're going to ban President Trump, they're going to shut down Republican officials.
[01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:36.431]  Let's talk about what's coming next with Laura Loomer.
[01:49:36.451 --> 01:49:36.872]  Stay with us.
[01:49:38.971 --> 01:49:47.335]  The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.
[01:49:48.576 --> 01:49:50.817]  We are not in one of those situations now.
[01:49:51.938 --> 01:49:54.299]  I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.
[01:49:56.744 --> 01:49:58.205]  I did know that we were going to the church.
[01:49:58.345 --> 01:50:00.166]  I was not aware of a photo op was happening.
[01:50:00.566 --> 01:50:03.688]  Of course, the president drags a large press pool along with him.
[01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:10.913]  Look, I do everything I can to try to stay apolitical and to try and stay out of situations that may appear political.
[01:50:11.433 --> 01:50:15.676]  And sometimes I'm successful at doing that, and sometimes I'm not as successful.
[01:50:15.716 --> 01:50:19.478]  But my aim is to keep the department out of politics, to stay apolitical.
[01:50:19.899 --> 01:50:21.480]  And that's what I continue to try and do.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:24.301]  So the whole media just attacks everything.
[01:50:25.442 --> 01:50:31.847]  Everything that Trump does and that everybody just grovels and hopes they'll be nice.
[01:50:32.328 --> 01:50:33.088]  Oh, I'm not with Trump.
[01:50:33.168 --> 01:50:34.650]  Oh, I'm not political.
[01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:36.051]  All of this is political.
[01:50:36.091 --> 01:50:36.991]  Laura Loomer is our guest.
[01:50:37.492 --> 01:50:38.212]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:38.232 --> 01:50:41.255]  Thank you for joining us on this Live Wednesday Worldwide Transmission.
[01:50:41.835 --> 01:50:48.401]  Laura, I've got a lot of points I want to go to and a lot of other videos I want to talk about with you, but you're running for Congress.
[01:50:48.441 --> 01:50:53.525]  Tell us where you're running for folks that may not know and just how important this upcoming election year is.
[01:50:55.111 --> 01:50:55.351]  Great.
[01:50:55.411 --> 01:50:55.972]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:50:55.992 --> 01:51:04.798]  Yeah, so I'm running for Congress in Florida's 21st Congressional District and, you know, that happens to be the home voting district of President Trump and Mrs. Trump.
[01:51:04.838 --> 01:51:07.440]  And so on Election Day, President Trump will be voting for me.
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:12.703]  And when I win, I will be representing the people of District 21, including President Trump and Mrs. Trump.
[01:51:13.063 --> 01:51:17.967]  And so really, what you're seeing right now in our country is the fight to save America.
[01:51:18.247 --> 01:51:21.009]  So this election, and it may sound cliche, but
[01:51:21.389 --> 01:51:25.232]  You know, it needs to be said and people really need to drill this into their mind.
[01:51:25.652 --> 01:51:28.654]  This is an election of life versus death.
[01:51:28.994 --> 01:51:38.221]  This is an election in which the survival of America or the infinite death of our constitutional republic stands.
[01:51:38.601 --> 01:51:43.985]  And so, you need to vote like your life depends on it because you see what's happening in the street right now?
[01:51:44.085 --> 01:51:46.967]  This is America under Democrat control.
[01:51:47.007 --> 01:51:50.369]  This is what America looks like if Democrats get the White House, you guys.
[01:51:50.768 --> 01:51:55.415]  If Republicans do not take back the House, you know, this is going to become the norm.
[01:51:55.716 --> 01:51:57.699]  This is going to become the normal in America.
[01:51:57.759 --> 01:52:03.447]  And you see the way that these power-hungry Democrats are now utilizing this crisis.
[01:52:03.487 --> 01:52:05.110]  They never let a crisis go to waste.
[01:52:05.490 --> 01:52:05.750]  I don't
[01:52:25.276 --> 01:52:28.578]  Oh, they all jump on the bandwagon to grovel to the media.
[01:52:28.818 --> 01:52:34.722]  And Big Tech is leveraging the youth now, totally weaponizing social media against Americans.
[01:52:34.962 --> 01:52:40.665]  I mean, this is just like the CIA would use Facebook and Twitter to overthrow countries and fund the Arab Spring that was so bad.
[01:52:40.885 --> 01:52:41.986]  They're doing that here.
[01:52:42.286 --> 01:52:43.767]  They're literally muscling us.
[01:52:44.087 --> 01:52:48.190]  So it's not like some liberal thing Jack Dorsey's doing or some liberal thing Tim Cook's doing.
[01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:49.811]  These are monstrous people.
[01:52:50.970 --> 01:52:57.395]  Yeah, and you know, the woman who I'm running against, Congresswoman Lois Frankel, she took to Twitter to thank the rioters, okay?
[01:52:57.415 --> 01:52:59.176]  So she said that it was peaceful.
[01:52:59.696 --> 01:53:00.457]  What is peaceful?
[01:53:00.497 --> 01:53:02.879]  You know, I got stuck on I-95, Alex.
[01:53:03.039 --> 01:53:12.926]  I was driving to a campaign meeting the other day and I got stuck on I-95 because rioters, BML rioters and Antifa rioters decided to shut down traffic in both directions.
[01:53:12.986 --> 01:53:14.727]  What exactly about that is peaceful?
[01:53:15.047 --> 01:53:19.791]  What exactly is peaceful about shots being fired at the Palm Beach outlets and people having to throw
[01:53:20.191 --> 01:53:21.593]  We're good to go.
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:37.621]  It's peaceful.
[01:53:37.901 --> 01:53:41.183]  These people tried to cross over the bridge into Mar-a-Lago.
[01:53:41.223 --> 01:53:44.566]  They tried to trespass to go destroy President Trump's Mar-a-Lago.
[01:53:44.986 --> 01:53:56.936]  So, you know, along with Lois Frankel, I haven't seen a single Democrat in this country who's in a position of power, and any elected official in the Democrat Party who has condemned this.
[01:53:57.256 --> 01:53:57.917]  No, you're right.
[01:53:58.377 --> 01:54:06.965]  Let me show you this video, because a lot of police officers have been killed, a lot of security people have been killed, federal security's been killed, and the media won't even ever say their names.
[01:54:06.985 --> 01:54:09.807]  You've got to dig and dig days later to even find out who they are.
[01:54:09.867 --> 01:54:13.791]  There'll be videos of them getting shot and killed, and the national news won't show it.
[01:54:14.591 --> 01:54:23.079]  Twitter and Facebook try to block it, but oh, they show you anything that can then be projected onto the police in general to, again, undermine the country.
[01:54:23.119 --> 01:54:23.719]  Here's Captain
[01:54:24.619 --> 01:54:33.229]  Police Captain David Dorn, retired, 77 years old, hired to protect a pawn shop, and he was shot in the chest for trying to stop looters.
[01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:35.612]  Does this black life matter?
[01:54:35.892 --> 01:54:36.373]  Here's the video.
[01:54:41.303 --> 01:54:42.764]  Oh some TV's cuz!
[01:54:43.464 --> 01:54:45.184]  OG man rest in peace bro.
[01:54:45.905 --> 01:54:46.965]  It's nothing but love bro.
[01:54:47.585 --> 01:54:48.365]  You good bro.
[01:54:48.886 --> 01:54:49.746]  It's okay bro.
[01:54:50.346 --> 01:54:51.286]  Just relax bro.
[01:54:51.847 --> 01:54:52.627]  Relax bro.
[01:54:53.267 --> 01:54:54.047]  Relax bro.
[01:54:55.348 --> 01:54:56.088]  Oh some TV's.
[01:54:56.148 --> 01:54:57.048]  He was doing the right thing.
[01:54:57.869 --> 01:54:58.749]  He was doing the right old thing.
[01:54:58.769 --> 01:55:00.730]  He was trying to protect it but at the same time it's the wrong.
[01:55:01.230 --> 01:55:02.970]  It's too much going on for that OG.
[01:55:03.010 --> 01:55:03.651]  Come on OG.
[01:55:03.671 --> 01:55:04.631]  We better than that OG.
[01:55:06.653 --> 01:55:08.134]  I think he do work here, man.
[01:55:08.695 --> 01:55:09.696]  He work here, man.
[01:55:10.517 --> 01:55:12.439]  I was some f****** TVs, man.
[01:55:13.259 --> 01:55:13.840]  I was some TVs.
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:14.721]  He lost his life.
[01:55:14.761 --> 01:55:16.002]  I was some TVs, cuz.
[01:55:16.863 --> 01:55:18.384]  I was some TVs, cuz.
[01:55:20.249 --> 01:55:41.014]  When the communists take over they didn't always make whatever group was in power bow down and pray and ask for forgiveness and now they're doing an all-along race the opposite again of what Martin Luther King talked about this is so diabolical this is so planned this is so evil and the Democrats need to pay for what they've done now juxtapose that video with this new video that just went up on InfoWars.com
[01:55:42.282 --> 01:55:56.165]  Antiva Soyboy mocked for crying hysterically as Pierre unnecessarily applies a tourniquet to a tiny scratch on his leg and then it turns out
[01:55:57.762 --> 01:56:03.685]  He was just crying for attention, and it turns out this video just resurfaced.
[01:56:03.705 --> 01:56:06.747]  This was when Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race.
[01:56:06.807 --> 01:56:10.789]  So, this is the hysteria of Antifa, how they all are these big heroes.
[01:56:10.829 --> 01:56:11.170]  Here it is.
[01:56:21.275 --> 01:56:24.576]  I know, I know, I know, I know.
[01:56:25.357 --> 01:56:25.957]  Look, it's fake.
[01:56:25.997 --> 01:56:29.118]  We're just doing this for hysteria.
[01:56:29.158 --> 01:56:33.400]  Because they're all failed theater majors.
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.701]  I'm telling you, almost all leftists on the street are failed theater majors.
[01:56:40.083 --> 01:56:41.123]  Breathe, breathe.
[01:56:41.683 --> 01:56:43.484]  We got the tourniquet on here.
[01:56:44.784 --> 01:56:46.785]  And it looks like it's a fake strawberry.
[01:56:46.865 --> 01:56:47.666]  A raspberry.
[01:56:49.946 --> 01:56:50.927]  You're good, you're good.
[01:56:50.967 --> 01:56:53.909]  You're a survivor of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.
[01:56:54.289 --> 01:56:55.950]  You fought the Nazis in Spain.
[01:56:59.413 --> 01:57:00.113]  Just fake crying.
[01:57:03.176 --> 01:57:07.619]  Andy Vasoiboi mocked for crying hysterically as Pierre unnecessarily applies tourniquet.
[01:57:08.199 --> 01:57:10.161]  I mean, what's up with the LARPing with these people?
[01:57:12.230 --> 01:57:15.774]  Look, it seems to be just one giant psyop, doesn't it?
[01:57:15.854 --> 01:57:21.841]  I mean, we're being told that it's right-wingers who are perpetuating violence, okay?
[01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:27.127]  They are telling us that Black Lives Matter while they refuse to speak out about an innocent
[01:57:27.247 --> 01:57:28.288]  We're good to go.
[01:57:43.417 --> 01:57:47.000]  And all these other elected officials tweeting out, you know, materials.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:50.723]  I mean, these people should be removed from office, okay?
[01:57:50.743 --> 01:57:52.064]  This isn't just Antifa.
[01:57:52.384 --> 01:58:01.771]  You have Democrat members of Congress, Democrat mayors like Bill de Blasio, Democrat governors now trying to aid in this because this is an insurrection.
[01:58:02.253 --> 01:58:04.094]  This is an insurrection, Alex.
[01:58:04.494 --> 01:58:05.874]  This is what they are doing.
[01:58:05.894 --> 01:58:09.435]  Okay, this has nothing to do with race relations right now.
[01:58:09.455 --> 01:58:10.676]  That's right, and now this has happened.
[01:58:10.896 --> 01:58:12.276]  They admitted to attempted overthrow.
[01:58:12.616 --> 01:58:15.197]  Twitter suspends Michelle Malkin amid leftist violence.
[01:58:17.538 --> 01:58:24.760]  Despite Trump's call to stop the censorship, because she said violent criminal looters should be shot, they've now suspended her.
[01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:29.101]  Sorry, Laura, go ahead.
[01:58:30.802 --> 01:58:30.982]  Right.
[01:58:31.062 --> 01:58:47.475]  And so you have celebrities who are talking about stabbing people in the neck and talking about burning it down and putting America in flames and talking about, you know, if you go online, there's countless assassination threats against the president, something you've been talking about for years.
[01:58:47.795 --> 01:58:50.317]  So how is that acceptable to post on Twitter?
[01:58:50.357 --> 01:58:53.299]  But then Michelle Malkin gets banned for her comments, right?
[01:58:53.579 --> 01:58:57.983]  This is what I mean about these tech executives now aiding and abetting terrorist activity.
[01:58:58.363 --> 01:59:05.424]  They need to immediately, they need to immediately charge these tech executives with aiding and abetting terrorist organizations.
[01:59:05.584 --> 01:59:11.005]  And really, honestly, I do believe that people like Dorsey and Zuckerberg ought to be charged with treason because they are aiding.
[01:59:11.025 --> 01:59:11.846]  That's right.
[01:59:12.166 --> 01:59:14.146]  Laura Loomer for Congress.com.
[01:59:14.186 --> 01:59:14.986]  Thank you so much, Laura.
[01:59:15.006 --> 01:59:15.726]  We really appreciate you.
[01:59:16.046 --> 01:59:16.767]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:59:16.787 --> 01:59:17.447]  We've got a lot coming up.
[01:59:17.627 --> 01:59:18.907]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:18.947 --> 01:59:20.047]  John Iverport coming up.
[01:59:21.988 --> 01:59:22.868]  He's been on fire lately.
[01:59:22.908 --> 01:59:23.628]  Really pissed off.
[01:59:23.648 --> 01:59:24.088]  He should be.
[01:59:25.421 --> 01:59:27.341]  We're all in the middle of a big social experiment.
[01:59:27.661 --> 01:59:34.483]  They're breaking the social contract to politically totally take the country over and loot the living snot out of it.
[01:59:37.864 --> 01:59:40.364]  There's a big article by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:59:40.444 --> 01:59:42.524]  on Infowars.com that needs to be shared.
[01:59:43.865 --> 01:59:46.765]  Man sickest in his life after taking an experimental vaccine.
[01:59:48.806 --> 01:59:54.847]  You know Ian Hayden from many appearances on CNN and other networks celebrating his heroic act of volunteering to test
[01:59:55.899 --> 01:59:57.660]  Modera's experimental COVID vaccine.
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:01.121]  The sun has now set on Hayden's television career.
[02:00:01.161 --> 02:00:07.142]  He is no longer useful to the pharma media narratives that all vaccines are always safe for all people.
[02:00:07.862 --> 02:00:13.964]  Modera's business partners Tony Fauci and Bill Gates were justified in skipping animal studies and going right to humans.
[02:00:15.605 --> 02:00:18.806]  Ian Hayden is now an embarrassment to Fauci, Gates, and the CNN cheerleaders.
[02:00:20.226 --> 02:00:23.347]  He will therefore vanish into the censorship twilight.
[02:00:25.185 --> 02:00:30.106]  Modera chose Hayden for the study because of his robust good health.
[02:00:30.967 --> 02:00:34.128]  He was among the 15 volunteers in the high-dose group.
[02:00:34.728 --> 02:00:45.751]  With 45 days, three of these, a shocking 20% experienced serious adverse events according to Modera's press release, meaning they required hospitalization and medical intervention.
[02:00:47.652 --> 02:00:48.952]  You like getting paralyzed?
[02:00:52.182 --> 02:01:04.949]  And this is what they're coming at you and your family with, and they've got their mRNA vaccines, also being produced by Moderna, that go into the cell and reprogram it.
[02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:08.350]  Wow, that's really nice.
[02:01:09.271 --> 02:01:13.113]  Do I have to go into how deadly that is, how dangerous that is, how insane, how reckless?
[02:01:13.133 --> 02:01:14.294]  We're all guinea pigs now.
[02:01:15.434 --> 02:01:17.355]  You're in the guinea pig cage now.
[02:01:17.375 --> 02:01:18.436]  They got that old
[02:01:19.639 --> 02:01:20.600]  Johnny Cash song.
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.141]  You're in the jailhouse now.
[02:01:22.161 --> 02:01:24.443]  He's in the jailhouse now.
[02:01:24.463 --> 02:01:26.765]  How about, you're in your coffin now.
[02:01:29.888 --> 02:01:31.009]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:01:31.049 --> 02:01:33.391]  That's why Gates said though, oh, there's going to be a lot of side effects.
[02:01:33.511 --> 02:01:36.454]  Oh, things aren't turning on for a long time.
[02:01:38.115 --> 02:01:42.579]  And now, even CNBC goes, oh yeah!
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:45.142]  Topside to say, it doesn't even exist.
[02:01:45.162 --> 02:01:46.443]  It's just a regular cold virus.
[02:01:47.602 --> 02:01:48.383]  But it exists.
[02:01:48.423 --> 02:01:51.165]  It's a patented little special juicy.
[02:01:51.985 --> 02:01:54.447]  So they can keep releasing new variants of it every year.
[02:01:54.487 --> 02:01:58.931]  And I predict they'll release a really deadly form of it and say, oh, you said it was a hoax.
[02:01:58.991 --> 02:01:59.751]  It's really deadly now.
[02:02:00.132 --> 02:02:00.912]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:02:01.213 --> 02:02:02.654]  All of you that want to die.
[02:02:03.474 --> 02:02:08.018]  If you submit to the globalists and they think you're going to go along with it, they're going to release stuff that will kill everybody.
[02:02:08.518 --> 02:02:11.621]  And then you can all enjoy yourselves.
[02:02:13.102 --> 02:02:15.884]  Everyone can take a knee permanently and climb into a dirt nap.
[02:02:21.288 --> 02:02:22.508]  They've downloaded the video.
[02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:28.311]  We'll have it at the end of the hour if Du wants to come in and take a little bit of the time from the great John Rappaport.
[02:02:29.011 --> 02:02:37.795]  But Drew Brees came out and Twitter didn't erase his video that he's now being fired for and getting in a lot of trouble losing contracts.
[02:02:38.355 --> 02:02:45.898]  They just have it skipped back to the beginning and don't tell you that they've manipulated it, but we were able to find another copy.
[02:02:47.239 --> 02:02:47.759]  That's coming up.
[02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:54.099]  So, this is live time, out of control censorship going on, big time.
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:56.181]  There's another video.
[02:02:59.264 --> 02:03:02.808]  This is linked up on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:03:02.828 --> 02:03:05.050]  A lot of folks are mad at Drudge, and I haven't seen a big change in Drudge.
[02:03:05.070 --> 02:03:08.153]  I haven't talked to Drudge in a long time, at least they do carry some of the M4 war stories.
[02:03:09.074 --> 02:03:12.197]  And it shows what happens out in the suburbs of California.
[02:03:13.137 --> 02:03:18.900]  When Antiva tries to come and knock out windows and burn things, here's some of the video of what happened there.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:21.741]  It ain't going good at all.
[02:03:22.282 --> 02:03:26.085]  They just beat the ever-loving snot out of three or four guys, and it's going again.
[02:03:26.105 --> 02:03:28.347]  God damn it.
[02:03:28.507 --> 02:03:30.689]  The Antifa guys are not doing well here.
[02:03:30.729 --> 02:03:32.170]  They're all getting the s*** kicked out of them.
[02:03:32.190 --> 02:03:35.974]  I can't breathe!
[02:03:36.394 --> 02:03:37.495]  Justice for Floyd!
[02:03:38.116 --> 02:03:41.138]  Justice for Floyd!
[02:03:41.218 --> 02:03:41.939]  It's going bad.
[02:03:45.208 --> 02:03:47.669]  The Antifa guys are being chased like crazy.
[02:03:48.489 --> 02:03:50.290]  Those in Yucaipa ain't the place to be.
[02:03:50.610 --> 02:03:59.133]  And again, those are just a bunch of dirty university professors and their sub-oids that they go and hire meth-heads to literally cause a war.
[02:04:00.754 --> 02:04:06.136]  Using a black dude who got killed in what looks like bad police action.
[02:04:06.876 --> 02:04:10.098]  The Antifa guys are just, you can't come to Yucaipa with this s***.
[02:04:12.188 --> 02:04:13.429]  You can't come to Yucaipa.
[02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:15.010]  They're getting the **** kicked out.
[02:04:15.131 --> 02:04:18.653]  Look, it's all white dudes.
[02:04:18.774 --> 02:04:25.119]  Why would you go somewhere and try to knock out windows in a convenience store?
[02:04:25.139 --> 02:04:26.120]  I mean, what does it even do?
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:27.901]  Enough, guys.
[02:04:28.181 --> 02:04:29.182]  We don't need to follow them.
[02:04:29.202 --> 02:04:31.064]  They never attacked the globalists.
[02:04:31.584 --> 02:04:32.325]  They've had enough.
[02:04:33.302 --> 02:04:33.902]  All right, that's good.
[02:04:34.822 --> 02:04:41.564]  Here is some trendy white kids up in their five-story building listening to what they think soul music.
[02:04:41.984 --> 02:04:54.387]  I mean, I'm telling you, man, there's so many glow-in-the-dark white kids that never left their house, and then they buy into all this Black Lives Matter stuff that's run by the most vicious big tech companies that literally own giant death camps with three million Muslims in them making Apple parts.
[02:04:54.587 --> 02:04:56.948]  I mean, it's on record, but it's like Tim Cook's games.
[02:04:56.988 --> 02:04:58.048]  It's like, death camp!
[02:04:58.908 --> 02:05:00.229]  Jared Kushner, death camp!
[02:05:01.289 --> 02:05:03.830]  And so they're just up there listening to their soul music.
[02:05:03.850 --> 02:05:05.751]  They're like, oh hi black people!
[02:05:07.112 --> 02:05:11.033]  And all those black people see is white people, they've been told are bad, waving at them.
[02:05:11.213 --> 02:05:12.314]  So they throw rocks at them.
[02:05:12.674 --> 02:05:13.935]  By the way, good shots as well.
[02:05:13.995 --> 02:05:14.335]  Here it is.
[02:05:39.133 --> 02:05:41.033]  There's massive censorship everywhere.
[02:05:41.053 --> 02:05:44.735]  AI is watching everything you do on these big platforms, controlling you.
[02:05:44.935 --> 02:05:48.917]  They're now force-feeding you propaganda, sending you Marxist-Leninist garbage.
[02:05:49.597 --> 02:05:53.719]  The authoritarianism that's at the universities is now invading the rest of the country.
[02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:55.160]  It's only going to get worse.
[02:05:55.580 --> 02:05:59.042]  They produced the movie Joker to train the public to kill police randomly.
[02:05:59.242 --> 02:06:01.964]  The police are bowing and loving it and worshipping it in most areas.
[02:06:02.544 --> 02:06:05.266]  The appeasement we've been taught is about to be our destruction.
[02:06:06.428 --> 02:06:17.152]  But it has been your word of mouth about Bandot Video, about NewsWars.com, about InfoWars.com forward slash show that has increased the traffic five times what it was just a year ago.
[02:06:17.352 --> 02:06:17.992]  And that's awesome.
[02:06:18.233 --> 02:06:19.513]  So InfoWars lived.
[02:06:20.613 --> 02:06:21.494]  InfoWars lives.
[02:06:21.794 --> 02:06:25.075]  Everybody else is being shut down and totally silenced.
[02:06:25.575 --> 02:06:27.536]  They've bought up almost all the talk radio.
[02:06:27.656 --> 02:06:31.638]  It just gets more and more and more insane by the minute.
[02:06:32.318 --> 02:06:33.658]  It's completely out of control.
[02:06:34.799 --> 02:06:34.919]  And
[02:06:36.365 --> 02:06:37.366]  We have to stay on air.
[02:06:37.926 --> 02:06:40.849]  Now, they're moving into the physical attack mode to try to get us, as you've seen.
[02:06:41.449 --> 02:06:46.174]  And they're moving into other areas, because they cannot have us on air when they try to kill the President.
[02:06:46.994 --> 02:06:48.415]  Or when they try to burn down every city.
[02:06:48.496 --> 02:06:50.377]  But we're still here, thanks to you.
[02:06:50.457 --> 02:06:53.160]  So listen, while we're still here, and that means us together,
[02:06:54.093 --> 02:06:58.154]  Tell people, hey, there's an American resistance to this foreign Chinese funded overthrow.
[02:06:58.434 --> 02:07:00.114]  Find out the truth at Band.Video.
[02:07:00.574 --> 02:07:05.675]  Click the top, click the Alex Jones Show, the other shows, David Knight, it's all there, you'll find the truth.
[02:07:06.215 --> 02:07:14.397]  And all the different band videos that are being taken off Twitter and YouTube, we contact the people that put the video up, say, hey, give us a copy, we'll put it up, we host it, we pay for it.
[02:07:14.457 --> 02:07:19.918]  That's where your money goes to finance your voice, your speech, your information.
[02:07:20.778 --> 02:07:21.799]  Band.Video.
[02:07:23.835 --> 02:07:25.397]  Share it now to your email list.
[02:07:25.497 --> 02:07:29.842]  Share it now to your friends, your family, and then get products that are amazing that you already need.
[02:07:31.559 --> 02:07:34.522]  Like Vitamin D3, that's super high quality, and our ultimate krill oil.
[02:07:34.862 --> 02:07:36.864]  RainForce Plus, the great nootropic.
[02:07:37.145 --> 02:07:38.826]  Survival Shield X2, the essential.
[02:07:39.827 --> 02:07:41.869]  DNA Force Plus, that is so important to get.
[02:07:41.889 --> 02:07:45.292]  60% off flash sale, because things are so insane.
[02:07:45.312 --> 02:07:55.022]  I wasn't going to have a sale this big, even at Christmas, but I've just decided that we need to get everything we have out of the warehouse and into your hands, so we have funds to go through at least the next 152 days.
[02:07:55.122 --> 02:07:55.662]  Because let me tell you,
[02:07:56.343 --> 02:07:59.246]  If they make their move on Trump and the country, they're going to disconnect everything.
[02:07:59.467 --> 02:08:01.569]  They've got IP addresses to shut everything down.
[02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:02.590]  You won't be able to get any of this.
[02:08:03.751 --> 02:08:08.637]  If you sign up at infowars.com forward slash newsletter, it's free.
[02:08:08.877 --> 02:08:12.941]  We will still be able to send you videos, maybe, to your email to share.
[02:08:13.562 --> 02:08:21.507]  We're still gonna have those networks, but if they kill the president, they're gonna burn everything down, cut the food off, and then make you turn your guns in to get the food.
[02:08:21.927 --> 02:08:23.648]  Just like they did in 1917 in Russia.
[02:08:23.769 --> 02:08:25.189]  It's the same blueprint, same deal.
[02:08:25.229 --> 02:08:31.133]  So, get your supplies now, get your storable food now, as I hope we're gonna defeat this, but you cannot be enough alarmist.
[02:08:31.413 --> 02:08:34.876]  This is absolutely maximum globalist communist takeover, okay?
[02:08:35.276 --> 02:08:39.799]  So, infowarestore.com, well you still can, because there's only months left if Trump and the military don't act.
[02:08:40.319 --> 02:08:41.460]  They brought us this situation.
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:44.303]  We'll be right back with the next hour and Jon Rappaport stay with us.
[02:08:45.204 --> 02:08:46.806]  We just saw a giant hoax.
[02:08:47.948 --> 02:08:51.613]  They now have top scientists confirming COVID-19 is a complete fraud.
[02:08:51.653 --> 02:08:52.434]  Jon Rappaport's right.
[02:08:53.772 --> 02:09:09.375]  And now they're still moving ahead with forced inoculations and permanent lockdowns and big tech tracking all our locations with Black Lives Matter, every major tech platform, forced taking over your phone and computer and services you pay for and forcing you to hear how you're a bad white person.
[02:09:09.695 --> 02:09:11.876]  We're all in a giant re-education camp.
[02:09:12.856 --> 02:09:20.118]  This is fantastically illegal, fantastically dangerous, just insanely 1984.
[02:09:24.176 --> 02:09:32.558]  And it's only going to get worse because no one got in trouble for all the coup attempts and all the insanity and the craziness.
[02:09:34.018 --> 02:09:39.359]  And then you look at how disconnected and insane the Democrat leadership is, you think, oh good, they're morons.
[02:09:39.759 --> 02:09:41.740]  Nancy Pelosi can't find her ass with both hands.
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:43.640]  That's why we're even in more danger!
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:44.760]  They're crazy!
[02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:48.801]  And the most radical, whacked-out Marxist-Leninist
[02:09:50.026 --> 02:09:53.989]  That are out there destabilizing things for the Rothschilds are the ones that are in control now.
[02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:56.651]  This is just degeneracy.
[02:09:56.671 --> 02:09:59.934]  This isn't just the elites, the alpha maggots out of control.
[02:10:03.277 --> 02:10:11.523]  This is the corruption of the human soul and the domestication and people taken off the land and taken out of nature and turned into these
[02:10:12.637 --> 02:10:14.438]  House gerbils that we've all become.
[02:10:14.879 --> 02:10:16.039]  And we're all becoming weak.
[02:10:16.059 --> 02:10:17.200]  We're all becoming stupid.
[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:18.721]  And there's an awakening to that.
[02:10:18.741 --> 02:10:20.242]  We're trying to climb out of the hole.
[02:10:20.903 --> 02:10:23.945]  But big pharma and all of it is trying to shove us back in there.
[02:10:23.965 --> 02:10:29.268]  And there's an 89% increase in psychotropics and, you know, drug prescriptions.
[02:10:29.308 --> 02:10:31.710]  And we're just being bombed with chemical weapons.
[02:10:31.950 --> 02:10:36.413]  And we have to say no and reject everything that the corporate media and the new world order pushes.
[02:10:36.813 --> 02:10:38.114]  All of it is death!
[02:10:38.855 --> 02:10:40.115]  All of it is the enemy!
[02:10:41.192 --> 02:10:44.877]  All of it is mass psychotic behavior.
[02:10:45.117 --> 02:10:47.220]  French Revolution on PCP.
[02:10:48.361 --> 02:10:49.603]  We have become a rabbit.
[02:10:49.643 --> 02:10:51.065]  John Rappaport's coming up.
[02:11:02.068 --> 02:11:03.389]  Therapists in the U.S.
[02:11:03.449 --> 02:11:09.091]  say they are seeing increasing numbers of patients with what they call Donald Trump Anxiety Disorder.
[02:11:09.171 --> 02:11:10.731]  Trump Anxiety Disorder.
[02:11:10.991 --> 02:11:14.833]  Trump Derangement Syndrome.
[02:11:16.473 --> 02:11:19.294]  Trump Derangement Syndrome is clinically real.
[02:11:19.314 --> 02:11:25.677]  It doesn't merely affect individuals, but entire political parties, rendering them unrecognizable.
[02:11:26.077 --> 02:11:27.877]  One minute, they're perfectly normal.
[02:11:28.057 --> 02:11:29.438]  The next, rapid.
[02:11:33.587 --> 02:11:37.189]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly.
[02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:39.691]  Families and culture are collapsing.
[02:11:39.791 --> 02:11:44.834]  And godless leftists are behaving just like zombies of modern lore.
[02:11:44.895 --> 02:11:46.315]  You can't trust your mother.
[02:11:46.375 --> 02:11:48.137]  Get the hell out of here!
[02:11:48.157 --> 02:11:50.818]  Get the f*** out of here!
[02:11:52.119 --> 02:11:52.920]  You're best friends.
[02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:58.051]  Next door.
[02:11:58.071 --> 02:12:03.213]  Psychologist Dr. Stuart Bassman says for his clients, it started the morning after the election.
[02:12:03.273 --> 02:12:07.515]  Doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump anxiety disorder.
[02:12:07.575 --> 02:12:13.498]  A number of people are manifesting what I would call post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:12:13.518 --> 02:12:19.161]  An overpowering fear that President Trump represents the end of the world.
[02:12:23.913 --> 02:12:26.675]  Pray, it doesn't happen to you.
[02:12:27.016 --> 02:12:28.277]  Landlord, they're dead!
[02:12:30.358 --> 02:12:37.283]  Rev it.
[02:12:37.844 --> 02:12:38.884]  White males.
[02:12:45.495 --> 02:12:48.356]  The only way the dog hunts is you spread the word.
[02:12:48.676 --> 02:12:52.158]  You are the sea on which the ship of truth sails.
[02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:54.259]  John Rappaport takes over.
[02:12:54.539 --> 02:13:00.402]  But first, a short two-minute clip from myself in 2018 predicting all of this back in 60 seconds.
[02:13:00.462 --> 02:13:01.182]  Spread the word.
[02:13:01.722 --> 02:13:03.103]  Rappaport's loaded for bear.
[02:13:03.883 --> 02:13:05.604]  They are taking over the U.S.
[02:13:05.704 --> 02:13:07.084]  They are creating the racial division.
[02:13:07.604 --> 02:13:09.205]  They are creating the sexual division.
[02:13:09.545 --> 02:13:15.907]  They are creating all of the admitted crises in this country in their own admissions in WikiLeaks.
[02:13:16.287 --> 02:13:20.328]  And they're horrified to see the economy coming back and all these good things happening.
[02:13:20.348 --> 02:13:27.230]  So they're going to throw their full force against America in an attempt to encircle Congress with a million people.
[02:13:28.010 --> 02:13:32.532]  And then to begin violent actions to run the patriots in D.C.
[02:13:32.712 --> 02:13:35.193]  out of the swamp so they can reestablish it.
[02:13:35.973 --> 02:13:37.734]  They believe that they're cornered.
[02:13:38.134 --> 02:13:39.655]  They know humanity's waking up.
[02:13:39.935 --> 02:13:47.859]  And so they're going to launch their full assault of violence and intimidation and terrorist attacks, I believe, in this country.
[02:13:48.479 --> 02:13:50.840]  They've got all the Democratic Party talking heads saying,
[02:13:52.105 --> 02:13:54.967]  Attack Trump supporters, bully them, kick them out of restaurants.
[02:13:55.247 --> 02:14:00.151]  And when you see the weak-minded people, they've got lined up to support them and to chant.
[02:14:00.311 --> 02:14:13.802]  They're all professors or government workers or little scared leftists that bought into the fact that they were on the winning team and they were the cool group and they ran everything and they were going to teach flyover country and Christians and veterans and everybody.
[02:14:14.582 --> 02:14:16.463]  They were the ruling class.
[02:14:16.583 --> 02:14:20.006]  These people don't believe in the dream of human empowerment.
[02:14:20.046 --> 02:14:23.908]  They believe in China and its enslavement of their own population.
[02:14:23.928 --> 02:14:25.509]  They believe in authoritarianism.
[02:14:25.570 --> 02:14:29.232]  They believe if they go kiss the ass of the globalists, they are in power.
[02:14:29.532 --> 02:14:30.253]  InfoWars.
[02:14:30.633 --> 02:14:32.254]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:14:32.274 --> 02:14:38.859]  This is John Rappaport sitting in on the fourth hour here.
[02:14:38.879 --> 02:14:41.640]  Oh boy.
[02:14:43.562 --> 02:14:43.782]  So,
[02:14:44.585 --> 02:14:47.126]  The riots, whatever you want to call them.
[02:14:49.568 --> 02:15:04.255]  There's a lot of things I could say about that, but one of the things that I want to make clear is the COVID-19 story has been falling apart, piece by piece, lie by lie.
[02:15:06.476 --> 02:15:11.759]  My tech producer told me the other day, I've written 140 articles on COVID-19 since the beginning.
[02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:13.600]  I had no idea.
[02:15:14.406 --> 02:15:15.286]  I just keep going.
[02:15:18.147 --> 02:15:39.096]  And so I've seen how different pieces of the story about social distancing, the masks, the isolation, the discovery of the virus even, the tests, the case numbers, one phony piece of lying after another is exposed.
[02:15:40.683 --> 02:16:06.028]  Just by people in the so-called alternative media, and not just by certain doctors here and there, but by mainstream public officials in other countries, by researchers who have all kinds of mainstream credentials in other countries, by other governments,
[02:16:08.322 --> 02:16:28.673]  Who are seeing through all of these lies and making it known that the people at the top of the World Health Organization and the CDC and so on and so forth and people like Fauci are basically political that has nothing to do with their scientific ability or talent or expertise or anything like that.
[02:16:31.035 --> 02:16:37.138]  They're the mouthpieces for Bill Gates, the United Nations, the World Health Organization,
[02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:55.834]  The World Economic Forum, who from the beginning have been planning to use this fake epidemic as the excuse for and the doorway into the new normal.
[02:16:57.594 --> 02:16:58.814]  That's what they like to call it.
[02:17:00.275 --> 02:17:04.135]  Which is really the brave new world of technocracy.
[02:17:05.676 --> 02:17:07.616]  That's what they have settled on.
[02:17:08.502 --> 02:17:12.865]  Long ago as a pattern for global control and governance.
[02:17:14.947 --> 02:17:35.702]  5G, Internet of Things, smart cities, energy quotas eventually for every citizen, social credit scores, of course, vaccination up to your eyeballs, surveillance of the planet inch by inch in real time,
[02:17:36.348 --> 02:17:41.453]  From thousands of new satellites in space, etc., etc., etc.
[02:17:42.735 --> 02:17:43.996]  High-tech slavery.
[02:17:45.277 --> 02:17:46.258]  That's their model.
[02:17:48.301 --> 02:17:59.152]  And COVID-19 is supposed to be the excuse, somehow, don't look for logic, into saying we can never go back, it's got to be a new world, new normal.
[02:17:59.861 --> 02:18:09.828]  Borderless nations, one global governance plan, catch the new pandemics earlier before they spread, etc, etc.
[02:18:10.068 --> 02:18:13.490]  All of that kind of baloney.
[02:18:14.591 --> 02:18:15.231]  Top down.
[02:18:18.633 --> 02:18:28.600]  But nevertheless, the COVID-19 story has been falling apart, not just fraying at the edges, but
[02:18:29.275 --> 02:18:30.716]  Starting to collapse.
[02:18:31.777 --> 02:18:45.245]  And of course, with the reopening of the economy, people who come out of their houses are focusing on getting back to work, earning a living, enjoying the outdoors.
[02:18:46.466 --> 02:18:49.308]  They're not focused on catching a disease.
[02:18:51.629 --> 02:18:58.634]  So all of these factors present a tremendous and distinct threat to the global planners.
[02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:07.211]  A threat that maybe their excuse is not powerful enough to usher in altogether the world order.
[02:19:08.111 --> 02:19:23.836]  So one of the purposes, one of the purposes of all of these organized and coordinated riots across America is an operation to cover another operation.
[02:19:25.217 --> 02:19:26.517]  An operation to
[02:19:27.574 --> 02:19:38.956]  Deflect the public attention and the professional attention entirely away from the collapsing COVID-19 story and refocus it on the new threat.
[02:19:39.777 --> 02:19:44.998]  That's not the only purpose, but I'm telling you, that's very important and never forget it.
[02:19:46.578 --> 02:19:49.219]  That is one of the main things.
[02:19:51.119 --> 02:19:55.400]  It's like the television news networks are taking
[02:19:56.261 --> 02:20:20.075]  All of that around-the-clock COVID-19 coverage that people have been watching the mass mind control operation and wiping it off the screen on one side and then on the other they're bringing in all the riot coverage around the clock to cover the story, the COVID-19 story.
[02:20:20.935 --> 02:20:23.617]  One operation covers another.
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:32.042]  It's just like what happens in a theater between Act 1 and Act 2 of a play.
[02:20:33.322 --> 02:20:34.662]  The curtain comes down.
[02:20:35.223 --> 02:20:38.243]  The crew suddenly races out onto the stage.
[02:20:38.863 --> 02:20:40.164]  The audience doesn't see it.
[02:20:40.804 --> 02:20:46.125]  They move the props and the flats around and they change the sets for Act 2.
[02:20:46.665 --> 02:20:50.146]  The curtain goes up and the audience is looking at something completely new.
[02:20:51.687 --> 02:20:52.847]  It's the same thing.
[02:20:53.663 --> 02:20:56.906]  COVID-19 was Act One, the riots are Act Two.
[02:20:57.947 --> 02:21:14.640]  In this case, again to repeat myself, the farce, the fake pandemic falling apart as a story is obscured and buried by what you're seeing on the screen right now.
[02:21:15.481 --> 02:21:21.766]  The riots from organized, controlled, coordinated riots from one end of the country to another.
[02:21:26.735 --> 02:21:27.776]  That's a biggie, folks.
[02:21:29.337 --> 02:21:31.438]  They're going to come back with COVID-19.
[02:21:31.478 --> 02:21:32.379]  You can be sure of that.
[02:21:32.419 --> 02:21:35.781]  They're not finished with that by any stretch of the imagination.
[02:21:36.701 --> 02:21:44.466]  But they're adjusting their toupees, their stories, their pretensions, their messaging.
[02:21:45.747 --> 02:21:56.154]  They're figuring out how to move to the next escalated phase of COVID-19, which is the central operation.
[02:21:58.499 --> 02:22:01.781]  And it also includes, of course, the vaccination.
[02:22:02.241 --> 02:22:09.924]  If they can bring it to market, finally, the COVID-19 vaccine for 7, 8 billion people on the planet.
[02:22:10.665 --> 02:22:12.065]  Bill Gates' wet dream.
[02:22:13.286 --> 02:22:14.867]  And we have to talk about that.
[02:22:15.707 --> 02:22:17.368]  This is serious business.
[02:22:17.468 --> 02:22:22.911]  It may not seem so serious at the moment because of the riots.
[02:22:23.091 --> 02:22:23.891]  I understand that.
[02:22:25.339 --> 02:22:35.306]  But very early on when I was speaking to Alex on air, I said, pointing to China, the epidemic is a fake.
[02:22:35.867 --> 02:22:37.568]  The vaccine is the hammer.
[02:22:38.569 --> 02:22:39.490]  And it still is.
[02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:41.811]  And it's very important.
[02:22:42.252 --> 02:22:46.355]  And we'll get into details about that coming up right after the break.
[02:22:46.415 --> 02:22:47.015]  Stay with us.
[02:22:48.316 --> 02:22:53.620]  OK, so we're going to talk about the vaccine, the COVID vaccine here.
[02:22:54.326 --> 02:22:55.527]  Because that is the hammer.
[02:22:56.027 --> 02:22:58.329]  That's what Bill Gates is doing all this for.
[02:22:58.989 --> 02:23:00.150]  That's why he's there.
[02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:02.872]  This was the plan since the beginning.
[02:23:03.873 --> 02:23:05.874]  Everything would lead up to that.
[02:23:08.036 --> 02:23:12.299]  So I've discussed before the possibilities of what this vaccine is going to be.
[02:23:13.599 --> 02:23:16.221]  And I'll just summarize for now.
[02:23:18.123 --> 02:23:22.906]  It could be a traditional type of vaccine like we've seen before with the standard
[02:23:23.576 --> 02:23:28.800]  levels of toxicity and so forth, which are considerable, make no mistake about it.
[02:23:30.181 --> 02:23:49.215]  Or it could be two new technologies for vaccines which have never been introduced into the marketplace before, but could be slipped in now under the rush and the hysteria of we have to have a solution and we've got to do it right now and we can't wait.
[02:23:51.383 --> 02:23:59.165]  And they would be, first of all, DNA technology, DNA vaccines, which are not really vaccines at all.
[02:24:00.586 --> 02:24:02.186]  They are gene therapy.
[02:24:03.887 --> 02:24:13.290]  And this was overtly mentioned in the New York Times on March 10, 2015, in an article about DNA vaccines.
[02:24:14.310 --> 02:24:16.631]  I've cited it, quoted it several times.
[02:24:17.691 --> 02:24:19.291]  It's not really a vaccine.
[02:24:19.832 --> 02:24:20.992]  It's gene therapy.
[02:24:22.930 --> 02:24:36.260]  The theory is they inject synthesized genes into the body that set off a series of reactions that make a person immune to a particular disease.
[02:24:37.701 --> 02:24:38.021]  Okay.
[02:24:39.663 --> 02:24:47.789]  The point of the article, really, when you read down far enough, was to see that introducing these genes
[02:24:48.624 --> 02:24:53.785]  permanently alters the genetic makeup of the person who receives the vaccine.
[02:24:54.785 --> 02:24:55.425]  Any person.
[02:24:56.066 --> 02:24:56.706]  Every person.
[02:24:58.646 --> 02:25:05.608]  And they go to a noble laureate, Dr. David Baltimore, and they ask him for his opinion about this.
[02:25:05.688 --> 02:25:08.428]  Because, after all, he's investigating these vaccines.
[02:25:10.529 --> 02:25:15.910]  And he says, yes, it's a, you know, very interesting technology and so forth.
[02:25:16.330 --> 02:25:17.050]  He says, but
[02:25:17.981 --> 02:25:24.567]  I can see how some people might be leery about altering their genetic makeup.
[02:25:24.807 --> 02:25:25.688]  Really, David?
[02:25:26.749 --> 02:25:28.711]  A few people might be leery?
[02:25:33.915 --> 02:25:37.278]  Permanently alters your genetic makeup.
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:44.925]  And if you think that the experts really know exactly how and in what way,
[02:25:45.635 --> 02:25:47.356]  It will alter your genetic makeup.
[02:25:47.396 --> 02:25:48.677]  You're extremely naive.
[02:25:50.518 --> 02:26:07.987]  Because research paper after research paper shows that in this genetic type tinkering with humans, there are always unintended consequences, even in animal studies, where the ripples just keep on going.
[02:26:08.848 --> 02:26:15.051]  It's not just, oh, we change this thing, which is bad enough, but then that led
[02:26:15.575 --> 02:26:17.175]  To this, to that, to this, to that.
[02:26:17.835 --> 02:26:23.897]  Multiple domino effects at the same time with completely unknown consequences.
[02:26:25.597 --> 02:26:30.118]  So that is one possibility for a COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:26:30.958 --> 02:26:33.219]  The other is called an RNA vaccine.
[02:26:34.619 --> 02:26:44.121]  That's getting a lot of attention because an absurd company named Moderna, which is working in conjunction with Anthony Fauci,
[02:26:45.106 --> 02:26:54.510]  at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is in clinical trials of an RNA COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:57.732]  And so far, the results don't look very good at all.
[02:26:58.572 --> 02:27:03.434]  But not to worry, they're plunging ahead.
[02:27:05.935 --> 02:27:07.616]  What is the problem there?
[02:27:09.614 --> 02:27:20.400]  Other companies have tried to bring this technology to the marketplace and they have failed because they've always encountered very serious safety problems.
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:26.783]  That means harm to people in clinical trials.
[02:27:28.724 --> 02:27:30.405]  What particular kind of harm?
[02:27:30.965 --> 02:27:35.708]  Well, for example, what's called autoimmune reaction.
[02:27:36.471 --> 02:27:39.953]  Which is basically, the body goes to war against itself.
[02:27:43.155 --> 02:27:52.021]  It looks at some aspect or parts of itself as the enemy, the immune system does, and then it tries to defeat it.
[02:27:52.682 --> 02:27:57.225]  Which causes anything from organ failures to who knows what.
[02:27:58.085 --> 02:27:58.686]  Horrendous!
[02:28:00.567 --> 02:28:00.867]  But!
[02:28:04.490 --> 02:28:05.030]  Fauci
[02:28:05.612 --> 02:28:16.539]  Bill Gates and others really, really, really want to get an RNA product like a vaccine into the marketplace.
[02:28:16.559 --> 02:28:16.619]  Why?
[02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:33.371]  Because manufacturing one, bringing it to market is much faster, much easier, much quicker than manufacturing and producing the old type vaccine.
[02:28:34.912 --> 02:28:35.372]  What does that
[02:28:36.209 --> 02:28:52.157]  Well, that means that for any new virus or old virus or invented virus or fake virus that the World Health Organization or Bill Gates decides is important at the moment, they can simply say, hey, we can have a vaccine ready in two months.
[02:28:53.938 --> 02:28:55.778]  So what does that add?
[02:28:55.798 --> 02:29:03.102]  200 of new vaccines on the market forced upon the population with disastrous consequences.
[02:29:06.058 --> 02:29:08.520]  So there you have the other kind of technology.
[02:29:10.261 --> 02:29:33.560]  Now on top of all of this, and an article that I just posted on my website today, has to do with the, excuse me, sorry, frog, with the contamination of traditional vaccines with nanoparticles.
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:44.143]  Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny particles from nanotechnology.
[02:29:45.584 --> 02:30:05.972]  This is based on a 2017 study, which I quote extensively out of Italy, in which the researchers apparently, for the first time, used an electron microscope and other such means to look at traditional vaccines
[02:30:06.536 --> 02:30:26.422]  Like the DPT, the MMR, the HPV, and so on and so forth, flu vaccines, manufactured by many of the biggest producers in the world, whose names you're familiar with, to see what they could find.
[02:30:27.182 --> 02:30:35.125]  And at that deep, deep, deep level, they found massive contamination of these vaccines
[02:30:35.779 --> 02:30:40.360]  With mostly metallic nanoparticles.
[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:43.521]  Many different elements and compounds.
[02:30:44.501 --> 02:30:46.982]  Some of which puzzle them completely.
[02:30:47.982 --> 02:30:51.823]  In some cases, clusters of these nanoparticles.
[02:30:52.524 --> 02:31:01.646]  In other cases, the bonding of the metallic nanoparticles to biological substances in the body.
[02:31:03.086 --> 02:31:05.027]  Alright, so I was talking about the
[02:31:05.916 --> 02:31:22.705]  Contamination of traditional vaccines with these tiny, tiny metallic nanoparticles that cause chronic, ongoing inflammatory reaction in the body, which is extremely debilitating and dangerous.
[02:31:26.247 --> 02:31:31.830]  Now, the researchers on this study, this Italian study, they don't know how
[02:31:34.229 --> 02:31:36.770]  These nanoparticles got into vaccines.
[02:31:37.951 --> 02:31:39.392]  That was not part of their research.
[02:31:41.353 --> 02:31:46.435]  They don't know where the vaccines were originally manufactured.
[02:31:49.236 --> 02:31:52.638]  Or where components of the vaccines were originally manufactured.
[02:31:53.158 --> 02:31:54.439]  These are key questions.
[02:31:55.560 --> 02:32:02.083]  For example, domestically in the United States, we know that a great many of our vaccines or
[02:32:02.941 --> 02:32:08.223]  These are vital questions that need to be answered and until they are, as far as I'm concerned,
[02:32:32.430 --> 02:32:37.614]  One would be suicidal to trust the authorities about any vaccines whatsoever.
[02:32:38.434 --> 02:32:47.641]  And on this show and others, I've spoken already about the idea and the concept that vaccines were a lunatic notion from the beginning.
[02:32:48.421 --> 02:32:49.562]  They were never safe.
[02:32:49.622 --> 02:32:50.863]  They were never effective.
[02:32:50.903 --> 02:32:52.024]  They were never useful.
[02:32:52.444 --> 02:32:53.865]  They never meant anything.
[02:32:56.447 --> 02:33:01.891]  Their only real effect, when there is an effect, is destruction in the body.
[02:33:03.638 --> 02:33:29.025]  And because they can suppress outward symptoms, visible symptoms of diseases, researchers and doctors automatically assume that means that they're preventing those diseases, which is a gigantic lie and is the basic lie at the bottom of all vaccines that makes these people say, well, we just eliminated a million cases of measles.
[02:33:29.105 --> 02:33:29.645]  No, you didn't.
[02:33:30.285 --> 02:33:30.766]  No, you didn't.
[02:33:31.386 --> 02:33:32.446]  Nothing of the sort happened.
[02:33:33.038 --> 02:33:34.118]  You're total liars!
[02:33:34.738 --> 02:33:35.618]  You're fakers!
[02:33:36.419 --> 02:33:37.079]  You're scum!
[02:33:37.919 --> 02:33:52.201]  Because you don't own up to the fact that what you did with those vaccines was you suppressed the outward symptoms of measles and that's your calling preventing cases of measles, which is a total lie.
[02:33:54.162 --> 02:34:01.163]  What you've done is you've engaged the immune system in a low-level war inside the body against
[02:34:01.909 --> 02:34:19.102]  What you've injected, reducing the capability of the immune system to produce the kind of reaction, healthy reaction, that would make these clinical signs of the disease visible, like rashes and so forth.
[02:34:20.182 --> 02:34:21.844]  The immune system can't do that anymore.
[02:34:21.864 --> 02:34:22.444]  It's too weak.
[02:34:23.085 --> 02:34:24.405]  So you don't see the symptoms.
[02:34:24.426 --> 02:34:26.467]  So you say you've eliminated the disease.
[02:34:26.487 --> 02:34:27.988]  It's a gigantic lie.
[02:34:28.088 --> 02:34:29.129]  Everybody buys it.
[02:34:29.781 --> 02:34:49.107]  And now you can go on to keep faking it about vaccines are wonderful, and we all know that, and the science is settled, and you know, all the horrific lies we've been told, which are going to culminate, if Bill Gates has his way, in a COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:34:51.808 --> 02:34:58.330]  Now, again, with nanoparticles of metallic origin, many different elements
[02:34:58.951 --> 02:35:06.635]  As found in this Italian study, contaminating vaccines, traditional vaccines, what else could this mean?
[02:35:07.835 --> 02:35:27.104]  I've also published an article, maybe you remember the Charles Lieber scandal, the head of the Department of Chemistry at Harvard, who was arrested and charged with lying to the federal government about his monetary financial connections to China.
[02:35:27.987 --> 02:35:29.368]  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:35:30.268 --> 02:35:41.692]  And in looking into this guy, I discovered, of course, that he is one of the pioneers and great technologists of nanotechnology in the world.
[02:35:42.872 --> 02:35:44.393]  That's why the Chinese want him.
[02:35:45.853 --> 02:35:56.177]  He has trained many, many, many students who have gone on to become professors, including Chinese students who come over here, get their PhDs, and now head up
[02:35:56.656 --> 02:36:00.277]  Nanotechnology departments at major US universities.
[02:36:03.257 --> 02:36:21.840]  Now in this article, in digging around to find out what nanotechnology was all about, I came across a piece from a journal or magazine called Nano Today that talked about using nano implants as tiny sensors.
[02:36:21.981 --> 02:36:24.521]  And we're talking, when I say tiny, I mean
[02:36:25.410 --> 02:36:26.751]  Really tiny, okay?
[02:36:27.512 --> 02:36:30.434]  It's not like tiny like a speck of dust on your table.
[02:36:31.095 --> 02:36:35.879]  That's like a planet compared to a nanoparticle.
[02:36:37.681 --> 02:36:41.424]  Tiny sensors placed inside the body.
[02:36:42.485 --> 02:36:46.849]  That is a major area of research and study today.
[02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:49.731]  And what would these sensors do?
[02:36:50.952 --> 02:36:52.974]  They would report out data
[02:36:54.215 --> 02:37:09.522]  To some control center, wherever that is, on what's happening inside the body right now in real time on physical processes, processes of the brain and other organs and so on and so forth.
[02:37:10.622 --> 02:37:23.908]  And the research is also focusing on using these tiny nano sensors to receive information sent in from the outside in the form of instruction.
[02:37:25.356 --> 02:37:26.137]  To the brain?
[02:37:27.458 --> 02:37:36.004]  Well, that opens the doorway to all manner of inquiry.
[02:37:37.065 --> 02:37:38.786]  Instructions about what?
[02:37:40.828 --> 02:37:52.997]  We know that out front they're talking about prosthesis and possible reversal of paralysis and so on and so forth, but behind that in places like
[02:37:54.787 --> 02:38:12.537]  The Chinese scientific establishment, DARPA, the technological arm of the Pentagon, Rockefeller Foundation Institute, and so on, where they're really interested in one thing, which is control, what kind of research are they really doing?
[02:38:14.278 --> 02:38:23.042]  To use these sensors to receive instructions inside the brain that would dictate feeling,
[02:38:25.865 --> 02:38:26.405]  Focus.
[02:38:28.467 --> 02:38:29.047]  You name it.
[02:38:30.027 --> 02:38:37.712]  It would just depend upon the effectiveness and the specificity of the technology.
[02:38:38.592 --> 02:38:40.813]  They would take it as far as it could go.
[02:38:41.634 --> 02:38:43.335]  That's their M.O.
[02:38:43.395 --> 02:38:44.255]  That's what they do.
[02:38:46.296 --> 02:38:51.879]  Whatever they can produce as an effect in the body and control, they'll do it.
[02:38:52.260 --> 02:38:53.000]  That's what they want.
[02:38:53.902 --> 02:39:03.327]  They're not going to say, oh well, we can't go for this, you know, all right, we've done our job and now it's time to just check out and, you know, tired.
[02:39:03.407 --> 02:39:03.647]  No.
[02:39:05.608 --> 02:39:08.169]  They're going to take this as far as they possibly can.
[02:39:10.551 --> 02:39:20.596]  So with the reality that we now understand of these huge numbers of metallic nanoparticles
[02:39:21.852 --> 02:39:41.966]  Inside the body, because the vaccines, traditional vaccines contain them, that does in fact open the door to asking, not just politely, but demanding an answer to, what are these nanoparticles doing there?
[02:39:42.606 --> 02:39:45.428]  And what use are you trying to make of them?
[02:39:47.810 --> 02:39:49.251]  Where did they come from?
[02:39:49.711 --> 02:39:51.112]  Who made the vaccine?
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:40:03.186]  How did the particles exactly get in there?
[02:40:05.168 --> 02:40:09.251]  The researchers of this Italian paper do not go into these matters.
[02:40:09.671 --> 02:40:11.452]  That was not their area of research.
[02:40:12.333 --> 02:40:20.079]  They broke through on the level of, hey, look what we found, but we have to go much further and ask
[02:40:20.751 --> 02:40:35.499]  Demand answers to these questions, otherwise, well, in any case, accepting and trusting vaccinologists to tell you to take vaccines is simply suicide.
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:38.141]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:40:48.575 --> 02:40:49.556]  Afternoon, everybody.
[02:40:49.596 --> 02:40:53.800]  Rob Dew here for the final segment of the Alex Jones Show, joining Jon Rappaport in.
[02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:56.341]  And it was something I discovered about an hour ago.
[02:40:56.882 --> 02:41:05.349]  There was an interview on Yahoo Finance on Twitter, and it's Drew Brees giving some remarks about how he feels about kneeling in the national anthem.
[02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:09.672]  And you can find the full article and videos on InfoWars right now.
[02:41:09.712 --> 02:41:13.395]  Twitter censors Drew Brees to stir up more racial division.
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:20.223]  And he sticks to his guns, which I like, but what I want to do is just explain a couple things before we go to this video.
[02:41:20.363 --> 02:41:27.747]  I screen captured the video portion where it's a minute and 44 seconds long, but at 41 seconds, it jumps back to the beginning.
[02:41:28.148 --> 02:41:31.890]  Like it's an auto, an auto completion is going to go back and do it again.
[02:41:31.930 --> 02:41:33.230]  How it does, how Twitter does it.
[02:41:33.551 --> 02:41:36.232]  And so you think, oh, I finished the video and I'm watching.
[02:41:36.252 --> 02:41:37.333]  I'm like, why does it keep cutting him off?
[02:41:37.373 --> 02:41:38.213]  And then I look at the time.
[02:41:38.233 --> 02:41:39.634]  I'm like, why is it not finishing the video?
[02:41:39.914 --> 02:41:40.915]  So I screen captured it.
[02:41:41.235 --> 02:41:42.115]  Here's the report.
[02:41:42.315 --> 02:41:43.056]  Let's go to it now.
[02:41:44.158 --> 02:41:51.906]  Hey everybody, Rob Dew here with News Supreme, and I just want to show you how Twitter is censoring information in live time.
[02:41:51.966 --> 02:41:53.028]  Now this is pretty crazy.
[02:41:53.068 --> 02:42:00.716]  Right now, Drew Brees is the number one subject trending on Twitter, and it has to do with what he said about kneeling and how the NFL should deal with it.
[02:42:01.156 --> 02:42:02.537]  In the wake of the George Floyd killing.
[02:42:02.897 --> 02:42:06.259]  And we have a minute 44 second clip from Yahoo Finance.
[02:42:06.519 --> 02:42:09.400]  This clip goes to 41 seconds and stops every time.
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:12.522]  You don't get to really hear what Drew Brees says.
[02:42:12.942 --> 02:42:15.143]  So I'm going to play you the three times in a row.
[02:42:15.263 --> 02:42:16.123]  It jumps back.
[02:42:16.604 --> 02:42:17.884]  It doesn't let him finish his sentence.
[02:42:17.904 --> 02:42:22.426]  And then I'm going to play the version that I grabbed off Yahoo Finance off their Twitter account.
[02:42:22.446 --> 02:42:24.207]  The full minute 44 seconds.
[02:42:24.247 --> 02:42:25.568]  You can see what he actually says.
[02:42:25.928 --> 02:42:29.370]  This is manipulation just to create more cancel culture fallout.
[02:42:29.771 --> 02:42:32.953]  And this is going to lead people not to want to say anything, not to speak out and shut up.
[02:42:32.973 --> 02:42:34.494]  Because that's what Twitter wants people to do.
[02:42:34.514 --> 02:42:37.055]  They want people to shut up unless they're saying the right thing.
[02:42:37.436 --> 02:42:40.658]  Jack Dorsey's treated like he's some Jedi and he knows everything.
[02:42:41.058 --> 02:42:45.381]  And all he is is a master manipulator and he's taking you for a fool.
[02:42:45.701 --> 02:42:46.301]  Here's the clip.
[02:42:47.282 --> 02:42:48.563]  Everyone is looking back now at
[02:42:48.993 --> 02:42:51.354]  I'm curious how you think the NFL will and should respond to that.
[02:42:51.414 --> 02:42:53.315]  And of course, you're such a leader in the league.
[02:42:53.415 --> 02:42:57.377]  What is your responsibility as a leader in times like this for the rest of your teammates and players in the league?
[02:43:14.537 --> 02:43:21.667]  Well, I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country.
[02:43:22.287 --> 02:43:29.157]  Let me just tell you what I see or what I feel when the National Anthem is played and when I look at
[02:43:30.595 --> 02:43:31.496]  So there it is right there.
[02:43:31.956 --> 02:43:34.799]  It just stops and it goes back to the beginning of the clip.
[02:43:35.099 --> 02:43:39.443]  I'm not going to make you sit through the two more times that it's on that video, but you can go watch it for yourself.
[02:43:39.803 --> 02:43:42.706]  But now we're going to play the full screen version of him.
[02:43:42.726 --> 02:43:46.129]  This is the full minute 44 that I downloaded right off their Twitter site.
[02:43:46.149 --> 02:43:47.370]  And you can see what he actually says.
[02:43:47.711 --> 02:43:49.933]  And then we'll come back and get John's opinion on this.
[02:43:49.973 --> 02:43:50.213]  Go ahead.
[02:43:50.233 --> 02:43:54.257]  Everyone is looking back now.
[02:43:54.830 --> 02:43:57.191]  I'm curious how you think the NFL will and should respond to that.
[02:43:57.251 --> 02:43:58.592]  And of course, you're such a leader in the league.
[02:43:58.612 --> 02:44:03.195]  What is your responsibility as a leader in times like this for the rest of your teammates and players in the league?
[02:44:20.373 --> 02:44:27.956]  Well, I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country.
[02:44:28.116 --> 02:44:31.978]  Let me just tell you what I see or what I feel.
[02:44:32.719 --> 02:44:52.705]  When the national anthem is played and when I look at the flag of the United States, I envision my two grandfathers who fought for this country during World War II, one in the Army and one in the Marine Corps, both risking their lives to protect our country and to try to make our country and this world a better place.
[02:44:53.465 --> 02:44:56.526]  So every time I stand with my hand over my heart,
[02:44:57.285 --> 02:44:59.846]  Looking at that flag and singing the national anthem.
[02:45:00.326 --> 02:45:01.267]  That's what I think about.
[02:45:01.627 --> 02:45:03.428]  And in many cases, it brings me to tears.
[02:45:04.088 --> 02:45:06.289]  Thinking about all that has been sacrificed.
[02:45:06.429 --> 02:45:12.772]  Not just those in the military, but for that matter, those throughout the civil rights movements of the 60s.
[02:45:13.372 --> 02:45:18.254]  And everyone and all that has been endured by so many people up until this point.
[02:45:18.815 --> 02:45:21.256]  And is everything right with our country right now?
[02:45:21.496 --> 02:45:22.556]  No, it's not.
[02:45:23.036 --> 02:45:24.197]  We still have a long way to go.
[02:45:24.798 --> 02:45:30.648]  But I think what you do by standing there and showing respect to the flag with your hand over your heart is it shows unity.
[02:45:31.269 --> 02:45:33.252]  It shows that we are all in this together.
[02:45:33.874 --> 02:45:34.835]  We can all do better.
[02:45:34.855 --> 02:45:37.240]  And that we are all part of the solution.
[02:45:38.703 --> 02:45:50.548]  Now for the life of me, I can't figure out why they would want to censor that answer other than to stir up racial division to just focus on, I'm never going to defend anyone who doesn't stand for the flag.
[02:45:50.588 --> 02:45:59.971]  Here's a guy who gave $5 million for the coronavirus fake pandemic, but he still gave it, so he believes in a lot of this stuff that goes on, but he has refused to walk back his stance.
[02:45:59.991 --> 02:46:04.293]  He was asked again by Fox News, and he said, no, I'm standing by it.
[02:46:04.913 --> 02:46:10.197]  John Rapport, it's not a big issue, but it is weird how Twitter is censoring these videos to only show part of them.
[02:46:10.217 --> 02:46:11.178]  Have you ever seen this before?
[02:46:12.178 --> 02:46:13.980]  No, I never saw that before.
[02:46:14.981 --> 02:46:22.426]  I mean, they knock it off at the crucial moment when he's saying, but let me explain this to you.
[02:46:23.407 --> 02:46:26.929]  Let me tell you what this is actually all about, why I feel this way.
[02:46:26.949 --> 02:46:31.913]  And then his remarks, you know, for anybody watching him,
[02:46:32.875 --> 02:46:40.357]  Who's in a reasonable frame of mind is going to say, okay, I understand exactly what he's saying.
[02:46:40.858 --> 02:46:44.759]  I see where he's coming from, whether you agree with him or you don't agree with him.
[02:46:46.199 --> 02:46:46.660]  There it is.
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:47.200]  Yeah.
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:48.400]  And now it's middle of the road.
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:53.102]  When you chop it off, when you chop it off, okay, now it's a whole different story.
[02:46:53.822 --> 02:46:56.363]  Now it's like, okay, let's nail this guy.
[02:46:56.703 --> 02:47:00.324]  Let's make him an object of scorn, attack him, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:47:00.819 --> 02:47:01.500]  And it jumps back.
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:04.804]  You can see on the screen it jumps back at 41 seconds.
[02:47:04.864 --> 02:47:13.033]  I do it three times in a row just because I wanted to make sure that it was actually happening before I made a big deal about it because it's literally a center of the road comment.
[02:47:13.073 --> 02:47:17.498]  But they're trying to take that and turn it into something that they could turn into more racial division.
[02:47:17.558 --> 02:47:20.322]  Here's a guy who's one of the premier quarterbacks in the league.
[02:47:21.142 --> 02:47:24.303]  And, you know, he does good for his community.
[02:47:24.383 --> 02:47:28.064]  He loves New Orleans, which is, you know, got a high black population.
[02:47:28.324 --> 02:47:29.525]  So I don't think the guy's racist.
[02:47:29.665 --> 02:47:31.265]  He plays a lot of black guys on his team.
[02:47:31.625 --> 02:47:39.228]  I don't think this guy's a racist, but they're trying to turn that into, oh, he hates Colin Kaepernick because this guy wanted to wear pig socks and kneel during the national anthem.
[02:47:41.168 --> 02:47:49.851]  And maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right, but my sense is that whoever this guy is right there, who's starting to ask him the question,
[02:47:50.862 --> 02:47:58.767]  He's hoping to bait Drew Brees into the kind of answer that's going to keep scorn on Brees' head.
[02:47:59.867 --> 02:48:02.849]  How are you going to be the leader?
[02:48:03.209 --> 02:48:06.471]  He already knows how Brees is going to answer the question.
[02:48:07.231 --> 02:48:09.953]  He already knows what the response is going to be.
[02:48:10.393 --> 02:48:13.515]  And he's kind of thinking, oh yeah, this is going to be interesting.
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:16.902]  Right, we got to dredge it up and maybe Twitter can help me do this.
[02:48:17.222 --> 02:48:22.526]  It did say, guys, if you can pull up that little shot again of the tweet, it does say something at the bottom like Twitter Live Cut.
[02:48:22.786 --> 02:48:29.511]  I wonder if that has something to do with it where Twitter gets to come in and kind of oversee the media because it's not something I've seen.
[02:48:29.531 --> 02:48:35.755]  It says Twitter Media Studio Live Cut, but maybe that's something they took out of the Twitter studio, but it's a full clip and it won't play.
[02:48:36.315 --> 02:48:36.915]  By itself.
[02:48:36.975 --> 02:48:39.336]  You have to actually download the full clip to see it.
[02:48:39.356 --> 02:48:40.476]  And this is manipulation.
[02:48:40.796 --> 02:48:51.238]  I think we're going to see going forward, end of the election, Trump's going to get a sentence out and then it's going to repeat and people aren't going to actually look at the video because the video doesn't show up the time code unless you put your cursor over it.
[02:48:51.538 --> 02:48:55.499]  So if your cursor is not over it, you're not even going to see that the media has been manipulated.
[02:48:55.819 --> 02:49:01.140]  And this is sort of the weird CIA type mind control tactics that they're going to keep implementing as we go forward.
[02:49:01.180 --> 02:49:03.500]  So we really have to be on the lookout for stuff like this.
[02:49:05.506 --> 02:49:07.167]  Well, we see this all over the place.
[02:49:07.427 --> 02:49:10.008]  A video goes up on YouTube.
[02:49:10.188 --> 02:49:13.549]  It's controversial by the standards of YouTube.
[02:49:13.589 --> 02:49:16.770]  So they take it down and they could disappear as if it never was there.
[02:49:17.390 --> 02:49:18.131]  It vanishes.
[02:49:19.051 --> 02:49:26.934]  In some cases, they tell you, you know, you violated the fictional community standards or whatever that means.
[02:49:27.594 --> 02:49:33.336]  In other cases, they just take it down without telling the person who put it up there in the beginning that it's taken down.
[02:49:34.372 --> 02:49:35.353]  And it's all arbitrary.
[02:49:35.793 --> 02:49:36.533]  It's all arbitrary.
[02:49:36.573 --> 02:49:39.335]  It's all by whatever the censor feels like doing that day.
[02:49:40.976 --> 02:49:56.785]  Yes, although you can pretty much predict that if, for example, what I was saying earlier in the show about vaccines was made into a YouTube video, it'd probably last a couple of days at the most because I've had them taken down before.
[02:49:57.622 --> 02:49:57.982]  We're good to go.
[02:50:21.708 --> 02:50:25.654]  Uh, and we're just censoring it on their behalf, so we're psychotic.
[02:50:25.735 --> 02:50:26.696]  It's a straw community.
[02:50:26.716 --> 02:50:27.457]  Go along with us.
[02:50:27.798 --> 02:50:29.881]  Instead of the straw man, we have the straw community.
[02:50:30.221 --> 02:50:32.084]  Now the straw community doesn't agree with this.
[02:50:33.143 --> 02:50:37.705]  So the straw community says, no, we have to get rid of this bit of information because we don't like it.
[02:50:37.765 --> 02:50:41.986]  Even those respected medical sources that are saying that these are doctors that have been in practice for years.
[02:50:42.206 --> 02:50:43.367]  We're going to take their video down.
[02:50:43.707 --> 02:50:45.047]  I knew that video was going to get pulled.
[02:50:45.127 --> 02:50:47.268]  I could, and you can almost tell you're exactly right.
[02:50:47.288 --> 02:50:48.929]  You can almost tell when these videos are going to go.
[02:50:49.229 --> 02:50:52.090]  And so we grab them, put them up on band.video for people to see for free.
[02:50:52.130 --> 02:50:53.891]  So that's why we need your support out there.
[02:50:54.151 --> 02:50:55.231]  Absolutely, man.
[02:50:55.791 --> 02:50:57.272]  Band video is fantastic.
[02:50:57.552 --> 02:50:57.812]  It is.
[02:50:57.852 --> 02:50:59.434]  And John, we appreciate you coming on.
[02:50:59.734 --> 02:51:01.376]  We appreciate everybody out there supporting us.
[02:51:01.396 --> 02:51:02.597]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:51:02.637 --> 02:51:05.780]  We have an amazing sale going on for the rest of the week.
[02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:08.303]  I don't know how long it's going to last because some things keep going out of stock.
[02:51:08.323 --> 02:51:10.045]  So InfoWarsStore.com is where you can go.
[02:51:10.385 --> 02:51:11.046]  Check everything out.
[02:51:11.066 --> 02:51:11.786]  Thank you for watching.
[02:51:11.806 --> 02:51:12.347]  I'm Rob Due.
[02:51:12.547 --> 02:51:14.509]  You can't follow me on Twitter because I've been censored.
[02:51:14.810 --> 02:51:15.911]  War Room's coming up next.
[02:51:27.634 --> 02:51:30.895]  We told you what was going to happen, and it did.
[02:51:31.335 --> 02:51:33.656]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[02:51:33.996 --> 02:51:37.637]  Band.Video.
[02:51:43.679 --> 02:51:48.541]  Listen, I had my lawyer on the phone, my family lawyer, really nice guy, smart guy this morning.
[02:51:49.541 --> 02:51:55.203]  He said, so you really... His mother's a nutritionist, retired.
[02:51:55.998 --> 02:51:58.946]  He goes, so you are taking your zinc and taking your vitamin D3 and taking all this?
[02:51:59.007 --> 02:51:59.628]  And I said, yeah.
[02:52:00.471 --> 02:52:03.339]  On a regular basis because they're called essential.
[02:52:04.991 --> 02:52:11.356]  You know, the media's like, Jones claims he's got a COVID-19 cure selling zinc pills that I've been selling for years.
[02:52:11.416 --> 02:52:12.297]  No, it's not a cure.
[02:52:13.137 --> 02:52:15.319]  Oxygen is not a cure for asphyxiation.
[02:52:15.759 --> 02:52:17.120]  You just asphyxiate if you don't have it.
[02:52:17.260 --> 02:52:18.741]  Somebody already hung you because you're a traitor.
[02:52:18.801 --> 02:52:20.863]  Well, no, oxygen's not going to help because your brain's dead.
[02:52:20.883 --> 02:52:25.827]  But they play these little games like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you say, you say your krill oil has D3 in it.
[02:52:26.207 --> 02:52:28.829]  Oh, because they play on the ignorance of the public.
[02:52:28.869 --> 02:52:33.833]  Folks, I take D3 because it makes me have more virility than when I was 16 years old.
[02:52:34.033 --> 02:52:37.015]  I take X2 because it makes me younger and stronger.
[02:52:37.216 --> 02:52:38.176]  And of course it's essential.
[02:52:38.256 --> 02:52:38.757]  And it's pure.
[02:52:39.077 --> 02:52:43.640]  I take Turbo Force when I gotta go to a rally or do some event and I'm already exhausted and already worked 10 hours.
[02:52:43.660 --> 02:52:45.602]  And I have trouble going to sleep and wish I didn't take it.
[02:52:45.722 --> 02:52:46.403]  It's too strong.
[02:52:46.523 --> 02:52:48.564]  It's the strongest clean 10-hour energy you're gonna find.
[02:52:48.584 --> 02:52:49.445]  That's what it's formulated for.
[02:52:49.605 --> 02:52:50.786]  The big sale of last week.
[02:52:50.987 --> 02:52:52.709]  A lot of stuff sold out, so I had to partially end.
[02:52:52.729 --> 02:52:55.452]  But we have the Memorial Day special that's extended, but not much longer.
[02:52:55.492 --> 02:52:57.134]  I've just been so busy, I haven't come up with new specials.
[02:52:57.174 --> 02:52:58.795]  This is the biggest special of the year so far.
[02:52:58.856 --> 02:52:59.496]  Take advantage of it.
[02:52:59.636 --> 02:53:01.018]  Super Mel Vitality is amazing.
[02:53:01.038 --> 02:53:01.859]  40% off.
[02:53:01.919 --> 02:53:02.960]  Knockout is incredible.
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:03.461]  Sleep Aid.
[02:53:03.581 --> 02:53:04.162]  I designed that. 50%.
[02:53:04.722 --> 02:53:05.503]  We're good to go.
[02:53:24.022 --> 02:53:26.463]  Chill Force, amazing, 60% off.
[02:53:26.563 --> 02:53:29.304]  Emrix Essentials Hand Sanitizer Combo, three different great scents.
[02:53:29.324 --> 02:53:32.766]  8-Pack Power Stack, the best deal we've got at cost, 70% off.
[02:53:32.806 --> 02:53:34.287]  DNA Force Plus, 50% off.
[02:53:34.407 --> 02:53:36.067]  That's the most important thing, other than the next two.
[02:53:36.087 --> 02:53:37.228]  They're right up there at the top together.
[02:53:37.248 --> 02:53:38.168]  I can't decide which one's better.
[02:53:38.468 --> 02:53:39.649]  They're both too good.
[02:53:39.709 --> 02:53:40.909]  Living Defense, plus 50% off.
[02:53:40.949 --> 02:53:43.230]  Limited Edition Info Wars Face Mask, $9.95.
[02:53:43.330 --> 02:53:46.212]  If you gotta do the whole clown dance, I'd look at the word outlier.
[02:53:46.232 --> 02:53:47.592]  Triiodine's gonna sell out soon.
[02:53:47.632 --> 02:53:48.893]  Dazzo Beats, 40% off.
[02:53:48.973 --> 02:53:51.094]  And a bunch of other stuff is about to sell out as well.
[02:53:51.394 --> 02:53:52.575]  Again, you need water.
[02:53:52.895 --> 02:53:54.416]  You need air to live.
[02:53:54.516 --> 02:53:55.156]  You need food.
[02:53:55.196 --> 02:53:55.836]  What's in food?
[02:53:55.896 --> 02:53:56.897]  Vitamins and minerals.
[02:53:57.377 --> 02:54:03.820]  Well, if you can get concentrated, high-quality versions of those key elements, that's what you do at InfoWarsaw.com, and it funds the InfoWar.

[02:55:32.208 --> 02:55:35.469]  When do you think the people should be able to, like, talk again?
[02:55:35.489 --> 02:55:36.649]  The deep person?
[02:55:36.829 --> 02:55:38.810]  Oh yeah, that's a good question.
[02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:42.271]  Well, Alex Jones at least has Infowars.com.
[02:55:42.291 --> 02:55:44.192]  He can do his own thing and people go to that.
[02:55:44.252 --> 02:55:45.772]  And Gavin's got a show still.
[02:55:45.812 --> 02:55:46.092]  Does he?
[02:55:46.272 --> 02:55:48.133]  Yeah, you know, as someone who's kind of
[02:55:48.533 --> 02:55:52.556]  It doesn't make any sense, because that means you're right all the time.
[02:55:52.936 --> 02:55:55.878]  Like, if you're only defending the things that you believe in...
[02:56:10.347 --> 02:56:10.687]  Yeah.
[02:56:10.727 --> 02:56:12.149]  You write all the time about everything?
[02:56:12.169 --> 02:56:21.656]  But I have to defend the people who say things that are even atrocious and that I can't, I would never get on board with because that's what free speech is.
[02:56:21.676 --> 02:56:21.796]  Yes.
[02:56:21.816 --> 02:56:27.861]  Otherwise, and like you said, it is that slippery slope of who gets to be the arbiter of what is said.
[02:56:27.881 --> 02:56:29.783]  Right, and what are your guidelines?
[02:56:29.803 --> 02:56:31.985]  Alex Jones is funnier than Andy Kaufman's ever been.
[02:56:32.445 --> 02:56:34.567]  Alex Jones is f***ing hilarious often.
[02:56:34.687 --> 02:56:37.109]  Did you see the whole that he's Bill Hicks?
[02:56:37.569 --> 02:56:37.970]  Yeah, no.
[02:56:38.010 --> 02:56:38.710]  Conspiracy.
[02:56:39.711 --> 02:56:40.931]  I went down that rabbit hole.
[02:56:40.951 --> 02:56:41.992]  That's the silliest shit ever.
[02:56:42.012 --> 02:56:43.292]  I know, but there are videos.
[02:56:43.692 --> 02:56:49.673]  But he had one thing we're talking about, like if it's between his family starving or eating his neighbor.
[02:56:49.693 --> 02:56:50.373]  Oh, I know.
[02:56:50.393 --> 02:56:51.433]  He's like, I'll eat your ass.
[02:56:51.453 --> 02:56:53.134]  I thought... And so it became this giant... Come on.
[02:56:53.994 --> 02:56:55.374]  I will eat your ass!
[02:56:55.514 --> 02:56:58.355]  Do you don't think there's entertainment value in him saying he's going to eat his neighbor?
[02:56:58.395 --> 02:56:58.955]  Stop my dumpster fire!
[02:56:59.335 --> 02:56:59.555]  Right.
[02:56:59.795 --> 02:57:03.096]  But there's something to that, like to stop that and ban that.
[02:57:04.210 --> 02:57:19.937]  You're not stopping anyone from anything bad by not having Alex do this entertaining thing about eating his neighbor.
[02:57:19.957 --> 02:57:21.118]  You're not saving anybody.
[02:57:21.178 --> 02:57:22.118]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:57:24.848 --> 02:57:25.868]  Like, what are you doing?
[02:57:25.928 --> 02:57:27.669]  Like, what is he doing that's so awful?
[02:57:28.349 --> 02:57:30.889]  I don't know how to fix any of it.
[02:57:31.189 --> 02:57:32.049]  It's entertaining.
[02:57:32.689 --> 02:57:35.690]  Like, why is it only acceptable if you have some kind of entertainment?
[02:57:35.710 --> 02:57:45.792]  Because there's so many rap videos that you could watch that I enjoy, but they're talking about shooting people and robbing people, and it's everywhere on YouTube!
[02:57:45.872 --> 02:57:47.172]  It's so prevalent!
[02:57:47.452 --> 02:57:49.012]  And somehow or another, that's okay.
[02:57:49.732 --> 02:57:53.073]  Like, it's f***ing weird what's allowed and what's not allowed.
[02:58:06.747 --> 02:58:07.288]  I will eat you.
[02:58:07.628 --> 02:58:09.809]  I will eat your ass.
[02:58:09.909 --> 02:58:11.350]  My children aren't going hungry.
[02:58:11.530 --> 02:58:11.990]  I'll do it.
[02:58:12.230 --> 02:58:13.411]  I'll drink your blood.
[02:58:14.051 --> 02:58:17.073]  And I'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors.
[02:58:17.313 --> 02:58:20.955]  You think I like... Size it up, I'm gonna haul him up by a chain.
[02:58:21.495 --> 02:58:25.037]  Top his ass up, size it up, I'm gonna haul him up by a chain.
[02:58:25.117 --> 02:58:26.138]  Top, top, top, top.
[02:58:26.178 --> 02:58:27.158]  Barbecue your ass.
[02:58:28.259 --> 02:58:28.499]  Flat.
[02:58:29.855 --> 02:58:34.199]  I will cook your ass up so fast, I'll tell him, boy, I killed a cow out back, baby.
[02:58:34.979 --> 02:58:36.560]  You think Christ would eat somebody?
[02:58:36.601 --> 02:58:37.281]  He would never do that.
[02:58:37.601 --> 02:58:37.962]  I will.
[02:58:38.242 --> 02:58:40.964]  I'm ready to hang them up, gut them and skin them and chop them up.
[02:58:59.749 --> 02:59:02.697]  That's why I want the globalists to know, I will eat your ass first.
[02:59:02.997 --> 02:59:06.186]  I swear to God, if it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna get my hands around your throat.
