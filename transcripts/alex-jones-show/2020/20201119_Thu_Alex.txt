[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:18.480]  This is stunning, heartbreaking, infuriating, and the most unpatriotic acts I can even imagine for people in this country to have participated in in any way, shape, or form.
[00:00:19.278 --> 00:00:23.860]  And I want the American public to know right now that we will not be intimidated.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:32.023]  American patriots are fed up with the corruption from the local level to the highest level of our government.
[00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:34.364]  And we are going to take this country back.
[00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:36.605]  We are not going to be intimidated.
[00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:38.306]  We are not going to back down.
[00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.647]  We are going to clean this mess up now.
[00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:44.408]  President Trump won by a landslide.
[00:00:44.508 --> 00:00:45.609]  We are going to prove it.
[00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.411]  And we are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote for freedom.
[00:00:51.832 --> 00:00:57.014]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:00.307 --> 00:01:04.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us in these very, very dark times.
[00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:06.332]  That is the bad news.
[00:01:06.352 --> 00:01:08.573]  The good news is humanity is awakening.
[00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:15.679]  Again, thank you for joining us on this Thursday, October 19th, 2020 transmission.
[00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:18.101]  We have Right Side Broadcasting's live feed.
[00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:25.967]  And as soon as Giuliani launches this press conference, Rudolph Giuliani, Trump's main lawyer, we will go right to it.
[00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.629]  It's called the Path to Victory press conference.
[00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:29.790]  We have a path to victory.
[00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.051]  We're good to go.
[00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:50.547]  All right.
[00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.674]  So Owen Troyer is in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:10.314]  He's monitoring the press conference.
[00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:12.895]  And so, Owen, break in and take over.
[00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:15.336]  As soon as that press conference goes up, we're going to be carrying that.
[00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:25.079]  I've done a lot of preparation here, though, on how to stop the Great Reset and how to stop a new dark age that once they've got it in place, it's very hard to reverse.
[00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.319]  And so I've really thought about this.
[00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:28.199]  I've focused on it.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.580]  And I have a plan.
[00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:43.476]  That we the people could implement, even if Trump is not in office, through the state legislatures and through other governments around the world, particularly Eastern Europe and African countries that are aware of what the IMF and World Bank are doing.
[00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:46.897]  This is all an IMF, World Bank, mega banker takeover.
[00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:50.077]  I've already researched it, already read the books written by these people.
[00:02:50.918 --> 00:02:54.539]  But now they've made even more statements admitting it is a banking takeover.
[00:02:55.339 --> 00:03:00.963]  Where they're going to have the government nationalize all businesses and come into your life and control you.
[00:03:00.983 --> 00:03:08.468]  This is a corporate fascist takeover, but using, again, communism at the grassroots level.
[00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:18.174]  And these very bankers that bankrupt us, they are then above the law and can do whatever they want, whenever they want, and are totally tax exempt.
[00:03:18.694 --> 00:03:21.917]  Some of the headlines that tie all this together that I'm going to be covering are
[00:03:23.064 --> 00:03:28.907]  South Australia enters another lockdown after just 36 new coronavirus infections, and this is the key.
[00:03:28.947 --> 00:03:33.270]  They say no one can ever come out again until no one ever has it again.
[00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.031]  That's totally impossible.
[00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.953]  Once a new flu virus or cold virus is out there, it never goes away.
[00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:40.994]  And now, of course, there's new mutations.
[00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:46.197]  This is just the end of civilization teaching you you've got to hide in your house like Chicken Little.
[00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:52.562]  New strains of COVID could render vaccines completely useless and two dangerous new strains are already spreading.
[00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:56.525]  That's all being reported because it's a problem they never want to be fixed.
[00:03:56.565 --> 00:03:58.147]  And I found a clip of Klaus Schwab.
[00:03:59.457 --> 00:04:10.721]  In June of this year, he's running this whole operation for Bill Gates out of the Davos Group, saying, we can never come back to normal, and we can never open back up again until it is all eradicated.
[00:04:11.121 --> 00:04:14.322]  We don't know the solution, so life as you know it is over.
[00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:18.543]  There will be major poverty and war, and people will be very angry.
[00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:25.586]  So to save a million people, if you count all the COVID deaths worldwide, we'll kill tens of millions of starvation and have a global collapse.
[00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:32.632]  For them, and they go, don't worry though, we're going to loan you money out of nowhere and own everything you've got.
[00:04:32.652 --> 00:04:34.372]  It's a very good idea.
[00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:42.896]  Meanwhile, top pathologist claims coronavirus is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public.
[00:04:43.277 --> 00:04:47.038]  He's the most respected pathologist in Canada.
[00:04:47.358 --> 00:04:54.762]  He was in a parliamentary Zoom meeting between the state governments, the provinces, and the federal government, and just said, look, it's the biggest hoax ever.
[00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:56.114]  Guess what?
[00:04:56.514 --> 00:04:59.356]  YouTube and Facebook and Twitter are now blocking his video.
[00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:03.597]  Even the top government advisor has a soul.
[00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:11.841]  Says greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public and just totally abusing people's confidence in the medical system.
[00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:13.042]  Trust the scientist.
[00:05:13.482 --> 00:05:14.922]  That means Fauci and Bill Gates.
[00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:17.324]  Look at this one.
[00:05:17.344 --> 00:05:19.905]  New York Times says Great Reset is a conspiracy theory.
[00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:23.286]  On same day, World Economic Forum celebrates it.
[00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:24.907]  So that's always the tactic is
[00:05:26.394 --> 00:05:27.394]  World government's good for you.
[00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:27.995]  We don't want it.
[00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:28.915]  Okay, it doesn't exist.
[00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:31.216]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:33.157]  Man dies from falling ten feet from ladder.
[00:05:33.557 --> 00:05:35.018]  Doctors declare COVID-19 killed him.
[00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:40.080]  And now they're raiding medical doctors that speak out against the tyranny in Germany with SWAT teams.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.001]  We have video of that, dramatic video, coming up.
[00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:43.522]  Stay with us.
[00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:44.102]  We are live.
[00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:47.912]  Thank you for joining us on this November 19th Global Transmission.
[00:05:47.992 --> 00:05:48.712]  It is Thursday.
[00:05:48.732 --> 00:05:50.432]  Owen Schroer is in Austin, Texas.
[00:05:50.472 --> 00:05:51.872]  He'll be hosting most of the transmission.
[00:05:52.412 --> 00:05:58.714]  But I'll be back in the fourth hour today with Jay Dyer in studio, Nick Fuentes, Ali Alexander.
[00:05:59.254 --> 00:06:06.195]  Here in about 45 minutes, I'm going to go back down to the Georgia Capitol, where they've been finding massive evidence of fraud in this election.
[00:06:06.255 --> 00:06:06.975]  Ballots hidden.
[00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:09.576]  And in every case, the ballots flip back.
[00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:11.799]  To Trump, not to Biden.
[00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:20.194]  And Giuliani, Rulof Giuliani, the White House's chief lawyer, is set to hold a passive victory press conference any minute.
[00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:29.967]  And as soon as that begins to take place, we will go live to it with Owen Schroer.
[00:06:30.308 --> 00:06:31.748]  But I want listeners to understand something.
[00:06:32.388 --> 00:06:35.949]  We have some particularly massive news here.
[00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:38.989]  Folks know that we're next year's news today, okay?
[00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:39.829]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:48.331]  I've really been focusing, historically and currently, and looking into the future, on what needs to be done, and I have a plan.
[00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:54.994]  And if you want to get out of the straitjacket, if you want to get out of being a slave, it needs to be done right now.
[00:06:55.734 --> 00:06:59.697]  Okay, we have to start resisting and speaking out, getting very, very aggressive right now.
[00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:17.426]  We have to call out the people behind this, the people who orchestrated this, the fact that it's an organized criminal fraud to put the whole world into more debt and to put the middle class into debt to the IMF and World Bank, that the very central banks are bragging and putting out business perspectives on how much money they're going to make out of this.
[00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:26.117]  Just like when they would put in a government in Greece and plunge their economy, all the private jets would land coming in, buying up the private islands for themselves.
[00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:38.667]  We are being put into cardiac arrest financially so they can buy everything up, pennies on the dollar, bring in a cashless society, a medical tyranny, tracking system, social credit score.
[00:07:38.987 --> 00:07:40.288]  This is the big move.
[00:07:40.748 --> 00:07:43.751]  Everything from this point on just accelerates at light speed.
[00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:45.132]  I likened it last night.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:56.865]  On a very successful Twitter periscope feed I did with Ali Alexander had a couple hundred thousand people on it watching, as of last night, who knows what it is today, about climbing a mountain.
[00:07:56.905 --> 00:07:58.385]  You get to a mountain peak and it's a cliff.
[00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:01.467]  It took you a long time, you know, days to climb it.
[00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:06.269]  But when you jump off it and fall 10,000 feet, it just takes a minute or so to hit the bottom.
[00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:07.890]  We are in free fall now.
[00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.431]  Now we have a parachute that's called God.
[00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:11.611]  It's called us getting active.
[00:08:11.952 --> 00:08:14.313]  It's called us declaring our own independence and not complying.
[00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:18.495]  We're about a third of the way falling right now, and we're falling fast.
[00:08:19.235 --> 00:08:20.756]  So this is very, very serious.
[00:08:21.496 --> 00:08:25.118]  Owen Schroer, everything coming to a head, everything out in the open now.
[00:08:25.998 --> 00:08:29.040]  The enemy had to emerge at a certain point, and boy, are they not making their move, Owen.
[00:08:30.083 --> 00:08:38.745]  And Alex, it's so hard to decide what to have your focus on, what to keep your eye on, you know, what ball to follow, the bouncing balls.
[00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:43.246]  Is it the COVID hoax worldwide to establish a world government?
[00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:48.587]  Is it the complete theft, the complete rig of our elections that we have to fight to?
[00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:53.348]  And we're trying to fight both of these beasts, and the average American doesn't even see them.
[00:08:53.388 --> 00:08:59.270]  They don't even know that it's going on, and so we're here trying to get them to engage in this battle with us, and they can't even see
[00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.750]  The elephant in the room.
[00:09:01.271 --> 00:09:06.073]  It does appear that Trump's lawyers are now entering the press conference right now, Alex.
[00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:07.314]  The cameras have turned around.
[00:09:07.654 --> 00:09:16.558]  So let's go live in Washington, D.C., the Republican National Committee Center there as Trump's legal team is coming out.
[00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.439]  You can see, Alex, they have a little board there.
[00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:19.860]  You have Rudy Giuliani.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.040]  You have Sidney Powell.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:21.941]  You have Jenna Ellis.
[00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:24.442]  And Rudy Giuliani looks like he is going to lead us off.
[00:09:24.502 --> 00:09:25.042]  Good afternoon.
[00:09:27.023 --> 00:09:28.204]  And thank you very much for coming.
[00:09:29.549 --> 00:09:33.032]  This is representative of our legal team.
[00:09:33.853 --> 00:09:38.076]  We're representing President Trump and we're representing the Trump campaign.
[00:09:39.717 --> 00:09:53.809]  When I finish, Sidney Powell and then Jenna Ellis will follow me and we will present, in brief, the evidence that we've collected over the last, I guess it is two weeks.
[00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.733]  Also Joseph Jennifer, Victoria Tenzing are here with me.
[00:09:59.764 --> 00:10:05.728]  There are a lot more lawyers working on this, but we're the... I guess we're the... We're the senior lawyers.
[00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:08.589]  And Boris Epstein.
[00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:21.597]  So, I guess the best way to describe this is when we began our representation of the President, we certainly were confronted with a very anomalous set of results.
[00:10:22.618 --> 00:10:24.319]  The President way ahead on election night.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.661]  Seven or eight hundred thousand in Pennsylvania.
[00:10:28.704 --> 00:10:30.726]  Somehow, he lost Pennsylvania.
[00:10:31.686 --> 00:10:38.231]  We have statisticians willing to testify that that's almost statistically impossible to have happened in the period of time that it happened.
[00:10:39.192 --> 00:10:40.693]  But of course, that's just speculation.
[00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:52.461]  As we started investigating, both our investigations and the very patriotic and brave American citizens that have come forward are extraordinary.
[00:10:52.881 --> 00:10:57.985]  Extraordinary number of people, extraordinary number of witnesses, and what emerged very quickly is
[00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:01.740]  Because there's not a singular voter fraud in one state.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.302]  This pattern repeats itself in a number of states.
[00:11:06.162 --> 00:11:07.802]  Almost exactly the same pattern.
[00:11:08.743 --> 00:11:26.330]  Which, to any experienced investigator, prosecutor, would suggest that there was a plan from a centralized place to execute these various acts of voter fraud, specifically focused on big cities.
[00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:33.828]  And specifically focused on, as you would imagine, big cities controlled by Democrats.
[00:11:34.748 --> 00:11:39.989]  And particularly focused on big cities that have a long history of corruption.
[00:11:40.969 --> 00:11:45.231]  The number of voter fraud cases in Philadelphia could fill a library.
[00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:50.932]  Just a few weeks ago, there was a conviction for voter fraud, and one two weeks before that.
[00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.413]  And I've often said,
[00:11:56.053 --> 00:11:57.934]  I guess sarcastically, but it's true.
[00:11:58.554 --> 00:12:03.636]  The only surprise I would have found in this is if Philadelphia hadn't cheated in this election.
[00:12:04.416 --> 00:12:09.378]  Because for the last 60 years, they've cheated in just about every single election.
[00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:12.019]  You could say the same thing about Detroit.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.681]  Each one of these cities are cities that are controlled by Democrats.
[00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:18.041]  Which means they can get away with anything they want to do.
[00:12:19.182 --> 00:12:24.464]  It means they have a certain degree of control over, certainly control the election board completely.
[00:12:25.581 --> 00:12:37.285]  And they control law enforcement, and unfortunately, they have some friendly judges that will issue ridiculously irrational opinions just to come out in their favor.
[00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:39.365]  So let's start with the specifics.
[00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:41.306]  Pennsylvania.
[00:12:42.166 --> 00:12:51.909]  In Pennsylvania, the margin of victory now for Biden, which is not a victory, it's a fraud, is 69,140 votes.
[00:12:56.181 --> 00:13:12.229]  The reality is that we are now at a count of 682,770 ballots for which we have affidavits that there was no inspection of that ballot at the time that it was entered in the vote.
[00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:13.590]  It was a mail ballot.
[00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.472]  Mail ballots are particularly prone to fraud.
[00:13:18.152 --> 00:13:23.935]  We were warned about that by Jimmy Carter, President Jimmy Carter and Secretary Baker in a report
[00:13:24.944 --> 00:13:37.887]  About a dozen years ago, in which they said that mail balloting is particularly susceptible of fraud, that we should very carefully consider ever doing it, and that it can be taken advantage of.
[00:13:38.427 --> 00:13:43.689]  Justice Souter warned us of the same thing in a comment in an election law case.
[00:13:44.589 --> 00:13:52.971]  And even the New York Times wrote articles about how dangerous mail voting, mail-in voting was.
[00:13:53.966 --> 00:14:00.848]  And this is the first time we ever did it en masse, and I think we proved that all three are prophets.
[00:14:01.608 --> 00:14:19.294]  It's not only susceptible to fraud, it is easily susceptible to fraud, particularly if you have a plan or scheme which sounds eerily similar to what Joe Biden told us a few days before the election, that he had the best voter fraud team in the world.
[00:14:21.204 --> 00:14:21.845]  Well, they were good.
[00:14:22.305 --> 00:14:28.510]  I don't know that they were that good because they made significant mistakes, like all crooks do, and we caught them.
[00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:33.033]  One of them was pushing out Republican inspectors.
[00:14:34.154 --> 00:14:45.923]  Every state, almost every civilized country, even Tanzania and places you wouldn't think of, have rules about inspectors
[00:14:47.094 --> 00:14:48.715]  Particularly for mail-in ballots.
[00:14:49.175 --> 00:14:50.696]  And why particularly for mail-in ballots?
[00:14:50.976 --> 00:14:54.438]  Because they can more easily be defrauded and you can't check them.
[00:14:54.478 --> 00:15:08.665]  I don't want to give radio stations and TV stations a chance to either break away or carry this because we're gonna go ahead and go commercial free during this press conference but we'll still fire tones for radio stations to play their ads but InfoWars Network is going commercial free right now.
[00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:09.945]  Back to Rudolph Giuliani.
[00:15:11.406 --> 00:15:13.327]  And the precinct in which you're voting.
[00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:15.428]  You fill out your name and your address
[00:15:16.351 --> 00:15:16.891]  And you sign it.
[00:15:18.853 --> 00:15:22.555]  You then use an inner envelope and you put the ballot inside the inner envelope.
[00:15:23.835 --> 00:15:25.176]  You seal it all and you send it in.
[00:15:26.377 --> 00:15:44.928]  When it's being counted, almost invariably in the United States, up until the mass cheating that went on in this election, a Republican and a Democrat inspector, as well as others if there are other parties, is allowed to watch the unsealing of this ballot.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.281]  Used to go on all over America when we conducted honest elections.
[00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:58.025]  Because the only time you can ever find out if it's a fraudulent ballot is when it is looked at.
[00:15:59.805 --> 00:16:04.467]  The minute you approve this, it's thrown away, gone for eternity.
[00:16:05.268 --> 00:16:06.448]  The only thing left is to vote.
[00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:09.289]  That could have been Mickey Mouse.
[00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:10.950]  That could have been a dead person.
[00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.311]  That could have been not filled out properly.
[00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:15.252]  That could have been
[00:16:16.385 --> 00:16:17.846]  The same person 30 times.
[00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:25.431]  That could have been, and all these things have happened by the way, that could have been nothing filled out.
[00:16:26.472 --> 00:16:26.993]  We never know.
[00:16:28.013 --> 00:16:39.521]  So, for example, the recount being done in Georgia will tell us nothing because these fraudulent ballots will just be counted again because they wouldn't supply the signatures to match the ballots.
[00:16:40.522 --> 00:16:46.006]  So it means nothing to have counted these ballots because, for example, in Pennsylvania,
[00:16:46.932 --> 00:16:56.758]  Where we have probably our most precise evidence, 682,770 of these ballots were cast, put in, and they weren't inspected.
[00:16:58.339 --> 00:17:01.001]  Which renders them ballots that are null and void.
[00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:05.784]  Cannot be counted, have to be removed from the vote.
[00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:07.485]  Why?
[00:17:08.726 --> 00:17:13.389]  For several reasons, not the least of which is, that was basically
[00:17:14.674 --> 00:17:16.855]  Only one of two places in the state where it was done.
[00:17:18.155 --> 00:17:22.576]  So in the other parts of the state, there was a legitimate inspection of the ballots.
[00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:35.940]  So if you have two different standards in different parts of the state, one favoring one part of the state, the other disfavoring the other part of the state, that's a classic violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.721]  Bush v. Gore being the most recent case that teaches that.
[00:17:44.992 --> 00:17:48.074]  That's not the only fraud that went on in Pennsylvania.
[00:17:48.835 --> 00:17:56.421]  All of the other frauds carried out in the other states by the Democrat bosses happened there as well.
[00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:10.892]  For example, if you made a mistake in that ballot and you lived in Philadelphia or in Pittsburgh, you were allowed to fix the mistake.
[00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:20.882]  But if you lived in the, what would be considered more Republican or Trump parts of the state, you were given no such right.
[00:18:22.423 --> 00:18:26.044]  One of our plaintiffs, Mr. Henry, cast a absentee ballot.
[00:18:27.104 --> 00:18:34.167]  And he failed to put it in the secure envelope inside.
[00:18:34.807 --> 00:18:37.068]  He just put it in open, naked.
[00:18:38.348 --> 00:18:40.889]  That ballot was cast aside.
[00:18:41.522 --> 00:18:42.422]  Because it was invalid.
[00:18:42.963 --> 00:18:47.945]  Because that breaks the privacy of the vote.
[00:18:49.485 --> 00:18:59.090]  In Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia, if they noticed that there wasn't an inner envelope, they'd contact the voter and allow him to vote again.
[00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.150]  Or if he didn't fill it out completely.
[00:19:01.991 --> 00:19:04.272]  Or if he made a mistake and didn't sign his full name.
[00:19:05.052 --> 00:19:06.073]  He was allowed to cure it.
[00:19:06.853 --> 00:19:09.374]  There is no such provision under the law of Pennsylvania.
[00:19:10.245 --> 00:19:19.788]  The Democrat Secretary of State made that up in order to maximize the votes in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and to minimize the votes in the other parts of the state.
[00:19:20.229 --> 00:19:27.271]  Clearly illegal, clearly voter fraud, easily provable, hundreds of witnesses, maybe thousands.
[00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:35.474]  We have, to give you another example, we have 17,000 provisional ballots cast in Pittsburgh.
[00:19:37.034 --> 00:19:38.475]  Do you know what a provisional ballot is?
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.360]  Provisional ballot usually happens this way.
[00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:43.941]  And about 15 of the 17,000 happen this way.
[00:19:44.561 --> 00:19:47.842]  You walk in and you say, I'm here to vote today.
[00:19:50.803 --> 00:19:52.383]  Oh, Mr. Giuliani, you already voted.
[00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:54.284]  I did?
[00:19:55.124 --> 00:19:55.904]  I don't remember voting.
[00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.065]  Oh, yes, yes, you cast an absentee ballot.
[00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:00.725]  No, I didn't.
[00:20:01.185 --> 00:20:01.605]  Yes, you did.
[00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:02.145]  No, I didn't.
[00:20:02.346 --> 00:20:02.766]  Yes, you did.
[00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:06.827]  So why does that happen 17,000 times in Pittsburgh?
[00:20:09.284 --> 00:20:14.108]  People walked in thinking, actually 15,000 to be precise.
[00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:27.080]  Why did it happen 15,000 times that people in Pittsburgh walked in to vote and they had already voted according to the Democrat election machine?
[00:20:29.742 --> 00:20:30.283]  Did they forget?
[00:20:31.394 --> 00:20:36.960]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, this happened to Republican voters in our office when they would try to vote.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.121]  Oh, sorry, you can't.
[00:20:38.502 --> 00:20:40.784]  And a lot of times they didn't tell you it's because somebody voted in their name.
[00:20:41.265 --> 00:20:44.188]  That happened to people I personally know in Austin as well that had moved from California.
[00:20:44.648 --> 00:20:45.869]  They went looking for the Secretary of State.
[00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:47.011]  They voted for Hillary.
[00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:49.593]  They voted for Biden, even though they never voted for him.
[00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:50.675]  And they live in Texas.
[00:20:51.155 --> 00:20:53.436]  I mean, this is just massive.
[00:20:53.936 --> 00:20:57.097]  My brother-in-law was in Austin at the major post office on Congress.
[00:20:57.398 --> 00:21:05.461]  He came on the show about it and saw a guy with 50 ballots there at the election with his name with him accepting each one from him and taking a picture of himself to get paid.
[00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:07.522]  I mean, this was industrial fraud.
[00:21:08.242 --> 00:21:09.863]  I'm sure this press conference is going to go for hours.
[00:21:10.123 --> 00:21:11.523]  He's still on one state right now.
[00:21:11.543 --> 00:21:12.404]  Let's continue.
[00:21:13.744 --> 00:21:20.147]  The 50 to 60 witnesses we have for the way they were treated and not allowed to inspect
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:21.556]  The ballots.
[00:21:22.077 --> 00:21:24.298]  They weren't just not allowed to do it.
[00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:25.859]  They were pushed.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.481]  A few cases, they were assaulted.
[00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:31.143]  In all cases, they were put in a corral.
[00:21:33.045 --> 00:21:38.328]  So far away, probably the closest they got is from here to the back of that room.
[00:21:39.429 --> 00:21:42.691]  We could do like a... Did you all watch My Cousin Vinny?
[00:21:43.872 --> 00:21:44.393]  You know the movie?
[00:21:44.773 --> 00:21:47.775]  It's one of my favorite law movies because he comes from Brooklyn.
[00:21:48.622 --> 00:21:55.143]  And when the nice lady who said she saw, and then he says to her, how many fingers do I have?
[00:21:55.343 --> 00:21:56.423]  How many fingers do I got up?
[00:21:57.664 --> 00:21:59.744]  And she says, three.
[00:22:01.024 --> 00:22:03.845]  Well, she was too far away to see it was only two.
[00:22:04.605 --> 00:22:08.686]  These people were further away than my cousin Vinnie was from witness.
[00:22:09.346 --> 00:22:10.266]  They couldn't see a thing.
[00:22:11.086 --> 00:22:11.726]  Now, I don't know.
[00:22:12.606 --> 00:22:14.427]  You're going to tell me that 60 people are lying?
[00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:16.947]  They didn't just tell me this.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.901]  They swore under penalty of perjury, which is something no Democrats have ever done.
[00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:25.122]  You don't even ask Biden about this.
[00:22:27.242 --> 00:22:29.023]  You don't put him under penalty of perjury.
[00:22:29.043 --> 00:22:31.863]  He doesn't even get asked questions about it.
[00:22:32.644 --> 00:22:38.005]  He doesn't get asked questions about all the evidence of the crimes that he committed.
[00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:40.686]  These people are under penalty of perjury.
[00:22:40.986 --> 00:22:42.326]  Their names are on an affidavit.
[00:22:42.866 --> 00:22:46.267]  They swear that they weren't allowed
[00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:49.282]  To carry out their function as inspectors.
[00:22:49.822 --> 00:22:51.363]  And it's not just a technical thing.
[00:22:51.684 --> 00:22:52.924]  There's a reason they did it.
[00:22:54.065 --> 00:22:55.806]  And again, folks, it's not just that they swear it.
[00:22:55.846 --> 00:23:05.772]  We have video in Michigan, video in Wisconsin, video in Georgia, video in Pennsylvania of them boarding up the windows and assaulting people and throwing them out in violation of law.
[00:23:06.012 --> 00:23:06.492]  Continue.
[00:23:07.693 --> 00:23:11.375]  You were going to use those ballots to catch Biden up.
[00:23:12.636 --> 00:23:14.397]  And you had a big road ahead of you.
[00:23:14.986 --> 00:23:19.649]  You had to catch him up for 700,000 to 800,000 votes that he was behind.
[00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:24.232]  And the only way you were going to do it was with the mail-in ballots.
[00:23:25.273 --> 00:23:28.555]  You couldn't have a Democrat and Republican inspector around.
[00:23:28.995 --> 00:23:30.456]  They don't even have Democrats watching.
[00:23:31.337 --> 00:23:34.639]  Because they'd be afraid that they'd be honest Democrats who would say, you're cheating!
[00:23:38.421 --> 00:23:42.784]  So that takes us to Michigan, where there was an honest Democrat who said they were cheating.
[00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:48.963]  And we'll show you her affidavit.
[00:23:49.404 --> 00:23:53.505]  Because I know you keep reporting, falsely, that we have no evidence.
[00:23:54.345 --> 00:23:56.346]  That we have no specific acts of fraud.
[00:23:57.166 --> 00:24:01.028]  That's because the coverage of this has been almost as dishonest as the scheme itself.
[00:24:02.128 --> 00:24:03.969]  The American people are entitled to know this.
[00:24:04.989 --> 00:24:06.450]  You don't have a right to keep it from them.
[00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:08.711]  You don't have a right to lie about it.
[00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:10.031]  And you are.
[00:24:11.292 --> 00:24:14.493]  I mean, you don't report to them that a citizen of this country
[00:24:15.276 --> 00:24:21.380]  A very fine woman who is willing to allow me to give you her name.
[00:24:22.741 --> 00:24:27.325]  I can't give you all these affidavits because if I do, these people will be harassed.
[00:24:28.225 --> 00:24:28.886]  They'll be threatened.
[00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:31.007]  They may lose their job.
[00:24:32.668 --> 00:24:33.689]  They will lose their friends.
[00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.971]  We've lost lawyers in this case because they've been threatened.
[00:24:37.532 --> 00:24:39.233]  We've had lawyers that need protection.
[00:24:40.914 --> 00:24:42.996]  What's going on in this country is horrible.
[00:24:44.207 --> 00:24:46.769]  And the censorship that you're imposing is making it worse.
[00:24:47.849 --> 00:24:53.152]  But, Jessie Jacob is an adult citizen and a resident of the state of Michigan.
[00:24:54.193 --> 00:24:57.235]  She's been an employee of the city of Detroit for decades.
[00:24:58.515 --> 00:25:05.360]  I know her age, but she can tell you her age.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:12.804]  She was assigned to voting duties in September, and she was trained by the city of Detroit
[00:25:13.567 --> 00:25:14.127]  Same thing, Georgia.
[00:25:43.717 --> 00:25:44.097]  I don't know.
[00:25:45.298 --> 00:25:46.698]  Maybe you could say she's lying.
[00:25:47.438 --> 00:25:49.039]  But you can't say there's no evidence.
[00:25:49.379 --> 00:25:50.759]  This is what we call evidence.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.880]  This is direct evidence.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.521]  And that's circumstantial.
[00:25:55.561 --> 00:25:58.242]  I tried many, many cases, as did all my colleagues here.
[00:25:59.102 --> 00:26:02.764]  You put a witness on a witness stand, the witness is testifying to their own knowledge.
[00:26:03.084 --> 00:26:08.686]  This witness goes on the witness stand and she will say, I was told to adjust the date on the absentee ballots.
[00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:22.795]  I witnessed election workers and employees going over to the voting booths with voters in order to watch them vote and coach them for whom to vote.
[00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:24.837]  Completely illegal.
[00:26:26.158 --> 00:26:27.158]  She will testify to that.
[00:26:28.179 --> 00:26:28.519]  I don't know.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.361]  Biden's people can cross-examine her.
[00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:32.763]  But you can't just throw it away.
[00:26:33.803 --> 00:26:34.704]  Gee, there's no evidence.
[00:26:35.365 --> 00:26:36.846]  Next time you say that, you'll be lying.
[00:26:37.606 --> 00:26:38.907]  Caught this on video in Michigan.
[00:26:40.436 --> 00:26:49.839]  In Detroit, them teaching a class on how to not let people watch and how to take ballots that came in late and say that they came in on time.
[00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:51.180]  It's all on damn video.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.861]  And then the Democrats that run the state call up threatening the journalists that cover it with jail time.
[00:26:56.162 --> 00:26:57.222]  These are criminals, folks.
[00:26:57.262 --> 00:26:58.162]  We've caught them red-handed.
[00:26:58.382 --> 00:26:59.643]  I'm just backing up Giuliani here.
[00:26:59.863 --> 00:27:01.123]  We have the freaking video of this.
[00:27:01.163 --> 00:27:01.563]  Continue.
[00:27:02.144 --> 00:27:08.586]  When a person was trying to vote, don't ask for identification.
[00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:11.007]  Why would you not ask for identification?
[00:27:11.727 --> 00:27:16.749]  Because you knew that a lot of people not entitled to vote were going to come in and early vote.
[00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.492]  Because you knew that illegal immigrants were going to be allowed to vote.
[00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:32.096]  You knew, if you lived in Philadelphia, unless you're stu-nard, that's an Italian expression for stupid, unless you're stupid, you knew that a lot of people were coming over from Camden to vote.
[00:27:32.777 --> 00:27:33.517]  They do every year.
[00:27:34.797 --> 00:27:35.938]  Happens all the time in Philly.
[00:27:36.494 --> 00:27:40.536]  It's about as frequent as getting beaten up at a Philadelphia Eagles basketball, uh, football game.
[00:27:40.976 --> 00:27:41.897]  Happens all the time.
[00:27:42.437 --> 00:27:42.897]  All the time.
[00:27:44.098 --> 00:27:48.300]  And it's allowed to happen because it is a Democrat, corrupt city.
[00:27:49.561 --> 00:27:50.662]  And has been for years.
[00:27:53.123 --> 00:27:53.823]  Many, many years.
[00:27:54.283 --> 00:27:57.025]  And they carried it out in places they could get away with it.
[00:27:58.396 --> 00:28:00.218]  They didn't carry it out in neutral places.
[00:28:00.598 --> 00:28:02.460]  They didn't carry it out in Republican places.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.122]  They didn't carry it out where the law is respected.
[00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:13.209]  They carried it out in corrupt, in a corrupt city where the district attorney releases criminals en masse, which is why it has so much crime.
[00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:25.179]  She also said, I observed a large number of people who came to the satellite location to vote in person, but they had already applied for and submitted an absentee ballot.
[00:28:26.437 --> 00:28:28.839]  So she observed a lot of people voting twice.
[00:28:32.261 --> 00:28:37.584]  Again, this is Jesse Jacob, not me.
[00:28:40.366 --> 00:28:47.290]  I was instructed not to invalidate any ballots and not to look for any deficiency in the ballots.
[00:28:50.252 --> 00:28:50.852]  Why would you do that?
[00:28:50.872 --> 00:28:52.313]  Because you're cheating.
[00:28:53.453 --> 00:28:54.214]  On purpose, cheating.
[00:28:54.574 --> 00:28:55.915]  Intentionally cheating.
[00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.250]  You're cheating as a institution.
[00:28:59.751 --> 00:29:05.972]  This is an instruction from the Election Commissioner, or the employer, to the worker.
[00:29:07.893 --> 00:29:09.593]  Don't look for any deficiencies in the ballots.
[00:29:10.553 --> 00:29:15.314]  I was instructed not to look at any of the signatures on the absentee ballots.
[00:29:16.875 --> 00:29:24.436]  If she was instructed not to look for any of the signatures on the absentee ballots, why the heck do you sign it in the first place?
[00:29:25.777 --> 00:29:26.737]  In order to identify it.
[00:29:27.569 --> 00:29:31.733]  She was instructed not to do that because many of the absentee ballots were fraudulent.
[00:29:32.053 --> 00:29:32.634]  And they knew that.
[00:29:33.594 --> 00:29:34.695]  And they didn't want to have a count of that.
[00:29:37.218 --> 00:29:50.129]  On November 4, 2020, I was instructed to impromptly predate the absentee ballots when the receipt date was actually November... was after November 3, 2020.
[00:29:50.349 --> 00:29:54.593]  Now this is really significant because Justice Alito
[00:29:55.305 --> 00:30:11.868]  The Supreme Court instructed Pennsylvania that any ballot that comes in after 8 o'clock on November 3rd, 2020 had to be put aside and not opened because there's a question as to its legality and its constitutionality.
[00:30:12.868 --> 00:30:16.589]  What she's telling you is that they blatantly disregarded that order.
[00:30:17.829 --> 00:30:23.690]  That they took ballots that were marked the 4th and the 5th and the 6th and they marked it down for the 3rd.
[00:30:24.773 --> 00:30:27.614]  In blatant disregard of the order of the United States Supreme Court.
[00:30:28.755 --> 00:30:31.796]  I don't know if she's a Democrat or a Republican.
[00:30:32.976 --> 00:30:40.720]  I assume if she's working for the city of Detroit that she's a Democrat.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.560]  I assume, but I may be wrong.
[00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:43.581]  She's a citizen.
[00:30:45.382 --> 00:30:45.962]  I've never met her.
[00:30:46.562 --> 00:30:47.142]  Never coached her.
[00:30:49.924 --> 00:30:50.724]  And I'd like you to note
[00:30:53.368 --> 00:30:56.010]  That it's signed under penalties of perjury.
[00:30:59.013 --> 00:31:00.014]  We have a hundred more of these.
[00:31:01.415 --> 00:31:05.558]  I can't show them to you because those people don't want to be harassed.
[00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:11.963]  They don't want to have their lives torn apart by the goons on the other side.
[00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:13.525]  We don't do that to them.
[00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:16.948]  They've done that to a lot of our people.
[00:31:17.368 --> 00:31:18.449]  They've done it for four years.
[00:31:19.907 --> 00:31:22.028]  And it's outrageous that it's tolerated.
[00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:26.371]  And it's tolerated because you condone it in the press.
[00:31:26.772 --> 00:31:27.452]  And you don't cover it.
[00:31:27.812 --> 00:31:28.533]  And you don't condemn it.
[00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:31.335]  And it shouldn't happen to a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:31:31.715 --> 00:31:36.638]  A lawyer shouldn't have to withdraw from a case because he's representing the President of the United States.
[00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:42.062]  There are many more affidavits here.
[00:31:42.802 --> 00:31:44.624]  I'd like to read them all to you, but I don't have the time.
[00:31:45.284 --> 00:31:47.405]  You should have had the time and energy to go look for them!
[00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:49.587]  That's your job.
[00:31:50.925 --> 00:31:54.206]  Like it's my job to defend the President and to represent the President.
[00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:58.347]  It's your job to read these things and not falsely report that there's no evidence.
[00:31:58.847 --> 00:32:02.788]  Do you know how many affidavits we have in the Michigan case?
[00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:03.928]  220 affidavits.
[00:32:04.748 --> 00:32:06.288]  They're not all public, but eight of them are.
[00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:17.371]  Four affiants here, those are people who give affidavits, report an incident that under any other circumstances would have been on the front page of all your newspapers.
[00:32:18.132 --> 00:32:24.195]  If it didn't involve the hatred that you have, irrational, pathological hatred that you have, for the President.
[00:32:25.916 --> 00:32:34.540]  What they swear to, is that at 4.30 in the morning, a truck pulled up to the Detroit Center, where they were counting ballots.
[00:32:35.841 --> 00:32:38.322]  The people thought it was food, so they all ran to the truck.
[00:32:38.342 --> 00:32:39.883]  It wasn't food.
[00:32:41.444 --> 00:32:43.885]  It was thousands and thousands of ballots.
[00:32:44.605 --> 00:32:47.667]  And the ballots were in garbage cans, they were in
[00:32:48.658 --> 00:32:49.298]  Paper bags.
[00:32:50.018 --> 00:32:51.519]  They were in cardboard boxes.
[00:32:52.219 --> 00:32:53.399]  And they were taken into the center.
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.820]  They were put on a number of tables.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.121]  At that time, they thought all the Republican inspectors had left.
[00:33:01.261 --> 00:33:02.141]  All but two had.
[00:33:03.602 --> 00:33:06.363]  And an employee of Dominion, who
[00:33:09.173 --> 00:33:10.253]  We will address a little bit later.
[00:33:10.534 --> 00:33:10.914]  Dominion.
[00:33:11.514 --> 00:33:18.417]  Now, remember, folks, this is live coverage of the Giuliani Path to Victory Trump 2020 powerful press conference.
[00:33:18.437 --> 00:33:22.298]  We're commercial free, but some stations need to carry their ads because they're automated stations.
[00:33:22.318 --> 00:33:23.479]  So we're firing the brakes.
[00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:26.240]  And so some stations are not getting all this.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.101]  Last three minutes was incredibly powerful.
[00:33:28.961 --> 00:33:30.802]  Giuliani just annihilating them with proof.
[00:33:31.122 --> 00:33:33.303]  We're going to continue on live coverage as long as this goes.
[00:33:33.763 --> 00:33:35.384]  I'm in Georgia at Stop the Steal.
[00:33:35.424 --> 00:33:36.844]  Owen Schroeder is back in the ATX.
[00:33:37.184 --> 00:33:37.725]  Let's continue.
[00:33:39.975 --> 00:33:43.918]  And they're estimated to be a minimum of 60,000, maximum of 100,000.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.765]  Many of them were triple counted, which means they were put into the counting machine this way.
[00:33:52.505 --> 00:33:56.088]  Once, twice, three times.
[00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.850]  I didn't see that.
[00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:04.114]  I don't know that, but for the fact that three American citizens are willing to swear to it.
[00:34:06.496 --> 00:34:08.438]  And we're not going to let them go to court and do that?
[00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:21.493]  We're going to let this election go by when there are, in this case, 60 witnesses that can prove what I'm saying to you and other acts of fraud in Michigan?
[00:34:23.794 --> 00:34:26.636]  I mean, what's happened to this country if we're going to let that happen?
[00:34:27.096 --> 00:34:29.338]  What happened to this country if we're going to cover that up?
[00:34:30.058 --> 00:34:37.783]  We let Al Gore carry on an election dispute longer than this one has been going on for one state and for Chad's.
[00:34:39.398 --> 00:34:41.440]  This happened in Pennsylvania.
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.641]  It happened in Michigan.
[00:34:44.422 --> 00:35:00.873]  Michigan, probably, right now, if I count up the affidavits, just one case alone, Trump v. Benson, a case that we dismissed today because that case was attempting to get the Wayne County Board of Supervisors to decertify.
[00:35:01.233 --> 00:35:01.674]  Well, they did.
[00:35:02.414 --> 00:35:03.235]  They decertified.
[00:35:04.576 --> 00:35:06.157]  That case has a hundred affidavits.
[00:35:07.771 --> 00:35:13.804]  And the 100 affidavits show essentially what I've talked to you about.
[00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:18.811]  Counting ballots improperly, counting them three and four times.
[00:35:18.831 --> 00:35:23.093]  It's like an old lady with no criminal record that sees the neighbor kill his wife in the backyard.
[00:35:23.113 --> 00:35:26.075]  The guy goes to the gas chamber where he goes to lethal injection.
[00:35:26.695 --> 00:35:32.358]  Imagine per county, they have like hundreds of witnesses of like total, complete fraud.
[00:35:32.438 --> 00:35:35.060]  I mean, I've had family witnesses in Austin.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.301]  This is incredible.
[00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.582]  Trump won by a gigantic landslide.
[00:35:38.842 --> 00:35:39.262]  Continue.
[00:35:39.282 --> 00:35:42.904]  It's basically in Detroit that Biden won 80-20.
[00:35:44.545 --> 00:35:49.229]  So you see a change as a result of the election in Michigan, if you take out Wayne County.
[00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:51.791]  So it's a very significant case.
[00:35:52.772 --> 00:35:56.715]  That is being raised in the case of Costantino versus the city of Detroit.
[00:35:57.556 --> 00:35:59.557]  Not by us, but by an individual plaintiff.
[00:36:00.238 --> 00:36:02.800]  We are helping and assisting in that case, however.
[00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:07.704]  And you can find all the affidavits that you want filed in that case.
[00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:17.732]  You can find out they're not just allegations, they're allegations supported by sworn testimony, which is a lot better than Joe Biden has ever done on anything.
[00:36:18.152 --> 00:36:21.413]  He doesn't answer questions, much less give you sworn affidavits.
[00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:23.013]  Wisconsin.
[00:36:24.254 --> 00:36:28.955]  Wisconsin has a very small margin.
[00:36:28.975 --> 00:36:29.795]  21, 20,544 last time I looked.
[00:36:30.715 --> 00:36:35.016]  In Wisconsin, without going into great detail, very similar plan.
[00:36:36.457 --> 00:36:37.477]  Republicans shut out
[00:36:38.388 --> 00:36:49.270]  In the city of Milwaukee and also in Madison, Republicans almost uniformly shut out from the absentee process, not allowed to inspect, not allowed to look at the ballots.
[00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:56.652]  We have in Milwaukee and in the state of Wisconsin, a much stricter law.
[00:36:57.352 --> 00:37:00.253]  Wisconsin doesn't allow mail-in ballots.
[00:37:00.513 --> 00:37:03.214]  They didn't buy into the big mail-in ballot situation.
[00:37:04.214 --> 00:37:04.754]  Wisconsin
[00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:09.872]  When you look at their Constitution, it almost seems to not like absentee ballots.
[00:37:10.533 --> 00:37:12.474]  They state it's not a right, a privilege.
[00:37:13.234 --> 00:37:15.876]  And they have very, very strict procedures.
[00:37:16.997 --> 00:37:21.479]  And the strict procedure says that you can't be given an absentee ballot.
[00:37:21.879 --> 00:37:23.420]  You have to personally apply for it.
[00:37:23.781 --> 00:37:26.842]  It's illegal, basically, to solicit a vote.
[00:37:28.263 --> 00:37:32.025]  And they have actually many reasons for it that probably goes back to their
[00:37:33.863 --> 00:37:34.824]  Progressive days.
[00:37:35.284 --> 00:37:43.788]  When I say progressive, I mean late 19th century, early 20th century progressive, when that really meant progressive, not retrogressive.
[00:37:45.209 --> 00:37:54.694]  So there are 60,000 ballots in Milwaukee County and 40,000 ballots in Madison that
[00:37:56.289 --> 00:38:04.553]  As far as we can tell, and this is why we're auditing, because we have very good information, the numbers are going to come out about here, that don't have applications.
[00:38:06.014 --> 00:38:15.518]  Under the law of the state of Wisconsin, already decided, if there's no application for an absentee ballot, the absentee ballot is thrown away.
[00:38:17.519 --> 00:38:19.080]  This all happened in two places.
[00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:20.757]  In Wisconsin.
[00:38:21.198 --> 00:38:23.158]  Didn't happen in northern Wisconsin.
[00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:25.940]  Didn't happen in Republican Wisconsin.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.461]  Didn't happen in neutral Wisconsin, where there are an equal number of Republicans and Democrats.
[00:38:31.082 --> 00:38:36.624]  It happened in a place where the vote was 75-80% for the Democrat.
[00:38:38.145 --> 00:38:43.687]  You take away any number of those, and that 20,000 lead disappears.
[00:38:44.548 --> 00:38:47.949]  In other words, if you count the lawful votes, Trump won Wisconsin.
[00:38:48.553 --> 00:38:49.354]  By a good margin.
[00:38:49.774 --> 00:38:55.158]  Indeed, if you count the lawful votes in Pennsylvania, he won it by about 300,000 votes.
[00:38:59.021 --> 00:39:06.888]  Also, in the lawsuit filed in Wisconsin, which is really a petition because of their procedures,
[00:39:07.697 --> 00:39:10.961]  There were no inspectors provided for the count of the illegal ballots.
[00:39:11.943 --> 00:39:18.311]  Okay, you've got live, basically commercial-free coverage here of the Patch of Victory, Rudolph Giuliani press conference.
[00:39:18.331 --> 00:39:19.212]  This is gonna go for hours.
[00:39:19.873 --> 00:39:21.595]  I made a lot of preparation, I'm not complaining.
[00:39:22.375 --> 00:39:22.635]  All right.
[00:39:44.124 --> 00:39:50.707]  But I'm going to come back even earlier by myself with Owen and at least do 30 minutes on this because this is all unfolding now.
[00:39:50.727 --> 00:39:52.708]  This is just as serious as the election theft.
[00:39:53.088 --> 00:39:55.169]  It's all the same globalist takeover of America.
[00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:56.830]  Trump was blocking all of this.
[00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:58.791]  But we got some good news as well.
[00:39:58.831 --> 00:40:00.292]  But I got to just say this or we won't be here.
[00:40:01.451 --> 00:40:03.192]  I'm not funded by the New World Order.
[00:40:03.212 --> 00:40:05.974]  I'm not funded by any of these big globalist organizations.
[00:40:06.114 --> 00:40:09.757]  I'm funded by you, and I'm just asking you for your help.
[00:40:10.177 --> 00:40:12.218]  We have a big sale that I was going to end Wednesday.
[00:40:12.278 --> 00:40:15.301]  It's got to be extended through the weekend because I'm just, I don't have a new sale to do.
[00:40:15.681 --> 00:40:16.942]  So much stuff is about to be sold out.
[00:40:17.862 --> 00:40:20.724]  It is the Stop the Steal in the criminal lockdown 2.
[00:40:21.245 --> 00:40:24.287]  Super sale, up to 60% off, triple pay, three points, free shipping.

[00:41:50.548 --> 00:41:56.830]  Infowars.com, take action now and fund this operation, the Second American Revolution, so we can stay on air.
[00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.450]  Your support is critical.
[00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:05.332]  Back to Rudolph Giuliani, and then Owen Schroeder will be taking over in between here into the next hour.
[00:42:06.432 --> 00:42:09.593]  Arizona is a state that we're looking at very, very carefully.
[00:42:10.623 --> 00:42:13.204]  I would say we're probably going to bring a lawsuit in Arizona.
[00:42:13.624 --> 00:42:14.344]  More than probably.
[00:42:14.364 --> 00:42:16.484]  I think we are going to bring a lawsuit in Arizona.
[00:42:16.524 --> 00:42:17.845]  We're still collecting that evidence.
[00:42:18.845 --> 00:42:29.687]  And the state that we're looking at that would surprise you is we have very, very significant amount of fraud allegations in the state of New Mexico.
[00:42:32.068 --> 00:42:34.188]  And we have a significant number
[00:42:34.893 --> 00:42:36.314]  of allegations in the state of Virginia.
[00:42:36.614 --> 00:42:41.876]  I don't know yet whether the number in Virginia will reach the number that can turn the election.
[00:42:42.576 --> 00:42:58.301]  In the states that we have indicated in red, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona, we more than double the number of votes needed to overturn the election in terms of provable illegal ballots.
[00:42:59.182 --> 00:43:02.903]  All you got to do to find out if I'm misleading you at all
[00:43:03.712 --> 00:43:04.693]  Is to look at the lawsuits.
[00:43:06.254 --> 00:43:07.014]  Look what's alleged.
[00:43:07.094 --> 00:43:08.035]  Look at the affidavits.
[00:43:09.255 --> 00:43:10.916]  Maybe we can supply more affidavits.
[00:43:10.956 --> 00:43:12.957]  In order to do it, I have to get permission from the people.
[00:43:13.558 --> 00:43:20.442]  But in the materials I have here, there are at least 10 that come from citizens.
[00:43:20.502 --> 00:43:21.522]  We have a thousand at least.
[00:43:22.303 --> 00:43:23.624]  And we're getting more every day.
[00:43:24.604 --> 00:43:29.307]  And there are other aspects of this fraud that, at this point, I really can't reveal.
[00:43:30.781 --> 00:43:31.681]  This is really enough.
[00:43:32.221 --> 00:43:33.642]  It's enough to overturn any election.
[00:43:34.522 --> 00:43:35.822]  It's disgraceful what happened.
[00:43:36.402 --> 00:43:38.943]  And I'll conclude by asking you to just think about this for a minute.
[00:43:40.903 --> 00:43:48.925]  What happened on the morning of November 3rd when they were going to count this new kind of ballot, this mail-in ballot?
[00:43:50.685 --> 00:43:58.647]  Did every Democrat leader in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and in Wisconsin and in Georgia
[00:43:59.714 --> 00:44:05.898]  And in Nevada, and in Arizona, they all wake up and all separately have the same idea?
[00:44:07.038 --> 00:44:14.002]  Do they all separately have the idea that we are going to put Republican ballots systematically everywhere?
[00:44:15.223 --> 00:44:18.004]  We're not going to let them look at mail-in or absentee ballots?
[00:44:19.305 --> 00:44:20.646]  They all independently come up with that.
[00:44:21.807 --> 00:44:24.048]  Like, just by coincidence.
[00:44:24.908 --> 00:44:26.029]  They say, hey, you know, we're going to put
[00:44:27.273 --> 00:44:29.774]  We're going to put the Republicans in pens and corrals.
[00:44:30.354 --> 00:44:31.595]  We're going to do it in Pittsburgh.
[00:44:31.615 --> 00:44:32.775]  We're going to do it in Philadelphia.
[00:44:33.235 --> 00:44:34.536]  We're going to do it in Detroit.
[00:44:35.316 --> 00:44:36.537]  We're going to do it in Milwaukee.
[00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:38.337]  We're going to do it in Las Vegas.
[00:44:38.357 --> 00:44:40.718]  We're going to do it in Phoenix.
[00:44:42.439 --> 00:44:42.899]  What did I miss?
[00:44:42.959 --> 00:44:43.940]  Oh, we're going to do it in Atlanta.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:55.204]  Or, isn't the logical conclusion that I think any jury would accept, as they heard this evidence, that somebody had this plan?
[00:44:56.491 --> 00:45:04.275]  Maybe that was always the plan, to do this very, very questionable form of voting, which has been criticized.
[00:45:04.315 --> 00:45:06.016]  Yes, this is an organized, concerted fraud.
[00:45:06.056 --> 00:45:06.896]  It's the same everywhere.
[00:45:07.176 --> 00:45:09.657]  It's why Pelosi said Trump will not win.
[00:45:09.677 --> 00:45:11.078]  We don't care about what's happening next week.
[00:45:11.518 --> 00:45:12.439]  Biden won't be put in.
[00:45:12.839 --> 00:45:16.481]  It's why we have the inside and TV folks at Dominion saying it doesn't matter, he will win.
[00:45:16.821 --> 00:45:22.904]  It was organized like all the other organized fraud and the media not letting anybody question and blocking witnesses.
[00:45:23.504 --> 00:45:26.266]  Even including official poll watchers who came out.
[00:45:26.306 --> 00:45:27.587]  They were all censored by the internet.
[00:45:27.627 --> 00:45:28.708]  They were all censored by Big Tech.
[00:45:28.928 --> 00:45:34.993]  That's an organized criminal syndicate and mainstream media and Big Tech have been complicit in trying to overthrow our country.
[00:45:35.213 --> 00:45:37.094]  This is our country fighting for its damn life.
[00:45:37.315 --> 00:45:37.995]  This is war.
[00:45:38.275 --> 00:45:39.016]  Back to Giuliani.
[00:45:39.376 --> 00:45:41.278]  Even why he probably didn't have to go out and campaign.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.781]  He had to have known what they were going to do.
[00:45:46.241 --> 00:45:47.582]  This had to be planned in advance.
[00:45:48.303 --> 00:45:49.484]  I'm kind of checking
[00:45:50.427 --> 00:45:55.731]  Did they go, you know, to the same contractor to get the corrals to put the Republicans in?
[00:45:57.152 --> 00:45:59.313]  And this is a disgraceful thing that was done in this country.
[00:45:59.333 --> 00:46:00.654]  Probably not much more disgraceful.
[00:46:02.964 --> 00:46:05.206]  You hear with Giuliani how he's finishing my sentences?
[00:46:05.246 --> 00:46:05.926]  We didn't talk.
[00:46:05.986 --> 00:46:06.527]  It's the truth.
[00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:09.129]  This is organized fraud.
[00:46:09.609 --> 00:46:10.930]  Biden didn't even need to campaign.
[00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:12.711]  He even said in a speech, I don't need your votes.
[00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:13.252]  I'm going to win.
[00:46:13.432 --> 00:46:13.812]  Remember that?
[00:46:13.892 --> 00:46:14.573]  I don't need your votes.
[00:46:14.873 --> 00:46:16.094]  In fact, find that clip, Owen.
[00:46:16.134 --> 00:46:17.275]  Play that next hour a bunch.
[00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:18.516]  Back to Giuliani.
[00:46:18.536 --> 00:46:19.937]  We got to get this whole press conference up.
[00:46:19.957 --> 00:46:20.617]  This is powerful.
[00:46:20.818 --> 00:46:21.038]  Continue.
[00:46:21.058 --> 00:46:22.139]  We're going to become Venezuela.
[00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:24.500]  We cannot let this happen to us.
[00:46:25.541 --> 00:46:31.686]  We cannot not allow these crooks, because that's what they are, to steal an election from the American people.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.660]  They elected Donald Trump.
[00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:37.721]  They didn't elect Joe Biden.
[00:46:38.622 --> 00:46:51.145]  Joe Biden is in the lead because of the fraudulent ballots, the illegal ballots that were produced and that were allowed to be used after the election was over.
[00:46:51.725 --> 00:46:52.105]  That's right.
[00:46:53.445 --> 00:46:56.226]  Give us an opportunity to prove it in court and we will.
[00:46:57.506 --> 00:47:00.187]  Now I'm going to ask Sidney Powell
[00:47:01.701 --> 00:47:08.145]  To describe to you what we can describe about another totally outrageous situation.
[00:47:08.865 --> 00:47:14.489]  I don't think most Americans know that our ballots get calculated, many of them, outside the United States.
[00:47:15.209 --> 00:47:26.276]  And are completely open to hacking, completely open to change, and it's being done by a company that specializes in voter fraud.
[00:47:27.336 --> 00:47:28.537]  I'll let Sidney describe that to you.
[00:47:31.545 --> 00:47:32.166]  Thank you, Rudy.
[00:47:35.608 --> 00:47:53.422]  What we are really dealing with here and uncovering more by the day is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China in the interference with our elections here in the United States.
[00:47:54.463 --> 00:47:59.527]  The Dominion voting systems, the Smartmatic technology software,
[00:48:00.416 --> 00:48:19.491]  And the software that goes in other computerized voting systems here as well, not just Dominion, were created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chavez to make sure he never lost an election after one constitutional referendum came out the way he did not want it to come out.
[00:48:22.352 --> 00:48:23.733]  And again, folks, this is all true.
[00:48:23.753 --> 00:48:28.336]  This is a communist Chinese globalist takeover with criminals in our government.
[00:48:28.816 --> 00:48:30.157]  China Joe, this is the truth.
[00:48:30.457 --> 00:48:34.299]  It's a fact that it was tabulated in Venezuela and in Germany, and it's all coming out.
[00:48:34.359 --> 00:48:37.441]  We cannot give up because this is a foreign takeover.
[00:48:37.461 --> 00:48:38.002]  This is war.
[00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:40.683]  And they can't take us down with a frontal attack.
[00:48:40.723 --> 00:48:42.783]  They can only take us down from within, and this is it.
[00:48:43.083 --> 00:48:44.984]  And right now, we're getting taken down, folks.
[00:48:45.424 --> 00:48:56.586]  We're getting taken down, and they're saying the economy will never be turned on again, we'll be totally bankrupt forever, and have communism and own nothing, but the bankers will be offshore in jumbo jets with private islands.
[00:48:56.926 --> 00:48:58.967]  I mean, this is a James Bond movie for real.
[00:48:59.387 --> 00:49:00.887]  I'm going to hand this over to Owen Schroer.
[00:49:00.907 --> 00:49:03.988]  We'll do as much commercial free as we can into the next hour.
[00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:14.374]  Then I'll be back later to break down how we fight back at the heart of this and start calling for the arrest of the Davos globalists on top that are doing this, so the public knows who's behind this.
[00:49:14.534 --> 00:49:16.835]  Because our real power is we can predict what's coming next.
[00:49:17.235 --> 00:49:21.838]  We'll go back to the rest of the press conference with Owen Schroer, and I'll be back later here in the next few hours.
[00:49:22.098 --> 00:49:26.381]  Please stay with us and send the links out to band.video and infowars.com and newswars.com.
[00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:27.742]  That's the chain reaction.
[00:49:27.762 --> 00:49:28.923]  Say, America's fighting back.
[00:49:29.183 --> 00:49:30.244]  We've discovered the fraud.
[00:49:30.565 --> 00:49:31.525]  Find out what's censored.
[00:49:31.565 --> 00:49:33.027]  Find out what MSM doesn't want you to see.
[00:49:33.327 --> 00:49:34.908]  Find out how we saved the country and ourselves.
[00:49:35.209 --> 00:49:38.592]  And send that link out of your email, text message, word of mouth now.
[00:49:38.952 --> 00:49:39.793]  Send the live feed out.
[00:49:39.853 --> 00:49:40.694]  Back to the live feed.
[00:49:41.014 --> 00:49:48.160]  So overwhelming in so many of these states that it broke the algorithm that had been plugged into the system.
[00:49:48.541 --> 00:49:52.945]  And that's what caused them to have to shut down in the states they shut down in.
[00:49:53.525 --> 00:50:01.012]  That's when they came in the back door with all the mail-in ballots, many of which they had actually fabricated.
[00:50:01.472 --> 00:50:09.739]  Some were on pristine paper with identically matching perfect circle dots for Mr. Biden.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.362]  Others were shoved in in batches.
[00:50:13.422 --> 00:50:17.946]  They're always put in a certain number of batches and people would rerun the same batch.
[00:50:18.607 --> 00:50:35.349]  This corresponds to our statistical evidence that shows incredible spikes in the vote counts at particular times, and that corresponds to eyewitness testimony of numerous people who have come forward and said they saw the ballots come in the back door at that time.
[00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:41.437]  Notably, the Dominion executives are nowhere to be found now.
[00:50:41.698 --> 00:50:45.683]  They are moving their offices overnight to different places.
[00:50:45.743 --> 00:50:49.248]  Their office in Toronto was shared with one of the Soros entities.
[00:50:50.027 --> 00:51:03.669]  One of the leaders of the Dominion Project overall is Lord Malick Brown, Mr. Soros' number two person in the UK and part of his organization.
[00:51:04.029 --> 00:51:12.031]  There are ties of the Dominion leadership to the Clinton Foundation and to other known politicians in this country.
[00:51:12.851 --> 00:51:17.672]  Just to give you a brief description of how this worked, I'm going to quote from
[00:51:20.389 --> 00:51:25.253]  A letter that was written and I will read that to make sure I get the quotes right.
[00:51:25.974 --> 00:51:33.620]  This person was objecting to the United States acquisition of Sequoia Voting Systems by Smartmatic, a foreign owned company.
[00:51:34.301 --> 00:51:42.868]  I believe this transaction raises exactly the sort of foreign ownership issues that CFIUS is best positioned to examine for national security purposes.
[00:51:43.766 --> 00:51:47.708]  It's undisputed that Smartmatic is foreign-owned and it has acquired Sequoia.
[00:51:47.728 --> 00:51:49.928]  They keep changing the names as they go along.
[00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:54.950]  Different times when a problem comes up, they just create another corporation and call it a different name.
[00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:59.752]  But it was a voting machine company doing business in the United States.
[00:52:00.193 --> 00:52:05.695]  Sequoia voting machines were used to record over 125 million votes during the 2004 presidential election in the United States.
[00:52:10.575 --> 00:52:21.051]  Smartmatic now acknowledges that Antonio Mujica, a Venezuelan businessman, has controlling interest in Smartmatic, but the company has not revealed who all the Smartmatic owners are.
[00:52:21.721 --> 00:52:26.403]  According to the press, Smartmatic's owners are hidden through a web of offshore private entities.
[00:52:26.964 --> 00:52:28.845]  And that is, in fact, true.
[00:52:29.505 --> 00:52:36.408]  Smartmatic has been associated with the Venezuelan government led by Hugo Chavez, which is openly hostile to the United States.
[00:52:36.828 --> 00:52:42.931]  And of course, as we all know, communistic and really brutalizing its own people.
[00:52:43.412 --> 00:52:48.034]  The system has been continued there by Mr. Maduro and ensured his election.
[00:52:49.111 --> 00:53:03.744]  Smartmatic's possible connection to the Venezuelan government poses a potential national security concern in the context of its acquisition of Sequoia because electronic voting machines are susceptible to tampering and insiders are in the best position to engage in such tampering.
[00:53:04.644 --> 00:53:07.707]  This letter expresses concern of the Chicago 2006 primary election.
[00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:25.579]  And it ends by saying the products and services that are of Venezuelan origin and evaluate Smartmatic's ownership to determine who could have influence and control over these and other Sequoia products and services are important to the national security of the United States.
[00:53:26.159 --> 00:53:34.444]  This letter was written to Hank Paulson on October 6, 2006 by Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney.
[00:53:37.426 --> 00:53:37.926]  Senators
[00:53:39.067 --> 00:53:44.211]  Klobuchar and Warren have raised these concerns as recently as December 2019.
[00:53:45.412 --> 00:53:56.220]  Why our government has not taken them seriously is beyond my comprehension unless they have some of the three-letter agencies have used them themselves in other parts of the world.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:01.243]  We know that the technology was exported to affect an election in Argentina.
[00:54:01.704 --> 00:54:07.388]  That's admitted by our friend who wrote the affidavit about Hugo Chavez and his interest in Smartmatic.
[00:54:09.935 --> 00:54:17.401]  Again, in 2006, Carolyn Maloney wrote the Honorable John Snow, the Secretary of the Treasury, about the issues.
[00:54:20.383 --> 00:54:33.813]  Speaking of Smartmatic's leadership, one of the Smartmatic patent holders, Eric Coomer, I believe his name is, is on the web as being recorded in a conversation with Antifa.
[00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:40.081]  Members saying that he had the election rigged for Mr. Biden.
[00:54:40.521 --> 00:54:41.782]  Nothing to worry about here.
[00:54:41.942 --> 00:54:45.485]  And he was going to, they were going to F Trump.
[00:54:46.305 --> 00:54:56.853]  His social media is filled with hatred for the president and for the United States of America as a whole, as are the social media accounts of many other smartmatic people.
[00:54:58.735 --> 00:55:00.757]  There has been widespread use of this.
[00:55:01.198 --> 00:55:05.682]  Dominion itself is utilized in 2,000 jurisdictions in 30 states.
[00:55:06.363 --> 00:55:12.029]  It has been uncertifiable in multiple states who realized all the problems that it had, including Texas.
[00:55:12.854 --> 00:55:24.285]  Experts have described it across the board from a Princeton group of three professors to experts that we have talked to about its end-user vulnerabilities.
[00:55:24.965 --> 00:55:28.369]  People can admittedly go in and change whatever they want.
[00:55:28.469 --> 00:55:31.672]  They can set the ratio of votes from one thing to another.
[00:55:31.732 --> 00:55:37.337]  They can say that a Biden vote counts as 1.25 and a Trump vote counts as 0.75.
[00:55:39.019 --> 00:55:41.640]  And those may be the numbers that were actually used here.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.961]  It's not just the swing states that were affected.
[00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:50.103]  The algorithm was likely run across the country to affect the entire election.
[00:55:50.483 --> 00:56:02.648]  Like I said, we only discovered it this year because of the overwhelming number of votes for President Trump in the swing states that caused the machines to have to shut down for them to backfill
[00:56:03.568 --> 00:56:04.949]  Uh, for adding votes.
[00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:18.013]  We have evidence of different numbers of votes being injected into the system, the same identical, unique six digit number multiple times in at least two states that we've analyzed so far.
[00:56:18.053 --> 00:56:20.314]  And I'm talking about like 341,542 votes for Biden and 100,012 for Trump.
[00:56:26.961 --> 00:56:33.746]  There's no explanation, no logical explanation for the same numbers being injected 20 minutes apart into the machine.
[00:56:35.387 --> 00:56:46.837]  The software manual itself, you can download it from the internet and I would encourage you all to read it because it specifically advertises some of these things as features of the system.
[00:56:47.817 --> 00:56:55.884]  Why it was ever allowed into this country is beyond my comprehension and why nobody has dealt with it is absolutely appalling.
[00:56:56.576 --> 00:56:58.898]  The machines were easily accessible to hackers.
[00:56:58.958 --> 00:57:05.983]  There's video on the net that it will explain to you how a kid with a cell phone can hack one of these voting machines.
[00:57:07.304 --> 00:57:09.946]  There's been no oversight of Dominion or its software.
[00:57:09.966 --> 00:57:14.229]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to continue this uninterrupted coverage of this historic press conference.
[00:57:14.269 --> 00:57:16.691]  We have to take this top-of-the-hour break, though.
[00:57:16.751 --> 00:57:20.414]  It's two minutes, and we'll be right back live with Sidney Powell.
[00:57:22.287 --> 00:57:23.649]  Sidney Powell is live.
[00:57:23.689 --> 00:57:28.916]  Rudy Giuliani eviscerated the Democrat voter fraud for an hour.
[00:57:29.076 --> 00:57:30.358]  I had to stand in applause.
[00:57:30.398 --> 00:57:33.762]  Sidney Powell is up to bat now and she's doing the same thing.
[00:57:34.303 --> 00:57:36.786]  Let's go back live to this historic press conference.
[00:57:37.247 --> 00:57:40.269]  This is stunning, heartbreaking, infuriating, and the most unpatriotic
[00:58:05.994 --> 00:58:13.520]  Acts I can even imagine for people in this country to have participated in in any way shape or form.
[00:58:14.312 --> 00:58:18.894]  And I want the American public to know right now that we will not be intimidated.
[00:58:19.474 --> 00:58:27.078]  American patriots are fed up with the corruption from the local level to the highest level of our government.
[00:58:27.218 --> 00:58:29.399]  And we are going to take this country back.
[00:58:29.859 --> 00:58:31.660]  We are not going to be intimidated.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.341]  We are not going to back down.
[00:58:33.801 --> 00:58:36.702]  We are going to clean this mess up now.
[00:58:37.182 --> 00:58:39.443]  President Trump won by a landslide.
[00:58:39.543 --> 00:58:40.664]  We are going to prove it.
[00:58:41.304 --> 00:58:46.467]  And we are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote for freedom.
[00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:53.972]  How come you're not suing in the Wisconsin counties that use this?
[00:58:54.092 --> 00:58:56.453]  Why are you only doing a recount?
[00:58:56.574 --> 00:58:58.935]  Excuse me, we're not out to the questions at this point.
[00:58:59.956 --> 00:59:02.117]  So excuse me, we're not at the questions at this point.
[00:59:02.557 --> 00:59:06.380]  My name is Jonah Ellis and I'm the senior legal advisor to the Trump campaign.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.381]  Alright, so a Democrat hack obviously in the audience trying to scuttle this.
[00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:10.102]  It's not going to work.
[00:59:10.902 --> 00:59:13.784]  Where we're at and what you can expect from this process.
[00:59:14.204 --> 00:59:19.708]  So what you have heard, I'm sure, in the fake newspapers tomorrow will be one of two things.
[00:59:19.988 --> 00:59:24.971]  Either there was not sufficient evidence that we've presented or we spoke too long.
[00:59:25.732 --> 00:59:29.693]  Okay, so what you've heard now is basically an opening statement.
[00:59:30.254 --> 00:59:41.978]  This is what you can expect to see when we get to court to actually have a full trial on the merits, to actually show this evidence in court and prove our case.
[00:59:42.158 --> 00:59:46.579]  This is not a Law & Order episode where everything is neatly wrapped up in 60 minutes.
[00:59:47.019 --> 00:59:54.882]  For those of you who are here in this room or have maybe tuned out in other networks, clearly you've never been court reporters.
[00:59:56.002 --> 00:59:57.122]  Trials take time.
[00:59:57.383 --> 00:59:58.843]  Putting on evidence takes time.
[00:59:59.023 --> 01:00:15.629]  This is basically an opening statement so the American people can understand what the networks have been hiding and what they refuse to cover because all of your fake news headlines are dancing around the merits of this case and are trying to delegitimize what we are doing here.
[01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:22.251]  Let me be very clear that our objective is to make sure to preserve and protect election integrity.
[01:00:22.571 --> 01:00:25.232]  President Trump has been saying from day one
[01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:29.675]  That this is about maintaining free and fair elections in this country.
[01:00:30.135 --> 01:00:32.317]  It is not about overturning an outcome.
[01:00:32.477 --> 01:00:36.199]  It is about making sure that election integrity is preserved.
[01:00:36.239 --> 01:00:38.341]  And every American should want that.
[01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:43.104]  If every American is not on board with that, you have to ask yourself why.
[01:00:43.664 --> 01:00:50.829]  And if your fake news network is not covering this or allowing you to cover it fairly and accurately, you should ask yourself why.
[01:00:51.449 --> 01:00:54.190]  This is absolutely a legitimate legal basis.
[01:00:54.590 --> 01:01:02.531]  We have been asked to provide an entire case that generally would take years in civil litigation.
[01:01:02.931 --> 01:01:03.932]  I've been a prosecutor.
[01:01:03.992 --> 01:01:07.152]  I have tried cases with far simpler facts.
[01:01:07.792 --> 01:01:11.153]  One thing happened in a matter of minutes and it still takes days.
[01:01:12.153 --> 01:01:14.134]  And we go through a jury process.
[01:01:14.854 --> 01:01:17.054]  This is the court of public opinion right now.
[01:01:17.515 --> 01:01:19.655]  We are not trying our case in the court of public opinion.
[01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:22.631]  Because if we were, we would get unbiased jurors.
[01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:30.635]  I would strike 99% of you from the jury, and I would be allowed to, because of the fake news coverage you provide.
[01:01:30.735 --> 01:01:32.836]  You are not unbiased jurors.
[01:01:33.457 --> 01:01:48.184]  And until you step out of your role as a journalist and actually go into a courtroom, and you are a judge on a bench that has sworn an oath to be unbiased in our separation of powers, then your opinion does not matter.
[01:01:48.764 --> 01:01:49.665]  The facts matter.
[01:01:49.785 --> 01:01:50.605]  The truth matters.
[01:01:50.685 --> 01:01:57.908]  And if you are fair reporters, you will cover that fairly and appropriately and you will allow coverage of our media.
[01:01:57.928 --> 01:02:01.690]  This is Jenna Ellis, one of Trump's great legal team members.
[01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:03.891]  I mean, what an absolute champion.
[01:02:04.151 --> 01:02:05.271]  This is incredible, folks.
[01:02:05.692 --> 01:02:06.652]  We're skipping these breaks.
[01:02:06.692 --> 01:02:07.492]  This is historic.
[01:02:08.153 --> 01:02:08.473]  Wow.
[01:02:08.713 --> 01:02:09.633]  What a moment here.
[01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:12.054]  American patriots are rising and fighting back.
[01:02:12.114 --> 01:02:13.055]  This is only the beginning.
[01:02:13.075 --> 01:02:13.975]  We've only begun to fight.
[01:02:13.995 --> 01:02:15.616]  Let's go back to this historic press conference.
[01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:23.729]  This is an opening statement.
[01:02:24.689 --> 01:02:29.933]  This is something where we have told you what the evidence will show and we have given you a brief description.
[01:02:47.302 --> 01:02:55.750]  And this is an elite strike force team that is working on behalf of the president and the campaign to make sure that our Constitution is protected.
[01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:59.993]  We are a nation of rules, not a nation of rulers.
[01:03:00.974 --> 01:03:06.159]  There is not someone that just gets to pick who the next president is outside the will of the American people.
[01:03:06.859 --> 01:03:13.145]  And that is our task, because when we talk about voter fraud, it's actually election official fraud.
[01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:15.304]  That cannot stand.
[01:03:15.344 --> 01:03:21.146]  The Constitution requires that the state legislatures are the ones that make election laws.
[01:03:21.166 --> 01:03:27.427]  Once again, this is InfoWars live coverage of the historic Stop the Steal press conference is what we'll call it.
[01:03:27.507 --> 01:03:30.748]  Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis speaking now.
[01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:33.068]  Joseph DeGeneva looks like is in the background.
[01:03:33.108 --> 01:03:33.929]  Maybe he'll speak too.
[01:03:34.369 --> 01:03:37.049]  And Jenna Ellis is just laying it all out right now.
[01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.970]  No holds barred.
[01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:39.430]  Let's go back to this live coverage.
[01:03:41.575 --> 01:03:54.126]  Our founders were so brilliant that they anticipated this, that there would be corruption, there would be foreign influence, there would be attempts to manipulate the outcome of the election, especially with who they called our chief magistrate.
[01:03:54.406 --> 01:04:06.677]  I would encourage all of you to go home and actually read Alexander Hamilton's Federalist 68 and see what he described as an advocacy position to adopt and ratify
[01:04:07.623 --> 01:04:08.083]  We're good to go.
[01:04:36.557 --> 01:04:38.217]  That is what we are advocating for.
[01:04:38.817 --> 01:04:41.538]  We want to make sure to protect election integrity.
[01:04:42.118 --> 01:04:54.820]  And your president, President Trump, we are so proud that he is in this fight because he understands that when he swore his oath of office, he swore an oath to uphold and defend the United States Constitution.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.340]  That is what he is doing.
[01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:58.681]  And that is what we are doing.
[01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:05.582]  We are confident that through this multiple pathway to victory, we will get to the actual outcome that the evidence shows.
[01:05:07.091 --> 01:05:10.072]  But this is not about overturning an election on our part.
[01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:16.913]  It's about making sure that we protect and preserve free and fair elections for all future American elections.
[01:05:17.233 --> 01:05:29.795]  If the United States caves to corruption or this type of election integrity disaster, then no election will be secure from here on out.
[01:05:30.655 --> 01:05:33.776]  And we all need to be keenly aware of that.
[01:05:34.574 --> 01:05:44.399]  We are the representatives here that are standing in this gap and defending President Trump and defending you, the American people, at the end of the day.
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.781]  This is ultimately about the United States of America.
[01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:50.482]  And we want to make sure to protect and defend that.
[01:05:50.522 --> 01:05:53.144]  And as my colleagues have said, we will not back down.
[01:05:53.224 --> 01:05:54.224]  We won't be intimidated.
[01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:56.005]  President Trump will not be intimidated.
[01:05:56.305 --> 01:05:58.346]  You, the American people, should not be intimidated.
[01:05:58.427 --> 01:06:01.088]  You, the press, should cover this fairly.
[01:06:02.074 --> 01:06:07.176]  And should know that this matters to election integrity and it matters to the future of our nation.
[01:06:08.116 --> 01:06:11.837]  So we have given you an overview, but recognize this is not a court of law.
[01:06:12.117 --> 01:06:24.441]  We will get there and we have time and we have constitutional provisions that will step in when we show the corruption and the irredeemably challenged and overturned votes.
[01:06:25.367 --> 01:06:25.867]  That was incredible.
[01:06:50.287 --> 01:06:51.367]  Let's go back to Sidney Powell.
[01:07:12.413 --> 01:07:21.746]  And of course we know China also has a substantial presence in Venezuela and substantial interest in making sure that President Trump does not continue in office.
[01:07:22.147 --> 01:07:23.409]  This is the consummate
[01:07:24.477 --> 01:07:30.681]  Foreign interference in our election in the most criminal way you can possibly imagine.
[01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.562]  It must be shut down.
[01:07:32.962 --> 01:07:50.332]  We know, for example, that one of the Dominion's highest level employees or officers went to Detroit himself to man the Detroit Operations Center where he could watch the votes coming in real time and decide what file folder in the system to put those votes into.
[01:07:51.505 --> 01:07:58.361]  That's why you see massive spikes after hours when people were told that all the votes were in and all the votes were counted.
[01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:02.672]  Many Dominion employees have already reached out to us to tell us the truth.
[01:08:03.052 --> 01:08:06.633]  They are Americans who want to ensure election integrity like we do.
[01:08:07.114 --> 01:08:23.719]  I would encourage every Dominion or Smartmatic employee who is fed up with the corruption in this country to come forward as soon as possible because these are serious federal offenses that I am confident the Department of Justice will be in pursuit of in very short order if they are not already.
[01:08:28.781 --> 01:08:30.102]  All right, a few questions.
[01:08:30.122 --> 01:08:40.567]  Mayor Giuliani, this sort of reminds me of 30 years ago, they had federal judges doing consent decrees over elections, so you had a federal judge overseeing the election.
[01:08:40.767 --> 01:08:47.390]  Will you be asking that in Georgia, where you have two Senate races, the U.S.
[01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:51.172]  District Court judges and federal authorities monitoring elections?
[01:08:52.953 --> 01:08:54.413]  I can't say what's going to be done about it.
[01:08:57.138 --> 01:08:59.319]  I'm sorry, in what county?
[01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:05.541]  Yep, I know about it.
[01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:07.182]  I really can't give you an opinion on that.
[01:09:08.142 --> 01:09:15.664]  I think obviously every election official should learn something from this and be very very careful with the next election.
[01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:23.287]  I know this is a lot of information that we've given you, probably because we're frustrated with
[01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:37.860]  What we keep reading and hearing in the censored press, which is that we have no evidence, we have no specifics, we have no backup for what we're saying, and you largely ignore the affidavits that are filed.
[01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:42.903]  Whether you agree or disagree with an affidavit, it's evidence.
[01:09:44.705 --> 01:09:49.368]  You can't say, I mean, you're just lying to the American people when you say there's no evidence.
[01:09:50.927 --> 01:09:57.351]  Sidney was giving you information that come from affidavits from other people that are given under oath.
[01:09:58.451 --> 01:10:19.723]  I was explaining things to you from affidavits that come from other people, American citizens, who swear under oath that they saw 100,000 ballots come in and that they were all for Joe Biden and that, I should point out now that Sidney has spoken, that those happened
[01:10:20.586 --> 01:10:34.712]  Just around the time that the Dominion or Smartmatic people called a halt to the election and then you can also trace it with a very big spike in the vote count at exactly that time.
[01:10:36.172 --> 01:10:36.452]  Right up.
[01:10:37.873 --> 01:10:48.517]  So what we're telling you is supported by evidence and we're going to have to present these because of the procedures that exist
[01:10:49.435 --> 01:10:51.957]  According to the different voting laws of the different states.
[01:10:51.997 --> 01:10:55.299]  For example, you asked us about Wisconsin.
[01:10:55.879 --> 01:11:04.865]  We have to first create a contest in Wisconsin before we can move to bringing a fulsome federal lawsuit.
[01:11:05.726 --> 01:11:10.009]  The contest, from everything I can see, is going to overturn the vote.
[01:11:10.749 --> 01:11:16.273]  Because it's going to show somewhere around 100,000 illegal ballots in two counties
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:21.001]  That Biden carried by 75, 80 percent.
[01:11:21.062 --> 01:11:22.502]  And you know how close Wisconsin is.
[01:11:23.122 --> 01:11:28.264]  And what I'm talking about is the absentee ballots for which there were no applications.
[01:11:29.264 --> 01:11:30.685]  And that's not just a small matter.
[01:11:31.285 --> 01:11:41.609]  The reason for the application and the reason that keep all these things together is precisely to avoid what the Democrats did in this election.
[01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:48.315]  Which is to misuse the absentee ballot process and the mail-in ballot process in order to cheat.
[01:11:49.336 --> 01:11:51.057]  So they really cheated in two respects.
[01:11:52.118 --> 01:11:53.259]  They cheated with the machines.
[01:11:56.522 --> 01:12:11.594]  Instead of asking me, are we going to bring a lawsuit in Wisconsin, which we will if we have to, you should have asked me, and you should be more astounded by the fact that our votes are counted in Germany
[01:12:12.515 --> 01:12:18.621]  And in Spain, by a company owned by affiliates of Chavez and Maduro.
[01:12:19.782 --> 01:12:21.103]  Did you ever believe that was true?
[01:12:21.583 --> 01:12:24.286]  Did any of you here believe that that was possible?
[01:12:25.327 --> 01:12:25.907]  Of course it's not.
[01:12:26.228 --> 01:12:27.529]  Of course it shouldn't be possible.
[01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:36.217]  I don't know if we're going to have time to develop all that in time to fill the requirements of all these cases.
[01:12:36.717 --> 01:12:38.759]  We have enough evidence without that to overturn.
[01:12:39.474 --> 01:12:40.014]  This election.
[01:12:40.075 --> 01:12:42.316]  We have it from the affidavits of American citizens.
[01:12:43.177 --> 01:12:45.699]  But that's a matter of national security that we're talking about now.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.841]  Very, very serious matter of national security.
[01:12:49.382 --> 01:12:50.383]  Please don't make light of it.
[01:12:51.443 --> 01:12:52.925]  And don't act like you knew it.
[01:12:53.705 --> 01:12:54.546]  Don't act like it is a surprise.
[01:12:54.606 --> 01:13:07.136]  I wasn't a surprise right now to cover this historic press conference, but in case anybody in that room is listening, please, for the love of God, give Rudy Giuliani a towel to wipe his shoe polish sweat sideburns off the side of his face.
[01:13:07.156 --> 01:13:08.257]  I'm begging you guys.
[01:13:09.141 --> 01:13:09.481]  Please.
[01:13:10.561 --> 01:13:11.942]  Let's go back to Rudy Giuliani.
[01:13:12.202 --> 01:13:33.349]  The company counting our vote, with control over our vote, is owned by two Venezuelans who were allies of Chavez, are present allies of Maduro, with a company whose chairman is a close associate and business partner of George Soros.
[01:13:34.306 --> 01:13:40.568]  The biggest donor to the Democrat Party, the biggest donor to Antifa, and the biggest donor to Black Lives Matter.
[01:13:41.228 --> 01:13:47.729]  My goodness, what do we have to do to get you to give our people the truth?
[01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.210]  Yes?
[01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:52.691]  Thank you, Giuliani, as well as the RSPN.
[01:13:53.151 --> 01:13:53.851]  Do you feel that heat?
[01:13:56.901 --> 01:14:00.863]  The last part was, do they work with defense groups and the CIA?
[01:14:00.883 --> 01:14:04.964]  First, I'm in charge of this investigation with Sidney and the people you see here.
[01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:31.669]  There's been no pressure to stop investigating Dominion.
[01:14:31.929 --> 01:14:34.430]  No, I'm not pressuring you all to stop.
[01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:36.590]  No, there's pressure to go as fast as we can.
[01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:40.851]  I mean, I think there was uniform shock when we first heard it.
[01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:44.552]  I think when I first heard it, I didn't believe it until Sidney showed me the documents.
[01:14:45.112 --> 01:14:55.614]  And in fact, I feel kind of stupid, and you all should, because all you had to do is go online and find out that Smartmatic is owned by Venezuelans close to Chavez.
[01:14:56.502 --> 01:14:57.143]  You can Google it!
[01:14:57.824 --> 01:14:59.066]  Well, unless they take it down.
[01:14:59.387 --> 01:15:00.008]  I preserved it.
[01:15:00.588 --> 01:15:01.330]  So you can find it.
[01:15:02.011 --> 01:15:04.635]  Not, you know, and by the way, the Coomer character...
[01:15:05.424 --> 01:15:12.308]  You know, we're covering this live, we're skipping breaks, this is so historic, and I'm getting a lot of people reaching out to me.
[01:15:12.529 --> 01:15:15.230]  In fact, you know what, let me just say that when we come back live, because this is important.
[01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:23.896]  So let's go back to this live, we're skipping a break right now, but when we come back and satellite feeds pick us back up on the terrestrial radio and other things, I'm gonna make a statement here.
[01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:26.297]  But let's go back and I'm gonna make a statement in two seconds here.
[01:15:26.678 --> 01:15:27.838]  That they're gonna fix this election!
[01:15:29.079 --> 01:15:31.021]  I don't know what you need to wake you up!
[01:15:32.221 --> 01:15:33.102]  To do your job!
[01:15:34.392 --> 01:15:39.955]  And inform the American people, whether you like it or not, of the things they need to know.
[01:15:40.556 --> 01:15:41.376]  This is real.
[01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:43.618]  It is not made up.
[01:15:43.818 --> 01:15:46.759]  There's nobody here that engages in fantasies.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.560]  I've tried a hundred cases.
[01:15:49.161 --> 01:15:51.982]  I prosecuted some of the most dangerous criminals in the world.
[01:15:53.143 --> 01:15:53.964]  I know crimes.
[01:15:54.044 --> 01:15:54.764]  I can smell them.
[01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:56.105]  You don't have to smell this one.
[01:15:56.305 --> 01:15:58.066]  I can prove it to you 18 different ways.
[01:15:59.027 --> 01:16:01.028]  I can prove to you that he won
[01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:03.642]  Pennsylvania by 300,000 votes.
[01:16:04.303 --> 01:16:08.125]  I can prove to you that he won Michigan by probably 50,000 votes.
[01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:16.029]  When I went to bed on election night, he was ahead in all those states, every single one of those states.
[01:16:16.449 --> 01:16:17.950]  How is it they all turned around?
[01:16:19.011 --> 01:16:20.312]  Every single one of them turned around?
[01:16:21.272 --> 01:16:23.634]  Or is it more consistent that there was a plan to turn them around?
[01:16:24.854 --> 01:16:29.257]  And since there are witnesses who say there was a plan to turn them around, and it's kind of
[01:16:30.242 --> 01:16:34.465]  Begs credulity to say that it all happened in every single state.
[01:16:35.666 --> 01:16:37.708]  My goodness, this is how you win cases in a courtroom.
[01:16:37.728 --> 01:16:39.569]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:39.589 --> 01:16:40.050]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.490]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.970]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.431]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:41.451 --> 01:16:42.031]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:42.051 --> 01:16:42.472]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:42.492 --> 01:16:43.833]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:43.873 --> 01:16:44.493]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:44.513 --> 01:16:45.134]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:45.194 --> 01:16:45.614]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:46.535]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:46.555 --> 01:16:47.075]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:47.095 --> 01:16:47.796]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:47.816 --> 01:16:48.396]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:48.416 --> 01:16:49.978]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:49.998 --> 01:16:51.098]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:51.118 --> 01:16:51.659]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:51.679 --> 01:16:52.399]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:52.419 --> 01:16:53.460]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:53.981]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:54.001 --> 01:16:54.461]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:54.481 --> 01:16:55.442]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:55.482 --> 01:16:56.202]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:56.222 --> 01:16:57.443]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:57.463 --> 01:16:58.144]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:58.244 --> 01:16:58.824]  Sir, is that your goal?
[01:16:58.844 --> 01:16:59.465]  Sir, is that your goal
[01:17:01.007 --> 01:17:02.087]  What publication are you with?
[01:17:03.548 --> 01:17:06.028]  CNN.
[01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:13.730]  It's to go around the outrageous iron curtain of censorship and get facts to the American people.
[01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.830]  This is beautiful.
[01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:17.591]  We just had a public laughing stock at CNN here.
[01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:19.291]  You've been reporting for the last two weeks.
[01:17:20.512 --> 01:17:21.632]  These are facts.
[01:17:22.699 --> 01:17:24.501]  These are things that actually happened.
[01:17:24.521 --> 01:17:26.463]  These people really wrote these affidavits.
[01:17:26.823 --> 01:17:33.951]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back from what is a skipped break as we're covering this historic landmark press conference here.
[01:17:33.991 --> 01:17:39.456]  But, you know, I'm having a lot of people sending me messages, giving me feedback so far from today.
[01:17:39.496 --> 01:17:42.119]  I hosted the Alex Jones Show yesterday with Alex.
[01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:43.020]  I hosted the War Room.
[01:17:44.401 --> 01:17:45.702]  I guess you could say I was kind of on edge.
[01:17:47.132 --> 01:17:48.133]  We'll just leave it at that.
[01:17:48.753 --> 01:17:55.196]  And people are sending me messages today saying, Owen, you sound a lot better today, you sound more confident, you sound a little more cool and collected and calm.
[01:17:55.456 --> 01:17:56.036]  What's going on?
[01:17:56.597 --> 01:17:59.758]  Folks, you have no idea what a big relief this is for me.
[01:18:00.298 --> 01:18:00.558]  Okay?
[01:18:02.479 --> 01:18:07.662]  I just went around the country last week and laid all this information out.
[01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:19.096]  Literally to a T. It's almost like they studied my rallies, my Stop the Steal Caravan rallies, took notes, and then just went and investigated and now are showing all the evidence and getting ready to present it in a legal case.
[01:18:19.536 --> 01:18:22.018]  So, yeah, I'm feeling pretty damn good.
[01:18:24.579 --> 01:18:26.260]  Because it makes me irrelevant.
[01:18:27.501 --> 01:18:33.385]  The fact that we have patriots, the fact that we have lawyers and state representatives and legislatures.
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.101]  And people in the media, and finally, we're coming back.
[01:18:37.161 --> 01:18:37.881]  People are fighting.
[01:18:37.901 --> 01:18:39.261]  They're ready to fight this corruption.
[01:18:39.421 --> 01:18:40.502]  They're ready to call it out.
[01:18:40.662 --> 01:18:41.562]  They're not cowering.
[01:18:41.702 --> 01:18:42.622]  They're not living in fear.
[01:18:42.802 --> 01:18:47.023]  We're publicly laughing at CNN journalists at this press conference.
[01:18:47.403 --> 01:18:48.444]  Thank God!
[01:18:48.584 --> 01:18:50.584]  So yeah, I'm feeling pretty damn good.
[01:18:51.844 --> 01:18:53.485]  I'm feeling pretty damn good right now.
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:19:15.086]  When this historic, landmark press conference to save our republic, to save our rigged election, stop the banana republic, stop communist corruption, the fact that this sounds exactly like what InfoWars has been saying for months now, yeah, feels pretty damn good, not gonna lie.
[01:19:15.666 --> 01:19:17.947]  Let's go back live now as they're taking questions.
[01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:18.887]  Sidney Powell at the mic.
[01:19:19.292 --> 01:19:28.035]  Republican or Democratic candidates in any state across the country paid to have the system rigged to work for them.
[01:19:28.455 --> 01:19:31.296]  These people didn't do this just to take control.
[01:19:31.396 --> 01:19:33.957]  They make one heck of a lot of money off of it.
[01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:38.458]  Think about the global interest behind your own news organizations.
[01:19:38.978 --> 01:19:48.281]  Think about the pressure being brought to bear from the social media companies to shut down free speech on any challenge to the election.
[01:19:49.056 --> 01:20:01.928]  This is a massive, well-funded, coordinated effort to deprive we, the people of the United States, of our most fundamental right under the Constitution to preserve this republic that we all cherish.
[01:20:02.629 --> 01:20:04.551]  It is of the greatest concern.
[01:20:04.991 --> 01:20:07.033]  It is the 1775 of our generation and beyond.
[01:20:13.644 --> 01:20:13.944]  Yes.
[01:20:13.984 --> 01:20:14.885]  That is true.
[01:20:15.045 --> 01:20:23.653]  It is somehow related to this, but I do not know whether good guys got it or bad guys got it.
[01:20:33.491 --> 01:20:35.133]  I can only hear one person at the time.
[01:20:35.213 --> 01:20:37.256]  I'm going to take the one with the hands raised.
[01:20:37.296 --> 01:20:37.416]  Yes.
[01:20:45.623 --> 01:20:47.124]  Um, so question for you, Sydney.
[01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:58.449]  First, on the issue of the machines, do you plan to have, uh, are you seeking a court order to either feed or subpoena or just to gain access to any of these machines in any of these contested districts?
[01:20:58.489 --> 01:21:00.009]  Have you begun that process?
[01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:02.550]  Uh, and when can we expect a timeline on that?
[01:21:02.971 --> 01:21:08.193]  And then for you, Mr. Mayor, you mentioned in Wisconsin and in Michigan these issues of over-voting.
[01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:10.976]  Where can we learn more about this?
[01:21:11.296 --> 01:21:13.999]  You're saying 150, 200 percent?
[01:21:14.079 --> 01:21:16.222]  Up to 350 percent in some places.
[01:21:16.703 --> 01:21:18.645]  Where would we get access to that data?
[01:21:18.745 --> 01:21:24.351]  And then, to what extent were those people who showed up to vote in person?
[01:21:24.391 --> 01:21:28.076]  Because in Michigan, for example, they did allow same-day registration.
[01:21:29.429 --> 01:21:36.054]  Yes, well the same day registration causes problems with the vote signature and the registration itself.
[01:21:36.094 --> 01:21:41.818]  That's a whole different system that makes it impossible really to validate the signature.
[01:21:41.878 --> 01:21:44.680]  I mean, one person could sign the same name.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:53.146]  I mean, I could sign John Smith, I could sign Kay Smith, I could sign, you know, on both things and run 50 ballots that way.
[01:21:53.706 --> 01:21:56.148]  And we've got some evidence of that being done as well.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.081]  Rudy, do you want to speak to the other part of it?
[01:21:59.101 --> 01:22:00.021]  Sure.
[01:22:02.862 --> 01:22:07.344]  We have now three overvote analyses done.
[01:22:07.784 --> 01:22:13.207]  One for Pennsylvania, one for Michigan, and one for Wisconsin.
[01:22:13.287 --> 01:22:15.127]  We're in the process, oh I'm sorry, Georgia.
[01:22:15.147 --> 01:22:17.428]  We're in the process of doing the others.
[01:22:20.029 --> 01:22:23.651]  I'll check to see if it's appropriate for us to make it public.
[01:22:25.215 --> 01:22:27.037]  I imagine it is, but you could actually do it.
[01:22:27.677 --> 01:22:28.478]  You could do it yourself.
[01:22:28.878 --> 01:22:37.084]  A lot of the analysis comes from the real-time data that came through to the news medias the night and following the election.
[01:22:37.544 --> 01:22:41.727]  And some entrepreneurs out there have started crunching data themselves.
[01:22:41.767 --> 01:22:42.608]  Folks, that's the wild thing.
[01:22:42.628 --> 01:22:43.208]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:22:44.469 --> 01:22:46.191]  This information is publicly available.
[01:22:46.251 --> 01:22:49.714]  You can't go into the archives and basically see how they're obtaining it.
[01:22:49.754 --> 01:22:51.476]  That's what they're saying they're in the process of doing.
[01:22:51.796 --> 01:22:55.659]  But you can see how they have 350% vote turnout.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.863]  You can see how there's 200,000 votes magically for Biden at 3 a.m.
[01:22:59.883 --> 01:23:00.844]  in Wisconsin and Michigan.
[01:23:00.884 --> 01:23:05.208]  Again, I just did a whole tour on the southeast coast explaining all this.
[01:23:05.469 --> 01:23:09.913]  So yeah, I'm feeling kind of good that these freedom-loving
[01:23:11.397 --> 01:23:16.179]  Monsters of law are taking on the deep state, taking on the globalists, trying to save our country.
[01:23:16.219 --> 01:23:17.740]  Yeah, this is very relieving.
[01:23:19.981 --> 01:23:30.965]  And the vote tallies in the middle of the night after they've supposedly stopped counting, and that's when the Dominion operators went in and injected votes and changed the whole system.
[01:23:31.325 --> 01:23:40.209]  And it affects votes around the country, around the world, and all kinds of massive interests of globalists,
[01:23:41.087 --> 01:23:44.249]  Dictators, corporations, you name it.
[01:23:44.449 --> 01:23:49.773]  Everybody's against us except President Trump and we the people of the United States of America.
[01:23:50.393 --> 01:23:52.334]  You've spoken of unleashing the Kraken.
[01:23:52.835 --> 01:23:54.115]  Is the country ready for this?
[01:23:54.175 --> 01:23:57.517]  I mean, Americans should be astonished at what you're saying here today.
[01:23:57.858 --> 01:23:59.899]  Is the country on the verge of an electoral breakdown?
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.580]  We've already had it.
[01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:04.382]  We've already had that electoral breakdown.
[01:24:04.822 --> 01:24:09.165]  But the Constitution, as Jenna explains, has provisions in it for how you fix this.
[01:24:10.482 --> 01:24:19.470]  And there should never be another election conducted in this country, I don't care if it's for local dog catcher, using a Dominion machine and Smartmatic software.
[01:24:20.011 --> 01:24:29.700]  We've got to have an American company that uses paper ballots that we can all verify so every one of us can see that our vote is our vote.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.841]  Why are you not requesting
[01:24:38.383 --> 01:24:41.884]  This case is not only about, remember this case didn't begin with Dominion.
[01:24:42.404 --> 01:24:45.585]  This case began and this case can be proven the old-fashioned way.
[01:24:46.565 --> 01:24:59.308]  It can be proven based on just good old-fashioned Democratic tactics to go back to Mayor Daley in the 1960s when he held the vote back in Chicago so that he could elect John F. Kennedy.
[01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:12.283]  Or, as recently as last year, when they held a vote back in Palm Beach County and Broward County in order to see if they could steal that election for the Senate and Governor, and then got caught manufacturing ballots.
[01:25:12.903 --> 01:25:15.385]  Democrats have been doing this for years on a small scale.
[01:25:16.106 --> 01:25:25.131]  When they passed the mail-in voter statute, which all of a sudden multiplied by 10 times,
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:29.782]  The number of mail-in votes, they realized they could have a field day.
[01:25:30.142 --> 01:25:36.867]  They could do precisely what Jimmy Carter and Secretary Baker warned us about.
[01:25:37.827 --> 01:25:41.910]  All you have to do is own an election board, and you can get away with it.
[01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:53.597]  And unlike what Sidney is talking about, where you could have a paper trail, a paper ballot, I tried to point out to you, the minute that you separate the outer envelope from the ballot, you can no longer trace it.
[01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:58.437]  Which is why the count, whatever the count in Georgia today is, is totally ridiculous.
[01:25:58.677 --> 01:26:01.018]  They're counting the same fraudulent ballots.
[01:26:01.038 --> 01:26:07.160]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, our network feed, the InfoWars network feed is skipping breaks.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:10.622]  Local radio or satellite stations may still be going to those breaks.
[01:26:11.122 --> 01:26:16.384]  So we may be breaking, we'll be right back, but for the InfoWars network feeds, we're skipping breaks and sticking with this historic press conference.
[01:26:18.305 --> 01:26:21.426]  Do you believe you can overturn this election, or is it about something bigger to you?
[01:26:22.788 --> 01:26:24.249]  Well, it is about something.
[01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:28.393]  Let's go from the big picture to the smaller picture.
[01:26:29.114 --> 01:26:37.561]  The most important thing here is that this has been a massive attack on the integrity of the voting system in the greatest democracy on earth.
[01:26:38.422 --> 01:26:45.688]  The people who did this have committed one of the worst crimes that I've ever seen or observed.
[01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:48.671]  One of the things we're the most proud of in this country
[01:26:49.326 --> 01:26:53.067]  Is that we've been such a long-standing democracy based on the right to vote.
[01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.049]  They have trashed the right to vote.
[01:26:56.409 --> 01:26:57.649]  They've dishonored the right to vote.
[01:26:57.889 --> 01:27:00.950]  They've destroyed the right to vote in their greed for power and money.
[01:27:01.851 --> 01:27:02.791]  And there's no doubt about it.
[01:27:03.591 --> 01:27:08.213]  This was not an individual idea of 10 or 12 Democrat bosses.
[01:27:09.234 --> 01:27:10.054]  This is a plan.
[01:27:10.674 --> 01:27:12.755]  You would have to be a fool not to realize that.
[01:27:13.570 --> 01:27:21.297]  They do the same thing, in exactly the same way, in 10 big, Democrat-controlled, in most cases, crooked city.
[01:27:21.697 --> 01:27:33.407]  And when I say crooked city, go look at how many of their officials have gone to jail in the last 20, or 30, or 40, or 50, or 60 years that they have dominated and destroyed those cities.
[01:27:34.648 --> 01:27:36.910]  They picked the places where they could get away with it.
[01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:39.072]  They picked the places where
[01:27:39.835 --> 01:27:43.738]  Whether or not Republicans testified to something, judges would just dismiss it.
[01:27:44.558 --> 01:27:46.319]  Because judges are appointed politically.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.841]  And too many of them are hacks.
[01:27:49.722 --> 01:27:57.006]  They pick places where they could get a sheriff that refused to enforce a court order.
[01:27:58.227 --> 01:28:05.232]  When we got a court order that we could be 10 feet closer, our representatives were told, if you try to do it, I'll arrest you.
[01:28:14.641 --> 01:28:17.663]  Part one, it began as a national conspiracy.
[01:28:18.404 --> 01:28:20.825]  Clearly, that evidence emerged very, very quickly.
[01:28:21.446 --> 01:28:30.692]  The minute I saw that it was the same thing in 10 states, just using logic, I said, this can't be an accident.
[01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:33.954]  And then what I was surprised about is the dimension of it.
[01:28:34.995 --> 01:28:35.195]  I mean,
[01:28:36.684 --> 01:28:40.306]  Not inspecting almost 700,000 ballots is astounding!
[01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:48.670]  Honestly, I don't know what Joe Biden is aware of or not aware of.
[01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:54.033]  And I mean that as a lawyer, not trying to be not trying to be cute.
[01:28:54.553 --> 01:28:55.153]  I've watched him.
[01:28:55.193 --> 01:28:55.854]  I've observed him.
[01:29:00.016 --> 01:29:01.416]  I honestly don't know how much he's aware.
[01:29:01.476 --> 01:29:04.598]  I don't know how much he decides and how much things are decided for him.
[01:29:05.111 --> 01:29:09.255]  So I... Let me address one other thing to your question about the process.
[01:29:09.415 --> 01:29:12.778]  Your question is fundamentally flawed when you're asking where is the evidence.
[01:29:13.119 --> 01:29:15.781]  You clearly don't understand the legal process.
[01:29:15.861 --> 01:29:22.848]  What we have asked for in the court is to not have the certification of false results.
[01:29:23.508 --> 01:29:28.690]  And so to say hold on a minute, we have evidence that we will present to the court.
[01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:32.712]  We haven't had the opportunity yet to present that to the court.
[01:29:32.772 --> 01:29:37.754]  We're giving you an overview and a preview of what we've discovered, but no court yet has
[01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:40.932]  We've had that opportunity.
[01:29:41.092 --> 01:29:49.800]  And we have fraud allegations pending, so what we've asked for are temporary restraining orders or injunctions to not certify false results.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:30:01.670]  We're very happy that Michigan, the reason we dismissed that lawsuit today, is because the Michigan county in Wayne County, they're not going to certify that because 71% of counties have inconsistent data.
[01:30:02.011 --> 01:30:04.573]  No person in this room or in this country
[01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:08.576]  We have to make sure that the results are accurate and that's what we will prove.
[01:30:33.826 --> 01:30:37.007]  Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, and others, they say they're going to take two more questions.
[01:30:38.267 --> 01:30:52.229]  When the Secretary of State of Michigan never bothered to find out that the votes in her state were being counted in Germany by a Venezuelan company, and you want me to take her seriously or him seriously?
[01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:55.070]  I mean, I was in government.
[01:30:57.050 --> 01:31:00.731]  If I were the governor of that state, I'd fire everybody that was involved in this election.
[01:31:01.488 --> 01:31:17.580]  They didn't come and tell me that my state was going to be embarrassed, made a fool of, because I'm sending my votes of people in Michigan over to Germany to be counted by a company that is owned by people who are allies of Maduro and Chavez.
[01:31:18.201 --> 01:31:21.163]  By the way, Carolyn Maloney, who wrote that, is my Congresswoman.
[01:31:22.284 --> 01:31:23.504]  A Democrat pointed that out.
[01:31:25.006 --> 01:31:28.048]  They didn't do the darndest bit of due diligence.
[01:31:29.033 --> 01:31:33.594]  If you bought a $10 million company, you would have done more due diligence to that.
[01:31:34.575 --> 01:31:37.276]  Maybe they're incompetent, or maybe they didn't want to know.
[01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:44.858]  But you're not going to have me take seriously anything that comes from anyone involved in the election the way it was conducted in Michigan.
[01:31:44.878 --> 01:31:48.099]  But you guys are saying that those votes have been rescinded.
[01:31:48.119 --> 01:31:48.359]  They haven't.
[01:31:48.559 --> 01:31:50.900]  The Secretary of State there said that they can't be.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.061]  The Secretary of State can say whatever she wants to say.
[01:31:53.121 --> 01:31:54.121]  Of course she's going to say that.
[01:31:54.441 --> 01:31:55.161]  She's a Democrat.
[01:31:55.842 --> 01:31:56.862]  She could also credit
[01:31:57.836 --> 01:31:59.317]  The affidavits of the two people.
[01:32:00.238 --> 01:32:03.280]  And say that the board is tied and therefore the vote hasn't been certified.
[01:32:04.041 --> 01:32:06.062]  So because she's a Democrat, she's saying that.
[01:32:07.563 --> 01:32:08.964]  Do you think she has any credibility?
[01:32:09.445 --> 01:32:11.666]  Having run the kind of election they ran in Michigan?
[01:32:12.867 --> 01:32:15.109]  You think anyone in that government has credibility?
[01:32:15.589 --> 01:32:18.812]  After using a machine and fooling their citizens?
[01:32:19.052 --> 01:32:24.516]  There can't be a person in Michigan who thought their vote was being sent outside the United States so somebody could play with it.
[01:32:25.942 --> 01:32:30.144]  I mean... And by the way, the Gateway Pundit has now published the numbers they've been reporting.
[01:32:30.604 --> 01:32:37.528]  Folks, in all these counties, the vote comes back from overseas and it's the exact same ratio split, the exact same percentage split.
[01:32:37.848 --> 01:32:40.449]  A literal zero percent possibility.
[01:32:45.551 --> 01:32:48.293]  We're not... We are limited in what we can do.
[01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:49.293]  We're not the FBI.
[01:32:49.753 --> 01:32:50.474]  We're not the government.
[01:32:50.574 --> 01:32:52.735]  We don't have that kind of subpoena power.
[01:32:53.553 --> 01:32:55.974]  We don't have the power to just go subpoena anything we want.
[01:32:56.514 --> 01:32:57.214]  The government does.
[01:32:58.434 --> 01:33:01.855]  We would have to subpoena in line with a case.
[01:33:02.635 --> 01:33:08.116]  Our first case, we're asking for that authority in Pennsylvania and in Michigan.
[01:33:09.457 --> 01:33:11.117]  But you have to get that authority from the court.
[01:33:11.137 --> 01:33:12.017]  We're private citizens.
[01:33:12.077 --> 01:33:12.778]  We're not the government.
[01:33:13.818 --> 01:33:18.859]  If I were the government, like I used to be, there'd probably be a lot of people arrested by now.
[01:33:20.839 --> 01:33:22.200]  Because there's plenty of probable cause.
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.622]  Plenty of probable cause.
[01:33:25.622 --> 01:33:34.889]  You alleged that Donald Trump has won by a landslide.
[01:33:34.969 --> 01:33:41.053]  We've seen that a lot of your lawsuits and in fact lawyers have been kind of dropping like flies.
[01:33:41.133 --> 01:33:45.977]  What do you say to those people who call this a rescue 2.0 just on the other side?
[01:33:46.097 --> 01:33:47.418]  Why didn't this end also?
[01:33:49.279 --> 01:33:51.260]  What fake network do you come from?
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:53.361]  I don't come from a fake network.
[01:33:53.441 --> 01:33:55.282]  In fact, I am completely independent.
[01:33:55.342 --> 01:33:56.543]  I have no one above my head.
[01:33:56.763 --> 01:33:57.403]  Oh my goodness.
[01:33:57.723 --> 01:34:01.985]  Well, first of all, first of all, our cases haven't been dismissed.
[01:34:02.285 --> 01:34:06.547]  We only have... Look at the plaintiffs who were involved in this.
[01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:07.768]  It's not our case, ma'am.
[01:34:08.408 --> 01:34:09.429]  Don't lie to people.
[01:34:10.849 --> 01:34:13.510]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, you are lying.
[01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:15.111]  You're lying.
[01:34:15.872 --> 01:34:16.592]  You're lying.
[01:34:18.001 --> 01:34:18.961]  Well, continue to lie.
[01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:22.222]  I'm not going to... Ma'am.
[01:34:22.262 --> 01:34:22.542]  Ma'am.
[01:34:22.742 --> 01:34:22.942]  Ma'am.
[01:34:23.262 --> 01:34:23.462]  Ma'am.
[01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:24.522]  Ma'am.
[01:34:24.923 --> 01:34:25.123]  Ma'am.
[01:34:25.463 --> 01:34:25.763]  Okay.
[01:34:26.123 --> 01:34:27.143]  Let me answer the question.
[01:34:27.163 --> 01:34:29.003]  Let me answer the question.
[01:34:29.484 --> 01:34:32.884]  The answer to the question is, we don't have a lot of lawsuits.
[01:34:32.924 --> 01:34:33.885]  We only have three.
[01:34:34.505 --> 01:34:37.405]  Our lawsuits have not been dropped all over the place.
[01:34:37.925 --> 01:34:41.246]  We... Okay.
[01:34:41.266 --> 01:34:43.007]  Well, you're a totally discourteous person.
[01:34:43.087 --> 01:34:44.187]  I'm going to finish my answer.
[01:34:44.867 --> 01:34:45.007]  So...
[01:34:47.334 --> 01:34:48.294]  I'm going to finish my answer.
[01:34:48.335 --> 01:34:50.176]  The fact is we have very, very few lawsuits.
[01:34:50.216 --> 01:34:53.799]  The lawsuits you're talking about have been brought by private individuals and groups.
[01:34:54.359 --> 01:34:56.421]  Most of them were dismissed for lack of standing.
[01:34:57.062 --> 01:35:00.585]  Probably correctly, because they were brought before the election took place.
[01:35:01.285 --> 01:35:02.466]  The election is now over.
[01:35:03.007 --> 01:35:08.091]  The only lawsuit we have withdrawn is the one where we got the relief that we wanted, and that's the one in Michigan.
[01:35:08.351 --> 01:35:13.235]  We also have another lawsuit in Michigan that will accomplish the other objectives of what we want to do in Michigan.
[01:35:13.655 --> 01:35:15.517]  So it's silly to have two competing lawsuits.
[01:35:16.272 --> 01:35:20.075]  The only lawyer that left a case left because he was threatened.
[01:35:20.616 --> 01:35:21.677]  His family was threatened.
[01:35:21.917 --> 01:35:23.078]  His children were threatened.
[01:35:23.839 --> 01:35:24.940]  And so was the other lawyer.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:26.401]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:35:26.521 --> 01:35:36.890]  We have a little difficulty getting lawyers because our lawyers get threatened with being killed because of the ridiculous way in which you cover this and the ridiculous way in which you cover
[01:35:39.094 --> 01:35:45.037]  I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about everybody, but I get a pretty good sense from the way you handle yourself, how you cover it.
[01:35:45.057 --> 01:35:46.758]  Alright, we're finished with you now.
[01:35:47.418 --> 01:35:48.438]  One last question.
[01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:52.700]  One last question from a... One last question.
[01:35:53.941 --> 01:35:55.221]  One last question.
[01:35:56.322 --> 01:35:57.062]  One last question.
[01:35:57.502 --> 01:36:00.064]  From a reasonable, civil person.
[01:36:00.104 --> 01:36:00.524]  You are not.
[01:36:00.664 --> 01:36:00.844]  Yes.
[01:36:02.572 --> 01:36:03.272]  No, she isn't.
[01:36:03.812 --> 01:36:04.653]  Well, we'll find out.
[01:36:04.673 --> 01:36:07.093]  I'm from the Daily Caller, for the record.
[01:36:07.113 --> 01:36:07.553]  Oh, there we go.
[01:36:07.573 --> 01:36:14.355]  If the courts don't let you present these cases like Jenna just said, will you give the entire bulk of the evidence to the media to review?
[01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:19.797]  And if so, when are you going to drag this thing out like the Hunter Biden hard drive again?
[01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:22.410]  We're not going to drag it out.
[01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:25.552]  I mean, it's ridiculous for you to say we're dragging it out.
[01:36:26.152 --> 01:36:31.996]  Al Gore had a lot more time than we've had, and we've had two weeks to investigate.
[01:36:32.437 --> 01:36:35.559]  So that's also completely unfair to say we're dragging it out.
[01:36:36.319 --> 01:36:41.343]  Also, if we're going to present things in court, if we present it to you, judges are not going to be very happy with us.
[01:36:41.703 --> 01:36:48.608]  And finally, I have to tell you, our witnesses don't want to be exposed to the tender mercies of a vicious press.
[01:36:49.625 --> 01:36:54.167]  I have great difficulty getting those witnesses that I did reveal to allow me to do it.
[01:36:54.747 --> 01:36:55.528]  They don't trust you.
[01:36:55.768 --> 01:36:56.528]  They don't like you.
[01:36:57.008 --> 01:37:02.811]  They think you put their lives in jeopardy with the spin that you put on what's going on here and with the unfairness in which you cover it.
[01:37:03.371 --> 01:37:06.492]  It's not easy to reveal the things that they tell me.
[01:37:06.512 --> 01:37:07.133]  So the answer is no?
[01:37:07.513 --> 01:37:14.636]  The answer is I can't do it because I can't I can't put a witness's life in jeopardy or a person who thinks there's life in jeopardy.
[01:37:14.916 --> 01:37:17.377]  This woman tells me we have lawyers dropping out of the case.
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:26.524]  We have lawyers dropping out of the case because they're being threatened with destruction of their careers, destruction of their livelihood, and in some cases, destruction of their lives.
[01:37:27.024 --> 01:37:32.586]  That comes about because of the hysterical way in which you have covered Donald Trump and his administration.
[01:37:33.227 --> 01:37:34.267]  But we're going to change all that.
[01:37:34.747 --> 01:37:35.628]  We're going to go to courts.
[01:37:35.728 --> 01:37:36.728]  We're going to prove it in court.
[01:37:37.509 --> 01:37:39.670]  I would love to release all the information that I have.
[01:37:39.930 --> 01:37:41.050]  I would love to give it to you all.
[01:37:42.011 --> 01:37:43.691]  Except, most of you wouldn't cover it.
[01:37:44.052 --> 01:37:44.732]  A few of you would.
[01:37:45.498 --> 01:37:47.920]  And then we'd have half the American people probably informed.
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:58.728]  The censorship that is going on in this country right now by big tech and by big media is almost as dangerous as the election fraud that we're revealing.
[01:37:59.048 --> 01:38:00.049]  Maybe just as dangerous.
[01:38:00.449 --> 01:38:02.010]  We're headed to a very bad place.
[01:38:02.651 --> 01:38:06.854]  And it is not inappropriate that a Venezuelan company countered our votes.
[01:38:07.374 --> 01:38:07.754]  Thank you.
[01:38:12.097 --> 01:38:12.418]  Wow!
[01:38:14.178 --> 01:38:15.439]  Wow, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:16.739 --> 01:38:18.921]  That was incredible.
[01:38:20.021 --> 01:38:21.002]  That was historic.
[01:38:21.282 --> 01:38:23.063]  That is going to resonate worldwide.
[01:38:24.003 --> 01:38:33.088]  That was a meteor impact level on the American body politic and the world.
[01:38:34.829 --> 01:38:35.849]  And this is just the beginning.
[01:38:39.071 --> 01:38:39.952]  Here's what we're going to do.
[01:38:41.032 --> 01:38:42.433]  We've skipped all of our breaks.
[01:38:43.402 --> 01:38:44.362]  We need to pay the bills.
[01:38:46.423 --> 01:38:56.545]  When we come back, I'm going to go through all of the notes here that I took listening to that press conference and lay it all out and what it means and what's coming next.
[01:38:58.065 --> 01:39:06.007]  But we got to take the first break that we've taken today because we've just been covering this historic press conference with Trump's legal team and wow.
[01:39:09.408 --> 01:39:11.168]  I mean, I even need a minute to just kind of
[01:39:13.824 --> 01:39:16.065]  Gather my feet here, but folks.
[01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:20.167]  That's just incredible.
[01:39:20.347 --> 01:39:20.867]  I can't even.
[01:39:21.947 --> 01:39:22.488]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:23.308 --> 01:39:24.268]  We haven't even plugged today.
[01:39:24.348 --> 01:39:25.289]  We've been skipping breaks.
[01:39:26.849 --> 01:39:33.932]  We've now funded and launched this whole Stop the Steal Caravan that's been going on for two weeks now with Jones rallying people in Atlanta.
[01:39:33.972 --> 01:39:35.253]  Going to be out there again Saturday.
[01:39:35.573 --> 01:39:37.774]  I think I'm going to be rallying again Saturday here in Austin.
[01:39:37.794 --> 01:39:39.815]  In fact, I might as well just come out and say it.
[01:39:39.995 --> 01:39:42.796]  We're going to be doing it again Saturday here at the State Capitol in Austin.
[01:39:43.776 --> 01:39:44.677]  They did it last Saturday.
[01:39:44.697 --> 01:39:45.237]  It was huge.
[01:39:45.377 --> 01:39:46.538]  We didn't even do it or promote it.
[01:39:46.718 --> 01:39:47.898]  I'll be out there Saturday.
[01:39:48.439 --> 01:39:49.159]  Come out and join me.
[01:39:49.179 --> 01:39:50.540]  State Capitol here in Austin at noon.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:53.421]  Folks, InfoWarsStore.com is how we do all this.

[01:40:13.052 --> 01:40:13.572]  We have to air it.
[01:40:33.598 --> 01:40:37.741]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:40:37.922 --> 01:40:43.286]  Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex here in the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[01:40:43.406 --> 01:40:45.768]  Alex is on the road in Atlanta.
[01:40:45.788 --> 01:40:48.270]  He'll be rejoining us here shortly.
[01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:57.618]  I have major big league duties to fulfill right now in response to that landmark historic press conference that we just witnessed.
[01:40:57.638 --> 01:41:00.900]  But folks, I have to reiterate this because we wouldn't be here
[01:41:01.775 --> 01:41:03.836]  If it wasn't for your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:41:03.896 --> 01:41:06.138]  We just skipped, I think, five or six breaks.
[01:41:06.478 --> 01:41:07.699]  That's money that's not coming in.
[01:41:08.819 --> 01:41:27.550]  So, we prioritized and said, we have to cover this press conference in its entirety, skip the breaks, whatever the financial pitfalls may be, but we're relying and trusting that you're gonna make up for that by going to InfoWarsStore.com today and taking advantage of some of the great specials like 50% off DNA Force+, 50% off bodies,

[01:41:51.105 --> 01:41:52.726]  We just skipped like six or seven breaks.
[01:41:52.786 --> 01:41:53.927]  That's money not coming in.
[01:41:54.487 --> 01:42:01.732]  So please, we're relying on you to make up for that by going to InfoWarsTore.com today and doing some shopping.
[01:42:03.172 --> 01:42:06.794]  Now, I've got a ton of news here to cover.
[01:42:06.814 --> 01:42:13.176]  I got a ton of more news coming in, but let me go through my notes here.
[01:42:15.677 --> 01:42:21.359]  What we just heard, saw, and witnessed there at that press conference nearly went two hours.
[01:42:22.279 --> 01:42:28.021]  Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis doing the speaking.
[01:42:28.241 --> 01:42:31.062]  I mean, Jenna Ellis, talk about a rising star.
[01:42:35.063 --> 01:42:47.967]  But I said this before and I'm going to say it again because kind of the easiest bellwether, the most organic bellwether for me to just see if I'm engaging or what people are thinking about is just my incoming messages.
[01:42:48.547 --> 01:42:54.569]  And from yesterday to today, with my coverage, people are saying, hey, you sound a little more relaxed today.
[01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:55.530]  You sound more confident.
[01:42:56.630 --> 01:42:57.190]  What's going on?
[01:42:57.230 --> 01:42:57.750]  That's good.
[01:42:58.010 --> 01:43:01.472]  You're not as upset as you were yesterday or whatever words they're using.
[01:43:01.612 --> 01:43:02.332]  I'm saying, yeah, well,
[01:43:03.416 --> 01:43:14.259]  I'm sitting here listening to this press conference and I've got Rudy Giuliani, I've got Sidney Powell, I've got Jenna Ellis on Trump's legal team having this press conference that's being watched worldwide.
[01:43:14.719 --> 01:43:16.979]  Right side broadcasting is streaming it as well.
[01:43:17.439 --> 01:43:19.640]  We had millions of people tuning into it live.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.381]  I'm sure right side broadcasting has had hundreds of thousands like they normally do.
[01:43:23.641 --> 01:43:27.322]  So people are getting this information and it sounds exactly like InfoWars!
[01:43:28.806 --> 01:43:40.070]  It sounds like they just took bullet points from my Stop the Steal Caravan rallies, wrote them down, went and did the actual legal investigation to find the proof, get the affidavits, and now they have it all!
[01:43:41.250 --> 01:43:44.031]  So yeah, there's a bit of a relief factor there, folks.
[01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:56.975]  When you're in the arena, fighting, feeling like you're alone in the arena, and then all of a sudden the troops come in and you get a little, you know, chance to catch a wind in the middle of the ring, yeah, that's a pretty relieving factor there.
[01:43:58.991 --> 01:43:59.912]  So that's incredible.
[01:44:02.493 --> 01:44:03.214]  That's incredible.
[01:44:05.015 --> 01:44:08.797]  Jenna Ellis used a phrase multiple times that I think is key.
[01:44:09.838 --> 01:44:15.041]  The election results, the process of our election is irredeemable.
[01:44:15.882 --> 01:44:16.542]  Irredeemable.
[01:44:17.463 --> 01:44:18.543]  It's fake, folks.
[01:44:19.544 --> 01:44:22.066]  We haven't had elections in this country for a long time.
[01:44:22.106 --> 01:44:23.787]  We've had selections.
[01:44:25.413 --> 01:44:34.975]  And just by sheer will and voter turnout alone, we've been able to keep some actual patriotic people in government.
[01:44:35.055 --> 01:44:37.276]  We were actually able to get Donald Trump in there.
[01:44:37.956 --> 01:44:41.637]  That's with all their theft, with all their stealing, with the rigged voting machines.
[01:44:42.097 --> 01:44:49.939]  But see, they knew they had to go 10 times as much as they had in 2016 to rig this election against Trump, so they did it, and they got caught, it was so obvious.
[01:44:51.339 --> 01:44:53.740]  But irredeemable, the way we have been
[01:44:54.938 --> 01:45:01.420]  Electing our officials and the process and the technology we've been using is irredeemable.
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:07.643]  It must be ended forever if we're going to save this republic and we're going to save our elections.
[01:45:09.203 --> 01:45:09.823]  Irredeemable.
[01:45:10.063 --> 01:45:12.064]  Very choice word by Jenna Ellis.
[01:45:13.045 --> 01:45:13.705]  Sidney Powell.
[01:45:14.905 --> 01:45:18.086]  Again, it's like they were taking notes from the Stop the Steal caravan rallies.
[01:45:18.447 --> 01:45:19.447]  I'm not even saying that's the case.
[01:45:20.410 --> 01:45:22.032]  We're just speaking the truth.
[01:45:22.592 --> 01:45:32.984]  So it's like, wow, someone else with a bigger platform, with a lot more power and pull, is speaking the truth and seeking the truth and telling the American people, thank God.
[01:45:33.464 --> 01:45:35.727]  It's like a glass of ice water in the desert.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:40.223]  So Sidney Powell says the world is watching.
[01:45:41.184 --> 01:45:41.845]  And she's right.
[01:45:41.945 --> 01:45:44.627]  The world is watching.
[01:45:45.088 --> 01:45:51.974]  And the world is waiting to see if America can defeat this tyranny and then they will get the clarion call and they will fight as well.
[01:45:52.955 --> 01:45:57.800]  And we will expose the rigged voting machines so that other countries can have fair elections again as well too.
[01:46:00.796 --> 01:46:05.717]  Sidney Powell said, we should never have another election with Dominion or Smartmatic voting machines.
[01:46:06.197 --> 01:46:06.818]  Bingo.
[01:46:07.658 --> 01:46:08.318]  Bingo.
[01:46:09.158 --> 01:46:10.839]  They're irredeemable.
[01:46:11.939 --> 01:46:13.479]  They rig elections.
[01:46:13.719 --> 01:46:15.780]  Every American should be up in arms about this.
[01:46:19.661 --> 01:46:22.201]  Rudy Giuliani said our elections were hacked.
[01:46:22.862 --> 01:46:24.062]  They were hacked.
[01:46:25.482 --> 01:46:26.142]  They were hacked.
[01:46:26.182 --> 01:46:27.483]  These are electronic voting machines.
[01:46:27.523 --> 01:46:28.463]  They get hacked remotely.
[01:46:30.578 --> 01:46:37.120]  And this is why this is going to be such a tough legal fight, because folks, they can't do recounts, they don't even have ballots to recount it.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:47.484]  Rudy Giuliani even showed you, they throw out the ballots, they input it into a machine, and then all you have is that machine data that can be rigged remotely, changed remotely, deleted remotely, inputted remotely.
[01:46:48.264 --> 01:46:50.805]  So it's all about exposing these rigged voting machines, folks.
[01:46:50.825 --> 01:46:52.365]  That is the number one key.
[01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:59.748]  And for all the people in the media that cried Russian collusion for four years, you disingenuous, dirtbag liberals,
[01:47:01.428 --> 01:47:09.534]  Better be just as upset with the foreign interference in 2020 from China, from Germany, from Spain, from Venezuela.
[01:47:10.314 --> 01:47:16.339]  Now, they probably won't be, but again that shows you their giant fraud.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:23.924]  Rudy Giuliani described this election theft as one of the biggest crimes in history.
[01:47:26.046 --> 01:47:30.229]  Sidney Powell echoed that behind him saying, in world history.
[01:47:31.618 --> 01:47:34.400]  Giuliani said if he was still in government, people would be arrested.
[01:47:35.501 --> 01:47:39.885]  I'd like to nominate Rudy Giuliani to head of the Department of Justice.
[01:47:42.587 --> 01:47:49.432]  Rudy Giuliani said that his legal team and people involved in this, including the people signing affidavits that end up going public, are receiving death threats.
[01:47:49.732 --> 01:47:58.119]  Yes, folks, we are dealing with a criminal cabal, a worldwide gangster mafia, at which Joe Biden sits at the head table.
[01:48:02.364 --> 01:48:04.328]  I believe they want this to go to the Supreme Court.
[01:48:04.368 --> 01:48:08.154]  Rudy Giuliani has hinted at that, as has Sidney Powell.
[01:48:09.175 --> 01:48:18.578]  And I think that's because their goal here, folks, is to expose these rigged elections and then cement that we will never have anything like this again in our country with a Supreme Court decision.
[01:48:18.698 --> 01:48:21.419]  It's a big risk, but it's going for the home run.
[01:48:21.479 --> 01:48:22.319]  It's going for broke.
[01:48:23.199 --> 01:48:26.040]  And if that's their mentality, then I understand it and I'm behind it.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:34.122]  And I just hope that there are people of the nine Supreme Court judges that have enough integrity and wherewithal to realize how important this is.
[01:48:34.542 --> 01:48:36.263]  They shouldn't be politicized, but we know they are.
[01:48:37.148 --> 01:48:46.875]  To put their politics aside and realize this is all about our election system and fair elections worldwide and exposing corruption.
[01:48:48.315 --> 01:48:54.680]  And I do think it will ultimately end up there and that will ultimately end up being the case and it may take a few months for us to get to that point so it's going to be
[01:48:55.854 --> 01:48:56.835]  Long and drawn out.
[01:48:57.675 --> 01:49:13.343]  Now, I expect, and the crew's already telling me that Fox News is already spinning this, but CNN and MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, Washington Post, New York Times, get ready, they're all gonna say, no evidence, no evidence, no evidence, no evidence.
[01:49:13.563 --> 01:49:19.826]  Big Tech is gonna censor that press conference, censor any clips, censor anything and say, no evidence, no evidence, no evidence.
[01:49:20.126 --> 01:49:22.788]  That's their big move is, no evidence, no evidence, no evidence.
[01:49:23.128 --> 01:49:25.269]  Even though we have all the evidence.
[01:49:26.553 --> 01:49:28.715]  It's the biggest gaslight in history.
[01:49:28.755 --> 01:49:29.896]  It's the biggest lie in history.
[01:49:29.916 --> 01:49:31.337]  And you say, well what about all the other lies?
[01:49:31.757 --> 01:49:36.441]  Every big lie they tell is stacked on top of that lie and therefore bigger than that lie.
[01:49:37.983 --> 01:49:39.964]  There's so much evidence, you're swimming in it.
[01:49:40.565 --> 01:49:42.927]  And they'll say, no evidence, so get ready for that narrative.
[01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:51.334]  And so, they called out Michigan hard, the governor, the secretary of state.
[01:49:52.975 --> 01:49:54.857]  They should be arrested for what they've done, but
[01:49:57.113 --> 01:50:07.061]  Ladies and gentlemen, what is this crushing defeat of the left and the Democrats and the moron liberals going to look like in two months?
[01:50:09.423 --> 01:50:13.606]  This is going to be worse than 2016 now a hundred times.
[01:50:14.127 --> 01:50:18.010]  It's going to be worse when they had no Russian collusion and no evidence and no
[01:50:19.707 --> 01:50:23.229]  Witnesses, it's gonna be worse than their two-time failed impeachment.
[01:50:23.269 --> 01:50:26.311]  It's gonna be worse than us getting Kavanaugh in, Coney Barrett in.
[01:50:26.331 --> 01:50:28.572]  It's gonna be all of it combined times ten, folks.
[01:50:29.292 --> 01:50:35.996]  They are really celebrating this cheat over us, because it feels even better that they cheated and got away with it, because that's even more empowering.
[01:50:37.517 --> 01:50:37.697]  So...
[01:50:39.602 --> 01:50:43.364]  And there's going to be rallies all across the nation this Saturday at every state capitol.
[01:50:43.524 --> 01:50:44.964]  In fact, I announced it last segment.
[01:50:45.304 --> 01:50:46.985]  We don't even have really the crew to properly do this.
[01:50:47.085 --> 01:50:47.766]  I don't give a damn.
[01:50:48.086 --> 01:50:53.148]  Organic grassroots, come out to the Austin state capitol building on Saturday at noon, okay?
[01:50:53.868 --> 01:50:55.249]  Come out, wave your flag.
[01:50:55.769 --> 01:50:57.630]  Let's just dominate this culturally.
[01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:59.270]  Let's dominate this in the streets.
[01:50:59.471 --> 01:51:01.011]  Let's dominate this in the courtroom.
[01:51:01.231 --> 01:51:02.912]  We all must be activated now.
[01:51:03.132 --> 01:51:05.013]  The future of the republic depends on it.
[01:51:07.938 --> 01:51:13.641]  These developments are so historic, they're so impactful, and we're right here at the core of it all.
[01:51:18.403 --> 01:51:27.668]  And America, in the next two months, Americans, in the next two months, have a decision to make.
[01:51:28.569 --> 01:51:29.269]  It's very simple.
[01:51:30.670 --> 01:51:37.093]  The issues are complex, the data is complex, the analysis is complex, the history is complex, but the decision is simple.
[01:51:40.686 --> 01:52:00.368]  Either the United States of America, the republic, the will for independence and self-government lives on as a worldwide example for human freedom and liberty in a free market capitalist system, in a democratic republic, and we go on as free Americans, and we continue
[01:52:01.741 --> 01:52:10.706]  Our manifest destiny of prosperity and private ownership of land and business and in a free market with no government interference.
[01:52:12.167 --> 01:52:15.368]  And we continue that prosperity into the future as a worldwide example.
[01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.869]  Or!
[01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:19.070]  It's done.
[01:52:19.330 --> 01:52:19.711]  It's over.
[01:52:20.311 --> 01:52:21.191]  Your freedoms are gone.
[01:52:21.732 --> 01:52:22.872]  Your self-government is gone.
[01:52:23.092 --> 01:52:25.994]  Your will will be arrested.
[01:52:27.807 --> 01:52:29.248]  You will no longer have elections.
[01:52:29.489 --> 01:52:31.731]  You will no longer have private property.
[01:52:31.791 --> 01:52:33.352]  You will no longer have a free market.
[01:52:33.372 --> 01:52:34.733]  You will no longer have a business.
[01:52:34.833 --> 01:52:36.275]  You'll have nothing.
[01:52:36.335 --> 01:52:37.796]  You'll have whatever the government gives you.
[01:52:38.457 --> 01:52:38.997]  And that's it.
[01:52:41.099 --> 01:52:41.539]  And that's it.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:42.400]  That's your choice.
[01:52:43.161 --> 01:52:44.142]  Freedom or tyranny.
[01:52:45.243 --> 01:52:46.304]  Freedom or tyranny.
[01:52:51.248 --> 01:52:52.749]  It's all in the balance in the next two months.
[01:52:52.890 --> 01:52:53.190]  All of it.
[01:52:57.762 --> 01:53:11.346]  And I'm still so perplexed and stunned at the modern day left as we view it, whether it's Antifa or BLM or all of these other suckers that fall for fake news and hate Trump.
[01:53:12.867 --> 01:53:13.967]  It's not even about Trump.
[01:53:17.328 --> 01:53:24.351]  And I've always held out this weird hope, even if it's a tiny little fraction of a percentage, like the chances you'll die of COVID, like 0.001%.
[01:53:28.576 --> 01:53:44.142]  Maybe these people will finally get it, how they've been screwed over, how they've been fooled, how they've been duped, and they'll stop being mad at the people that are trying to expose it, and instead turn and be mad at the people that duped them, fooled them, and then wanted to enslave them.
[01:53:44.862 --> 01:53:47.163]  I still have a small smattering of hope that's possible, but
[01:53:49.175 --> 01:53:50.176]  They're full in, man.
[01:53:50.336 --> 01:53:51.117]  They're full in.
[01:53:51.157 --> 01:53:52.538]  They love the Biden steal.
[01:53:52.598 --> 01:53:54.299]  They love the Biden child molest.
[01:53:54.559 --> 01:53:56.981]  They love the Biden collusion with foreign countries.
[01:53:57.021 --> 01:53:57.962]  They love it all.
[01:53:58.162 --> 01:53:59.744]  They love the mainstream media.
[01:53:59.784 --> 01:54:00.864]  They love the mask.
[01:54:01.885 --> 01:54:03.046]  They love their servitude.
[01:54:03.086 --> 01:54:04.067]  They love their slavery.
[01:54:04.307 --> 01:54:08.010]  Because at a psychological level, you have to understand there's a will in people.
[01:54:08.050 --> 01:54:11.573]  There's a will to be free or a will not to be free.
[01:54:13.294 --> 01:54:14.736]  So when you have a will to be free,
[01:54:16.274 --> 01:54:17.435]  You have a spirit of liberty.
[01:54:17.455 --> 01:54:18.656]  You have a spirit of freedom.
[01:54:19.216 --> 01:54:27.142]  When you have the will to control, you're willing to sacrifice anything in order to achieve
[01:54:28.379 --> 01:54:30.200]  That control over your fellow man.
[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:35.003]  So for the low-level street liberal Democrat, the mask is enough for them.
[01:54:35.403 --> 01:54:39.866]  If they can just tell you to wear a mask, they feel fulfilled and that's good for them.
[01:54:40.066 --> 01:54:41.727]  They don't want to own any property.
[01:54:41.848 --> 01:54:43.188]  They don't want to run a small business.
[01:54:43.208 --> 01:54:44.369]  They don't want to have a family.
[01:54:44.389 --> 01:54:45.890]  They don't want to learn for themselves.
[01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:46.951]  They don't want to think for themselves.
[01:54:47.331 --> 01:54:49.132]  They just want to control you and tell you what to do.
[01:54:49.432 --> 01:54:54.976]  So if it's as simple as a tiny little thing like making you wear a mask, that's all they need for the rest of their life.
[01:54:55.816 --> 01:54:56.697]  And that's all they'll have.
[01:54:58.502 --> 01:55:03.044]  We, on the other hand, the freedom-loving individuals, we want a free market.
[01:55:03.104 --> 01:55:04.284]  We want private property.
[01:55:04.324 --> 01:55:05.204]  We want a family.
[01:55:05.264 --> 01:55:06.105]  We want a church.
[01:55:06.405 --> 01:55:07.325]  We want a business.
[01:55:07.525 --> 01:55:08.545]  We want prosperity.
[01:55:09.886 --> 01:55:16.888]  And these are the two diametrically opposed forces right now, and it's all hanging in the balance in the next two months.
[01:55:17.208 --> 01:55:18.689]  And I thank God
[01:55:19.835 --> 01:55:30.765]  I thank God people are finally willing to stand up against this monster, this deep state, this globalism, this global criminal cabal, this global criminal mafia.
[01:55:32.366 --> 01:55:37.471]  I'm so glad Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, the others, more will rise up too.
[01:55:37.651 --> 01:55:38.431]  That's the beauty of it.
[01:55:38.672 --> 01:55:42.935]  When you see something like this, that means, that means the backup forces are coming.
[01:55:45.398 --> 01:55:46.859]  Come and take it!
[01:55:49.124 --> 01:55:49.927]  And they're trying.
[01:55:51.272 --> 01:55:55.587]  They're trying to take it all, but America is rising up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:58.755 --> 01:56:06.940]  The disingenuous, hypocrisy, fraudulent, phony nature of the liberal left has been fully exposed and America is done with it.
[01:56:07.461 --> 01:56:09.582]  Neutral Americans are being kicked into high gear.
[01:56:09.982 --> 01:56:19.448]  The fear that people had to stand up against this deep state, this global criminal cabal, is starting to wane as they realize the entire future is in the balance.
[01:56:21.069 --> 01:56:21.870]  And so I predict
[01:56:25.063 --> 01:56:35.030]  From the leadership of Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Lin Wood, and others, more Americans are going to join this fight, and we are going to be roaring in the next two months.
[01:56:35.890 --> 01:56:37.451]  Roaring our way to victory.
[01:56:37.932 --> 01:56:43.015]  Roaring our way, exposing the deep state election fraud that we've been dealing with in this country for decades.
[01:56:44.616 --> 01:56:51.321]  And then roaring our way to a free market prosperity into the 2020s, unlike anything we've ever seen.
[01:56:52.628 --> 01:56:56.429]  Since maybe the fifties, maybe the original Roaring Twenties, but probably beyond that.
[01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:03.870]  But only can we manifest that destiny if we fight now.
[01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:15.352]  And so that's why I've decided, I mean, I haven't even organized this with anybody, because I was thinking, what's happening in Atlanta is so historic, you know, maybe I just try to fly out there.
[01:57:15.392 --> 01:57:18.553]  I have in-studio duties tomorrow, so it'd be quite a relenting
[01:57:20.287 --> 01:57:20.967]  Travel feat.
[01:57:21.128 --> 01:57:22.188]  But then I decided, you know what?
[01:57:22.288 --> 01:57:23.429]  The people are already in Atlanta.
[01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:24.370]  It's already gonna be massive.
[01:57:24.490 --> 01:57:31.194]  Why don't I mobilize and activate here in Austin again, where for the last two weekends, there have been thousands of people turned up.
[01:57:31.394 --> 01:57:35.437]  So, I'm gonna be back out at the state capitol this Saturday at noon.
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:42.402]  And if you wanna continue to show our support for President Trump here in Texas,
[01:57:44.013 --> 01:57:45.674]  Show up with me this Saturday at noon.
[01:57:45.854 --> 01:57:49.035]  If you want to be a part of the massive rally, head down to Georgia.
[01:57:49.535 --> 01:57:49.935]  Atlanta.
[01:57:50.035 --> 01:57:50.855]  It's gonna be huge.
[01:57:53.156 --> 01:57:56.197]  If you just want to be a part locally, find the state capitol near you.
[01:57:56.737 --> 01:57:58.778]  I'd head that way this Saturday at noon.
[01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:00.639]  There'll probably be other people out there.
[01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:04.840]  And this is the easiest level of fighting this.
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:07.241]  If we have victory at this level, then we are lucky.
[01:58:08.742 --> 01:58:09.422]  We are fortunate.
[01:58:12.108 --> 01:58:17.909]  Because if we can't fight this battle and win in this next two months, folks, the only way out of this is a physical fight.
[01:58:20.269 --> 01:58:22.910]  And none of us want to turn that switch.
[01:58:25.110 --> 01:58:30.091]  None of us want to turn our country into that, what that would look like.
[01:58:34.372 --> 01:58:36.372]  But we're right in the threshold.
[01:58:36.512 --> 01:58:40.033]  I mean, we are in that time period.
[01:58:42.011 --> 01:58:46.776]  And whatever we do here in the next two months determines what we do for the next 10, 20 years.
[01:58:50.639 --> 01:59:01.250]  But this is going to be quite a struggle here, legally for Trump's legal team, and then for we, the American people, to remain steadfast.
[01:59:04.588 --> 01:59:08.931]  And keep our will strong because it's going to be a knockdown, drag-out fight.
[01:59:09.011 --> 01:59:10.953]  And we have the entire media against us.
[01:59:11.093 --> 01:59:12.594]  We have big tech against us.
[01:59:12.794 --> 01:59:13.815]  Hollywood against us.
[01:59:15.436 --> 01:59:17.438]  Most establishment politicians against us.
[01:59:19.039 --> 01:59:19.780]  But we've got us.
[01:59:21.381 --> 01:59:22.041]  We've got Trump.
[01:59:22.882 --> 01:59:24.543]  And we've got more coming to Trump's aid.
[01:59:26.785 --> 01:59:27.385]  So it's on.
[01:59:29.907 --> 01:59:30.228]  It's on.
[01:59:33.658 --> 01:59:35.279]  I need to cover this news here.
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:38.901]  Alex Jones is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[01:59:38.921 --> 01:59:45.944]  I'm going to host the first hour of the War Room with some other breaking news with Harrison Smith and Patrick Howley.
[01:59:47.145 --> 01:59:49.206]  Then Harrison Smith has other great guests after that.
[01:59:51.607 --> 01:59:56.970]  But let me, let me just try to get through all of this news here.
[02:00:01.377 --> 02:00:11.085]  But I've only got five minutes here, so let me just go through some of these other lighter stories before we get to the major stories on the fake pandemic of COVID and then the voter fraud.
[02:00:11.105 --> 02:00:20.812]  But right now, the Great Reset is trending worldwide on Big Tech.
[02:00:22.153 --> 02:00:29.859]  And people are starting to realize what this is, and so now the Mises Institute has a whole essay
[02:00:30.814 --> 02:00:33.656]  The United Nations and the origins of the Great Reset.
[02:00:33.736 --> 02:00:34.576]  And it's all in there.
[02:00:34.656 --> 02:00:35.777]  Fake climate change.
[02:00:36.017 --> 02:00:36.577]  Eugenics.
[02:00:36.798 --> 02:00:37.918]  Population control.
[02:00:37.998 --> 02:00:38.639]  Fake news.
[02:00:39.359 --> 02:00:41.140]  It's all part of the world government.
[02:00:43.862 --> 02:00:45.483]  So how do they bring in the world government?
[02:00:45.643 --> 02:00:46.423]  Using fear.
[02:00:47.444 --> 02:00:51.887]  Using manipulations of trade markets and financial markets.
[02:00:52.567 --> 02:00:53.788]  Bringing them to their knees.
[02:00:54.988 --> 02:00:57.090]  Then you beg for the world government.
[02:00:57.810 --> 02:00:59.031]  Stopping the food chain.
[02:01:00.523 --> 02:01:03.746]  This is the process they're undertaking.
[02:01:03.786 --> 02:01:07.148]  And so that's why America can't shut down again, folks.
[02:01:07.168 --> 02:01:08.589]  That's why they want to shut America down.
[02:01:08.610 --> 02:01:10.311]  And in fact, here's what they're trying to do.
[02:01:13.233 --> 02:01:21.580]  They're going for the third wave of shutdowns and lockdowns because, I mean, folks, the whole COVID thing is over.
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:22.361]  I mean, nobody buys it.
[02:01:22.381 --> 02:01:23.361]  Nobody's really scared of it.
[02:01:23.902 --> 02:01:26.864]  Either you wear the mask for a virtue signal or you hate wearing the mask.
[02:01:27.845 --> 02:01:28.926]  Nobody's really afraid of COVID.
[02:01:28.946 --> 02:01:30.207]  The whole thing's a big joke.
[02:01:31.926 --> 02:01:34.967]  But they're going to have their new, it's just all about TV graphics.
[02:01:35.027 --> 02:01:38.248]  So they'll start seeing the graphics of spikes and cases and all this stuff.
[02:01:38.268 --> 02:01:39.929]  They're always, oh, Texas more cases than ever.
[02:01:39.949 --> 02:01:40.569]  It's all testing.
[02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:41.229]  It's all BS.
[02:01:41.529 --> 02:01:42.329]  The tests don't even work.
[02:01:42.349 --> 02:01:42.870]  They're all fake.
[02:01:46.091 --> 02:01:49.872]  And so what they want to do is they want to have the third lockdown.
[02:01:50.372 --> 02:01:56.694]  They want to have the fake pandemic back on TV, show you the charts, get you scared again, make you wear the mask forever.
[02:01:58.581 --> 02:02:00.743]  And we now have major studies that show the mask doesn't work.
[02:02:00.803 --> 02:02:01.643]  New studies, by the way.
[02:02:01.683 --> 02:02:02.584]  These are brand new studies.
[02:02:02.604 --> 02:02:03.725]  There's dozens of them now.
[02:02:03.865 --> 02:02:04.726]  We'll cover that coming up.
[02:02:06.347 --> 02:02:09.509]  So that you go into the third wave of lockdown.
[02:02:09.730 --> 02:02:10.570]  You're pissed off.
[02:02:10.710 --> 02:02:11.491]  You're sick of it.
[02:02:12.612 --> 02:02:14.753]  You have to be wearing the mask all day.
[02:02:14.893 --> 02:02:16.174]  Now they say in your home.
[02:02:16.335 --> 02:02:17.996]  They now have mask mandates in your home.
[02:02:18.056 --> 02:02:18.716]  I'm not even kidding.
[02:02:18.756 --> 02:02:20.137]  I mean, total tyranny, folks.
[02:02:20.778 --> 02:02:22.059]  Like, somebody comes and does that.
[02:02:22.079 --> 02:02:22.900]  I mean, that's total tyranny.
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:23.700]  What do you do to tyrants?
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:24.561]  Death to tyrants.
[02:02:26.536 --> 02:02:28.417]  Death to tyrants.
[02:02:31.298 --> 02:02:33.079]  Death to tyrants.
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:38.782]  And they want to come make you wear a mask in your home.
[02:02:39.803 --> 02:02:41.203]  So you're going to be so sick of it.
[02:02:41.684 --> 02:02:43.624]  You're going to be struggling financially so much.
[02:02:45.205 --> 02:02:47.166]  But that's when Biden comes to the rescue.
[02:02:47.206 --> 02:02:50.168]  And so they're going to give Biden the big victory right out of it.
[02:02:50.188 --> 02:02:53.189]  It's kind of like how they gave Obama the Nobel Peace Prize when he didn't deserve it.
[02:02:53.549 --> 02:02:54.550]  He was a murderous president.
[02:02:56.124 --> 02:02:56.865]  He ran guns.
[02:03:01.888 --> 02:03:05.530]  They're gonna give Biden the huge victory of, we beat COVID!
[02:03:05.590 --> 02:03:06.291]  And they'll just say it.
[02:03:06.331 --> 02:03:07.432]  It's all TV run anyway.
[02:03:07.592 --> 02:03:10.254]  So the TV will just say, COVID's done, finally!
[02:03:10.574 --> 02:03:11.575]  Thank you, Biden!
[02:03:11.815 --> 02:03:13.336]  You can take off the mask!
[02:03:13.616 --> 02:03:15.177]  You can reopen the business!
[02:03:15.437 --> 02:03:16.618]  We have the vaccine!
[02:03:16.978 --> 02:03:17.859]  Biden did it!
[02:03:18.859 --> 02:03:22.222]  Give him the huge victory, and then shuffle him out,
[02:03:24.304 --> 02:03:30.730]  In a ceremony, and then hand it to Kamala Harris, who was the least popular Democrat during the primaries.
[02:03:31.391 --> 02:03:31.891]  The least.
[02:03:32.092 --> 02:03:33.233]  Polled the lowest.
[02:03:33.413 --> 02:03:37.076]  Nobody likes that disingenuous, fake, phony, dirty cop fraud.
[02:03:42.842 --> 02:03:43.483]  Nobody likes her.
[02:03:45.438 --> 02:03:46.759]  But see, that's the big plan.
[02:03:47.159 --> 02:03:49.661]  Oh, Biden saved us from COVID, but you know what?
[02:03:49.701 --> 02:03:50.582]  He's done his duty.
[02:03:50.622 --> 02:03:51.582]  He's an old man.
[02:03:51.662 --> 02:03:53.223]  He can shuffle off into the sunset.
[02:03:53.504 --> 02:04:02.950]  And then here comes dirty, corrupt Kamala Harris, a dirtbag commie, the fakest laugh, like a wicked witch of the West cackle you've ever seen.
[02:04:03.791 --> 02:04:08.954]  And she's bringing in the communist government quicker than you can even blink an eye.
[02:04:09.014 --> 02:04:10.075]  So that's their plan.
[02:04:10.656 --> 02:04:13.958]  Bring in Biden, saves the world from COVID, totally fake.
[02:04:15.322 --> 02:04:30.183]  He gets celebrated, grandiose ceremony, and then shoehorn in Kamala Harris, the commie dictator witch, to roll you up into a communist global system and sell you out like a slave.
[02:04:32.076 --> 02:04:38.499]  So that's their big plan, and now everyone's aware of it, and that's why everyone's talking about the Great Reset, and that's what COVID was all about.
[02:04:39.119 --> 02:04:40.660]  And that's why they're stealing all these elections.
[02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:43.001]  And now the left knows this is coming, by the way, folks.
[02:04:43.262 --> 02:04:46.863]  See, they are really stupid, but most of it is actually an act.
[02:04:47.183 --> 02:04:48.504]  They know Trump's not racist.
[02:04:48.524 --> 02:04:49.565]  They know Trump won the election.
[02:04:49.585 --> 02:04:53.627]  They're pretending all of that just because they're total frauds, but now they know what's coming.
[02:04:54.187 --> 02:04:55.988]  And so the headline at InfoWars, the story is there.
[02:04:57.099 --> 02:05:04.464]  Leftists suggest re-education camps, firing squads, banning talk radio, and deprogramming 75 million Trump supporters.
[02:05:04.724 --> 02:05:05.944]  Folks, they know they've lost.
[02:05:06.185 --> 02:05:07.045]  They know they're done.
[02:05:07.065 --> 02:05:15.570]  And so this is all they have left, is a total election theft, implant Biden, and then they hope to put us in jail and kill us because they know we're the freedom fighters.
[02:05:15.851 --> 02:05:18.052]  We'll save the world from slavery that they're bringing in.
[02:05:18.432 --> 02:05:19.993]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:20.053 --> 02:05:24.076]  Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex in the Infowars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[02:05:24.156 --> 02:05:25.917]  Alex Jones is joining us in the next hour.
[02:05:28.723 --> 02:05:39.985]  What would you do if you were a global criminal cabal bent on collapsing powerful nation states into a world government that you control?
[02:05:41.206 --> 02:05:51.348]  Well, you would identify the biggest threats to that criminal cabal and the execution of your global criminal plans.
[02:05:53.088 --> 02:05:54.488]  That would be the United States of America.
[02:05:55.389 --> 02:05:56.449]  You would then identify
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:06.202]  Well then what would you do?
[02:06:07.062 --> 02:06:21.985]  You would activate your propaganda agents in the media and in the government and in Hollywood to indoctrinate and brainwash as many subjects as you could to make them your foot soldiers
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:28.023]  Against the freedom fighters that stand in your way of your global criminal enterprise.
[02:06:28.904 --> 02:06:30.045]  So that's what's going on.
[02:06:31.026 --> 02:06:46.397]  And so you're going to see AOC and other leftist liberals call for jailing and reprogramming and yes, killing of Trump supporters in the next two weeks because they've been brainwashed and they have been
[02:06:48.183 --> 02:07:01.258]  Labeled as the New World Order globalist criminal cabal foot soldiers to come in and wipe us out because they realize Info Wars, it's kind of like, well, what would you do?
[02:07:01.278 --> 02:07:02.459]  Well, you'd censor Info Wars.
[02:07:02.479 --> 02:07:04.281]  You'd censor Citizen Zero.
[02:07:04.401 --> 02:07:05.803]  You'd censor Case Zero.
[02:07:06.718 --> 02:07:08.099]  Well, we're case zero.
[02:07:08.139 --> 02:07:10.220]  We're citizen zero for the American Revolution 2.0.
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:17.023]  We're citizen zero for supporting Donald Trump, getting him over the hump of the Republican primary process.
[02:07:17.243 --> 02:07:18.804]  So they targeted us, censored us.
[02:07:19.364 --> 02:07:30.370]  Now they're targeting all the Trump supporters so that they can come in and mop up America, and the brainwashed liberal left dumbasses will have no idea what's going on until they're put in a cage.
[02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:32.651]  But that's how this always goes.
[02:07:33.595 --> 02:07:42.162]  So they activate them as foot soldiers against us, tell them to put us in jail, tell them to kill us, so then when the global criminal cabal comes in, they have no resistance.
[02:07:42.662 --> 02:07:49.548]  We're the resistance, we're the freedom fighters, we are the dam that stands in the way of worldwide tyranny.
[02:07:51.989 --> 02:07:55.792]  And this next two months will determine all of it.
[02:07:58.034 --> 02:08:02.538]  Now let's look at some of the latest headlines
[02:08:04.875 --> 02:08:08.057]  When it comes to the steal that the Democrats are currently engaged in.
[02:08:10.719 --> 02:08:11.540]  The Gateway Pundit.
[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:13.341]  Lin Wood on Mark Levin's show.
[02:08:13.441 --> 02:08:16.324]  Trump won a 70% plus landslide election.
[02:08:16.364 --> 02:08:19.106]  He probably had 400 electoral votes.
[02:08:20.427 --> 02:08:25.170]  Lin Wood usually sells things high, but delivers high.
[02:08:26.211 --> 02:08:28.653]  Like when he sued CNN, I think for like $500 million or something.
[02:08:29.253 --> 02:08:30.694]  I think he ended up getting like $200 million.
[02:08:30.714 --> 02:08:33.897]  So you're like, well, he went high, but $200 million, pretty big.
[02:08:35.219 --> 02:08:36.820]  Will Trump get 400 electoral votes?
[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:37.600]  Probably not.
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:40.001]  Did the Democrats steal California and New York?
[02:08:41.262 --> 02:08:42.983]  Chances are, probably actually.
[02:08:44.524 --> 02:08:46.865]  But no, Trump will get at least 300 electoral votes.
[02:08:50.687 --> 02:08:55.829]  I think, this is a quote from Sidney Powell, I think we'll find that Trump had at least 80 million votes.
[02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:58.691]  Sidney Powell on the magnitude of President Trump's 2020 win.
[02:09:00.336 --> 02:09:11.344]  And then in this story, ladies and gentlemen, The Gateway Pundit has published the returns in these counties at given times, and look at the ratios here.
[02:09:13.473 --> 02:09:20.595]  They come in at a clip of 50.51% for Biden, 49.949% for Trump.
[02:09:21.075 --> 02:09:25.736]  In every time, folks, that is a statistical impossibility.
[02:09:26.056 --> 02:09:32.237]  That's called an algorithm that you put into the electronic voting machines to give the results you want.
[02:09:33.098 --> 02:09:37.659]  We've had Bev Harris on the air about this dozens of times for decades.
[02:09:38.279 --> 02:09:39.359]  Now it's all coming out.
[02:09:41.141 --> 02:09:49.367]  Patrick Halley says this today and he's going to have the story at NationalFile.com and he's going to come on The War Room with me at 3.30 to discuss this.
[02:09:50.387 --> 02:09:50.908]  Busted!
[02:09:51.068 --> 02:10:00.014]  This internal email from Maricopa County, Arizona talks about issues and concerns with markers but says they have to give voters markers anyway instead of ballpoint pens on Election Day.
[02:10:00.354 --> 02:10:02.655]  And we have the email.
[02:10:03.856 --> 02:10:08.499]  And so we're going to talk about that with Patrick Halley on The War Room today and he's going to publish that at NationalFile.com.
[02:10:11.738 --> 02:10:12.378]  The Federalist.
[02:10:12.599 --> 02:10:16.141]  In Nevada, a corrupt cash-for-votes scheme is hiding in plain sight.
[02:10:16.421 --> 02:10:17.542]  And then they even have photos!
[02:10:17.782 --> 02:10:19.964]  Where they pull up and they give people gas cards!
[02:10:20.184 --> 02:10:21.125]  They give people gifts!
[02:10:21.345 --> 02:10:22.726]  And then they stand there with their ballot!
[02:10:22.906 --> 02:10:24.107]  And then they stand there with their gift!
[02:10:24.287 --> 02:10:26.709]  And it all happens, all exchanged, all documented!
[02:10:26.929 --> 02:10:29.731]  Just like what we caught in Texas with Project Veritas!
[02:10:30.031 --> 02:10:32.373]  And it's always Democrats!
[02:10:34.654 --> 02:10:35.435]  Every time!
[02:10:36.376 --> 02:10:38.297]  It's the same psychological analysis.
[02:10:38.857 --> 02:10:39.258]  Why?
[02:10:41.676 --> 02:10:56.581]  Don't Trump supporters, when they organize by the millions in D.C., or hundreds of thousands in Richmond, Virginia, or thousands in Austin, Texas, or Atlanta, or any other state capital, why don't Trump supporters loot, and burn, and assault, and flip cars, and engage in rioting and violence?
[02:10:56.721 --> 02:10:57.602]  Because we don't do it!
[02:10:58.242 --> 02:10:59.122]  It's not in our makeup!
[02:10:59.182 --> 02:11:00.243]  We're not criminal scum!
[02:11:01.043 --> 02:11:04.264]  But, what happens when the Democrats organize like Black Lives Matter?
[02:11:04.464 --> 02:11:06.765]  What happens when the Democrats organize like Antifa?
[02:11:07.438 --> 02:11:12.280]  They assault, they get violent, they riot, they burn, they loot, they steal, they assault people.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.241]  Same thing happens with voter fraud.
[02:11:16.901 --> 02:11:24.524]  Why don't you see the stories and the affidavits and the eyewitness evidence of Republican, where actually you do, but they go for Biden.
[02:11:27.565 --> 02:11:29.426]  But you never see this with Trump people.
[02:11:29.546 --> 02:11:31.927]  Trump people aren't going around mailing in 30 ballots.
[02:11:34.602 --> 02:11:37.684]  Trump people aren't voting under their maiden name and then their married name.
[02:11:37.824 --> 02:11:39.205]  It's always Democrats, every time.
[02:11:39.486 --> 02:11:41.387]  It's the same psychology, folks.
[02:11:41.627 --> 02:11:43.609]  They've already done the massive psychological studies.
[02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:44.530]  We just covered it in Ausium.
[02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:48.493]  Democrats are ten times more likely to steal and rob.
[02:11:48.933 --> 02:11:50.974]  Conservatives are ten times more likely to give to charity.
[02:11:51.435 --> 02:11:52.936]  These are mainline psychological studies.
[02:11:53.116 --> 02:11:54.317]  So, it's the same thing.
[02:11:54.457 --> 02:11:55.958]  Why don't Trump supporters loot and steal?
[02:11:56.298 --> 02:11:56.959]  They're good people.
[02:11:57.219 --> 02:11:58.440]  Why do Democrats loot and steal?
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:11:59.281]  They're bad people.
[02:12:00.265 --> 02:12:01.866]  Why don't Trump supporters cheat to vote?
[02:12:02.067 --> 02:12:02.707]  They're good people.
[02:12:02.967 --> 02:12:04.309]  Why do Democrats cheat to vote?
[02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:05.129]  They're bad people.
[02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:06.030]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:12:06.491 --> 02:12:07.011]  Simple as that.
[02:12:08.533 --> 02:12:10.094]  More statistical anomalies coming.
[02:12:11.115 --> 02:12:11.996]  This is in the New York Times.
[02:12:12.036 --> 02:12:15.699]  They celebrate this right in front of your face, like the Vote Viagra for Biden.
[02:12:19.042 --> 02:12:22.746]  Voters turned out in record numbers in 2020, even during a pandemic.
[02:12:24.946 --> 02:12:27.647]  Both major parties gained millions more votes compared with 2016.
[02:12:28.087 --> 02:12:30.728]  Our analysis found that votes were up in nearly every county.
[02:12:31.048 --> 02:12:32.008]  Actually, that's not true.
[02:12:32.288 --> 02:12:35.749]  It was only in four specific counties that I covered first.
[02:12:35.829 --> 02:12:36.809]  Now everybody's realizing it.
[02:12:38.970 --> 02:12:40.010]  Yeah, it's Detroit.
[02:12:41.011 --> 02:12:42.851]  Yeah, it's Milwaukee.
[02:12:42.991 --> 02:12:43.872]  It's Madison.
[02:12:43.972 --> 02:12:44.712]  It's Philadelphia.
[02:12:44.732 --> 02:12:44.792]  Duh!
[02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:49.071]  But here's the statistical anomalies.
[02:12:49.511 --> 02:12:52.932]  President Trump received 10 million more votes across the U.S.
[02:12:52.992 --> 02:12:56.813]  than he did four years ago, including minority areas.
[02:12:56.853 --> 02:12:59.694]  Wait, so how would President Trump gain 10 million votes?
[02:12:59.734 --> 02:13:01.115]  Well, he gained popularity.
[02:13:01.395 --> 02:13:02.095]  Actually, pretty simple.
[02:13:02.135 --> 02:13:03.216]  We saw it at his rallies.
[02:13:03.536 --> 02:13:04.496]  He continued to deliver.
[02:13:04.856 --> 02:13:08.717]  People realized that all the fake news was lying about him, the Russian collusion, all of it, so they voted for Trump.
[02:13:08.737 --> 02:13:10.038]  But then somehow, magically,
[02:13:11.806 --> 02:13:16.210]  Joe Biden added 12.5 million more votes over Hillary Clinton from years ago.
[02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:17.791]  Well, where's any evidence of that?
[02:13:17.891 --> 02:13:18.732]  How would that happen?
[02:13:18.772 --> 02:13:20.454]  Joe Biden had no rally turnout.
[02:13:21.769 --> 02:13:23.190]  Joe Biden didn't even have rallies.
[02:13:23.730 --> 02:13:26.211]  Joe Biden was completely exposed as a criminal fraud.
[02:13:27.211 --> 02:13:31.493]  So how is it that Biden gets more support than Trump or Hillary?
[02:13:32.533 --> 02:13:38.056]  And how is it that Trump gained support from 2016 even though he lost the election?
[02:13:38.336 --> 02:13:39.876]  Well, folks, the answer's obvious.
[02:13:39.896 --> 02:13:40.416]  We all know it.
[02:13:40.496 --> 02:13:41.517]  The Democrats cheated.
[02:13:42.887 --> 02:13:51.774]  Millions of illegal mail-in votes for Biden, and then millions more votes switched on the electronic voting machines from Trump to Biden.
[02:13:52.054 --> 02:13:53.315]  The Democrats have been caught.
[02:13:53.855 --> 02:13:55.316]  This is massive criminal behavior.
[02:13:55.376 --> 02:13:59.159]  They all need to be locked up in jail, and any Democrat voter ought to be ashamed of themselves.
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:02.721]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:03.782 --> 02:14:05.744]  Owen Schroer here, sitting in for Alex.
[02:14:05.804 --> 02:14:09.987]  We are about to have an all-star panel coming up with Alex Jones.
[02:14:11.411 --> 02:14:18.677]  We'll be featuring Ali Alexander, Nick Fuentes, Jay Dyer and others live coming up here in about 30 minutes.
[02:14:18.737 --> 02:14:20.219]  They may pop in before that as well.
[02:14:21.019 --> 02:14:24.022]  They are on the scene in Atlanta about to have major breaking news.
[02:14:24.923 --> 02:14:33.971]  Folks, again, we skipped about half of our breaks today in the first hour or in the first two hours to cover
[02:14:35.049 --> 02:14:36.849]  That press conference live.
[02:14:37.009 --> 02:14:39.310]  So that was basically us just saying, you know what?
[02:14:39.330 --> 02:14:41.070]  We'll take that financial hit of those breaks.
[02:14:42.131 --> 02:14:45.812]  We trust the audience is going to come through and go to InfoWarsStore.com today.

[02:15:13.521 --> 02:15:25.946]  Now, let me finish up this election stuff and then go into the fake COVID pandemic news that is breaking now as well.
[02:15:29.650 --> 02:15:33.453]  You know, I hear Rudy Giuliani sound more like Trump.
[02:15:33.673 --> 02:15:40.638]  I hear Trump's legal team sound more like Infowars, and it is a... such a relief.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.441]  I really can't even put it into words.
[02:15:46.222 --> 02:15:50.686]  Because I don't really... I don't even know how to explain it.
[02:15:50.746 --> 02:15:50.986]  It's like...
[02:15:52.944 --> 02:16:06.131]  Knowing you know it's like no or like sitting and watching Jeopardy or something and knowing what the answer is and like screaming at the TV what the answer is or Wheel of Fortune or whatever some game show or who wants to be a millionaire and you know the answer and you're sitting there screaming.
[02:16:06.211 --> 02:16:06.931]  Oh, that's the answer.
[02:16:06.971 --> 02:16:10.113]  That's the answer But obviously the TV is not hearing you and then the person gets the answer wrong
[02:16:12.868 --> 02:16:30.956]  I sat here for months, Alex Jones sat here for months and we broke down the oncoming election fraud so much to a tee that the exact counties, the exact counties that we highlighted here at InfoWars are the ones they're investigating right now for massive fraud.
[02:16:31.236 --> 02:16:34.217]  Now, it doesn't take a genius to do this, it takes a little will.
[02:16:35.798 --> 02:16:38.479]  And so, it's shocking to think, wow, we're the only people that have the will?
[02:16:38.859 --> 02:16:39.520]  Not anymore.
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:40.700]  That's the beautiful thing.
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:42.141]  So, it's now coming out.
[02:16:43.888 --> 02:16:52.252]  In the exact two counties, in the exact two counties I highlighted on the war room that they were going to steal in Wisconsin, it's now coming out.
[02:16:53.753 --> 02:17:04.478]  Wisconsin election will recount in two counties to go ahead and it's the two counties that are strong held by Democrats in Milwaukee and Madison.
[02:17:05.139 --> 02:17:05.819]  Duh!
[02:17:06.859 --> 02:17:07.480]  Duh!
[02:17:08.547 --> 02:17:09.127]  Duh!
[02:17:09.227 --> 02:17:11.528]  The Democrats gonna cheat in Philadelphia?
[02:17:11.728 --> 02:17:12.228]  Duh!
[02:17:12.368 --> 02:17:13.488]  It's like Rudy Giuliani.
[02:17:13.508 --> 02:17:14.069]  What did he say?
[02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:20.551]  Democrats cheating in elections in Philadelphia is like getting in a drunken fight at a Philadelphia Eagles game.
[02:17:21.071 --> 02:17:22.671]  It's guaranteed.
[02:17:22.691 --> 02:17:26.752]  It's all coming out.
[02:17:30.033 --> 02:17:32.274]  And I do think it'll go to the Supreme Court, which has me worried.
[02:17:34.343 --> 02:17:35.805]  But that's going for it all, folks.
[02:17:35.965 --> 02:17:37.206]  That's going for the home run.
[02:17:37.226 --> 02:17:38.268]  That's swinging for the fences.
[02:17:38.328 --> 02:17:41.091]  So I admire that from Trump's legal team.
[02:17:41.712 --> 02:17:49.882]  They've obviously weighed the risk, but they realize a small victory outside of the Supreme Court is not going to be impactful enough.
[02:17:51.584 --> 02:17:52.525]  And trust me,
[02:17:55.188 --> 02:18:00.529]  It's not necessarily a bad thing that the Supreme Court is taking these measurements, but they don't have the spine to do it.
[02:18:01.389 --> 02:18:05.110]  It just comes with the territory where they don't want to decide a presidential election.
[02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:06.010]  Okay?
[02:18:07.310 --> 02:18:12.692]  But, they're basically in the position now to decide, they're going to be in the position to decide a presidential election.
[02:18:12.932 --> 02:18:14.092]  A lot of them are going to balk at it.
[02:18:14.772 --> 02:18:19.913]  Unless the evidence is so overwhelming that it's not just this election, but it's the voting machines they're going after.
[02:18:21.377 --> 02:18:23.298]  Then they'd be more willing to make a decision.
[02:18:23.338 --> 02:18:27.781]  But believe me, they're already discussing behind closed doors that they don't want a decision.
[02:18:28.042 --> 02:18:29.282]  They don't want it on their bench.
[02:18:29.322 --> 02:18:30.223]  They don't even want to see it.
[02:18:30.964 --> 02:18:33.325]  But Trump's legal team is like, no, you will see this.
[02:18:34.466 --> 02:18:35.246]  You will rule.
[02:18:35.527 --> 02:18:36.607]  You will see the evidence.
[02:18:36.667 --> 02:18:39.710]  And you will stop these rigged elections from taking place.
[02:18:42.091 --> 02:18:42.872]  That's their pitch.
[02:18:43.332 --> 02:18:44.173]  That's their swing.
[02:18:45.453 --> 02:18:46.134]  That's where we're at.
[02:18:49.673 --> 02:18:51.654]  And it is going to be an epic battle, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:52.615 --> 02:19:08.965]  Now, oddly enough, on a different angle of the last elections, it's going uncovered, you have new, fresh blood into the Republican Party, as highlighted by Gabriela Hoffman here.
[02:19:09.005 --> 02:19:17.530]  There are two new GOP members who grew up under socialism, Cuban-born Carlos Gimenez and Ukrainian-born Victoria Sparts.
[02:19:18.411 --> 02:19:18.571]  So,
[02:19:19.582 --> 02:19:26.163]  They're calling it the anti-communist squad, you know, against the communist squad of AOC and the like.
[02:19:27.204 --> 02:19:38.786]  Two children of Cuman immigrants, Millianakis and Elvira Salazar, descendants of folks who fled socialism, have much to rejoice.
[02:19:38.806 --> 02:19:44.867]  So now we're going to have the anti-communist squad of all these young Republicans in there, who by the way, folks, it's incredible, I looked at it.
[02:19:45.487 --> 02:19:48.508]  Most of the new Democrats elected to Congress are white men.
[02:19:50.009 --> 02:19:55.096]  Most the new Republicans elected to Congress are women or black and Latino men.
[02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:02.846]  Now, one of the freshly elected Democrats who, my guess is, got in with a cheat in St.
[02:20:02.886 --> 02:20:03.126]  Louis.
[02:20:04.428 --> 02:20:05.649]  Because I talk to people in St.
[02:20:05.689 --> 02:20:06.950]  Louis, nobody likes this.
[02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:11.192]  And they know she's an Antifa, Black Lives Matter goon, Cori Bush.
[02:20:11.953 --> 02:20:15.135]  But she's already going full bore with her communist tactics.
[02:20:15.635 --> 02:20:23.220]  And she says, we want to cancel student debt and medical debt because we believe education and healthcare are human rights.
[02:20:25.622 --> 02:20:26.962]  Very complex stuff there.
[02:20:27.543 --> 02:20:28.283]  Real issues.
[02:20:29.344 --> 02:20:31.005]  But here's what they've already said they want to do.
[02:20:31.045 --> 02:20:33.507]  They only want to relieve medical debt and student debt.
[02:20:34.224 --> 02:20:42.049]  For African American or Latino American Americans who happen to be in debt.
[02:20:42.229 --> 02:20:46.892]  And my guess is they'll strike Latino out of that too and probably just end up giving it to black Americans.
[02:20:47.913 --> 02:20:53.676]  Because they're already making statements and putting it into I guess whatever you want to call it.
[02:20:55.177 --> 02:21:00.761]  Where they no longer consider Asian Americans to be minorities.
[02:21:01.946 --> 02:21:07.009]  Or they'll say, oh, these are not oppressed groups, and then they'll say, oh, only black Americans are oppressed groups.
[02:21:07.549 --> 02:21:21.678]  To fully... really try to empower Black Lives Matter, and to fully indoctrinate these black people into thinking that, okay, you run America now because you're black, and so whatever you say goes because you're black.
[02:21:22.879 --> 02:21:24.780]  And that's what they get these people to believe.
[02:21:27.076 --> 02:21:34.182]  And so, that's what people like Cori Bush and the Democrats are about to bring to this next Congress.
[02:21:34.202 --> 02:21:36.384]  I think it'll be the 117th Congress, guys?
[02:21:37.145 --> 02:21:37.685]  Check me on that.
[02:21:37.905 --> 02:21:45.352]  I think that the Congress that'll be sworn in on January 21st, I believe is what it is, or somewhere in January, will be the 117th Congress.
[02:21:45.372 --> 02:21:48.234]  So, that's all coming up.
[02:21:51.777 --> 02:21:52.098]  Also,
[02:21:53.556 --> 02:21:58.701]  Another tech giant is leaving Silicon Valley.
[02:21:58.861 --> 02:22:04.326]  Keith Raybois is leaving Silicon Valley.
[02:22:04.366 --> 02:22:06.708]  He's been involved with Square, LinkedIn, Yelp, PayPal.
[02:22:07.169 --> 02:22:10.492]  He says he's moving from Silicon Valley.
[02:22:10.772 --> 02:22:18.139]  Quote, I think San Francisco is just so massively improperly run and managed that it's impossible to stay here.
[02:22:20.387 --> 02:22:21.127]  He knows as well.
[02:22:21.207 --> 02:22:23.028]  COVID sort of masks this stuff.
[02:22:23.068 --> 02:22:29.111]  It's not quite as obvious where people are moving to and if they've actually moved since everybody's working remotely.
[02:22:29.191 --> 02:22:32.633]  So, basically, the Democrats have destroyed California.
[02:22:32.693 --> 02:22:35.354]  The Democrats have destroyed the great cities of California.
[02:22:35.974 --> 02:22:43.618]  Anybody with any wherewithal who wants to live in a actual functioning free society has realized that and is moving the hell out of California.
[02:22:43.858 --> 02:22:54.284]  In fact, you now have Californians signing and forming petitions to secede from California and start now, they call it the Greater Idaho, and they're linking up with people in Oregon.
[02:22:54.804 --> 02:23:16.540]  So, basically saying, alright, we'll give the Democrats, and the commie Democrats, Portland to destroy, Seattle to destroy, San Francisco to destroy, Los Angeles to destroy, Oakland to destroy, they've already destroyed all of it, but they're saying, here Democrats, you keep your hellholes, you keep your crap pits of San Francisco and Portland and the rest, we're just going to secede and join the greater Idaho.
[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:17.580]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:18.061]  The point is,
[02:23:19.022 --> 02:23:22.607]  Democrats have destroyed every major city they run.
[02:23:23.148 --> 02:23:24.050]  Everybody knows it.
[02:23:24.350 --> 02:23:25.532]  And they're moving the hell out.
[02:23:25.792 --> 02:23:27.335]  And it's happening right now in California.
[02:23:27.655 --> 02:23:29.458]  Alex Jones and an all-star cast coming up.
[02:23:29.478 --> 02:23:30.039]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:23:30.543 --> 02:23:33.684]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[02:23:34.004 --> 02:23:34.785]  Don't let them win.
[02:23:35.185 --> 02:23:39.967]  Go to our Emergency Election Newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:23:40.227 --> 02:23:43.789]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[02:23:44.109 --> 02:23:46.410]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:23:46.610 --> 02:23:49.051]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[02:23:50.163 --> 02:23:55.146]  All right, for the next hour and 10 minutes, we're taking over from Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:23:55.246 --> 02:23:59.028]  Owen Schroer riding shotgun in the Austin, Texas Command Center.
[02:23:59.508 --> 02:24:11.174]  And we've got Jay Dyer, we've got Nick Fuentes, we've got Ali Alexander all sitting to my right here from this hotel office area here in downtown Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:24:11.214 --> 02:24:11.815]  We're going to
[02:24:12.455 --> 02:24:18.737]  Leave here about an hour and 15 minutes and drive to the governor's mansion about 10 minutes away for a protest there.
[02:24:19.577 --> 02:24:21.378]  We had even bigger crowd out today.
[02:24:21.418 --> 02:24:22.038]  Amazing folks.
[02:24:22.078 --> 02:24:22.738]  Thank you for coming out.
[02:24:22.858 --> 02:24:24.739]  I'll be out tomorrow at high noon.
[02:24:25.499 --> 02:24:26.159]  They're at the Capitol.
[02:24:26.459 --> 02:24:27.120]  I wasn't there today.
[02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:34.782]  I was holding on the floor here in a bunch of time, but Ali Alexander and the rest of these other great patriots who are again, they don't work for him for people think is there on the show.
[02:24:34.802 --> 02:24:35.902]  They must work from fours are with us.
[02:24:36.222 --> 02:24:40.644]  No, they're just other great patrons that we've coordinated with like all the other citizens that are here.
[02:24:41.084 --> 02:24:56.272]  I promise you today that they had the press conference that I was going to talk about the way to stop the great lockdown, the great reset, the great end of civilization, the great corporate economic siege weapon and lay out how to do it.
[02:24:57.132 --> 02:24:58.173]  I'll do that tomorrow.
[02:24:59.173 --> 02:25:04.576]  In fact, I think today I'll just take probably 30 minutes where I really get down to brass tacks and lay it out because it's really scientific.
[02:25:04.616 --> 02:25:06.097]  It's also historical and it's a way to defeat it.
[02:25:06.137 --> 02:25:07.498]  But bottom line, you've got to start
[02:25:08.632 --> 02:25:21.803]  Talking about how this is a crime against humanity, Nuremberg trial, Geneva Convention violation, how it is organized crime, and how they are the ones behind it, and how diabolical it is to create a world of oppression and consolidate control in their own words.
[02:25:22.584 --> 02:25:24.545]  And so that's all coming up.
[02:25:24.625 --> 02:25:34.914]  But let's start with Jay Dyer, because Jay, in the next hour, we're going to hit in great detail this big press conference by Trump's lawyers that I had a chance to watch, you guys were downtown.
[02:25:35.514 --> 02:25:37.135]  We basically carried that the first two hours.
[02:25:38.277 --> 02:25:39.278]  You guys were at the Capitol.
[02:25:40.158 --> 02:25:41.299]  You were getting a lot of tweets, though.
[02:25:41.319 --> 02:25:42.840]  People were saying 9 out of 10 stars.
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:47.043]  Pretty powerful evidence being put on the media, trying to cover that up.
[02:25:47.083 --> 02:25:47.903]  That's next hour.
[02:25:48.364 --> 02:25:52.967]  But right now, this little segment and a little extra segment coming up, and then most of the next hour, we'll get to the other subject.
[02:25:53.727 --> 02:25:54.928]  What is the Great Reset?
[02:25:55.008 --> 02:25:56.269]  Why is it such a big deal?
[02:25:56.329 --> 02:26:02.453]  And how do we resist it and energize humanity to understand this is 21st century warfare, Jay Dyer?
[02:26:03.513 --> 02:26:06.335]  This is an at least 100 year old technocratic plan.
[02:26:06.375 --> 02:26:07.997]  You've got people like HG Wells.
[02:26:08.017 --> 02:26:09.999]  You've got people like Bertrand Russell.
[02:26:10.019 --> 02:26:20.528]  They said 100 plus years ago that what they would bring in eventually was a plan to integrate every continent, every nation into a global government under a technocratic bureaucracy.
[02:26:20.648 --> 02:26:21.168]  Unelected.
[02:26:21.188 --> 02:26:22.829]  You don't have any say so in it.
[02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:26.152]  And so this plan has continuity and it's global.
[02:26:26.212 --> 02:26:27.794]  It's not located in one place.
[02:26:28.434 --> 02:26:34.601]  And now we know from 2018, it's explicitly through the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Klaus Schwab's book, he lays it all out.
[02:26:34.742 --> 02:26:38.186]  He says at the beginning of the book that we're going to inculcate a new ethic.
[02:26:38.446 --> 02:26:40.909]  He calls it a new covenant using religious language.
[02:26:41.089 --> 02:26:44.433]  It's a new covenant that will brainwash the youth, mainly.
[02:26:44.953 --> 02:26:51.656]  So then when they come into, you know, their flourishing period, they're going to accept this and it includes every aspect of society.
[02:26:51.836 --> 02:26:52.777]  It's a rewrite.
[02:26:53.177 --> 02:26:54.758]  It's a synthetic rewrite of biology.
[02:26:55.218 --> 02:26:58.899]  It's a integration of all the economies into one global economy.
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:00.900]  It's a cashless society.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.281]  It's a track and trace society.
[02:27:02.381 --> 02:27:04.962]  And Klaus even goes to the point of mentioning microchips.
[02:27:05.002 --> 02:27:06.643]  He says everybody's going to take a microchip.
[02:27:06.863 --> 02:27:08.784]  It's going to be integrated into a satellite network.
[02:27:09.324 --> 02:27:10.365]  That's what the Greek says.
[02:27:10.385 --> 02:27:15.210]  He said we're going to merge humans with machines, and now the British Prime Minister is saying that.
[02:27:15.811 --> 02:27:26.622]  Yeah, Trudeau says this is the opportunity right now we've been looking for, that's why Klaus wrote his book 2018, and then he writes another book saying this is the excuse, now bring it in.
[02:27:26.682 --> 02:27:28.865]  And he says COVID isn't even a threat, we're using it for that.
[02:27:29.025 --> 02:27:30.687]  Why are they being honest about it?
[02:27:31.736 --> 02:27:32.337]  Absolutely.
[02:27:32.357 --> 02:27:33.678]  Nick Fuentes, you've been laying this out.
[02:27:33.718 --> 02:27:35.459]  What's your perspective on how we stop it?
[02:27:50.561 --> 02:27:54.025]  Well, I think that this is basically the last stand here.
[02:27:54.126 --> 02:27:56.048]  I think that what Jay is saying is true.
[02:27:56.128 --> 02:28:00.994]  And if you read the book that Klaus Schwab wrote about COVID, this is the excuse that they're using.
[02:28:01.174 --> 02:28:02.516]  And this is the pretext.
[02:28:03.016 --> 02:28:05.760]  This is the transition when they're going to make their move here.
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:09.965]  So the way that we have to stop it is there needs to be a unity among everybody.
[02:28:10.645 --> 02:28:12.447]  That is basically pro-humanity.
[02:28:12.847 --> 02:28:15.609]  This isn't even really in some sense a right-wing thing.
[02:28:15.969 --> 02:28:25.757]  It's really more about defending our biological, spiritual, and cultural integrity as the people against, you could say, transhumanism, globalism, whatever you want to call it.
[02:28:26.157 --> 02:28:30.901]  And I really do believe that's what President Trump did in a more implicit way in 2016.
[02:28:31.021 --> 02:28:33.263]  It was a lot of Obama voters.
[02:28:33.983 --> 02:28:34.783]  It went for Trump in 2016.
[02:28:34.903 --> 02:28:39.244]  And Trump was announcing it's about you, the people, a human world, a world for humans.
[02:28:39.264 --> 02:28:40.645]  He was directly challenging it.
[02:28:41.125 --> 02:28:41.605]  Exactly.
[02:28:41.665 --> 02:28:48.606]  It wasn't the typical Beltway conservatism articulated by people like William F. Buckley or even Ronald Reagan or something like that.
[02:28:48.946 --> 02:28:59.629]  It was something, I think, that was a little bit more with a universal appeal, a universal call, and a cry out against what I think everybody's been witnessing happening, which is a society that is not human.
[02:29:00.934 --> 02:29:03.017]  Total homogenization of the entire planet.
[02:29:03.037 --> 02:29:05.521]  The destruction of culture, the destruction of humanity.
[02:29:06.162 --> 02:29:07.444]  It is really an alien takeover.
[02:29:07.484 --> 02:29:09.046]  Whatever's behind it, it's anti-human.
[02:29:09.106 --> 02:29:10.728]  Ollie Alexander, you want to comment on this?
[02:29:11.499 --> 02:29:18.162]  Yeah, I think that the reason I think all of us are participating in Stop the Peel isn't just for Stop the Peel.
[02:29:18.242 --> 02:29:19.423]  It's not for Trump.
[02:29:19.483 --> 02:29:20.783]  It's not about this election.
[02:29:21.123 --> 02:29:26.606]  It's that they've been dogging us for six months, seven months, eight months, and they're trying to break the human spirit.
[02:29:26.966 --> 02:29:30.828]  So, you know, if I were to answer the question that you asked Nick, it was, well, how do we win?
[02:29:31.568 --> 02:29:32.890]  We build the morale.
[02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:39.218]  We build this strange alliance between pro-human people and say, we're not going to cooperate with your lockdowns.
[02:29:39.459 --> 02:29:41.581]  We don't believe your stupid media.
[02:29:41.842 --> 02:29:43.905]  We're not going to take your stupid vaccine.
[02:29:43.925 --> 02:29:46.989]  We are going to survive like we've survived as a species.
[02:29:48.971 --> 02:29:50.193]  We believe in self-governance.
[02:29:50.413 --> 02:29:52.776]  And I just, I'm not going to do anything else.
[02:29:53.096 --> 02:29:56.921]  So stop the steal, lockdowns, prevent the great reset.
[02:29:57.682 --> 02:30:00.246]  What we need is actually a reset in the social contract.
[02:30:00.606 --> 02:30:02.468]  And that's what we're, I think, all pushing for.
[02:30:04.531 --> 02:30:16.254]  The IMF, the World Bank, the big central banks are the most ruthless people that go in and try to bankrupt third world countries, try to dehumanize people, try to get people in debt, and now they're trying to destroy the economy to put us in debt, calling that helping the poor.
[02:30:16.294 --> 02:30:25.616]  It is the most cynical, sickening evil by Klaus Schwab and Justin Trudeau and all of them, and the weird New Age cult-like heaven's
[02:30:26.076 --> 02:30:27.477]  We're good to go.
[02:30:45.006 --> 02:30:46.708]  It only gets better by resisting.
[02:30:47.089 --> 02:30:57.482]  And they want to bankrupt things to make you poor so they can give you a universal income at a subsistence level to dictate the terms of your surrender, which means the destruction of you and your family.
[02:30:58.271 --> 02:31:00.572]  Yeah, and it's the terms of your survival.
[02:31:00.932 --> 02:31:03.993]  You know, if you don't take the UBI, you don't eat.
[02:31:04.313 --> 02:31:07.654]  You can't take the train, you can't take a plane, you can't send your kids to college.
[02:31:07.994 --> 02:31:10.495]  It's not just this peer pressure, this psychological thing.
[02:31:10.896 --> 02:31:13.016]  They want to kill you if you don't take the mark.
[02:31:13.036 --> 02:31:14.877]  And they're going to sell it to you as enlightenment.
[02:31:15.137 --> 02:31:19.862]  You want to see what Big Tech does with just the proto version of this, Jay?
[02:31:20.383 --> 02:31:26.749]  It's all about control, all about intimidation, all about social credit score, all about censorship, all about starving you.
[02:31:26.769 --> 02:31:28.131]  This is just the first wave.
[02:31:29.292 --> 02:31:34.037]  We had Facebook rolled out to us ultimately as the beginning stages of this.
[02:31:34.157 --> 02:31:37.741]  Social media was the preparation for the social credit system.
[02:31:38.281 --> 02:31:41.323]  So the same people that do that, they roll it out in China.
[02:31:41.704 --> 02:31:42.244]  It's the same.
[02:31:42.324 --> 02:31:44.526]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:31:45.286 --> 02:31:48.389]  And so what that's going to be is, again, this integrated system.
[02:31:48.589 --> 02:31:58.656]  And if you go all the way back to Plato, go back to the ancient world, Plato said control the lower part of the pyramid by making it communal, making sure they don't have private property.
[02:31:58.716 --> 02:32:00.157]  Klaus says you're not going to own anything.
[02:32:00.177 --> 02:32:00.878]  You're going to be happy.
[02:32:01.398 --> 02:32:02.159]  You will be happy.
[02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:05.283]  He's sitting there in his Blofeld outfit, literally looking like Blofeld.
[02:32:05.383 --> 02:32:08.367]  He wears the actual costume of Hollywood people, right?
[02:32:08.667 --> 02:32:10.410]  And he's sitting up there saying, you will be happy.
[02:32:10.430 --> 02:32:11.471]  You're not going to own anything.
[02:32:11.491 --> 02:32:14.395]  You're going to have a circular economy where you rent everything.
[02:32:14.735 --> 02:32:16.157]  You'll rent everything from Jeff Bezos.
[02:32:16.923 --> 02:32:18.464]  And that's what Nick Rockefeller famously told
[02:32:38.294 --> 02:32:40.555]  Aaron Russo, before he died, is that that was the plan?
[02:32:41.256 --> 02:32:41.456]  Right.
[02:32:41.676 --> 02:32:42.437]  Yeah.
[02:32:42.657 --> 02:32:43.697]  Feminism plays into that.
[02:32:43.797 --> 02:32:48.720]  He said that to get the women into the workforce, and then there's a whole other bundle of people to tax, right?
[02:32:49.041 --> 02:32:51.082]  Then also, in the long run, destroys the family.
[02:32:51.102 --> 02:33:03.870]  You have that Berelson memo, the Planned Parenthood memo from the late 60s, 68, 69, where they state that, the Jaffe memo, that they will bring all of this in as a social plan, ultimately to get rid of the family.
[02:33:04.878 --> 02:33:05.298]  That's the goal.
[02:33:05.318 --> 02:33:09.642]  And then when they said we're going to have a global government using the threat of a virus and the Rockefeller plans and all of it.
[02:33:10.083 --> 02:33:10.263]  Yeah.
[02:33:11.003 --> 02:33:11.444]  Nick?
[02:33:12.144 --> 02:33:15.988]  Well, and I think what people have to realize when you ask about what we could do to stop this.
[02:33:16.701 --> 02:33:24.564]  In my opinion, one of the biggest things that's keeping people from getting out on the streets and taking action is the fear of repercussions of opposing the system.
[02:33:24.984 --> 02:33:32.227]  And what people have to begin to realize is that if we lose this battle and if this transition is allowed to take place, that's it.
[02:33:32.607 --> 02:33:33.287]  That's the end.
[02:33:33.587 --> 02:33:35.328]  There is nothing worse than what's coming.
[02:33:35.368 --> 02:33:36.188]  When they talk about
[02:33:36.875 --> 02:33:41.521]  No private property, circular economy, mass surveillance, that's another aspect.
[02:33:41.922 --> 02:33:51.194]  In the article that we're all talking about, I think from 2016, at the closing part of the article, it's very interesting, there's sort of some foreshadowing in the end, they say...
[02:33:51.915 --> 02:33:53.797]  Well, the elites have all my information.
[02:33:53.857 --> 02:33:55.118]  They know everything about me.
[02:33:55.498 --> 02:33:57.240]  I hope that no one will use that against me.
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:33:59.201]  And it's sort of like... Very threatening.
[02:33:59.622 --> 02:34:00.122]  Exactly.
[02:34:00.202 --> 02:34:00.923]  Exactly right.
[02:34:01.223 --> 02:34:05.006]  The implicit threat that at any moment in time we can be crushed by the elites.
[02:34:05.346 --> 02:34:06.147]  The point is this.
[02:34:06.668 --> 02:34:10.070]  The repercussions now are... Maybe you lose your job.
[02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:11.291]  Maybe you get called racist.
[02:34:11.311 --> 02:34:12.793]  You get called some kind of... Stay there.
[02:34:12.813 --> 02:34:14.414]  Tell us what the future repercussions are.
[02:34:14.734 --> 02:34:16.516]  Submitting now will destroy you forever.
[02:34:16.836 --> 02:34:18.778]  Hour number four with all of our great guests.
[02:34:18.858 --> 02:34:19.538]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:34:19.558 --> 02:34:19.939]  Stay with us.
[02:34:21.783 --> 02:34:23.364]  I want to be very, very clear with listeners.
[02:34:23.744 --> 02:34:29.006]  We, as those that are informed and understand what's happening, need to go out and warn everybody.
[02:34:29.586 --> 02:34:38.390]  So getting back to what you were saying, Nick Fuentes, about what's coming next, what they've taken now, the social credit score, what comes next once they get full power and control.
[02:34:38.410 --> 02:34:41.071]  I want to get Jay Dyer and Ali Alexander's take on it.
[02:34:42.779 --> 02:34:43.279]  Yeah, go for it.
[02:34:43.319 --> 02:34:44.039]  Oh, you want me first?
[02:34:44.099 --> 02:34:45.540]  No, no, you were saying what's coming next.
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:47.020]  That's right, yeah.
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:49.821]  Well, what's coming next is far worse than what's happening right now.
[02:34:49.901 --> 02:34:50.541]  That's the point.
[02:34:51.002 --> 02:34:52.782]  People are afraid to speak out right now.
[02:34:52.882 --> 02:34:54.142]  People are afraid to stand up.
[02:34:54.543 --> 02:34:59.644]  And each day is only going to be worse than the previous day as far as consequences go.
[02:35:00.284 --> 02:35:02.045]  20 years ago was easier than 10 years ago.
[02:35:02.065 --> 02:35:03.565]  10 years ago, easier than today.
[02:35:03.965 --> 02:35:05.366]  And people have to start to consider...
[02:35:06.135 --> 02:35:11.000]  That each day into the future, it will become more difficult to challenge this afterwards.
[02:35:11.321 --> 02:35:13.263]  And look what's happening right now with big tech.
[02:35:13.663 --> 02:35:18.308]  It wasn't nearly as bad on big tech as far as censorship goes, even just four years ago.
[02:35:18.448 --> 02:35:22.272]  I remember a time when there were three people, you could name them on one hand.
[02:35:22.933 --> 02:35:23.273]  We're good to go.
[02:35:44.591 --> 02:35:45.852]  You can't have a Facebook account.
[02:35:45.932 --> 02:35:53.075]  And people that are afraid of standing up now must realize that this trend will not reverse unless we begin to resist.
[02:35:53.415 --> 02:35:55.035]  There is no natural pushback.
[02:35:55.056 --> 02:35:56.336]  There is nothing that we can expect.
[02:35:56.376 --> 02:35:57.497]  We've created a vacuum.
[02:35:58.377 --> 02:35:58.817]  Exactly.
[02:35:58.957 --> 02:35:59.597]  Exactly right.
[02:35:59.637 --> 02:36:00.858]  So it's terrible.
[02:36:01.118 --> 02:36:02.519]  And people have to start rising up.
[02:36:02.559 --> 02:36:03.059]  I think this
[02:36:04.006 --> 02:36:09.111]  In the sense that the president winning outright this election might have been the best outcome.
[02:36:09.391 --> 02:36:12.434]  I think the next best outcome is what's happening right now.
[02:36:12.554 --> 02:36:18.219]  Because the widespread fraud is galvanizing people finally to take action when they hadn't been doing so before.
[02:36:19.693 --> 02:36:27.701]  Yeah, I think the next phase we saw in the last year, an attack on the economy.
[02:36:27.781 --> 02:36:36.489]  I think a lot of people are overlooking the fact that this is about the consolidation, removal of cash, consolidation of middle class wealth, transferring it to the big box stores, the elite.
[02:36:36.549 --> 02:36:38.131]  That was a big part of COVID.
[02:36:39.011 --> 02:36:41.412]  And what's next is the next phase of that.
[02:36:41.492 --> 02:36:44.314]  I literally think that what they want to do is tank the economy.
[02:36:45.034 --> 02:36:51.277]  And when they do that, everybody's going to be begging for the salvation that will come from, oh, grant me the UBI.
[02:36:51.317 --> 02:36:53.459]  Grant me this, you know, capitalism of the world.
[02:36:53.479 --> 02:36:54.279]  Oh, they say that's the plan.
[02:36:54.299 --> 02:36:56.720]  We're going to bankrupt the old system to fix it.
[02:36:56.780 --> 02:36:59.922]  Everybody gets things free, but it's really consolidation of wealth and making us poor.
[02:37:00.242 --> 02:37:01.203]  This is what they do.
[02:37:01.263 --> 02:37:03.084]  They will bring the problems.
[02:37:03.184 --> 02:37:05.666]  They'll blame everyone else for the problems that they bring.
[02:37:05.766 --> 02:37:07.608]  And then they'll say, oh, by the way, we have a fix for this.
[02:37:08.028 --> 02:37:11.071]  And our fix, by the way, is worse than what you had before.
[02:37:11.191 --> 02:37:16.455]  So it's intentionally destroying the existing system, popping it basically.
[02:37:16.835 --> 02:37:17.556]  Big debt bubble.
[02:37:17.696 --> 02:37:18.937]  I think they're eventually going to pop that.
[02:37:19.097 --> 02:37:19.417]  That's right.
[02:37:19.437 --> 02:37:25.902]  They're popping the bubble they created and then blaming it on COVID and then using the bubble collapse to give them the creative more power.
[02:37:26.303 --> 02:37:26.723]  Exactly.
[02:37:27.441 --> 02:37:28.723]  Yeah, I mean, just think about this.
[02:37:28.803 --> 02:37:32.889]  When we normalized China, and that was a Republican problem with Nixon and Kissinger.
[02:37:33.369 --> 02:37:40.940]  When we normalized China for their products and their manufacturing, you might have said, well, there was pent-up American demand and it may have made sense.
[02:37:41.661 --> 02:37:42.522]  But stealth...
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:44.480]  We're good to go.
[02:38:04.245 --> 02:38:05.526]  It's a real sickening problem.
[02:38:05.546 --> 02:38:06.787]  I think everybody's waking up.
[02:38:07.128 --> 02:38:16.336]  What's inspiring to me, though, you know, Nick talked about this at our rally outside the Georgia State Capitol today, was that, you know, if you look at it, we should be losing.
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:22.965]  But somehow God is waking up patriots, God-fearing people, and saying, stand up and resist.
[02:38:23.025 --> 02:38:26.747]  And I think everyone's resisting and coalescing around this central planning.
[02:38:26.787 --> 02:38:28.008]  They're bad central planners.
[02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:29.569]  They mean to kill the poor.
[02:38:29.850 --> 02:38:31.071]  They mean to kill the sick.
[02:38:31.271 --> 02:38:33.232]  And then they mean to rule over the rest of us.
[02:38:33.632 --> 02:38:35.894]  And I think that, you know, I'm just not going to go into that world.
[02:38:35.914 --> 02:38:37.595]  And I think that's where everybody else is too.
[02:38:37.615 --> 02:38:38.096]  Exactly.
[02:38:38.116 --> 02:38:45.842]  We're going to go to 60-second break and come back and get into the big picture and then focus back in on the election, which is all a microcosm of this globalist takeover.
[02:38:47.136 --> 02:38:48.857]  They are bad planners on purpose.
[02:38:48.877 --> 02:38:50.017]  They want us out of the way.
[02:38:50.057 --> 02:38:52.018]  They got power because they want to wipe us out.
[02:38:52.438 --> 02:38:54.839]  They believe in a post-industrial, post-human future.
[02:38:55.399 --> 02:38:58.941]  And so, it's just going to get worse from here on out until we finally push back.
[02:38:59.241 --> 02:38:59.921]  We'll be right back.
[02:38:59.961 --> 02:39:03.382]  On the other side, Infowars.com and Newswars.com are the sites.
[02:39:03.883 --> 02:39:06.204]  Pan.Video, you're sharing those links, folks.
[02:39:06.304 --> 02:39:07.284]  Record traffic to the sites.
[02:39:07.664 --> 02:39:08.585]  Big Tech is pissed.
[02:39:08.645 --> 02:39:09.825]  This is the revolution.
[02:39:10.105 --> 02:39:10.605]  Thanks to you.
[02:39:10.725 --> 02:39:11.526]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[02:39:11.546 --> 02:39:12.026]  We'll be right back.
[02:39:13.829 --> 02:39:14.309]  All right, folks.
[02:39:14.369 --> 02:39:15.450]  It's hour number four.
[02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:18.092]  Owen Schroer's done an incredible job the last three hours.
[02:39:18.612 --> 02:39:19.873]  He's going to punch out here.
[02:39:19.893 --> 02:39:21.514]  I'm coming to you live from Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:39:21.534 --> 02:39:22.534]  He's in Austin, Texas.
[02:39:22.935 --> 02:39:26.417]  He'll be hosting the War Room coming up in about 55 minutes for three hours.
[02:39:26.817 --> 02:39:27.898]  So be sure to tune into that.
[02:39:27.978 --> 02:39:30.299]  He'll have all the highlights of the incredible press conference today.
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:33.982]  But I wanted to get your take, because you got a chance to watch it all.
[02:39:34.522 --> 02:39:35.583]  I got a chance to see the first.
[02:39:36.323 --> 02:39:43.786]  Well, Alex, I think as far as what we wanted to see in here, it pretty much was a full delivery outside of just having these victories in courts, which will just have to, you know, be patient, wait for the process to play out.
[02:39:43.806 --> 02:39:44.146]  But.
[02:40:05.968 --> 02:40:22.171]  Hearing and seeing Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis step up to the plate, have this historical two-hour press conference, and say everything that we've been saying for the longest time to try to expose our rigged elections has been such a relief, Alex.
[02:40:22.211 --> 02:40:28.513]  I had so many people that reach out to me yesterday saying, oh and you're on edge, you sound frustrated, you know, you're cantankerous, what's going on?
[02:40:28.533 --> 02:40:31.613]  I'm saying, hey man, they're stealing our election, I'm in the arena, nobody's coming to fight!
[02:40:31.913 --> 02:40:34.474]  But then you had that meteoric
[02:40:35.370 --> 02:40:40.033]  A crash landing into our political system today with that press conference.
[02:40:40.533 --> 02:40:49.879]  And I mean, my goodness, I mean, I'm just afraid of what's going to happen with the left just embracing this fake presidential election of Joe Biden and dancing and slobbering all over themselves over it.
[02:40:49.899 --> 02:40:51.179]  And then it's all taken away from him.
[02:40:51.279 --> 02:40:52.440]  Owen Schroer, amazing job.
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:54.261]  Forum coming up 3pm at 4s.com.
[02:40:54.281 --> 02:40:57.003]  We've also got Ali Alexander here on his own amazing Twitter.
[02:40:57.243 --> 02:40:58.884]  We had hundreds of thousands watching last night.
[02:40:59.204 --> 02:41:01.005]  When he was streaming, it was great to be there with you.
[02:41:01.265 --> 02:41:04.427]  We're here in Georgia, here in Atlanta, Georgia, with Stop the Steal.
[02:41:04.667 --> 02:41:10.411]  We've had big victories in places like Michigan, big things happening up in Pennsylvania.
[02:41:10.451 --> 02:41:20.017]  We have this big press conference with Giuliani, where most folks are saying 9 out of 10 stars, delivered massive proof, affidavits, witnesses of systemic fraud, the same fraud nationwide.
[02:41:20.337 --> 02:41:22.118]  We've got Jay Dyer here.
[02:41:22.378 --> 02:41:23.679]  We've also got Nick Fuentes.
[02:41:24.199 --> 02:41:25.300]  No one needs any introduction.
[02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:31.202]  Let's just go down the line with your take on where this fight is and the feedback you've gotten, J. Dyer.
[02:41:31.382 --> 02:41:33.723]  I think we're going to see a lot of victory here.
[02:41:33.824 --> 02:41:39.706]  I think we're seeing people wake up to the fact that we have been lied to consistently for a long time by the media.
[02:41:39.746 --> 02:41:45.189]  We were told for the last four years that Russia stole the election, they hacked the election, they gave it to Donald Trump.
[02:41:45.509 --> 02:41:48.870]  It all collapsed, actually like ten times in the last four years it collapsed.
[02:41:48.911 --> 02:41:49.811]  It was shown to be a fraud.
[02:41:50.719 --> 02:41:53.142]  And now we're being told that there is no election fraud.
[02:41:53.182 --> 02:41:53.863]  It doesn't exist.
[02:41:54.103 --> 02:41:54.604]  No such thing.
[02:41:54.644 --> 02:41:55.404]  It's never happened.
[02:41:55.484 --> 02:41:55.705]  What?
[02:41:55.745 --> 02:41:56.345]  That's crazy.
[02:41:56.786 --> 02:41:58.588]  But no, people aren't buying that, right?
[02:41:58.988 --> 02:42:00.490]  70 million people plus vote for Trump.
[02:42:00.910 --> 02:42:02.111]  They know what's going on.
[02:42:02.272 --> 02:42:03.453]  They know that this is a fraud.
[02:42:03.493 --> 02:42:03.953]  It's a lie.
[02:42:03.993 --> 02:42:04.694]  And it's obvious.
[02:42:04.934 --> 02:42:06.696]  There's mountains of fraud.
[02:42:07.097 --> 02:42:09.099]  The idea that it doesn't exist is ludicrous.
[02:42:09.179 --> 02:42:12.923]  And I think the delusion is starting to break on the masses.
[02:42:14.571 --> 02:42:16.632]  Right, yeah, I basically have the same opinion.
[02:42:16.712 --> 02:42:23.894]  I think probably the worst case scenario is if the Democrats tried to steal this election, and then people didn't even know about it.
[02:42:23.954 --> 02:42:34.037]  Because there was probably a plausible scenario where widespread and mass voter fraud was committed, and the only people that were calling it out were called conspiracy theorists.
[02:42:34.417 --> 02:42:38.078]  It was a fringe sort of opinion to have that the election was stolen.
[02:42:38.378 --> 02:42:41.859]  But you see that most Republicans think that the election was stolen.
[02:42:42.535 --> 02:42:43.637]  And it was widespread.
[02:42:43.917 --> 02:42:44.658]  It was massive.
[02:42:44.718 --> 02:42:45.339]  It was blatant.
[02:42:45.679 --> 02:42:49.605]  And they really made a big mistake with that because it's not like this was a subtle voter fraud.
[02:42:49.645 --> 02:42:51.187]  This was massive voter fraud.
[02:42:51.527 --> 02:42:55.573]  Hundreds of thousands of fake ballots in just about every single swing state.
[02:42:55.833 --> 02:42:57.195]  This was a huge operation.
[02:42:57.893 --> 02:42:59.894]  And it's unignorable, and it's indefensible.
[02:43:00.295 --> 02:43:14.144]  And it's gotten to the point where people are waking up, the masses are talking about it on Twitter, they're taking to the streets, and whereas even the Republicans were content to ignore it for a time, now even they are being dragged into this fight like we're trying to do in Georgia with Brian Kemp.
[02:43:14.464 --> 02:43:22.169]  They're being dragged in, kicking and screaming, and I think this is maybe the best thing that can happen because it's destroying the legitimacy of the system.
[02:43:22.449 --> 02:43:22.989]  Well, that's right.
[02:43:23.049 --> 02:43:24.650]  Nobody wants to be robbed.
[02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:26.311]  But once you're robbed, you start fighting back.
[02:43:26.731 --> 02:43:27.691]  We're being robbed.
[02:43:27.731 --> 02:43:29.072]  There's a globalist takeover happening.
[02:43:29.832 --> 02:43:30.713]  Yes, right.
[02:43:30.813 --> 02:43:32.133]  And people can see that now.
[02:43:32.213 --> 02:43:36.315]  And for a long time, you've been talking about this for decades, for years.
[02:43:36.935 --> 02:43:41.638]  And it was, for many years, people thought that that was something that was out there.
[02:43:41.758 --> 02:43:43.478]  They thought that was some kind of a radical thing.
[02:43:43.518 --> 02:43:44.859]  That was just reading the books they wrote.
[02:43:45.479 --> 02:43:47.160]  Like Jay's doing now, and he's reading their new books.
[02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:48.481]  I mean, they admit all this.
[02:43:50.191 --> 02:43:52.233]  Right, well, the problem is they control the media.
[02:43:52.393 --> 02:43:57.498]  They control the media, so if all people are watching is network television, they're not going to talk about what they're writing.
[02:43:57.518 --> 02:43:58.720]  Did you see what the New York Times said?
[02:43:58.780 --> 02:43:59.861]  The Great Reset doesn't exist.
[02:44:01.102 --> 02:44:03.064]  I mean, what is the psychology there?
[02:44:03.584 --> 02:44:09.831]  Where they say we're going to take over, y'all have no more money, it's going to cut your carbon, we're going to starve you to death, it's good, but it doesn't exist.
[02:44:10.523 --> 02:44:13.084]  Well, and they do that with so many different narratives.
[02:44:13.384 --> 02:44:17.546]  And once they deny that it's happening, they say it about the Great Replacement.
[02:44:17.927 --> 02:44:25.770]  The reset is a conspiracy theory, but at the same time, World Economic Forum says, same day, this is what we're undertaking with the coronavirus.
[02:44:26.030 --> 02:44:29.372]  And I mentioned it a second ago, they say that with the Great Replacement as well.
[02:44:29.392 --> 02:44:33.494]  When you talk about mass immigration, you talk about the globalization of the population.
[02:44:33.934 --> 02:44:36.096]  ...through people pouring into Europe and America.
[02:44:36.437 --> 02:44:41.222]  They say that is some kind of horrible conspiracy theory, and then they turn around a few days later...
[02:44:41.986 --> 02:44:47.847]  And they'll write in the LA Times, The Hill, New York Times, Atlantic, that demographic change is turning America blue.
[02:44:47.907 --> 02:44:49.908]  Demographic change is saving the Democratic Party.
[02:44:49.928 --> 02:44:53.088]  Sure, the plan is, is, is, is, quote, the replacement migration.
[02:44:53.649 --> 02:45:02.411]  And then they get the folks here and don't condition them in a loving way about freedom and justice and capitalism, but instead it's about radical environmentalism, racism, post-industrial systems.
[02:45:04.651 --> 02:45:09.915]  What do you make right now of this press conference, the feedback you're getting, what's happening?
[02:45:09.935 --> 02:45:18.362]  Because at first it was kind of an uphill battle, and it's still an uphill battle, but as more evidence comes out, people are getting more optimistic, and the Democrats admit they're getting scared.
[02:45:18.382 --> 02:45:25.127]  Well, the first week, I should say, the first four days, we had 30,000 people turn out around the United States.
[02:45:25.547 --> 02:45:28.708]  Then that led us to a week later where we're in Washington, D.C.
[02:45:29.048 --> 02:45:34.449]  So we're looking at about 220,000 to 240,000, it turned out, across the nation.
[02:45:34.589 --> 02:45:36.090]  If you take the D.C.
[02:45:36.130 --> 02:45:37.630]  numbers and you put them low.
[02:45:38.270 --> 02:45:41.271]  And hopefully this weekend we'll have even more across the United States.
[02:45:41.291 --> 02:45:42.551]  But I want everybody to understand this.
[02:45:42.851 --> 02:45:49.213]  If there was no Stop the Steal, if people did not take the streets under different hashtags, different groups, who cares?
[02:45:49.473 --> 02:45:50.713]  Trump already capitulated.
[02:45:51.133 --> 02:46:01.279]  He would have conceded, there wouldn't have been room, there's all these traitors in the administration and the campaign, and we needed time for those people to leave, for the new legal team to come in.
[02:46:01.539 --> 02:46:02.860]  There was no Sidney Powell.
[02:46:03.140 --> 02:46:04.001]  There was no Rudy.
[02:46:04.261 --> 02:46:09.024]  And guess what, you know, Rudy's a little weird, not the best, but we're doing what we can for this country.
[02:46:09.404 --> 02:46:12.446]  All the insiders bailing has actually given us a chance to win.
[02:46:12.566 --> 02:46:14.587]  Right, and you know, the Bible says, out of the mouth of babes.
[02:46:14.607 --> 02:46:20.391]  So here we are, we are the misfits, we are the crazy ones, rushing the gate, but we are the ones winning.
[02:46:20.731 --> 02:46:23.853]  Last night in Michigan, you and I actually broke news.
[02:46:24.134 --> 02:46:29.717]  People could tell, you know, I said, hey, you're gonna have news in the morning coming out of Michigan with these two brave people.
[02:46:30.138 --> 02:46:31.358]  They're gonna hold the line.
[02:46:31.699 --> 02:46:36.682]  It was then announced late that night, after the periscope that you and I did, that they did hold the line.
[02:46:37.022 --> 02:46:41.123]  Wisconsin this morning held the line, and so they're not going to certify their election.
[02:46:41.363 --> 02:46:50.785]  And here we are in Georgia, telling Brian Kemp that you're going to get a primary, or you're going to call a special session to relieve yourself of duty so the state legislator can choose the electors.
[02:46:50.965 --> 02:46:51.765]  We're winning, Alex.
[02:46:51.885 --> 02:46:52.285]  We're winning.
[02:46:52.325 --> 02:46:53.045]  The tide is turning.
[02:46:53.125 --> 02:46:59.367]  And again, we're pessimistic when things are pessimistic, but we're going to talk more about the internals of this and the externals of this.
[02:47:00.427 --> 02:47:03.031]  Again, this is an amazing time of your life.
[02:47:03.052 --> 02:47:04.133]  This is amazing.
[02:47:04.734 --> 02:47:13.088]  Behind the scenes, everybody uses the word surreal because we've all been talking about this on our platforms, different aspects of it, but no one thought we'd live it now, right?
[02:47:14.105 --> 02:47:17.069]  Well yeah, it's a world historical moment, and we're living through it.
[02:47:17.169 --> 02:47:24.838]  And the thing that we have been talking about for years, and people older than me talking about this for decades, we're now seeing them make their move.
[02:47:24.918 --> 02:47:29.904]  The move that we talked about for so long, and people said it was a conspiracy theory.
[02:47:29.944 --> 02:47:30.805]  That's crazy!
[02:47:31.125 --> 02:47:32.587]  They could never do something like this.
[02:47:33.243 --> 02:47:34.244]  We're seeing it happen.
[02:47:34.484 --> 02:47:38.668]  The coronavirus, the mass riots, the huge election fraud, the lockdowns.
[02:47:39.048 --> 02:47:47.175]  You know, if you had said five years ago that the globalists are going to tell us, you know, the World Economic Forum and the UN would tell us, it's not legal to go to a church.
[02:47:47.515 --> 02:47:49.356]  It's not legal to open your business.
[02:47:50.137 --> 02:47:51.038]  Nobody would believe it.
[02:47:51.178 --> 02:47:52.639]  Oh, but you can go riot.
[02:47:54.045 --> 02:47:54.245]  Right.
[02:47:54.325 --> 02:48:06.517]  Well, and if people told you years ago that there would be giant riots in the cities and the media would never cover it, that in fact actually they would call them peaceful protests, that they would make up out of thin air, they talk about right-wing militias going to these things.
[02:48:06.997 --> 02:48:09.700]  I see the looting going on at the liquor stores and the Targets.
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:11.502]  It is definitely not right-wing militias.
[02:48:11.522 --> 02:48:15.205]  This is a multinational globalist attack to overthrow civilization and make us slaves.
[02:48:15.646 --> 02:48:17.968]  And they never get in trouble, so that's why they keep trying it.
[02:48:18.368 --> 02:48:21.010]  That's what I was going to say on my own show today in the main body.
[02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:22.211]  We'll come back for a break and get into this.
[02:48:22.732 --> 02:48:24.033]  How do we punish these globalists?
[02:48:24.073 --> 02:48:30.118]  How do we make people know that this is modern warfare and criminal and a violation of the Nuremberg Code here?
[02:48:31.676 --> 02:48:32.036]  How do we?
[02:48:32.076 --> 02:48:34.497]  Well, we do that by continuing to do what we're doing right now.
[02:48:34.617 --> 02:48:38.278]  So, we are getting, you know, mass numbers, mass awakening.
[02:48:38.358 --> 02:48:44.120]  I've had explosive growth through, you know, you letting me come on and talk about the Great Reset and stuff.
[02:48:44.140 --> 02:48:46.501]  I mean, this is... Let's just everybody look at the periods making you explode.
[02:48:46.961 --> 02:48:48.181]  Stay there when we come back.
[02:48:48.241 --> 02:48:54.343]  Let's talk about your ideas of how we fight now during this crazy time because resistance is the key.
[02:48:55.264 --> 02:48:56.204]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:48:57.611 --> 02:48:58.652]  And we are back.
[02:48:58.752 --> 02:49:02.697]  I'm Alex Jones with Ali Alexander, Nick Fuentes, and of course, Jay Dyer.
[02:49:02.737 --> 02:49:05.200]  And Jay, you are getting into their endgame.
[02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:07.002]  Where are they going to take us if we don't submit?
[02:49:07.462 --> 02:49:11.907]  And then how do we identify these folks and the war they're waging and actually let them know they're going to be punished?
[02:49:12.187 --> 02:49:17.874]  There's going to be retribution because they feel like we're just animals and it doesn't matter how they test on us as guinea pigs.
[02:49:18.462 --> 02:49:22.306]  Well, if you look at history, every time empires have tried to do this, they crumble.
[02:49:22.686 --> 02:49:28.571]  They're not able to sustain what they try to do, because to run this gigantic of an empire, it requires a whole lot of lies.
[02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:32.195]  You have to constantly prop up the lies, and this lie is especially
[02:49:33.058 --> 02:49:36.521]  Unique, because it's global and it's including all this tech stuff.
[02:49:36.541 --> 02:49:38.943]  So what I was saying is that it's a spiritual delusion.
[02:49:38.983 --> 02:49:45.848]  That's the main problem is that people think that if I go along for this amount of time, if I go along for a little longer, oh, it's going to go away.
[02:49:46.048 --> 02:49:49.351]  Oh, if Biden goes, comes to, he'll eventually get rid of this.
[02:49:49.631 --> 02:49:50.632]  No, it's not going away.
[02:49:50.652 --> 02:49:51.752]  They're sucking you in.
[02:49:52.033 --> 02:49:52.293]  Yes.
[02:49:52.833 --> 02:49:57.036]  It's a- Getting in the creeper van with the child molester doesn't save you.
[02:49:57.377 --> 02:49:59.678]  You know, buying the lottery ticket doesn't save you.
[02:49:59.979 --> 02:50:01.440]  Going with a scam only gets you deeper.
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:04.002]  Yeah, it's a psychic vampirism.
[02:50:04.043 --> 02:50:09.829]  They get off on you buying into the delusion, and if you stop buying into the delusion, it goes away.
[02:50:09.889 --> 02:50:12.492]  Like, that's the only way to fight, is to stop buying into the delusion.
[02:50:12.512 --> 02:50:13.373]  And that's what Trump said.
[02:50:13.433 --> 02:50:14.434]  Just get used to it.
[02:50:15.676 --> 02:50:18.338]  Dr. Atlas said it's basically a giant hoax.
[02:50:19.019 --> 02:50:20.681]  You have to resist this and rise up.
[02:50:20.701 --> 02:50:22.003]  I mean, finally, Trump gets it.
[02:50:22.588 --> 02:50:23.308]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:23.569 --> 02:50:29.012]  And he's been saying for a long time, he's been saying in speeches that this is a bunch of nonsense, it's ridiculous.
[02:50:29.032 --> 02:50:30.612]  I mean, how absurd is it?
[02:50:30.973 --> 02:50:38.677]  The same CNN scientists that say that this is not going to attack a rally that involves looting and rioting.
[02:50:38.697 --> 02:50:44.040]  They had a study saying, studies show Black Lives Matter helps stop coronavirus, but Trump rallies hurt it.
[02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:46.241]  No, it actually gets even dumber.
[02:50:46.981 --> 02:50:50.823]  We predicted this too, that they would declare racism a health crisis.
[02:50:50.863 --> 02:51:01.067]  So the health directors of major cities decided to give Black Lives Matter and Antifa thugs a pass by declaring racism a health emergency.
[02:51:01.127 --> 02:51:05.728]  So they're like, well, even if there is a coronavirus bump, this was more of a health emergency.
[02:51:06.088 --> 02:51:08.810]  We are living in a world where- You have dark skin.
[02:51:08.850 --> 02:51:10.650]  You get Bill Gates's vaccine first.
[02:51:11.050 --> 02:51:11.951]  We really care about you.
[02:51:13.071 --> 02:51:17.195]  And why didn't Anthony Fauci give every black American vitamin D?
[02:51:17.435 --> 02:51:26.283]  That costs $25 a year to give everyone a year's supply of vitamin D. Black folks need a lot more sun, and so they need more vitamin D. No S at the end.
[02:51:26.483 --> 02:51:28.165]  The black folk, no.
[02:51:28.665 --> 02:51:33.970]  But look, white people, they can go out in the sun, they need a half hour of vitamin D from the sun a day.
[02:51:34.230 --> 02:51:36.833]  Black people need an average of three hours.
[02:51:37.393 --> 02:51:43.536]  Oprah actually says that she's fat because she lives in Chicago and it's too cloudy, so there's a whole big controversy about that.
[02:51:43.956 --> 02:51:44.496]  Well, maybe.
[02:51:45.557 --> 02:51:46.557]  Could be that she eats a lot.
[02:51:48.909 --> 02:51:52.150]  So that's what's going on is they don't actually care about our immune system.
[02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:57.771]  People have to remember in late February, they came out and said that you cannot boost your immune system.
[02:51:57.811 --> 02:51:58.431]  Go look at it.
[02:51:58.811 --> 02:52:01.172]  And so what we do know is that you need to be taking zinc.
[02:52:01.472 --> 02:52:05.153]  You need to be taking vitamin D. You can take some magnesium and some other stuff.
[02:52:05.233 --> 02:52:07.794]  But look, I've traveled this whole pandemic and I'm fine.
[02:52:07.854 --> 02:52:08.694]  I'm glad you brought this up.
[02:52:09.034 --> 02:52:10.754]  They always go, my God, they're not wearing masks.
[02:52:11.014 --> 02:52:12.455]  500,000 or more at the Capitol.
[02:52:12.755 --> 02:52:13.295]  Where are we?
[02:52:13.375 --> 02:52:14.555]  I'm at hundreds of these rallies.
[02:52:14.615 --> 02:52:16.596]  I'm great because I'm taking zinc, vitamin C.
[02:52:17.793 --> 02:52:18.373]  Yeah, totally.
[02:52:18.413 --> 02:52:21.655]  Well, and it's a war against our bodies, it's a war against our minds.
[02:52:22.056 --> 02:52:22.976]  It always has been.
[02:52:23.416 --> 02:52:27.859]  And, you know, you talk about psychic vampirism, it's also a form of biological vampirism.
[02:52:27.899 --> 02:52:31.361]  I think the endgame for them is, really, it's about immortality.
[02:52:31.661 --> 02:52:39.026]  When you start to get into transhumanism and what they want to do integrating the biological with the machine, I think it's... They want to test on us.
[02:52:39.586 --> 02:52:39.946]  They do.
[02:52:40.147 --> 02:52:48.173]  And we are all supposed to be fed into this great big societal machine, like Toil and Green basically, so that they can live forever.
[02:52:48.253 --> 02:52:52.396]  I think that people like George Soros and... We are all expendable.
[02:52:52.836 --> 02:52:53.517]  That's right.
[02:52:53.537 --> 02:52:55.959]  And we are all going to die essentially.
[02:52:55.999 --> 02:53:01.103]  They will steal our life force so that they can perpetuate themselves, this like technocratic elite.
[02:53:01.123 --> 02:53:02.444]  It's disgusting what they're doing.
[02:53:02.464 --> 02:53:03.605]  And they say that themselves.
[02:53:04.065 --> 02:53:04.425]  They do.
[02:53:05.065 --> 02:53:06.226]  And they're not even hiding it.
[02:53:06.286 --> 02:53:07.346]  That's the scariest thing.
[02:53:07.646 --> 02:53:11.327]  People don't know about it because it's those people that control all the media.
[02:53:11.367 --> 02:53:11.988]  If they don't talk about it.
[02:53:12.008 --> 02:53:15.549]  So I don't want to go to the election, but the election is just an expression of this takeover.
[02:53:15.929 --> 02:53:17.169]  And they were arrogant before.
[02:53:17.189 --> 02:53:20.110]  We were exposing them and beavering and getting the word out.
[02:53:20.430 --> 02:53:21.030]  Millions were.
[02:53:21.471 --> 02:53:24.432]  They've got to be freaked out now because we already told everybody it's coming.
[02:53:24.732 --> 02:53:26.132]  Now they've launched the attack.
[02:53:26.632 --> 02:53:27.693]  It's not going to go the way they thought.
[02:53:27.953 --> 02:53:28.753]  Jay Dyer, what do you think?
[02:53:29.417 --> 02:53:35.019]  Well, yeah, I mean, you're able to have within a week a gigantic crowd, a million in D.C.
[02:53:35.099 --> 02:53:35.960]  This is insane, right?
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:41.042]  So this is a message to the media that no matter how many lies and no matter how much B.S.
[02:53:41.082 --> 02:53:42.822]  you clamp on everybody's mind.
[02:53:42.862 --> 02:53:44.123]  We're becoming immune to your horse manure.
[02:53:44.203 --> 02:53:45.143]  It's not working.
[02:53:45.223 --> 02:53:46.124]  It's falling apart.
[02:53:46.304 --> 02:53:49.625]  And within no time, people can show up at a rally, right?
[02:53:49.725 --> 02:53:50.686]  I can drive six hours.
[02:53:50.726 --> 02:53:51.086]  We're here.
[02:53:51.126 --> 02:53:51.606]  People are here.
[02:53:52.792 --> 02:53:54.633]  That is, I think, a threat to the media.
[02:53:54.653 --> 02:53:56.234]  The media knows that they are losing.
[02:53:56.614 --> 02:53:58.295]  They've been doubling down.
[02:53:58.796 --> 02:53:59.596]  They won't back off.
[02:53:59.636 --> 02:54:00.397]  They double down.
[02:54:00.757 --> 02:54:01.737]  And it only hurts them.
[02:54:01.918 --> 02:54:03.138]  So they're destroying themselves.
[02:54:03.158 --> 02:54:04.339]  That's our greatest advantage.
[02:54:06.889 --> 02:54:11.613]  They should not, it was swabbing, they should not have money to be able to come here and protest us.
[02:54:11.653 --> 02:54:12.714]  We must make them poor.
[02:54:12.974 --> 02:54:14.035]  That's a quote I've got to pull up.
[02:54:14.396 --> 02:54:16.578]  He said we want to make them poor so they can't protest us.
[02:54:16.818 --> 02:54:21.922]  That's all this is, they stole all the wealth, now they want to bankrupt us so we're like, literally can't even get food.
[02:54:22.723 --> 02:54:25.265]  It's it's a... For your own good, I'm going to do it for you.
[02:54:25.766 --> 02:54:28.969]  He's got a Blofeld, little bellies out, he's got a little suit on.
[02:54:29.309 --> 02:54:31.831]  He's like, I'm going to love you by killing you.
[02:54:31.851 --> 02:54:35.774]  He's wearing like space medallions like he's from from space.
[02:54:35.815 --> 02:54:36.835]  You're talking about aliens.
[02:54:36.935 --> 02:54:39.638]  In that video that they put out that actually Twitter deleted that.
[02:54:39.678 --> 02:54:39.838]  Did you
[02:54:39.858 --> 02:54:42.819]  We want you to take chips and humans are bad and there's an alien going to help you!
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:00.500]  Obviously, is it interdimensional?
[02:55:00.520 --> 02:55:01.201]  Is it spiritual?
[02:55:01.541 --> 02:55:01.961]  How are they?
[02:55:02.501 --> 02:55:03.281]  They want to be the aliens.
[02:55:03.301 --> 02:55:05.421]  Like Ray Kurzweil said, I don't believe in God.
[02:55:05.441 --> 02:55:06.242]  I'm going to be God.
[02:55:06.342 --> 02:55:09.462]  Well, if you watch a bunch of alien movies, what are the aliens always doing?
[02:55:09.582 --> 02:55:10.743]  The very thing that the elites do.
[02:55:10.843 --> 02:55:16.664]  So I think in movies, aliens represent our elite because they always want to depopulate.
[02:55:16.704 --> 02:55:17.604]  We're the Morlocks.
[02:55:17.664 --> 02:55:18.344]  We're the Eloi.
[02:55:18.604 --> 02:55:20.865]  Yeah, you're not evolved, right?
[02:55:20.925 --> 02:55:22.945]  You don't have gigantic heads like the aliens have.
[02:55:23.945 --> 02:55:26.106]  You need to be experimented on.
[02:55:26.206 --> 02:55:27.006]  Speak for yourself.
[02:55:31.107 --> 02:55:31.968]  Alex, you got a big face.
[02:55:31.988 --> 02:55:32.910]  I don't know about a big head.
[02:55:34.331 --> 02:55:37.536]  No, but it's interesting too because these aliens usually are naked, right?
[02:55:37.836 --> 02:55:39.078]  And they're not ashamed of their nakedness.
[02:55:39.658 --> 02:55:41.421]  And they're without sin.
[02:55:41.481 --> 02:55:45.105]  They're, you know, these pre-human creatures, pre-garden creatures.
[02:55:45.546 --> 02:55:46.988]  It's just, it's all stupid.
[02:55:47.068 --> 02:55:49.071]  It's really kind of interesting that we're all talking about
[02:55:50.486 --> 02:55:54.649]  But yes, they want, they believe in eternal life, and we believe in eternal life.
[02:55:54.929 --> 02:55:57.571]  But they believe that heaven must be manifested here.
[02:55:57.831 --> 02:56:00.413]  We have to submit and give up our free will to make heaven.
[02:56:00.733 --> 02:56:03.955]  God says we have free will, and then choose freedom and we get heaven.
[02:56:03.995 --> 02:56:09.699]  Right, and so this is the last fight, and it's amazing what everyone has been able to accomplish together.
[02:56:09.979 --> 02:56:12.461]  When I'm on the phone, I mean, you've watched me, I take about 150 calls now a day.
[02:56:14.262 --> 02:56:15.442]  And it's, there's no ego.
[02:56:15.582 --> 02:56:17.923]  Everyone's just put bodies in the streets.
[02:56:18.003 --> 02:56:19.803]  No staging, no permits, no lights.
[02:56:20.203 --> 02:56:21.783]  Don't ask me to make a speech candidate.
[02:56:22.043 --> 02:56:24.504]  It's all about just fighting the system.
[02:56:24.784 --> 02:56:26.164]  And what I'm telling you is, I think this.
[02:56:26.464 --> 02:56:28.325]  I think we were at the 99 out of 100.
[02:56:28.765 --> 02:56:29.885]  We were about to die.
[02:56:30.405 --> 02:56:32.065]  And they need us to be their slaves.
[02:56:32.325 --> 02:56:34.666]  So the good thing is that we can't lose if we stay in the streets.
[02:56:34.726 --> 02:56:37.946]  We cannot lose because they need slaves to build the pyramids.
[02:56:38.367 --> 02:56:40.547]  And I'm not building their damn pyramid.
[02:56:41.135 --> 02:56:45.163]  Well, if they were building a pyramid, and we were all free, I'd build pyramids.
[02:56:45.183 --> 02:56:45.924]  That's a metaphor.
[02:56:45.944 --> 02:56:46.926]  I know it's a metaphor.
[02:56:47.844 --> 02:56:49.526]  But is that really a metaphor?
[02:56:49.666 --> 02:56:51.368]  It could be an analogy.
[02:56:51.388 --> 02:56:53.009]  I don't know if I understand the difference.
[02:56:53.049 --> 02:56:53.930]  No, no, you're right.
[02:56:54.010 --> 02:56:56.373]  It's a hierarchical up-down situation.
[02:56:57.294 --> 02:56:58.675]  But they're doing it to end us.
[02:56:58.735 --> 02:57:00.377]  They have cynicism for us.
[02:57:00.817 --> 02:57:04.721]  And when we act like idiots and aren't informed and don't resist, they say we deserve it.
[02:57:04.761 --> 02:57:07.184]  So that's why what we're doing is key metaphysically.
[02:57:07.504 --> 02:57:10.687]  We'll be right back on the other side with all of my great guests in studio.
[02:57:10.707 --> 02:57:11.088]  Stay with us.
[02:57:12.668 --> 02:57:22.639]  So we've got quite the crew here with Allie Alexander, Nick Fuentes, Jay Dyer, you're truly Alex Jones, and we're streaming out on Allie's Periscope right now.
[02:57:22.979 --> 02:57:24.260]  So let's get into the meat and potatoes.
[02:57:24.281 --> 02:57:27.744]  You guys didn't see the press conference, you got a lot of feedback, but just overall, the victories.
[02:57:27.804 --> 02:57:29.726]  Recap, starting with Nick Fuentes.
[02:57:30.547 --> 02:57:34.410]  Uh, the good news coming out, I mean, because the more we fight, the more we prove the fraud.
[02:57:34.430 --> 02:57:36.111]  We're supposed to just give up and not investigate.
[02:57:36.392 --> 02:57:37.052]  We know the frauds.
[02:57:37.092 --> 02:57:40.395]  There are thousands of affidavits, eyewitnesses, all the Veritas videos.
[02:57:40.755 --> 02:57:45.338]  The left's starting to really get that pucker factor, because all their previous frauds have failed.
[02:57:45.979 --> 02:57:49.001]  Yeah, well, Bill Kristol tweeted earlier this afternoon.
[02:57:49.061 --> 02:57:50.142]  He said, I'm alarmed.
[02:57:50.683 --> 02:57:53.605]  That was actually a really good feeling, and he's nervous because
[02:57:54.409 --> 02:57:57.132]  In each state, state by state, we're getting really good news.
[02:57:57.172 --> 02:58:04.479]  Like last night, for example, or I think it was yesterday evening, yesterday night, in Wayne County in Michigan, which is so important.
[02:58:05.291 --> 02:58:07.974]  All these votes are coming in in Detroit for Joe Biden.
[02:58:07.994 --> 02:58:14.019]  Almost his entire lead in Michigan is contained in Detroit specifically, and a lot of that is in Wayne County.
[02:58:14.419 --> 02:58:22.347]  A couple of days ago, they initially wanted to resist certifying the results from Wayne County because of all the fraud going on in Detroit.
[02:58:22.767 --> 02:58:28.592]  Eventually, they relented because the Republicans that were on the committee were receiving death threats and being harassed.
[02:58:29.033 --> 02:58:30.454]  We got the word yesterday.
[02:58:31.235 --> 02:58:36.077]  Or might have been earlier today, that they rescinded their certification of the results in Wayne County.
[02:58:36.578 --> 02:58:42.181]  Meaning, basically, that Joe Biden's margin in Detroit is basically in question now, if they'll certify those results.
[02:58:42.961 --> 02:58:45.842]  Either way, it stalls the process, which is a win for us.
[02:58:46.243 --> 02:58:55.487]  Additionally, in the press conference, I didn't see the whole thing, but I saw that Rudy Giuliani said that they have enough provably illegitimate votes that it would flip the election.
[02:58:55.607 --> 02:59:00.490]  And that is a huge deal, because Rudy Giuliani is the main and maybe one of the only lawyers working
[02:59:01.190 --> 02:59:02.551]  Out of the whole Trump team on this.
[02:59:02.591 --> 02:59:05.453]  I've heard some news from the campaign that's not so good.
[02:59:05.493 --> 02:59:07.755]  I guess there are some people that are giving up on the inside.
[02:59:08.115 --> 02:59:12.558]  But Rudy Giuliani has come out and said that we have the proof.
[02:59:12.998 --> 02:59:13.879]  Sunshine Patriots.
[02:59:13.899 --> 02:59:14.960]  They're all looking for their next job.
[02:59:15.400 --> 02:59:16.401]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:59:16.501 --> 02:59:19.423]  And I'm so glad that John McIntyre is working in the White House.
[02:59:19.443 --> 02:59:20.844]  He's the head of their PPO.
[02:59:20.864 --> 02:59:22.505]  This guy is a real patriot.
[02:59:22.525 --> 02:59:24.906]  And the lady that won't allow the transfer.
[02:59:27.503 --> 02:59:27.924]  That's right.
[02:59:27.964 --> 02:59:28.524]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:59:28.564 --> 02:59:31.567]  And McEntee said if you're looking for another job, you're fired.
[02:59:31.627 --> 02:59:32.528]  And that's how it should be.
[02:59:32.848 --> 02:59:34.330]  That's how it should have been from the beginning.
[02:59:34.390 --> 02:59:37.613]  They should have kept the people from the Trump campaign and put them in the White House.
[02:59:37.633 --> 02:59:43.178]  A lot of the problem is they filled it up with Republican committee people and Rubio alum and so on.
[02:59:43.258 --> 02:59:44.820]  What is it left today?
[02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:45.000]  60 days?
[02:59:45.020 --> 02:59:45.280]  59 days?
[02:59:45.340 --> 02:59:46.822]  My God, this countdown is incredible.
[02:59:47.122 --> 02:59:48.523]  It's moving very rapidly.
[02:59:49.184 --> 02:59:50.926]  Yeah, and we're getting very close.
[02:59:51.046 --> 02:59:59.955]  I think the good thing is, and this is maybe the most encouraging fact, is if we pull this off, can you imagine how pissed off President Trump will be when he gets inaugurated?
[03:00:00.196 --> 03:00:01.317]  And at all the right people.
[03:00:01.557 --> 03:00:03.339]  He'll have a White House full of loyalists.
[03:00:03.379 --> 03:00:03.920]  No more games!
[03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:09.986]  No games, no saboteurs, no fakers, no sunshine GOP people.
[03:00:10.486 --> 03:00:12.528]  It will turn into the permanent revolution.
[03:00:12.588 --> 03:00:15.672]  That will turn into the war presidency that it should have been in 2016.
[03:00:15.832 --> 03:00:18.374]  And not a war overseas, a war to get our republic back.
[03:00:18.715 --> 03:00:19.355]  That's right, yeah.
[03:00:19.395 --> 03:00:21.398]  Not a war in Iraq or in Afghanistan.
[03:00:21.438 --> 03:00:23.680]  A war right here, and specifically in D.C.
[03:00:23.740 --> 03:00:24.961]  against the swamp people.
[03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:28.401]  Uh, what do you want me to answer?
[03:00:28.421 --> 03:00:29.661]  Well, go back through.
[03:00:29.681 --> 03:00:34.363]  People are tuning in all the time about the big wins that are happening in Georgia, in Michigan.
[03:00:34.383 --> 03:00:35.384]  Some big stuff's going down.
[03:00:35.784 --> 03:00:44.448]  So, in Wisconsin today, two Republicans decided on the elections board to not certify the election.
[03:00:44.748 --> 03:00:46.229]  So, Wisconsin is holding its own.
[03:00:47.129 --> 03:00:48.290]  Late, late last night,
[03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:57.533]  The two original dissenters in Wayne County decided that they did pass a vote for a conditional certification.
[03:00:57.773 --> 03:01:05.656]  They're now retracting that and saying, we were under duress, we were threatened, and they do have 24-7 security.
[03:01:05.976 --> 03:01:07.557]  So that's all taken care of, folks.
[03:01:07.577 --> 03:01:12.198]  We've got good patriots watching over any brave patriot who's in the system and wants to follow that.
[03:01:12.218 --> 03:01:14.419]  I was on the phone when you were trying to get them security and all that.
[03:01:14.819 --> 03:01:16.700]  But this is all just grassroots doing it all, folks.
[03:01:17.260 --> 03:01:20.943]  Well, you know, I'm not going to take credit publicly, but thank you.
[03:01:21.483 --> 03:01:28.588]  And so, if we keep that certification at the county level, then the Michigan Secretary of State cannot certify.
[03:01:28.668 --> 03:01:31.930]  She is a B-word, and she is a Democrat.
[03:01:32.190 --> 03:01:38.514]  And so, that's good, because then it makes the Michigan State Houses say, well, we need to take our proper and constitutional role.
[03:01:38.854 --> 03:01:43.137]  Here in Georgia, we're waiting for Governor— There's a bunch of followers in the legislatures.
[03:01:43.177 --> 03:01:43.978]  We have to be the leaders.
[03:01:44.498 --> 03:01:44.678]  Right.
[03:01:45.098 --> 03:01:49.640]  And here in Georgia, we're petitioning the governor to call a special session.
[03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:51.440]  That is the chant that we are using here.
[03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:54.201]  And what I got last night was a flurry.
[03:01:54.581 --> 03:02:00.123]  Dozens of members of the State House and State Senate were texting each other saying, oh my gosh, do we need to come in?
[03:02:00.463 --> 03:02:03.344]  Our careers could go down with Brad's and down with Brian's.
[03:02:03.664 --> 03:02:04.204]  So that was good.
[03:02:04.224 --> 03:02:07.185]  I used to live here for three years, so we've got our ear to the ground.
[03:02:07.285 --> 03:02:09.386]  And again, that Vernon Jones guy is amazing.
[03:02:09.426 --> 03:02:10.286]  He used to be a Democrat.
[03:02:10.346 --> 03:02:11.226]  He's now a Republican.
[03:02:11.246 --> 03:02:12.467]  He had a great speech yesterday.
[03:02:13.047 --> 03:02:16.409]  So we heard days ago the government was going to make this announcement internally.
[03:02:16.449 --> 03:02:17.169]  What is the announcement?
[03:02:17.789 --> 03:02:19.750]  The announcement should have been yesterday.
[03:02:19.810 --> 03:02:30.456]  So this is either really, I was telling Alex this yesterday, this is either really good, I was telling Roger this, this is either really good news, because it means that we've actually made him have more of a spine.
[03:02:30.496 --> 03:02:37.859]  He was already going to come our way a little bit, but now he might have to come our way all the way, or it's really bad and he's going to just dig his nasty heels in.
[03:02:38.159 --> 03:02:41.521]  But I told him, primary or special session, you choose.
[03:02:41.681 --> 03:02:43.702]  I've got a question for you that's all the way down the line here.
[03:02:44.822 --> 03:02:53.264]  If, just in a nutshell, if they're able to put their little Crypt Keeper puppet creature in there, what does that do to America?
[03:02:53.364 --> 03:02:54.084]  Just your salt.
[03:02:54.264 --> 03:02:59.706]  Versus, if we prove it's a fraud and put Trump in, then they go really crazy.
[03:03:00.874 --> 03:03:01.134]  Right.
[03:03:01.174 --> 03:03:09.960]  So one thing that reminded me of, if you remember, you know, Quigley, Biden, Clinton, that nexus is all about the third way.
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:18.665]  And the third way idea was to merge the West and its capitalism with the communism of Eurasia to have this synthesis that they call the third way.
[03:03:19.225 --> 03:03:28.292]  And that was something that Clinton was a big proponent of, and you're getting, I think, with Biden that nexus, that merging.
[03:03:28.332 --> 03:03:29.353]  Oh, that's the admitted plan?
[03:03:29.593 --> 03:03:30.093]  Yes, exactly.
[03:03:30.113 --> 03:03:33.416]  Which they tell the minions, oh, we're going to merge capitals and commas, and we really just all become slaves.
[03:03:33.616 --> 03:03:37.399]  Well, if Biden is in, that's the trek that we're going to take.
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:44.866]  If it's reversed and if Trump is elected, which I think he was, I think he won, I don't think there's any question about it.
[03:03:44.906 --> 03:03:50.172]  I think it's so obvious that there was so much... I mean the mere fact that they stopped the states...
[03:03:51.047 --> 03:03:51.667]  They stopped?
[03:03:51.767 --> 03:03:54.068]  Has this ever happened before?
[03:03:54.088 --> 03:03:54.829]  They're just stopping?
[03:03:54.849 --> 03:03:55.829]  No, it's incredibly obvious.
[03:03:56.109 --> 03:03:56.609]  Preposterous.
[03:03:56.629 --> 03:03:57.850]  And how did all the states do it together?
[03:03:57.870 --> 03:03:58.570]  It was coordinated.
[03:03:58.590 --> 03:03:59.451]  Exactly, it was coordinated.
[03:03:59.471 --> 03:04:00.331]  It had to be coordinated.
[03:04:00.651 --> 03:04:06.013]  And so that means that what we will get is a, I mean, people are going to riot in the streets.
[03:04:06.093 --> 03:04:13.356]  Now, I would rather face people mad in the streets with Trump elected than a globalist commie takeover and an endless lockdown.
[03:04:13.396 --> 03:04:13.937]  I agree.
[03:04:14.357 --> 03:04:15.097]  But think about that.
[03:04:15.157 --> 03:04:15.677]  It's a key.
[03:04:15.737 --> 03:04:17.278]  As Giuliani said, it's all coordinated.
[03:04:17.298 --> 03:04:18.879]  I think Giuliani did a great job.
[03:04:19.799 --> 03:04:20.459]  Look at that!
[03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:29.183]  All those five states at the same time shut down and stopped counting, but then secretly kept counting.
[03:04:29.223 --> 03:04:34.866]  How could they say that there's no evidence of fraud when that is the most obvious fact of fraud and chicanery?
[03:04:34.886 --> 03:04:36.046]  Yeah, who made that call?
[03:04:36.106 --> 03:04:36.747]  That's ludicrous.
[03:04:38.687 --> 03:04:42.049]  Yeah, look folks, this is what I think has been missing from
[03:04:43.211 --> 03:04:44.832]  From people, well, you know, Fox News.
[03:04:45.032 --> 03:04:45.492]  Forget them.
[03:04:45.792 --> 03:04:52.455]  But what Tucker Carlson's show should be is to get a political science up there for an hour and describe demographics.
[03:04:52.835 --> 03:05:02.980]  Because people like me are dying to tell the public, you can't win Florida and Ohio by larger margins and then suddenly lose white people in the Rust Belt where Trump is strong.
[03:05:03.400 --> 03:05:04.941]  I know they stole Wisconsin.
[03:05:05.061 --> 03:05:05.741]  And white men.
[03:05:05.981 --> 03:05:09.043]  You're dating blacks, Hispanics, and women, but not white men.
[03:05:09.063 --> 03:05:10.944]  Because those white men are dead, folks.
[03:05:11.864 --> 03:05:13.345]  Yeah, well, there's a lot of that.
[03:05:13.385 --> 03:05:14.406]  And then there's women making names.
[03:05:14.446 --> 03:05:16.388]  White dudes are voting Biden in.
[03:05:16.588 --> 03:05:16.968]  Right, right.
[03:05:17.228 --> 03:05:22.952]  So remember, if you guys don't remember the headlines, Trump loses seniors, COVID response inadequate.
[03:05:23.533 --> 03:05:25.874]  Well, then why weren't we 20 points behind in Florida?
[03:05:26.195 --> 03:05:27.936]  We were never going to lose Florida.
[03:05:27.956 --> 03:05:31.979]  Trump won all those states with bigger margins, was winning, the disputed ones with bigger margins.
[03:05:32.179 --> 03:05:33.199]  Until they shut it down.
[03:05:33.239 --> 03:05:33.480]  Right.
[03:05:33.660 --> 03:05:43.724]  And so people like me who have worked a hundred federal campaigns want to say South Carolina's first congressional district, Arizona and Florida will tell you what white retirees are doing.
[03:05:44.184 --> 03:05:46.365]  And we knew that they weren't abandoning us.
[03:05:46.405 --> 03:05:49.686]  We know that we had a small dip in them, but we knew we weren't losing them by a double margin.
[03:05:49.706 --> 03:05:50.346]  Here's an analogy.
[03:05:50.387 --> 03:05:51.307]  The polling's a lie.
[03:05:51.347 --> 03:05:56.569]  You're watching a NASCAR race and there's a car a whole lap ahead.
[03:05:56.909 --> 03:06:01.091]  They turn the lights off for five minutes and that car's crashed and the other cars are ahead of it.
[03:06:01.291 --> 03:06:03.020]  You're like, you're like, this is a fraud.
[03:06:03.141 --> 03:06:04.407]  I mean, it's a scam.
[03:06:04.568 --> 03:06:05.413]  It's a total scam.
[03:06:06.764 --> 03:06:14.328]  Well, and what's amazing, and you pointed this out a moment ago, they literally, I think you pointed it out too, just stopped counting the votes.
[03:06:14.528 --> 03:06:18.250]  And it just so happened to occur in literally every single swing state.
[03:06:18.330 --> 03:06:27.555]  And I remember because I did marathon coverage of the election, and at a certain point they said, well, the people counting the ballots in Pennsylvania are going home because they're tired.
[03:06:27.915 --> 03:06:28.255]  Really?
[03:06:28.355 --> 03:06:30.536]  It's election night and they're tired and they're going home?
[03:06:30.937 --> 03:06:33.078]  In some states they were saying, I think in Nevada,
[03:06:33.758 --> 03:06:35.560]  Well, it's taking much longer to count them.
[03:06:35.580 --> 03:06:36.841]  The water mains burst, too.
[03:06:37.541 --> 03:06:38.302]  Oh, that's right.
[03:06:38.342 --> 03:06:39.183]  Yeah, in Atlanta.
[03:06:39.623 --> 03:06:40.964]  Well, the water main burst.
[03:06:41.184 --> 03:06:42.706]  It only took them two hours to repair.
[03:06:43.556 --> 03:06:48.919]  Yeah, it took them two hours to repair, but they had to resume counting the votes 24 hours later.
[03:06:49.019 --> 03:06:51.281]  It took them 24 hours to begin counting again.
[03:06:51.861 --> 03:06:55.943]  All right, Ali Alexander's bouncing off the wall, so am I. We've got Jay Dyer.
[03:06:56.644 --> 03:06:58.145]  Of course, we've got Nick Fuentes.
[03:06:58.165 --> 03:06:59.545]  So, closing comments from all you guys.
[03:06:59.565 --> 03:07:00.766]  I want to appreciate you on the show today.
[03:07:01.086 --> 03:07:04.669]  We're about to get in the car in a little while and drive up to the Governor's Mansion here in Atlanta.
[03:07:04.729 --> 03:07:05.649]  Crazy things happening.
[03:07:05.969 --> 03:07:06.710]  Who should start first?
[03:07:07.708 --> 03:07:08.648]  I'll start first.
[03:07:08.768 --> 03:07:09.489]  I'm high energy.
[03:07:09.569 --> 03:07:10.269]  I'm excited.
[03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:11.629]  I feel activated.
[03:07:11.829 --> 03:07:15.750]  We've been watching this happen for years and now we're making it happen.
[03:07:15.791 --> 03:07:17.691]  Now we're making history happen right now.
[03:07:17.871 --> 03:07:26.754]  And I don't think there's any better feeling than this unifying mindset that we're all working towards the same objective and we're all leaving it all on the line.
[03:07:26.874 --> 03:07:29.295]  And there's something kind of incredible about seeing that.
[03:07:29.715 --> 03:07:30.255]  And also,
[03:07:31.104 --> 03:07:33.366]  Our followers and fans are doing the same.
[03:07:33.446 --> 03:07:41.332]  It's a real unifying moment, people coming together in the great struggle that we all knew, I think we all knew was going to happen eventually.
[03:07:41.752 --> 03:07:46.015]  We've been watching them, the globalists are making their play, and now we're making our play too.
[03:07:46.095 --> 03:07:48.497]  It was their turn for a long time, and now it's our turn.
[03:07:48.557 --> 03:07:56.263]  So I'm feeling really good, but of course we gotta keep our foot on the gas and keep it going all the way through the inauguration, maybe even afterwards.
[03:07:56.323 --> 03:07:59.445]  But I think that this is maybe the best outcome that could have happened.
[03:07:59.565 --> 03:08:03.007]  We are really delegitimizing the system and we're galvanizing the people.
[03:08:04.368 --> 03:08:05.249]  I think this is great.
[03:08:05.709 --> 03:08:09.832]  I'm really, I'm emboldened by what I've seen today.
[03:08:10.132 --> 03:08:11.133]  The speeches were great.
[03:08:11.713 --> 03:08:14.956]  Now I understand Alex's voice because I actually lost mine screaming.
[03:08:15.356 --> 03:08:17.918]  I've never had that happen before, but now I understand the voice.
[03:08:18.965 --> 03:08:21.366]  But, you know, Nick motivated me, Ali motivated me.
[03:08:21.386 --> 03:08:22.126]  This is great.
[03:08:22.546 --> 03:08:28.107]  I think that the elite are going to lose, and they're going to lose because God is in charge.
[03:08:28.287 --> 03:08:29.668]  And we know the end of the story.
[03:08:29.708 --> 03:08:32.508]  We've been told, you know, in the scriptures what's going to happen.
[03:08:32.548 --> 03:08:36.529]  We know that the elite serving basically Satan, they're not going to win.
[03:08:37.189 --> 03:08:39.350]  We know that Christ has already pretty much won.
[03:08:40.050 --> 03:08:42.631]  And so now we're just waiting for that final victory.
[03:08:42.711 --> 03:08:44.031]  And so I'm not worried about
[03:08:44.691 --> 03:08:46.292]  Yeah, well you just stole my line.
[03:08:46.372 --> 03:08:48.432]  I was gonna say, you know, faith without works is dead.
[03:09:04.722 --> 03:09:09.583]  And so, you know, I love what Michelle Malkin said in Colorado Springs, I think a couple of weeks ago.
[03:09:10.023 --> 03:09:15.004]  What will you be able to say to the next generation of slaves that you did now?
[03:09:15.684 --> 03:09:18.185]  Will you say, oh, I had to keep my job.
[03:09:18.645 --> 03:09:22.406]  I was worried about tweeting or retweeting or posting something on Facebook.
[03:09:22.646 --> 03:09:23.906]  I couldn't have someone see my face.
[03:09:23.926 --> 03:09:25.126]  I'm worried about my safety.
[03:09:25.726 --> 03:09:27.307]  Do you guys have a wheelchair ramp?
[03:09:27.787 --> 03:09:29.727]  You have to fight back.
[03:09:29.767 --> 03:09:31.328]  You have to stop the steal.
[03:09:31.388 --> 03:09:32.048]  You're in action.
[03:09:32.088 --> 03:09:32.988]  Green-lit slavery.
[03:09:34.546 --> 03:09:35.186]  Exactly.
[03:09:35.586 --> 03:09:42.129]  It was incrementalism and inaction that gave us this false sense of decadence.
[03:09:42.429 --> 03:09:43.189]  And it's all a lie.
[03:09:43.469 --> 03:09:44.109]  It's all a lie.
[03:09:44.129 --> 03:09:46.730]  So we're all going to be prepared for whatever comes next.
[03:09:46.870 --> 03:09:50.772]  It's going to be not so hot, but it's better than slavery.
[03:09:51.012 --> 03:09:56.654]  So stop the steal to end the lockdowns or enjoy your pod and your Thai pod meals.
[03:09:57.227 --> 03:09:59.088]  That's right, we've still got quite a bit of time left here.
[03:09:59.869 --> 03:10:01.270]  What's coming up next tomorrow?
[03:10:02.250 --> 03:10:03.271]  What's the next big battle?
[03:10:03.291 --> 03:10:09.895]  First, you're the strategist, I know a little bit of strategy too, but what's the next big battle now that they've given this big press conference, they've put forward the evidence?
[03:10:10.315 --> 03:10:11.496]  We've got to put it in the courts.
[03:10:11.776 --> 03:10:16.979]  You know, I saw a quote where Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani said, we have time.
[03:10:17.340 --> 03:10:17.860]  My message...
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:27.309]  To them privately and I've said it publicly and I'll say it publicly again is do not underestimate that federal judges and even Supreme Court justices are still human.
[03:10:27.509 --> 03:10:29.491]  Which is why we will have protests in DC.
[03:10:29.791 --> 03:10:33.275]  When they're at the Supreme Court, I'll be at the Supreme Court.
[03:10:33.315 --> 03:10:34.216]  I know Nick will be there.
[03:10:34.656 --> 03:10:35.737]  I know we'll get Alex there.
[03:10:35.777 --> 03:10:36.718]  Maybe Jay will be there.
[03:10:36.938 --> 03:10:39.300]  But we'll be at the Supreme Court when they're at the Supreme Court.
[03:10:39.521 --> 03:10:42.624]  Do not underestimate that the system will try to protect itself.
[03:10:43.184 --> 03:10:46.186]  It's lies, it's feral, it's violent.
[03:10:46.226 --> 03:10:48.288]  Trump was an interloper, he came in from outside.
[03:10:48.368 --> 03:10:56.214]  Right, he came in from outside because remember, they do all this polling and media conditioning and programming to say, well what is a convincing lie?
[03:10:56.474 --> 03:11:01.218]  So when Trump came from behind it was because they didn't have access to his internal polling, he wasn't even doing that much.
[03:11:01.918 --> 03:11:05.339]  So, what we have to understand is, we've got to now break the entire system.
[03:11:05.359 --> 03:11:12.841]  You've got to cancel your Netflix, cancel your TV package, throw your TV on the side of the road and let everyone see that it's broken.
[03:11:13.021 --> 03:11:15.662]  We need great acts, great acts of humanity.
[03:11:15.702 --> 03:11:24.825]  Yeah, we need great acts of humanity right now so that we know that we are, Jay, we're 73 million, I actually think we're 80 million strong.
[03:11:25.105 --> 03:11:26.365]  They took away Trump's votes.
[03:11:26.586 --> 03:11:29.186]  If they took away Trump's votes, we're 80 million strong.
[03:11:29.386 --> 03:11:30.487]  This country is united.
[03:11:31.547 --> 03:11:34.910]  Yeah, I'll end with this, but the country's united and it's peaceful.
[03:11:35.370 --> 03:11:36.411]  They want us at war.
[03:11:36.651 --> 03:11:38.373]  And if they want one, we're going to give it to them.
[03:11:38.393 --> 03:11:40.154]  We're not going to do it to our fellow neighbors.
[03:11:40.374 --> 03:11:42.576]  So we've got to have great acts of unity.
[03:11:42.596 --> 03:11:43.077]  I totally agree.
[03:11:43.097 --> 03:11:44.158]  Closing comments from you guys.
[03:11:44.198 --> 03:11:44.398]  Go ahead.
[03:11:45.881 --> 03:11:48.623]  I agree with everything you just said, and that's exactly it.
[03:11:48.683 --> 03:11:53.446]  We have to follow this fight for as long as it's going on, whether it's in the courts or the state capitals.
[03:11:53.986 --> 03:11:55.687]  There's a lot of procedure ahead of us.
[03:11:56.148 --> 03:11:59.730]  The question at this point is what trajectory we're going to go along.
[03:11:59.770 --> 03:12:03.932]  There are many different routes, but it all has to have the same ultimate conclusion.
[03:12:04.172 --> 03:12:05.833]  No matter what, the playbook is the same.
[03:12:05.873 --> 03:12:06.174]  Resist!
[03:12:06.974 --> 03:12:07.454]  Exactly.
[03:12:07.555 --> 03:12:07.995]  Resist.
[03:12:08.175 --> 03:12:08.655]  Turn out.
[03:12:08.936 --> 03:12:10.317]  We have to file them everywhere.
[03:12:10.377 --> 03:12:13.019]  And you're exactly right that the system protects itself.
[03:12:13.399 --> 03:12:14.600]  That is the most critical thing.
[03:12:14.660 --> 03:12:19.304]  People have faith, I think implicitly, in the system, specifically in the courts.
[03:12:19.324 --> 03:12:23.087]  When the system becomes a cancer that wants to destroy you, it must be defeated.
[03:12:23.587 --> 03:12:23.807]  Yes.
[03:12:23.888 --> 03:12:28.112]  Specifically, the right keeps saying, the courts will save us, the Supreme Court.
[03:12:28.132 --> 03:12:28.833]  Let's do it all.
[03:12:29.173 --> 03:12:31.516]  Protests, courts, state legislature, everything.
[03:12:31.796 --> 03:12:38.764]  Well, and people think that because there is a judge presiding over a court, there's this idea that, well, a judge is impartial.
[03:12:38.804 --> 03:12:39.345]  No, it's all political.
[03:12:39.865 --> 03:12:40.746]  It is all political.
[03:12:41.006 --> 03:12:44.869]  And judges are just as political as congressmen, or governors, or anybody else.
[03:12:45.330 --> 03:12:45.790]  Exactly.
[03:12:45.970 --> 03:12:51.515]  Well, and even the Secretary of State in Georgia, as he's supposed to be above partisan politics.
[03:12:51.575 --> 03:12:52.556]  Totally controlled.
[03:12:52.816 --> 03:12:53.957]  And the Supreme Court, too.
[03:12:54.277 --> 03:13:03.886]  In Pennsylvania, partially we're in this mess because ACB sat out the ruling when it came to the rule change they made about extending the deadline for receiving the mail-in ballots.
[03:13:04.206 --> 03:13:04.966]  So, I don't know.
[03:13:05.006 --> 03:13:07.809]  We saw a lot of bad Supreme Court decisions come down this summer.
[03:13:08.349 --> 03:13:09.431]  We have to be out there.
[03:13:09.471 --> 03:13:10.512]  We have to occupy.
[03:13:10.532 --> 03:13:11.533]  It's not a given.
[03:13:11.773 --> 03:13:15.157]  When it comes to the left and left-wing causes, they're out no matter what.
[03:13:15.518 --> 03:13:16.759]  It's not a redundancy.
[03:13:17.079 --> 03:13:20.984]  And if we weren't out there at the state capitol, people wouldn't be out at the state capitol today.
[03:13:21.224 --> 03:13:22.085]  That's unbelievable.
[03:13:22.105 --> 03:13:22.345]  That's right.
[03:13:22.365 --> 03:13:23.587]  Leaders have to do it.
[03:13:24.067 --> 03:13:24.788]  One becomes five.
[03:13:24.848 --> 03:13:25.549]  Five becomes ten.
[03:13:25.589 --> 03:13:26.310]  Ten becomes a hundred.
[03:13:26.610 --> 03:13:27.852]  Ten becomes a thousand.
[03:13:27.912 --> 03:13:28.813]  It just goes on and on.
[03:13:29.093 --> 03:13:36.178]  We have to do it because the globalists think we're these programmable creatures that just do what we're told, and we have to be outside the box.
[03:13:36.859 --> 03:13:37.940]  Jay Dyer, we're almost out of time.
[03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:39.561]  What do you think about this historic moment right now?
[03:13:39.901 --> 03:13:40.862]  No, this is amazing.
[03:13:41.242 --> 03:13:56.534]  I would like to add that a lot of people come under the impression from being beaten down by the media, being beaten down in these brainwashing camps called schools, that you can't do anything, that you're worthless, you're guilty for who you are, for just existing, and it's all lies.
[03:13:57.174 --> 03:13:58.454]  You can take action.
[03:13:58.635 --> 03:14:00.275]  Everybody can make a difference.
[03:14:00.335 --> 03:14:04.836]  And it's not the case that just because you went through all this nonsense, you can't take it.
[03:14:04.916 --> 03:14:06.317]  You can't take action and change things.
[03:14:06.517 --> 03:14:09.938]  I think there's a there's a huge, there's a misuse of human potential.
[03:14:09.978 --> 03:14:11.298]  That's this new age nonsense.
[03:14:11.538 --> 03:14:13.079]  But there really is human potential.
[03:14:13.139 --> 03:14:17.480]  And if people get activated, motivated, take action, it won't.
[03:14:17.820 --> 03:14:19.720]  It's all about making us programmable.
[03:14:19.740 --> 03:14:20.981]  If we get outside the box, it's over.
[03:14:21.261 --> 03:14:21.421]  Right.
[03:14:23.556 --> 03:14:25.497]  It's true, and people can rise up.
[03:14:25.637 --> 03:14:27.137]  We have the power to do that.
[03:14:27.517 --> 03:14:32.539]  People think that because of the institutions that are against us, that we don't stand a chance.
[03:14:32.599 --> 03:14:33.740]  And Jay, you're exactly right.
[03:14:33.780 --> 03:14:35.800]  They lead us to believe that we have no power.
[03:14:36.120 --> 03:14:37.341]  The power is in our hands.
[03:14:37.401 --> 03:14:39.502]  It's up to us to break the mental shackles.
[03:14:39.522 --> 03:14:40.682]  I know this audience knows that.
[03:14:40.822 --> 03:14:45.544]  They just have to continue to stay engaged, knowing it's just going to get crazier from here.
[03:14:46.264 --> 03:14:49.386]  And everything you do in the future will only make you stronger resisting this.
[03:14:49.806 --> 03:14:52.068]  Those that give in to it are just grounded and destroyed.
[03:14:52.408 --> 03:14:54.849]  You're all going to become leaders in this fight as things become more intense.
[03:14:55.069 --> 03:14:55.289]  Ollie?
[03:14:56.730 --> 03:14:59.992]  Yeah, I mean, we keep passing and now I'm on my third closing.
[03:15:00.433 --> 03:15:03.274]  But, you know, you guys can be heroes.
[03:15:03.334 --> 03:15:04.435]  You guys can be heroes.
[03:15:04.475 --> 03:15:06.296]  The broken TV on the lawn.
[03:15:07.116 --> 03:15:10.639]  I canceled my Netflix and I'm proud of it because they fund pedophilia.
[03:15:10.779 --> 03:15:14.201]  The head pathologist in Canada testifies to government that
[03:15:14.801 --> 03:15:18.582]  The greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public is COVID-19.
[03:15:18.862 --> 03:15:21.764]  Just, these are good people saying, no, I'm not going to be a slave.
[03:15:21.804 --> 03:15:25.725]  And it's not that the virus is a hoax because they have weaponized something against us.
[03:15:26.005 --> 03:15:27.546]  It's that the mismanagement, right?
[03:15:27.746 --> 03:15:31.267]  If they're great central planners and they want us to walk into this new system.
[03:15:31.867 --> 03:15:34.068]  Can we trust someone who managed COVID this way?
[03:15:34.088 --> 03:15:35.769]  Or mismanaged COVID this way?
[03:15:35.809 --> 03:15:36.609]  Lied about it all?
[03:15:36.629 --> 03:15:37.249]  Exaggerated it?
[03:15:37.289 --> 03:15:40.651]  Yeah, so they can go to hell by themselves and without us.
[03:15:40.911 --> 03:15:43.492]  And our duty is to resist so that they wait another 15 years.
[03:15:43.532 --> 03:15:45.453]  Alright, so in about 15 minutes we're getting in the cars.
[03:15:45.953 --> 03:15:47.274]  We're going to the governor's mansion.
[03:15:47.294 --> 03:15:49.875]  People can look it up outside Atlanta on the edge of Atlanta.
[03:15:50.375 --> 03:15:51.575]  We're going to be there protesting him.
[03:15:51.876 --> 03:15:53.836]  And then I'll be at that protest tomorrow at 12 noon.
[03:15:53.876 --> 03:15:54.337]  I'll be there.
[03:15:54.357 --> 03:15:55.357]  High noon!
[03:15:55.537 --> 03:15:56.357]  High noon!
[03:15:56.457 --> 03:15:57.038]  Friday!
[03:15:57.058 --> 03:15:58.118]  I was there yesterday.
[03:15:58.138 --> 03:15:58.758]  He was there today.
[03:15:59.139 --> 03:15:59.719]  We'll be there.
[03:16:04.443 --> 03:16:05.783]  Anyway, so we're going to be there.
[03:16:05.803 --> 03:16:07.384]  It's going to be very, very exciting.
[03:16:07.404 --> 03:16:08.464]  I really appreciate you guys.
[03:16:08.484 --> 03:16:10.585]  I appreciate the crew, too, doing a great job.
[03:16:10.985 --> 03:16:14.266]  I appreciate all the affiliates carrying the broadcast and just everybody else.
[03:16:14.766 --> 03:16:16.447]  So it's quite a time to be alive.
[03:16:16.487 --> 03:16:17.847]  Real fast, we've got 30 seconds left.
[03:16:18.307 --> 03:16:19.408]  Everybody plug their website again.
[03:16:19.468 --> 03:16:21.488]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:16:21.528 --> 03:16:22.909]  That's how you bypass big tech.
[03:16:23.569 --> 03:16:26.270]  StopTheSteal.us, plug into the fight.
[03:16:27.170 --> 03:16:28.071]  NicholasChafewentus.com.
[03:16:29.801 --> 03:16:30.964]  JasonAlysis.com.
[03:16:30.984 --> 03:16:32.607]  You can find me on the social medias as well.
[03:16:32.848 --> 03:16:38.039]  And again folks, I know you know those URLs, but when you celebrate them and you promote them, it breaks the back of big tech.
[03:16:38.340 --> 03:16:40.404]  They want you to put everything you are up on their big platform.
[03:16:42.025 --> 03:16:44.307]  So they can censor it, so they can control it.
[03:16:44.867 --> 03:16:48.089]  It'd be like if you had five kids and they said, oh, just put your kids over here in this orphanage.
[03:16:48.470 --> 03:16:49.230]  They kill three of them.
[03:16:49.570 --> 03:16:50.991]  No, your kids are with you in your house.
[03:16:51.472 --> 03:16:57.816]  That's why we need URLs back to web surfing, back to millions of URLs that we all go to, that we check out, that we share.
[03:16:58.157 --> 03:17:02.200]  And then the social media network is our browser, not what they're trying to do.
[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:04.601]  So please support us financially too.
[03:17:04.641 --> 03:17:05.302]  Blow a lot of money.
[03:17:05.402 --> 03:17:07.163]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:07.203 --> 03:17:08.184]  Take action today.
[03:17:08.284 --> 03:17:10.866]  The War Room with Owen Schroeder comes up in T-minus two minutes.
[03:17:21.755 --> 03:17:24.937]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[03:17:25.217 --> 03:17:26.018]  Don't let them win.
[03:17:26.398 --> 03:17:31.201]  Go to our emergency election newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:17:31.461 --> 03:17:35.003]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[03:17:35.343 --> 03:17:37.644]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:17:37.844 --> 03:17:40.286]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[03:17:40.814 --> 03:17:50.118]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:17:50.958 --> 03:17:58.321]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:17:59.001 --> 03:18:05.324]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[03:18:06.164 --> 03:18:11.366]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:18:12.006 --> 03:18:30.253]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including Uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, Makaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[03:18:32.914 --> 03:18:44.879]  Two InfoWars best-selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[03:18:45.439 --> 03:18:51.462]  BioTree Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity in the cells in the body.
[03:18:51.482 --> 03:18:52.842]  That's every human activity.
[03:18:53.443 --> 03:18:57.524]  And on top of it, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Cucuminoid.
[03:18:59.005 --> 03:18:59.585]  We're good to go.
[03:19:19.898 --> 03:19:20.438]  That's right.
[03:19:47.501 --> 03:19:48.521]  America in crisis.
[03:19:48.721 --> 03:19:50.982]  Emergency Lockdown 2 is coming.
[03:19:51.142 --> 03:19:52.222]  Support Info Wars.
[03:19:52.342 --> 03:19:55.343]  The fight against total economic collapse and Biden-Marshall Law.
[03:19:55.383 --> 03:19:56.643]  This guy's is Lockdown 2.
[03:19:56.803 --> 03:19:57.784]  Up to 60% off.
[03:19:57.884 --> 03:20:00.664]  Plus free shipping and purple Patriot points on everything.
[03:20:00.724 --> 03:20:03.605]  And we got DNA Force Plus and Alpha Power back in stock.
[03:20:03.665 --> 03:20:04.585]  Bodies back in stock.
[03:20:04.645 --> 03:20:05.866]  Biotruce Lillium back in stock.
[03:20:05.966 --> 03:20:06.986]  Ultrathrone back in stock.
[03:20:07.026 --> 03:20:08.346]  Biotumor Fusion back in stock.
[03:20:08.386 --> 03:20:09.067]  Selling out quickly.
[03:20:09.127 --> 03:20:10.027]  I'm gonna say this right now.
[03:20:10.107 --> 03:20:11.427]  We called in Anthroplex.
[03:20:11.627 --> 03:20:13.768]  Super strong booster bodies.
[03:20:14.488 --> 03:20:18.349]  You know, natural test, boost all these things that's so good for your immunity.
[03:20:18.569 --> 03:20:20.149]  Nothing does that like boosting your test.
[03:20:21.030 --> 03:20:24.270]  It was a bestseller under Androplex, but somebody had a copyright.
[03:20:24.310 --> 03:20:24.951]  They threatened us.
[03:20:25.291 --> 03:20:26.571]  So I changed the name to Alpha Power.
[03:20:26.771 --> 03:20:28.391]  Super strong, super high quality.
[03:20:28.411 --> 03:20:29.452]  We haven't had this in a year.
[03:20:29.472 --> 03:20:33.493]  Because I waited, and then by the time COVID hit, we couldn't get it in, in the high quality version.
[03:20:33.613 --> 03:20:36.733]  It finally was available, and the company told us that we're getting the supply from.
[03:20:36.773 --> 03:20:38.054]  We may go out of business.
[03:20:38.914 --> 03:20:43.558]  Because of the total lockdown, you better put in a bigger order if you ever want to get it again.
[03:20:43.818 --> 03:20:44.999]  We may close in the new year.
[03:20:45.019 --> 03:20:47.121]  Now, why is this product special?
[03:20:47.181 --> 03:20:48.122]  What is in this?
[03:20:48.362 --> 03:20:48.923]  What does it do?
[03:20:48.983 --> 03:20:53.367]  Well, it's got a bunch of things in it, but it's got these proprietary ingredients.
[03:20:53.727 --> 03:21:03.415]  LJ-100, urecoma, long phalangia, organic maca, horny goat weed, tribulus fruit extract, rice grain concentrate, niacin, and zinc.
[03:21:03.475 --> 03:21:06.178]  By the way, we were putting zinc in this before we were putting zinc in things for cool.
[03:21:06.218 --> 03:21:06.578]  Zinc just
[03:21:06.878 --> 03:21:08.120]  Supercharges everything you do.
[03:21:08.140 --> 03:21:09.322]  It's got an organic zinc in it.
[03:21:09.422 --> 03:21:10.924]  It's back in stock.

[03:21:17.733 --> 03:21:18.354]  Sold out for months.
