[00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:16.268]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:17.493]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:18.156]  Today.
[00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:41.655]  We are live, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday, June 7th, 2020 transmission.
[00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:46.597]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we have a very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:56.259]  I came in yesterday and I spent four hours preparing and researching to put together the report that we're going to be airing coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.880]  That will take approximately a segment and a half to get through.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.681]  And then I am going to lay out
[00:01:05.413 --> 00:01:09.075]  For you, who is behind this cultural revolution?
[00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:13.156]  Who is behind this Maoist-style takeover?
[00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:17.398]  From the words of David Rockefeller himself in the New York Times.
[00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:22.940]  This whole thing is a Rockefeller-UN globalist experiment in China.
[00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:25.061]  They believe it's been successful.
[00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:26.662]  They're taking the planet over.
[00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:29.443]  And that is the ideology.
[00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:33.705]  That is what this entire system is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:51.869]  And so, if you want to know who wants to own you, who wants to run you, who controls this entire thing, we are going to be laying it out coming up here on the broadcast on this Sunday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:57.570]  Now, if you want to see the report we're about to air and share it, because that's how it gets legs, that's how we crush the enemy.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.663]  It's posted on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:02:04.363 --> 00:02:06.464]  And of course you'll be punished by Big Tech for sharing it.
[00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:07.304]  Screw them!
[00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:09.005]  They're a bunch of authoritarian trash.
[00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:10.106]  Share it by email.
[00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:11.426]  Share it by word of mouth.
[00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:13.407]  Share it by text messages while you still can.
[00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:15.428]  It's titled, Tucker Carlson is right.
[00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.150]  The Cultural Revolution has come to America.
[00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.192]  We're going to define it.
[00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:21.533]  We're going to lay it out.
[00:02:22.073 --> 00:02:24.655]  We're going to break down this system.
[00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:27.538]  We just posted the report about an hour ago.
[00:02:28.158 --> 00:02:29.520]  It's got 21,000 views.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.201]  It needs tens of millions of views.
[00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:40.689]  If you decide to get these critical messages out, the average American will know what they're facing and not be controlled by the globalists, and we are going to be able to defeat them.
[00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.652]  If everybody just sits there like armchair quarterbacks,
[00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:49.951]  They're going to overthrow the entire country, bankrupt it, and then bring you under full globalist control.
[00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.893]  So it's all coming up today.
[00:02:53.053 --> 00:02:59.357]  Also huge COVID-19 news where the German government, the British government, the Italian government, the U.S.
[00:02:59.397 --> 00:03:10.525]  government, all the internal documents are coming out that they know it's a complete total fraud, again run by the Rockefeller Foundation to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to bring in global government yet again directed out of China.
[00:03:12.073 --> 00:03:32.997]  We'll look at Antifa, we'll look at all the rioters, and how it's incredibly emblematic of how mindless they are, and how incredibly corrupt they are, and that their minions are so stupid, they attacked the black Civil War monument, the glory monument, and they attacked the black World War II monument,
[00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.296]  It's just incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:42.098]  But it's okay, they're saying the leftists can demonstrate, they can protest.
[00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.682]  But in leftist cities, the police will arrest you if you leave your house, still in many areas, or don't wear a mask or social distance.
[00:03:48.722 --> 00:03:54.164]  But if you're out ranting and raving and calling for an abolishment of local government, well, you're a wonderful angel cake.
[00:03:54.185 --> 00:04:00.228]  Because they have to overthrow government first to rebuild on it their nightmare New World Order system.
[00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:07.771]  So it's all coming up today on this Sunday, June 7th, 2020, worldwide transmission.
[00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:14.814]  The only way the broadcast gets out, whether you're listening to local stations or TV stations or whether you're listening on the internet or watching on the internet, is when you spread the word.
[00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:15.454]  You've been doing it.
[00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:18.876]  So because of you, we're still on air and still fighting back.
[00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:26.179]  But now it's more critical than ever that this information get out that has blueprinted the entire new order operation.
[00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.920]  This is how we defeat these monsters.
[00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:53.189]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and broadcasting worldwide with 148 days left until this incredible election.
[00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.250]  It is the final countdown.
[00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.450]  It is Sunday, June 7th.
[00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.150]  The year is 2020.
[00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.711]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.811 --> 00:05:01.831]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:11.493]  Well, the hypocrisy and the corruption of the Democratic Party and the big megacorporations that are setting up a medical tyranny has gone into overdrive.
[00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:22.108]  The United Nations World Health Organization, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, on record, and the Communist Chinese, is establishing world government.
[00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:35.519]  The Dabos Group just came out three days ago and said, we are establishing world government through the COVID-19 crisis, and the Global New Green Deal, and an end to capitalism as you know it.
[00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:42.201]  But it's all mega-billionaires and trillion-dollar companies that run slave camps in China that are quarterbacking it.
[00:05:42.382 --> 00:05:50.665]  They have hordes of dumbed-down idiots running around attacking the black World War II and the black Civil War memorials.
[00:05:51.565 --> 00:05:56.548]  Anything they see, they attack that's old, including their own rights.
[00:05:56.708 --> 00:06:00.471]  But again, it's communists that are leading the entire operation.
[00:06:00.511 --> 00:06:02.752]  This is incredibly dangerous.
[00:06:02.772 --> 00:06:08.796]  We're going to lay out the occult programming, the mind control, the classic manipulation.
[00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:15.060]  Now, this report I came in and put together yesterday and today with some of our great researchers.
[00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:20.698]  It's titled, Tucker Carlson is right, the cultural revolution has come to America.
[00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:28.529]  After we air this report, I'm going to define what the cultural revolution is, because the playbook being run
[00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:39.978]  By the globalists, by the chi-coms, by the multinational corporations, by all the big fortune 500 telling you America's bad, and the flag's bad, and white people are evil.
[00:06:40.418 --> 00:06:41.899]  What's the endgame in this?
[00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:47.584]  Well, it's all modeled off of Mao Zedong and his cultural revolution.
[00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:51.308]  And then, once they have that, they have the great leap forward.
[00:06:51.868 --> 00:06:53.830]  And that's you going to a work camp.
[00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.750]  Okay.
[00:06:55.111 --> 00:06:56.391]  And the total collapse of everything.
[00:06:56.431 --> 00:06:57.752]  So this is the blueprint.
[00:06:58.132 --> 00:06:59.213]  They're running the blueprint.
[00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:00.674]  The Rockefellers ran China.
[00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:01.474]  Still do.
[00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.575]  And Gates is their frontman.
[00:07:03.615 --> 00:07:05.196]  So here is the report.
[00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.117]  It'll take this segment and the next to finish it.
[00:07:07.918 --> 00:07:09.819]  After you watch it, research it, and share it.
[00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:12.200]  Because it's coffin nails to the New World Order.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.441]  It's kryptonite to them.
[00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.502]  It is deadly poison, this truth.
[00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.364]  So I suggest you spread it.
[00:07:18.424 --> 00:07:18.864]  Here it is.
[00:07:20.037 --> 00:07:24.661]  Every cult has the same goal, the utter submission of its members.
[00:07:25.122 --> 00:07:26.783]  Cult members surrender everything.
[00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:30.827]  They give up their physical freedom, where they can go, who they can see, how they can dress.
[00:07:31.407 --> 00:07:33.850]  But more than that, they give up control of their minds.
[00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.254]  Cult leaders determine what their followers are allowed to believe, even in their most private thoughts.
[00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:44.040]  In order to do this, cults separate people from all they have known before.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.565]  They force their members to renounce their former lives, their countries, their customs.
[00:07:49.106 --> 00:07:51.388]  They allow no loyalty except to the cult.
[00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:54.612]  The first thing they attack, always, is the family.
[00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:58.196]  Families are the main impediment to brainwashing and extremism.
[00:07:58.216 --> 00:07:59.277]  That's true in every culture.
[00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:10.045]  So if you're going to control individuals, if you're going to transform free people into compliant robots, the first thing you must do is separate them from the ones who love them most.
[00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:27.296]  Not just the United States of America, but the entire Western world is being turned into a giant open-air re-education camp.
[00:08:28.377 --> 00:08:29.498]  We are about to lay out
[00:08:30.828 --> 00:08:50.564]  Incredibly authoritarian, tyrannical developments taking place now, where in the EU and the United States, we're being told to adopt the policies of the Communist Chinese when it comes to allowing those that espouse the establishment view to march and demonstrate and have free speech.
[00:08:51.025 --> 00:08:59.572]  But those that do not have the establishment view of the UN, the Communist Chinese and mainstream media are not allowed to have speech.
[00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:01.734]  Churches are not allowed to open.
[00:09:02.155 --> 00:09:06.419]  Synagogues are not allowed to open, according to the blue states and blue cities.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:16.230]  But, we're told by those very same governors and mayors that if you're marching and demonstrating against police brutality, not only is it protected, it's something everyone should do.
[00:09:17.051 --> 00:09:24.420]  But those that are actually demonstrating to reopen the economy and for all Americans to have our free speech and rights should be crushed.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.765]  This is openly being promoted by so-called mainstream media.
[00:09:29.105 --> 00:09:31.568]  And this is the next level of oppression.
[00:09:31.748 --> 00:09:32.869]  This is not a new world.
[00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:37.354]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:45.890]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:53.754]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[00:09:54.875 --> 00:09:59.438]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[00:10:00.575 --> 00:10:02.896]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:10:03.076 --> 00:10:05.798]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:23.027]  When Rod Serling, himself, who fought in World War II against tyranny, wrote those words for the Obsolete Man episode in 1962, he gave newspaper interviews and said, I see this as a possible dystopic future, just like George Orwell saw a possible dystopic future.
[00:10:23.688 --> 00:10:28.771]  Well now, in the year 2020, we are seeing things that even surpass
[00:10:29.904 --> 00:10:30.566]  We're good.
[00:10:38.729 --> 00:10:40.130]  Obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.090]  A lie!
[00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.211]  No man is obsolete!
[00:10:43.491 --> 00:10:45.351]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:10:45.392 --> 00:10:48.273]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:10:48.613 --> 00:10:53.715]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:55.715]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:56.876]  A crawling insect!
[00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:01.358]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:11:01.898 --> 00:11:03.038]  I am a human being!
[00:11:03.398 --> 00:11:05.019]  How do you find, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:11:08.217 --> 00:11:08.677]  Absolute.
[00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:09.417]  Absolute.
[00:11:09.617 --> 00:11:10.157]  Absolute.
[00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:11.618]  Absolute.
[00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:12.498]  I concur.
[00:11:12.818 --> 00:11:28.282]  Authoritarian regimes always do the same thing over and over again, whether it was Mao, Stalin, Hitler, or Pol Pot, or thousands and thousands of years ago during the corrupt Roman Empire, emperors like Nero and Caligula.
[00:11:28.842 --> 00:11:29.642]  They decide
[00:11:30.342 --> 00:11:31.243]  Who is essential?
[00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:33.524]  They decide who is non-essential.
[00:11:33.924 --> 00:11:36.666]  They decide who is obsolete.
[00:11:37.507 --> 00:11:51.516]  And now, CNN and others are running breathlessly with headlines about how over a thousand health care professionals have come out and told the world that, hey, people protesting against the lockdown, they should be arrested.
[00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:59.862]  But everyone that's out there protesting against the police and calling for the police to be disbanded and abolished, well, they deserve their rights.
[00:12:00.642 --> 00:12:09.604]  So how is there going to be police to arrest all the people that go outside their homes and don't wear masks and who demonstrate for free speech?
[00:12:10.424 --> 00:12:14.764]  This, again, is a direct attack on common sense and knowledge.
[00:12:14.804 --> 00:12:16.925]  But this is what authoritarians always do.
[00:12:17.345 --> 00:12:25.506]  They always say that the inside group or the political group that supports the establishment has their speech, has their right to travel.
[00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:29.687]  But all of us that aren't, like the Jews in Nazi Germany, well,
[00:12:30.327 --> 00:12:31.168]  We're s*** out of luck.
[00:12:31.448 --> 00:12:50.319]  When you see fictional movies like Red Dawn that came out in the 1980s, where the Soviets and the Cubans take over part of the United States, and you see people in sports stadiums being told how much America sucks and being beaten into submission, you have to understand that that is taken from a model of what the Soviets did in Eastern Europe and what the Chinese did to their own people under communism.
[00:12:50.899 --> 00:12:58.344]  So now when you see America and Europe where people are being beat up for their race, where we're being told we're bad because we're white, we're being told America sucks,
[00:12:58.624 --> 00:12:59.964]  Take a knee for the American flag?
[00:13:00.305 --> 00:13:04.866]  This is all classical demoralization to make you hate your nation.
[00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:11.108]  Just as Antifa, funded by Soros, says, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:23.772]  All right, so when we come back, I'm gonna play the last eight minutes of this special report, but think about it.
[00:13:24.648 --> 00:13:35.214]  We could play 30 minutes of clips of cops beating up black people, white people, Hispanics, doesn't matter, for being out in public and not social distancing or not wearing a mask.
[00:13:36.295 --> 00:13:39.217]  When you show citizens attacking people, oh that was good though.
[00:13:40.816 --> 00:13:41.336]  No, it wasn't.
[00:13:41.996 --> 00:13:49.618]  Now when the cops wrongfully kill somebody and they all get indicted, the whole country melts down and then everybody's guilty for what some bad cops did.
[00:13:50.098 --> 00:13:54.300]  And the left says disarm and disband all the police?
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.180]  Well, who's going to go out and run all your leftist control systems?
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.661]  They're not getting rid of the police.
[00:13:59.161 --> 00:14:05.803]  The left are muscling in on the police and saying, you're going to be leftist enforcers now or we're going to cut your funding.
[00:14:06.043 --> 00:14:07.043]  That's all this is.
[00:14:08.254 --> 00:14:23.152]  Conservatives, Nationalists, Patriots, we try to have good police, we try to make sure they enforce the law, we try to get bad apples out, but we don't try to muscle in and say, we're going to kill you, we're going to attack you, we're going to defund you, we're going to say you're all demons unless you become SJW enforcers.
[00:14:23.532 --> 00:14:24.433]  That's what's happening.
[00:14:24.673 --> 00:14:27.417]  This is a globalist takeover by Soros of law enforcement.
[00:14:34.337 --> 00:14:34.938]  Welcome back.
[00:14:35.038 --> 00:14:36.358]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:14:36.578 --> 00:14:47.563]  So Soros, Bloomberg, other globalists are funding thousands of county DA races, Attorney General races.
[00:14:47.683 --> 00:14:49.104]  They're just taking over everywhere.
[00:14:49.124 --> 00:14:55.747]  And then they have them prosecute patriots and conservatives and try to put Republican governors in jail for no reason, like Rick Perry.
[00:14:57.083 --> 00:15:01.324]  And at the same time they fund Antifa to create the pressure on the ground.
[00:15:01.344 --> 00:15:01.944]  Here's the headlines.
[00:15:02.244 --> 00:15:06.265]  Why some people think Michael Bloomberg's donations have undercut democracy and local races.
[00:15:06.565 --> 00:15:07.205]  Time Magazine.
[00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:11.146]  Soros aims to transform the justice system by funding DA races.
[00:15:11.766 --> 00:15:15.427]  Why are George Soros liberal groups spending big to help decide who your DA is?
[00:15:15.787 --> 00:15:18.708]  They're taking over your local government.
[00:15:19.348 --> 00:15:21.909]  And the operating system at the bottom is communist.
[00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:26.030]  But they're billionaire, fascist, tax-exempt with money offshore.
[00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.700]  Here is the conclusion of the incredibly important report.
[00:15:30.522 --> 00:15:31.546]  Tucker Carlson's right.
[00:15:31.586 --> 00:15:33.291]  The Cultural Revolution has come to America.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.162]  We always thought they were lying, now we know for sure.
[00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:41.206]  Because today we have an open letter signed by more than 1,200 doctors, professionals, and public health officials.
[00:15:56.801 --> 00:16:06.091]  And it explains that the riots you're watching must be allowed while any other demonstration, like one you might participate in, must be suppressed.
[00:16:06.672 --> 00:16:13.439]  Quote, as public health advocates, would you not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission?
[00:16:13.699 --> 00:16:13.879]  Huh?
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:22.445]  But they clarified, this should not be confused with permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-at-home orders.
[00:16:23.206 --> 00:16:32.312]  Those actions not only oppose public health interventions, but they are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for black lives.
[00:16:32.552 --> 00:16:45.351]  Again, this is being pushed by the entire corporate media around the world that this group of brave doctors stepped forward and said, people out demonstrating against police brutality are not a COVID-19 danger.
[00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:48.675]  Hey, I say they have the right to protest and I think they should peacefully.
[00:16:49.116 --> 00:16:52.537]  But they're saying this doesn't cause a health problem magically.
[00:16:52.977 --> 00:16:59.359]  Again, that's suspending reality if you buy their earlier lie that COVID-19 is super deadly.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.741]  Cults always try to get their members to suspend logic and reason.
[00:17:04.901 --> 00:17:06.962]  If you're part of the leftist uprising, you're wonderful.
[00:17:07.502 --> 00:17:15.285]  But if you don't want to be locked in your house, well, then you should not be allowed to go out and protest if you believe in free speech for all.
[00:17:15.805 --> 00:17:17.206]  This is the authoritarian saying.
[00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:22.691]  If you join us and take up our policies of the overthrow of capitalism in America, you have your rights.
[00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:26.354]  If you don't go out and parrot what we say, you must be silenced.
[00:17:26.735 --> 00:17:35.442]  That's why synagogues in New York and in New Jersey are now putting up signs saying, we support George Floyd, we're an anti-police demonstration.
[00:17:35.903 --> 00:17:42.448]  So now the governors and mayors can't touch them because they've already said, if you go out and try to overthrow the government, you're a good guy.
[00:17:43.089 --> 00:17:48.171]  This is the essence of a suspension of common sense and true mass mind control.
[00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:54.914]  We were told the police were the best people on earth when they were arresting people for walking their dog or going to the beach.
[00:17:55.334 --> 00:17:58.195]  And we saw mayors all over the United States from L.A.
[00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:03.617]  to Chicago saying, tattle on your neighbors and get money because snitches are good.
[00:18:03.817 --> 00:18:05.518]  You know the old expression about snitches?
[00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:09.179]  Well, in this case, snitches get rewards.
[00:18:09.699 --> 00:18:13.240]  And you better not ever leave your house or we will arrest you!
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:21.143]  We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail.
[00:18:21.543 --> 00:18:26.805]  Oh, but then those very mayors go out and march, and governors in Michigan go out and march,
[00:18:27.345 --> 00:18:29.227]  I'm the public face of this city.
[00:18:29.607 --> 00:18:33.331]  I'm on national media, and I'm out in the public eye.
[00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:38.395]  And, you know, I'm a person who, I take my personal hygiene very seriously.
[00:18:38.415 --> 00:18:38.956]  You're essential.
[00:18:38.976 --> 00:18:39.416]  You're God.
[00:18:39.636 --> 00:18:43.020]  As I said, I felt like I needed to have a haircut.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.423]  I'm not able to do that myself, and so I got a haircut.
[00:18:47.504 --> 00:19:02.519]  And these are the same governors in New York, California, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that ordered nursing homes to take pneumonia and flu patients into them, then calling those deaths COVID-19 deaths and jacking up the numbers more than 50,000.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.482]  But the fraud gets even deeper.
[00:19:05.942 --> 00:19:15.325]  From day one it was Fauci and the NIH and Melinda Gates that were funding the Wuhan lab in bat coronaviruses that could jump into humans.
[00:19:15.465 --> 00:19:16.365]  That's now been admitted.
[00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:24.107]  So the very group that was funding where this supposed virus escaped are now the people in charge that tell us how to run our lives.
[00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:31.492]  And then it was Bill Gates' testing kits that created millions of false positives and his facilities were shut down by the FDA.
[00:19:31.992 --> 00:19:39.338]  Now the FDA has been shutting down some of his vaccine experimentation that skipped animal trials because people have been getting so incredibly sick.
[00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:50.543]  But remember, it was Bill Gates that funded in the UK and the US the fake models that showed 2.2 to 2.5 million dead Americans when it's only been 100,000.
[00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:57.927]  And again, they're using people that died of the flu, of gunshot wounds, of pneumonia in the COVID column.
[00:19:58.647 --> 00:20:02.650]  So even with all that fraud, it's only at a hundred and something thousand.
[00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:07.494]  That is 20 times lower than the models put out by Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:20:07.514 --> 00:20:09.396]  Bill and Melinda Gates went further.
[00:20:09.796 --> 00:20:19.965]  They funded a study saying hydroxychloroquine that puts zinc into the cells and blocks COVID-19 and all other major viruses, by the way, was a fraud and was killing people.
[00:20:20.445 --> 00:20:31.772]  Lancet has now thrown out the study saying all of it was a fraud and a lie and all other studies show hydroxychloroquine is incredible with almost a 100% cure rate.
[00:20:31.912 --> 00:20:34.553]  And let's not forget the really big issue.
[00:20:35.394 --> 00:20:37.115]  I mentioned it earlier but it's on record.
[00:20:37.835 --> 00:20:44.479]  Doctors in California, New York, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, the four blue states, that ordered
[00:20:46.494 --> 00:20:52.878]  Healthy COVID patients who had the virus or other pneumonias or other flus into the nursing home.
[00:20:53.659 --> 00:21:01.323]  Doctors told them the default position is you don't put sick patients in nursing homes because there'll be a high death rate from even a normal cold.
[00:21:01.724 --> 00:21:03.405]  But they needed the high death rate.
[00:21:03.865 --> 00:21:09.469]  That's why the NIH, that's actually controlled by Bill Gates, under Trump's nose, made those orders.
[00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:12.130]  Red states refused, saying that's insane.
[00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.170]  But four blue states took the U.N.
[00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.251]  directive from the W.H.O.
[00:21:17.511 --> 00:21:30.494]  through Fauci and engaged in the super crime of putting sick patients and healthy patients that had the viruses into the nursing homes, now accounting for more than half the deaths in the United States.
[00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:34.235]  Governor Whitmer didn't just send all those COVID patients to the nursing homes.
[00:21:35.236 --> 00:21:41.841]  She also is still telling folks they can't open their businesses or leave their homes, hoping to kill the economy to drive Trump from office.
[00:21:41.881 --> 00:21:42.682]  That's her admitted goal.
[00:21:43.062 --> 00:21:53.091]  But she's out marching in public again with Black Lives Matter, even though COVID-19 has higher death rates in black Americans, if you believe the official numbers.
[00:21:53.691 --> 00:22:00.717]  And it's the same thing for the Minneapolis mayor, who told the police to stand down, let everybody burn down the city.
[00:22:01.117 --> 00:22:04.240]  Now he wants the federal government to, quote, bail them out.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.484]  What he really wants is to keep that money for himself because it always goes back to power and money.
[00:22:10.164 --> 00:22:16.429]  And now the Davos Group that is openly promoting world government has come out and announced the Great Reset.
[00:22:16.969 --> 00:22:24.895]  And they openly say that COVID-19 is wonderful because it's going to shut down the world economy and cut our carbon and save the planet.
[00:22:25.455 --> 00:22:27.476]  But it's not COVID-19 that did that.
[00:22:27.897 --> 00:22:37.163]  It's the hoax of COVID-19 being used by the globalists to selectively shut down companies and industries and small businesses they don't control.
[00:22:37.784 --> 00:22:48.151]  It allows them to come in and engage in economic warfare and siege against institutions and groups that they don't control while allowing their organizations to flourish.
[00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:51.754]  And they admit it all in this new report they've put out.
[00:22:52.074 --> 00:22:54.236]  Freedom was never given to anybody.
[00:22:54.756 --> 00:22:56.137]  You've got to stand up for your rights.
[00:22:56.217 --> 00:22:57.218]  You've got to be informed.
[00:22:57.479 --> 00:22:58.780]  You've got to say no to tyrants.
[00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:01.121]  They're not hiding it anymore.
[00:23:02.062 --> 00:23:06.806]  And so it's up to all of us to decide whether we'll be free men and women or whether we're going to be slaves.
[00:23:07.667 --> 00:23:09.208]  The ball is in your court.
[00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:10.529]  That's right.
[00:23:10.569 --> 00:23:13.612]  And the report you just saw is at Band.Video.
[00:23:13.752 --> 00:23:14.372]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:14.953]  Please stay with us.
[00:23:30.652 --> 00:23:34.274]  We are live with 148 days out from the election.
[00:23:34.334 --> 00:23:39.758]  I am your host Alex Jones on this Sunday edition and wild horses could not drag me away.
[00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:50.265]  Does it mean I didn't take off four or five hours this morning with my children to go tubing on the San Marcos River and it was really amazing.
[00:23:51.366 --> 00:23:57.450]  Made me feel so sorry for the folks in blue cities and blue states still locked up inside their houses.
[00:23:58.954 --> 00:24:05.700]  Still wearing masks, still submitting, and Governor Newsom says you'll never go to the beach again, basically.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:17.149]  But meanwhile, they do send people with the flu and pneumonia to nursing homes in New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and California.
[00:24:17.169 --> 00:24:23.174]  And that's over half the total deaths in the nation just in those nursing homes.
[00:24:24.175 --> 00:24:25.176]  Just in the blue states.
[00:24:25.876 --> 00:24:26.176]  Wow!
[00:24:27.324 --> 00:24:30.446]  And people say, well that doesn't make any sense, that's totally psychotic.
[00:24:30.466 --> 00:24:33.268]  The doctors in all those states said, this is a death sentence, don't do it.
[00:24:33.528 --> 00:24:35.349]  They had to have death numbers.
[00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:43.333]  You put people that have a regular pneumonia, a regular flu in there, in with a bunch of old people, you're gonna kill them.
[00:24:43.373 --> 00:24:47.356]  Everybody knows you don't go see grandma when she's 85 if you've got the flu.
[00:24:49.926 --> 00:24:56.009]  But you see, cult leaders need to exercise their cult power to make sure you're going to submit.
[00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.811]  That's the nature of the psychology.
[00:24:59.572 --> 00:25:10.298]  Now, Fauci has come out and said, we wear the mask, even though studies show they're not effective, as a sign of respect for medical workers, because they're the new god we don't question.
[00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:14.080]  While they shoot their TikTok videos in their empty hospitals.
[00:25:16.087 --> 00:25:17.688]  I'm not saying all medical workers are bad.
[00:25:17.748 --> 00:25:20.850]  It's just one of the most dangerous areas in the world is medical systems.
[00:25:21.451 --> 00:25:25.694]  There's more deaths in this country than cancer and heart attacks from medical malpractice every year.
[00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:27.935]  The number one cause of death in the U.S.
[00:25:28.155 --> 00:25:29.676]  is medical malpractice.
[00:25:31.218 --> 00:25:34.560]  If you put all the different types of medical malpractice in one column, that's official.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.343]  You're at about half a million when you compute the three or four different types in together.
[00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:42.525]  That's more than the heart attacks and cancer.
[00:25:43.046 --> 00:25:44.187]  That's more than even opium.
[00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:45.644]  And fentanyl.
[00:25:46.124 --> 00:25:48.126]  I mean, it's King Daddy!
[00:25:48.566 --> 00:25:53.750]  Number one killers in the whole wide world is the medical system.
[00:25:54.411 --> 00:26:03.798]  Because they're doing tests and they're researching and they've got good doctors and bad doctors and bad nurses and good nurses and it's a serious situation.
[00:26:04.819 --> 00:26:08.642]  But they want, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:26:10.993 --> 00:26:13.454]  Medical liability protection for everything they do.
[00:26:13.814 --> 00:26:15.055]  The big corporations that own it.
[00:26:15.515 --> 00:26:16.555]  They want to make you dependent.
[00:26:17.515 --> 00:26:18.336]  It's the medical mafia.
[00:26:18.356 --> 00:26:27.419]  And in the Soviet Union, and in Maoist China, and definitely in Nazi Germany, boy, it was the medical doctors that led the Third Reich.
[00:26:27.439 --> 00:26:31.021]  You may have heard of the main medical officer of Hitler.
[00:26:31.441 --> 00:26:34.442]  His name was Joseph Mengele.
[00:26:35.402 --> 00:26:37.083]  The Angel of Death.
[00:26:38.575 --> 00:26:45.240]  And all the little medical experiments and things he did under funding that came out later in the Nuremberg trials.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:27:07.575]  He, of course, escaped to South America because he was allowed to because he was so embarrassing that he'd been working with the precursor of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Coal Springs Harbor facility in New York City with sponsored tests being funded by the U.S.
[00:27:07.615 --> 00:27:08.296]  Health Department.
[00:27:09.462 --> 00:27:10.482]  That was the Nuremberg defense.
[00:27:10.522 --> 00:27:14.823]  Officially, you can go to the whole Nuremberg defenses online, the Nazi defense, and it was true!
[00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:16.824]  They said we were following orders!
[00:27:17.464 --> 00:27:30.167]  See, Hitler was on the cover of Time Magazine twice, and he was on the cover of Gardening magazines because Hitler was set up and told to do all the things he did by leftists in America.
[00:27:30.727 --> 00:27:34.228]  He was a National Socialist, and then at the last minute, they double-crossed him.
[00:27:34.248 --> 00:27:35.568]  But that's the real history.
[00:27:35.768 --> 00:27:36.429]  Let's just pull back.
[00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:37.629]  The idiots
[00:27:39.215 --> 00:27:43.257]  That are in Antifa, funded by George Soros, an actual Nazi collaborator.
[00:27:43.337 --> 00:27:48.841]  The idiots that buy into communism and socialism and say they're the anti-fascist.
[00:27:49.121 --> 00:27:52.383]  They attacked Winston Churchill's statue today.
[00:27:53.023 --> 00:27:58.946]  Over 100,000 people were there spray-painting it saying he was racist and bad and that he was a fascist.
[00:27:59.487 --> 00:28:02.048]  But then, major newspapers here in the U.S.
[00:28:02.088 --> 00:28:06.651]  are calling Antifa anti-fascist on the anniversary of D-Day today.
[00:28:08.089 --> 00:28:15.333]  And liken them to people storming the beaches at Normandy that Winston Churchill commanded.
[00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:21.095]  But see, that's when you don't have history or logic, you are a complete and total moron.
[00:28:23.256 --> 00:28:24.317]  And here's the evidence of that.
[00:28:25.017 --> 00:28:31.180]  Rioters deface Glory Monument to black Civil War soldiers in Boston.
[00:28:32.921 --> 00:28:34.162]  That's the type of people
[00:28:35.367 --> 00:28:35.867]  that they have.
[00:28:53.226 --> 00:28:55.428]  Do black vets count?
[00:28:55.808 --> 00:28:56.168]  I don't know.
[00:28:56.228 --> 00:29:01.332]  Trump's got them from a 30% approval rating to a 87% approval rating in three years at the VA.
[00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:04.475]  But again, you don't care if we double the money to black colleges.
[00:29:04.495 --> 00:29:08.758]  You don't care if we actually directed $100 billion in the black community for actual jobs.
[00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:19.507]  Because George Soros and a bunch of white chicken-necked meth heads and college professors in black outfits told everybody that Trump was racist.
[00:29:19.647 --> 00:29:20.707]  Okay, okay, great.
[00:29:21.548 --> 00:29:23.709]  This is the real fascist, folks.
[00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:35.517]  They're the anti-free speech demons that are out there bragging that it's their job to attack anybody who tries to engage in pro-America, pro-freedom talk because what's their slogan?
[00:29:35.777 --> 00:29:38.759]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all!
[00:29:38.839 --> 00:29:44.222]  But when we come back, I'm going to show you the cult programming.
[00:29:44.262 --> 00:29:49.065]  Ladies and gentlemen, when you're told to kneel and bow, you're either doing it voluntarily because
[00:29:50.657 --> 00:29:52.879]  You're praying to God and you feel led to do it.
[00:29:53.941 --> 00:29:56.103]  Even churches don't say, ON YOUR KNEES!
[00:29:56.984 --> 00:29:59.186]  Some people put their hands up to God and bow their head.
[00:29:59.266 --> 00:30:00.067]  Others get on their knees.
[00:30:00.388 --> 00:30:04.933]  These are normal responses when you're opening yourself up to the universe and a connection to God.
[00:30:06.308 --> 00:30:17.916]  But watching the leftist all-virtue signal around the new religion of hating America, hating white people, hating capitalism, hating the police department, it's not because they want to get rid of America or rid of the money.
[00:30:18.476 --> 00:30:19.897]  They just want control of it.
[00:30:20.678 --> 00:30:21.778]  And they're the high priest of that.
[00:30:21.818 --> 00:30:28.783]  And the new religion, they admit, is called Liberation Theology, developed by the Ford, Carnegie, and Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:30:29.243 --> 00:30:33.927]  By 1951, it was operational in every major public college in the world.
[00:30:34.943 --> 00:30:37.645]  Just like it's all centralized now, the healthcare by the same group.
[00:30:38.846 --> 00:30:51.197]  And liberation theology teaches the religion of racism and the religion that white people are bad and the religion that minorities are the Christ figure persecuted and that you must bow to them as God.
[00:30:53.117 --> 00:31:08.740]  This has been extremely successful in areas of Latin America and other areas where you have minority white groups and then those communists come in and program the indigenous that they are God and that everyone must bow to them.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.180]  And this is an oversimplification.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.621]  There's many forms of the liberation theology, but that's what's going on.
[00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:18.602]  Oh, I almost forgot the Lincoln Memorial.
[00:31:20.247 --> 00:31:23.309]  Because he didn't launch the Civil War in slavery completely, that was part of it.
[00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.032]  But he certainly got killed for ending slavery.
[00:31:27.112 --> 00:31:31.274]  I mean, he got killed, shot in the back of the head, for ending slavery.
[00:31:33.236 --> 00:31:36.158]  And they deface that, saying he was a racist.
[00:31:36.518 --> 00:31:38.599]  Everybody's bad that's white, you see.
[00:31:38.779 --> 00:31:40.441]  There's never been a good white person.
[00:31:41.421 --> 00:31:42.382]  It doesn't matter.
[00:31:43.598 --> 00:31:46.940]  That this is the country of freedom where we invite everybody in.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.441]  As soon as they get here now, they're told, hate the white people.
[00:31:49.461 --> 00:31:50.182]  They're the bad guys.
[00:31:50.442 --> 00:31:53.484]  And the country, and the West, that ended slavery.
[00:31:53.524 --> 00:31:59.827]  Slavery still goes on in some areas of Africa and the Middle East, but by and large it was England that actually had a bunch of wars to end it.
[00:32:01.148 --> 00:32:03.529]  Part of their war with us was actually over trying to end it.
[00:32:03.869 --> 00:32:05.870]  The first Declaration of Independence almost banned it.
[00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:07.151]  The first Constitution almost didn't.
[00:32:07.391 --> 00:32:08.392]  But the South wouldn't let them.
[00:32:09.012 --> 00:32:09.833]  So what Lincoln did,
[00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.591]  Eighty years later, we're just in a continuation of all that.
[00:32:14.091 --> 00:32:15.452]  But again, I know history.
[00:32:15.872 --> 00:32:17.092]  The average leftist doesn't.
[00:32:17.432 --> 00:32:20.033]  They know white people are bad, especially if they're white.
[00:32:20.373 --> 00:32:22.074]  They go, white people don't get to talk?
[00:32:22.374 --> 00:32:26.875]  Our reporters all over the country have white women and white men walk over and they go, shut the hell up!
[00:32:27.096 --> 00:32:28.136]  Get out of here!
[00:32:28.656 --> 00:32:30.057]  You're an effing white male!
[00:32:30.157 --> 00:32:32.157]  What the hell are you doing here?
[00:32:33.098 --> 00:32:33.958]  You've seen the videos.
[00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:36.134]  They're in a cult.
[00:32:36.594 --> 00:32:38.335]  It's a CIA globalist cult.
[00:32:38.395 --> 00:32:39.356]  It's a leftist cult.
[00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:40.356]  It's all on record.
[00:32:40.437 --> 00:32:41.457]  It's all Saul Alinsky.
[00:32:41.497 --> 00:32:42.458]  It's all Cloward and Piven.
[00:32:42.658 --> 00:32:43.879]  I'm going to show it all to you.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.223]  When we come back, I've got all the documents, all the proof.
[00:32:49.483 --> 00:32:59.129]  In David Rockefeller's own words in 1976 when Mao Zedong died, pledging to bring this here and re-educate you and put you in a death camp if you don't submit.
[00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.991]  They will kill your ass!
[00:33:10.783 --> 00:33:19.487]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:21.147 --> 00:33:23.388]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:33:23.448 --> 00:33:25.429]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:25.809 --> 00:33:26.830]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:27.670]  So...
[00:33:30.882 --> 00:33:35.503]  What the media does, what Hollywood does, is try to create division.
[00:33:36.064 --> 00:33:48.247]  But then they act like, oh, they're bringing in all these rules, all these regulations, all this political correctness, to stop the very problem, the very scab that they keep picking at that they won't ever let heal.
[00:33:49.508 --> 00:33:57.370]  Because that's how they control people, and that's how they change the subject from how they're stealing all of our rights, how they're selling our jobs out, how they're spying on us,
[00:33:59.141 --> 00:34:01.201]  How big corporations are laundering drug money.
[00:34:01.482 --> 00:34:04.382]  How the big drug companies are pushing all these dangerous drugs on the public.
[00:34:05.122 --> 00:34:08.023]  Psychotropic drug use up 87% since the lockdown.
[00:34:08.783 --> 00:34:10.643]  How they're pushing these deadly vaccines on us.
[00:34:12.224 --> 00:34:22.166]  And so they establish these systems of cult-like surveillance.
[00:34:24.738 --> 00:34:38.544]  To then say, if you don't talk the way we want you to talk, act the way we want you to act, we're gonna penalize you, and we've got this big centralized internet social score grid, and if you don't submit, we're gonna fire you.
[00:34:40.245 --> 00:34:47.789]  And I've got a stack of articles here where a talk show host said, I believe all lives matter, fired, off mainline talk radio.
[00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:52.311]  People on Twitter come out and say, I believe all lives matter, suspended.
[00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:59.992]  Major football players, like Drew Brees, come out and say, hey, I don't like taking a knee during the American flag.
[00:35:00.452 --> 00:35:01.812]  My grandfathers were in World War II.
[00:35:01.853 --> 00:35:02.693]  I love American flag.
[00:35:03.253 --> 00:35:05.234]  Boom, he apologized, said I'm a bad person.
[00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:07.615]  That's a cult, folks.
[00:35:08.196 --> 00:35:23.884]  If somebody would have told you 20 years ago that they take knees in the NFL during the National Anthem, and that later if other players said, hey, I love America, I'm proud of the flag, I'm not going to take a knee, that they would be boycotted and lose sponsors.
[00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:26.103]  That's a cult.
[00:35:27.484 --> 00:35:30.946]  And then they tell you a virus is unproven to be deadly.
[00:35:31.286 --> 00:35:32.247]  You gotta wear these masks.
[00:35:32.287 --> 00:35:33.187]  You can't go outside.
[00:35:33.407 --> 00:35:36.449]  For the first time in history, they don't lock down the people that have the virus.
[00:35:36.729 --> 00:35:37.990]  They lock everybody down.
[00:35:39.991 --> 00:35:46.514]  And then it turns out that they say they're never gonna let us go out again until we accept the vaccines they've got for us.
[00:35:46.935 --> 00:35:51.977]  And then we find out the very people that released the virus out of Wuhan are the very people that are developing the vaccine.
[00:35:52.818 --> 00:35:54.959]  It's just unspeakably obvious.
[00:35:56.428 --> 00:35:57.769]  So this is cult programming.
[00:35:59.571 --> 00:36:12.002]  And they're now having religious-like services all over the United States, where people denounce their whiteness and say they're sorry, and actually hold their hands up and pray to black people.
[00:36:12.823 --> 00:36:15.245]  Now that doesn't actually help black people or anybody else.
[00:36:15.665 --> 00:36:18.748]  It's an obscene, bizarre form of pandering.
[00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:22.672]  But if you look at what the communists did to South Africa,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:30.564]  They had white people come out and denounce themselves and say they were bad and say that they deserve to have bad things happen to them.
[00:36:30.604 --> 00:36:35.928]  And well, now South Africa is completely collapsed and has the highest crime rate in Africa and is a nightmare.
[00:36:37.789 --> 00:36:39.510]  And the communists did this in China.
[00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:42.332]  And I'm going to cover this start of the next hour, show you the history of it.
[00:36:42.372 --> 00:36:46.915]  But let's look at what's currently happening because this is cult mind control.
[00:36:48.066 --> 00:36:53.430]  Democrat senators kneel during moment of silence for George Floyd.
[00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:58.933]  Let's go ahead and roll that footage.
[00:37:01.775 --> 00:37:03.376]  And again, it's silent for radio listeners.
[00:37:03.396 --> 00:37:16.105]  You have a moment of silence in the entrance to the Senate and five Democrat senator operatives got on their knees.
[00:37:18.078 --> 00:37:19.658]  And they're also wearing the mask.
[00:37:19.718 --> 00:37:28.500]  Again, it's all this cult programming image that you wear a mask over your face because you're bad, you're dirty, you're evil, you have to do what we say or you're not good.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:40.382]  Now you've got all these other globalist senators, white senators that wouldn't lift a finger for you, Democrat senators of the KKK party, and they're on their knees.
[00:37:42.103 --> 00:37:42.863]  But that's not enough.
[00:37:43.729 --> 00:37:48.312]  To have the military bow in Los Angeles or have police get on their knees.
[00:37:48.973 --> 00:37:51.355]  Now we'll play this with audio, this is incredible.
[00:37:51.775 --> 00:37:57.619]  Massachusetts police chief lies face down at urging of Black Lives Matter.
[00:37:57.879 --> 00:37:58.820]  That means Soros.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:37:59.941]  Protesters.
[00:38:00.401 --> 00:38:01.562]  Webster, Massachusetts.
[00:38:01.942 --> 00:38:02.703]  Michael Shaw.
[00:38:02.863 --> 00:38:06.365]  Now before we play this audio, listen to the praising.
[00:38:07.206 --> 00:38:09.428]  And they're saying, good job, Shaw!
[00:38:09.688 --> 00:38:10.589]  Good job, Michael!
[00:38:11.673 --> 00:38:14.734]  You didn't just bow, you got on your belly.
[00:38:16.575 --> 00:38:18.496]  People called the police on George Floyd.
[00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:21.797]  George Floyd had enough fentanyl in his body to kill two grown men.
[00:38:22.277 --> 00:38:24.318]  He dropped a baggie of it out on the side of the road.
[00:38:24.798 --> 00:38:30.941]  The cop put his knee on the guy's neck in a system that they're trained to do in Minnesota, in Minneapolis, St.
[00:38:30.981 --> 00:38:33.742]  Paul, turns out by the Israelis, strangely enough.
[00:38:34.889 --> 00:38:35.630]  Thank you, Chief!
[00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.370]  Thank you, Chief!
[00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.951]  Thank you, Chief!
[00:38:36.971 --> 00:38:37.351]  Thank you, Chief!
[00:39:01.785 --> 00:39:07.129]  It's not enough, but it's a start!
[00:39:07.169 --> 00:39:09.912]  Did you hear that?
[00:39:10.092 --> 00:39:13.114]  It's not enough, but it's a start.
[00:39:13.995 --> 00:39:18.999]  At these Black Lives Matter events, whites are told, you don't talk unless told to talk.
[00:39:19.279 --> 00:39:22.521]  You were there to serve black people because you were inherently bad.
[00:39:22.562 --> 00:39:26.725]  And Van Jones said, white people have a virus and are inherently bad.
[00:39:29.304 --> 00:39:31.145]  Again, the opposite of what Martin Luther King said.
[00:39:31.165 --> 00:39:35.007]  You judge people off what they stand for, what they do, their deeds.
[00:39:35.047 --> 00:39:35.767]  That's common sense.
[00:39:37.068 --> 00:39:38.209]  Martin Luther King didn't invent that.
[00:39:38.769 --> 00:39:39.569]  That's common sense.
[00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:47.493]  Jesus Christ said 2,000 years ago that you judge people by their soul, not by what class or group they came out of.
[00:39:47.513 --> 00:39:50.075]  And that was the whole point of the New Testament.
[00:39:50.315 --> 00:39:54.637]  No longer was it just the Jews that had the covenant with God for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:39:54.897 --> 00:39:56.398]  Christ came and said, everyone,
[00:39:58.007 --> 00:40:01.609]  is equal and unified in God's eyes if you ask for forgiveness of your sins.
[00:40:01.809 --> 00:40:04.771]  But you don't ask God for that now, whether you believe in God or not.
[00:40:05.031 --> 00:40:05.911]  Now it's the state.
[00:40:06.512 --> 00:40:08.333]  The leftists always want the state to be God.
[00:40:08.373 --> 00:40:17.678]  Sololensky said, and I'll show you his own writings coming up next hour, that he pledged himself to Lucifer, and that he believes the devil should reign here on Earth.
[00:40:20.819 --> 00:40:21.680]  So let's continue.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.141]  Here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:43.349]  This is the Minneapolis mayor, I want to play him actually first, Jacob Frye, bowing in front of the casket of George Floyd.
[00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:53.736]  He cried for a minute and a half, sobbing, completely fake, in a virtue signal in front of all these people.
[00:40:55.933 --> 00:40:59.195]  Just sobbing like it was his mother, or his father, or his baby child.
[00:41:02.276 --> 00:41:04.397]  This guy is a complete fake, a complete fraud.
[00:41:05.158 --> 00:41:10.821]  But it's all externalizing the university, externalizing the brainwashing, and expanding that out on the streets of America.
[00:41:12.045 --> 00:41:13.666]  Like, metastasizing cancer.
[00:41:14.187 --> 00:41:24.135]  Now here he is, yesterday, at an event where he said, I will not disband the entire police department, only part of it, because it's going to be his own leftist army, once he takes control of it.
[00:41:24.456 --> 00:41:28.179]  And so they booed him out, and said shame on him, and then chased him away.
[00:41:28.459 --> 00:41:32.082]  So here's his own brainwashed throng tearing him apart.
[00:41:32.362 --> 00:41:32.763]  Here it is.
[00:41:34.335 --> 00:41:36.396]  We don't want no more police.
[00:41:36.777 --> 00:41:38.017]  Is that clear?
[00:41:38.078 --> 00:41:44.842]  We don't want people with guns toting around in our community, shooting us down.
[00:41:44.862 --> 00:41:45.963]  You have an answer?
[00:41:46.043 --> 00:41:47.804]  It is a yes or a no.
[00:41:47.964 --> 00:41:49.785]  It is a yes or a no.
[00:41:49.885 --> 00:41:54.088]  Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department?
[00:41:54.108 --> 00:41:55.729]  All right, be quiet, y'all.
[00:41:55.809 --> 00:41:58.231]  Be quiet, because it's important that we actually hear this.
[00:41:58.291 --> 00:42:03.535]  It's important that we hear this, because if y'all don't know, he's up for re-election next year.
[00:42:06.316 --> 00:42:09.498]  If y'all don't know, he's up for re-election next year!
[00:42:10.479 --> 00:42:14.401]  And if he says no, guess what the f*** we gon' do next year?
[00:42:14.762 --> 00:42:26.269]  I do not support the total abolition of the police.
[00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:29.971]  I do not support the total abolition of the police.
[00:42:30.432 --> 00:42:31.472]  Because he's gonna control them.
[00:42:31.512 --> 00:42:32.473]  This is just a takeover.
[00:42:34.745 --> 00:42:35.827]  No, we want no police.
[00:42:36.408 --> 00:42:40.873]  You know, all these people call the police when they need something.
[00:42:40.893 --> 00:42:41.234]  Go home!
[00:42:41.314 --> 00:42:42.996]  Go home, Jacob!
[00:42:43.036 --> 00:42:43.457]  Go home!
[00:42:43.537 --> 00:42:44.017]  Go home, Jacob!
[00:42:44.057 --> 00:42:44.938]  Go home!
[00:42:45.059 --> 00:42:45.639]  Go home, Jacob!
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.884]  And this is the thing that the left does.
[00:42:51.141 --> 00:42:53.803]  I'll be at a restaurant and they'll walk over and they'll go, shame, shame, shame!
[00:42:53.843 --> 00:42:55.183]  Like, I care what they think.
[00:42:55.724 --> 00:42:56.824]  But see, they're all followers.
[00:42:56.864 --> 00:42:57.925]  This is the mind control.
[00:42:58.425 --> 00:42:59.766]  We're gonna go to break, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:59.786 --> 00:43:04.268]  Please remember, the only way we reach new people, when you're listening on local radio stations, is when you spread the word.
[00:43:04.328 --> 00:43:05.389]  Thank you so much for doing that.
[00:43:05.989 --> 00:43:07.430]  It's for your own future, my future.
[00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.751]  Your word of mouth is what gets around big tech censors.
[00:43:09.811 --> 00:43:11.132]  It's what breaks the back of the globalists.
[00:43:11.552 --> 00:43:13.774]  And your financial support at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:14.673 --> 00:43:16.374]  All at the same time, getting great products you need.
[00:43:16.734 --> 00:43:18.994]  The sale will end today, finally.
[00:43:19.295 --> 00:43:25.557]  The big flash sale, 60% off, all our best selling items will end today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:25.577 --> 00:43:27.998]  Take advantage of it with all the great products there.
[00:43:28.378 --> 00:43:38.381]  But whatever you do, join us next hour and tell friends and family to tune in because I'm going to expose who's behind Antifa and what their endgame is and what's going to happen if we don't stop them.
[00:43:38.801 --> 00:43:39.662]  This is life and death.
[00:43:39.902 --> 00:43:40.442]  Please stay with us.
[00:43:43.901 --> 00:43:50.144]  Now, you have to understand that this is psychological warfare.
[00:43:50.184 --> 00:43:51.164]  This is all crafted.
[00:43:52.105 --> 00:43:56.987]  This has all been laid out at the university level, the think tank level by high-level PhDs.
[00:43:58.768 --> 00:44:03.149]  That in the blue states, in the blue cities, these are open-air re-education camps.
[00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:11.533]  And the bureaucrats and mayors know exactly what they're doing, and they order their police chiefs and others to do this, to get on their bellies,
[00:44:16.275 --> 00:44:25.523]  Because that is to empower and encourage all the brainwashed idiots that are going to local community colleges that are being taught they are the new future leaders.
[00:44:25.924 --> 00:44:29.667]  So they will be encouraged to become more and more aggressive.
[00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:36.654]  As they will demand more and more power for their political ideology of communism.
[00:44:38.186 --> 00:44:41.288]  This is exactly what Mao Zedong did in Communist China.
[00:44:41.348 --> 00:44:43.890]  In the next segment, I'm going to lay out the history of that.
[00:44:43.910 --> 00:45:02.502]  And I'm going to point out to listeners that a lot of people think that, oh, that's just the idiot universities and that's just the throngs of communists.
[00:45:02.522 --> 00:45:03.323]  They don't have any power.
[00:45:03.343 --> 00:45:04.564]  I'll explain something again.
[00:45:06.917 --> 00:45:12.920]  Soros and all these billionaires fund communism and the breakup of the family and gun control and all the rest of it because it works.
[00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:20.745]  They're able to get control and dominate and totally enslave people and get rid of the middle class and have a giant underclass of slaves they control.
[00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:31.051]  And they have been able to take over almost every country on earth and they are taking over the governments by elections and law enforcement by elections.
[00:45:32.384 --> 00:45:43.507]  And they want to set a precedent to federally take over all sheriffs so that good sheriffs that are refusing to confiscate guns can have the very office of the sheriff removed.
[00:45:45.387 --> 00:45:51.489]  Just like they got diving boards removed in the 80s from every pool in this country.
[00:45:53.356 --> 00:45:54.117]  Because of liability.
[00:45:54.857 --> 00:46:04.684]  They're using liability for law enforcement to force it under the globalist umbrella and then KD bar the door, we're gonna have a real war and have to go to the Second Amendment.
[00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:07.286]  And that's why it's there, is the Second Amendment.
[00:46:07.586 --> 00:46:12.550]  They take our speech, they suppress us, they put their tyranny in, they're running over us.
[00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:18.073]  You got the only shatter glass in times of emergency, just like a fire axe.
[00:46:19.154 --> 00:46:22.857]  And don't worry folks, as long as you know how to use guns, you can always get guns.
[00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:25.732]  With a hammer or a knife.
[00:46:27.875 --> 00:46:35.364]  But just please understand that they train us like idiots to think there is a physical civil war to go out and target the idiots they get out there rioting.
[00:46:35.944 --> 00:46:36.926]  That's the cannon fodder.
[00:46:38.187 --> 00:46:42.052]  It is the people that have engineered this whole thing that are to blame.
[00:46:43.632 --> 00:46:57.836]  And they know exactly what they're doing, and they're metastasizing in the blue cities and blue states to hold the country hostage with COVID-19 hoax, to make everybody wear a mask, now to let their people go out and riot and say, well, if you're with us politically, you're allowed to go out and do whatever you want.
[00:46:58.596 --> 00:46:59.976]  But if you aren't, stay in your homes.
[00:47:01.037 --> 00:47:03.898]  And the media is saying, if you leave your homes, you're a white supremacist.
[00:47:07.378 --> 00:47:09.259]  If you don't do what we say, we'll call you racist.
[00:47:09.379 --> 00:47:12.460]  But if you want to come out and riot with us, oh, you're wonderful then.
[00:47:13.462 --> 00:47:15.864]  You go, that suspends logic, that doesn't make sense.
[00:47:16.324 --> 00:47:16.985]  That's a cult.
[00:47:17.545 --> 00:47:22.169]  Cults have you suspend logic on purpose because they're cults.
[00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.732]  Their whole aim is to get you to stand on your head if they say so.
[00:47:26.012 --> 00:47:28.034]  When they say jump, you say, how high?
[00:47:30.176 --> 00:47:31.277]  That's the whole point of this.
[00:47:31.317 --> 00:47:33.999]  So people say, this doesn't make sense, they'll never win.
[00:47:34.359 --> 00:47:34.960]  BS!
[00:47:37.462 --> 00:47:42.106]  If they can get us to just sit there and not fight them, and not say no to them,
[00:47:43.404 --> 00:47:52.412]  They win, and people just keep complying and complying and complying and complying and complying.
[00:47:52.932 --> 00:47:58.577]  And now, they are running the Mao Zedong playbook up the middle.
[00:47:58.597 --> 00:48:00.138]  In fact, I wanted to print the definition.
[00:48:00.158 --> 00:48:02.100]  I mean, I know what it is, but I want the exact one.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:10.087]  Will you guys print me real quick the definition of the cultural revolution in China?
[00:48:11.601 --> 00:48:13.202]  And then I want the great lead forward, please.
[00:48:13.683 --> 00:48:14.003]  Thank you.
[00:48:15.824 --> 00:48:18.206]  We'll come back on the other side and cover this.
[00:48:19.106 --> 00:48:20.027]  Then we'll look at the election.
[00:48:20.047 --> 00:48:20.868]  We'll look at the economy.
[00:48:20.888 --> 00:48:21.908]  We'll look at the fake polls.
[00:48:22.629 --> 00:48:25.771]  We'll look at so much more and some good news on a lot of fronts.
[00:48:26.772 --> 00:48:28.493]  It's the Sunday live transmission.
[00:48:28.993 --> 00:48:30.534]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[00:48:30.915 --> 00:48:34.978]  Let me just say, we've got an incredible crew of dedicated people who are the best ever.
[00:48:35.258 --> 00:48:37.399]  And they're just as important as I am to this broadcast.
[00:48:37.419 --> 00:48:39.681]  So I want to thank the great crew as well.
[00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:54.878]  It is the second hour of the Live Sunday Alexander Jones Broadcast.
[00:48:55.258 --> 00:48:55.798]  And I am he.
[00:49:13.843 --> 00:49:15.504]  And you are the future.
[00:49:15.684 --> 00:49:17.145]  You can be old, you can be young.
[00:49:17.946 --> 00:49:20.168]  You can be white, you can be black, you can be brown.
[00:49:20.888 --> 00:49:22.169]  But you've all got red blood.
[00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:25.251]  The globalists think you're idiots.
[00:49:26.652 --> 00:49:26.972]  I don't.
[00:49:27.433 --> 00:49:28.153]  I'm betting on you.
[00:49:28.213 --> 00:49:29.114]  I'm betting on humanity.
[00:49:30.975 --> 00:49:34.338]  Up at the academic level, they're talking about the post-human world and
[00:49:35.373 --> 00:49:41.055]  How they're bringing in a world government to carry that out, how they're gonna merge with Silicon, how they're taking control of human evolution.
[00:49:41.416 --> 00:49:43.396]  I mean, it's scary science fiction stuff.
[00:49:43.436 --> 00:49:49.859]  And now, I go to Drudge Reporter, I go to CNN, and it's like, this mouse is 80% human.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.181]  Or, oh, we're growing humanoids inside cows.
[00:49:54.261 --> 00:49:56.662]  Or, hey, we've got spider goats.
[00:49:57.062 --> 00:50:01.424]  Everything I told you 25 years ago that was in the academic papers is now public.
[00:50:04.662 --> 00:50:25.671]  It's been in the academic papers since 1961 that MIT developed a psychiatry division where they were going to have terminal computers that were central computers that we would have little data computers we plugged into that would then give us our directives and our
[00:50:27.166 --> 00:50:37.834]  And that that would be used to measure their commands to us to then be able to change the psychological manipulations being put out on radio and TV.
[00:50:39.276 --> 00:50:43.039]  And they described that as the Intergalactic Communications Network.
[00:50:43.059 --> 00:50:46.121]  It's actually called the Intergalactic.
[00:50:47.862 --> 00:50:51.025]  And it was done to bring in worldwide communism.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.601]  The Internet was not created to defeat the Russians in a nuclear war.
[00:50:54.861 --> 00:50:55.701]  That's BS.
[00:50:56.501 --> 00:50:58.602]  It's on record the history of the Internet.
[00:50:59.062 --> 00:51:00.042]  Anybody can look it up.
[00:51:01.443 --> 00:51:03.863]  1961 is when they declassified it.
[00:51:04.564 --> 00:51:06.204]  There it is, the Intergalactic Computer Network.
[00:51:06.284 --> 00:51:11.866]  So, this is a plan to end you and merge you with machines.
[00:51:13.726 --> 00:51:17.807]  By the 70s, they had a plan that was declassified in 2000, then reclassified.
[00:51:18.147 --> 00:51:19.868]  Federation of American Scientists released it.
[00:51:21.684 --> 00:51:35.032]  That to end war, we will finally, at birth, be put into a tank with wires in our brain, and we'll live out a virtual reality, and the heat from our bodies will power the planet, and power our own systems and the machines.
[00:51:35.813 --> 00:51:37.153]  You may have heard of that before.
[00:51:37.173 --> 00:51:39.335]  It's called the movie, The Matrix, that came out in 1999.
[00:51:42.477 --> 00:51:44.038]  That's Hollywood telling you the plan.
[00:51:44.338 --> 00:51:47.219]  Look, look, I'm not the crazy people coming up with this, okay?
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.380]  I'm just telling you.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.182]  And the crew's in there just typing in, as I say it, pulling it up.
[00:51:54.226 --> 00:51:55.807]  And by the way, these are not crazy people.
[00:51:55.907 --> 00:51:58.248]  They've got us halfway there, boys and girls.
[00:51:59.028 --> 00:52:00.409]  What do you think work from home is?
[00:52:00.429 --> 00:52:01.209]  You can't leave your house.
[00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:12.295]  They're going to use the threat of bio-attack, once they run down your immune systems enough with these tainted vaccines, to where you're going to be living in your house.
[00:52:12.455 --> 00:52:15.476]  And it's not going to be a good enough upgrade, wearing the VR goggles.
[00:52:15.536 --> 00:52:19.918]  It's going to go into your brain, PKD, wirehead, cyberpunk style.
[00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:22.480]  That's all this is.
[00:52:23.817 --> 00:52:35.867]  So now, what do you think about the Black Lives Matter Soros people who attacked the Civil War Black Soldier Memorial or the Lincoln Memorial or the World War II Memorial and called it Nazi?
[00:52:36.928 --> 00:52:40.030]  That's the type of dumb scum the commies have.
[00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:42.792]  That's what you paid for with your kid's college degree.
[00:52:44.113 --> 00:52:48.437]  That's what's going on from the community colleges to Harvard because it's a ruling class.
[00:52:51.325 --> 00:52:53.887]  They are sabotaging the minds of the people.
[00:52:54.728 --> 00:52:58.051]  They're using our openness in the West as our weakness to destroy us.
[00:52:58.291 --> 00:53:07.638]  They're bringing in giant third world populations with no education, and teaching them that white people are inherently bad, and that capitalism is bad, so no one has any hope.
[00:53:10.501 --> 00:53:15.165]  If you try to have a conversation with an Antifa person about this, they will break a bottle over your head.
[00:53:15.945 --> 00:53:17.527]  And it reminds me of Omega Man.
[00:53:19.673 --> 00:53:22.774]  Great allegory, a remake of The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price.
[00:53:23.274 --> 00:53:24.454]  Remade again with Will Smith.
[00:53:24.854 --> 00:53:25.414]  I am legend.
[00:53:28.275 --> 00:53:30.735]  And he finds the cure to the people that are basically undead.
[00:53:31.235 --> 00:53:32.856]  He's got the antibody, that's why he's still alive.
[00:53:33.156 --> 00:53:34.736]  He comes to him, he says, look, I want to save you.
[00:53:34.976 --> 00:53:36.796]  They said, dude, we don't want to be saved.
[00:53:36.936 --> 00:53:37.977]  They throw a spear through him.
[00:53:39.517 --> 00:53:40.637]  And that's the point we've reached.
[00:53:40.877 --> 00:53:42.217]  These folks don't want freedom.
[00:53:42.417 --> 00:53:43.138]  They don't want a future.
[00:53:43.418 --> 00:53:45.078]  They are in zombie mode.
[00:53:46.007 --> 00:53:54.218]  And the sooner you figure that out, and as soon as you figure out that Omega Man is an allegory to Antifa, is the sooner we got a shot at changing things.
[00:53:54.719 --> 00:53:56.261]  Everybody should go watch it tonight!
[00:54:02.093 --> 00:54:03.654]  Because that's what this is, folks.
[00:54:03.734 --> 00:54:05.315]  These people are spiritually dead.
[00:54:05.576 --> 00:54:07.397]  They're not physically undead.
[00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:08.918]  They are spiritually undead.
[00:54:09.398 --> 00:54:13.121]  Every Antifa person I know is a dyed-in-the-wool, blood-drinking Satanist.
[00:54:13.781 --> 00:54:15.403]  And I'd tell you this years ago, you'd laugh at me.
[00:54:15.723 --> 00:54:17.664]  I can play a five-minute compilation we've got.
[00:54:17.704 --> 00:54:18.925]  In fact, find it if you can.
[00:54:18.945 --> 00:54:19.686]  I forget the exact name.
[00:54:20.166 --> 00:54:23.487]  Where they worship abortion on national news and go, I killed my little girl.
[00:54:23.887 --> 00:54:24.907]  I wait till I'm nine months.
[00:54:24.947 --> 00:54:26.308]  I like to have a human sacrifice.
[00:54:26.868 --> 00:54:29.109]  Oh, my boyfriend has sex with me after.
[00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:31.109]  We love killing our children.
[00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:33.130]  And comics talking about it.
[00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:34.170]  All of them getting off on it.
[00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:35.571]  Because it's who they are.
[00:54:35.851 --> 00:54:37.371]  Go to a liberal event.
[00:54:37.611 --> 00:54:40.652]  They're devil-worshiping, godless trash.
[00:54:44.413 --> 00:54:44.874]  Go out!
[00:54:44.994 --> 00:54:45.494]  Talk to them!
[00:54:45.614 --> 00:54:46.074]  Speak to them!
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:54.461]  And their religion is worshiping the fall of the Republic.
[00:54:55.281 --> 00:54:57.182]  Their religion is destroying Christ.
[00:54:57.622 --> 00:54:59.662]  It's the French Revolution, the Jacobins.
[00:55:00.122 --> 00:55:01.542]  So now let me give you the documents.
[00:55:04.043 --> 00:55:05.703]  The devil always creates a counterfeit.
[00:55:05.783 --> 00:55:06.743]  We had our 1776.
[00:55:06.964 --> 00:55:09.124]  It was really about empowering humanity.
[00:55:09.724 --> 00:55:14.005]  It was the beginning of trying to create the new Renaissance and do all the things that hadn't been done yet.
[00:55:14.025 --> 00:55:19.026]  So you can look at the time and say, well, it wasn't done all perfectly then because we're imperfect, but it was the beginning of that.
[00:55:20.509 --> 00:55:28.385]  And George Washington wrote dozens of letters about the Jacobin, Adam Weishaupt Illuminati.
[00:55:30.165 --> 00:55:58.653]  That knew that we were launching a revolution against the corrupt Vatican at the time, and we were launching a revolution against the kings at that time, so they created a counterfeit not to overthrow the kings and then empower the people, but overthrow the kings and the church and set up an absolute rule with no families, everyone dumbed down, nine-day work weeks, look it up, total destruction, what George Orwell wrote about as the Thabian Socialists, which is the same group,
[00:55:59.741 --> 00:56:04.163]  Being trampled, trampling others, dehumanizing, a boot stomping on the human face forever.
[00:56:04.963 --> 00:56:06.004]  A cult of evil.
[00:56:08.205 --> 00:56:19.809]  And so the Jacobins that called themselves the left-hand path of Lucifer, a few years after our revolution was successful, they launched their revolution.
[00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:27.993]  Adam Weishaupt, right after we launch ours, launches his in 1776, but it takes him a decade to really get it going.
[00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:30.772]  But it's not a thing of empowering people.
[00:56:31.172 --> 00:56:38.721]  It is a power of mass murder, rape, killing children, drinking blood, just absolutely psychotic evil.
[00:56:39.742 --> 00:56:42.826]  That was known as the First Red Terror.
[00:56:44.076 --> 00:56:45.797]  The next Red Terror was V.I.
[00:56:45.857 --> 00:57:00.945]  Lenin and the very same Jacobin Illuminati funding groups sending in 100,000 British and U.S.-trained mercenaries, Russian-slash-Jewish immigrants, back into Russia to take it over, only take over Moscow,
[00:57:01.405 --> 00:57:09.008]  Cut off the electricity of the supply trains, took them a decade to get control of Russia, then they murdered 20-plus million people.
[00:57:09.529 --> 00:57:10.789]  Absolute Satanism.
[00:57:11.529 --> 00:57:14.711]  Lyndon was on record saying, I worship Satan, I want more blood.
[00:57:15.051 --> 00:57:18.192]  His secret police would come back and say, everyone's submitted, sir.
[00:57:18.632 --> 00:57:19.293]  Who do we kill?
[00:57:19.733 --> 00:57:20.693]  Kill half the town.
[00:57:21.394 --> 00:57:22.834]  Kill whoever has glasses.
[00:57:23.154 --> 00:57:24.535]  Kill whoever has an education.
[00:57:24.935 --> 00:57:26.116]  I WANT MORE BLOOD!
[00:57:26.356 --> 00:57:27.356]  SATAN DEMANDS IT!
[00:57:27.637 --> 00:57:29.077]  RED TEAR IS WHAT IT'S CALLED!
[00:57:29.277 --> 00:57:31.359]  AND IF YOU WON'T KILL HIM, I'LL HAVE YOU KILLED!
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:36.461]  That's what Anton LaVey wanted to look like, was V.I.
[00:57:36.481 --> 00:57:36.761]  Lenin.
[00:57:37.522 --> 00:57:38.883]  The real Satan, on Earth.
[00:57:39.943 --> 00:57:45.166]  So, you have to understand that Hillary Clinton and the Globalists, they're all part of this cult.
[00:57:45.406 --> 00:57:47.187]  Saul Alensky pledged himself to Lucifer.
[00:57:47.367 --> 00:57:49.328]  So let me show you these articles, we'll come back and I'll cover them.
[00:57:49.628 --> 00:57:50.729]  This is from Wikipedia.
[00:57:51.189 --> 00:57:52.570]  This is from the New York Times website.
[00:57:53.928 --> 00:57:55.708]  From a China traveler.
[00:57:56.509 --> 00:57:58.409]  There's another one he wrote, praise for Mao Zedong.
[00:57:58.429 --> 00:58:03.370]  This is David Rockefeller praising communist China, saying he wants to do this here.
[00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:06.871]  Mao killed 85 million of his own people.
[00:58:09.871 --> 00:58:16.253]  When we come back, I'm gonna explain what they did and how David Rockefeller directed the eating of children.
[00:58:16.773 --> 00:58:17.833]  This is the New York Times.
[00:58:18.817 --> 00:58:23.422]  Eating children in large pots, just like Conan the Barbarian.
[00:58:23.442 --> 00:58:26.846]  They go underneath the mountain and it's a big pot with all these people chopped up in it.
[00:58:27.126 --> 00:58:30.550]  They actually do that in China to this day as a sacrament.
[00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:31.991]  David Rockefeller taught them.
[00:58:33.092 --> 00:58:34.173]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[00:58:35.034 --> 00:58:36.456]  That's where this is going to end.
[00:58:36.476 --> 00:58:37.317]  They're going to eat you.
[00:58:57.392 --> 00:59:18.221]  So when you see all these admitted communist mayors, like the one in Minneapolis, being booed and yelled at and groveling and bowing and crying, and when you see police chiefs in Massachusetts laying on their bellies and saying they're scum, you see the military bowing to communists.
[00:59:20.251 --> 00:59:33.056]  This is being done by globalist psychological warfare experts that are in all these different blue city, blue state areas and have operatives in every agency and every corporate and ecclesiastical system.
[00:59:34.386 --> 00:59:35.227]  An academic system.
[00:59:36.047 --> 00:59:37.068]  Many areas they dominate.
[00:59:37.588 --> 00:59:44.152]  And so they're training the youth to explode and rise up and commit mass murder, burning, and death.
[00:59:44.833 --> 00:59:46.054]  Now this is an exact plan.
[00:59:46.814 --> 01:00:01.164]  The Cultural Revolution was called for by Mao Zedong, this is from Wikipedia, on May 1966 with the help of the Cultural Revolution Group, soon calling on young people to bombard the headquarters.
[01:00:02.722 --> 01:00:04.083]  To rebel is justified.
[01:00:05.004 --> 01:00:11.430]  And of course, Xi Jinping's own father, he had to renounce and take to the forced labor camp where he spent over a decade.
[01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:17.074]  And when his father got out, he would then spit on him on the street and say that his father was a piece of filth.
[01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:23.440]  Even though he'd been part of Mao's original revolution, Mao was jealous of him.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.583]  The point is they just turn a bunch of young people loose.
[01:00:27.802 --> 01:00:33.265]  A particularly low IQ ones, and just fire them up and just get them to go out there and go crazy.
[01:00:33.605 --> 01:00:44.451]  So when I would go out and cover Antifa 20 years ago, I'd be out protesting George W. Bush in a war or something, and they'd walk over and go, we're gonna kill you and we take over.
[01:00:44.851 --> 01:00:46.172]  And I'd go, oh, you want total power?
[01:00:46.212 --> 01:00:49.093]  And they'd go, yep, that's right.
[01:00:49.654 --> 01:00:52.295]  They believe they're gonna be higher ups in the system.
[01:00:52.595 --> 01:00:53.556]  The average Antifa
[01:00:55.299 --> 01:00:56.859]  It comes from a wealthy family, folks.
[01:00:57.319 --> 01:00:58.700]  They have low-level thugs under them.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.460]  But this is a plan.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.860]  This is serious business.
[01:01:03.581 --> 01:01:07.762]  So it's like training a dog to bite, training a dog to like the taste of blood.
[01:01:08.802 --> 01:01:18.864]  And if you read, just even mainline Wikipedia, which I don't always believe Wikipedia has little bibliographies of the Communist Party themselves, about how this is run, this is the cultural revolution.
[01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:27.147]  Of course, before that was the Great Leap Forward, trying to force all the farmers off the land, force them in the cities to starve to death, and vice versa.
[01:01:27.527 --> 01:01:29.989]  And then they did another Great Leap Forward after.
[01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:39.454]  But this was so dangerous and so out of control, it ended up having Mao Zedong removed from power as well, and his wife locked up in prison.
[01:01:39.914 --> 01:01:45.677]  So, this is the most dangerous radical form of communism, even in a communist regime.
[01:01:46.177 --> 01:01:48.379]  You add that with hundreds of millions of guns in America,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.681]  This is a recipe for total destruction, but the globalists don't care because they'll pick up the pieces.
[01:01:55.202 --> 01:01:58.823]  But the Great Leap Forward and the Kohl's Revolution, you should all read it.
[01:01:58.883 --> 01:02:00.463]  Now, here's David Rockefeller.
[01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:01.624]  This is from the New York Times.
[01:02:02.264 --> 01:02:03.664]  Actually have it public.
[01:02:03.744 --> 01:02:04.205]  It's available.
[01:02:04.605 --> 01:02:05.105]  Just type in.
[01:02:06.192 --> 01:02:09.556]  David Rockefeller's New York Times articles about Mao Zedong.
[01:02:09.876 --> 01:02:11.358]  There's two of them where he worships him.
[01:02:12.018 --> 01:02:20.347]  And this is one where he says, community of purpose, the greatest society, we can learn from this, we need to be like Chairman Mao, we need to live like this, he is our guru.
[01:02:20.367 --> 01:02:22.430]  You need to go read it for yourself.
[01:02:23.459 --> 01:02:41.874]  Now, the entire time, David Rockefeller's family have been over there setting this up, putting the Communists in power, and then they were instrumental with the CIA Director George Herbert Walker Bush in the early 1970s in making trade deals with them that would further build up Communist China at America's expense.
[01:02:42.514 --> 01:02:46.217]  And what did George W. Bush call himself?
[01:02:46.277 --> 01:02:49.240]  George Herbert Walker Bush called himself a Rockefeller Republican.
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:59.108]  So here is the New York Times archive, the father of the Chinese Revolution, a huge article praising Mao Zedong, who killed at least four times what Hitler did.
[01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:02.652]  Continuing, here's the New York Times.
[01:03:02.732 --> 01:03:05.094]  Now I use this because the left sees them as God.
[01:03:05.455 --> 01:03:07.177]  They're quite proud of this, actually.
[01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:11.221]  This is 1993, a tale of Red Guards and cannibalism.
[01:03:12.642 --> 01:03:14.264]  But again, this was all set up and trained
[01:03:15.523 --> 01:03:20.007]  By communists out of the United States and Russia with Rockefeller and Armand Hammer funding.
[01:03:20.447 --> 01:03:21.828]  Carnegie, Ford, they all funded it.
[01:03:23.209 --> 01:03:25.331]  A tale of red guards and cannibals.
[01:03:25.571 --> 01:03:28.073]  And it goes in, here's AFP, French news agency.
[01:03:28.674 --> 01:03:33.638]  Flesh banquets of China's cultural revolution remain unspoken 50 years on.
[01:03:34.599 --> 01:03:38.542]  Where they would take whole families, chop them up, put them in large cooking bowls.
[01:03:41.448 --> 01:03:44.411]  And if you were enthusiastic about this, you would be advanced.
[01:03:44.471 --> 01:03:47.053]  The young people, of course, really loved it during the Cultural Revolution.
[01:03:49.135 --> 01:03:50.797]  You know, that's why it looks like teenagers.
[01:03:51.557 --> 01:03:57.263]  The average age of the Malice Youth Brigade was led by college students, but was actually 12 years old.
[01:03:58.244 --> 01:04:03.128]  And that's why you see what looks like 12, 14-year-old children here coming to eat you.
[01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:06.792]  That's why I said, you're going to love the collapse of civilization, folks.
[01:04:07.665 --> 01:04:16.492]  I made the joke, I'll eat my neighbors, a Jonathan Swift allegory, but then I went on to expose the fact that during a collapse like this, you'll be forced to eat folks, but it turns out they didn't need to eat people.
[01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:19.134]  The party just liked carrying it out.
[01:04:19.174 --> 01:04:19.594]  There you go.
[01:04:20.055 --> 01:04:23.257]  Flesh banquets of China's cultural revolution remain unspoken.
[01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:24.038]  50 years later.
[01:04:24.298 --> 01:04:25.299]  And look, how old?
[01:04:25.819 --> 01:04:27.360]  I said the average age was like 14.
[01:04:27.741 --> 01:04:28.121]  Look it up.
[01:04:28.601 --> 01:04:29.022]  Look at this.
[01:04:29.462 --> 01:04:30.723]  Look at that child right there.
[01:04:31.884 --> 01:04:32.604]  Second from the back.
[01:04:32.644 --> 01:04:34.386]  Looks like he's 10 years old, maybe.
[01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:34.986]  Maybe 9?
[01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:39.753]  Little girls, little boys, coming to burn your house down, coming to kill you.
[01:04:40.173 --> 01:04:40.253]  Oh!
[01:04:40.474 --> 01:04:42.395]  In fact, they killed Gigi Ping's older sister!
[01:04:42.856 --> 01:04:43.597]  Beat her to death!
[01:04:43.857 --> 01:04:44.738]  Beat her brains out!
[01:04:45.038 --> 01:04:46.699]  Gigi Ping denounced her!
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.881]  She said she deserved to die!
[01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:53.669]  Yeah, yeah, 16 year old sister when he was 10 years old.
[01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:54.029]  Look it up.
[01:04:54.330 --> 01:05:02.334]  And his father was sent to forced labor and Xi Jinping spit on his father in the street when he was let out of prison because they made them humiliate themselves.
[01:05:02.394 --> 01:05:03.475]  Get on their bellies!
[01:05:03.795 --> 01:05:04.815]  Get on their knees!
[01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:06.476]  They made them wear dunce hats.
[01:05:06.956 --> 01:05:09.278]  Actual dunce hats in communist China.
[01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:14.341]  Because David Rockefeller sent over sick psychiatrists from the United States and Europe.
[01:05:14.921 --> 01:05:16.602]  Dirty, horrible Satanists.
[01:05:17.679 --> 01:05:19.561]  To teach the Chinese how to do this.
[01:05:20.101 --> 01:05:29.730]  And now, in the space of two weeks, we've gone from nodding, to bowing, to kneeling, to laying on your belly.
[01:05:31.972 --> 01:05:35.316]  Lying on your belly in submission.
[01:05:38.462 --> 01:05:39.583]  Let me continue here.
[01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:41.684]  Struggle session.
[01:05:42.224 --> 01:05:52.550]  A struggle session was a form of public humiliation and torture that was used by the Communist Party of China at various times in Mao era, particularly years before and after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
[01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:57.814]  It goes into youth groups, making their parents and others say they were bad and get on their knees.
[01:05:59.294 --> 01:06:01.156]  But after that happened, the beating started.
[01:06:01.456 --> 01:06:03.037]  See, once you've said you're bad,
[01:06:04.608 --> 01:06:15.335]  Let's play that clip as we go to break from Massachusetts with the police chief, and you hear the Black Lives Matter Satanist leader saying, it's a good start, but it's not enough.
[01:06:15.395 --> 01:06:16.135]  It's never enough.
[01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:23.720]  So now the police chief's on his belly to the idiot Black Lives Matter guy funded by Soros, the true Nazi collaborator.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.060]  Here it is.
[01:06:32.345 --> 01:06:34.606]  It's not enough, but it's a start!
[01:06:34.666 --> 01:06:37.187]  It's not enough, but it's a start.
[01:06:37.567 --> 01:06:39.328]  I got good news for all these fat people.
[01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:46.330]  If you're successful, all these fat college students bringing America down, you're not just going to be skinny, your ass is dead.
[01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:59.095]  If you think a communist takeover is going to let you guys all sit around and burn stuff and be fatter than an elephant, the communists are going to kill you first because you're the idiots that raised up the drawbridge.
[01:06:59.135 --> 01:07:00.135]  By the way, that happened everywhere.
[01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:06.334]  So, oh, by the way, when Mao died, they killed him and his wife was put in prison.
[01:07:06.615 --> 01:07:08.956]  You know what happened to a bunch of people that were part of the Cultural Revolution?
[01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:10.117]  Most of them got killed.
[01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:15.361]  Only the few like Xi Jinping that spit on his father went to the very top.
[01:07:15.701 --> 01:07:16.241]  Well, guess what?
[01:07:16.401 --> 01:07:18.183]  I'm not spitting on anybody.
[01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.285]  And I'm not spitting on my father or America or the American flag.
[01:07:21.485 --> 01:07:24.427]  And if you want me to be your slave, I'm gonna fight you to the death!
[01:07:24.587 --> 01:07:25.448]  You understand that?
[01:07:33.931 --> 01:07:34.812]  I certainly can.
[01:07:34.832 --> 01:07:42.058]  Monday through Friday.
[01:07:50.742 --> 01:07:51.502]  From 11 a.m.
[01:07:51.522 --> 01:07:52.202]  to 3 p.m.
[01:07:52.222 --> 01:07:52.743]  you can hear it.
[01:07:52.763 --> 01:07:54.803]  The broadcasting won't stop.
[01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:56.064]  The Info War.
[01:07:56.584 --> 01:07:57.624]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:07:58.004 --> 01:07:59.365]  David Knight, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:07:59.765 --> 01:08:01.666]  Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[01:08:01.686 --> 01:08:02.306]  of the War Room.
[01:08:02.326 --> 01:08:10.529]  We've got that specialty show we're running for a while throughout the election, and that, of course, is with Robert Barnes, American Countdown, seven to nine weeknights.
[01:08:11.189 --> 01:08:19.112]  Only way the dog hunts is you share the link, Band.Video, InfoWars.com, and tell folks with local radio and TV stations to pick up the transmissions.
[01:08:19.952 --> 01:08:20.232]  Okay.
[01:08:22.543 --> 01:08:29.067]  I'm not up here trying to tell you a bunch of macabre, scary stuff so that you get the willies when you're sitting around a campfire.
[01:08:29.467 --> 01:08:36.972]  These aren't stories about, oh, this campsite was on an Indian burial mound and I woke up one night in the full moon and saw the big chief out there and it scared me.
[01:08:37.352 --> 01:08:38.433]  This isn't stuff like this.
[01:08:39.313 --> 01:08:42.836]  Mao Zedong killed 85 million people, the Chinese communists say.
[01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:49.840]  They've killed another, what is it, 25 million or so since then.
[01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:56.086]  Think about those numbers.
[01:08:58.247 --> 01:09:03.288]  And think about why Stalin said one man dies in tragedy, 10,000 dies in statistics.
[01:09:03.588 --> 01:09:08.469]  We're all told to care about George Floyd, and I don't like watching a cop sit there with his knee on somebody's neck.
[01:09:08.889 --> 01:09:14.890]  You know, last night, I was sitting there with my wife and the Netflix, and she said, you know, stay up late, let's watch a movie.
[01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:18.431]  So I said, okay, have you watched Starship Troopers?
[01:09:18.451 --> 01:09:19.171]  And she's like, no.
[01:09:19.231 --> 01:09:23.012]  I go, well, that's a Robert A. Heinlein book, and it remade the movie in the 90s.
[01:09:23.432 --> 01:09:23.952]  It's excellent.
[01:09:25.219 --> 01:09:30.841]  And they go to boot camp, and the sergeant puts his knee on the lady's neck to make her pass out, teaching them that move.
[01:09:31.181 --> 01:09:32.821]  And that is a military move to do that.
[01:09:33.361 --> 01:09:37.383]  And he puts it on one side of her neck, pushes the neck over, and then shuts down the other carotid artery.
[01:09:38.703 --> 01:09:42.544]  They teach them to do that at the Minneapolis-St.
[01:09:42.584 --> 01:09:45.865]  Paul Police Department, one of only 10 departments we know of that do it.
[01:09:46.425 --> 01:09:48.446]  A caller called and told me about that, and I looked it up.
[01:09:48.466 --> 01:09:49.066]  It's actually true.
[01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:53.833]  And again, that's a military tactic.
[01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:55.154]  Why was that being done?
[01:09:55.554 --> 01:09:55.834]  Okay.
[01:09:56.195 --> 01:09:56.955]  Shouldn't be done.
[01:09:57.436 --> 01:09:57.636]  Yeah.
[01:09:57.696 --> 01:09:59.618]  That's the, that's the actress, the redhead actress.
[01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:04.062]  I don't know why he likes Denise Richards in this movie and not the other redhead.
[01:10:04.943 --> 01:10:16.453]  But, uh, the point is, is that who knows if you guys can pull up the clip where woman choked out by drill Sergeant
[01:10:19.457 --> 01:10:21.258]  Starship Troopers, but if you can't find it, it doesn't matter.
[01:10:21.998 --> 01:10:22.618]  I'm digressing.
[01:10:22.658 --> 01:10:24.839]  Let's just move on.
[01:10:24.879 --> 01:10:28.080]  There's 350 million people, probably 360 million in this country.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:31.061]  There's, you know, there's 335 million, but there's a lot of illegal aliens.
[01:10:34.142 --> 01:10:39.864]  And we're told cops know that he's on video and he's putting his knee on the guy's head.
[01:10:40.864 --> 01:10:45.726]  We're going to find out if he premeditatedly murdered him or he was trained to do that, which we know.
[01:10:46.186 --> 01:10:48.147]  And then there will quote won't be justice.
[01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:54.599]  And when there's not that justice, yeah this is a scene right here, coming up in a few minutes.
[01:10:55.079 --> 01:10:58.240]  When there's not that justice, there's going to be more burning.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:02.541]  But that's how it works in trials in America, in a quote, free country compared to China.
[01:11:02.761 --> 01:11:06.742]  In China, the communists just say you're guilty, and a group of 14 year olds gouges your eyeballs out.
[01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:19.666]  Here, if you get taken to court, and he goes, I was trained to do this, and they get the witnesses up there that he was trained to do it, he's going to not get
[01:11:20.891 --> 01:11:23.213]  In prison, because they did too big a charge.
[01:11:24.954 --> 01:11:27.676]  If they said he did it wrong, it was manslaughter, they might be able to get him.
[01:11:28.257 --> 01:11:32.580]  Because it's better that ten guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison.
[01:11:32.981 --> 01:11:34.142]  Remember all that, folks?
[01:11:34.222 --> 01:11:35.182]  Remember due process?
[01:11:35.323 --> 01:11:38.945]  I don't give a rat's butt about that random cop.
[01:11:40.307 --> 01:11:42.749]  It's not about, oh, I want the white guy to be able to kill a black guy.
[01:11:43.209 --> 01:11:47.913]  It's about the reality, ladies and gentlemen, that leftist departments
[01:11:49.198 --> 01:11:52.681]  Are some of the worst run departments in this country, and everybody knows that.
[01:11:52.881 --> 01:11:54.683]  Hey, who wants to live in a blue city?
[01:11:56.404 --> 01:11:59.187]  Who wants to live where the bureaucracy is in charge?
[01:11:59.467 --> 01:11:59.987]  Nobody.
[01:12:00.348 --> 01:12:02.530]  Everybody knows Democrats run things where?
[01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.691]  Into the toilet.
[01:12:05.993 --> 01:12:09.976]  They don't just run things into the ground.
[01:12:12.098 --> 01:12:13.299]  Let me get back on what I was saying.
[01:12:15.959 --> 01:12:20.863]  If you haven't read Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky, I hadn't read it in about 20 years.
[01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:22.324]  I read it again about six months ago.
[01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:25.006]  And I got really pissed reading it.
[01:12:25.046 --> 01:12:25.667]  It's a short book.
[01:12:26.988 --> 01:12:36.115]  Because everything he talks about in that, and this was an admitted devil worshiper, that hated America, hated God, a Jacobin, Illuminati, French Revolution follower.
[01:12:36.416 --> 01:12:43.722]  Again, French Revolution was satanic, run by the Jacobins to overthrow civilization and set up a total tyranny.
[01:12:44.282 --> 01:12:45.263]  Not our revolution.
[01:12:46.966 --> 01:12:58.552]  And then, the next extension was the Soviet takeover, the Bolshevik Revolution 1917, and then the exploitation of Russia into the world to take over that ideology, quote, of the people.
[01:12:59.052 --> 01:13:08.537]  But really, it was total enslavement and total death run by ultra-rich robber barons, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Carnegies, the Fords.
[01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:12.439]  Those endowments all bankrolled the Communists.
[01:13:13.939 --> 01:13:14.600]  That's all it is.
[01:13:15.768 --> 01:13:24.316]  And in the dialectic then they could build up a huge police state here and a huge military here and centralized power here to fight the evil they had just created.
[01:13:26.539 --> 01:13:29.461]  And then through the dialectic that is in State Department Memorandum 7277.
[01:13:30.302 --> 01:13:33.585]  Guys, please bring up State Department Memorandum 7277.
[01:13:33.866 --> 01:13:36.788]  Just type it in, click images, and you'll see the UN Manual.
[01:13:38.882 --> 01:13:45.127]  1962 that shows disarming the military, disarming the police, disarming the citizens.
[01:13:45.427 --> 01:13:48.269]  And it shows the citizens with their guns going down to zero.
[01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:50.131]  And it shows a graph of U.S.
[01:13:50.171 --> 01:13:51.492]  helmets going down to zero.
[01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:55.335]  And it shows a graph of the police going down to zero.
[01:13:56.116 --> 01:13:58.638]  And what does it show for the U.N.?
[01:13:59.278 --> 01:14:00.039]  The U.N.
[01:14:00.139 --> 01:14:01.881]  tanks and helmets go up.
[01:14:02.881 --> 01:14:09.827]  They go up from zero to all-powerful and everyone else is disarmed but the United Nations.
[01:14:10.428 --> 01:14:11.709]  State Department memorandum 7277.
[01:14:14.351 --> 01:14:16.873]  You can write off to the State Department and pay them like five dollars.
[01:14:17.113 --> 01:14:24.620]  They'll send you the booklet and then it was updated in 1992 by Herbert Walker Bush calling for the world government.
[01:14:26.001 --> 01:14:26.521]  There it is.
[01:14:26.561 --> 01:14:26.882]  Look at that.
[01:14:28.407 --> 01:14:28.848]  You see it?
[01:14:28.948 --> 01:14:30.252]  Internal security forces.
[01:14:30.272 --> 01:14:30.894]  That's your police.
[01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:31.435]  They go down.
[01:14:31.495 --> 01:14:32.117]  Internal security.
[01:14:32.137 --> 01:14:32.819]  They go down.
[01:14:33.621 --> 01:14:35.325]  Peacekeeping machinery of the UN.
[01:14:36.288 --> 01:14:36.949]  It goes up.
[01:14:38.655 --> 01:14:38.995]  See that?
[01:14:39.035 --> 01:14:39.795]  The U.N.
[01:14:39.895 --> 01:14:41.916]  world government goes up.
[01:14:42.716 --> 01:14:45.037]  Its helmets go from little to big.
[01:14:45.657 --> 01:14:48.158]  The Russian military goes from big to little.
[01:14:48.478 --> 01:14:48.838]  The U.S.
[01:14:48.858 --> 01:14:51.719]  military goes from big to little and then goes away completely.
[01:14:52.399 --> 01:14:56.621]  And what does it say in these memorandums from 1961 and again 1992?
[01:14:56.721 --> 01:15:00.342]  It says everyone will have their guns taken.
[01:15:00.642 --> 01:15:02.282]  Well, guess what I saw in the news today?
[01:15:02.342 --> 01:15:03.583]  New York Times was bragging.
[01:15:04.023 --> 01:15:06.744]  They were re-releasing the original Looney Tunes.
[01:15:07.765 --> 01:15:14.790]  With Sylvester the Cat and Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sin and Elmer Fudd, I am hunting for wabbits.
[01:15:16.151 --> 01:15:22.036]  Oh, and Marvin the Martian and Stratium-12 Detonator, here to destroy the Earth, you pesky Earth creature.
[01:15:22.916 --> 01:15:24.938]  They're taking away everyone's guns.
[01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:27.780]  It's the originals, but they've all been photoshopped out.
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.422]  Kind of like, well, you know, Amos.
[01:15:32.244 --> 01:15:38.828]  Han Solo in the first Star Wars, remember he didn't shoot Guido first, even though Guido was aimed at him.
[01:15:40.029 --> 01:15:45.752]  That's right, now he chases Bugs Bunny with a scythe, a sickle.
[01:15:46.072 --> 01:15:49.374]  This is total cult programming.
[01:15:49.774 --> 01:15:51.916]  But they're not getting rid of our guns for peace.
[01:15:53.096 --> 01:15:55.758]  They're getting rid of our guns so we're totally enslaved.
[01:15:57.935 --> 01:16:01.657]  That's what they're doing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:02.118 --> 01:16:03.378]  And it's a battle plan.
[01:16:03.679 --> 01:16:04.779]  And it's a program.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:14.025]  And when they finally get their world government in, the chess game is about total, absolute dehumanization.
[01:16:15.906 --> 01:16:19.789]  And reducing the human population down to 500 million, the UN officially says.
[01:16:20.029 --> 01:16:21.430]  So playing the game is death.
[01:16:22.236 --> 01:16:23.597]  And playing the game is insane.
[01:16:24.118 --> 01:16:25.599]  And playing the game is something you can't do.
[01:16:25.919 --> 01:16:31.404]  Do you understand that I don't tell you stuff that isn't on record?
[01:16:31.684 --> 01:16:33.706]  And of course I flipped out learning all this.
[01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:35.188]  Of course it was crazy.
[01:16:36.235 --> 01:16:38.857]  All because I stopped reading comic books when I was about seven.
[01:16:39.318 --> 01:16:42.840]  I'd have about any comic books, whatever I wanted, Hardy Boys, always a big reader.
[01:16:42.901 --> 01:16:52.789]  By the time I was about seven, Voracious, and about eight or nine, I started reading history books about the Romans and the Greeks and Africa and China and Japan and our history and all of it.
[01:16:53.249 --> 01:16:55.271]  And then all of a sudden I started reading World War II books.
[01:16:55.751 --> 01:16:58.732]  And it was all there, about secret societies and everything, and mainline history.
[01:16:59.132 --> 01:17:05.514]  And then I went to college, and they told me, America sucks, white people are bad, and all this commie stuff, and I went, I've heard this before!
[01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:06.635]  And here we are!
[01:17:06.875 --> 01:17:08.275]  We've got all their documents!
[01:17:08.615 --> 01:17:09.916]  Are you gonna let them do this?!
[01:17:10.696 --> 01:17:11.856]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:17:15.337 --> 01:17:16.298]  This is the end.
[01:17:18.318 --> 01:17:20.679]  Beautiful friend.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:22.980]  This is the end.
[01:17:24.847 --> 01:17:43.175]  This is the end, my only friend The end of our elaborate plans The end of everything that stands The end
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:51.127]  Can you picture what will be once the new owner's in charge?
[01:17:51.147 --> 01:17:52.849]  They're gonna kill you.
[01:17:53.049 --> 01:17:57.634]  They're gonna pump you full of poisons.
[01:18:08.041 --> 01:18:15.186]  I'm gonna shut your ass down with a big group of dumbed-down people that'll shout you down and kill you if the new world order snaps its fingers.
[01:18:16.287 --> 01:18:17.948]  True lawlessness, that's what this is all about.
[01:18:21.871 --> 01:18:24.173]  And that's what this domestication, this whole program is about.
[01:18:24.193 --> 01:18:28.456]  It's not about peace in the sense of humans working together.
[01:18:29.117 --> 01:18:32.639]  It's about peace in that they destroy civilization, destroy the human future.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:37.283]  It is a satanic nightmare, but it's a dream that they believe in.
[01:18:39.158 --> 01:18:44.162]  All right, let me hit some of the current things that are going on.
[01:18:48.686 --> 01:19:00.357]  I am banned on Twitter, but I do like to look at the leftists out there engaging in their murder of logic just to try to wrap my mind around what level of cooked they've gotten to.
[01:19:01.698 --> 01:19:04.419]  But I noticed they were sitting around this Herman Munster clip everywhere.
[01:19:04.819 --> 01:19:06.320]  You know, major universities in the U.S.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:13.043]  are removing Martin Luther King bust and murals where he talks about don't judge people on what color they are, judge them on their character.
[01:19:13.363 --> 01:19:15.924]  Well, that goes against, oh, white people are inherently bad.
[01:19:18.325 --> 01:19:19.125]  And all this craziness.
[01:19:19.145 --> 01:19:29.350]  But still I see leftists tweeting out this Herman Munster who's just basically repeating what Martin Luther King had to say and going, quotes like, why can't you white people just get it?
[01:19:30.922 --> 01:19:35.163]  I don't know, why'd you attack the Black Soldier Memorial for Civil War?
[01:19:35.183 --> 01:19:41.465]  I mean, the left doesn't know that the black soldiers in the Civil War were on the side against slavery.
[01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:52.509]  And if you try to talk to these folks, they could be black or white, these liberals, they're either the controllers that know what they're doing, and they're communists and looking for power, or they're like, oh shut up, I know that's that secret talk.
[01:19:52.969 --> 01:19:55.489]  And somebody will walk over and go, don't talk to him, he's a KKK member.
[01:19:56.590 --> 01:20:00.311]  Notice no leftist will ever talk to anybody because they're in a cult, folks, these are idiots.
[01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:02.857]  Let me tell you something.
[01:20:02.877 --> 01:20:04.218]  A bunch of dumb cows are dangerous.
[01:20:04.718 --> 01:20:09.039]  If somebody shoots a gun off and makes them stampede, they'll kill you, they'll run you over.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:15.041]  That's why now, I'm in a store, I'm in a restaurant, every person wearing a mask, COVID-19 is a hoax.
[01:20:15.341 --> 01:20:16.062]  Here's the evidence.
[01:20:17.782 --> 01:20:23.384]  Every checkout counter, every person, some lepus gets in my face, I get up, I go over to their table, I get in their face.
[01:20:25.285 --> 01:20:29.586]  The compliance with these people has got us to this point and it has to stop.
[01:20:35.441 --> 01:20:40.444]  I'll be out somewhere and I'll see a bunch of able-bodied men playing basketball or canoeing like I saw today.
[01:20:40.464 --> 01:20:46.787]  And I'll come over to them and I'll say, hey, you know the country's under attack right now by globalist forces?
[01:20:46.827 --> 01:20:47.747]  And they'll start, oh, I don't know.
[01:20:47.767 --> 01:20:52.290]  I'll go, no, no, no, seriously, you know you're going to lose everything you got if you don't get politically informed and involved.
[01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:54.391]  And one guy's like, I actually know who you are.
[01:20:54.431 --> 01:20:55.111]  You're actually right.
[01:20:55.151 --> 01:20:58.333]  I'm, you know, I'm not saying you're bad out here kayaking around.
[01:20:58.373 --> 01:21:00.294]  I'm just saying, you're going to lose everything.
[01:21:01.271 --> 01:21:01.631]  And you know what?
[01:21:01.671 --> 01:21:03.092]  People don't laugh anymore like they used to.
[01:21:03.432 --> 01:21:05.613]  But let me tell you, I talk to everybody.
[01:21:06.313 --> 01:21:06.653]  Everybody.
[01:21:08.094 --> 01:21:14.537]  Hey, you know, every one of these gum packages has aspartame in it that gives you cancer on record and is very addicting, so you shouldn't give it to your children.
[01:21:16.097 --> 01:21:18.238]  Every time I'm at a checkout line, especially if there's children, I say it.
[01:21:18.558 --> 01:21:21.600]  Not because I'm a do-gooder, not because I'm in people's business.
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:22.800]  I'm standing up.
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.081]  I'm not laying down.
[01:21:24.441 --> 01:21:27.822]  I'm not gonna adapt to being a slave and adapt to being poisoned.
[01:21:28.122 --> 01:21:29.043]  I'm gonna fight back!
[01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:34.238]  There was a big article on Friday, I forget what publication, you guys pull it up please, thank you.
[01:21:35.939 --> 01:21:41.423]  It was, uh, conspiracy theories against 5G could hurt the economy.
[01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:52.110]  And the article said, people saying they're bad and communities voting 5G out, that's gonna hurt the recovery, by the very left that wants to destroy us, and other people are burning them down.
[01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:54.552]  Well let me just tell you, don't burn them down, vote them out.
[01:21:57.381 --> 01:22:00.203]  Because all the cell phone radiation is bad for you.
[01:22:00.223 --> 01:22:00.884]  That's in the studies.
[01:22:01.124 --> 01:22:03.005]  But the 5G saturates you.
[01:22:04.466 --> 01:22:06.007]  And they want to put 5 million of them up.
[01:22:08.309 --> 01:22:09.090]  But that was the headline.
[01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:15.094]  It was... It was... 5G conspiracy theories could hurt the economy.
[01:22:16.575 --> 01:22:17.416]  Hurt the economy.
[01:22:20.138 --> 01:22:20.838]  Hurt the economy.
[01:22:22.059 --> 01:22:25.462]  You know, almost everybody in the vaccine trials has almost died.
[01:22:26.886 --> 01:22:29.648]  So they've now quietly had to stop the vaccine trials in the U.S.
[01:22:30.409 --> 01:22:33.691]  because the people are getting paralyzed.
[01:22:35.072 --> 01:22:40.297]  If you try to put that out, the people that have been on CNN that went and got it almost died, that's being banned.
[01:22:40.337 --> 01:22:44.340]  They won't even let famous people that were in the trials go on Twitter now.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.062]  Does anybody understand how oppressive that is?
[01:22:47.102 --> 01:22:47.582]  How evil?
[01:22:47.823 --> 01:22:48.723]  What's coming next?
[01:22:50.905 --> 01:22:51.986]  The Washington Post, there it is.
[01:22:53.827 --> 01:22:54.428]  5G kills.
[01:22:54.488 --> 01:22:55.709]  Oh, we got a t-shirt that says that.
[01:22:56.578 --> 01:22:58.799]  That infowarestore.com and you find the revolution.
[01:22:59.379 --> 01:22:59.879]  5G kills.
[01:23:00.399 --> 01:23:01.700]  Wired Magazine, L.A.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.021]  Times even two years ago said major studies kills.
[01:23:04.561 --> 01:23:05.481]  You like a brain tumor?
[01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:07.242]  What it really does is skin cancer.
[01:23:09.043 --> 01:23:10.563]  It beams through everything.
[01:23:11.043 --> 01:23:12.684]  It's super powerful.
[01:23:12.744 --> 01:23:13.764]  Doesn't go long distances.
[01:23:15.265 --> 01:23:18.006]  But they're putting it up every 50 yards in Austin.
[01:23:21.049 --> 01:23:22.250]  Well, there's a lot of news I didn't hit.
[01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:23.191]  I'm almost out of time.
[01:23:23.652 --> 01:23:25.514]  I wanted just to hit some contemporary news.
[01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:32.641]  They're running the same playbook they ran against Trump four years ago, but with intensified censorship.
[01:23:32.861 --> 01:23:34.523]  They've got all these fake polls out.
[01:23:34.903 --> 01:23:36.165]  How unpopular is Trump?
[01:23:36.305 --> 01:23:36.985]  They're push polls.
[01:23:38.026 --> 01:23:41.290]  They create the illusion he's going to lose, so people bandwagon and go for Biden.
[01:23:42.495 --> 01:23:47.879]  And they use push polls when they make the poll to say a horrible thing about Trump so that people then get turned off by him.
[01:23:48.119 --> 01:23:49.500]  So that's a tactic that's going on.
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:52.722]  Romney has come out against Trump.
[01:23:52.782 --> 01:23:54.583]  That's no big surprise.
[01:23:54.623 --> 01:23:56.825]  Neocon Colin Powell says he'll vote for Biden.
[01:23:57.165 --> 01:24:02.108]  Well, I mean, you're the help-kill-millions-in-Iraq dude with the fake WMD stuff, so that's more for me.
[01:24:02.309 --> 01:24:08.253]  Trump's pulling us out of Iraq, pulling us out of Afghanistan, and this mass murderer, Colin Powell, may he rot in hell.
[01:24:11.141 --> 01:24:13.382]  He's like the top knight commander under Queen Elizabeth.
[01:24:13.402 --> 01:24:14.323]  I mean, he's a piece of trash.
[01:24:16.323 --> 01:24:18.264]  Oh, but George W. Bush doesn't like him.
[01:24:18.465 --> 01:24:21.706]  They're calling him a racial healer and a hero.
[01:24:22.186 --> 01:24:23.767]  Black Lives Matter is calling him a hero.
[01:24:24.808 --> 01:24:27.269]  These people are all just a bunch of criminals that want to run our lives.
[01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:29.730]  Show all the big globalists, all the big neocons.
[01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:31.251]  The New World Order doesn't like Trump, folks.
[01:24:32.331 --> 01:24:34.812]  His dad set up a deal with China to move all our jobs over there.
[01:24:36.873 --> 01:24:40.075]  Oh, good old George W. Bush.
[01:24:41.805 --> 01:24:45.909]  I guess I better not like Trump now because you said that he's bad.
[01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:48.070]  What a sick joke.
[01:24:50.192 --> 01:24:54.776]  Meanwhile ISIS thugs celebrate George Floyd riots and say that burn America down.
[01:24:56.021 --> 01:25:00.784]  And I've got all these articles and all these reports where the left's celebrating the destruction of the country.
[01:25:01.005 --> 01:25:03.006]  They don't want the country to exist and they're such idiots.
[01:25:03.346 --> 01:25:10.191]  They don't get that anywhere else in the world these fat, lazy, stupid leftists would be put in a death camp so quick in communist China.
[01:25:10.471 --> 01:25:14.194]  They are the biggest idiots living in the lap of freedom compared to any other nation on earth.
[01:25:14.734 --> 01:25:15.715]  It is insane!
[01:25:18.496 --> 01:25:27.186]  And then, oh, bringing all these migrants from Africa and Latin America and Asia and all into Europe, and they got big riots there, saying, I'm gonna piss on Europe.
[01:25:27.446 --> 01:25:35.636]  Europe gives you more welfare, more free crap, and the people are rioting and trying to pull down Winston Churchill's statue, saying he's a fascist.
[01:25:38.393 --> 01:25:41.236]  And comparing themselves to people that invaded on D-Day.
[01:25:41.876 --> 01:25:46.020]  Mainstream news is comparing Antifa to soldiers that charge German machine guns.
[01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:53.767]  Scroll down to Paul's tweet, it's got the video of the Winston Churchill statue that was spray-painted and he was a racist and he was a bad guy.
[01:25:54.688 --> 01:25:54.848]  Oh!
[01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:59.192]  It's, yes, it's something we all need to be part of.
[01:25:59.292 --> 01:26:04.017]  And here you've got ISIS cutting the heads off of historical statues and all the rest of it.
[01:26:05.046 --> 01:26:06.167]  Yes, we've seen this before.
[01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:10.591]  That's what the barbarians do, ladies and gentlemen, and the left's allied with radical Islam.
[01:26:11.932 --> 01:26:12.933]  All right, I'm out of time.
[01:26:12.953 --> 01:26:17.076]  I do want listeners to understand something.
[01:26:17.337 --> 01:26:19.518]  When I say that you are everything, you are everything.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:28.266]  When you decide to support the local Aminathem stations and thank them or become sponsors or give them a donation, it makes all the difference in the world.
[01:26:28.286 --> 01:26:30.448]  When you tell people about how they can listen,
[01:26:32.219 --> 01:26:33.860]  At a four-way stop at church.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:34.881]  Get up in front of the church.
[01:26:35.441 --> 01:26:36.622]  Get up at work.
[01:26:36.762 --> 01:26:42.185]  This is the time to step up and step out there and expose this whole damn thing and not be timid about it.
[01:26:42.465 --> 01:26:47.949]  We need leaders that I know are out there of every stripe to take action now or we're going to lose everything.
[01:26:48.769 --> 01:26:49.850]  And it's going to go to full war.
[01:26:51.152 --> 01:26:55.715]  Which I'm not happy about, because the globalists are such trash, I mean, and their minions are such idiots.
[01:26:55.775 --> 01:26:58.177]  It's just, it's like cleaning dog crap off your shoes.
[01:26:58.257 --> 01:26:58.937]  I don't want to go there.
[01:26:59.258 --> 01:27:01.079]  We go there, it's going to be really bad, folks.
[01:27:01.479 --> 01:27:02.740]  They got a lot of tricks up their sleeves.
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:07.583]  So I'm just telling you, spread the word about InfoWars.com forward slash show, band dot video.

[01:27:14.989 --> 01:27:18.411]  And don't forget our 60% off across the board flash sale will end today.
[01:27:18.452 --> 01:27:20.353]  This is the last day across the board.
[01:27:20.393 --> 01:27:21.554]  So much stuff's about to sell out.
[01:27:22.435 --> 01:27:23.395]  Get all the great products.

[01:27:31.661 --> 01:27:32.342]  Be part of history.
[01:27:32.582 --> 01:27:33.363]  But whatever you do,
[01:27:33.943 --> 01:27:41.350]  Get involved and spread the word because you all got red blood, you got a soul, and you got a decision about which way that soul's going.
[01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:42.992]  To God or to the devil?
[01:27:43.532 --> 01:27:46.014]  As for me, I choose Jesus Christ!
[01:27:46.915 --> 01:27:47.936]  Please spread the word.
[01:27:48.036 --> 01:27:48.457]  God bless.
[01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:06.589]  InfoWars.
[01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:08.590]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:28:11.131 --> 01:28:14.854]  And I'm here to tell you I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good job.
[01:28:14.934 --> 01:28:17.015]  I've done nothing but my duty!
[01:28:17.556 --> 01:28:25.981]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people and I've been fighting them for 13 years and I'll never stop!
[01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:35.576]  For 24 years, Alex Jones and InfoWars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide.
[01:28:36.296 --> 01:28:53.971]  Waking people up to the New World Order, Bohemian Grove, the American Deep State, the rise of Communist China, the plan for global depopulation, and global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[01:28:55.248 --> 01:29:01.633]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support, our fight continues.
[01:29:01.673 --> 01:29:06.757]  Join us, support the InfoWar, and together, we will slay the dragon.
[01:29:06.777 --> 01:29:10.340]  Keep fighting Alex, you're the gladiator.
[01:29:10.821 --> 01:29:12.642]  Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:29:13.743 --> 01:29:15.004]  X2, X3.
[01:29:15.784 --> 01:29:20.588]  And over here, Vitamin Mineral Fusion with all the amino acids, the vitamins, the minerals.
[01:29:21.529 --> 01:29:23.491]  Turbo Force, 10-hour clean energy.
[01:29:25.256 --> 01:29:27.898]  You just go on down the line, Vazzo Beats and all the rest of it.
[01:29:29.399 --> 01:29:35.682]  These are things God gave us through the natural environment that we're not supposed to be aware of.
[01:29:37.724 --> 01:29:39.044]  What do you think the drug companies do?
[01:29:39.445 --> 01:29:45.788]  They give you synthetic versions of this for 10, 20, 30 times what that actually costs.
[01:29:47.289 --> 01:29:52.592]  But we promote what God gave us, and we go out and we find the very best products available.
[01:29:52.933 --> 01:29:53.333]  Look at this.
[01:29:53.933 --> 01:29:54.814]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:29:55.984 --> 01:30:02.767]  You know, I remember getting pitched this by a developer six, seven years ago about PQQ and CoQ10.
[01:30:02.787 --> 01:30:05.948]  We had to buy the first product we got from Mitsubishi.
[01:30:06.248 --> 01:30:07.589]  The Japanese are obsessed with this.
[01:30:08.729 --> 01:30:11.890]  And I remember going, okay, this stuff's really great.
[01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:20.714]  And I started taking it, and like a month in, my back that had been hurt, like, was hurting again because the nerves were growing back.
[01:30:22.654 --> 01:30:25.557]  I was having these wild dreams, and I was like, what the hell is this?
[01:30:26.778 --> 01:30:30.181]  Well, it turns out, God gave us a lot of things.
[01:30:30.241 --> 01:30:30.561]  Look at this.
[01:30:30.941 --> 01:30:32.242]  Do it over here, headshot if you can.
[01:30:32.883 --> 01:30:33.263]  Look at this.
[01:30:34.104 --> 01:30:37.267]  Look what's in the bottle of DNA Force Plus.
[01:30:37.327 --> 01:30:39.128]  Look at that.
[01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:48.997]  Because in this universe, we've been given a lot of things.
[01:30:51.317 --> 01:30:58.039]  We take them for granted, but man, I tell you, what's in that is something incredibly special.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.320]  But that's the way it works, isn't it?
[01:31:02.421 --> 01:31:04.341]  All I deliver is what is the best.
[01:31:05.462 --> 01:31:09.603]  And that's DNA Force Plus at Infolarestore.com.
