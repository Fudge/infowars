[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:15.899]  Donald Trump comes out, and I've said this, if Trump doesn't get super aggressive with 132 days left, and if he doesn't stop listening to Jared Kushner and Parr Scales and all the rest of them, if he doesn't go on the war path, and I mean really go after the deep state, the tyrants, all of them, he's gonna lose.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.181]  Well, he's gone on the war path.
[00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:22.924]  Ten years in prison, attacking one of these statues on federal land.
[00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:29.109]  He came out and accused Obama, which is true of treason, still running the deep state government against it.
[00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.371]  This is what we need to hear.
[00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:37.076]  We need to hear the truth and Trump swinging for the fences and the people will get behind him just like that.
[00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:39.438]  This is what the president just had to say today.
[00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:50.659]  On Obama and the spying situation, this idea that they were spying on your campaign, you've been asked before about what crime he would have potentially committed.
[00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:51.500]  Treason.
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.040]  Treason.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.941]  It's treason.
[00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:54.822]  Look, look.
[00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:58.985]  When I came out a long time ago, I said they've been spying on my campaign.
[00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:03.709]  I said they've been taping and that was in quotes, meaning a modern day version of taping.
[00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.650]  It's all the same thing, but a modern day version.
[00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:07.932]  But they've been spying on my campaign.
[00:01:08.052 --> 00:01:09.554]  I told you that a long time ago.
[00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:10.915]  Turned out I was right.
[00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:12.296]  Let's see what happens to him now.
[00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:15.258]  Durham is
[00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.554]  I never met Durham because I want to stay out of it because otherwise it's going to look political.
[00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:25.478]  But Durham, as you know, is a highly respected person.
[00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.181]  And Bill Barr is doing a great job as Attorney General.
[00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:30.963]  Let's see what they come up with.
[00:01:31.623 --> 00:01:33.845]  But they don't have to tell me.
[00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:39.290]  All I have to do is read the papers, the insurance policy in case
[00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.091]  She doesn't win.
[00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:43.093]  We've got an insurance policy.
[00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:47.416]  Well, that was all the stuff that we went through over the last, let's say, two and a half years.
[00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:48.057]  Now we caught him.
[00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:50.959]  We caught him called struck and paged to two lovers.
[00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:56.004]  Brennan and Clapper, the way they lied.
[00:01:56.064 --> 00:01:57.065]  Democrats can't stand Barr.
[00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:57.725]  Homey.
[00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:00.027]  They just... They can't stand who?
[00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:00.508]  Bill Barr.
[00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:02.309]  They just think he's... You know why?
[00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:03.851]  Because he's doing such a good job.
[00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:06.113]  Because he's law and order.
[00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:13.241]  But he's got them in his crosshairs, and now we have to see what's going to happen.
[00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:29.933]  I will say this, if it were reversed, and if the other side sat, were at the Oval Office, right in that chair behind the Resolute Desk, and it was the opposite, two years ago, 25 people would have been convicted, and they would be sent to jail for 50 years.
[00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:35.817]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:39.628 --> 00:02:48.979]  In multiple videos, we have seen Black Lives Matter strategically stop traffic of innocent locals just going about their business.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.125]  We have seen drivers assaulted for asking to be allowed passage.
[00:02:54.145 --> 00:03:00.292]  And we have seen drivers ripped out of their car and beaten by an angry mob.
[00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:08.572]  Made possible with the support of mainstream media, this seems to be part of BLM's strategy.
[00:03:09.253 --> 00:03:18.824]  Stop traffic, attack innocent citizens in their cars, provoke a survival response, then accuse the driver of being a white nationalist.
[00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:30.811]  Beneath the recent NPR headline, vehicle attacks rise as extremists target protesters, was an image of a car hitting a protester.
[00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:44.078]  But in a video from the same incident, we see an innocent driver who was stopped, harassed, and barely escaped being ripped out of their car before escaping and hitting a protester who was charging at them.
[00:03:44.938 --> 00:03:49.802]  After being called out for fake news, NPR offered no retraction.
[00:03:50.163 --> 00:04:00.832]  Instead, they wrote, the photo does not appear to be an example of the assaults described in the story, and changed it to a three-year-old image from Charlottesville.
[00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.294]  NPR is not only telling dangerous lies.
[00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:16.288]  They are also telling its huge audience that if you don't submit to accepting a beating from the mob, then you will be accused of being an extremist and a racist.
[00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:21.217]  The leadership of Black Lives Matter is openly Marxist.
[00:04:21.517 --> 00:04:24.880]  We are trained Marxists.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.285]  We are super versed on sort of ideological theories.
[00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:37.409]  They say that white people have to die for black communities to be made whole.
[00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.630]  Some white people may have to die.
[00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.072]  I'm confused on why that's so controversial.
[00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:44.554]  They admit that there is no plan other than destruction.
[00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:51.456]  And that the destruction is what will fuel the black minds to recreate a new world.
[00:04:52.517 --> 00:04:55.317]  The full-on destruction of America is underway.
[00:04:56.398 --> 00:05:04.120]  Violent racial attacks against white people are being celebrated on social media as some sort of social justice.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.462]  But any sane, reasonable mind understands that this only serves to frighten, divide, and enrage the people.
[00:05:14.843 --> 00:05:23.089]  History is being destroyed before our very eyes, and the movement is now calling for the destruction of Christian churches.
[00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.932]  And nothing is being done to stop any of it.
[00:05:28.053 --> 00:05:34.117]  It seems as if most Americans would rather surrender their freedom than be called a bad name.
[00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:39.081]  But a person who fears another man's judgment can never be free.
[00:05:40.762 --> 00:05:43.024]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:46.738 --> 00:05:53.500]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.021]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:57.461]  We love the American people.
[00:06:08.644 --> 00:06:10.845]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:06:10.885 --> 00:06:12.285]  We love the American people.
[00:06:12.385 --> 00:06:13.766]  We love the American people.
[00:06:15.726 --> 00:06:17.088]  We love the American people.
[00:06:17.108 --> 00:06:32.004]  They came in peace.
[00:06:32.044 --> 00:06:34.226]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:35.648]  We love the American people.
[00:06:43.391 --> 00:06:44.653]  This is CNN.
[00:06:44.673 --> 00:06:52.848]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:10.905]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:13.286]  You better believe you got one!
[00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:20.370]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.852]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:07:22.912 --> 00:07:24.953]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:28.795]  On this June 23rd, 2020, Tuesday, worldwide broadcast.
[00:07:32.878 --> 00:07:39.041]  Well, there is so much to cover and break down today, and we're going to be going over all of it in great detail.
[00:07:39.602 --> 00:07:46.466]  Gavin McInnes has now been banned off the last big tech platform, that being YouTube, for thought crime.
[00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:48.107]  He'll be joining us bottom of the hour.
[00:07:48.227 --> 00:08:00.894]  James O'Keefe joins us at the start of the hour with a huge Facebook inside whistleblower with super important intel on how they're involved in not just election meddling, but psychological warfare against the people of the planet Earth.
[00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:07.106]  And we have so many other, again, special guests that are going to be joining us today.
[00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:11.710]  And Paul Joseph Watson, he is hosting the fourth hour.
[00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:19.899]  That said, I have some very important information I'm going to cover at the start of the next segment.
[00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:25.684]  And that is the exemptions on wearing masks in major states.
[00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:28.081]  Like California and Texas.
[00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:34.627]  You have to ask yourself, why are these exemptions the same exemptions in multiple states?
[00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:40.553]  And that's because a central group is writing all this and preparing all of this.
[00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:44.977]  And that group is called the WHO and the NIH.
[00:08:46.178 --> 00:08:49.822]  And that itself exposes the entire situation.
[00:08:51.203 --> 00:09:14.240]  But this is about creating fear, about creating hysteria, and about setting the precedent that when the government says you need to stay in your house, or you need to stay six feet apart, or you need to wear a mask, you do it ahead of the contact tracing apps that they're already rolling out, we told you about six months ago, for total Internet of Things ID, global social credit score.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.681]  That's why this has got to be fought.
[00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:17.703]  It's not just, oh, get over it, wear your mask.
[00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:24.705]  You know, maybe statistically it'll help somebody, even though it's been proven to be a fraud, and COVID-19's a fraud, and the numbers are a hoax.
[00:09:24.945 --> 00:09:27.328]  They're actually killing people to get the money and say they had COVID.
[00:09:27.569 --> 00:09:30.532]  Despite all that, oh, just wear it and go along to get along.
[00:09:30.592 --> 00:09:35.218]  No, it's about accepting contact tracing and the total rollout of control.
[00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:40.847]  And it is also, of course, about the forced inoculations that are coming.
[00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:49.836]  You notice Bill Gates was universally rejected when he became our Lord and Savior who would decide our entire medical lives, our financial lives.
[00:09:49.896 --> 00:09:58.945]  And he told us we're never opening again until we take his dangerous experimental vaccines that have been shut down in the trials because they're maiming and killing people.
[00:09:59.525 --> 00:10:00.185]  Has he even come out?
[00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.546]  That's happening, but it's a minor footnote.
[00:10:02.946 --> 00:10:04.367]  So that's ultra-massive news.
[00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:16.271]  On the contact tracing, even USA Today reports that Apple and Google are working with Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clinton Global Initiative of their foundation.
[00:10:16.371 --> 00:10:16.931]  And on the board,
[00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:20.402]  Is Chelsea Clinton.
[00:10:21.283 --> 00:10:22.523]  Isn't that just perfect?
[00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:34.229]  So this is all the technocracy big tech merging with the NSA and other foreign governments surveillance grids like China to totally control your life and the rollout is COVID-19.
[00:10:34.489 --> 00:10:45.155]  It is just the excuse and the hysteria and that's why we're making a big announcement later in the second hour today of a nationwide movement
[00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:49.282]  The movement's going to be called We Can't Breathe.
[00:10:49.722 --> 00:10:51.803]  The website's going to be WeCan'tBreathe.news.
[00:10:51.863 --> 00:10:57.245]  It'll be up this afternoon with a video report and a document article and an action plan.
[00:10:57.645 --> 00:11:09.070]  And I will be out at the Texas Capitol this Sunday at high noon to protest the governor's capitulation to Gavin Newsom and the UN.
[00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:13.112]  Gavin Newsom orders masks last week.
[00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:18.433]  Other blue cities say they pass laws saying you have to wear them for a year at least.
[00:11:18.473 --> 00:11:20.054]  It'll probably never end until you take your shot.
[00:11:21.035 --> 00:11:29.042]  And Governor Greg Abbott clicks his heels and says, how high, Master, to Newsom, and comes out and says, OK, we have guidelines.
[00:11:29.062 --> 00:11:29.963]  You should all wear a mask.
[00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.511]  Hell, you should wear a mask when you're in the swimming pool.
[00:11:32.531 --> 00:11:34.752]  You should wear a mask when you're in the grave.
[00:11:35.032 --> 00:11:36.733]  You should wear a mask when you're standing on your head.
[00:11:37.133 --> 00:11:38.094]  It's all completely made up.
[00:11:38.454 --> 00:11:45.398]  But there are waivers, loopholes that they don't want you to know about that we're going to show you the actual quote guidelines.
[00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:46.699]  These are not laws.
[00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:48.780]  These are edicts through peer pressure.
[00:11:49.565 --> 00:11:52.108]  They're trying to get you to take vaccines when there's no law to take them.
[00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:56.554]  They're trying to get you to accept contact tracing and control apps that track you when there's no law.
[00:11:56.975 --> 00:12:02.122]  They're trying to herd you into this situation and people need to say no.
[00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.112]  In a big, big, big way.
[00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:14.616]  So we're going to show you next segment the actual Texas regulation that is again just tyranny and what California has to say.
[00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:17.998]  They're basically identical so that you have the tools to deal with that.
[00:12:18.318 --> 00:12:21.440]  Mainstream media though is trying to act like that is not the case.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.381]  So that is
[00:12:25.305 --> 00:12:25.945]  Coming up.
[00:12:26.065 --> 00:12:28.046]  Separately, Hollywood is collapsing.
[00:12:28.566 --> 00:12:32.867]  A whole bunch of producers are dying and committing suicide as their pedophilia comes out.
[00:12:33.407 --> 00:12:41.049]  That is all coming up and that ties into these giant pedophile networks that are collapsing, that are in big, serious, substantial trouble.
[00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:45.631]  It is the pedophile network they use to blackmail and control the population.
[00:12:46.051 --> 00:12:49.091]  Now, yesterday when I started this show, I told you 24 hours left
[00:12:51.505 --> 00:12:56.489]  On the tail end of the big mega sale and the items that are still 60 to 70 percent off.
[00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.711]  That will end at 1 p.m.
[00:12:58.771 --> 00:13:03.516]  today and a new sale that's a good sale but not the same sale will kick in.
[00:13:04.713 --> 00:13:10.077]  So, huge savings on select best-selling high-quality products that we still have in stock, but not for long.
[00:13:10.177 --> 00:13:17.623]  Brain Force Plus, our best-selling Brain Boost nootropic that's got thousands of five-star reviews and a 98% review on Power Reviews.
[00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:19.285]  Number one overall bestseller.
[00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:21.747]  It is 60% off.
[00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:24.048]  Turbo Force, incredible quality.
[00:13:24.068 --> 00:13:25.329]  10-hour clean energy.
[00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:26.410]  Amazing.
[00:13:26.811 --> 00:13:28.892]  It is 60% off.
[00:13:29.293 --> 00:13:31.775]  Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, that will be sold out.
[00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:34.177]  And I'm not even sure when we're going to be able to remake that.
[00:13:34.797 --> 00:13:35.998]  That is selling out soon.
[00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:38.220]  That is 60% off.
[00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:40.622]  The protein bar is 60% off, about to sell out.
[00:13:40.683 --> 00:13:41.964]  Biotrysillinium, about to sell out.
[00:13:42.384 --> 00:13:43.385]  From the mustard seed.
[00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:47.549]  That is available as well at infowarestore.com.
[00:13:47.589 --> 00:13:50.271]  And here's the big one that will end at 1 p.m.
[00:13:50.631 --> 00:13:51.672]  Central Standard Time today.
[00:13:51.692 --> 00:13:55.136]  When I have one more hour on the show, I'll announce the new specials.
[00:13:55.476 --> 00:13:55.656]  70% off.
[00:13:55.696 --> 00:13:56.577]  That's at cost.
[00:13:56.997 --> 00:13:57.818]  The a.m.
[00:13:58.278 --> 00:13:58.739]  p.m.
[00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:12.600]  Power Pack with 13 different high-quality vitamins, minerals, fish oil, other trace elements, where you take half of the morning, half of it in the evening, and it absolutely is incredible.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:21.727]  This is a way for you, your friends, your family, to not forget to take action, ladies and gentlemen, and to give yourself these incredible ingredients that God gave us.
[00:14:21.987 --> 00:14:23.729]  And let me tell you, people are blown away.
[00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:26.711]  Two little packs you take each day, game-changing.
[00:14:27.291 --> 00:14:29.052]  This product, we double-ordered this.
[00:14:30.643 --> 00:14:44.050]  They made a clerical error, somebody did, and they double ordered a mass ton of this, and so I've been selling it massively discounted, but it's close in a few months to selling out, so it's not going to go back to regular price.
[00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:47.292]  It's not going to go back to regular price.
[00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:48.152]  It's going to be about 25% off.
[00:14:50.033 --> 00:14:57.937]  Until it sells out as a very popular product now that we massively discount it, but we really can't sell it at cost, so we may discontinue that as well.
[00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:09.022]  So if you want the 8-pack Power Stack at 70% off, here is your last chance to do it at InfoWars.com, at NewsWars.com, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:15:09.182 --> 00:15:16.986]  If you just go to those websites, you can find all the banners that link to the shopping cart, which is
[00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:19.727]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:15:19.767 --> 00:15:30.353]  But again, you can find the banners at InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com, or you can call 888-253-3139, and it is your purchases that make this entire broadcast possible.
[00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:32.774]  Oh, and one last thing I almost forgot, and I'm done blogging this hour.
[00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:37.900]  All the t-shirts are at cost and most of them have sold out.
[00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:41.824]  We're going to have to reorder all the inventory of the shirts that we're going to still carry.
[00:15:42.284 --> 00:15:43.866]  So a lot of these are collector's items.
[00:15:43.886 --> 00:15:44.807]  A lot of these are limited edition.
[00:15:44.827 --> 00:15:45.788]  A lot of these are one-offs.
[00:15:46.248 --> 00:15:47.029]  Some are great shirts.
[00:15:47.089 --> 00:15:48.350]  Some I designed aren't that good.
[00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:49.371]  It doesn't matter.
[00:15:49.411 --> 00:15:50.813]  These are pieces of history.
[00:15:51.053 --> 00:15:54.717]  They help spread the word in the third dimension against these censors that want to shut everybody's speech down.
[00:15:55.137 --> 00:15:55.538]  So again,
[00:15:57.515 --> 00:15:58.155]  All of them are $9.95.
[00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:00.477]  Some shirts cost us $15.
[00:16:00.537 --> 00:16:01.657]  Some shirts cost us $5.
[00:16:01.937 --> 00:16:02.698]  The average is about $9.95.
[00:16:03.238 --> 00:16:04.799]  So these are at cost.
[00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.840]  You may be getting a $15 shirt that costs you to print.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.041]  Maybe you're getting a $5 shirt.
[00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:08.501]  They're all $9.95.
[00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:11.763]  And then you can spread the word.
[00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:13.103]  They're great conversation pieces.
[00:16:13.143 --> 00:16:14.744]  They're great ways to meet like-minded people.
[00:16:15.024 --> 00:16:16.865]  Some of the shirts aren't that politically incorrect.
[00:16:16.905 --> 00:16:19.607]  So unless you're an InfoWars viewer, you won't know what they are.
[00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:21.488]  So that's kind of a cool down low.
[00:16:22.308 --> 00:16:23.029]  Waited on the DL?
[00:16:23.369 --> 00:16:28.014]  Or wear a big ol' Infowars red on blue, American flag, totin' evil shirt.
[00:16:28.434 --> 00:16:31.297]  You may meet your next best friend or you may get shot in the head.
[00:16:31.317 --> 00:16:33.439]  We got all that coming up too.
[00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:37.543]  Antifa and BLM are now blowing people's heads off all over the country.
[00:16:38.023 --> 00:16:41.526]  If you don't let them pull you out of the car and beat the living snot out of you.
[00:16:41.827 --> 00:16:43.949]  And the media is praising those that do kill.
[00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:56.937]  And we've proven that we have our pulse on exactly what's going on on the planet from a globalist perspective.
[00:16:57.777 --> 00:16:59.839]  I'm standing on a mountaintop next to Lucifer.
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.141]  I've not bowed to Lucifer.
[00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:04.422]  I'm not serving Lucifer.
[00:17:05.502 --> 00:17:10.086]  But I'm seeing the same vista and the same horizon as Lucifer.
[00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:13.428]  I am seeing it from the Luciferian perspective.
[00:17:14.008 --> 00:17:14.809]  And that's why they hate me.
[00:17:16.147 --> 00:17:23.270]  Is they don't want their own compartmentalized minions having the big high-level Field Marshal view.
[00:17:23.911 --> 00:17:25.732]  And those aren't words, everyone knows it.
[00:17:25.992 --> 00:17:28.253]  This is the Field Marshal view.
[00:17:28.753 --> 00:17:33.515]  Alex Jones is facing an increasing number of platforms who will no longer publish his content.
[00:17:33.715 --> 00:17:43.620]  A host of social media and tech companies have joined Apple in banning far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his InfoWars network from their platforms.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.362]  It's one of the biggest moves yet from Facebook in its efforts to curb hate speech.
[00:17:48.822 --> 00:18:02.009]  The bans target some of the most well-known far-right personalities in the US and the UK, including Alex Jones, founder of the conspiracy website InfoWars, and ex-Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos.
[00:18:02.574 --> 00:18:08.819]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:23.369]  In it, their statement from a PayPal spokesperson said that we have undertaken an extensive review of the InfoWars site and found instances that promoted hate or discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions which run counter to our core values of inclusion.
[00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.552]  For that reason, they have ended their relationship.
[00:18:26.612 --> 00:18:27.773]  People who follow
[00:18:28.493 --> 00:18:31.995]  Alex Jones and InfoWars say that this is a free speech issue.
[00:18:32.455 --> 00:18:35.337]  Whether or not how they impact people is not the point.
[00:18:35.577 --> 00:18:47.384]  The point is that these are the largest social networks in the world, their populations are larger than any country on earth, and thus InfoWars and Alex Jones should be allowed to say what they say.
[00:18:48.264 --> 00:18:56.449]  The people who are against them say, no, harassment is not okay, these platforms have rules against this kind of behavior, and they need to be enforced.
[00:18:57.049 --> 00:19:07.112]  And after the violation from a post yesterday, Twitter decided that it was time for him to receive the most onerous punishment, which is a permanent suspension.
[00:19:07.192 --> 00:19:15.814]  That means none of his accounts can be reviewed globally, that he's not allowed to make new accounts anymore, and he is permanently kicked off the platform.
[00:19:16.534 --> 00:19:20.175]  It wasn't for fake news that Apple banned his podcasts on Sunday.
[00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:26.714]  A company spokesperson said it was for hate speech, though they didn't cite a particular piece of content.
[00:19:27.395 --> 00:19:32.118]  Facebook, Spotify and YouTube quickly followed on Monday, also citing hate speech.
[00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:34.320]  It's just, it's like anonymous.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.622]  You don't know who's what, who's good, who's bad.
[00:19:37.842 --> 00:19:38.963]  I just know I'm real.
[00:19:39.123 --> 00:19:39.944]  I know you're real.
[00:19:40.484 --> 00:19:49.031]  And I know that the Southern District of New York and Berman being fired and refusing to step down and then finally stepping down because it's the law.
[00:19:50.444 --> 00:19:52.248]  is emblematic of everything we're facing.
[00:19:52.288 --> 00:19:57.598]  And I knew before he refused to step down, the president even fired him.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.321]  Imagine that.
[00:20:00.484 --> 00:20:02.367]  That's the circles InfoWars is in.
[00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:23.802]  The world is going into an artificial financial collapse.
[00:20:24.302 --> 00:20:35.164]  And the head of the United Nations Sustainable Development Organization said last week that that's a good thing and they're using COVID to lower our standard of living to save the planet.
[00:20:35.584 --> 00:20:43.726]  But it's a bunch of trillion-dollar companies and billionaires who make themselves tax-exempt and own slave factories in China like Apple and Nike.
[00:20:44.366 --> 00:20:51.790]  That are then lecturing us that we should be poor and shouldn't be able to go on a trip or have a swimming pool or have a car or air conditioning?
[00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:57.592]  Remember when Obama told Africans in Africa, you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[00:20:58.093 --> 00:21:01.214]  That's what this is about is making slavery cool.
[00:21:01.494 --> 00:21:05.096]  And COVID-19 is the economic weapon that won't just make us poor.
[00:21:05.656 --> 00:21:08.838]  It's going to kill hundreds of millions of people in the long term.
[00:21:09.198 --> 00:21:12.681]  Now I'm going to get into the new lockdown measures that we always knew were coming.
[00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:14.702]  It's been pre-engineered in a moment.
[00:21:15.042 --> 00:21:20.666]  But first, let's just remember that it's on record that all these hospitals were completely empty.
[00:21:21.067 --> 00:21:25.170]  And that the hospital ships Trump sent, there was no patients for them.
[00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:31.114]  And let's remember that it's now come out that for any patient they claimed had COVID,
[00:21:31.474 --> 00:21:38.219]  They got over $52,000 and would put COVID on charts when the person didn't even have COVID.
[00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:45.844]  And that they would count people who died of heart attacks and cancer and pneumonia or the flu as COVID again to get the money.
[00:21:46.164 --> 00:21:53.649]  It's been engineered all over the world because the WHO, the UN, set the standards and the parameters.
[00:21:54.169 --> 00:22:01.174]  And then when all those medical doctors came out, prestigious scientists, the head former virologist at Rockefeller Hospital,
[00:22:02.074 --> 00:22:04.736]  Came out and said, this is a hoax, this is a fraud.
[00:22:05.217 --> 00:22:08.239]  They were banned off of YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
[00:22:08.499 --> 00:22:13.002]  Because the system knows this hoax can't stand the light of day.
[00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:17.945]  And the virus, which is a real virus and a nasty pneumonia, can't stand the light of day.
[00:22:18.345 --> 00:22:21.587]  That's why they're trying to keep you locked in to these compact cities.
[00:22:21.767 --> 00:22:26.911]  And that's why it's spread the most and killed the most people in blue cities and blue states.
[00:22:27.171 --> 00:22:30.053]  That are these urban canyons where people don't get sunlight.
[00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:35.438]  Blue states, blue cities are making similar announcements saying, hey, you got to wear masks for the next year.
[00:22:35.698 --> 00:22:37.159]  You can never take your mask off.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:49.631]  This is all about creating fear and testing obedience and control over the population to wreck the economy and bring in a planetary government based on medical tyranny.
[00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:50.932]  There's still time.
[00:22:51.693 --> 00:22:52.854]  We're good to go.
[00:23:12.885 --> 00:23:14.786]  And to good governors, like Governor Abbott.
[00:23:15.106 --> 00:23:21.269]  And if you hit the streets and demonstrate, and don't let the left intimidate you from exercising your First Amendment, we're going to win.
[00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:24.691]  The globalists know that conservatives, on average, are very compliant.
[00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:26.191]  And we believe it helps America.
[00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:29.373]  And so they're telling us that we have to stay indoors or we're bad.
[00:23:29.873 --> 00:23:35.376]  But the leftists and the anti-fun, the Black Lives Matter, they're heroes when they go out and protest.
[00:23:36.036 --> 00:23:46.822]  This is all a form of martial law to make the American people stand down ahead of this election with election fraud being prepared to artificially, fraudulently remove President Trump.
[00:23:47.142 --> 00:23:52.745]  We can stop it if we simply do the research, face the facts, and take action and say no.
[00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:55.226]  COVID-19 is a hoax.
[00:23:55.806 --> 00:23:58.107]  It's not killing anyone but old people.
[00:23:58.427 --> 00:24:02.930]  That's why they sent people that had it to the old folks' homes to get the numbers up.
[00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.231]  Instead of bowing down to the politicians that follow U.N.
[00:24:06.331 --> 00:24:13.635]  orders, these governors that ordered people into nursing homes to get the death numbers up should be indicted, tried, and imprisoned.
[00:24:14.475 --> 00:24:17.277]  We either go on the offense or we're totally enslaved.
[00:24:17.617 --> 00:24:20.318]  It really is up to all of us now what we're going to do.
[00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:27.542]  I don't want to interrupt, then I'm leaving.
[00:24:28.877 --> 00:24:29.877]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[00:24:29.937 --> 00:24:32.138]  You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's.
[00:24:32.518 --> 00:24:35.599]  And, of course, Harris and Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:36.959]  The crew's volunteered to do it.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.280]  So we're here, live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[00:24:40.661 --> 00:24:41.861]  So the live coverage continues.
[00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:42.981]  Everybody spread those links.
[00:24:43.261 --> 00:24:45.582]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[00:24:45.622 --> 00:24:46.202]  Don't let them win.
[00:24:46.362 --> 00:24:46.682]  No BS.
[00:24:46.702 --> 00:24:48.863]  Let me tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:50.824]  See, I don't have some Machiavelli manipulative view.
[00:24:51.524 --> 00:24:53.725]  With me, it's all straightforward attacks.
[00:24:53.765 --> 00:24:54.905]  That's the real power!
[00:24:56.038 --> 00:24:58.278]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[00:24:59.139 --> 00:25:02.339]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:25:02.939 --> 00:25:06.300]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.821]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[00:25:17.062 --> 00:25:21.923]  To join a cult or a criminal organization, you've always got to commit a crime.
[00:25:21.943 --> 00:25:24.444]  Because they got to have something on you.
[00:25:26.032 --> 00:25:32.216]  Plus, they want to know you're willing to really do things when you're told to do it.
[00:25:35.038 --> 00:25:39.822]  MS-13 makes you torture a little boy or little girl to death for Satan.
[00:25:41.503 --> 00:25:42.383]  They didn't invent that.
[00:25:43.344 --> 00:25:49.068]  They're just imitating the higher-up criminal organizations and groups that are up there.
[00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.532]  And now, it's all coming out.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:06.949]  That the German government, not just in Berlin, but all over Western Germany, was placing young children with convicted pedophiles to have sex with them, they believe to create the new family.
[00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.733]  They said it's so loving when an adult has sex with a child.
[00:26:11.753 --> 00:26:17.858]  Of course, all the numbers show it totally ruins their life and destroys their innocence.
[00:26:17.938 --> 00:26:20.601]  But this is an inverted reality, isn't it?
[00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:24.344]  And now all these big Hollywood producers are jumping to their deaths and dying and
[00:26:25.572 --> 00:26:26.713]  The whole system's collapsing.
[00:26:26.753 --> 00:26:41.002]  So remember that while the globalists try to drag us down into the depths with them, like we're the mighty sperm whale and they're a giant squid, that everything you see is because their new world order is falling apart.
[00:26:41.863 --> 00:26:44.805]  Their global government, their system is being rejected.
[00:26:45.728 --> 00:26:55.335]  Bill Gates was running around foaming at the mouth just a month ago telling you how to live your life and he had a vaccine for you and you never leave your house and now he's the most hated man on earth!
[00:26:56.916 --> 00:27:10.987]  And I can sit in a restaurant bar on the coast of Texas, on the coast of Florida, anywhere I go, and people don't know who I am and they're all talking about Bill Gates and the New World Order and the pedophiles everywhere.
[00:27:11.892 --> 00:27:17.257]  I'm in the surf this week, and people are all around me talking about they don't know who I am.
[00:27:17.437 --> 00:27:20.240]  Again, folks, the worm's turned.
[00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:23.924]  Now those of us on the front lines are going to get vaporized.
[00:27:23.944 --> 00:27:24.785]  We're going to get attacked.
[00:27:25.708 --> 00:27:40.337]  Because the enemy's striking out, but I just want to tell the listeners, you're as important as Gavin McInnes, or as Donald Trump, or as yours truly, because you have word of mouth, and you can spread banned on video and censored on TV.
[00:27:40.357 --> 00:27:50.963]  Gavin McInnes has now been banned off his last mainstream platform, even though he even followed the rules and did really great, great A. He's a famous comic, very successful, starred in Vice Magazine.
[00:27:52.142 --> 00:27:53.943]  We're going to go to him in a moment, but first, the big news.
[00:27:53.963 --> 00:27:54.743]  I want to get his take on this.
[00:27:55.384 --> 00:28:11.051]  Donald Trump comes out, and I've said this, if Trump doesn't get super aggressive with 132 days left, and if he doesn't stop listening to Jared Kushner and Parr Scales and all the rest of them, and if he doesn't go on the war path, and I mean really go after the deep state, the tyrants, all of them, he's going to lose.
[00:28:12.132 --> 00:28:13.312]  Well, he's gone on the war path.
[00:28:14.033 --> 00:28:18.055]  Ten years in prison, attacking one of these statues on federal land.
[00:28:19.022 --> 00:28:24.246]  He came out and accused Obama, which is true of treason, still running the deep state government against it.
[00:28:25.107 --> 00:28:26.508]  This is what we need to hear.
[00:28:26.628 --> 00:28:32.213]  We need to hear the truth and Trump swinging for the fences and the people will get behind him just like that.
[00:28:32.233 --> 00:28:34.575]  This is what the president just had to say today.
[00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:47.198]  On Obama and the spying situation, this idea that they were spying on your campaign, you've been asked before about what crime he would have potentially committed, but I remember you talking about- Treason.
[00:28:47.599 --> 00:28:48.359]  Treason.
[00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:49.080]  It's treason.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.960]  Look, look.
[00:28:50.681 --> 00:28:54.124]  When I came out a long time ago, I said they've been spying on my campaign.
[00:28:54.784 --> 00:28:58.847]  I said they've been taping and that was in quotes, meaning a modern day version of taping.
[00:28:58.907 --> 00:29:00.768]  It's all the same thing, but a modern day version.
[00:29:01.369 --> 00:29:03.070]  But they've been spying on my campaign.
[00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.691]  I told you that a long time ago.
[00:29:05.092 --> 00:29:06.052]  Turned out I was right.
[00:29:06.132 --> 00:29:07.453]  Let's see what happens to him now.
[00:29:09.935 --> 00:29:10.456]  Durham is.
[00:29:11.857 --> 00:29:15.639]  I never met Durham because I want to stay out of it because otherwise it's going to look political.
[00:29:16.522 --> 00:29:20.624]  But Durham, as you know, is a highly respected person.
[00:29:21.345 --> 00:29:24.307]  And Bill Barr is doing a great job as Attorney General.
[00:29:24.807 --> 00:29:26.088]  Let's see what they come up with.
[00:29:26.748 --> 00:29:28.969]  But they don't have to tell me.
[00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:34.433]  All I have to do is read the papers, the insurance policy, in case
[00:29:35.447 --> 00:29:36.228]  She doesn't win.
[00:29:36.968 --> 00:29:38.230]  We got insurance policy.
[00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.553]  Well, that was all the stuff that we went through over the last, let's say, two and a half years.
[00:29:42.573 --> 00:29:43.194]  Now we caught him.
[00:29:43.494 --> 00:29:46.116]  We caught him called struck and page to two lovers.
[00:29:47.718 --> 00:29:51.121]  Brennan and Clapper, the way they lied.
[00:29:51.201 --> 00:29:52.882]  Democrats can't stand homie.
[00:29:53.903 --> 00:29:55.625]  They just they can't stand Bill Barr.
[00:29:55.765 --> 00:29:56.646]  They just think he's polite.
[00:29:56.986 --> 00:29:57.446]  You know why?
[00:29:57.486 --> 00:30:01.250]  Because he's doing such a good job, because he's law and order.
[00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:05.175]  But he's got him in his crosshairs.
[00:30:06.316 --> 00:30:08.378]  And now we have to see what's going to happen.
[00:30:08.678 --> 00:30:25.030]  I will say this, if it were reversed, and if the other side sat, were at the Oval Office, right in that chair behind the Resolute Desk, and it was the opposite, two years ago, 25 people would have been convicted, and they would be sent to jail for 50 years.
[00:30:27.657 --> 00:30:28.658]  And that's totally true.
[00:30:28.758 --> 00:30:41.570]  Instead, Big Tech is now working with the Clinton Foundation with contact tracing to watch all our phones, bring in a social credit score, and now they admit they're banning Trump on Twitter with a shadow man, Gavin McInnes, another canary in the coal mine.
[00:30:41.871 --> 00:30:44.933]  Great to have you here, one of the only people as banned as I am.
[00:30:45.374 --> 00:30:46.515]  Quite an elite fraternity.
[00:30:46.835 --> 00:30:47.956]  Thank you for joining us, my friend.
[00:30:49.117 --> 00:30:49.938]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:30:49.978 --> 00:30:50.379]  Good to see you.
[00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.751]  Well, you got banned on YouTube.
[00:30:52.791 --> 00:31:01.514]  Let's get into that and then let's get into the state of affairs and Trump and where you see this all going and how folks can still find you uncensored, unfiltered at Censored.TV.
[00:31:02.815 --> 00:31:04.776]  Yeah, it's the last bastion, the pirate ship.
[00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:06.216]  I mean, I got the idea from you.
[00:31:06.636 --> 00:31:08.617]  If you make your own thing, they can't ban you.
[00:31:09.077 --> 00:31:10.978]  But I was still on YouTube.
[00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:11.979]  It was almost an experiment.
[00:31:11.999 --> 00:31:12.919]  I was following the rules.
[00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:19.142]  But they got paranoid that via the Proud Boys, we were going to go into Chazz.
[00:31:20.814 --> 00:31:28.021]  Just to be clear here, there's Antifa and BLM raping and murdering people, not just in Chaz, but all over the country.
[00:31:28.381 --> 00:31:38.351]  But the second someone implies they might go and offend those people, shut down, burn the library, burn the books, get them out of here.
[00:31:38.812 --> 00:31:44.117]  They are more scared of a perceived threat than the actual threat that's right in front of their nose.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:32:01.507]  Well they've got to guard their little delicate geniuses that have literally, there's like seven people been indicted the last week for shooting people in the head at BLM antifa where they just block the road and just, if you don't stop now they just shoot you in the head and the media's covering it up!
[00:32:03.308 --> 00:32:06.990]  You've got a bunch of black people promoting Marxism.
[00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.970]  How the hell did they pull that off?
[00:32:09.111 --> 00:32:12.272]  They get two Marxist lesbians, give them a bunch of money,
[00:32:12.748 --> 00:32:21.558]  And the next thing you know, they represent racial equality when they clearly state on their homepage that they're here to destroy the nuclear family.
[00:32:23.661 --> 00:32:23.961]  That's right.
[00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:28.526]  Black Lives Matter is basically a George Soros funded arm of
[00:32:29.901 --> 00:32:31.142]  And if you call it out,
[00:32:58.988 --> 00:33:02.410]  Then you're offending the globalist Marxists and you have to be stopped.
[00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.212]  It's just incredible that they can sell this mayhem.
[00:33:06.473 --> 00:33:10.195]  When all this was happening, I felt like saying, see, I told you so.
[00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:14.497]  Alex and I were warning you people about this for years and now it's happened.
[00:33:14.517 --> 00:33:16.779]  We're in a civil war and now...
[00:33:17.409 --> 00:33:20.491]  Even in the Civil War, they go, will you stop talking about that?
[00:33:20.671 --> 00:33:21.331]  It's not true.
[00:33:21.551 --> 00:33:22.252]  It's Proud Boys.
[00:33:22.632 --> 00:33:23.473]  It's Republicans.
[00:33:23.553 --> 00:33:24.173]  It's Trump supporters.
[00:33:24.193 --> 00:33:24.773]  Well, that's right.
[00:33:24.833 --> 00:33:28.936]  CNN called for a, quote, violent revolution yesterday and an uprising and a headline.
[00:33:29.296 --> 00:33:31.097]  But when we pointed out, oh, we're bad.
[00:33:32.738 --> 00:33:36.760]  OK, well, we're not going to stop pointing it out because that's our job here.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.181]  Well, let me ask you this.
[00:33:38.441 --> 00:33:41.023]  I remember when you were on a couple of years ago, we were both bailing a bunch of platforms.
[00:33:41.043 --> 00:33:42.383]  You said, listen, I'm not worried about me.
[00:33:42.744 --> 00:33:43.504]  Everybody's next.
[00:33:43.824 --> 00:33:45.085]  And now it's happened to everybody.
[00:33:45.445 --> 00:33:46.626]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:33:48.024 --> 00:33:52.428]  It's like Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame, but now it's 15 minutes of cancelled.
[00:33:52.728 --> 00:33:54.069]  And everyone is going to go through it.
[00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.691]  Jimmy Kimmel's racist.
[00:33:55.751 --> 00:33:57.052]  Jimmy Fallon is racist.
[00:33:57.092 --> 00:33:58.293]  Joe Rogan's racist.
[00:33:58.734 --> 00:34:03.418]  All the people that were calling for this racist cancelling are now accused of it.
[00:34:03.778 --> 00:34:05.119]  You got what you asked for, you know?
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:11.645]  Have you noticed, by the way, they're always the ones pushing for punishment for a crime they're doing.
[00:34:12.045 --> 00:34:15.188]  Like Obama said, hey, Trump is election meddling.
[00:34:15.228 --> 00:34:16.109]  He's working with Putin.
[00:34:16.624 --> 00:34:21.254]  And at the exact same time, Obama was election meddling by spying on Trump.
[00:34:26.327 --> 00:34:28.669]  I mean, I just think it's offensive.
[00:34:28.789 --> 00:34:30.310]  I mean, and people have a right to do it.
[00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:30.870]  I just never did it.
[00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:32.031]  You never did it.
[00:34:32.291 --> 00:34:37.315]  But everybody that did blackface then says, you should be banned for making a joke or something.
[00:34:37.495 --> 00:34:38.636]  We'll be right back with Gavin McGinnis.
[00:34:38.656 --> 00:34:39.336]  He's on fire.
[00:34:39.716 --> 00:34:42.458]  You can find him bigger than ever at Censored.TV.
[00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:43.779]  A true thoroughbred.
[00:34:44.059 --> 00:34:44.880]  You can find it right there.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.741]  Go there, support him.
[00:34:46.061 --> 00:34:49.683]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com and Banned.Video.
[00:34:50.584 --> 00:34:52.986]  Coming up, start of the next hour, we're joined by...
[00:34:54.062 --> 00:34:57.824]  James O'Keefe and a major whistleblower from inside Facebook.
[00:34:58.464 --> 00:34:59.425]  I've got the best job ever.
[00:34:59.445 --> 00:35:04.968]  I get to talk to Gavin McGinnis, James O'Keefe, Donald Trump, Michael Savage, Matt Drudge.
[00:35:05.548 --> 00:35:07.109]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:35:07.269 --> 00:35:09.370]  I am literally flying with eagles here.
[00:35:10.111 --> 00:35:10.671]  And I mean that.
[00:35:11.031 --> 00:35:11.672]  Gavin McGinnis.
[00:35:12.765 --> 00:35:23.568]  He didn't censor himself and didn't back down despite them trying to bankrupt him, delist him, put him in prison, putting some of his supporters in prison, lying about it because they're so scared of his wit and his humor.
[00:35:24.148 --> 00:35:26.648]  So in the time we have left in this 10 minutes, you've got the floor.
[00:35:27.008 --> 00:35:37.491]  I've got a thousand questions, a hundred points to make, but what is most important for you to telegraph to this audience today now that you've been kicked off the final node of the internet?
[00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:39.151]  I think it's probably going to be everybody's next.
[00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:41.452]  I mean, this is the global social credit score, isn't it?
[00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:43.392]  It certainly is.
[00:35:44.032 --> 00:35:48.435]  And, you know, you used to always ask me when I'd come on the show, where does this end?
[00:35:49.036 --> 00:35:49.676]  What happens?
[00:35:50.977 --> 00:35:52.478]  What is peak SJW?
[00:35:53.459 --> 00:35:54.980]  Yes, and we're in it now.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.702]  We're in a civil war.
[00:35:56.782 --> 00:35:59.464]  We're in a revolution right now.
[00:35:59.744 --> 00:36:06.109]  There's two Americas and they are irreconcilable because one of them wants to destroy America.
[00:36:06.129 --> 00:36:06.569]  What do they say?
[00:36:06.609 --> 00:36:08.691]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[00:36:09.251 --> 00:36:10.472]  I was banned from YouTube.
[00:36:10.745 --> 00:36:19.687]  For making a subtle threat against Antifa and BLM and these terrorists saying, on my birthday, July 18th, we're going to take this country back.
[00:36:20.227 --> 00:36:22.687]  That was like, no, no, no, no, don't interrupt them.
[00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:23.707]  Don't offend them.
[00:36:24.167 --> 00:36:24.487]  Why?
[00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:35.229]  Why does the media and big tech, the DNC, why do so many people, CNN, why are they so worried about the feelings of people who are trying to burn our country to the ground?
[00:36:35.789 --> 00:36:36.569]  I'll tell you why.
[00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.530]  Because they too want to burn this country to the ground.
[00:36:39.878 --> 00:36:41.478]  And we can't let them do that.
[00:36:41.498 --> 00:36:44.439]  And by the way, I've been watching you for over 10 years.
[00:36:44.479 --> 00:36:54.321]  You always said, because you're a real liberal, not a leftist, is that when you figured out that the left literally hated America and wanted to pull it down and tear it down and burn it down, you had to turn against them.
[00:36:55.682 --> 00:36:59.123]  Yeah, and you know, there's someone else culpable here that rarely gets criticized.
[00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:05.224]  And it's the K-12 union teachers who have been brainwashing our youth
[00:37:05.768 --> 00:37:07.688]  into believing that America sucks.
[00:37:08.008 --> 00:37:09.649]  Like, they don't know what these statues are.
[00:37:09.929 --> 00:37:16.110]  It just represents history, and America, and hard work, and they're just like, eh, screw that.
[00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:28.592]  Teddy Roosevelt totally worked to empower black people, that's why he's in a statue with a black person, and Teddy Roosevelt got shot during a speech, and finished the speech over an hour long, shot in the chest.
[00:37:28.652 --> 00:37:32.393]  I mean, now they're pulling down abolitionist statues.
[00:37:34.538 --> 00:37:36.420]  Don't try to insert logic into it.
[00:37:36.861 --> 00:37:44.668]  Those statues just represent America and these kids have been taught their whole lives that America is evil and has to be rebuilt from scratch.
[00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:46.670]  America was built from scratch.
[00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:48.872]  We tried all of these bad routes.
[00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:50.754]  We treated the Indians wrong.
[00:37:50.854 --> 00:37:51.895]  We did have slaves.
[00:37:52.255 --> 00:37:55.719]  We fought to right those wrongs and we all ended up here.
[00:37:56.084 --> 00:38:04.871]  Through trial and error, to the freest country in the world, where nowhere are blacks and gays and minorities treated better than in America.
[00:38:04.931 --> 00:38:07.313]  It's an experiment that has gone perfectly.
[00:38:07.333 --> 00:38:09.495]  It was a very rocky road to get here.
[00:38:09.615 --> 00:38:11.397]  And now they're using our strength against us.
[00:38:12.738 --> 00:38:13.138]  Pardon me?
[00:38:13.699 --> 00:38:15.220]  And now they're using our strength against us.
[00:38:16.334 --> 00:38:16.835]  Exactly.
[00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:20.780]  They're using our obsession with not hurting people against us.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.922]  Well, that's not working, okay?
[00:38:23.082 --> 00:38:24.184]  Being gentle isn't working.
[00:38:24.424 --> 00:38:29.851]  I think these people have showed their true colors and it's time to drag the country back to freedom.
[00:38:30.913 --> 00:38:33.274]  Do you think Trump was right to wait a month?
[00:38:33.294 --> 00:38:37.235]  Because now Chaz and Chop is being shut down because they're killing people every night.
[00:38:38.696 --> 00:38:40.657]  It's descended into Road Warrior for real.
[00:38:40.977 --> 00:38:46.499]  And now even the mayor that praised it as the summer of love is trying to shut Chop down right now.
[00:38:46.519 --> 00:38:50.140]  No, just to be clear, I shot Chop down.
[00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:53.822]  She moved in immediately after Proud Boys
[00:38:55.016 --> 00:38:58.918]  We're trying to get permits to demonstrate within CHOP.
[00:38:59.258 --> 00:39:02.719]  The second we did that, she went nuts and said it's got to shut down.
[00:39:02.839 --> 00:39:03.299]  I saw that.
[00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:04.660]  Why are they so scared of you?
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:09.342]  Because I'm charming and because we're patriotic.
[00:39:09.402 --> 00:39:12.063]  And they see the Proud Boys, a patriotic men's club.
[00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:15.984]  It's multiracial with Jewish people and gays that all love America.
[00:39:16.284 --> 00:39:18.165]  And they go, this is not good.
[00:39:18.445 --> 00:39:19.806]  I have to paint them as Nazis.
[00:39:19.866 --> 00:39:22.627]  I have to stop them because I need control.
[00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:31.555]  The left really is pathetic, but I see their attempt to collapse the country as them trying to take us down with them.
[00:39:31.895 --> 00:39:33.116]  Do you think that's an accurate statement?
[00:39:33.136 --> 00:39:35.678]  That we're really seeing the collapse of the left worldwide?
[00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:38.880]  Yes, they don't have a life.
[00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:40.181]  Like, what do they do?
[00:39:40.262 --> 00:39:41.142]  They're gremlins.
[00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:45.606]  Their legacy will be that they destroyed a bunch of other people's lives.
[00:39:45.886 --> 00:39:52.531]  They went to college and they came out stupider than when they went in, and these people are going to leave the earth worse off.
[00:39:53.052 --> 00:39:59.394]  I mean, it's one thing to not have a legacy and to have just plotted away and, you know, not stood up for yourself and then died.
[00:39:59.634 --> 00:40:00.914]  That's just a zero.
[00:40:01.254 --> 00:40:02.994]  These people are below zero.
[00:40:03.195 --> 00:40:06.315]  They're sabotaging lives, sabotaging the country.
[00:40:06.595 --> 00:40:07.396]  Imagine that.
[00:40:07.496 --> 00:40:11.797]  Imagine you leave the place worse off than when you arrived.
[00:40:12.237 --> 00:40:13.037]  It's pathetic.
[00:40:15.029 --> 00:40:31.077]  What about NPR being caught with full videos of people attacking cars with guns, and the car panics and drives off survival instinct, and the news says a white supremacist attacks, and it turns out it was a Hispanic lady, and NPR doesn't apologize.
[00:40:31.117 --> 00:40:31.737]  They double down.
[00:40:33.238 --> 00:40:35.880]  Isn't it strange seeing all these people together at these rallies?
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.502]  They have nothing in common from like street thugs to fat NPR.
[00:40:41.081 --> 00:40:42.362]  Well, that's it.
[00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:45.323]  You've got these, you know, the Google twins that started it.
[00:41:02.222 --> 00:41:03.083]  You want to be an underdog?
[00:41:03.103 --> 00:41:05.964]  Try being a Trump supporter in New York City.
[00:41:06.024 --> 00:41:07.165]  They keep saying that we endorse violence.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.101]  We are surrounded by violence.
[00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:35.324]  When we sit down at the dinner table, when we go to a restaurant, our back is against the wall.
[00:41:35.344 --> 00:41:37.585]  When I go to a restaurant, I'm ready to eat people's spit.
[00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:38.065]  I do it all.
[00:41:38.366 --> 00:41:38.766]  I love it.
[00:41:39.366 --> 00:41:40.107]  I just accept it.
[00:41:40.367 --> 00:41:41.908]  I know they're wiping the steak from their ass.
[00:41:41.948 --> 00:41:42.328]  I love it.
[00:41:42.988 --> 00:41:44.449]  I just, like, enjoy the flavor.
[00:41:46.891 --> 00:41:51.033]  I'm at the point now where if a waitress doesn't spit in my food, it tastes dry.
[00:41:51.053 --> 00:41:51.594]  Exactly!
[00:41:51.654 --> 00:41:52.294]  Exactly!
[00:41:56.316 --> 00:41:58.258]  I'll send it back if there's no spit in it now.
[00:41:58.438 --> 00:41:59.379]  I've become used to it.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.042]  You know, I learned a story from Sean Hannity.
[00:42:02.082 --> 00:42:03.623]  I'm not supposed to tell it, but I'm going to tell it right now.
[00:42:04.184 --> 00:42:14.093]  They caught the guy spitting on his steak, the chef at a New York steakhouse, because he put it out on Twitter and he didn't put it out.
[00:42:14.153 --> 00:42:15.615]  He just went, I want that guy fired.
[00:42:15.635 --> 00:42:16.095]  They fired him.
[00:42:16.756 --> 00:42:17.737]  Well, guess what, Sean?
[00:42:19.059 --> 00:42:19.760]  I'm gonna tell the story.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:26.084]  Imagine, Sean is so nice, he only wanted the guy fired when the dude literally put it out on what he'd done.
[00:42:29.627 --> 00:42:30.307]  Unbelievable.
[00:42:30.427 --> 00:42:35.291]  Listen, if somebody came into my restaurant that I hated, I'd go tell them their face, get out, or I'd get in their face.
[00:42:35.471 --> 00:42:37.592]  I wouldn't wipe my ass with their steak.
[00:42:37.632 --> 00:42:39.213]  Again, it's all this sneakiness.
[00:42:39.433 --> 00:42:41.295]  You're right, it's gremlin behavior, isn't it?
[00:42:42.075 --> 00:42:43.516]  That's what I was saying before.
[00:42:43.536 --> 00:42:46.038]  Like, they accuse us of what they do.
[00:42:46.098 --> 00:42:48.560]  They say we want genocide, we want to kill trannies.
[00:42:49.242 --> 00:42:51.903]  That's exactly what they will do when they get in power.
[00:42:51.923 --> 00:42:52.803]  They're Stalinists.
[00:42:52.843 --> 00:42:54.823]  They'll massacre us like Bolsheviks.
[00:42:55.283 --> 00:43:01.004]  And the reason that you and I are a problem is because we noticed this trick and we have the potential to mobilize.
[00:43:01.404 --> 00:43:02.684]  That's the real fear right there.
[00:43:02.884 --> 00:43:04.545]  Like Ann Coulter, for example.
[00:43:05.185 --> 00:43:09.506]  A bunch of Proud Boys were guarding her when she was doing a talk in Florida.
[00:43:09.946 --> 00:43:13.546]  The waitress doxed her location and Tifa showed up.
[00:43:13.906 --> 00:43:17.047]  They saw a bunch of Proud Boys at the table with her and they ran away.
[00:43:17.492 --> 00:43:31.057]  That's why they hate us, because we get in the way of them attacking Ann Coulter, attacking Sean Hannity, attacking you and I. If you stand up for yourself, as we learned with the Covington Catholic school kids, you are being violent.
[00:43:31.357 --> 00:43:34.138]  If you get in the way of their violence, you're being violent.
[00:43:36.259 --> 00:43:40.421]  And I love how they parade around with KKK outfits saying, that's Trump, that's the Democrats.
[00:43:41.621 --> 00:43:41.861]  Yeah.
[00:43:42.301 --> 00:43:46.643]  When did you last see a bonafide KKK person, not stock footage,
[00:43:47.176 --> 00:43:48.957]  Actually walking down a street.
[00:43:49.797 --> 00:43:51.237]  We hear about them every day.
[00:43:51.257 --> 00:43:52.218]  It's a lie.
[00:43:52.478 --> 00:43:54.018]  It's a Marxist lie.
[00:43:54.418 --> 00:43:57.319]  And I think the average American has woken up to that.
[00:43:57.399 --> 00:44:02.061]  And this whole, this whole debacle is going to mean a landslide victory for Trump.
[00:44:03.695 --> 00:44:07.816]  Well, the truth is the left wants to own men getting together and doing anything political.
[00:44:07.836 --> 00:44:09.877]  Like you said, you're not even right-wing.
[00:44:09.937 --> 00:44:10.577]  I'm not right-wing.
[00:44:10.597 --> 00:44:11.398]  I'm just pro-human.
[00:44:11.738 --> 00:44:17.340]  And they're just scared of men organizing against tyranny because they know it's men that challenge tyranny throughout history.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.341]  Most of this is just daddy issues.
[00:44:20.601 --> 00:44:22.622]  That's why they say smash the patriarchy.
[00:44:22.942 --> 00:44:26.843]  Because they feel embarrassed of their inadequacies and they see it in their dad's eyes.
[00:44:26.903 --> 00:44:27.964]  They see the disappointment.
[00:44:28.184 --> 00:44:29.064]  So they hate men.
[00:44:29.485 --> 00:44:33.387]  And they hate men's clubs, and they hate Trump because he seems patriarchal.
[00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:37.328]  Anything fatherly is the devil to them because they know they've been bad.
[00:44:37.348 --> 00:44:39.969]  All right, we'll do five more minutes.
[00:44:39.989 --> 00:44:41.210]  Gavin McGinnis banned on YouTube.
[00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:45.411]  Let's talk about why you got banned, where you go from here, and where this purge goes.
[00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:48.172]  And Trump claiming he's going to take action, but we haven't seen it yet.
[00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:52.394]  And then I've got all the documents, all the proof that the mask laws are not the law.
[00:44:52.454 --> 00:44:53.554]  They're a giant hoax.
[00:44:54.034 --> 00:44:54.715]  That's coming up.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.142]  Big exclusive news from Project Veritas.
[00:44:59.202 --> 00:44:59.963]  It's all coming up.
[00:45:00.283 --> 00:45:05.988]  Please spread the links and tell folks with the local stations you're listening to, because Big Brother's counting on you not doing it.
[00:45:06.008 --> 00:45:14.135]  All right, I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest, and we got some big announcements coming up today.
[00:45:14.155 --> 00:45:14.976]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:45:15.236 --> 00:45:16.998]  Be sure and join us here.
[00:45:18.939 --> 00:45:20.140]  But going back to Gavin McGinnis.
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.642]  Gavin, thanks for coming on on short notice.
[00:45:22.779 --> 00:45:25.120]  I know that you'd really been playing by their rules, as you said.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.701]  You told me this off-air months ago.
[00:45:28.261 --> 00:45:29.141]  I'm doing this as a test.
[00:45:29.181 --> 00:45:34.203]  I'm totally following their out-of-control rules, but it doesn't matter.
[00:45:34.283 --> 00:45:45.906]  An organization you founded that you're not even a part of anymore, they feared that so much that you had to be whacked on the head just as a sign of any resistance to our Antifa army will be met with total censorship.
[00:45:47.807 --> 00:45:51.788]  Can you imagine if we applied any of their rules to
[00:45:52.372 --> 00:45:53.193]  Their behavior.
[00:45:53.513 --> 00:45:59.279]  Can you imagine if a group of mega men took over part of a city?
[00:45:59.299 --> 00:46:00.180]  There was murder there.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.121]  There was a rape there.
[00:46:01.361 --> 00:46:04.264]  We just got news right now that they're handing out guns to people.
[00:46:04.304 --> 00:46:05.505]  They're a full-on insurrection.
[00:46:05.886 --> 00:46:10.150]  Can you imagine if Trump was spying on someone else's campaign?
[00:46:10.686 --> 00:46:12.267]  On his competition's campaign.
[00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:14.629]  Can you imagine if... By the way, back that up.
[00:46:14.729 --> 00:46:16.290]  I just got that 10 minutes ago too.
[00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:23.015]  At CHOP, the autonomous zone, they're handing out guns to resist the mayor now that she says the experiment's over.
[00:46:23.656 --> 00:46:28.879]  I mean, if we did this, they'd send in... They'd send in the Army Rangers day one.
[00:46:30.701 --> 00:46:34.564]  I am cancelled from YouTube for daring to offend these people.
[00:46:34.984 --> 00:46:38.967]  If the rules were reversed, if the rules were reversed and right was left and left was right,
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.841]  They'd be apoplectic.
[00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:42.222]  And they'd be right.
[00:46:42.882 --> 00:46:44.423]  They'd be right to be freaking out.
[00:46:44.643 --> 00:46:45.984]  This is an insurrection.
[00:46:46.004 --> 00:46:55.750]  And our crimes, it's like we're responsible for 150% of the things we do wrong, and they're responsible for about 20% of the things they do wrong.
[00:46:56.931 --> 00:46:58.292]  It's a radical injustice.
[00:47:00.063 --> 00:47:02.304]  Let me ask you this, I always ask you this, what is Pete Crazy?
[00:47:02.324 --> 00:47:04.664]  I think we're starting to see it, but what do you think they're going to do now?
[00:47:05.264 --> 00:47:10.526]  Because they've tried the COVID hoax, and now the race war hoax, and you know, they're not going to stop with 132 days out.
[00:47:12.186 --> 00:47:23.830]  I think they're going to try, because the cases of COVID, which is a bad flu that probably killed more like 60,000, so not our worst flu season, but a fairly bad one.
[00:47:24.994 --> 00:47:28.656]  Those are going to go up again to normal rates as they do in the fall.
[00:47:28.937 --> 00:47:31.218]  And so they're going to try to push for a lockdown.
[00:47:31.638 --> 00:47:35.561]  If America falls for that again, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:47:35.821 --> 00:47:37.402]  Like, they've been disproven.
[00:47:37.462 --> 00:47:41.765]  In New York City, we had a rally for trans, black trans.
[00:47:41.885 --> 00:47:46.308]  There was 200,000 people shoulder to shoulder, barely any masks.
[00:47:46.708 --> 00:47:51.851]  Now, that's not atypical of these riots, these meetings, these protests.
[00:47:52.191 --> 00:47:52.872]  Where's the spike?
[00:47:53.581 --> 00:47:58.144]  It takes two weeks to show symptoms, and they've been rioting for three and a half, four weeks.
[00:47:58.585 --> 00:47:59.485]  Where's the spike?
[00:47:59.565 --> 00:48:05.150]  It's been disproven, yet you still see masks all over New York City, people driving with masks on.
[00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:06.471]  Are you that gullible?
[00:48:06.811 --> 00:48:16.338]  So they might fall for it again, and they'll push for a mail-in, and if they get a mail-in, the Dems will stand a pretty good chance of winning because they are the masters at voter fraud.
[00:48:17.415 --> 00:48:18.896]  I saw a Newsweek headline.
[00:48:19.316 --> 00:48:21.037]  Biggest spike in Tulsa ever.
[00:48:21.057 --> 00:48:23.417]  It takes 14 days with incubation.
[00:48:23.738 --> 00:48:25.798]  People ran out hysterically, got tested.
[00:48:26.139 --> 00:48:27.479]  Most of them are false positives.
[00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:30.080]  And then they have, oh, Trump caused the biggest spike ever.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.641]  Hoax after hoax.
[00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:36.203]  But oh, again, like you said, when the left protests with hundreds of thousands, that's wonderful and beautiful.
[00:48:36.443 --> 00:48:38.143]  But when 6,000 show up for Trump, it's bad.
[00:48:39.784 --> 00:48:41.625]  Has journalism ever been worse?
[00:48:42.065 --> 00:48:43.405]  Have we ever had lower quality?
[00:48:43.686 --> 00:48:47.027]  I was talking to a DNC, a Dem the other day.
[00:48:47.597 --> 00:48:48.418]  About Joe Biden.
[00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:49.900]  I said, I understand that you hate Trump.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:56.267]  I get where you're coming from, but you're actually going to go and check off the Biden box?
[00:48:56.287 --> 00:48:59.711]  And she hadn't heard any of those speeches that he screws up.
[00:48:59.971 --> 00:49:02.474]  He hasn't heard where he just stops a sentence and says, I don't know.
[00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:08.132]  Like, the country's polarized and one bubble is not seeing what's going on.
[00:49:08.252 --> 00:49:09.872]  Oh yeah, I mean, I watch the videos.
[00:49:10.273 --> 00:49:11.653]  He never can talk.
[00:49:12.293 --> 00:49:17.215]  I mean, even official videos he puts out, the ads, he's unintelligible.
[00:49:17.495 --> 00:49:20.136]  I mean, the guy in the, welcome to McDonald's, may I help you?
[00:49:20.516 --> 00:49:29.542]  Listen, Gavin McGinnis, we love you, we appreciate you, and we support you and you're live at Censored.TV.
[00:49:29.602 --> 00:49:30.443]  God bless.
[00:49:38.556 --> 00:49:47.560]  And we are now well in to the kickoff of hour number two on this June 23rd, 2020 live Tuesday transmission.
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:54.703]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to show you the Texas law and the California law that you don't have to wear a mask.
[00:49:55.183 --> 00:49:58.985]  And the fact that they don't want you to see this, and I'm going to explain what's really going on.
[00:50:00.165 --> 00:50:00.825]  That's coming up.
[00:50:01.386 --> 00:50:04.288]  But there's a big story at ProjectVeritas.com.
[00:50:04.328 --> 00:50:06.009]  It's linked up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:08.671]  Facebook content moderator.
[00:50:09.051 --> 00:50:13.134]  If someone's wearing a mega hat, I am going to delete them for that.
[00:50:13.674 --> 00:50:21.879]  Facebook insider Zach McElroy will testify before Congress about the Facebook bias he's witnessing against Trump supporters and conservative causes.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.462]  We are essentially in charge of what gets said and what gets stifled.
[00:50:27.076 --> 00:50:34.760]  McElroy says 75-80% of posts selected by Facebook's algorithm for moderated reviews support President Trump, Republicans, and conservative causes.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.881]  Facebook Contact Review Lead.
[00:50:37.661 --> 00:50:42.884]  It's a very progressive company who's very anti-Make America Great Again.
[00:50:43.324 --> 00:50:44.725]  Facebook Human Directed.
[00:50:45.888 --> 00:50:54.456]  Restriction of free speech raises questions regarding companies protections under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.
[00:50:55.437 --> 00:51:01.403]  And he joins us from the Project Veritas studios where James O'Keefe will be joining us soon.
[00:51:01.803 --> 00:51:05.367]  But we are very excited to have Zach McElroy with us.
[00:51:05.787 --> 00:51:07.068]  Sir, thank you for joining us.
[00:51:07.148 --> 00:51:08.169]  Why'd you go public?
[00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.151]  And just give us the data dump right now.
[00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:10.752]  We salute you.
[00:51:12.179 --> 00:51:13.140]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:13.781]  It's my pleasure.
[00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:14.361]  It's an honor.
[00:51:14.421 --> 00:51:14.802]  Thank you.
[00:51:15.763 --> 00:51:24.152]  I'm here because, well, I'm here for a very specific reason, and that is to fight internet tech censorship, internet censorship.
[00:51:24.192 --> 00:51:30.819]  And as you said, I'm a thousand percent committed and willing to testify in front of Congress for all the things that I've seen and
[00:51:32.546 --> 00:51:32.766]  Yeah.
[00:51:33.066 --> 00:51:37.007]  I mean, this is the biggest issue that we're facing in the lead up to the election.
[00:51:37.047 --> 00:51:39.867]  One of the biggest issues that we're seeing in the lead up to the election.
[00:51:39.887 --> 00:51:44.328]  No, I think the public's ability to communicate and big tech surveilling us.
[00:51:44.688 --> 00:51:46.029]  Everybody focuses on the censorship.
[00:51:46.449 --> 00:51:47.449]  That's not my issue.
[00:51:47.509 --> 00:51:50.429]  It's the surveillance of what we're doing in live time.
[00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:54.430]  If the NSA did this, they'd all be frog-marched into Guantanamo Bay.
[00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:56.031]  Absolutely.
[00:51:56.491 --> 00:51:56.931]  Absolutely.
[00:51:56.951 --> 00:51:57.651]  Well, please continue.
[00:51:58.524 --> 00:51:59.184]  Oh yeah, of course.
[00:51:59.985 --> 00:52:06.809]  We've seen Mark Zuckerberg say time and time again that they don't have any bias at Facebook, and he's testified as well.
[00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:13.052]  He's given testimony saying that there's no bias, but clearly we're showing that there is.
[00:52:13.072 --> 00:52:14.513]  It's simply not true.
[00:52:18.317 --> 00:52:21.119]  There are two big facets to this whole situation.
[00:52:21.139 --> 00:52:27.766]  There's the policy side, where they make these exceptions for their policies, and they have these policies that outright target conservatives.
[00:52:27.786 --> 00:52:30.969]  They have people like Laura Loomer, Milo, everybody banned.
[00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.733]  And then they have the moderators themselves, like I was.
[00:52:35.093 --> 00:52:38.316]  A lot of them are almost all leftists, they're almost all liberals.
[00:52:40.174 --> 00:52:43.875]  Well, they're willing to go rogue and delete anything that they don't like.
[00:52:43.915 --> 00:52:46.656]  They're willing to delete any conservatives that they see.
[00:52:46.676 --> 00:52:48.056]  Well, you're a major whistleblower.
[00:52:48.076 --> 00:52:50.177]  Let's just give people the prime approximation.
[00:52:50.237 --> 00:52:51.077]  What did you witness?
[00:52:51.357 --> 00:52:53.278]  How long were you at Facebook and what made you go public?
[00:52:54.038 --> 00:52:57.879]  Yeah, so I was with Facebook from January last year till the end of February this year.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:03.941]  And I witnessed, for the first leg of it, I witnessed mostly policy issues.
[00:53:03.961 --> 00:53:05.382]  You know, I witnessed, like,
[00:53:06.966 --> 00:53:19.517]  The exceptions that they made that were targeting conservatives, but later on I noticed a lot of people that I was working with were, they were willing to exercise their, I guess, freedom to
[00:53:20.749 --> 00:53:30.296]  Uh, delete anything that they wanted with almost impunity because there are a lot of people who never really saw any recourse for the times that they decided to delete things that they, you know.
[00:53:30.516 --> 00:53:41.884]  And watching the video that's in Project Veritas that we have on InfoWars.com, there's a vitriol, a pleasure, just ruling over people while Zuckerberg tells Congress it's not happening to their face.
[00:53:42.856 --> 00:53:43.276]  Absolutely.
[00:53:43.336 --> 00:53:52.398]  I spoke to one person who I said, you know, well I spoke about just taking down all of the Trump posts that you see and they said, oh, I thought I was the only one.
[00:53:52.418 --> 00:53:58.660]  I thought, I thought, I thought, or I mean, yeah, they basically said that they had been doing it the whole time.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:04.581]  And yeah, this vitriol, the person said that it was revenge against the MAGA people.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.120]  Wow.
[00:54:07.962 --> 00:54:10.685]  So what made you finally decide to shoot undercover video?
[00:54:10.705 --> 00:54:13.709]  Because I love how Veritas, I'm sure, didn't direct you.
[00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:18.515]  Most of the time it's like people just spontaneously want to show this evil and then they show it.
[00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:20.190]  Precisely.
[00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:34.833]  Well, yeah, right from the get-go, when I was in training, I saw all this terrible stuff and I thought, when I was in training for the Cognizant, they were telling me about the policy and they were telling me about all that stuff, and I thought, you know, this is terrible, I gotta do something about this, I gotta say something, but where am I gonna go?
[00:54:34.853 --> 00:54:38.394]  Am I gonna leak this stuff online, get sued for nothing, and nobody cares?
[00:54:38.874 --> 00:54:39.054]  No.
[00:54:39.254 --> 00:54:44.935]  There's no, really, there's no other place, aside from Project Veritas, that does this kind of stuff.
[00:54:45.575 --> 00:54:48.776]  And later that year, I reached out
[00:54:49.477 --> 00:54:58.309]  It kind of clicked with me finally because I've been a fan of PV for some years, but finally clicked with me later that year that maybe they'd be interested, and sure enough, they were, and within a few weeks, we were rolling.
[00:54:59.231 --> 00:55:00.472]  Well, that's really their great work.
[00:55:00.513 --> 00:55:06.000]  It's not just their courage, but the fact that they can actually absorb so many reports, go through them, verify them, and then get them out.
[00:55:07.023 --> 00:55:12.846]  Look, I don't mean this to be politically correct, but it was a policy to put Native Americans in reservations and let them die.
[00:55:13.226 --> 00:55:15.627]  It was a policy that black people didn't have full rights.
[00:55:15.967 --> 00:55:18.068]  It was a policy of Hitler for the final solution.
[00:55:18.468 --> 00:55:26.332]  So you watch Google and Apple and Facebook and Twitter go, oh, it's a policy that we ban and restrict conservatives, and then they lie to Congress about it.
[00:55:26.612 --> 00:55:29.373]  So they call it a policy, but it's far from a policy.
[00:55:29.733 --> 00:55:33.995]  What it is is an ideological bullying and a dominance and election meddling.
[00:55:35.014 --> 00:55:38.657]  It's absolutely ideologically influenced and you know you talk about policies.
[00:55:39.037 --> 00:55:44.421]  I think the most dangerous thing that one of the most dangerous things that they've been doing and this is something that was covered very famously last year.
[00:55:44.762 --> 00:55:48.725]  They had the clause in their violence policy that allowed for.
[00:55:49.384 --> 00:55:57.967]  Uh, calls for violence to be made against people like Paul Joseph Watson and Milo and Laura Loomer and all these people who are on their list, their dangerous individuals list.
[00:55:58.327 --> 00:56:01.688]  By the way, we forget about that and I want to add, I'm very proud of it, I was on that list too.
[00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:06.910]  They said these are individuals that you're allowed to be violent against and then they remove that.
[00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:10.491]  What, do you know the process of who put it on there and who removed it?
[00:56:10.531 --> 00:56:12.572]  Because this was pushed out to all the moderators.
[00:56:12.852 --> 00:56:14.913]  Can you talk about the nuts and bolts of that?
[00:56:15.967 --> 00:56:19.459]  Well Alex, I'm going to tell you right now, you'll probably be surprised, it was never removed.
[00:56:20.239 --> 00:56:24.022]  Publicly, they reported that that was removed, but that was never the case.
[00:56:24.362 --> 00:56:26.083]  They simply removed it from public policy.
[00:56:26.424 --> 00:56:33.109]  Actually, it was still in the private policy that was given to the moderators that they used to moderate the content.
[00:56:33.149 --> 00:56:35.110]  So, they actually... Alright, let me stop you.
[00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:36.291]  This is beyond bombshell.
[00:56:36.911 --> 00:56:37.892]  And tell people the articles.
[00:56:37.912 --> 00:56:40.254]  We'll pull them up on screen because this is a pre-script.
[00:56:40.294 --> 00:56:40.714]  We're live.
[00:56:41.475 --> 00:56:45.918]  Everybody remembers a year ago, whatever it was, Watson learned, I learned that
[00:56:47.259 --> 00:56:51.481]  It said, if it's violence directed at right-wing hate figures, you're allowed to do it.
[00:56:52.162 --> 00:56:54.503]  And so they dehumanized this like Hitler did the Jews.
[00:56:55.203 --> 00:56:57.124]  And then they said, you're now allowed to go after them.
[00:56:57.424 --> 00:56:59.045]  And then when they got caught, they removed it.
[00:56:59.065 --> 00:57:00.966]  But you're saying that was only in the public policy.
[00:57:01.306 --> 00:57:02.867]  The real directive stayed in place.
[00:57:02.987 --> 00:57:03.287]  Wow.
[00:57:03.588 --> 00:57:09.191]  So that is, member Zuckerberg said last year, you can only say Alex Jones's name if it's negative.
[00:57:09.671 --> 00:57:10.691]  But it went beyond that.
[00:57:10.751 --> 00:57:12.953]  They were saying, defend organized violence.
[00:57:12.993 --> 00:57:15.514]  My God, that's criminal mafia racketeering.
[00:57:16.508 --> 00:57:17.048]  Absolutely.
[00:57:17.108 --> 00:57:18.909]  It's illegal.
[00:57:18.949 --> 00:57:21.071]  These people are responsible for this.
[00:57:21.191 --> 00:57:22.431]  I'm going to stop interrupting.
[00:57:22.491 --> 00:57:23.052]  Start over.
[00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:24.413]  You just got me blown away right now.
[00:57:24.833 --> 00:57:26.254]  Major Facebook whistleblower right now.
[00:57:26.734 --> 00:57:30.716]  Walk through that particular story, because this is a keyhole into the whole thing.
[00:57:31.797 --> 00:57:32.117]  Thank you.
[00:57:32.197 --> 00:57:33.017]  I believe so, too.
[00:57:33.378 --> 00:57:39.041]  So, very famously, they had a clause in their policy, the violence policy, that allowed for
[00:57:39.554 --> 00:57:44.896]  Calls for violence against people who are on the dangerous individuals and organizations list.
[00:57:45.296 --> 00:57:46.076]  So what does that mean?
[00:57:46.276 --> 00:57:52.318]  Well, they allow for calls for high-severity violence, which is anything that could kill somebody or severely harm them.
[00:57:52.838 --> 00:58:02.001]  And people like Alderson Watson, yourself, Laura Loomer, Milo Yiannopoulos, a lot of people were on that list, or were at least implicated in that.
[00:58:04.517 --> 00:58:06.858]  They received a large public backlash for that.
[00:58:06.878 --> 00:58:12.080]  You know, obviously, why would anybody be allowed to have, like, basically death threats sent against them?
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:17.962]  And so they quietly removed that portion of the policy.
[00:58:17.982 --> 00:58:21.324]  And I think probably the reason they didn't announce it, because they didn't announce that.
[00:58:21.384 --> 00:58:26.126]  They rescinded it, and it was updates to the stories that broke it that said that it was removed.
[00:58:26.746 --> 00:58:33.048]  Probably the reason they didn't announce it is because they knew, and everybody on the content moderation side knew, that it wasn't actually removed.
[00:58:33.369 --> 00:58:34.049]  It was still there.
[00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:39.904]  Well, my entire time that I was there, and it was still there when I left in late February, and it may still be there.
[00:58:40.244 --> 00:58:49.169]  It may still be that people can make calls for violence and perhaps death threats to people like yourself and other folks.
[00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:53.051]  I am blown away right now.
[00:58:53.451 --> 00:58:54.932]  Zach McElroy is our guest.
[00:58:54.972 --> 00:58:59.215]  We have James O'Keefe coming up with him as well, but I want to learn more as a major whistleblower.
[00:59:00.182 --> 00:59:06.771]  about what else happened, but just what he just dropped on us that that was not a mistake when they said, let people organize to kill us.
[00:59:07.552 --> 00:59:09.174]  And it's still going on right now.
[00:59:09.635 --> 00:59:12.999]  That's why they defend Antifa, that's why they defend BLM, all of it.
[00:59:13.019 --> 00:59:14.041]  This is so dangerous.
[00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:19.353]  All right, Alex Jones back live on this Tuesday, June 23rd show.
[00:59:19.793 --> 00:59:25.918]  James O'Keefe and Project Veritas have knocked it out of the park so many times that I don't even know how to describe each new level.
[00:59:26.358 --> 00:59:29.161]  But Zach McElroy was a Facebook insider.
[00:59:29.181 --> 00:59:29.941]  James O'Keefe's here.
[00:59:30.261 --> 00:59:31.422]  ProjectVeritas.com.
[00:59:31.863 --> 00:59:34.225]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to go to ProjectVeritas.com.
[00:59:34.265 --> 00:59:44.333]  You can actually see the full video with major moderators and managers at Facebook saying, if someone's wearing a mega hat, I'm going to delete them for terrorism.
[00:59:46.275 --> 00:59:47.356]  So there they are.
[00:59:47.416 --> 00:59:48.377]  You wonder what's going on.
[00:59:48.777 --> 00:59:49.138]  Here it is.
[00:59:49.178 --> 00:59:52.841]  So James, you take over with Zach for the nine minutes we have, please.
[00:59:54.082 --> 00:59:54.883]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[00:59:54.903 --> 01:00:05.872]  Yeah, this is a pretty extraordinary expose because Zach is a whistleblower, worked for as a content moderator, came to us at Project Veritas and was basically willing to wear a camera.
[01:00:06.012 --> 01:00:07.954]  So we had some of our other journalists go in.
[01:00:08.966 --> 01:00:18.350]  To talk to some of the people that Zach pointed out to us, and we're able to corroborate a lot of this, is one guy, Dan Will, a fellow content moderator, and he says that Facebook shadow bans.
[01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:19.310]  They're notorious for it.
[01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:25.273]  They say they don't, but it's clear that the content that comes up in the queue is targeting conservatives.
[01:00:25.793 --> 01:00:36.878]  Zach told me on the record, sat down for an interview with me, and said that 80% of the posts that are flagged before they go to content review, the algorithm targets Republicans.
[01:00:38.063 --> 01:00:40.024]  This is the first time we've ever seen this before.
[01:00:40.725 --> 01:00:49.030]  A lot of those videos and images that you're seeing are, some of them are recorded by Zach, some of them are recorded by some of the other people that work at Project Veritas.
[01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:52.492]  So I just think it's wrong for these companies to lie under oath.
[01:00:53.112 --> 01:00:55.113]  I think there are laws against perjury.
[01:00:55.594 --> 01:01:00.637]  So really the issue is what are the people in Congress going to do about it?
[01:01:01.117 --> 01:01:06.120]  Zach's going to testify and Alex, we have other whistleblowers that are about to come public.
[01:01:07.061 --> 01:01:09.404]  At what point does anything happen?
[01:01:09.524 --> 01:01:11.826]  Because you've got election meddling in the company.
[01:01:11.846 --> 01:01:17.472]  I was about to say, you guys have caught total election meddling and lying to Congress red-handed.
[01:01:18.553 --> 01:01:19.974]  Red-handed election meddling.
[01:01:19.994 --> 01:01:25.440]  2016 pales in comparison to what we have in this one video.
[01:01:26.147 --> 01:01:29.651]  So it's really not about election meddling, it's really to them.
[01:01:29.691 --> 01:01:35.518]  Yeah, imagine if we had undercover videos of Russians controlling our telecommunications saying we censor this whole group.
[01:01:35.778 --> 01:01:38.742]  We'd have them, but no, it's actually the Democrats and Big Tech.
[01:01:39.639 --> 01:01:41.900]  Yeah, but it's not about election meddling.
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.080]  Not in the abstract, it isn't.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:49.023]  What they really want is they believe that the results of the election prove that they've failed in their mission in 2016.
[01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:52.284]  So you have brave whistleblowers like Zach.
[01:01:52.304 --> 01:01:53.945]  We have a GoFundMe page for Zach.
[01:01:54.405 --> 01:02:00.388]  And again, Alex, as always, more people coming to Project Veritas thanks to you, thanks to your audience.
[01:02:01.148 --> 01:02:05.650]  Some of these people exist amongst your audience and want to be brave and actually do something about the problem.
[01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:07.951]  We need more people like Zach to come public.
[01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:11.394]  And tell their stories and wear a camera and expose what's going on.
[01:02:13.256 --> 01:02:15.659]  Zach, you guys have a thousand points the time we have.
[01:02:15.679 --> 01:02:17.041]  What do you want to impart to the viewers?
[01:02:18.567 --> 01:02:21.868]  Oh, I want to impart the importance of ending tech censorship.
[01:02:21.888 --> 01:02:28.451]  You know, you cannot have a conservative movement if you're not allowed to speak your mind online.
[01:02:29.531 --> 01:02:33.913]  The digital town square today is the most important thing.
[01:02:34.173 --> 01:02:35.414]  Everybody speaks online.
[01:02:35.454 --> 01:02:36.654]  Everybody exists online.
[01:02:36.694 --> 01:02:44.117]  If you try and stifle free speech in that regard, you're going to absolutely kill a movement before it even begins.
[01:02:44.217 --> 01:02:45.858]  You know, I think we can't see any change
[01:02:46.474 --> 01:02:54.051]  Unless we see why I don't think we can see any change in the country until we see any change in this tech censorship.
[01:02:54.131 --> 01:02:55.454]  We need to see DC.
[01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:56.376]  We need to see.
[01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:04.895]  Congressional reform, we need to see legislation, and that's what I am hoping for, and that's what I'm willing to contribute to.
[01:03:05.316 --> 01:03:06.256]  Let me ask you about this.
[01:03:06.296 --> 01:03:09.919]  With 132 days left, we can't wait.
[01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:14.002]  I mean, what can Trump do executively now to stand up against this?
[01:03:14.042 --> 01:03:16.663]  Because big tech just seems like they don't care, they just disregard.
[01:03:17.964 --> 01:03:24.749]  Well, I know that at least one congressman is writing a letter to the Department of Justice right now based upon Zach's tapes.
[01:03:25.709 --> 01:03:29.532]  Perjury issues, because Mark Zuckerberg testified under oath that they were not biased.
[01:03:29.993 --> 01:03:33.516]  I think one thing that we can ask for is transparency, Alex.
[01:03:33.556 --> 01:03:36.098]  In other words, we want to see these algorithms.
[01:03:36.158 --> 01:03:45.565]  Zach's saying there's some type of algorithm that exists that pulls content that is of a Republican nature for review by a ratio of 3 to 1 or 4 to 1.
[01:03:45.665 --> 01:03:49.649]  Sure, so the filter's set to target conservatives, to persecute them.
[01:03:49.669 --> 01:03:49.749]  Yes.
[01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:52.371]  And then they give that stuff to
[01:03:52.972 --> 01:03:55.033]  Human beings for content review.
[01:03:55.413 --> 01:03:57.994]  So that algorithm, we want to see the algorithm.
[01:03:58.094 --> 01:03:58.875]  We deserve to.
[01:03:58.915 --> 01:04:02.956]  If this was happening on the other end of the spectrum, we would see the algorithm in a minute.
[01:04:03.016 --> 01:04:04.637]  So we're trying to see that algorithm.
[01:04:04.657 --> 01:04:05.397]  We want transparency.
[01:04:05.417 --> 01:04:10.459]  Yeah, imagine if there was an algorithm about what color somebody gets an admission to college or for a home loan.
[01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:11.620]  We'd see that algorithm right now.
[01:04:12.452 --> 01:04:15.174]  Yeah, and they're saying they don't do this, Alex.
[01:04:15.754 --> 01:04:17.755]  They're denying that this is even real.
[01:04:17.775 --> 01:04:18.315]  That's the key.
[01:04:18.335 --> 01:04:24.799]  They've all testified, Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, the subsidiaries, that they don't do this when they're red-handed doing it.
[01:04:25.459 --> 01:04:25.859]  That's right.
[01:04:25.879 --> 01:04:26.980]  Zuckerberg's under oath.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.223]  We're about to release this little clip in a minute of them testifying that there is no bias.
[01:04:32.283 --> 01:04:41.128]  So what Zuckerberg has essentially done here is he's subcontracted out his bias to these third-party companies
[01:04:41.621 --> 01:04:57.014]  Like the one that Zach worked for, this Facebook Cognizant outfit, which is where all these content reviewers do their business, because Zuckerberg wants maybe plausible deniability or a degree of separation from the... Oh yeah, when the Hells Angels gets banned in a town, they create a sub-motorcycle gang.
[01:04:57.215 --> 01:05:00.738]  That's all he's done, is like a mafia, created little sub-families.
[01:05:01.516 --> 01:05:08.418]  Yeah, this is the Cognizant company that Zach worked in, and these are all the people that you're seeing on this videotape.
[01:05:08.478 --> 01:05:10.419]  And some of them worked for Accenture.
[01:05:10.519 --> 01:05:15.260]  Steve Grimmett, who was a guy that worked for Accenture, hired by Facebook.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:22.282]  And they say that, quote, Facebook is a very progressive company and anti-MAGA, and they did a good job policing Trump supporters.
[01:05:22.302 --> 01:05:28.524]  There's Laura Kontakos, a content moderator from Cognizant, and talking about taking down posts for political reasons.
[01:05:28.544 --> 01:05:29.564]  This is the first time we've ever
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.161]  We've seen this inside Facebook.
[01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:37.804]  Facebook was supposed to be the moderate company, whereas Jack Dorsey at Twitter was a little more activist.
[01:05:38.144 --> 01:05:41.966]  And we know that Mark Zuckerberg is trying to curry favor with the president.
[01:05:42.046 --> 01:05:43.246]  Oh, we know they lie to his face.
[01:05:43.386 --> 01:05:44.207]  They all lie to his face.
[01:05:44.935 --> 01:05:47.397]  But I think POTUS has seen this expose today.
[01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:54.181]  I think he's, I've heard that he's seen it, and I believe that he will, this will change his tune as it pertains to Facebook.
[01:05:55.161 --> 01:06:02.806]  Well, exactly, and James, no one needs to talk about how great your organization is, but you, literally, we wouldn't be where we are if it wasn't for your leadership and your great cruise leadership.
[01:06:03.106 --> 01:06:06.969]  But when you say that POTUS has seen this and is pissed off, that's big news in and of itself.
[01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:13.733]  So, you know, the fact is, there's not just evil in this universe, there's the whistleblowers, there's your organization, there's what we're all doing together.
[01:06:14.411 --> 01:06:18.694]  Well they're trying to, and Alex, they're trying to curry favor with Trump.
[01:06:18.734 --> 01:06:24.577]  That's what Facebook wants to become, buddy-buddy, and they haven't tried to curry favor with me, I can tell you that.
[01:06:24.877 --> 01:06:26.318]  We're very independent here.
[01:06:26.678 --> 01:06:28.019]  Oh, they're keeping their enemy closer.
[01:06:28.059 --> 01:06:29.000]  I'm sure Trump gets that.
[01:06:29.844 --> 01:06:36.966]  Yes, I've read reports that they're whining and dining Trump in the White House, but the bottom line is I think he's seen, he has seen this.
[01:06:37.146 --> 01:06:40.628]  I think this will probably upset him and will tell him the truth.
[01:06:40.708 --> 01:06:44.569]  That this is the biggest election meddling you've ever seen and our call to action is
[01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:48.272]  They will do this more intensely as we get closer to November.
[01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:50.574]  And we just want people to tell their stories.
[01:06:50.594 --> 01:06:54.377]  We're one of the only places that people can come to with videotape.
[01:06:54.417 --> 01:06:55.398]  We give them the cameras.
[01:06:55.438 --> 01:06:56.199]  We have their back.
[01:06:56.279 --> 01:06:59.542]  Zach has a GoFundMe page set up for him.
[01:06:59.562 --> 01:07:04.046]  It's important to support whistleblowers so they're honored and promoted and aren't scared.
[01:07:04.066 --> 01:07:05.307]  How do people find that, Zach?
[01:07:06.488 --> 01:07:10.672]  Oh, that's GoFundMe.com slash Expose Facebook.
[01:07:10.732 --> 01:07:12.013]  Expose Facebook is the page.
[01:07:14.747 --> 01:07:16.508]  Let me just say this right now to both of you.
[01:07:17.129 --> 01:07:19.410]  There isn't more important work going on, period.
[01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:25.353]  And the word of mouth sharing the articles at Project Veritas, sharing the live feed at InfoWars right now is so critical.
[01:07:25.694 --> 01:07:32.097]  And all Trump needs to know is, go try to promote a Project Veritas clip on Facebook, you'll get blocked, you'll get banned.
[01:07:32.457 --> 01:07:35.019]  Go try to promote a Trump clip, they'll ban it.
[01:07:35.139 --> 01:07:36.360]  I mean, hell, Twitter just banned
[01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:38.396]  A bunch of Trump stuff.
[01:07:38.476 --> 01:07:39.677]  It's outrageous.
[01:07:39.737 --> 01:07:41.218]  James O'Keefe may have to leave.
[01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:41.938]  If he does, that's fine.
[01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:42.419]  I understand.
[01:07:42.739 --> 01:07:43.400]  He's got videos.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.401]  He's commanding a whole operation as a general.
[01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:48.443]  But if Zach McElroy can hold over, that'd be great as well.
[01:07:48.884 --> 01:07:49.824]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:49.904 --> 01:07:52.046]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWires.com.
[01:07:52.687 --> 01:07:54.428]  We'll see if I can entice him.
[01:07:54.448 --> 01:07:54.948]  He's got to go.
[01:07:55.228 --> 01:07:55.829]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:56.269]  Stay with us.
[01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:02.214]  You know, the best part about my 26 years on air is all the people I've got to meet.
[01:08:03.931 --> 01:08:08.353]  Sometimes I've sat there driving on a long road trip, thought about the things we've done together.
[01:08:09.574 --> 01:08:10.394]  All the people I met.
[01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:20.018]  From Charlton Heston to the head of Air Force Weapons Development to Buzz Aldrin.
[01:08:21.919 --> 01:08:23.119]  The list just keeps going from there.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.621]  The Hollywood people aren't even on the list.
[01:08:29.462 --> 01:08:32.884]  But on the list of people I'm proud to know are those whistleblowers.
[01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:37.871]  Are the people that lost their career, their job, everything, to tell the truth.
[01:08:38.711 --> 01:08:40.851]  One of those people is Zach McElroy.
[01:08:42.392 --> 01:08:53.734]  Facebook Insider goes there, works there, gets in, and is there with high-level managers that are bragging about the systematic discrimination against people that wear a MAGA hat.
[01:08:54.194 --> 01:08:58.755]  And we've had earlier Project Veritas videos where Twitter employees are like, well, who do you ban?
[01:08:58.895 --> 01:09:00.175]  Well, they like Alex Jones.
[01:09:00.215 --> 01:09:01.016]  He's the number one enemy.
[01:09:01.276 --> 01:09:02.336]  Or an American flag.
[01:09:02.516 --> 01:09:03.096]  Or a veteran.
[01:09:06.138 --> 01:09:10.481]  Don't you know it's folks that are veterans and care about the American flag that literally hold the country together?
[01:09:10.721 --> 01:09:12.002]  But so these people see that as a threat.
[01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:13.022]  They want power.
[01:09:13.142 --> 01:09:13.843]  They want control.
[01:09:14.403 --> 01:09:20.227]  They see an active, informed, engaged person who could be white, who could be black, who could be Hispanic, who could be Asian.
[01:09:20.807 --> 01:09:24.610]  They see that person as a threat because they got their life squared away.
[01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:27.792]  And they just think if we could tear it down, we could run it.
[01:09:29.895 --> 01:09:38.103]  And so, Zach, I can ask a lot of questions in this segment about you going public in the Big Veritas video and the President seeing it and where this is going and the proof of their perjury.
[01:09:38.183 --> 01:09:40.065]  I mean, this is Death Star Plan level stuff.
[01:09:40.565 --> 01:09:42.907]  This is probably the biggest tech whistleblowing stuff yet.
[01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:46.711]  But what are points you want to impart to viewers and listeners?
[01:09:48.493 --> 01:09:50.454]  Oh, impart some points.
[01:09:50.534 --> 01:09:53.818]  I think it's really important to keep in mind how important
[01:09:54.494 --> 01:09:57.476]  Tech censorship is how important free speech on the Internet is.
[01:09:58.076 --> 01:10:08.102]  And don't forget, you know, you've got people at this company and other companies like this that do this job who are essentially in control of the digital town square.
[01:10:08.182 --> 01:10:19.509]  You know, they are what you say and what you can and can't say is essentially at the hands of people who are employed in mostly left-leaning liberal states.
[01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:23.011]  Almost all of them are left-leaning and they're in charge.
[01:10:23.433 --> 01:10:24.634]  of what you can and can't say.
[01:10:24.934 --> 01:10:25.434]  Remember that.
[01:10:25.494 --> 01:10:28.396]  And I have to say that I thank you for your kind words.
[01:10:28.676 --> 01:10:30.117]  I am proud to be an insider.
[01:10:30.557 --> 01:10:38.641]  I think the biggest, the best quote, I just love Project Veritas' quote, be brave, do something, because that's what it takes.
[01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.804]  Again, if I jump in, you'll never get a word in edgewise.
[01:10:43.864 --> 01:10:45.705]  I agree.
[01:10:46.065 --> 01:10:47.706]  Give us your data dump, what you want to impart.
[01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.990]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.691]  You want a data dump?
[01:10:49.711 --> 01:10:52.733]  You want me to talk about some of the more egregious bits of censorship?
[01:10:52.753 --> 01:11:04.482]  Well, I could ask that or, since you're asking, since you're begging the question, the mindset of the chicken crap dimension behavior of vitriolically getting off on suppressing people.
[01:11:04.582 --> 01:11:10.707]  I mean, I would feel like a sack of garbage if I was behaving like that.
[01:11:12.093 --> 01:11:14.096]  Well, I guess I can't speak to that because I'm not like that.
[01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:19.506]  You know, I guess I can't say what it's like to have such, as you said, vitriol for people who you disagree with.
[01:11:19.846 --> 01:11:21.830]  Because I just don't, I don't know, I just don't do that.
[01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:26.057]  I think all these ideologically driven actions and motives
[01:11:26.622 --> 01:11:26.842]  Are you
[01:11:48.584 --> 01:11:49.785]  By their own standards.
[01:12:09.338 --> 01:12:09.878]  We're good to go.
[01:12:32.297 --> 01:12:41.604]  Shortly after that, I think there was some Iranian politician that had put a bounty on Donald Trump's head, very famously, for many millions of dollars.
[01:12:41.704 --> 01:12:51.930]  And we saw, in response to that, we saw a trend of people posting a map, a picture of a map, and they drew an arrow, and they said, Dear Iran, this is where Trump is.
[01:12:51.970 --> 01:12:53.071]  He's on the golf course.
[01:12:53.451 --> 01:13:00.156]  And it's very implicitly, very clearly espousing some sentiment agreeing with
[01:13:00.894 --> 01:13:03.175]  Basically telling Iran to assassinate the President.
[01:13:03.215 --> 01:13:05.656]  These people are basically telling Iran to assassinate the President.
[01:13:06.096 --> 01:13:09.138]  And Facebook decided to allow this.
[01:13:09.238 --> 01:13:13.060]  They said that this was not explicit enough.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.540]  This was too implicit.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:18.222]  So they allowed these posts of people pointing to Iran.
[01:13:18.242 --> 01:13:19.723]  Dear Iran, he's on the golf course.
[01:13:20.323 --> 01:13:24.845]  And essentially allowing people to agree with the President being assassinated.
[01:13:24.945 --> 01:13:28.227]  But all these other things, you've got to take all those things down, but not this.
[01:13:30.799 --> 01:13:44.047]  How do you think Facebook is internally responding to you, showing this bombshell video that we haven't gotten to, because you're here live talking about it, but it's on Infowars.com and ProjectVeritas.com?
[01:13:45.008 --> 01:13:46.869]  I can't imagine how they're responding.
[01:13:47.749 --> 01:13:48.870]  I guess we'll see in the coming days.
[01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:52.012]  I'm looking forward to a response from Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:13:52.332 --> 01:13:54.914]  I think I'm also very curious to see a response
[01:13:55.442 --> 01:13:55.862]  Congress.
[01:13:55.902 --> 01:13:58.144]  I want to see legislative action be taken about this.
[01:13:58.224 --> 01:14:00.105]  As I've said, I've got to keep hammering that home.
[01:14:00.405 --> 01:14:02.287]  Something has to be done about this.
[01:14:02.847 --> 01:14:04.328]  We have to do something.
[01:14:04.368 --> 01:14:07.730]  We have to see some pressure put on them.
[01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.852]  More than pressure, we need things to change.
[01:14:10.993 --> 01:14:12.914]  And if more people like me can come out
[01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:17.116]  And, you know, see what I did, maybe be inspired to do the same thing.
[01:14:17.456 --> 01:14:19.578]  All the better, and I think that's what it's going to take.
[01:14:19.718 --> 01:14:24.523]  I think a giant tidal wave, a tsunami of insiders will be something that... No, I agree.
[01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:32.772]  Before they get full AI in control, and they're still using human intelligence, we have to have the humans come out and expose and jackknife the entire system.
[01:14:34.082 --> 01:14:35.042]  Indeed, absolutely.
[01:14:35.102 --> 01:14:50.707]  And I'll say if you agree with what's been done and if you feel inspired and you're on the inside, you know, send an email or send a line to, I think it's VeritasTips at ProtonMail.com and definitely speak to Project Veritas.
[01:14:50.727 --> 01:14:51.427]  They'll do you right.
[01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:52.127]  They will.
[01:14:52.427 --> 01:14:53.608]  And let's expand on that.
[01:14:53.648 --> 01:14:55.068]  How do people find where you are?
[01:14:55.088 --> 01:14:58.329]  Because you're undoubtedly, have you been persecuted yet for what you've done?
[01:14:59.261 --> 01:14:59.682]  Well, not yet.
[01:14:59.722 --> 01:15:09.854]  I guess it was released this morning and a lot of people were, you know, a lot of people in our sphere of politics were very happy about it, but I think probably the people who don't like it haven't woken up yet.
[01:15:09.914 --> 01:15:12.277]  So I guess we'll have to see what they have to say about it.
[01:15:17.723 --> 01:15:23.404]  Very, very wicked, like archetypal villains giggling and laughing how they suppress people.
[01:15:23.804 --> 01:15:24.564]  Oh, you like Trump?
[01:15:24.624 --> 01:15:25.685]  I wish he was a terrorist.
[01:15:25.725 --> 01:15:26.505]  No one ever sees you.
[01:15:26.585 --> 01:15:27.225]  Ha ha ha.
[01:15:27.585 --> 01:15:29.245]  I mean, it's very frightening, actually.
[01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.266]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:35.306]  I mean, you know, these are, like I said, these are people that's, that's just the, that's just the culture.
[01:15:35.346 --> 01:15:36.967]  And I can't, I can't speak for it.
[01:15:37.007 --> 01:15:38.267]  I'm not that kind of person.
[01:15:38.347 --> 01:15:40.668]  So it's been really a reveal.
[01:15:40.728 --> 01:15:42.968]  And they're all just SJW one-upping each other.
[01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:45.650]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:49.914]  I think they're all, you know, it's just their politics, I guess.
[01:15:49.974 --> 01:15:50.974]  What else can I say?
[01:15:50.994 --> 01:15:55.658]  How do they feel, like you said, like they're the victim, so they've got to rape us?
[01:15:55.938 --> 01:15:58.901]  It's like, I'm the victim, I'm the trillion dollar company, so I'm going to rape you.
[01:16:01.403 --> 01:16:02.343]  I couldn't speak for that.
[01:16:02.404 --> 01:16:03.564]  It's just all very egregious.
[01:16:03.604 --> 01:16:06.427]  It's all very, it's also tiresome.
[01:16:07.087 --> 01:16:10.070]  How do people find you online, Zach McElroy?
[01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:12.932]  Yeah, so my Twitter is ZachMcElroy.
[01:16:13.410 --> 01:16:16.771]  That's with an H-C-A-C-H-M-C-E.
[01:16:17.271 --> 01:16:18.812]  That's my Twitter, ZachMCE.
[01:16:19.032 --> 01:16:23.994]  I've also got a Telegram channel, which is linked on there, and, you know, it's a very, it's very trying times.
[01:16:24.074 --> 01:16:30.136]  They laid us all off in late February, and then COVID hit, and we haven't, we've been having some difficulties.
[01:16:30.176 --> 01:16:34.838]  So, the team has been so supportive, and in the wake of this story, we've actually set up a GoFundMe.
[01:16:34.898 --> 01:16:35.879]  I'm very humbled.
[01:16:35.919 --> 01:16:37.399]  It's not something that I ever really want to do.
[01:16:37.439 --> 01:16:37.999]  I like to earn my living.
[01:16:38.019 --> 01:16:38.780]  Brother, you've only raised $3,000.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.160]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:43.081]  Oh yeah, that's Zach with an H-M-C-E and the GoFundMe is GoFundMe.com slash Expose Facebook.
[01:16:43.101 --> 01:16:43.641]  Thank you so much.
[01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:12.139]  I will be right back with the proof that wearing mask is not mandatory.
[01:17:12.539 --> 01:17:13.259]  You don't want to miss this.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.902]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have more big guests coming up today.
[01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:23.544]  Not just James O'Keefe and Gavin McGinnis and the big Facebook whistleblower, but more.
[01:17:24.425 --> 01:17:25.605]  We'll reveal that next hour.
[01:17:26.926 --> 01:17:33.469]  But I have been in conversations with neighbors and friends and family.
[01:17:35.506 --> 01:17:40.469]  And I tell them, you know, the establishment always creates loopholes for themselves.
[01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:45.232]  Like, you know, the owners of Apple and Google pay almost no tax.
[01:17:46.973 --> 01:17:47.734]  Zero corporate.
[01:17:50.135 --> 01:17:53.037]  I mean, you know, they've all got armed guards and guns, but they don't want you to have a gun.
[01:17:53.878 --> 01:17:56.600]  You know, they get clean vaccines, you get contaminated dirty ones.
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:57.980]  I can show you the London Guardian.
[01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.523]  And even friends and family go, Alex,
[01:18:02.998 --> 01:18:08.001]  There's no waiver in California or Texas or other states that you don't have to wear a mask in a store.
[01:18:11.123 --> 01:18:17.587]  And then I pull it up and I say, California dot gov.
[01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:24.291]  And they go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like Porky Pig.
[01:18:25.962 --> 01:18:28.444]  Of course they can't make you wear this.
[01:18:29.744 --> 01:18:44.433]  A, the study show doesn't protect you from COVID-19, and then COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated, and they list all the regular deaths from other things on COVID-19, and it was 22 times less deaths than they said they would, and Bill Gates put out the main test all over the world that give false positives.
[01:18:44.573 --> 01:18:48.335]  I mean, it's fraud on fraud on fraud.
[01:18:48.695 --> 01:18:50.557]  You see a pile of dog manure in your yard,
[01:18:51.497 --> 01:18:52.017]  You don't go.
[01:18:52.037 --> 01:18:55.560]  I wonder if that's 90% dog manure or 100%.
[01:19:01.624 --> 01:19:04.026]  The whole thing from one end to the other.
[01:19:04.146 --> 01:19:05.167]  Here's another gross example.
[01:19:05.187 --> 01:19:06.948]  You're driving down the road in the middle of West Texas.
[01:19:07.288 --> 01:19:08.289]  You see a dead deer.
[01:19:08.309 --> 01:19:09.330]  There's flies all over.
[01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:10.971]  It's obviously been dead four or five days.
[01:19:11.351 --> 01:19:11.892]  You get out.
[01:19:11.932 --> 01:19:12.512]  You look at it.
[01:19:12.852 --> 01:19:14.794]  You need to kick it over to know there's maggots in there.
[01:19:18.373 --> 01:19:19.874]  The eyeballs have been eaten by crows.
[01:19:20.815 --> 01:19:21.715]  That's not good meat.
[01:19:23.656 --> 01:19:26.118]  The whole thing's a rotten fraud.
[01:19:26.778 --> 01:19:28.779]  Every aspect, every angle.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:36.464]  And they sent people that had pneumonia or the flu to nursing homes to kill the old people to get their numbers up.
[01:19:36.484 --> 01:19:40.547]  And it turns out now 59%, according to the NIH, they don't even hide it.
[01:19:41.387 --> 01:19:47.251]  Of the death of COVID-19, out of 110,000 are people in nursing homes they killed!
[01:19:51.633 --> 01:19:59.515]  But family members, they couldn't visit because they didn't want you to see them killing them and getting that $52,000 bounty.
[01:20:04.076 --> 01:20:15.058]  The masks are about compliance for the forced inoculations and for the COVID-19 tracking tracing that's coming out on the cell phones run by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:20:17.714 --> 01:20:19.095]  And the Clinton Global Initiative.
[01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:21.696]  I'm going to show you USA Today in a moment saying that.
[01:20:22.396 --> 01:20:22.776]  That's right.
[01:20:22.796 --> 01:20:32.260]  The Clintons with Big Tech, with Apple and Google, with Bill Gates, are going to run the system that tracks where you go and what you do and where you can eat and what jobs you can have.
[01:20:33.621 --> 01:20:43.365]  And they say, if you just take the vaccine, we'll have your little icon on your phone say you're in like Flynn.
[01:20:44.026 --> 01:20:44.786]  Talk about a cult.
[01:20:47.725 --> 01:20:55.391]  The good news is Gates tried to come out as our savior, like the pervert, you know, coming into the little girl's room and she said, mommy, rapist.
[01:20:56.132 --> 01:20:58.754]  So he kind of crept out of the room now because people didn't buy it.
[01:20:59.435 --> 01:21:00.135]  And that's the thing.
[01:21:00.175 --> 01:21:04.338]  They think they've got all the control, but they've got missing pieces because they're Satanists.
[01:21:05.499 --> 01:21:07.641]  But let's go ahead for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:08.422]  I'll go over this for you.
[01:21:08.722 --> 01:21:12.025]  Let's go over the color of law fraud.
[01:21:12.425 --> 01:21:13.426]  These petty tyrants.
[01:21:17.213 --> 01:21:29.719]  The governor of California sets the precedent, and I told you other states would follow, and then Governor Greg Abbott is now literally the mini-me of Governor Psycho Newsom.
[01:21:30.739 --> 01:21:31.780]  He followed his orders.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:35.882]  So Texas is not just being colonized by Californian rejects now.
[01:21:36.522 --> 01:21:39.103]  We are now under Governor Newsom.
[01:21:39.163 --> 01:21:42.925]  Governor Gavin Newsom is the governor of Texas.
[01:21:44.155 --> 01:21:50.799]  The governor resigned earlier yesterday and has appointed the California governor as our governor.
[01:21:51.019 --> 01:21:52.040]  I mean, he might as well.
[01:21:53.941 --> 01:21:57.903]  His earlier instincts were right that it's all a hoax, but not now because he can grandstand.
[01:21:59.244 --> 01:22:02.907]  So here's California Department of Public Safety, June 18, 2020.
[01:22:04.227 --> 01:22:05.128]  That's five days ago.
[01:22:06.349 --> 01:22:08.150]  Guidance for use of face coverings.
[01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:09.591]  It's all guidance.
[01:22:09.651 --> 01:22:10.371]  It's not a law.
[01:22:10.691 --> 01:22:11.372]  It's all a con.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:18.641]  The following individuals are exempt from wearing a face covering persons age 2 or years under.
[01:22:20.253 --> 01:22:25.234]  Persons with a medical condition, mental health condition, or disability that prevents wearing a mask covering.
[01:22:25.254 --> 01:22:27.895]  You have anxiety, you have asthma, you're exempt.
[01:22:28.175 --> 01:22:38.957]  This equals persons with a medical condition for whom wearing a face covering would obstruct breathing or who are unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove a face covering without assistance.
[01:22:39.737 --> 01:22:47.539]  Persons who are hearing impaired are communicating with a person who is hearing impaired where the ability to see the mouth is essential.
[01:22:47.779 --> 01:22:48.539]  She's telling you're deaf.
[01:22:50.097 --> 01:22:58.545]  Persons for whom wearing a face covering would create a risk to the person related to the work, as determined by local, state, federal, and regulations and WorkSafe guidelines.
[01:22:59.546 --> 01:23:01.008]  Yeah, they just passed a law in California.
[01:23:01.028 --> 01:23:03.490]  You're exempt if you're brown from wearing a mask.
[01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:04.511]  I'm not joking.
[01:23:04.551 --> 01:23:05.052]  I'll show it to you.
[01:23:05.572 --> 01:23:12.179]  Persons who are obtaining a service involving the nose or face for temporary removal of the face covering is necessary to perform the service.
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.345]  I was trying to get my hair cut the other day and they said, oh, you need to wear a, I said, I want my beard trimmed.
[01:23:17.365 --> 01:23:20.308]  And they said, literally on the phone, they said, well, you got to wear a mask.
[01:23:20.368 --> 01:23:21.369]  I said, I'll do it myself.
[01:23:21.449 --> 01:23:21.830]  And I did.
[01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.613]  With clippers and a comb.
[01:23:27.316 --> 01:23:31.401]  Persons are seated in a restaurant, other establishment that offers food or beverages.
[01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:34.209]  So you can eat.
[01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:36.611]  I remember watching women with burkas eat under their burka.
[01:23:37.091 --> 01:23:41.734]  Persons who are engaged in outdoor work or recreation such as swimming, walking, hiking.
[01:23:41.834 --> 01:23:44.195]  Oh, if I want to swim, I don't have to wear a mask?
[01:23:44.235 --> 01:23:44.815]  Thank you!
[01:23:45.956 --> 01:23:49.438]  Rob Dew was out at Crousey Springs this weekend, outside Austin.
[01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:52.059]  People were wearing masks in the natural pool.
[01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:55.441]  Continue, sir.
[01:23:57.222 --> 01:24:00.684]  Persons who are incarcerated, prisons or jails.
[01:24:01.305 --> 01:24:01.805]  And it goes on.
[01:24:02.864 --> 01:24:04.344]  So there's California, okay?
[01:24:05.425 --> 01:24:09.986]  There's no law, it's a guideline, it's all a fraud, and it doesn't protect you.
[01:24:11.387 --> 01:24:13.447]  So when he says it's the law, do it, it's made up.
[01:24:13.627 --> 01:24:15.168]  By the way, the homeless are also exempt.
[01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:17.009]  Let's look at Austin.
[01:24:17.649 --> 01:24:18.289]  Look at Texas.
[01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:27.632]  Here is the COVID-19 Guidelines and Order of Travis County off the state law.
[01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:35.171]  Section B, face covering.
[01:24:35.852 --> 01:24:42.597]  When leaving one's residence, all persons over the age of 10 should wear some covering over the mouth and homemade mask, scarf, bandanas.
[01:24:42.637 --> 01:24:44.038]  It's all just a submission deal.
[01:24:44.739 --> 01:24:48.041]  Alone in a separate single space, whether indoor or outdoor.
[01:24:49.662 --> 01:24:54.146]  Two, in the presence only of members of one's household or residence should you take it off.
[01:24:54.386 --> 01:24:55.307]  Total call control.
[01:24:56.187 --> 01:25:02.052]  When posed a greater mental, physical health, safety, and security risk.
[01:25:03.134 --> 01:25:04.955]  So it goes on to say if you have a mental problem, you don't have to.
[01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:14.221]  For purposes of eating or drinking, wearing face covering is not a substitute for maintaining six feet, social distancing, hand washing, and all the rest of their garbage.
[01:25:14.282 --> 01:25:15.002]  It's a total cult.
[01:25:15.022 --> 01:25:17.284]  So just think of it, mentally hurts you, you don't have to.
[01:25:18.277 --> 01:25:19.258]  This is a joke.
[01:25:19.598 --> 01:25:21.699]  They don't care if it's a scarf.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.561]  They don't care if it's a face mask.
[01:25:24.682 --> 01:25:25.642]  It's a lie!
[01:25:26.243 --> 01:25:33.608]  It's that when we tell you to take a vaccine or we tell you to be tracked digitally by your cell phone, you do it.
[01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:38.872]  And that's all this is.
[01:25:39.972 --> 01:25:44.896]  And so the phobia we have of these is the tyranny of the centralized control.
[01:25:46.894 --> 01:25:53.635]  And of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and all their billions buying off the media and others, even independent media, to spout these lies.
[01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:59.477]  Apple and Google release coronavirus contact tracing technology for public health mobile apps.
[01:25:59.877 --> 01:26:01.217]  USA Today.
[01:26:02.477 --> 01:26:03.317]  And who runs it?
[01:26:04.938 --> 01:26:16.080]  George Soros and Chelsea Clinton on the board of the group that will track you in live time and then decide if you can buy or sell with a social credit score.
[01:26:18.564 --> 01:26:18.944]  Wow.
[01:26:19.845 --> 01:26:23.767]  These monsters never give up because they're not just raping kids at Epstein Island.
[01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:33.994]  They want to rape your health care, your future, your pension fund, your life, and they want you in a database they control having to submit to them for the right to even do business or live your life.
[01:26:34.234 --> 01:26:35.195]  Incredible.
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:38.181]  COVID-19's a hoax.
[01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:40.562]  They used the regular deaths in the column.
[01:26:40.802 --> 01:26:43.243]  It was 22 times lower than what they said the death rate would be.
[01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:45.624]  And now they're back to kill the election with it.
[01:26:45.944 --> 01:26:47.384]  It's the globalists making their move.
[01:26:47.604 --> 01:26:54.187]  And anybody back in mask, anybody back in the lockdown, is a new world order agent sworn to destroy this country.
[01:26:54.387 --> 01:26:55.928]  China's been open for months for business.
[01:26:57.295 --> 01:27:01.879]  But the bad news is they've got other new COVID viruses they're gonna release as real bioweapons.
[01:27:02.239 --> 01:27:07.644]  And everybody groveling to this has set the stage for them to release mass culling weapons to kill you and your family.
[01:27:08.525 --> 01:27:14.730]  But thanks to your support and your prayers, we're still on air in defense of liberty and resistance to tyranny.
[01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:19.694]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:27:20.155 --> 01:27:24.558]  Jay Dyer, smart fellow, will be joining us coming up.
[01:27:25.492 --> 01:27:27.213]  Right after this first segment.
[01:27:28.054 --> 01:27:36.041]  But I wanted to head a story that just went live on InfoWars.com that only gets leggy weggies and has an effect.
[01:27:36.101 --> 01:27:37.702]  It actually fights when you spread it.
[01:27:39.184 --> 01:27:45.189]  Texas Governor Abbott capitulates to California and pushes Masked of the Beast to buy and sell.
[01:27:47.170 --> 01:27:50.071]  So that no one can buy or sell unless they have the mask.
[01:27:50.191 --> 01:27:54.212]  And it's all just the mark that you're going to have the digital currency.
[01:27:54.232 --> 01:27:56.733]  You're going to have the digital track and tracing on your phone.
[01:27:58.374 --> 01:28:01.194]  They can get you to stay in your house for a few months and now wear a mask.
[01:28:01.655 --> 01:28:04.515]  They've just got you for the greater good doing what you're told.
[01:28:04.756 --> 01:28:07.917]  And Bill Gates says, you won't be able to go out until you take the vaccine.
[01:28:08.877 --> 01:28:10.077]  Very important article.
[01:28:10.957 --> 01:28:11.918]  I hope the dog hunts.
[01:28:13.698 --> 01:28:15.739]  But the dog only hunts when you take action.
[01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:24.330]  But wow, so much more to get to, you know, Andrew Jackson.
[01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:28.913]  We're going to play some of these clips here.
[01:28:28.933 --> 01:28:30.454]  You guys just pick which ones are so many.
[01:28:32.696 --> 01:28:44.304]  Like you go watch the movie, Conan the Barbarian, and you know, it's fantasy written in Texas back in the depression and by heavyweight boxer.
[01:28:44.324 --> 01:28:47.046]  And he comes off as not real.
[01:28:48.197 --> 01:28:54.625]  When you read about Andrew Jackson and the real stuff he did in his life, it's like he was in the Revolutionary War at age 9, killed people by 10.
[01:28:55.547 --> 01:28:58.530]  Mother, brother, everybody died in a British concentration camp.
[01:28:59.151 --> 01:29:01.935]  And just his whole life, getting stabbed, shot, nobody could kill him.
[01:29:02.255 --> 01:29:03.176]  The guy was like a zombie.
[01:29:04.267 --> 01:29:10.373]  And he literally expanded the United States, beat the British again, did all this stuff, and they want to tear down a statue.
[01:29:11.133 --> 01:29:14.877]  When he built all of this, whether you like it or not, this is Andrew Jackson.
[01:29:15.477 --> 01:29:16.739]  Like, you run the country now.
[01:29:16.819 --> 01:29:17.860]  Why do you want to tear it down?
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.861]  But it's an idea that people hate it.
[01:29:20.542 --> 01:29:22.924]  But finally, Trump stood up against it.
[01:29:22.964 --> 01:29:25.807]  Here's some of those video clips of the hysteria last night.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.102]  And again, they're saying he killed brown people.
[01:29:36.142 --> 01:29:36.982]  He killed white people, too.
[01:29:38.564 --> 01:29:40.986]  So again, the idea is, it's that he's white, why they want it torn down.
[01:29:41.006 --> 01:29:42.808]  Well, why are you trying to get in the country, then?
[01:29:42.828 --> 01:29:44.669]  I mean, it's so bad.
[01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:57.761]  I mean, this is the big accomplishment, is to pull down Andrew Jackson.
[01:30:02.085 --> 01:30:04.267]  I thought Andrew Jackson would be embarrassed of that statue.
[01:30:04.287 --> 01:30:05.208]  He didn't even like stuff like that.
[01:30:05.228 --> 01:30:07.190]  He'd be like, hey, I'm dead and gone.
[01:30:07.210 --> 01:30:07.950]  I already did what I did.
[01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:08.691]  You didn't even pull me down.
[01:30:10.112 --> 01:30:11.093]  They just live off him.
[01:30:12.595 --> 01:30:14.436]  And he has, like, super invincibility.
[01:30:14.456 --> 01:30:20.201]  I mean, at the Battle of New Orleans, he was at this barricade.
[01:30:21.064 --> 01:30:22.665]  Outnumbered by the British about 3 to 1.
[01:30:23.046 --> 01:30:27.029]  And he stood up there when the men were about to give up for two days in a black cloak.
[01:30:27.069 --> 01:30:29.271]  They said the British saw it like a demonic apparition.
[01:30:29.571 --> 01:30:34.615]  And they all kept shooting at him at 300 yards for days and no one could shoot him.
[01:30:36.637 --> 01:30:43.243]  Like he got up on top, he said the British histories, on top of the barricade and let them shoot at him.
[01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:49.188]  And the British said at hundreds of yards away they could see his eyes glowing in the dark.
[01:30:54.366 --> 01:30:56.387]  Whether you believe that's true or not, they put that in the histories.
[01:30:56.667 --> 01:30:59.229]  The British didn't just write stuff into that for no reason.
[01:30:59.629 --> 01:31:00.389]  Totally freaked him out.
[01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:02.871]  So maybe he was evil!
[01:31:02.911 --> 01:31:04.752]  Hell, like some big vampire bat sitting up there?
[01:31:04.772 --> 01:31:07.794]  I mean, I don't know who Andrew Jackson really was, let me tell you.
[01:31:08.774 --> 01:31:10.035]  They don't make them like that anymore.
[01:31:13.937 --> 01:31:18.820]  So, this is what everything has been turned into, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:19.656 --> 01:31:31.626]  People build a country in total war, they try to empower the individual, and then the people that are living off that say, oh, you're not inclusive enough, and it's all a race-based psychology.
[01:31:31.646 --> 01:31:32.467]  It's totally disgusting.
[01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:44.557]  And now that they're exploiting black people for their new world order, when the liberals can't, you know, find enough black kids to abort, now AOC dresses up like Bozo the Clown and says that she's black.
[01:31:45.737 --> 01:31:46.738]  You gotta bow down to her.
[01:31:46.758 --> 01:31:49.280]  I mean, this is all a dying system.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:53.503]  So as negative as stuff is, let's just not let them take him down.
[01:31:55.065 --> 01:31:56.646]  Let's not let them take us down with them.
[01:31:59.085 --> 01:32:09.570]  On Obama and the spying situation, this idea that they were spying on your campaign, you've been asked before about what crime he would have potentially committed, but I remember you talking about- Treason.
[01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.730]  Treason.
[01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:11.451]  It's treason.
[01:32:11.491 --> 01:32:12.331]  Look, look.
[01:32:13.091 --> 01:32:16.493]  When I came out a long time ago, I said they've been spying on my campaign.
[01:32:17.153 --> 01:32:21.217]  I said they've been taping and that was in quotes, meaning a modern day version of taping.
[01:32:21.297 --> 01:32:23.159]  It's all the same thing, but a modern day version.
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:25.442]  But they've been spying on my campaign.
[01:32:25.562 --> 01:32:27.083]  I told you that a long time ago.
[01:32:27.464 --> 01:32:28.425]  Turned out I was right.
[01:32:28.505 --> 01:32:29.826]  Let's see what happens to him now.
[01:32:32.309 --> 01:32:32.849]  Durham is.
[01:32:34.251 --> 01:32:38.034]  I never met Durham because I want to stay out of it because otherwise it's going to look political.
[01:32:38.891 --> 01:32:42.992]  But Durham, as you know, is a highly respected person.
[01:32:43.733 --> 01:32:46.694]  And Bill Barr is doing a great job as Attorney General.
[01:32:47.174 --> 01:32:48.474]  Let's see what they come up with.
[01:32:49.134 --> 01:32:51.355]  But they don't have to tell me.
[01:32:51.955 --> 01:32:56.797]  All I have to do is read the papers, the insurance policy, in case
[01:32:57.839 --> 01:32:58.619]  She doesn't win.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.600]  We've got an insurance policy.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:04.921]  Well, that was all the stuff that we went through over the last, let's say, two and a half years.
[01:33:04.941 --> 01:33:05.562]  Now we caught him.
[01:33:05.862 --> 01:33:08.483]  We caught him called Struck and Paged to Two Lovers.
[01:33:10.083 --> 01:33:13.504]  Brennan and Clapper, the way they lie.
[01:33:13.564 --> 01:33:15.225]  Democrats can't stand Barack Obama.
[01:33:15.245 --> 01:33:15.485]  Comey.
[01:33:16.105 --> 01:33:16.425]  Bill Barr.
[01:33:16.445 --> 01:33:17.546]  They just... They can't stand who?
[01:33:17.566 --> 01:33:18.006]  Bill Barr.
[01:33:18.126 --> 01:33:19.807]  They just think he's... You know why?
[01:33:19.847 --> 01:33:21.367]  Because he's doing such a good job.
[01:33:21.827 --> 01:33:23.608]  Because he's law and order.
[01:33:24.605 --> 01:33:30.748]  But he's got them in his crosshairs, and now we have to see what's going to happen.
[01:33:31.048 --> 01:33:47.055]  I will say this, if it were reversed, and if the other side sat where the Oval Office, right in that chair behind the Resolute Desk, and it was the opposite, two years ago, 25 people would have been convicted, and they would be sent to jail for 50 years.
[01:33:51.403 --> 01:33:55.106]  And Trump's trying to pull us out of these wars, and so he's the bad man.
[01:33:55.186 --> 01:33:56.087]  No, I'm very proud of Trump.
[01:33:56.107 --> 01:33:56.747]  He's the real deal.
[01:33:58.349 --> 01:34:02.152]  And the whole New World Order is crashing down right now, so they're going to take us with them, but it's not going to happen.
[01:34:02.652 --> 01:34:09.018]  Jay Dyer is an author, comedian, TV presenter, known for his deep analysis of Hollywood, geopolitics, and culture.
[01:34:09.738 --> 01:34:12.460]  His graduate work focuses on psychological warfare in film.
[01:34:12.821 --> 01:34:18.846]  He's the author of two books, Esoteric Hollywood, one and two, and the co-creator and co-host of the television show Hollywood Decoded.
[01:34:19.406 --> 01:34:22.527]  He's been featured on numerous popular shows and podcasts.
[01:34:22.547 --> 01:34:25.488]  We really appreciate him coming on jaysanalysis.com.
[01:34:25.948 --> 01:34:28.428]  While he's still there, Jay Dyer on YouTube.
[01:34:28.868 --> 01:34:37.471]  So much to cover, all these big Hollywood people committing suicide, all this pedophilia coming out in the open, what's happening with Trump, the whole world.
[01:34:37.811 --> 01:34:38.771]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:40.631]  I know you've got a big audience of folks.
[01:34:40.651 --> 01:34:42.832]  We really appreciate your perspective.
[01:34:43.092 --> 01:34:46.953]  Where do you want to start first on this Tuesday, June 23rd transmission?
[01:34:48.254 --> 01:34:48.975]  Well, thanks for having me.
[01:34:49.015 --> 01:34:53.559]  We can start with what you said when I watched you back in about 2004 or 2005.
[01:34:54.119 --> 01:34:59.604]  I remember you very pointedly saying, folks, they're going to bring back human sacrifice.
[01:34:59.745 --> 01:35:04.649]  The UN, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's Aztecs.
[01:35:05.130 --> 01:35:09.193]  So I heard you say back then, and I thought that was a little off, right?
[01:35:09.253 --> 01:35:12.697]  I was already kind of conspiracy woke at the time, but I thought, surely not.
[01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:14.651]  And you know what I did, Alex?
[01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:21.377]  I went and I got at my library about 40, 50 of the elite books, and I went through them all.
[01:35:21.477 --> 01:35:22.378]  I plowed through them.
[01:35:22.959 --> 01:35:24.320]  And sure enough, you were right.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:30.366]  I actually tracked down examples of where global elitists like Arthur Kessler and goes to the machine.
[01:35:30.446 --> 01:35:31.286]  He says, you know what?
[01:35:31.727 --> 01:35:35.670]  Since everything is natural, anything that occurs is natural.
[01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:37.132]  It's all just natural process.
[01:35:38.152 --> 01:35:42.274]  All of history includes human sacrifice, cannibalism, these kinds of things.
[01:35:42.354 --> 01:35:43.354]  It's all just natural.
[01:35:43.475 --> 01:35:43.975]  There's nothing right.
[01:35:43.995 --> 01:35:48.497]  So here is one of the top Royal Society type elites literally saying everything that you said.
[01:35:48.997 --> 01:35:49.637]  So that's what I did.
[01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:51.238]  I went and I launched into all these books.
[01:35:51.338 --> 01:35:53.139]  I plowed in because you said that's what you did.
[01:35:53.259 --> 01:35:55.320]  And lo and behold, you were right.
[01:35:57.125 --> 01:36:06.091]  Let me tell you, I remember 20 years ago reading official UN documents where they said, we should bring back human sacrifice to the lower population, and we should make pedophilia the center of the new family.
[01:36:06.491 --> 01:36:08.773]  I'm not the one coming up with this, but these people are crazy.
[01:36:09.053 --> 01:36:10.354]  Where do you think it stems from?
[01:36:12.389 --> 01:36:14.731]  Well, ultimately the battle is spiritual, as you know.
[01:36:14.871 --> 01:36:18.434]  It's a cosmic, you know, primal battle between good and evil.
[01:36:18.695 --> 01:36:20.056]  Lucifer, the fallen angel.
[01:36:20.336 --> 01:36:21.877]  In fact, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[01:36:21.917 --> 01:36:36.630]  I was just reading in the last few weeks some of the psychonauts, if you're familiar with Terrence McKenna, if you're familiar with Tim Leary, you know, all these guys working at the behest of the CIA to promote the MKUltra slash mind control LSD phenomenon.
[01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:39.373]  And one thing they consistently say is that
[01:36:40.013 --> 01:36:44.474]  Like you found out when you were, you know, talking to Joe Rogan on that top podcast of all time.
[01:36:44.514 --> 01:36:48.575]  You guys were talking about the float tanks and talking to the entities.
[01:36:49.035 --> 01:36:53.277]  Well, I tracked down where they talk about that and John C. Lilly, right?
[01:36:53.317 --> 01:36:55.677]  The famous dolphin creeper, right?
[01:36:55.917 --> 01:36:57.338]  Who had a thing for dolphins.
[01:36:57.358 --> 01:37:05.300]  Well, he also worked for the ONI, worked for the CIA in doing signals research and brain chip research back in the 50s.
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:06.460]  That's why they recruited him.
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.561]  And you know what he says in his autobiography?
[01:37:08.581 --> 01:37:15.623]  He says, I went into the tanks and I went and I talked to the aliens and they told me how to come up with all this mind control.
[01:37:15.643 --> 01:37:16.943]  That's what he says in his autobiography.
[01:37:16.963 --> 01:37:21.265]  So once again, you're proven right on the most popular podcast in history.
[01:37:21.305 --> 01:37:22.485]  Well, but I mean, enough about me.
[01:37:22.565 --> 01:37:24.966]  That's the crazy part is we're not the crazy ones.
[01:37:25.566 --> 01:37:27.727]  All of big tech is on record.
[01:37:27.767 --> 01:37:32.888]  I've even talked to a few of the guys that are big names that aren't part of it, but they're like asking, can we defeat it?
[01:37:32.908 --> 01:37:34.369]  Because they're like on the fence.
[01:37:34.389 --> 01:37:35.149]  Should they join it?
[01:37:37.026 --> 01:37:40.469]  And they're literally in these meetings, they know they're talking to aliens.
[01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:44.051]  But then the aliens tell them, it's genetically imprinted on you.
[01:37:44.071 --> 01:37:44.131]  Yes.
[01:37:44.812 --> 01:37:45.732]  And so it's actually true.
[01:37:45.992 --> 01:37:50.295]  It's not just, they're not just giving us the knowledge, we've already, it's like we've done it before or something.
[01:37:50.316 --> 01:37:53.378]  It's like we're more advanced than them, or an embryonic stage.
[01:37:53.398 --> 01:37:55.079]  I haven't figured it all out, but this is crazy.
[01:37:56.198 --> 01:37:57.079]  That's what Lilly says.
[01:37:57.119 --> 01:37:59.500]  Lilly says that there's two programs in us.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.203]  He says there's a program from biology that goes back to, you know, ancient times.
[01:38:04.263 --> 01:38:14.569]  And then there's this other program that they want to install in us to override that, which is the next stage of evolution, which you talked about yesterday, I think, when you were covering the Wall Street Journal piece.
[01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:23.435]  That next stage of evolution is seen to be the Omega Point, which all of these technocrats and all of these, what would seem to be counter-establishment figures, these
[01:38:23.925 --> 01:38:26.767]  Where do you think it's going and how do you think it's going for them?
[01:38:51.118 --> 01:38:54.000]  Unfortunately, they are getting the upper hand.
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:58.222]  I just got demonetized the other day on YouTube.
[01:38:58.503 --> 01:39:08.229]  In fact, a year ago, when InfoWars was banned across all platforms, at the very same hour that you got banned, I had my entire website deleted.
[01:39:08.669 --> 01:39:10.730]  Just no warnings, no nothing, just deleted.
[01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:14.352]  Like 10 years of movie analysis, 10 years of research, just deleted.
[01:39:14.372 --> 01:39:18.395]  By the way, it's important you say that, because they used my banning as a cover for a mass banning.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.181]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:39:21.201 --> 01:39:25.044]  So it took me a month, thousands of dollars to rebuild everything that I've done for 10 years.
[01:39:25.745 --> 01:39:30.208]  I did have it backed up, but as you know, it's just a nightmare to play, you know, hopscotch.
[01:39:30.228 --> 01:39:33.451]  They want you hopping around to all these different things and you can never build up, right?
[01:39:33.471 --> 01:39:37.114]  You have to constantly... Exactly, you're always spending your time just surviving instead of winning.
[01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:38.891]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:39:39.431 --> 01:39:41.413]  And that was the technocrat plan long ago.
[01:39:41.473 --> 01:39:56.747]  I mean, I remember you mentioned Brzezinski, and I would go and I read Grand Chess Board, I read Between Two Ages, and I think what was amazing about Between Two Ages is that Brzezinski says, not only do we have to co-opt society and bring this technocracy, he even said religion.
[01:39:56.847 --> 01:40:03.193]  He said religion needs to be co-opted, we need to steer these churches into becoming basically fake fronts for
[01:40:03.717 --> 01:40:09.001]  World Council of Churches, National Council of Churches, all Rockefeller-created stuff, all in the Rockefeller's biography.
[01:40:09.101 --> 01:40:11.083]  They brag about it, right?
[01:40:11.163 --> 01:40:13.945]  Rockefeller has whole chapters on Bilderberg, on all that stuff.
[01:40:14.285 --> 01:40:17.387]  So it was all, what blew me away was that it's all in their books.
[01:40:17.728 --> 01:40:20.970]  I mean, Brzezinski has a whole section on weather warfare, right?
[01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:22.131]  And he wrote that in what, 72?
[01:40:22.191 --> 01:40:23.932]  Let me give you an example.
[01:40:24.072 --> 01:40:27.555]  I was talking to a high-level CIA guy just the other day.
[01:40:27.975 --> 01:40:29.457]  I'm not bragging about it, it's just a fact.
[01:40:30.197 --> 01:40:31.579]  And he was just telling me, I already knew all this.
[01:40:31.599 --> 01:40:36.444]  He's like, yeah, we do maneuvers going back to the 80s with just the military doing a drill.
[01:40:36.944 --> 01:40:42.210]  And we would black out the sky with the dishes we have that can create rain.
[01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:44.612]  And he goes, yeah, no, it's the local Doppler radar.
[01:40:44.652 --> 01:40:45.433]  We really control it.
[01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:49.938]  It shows you Doppler what's really going on, but it's secondary in its main function is
[01:40:50.518 --> 01:40:56.101]  Blocking out, but sometimes we gotta have jets fly over and spray it, and that way the Chinese and the Russians can't see what our drill is.
[01:40:56.562 --> 01:41:07.988]  Now, again, I already know that, but the general public doesn't get, even if somebody who's like, well, you know, high-level CIA, DARPA, whatever, but the troops all knew they were blocking it out.
[01:41:08.389 --> 01:41:18.635]  All the Green Berets out there doing the drill for, you know, grabbing nuclear weapons from the Iranians, they have a drill to raid Iranian nukes, they block the sun out for a week.
[01:41:19.395 --> 01:41:21.697]  I mean, that was in the 80s and 90s and whatever.
[01:41:22.057 --> 01:41:23.538]  We'll come right back with Jay Dyer.
[01:41:23.558 --> 01:41:26.500]  Jay is jaysanalysis.com.
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.100]  Great guy.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:27.700]  Smart guy.
[01:41:28.241 --> 01:41:29.521]  He doesn't need to pay me any more homage.
[01:41:29.541 --> 01:41:30.242]  We pay him homage.
[01:41:30.262 --> 01:41:31.002]  We pay all you homage.
[01:41:31.022 --> 01:41:32.823]  I want to hear where he thinks this is all going.
[01:41:33.184 --> 01:41:34.384]  On the other side, straight ahead.
[01:41:34.404 --> 01:41:34.845]  Stay with us.
[01:41:35.965 --> 01:41:37.106]  We got big announcements.
[01:41:37.666 --> 01:41:38.687]  Start of the next segment.
[01:41:38.727 --> 01:41:39.768]  I mean, big announcements.
[01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:43.251]  And Jay Dyer will ride shotgun with us.
[01:41:43.371 --> 01:41:47.534]  Jay Dyer has jaysanalysis.com, author, researcher.
[01:41:48.054 --> 01:41:49.295]  So get into it.
[01:41:49.635 --> 01:41:51.597]  What would you call this period of time we're living in?
[01:41:51.617 --> 01:41:56.260]  What are the big topics and issues you want to hit that you want to cover for the listeners and viewers out there?
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.502]  Because to me, this is just a crazy time.
[01:41:58.542 --> 01:42:02.685]  I see the left committing seppuku, suicide, going crazy.
[01:42:03.125 --> 01:42:04.366]  Then I see all these other forces.
[01:42:04.406 --> 01:42:05.707]  What do you think's really behind it all?
[01:42:06.991 --> 01:42:10.934]  When you talk about the Trump dimension, it's like we're entering the Manson dimension.
[01:42:10.954 --> 01:42:12.435]  You remember what Manson talked about?
[01:42:12.595 --> 01:42:16.538]  I mean, hell, we're going to have Jesus and Lucifer, the same side of things.
[01:42:17.198 --> 01:42:19.160]  Manson literally said we would have race wars.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.621]  I'm not saying Manson was a prophet.
[01:42:20.661 --> 01:42:21.702]  He was obviously a lunatic.
[01:42:21.762 --> 01:42:25.985]  But, you know, this blending of opposites, this is all alchemical.
[01:42:26.165 --> 01:42:27.586]  I was talking about Leary before.
[01:42:27.986 --> 01:42:35.892]  Leary said that the age of transition, this age that we're entering into, he said it would be an alchemical transition to an omega point.
[01:42:36.391 --> 01:42:36.931]  We're good.
[01:42:51.866 --> 01:42:52.346]  Guess what?
[01:42:52.447 --> 01:42:57.010]  Klaus has an entire chapter on which, by the way, if you talk about it, you are a lunatic.
[01:42:57.351 --> 01:43:00.253]  But Klaus has a whole chapter on geoengineering, right?
[01:43:00.293 --> 01:43:02.315]  So here is this book, Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[01:43:02.355 --> 01:43:03.276]  This is where they're going.
[01:43:03.356 --> 01:43:04.096]  This is where we are now.
[01:43:04.196 --> 01:43:04.957]  Great reset.
[01:43:04.997 --> 01:43:07.219]  They just talked about this the entire week last week.
[01:43:07.259 --> 01:43:08.120]  Great reset time.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:08.900]  This is austerity.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:12.343]  This is everything the Banking Deleted Plan for 100 years, technocracy.
[01:43:12.824 --> 01:43:18.208]  And Klaus says that the Internet of Things, nanotechnology, biotech, it's all going to roll in now.
[01:43:18.969 --> 01:43:20.150]  This is the age of transition.
[01:43:22.273 --> 01:43:24.795]  And the new vaccines are not vaccines.
[01:43:24.835 --> 01:43:26.696]  They have nanotech that reprogram our cells.
[01:43:27.196 --> 01:43:28.537]  They skipped animal trials.
[01:43:28.677 --> 01:43:29.438]  It's just here.
[01:43:30.138 --> 01:43:31.439]  They're not playing games now.
[01:43:31.479 --> 01:43:32.559]  They're just moving on us.
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:34.601]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:43:34.661 --> 01:43:36.122]  I mean, remember Brave New World?
[01:43:36.142 --> 01:43:37.623]  We've all heard of this novel.
[01:43:37.903 --> 01:43:39.624]  Maybe not as many of us have read it.
[01:43:40.488 --> 01:43:43.711]  I recently read it after reading it back in high school.
[01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:45.232]  You know, you don't even know what's going on.
[01:43:45.253 --> 01:43:47.635]  And what does he say in Brave New World?
[01:43:47.675 --> 01:43:57.844]  He says that we can't have Mostafa Man, the world's socialist controller, says we can't have the masses reading Shakespeare, watching, you know, good productions.
[01:43:57.884 --> 01:44:00.386]  We've got to have this degenerate, toxic culture.
[01:44:01.035 --> 01:44:04.356]  And he says, we have to keep even the real scientific discoveries from people.
[01:44:04.376 --> 01:44:07.478]  This is what he tells John the Savage in the novel, The World Socialist Controller.
[01:44:07.498 --> 01:44:10.679]  He says, we have to do this because the people can't handle it.
[01:44:10.699 --> 01:44:11.199]  They don't care.
[01:44:11.259 --> 01:44:12.500]  They don't want to know that stuff.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.281]  So we have to dumb them down and destroy them.
[01:44:15.441 --> 01:44:16.721]  So that is a game plan.
[01:44:16.741 --> 01:44:17.802]  That is not an expose.
[01:44:17.822 --> 01:44:18.202]  That's right.
[01:44:18.222 --> 01:44:19.522]  His brother ran the UN.
[01:44:19.542 --> 01:44:21.323]  He said before he died in 62, this is our battle plan.
[01:44:24.218 --> 01:44:30.747]  Julian, Julian, which as you know coined the term transhumanism, he wrote UNESCO's philosophy.
[01:44:31.168 --> 01:44:32.550]  Go read that 50 page thing.
[01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:35.414]  All he says in there is everything that the technocrats say.
[01:44:35.434 --> 01:44:38.238]  He says we got to lie about everything about what we're really doing.
[01:44:38.258 --> 01:44:39.740]  We got to pretend like we're liberals.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.242]  We're going to kill everybody off.
[01:44:41.832 --> 01:44:44.214]  And he says it is eugenics, right?
[01:44:44.654 --> 01:44:47.916]  It's not eugenics in the sense of like, well, we're going to pick one master race.
[01:44:47.976 --> 01:44:55.100]  He says we're going to pick, like Moonraker, like Hugo Jackson Moonraker, we'll pick the top from the different races and just kill everybody else off.
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:58.542]  So the breakaway civilization Moonraker plan is real.
[01:44:58.883 --> 01:45:05.487]  That's exactly what my dad was told as a junior in high school with the head of the body department running a secret eugenics operation.
[01:45:05.967 --> 01:45:07.368]  He said, listen, we're not like the Nazis.
[01:45:07.388 --> 01:45:08.889]  We're just going to kill all the dumb people.
[01:45:09.568 --> 01:45:12.571]  We'll have the smart blacks, the smart whites, the smart Jews, the smart whatever.
[01:45:13.112 --> 01:45:16.615]  And, I mean, these people really have a plan and they're running things.
[01:45:17.075 --> 01:45:18.437]  So how do you think your plan's going?
[01:45:20.097 --> 01:45:23.818]  Well, unfortunately right now they've moved, they have rolled out a lot of the technocracy.
[01:45:23.859 --> 01:45:32.682]  I mean, if you look at the way the Fortune 100, Fortune 500, they have coordinated efforts that have gone on for the last several years globally.
[01:45:32.722 --> 01:45:39.305]  You see things culturally roll out and the entire corporate establishment across the world promotes it everywhere, right?
[01:45:39.345 --> 01:45:42.626]  All the banking, all the elite, they promote the same things.
[01:45:42.746 --> 01:45:44.927]  COVID was a great example of this, right?
[01:45:44.947 --> 01:45:47.188]  This Karanka virus, coup fit hoax.
[01:45:47.728 --> 01:45:57.973]  Well, I could ask the questions here, but you're definitely over the target.
[01:45:57.993 --> 01:46:03.435]  What do you think they're going to pull next?
[01:46:03.515 --> 01:46:05.256]  Because they've pulled a lot of stuff lately.
[01:46:05.336 --> 01:46:09.037]  It seems like 2020 is kind of a metaphysical, esoteric year for them.
[01:46:10.118 --> 01:46:10.978]  Yeah, great point.
[01:46:11.318 --> 01:46:12.339]  I noticed that the
[01:46:13.047 --> 01:46:18.650]  Patterns of what we've seen in 2020 tended to be election-based, politics-focused.
[01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:26.655]  You know, they're calling for this coup against Trump, but publicly Biden does it, fumbling over his words, stumbling, can hardly talk.
[01:46:27.255 --> 01:46:31.278]  And then we see the CFR write that article about how it's time for the military to please
[01:46:31.758 --> 01:46:32.479]  Get rid of this guy.
[01:46:32.519 --> 01:46:32.939]  Take him out.
[01:46:32.979 --> 01:46:34.821]  This definitely needs to happen for justice, right?
[01:46:35.301 --> 01:46:39.885]  So, a lot of this is election focused, but a lot of people are focused only on the election.
[01:46:39.945 --> 01:46:48.712]  I always try to stay focused on the big picture, and the big picture is to roll out this next phase, this next business plan phase of the technocracy, right?
[01:46:48.852 --> 01:46:49.933]  UBI, all of that.
[01:46:49.993 --> 01:46:53.316]  I just came across an entire essay by one of the technocrats.
[01:46:53.596 --> 01:46:55.478]  I know you know about changing images.
[01:46:55.558 --> 01:46:56.979]  Man, remember Willis Harman?
[01:46:57.908 --> 01:47:11.454]  In 1981, he wrote an essay about how they would have essential and non-essential workers that you would have to demonstrate your viability and usefulness to the collective to even have work or to have possessions, right?
[01:47:11.474 --> 01:47:12.435]  You're not going to have a car.
[01:47:12.735 --> 01:47:13.716]  You're not going to have a phone.
[01:47:13.736 --> 01:47:17.757]  You're going to have to demonstrate that you need those things for the society, for the collective.
[01:47:17.777 --> 01:47:19.738]  You'll be given a purpose, right?
[01:47:20.199 --> 01:47:25.181]  And in 1981, he said that UBI social credit system would be rolled out with essential and non-essential workers.
[01:47:27.042 --> 01:47:27.542]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:47:27.603 --> 01:47:30.445]  And that's what Bill Gates is openly doing with his new education.
[01:47:30.485 --> 01:47:30.906]  Exactly.
[01:47:31.386 --> 01:47:33.488]  Imagine the ultimate racism level.
[01:47:33.508 --> 01:47:39.674]  Not what color you are, but this elite, foggy computer decides if you're essential or not.
[01:47:41.434 --> 01:47:52.844]  Yeah, remember Tragedy and Hope, a lot of people talk about the later chapter where Quigley goes into the banking elite and the Rockefeller Foundation, all these different groups, funding the leftist movements.
[01:47:52.884 --> 01:48:00.650]  That's very important, but a lot of people forget right smack in the middle of the book, there is the chapter on the managerial society, the managerial technocracy.
[01:48:01.271 --> 01:48:03.833]  And even in that chapter, Quigley back in the 60s, right?
[01:48:03.893 --> 01:48:09.698]  He was basically writing this book, exposing the CFR's entire approach to world government
[01:48:10.504 --> 01:48:11.345]  He was at Georgetown.
[01:48:11.385 --> 01:48:12.486]  He was Bill Clinton's mentor.
[01:48:12.526 --> 01:48:13.807]  This is a key book.
[01:48:13.907 --> 01:48:14.567]  It's crucial.
[01:48:14.907 --> 01:48:17.789]  I've lectured through all 1,300 pages if people want to go see my lectures.
[01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:23.354]  And what he says is that there will be basically AI in cities running everything.
[01:48:23.394 --> 01:48:30.519]  You'll live in, just like you've talked about, white box, you know, barren cities of computers running everything.
[01:48:31.121 --> 01:48:33.042]  It would be like living in a Walmart.
[01:48:33.222 --> 01:48:35.183]  You're going to live on the aisle of Walmart.
[01:48:35.263 --> 01:48:37.525]  You're going to live on French fry aisle or something, right?
[01:48:37.945 --> 01:48:45.689]  And your neighbors are going to, but you're going to be like just this, you know, glob of a human, this test tube, gub, gub, snail man, you know, micro machines.
[01:48:45.729 --> 01:48:51.452]  That constantly has the virtue of sitting on like a chicken or a pigeon pecking the deal to get a piece of grain.
[01:48:52.193 --> 01:48:56.375]  It's all just like a Pavlovian ritual where you're in a box saying peck, peck, peck.
[01:48:58.056 --> 01:48:58.536]  Exactly.
[01:48:59.197 --> 01:48:59.737]  Yeah, I mean.
[01:49:00.869 --> 01:49:06.294]  Um, I think what's really mind-blowing is that it's not in one book.
[01:49:06.934 --> 01:49:08.295]  It's in every one of their books.
[01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:10.317]  Well, that's the thing is they all say the same thing.
[01:49:10.337 --> 01:49:14.700]  The Wall Street Journal thing saying, dreaming of the end of humans or whatever the headline was.
[01:49:15.001 --> 01:49:16.622]  It's the same weird thing.
[01:49:16.862 --> 01:49:17.703]  It's unimaginative.
[01:49:17.723 --> 01:49:20.465]  It's just like, die, roll over, give over your humanity.
[01:49:20.485 --> 01:49:21.446]  It's the only way you live.
[01:49:21.466 --> 01:49:22.507]  It's the same message.
[01:49:22.767 --> 01:49:23.127]  Die.
[01:49:23.487 --> 01:49:24.168]  It's alien.
[01:49:24.268 --> 01:49:24.808]  It's alien.
[01:49:24.848 --> 01:49:27.811]  It's die humans, die humans, die humans, die.
[01:49:27.831 --> 01:49:29.052]  It's the same message over and over again.
[01:49:30.031 --> 01:49:31.512]  Yeah, it's the entities that rise up.
[01:49:31.572 --> 01:49:33.474]  It's the same spirit behind this, right?
[01:49:33.614 --> 01:49:36.496]  Who does Tim Leary say is the father of this era?
[01:49:36.576 --> 01:49:37.417]  He says Crowley.
[01:49:37.697 --> 01:49:38.918]  He says this in the introduction.
[01:49:39.158 --> 01:49:40.059]  He wrote the introduction.
[01:49:40.099 --> 01:49:44.803]  He says, Alistair Crowley and the talking to all the entities, that is the spirit of our age.
[01:49:45.003 --> 01:49:52.128]  Let's talk about that with Jay Dyer straight ahead and the pedophilia coming out and the religion of the evil and how we stop it.
[01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:55.251]  Coming down fast by the miles above you.
[01:49:57.346 --> 01:50:01.009]  All right, Jay Dyer is our guest, and I said I got a big announcement, and I do.
[01:50:01.530 --> 01:50:02.491]  The site just went up.
[01:50:04.032 --> 01:50:13.221]  I'm not going to sit here and take this wearing of the mask, this symbol of submission, you don't leave your house, you're non-essential, without a fight.
[01:50:13.441 --> 01:50:15.823]  And so we're going to be down there Sunday at the Texas Capitol.
[01:50:17.038 --> 01:50:26.944]  12 noon, we're going to march over to the governor's mansion and let Greg Abbott know that we didn't elect American psycho Gavin Newsom, who said you gotta wear a mask, it's the law.
[01:50:27.424 --> 01:50:33.228]  I showed people earlier, I'll show it again since I'm mentioning it, the California Health Department policy.
[01:50:33.268 --> 01:50:34.388]  It's not law, it's a fraud.
[01:50:36.029 --> 01:50:41.593]  And it says if you've got any anxiety or medical issues, no one can ask you what they are, you don't have to wear the mask.
[01:50:42.355 --> 01:50:45.478]  And I've got the Texas law and Travis County right here as well.
[01:50:46.238 --> 01:50:47.079]  And I love my crew.
[01:50:47.119 --> 01:50:47.920]  They're great people.
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.901]  But, you know, this started five, six months ago.
[01:50:49.921 --> 01:50:51.663]  I had to come in to them and say, we're essential.
[01:50:51.703 --> 01:50:52.183]  We're medium.
[01:50:52.643 --> 01:50:53.464]  Here's the federal law.
[01:50:53.984 --> 01:50:55.326]  Well, the city hadn't issued stuff yet.
[01:50:55.346 --> 01:50:55.606]  They weren't.
[01:50:55.646 --> 01:50:56.366]  We may have to leave.
[01:50:56.386 --> 01:50:57.607]  And I said, listen, I'm not lying to you.
[01:50:57.848 --> 01:50:59.209]  But I said, even this law is a fraud.
[01:51:00.450 --> 01:51:01.791]  So now we all know it's a fraud.
[01:51:01.831 --> 01:51:02.511]  It's admitted it's a fraud.
[01:51:02.551 --> 01:51:03.492]  I'm not just telling you.
[01:51:03.772 --> 01:51:07.675]  When you walk into a grocery store, don't tackle somebody like the guy trying to go into Walmart yesterday.
[01:51:08.513 --> 01:51:11.475]  Just say, hey, I have anxiety or have a medical issue.
[01:51:11.495 --> 01:51:12.876]  It's none of your business.
[01:51:12.916 --> 01:51:15.418]  Under law, under HIPAA, you're not allowed to ask.
[01:51:16.339 --> 01:51:18.060]  Lawyers leave themselves an out.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:19.741]  They know what they're doing is illegal.
[01:51:20.301 --> 01:51:22.403]  It's all color of law, like forced inoculations.
[01:51:23.003 --> 01:51:26.426]  You need to absolutely say no to this.
[01:51:28.732 --> 01:51:30.733]  In fact, let's just go ahead and play the video of this from the beginning.
[01:51:31.033 --> 01:51:32.794]  Here's a man trying to go into Walmart.
[01:51:32.814 --> 01:51:33.874]  It's got 12 million views.
[01:51:34.834 --> 01:51:37.535]  If he just had knowledge, he'd say, hey, I have anxiety.
[01:51:37.555 --> 01:51:38.476]  I have a medical condition.
[01:51:38.936 --> 01:51:39.676]  Call your manager.
[01:51:39.716 --> 01:51:40.937]  Under law, you can't block me.
[01:51:43.398 --> 01:51:44.858]  Well, you got to wear a mask, bro.
[01:51:54.182 --> 01:51:56.463]  Bro, these folks is tripping, bro.
[01:51:58.012 --> 01:51:58.994]  So what's the stop right here?
[01:51:59.795 --> 01:52:00.998]  It's the equivalent of a burka.
[01:52:01.418 --> 01:52:05.305]  So, we have launched, and the site just went live.
[01:52:07.045 --> 01:52:09.546]  WeCan'tBreathe.news.
[01:52:09.586 --> 01:52:10.646]  You've heard, I can't breathe.
[01:52:10.806 --> 01:52:12.087]  We're against what happened to George Floyd.
[01:52:12.727 --> 01:52:14.407]  WeCan'tBreathe.news.
[01:52:15.207 --> 01:52:17.648]  And I'm gonna shoot a video as soon as the show's over, post it there.
[01:52:18.068 --> 01:52:29.752]  We've got our 10 points of why it's dangerous, how it doesn't protect you, how it's a fraud, how it's getting you ready for contact tracing and apps on your phone to track you, how it's a big tech takeover, how it's forced inoculation, how it's about Bill Gates.
[01:52:30.192 --> 01:52:32.653]  The site's live, a lot of it, the petition's already up there.
[01:52:33.393 --> 01:52:34.855]  We've already got a couple videos up there.
[01:52:35.295 --> 01:52:36.296]  Share it with everybody you know.
[01:52:36.436 --> 01:52:38.298]  WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[01:52:39.399 --> 01:52:44.325]  And we're calling for a nationwide movement to go out and expose this hoax and this fraud.
[01:52:44.365 --> 01:52:45.546]  WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[01:52:45.566 --> 01:52:46.207]  But regardless...
[01:52:47.776 --> 01:52:48.796]  Don't be scared of Antifa.
[01:52:48.836 --> 01:52:51.677]  Be scared of letting them take over so you're not cornered in your house later.
[01:52:52.457 --> 01:52:59.999]  Everyone, this is the real Trump rally, needs to come to Austin this Sunday high noon on the south side of the Capitol on 11th Street.
[01:53:00.019 --> 01:53:01.420]  We'll march the steps of the Capitol.
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:02.680]  We don't need permits.
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:03.460]  We have the First Amendment.
[01:53:03.761 --> 01:53:08.362]  And we'll march the governor's mansion that is 200 yards away to the west.
[01:53:09.741 --> 01:53:11.763]  So again, be sure and join us.
[01:53:11.843 --> 01:53:13.484]  WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[01:53:14.065 --> 01:53:18.288]  Only way this dog hunts, this bird flies, this fish swims, is if you share that URL.
[01:53:18.368 --> 01:53:20.811]  WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[01:53:21.231 --> 01:53:22.392]  Going back to Jay Dyer.
[01:53:22.512 --> 01:53:23.273]  Jay, big picture.
[01:53:25.314 --> 01:53:33.502]  You've got alchemists, magicians, drug addicts, CIA, Aleister Crowley-ites, who believe taking DMT and other drugs
[01:53:34.608 --> 01:53:37.471]  That they're interfacing with these demons that give them these plans.
[01:53:38.052 --> 01:53:44.339]  Whether this is some genetic remnant or a real spiritual communication, regardless, scientifically, they're a death cult that's taken over.
[01:53:44.899 --> 01:53:53.168]  Your elaboration on that, and where you think it's going, and how it's going for them, and what you think they'll pull next, and what they would do if they had control, is whatever you want to talk about.
[01:53:53.188 --> 01:53:53.789]  You're a smart guy.
[01:53:53.809 --> 01:53:54.430]  I want to hear from you.
[01:53:56.075 --> 01:53:57.716]  Well, it goes back to Plato, right?
[01:53:57.756 --> 01:54:06.363]  So if we look back to Plato's Republic, and we look at what the ancient philosophers said, that's actually an elitist manual for how to govern and run society, right?
[01:54:06.443 --> 01:54:11.407]  Plato and the Greeks invented this idea, not just of eugenic regimentation,
[01:54:12.288 --> 01:54:14.650]  Uh, but also the idea of communism, right?
[01:54:14.691 --> 01:54:22.458]  The idea of the guardian class, which is at the middle of that platonic period, or a pyramid, that guardian class has everything in common, right?
[01:54:22.478 --> 01:54:27.183]  And they can pretty much do whatever they want to with the lower proletarian, you know, slave class.
[01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:34.575]  And so there's a strict view that everything has to be quantified mathematically and regimented and controlled.
[01:54:34.735 --> 01:54:37.697]  That's the origin of technocracy, of quantification.
[01:54:38.197 --> 01:54:49.625]  Fast forward all the way up to Malthus and all those characters, the Galtans, the Wedgwoods, you know, you read all those people and they're just saying, look, we need to use this model to govern and control society, right?
[01:54:49.945 --> 01:54:56.390]  And so they give everybody these false paradigms, these false worldviews, these overlays that are synthetic, these fake worldviews,
[01:54:56.750 --> 01:55:05.117]  Meanwhile, they sit back as this kind of scientific priest class, which again, Leary, Jose Delgado, they all talk about themselves as the priest class.
[01:55:05.157 --> 01:55:10.341]  In fact, I was reading Jonas Salk the other day, the hero that we all think is a hero, right?
[01:55:10.541 --> 01:55:14.865]  Did you know Jonas Salk wrote a book called Survival of the Wisest, where he says that the
[01:55:15.465 --> 01:55:22.090]  Elite priest class have to step up to the picture, to the table, and commandeer evolution.
[01:55:22.130 --> 01:55:22.991]  This is what they all say.
[01:55:23.031 --> 01:55:30.497]  They say, we have to commandeer evolution to control where the species goes, and that will include mass experimentation on the human population.
[01:55:31.017 --> 01:55:31.177]  Right?
[01:55:31.538 --> 01:55:32.719]  He says that, yeah, exactly.
[01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:39.784]  And so the survival, the wisest that he's talking about there are the smart ones that Leary talks about who are the scientific priest class.
[01:55:40.184 --> 01:55:43.167]  And by the way, let's talk about just one little data point that's like the
[01:55:44.505 --> 01:55:45.205]  Thread on the sweater.
[01:55:45.766 --> 01:55:52.710]  Gates gets up in all these speeches and says, if we give an old lady cancer treatment when she's 80, we gotta fire 10 teachers.
[01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:58.014]  Well, if you know about the economy, the more service you give, the deeper the economy and the more jobs.
[01:55:58.494 --> 01:56:04.278]  Once you say someone loses for you to gain, that's not a renaissance economy, that's a conquest economy.
[01:56:04.298 --> 01:56:05.198]  Those actually implode.
[01:56:05.599 --> 01:56:09.441]  More service, more love, more altruism builds a better society.
[01:56:09.621 --> 01:56:11.903]  But the very liberals that say they want to give free stuff say,
[01:56:12.898 --> 01:56:15.279]  Kill an old lady, you get 10 jobs.
[01:56:15.399 --> 01:56:17.180]  No, you're making yourself worthless, too.
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:18.880]  They've already got robots ready for that.
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:23.922]  So just the mathematics gate says, oh, we kill an old lady.
[01:56:24.142 --> 01:56:30.945]  How is killing an old lady taken to hiring teachers?
[01:56:31.005 --> 01:56:31.965]  It's not mathematics.
[01:56:32.025 --> 01:56:33.486]  It's just a fraud he puts out.
[01:56:34.281 --> 01:56:35.803]  Yeah, it's just made up, right?
[01:56:49.261 --> 01:56:50.441]  Well, we need the science.
[01:56:50.481 --> 01:56:53.382]  Fauci says Americans don't trust science or authority.
[01:56:53.542 --> 01:56:55.463]  Well, you lied about everything about COVID!
[01:56:55.703 --> 01:56:56.924]  Why would I listen to someone?
[01:56:57.184 --> 01:57:01.265]  I go buy a car and they say it's brand new, and it burns up on the highway five minutes later.
[01:57:01.505 --> 01:57:03.446]  I buy another one, it breaks in a week.
[01:57:03.686 --> 01:57:04.646]  You're a liar!
[01:57:04.846 --> 01:57:09.748]  It's not, quote, I can't handle science, I can't handle psychotic liars.
[01:57:11.032 --> 01:57:12.814]  Yeah, it's a humiliation ritual, right?
[01:57:12.914 --> 01:57:16.718]  This is the Maoist element of this, the youth revolution.
[01:57:17.058 --> 01:57:25.767]  They would do these humiliation rituals, that's what they're doing here is co-opting Gen Z, make them into this Maoist revolutionary youth brigade, and they're all totally
[01:57:26.247 --> 01:57:27.608]  At the best of the Fortune 100.
[01:57:27.648 --> 01:57:33.710]  I mean, imagine thinking that you're fighting the system when the entire corporate establishment is giving hundreds of millions of dollars to what you're doing.
[01:57:33.730 --> 01:57:41.333]  And by the way, go back to that video of Fauci with the guy in the clown outfit, all acting official and male and powerful, when they're all just yes-men.
[01:57:41.713 --> 01:57:42.453]  Go back to that footage.
[01:57:42.633 --> 01:57:44.674]  So who's on top of this, Jay?
[01:57:46.929 --> 01:58:00.924]  Well, you have, of course, according to Quigley, the Bank for National Settlements, those powerful banking families and empires at the tip-top, and then you've got under them this sort of, the way the Anglo-American establishment by Quigley describes it, is the Society of Helpers, right?
[01:58:00.944 --> 01:58:07.350]  These are the 6,000, you know, Rothkopf book, you know, the 6,000 managerial class of the... The superclass!
[01:58:08.336 --> 01:58:16.919]  You know, the academic idiots who think that they're into this and that they're going to actually help things and, you know, they buy into the BS, basically, all of these professors.
[01:58:16.959 --> 01:58:20.201]  I mean, I had just the worst experience in college with these professors, right?
[01:58:20.961 --> 01:58:21.901]  But they all believe it, right?
[01:58:21.921 --> 01:58:22.922]  They believe their own BS.
[01:58:22.962 --> 01:58:26.543]  They think that they're going to be part of this elite class and that they're going to fix everything.
[01:58:26.563 --> 01:58:30.805]  And they don't realize that, of course, the elite helper class are the first ones to get eliminated, right?
[01:58:30.985 --> 01:58:32.946]  In any of these Stalinist revolutions, right?
[01:58:33.979 --> 01:58:35.840]  And it's funny because you read H.G.
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:37.740]  Wells, you read Bertrand Russell, they all laugh about this.
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:38.400]  They all talk about it.
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:43.161]  They're like, well, you know, obviously the traitors to the existing people, that's who we eliminate first, right?
[01:58:43.201 --> 01:58:47.643]  Because how can the coming regime, you know, trust the traitors, right?
[01:58:47.683 --> 01:58:50.443]  So that's the irony of the whole like, you know, Soviet Congress.
[01:58:50.463 --> 01:58:57.485]  Yeah, I'm not bragging about this, but I've had the globalists, they haven't tried in like seven, eight years, literally try to hire me because they know if I joined them, I'd really join.
[01:58:58.905 --> 01:59:01.366]  Like, if you joined them, I'm sure you'd actually do it.
[01:59:02.506 --> 01:59:04.507]  With their people, they're all backstabbers.
[01:59:04.887 --> 01:59:09.688]  Like, what must that be like to be around people always jockeying for a better position?
[01:59:10.188 --> 01:59:11.248]  It just sounds like a nightmare.
[01:59:11.489 --> 01:59:12.549]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:59:12.569 --> 01:59:12.949]  Stay with us.
[01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:24.472]  The establishment has put a spell on the public to cut themselves off from God and God's creation and to make us artificial slaves of the system.
[01:59:25.433 --> 01:59:26.673]  It's all really just a test.
[01:59:28.166 --> 01:59:28.947]  Break that spell.
[01:59:28.967 --> 01:59:34.432]  Anytime we reach out to the dark towards God, you'll find God on the other side.
[01:59:34.953 --> 01:59:36.794]  The article's up on Infowars.com.
[01:59:36.874 --> 01:59:46.063]  New movement hijacks I Can't Breathe meme to protest mask in public with the movement WeCan'tBreathe.news.
[01:59:46.764 --> 01:59:47.965]  Please share that link.
[01:59:48.485 --> 01:59:50.908]  Jay Dreyer is a great talk show host, comedian, author.
[01:59:53.632 --> 01:59:55.593]  We see the collapse of Hollywood.
[01:59:55.653 --> 01:59:59.173]  We see all these big producers jumping off.
[01:59:59.193 --> 02:00:01.334]  The last few days, four or five of them committing suicide.
[02:00:01.354 --> 02:00:02.974]  Others getting arrested for pedophilia.
[02:00:03.275 --> 02:00:05.035]  I mean, really, it is collapsing.
[02:00:05.535 --> 02:00:07.576]  And they're then launching all their weapons at once.
[02:00:07.676 --> 02:00:10.697]  Race war, societal collapse, COVID-19.
[02:00:10.717 --> 02:00:15.858]  But really, we should be rejoicing because this, I see, is their fault.
[02:00:19.222 --> 02:00:25.705]  A lot of my research on psychological warfare in Hollywood, and I didn't realize how much of a close connection there was between those two.
[02:00:25.765 --> 02:00:34.049]  I heard these rumors for many, many years of Ian Fleming, you know, he worked with the British Royal Navy, he was a Psy-Ops guy and all this.
[02:00:34.529 --> 02:00:43.433]  So I went and did my Master's on that and come to find out pretty much everything that you see in, say, the Bond stories is, I mean, it's Hollywooded up, but it's kind of true.
[02:00:43.453 --> 02:00:44.754]  There's elements of truth there.
[02:00:44.774 --> 02:00:46.335]  We mentioned Moonraker before.
[02:00:46.955 --> 02:00:50.997]  But a lot of these other operations were from Ian Fleming's own experiences.
[02:00:51.037 --> 02:00:52.318]  He saw this stuff, right?
[02:00:53.198 --> 02:01:00.923]  And so, yeah, I think that that's one of the key ways to understand the close connection between Hollywood and the intelligence agencies for many, many years.
[02:01:00.943 --> 02:01:02.263]  There's liaison offices, right?
[02:01:02.283 --> 02:01:03.304]  We all know this, but
[02:01:03.744 --> 02:01:15.131]  It's much deeper than we think, and now that Epstein has come out, now that we, you know, can reflect on what Kubrick said, for example, in Eyes Wide Shut, we realize that that was all real, right?
[02:01:15.171 --> 02:01:18.153]  The Eyes Wide Shut stuff wasn't, you know, some theory.
[02:01:18.173 --> 02:01:20.435]  Oh, by the way, again, I'm not bragging about this.
[02:01:20.895 --> 02:01:22.756]  I met with, for like three days, with his daughter.
[02:01:23.096 --> 02:01:25.418]  She was on record to be his main protege, the only one he trusted.
[02:01:25.918 --> 02:01:27.819]  She laid out, she said, no, no, this is all real.
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:28.580]  Yep.
[02:01:29.898 --> 02:01:30.438]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:30.458 --> 02:01:35.662]  I mean, Kubrick has this theme of the pedo cults and all this stuff through most of his films, right?
[02:01:35.682 --> 02:01:42.487]  Go back to Lolita, go back to The Shining where, you know, Danny has been essentially molested by the Jack Nicholson character, right?
[02:01:42.507 --> 02:01:44.509]  I mean, this is a theme throughout Kubrick.
[02:01:44.549 --> 02:01:48.632]  I think he was always trying to tell us that this is how the elite entrap people.
[02:01:48.672 --> 02:01:49.653]  This is how they get blackmailed.
[02:01:49.673 --> 02:01:50.333]  This is what they do.
[02:01:50.513 --> 02:01:51.874]  This is how the whole system works.
[02:01:51.954 --> 02:01:53.916]  It's a giant blackmail scam operation.
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.021]  And many books have come out actually vindicating that.
[02:01:57.041 --> 02:01:58.962]  Former Maddams, right, used to have the D.C.
[02:01:58.982 --> 02:01:59.623]  Maddam on, right?
[02:01:59.643 --> 02:02:00.863]  So you knew about this a long time ago.
[02:02:01.684 --> 02:02:03.185]  Now it's all just out in the open.
[02:02:03.565 --> 02:02:04.505]  It's clear for everybody.
[02:02:04.565 --> 02:02:05.706]  Externalization of the hierarchy.
[02:02:05.746 --> 02:02:07.267]  Everybody can look and see what's going on.
[02:02:08.688 --> 02:02:10.308]  So what are you expecting to do next?
[02:02:10.488 --> 02:02:12.590]  And how do you think it's going for them?
[02:02:13.650 --> 02:02:16.492]  Well, it's going to depend on what happens election-wise.
[02:02:16.512 --> 02:02:18.653]  I think we're going to have to wait and see whether they can
[02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:22.121]  Destroy the election happening, right?
[02:02:22.161 --> 02:02:23.361]  Destroy the possibility of that.
[02:02:23.402 --> 02:02:26.504]  That's what all this stuff is in the immediate intended to do, right?
[02:02:26.524 --> 02:02:34.629]  Is to get people to not vote, to get people to not look at what Trump's doing, to have this coup, to do whatever they can that's necessary, right?
[02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:35.750]  It could get really crazy.
[02:02:35.790 --> 02:02:37.371]  I expect it to in the next few months.
[02:02:38.352 --> 02:02:44.136]  But I would say that even after that, the election time, they're going to continue with the same thing.
[02:02:44.157 --> 02:02:45.037]  Oh, nothing lets up.
[02:02:45.498 --> 02:02:46.118]  Let's talk about that.
[02:02:46.579 --> 02:02:51.002]  If Trump loses, obviously Biden is a placeholder.
[02:02:51.042 --> 02:02:52.123]  Who are they planning to insert?
[02:02:53.324 --> 02:02:57.208]  I think you were right that it's going to be a Hillary Obama thing somehow, right?
[02:02:57.268 --> 02:02:58.429]  That's got to be in the cards.
[02:02:58.709 --> 02:03:00.270]  Who else could they have?
[02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:02.132]  There's no other candidates or people that
[02:03:02.702 --> 02:03:04.784]  Could even marshal enough support.
[02:03:04.824 --> 02:03:06.946]  I mean, I think Trump is still really popular.
[02:03:07.346 --> 02:03:09.988]  So they have to find these kind of placeholders, like you said.
[02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:15.873]  So I think that if that happens, it'll further agitate the opposition.
[02:03:15.913 --> 02:03:16.274]  Exactly.
[02:03:16.294 --> 02:03:18.035]  No one wants to actually go up against Trump.
[02:03:18.335 --> 02:03:19.857]  The secret is a real personality.
[02:03:19.897 --> 02:03:20.657]  He'll flamethrow him.
[02:03:20.978 --> 02:03:24.461]  But if you put a zombie up, Trump doesn't know how to deal with a zombie.
[02:03:24.481 --> 02:03:25.241]  He even says it.
[02:03:26.002 --> 02:03:30.366]  So it's very sophisticated alchemical rituals they're doing.
[02:03:32.052 --> 02:03:32.612]  Absolutely.
[02:03:32.673 --> 02:03:34.634]  Again, the alchemy is always mentioned.
[02:03:35.234 --> 02:03:41.798]  Again, whether it's Arthur Kessler, whether it's Fritjof Capra, whether any of these global elite, they will actually talk about alchemy in their books.
[02:03:41.818 --> 02:03:44.020]  Yeah, Trump will rise against a real challenger.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.781]  But if you're a gladiator, you enter the arena, there's a corpse.
[02:03:47.862 --> 02:03:49.983]  He's like, the public's like, where's the fight?
[02:03:50.083 --> 02:03:51.264]  Because he's fighting a corpse.
[02:03:51.784 --> 02:03:53.605]  People think Biden's weakness is strength.
[02:03:53.625 --> 02:03:54.266]  No, folks.
[02:03:55.767 --> 02:03:56.587]  It's beyond strength.
[02:03:56.647 --> 02:03:57.408]  It's victory for them.
[02:03:58.462 --> 02:04:06.106]  He's like a Muppet character with a robot Muppet character who has a virus or something and he fumbles the words.
[02:04:06.126 --> 02:04:06.686]  I don't know.
[02:04:06.786 --> 02:04:09.147]  Oh, I've gone and watched random live feeds.
[02:04:09.187 --> 02:04:10.848]  He can't string one sentence together.
[02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:13.269]  Did you see his YouTube ad?
[02:04:13.349 --> 02:04:15.090]  I mean, he fumbles in the YouTube ad.
[02:04:15.130 --> 02:04:16.191]  I saw it this morning.
[02:04:16.231 --> 02:04:18.672]  He's like, I really need your help today.
[02:04:19.052 --> 02:04:20.273]  He said Trump bad.
[02:04:25.399 --> 02:04:27.320]  I saw the black kids, they were cockroaches.
[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:28.180]  I mean, it's like, what?
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:38.342]  Yeah, I mean, this is the irony, is that this class, this political class, they are intensely racially minded, right?
[02:04:38.362 --> 02:04:45.724]  They continue this whole racial attitude, and so they want to actually damage the population as a whole, especially the black population.
[02:04:45.744 --> 02:04:48.805]  So that's it, because they're the elitist, so they have to like...
[02:04:49.225 --> 02:04:50.426]  Have a group they enslave.
[02:04:50.727 --> 02:04:52.448]  That's why they love homeless and all that.
[02:04:52.488 --> 02:05:03.419]  It's like, to them, to see a bunch of people in bed, to see us with swimming pools and jet airplanes and the elitist hate going to a club and seeing commoners with hot wives, hot husbands.
[02:05:03.759 --> 02:05:06.622]  They just genuinely are pissed by success.
[02:05:08.632 --> 02:05:13.298]  Yeah, I mean, who could have guessed that what they would bring is the religion of We Was Kings, right?
[02:05:13.318 --> 02:05:17.523]  I don't know if you know about this, but the whole black, Hebrew, Israelite, all this cult.
[02:05:17.623 --> 02:05:18.224]  It's a cult!
[02:05:18.304 --> 02:05:19.245]  It's a crazy cult!
[02:05:19.989 --> 02:05:30.857]  Just like the CIA and other groups have studied for years through ethnography, cults, indigenous religions, how do we tailor these fake religions to roll out new cults?
[02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:40.243]  Well, get into what you just mentioned, because there's all sorts of weird sabbatons and weird cults of the Vatican and weird, there's cults everywhere.
[02:05:40.303 --> 02:05:40.904]  What were you getting at?
[02:05:42.541 --> 02:05:49.864]  Just that these are perfect mechanisms for social engineering and for bringing in new plans or new, I mean, experimenting.
[02:05:49.884 --> 02:05:54.286]  There's a lot of different uses for cults, but I mean, why do you think Hollywood is so full of cults, right?
[02:05:54.326 --> 02:05:56.167]  Kabbalistic cults, New Age cults.
[02:05:56.187 --> 02:05:58.428]  I mean, Hollywood is just one big cult, basically, right?
[02:05:58.948 --> 02:06:04.431]  I mean, so there are test labs, and the CIA has studied this for years, right?
[02:06:04.451 --> 02:06:05.471]  It's called ethnography.
[02:06:05.831 --> 02:06:09.373]  They would actually bring in anthropologists undercover,
[02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:14.233]  Did you know, by the way, Indiana Jones, I was watching your funny clip about you as Indiana Jones.
[02:06:15.033 --> 02:06:18.316]  In the script, Indiana Jones is said to be part of the OSS.
[02:06:18.356 --> 02:06:20.218]  He's actually an OSS operative.
[02:06:20.258 --> 02:06:22.339]  He's an undercover anthropologist.
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:24.942]  And so the CIA actually did that, right?
[02:06:25.082 --> 02:06:34.310]  They would take these anthropologists and they would go and they would study cultures in order to figure out every little node, every weak point, every tension point, and exacerbate that.
[02:06:34.690 --> 02:06:36.111]  That's exactly what they're doing in the U.S.
[02:06:36.191 --> 02:06:37.793]  Oh, that's exactly what the race war is.
[02:06:38.721 --> 02:06:39.423]  They admit that.
[02:06:39.484 --> 02:06:44.798]  I mean, that's in the WikiLeaks that Hillary's talking to the head of a university, psychological, and she goes, what do we do?
[02:06:44.818 --> 02:06:46.061]  And he goes, war, culture, war.
[02:06:46.522 --> 02:06:47.284]  And that's all this is.
[02:06:48.695 --> 02:06:50.336]  Yeah, welcome to the Manson dimension.
[02:06:50.396 --> 02:06:50.817]  Exactly.
[02:06:51.517 --> 02:06:52.338]  No, I agree with you.
[02:06:52.358 --> 02:06:53.739]  That's very profound what you said.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:55.901]  Because Manson worked for the CIA.
[02:06:56.322 --> 02:06:59.264]  It's come out he was putting out drugs for a mind control operation.
[02:06:59.284 --> 02:07:00.025]  That's been confirmed.
[02:07:00.625 --> 02:07:02.487]  He wasn't in the CIA, but he worked for them.
[02:07:02.927 --> 02:07:09.293]  And they burned him, but he was a beta test of a race war they were looking at then, and now they're looking at it now.
[02:07:10.632 --> 02:07:13.233]  Yeah, so they'll run these models and these tests.
[02:07:13.393 --> 02:07:27.880]  And so what we're looking at now, it's almost like a combination of color revolution, NED, open society funded stuff, mixed with the Manson experiment, test tube thing, mixed with black, you know, we was Kang's black live matter, Hebrew Israelites.
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:35.323]  So they're rolling out all this stuff at once because all of those things, in my view, even Jonestown, I think you could look at Jonestown as another example of this.
[02:07:35.783 --> 02:07:37.884]  Jonestown is a similar pattern.
[02:07:38.024 --> 02:07:39.305]  Oh, that was CIA and Medley.
[02:07:39.793 --> 02:07:40.793]  Yep, exactly.
[02:07:41.294 --> 02:07:48.957]  It's declassified that was a test, so instead of just turning humanity loose and going, because people just want victory.
[02:07:49.157 --> 02:07:51.918]  They want competitiveness, they want men and women, they want families.
[02:07:51.938 --> 02:07:53.899]  I mean the truth is we just want normalcy.
[02:07:54.179 --> 02:07:57.721]  They're injecting a virus constantly trying to sabotage that.
[02:07:58.021 --> 02:08:01.262]  The truth is we just come together without them.
[02:08:01.642 --> 02:08:02.943]  They're there to create the division.
[02:08:04.597 --> 02:08:05.037]  Absolutely.
[02:08:05.398 --> 02:08:08.300]  You exacerbate any tension areas, right?
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:11.702]  Blow it up into something that's not even really a problem, right?
[02:08:12.142 --> 02:08:13.203]  You look at the statistics.
[02:08:13.663 --> 02:08:16.365]  But that's the model of how you do the balkanization, right?
[02:08:16.385 --> 02:08:31.316]  I mean, the arc of crisis model, for example, Brzezinski, what he did was in the former Soviet bloc, he just exacerbated any possible tensions in the former Soviet bloc, and that helped defeat, you know, the remaining Soviet satellites in the Cold War.
[02:08:31.836 --> 02:08:36.319]  That technology of micro-nations, balkanization, I think is what they're rolling out.
[02:08:36.339 --> 02:08:40.461]  So I think that in the long term, they'd actually like to balkanize the U.S.
[02:08:40.521 --> 02:08:42.602]  and split it up into who knows what.
[02:08:45.524 --> 02:08:45.984]  Exactly.
[02:08:46.024 --> 02:08:48.205]  They admit world government isn't about unification.
[02:08:48.245 --> 02:08:49.766]  It's about balkanization.
[02:08:50.026 --> 02:08:51.527]  Well, Jay, I've seen your work before.
[02:08:51.547 --> 02:08:53.288]  I'm really impressed with you coming on with us today.
[02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:55.089]  Please join us again very, very soon.
[02:08:55.209 --> 02:08:57.251]  JaysAnalysis.com.
[02:08:57.291 --> 02:08:59.932]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:08:59.952 --> 02:09:00.552]  You've got 30 seconds.
[02:09:00.572 --> 02:09:01.233]  What else do you want to say?
[02:09:03.155 --> 02:09:08.478]  Yeah, I would just say if people want to research my work, you can go to my website and you can get signed copies of the books there.
[02:09:08.498 --> 02:09:17.862]  I have basically an entire archive of lecture courses, so I offer what I call a graduate course in geopolitics and the elite writings for
[02:09:19.122 --> 02:09:19.422]  $60 a year.
[02:09:19.823 --> 02:09:21.923]  I mean basically you're paying five bucks right?
[02:09:21.963 --> 02:09:22.744]  No, it's wonderful.
[02:09:22.764 --> 02:09:25.585]  People should pay to build an infrastructure.
[02:09:25.625 --> 02:09:27.966]  People should or they'll pay dearly for not supporting.
[02:09:28.286 --> 02:09:29.987]  All right, Jay Dyer, thank you so much.
[02:09:30.007 --> 02:09:30.267]  Thank you.
[02:09:30.287 --> 02:09:31.167]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:09:31.387 --> 02:09:32.808]  Paul Joseph Watson's coming up.
[02:09:32.868 --> 02:09:34.449]  I've got some key announcements straight ahead.
[02:09:34.929 --> 02:09:38.610]  Stay with us on this June 23rd Tuesday transmission.
[02:09:41.251 --> 02:09:44.293]  All right folks, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:09:44.373 --> 02:09:44.753]  Paul,
[02:09:46.038 --> 02:09:48.300]  Joseph Watson's about to take over from the UK.
[02:09:49.721 --> 02:09:51.622]  But I wanted to talk about Roger Stone.
[02:09:52.123 --> 02:09:56.966]  Coming up in like seven, eight days, next Tuesday, he reports to federal prison.
[02:09:56.986 --> 02:10:00.949]  So let's put up on screen for folks the fact that this is a death sentence.
[02:10:00.989 --> 02:10:08.115]  If you believe the government story that COVID's killing everyone, they've released all these criminals from massive crimes, but not Roger Stone.
[02:10:09.087 --> 02:10:13.190]  In fact, I was shocked to learn that Attorney General Bill Barr's directive to the U.S.
[02:10:13.230 --> 02:10:34.167]  Bureau of Prisons that inmates that were convicted of nonviolent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super lawyer criminal Michael Avenatti, who stole $25 million from his clients, from former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who pled guilty to fraud,
[02:10:34.887 --> 02:10:35.828]  I have been
[02:10:56.505 --> 02:11:11.535]  Absolutely shocked by the fact that Roger Stone has ordered a report to a coronavirus-infested prison in rural Georgia on June 30th at 67 years old, which is a death sentence with asthma, and if you believe in the whole COVID thing.
[02:11:12.095 --> 02:11:20.841]  Tomorrow, Roger will file an emergency exclusive motion before a judge, Amy Berman Jackson, requesting an extension
[02:11:21.721 --> 02:11:31.903]  In his surrender, time-based on current condition and the very real prospect of contracting COVID-19 in the facility, I am designed and designated to go to.
[02:11:31.923 --> 02:11:39.825]  In the event that Judge Jackson denies the request by Stone, he will have exhausted all his legal remedies.
[02:11:40.606 --> 02:11:46.287]  It is at that time that the President really should commute Roger Stone's sentence on humanitarian grounds.
[02:11:47.432 --> 02:11:50.773]  And that's what I got from sources very close to Roger, not from Roger.
[02:11:51.593 --> 02:11:57.814]  So there we are, eight days, countdown to death sentence for Roger Stone.
[02:11:59.815 --> 02:12:00.755]  But you hear what I said?
[02:12:02.395 --> 02:12:13.078]  Harvey Weinstein, Trump's former lawyer, Cohen, Avenatti, all these incredibly bad guys,
[02:12:14.397 --> 02:12:18.939]  They get released from prison for convictions for rape, embezzlement, fraud.
[02:12:18.979 --> 02:12:19.880]  It's all A-OK.
[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:22.961]  But Roger Stone, they say, lied to Congress.
[02:12:25.482 --> 02:12:34.987]  Lied to Congress about talking to WikiLeaks when he didn't even say he talked to WikiLeaks.
[02:12:35.007 --> 02:12:37.188]  He said he talked to someone that knew WikiLeaks.
[02:12:37.308 --> 02:12:37.988]  It's insane.
[02:12:39.517 --> 02:12:44.400]  But it's the climate we're in right now, ladies and gentlemen, it's where this country has gone.
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:47.182]  But it's okay because AOC says she's black.
[02:12:49.563 --> 02:12:52.565]  Major announcement, AOC declares Latinos are black.
[02:12:53.946 --> 02:12:56.467]  And she's released a new photo of herself, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:57.268 --> 02:12:59.549]  So you can't question her or your anti-black.
[02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:05.753]  Meanwhile, the Democratic Party spends all its time trying to abort and kill as many blacks as they can.
[02:13:06.753 --> 02:13:08.955]  Keep your friends close, your enemies closer.
[02:13:10.265 --> 02:13:13.107]  You know, I'm not going to give black folks any platitudes or kiss your ass.
[02:13:14.628 --> 02:13:16.809]  But I'm out of virtue of signaling Trendy trying to kill you.
[02:13:18.610 --> 02:13:20.091]  And these people make me sick.
[02:13:20.111 --> 02:13:26.414]  It'd be like if I got up here on air with an Afro on my head and I said, I'm black now.
[02:13:26.514 --> 02:13:26.995]  Listen to me.
[02:13:27.055 --> 02:13:27.535]  I'm Trendy.
[02:13:27.555 --> 02:13:28.295]  You'd laugh at me.
[02:13:28.936 --> 02:13:31.057]  But when these leftists do it, it's so cute.
[02:13:32.078 --> 02:13:32.798]  It's so funny.
[02:13:33.278 --> 02:13:35.920]  All their PR firms trying to trick as many people as they can.
[02:13:37.022 --> 02:13:38.728]  But the good news is, Hollywood's collapsing.
[02:13:38.748 --> 02:13:40.374]  Their whole pedophile rings are collapsing.
[02:13:40.835 --> 02:13:43.043]  Their whole system is collapsing and they don't know what to do.
[02:13:43.945 --> 02:13:47.088]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson's loaded for bear, as he always is.
[02:13:47.668 --> 02:13:49.850]  He takes over the other side of this 60-second break.
[02:13:50.611 --> 02:14:03.242]  And I hope, whether you're listening on the radio, or watching on TV, or watching on InfoWars.com, Ford's My Show, or Bandai Video, that you share the link, because it's that action that's kept us on air, but not just kept us on air.
[02:14:03.583 --> 02:14:06.685]  Thanks to you, we are kicking Globalist's butt.
[02:14:07.466 --> 02:14:09.388]  We are challenging their fraudulent narratives.
[02:14:09.408 --> 02:14:14.512]  We're posting the videos of all these medical doctors and scientists pointing out the COVID-19s of fraud.
[02:14:14.572 --> 02:14:16.914]  We are exposing their mask fraud.
[02:14:16.954 --> 02:14:17.954]  We're doing it all.
[02:14:18.595 --> 02:14:22.458]  And you, the listeners, have kept us in attack formation.
[02:14:23.219 --> 02:14:24.700]  So stay in attack formation.
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:27.442]  We'll be back with PJW.
[02:14:28.823 --> 02:14:30.324]  And we are live.
[02:14:30.865 --> 02:14:32.266]  Gonna start off by talking about
[02:14:33.067 --> 02:14:46.332]  Something other than violent communist revolutionaries taking over society with the aid of every major cultural institution, Hollywood, every legacy media outlet, Silicon Valley, and basically every major corporation.
[02:14:46.352 --> 02:14:54.035]  We're not going to start with that for a change, we are going to get into that later, but we're actually going to start with some good news.
[02:14:54.135 --> 02:15:00.918]  Yes, some actual good news on the subject of social media censorship, because we've had the revelations today of course
[02:15:01.872 --> 02:15:18.599]  Out of Project Veritas, regarding more Facebook bias, regarding more flagrant lies in terms of Zuckerberg getting up in front of Ted Cruz and saying that there's no political bias at Facebook, evidence in Triplicate once again that yes, there is, but we have some good news.
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:25.062]  On the social media front, you know, people always say, well, why not just build your own social media network?
[02:15:25.142 --> 02:15:28.964]  Like when people get deplatformed by banks, why not just build your own bank?
[02:15:29.904 --> 02:15:31.145]  Well, someone actually did that.
[02:15:32.290 --> 02:15:46.220]  And the media, the legacy media at least, is starting to get a little anxious, a little nervous about the growth of this one particular network, which is called Parler or Parlay if you're using the French term.
[02:15:47.081 --> 02:15:52.765]  Headline media demonization of Parler begins after free speech network attracts flood of new users.
[02:15:53.586 --> 02:15:55.127]  And I noticed about a week ago
[02:15:56.252 --> 02:16:05.199]  That the engagement I was getting on Parler on some posts was actually greater than the posts I was, you know, simulating on Twitter, the same posts.
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:16.387]  They had a flood of users last year after the Saudi Arabian government started censoring its citizens on Twitter, with Twitter's complicity of course, who then all flooded over to Parler.
[02:16:16.988 --> 02:16:22.792]  And at that point, mid-2019, Apple and the other app stores, Google Play,
[02:16:23.743 --> 02:16:29.748]  Suddenly started to have a problem with Parler and suddenly started to claim that they were hosting offensive content.
[02:16:30.148 --> 02:16:34.052]  Now, of course, Twitter and Facebook can host offensive content all day long.
[02:16:34.672 --> 02:16:42.419]  Facebook can literally have mass shooters live-streaming their massacres on Facebook, like in the case of the New Zealand mosque shooter.
[02:16:43.317 --> 02:16:47.339]  Like in the case of the guy who shot the two news reporters live on air.
[02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:50.181]  Both of those massacres live-streamed on Facebook.
[02:16:50.201 --> 02:16:51.041]  That's not a problem.
[02:16:51.602 --> 02:16:57.545]  That's not going to get Facebook taken off the Google Play Store app or the Apple Store app, no.
[02:16:58.466 --> 02:17:06.350]  But because Parler had a few edgy posts, a few offensive posts, which they forgot to delete or didn't have the moderators at the time to delete,
[02:17:07.322 --> 02:17:14.808]  Apple began threatening to kick them off the App Store, treating them as a publisher and not a platform.
[02:17:14.848 --> 02:17:21.794]  Of course, Twitter and Facebook get treated as platforms, so they're not responsible for anything posted on their website.
[02:17:22.614 --> 02:17:32.903]  But as soon as you get an alternate alt-tech platform that actually supports free speech, then they suddenly become a publisher and they're responsible for everything posted on their website.
[02:17:33.543 --> 02:17:35.665]  But now in an entirely expected development,
[02:17:36.821 --> 02:17:40.465]  In fact, I considered tweeting, Oh, Paula's getting really popular.
[02:17:40.785 --> 02:17:44.169]  Watch out for media demonization hit pieces within a week.
[02:17:44.229 --> 02:17:46.651]  And it actually happened within 24 hours.
[02:17:47.472 --> 02:17:53.779]  Media hit pieces against pro-free speech social network Paula began after the site attracted a ton of new followers.
[02:17:54.938 --> 02:18:20.372]  Now there's a lot of people on Twitter on the left, which of course is a leftist echo chamber, and that's fine for that to be a leftist echo chamber, but when an organisation that springs out of the MAGA movement, the Conservative movement, does the same thing, oh it's terrible that it's a right-wing echo chamber, even though Twitter has now literally become a platform for far-left extremists to mob, dox and harass Conservatives en masse.
[02:18:20.392 --> 02:18:21.793]  We're going to get into that later as well.
[02:18:22.765 --> 02:18:29.548]  But if people on Parler just want to have a conversation with each other and generally agree with each other, that's terrible, that's horrific.
[02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:32.049]  And they don't really know how to handle it.
[02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:35.351]  There are some people on Twitter on the left who say just let them get on with it.
[02:18:36.352 --> 02:18:39.113]  Let them have this Twegxit, as they're calling it.
[02:18:39.493 --> 02:18:42.154]  Let them all go over to Parler and have their little echo chamber.
[02:18:42.595 --> 02:18:47.137]  Others are calling for it to be banned, and it almost was banned last year on Apple Store.
[02:18:47.197 --> 02:18:49.518]  So we'll see if that happens again.
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:19:13.973]  But the article continues, the website's engagement levels have skyrocketed in recent weeks, as many more people choose to transition away from Twitter, which has become a cesspit of censorship and a platform for far-left-wing extremists to engage in the mob harassment and doxing of conservatives, which they allow, by the way, on a daily basis and do nothing whatsoever to stop it, despite it being a direct violation of their own terms of service.
[02:19:14.854 --> 02:19:17.075]  Numerous members of Congress in the United States
[02:19:18.101 --> 02:19:27.104]  And Conservative MPs in the UK have also started signing up to the network, prompting anxiety among Silicon Valley that Parler could eventually become a genuine competitor.
[02:19:27.924 --> 02:19:35.207]  Now, the one thing that needs to happen, which I make the point at the end of this article, Donald Trump himself needs to sign up for Parler.
[02:19:35.267 --> 02:19:36.227]  He's not on there.
[02:19:36.247 --> 02:19:38.368]  I think Don Junior's on there.
[02:19:38.448 --> 02:19:39.528]  Eric Trump's on there.
[02:19:39.988 --> 02:19:47.551]  Trump needs to sign up to Parler and he needs to post Parleys, as they call them, posts exclusively to Parler.
[02:19:48.602 --> 02:19:49.803]  Ones which are not on Twitter.
[02:19:50.143 --> 02:20:00.152]  Because of course that will then force the mainstream media and all the leftists who hyperventilate on a daily basis about every single word that Trump tweets over to parlour.
[02:20:00.212 --> 02:20:01.333]  And that's a good thing.
[02:20:01.913 --> 02:20:04.215]  Then they won't be able to claim it's an echo chamber.
[02:20:04.635 --> 02:20:06.977]  Then it will be forced into the mainstream.
[02:20:07.117 --> 02:20:08.699]  Trump needs to do that.
[02:20:08.719 --> 02:20:09.860]  He should have done it last year.
[02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:10.880]  Hasn't happened yet.
[02:20:11.201 --> 02:20:12.522]  He needs to do it now.
[02:20:13.684 --> 02:20:25.812]  Unlike Twitter and Facebook, which have become notorious for banning users and removing content at the behest of organized left-wing mobs, Parler's terms of service are in line with the FCC's definition of obscene content.
[02:20:25.832 --> 02:20:26.752]  Well, how dare they?
[02:20:27.193 --> 02:20:32.736]  Which allows for offensive posts so long as they're of literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
[02:20:33.677 --> 02:20:35.318]  This has panicked the mainstream media,
[02:20:36.246 --> 02:20:45.951]  Who, of course, have worked in concert with Big Tech over the last few years to de-platform prominent voices who dare to dissent against the current takeover of society by woke radicals.
[02:20:46.011 --> 02:20:48.432]  And boy, has that escalated over the past month.
[02:20:49.432 --> 02:20:59.077]  A hit piece in the UK Independent tries to connect Paula to Gab, using guilt by association by suggesting Gab was responsible for mass shootings.
[02:20:59.557 --> 02:21:02.939]  So again, because one individual back in, I think it was November 2018,
[02:21:04.696 --> 02:21:08.318]  posted on Gab before he carried out this mass shooting.
[02:21:08.778 --> 02:21:14.600]  From that moment onwards, Gab became the platform of racist right-wing mass shooters.
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:17.121]  Of course, they had their app pulled.
[02:21:17.161 --> 02:21:20.283]  Now they have Visa withdrawing its services.
[02:21:20.983 --> 02:21:27.606]  Oh, but you can go on Facebook as the New Zealand Mosque Shooter and live stream it on that platform.
[02:21:27.926 --> 02:21:29.206]  What's going to happen to Facebook?
[02:21:29.486 --> 02:21:30.927]  Absolutely nothing.
[02:21:31.641 --> 02:21:39.271]  So in this article they try to link Parler to Gab despite the fact there's no connection whatsoever in terms of the founders, the people who run it.
[02:21:40.192 --> 02:21:42.695]  The story also quotes another sources claiming Parler
[02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:46.082]  It's full of fury, fear and conspiracy theories.
[02:21:46.402 --> 02:21:49.624]  Because there's no fury whatsoever on Twitter, is there?
[02:21:50.065 --> 02:21:53.747]  There's not literal death threats and plots against Trump on a daily basis.
[02:21:54.167 --> 02:22:09.237]  There's not people being labelled Karen, hunted down and exposed, and people contacting their employers, people contacting their family members, people ruining their lives over claims that didn't have no proof of even existing, which we're going to get onto in a moment.
[02:22:09.577 --> 02:22:11.859]  No, there's no fury whatsoever on Twitter.
[02:22:12.569 --> 02:22:15.611]  It's a peaceful place for reasoned conversation.
[02:22:16.372 --> 02:22:29.021]  While also suggesting the site is a hotbed of KKK discussion, because they found two posts referring to the late Senator Robert Byrd, who of course was a Democrat and a close friend of Hillary Clinton, but that doesn't matter.
[02:22:29.381 --> 02:22:31.923]  Another hit piece in Yahoo News expressed concern that
[02:22:32.977 --> 02:22:37.960]  Devin Nunes, Republican of California, touted the network to his 1.1 million Twitter followers.
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:38.880]  Again, how dare he?
[02:22:39.220 --> 02:22:46.244]  While also charging that the network is a conservative echo chamber, apparently it's fine for Twitter to be a far-left echo chamber.
[02:22:46.964 --> 02:22:52.907]  The story also complains many threads on Paul and mock Black Lives Matter protesters, and we can't have that, can we?
[02:22:53.947 --> 02:22:57.189]  Of course, people being banned for that on Facebook and Twitter on a daily basis.
[02:22:57.809 --> 02:23:01.171]  Another Twitter user in the UK is already trying to get Paul abandoned,
[02:23:02.071 --> 02:23:07.453]  He's put up a petition on the UK Parliament website for the UK Government to ban Parler.
[02:23:07.873 --> 02:23:09.914]  So far, it's got five signatures.
[02:23:09.994 --> 02:23:10.694]  Good luck with that.
[02:23:11.234 --> 02:23:13.355]  Big Tech is clearly frightened of Parler's sudden growth.
[02:23:13.375 --> 02:23:21.158]  There are also signs that leftists are creating accounts to combat Conservative talking points, which is a good thing as it will massively grow the user base.
[02:23:22.218 --> 02:23:25.139]  So, as I said before, all we need to do is to have President Trump
[02:23:25.985 --> 02:23:29.986]  Start a parlor account and begin posting exclusive messages there that don't appear on Twitter.
[02:23:30.026 --> 02:23:31.867]  That will force everybody over.
[02:23:32.447 --> 02:23:42.030]  This so-called executive order that was supposed to address big tech censorship was absolutely completely ceremonial, did basically nothing.
[02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:50.272]  Now we have reports coming out over the past few days that President Trump met secretly with Mark Zuckerberg and they struck some kind of deal
[02:23:51.405 --> 02:23:56.784]  Where Trump wouldn't openly criticise Zuckerberg on Twitter, he would only go after Twitter itself.
[02:23:58.082 --> 02:24:08.868]  Therefore, allowing Trump to maintain his presence on Facebook, where Zuckerberg simply criticizes him, doesn't remove or censor any of Trump's posts as Twitter has done.
[02:24:09.308 --> 02:24:10.488]  Trump needs to get on Parler.
[02:24:10.508 --> 02:24:13.550]  I'm going to get more into this on the other side of the break, but it's great news.
[02:24:14.090 --> 02:24:15.571]  Summit.news, don't go away.
[02:24:15.771 --> 02:24:21.454]  So Parler.com is emerging as potentially a long-term competitor to Twitter.
[02:24:21.474 --> 02:24:25.616]  Obviously, its user base is far less than Twitter at this moment.
[02:24:26.351 --> 02:24:37.021]  But the kind of engagement I've seen on Parler over the past week is absolutely monumental and nothing like I've seen on any other alt-tech platform ever in existence.
[02:24:37.101 --> 02:24:44.248]  And now Parler is calling for Twitter exit, Twexit, Exodus in declaration of independence reports, Breitbart.
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:59.751]  The free speech social media platform Poller is calling for Twexit, a mass exodus of Twitter users, and its recently issued tech declaration of independence and Bill of Rights, in which it takes a stand against acts of censorship and data abuse by Silicon Valley giants like Twitter and Facebook.
[02:25:00.631 --> 02:25:01.512]  I don't think people should
[02:25:02.597 --> 02:25:05.318]  Just abandon the battlefield in terms of Twitter.
[02:25:05.358 --> 02:25:08.619]  I think they should remain on Twitter and ride it until the wheels fall off.
[02:25:08.919 --> 02:25:13.420]  You're probably going to get banned anyway at some point, so you might as well stay on there until that point.
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:15.661]  But definitely everyone needs to sign up.
[02:25:16.081 --> 02:25:17.381]  I'm not getting paid to say this.
[02:25:17.421 --> 02:25:18.701]  I'm not sponsored by Paula.
[02:25:19.042 --> 02:25:24.183]  Everyone needs to sign up there though, because it really is making them nervous, which is why you're seeing all these hit pieces.
[02:25:24.463 --> 02:25:27.064]  Because God forbid we have competition.
[02:25:27.424 --> 02:25:31.125]  God forbid we allow dissidents to express themselves on the internet, right?
[02:25:32.395 --> 02:25:36.556]  It's actually happening in greater and greater numbers on parlor.com.
[02:25:36.576 --> 02:25:41.118]  And it's happening because of stories like this, out of information liberation.
[02:25:41.938 --> 02:25:44.639]  Reddit starts banning users for their upvotes.
[02:25:45.319 --> 02:25:48.700]  Yeah, it's not even for the posts anymore, it's for the upvotes.
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:50.721]  It's like you like someone's tweet on Twitter.
[02:25:51.081 --> 02:25:56.582]  In fact, people are now being fired for following Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec on Twitter.
[02:25:56.923 --> 02:25:59.563]  It's not even the tweets anymore, it's who you follow.
[02:26:00.504 --> 02:26:01.324]  It's who you like.
[02:26:02.176 --> 02:26:05.397]  Retweets aren't endorsements, doesn't matter anymore, they are, you're fired.
[02:26:05.818 --> 02:26:12.260]  Now Condé Nast's Reddit on Sunday started issuing temp bans against users for upvoting WrongThink.
[02:26:13.201 --> 02:26:19.543]  This screenshot was shared by a user on WatchRedditDie, a subreddit which chronicles Reddit's aggressive censorship.
[02:26:19.563 --> 02:26:23.805]  It says, your account has been suspended from Reddit for breaking the rules.
[02:26:24.105 --> 02:26:27.367]  You upvoted a post or comment that was determined to be against our policies.
[02:26:28.347 --> 02:26:29.808]  They're now merely expressing
[02:26:30.660 --> 02:26:37.063]  Support or highlighting a post in terms of an upvote, not even saying anything, is enough to get you banned.
[02:26:38.303 --> 02:26:48.227]  Reddit announced in February that users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantine communities will receive automated warnings followed by further consequences like temporary or permanent suspension.
[02:26:48.668 --> 02:26:50.869]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[02:26:51.889 --> 02:26:58.912]  There was another post which was removed after getting 52,000 upvotes which said the fact that two weeks ago
[02:26:59.850 --> 02:27:05.573]  You were considered a selfish a-hole if you went out to socialise, and now it's okay for thousands of people to gather.
[02:27:05.933 --> 02:27:08.055]  Shows you how much media controls the masses.
[02:27:08.435 --> 02:27:11.236]  Completely legitimate, rational point.
[02:27:11.817 --> 02:27:14.138]  No hatred against minorities.
[02:27:14.538 --> 02:27:15.379]  Nothing whatsoever.
[02:27:15.399 --> 02:27:17.680]  52,000 upvotes removed.
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:19.641]  Of course, the Donald subreddit
[02:27:20.638 --> 02:27:29.286]  was credited during the 2016 election as being one of the most influential places where memes were created and spread.
[02:27:29.326 --> 02:27:36.112]  They actually did university studies into the most successful platforms for spreading conservative right-wing memes.
[02:27:36.713 --> 02:27:41.357]  The two at the top of the list were Paul 4chan and the Donald subreddit.
[02:27:41.397 --> 02:27:43.259]  Of course what happened to the Donald subreddit?
[02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:49.312]  It got quarantined for posts, which the moderators censored and deleted.
[02:27:49.372 --> 02:27:49.872]  Didn't matter.
[02:27:49.912 --> 02:27:58.055]  It got quarantined, so it got put into a, you know, a bans that got put on the naughty step, where you had to sign into an account to see anything.
[02:27:58.535 --> 02:27:59.335]  It got restricted.
[02:27:59.375 --> 02:28:00.955]  It got relegated in the algorithm.
[02:28:01.356 --> 02:28:03.036]  Now, I don't think it even exists anymore.
[02:28:03.076 --> 02:28:04.417]  Last time I checked, it wasn't there.
[02:28:04.457 --> 02:28:06.657]  I think they started their own website to replace it.
[02:28:07.217 --> 02:28:09.238]  But Reddit is the worst of the worst.
[02:28:10.278 --> 02:28:11.879]  They're also deleting videos
[02:28:12.711 --> 02:28:15.592]  Which show people being assaulted in grocery stores.
[02:28:15.632 --> 02:28:26.096]  Of course, you can post violent videos of Antifa and BLM radicals attacking white people all day long, and it gets celebrated on Twitter, and it gets 300,000 likes, that's fine.
[02:28:26.816 --> 02:28:33.598]  You post a video of a white person being assaulted, and let's face it, there are a lot of those videos recently on there, and it's gone.
[02:28:34.018 --> 02:28:35.019]  It's deleted.
[02:28:35.999 --> 02:28:41.381]  So now they're suspending banning people simply for upvoting things on Reddit,
[02:28:42.799 --> 02:28:47.986]  Meanwhile, we have this headline out of the Daily Caller.
[02:28:48.006 --> 02:28:54.996]  Sorry, we're going to go to that after because we've got a clip to play and we've only got four minutes left in this segment, so I'm going to hold that over so we can get to the full clip.
[02:28:56.218 --> 02:28:59.302]  Still on the subject of social media, this is what I talked about with Twitter.
[02:29:00.239 --> 02:29:12.911]  Twitter is not only a dumpster fire of censorship, it's now a platform for criminals to brag about their criminal and violent behaviour, as we've seen over the past four weeks, and to organise that violent criminal behaviour.
[02:29:13.492 --> 02:29:21.800]  And it's a platform to organise the mass mob, harassment and doxing of, quote, conservatives, or indeed anyone.
[02:29:22.828 --> 02:29:25.129]  Not even political in this case.
[02:29:25.769 --> 02:29:27.890]  Headline out of Gateway Pundit.
[02:29:28.410 --> 02:29:31.291]  Anti-white activist follows terrified white woman.
[02:29:31.912 --> 02:29:34.393]  Film sir, leftists celebrate harassment.
[02:29:34.433 --> 02:29:34.933]  This video
[02:29:36.044 --> 02:29:38.826]  Has got like five million views last time I checked.
[02:29:39.327 --> 02:29:45.872]  Again, a flagrant violation of Twitter's own terms of service, where you can't organize the harassment, the doxing of individuals.
[02:29:46.192 --> 02:29:47.814]  They do it on a daily basis.
[02:29:48.194 --> 02:29:51.016]  Somebody posts a confrontation with a Karen.
[02:29:51.537 --> 02:29:56.961]  Of course, this Karen meme has now become a conduit for people to just harass middle-aged white women.
[02:29:57.341 --> 02:30:05.488]  Started out in my mind as a kind of joke about people who are too controlling regarding coronavirus, regarding the wearing of masks.
[02:30:05.988 --> 02:30:08.069]  Regarding social distancing.
[02:30:08.909 --> 02:30:14.371]  And we still see a lot of that with people being caught on tape lecturing others about them not social distancing enough.
[02:30:14.871 --> 02:30:17.372]  But the Karen meme has definitely mutated.
[02:30:17.712 --> 02:30:21.653]  And now it's basically just another excuse to harass white people on the street.
[02:30:22.073 --> 02:30:30.576]  Not just harass them, but then post the video on Twitter, socially shame them, and organize a hate mob to harass and dox them.
[02:30:30.816 --> 02:30:33.557]  We've seen this with children on TikTok.
[02:30:34.306 --> 02:30:35.006]  Teenagers!
[02:30:35.086 --> 02:30:39.027]  Trump supporting teenagers who make slightly edgy TikTok videos.
[02:30:40.168 --> 02:30:56.793]  People record those videos, download them, post them on Twitter, then in the response thread it's literally hundreds of people bragging, oh I've got his home address, I've got his work address, I've got his mother's, the location of his mother's school where she works, let's call them up, let's go to the address.
[02:30:57.478 --> 02:31:00.584]  Completely criminal, completely against Twitter's terms of service.
[02:31:00.885 --> 02:31:04.471]  They have a lexicon called Twitter do your thing.
[02:31:04.972 --> 02:31:08.259]  Whenever they post one of these harassment videos, Twitter do your thing.
[02:31:09.099 --> 02:31:23.507]  Which is a dog whistle for hundreds if not thousands of people to organize in a kind of human intelligence gathering operation to find out where people live, where they work, where their family members live, dox, threaten, harass them, get them fired.
[02:31:23.808 --> 02:31:25.388]  This happens on a daily basis.
[02:31:25.889 --> 02:31:27.510]  Twitter does nothing whatsoever.
[02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:30.752]  It gets 250,000, 300,000 likes.
[02:31:30.812 --> 02:31:31.712]  The posts remain up.
[02:31:32.072 --> 02:31:33.453]  Now there's another example of that.
[02:31:34.314 --> 02:31:36.515]  A Seattle-based Black Lives Matter activist
[02:31:37.392 --> 02:31:50.580]  With the Twitter handle White People Hate, which stands for White People Hate, again very tolerant, followed a terrified white woman home, harassed her, filmed her address and license plate, and is attempting to ruin her life for some social media clout.
[02:31:51.400 --> 02:32:00.225]  Now in this video, you'll see this woman is absolutely terrified, she's screaming, not because she thinks the dangerous black man is going to violently attack her, that's not what's going on.
[02:32:00.645 --> 02:32:01.586]  She's terrified,
[02:32:02.392 --> 02:32:13.079]  And she says it numerous times, because he's filming her license plate, he's filming her house, saying this is where she lives, claiming she called him the N-word, but not in his original tweet.
[02:32:13.559 --> 02:32:18.802]  He only claimed she called him the N-word when one of the neighbors came out and said, why are you harassing this woman?
[02:32:19.423 --> 02:32:21.344]  And then people went through his Twitter history,
[02:32:22.176 --> 02:32:32.666]  And found numerous examples where he claims people called him the N-word with no video evidence, no tweets, no proof whatsoever, almost certainly made that claim up.
[02:32:32.966 --> 02:32:45.238]  But now this woman's life is probably going to be ruined because a hate mob of millions of people have seen this video, know where she lives, they know where she works by now because it's all in the thread, and now her life is ruined for what?
[02:32:46.115 --> 02:32:48.476]  That's Twitter, that's what Twitter's become.
[02:32:48.496 --> 02:32:49.677]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[02:32:49.957 --> 02:32:54.259]  Now we're going to get into the latest Facebook revelations about Project Veritas.
[02:32:54.559 --> 02:33:00.522]  Just the final book note on that harassment video of Karen, yet another Karen, there's one on a daily basis.
[02:33:00.562 --> 02:33:13.489]  Of course last week they harassed and bullied another Karen who is a police officer who was merely expressing concern about how she thought her food might be poisoned in light of this atmosphere of rampant
[02:33:14.053 --> 02:33:16.074]  Vitriolic hatred against cops.
[02:33:16.795 --> 02:33:22.038]  She did a video, sat in a police car, saying she was concerned about her food being poisoned.
[02:33:22.398 --> 02:33:23.699]  Her life was utterly ruined.
[02:33:23.739 --> 02:33:25.980]  She was publicly shamed by millions of people.
[02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:27.801]  Again, Twitter did nothing about that.
[02:33:28.461 --> 02:33:33.964]  An addendum, though, is this Carlos Dillard, who harassed this other woman because she flipped him off.
[02:33:34.065 --> 02:33:37.286]  Because that's totally a reasonable punishment, isn't it?
[02:33:37.326 --> 02:33:38.487]  For flipping somebody off.
[02:33:38.847 --> 02:33:39.968]  To ruin their lives.
[02:33:41.149 --> 02:33:41.589]  Forever.
[02:33:42.270 --> 02:33:46.612]  To have people track them down, get their home address, get their license registration.
[02:33:47.572 --> 02:33:48.913]  It's totally equitable, isn't it?
[02:33:49.553 --> 02:33:56.236]  This guy, in a tit-for-tat move, his employer Postmates has now been contacted by people on Twitter.
[02:33:56.616 --> 02:34:01.839]  In fact, Postmates on their officially verified Twitter account responded and said they're looking into it.
[02:34:02.819 --> 02:34:04.260]  So again, this is going to escalate.
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:06.161]  You're going to get this tit-for-tat situation.
[02:34:07.061 --> 02:34:09.242]  Someone responded to this incident on Twitter
[02:34:09.853 --> 02:34:15.316]  By saying, if she didn't want to be followed home, she shouldn't have been an S-H-I-T-T-Y human being.
[02:34:15.996 --> 02:34:19.137]  She could have easily rolled down the window, waved and said, have a wonderful day.
[02:34:19.678 --> 02:34:25.320]  So, because she flipped somebody off in a moment of anger in traffic, her life needs to be ruined.
[02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:25.701]  No.
[02:34:26.841 --> 02:34:28.202]  Mike Cernovich responded to that.
[02:34:28.222 --> 02:34:35.005]  He said, if she didn't want to be followed home, the far left is outright signing on to stalking and rape culture.
[02:34:35.405 --> 02:34:38.787]  That's exactly what it is and it happens on Twitter on a daily basis.
[02:34:39.733 --> 02:34:50.729]  Meanwhile, on Facebook, Daily Caller reports Project Veritas Video shows Facebook content moderators discussing censoring conservatives reveals exception given to Don Lemon for hate speech.
[02:34:50.769 --> 02:34:54.754]  And also, by the way, one moderator had quoted that she tweets
[02:34:56.508 --> 02:34:58.950]  Trump supporters who wear MAGA hats as terrorists!
[02:34:59.410 --> 02:35:01.431]  Sounds very neutral, non-partisan, doesn't it?
[02:35:01.932 --> 02:35:05.774]  As Mark Zuckerberg claimed to Ted Cruz during that hearing.
[02:35:06.314 --> 02:35:14.800]  Facebook content moderators discuss using their positions to censor Republicans and conservatives in an undercover video released by activist group Project Veritas on Tuesday.
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:15.620]  We have it right now.
[02:35:16.121 --> 02:35:16.681]  Here it is.
[02:35:21.864 --> 02:35:22.505]  Are you afraid?
[02:35:24.167 --> 02:35:26.368]  I think the truth is more powerful than any NDA.
[02:35:29.310 --> 02:35:32.231]  It's a very progressive company who's very anti-MAGA.
[02:35:32.251 --> 02:35:34.272]  I think they're very biased with who they protect.
[02:35:35.693 --> 02:35:43.276]  Facebook's notorious for it, and they say they don't, but it's clear that people's content don't come out because it's been de-filtered off the queue.
[02:35:44.317 --> 02:35:45.197]  They're doing something, man.
[02:35:45.217 --> 02:35:46.558]  They're just trying to pretend like they're not.
[02:35:48.219 --> 02:35:52.261]  To me, censorship online is one of the biggest issues facing us in the lead-up to the 2020 election.
[02:35:53.305 --> 02:35:54.266]  Let me run something by you.
[02:35:54.386 --> 02:35:56.907]  You know that civic harassment queue that we've been in lately?
[02:35:57.267 --> 02:35:57.727]  Yeah.
[02:35:58.248 --> 02:36:00.449]  Is it just me or is it like all Republicans in there?
[02:36:00.629 --> 02:36:01.429]  It's all Republicans.
[02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:06.072]  But a lot of it comes off the Trump's page specifically.
[02:36:06.232 --> 02:36:15.637]  So for 75 to 80 percent of the posts to be targeting Republicans and conservatives, you can say it was a bot, but somebody had to design that algorithm.
[02:36:16.117 --> 02:36:16.598]  So really,
[02:36:17.631 --> 02:36:18.432]  Somebody at Facebook.
[02:36:18.532 --> 02:36:22.274]  Like, if you see a conservative post, you just get rid of it, right?
[02:36:22.314 --> 02:36:22.454]  Yes!
[02:36:22.594 --> 02:36:23.575]  I don't give no f***.
[02:36:23.615 --> 02:36:24.175]  I'll delete it.
[02:36:44.426 --> 02:36:51.734]  We were told to leave this image up as long as it didn't say, oh, I'm going to actually kill Donald Trump or something like that.
[02:36:52.162 --> 02:36:54.264]  So you've deleted just hashtag MAGA?
[02:36:54.284 --> 02:36:54.704]  Yeah.
[02:36:54.784 --> 02:36:55.565]  Like the post's gone?
[02:36:55.645 --> 02:36:57.967]  It's coming soon.
[02:36:58.427 --> 02:37:03.592]  A lot of people are taking down, you know, some post stuff.
[02:37:03.612 --> 02:37:04.773]  Yeah, I knew that too.
[02:37:04.873 --> 02:37:06.494]  I was like, you know what?
[02:37:06.514 --> 02:37:08.776]  I'm not going to hold you accountable for taking it down.
[02:37:09.437 --> 02:37:10.177]  So it's been better?
[02:37:10.738 --> 02:37:12.399]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:12.419 --> 02:37:14.021]  You gotta do the Cheeto at all.
[02:37:18.525 --> 02:37:24.970]  How many of you are, like, take your own stance and say, we're just deleting whatever, all the Trump posts?
[02:37:24.990 --> 02:37:26.691]  There's only probably, like, 16 of us.
[02:37:28.513 --> 02:37:30.214]  And you guys, like, you just delete everyone?
[02:37:30.254 --> 02:37:30.434]  Yeah.
[02:37:30.514 --> 02:37:39.721]  I know that Facebook does have a Trump rule where they still allow him on the platform, even though he says things that, if anyone else said it.
[02:37:40.562 --> 02:37:46.947]  And that's, that's the fortunate thing is, even if he does say something, if it gets repeated, we can at least get the average job.
[02:37:53.049 --> 02:38:02.758]  Trump supporters like to throw around like Trump derangement syndrome.
[02:38:02.798 --> 02:38:02.999]  Yeah.
[02:38:03.159 --> 02:38:04.880]  As like, you know, liberals being crazy.
[02:38:05.321 --> 02:38:08.844]  I like to think of it as actually you're the one that has Trump derangement syndrome.
[02:38:08.864 --> 02:38:13.088]  You're losing your god damn mind as soon as, because they're just like, Trump 2029.
[02:38:13.289 --> 02:38:13.529]  Yeah.
[02:38:13.669 --> 02:38:16.552]  And it's like, that sounds a little more deranged to me.
[02:38:25.137 --> 02:38:33.742]  So you listen to that, you listen to them saying people with MAGA hats were treated as terrorists, they deleted pro-Trump posts at their own behest on a whim.
[02:38:34.243 --> 02:38:44.429]  Zuckerberg got up in front of a committee back in April 2018 and said Facebook was trying to make sure that we don't have any bias in the work that we do.
[02:38:44.829 --> 02:38:48.051]  Does it really sound like they've made a lot of progress in over two years?
[02:38:48.111 --> 02:38:49.012]  Remember Facebook
[02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:55.703]  They put me on a list with drug cartels, sex traffickers and serial killers.
[02:38:55.743 --> 02:39:02.347]  And not only that, they then told their user base that it was okay to incite and plan violence against me.
[02:39:03.208 --> 02:39:08.351]  Because the people on that list were exempted from planning violence on their platform.
[02:39:08.391 --> 02:39:15.255]  So they literally put out a fatwa saying that it was okay to plan violence against me on Facebook because they put me on a list.
[02:39:16.007 --> 02:39:19.090]  With drug cartels, sex traffickers and serial killers.
[02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:20.971]  Oh, but it's non-bias!
[02:39:21.612 --> 02:39:23.934]  Because they had to remove that a couple of days later.
[02:39:24.294 --> 02:39:27.717]  The fact that they even put it on there in the first place is absolutely chilly.
[02:39:29.178 --> 02:39:35.063]  Meanwhile, RT reports Noose in Bubba Wallace's garage may have been a benign pull rope.
[02:39:35.123 --> 02:39:37.164]  Twitter pundits argue, showing video evidence.
[02:39:37.205 --> 02:39:41.168]  And in fact, we've got a Mark Dice clip on this, which we're going to roll here in a second.
[02:39:42.654 --> 02:39:48.895]  Of course, this is the controversy over NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace, who claimed they'd found a noose in his garage.
[02:39:49.416 --> 02:40:01.278]  The noose purportedly hanging in NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace's garage may have actually been a rope used to close the door of the carport Internet sleuths have argued, citing videos and photographs of the alleged crime.
[02:40:01.318 --> 02:40:03.679]  Let's see a Mark Dice lay this out in this clip.
[02:40:04.199 --> 02:40:05.120]  Right now, here it is.
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:29.351]  I can't say with 100% certainty at this point, but I would give it a 99.9% chance that the supposed noose found in the NASCAR garage of Bubba Wallace was this garage pull shown on the official NASCAR YouTube channel during one of their garage cam walkthroughs of the Talladega Super Speedway in Alabama
[02:40:29.791 --> 02:40:36.334]  Where Bubba Wallace's crew supposedly found the noose that somebody left in his garage.
[02:40:36.914 --> 02:40:50.320]  The moment I first heard about the noose, I figured it was just an extension cord coiled up and hung on the wall, or an air compressor hose, or a tow rope, and because of the hysteria, somebody mistook it for a hate symbol.
[02:40:50.748 --> 02:40:58.135]  Just like somebody did at Michigan State University when the noose that they found turned out to be just a broken shoelace.
[02:40:59.055 --> 02:41:05.421]  Or like the nooses found in an Oakland park which just turned out to be exercise equipment.
[02:41:06.202 --> 02:41:16.391]  Or the KKK rally that a student thought they saw through the window at Bowling Green State University which turned out to be some lab equipment that had plastic coverings over it.
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:26.501]  So this sounds like yet another Jussie Smollett style media contrived hate crime hoax.
[02:41:26.541 --> 02:41:30.782]  And in fact there's a tweet which I retweeted earlier from an account called The Last Refuge.
[02:41:31.362 --> 02:41:39.904]  He makes a comparison shot of this garage from the outside, the same garage, from November 2019 and June 2020.
[02:41:40.384 --> 02:41:44.125]  And the rope is in the same position on both images.
[02:41:44.713 --> 02:41:54.196]  The only difference being in the June 2020 shot, the bottom part of the rope, the noose, which is actually a thing to draw down the garage door, has been removed.
[02:41:54.276 --> 02:41:57.197]  So this is quickly falling apart.
[02:41:58.057 --> 02:42:00.978]  Another contrived hate crime hoax by the looks of it.
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:15.523]  We're going to come back in the next segment and talk about the Reading terrorist attack, which happened in the UK on Saturday night, which is basically already being forgotten about by the mainstream media once again, because it doesn't fit their narrative.
[02:42:15.623 --> 02:42:17.084]  Breaking news at Summit.News.
[02:42:17.264 --> 02:42:17.904]  Don't go away.
[02:42:18.424 --> 02:42:19.144]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:20.344 --> 02:42:20.785]  We are back.
[02:42:20.825 --> 02:42:24.405]  I'm going to talk about the terror attack in Reading, UK over the weekend.

[02:43:16.338 --> 02:43:16.398]  Now,
[02:43:19.853 --> 02:43:35.977]  Going back to 2011 of course we had the completely disastrous intervention in Libya toppling a secular leader yet again in Colonel Gaddafi and opening up a vacuum for Islamic extremists and warlords to take control of the country.
[02:43:36.637 --> 02:43:43.779]  Now I made this point in regard to the Reading terror attack, the connection to which I'll get on to in a moment, on a couple of days ago I believe it was.
[02:43:44.279 --> 02:43:44.979]  Someone responded
[02:43:45.976 --> 02:43:51.641]  Because I blamed Hillary Clinton and Obama for approving this disastrous regime change in Libya.
[02:43:51.701 --> 02:43:52.542]  They were behind it.
[02:43:52.602 --> 02:43:54.343]  They were the main progenitors behind it.
[02:43:54.703 --> 02:43:58.547]  Ended up with black people literally being imprisoned in concentration camps.
[02:43:59.427 --> 02:44:01.809]  No Black Lives Matter protests after that occurred.
[02:44:02.170 --> 02:44:07.334]  But somebody responded, the intervention in Libya was in support of UN Security Council Resolution 1973.
[02:44:08.982 --> 02:44:17.430]  Okay, the intervention in Libya led to the rise of ISIS, it led to the migrant crisis, and it led to numerous terror attacks around the West.
[02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:27.760]  Including, by the way, the Paris Massacre, a number of culprits of which abused the migrant-refugee wave to get into Europe in the first place.
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:34.166]  And in fact, ISIS bragged about how they did that in their own magazine, De Beek, and we've covered that before.
[02:44:34.952 --> 02:44:42.535]  So it led to numerous terror attacks, it led to the rise of ISIS, the spread of ISIS, and of course the migrant crisis that continues to affect us today.
[02:44:42.875 --> 02:44:44.536]  It was a disastrous intervention.
[02:44:45.236 --> 02:44:51.578]  It was at the behest of Hillary Clinton, who literally cackled when they told her Gaddafi was dead, and Barack Obama.
[02:44:51.598 --> 02:44:57.081]  It ended up with warlords controlling the country, a complete cesspit, black people in concentration camps.
[02:44:57.481 --> 02:45:01.722]  It was horrendous, and we're still feeling the after effects to this day.
[02:45:02.343 --> 02:45:02.823]  Headline!
[02:45:03.371 --> 02:45:10.256]  He was defending himself from racist UK claims brother of Reading terrorists who stabbed three people to death.
[02:45:11.196 --> 02:45:21.643]  So what happened on Saturday evening was that people were enjoying the sunshine, having picnics, having barbecues in a park in Reading, which is a town about an hour away from London.
[02:45:22.341 --> 02:45:26.505]  And this person walks up to them and starts stabbing them in the neck.
[02:45:26.945 --> 02:45:28.907]  Now, where was this individual from?
[02:45:28.987 --> 02:45:30.188]  Take a wild guess.
[02:45:30.228 --> 02:45:34.711]  Yes, he was from Libya, he was an asylum seeker, he was a refugee.
[02:45:34.952 --> 02:45:41.577]  He was brought into the country as a result of the overthrow of Gaddafi and the power vacuum in Libya.
[02:45:41.837 --> 02:45:49.484]  He would not have been in the country stabbing people in the neck, stabbing people under the arm on a pleasant summer's evening in Reading,
[02:45:50.084 --> 02:45:52.046]  Unless we had brought him into the country.
[02:45:52.346 --> 02:45:54.047]  Unless we had overthrown Gaddafi.
[02:45:54.928 --> 02:45:56.750]  Oh, but Gaddafi tortured some people.
[02:45:57.050 --> 02:45:59.852]  Okay, you want to compare that to what's happened since?
[02:46:00.233 --> 02:46:03.855]  How many people did ISIS kill over the past five, six years?
[02:46:05.197 --> 02:46:09.360]  But according to the terrorist brother, he was just defending himself.
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:10.861]  And you can believe that.
[02:46:11.642 --> 02:46:12.803]  In fact, Sky News
[02:46:13.991 --> 02:46:15.472]  They do this every time.
[02:46:15.893 --> 02:46:23.840]  They go and talk to the family of the terrorist and devote an entire article to them saying, oh he was a good boy, he was just a bit mentally confused.
[02:46:24.821 --> 02:46:36.692]  In fact, Douglas Murray writes to The Spectator, what isn't being said about the Reading terror attack victims, imagine if on a Saturday evening a white neo-Nazi had stabbed three men to death.
[02:46:37.285 --> 02:46:42.230]  Imagine, furthermore, if in the wake of the killings it had turned out that all three of the victims were gay.
[02:46:42.771 --> 02:46:52.381]  Because yes, by the way, all three fatalities, he stabbed about six people total, if not more, but the three fatalities were all LGBT.
[02:46:52.801 --> 02:46:58.187]  Not a big uproar about that in the LGBT community in terms of why they were targeted,
[02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.950]  He goes on to say,
[02:47:17.768 --> 02:47:29.832]  And we've had a lot of attacks of people coming out of gay nightclubs who get slashed and the story disappears a couple of days later, but they don't really want to look into it because, again, it doesn't fit the narrative.
[02:47:29.872 --> 02:47:37.595]  If it was a white neo-Nazi stabbing three gay people to death on a Saturday afternoon, you can bet that would be the narrative the next day.
[02:47:37.875 --> 02:47:42.576]  But because this guy was a refugee, now it's completely disappeared.
[02:47:42.977 --> 02:47:47.198]  We've got Premier League multimillionaire footballers taking a knee
[02:47:48.092 --> 02:47:56.599]  Before each game, they didn't even do it once, they're doing it before each game, over a guy who was killed in America 4,000 miles away.
[02:47:57.540 --> 02:48:01.743]  One person of colour was killed in the entire UK in the entire year of 2019.
[02:48:02.944 --> 02:48:08.289]  He was the London Bridge terrorist, yet we've got Premiership footballers taking a knee for that.
[02:48:09.029 --> 02:48:12.793]  Who's going to take a knee for the victims of the Reading terror attack?
[02:48:13.033 --> 02:48:14.054]  Absolutely nobody.
[02:48:14.114 --> 02:48:14.334]  In fact,
[02:48:15.285 --> 02:48:20.328]  I don't even know if they had a minute's silence before all the football games over the past couple of days.
[02:48:20.648 --> 02:48:22.589]  They certainly did for Black Lives Matter.
[02:48:23.569 --> 02:48:33.754]  Kind of ironic that a giant multi-billion enterprise like the Premier League is taking a knee for violent revolutionaries who literally want to overthrow capitalism.
[02:48:34.755 --> 02:48:41.458]  But according to the terrorist brother, I'm wrong and he was just defending himself because the UK's racist.
[02:48:42.597 --> 02:48:44.738]  Because that's what people really should be doing, isn't it?
[02:48:44.798 --> 02:48:47.659]  If they feel offended by something going out stabbing people in the neck.
[02:48:47.899 --> 02:48:51.100]  Totally rational response.
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:57.242]  25-year-old Cariri Sadalo was arrested after launching a vicious attack on a group of people in a park around 7pm.
[02:48:58.423 --> 02:48:59.363]  Again, this was Saturday.
[02:48:59.683 --> 02:49:02.484]  Killing three and injuring three others as he stabbed them in the neck.
[02:49:03.064 --> 02:49:06.025]  Authorities quickly concluded that the incident was a terrorist attack.
[02:49:06.445 --> 02:49:10.787]  By the way, this happened two hours after a BLM protest in the same area.
[02:49:11.491 --> 02:49:15.034]  And later carried out a raid and a controlled explosion at the suspect's home.
[02:49:16.175 --> 02:49:22.661]  And the first hour or two, the media was... First of all, they were very keen to stress that this had nothing to do with BLM.
[02:49:23.001 --> 02:49:32.330]  Now, I'm sure they'd afford the same kind of treatment to a right-wing rally or an anti-lockdown rally if a stabbing of six people occurred two hours after.
[02:49:32.610 --> 02:49:34.852]  I'm sure they'd afford us the same treatment.
[02:49:35.771 --> 02:49:47.713]  So it's nothing to do with BLM, but then they started saying it wasn't even a terrorist attack, even as the riot police, the armed riot police, were raiding the suspect's home and carrying out controlled explosions.
[02:49:48.913 --> 02:49:51.654]  Of course, now they're saying he was just mentally ill, of course, every single time.
[02:49:52.434 --> 02:50:04.376]  However, the terrorist brother responded to the news story on Facebook by claiming that his sibling was a victim of racism and that he was merely defending himself by stabbing three people to death.
[02:50:06.155 --> 02:50:10.037]  Mo Sadala, the brother of the terrorists, said, quote, this is not true.
[02:50:10.657 --> 02:50:12.098]  Kyrie defended himself.
[02:50:12.518 --> 02:50:13.599]  Racist countries.
[02:50:13.979 --> 02:50:15.340]  Freedom for my brother before.
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:22.864]  And then he went on to say, we are not terrorists, or terrorists, as he wrote, and F England.
[02:50:24.185 --> 02:50:27.526]  So another really well integrated migrant there, obviously.
[02:50:27.546 --> 02:50:32.169]  20-year-old eyewitness Lawrence Watt described the horror that unfolded during the attack.
[02:50:33.263 --> 02:50:39.665]  He said, suddenly someone shouted some intelligible words, and went round a large group of around ten, trying to stab them.
[02:50:40.285 --> 02:50:43.186]  Again, we don't know if they were targeted because they were gay.
[02:50:43.646 --> 02:50:45.127]  How he knew they were gay, I don't know.
[02:50:45.187 --> 02:50:51.349]  Maybe they were a couple, maybe they were physically close to each other, but no one's asking that question, so nobody knows.
[02:50:52.509 --> 02:50:57.951]  He stabbed three of them severely in the neck and under the arms, and then turned and started running towards me, and we turned and started running.
[02:50:58.991 --> 02:51:02.132]  When he realised he couldn't catch us, he tried to stab another group, sat down.
[02:51:02.839 --> 02:51:09.081]  Imagine you're in the park with your friends having a barbecue and some lunatic runs up and stabs them in the neck.
[02:51:09.121 --> 02:51:17.484]  You'd think that'd be a pretty big story for the UK where, in comparison to America, we don't really get a ton of fatalities in terms of these stabbings.
[02:51:17.504 --> 02:51:20.125]  A lot of people are stabbed, a lot of inter-gang warfare happens.
[02:51:21.125 --> 02:51:28.568]  A summer's afternoon in a park, people having barbecues, celebrating being stabbed to death by a terrorist, doesn't really happen that often.
[02:51:28.788 --> 02:51:30.748]  As of late, you'd think this would be a bigger story.
[02:51:30.788 --> 02:51:31.089]  It's not.
[02:51:31.109 --> 02:51:32.129]  It's already disappeared.
[02:51:33.143 --> 02:51:34.143]  Why has it disappeared?
[02:51:35.124 --> 02:51:42.566]  Because the terrorist arrived in the UK, claiming to be a tourist back in 2012, or 20... Yeah, it was 2012.
[02:51:43.346 --> 02:51:50.008]  Claiming that his life was threatened by Islamists in Libya, although he also said he fought for ISIS, which is kind of contradictory.
[02:51:51.389 --> 02:51:57.631]  Who, of course, took over the country after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama oversaw regime change and the fall of Colonel Gaddafi.
[02:51:57.931 --> 02:51:59.891]  Oh, but the UN said it was okay!
[02:52:00.472 --> 02:52:01.572]  No, it was horrendous.
[02:52:02.509 --> 02:52:18.401]  The United Kingdom doesn't have a very good history with Libyan refugees, because I hesitate to remind you, the Manchester bomber who blew up 23 people, half of them children, at an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017, guess where he came from?
[02:52:18.802 --> 02:52:20.503]  Yes, he came from Libya.
[02:52:20.803 --> 02:52:30.451]  He was literally given a taxi escort service into the country by the Royal Navy in August 2014, because he was a refugee.
[02:52:31.187 --> 02:52:33.030]  That invasion was disastrous.
[02:52:33.191 --> 02:52:34.753]  It continues to be so.
[02:52:35.234 --> 02:52:36.396]  That's going to wrap it up for now.
[02:52:36.436 --> 02:52:37.718]  War room next week though in Shire.
[02:52:37.938 --> 02:52:39.020]  Breaking news at Summit.News.
[02:52:39.441 --> 02:52:39.902]  Don't go away.
[02:52:51.070 --> 02:52:57.294]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive Deep Earth Crystal nascent iodine.
[02:52:57.895 --> 02:53:00.316]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[02:53:00.997 --> 02:53:06.040]  Introducing the first of its kind nascent iodine spray made with true atomic iodine.
[02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:16.867]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[02:53:17.487 --> 02:53:25.754]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health, as well as a healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[02:53:26.594 --> 02:53:30.677]  Our newest product is now 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:54:03.546 --> 02:54:04.447]  Where did it come from?
[02:54:08.911 --> 02:54:10.853]  Infowarsstore.com.

[02:54:47.670 --> 02:54:49.993]  Other systems, just don't compare.
[02:55:04.724 --> 02:55:08.747]  Go to InfoWars.com and get the TurboForce.
[02:55:08.907 --> 02:55:09.848]  I work long hours.
[02:55:09.928 --> 02:55:11.929]  I work 18-19 hours a day sometimes.
[02:55:11.989 --> 02:55:15.832]  Sometimes I work 24 hours because we're so short-handed with the coronavirus.
[02:55:15.872 --> 02:55:17.213]  People don't want to come to work.
[02:55:17.393 --> 02:55:19.935]  But some people are just taking an option and I'm cool with that.
[02:55:19.975 --> 02:55:21.757]  But anyways, I take the TurboForce.
[02:55:21.837 --> 02:55:24.098]  He's got a product called TurboForce All Natural.
[02:55:24.138 --> 02:55:26.600]  Man, the energy is amazing.
[02:55:26.700 --> 02:55:29.663]  I get about 10 hours worth of just sustained energy.
[02:55:29.803 --> 02:55:30.943]  Sustained energy.
[02:55:31.844 --> 02:55:33.245]  I'm recommending these websites.
[02:55:33.266 --> 02:55:35.708]  I'm recommending these products not because I get paid.
[02:55:35.728 --> 02:55:37.610]  I don't get a referral fee or anything like that.
[02:55:38.110 --> 02:55:39.551]  This is just my personal experience.
[02:55:39.591 --> 02:55:43.875]  I know their brands, but their brands and their websites, they're very famous.
[02:55:43.936 --> 02:55:45.037]  A lot of people know who they are.
[02:55:45.157 --> 02:55:48.220]  I take products from people that I've been listening to for years.
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:50.662]  And I've been listening to InfoWars.com for years.
[02:55:50.682 --> 02:55:53.605]  I've been listening to Dr. Groot for years and years.
[02:55:54.165 --> 02:55:58.828]  I've taken a lot of supplements from other companies, other places, and a lot of that crap is snake oil.
[02:55:58.948 --> 02:56:00.089]  Believe me, snake oil.
[02:56:00.169 --> 02:56:03.872]  But the TurboForce, I take that and I'm good for the entire day.
[02:56:03.892 --> 02:56:05.653]  I'm good for like 12, 13 hours.
[02:56:05.773 --> 02:56:06.293]  At least.
[02:56:06.393 --> 02:56:07.914]  But anyways, I can't speak enough to it.
[02:56:07.954 --> 02:56:08.995]  Working long hours.
[02:56:09.275 --> 02:56:09.896]  I need it.
[02:56:10.056 --> 02:56:10.736]  I need it.
[02:56:10.816 --> 02:56:11.577]  TurboForce.
[02:56:12.317 --> 02:56:13.018]  Infowars.com.
[02:56:22.967 --> 02:56:25.388]  The black lives killed by black men matter, right?
[02:56:27.049 --> 02:56:27.349]  Yes?
[02:56:28.630 --> 02:56:31.431]  The black babies killed in the abortion clinics matter, right?
[02:56:32.531 --> 02:56:33.051]  Thought so.
[02:56:33.712 --> 02:56:38.814]  The black officers killed by that bastard in Minnesota, that matters too, right?
[02:56:39.734 --> 02:56:40.115]  Okay.
[02:56:40.415 --> 02:56:43.896]  But the black babies that are killed in the abortion clinics don't matter, do they?
[02:56:44.436 --> 02:56:45.137]  Medical people.
[02:56:46.497 --> 02:56:47.558]  Do their lives matter?
[02:56:48.798 --> 02:56:50.919]  Does the future of our black babies matter?
[02:56:52.020 --> 02:56:52.320]  Huh?
[02:56:52.836 --> 02:56:53.336]  What's up?
[02:56:53.696 --> 02:56:54.097]  What's up?
[02:56:54.157 --> 02:56:55.557]  Awful quiet now, aren't they?
[02:56:56.297 --> 02:56:56.778]  Uh-huh.
[02:56:57.518 --> 02:56:59.679]  It's okay if we kill them in the womb, right?
[02:57:01.419 --> 02:57:05.701]  But you have a problem when we... You don't seem to really have a problem when we kill them on the streets.
[02:57:06.693 --> 02:57:08.714]  Yes, well we know they're the same issue.
[02:57:09.034 --> 02:57:18.216]  If we don't respect the lives of our unborn children enough to save them and fight for them, our lives mean nothing once we're born.
[02:57:18.296 --> 02:57:25.758]  Well we at InfoWars completely agree, and that's why we have decided to launch the Baby Lives Matter
[02:57:26.378 --> 02:57:31.679]  Onesie and Baby Lives Matter t-shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:31.780 --> 02:57:33.800]  And why is this so important?
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:34.980]  Why is this message so important?
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:46.223]  Well, not only do you support the broadcast when you purchase the Baby Lives Matter onesie or t-shirt, you also fight back against the false narrative or false pandering that the left does when they say Black Lives Matter.
[02:57:46.283 --> 02:57:48.324]  But they ignore all the black-on-black violence.
[02:57:48.384 --> 02:57:50.684]  They ignore the black police officers that get murdered.
[02:57:50.985 --> 02:57:52.325]  In America, if you're black,
[02:57:52.825 --> 02:57:56.853]  The odds of you being killed in the womb are higher than being killed by a police officer.
[02:57:57.214 --> 02:58:01.683]  The odds of you being killed by another black man are higher than you being killed by a police officer.
[02:58:01.984 --> 02:58:02.845]  But none of that matters!
[02:58:04.864 --> 02:58:20.124]  None of that matters because the Democrat Party has to fundraise, and in order to fundraise they have to lie to their voters and deceive them into thinking they're oppressed victims so that you give them money to help the problem that they've been claiming that they're going to fix for 50 years, when the truth is they're actually behind all of it.
[02:58:20.144 --> 02:58:22.467]  But that's why the Baby Lives Matter t-shirt
[02:58:22.927 --> 02:58:33.130]  is such art and such a perfect message for this time because are you gonna have people telling you that black lives matter but then ignore Planned Parenthood murdering tens of millions of black babies?
[02:58:33.250 --> 02:58:43.394]  But just in general the fact that we abort our own children and then pretend to care about life anytime it works as a pandering to the Democrat Party virtue signal.
