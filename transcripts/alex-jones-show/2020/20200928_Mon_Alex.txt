[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:15.775]  Now we have this research paper which was published by Tablet Magazine, headline research shows deliberate Chinese propaganda campaign forced world into lockdown, where attorney and researcher Michael P. Senger documents in extreme detail
[00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:29.031]  Now the Chinese government launched an aggressive propaganda campaign to exaggerate the severity of coronavirus in order to force the rest of the world into a draconian lockdown that would serve to benefit Beijing.
[00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:34.397]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.674 --> 00:00:47.660]  This morning, when I got up at 5.30 and read the Paul Joseph Watson article and then clicked on the actual document, I had electrical chills run up and down my spine for about three minutes.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.822]  I've never had it run up my spine for more than ten seconds.
[00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:56.205]  Because in the document was the absolute keys to total victory over the New World Order.
[00:01:00.302 --> 00:01:04.686]  We're going to be talking about that coming up in just a minute, but this ties into all of it.
[00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:08.649]  This is Pelosi now almost three months ago.
[00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.535]  She's now officially come out and stated this again with specifics, saying she's going to be the president.
[00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:15.996]  Yes, you heard me right.
[00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:19.259]  But here she is giving you a little prelude to it a few months ago.
[00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:23.730]  Whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving.
[00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:34.861]  Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected President of the United States.
[00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:40.586]  I'm second in line to the presidency and just last week I had my
[00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:45.489]  Regular continuation of government briefing.
[00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.791]  This might interest you because it's, I say to them, this is never going to happen.
[00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:51.232]  God willing, it never will.
[00:01:51.592 --> 00:01:52.813]  But there is a process.
[00:01:53.093 --> 00:02:03.178]  It has nothing to do with that the certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency.
[00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:06.000]  It's not geography or location.
[00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:09.486]  And then a few weeks later, we get the Podesta document.
[00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.150]  The New York Times is proud of it, that they're planning to break the country up.
[00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:13.532]  I know they're gonna lose.
[00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:16.296]  And now it's official, Pelosi came out last night.
[00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:22.521]  Nancy Pelosi prepares for House of Representatives vote to elect the president under the Constitution.
[00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:34.992]  If they cannot decide the election according to problems with the voting by January 20th, then they will hold a vote the day after on who the new president is, and the House of Representatives will elect the president.
[00:02:35.432 --> 00:02:38.515]  That's never happened before in our 244 years of history, but here it is.
[00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:38.675]  Voila!
[00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:42.999]  And so that's one of their main plans.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:03:01.076]  Or if they can fiasco it and make it look like Biden wins and have enough martial law and enough tyranny and enough burning cities and enough stock market plunge for somehow Trump to be removed by a military coup, then they'll install Biden and Harris and then he'll step aside and then whoever Harris brings in will end up being the president or vice president.
[00:03:02.113 --> 00:03:04.715]  And it's the corrupt party that wants people to manage all of that.
[00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:09.917]  So that's why it represents really the further decline of the republic to a great extent.
[00:03:09.998 --> 00:03:12.759]  Now, that's obviously a big enchilada right there.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.323]  Mainstream news, New York Times, Pelosi prepares to elect the president, which she says is herself.
[00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:25.566]  She says in the same interview we just played a clip of that she is in second command and she's going to be in charge of everything.
[00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:26.307]  This is
[00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:32.972]  Over the top, megalomania, never before seen in our history, and we're living it.
[00:03:33.253 --> 00:03:37.056]  We are living the most insane times in our country's history.
[00:03:38.157 --> 00:03:41.900]  There is absolutely no doubt about it.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.742]  Now, that's big, and we're going to be covering it.
[00:03:45.343 --> 00:03:46.744]  We got James O'Keefe coming on.
[00:03:46.764 --> 00:03:48.225]  We got David Icke coming on.
[00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:56.412]  They had Billy Club wielding police attack 20-something thousand people having their anti-COVID lockdown event in London.
[00:03:57.722 --> 00:04:01.423]  On Saturday, we also have Paul Joseph Watson, who's in London.
[00:04:01.443 --> 00:04:03.003]  He'll be joining us as well.
[00:04:03.303 --> 00:04:10.925]  He always hosts part of the Tuesday show, but he'll be joining us coming up at 1 o'clock today.
[00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:13.826]  So this is just going to be a staggering transmission.
[00:04:14.746 --> 00:04:19.307]  And by staggering, speaking of Paul Joseph Watson, I just got to chill again.
[00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:25.749]  I already knew all this, but then when I sat there drinking coffee, reading
[00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:28.129]  Let's not exaggerate.
[00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:30.170]  I probably read 50 pages of the documents.
[00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.631]  I scanned over another couple hundred, and I already knew pretty much all of it, but I didn't know some of it.
[00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:48.754]  I didn't even know the FBI has come out and admitted, usually the deaf, dumb, and blind FBI, that Communist China is using COVID to try to destabilize the U.S.
[00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:52.655]  I mean, everybody knows that, but to have them occasionally tell the truth is just shocking.
[00:04:54.224 --> 00:05:00.193]  But the article is, research shows deliberate Chinese propaganda campaign forced world into lockdown.
[00:05:01.337 --> 00:05:10.043]  With cohorts of the UN and the liberal media, and then here's the actual detailed report from Tablet Magazine with researchers and top lawyers that put it together over the last six months.
[00:05:10.403 --> 00:05:12.524]  China's global lockdown propaganda campaign.
[00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:17.788]  This is the smoking gun that will end this whole tyranny that they're rolling out.
[00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:23.191]  The apps on your phone, the contact tracing, the bankruptcy, the third world starving to death, the tyranny.
[00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:24.332]  It's just incredible.
[00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:26.153]  The left needs to go to prison for this.
[00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:28.895]  We knew 2020 was going to be epic.
[00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:31.528]  Man, not this epic.
[00:05:32.328 --> 00:05:47.284]  I am constantly having chills now, and I liken that to the allegory of Lord of the Rings when they've got the elf sword, the goblin cleaver, but when goblins are near it starts glowing blue.
[00:05:47.845 --> 00:05:48.025]  That's
[00:05:49.113 --> 00:05:57.399]  An archetype of our spirit glowing and shimmering when it feels evil nearby, and also when you know you've got a chance to bring the enemy down.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:06.086]  Your spirit resonates, tells you, danger, danger, or tells you, this is key, this is key, this is how we destroy them, this is the truth.
[00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:10.209]  And I've never experienced this electrifying sense.
[00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.830]  Like I'm having now.
[00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.371]  I mean, it's been... I'm probably electrified an hour a day.
[00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:17.332]  I used to be electrified maybe an hour a month.
[00:06:17.832 --> 00:06:18.792]  Little pieces here and there.
[00:06:19.132 --> 00:06:22.233]  And now today, I've been electrified for hours.
[00:06:23.253 --> 00:06:24.073]  Electrified.
[00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:30.255]  Because all of our ancestors, all of our fighting, everything we are is leading up towards this point right now.
[00:06:30.435 --> 00:06:39.217]  And our very genetics, and our very epigenetics, our ancestors, all their memories, everything crystallized in our cells, is saying this is important.
[00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:42.672]  This is important.
[00:06:44.013 --> 00:06:52.637]  I can tell you how many people have been walking through the woods and get that shiver up their spine and they just turn perfectly and look up at a tree 30 yards away and there's a mountain lion looking right at them.
[00:06:53.077 --> 00:06:54.117]  That's the sixth sense.
[00:06:54.657 --> 00:06:59.860]  And my spidey sense, and I know your spidey sense, is like blue lightning right now.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.761]  It is on fire!
[00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:07.183]  And of course you can see why it's on fire right in front of you.
[00:07:07.983 --> 00:07:09.564]  It's hard to do the show right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:12.032]  Look at these headlines.
[00:07:13.212 --> 00:07:18.175]  Nancy Pelosi says she will decide who the President of the United States is and may install herself.
[00:07:18.996 --> 00:07:19.456]  Wow.
[00:07:20.397 --> 00:07:20.837]  Wow.
[00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.101]  And then she says we're gonna elect who the President is, the House of Representatives.
[00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:28.321]  She's preparing that.
[00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.602]  She says it will be her.
[00:07:29.622 --> 00:07:34.185]  I even got clips on the news saying we'll have President Pelosi.
[00:07:35.947 --> 00:07:41.191]  They're just introducing you all these foreign, alien, tyrannical ideas of, oh, the military will overthrow Trump.
[00:07:42.432 --> 00:07:43.873]  Oh, white people are inherently evil.
[00:07:44.394 --> 00:07:45.514]  Oh, pedophilia is okay.
[00:07:45.534 --> 00:07:49.698]  They're just searing your consciousness to accept what's coming in the future.
[00:07:49.738 --> 00:07:51.159]  They're preparing you.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.300]  Look at this headline.
[00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:57.103]  Project Veritas Uncovers Ballot Harvesting Fraud in Minnesota.
[00:07:58.584 --> 00:08:02.808]  Smoking gun with Ilhan Omar, the little pirate queen,
[00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:10.305]  And her operatives just celebrating how they piss on America with extreme pleasure.
[00:08:11.046 --> 00:08:13.167]  We love our Somalis.
[00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:14.927]  We love our Muslims too.
[00:08:15.548 --> 00:08:16.488]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:08:16.988 --> 00:08:17.809]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:19.169]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:20.610]  Bombshell after bombshell.
[00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.091]  But all of it ties into this.
[00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:25.312]  The Big Kahuna.
[00:08:28.786 --> 00:08:33.531]  Research shows deliberate Chinese propaganda campaign forced worldwide lockdown.
[00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:36.214]  And we all knew this and we reported this first.
[00:08:38.196 --> 00:08:40.638]  And not soon enough, we even took the bait for a couple of weeks.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.402]  One of my biggest failures in my lifetime.
[00:08:44.942 --> 00:08:46.364]  But we figured it out very, very quickly.
[00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:49.962]  Well, guess what?
[00:08:49.982 --> 00:08:58.304]  When I read the 30-something page detailed report and then linked through to other reports in it, it sent, again, lightning up my spine like I've never experienced.
[00:08:58.724 --> 00:08:59.765]  Because this is the key.
[00:08:59.825 --> 00:09:01.665]  You get this to every FBI office.
[00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:03.846]  You flood Congress with this report.
[00:09:04.286 --> 00:09:05.746]  You hand deliver this to Congress.
[00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:10.007]  You go and just drop printouts of this all around the White House.
[00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:11.768]  Trump will get it.
[00:09:12.228 --> 00:09:13.288]  Trump will talk about it.
[00:09:13.368 --> 00:09:14.748]  And it is ga-ga-ga-game over.
[00:09:20.051 --> 00:09:20.711]  Game over.
[00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:22.072]  I'm going to cover it next segment.
[00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:46.683]  Total proof of how, with the UN, they show the lockdown cities, the drones, most of it was actors, they confirm it's actors, they show where it's actors, how they propagandized, how they use it to shut us down, how China instantly reopened, and how it's a constellation of Chai Koms, the UN, and the deep state leftists worldwide using this to bring in their leftist martial law.
[00:09:47.023 --> 00:09:49.444]  That's why leftist jurisdictions are under the tyranny and others aren't.
[00:09:51.005 --> 00:10:01.688]  So this is all known to you, known to me, but now this very high-powered lawyer and his research team of computer scientists have gone out and most of what's in the report we already knew.
[00:10:03.188 --> 00:10:14.111]  But he's put it all together in one spot and it shows the orchestrated weaponization of this and how this is 21st century warfare.
[00:10:15.052 --> 00:10:17.112]  That's how you take over a civilization.
[00:10:17.612 --> 00:10:19.373]  That's how you take over a society.
[00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:25.619]  Is with a Project Bluebeam.
[00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:27.883]  And what was Project?
[00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.112]  What was Project Bluebeam?
[00:10:37.546 --> 00:10:39.007]  Is a declassified U.S.
[00:10:39.047 --> 00:10:59.717]  government plan, other governments have planned it, to confuse foreign enemies by projecting a 5,000-foot Jesus, 5,000-foot Buddha, 5,000-foot, 2,000-foot, whatever they want, Muhammad, or even flying saucers with high-powered hologram projectors.
[00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:06.401]  Congress confirmed in the 90s that the project did exist, that over $10 million was spent on it.
[00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:08.989]  But that the project was shelved.
[00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:19.195]  In the 1950s, you could go to Disneyland in Los Angeles and go into a famous haunted house and watch ghosts fly around in the room.
[00:11:19.415 --> 00:11:21.236]  That was with primitive holograms.
[00:11:21.977 --> 00:11:35.485]  Well, this is with bio-weapons, a real virus that does kill a small number of people, but then you add in all the others that die, and you create huge fear, and you use it as a pretext to bring in the Global Tracking System, the Casual Society Control Grid,
[00:11:35.805 --> 00:11:42.091]  The global social credit score, that's now all rolled out officially, rolling out in leftist cities around the world, rolling out on universities.
[00:11:42.812 --> 00:11:45.274]  The British government officially said now you're going to have to have the app.
[00:11:45.554 --> 00:11:53.081]  There's no law, but all the stores are already refusing people to be in restaurants, hospitals, stores, if you do not have the app that tracks you in live time.
[00:11:53.521 --> 00:11:54.262]  That's just the beginning.
[00:11:56.084 --> 00:12:01.629]  And so Communist China, working with the globalists, has launched their model worldwide to take over the planet.
[00:12:03.117 --> 00:12:09.079]  And it's just absolutely incredible that they're actually doing this in our face.
[00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:12.200]  There it is, the National Health Service app.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.321]  And they're telling you that you must download it.
[00:12:18.322 --> 00:12:21.523]  This is a recording minutes after it went live, already 100,000 have downloaded it.
[00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:24.904]  And before you could even download it, restaurants were demanding you have it.
[00:12:27.024 --> 00:12:28.705]  So that's how social credit score works.
[00:12:28.745 --> 00:12:31.986]  They get the corporations and everybody to comply with it.
[00:12:34.127 --> 00:12:36.068]  And it makes sure that you stay six feet apart.
[00:12:36.749 --> 00:12:38.950]  It tracks who you are, where you go, what groups you're in.
[00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.252]  The police are now coming to people's doors and saying, we know there's so many people here.
[00:12:42.853 --> 00:12:48.756]  This is beyond 1984, and boom, we're inside of it, all based on the COVID operation.
[00:12:49.096 --> 00:13:02.185]  So if you expose that China and big tech, because notice, big tech took the official Chinese model through the WHO and would not let Congress, would not let medical doctors, would not let scientists, would not let the head of the Rockefeller
[00:13:03.669 --> 00:13:09.332]  Hospital, virology, come out and point out that, hey, herd immunity will end up making us safe in just a few months.
[00:13:09.652 --> 00:13:11.333]  Hey, locking folks up only makes it worse.
[00:13:11.693 --> 00:13:13.974]  Hey, most people are dying of something else, not COVID.
[00:13:14.274 --> 00:13:16.956]  Hey, they're adding people that died of something else on the list.
[00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:19.637]  Hey, you shouldn't send sick people to nursing homes.
[00:13:20.197 --> 00:13:21.478]  Hey, that caused most of the deaths.
[00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:28.201]  Hey, vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc, if you have that, you basically can't die of this type of coronavirus or even the flu virus.
[00:13:29.702 --> 00:13:31.283]  Hey, forced inoculations are coming.
[00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.084]  Hey, this new Bill Gates,
[00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:38.949]  Vaccine goes in and reprograms the cells, and it's super dangerous.
[00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:45.551]  Anyone criticizing that is banned, and they say on the news under WHO.
[00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:47.031]  So there we are under world government.
[00:13:47.291 --> 00:14:01.435]  And here it is, the Chinese, with the actors, with the staged events, with people falling over dead, and whales at night in the cities, and everything empty, and police drones flying around saying, stay in your homes, or you'll be permanently detained.
[00:14:01.835 --> 00:14:04.896]  That shut down Hong Kong and Taiwan that we're trying to pull back from China.
[00:14:05.984 --> 00:14:11.568]  That got their agenda through and now Xi Jinping is hailed in China as launching this as their greatest victory.
[00:14:11.788 --> 00:14:25.857]  And it's a huge military economic victory for Communist China to shut down the United States and Europe and to have their cohorts in Europe and the United States and Canada and Australia use this to clamp down on their own people with authoritarianism.
[00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:28.579]  Absolutely evil.
[00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:32.362]  Research shows deliberate Chinese propaganda campaign forced the world into lockdown.
[00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:49.929]  Researcher and attorney Michael P. Singer show that the Chinese government launched an aggressive propaganda campaign to exaggerate the severity of the coronavirus in order to force the rest of the world into a draconian lockdown that would serve their benefit in Beijing and all other authoritarians.
[00:14:50.369 --> 00:15:02.759]  In an article in Tablet Magazine, he details how the January international COVID-19 hysteria began with a series of suspicious videos posted to social media sites showing people in China suddenly collapsing on the streets, including one instance where a man held out his arm to break his fall.
[00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:05.139]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.680]  That's how they rolled it all out.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.440]  Then they said, oh, China's suppressing.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.341]  How bad it is to make you panic.
[00:15:10.601 --> 00:15:11.241]  See how that works.
[00:15:11.261 --> 00:15:11.761]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:12.581 --> 00:15:13.361]  Thank you.
[00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:14.182]  Thank you.
[00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:34.627]  That people used to laugh at me in the street once.
[00:15:36.308 --> 00:15:40.890]  Speak your truth and the world comes to you.
[00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.813]  Humanity awakens!
[00:15:54.347 --> 00:15:59.010]  We face a big, big challenge.
[00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:08.636]  And it will require enormous courage, unquenchable determination and fortitude.
[00:16:09.196 --> 00:16:12.678]  But we will not crumble!
[00:16:12.998 --> 00:16:15.700]  We will not fail!
[00:16:20.441 --> 00:16:30.185]  People, human family across the world, awaken to who you really are.
[00:16:30.465 --> 00:16:39.349]  Remember, remember who you really are and it's not what they have been telling you.
[00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:53.759]  And what the human family has done is allow the psychopaths to hijack our imagination of ourselves.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.420]  Yes.
[00:16:56.642 --> 00:16:58.763]  The human family is coming together.
[00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:00.405]  We've got our differences.
[00:17:01.165 --> 00:17:02.686]  We've had our fights, but we're humans.
[00:17:02.726 --> 00:17:03.427]  We're red-blooded.
[00:17:04.007 --> 00:17:08.491]  What we're facing is not of this world and seeks to end our reign on this planet.
[00:17:09.438 --> 00:17:10.278]  Not without a fight.
[00:17:11.259 --> 00:17:12.839]  And I know victory will be ours.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.900]  The question is, how many billions are going to die in the process?
[00:17:18.742 --> 00:17:20.822]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:17:22.103 --> 00:17:23.723]  Oh, a lot of people are going to die in this fight.
[00:17:24.584 --> 00:17:27.125]  The question is, is it going to be 500 million or is it going to be 7 billion?
[00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:32.607]  The globalists openly teach they're going to wipe out humanity down to 500 million.
[00:17:32.847 --> 00:17:35.548]  That's so the idiots going along with it think they're going to survive.
[00:17:35.768 --> 00:17:36.708]  They're going to be killed too.
[00:17:37.188 --> 00:17:38.349]  And as soon as they figure it out,
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.581]  A lot of them are going to be forced to join us.
[00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:45.923]  I was talking to one of the crew members this morning about how we're being persecuted behind the scenes.
[00:17:45.943 --> 00:17:46.963]  I'm not ready to reveal it yet.
[00:17:47.023 --> 00:17:57.848]  And how, just like they wouldn't let black folks have bank accounts or eat at certain counters or ride in the front of the bus or go to a movie theater, that's happening to conservatives across the board.
[00:17:57.908 --> 00:17:59.789]  Not just us, but it's really bad for us.
[00:18:00.089 --> 00:18:03.351]  Laura Loomer can't even get Uber Eats or use Uber or get Lyft.
[00:18:05.538 --> 00:18:07.199]  Get an Airbnb if she's in a database.
[00:18:07.279 --> 00:18:07.940]  Do not serve.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.101]  That's set up for everybody.
[00:18:13.123 --> 00:18:13.964]  Rob made a good point.
[00:18:13.984 --> 00:18:18.667]  He said, yeah, well, they'll just start doing it to each other soon and then it'll all fall apart.
[00:18:18.687 --> 00:18:19.308]  And that's true.
[00:18:20.148 --> 00:18:21.149]  Tyranny's for everybody.
[00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.973]  And the idiots that bring it in are usually the ones that get purged by the real evil.
[00:18:27.553 --> 00:18:31.296]  All these dumb leftists bringing in this world government, they're going to get thrown overboard.
[00:18:35.933 --> 00:18:38.836]  Most evidence shows the Communist Party finally killed Mao Zedong.
[00:18:40.718 --> 00:18:43.340]  They actually imprisoned his wife, blamed it all on her.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.645]  The 80-something million people he killed.
[00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:51.108]  Another 20 million since then.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.520]  David Icke's coming up.
[00:18:54.941 --> 00:18:57.102]  You know, usually it's hard to get David on.
[00:18:57.142 --> 00:18:57.802]  He's a busy guy.
[00:18:57.842 --> 00:18:58.562]  It takes like a month.
[00:18:58.742 --> 00:18:59.943]  But I sent a message last night.
[00:18:59.963 --> 00:19:00.884]  I said, look, it's an emergency.
[00:19:01.164 --> 00:19:01.584]  You need to come on.
[00:19:01.604 --> 00:19:03.365]  People need to hear from you after what you witnessed yesterday.
[00:19:04.005 --> 00:19:06.006]  So I said, just come on two segments.
[00:19:06.026 --> 00:19:07.167]  He said, no, I've got an hour for you.
[00:19:07.867 --> 00:19:08.928]  So he's coming up next segment.
[00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:11.869]  Then we've got Paul Joseph Watson, also from London.
[00:19:11.889 --> 00:19:15.551]  And then we've also got James O'Keefe.
[00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:17.372]  And you know, the James O'Keefe thing is so big.
[00:19:17.392 --> 00:19:19.273]  I'm going to hit that now.
[00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.955]  And then I'm going to get into the China thing that's everything.
[00:19:25.755 --> 00:19:27.017]  You need to go to InfoWars.com.
[00:19:27.037 --> 00:19:28.258]  It's in the first paragraph.
[00:19:28.278 --> 00:19:31.041]  There's a link to the article with all the documents, everything.
[00:19:31.062 --> 00:19:32.123]  You got to read this whole thing.
[00:19:32.904 --> 00:19:34.205]  It's only 30 something pages long.
[00:19:34.545 --> 00:19:34.806]  It's got...
[00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:36.491]  Yeah.
[00:20:08.312 --> 00:20:13.016]  I personally am going to call the FBI today here in Austin when I get off air.
[00:20:14.697 --> 00:20:23.603]  I'm just going to go over there and I'm going to hand them copies of this and say, I don't care if you're not the counter-espionage division, you've got a duty to do this.
[00:20:23.623 --> 00:20:24.564]  We all have a duty to do this.
[00:20:24.844 --> 00:20:29.147]  This is smoking gun and it brings down the whole house of cards.
[00:20:30.588 --> 00:20:32.630]  It describes in here how they hit Governor Abbott.
[00:20:34.235 --> 00:20:49.079]  I mean, how they hit Boris Johnson, how they hit all the conservatives that weren't for the lockdowns, and flooded them with millions of tweets and attacks from the Chinese government that Twitter, Facebook, and Google knew about, to then bully them into submission in lockdowns as well.
[00:20:49.879 --> 00:20:51.199]  And how the FBI knows about it.
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.580]  I mean, it's just incredible!
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.561]  And it's got links to the FBI knowing about it!
[00:20:56.581 --> 00:20:58.021]  I didn't even know the FBI knew about that!
[00:20:58.421 --> 00:21:00.562]  So, you know, you think you know all this stuff and you don't know about it.
[00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:04.338]  It's a big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:04.438 --> 00:21:06.039]  A big, big, big deal.
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:15.305]  So I'm gonna get to the Veritas thing where they caught Ilhan Omar's people red-handed just bragging and how they're harvesting the ballots, how they're doing all these scams.
[00:21:15.445 --> 00:21:17.706]  And I mean, this is what Ilhan Omar's name is crime.
[00:21:17.726 --> 00:21:20.108]  I mean, she comes from a crime syndicate family.
[00:21:21.148 --> 00:21:21.869]  She thinks it's funny.
[00:21:22.729 --> 00:21:23.690]  She's funded by Soros.
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:24.431]  That's all coming up.
[00:21:25.111 --> 00:21:28.093]  Briefly, there's a critical area to keep us on air.
[00:21:30.174 --> 00:21:32.097]  They have been trying to shut us down for a long time.
[00:21:32.137 --> 00:21:32.597]  You know that.
[00:21:32.697 --> 00:21:38.825]  And folks have really been coming through and buying a lot of products at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:38.845 --> 00:21:40.047]  These are already great products.
[00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:42.770]  And I think, I know Trump's going to win.
[00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:43.651]  They're going to contest it.
[00:21:43.691 --> 00:21:44.652]  Pelosi says she's going to.
[00:21:45.478 --> 00:21:48.320]  Hold it up to January 20th, and then it goes to the House of Representatives.
[00:21:48.601 --> 00:21:49.882]  They elect who they want as president.
[00:21:50.262 --> 00:21:51.683]  They're going to elect Pelosi.
[00:21:51.703 --> 00:21:52.084]  She said it.
[00:21:52.124 --> 00:21:53.185]  She said, I'm going to be the president.
[00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.946]  I played that club at the start of the show.
[00:21:55.186 --> 00:21:56.688]  Well, she's back again saying no.
[00:21:56.988 --> 00:21:58.949]  She's getting the House ready to line up the votes now.
[00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.511]  And it's just insane.
[00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:01.972]  That one story should be our top story.
[00:22:02.252 --> 00:22:04.354]  Instead, I've got dozens of huge things.
[00:22:04.374 --> 00:22:05.975]  I mean, this is the move to take us down.
[00:22:06.956 --> 00:22:09.779]  And it's so sad that more Americans are so politically and culturally
[00:22:11.064 --> 00:22:11.404]  Ignorant.
[00:22:11.444 --> 00:22:21.214]  They don't understand the existential threat we're all facing and how anyone against our republic and anybody not rooting for Trump is a crazy person for your own damn self-interest.
[00:22:21.254 --> 00:22:23.497]  I mean, this is so cut and dry.
[00:22:27.014 --> 00:22:31.619]  So all I can tell you is today is the last day of the special at preparewithalex.com.
[00:22:31.679 --> 00:22:32.920]  Preparewithalex.com.
[00:22:33.381 --> 00:22:36.564]  You can always get the full list of high-quality storable foods at m4restore.com.
[00:22:36.584 --> 00:22:37.265]  They're ready to ship.
[00:22:37.665 --> 00:22:40.168]  It comes to you within one to two weeks, depending on the type of food you get.
[00:22:40.228 --> 00:22:41.049]  They still have to package it.
[00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:41.690]  It's so fresh.
[00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.294]  Everybody else is pretty much sold out or has way higher prices or tells you they've got it ready to ship and they don't.
[00:22:46.354 --> 00:22:49.197]  We've got the best company with the highest quality for the price you're going to pay.
[00:22:50.165 --> 00:23:04.739]  PrepareWithAlex.com, that's PrepareWithAlex.com, and that is a special site my patron created so you can get lower deals than even I can offer or they can offer, specifically on certain high-quality, swearable food packages.
[00:23:06.107 --> 00:23:10.890]  High-quality, gravity-fed water filtration systems and, of course, air filtration systems.
[00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.631]  And it's those three specials.
[00:23:12.651 --> 00:23:16.474]  And I've asked them to come up with some more specials and have a new sale soon, but they're not even sure they can do that.
[00:23:16.754 --> 00:23:23.898]  So this is the last day of the sure thing to get the very best deal on the very best deal on high-quality, swirlable food at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[00:23:23.918 --> 00:23:27.681]  The full catalog, at the lowest prices you're going to find, is at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:32.724]  It's three items they've got at the even lower price at PrepareWithAlex.com, if you want all the other stuff.
[00:23:33.024 --> 00:23:36.006]  So I remember when I was a young man and I saw this man on the Terry Rogan Show.
[00:23:54.369 --> 00:24:07.047]  I did, at the time, he was a BBC presenter, a footballer, and I did think, wow, this man's a little strange in how he's coming on a TV show and saying such things.
[00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:10.091]  Many years later,
[00:24:11.474 --> 00:24:13.835]  This man is still saying the same thing.
[00:24:13.855 --> 00:24:20.657]  A lot of people who reach celebrity status sell themselves out.
[00:24:21.457 --> 00:24:24.318]  This man has maintained a stance.
[00:24:28.239 --> 00:24:33.681]  Let's give some respect to a man of truth, Mr. David Icke!
[00:24:41.836 --> 00:24:45.698]  Thank you.
[00:24:45.758 --> 00:24:48.180]  Thank you.
[00:24:50.481 --> 00:25:04.028]  Thank you.
[00:25:04.128 --> 00:25:10.672]  To think that people used to laugh at me in the street once,
[00:25:12.399 --> 00:25:17.040]  Speak your truth and the world comes to you.
[00:25:22.541 --> 00:25:25.222]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are watching history unfold.
[00:25:26.662 --> 00:25:41.025]  40, 50, 60,000, who knows, the police were trying to keep them from getting into that famous Trafalgar Square with Lord Nelson up there on top of that big beautiful tower, pillar, and there's David Icke.
[00:25:42.363 --> 00:25:43.243]  Predicting all of it.
[00:25:44.163 --> 00:25:45.764]  One of the few people that actually was able to do it.
[00:25:45.804 --> 00:25:46.824]  We were able to do it as well.
[00:25:48.044 --> 00:25:49.645]  And now it's all unfolding.
[00:25:50.325 --> 00:25:52.785]  And now things are happening very, very quickly.
[00:25:53.525 --> 00:25:59.047]  The world government, the tracking system, the Communist Chinese social score that we told you would be here eight months ago.
[00:25:59.347 --> 00:26:00.667]  We said they'd be rolling it out by the fall.
[00:26:00.807 --> 00:26:01.627]  It's now being rolled out.
[00:26:02.307 --> 00:26:05.048]  David Icke has graciously agreed to join us for the next hour.
[00:26:06.053 --> 00:26:15.020]  And it's just an incredible time to be alive and to be witnessing almost a million people marching in Germany repeatedly, hundreds of thousands overall marching all over England.
[00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:21.685]  And the police with billy clubs began, I guess, to close in while you were speaking and then arrested some of the speakers.
[00:26:22.446 --> 00:26:25.887]  Like scientists and professors and others, I guess they didn't get you.
[00:26:27.007 --> 00:26:30.509]  People didn't know what happened once they closed in and began billy clubbing people.
[00:26:31.109 --> 00:26:32.069]  This isn't becoming 1984.
[00:26:32.729 --> 00:26:34.150]  This isn't becoming the Soviet Union.
[00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.771]  This isn't becoming Nazi Germany.
[00:26:36.871 --> 00:26:37.331]  It's here.
[00:26:38.291 --> 00:27:02.995]  Then I look at everything happening in Australia and the UK, looking through keyholes, coming to do house inspections, the UN saying, well take your children out, people are escaping from secret facilities, and as you're vindicated that almost everyone died of something else, and they're just saying it's COVID, and as top hospital heads come out and say this, they're being arrested in Australia now.
[00:27:03.715 --> 00:27:06.036]  So this is a very, very, very, very dark time.
[00:27:07.031 --> 00:27:07.512]  In the world.
[00:27:25.993 --> 00:27:30.676]  They were giving $13,000 fines to people that were the speakers there a few weeks ago.
[00:27:30.716 --> 00:27:32.257]  They still came out despite the threat.
[00:27:32.837 --> 00:27:33.797]  Totally draconian.
[00:27:33.837 --> 00:27:35.999]  They let Black Lives Matter, they let the communists march.
[00:27:36.699 --> 00:27:37.680]  What did you witness there?
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.680]  What unfolded after?
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.881]  And then you've got the floor, my friend.
[00:27:41.462 --> 00:27:42.082]  Hello, Alex.
[00:27:42.402 --> 00:27:54.149]  Well, you see, the danger that has always terrified this global cult is the threat of a good example.
[00:27:55.126 --> 00:28:01.812]  You see this in countries where governments come to power and they want to do what's right by the people.
[00:28:02.253 --> 00:28:06.537]  You have a regime change system to get rid of them.
[00:28:06.557 --> 00:28:15.806]  And the threat of a good example here is 45,000 plus people assembling against the
[00:28:17.734 --> 00:28:26.260]  Social distance, unsocial distance rules, and to challenge those rules and everything that goes with it, the masks, all of it.
[00:28:27.381 --> 00:28:36.748]  And if that had been allowed to be completed without a problem, then there's a threat of a good example, because more and more people are going to come.
[00:28:37.609 --> 00:28:40.531]  More people are going to say, we want some of this, we're going to organise something.
[00:28:41.357 --> 00:28:54.608]  And so what happened is, well, from my personal point of view, it all comes down for me needing the toilet, funnily enough, because I was supposed to speak last in the series of speakers.
[00:28:55.209 --> 00:29:03.456]  And had I done so, I wouldn't have spoken because the police morons, not all the police are morons.
[00:29:03.476 --> 00:29:04.877]  There were some very nice police there.
[00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:12.244]  But then in came the brutal ones with the batons, which are a very different animal.
[00:29:13.545 --> 00:29:26.907]  And they would have stopped the event before I spoke, but because I needed the toilet, and I couldn't get out and get back in time with all the people there, you've got to go across to a railway station to go, they said, well, we'll go on now.
[00:29:26.947 --> 00:29:30.508]  And I went on two speakers early and finished the speech.
[00:29:31.368 --> 00:29:36.174]  And the next speaker came on, a doctor from Germany, and that's when it all kicked off.
[00:29:36.675 --> 00:29:42.942]  And from a personal point of view, as soon as I walked off the stage, I was heading for the toilet across the railway station.
[00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:48.629]  And some security people who were working at the event said, we'll come with you to help you get through everything.
[00:29:50.849 --> 00:30:00.513]  I walked out through the crowd from the speakers area and a lot of people came with me and they wanted to take pictures and say hello, which was lovely.
[00:30:00.553 --> 00:30:03.013]  So my focus was all on them around me.
[00:30:03.554 --> 00:30:10.116]  But I started to feel as we moved away towards the road, I got the vibes from the security people at the front.
[00:30:10.616 --> 00:30:11.717]  There's something going on here.
[00:30:13.835 --> 00:30:27.840]  I remember them shouting to everybody, just act normal, just walk normal, because they'd realised that the luminous jackets wearing face nappies, face diapers, were starting to gather.
[00:30:28.261 --> 00:30:32.262]  And as we got to the road, I saw some to my right and I saw some to my left.
[00:30:33.282 --> 00:30:40.025]  And what the security people did brilliantly is they headed straight for the gap between them because they hadn't come together by then.
[00:30:41.101 --> 00:30:43.984]  And so we got through the gap and out to the railway station.
[00:30:44.364 --> 00:30:49.468]  And when we got to the railway station, Charing Cross, the police were all coming from all directions as well.
[00:30:50.469 --> 00:31:02.079]  And then when I eventually got back to the car and people were looking at their mobile phones, we then realised what had unfolded back in the speakers area.
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.942]  And they targeted that because, of course,
[00:31:05.894 --> 00:31:13.442]  When you've got an event where people are talking to the crowd, you stop the speeches, you stop the event.
[00:31:13.763 --> 00:31:16.566]  The point is, though, that they'd waited.
[00:31:17.489 --> 00:31:20.491]  Until there was just two speakers left.
[00:31:20.931 --> 00:31:22.372]  I should have been the last one.
[00:31:23.793 --> 00:31:28.236]  And the reason was, it had gone magnificently.
[00:31:28.757 --> 00:31:30.378]  It was incredibly peaceful.
[00:31:30.438 --> 00:31:32.219]  It was very respectful to the police.
[00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:33.880]  We had a minute's silence right at the start.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.441]  No, you said nice things to the police.
[00:31:35.481 --> 00:31:36.942]  You said, wow, you're not being thugs.
[00:31:37.263 --> 00:31:38.904]  Good for you, because this is going to hurt you as well.
[00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.772]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:42.255 --> 00:31:49.829]  But it had to end like that, from the authorities' point of view, so that it could... Could not be a good example.
[00:31:50.802 --> 00:32:05.133]  Yeah, not to be a good example, and also, when you read the media coverage of a totally peaceful event, it's been portrayed as, in the Sun newspaper in Britain for instance, the thugs in the crowd attack the police.
[00:32:05.574 --> 00:32:09.617]  When what actually happened, and this is what we're dealing with Alex, it was quite a sight.
[00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:12.059]  I saw, they started grabbing people and beating them with billy clubs!
[00:32:12.699 --> 00:32:18.084]  Yeah, but what happened is that when these luminous jackets
[00:32:19.308 --> 00:32:21.550]  With people in them, animating them for the state.
[00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:28.916]  When they gathered together to do the charge, they were all standing there.
[00:32:29.036 --> 00:32:30.898]  It was described in two ways.
[00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:38.844]  One, like, you know the all-blacks rugby team when they do that big thing at the start, you know what I mean?
[00:32:39.044 --> 00:32:39.104]  Yes.
[00:32:39.464 --> 00:32:41.606]  That ritual before the start of a game.
[00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:46.370]  Well, they were doing it and they're banging their batons in unison.
[00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:55.776]  And someone else who watched that said they then screamed in unison, and they described it as like something out of Braveheart, the movie.
[00:32:56.177 --> 00:33:00.560]  And then they all started charging towards the speaker's area.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.083]  And you're right, they were hitting people with their batons.
[00:33:05.163 --> 00:33:09.025]  And then they say, oh, well, three policemen were injured.
[00:33:09.105 --> 00:33:10.026]  Police officers were injured.
[00:33:10.126 --> 00:33:14.091]  They're stampeding a crowd of people which could have caused a real stampede and killed a lot of people.
[00:33:14.111 --> 00:33:15.413]  They need to be arrested for attempted murder.
[00:33:15.433 --> 00:33:16.614]  We'll be right back with David Icke.
[00:33:17.075 --> 00:33:20.199]  Alright, I was talking to David Icke during the break and he was saying such powerful stuff.
[00:33:20.219 --> 00:33:20.699]  I said stop.
[00:33:21.727 --> 00:33:22.847]  Say that all again on air.
[00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:24.768]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:24.808 --> 00:33:28.209]  The websites are InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:35.092]  And remember, the system does all it can all day to block those sites, like Banned.Video, where David has a great sub-site with us.
[00:33:35.132 --> 00:33:38.573]  He's been banned on YouTube and other places, so now he gets millions of views at Banned.Video.
[00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:40.494]  There's other places he posts his material.
[00:33:41.214 --> 00:33:46.216]  I-C-K-O-N-I-C.com, Iconic.com, DavidIke.com.
[00:33:46.256 --> 00:33:47.637]  He's got a book out that just came out.
[00:33:47.717 --> 00:33:48.157]  I just read it.
[00:33:48.197 --> 00:33:48.597]  It's excellent.
[00:33:48.617 --> 00:33:50.338]  We'll tell you about that next hour.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.724]  We're now entering the beginning of the change of the tide, the turn of the tide.
[00:33:55.764 --> 00:33:56.585]  I totally agree with him.
[00:33:56.605 --> 00:33:57.886]  We're at that Zeitgeist moment.
[00:33:59.517 --> 00:34:02.039]  And to see the second big rally in London.
[00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:03.319]  They let the Communists rally.
[00:34:03.339 --> 00:34:04.340]  They let BLM rally.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.681]  They let all the other groups rally.
[00:34:06.121 --> 00:34:07.282]  Even groups that burn things down.
[00:34:07.302 --> 00:34:09.383]  But the peaceful group, they can't have a good example.
[00:34:09.863 --> 00:34:11.144]  Australia is totally locked down.
[00:34:11.184 --> 00:34:15.026]  There's articles of people escaping from quarantine that have been in there months.
[00:34:15.207 --> 00:34:19.349]  I mean, this is the total cover for them to come grab us out of our houses.
[00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:24.472]  So, David, you were saying during the break that you expect to be doing something very, very soon.
[00:34:24.512 --> 00:34:25.653]  Repeat that in your own words, please.
[00:34:27.195 --> 00:34:31.618]  I think the time's coming when me and the authorities look each other in the eye.
[00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:33.700]  No question about that.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:45.409]  Because what's happening in Britain, and let's not forget, Britain is one of the great centres, one of the premier centres of this global web.
[00:34:46.033 --> 00:35:02.245]  That's why little Britain has had so much power over the centuries, and although the British government doesn't anymore, globally, in theory, the centre of the web, which is different to the British government, the British government's just owned by the web, it's not the web itself,
[00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:09.006]  It's based in Britain for many, many historical reasons and other reasons.
[00:35:09.947 --> 00:35:16.708]  So we are a country where we're actually, you know, in the eye of the storm.
[00:35:16.828 --> 00:35:17.648]  So is America.
[00:35:17.668 --> 00:35:18.228]  So are others.
[00:35:18.308 --> 00:35:29.631]  But Britain is a place they really want to lock down big time and destroy and transform society from freedom to fascism.
[00:35:30.191 --> 00:35:30.471]  Thank you.
[00:35:47.714 --> 00:35:47.774]  I'm
[00:36:02.882 --> 00:36:14.548]  Eventually, if you go deep enough, you're hitting the military, which Johnson has just announced the military is going to now support the police, because what they want is a police military state, a fusion of the two.
[00:36:14.989 --> 00:36:26.335]  So as they increase, like mask wearing more and more and more people in more and more situations, and what they want, and they're not far from it now, is anyone who leaves their home has to wear a mask.
[00:36:27.175 --> 00:36:28.216]  Well, first of all,
[00:36:29.335 --> 00:36:30.195]  I haven't worn a mask.
[00:36:30.235 --> 00:36:31.316]  I'll never wear a mask.
[00:36:31.396 --> 00:36:32.856]  I don't do the social distancing.
[00:36:32.936 --> 00:36:35.077]  If people want to dart away from me, then fair enough.
[00:36:35.097 --> 00:36:35.697]  I'm not going to dart away.
[00:36:35.717 --> 00:36:40.778]  Well, that's right, and these big events prove it's a fraud, but we know it's really about contact tracing and apps on phone.
[00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:46.800]  The British government just announced you've got to have an app on your phone, and then the stores are enforcing it, where you've got to have this tracking app.
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.281]  So, boom, you're inside of it right there, then everything is connected to that.
[00:36:50.321 --> 00:36:51.281]  This is outrageous.
[00:36:52.188 --> 00:36:54.191]  Yeah, so I don't have a mobile phone.
[00:36:54.632 --> 00:36:56.314]  I don't have a smartphone that I use.
[00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:58.497]  So I don't have the app.
[00:36:58.958 --> 00:37:02.783]  I don't go to anywhere where I have to use it because I won't.
[00:37:03.644 --> 00:37:05.286]  I don't put toxic
[00:37:08.095 --> 00:37:13.439]  Toxins of shocking proportions on me hands called sanitizers.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:21.325]  75 brands said to be dangerous with possible loss of eyesight and even death by the Food and Drug Administration.
[00:37:21.365 --> 00:37:22.246]  I don't do any of that.
[00:37:22.706 --> 00:37:29.791]  So as the wolves come in, because what they're doing, Alex, here is where there's pushback,
[00:37:30.603 --> 00:37:32.705]  Then they're reacting to the pushback.
[00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:47.855]  So, for instance, the fines now for not wearing a mask, for not self-isolating when someone you passed briefly tests positive in a test, not even testing for the virus, the RT-PCR test.
[00:37:47.895 --> 00:37:54.018]  Sure, it's a fraud to let the left pick who they want to take away to quarantine and get us used to authorities coming and taking us away.
[00:37:54.319 --> 00:37:55.059]  They admit that.
[00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:56.680]  That's what the UN admits.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.702]  This is a giant leap forward for tyranny.
[00:37:59.742 --> 00:38:01.242]  This is a huge step.
[00:38:01.282 --> 00:38:02.423]  This is their big move, isn't it?
[00:38:03.404 --> 00:38:04.084]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:04.384 --> 00:38:07.106]  And what they're doing in this country now has just been announced.
[00:38:07.366 --> 00:38:10.307]  And by the way, this is not passing through Parliament having a debate.
[00:38:10.347 --> 00:38:11.268]  We've got no Parliament.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.404]  Parliamentary democracy in Britain is finished, gone.
[00:38:14.864 --> 00:38:16.026]  There is no opposition.
[00:38:16.426 --> 00:38:22.194]  There's just Johnson announcing on behalf of the dark suits who control him, this is what's going to happen next.
[00:38:22.615 --> 00:38:24.177]  And now they're changing the law.
[00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:30.800]  Let's talk about what the endgame is.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.903]  It isn't just the social credit score, the digital app tracking.
[00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:51.376]  They admit at the day most that the giant reset is to destroy all economies, kill the old people, consolidate control, starve the third world, which is already happening.
[00:38:51.416 --> 00:38:54.917]  So that's what I think we should do, is get in the face of the so-called left and explain.
[00:38:55.217 --> 00:39:01.919]  The UN itself that helped launch this goes, oh give us billions, tens of millions are starving to death, not from COVID but from the lockdown.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.781]  Well, just a topical thing you mentioned there in terms of Britain.
[00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:18.698]  Because what they did, and they've done this around the world, what they did in Britain is they moved people, old people, out of hospital and they put them in care homes.
[00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:26.445]  And then they would designate the care homes as being a COVID, you know, infected by COVID.
[00:39:26.485 --> 00:39:30.628]  Same thing in India, same thing in the EU, in Italy, same thing in the US.
[00:39:30.688 --> 00:39:32.610]  It's all directed by the spiders.
[00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:46.339]  And then what they would then do, as they've done everywhere, is once that care home is said to be infected with this virus, they claim, then all other treatments stopped.
[00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:49.000]  Antibiotics for other things, it all stopped.
[00:39:49.141 --> 00:39:59.848]  And tens of thousands of people in a relatively small country like Britain, old people, have died as a result of all this.
[00:40:00.008 --> 00:40:01.429]  Now, the topical thing is,
[00:40:02.409 --> 00:40:16.659]  There's now an article in a newspaper which is saying that they're actually planning to do exactly the same again and move old people out of hospitals into care homes because this is all part of the culling of the older population.
[00:40:17.219 --> 00:40:29.887]  We've talked about this going way back that this was the plan and they're using this as they are so many boxes they're ticking on their agenda as a result of current events and it's
[00:40:30.988 --> 00:40:51.025]  It's dawning on people, and I think, you know, a lot of the wake-up is it took a while for the penny to drop of the A, the scale of evil that we're dealing with, that has no empathy whatsoever, but also that how the world that they thought existed actually didn't exist at all.
[00:40:51.065 --> 00:40:51.846]  It was just a facade.
[00:40:52.706 --> 00:40:54.148]  For something else, exactly.
[00:40:54.508 --> 00:40:57.891]  But what's happening now, because it's got so extreme,
[00:40:58.698 --> 00:41:00.999]  Because it's been going on for so long.
[00:41:01.019 --> 00:41:05.042]  Well, you said on my broadcast 25 years ago, there will become a time of emergence.
[00:41:05.642 --> 00:41:12.666]  You said there will be a global awakening in 2016, they'll strike back in 2020, but humanity will win in the future after that.
[00:41:12.886 --> 00:41:16.909]  I know you were just streaming consciousness then, but you wrote articles saying that.
[00:41:16.949 --> 00:41:17.889]  You did predict it.
[00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:21.011]  I mean, that's even better than my predictions, buddy.
[00:41:22.132 --> 00:41:25.534]  Well, the thing is that I said a long time ago
[00:41:26.303 --> 00:41:32.829]  That this is going to have to get really bad before we can turn it around.
[00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:37.834]  Because we have to go a long way down the road to where they want to go.
[00:41:37.854 --> 00:41:41.498]  To the point where, my God, are we there now or what?
[00:41:41.918 --> 00:41:48.703]  Where what they've been doing under the radar, manipulating under the radar, breaks the surface where it can be seen.
[00:41:48.843 --> 00:41:50.704]  And it has to at some point, it had to.
[00:41:51.004 --> 00:41:57.488]  If you want to transform society, then at some point you break the surface and society is transformed.
[00:41:57.648 --> 00:42:06.214]  At that point, people who were in denial of this, what we were putting out, you know, this is what's coming.
[00:42:06.827 --> 00:42:07.267]  I don't know.
[00:42:26.261 --> 00:42:26.742]  People doing it!
[00:42:46.585 --> 00:42:50.947]  Is that if you think it's bad now, it's nowhere near it's meant to go.
[00:42:51.367 --> 00:42:53.227]  So when are we going to draw the line?
[00:42:53.247 --> 00:42:56.008]  That's right, your submission only makes it worse.
[00:42:56.028 --> 00:42:58.669]  Because they all trained to submit things are okay.
[00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:01.250]  No, now you submit, you're in a net, you're destroyed.
[00:43:02.771 --> 00:43:06.312]  Yeah, because look at how fascism comes in.
[00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:15.235]  Fascism doesn't come in because of the people in Trafalgar Square who are looking fascism in the face and calling it out.
[00:43:15.928 --> 00:43:24.854]  Fascism comes in because of all the members and massive swathes of the population that just obey authority.
[00:43:25.095 --> 00:43:26.456]  Look at Nazi Germany.
[00:43:27.056 --> 00:43:32.260]  A lot of people in Nazi Germany wouldn't have wanted Nazi Germany as it became.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:32.980]  David Icke, stay there.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.721]  We're going to start the last 30 minutes with you.
[00:43:34.821 --> 00:43:35.262]  Amazing.
[00:43:35.682 --> 00:43:36.463]  So glad you're here with us.
[00:43:36.483 --> 00:43:40.145]  We'll talk about what's coming up next, what you predict next, another rally.
[00:43:40.626 --> 00:43:41.927]  We have more rallies in America.
[00:43:42.267 --> 00:43:43.328]  We'll be right back with David Icke.
[00:43:43.348 --> 00:43:43.648]  Stay with us.
[00:43:45.461 --> 00:43:47.343]  So make no mistake, there is a global awakening.
[00:43:47.363 --> 00:43:48.563]  We're in the fight of our lives.
[00:43:50.205 --> 00:43:52.567]  David, I guess this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:43:53.347 --> 00:43:57.591]  David, I could ask a hundred questions and I've got a hundred questions, but just get back into your stream of consciousness.
[00:43:58.371 --> 00:44:05.237]  And then I've got a bunch of questions in the next segment about where this is going, what you think should unfold next, how you think the globalists are handling things.
[00:44:05.617 --> 00:44:07.438]  Looks to me like things aren't going the way they want.
[00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:11.862]  It looks like they're getting more pushback than they thought, but just what do you want to get back to right now?
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:24.235]  Well, like I was saying before the break, Alex, you know, where Nazi Germany ended up was not where I would suspect most Germans, members of the German public wanted it to go.
[00:44:24.836 --> 00:44:26.378]  But it was done incrementally.
[00:44:27.112 --> 00:44:36.318]  And they agreed to each new increment in what I call the totalitarian tiptoe to where it ended up.
[00:44:36.959 --> 00:44:47.986]  And it was in acquiescing to those early increments, which became more extreme increments, that transformed Germany into what it became.
[00:44:48.506 --> 00:44:55.871]  And what we're seeing now in country after country and globally is exactly that process.
[00:44:57.553 --> 00:45:00.838]  Three types of people allow fascism.
[00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:11.018]  One, the great majority that just do whatever they're told without question, because that's what they've been programmed all their life to do, just obey authority.
[00:45:11.038 --> 00:45:12.879]  It starts in the schools, obey the teacher.
[00:45:12.959 --> 00:45:19.583]  It's all manipulated all the way through your life to just obey authority by reflex action.
[00:45:20.163 --> 00:45:22.284]  Then there's the people that can see it's a problem.
[00:45:22.304 --> 00:45:23.405]  They can see it's a scam.
[00:45:23.425 --> 00:45:25.026]  They can see it's very dark.
[00:45:25.606 --> 00:45:30.929]  But they are in fear of the consequences of ceasing to acquiesce with it.
[00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:33.816]  And then you've got the third group, which is law enforcement.
[00:45:34.469 --> 00:45:38.650]  And law enforcement is manipulated.
[00:45:39.551 --> 00:45:48.594]  And indeed, in terms of the people we saw with the batons on Saturday, recruited specifically because they are psychopaths.
[00:45:48.754 --> 00:45:51.734]  That's how those riot police are put together.
[00:45:51.754 --> 00:45:59.737]  They recruit psychopaths and people who have no sense of moderation and balance.
[00:45:59.777 --> 00:46:02.498]  They just go in there and smack people.
[00:46:03.518 --> 00:46:12.344]  But the law enforcement in general, and there are some many, many good, decent people in law enforcement just trying to do their job.
[00:46:12.944 --> 00:46:26.653]  But once they allow themselves to become unquestioning agents and assets of the state, no matter what the state demands, then they become agents of fascism.
[00:46:26.673 --> 00:46:28.214]  That's how fascism comes in.
[00:46:29.134 --> 00:46:31.316]  And surely if they are there,
[00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:43.506]  to protect the people, then a fundamental part of that is to protect the people from government and to protect the people from tyranny.
[00:46:44.306 --> 00:46:52.032]  And I do urge law enforcement and the military to just think of this, you know,
[00:46:53.178 --> 00:47:00.629]  You've got children and grandchildren and they're going to have to live in the fascism that you're helping to enforce and to bring in.
[00:47:00.649 --> 00:47:06.116]  And when you leave the police, you are going to be subject to that as well.
[00:47:07.118 --> 00:47:08.540]  And there's no going back then.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:09.761]  It will be too extreme.
[00:47:10.462 --> 00:47:24.305]  So, these three groups of people, the yes sirs as I call them, the people who say I can see it but I don't do anything about it, and law enforcement, they're the three groups that allow fascism to come in.
[00:47:24.685 --> 00:47:33.187]  Then there's another group which we are all working so hard to make bigger and bigger and bigger and, you know, Saturday was fantastic.
[00:47:33.923 --> 00:47:35.864]  Are those that say, I can see it's a scam.
[00:47:36.004 --> 00:47:38.885]  I can see it's about destroying my freedom and my kids freedom.
[00:47:39.365 --> 00:47:40.125]  I'm not having it.
[00:47:40.545 --> 00:47:41.826]  No, I'm not doing your mask.
[00:47:41.846 --> 00:47:46.248]  No, I'm not doing your rules and regulations to take my freedom away.
[00:47:46.388 --> 00:47:47.048]  I'm not having it.
[00:47:47.188 --> 00:47:51.069]  I am not obeying and acquiescing with my own enslavement.
[00:47:51.409 --> 00:47:52.690]  And they are the people
[00:47:55.048 --> 00:47:56.410]  Who bring fascism to an end.
[00:47:56.510 --> 00:48:02.595]  Because if you think about it, Alex, the thing that breaks every single tyranny... Hold on.
[00:48:02.615 --> 00:48:03.416]  Tell us that when we come back.
[00:48:03.436 --> 00:48:04.256]  60-second break.
[00:48:04.296 --> 00:48:06.098]  The thing that breaks every single tyranny.
[00:48:06.458 --> 00:48:09.721]  David Icke is always on fire, but he is on fire, on fire, on fire.
[00:48:10.101 --> 00:48:11.523]  Tell everybody you know how to tune in right now.
[00:48:12.103 --> 00:48:14.105]  On your email, on your text message, word of mouth.
[00:48:14.245 --> 00:48:15.806]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:48:16.227 --> 00:48:16.887]  Band.video.
[00:48:16.907 --> 00:48:17.608]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:17.708 --> 00:48:18.408]  Send the link out.
[00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:20.250]  Tell folks at the local radio stations.
[00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:20.851]  Back in 60 seconds.
[00:48:23.129 --> 00:48:25.950]  I have no excitement meeting a top Hollywood star.
[00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.611]  Zero excitement meeting a member of the Senate.
[00:48:29.291 --> 00:48:32.633]  No excitement meeting some rock star.
[00:48:32.653 --> 00:48:33.373]  I could care less.
[00:48:33.393 --> 00:48:34.913]  But I get excited talking to David Icke.
[00:48:36.014 --> 00:48:37.795]  I get excited talking to you, the callers and listeners.
[00:48:38.335 --> 00:48:45.197]  I get excited talking to nurses that shoot video of how the people test non-positive but they put a tube down their lungs and kill them.
[00:48:45.918 --> 00:48:47.518]  And that woman's a hero exposing that.
[00:48:47.698 --> 00:48:52.120]  I get excited about the future and resisting tyranny and building a better world.
[00:48:53.635 --> 00:48:57.537]  It's always that tiny minority that first stands up and says no, and then others follow.
[00:48:58.158 --> 00:48:59.739]  But we are at such a critical time.
[00:48:59.779 --> 00:49:03.841]  David Knight does a great job weekday mornings.
[00:49:04.001 --> 00:49:05.722]  Owen Schroyer does an amazing job.
[00:49:07.303 --> 00:49:13.247]  With The War Room, we're doing weeknights 7 to 9 with Dionne Lorraine and other great hosts.
[00:49:13.707 --> 00:49:18.811]  The special transmission where we lay it all out with the election countdown.
[00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:20.170]  Yeah.
[00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:22.032]  What has broken every tyranny in history?
[00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:51.111]  It's self-respect.
[00:49:51.753 --> 00:49:52.496]  That's what does it.
[00:49:53.189 --> 00:49:54.190]  It's self-respect.
[00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:58.092]  Because self-respect says, I'm not having it.
[00:49:58.473 --> 00:50:06.998]  I'm not being told what to do by people who are simply telling me that I have to hand all my freedom to them.
[00:50:07.238 --> 00:50:08.059]  I'm not doing it.
[00:50:08.379 --> 00:50:14.583]  And what self-respect does is it invokes the power of no every time.
[00:50:14.603 --> 00:50:16.524]  Because self-respect says, what?
[00:50:16.925 --> 00:50:19.346]  Wear a face diaper?
[00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:20.907]  Are you having a laugh?
[00:50:21.268 --> 00:50:21.688]  No way.
[00:50:22.248 --> 00:50:23.129]  Put it on the kids?
[00:50:23.429 --> 00:50:23.969]  No way.
[00:50:24.369 --> 00:50:25.270]  Self-respect.
[00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:32.273]  And what they're doing is targeting human self-respect.
[00:50:33.154 --> 00:50:35.595]  And the mask is a big thing in that, you know.
[00:50:36.516 --> 00:50:39.177]  Because they are dehumanizing people.
[00:50:39.237 --> 00:50:40.858]  They are deleting individuals.
[00:50:40.938 --> 00:50:41.818]  It's an archetype.
[00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:42.439]  It's a burka.
[00:50:42.579 --> 00:50:43.359]  It's a muzzle.
[00:50:43.499 --> 00:50:44.920]  It's a sign of slavery.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.361]  It takes away your individuality.
[00:50:47.868 --> 00:50:49.689]  Exactly what it does is dehumanization.
[00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:51.691]  And you know, just a quick one.
[00:50:52.231 --> 00:51:05.060]  I did a hell of a lot of research years and years ago over many, many years about MKUltra and that massive government mind control, military mind control operation in the United States.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.981]  It's still going on under other names, of course.
[00:51:07.882 --> 00:51:21.577]  I was talking to someone that was held in captivity and all that, and her daughter was born in captivity in the MKUltra programme, and she said that her daughter was forced to wear a mask.
[00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:34.274]  From the age of two as part of her perceptual psychological... You interviewed that lady like 25 years ago and she said, I'm going back from the interview, didn't she say their plan is to have everybody wear a mask?
[00:51:34.614 --> 00:51:39.297]  There was even a big novel written like 70 years ago predicting a future where we all wear a mask.
[00:51:39.998 --> 00:51:45.221]  Yeah, and look at another, well, the ongoing MKUltra.
[00:51:46.542 --> 00:51:48.423]  Michael Jackson was a
[00:51:50.403 --> 00:51:54.766]  was in those programmes that followed MKUltra.
[00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:56.387]  And look at what he did.
[00:51:56.407 --> 00:51:57.587]  He had that period, do you remember?
[00:51:57.767 --> 00:51:58.968]  When he was always wearing a mask?
[00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:08.293]  It's a tremendous symbol of dehumanisation and de-individualisation.
[00:52:08.874 --> 00:52:10.895]  And also it divides people.
[00:52:11.515 --> 00:52:16.198]  And like I said in the speech in Trafalgar Square, this symbol
[00:52:17.018 --> 00:52:26.169]  Of the mask is something that we can use in a positive way too, because it is a blatant obvious symbol of our enslavement.
[00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:35.861]  So if you want to, if you want to express your freedom in the face of fascism, then take your bloody mask off.
[00:52:36.554 --> 00:52:37.434]  All over the world.
[00:52:37.494 --> 00:52:38.535]  Take your mask off.
[00:52:38.915 --> 00:52:40.155]  Even if you believe in the bloody virus.
[00:52:40.175 --> 00:52:43.916]  By the way, I've noticed the poorer the area of Austin I'm in, the more masks are worn.
[00:52:44.256 --> 00:52:45.797]  You go to rich areas, nobody's wearing a mask.
[00:52:45.817 --> 00:52:47.117]  You go to really poor areas, they're all wearing them.
[00:52:48.697 --> 00:52:53.499]  Yeah, but what self-respect says is I'm not wearing a mask.
[00:52:53.539 --> 00:52:54.559]  Don't be stupid.
[00:52:55.719 --> 00:52:57.180]  I'm not staying in me home.
[00:52:57.992 --> 00:53:00.853]  Because you say so, Mr. Dark Silver.
[00:53:01.353 --> 00:53:02.034]  Let's pull back.
[00:53:02.294 --> 00:53:04.194]  All the checkboxes they want to check off.
[00:53:04.555 --> 00:53:08.856]  Digital Society, locking people down, able to come and arrest people, disappear them if they want.
[00:53:09.376 --> 00:53:12.478]  Now in Canada, now in Australia, now in the U.S.
[00:53:12.538 --> 00:53:17.400]  in key areas where the globals are in control, they're now disappearing people that refuse to do a test.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.201]  They're coming to the doors of people in Houston, Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:53:21.121 --> 00:53:22.161]  Give me a blood test.
[00:53:22.541 --> 00:53:23.382]  They're intimidating.
[00:53:23.422 --> 00:53:26.303]  I mean, clearly they want the cover to start arresting people.
[00:53:26.643 --> 00:53:27.923]  What's really behind this?
[00:53:27.983 --> 00:53:29.343]  Not just shutting off economies.
[00:53:30.064 --> 00:53:30.944]  Where are they going with this?
[00:53:30.964 --> 00:53:32.404]  Because they say they're never going to end it.
[00:53:32.424 --> 00:53:35.505]  I mean, once they get you in a trap, they're habituating this forever.
[00:53:37.026 --> 00:53:39.286]  Oh, this is the whole point, Alex.
[00:53:39.306 --> 00:53:44.328]  This is the whole point that I'm working every day to get across to people.
[00:53:44.908 --> 00:53:47.729]  But hey, don't think this is going to end.
[00:53:48.698 --> 00:53:53.722]  Unless we end it by non-acquiescence on a mass scale, it's not going to end.
[00:53:54.082 --> 00:53:55.123]  It's a process.
[00:53:56.103 --> 00:53:57.524]  Where we are is where we are.
[00:53:57.584 --> 00:53:58.945]  It's not where it's meant to end.
[00:53:59.285 --> 00:54:12.735]  Where it's meant to end is the total and utter subjugation of humanity, where AI is connected to the human brain to become the human mind, where the human mind as we've known it is basically deleted.
[00:54:13.455 --> 00:54:28.871]  And where everything 24-7 is totally controlled under total surveillance and in the end even the human form as we know it is being transitioned into something else.
[00:54:29.031 --> 00:54:29.852]  Let's talk about that.
[00:54:30.452 --> 00:54:33.556]  You pioneered exposing this but every ancient culture recognized it.
[00:54:34.216 --> 00:54:38.658]  The Bible says there's an alien force brewing on the planet that wants to destroy us, take us over, use us.
[00:54:39.339 --> 00:54:41.820]  I mean, clearly now, that's not even debated now.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:46.622]  All the big globalists, Elon Musk, all of them say, oh no, we're in a hologram controlled by entities.
[00:54:47.022 --> 00:54:49.403]  I mean, I don't know anybody that really says they're an atheist anymore.
[00:54:49.664 --> 00:54:51.024]  They all understand this is part of something bigger.
[00:54:51.044 --> 00:54:55.586]  But why are they obsessed with taking us out of our natural environment and turning us into robots?
[00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:58.528]  Are they threatened by the individual consciousness?
[00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:01.270]  Well, yes they are.
[00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:02.652]  Absolutely they're threatened.
[00:55:02.812 --> 00:55:18.069]  And more than threatened by individual consciousness, they're threatened totally and utterly by expanded levels of consciousness that take us, in our perceptions and our insights and our awareness, out of their bubble, their frequency bubble, which they've actually put us in.
[00:55:18.089 --> 00:55:18.229]  Exactly.
[00:55:18.249 --> 00:55:21.773]  First we have to be individuals, but then we can expand to higher levels and then we actually become a collective.
[00:55:22.537 --> 00:55:33.300]  Yeah, but you know, from where I'm coming from, we're all points of attention in one infinite flow of consciousness, which some people call God, call it what you like.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.560]  It's an infinite flow of consciousness and we're all an expression of it.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.301]  But we're an individual, unique expression of it.
[00:55:40.621 --> 00:55:43.042]  So the connection
[00:55:44.091 --> 00:55:51.274]  We are all each other, and the individuality is absolutely not incompatible.
[00:55:51.954 --> 00:55:53.674]  They're just expressions of the same thing.
[00:55:53.714 --> 00:56:06.859]  And their system seeks to manipulate the fact that we are communal to go into a false communal kind of prison it's built that isn't even us, where we then accept their frequency and enslave ourselves as something that's a counterfeit?
[00:56:07.898 --> 00:56:13.660]  Yeah, what they're doing is they're creating this smart grid, and Musk is right at the centre of it.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:19.262]  That guy should be in jail with a key for a mid-Atlantic, along with Gates and all the others.
[00:56:19.603 --> 00:56:23.084]  What they're doing is they're creating this smart grid, which is what?
[00:56:23.644 --> 00:56:25.445]  It's a frequency grid.
[00:56:25.786 --> 00:56:28.928]  It's a frequency grid generated technologically.
[00:56:28.968 --> 00:56:33.671]  That's why they're putting all the satellites up, putting 5G, beaming 5G at the Earth.
[00:56:33.972 --> 00:56:37.995]  They're creating what I've been calling since the 1990s, one called the smart grid then.
[00:56:38.375 --> 00:56:40.516]  I called it the technological sub-reality.
[00:56:41.397 --> 00:56:42.818]  And then they want to attach
[00:56:42.898 --> 00:56:43.499]  Thank you.
[00:56:57.435 --> 00:57:03.296]  technologically disconnected from expanded levels of consciousness.
[00:57:03.416 --> 00:57:11.478]  And we just basically live our lives in a bubble in which we won't be human in the sense that we perceive human.
[00:57:12.058 --> 00:57:13.239]  So that's what they want.
[00:57:13.319 --> 00:57:17.099]  And to go back to your question, why do they want to?
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.720]  Why do they want to make us cyborgs?
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.101]  Well, here's something, because that's what they are.
[00:57:25.003 --> 00:57:29.387]  They are assimilating humanity into themselves.
[00:57:29.727 --> 00:57:37.493]  We are talking about an artificial intelligence that's actually behind this, or what we call artificial intelligence.
[00:57:37.553 --> 00:57:38.734]  It's much deeper than that.
[00:57:39.234 --> 00:57:41.616]  Is that why they come off so inauthentic?
[00:57:41.636 --> 00:57:42.677]  You can instantly see them?
[00:57:43.298 --> 00:57:43.998]  They don't look real?
[00:57:44.018 --> 00:57:44.759]  There's something off?
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.761]  Well, this is the point, Alex.
[00:57:50.083 --> 00:57:53.446]  If I did something on this computer,
[00:57:55.218 --> 00:57:58.179]  Would the computer say, oh, hold on a minute.
[00:57:58.399 --> 00:57:59.619]  That's a bit extreme, innit?
[00:58:00.059 --> 00:58:01.759]  What about the effects of people of that?
[00:58:01.819 --> 00:58:02.719]  Where's your empathy?
[00:58:02.759 --> 00:58:04.060]  The computer ain't gonna do that.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.960]  Just processing the information.
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.040]  And that's what these people are.
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:09.220]  This is what Gates is.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.401]  This is what all these people are.
[00:58:10.421 --> 00:58:10.861]  Stay there.
[00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:11.941]  Final segment, David Icke.
[00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:12.681]  Amazing.
[00:58:12.961 --> 00:58:13.581]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:14.001]  Stay with us.
[00:58:15.382 --> 00:58:23.423]  Alright, we really appreciate David Icke joining us on short notice after that incredible Saturday rally that was attacked by paramilitary thugs.
[00:58:25.307 --> 00:58:27.029]  Classical tyranny is here upon us.
[00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:32.054]  He was getting into how these psychopaths, these sociopaths operate like robots.
[00:58:32.996 --> 00:58:36.279]  Finishing up with that, then I just want to get into what you predict comes next.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.261]  We saw with the Brexit.
[00:58:39.155 --> 00:58:40.115]  I just want to finish that other point.
[00:59:03.953 --> 00:59:05.995]  I refer to these people as psychopaths.
[00:59:06.616 --> 00:59:07.798]  And what is a psychopath?
[00:59:07.818 --> 00:59:13.146]  A psychopath has no empathy, has no remorse, has no compassion.
[00:59:14.207 --> 00:59:15.389]  And what am I describing?
[00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:17.272]  I'm describing a computer!
[00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:22.671]  A computer has no empathy, it has no compassion, it has no remorse, it just processes information.
[00:59:23.011 --> 00:59:24.292]  This is what these people are.
[00:59:24.652 --> 00:59:32.774]  And when I look at Bill Gates, I see no human energy, I see no human life, I see no human sparkle in his eyes.
[00:59:33.234 --> 00:59:34.155]  I see a cyborg.
[00:59:34.395 --> 00:59:45.898]  And what I would say, like an AI, but what I would say, it's very important to emphasize, is when I use terms like, you know, they're a form of AI and that they're a form of
[00:59:47.639 --> 00:59:51.122]  Of non-human kind of technology.
[00:59:51.943 --> 00:59:55.026]  I'm not talking about technology that we know about.
[00:59:55.046 --> 00:59:57.828]  I'm not talking about AI that we know about.
[00:59:57.928 --> 00:59:59.370]  It's far, far more.
[00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:05.015]  It's obviously an interdimensional imprint, a transmission that they're dialed into.
[01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:08.598]  As you state, they're genetically resonating with it.
[01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:10.620]  Yeah, but this is the point.
[01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:20.132]  Because they are not consciousness in the way that humans are consciousness.
[01:00:21.093 --> 01:00:31.597]  They can't get out there to the great beyond of inspired insight and knowing and awareness, etc.
[01:00:32.117 --> 01:00:35.479]  They have to manipulate us, who can,
[01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.627]  To build our own prison.
[01:00:38.788 --> 01:00:39.788]  By the way, here's an example.
[01:00:39.909 --> 01:00:40.529]  Here's an example.
[01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:49.657]  A bunch of top scientists, David, came to Bill Gates and others and said, phones, smartphones will be the future.
[01:00:50.117 --> 01:00:52.199]  And Gates didn't believe it and blocked it.
[01:00:52.479 --> 01:00:57.524]  And it shows like some of these top guys are like super stupid, I'm told, when you really actually talk to them.
[01:00:57.764 --> 01:00:59.525]  And people say they're like robots.
[01:00:59.966 --> 01:01:02.128]  They do the same thing every day in the same order.
[01:01:02.568 --> 01:01:03.509]  Is that what you're talking about?
[01:01:04.298 --> 01:01:05.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:10.049]  They're not free-flowing consciousness.
[01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:14.959]  They are a very, very, my God, beyond anything we can imagine in the human world now.
[01:01:15.866 --> 01:01:19.210]  A very, very advanced form of AI.
[01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:23.274]  This is why they have no compassion and they have no empathy and why they're psychopaths.
[01:01:23.314 --> 01:01:29.040]  And this is why they have no emotional consequence for anything they do.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:33.505]  Therefore, there's no fail safe mechanism of human behavior, which is empathy.
[01:01:33.525 --> 01:01:34.646]  They don't have that.
[01:01:34.966 --> 01:01:36.068]  So you look at Gates.
[01:01:36.768 --> 01:01:37.509]  He, as
[01:01:38.817 --> 01:01:50.833]  He's been majorly involved in orchestrating the last few months of this fake pandemic, which has created death, destruction and human catastrophe all over the world.
[01:01:51.353 --> 01:01:56.180]  He wants to use that to vaccinate every man, woman and child with
[01:01:57.683 --> 01:02:02.989]  Well, that's what I was going with next.
[01:02:03.009 --> 01:02:10.918]  We have the mRNA that isn't a regular vaccine goes in and reprograms the body and they admit makes you GMO and they admit makes almost everybody sick.
[01:02:10.998 --> 01:02:12.160]  What the hell's going on there?
[01:02:13.035 --> 01:02:28.021]  Well, the idea of the Gates vaccine, part of it is a sterilisation kind of operation because they want the end of humans, say human 1.0, what we have now.
[01:02:28.241 --> 01:02:29.042]  They want an end to that.
[01:02:29.322 --> 01:02:31.743]  So they don't want procreation of that because they want to end it.
[01:02:32.143 --> 01:02:41.706]  They want to go to humans 2.0, which is an expression of this big emerging scientific discipline now, called synthetic biology.
[01:02:42.046 --> 01:02:43.567]  That's what these people are.
[01:02:43.587 --> 01:02:44.827]  They're synthetic biology.
[01:02:44.847 --> 01:02:49.368]  Because to these people, I've been writing about this for decades... And by the way, that's not your opinion.
[01:02:49.408 --> 01:02:55.650]  Just like all the GMO companies make a seed that grows a plant that doesn't make new seeds, that's not even really what the plant was.
[01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:57.931]  So nothing can continue to regenerate.
[01:02:57.971 --> 01:02:59.332]  It's got to come out of a corporate system.
[01:02:59.572 --> 01:03:00.292]  They want to play God.
[01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:07.895]  Yeah, biology to these people is a form of technology, and they manipulate it on the basis of that.
[01:03:08.676 --> 01:03:22.024]  And so what you are looking at with this vaccine, this is why they want it in every man, woman and child on the planet, are nanobots, self-replicating nanobots to change the nature of the human body.
[01:03:22.405 --> 01:03:30.570]  And in the end, procreation will be done technologically, in a laboratory if you like, just as older sucks are described in Brave New World.
[01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:31.390]  That's 5%.
[01:03:53.181 --> 01:03:53.901]  Absolutely.
[01:03:54.261 --> 01:04:06.424]  And on the other side, there's these self-replicating nanobots, which are in something like a kind of a gel, which is well talked about by people who've been on the inside.
[01:04:06.444 --> 01:04:10.545]  And that's to transform the body.
[01:04:10.765 --> 01:04:15.226]  I remember you interviewed people 20-something years ago that said they would put gel on them that would go into their body.
[01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:24.965]  Yeah, well this is what people from the inside, people who've worked inside FEMA and others... But now it's out in the open!
[01:04:26.038 --> 01:04:27.580]  Yeah, it's coming.
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:46.979]  Yeah, because you can read scientific papers on it about the properties, but you look at the vaccine, you look at the DNA manipulating nature of the actual way the vaccine is inserted into the cell and you put all this together and what I'm describing is becoming now, you know, in your
[01:04:48.496 --> 01:04:54.642]  And as they move us more and more to this synthetic biological human, what are they doing?
[01:04:54.742 --> 01:04:57.064]  They're moving us closer and closer to what they are.
[01:04:57.685 --> 01:05:01.088]  Biological... Exactly, exactly.
[01:05:01.249 --> 01:05:02.250]  They are ending humanity.
[01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:04.832]  They are terraforming us into their planet.
[01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:09.137]  Yeah, it's... I've been calling it for decades, the assimilation.
[01:05:09.737 --> 01:05:11.339]  Now, we don't have to do that.
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.484]  Because we have to be manipulated into building our own prison.
[01:05:16.584 --> 01:05:17.345]  Let's just stop there.
[01:05:17.405 --> 01:05:19.127]  We're literally not hypothetical now.
[01:05:19.627 --> 01:05:21.409]  We are now being openly assimilated.
[01:05:21.689 --> 01:05:24.612]  The Wall Street Journal, NBC says, the end of humanity.
[01:05:24.852 --> 01:05:26.233]  We're going to make you be a cyborg.
[01:05:26.293 --> 01:05:26.934]  It's for the earth.
[01:05:27.194 --> 01:05:27.855]  Carbon's bad.
[01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:29.136]  They're saying what we are is bad.
[01:05:29.516 --> 01:05:30.217]  Total fraud.
[01:05:30.257 --> 01:05:31.038]  This is so heavy.
[01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:34.861]  So now it's gone from total denial below the surface to out in the open.
[01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:37.684]  This is going to be one incredible time to be alive, David.
[01:05:38.513 --> 01:05:48.383]  Yeah, because what happens is, you see, when you are manipulating below the surface, under the radar, you can say, this is a load of rubbish, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:05:48.823 --> 01:05:58.153]  But when it comes and we're there, where it has to break the surface and become part of life that people could see, you go from hiding it to selling it.
[01:05:58.533 --> 01:05:58.833]  Yes.
[01:06:14.707 --> 01:06:15.888]  By the way, David, you agree.
[01:06:15.908 --> 01:06:17.689]  I only wanted you for 30 because I know you're busy.
[01:06:17.729 --> 01:06:18.570]  You ended up doing an hour.
[01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:19.730]  Do a three-minute break.
[01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:20.131]  Come back.
[01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:21.892]  Talk about the books, round at a time.
[01:06:22.392 --> 01:06:26.695]  And then tell us when you think the next demonstration's coming and what you expect's going to happen there.
[01:06:26.715 --> 01:06:33.519]  Because I'm going to call for a demonstration at the Texas Capitol, just in solidarity with what you're doing, what Germany's doing, what Japan's doing, what Australia's doing.
[01:06:33.839 --> 01:06:34.840]  We've got to do it this Saturday.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.061]  We need big numbers out there.
[01:06:36.481 --> 01:06:37.982]  So David Icke's very gracious.
[01:06:38.002 --> 01:06:38.762]  DavidIcke.com.
[01:06:38.782 --> 01:06:40.864]  Find this book, The Answer, at DavidIcke.com.
[01:06:40.904 --> 01:06:42.105]  Come back and put bookends on this.
[01:06:43.376 --> 01:06:43.996]  Welcome back!
[01:06:44.077 --> 01:06:45.297]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:45.998 --> 01:06:47.339]  David Icke is our guest.
[01:06:47.639 --> 01:06:48.600]  He leaves us in a few minutes.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.582]  Then, Paul Joseph Watson's coming on.
[01:06:52.562 --> 01:06:57.586]  James O'Keefe of Project Veritas got total proof of election fraud with Ilhan Omar in Minnesota.
[01:06:57.626 --> 01:06:58.427]  It's all coming up.
[01:06:59.507 --> 01:07:00.948]  But David, get into your new book.
[01:07:00.988 --> 01:07:01.489]  It's excellent.
[01:07:01.509 --> 01:07:01.989]  I've read it.
[01:07:02.009 --> 01:07:02.750]  The answer.
[01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:04.511]  My wife's read it.
[01:07:04.971 --> 01:07:08.994]  This Saturday, we were in the backyard playing with my three-year-old daughter.
[01:07:09.694 --> 01:07:11.356]  And my older kids were off doing things with their friends.
[01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:25.108]  We, uh, was, uh, kind of in the morning, and we, we, we watched her speech after it had been live, and then we saw the articles about the attacks, and my wife saw the Billy Club attacks and all that, and couldn't find out what happened, and she was there at night still, trying to find out what happened, really, really upset.
[01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:28.973]  See, that's a normal human behavior, because she understands they're coming for her.
[01:07:29.574 --> 01:07:30.575]  They're coming for our daughter.
[01:07:30.795 --> 01:07:31.695]  They're coming for us.
[01:07:31.796 --> 01:07:37.920]  And the empathy these psychos don't have is a group defense for all of us that we see something happening to somebody else.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.701]  We understand that can happen to us.
[01:07:40.161 --> 01:07:42.403]  But these psychos wear it as a badge of honor.
[01:07:42.423 --> 01:07:45.385]  And these sociopaths, they don't have that.
[01:07:45.965 --> 01:07:51.831]  I know a lot of that's genetic, but now they're proving that more young people are either becoming more empathetic or less empathetic.
[01:07:52.332 --> 01:07:53.913]  And it's very, very, very, very dangerous.
[01:07:54.294 --> 01:08:03.283]  But still the psychos and sociopaths are able to manipulate some of the empathic people, some of the empathetic people, with false systems.
[01:08:03.323 --> 01:08:05.105]  That's a whole other discussion.
[01:08:05.445 --> 01:08:07.707]  How do those of us that have empathy not be manipulated?
[01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:20.676]  By the system, but with things accelerating as fast as they are, tell us about the book and closing comments about the moment and the history that we're coming into, because there'll be no more time for denial now.
[01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:22.738]  Folks are going to be forced to choose a side.
[01:08:24.079 --> 01:08:29.042]  Well, in terms of the manipulation of empathy, I would phrase I've been using for a long time.
[01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:34.145]  There's nothing more manipulatable than genuineness that isn't streetwise.
[01:08:35.373 --> 01:08:56.298]  And we have to have streetwise empathy and realising when our emotions are being manipulated and our natural empathy is being used against us, where we are brought into empathy so that we act and behave in ways that suit the agenda.
[01:08:57.478 --> 01:09:12.403]  So, for instance, we've had, and I'm sure it will happen again, we had through the summer months and the spring, people on the streets of Britain every week clapping the National
[01:09:12.483 --> 01:09:14.945]  Stay in your house, meanwhile it's all a fraud and they're killing the third world.
[01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:31.116]  Yeah.
[01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:32.937]  So you've got to be streetwise.
[01:09:32.957 --> 01:09:34.477]  To get streetwise, you've got to get informed.
[01:09:34.497 --> 01:09:42.980]  And to get informed, you've got to stop getting your information, thus your perceptions, thus your behavior, from the mainstream media, which is owned by the people that are manipulating you.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.401]  And part of being streetwise is admitting when you've been chumped.
[01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:48.042]  When I've been scammed, I admit it, I warn others.
[01:09:48.682 --> 01:09:52.724]  What I notice with amateurs, people that never grow, is they never want to admit when they've been conned.
[01:09:53.724 --> 01:09:55.024]  Well, this is the point, you know.
[01:09:55.184 --> 01:09:57.225]  We're dealing with people.
[01:09:57.785 --> 01:09:58.646]  They may be sick.
[01:09:58.766 --> 01:09:59.706]  They may be evil.
[01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:08.451]  And in the greater expansion of consciousness, they may actually not be very bright, but what they're brilliant at is manipulating perception.
[01:10:09.131 --> 01:10:12.033]  And that means scamming people's perception.
[01:10:12.633 --> 01:10:18.816]  And, you know, instead of saying, oh, I don't want to admit I've been deceived, oh God, I feel such an idiot.
[01:10:19.671 --> 01:10:21.752]  Instead, be empowered by it.
[01:10:21.772 --> 01:10:23.652]  Hey, fantastic!
[01:10:23.913 --> 01:10:26.914]  Because now I'm aware I'm not going to be scammed anymore.
[01:10:27.074 --> 01:10:28.314]  My life is moved on.
[01:10:28.854 --> 01:10:44.180]  And we have to move, Alex, I would suggest, from the great number of people now worldwide who are starting to see it, not least through their own experience, to not just seeing it but crossing the road
[01:10:45.405 --> 01:10:48.407]  And not even fighting it, but ceasing to engage with it.
[01:10:48.707 --> 01:10:49.988]  Ceasing to obey it.
[01:10:50.448 --> 01:10:51.208]  Seeking to cooperate.
[01:10:51.248 --> 01:10:52.829]  That's what my wife and I do now.
[01:10:52.969 --> 01:10:54.070]  And Owen Schroer does it.
[01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:55.971]  We just ignore them in stores and restaurants.
[01:10:55.991 --> 01:10:57.632]  They tell us, put masks on, do it.
[01:10:57.652 --> 01:10:58.172]  We just ignore them.
[01:10:58.192 --> 01:10:58.953]  They usually just go away.
[01:11:00.213 --> 01:11:00.414]  Yeah.
[01:11:00.954 --> 01:11:02.495]  And that's what I do.
[01:11:02.795 --> 01:11:06.377]  I mean, if they want to fine me for not wearing a mask, well, they can do that.
[01:11:06.657 --> 01:11:07.578]  But I'm not paying it.
[01:11:08.518 --> 01:11:11.320]  And that's why, you know, I'm going to look him in the eye eventually.
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.421]  And I think it's very important, Alex, you know,
[01:11:13.997 --> 01:11:21.741]  That those people in the alternative media that say this is what people should do actually do it themselves.
[01:11:22.222 --> 01:11:25.544]  You know, we should not just say, oh, this is the way.
[01:11:25.584 --> 01:11:28.805]  We should show the way by not doing it.
[01:11:28.905 --> 01:11:33.748]  So I won't do any of the things that when I say to people, you know, just don't acquiesce with this.
[01:11:33.888 --> 01:11:34.208]  I'm not.
[01:11:34.328 --> 01:11:35.309]  I'm not acquiescing.
[01:11:35.969 --> 01:11:36.450]  And I won't.
[01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:37.730]  I absolutely won't.
[01:11:38.391 --> 01:11:48.436]  And, you know, when I see people in the alternative media who say, oh, this is terrible, that's terrible, and then they go into a shop in a mask on, I mean, you know, where are we going with this?
[01:11:49.116 --> 01:11:50.337]  What are you doing?
[01:11:50.957 --> 01:11:59.341]  You know, and the more people that come behind us in this, the power of no.
[01:12:00.242 --> 01:12:00.842]  Here's the problem.
[01:12:00.862 --> 01:12:01.683]  I was about to bring this up.
[01:12:03.023 --> 01:12:03.864]  If we don't
[01:12:06.135 --> 01:12:06.715]  Say no.
[01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.997]  The new thing is getting beat up by people on the street.
[01:12:10.158 --> 01:12:16.582]  I was out at the Greenbelt flying this Saturday, the drone, with a speaker warning people.
[01:12:16.622 --> 01:12:20.444]  And most people were shaking their hand, but we had women saying, F you, we're heroes.
[01:12:20.464 --> 01:12:21.645]  A guy threatened to kick our ass.
[01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:22.826]  And
[01:12:24.719 --> 01:12:32.063]  Once they're trained, as David said, with successful approximation to make you wear a mask, then it's make you have an inoculation, take you out of your house, which they now admit's the plan.
[01:12:32.363 --> 01:12:33.424]  I mean, we know their plan.
[01:12:33.684 --> 01:12:38.887]  Now we have the documents that are on Infowars.com where the Chinese government with the UN orchestrated all of this.
[01:12:40.488 --> 01:12:50.494]  So really what David Icke's saying is the answer is finding your power and saying no to the system and not going along with it because this is very, very, very serious time to be alive.
[01:12:50.914 --> 01:12:52.595]  I appreciate David Icke giving us so much time.
[01:12:53.933 --> 01:12:54.933]  This book is the answer.
[01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:56.814]  And I've read it.
[01:12:56.874 --> 01:12:57.434]  It's excellent.
[01:12:57.694 --> 01:12:58.414]  My wife's read it.
[01:12:58.654 --> 01:13:00.534]  And David knows what he's talking about.
[01:13:01.154 --> 01:13:08.156]  And when you finally come to grips with this is an alien force called wherever it came from, whatever it is, whatever it, I mean, it wants to destroy us.
[01:13:08.796 --> 01:13:09.956]  It wants to get rid of our humanity.
[01:13:09.996 --> 01:13:14.857]  And Bill Gates has this mRNA vaccine that they admit makes everybody sick.
[01:13:14.897 --> 01:13:19.618]  That changes your DNA that goes into your cell and reprograms you.
[01:13:21.756 --> 01:13:24.038]  And really, this is the chickens coming home to roost.
[01:13:24.138 --> 01:13:24.478]  Okay.
[01:13:25.959 --> 01:13:27.220]  Tell David, thank you so much.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.761]  That was as good a place to end it as any.
[01:13:28.781 --> 01:13:29.622]  He did a great job.
[01:13:30.502 --> 01:13:33.104]  If you do get him back on, if not, email him and tell him thank you very much.
[01:13:34.485 --> 01:13:37.227]  Really admire everybody that went out to that demonstration in England.
[01:13:37.887 --> 01:13:39.849]  800 plus thousand that showed up repeatedly.
[01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:43.631]  Multiple demonstrations were almost a million each in Berlin.
[01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:45.713]  The Germans have been under tyranny, they get it.
[01:13:46.574 --> 01:13:48.095]  And this is total
[01:13:49.414 --> 01:13:50.495]  Tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:50.735 --> 01:13:51.996]  Absolute abject evil.
[01:13:52.016 --> 01:13:55.259]  You can see David's full 20-minute speech at Banned.video.
[01:13:55.579 --> 01:13:56.820]  It's being pulled down off YouTube.
[01:13:57.181 --> 01:14:05.768]  Because again, YouTube says they followed the UN, and that's run by the Chinese government, that you're not allowed to criticize lockdowns.
[01:14:06.488 --> 01:14:08.991]  Remember early on, all the different Facebook groups in the U.S.
[01:14:09.051 --> 01:14:10.872]  organizing lockdown protests were being banned?
[01:14:13.314 --> 01:14:15.256]  Just think about how crazy that is.
[01:14:16.197 --> 01:14:17.618]  We cannot fail, David Icke.
[01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:24.531]  And his September 26th speech, that's what it's titled, Band-Odd Video.
[01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:25.792]  And listen, I know listeners.
[01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:27.953]  I know I'm like a parrot up here.
[01:14:28.073 --> 01:14:29.954]  Share the link, share the link, share the links.
[01:14:31.615 --> 01:14:32.936]  You know what's going on.
[01:14:33.076 --> 01:14:37.939]  So you have a reverse osmosis thing where you kind of just think everybody else knows because you know.
[01:14:38.019 --> 01:14:38.659]  No, they don't know.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.022]  But they're ready to hear the truth now.
[01:14:45.603 --> 01:14:47.484]  And they're ready to understand what's going on now.
[01:14:48.988 --> 01:14:49.228]  I think so.
[01:15:10.959 --> 01:15:12.000]  We don't make money off that.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:14.361]  There's not advertisements from third parties on the site.
[01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:20.125]  I just think about minds we're reaching, people we're getting to, and how great it is.
[01:15:20.165 --> 01:15:23.507]  Now we take the money that comes in from your purchases of the products.
[01:15:24.067 --> 01:15:24.527]  David's back.
[01:15:24.908 --> 01:15:25.708]  We've got 44 seconds.
[01:15:26.108 --> 01:15:27.509]  David, sorry, your Skype cut out.
[01:15:27.549 --> 01:15:28.090]  We love you.
[01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:29.410]  Closing comment, my friend.
[01:15:30.711 --> 01:15:36.555]  Yeah, just saying, you know, this is the time for Backbone.
[01:15:37.674 --> 01:15:42.759]  And not compromising with tyranny, because that's how we got into this mess.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:46.843]  And as I was saying, I don't exactly know what we've cut out.
[01:15:47.203 --> 01:15:54.151]  But if your bottom line is I'm not doing A, B or C, you'll find a way
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:20.980]  to live your life without doing it even though initially you might say well I've got to do it because but when you say I'm not doing it end of story then you you live your life in a way that will wake up the games are over now everything's gonna move very very quick Alex Jones back live here James O'Keefe coming up Project Veritas with all his incredible information and Paul Joseph Watson as well they've been actually very gracious after
[01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:27.128]  Being on the island there and then going back to his home, another island off the coast of England, and his Skype broke down.
[01:16:27.168 --> 01:16:29.008]  We had about five minutes getting him back, but he's here.
[01:16:29.028 --> 01:16:37.853]  David, you were hitting that critical point when you cut out about critical mass, and I think people finally get, before complying, the system would move on.
[01:16:37.953 --> 01:16:43.155]  Now complying means you're going to have to give your humanity up and literally starve to death.
[01:16:43.175 --> 01:16:45.537]  I mean, people now get, wow, this is really authoritarian.
[01:16:46.097 --> 01:16:48.638]  History's repeating itself, and there is a big wake up.
[01:16:49.078 --> 01:16:50.019]  So please continue.
[01:16:51.604 --> 01:17:13.013]  Well, one of the reasons history is repeating itself, Alex, is because the same cult that's behind the pandemic hoax and all these other aspects of the global agenda were the same force behind Nazi Germany, the same force behind the Mao revolution in China, the same force behind the Stalin era in Russia.
[01:17:13.873 --> 01:17:26.263]  So this is the game plan, and what they're doing now is simply using the techniques of tyranny that they've used in countries and areas of the world, and they're going global.
[01:17:27.544 --> 01:17:28.505]  This is what's happening.
[01:17:28.545 --> 01:17:38.793]  So the techniques are familiar to anyone who's lived in a totalitarian state, except now the world is supposed to become a totalitarian state.
[01:17:40.093 --> 01:17:49.156]  But, you know, a few can't control the many without the compromising of self-respect by the many.
[01:17:49.796 --> 01:17:52.017]  And I keep coming back to self-respect.
[01:17:52.377 --> 01:18:02.080]  And what I was saying earlier, I don't know what's got across and what hasn't in terms of the dropout of Skype, but you can either look at a situation
[01:18:03.101 --> 01:18:12.205]  And you can say, well, I have to do this, which I don't want to do, and I know it's part of the agenda, because of circumstances.
[01:18:12.986 --> 01:18:13.646]  Now, that's a way.
[01:18:14.506 --> 01:18:17.148]  And what you'll do is you'll say, well, I don't want to do it, but I've got to do it.
[01:18:18.288 --> 01:18:21.970]  Or you can say, I ain't doing it.
[01:18:22.710 --> 01:18:23.471]  I'm not doing it.
[01:18:23.611 --> 01:18:25.732]  Like I've said, I'm not doing any of this stuff.
[01:18:27.012 --> 01:18:32.575]  And what happens then is your life forms in a different way.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.982]  Where there's a will, there's a way.
[01:18:35.522 --> 01:18:37.324]  And you find a way around it.
[01:18:37.364 --> 01:18:44.771]  You find a way of doing something that you thought you would have to do because of your circumstances.
[01:18:44.791 --> 01:18:49.936]  And have you not found those the most exhilarating, most delicious points in history, in your life?
[01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:55.121]  And you change your circumstances and suddenly you realize, well actually,
[01:18:56.039 --> 01:18:57.580]  I don't have to do that, do I?
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:06.103]  Like, you don't have to send your kids to school to wear masks all day and fundamentally damage their health, which they're going to call COVID-19.
[01:19:06.824 --> 01:19:10.766]  You can actually, if you say no, that's out of the game.
[01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.246]  That's out of the debate.
[01:19:12.526 --> 01:19:13.727]  That's not happening.
[01:19:14.067 --> 01:19:18.029]  You find a way of... So you're saying it's time to draw the line in the sand.
[01:19:18.089 --> 01:19:19.569]  Things only get worse submitting.
[01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:20.690]  Time to draw the line.
[01:19:22.037 --> 01:19:26.401]  I mean, people, how bad does it have to get before that line is drawn?
[01:19:26.842 --> 01:19:28.903]  You know, and it's only going to get worse and worse.
[01:19:29.144 --> 01:19:47.501]  Well, David, imagine this, and briefly say where you see it going, because I know you're dead on, but just imagine if I had you on 10 years ago and you said they'll have a fake virus, they'll lock down, we're all wearing masks for eight, nine months, they say it's unlimited, Bill Gates has a vaccine that goes in and changes your whole body and makes you GMO and makes everybody sick, they admit, and it's going to be in the Associated Press that
[01:19:48.141 --> 01:19:51.143]  Uh, their polio shot is the number one cause of polio.
[01:19:51.504 --> 01:19:55.006]  I mean, now they've gone to the point, as you said, of just up front going like a cigarette pack.
[01:19:55.287 --> 01:19:56.428]  By the way, this is going to kill you.
[01:19:56.868 --> 01:19:58.409]  They're not even going to try to deny it anymore.
[01:19:58.429 --> 01:19:59.650]  That's even more scary.
[01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:01.091]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:20:02.132 --> 01:20:07.116]  Yeah, well, because they've reached the point where they can't credibly deny it, because they've broken the surface.
[01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:07.816]  They've entered the room.
[01:20:07.856 --> 01:20:08.537]  They've entered the ring.
[01:20:09.754 --> 01:20:18.101]  And that's a very dangerous time for them, because people who could just deny this stuff, oh that's conspiracy crap, all that stuff, they can't now because it's in their face.
[01:20:18.942 --> 01:20:26.648]  And we've got to reach this point where people in large, large numbers just have the courage
[01:20:27.691 --> 01:20:33.035]  To cross the street and don't just see it, but cease to cooperate.
[01:20:33.075 --> 01:20:34.676]  No, I agree, but let me just say this in closing.
[01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:41.722]  I get you call it courage, and that's what it is for trailblazers like yourself and others, but this is self-preservation.
[01:20:42.523 --> 01:20:47.887]  You gotta have courage, dumb courage, to sit here and be a slave and be sterilized and basically slow killed.
[01:20:48.247 --> 01:20:50.769]  To me, it's self-preservation to say, damn it, I don't have a chance.
[01:20:50.809 --> 01:20:51.349]  I'm cornered.
[01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:51.890]  I'm gonna fight.
[01:20:53.047 --> 01:20:54.970]  It's exactly, exactly what it is.
[01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:59.658]  And, you know, courage is overcoming fear.
[01:21:00.612 --> 01:21:03.774]  If you don't have fear, you don't need courage.
[01:21:04.015 --> 01:21:09.639]  See, I don't feel courageous at taking the system on so publicly.
[01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:10.620]  I don't feel courageous.
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.501]  My self-respect ain't having it.
[01:21:12.521 --> 01:21:13.902]  I don't need courage.
[01:21:13.962 --> 01:21:15.743]  My self-respect is saying I'm not doing it.
[01:21:16.024 --> 01:21:18.806]  You are not going to impose your will on me in that way.
[01:21:19.286 --> 01:21:20.847]  Therefore, I'm not having it.
[01:21:21.287 --> 01:21:22.749]  And what happens, happens.
[01:21:22.789 --> 01:21:23.729]  But that's my line.
[01:21:23.889 --> 01:21:24.610]  I'm not having it.
[01:21:25.851 --> 01:21:27.192]  And, you know, imagine
[01:21:28.201 --> 01:21:31.457]  You saw the morons come in.
[01:21:32.476 --> 01:21:33.857]  Um, with their batons.
[01:21:34.218 --> 01:21:36.740]  And there were 45,000 people there, right?
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.261]  But they didn't take on the 45,000.
[01:21:38.381 --> 01:21:40.463]  Oh no, because they couldn't.
[01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:43.866]  They took on a small group in the Speaker's area.
[01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:46.548]  Now imagine there's a quarter of a million there on Saturday.
[01:21:46.908 --> 01:21:56.976]  And let's just say it, there comes a time, and I'm glad I'm not saying it's now, that that 45,000 could have torn those men limb from limb and then stormed the government buildings and would have won.
[01:21:57.537 --> 01:22:01.080]  So they know we have the power, that's why they picked a small group to exercise their power.
[01:22:02.099 --> 01:22:05.781]  Yeah, but so they don't want to take on the 45,000.
[01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:09.604]  They'll take on a small area to stop the event, which is where the speakers were.
[01:22:10.244 --> 01:22:13.406]  But, you know, we don't need violence.
[01:22:13.426 --> 01:22:14.307]  We don't need any of this stuff.
[01:22:14.327 --> 01:22:16.348]  We just need not to cooperate.
[01:22:16.408 --> 01:22:16.768]  I agree.
[01:22:16.828 --> 01:22:19.190]  Don't you agree that this is going to trigger an even bigger event?
[01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:20.190]  That's the closing question.
[01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:23.052]  Bigger event.
[01:22:23.212 --> 01:22:24.473]  I see 500,000, not 40,000.
[01:22:24.513 --> 01:22:27.135]  I think the next event is going to be earth shattering.
[01:22:27.964 --> 01:22:29.684]  Well, that's where we need to go.
[01:22:30.625 --> 01:22:48.168]  And the more the extremes come in, and of course, what's happening now is these so-called furlough payments, where they bought people's acquiescence through this period up to now, when they've been laid off or not been able to work, they're coming to an end in countries all around the world, not least in Britain.
[01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:51.729]  And so people are going to be in great financial straits.
[01:22:52.529 --> 01:22:55.229]  And that's going to concentrate their minds.
[01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:57.370]  And they're the numbers we need.
[01:22:58.402 --> 01:23:03.527]  When you're dealing in hundreds of thousands of people and millions of people, the game's over.
[01:23:04.388 --> 01:23:07.130]  And that, the numbers are there.
[01:23:07.471 --> 01:23:09.813]  The numbers are there in people that can see it.
[01:23:10.814 --> 01:23:12.455]  Now we need the numbers there in people.
[01:23:12.515 --> 01:23:14.918]  Now all of us have to not just talk, we've got to walk the walk.
[01:23:14.978 --> 01:23:20.423]  In closing, do you agree with me that this is not going like Bill Gates and his controllers want it?
[01:23:20.483 --> 01:23:21.424]  It's not going well for them?
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:36.957]  No, it's not because of the information that we've been able to get out, even despite all the censorship, which makes far more sense of people's actual personal experience than what they're being told by government.
[01:23:37.477 --> 01:23:41.162]  And, you know, I would say that, you know,
[01:23:42.555 --> 01:23:48.298]  The people from the cult that will be watching this, you know, look me in the eye, right?
[01:23:48.658 --> 01:23:50.339]  You think you've won.
[01:23:50.839 --> 01:23:54.801]  You think you are just heading for the finish line.
[01:23:55.982 --> 01:23:56.722]  You ain't.
[01:23:57.182 --> 01:23:58.463]  This is only just begun.
[01:23:58.983 --> 01:24:11.750]  And when humanity not just speaks, but roars, and that it will do with the numbers, then you'll see that just as you thought you were there,
[01:24:12.529 --> 01:24:13.770]  It was snatched from you.
[01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:19.153]  Well, David Icke, watching you in that great crowd and watching what's happening in Germany is very, very satisfying.
[01:24:19.433 --> 01:24:20.414]  I'm very honored to know you.
[01:24:20.434 --> 01:24:22.675]  DavidIcke.com, the new book, The Answer, people should get it.
[01:24:23.055 --> 01:24:28.158]  I'm very, very honored to have you, very, very honored for the work of all the people out there, and it's great to be with you in solidarity.
[01:24:28.298 --> 01:24:28.758]  Thank you, sir.
[01:24:32.341 --> 01:24:36.283]  And that was a perfect time for his Skype to freeze up right as I said bye-bye to him.
[01:24:36.303 --> 01:24:38.044]  Let's put that still shot of David Icke up there.
[01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:39.285]  That was perfect.
[01:24:39.305 --> 01:24:40.045]  Tell David, thank you.
[01:24:40.065 --> 01:24:40.665]  Knocked it out of the park.
[01:24:42.293 --> 01:24:46.957]  Speaking of funding, the Globalists want to make you under their control.
[01:24:47.297 --> 01:24:53.283]  This is the last day to get the best deals on storable food, water filtration, air filtration at preparewithalex.com.
[01:24:54.143 --> 01:24:56.766]  The way it works with MyPatriot is we have their full catalog.
[01:24:56.786 --> 01:24:57.666]  They're in our back end.
[01:24:57.987 --> 01:25:02.871]  Get the best deals at themforestore.com on the big food bundles, the small food bundles, all of it.
[01:25:03.885 --> 01:25:13.332]  But on three items, a three-month food supply, and their highest quality water filtration system, their air filtration system, you get $170 off, $100, $140 off.
[01:25:14.553 --> 01:25:16.574]  That deal was extended for a week.
[01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:19.316]  It's got to end today because they're getting low on the particular filter.
[01:25:19.336 --> 01:25:24.740]  I'm going to try to get them to do a big food bundle special soon, so if you're holding out for that, wait for that.
[01:25:25.701 --> 01:25:30.705]  But if you want to get that three-month supply or the water filter right now, it is preparewithalex.com.
[01:25:31.285 --> 01:25:32.046]  And then separately,
[01:25:33.564 --> 01:25:34.386]  Grab the folder here.
[01:25:34.847 --> 01:25:44.287]  We've got the same InfoWars special and look, I don't get up here and tell you that InfoWars is in peril if it's not true, and I'm not at liberty to get into it.
[01:25:47.588 --> 01:25:48.669]  The whole damn country's in peril.
[01:25:48.689 --> 01:25:50.211]  People say, oh man, how are you doing?
[01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:53.735]  Let me tell you folks, behind the scenes, this country's burning down right now.
[01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:55.677]  And I don't want to demoralize you.
[01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:57.740]  The enemy's doing this because we're waking up.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:58.821]  They want to punish us.
[01:25:58.861 --> 01:26:02.905]  They want to make us turn against our common sense, turn against God, turn against our country, our families.
[01:26:05.248 --> 01:26:20.741]  Yeah, no, we need as much money as we can get in here because there's a very, very good chance that if Biden is able to steal his way into the election, I'm not saying it's a good chance he's going to win, I'm saying if he does, it's confirmed they've got a plan to turn everybody's bank accounts off that was pro-Trump.
[01:26:20.761 --> 01:26:22.723]  I mean, they're talking about millions of people.
[01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:26.266]  And we've already had this happen, so we know their plans.
[01:26:26.366 --> 01:26:33.132]  I'm trying to sell everything we've got right now to have funds in reserve to stay on air during the key big battles to come for the next six months.
[01:26:33.812 --> 01:26:35.457]  Everybody talks about 35 days to election.
[01:26:35.799 --> 01:26:37.825]  It's 113 to inauguration.
[01:26:38.146 --> 01:26:39.149]  That's the finish line.
[01:26:39.169 --> 01:26:39.611]  113 days.
[01:26:42.585 --> 01:26:45.967]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[01:26:45.987 --> 01:26:47.147]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:26:47.167 --> 01:26:48.728]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[01:26:48.748 --> 01:26:50.269]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[01:26:50.369 --> 01:26:51.390]  I want them shut down.
[01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:52.370]  I want them silenced.
[01:26:52.410 --> 01:26:53.211]  I want them muted.
[01:26:53.251 --> 01:26:55.032]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:26:55.072 --> 01:26:55.992]  You kept us on air.
[01:26:56.132 --> 01:26:57.433]  We did the analysis first.
[01:26:57.693 --> 01:26:58.694]  It's now gone mainstream.
[01:26:58.754 --> 01:27:00.575]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[01:27:00.855 --> 01:27:06.798]  And what they've said directly to us is, you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[01:27:06.958 --> 01:27:08.399]  And you need to stop right now.
[01:27:08.499 --> 01:27:09.560]  And they're very, very serious.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.261]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:13.241]  It's not going to happen.
[01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:14.921]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[01:27:15.362 --> 01:27:16.482]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[01:27:16.942 --> 01:27:17.842]  Rescue InfoWars.
[01:27:17.922 --> 01:27:18.562]  Save yourself.
[01:27:18.922 --> 01:27:19.562]  Save the world.
[01:27:19.862 --> 01:27:20.742]  We're in this together.
[01:27:20.842 --> 01:27:22.483]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:23.483]  Communism's up here.
[01:27:23.683 --> 01:27:26.623]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[01:27:27.024 --> 01:27:28.864]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[01:27:29.064 --> 01:27:30.604]  My children are right here!
[01:27:31.324 --> 01:27:33.105]  But I need money to fight a war!
[01:27:33.265 --> 01:27:34.325]  And I need word of mouth!
[01:27:34.545 --> 01:27:35.445]  And I need prayer!
[01:27:35.585 --> 01:27:36.545]  And I need action!
[01:27:36.925 --> 01:27:38.525]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[01:27:39.226 --> 01:27:41.186]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:45.124]  Well, you talk about a star-studded transmission.
[01:27:46.684 --> 01:27:56.526]  David Icke, Paul Joseph Watson, the head of Project Veritas James O'Keefe, all right here, floating around in the InfoWars ocean.
[01:27:58.187 --> 01:27:58.787]  Turn it up for a minute.
[01:28:03.808 --> 01:28:04.248]  That's right.
[01:28:05.776 --> 01:28:06.877]  I'm ready to pay the price.
[01:28:07.377 --> 01:28:12.140]  I didn't listen to advice, because I have my policy of truth, which I love so much.
[01:28:15.182 --> 01:28:18.144]  You know, I used to lie all the time about little petty stuff, nothing serious.
[01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:25.328]  Not business, not important things, but you know, lie to the girlfriend, lie to the wife about how they look or how dinner is.
[01:28:25.728 --> 01:28:26.509]  She'll get a problem.
[01:28:30.291 --> 01:28:31.632]  But instead, just get it all out in the open.
[01:28:33.613 --> 01:28:34.794]  And they can tell you what's wrong with you.
[01:28:35.913 --> 01:28:38.214]  We need to get a thicker skin, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:38.734 --> 01:28:40.695]  That's the answer to civilization and society.
[01:28:41.456 --> 01:28:43.577]  And not get pissed at somebody that's being truthful with us.
[01:28:43.977 --> 01:28:45.658]  Get pissed at people that are lying to us.
[01:28:45.678 --> 01:28:46.558]  That's who you got to worry about.
[01:28:47.819 --> 01:28:50.620]  But this whole liberal system is, oh, whatever you want to hear.
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:53.381]  Oh, it's all good as long as you submit to them.
[01:28:54.001 --> 01:28:57.743]  But there's lies in all of it and they don't deliver anything.
[01:28:59.024 --> 01:29:03.386]  You end up alone and empty and destroyed following the left-hand path.
[01:29:06.269 --> 01:29:09.310]  Okay, Paul Joseph Watts is coming up, and James O'Keefe.
[01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:20.692]  And I've got so much news to cover here, and I started the broadcast with Nancy Pelosi and the Chi-Coms, and we'll cover it all with Paul in a moment, but I thought we should probably just air this.
[01:29:20.732 --> 01:29:25.993]  I should have started the show with this, because Ilhan Omar is in a lot of trouble.
[01:29:26.033 --> 01:29:33.074]  These are people now confirmed to be part of our campaign, driving around bragging about how they're stealing the election.
[01:29:34.113 --> 01:29:46.259]  And how they're getting their absentee ballot harvesting from all the old people, paying them to vote the way they want, obviously pimping them, threatening them, and then also getting the other mail-in ballots to run their scams.
[01:29:46.619 --> 01:29:47.460]  So here's just part of it.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.501]  The full Project Veritas report is at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:50.881 --> 01:29:55.684]  Big Tech hopes you don't share it because, you know, they said there's no such thing as election fraud, but here it is in action.
[01:29:56.892 --> 01:30:00.673]  James O'Keefe here in downtown Minneapolis at the scene of the crime.
[01:30:00.693 --> 01:30:04.353]  The person you're about to meet, Liban Mohamed, a.k.a.
[01:30:04.754 --> 01:30:09.774]  King Liban 1, boasts about the hundreds of absentee ballots in his car.
[01:30:10.275 --> 01:30:11.215]  Numbers don't lie.
[01:30:11.295 --> 01:30:12.135]  Numbers don't lie.
[01:30:12.235 --> 01:30:13.875]  I got all of them.
[01:30:14.115 --> 01:30:15.996]  I'm going to steal the election.
[01:30:16.036 --> 01:30:16.616]  My car is full.
[01:30:23.762 --> 01:30:28.006]  Look at these, huh?
[01:30:28.066 --> 01:30:29.207]  Look.
[01:30:29.467 --> 01:30:29.907]  300 a day.
[01:30:30.347 --> 01:30:31.148]  There was video.
[01:30:31.248 --> 01:30:32.109]  You could see the video.
[01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:36.632]  There was a video out and about that he has the ballots in his car.
[01:30:36.652 --> 01:30:36.752]  Right.
[01:30:37.013 --> 01:30:40.836]  And talking about the only way you can win is with money.
[01:30:41.056 --> 01:30:42.457]  I was looking at them and they were not filled.
[01:30:42.477 --> 01:30:43.778]  They were blank.
[01:30:43.998 --> 01:30:46.280]  Who is the one filling out the absentee ballots?
[01:30:47.201 --> 01:30:50.683]  People who work, like in Panama Bar.
[01:30:51.524 --> 01:30:52.505]  Where do they pay the money?
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:57.142]  The minute we sign the thing, the election, that's what you get paid.
[01:30:57.322 --> 01:30:58.323]  Money is everything.
[01:30:58.903 --> 01:31:00.424]  Money is the key in this world.
[01:31:00.864 --> 01:31:02.325]  If you ain't got money, you're a shrimp.
[01:31:02.785 --> 01:31:08.889]  You should not be here, period.
[01:31:09.209 --> 01:31:11.490]  We have the ballot.
[01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:13.592]  We get the money from all people.
[01:31:13.632 --> 01:31:13.892]  Yes.
[01:31:14.172 --> 01:31:15.773]  There's three towers called one tower.
[01:31:15.893 --> 01:31:16.233]  Okay.
[01:31:16.493 --> 01:31:19.055]  And it's all seniors, and they took every ballot.
[01:31:19.275 --> 01:31:19.835]  Every ballot.
[01:31:19.875 --> 01:31:20.816]  They just take them from them.
[01:31:20.836 --> 01:31:21.296]  Every single ballot.
[01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:23.697]  Who is the one filling out the absentee ballots?
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:57.044]  By the way, Ilhan Omar comes from a major slave family that ran slavery in Somalia.
[01:31:57.084 --> 01:31:58.265]  She's a royal slave master.
[01:32:20.703 --> 01:32:22.607]  Starting tomorrow night, 5 p.m.
[01:32:22.647 --> 01:32:32.166]  Central, we're going to have commercial-free, right into 10-11 at night, coverage of the debate with myself.
[01:32:33.223 --> 01:32:36.945]  Deanna Lorraine, Owen Schroer, Robert Barnes, and so many others.
[01:32:37.025 --> 01:32:43.668]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London, England, the site of another huge rally against the lockdown.
[01:32:44.008 --> 01:32:52.371]  People looking through keyholes, police coming to houses for random inspections, apps rolling out, you gotta have to go to restaurants or live your life.
[01:32:52.772 --> 01:33:02.276]  We predicted it all, but also a big article he wrote, research shows deliberate Chinese propaganda campaign forced world into lockdown to dominate their economic foes.
[01:33:03.646 --> 01:33:12.391]  The full paper is at tabletmag.com, China's global lockdown propaganda campaign, with a bunch of computer researchers under a lawyer.
[01:33:13.071 --> 01:33:15.152]  They've done a great job showing how this works.
[01:33:15.393 --> 01:33:16.913]  It's absolutely huge.
[01:33:17.354 --> 01:33:19.195]  Paul Joseph Watson, thanks for joining us.
[01:33:20.395 --> 01:33:21.256]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:33:22.116 --> 01:33:30.141]  What do you want to tackle first, the COVID lockdowns or the fact that China, working with the UN, have used it as an economic tool of domination?
[01:33:32.307 --> 01:33:47.255]  I would lay the foundation, Alex, by citing a survey, which again has received basically no mainstream media attention, despite the fact that it's been out now for a good couple of months, and we're basically the only outlet to report on this from a media perspective.
[01:33:48.035 --> 01:33:55.038]  The headline was, Survey, Americans think coronavirus has killed 30 million people in the US, 220 times, 225 times higher than the actual figure.
[01:33:58.792 --> 01:34:03.854]  And this is not just Joe Biden, Alex, coming out with his verbal slip-ups.
[01:34:04.395 --> 01:34:10.037]  This is the effect of mainstream media hysteria over the past six, seven months.
[01:34:10.537 --> 01:34:17.300]  We now have a situation where the average American, and whenever I start this study, people are like, oh, where's the study?
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.341]  It's linked in the article.
[01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:18.881]  It's right there.
[01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:20.562]  The average American,
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:26.624]  thinks that coronavirus has killed 9% of the US population.
[01:34:27.064 --> 01:34:29.826]  That's 30 million people.
[01:34:30.346 --> 01:34:30.646]  Okay?
[01:34:30.927 --> 01:34:43.115]  It's actually killed 205,000, but then when you take into account the CDC's own announcement that only 6% of those deaths were solely due to COVID, obviously that's far less.
[01:34:43.775 --> 01:34:45.396]  But that just gives you a benchmark.
[01:34:45.416 --> 01:34:46.477]  That's how you can mirror.
[01:34:46.797 --> 01:34:47.798]  That's how you can measure.
[01:34:48.863 --> 01:34:54.706]  Just how terrified the population has been by this mainstream media hysteria, by this moral panic.
[01:34:55.347 --> 01:35:00.129]  Similar figures in Sweden, similar figures in the UK, similar figures all across the world.
[01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:10.775]  Generally people think that 6-7% of their population has died from coronavirus, when we actually know it's, you know, depending on the country, 0.2% maybe.
[01:35:11.756 --> 01:35:15.338]  So the people have been completely terrified, not just by the news media,
[01:35:16.252 --> 01:35:25.560]  But also by the entertainment media, by this whole virtue signaling crusade of you must wear a mask, you're a terrible person if you don't wear a mask.
[01:35:26.021 --> 01:35:30.565]  And then Alex, it's also on the entertainment shows, it's on the light entertainment shows.
[01:35:31.205 --> 01:35:32.727]  So in the UK, for example,
[01:35:33.749 --> 01:35:36.390]  You have the main BBC news at six o'clock.
[01:35:36.450 --> 01:35:42.373]  You have the local news, which of course is a constant drumbeat of paranoia and hysteria about coronavirus.
[01:35:42.933 --> 01:35:55.759]  Then you have light entertainment shows after, and for the past six months the main feature package of these light entertainment shows has been how anxious and terrified the general public is.
[01:35:56.279 --> 01:35:59.501]  So in one example they had a couple of young people
[01:36:00.476 --> 01:36:14.503]  Under the age of 25 as part of this feature on this light entertainment show and it showed you them going out into the public going out into the streets and literally having panic attacks because they saw a group of more than two people.
[01:36:14.623 --> 01:36:18.445]  So they're creating hysterical neurotics to go around and be the secret police?
[01:36:19.065 --> 01:36:22.808]  Who are under this total and complete mind control.
[01:36:22.828 --> 01:36:30.233]  And for people that are in areas like South Carolina or Georgia or, you know, rural areas of Texas, you're thinking, oh, that won't come here.
[01:36:30.573 --> 01:36:31.533]  Why do I care about England?
[01:36:31.894 --> 01:36:32.994]  What is in Australia?
[01:36:33.455 --> 01:36:34.635]  What is in Quebec City?
[01:36:35.016 --> 01:36:35.996]  What is in New York?
[01:36:36.297 --> 01:36:37.057]  What is in London?
[01:36:37.137 --> 01:36:38.418]  It's all coming here.
[01:36:38.458 --> 01:36:42.841]  This is globally run by the U.N., by the Chai Khans, by big corporations.
[01:36:43.181 --> 01:36:44.242]  This is their endgame.
[01:36:44.542 --> 01:36:47.605]  Total takeover, shutting you down, you're in a prison.
[01:36:47.866 --> 01:36:48.606]  They admit it.
[01:36:48.666 --> 01:36:50.208]  I mean, Paul, this is out in the open now.
[01:36:50.428 --> 01:36:51.409]  They've really made their move.
[01:36:53.231 --> 01:36:54.993]  Yeah, and it's completely coordinated.
[01:36:55.514 --> 01:37:03.482]  World Health Organization, World Bank, which by the way says this isn't going to end until 2025 when they've forced as many people to get the vaccine.
[01:37:03.902 --> 01:37:04.583]  And that's the point.
[01:37:04.843 --> 01:37:07.106]  If you accept the premise of the government being
[01:37:07.862 --> 01:37:13.285]  Uh, able to force you to wear a face mask, despite the fact that 97% of particles get through them.
[01:37:13.325 --> 01:37:14.365]  They're completely pointless.
[01:37:14.666 --> 01:37:15.766]  It's an act of submission.
[01:37:16.106 --> 01:37:23.770]  If you accept that, if you accept the app, the Trace and Track app, which is basically the entree to the social credit score.
[01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:26.892]  Which, let's be clear though, a lot of restaurants and places are making people have in the UK.
[01:37:28.453 --> 01:37:39.044]  Oh yeah, to get into a pub, bylaw or restaurant you have to give your address, your full details for this app, which again is part of the social credit score for the West.
[01:37:39.524 --> 01:37:45.110]  China has openly segwayed this track and trace system into their existing social credit score.
[01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:58.076]  Now with the social credit score which was onerous and dictatorial and an invention of the regime of communist China and that was really bad a year ago and even the mainstream media admitted it.
[01:37:58.456 --> 01:38:01.597]  Oh now suddenly that's good and now that's the global standard.
[01:38:02.058 --> 01:38:07.020]  So you have to download the app not only to travel Alex but to use a taxi.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:11.202]  At the moment in the UK... And now you've got to take a face shot of yourself when you get in the Uber.
[01:38:11.562 --> 01:38:13.183]  So all the corporations are on board.
[01:38:13.203 --> 01:38:18.267]  This is a giant, criminal, racketeering, organized crime, global power grab.
[01:38:18.668 --> 01:38:21.430]  Where is MI5?
[01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:23.251]  Where is Scotland Yard?
[01:38:23.331 --> 01:38:24.532]  Where is the FBI?
[01:38:24.912 --> 01:38:27.294]  Sitting there with their thumbs firmly up there.
[01:38:27.314 --> 01:38:27.935]  You know what?
[01:38:28.355 --> 01:38:29.296]  I mean, this is bad.
[01:38:31.314 --> 01:38:34.455]  Yes, and obviously the final stage is the vaccine.
[01:38:34.735 --> 01:38:42.319]  You're not going to be able to travel, you're not going to be able to use a taxi, you're not going to be able to go to a restaurant, and eventually you're not going to be able to buy food.
[01:38:42.359 --> 01:38:46.601]  It is the mark of the beast that we've been warning about for the past two plus decades.
[01:38:47.241 --> 01:38:49.462]  And then you have the whole Stasi mentality, Alex.
[01:38:50.062 --> 01:38:52.183]  Of course, in the UK we have a situation where
[01:38:53.263 --> 01:38:57.146]  They've put a curfew on the pubs, which means they all close at 10pm.
[01:38:57.606 --> 01:39:04.451]  And what we've seen over the past few days since that was introduced, everyone at 10pm just spills out onto the streets and has a street party.
[01:39:04.791 --> 01:39:08.654]  So even if you believe their reason for introducing it, it's completely ineffective.
[01:39:09.454 --> 01:39:13.477]  No, it's about economic power to shut down their competition and let box stores stay open.
[01:39:14.485 --> 01:39:16.607]  Yeah, and it's about the Stasi state.
[01:39:16.687 --> 01:39:24.532]  Now, as you mentioned, we have literal Covid enforcer marshals peering into people's windows, looking through people's letterboxes.
[01:39:24.972 --> 01:39:30.616]  But again, there aren't enough of them to control 60 odd million people who live in the United Kingdom.
[01:39:30.636 --> 01:39:32.037]  So what does the government say?
[01:39:32.838 --> 01:39:37.001]  Literally came out and said, no, you need to start spying on your neighbours.
[01:39:37.341 --> 01:39:38.702]  And as we know how that works,
[01:39:39.349 --> 01:39:43.611]  Even if people think they're enforcing these health dictates because they're good people.
[01:39:43.891 --> 01:39:56.635]  We know that in the vast majority of cases, the people who act like that, the curtain twitcher grasses, do so because either their lives are so pathetic and miserable that it gives them this sense of power, this sense of self-importance.
[01:39:57.308 --> 01:40:00.271]  Or in many cases, it's because they hate their own neighbors.
[01:40:00.772 --> 01:40:05.657]  Because we've been so atomized and the threads of society have been pulled apart, we don't even talk to our own neighbors anymore.
[01:40:05.677 --> 01:40:07.198]  And now they pay them any excuses.
[01:40:07.238 --> 01:40:08.940]  Snitches get rewards, like L.A.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:09.120]  said.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:13.965]  Literally going around looking through people's keyholes to make sure no one's inside.
[01:40:14.005 --> 01:40:16.507]  I mean, this is like archetypally ridiculous.
[01:40:16.848 --> 01:40:19.831]  While the borders open, and unlimited Muslims are brought in.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:26.935]  Oh yeah, like record amounts of boat migrants coming in every single day on the South Coast.
[01:40:27.256 --> 01:40:29.802]  We're coming in now in a week that came in the previous year.
[01:40:30.987 --> 01:40:39.910]  Yeah, despite the fact that right now we have the ongoing trial of the Manchester bomber who maimed and murdered dozens of kids at a concert in northern Israel.
[01:40:39.930 --> 01:40:42.491]  And they never say they're Islamic, even though they screamed Allah Akbar.
[01:40:42.891 --> 01:40:50.193]  Yeah, and he was brought in on a boat as a refugee, as were many of the Paris massacre terrorists, but no one cares about that.
[01:40:50.513 --> 01:40:55.735]  What's important is closing the pubs at 10pm, because apparently coronavirus has a
[01:40:56.295 --> 01:40:57.216]  We're good to go.
[01:41:15.666 --> 01:41:22.914]  If we can get the government to realize how they've been chumped by big tech and how big tech is taking over in absentia, we may be able to reverse it.
[01:41:22.954 --> 01:41:26.839]  Paul Joseph Watson in one more segment with us will break down what's happening.
[01:41:26.859 --> 01:41:31.244]  The laboratory, the laboratory, potato, tomato.
[01:41:33.291 --> 01:41:35.972]  Is the UK and Australia and now it's coming here.
[01:41:36.532 --> 01:41:37.513]  How do we stand against it?
[01:41:37.533 --> 01:41:40.314]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News.
[01:41:40.334 --> 01:41:41.575]  What a good looking website.
[01:41:42.195 --> 01:41:43.456]  I want InfoWars to look that good.
[01:41:43.476 --> 01:41:44.876]  We're about to redesign InfoWars.
[01:41:45.276 --> 01:41:45.777]  Stay with us.
[01:41:46.997 --> 01:41:48.698]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:41:48.758 --> 01:41:50.759]  Paul Joseph Watson from London, England joins us.
[01:41:56.161 --> 01:41:58.022]  So Paul, let's get right to it.
[01:41:59.667 --> 01:42:03.169]  Let's pull back onto the big picture here and then get into the minutiae.
[01:42:05.931 --> 01:42:09.153]  Everything we've talked about has actually come true exactly like we said it would.
[01:42:10.033 --> 01:42:16.317]  So the system tried to censor us and others, but instead you go to like any Joe Rogan video
[01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:19.673]  On other subjects, it's like, where's Alex Jones?
[01:42:19.713 --> 01:42:20.454]  Where's Alex Jones?
[01:42:20.474 --> 01:42:21.134]  Where's Alex Jones?
[01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:22.936]  I'm not trying to write myself into the story.
[01:42:22.956 --> 01:42:23.356]  It's true.
[01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:29.542]  I mean, I've got the White House calling me up, national talk show host calling me up, going, well, what's going to happen next, Jones?
[01:42:30.483 --> 01:42:37.309]  Only because our perspective has been correct watching the globalist, not what they put out in the media, but what their real agenda is.
[01:42:37.369 --> 01:42:43.134]  And so as the rest of people start looking at the world from our angle and realize that it was the real angle,
[01:42:43.775 --> 01:42:44.916]  It's not what we're even saying.
[01:42:44.936 --> 01:42:46.617]  They're just looking through the same keyhole we are.
[01:42:47.158 --> 01:42:51.841]  That's got to really scare the globalists because charity doesn't usually go well.
[01:42:51.901 --> 01:42:53.703]  Why do they think that they're going to get away with this, Paul?
[01:42:55.544 --> 01:42:57.646]  Well, it's like you were saying during the break, Alex.
[01:42:58.026 --> 01:43:01.649]  They want to take as big a bite as possible and see how much they can swallow.
[01:43:02.129 --> 01:43:07.834]  Obviously, there's going to be mass resistance at some point, and it's already proving to be the case.
[01:43:09.230 --> 01:43:13.374]  This is the biggest imposition on liberty that the Western world has seen in modern times.
[01:43:13.454 --> 01:43:14.656]  It's completely draconian.
[01:43:15.396 --> 01:43:25.107]  But the downside to it from the UK perspective was that they did a poll last week and said that 62% of the population would support another lockdown.
[01:43:25.802 --> 01:43:36.086]  And it's like, we've already got a second lockdown in the UK because they're doing it all regionally, while saying, oh, there's not a national lockdown, we just lock down every local region in the country.
[01:43:36.106 --> 01:43:38.848]  Same thing they do here and it's all under UN directives, exactly.
[01:43:38.908 --> 01:43:42.889]  So, we have to get back to the republic form of government.
[01:43:43.209 --> 01:43:46.651]  If 55% want to enslave the other 45, they don't have a right, Paul.
[01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:58.930]  Precisely, and that's what the mask wearing is about, the eradication of individuality, which is what Orwell wrote about, which is what other dystopian authors wrote about 70, 80 years ago.
[01:43:58.950 --> 01:44:01.272]  In fact, I did an article on that.
[01:44:02.653 --> 01:44:07.877]  Author of dystopian classics predicted face masks to enforce conformity 90 years ago.
[01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:25.491]  And then George Orwell, that was an author called Ernst Jünger in a book called The Worker, by the way, where he envisaged the entire population being forced to wear a mask to eliminate their individuality and enable them to be easily controlled by a central authoritarian state.
[01:44:26.112 --> 01:44:41.280]  And then you had the Orwell quote from 1984 where he calls the masses a nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, 300 million people all with the same face.
[01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:49.185]  So if they can get people to look the same under threat of fines and imprisonment, far easier to control them and get them to think the same.
[01:44:49.205 --> 01:44:51.626]  Think what it does for children.
[01:44:52.554 --> 01:44:58.983]  For their whole human development, we know that instincts are an archetypal genetic impression of events that happen.
[01:44:59.403 --> 01:45:05.631]  We've never seen, children have never been made to wear a mask, they've never been suffocated, they've never seen other humans wearing masks.
[01:45:05.992 --> 01:45:07.734]  This is an evolutionary attack.
[01:45:07.774 --> 01:45:09.677]  This is very scientific, what they're doing.
[01:45:11.294 --> 01:45:27.709]  And what's even more chilling about it is I see parents with their children going into restaurants and things like that and it's like the father will forget or refuse to wash his hands with the hand sanitizer and it'll be the kid who like drags the father back and demands that he do it.
[01:45:28.050 --> 01:45:31.173]  So obviously children are far more easily terrified and yeah.
[01:45:32.254 --> 01:45:39.019]  For example, 86% increase in prescriptions of psychotropic drugs, and many of those will be minus.
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:42.783]  Massive increase in suicide, third world dying, we know it's evil, we know it's a plan.
[01:45:43.083 --> 01:45:44.064]  You wanted to get into that.
[01:45:44.084 --> 01:45:56.414]  The universities in the US, the UK, Australia are now prisons, where they make you have tracking apps everywhere you go, you have to sit alone at the lunches, but now if you don't come to the lunch, you don't get food.
[01:45:56.695 --> 01:45:59.077]  I mean, they're literally Milgram Experiment here.
[01:46:00.595 --> 01:46:01.276]  Completely, yeah.
[01:46:01.516 --> 01:46:06.721]  And this is all based on the premise, by the way, that we're having a surge in coronavirus cases.
[01:46:07.382 --> 01:46:13.888]  Alex, they're testing 12 times more people than they tested in April at the height of the pandemic.
[01:46:13.928 --> 01:46:15.870]  So obviously you're going to get more cases.
[01:46:16.431 --> 01:46:21.276]  They tested a piece of fruit in Tanzania for coronavirus and it had coronavirus.
[01:46:21.696 --> 01:46:25.837]  So the hospitalization numbers, the death numbers, have completely flatlined.
[01:46:25.857 --> 01:46:27.337]  That's right, Pauline, it's worse.
[01:46:27.357 --> 01:46:28.678]  You have an article at Summit.News.
[01:46:29.118 --> 01:46:32.199]  Students threat with police action for displaying anti-lockdown signs.
[01:46:32.699 --> 01:46:32.999]  Help!
[01:46:33.159 --> 01:46:35.059]  They're in there locked in their rooms for months.
[01:46:35.379 --> 01:46:35.699]  Help!
[01:46:35.939 --> 01:46:37.440]  And they go, oh, you can't even do that.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.360]  You pay to go to a prison.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:44.761]  Because the left, I have the articles, admitted, they said, look, the Stanford and the Milgram experiments worked.
[01:46:44.801 --> 01:46:47.062]  People learning to be prisoners and to be guards.
[01:46:47.182 --> 01:46:47.922]  Let's just do it.
[01:46:48.002 --> 01:46:48.622]  And they did it.
[01:46:48.842 --> 01:46:50.863]  They're doing a giant Milgram experiment, Paul.
[01:46:52.478 --> 01:47:08.529]  Yeah, this is across universities across the country, by the way, but in this case, Manchester Metropolitan University, they're literally posting signs outside the halls of residence saying, help me, let us out, because they've been told they're not going to be able to leave.
[01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:15.013]  They've posted police and security guards at the gates of these residences, preventing them from physically leaving.
[01:47:15.433 --> 01:47:19.836]  The students are being told they're not going to be able to go home at Christmas to see their own families.
[01:47:20.136 --> 01:47:22.158]  They can't even go out and buy food.
[01:47:22.658 --> 01:47:25.740]  Because of this arbitrary new lockdown that they've been placed under.
[01:47:26.181 --> 01:47:32.105]  And then you talk about the students sitting alone at diners eating.
[01:47:32.605 --> 01:47:36.728]  They've been told that they have to sit alone at exam-style desks.
[01:47:37.209 --> 01:47:38.670]  They can't talk to anyone.
[01:47:38.970 --> 01:47:41.412]  There are security guards pacing up and down the hallway.
[01:47:41.432 --> 01:47:42.393]  And they don't get a choice of food.
[01:47:42.433 --> 01:47:43.473]  They don't get a choice of food.
[01:47:43.794 --> 01:47:47.176]  Even though there's a cafeteria, they're given what they're allowed to have.
[01:47:47.216 --> 01:47:48.097]  It's all a desk.
[01:47:48.377 --> 01:47:49.678]  It's all to see what they'll put up with.
[01:47:50.563 --> 01:47:51.363]  This is worse.
[01:47:51.563 --> 01:47:57.364]  At least if you're in a prison, you get to talk to the other inmates when you're eating or when you go out in the yard or whatever.
[01:47:57.724 --> 01:47:59.465]  They're literally being told to sit down.
[01:47:59.725 --> 01:48:02.145]  Oh, by the way, it's also happening in pubs, right?
[01:48:02.165 --> 01:48:04.146]  You have to wear a mask to go into a pub.
[01:48:04.166 --> 01:48:05.646]  When you sit down, you can take it off.
[01:48:06.006 --> 01:48:11.327]  If you stand up while you're at the table, some jobs... Same thing in the US.
[01:48:11.647 --> 01:48:13.928]  When I date, my wife said, just wear the mask, we can get a dinner.
[01:48:15.608 --> 01:48:17.729]  I don't put it on going to the bathroom, they start yelling at me.
[01:48:17.909 --> 01:48:18.589]  I just ignored them.
[01:48:18.609 --> 01:48:19.609]  But I mean, yes, that's happening.
[01:48:20.643 --> 01:48:22.104]  Yeah, same thing with me.
[01:48:22.184 --> 01:48:32.231]  Literally in a restaurant, three feet to the door, went out the door to smoke a cigarette, came back in without the mask, and they sat me down and had a serious, stern conversation with me.
[01:48:32.671 --> 01:48:39.956]  And again, most people don't want to enforce such ridiculous measures, but some people get off on that because their lives are pretty miserable.
[01:48:39.976 --> 01:48:42.878]  And they're the idiots that are bringing in a total global financial collapse, Paul.
[01:48:44.739 --> 01:48:49.222]  Yeah, which, by the way, China has now avoided because, as you've been talking about during the show,
[01:48:50.134 --> 01:49:04.939]  It's now confirmed what we already knew, that they had this army of bots going to all the Twitter threads of countries that were considering herd immunity, like Sweden which did successfully, and the United Kingdom which originally considered herd immunity.
[01:49:05.399 --> 01:49:05.720]  All right.
[01:49:22.319 --> 01:49:26.082]  And their economy would survive and ours would crumble, which is exactly what's happening.
[01:49:26.203 --> 01:49:30.106]  Paul, I know you're with your parents that came to visit, and you've got a dinner that's ready to eat.
[01:49:30.526 --> 01:49:32.208]  Let's go to break, though.
[01:49:32.228 --> 01:49:34.009]  James O keeps coming on halfway in the next segment.
[01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:37.512]  But since you mentioned this, that's what I wanted you on about, and I forgot that's why.
[01:49:37.853 --> 01:49:38.913]  We'll be going off on the other area.
[01:49:39.534 --> 01:49:42.276]  This huge report at InfoWars.com, Summit.News.
[01:49:43.297 --> 01:49:44.778]  Everyone should flood the White House with it.
[01:49:45.358 --> 01:49:48.360]  You went, and they've got the huge research paper showing all this.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:51.662]  When I read it, we already knew all this, but it's all in one research paper.
[01:49:52.063 --> 01:49:52.943]  We've got to get this out.
[01:49:52.963 --> 01:49:54.564]  Do a few minutes on the other side on this.
[01:49:54.984 --> 01:49:57.726]  So it goes mega viral, and then James O'Keefe is coming up.
[01:49:58.046 --> 01:49:59.827]  PaulJosephWatsonSummit.News.
[01:49:59.887 --> 01:50:01.248]  It's a beautiful, excellent site.
[01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:02.089]  We love it.
[01:50:02.129 --> 01:50:03.990]  We're trying to build a site just as good ourselves.
[01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:05.211]  We're redoing InfoWars.
[01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:06.792]  It should be relaunched within a week.
[01:50:07.512 --> 01:50:09.133]  Yes, I just made that announcement.
[01:50:09.513 --> 01:50:11.214]  The new InfoWars is about to be born.
[01:50:11.714 --> 01:50:12.515]  Stay with us.
[01:50:12.775 --> 01:50:15.737]  35 days to election.
[01:50:16.037 --> 01:50:15.737]  113.
[01:50:16.057 --> 01:50:16.897]  113 until inauguration.
[01:50:19.398 --> 01:50:25.502]  Alright folks, we are back live with Paul Joseph Watson, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas, who just knocked it out of the park.
[01:50:27.008 --> 01:50:29.009]  is going to be joining us coming up next segment.
[01:50:29.169 --> 01:50:31.931]  Briefly, we're going to do live coverage.
[01:50:32.151 --> 01:50:32.992]  I mean, 8 a.m.
[01:50:33.012 --> 01:50:38.995]  the show starts tomorrow at InfoWars, but for voting information, you're not supposed to look at or share or check into.
[01:50:39.015 --> 01:50:44.058]  This is so accurate, so hardcore, and so truthful, and so God-based, family-based, and red-blooded.
[01:50:44.719 --> 01:50:51.263]  But we've got live coverage tomorrow night, last hour of the War Room, and then I'll be hosting right through with Owen and
[01:50:51.983 --> 01:50:55.164]  Savannah Hernandez and, uh, all the rest of the great crew.
[01:50:55.184 --> 01:50:56.164]  Donald Lorraine.
[01:50:56.504 --> 01:50:59.305]  The first Trump versus Biden presidential debate.
[01:51:00.005 --> 01:51:01.326]  Live coverage begins at 5 p.m.
[01:51:01.366 --> 01:51:02.566]  Central at band.video.
[01:51:02.986 --> 01:51:04.687]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:51:05.247 --> 01:51:08.068]  And of course, uh, all of our other great sites.
[01:51:08.088 --> 01:51:09.368]  You should probably add on that banner.
[01:51:09.748 --> 01:51:10.569]  2020electioncenter.com.
[01:51:11.929 --> 01:51:16.630]  Because if you try to send out banned video, Twitter blocks it, but 2020electioncenter.com, they don't.
[01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:18.831]  So remember that, my fellow info warriors.
[01:51:18.891 --> 01:51:23.312]  If you want to win and defeat the globalists, they're counting on you not realizing how important you are.
[01:51:23.932 --> 01:51:26.192]  But Paul, you wrote this big article this morning.
[01:51:26.272 --> 01:51:28.733]  I spent hours researching the white paper.
[01:51:28.773 --> 01:51:37.455]  It's connected to China's global lockdown propaganda campaign, their own admissions research shows deliberate Chinese propaganda campaign, force world into lockdown.
[01:51:38.135 --> 01:51:41.958]  Spend four or five minutes on how huge this is and what this signifies.
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:44.501]  Okay, Alex.
[01:51:44.881 --> 01:51:53.808]  Well, the global lockdown, as we now know, has been the biggest imposition on human liberty, on human rights, indeed, in the entire modern era.
[01:51:54.569 --> 01:51:58.933]  Not just in terms of sacrificed liberties, but also in terms of sacrificed lives.
[01:51:59.633 --> 01:52:03.597]  All the top experts who, by the way, get silenced immediately when they say this,
[01:52:04.386 --> 01:52:11.768]  I've stated the fact, which is that the lockdown will cause exponentially more deaths than the coronavirus itself.
[01:52:11.828 --> 01:52:14.029]  We're talking about excess cancer deaths.
[01:52:14.389 --> 01:52:17.130]  We're talking about untreated TB infections.
[01:52:17.610 --> 01:52:22.772]  We're talking about the horrendous impact on mental health that this will have.
[01:52:22.832 --> 01:52:25.453]  We're talking about ruined relationships.
[01:52:25.513 --> 01:52:28.093]  We're talking about ruined economies.
[01:52:28.534 --> 01:52:32.775]  Poverty, which of course directly leads to an exponential rise in deaths.
[01:52:33.973 --> 01:52:38.237]  And this all originated from, of course, Wuhan, China.
[01:52:38.997 --> 01:52:50.187]  And as many people rightly say, from the virology lab there in Wuhan, China, of course, where they were studying the horseshoe bat, which wasn't for sale in the Wuhan meat market.
[01:52:50.387 --> 01:52:54.231]  All the evidence suggests that it was leaked from that lab.
[01:52:54.791 --> 01:53:01.057]  But in the immediate aftermath of that, of course, we saw China impose the most draconian lockdown that we've seen across the world.
[01:53:02.572 --> 01:53:05.315]  In Wuhan and surrounding areas of Hubei province.
[01:53:06.637 --> 01:53:14.025]  Funnily enough, though, if you look at the death rates for China compared to the United States from coronavirus, quite the difference.
[01:53:14.866 --> 01:53:21.234]  China recorded officially 4,600 deaths from coronavirus, whereas the US death toll currently stands at over 205,000.
[01:53:23.937 --> 01:53:52.835]  Now we have this research paper which was published by Tablet Magazine, headline research shows deliberate Chinese propaganda campaign forced world into lockdown, where attorney and researcher Michael P. Senga documents in extreme detail how the Chinese government launched an aggressive propaganda campaign to exaggerate the severity of coronavirus in order to force the rest of the world into a draconian lockdown that would serve to benefit Beijing.
[01:53:53.692 --> 01:53:56.995]  Now he cites the videos that we all saw back in January.
[01:53:58.076 --> 01:53:59.657]  And by the way, some of us fell for this.
[01:53:59.797 --> 01:54:10.886]  I tweeted these videos too, many other people did, of people collapsing, hyperventilating, vomiting on the streets in China.
[01:54:11.206 --> 01:54:19.853]  Now in hindsight, we know that that's not really what happens with coronavirus, but at the time it was very dramatic, it was very hysterical.
[01:54:20.374 --> 01:54:23.336]  Problem is, a lot of these videos turned out to be fake.
[01:54:24.344 --> 01:54:34.986]  Including one that Senga cites, where a guy is seen collapsing on the street, yet he immediately breaks the fall with his own arm, suggesting the collapse was staged.
[01:54:36.546 --> 01:54:52.909]  He writes that after tens of millions of people were confined to their homes during one of the most brutally enforced lockdowns in history, the CCP reported an exponential decline in coronavirus cases until March 19th, when they announced their lockdown had eliminated domestic cases entirely.
[01:54:54.477 --> 01:55:09.820]  So the World Health Organization, the World Bank, every major health authority in the West waxed lyrical about China's draconian response to COVID-19 because they thought it had been a whopping success.
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:12.660]  And they then began to mirror that approach.
[01:55:13.461 --> 01:55:20.682]  The problem being that China launched an aggressive propaganda campaign, and Senga documents this at length,
[01:55:21.331 --> 01:55:33.579]  To disparage any health authority, any Western leader, any government who was looking like they would go against the Chinese model and go for herd immunity.
[01:55:34.179 --> 01:55:46.847]  Now we know for a fact that herd immunity was the way to go because we look at Sweden, which has a lower death rate than any other European country, which has come out of this with a better economy than any other European country.
[01:55:47.228 --> 01:55:49.149]  Sweden did not lock down.
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:56:07.239]  But Senga documents how Chinese bot accounts, armies of them, were instrumental in promoting early lockdowns in countries like Italy, while bombarding political figures who refused to order strict lockdowns, such as South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, with criticism and abuse.
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:11.464]  So they went after every leader, politically, and every country,
[01:56:12.273 --> 01:56:19.857]  That suggested that they would go for herd immunity and reject this draconian social credit score Chinese lockdown.
[01:56:20.538 --> 01:56:22.799]  Of course, most governments chose that course.
[01:56:23.199 --> 01:56:25.801]  Most governments have completely ruined their economies.
[01:56:26.861 --> 01:56:33.125]  Jobless numbers through the roof, untreated illnesses, untreated cancers, untreated TB infections.
[01:56:33.605 --> 01:56:39.709]  The cost of lockdown is going to be infinitely greater than the cost of coronavirus.
[01:56:40.202 --> 01:56:52.865]  And as Senga documents in this article, it was all planned from the very beginning via a massive, sophisticated propaganda campaign by the Communist Chinese government, which has now come out of this.
[01:56:53.626 --> 01:56:56.746]  We saw pull parties in Wuhan weeks ago.
[01:56:57.247 --> 01:56:57.967]  No lockdown.
[01:56:58.007 --> 01:56:59.127]  It's all been lifted.
[01:56:59.187 --> 01:57:01.268]  Their economy's coming out of it just fine.
[01:57:01.588 --> 01:57:09.690]  Whereas in the West, we're still being pummeled by these insane measures which have ruined our economies, ruined
[01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:10.750]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:57:10.770 --> 01:57:11.051]  Take care.
[01:57:38.447 --> 01:57:44.529]  And we'll take that little five minutes where he just knocked out of the park, post it to Band.Video, the only place you'll get that information and be able to share it.
[01:57:44.929 --> 01:57:48.230]  Or you can roll over the Chi-Coms and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and let them win.
[01:57:48.250 --> 01:57:49.530]  I don't think you want to.
[01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:51.410]  No, I think we're going to win together.
[01:57:51.850 --> 01:57:52.171]  Aren't we?
[01:57:52.251 --> 01:57:52.891]  I can smell it.
[01:57:53.431 --> 01:57:54.011]  I can taste it.
[01:57:54.031 --> 01:57:54.531]  I can feel it.
[01:57:54.871 --> 01:57:57.652]  Maybe we should start the next segment with that, you belong in the city.
[01:57:59.366 --> 01:58:01.147]  Because that's what it really comes down to.
[01:58:01.167 --> 01:58:02.028]  It's our country.
[01:58:02.088 --> 01:58:02.808]  It's our world.
[01:58:03.149 --> 01:58:10.174]  We're building a pro-human future based on justice and freedom, not based on lies and propaganda and authoritarianism and what elitist groups are part of.
[01:58:10.194 --> 01:58:12.675]  This is a nightmare and we're not going along with it.
[01:58:14.136 --> 01:58:16.098]  Separately, it is the final day.
[01:58:17.648 --> 01:58:23.231]  Of this biggest special ever on the already high quality, discounted, storable food at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:23.251 --> 01:58:35.779]  We have the full catalog, two-year supplies, one-year supply, six-month supply, three-month supply, their readiness groups, their cook stoves, their water filtration, their oil filtration, the full product line, lowest price, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:35.879 --> 01:58:38.741]  Except in the contract, we can only get their lowest price.
[01:58:39.341 --> 01:58:43.684]  They can only do specials, which they never do, with a special URL on their official site.
[01:58:44.625 --> 01:58:54.950]  My Patreon, which is PrepareWithAlex.com, where you can get a three-month supply and others with massive discounts already on the discounts you get as a promotional.
[01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:56.831]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:58:57.271 --> 01:58:58.572]  This is the last day, 13 hours.
[01:59:01.082 --> 01:59:05.905]  17 minutes and four seconds as we are live right now at 142 Central.
[01:59:05.945 --> 01:59:07.907]  Later this will be rebroadcast on a lot of stations.
[01:59:08.687 --> 01:59:20.416]  And by the way, this group cannot extend that sale out another day because the water filter, the big high-quality stainless steel water filter, the highest rated gravity-filled filter, is very low in its supply.
[01:59:20.856 --> 01:59:22.457]  And so they're going to have to end that special.
[01:59:22.477 --> 01:59:24.919]  We will be ending this special in 13 hours.
[01:59:25.299 --> 01:59:28.021]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA.
[01:59:29.603 --> 01:59:34.127]  There's also the Infowars Emergency Election Sale Total Blowout.
[01:59:34.147 --> 01:59:35.568]  30 to 60% off on free shipping.
[01:59:35.608 --> 01:59:45.438]  That's going to end soon on things like Winter Sun Plus for your immune system, Vitamin Mineral Fusion for your immune system, bodies, turmeric, and of course DNA Force Plus.
[01:59:45.478 --> 01:59:46.859]  DNA Force is the key one to get.
[01:59:46.979 --> 01:59:48.501]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:49.842]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:49.862 --> 01:59:50.363]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:51.178 --> 01:59:54.979]  James O'Keefe here in downtown Minneapolis at the scene of the crime.
[01:59:54.999 --> 01:59:58.661]  The person you're about to meet, Liban Mohamed, a.k.a.
[01:59:59.041 --> 02:00:04.063]  King Liban One, boasts about the hundreds of absentee ballots in his car.
[02:00:04.583 --> 02:00:05.503]  Numbers don't lie.
[02:00:05.583 --> 02:00:06.424]  Numbers don't lie.
[02:00:18.998 --> 02:00:25.381]  There was video.
[02:00:25.541 --> 02:00:26.402]  You could see the video.
[02:00:26.442 --> 02:00:30.464]  There was a video out and about that he has the ballots in his car.
[02:00:30.824 --> 02:00:31.045]  Right.
[02:00:31.305 --> 02:00:35.127]  And talking about the only way you can win is with money.
[02:00:35.347 --> 02:00:36.748]  I was looking at them and they were not filled.
[02:00:36.788 --> 02:00:38.069]  They were blank.
[02:00:38.289 --> 02:00:40.570]  Who is the one filling out the absentee ballots?
[02:00:41.491 --> 02:00:44.853]  People who work, like in Pan Omar.
[02:00:45.777 --> 02:00:46.778]  Where do they pay the money?
[02:00:47.298 --> 02:00:50.020]  Alright, the full report is at ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:51.581]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[02:00:51.641 --> 02:00:58.907]  And every time I think James O'Keefe, in the last 15 years of his work, 12 years, whatever it is, can be topped, he does it again.
[02:00:59.427 --> 02:01:00.928]  Very honored to have him for this segment.
[02:01:00.948 --> 02:01:01.329]  The next...
[02:01:02.665 --> 02:01:03.346]  James O'Keefe
[02:01:21.944 --> 02:01:24.867]  You don't see journalism like this on 60 Minutes anymore.
[02:01:25.308 --> 02:01:26.169]  You're doing it.
[02:01:26.529 --> 02:01:30.853]  The president's obviously responded, called for a criminal investigation 35 days out.
[02:01:31.334 --> 02:01:34.497]  They're catching him doing ballot harvesting all over the country.
[02:01:34.777 --> 02:01:37.720]  They're catching him mailing in the names of dead people everywhere.
[02:01:38.141 --> 02:01:40.223]  I mean, this is a concerted fraud that you've just
[02:01:40.743 --> 02:01:41.764]  Knocked it out of the park.
[02:01:41.784 --> 02:01:43.204]  You've got Ken Paxson in Texas.
[02:01:43.224 --> 02:01:45.845]  130-something indictments for the similar thing.
[02:01:46.246 --> 02:01:48.687]  Wow, this is really painting a very clear picture right now.
[02:01:49.267 --> 02:01:51.508]  But just incredible job getting this done.
[02:01:51.608 --> 02:01:52.348]  How did you do it?
[02:01:53.009 --> 02:01:54.549]  Tell us what's unfolded and what's coming.
[02:01:55.470 --> 02:01:57.131]  Well, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:01:57.791 --> 02:02:03.413]  This is Somali insiders in Minneapolis, Ward 6 there in Minnesota.
[02:02:03.934 --> 02:02:06.755]  And these are people in the community who wore these cameras.
[02:02:06.775 --> 02:02:08.996]  Some of these are ballot harvesters on tape.
[02:02:09.719 --> 02:02:10.780]  Saying what they're doing.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.622]  These tapes are obtained by these insiders.
[02:02:14.102 --> 02:02:18.205]  And Alex, this is the first time we've ever actually seen the incontrovertible evidence.
[02:02:18.645 --> 02:02:20.026]  We've heard hearsay.
[02:02:20.086 --> 02:02:21.988]  We've heard circumstantial evidence.
[02:02:22.028 --> 02:02:22.788]  But there you see it.
[02:02:22.908 --> 02:02:24.309]  It kind of speaks for itself.
[02:02:24.409 --> 02:02:27.972]  The guy is in the car bragging about having 300 ballots.
[02:02:28.012 --> 02:02:30.354]  It's a state crime to obtain more than three ballots.
[02:02:31.134 --> 02:02:36.438]  And there's also a federal crime involved because they're going around to the residential communities
[02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:43.361]  And they're coercing people and paying them and saying you must vote for Ilhan Omar and Jamal Hosni.
[02:02:43.381 --> 02:02:45.022]  I mean, is that not classic racketeering?
[02:02:45.062 --> 02:02:47.022]  Not just civil rights violation, election fraud?
[02:02:48.342 --> 02:02:49.463]  Oh, it's a whole host of crimes.
[02:02:49.503 --> 02:02:50.703]  I got the crimes here.
[02:02:51.223 --> 02:02:54.464]  The jurisdiction is the 18 U.S.C.
[02:02:54.984 --> 02:02:56.244]  597, 52 U.S.C.
[02:02:57.204 --> 02:02:56.244]  10307.
[02:02:57.664 --> 02:03:00.365]  It's also a state and federal law regarding intimidation of voters.
[02:03:00.425 --> 02:03:03.565]  So, I don't know where the FBI is on this, Alex.
[02:03:03.645 --> 02:03:06.066]  I know that the director of the FBI said last week
[02:03:06.921 --> 02:03:16.803]  There is no voter fraud, so when the leader of the Bureau of Investigation is saying there's no evidence of something, maybe the FBI is more upset at me for exposing it.
[02:03:17.384 --> 02:03:24.845]  I don't know if they intend to actually do anything about this, but as long as nobody will do anything about it, Alex, Project Veritas will be there to do something about it.
[02:03:25.185 --> 02:03:28.146]  Well look, you're not about praise, you're about results.
[02:03:28.426 --> 02:03:32.687]  This is, of all the stuff you've knocked out of the park, you just keep topping it.
[02:03:33.047 --> 02:03:34.688]  Is this probably the biggest coup yet?
[02:03:34.708 --> 02:03:35.488]  This is insane.
[02:03:36.482 --> 02:03:38.623]  Yes, by implication it certainly is.
[02:03:38.923 --> 02:03:42.906]  This is about our election systems, and people say this stuff doesn't happen.
[02:03:42.946 --> 02:03:45.827]  They say there's no evidence of voter fraud, that it's not systemic.
[02:03:45.907 --> 02:03:51.371]  Well, this video shows systemic evidence of voter fraud in Minnesota, which is a swing state in the presidential election.
[02:03:51.391 --> 02:03:56.253]  Well, when the FBI was corrupt by Bill Close and Osler until the mid-50s, they said it didn't exist, remember?
[02:03:56.654 --> 02:04:00.076]  Until there was the tape of the guys meeting in the farmhouse in, like, Connecticut.
[02:04:01.016 --> 02:04:09.058]  We all know Italian Mafia exists, so to say that election fraud doesn't exist is like saying bears don't crap in the woods, and you've just shown it on video here.
[02:04:10.058 --> 02:04:12.999]  Yeah, people say there's no fraud.
[02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:19.860]  It's self-evident how ridiculous it is for the director of the FBI to say there's no evidence of fraud.
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:27.982]  Anytime you have tens of millions of ballots laying around, anytime you have that happen, there's going to be some aspects of fraud.
[02:04:28.002 --> 02:04:28.882]  In this case, we've seen
[02:04:29.338 --> 02:04:30.899]  Hundreds of ballots in the car.
[02:04:31.359 --> 02:04:36.982]  We've seen a guy bragging that he's being paid to do this.
[02:04:37.002 --> 02:04:40.023]  I mean, I don't know what more evidence you need.
[02:04:40.043 --> 02:04:43.405]  I don't know, if this is not evidence, what is?
[02:04:43.425 --> 02:04:47.827]  I hope the Attorney General responds to this.
[02:04:47.947 --> 02:04:49.608]  I hope they have a press conference.
[02:04:49.648 --> 02:04:53.130]  I hope Trump, there is on the screen, you see the source who recorded a lot of this.
[02:04:53.150 --> 02:04:55.131]  This man's name is Omar Jamal.
[02:04:55.451 --> 02:04:56.672]  And Alex, a lot of these guys,
[02:04:57.287 --> 02:05:00.728]  In the Somali community are fearing for their life right now.
[02:05:00.748 --> 02:05:02.909]  I was about to say, these guys are risking their lives.
[02:05:03.710 --> 02:05:04.230]  They are, 100%.
[02:05:04.990 --> 02:05:09.512]  I think the reason why they're going to be okay is the publicity of it, right?
[02:05:09.792 --> 02:05:11.253]  This is all happening in the shadows.
[02:05:11.793 --> 02:05:16.835]  And now that it's come out, and you're doing it, and many people are doing it, it was trending.
[02:05:16.935 --> 02:05:18.415]  It was actually trending on Twitter.
[02:05:18.776 --> 02:05:24.638]  We've gotten half a million tweets on this last night, which is a shock to me that they've allowed it to trend.
[02:05:25.083 --> 02:05:33.567]  But because it's all gone public, I think that these guys are going to be a little more protected, because if anything happens to them now, that just becomes part of the story.
[02:05:33.587 --> 02:05:45.873]  But this gives me hope, because of the Muslim communities that are all insular and very controlled, the Somalis are one of the most controlled, and to see their own people being the knights here, being the good guys exposing this, gives me a lot of hope.
[02:05:47.414 --> 02:05:48.034]  Absolutely.
[02:05:49.055 --> 02:05:51.176]  What I've been told, Alex, by some of these Somalians,
[02:05:52.808 --> 02:06:03.793]  This one individual who we didn't disclose her name, but we showed her voice, is that she said that Ilhan Omar does not give a SHIT about the Somalian community.
[02:06:03.873 --> 02:06:05.813]  That they're victims, right?
[02:06:05.853 --> 02:06:06.954]  They're coerced.
[02:06:07.214 --> 02:06:08.514]  They're told to do this.
[02:06:08.574 --> 02:06:09.075]  No, they get it.
[02:06:09.095 --> 02:06:12.556]  Just like Somalia, they're being set up as a slave class under her.
[02:06:13.476 --> 02:06:14.277]  Pretty much, yes.
[02:06:14.297 --> 02:06:15.397]  That's another way of saying it.
[02:06:15.597 --> 02:06:16.978]  Because they're told to do this.
[02:06:17.038 --> 02:06:18.178]  They're paid to do this.
[02:06:18.678 --> 02:06:21.500]  And they don't care about that community.
[02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:22.280]  It's about power.
[02:06:22.759 --> 02:06:24.140]  This is an open secret.
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:26.021]  It's an open secret there.
[02:06:26.422 --> 02:06:28.003]  Nobody has done anything about it.
[02:06:28.103 --> 02:06:29.484]  I went to the county prosecutor.
[02:06:29.524 --> 02:06:31.525]  He said, it's illegal, but you got to talk to the sheriff.
[02:06:31.906 --> 02:06:32.646]  I go to the sheriff.
[02:06:32.666 --> 02:06:33.647]  They bring me to the other guy.
[02:06:34.067 --> 02:06:37.170]  So nobody, and the FBI director says, there's no evidence of voter fraud.
[02:06:37.530 --> 02:06:40.132]  So nobody's going to do anything about this, Alex.
[02:06:40.172 --> 02:06:42.654]  There's no, there's no, there's no consequence.
[02:06:43.354 --> 02:06:44.475]  It's, it's, I don't know.
[02:06:44.495 --> 02:06:46.496]  I I'm about to release another tape.
[02:06:46.597 --> 02:06:48.138]  I know you're going to ask me what's next.
[02:06:48.158 --> 02:06:51.160]  So I'm going to tell you, I'm about to release a tape of the actual
[02:06:52.302 --> 02:06:54.062]  Money exchange on tape.
[02:06:54.502 --> 02:06:58.863]  I don't know what more I can publish to get people arrested.
[02:06:58.903 --> 02:06:59.943]  I've heard the record skip.
[02:06:59.983 --> 02:07:02.124]  Start over, James O'Keefe.
[02:07:02.164 --> 02:07:02.624]  You're smart.
[02:07:02.664 --> 02:07:04.064]  You know, I always say, what's coming next?
[02:07:04.584 --> 02:07:07.145]  Whoa, you've got the cash being exchanged.
[02:07:07.905 --> 02:07:09.865]  Yeah, we got, I mean, yes.
[02:07:10.485 --> 02:07:11.085]  Yes, we do.
[02:07:11.605 --> 02:07:16.206]  So I don't know what it will take to get people arrested.
[02:07:16.226 --> 02:07:20.927]  I don't know what it will take for anybody to care about the fact that our elections are
[02:07:21.536 --> 02:07:22.217]  Jeopardized.
[02:07:22.717 --> 02:07:28.083]  But what you have here, Alex, is smoking gun, smoking gun evidence.
[02:07:28.924 --> 02:07:31.046]  And the president has tweeted it five times.
[02:07:32.547 --> 02:07:41.717]  I would like to see the Attorney General of the United States devote resources into this and clean this up because you can't trust anything in our society.
[02:07:42.594 --> 02:07:44.635]  If you can't trust the integrity of our elections.
[02:07:44.795 --> 02:07:46.275]  Absolutely, and Trump is on this.
[02:07:46.315 --> 02:07:47.575]  Trump demands U.S.
[02:07:47.635 --> 02:07:53.137]  Attorneys launch an investigation into Ilhan Omar filing a report for supporters of illegally harvested ballots in Minnesota.
[02:07:53.157 --> 02:07:56.778]  We have literally, conservatively, 2 million people an hour tuning in.
[02:07:56.818 --> 02:07:57.278]  We know.
[02:07:57.838 --> 02:08:07.580]  If all of you go get the article at ProjectVeritas.com or Infowars.com and just share it and just send it to the White House or send it to your legislators and say you want action, we'll get it.
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:10.661]  James, what do you think needs to happen with this smoking gun evidence?
[02:08:11.969 --> 02:08:15.932]  I think there needs to be a criminal investigation.
[02:08:16.032 --> 02:08:17.874]  You got people on the tape breaking the law.
[02:08:17.954 --> 02:08:19.195]  It's clear as crystal.
[02:08:19.255 --> 02:08:21.457]  He's in a car with 300 ballots.
[02:08:22.037 --> 02:08:23.338]  It's against state law.
[02:08:24.179 --> 02:08:25.860]  And then the media has to report it.
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:35.628]  We have to, just like we did four years ago with the Cramer investigation in 2016, once people are arrested, once investigations are conducted,
[02:08:36.352 --> 02:08:39.294]  Uh, once that happens, I think it'll force its way into the media.
[02:08:39.574 --> 02:08:43.016]  And the third thing that needs to happen, Alex, is that other whistleblowers need to come forward.
[02:08:43.076 --> 02:08:52.482]  So, if you're watching this program, uh, if you're on the inside, if you have access to, or witness to, specific smoking gun evidence... Don't wait!
[02:08:52.502 --> 02:08:53.383]  Contact now!
[02:08:53.423 --> 02:08:53.963]  How do they do it?
[02:08:54.724 --> 02:08:55.804]  Veritas Tips.
[02:08:55.945 --> 02:08:59.607]  V-E-R-I-T-A-S Tips at Protonmail.com.
[02:09:00.899 --> 02:09:01.219]  Beautiful.
[02:09:01.259 --> 02:09:03.160]  We got five more minutes with you, but a minute till break.
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:15.004]  Radar screen, Pelosi saying she's readying to hold up the election and then under law, January 21st of next year, they will elect her, they're saying as president.
[02:09:15.024 --> 02:09:15.804]  This is insane.
[02:09:17.725 --> 02:09:22.326]  I mean, that's going to be an interesting thing to see what happens.
[02:09:22.426 --> 02:09:25.047]  And I go back to my original point.
[02:09:26.188 --> 02:09:30.349]  These sorts of things you only know about, you only know about
[02:09:31.067 --> 02:09:32.088]  I totally agree with you.
[02:09:32.108 --> 02:09:33.389]  Imagine what you're not getting on tape.
[02:09:33.409 --> 02:09:35.632]  How the hell do you every month get stuff that nobody else gets, James O'Keefe?
[02:09:55.591 --> 02:09:59.213]  Because there's nowhere else for these people to go.
[02:09:59.474 --> 02:10:01.215]  They can't go to anywhere else.
[02:10:01.255 --> 02:10:02.435]  They can't go to the FBI.
[02:10:02.475 --> 02:10:04.557]  Sometimes they can't go to the DOJ.
[02:10:04.577 --> 02:10:05.737]  They can't go to the New York Times.
[02:10:06.157 --> 02:10:10.800]  We're the only organization that allows them to tell their stories right now in this particular way.
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:11.921]  That's why they come to us.
[02:10:12.561 --> 02:10:13.042]  That's right.
[02:10:13.082 --> 02:10:16.203]  Well, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas, you can't make this up, man.
[02:10:16.223 --> 02:10:17.064]  This is reality.
[02:10:17.424 --> 02:10:18.044]  We'll be right back.
[02:10:18.064 --> 02:10:18.445]  Stay with us.
[02:10:19.562 --> 02:10:23.847]  Alex Jones here, back live, final segment with Project Veritas' James O'Keefe.
[02:10:24.227 --> 02:10:28.671]  You imagine being James during the break, two minutes, he's on the phone, he's got more whistleblowers.
[02:10:28.732 --> 02:10:32.055]  It's like he's trying to drink up the Potomac River with a straw.
[02:10:32.515 --> 02:10:36.219]  But you wanted to get in the final five minutes we have into your big report.
[02:10:37.153 --> 02:10:38.733]  It's at ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:10:38.773 --> 02:10:39.874]  It's at Infowars.com.
[02:10:39.894 --> 02:10:41.394]  Whatever you do, folks, share it.
[02:10:41.414 --> 02:10:42.754]  The globalists are trying to block this.
[02:10:43.254 --> 02:10:48.016]  Ilhan Omar connected ballot harvester in cash for ballot scheme.
[02:10:48.436 --> 02:10:49.996]  Car is full of absentee ballots.
[02:10:50.376 --> 02:10:52.237]  That's the full 17-minute report.
[02:10:52.977 --> 02:10:56.878]  For radio listeners, though, people driving down the road, tell them what else is in this.
[02:10:57.898 --> 02:11:04.740]  Well, we have this Somali insider Omar Jamal, and I'm going to refer to my notes here to make sure I get my facts correct.
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:06.220]  Omar Jamal is an insider.
[02:11:06.841 --> 02:11:08.101]  He put on a hidden camera.
[02:11:08.541 --> 02:11:13.943]  It's an open secret, he said, that Ilhan Omar will do anything to get elected.
[02:11:13.983 --> 02:11:17.584]  We spoke with one of these Somalian-American ballot harvesters.
[02:11:18.184 --> 02:11:24.045]  In the tape, the harvester describes how he was paid to vote in the primary elections.
[02:11:24.105 --> 02:11:31.347]  The harvester said that vote-buying operatives from the Omar machine came to his apartment to oversee him filling out paperwork.
[02:11:31.387 --> 02:11:33.908]  So the Omar operatives request the ballot
[02:11:34.397 --> 02:11:35.278]  And then fill them out.
[02:11:35.318 --> 02:11:45.684]  We had another guy, a DFL guy, that's the Democratic Farmer and Labor Party in Minnesota, say that their blank ballots that the man in the car had, that they were blank.
[02:11:46.204 --> 02:11:49.106]  And in many cases, handed right over to the voter.
[02:11:49.126 --> 02:11:53.929]  They quote, they come to us, they come to our homes, this year you will vote for Ilhan.
[02:11:54.369 --> 02:12:02.133]  We will make the absentee ballots, this is translated from Somali to English, quote, we will fill out the forms for you and when you get them back, we will fill it out and send it.
[02:12:04.163 --> 02:12:07.945]  After the ballots are signed and documented, the harvester said he would get paid.
[02:12:08.425 --> 02:12:12.027]  Quote, when we sign the voting document, they fill it out is when they give us the money.
[02:12:12.508 --> 02:12:14.709]  The minute we sign it, that's when we get paid.
[02:12:15.149 --> 02:12:19.811]  So you have multiple people on the record, some speaking English, some speaking Somali.
[02:12:20.292 --> 02:12:24.334]  Most of them, if all but one, do not know that they're being videotaped.
[02:12:25.074 --> 02:12:32.338]  And Alex, this is the first time that the public has ever seen anything
[02:12:33.075 --> 02:12:33.535]  Like this.
[02:12:33.635 --> 02:12:36.117]  We've suspected it, but to see it.
[02:12:36.617 --> 02:12:39.399]  And this guy in the car, his name is Liban Muhammad.
[02:12:39.419 --> 02:12:41.200]  He's the brother of the city council candidate.
[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:46.082]  Liban Muhammad tweeted last night, I'm famous, hashtag Black Lives Matter.
[02:12:46.983 --> 02:12:48.143]  They're so heedless.
[02:12:48.584 --> 02:12:54.047]  They're so shameless that they go out right on the internet and they say, oh, thank goodness I'm famous.
[02:12:54.107 --> 02:12:58.529]  They know that no one's going to lay a finger on them and they can get away with anything.
[02:12:59.029 --> 02:13:01.771]  And this is the time, this is the moment in history when
[02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:07.737]  I think this might actually change things because this video has got 10 million views.
[02:13:08.719 --> 02:13:10.221]  It's trending all over the internet.
[02:13:10.261 --> 02:13:12.083]  The president has asked for an investigation.
[02:13:12.103 --> 02:13:15.628]  I think people are fed up and I think something's about to change.
[02:13:17.429 --> 02:13:20.730]  I totally agree, and it's the arrogance of criminals.
[02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:25.991]  It's like when they caught ISIS launching chemical attacks against Assad to blame Assad.
[02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:26.891]  I'm not a fan of Assad.
[02:13:27.732 --> 02:13:30.472]  They were screaming, Allah Akbar, launching the chemical attack.
[02:13:30.572 --> 02:13:34.153]  Or when jihadi staged terror attacks and later people say, oh, it didn't really happen.
[02:13:34.493 --> 02:13:35.493]  They're bragging about it.
[02:13:35.513 --> 02:13:37.074]  I mean, the fact that criminals brag.
[02:13:37.714 --> 02:13:54.205]  And you've got them on video now, and the fact like 10 million views, just one video, the president's responded, where Ilhan Omar says there's no such thing as ballast harvesting, there's no such thing as election fraud, there's no such thing as mail-ins being abused, and on top of everything else coming out, you've got this.
[02:13:54.345 --> 02:13:54.685]  Wow!
[02:13:55.225 --> 02:14:00.809]  I mean, so I guess, did you get contacted by good American Somalis that didn't want to be part of this?
[02:14:02.893 --> 02:14:05.956]  We worked with a bunch of sources there in Minnesota.
[02:14:07.338 --> 02:14:08.639]  Sometimes we recruited them.
[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:13.224]  One of them worked with me directly, obtained some of these tapes.
[02:14:13.704 --> 02:14:17.668]  But to repeat what I said earlier, they are now in fear for their life.
[02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:20.151]  We have security there with them.
[02:14:20.191 --> 02:14:22.994]  We're trying to raise money to pay for their hotels and lodging.
[02:14:23.758 --> 02:14:26.419]  Uh, this is a mob sort of situation.
[02:14:26.459 --> 02:14:27.899]  By the way, it takes money to fund a war.
[02:14:27.939 --> 02:14:29.080]  ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:29.860]  We're not playing games.
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:32.320]  James, come back as soon as the new video drops.
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:33.041]  I know you're busy.
[02:14:33.081 --> 02:14:34.021]  You can give us five minutes.
[02:14:34.341 --> 02:14:34.881]  We love you.
[02:14:35.181 --> 02:14:36.902]  We feel so good knowing you're out there on the field.
[02:14:37.202 --> 02:14:39.222]  As you said earlier, you have the footage coming out.
[02:14:39.542 --> 02:14:41.963]  When is the footage coming out of the money exchanging hands?
[02:14:43.083 --> 02:14:44.164]  Probably later tonight.
[02:14:44.564 --> 02:14:44.824]  Wow.
[02:14:45.104 --> 02:14:45.404]  Okay.
[02:14:46.064 --> 02:14:47.225]  James O'Keefe, we love you.
[02:14:47.265 --> 02:14:47.865]  We salute you.
[02:14:47.885 --> 02:14:48.645]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:14:49.514 --> 02:14:49.874]  Thank you.
[02:14:50.474 --> 02:14:51.555]  Wow.
[02:14:51.975 --> 02:14:54.316]  This is one of the best shows I've done in 26 years.
[02:14:54.876 --> 02:14:55.257]  Wow.
[02:14:56.137 --> 02:14:56.477]  Wow.
[02:14:56.957 --> 02:14:59.558]  Paul Joseph Watson, David Icke, James O'Keefe.
[02:14:59.739 --> 02:15:01.079]  Great crew out of the park.
[02:15:01.579 --> 02:15:03.120]  We've got coming up Gerald Cilente.
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:05.421]  This is what it's all about, man.
[02:15:05.681 --> 02:15:07.102]  We stayed on the air for this.
[02:15:07.482 --> 02:15:08.883]  We stayed on the air for the fight.
[02:15:09.143 --> 02:15:10.703]  And now we're here when it really counts.
[02:15:10.743 --> 02:15:11.964]  Thanks to you, listeners.
[02:15:12.324 --> 02:15:13.204]  I salute you.
[02:15:13.304 --> 02:15:14.185]  Man, you're amazing.
[02:15:15.097 --> 02:15:15.997]  Look at this headline.
[02:15:16.637 --> 02:15:20.919]  Boston shuts down Salt Bay luxury steakhouse over COVID violations.
[02:15:21.379 --> 02:15:22.479]  The Walmart stays open.
[02:15:23.079 --> 02:15:27.261]  Snitches report a restaurant not adhering to social distancing face mask guidelines.
[02:15:28.261 --> 02:15:29.081]  This is tyranny.
[02:15:29.982 --> 02:15:31.222]  Snitches get stitches.
[02:15:38.658 --> 02:15:45.183]  Finally, people are going to figure out that laying down makes you a slave and that it's got a higher cost of standing up.
[02:15:45.624 --> 02:15:52.189]  Gerald Cilente is about to take over right now.
[02:15:52.209 --> 02:15:54.831]  Really appreciate his great work.
[02:15:58.951 --> 02:16:02.834]  We're going to have live coverage tomorrow night of this incredible debate, and I'm going to be good.
[02:16:02.854 --> 02:16:07.919]  I'm going to behave myself, and I'm not going to talk except during applauses or pauses.
[02:16:08.099 --> 02:16:10.321]  I'm going to host the two hours of the debate.
[02:16:11.262 --> 02:16:14.084]  But before it and after it, we've got a bunch of guest hosts.
[02:16:14.124 --> 02:16:15.205]  We're going to take calls and more.
[02:16:16.266 --> 02:16:17.107]  But 5 p.m.
[02:16:17.147 --> 02:16:19.949]  tomorrow, we're going to start the coverage, 7 p.m.
[02:16:19.989 --> 02:16:21.551]  Central, the debate for 90 minutes.
[02:16:22.491 --> 02:16:23.732]  These things always start late.
[02:16:23.752 --> 02:16:25.054]  We're going to be covering it tomorrow.
[02:16:25.134 --> 02:16:26.395]  But what's fun about this is,
[02:16:28.285 --> 02:16:39.852]  You'll be able to send out those verboten links to Band.Video and InfoWars.com to the debate and say, here's the secret debate channel you're not supposed to promote.
[02:16:40.732 --> 02:16:47.576]  And we did this last time four years ago and had up to 3 million extra viewers than what we regularly have tuning in.
[02:16:48.637 --> 02:16:50.338]  So I'm very, very excited about all of that.
[02:16:51.518 --> 02:16:52.519]  So much more coming up.
[02:16:53.039 --> 02:16:54.020]  We're gonna go to Gerald Cilente.
[02:16:55.862 --> 02:16:58.583]  But I wanted to play this a short little clip before he takes over.
[02:17:01.023 --> 02:17:02.264]  Because it's very, very important.
[02:17:05.184 --> 02:17:06.445]  And it is clip five.
[02:17:07.025 --> 02:17:11.166]  CRT could lead humanity to annihilation.
[02:17:12.346 --> 02:17:14.967]  And then Gerald Celente is going to take over.
[02:17:15.007 --> 02:17:18.247]  And please remember, the only reason we're still on air is because of you.
[02:17:18.267 --> 02:17:19.968]  And when I say that, it's not patting you on the head.
[02:17:20.448 --> 02:17:24.409]  Your support, your word of mouth, your financial support is what keeps us on the air.
[02:17:25.762 --> 02:17:30.024]  And I just appreciate you all for keeping me in the fight because I always wanted to fight these tyrants.
[02:17:30.064 --> 02:17:35.045]  But now that I'm in the position of, if Biden wins, they're going to put my ass in prison or kill me.
[02:17:35.506 --> 02:17:36.386]  So now it's life and death.
[02:17:36.406 --> 02:17:38.827]  And I'm not even really kind of worried about that, except I don't want to lose.
[02:17:39.387 --> 02:17:41.248]  Like, I'm not worried about my life, but I'm worried about losing.
[02:17:41.668 --> 02:17:43.068]  I really want to beat these people.
[02:17:44.109 --> 02:17:46.290]  Not that Trump's even perfect, but you know what I mean.
[02:17:46.650 --> 02:17:49.871]  So Gerald Celente takes over in a few minutes, but here's this special report.
[02:17:50.951 --> 02:17:52.172]  What does CRT mean?
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:56.322]  CRT could lead to humanity, to annihilation.
[02:17:56.362 --> 02:18:05.388]  Here it is, then Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster, takes over, then Owen Schroer in the war room, and then, election countdown, 7 to 9 tonight.
[02:18:05.408 --> 02:18:05.829]  Stay with us.
[02:18:07.304 --> 02:18:10.425]  Black Lives Matter, 93% of the protests are peaceful.
[02:18:10.925 --> 02:18:13.246]  The vast, overwhelming majority are peaceful.
[02:18:13.706 --> 02:18:18.387]  And by the way, the 7% that are not, they have a very broad definition of what's not quote-unquote peaceful.
[02:18:18.407 --> 02:18:20.488]  For example, if you block traffic or something like that.
[02:18:20.728 --> 02:18:22.969]  Or if you respond to police provocation.
[02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:36.313]  And even then, a big percentage of that, that wasn't peaceful, is actually outside agitators, extremist right-wing agitators, posing as protesters in order to make the protests look bad.
[02:18:36.353 --> 02:18:36.933]  That's the first thing.
[02:18:37.265 --> 02:18:43.850]  After 26-year-old Lorenzo Johnson shot two police officers during protests in Louisville, Kentucky.
[02:18:44.250 --> 02:18:50.074]  He is charged with two counts of wanton endangerment and assault of a police officer.
[02:18:50.314 --> 02:18:54.117]  This in connection with the alleged shooting of two officers.
[02:18:54.437 --> 02:18:58.240]  Both of them suffered none life-threatening injuries.
[02:19:03.015 --> 02:19:05.957]  Johnson should have been staring down a murder charge.
[02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:19.584]  Instead, Johnson faces two counts of first-degree assault of a police officer and 14 counts of wanton endangerment of a police officer, according to the records from the Louisville Metropolitan Department of Corrections.
[02:19:19.744 --> 02:19:24.307]  The question is, why is Johnson being charged with assault and not attempted murder?
[02:19:24.984 --> 02:19:27.368]  The investigation is still early and ongoing.
[02:19:27.389 --> 02:19:31.636]  I would have to speak with our Public Integrity Unit investigators to determine that answer.
[02:19:31.696 --> 02:19:32.738]  I don't have that at this time.
[02:19:32.978 --> 02:19:36.825]  Not only does that herald sanctioned assault on police officers...
[02:19:41.007 --> 02:19:48.069]  That decision announces open season on anyone disagreeing with Biden's BLM brownshirt army.
[02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:49.290]  How did we get here?
[02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:52.831]  The creeping corrosion of critical race theory.
[02:19:53.291 --> 02:19:59.693]  Students in our universities are inundated with critical race theory.
[02:20:01.213 --> 02:20:02.814]  This is a Marxist doctrine.
[02:20:04.301 --> 02:20:07.544]  Holding that America is a wicked and racist nation.
[02:20:08.405 --> 02:20:11.689]  That even young children are complicit in oppression.
[02:20:12.930 --> 02:20:16.714]  And that our entire society must be radically transformed.
[02:20:17.366 --> 02:20:24.991]  We do workshops now with, in fact we're doing one later for faculty and staff and we'll probably offer these next year for students as well if they'd like to come.
[02:20:25.711 --> 02:20:27.792]  Is there a problem with the concept of I don't see color?
[02:20:27.812 --> 02:20:28.793]  You hear that a lot, Eugene.
[02:20:28.973 --> 02:20:29.614]  I don't see color.
[02:20:29.814 --> 02:20:30.434]  I don't see color.
[02:20:30.754 --> 02:20:31.895]  Cut people, they bleed red.
[02:20:32.575 --> 02:20:34.436]  We're all members of one race, the human race.
[02:20:35.457 --> 02:20:42.081]  And one of the perspectives that we've had for a number of years, I won't say we, I've had for a number of years, is when we do that, we disenfranchise people.
[02:20:42.642 --> 02:20:44.903]  Because you never hear anybody say, you know, I don't see gender.
[02:20:46.272 --> 02:20:57.537]  Let us be dissatisfied, and men will recognize that out of one blood God made all men to dwell upon the face of the earth.
[02:20:57.978 --> 02:21:11.304]  Let us be dissatisfied until that day when nobody will shout white power, when nobody will shout black power, but everybody will talk about God's power and human power.
[02:21:11.980 --> 02:21:17.946]  It's absolutely astonishing how critical race theory has pervaded every institution in the federal government.
[02:21:18.466 --> 02:21:28.236]  And what I've discovered is that critical race theory has become, in essence, the default ideology of the federal bureaucracy and is now being weaponized against the American people.
[02:21:28.836 --> 02:21:31.099]  Are you accusing the president of being a racist?
[02:21:32.661 --> 02:21:34.202]  I'm accusing him of being worse than that.
[02:21:34.982 --> 02:21:39.224]  He is somebody that is using race like a weapon to divide our country against itself.
[02:21:39.544 --> 02:21:41.044]  White supremacy is not a bad word.
[02:21:41.705 --> 02:21:42.965]  It's a mindset, right?
[02:21:42.985 --> 02:21:46.746]  I'm not walking around concerned about, you know, individuals in hoodies and burning crosses.
[02:21:46.766 --> 02:21:47.527]  They are who they are.
[02:21:47.547 --> 02:21:48.507]  I'm not concerned about them.
[02:21:49.608 --> 02:21:58.471]  It's the daily individuals that I'm around who ascribe to white supremacist thinking and don't know it.
[02:21:59.275 --> 02:22:00.155]  They're the most dangerous.
[02:22:00.856 --> 02:22:18.564]  Given that America is built on racism, sexism, and other evils, how will you as Vice President advocate, whether through policy or just through the powers that you know that you can advocate on, how will we resolve these injustices for the black community and specifically for black women?
[02:22:18.824 --> 02:22:22.186]  Yes, thank you, and thank you for your role of leadership.
[02:22:24.465 --> 02:22:30.130]  For many years now, the radicals have mistaken Americans' silence for weakness.
[02:22:31.131 --> 02:22:31.852]  But they're wrong.
[02:22:33.113 --> 02:22:36.736]  There is no more powerful force than a parent's love for their children.
[02:22:37.757 --> 02:22:47.306]  And patriotic moms and dads are going to demand that their children are no longer fed hateful lies about this country.
[02:22:48.647 --> 02:22:50.089]  American parents are not
[02:22:50.936 --> 02:23:05.874]  Going to accept indoctrination in our schools, cancel culture in our work, or the repression of traditional faith, culture, and values in the public square?
[02:23:06.996 --> 02:23:07.697]  Not anymore.
[02:23:08.376 --> 02:23:15.944]  Attacks on human beings for simply being white are stacking up all over the world, all in the name of critical race theory.
[02:23:16.264 --> 02:23:23.071]  Average people are being threatened by mobs of thugs while they enjoy dinner, all in the name of critical race theory.
[02:23:23.191 --> 02:23:29.297]  Western civilization is being dealt a final blow, all in the name of critical race theory.
[02:23:29.538 --> 02:23:30.759]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:23:43.541 --> 02:23:53.564]  So I would say, you know, if anything that's happening at CNN and anybody who buys your book, it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation.
[02:23:54.365 --> 02:23:56.405]  And I don't believe in dividing our nation.
[02:23:56.465 --> 02:23:57.666]  It hurts our great nation.
[02:23:58.426 --> 02:24:01.567]  And so CNN is really the enemy of the truth.
[02:24:01.927 --> 02:24:02.767]  And that's my opinion.
[02:24:03.108 --> 02:24:03.448]  Thank you.
[02:24:04.548 --> 02:24:06.989]  No American is an enemy of another American.
[02:24:07.329 --> 02:24:09.590]  No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[02:24:23.248 --> 02:24:26.490]  No news output is an enemy of America.
[02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:28.531]  No news output is an enemy of America.
[02:24:28.571 --> 02:24:29.612]  They came in peace.
[02:25:01.300 --> 02:25:03.645]  No news output is an enemy of America.
[02:25:03.886 --> 02:25:05.209]  Bill Gates wants you!
[02:25:05.389 --> 02:25:07.053]  Take the vaccine!
[02:25:10.299 --> 02:25:13.681]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:25:13.701 --> 02:25:14.862]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:25:14.882 --> 02:25:16.423]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:25:16.604 --> 02:25:17.985]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:25:18.085 --> 02:25:19.105]  I want them shut down.
[02:25:19.165 --> 02:25:20.066]  I want them silenced.
[02:25:20.126 --> 02:25:20.827]  I want them muted.
[02:25:20.847 --> 02:25:22.748]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:25:22.768 --> 02:25:23.709]  You kept us on air.
[02:25:23.829 --> 02:25:25.130]  We did the analysis first.
[02:25:25.390 --> 02:25:26.411]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:25:26.471 --> 02:25:28.292]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:25:28.552 --> 02:25:34.437]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:25:35.017 --> 02:25:36.098]  You need to stop right now.
[02:25:36.178 --> 02:25:37.260]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:39.762]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:25:39.883 --> 02:25:40.964]  It's not gonna happen.
[02:25:40.984 --> 02:25:42.666]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[02:25:43.086 --> 02:25:45.549]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[02:25:45.629 --> 02:25:47.271]  Save yourself, save the world.
[02:25:47.591 --> 02:25:48.452]  We're in this together.
[02:25:48.793 --> 02:25:49.954]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:25:50.194 --> 02:25:51.194]  Communism's up here.
[02:25:51.375 --> 02:25:54.336]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[02:25:54.736 --> 02:25:56.557]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:25:56.757 --> 02:25:58.337]  My children are right here!
[02:25:59.038 --> 02:26:00.778]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:26:00.978 --> 02:26:02.019]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:26:02.239 --> 02:26:03.159]  And I need prayer!
[02:26:03.299 --> 02:26:04.240]  And I need action!
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:06.201]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[02:26:06.921 --> 02:26:08.922]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[02:26:09.582 --> 02:26:10.322]  Hello, hello.
[02:26:10.722 --> 02:26:12.843]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:13.724 --> 02:26:19.226]  And I have to tell you that the clip that Alex just played, you know, it kind of hit me pretty hard.
[02:26:20.643 --> 02:26:22.284]  This is not a racist nation.
[02:26:23.645 --> 02:26:36.373]  Let's get this straight, everybody with a mind bigger than a, uh, let's see, a little Andy Cuomo brain, or a gruesome Newsom brain, or a witless Whitmere brain.
[02:26:37.894 --> 02:26:42.957]  Of course, you people have the brains because you're listening to InfoWars and watching it.
[02:26:45.038 --> 02:26:49.821]  A racist nation does not elect a black president.
[02:26:50.578 --> 02:26:50.998]  Got it?
[02:26:53.199 --> 02:26:54.239]  What was the guy's name?
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:59.121]  Oh, Barack the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner Obama?
[02:26:59.842 --> 02:27:00.262]  Folks!
[02:27:01.122 --> 02:27:01.562]  Folks!
[02:27:02.683 --> 02:27:05.824]  Yeah, he came in as a peace candidate.
[02:27:05.844 --> 02:27:08.265]  33,000 troop surge in Afghanistan.
[02:27:08.765 --> 02:27:11.386]  I want that guy Qaddafi out of there!
[02:27:12.046 --> 02:27:18.949]  I don't care if you destroy the richest nation in Africa, whose people had more rights than anybody else.
[02:27:20.922 --> 02:27:22.223]  Hey, a black guy did that?
[02:27:22.303 --> 02:27:23.864]  Why, you racist cilenti?
[02:27:24.245 --> 02:27:25.065]  Oh, no, no.
[02:27:25.546 --> 02:27:26.746]  No, Obama did it.
[02:27:27.447 --> 02:27:30.209]  Obama, a black man murderer.
[02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:32.811]  Oh, and I forgot the other black guy.
[02:27:33.632 --> 02:27:34.872]  You remember him?
[02:27:35.853 --> 02:27:37.494]  Colin Powell.
[02:27:38.295 --> 02:27:38.795]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:38.855 --> 02:27:41.998]  What was he, the defense secretary or something like that?
[02:27:42.778 --> 02:27:47.242]  Yeah, holding up his crap of Colin to tell Americans?
[02:27:48.143 --> 02:27:52.386]  That Osama Bin Laden had weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda?
[02:27:52.747 --> 02:27:54.188]  Hey, he was a black guy!
[02:27:54.208 --> 02:27:59.872]  Oh, and how about Condoleezza Rice, huh?
[02:28:00.793 --> 02:28:01.414]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:01.434 --> 02:28:09.200]  The next mushroom cloud you see selling us the Iraq War?
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:10.561]  Oh, she was black!
[02:28:12.623 --> 02:28:14.744]  How about Eric Holder, huh?
[02:28:15.085 --> 02:28:16.546]  Yeah, hold this, Eric!
[02:28:17.662 --> 02:28:18.943]  Oh, you know the guy?
[02:28:18.963 --> 02:28:25.007]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the guy that works at a White Shoe Boys.
[02:28:25.027 --> 02:28:27.249]  Yeah, they let him in the club.
[02:28:28.349 --> 02:28:30.131]  Too big to jail.
[02:28:30.151 --> 02:28:32.672]  Oh, you forgot?
[02:28:33.933 --> 02:28:40.998]  You forgot all the banksters that were convicted of fraud that Holder let go?
[02:28:41.018 --> 02:28:41.058]  Oh.
[02:28:42.554 --> 02:28:43.455]  What color was he?
[02:28:43.635 --> 02:28:43.935]  Black.
[02:28:44.195 --> 02:28:46.817]  Why you racist cilenti!
[02:28:47.358 --> 02:28:47.898]  Save it!
[02:28:49.799 --> 02:28:53.062]  No nation elects a black president.
[02:28:54.203 --> 02:28:55.584]  No nation that's racist.
[02:28:56.705 --> 02:29:00.848]  And by the way, I find it offensive as an Italian-American.
[02:29:01.768 --> 02:29:03.470]  No Italian-American presidents.
[02:29:04.110 --> 02:29:05.892]  No Italian-American vice presidents.
[02:29:07.553 --> 02:29:10.395]  No Italian-Americans all the way up those lines over there.
[02:29:11.149 --> 02:29:18.691]  Hey, could you imagine showing a black show like The Sopranos?
[02:29:19.871 --> 02:29:21.572]  Oh, yeah, sure!
[02:29:22.172 --> 02:29:23.112]  Any day!
[02:29:26.093 --> 02:29:28.074]  To me, those shows are a disgrace.
[02:29:29.594 --> 02:29:31.175]  Those aren't my kind of people.
[02:29:31.555 --> 02:29:36.436]  When I grew up, we didn't look up to the mafia or look down at them.
[02:29:37.290 --> 02:29:39.712]  But no, no, that's the way it is now.
[02:29:39.772 --> 02:29:40.713]  That's okay.
[02:29:41.013 --> 02:29:43.636]  How about doing a black mobster show?
[02:29:43.656 --> 02:29:45.477]  A De Niro!
[02:29:45.898 --> 02:29:48.020]  A De Niro of zero!
[02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:51.763]  Yeah, you're a little sellout for the Italians.
[02:29:52.384 --> 02:29:57.108]  How come you don't produce some black shows like you put down the Italians?
[02:29:57.548 --> 02:29:59.110]  Why, your money's not there?
[02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:01.272]  Or you don't have the cojones?
[02:30:02.643 --> 02:30:03.863]  I've had it with this.
[02:30:04.324 --> 02:30:07.745]  Don't call this a racist nation.
[02:30:07.845 --> 02:30:12.086]  As a matter of fact, that little cafon.
[02:30:12.526 --> 02:30:13.987]  Cafon de Niro!
[02:30:14.147 --> 02:30:15.907]  Hey, I'm not far from you over here.
[02:30:16.447 --> 02:30:17.388]  I'm in Woodstock.
[02:30:17.448 --> 02:30:19.308]  You're in Gardner over there.
[02:30:19.368 --> 02:30:20.028]  Not too far.
[02:30:20.048 --> 02:30:22.409]  I'm in Kingston, rather, by the way.
[02:30:22.449 --> 02:30:23.289]  Not Woodstock.
[02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:25.830]  You're not far from me in Gardner.
[02:30:26.250 --> 02:30:27.931]  I'll call you out on who you are.
[02:30:28.491 --> 02:30:31.372]  You're a lowlife sellout to the Italians.
[02:30:33.786 --> 02:30:36.368]  Can you imagine doing black movies like that?
[02:30:36.889 --> 02:30:45.016]  And I have to tell you, the whole democratic race, to me, is sexist and racist.
[02:30:46.818 --> 02:30:48.780]  Oh yeah, we're picking Kamala Harris.
[02:30:49.921 --> 02:30:51.242]  Yeah, her father was Jamaican.
[02:30:52.944 --> 02:30:54.085]  We get that black vote.
[02:30:54.225 --> 02:30:54.665]  A woman?
[02:30:56.047 --> 02:30:56.407]  Oh yeah.
[02:30:59.011 --> 02:31:01.192]  She should be taken off the ballot immediately.
[02:31:01.553 --> 02:31:04.134]  How about picking the best person for the job?
[02:31:05.615 --> 02:31:06.455]  I run a business.
[02:31:07.076 --> 02:31:13.139]  I could care if they're black, white, green, yellow, transgender, inside out, upside down.
[02:31:13.559 --> 02:31:15.481]  Give me the best person.
[02:31:18.062 --> 02:31:18.322]  No.
[02:31:19.703 --> 02:31:23.625]  It has to be right sex and right color.
[02:31:25.126 --> 02:31:28.188]  We just had a bit another protest up here March from
[02:31:28.607 --> 02:31:30.328]  Antifa and Black Lives Matter.
[02:31:31.509 --> 02:31:35.612]  You remember all the crap they gave me when I held the rally over here on the 4th of July?
[02:31:35.632 --> 02:31:36.933]  This is past Friday.
[02:31:37.394 --> 02:31:38.495]  They closed down the streets.
[02:31:38.515 --> 02:31:40.176]  They're marching up and down around the street.
[02:31:40.776 --> 02:31:57.249]  And getting to the corner over here where I have the most historic four... the most historic buildings on the four corners of America that I bought as a proud American because the seeds of democracy were sold here on the four corners of freedom which have been robbed from us.
[02:31:57.759 --> 02:31:59.539]  You know what they started chanting when they got to there?
[02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:01.300]  Gentrification!
[02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:02.300]  Gentrification!
[02:32:02.980 --> 02:32:04.641]  Black people used to live here.
[02:32:04.901 --> 02:32:05.661]  No they didn't!
[02:32:06.361 --> 02:32:08.522]  Black people never lived around this neighborhood.
[02:32:08.842 --> 02:32:10.962]  They lived a couple of neighborhoods down that way.
[02:32:10.982 --> 02:32:13.403]  The Dutch were here first.
[02:32:14.383 --> 02:32:16.764]  And it kind of stayed, you know, that kind of neighborhood.
[02:32:19.244 --> 02:32:20.205]  But they could do it.
[02:32:21.645 --> 02:32:25.786]  They could rally and protest all they want, but Gerald Cilenti
[02:32:27.361 --> 02:32:33.382]  Has a rally in Kingston, New York to celebrate the 4th of July and our freedom.
[02:32:34.583 --> 02:32:41.524]  And I invited Black Lives Matter to be here to speak at the event.
[02:32:42.725 --> 02:32:44.185]  But they didn't come.
[02:32:45.745 --> 02:32:46.666]  That's right.
[02:32:47.266 --> 02:32:51.727]  They wouldn't come because one reason why I'm on Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:52.887 --> 02:32:54.868]  And Judge Napolitano is on Fox.
[02:32:55.108 --> 02:32:56.128]  I'm not making that up.
[02:32:57.216 --> 02:33:03.398]  Black Lives Matter folks, you love those three strikes you're out at the Clintons and Biden.
[02:33:27.185 --> 02:33:28.365]  Push through, yeah.
[02:33:28.385 --> 02:33:34.406]  Yeah, you get busted for selling pot or smoking a three-time zap, you're in jail for the rest of your life.
[02:33:35.847 --> 02:33:36.247]  Yeah.
[02:33:36.647 --> 02:33:36.847]  Vote.
[02:33:36.867 --> 02:33:38.027]  Don't forget to vote for them.
[02:33:38.067 --> 02:33:38.967]  Don't forget to vote.
[02:33:40.748 --> 02:33:44.249]  Again, do De Niro.
[02:33:44.809 --> 02:33:46.169]  Arrogant De Niro.
[02:33:46.829 --> 02:33:48.389]  Do what you do to the Italians.
[02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.769]  Do it.
[02:33:49.710 --> 02:33:50.650]  Do it to the blacks.
[02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:52.190]  Let's see how far you go.
[02:33:52.970 --> 02:33:53.570]  Coward.
[02:33:54.151 --> 02:33:55.911]  You're all a bunch of cowards.
[02:33:56.846 --> 02:33:58.987]  It's okay to do it to the Italians!
[02:34:01.489 --> 02:34:02.230]  Not the blacks.
[02:34:03.771 --> 02:34:06.392]  Oh, you can't do it to the Jewish people either, you'd be an anti-Semite.
[02:34:07.933 --> 02:34:09.314]  It's okay to do it against us.
[02:34:12.817 --> 02:34:15.358]  Eh, how come they didn't pick an Italian-American to run against them?
[02:34:15.979 --> 02:34:24.124]  It's like that clown de Blasio going with his last name, Wilhelm, and going to the mother's name, the only quarter Italian, to get the Italian vote in New York.
[02:34:24.724 --> 02:34:25.685]  They use it when they need it.
[02:34:26.288 --> 02:34:27.188]  We're going to be right back.
[02:34:27.248 --> 02:34:27.909]  Stay tuned.
[02:34:28.229 --> 02:34:28.989]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:34:29.009 --> 02:34:31.370]  Put your money where your heart is.
[02:34:32.431 --> 02:34:34.952]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:35.792 --> 02:34:46.857]  And as Alex said, you know, it's, we have to do the work of God because there's, there's definitely a satanic spirit that's running and really ruining the world as I see it.
[02:34:47.517 --> 02:34:50.278]  And I consider myself a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[02:34:51.339 --> 02:34:53.299]  And people say, oh, Salenti, you raised your voice.
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:54.280]  Yeah, I raised my voice.
[02:34:55.535 --> 02:35:01.000]  Oh, and you said if somebody broke into your house and you'd blow their brains out?
[02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:01.680]  Yeah, I said that.
[02:35:01.700 --> 02:35:03.462]  What, am I supposed to let them kill me?
[02:35:04.062 --> 02:35:05.664]  Well, the Prince of Peace wouldn't do that.
[02:35:05.904 --> 02:35:06.384]  Wait a minute.
[02:35:07.205 --> 02:35:14.811]  Isn't this the person that picked up a whip to drive the money changers out of the temple and became violent?
[02:35:16.293 --> 02:35:17.754]  I'm supposed to let somebody take my life?
[02:35:17.774 --> 02:35:22.998]  And then what happened three days later, right?
[02:35:23.058 --> 02:35:23.679]  On the cross.
[02:35:26.391 --> 02:35:28.032]  We better fight for our freedom.
[02:35:28.332 --> 02:35:29.873]  This is like nothing I've ever seen.
[02:35:29.913 --> 02:35:31.253]  Nobody's ever seen anything like this.
[02:35:31.533 --> 02:35:31.854]  Nobody.
[02:35:33.094 --> 02:35:34.415]  It's a freak show in front of us.
[02:35:35.755 --> 02:35:39.697]  I mentioned you got this little clown of a nothing little boy who never worked a day in his life.
[02:35:40.598 --> 02:35:41.438]  De Blasio.
[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:46.381]  His name is Wilhelm.
[02:35:46.821 --> 02:35:47.581]  You look at the guy.
[02:35:47.601 --> 02:35:51.103]  He's like a quarter of Italian.
[02:35:51.123 --> 02:35:51.903]  His mother's name.
[02:35:57.398 --> 02:35:58.639]  They use it when they want it.
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:06.486]  How could anybody with a brain bigger than a pea take orders from this jerk or all of the others?
[02:36:07.727 --> 02:36:14.692]  Well, they do it the same way they hired Hitler, saluted Stalin, and marched off to Mussolini.
[02:36:15.693 --> 02:36:16.794]  Look at this little jerk.
[02:36:17.995 --> 02:36:18.375]  Look at him.
[02:36:19.597 --> 02:36:20.798]  A nothing of a boy.
[02:36:22.419 --> 02:36:23.700]  An arrogant nobody.
[02:36:24.727 --> 02:36:26.348]  Destroy New York City.
[02:36:27.208 --> 02:36:28.789]  New York is dead.
[02:36:29.749 --> 02:36:30.569]  It's dead.
[02:36:31.710 --> 02:36:33.850]  You go to Midtown, it's no town.
[02:36:35.811 --> 02:36:36.431]  There he is.
[02:36:37.672 --> 02:36:39.332]  Warren Wilhelm Jr.
[02:36:39.893 --> 02:36:41.733]  He's a real junior.
[02:36:42.334 --> 02:36:43.714]  Junior high school.
[02:36:44.174 --> 02:36:46.315]  And that's what we're still stuck in.
[02:36:47.195 --> 02:36:48.476]  We're in high school.
[02:36:51.437 --> 02:36:54.218]  The high school minds are running and ruining our lives.
[02:36:55.014 --> 02:37:02.439]  Look at these imbeciles that are principals and school administrators.
[02:37:03.859 --> 02:37:08.302]  What they're doing to kids going to school in Colorado, all over the place.
[02:37:09.043 --> 02:37:10.784]  Giving them all these tests.
[02:37:11.984 --> 02:37:13.065]  Can't go out and party!
[02:37:13.245 --> 02:37:15.146]  You're not going out and party!
[02:37:15.607 --> 02:37:21.390]  Holy... I gotta tell you, I grew up at the right time.
[02:37:24.361 --> 02:37:26.201]  Sex, drugs, and rock and roll.
[02:37:27.582 --> 02:37:29.062]  I smoked, but I didn't inhale.
[02:37:29.082 --> 02:37:34.543]  Can you imagine being such a lowlife to say something like, I smoked, but I didn't inhale?
[02:37:35.303 --> 02:37:38.604]  Yeah, you could if you're Slimey Slick Willy Clinton.
[02:37:39.224 --> 02:37:47.206]  Another murderer's SOB who should rot in hell right now for all the people he killed in Iraq.
[02:37:47.246 --> 02:37:48.946]  Hey, you like that Yugoslav war?
[02:37:48.986 --> 02:37:50.087]  Maybe that was your favorite.
[02:37:51.267 --> 02:37:51.447]  Yep.
[02:37:54.611 --> 02:38:07.936]  You remember Madeleine Albright, or not all that bright, telling Leslie Stahl that the sanctions that Bill Clinton put on Iraq that killed over 500,000 Iraqi children, the price was worth it?
[02:38:07.956 --> 02:38:10.816]  It was worth it.
[02:38:11.897 --> 02:38:19.659]  By the way, I was the keynote speaker on the QE2 one time, and she was the lead-off speaker.
[02:38:19.679 --> 02:38:20.500]  Funny story.
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:24.141]  I mean, she was the queen of tarts, man.
[02:38:24.824 --> 02:38:26.025]  This big thing in red.
[02:38:27.565 --> 02:38:29.446]  They gave her a 15-minute introduction.
[02:38:30.626 --> 02:38:33.448]  Born in Czechoslovakia, which is now the Czech Republic.
[02:38:33.748 --> 02:38:44.692]  Her father was this, her mother was that, her grandfather was that, her grandfather was this, went to this school, went to that school, went to that school, went to this school, this school, honors and this, honors and that, honors and this, went on and on and on.
[02:38:45.393 --> 02:38:48.354]  Nothing more than the same crap that you hear all the time.
[02:38:49.374 --> 02:38:50.475]  Anyway, I was the next day.
[02:38:52.463 --> 02:38:53.483]  And they introduced me.
[02:38:53.703 --> 02:38:57.044]  This is Gerald Cilenti.
[02:38:57.984 --> 02:39:02.445]  These are vice presidents of marketing for the biggest corporations in the world.
[02:39:04.145 --> 02:39:13.307]  And, you know, Gerald Cilenti, the author of Trends 2000, Far Better Than Megatrends, his book Trend Tracking, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, Trends Journal Magazine.
[02:39:14.207 --> 02:39:18.808]  So the guy, after he gives me a couple of minute introduction, I said to him, thank you very much for that introduction.
[02:39:19.588 --> 02:39:21.108]  I said, I feel shortchanged.
[02:39:22.108 --> 02:39:29.832]  I said, after hearing Madeleine Albright's introduction last night, the crowd broke up laughing because it was such a joke.
[02:39:32.233 --> 02:39:39.937]  And I said to him, what you forgot to mention is that I graduated without honors from PS 76 in the Bronx.
[02:39:40.777 --> 02:39:42.598]  You know, so I had I had them in my hand.
[02:39:43.059 --> 02:39:44.739]  But that's the people we're dealing with.
[02:39:46.380 --> 02:39:51.683]  And it's the same sick principals, the same sick administrators,
[02:39:52.383 --> 02:39:58.447]  That is sucking the joy out of young people's lives by not letting them go out and party.
[02:39:58.687 --> 02:39:59.708]  Oh, yeah, we're going out.
[02:39:59.768 --> 02:40:00.328]  We're going out.
[02:40:00.408 --> 02:40:01.969]  I mean, save it, man.
[02:40:01.989 --> 02:40:03.850]  You're not going out.
[02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:05.151]  You can't go to bars.
[02:40:05.171 --> 02:40:06.452]  You can't go dancing.
[02:40:06.752 --> 02:40:08.313]  You can't go out and have a good time.
[02:40:08.834 --> 02:40:13.356]  These are the same sick people, these arrogant, a principal.
[02:40:13.677 --> 02:40:15.158]  I need a principal as a kid?
[02:40:15.338 --> 02:40:18.039]  What the hell do I need a principal for when I have a mother and father?
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:20.401]  I don't need a principal over me.
[02:40:20.821 --> 02:40:21.642]  Yes, you do.
[02:40:22.603 --> 02:40:24.324]  In the new land of Slavelandia.
[02:40:25.344 --> 02:40:27.184]  So they break up these house parties.
[02:40:27.645 --> 02:40:28.565]  It's a big deal.
[02:40:29.345 --> 02:40:36.707]  But it's okay to have Black Lives Matter marching up and down the streets with Antifa over here.
[02:40:38.308 --> 02:40:39.088]  That's okay.
[02:40:40.169 --> 02:40:50.672]  These are the same principals and brilliant school administrators that had us hiding under desks
[02:40:51.826 --> 02:40:56.150]  When I was a kid growing up, in case an atom bomb went off.
[02:40:57.210 --> 02:41:01.434]  Like, going under a desk is gonna make that much difference.
[02:41:02.835 --> 02:41:03.716]  No difference!
[02:41:04.796 --> 02:41:11.702]  You know, we got too big to go under the desk, they put us out in the hallway with our hands behind our head up against the wall, and they'd say, if you see a flash, don't look at it.
[02:41:12.202 --> 02:41:15.905]  If I see a flash, don't look at it, I'll be dead before I can blink my eye.
[02:41:15.925 --> 02:41:20.409]  There you got it, another Anthony Frieda work of art.
[02:41:20.489 --> 02:41:21.450]  What a genius he is.
[02:41:22.028 --> 02:41:25.150]  Yeah, that's what they had us, and they have us doing the same thing now.
[02:41:25.991 --> 02:41:26.291]  Fear.
[02:41:26.751 --> 02:41:29.373]  That's all the Cartoon Network did this today.
[02:41:31.234 --> 02:41:37.578]  Fear, fear, fear, mask, wear the mask, wear the mask, wear the mask, forget the facts, forget the facts, forget the facts.
[02:41:37.939 --> 02:41:41.801]  Hey, nobody mentions that they don't wear masks in the Nordic countries.
[02:41:42.782 --> 02:41:43.903]  Emasculation.
[02:41:44.883 --> 02:41:45.464]  We got it.
[02:41:49.066 --> 02:41:50.267]  That's all it's become.
[02:41:51.411 --> 02:41:54.092]  Oh, they're not wearing in those other countries, why do we have to wear them here?
[02:41:55.072 --> 02:42:07.116]  Oh, and you know, I mean, you know from watching InfoWars, that the CDC, the World Health Organization, even that fraud Fauci, jaw, Fauci, it's an Italian, jaw, jaw boner.
[02:42:07.976 --> 02:42:10.377]  They all said, masks don't, they don't work.
[02:42:10.737 --> 02:42:13.018]  These masks, they don't, if you're sick, wear one.
[02:42:13.438 --> 02:42:15.918]  But if you're not, they're not gonna help you.
[02:42:16.799 --> 02:42:18.139]  But yet everybody believes it.
[02:42:18.619 --> 02:42:21.060]  I see people driving in cars, and you do too,
[02:42:21.769 --> 02:42:23.510]  With masks on and the windows rolled up.
[02:42:27.473 --> 02:42:28.654]  I'll tell you the hypocrisy.
[02:42:28.694 --> 02:42:29.875]  I'm up here near Woodstock.
[02:42:30.976 --> 02:42:31.916]  I used to be on this show.
[02:42:31.936 --> 02:42:33.257]  They won't allow me on anymore.
[02:42:34.218 --> 02:42:34.718]  You know why?
[02:42:35.739 --> 02:42:42.264]  Because a while ago, I got really angry about the dictator over here, Cuomo, robbing us of our rights.
[02:42:42.284 --> 02:42:43.785]  They said, this is like Nazi Germany.
[02:42:45.866 --> 02:42:47.027]  It's terrible what they're doing.
[02:42:47.828 --> 02:42:49.249]  These are the Nazis in charge.
[02:42:49.269 --> 02:42:50.850]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution,
[02:42:51.505 --> 02:42:53.866]  How dare I say Nazis?
[02:42:55.207 --> 02:43:06.453]  All the Jewish people around the area, not all of them, but that big part up there in Woodstock and the liberals, attacked me for comparing Cuomo to a Nazi.
[02:43:06.713 --> 02:43:08.654]  How could I be so insensitive?
[02:43:09.955 --> 02:43:11.435]  Hey, but wait a minute.
[02:43:12.236 --> 02:43:14.917]  Biden came out and compared Trump to a Nazi.
[02:43:16.818 --> 02:43:17.819]  That's okay.
[02:43:18.979 --> 02:43:19.920]  That's okay.
[02:43:21.576 --> 02:43:22.076]  All right?
[02:43:23.597 --> 02:43:24.677]  That's what's going on.
[02:43:25.957 --> 02:43:35.980]  Celenti attacked for calling Cuomo a Nazi, for robbing me of my rights to be a free man in America.
[02:43:39.061 --> 02:43:40.261]  How can I do that?
[02:43:40.341 --> 02:43:42.282]  It's a disgrace to the Jewish people.
[02:43:44.222 --> 02:43:46.123]  But it's okay for Biden to do it.
[02:43:46.883 --> 02:43:54.546]  Because all those liberals love them, and they're not liberals, they're communist scum!
[02:43:55.327 --> 02:43:57.348]  As I see it, we'll be back.
[02:43:58.568 --> 02:44:00.869]  Hey, great being back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:00.909 --> 02:44:04.411]  You know, you really, we're in a fight for our lives.
[02:44:04.511 --> 02:44:11.734]  I mean, I have to tell you, and I mean this, just sometimes I'm feeling, you know, if I was dead, it's okay.
[02:44:11.754 --> 02:44:14.055]  Because this isn't the kind of life I want to live.
[02:44:15.290 --> 02:44:16.891]  I don't want to go around masked up.
[02:44:17.112 --> 02:44:21.095]  I don't want people going after me, you know, giving me dirty looks.
[02:44:21.235 --> 02:44:22.536]  I can't tell if they're giving me dirty looks.
[02:44:22.576 --> 02:44:23.236]  I got a mask on.
[02:44:23.256 --> 02:44:24.878]  They'd cross the street if I don't have one.
[02:44:25.919 --> 02:44:30.723]  You're not going able to do anything that you like to do because they won't allow it.
[02:44:30.803 --> 02:44:32.244]  This isn't a life for me.
[02:44:32.304 --> 02:44:36.307]  So we have to unite and you have to keep the truth alive.
[02:44:36.367 --> 02:44:38.509]  So you have to support Infowars.
[02:44:38.529 --> 02:44:42.272]  When I say you have to, I mean, you have to if you want to
[02:44:42.918 --> 02:44:49.921]  Have any semblance of freedom of speech to live in love and restore beauty and joy.

[02:46:49.452 --> 02:46:50.473]  One thing after another.
[02:46:50.593 --> 02:46:58.980]  You know, even in the Trends Journal, we have Brad Steiner doing survivalism for us, you know, close combat and other ways of survival.
[02:46:59.881 --> 02:47:02.303]  And I'm a close combat practitioner.
[02:47:03.024 --> 02:47:05.066]  That's why I speak out the way I feel.
[02:47:05.306 --> 02:47:06.587]  I'm not afraid of anybody.
[02:47:07.441 --> 02:47:10.482]  As I said, little Andy Cuomo, you come over here and tell me to put a mask on.
[02:47:10.522 --> 02:47:11.822]  No, leave your goons behind you.
[02:47:12.302 --> 02:47:13.763]  And you come over here and put a mask on me.
[02:47:14.083 --> 02:47:14.743]  Man to man.
[02:47:15.063 --> 02:47:15.363]  Got it?
[02:47:16.103 --> 02:47:17.024]  You too, de Blasio.
[02:47:17.044 --> 02:47:17.444]  Come over here.
[02:47:17.944 --> 02:47:18.704]  Put a mask on me.
[02:47:19.544 --> 02:47:19.824]  Go on.
[02:47:20.125 --> 02:47:21.425]  You, put a mask on me.
[02:47:22.765 --> 02:47:23.385]  Any one of you.
[02:47:24.406 --> 02:47:26.086]  Hey, how about that little... Ha!
[02:47:26.426 --> 02:47:27.066]  What a name.
[02:47:27.567 --> 02:47:29.727]  You want to call about an oxymoron?
[02:47:30.347 --> 02:47:31.568]  Or a real moron?
[02:47:32.008 --> 02:47:34.949]  That guy who's the place governor of Pennsylvania?
[02:47:34.989 --> 02:47:35.469]  What is it?
[02:47:35.589 --> 02:47:35.849]  Wolf?
[02:47:36.718 --> 02:47:37.939]  You look at this guy.
[02:47:38.759 --> 02:47:40.040]  How about wolf?
[02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:41.181]  How about sheep?
[02:47:42.201 --> 02:47:43.022]  How about nothing?
[02:47:43.962 --> 02:47:46.264]  Could this guy face you man to man?
[02:47:47.625 --> 02:47:51.747]  So when you look at those survival products, this is a time for survival.
[02:47:53.368 --> 02:47:58.691]  And when you see these masks on, by the way, the next cover of the Trends Journal is coming out tomorrow.
[02:47:58.771 --> 02:47:59.472]  It's a weekly.
[02:48:00.112 --> 02:48:01.173]  It's going to be this.
[02:48:01.253 --> 02:48:04.695]  The presidential reality show is going to be masks versus no masks.
[02:48:05.831 --> 02:48:07.612]  That's what this election is going to be all about.
[02:48:07.632 --> 02:48:11.175]  And as Alex said, two things.
[02:48:11.776 --> 02:48:17.961]  He said how brutal it was for the police to beat up those people in Trafalgar Square fighting for their freedom.
[02:48:19.001 --> 02:48:21.363]  And he also said this is worse than the Iron Curtain.
[02:48:23.845 --> 02:48:26.988]  And I don't know his exact words, but he referenced China.
[02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:30.871]  And he's 100% right.
[02:48:33.072 --> 02:48:35.054]  It's Communist China.
[02:48:37.895 --> 02:48:43.136]  Here's the way I see the whole COVID war.
[02:48:43.857 --> 02:48:44.837]  It was launched by China.
[02:48:45.977 --> 02:48:54.380]  Go back, it happened on, you can't make this up, Lunar New Year 2020, Chinese Lunar New Year.
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:56.140]  That's when we got the scare.
[02:48:57.420 --> 02:48:58.321]  Middle of January.
[02:48:59.981 --> 02:49:01.942]  They're showing you all these pictures.
[02:49:02.582 --> 02:49:05.103]  They're building these hospitals within weeks.
[02:49:05.923 --> 02:49:06.763]  People dying.
[02:49:08.001 --> 02:49:08.241]  Right?
[02:49:12.045 --> 02:49:15.488]  China couldn't stop the Hong Kong protests.
[02:49:16.769 --> 02:49:28.419]  No matter what they were doing, we were writing about it week after week from June 2019 up until the COVID war broke out in the Yuan province.
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:30.942]  Who ever heard of a Yuan province?
[02:49:30.982 --> 02:49:33.324]  Not you, not me, but we all did.
[02:49:35.270 --> 02:49:38.872]  And what was the cover of our January 28th Trends Journal?
[02:49:40.013 --> 02:49:40.933]  Coronavirus.
[02:49:42.494 --> 02:49:47.277]  106 dead in China.
[02:49:47.297 --> 02:49:49.038]  1.4 billion still alive.
[02:49:49.938 --> 02:49:50.739]  New Black Plague.
[02:49:51.579 --> 02:49:53.200]  What are you telling me?
[02:49:53.220 --> 02:49:56.342]  106 people died in this filthy, dirty country.
[02:49:56.622 --> 02:49:58.143]  That's why people wear masks.
[02:49:58.483 --> 02:50:04.026]  To think, to think, to think that we would ever become like the Chinese
[02:50:05.336 --> 02:50:05.556]  Boom!
[02:50:05.876 --> 02:50:06.337]  Like that.
[02:50:07.217 --> 02:50:12.080]  The Chinese way is taken over.
[02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:12.780]  106 people.
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:14.962]  Oh, look at the world, Amita.
[02:50:16.222 --> 02:50:18.784]  Again, China's lying about the numbers.
[02:50:18.884 --> 02:50:20.245]  Fine, they're lying about the numbers.
[02:50:20.265 --> 02:50:21.866]  Their entire country's opened up.
[02:50:22.206 --> 02:50:25.308]  Their economy's going way up compared to other countries.
[02:50:26.809 --> 02:50:29.791]  They're gonna have positive growth while most other countries are negative growth.
[02:50:31.171 --> 02:50:33.753]  People are traveling all over China.
[02:50:34.670 --> 02:50:36.231]  Because they're not allowing them to go out.
[02:50:36.751 --> 02:50:40.233]  So the tourism industry is flourishing as it's dead over here.
[02:50:42.115 --> 02:50:44.196]  Retail sales, exports have gone up.
[02:50:47.358 --> 02:50:49.039]  No more protests in Hong Kong.
[02:50:49.119 --> 02:50:49.579]  It's over.
[02:50:49.599 --> 02:50:52.101]  They passed that national security law in January.
[02:50:53.822 --> 02:50:55.823]  Right after they hit us with the coronavirus.
[02:50:57.404 --> 02:50:58.284]  And now it's all stopped.
[02:50:59.865 --> 02:51:00.446]  They used it.
[02:51:02.187 --> 02:51:02.767]  They used it.
[02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:07.663]  They used the COVID war to stop the Chinese protests.
[02:51:08.543 --> 02:51:13.447]  And then all these other low-life politicians used it to gain authority.
[02:51:15.168 --> 02:51:17.270]  Again, they never talk about Sweden.
[02:51:18.971 --> 02:51:24.375]  Oh, don't tell me that their death rate from the virus is higher than other Nordic countries.
[02:51:25.096 --> 02:51:25.696]  Yes, it is.
[02:51:25.756 --> 02:51:29.639]  It's lower than most other countries.
[02:51:31.801 --> 02:51:33.282]  And they didn't lock down anything.
[02:51:34.520 --> 02:51:39.042]  And the Nordic nations, they're not walking around with masks on, but you never see that in the media here.
[02:51:41.323 --> 02:51:43.464]  The Chinese way, you will obey.
[02:51:44.784 --> 02:51:47.586]  Alex is 100% correct.
[02:51:49.667 --> 02:51:53.188]  We are living under the Chinese model of dictatorship.
[02:51:55.629 --> 02:51:57.270]  It's right in front of our eyes.
[02:51:58.550 --> 02:51:59.991]  I'm telling you, I am so sad.
[02:52:01.149 --> 02:52:02.630]  I used to love listening to music.
[02:52:02.650 --> 02:52:05.551]  I have thousands of hours of tapes, those cassette tapes.
[02:52:06.132 --> 02:52:07.172]  The great jazz.
[02:52:07.852 --> 02:52:09.793]  Oh, when black lives, to me, really mattered.
[02:52:11.494 --> 02:52:12.535]  Count Basie.
[02:52:13.535 --> 02:52:14.716]  Duke Ellington.
[02:52:15.516 --> 02:52:16.857]  Look at these cats!
[02:52:17.357 --> 02:52:18.698]  Count and Duke.
[02:52:19.738 --> 02:52:20.179]  Yeah.
[02:52:21.499 --> 02:52:22.960]  Real, real men.
[02:52:23.881 --> 02:52:28.623]  Gave us America's greatest export.
[02:52:30.118 --> 02:52:32.460]  Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong.
[02:52:33.962 --> 02:52:34.322]  Yeah.
[02:52:35.583 --> 02:52:38.245]  James Brown, the godfather of soul.
[02:52:40.707 --> 02:52:41.768]  Look what they gave us.
[02:52:44.170 --> 02:52:46.833]  And those young guys used to look up to the Black Cats.
[02:52:48.814 --> 02:52:49.375]  It's gone.
[02:52:50.796 --> 02:52:52.498]  You tell me about your rap, save it.
[02:52:53.098 --> 02:52:54.199]  Don't want to hear it.
[02:52:54.499 --> 02:52:55.340]  Got my own.
[02:52:56.041 --> 02:52:56.401]  Got it?
[02:52:57.481 --> 02:53:02.224]  The music that they were creating back then was American classical music.
[02:53:02.284 --> 02:53:03.785]  It was our greatest export.
[02:53:04.085 --> 02:53:05.526]  The whole world loved it.
[02:53:06.586 --> 02:53:07.587]  Was there racism?
[02:53:07.627 --> 02:53:08.548]  Of course there was.
[02:53:09.568 --> 02:53:11.169]  Sexism happens all the time.
[02:53:12.510 --> 02:53:13.571]  But look at these guys.
[02:53:14.031 --> 02:53:14.491]  Look at them!
[02:53:14.591 --> 02:53:15.192]  Look at them!
[02:53:15.332 --> 02:53:16.232]  Look at them!
[02:53:17.333 --> 02:53:18.133]  Look at them!
[02:53:19.514 --> 02:53:20.395]  Beaten down.
[02:53:21.235 --> 02:53:22.056]  Standing up.
[02:53:23.376 --> 02:53:24.497]  One after another.
[02:53:24.997 --> 02:53:26.058]  Cab Calloway.
[02:53:27.412 --> 02:53:28.413]  Ella Fitzgerald.
[02:53:28.873 --> 02:53:32.236]  Man, when I used to work for a trade association, I was the number two guy.
[02:53:32.717 --> 02:53:40.303]  Put on a concert with Ella Fitzgerald, went backstage, said my former wife, may she rest in peace, reminded her of God, Lord of Carmen.
[02:53:41.184 --> 02:53:42.325]  That's my America.
[02:53:42.345 --> 02:53:47.529]  And my America has been stolen from us, and we have to fight for our freedom.
[02:53:48.610 --> 02:53:50.631]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:53:50.672 --> 02:53:54.675]  If we don't unite and fight for liberty, love, joy, and beauty, we're dead.
[02:53:55.612 --> 02:53:56.172]  We're gone.
[02:53:56.232 --> 02:53:57.693]  I don't want to live in this kind of world.
[02:53:58.493 --> 02:54:00.554]  And do what you can to support the Trends Journal.
[02:54:00.574 --> 02:54:02.274]  There's no other magazine like it in the world.
[02:54:02.714 --> 02:54:08.056]  If you want to know what's going on, what it means and what's next, put your money where your heart is, in your mind.
[02:54:08.576 --> 02:54:09.917]  Support us in any way you can.
[02:54:09.937 --> 02:54:13.298]  And remember, go to InfoWars.
[02:54:13.878 --> 02:54:14.738]  Keep the truth alive.
[02:54:35.657 --> 02:54:36.798]  You can feel it.
[02:54:36.818 --> 02:54:37.599]  You can see it.
[02:54:37.639 --> 02:54:38.239]  You can taste it.
[02:54:38.259 --> 02:54:39.040]  You can smell it.
[02:54:39.060 --> 02:54:40.381]  You can touch it.
[02:54:40.421 --> 02:54:41.583]  And deep in my spirit,
[02:54:54.639 --> 02:55:00.384]  I've got a fiery tingle up and down my spine that goes into my jaw and into my eyes.
[02:55:00.945 --> 02:55:17.780]  I'm on fire right now because I know in the next 40 days of this election and the insanity and the globalist nuclear meltdown that we're going to see when Trump wins, that everything you do and everything I do is going to affect the future of the world for good or for bad.
[02:55:18.729 --> 02:55:24.371]  The globalists have made a very dangerous authoritarian move with all this massive censorship and surveillance.
[02:55:24.991 --> 02:55:26.012]  Just think about censorship.
[02:55:26.072 --> 02:55:29.513]  It takes surveillance of what you're doing and saying to have that censorship.
[02:55:30.093 --> 02:55:31.914]  They've had this massive AI move.
[02:55:31.934 --> 02:55:36.256]  They've had their street bullies out shooting cops and burning down buildings and setting up checkpoints.
[02:55:36.636 --> 02:55:39.097]  They have really launched authoritarian takeover.
[02:55:39.895 --> 02:55:43.297]  And it's because they're losing the hearts and minds, not just here, but worldwide.
[02:55:43.598 --> 02:55:46.640]  And they know that the tide is turning against them.
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:49.341]  So they're throwing everything they've got at us right now.
[02:55:49.882 --> 02:56:00.209]  But if we let them normalize all of this tyranny and their COVID power grab and their free speech annihilations and all their physical attacks, then we will go under their tyranny and they would have broken our will.
[02:56:00.989 --> 02:56:02.270]  And then things are going to get a lot worse.
[02:56:03.051 --> 02:56:08.074]  The new world order is on record that if they're able to defeat Trump, Bolsonaro and others around the world that are patriots,
[02:56:08.325 --> 02:56:17.551]  If they're able to successfully and effectively silence you and I, that they're going to move to a level very, very quick of unthinkable oppression and total control.
[02:56:18.232 --> 02:56:25.457]  That's why they're admitting that the new forced inoculations coming next year will actually maim and kill a lot of people because Bill Gates knows he can't hide it.
[02:56:25.937 --> 02:56:33.883]  That's why Trump is taking control of the process, saying he's going to have an early vaccine from a company that doesn't make one that is so dangerous or that doesn't change our DNA.
[02:56:34.123 --> 02:56:36.725]  And I'm not even endorsing what Trump's doing, but I understand what he's doing.
[02:56:37.375 --> 02:56:40.342]  So, things have been critical for 20 plus years that I've been on air.
[02:56:40.362 --> 02:56:41.324]  They were critical before that.
[02:56:41.705 --> 02:56:46.817]  But they're all building, building, building, building towards this moment now and what is going to happen in the future.
[02:56:47.563 --> 02:56:55.588]  And so the way we respond to this now, and the way we take action to this now, is like a game of pool when you first break the balls.
[02:56:56.148 --> 02:57:01.491]  It's going to dictate so much of the coming game how we carry this out right now.
[02:57:01.791 --> 02:57:04.293]  So ladies and gentlemen, pray to God for a global awakening.
[02:57:04.753 --> 02:57:12.838]  Pray to God to give you discernment, and lead God and direct you to know how to fight the enemy politically, spiritually, culturally, financially, and physically if they attack you to defend yourself.
[02:57:13.358 --> 02:57:16.100]  And realize that InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear.
[02:57:16.929 --> 02:57:20.530]  And it's only benefit must bear because of your support, your prayer.
[02:57:20.910 --> 02:57:26.511]  So please remember to support m4wrestore.com today because without you, we will not be able to continue to operate.
[02:57:26.711 --> 02:57:38.594]  And I'm firing the bat signal and saying now is the time that your support is so critical because over the years, the censorship, the lawsuits, the attacks, the enemy has really gotten us squeezed down to a point that I didn't want to ever get to.
[02:57:38.794 --> 02:57:39.934]  But I'm being honest with you now.
[02:57:40.154 --> 02:57:41.434]  We're seeing a lot of folks come through.
[02:57:41.675 --> 02:57:43.375]  We're seeing orders massively increase.
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:46.942]  But with everything going on, it's still not enough.
[02:57:47.002 --> 02:57:48.723]  So get products you already need.
[02:57:48.763 --> 02:57:49.964]  Get high-quality, storable food.
[02:57:50.004 --> 02:57:59.472]  Get books, films, supplements that are so good for your body, so good for your immune system, and know that you are funding an operation that is challenging the globalists effectively on a massive scale.
[02:58:00.172 --> 02:58:01.433]  Thank you so much for all you've done.
[02:58:01.473 --> 02:58:09.500]  I salute you, and I ask you to now count the cost, look at the historical juncture point we're at, and to make the right decision at this fork in the road.
[02:58:09.880 --> 02:58:13.323]  I'm Alex Jones, and if you're watching this, never forget, you are the resistance.
[02:58:26.169 --> 02:58:29.570]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:58:29.590 --> 02:58:30.730]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:58:30.750 --> 02:58:32.310]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:58:32.490 --> 02:58:33.850]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:58:33.970 --> 02:58:34.990]  I want them shut down.
[02:58:35.050 --> 02:58:35.951]  I want them silenced.
[02:58:36.011 --> 02:58:36.691]  I want them muted.
[02:58:36.731 --> 02:58:38.631]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:58:38.651 --> 02:58:39.591]  You kept us on air.
[02:58:39.711 --> 02:58:41.012]  We did the analysis first.
[02:58:41.292 --> 02:58:42.292]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:58:42.352 --> 02:58:44.152]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:58:44.432 --> 02:58:50.373]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:58:50.553 --> 02:58:51.993]  And you need to stop right now.
[02:58:52.093 --> 02:58:53.154]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:58:53.314 --> 02:58:55.674]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:58:55.794 --> 02:58:56.835]  This is not going to happen.
[02:58:56.855 --> 02:58:58.536]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[02:58:58.976 --> 02:59:00.097]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[02:59:00.537 --> 02:59:01.418]  Rescue InfoWars.
[02:59:01.518 --> 02:59:02.158]  Save yourself.
[02:59:02.519 --> 02:59:03.159]  Save the world.
[02:59:03.479 --> 02:59:04.340]  We're in this together.
[02:59:04.580 --> 02:59:06.081]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:59:06.101 --> 02:59:07.082]  Communism's up here.
[02:59:07.282 --> 02:59:10.244]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[02:59:10.624 --> 02:59:12.445]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:59:12.666 --> 02:59:14.147]  My children are right here!
[02:59:14.927 --> 02:59:16.668]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:59:16.868 --> 02:59:17.928]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:59:18.128 --> 02:59:19.049]  And I need prayer!
[02:59:19.189 --> 02:59:20.129]  And I need action!
[02:59:20.509 --> 02:59:22.110]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[02:59:22.830 --> 02:59:24.771]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[02:59:29.878 --> 02:59:35.644]  And I want to just salute Keith Bessemer and the folks at MyPatriotSupply because they've been a sponsor for 13 years.
[02:59:36.144 --> 02:59:37.305]  They've been around 14 years.
[02:59:37.826 --> 02:59:40.248]  They immediately bought up some of the bigger, better companies.
[02:59:40.469 --> 02:59:41.950]  We immediately got good feedback.
[02:59:42.531 --> 02:59:43.852]  I didn't want a bunch of food sponsors.
[02:59:43.892 --> 02:59:45.113]  I wanted one good one I could trust.
[02:59:45.153 --> 02:59:45.534]  I got them.
[02:59:46.134 --> 02:59:49.137]  And so we sell their whole food line and force where I come.
[02:59:50.680 --> 03:00:04.792]  Because of the Communist Chinese attacks on our servers, and where you've got to put in a little code to prove you're a human to get in, and the rest of it, just decimating the amount of folks that get into InfoWarsaw.com to buy the books, the films, the water filtration, the supplements.
[03:00:06.053 --> 03:00:08.595]  I called them a few weeks ago, and I said, look, we're under this attack.
[03:00:09.115 --> 03:00:12.858]  Can you just set up a URL for us, and then we get a percentage of the sales we get?
[03:00:12.878 --> 03:00:16.041]  Because I've got to move in to just not even having our websites anymore.
[03:00:16.061 --> 03:00:17.562]  I mean, we're under this level of attack.
[03:00:19.522 --> 03:00:21.602]  They weren't sure they could even do it in a month.
[03:00:21.762 --> 03:00:22.242]  Boom!
[03:00:22.943 --> 03:00:25.563]  And Keith Bessemer, the president of MyPatreon, goes, oh, no, no.
[03:00:26.143 --> 03:00:27.223]  We got it done for you.
[03:00:28.424 --> 03:00:34.585]  And so a discount on top of everything at a special URL that leads you to a special page.
[03:00:35.505 --> 03:00:38.845]  $170 discount on something that's already the best price you're going to find.
[03:00:38.865 --> 03:00:40.926]  So again, Keith, you've got the floor here.
[03:00:40.966 --> 03:00:42.866]  Tell folks about the special that's running right now.
[03:00:42.906 --> 03:00:46.787]  This is unprecedented because you guys already have the lowest price for the quality of food you've got.
[03:00:46.827 --> 03:00:47.687]  That's well known in the industry.
[03:00:48.007 --> 03:00:51.870]  So the three things are the air, the food, and the water.
[03:00:52.571 --> 03:01:00.758]  We've talked about the food, and the first time we've been able to run a sale or a special all year because we've worked so hard with the suppliers to get the $100 savings.
[03:01:01.178 --> 03:01:04.260]  That's exclusive right now at preparewithalex.com.
[03:01:04.961 --> 03:01:07.523]  Then there's the water, and this is just as important.
[03:01:07.563 --> 03:01:09.325]  You know, you only live three days without water.
[03:01:09.785 --> 03:01:14.329]  This is a kit we've never offered before that could help support the InfoWar.
[03:01:14.409 --> 03:01:16.851]  And for your viewers, your listeners, Alex,
[03:01:17.358 --> 03:01:22.762]  It's the Alexa Pure Pro that you always hear about, and that always comes with one filter that filters up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:01:23.242 --> 03:01:28.406]  Well, we've kind of amped this up, just like that sports car you were talking about there 20 minutes ago, the Shelby and all.
[03:01:28.766 --> 03:01:34.851]  We've amped this baby up where you can put four filters into the Alexa Pure Pro, so this thing can flow
[03:01:35.850 --> 03:01:41.272]  With gravity, we know electricity and purify up to 20,000 gallons of water.
[03:01:41.292 --> 03:01:44.453]  Sits on a nice stand that comes included in this kit.
[03:01:44.874 --> 03:01:48.355]  You can put some of the water into a collapsible water storage container.
[03:01:48.835 --> 03:01:50.516]  And we've even given you replacement parts.
[03:01:50.576 --> 03:01:57.838]  Today, on this site, RepairWithAlex.com, the Alexa Pure Pro Ultimate Kit is with $170 savings.
[03:02:00.233 --> 03:02:01.594]  So that's all sitting there as well.
[03:02:01.875 --> 03:02:03.376]  And then, of course, the Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:02:03.456 --> 03:02:10.022]  I mean, what a mess with the air and all the problems, wildfires from the West Coast blowing all the way across the northern states.
[03:02:10.483 --> 03:02:12.985]  New York was showing pictures yesterday of it and such.
[03:02:13.306 --> 03:02:15.948]  You don't want to breathe that junk in your home.
[03:02:16.289 --> 03:02:19.231]  That's what the Alexa Pure Breathe is all about.
[03:02:19.331 --> 03:02:21.093]  It's an indoor air filtration unit.
[03:02:21.433 --> 03:02:24.997]  It has a true HEPA system inside, a four-stage process that helps
[03:02:25.390 --> 03:02:26.371]  We're good to go.
[03:02:45.473 --> 03:02:46.034]  We're good to go.
[03:03:02.907 --> 03:03:07.089]  I know, I guess I'm locked into some type of funding, but this is very, very exciting.
[03:03:07.129 --> 03:03:09.009]  Preparewithalex.com.
[03:03:09.049 --> 03:03:10.150]  Preparewithalex.com.
[03:03:10.590 --> 03:03:13.391]  This is no doubt the best deals anywhere.
[03:03:13.411 --> 03:03:15.432]  This is the best deal you're going to find ever.
