[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:05.431]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:14.675]  Wednesday, February 12th, 2020.
[00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:18.697]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:48.202]  President Trump isn't waiting until he wins the election in 264 days to launch not the red wave but the red storm now engulfing the swamp in DC.
[00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:54.287]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of globalist operatives inside
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.486]  The State Department and the Justice Department and other agencies are being purged as we speak, thank God.
[00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:10.972]  Here we are on this Wednesday worldwide transmission and amazing things are happening.
[00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:23.562]  Trump is now finally realizing that he can't appease the bureaucracy, that the bureaucracy is more an enemy than the shycomps.
[00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.224]  The people that have burrowed in and taken control of the Republic, who believe that they own the American people.
[00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:45.956]  Their arrogance is now falling away and they are in a panicked mode because they've committed massive crimes in the last four and a half years trying to keep Trump out of office, they're trying to persecute his most stalwart supporters.
[00:01:48.297 --> 00:01:52.821]  And now they have the fear of God in their eyes and that is a good thing.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.722]  Here's what President Trump had to say yesterday after U.S.
[00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:08.265]  attorneys resigned because they want to give Roger Stone a record-long sentence.
[00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:19.650]  And, of course, you've got the head prosecutor who thought she was going to get a job at the Treasury who then resigned only to learn that that nomination was withdrawn.
[00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:22.892]  Here's President Trump talking about Roger Stone yesterday afternoon.
[00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:29.896]  Yeah, I thought it was ridiculous.
[00:02:30.656 --> 00:02:32.296]  No, I didn't speak to the judge.
[00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:33.777]  I'd be able to do it if I wanted.
[00:02:33.817 --> 00:02:35.057]  I have the absolute right to do it.
[00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:39.578]  I stay out of things to a degree that people wouldn't believe.
[00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:40.598]  But I didn't speak to him.
[00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.779]  I thought the recommendation was ridiculous.
[00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.160]  I thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.981]  And I look at others that haven't been prosecuted, or I don't know where it is now.
[00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.963]  But when you see that, I thought it was an insult to our country, and it shouldn't happen.
[00:02:56.063 --> 00:02:58.404]  And we'll see what goes on there.
[00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:03.425]  But that was a horrible aberration.
[00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:09.267]  These are the, I guess, the same Mueller people that put everybody through hell.
[00:03:10.268 --> 00:03:12.528]  And I think it's a disgrace.
[00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:14.669]  No, I have not been involved with it at all.
[00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:17.854]  I don't want to talk about that now.
[00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:20.095]  I think it was a disgraceful recommendation.
[00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:22.096]  They ought to be ashamed of themselves.
[00:03:22.477 --> 00:03:30.221]  What they've done to General Flynn, what they've done to others, and then the really guilty ones, people that have committed major crimes are getting away with it.
[00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:32.603]  I think it's a disgrace.
[00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:42.029]  President Trump is going to pardon Roger Stone after the conviction.
[00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:47.254]  Nancy Pelosi's trying to say that's illegal now, even though it's right there in the Constitution.
[00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:55.560]  Hell, Bill Clinton pardoned cocaine dealers and child traffickers, but all that's okay.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.762]  Trump's bad for trying to investigate corruption.
[00:03:58.242 --> 00:03:59.783]  America sees right through it.
[00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:01.064]  Really positive things are happening.
[00:04:01.744 --> 00:04:07.709]  Jussie Smollett, as he's called, Mr. Smollett, the mullet.
[00:04:09.352 --> 00:04:12.215]  Had the nerve to sue the police department for wrongful prosecution?
[00:04:12.235 --> 00:04:16.679]  Well, he's been indicted on a whole bunch of counts for the false flag operation.
[00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:18.120]  He got caught red-handed running.
[00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:19.861]  That's all coming up.
[00:04:20.502 --> 00:04:25.186]  Jussie Smollett indicted in Chicago over race attack hoax.
[00:04:26.407 --> 00:04:30.751]  Oh, but you're not supposed to question these big events, but we do, and most of the time they're staged.
[00:04:31.472 --> 00:04:33.634]  Just like ABC saying Trump allowed
[00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:41.761]  The Turks to blow up a Turkish city and that there were 5,000 foot red clouds.
[00:04:43.222 --> 00:04:43.862]  Mushroom clouds.
[00:04:43.882 --> 00:04:44.603]  None of it was true.
[00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:47.444]  Knob Creek machine gun shootout.
[00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:49.945]  And they knew damn well what they were doing.
[00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:52.587]  This group of criminals' time is coming to a close.
[00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:54.688]  But they've been so confident they'd win.
[00:04:54.748 --> 00:04:56.809]  What are they going to do now as they're routed?
[00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.751]  The collapse of the globalist system is upon us.
[00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:03.713]  The problem is it may bring down the economy with it.
[00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:10.686]  Well, I think this is a time to open the phones up throughout the entire four hours of my broadcast.
[00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:20.292]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are 264 days out from the election on this Wednesday, February 12th, 2020 transmission.
[00:05:22.714 --> 00:05:23.534]  Trump has done it.
[00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:30.059]  He's launched a massive legal lawful purge of deep staters in the government.
[00:05:31.024 --> 00:05:32.285]  It's true, Trump is an outsider.
[00:05:32.325 --> 00:05:34.345]  He'd never been elected to even dog catcher.
[00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:41.468]  He didn't realize it's customary to remove the political apparatus of the party that was in power when you get in power.
[00:05:41.548 --> 00:05:53.573]  Even if you're in the same party and you get into office, you remove the adjuncts that were working even for your own party usually because they are loyal to who put them in power, not even the party itself or the people.
[00:05:54.454 --> 00:06:01.799]  And so Trump had a major, major, major blunder when he did not remove those individuals.
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.284]  And so they were working against him the whole time as Obama and Hillary and neocon deep state moles.
[00:06:09.324 --> 00:06:11.566]  So now Trump says he's firing all Never Droppers.
[00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:12.647]  Excellent.
[00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:17.470]  And he is going to fire all anyone's work for Soros.
[00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.151]  Excellent.
[00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:19.972]  And anyone that's worked for the Clintons.
[00:06:20.192 --> 00:06:20.652]  Excellent.
[00:06:20.872 --> 00:06:21.353]  Excellent.
[00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:21.993]  Excellent.
[00:06:22.213 --> 00:06:22.614]  Excellent.
[00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.991]  And it's now hundreds and hundreds.
[00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.293]  It was 70 yesterday, now it's in the hundreds and hundreds.
[00:06:27.814 --> 00:06:31.958]  People are just being told, uh, bye-bye, you don't have a job anymore.
[00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:34.940]  Or they're being reassigned to the North Pole.
[00:06:40.005 --> 00:06:45.950]  And there needs to be a lot more of this, and Trump signaled that he's going to be pardoning Roger Stone.
[00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.732]  Pelosi says that she thinks it's illegal.
[00:06:49.178 --> 00:06:57.062]  That the DOJ, who does standardize and have recommendations from the top on what should be reasonable sentencing.
[00:06:57.523 --> 00:07:03.626]  Trump's whole justice reform movement is about having nonviolent people not serve as much time.
[00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:16.233]  So the idea that he can't, through the Justice Department, say, I want you to not give this person a longer sentence than you normally would in the sentencing guidelines, is 100% in his purview.
[00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:40.117]  Remember whenever he said three years ago, oh, there's seven countries that don't even have passport offices, don't even have airports, mainly, but the emoms issue these, and then we're supposed to accept these passports that are off the back of a cereal box, maybe, or out of a Cracker Jack box, and the media went, this is a power grab dictatorship.
[00:07:40.177 --> 00:07:42.038]  Of course, the Supreme Court ruled he could do that.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.741]  It's written in the Constitution that that's the President's purview.
[00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:48.301]  That's what the Chief Executive does.
[00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:49.181]  He's over the borders.
[00:07:50.242 --> 00:07:57.343]  But they tried to claim it was preposterous, and all these other federal courts, until they got to the Supreme Court, said he didn't have that power.
[00:08:00.064 --> 00:08:02.184]  How outrageous is that?
[00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:10.646]  Two months in jail for the swamp creature, yet 19 years recommended for Roger Stone, who's not even working for the Trump campaign.
[00:08:10.686 --> 00:08:13.147]  Gee, that sounds very fair, Roger.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.661]  Was the victim of rogue prosecutors?
[00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:18.643]  He goes on to say, right in the swamp.
[00:08:21.164 --> 00:08:22.926]  Rogue prosecutors, question mark?
[00:08:24.327 --> 00:08:27.128]  That's like saying, does Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer have a red nose?
[00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:28.409]  This is ridiculous.
[00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.872]  So a lot of exciting things happening on that front.
[00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:39.077]  Virginia has passed in their legislature, I guess the governor's got to sign it,
[00:08:40.655 --> 00:08:44.980]  A bill to ban semi-autos and suppressors and much more.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.082]  So that nightmare situation.
[00:08:47.983 --> 00:08:53.488]  Virginia House passes ban on semi-auto firearms and suppressors in hyper-partisan vote.
[00:08:54.469 --> 00:08:58.013]  We're going to be getting into all that today as well.
[00:08:58.053 --> 00:08:59.234]  The latest on the virus.
[00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:02.608]  Dr. Francis Boyle is going to be joining us.
[00:09:02.728 --> 00:09:03.609]  He was on last week.
[00:09:04.189 --> 00:09:08.291]  Now we have the Trump administration officially saying they believe it could be a man-made bioweapon.
[00:09:08.712 --> 00:09:11.433]  You have the Chinese ambassador saying, that's crazy!
[00:09:12.654 --> 00:09:13.134]  Wow!
[00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:15.636]  Crazy conspiracy theory.
[00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:19.618]  Don't look here, just, oh, like Jussie Smollett.
[00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:23.440]  We first came out
[00:09:25.446 --> 00:09:33.089]  The morning after it happened and I said, 2.30 in the morning, white dudes with bleach and a rope attacking a black guy in Sub-Zero.
[00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:40.613]  That sounds about as probable as seeing Santa Claus actually fly by in the middle of the night.
[00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:45.455]  Jussie Smollett indicted in Chicago over race attack hoax.
[00:09:46.889 --> 00:10:01.857]  Former Empire actor Jussie Smollett, as a lot of folks call him, was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago on six counts of disorderly conduct for lying to police about the alleged racist and anti-gay attack on him that occurred in January last year.
[00:10:02.778 --> 00:10:04.799]  One that was defended by Maxine Waters and others.
[00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:05.519]  He's a great guy.
[00:10:05.979 --> 00:10:10.862]  The indictment was brought forward by Special Prosecutor Dan Webb last night, according to Fox 32.
[00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.283]  We're going to play a clip of that.
[00:10:13.303 --> 00:10:15.825]  But yeah, let's go back to video for TV viewers.
[00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:29.100]  Imagine the police show up at his multi-million dollar condo and he's explaining, oh it happened an hour ago, I've still got the rope around my neck and a little scratch on his face.
[00:10:32.043 --> 00:10:33.704]  And then he talks about how terrible it is.
[00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:37.367]  And then he has a whole trail of how he did it.
[00:10:37.808 --> 00:10:39.950]  But how the media defended him.
[00:10:41.024 --> 00:10:44.847]  And even attacked me and said, Jones is at it again, questioning things.
[00:10:45.768 --> 00:10:48.930]  You're not supposed to do that.
[00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:53.894]  And so again, the police show up and they don't buy any of it.
[00:10:54.294 --> 00:10:55.175]  Look at the news.
[00:10:55.295 --> 00:10:56.496]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:57.716 --> 00:11:02.820]  Of course, almost all of these racial attacks are as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:11:03.701 --> 00:11:04.962]  Here's the local news report on it.
[00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:08.122]  Jussie Smollett.
[00:11:08.483 --> 00:11:09.403]  Remember him?
[00:11:09.924 --> 00:11:14.568]  Well, he has been indicted today by a special prosecutor in Chicago.
[00:11:14.588 --> 00:11:24.237]  The former Empire actor was indicted today in Chicago by special prosecutor Dan Webb stemming from the alleged racist and anti-gay attack
[00:11:24.737 --> 00:11:26.618]  On him that occurred in January of 2019.
[00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:32.502]  A source confirms to our sister station Fox 32 News in Chicago.
[00:11:32.582 --> 00:11:40.546]  Smollett told Chicago police last year that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs.
[00:11:41.087 --> 00:11:49.892]  Prosecutors insist Smollett faked the racist anti-gay attack on himself in the hopes that the attention would advance his acting career.
[00:11:50.612 --> 00:12:01.474]  But with little explanation, authorities last year abruptly dropped all charges against Smollett, abandoning the criminal case only five weeks after the allegations were filed.
[00:12:01.914 --> 00:12:07.975]  In return, prosecutors said that the actor agreed to let the city keep his $10,000 in bail.
[00:12:08.415 --> 00:12:18.197]  The dismissal drew a swift backlash from the mayor and police chief and raised questions about why Smollett was not forced to admit that prosecutors had said
[00:12:18.837 --> 00:12:23.643]  That they could prove in court that the entire episode was a publicity stunt.
[00:12:24.684 --> 00:12:26.386]  Just like everything the Democrats did.
[00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:28.549]  Just like the attacks on the Jewish centers.
[00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:30.691]  Or the attacks at the Air Force Academy.
[00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:32.854]  Or the attacks here, there, everywhere.
[00:12:33.414 --> 00:12:35.337]  It's what the left does.
[00:12:37.352 --> 00:12:43.818]  My security people have caught them at rallies coming up and punching me in the back or pinching me and trying to get me to hit them.
[00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:49.504]  And it's usually somebody in a wheelchair doing it because they want to have the image of me slugging somebody in a wheelchair.
[00:12:50.385 --> 00:12:52.787]  They're professional victims.
[00:12:53.808 --> 00:12:54.769]  That's what the left do.
[00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:55.950]  They virtue signal.
[00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.894]  But studies show they're nine times more likely not to give to charity.
[00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.751]  They could be black, they could be white, they could be old, they could be young.
[00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:10.316]  But what they do is manipulate and deceive and create division 24-7.
[00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:14.779]  Newsflash!
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:21.085]  There's not white dudes at 2.30 in the morning at 25 below zero running up starting fights with black dudes.
[00:13:22.287 --> 00:13:26.469]  It's not going on and everybody knows it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:29.751]  But this was an attempt to trigger a race war in this country.
[00:13:30.051 --> 00:13:32.112]  The same thing Soros has been caught doing.
[00:13:32.372 --> 00:13:33.573]  His son's been caught doing.
[00:13:33.593 --> 00:13:34.533]  We have all the documents.
[00:13:35.074 --> 00:13:41.437]  Hoping to foment a race war in this country with the media trying to exacerbate the crisis.
[00:13:41.897 --> 00:13:43.058]  This is terrorism!
[00:13:43.758 --> 00:13:47.341]  Psychological warfare executed against the American people.
[00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:50.663]  But notice, all the criminality of the Democrats isn't working anymore.
[00:13:51.204 --> 00:13:53.846]  So now as Trump strikes back, what's coming next?
[00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:55.307]  We'll break it down when we come back.
[00:13:55.627 --> 00:14:04.814]  Please don't forget, we are going to sell out in the next few days of Super Silver 3-ounce and Super Silver 1-ounce immune gargle.
[00:14:05.934 --> 00:14:07.355]  We've already sold out of the 16-ounce.
[00:14:07.415 --> 00:14:08.997]  We are going to sell out of the Super Silver
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.360]  What's
[00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:36.740]  When you're demoralized, when you're down, you feel like you can't do anything.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.900]  You feel like your back's broken.
[00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:16.072]  But as soon as you start to get up and get engaged and start fighting back, start getting the blood pumping through your brain, through your muscles, through your body, you feel alive again.
[00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.894]  And you don't feel like giving up.
[00:15:18.934 --> 00:15:20.415]  You feel like fighting back.
[00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:26.020]  And make no mistake, humanity has some incredible obstacles facing it.
[00:15:29.138 --> 00:15:35.520]  But we also have God on our side, and the atheists and the establishment want us to believe that we're all alone in the universe and we don't have God.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.720]  But they know that's not true.
[00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:44.902]  They want us to forget about God so that we don't realize the birthright we have.
[00:15:46.323 --> 00:15:51.024]  So on this February 12th, Wednesday edition, I just want listeners to know something.
[00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:57.206]  There's a lot of different political ideas and systems out there.
[00:15:58.544 --> 00:16:00.926]  But they all really boil down to two different groups.
[00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:06.112]  Systems that empower humanity and that are based on common sense and God's law.
[00:16:06.572 --> 00:16:14.500]  And those that destroy humanity and are based on systems that don't work and are corrupt.
[00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:16.583]  And God has a name for that.
[00:16:16.623 --> 00:16:17.464]  It's called sin.
[00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.331]  Consent is just simply something that hurts you and hurts others.
[00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:26.451]  And it's not in God's plan.
[00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:30.092]  But see, you've got free will, so you can say piss on the owner's manual.
[00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:34.332]  It says put this type of motor oil in here, I'm gonna put bleach in it.
[00:16:34.352 --> 00:16:39.253]  And when it blows up, well that's not Ford's fault, is it?
[00:16:39.913 --> 00:16:43.934]  It's not Ferrari's fault, it's not Chevy's fault, it's not Honda's fault.
[00:16:45.414 --> 00:16:49.575]  You put salt water in the gas tank, it doesn't work.
[00:16:52.537 --> 00:16:59.219]  But it's, I guess, kind of fun when you're doing it at first, watching the engine seize up, I guess.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.560]  So here's what I wanted to say right now.
[00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:21.586]  We've seen all these people that got into the power structure and went to Harvard, went to Yale, and got into bureaucracy, and both political parties shared power in the sellout of America, to demoralizers, got behind the whole Hollywood system, try to break the will of the American people.
[00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:25.834]  But they miscalculated.
[00:17:25.894 --> 00:17:29.537]  They believed that they had frightened us and demoralized us.
[00:17:29.857 --> 00:17:32.179]  The truth is they just put us into a trance.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.044]  And now all this intimidation has just taken a lot of people out of the trance and it's only pissing them off more.
[00:17:38.464 --> 00:17:40.786]  There's a lot of examples of this I could give, but look at Brexit.
[00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:48.032]  I told people four and a half years ago when it passed, I said, mark my words, this will take three to five years to finally get implemented.
[00:17:49.113 --> 00:17:52.836]  And in the process of them trying to block the people, they'll wake up even more.
[00:17:53.056 --> 00:17:54.197]  And exactly that happened.
[00:17:55.691 --> 00:17:58.953]  Because when you've studied history, it does repeat itself.
[00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:17.287]  So now I've tried to keep track of it, but it's hundreds and hundreds of people have been fired in the last two days by President Trump from senior positions at the Justice Department and the State Department and the National Security Council.
[00:18:19.328 --> 00:18:20.229]  And it's a beautiful thing.
[00:18:23.052 --> 00:18:28.816]  And when he was paralyzed before because it was nothing but bad people under him, he didn't know what he was doing.
[00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:30.217]  Now he's a quick learner.
[00:18:31.238 --> 00:18:39.905]  And so, oh, you're being nominated over here at the Treasury Department, the woman that prosecuted Stone and engaged in all those incredible crimes, in my view.
[00:18:40.505 --> 00:18:42.466]  And by the way, I was under investigation.
[00:18:42.547 --> 00:18:44.248]  My father was under investigation.
[00:18:51.155 --> 00:18:57.437]  Feds tried to set me up, posing as Russians.
[00:19:00.058 --> 00:19:05.100]  And this is off record, but there's national talk show hosts know about it, the documents.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.560]  I've been into the FBI.
[00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:09.921]  I've been into the FBI offices.
[00:19:11.542 --> 00:19:12.342]  That's how far this went.
[00:19:15.373 --> 00:19:19.135]  And just imagine how crazed the Democrats were.
[00:19:19.535 --> 00:19:24.757]  They wanted to put me and my father in prison.
[00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:26.178]  They thought that dog would hunt.
[00:19:26.418 --> 00:19:30.180]  That the American people would believe that I was a Russian agent and that my dad was one.
[00:19:34.502 --> 00:19:39.624]  That's with the government being able to look at my records and my dad's records and knowing that it's the opposite.
[00:19:47.526 --> 00:19:48.186]  Why are we here?
[00:19:49.167 --> 00:20:09.115]  Because these arrogant SOBs thought that they were invincible, and they sent the message out across the country to every bureaucracy, to every lawyer, to every fellow traveler, harass Trump supporters, spit on their food, sue them, lie about them, try to convince their wives and husbands to leave them.
[00:20:09.515 --> 00:20:14.157]  This is the harassment that's been going on, but instead of the harassment,
[00:20:15.845 --> 00:20:20.867]  Four years later, working, all it's done is piss people off and made them get more hardcore.
[00:20:21.607 --> 00:20:23.208]  And that's what's beautiful about all of this.
[00:20:26.729 --> 00:20:32.371]  Again, I hadn't watched a lot of World War II documentaries in years, but I watched World War II in color, great documentary series.
[00:20:33.792 --> 00:20:38.473]  The first couple hours is the war starting and the Battle of Britain and the Blitz.
[00:20:39.314 --> 00:20:44.896]  And Hitler really thought, if I bomb London, they'll give up.
[00:20:45.998 --> 00:20:54.001]  British intelligence knew if they bombed Berlin, which they did, just to piss Hitler off, he would target the British people, and that would get them behind the war.
[00:20:54.041 --> 00:21:09.448]  They were not for the war, they just lost millions a few decades before in World War I. Almost everybody had lost somebody or had somebody in their home, you know, with their arms and legs blown off, or their lungs burned out from mustard gas, and so they didn't want that.
[00:21:10.408 --> 00:21:12.149]  But when Hitler bombed for
[00:21:16.075 --> 00:21:23.940]  Hundreds of days straight, the polls went from 70% against the war to 99% for it.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.420]  Wow!
[00:21:25.881 --> 00:21:27.502]  So the Democrats thought the same thing.
[00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:37.287]  You think threatening us, trying to put us in prison, trying to set us up, suing us, you think doing all of this made me want to go get in a fetal position and piss all over myself?
[00:21:37.807 --> 00:21:39.909]  You think it made the American people want to back down?
[00:21:40.825 --> 00:21:41.787]  It did the opposite.
[00:21:42.288 --> 00:21:45.996]  It made us really want to get our hands around your throats.
[00:21:47.694 --> 00:21:57.376]  That's what it did, it made me work even more hours, and have more energy, and get in better shape, and get closer to God, and your persecution made me stronger.
[00:21:57.856 --> 00:22:01.056]  Frederick Nietzsche's right, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:22:01.356 --> 00:22:09.198]  But only because of God, and God working through the audience that supported us, just like I have that spirit, you have that spirit, viewers.
[00:22:09.818 --> 00:22:12.678]  That's why when you call in and thank me, are you kidding me?
[00:22:13.758 --> 00:22:14.339]  Thank you!
[00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:16.699]  Because I've got a heart to fight.
[00:22:19.807 --> 00:22:22.891]  But you had to keep us in the game and we're not out of the woods yet.
[00:22:22.911 --> 00:22:28.159]  But let me tell you, I can kind of see some openings and see some pretty green hills out there.
[00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:29.060]  We're getting close.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.063]  There'll be more woods we got across later.
[00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.244]  That's the way life is.
[00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:34.628]  There's no utopia we're offering like Bernie Sanders does.
[00:22:36.758 --> 00:22:44.160]  America's been down on its knees a long time, and America's starting to stand up, and that is a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.761]  So we're going to come back, play a bunch of clips.
[00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:46.941]  I'm going to give the number out.
[00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:54.923]  First-time callers again, I want to get your take on the world, what you think of Trump beginning to move forward against the deep state, what else he needs to do, how they're going to counter-strike.
[00:22:54.943 --> 00:22:55.423]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[00:22:55.523 --> 00:22:56.584]  International line, your country code, 512-646.
[00:23:04.646 --> 00:23:06.107]  1776, but make no mistake.
[00:23:06.627 --> 00:23:07.608]  This is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:07.648 --> 00:23:10.350]  This is the epicenter of the global populist awakening.
[00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.933]  The audience of this broadcast is not an audience.
[00:23:15.013 --> 00:23:17.254]  You are the men and women at the center of the arena.
[00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:19.215]  You are amazing.
[00:23:20.636 --> 00:23:22.657]  I don't care what mainstream media calls me.
[00:23:23.618 --> 00:23:26.440]  The same mainstream media caught launching hoaxes routinely.
[00:23:28.581 --> 00:23:30.262]  But I do care about what God thinks.
[00:23:30.422 --> 00:23:31.463]  I do care about what you think.
[00:23:32.449 --> 00:23:33.770]  I do care about what my children think.
[00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:38.314]  I want to be a man that they know stands up for what he knows is right.
[00:23:39.175 --> 00:23:40.456]  Who doesn't back down from a fight.
[00:23:41.777 --> 00:23:43.558]  Because that's really what this life's all about.
[00:23:43.578 --> 00:23:46.180]  It's a test to see who you are.
[00:23:47.762 --> 00:23:49.283]  Selling out doesn't feel good, folks.
[00:23:49.403 --> 00:23:53.286]  Fighting back and having integrity, well, it's what it's all about.
[00:23:53.306 --> 00:23:56.028]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:23:56.048 --> 00:23:56.248]  877-789-Alex.
[00:24:02.861 --> 00:24:11.386]  Got a lot of clips, a lot of news to cover, but I really just want to start taking a lot of your calls, but I want to just pull back and get back to what I was saying last segment, because it cannot be overstated.
[00:24:14.528 --> 00:24:16.929]  The Democrats control their blue cities.
[00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:18.670]  They're hated.
[00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:21.152]  No one really votes for them.
[00:24:21.332 --> 00:24:22.232]  They're a total fraud.
[00:24:23.813 --> 00:24:28.756]  They do have some of the brainwashed college students and people that think they're part of the establishment that are useful that he has to go along with it.
[00:24:29.892 --> 00:24:41.295]  And they ruthlessly work with organized crime from MS-13 to the Chinese triads to bleed off all the money, to launder it, and to basically engage in crimes never before seen at this scale.
[00:24:43.876 --> 00:24:52.399]  And the blue-blood Republicans went along with this for the last 50, 60 years, but they're being removed from power, and they are systematically dying off right now.
[00:24:54.099 --> 00:24:56.940]  And so, yes, President Trump is beginning to strike back.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.440]  And remove a lot of the deep staters.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.401]  That's beautiful and wonderful.
[00:25:00.421 --> 00:25:04.262]  But we've got to keep the pressure now on Trump to make sure he does the right thing.
[00:25:04.282 --> 00:25:05.702]  And that leads me to this next point.
[00:25:07.563 --> 00:25:11.744]  There are two big reports out today that nexus together.
[00:25:14.385 --> 00:25:17.886]  And that's the fact that Russiagate was a premeditated hoax.
[00:25:18.946 --> 00:25:22.527]  Even the federal FISA court's own inspector general has said that.
[00:25:24.588 --> 00:25:28.189]  And that it was done to illegally spy on the President.
[00:25:29.649 --> 00:25:45.993]  Well, if you watch the Congressional hearings, through which the Democrats gave the public orders, via Senator Blumenthal and others, to remove yours truly from the Internet, that was the precedent setting to do it to everybody else.
[00:25:46.133 --> 00:25:51.034]  And they did it in the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, and the House Armed Services Committee in the House.
[00:25:52.441 --> 00:26:02.105]  And the Judiciary Committee in the House, with hearings for hours, talking about myself, Roger Stone and many others, saying we work for the Russians.
[00:26:02.205 --> 00:26:04.306]  Now I'm not going to play those clips again, you've all heard them.
[00:26:06.087 --> 00:26:08.248]  And they have tech heads there going, what are you going to do?
[00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:12.689]  Paul Watson's story was top of Twitter, Infowars.com, at lunch.
[00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:18.332]  They said, sir, we know, Congressman Quigley, we're going to get that banned.
[00:26:18.372 --> 00:26:21.333]  In fact, we banned it by the end of lunch.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.981]  And Quigley said, that's not good enough.
[00:26:25.081 --> 00:26:26.982]  I don't want their fake news up there at the top.
[00:26:27.702 --> 00:26:28.602]  What was the fake news?
[00:26:28.642 --> 00:26:29.503]  Just that one example.
[00:26:30.803 --> 00:26:34.165]  Was that a man had run over a crowd screaming al-Akbar in New York.
[00:26:34.185 --> 00:26:34.685]  It was true.
[00:26:34.705 --> 00:26:39.428]  It was even on the local news, but nationally, they were able to suppress it was an Islamic attack.
[00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:47.812]  And so, the fake news litmus was, Congressman Quigley said it was fake.
[00:26:48.132 --> 00:26:51.774]  They're like, oh yes, we know at lunch, we saw it and buried it.
[00:26:55.069 --> 00:27:24.098]  So Trump's thinking he's been exonerated on Russiagate and UkraineGrate and all this crap, and he's starting to remove the bureaucrats, people that did it, but they gave the orders before that went out through the Mockingbird national security apparatus that's supposedly only used for the Cold War against the Soviets, but Obama legalized it 10 years ago to use domestic propaganda against the American people, including disinformation.
[00:27:27.935 --> 00:27:31.516]  And so now the Justice Department head lawyer over antitrust came out.
[00:27:31.556 --> 00:27:33.517]  There's an article in Hollywood Reporter.
[00:27:34.017 --> 00:27:37.338]  DOJ won't tackle politically biased media.
[00:27:37.879 --> 00:27:38.879]  It's not our job.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.261]  But big tech isn't politically biased media.
[00:27:44.381 --> 00:27:47.422]  It's a utility that operates under Section 230.
[00:27:48.383 --> 00:27:51.984]  It isn't supposed to restrict what people say in live time using AI.
[00:27:54.397 --> 00:27:59.299]  And so they go on to say we don't get involved in what company's speech is, but it's not companies.
[00:27:59.379 --> 00:28:04.560]  It's Facebook and Twitter and Google and its subsidiary YouTube all spying in live time.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:13.243]  And now WhatsApp for months is admittedly going in and blocking Alex Jones, Jordan Peterson and Donald Trump videos.
[00:28:14.761 --> 00:28:26.452]  And now Nancy Pelosi videos because she doesn't like her tearing things up and it's being put up with prior constraint with big tech using AI to pre-program what you can send?
[00:28:26.472 --> 00:28:31.096]  That's surveillance, that's control, that's concerted.
[00:28:31.116 --> 00:28:35.840]  I told people 20 years ago your cameras are spying on you.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.821]  It was in the documents.
[00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:39.083]  Now they ask the question stupidly today.
[00:28:39.964 --> 00:28:41.025]  Getting everybody ready for it.
[00:28:42.108 --> 00:28:53.577]  We're just being conditioned to accept it, and we should not accept the surveillance, the spying, the selling of our data, and then lying to Congress and saying, Google's never fixed a search result.
[00:28:54.558 --> 00:28:59.863]  So they make it purely an antitrust issue, when clearly we've never seen monopolies this big.
[00:29:00.223 --> 00:29:03.906]  Google and its parent company, Alphabet, dwarf anything Microsoft ever was.
[00:29:06.408 --> 00:29:09.310]  And now the Pentagon is letting Microsoft take over
[00:29:10.265 --> 00:29:16.786]  And unify the cloud system for the codes, the coordination of fighter bombers.
[00:29:18.106 --> 00:29:21.727]  Anybody ever seen Terminator 2 and Skynet?
[00:29:25.748 --> 00:29:27.148]  So that's where we are.
[00:29:27.368 --> 00:29:32.709]  And the truth is there's a big sick marriage of big tech and government and Trump knows that.
[00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:35.809]  And so it's a big failing.
[00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.390]  That they are going to just let
[00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:45.530]  Big Tech put the Chinese social credit score, lifetime surveillance grid over all of us.
[00:29:46.411 --> 00:29:49.034]  And the decision has been made to just go ahead with the plan.
[00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:59.765]  And then use it to suppress even mainline political speech.
[00:30:01.087 --> 00:30:16.093]  The condition you to show you the only type of speech you can put out is that that's been pre-programmed and then whoever gets control of these companies can then just change the drop of a hat what they see as acceptable in live time and now they're announcing, you know what?
[00:30:17.413 --> 00:30:22.215]  Big Tech now has all these digital phone calls you can make over the apps that sound just as good as a phone or better.
[00:30:23.131 --> 00:30:24.372]  Don't need your phone system anymore.
[00:30:24.392 --> 00:30:29.936]  And oh, but the AI is going to be listening to that and it's going to just block out words you aren't supposed to say.
[00:30:30.296 --> 00:30:32.358]  That could be done in live time now.
[00:30:36.621 --> 00:30:49.711]  And so we can sit here and celebrate going after the Democrat Deep State and the neocons and all these horrible people, but is Trump just going to replace himself at the head of that?
[00:30:50.899 --> 00:31:00.501]  Because Tim Cook comes over and has dinner with him and Ivanka and Jared and, you know, oh, maybe Apple's got a couple hundred plants over in China and he'll bring two or three over here.
[00:31:00.801 --> 00:31:11.283]  So for that pat on the head, we're just going to let Apple and Tim Cook control everything and censor and block and not let people's information be available in the free market of ideas?
[00:31:11.983 --> 00:31:13.164]  That isn't dangerous.
[00:31:13.784 --> 00:31:15.404]  That's destructive.
[00:31:16.204 --> 00:31:19.885]  And that is tyranny playing out and taking place now.
[00:31:21.621 --> 00:31:27.643]  And so I'm happy to see Smollett indicted, and I'm happy to see all these arrogant globalists getting fired, and that's a good sign.
[00:31:27.703 --> 00:31:40.686]  But the Justice Department comes out a month ago, and the Attorney General said, well, we probably might not do the whole antitrusting, but there could be other criminal charges for things they've been doing.
[00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:41.786]  Well, what could that be?
[00:31:41.847 --> 00:31:42.647]  Lying to Congress?
[00:31:42.687 --> 00:31:43.627]  Working with the shy comms?
[00:31:43.967 --> 00:31:45.387]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[00:31:46.208 --> 00:31:48.968]  And I'd like to see the beginning of this forward motion against the tyranny.
[00:31:49.008 --> 00:31:50.009]  That's very positive.
[00:31:52.594 --> 00:32:08.549]  We better see the President and the Justice Department tell Big Tech, you better stop reading people's text messages in real time and blocking them and controlling what people can say.
[00:32:08.589 --> 00:32:10.951]  That's un-American and that's beyond dangerous.
[00:32:11.692 --> 00:32:13.153]  And so that's where I stand on all of this.
[00:32:14.246 --> 00:32:32.368]  The very groups that are now being shown to be frauds that tried to have a coup and overthrow an elected president and steal the votes of 65 million Americans that voted for Trump, or 68 million, used that lie of Russiagate to put the censorship in that's now in place through the COG.
[00:32:34.068 --> 00:32:39.710]  Systems put in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2017 by Obama before he left.
[00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.250]  And so that's being left in place.
[00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:46.271]  The Russia hoax is still operating and still violating Americans' rights.
[00:32:47.752 --> 00:32:49.572]  The red storm is here.
[00:32:53.493 --> 00:32:56.414]  The unification of red.
[00:32:57.394 --> 00:32:57.994]  The blood.
[00:32:59.315 --> 00:33:00.255]  We all share it.
[00:33:01.584 --> 00:33:02.444]  We are the people.
[00:33:02.624 --> 00:33:03.625]  We are the commoners.
[00:33:04.405 --> 00:33:06.145]  We are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:33:06.306 --> 00:33:07.486]  We are the innovation.
[00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:09.587]  We are the builders.
[00:33:12.307 --> 00:33:13.148]  You belong.
[00:33:13.168 --> 00:33:17.809]  And they're trying to steal your American birthright from you.
[00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:20.910]  This country's so damn bad, why does everybody want to get into it?
[00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:26.572]  Because they know it's the place where people at least tried to be free.
[00:33:26.592 --> 00:33:29.373]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:33:30.987 --> 00:33:35.468]  And I don't gloat about the fact that Trump's finally purging a lot of the scum.
[00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:37.888]  It's hundreds and hundreds.
[00:33:38.488 --> 00:33:40.489]  It's just pouring in so fast.
[00:33:41.369 --> 00:33:44.389]  He's getting rid of any Obama people, any Hillary people.
[00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:51.931]  When Clinton got in, in 1993, he fired every U.S.
[00:33:51.991 --> 00:33:52.351]  attorney.
[00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:57.612]  Trump didn't fire any, and they said that he was misusing his power.
[00:33:59.943 --> 00:34:05.725]  Trump should fire everyone who hasn't already shown themselves to be loyal.
[00:34:08.225 --> 00:34:11.526]  He cannot leave his flank and his underbelly open.
[00:34:12.827 --> 00:34:17.448]  And the president's done nothing corrupt other than putting up with these corrupt people.
[00:34:17.508 --> 00:34:21.709]  That is a form of corruption in and of itself and a dereliction of duty.
[00:34:21.749 --> 00:34:22.910]  But I understand he's been surrounded.
[00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:24.970]  But this is very pleasing.
[00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:26.571]  We'd all wondered,
[00:34:29.918 --> 00:34:32.700]  Would he wait to go after him until he got re-elected or would he strike now?
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.082]  He understands that they're not going to just sit there idly by.
[00:34:36.102 --> 00:34:37.784]  They're going to continue fake impeachments.
[00:34:37.804 --> 00:34:39.145]  They're going to continue making stuff up.
[00:34:39.685 --> 00:34:43.788]  So if Trump wants to survive, he's got to go on the attack.
[00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:47.951]  And what does that entail?
[00:34:48.011 --> 00:34:48.711]  What do you think?
[00:34:49.172 --> 00:34:50.272]  Where do you see this going?
[00:34:50.392 --> 00:34:52.894]  And doesn't he need to reverse the rest of it?
[00:34:54.335 --> 00:34:56.196]  That they use the whole Russiagate hoax
[00:34:57.185 --> 00:35:09.968]  With Obama's countering foreign disinformation propaganda act with billions of dollars to set up this surveillance grid that's been coordinated and this censorship grid that's been coordinated against his grassroots?
[00:35:13.529 --> 00:35:14.269]  I can take it.
[00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.471]  In fact, at a sick level, I like it.
[00:35:19.391 --> 00:35:19.731]  It's true.
[00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:23.872]  I mean, I don't like pain and being messed with, but it definitely gets me to wake up.
[00:35:25.031 --> 00:35:28.874]  I can be exhausted and some new attack comes and I'm like, have all this energy.
[00:35:29.374 --> 00:35:31.235]  But a lot of people don't like being treated like that.
[00:35:31.416 --> 00:35:32.997]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:35:33.357 --> 00:35:35.578]  We don't deserve to be treated like that.
[00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:38.801]  And it's criminal to let these people continue to do it.
[00:35:38.841 --> 00:35:39.861]  So I'm telling the president.
[00:35:41.863 --> 00:35:43.444]  We need relief and we need it now.
[00:35:53.171 --> 00:35:54.432]  So what does that relief look like?
[00:35:55.401 --> 00:35:57.762]  There's an operation I've been so busy the last three weeks.
[00:35:57.782 --> 00:36:01.783]  So we have a warehouse full of these stickers.
[00:36:01.823 --> 00:36:06.044]  In fact, we have for Shea, bring me the latest completed stickers, please call him right now.
[00:36:08.465 --> 00:36:14.287]  We have stickers that are the size, they're about half the size that fit over the mouth, that look like duct tape, but they don't pull your hair out.
[00:36:14.507 --> 00:36:16.748]  They're not that, the sticker's not that strong, thank God.
[00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:21.209]  But it looks like duct tape, and it says, indict the traitors.
[00:36:21.229 --> 00:36:22.890]  20 different stickers.
[00:36:24.033 --> 00:36:24.854]  Save the First Amendment.
[00:36:24.874 --> 00:36:25.674]  Save the Second Amendment.
[00:36:26.155 --> 00:36:27.015]  Operation Win 2020.
[00:36:27.455 --> 00:36:27.776]  Ban.
[00:36:27.976 --> 00:36:28.376]  Video.
[00:36:29.617 --> 00:36:30.518]  Save InfoWars.
[00:36:31.818 --> 00:36:37.022]  And every order gets some of these thrown in free, or you can order these babies at cost.
[00:36:37.783 --> 00:36:38.403]  Operation Win 2020.
[00:36:38.503 --> 00:36:38.863]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:36:38.903 --> 00:36:42.026]  You can order packs of 100, 500, and 1,000 at cost.
[00:36:42.046 --> 00:36:42.466]  A 1,000 pack is $199.
[00:36:42.566 --> 00:36:42.766]  A 500 pack
[00:36:55.723 --> 00:36:56.383]  We're good to go.
[00:36:56.403 --> 00:36:57.224]  We're good to go.
[00:37:25.652 --> 00:37:33.199]  And you go to Trump events and hand these out and put them over your mouth, it will become a big sensation and folks will ask, why are you wearing it?
[00:37:33.459 --> 00:37:35.641]  Then you just pull it off and explain to them and put it back on.
[00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:44.829]  And then say we want the president to do something about the censorship and about the suppression and about how AI is being used to track what we do in live time and control us.
[00:37:45.149 --> 00:37:47.951]  That's un-American, it's dangerous, it's just what the chi-coms are doing.
[00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:52.735]  Everybody freaked out when China blocks emojis of Taiwan or Hong Kong being sent out.
[00:37:53.547 --> 00:37:56.748]  And then Apple had to admit it and had to apologize, but went back to doing it again.
[00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:58.369]  We're being tested here.
[00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:00.849]  We have to say no to this.
[00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:11.033]  So, we'll be at a lot of the Trump events handing these out, but it's a way to peaceful.
[00:38:11.053 --> 00:38:13.874]  A way to peacefully.
[00:38:15.552 --> 00:38:21.520]  Go in and not disrupt things, but have everybody start asking you, why are you upset?
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.425]  And by the way, I think the cute thing has been disinformation from the start.
[00:38:25.945 --> 00:38:30.911]  And you know, makes ridiculously easy predictions like, the vote for impeachment will be along party lines.
[00:38:31.292 --> 00:38:33.294]  That's very easy to predict.
[00:38:33.735 --> 00:38:37.898]  But I'm not going to fight with folks that are into Q and like it, and like to research things.
[00:38:37.938 --> 00:38:38.798]  That's healthy to do.
[00:38:39.098 --> 00:38:44.382]  So there's a sticker in the pack that says, I am Q, in pollwars.com.
[00:38:44.462 --> 00:38:44.762]  Great!
[00:38:44.862 --> 00:38:45.543]  Q is wonderful.
[00:38:46.423 --> 00:38:48.865]  I've never been about infighting, so I'm not going to get into infighting with...
[00:38:52.073 --> 00:38:58.136]  Well, the god of the universe, Q. So, I bow to Q. You are all powerful.
[00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:02.278]  And we just have the sticker there now that says it.
[00:39:02.678 --> 00:39:04.279]  I am Q, InfoWars.com.
[00:39:04.319 --> 00:39:04.840]  We love you.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.700]  It's wonderful.
[00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:08.862]  Art Mueller is going to save us.
[00:39:10.555 --> 00:39:15.661]  The point is, I'm not fighting with folks that are into it, and it creates community, and that's great, and that's what we're all about.
[00:39:16.042 --> 00:39:17.904]  They saw InfoWars as community.
[00:39:18.345 --> 00:39:25.573]  The globalists saw InfoWars as a communication system, and as a nationalist, populist movement that could unify people to bring back Americana.
[00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:26.895]  That's why they demonized it.
[00:39:26.935 --> 00:39:27.856]  That's why they attacked it.
[00:39:28.117 --> 00:39:28.998]  That's why they shut it down.
[00:39:31.015 --> 00:39:31.795]  But they failed.
[00:39:32.495 --> 00:39:34.236]  And now it's come back even stronger than ever.
[00:39:34.416 --> 00:39:36.716]  So I believe InfoWars is a great rallying call.
[00:39:37.097 --> 00:39:37.737]  So is Trump.
[00:39:38.257 --> 00:39:40.797]  But Trump and InfoWars can come and go.
[00:39:41.538 --> 00:39:50.880]  The idea of just 1776 and we the people, and just the American flag itself and what it stands for, that really is our rallying point and should be our rallying call.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.121]  All right, we'll start the second hour and I promise go to all of your calls.
[00:39:55.984 --> 00:40:02.908]  We need action from Trump on the coordinated big tech suppression of nationalists, Christians, conservatives, you name it.
[00:40:03.428 --> 00:40:07.171]  And just, you know, all the things that are happening, all the things that are unfolding.
[00:40:08.351 --> 00:40:10.032]  This is concerted organized crime.
[00:40:10.993 --> 00:40:17.997]  And if the Italian mafia was trying to tell people what they could say and do on some communication system, I assure you they would get indicted.
[00:40:18.197 --> 00:40:19.278]  But they wouldn't even do that.
[00:40:20.269 --> 00:40:35.138]  But when the Democrats and Big Tech are in bed with Communist China, literally enslaving their people, and everywhere we're being told to erase men out of the world, and erase families, and erase children, it's sick, and it's dangerous, and something needs to be done.
[00:40:35.779 --> 00:40:44.844]  We got callers from Finland, and callers from all over the United States, so we're going to take all of your calls when we start the second hour here in just a few minutes.
[00:40:44.864 --> 00:40:45.625]  There's so much more.
[00:40:46.045 --> 00:40:46.786]  Obviously, I've not
[00:40:47.731 --> 00:40:47.991]  Got it.
[00:41:07.714 --> 00:41:09.395]  But it's still up there discounted right now.
[00:41:09.455 --> 00:41:17.001]  We also have the super silver tooth whitening and remineralization toothpaste that has the nano silver in it as well.
[00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:20.263]  Front line of defense, so good for your teeth, so good for your body.
[00:41:20.864 --> 00:41:24.747]  Even though this will sell out at current rates in about two weeks and more doesn't come in for over a month.
[00:41:25.327 --> 00:41:25.727]  I want you
[00:41:45.945 --> 00:41:53.149]  Super Silver whitening has the above ground coral calcium to re-memorize the teeth and high quality nano silver.
[00:41:53.169 --> 00:41:53.949]  It's fluoride free.
[00:41:54.189 --> 00:41:55.550]  Look at that 100% reviews.
[00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:56.991]  Infowarshore.com.
[00:41:57.931 --> 00:42:00.332]  So get yours today and support the InfoWar.
[00:42:00.392 --> 00:42:01.053]  And then finally...
[00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:04.313]  MyPatriots, the best storable foods company in the nation.
[00:42:04.373 --> 00:42:08.317]  It's the biggest now after 12 years because they deliver, they have high quality and taste tests.
[00:42:08.337 --> 00:42:09.738]  They're better than stuff you buy in stores.
[00:42:09.999 --> 00:42:12.281]  For about a third of the price, cutting out all the middlemen.
[00:42:12.301 --> 00:42:15.944]  There's not just one middleman, there's usually several there and it funds the info war.
[00:42:16.284 --> 00:42:18.266]  They are still able to ship within 10 to 14 days.
[00:42:18.286 --> 00:42:19.327]  They have plenty of food.
[00:42:19.888 --> 00:42:24.072]  The problem is shipping around the clock and packaging is their problem.
[00:42:24.392 --> 00:42:28.033]  Almost everybody else is sold out and or selling old food or gouging.
[00:42:28.073 --> 00:42:32.874]  So it's smart in 2020 to ask for storable food, whether it's four weeks, three months supply, six months supply.
[00:42:33.054 --> 00:42:33.894]  They have special diets.
[00:42:33.914 --> 00:42:34.854]  They have it all right there.
[00:42:35.214 --> 00:42:35.714]  I'd check it out.

[00:42:48.697 --> 00:42:49.997]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:42:50.797 --> 00:42:52.118]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:52.178 --> 00:42:54.159]  Trump is beginning to turn the tide against the globalists.
[00:42:54.179 --> 00:42:54.639]  That's great.
[00:42:56.059 --> 00:43:05.143]  And now we're going to be going to Trump rallies along with you and trying to get Trump to take action against big tech censorship now that the Justice Department announced they're not going to do anything.
[00:43:07.244 --> 00:43:08.665]  That's at least what they're
[00:43:10.515 --> 00:43:27.078]  Antitrust head said, this is a short segment so I want to air a special report here, and then when we come back in about five minutes I'm going to go to Sivash, I believe, Siavash from Finland, Justin, Tyler, Mitch, Mac, John, Jacob, Derek, Bill, and so many others.
[00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:29.799]  Trump is beginning to take action.
[00:43:29.819 --> 00:43:35.240]  It's very, very exciting, but the little poison lining of this beautiful cloud is that
[00:43:37.005 --> 00:43:39.667]  They're not going to go after the censorship, but we're still going to fight.
[00:43:39.727 --> 00:43:40.448]  We still have victory.
[00:43:41.709 --> 00:43:47.653]  There are those that live their lives in victimology, and that's a word that's in the encyclopedia, we all know.
[00:43:48.414 --> 00:43:56.821]  Instead of a new word, I'm about to coin into the realm and introduce today that could change the whole future of human destiny if it's adopted.
[00:43:57.801 --> 00:44:03.306]  And we've put a lot of key coins out in the mind war, the soul war, and the destiny war.
[00:44:04.126 --> 00:44:04.447]  And that's
[00:44:05.973 --> 00:44:06.814]  Victriology.
[00:44:11.697 --> 00:44:24.226]  So many people I know, so many people I love, define themselves by the attacks they're under, and define themselves by how they're victims, and, oh, look at me, I'm a baby bird!
[00:44:24.706 --> 00:44:26.688]  Come to the nest and vomit in my mouth!
[00:44:28.223 --> 00:44:29.384]  They never want to leave the nest.
[00:44:29.464 --> 00:44:31.225]  And the millennials don't own anything.
[00:44:31.585 --> 00:44:32.686]  They don't want to own anything.
[00:44:32.706 --> 00:44:33.707]  They want communism.
[00:44:33.987 --> 00:44:37.069]  They don't even know that communism will work them like slaves 18 hours a day.
[00:44:37.089 --> 00:44:41.352]  But they don't care because they're babies and we never pushed them out of the nest.
[00:44:43.453 --> 00:44:54.220]  And I have people that are close to me that I love who I just can't get out of the victimology because that's the paradigm inflicted on them.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.743]  So I am coining the term victriology.
[00:45:00.245 --> 00:45:05.847]  Instead of being a victim, be a victor.
[00:45:06.868 --> 00:45:09.909]  And to be a victor, you have to decide.
[00:45:10.129 --> 00:45:13.330]  If somebody punches you in the face, that don't feel too bad.
[00:45:14.151 --> 00:45:19.293]  You gotta stop caring when things are hard because that's what makes you stronger instead of weaker.
[00:45:20.526 --> 00:45:26.431]  Because it's that mental capacity to stop giving in to fear that activates the genes.
[00:45:26.992 --> 00:45:32.957]  That activates everything there is in your soul and your future and your destiny.
[00:45:33.818 --> 00:45:38.042]  Humans aren't born out of laying around on their asses!
[00:45:39.144 --> 00:45:48.615]  We've been born out of conquering a world with lions and tigers and bears and mastodons and hyenas attacking us!
[00:45:49.516 --> 00:45:56.865]  And hordes of other humans and giant wars and freezing atmospheres and giant volcanoes!
[00:45:57.706 --> 00:46:01.890]  And huddling together in the cold night for warmth to survive!
[00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:03.871]  We're the dominant species!
[00:46:04.151 --> 00:46:05.372]  We built all this!
[00:46:05.653 --> 00:46:06.653]  We're powerful!
[00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:07.894]  And we're beautiful!
[00:46:08.255 --> 00:46:12.058]  And we're ready to build the next level of civilization in God's plan.
[00:46:13.259 --> 00:46:17.402]  But you must stop battling to those who want to make you a victim.
[00:46:18.283 --> 00:46:21.706]  You must become the victor that you were born to be.
[00:46:21.726 --> 00:46:25.809]  And not a victor over other weaker people.
[00:46:27.128 --> 00:46:47.479]  But a victor in promoting ideas so powerful and so beautiful that despite the fact they're suppressed, it doesn't matter if they're coming from Jimi Hendrix, it doesn't matter if they're coming from Donald Trump, it doesn't matter if it's coming from you, a black man or a white woman or a young Hispanic person or somebody from China.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.642]  If you love God and you love justice and you love freedom,
[00:46:52.282 --> 00:46:53.984]  And you want to build a pro-human future?
[00:46:54.164 --> 00:47:00.769]  Then you are an enemy of the New World Order and Satanism, and you are an info-warrior committed!
[00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:07.795]  Devil worship and the system and serving the corrupt technocracy will not animate you like this.
[00:47:08.516 --> 00:47:11.418]  They want us shut down because we have the spirit.
[00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:13.660]  I'm jacked into the source.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.863]  I know the secret, and I want to see you empowered.
[00:47:17.803 --> 00:47:19.744]  But you have to believe in yourself first.
[00:47:20.505 --> 00:47:25.107]  And you have to turn against the globalists and make that decision with God to open your heart to the truth.
[00:47:25.667 --> 00:47:29.989]  And then, the spirit of justice, known as the Holy Spirit, will flow into you.
[00:47:30.409 --> 00:47:36.993]  And the beginning of a new system in your personal spiritual destiny with eternity will begin.
[00:47:38.153 --> 00:47:39.234]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:44.918 --> 00:47:49.699]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, on this live Wednesday, February 12, 2020, Global Transmission.
[00:47:50.259 --> 00:47:51.820]  We've entered hour number two.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.641]  Trump has launched the red storm.
[00:47:55.041 --> 00:47:57.801]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of firings.
[00:47:58.302 --> 00:48:07.564]  They're whining, they're complaining, they've got their little boxes waddling out of the federal government, the National Security Council, the State Department, the Justice Department.
[00:48:08.732 --> 00:48:11.654]  They were leakers, they were liars, they were America haters.
[00:48:12.455 --> 00:48:14.737]  And now finally Trump is becoming president.
[00:48:16.078 --> 00:48:20.341]  With only 264 days left until the historic election.
[00:48:23.484 --> 00:48:24.925]  We were worried he wouldn't take action.
[00:48:26.366 --> 00:48:27.347]  But now he is.
[00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:34.933]  Alright, Siavash in Finland.
[00:48:35.253 --> 00:48:36.014]  Thanks for calling.
[00:48:36.034 --> 00:48:37.234]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:48:37.275 --> 00:48:37.575]  Thank you.
[00:48:39.454 --> 00:48:40.695]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:48:42.296 --> 00:48:51.661]  If I may plug first, I was thinking about one of your products that I've been using for myself for a while, and it's been quite amazing.
[00:48:52.521 --> 00:48:53.342]  It's BODYEZ.
[00:48:54.342 --> 00:49:03.507]  And I destroyed basically one of my wrists at my, what's it called, training martial arts practice.
[00:49:03.587 --> 00:49:05.328]  You did martial arts and hurt your wrist?
[00:49:07.907 --> 00:49:11.228]  Yeah, and your body was amazing.
[00:49:11.408 --> 00:49:31.375]  I recovered within three weeks and my mom was recently diagnosed with arthritis and she's been having knee pains for years and your body was just amazing and she told me very recently that she simply doesn't feel pain anymore in her knees.
[00:49:31.615 --> 00:49:35.257]  I mean it doesn't feel as good as new but it doesn't feel painful either.
[00:49:37.052 --> 00:49:40.016]  He just got rid of all of that and I really want to thank you.
[00:49:52.279 --> 00:49:59.246]  And she goes, wait a minute, these turmeric pills are like twice as big and strong as yours, but yours works better.
[00:49:59.266 --> 00:50:08.436]  And I said, honey, because the FDA makes you just call it turmeric, we have an expensive turmeric extract, the strongest one that we could find that's certified.
[00:50:08.877 --> 00:50:11.840]  So it says turmeric on the bottle, but it's not turmeric.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.402]  It's a turmeric curcuminoid extract.
[00:50:15.043 --> 00:50:17.544]  And so that's why bodies, it works really good.
[00:50:17.804 --> 00:50:19.445]  And turmeric in general is amazing.
[00:50:19.765 --> 00:50:23.447]  But the average turmeric out there has 5% curcuminoid.
[00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:23.867]  This has 95%.
[00:50:25.028 --> 00:50:28.349]  This is the strongest curcuminoid we can find.
[00:50:28.389 --> 00:50:30.970]  In fact, this is a top company puts this out for us.
[00:50:31.451 --> 00:50:34.192]  They said we don't know anyone else that puts one out this strong.
[00:50:34.532 --> 00:50:35.973]  So they specially make it.
[00:50:36.837 --> 00:50:37.738]  The other highest was like 87%.
[00:50:38.979 --> 00:50:40.421]  Another company puts out 87%.
[00:50:40.942 --> 00:50:44.406]  This extracts 95% curcuminoids.
[00:50:44.426 --> 00:50:45.727]  So that's why it has such a big effect.
[00:50:45.747 --> 00:50:48.090]  So I'm glad you and your mother have liked it.
[00:50:50.245 --> 00:50:51.667]  Yeah, most definitely.
[00:50:52.648 --> 00:50:54.750]  All of your other products are very amazing.
[00:50:54.810 --> 00:51:02.078]  For the first time, I bought your Creole Oil and I really have to tell you, my mental clarity is just insane.
[00:51:02.539 --> 00:51:07.004]  And I've been sleeping so much better, just like you've been saying that you can't get out of bed.
[00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:08.445]  It's exactly like that.
[00:51:08.586 --> 00:51:09.767]  I really like it.
[00:51:09.847 --> 00:51:10.788]  Most definitely, I'm going
[00:51:10.868 --> 00:51:12.029]  Oh, it's definitely scary.
[00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:15.330]  We're sold out of the krill oil right now, but our ultimate fish oil is Park Krill Oil.
[00:51:15.791 --> 00:51:17.772]  And I'll just be honest, it's different strokes for different folks.
[00:51:17.792 --> 00:51:18.412]  It's a higher dose.
[00:51:18.432 --> 00:51:19.713]  The krill oil's better for me.
[00:51:20.213 --> 00:51:23.635]  But yeah, if I want to have fun, I'll take three krill oil and go to sleep.
[00:51:24.235 --> 00:51:26.356]  And then it's just, it's crazy.
[00:51:26.916 --> 00:51:28.097]  And then I forget to take it.
[00:51:28.117 --> 00:51:30.318]  I'm like, why aren't I taking this constantly?
[00:51:30.378 --> 00:51:32.459]  Because it just makes life so much better.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.581]  It also thins the blood.
[00:51:35.641 --> 00:51:36.621]  It also thins the blood.
[00:51:37.022 --> 00:51:39.643]  Which again, is so critical to not having heart attacks, as everybody knows.
[00:51:41.545 --> 00:51:41.885]  Oh yeah.
[00:51:42.246 --> 00:51:45.448]  I mean, it's better to take supplements the older you get.
[00:51:45.628 --> 00:51:48.130]  Just take care of your body and expect good things.
[00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:51.493]  If you don't take care of your body, you can't really expect anything good out of your body.
[00:51:51.733 --> 00:51:52.994]  Well, you're up there in Finland.
[00:51:53.234 --> 00:51:58.138]  That's actually where... That's where krill oil actually comes from.
[00:51:58.178 --> 00:52:02.402]  That's some of the cleanest, best krill and stuff is out of those fjords up there.
[00:52:04.537 --> 00:52:09.778]  Oh yeah, we have all of that stuff here, but it's unfortunately very hard to trust any good companies here.
[00:52:10.158 --> 00:52:15.859]  Like, the biggest companies that are out here that have the biggest exposure are the absolute worst companies.
[00:52:15.919 --> 00:52:17.999]  They put out the worst, worst stuff.
[00:52:18.079 --> 00:52:18.819]  Oh, I know, I know.
[00:52:18.899 --> 00:52:29.981]  I mean, they'll tell me, because I've talked to big companies, they'll do 90% of their money is in marketing instead of in the actual product, and then they'll just put out the lowest grade crap to people not caring.
[00:52:30.361 --> 00:52:31.862]  But again, that's what satanism's about.
[00:52:32.302 --> 00:52:33.462]  Like, I could not...
[00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:38.654]  Put out something that I thought wasn't the best.
[00:52:39.335 --> 00:52:41.217]  I mean, take the storeable food.
[00:52:41.317 --> 00:52:52.369]  Like I said, you can find stuff five times more expensive that tastes gourmet, but for the nexus of how much you spend versus the quality you get, this is the best stuff out there.
[00:52:53.243 --> 00:52:56.225]  But other than food, because you can definitely spend more money and get food that tastes better.
[00:52:56.526 --> 00:52:57.326]  I'm not going to lie to people.
[00:52:57.646 --> 00:52:58.947]  It's just not worth it.
[00:52:59.688 --> 00:53:01.910]  When it comes to supplements, we are bringing you the very best we can.
[00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.031]  But I'm going to stop belaboring it.
[00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:04.251]  Thank you for the plug, sir.
[00:53:04.292 --> 00:53:04.792]  God bless you.
[00:53:05.132 --> 00:53:07.154]  What is your view on Trump and the mass firings?
[00:53:09.059 --> 00:53:11.521]  Well, my view is what took so long?
[00:53:11.581 --> 00:53:15.663]  I mean, I'm glad that all of this happened right now, but what took so long?
[00:53:15.763 --> 00:53:32.374]  And the second is that I'm just thinking that he's going to now start going to go after all these criminal people like Hillary Clinton and Obama and all of these people that have been doing all of these things for years that they've been getting away with.
[00:53:33.204 --> 00:53:34.186]  What's going to happen with that?
[00:53:34.266 --> 00:53:37.169]  Is he going to finally start going after all of these people?
[00:53:38.351 --> 00:53:43.437]  You know, Trump acts tough, but he really is a pragmatist and doesn't want to destroy these people.
[00:53:43.737 --> 00:53:44.778]  He just wants them to go away.
[00:53:45.319 --> 00:53:48.343]  But every time I've been able to talk the president to the point of him being annoyed,
[00:53:48.823 --> 00:53:51.404]  I go, sir, I'm not bragging when I tell these stories.
[00:53:51.424 --> 00:53:52.324]  He knows these are true.
[00:53:52.364 --> 00:53:54.944]  I go, sir, please stop telling me how I'm a good, great guy.
[00:53:55.485 --> 00:53:57.005]  Just stop these people.
[00:53:57.025 --> 00:53:59.005]  They're trying to destroy me and my family and you.
[00:53:59.265 --> 00:54:00.546]  You must go on the attack.
[00:54:00.886 --> 00:54:02.046]  You must go on the attack.
[00:54:02.266 --> 00:54:03.186]  And now he's doing it.
[00:54:03.746 --> 00:54:05.467]  And so it's good news.
[00:54:05.527 --> 00:54:09.408]  He just can't believe that he's going to leave him alone when he can send them all to prison.
[00:54:09.668 --> 00:54:10.808]  But they don't respect him.
[00:54:10.868 --> 00:54:11.928]  They're going to respect him now.
[00:54:12.348 --> 00:54:14.829]  I believe he's getting really, really ready to go after him.
[00:54:17.182 --> 00:54:23.185]  Well, for a moment there, it seemed like he really doesn't see that these people are actually trying to remove him.
[00:54:23.205 --> 00:54:29.028]  It was really hard trying to work with them and make it actually work.
[00:54:29.108 --> 00:54:31.250]  But it's not going to happen.
[00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:35.732]  When people are simply corrupt, they're not just going to all of a sudden start working with you.
[00:54:35.752 --> 00:54:38.193]  If you've ever been around criminals, they're dumb.
[00:54:38.433 --> 00:54:39.854]  They have confidence, but they're dumb.
[00:54:39.934 --> 00:54:42.896]  And Trump saw how close he got to being impeached.
[00:54:43.556 --> 00:54:46.337]  And he knows they could win the Senate, so now he gets it finally.
[00:54:46.677 --> 00:54:49.259]  Him only a few votes away from being impeached?
[00:54:49.839 --> 00:54:52.100]  Almost had to have the Vice President come in and save his ass?
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.520]  In the tie vote?
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.861]  I mean, so yeah, Trump finally gets it.
[00:54:56.422 --> 00:54:58.262]  He's like, wait, doing a good job wasn't enough?
[00:54:58.643 --> 00:55:00.523]  They really don't want to share power?
[00:55:00.684 --> 00:55:00.904]  No!
[00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:02.144]  They don't want to share power!
[00:55:02.204 --> 00:55:03.765]  They want total control, Trump!
[00:55:07.108 --> 00:55:10.750]  I'm very happy to see that he's actually doing something now.
[00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:18.935]  This is the very first step, at least, that he's going to take towards these people, and it's going to scare the living daylights out of them.
[00:55:18.955 --> 00:55:20.295]  I agree with you.
[00:55:20.335 --> 00:55:21.176]  What do you think they do next?
[00:55:23.597 --> 00:55:32.402]  Well, they're going to go into full panic mode, and they're going to try and pull something out of their hat, and it's not going to be pretty, and it's going to be
[00:55:33.547 --> 00:55:37.488]  Probably something very unexpected, but I really honestly can't say.
[00:55:38.908 --> 00:55:50.171]  I love Pelosi saying it's political interference to say I think this sentence is too big when he has the executive power to pardon people.
[00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:55.152]  He 100% has that power, but they just don't want him to have the basic power of a president.
[00:55:55.453 --> 00:55:56.113]  God bless you, sir.
[00:55:56.173 --> 00:55:56.873]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:58.226 --> 00:56:04.429]  All right, I got a minute before break, so I can't do justice to a caller, but let's do three callers next segment.
[00:56:04.449 --> 00:56:06.189]  Let's get a lot of callers, because they're all amazing.
[00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:08.110]  But separately, yeah.
[00:56:09.251 --> 00:56:12.932]  Why wouldn't I want to put out a turmeric formula that gives you the best response?
[00:56:15.654 --> 00:56:22.436]  Because I love that when my wife came to me and she said, I take one of these, it does the same as three of these.
[00:56:23.137 --> 00:56:23.697]  Why is that?
[00:56:23.717 --> 00:56:25.498]  Because it says it's lower turmeric on ours.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.123]  And I explained to her, I said, baby, they don't let you say turmeric extract.
[00:56:30.143 --> 00:56:33.285]  You just call it turmeric on the back, but it's turmeric extract.
[00:56:33.325 --> 00:56:37.649]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, Ultimate Turmeric Formula Bodies, and that helps.
[00:56:38.229 --> 00:56:39.350]  By the way, that's sold out, though.
[00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:40.551]  We're like up here.
[00:56:41.972 --> 00:56:43.854]  We're up here plucking something sold out.
[00:56:46.676 --> 00:56:48.757]  Because we have to get the purest in, too.
[00:56:48.777 --> 00:56:50.299]  It has to pass all the testing.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.342]  And they've not been able to even get turmeric clean enough to even make a run of it.
[00:56:55.481 --> 00:56:59.562]  Again, that's why we don't cut corners to get you the quality, but it means stuff's sold out sometimes.
[00:57:00.022 --> 00:57:06.283]  What we do have is a super blue and the super silver whitening toothpaste with a nano silver that will sell out soon.
[00:57:06.323 --> 00:57:07.383]  That funds the operation.
[00:57:07.703 --> 00:57:08.703]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:08.743 --> 00:57:10.023]  All right, enough plugging for the hour.
[00:57:10.083 --> 00:57:10.564]  I'm done!
[00:57:11.384 --> 00:57:13.064]  Callers, no more plugging products.
[00:57:13.544 --> 00:57:16.405]  We're going to go to your politics, your worldview straight ahead.
[00:57:17.545 --> 00:57:20.005]  So, the red storm is here.
[00:57:20.145 --> 00:57:22.366]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of firings.
[00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:24.426]  A lot of them delicious.
[00:57:26.243 --> 00:57:28.604]  Trump withdraws nomination of former U.S.
[00:57:28.644 --> 00:57:30.484]  Attorney for Treasury Post.
[00:57:30.924 --> 00:57:46.729]  Trump's now paying attention to how his own staff brings in people like the fake prosecutor over stone who engage in all those incredible activities that investigated myself, my father, that leaked information to the press to harass us.
[00:57:47.369 --> 00:57:49.350]  This monster, this un-American pig,
[00:57:52.193 --> 00:57:56.595]  Oversaw various high-profile cases, including those against Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone.
[00:57:57.936 --> 00:58:00.677]  Well, they gave her the nomination for number three of the Treasury.
[00:58:00.997 --> 00:58:03.478]  She quit her Justice Department job for it.
[00:58:03.978 --> 00:58:04.759]  And then guess what?
[00:58:05.499 --> 00:58:07.300]  The nomination was withdrawn.
[00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:10.867]  Isn't that just perfect?
[00:58:12.569 --> 00:58:16.352]  And, of course, that's the way all of this ends up unfolding.
[00:58:16.412 --> 00:58:20.034]  Jesse Lew, we're taking your phone calls right now.
[00:58:20.695 --> 00:58:22.516]  Let's go ahead and go to Bill in Iowa.
[00:58:22.536 --> 00:58:23.297]  Bill, you're on the air.
[00:58:23.337 --> 00:58:23.917]  Thanks for calling.
[00:58:23.937 --> 00:58:25.799]  Yeah.
[00:58:25.859 --> 00:58:26.259]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[00:58:26.299 --> 00:58:27.000]  Can you hear me?
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:27.740]  I can, brother.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.361]  Thanks for calling.
[00:58:29.462 --> 00:58:29.762]  Great.
[00:58:29.822 --> 00:58:30.182]  Thank you.
[00:58:30.262 --> 00:58:35.887]  I want to first of all say, long-time listener, first-time caller, you've woken me up in so many ways.
[00:58:37.056 --> 00:58:41.078]  Because of you I got my patriotism back, love my country, would die for it.
[00:58:42.598 --> 00:58:46.780]  I think it's good right now what Trump is doing is getting rid of all the little scumbags there.
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:56.103]  I think what he really needs to do is start getting the military police involved and just have one big sweep get rid of all these corrupt people.
[00:58:57.163 --> 00:59:01.705]  The downside of that is, you know, when you have a rapid raccoon, you know, cornered in
[00:59:02.446 --> 00:59:03.247]  No, I agree with you.
[00:59:22.878 --> 00:59:28.479]  The globalists know that they're running out of time, and they are going to pull some major curveballs.
[00:59:29.059 --> 00:59:30.360]  And Trump should be aware of that.
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:31.840]  And it's not like he wants to stir up trouble.
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:36.741]  They're not going to stop because they were put in power by other people.
[00:59:36.801 --> 00:59:37.681]  These are minions.
[00:59:37.721 --> 00:59:38.682]  These are followers.
[00:59:39.082 --> 00:59:44.963]  And so they can't help but work against Trump because they were put there because there's dirt on them.
[00:59:45.483 --> 00:59:47.944]  And so that's why Trump can do nothing but cut them out.
[00:59:48.564 --> 00:59:53.906]  Right, and I agree, you know, and as far as this censorship with the big tech companies and everything like that, Trump doesn't do nothing right now.
[01:00:11.892 --> 01:00:15.514]  There's a good chance that he might not be president again if they don't take him out before then, you know?
[01:00:15.534 --> 01:00:25.118]  Well, that's exactly what Professor Epstein, Robert Epstein, documented is that Google can only send out election alerts to Democrats.
[01:00:25.278 --> 01:00:27.799]  That's another 10, 15, 20 million voters right there.
[01:00:28.219 --> 01:00:29.319]  This is election meddling.
[01:00:29.339 --> 01:00:31.460]  This isn't, oh, companies do what they want.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:35.962]  What if AT&T in 1980 wouldn't let Republicans use the phone?
[01:00:36.062 --> 01:00:37.583]  I mean, Reagan would have lost.
[01:00:38.223 --> 01:00:39.424]  That's what they do!
[01:00:40.124 --> 01:00:42.186]  This isn't about companies can do what they want.
[01:00:42.486 --> 01:00:44.167]  This is the new mode of communication.
[01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:54.274]  Problem is, it's a good thing in ways, because you know, he's got some old instincts, but Trump does all his stuff on a phone and doesn't get the internet.
[01:00:54.294 --> 01:00:55.895]  He still thinks it's like a side thing.
[01:00:56.495 --> 01:01:00.498]  He doesn't know that the internet communication is 20 times bigger than mainstream media.
[01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:03.820]  He just doesn't get that it's the whole ballgame.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.641]  And so it's a real blind spot.
[01:01:05.681 --> 01:01:06.462]  Thank you so much, Bill.
[01:01:07.438 --> 01:01:09.440]  Derek in California, thanks for holding.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.341]  We'll go to Jacob and others.
[01:01:10.381 --> 01:01:10.921]  Derek, thank you.
[01:01:10.941 --> 01:01:11.222]  Go ahead.
[01:01:12.022 --> 01:01:12.503]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:12.523 --> 01:01:14.324]  Nice to hear from you, Alex.
[01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:16.406]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:16.426 --> 01:01:18.628]  I just want to say that I agree with the caller.
[01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:21.931]  I think it's time to put the military in here.
[01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:24.254]  I think it's time to just go ahead and get it going.
[01:01:25.395 --> 01:01:29.518]  You know, we can't deal with these people in the court system.
[01:01:29.598 --> 01:01:32.141]  We just went through what Trump just went through with the
[01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:34.147]  You know, there's no escape.
[01:01:34.167 --> 01:01:35.468]  And you know they're not going to stop.
[01:01:36.348 --> 01:01:36.749]  Here's the deal.
[01:01:36.769 --> 01:01:38.009]  There were Americans doing it.
[01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.870]  It's one thing.
[01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:40.891]  But they are CHICOM and Globalist funded.
[01:01:41.312 --> 01:01:43.633]  As an ethos, they say America shouldn't exist.
[01:01:44.013 --> 01:01:55.962]  So when you're a citizen that says the country shouldn't exist, and you're working to bankrupt it, and you're working to suppress other people, and all these Bernie Sanders people say they want to put us in death camps, yeah, they're like the Nazi Party.
[01:01:55.982 --> 01:01:56.842]  You just outlaw it.
[01:01:57.042 --> 01:01:57.923]  I mean, because listen.
[01:01:58.183 --> 01:01:59.944]  I'm not an authoritarian, I'm the opposite of that.
[01:02:00.304 --> 01:02:07.249]  They brought the authoritarianism, they brought the cancer, they brought the war, they brought... And you're right, these aren't Americans!
[01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:13.693]  And so how do you address something with normal means, normal measures, when it's not normal?
[01:02:15.014 --> 01:02:17.115]  Well, they already committed treason here.
[01:02:17.876 --> 01:02:18.997]  We're past that.
[01:02:19.557 --> 01:02:20.798]  You know, from Obama...
[01:02:21.497 --> 01:02:22.600]  All the way up to Hillary.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.584]  These people have committed treason.
[01:02:25.066 --> 01:02:28.032]  And we can't go to the courts and try these people.
[01:02:28.253 --> 01:02:29.756]  We need military tribunal.
[01:02:30.506 --> 01:02:31.126]  Plain and simple.
[01:02:55.675 --> 01:03:00.537]  And part of the reason why I say that is because a lot of people have suffered.
[01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.418]  I've been suffering ever since Obama.
[01:03:02.818 --> 01:03:12.943]  I didn't vote for the cat, because I've seen him coming out the gate from people like you and a couple other people I used to listen to, and just from doing my basic research, I knew he wasn't no good.
[01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:15.424]  And I'm a black African-American, okay?
[01:03:16.244 --> 01:03:18.105]  You know, I'm a former person.
[01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:20.186]  I used to be in a church, used to be an elder, all that.
[01:03:20.266 --> 01:03:23.608]  I walked away from that because I've seen the bias
[01:03:24.221 --> 01:03:25.482]  That I was surrounded by.
[01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:28.143]  You know, this man was not a Christian.
[01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:35.648]  When he was at Saddleback Church here in California, he talked bad about the father of faith of Abraham.
[01:03:36.108 --> 01:03:36.468]  Okay?
[01:03:36.768 --> 01:03:38.109]  And that means you're not a Christian.
[01:03:38.289 --> 01:03:39.470]  You don't want nothing to do with it.
[01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.951]  But I digress.
[01:03:41.531 --> 01:03:46.834]  But one thing that people are failing to understand is we are here at that point.
[01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:53.597]  And what Trump's need to stop doing is running a presidency like he's sitting in his office running one of his companies.
[01:03:54.078 --> 01:03:55.199]  This is reality, buddy.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.285]  And I know he's in a hell of a position, and I take my hats off to him.
[01:03:59.806 --> 01:04:02.309]  He's got some balls sitting on a skateboard.
[01:04:02.887 --> 01:04:04.849]  You know, just to get up there and do what he's doing.
[01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:07.993]  No, you're right, but now he's in that game, and you're right.
[01:04:08.453 --> 01:04:22.829]  We've exposed him, we've made them show their fangs, they openly want to destroy the country, and the Democrats are involved in election fraud everywhere, trying to get illegal aliens registered to vote, and so you're right, a regular political response is not the response to this.
[01:04:23.547 --> 01:04:28.849]  I mean, I hate to go back to Hitler, but it's like Hitler attacks you, you don't have political responses to that, you have military responses.
[01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:34.711]  And we've seen a, the globalist operation is military, it's not political.
[01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:38.732]  Well, you can't, you gotta fight fire with fire here.
[01:04:38.752 --> 01:04:39.793]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:39.833 --> 01:04:41.733]  You can't use no fire extinguisher over here.
[01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:42.954]  We got a diesel fire.
[01:04:43.014 --> 01:04:44.974]  There's special stuff we gotta use over here.
[01:04:45.374 --> 01:04:46.235]  And we have that.
[01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:48.335]  We need to let the Marines loose.
[01:04:48.716 --> 01:04:50.856]  Obama and Hillary pissed the Marines off.
[01:04:51.376 --> 01:04:52.097]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:52.397 --> 01:04:52.937]  Let them loose!
[01:04:53.806 --> 01:04:55.952]  You know, it's time for some redemption around here.
[01:04:55.972 --> 01:04:57.515]  You know?
[01:04:57.555 --> 01:05:00.122]  We're sitting here as, am I a Trump supporter?
[01:05:00.202 --> 01:05:01.566]  Being black, I'll say it again.
[01:05:02.409 --> 01:05:04.250]  I'm suffering over here financially.
[01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:05.431]  You know what I mean?
[01:05:05.451 --> 01:05:05.991]  No, you're right.
[01:05:06.732 --> 01:05:12.575]  And they're literally trying to bring the country down and bankrupt it and telling us that and trying to make us all kill each other.
[01:05:13.095 --> 01:05:13.916]  You're absolutely right.
[01:05:13.996 --> 01:05:17.698]  I mean, instead of the Marines, if Trump's going to do it, he needs covert action.
[01:05:18.118 --> 01:05:20.660]  All he's got to do is the top leadership of the globalists.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.762]  Maybe 20 people, they all die in kayak accidents this week.
[01:05:24.622 --> 01:05:26.143]  And they'll stop right, cut the head off.
[01:05:26.743 --> 01:05:30.505]  And I'm not going to do that myself, but I would support covert action.
[01:05:30.565 --> 01:05:32.185]  I would, I would support the president.
[01:05:32.645 --> 01:05:36.247]  Anybody that's taking Chi-Com money, send in the teams and kill them.
[01:05:37.487 --> 01:05:39.448]  But can you trust the people that will actually do that?
[01:05:39.928 --> 01:05:41.529]  There's people that can be trusted to carry it out.
[01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:43.370]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:46.631]  We are back, taking your phone calls right now.
[01:05:50.653 --> 01:05:52.874]  It's very positive to see Trump taking action.
[01:05:54.949 --> 01:05:57.130]  And they have totally paralyzed the president.
[01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:59.830]  The idea that he can't pardon Roger Stone.
[01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:03.011]  The idea that he can't say, I want to fight corruption in Ukraine.
[01:06:03.031 --> 01:06:04.072]  That's the federal law.
[01:06:04.452 --> 01:06:07.613]  If he's giving money to that country, taxpayer money, he has to do that.
[01:06:08.273 --> 01:06:13.394]  He just needs to stop caring what these lawyers and scumbags tell him.
[01:06:13.434 --> 01:06:20.637]  And as long as he knows he's doing the right thing, as long as we don't politically disagree with him, he has our backing.
[01:06:20.697 --> 01:06:21.577]  That's how it works.
[01:06:23.763 --> 01:06:28.645]  But as sure as the sun came up this morning, they're going to steal that election in 264 days.
[01:06:30.105 --> 01:06:32.046]  You've already seen them pull out every stop they've got.
[01:06:32.066 --> 01:06:40.569]  You've already seen them stealing stuff from Sanders, who I can't stand, but he's popular with the Democrats.
[01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:43.830]  So he doesn't have a choice.
[01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:49.432]  They're going to destroy him just like the sun came up this morning, as I said, if he doesn't take action.
[01:06:49.492 --> 01:06:52.313]  And look, I'm not somebody that wants to hear about direct action.
[01:06:53.717 --> 01:06:55.318]  Covert, kill teams, and the rest of this.
[01:06:56.038 --> 01:06:58.179]  But the globalists are shipping MS-13 in.
[01:06:58.199 --> 01:07:01.200]  They're giving illegal aliens voter registration cards and driver's licenses.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.702]  They're openly trying to foment race war for no reason when Trump's trying to create unity.
[01:07:06.242 --> 01:07:09.203]  Letting that happen is allowing violence to take place.
[01:07:10.044 --> 01:07:10.904]  So I'm not a coward.
[01:07:14.028 --> 01:07:20.036]  And we entered the wheelhouse of violence a long time ago, but we're winning with ideas and political moves.
[01:07:20.356 --> 01:07:24.962]  So I just say, like Gandhi would say, or Martin Luther King Jr., take it on the chin.
[01:07:24.982 --> 01:07:30.670]  If we were losing, I'd say, okay, we got a 1776.
[01:07:32.639 --> 01:07:33.479]  We gotta get the guns.
[01:07:33.999 --> 01:07:35.079]  But we're winning.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:45.321]  So if I gotta take it on the chin, or if we gotta go through a lot of pain to not give them what they want, they're desperately trying to get violence right now because they're losing their ass.
[01:07:51.382 --> 01:07:54.123]  That said though, I don't just say this stuff.
[01:07:54.543 --> 01:07:56.983]  People notice like stuff I said 20 years ago is now all over the news.
[01:07:58.564 --> 01:08:00.064]  It's not that China's all powerful.
[01:08:01.624 --> 01:08:07.726]  China, 70 years ago at the end of World War II, was 97% rural.
[01:08:08.987 --> 01:08:11.007]  Maybe 2% of them had electricity.
[01:08:11.428 --> 01:08:13.008]  Maybe 10% had running water.
[01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:18.650]  And now they've got more industry than we do.
[01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:22.211]  That was because globalists made deals to build them up artificially.
[01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:23.812]  Because globalists own China.
[01:08:24.472 --> 01:08:26.293]  So that was their own investment going straight up.
[01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:43.921]  That said, anybody that is in bed with the Chai-coms, once they got more arrogant in the last 20 years or so, they make you put one of their officers in your company.
[01:08:47.922 --> 01:08:57.684]  And so anybody that's got a Chinese intelligence agency operative in their deal, we don't need to sit there and let that damage the economy.
[01:09:00.396 --> 01:09:02.017]  Let's just talk about what you actually do.
[01:09:02.057 --> 01:09:03.437]  We kill the Chinese agents.
[01:09:04.078 --> 01:09:04.478]  Not me.
[01:09:04.518 --> 01:09:05.518]  I'm talking about Trump.
[01:09:05.978 --> 01:09:07.359]  Needs to have the military go kill him.
[01:09:07.619 --> 01:09:08.739]  That's what you're supposed to do, okay?
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:09.680]  Just kill him.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.281]  This is not acting tough.
[01:09:11.341 --> 01:09:12.581]  It's not, oh, I'm a big man guy.
[01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:13.662]  That's the default.
[01:09:13.902 --> 01:09:18.203]  You got a foreign intelligence operative inside the Senate, inside the House, inside a U.S.
[01:09:18.223 --> 01:09:18.744]  corporation.
[01:09:19.024 --> 01:09:19.424]  Kill him!
[01:09:20.564 --> 01:09:21.625]  My God, it's not a big deal.
[01:09:22.861 --> 01:09:25.362]  Go grab them out of their house at night and slit their damn throat.
[01:09:25.683 --> 01:09:26.563]  What you supposed to do?
[01:09:27.403 --> 01:09:28.484]  Stop playing games here.
[01:09:28.924 --> 01:09:30.605]  Kill the Chinese agents now.
[01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:31.926]  Let's start there.
[01:09:32.326 --> 01:09:37.049]  And all these Democrats will roll over like that as soon as their handler's dead.
[01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:40.250]  Kill the foreign agents now, Trump.
[01:09:41.891 --> 01:09:43.652]  And I know you've got the people ready to do it.
[01:09:43.752 --> 01:09:48.995]  And don't be scared that, oh, they'll leak it to the media and then everyone's going to back you.
[01:09:50.213 --> 01:09:50.553]  Kill them?
[01:09:50.813 --> 01:09:51.354]  Kill them now.
[01:09:52.294 --> 01:09:52.834]  It's very simple.
[01:09:54.415 --> 01:09:54.795]  Do it!
[01:09:57.277 --> 01:09:59.378]  You know they've been killing our people over there for no reason.
[01:09:59.878 --> 01:10:01.899]  And killing Christian adoption groups and things.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:02.940]  No more!
[01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:05.481]  Kill them!
[01:10:05.982 --> 01:10:06.462]  Kill them now.
[01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:09.964]  Let's just start there.
[01:10:10.184 --> 01:10:11.044]  Let's just start there.
[01:10:11.725 --> 01:10:13.666]  And you watch the Democrats in the deep state.
[01:10:14.206 --> 01:10:14.786]  Yellow bellies.
[01:10:14.946 --> 01:10:17.067]  As soon as their controllers are all dead.
[01:10:18.008 --> 01:10:19.189]  Let's stop playing games.
[01:10:20.879 --> 01:10:21.800]  That's so easy.
[01:10:22.941 --> 01:10:24.303]  It's so easy.
[01:10:24.363 --> 01:10:25.524]  It's like pumpkin pie, man.
[01:10:25.544 --> 01:10:27.826]  It's like eating a piece of pumpkin pie with whipped cream on top.
[01:10:28.287 --> 01:10:34.333]  This is not hard to do, and it needs to be done, and America needs to stop rolling over to this BS.
[01:10:38.998 --> 01:10:40.319]  But it feels good saying that, doesn't it?
[01:10:40.359 --> 01:10:41.961]  Because that's what we're supposed to do.
[01:10:43.066 --> 01:10:48.088]  Let's not talk about tribunals, the Marines, and some big battle with the Deep State up front.
[01:10:48.348 --> 01:10:49.929]  Let's have a battle they never knew hit them.
[01:10:50.449 --> 01:10:55.272]  Because believe me, you turn loose the U.S.
[01:10:55.312 --> 01:11:01.534]  military on known Chinese agents inside the United States, it's legal, it's lawful, they're involved in espionage in our country.
[01:11:03.795 --> 01:11:09.478]  We're not going to have trials or big long events or a bunch of crying about it or wringing our hands.
[01:11:13.922 --> 01:11:15.243]  You do what the CHICOMS do.
[01:11:15.343 --> 01:11:17.304]  If they catch US agents over there, they kill them.
[01:11:17.864 --> 01:11:18.665]  So it's tit for tat.
[01:11:18.865 --> 01:11:19.365]  Oh, really?
[01:11:20.025 --> 01:11:22.607]  So you've caught operatives that aren't under your control.
[01:11:23.227 --> 01:11:30.651]  And Obama gave them the whole Office of Personnel Management hack to know who's who and who they can roll over and who they can... They've infiltrated us.
[01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:31.972]  They've overrun us.
[01:11:37.998 --> 01:11:40.799]  And so, push the lawyers out of this discussion.
[01:11:41.139 --> 01:11:43.980]  Because the lawyers will lose this country for us real fast.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.860]  Lawyers didn't start this country.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.881]  Lawyers didn't win World War II.
[01:11:48.301 --> 01:11:49.261]  They didn't win the War of 1812.
[01:11:50.041 --> 01:11:52.502]  They won't do anything but lose the country.
[01:11:56.663 --> 01:11:57.924]  Now is the time to kill!
[01:11:58.864 --> 01:12:01.244]  And to have the killer instinct, and to stop worrying about it!
[01:12:01.665 --> 01:12:02.805]  Chai comms came here,
[01:12:04.042 --> 01:12:06.364]  They expect to overrun us and defeat us.
[01:12:06.724 --> 01:12:07.744]  Instead, they die.
[01:12:07.764 --> 01:12:10.546]  Now, I'm going to stop talking about that and go to your phone calls.
[01:12:11.087 --> 01:12:12.848]  Joseph in Ireland, thanks for holding.
[01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:14.509]  Joseph, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:12:14.529 --> 01:12:14.909]  Go ahead.
[01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:16.210]  Hi, Alex.
[01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.650]  How are you?
[01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:17.671]  I'm all right, brother.
[01:12:17.691 --> 01:12:18.131]  What are you making?
[01:12:18.151 --> 01:12:18.652]  What's happening?
[01:12:19.692 --> 01:12:26.537]  Well, first of all, my gut feeling was this coronavirus is man-made, and I think you've proven it.
[01:12:27.157 --> 01:12:29.479]  But I believe there's much worse to come.
[01:12:30.359 --> 01:12:33.841]  Whether it was accidentally released or deliberately, it doesn't matter.
[01:12:33.861 --> 01:12:34.741]  It's part of their plan.
[01:12:34.801 --> 01:12:35.802]  They're plowing on.
[01:12:36.422 --> 01:12:39.424]  And I also believe the locusts in East Africa are a manned weapon.
[01:12:40.144 --> 01:12:42.885]  And I believe the locusts to come will be much worse.
[01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:54.912]  They will actually attack people, like an evil intent, because this is... They're wiping out the population, preparing us for World War III, but they don't want a big population around when the Third World War happens, or much reduced.
[01:12:56.192 --> 01:12:57.673]  And it doesn't matter.
[01:12:57.693 --> 01:12:58.413]  They've got a plan.
[01:12:58.433 --> 01:12:59.334]  They're plowing on.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:07.525]  Trump is in the way but, you know, they'll keep attacking him and hopefully one punch will bring him down.
[01:13:07.845 --> 01:13:08.866]  What do you make of him?
[01:13:09.046 --> 01:13:11.107]  What should he do to the Chinese dragon right now?
[01:13:11.127 --> 01:13:12.588]  I mean, I say stomp its guts out.
[01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:21.574]  Well, I believe, you see, the problem is he's got so many inside that it's leaking out and he can't do anything covert.
[01:13:22.194 --> 01:13:27.758]  So, launch on the Democrats legally, like I was just thinking there while you were talking,
[01:13:28.786 --> 01:13:37.934]  All the families of the victims of the sanctuary cities launch a huge law case against the Democrats for the murder of their relatives, backed by the state.
[01:13:37.974 --> 01:13:39.435]  I don't know whether they, something like that.
[01:13:39.475 --> 01:13:40.296]  Some big case.
[01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:44.359]  Launch a huge investigation into their election fraud.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:45.720]  No, I agree.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:47.662]  Whatever he does, he's got to go on the offense.
[01:13:47.702 --> 01:13:48.402]  Thank you, Joseph.
[01:13:48.823 --> 01:13:53.126]  Jacob, John, Maverick, Mitch, Tyler, Justin, Sam, James, your calls.
[01:13:53.166 --> 01:13:54.467]  I'm going to shut up when we come back.
[01:13:55.285 --> 01:13:56.306]  We're gonna take calls.
[01:13:56.326 --> 01:14:03.091]  Do you think the CHICOMS would let their operatives be controlled by the United States so they'd never put up with it?
[01:14:04.452 --> 01:14:05.032]  We'll be right back.
[01:14:06.673 --> 01:14:07.594]  We knew this was coming.
[01:14:07.894 --> 01:14:10.136]  I talked about this intensely in the first hour.
[01:14:10.856 --> 01:14:11.617]  How big tech.
[01:14:13.223 --> 01:14:15.826]  Can control what words you can use and plans to.
[01:14:16.807 --> 01:14:20.432]  Siri is now not letting you say the word gun.
[01:14:20.452 --> 01:14:22.734]  It's an InfoWars.com article.
[01:14:23.495 --> 01:14:26.999]  You know it's some substrata test of only so many users.
[01:14:28.012 --> 01:14:33.037]  Apple's Siri voice assistant is now apparently refusing to say the word gun when used on an iPad.
[01:14:33.577 --> 01:14:42.686]  Tracy Connors tweeted a video of herself attempting to have Siri read out a Daily Caller headline entitled, Virginia House of Delegates Passes Gun Ban Seizure Bill.
[01:14:42.766 --> 01:14:43.507]  Would not do it.
[01:14:43.687 --> 01:14:44.748]  I tried it during the break.
[01:14:44.948 --> 01:14:45.889]  Would not do it as well.
[01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:52.430]  How could you attack words and language unless you have A.I.
[01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:53.450]  in place?
[01:14:53.971 --> 01:14:55.892]  This isn't just about election meddling.
[01:14:55.952 --> 01:14:57.413]  It's about total A.I.
[01:14:57.453 --> 01:14:57.993]  control.
[01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:00.154]  And Trump needs to take action.
[01:15:01.755 --> 01:15:02.996]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[01:15:03.076 --> 01:15:05.117]  Jacob, we're going to go in the order they've been received.
[01:15:05.617 --> 01:15:07.759]  Jacob in Ohio, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:15:07.799 --> 01:15:08.099]  Welcome.
[01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:17.044]  Alex, did you know that if you go to FreeShafer.com, you can see that a man in Terre Haute Federal Prison was beheaded by jihadis with a wire in above Supermax?
[01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:22.012]  My friend Schaefer Cox is in the same wing, and I'm concerned for his safety.
[01:15:22.452 --> 01:15:23.933]  He says people there have scurvy.
[01:15:24.293 --> 01:15:27.075]  If they don't give them vitamin C in this pandemic, that's murder.
[01:15:28.916 --> 01:15:32.297]  Well, I'm not aware of all that, but I know the Islamist has taken over the prisons.
[01:15:33.298 --> 01:15:34.398]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[01:15:36.039 --> 01:15:41.822]  Well, Schaefer Cox is going to go for a retrial, and in my estimation, if he can get it in the 9th Circuit.
[01:15:42.382 --> 01:15:43.503]  So, I'm looking forward to that.
[01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.768]  Uh, it's pretty safe for Cox.
[01:15:45.788 --> 01:15:48.090]  He needs a pardon, uh, just as much as Roger Stone does.
[01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:50.012]  Okay, I'll look into it, James.
[01:15:50.352 --> 01:15:52.694]  You called in about the Surgeon General, CDC, and coronavirus.
[01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:54.456]  Absolutely, we'll get to that.
[01:15:54.796 --> 01:15:59.920]  The Surgeon General has power over, uh, has super, super supervision over the Bureau of Prisons.
[01:16:00.601 --> 01:16:02.583]  And, uh, I'm concerned about... Alright, I gotta go.
[01:16:02.603 --> 01:16:09.669]  It's, it's one thing if you call in on that topic, I gotta go on to you, brother, but when you call in on one thing and you said it was another, I'm not doing it.
[01:16:10.236 --> 01:16:13.258]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to John in Virginia.
[01:16:13.298 --> 01:16:14.239]  John, thanks for calling.
[01:16:14.679 --> 01:16:17.321]  Yeah, they just passed in the House their gun confiscation.
[01:16:17.361 --> 01:16:17.962]  Sounds fun.
[01:16:19.103 --> 01:16:20.464]  Yeah, it sounds like a good time.
[01:16:20.484 --> 01:16:22.305]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:16:22.325 --> 01:16:23.526]  It's a privilege to talk to you.
[01:16:23.887 --> 01:16:28.690]  I'm a first-time caller and I hope you can get to my three questions and maybe comments.
[01:16:29.231 --> 01:16:35.696]  My first question for you is what can Trump do about what the Virginia governor and legislature, or legislation, are doing?
[01:16:36.296 --> 01:16:40.099]  And I'm just curious what you think he could do if he does anything.
[01:16:41.127 --> 01:16:42.228]  Well, that'd be with the courts.
[01:16:42.268 --> 01:16:43.468]  The Supreme Court of D.C.
[01:16:43.508 --> 01:16:46.570]  v. Sellers says that the legislation they're trying to pass is unconstitutional.
[01:16:48.551 --> 01:16:49.672]  That's what I would think, too.
[01:16:51.266 --> 01:16:55.807]  I guess my second question then, I mean, can he do something about it himself?
[01:16:56.167 --> 01:16:57.227]  I guess that's part of my first question.
[01:16:57.268 --> 01:17:02.829]  Well, I mean, you know, Governor Northam is a compromised, blackmailed individual with all his weird past.
[01:17:02.889 --> 01:17:07.350]  I mean, he's a doctor that's involved in literally baby part harvesting right there.
[01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:11.191]  The problem is Democrats, as you know, once they get control, they have election fraud.
[01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:14.036]  And that's why they've just got to be removed.
[01:17:14.076 --> 01:17:15.517]  They've got to be racketeer.
[01:17:15.577 --> 01:17:20.439]  Racketeer investigations have to happen and they've got to just be exposed as the criminal group they are.
[01:17:21.039 --> 01:17:27.903]  And I think that's the answer is Virginians getting pissed and Virginians exposing the election system and showing that this is all a takeover.
[01:17:27.923 --> 01:17:29.183]  I think that's the answer.
[01:17:30.944 --> 01:17:31.985]  I hope that happens.
[01:17:32.525 --> 01:17:37.208]  The other thing I want to ask you about is will the courts get into this fight?
[01:17:37.228 --> 01:17:41.730]  Do you think we'll go to the Supreme Court assuming we don't get anything radical like
[01:17:42.401 --> 01:17:44.383]  But I'd like to see happen what you just said.
[01:17:46.004 --> 01:17:50.587]  Oh, I think it will be overturned at the Supreme Court if they try to ban guns in Virginia again.
[01:17:50.607 --> 01:17:53.210]  And you're like, well, it's unpopular, so that'll wake folks up.
[01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:57.253]  Democrats literally take over jurisdictions and engage in election fraud.
[01:17:57.573 --> 01:17:59.955]  That's why they're invincible is because they're a fraud.
[01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:04.919]  But you expose the election machines and how Democrats never get removed from office.
[01:18:05.419 --> 01:18:07.940]  And how Democrats are actually a dead party.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.860]  That is how you bring them down.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.001]  That's how you expose them.
[01:18:11.261 --> 01:18:19.243]  And you get their own people that are involved in the election fraud to turn state's evidence and get a bunch of people to start turning against the deep state.
[01:18:19.563 --> 01:18:21.123]  And the whole house of cards will come down.
[01:18:21.143 --> 01:18:22.204]  We're very, very close to that.
[01:18:23.984 --> 01:18:28.205]  On that line, I actually worked in election during Obama's second election.
[01:18:28.826 --> 01:18:33.387]  And I watched election fraud here in my hometown, which was not fraud, what I watched was
[01:18:34.051 --> 01:18:35.392]  Of course, it's systemic.
[01:18:35.412 --> 01:18:36.713]  I mean, I don't just say Democrats.
[01:18:48.675 --> 01:18:49.756]  Don't get elected anywhere.
[01:18:49.816 --> 01:18:50.316]  They don't.
[01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:51.316]  Everyone hates them.
[01:18:51.356 --> 01:18:52.617]  They wreck everything.
[01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:54.398]  But they have election fraud.
[01:18:54.418 --> 01:19:02.142]  They're a bold, criminal, racketeering mafia that just tried to overthrow a president, that just tried to create a race war.
[01:19:02.742 --> 01:19:03.742]  And they're done.
[01:19:03.762 --> 01:19:06.984]  I mean, the only way to address them is as a criminal mafia.
[01:19:07.264 --> 01:19:07.764]  God bless you.
[01:19:07.784 --> 01:19:08.545]  Thanks for the call, John.
[01:19:09.125 --> 01:19:11.247]  All right, let's go to Mac in Wisconsin.
[01:19:11.307 --> 01:19:15.011]  Mac, you're on the air where the Democrats are going to have their DNC event.
[01:19:15.332 --> 01:19:18.615]  They say if Bernie doesn't get the nomination, they're going to burn the country down.
[01:19:18.655 --> 01:19:20.477]  Well, we'll be there covering it live.
[01:19:20.497 --> 01:19:23.160]  And as much as I dislike Bernie, he is the frontrunner.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.301]  They're trying to steal it from him.
[01:19:24.661 --> 01:19:26.183]  What do you think about Trump taking action?
[01:19:27.544 --> 01:19:30.107]  Well, Alex, boy, first of all,
[01:19:30.828 --> 01:19:41.915]  Maybe I'll see you there, Alex, and if I do, my friend, I'm going to give you the strongest handshake of a man-to-man that you will have ever felt, because I'm so glad you're on my side.
[01:19:41.935 --> 01:19:43.315]  I'm on your side, brother.
[01:19:43.355 --> 01:19:45.157]  These guys shake my hand all the time and crush my hand.
[01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:45.957]  I'm not that strong.
[01:19:45.977 --> 01:19:51.480]  I'm like a T-Rex, that little, you know.
[01:19:51.961 --> 01:19:59.285]  Sure, anyways, I wanted to call in about the censorship problem, and of course, we're losing our free speech, it seems like, daily.
[01:20:00.066 --> 01:20:10.150]  But, you know, with these platforms of Google, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and personally myself, who cares?
[01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:11.151]  I don't care about them.
[01:20:11.191 --> 01:20:16.012]  But you know, I'm probably one of your honest, longest-time listeners.
[01:20:16.153 --> 01:20:19.614]  I've been listening to you for 20, maybe even 22 years.
[01:20:19.754 --> 01:20:20.254]  Wow, brother.
[01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:21.014]  God bless you.
[01:20:21.115 --> 01:20:21.935]  This is no kidding.
[01:20:22.435 --> 01:20:29.398]  I discovered you on, of all things, a shortwave radio, and I've been listening to you ever since.
[01:20:30.438 --> 01:20:32.160]  So that was back in the William Cooper days.
[01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:33.502]  No kidding, my friend.
[01:20:33.923 --> 01:20:37.768]  And you know, this is something to keep in mind for your listeners.
[01:20:37.808 --> 01:20:45.238]  You know, if it was ever to happen, if they ever were able to hit that internet kill switch, you know what?
[01:20:45.836 --> 01:20:48.900]  We do have backup, and it's low-tech backup.
[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:49.521]  It ain't hype.
[01:20:49.661 --> 01:20:54.648]  Brother, we still pay $10,000 a month at WWCR to be on six hours a day.
[01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:56.631]  World Service, get a lot of letters.
[01:20:57.112 --> 01:21:01.618]  I get letters from Africa and places, people listening, so we still pay for that.
[01:21:01.638 --> 01:21:02.800]  It's part of the whole outreach we do.
[01:21:03.370 --> 01:21:03.930]  Great Alex.
[01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.251]  Yep.
[01:21:04.371 --> 01:21:06.972]  Everybody should have one in their preparedness stash.
[01:21:07.673 --> 01:21:15.458]  Well it's cool at your kitchen table to like at night or in the day just get on there and just dial through and it's like wow it's not watching you.
[01:21:15.878 --> 01:21:17.119]  Everything on the internet is two-way.
[01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:18.520]  Like it's watching what you're watching.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.063]  But think about with shortwave or broadcast TV, any of it.
[01:21:23.363 --> 01:21:24.784]  You're actually watching TV.
[01:21:24.824 --> 01:21:25.684]  It doesn't watch you.
[01:21:25.704 --> 01:21:27.846]  Remember back when TV didn't watch everybody?
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.481]  Yeah, you nailed it, bud.
[01:21:30.601 --> 01:21:32.043]  You just nailed it right there.
[01:21:32.363 --> 01:21:33.103]  That's very true.
[01:21:33.584 --> 01:21:35.445]  I can listen to that shortwave.
[01:21:35.726 --> 01:21:37.887]  I can dial in frequencies all over the world.
[01:21:37.967 --> 01:21:42.671]  I was a former radio man in the Navy back in Vietnam days on a ship.
[01:21:43.192 --> 01:21:44.393]  Think about the secret police.
[01:21:44.873 --> 01:21:47.775]  In Nazi Germany, if you listen to Allied broadcasts, you get arrested.
[01:21:48.116 --> 01:21:49.897]  Well, but they couldn't tell because you're listening.
[01:21:49.957 --> 01:21:51.098]  It's a receiver.
[01:21:51.498 --> 01:21:53.920]  But now with the Internet, they know what you're watching.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.821]  They have a whole record.
[01:21:55.301 --> 01:21:57.163]  So the thing has really got problems.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:59.081]  Alex, if I may, one more thing.
[01:21:59.221 --> 01:22:02.962]  I'd like to bring up the virus over there in China.
[01:22:03.342 --> 01:22:06.203]  I don't know if this has been discussed, and I'll try to make it quick, my friend.
[01:22:07.984 --> 01:22:15.707]  This over there, what's happening with this virus, do you think they are using that as a false flag in the manner of
[01:22:16.443 --> 01:22:27.808]  Now they're rounding up the protesters that were protesting over there and saying, oh, these people are loaded with a virus, but we're going to make it look like we're taking them out of their homes because of the virus.
[01:22:27.888 --> 01:22:30.730]  Are they arresting these people and never to be seen again?
[01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:31.370]  What do you think?
[01:22:32.571 --> 01:22:32.771]  I don't
[01:22:51.670 --> 01:22:52.610]  Trump's got his reasons.
[01:22:52.630 --> 01:22:53.511]  He doesn't want the economy.
[01:22:53.531 --> 01:23:02.173]  But praising Xi Jinping's response, agreeing with the UN, that, you know, Xi Jinping is absolutely using this as a giant power grab.
[01:23:02.213 --> 01:23:09.715]  And next hour, we've got Francis Boyle popping in to talk about how he called Friday for Trump to come out and say it may be a bioweapon.
[01:23:09.995 --> 01:23:11.476]  Trump did that hours later.
[01:23:11.876 --> 01:23:13.817]  And now the Chinese ambassador has responded.
[01:23:13.837 --> 01:23:14.577]  So that's all coming up.
[01:23:14.897 --> 01:23:15.977]  Matt, thank you so much.
[01:23:16.037 --> 01:23:16.797]  Okay, we're gonna go to break.
[01:23:19.332 --> 01:23:23.133]  We're gonna talk to Mitch and Tyler and everybody else.
[01:23:23.153 --> 01:23:25.673]  We're getting to every single one of these amazing phone calls.
[01:23:25.693 --> 01:23:28.334]  We got James and Debbie and George and Nick.
[01:23:29.574 --> 01:23:38.776]  And don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we've got great products at infowarestore.com that fund this operation, that make your life so much better in so many different ways.
[01:23:39.316 --> 01:23:40.337]  So take advantage of it.
[01:23:40.397 --> 01:23:45.738]  We have the Super Silver Toothpaste and the Super Blue Toothpaste with Nano Silver about to sell out.
[01:23:47.125 --> 01:23:48.606]  All right, let's go to your phone calls here.
[01:23:49.227 --> 01:23:54.871]  And then, Dr. Boyle, pops in for two segments, then the calls continue into the fourth hour.
[01:23:56.412 --> 01:23:59.795]  Let's go to Mitch in Canada, and then we'll go to Austin, Tyler, and Sam.
[01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:01.196]  Mitch, you're on the air.
[01:24:01.256 --> 01:24:01.856]  Thanks for holding.
[01:24:02.717 --> 01:24:04.078]  Alex, you're worth the wait, my friend.
[01:24:05.239 --> 01:24:06.160]  Well, thank you for being here.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:14.106]  Just wanted to see if you've referenced CCN, three reasons why stock markets
[01:24:18.308 --> 01:24:18.888]  I understand.
[01:24:19.349 --> 01:24:21.450]  Reference CCN Stock Market.
[01:24:23.211 --> 01:24:29.315]  Sorry, three reasons why the stock market is headed for a devastating crash.
[01:24:29.375 --> 01:24:42.182]  Now, if you go down the page, you'll see they have a video that if you skip to 5.09, you can blatantly see the central banks pumping in money to all the stock markets across the world.
[01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:44.343]  Oh, there's a global race of devaluation.
[01:24:44.363 --> 01:24:45.084]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:24:45.731 --> 01:24:46.872]  Like, how obvious is this?
[01:24:46.912 --> 01:24:48.313]  Like, how do people not see this?
[01:24:49.054 --> 01:24:52.136]  So anyway, I think we're headed for global recession.
[01:24:52.156 --> 01:24:53.117]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:24:53.197 --> 01:24:56.879]  And then if you also go to Healthline... Yeah, and then Trump wants us to be in the best position when the crash comes.
[01:24:56.919 --> 01:24:59.101]  There's no doubt that Trump's preparing a crash landing.
[01:25:00.242 --> 01:25:04.165]  And if he doesn't, he wants to stall it until he gets re-elected.
[01:25:04.545 --> 01:25:06.547]  But it's still, I mean, it's gonna be a circus.
[01:25:06.567 --> 01:25:10.249]  It's gonna be a fight uphill if he gets re-elected and he's gonna deal with this, no doubt.
[01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:15.093]  If you go to Healthline, how flu and HIV meds may help fight the new coronavirus.
[01:25:16.299 --> 01:25:23.842]  Come on, like, how is a HIV medication supposed to help this bat virus, or whatever you want to call it?
[01:25:24.462 --> 01:25:25.703]  This is man-made, man.
[01:25:25.903 --> 01:25:26.964]  Like, this is man-made.
[01:25:27.864 --> 01:25:32.566]  It has the HIV delivery system, and they're like, oh, and don't worry, HIV medicine helps.
[01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:35.130]  Yeah, we can profit off of this.
[01:25:35.210 --> 01:25:35.891]  But you know what?
[01:25:35.971 --> 01:25:43.414]  At the end of the day, I'm just disgusted with the fact that, you know, some people have decided that they would go forward with biological warfare programs.
[01:25:43.874 --> 01:25:47.295]  You've put the entire human race at risk, and shame on you.
[01:25:47.455 --> 01:25:48.936]  Like, it's just disgusting.
[01:25:49.196 --> 01:25:50.796]  And then we're not supposed to question it.
[01:25:51.036 --> 01:25:55.998]  Like, they praise Chinese activist questioning, but when we do it, or you do it, you get banned.
[01:25:56.018 --> 01:25:58.599]  Oh, we're not supposed to do that in the West, question things.
[01:25:58.659 --> 01:26:00.520]  Just, you know, believe Jussie Smollett.
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.281]  It's just mind-boggling.
[01:26:03.301 --> 01:26:07.342]  But anyway, I just want to say thank you very much for what you do and really appreciate it.
[01:26:07.382 --> 01:26:10.302]  I hope that people look into these things a little bit further.
[01:26:10.322 --> 01:26:11.703]  Brother, I appreciate you.
[01:26:11.743 --> 01:26:14.144]  You're talking about the tail wagging the dog, man.
[01:26:14.204 --> 01:26:15.064]  You're the dog, brother.
[01:26:15.444 --> 01:26:15.864]  We love you.
[01:26:16.264 --> 01:26:17.905]  Tyler in California, real fast.
[01:26:17.925 --> 01:26:18.485]  Go ahead, Tyler.
[01:26:18.505 --> 01:26:20.705]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:20.745 --> 01:26:21.486]  Just a couple things.
[01:26:21.506 --> 01:26:22.446]  I want to make my point.
[01:26:22.546 --> 01:26:26.487]  How the Empire Strikes Back, it's about the Electoral College.
[01:26:26.587 --> 01:26:28.127]  And I've been seeing it.
[01:26:28.207 --> 01:26:29.908]  Oh yeah, they want to get rid of that, don't they?
[01:26:31.308 --> 01:26:32.028]  Well, you can see it.
[01:26:32.048 --> 01:26:37.271]  There's been pieces the last week or so, I'm out here on the West Coast, and they're demonizing the Electoral College.
[01:26:37.731 --> 01:26:38.651]  You know, it was bad.
[01:26:39.011 --> 01:26:41.752]  Trump never accepted the results of the election.
[01:26:41.772 --> 01:26:43.593]  Hillary won the vote, which we know she didn't.
[01:26:44.053 --> 01:26:50.776]  But they've already taken out, well, they're trying to, social media and the grassroots, I call them the generals, Stone and Assange.
[01:26:50.836 --> 01:26:52.897]  Those are the big things that got Trump in.
[01:26:53.137 --> 01:26:53.537]  No, you're right.
[01:26:53.617 --> 01:26:58.199]  And they're setting the precedent to dispute the next election.
[01:26:59.195 --> 01:26:59.375]  Yep.
[01:26:59.795 --> 01:27:01.837]  And the coronavirus, they can use that.
[01:27:02.177 --> 01:27:06.300]  When people start dying, you know, it's really easy to say, Trump's incompetent.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:07.180]  Look what happened.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.862]  The virus broke out.
[01:27:09.782 --> 01:27:11.143]  You know, he didn't do anything about it.
[01:27:11.223 --> 01:27:13.265]  When people start dying, people panic.
[01:27:13.305 --> 01:27:14.405]  They do irrational things.
[01:27:14.886 --> 01:27:16.827]  So that's just one more thing that they can use.
[01:27:17.007 --> 01:27:18.868]  And it's all coming up to the election, man.
[01:27:19.209 --> 01:27:20.329]  That's what it's coming down to.
[01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:23.592]  And I really think you should look into that.
[01:27:23.632 --> 01:27:25.853]  The Electoral College is going to be their next move.
[01:27:25.893 --> 01:27:28.595]  They're going to try to demonize it and basically get rid of it.
[01:27:31.104 --> 01:27:32.165]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:34.087]  We'll cover all that.
[01:27:34.128 --> 01:27:35.009]  Thank you so much, Tyler.
[01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:47.163]  When we come back, we've got a gentleman on who was here with us Friday saying we need an investigation of this being a bio weapon.
[01:27:47.603 --> 01:27:49.946]  And then hours later, you saw the White House spokesperson
[01:27:51.834 --> 01:27:55.717]  He joined us last week and said he needs to be investigated as a bioweapon and we've had
[01:28:14.875 --> 01:28:18.917]  One of Trump's spokespersons come out and say the same thing just a few hours later.
[01:28:18.937 --> 01:28:23.820]  So I wanted to get an update from Dr. Francis Boyle, who wrote the U.S.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:29.023]  Biological Weapons Convention that then got adopted, most of it, by the United Nations.
[01:28:29.043 --> 01:28:38.128]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he's an author, researcher, and again, a top bioweapons expert, not just in the technicals, but also in the law.
[01:28:38.648 --> 01:28:43.351]  So let's get right to him and the two segments we have in the developments we've had in the last
[01:28:44.568 --> 01:28:47.770]  Five, six days since he was last on.
[01:28:48.071 --> 01:28:49.872]  Thanks for joining us, Doctor.
[01:28:51.593 --> 01:28:53.635]  Thank you very much for having me on, Alex.
[01:28:53.675 --> 01:28:54.996]  My best to your viewing audience.
[01:28:55.036 --> 01:29:01.641]  And I just wanted to commend you personally for staying on top of this.
[01:29:02.482 --> 01:29:09.027]  I think you're doing a real public service for the American people and the United States of America.
[01:29:10.568 --> 01:29:13.090]  The situation apparently has
[01:29:13.923 --> 01:29:14.703]  Gotten worse.
[01:29:15.004 --> 01:29:26.749]  A British health care specialist has estimated that the incubation period is now 24 days instead of 14 days.
[01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:32.532]  You really can't believe anything coming out of China on this.
[01:29:32.612 --> 01:29:38.495]  You can watch on the BBC and other sources being there.
[01:29:39.729 --> 01:29:49.711]  This disinformation that a panglobin was somehow involved is total bull twaddle coming out of China.
[01:29:50.392 --> 01:30:05.115]  Panglobins have been around since the Pliocene Age with the dinosaurs and what all of a sudden out of nowhere in 2020 they become more lethal than the Spanish flu virus.
[01:30:05.875 --> 01:30:27.833]  The lethality rate has now been estimated somewhere between 15% to 18%, 17% even if you believe the figures coming out of China, 18% I believe by a British healthcare worker.
[01:30:28.594 --> 01:30:33.338]  There is now the report in Hong Kong, just came out today,
[01:30:34.128 --> 01:30:53.304]  That this coronavirus has been spread by a leaky sewage pipe, which to me indicates that it can be transmitted by human feces and or urine.
[01:30:54.005 --> 01:30:59.370]  Recall I had told you before this has a gain-of-function
[01:31:00.306 --> 01:31:05.070]  Uh, properties, which means it can be, it does travel by air.
[01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:18.860]  Uh, so that wouldn't surprise me that, you know, someone's poop is, uh, going down, uh, downstairs, uh, to the sewer, and there's a leaky, uh, uh, uh, sewage drain there.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.901]  And it just off-gases the virus?
[01:31:21.882 --> 01:31:22.162]  Pardon me?
[01:31:22.683 --> 01:31:23.823]  It off-gases the virus?
[01:31:25.204 --> 01:31:25.925]  It is the virus.
[01:31:25.985 --> 01:31:27.206]  I think it's, uh, uh,
[01:31:27.967 --> 01:31:29.168]  As I said, gain of function.
[01:31:29.368 --> 01:31:29.569]  Right.
[01:31:29.909 --> 01:31:34.493]  So, this is... But define gain of function for those who don't know what that means, please, Professor.
[01:31:35.574 --> 01:31:43.642]  It has been enhanced by DNA, genetic engineering, and or synthetic biology to make it... It's supercharged.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.921]  It is turbocharged, that's correct.
[01:31:46.961 --> 01:31:52.303]  If you saw that movie, Ford vs. Ferrari, that's exactly what we're doing here.
[01:31:52.964 --> 01:31:57.946]  Souped up Shelby GTO, no question at all about it.
[01:32:00.487 --> 01:32:03.689]  Clearly governments are freaking out, but they're trying to act like it's no big deal.
[01:32:03.769 --> 01:32:08.491]  Is that because they know how big a threat it is, and will they be successful covering it up?
[01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:22.833]  Well, you'll see the United States Army has already designated several military bases around the country to detain people who are infected.
[01:32:23.294 --> 01:32:26.975]  So I think the United States government knows how serious it is.
[01:32:28.395 --> 01:32:34.857]  I still don't believe that President Trump has been properly advised here.
[01:32:36.152 --> 01:32:39.295]  As I said, I'm not blaming President Trump.
[01:32:39.836 --> 01:32:41.497]  He's not an expert in this field.
[01:32:41.857 --> 01:32:44.319]  He has to rely on his advisors.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.625]  Tony Fauci has been up to his eyeballs in this Nazi biowarfare work.
[01:32:51.441 --> 01:33:11.875]  Well, Dr. Boyle, believe me, I like Trump overall, but I'm not, I don't hold punches, and he respects the show, and he respects, I know, the work we do here, and you.
[01:33:12.315 --> 01:33:13.496]  So, address the President.
[01:33:13.516 --> 01:33:19.120]  Good chance he or his adjuncts will end up giving him the message, because he wants these messages brought to him.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:20.741]  So, what do you want to say to President Trump?
[01:33:21.874 --> 01:33:27.596]  Well, again, Azar, this is a case of the fox being in charge of the chicken coup.
[01:33:28.156 --> 01:33:40.779]  He was an employee and a lobbyist for the drug industry, and the drug industry is all up and down involved in Nazi bio-warfare work.
[01:33:41.219 --> 01:33:44.000]  You are correct that the president has asked for
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.040]  Yes.
[01:34:07.249 --> 01:34:14.976]  Anything the National Academy of Sciences said here, everyone is feeding off at the trough here, Alex.
[01:34:15.517 --> 01:34:20.801]  As I said, as the last time I crunched the numbers, 2015, it was $100 billion, and that's $5 billion a year.
[01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:23.283]  So my guess is, as of now, it's $120 billion that has been spent.
[01:34:30.389 --> 01:34:43.958]  And they've bought off, as of 2015, 13,000 so-called life scientists, I call them death scientists, to work on this, and I don't know what the numbers are today.
[01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:54.025]  Sure, from all my sources, though, they're concurring with what you're saying, that the best approximation is a bioweapon they were playing around with maybe for a vaccine got out.
[01:34:54.785 --> 01:34:59.550]  And so many times with the Russians, the US, this stuff just keeps getting out.
[01:35:00.190 --> 01:35:04.735]  And so this is a pretty big disaster for the CHICOMS and for Big Pharma here, isn't it?
[01:35:06.176 --> 01:35:06.637]  Of course.
[01:35:07.377 --> 01:35:10.741]  And, you know, these people like Fauci,
[01:35:11.828 --> 01:35:26.784]  CDC, all they want to do is protect the billions of dollars they've already wasted on their BSL-3 and BSL-4 biowarfare weapons labs and everyone else involved in it.
[01:35:27.424 --> 01:35:32.329]  As for playing around with a vaccine there at that Wuhan BSL-4,
[01:35:34.986 --> 01:35:38.127]  You have to understand the technology involved here.
[01:35:38.487 --> 01:35:41.587]  It was not just that they were playing around with the vaccine.
[01:35:42.247 --> 01:35:50.929]  The way this works out is they first DNA genetically engineer a biowarfare agent.
[01:35:51.429 --> 01:35:53.709]  And that is what we are dealing with here.
[01:35:53.869 --> 01:36:00.470]  A biowarfare agent that is extremely lethal and extremely infectious.
[01:36:01.091 --> 01:36:03.671]  And then once they have the agent,
[01:36:04.415 --> 01:36:09.305]  They then try to develop a vaccine to counteract the agent.
[01:36:09.855 --> 01:36:13.516]  Because that is what a biowarfare weapon really is.
[01:36:13.576 --> 01:36:20.397]  And by the way, when you were last on, I saw a lot of comments, probably synthetic, they were like, of course we have to study this.
[01:36:20.558 --> 01:36:22.098]  Anyone could make this on their kitchen table.
[01:36:22.198 --> 01:36:24.158]  No, you can't make it on a kitchen table.
[01:36:24.218 --> 01:36:29.660]  It's gene editing, it's billion-dollar technology, and they're creating it.
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:34.401]  It's ridiculous to say someone might make it, so we've got to make it.
[01:36:34.461 --> 01:36:35.101]  That's insane.
[01:36:36.553 --> 01:36:53.819]  Well, that's the standard propaganda that these biowarfare death scientists, NIAID, National Institutes for Health, CDC, and Big Pharma have made in order to justify all this Nazi biowarfare work.
[01:36:54.279 --> 01:37:04.926]  Well, someone might be able to do it, so we have to be able to study it, and then we can make the biowarfare agents, so that then we can develop a vaccine.
[01:37:05.006 --> 01:37:06.947]  That's exactly what's going on here, Alex.
[01:37:08.108 --> 01:37:09.108]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:37:09.209 --> 01:37:13.151]  And as our technology gets more and more advanced, well, somebody might make it, so we better make it.
[01:37:13.171 --> 01:37:14.572]  There's that logic.
[01:37:14.932 --> 01:37:17.154]  No, we need to hunt down whoever does it and stop them.
[01:37:17.194 --> 01:37:18.234]  We need to have a convention.
[01:37:18.494 --> 01:37:22.457]  We need to stop it as a moral society and say we're not doing it.
[01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:27.992]  Well, unfortunately, Alex, we have a convention, the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972.
[01:37:29.914 --> 01:37:47.768]  And then, because that convention was not drawn up specifically designed to deal with DNA genetic engineering and or synthetic biology, I drafted that implementing legislation, the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act.
[01:37:47.948 --> 01:37:50.530]  Stay there, let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:37:51.235 --> 01:37:52.335]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:37:52.435 --> 01:37:54.276]  Dr. Francis Boyle with us for another segment.
[01:37:54.296 --> 01:37:57.356]  I hope he'll join us coming up in the next week or two for a full hour.
[01:37:58.516 --> 01:38:03.337]  But I appreciate him popping in your calls and a bunch of news breaking coming up in the next segment, as promised.
[01:38:04.138 --> 01:38:06.518]  So, without me asking the questions here, you're the expert.
[01:38:07.858 --> 01:38:16.540]  Right after you come on, right after Senator Cotton says it should be looked at as man-made, the Indian Institute saying it looks man-made, showing where it's clearly been gene-edited,
[01:38:18.703 --> 01:38:21.804]  Not getting into whether Fauci's good or not, I respect you, I understand what you're saying.
[01:38:22.384 --> 01:38:35.067]  They are responding, and Cotton's come out again, and now the Chinese ambassador, we have that clip, if you haven't seen it, I can play it, you probably have seen it, comes out and laughs at Trump and says it's preposterous to say that, you know, this could be man-made.
[01:38:35.627 --> 01:38:37.687]  Well, why shouldn't we look at the origin?
[01:38:37.747 --> 01:38:38.988]  Why is that being censored?
[01:38:39.628 --> 01:38:44.849]  So what do you think's really going on here, and as mainline virologists, mainline academics,
[01:38:45.794 --> 01:38:47.315]  Echo what you've been saying for weeks.
[01:38:48.495 --> 01:38:51.437]  I mean, I think that shows that they're concerned because they know this is man-made.
[01:38:51.697 --> 01:38:55.939]  Because clearly there's a major response going on at a level never before seen.
[01:38:57.599 --> 01:38:57.979]  Right, Alex.
[01:38:57.999 --> 01:39:02.061]  Well, let me get back, you know, to my advice to President Trump.
[01:39:02.621 --> 01:39:06.003]  And again, I'm not criticizing the president or anything like that.
[01:39:06.563 --> 01:39:07.804]  He needs to bring in
[01:39:09.365 --> 01:39:21.710]  A team of outside independent experts here who have spent their careers opposing biological weapons and not up to their eyeballs in biological weapons.
[01:39:21.730 --> 01:39:23.751]  Because folks that are involved in it are going to cover it up.
[01:39:24.699 --> 01:39:36.732]  Of course they're going to cover it up because the money involved, and this is all CYA, because people are going to start to ask, what have you done with that $120 billion we've given you?
[01:39:37.172 --> 01:39:39.895]  So right, the President must put together a team
[01:39:41.276 --> 01:39:47.422]  Of outside independent experts who have spent their careers opposing biological weapons.
[01:39:48.243 --> 01:39:50.565]  And I'm not saying, you know, we are behind this.
[01:39:51.045 --> 01:40:01.595]  It's clear, in my opinion, it leaked out of that Wuhan BSL-4 facility, and it is an extremely dangerous biological weapon.
[01:40:02.015 --> 01:40:06.540]  And the only people who can give President Trump the proper advice
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.382]  By the way, you've been harping on that, but it's true.
[01:40:09.402 --> 01:40:15.568]  Anyone that's connected to bioweapons production cannot be heard from because they have a built-in reason to cover this up.
[01:40:27.762 --> 01:40:28.463]  Exactly right.
[01:40:28.924 --> 01:40:38.517]  And as I said, the last time I crunched the numbers, 2015, there were 13,000, I call them, death scientists working on it.
[01:40:38.577 --> 01:40:40.821]  So of course they don't have any- So let's pull back though.
[01:40:42.543 --> 01:40:47.085]  I mean, let's pull back just as a researcher, as a lawyer, as a historian.
[01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:49.427]  How bad do you really think this is going to get?
[01:40:49.487 --> 01:40:52.148]  Because clearly the numbers and the things coming out of China aren't accurate.
[01:40:52.408 --> 01:40:56.631]  The footage we see is just bedlam, and they're locking other major cities down.
[01:40:56.691 --> 01:40:59.012]  So it looks like this is a bioweapon, as you said.
[01:40:59.292 --> 01:41:00.333]  We know it's man-made.
[01:41:00.653 --> 01:41:02.974]  So gut level, how bad do you think it's going to get?
[01:41:05.255 --> 01:41:06.356]  Well, Alex.
[01:41:07.190 --> 01:41:10.911]  I'm not here to scare people one way or the other.
[01:41:11.151 --> 01:41:15.052]  No, but as a father, I want to know your gut level opinion, because everything's dead reckoning.
[01:41:15.072 --> 01:41:20.834]  I get you can be academic all day, but just gut level, do you think it's really bad or do you think it's being hyped up?
[01:41:21.434 --> 01:41:22.034]  It's terrible.
[01:41:22.754 --> 01:41:23.974]  It's absolutely terrible.
[01:41:24.395 --> 01:41:27.555]  I personally think it'll be a lot worse than the Spanish flu virus.
[01:41:27.655 --> 01:41:33.497]  That being said, however, I think, I think President Trump, if he acts now,
[01:41:34.534 --> 01:41:38.238]  Could very well prevent the worst for the United States of America.
[01:41:39.178 --> 01:41:42.361]  I'm not sure what can be done for the rest of the world, certainly China.
[01:41:42.942 --> 01:41:48.807]  No, I agree with you, and I think they could be using this to sucker punch Trump if his response isn't strong enough.
[01:41:48.827 --> 01:41:54.072]  The way China says, oh, we're going to shoot people at checkpoints, but we block a few flights, the media says it's terrible.
[01:41:54.352 --> 01:41:56.014]  It's like they want this to get bad here.
[01:41:57.984 --> 01:42:00.149]  Well, I don't know, Alex.
[01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:06.645]  What I am saying is I believe that if President Trump were to bring in a team of experts who spent their career
[01:42:07.729 --> 01:42:11.151]  Opposing biological warfare weapons.
[01:42:12.492 --> 01:42:14.153]  Hopefully he could contain this.
[01:42:14.233 --> 01:42:24.958]  Right now, you know, we have 13 people, they say, who are infected, but they just released these people off the Air Force base.
[01:42:24.978 --> 01:42:25.799]  Oh yeah, what about that?
[01:42:25.879 --> 01:42:29.541]  Like, they were infected, but they let them go, and now that's crazy.
[01:42:30.715 --> 01:42:34.976]  It seems that the latest British Health Authority has said it's 24 days.
[01:42:35.616 --> 01:42:40.077]  And one person was released by a mistake, by an accident.
[01:42:40.137 --> 01:42:46.498]  I mean, I don't wish to attribute, you know... Malice to where it's encompassed.
[01:42:46.518 --> 01:42:47.699]  Malice to everyone.
[01:42:48.119 --> 01:42:52.520]  You know, this is human beings at work and people make mistakes, Alan.
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:54.320]  No, but I agree with you.
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:58.921]  We should be worried about containment instead of political correctness.
[01:43:00.677 --> 01:43:02.283]  We're not really seeing that right now, so...
[01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:04.530]  I think that's correct.
[01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:12.392]  President Trump needs to undertake a massive campaign in this country of containment.
[01:43:12.932 --> 01:43:14.233]  That is absolutely right.
[01:43:14.753 --> 01:43:21.214]  And the problem is that the mainstream news media refuses to report any of this.
[01:43:22.035 --> 01:43:31.257]  They just go along with the propaganda line by the CDC, WHO, which, as I said before, is working in cahoots with the Chinese government.
[01:43:31.377 --> 01:43:36.422]  And we know now, China did cover this up for months, and that's blown up in their face.
[01:43:36.462 --> 01:43:38.383]  So Trump doesn't want to repeat that.
[01:43:38.423 --> 01:43:39.224]  There's still time.
[01:43:39.564 --> 01:43:41.166]  Because if it's not as bad as we think, great!
[01:43:41.867 --> 01:43:42.767]  He had a better response.
[01:43:42.807 --> 01:43:43.788]  But I mean, I agree with you.
[01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:45.850]  He doesn't want to get caught flat-footed on this.
[01:43:46.871 --> 01:43:47.151]  Right.
[01:43:47.332 --> 01:43:50.775]  And let me just give you a personal example, Alex.
[01:43:51.503 --> 01:43:58.353]  I was the first one to publicly blow the whistle that Amerithrax came out of a U.S.
[01:43:58.413 --> 01:44:01.879]  government biological warfare laboratory.
[01:44:02.039 --> 01:44:04.783]  That was the first week in November.
[01:44:05.612 --> 01:44:11.057]  And yet, soon after I did, an order was given to silence me.
[01:44:11.697 --> 01:44:19.784]  And no mainstream news media ever since then, since November, the first week of November 2001, has ever interviewed me.
[01:44:19.825 --> 01:44:23.608]  And for those that don't know, that was the experimental anthrax shot that admittedly killed so many.
[01:44:25.259 --> 01:44:26.360]  Well, that wasn't the shot.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.701]  That was anthrax.
[01:44:27.761 --> 01:44:30.743]  That was super weapons-grade anthrax.
[01:44:30.763 --> 01:44:32.665]  I remember you exposed that's what happened.
[01:44:33.065 --> 01:44:35.767]  Remember they had the anthrax vaccines to kill people.
[01:44:35.847 --> 01:44:36.808]  Vaccines too.
[01:44:36.988 --> 01:44:38.529]  I was involved in that, yes.
[01:44:38.649 --> 01:44:42.492]  But this is emerythrax that was October 2001 after the Paris attack.
[01:44:47.556 --> 01:44:48.937]  I know you said you could stay a little bit longer.
[01:44:48.957 --> 01:44:50.178]  I'm going to go to the calls, I promise, folks.
[01:44:50.198 --> 01:44:57.523]  But you should take us back then to the miniaturized Fort Detrick, Maryland, and then the deaths and the cover-up to remember.
[01:44:57.543 --> 01:44:58.303]  Because you were there.
[01:44:58.323 --> 01:44:59.704]  You were on the show back then, my God.
[01:44:59.724 --> 01:45:00.725]  I remember this now.
[01:45:00.765 --> 01:45:00.965]  I was.
[01:45:01.125 --> 01:45:01.605]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:01.625 --> 01:45:02.706]  You've been on the show 20 years.
[01:45:02.726 --> 01:45:05.868]  It's hard to believe that, yeah, what happened with anthrax?
[01:45:05.908 --> 01:45:06.708]  That was a whole other deal.
[01:45:06.728 --> 01:45:10.571]  Plus, I'm not a biologist, but anthrax can live like 20,000 years in the ground.
[01:45:10.891 --> 01:45:14.073]  How do you attenuate anthrax and then put it in somebody's body?
[01:45:14.113 --> 01:45:14.974]  Of course it doesn't work.
[01:45:15.714 --> 01:45:18.935]  We'll briefly talk about that with Dr. Francis Boyle and then go to your phone calls.
[01:45:19.576 --> 01:45:25.798]  Everybody that is patiently holding here on this February 12th, Wednesday broadcast.
[01:45:25.878 --> 01:45:27.179]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[01:45:27.539 --> 01:45:31.180]  And I will get to Debbie and George and Nick and Wilde and J.K.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:31.960]  J.K.'
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:36.622]  's up next and then Jordan and Austin after the professor leaves us.
[01:45:36.662 --> 01:45:38.823]  But yeah, this is just a crazy time to be alive.
[01:45:39.363 --> 01:45:40.024]  Please remember that
[01:45:41.175 --> 01:45:45.538]  We're Lister Supported, and it's you buying products in Forestore.com that makes this whole show possible.
[01:45:46.118 --> 01:45:58.326]  We have sold out of the 16-ounce amine gargle with the nano-patented silver that goes after this class of viruses, but we have the 1-ounce and we have the 3-ounce, 3.4-ounce that are left.
[01:45:59.427 --> 01:46:03.770]  They're about to sell out, but the good news is we have the nano-silver toothpaste
[01:46:05.191 --> 01:46:07.672]  In super blue and in super silver.
[01:46:07.812 --> 01:46:09.213]  Super silver is the tooth whitening.
[01:46:09.233 --> 01:46:12.915]  Super blue has the tea tree that's also antiviral as well.
[01:46:13.275 --> 01:46:14.616]  These are just high quality toothpaste.
[01:46:14.676 --> 01:46:16.017]  Just good for your mouth, good for your body.
[01:46:16.817 --> 01:46:19.218]  Good to have a good clean palate and it funds the info war.
[01:46:19.539 --> 01:46:25.442]  This is still 50% off, despite the fact that it is set to sell out the next two weeks at current sales rates.
[01:46:25.842 --> 01:46:27.743]  But the immune gargles are set to sell out right now.
[01:46:27.823 --> 01:46:29.504]  So please take advantage of those.
[01:46:29.524 --> 01:46:30.104]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:31.225 --> 01:46:33.306]  All right, finishing up with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[01:46:35.191 --> 01:46:39.075]  And getting into what he just raised during the last segment.
[01:46:41.358 --> 01:46:41.919]  Anthrax.
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.481]  I mean, that was U.S.
[01:46:44.521 --> 01:46:46.123]  government bioweapons grade.
[01:46:46.704 --> 01:46:49.627]  Then a bunch of people they tried to frame ended up dying in custody.
[01:46:50.388 --> 01:46:52.490]  And he was right at the heart of exposing that.
[01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:53.832]  It's not about O tooting his horn.
[01:46:56.573 --> 01:46:58.274]  Mild-mannered, shy guy.
[01:46:58.334 --> 01:47:01.395]  It's that he's been speaking out for decades on what's right.
[01:47:01.776 --> 01:47:02.656]  He's the author of the U.S.
[01:47:02.696 --> 01:47:04.157]  Biological Weapons Convention.
[01:47:04.717 --> 01:47:05.978]  All of us who's an expert on that.
[01:47:06.038 --> 01:47:10.059]  In closing, the lessons of anthrax versus the lessons now.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:13.221]  These things pretty much parallel each other, or am I wrong?
[01:47:14.662 --> 01:47:18.824]  No, that was completely covered up by the United States government.
[01:47:18.884 --> 01:47:20.444]  There's no question at all about it.
[01:47:20.925 --> 01:47:24.166]  This was super weapons-grade anthrax.
[01:47:24.226 --> 01:47:25.687]  It was a trillion spores.
[01:47:26.303 --> 01:47:27.263]  We're good to go.
[01:47:38.269 --> 01:47:39.150]  Uh, for sure.
[01:47:39.170 --> 01:47:41.771]  Uh, and yet they, uh, covered it up.
[01:47:41.891 --> 01:47:43.772]  They tried to blame one fellow.
[01:47:43.812 --> 01:47:44.653]  He fought back.
[01:47:45.213 --> 01:47:52.557]  Then they pinned the blame on, uh, Ivins and basically drove him into suicide and said, uh, case closed.
[01:47:52.697 --> 01:47:53.958]  And, and that was that.
[01:47:54.518 --> 01:48:00.742]  So the problem here, Alex, is that as you correctly pointed out, anthrax does not degrade.
[01:48:01.329 --> 01:48:16.650]  So somewhere there, either at Fort Detrick or Dugway, there is a stockpile of super weapons-grade anthrax, like the Amerithrax, that they can use again whenever they decide they want to use it again.
[01:48:16.810 --> 01:48:17.030]  Right.
[01:48:17.150 --> 01:48:18.813]  This is extremely dangerous business.
[01:48:21.172 --> 01:48:22.612]  And there's the whole side issue.
[01:48:22.892 --> 01:48:25.553]  Again, I'm not a biologist, but I research what biologists said.
[01:48:25.573 --> 01:48:34.816]  If the spore of anthrax lasts thousands of years and you really can't even kill it, then how do you inject it in somebody to create an autoimmune response as a vaccine?
[01:48:35.576 --> 01:48:37.556]  No wonder the vaccine killed so many people.
[01:48:39.037 --> 01:48:43.418]  Well, that vaccine, yes, was extremely dangerous.
[01:48:44.804 --> 01:49:12.851]  What happened was, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, in the run-up to the Gulf War I by Bush Sr., Cheney ordered experimental vaccines for anthrax and botulism to be inflicted on all of our troops headed for Iraq because Cheney knew full well, Cheney being a neocon, that... They transferred that to Saddam.
[01:49:13.814 --> 01:49:26.180]  Under Reagan, we had already sent the CDC and American-Type Culture Collection 40 shipments of weapons-grade U.S.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:37.165]  military bio-warfare agents for Saddam Hussein in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize them and use them against Iraq.
[01:49:37.665 --> 01:49:39.906]  And again, this is all mad scientist behavior.
[01:49:40.026 --> 01:49:40.987]  Why would you do that?
[01:49:43.365 --> 01:49:52.308]  They figured Saddam Hussein would weaponize these biological warfare agents that we gave him and use them against Iran in the Iran-Iraq War.
[01:49:52.828 --> 01:49:57.430]  He did not use them, but the problem was when the war was over, U.S.
[01:49:57.490 --> 01:50:07.894]  military forces were just instructed to blow up these biological warfare laboratories, and of course you can't dispose of biological weapons that way.
[01:50:10.234 --> 01:50:14.616]  Well, that's my view on nuclear reactors.
[01:50:15.216 --> 01:50:21.638]  I'm all for nuclear power until I realize the companies never have the upkeep, don't care if they leak, and just don't care if they blow up.
[01:50:21.738 --> 01:50:23.958]  Well, it's like, okay, we have nuclear power because people are crazy.
[01:50:24.278 --> 01:50:26.519]  And like, why are you making anthrax and handing it out?
[01:50:26.599 --> 01:50:30.240]  It is a mad scientist's vein to these people.
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:34.382]  Just in closing, you've been around them, you know, top PhD in their own programs.
[01:50:35.163 --> 01:50:37.204]  What's up with this mad scientist thing?
[01:50:37.284 --> 01:50:38.425]  Why do they even do this?
[01:50:38.505 --> 01:50:41.287]  Because just because I can do something, I don't do it.
[01:50:41.307 --> 01:50:42.447]  I don't understand it.
[01:50:44.068 --> 01:50:49.752]  Well, as for most of them, it's just greed and selfishness, ambition and money.
[01:50:49.852 --> 01:50:52.594]  But at the very top, it's a different story.
[01:50:53.154 --> 01:50:58.738]  I told you I deliberately went through the exact same PhD program at Harvard.
[01:50:59.298 --> 01:50:59.578]  Eugenics.
[01:51:27.391 --> 01:51:32.252]  It's that simple.
[01:51:32.713 --> 01:51:46.916]  Indeed, Kissinger's colleague there at Harvard, Professor Stanley Hoffman, who was my PhD supervisor, has publicly stated that Kissinger is thoroughly Machiavellian to the bone.
[01:51:47.728 --> 01:51:54.374]  And that is the type of people that Harvard generates and still generates today.
[01:51:54.534 --> 01:51:54.955]  No, I agree.
[01:51:55.035 --> 01:51:58.618]  Machiavelli, though, is the political development or deployment system.
[01:51:58.979 --> 01:52:01.621]  But you were saying last week the operating system is eugenics.
[01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:04.224]  Well, that's correct.
[01:52:04.364 --> 01:52:06.626]  And also it ties into eugenics.
[01:52:07.479 --> 01:52:14.144]  As you know, the Rockefeller Foundation was an early proponent of eugenics.
[01:52:14.584 --> 01:52:17.646]  Kissinger was on the payroll of the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:52:17.686 --> 01:52:19.867]  Well sure, he penned Memorandum 200.
[01:52:20.007 --> 01:52:22.109]  I mean, they admit right there, population reduction.
[01:52:22.867 --> 01:52:23.607]  That is correct.
[01:52:23.688 --> 01:52:35.895]  If you read the Kissinger memorandum, it says population reduction shall be a national security objective of the United States of America.
[01:52:36.475 --> 01:52:41.858]  I have never read anyone revoking that national security memorandum.
[01:52:42.078 --> 01:52:44.480]  Bottom line, they get off on playing God.
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:46.201]  Dr. Boyle, thank you for all the time.
[01:52:46.541 --> 01:52:49.483]  Please come back again as soon as you can to break this down.
[01:52:49.543 --> 01:52:49.843]  Thank you.
[01:52:50.643 --> 01:52:54.586]  Well, again, Alex, I do want to thank you for staying on top of this.
[01:52:55.326 --> 01:53:00.530]  I think you're doing real public service to the American people and the United States government.
[01:53:00.690 --> 01:53:09.096]  Whatever our political parties, race, creed, national origin may be, this affects all of us and our families.
[01:53:09.196 --> 01:53:09.497]  Thank you.
[01:53:09.517 --> 01:53:10.077]  It certainly does.
[01:53:10.117 --> 01:53:10.457]  Thank you.
[01:53:10.517 --> 01:53:12.098]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:53:12.138 --> 01:53:14.040]  Don't thank me, though, for just trying to cover the topics.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.941]  I'm just trying to figure out what the hell's going on.
[01:53:16.001 --> 01:53:19.444]  And we're seeing a massive response to this virus.
[01:53:21.178 --> 01:53:24.020]  So it's either the biggest hype we've ever seen or something that's real.
[01:53:25.101 --> 01:53:26.262]  And it's looking like it's real.
[01:53:27.523 --> 01:53:28.584]  We know it's killing some people.
[01:53:28.604 --> 01:53:30.725]  When I say real, I mean it looks like it's really lethal.
[01:53:32.046 --> 01:53:34.168]  And we know it's bioweapons grade.
[01:53:34.208 --> 01:53:35.329]  We know it's man-made.
[01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:37.711]  Notice that they don't even deny that now.
[01:53:37.731 --> 01:53:39.212]  They've just moved on from there.
[01:53:40.573 --> 01:53:44.696]  So we'll come back and do a few segments and just go call, call, call, call, call, call, call.
[01:53:45.277 --> 01:53:46.658]  In fact, let's just go to one right now.
[01:53:47.038 --> 01:53:49.560]  Let's go to JK in Washington, D.C.
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:50.541]  Thanks for holding, JK.
[01:53:50.561 --> 01:53:50.821]  Welcome.
[01:53:53.379 --> 01:53:54.700]  Alex, can you hear me?
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:55.040]  I can.
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:55.340]  Go ahead.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:55.961]  You got two minutes.
[01:53:57.081 --> 01:53:57.522]  Two minutes.
[01:53:57.642 --> 01:53:58.002]  All right.
[01:53:58.122 --> 01:54:02.164]  So, first of all, I've been buying your products since 2011, and thank you for the products.
[01:54:02.224 --> 01:54:02.625]  Thank you.
[01:54:03.045 --> 01:54:03.845]  Very effective.
[01:54:05.526 --> 01:54:07.628]  So, I have... Yeah, give me a few minutes.
[01:54:07.648 --> 01:54:08.008]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:08.648 --> 01:54:09.589]  Okay.
[01:54:09.729 --> 01:54:10.810]  Sorry, I'm here at appointment.
[01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:11.930]  I understand.
[01:54:11.970 --> 01:54:12.411]  Go ahead.
[01:54:12.431 --> 01:54:19.135]  I have a colleague at Wuhan University, and really I wanted to ask Dr. Boyle also,
[01:54:20.717 --> 01:54:25.800]  But my question is, I emailed her and she said she was fine, but this was like two weeks ago.
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:30.483]  And then I wanted to collect information, thinking that she might not be getting good information.
[01:54:30.523 --> 01:54:35.787]  And then I thought, I don't know what I can say in the email because maybe, you know, then it would get caught off.
[01:54:35.847 --> 01:54:37.348]  So that's what really my question was.
[01:54:37.988 --> 01:54:40.910]  What kind of email do I send?
[01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:42.331]  Do I just come out and say it all?
[01:54:42.952 --> 01:54:47.795]  You know, what we've learned to somebody who might not know any of this, who lives right there.
[01:54:48.784 --> 01:54:55.608]  And I wanted to find out how close the BSL-4 lab was to Wuhan University, because she's been there for many years.
[01:54:55.648 --> 01:55:05.213]  She translated my book into Chinese about information literacy, and actually got permission from the Ministry of Education, officially.
[01:55:05.253 --> 01:55:09.975]  And there's things in the book that I know the Communist Chinese wouldn't like, but I don't think it got a lot of attention.
[01:55:10.656 --> 01:55:12.497]  But anyway, that's the main thing.
[01:55:12.597 --> 01:55:13.257]  Do I just come out?
[01:55:13.277 --> 01:55:14.478]  Did you ever hear back from her?
[01:55:15.512 --> 01:55:25.157]  Yeah, she said, this was 10 days ago, she said, me and my family are fine, thank you for getting a lot of help from around the world, you know, and keep me posted.
[01:55:25.177 --> 01:55:27.738]  Yeah, I wouldn't overthink sending her stuff.
[01:55:27.758 --> 01:55:28.818]  I don't think she's going to get in trouble.
[01:55:29.139 --> 01:55:30.459]  They can't keep control of this.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:33.321]  If anything, it shows the communists don't run Jack's squad.
[01:55:34.601 --> 01:55:35.842]  So just come out and say it all.
[01:55:37.142 --> 01:55:39.443]  Just come out and tell her what we've learned.
[01:55:39.484 --> 01:55:40.724]  Well, nothing's perfect.
[01:55:40.804 --> 01:55:42.045]  I would just ask her questions.
[01:55:43.024 --> 01:55:43.425]  Hold on.
[01:55:43.445 --> 01:55:44.185]  We're going to go to a break.
[01:55:44.205 --> 01:55:45.267]  We're going to come back, J.K.
[01:55:45.647 --> 01:55:47.829]  Get a final comment from you, then everybody else stay with us.
[01:55:49.211 --> 01:55:50.793]  All right, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:55:50.853 --> 01:56:02.846]  J.K., what is your overall view on what you see happening and what you see unfolding with this virus and the big response?
[01:56:02.866 --> 01:56:03.827]  What's your gut tell you?
[01:56:06.133 --> 01:56:12.436]  Well, I go with what you guys, I mean, the expert, it was Professor Boyle, right?
[01:56:12.816 --> 01:56:14.637]  I go by what he said.
[01:56:14.737 --> 01:56:19.399]  So, in terms of the gut, I mean, there's nothing, it's not good.
[01:56:19.779 --> 01:56:22.100]  And I want to communicate with my friend.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:26.301]  Like I said, she translated my book into Chinese.
[01:56:26.401 --> 01:56:29.423]  So, you know, we connected a lot.
[01:56:29.503 --> 01:56:32.184]  And so, she said her family was fine, but this was 10 days ago.
[01:56:32.564 --> 01:56:35.065]  So, based on what you said, I'm just going to,
[01:56:36.181 --> 01:56:47.586]  Just email her and see and say what you just say all the things that we've learned, because I wanted to find out how close the BSL 4 lab was to Wuhan University, because she lives right around there.
[01:56:48.106 --> 01:56:53.049]  But the other thing, Alex, I guess is my gut is about the end times.
[01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:54.689]  So we've talked before.
[01:56:54.749 --> 01:56:57.651]  I told you I grew up in a CIA neighborhood, deep state neighborhood.
[01:56:57.991 --> 01:57:01.953]  I have a letter of recommendation from Henry Kissinger, like from 30 years ago.
[01:57:01.973 --> 01:57:04.794]  I'm not proud of it, but I'm in that world.
[01:57:05.458 --> 01:57:11.522]  So I do have to be careful, but in terms of the end times, can I bring that in and say something that I've wanted to say?
[01:57:11.562 --> 01:57:12.583]  We're not screening your call, brother.
[01:57:12.623 --> 01:57:13.683]  You're live on radio.
[01:57:15.664 --> 01:57:16.785]  Okay, Alex, listen.
[01:57:17.185 --> 01:57:23.309]  The end times needs you and people like you who are after the truth, who are seeking the truth.
[01:57:24.090 --> 01:57:30.554]  But what I want to point out about you is you have an apostle Peter-like personality.
[01:57:31.195 --> 01:57:36.476]  The difference is, you know, Peter chopped off the ear and Jesus put it back on.
[01:57:37.236 --> 01:57:41.397]  You grew up understanding Jesus, or learning about Jesus.
[01:57:41.417 --> 01:57:46.019]  So, these times is, you're needed for that.
[01:57:46.119 --> 01:57:49.920]  And you have a Peter-like, Apostle Peter-like personality.
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.380]  And that's not a bad thing, that's a good thing.
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:55.841]  That's why the guy, I'm the one who also talked to you about love your enemies.
[01:57:56.582 --> 01:58:02.443]  is probably the strongest weapon, because it's also a shield, in the end times, is love your enemies.
[01:58:02.523 --> 01:58:04.984]  That's what separates us from all the bad guys.
[01:58:05.764 --> 01:58:06.944]  So you understand that.
[01:58:07.024 --> 01:58:11.105]  I knew the guy the other day was trying to tell you how not to yell at people and whatever.
[01:58:11.145 --> 01:58:16.266]  That's not, you know, you are who you are, and you say you want to be Christ-like.
[01:58:16.606 --> 01:58:18.926]  Well, that's... I hear you, JK.
[01:58:18.966 --> 01:58:19.806]  I'm going to jump.
[01:58:19.886 --> 01:58:20.867]  Really appreciate your call.
[01:58:21.367 --> 01:58:22.747]  Austin and Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:58:22.787 --> 01:58:23.107]  Go ahead.
[01:58:25.256 --> 01:58:25.756]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:25.776 --> 01:58:26.497]  How's it going, man?
[01:58:26.517 --> 01:58:26.917]  Good, brother.
[01:58:26.937 --> 01:58:27.457]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:27.497 --> 01:58:27.837]  Go ahead.
[01:58:28.757 --> 01:58:29.238]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:30.478 --> 01:58:35.840]  If I can, I just I want to tell you how I found you online about five years ago.
[01:58:38.101 --> 01:58:43.764]  It was, you know, the YouTube rabbit hole, just New World Order type videos.
[01:58:46.065 --> 01:58:53.748]  And I saw you with Piers Morgan, the interview, and I was like, well, this this guy's different, you know, he's
[01:58:55.157 --> 01:59:01.261]  He's, uh, saying the things that I thought, and, uh... Well, that was a classic.
[01:59:01.361 --> 01:59:02.181]  Old Pierce Morgan.
[01:59:03.322 --> 01:59:14.668]  Yeah, I went to your YouTube page when you still had one, and I saw a video of you talking about the, uh, basically the black genocide with abortions, man.
[01:59:15.689 --> 01:59:19.631]  I saw you tear up, and it was the realest thing I've ever seen.
[01:59:20.892 --> 01:59:23.994]  And, uh, it's just... I'm glad you're out there.
[01:59:24.676 --> 01:59:25.537]  Oh, we're real, brother.
[01:59:25.557 --> 01:59:26.238]  Don't worry us.
[01:59:26.258 --> 01:59:28.460]  You say what you want about M4, it's real.
[01:59:29.781 --> 01:59:30.141]  We're real.
[01:59:31.303 --> 01:59:33.505]  And I love white people, black people, everybody.
[01:59:35.214 --> 01:59:39.335]  As a white person, I don't like the attacks saying whites are bad people, but I get it's all manipulation.
[01:59:40.155 --> 01:59:42.796]  But then that doesn't mean whites then bow down and say we're bad.
[01:59:42.836 --> 01:59:44.036]  We need to stand up for ourselves.
[01:59:44.076 --> 01:59:46.337]  But everybody needs to stand up for humanity.
[01:59:46.637 --> 01:59:47.477]  This is an attack.
[01:59:47.637 --> 01:59:50.277]  This whole globalist system is an attack on our babies.
[01:59:51.018 --> 01:59:56.679]  It doesn't matter what color you are, we need to come together and forget our differences and deal with the satanic left.
[01:59:57.059 --> 01:59:57.999]  They have to be dealt with.
[01:59:59.319 --> 01:59:59.740]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:02.734 --> 02:00:13.144]  I'm not real sociable, but anytime I get on Call of Duty Mobile, my Xbox Live, I send out Band-Op Video, InfoWars.com, Trump 2020.
[02:00:14.225 --> 02:00:26.777]  There's a chat board on Call of Duty Mobile, and 50% is negative, but the rest, as soon as I put Trump 2020, it just starts flowing.
[02:00:27.771 --> 02:00:28.511]  No, I agree.
[02:00:28.952 --> 02:00:36.275]  And that's why anywhere you are social, you're online playing games, your currency, because you think of that as nothing.
[02:00:36.315 --> 02:00:37.956]  Oh, I just mentioned InfoWars for Trump.
[02:00:38.016 --> 02:00:39.017]  No, that's gold.
[02:00:39.577 --> 02:00:42.338]  They want to intimidate you and stop you from that human communication.
[02:00:42.659 --> 02:00:43.799]  Well, you spread the word and do that.
[02:00:43.839 --> 02:00:44.620]  It's beautiful, Austin.
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:45.300]  Thank you so much.
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:47.061]  All right, moving quick here now.
[02:00:47.121 --> 02:00:48.942]  Let's go to Debbie in New Jersey.
[02:00:49.502 --> 02:00:53.724]  Debbie, thanks for holding your on the air worldwide on this Wednesday edition.
[02:00:55.725 --> 02:00:57.226]  I wanted to jump to this instead.
[02:00:57.625 --> 02:01:12.413]  But my gut feeling about this whole coronavirus is that how bad is it going to affect people here with all the Monsanto, the fluoride, the chemtrails, the 5G, all the poisoning they're doing to everybody here.
[02:01:12.433 --> 02:01:14.734]  I mean, that's equivalent to abortion.
[02:01:14.814 --> 02:01:18.056]  How come nobody is saying, let's have a march for health?
[02:01:18.616 --> 02:01:20.077]  Let's stop the poisoning.
[02:01:20.397 --> 02:01:21.757]  How bad are we going to be affected?
[02:01:24.099 --> 02:01:26.200]  I agree with you that something big is going on with this.
[02:01:27.242 --> 02:01:28.463]  I don't think this is all just time.
[02:01:29.304 --> 02:01:31.026]  And who knows what it could be a cover for.
[02:01:31.066 --> 02:01:31.967]  It could be something else.
[02:01:32.007 --> 02:01:32.528]  What do you think?
[02:01:35.150 --> 02:01:44.640]  I think the same thing, but it frightens me because we have so many family members that, like Rob Dua said, you have said, we can't wake up.
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:46.482]  We can't get them out of their trance.
[02:01:46.862 --> 02:01:48.664]  We've tried to turn them on to your product.
[02:01:48.804 --> 02:01:49.445]  We've given them.
[02:01:49.952 --> 02:01:51.276]  People turn their head.
[02:01:51.657 --> 02:01:52.479]  I don't want to buy from him.
[02:01:52.519 --> 02:01:53.361]  He's Alex Jones.
[02:01:53.762 --> 02:01:55.547]  How are we supposed to help these people?
[02:01:56.008 --> 02:01:57.051]  It really upsets me.
[02:01:57.776 --> 02:02:01.398]  Well, listen, it's okay because it's never going to be the majority that's awake or leaders.
[02:02:01.858 --> 02:02:04.640]  They pre-program against anybody that's good, like Trump.
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:05.920]  That's why Trump's so good.
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.442]  He's broke through all their BS.
[02:02:08.482 --> 02:02:09.482]  People know it's not true.
[02:02:09.923 --> 02:02:12.084]  And then I think they're getting weaker while we get stronger.
[02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:12.664]  But I hear you.
[02:02:12.744 --> 02:02:14.425]  Don't let it demoralize you, Debbie.
[02:02:15.826 --> 02:02:17.527]  Just know that what they say about us isn't true.
[02:02:17.547 --> 02:02:18.807]  What they say about you isn't true.
[02:02:19.228 --> 02:02:21.469]  And I just think in the end, you know, things are going to turn out okay.
[02:02:23.706 --> 02:02:26.509]  They want to bring the economy down to destroy Trump.
[02:02:26.910 --> 02:02:29.753]  My concern is this virus is already starting to do that.
[02:02:29.773 --> 02:02:33.578]  And how do they try to blame Trump of the virus?
[02:02:33.598 --> 02:02:34.579]  That's my biggest concern.
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:36.521]  I thought the same thing.
[02:02:36.641 --> 02:02:41.847]  And I was also going to say, why doesn't he utilize the black ops teams, the mercenaries?
[02:02:42.188 --> 02:02:43.830]  Those are the trained killers he needs.
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:47.120]  The problem is he's surrounded by traitors.
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:48.320]  He can't trust any of them.
[02:02:48.381 --> 02:02:53.521]  But we're entering a wheelhouse now where the deep state keeps trying to overthrow him where he won't have a choice.
[02:02:54.222 --> 02:02:58.202]  Which, I don't think we should even be happy about this, but it is what it is.
[02:02:58.762 --> 02:03:04.423]  They're bringing us to a place we don't want to go, but we didn't take us there so it's not our fault once we get there.
[02:03:04.443 --> 02:03:05.023]  Does that make sense?
[02:03:05.744 --> 02:03:05.944]  Yeah.
[02:03:06.404 --> 02:03:06.904]  No, it does.
[02:03:07.364 --> 02:03:07.644]  It does.
[02:03:07.704 --> 02:03:10.064]  Thank you for making me feel a little better.
[02:03:10.344 --> 02:03:11.265]  Oh, Debbie, you're awesome.
[02:03:11.285 --> 02:03:11.645]  God bless you.
[02:03:11.665 --> 02:03:12.305]  You've called before.
[02:03:12.345 --> 02:03:13.305]  I recognize your voice.
[02:03:13.325 --> 02:03:13.625]  Thank you.
[02:03:15.333 --> 02:03:19.056]  Alright, let's go to Georgia, New York.
[02:03:19.076 --> 02:03:20.297]  A little bit north of New Jersey.
[02:03:20.317 --> 02:03:20.997]  You're on the air, George.
[02:03:21.017 --> 02:03:21.558]  Thanks for holding.
[02:03:22.258 --> 02:03:23.739]  Yes, Alex.
[02:03:23.799 --> 02:03:25.281]  You were talking about it before.
[02:03:25.301 --> 02:03:29.524]  The guys we gotta get out of there are Zoros, Obama, Brennan.
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:34.284]  Clapper and the Clintons and then the rest are going to fall like dominoes.
[02:03:34.444 --> 02:03:34.764]  That's it.
[02:03:35.005 --> 02:03:37.547]  Yeah, we don't need a big Marines invade DC.
[02:03:37.867 --> 02:03:39.109]  We just got to go after the snake.
[02:03:39.129 --> 02:03:40.430]  And I'm not saying we're going to do it.
[02:03:40.450 --> 02:03:41.872]  And I'll say it for a place of fear.
[02:03:42.152 --> 02:03:42.853]  It's not our place.
[02:03:42.993 --> 02:03:45.275]  Trump needs to cut the head off the snake.
[02:03:46.496 --> 02:03:49.860]  And we only got four more years of Trump.
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:51.942]  What happens after the four years, Alex?
[02:03:52.643 --> 02:03:53.864]  Then we're back to square one?
[02:03:55.675 --> 02:03:58.876]  Isn't it crazy that we actually have a president that's trying to be president?
[02:03:59.237 --> 02:03:59.777]  No, I agree.
[02:03:59.817 --> 02:04:02.098]  Hell, they might election fraud.
[02:04:02.398 --> 02:04:03.178]  We have 264 days for sure, brother.
[02:04:03.198 --> 02:04:03.358]  Right.
[02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:09.642]  You know, and we can't call them Democrats no more.
[02:04:09.702 --> 02:04:10.402]  We gotta stop it.
[02:04:10.462 --> 02:04:11.423]  It's Demon Rats.
[02:04:11.663 --> 02:04:12.724]  This is the new word.
[02:04:12.844 --> 02:04:13.545]  Demon Rats.
[02:04:13.625 --> 02:04:15.346]  We need to call them Demon Rats.
[02:04:15.366 --> 02:04:15.926]  No, I agree.
[02:04:15.986 --> 02:04:24.412]  When a party says they don't want the country to exist, which would bankrupt everybody, just from a financial level, what do you do with people like that?
[02:04:24.452 --> 02:04:25.853]  It's not like we want to fight with them.
[02:04:26.654 --> 02:04:29.336]  We have to kick their ass, prove we're tough, but they keep asking for it.
[02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:34.092]  Also, we can't let lawyers run this country.
[02:04:34.112 --> 02:04:37.936]  This is what's been going on with a small guy like me.
[02:04:38.456 --> 02:04:42.159]  You know, you can't fight because everything is you need a lawyer.
[02:04:42.179 --> 02:04:43.921]  You need a lawyer for this, a lawyer for that.
[02:04:43.961 --> 02:04:46.803]  So they are ruining this country, these lawyers.
[02:04:46.823 --> 02:04:49.045]  You're right, they paralyzed the nation.
[02:04:49.466 --> 02:04:51.247]  Well, they're getting their asses kicked right now.
[02:04:51.267 --> 02:04:54.810]  I mean, the lawyers thought they could remove Trump.
[02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:55.571]  How'd that go for them?
[02:04:56.181 --> 02:04:57.342]  Right.
[02:04:57.542 --> 02:05:01.045]  But look at Roger Stone, look at Julian Assange.
[02:05:01.205 --> 02:05:06.869]  I mean, you know, if you're on Trump's side, they go after you, they go after the good people.
[02:05:07.149 --> 02:05:14.755]  So a lot of people like us, we got to keep our mouths shut because we don't have the firepower to hire lawyers.
[02:05:14.855 --> 02:05:15.636]  I agree with George.
[02:05:16.036 --> 02:05:16.496]  Great point.
[02:05:16.516 --> 02:05:17.037]  God bless you.
[02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:19.551]  It was probably like eight, nine months ago.
[02:05:19.571 --> 02:05:24.193]  They had the Department of Justice under these people investigating my dad, who did nothing.
[02:05:24.213 --> 02:05:25.594]  He's not even involved with the company much.
[02:05:26.094 --> 02:05:28.156]  He does some bookkeeping and then product development.
[02:05:28.516 --> 02:05:29.796]  But they knew I loved my dad.
[02:05:30.037 --> 02:05:34.359]  And I just, I told him, I said, I told him, I said, Dad, you ready to go to prison?
[02:05:34.399 --> 02:05:35.420]  He goes, yeah, I'm ready.
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:36.620]  I go, yeah, we're not backing down.
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:39.342]  And they went, and the system was like, really?
[02:05:39.662 --> 02:05:40.862]  You don't care about your daddy?
[02:05:41.223 --> 02:05:43.484]  And I said, he's an old man, he's ready to go.
[02:05:45.505 --> 02:05:46.806]  I said, you can literally,
[02:05:48.472 --> 02:05:53.376]  I went crazy, actually, but I'm not going to get into what happened behind the scenes, but they realized I don't care about me.
[02:05:54.597 --> 02:05:58.080]  So they thought they'd mess with my dad, and my dad was like, destroy me.
[02:05:58.100 --> 02:05:59.741]  It was totally made up.
[02:05:59.761 --> 02:06:01.162]  They're like, we're going to indict your father.
[02:06:02.506 --> 02:06:05.287]  And that's the level of the scum.
[02:06:05.587 --> 02:06:08.188]  You cannot even imagine the filth.
[02:06:08.608 --> 02:06:16.590]  And you just thank your Jesus every moment that you weren't born to families like these people who are the greatest scum the planet has ever seen.
[02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:21.151]  They are self-loathing pieces of crap that have sold the country out.
[02:06:24.676 --> 02:06:26.037]  What the hell is this?
[02:06:27.018 --> 02:06:28.279]  You guys are out of control.
[02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:31.381]  Two final phone calls before I punch you out of here.
[02:06:34.364 --> 02:06:36.385]  That Mike Adams, always informative, taking over.
[02:06:36.766 --> 02:06:38.667]  Nick in Massachusetts, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:06:38.687 --> 02:06:42.430]  Hi, Alex.
[02:06:43.371 --> 02:06:43.912]  Welcome, Nick.
[02:06:44.672 --> 02:06:54.280]  Hi, I just wanted to say that I've been listening to you since... I want to say the Jesse Ventura Conspiracy Theory Show, and I want to say thank you for, you know,
[02:06:55.126 --> 02:07:12.886]  Opening my eyes to the real evil of the world and I just had a comment about the coronavirus and what I think that the UN is going to probably start making laws for us to, you know, force vaccines to whatever they want to put into our bodies and however they want to manipulate our genes.
[02:07:13.852 --> 02:07:33.956]  And, um, I don't know if you've seen recently on the MSN website that Bill Gates has got this $645 million superyacht, and I know you've been saying for years that when they decide to start this push of, like, depopulating people, that these super-rich are just going to jump on these mega-yachts and just, you know, ride around the ocean.
[02:07:34.016 --> 02:07:34.756]  Oh, that's it.
[02:07:34.976 --> 02:07:37.656]  Yeah, it's not like Moonraker, where they go out to space to do it.
[02:07:38.016 --> 02:07:40.097]  They're going to sit on their yachts while we all die.
[02:07:40.277 --> 02:07:40.837]  Absolutely.
[02:07:41.903 --> 02:07:45.946]  They're not going to wait in bunkers underground, underground bases.
[02:07:46.006 --> 02:07:46.986]  They're going to be on their yachts.
[02:07:47.006 --> 02:07:47.227]  Yes.
[02:07:48.067 --> 02:07:57.834]  And I just wanted to comment that with the picture that like the MSN has been kind of like showing around it, it actually looks like the, the, the art, the arcs that they've made in the movie 2012.
[02:07:58.014 --> 02:08:04.138]  Um, I don't know if you're familiar with the movie, but it, it, it, they, they, they look like a spaceship.
[02:08:04.158 --> 02:08:07.380]  They don't, they don't really, and it's like the first hydrogen powered, um,
[02:08:12.202 --> 02:08:16.242]  I just wanted to say thank you.
[02:08:16.562 --> 02:08:22.684]  I'm from a small town in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, and I just want to let you know that your words are coming out to us this way.
[02:08:23.204 --> 02:08:24.564]  Nick, I want to thank you, brother.
[02:08:24.584 --> 02:08:25.444]  That's what it's all about.
[02:08:25.524 --> 02:08:27.225]  We love you, and I appreciate you.
[02:08:27.265 --> 02:08:27.905]  Thanks for the call.
[02:08:28.325 --> 02:08:29.905]  All right, Jordan in New Jersey.
[02:08:29.985 --> 02:08:33.606]  You're our last caller before Mike Adams takes over.
[02:08:33.666 --> 02:08:34.266]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:08:35.507 --> 02:08:35.967]  Hi, Alex.
[02:08:36.007 --> 02:08:36.687]  Jordan Brewster here.
[02:08:37.935 --> 02:08:39.536]  Man, it's a crazy time to be alive.
[02:08:39.576 --> 02:08:45.738]  I'm just remembering that movie 2012, and the yachts looked like escape pods, and that's just what Bill Gates' yacht looks like.
[02:08:45.798 --> 02:08:47.798]  I'm like, what the hell's going on here?
[02:08:47.818 --> 02:08:48.879]  It's pretty crazy.
[02:08:49.779 --> 02:08:55.481]  Yeah, well, you've seen a lot, and I've been with you a long time, you know, since about, I guess, 9-11.
[02:08:55.601 --> 02:08:58.722]  So, when my eyes got opened, and I appreciate you taking the journey with me.
[02:09:00.419 --> 02:09:15.049]  So, I just want to start with, I just want to implore you and all the other independent media out there and all citizen journalists not to merely react to the barrage of world events, both created and natural.
[02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:16.630]  No, I agree.
[02:09:16.670 --> 02:09:17.831]  How are we proactive?
[02:09:17.871 --> 02:09:18.732]  How do we get ahead of it?
[02:09:19.993 --> 02:09:21.774]  Yeah, this is my suggestion to all this.
[02:09:22.274 --> 02:09:23.395]  I'm an attorney.
[02:09:23.555 --> 02:09:26.077]  I also have a master's in information library science.
[02:09:26.604 --> 02:09:36.829]  It's very key that we try to hone something called information literacy, which I think that you do as best you can, but you have to deal with a barrage of a 24-hour, you know, 24-7 news cycle.
[02:09:37.629 --> 02:09:45.012]  So, I mean, lest we forget the anthrax attacks that we just heard about, that we all were reminiscing about, unfortunately, with your last guest.
[02:09:46.273 --> 02:09:49.734]  Cesar Sayoc, Jr., with the pipe bombs, right?
[02:09:50.135 --> 02:09:53.196]  The uptick to the whole House of Representatives election.
[02:09:53.932 --> 02:09:55.614]  And obviously the El Paso shooting.
[02:09:56.695 --> 02:09:58.256]  They're going to launch false flags.
[02:09:59.637 --> 02:10:07.704]  Yes, and we need something to sit, whether it be an institute or 501c3 formed by folks like you and other like-minded people.
[02:10:08.263 --> 02:10:11.264]  To go ahead and examine these things in long durations.
[02:10:11.304 --> 02:10:12.625]  You've done some very good films.
[02:10:13.025 --> 02:10:19.708]  You haven't really had the time to do your last good film, Endgame, which is, to me, the last really big effort that you were able to do.
[02:10:19.728 --> 02:10:20.488]  You're right.
[02:10:20.528 --> 02:10:24.490]  They don't want us studying these events because so many times they're staged.
[02:10:25.956 --> 02:10:26.557]  Precisely.
[02:10:26.717 --> 02:10:32.683]  And what happens is they continuously manipulate the public because of the shorter attention span and so forth.
[02:10:32.723 --> 02:10:40.892]  But History Commons, I don't know if you ever went to that site, but they put together many great timelines starting with 9-11 and so forth.
[02:10:41.313 --> 02:10:43.495]  Although it's not very palpable to the average citizen.
[02:10:44.119 --> 02:10:51.744]  So, through the prism of something called information literacy, something I studied as an information scientist student, and did my doctorate on, basically.
[02:10:51.764 --> 02:10:53.386]  I'll tell you what, give us your name and number.
[02:10:53.826 --> 02:10:56.068]  You'll be our first guest caller tomorrow at like 11.30.
[02:10:56.328 --> 02:10:58.890]  If you'll do it, come on for a couple of segments with us tomorrow.
[02:10:59.470 --> 02:11:00.551]  I really appreciate you, George.
[02:11:00.611 --> 02:11:01.371]  You're a smart guy.
[02:11:01.671 --> 02:11:02.452]  Get his name and number.
[02:11:02.732 --> 02:11:04.714]  Tomorrow, 11.30, if he'll do it, he's on.
[02:11:04.854 --> 02:11:05.214]  Stay with us.
[02:11:06.375 --> 02:11:08.416]  All right, and welcome everyone.
[02:11:08.476 --> 02:11:09.197]  InfoWarriors.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.321]  The Real Patriots of America.
[02:11:11.361 --> 02:11:16.383]  This is Mike Adams here filling in for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:11:16.684 --> 02:11:18.945]  I've got a lot of great information for you here.
[02:11:19.125 --> 02:11:24.368]  And first of all, let me just say the callers to this show are truly amazing.
[02:11:24.428 --> 02:11:30.651]  It's amazing how much information that you get and how you're observing and you're thinking critically about the world.
[02:11:31.383 --> 02:11:41.231]  And yet you live in a world, and you know this, where so many people, their eyes just glaze over, they're hypnotized into zombie status somehow.
[02:11:41.791 --> 02:11:53.701]  I was actually talking last night in a private conversation with a very high-level finance person who's a big name, you would know them, they work with people who
[02:11:54.796 --> 02:11:57.518]  Manage, I don't know, hundreds of billions of dollars.
[02:11:58.158 --> 02:12:05.183]  And they were asking for my take on things, because they said they were talking to people, and it was like talking to zombies.
[02:12:05.663 --> 02:12:12.948]  And I said, yes, those people are what we call non-player characters, NPCs, from the old role-playing games.
[02:12:13.629 --> 02:12:19.032]  You know, NPCs, or also known as programmable lifeforms, PLFs.
[02:12:19.753 --> 02:12:21.374]  It's because they have no soul.
[02:12:21.454 --> 02:12:22.655]  They literally have no soul.
[02:12:23.314 --> 02:12:28.818]  They are programmed empty skin bags, and there's a whole bunch of those in society, and you encounter them.
[02:12:28.878 --> 02:12:29.918]  You know it when you do it.
[02:12:30.119 --> 02:12:37.824]  When someone, you're talking to someone, like, you know, their eyes are open, but no one's home, and you're trying to explain things.
[02:12:37.844 --> 02:12:41.566]  You're like, hey, this coronavirus, you know, this thing, it's spreading.
[02:12:41.606 --> 02:12:42.887]  It's doubling about every week.
[02:12:43.508 --> 02:12:44.548]  It's spreading like crazy.
[02:12:44.568 --> 02:12:45.669]  There's a massive cover-up.
[02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:46.870]  It's a biological weapon.
[02:12:47.250 --> 02:12:51.313]  And then they turn to you and say something like, well, I don't feel like it's going to be that bad.
[02:12:52.436 --> 02:12:56.257]  Really, I'm not sure that the virus cares about what you feel about things.
[02:12:56.517 --> 02:13:13.401]  It's almost so bad that if there were an asteroid hurtling toward planet Earth, moving at a relative velocity of, let's say, 30,000 meters per second, and it's 100 miles wide, and all the scientists say it's going to hit New York City, let's just say theoretically,
[02:13:14.102 --> 02:13:17.784]  And you would go across New York, but let's say it's going to hit in 30 days.
[02:13:18.345 --> 02:13:28.091]  If you were to go to New York with a microphone and ask people, hey, what do you think about that giant asteroid that's going to hit the city here and basically destroy all life on Earth?
[02:13:28.431 --> 02:13:29.272]  What do you think about that?
[02:13:29.692 --> 02:13:32.714]  You would find people that would say, I don't think it's going to be that bad.
[02:13:34.135 --> 02:13:36.517]  They would literally line up and say,
[02:13:38.490 --> 02:13:39.230]  I'm not seeing it.
[02:13:39.370 --> 02:13:39.871]  I don't see it.
[02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:41.272]  I look at the sky, it's not there.
[02:13:41.832 --> 02:13:44.654]  There would be people who would say nothing bad is going to happen.
[02:13:44.715 --> 02:13:49.078]  Or they would say, don't worry, FEMA is going to bring us bottled water after the meteor hits.
[02:13:49.798 --> 02:13:52.420]  And you would explain to them the rules of cause and effect.
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:14:09.232]  You would explain that kinetic energy is one-half mass times velocity squared, and if the velocity is 30,000 meters per second, and the mass of an asteroid that's 100 miles wide is just huge, then this thing is a planet killer.
[02:14:09.813 --> 02:14:10.874]  That it's going to kill the whole planet.
[02:14:10.894 --> 02:14:13.816]  You would explain that to them, and you would say it's heading here, it's going to hit here.
[02:14:14.574 --> 02:14:19.777]  And even if they believe those facts, they would still say, nah, it's probably not going to be that bad.
[02:14:20.677 --> 02:14:22.838]  So this is what's happening in our world.
[02:14:23.799 --> 02:14:34.584]  Whether we're talking about the coronavirus or the coming financial collapse that will happen probably within our lifetimes, we don't know what year, we don't know when, but fiat currencies collapse, it's going to be devastating.
[02:14:34.904 --> 02:14:36.125]  The debt pyramid will collapse.
[02:14:36.865 --> 02:14:39.506]  The spread of this disease, it's devastating.
[02:14:39.866 --> 02:14:42.908]  But the average person does not prepare
[02:14:43.590 --> 02:14:46.239]  Because they can't fathom these things happening.
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:49.971]  So, in this hour today here on InfoWars...
[02:14:51.061 --> 02:15:04.048]  I'm going to share with you why you don't have to be worried about the coronavirus killing you, because I will talk about some natural molecules found in nature that easily halt this virus.
[02:15:04.088 --> 02:15:06.790]  I've been doing some research on this, working in my lab.
[02:15:07.530 --> 02:15:12.212]  We know about some natural cures already, things that work, things that you can do today.
[02:15:12.232 --> 02:15:16.455]  That doesn't require buying anything, just changing what you eat.
[02:15:16.495 --> 02:15:17.455]  I'll talk about that here.
[02:15:18.236 --> 02:15:20.517]  But realize that other people won't be prepared.
[02:15:21.329 --> 02:15:23.871]  Other people are living on total junk food.
[02:15:23.911 --> 02:15:25.172]  They don't believe in nutrition.
[02:15:26.033 --> 02:15:32.317]  And they don't believe that this virus is spreading because, for some reason, they think that communists in China always tell the truth.
[02:15:33.438 --> 02:15:34.079]  Which is insane.
[02:15:34.359 --> 02:15:35.860]  They think the WHO is telling the truth.
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:46.128]  So the real big picture here, folks, is that this virus probably won't kill you because you will be informed, because you're a listener to this show.
[02:15:46.804 --> 02:15:49.604]  You read websites that help keep you informed.
[02:15:49.765 --> 02:15:51.905]  We can teach you how to survive this.
[02:15:51.945 --> 02:15:52.765]  It's not that difficult.
[02:15:52.845 --> 02:15:56.086]  Even if you do nothing, your chances of survival are 83%.
[02:15:56.826 --> 02:15:57.106]  All right?
[02:15:57.426 --> 02:16:01.807]  Because it's about a 17% kill rate, maybe a 15% kill rate.
[02:16:01.827 --> 02:16:06.607]  So that means your chances of survival are 83 to 85% if you do nothing.
[02:16:07.748 --> 02:16:15.929]  If you take some nutrients and change what you eat and do some of the things I'll recommend here, your chances of surviving an infection
[02:16:16.696 --> 02:16:19.339]  Go up, in my assessment, to at least 99%.
[02:16:21.161 --> 02:16:23.243]  At least 99%, maybe even better.
[02:16:23.884 --> 02:16:35.437]  So you are extremely unlikely to be killed by this virus, even if it spreads all across America, even if it infects 60% of the global population, as has been warned by Dr. Leong out of Hong Kong.
[02:16:37.515 --> 02:16:44.297]  Your chances of being clobbered by the downfall of society are much higher than 1%, you see.
[02:16:44.677 --> 02:16:55.400]  Because when other people get sick, and other people don't prepare, and then they panic and go to the grocery store to buy food that isn't there because they don't have any storable food.
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:58.401]  They freak out because they've never thought about self-reliance.
[02:16:58.441 --> 02:17:00.041]  They depend on the government.
[02:17:00.501 --> 02:17:02.262]  And they think the government's going to come save them.
[02:17:02.282 --> 02:17:04.342]  And they don't even have a means of self-defense.
[02:17:04.882 --> 02:17:06.643]  Those unprepared masses
[02:17:07.478 --> 02:17:09.679]  Are the biggest threat to your safety and survival.
[02:17:10.819 --> 02:17:19.881]  So that's the theme of today's show here at least the hour that I have been given and that I that I humbly serve the audience of InfoWars here today.
[02:17:20.262 --> 02:17:24.523]  The theme of it is you won't be killed by the virus do some simple things.
[02:17:24.563 --> 02:17:29.044]  We'll talk about but you're still living in a world where most people are unprepared.
[02:17:29.690 --> 02:17:31.410]  They're unprepared for the pandemic.
[02:17:31.430 --> 02:17:36.632]  They're unprepared for a grid-down collapse, a solar flare, an EMP weapon.
[02:17:37.152 --> 02:17:42.033]  Totally unprepared for a financial collapse and all the other things, the scenarios that we've talked about over the years.
[02:17:42.593 --> 02:17:46.674]  So your job is to think beyond the pandemic.
[02:17:47.434 --> 02:17:54.015]  Think beyond the coronavirus and think about secondary effects and how those could impact your life.
[02:17:54.636 --> 02:17:56.356]  This is the time to be a prepper.
[02:17:56.883 --> 02:18:00.125]  This is the time to have extra supplies before they're sold out.
[02:18:00.905 --> 02:18:10.591]  This is the time to take steps for self-reliance that do not depend on dialing 911 and having people show up to rescue you.
[02:18:11.091 --> 02:18:12.592]  Because that is very unlikely to happen.
[02:18:12.932 --> 02:18:21.297]  I'm also going to talk today about how China is certain to turn this into a biological weapons attack against the United States.
[02:18:21.997 --> 02:18:24.959]  Because if you think about this, after this sweeps through China,
[02:18:26.127 --> 02:18:33.491]  They may lose 15% of their population, but after that's done, all Chinese in mainland China are now immune.
[02:18:34.491 --> 02:18:36.852]  Because you're either dead or you're immune, one or the other.
[02:18:37.533 --> 02:18:42.615]  After everybody dies, they've got 85% of their population, let's say, that's immune.
[02:18:43.216 --> 02:18:47.878]  Now China can launch this as a weapon against any nation.
[02:18:47.938 --> 02:18:53.901]  They could even launch invasions of nations because their troops will now be immune to the virus.
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:19:05.430]  So by paying the price of allowing this to spread across China, which is exactly what they're doing, they are creating a nation, the world's first nation, of immune citizens.
[02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:08.172]  And trust me, China will weaponize this.
[02:19:08.693 --> 02:19:10.514]  They will deploy this against the United States.
[02:19:11.215 --> 02:19:13.056]  And there is nothing that the U.S.
[02:19:13.116 --> 02:19:20.103]  can do to stop this virus if it is weaponized and deliberately released across 100 U.S.
[02:19:20.143 --> 02:19:21.504]  cities simultaneously.
[02:19:22.569 --> 02:19:23.770]  Even the CDC would tell you.
[02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.571]  They would admit.
[02:19:24.971 --> 02:19:26.732]  There's nothing that they can do to stop that.
[02:19:27.453 --> 02:19:34.118]  The CDC's ability to stop this depends on compliance from people who don't want the virus to spread.
[02:19:35.258 --> 02:19:41.283]  If you have people that come in and deliberately want it to spread, there is no containment that's possible.
[02:19:41.783 --> 02:19:45.486]  There is nothing the CDC can do to stop that, and they would admit that.
[02:19:45.966 --> 02:19:48.068]  And believe me, at the highest levels of government right now,
[02:19:49.164 --> 02:20:03.116]  Inside the Pentagon, inside the State Department, inside the National Security Council, they know somebody is going to harvest this biological weapon system, this coronavirus that was engineered, and they are going to release it in the United States.
[02:20:03.883 --> 02:20:05.223]  As soon as possible.
[02:20:05.803 --> 02:20:07.844]  Are you ready for that scenario?
[02:20:08.364 --> 02:20:18.966]  Are you ready for a malicious assault against our country using this virus that frankly some people in China, they believe falsely, but they believe that the US dropped this on China.
[02:20:19.466 --> 02:20:21.227]  They think it's a bioweapon from the US.
[02:20:21.607 --> 02:20:23.787]  So of course they want revenge in their minds.
[02:20:24.287 --> 02:20:26.308]  They're going to deploy this against the United States.
[02:20:26.728 --> 02:20:27.948]  We'll talk about that scenario.
[02:20:29.099 --> 02:20:36.162]  And some very practical things that you can do to protect yourself against this infection when we return after this short break.
[02:20:36.182 --> 02:20:36.942]  This is Mike Adams.
[02:20:37.363 --> 02:20:40.304]  You're watching InfoWars, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:40.624 --> 02:20:41.104]  Stay with us.
[02:20:41.144 --> 02:20:43.065]  We'll be back with more good information.
[02:20:44.876 --> 02:20:57.864]  One of the interesting things that Francis Boyle mentioned in the interview that you saw earlier on this show today is that, in his view, this coronavirus pandemic will probably be worse than the Spanish flu of 1918.
[02:20:58.885 --> 02:21:10.392]  Now, if you go back and look at the numbers there, that flu infected about 500 million people, half a billion people, which was roughly about a third of the global population at the time.
[02:21:11.337 --> 02:21:18.061]  It had a kill rate, or what's called a mortality rate, of about 10 percent, killing an estimated 50 million people.
[02:21:18.761 --> 02:21:19.402]  That was 1918.
[02:21:20.622 --> 02:21:25.145]  Francis Boyle says this is probably going to be worse, and I think that he may be correct about that.
[02:21:25.665 --> 02:21:35.551]  This is certainly lining up to be much worse because, of course, now we have a global population of, let's just say roughly, let's just rough out the edges of it to 7.5 billion people.
[02:21:36.351 --> 02:21:38.833]  So one-third of 7.5 billion people is 2.5 billion people.
[02:21:41.658 --> 02:21:42.819]  Could get infected with this.
[02:21:42.939 --> 02:21:48.281]  Actually, the real number may be much higher, according to, for example, Dr. Leong out of Hong Kong.
[02:21:48.782 --> 02:21:54.245]  Could be 60% of the world population, even up to 80% of the world population infected.
[02:21:54.605 --> 02:21:56.166]  But let's just go with 1 third.
[02:21:56.566 --> 02:21:58.147]  Alright, just to be conservative about this.
[02:21:58.607 --> 02:22:00.708]  So let's say 2.5 billion people get infected.
[02:22:01.414 --> 02:22:12.659]  Well, out of 2.5 billion people, if you have a mortality rate of 10%, well, then that's 250 million deaths all around the world.
[02:22:12.959 --> 02:22:13.639]  I mean, think about it.
[02:22:13.659 --> 02:22:17.301]  A quarter of a billion people.
[02:22:17.541 --> 02:22:18.061]  250 million deaths.
[02:22:19.341 --> 02:22:25.264]  That's a lot of dead souls, and yet we're told that this has all been conquered.
[02:22:25.845 --> 02:22:28.047]  It's all now totally under control.
[02:22:28.627 --> 02:22:41.117]  China is fudging the numbers daily now to show a trend, a downward trend, even as the truth about their infections is that it hasn't even peaked in China and the infections have only begun outside of China.
[02:22:42.138 --> 02:22:42.779]  It's really incredible.
[02:22:43.279 --> 02:22:47.221]  But people say, well, none of that will happen now because this isn't 1918.
[02:22:48.282 --> 02:22:50.963]  And we have better testing technology today.
[02:22:51.483 --> 02:22:52.864]  We have better medicine.
[02:22:53.244 --> 02:22:54.425]  We have better vaccines.
[02:22:54.545 --> 02:22:55.846]  We have better hospitals.
[02:22:56.206 --> 02:22:56.486]  Okay.
[02:22:57.407 --> 02:23:10.494]  So this morning, Dr. Messonnier from the CDC just alerted journalists all across the world that the CDC has been shipping out test kits to all 50 states, hundreds of thousands of test kits.
[02:23:11.115 --> 02:23:17.500]  She admitted this morning, and by the way, I have to say, she's been one of the more honest and transparent scientists.
[02:23:17.861 --> 02:23:21.284]  She admitted those test kits don't work in many cases.
[02:23:21.584 --> 02:23:24.006]  They produce false positives and false negatives.
[02:23:24.682 --> 02:23:26.683]  Because the reagents are bad.
[02:23:27.083 --> 02:23:30.704]  The reagents are normally the little powdered chemicals that you add to the test kits.
[02:23:31.204 --> 02:23:35.106]  And some local doctors or clinicians are unable to follow the directions.
[02:23:35.226 --> 02:23:35.846]  Imagine that.
[02:23:36.366 --> 02:23:39.007]  We live in a nation now where people can't follow directions.
[02:23:39.527 --> 02:23:48.750]  So if the test kit says, you know, swab the patient's throat, put the swab in this vial, add... I'm just guessing because I'm a lab scientist.
[02:23:48.810 --> 02:23:50.291]  I've run these kinds of tests before.
[02:23:50.311 --> 02:23:50.551]  Let's say,
[02:23:51.211 --> 02:23:58.696]  Add 5 milliliters of water and 5 milliliters of methanol, or whatever, alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, whatever the solvent might happen to be.
[02:23:59.136 --> 02:24:00.958]  Shake it up for 30 seconds.
[02:24:01.278 --> 02:24:03.419]  Transfer it with a pipette to another vial.
[02:24:03.879 --> 02:24:06.141]  Add 1.2 grams of this reagent.
[02:24:06.521 --> 02:24:07.962]  Vortex it for 30 seconds.
[02:24:08.442 --> 02:24:13.366]  Incubate it at whatever temperature for how many minutes, and then compare it to this color chart.
[02:24:13.786 --> 02:24:14.746]  That's your answer, okay?
[02:24:14.987 --> 02:24:18.549]  Those steps, which are very common in these kinds of lab tests,
[02:24:19.631 --> 02:24:24.883]  Those steps are unable to be followed by most people working in clinics today, believe it or not.
[02:24:25.684 --> 02:24:29.453]  Again, we live in a country where the average young person can't change a tire.
[02:24:30.456 --> 02:24:34.879]  And we also live in a country where people can't follow directions who work in hospitals and clinics.
[02:24:35.259 --> 02:24:37.640]  And so you get what's called false positives and false negatives.
[02:24:38.161 --> 02:24:41.903]  A false positive says that you have the virus when you don't.
[02:24:42.483 --> 02:24:50.889]  So you get dragged off into a quarantine center and stuffed in essentially a jail cell with a bunch of other people who really are infected, even though you're not.
[02:24:51.249 --> 02:24:53.030]  And guess what happens after 24 hours?
[02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:54.851]  Oh, now you're really infected.
[02:24:55.726 --> 02:24:58.428]  So then they say, well, the test must have been accurate.
[02:24:58.468 --> 02:24:59.348]  See, you're infected now.
[02:24:59.689 --> 02:25:04.051]  No, you morons, you threw me in a quarantine camp with a bunch of truly infected people.
[02:25:04.371 --> 02:25:05.472]  So that's a false positive.
[02:25:06.453 --> 02:25:09.875]  A false negative is even more dangerous for society as a whole.
[02:25:10.315 --> 02:25:14.618]  A false negative is that they said you don't have the virus when you do.
[02:25:15.416 --> 02:25:20.739]  So the CDC test kit used in a local clinic or a hospital sends you home.
[02:25:20.799 --> 02:25:21.399]  Don't worry!
[02:25:21.819 --> 02:25:25.641]  All that coughing and fever and diarrhea that you have, don't worry.
[02:25:25.741 --> 02:25:26.862]  It's not the coronavirus.
[02:25:27.162 --> 02:25:28.663]  Our test kit just proved it.
[02:25:29.023 --> 02:25:38.208]  You can go home, go to that party, go to that reunion, go to movie theaters, whatever, go back to work, you know, shake hands with people on a professional basis.
[02:25:38.588 --> 02:25:39.148]  You're fine.
[02:25:39.609 --> 02:25:41.309]  Turns out that person has the virus.
[02:25:41.970 --> 02:25:43.551]  And then, of course, they're spreading it everywhere, but
[02:25:45.046 --> 02:25:49.630]  If they're asked by any official, they will say, no, I tested negative because the test kits are bad.
[02:25:50.411 --> 02:25:51.992]  Now, why are the test kits bad?
[02:25:52.012 --> 02:26:01.981]  And by the way, this means, you know, all this advanced technology, all this advanced science and medicine and everything, it's pointless if the test kits don't work, right?
[02:26:02.242 --> 02:26:03.042]  It's pointless.
[02:26:03.823 --> 02:26:10.369]  Because it used to be you would send a sample to the CDC lab in Atlanta and they would have like a three-day turnaround.
[02:26:11.297 --> 02:26:18.079]  And then we get backlogged, so it ends up being like two to three weeks turnaround in some cases, except for high priority samples.
[02:26:18.739 --> 02:26:23.281]  And they would use like a DNA analysis, PCR, replication, gene sequencer type of instrument.
[02:26:23.821 --> 02:26:27.662]  And, you know, it takes about three days roughly, maybe two to three days to get results on that.
[02:26:27.702 --> 02:26:29.243]  But the results were accurate.
[02:26:29.883 --> 02:26:33.104]  So in two to three days, you could get almost 100% accurate results.
[02:26:34.662 --> 02:26:35.944]  But now they have test kits.
[02:26:36.124 --> 02:26:39.468]  In four to five hours, you can get a 50% false negative rate.
[02:26:42.848 --> 02:26:43.908]  This is called progress.
[02:26:44.349 --> 02:26:54.432]  So I guess, according to this, I should start a new company that sells kits that have a 99% failure rate, but deliver results in two minutes.
[02:26:54.932 --> 02:26:59.034]  And that would be a trillion dollar IPO because no doubt China would buy those test kits.
[02:26:59.054 --> 02:27:00.194]  They would say, this is awesome.
[02:27:00.514 --> 02:27:02.435]  Our infection numbers are falling everywhere.
[02:27:02.935 --> 02:27:03.656]  This is awesome.
[02:27:03.676 --> 02:27:03.976]  Look at that.
[02:27:03.996 --> 02:27:05.296]  We've got this thing licked.
[02:27:06.217 --> 02:27:07.337]  And speaking of China, by the way,
[02:27:08.334 --> 02:27:12.796]  So China pushed their biotech companies to rush these test kits out.
[02:27:12.856 --> 02:27:20.998]  Now, normally, these test kits require two to three years to develop and test and validate using clinical trials.
[02:27:21.498 --> 02:27:22.579]  Two to three years.
[02:27:23.359 --> 02:27:26.420]  China decided, well, we need these in two to three weeks.
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:33.623]  So they pushed their biotech companies to produce these test kits in two to three weeks, and they sent them out all over China.
[02:27:33.843 --> 02:27:34.403]  And guess what?
[02:27:34.423 --> 02:27:35.803]  50 to 70% false negative rate.
[02:27:38.757 --> 02:27:40.097]  Because they weren't tested.
[02:27:40.477 --> 02:27:41.678]  They weren't validated.
[02:27:42.118 --> 02:27:43.298]  They are a joke.
[02:27:43.698 --> 02:27:46.759]  But it allows China to be able to say, well, guess what?
[02:27:46.799 --> 02:27:48.139]  The infections are falling.
[02:27:48.419 --> 02:27:48.919]  Look at that.
[02:27:48.999 --> 02:27:49.939]  The infections are falling.
[02:27:50.139 --> 02:27:53.000]  The test kits are showing us that there are hardly any infections anymore.
[02:27:53.260 --> 02:28:00.161]  And that's what you're seeing in the numbers released by China as they have shifted from the gene sequencing instruments to these failed test kits.
[02:28:00.441 --> 02:28:02.602]  So that's why the numbers are falling in China.
[02:28:02.902 --> 02:28:03.162]  Get it?
[02:28:03.843 --> 02:28:04.584]  It's on purpose.
[02:28:05.084 --> 02:28:13.190]  China probably ordered those biotech companies to produce tests that would result in false negatives because that's the goal they want.
[02:28:13.230 --> 02:28:15.051]  They want to be able to say this thing is solved.
[02:28:15.672 --> 02:28:21.236]  So now China is reopening factories.
[02:28:21.986 --> 02:28:26.851]  And soon they're gonna just force people to go back to work at gunpoint and say, we gotta keep the factories running.
[02:28:27.271 --> 02:28:29.073]  Because if we don't, we're gonna lose our economy.
[02:28:29.533 --> 02:28:33.417]  They know that this thing is still spreading, and it's going to spread at the factories.
[02:28:33.878 --> 02:28:37.501]  But they're gonna have, you know, gunpoint soldiers in there, get to work!
[02:28:38.282 --> 02:28:41.285]  A gun at your head, work until you literally drop dead.
[02:28:42.037 --> 02:28:43.677]  Because they have to keep the factories running.
[02:28:44.178 --> 02:28:51.019]  They know China has already realized they're going to lose 5 to 10 to 15 percent of their population.
[02:28:51.299 --> 02:28:52.919]  This is so far beyond containment.
[02:28:53.380 --> 02:29:02.642]  They're going to lose millions of lives, but they're going to keep the factories running at all costs, even if they have to drag dead bodies off the assembly lines to keep those factories running.
[02:29:02.822 --> 02:29:03.842]  They've made that decision.
[02:29:03.862 --> 02:29:06.943]  That's what they're going to do, which means this will never be contained.
[02:29:07.343 --> 02:29:08.463]  This is going global.
[02:29:09.494 --> 02:29:10.314]  More straight ahead.
[02:29:10.354 --> 02:29:10.835]  Stay with us.
[02:29:11.235 --> 02:29:13.116]  We'll be back after this brief break.
[02:29:14.616 --> 02:29:29.743]  While the brainwashed masses are waiting around 18 months for the pharmaceutical industry to come up with a vaccine that probably won't work, but it will be laced with toxic ingredients, you could be doing things right now to enhance your health by changing your diet.
[02:29:29.843 --> 02:29:31.903]  And that's the subject of this segment.
[02:29:32.264 --> 02:29:32.884]  Thank you for joining me.
[02:29:32.924 --> 02:29:37.846]  Mike Adams here from Natural News on the Alex Jones Show with solutions for coronavirus.
[02:29:38.590 --> 02:29:43.192]  Now, I've been doing a lot of research the last few days on certain molecules.
[02:29:43.652 --> 02:29:45.333]  I study molecules all the time in the lab.
[02:29:45.593 --> 02:29:47.794]  I run multiple mass spec instruments.
[02:29:47.834 --> 02:29:50.775]  We do time of flight mass spec, triple quad mass spec.
[02:29:50.815 --> 02:29:56.598]  We do pesticide analysis, CBD analysis for quantitation of cannabinoids and things like that.
[02:29:56.638 --> 02:29:58.618]  So I'm very familiar with this area of research.
[02:29:59.139 --> 02:30:06.802]  And I was looking at what are the most likely natural molecules that can inhibit the enzymatic
[02:30:07.583 --> 02:30:08.723]  We're good to go.
[02:30:37.341 --> 02:30:54.590]  So back in 2003, when SARS first had its outbreak, and remember, SARS is a coronavirus, and it shares about 80% of the genetic code, which means the protein structure, with the current Wuhan coronavirus, NCOV coronavirus, or whatever new name they have now.
[02:30:54.630 --> 02:31:00.633]  They keep changing the name every day to try to distance it from China, by the way, so they keep coming up with new names.
[02:31:01.273 --> 02:31:04.815]  But if you go back and look at the research on SARS, it's quite fascinating.
[02:31:05.422 --> 02:31:23.453]  After the SARS outbreak at that time, China itself funded a tremendous amount of research into natural herbs and foods, substances, various molecules, various bioflavonoids, for example, typically from fruits, Chinese medicine substances, also prescription drugs as well.
[02:31:23.893 --> 02:31:26.075]  They tested every chemical they could think of against SARS.
[02:31:27.170 --> 02:31:37.915]  And they found quite a few molecules that would have a very strong inhibitory effect against the 3Cl protease process in the body.
[02:31:38.655 --> 02:31:40.856]  And right now I'm documenting those.
[02:31:40.876 --> 02:31:42.777]  I'm going to share a few with you here today.
[02:31:43.177 --> 02:31:48.520]  But I'm doing more research and more documentation so that I can present this publicly with good research behind it.
[02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:51.441]  Lots of papers out there on this right now.
[02:31:52.502 --> 02:31:53.182]  So the good news is
[02:31:54.438 --> 02:32:01.381]  You don't have to be killed by this and there is good, steady research right now about what can work.
[02:32:01.982 --> 02:32:02.982]  And so let me give an example.
[02:32:03.582 --> 02:32:08.265]  One of the interesting things here is I found a theoretical research paper that was doing protein modeling.
[02:32:08.645 --> 02:32:11.766]  This is a theoretical paper, not a clinical trial.
[02:32:12.247 --> 02:32:21.031]  But it found that one of the food chemicals that can function theoretically to help stop this virus is called Urbacitin.
[02:32:22.228 --> 02:32:25.229]  Erbasitin, H-E-R-B-A-C-E-T-I-N.
[02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:28.631]  Turns out it's a phytochemical found in flaxseed.
[02:32:29.491 --> 02:32:35.394]  So you can eat flaxseed right now and you can get erbasitin in your body at some level.
[02:32:35.994 --> 02:32:41.476]  Now I haven't tested flaxseed for what concentration of erbasitin is found in flaxseed.
[02:32:42.097 --> 02:32:46.398]  It might be that you have to eat pounds of flaxseed to get a therapeutic dose of this.
[02:32:46.438 --> 02:32:47.579]  I don't know the answer to that yet.
[02:32:48.174 --> 02:32:51.115]  But the truth is, it can't hurt to eat flaxseed.
[02:32:51.135 --> 02:32:51.535]  That's the thing.
[02:32:51.915 --> 02:32:59.996]  There's no risk, there's no downside to eating healthier, and you're going to get some nutrients that may actually work to block this virus.
[02:33:00.016 --> 02:33:02.457]  So that's one of them, herbacitin, in flaxseed.
[02:33:02.817 --> 02:33:12.119]  And by the way, flaxseed is rich with omega-3s, and it protects your heart, it helps prevent type 2 diabetes, I mean, it stabilizes blood sugar.
[02:33:13.159 --> 02:33:14.100]  Flaxseed is amazing.
[02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:17.022]  I put some in my smoothie every day, and I've been doing it for years.
[02:33:17.323 --> 02:33:19.444]  I'm drinking ground-up flaxseed every day.
[02:33:19.464 --> 02:33:21.826]  And not just flax oil, by the way.
[02:33:22.266 --> 02:33:25.849]  Flax lignans, flax fiber, is very good for you.
[02:33:26.170 --> 02:33:29.432]  So, you know, part of this is eat more flax, okay?
[02:33:29.892 --> 02:33:34.656]  Now, then some critic would say, well, you're telling people to eat flaxseed and not take the vaccine.
[02:33:35.937 --> 02:33:37.398]  You moron, there is no vaccine.
[02:33:38.079 --> 02:33:41.421]  But you can get flaxseed at the grocery store right now, so do what you can now.
[02:33:42.605 --> 02:33:45.666]  It doesn't mean that you can't consider other options later on.
[02:33:45.966 --> 02:33:47.567]  You can consider prescription drugs.
[02:33:47.607 --> 02:33:49.947]  You could consider a vaccine if you want to take that risk.
[02:33:50.287 --> 02:33:52.968]  You can consider all those things, but you can eat flax too.
[02:33:53.628 --> 02:33:55.389]  It's called complementary medicine.
[02:33:55.909 --> 02:33:59.190]  You can have food and nutrients that work for this.
[02:33:59.970 --> 02:34:06.212]  And by the way, speaking of food, there's another bioflavonoid that we found in the research that is found in orange peels.
[02:34:07.153 --> 02:34:08.693]  And I actually did an article on this.
[02:34:08.933 --> 02:34:11.094]  It's mentioned in a patent
[02:34:11.958 --> 02:34:19.301]  of an antiviral sanitizing spray that you can spray on the surface and it kills coronavirus.
[02:34:20.121 --> 02:34:30.586]  So this is known to kill viruses on surfaces and it's a patented formulation based on bioflavonoids, mostly from citrus peels.
[02:34:31.726 --> 02:34:33.147]  So when I found that, you know what I did?
[02:34:33.547 --> 02:34:38.489]  I went out and I ordered certified organic orange peel granules.
[02:34:39.622 --> 02:34:45.585]  And as soon as I get those, I'm going to be mixing those into my smoothies, because you know how you can have orange zest as a spice?
[02:34:46.045 --> 02:34:52.869]  You know, a lot of meals, you know, I don't know, high-end chefs or something, high-end restaurants, they'll have some orange zest on your food.
[02:34:53.509 --> 02:35:01.053]  Well, turns out that orange peel, although not typically considered a food, you wouldn't want to make a meal out of it, but you could buy candied orange peels, for example.
[02:35:01.514 --> 02:35:05.696]  You can use orange zest as a spice, and it's full of nutrients.
[02:35:06.784 --> 02:35:10.206]  And some of these nutrients have an antiviral effect.
[02:35:10.906 --> 02:35:11.546]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:35:12.106 --> 02:35:13.507]  So, and that's just another example.
[02:35:13.807 --> 02:35:15.848]  Again, I have a lot more research on this.
[02:35:16.688 --> 02:35:17.409]  Here's something else.
[02:35:17.769 --> 02:35:24.372]  We found that there is a tree, I'm not going to name it yet, but there's a tree that grows in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan.
[02:35:24.992 --> 02:35:30.514]  The bark of this tree naturally synthesizes a molecule that kills coronavirus.
[02:35:31.475 --> 02:35:33.596]  And this wood has a very special smell.
[02:35:33.636 --> 02:35:36.057]  I've actually got samples of it right next door here.
[02:35:37.105 --> 02:35:38.085]  It has a very special smell.
[02:35:38.125 --> 02:35:41.066]  It's used in exotic wood carving and wood furniture.
[02:35:41.106 --> 02:35:50.128]  When I visited temples in Taiwan, when I lived there, I remember the smell because that was the furniture was carved out of this very, very special exotic wood.
[02:35:50.648 --> 02:35:53.148]  And it's used in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and even China.
[02:35:53.608 --> 02:35:56.509]  This wood contains a chemical that kills coronavirus.
[02:35:56.929 --> 02:36:01.810]  So isn't it interesting that the people in the countries that are being hit by this virus
[02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:08.389]  They are living among trees that are already growing the cure for free, naturally.
[02:36:08.909 --> 02:36:10.710]  And yet, they're waiting for a vaccine.
[02:36:11.250 --> 02:36:20.054]  And many of them will die waiting for a vaccine or waiting for a drug because they don't recognize the medicine that's already there all around them, indigenous to the area.
[02:36:20.755 --> 02:36:23.036]  Mother Nature's already put the cures there.
[02:36:23.336 --> 02:36:25.137]  We just have to be wise enough to recognize them.
[02:36:25.357 --> 02:36:27.378]  Now, some practical things about food.
[02:36:28.578 --> 02:36:29.999]  Many of the molecules that we're finding
[02:36:30.689 --> 02:36:30.970]  All right.
[02:36:45.979 --> 02:36:52.946]  You patriotic Americans out there, people who love America, I want you to eat Middle Eastern food for a while.
[02:36:52.986 --> 02:36:54.268]  I want you to eat Indian cuisine.
[02:36:54.288 --> 02:37:00.715]  I want you to go to a Pakistani grocery store, which has an amazingly potent smell because those are the herbs in the jars.
[02:37:01.155 --> 02:37:04.839]  I want you to buy the mixes, buy the herbs, buy the curries.
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:08.523]  I want you to go load up on all these exotic
[02:37:09.252 --> 02:37:11.773]  Food recipes and mixes from the Middle East.
[02:37:13.054 --> 02:37:15.495]  Again, maybe you can find Afghanistan food.
[02:37:15.775 --> 02:37:16.256]  I'm not sure.
[02:37:16.296 --> 02:37:21.538]  But this food contains natural antiviral molecules.
[02:37:22.419 --> 02:37:24.840]  You should be eating this food.
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:30.583]  Because if you live on pancakes and corn syrup and frosted flakes, that's not going to help you.
[02:37:30.643 --> 02:37:33.544]  That's just garbage processed food and carbohydrates.
[02:37:34.145 --> 02:37:37.166]  The medicine is in the potent, pungent spices.
[02:37:38.307 --> 02:37:38.947]  And in fact,
[02:37:40.322 --> 02:37:40.842]  It's amazing.
[02:37:41.042 --> 02:37:49.486]  I found a spice, I bought a sample, a spice that is so potent that contains a molecule that combats coronavirus.
[02:37:49.847 --> 02:37:53.909]  I'm not prepared to name this particular spice yet, but I'll give you a hint.
[02:37:54.269 --> 02:37:58.651]  It's used as a flavoring agent in exotic Russian gin.
[02:37:59.602 --> 02:38:01.064]  It's because the taste is amazing.
[02:38:01.104 --> 02:38:09.376]  It's like an explosion of all kinds of phytochemicals and phytonutrients in your mouth and it contains antiviral nutrients in this spice.
[02:38:09.696 --> 02:38:14.703]  It's known as a spice and it's used in certain exotic recipes throughout the Middle East.
[02:38:15.004 --> 02:38:15.665]  So literally,
[02:38:16.405 --> 02:38:26.914]  While you're waiting for Big Pharma to fumble around with failed tests and toxic vaccines, you can be eating your way to a defensive posture to defend yourself against this virus.
[02:38:27.434 --> 02:38:28.435]  Change what you eat.
[02:38:28.835 --> 02:38:35.441]  Go for the spices, the pungent mixes, the orange zest, you know, the herbs that work, the superfoods.
[02:38:35.941 --> 02:38:38.163]  This can literally help save your life.
[02:38:38.443 --> 02:38:39.844]  I'll be back after this break with more.
[02:38:40.144 --> 02:38:40.605]  Stay with us.
[02:38:42.327 --> 02:38:49.537]  We're going to talk about the bioweapons aspect of this, and to the producers there, pull up an article from the Epoch Times from J.R.
[02:38:49.957 --> 02:38:57.368]  Nyquist, and the article is, I believe, entitled, Did China's Bioweapons Experiment Backfire?
[02:38:58.035 --> 02:39:05.840]  Because you see, China has had a long-term plan to eliminate America using biological warfare weapons, such as this.
[02:39:06.321 --> 02:39:14.006]  And in fact, that's the reason why China was building these biowarfare research centers that they claimed were all about public health.
[02:39:14.927 --> 02:39:19.550]  In truth, they're all about building biological weapons to ultimately destroy the United States.
[02:39:20.010 --> 02:39:20.490]  And J.R.
[02:39:20.551 --> 02:39:21.031]  Nyquist,
[02:39:21.815 --> 02:39:24.576]  Who has a book, by the way, that I really want to read.
[02:39:24.996 --> 02:39:26.736]  I think you can get it on Amazon and other places.
[02:39:27.296 --> 02:39:40.680]  He talks about the history, I think in the 1990s, a top military official from China was explaining that China and the United States cannot both exist in the future of this world because the U.S.
[02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:42.320]  is opposing China's expansion.
[02:39:42.992 --> 02:39:49.922]  China wants to conquer Taiwan, for example, and expand to the Spratly Islands and even conquer really other nations, by the way.
[02:39:50.262 --> 02:39:54.268]  But China wants to conquer the moon, too, which is the high ground above planet Earth.
[02:39:55.385 --> 02:40:01.428]  China is being held in check by the United States, which is the world's strongest military force by far.
[02:40:01.969 --> 02:40:19.138]  And this is why China has built aircraft carrier factories, where they can roll aircraft carriers off their factory line at some insane rate, like one every year or something, which would eventually dwarf the number of aircraft carriers that the United States Navy operates.
[02:40:19.158 --> 02:40:21.179]  I don't know what that number is, but it's not a huge number.
[02:40:21.739 --> 02:40:25.602]  You know, all the aircraft carriers in the world is a very small number.
[02:40:25.923 --> 02:40:27.764]  It's not a common thing.
[02:40:28.545 --> 02:40:34.129]  So China has long-term plans to destroy the United States, and they thought they could do it with a biological weapon.
[02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:35.971]  That's why they were researching this.
[02:40:36.351 --> 02:40:43.177]  But then, of course, they accidentally released it, because there's no quality control in China, and it infected them.
[02:40:43.577 --> 02:40:46.960]  However, it's not too late for them to still deploy this.
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:50.323]  In fact, according to my analysis, here's what's going to happen next.
[02:40:51.002 --> 02:41:02.093]  China will first seek to export this pandemic to other nations outside of China in order to divert blame for the global pandemic that's coming.
[02:41:02.113 --> 02:41:12.724]  So what China's going to do is fudge the numbers, show smaller and smaller numbers itself, and then issue press releases and declarations to say, oh, we've conquered it.
[02:41:13.504 --> 02:41:14.844]  But look at these other countries.
[02:41:14.904 --> 02:41:18.285]  Look at Singapore and Malaysia and Japan.
[02:41:18.685 --> 02:41:19.845]  They're the problem.
[02:41:20.066 --> 02:41:22.546]  They're the ones spreading it now, even though it's all a big lie.
[02:41:22.986 --> 02:41:25.667]  Actually, Taiwan is doing a great job controlling this.
[02:41:26.027 --> 02:41:27.167]  Japan is as well.
[02:41:28.067 --> 02:41:29.448]  Indonesia, not so much.
[02:41:29.628 --> 02:41:37.129]  But Hong Kong's trying to protect themselves, but they've got, you know, the common border with China and a lot of, you know, communist China control there.
[02:41:37.650 --> 02:41:39.430]  But China is going to divert blame.
[02:41:40.157 --> 02:41:46.401]  By spreading the virus deliberately to other countries, so that those countries get blamed for the global wave.
[02:41:47.702 --> 02:41:57.309]  Once the global wave happens, China can then, and this is my analysis, this is what I think they will do, because I know the pure evil that these communists are.
[02:41:57.889 --> 02:42:01.532]  China will have a hundred volunteers, let's say.
[02:42:02.205 --> 02:42:07.609]  Who don't yet have the virus or are willing to be re-injected with it or to spread it.
[02:42:08.089 --> 02:42:20.678]  We'll have a hundred volunteers to go into the United States with the virus in their bodies or with maybe little nebulizers like nasal spray, you know, squeezable plastic bottles that are loaded with a virus, whatever.
[02:42:21.198 --> 02:42:28.143]  And they'll be sent to a hundred cities across America with instructions to go touch everything that the public touches.
[02:42:28.724 --> 02:42:30.525]  Touch the handrails, touch the door
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:31.700]  I think?
[02:43:01.676 --> 02:43:04.638]  Trump needs to know this information because this wave is coming.
[02:43:05.119 --> 02:43:08.401]  And if it's not China, it's going to be North Korea or Iran or someone else.
[02:43:09.162 --> 02:43:25.614]  And then, when America starts to suffer the economic problems that China is already suffering, China can blame America for China's own economic implosion that will threaten the very existence of its communist power structure.
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:28.723]  Because they will say, look, America's having problems.
[02:43:28.803 --> 02:43:32.707]  People aren't going out and shopping and they're not buying Chinese made products.
[02:43:32.947 --> 02:43:35.470]  That's why our economy is going down here in China.
[02:43:35.790 --> 02:43:41.777]  That's why we're not able to meet the goal of doubling our GDP in 10 years or whatever, whatever claim they were trying to make.
[02:43:42.896 --> 02:43:45.356]  So, right now, the goal is to divert blame.
[02:43:45.857 --> 02:43:47.837]  And China doesn't care how many people they kill.
[02:43:47.957 --> 02:43:50.057]  In fact, they want to kill Americans.
[02:43:50.477 --> 02:43:52.958]  They've had a long-term plan to kill Americans.
[02:43:53.358 --> 02:43:58.299]  And a long-term plan to invade Taiwan, conquer that independent nation.
[02:43:58.859 --> 02:44:02.320]  In fact, they've got the World Health Organization convinced that Taiwan is part of China.
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:03.780]  How insane is that?
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:08.161]  These countries that are banning flights to China, they're including Taiwan in those flights.
[02:44:08.221 --> 02:44:09.641]  Taiwan's not even part of China.
[02:44:10.276 --> 02:44:17.043]  Taiwan's an independent nation that's been trying to free itself from the oppression of communism for, you know, generations now.
[02:44:17.623 --> 02:44:24.730]  But that's China's plan, is to conquer all the nations around it and destroy America and eventually occupy American soil.
[02:44:25.090 --> 02:44:27.733]  Take over America after destroying America.
[02:44:28.474 --> 02:44:29.555]  This biological weapon
[02:44:30.422 --> 02:44:37.324]  As long as China is willing to lose up to 15% of its own population, gives it the perfect weapon to now achieve this goal.
[02:44:37.764 --> 02:44:40.324]  That's why I say, this is coming to America.
[02:44:40.725 --> 02:44:42.025]  There is no stopping it.
[02:44:43.685 --> 02:44:48.106]  Because there are forces that want to destroy America, and they know now that everything is at stake.
[02:44:48.867 --> 02:44:52.347]  Plus, on top of that, you have the globalist depopulation goals.
[02:44:52.988 --> 02:44:54.488]  They want to depopulate America too.
[02:44:54.528 --> 02:44:56.148]  They want to plunge America into chaos.
[02:44:56.248 --> 02:44:58.549]  In fact, they want to do it before the election.
[02:44:59.562 --> 02:45:14.995]  Because if they can cause enough economic chaos, they might be able to have Trump defeated even by some left-wing loser like Joe Biden, who was just beaten like a dog in the street or something in the caucus, the primaries.
[02:45:15.515 --> 02:45:22.561]  I mean, Joe Biden can't get votes from Democrats, much less, you know, centrists or independents.
[02:45:23.462 --> 02:45:27.886]  But if they could crush the economy, if they could cause panic, if they could
[02:45:28.869 --> 02:45:34.873]  Blame Trump for all this, and Trump's lack of action to solve this, then they might have a leg up on this.
[02:45:34.913 --> 02:45:41.076]  So the coronavirus fits into the strategies of China, as well as the globalists, as well as the Democrats.
[02:45:41.577 --> 02:45:45.199]  You can bet the DNC right now would love to see a pandemic in America.
[02:45:45.619 --> 02:45:46.079]  No kidding.
[02:45:46.660 --> 02:45:47.260]  I mean, come on.
[02:45:47.420 --> 02:45:51.563]  The DNC, they murder people who have information on Democrats.
[02:45:52.143 --> 02:45:53.584]  Andrew Breitbart, for example.
[02:45:53.904 --> 02:45:55.145]  Andrew Breitbart was taken out.
[02:45:56.132 --> 02:45:59.533]  Because he had dirt on Obama that would have ended Obama's presidency.
[02:45:59.913 --> 02:46:00.654]  It killed Breitbart.
[02:46:01.674 --> 02:46:02.554]  Breitbart was a good man.
[02:46:02.734 --> 02:46:04.095]  He was trying to sound the alarm.
[02:46:04.515 --> 02:46:10.137]  He made the tactical mistake of announcing that he had this video 48 hours before he was going to release it.
[02:46:11.277 --> 02:46:13.258]  You never do that, folks, because that's when they kill you.
[02:46:13.658 --> 02:46:16.419]  That's why I don't do that, and frankly, I don't have any such videos.
[02:46:16.839 --> 02:46:19.360]  If I did, I would have already released them for that very reason.
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:21.501]  I don't have anything that could get me killed.
[02:46:21.601 --> 02:46:23.821]  I just put it all out there, let the world decide.
[02:46:24.121 --> 02:46:25.702]  You know, like Project Veritas, right?
[02:46:26.297 --> 02:46:30.298]  But the thing is, this weapon is coming to America.
[02:46:31.018 --> 02:46:33.518]  And yet, most Americans are in a total state of denial.
[02:46:33.818 --> 02:46:35.279]  They don't realize what's going to happen.
[02:46:36.199 --> 02:46:38.319]  Even now, I find it fascinating.
[02:46:38.339 --> 02:46:44.280]  The Wall Street Journal is catching up to InfoWars on reporting that China is lying about its own numbers.
[02:46:44.941 --> 02:46:45.641]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:46:46.201 --> 02:46:52.542]  So what InfoWars reported and what Natural News reported two weeks ago is now being confirmed by the Wall Street Journal?
[02:46:53.533 --> 02:46:58.696]  And the New York Times, and maybe even the Washington Post soon, as they realize China is lying.
[02:46:59.217 --> 02:47:01.238]  But they're not covering what you're hearing here.
[02:47:01.618 --> 02:47:02.719]  Why is China lying?
[02:47:03.019 --> 02:47:17.968]  Because China needs to export the disease, divert blame, and infect the rest of the world, so that China doesn't take the historical blame for this, even while China will be losing potentially, if it's uncontrolled in China, over a hundred million Chinese people.
[02:47:19.369 --> 02:47:22.971]  Put in vans, and carted off to crematoriums,
[02:47:23.925 --> 02:47:29.427]  I mean, we're talking about scenes like the Holocaust here, with numbers that dwarf the Holocaust.
[02:47:30.448 --> 02:47:36.331]  You know, according to official estimates, the Holocaust in, you know, late 1930s and 1940s was what?
[02:47:36.391 --> 02:47:42.633]  Six million Jews were taken to ovens and concentration camps and so on, murdered by the Nazi regime.
[02:47:43.994 --> 02:47:52.678]  The communist China regime is willing to have a hundred million of its own people killed in order to keep the factories running
[02:47:53.644 --> 02:47:56.985]  So that it can continue its strategy of global domination.
[02:47:58.206 --> 02:48:01.127]  And sadly, Trump is late to the game on this.
[02:48:01.627 --> 02:48:07.209]  He is being advised by liars in his administration who aren't telling him the truth about this.
[02:48:07.569 --> 02:48:09.509]  Trump doesn't know how serious this is.
[02:48:09.930 --> 02:48:16.752]  And that's part of the reason why I come on here at Infowars and urge the people around the President to let him know what's happening.
[02:48:17.172 --> 02:48:22.814]  China is going to allow potentially a hundred million people to die so that they don't lose
[02:48:23.582 --> 02:48:31.756]  Their economic power to eventually conquer and crush the United States of America, and they will likely release this biological weapon in the United States.
[02:48:32.578 --> 02:48:34.942]  And I believe that is likely to happen this year.
[02:48:35.891 --> 02:48:38.011]  For political reasons related to the election.
[02:48:38.212 --> 02:48:39.552]  So I hope I'm wrong about all this.
[02:48:39.592 --> 02:48:42.152]  I hope that the communists aren't that evil.
[02:48:42.552 --> 02:48:43.653]  But history shows they are.
[02:48:44.153 --> 02:48:46.693]  They mass murder people anytime they need power.
[02:48:46.953 --> 02:48:47.794]  That's what history shows.
[02:48:48.334 --> 02:48:52.675]  I mean, how do you think the communist government got into power in China by mass murdering millions of people?
[02:48:52.915 --> 02:48:53.775]  Of course they'll do it again.
[02:48:54.535 --> 02:48:57.656]  But this is the only place you're going to hear this analysis, even though it's historically accurate.
[02:48:58.236 --> 02:48:58.816]  Thanks for watching.
[02:48:58.836 --> 02:49:00.656]  Mike Adams here for InfoWars.com.
[02:49:01.377 --> 02:49:02.377]  War Room coming up next.
[02:49:02.637 --> 02:49:03.017]  Stay with us.
[02:49:15.202 --> 02:49:18.964]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:49:19.504 --> 02:49:22.725]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:49:22.985 --> 02:49:25.666]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:49:26.267 --> 02:49:29.128]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:49:29.808 --> 02:49:31.469]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:49:32.049 --> 02:49:33.510]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:49:34.131 --> 02:49:39.235]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:49:39.615 --> 02:49:47.542]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:49:48.082 --> 02:49:54.467]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:49:54.788 --> 02:49:57.610]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:50:09.218 --> 02:50:23.142]  Something big's about to happen, and I'm not sure it's this virus, but we need to have our bases covered with the virus.
[02:50:24.270 --> 02:50:29.754]  And, you know, I said I would talk about this because this is an important decision for all of you out there to think about and decide what you're going to do.
[02:50:29.894 --> 02:50:31.034]  This is in Congress.
[02:50:31.194 --> 02:50:32.855]  This is 13 years ago.
[02:50:33.076 --> 02:50:33.996]  And this is the company.
[02:50:34.136 --> 02:50:38.559]  And when I got this information four or five days ago, I said, listen, are you sure you want me to do this?
[02:50:38.759 --> 02:50:41.061]  Because you've got Department of Defense contracts.
[02:50:41.081 --> 02:50:41.841]  You've got a lot of others.
[02:50:42.001 --> 02:50:42.702]  They might mess with you.
[02:50:42.722 --> 02:50:44.202]  I'm like, no, no, you know, we're the owners.
[02:50:44.603 --> 02:50:45.203]  We like what you're doing.
[02:50:45.223 --> 02:50:46.104]  We've got a partnership with you.
[02:50:46.164 --> 02:50:49.346]  We want people to know how important this is of the Department of Defense.
[02:50:50.046 --> 02:50:55.612]  And Congressional reports say that this product, NanoSilver, has been found to knock out SARS.
[02:50:56.073 --> 02:50:57.455]  Well, no crap, Sherlock.
[02:50:57.475 --> 02:50:58.336]  Of course it does.
[02:50:58.516 --> 02:50:59.777]  Viruses, bacteria, you name it.
[02:50:59.877 --> 02:51:02.200]  Nobody's selling 16 ounces of NanoSilver.
[02:51:02.300 --> 02:51:02.961]  It's patented.
[02:51:02.981 --> 02:51:04.302]  This is the top company in the U.S.
[02:51:04.322 --> 02:51:04.603]  that we're...
[02:51:04.963 --> 02:51:05.343]  Private label.
[02:51:05.363 --> 02:51:06.664]  This is something they developed with my dad.
[02:51:06.724 --> 02:51:07.344]  The Immune Gargle.
[02:51:07.464 --> 02:51:08.045]  But here's the deal.
[02:51:08.145 --> 02:51:13.148]  Department of the Army Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command, Tampa Point Boulevard.
[02:51:13.288 --> 02:51:16.950]  And it goes into Andrew C. von Edenbach, Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration.
[02:51:17.090 --> 02:51:25.455]  And they go on to say that with antibiotic resistance and all the rest of it, we have found that this particular type of nanosilver is effective against SARS and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[02:51:25.575 --> 02:51:26.676]  Then it goes on here.
[02:51:26.836 --> 02:51:29.517]  The Texas A&M System Health Science Center.
[02:51:29.677 --> 02:51:32.619]  And it says confidential because they don't want this type of stuff out for a
[02:51:32.639 --> 02:51:33.759]  We're good to go.
[02:51:57.307 --> 02:51:58.668]  It's the grace of God that stuff like this happens.
[02:51:58.688 --> 02:52:00.028]  This is the top company, folks.
[02:52:23.860 --> 02:52:25.041]  And they're like, no, just say who we are.
[02:52:25.061 --> 02:52:28.063]  Robert Keith Moeller, CEO, American Biotech Labs, LLC.
[02:52:28.083 --> 02:52:28.704]  That's the big one.
[02:52:28.724 --> 02:52:32.107]  They're the only ones that have approved, over-the-counter, super silver womb gel.
[02:52:32.147 --> 02:52:33.347]  Do not take this internally.
[02:52:33.367 --> 02:52:39.773]  This is super, well, let's just say what it is, poisonous to bacteria and viruses, which means it ain't too good for you, but it's better than dying, right?
[02:52:40.293 --> 02:52:41.894]  So this goes on the hands and things.
[02:52:41.914 --> 02:52:42.775]  It's a protective shield.
[02:52:42.795 --> 02:52:45.177]  If you get cut or something, your micro scratches, it seals it in.
[02:52:45.277 --> 02:52:48.199]  But all the other products, they're all discounted right now during this crisis.
[02:52:48.279 --> 02:52:49.000]  Infowarshort.com.
[02:53:29.966 --> 02:53:35.457]  I didn't just start selling storable food to the audience last month or six months ago or a year ago.
[02:53:36.439 --> 02:53:40.527]  I've been selling storable food to people that believe they need to get it.
[02:53:41.704 --> 02:53:43.826]  I've been doing that for 20 plus years.
[02:53:44.087 --> 02:53:47.050]  Because it made sense to me to have insurance you can eat during any crisis.
[02:53:47.230 --> 02:53:49.312]  And we hope Trump and America wins.
[02:53:49.372 --> 02:53:50.994]  We hope the globalists get defeated.
[02:53:51.094 --> 02:53:58.562]  But in a war like this, there isn't any arming that wins a war, politically or militarily, that doesn't have food backing it up.
[02:53:58.683 --> 02:54:00.324]  And so that's what we're talking about here.
[02:54:01.946 --> 02:54:03.927]  ...went into Russia, he ran out of food, he failed.
[02:54:04.287 --> 02:54:06.488]  Hitler went into Russia, he ran out of food, he failed.
[02:54:06.629 --> 02:54:09.750]  So, you know, Adam Schiff wants us to defeat the Russians, we need lots of food to do that.
[02:54:09.870 --> 02:54:11.431]  No, we need to defeat the Adam Schiffs of the world.
[02:54:11.511 --> 02:54:15.293]  Because if you don't have food, they control you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:15.393 --> 02:54:17.715]  So, I believed in storable food 20-something years ago.
[02:54:17.735 --> 02:54:18.455]  Got it myself.
[02:54:18.635 --> 02:54:19.836]  It's insurance you can always eat.
[02:54:19.896 --> 02:54:26.041]  But then I noticed that even though there were big, reputable companies, during a big spike they'd make people wait months to get their food and they'd play games.
[02:54:26.181 --> 02:54:31.986]  Well, going back more than 11 years ago, they've been around 12 years, my Patriot Supply came along and promised to be different.
[02:54:32.346 --> 02:54:34.968]  And I slowly worked with them for a couple years to test them out.
[02:54:35.389 --> 02:54:37.531]  And now, 10, 11 years later, they're the best.
[02:54:38.251 --> 02:54:39.913]  And again, it's like everything that's the best.
[02:54:40.473 --> 02:54:44.837]  You could have a nexus point, like a graph, like what's the lowest price versus what's the best quality.
[02:54:45.198 --> 02:54:49.121]  There's some stuff that I pointed out costs way more, 3, 4, 5, 6 times more.
[02:54:49.402 --> 02:54:50.102]  It's like gourmet.
[02:54:50.142 --> 02:54:51.183]  It's ridiculous how good it is.
[02:54:51.564 --> 02:54:52.284]  But it costs way more.
[02:54:52.945 --> 02:54:54.646]  But on a nexus point, this is right in the middle.
[02:54:55.487 --> 02:55:00.192]  Super low-cost, the lowest you're gonna find for any decent food, and it's really good, high-quality stuff.
[02:55:00.212 --> 02:55:01.133]  Some stuff's like gourmet.
[02:55:01.173 --> 02:55:02.834]  It's like, damn, I eat this every day.
[02:55:02.854 --> 02:55:03.875]  Other stuff's like, yeah, it's pretty good.
[02:55:04.296 --> 02:55:10.682]  The point is, it's really good, and it's not a scam, and they're people that are smart and want a long-term relationship.
[02:55:10.742 --> 02:55:12.163]  You buy it at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:55:12.223 --> 02:55:13.665]  They're in the back end of our computers.
[02:55:13.825 --> 02:55:14.926]  It's my Patriot Supply.
[02:55:15.006 --> 02:55:19.030]  We just get some of the money to fund our operation when you buy it there, InfoWare Store, and they ship it out to you.
[02:55:19.090 --> 02:55:21.051]  They've got food for another 12 days or so.
[02:55:21.111 --> 02:55:21.851]  They're honest about that.
[02:55:21.951 --> 02:55:24.211]  What they don't have is the people to pack it.
[02:55:24.311 --> 02:55:31.553]  So they're going 24 hours a day at their three factories in the United States, one in Utah, the other two big ones, and that's what's happening.
[02:55:31.613 --> 02:55:33.874]  No, they're there, and they're taking your orders.
[02:55:33.914 --> 02:55:39.215]  The other big companies just instantly, when institutions called, big corporations, governments called, they sold out.
[02:55:39.255 --> 02:55:40.696]  The chat comms bought up all the mass.
[02:55:40.716 --> 02:55:41.896]  They've tried to buy up all the food they can.
[02:55:42.056 --> 02:55:42.216]  Great!
[02:55:42.296 --> 02:55:43.277]  The Chinese need food.
[02:55:43.417 --> 02:55:43.677]  I get it.
[02:55:43.717 --> 02:55:44.277]  They're shipping over there.
[02:55:44.338 --> 02:55:44.758]  That's great.
[02:55:44.918 --> 02:55:51.823]  We are selling food to the American people, and that's the message and the mission of Tim Redhawk, the founder, and their CEO, that's coming on with us next second.
[02:55:51.903 --> 02:55:54.404]  But this is something that is the trifecta.
[02:55:54.504 --> 02:55:56.165]  It's great food you and your family need.
[02:55:56.386 --> 02:56:02.990]  It funds the information war, and at the same time, it gives you the confidence to know that you're taking care of yourself and your family.
[02:56:03.070 --> 02:56:03.991]  So, it's that simple.
[02:56:04.071 --> 02:56:05.492]  It's called Ready Power.
[02:56:06.152 --> 02:56:09.758]  Now, we used to call it InfoWars Select because I could get around the rules they had at their company.
[02:56:09.778 --> 02:56:13.064]  People were even lower in the prices to dominate the market.
[02:56:13.104 --> 02:56:14.106]  I am their biggest distributor.
[02:56:14.266 --> 02:56:15.488]  That's how we fund this operation.
[02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:19.915]  But they came to me and they said, that's boosting the price to have to private label it.
[02:56:21.513 --> 02:56:22.294]  Not the private labeling.
[02:56:22.314 --> 02:56:23.154]  Just call it what we call it.
[02:56:23.414 --> 02:56:23.794]  Ready Hour.
[02:56:23.915 --> 02:56:24.275]  So we do.
[02:56:24.595 --> 02:56:26.016]  You just order it at Infoworkstore.com.
[02:56:26.596 --> 02:56:27.737]  It funds our whole operation.
[02:56:28.418 --> 02:56:29.598]  And it really is excellent.
[02:56:29.658 --> 02:56:30.379]  It's super high quality.
[02:56:30.399 --> 02:56:33.061]  They have special meals for special diets and so much more.
[02:56:33.101 --> 02:56:33.821]  They have four weeks.
[02:56:33.861 --> 02:56:34.541]  They have three months.
[02:56:34.802 --> 02:56:35.362]  They have four months.
[02:56:35.382 --> 02:56:35.942]  They have six months.
[02:56:35.962 --> 02:56:36.503]  They have years.
[02:56:36.983 --> 02:56:42.607]  This is something everyone should do to invest in their future and to begin the road towards preparedness.
[02:56:42.867 --> 02:56:43.908]  Because the Chinese say,
[02:56:44.628 --> 02:56:47.370]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:56:47.711 --> 02:56:52.054]  Well, getting swearable food and firearms is more than the single step.
[02:56:55.136 --> 02:56:57.418]  InfoWars.
[02:56:59.060 --> 02:57:01.782]  The most banned network in the world.
