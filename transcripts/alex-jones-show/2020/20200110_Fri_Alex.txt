[00:00:03.171 --> 00:00:24.276]  I think we cannot overemphasize the fact that that we really don't have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions because we're not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine and this always gets blown up in the media.
[00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:30.437]  One should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the cause of
[00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:31.545]  That's all.
[00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.148]  But in most cases, there's some obfuscation at that level.
[00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:39.515]  And therefore, there's less and less trust then in the system.
[00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:45.443]  Putting in place the mechanisms, whether they're cohort studies or whether they're Sentinel surveillance sites.
[00:00:46.192 --> 00:01:00.826]  To be able to monitor what's going on and report back and then for corrective action to be taken because unexpected things could arise after introduction and one always has to be prepared as we've seen in the history of many drugs.
[00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:07.947]  You've learned about adverse events only after the drug's been licensed and introduced into the population.
[00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:19.630]  So I think that risk is always there and the population needs to understand that and feel confident that mechanisms are being put in place to study some of those things.
[00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.051]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:35.658]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, broadcasting worldwide on this January 10th, 2020, worldwide transmission.
[00:01:36.178 --> 00:01:37.700]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.045]  We're going to lay out the scientific technocrats, who they are, and how they're trying to artificially take control of human evolution.
[00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:45.106]  That's their term.
[00:01:46.516 --> 00:02:00.161]  Back in 2019, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, told Congress, while I was in the committee room, that they've never gamed or rigged any search result in the history of Google.
[00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:06.143]  That's like saying the sun has never set or never risen over the planet Earth.
[00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:12.545]  It was a spectacular, bald-faced lie, an exercise in complete deception.
[00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:15.006]  And now here we are, a year later,
[00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:20.690]  And the number one podcast of 2019 was my appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.873]  In fact, it's the number one long-form podcast in YouTube history.
[00:02:26.714 --> 00:02:32.938]  And as soon as all these news articles were written about it being the number one podcast, what did Google do?
[00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:39.242]  They delisted it out of the Joe Rogan directory of most viewed.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.066]  Imagine if somebody won a race car race and they just said, well, we're going to take them out of the pole position.
[00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:47.928]  We're going to take them out of the checkered flag.
[00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:49.890]  We're going to say that they never won.
[00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:56.778]  That's beyond what the Soviets would do when they would kill somebody who was in the Soviet government of
[00:02:58.212 --> 00:02:58.432]  I think?
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:29.512]  Google, who is responsible now for over 90% of all internet queries for searches, can completely distort reality and manipulate minds.
[00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:50.274]  And when you look at what Google and its subdivision, YouTube, are doing, is they're particularly suppressing any information about Epstein, and the Clintons, and the sex trafficking, and DynCorp, and all of that information that's now coming out in the mainstream that we covered years ago.
[00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:58.505]  And so it is a badge of honor to be censored by these individuals, but the arrogance of corporate America to work in unison.
[00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:00.446]  It's not just Google doing it.
[00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:03.188]  Apple, when we had the number one news app two years ago, banned us.
[00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:04.608]  Number one in news.
[00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:06.950]  And they said, oh, it's curation.
[00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.171]  The public can't have this information.
[00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:14.239]  And again, that's exactly what Professor Robert Epstein has exposed.
[00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:20.200]  And we're seeing the 2020 election be stolen, be gamed right in front of us.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.761]  And it's one of Trump's greatest failures in not taking action.
[00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:30.082]  And so if Joe Rogan doesn't respond to this, if the internet doesn't get upset about this, it's another test that we fail.
[00:04:30.882 --> 00:04:34.063]  And they won't just be delisting and shadow banning interviews.
[00:04:34.643 --> 00:04:38.984]  They'll be completely taking them down because they're popular.
[00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:41.485]  Because the people resonate with them.
[00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:43.726]  Because they're awakening humanity.
[00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:47.768]  Not because they're lies or fake news.
[00:04:48.428 --> 00:04:54.691]  And now we see comedians roasting Hollywood, the Golden Globes, and telling them, you're a bunch of perverts and pedophiles.
[00:04:55.031 --> 00:05:00.834]  And the comedians saying that gets more views than the entire Golden Globes alone on YouTube.
[00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:03.035]  And so the establishment knows the truth.
[00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:05.658]  And challenging the establishment is popular.
[00:05:05.698 --> 00:05:07.959]  That's why they're working so hard to suppress it.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.681]  But that's why we've built Band.Video.
[00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:12.942]  That's why we've built Newshorse.com.
[00:05:12.962 --> 00:05:23.227]  That's why we've supported other sites out there that are telling the truth so that we have our own independent systems to challenge the censorship and the authoritarianism and the establishment narrative.
[00:05:23.968 --> 00:05:30.812]  But at the same time, they're working around the clock to actually shut us down and not even let us have access to the internet, not even let us have servers.
[00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:39.679]  Because obviously that's going to be the next level of the tyranny, is physically removing our existence off even the darker corners or more hidden areas of the internet.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:51.329]  I know that Joe was under tremendous pressure not to have me on after my first podcast visit was one of the biggest he ever did, where we exposed in 2017 Jeffrey Epstein and Pedophile Rings.
[00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.572]  So Joe had a lot of courage in 2019 to have me on.
[00:05:56.564 --> 00:06:00.629]  But now more than ever, whether he likes it or not, he's been drafted into this conflict.
[00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:10.721]  And if he chooses to take that commission and stand up as an officer for liberty and freedom and be a modern Paul Revere, Joe Rogan could change the world more than he's even done already.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.203]  A Fox News alert on the Jeffrey Epstein case.
[00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:22.370]  Accusers speaking out to ABC News in emotional accounts of the abuse they say they faced at his hands.
[00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:29.918]  As we're learning that surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's first suicide attempt has gone missing.
[00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:32.320]  Brian Yannis has the latest details.
[00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:32.641]  Brian.
[00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:33.802]  Melissa, the U.S.
[00:06:33.842 --> 00:06:48.953]  Attorney for the Southern District of New York submitted a letter to court revealing that surveillance video from outside Jeffrey Epstein's jail cell on the night of his first alleged suicide attempt in July has been deleted because of clerical and quote
[00:06:49.113 --> 00:06:49.934]  We're good to go.
[00:07:05.305 --> 00:07:19.942]  Epstein's cellmate Nicholas Tartaglione, on trial for a quadruple murder, requested the surveillance video in court to prove that he did not beat up Epstein on July 23rd and that Epstein's injuries were instead the result of his first suicide attempt.
[00:07:20.342 --> 00:07:21.623]  As prosecutors believe.
[00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:32.766]  The problem is, when the government requested a copy of the video to be saved, the MCC saved and recorded video from the wrong jail cell and video from the correct cell was deleted.
[00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:48.332]  Meantime, as the FBI continues its investigation into Epstein's former girlfriend and alleged madam Ghislaine Maxwell, last night on ABC, Epstein accuser Maria Farmer said Maxwell threatened her life after she and Epstein sexually assaulted her.
[00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:51.190]  I remember having some bruises.
[00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.410]  They didn't get my clothes off.
[00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:53.791]  They cried.
[00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:59.053]  I was in an absolute panic, to the point where I was able to get myself up and get out of that room.
[00:07:59.553 --> 00:08:05.495]  And Ghislaine came after me, but I literally took these big pieces of furniture and I pushed them against the doors.
[00:08:06.336 --> 00:08:09.057]  Melissa, Maxwell's whereabouts are still unknown.
[00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:20.152]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is January 10th, 2020 on this live Friday edition.
[00:08:20.672 --> 00:08:23.953]  We have several special guests joining us today.
[00:08:23.973 --> 00:08:27.174]  One in studio, I'll just leave it at that and surprise you.
[00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:34.736]  And we're going to also open the phones up a little bit later and take some phone calls.
[00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:51.040]  And we're going to cover the waterfront of news, but I was sitting here this morning, about three hours ago, and I was looking over the news and I was thinking to myself, what's the most important thing to cover?
[00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:54.902]  What's the most important thing with what's happening in the world?
[00:08:55.162 --> 00:08:57.262]  And it really just goes back to this.
[00:08:57.863 --> 00:09:04.025]  Are we building a pro-human future or a anti-human future?
[00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:08.722]  Future that's inhospitable to the human race.
[00:09:09.022 --> 00:09:32.550]  And the answer is, and no one can deny this, that the entire corporate media, the entire Hollywood combine, the Communist Chinese, the EU, are all promoting a post-human world, and that the family is bad, that there is no God, but that gods are coming, and they're gonna be AI gods, and they're gonna replace us.
[00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:34.231]  Whether it's
[00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:46.549]  The different physicists they put on TV, like Tyson or others, they say the same thing over and over again.
[00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:47.449]  We're obsolete.
[00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:48.150]  We're dead.
[00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.051]  We're gone.
[00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:53.574]  We should all just give up and take some high-powered prescription drugs and just fade out.
[00:09:54.898 --> 00:09:56.780]  And a lot of people nihilistically are deciding to do that.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:06.530]  You're seeing record suicide, not just here, but across the world, because we're being told humans suck, we're bad, the world without humans is going to be a great thing, that's what young people are being taught, record suicide there.
[00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:11.155]  It's the prosperity that's killing us.
[00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:17.382]  Victor Hugo said, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:21.510]  And we really are becoming monsters, aren't we?
[00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:26.434]  Slovenly, weak, stupid, no attention spans, myself included.
[00:10:27.435 --> 00:10:35.980]  Because we're not involved in the animating contest of liberty, we're not pushing ourselves, we're drowned in all this buzz of information, most of it false.
[00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:48.369]  But here on this broadcast, when I'm focused, and I'm really putting my nose to the grindstone, there is no better analysis
[00:10:49.761 --> 00:10:54.342]  of what's really happening on this planet and what the different countervailing forces are.
[00:10:54.722 --> 00:10:55.042]  Nowhere!
[00:10:55.963 --> 00:11:08.526]  And that's why I really have decided to do more focused special reports where I put on my complete A-game like we did a few weeks ago with the Jeffrey Epstein special that was an hour long.
[00:11:10.154 --> 00:11:15.455]  And so I'm committing to you in this new year, and you've already seen it, that I'm going to do even more live shows.
[00:11:15.955 --> 00:11:17.815]  I'm going to do more special broadcast.
[00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:19.976]  I'm going to do more special reports.
[00:11:20.836 --> 00:11:24.877]  But I basically shot that special report like it was live, taped to air.
[00:11:24.937 --> 00:11:26.457]  We lined up all the elements of it.
[00:11:27.257 --> 00:11:28.317]  Took us about a week.
[00:11:28.817 --> 00:11:36.719]  Then it took us four hours to set it all up, up here at 6, 7 at night, and to shoot the thing at like 8 at night.
[00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:44.512]  And then to stay up all night putting it together with documents and evidence and putting it out the next day on Christmas Eve.
[00:11:46.893 --> 00:11:56.436]  The labor and the focus of doing that and everybody coming together was incredibly satisfying.
[00:11:56.516 --> 00:12:04.018]  Way better than climbing a mountain, which I've not rock climbed a mountain, but you know I've climbed a 15,000 foot mountain from top to bottom.
[00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.556]  Better satisfaction than sex?
[00:12:08.877 --> 00:12:15.601]  Better satisfaction than seeing one of my children when they're six months old smiling at me.
[00:12:16.441 --> 00:12:29.769]  Because it's the satisfaction of building a better world for everybody, including my children, and it's the satisfaction of when you execute something right, and it's strong, and it's credible, and it's true, and it's powerful.
[00:12:34.232 --> 00:12:53.823]  And so I just want to talk today towards the end of this hour, or maybe at the start of the next, about what hit me last night and what hit me this morning and what I dreamed about all last night was the technocracy.
[00:12:55.023 --> 00:13:01.807]  And I woke up at about four in the morning with just a heavy weight of sorrow and dread.
[00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:12.304]  From the dreams I was having that were very scientific laid out projections of the future and what's going to happen to humanity.
[00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:18.229]  It's not seeing the future, it's being able to see the elements building and what that future is going to look like.
[00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:32.919]  And then my brain wargaming it through from its inception to its construction to its implementation and then mass scale analysis and then right down to the individual scale watching
[00:13:34.051 --> 00:13:39.573]  The disintegration of humanity carried out in a very planned, orderly fashion.
[00:13:40.533 --> 00:13:58.639]  And so I want to give a gestalt today, in a few segments time, both coming up in a few segments and in a few segments encapsulating it, to really warn people.
[00:13:59.482 --> 00:14:00.702]  Because this isn't my opinion.
[00:14:00.742 --> 00:14:01.942]  This is what they're building.
[00:14:02.343 --> 00:14:03.083]  This is who they are.
[00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:08.024]  Because I don't just look at what they're building and what they've built so far or how they operate in different situations.
[00:14:08.044 --> 00:14:21.646]  I look at what they all say and how they're externalizing the method of writings 50, 60 years ago with this plan into writings that were public but not put out publicly.
[00:14:21.926 --> 00:14:25.687]  They were available publicly but not popularly distributed for proletariat consumption.
[00:14:29.755 --> 00:14:35.756]  That are beyond nightmarish, and now to be here 20 years later, and we're exactly where they said they would have us.
[00:14:36.556 --> 00:14:44.218]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're marching into our graves, just like concentration camp victims in those black and white films the Nazis shot themselves of running.
[00:14:44.678 --> 00:14:51.480]  Women, children, men, strip their clothes off, put them in piles, run into those pits, and they blow their heads off.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:57.081]  But we're in slow motion running into that pit, and I can tell you, I'm not going to be part of it.
[00:14:58.055 --> 00:15:00.717]  And I'm not just going to go kicking and screaming.
[00:15:01.937 --> 00:15:07.080]  We're going to put the globalists and their satanic plan in that pit and we're going to bury it.
[00:15:07.681 --> 00:15:09.362]  They are not going to pull this thing off.
[00:15:09.402 --> 00:15:10.502]  We cannot let them.
[00:15:11.003 --> 00:15:12.223]  But that's why they're banning us.
[00:15:12.263 --> 00:15:13.484]  That's why they're attacking us everywhere.
[00:15:13.784 --> 00:15:18.227]  Because the people working for the system have sold out to this thing and it's pure evil from the pit of hell.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.620]  We are back live.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.742]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday transmission.
[00:15:25.762 --> 00:15:28.863]  I want to thank all the listeners for their support or we would not be here.
[00:15:28.883 --> 00:15:34.464]  All right, let me break down the news I'm going to be covering here today.
[00:15:35.425 --> 00:15:40.366]  We have Norm Pattis, who's a very famous criminal lawyer and First Amendment lawyer.
[00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:44.528]  And he's going to be in studio with us coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:15:44.548 --> 00:15:48.989]  Then we have a lady who's an award-winning journalist who's been a political prisoner.
[00:15:50.498 --> 00:15:56.202]  Cynthia Farhat, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, and she has been on about a year or so.
[00:15:56.262 --> 00:15:59.064]  She was all in the middle of the Arab Spring, got arrested over in Egypt.
[00:15:59.444 --> 00:16:05.588]  She can break down what the Muslim Brotherhood's up to, what's really happened with Iran from a very powerful perspective.
[00:16:05.628 --> 00:16:11.652]  She's an amazing lady, and she's going to be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:16:12.153 --> 00:16:19.118]  And Dr. Nick Begich is going to be hosting the fourth hour before the war room with the one, the only, wild man, Cuxlayer Owen.
[00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:20.892]  Troyer.
[00:16:22.934 --> 00:16:24.776]  And yes, wild horses can't drag me away.
[00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:26.817]  I'm going to be up here doing special reports this weekend.
[00:16:26.877 --> 00:16:29.119]  I'm going to be in studio doing the Sunday show.
[00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:30.580]  I landed it last Sunday.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.443]  That'll be 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:16:33.643 --> 00:16:34.424]  Central Time.
[00:16:35.124 --> 00:16:36.625]  So be sure and join us for that.
[00:16:38.267 --> 00:16:40.008]  Because every day we're on air is a miracle.
[00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:44.252]  Believe me, you don't know about 10% of what's going on.
[00:16:44.272 --> 00:16:45.493]  And I don't say that as a victim.
[00:16:46.258 --> 00:16:50.080]  I say that because we're very, very proud of how much we pissed off the New World Order.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.482]  You know, we had a caller call into the show yesterday and talk about a Netflix show.
[00:16:58.223 --> 00:17:04.906]  A popular Netflix show that they're having a debate and argument at one point.
[00:17:05.866 --> 00:17:08.948]  And the guy says something and the other person says, ooh, that's from Alex Jones.
[00:17:09.268 --> 00:17:10.748]  Everybody looks at him and goes, ah-ha!
[00:17:11.008 --> 00:17:11.509]  You're an idiot!
[00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:12.109]  He looks down.
[00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:23.339]  And I was gonna do a report on it, and I even ended up, somebody sent me the clip, but I got busy, but there's just too many of these shows and too many of these things to even keep track of it.
[00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:27.880]  They're trying to make my name, like the CIA did in 1963, conspiracy theory.
[00:17:28.661 --> 00:17:40.325]  They came up with a term, it was declassified in the late 70s, and they ordered the media that if somebody questioned the JFK assassination, that you would use the term conspiracy theory and say, oh, they're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:17:40.785 --> 00:17:42.426]  That word doesn't work anymore.
[00:17:43.777 --> 00:17:56.644]  So they're making Alex Jones, they're making Alex Jones the new word conspiracy.
[00:17:57.044 --> 00:18:00.086]  So it's a hit show called You on Netflix.
[00:18:01.407 --> 00:18:05.289]  And again, I've got the clip, didn't even think about it, but I want to talk about it now.
[00:18:06.509 --> 00:18:07.250]  Don't have it in the computer.
[00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.470]  Maybe you guys can grab it, do have it.
[00:18:11.314 --> 00:18:12.735]  A caller called in and told us how.
[00:18:12.795 --> 00:18:15.836]  They just insert, oh, you're having a debate, you're having an argument?
[00:18:16.316 --> 00:18:16.816]  Well, guess what?
[00:18:16.836 --> 00:18:18.077]  You got it from Alex Jones.
[00:18:18.117 --> 00:18:19.677]  And that's like, whoop, it's over.
[00:18:20.278 --> 00:18:22.859]  Person that gets called Alex Jones is an idiot.
[00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:25.720]  And everybody has to laugh at him.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.302]  And it's tailored for women and kind of the younger pop generation.
[00:18:31.042 --> 00:18:33.203]  But I know what's happening with the younger generation.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.965]  Even millennials are waking up, but particularly Generation Z, and they all see right through this.
[00:18:40.005 --> 00:18:45.649]  And I asked the caller, I said, so you were watching this with your wife?
[00:18:45.949 --> 00:18:46.510]  He just said that.
[00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:46.930]  I go, yeah.
[00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.372]  I said, did that make her like me more or less?
[00:18:49.392 --> 00:18:53.596]  And he goes, no, she actually said, yeah, this is insane.
[00:18:53.616 --> 00:18:55.497]  Wow, what is this guy saying?
[00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:56.178]  I better tune in.
[00:18:57.216 --> 00:19:00.797]  It didn't make her look at her boyfriend and think he was an idiot because he likes Alex Jones.
[00:19:01.217 --> 00:19:02.998]  She's like, whoa, who is this dude?
[00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.858]  But see, that's what they do.
[00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:07.699]  And they just ridicule and they attack.
[00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:08.340]  And here's the thing.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.661]  Why are they doing it if it's not working like it used to?
[00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:15.462]  Because it's all they've got and it used to work in the past.
[00:19:17.162 --> 00:19:17.963]  So I'm going to say it again.
[00:19:17.983 --> 00:19:22.210]  I don't want to make my show the center of attention about Alex Jones.
[00:19:22.751 --> 00:19:29.602]  But it's about the guests and the callers and the news and the crew and the reports and everything we do here.
[00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:31.506]  I'm just
[00:19:34.056 --> 00:19:44.164]  The curator, if you like to use a term that Tim Cook of Apple likes to use about me, but he meant it like a museum curator decides what's in the museum and what's not in the museum.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:48.387]  But when it comes to curation, I don't even have curation going on.
[00:19:48.547 --> 00:19:49.888]  I open the wide open phones.
[00:19:50.108 --> 00:19:51.509]  I read your emails.
[00:19:51.769 --> 00:19:56.213]  I cover what you're actually saying because I value that.
[00:19:57.688 --> 00:19:59.509]  I want to know what the grassroots thinks.
[00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.732]  That's where the real understanding and innovation and change comes from.
[00:20:03.752 --> 00:20:06.114]  And that's where the solutions come from.
[00:20:08.075 --> 00:20:26.989]  And that's why they're trying to cut us off from each other and atomize us and isolate us and make us dependent on them and make it where if you don't talk like they want you to and don't behave like they want you to and don't take the chemicals they want you to take and don't take the vaccines they want you to take and don't let them run your life and your body, they're going to cut you off from culture
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.103]  From business, from money, from travel, from life, from reproducing.
[00:20:35.205 --> 00:20:38.047]  Well, that's a group that's got to be met with resistance.
[00:20:39.168 --> 00:20:51.858]  We've got to fight as hard as we can now while we still have some communities that are able to communicate on the Internet before they incrementally close the door, which is happening right now.
[00:20:52.278 --> 00:20:58.323]  And Trump, I have to say, has been presiding over America losing control of the Internet,
[00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:00.846]  And lose the control of our freedoms.
[00:21:03.068 --> 00:21:24.447]  And the little bitty things he's done, like in the new trade negotiation to say the EU and others can't shut down our tech companies and don't have monopoly control over them, doesn't mean anything if Trump lets then the big tech companies operate above the Bill of Rights and Constitution and the political system and the American people.
[00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:31.275]  We've seen a few good things from Trump, but on a scale of 1 to 10, I mean, I'll give Trump a 1.
[00:21:33.497 --> 00:21:35.979]  And we need a 10 out of him on First Amendment and free speech.
[00:21:36.179 --> 00:21:37.040]  This is racketeering.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.982]  This isn't private company can do whatever it wants.
[00:21:39.142 --> 00:21:50.212]  This is private companies in real time with AI and real time censorship with people watching what the AI flags and controlling what we can say and do online.
[00:21:53.131 --> 00:21:55.993]  There's a report up on Infowars.com.
[00:21:57.955 --> 00:22:01.758]  Google caught Shadowbanning Joe Rogan's number one podcast.
[00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:05.061]  And there's a video report I filed last night with Rob Dew.
[00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:06.162]  We stayed up here late to get it done.
[00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:24.073]  It shows screenshots of Joe Rogan's YouTube page, and how I was number one on it, and then if you check for long-form podcast, number one on YouTube, and if you check on iTunes, number one there.
[00:22:24.973 --> 00:22:30.535]  It systematically, and that's the other angle, I went and looked last night, it was systematically taken out of iTunes too.
[00:22:31.655 --> 00:22:33.996]  It's still there, you just can't find it.
[00:22:35.756 --> 00:22:38.357]  Now, think about the magnitude of that.
[00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:42.018]  They're like, well, Alex Jones went on Joe Rogan's show last February,
[00:22:43.618 --> 00:22:45.841]  And he was the number one podcast of all time.
[00:22:48.624 --> 00:22:56.993]  And we can't have that at the top, just like we just so happened to launch a news app on Apple and Google two months before we got banned two years ago.
[00:22:57.533 --> 00:23:02.319]  And it was already in the top 100 news apps in two months.
[00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:04.601]  It went to number one!
[00:23:05.424 --> 00:23:13.106]  Not just in trending, number one above the New York Times, above CNN, above ABC News, and they can't have that.
[00:23:14.086 --> 00:23:25.030]  Because the knowledge of the crowd, the knowledge of we the people, says we're curating things with our choices, and we pushed Alex Jones to the top, because that's what we agree with.
[00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.690]  That's who we are.
[00:23:28.431 --> 00:23:29.851]  And they said, no you're not.
[00:23:32.403 --> 00:23:35.524]  We're going to force feed you this garbage.
[00:23:35.584 --> 00:23:38.085]  But now, everywhere they go, people are in their face.
[00:23:38.405 --> 00:23:42.767]  Whether it's the tech heads, or whether it's the Hollywood trash, everyone is rejecting them.
[00:23:42.987 --> 00:23:47.129]  And censoring me and everybody else isn't going to save you, you stinking globalist filth!
[00:23:48.513 --> 00:23:52.976]  Remember that footage of my phone being remotely controlled and hacked?
[00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:55.518]  Well, let's take a closer look.
[00:23:55.978 --> 00:24:06.226]  But this time, let's actually see what the conversation was, who it was with, to see what the hacker seems to be so interested in.
[00:24:07.006 --> 00:24:13.131]  What would anyone care about what Tori and I are communicating about in private conversations?
[00:24:13.751 --> 00:24:16.614]  To go so far as to hack my phone?
[00:24:17.134 --> 00:24:19.376]  Why did they come to me now, three years later?
[00:24:19.396 --> 00:24:22.058]  I think I was pretty vocal.
[00:24:22.078 --> 00:24:26.361]  I heard the audio the day Seth Rich died.
[00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:27.762]  I repeat, I heard it.
[00:24:28.283 --> 00:24:29.444]  Why you come to me now?
[00:24:30.342 --> 00:24:31.703]  Three years later, why?
[00:24:31.983 --> 00:24:33.943]  Oh, it's because of the election fraud.
[00:24:34.283 --> 00:24:39.145]  It's because I told the world what you didn't want them to know.
[00:24:40.286 --> 00:24:41.486]  Oh, that.
[00:24:42.306 --> 00:24:50.930]  Well, that certainly explains why Tory received a subpoena in regards to a certain murdered DNC staffer.
[00:24:55.772 --> 00:24:59.493]  The DNC server debacle was never about... Alright, folks, let's stop right there.
[00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:27.060]  I wanted to just play a minute or two of Millie Weaver's report because our reporters are doing such an incredible job and they're breaking such important information and so many times on the live broadcast we don't air it because it's a 20 minute report.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.120]  It's incredible.
[00:25:30.253 --> 00:25:31.393]  I mean it's national news.
[00:25:32.794 --> 00:25:41.016]  Phones getting hacked and then subpoenas and they want to know about Seth Rich because of what the fraud investigator was able to find.
[00:25:42.036 --> 00:25:47.137]  And how it ties into the DNC controlling computers across the country with software during elections.
[00:25:48.097 --> 00:25:54.379]  I can tell you the White House is aware and is in contact at high levels with Milley and the investigator.
[00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:58.500]  So that's just one little thing we're doing thanks to your support.
[00:25:59.983 --> 00:26:03.688]  And she is Millennium Millie.
[00:26:04.228 --> 00:26:08.633]  She's been out there as an InfoWars reporter for eight years as a contractor.
[00:26:09.635 --> 00:26:14.060]  And we like to keep it that way, too, with all the de-platforming, because she's always been legitimately on her own.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.523]  And she's just doing so much good work.
[00:26:16.543 --> 00:26:17.925]  But how long until they de-platform her?
[00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:22.317]  Or Caitlyn Bennett, because these ladies are doing an incredible job.
[00:26:22.357 --> 00:26:23.797]  And again, we're financing Caitlyn Bennett.
[00:26:24.098 --> 00:26:25.698]  And we're not bragging about that.
[00:26:26.258 --> 00:26:28.479]  I'm reporting to you what we're doing.
[00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:45.484]  And I could sit here all day and play you clips of what our reporters are doing, exposing the insanity of the left, exposing their corruption, exposing their hunger for our children to destroy their innocence, exposing them trying to take our guns, destroy our borders, bankrupt our country.
[00:26:46.491 --> 00:26:51.533]  And these are viral reports that all of our reporters are putting out and getting out.
[00:26:52.293 --> 00:26:55.014]  And it's all because of this mothership, InfoWars.
[00:26:55.414 --> 00:26:59.116]  I got a lot of other big breaking news I want to hit, but I want to just talk about what's happening on the ground.
[00:26:59.456 --> 00:27:03.417]  Let's go to this report from two days ago with our great reporter, Savannah Hernandez.
[00:27:03.437 --> 00:27:08.699]  Let's just play the shorter boil down, not the longer clip.
[00:27:08.719 --> 00:27:15.442]  But this is Democrat socialists, that's how they describe themselves, silence free speech during anti-war rally in Austin.
[00:27:17.295 --> 00:27:21.318]  This went out live a few nights ago, and then it was on Owen's War Room the day after.
[00:27:21.378 --> 00:27:27.482]  But this is the type of stuff we never get to, where she's getting assaulted, she's getting attacked just a few weeks ago.
[00:27:28.203 --> 00:27:36.389]  In this case, these people follow her around for hours, even though she has an Action 7 mic flag, so they don't physically attack her if she's in full wars.
[00:27:39.411 --> 00:27:45.655]  And then when she tries to talk to them, they just stare at her and laugh, and it's men
[00:27:48.052 --> 00:27:54.975]  She had two men come over and threatened to attack her just a few weeks ago.
[00:27:54.995 --> 00:28:01.838]  The woman attacker had attacked her female camera person so bad, they said, yes, we want security.
[00:28:01.878 --> 00:28:04.499]  And now they have security, armed security with them when they go out.
[00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:08.281]  Now, again, we had armed security with Owen across the line at that same demonstration.
[00:28:08.301 --> 00:28:10.101]  People say, where are your people with security?
[00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:12.643]  We had four security people with Owen and Savannah.
[00:28:15.322 --> 00:28:21.686]  Savannah decided to go across into the leftist to interview them, and she didn't incite them anything with an Action 7 mic flag.
[00:28:25.069 --> 00:28:33.255]  And they still didn't like her, didn't like her questions, and physically assaulted her and hurt her female reporter, Gabby.
[00:28:33.275 --> 00:28:34.055]  Her shoulder was hurt.
[00:28:34.916 --> 00:28:36.517]  That's how vicious these people are.
[00:28:39.002 --> 00:28:40.423]  And that's what America's turned into.
[00:28:40.463 --> 00:28:42.784]  And imagine if these people get full control of what they'll do to us.
[00:28:43.024 --> 00:28:45.906]  They'll turn all of America into what they've done in colleges.
[00:28:46.086 --> 00:28:49.988]  Anti-free speech, police state zones, ruled by these demons.
[00:28:50.008 --> 00:28:57.032]  So here's a few minutes of Savannah Hernandez, just a few nights ago in Austin, Texas, during an anti-Trump rally.
[00:28:57.052 --> 00:28:58.373]  It wasn't really an anti-war rally.
[00:28:58.413 --> 00:28:58.713]  Here it is.
[00:29:00.646 --> 00:29:02.748]  Can I ask you why you're attending today's rally, ma'am?
[00:29:02.928 --> 00:29:06.350]  Do you all want to speak with me today?
[00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.951]  I'm asking about Rose McGowan's tweet.
[00:29:08.392 --> 00:29:08.592]  No?
[00:29:08.772 --> 00:29:09.192]  Not at all?
[00:29:09.633 --> 00:29:10.613]  Okay.
[00:29:10.653 --> 00:29:11.394]  That's no problem.
[00:29:11.934 --> 00:29:12.735]  Ask me that.
[00:29:12.855 --> 00:29:13.936]  You're asking what question?
[00:29:14.356 --> 00:29:16.438]  I'm asking what people think about this.
[00:29:16.878 --> 00:29:18.319]  This tweet, Rose McGowan.
[00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:20.360]  So, I'm with Action 7.
[00:29:21.321 --> 00:29:22.702]  Thank you!
[00:29:23.222 --> 00:29:25.384]  Would you like to comment on Rose McGowan's tweet?
[00:29:25.524 --> 00:29:27.406]  Okay, well then, I'm trying to talk to these gentlemen.
[00:29:27.426 --> 00:29:27.686]  Thank you.
[00:29:28.106 --> 00:29:29.127]  But wait, pause for a minute.
[00:29:29.707 --> 00:29:31.809]  We're not hiding that we're InfoWars.
[00:29:31.889 --> 00:29:38.934]  If you have an InfoWars mic flag, they will physically, you've seen the videos, attack women, families.
[00:29:39.114 --> 00:29:39.934]  They go psychotic.
[00:29:39.974 --> 00:29:42.356]  It's like wearing a red Trump hat or even worse, okay?
[00:29:42.956 --> 00:29:47.640]  So we're just going out there with a little media arm that Savannah has called Action 7.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:48.920]  It's her real thing.
[00:29:49.041 --> 00:29:49.941]  It's something she does.
[00:29:50.482 --> 00:29:53.904]  But she does that as like a pen name so they don't attack her.
[00:29:53.924 --> 00:29:55.385]  But then they go, oh, she's InfoWars!
[00:29:55.405 --> 00:29:56.526]  Like, oh, we caught you!
[00:29:57.858 --> 00:30:07.066]  But again, this is the insanity, and then after this woman and this man follow her around, telling folks not to talk to her, then they won't talk to her and act like she's being mean to them.
[00:30:07.406 --> 00:30:07.787]  Here it is.
[00:30:07.807 --> 00:30:09.268]  That's fine.
[00:30:09.748 --> 00:30:10.529]  Okay, ma'am.
[00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.589]  No.
[00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:12.531]  This girl's forbidden for war.
[00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:14.973]  Ma'am, why does that make us less valued?
[00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.095]  She's also anti-war.
[00:30:17.135 --> 00:30:18.476]  Her father served in Vietnam.
[00:30:18.536 --> 00:30:19.137]  Did you know that?
[00:30:19.397 --> 00:30:22.039]  My grandfather served in Vietnam, and I'm anti-war as well.
[00:30:22.059 --> 00:30:23.460]  Killing communists is awesome.
[00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:25.955]  No, ma'am.
[00:30:25.975 --> 00:30:27.536]  Like, let's have a conversation about this.
[00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:28.517]  We're both anti-war.
[00:30:28.537 --> 00:30:32.260]  If you're gonna follow me around and discredit me in the media, so tell me why.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.482]  People that you're from Infowars is discrediting you?
[00:30:34.922 --> 00:30:39.906]  You're the one that's saying that people shouldn't talk to me because of who I work for, and I don't think that's fair.
[00:30:39.986 --> 00:30:40.887]  Why shouldn't they talk to me?
[00:30:41.247 --> 00:30:42.228]  I'd just like a response.
[00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.549]  Okay.
[00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.371]  So you don't want to talk to me anymore?
[00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:46.891]  No, no, no.
[00:30:47.211 --> 00:30:51.334]  You know, you people have been following me around all night long, and I just want a response from you now, ma'am.
[00:30:51.755 --> 00:30:53.016]  So this is your time to shine.
[00:30:54.262 --> 00:30:54.943]  Yeah.
[00:30:55.503 --> 00:30:57.624]  Ladies, can I ask you why the importance of today's rally?
[00:30:57.884 --> 00:30:58.444]  Pause again.
[00:30:59.005 --> 00:30:59.905]  Back it up five seconds, please.
[00:31:00.406 --> 00:31:03.027]  This is the perfect microcosm of how they get in her face.
[00:31:03.047 --> 00:31:03.888]  There's hours of this.
[00:31:04.288 --> 00:31:05.328]  There's a 20-minute report out.
[00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:07.570]  They follow her around for hours.
[00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.152]  And then when she turns it around and wants to talk to them, oh, leave me alone.
[00:31:11.172 --> 00:31:13.853]  And then guys come over like, hey, leave her alone, bully.
[00:31:13.873 --> 00:31:18.776]  It's like when the woman attacked her a few weeks ago, they called the police on her.
[00:31:23.763 --> 00:31:25.885]  People are dangerous, and they're authoritarian.
[00:31:26.085 --> 00:31:26.625]  Let's continue.
[00:31:28.066 --> 00:31:30.088]  We'll just follow them for the rest of the night.
[00:31:30.668 --> 00:31:32.009]  I mean, if people want to talk to us, they can.
[00:31:32.049 --> 00:31:33.450]  If they don't, we're walking away.
[00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:35.772]  So yeah, if you guys don't want to, I'll leave.
[00:31:35.792 --> 00:31:36.713]  So it's up to you.
[00:31:36.733 --> 00:31:39.655]  Would you like to meet them for me?
[00:31:39.695 --> 00:31:40.055]  Yeah.
[00:31:40.155 --> 00:31:41.196]  Okay, thanks guys.
[00:31:41.957 --> 00:31:44.138]  Folks, can I ask you why today's rally was important to you?
[00:31:49.122 --> 00:31:54.108]  By the way, even if they don't know who you are, they can't talk, they won't talk to you, almost all of them.
[00:31:54.208 --> 00:31:55.750]  And they're just hateful and they're weird.
[00:31:56.091 --> 00:32:01.577]  And I'm not going to play the rest of it, it gets worse there at the end, but it's, it's, uh, Savannah Hernandez has her own section at Band.Video.
[00:32:01.898 --> 00:32:06.283]  Just go there, click the left-hand link at the top, the menu rolls down, you can find the section.
[00:32:06.323 --> 00:32:07.044]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:32:07.084 --> 00:32:08.205]  But, again,
[00:32:09.642 --> 00:32:10.842]  It's because they're such followers.
[00:32:10.882 --> 00:32:12.943]  They don't just look weak or act weak.
[00:32:12.963 --> 00:32:16.564]  They could be black, they could be white, they could be Hispanic, they could be old, they could be young.
[00:32:17.064 --> 00:32:24.307]  They all look like a spider sunk metaphysical, spiritual fangs into them and sucked their essence out.
[00:32:24.327 --> 00:32:30.869]  If you're a radio listener, you're missing this, but even if you're driving down the road in an 18-wheeler, keeping America going.
[00:32:32.079 --> 00:32:34.222]  You've all seen the videos online of the Lepus Rally.
[00:32:34.302 --> 00:32:37.345]  It's like an ugly duckling seminar.
[00:32:37.746 --> 00:32:39.348]  It's like a convention of ghouls.
[00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:44.393]  You've seen a little mermaid with Ursula and down at the bottom all the souls she's captured.
[00:32:44.413 --> 00:32:46.416]  They all look shrunken and hunchbacked.
[00:32:48.306 --> 00:32:49.287]  That's how they are.
[00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:51.768]  And I'm not running down people that are old or hunchbacked.
[00:32:52.069 --> 00:32:52.929]  They can even be beautiful.
[00:32:52.949 --> 00:32:54.170]  You see their spirits shining through.
[00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.453]  I'm saying, with the left, they're an ugly group of people and they're stupid.
[00:32:58.853 --> 00:32:59.754]  And they act ugly.
[00:33:00.274 --> 00:33:01.575]  And they're anti-free speech.
[00:33:01.875 --> 00:33:05.858]  And they want to run our lives because they keep grasping for those that have a life force.
[00:33:06.458 --> 00:33:16.505]  And there's Savannah Hernandez politely wanting to get their perspective, but all they have is the power to segregate and say, we won't talk to you, and then to act like they denied her human company.
[00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:20.990]  Because statistically, they are the most alone, isolated people.
[00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.631]  They want us to share their misery.
[00:33:25.832 --> 00:33:26.732]  You can take it.
[00:33:30.214 --> 00:33:32.154]  I've really been thinking about the symbol of Infowars.
[00:33:32.194 --> 00:33:32.955]  We need a symbol.
[00:33:33.755 --> 00:33:37.936]  And I'm down to a wave or a volcano.
[00:33:37.956 --> 00:33:42.358]  I've really been thinking we should have a vote on that.
[00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:44.899]  We're going to come out with a new logo soon.
[00:33:47.941 --> 00:33:49.302]  You belong on this planet.
[00:33:51.402 --> 00:33:52.063]  You're beautiful.
[00:33:52.123 --> 00:33:52.923]  You're made by God.
[00:33:52.943 --> 00:33:53.903]  We're gonna do incredible things.
[00:33:53.923 --> 00:33:54.544]  You're not ugly.
[00:33:55.184 --> 00:33:55.764]  You're not bad.
[00:33:55.784 --> 00:34:03.667]  The only way you're ugly is if you turn yourself over to the globalists and those that are hijacking our destiny.
[00:34:04.408 --> 00:34:07.109]  And then all the beauty will be taken from your mind.
[00:34:07.469 --> 00:34:08.789]  You'll be given over to great delusion.
[00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:12.051]  And the light will disappear from your eyes.
[00:34:17.819 --> 00:34:23.363]  We are honored to be here on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:34:23.383 --> 00:34:25.504]  We're supposed to be off the air many years ago.
[00:34:26.165 --> 00:34:30.588]  They tried to set me up with violence or bombs, drugs.
[00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:32.309]  They tried to set us up with child porn.
[00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.610]  They've tried to destroy my life.
[00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:35.771]  They've tried to poison me.
[00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:37.852]  They've tried to send in sex operatives.
[00:34:37.872 --> 00:34:39.253]  They tried to pay people to lie.
[00:34:39.754 --> 00:34:46.999]  But thanks to your prayers, and I mean it, your prayers, thanks to you,
[00:34:48.197 --> 00:34:50.119]  God has protected him from wars to this point.
[00:34:51.941 --> 00:35:07.477]  Okay, when we start the next hour, I'm going to do my best to just give the general breakdown of what the globalists are building and different facets of it and how we could defeat it with our action.
[00:35:14.909 --> 00:35:23.151]  And then we have a special guest in studio and then another guest joining us as well that is an incredible journalist and a patriot for justice.
[00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:25.771]  He's been a political prisoner in the Middle East.
[00:35:28.212 --> 00:35:30.732]  But let me just hit some of the news here.
[00:35:33.133 --> 00:35:39.614]  It happens a lot in the last century and in the first 20 years of this century.
[00:35:41.098 --> 00:36:03.411]  That when you have countries that are surrounded by other populous countries, you've got a lot of passenger commercial air traffic going in and out, that there are hundreds if not thousands of missile batteries in places like Iran, and that people are going to think it's a missile or it's a bomber or it's an attack and you're going to shoot them down.
[00:36:04.332 --> 00:36:09.455]  Get the transponders off or they could have had false signals on there.
[00:36:11.383 --> 00:36:13.744]  Clearly, that airplane was shot down.
[00:36:13.804 --> 00:36:14.844]  I said that day one.
[00:36:14.864 --> 00:36:17.966]  The videos have come out, and there's videos of the missile parts on the ground.
[00:36:17.986 --> 00:36:20.527]  And they go, look, it's a Russian missile.
[00:36:20.547 --> 00:36:23.448]  Well, of course, the Russians are the second biggest seller of weapons in the world.
[00:36:24.208 --> 00:36:26.229]  Doesn't blame the Russian people or the people of the U.S.
[00:36:26.529 --> 00:36:27.229]  that invented a U.S.
[00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:27.549]  missile.
[00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:34.672]  Whoever pointed it at that aircraft and hit the red button or pulled the trigger.
[00:36:37.247 --> 00:36:40.830]  And that's footage of the missiles that were fired at the U.S.
[00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:46.375]  base in Iraq.
[00:36:47.076 --> 00:36:56.364]  There's also footage of the missile, core missile that was used there in, it appears, in Iran.
[00:36:57.765 --> 00:37:00.027]  And the Iranians are saying, oh, show your proof.
[00:37:01.004 --> 00:37:03.746]  Trudeau, show your proof, Trump, whoever.
[00:37:04.366 --> 00:37:07.968]  And I normally don't believe a word comes out of Justin Trudeau's mouth, but U.S.
[00:37:08.028 --> 00:37:11.310]  experts and many other experts believe that it was shot down by a missile.
[00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:16.113]  Now, could you have a false flag and somebody go into Iran and then fire a missile?
[00:37:17.074 --> 00:37:17.634]  Absolutely.
[00:37:17.934 --> 00:37:18.935]  The missile was not that big.
[00:37:23.171 --> 00:37:27.774]  And routine flights have been suspended out of Iraq and out of Iran because it's a war zone.
[00:37:28.215 --> 00:37:29.656]  That's why you don't fly into those places.
[00:37:29.676 --> 00:37:37.301]  And I'm sorry for the souls that were lost from all over the world that were flying out of Iran back into Ukraine.
[00:37:39.803 --> 00:37:43.666]  Ukraine airplanes shot down by mistake by Iranian anti-aircraft missile Pentagon officials believe.
[00:37:43.706 --> 00:37:44.927]  And that's what I believe day one.
[00:37:45.247 --> 00:37:47.029]  And not because I just believe what the Pentagon says.
[00:37:48.595 --> 00:37:52.136]  There have been several planes before shot down during the Iran-Iraq war.
[00:37:52.296 --> 00:37:53.977]  One by the US, one by Iran.
[00:37:54.697 --> 00:37:56.878]  I mean, this is not the first rodeo here.
[00:37:57.638 --> 00:38:03.100]  So I just, I know the listeners know this, but if a war is about to start or has started, you don't want to fly into one of those countries.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.441]  It's a war between big powers.
[00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:08.662]  Because planes are getting shot down.
[00:38:09.282 --> 00:38:10.823]  But the fact that Tehran
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.301]  We have that video we can roll.
[00:38:14.562 --> 00:38:19.387]  Iran uses bulldozers to clear debris from plane crash site while accusing U.S.
[00:38:19.427 --> 00:38:20.028]  of big lie.
[00:38:20.409 --> 00:38:23.712]  They shot it down and they're not letting foreign inspectors in to look at it.
[00:38:23.773 --> 00:38:27.217]  So, that looks pretty suspicious to me.
[00:38:28.817 --> 00:38:29.998]  The fact that that's going on.
[00:38:30.338 --> 00:38:39.262]  Just like 9-11, they wouldn't let anybody look at the wreckage, wouldn't let foreign investigators in, and there was so much evidence of bombs in Tower 7, Tower 1, and 2.
[00:38:39.322 --> 00:38:41.843]  That doesn't mean there isn't radical Islamic terror.
[00:38:41.863 --> 00:38:43.884]  It doesn't mean there wasn't something going on with Saudi Arabia.
[00:38:44.224 --> 00:38:48.106]  But obviously there was a big stand-down going on, and that's come out in Congress.
[00:38:48.746 --> 00:38:52.768]  But we can't see the wreckage because it was taken off under guard and shipped to China.
[00:38:54.429 --> 00:38:57.811]  Well, the Iranians just did it again.
[00:38:59.281 --> 00:39:02.864]  And they're again driving around with the bulldozers getting rid of it.
[00:39:03.245 --> 00:39:04.406]  So shifting gears out of that now.
[00:39:06.788 --> 00:39:14.595]  Trump says pathetic Democrats would have leaked Soleimani strike plans to the fake news.
[00:39:14.615 --> 00:39:15.937]  We're going to play that clip in a moment.
[00:39:17.699 --> 00:39:20.701]  Again, the video shows Ukrainian passenger plane being hit by a missile.
[00:39:20.721 --> 00:39:21.541]  We just showed that.
[00:39:22.161 --> 00:39:24.683]  Pathological, psychological warfare.
[00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:31.826]  Iran declares Canada and others to show intelligence they use to accuse Iran of downing Ukrainian jet.
[00:39:31.906 --> 00:39:39.290]  Well, I mean, witnesses said they saw a missile fired up and then the plane blew up in air and then crashed on fire before it hit the ground.
[00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:44.019]  So that would generally mean not having a malfunction and then crashing.
[00:39:44.059 --> 00:39:47.121]  It means being blown up and then crashing because of that.
[00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:51.482]  And another clip I want to get to here in a moment is Fox News host.
[00:39:53.123 --> 00:39:54.623]  We're against a ground war with Iran.
[00:39:54.703 --> 00:39:55.424]  Trump listened.
[00:39:56.304 --> 00:40:01.506]  And of course, BuzzFeed and others are upset that it wasn't a bigger war, I guess, because they're the big warlords now.
[00:40:01.566 --> 00:40:05.548]  But Tucker Carlson does have the president's ear.
[00:40:06.288 --> 00:40:08.529]  I can tell you that from folks I know that are close to the president.
[00:40:09.512 --> 00:40:11.473]  And I mean, I am friends with Tucker Carlson.
[00:40:11.493 --> 00:40:12.193]  I'm not going to get into that.
[00:40:12.353 --> 00:40:13.234]  We do talk some.
[00:40:13.254 --> 00:40:14.274]  I don't want to get him in too much trouble.
[00:40:14.975 --> 00:40:16.916]  But Tucker really has the presidents here.
[00:40:17.576 --> 00:40:18.456]  And they talk a lot.
[00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:22.478]  And it's a really good thing that Tucker does that.
[00:40:22.518 --> 00:40:26.180]  But the left particularly wants him removed at Fox.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.681]  I don't have that from Tucker.
[00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:29.562]  I have it from people that have been at the meetings and seen it.
[00:40:30.042 --> 00:40:32.883]  That's why Tucker broadcasts mainly from Maine and stays away.
[00:40:33.203 --> 00:40:34.224]  Antifa comes to his house.
[00:40:35.373 --> 00:40:40.058]  Because he's a libertarian, he's popular, the left, that isn't completely evil?
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.220]  Liberals out there?
[00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:44.071]  Listen to Carlson.
[00:40:44.091 --> 00:40:44.892]  That's why they want him off.
[00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:46.933]  And thank God he's there.
[00:40:46.953 --> 00:40:49.354]  And so there is validity to this story.
[00:40:49.434 --> 00:40:53.556]  I can tell you that he talks to Trump and says, don't listen to the neocons.
[00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:54.437]  They're going to set you up.
[00:40:54.477 --> 00:40:55.277]  They lied before.
[00:40:55.738 --> 00:40:56.738]  Sure, Iran's corrupt.
[00:40:56.798 --> 00:40:57.939]  Sure, their leadership's bad.
[00:40:58.279 --> 00:41:00.780]  But you don't want to get suckered into this.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.761]  The people don't want it.
[00:41:02.141 --> 00:41:09.925]  And he is that little angel on Trump's shoulder when the devils, like those that are betraying him,
[00:41:13.086 --> 00:41:15.028]  Bolton and others tell him opposite.
[00:41:15.788 --> 00:41:19.231]  Okay, we're going to get to that Trump clip here in a few minutes.
[00:41:19.851 --> 00:41:20.972]  First thing I want to say is this.
[00:41:23.234 --> 00:41:26.857]  I'm about a week overdue getting rid of the big year-end mega special.
[00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:34.803]  And we held it way over and sold out of a bunch of things instead of getting to almost sell out and then sell at full price until the others come in.
[00:41:34.863 --> 00:41:35.944]  But that's your gain.
[00:41:35.984 --> 00:41:37.786]  It's great products and I'm sure it'll turn out for the best.
[00:41:37.806 --> 00:41:41.489]  I've just been so focused on news, all the war stuff and a lot of other stuff behind the scenes.
[00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:46.502]  But, we're going to have a new sale today.
[00:41:46.522 --> 00:41:50.983]  I'm just going to call it a new sale, because everything's not going to be on sale anymore, because a lot of it's sold out.
[00:41:51.243 --> 00:41:52.243]  A lot of it's about to sell out.
[00:41:52.463 --> 00:41:57.024]  But there's going to be some items that I'm going to leave up, I've decided, until they do sell out.
[00:41:57.724 --> 00:42:07.347]  And that's the new whitening toothpaste that's got the nano silver that's patented, and it's got the very highest quality above sea coral calcium to remineralize your teeth.
[00:42:07.447 --> 00:42:08.107]  It's amazing.
[00:42:09.867 --> 00:42:13.529]  I'm gonna leave that at 50% off, but only for a few more days.
[00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:17.571]  Super Silver Wound Gel is about to sell out.
[00:42:18.011 --> 00:42:21.513]  I'm gonna leave that up for a couple more days, and then we'll let it go back to full price.
[00:42:22.514 --> 00:42:24.875]  I'm gonna have to end the Colloidal Silver.
[00:42:26.243 --> 00:42:27.724]  Deal that we've got going for $9.95.
[00:42:28.805 --> 00:42:34.090]  The same stuff under another label sold for $25, usually on sale for $18 or so at Whole Foods.
[00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.811]  We normally sell for about $19 to $15.
[00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:39.915]  This is a really good deal and is almost a loss leader at that price.
[00:42:39.975 --> 00:42:42.317]  It's the highest quality big old bottle of colloidal silver.
[00:42:42.517 --> 00:42:47.101]  We private label it, call it Silver Bullet, but it's the top silver in the country.
[00:42:47.842 --> 00:42:49.063]  We private label Silver Bullet.
[00:42:49.083 --> 00:42:49.243]  That's $9.95.
[00:42:49.283 --> 00:42:49.684]  That's about to end.
[00:42:52.091 --> 00:42:52.371]  I don't
[00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:21.314]  So these are the things that are still up for sale in the end of year mega sale.
[00:43:22.275 --> 00:43:26.656]  And your funding runs this operation.
[00:43:26.676 --> 00:43:27.877]  So thank you for checking it out.
[00:43:30.078 --> 00:43:37.620]  Okay, I'm going to attempt to summon my intellect and try to break down the
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:52.805]  Establishment's attempt to construct an artificial environment for humans to not just take control of our evolution, but to end the species as it exists.
[00:43:54.386 --> 00:43:59.147]  It's beyond any science fiction movie you can imagine, beyond any science horror you could ever read.
[00:43:59.187 --> 00:43:59.968]  It's beyond H.P.
[00:43:59.988 --> 00:44:01.929]  Lovecraft's Color Out of Space.
[00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:10.232]  And I'm going to do my best breaking it down in the next two segments before Norm Pattis comes into studio with us.
[00:44:13.459 --> 00:44:15.400]  And then obviously there's all the other incredible news.
[00:44:15.661 --> 00:44:18.503]  We predicted they'd kill Epstein in jail, or they'd say he died.
[00:44:18.803 --> 00:44:24.367]  We predicted that all the cameras would be malfunctioned, and they did, in two different events.
[00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:28.890]  And we even said that they would then go, oh, maybe we found it, maybe we didn't, and then finally say it's just erased.
[00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.111]  Well, they did that last night.
[00:44:31.352 --> 00:44:33.413]  It's just, these people are very predictable.
[00:44:34.254 --> 00:44:38.337]  And it's only our childlike following what they say that's gotten us in trouble.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.781]  Most people aren't bad and corrupt.
[00:44:40.841 --> 00:44:48.006]  Most people in government aren't bad, but the corrupt people in history have periods where they get control, and then you have reigns of terror.
[00:44:48.947 --> 00:45:02.636]  Well, we can bypass all that if we just have a big awakening, and if people that work for Google and the system don't just gleefully go along with all the censorship, and believe you're part of some ruling class, and you're doing it for the betterment of society, and I'm the bad guy.
[00:45:04.357 --> 00:45:07.840]  And that everybody that opposes you are the bad guys, because that's just not true.
[00:45:09.369 --> 00:45:13.413]  You work for the bad guys if you're part of the establishment and you're aiding them in what they're doing.
[00:45:14.655 --> 00:45:20.561]  Now, I want to play this special report because it's so important to know just how serious the globalists are and how they want to start a civil war.
[00:45:20.781 --> 00:45:21.102]  Here it is.
[00:45:23.451 --> 00:45:37.037]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:45:37.177 --> 00:45:41.279]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[00:45:41.439 --> 00:45:47.061]  You've heard people say, you'll have to pry my gun from my cold, dead hips.
[00:45:47.741 --> 00:45:48.021]  Okay.
[00:45:50.677 --> 00:45:53.518]  We have introduced an assault weapons ban.
[00:45:53.578 --> 00:45:57.159]  I'm talking about a ban on assault rifles.
[00:45:57.319 --> 00:46:01.300]  If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.101]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:46:06.161 --> 00:46:12.943]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:13.363]  Enough.
[00:46:13.943 --> 00:46:14.223]  Enough.
[00:46:14.744 --> 00:46:15.044]  Enough.
[00:46:15.144 --> 00:46:17.807]  We say no more!
[00:46:18.247 --> 00:46:22.431]  I'm the guy that originally wrote the assault weapons ban that became law.
[00:46:22.451 --> 00:46:24.654]  A gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line.
[00:46:24.674 --> 00:46:25.554]  He says, I have an AR-15.
[00:46:26.437 --> 00:46:29.980]  And I will turn this in if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:30.621]  Hell yes!
[00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:31.902]  We're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[00:46:31.942 --> 00:46:38.087]  We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.
[00:46:38.127 --> 00:46:41.270]  Do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?
[00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:47.255]  I said, well, look, I mean, obviously he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.
[00:46:47.875 --> 00:46:49.557]  I'm incredibly saddened.
[00:46:49.577 --> 00:46:51.378]  It is very hard to think about this.
[00:46:56.673 --> 00:47:00.094]  I'm tired of hearing people all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers.
[00:47:00.595 --> 00:47:04.096]  In my faith, people say faith without works is dead.
[00:47:04.116 --> 00:47:05.697]  So we will find a way.
[00:47:05.737 --> 00:47:10.899]  But the reason we have a problem right now is we've let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate.
[00:47:11.339 --> 00:47:14.480]  It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:19.062]  Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street.
[00:47:19.342 --> 00:47:19.683]  Period.
[00:47:19.883 --> 00:47:22.304]  And we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements.
[00:47:22.704 --> 00:47:25.305]  Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban.
[00:47:26.181 --> 00:47:31.943]  Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which by the way would have made a huge difference.
[00:47:32.103 --> 00:47:33.503]  We can ban the weapons of war.
[00:47:33.543 --> 00:47:37.004]  It's about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities.
[00:47:37.384 --> 00:47:41.625]  Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible.
[00:47:42.006 --> 00:47:44.446]  They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.
[00:47:44.906 --> 00:47:50.588]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:47:52.944 --> 00:47:56.027]  By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period.
[00:47:56.367 --> 00:47:57.788]  They cannot be sold anymore.
[00:47:58.349 --> 00:48:02.552]  Like, if you're gonna take people's guns away, wait till you get elected, then take the guns away.
[00:48:02.612 --> 00:48:08.397]  Don't tell them ahead of time, which, by the way, that's what people like me think you're gonna do.
[00:48:09.158 --> 00:48:13.321]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:48:14.062 --> 00:48:15.503]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:48:16.864 --> 00:48:18.045]  We can look at those headlines.
[00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:25.793]  Democrats unanimously agree at the highest levels for a national gun confiscation plan.
[00:48:26.993 --> 00:48:29.555]  It's just incredible.
[00:48:29.595 --> 00:48:30.936]  It almost makes me speechless.
[00:48:32.477 --> 00:48:34.918]  And then they're openly saying pedophilia is a good thing.
[00:48:34.938 --> 00:48:41.602]  And I've got articles right here where they're trying to ban single-family homes.
[00:48:43.058 --> 00:48:44.679]  All of it is right there.
[00:48:44.699 --> 00:48:49.761]  Hey, guys, will you bring me that article in about the ban on the single homes?
[00:48:50.701 --> 00:48:52.642]  Because I wanted that yesterday, and I wanted it today.
[00:48:52.662 --> 00:49:01.326]  You know, maybe it's here, but I don't have it.
[00:49:03.967 --> 00:49:08.969]  I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while, and when I get back, I'm going to lay out
[00:49:15.054 --> 00:49:15.794]  How we can stop it.
[00:49:16.714 --> 00:49:18.535]  And that's what that comes down to.
[00:49:19.655 --> 00:49:29.497]  But I'm going to codify all this and really put it together for you and then lay it all out for you.
[00:49:31.377 --> 00:49:33.578]  Because this stuff all ties together.
[00:49:35.998 --> 00:49:37.618]  And it's all part of a larger agenda.
[00:49:37.718 --> 00:49:41.319]  And when you know what the agenda is, then we can stop it.
[00:49:43.902 --> 00:49:47.625]  Norm Pattis, constitutional lawyer, criminal lawyer, you've seen him all over the national news continually.
[00:49:47.645 --> 00:49:52.149]  He's going to be in studio with us to talk about the waterfront coming up as well.
[00:49:56.233 --> 00:50:02.978]  And then, we have another special guest joining us in the third hour.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:09.924]  Right now, I'd like to air clip one, if we may, because
[00:50:10.976 --> 00:50:19.001]  This goes to the heart of everything we're dealing with, everything we're facing as a society and as a culture.
[00:50:19.341 --> 00:50:20.942]  And then I'll get to the technocracy.
[00:50:21.342 --> 00:50:22.903]  It's not the crew's fault.
[00:50:24.984 --> 00:50:25.865]  We were coming in the break.
[00:50:25.965 --> 00:50:27.045]  I was loaded for bear.
[00:50:27.946 --> 00:50:29.347]  I don't write notes, these type of things.
[00:50:29.447 --> 00:50:32.288]  I just, I like loaded into my conscious mind.
[00:50:32.689 --> 00:50:37.091]  And then I've got a trajectory to go on or I'll get caught in little Eddie pools.
[00:50:37.171 --> 00:50:38.432]  And I see the headline about
[00:50:39.687 --> 00:50:44.150]  The National Gun Confiscation Plan up at the start of the segment, and then I need that article.
[00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.292]  It's like, there's some reason this article, I'm unable to get it.
[00:50:47.312 --> 00:50:52.475]  It was on Infowars.com yesterday, and I needed that for the presentation.
[00:50:52.876 --> 00:50:56.858]  So, I'm gonna go get it, and then I'm gonna be back as best I can.
[00:50:56.898 --> 00:51:02.602]  But, I'm not covering this Joe Rogan thing because I'm in the middle of it.
[00:51:04.468 --> 00:51:07.409]  If you understand this with Joe Rogan, then you understand it all.
[00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:10.011]  Because this is what the system is doing.
[00:51:12.032 --> 00:51:14.513]  And if they're doing it to Joe Rogan, they're going to do it to you.
[00:51:14.533 --> 00:51:15.453]  They're doing it to everybody.
[00:51:16.054 --> 00:51:21.556]  But whatever is the knowledge of the crowd, whatever the people want, is what the system is trying to block.
[00:51:21.877 --> 00:51:26.459]  Which again, at a fundamental level, shows how anti-human this entire agenda is.
[00:51:26.779 --> 00:51:28.320]  So here's the report I followed last night.
[00:51:29.229 --> 00:51:42.871]  Back in 2019, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, told Congress, while I was in the committee room, that they've never gamed or rigged any search result in the history of Google.
[00:51:43.932 --> 00:51:48.852]  That's like saying the sun has never set or never risen over the planet Earth.
[00:51:49.893 --> 00:51:55.273]  It was a spectacular, bald-faced lie, an exercise in complete deception.
[00:51:55.674 --> 00:51:57.714]  And now here we are, a year later,
[00:51:58.757 --> 00:52:03.419]  And the number one podcast of 2019 was my appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[00:52:03.479 --> 00:52:08.582]  In fact, it's the number one long-form podcast in YouTube history.
[00:52:09.442 --> 00:52:15.646]  And as soon as all these news articles were written about it being the number one podcast, what did Google do?
[00:52:16.626 --> 00:52:21.949]  They delisted it out of the Joe Rogan directory of most viewed.
[00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:28.814]  Imagine if somebody won a race car race and they just said, well, we're going to take them out of the pole position.
[00:52:28.874 --> 00:52:30.655]  We're going to take them out of the checkered flag.
[00:52:31.235 --> 00:52:32.616]  We're going to say that they never won.
[00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:39.480]  That's beyond what the Soviets would do when they would kill somebody who was in the Soviet government of
[00:52:40.862 --> 00:52:47.044]  Lenin or Stalin and they would airbrush their their photo out of subsequent publications and newspapers.
[00:52:47.624 --> 00:52:49.384]  This is being done in real time by AI.
[00:52:49.864 --> 00:53:00.227]  It's being done across the board and it's it's gaming elections like professor Robert Epstein has exposed and simply by omitting results
[00:53:01.531 --> 00:53:12.229]  Google, who is responsible now for over 90% of all internet queries for searches, can completely distort reality and manipulate minds.
[00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:33.005]  And when you look at what Google and its subdivision, YouTube, are doing, is they're particularly suppressing any information about Epstein, and the Clintons, and the sex trafficking, and DynCorp, and all of that information that's now coming out in the mainstream that we covered years ago.
[00:53:33.954 --> 00:53:41.217]  And so it is a badge of honor to be censored by these individuals, but the arrogance of corporate America to work in unison.
[00:53:41.998 --> 00:53:43.178]  It's not just Google doing it.
[00:53:43.318 --> 00:53:45.899]  Apple, when we had the number one news app two years ago, banned us.
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.340]  Number one in news.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.681]  And they said, oh, it's curation.
[00:53:49.721 --> 00:53:51.902]  The public can't have this information.
[00:53:52.668 --> 00:53:56.951]  And again, that's exactly what Professor Robert Epstein has exposed.
[00:53:56.991 --> 00:54:02.916]  And we're seeing the 2020 election be stolen, be gamed right in front of us.
[00:54:02.936 --> 00:54:06.499]  And it's one of Trump's greatest failures in not taking action.
[00:54:07.339 --> 00:54:12.804]  And so if Joe Rogan doesn't respond to this, if the internet doesn't get upset about this, it's another test that we fail.
[00:54:13.644 --> 00:54:16.807]  And they won't just be delisting and shadow banning interviews.
[00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:21.730]  They'll be completely taking them down because they're popular.
[00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:24.212]  Because the people resonate with them.
[00:54:25.033 --> 00:54:26.434]  Because they're awakening humanity.
[00:54:26.915 --> 00:54:30.458]  Not because they're lies or fake news.
[00:54:31.138 --> 00:54:37.424]  And now we see comedians roasting Hollywood, the Golden Globes, and telling them, you're a bunch of perverts and pedophiles.
[00:54:37.764 --> 00:54:43.529]  And the comedian saying that gets more views than the entire Golden Globes alone on YouTube.
[00:54:44.089 --> 00:54:45.771]  And so the establishment knows the truth.
[00:54:46.627 --> 00:54:48.388]  And challenging the establishment is popular.
[00:54:48.428 --> 00:54:50.669]  That's why they're working so hard to suppress it.
[00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:53.411]  But that's why we've built Band.Video.
[00:54:54.071 --> 00:54:55.672]  That's why we've built Newshorse.com.
[00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:58.033]  That's why we've supported other sites out there.
[00:54:58.053 --> 00:55:05.957]  They're telling the truth so that we have our own independent systems to challenge the censorship and the authoritarianism and the establishment narrative.
[00:55:06.678 --> 00:55:13.542]  But at the same time, they're working around the clock to actually shut us down and not even let us have access to the internet, not even let us have servers.
[00:55:14.542 --> 00:55:22.387]  Because obviously that's going to be the next level of the tyranny, is physically removing our existence off even the darker corners or more hidden areas of the internet.
[00:55:23.187 --> 00:55:28.711]  I know that Joe was under tremendous pressure not to have me on after my first podcast visit was one of the biggest he ever did.
[00:55:30.252 --> 00:55:34.034]  Where we exposed in 2017, Jeffrey Epstein, The Pedophile Rings.
[00:55:35.195 --> 00:55:37.176]  So Joe had a lot of courage in 2019 to have me on.
[00:55:39.278 --> 00:55:43.361]  But now more than ever, whether he likes it or not, he's been drafted into this conflict.
[00:55:43.961 --> 00:55:53.447]  And if he chooses to take that commission and stand up as an officer for liberty and freedom and be a modern Paul Revere, Joe Rogan could change the world more than he's even done already.
[00:55:54.808 --> 00:55:59.591]  But regardless of what decision Joe Rogan makes, it's up to all of us to make the right decision.
[00:56:00.591 --> 00:56:01.712]  I know I've made the right decision.
[00:56:02.252 --> 00:56:03.253]  I've bet on humanity.
[00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:18.778]  So they are delisting it off of iTunes, they're delisting it off of Google, and they usually do that shadow ban before taking it down completely.
[00:56:19.338 --> 00:56:22.099]  Because they just can't have something be number one.
[00:56:22.459 --> 00:56:26.741]  Forty-something million views if you add up the different videos together, just of that interview, just on YouTube.
[00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:32.504]  And then it's been number one in long form there on iTunes.
[00:56:34.096 --> 00:56:35.877]  And so, imagine that.
[00:56:36.757 --> 00:56:41.780]  Oh, a book's the number one seller, so we won't let you buy it or read it.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.601]  Well, that's a bookstore's choice not to sell it, right?
[00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:48.363]  But see, this is Joe Rogan.
[00:56:48.383 --> 00:56:49.723]  This is someone with a guest on.
[00:56:49.743 --> 00:56:50.884]  This is something that happened.
[00:56:51.144 --> 00:56:52.424]  This is something that was popular.
[00:56:52.444 --> 00:56:53.625]  This is something that's number one.
[00:56:54.145 --> 00:56:56.126]  And they're saying, no, no, no, you can't have that.
[00:56:56.726 --> 00:56:57.827]  That's mind control.
[00:56:57.887 --> 00:56:59.668]  That's so dangerous on so many fronts.
[00:57:00.008 --> 00:57:00.968]  Oh, build your own YouTube.
[00:57:00.988 --> 00:57:01.409]  Well, we have.
[00:57:01.429 --> 00:57:02.189]  It's called Bandai Video.
[00:57:04.312 --> 00:57:08.473]  We don't have $700 billion like Google.
[00:57:10.614 --> 00:57:12.294]  We don't even have $500,000 extra dollars.
[00:57:15.495 --> 00:57:19.496]  We don't have a trillion like Apple or slave factories in China.
[00:57:20.457 --> 00:57:27.819]  And I'm not gay and really skinny with bug eyes, so it's okay if Tim Cook owns and runs the worst slave factories on earth because he's gay!
[00:57:28.919 --> 00:57:29.960]  So, it's okay.
[00:57:33.086 --> 00:57:35.927]  You can find the band interview at Infowars.com right now.
[00:57:36.808 --> 00:57:40.149]  And if they ban it off the internet, I'll post it at band.video unless Joe tells me he doesn't want me to.
[00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:41.170]  Stay with us.
[00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:42.510]  I'm going to break down the technocracy next.
[00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:44.871]  Welcome back.
[00:57:45.992 --> 00:57:50.194]  I am your host Alex Jones on this Friday, January 10th, 2020 edition.
[00:57:51.054 --> 00:57:52.215]  The future is here.
[00:57:52.395 --> 00:57:56.076]  It's just not evenly distributed at this point.
[00:57:57.477 --> 00:57:58.097]  That's what's happened.
[00:57:59.598 --> 00:57:59.698]  And
[00:58:04.071 --> 00:58:07.593]  I really want to try to break down the technocracy.
[00:58:08.613 --> 00:58:15.376]  I really want to lay down what their endgame plan is and what we need to do to fight it, but I'm just not able to at this point.
[00:58:15.797 --> 00:58:17.898]  I just, there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and things.
[00:58:17.938 --> 00:58:18.818]  It's nobody's fault.
[00:58:18.838 --> 00:58:19.538]  I just can't do it.
[00:58:20.479 --> 00:58:33.025]  So it's, it's, it's, it's too important to, um, you know, like I said earlier, I really, and truly,
[00:58:34.485 --> 00:58:57.398]  Want to do heavily produced reports and that go into the numbers and the facts and the statements and that carve out each area of the overall program to show how it's being integrated together and then show how the technocrats, the social engineers, the mad scientists are admitting they're doing it.
[00:58:57.878 --> 00:59:03.081]  So you have to understand, it's not just I'm up here saying they're doing all this.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.821]  And then it's my opinion about why they're doing it or where it's taking us.
[00:59:09.002 --> 00:59:09.942]  It's all there.
[00:59:09.962 --> 00:59:17.505]  The geoengineering, the manipulation of the climate, the chemicals that are released on purpose to ravage life across the planet.
[00:59:19.926 --> 00:59:33.252]  And they're slowly killing the planet while they're telling you that it's going to die and that it's your fault and that humanity has to die to save the planet.
[00:59:34.417 --> 00:59:39.079]  So do you see how that logic and how that trick works?
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:41.721]  Humans are inherently bad.
[00:59:43.322 --> 00:59:44.922]  Humans are the reason the planet's dying.
[00:59:46.223 --> 00:59:51.406]  We need a global government to protect the planet.
[00:59:53.907 --> 01:00:01.051]  And then the engineers that are taking over the planet want to build a new planet where humans are extinct
[01:00:02.503 --> 01:00:07.544]  And that remnants of what were humans supposedly merged with silicon to make this new life form.
[01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:15.306]  And then they themselves are systematically trying to heat the planet up with the terraforming.
[01:00:16.266 --> 01:00:17.326]  It's not geoengineering.
[01:00:17.346 --> 01:00:21.547]  Geoengineering is when you geoengineer for what you already have and what you want and what your species wants.
[01:00:23.247 --> 01:00:30.469]  Terraforming is when you take something that's inhospitable to you and you change it to be hospitable.
[01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:35.884]  And that's what's going on.
[01:00:37.465 --> 01:00:38.806]  And we're being terraformed.
[01:00:39.526 --> 01:00:42.809]  We're being changed, and it's not for the best.
[01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:48.593]  And everything being established is being set up to be artificial.
[01:00:49.994 --> 01:00:53.297]  Now, let's just take one little piece of the technocracy, and that's the Internet.
[01:00:55.438 --> 01:01:04.085]  Developed in the 1960s as a plan to have every human monitored by central computer terminals and digital tablets that we would carry,
[01:01:06.192 --> 01:01:29.866]  That would interface with those and track our every movement and then it would also track what we do to add input to control through stimuli the mass of the population in a giant human-machine interface building the first artificially intelligent alien life form that is a symbiose
[01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:55.584]  In the paperwork of humans and the machine interface by billions of humans interfacing into the nodes in real time with their eyes and ears and thoughts and ideas and hopes and dreams and data and input through AI, through all these other systems, through these filters back out through satellites and surveillance cameras and smart dust and drones and 5G and cell towers.
[01:01:57.679 --> 01:02:07.725]  So that the AI can then absorb the human knowledge and then in the process make humans obsolete, stunted, stupid, alone.
[01:02:07.745 --> 01:02:22.494]  And then they'll be offered to quote transition out of the hell that they're creating for us into the supposed digital Eden of the new false dimension, silicon dimension they're creating.
[01:02:24.556 --> 01:02:26.497]  Taking us with them into that dimension.
[01:02:28.939 --> 01:02:32.603]  And that's the simplest way to break that down and that's what they admit it was set up for.
[01:02:33.604 --> 01:02:40.432]  You're always told it was set up to defeat the Russians in a nuclear war so there'd still be communications and no way to cut off communications.
[01:02:40.492 --> 01:02:42.334]  That is not what it was set up for.
[01:02:46.699 --> 01:02:48.562]  That's what the Pentagon was told it was being set up for.
[01:02:50.404 --> 01:02:53.546]  Just like the Pentagon's going over to Microsoft Cloud.
[01:02:53.966 --> 01:02:55.487]  Oh, we don't trust Jeff Bezos.
[01:02:56.308 --> 01:03:01.651]  He's a big liberal, which he is a leftist globalist and a tax exemptor that tells everybody else they need to have high taxes but him.
[01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:14.319]  But Bill Gates, of course, is the only one trusted to have the Pentagon's, all its secrets, all its interfaces that the Pentagon won't control but that Microsoft will and the AI will.
[01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:18.740]  Because Bill Gates's dad ran the Eugenics Cold Springs Harbor program.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.061]  He ran Planned Parenthood for the Rockefellers.
[01:03:22.542 --> 01:03:29.626]  He got IBM and the grants out of that to give Bill Gates his monopoly with Microsoft.
[01:03:30.686 --> 01:03:36.289]  That family is trusted science officers of this group.
[01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:40.912]  And I can talk for 10 hours about that alone and the eugenics and all the rest of it.
[01:03:44.537 --> 01:03:58.428]  And IBM, and Thomas Watson, and the Nazis, and the whole plan, but IBM couldn't get around it because of Monopoly, so they set up Microsoft and acted like, oh, we just gave Microsoft the software, didn't know how important that would be, and all this crap.
[01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:08.716]  And then all these mid-level hippies and programmers and people think they're building one thing for global peace and all the rest of it, and they're really building
[01:04:12.358 --> 01:04:16.639]  Something completely different.
[01:04:21.101 --> 01:04:24.702]  And at the higher levels of government, they say, oh, it's a total surveillance grid.
[01:04:24.922 --> 01:04:26.143]  It interfaces with all human activity.
[01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:27.523]  It's going to create total peace on earth.
[01:04:28.043 --> 01:04:30.124]  And we're going to know about all crime and all bad things.
[01:04:30.144 --> 01:04:31.124]  We're going to be able to fix it all.
[01:04:31.164 --> 01:04:33.345]  But you notice everything gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:04:33.805 --> 01:04:35.185]  People have to work more and more and more.
[01:04:35.225 --> 01:04:36.506]  People are dumber and more alone.
[01:04:37.944 --> 01:04:45.146]  Oh, we've got to build the giant total surveillance AI grid, because if we don't, the Chinese will, or somebody else will.
[01:04:45.426 --> 01:04:57.570]  We have to build it to be guardians of everything, like Johnny Depp and his singularity movie, Transcendence, where he becomes the AI and is a benevolent dust that enters the atmosphere.
[01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:06.313]  Well, that's the actual admitted 30-year-ago DARPA plan, to have smart dust in everything, so every grain of sand has an IP address.
[01:05:08.046 --> 01:05:22.751]  But if you don't serve the globalist, and whatever it is they want you to do to stay in the matrix, because that's what they're building, is a third dimensional matrix that swallows you up, then they'll deactivate your web address.
[01:05:23.959 --> 01:05:36.773]  And you'll be obsolete, and everyone will run from you, shunning you, and you will effectively not be able to take one step outside your front door, as the Chinese government said last year about what they're building with Google and Apple.
[01:05:37.274 --> 01:05:39.736]  And beta testing, they're already being rolled out here as well.
[01:05:42.359 --> 01:05:43.841]  Oh, let's make it about Alex Jones.
[01:05:43.861 --> 01:05:45.423]  Let's demonize him, he's warning about it.
[01:05:49.295 --> 01:05:52.337]  Then let's have people not stand up for him, and then we'll roll it out against everybody.
[01:05:52.857 --> 01:06:03.683]  And that's part one of what I'm going to be getting into and detailing and showing all the documentation about what they're doing, how they sell it to the general public, what the globalists are told it's for, and what it's really going to be.
[01:06:04.223 --> 01:06:06.825]  Because they're, all of them, deceived.
[01:06:07.725 --> 01:06:08.746]  Just like the one ring.
[01:06:09.326 --> 01:06:12.868]  Rings of power are given out, but only to enslave those that have them.
[01:06:13.409 --> 01:06:13.969]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:15.453 --> 01:06:16.753]  Fotis Doulos.
[01:06:17.013 --> 01:06:19.214]  You know, we've not talked a lot about that case.
[01:06:19.294 --> 01:06:23.475]  It's been one of the top murder cases of the last few years.
[01:06:24.055 --> 01:06:27.315]  The media sometimes just chooses what they want to make the big murder case.
[01:06:28.056 --> 01:06:34.617]  If it's thousands of people found dead in graves over the Texas border in Mexico, women and children killed by the cartels, zero coverage.
[01:06:34.677 --> 01:06:36.197]  It'll just be barely mentioned.
[01:06:36.457 --> 01:06:37.557]  I guess 1% coverage.
[01:06:38.518 --> 01:06:44.359]  But if it's a white male who they think's killed a white woman and it's
[01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:51.552]  I guess the way to demonize the idea of men and women together, I've just noticed they will hype it up.
[01:06:51.612 --> 01:06:58.236]  That's why people actually believe there's record numbers of police killing black people, even though it's very, very rare and most of the shootings are justified.
[01:06:58.276 --> 01:07:00.217]  I'm not some brown noser of the police.
[01:07:00.277 --> 01:07:05.720]  I mean, almost all those big police shooting cases you've seen, it turns out the video gets released later and the person attacked him or had a gun.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.982]  But why does the media and the Justice Department under Obama hype it?
[01:07:09.302 --> 01:07:11.143]  Because it's creating division.
[01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:12.684]  Well, guess what?
[01:07:12.784 --> 01:07:29.375]  I've got the lawyer right here, Norm Pattis, who's also my lawyer, and one of the lawyers, you never see this happening, this is pretty dangerous, not one of your lawyers, but one of your defendant's lawyers, one of your client's lawyers, has been arrested for conspiracy.
[01:07:30.396 --> 01:07:32.197]  So this is getting really, really crazy.
[01:07:32.237 --> 01:07:32.978]  I hope you don't get
[01:07:33.018 --> 01:07:35.679]  Yeah, me too.
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.260]  Well, I mean, we were shocked by that.
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:41.182]  We thought we had pretty good sources in the state police, and we did.
[01:07:42.023 --> 01:07:49.127]  But we got a call, I guess, what is it today, Friday, Tuesday morning, that there were warrants on the judge's desk, and there were three of them.
[01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:49.907]  And I'm like, three?
[01:07:49.927 --> 01:07:55.690]  You know, I wasn't surprised that Mr. Dulos was going to be arrested, or his girlfriend, Michelle Tricones.
[01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:58.432]  But the lawyer did catch me by surprise.
[01:07:58.852 --> 01:08:05.278]  Reading the warrant, Alex, I don't think there's a snowball's chance in hell that Mr. Maloney is going to be convicted.
[01:08:06.079 --> 01:08:11.664]  It struck me that they arrested him in an effort to try to turn him as a witness against Mr. Dulos.
[01:08:12.245 --> 01:08:20.453]  Well, that's my question for you, is you represent me in the Connecticut Sandy Hook situation that
[01:08:21.513 --> 01:08:22.774]  They're trying to make my identity.
[01:08:22.894 --> 01:08:33.020]  I mean, on the night of the New Year, a week ago or so, now 10 days ago, wow, every channel just had some minor court thing that blew it up.
[01:08:33.141 --> 01:08:34.882]  And again, trying to make that my identity.
[01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:36.022]  I barely even ever talked about it.
[01:08:36.283 --> 01:08:45.909]  But that's what they decided to counter Alex Jones and Infowars with, is questioning public events and things that happened, or questioning Jussie Smollett, or people questioned
[01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:50.011]  You know, whether the Iranian general was really killed at first.
[01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:52.952]  I mean, that's a normal thing to do, but they're trying to outlaw questioning things.
[01:08:52.992 --> 01:09:10.319]  But the way you've been death-threatened for representing me and others, and the way people think that people don't have rights to a defense lawyer or a criminal lawyer or a First Amendment lawyer, even if I was guilty or someone else was, which I'm not, of what they're saying I've done, people have a right to that in our system.
[01:09:10.339 --> 01:09:13.921]  But this idea now of persecuting lawyers is really frightening.
[01:09:14.591 --> 01:09:15.312]  It is and it isn't.
[01:09:15.392 --> 01:09:19.314]  I mean, the charges against Mr. Mawinney in the Dulos case are unusual.
[01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:23.197]  Getting gas for representing controversial people goes with the turf.
[01:09:24.138 --> 01:09:27.520]  So I'm not too put off by the number of threats we've received.
[01:09:27.981 --> 01:09:32.284]  In fact, it's kind of reassuring to get on email in the morning and have somebody tell me I'm a vicious piece of scum.
[01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:33.645]  Lets me know I'm doing my work.
[01:09:33.685 --> 01:09:38.328]  And as I say to people who do that all the time, I'm not going to pay the rent for the space I occupy in your head.
[01:09:38.368 --> 01:09:39.569]  Go tell it to somebody who cares.
[01:09:39.849 --> 01:09:41.070]  But don't people get that
[01:09:43.675 --> 01:09:47.076]  It's our form of government, and it goes back to English common law.
[01:09:47.136 --> 01:09:50.898]  It's over a thousand years old, and it's the best system in the world.
[01:09:50.938 --> 01:09:51.618]  It's not perfect.
[01:09:52.178 --> 01:09:58.100]  I mean, 14% of people on a national poll think that chocolate milk comes from brown cows.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:58.641]  No.
[01:09:58.981 --> 01:10:00.901]  No, no, no, that's real.
[01:10:01.141 --> 01:10:01.922]  Is that really true?
[01:10:01.962 --> 01:10:02.582]  That's true, yeah.
[01:10:02.762 --> 01:10:03.962]  Yeah, are you telling me it doesn't?
[01:10:03.982 --> 01:10:05.042]  It doesn't.
[01:10:05.203 --> 01:10:07.243]  Well, where does the strawberry milk come from then?
[01:10:07.323 --> 01:10:08.023]  Strawberry cow.
[01:10:08.383 --> 01:10:08.903]  Oh, the pink.
[01:10:09.003 --> 01:10:10.024]  I saw a pink cow.
[01:10:10.064 --> 01:10:12.244]  No wonder there are so few strawberry milk charts on the show.
[01:10:12.264 --> 01:10:13.684]  Strawberry milk comes from a mole rat.
[01:10:13.824 --> 01:10:14.464]  Oh, alright, alright.
[01:10:14.865 --> 01:10:19.385]  Strawberry milk comes from the Young Turks host's mammary glands, large udders.
[01:10:19.506 --> 01:10:20.206]  Yeah, here we go.
[01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:22.246]  Utterly ridiculous, yeah.
[01:10:23.146 --> 01:10:25.367]  No, I mean, people don't get it.
[01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:26.387]  CNN reporting on it.
[01:10:27.537 --> 01:10:36.401]  People, I don't know if people don't get it or not, I think everybody hates a lawyer until you need one, then when the lawyer is your last hope, you love your lawyer, but you hate the next guy.
[01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:38.862]  So, it goes with the turf, you know?
[01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:47.686]  So, strawberry milk is strawberry added to milk, comes from the mammaries of bovine, and you're a famous defense lawyer, and that's an honorable good thing.
[01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:49.797]  Um, I hope so.
[01:10:50.078 --> 01:10:53.599]  My wife thinks so most days, and my clients think so most days.
[01:10:53.619 --> 01:10:57.561]  Well, if we're not supposed to have defense in this country, I mean, who are we supposed to have defend us then?
[01:10:57.741 --> 01:10:59.162]  Well, we're not supposed to have a defense.
[01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:00.642]  The mob speaks, you know?
[01:11:00.682 --> 01:11:02.863]  I mean, there is no mob like a self-righteous mob.
[01:11:02.883 --> 01:11:03.904]  I've told you that before.
[01:11:04.304 --> 01:11:08.045]  And if you take a controversial stand and you get enough people who don't like you, you're in trouble.
[01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:10.947]  So, for example, in the Dulos case, how you opened the case.
[01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:13.988]  Why has this case captured the world's attention?
[01:11:14.028 --> 01:11:15.829]  It's because an upper-middle-class white woman
[01:11:16.309 --> 01:11:16.629]  I think?
[01:11:48.559 --> 01:11:51.863]  It's kind of Twilight Zone though because I'm in the center of the spotlight and so are you.
[01:11:51.903 --> 01:11:56.468]  I'll be walking through a restaurant or turn on the TV and it's you and there's like a hundred cameras.
[01:11:57.009 --> 01:11:58.290]  Yeah, that's pretty, that is Twilight Zone.
[01:11:58.310 --> 01:12:00.353]  Because this is like OJ Simpson level cameras.
[01:12:00.653 --> 01:12:02.776]  Yeah, it sort of feels that way.
[01:12:02.916 --> 01:12:04.257]  I thought the interest would die.
[01:12:04.277 --> 01:12:07.341]  No, when there's a hundred cameras outside your office that's OJ Simpson level.
[01:12:07.401 --> 01:12:11.903]  Alright, well I expected the interest level to die down, but if anything it seems to be increasing.
[01:12:12.303 --> 01:12:21.466]  This morning, friends of Jennifer announced that they were supporting new domestic violence legislation as a result of Fotis' arrest.
[01:12:21.506 --> 01:12:23.747]  And my view is that's a massive non sequitur.
[01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:24.647]  Shame on you.
[01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:25.788]  He hasn't even been tried.
[01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:26.288]  There's no suggestion.
[01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:28.349]  Well what it's saying is you're for violence against women.
[01:12:29.169 --> 01:12:30.470]  You know, if you don't give us money.
[01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:32.932]  I mean, it's piggybacking on something.
[01:12:33.453 --> 01:12:48.045]  You know, getting into Sandy Hook, not my questioning, which I have a right to do, and there are misrepresentations of what I've said, but I've seen on the news, and the word is it's bigger, that there's $100 million that's been given somehow to the families and people, and I guess there's more, more, more.
[01:12:48.385 --> 01:12:58.213]  Well, my understanding is the State's Attorney General has looked at charitable giving to Newtown and has identified about $100 million that's flowed into that town in response to the Sandy Hook shooting.
[01:12:58.753 --> 01:13:01.875]  Where it's all gone, what's been done with it is an open question.
[01:13:02.115 --> 01:13:08.779]  From my perspective, I wonder how much of it's been siphoned into the attack on you, and I intend to find out as the litigation progresses.
[01:13:08.859 --> 01:13:10.380]  Well, that's my point, Ish.
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:15.923]  Leftists come up to me like drunken parrots, and they go, Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook, and they just start screaming it at me.
[01:13:16.163 --> 01:13:22.986]  Anywhere I go, I'll shake 20 hands, and one of these people comes over like a parrot, and I just go, Jeffrey Epstein, Hillary Clinton, and then they shut up.
[01:13:24.784 --> 01:13:32.387]  They keep saying, I made my fortune, or I'm all about this thing I barely ever talked about, and then they're always using my name for more publicity.
[01:13:32.527 --> 01:13:32.747]  Yeah.
[01:13:32.847 --> 01:13:35.888]  And then saying, leave us alone, stop talking about it, stop it!
[01:13:36.108 --> 01:13:47.212]  And I'm like, sending cease and desist letters saying, please stop saying I said this, I didn't say this, and stop saying it in my name, because republishing it is so evil and so horrible, you're the ones, the lawyers and people, that are republishing it.
[01:13:47.572 --> 01:13:52.319]  Our goal is to bring you peace of mind as to these cases and to close them out as quickly as possible.
[01:13:52.499 --> 01:14:02.232]  The Connecticut Supreme Court has been sitting on the decision that we argued in your case, I think September 26th, so it's going to be 14 weeks I think this week or yesterday.
[01:14:02.913 --> 01:14:11.095]  One of these days we'll get a decision and hopefully we can get it back to the trial court and address this with substantive motions and with any luck we'll be able to end the case soon.
[01:14:11.516 --> 01:14:25.420]  Well all these leftists, I've seen them celebrating all the news every time there's some little court thing or a judge says you may have to pay attorney's fees at the end of this and the attorney's fees are over $100,000 in the last year in this Texas case and that becomes Jones fine of $100,000.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.760]  That's not what happened.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.841]  It's all disinfo, not as big as
[01:14:29.861 --> 01:14:35.647]  Market Watch and AP saying that I lost a suit for Nobody Died of Sandy Hook book that I didn't write.
[01:14:35.747 --> 01:14:36.407]  I'm not in the suit.
[01:14:36.567 --> 01:14:36.988]  No, I hear you.
[01:14:37.008 --> 01:14:39.950]  But I understand you did have some authorship in the Holy Bible.
[01:14:39.991 --> 01:14:40.751]  Am I right about that?
[01:14:41.132 --> 01:14:41.612]  No, I didn't.
[01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:42.493]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:14:42.513 --> 01:14:43.814]  Where did that rumor come from?
[01:14:44.835 --> 01:14:45.255]  Exactly.
[01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:54.785]  I'm just, I just can't believe how obsessed they are and how they just, just, just continue to bring my name up in association with it.
[01:14:54.825 --> 01:14:55.266]  It's crazy.
[01:14:55.666 --> 01:14:56.506]  You know, it is crazy.
[01:14:56.546 --> 01:15:04.191]  I've not had the prominence that you've had in the national imagination, but from time to time somebody will write a story about me and I'm like, where did that come from?
[01:15:04.311 --> 01:15:10.354]  Or, you know, if I'm on trial in a case in the newspaper, I don't read the press coverage because I used to when I was a kid.
[01:15:10.394 --> 01:15:14.677]  I'd read it just to see how I was doing and then I'd look at it and say, that's not even what happened in court yesterday.
[01:15:15.037 --> 01:15:21.759]  No, I don't doubt that reporters are doing their best to get it right, but when it comes to court reporting, the answer is they often are a mile from the truth.
[01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.979]  And the same is true of your case.
[01:15:24.659 --> 01:15:30.201]  And people know that now, so what's going to happen with this crisis of confidence in the media?
[01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.761]  Because I don't want it to be so horrible.
[01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:33.221]  I don't want them to be so deceptive.
[01:15:33.442 --> 01:15:35.322]  They've clearly gotten much, much worse.
[01:15:35.722 --> 01:15:38.183]  There's been some big developments in the Jussie Smollett case.
[01:15:38.203 --> 01:15:39.823]  We'll talk about that with Norm Patton straight ahead.
[01:15:41.924 --> 01:15:43.104]  I don't want to interrupt, then I'm leaving.
[01:15:44.443 --> 01:15:45.423]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[01:15:45.483 --> 01:15:47.684]  You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's.
[01:15:48.084 --> 01:15:51.165]  And, of course, Harris and Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[01:15:51.205 --> 01:15:52.525]  The crew's volunteered to do it.
[01:15:52.785 --> 01:15:55.846]  So, we're here live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[01:15:56.206 --> 01:15:57.426]  So, the live coverage continues.
[01:15:57.466 --> 01:15:58.527]  Everybody spread those links.
[01:15:58.807 --> 01:16:01.147]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[01:16:01.167 --> 01:16:01.768]  Don't let them win.
[01:16:01.928 --> 01:16:02.528]  No BS.
[01:16:02.888 --> 01:16:04.428]  Let me tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:06.369]  See, I don't have some Machiavelli manipulative view.
[01:16:07.089 --> 01:16:09.290]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:10.450]  That's the real power!
[01:16:11.914 --> 01:16:12.758]  Well, there you go.
[01:16:12.778 --> 01:16:14.727]  That was a fun little thing Derrick McBreen put together.
[01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:20.192]  Norm Pattis is going to ride shotgun with us in the next hour because he's a big defender of free speech.
[01:16:20.252 --> 01:16:24.055]  We have an amazing lady who is one of the top journalists in the Middle East.
[01:16:24.075 --> 01:16:25.436]  I mean, she's super famous over there.
[01:16:26.097 --> 01:16:34.803]  She was arrested during the coup that Obama and others financed over our allies in Egypt and then put the Muslim Brotherhood in charge.
[01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:37.706]  She's going to give us her take on free speech worldwide.
[01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:39.127]  I figure you might want to ride shotgun with us for that.
[01:16:39.147 --> 01:16:40.087]  I'd love to hear that, yeah.
[01:16:40.448 --> 01:16:44.731]  But before I get into the Jussie Smollett development, because it ties into the whole surveillance state.
[01:16:46.178 --> 01:16:59.540]  Just in general, you are a bookstore owner as well, and I really respect that, because that's going to become more and more precious as big tech's allowed to censor and control and kind of digitally burn information.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.721]  They can go in with an algorithm and say everything on Google that has Alex Jones' voice can be erased.
[01:17:04.341 --> 01:17:06.201]  I said that 10 years ago, because they have the technology.
[01:17:06.241 --> 01:17:07.782]  Now they're saying they're going to start doing it.
[01:17:08.262 --> 01:17:09.662]  Or they hear your voice, they block it.
[01:17:10.502 --> 01:17:11.962]  The same technology they can do for music.
[01:17:12.603 --> 01:17:15.083]  So it's a very, very dangerous future that's already here.
[01:17:17.051 --> 01:17:38.369]  Why do you think the establishment has made the decision, clearly a long time ago, they're just getting to the point now of going operational, to totally use tech to surveil and control in real time, and as Sacha Baron Cohen said, reading an ADL battle plan, they want everything we say on the internet a one-hour hold, approved by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL.
[01:17:38.549 --> 01:17:39.130]  He actually said that.
[01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:43.173]  We're there reading what you say and what you do anywhere, even in private messaging they want.
[01:17:43.473 --> 01:17:43.914]  He said that.
[01:17:44.929 --> 01:17:46.313]  Whatsapp, CNN wants to do that.
[01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:50.905]  In live time surveilling you, prior restraint, what do you call that in law?
[01:17:51.754 --> 01:17:57.255]  Well, a decision about whether speech can be published is a prior restraint.
[01:17:57.295 --> 01:17:59.936]  Now when the government does it, it's actually absolutely prohibited.
[01:18:00.336 --> 01:18:03.776]  When big tech does it, it's not prohibited yet by the First Amendment.
[01:18:03.816 --> 01:18:10.678]  So the discussion we need to have in this country is whether big tech is so large and monopolistic that it becomes quasi-governmental.
[01:18:11.218 --> 01:18:17.399]  And I'd say there's a good argument that it is because we grant them immunity from suit under the Communication Decency Act.
[01:18:17.839 --> 01:18:21.282]  So that's the argument in favor of free speech.
[01:18:21.622 --> 01:18:23.344]  You ask why big tech does it?
[01:18:23.384 --> 01:18:26.086]  Because they can, and social control is profitable.
[01:18:26.467 --> 01:18:38.257]  If they harvest all of your metadata, every click about what you visit, and they apply machine learning to that, and they recognize patterns you may not be aware of, they can predict what you're going to do and they can control you.
[01:18:38.557 --> 01:18:41.880]  And hasn't that been the dream of autocrats everywhere forever?
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.041]  That's been the holy grail.
[01:18:43.181 --> 01:18:45.243]  And now we can actually do it.
[01:18:45.723 --> 01:18:54.888]  And so, you know, we each create digital trails that yield the ability to predict what we're going to do next, and with prediction comes control.
[01:18:54.948 --> 01:18:56.569]  And, you know, I don't think many people care.
[01:18:56.589 --> 01:18:59.470]  You know, it's funny, over the... Because they say, I have nothing to hide.
[01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:03.772]  Well, then why do you put your wallet in your back pocket so somebody can't get it as easy, or your front pocket?
[01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:05.013]  Why do you have walls?
[01:19:05.053 --> 01:19:05.773]  Why do you have doors?
[01:19:05.833 --> 01:19:06.634]  Why do you wear clothing?
[01:19:06.874 --> 01:19:08.875]  Why do you have screens on your windows?
[01:19:09.055 --> 01:19:10.656]  Because there's bad things that can come in.
[01:19:10.956 --> 01:19:15.079]  Well, I mean, here's a bad, I shouldn't confess this, but my wife and I are home over the holidays.
[01:19:15.139 --> 01:19:18.401]  We've got Alexa on, whom we rarely use, and we wanted to hear some Christmas music.
[01:19:18.781 --> 01:19:20.142]  Alexa, play Christmas music.
[01:19:20.462 --> 01:19:25.626]  And I knew damn well that Alexa was listening and that I'd invited this electronic ear into the house.
[01:19:25.926 --> 01:19:30.089]  But for the convenience of listening to Christmas carols, I was willing to sacrifice privacy.
[01:19:30.409 --> 01:19:38.254]  I think more and more people are seduced by gadgetry and convenience, and they're willing to give it up until they've given up too much, and then it'll be too late.
[01:19:40.916 --> 01:19:42.497]  I don't know.
[01:20:00.836 --> 01:20:09.682]  And the phone's sitting right there in the center console of my Dodge vehicle, and she starts screaming and everything, and the thing turns on and is sitting there.
[01:20:09.982 --> 01:20:11.203]  She absolutely was freaked out.
[01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.023]  Well, here's another story.
[01:20:12.043 --> 01:20:18.507]  A friend of mine is a psychiatrist, and he tells me that in two recent occasions, he and his patients have discussed some particular topic.
[01:20:18.768 --> 01:20:25.292]  Within 24 hours, the patients, in their private sessions with their phones off, the patients got advertisements.
[01:20:25.492 --> 01:20:32.242]  Oh yeah, that's all, absolutely, that's admitted going back at least a decade in terms of service with Sam Tung's TVs.
[01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:38.030]  It says, literally, we're going to sell the audio and more to third parties, so watch what you say.
[01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:38.591]  Wow.
[01:20:38.892 --> 01:20:40.394]  It actually says watch what you say.
[01:20:41.536 --> 01:20:45.879]  I like to say, I mean, I was on a radio show not long ago, and I wanted to see if it would work.
[01:20:45.919 --> 01:20:46.700]  I don't know if it did.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:50.662]  So we were talking about this very topic, and I said, Siri, play Purple Haze.
[01:20:51.043 --> 01:20:55.606]  And I don't know how many people got Jimi Hendrix on that day, or whether Siri doesn't listen to the radio.
[01:20:56.086 --> 01:20:56.646]  We didn't find out.
[01:20:56.666 --> 01:20:57.667]  No, that's absolutely right.
[01:20:57.727 --> 01:21:01.910]  And that's called training, Siri training, audience training.
[01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:10.476]  And where they're actually doing that now with radio and TV, that's why they're now adding big network subtones that communicate with it.
[01:21:11.724 --> 01:21:15.566]  You ever seen how in Star Wars, made back in the 1970s, how do the robots communicate?
[01:21:17.287 --> 01:21:19.568]  That's because they went to engineers and said, I want a robot talk.
[01:21:19.588 --> 01:21:21.649]  So it's the secret world of machines.
[01:21:21.949 --> 01:21:32.814]  It turns out all these devices, even down to toasters now, and smart refrigerators, even digital radios, are putting out sub-audible tones, and tones that are above audible.
[01:21:35.515 --> 01:21:42.979]  That way there's not even wireless connections but they're communicating that way and then transmitting the data compressed to each other and so that's what they're doing.
[01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:44.160]  That's terrifying.
[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:47.001]  I mean it's terrifying but what are we going to do about it?
[01:21:47.101 --> 01:21:49.022]  It's almost like it's gone too far.
[01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:50.283]  How do you go back?
[01:21:50.623 --> 01:21:52.024]  What does R2 say when he sees something scary?
[01:21:55.742 --> 01:22:06.270]  But remember Captain Crunch back in the 70s was able to call into the White House and able to get on the line with Nixon and get through codes and stuff because he could whistle so good off of the telephone code system.
[01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:07.111]  He had a telephone code.
[01:22:07.751 --> 01:22:09.773]  And of course those guys use a phone with codes.
[01:22:09.993 --> 01:22:10.893]  They plug into your phone.
[01:22:11.074 --> 01:22:12.835]  But you can do it with your voice.
[01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:13.355]  Wow.
[01:22:13.555 --> 01:22:15.317]  That's a brave new world.
[01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:16.818]  Captain Crunch was the first hacker.
[01:22:17.078 --> 01:22:17.739]  Scary stuff.
[01:22:18.473 --> 01:22:19.914]  We've had him on the show.
[01:22:19.954 --> 01:22:22.316]  But again, and I'm not trying to one-up each time you mention something.
[01:22:22.356 --> 01:22:22.636]  No, no.
[01:22:22.656 --> 01:22:27.240]  I never even thought about them listening to your private conversations with your psychiatrists, but this is what's going on.
[01:22:31.784 --> 01:22:34.286]  I was watching the thing, and it's a scary world.
[01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:37.208]  We don't seem to be prepared to stop it at all.
[01:22:37.248 --> 01:22:38.309]  We're not making the effort.
[01:22:38.329 --> 01:22:41.792]  There is not a sophisticated effort for privacy right now.
[01:22:42.032 --> 01:22:47.637]  And I do this all the time too, and they'll put something on screen, I like pause, and that's just part of being distracted with television.
[01:22:48.217 --> 01:22:49.498]  Is it weird to be in a TV studio like this?
[01:22:49.638 --> 01:22:50.179]  Yeah, it is.
[01:22:50.379 --> 01:22:51.780]  I'm trying not to watch.
[01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:53.362]  Trying not to watch.
[01:22:53.622 --> 01:22:56.144]  I learned a long time ago as a lawyer, never read your own press.
[01:22:56.164 --> 01:22:57.245]  Now I'm learning sitting with you.
[01:22:57.565 --> 01:23:01.169]  Never look at yourself on the screen because you're thinking, man, he looks so much better than I do.
[01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.210]  It's just not fair.
[01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:03.591]  Oh, yeah, right.
[01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:04.892]  The marathon runner over here.
[01:23:05.192 --> 01:23:07.514]  This guy's mean, let me tell you.
[01:23:07.534 --> 01:23:07.975]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:23:08.035 --> 01:23:10.957]  Early hackers use whistles from Captain Crunch cereal boxes.
[01:23:11.735 --> 01:23:14.318]  And the guy that taught him how to do it got the nickname Captain Crunch.
[01:23:14.358 --> 01:23:20.905]  But I know new listeners, they'll like Young Turks and CNN play clips of me saying this and go, look how crazy he is.
[01:23:21.205 --> 01:23:24.108]  He says there's animal human clones in China.
[01:23:24.508 --> 01:23:29.854]  The ability to take a snippet and make it into the whole presentation of a person is just plain wrong.
[01:23:30.414 --> 01:23:38.319]  And I'm not, you know, I mean, one of the things I like most about coming out to see you, candidly, is the ride in the cab from the airport to the hotel.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:47.686]  Because I get to talk to a real person who's not mediated by electronic chatter, who's not an adversary in a courtroom, and I get to find out what people are thinking about what's life on the street.
[01:23:47.986 --> 01:23:51.889]  Well, how often do you get to just go and shake the hand of a stranger and say, how you doing today?
[01:23:51.909 --> 01:23:57.152]  Trump is obsessed with real contact with real people, and that's the difference between America and Europe, where it was all about royalty.
[01:23:57.592 --> 01:23:58.993]  Alexander de Tocqueville wrote about that.
[01:23:59.293 --> 01:23:59.834]  It was about
[01:24:00.834 --> 01:24:04.036]  You know, realizing that real innovation and stuff comes from the grassroots.
[01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:08.097]  And when you celebrate the grassroots, it makes it even more powerful and makes it more vibrant.
[01:24:08.117 --> 01:24:12.319]  But everything today is about suppressing the grassroots and programming us with Hollywood garbage.
[01:24:12.579 --> 01:24:17.701]  You know, I go out all the time and, you know, I take security with me if I'm going into what I call a blue zone.
[01:24:18.101 --> 01:24:23.584]  Any leftist area, any zombie infested area, downtown Austin, Congress Street, I still go to those zones.
[01:24:24.784 --> 01:24:26.365]  I do usually take a security person with me.
[01:24:27.526 --> 01:24:29.689]  And it's just something that has to be done.
[01:24:29.729 --> 01:24:32.133]  But most areas, people love him for it.
[01:24:32.413 --> 01:24:34.536]  So the enemy propaganda to hate us has not worked.
[01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:36.385]  It's funny you should mention that.
[01:24:36.425 --> 01:24:48.748]  I remember being out with you one evening at a local eatery and you stopped to talk to some people and they were smiling and all of a sudden the temperature level began to rise and they weren't smiling because they liked you, they were smiling because they were telling you off.
[01:24:49.088 --> 01:24:51.109]  And they were wishing harm to your family.
[01:24:51.549 --> 01:24:52.729]  And I was like, really?
[01:24:52.989 --> 01:24:54.110]  This is Saturday night?
[01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:56.810]  Yeah, I was walking by and I shook the hands of some listeners.
[01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:57.050]  Right.
[01:24:57.231 --> 01:24:58.551]  And then somebody goes, I hope you die.
[01:24:58.631 --> 01:24:59.451]  Yeah, I couldn't believe that.
[01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:00.531]  Because they're trying to provoke me.
[01:25:00.551 --> 01:25:02.832]  And then they all got their camera away because they all planned it.
[01:25:03.092 --> 01:25:04.214]  But here's the funny thing.
[01:25:04.494 --> 01:25:08.319]  You had that confrontation and the thought occurred to me, do I want to get in a fistfight in Austin?
[01:25:08.339 --> 01:25:09.300]  And I thought, well, okay.
[01:25:09.861 --> 01:25:18.351]  But then when it was over and you disengaged, they sat there looking smug, but everybody in the restaurant, everybody else clapped for you, not for them.
[01:25:18.452 --> 01:25:19.533]  So keep doing what you're doing.
[01:25:19.713 --> 01:25:20.694]  I remember that, yeah.
[01:25:20.774 --> 01:25:21.714]  I remember it very well.
[01:25:22.095 --> 01:25:24.736]  It was the night that I knew I was being retained in the Dulos case.
[01:25:24.836 --> 01:25:26.037]  You and I talked about that.
[01:25:26.397 --> 01:25:29.900]  And we're leaving and I'm thinking, do I really want to spend the night in an Austin jail?
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.942]  Do you think I was measured enough, though, when I threatened my family?
[01:25:34.282 --> 01:25:35.043]  F you and your family.
[01:25:35.083 --> 01:25:36.364]  You know, here's what I would tell you.
[01:25:36.384 --> 01:25:37.785]  I said it already today.
[01:25:37.885 --> 01:25:40.186]  Back in 70 seconds, then we'll hit the Smollett News.
[01:25:40.206 --> 01:25:41.187]  And we've got other guests joining us.
[01:25:43.447 --> 01:25:47.428]  Norm Pattis is here, and I've not had too much coffee.
[01:25:47.948 --> 01:25:52.130]  I've just been working out a lot more, and I've been taking the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:52.710]  I'm not kidding.
[01:25:52.730 --> 01:25:53.830]  I didn't even plug last hour.
[01:25:53.850 --> 01:25:58.011]  I keep saying the sale's gonna end in a day, but I've not had time to cut new ads in over a week.
[01:25:58.652 --> 01:26:01.312]  And a lot of stuff sold out, because I kept the biggest sale in our history going.
[01:26:01.693 --> 01:26:02.973]  A bunch of stuff's about to sell out.
[01:26:03.293 --> 01:26:04.593]  Up to 75% off.
[01:26:04.633 --> 01:26:05.994]  Storewide free Shopee Double Patreon points.
[01:26:06.354 --> 01:26:11.816]  So, a lot of great products are still there and still available that have been sold out, like Vazo Beads and Brain Force Plus.
[01:26:11.936 --> 01:26:12.876]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:26:13.456 --> 01:26:20.279]  And a few things will continue through the weekend, but as soon as I get off today, I'm going to go work on the ads, and then I'm going to meet with this guy.
[01:26:20.299 --> 01:26:21.520]  We've got a lot of stuff going on.
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:23.781]  Norm, you were getting into going into the Blue Zone.
[01:26:24.862 --> 01:26:25.842]  I picked you up at your hotel.
[01:26:25.862 --> 01:26:26.462]  We were hungry.
[01:26:26.743 --> 01:26:27.603]  We've been doing some stuff.
[01:26:28.904 --> 01:26:37.508]  We went over and ate at a Mexican food restaurant that's in the Blue Zone on South Lamar, near downtown, and you were getting into what happened.
[01:26:37.932 --> 01:26:44.958]  Yeah, so we're leaving and people are stopping to shake your hand and I'm just enjoying the spectacle of it all.
[01:26:44.998 --> 01:26:50.142]  We turn a corner to leave and I look and you're not there and you're stopping, you're bent over talking to somebody.
[01:26:50.542 --> 01:26:52.904]  And he's smiling at you like he's happy to see you.
[01:26:53.284 --> 01:26:57.147]  And then I hear the F-bomb dropped in reference to you and your family too.
[01:26:57.708 --> 01:26:59.229]  And I couldn't figure it out.
[01:26:59.249 --> 01:27:00.950]  I'm like, is this some sort of inside joke?
[01:27:01.131 --> 01:27:02.952]  And you looked at him as though to say, really?
[01:27:03.092 --> 01:27:04.593]  What did you just say and bent over?
[01:27:04.613 --> 01:27:07.435]  And I don't recall the exact conversation.
[01:27:07.475 --> 01:27:08.776]  I don't know that I would have thereafter.
[01:27:08.816 --> 01:27:09.356]  I was shocked.
[01:27:09.716 --> 01:27:12.478]  But it quickly descended into fighting words.
[01:27:12.899 --> 01:27:16.401]  And so I'm thinking, as a lawyer, what are my responsibilities here?
[01:27:16.421 --> 01:27:18.282]  And then I said, what the hell with the lawyerly thing?
[01:27:18.302 --> 01:27:20.263]  What are my responsibilities as a man and a friend?
[01:27:20.283 --> 01:27:21.724]  As I turned around, you were all ready to go.
[01:27:21.804 --> 01:27:22.145]  I was.
[01:27:23.265 --> 01:27:25.006]  There were three or four of them there, and it was you.
[01:27:25.067 --> 01:27:27.848]  I don't doubt you could have taken care of them, but it wouldn't have been sporting.
[01:27:27.888 --> 01:27:30.050]  So I was going to try to level the playing field a little bit.
[01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:37.733]  Um, and so then, you know, you basically told them off, and as you stood up, um, and, and the restaurant fell quiet.
[01:27:37.793 --> 01:27:39.173]  Everyone turned to look as you stood up.
[01:27:39.193 --> 01:27:40.214]  Well, yeah, I got in his face.
[01:27:40.274 --> 01:27:41.314]  I leaned right down over his food.
[01:27:41.354 --> 01:27:41.834]  Oh, you did?
[01:27:41.934 --> 01:27:42.214]  Yeah.
[01:27:42.274 --> 01:27:43.375]  No, and then people clapped.
[01:27:43.395 --> 01:27:46.476]  That happened a few months ago, and I just reached over and took a piece of the guy's steak and ate it.
[01:27:46.656 --> 01:27:47.196]  Did you really?
[01:27:47.236 --> 01:27:47.536]  Yeah.
[01:27:47.736 --> 01:27:48.157]  In private?
[01:27:48.177 --> 01:27:48.857]  And was it good?
[01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:50.297]  Well, he said he was going to kick my ass.
[01:27:50.337 --> 01:27:51.758]  I said, well, get up, and he wouldn't do it.
[01:27:52.218 --> 01:27:56.480]  So then I just leaned over and said, because you're a coward, you're showing off for your wife.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.660]  I go, this is the third dimension, buddy.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.521]  This ain't the internet where you're acting tough, and I ate his steak.
[01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:02.144]  Well, I shouldn't even tell those stories, but just go ahead.
[01:28:02.364 --> 01:28:04.787]  No, I mean, that's a kind of gutsy move.
[01:28:04.807 --> 01:28:06.989]  You're going to kick my whatever?
[01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:08.631]  Well, I'm going to eat your steak.
[01:28:08.691 --> 01:28:12.015]  I'm going to eat it medium rare, I'm going to eat it medium well, I'm going to eat it well done.
[01:28:15.719 --> 01:28:23.443]  They were flying back from Denver to Austin with us.
[01:28:23.743 --> 01:28:24.984]  They started a fight with my son.
[01:28:25.084 --> 01:28:25.744]  He's really big now.
[01:28:25.764 --> 01:28:26.365]  This was two years ago.
[01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:28.626]  But he was, you know, he looked like he was about 17 then.
[01:28:28.866 --> 01:28:29.367]  He's 17 now.
[01:28:29.507 --> 01:28:29.947]  Looks like he's 25.
[01:28:30.107 --> 01:28:33.449]  The linebacker, you know, for some college team.
[01:28:33.489 --> 01:28:36.411]  But they were going F you to me.
[01:28:36.491 --> 01:28:37.611]  And he said, hey, leave my dad alone.
[01:28:37.631 --> 01:28:40.013]  Well later they started a fight with him at the baggage area.
[01:28:40.523 --> 01:28:43.183]  They went to him, and we're trying to start a fight.
[01:28:43.243 --> 01:28:44.204]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:28:44.364 --> 01:28:50.245]  Years ago, I represented a guy who'd been shot by a hitman, and we determined that this was part of a business dispute.
[01:28:50.265 --> 01:28:52.945]  These were very prominent weightlifters, and we knew who paid for it.
[01:28:53.365 --> 01:28:54.545]  So I went down to visit the guy.
[01:28:54.585 --> 01:28:57.446]  He was in the Belglades Correctional Center in Belglades, Florida.
[01:28:57.946 --> 01:29:03.007]  And he came out for his deposition in the prison with these Ray-Ban glasses, and he wouldn't swear the oath.
[01:29:03.067 --> 01:29:06.528]  And I'm sitting across the table from him, and he says, I know you.
[01:29:07.048 --> 01:29:08.688]  You think you're a tough guy, don't you?
[01:29:09.328 --> 01:29:09.849]  No, not really.
[01:29:26.656 --> 01:29:30.298]  I know Bubba and your buddies down here haven't been treating you well, but I got news for you.
[01:29:31.138 --> 01:29:35.380]  When I like females, I like females in skirts.
[01:29:35.521 --> 01:29:37.882]  And you wouldn't look good in skirts, A.H.
[01:29:38.182 --> 01:29:42.004]  And the guy leapt across the table at me, and the guards separated him.
[01:29:42.424 --> 01:29:51.873]  So we didn't do the deposition, and then I sued him for costs and seized his commissary account for a while to defray the cost of my flight down there.
[01:29:52.414 --> 01:29:54.236]  In the end, we won the case.
[01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.318]  He ended up doing some more time.
[01:29:56.698 --> 01:30:01.603]  And he periodically threatened my life, and I'd get calls from the DOC saying that this guy was out to get me.
[01:30:02.504 --> 01:30:03.825]  And, you know, here I am.
[01:30:04.045 --> 01:30:10.252]  So as I said to the last guy who threatened to shoot me to my face, I said, if you shoot me, get me right here in Newfoundland.
[01:30:10.312 --> 01:30:10.773]  I love it!
[01:30:10.813 --> 01:30:15.418]  Because if you get me anywhere else, I'm going to hurt you on the way down.
[01:30:15.438 --> 01:30:17.180]  I don't want to interrupt, but I'm leaving.
[01:30:18.524 --> 01:30:19.504]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[01:30:19.564 --> 01:30:21.765]  You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregg Reese.
[01:30:22.165 --> 01:30:25.246]  And, of course, Harris and Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:26.587]  The crew's volunteered to do it.
[01:30:26.847 --> 01:30:29.928]  So we're here live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[01:30:30.288 --> 01:30:31.489]  So the live coverage continues.
[01:30:31.549 --> 01:30:32.609]  Everybody spread those links.
[01:30:32.889 --> 01:30:35.210]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:35.830]  Don't let them win.
[01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:36.590]  No BS.
[01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:38.511]  Let me tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[01:30:38.711 --> 01:30:40.412]  See, I don't have some Machiavelli manipulative view.
[01:30:41.152 --> 01:30:43.693]  With me, it's all straightforward attacks!
[01:30:43.793 --> 01:30:50.615]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[01:30:50.956 --> 01:30:53.156]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:30:53.196 --> 01:30:54.557]  We love the American people.
[01:31:05.769 --> 01:31:07.950]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:09.451]  We love the American people.
[01:31:09.471 --> 01:31:12.752]  We love the American people.
[01:31:12.852 --> 01:31:14.473]  We love the American people.
[01:31:15.273 --> 01:31:29.119]  They came in peace.
[01:31:29.159 --> 01:31:31.340]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.761]  We love the American people.
[01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:41.811]  This is CNN.
[01:31:46.052 --> 01:31:53.675]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:31:53.915 --> 01:31:55.975]  And we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:31:56.095 --> 01:32:00.077]  I am your host Alex Jones, famous constitutional lawyer, criminal lawyer, first woman lawyer.
[01:32:00.457 --> 01:32:01.457]  Norm Pattis is here.
[01:32:01.897 --> 01:32:04.598]  You were talking about internet surveillance and how dangerous it is.
[01:32:05.339 --> 01:32:08.740]  And there's a lot of things that can be done with this system that we're going to like.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:12.642]  But that's the road to hell being paved with good intentions.
[01:32:12.662 --> 01:32:16.605]  We have a very special investigative journalist joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:32:16.645 --> 01:32:19.948]  Norm, look at this article by Kellan McBreen on Infowars.com.
[01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:24.431]  Judge orders Google to turn over one year of Jesse Smollett's data.
[01:32:24.792 --> 01:32:25.772]  Now clearly he did it.
[01:32:26.113 --> 01:32:29.115]  The guys that did it have admitted they did it for him under pay.
[01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:32.578]  They have a video of them buying the ski masks and the rope all at the same store.
[01:32:33.098 --> 01:32:33.859]  It's all fake.
[01:32:33.919 --> 01:32:37.942]  It was to reboost the show, saying he's under right-wing Trump attack.
[01:32:39.063 --> 01:32:40.504]  The show is probably in on it.
[01:32:40.764 --> 01:32:42.546]  Maxine Waters says it's fine, he did it.
[01:32:43.326 --> 01:32:50.893]  He's now had charges dropped on him, as you know, and he's suing the police for false arrest and false prosecution and a bunch of craziness.
[01:32:51.173 --> 01:32:59.480]  So now a judge has ruled that Google is going to give his metadata, his travel data, everything he wrote or said on the emails, over to them.
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.342]  And you know that's going to do to Smollett.
[01:33:01.362 --> 01:33:03.124]  He's not really planned this out too well.
[01:33:03.729 --> 01:33:04.269]  Apparently not.
[01:33:04.289 --> 01:33:08.533]  It's very difficult to sue a police officer for false arrest or malicious prosecution.
[01:33:08.573 --> 01:33:15.058]  You have to show a judge to survive the motions and get to a jury that the action was altogether lacking in probable cause.
[01:33:15.358 --> 01:33:20.342]  In other words, there was no reasonable basis to believe that the person engaged in the conduct complained of.
[01:33:21.643 --> 01:33:24.745]  I'm not sure why they dropped the charge.
[01:33:25.206 --> 01:33:27.347]  I think he's not going to be able to prevail on that suit.
[01:33:27.387 --> 01:33:34.353]  Now, if in the Google metadata and data it turns out that they can show conclusively that he planned it, he's going to get charged all over again.
[01:33:35.574 --> 01:33:39.357]  The fact that the charges were dropped the first time doesn't toll the statute of limitations.
[01:33:39.817 --> 01:33:45.382]  I don't know whether that's a one-year or a five-year statute off the top of my head, but we'll find out.
[01:33:46.002 --> 01:33:47.643]  I'm surprised though that Google turned it over.
[01:33:47.703 --> 01:33:50.764]  It's hard to get social media to cooperate with law enforcement, you know?
[01:33:52.245 --> 01:33:54.006]  But that's going to be happening more and more.
[01:33:54.586 --> 01:33:57.987]  Social media doesn't like to cooperate because it shows they're surveilling and recording everything.
[01:33:58.008 --> 01:34:04.931]  Now we have courses, you know, being taught at major colleges for how law enforcement does get
[01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:08.091]  Well, here's the problem with that, too.
[01:34:08.111 --> 01:34:14.956]  I learned by surprise and by accident in a Connecticut case that a judge made an order that Facebook had to turn something over to the defense, and Facebook didn't do it.
[01:34:27.626 --> 01:34:30.628]  So, we filed a motion to compel Facebook to do it.
[01:34:30.648 --> 01:34:31.289]  They ignored that.
[01:34:31.349 --> 01:34:34.091]  So, I did what's called a capious warrant for Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:34:34.411 --> 01:34:35.812]  And we had him served at his home.
[01:34:36.493 --> 01:34:41.316]  And that was to hold him in contempt of court for failure to obey the court's order.
[01:34:41.656 --> 01:34:44.118]  Facebook got a lawyer and we sat down and talked.
[01:34:44.558 --> 01:34:47.961]  And here's what I learned from Facebook's internal communications.
[01:34:48.781 --> 01:34:53.445]  They will comply with a subpoena from law enforcement, from the state or from the government.
[01:34:53.645 --> 01:34:56.427]  They will not comply with a subpoena from defense counsel.
[01:34:56.707 --> 01:34:57.388]  How does that work?
[01:34:57.768 --> 01:35:00.511]  How is it that the truth serves one side and not the other?
[01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:05.136]  How is it that the truth serves power but not people who the power is supposed to serve?
[01:35:12.143 --> 01:35:17.446]  They will respond to a subpoena by prosecutors, by government, but not by defense.
[01:35:17.886 --> 01:35:28.711]  If that precedent continues, and everything's based on this, then this is truly a nightmare system of the technocracy, and that's another key point in how authoritarian it is from its very onset.
[01:35:28.871 --> 01:35:40.825]  Well, yes, and it's also a key part of the argument that says we should apply First Amendment standards to these entities because they become quasi-governmental in how they behave.
[01:35:41.205 --> 01:35:48.594]  If you're willing to share everything you own with the government but not with a private person, you begin to behave like the government and you begin to become an arm of the government.
[01:35:49.254 --> 01:36:03.249]  So, we have a suit pending against Facebook for banning a Connecticut person from social media, a young law student named Cameron Atkinson, and we've pled that as one of the factors that the court should consider in determining that Facebook is quasi-governmental.
[01:36:04.278 --> 01:36:08.579]  Well, they advertise they're a utility, and so they have liability protection, section 230.
[01:36:08.619 --> 01:36:09.039]  Right.
[01:36:10.079 --> 01:36:10.879]  And what is the answer?
[01:36:10.919 --> 01:36:11.840]  Strip them of the immunity?
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:16.741]  No, because then the EU and the globalists and the CHICOMs are coming in, saying their regulations are over.
[01:36:16.781 --> 01:36:19.641]  Trump, in the new trade law, says no, they still have the immunity.
[01:36:20.161 --> 01:36:27.883]  Okay, but then you can't then sit there and have it all programmed to censor everybody, especially people that expose sexualization of children.
[01:36:28.563 --> 01:36:29.944]  Radical Islam's expansion.
[01:36:30.044 --> 01:36:37.970]  These things are being protected, particularly by big tech, and they're meeting and making agreements and acting as combines.
[01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:43.193]  On January 8th of 2019, I killed my Facebook account.
[01:36:43.233 --> 01:36:44.114]  It's been almost a year.
[01:36:44.154 --> 01:36:55.421]  And I did it because I was so outraged to learn that they're profiting off of me, taking my data, selling it, recombining it, and then they're going to tell me what I can and can't post by opaque standards that I can't know.
[01:36:55.821 --> 01:36:56.622]  That's offensive.
[01:36:56.742 --> 01:36:58.143]  But you know, Alex, I miss it.
[01:36:58.483 --> 01:36:59.523]  I met a lot of people there.
[01:36:59.623 --> 01:37:00.684]  I like mouthing off.
[01:37:00.764 --> 01:37:01.885]  I like vigorous debate.
[01:37:02.205 --> 01:37:08.959]  But I can't go back to Facebook any more than I could walk into a locker room with a tube of Vaseline and say to everybody there, have at it, fellas.
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:10.001]  It's just not in me.
[01:37:11.468 --> 01:37:15.709]  And it's that American spirit of rugged individualism that's going to be the answer.
[01:37:15.829 --> 01:37:21.510]  And Facebook and Google and Apple and Twitter, when you try to set up an alternative, they go and get you deplatformed.
[01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:22.910]  They go after the server companies.
[01:37:23.631 --> 01:37:24.251]  They do it all.
[01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:25.511]  The media gangs up on you.
[01:37:25.551 --> 01:37:28.892]  If one person says kill somebody on Gab, they try to ban it.
[01:37:29.212 --> 01:37:31.912]  But then a guy massacres people on Facebook and that's okay.
[01:37:32.192 --> 01:37:34.693]  Well, yeah, because the guy did it live.
[01:37:34.873 --> 01:37:40.474]  It's very scary, but you don't ban everybody's live streaming because a bad person did something wrong with something.
[01:37:40.914 --> 01:37:41.334]  No, you don't.
[01:37:42.916 --> 01:37:45.698]  It's the same argument over and over and over again.
[01:37:45.718 --> 01:37:49.060]  I think we can thank Adam Walsh and folks like that for it.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:55.024]  Something catastrophic happens in your family and you conclude that you should become a spokesman for interests broader than your grief.
[01:37:55.385 --> 01:38:03.450]  And then we end up with these patchwork quilts of legal regulations and rules that make no sense because they're grounded in pathos, not reason.
[01:38:03.791 --> 01:38:07.033]  We need to get back to a situation in this country where people can debate
[01:38:07.353 --> 01:38:10.115]  Calmly and dispassionately about what's in the public interest.
[01:38:10.356 --> 01:38:12.798]  And that means no holes barred debate.
[01:38:13.458 --> 01:38:17.281]  You can't decide that because, you know, Alex Jones says things that are controversial.
[01:38:17.601 --> 01:38:19.163]  He's too hateful to be listened to.
[01:38:19.883 --> 01:38:23.126]  The minute you're shut down, the country is impoverished in my view.
[01:38:23.226 --> 01:38:24.307]  I may not always agree.
[01:38:24.387 --> 01:38:26.388]  Sometimes I don't even understand everything you say.
[01:38:26.929 --> 01:38:29.491]  But boy, I'll fight to the death for your right to say it.
[01:38:29.531 --> 01:38:32.734]  Because when your voice is gone, what's left?
[01:38:33.294 --> 01:38:34.895]  Well, sometimes I don't understand what I say.
[01:38:34.915 --> 01:38:36.096]  I'll hear something in hindsight.
[01:38:36.596 --> 01:38:38.157]  And I'm like, what was I thinking when I said that?
[01:38:38.197 --> 01:38:40.178]  It's because I'm not pre-programming.
[01:38:40.218 --> 01:38:43.000]  I'm not getting everything ready and written down what I'm going to say.
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:44.982]  And then sometimes a lot's going on.
[01:38:45.722 --> 01:38:53.347]  And, you know, who knows, you know, maybe sometimes like they come in and are serving me with a service deal and the service person's standing here and I'm
[01:38:53.587 --> 01:38:59.212]  Talking on air, or my wife comes to the office, or my kids are running around, and then I kind of scramble something.
[01:38:59.432 --> 01:39:00.413]  I'm glad to hear you say that.
[01:39:00.633 --> 01:39:04.196]  I have to unfortunately read transcripts any number of times of cases I've been in.
[01:39:04.556 --> 01:39:06.638]  And you know, I'll come home, my wife will say, how was your day?
[01:39:06.698 --> 01:39:07.319]  Oh, pretty good.
[01:39:07.359 --> 01:39:09.180]  I really kicked so-and-so where it hurt.
[01:39:09.461 --> 01:39:13.164]  And then I'll read the transcript, and I'm looking like a blind man walking into a wall.
[01:39:13.598 --> 01:39:17.442]  We're doing our best in real time with the situations that confront us as they do.
[01:39:17.542 --> 01:39:18.463]  Sometimes we mess up.
[01:39:18.583 --> 01:39:19.323]  That's the way it is.
[01:39:19.383 --> 01:39:24.328]  What about the days where you gotta do the case but you got a stomach bug or something and you're just making yourself go through it?
[01:39:24.688 --> 01:39:27.811]  But the weirdest thing is under that kind of stress sometimes I say the best stuff.
[01:39:28.749 --> 01:39:37.113]  Yeah, I think when I have more, I have found that the same, you know, from time to time I've lost a brief for an appellate court by hitting the wrong key and then I have to rewrite it quickly.
[01:39:37.153 --> 01:39:42.136]  The rewrites are always better because that's when the pressure's on and I don't have time to dilly-dally and shoot myself.
[01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:42.656]  That's right.
[01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:43.817]  Let's play Danger Zone.
[01:39:43.837 --> 01:39:46.118]  We come in with a lady that's been in the Danger Zone.
[01:39:46.438 --> 01:39:48.059]  You talk about a patriot to humanity.
[01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:49.019]  She's amazing.
[01:39:49.039 --> 01:39:51.441]  We're going to be talking to her on the other side.
[01:39:51.541 --> 01:39:53.321]  So wait and we'll tell you who she is.
[01:39:53.922 --> 01:39:55.543]  We're very excited she's here with us.
[01:39:55.583 --> 01:39:56.003]  Stay with us.
[01:39:58.607 --> 01:40:00.889]  Cynthia Farahat has been on the broadcast before.
[01:40:00.929 --> 01:40:02.951]  You've probably seen her on international television.
[01:40:03.792 --> 01:40:08.156]  She's one of the best known female reporters in the Middle East.
[01:40:10.666 --> 01:40:14.590]  She's a very smart lady, also a very beautiful lady, and she's with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:40:14.610 --> 01:40:15.772]  I really appreciate her coming on.
[01:40:15.812 --> 01:40:17.153]  CynthiaFarahat.com.
[01:40:17.414 --> 01:40:20.877]  Farahat is, just like it sounds, F-A-R-A-H-A-T.
[01:40:21.558 --> 01:40:24.141]  And you can see unvarnished reporting.
[01:40:24.562 --> 01:40:28.646]  I wouldn't call it right-wing, I wouldn't call it left-wing, I would just call it really truth journalism.
[01:40:29.307 --> 01:40:31.409]  She was in the middle of the Globalist-funded
[01:40:32.296 --> 01:40:37.300]  Deep state overthrow of the Middle East and our allies and putting the Muslim Brotherhood in charge.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:39.803]  And I really wanted to get her on a few weeks ago, but she couldn't come on.
[01:40:40.103 --> 01:40:41.784]  Well, since then, the Middle East has blown up.
[01:40:41.985 --> 01:40:42.465]  Iran.
[01:40:42.485 --> 01:40:48.130]  I want to get her expert take on all of this and where she sees all of this going.
[01:40:48.150 --> 01:40:50.192]  A famous constitutional lawyer, criminal lawyer.
[01:40:50.592 --> 01:40:53.615]  Where would you like to start in the context of all of this?
[01:41:10.738 --> 01:41:23.240]  I would like to tell President Donald Trump, thank you for finally getting rid of the worst monster in the Middle East, Qasem al-Suleimani.
[01:41:23.941 --> 01:41:36.323]  This man was more dangerous than Osama bin Laden, the blind sheikh, who was the godfather of Islamic terrorism, and al-Baghdadi of ISIS combined.
[01:41:37.287 --> 01:41:41.393]  This is one of the most dangerous monsters on planet Earth.
[01:41:41.653 --> 01:41:45.859]  And finally, President Trump did the right thing.
[01:41:46.861 --> 01:41:53.150]  So it's a great, great achievement of his administration, of his foreign policy.
[01:41:54.090 --> 01:41:59.778]  Well, he was on the terror list, so how is Trump a war criminal now?
[01:41:59.798 --> 01:42:09.372]  The Democrats, as you know, want him impeached for killing Soleimani, who's admittedly bragged about creating the worldwide IED program that killed thousands of troops.
[01:42:10.993 --> 01:42:12.434]  Well, it's not new.
[01:42:13.956 --> 01:42:20.522]  They have been on the wrong side of history consistently for hundreds of years.
[01:42:20.882 --> 01:42:23.325]  And leftists, that's the mode of operation.
[01:42:23.365 --> 01:42:24.686]  It's never going to change.
[01:42:25.006 --> 01:42:29.651]  We are dealing with this disaster right now because President Jimmy Carter
[01:42:30.251 --> 01:42:35.495]  That was an Israeli journalist who called him the Godfather of the Iranian Revolution.
[01:42:35.875 --> 01:42:41.519]  Yes, Jimmy Carter is the Godfather of the regime that we're dealing with right now.
[01:42:41.859 --> 01:42:49.324]  Let me give you a few very nice quotations that have been long forgotten in American history, unfortunately.
[01:42:50.669 --> 01:42:57.913]  Carter's ambassador to the UN, Andrew Young, said that Khomeini will eventually be hailed as a saint.
[01:42:58.293 --> 01:42:59.394]  These are policies from 1979.
[01:43:01.855 --> 01:43:07.178]  Look at what they're saying on one of the worst people in the history of the planet.
[01:43:07.759 --> 01:43:13.862]  Carter's Iranian ambassador, William Sullivan, said that Khomeini is a Gandhi-like figure.
[01:43:14.362 --> 01:43:19.185]  These are the people, these are the same people right now who are
[01:43:20.194 --> 01:43:24.637]  I'm so outraged about President Trump doing the right thing.
[01:43:25.438 --> 01:43:26.959]  We are here because of them.
[01:43:26.979 --> 01:43:29.401]  We are in this situation because of them.
[01:43:30.261 --> 01:43:35.505]  They need to either support the President or not say anything at all.
[01:43:38.334 --> 01:43:40.895]  Where do you expect this to go?
[01:43:40.975 --> 01:43:47.399]  Because a lot of people just go, oh it's the Iranian people, and I don't like regime change, I don't like war, and I elected Trump to de-escalate things.
[01:43:47.419 --> 01:43:50.220]  I think he's trying to get out of the Middle East, but Soleimani's been expanding.
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:56.003]  I don't think people realize that the numbers of people killed by the Iranian regime, they're very unpopular.
[01:43:56.424 --> 01:44:01.646]  They put women in prison that don't wear hijabs or try to have jobs that they're not allowed to have.
[01:44:02.887 --> 01:44:07.550]  They've killed thousands the last few months, mowing them down for protesting the Ayatollah.
[01:44:07.610 --> 01:44:12.934]  So, the left just celebrating the Iranian dictatorship is bizarre.
[01:44:14.059 --> 01:44:17.660]  They're in love with every single dictatorship.
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:31.725]  If you remember a very, very long time ago when Stalin was committing atrocities and killing millions of people, the New York Times, Walter Duranty was whitewashing his war crimes.
[01:44:32.165 --> 01:44:32.886]  What changed?
[01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:34.226]  Nothing changed.
[01:44:34.546 --> 01:44:40.108]  It's the same exact thing over and over and over again, and they will never learn and never change.
[01:44:40.528 --> 01:44:42.149]  What I see happening is I think
[01:44:42.789 --> 01:44:50.095]  The killing, the assassination of the beast Soleimani is a de-escalation actually.
[01:44:50.415 --> 01:44:52.457]  This is actually safer for all of us.
[01:44:54.138 --> 01:44:54.699]  I have a question.
[01:44:54.739 --> 01:44:56.840]  What happens now, now that Soleimani is dead?
[01:44:56.861 --> 01:44:59.763]  I mean, presumably lieutenants will jockey for power.
[01:44:59.843 --> 01:45:00.824]  Is there a worse guy?
[01:45:00.884 --> 01:45:06.148]  Is there a danger that the various groups that he organized will splinter and that chaos will increase?
[01:45:06.448 --> 01:45:08.710]  Sometimes the local tough guy is better than chaos.
[01:45:09.090 --> 01:45:09.971]  I don't know enough about that.
[01:45:09.991 --> 01:45:10.895]  How does this de-escalate?
[01:45:10.915 --> 01:45:13.627]  Because Trump says that and I tend to agree with him, but what's your perspective?
[01:45:15.131 --> 01:45:18.794]  I think that, of course, there's going to be a reaction.
[01:45:19.234 --> 01:45:28.081]  But I refuse to hold President Trump responsible for something, for terrorist attacks that they were going to do anyways.
[01:45:28.381 --> 01:45:32.404]  They have been doing it for 40 years and they're not going to stop anytime soon.
[01:45:32.424 --> 01:45:33.765]  I guess that's my question.
[01:45:34.586 --> 01:45:36.407]  Not so much with respect to Trump.
[01:45:36.447 --> 01:45:38.869]  We'll have an election this year, we'll see which way it goes.
[01:45:39.249 --> 01:45:42.672]  But within Iran itself, who replaces Soleimani?
[01:45:42.972 --> 01:45:43.872]  Will it be one person?
[01:45:43.892 --> 01:45:44.433]  Will it be two?
[01:45:44.453 --> 01:45:45.673]  Will there be a bloody struggle?
[01:45:45.713 --> 01:45:47.794]  Will there be militias that splinter?
[01:45:47.814 --> 01:45:50.575]  Does this increase the likelihood of chaos in the country?
[01:45:50.595 --> 01:45:51.555]  What's your expert take on that?
[01:45:51.615 --> 01:45:53.696]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know anything about the region.
[01:45:54.636 --> 01:45:59.918]  I think the replacement of Soleimani, it's going to be very, very, very tough.
[01:45:59.998 --> 01:46:04.800]  Because Soleimani is a monster, but he was a very, very intelligent monster.
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:10.402]  And he knew how to also communicate very, very well with Sunni militants.
[01:46:11.002 --> 01:46:15.448]  So, the new guy is not someone I'm familiar with at all yet.
[01:46:15.608 --> 01:46:16.189]  I will be.
[01:46:17.190 --> 01:46:19.012]  But I'm still not familiar with.
[01:46:19.332 --> 01:46:25.119]  But I highly doubt that he will be on the same level as Soleimani.
[01:46:25.219 --> 01:46:27.402]  And he's not going to be as charismatic.
[01:46:27.923 --> 01:46:28.603]  Oh, no, no.
[01:46:29.284 --> 01:46:29.725]  He's not.
[01:46:30.165 --> 01:46:30.525]  He's not.
[01:46:30.665 --> 01:46:33.147]  And he's not going to have the same leverage among Sunnis.
[01:46:33.368 --> 01:46:35.649]  Soleimani has a very long history.
[01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:39.673]  He was involved with Ayatollah Khomeini from 1979.
[01:46:40.153 --> 01:46:46.559]  He's got a lot of crimes and bloodshed on his hands that gives him a lot of leverage among Islamist Sunnis and Shiites.
[01:46:46.979 --> 01:46:48.200]  And who is his replacement?
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.061]  What do you know about him?
[01:46:49.141 --> 01:46:50.002]  It's another general.
[01:46:50.082 --> 01:46:52.584]  It's basically his attache.
[01:46:53.505 --> 01:46:59.233]  Yeah, but it's still not, there's not a lot publicly available on him so far, but there will be.
[01:46:59.253 --> 01:47:06.382]  I looked him up, he was the adjunct to him and actually fought with him and trained with him, so it was his right hand man, but he's very secretive and a shadowy figure.
[01:47:08.786 --> 01:47:34.511]  Ma'am, let me ask you this, because you're really what's interesting to understand what's happened in the wider region, and how there was an overthrow, Arab Spring, Obama, and really how that project of the deep state and Obama trying to create the Arab Spring, why they did that in your view, what's coming out of that, how you see Trump's policies actually affecting things, why you do see this as a de-escalation and a pullback, but let me ask you this, is Cynthia
[01:47:36.693 --> 01:47:38.495]  Is your site the best place for people to visit?
[01:47:38.515 --> 01:47:39.897]  Where else can people visit what you do?
[01:47:40.398 --> 01:47:47.247]  Yes, they can find me on my website and also they can follow my work on the website of the Middle East Forum.
[01:47:47.267 --> 01:47:51.172]  And that's where you can find my work.
[01:47:53.103 --> 01:48:05.968]  I want to get into you, because you're even way more interesting than Soleimani and what's currently, because you've been there, you've seen it all, and I know Norm's got some questions as well about free speech in the Middle East, where you see all this going on the other side.
[01:48:06.048 --> 01:48:09.529]  Cynthia Verhout.com, F-A-R-A-H-A-T.
[01:48:09.929 --> 01:48:20.073]  Be sure and bookmark that, because I want her to go and tell you the story of being arrested, what really happened, what Obama financed, and I want to get Norm Pattis' take on that as well, because he's read some books on the subject.
[01:48:20.153 --> 01:48:20.573]  Stay with us.
[01:48:22.659 --> 01:48:31.483]  False Dawn is a book that Norm Pattis, who is a prestigious legal mind, that's not really contested, is currently reading.
[01:48:31.543 --> 01:48:37.085]  So he was excited to hear about Cynthia Farhat coming on, because the Arab Spring was a big deal.
[01:48:37.905 --> 01:48:46.209]  Openly financed by Obama and Google and Facebook to overthrow pro-Western, vastly more Democrat regimes.
[01:48:47.438 --> 01:48:48.138]  In many cases.
[01:48:48.839 --> 01:48:53.101]  And then put in the Muslim Brotherhood that is just the commanders of Al-Qaeda.
[01:48:54.302 --> 01:49:09.150]  And so, Cynthia, if you could just recap, and then get into anything you want, but what you experienced the Arab Spring, the numbers of deaths, hundreds of churches blown up, the Egyptian military being slaughtered, even after the Muslim Brotherhood had control, they wanted to get rid of the officer class.
[01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:11.532]  I mean, your story is incredible.
[01:49:11.852 --> 01:49:14.994]  And then it obviously plugs into what's happening today, and that lens
[01:49:15.936 --> 01:49:23.968]  You look through, as one of the top journalists in Egypt, and now here in the U.S., and how you see Trump now compared to Obama.
[01:49:23.988 --> 01:49:24.789]  Please, you've got the floor.
[01:49:25.717 --> 01:49:27.078]  Oh, there's no comparison.
[01:49:27.098 --> 01:49:41.884]  Right after the protests broke, they wanted me to meet with the Prime Minister, Ahmed Shafiq, and I said no because the protesters did not elect me to represent them.
[01:49:42.584 --> 01:49:50.248]  So, unlike the Egyptian government, I'm not going to hijack a movement that I had nothing to do with.
[01:49:50.848 --> 01:49:53.609]  So, I refused to meet the Prime Minister.
[01:49:53.649 --> 01:49:54.950]  They abducted my brother.
[01:49:55.870 --> 01:50:01.414]  The next day, and I was calling him and the phone opened.
[01:50:01.575 --> 01:50:07.139]  I could hear him, could hear the Mubarak's regime torturing him.
[01:50:07.519 --> 01:50:10.241]  I could hear him scream on the other side.
[01:50:10.901 --> 01:50:19.688]  And after the phone cut off, someone from the regime called me and said, you're going to meet with Ahmad Jafik now and your brother will go back home.
[01:50:19.988 --> 01:50:22.490]  And I still refuse to compromise.
[01:50:23.368 --> 01:50:30.283]  Because I knew that if I showed any weakness or any fear, my brother would get killed.
[01:50:30.744 --> 01:50:32.709]  Because you can't show an...
[01:50:34.245 --> 01:50:44.271]  Iota of fear to these savages who would do something like that to a human being, who would abduct and torture and kill and rape an innocent person.
[01:50:44.652 --> 01:50:48.774]  So they tried to do this, but everything started with 9-11.
[01:50:49.174 --> 01:50:59.421]  After 9-11, I decided that if I'm not part of the solution, I'm part of the terrorist problem and the ideas that are flying into America's buildings, and then I
[01:50:59.921 --> 01:51:07.263]  I studied Islamic theology exactly like a Mufti would study it.
[01:51:07.303 --> 01:51:16.966]  I studied it for 12 years every single day to be able to be in their heads to predict their crimes before they attempt it.
[01:51:17.806 --> 01:51:25.308]  And of course I established also a classic liberal political party that were for separation of mosque and state.
[01:51:26.748 --> 01:51:31.889]  Mubarak's regime didn't like it, of course, and the so-called Arab Spring started.
[01:51:31.909 --> 01:51:40.712]  And by the way, the day President Obama was elected, I told my mother that our life in Egypt was over.
[01:51:41.132 --> 01:51:49.694]  I told her I will either get slaughtered, I will go to prison, or I would have to flee the country.
[01:51:50.354 --> 01:51:51.754]  And it was true.
[01:51:52.195 --> 01:52:00.177]  They tried to assassinate me on October 9, 2011, when I was going to protest for religious freedom with a friend of mine.
[01:52:00.797 --> 01:52:13.060]  Unfortunately, my friend went without me because I had a fever, and he was tortured and killed in front of TV cameras by the military.
[01:52:14.321 --> 01:52:25.387]  And when I escaped the assassination attempt, someone called me and said, from Egyptian intelligence, you escaped this time, but we are still going to get you.
[01:52:25.447 --> 01:52:28.829]  And that's when I took a plane and came to the United States.
[01:52:29.670 --> 01:52:29.970]  Wow.
[01:52:30.130 --> 01:52:30.390]  Wow.
[01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:36.353]  So it was your brother grabbed and your colleagues that were killed.
[01:52:36.393 --> 01:52:37.694]  I mean, just unbelievable.
[01:52:38.414 --> 01:52:39.835]  And you still didn't back down.
[01:52:39.875 --> 01:52:41.516]  You still didn't do what they wanted you to do.
[01:52:43.439 --> 01:52:46.780]  Man, in the media today, wouldn't roll over to that.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:52.343]  So I want you to get into your perspective now of where you see things going with Trump trying to pull out of the Middle East.
[01:52:52.383 --> 01:52:53.563]  But Norm Pattis had a question.
[01:52:53.583 --> 01:52:55.984]  Yeah, I mean, I'm meeting you for the first time, Mr. Fairhead.
[01:52:56.044 --> 01:52:57.065]  It's a very moving story.
[01:52:57.325 --> 01:52:59.025]  Please tell me what happened to your brother.
[01:52:59.466 --> 01:53:00.186]  Is he all right now?
[01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:01.707]  He's fine.
[01:53:02.068 --> 01:53:04.229]  They destroyed his upper jaw.
[01:53:04.269 --> 01:53:07.050]  He had to have three surgeries and a metal gel.
[01:53:07.551 --> 01:53:11.393]  But he's fine and he's a very, very brave man.
[01:53:11.413 --> 01:53:12.794]  Well, as are you, a brave woman.
[01:53:13.034 --> 01:53:17.757]  I've heard stories in recent years at various seminars about the violence toward journalist families.
[01:53:17.777 --> 01:53:24.320]  This is not at all uncommon right now to have a loved one kidnapped and the journalist effectively held hostage that way.
[01:53:24.701 --> 01:53:27.803]  I applaud both you and your brother for your courageous behavior.
[01:53:27.863 --> 01:53:28.243]  Thank you.
[01:53:29.083 --> 01:53:29.704]  Thank you, sir.
[01:53:30.785 --> 01:53:39.247]  Well, I want people to really know what's going on over there and who Obama's backing because, I mean, this happened, correct, after Obama had launched the Arab Spring?
[01:53:40.107 --> 01:53:43.688]  Yes, and this is something that very few people know.
[01:53:44.088 --> 01:53:47.709]  I, you know, I went on WikiLeaks because I was curious.
[01:53:47.769 --> 01:53:53.270]  I wanted to see what was in there about the so-called Arab Spring, and guess what?
[01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:57.151]  The massacre where I was supposed to get executed on October 9, 2011,
[01:54:00.272 --> 01:54:09.348]  Hillary Clinton was aware of it, was aware that it was going to happen, was aware after it happened, and there was discussions about it.
[01:54:10.925 --> 01:54:30.525]  So casually and so irresponsibly talking that nobody cares and the strategy to round Christians and the Islamists will start to kill them and they have a deal with the military to not intervene to try to save their lives.
[01:54:31.326 --> 01:54:35.088]  And Hillary Clinton was aware of this, and she still backed the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:54:35.468 --> 01:54:44.251]  The Obama regime, because that's a regime, not an administration, was aware of this, and they still blamed cops after they were slaughtered on that day.
[01:54:44.751 --> 01:54:49.953]  President Obama came out and said, I urge both sides to restrain themselves.
[01:54:50.254 --> 01:54:50.514]  Who?
[01:54:50.774 --> 01:54:55.075]  The people that were shot execution style, that were run over by military vehicles?
[01:54:55.095 --> 01:54:56.336]  Let me ask you this, why do you think
[01:54:56.756 --> 01:55:02.378]  Obama and Hillary, it's all come out in WikiLeaks, but hell, they were bragging on CNN saying, oh, it's great, they've overthrown the Egyptian government.
[01:55:02.678 --> 01:55:05.939]  These are good people, knowing that it was people far, far worse.
[01:55:06.439 --> 01:55:14.301]  Al Qaeda, ISIS, Muslim Brotherhood, and then exported that into Libya, exported it into Syria, and now the civil war we've seen since then.
[01:55:14.701 --> 01:55:17.962]  Why in the world would Hillary and the deep state want to destabilize the Middle East?
[01:55:17.982 --> 01:55:20.403]  Because they admit, as you said, in the WikiLeaks, that's the plan.
[01:55:20.443 --> 01:55:21.503]  That is such a war crime.
[01:55:24.172 --> 01:55:27.774]  I think President Obama did it for ideological reasons.
[01:55:28.534 --> 01:55:34.557]  Everything he has done from the minute he woke up to the minute he went to sleep was against America, was anti-American.
[01:55:34.958 --> 01:55:45.684]  His speech in 2009 in Cairo was atrocious and it endangered every single Christian and Jew and Yazidi and atheist in the Middle East.
[01:55:46.184 --> 01:55:48.645]  It was one of the most dangerous speeches in history.
[01:55:48.985 --> 01:55:56.568]  We knew after that that this was his signal to Islamists to basically slaughter us.
[01:55:56.908 --> 01:55:57.928]  And we were right.
[01:55:58.068 --> 01:56:02.770]  I told my mom this was going to happen and sadly I was right.
[01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:08.132]  So from your perspective, what's the best and wisest course for America to take in the Middle East?
[01:56:08.252 --> 01:56:27.381]  You know, in the Tim Cook book, which I've just read, I don't know if you've seen it, False Dawn, you know, he suggests that we were crashingly naive in the expectations of the Herb Spring, and that our officious intermittling, or our goodwill, you know, if that's what it was, has done nothing but produce consequences that we can't control.
[01:56:27.701 --> 01:56:31.623]  What should we be doing as a country in the Middle East, or if anything?
[01:56:32.571 --> 01:56:33.672]  Well, we've done before.
[01:56:33.972 --> 01:56:38.395]  The founding fathers had the same exact challenges.
[01:56:38.415 --> 01:56:39.135]  Yeah, they did.
[01:56:39.175 --> 01:56:41.577]  And they fought it marvelously.
[01:56:42.037 --> 01:56:43.678]  Like, I'll give you an example.
[01:56:44.599 --> 01:56:48.221]  The assassination of Soleimani reminded me of a little bit of this.
[01:56:48.641 --> 01:56:53.044]  One of my favorite people in American history is Stephen Decatur.
[01:56:53.544 --> 01:56:56.146]  I have his picture on my wall.
[01:56:57.387 --> 01:56:59.768]  And Stephen Decatur was an American naval hero.
[01:57:01.730 --> 01:57:03.251]  We've got to go to break.
[01:57:03.311 --> 01:57:03.671]  Come back.
[01:57:03.731 --> 01:57:04.612]  I want to hear about this.
[01:57:04.632 --> 01:57:08.095]  I want people to remember what Obama said in Cairo and then what he did.
[01:57:08.536 --> 01:57:14.141]  Turning loose the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda, worldwide and it was done on purpose.
[01:57:14.361 --> 01:57:14.902]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:14.922 --> 01:57:15.302]  Stay with us.
[01:57:17.284 --> 01:57:22.649]  False Dawn is a book that Norm Pattis, who is a prestigious legal mind,
[01:57:23.985 --> 01:57:31.708]  That's not really contested, is currently reading, so he was excited to hear about Cynthia Farhat coming on, because the Arab Spring was a big deal.
[01:57:32.528 --> 01:57:47.693]  Openly financed by Obama and Google and Facebook to overthrow pro-Western, vastly more Democrat regimes, in many cases, and then put in the Muslim Brotherhood that is just the commanders of Al Qaeda.
[01:57:48.929 --> 01:58:13.127]  And so, Cynthia, if you could just recap, and they get into anything you want, but what you experienced the year of spring, the numbers of deaths, hundreds of churches blown up, the Egyptian military being slaughtered, even after the Muslim Brotherhood had control, they wanted to get rid of the officer class, I mean, and how you got imprisoned, and they wanted you to shut up, I mean, your story is incredible, and then it obviously plugs into what's happening today, and that lens
[01:58:14.079 --> 01:58:22.103]  You look through, as one of the top journalists in Egypt, and now here in the U.S., and how you see Trump now compared to Obama.
[01:58:22.123 --> 01:58:22.964]  Please, you've got the floor.
[01:58:23.884 --> 01:58:25.245]  Oh, there's no comparison.
[01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:28.207]  I actually didn't go to prison.
[01:58:28.287 --> 01:58:30.248]  I escaped my assassination attempt.
[01:58:31.028 --> 01:58:32.709]  I was going from memory, because you were on it a year ago.
[01:58:32.729 --> 01:58:36.011]  Didn't you get arrested and grabbed and they tried to make you not say things?
[01:58:37.491 --> 01:58:40.234]  No, they abducted my brother.
[01:58:41.114 --> 01:58:42.175]  That's right.
[01:58:42.295 --> 01:58:44.357]  Yeah, they took my brother, not me.
[01:58:44.377 --> 01:58:49.982]  I just remember they grabbed somebody, tried to make you... It was in the news they did that.
[01:58:50.822 --> 01:58:51.103]  Yes.
[01:58:51.303 --> 01:58:53.385]  I apologize, my memory fails.
[01:58:53.905 --> 01:58:57.148]  They abducted your brother to get you to stop doing what you do.
[01:58:57.568 --> 01:58:58.449]  Yes, to get me.
[01:58:58.889 --> 01:59:05.855]  Right after the protests broke, they wanted me to meet with the Prime Minister, Ahmed Shafiq.
[01:59:06.555 --> 01:59:13.263]  And I said no because the protesters did not elect me to represent them.
[01:59:13.944 --> 01:59:21.612]  So unlike the Egyptian government, I'm not going to hijack a movement that I had nothing to do with.
[01:59:22.213 --> 01:59:24.996]  So I refused to meet the Prime Minister.
[01:59:25.036 --> 01:59:26.318]  They abducted my brother.
[01:59:27.238 --> 01:59:32.782]  The next day, and I was calling him and the phone opened.
[01:59:32.942 --> 01:59:38.525]  I could hear him, could hear the Mubarak's regime torturing him.
[01:59:38.886 --> 01:59:41.607]  I could hear him scream on the other side.
[01:59:42.268 --> 01:59:51.053]  And after the phone cut off, someone from the regime called me and said, you're going to meet with Ahmed Shafiq now and your brother will go back home.
[01:59:51.353 --> 01:59:53.855]  And I still refuse to compromise.
[01:59:54.753 --> 02:00:01.648]  Because I knew that if I showed any weakness or any fear, my brother would get killed.
[02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:03.973]  Because you can't show...
[02:00:05.630 --> 02:00:15.636]  Iota of fear to these savages who would do something like that to a human being who would abduct and torture and kill and rape an innocent person.
[02:00:16.037 --> 02:00:20.139]  So they tried to do this, but everything started with 9-11.
[02:00:20.539 --> 02:00:30.786]  After 9-11, I decided that if I'm not part of the solution, I'm part of the terrorist problem and the ideas that are flying into America's buildings, and then I
[02:00:31.446 --> 02:00:38.630]  I studied Islamic theology exactly like a Mufti would study it.
[02:00:38.670 --> 02:00:44.353]  I studied it for 12 years every single day to be able to be in their heads to predict
[02:00:45.097 --> 02:01:03.207]  Their crimes before they attempted and that and of course I established also a classic liberal political party that were for separation of mosque and state and Mubarak's regime didn't like it of course and the so-called Arab Spring started
[02:01:03.827 --> 02:01:12.072]  And, by the way, the day President Obama was elected, I told my mother that our life in Egypt was over.
[02:01:12.512 --> 02:01:21.277]  I told her I will either get slaughtered, I will go to prison, or I would have to flee the country.
[02:01:21.737 --> 02:01:23.118]  And it was true.
[02:01:23.578 --> 02:01:31.523]  They tried to assassinate me on October 9, 2011, when I was going to protest for religious freedom with a friend of mine.
[02:01:32.163 --> 02:01:44.470]  Unfortunately, my friend went without me because I had a fever and he was tortured and killed in front of TV cameras by the military.
[02:01:44.490 --> 02:01:56.778]  And when I escaped the assassination attempt, someone called me and said, from Egyptian intelligence, you escaped this time, but we are still going to get you.
[02:01:56.838 --> 02:02:00.180]  And that's when I took a plane and came to the United States.
[02:02:01.021 --> 02:02:01.762]  Wow, wow.
[02:02:01.843 --> 02:02:07.693]  So it was your brother grabbed and your colleagues that were killed.
[02:02:07.753 --> 02:02:09.055]  I mean, just unbelievable.
[02:02:09.777 --> 02:02:11.219]  And you still didn't back down.
[02:02:11.259 --> 02:02:12.902]  You still didn't do what they wanted you to do.
[02:02:14.804 --> 02:02:18.146]  Man, in the media today, wouldn't roll over to that.
[02:02:18.186 --> 02:02:23.728]  So I want you to get into your perspective now of where you see things going with Trump trying to pull out of the Middle East.
[02:02:23.748 --> 02:02:24.929]  But Norm Pattis had a question.
[02:02:24.949 --> 02:02:27.350]  Yeah, I mean, I'm meeting you for the first time, Mr. Fairhead.
[02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:28.430]  It's a very moving story.
[02:02:28.691 --> 02:02:30.411]  Please tell me what happened to your brother.
[02:02:30.852 --> 02:02:31.552]  Is he all right now?
[02:02:32.492 --> 02:02:33.072]  He's fine.
[02:02:33.432 --> 02:02:35.593]  They destroyed his upper jaw.
[02:02:35.633 --> 02:02:38.434]  He had to have three surgeries and a metal gel.
[02:02:38.914 --> 02:02:42.775]  But he's fine and he's a very, very brave man.
[02:02:42.795 --> 02:02:44.156]  I'm sorry, are you a brave woman?
[02:02:44.416 --> 02:02:49.118]  I've heard stories in recent years at various seminars about the violence toward journalist families.
[02:02:49.138 --> 02:02:55.660]  This is not at all uncommon right now to have a loved one kidnapped and the journalist effectively held hostage that way.
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:59.161]  I applaud both you and your brother for your courageous behavior.
[02:02:59.221 --> 02:02:59.561]  Thank you.
[02:03:00.418 --> 02:03:01.139]  Thank you, sir.
[02:03:11.491 --> 02:03:15.052]  Yes, and this is something that very few people know.
[02:03:15.452 --> 02:03:19.073]  I went on WikiLeaks because I was curious.
[02:03:19.133 --> 02:03:23.434]  I wanted to see what was in there about the so-called Arab Spring.
[02:03:23.834 --> 02:03:24.634]  And guess what?
[02:03:25.195 --> 02:03:28.515]  The massacre where I was supposed to get executed on October 9, 2011,
[02:03:31.657 --> 02:03:40.712]  Hillary Clinton was aware of it, was aware that it was going to happen, was aware after it happened, and there was discussions about it.
[02:03:42.290 --> 02:04:01.910]  So casually and so irresponsibly talking that nobody cares and the strategy to round Christians and the Islamists will start to kill them and they have a deal with the military to not intervene to try to save their lives.
[02:04:02.708 --> 02:04:06.470]  And Hillary Clinton was aware of this, and she still backed the Muslim Brotherhood.

[02:04:16.133 --> 02:04:21.335]  President Obama came out and said, I urge both sides to restrain themselves.
[02:04:21.636 --> 02:04:21.876]  Who?
[02:04:22.136 --> 02:04:26.377]  The people that were shot execution style, that were run over by military vehicles?
[02:04:26.397 --> 02:04:27.718]  Let me ask you this, why do you think
[02:04:28.138 --> 02:04:33.761]  Obama and Hillary, it's all come out in WikiLeaks, but hell, they were bragging on CNN saying, oh, it's great, they've overthrown the Egyptian government.
[02:04:34.061 --> 02:04:37.323]  These are good people, knowing that it was people far, far worse.
[02:04:37.803 --> 02:04:45.667]  Al Qaeda, ISIS, Muslim Brotherhood, and that then exported that into Libya, exported it into Syria, and now the civil war we've seen since then.
[02:04:46.087 --> 02:04:49.329]  Why in the world would Hillary and the deep state want to destabilize the Middle East?
[02:04:49.349 --> 02:04:51.770]  Because they admit, as you said, in the WikiLeaks, that's the plan.

[02:06:03.936 --> 02:06:09.760]  What we've done before, the founding fathers had the same exact challenges.
[02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:10.360]  Yeah, they did.
[02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:12.942]  And they fought it marvelously.
[02:06:13.402 --> 02:06:15.063]  Like, I'll give you an example.
[02:06:15.964 --> 02:06:19.586]  The assassination of Soleimani reminded me of a little bit of this.

[02:06:34.676 --> 02:06:35.036]  Come back.
[02:06:35.096 --> 02:06:35.977]  I want to hear about this.
[02:06:35.997 --> 02:06:39.461]  I want people to remember what Obama said in Cairo and then what he did.
[02:06:39.901 --> 02:06:45.527]  Turning loose the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaeda, worldwide and it was done on purpose.
[02:06:45.747 --> 02:06:46.267]  We'll be right back.
[02:06:46.287 --> 02:06:46.648]  Stay with us.
[02:06:48.996 --> 02:06:52.818]  It's great to have a live TV radio show that reaches millions of people conservatively a day.
[02:06:53.038 --> 02:06:55.839]  It's all because the listeners keep spreading the word and that gets past the censors.
[02:06:55.899 --> 02:07:06.423]  But one of my biggest frustrations is there's so much huge breaking news and so much of what we're covering is so important that I knew about this this morning before the show.
[02:07:06.443 --> 02:07:10.945]  I saw the documents, the clips, everything, and then I just did.
[02:07:12.844 --> 02:07:19.467]  Two hours and 47 minutes of live media and didn't tell people, oh, I'm going to go live a little bit in the fourth hour.
[02:07:20.888 --> 02:07:27.092]  And then Dr. Nick Begich takes over to break what was given to us by vaccine damage researchers.
[02:07:28.332 --> 02:07:30.333]  That is smoking gun stuff.
[02:07:31.794 --> 02:07:36.997]  So Rob Dew is going to be joining me for that segment from six after to 15 after.
[02:07:39.929 --> 02:07:54.934]  Coming up next hour, where the head UN scientist says vaccines are totally safe and effective, and then she's caught on internal video in a board meeting saying, we don't have the data.
[02:07:54.954 --> 02:07:56.154]  In fact, this could be hurting people.
[02:07:56.574 --> 02:07:58.895]  In fact, before I forget, print me these articles from 2020.
[02:07:58.955 --> 02:08:02.336]  Did an ABC report back in 2002.
[02:08:02.376 --> 02:08:03.317]  You'll find it online.
[02:08:06.235 --> 02:08:09.339]  Or just CDC had covered up autism brain damage risk.
[02:08:09.619 --> 02:08:14.304]  And it's the head of the CDC in a meeting and the minutes came out in a lawsuit saying, my God, we brain damaged millions.
[02:08:14.324 --> 02:08:15.265]  We got to cover this up.
[02:08:15.766 --> 02:08:18.749]  So again, I'm not against vaccines themselves as a technology.
[02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:23.174]  It's that the liability protection, what the companies are doing is the big problem.
[02:08:23.214 --> 02:08:25.156]  My grandmother got polio, polio vaccine.
[02:08:25.176 --> 02:08:25.876]  They told her that.
[02:08:26.517 --> 02:08:28.858]  Okay, so we'll get to that next hour.
[02:08:28.878 --> 02:08:30.239]  Norm Pettis riding shotgun.
[02:08:30.879 --> 02:08:36.643]  You had a question for our guest here because you've been going to seminars about law.
[02:08:36.663 --> 02:08:38.664]  You were just at one about free speech, the Middle East.
[02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:41.125]  I mean, you're a bookworm.
[02:08:41.145 --> 02:08:43.046]  You're a smart guy, Norm Pettis.
[02:08:43.166 --> 02:08:52.692]  And we've got Cynthia, one of the most famous journalists over there, whose brother got kidnapped and tortured and put in jail, and her colleagues who were tortured and killed.
[02:08:54.210 --> 02:08:57.411]  Saying, we're going to do this to you if you don't recant and work for us.
[02:08:57.451 --> 02:08:58.151]  Well, she didn't.
[02:08:58.431 --> 02:09:00.031]  I mean, that's a hero right there, Norm.
[02:09:00.591 --> 02:09:01.171]  It certainly is.
[02:09:01.471 --> 02:09:01.951]  I was stunned.
[02:09:01.992 --> 02:09:02.832]  I attended a conference.
[02:09:02.872 --> 02:09:04.432]  I wish, I'm ashamed to say, I don't remember the name.
[02:09:04.472 --> 02:09:05.172]  You may know it.
[02:09:05.192 --> 02:09:14.634]  He said a barrister in London, a young woman in her 40s, who's represented a number of Middle East journalists whose families have been abducted while the journalists were in Great Britain.
[02:09:15.494 --> 02:09:20.095]  And they are held often in circumstance as much as your brother was.
[02:09:20.695 --> 02:09:21.777]  Some of them have been killed.
[02:09:22.678 --> 02:09:24.001]  I was totally amazed.
[02:09:24.061 --> 02:09:25.323]  Somehow I had missed this.
[02:09:25.343 --> 02:09:28.588]  Because our media doesn't make a big deal about this because usually it's people working for Obama.
[02:09:28.868 --> 02:09:29.709]  No, apparently not.
[02:09:29.749 --> 02:09:31.833]  I mean, how common a problem is this?
[02:09:31.893 --> 02:09:34.637]  How many of your colleagues have been similarly terrorized?
[02:09:36.124 --> 02:09:37.365]  I lost count.
[02:09:37.465 --> 02:09:49.614]  I lost count of how many people were imprisoned and tortured and abducted and raped and thrown in the desert, blindfolded, thrown in the river and thrown in the Nile.
[02:09:49.654 --> 02:09:50.735]  How have you survived?
[02:09:50.775 --> 02:09:53.417]  Here you are looking like you're pretty healthy to me.
[02:09:53.697 --> 02:09:55.338]  She fled to the U.S.
[02:09:55.518 --> 02:09:56.579]  Are you afraid to go home?
[02:09:56.599 --> 02:10:00.062]  Do you have family at home that are used as leverage against you at this point?
[02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:06.243]  No, all my family is here right now and they're very, very safe and happy in America.
[02:10:07.203 --> 02:10:14.926]  I stayed alive because I know how they think and I knew how to always be one step ahead of them.
[02:10:15.567 --> 02:10:18.988]  I knew how to have leverage when I didn't have any.
[02:10:19.008 --> 02:10:21.069]  What was the assassination attempt?
[02:10:21.089 --> 02:10:22.130]  Did you know it was coming?
[02:10:22.170 --> 02:10:23.270]  What happened?
[02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:28.512]  It came out when she was going to go to this public event where they did kill a bunch of people and she didn't go.
[02:10:28.592 --> 02:10:28.793]  Wow.
[02:10:28.893 --> 02:10:29.653]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:31.274 --> 02:10:38.679]  The person I was going with got killed execution style after he was run over by a military vehicle.
[02:10:38.719 --> 02:10:44.523]  And the same day, someone from Egyptian intelligence said, we missed you today, but we are going to get you.
[02:10:44.944 --> 02:10:56.532]  And although I've been getting 10 to 50 death threats a day for a decade and I was under surveillance, I knew that this time they were serious because they did it to Michael so they could do it to me.
[02:10:57.478 --> 02:11:01.820]  Um, and that's when I really truly believed that they were serious.
[02:11:16.351 --> 02:11:23.715]  You're really an expert on someone that's read the Quran, that's read the different books that go along with it, and that really knows what's going on.
[02:11:23.755 --> 02:11:29.478]  We should have you back on just to get into that research and where Orthodox Islam's going.
[02:11:30.078 --> 02:11:35.961]  But just in summation, because I want people to really know what you've personally gone through to get a snapshot of this, what's really going on with Islam?
[02:11:36.061 --> 02:11:41.244]  What do you think the average viewer and listener should know about what's happening in Europe, what's happening in the Middle East?
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:48.564]  So there's some pretty good news, which is very unusual coming out of the Middle East.
[02:11:48.644 --> 02:11:51.625]  I personally did not see that coming at all.
[02:11:53.086 --> 02:12:04.533]  If someone had told me a decade ago that I will be seeing what I'm witnessing right now happening in the Middle East, I would have thought that they were deranged or high or something.
[02:12:05.013 --> 02:12:08.135]  But I would have never believed it in a million years.
[02:12:08.595 --> 02:12:10.296]  But I'm seeing it with my own eyes.
[02:12:10.316 --> 02:12:15.579]  There's a huge reformist movement going on right now for separation of mosque and state.
[02:12:16.239 --> 02:12:19.341]  And we have very powerful politicians on our side.
[02:12:20.501 --> 02:12:33.028]  President Sisi, his administration has tons of problems and he still has a lot of the bureaucracy and the deep state and very similar problems that President Trump is dealing with.
[02:12:33.508 --> 02:12:41.332]  But he is 100% on the side of reformers and he is absolutely not shy about it.
[02:12:41.412 --> 02:12:50.416]  I published an article that shows historic, unprecedented things that President Sisi did.
[02:12:50.436 --> 02:12:53.017]  I published it in Middle East Quarterly.
[02:12:53.057 --> 02:12:57.459]  You can find it on my website and you can find it on the Middle East Forum's website.
[02:12:58.206 --> 02:13:00.087]  And I did not see that coming at all.
[02:13:00.147 --> 02:13:08.732]  I was very skeptical when Cece came to power and I wrote articles against him and I had every right to be skeptical because he came out of military intelligence.
[02:13:09.333 --> 02:13:12.555]  So I thought he was just going to be more of the same.
[02:13:13.235 --> 02:13:17.798]  Until he started to do the exact opposite of what I thought he would do.
[02:13:17.818 --> 02:13:19.019]  Can I ask you this question?
[02:13:19.039 --> 02:13:27.384]  I mean, Trump says, and what I heard in the military intelligence people, they say he's trying this and some of the policy wonks, he really is trying to have a pragmatic thing of
[02:13:27.944 --> 02:13:36.629]  No destabilization, no stirring up Shunis and Shiites for control just so we can have weapon sales in the area or just so we can, you know, have no big contractors.
[02:13:36.649 --> 02:13:42.992]  Then he's really trying to kill the agenda that's been going on for multiple generations to stir the Middle East up and destabilize it.
[02:13:43.052 --> 02:13:53.838]  Are you, as a real scholar, thinking that you're seeing some of what Trump's doing, telegraphing that to the Middle East and then bolstering even people you thought would be bad are now getting with the program?
[02:13:55.322 --> 02:13:55.342]  I
[02:14:11.231 --> 02:14:16.816]  To their understanding that he does not put up with radical Islamic agenda.
[02:14:17.216 --> 02:14:20.839]  He is not shy to speak his mind against these forces.
[02:14:20.879 --> 02:14:22.680]  Radical Islam is not popular.
[02:14:23.041 --> 02:14:25.242]  It's just that they're in power and everyone's scared.
[02:14:25.543 --> 02:14:29.686]  So Trump's helping people in the Middle East have courage, is what you're saying.
[02:14:30.675 --> 02:14:39.742]  Absolutely, just like the Iranians are happy, most of the Iranians, 90% I would dare say of the Iranians are happy that the monster Soleimani is dead.
[02:14:40.603 --> 02:14:54.154]  The United States of America fought against Islamic terrorism before during the Barbary Wars, which you call Barbary Wars, in our history they're called Jihadist expeditions against the infidels.
[02:14:54.754 --> 02:14:58.375]  So, uh, the Barbary Wars, look how they were fought.
[02:14:58.755 --> 02:15:05.377]  There's something that I always, always say, because this should be the slogan for foreign policy.
[02:15:05.397 --> 02:15:06.237]  Cynthia, can we do this?
[02:15:06.317 --> 02:15:09.998]  Because, because I was all over the map today, you did a great, powerful interview, and Norm was here and asked some great questions.
[02:15:10.258 --> 02:15:12.939]  Will you come back next week for an hour and get into the Barbary Wars?
[02:15:13.219 --> 02:15:21.961]  And then maybe come on in a month later and talk about, yeah, because I know you know your history, I know it too, but you know way more than I do, and it's just, exactly, Barbary Wars, um,
[02:15:22.501 --> 02:15:27.904]  Of course we have the President, Thomas Jefferson, you know, going to war, the Leathernecks, the Marines.
[02:15:27.924 --> 02:15:46.392]  I would propose a broader project for you, Cynthia, and that is teach people like me, ordinary Americans who have acquired a smidgen of Islamophobia and have to feel ashamed when they meet a Muslim person, handshake to handshake, and realize they're the same, teach us how to coexist and teach us more about the separation of mosque and state.
[02:15:46.832 --> 02:15:48.153]  How can we have it the same?
[02:15:48.173 --> 02:15:49.593]  How do we have a reformation for Islam?
[02:15:49.613 --> 02:15:50.614]  Would you come on and talk about that?
[02:15:50.854 --> 02:15:53.697]  And how can we have a reformation in American attitudes to get it right?
[02:15:53.717 --> 02:15:57.020]  Because it's one planet and we've got to find a way to live together or we're going to die together.
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:58.041]  Is that a good idea, Cynthia?
[02:15:58.061 --> 02:16:00.544]  That sounds fantastic.
[02:16:00.644 --> 02:16:04.828]  And I'm writing a book right now which will have a lot of this information.
[02:16:05.088 --> 02:16:05.789]  Send me a copy.
[02:16:06.049 --> 02:16:06.509]  I will.
[02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:07.610]  He owns a bookstore.
[02:16:07.691 --> 02:16:08.892]  Please join us again next week.
[02:16:09.272 --> 02:16:11.454]  Of course, the website is CynthiaFarhat.com.
[02:16:11.494 --> 02:16:12.035]  God bless you.
[02:16:13.359 --> 02:16:14.319]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:15.560]  Thank you for having me.
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:16.240]  Thank you.
[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:19.202]  The last time she's been on, she's been on a couple times and I've seen her on other shows.
[02:16:19.222 --> 02:16:21.062]  I mean, she's just an incredible historian.
[02:16:21.082 --> 02:16:22.363]  That's why I want to start getting her on more.
[02:16:22.403 --> 02:16:25.024]  But talking about her story, it's so wild.
[02:16:25.044 --> 02:16:26.985]  Yeah, I didn't mean to divert things.
[02:16:27.105 --> 02:16:29.186]  I never met her before and I was like amazed.
[02:16:29.206 --> 02:16:30.407]  Listen, you kicked ass.
[02:16:30.447 --> 02:16:33.428]  And what it's all about is getting these really interesting guests on that lived a lot.
[02:16:33.488 --> 02:16:34.348]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:16:34.408 --> 02:16:35.469]  And she's really famous in the Middle East.
[02:16:35.529 --> 02:16:40.391]  What's funny, when I was attending that seminar and hearing about how these family members are getting abducted, I'm like, really?
[02:16:40.471 --> 02:16:41.412]  And then here she is.
[02:16:41.472 --> 02:16:42.112]  Here's one of them.
[02:16:42.392 --> 02:16:45.194]  Well, this is why you can't have freedom over there, is the radicals are in control.
[02:16:45.214 --> 02:16:48.996]  But if we show strength against that, these folks want... Oh yeah, I'm all on that.
[02:16:49.016 --> 02:16:53.198]  They want freedom, and that doesn't mean teaching five-year-olds how to cut their genitals off, you know.
[02:16:53.218 --> 02:16:55.779]  And there's some of that radical Islam, we need that conservatism.
[02:16:56.700 --> 02:17:00.101]  Compared to the left, I think some of the radical Islamists are the lesser of evils.
[02:17:00.121 --> 02:17:02.943]  But let's finish up with five minutes, then I've got the huge U.N.
[02:17:02.983 --> 02:17:04.244]  news and the Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:17:04.264 --> 02:17:05.364]  But believe me, this U.N.
[02:17:05.384 --> 02:17:06.645]  vaccine news is huge.
[02:17:08.194 --> 02:17:11.817]  It's like Norm Pettis, famous constitutional lawyers, reading my mind.
[02:17:11.957 --> 02:17:22.566]  Because I wanted to ask him weeks ago during the whole impeachment fiasco to come on, and then he was busy with cases and couldn't at that time, about impeachment.
[02:17:23.715 --> 02:17:32.360]  And about as a constitutional lawyer who practices federal and state, what is it like to watch what they did with due process?
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:38.683]  And was Jonathan Turley, who's a liberal professor, right when he says what was impeachable is how the Democrats have conducted this?
[02:17:38.743 --> 02:17:41.044]  And how do they even have a trial in the Senate now when the
[02:17:42.335 --> 02:17:44.497]  Fruit of the tree is from a poison tree.
[02:17:45.438 --> 02:17:46.398]  We've got four minutes left.
[02:17:46.458 --> 02:17:49.801]  What is your expert view on this, what I call a fiasco?
[02:17:50.402 --> 02:17:51.502]  It is a fiasco.
[02:17:51.563 --> 02:18:01.991]  I mean, I think the thing that's been frustrating to me watching the coverage is this is not a traditional legal proceeding, and thus the rules of evidence and the rules of criminal and or civil procedure don't apply.
[02:18:02.351 --> 02:18:06.415]  But what we're tinkering with is the soul of the nation and how we govern ourselves.
[02:18:06.475 --> 02:18:09.017]  And there's an attack on the highest office in the land.
[02:18:09.457 --> 02:18:14.580]  And in the past they would try to follow impeachments according to parliamentary rules, right?
[02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:15.640]  They'd have rules.
[02:18:16.161 --> 02:18:21.824]  But what we have here is a failure to communicate, to quote Cool Hand Luke.
[02:18:21.884 --> 02:18:27.446]  Nobody has persuaded me that anything involving Ukraine really affects national security.
[02:18:27.807 --> 02:18:29.928]  And Nancy Pelosi called her own bluff.
[02:18:30.588 --> 02:18:32.109]  She's the one that should be impeached.
[02:18:32.609 --> 02:18:35.211]  This is an urgent matter of national security.
[02:18:35.251 --> 02:18:40.015]  We've got to rush through the proceedings in order to get this done because presumably we're at risk.
[02:18:40.376 --> 02:18:45.540]  And then, oh by the way, I'm not going to send the articles over because I don't like the way the trial is going to look.
[02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:49.984]  I thought we were at risk and this had to get done because Washington was burning.
[02:18:50.504 --> 02:18:57.546]  Now, the other thing that seemed to get lost is, okay, Trump asked for whatever he asked for from the Ukraine investigation of Biden.
[02:18:57.766 --> 02:19:07.028]  I still want to know, as an American citizen, how Joe Biden's 30-something-year-old kid got a $50,000-a-month do-nothing job on a Ukrainian board.
[02:19:07.428 --> 02:19:11.189]  If he didn't get it because Papa pulled the strings, I don't have hair down my shoulders.
[02:19:11.609 --> 02:19:14.110]  So, from my perspective, that's an unanswered question.
[02:19:14.130 --> 02:19:17.231]  The Republicans have missed the opportunity to focus on bread and butter.
[02:19:17.711 --> 02:19:33.460]  Nancy Pelosi's claim that some, and the case has not been made to me, that whatever manipulation was done with respect to the aid was of such vital national security interest that we need to unseat the highest elected official on the land.
[02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:34.840]  The case has not been made.
[02:19:35.701 --> 02:19:39.663]  And when Nancy doesn't send it, when Pelosi doesn't send it to the Senate,
[02:19:40.123 --> 02:19:42.745]  I think, you know, I heard an interesting suggestion the other day.
[02:19:42.845 --> 02:19:47.928]  One senator thought of moving to dismiss on the theory that the House hadn't diligently prosecuted.
[02:19:48.348 --> 02:19:50.269]  I think that's a viable option at this point.
[02:19:50.349 --> 02:19:51.370]  It's a political stunt.
[02:19:51.730 --> 02:19:55.812]  As far as I'm concerned, she's holding on to the... Yeah, you shouldn't even dignify it with a trial.
[02:19:55.832 --> 02:19:58.794]  I know Trump likes it because he thinks it'll, you know, let him show other frauds.
[02:19:58.854 --> 02:20:05.878]  But, I mean, if you start dignifying total frauds, I think you... Because they're talking about having new impeachments and new articles and it's just, it'll go on and on.
[02:20:06.078 --> 02:20:11.926]  They'll churn it until the election, and I think the impeachment process becomes publicly funded Democratic campaign fodder.
[02:20:12.466 --> 02:20:18.294]  That's why she's sitting on the indictment, so to speak, or the impeachment process, because the timing isn't right.
[02:20:18.815 --> 02:20:24.242]  But once the primaries begin and the Democratic field shakes itself out a little bit more,
[02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:34.746]  I think those articles will go over and then we will be paying, we the people, will be paying the Senate to produce Democratic talking points as part of the 2020 election.
[02:20:34.787 --> 02:20:36.347]  I think most people are sure of it.
[02:20:36.367 --> 02:20:40.269]  Senator Graham says they might get it going sometime next week, but who knows?
[02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:44.191]  It's just unprecedented, as you said, to hold the country hostage like this.
[02:20:44.211 --> 02:20:45.831]  And I think it really hurt them bad.
[02:20:45.851 --> 02:20:54.075]  You know, just because 14 percent of Americans in a major poll think brown cows produce chocolate milk doesn't mean the rest of us don't see through how dangerous this is.
[02:20:54.335 --> 02:20:56.816]  I still want to find that pink cow for the strawberry milk.
[02:20:57.636 --> 02:20:59.737]  You know, they have orange juliennes.
[02:21:00.798 --> 02:21:02.118]  Orange cows and orange milk.
[02:21:02.279 --> 02:21:02.999]  I've missed those.
[02:21:03.039 --> 02:21:05.720]  I've been traveling a little bit lately, but I've missed the orange cows.
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:11.262]  Well, in the minute we have left, it's still in the Supreme Court of Connecticut.
[02:21:12.003 --> 02:21:12.923]  And the left's all excited.
[02:21:13.003 --> 02:21:14.104]  Oh, we've got Alex Jones.
[02:21:14.724 --> 02:21:16.645]  His case is in the Supreme Court.
[02:21:16.665 --> 02:21:18.366]  He's been found guilty of the Sandy Hook stuff.
[02:21:18.746 --> 02:21:23.768]  No, no, it's a special appeal because of what was going on before anything ever got going.
[02:21:24.068 --> 02:21:31.895]  The appeal was that the court violated your First Amendment rights by penalizing you for speaking out on this show.
[02:21:32.236 --> 02:21:33.377]  That's what the appeal is.
[02:21:33.437 --> 02:21:37.060]  And the question is, could you be punished for vigorous expression?
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:38.141]  Our answer is no.
[02:21:38.481 --> 02:21:41.044]  If the Connecticut Supreme Court says you can, we'll go to the U.S.
[02:21:41.084 --> 02:21:42.405]  Supreme Court to see what they think.
[02:21:45.973 --> 02:21:47.595]  It's just unprecedented what's happening.
[02:21:47.615 --> 02:21:49.337]  Norm Patus, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:21:49.357 --> 02:21:49.777]  Really appreciate it.
[02:21:49.797 --> 02:21:50.338]  Thanks for having me.
[02:21:50.358 --> 02:21:51.119]  You did a great job today.
[02:21:51.259 --> 02:21:56.065]  Alright, the huge, I mean this is life-saving, critical information on the other side.
[02:21:59.378 --> 02:22:00.359]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[02:22:00.419 --> 02:22:01.740]  You're going to finish up with these calls.
[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:06.084]  And then Greg Reese and, of course, Harrison Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[02:22:06.124 --> 02:22:07.465]  The crew's volunteered to do it.
[02:22:07.706 --> 02:22:10.788]  So we're here live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[02:22:11.149 --> 02:22:12.370]  So the live coverage continues.
[02:22:12.410 --> 02:22:13.471]  Everybody spread those links.
[02:22:13.751 --> 02:22:16.053]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[02:22:16.093 --> 02:22:16.694]  Don't let them win.
[02:22:16.834 --> 02:22:17.174]  No BS.
[02:22:17.194 --> 02:22:19.356]  Let me tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[02:22:19.556 --> 02:22:21.298]  See, I don't have some Machiavelli manipulative view.
[02:22:21.999 --> 02:22:24.201]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[02:22:24.241 --> 02:22:25.382]  That's the real power!
[02:22:27.930 --> 02:22:32.473]  You have to do every single thing I say or we will not make it.
[02:22:32.854 --> 02:22:33.474]  Understand?
[02:22:33.794 --> 02:22:34.815]  Do you understand?
[02:22:35.496 --> 02:22:36.536]  Come with me if you want to live.
[02:22:37.157 --> 02:22:38.338]  Come with me if you want to live.
[02:22:46.684 --> 02:22:50.547]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Friday Worldwide Broadcast.
[02:22:51.307 --> 02:22:55.751]  And we've got the InfoWars Nightly News and News Director Rob Dew here with us in
[02:22:57.352 --> 02:23:04.593]  He was showing me this information this morning that was sent to us by some of the researchers out there and it just blew me away.
[02:23:05.334 --> 02:23:11.915]  And so we're going to do a detailed report on this that should be done by next Monday or Tuesday.
[02:23:11.955 --> 02:23:24.697]  But I wanted to go ahead and just give some background here and then get to this with Rob because this is the World Health Organization chief scientist caught lying to the public.
[02:23:25.836 --> 02:23:31.000]  And so he'll go over some of this, but here she is in an internal video that they didn't want released.
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:33.382]  This is leaked right now, here.
[02:23:34.242 --> 02:23:36.784]  And she's saying, we haven't tested these.
[02:23:36.824 --> 02:23:39.686]  We don't know if what people are saying is true, that it's killing people.
[02:23:40.387 --> 02:23:42.849]  Well, that's because there's liability protection here in the U.S.
[02:23:43.069 --> 02:23:43.929]  and in other countries.
[02:23:43.969 --> 02:23:46.651]  They get the same laws passed where you can't know what's in them.
[02:23:47.867 --> 02:23:53.872]  And you can't know what they're contaminated with, and if somebody gets hurt, they secretly go to a secret court and then maybe get paid off.
[02:23:54.713 --> 02:23:56.834]  So, safe and effective, that's a lie.
[02:23:56.894 --> 02:24:00.817]  Now they're trying to pass laws that take the inserts out where it admits it can hurt you or kill you.
[02:24:01.238 --> 02:24:04.661]  They always misrepresent and say we're against the technology of vaccines.
[02:24:04.841 --> 02:24:10.165]  No, they have liability protection, big corrupt, big pharma, all the history of their problems.
[02:24:10.265 --> 02:24:13.327]  What drug company should be exempt from liability for any
[02:24:14.268 --> 02:24:15.068]  of its products.
[02:24:15.128 --> 02:24:16.349]  This is madness.
[02:24:16.669 --> 02:24:21.731]  Now they have thousands of vaccines in development, over 500 approved in different parts of the world.
[02:24:22.251 --> 02:24:24.472]  They're trying to make you take more and more of this.
[02:24:24.592 --> 02:24:36.296]  Companies are going to make you pay for something, in many cases that's experimental, because the governor says he thinks it's an emergency, like Gardasil, supposedly going to stop the
[02:24:37.893 --> 02:24:39.674]  Warts that certain viruses cause.
[02:24:39.854 --> 02:24:40.995]  A wart is cancer, folks.
[02:24:41.655 --> 02:24:44.917]  And then it kills a bunch of people, but it's okay because they have liability protection.
[02:24:45.237 --> 02:24:48.059]  They go and get a president or a governor under U.S.
[02:24:48.099 --> 02:24:50.620]  law to say, this is an emergency, take it.
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:53.222]  It gives it liability protection and it's added to that list.
[02:24:53.262 --> 02:25:00.426]  And then they can dump it on the market knowing Gardasil killed all those people on record and hurt so many others and sterilizes a lot of women.
[02:25:00.866 --> 02:25:02.067]  They're using it in the third world.
[02:25:02.127 --> 02:25:03.968]  So there's so many cases of this.
[02:25:05.353 --> 02:25:07.215]  Rob, dude, this is just massive.
[02:25:07.255 --> 02:25:09.497]  This video was from December 3rd.
[02:25:10.057 --> 02:25:11.599]  This just got leaked to us.
[02:25:11.639 --> 02:25:14.141]  This isn't even out there from the activists we've talked to.
[02:25:14.422 --> 02:25:16.063]  This report's just now coming out here.
[02:25:16.363 --> 02:25:18.145]  We want to talk about who those activists are and more.
[02:25:18.445 --> 02:25:20.047]  And again, I want to do justice to what they're doing.
[02:25:20.067 --> 02:25:21.068]  We'll do a whole report.
[02:25:21.468 --> 02:25:22.449]  It's out sometime next week.
[02:25:22.489 --> 02:25:24.211]  We'll get an article up today with this video.
[02:25:24.471 --> 02:25:26.333]  This is really, and people need to know this.
[02:25:26.513 --> 02:25:27.754]  And let me explain what you're going to see.
[02:25:28.114 --> 02:25:31.796]  What starts off in this video is this Soumya Swamathan.
[02:25:31.936 --> 02:25:34.978]  She's head chief scientist at the UN, the WHO.
[02:25:35.378 --> 02:25:39.301]  And she's talking about how vaccines are safe and effective and they do all this great stuff and oh, they're great.
[02:25:39.561 --> 02:25:44.304]  And then it cuts to a meeting that held in Geneva, Switzerland back in December, December 3rd, 2019.
[02:25:44.344 --> 02:25:44.744]  And she's like,
[02:25:46.625 --> 02:25:48.387]  You know, we don't know what's wrong with these things.
[02:25:48.407 --> 02:25:51.129]  People are asking us why their children are dying and we can't give them answers.
[02:25:51.169 --> 02:25:52.650]  So we have to be able to give them answers.
[02:25:53.070 --> 02:25:57.233]  And she's like, a lot of the time, we don't find out what's wrong with these vaccines until after they're approved.
[02:25:58.134 --> 02:25:59.155]  This is the insanity.
[02:25:59.375 --> 02:26:04.599]  And you have armies of lemmings out there on Twitter and on social media telling you you're a bad person.
[02:26:04.619 --> 02:26:06.620]  And you're going to kill me if you don't take them.
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:11.985]  Yeah, that you're bad because you're not listening to these health officials who are saying in public meetings
[02:26:12.984 --> 02:26:17.707]  Although this one might have been private, that we don't know why people are dying from these things.
[02:26:17.787 --> 02:26:18.888]  We don't know why.
[02:26:18.908 --> 02:26:22.230]  And they're not tested, so we don't know because they're not tested.
[02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:24.111]  And if they are, it's kept secret.
[02:26:24.131 --> 02:26:24.931]  So I want to explain this.
[02:26:25.732 --> 02:26:28.894]  They're saying, we know stuff's going on, but that's just the way it is.
[02:26:28.934 --> 02:26:35.778]  But then she goes out, this is leaked from the meeting, and then she goes out and she's on television saying, it's great, you need to take it.
[02:26:36.118 --> 02:26:37.079]  It's absolutely outrageous.
[02:26:37.099 --> 02:26:41.682]  And then later, we're live right now, but I want to add this in post and put it out this afternoon, just this live talk.
[02:26:42.839 --> 02:26:46.203]  Remember in 2002 it came out on ABC News back when they did their job.
[02:26:46.223 --> 02:26:55.253]  They had some journalist left because they got the minutes via a lawsuit and then there was a whistleblower leaked more and then a congressman whose grandson got brain damaged.
[02:26:55.293 --> 02:26:56.114]  We can find this clip.
[02:26:56.254 --> 02:26:56.394]  Right.
[02:26:56.414 --> 02:26:57.035]  But we'll add it.
[02:26:58.314 --> 02:27:02.478]  His grandson was two years old, took the shot at convulsions, blood came out his nose, never talked again.
[02:27:03.179 --> 02:27:04.420]  He was in diapers ten years later.
[02:27:05.181 --> 02:27:06.622]  Back at that time, he says BS.
[02:27:07.043 --> 02:27:14.010]  He demanded it, subpoenaed it from Congress, and got the full record of the head of the CDC saying, my gosh, I'm not giving my grandkids this.
[02:27:14.270 --> 02:27:15.311]  We've damaged millions.
[02:27:15.471 --> 02:27:16.973]  They'll kill us if they discover it.
[02:27:17.153 --> 02:27:21.156]  These are the damn transcripts from the meeting with the head of the CDC!
[02:27:21.216 --> 02:27:21.836]  Cover it up!
[02:27:22.097 --> 02:27:23.097]  My God, they'll kill us!
[02:27:23.798 --> 02:27:27.661]  But see, once they got the... But they also say, we better clean this up.
[02:27:27.761 --> 02:27:28.041]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:28.361 --> 02:27:30.723]  But you notice, once they covered it all up, there's never a clean up.
[02:27:31.143 --> 02:27:37.028]  The military has been given dozens of experimental vaccines, like anthrax and others, as guinea pigs.
[02:27:38.052 --> 02:27:44.075]  But it's still illegal to give the military experimental vaccines, unless the Pentagon again declares it an emergency, just like governors do it.
[02:27:44.155 --> 02:27:47.536]  So, this is very, very, very dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:47.556 --> 02:27:49.137]  We're going to go to this clip right now.
[02:27:49.257 --> 02:27:49.637]  Here it is.
[02:27:54.104 --> 02:27:54.965]  Again, it has a screen.
[02:27:55.125 --> 02:27:57.648]  WHO works to ensure vaccinations are safe and effective.
[02:27:57.668 --> 02:27:58.669]  Here's the head of it.
[02:27:58.689 --> 02:28:00.010]  Vaccines are very safe.
[02:28:01.011 --> 02:28:12.623]  If someone gets sick after vaccination, it is usually either a coincidence, an error in administering the vaccine, or very rarely a problem with the vaccine itself.
[02:28:13.524 --> 02:28:15.726]  That's why we have vaccine safety systems.
[02:28:16.246 --> 02:28:24.673]  Robust vaccine safety systems allow health workers and experts to react immediately to any problems that may arise.
[02:28:25.674 --> 02:28:33.961]  They can examine the problem rigorously and scientifically, look at the data and then promptly address the problem.
[02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:43.731]  WHO works closely with countries to make sure that vaccines can do what they do best.
[02:28:44.291 --> 02:28:46.432]  Prevent disease without risks.
[02:28:52.333 --> 02:29:02.755]  New vaccines against malaria, meningitis and encephalitis in Asia and Africa are now being thoroughly monitored with support from WHO.
[02:29:05.967 --> 02:29:07.068]  Here she is rolling out the program.
[02:29:07.088 --> 02:29:13.153]  Vaccines are one of the safest tools we have to prevent disease and ensure a healthy future for all children.
[02:29:13.173 --> 02:29:14.154]  Now here's what she really said.
[02:29:14.515 --> 02:29:14.755]  Yeah.
[02:29:14.835 --> 02:29:20.720]  Five days later, she discussed vaccine safety behind closed doors at the WHO Global Vaccine Safety Summit.
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:21.261]  Here it is.
[02:29:21.381 --> 02:29:31.009]  I think we cannot overemphasize the fact that we really don't have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the
[02:29:32.096 --> 02:29:42.444]  Communication and the misapprehensions because we're not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine and this always gets blown up in the media.
[02:29:43.565 --> 02:29:57.717]  One should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the cause of deaths are but in most cases there's some obfuscation at that level and therefore there's less and less trust then in the system.
[02:29:58.097 --> 02:29:58.818]  Putting in place
[02:29:59.554 --> 02:29:59.794]  Thank you.
[02:30:20.204 --> 02:30:26.128]  You've learned about adverse events only after the drug's been licensed and introduced into the population.
[02:30:26.608 --> 02:30:37.796]  So I think that risk is always there and the population needs to understand that and feel confident that mechanisms are being put in place to study some of those things.
[02:30:38.616 --> 02:30:39.937]  Simply earth shattering.
[02:30:40.037 --> 02:30:41.979]  And again, she's just saying common sense stuff.
[02:30:42.859 --> 02:30:44.601]  In fact, if you look at different countries, it varies.
[02:30:44.661 --> 02:30:50.585]  But in the United States, about a third of drugs end up getting pulled or they restrict them for only emergency situations.
[02:30:51.085 --> 02:30:54.068]  And that's because they put them out and then they have problems, they pull them back.
[02:30:54.448 --> 02:30:54.648]  I don't
[02:31:16.443 --> 02:31:20.986]  Again, Alzheimer's vaccine that has the body attack certain proteins in the brain.
[02:31:21.327 --> 02:31:22.628]  And then it has all these other side effects.
[02:31:22.648 --> 02:31:27.191]  So, vaccine just means something they're going to inject in you, and they're going to have liability protection.
[02:31:27.391 --> 02:31:28.932]  How freaking crazy is that, Rob?
[02:31:29.232 --> 02:31:29.873]  It's ridiculous.
[02:31:30.033 --> 02:31:42.262]  And the fact that people fall for it, people don't want to ask questions, people are afraid to question the medical model, is even scarier that they will willingly line their children up to be systematically, mentally, and physically destroyed.
[02:31:42.322 --> 02:31:42.762]  It's so sickening.
[02:31:42.802 --> 02:31:43.303]  It's worse than that.
[02:31:43.323 --> 02:31:46.065]  It came out that the world leaders have secret, clean vaccines.
[02:31:46.425 --> 02:31:47.746]  I want access to those clean ones!
[02:31:47.986 --> 02:31:49.427]  Don't tell me I don't believe in the science!
[02:31:49.987 --> 02:31:51.828]  Stop dumping poison crap on us!
[02:31:52.388 --> 02:31:54.289]  I got more breaking than Dr. Baggage is coming up with!
[02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:56.090]  We got breaking Elizabeth Warren news!
[02:31:56.810 --> 02:32:02.853]  A lot of big news has been breaking on Fridays, and I've begged Dr. Nick Baggage to do a show once a week here, but he's such a trooper.
[02:32:03.254 --> 02:32:06.735]  I've preempted him like three times in a row, so I apologize, but he's taking over here in just a few minutes.
[02:32:07.156 --> 02:32:09.557]  But then this huge news was breaking on the vaccine cover-ups.
[02:32:09.577 --> 02:32:11.838]  We're going to him, and he's taking over here in just one moment.
[02:32:12.699 --> 02:32:13.759]  But Rob, just finishing up.
[02:32:15.816 --> 02:32:18.738]  This is the head of the World Health Organization's Science Bureau.
[02:32:18.979 --> 02:32:19.919]  Right, the Chief Scientist.
[02:32:20.019 --> 02:32:29.848]  Chief Scientist of the UN, saying, these are killing people, we're covering it up, we don't have a surveillance system, people are hearing about it, they're getting pissed, we better clean it up.
[02:32:30.028 --> 02:32:32.510]  You gotta figure out a way to lie to them, essentially, is what she's saying.
[02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:36.073]  Yeah, so, so long, this has been, days after she tells the lies, this is all safe.
[02:32:36.153 --> 02:32:36.353]  Yeah.
[02:32:37.165 --> 02:32:37.905]  Folks, it's over.
[02:32:38.005 --> 02:32:41.586]  They're not going to be able to cover this up with Facebook censoring these discussions.
[02:32:41.646 --> 02:32:42.026]  It's over.
[02:32:42.586 --> 02:32:44.967]  So, a big report's coming out on that today.
[02:32:45.007 --> 02:32:50.088]  We'll add some clips to what we just did, and then no one, you and I, will work over the weekend to get this out, because I'm already up here all weekend.
[02:32:50.128 --> 02:32:51.348]  But this is huge, brother.
[02:32:51.849 --> 02:32:52.409]  It really is.
[02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:56.230]  And you've got to look at the people in New Jersey who are fighting for their health freedom right now.
[02:32:56.270 --> 02:32:58.150]  They're storming Congress.
[02:32:58.470 --> 02:33:03.931]  They're speaking out because they're not taking this, oh, safe and effective answer as an answer anymore.
[02:33:03.972 --> 02:33:04.452]  They know.
[02:33:04.732 --> 02:33:05.572]  They've seen the children.
[02:33:06.052 --> 02:33:08.715]  The anthrax vaccine killed hundreds of U.S.
[02:33:08.755 --> 02:33:09.896]  military conservatively.
[02:33:10.016 --> 02:33:11.377]  They admitted it was killing people.
[02:33:11.638 --> 02:33:13.440]  Stop saying it doesn't hurt people.
[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:14.981]  Stop saying it's all safe.
[02:33:15.241 --> 02:33:16.403]  You just have to look at the children.
[02:33:16.463 --> 02:33:20.026]  Everybody knows that the peanut allergy is because they grew vaccines on peanuts.
[02:33:20.066 --> 02:33:20.247]  Yeah.
[02:33:20.647 --> 02:33:24.851]  And then they stopped doing it and then now all these kids aren't being born that die if they go around peanuts.
[02:33:25.712 --> 02:33:26.833]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:33:26.873 --> 02:33:28.074]  You people are out of control.
[02:33:28.434 --> 02:33:33.538]  And the trailblazer, literally, before I was here or anybody, on the science was Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:33:33.819 --> 02:33:34.779]  He's taking over in a moment.
[02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:35.720]  Rob, let's do this last thing.
[02:33:35.740 --> 02:33:36.381]  We've got to get him on.
[02:33:36.641 --> 02:33:36.841]  Yeah.
[02:33:37.061 --> 02:33:39.764]  Well, speaking of speaking out, this Elizabeth Warren clip.
[02:33:40.364 --> 02:33:46.309]  Everything is about confronting the scum with facts and knowledge like Owen did, like everybody's doing, like you've been doing, folks.
[02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:47.630]  This is what's going to defeat them.
[02:33:47.850 --> 02:33:48.811]  Not just get Trump in.
[02:33:48.851 --> 02:33:49.652]  Trump's not perfect.
[02:33:49.812 --> 02:33:50.532]  Trump isn't going to save us.
[02:33:50.552 --> 02:33:51.153]  We're going to save ourselves.
[02:33:51.173 --> 02:33:52.074]  We're going to save ourselves.
[02:33:52.094 --> 02:33:52.494]  With God's help.
[02:33:52.794 --> 02:33:55.676]  We gotta confront all these scum like Pocahontas.
[02:33:55.696 --> 02:33:56.616]  Tell us what happened.
[02:33:56.797 --> 02:33:57.537]  24hours.com.
[02:33:57.557 --> 02:34:06.122]  This biker with a cross on his back goes in and confronts her and tells her she's a fraud and disgusting for siding with Iran in this situation.
[02:34:06.582 --> 02:34:08.163]  And we need more people like this.
[02:34:08.303 --> 02:34:09.944]  His relatives were veterans.
[02:34:10.305 --> 02:34:13.927]  And he's sick and tired of these people marching around like they own the place.
[02:34:14.087 --> 02:34:17.170]  Well, especially when Obama and all them help do this whole destabilization.
[02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.510]  Sure!
[02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:29.221]  Because I don't like all this expansion of war stuff, but the point is that unifying... suddenly the left, you know, love war, then Trump's against it, you know, now they love war, then Trump looks like he's for war, now they're against war.
[02:34:29.561 --> 02:34:30.562]  Here is the confrontation.
[02:34:32.585 --> 02:34:34.046]  It's so good to be here with you.
[02:34:34.066 --> 02:34:35.507]  This is... Shut up, Chancellor!
[02:34:35.527 --> 02:34:37.149]  My grandfather was a robot, too!
[02:34:37.669 --> 02:34:39.070]  You're saying it was racist!
[02:34:39.090 --> 02:34:40.571]  You're saying it was iranian!
[02:34:41.012 --> 02:34:42.733]  Why are you saying it was terrorist law?!
[02:34:43.353 --> 02:34:45.035]  Why are you saying it was terrorist law?!
[02:34:45.415 --> 02:34:47.477]  My grandfather died a robot, too!
[02:34:47.797 --> 02:34:48.598]  You're a fraud!
[02:34:49.378 --> 02:34:50.179]  Disgusting!
[02:34:50.479 --> 02:34:51.560]  We do deal with this!
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:52.200]  Liar!
[02:34:52.501 --> 02:34:52.701]  Boo!
[02:34:52.941 --> 02:34:53.221]  Boo!
[02:34:58.018 --> 02:34:59.559]  The First Amendment in action right there.
[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:04.404]  And whether you agree with this guy or not, the point is Elizabeth Warren is an anti-American globalist.
[02:35:04.444 --> 02:35:06.326]  They need to be confronted and this is what they fear.
[02:35:08.108 --> 02:35:10.390]  And she goes, oh it's nice to have you here.
[02:35:10.410 --> 02:35:14.474]  It's good to see you.
[02:35:17.381 --> 02:35:18.082]  Oh, I'm having a beer.
[02:35:18.122 --> 02:35:18.442]  Want one?
[02:35:19.263 --> 02:35:20.284]  Let him go.
[02:35:20.344 --> 02:35:21.825]  It's alright.
[02:35:21.985 --> 02:35:22.526]  It's alright.
[02:35:22.566 --> 02:35:23.767]  Notice the room size, too.
[02:35:23.907 --> 02:35:25.148]  About 40 people in this room.
[02:35:25.228 --> 02:35:27.971]  And it turns out that she doesn't drink beer.
[02:35:28.411 --> 02:35:28.571]  Yeah.
[02:35:29.212 --> 02:35:29.993]  He tries to drink beer.
[02:35:30.013 --> 02:35:31.574]  Look, I'm a human from your planet.
[02:35:31.774 --> 02:35:32.515]  I drink beer.
[02:35:33.075 --> 02:35:34.877]  Dr. Nick Baggage is taking over right now.
[02:35:34.897 --> 02:35:35.498]  We love him.
[02:35:36.479 --> 02:35:38.562]  Thank you, author, filmmaker, find it all.
[02:35:38.582 --> 02:35:41.446]  It is an amazing website, and we sell his films at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:35:41.827 --> 02:35:43.409]  Our big sale, a lot of stuff sold out.
[02:35:43.509 --> 02:35:44.570]  It's still just going to the weekend.
[02:35:44.591 --> 02:35:47.835]  I was too busy to take the stuff off sale, so a lot of it will just sell out and we won't have it for months.
[02:35:48.256 --> 02:35:50.279]  Please, we need your financial support, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:35:50.559 --> 02:35:52.181]  Dr. Nick Begich, take it away, and God bless you.
[02:35:52.201 --> 02:35:52.522]  We love you.
[02:35:53.573 --> 02:35:54.593]  Hey, thanks very much.
[02:35:54.673 --> 02:35:58.015]  And it's it's always great to be with the team down there.
[02:35:58.035 --> 02:36:01.456]  And, you know, the preemptions don't bother me because it's about the news.
[02:36:01.536 --> 02:36:03.097]  It's about what's going on in the world.
[02:36:03.137 --> 02:36:05.938]  And that's about information on InfoWars whole mission.
[02:36:05.998 --> 02:36:23.224]  And so I'm just really glad to be a part of the team and get the opportunity to bring issues and talk about issues that are important, at least in my view of where we're headed, you know, and what Alex and Rob were just talking about, you know, the whole idea that, hey, this is about
[02:36:23.971 --> 02:36:28.834]  You know, and Alex says it all the time, you know, the tip of the spear, right?
[02:36:28.894 --> 02:36:29.255]  It's you.
[02:36:29.875 --> 02:36:39.662]  And think about it, you know, and I'm thinking, you know, and I met somebody who sees me on the screen when I'm on in Anchorage here in the last few days.
[02:36:40.422 --> 02:36:41.723]  And the guy said, you know, it's great.
[02:36:41.743 --> 02:36:44.025]  You know, it's good to see you out there doing stuff.
[02:36:44.125 --> 02:36:46.747]  And what InfoWars is doing makes a difference.
[02:36:46.787 --> 02:36:49.390]  And I'm glad to be involved in that.
[02:36:49.510 --> 02:36:50.711]  And you know, that's really it.
[02:36:50.791 --> 02:36:53.153]  Everyone out there is involved in this.
[02:36:53.693 --> 02:36:55.314]  And here's what it really means to me.
[02:36:55.334 --> 02:36:56.235]  You know, I got a staff.
[02:36:56.335 --> 02:36:56.776]  It's me.
[02:36:57.456 --> 02:37:01.699]  Okay, and I got someone that helps me about five hours a week otherwise.
[02:37:01.739 --> 02:37:02.919]  So otherwise, that's me.
[02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:13.085]  And then there's this team in Austin that's InfoWars that puts all this together, makes us look great, gets us out into the world so we can express ourselves in the world.
[02:37:13.185 --> 02:37:15.026]  And then the real team is you.
[02:37:15.567 --> 02:37:23.771]  When you, you know, get up in the morning and look in the mirror, man, you're the team that we rely on every single day to get the message out.
[02:37:23.911 --> 02:37:24.472]  So thanks.
[02:37:25.092 --> 02:37:30.575]  For that, going into this New Year, my first broadcast of the New Year here.
[02:37:30.755 --> 02:37:40.521]  And last night, for those who might have caught me, I was on Coast to Coast AM, sort of the other end of the radio spectrum, talking about issues of matter, you know.
[02:37:41.561 --> 02:37:42.402]  Here's the thing.
[02:37:42.502 --> 02:37:49.667]  All this stuff that we've been talking about and everything on today, again, are symptoms, right, of people behaving badly.
[02:37:49.727 --> 02:37:50.628]  And Alex is right.
[02:37:50.648 --> 02:37:54.431]  You know, whatever Trump is for, the Democrats will be against.
[02:37:54.511 --> 02:37:56.392]  And whatever he's against, they'll be for.
[02:37:57.333 --> 02:38:07.023]  It isn't about policy, it's about tribalism, it's about separation, it's about breaking up the human spirit, dissolving us into some battle that doesn't need to happen.
[02:38:07.063 --> 02:38:12.169]  Because what I know, and a lot of my discussion lately has been about this, is
[02:38:12.913 --> 02:38:17.857]  The underlying value systems, if you can keep them alive, aren't gone.
[02:38:17.917 --> 02:38:22.300]  But here's what's happened, and this is like the mind control of the game.
[02:38:22.921 --> 02:38:26.503]  And it's really simple, because here's how propaganda works.
[02:38:26.643 --> 02:38:35.130]  First thing you do, and this is what happened in Germany, why a lot of very educated people in their 30s did all this crazy, atrocious kind of stuff, you know.
[02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:36.791]  But here's how it starts.
[02:38:36.891 --> 02:38:48.862]  The first thing you have to do is get people to shut up and quit speaking their truth because in those days, you know, you might get in trouble and today you might get trouble.
[02:38:49.102 --> 02:38:54.807]  Political correctness, you know, so everyone guards their speech, withholds their truth.
[02:38:55.487 --> 02:38:59.551]  And then what happens on the left often is they then begin to
[02:39:00.331 --> 02:39:23.284]  Repeat something that they don't believe in also happens on the right so people begin to express things they don't believe in and as you do that you shut down your consciousness that part of your brain and your awareness that connects you to all that is if you will you know and and so the slippery slope is first you lie to yourself they call this tolerance
[02:39:23.959 --> 02:39:27.300]  And I've talked about this before, and we need to think about this differently.
[02:39:27.900 --> 02:39:31.921]  I talk about acceptance, except the fact that the guy is going to disagree with you.
[02:39:31.961 --> 02:39:33.401]  That's a fact of the matter.
[02:39:33.421 --> 02:39:34.321]  You're going to run into it.
[02:39:34.941 --> 02:39:38.402]  But do this with dignity in terms of the discussion.
[02:39:38.442 --> 02:39:41.282]  This is where it turns on, or maybe we get somewhere.
[02:39:41.322 --> 02:39:45.483]  You've got to be able to recognize that we're creating the image and likeness of God.
[02:39:45.523 --> 02:39:48.904]  So when you look in the eyes of your adversary, you see yourself a little bit there.
[02:39:49.631 --> 02:39:55.612]  And as you do, listen carefully to all the arguments, because most people have some logic stream, you hope.
[02:39:56.213 --> 02:40:01.494]  And then you get the facts you're missing, or you find out what hole there is there in their argument, you've got a chance to present it.
[02:40:01.674 --> 02:40:02.954]  And that changes the world.
[02:40:02.974 --> 02:40:05.675]  And together, it's about information, InfoWars.
[02:40:06.155 --> 02:40:15.397]  And I want to talk about InfoWars and what is not social media, but is, in fact, social manipulation that we have to guard against, which requires thinking
[02:40:16.144 --> 02:40:21.898]  With a heart, with a consciousness, with what we are in our fundamental creative being.
[02:40:21.938 --> 02:40:24.203]  So together, let's do the InfoWars.
[02:40:24.243 --> 02:40:26.208]  We'll be right back in just a couple of minutes.
[02:40:27.467 --> 02:40:30.248]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[02:40:30.448 --> 02:40:32.068]  And this is Dr. Nick Begg.
[02:40:32.088 --> 02:40:33.769]  It's coming to you from my home in Alaska.
[02:40:33.809 --> 02:40:43.492]  And I was during the break, I was talking to Sean and, you know, it's minus 12 here today and supposed to be minus 20 later, you know, so it's cold.
[02:40:43.792 --> 02:40:45.973]  I mean, it is cold and it is dark.
[02:40:47.478 --> 02:40:47.979]  Dark.
[02:40:50.161 --> 02:40:53.504]  And so anyway, Alaska, what a place.
[02:40:53.664 --> 02:41:09.438]  And, you know, thinking about some of the things happening in the world and talking about just going into the last break, getting into the topic of the day, which to me is really about social manipulation and how that all happens and what's happening and not just creating culture and reality.
[02:41:09.478 --> 02:41:11.080]  I mean, really, fundamentally,
[02:41:11.798 --> 02:41:14.240]  Forming reality all around us.
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:19.924]  And I'm 61 this year and headed for 62.
[02:41:20.945 --> 02:41:23.987]  And 2020 represents to me vision, right?
[02:41:24.347 --> 02:41:24.747]  2020 vision.
[02:41:25.248 --> 02:41:31.693]  And we should each get a vision for our life, a vision for this network, a vision for the country and where we're headed.
[02:41:32.013 --> 02:41:36.296]  And wherever you live, in whatever sovereign land you're here in,
[02:41:36.476 --> 02:41:36.636]  Yes.
[02:41:46.793 --> 02:41:52.838]  Our sovereignty as individuals and as communities and as countries, quite frankly.
[02:41:52.898 --> 02:41:58.784]  And, you know, that's why America is, you know, a republic, a federation of states, too.
[02:41:59.164 --> 02:42:03.848]  And although we kind of forgot a lot of that along the way, which is a topic for another day.
[02:42:04.388 --> 02:42:10.634]  But having said that, you know, personal privacy, social manipulation, how's that playing out?
[02:42:10.694 --> 02:42:13.436]  You know, and I was really looking at my material I published in 2000.
[02:42:15.081 --> 02:42:42.857]  20 years ago and then you know kind of looking back in time and what we predicted then and sort of where we're at now and everyone's so amazed you know about all this stuff they think is so cool that's so convenient we said hey wait a minute remember there'll be a flip side to the equation and yeah you'll be under the microscope uh and we are um we have fundamentally given up every shred of personal privacy and you know you can look at it from this perspective you know here's a thing for the future
[02:42:43.439 --> 02:42:44.620]  That's happening now, right?
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:47.241]  Because it's already been piloted and tested and all that.
[02:42:47.641 --> 02:42:54.804]  But because of electric cars and now the imbalance on who's paying for roads, because it's not out of the gasoline tax, you're going to hear them taxed by the mile.
[02:42:55.464 --> 02:43:01.247]  And all that meters on your cars will track your miles and every place you go to register your tax.
[02:43:01.927 --> 02:43:02.167]  Right.
[02:43:02.588 --> 02:43:04.769]  And then that will set your insurance premiums.
[02:43:04.889 --> 02:43:05.189]  Right.
[02:43:05.529 --> 02:43:16.536]  And then everywhere you stop, you know, like the liquor store or wherever you made your route, the junk food restaurant six times a week or whatever, you know, I mean, that'll all affect your rates and your ratings.
[02:43:16.556 --> 02:43:22.880]  And as data is collected, see, it all ties back into the economic system and the feedback loops.
[02:43:23.539 --> 02:43:24.360]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:43:40.898 --> 02:43:43.919]  Salivating, you know, and this is what is actually happening.
[02:43:43.959 --> 02:43:45.499]  I predicted, Alex predicted it.
[02:43:45.899 --> 02:43:50.521]  That's why it's an info war, ladies and gentlemen, because it truly is about information.
[02:43:50.541 --> 02:43:53.541]  But more importantly, it's about how it's programmed in.
[02:43:53.561 --> 02:43:56.242]  And there's a guy out there, Dr. Robert Epstein.
[02:43:56.282 --> 02:43:58.683]  And I know I'm confusing with the pervert Epstein.
[02:43:58.703 --> 02:44:00.163]  This is Dr. Robert Epstein.
[02:44:00.703 --> 02:44:05.191]  And he did this study that got peer-reviewed about this and social media, how it works.
[02:44:05.251 --> 02:44:07.215]  And he looked at Bing and Google and a few others.
[02:44:07.275 --> 02:44:12.564]  And Google, interesting, was the one that manipulates the data in such a way as to move numbers 20 to 80 percent.
[02:44:14.586 --> 02:44:17.567]  Uh, holy moly, not 2.6 million votes.
[02:44:17.607 --> 02:44:22.108]  That's the small number in the equation that Dr. Robert Epstein testified to.
[02:44:22.608 --> 02:44:25.149]  The big broad sweep is on neutral issues.
[02:44:25.169 --> 02:44:32.911]  You can move populations 20 to 80 percent, which is enough to win anything, or to move things and start to push the crowd into a direction.
[02:44:33.431 --> 02:44:37.953]  And this is what I'm talking about, propaganda and manipulation and the things we predicted.
[02:44:38.034 --> 02:44:48.399]  When big data and data valence, which is the phrase we used 20 years ago, manifested people, oh, don't worry, don't worry, you know, they can't even sort the data.
[02:44:48.439 --> 02:44:49.139]  Why worry?
[02:44:49.179 --> 02:44:49.720]  Why worry?
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:58.624]  Well, we told you why, because they would sort the data and they would have the data and they go backwards in time and predict your life forward better than you can even do it.
[02:44:58.644 --> 02:44:59.945]  And that's where we're at today.
[02:45:00.445 --> 02:45:11.675]  And we just got revealed that Cambridge Analytics influenced 68 countries' elections, not just one, something we predicted 20 years ago in the book Earth Rising, The Revolution, and Earth Rising 2.
[02:45:12.396 --> 02:45:18.241]  You know, those books, the only place you can get them in the world is InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:18.381 --> 02:45:19.982]  I don't even sell them on my website.
[02:45:20.022 --> 02:45:21.684]  Go look, EarthPulse.com.
[02:45:22.124 --> 02:45:23.486]  You can't buy anything there.
[02:45:23.506 --> 02:45:26.008]  The only place I sell books and videos anymore
[02:45:26.708 --> 02:45:31.292]  Uh, unless they're electronic on Amazon, because I, you know, I'm kind of stuck in that window for now.
[02:45:31.872 --> 02:45:38.457]  Uh, everyone else, I shut it down, moved it all over to InfoWars, uh, because it's about InfoWars and that's who I'm supporting.
[02:45:38.897 --> 02:45:42.200]  And they're helping me create content so I can get these issues out to you.
[02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:49.706]  Your part is, support InfoWars, please, so we can keep talking about all the things that are important.
[02:45:49.727 --> 02:45:52.189]  But social media is misnamed.
[02:45:52.269 --> 02:45:56.252]  It's part of this new phrase that you always hear now that you never heard 20 years ago.
[02:45:56.272 --> 02:45:58.795]  It's all called creating a narrative.
[02:45:58.875 --> 02:46:01.537]  You know, that's called, like, lying in a nice way.
[02:46:01.557 --> 02:46:03.339]  Creating a narrative.
[02:46:03.819 --> 02:46:05.401]  Forget that terminology.
[02:46:05.481 --> 02:46:08.063]  It's just switching words around, but the meaning is the same.
[02:46:09.189 --> 02:46:12.370]  I'm sure that might have a little bit of too much pain in one corner.
[02:46:12.810 --> 02:46:17.931]  You know, so here's the deal is it's about information, getting it out.
[02:46:18.132 --> 02:46:22.313]  And then, you know, sometimes, you know, we get it wrong, but that's not very often.
[02:46:22.733 --> 02:46:30.055]  On 25 years I've been in it and with Alex as an example, you know, on a lot of issues, don't get it wrong very often.
[02:46:30.135 --> 02:46:33.256]  Sometimes we do and we take responsibility.
[02:46:34.389 --> 02:46:35.671]  I'm doing this local initiative
[02:46:49.804 --> 02:46:57.090]  Here in Anchorage, and I've talked a little bit about it, you know, Intervention 2020, about what I think homelessness is, which is a false narrative.
[02:46:57.110 --> 02:47:02.674]  Also, it's about drug addiction, alcoholism, and mental illness that results in the symptom of homelessness.
[02:47:02.714 --> 02:47:05.296]  But we'll get into that maybe if we have time today.
[02:47:06.017 --> 02:47:06.978]  But the point is,
[02:47:07.988 --> 02:47:12.849]  Narratives, forming narratives, and then kind of painting the picture so you can go sell something.
[02:47:12.889 --> 02:47:37.414]  This is so much of what we are facing now is about that, and we provide the raw data in a way that if somebody just literally kicked in every one of our doorways, walked in our houses, and just rummaged through everything in our house, we're letting them do that with our digital doorways that hold more information than any of us hold in our houses.
[02:47:38.234 --> 02:47:39.696]  And the rules support that.
[02:47:39.736 --> 02:47:46.484]  And how does that support liberty and freedom and democracy and a republic or anything that is even close to that?
[02:47:46.544 --> 02:47:55.535]  And then what they do is they feed this garbage back that is not a reflection of reality, but a way to move reality.
[02:47:56.337 --> 02:48:11.617]  Down the direction and this is the dangerous situation that we're in right now is here's what we also know about it is the brain activity that occurs the reward system in the brain is so incredible that creates addictive behaviors
[02:48:12.077 --> 02:48:24.952]  And then to make them even better, they use three-dimensional MRIs, look at the brain in real time, creating gaming and all of the interactions with the internet because everyone's competing for your attention to then move the herd.
[02:48:24.972 --> 02:48:27.795]  And the better they move the herd, the more money people pay them to do it.
[02:48:28.355 --> 02:48:31.518]  And here's the last semblance of independent media.
[02:48:31.558 --> 02:48:38.724]  Just a few portals left in the world, you know, that at least appear to be presenting an alternative view.
[02:48:38.904 --> 02:48:42.187]  And InfoWars is one that I totally support.
[02:48:42.867 --> 02:48:45.590]  Coast-to-Coast for their opposite spectrum I do.
[02:48:46.010 --> 02:48:48.932]  Nexus, which is an information speed.
[02:48:49.012 --> 02:48:51.114]  Nexus News Feed I support.
[02:48:51.254 --> 02:48:53.116]  Zero Hedge and Drudge, you know, because
[02:48:53.696 --> 02:49:03.018]  These give you an aggregation of things and you can sort it out, you know, and I appreciate that because that means that we're intelligent enough to sort it out.
[02:49:03.418 --> 02:49:10.740]  And I believe in you to sort it out and don't let anyone shut our voices down because you can change the channel.
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:15.441]  There's a billion channels, you know, everyone's competing for everyone's attention.
[02:49:16.241 --> 02:49:17.081]  But pay attention.
[02:49:17.987 --> 02:49:20.670]  Pay attention is one of the secrets of it all.
[02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:37.266]  And look in other directions from time to time to get a broader perspective on what's going on in the world so you can engage it with knowledge and the force of emotion and personality that each of us carry when we're carrying our knowledge and do it respectfully and with dignity.
[02:49:37.446 --> 02:49:42.371]  And instead of being in media manipulation land and reality TV land,
[02:49:43.104 --> 02:49:46.946]  Move it around, not social manipulation anymore that they call social media.
[02:49:47.546 --> 02:49:52.068]  Our new narrative is freedom, liberty, and our pursuit of happiness.
[02:49:52.448 --> 02:49:58.010]  By self-actualizing our health, our highest potential has created living souls on the planet.
[02:49:58.530 --> 02:50:01.332]  That's what we ought to be doing, and that's the first piece of the info war.
[02:50:01.692 --> 02:50:02.332]  I'll be right back.
[02:50:03.895 --> 02:50:27.269]  And welcome back and you know talking about this whole surveillance set you know when you stop and think about think about how much information I was using the illustration of what they'll do with tracking your car and then your movements and then it affects your insurance and then it shows where you stop which affects other aspects and then and then they show who was with you at the time because their little device tells our
[02:50:28.021 --> 02:50:30.623]  You know, it delivers the same information.
[02:50:31.024 --> 02:50:39.511]  And then you look at all those overlays, and then you look at what's happening in the world, and the video feed is showing the Chinese version of facial recognition now.
[02:50:40.011 --> 02:50:42.794]  I mean, it's total, absolute control.
[02:50:42.834 --> 02:50:53.563]  Those that listen already know the Chinese model of social scoring, the India model of biometrics using three perimeters, fingerprints, iris scans, and facial recognition.
[02:50:54.103 --> 02:50:54.824]  We're good to go.
[02:51:13.559 --> 02:51:14.720]  We're good to go.
[02:51:29.207 --> 02:51:32.349]  Because what's probably going to happen in Germany is you're going to tax the gold.
[02:51:32.409 --> 02:51:37.111]  That's another way to create a revenue stream to the government.
[02:51:37.191 --> 02:51:39.773]  So you've got these negative interest rates.
[02:51:39.793 --> 02:51:41.154]  They go to digital currency.
[02:51:41.214 --> 02:51:42.234]  Now you're stuck.
[02:51:42.354 --> 02:51:45.216]  All your money's in and they're taking a little bit every month from you.
[02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:49.862]  This is the new model for Europe coming by way of Germany.
[02:51:49.922 --> 02:51:55.904]  So when you start laying, and then of course to protect your money, your digital money, then they want your facial recognition.
[02:51:55.924 --> 02:52:06.528]  So they're going to probably run it in reverse, but they know it'll work because it's all been played out in India and the social scoring to get you in the game and keep you politically correct has been played out in India.
[02:52:07.489 --> 02:52:10.153]  And brought to you by the New World Order, right?
[02:52:10.193 --> 02:52:11.114]  Whoever they are.
[02:52:11.775 --> 02:52:13.558]  It's not about you anymore.
[02:52:13.598 --> 02:52:17.484]  It's anything more than a commodity plugged into the thing.
[02:52:17.524 --> 02:52:19.667]  You're a digital dot on the budget book.
[02:52:20.328 --> 02:52:22.091]  We represent nothing to these people.
[02:52:23.132 --> 02:52:31.278]  Within us, if we really believe this, is the spark of absolute creation, you know, in what we are, and we fail to see it.
[02:52:31.318 --> 02:52:44.006]  That's what scares the heck out of the other side of this whole equation is because when we actualize our potential, each one of us listening to this broadcast become that tip of the spear and do something.
[02:52:44.786 --> 02:52:47.987]  That's positive, proactive, that recognizes what we are.
[02:52:48.727 --> 02:52:53.068]  That is where the dignity of man defines us from something else.
[02:52:53.508 --> 02:52:56.509]  And that something else has had too much control of the agenda.
[02:52:56.889 --> 02:53:08.971]  And all of the things that we're talking about in InfoWars, whether it was, for me, whether it was mind control, heart, personal privacy, resources, banking, you know, all the things that everyone covers on this network.
[02:53:09.031 --> 02:53:12.552]  Health issues from vaccination to nutrition.
[02:53:14.072 --> 02:53:20.438]  All of the discussions that we get to have here are by virtue, we're not censored except by a few.
[02:53:20.959 --> 02:53:27.365]  And that censoring is what is destroying our ability to see freedom ring in the 21st century.
[02:53:27.445 --> 02:53:37.855]  And devices kind of might take the big solution to this, you know, because that's the other half of the thing is, okay, we all know this problem is we have to own our digital data.
[02:53:38.155 --> 02:53:38.916]  And this is what that means.
[02:53:38.916 --> 02:53:39.136]  Yes.
[02:53:39.156 --> 02:53:39.416]  Thank you.
[02:53:53.379 --> 02:53:53.920]  We're good to go.
[02:54:14.154 --> 02:54:14.894]  That doesn't work.
[02:54:15.014 --> 02:54:15.715]  We can't do that.
[02:54:15.755 --> 02:54:16.555]  We can't allow it.
[02:54:16.975 --> 02:54:18.495]  And you can't say yes if you're asked.
[02:54:18.716 --> 02:54:19.316]  So that's it.
[02:54:19.776 --> 02:54:26.418]  And so this is where we've come to with personal privacy today is we have to take control of it again.
[02:54:27.018 --> 02:54:42.783]  Once we've done that, and then we have to say, OK, if corporations have free speech and a right to influence elections, political outcomes, and they need culpability, accountability, responsibility, which means boards and presidents and vice presidents of corporations need to go to prison
[02:54:43.483 --> 02:54:52.053]  When those corporations do things that violate yours and my privacy and civil liberties, you see, that way they can't say, oh, it's a corporation.
[02:54:52.093 --> 02:54:52.434]  We can't.
[02:54:52.674 --> 02:54:52.974]  No, no.
[02:54:53.355 --> 02:54:54.797]  The guys who run it, oh, but we didn't know.
[02:54:54.837 --> 02:54:55.858]  Well, too bad you're running it.
[02:54:56.764 --> 02:54:58.825]  And it's called accountability and responsibility.
[02:54:58.845 --> 02:55:07.327]  You know, these are principled ideas, not conservative or liberal, they're principled ideas that we used to share in common, called accountability.
[02:55:07.927 --> 02:55:09.908]  And people try to escape it all the time.
[02:55:09.968 --> 02:55:12.889]  And this is the problem, not the solution.
[02:55:13.349 --> 02:55:14.650]  It's being responsible.
[02:55:14.990 --> 02:55:19.311]  And then, you know, if you can't, then the rest of us have to decide, you know, so that's called
[02:55:20.220 --> 02:55:33.374]  Laws and order and execution and that's gotten a bit complex for the average man doesn't really have access to justice in the same way that if you're rich you have access to justice.
[02:55:33.454 --> 02:55:36.938]  Ask Alex how much money it's spent on litigation.
[02:55:37.757 --> 02:55:41.818]  Because people attack him in that way, hoping to shut him down and silence his voice.
[02:55:42.339 --> 02:55:43.559]  And it's unfortunate, you know?
[02:55:43.579 --> 02:55:45.820]  I mean, and then they talk about socializing medicine.
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:47.260]  How about socializing justice?
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:49.041]  You know, how about socialized lawyers?
[02:55:49.161 --> 02:55:53.542]  You know, I mean, at least that's something constitutionally we're supposed to have.
[02:55:53.623 --> 02:56:06.527]  And it went from a law book in a couple volumes that Abraham Lincoln could hold under his arm and study and pass the bar and become a lawyer without going to college to something that fills up three floors of a law library that nobody can sort out.
[02:56:07.176 --> 02:56:08.957]  That's not justice and law.
[02:56:09.017 --> 02:56:15.179]  That's complexity for the sake of a few whose interest is served by that complexity and what it yields for them.
[02:56:15.699 --> 02:56:24.042]  And if you really look in the law library starting in three, you see nothing but special interest legislation compounded on top of itself.
[02:56:25.162 --> 02:56:33.785]  And here's the thing, you know, when you start to think about what it's about, it started with a lot of debate, a lot of argument, a lot of fighting.
[02:56:34.466 --> 02:56:44.920]  And see, the Republicans, when Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, remember, he had to take away from the Southern Democrats slavery as kind of an issue, you know, and it made people angry then.
[02:56:45.341 --> 02:56:50.368]  And politics has changed a lot in the last 150 years, I have to say, and thank God it has.
[02:56:50.968 --> 02:57:01.936]  And there's bigger issues to fight over, but I think fighting is the problem, and respecting is part of the solution, and then debate that's lively is part of the action plan.
[02:57:02.376 --> 02:57:08.941]  And, you know, I've used my own family as an analogy, because we have hard-right Republicans, we have libertarians, we have
[02:57:09.722 --> 02:57:15.768]  Moderates and we have independents and then we have Democrats and we have hard left Democrats.
[02:57:15.828 --> 02:57:21.153]  All of my family going to the same Thanksgiving and Christmas events, you know, and I can tell you it's a lively debate.
[02:57:21.994 --> 02:57:25.358]  And the beauty of that debate is at the end we embrace each other.
[02:57:26.233 --> 02:57:27.014]  We're good to go.
[02:57:49.861 --> 02:57:50.622]  We're good to go.
[02:58:09.916 --> 02:58:17.689]  I do it with my friends literally around the world that I work with professionally and my family and I encourage all of us to do that.
[02:58:17.829 --> 02:58:20.453]  Pick up the telephone, you know, the telephone.
[02:58:20.473 --> 02:58:23.398]  I hate these device things, but pick up your device and
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:34.107]  Communicate with your friends and family and make a point of it in a personal way with your voice and your face over a cup of coffee with your kids and do that.
[02:58:34.467 --> 02:58:36.148]  And it makes the difference in the world.
[02:58:36.548 --> 02:58:39.370]  And in doing it, put a different intention on it.
[02:58:39.650 --> 02:58:50.998]  Put a spin on it of respect and integrity and values and try to find the way to break into the conversation and share the info wars with what you believe is important.
[02:58:51.608 --> 02:58:56.811]  And get off of the train, the train wreck that's operating in slow motion.
[02:58:56.851 --> 02:58:58.853]  That's the manipulation of social media.
[02:58:59.493 --> 02:59:00.193]  Turn it off.
[02:59:00.333 --> 02:59:01.634]  Break the zombie trance.
[02:59:02.074 --> 02:59:02.835]  It's here now.
[02:59:02.895 --> 02:59:04.996]  We've been talking about it for 25 years.
[02:59:05.056 --> 02:59:05.577]  It's here now.
[02:59:06.697 --> 02:59:10.520]  This is the most unbelievable creation because here's how it works.
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:19.225]  When you get this many people focused in the same way, actually what happens is you begin to create the very fantasy
[02:59:20.020 --> 02:59:21.341]  That they share in common.
[02:59:22.222 --> 02:59:23.743]  This is where you got to break off.
[02:59:24.984 --> 02:59:25.704]  Break it off.
[02:59:26.785 --> 02:59:28.306]  And take a look around.
[02:59:31.368 --> 02:59:39.655]  Touch the world again in a different way and connect to each other in a different way and break off the tribalism that's driven by these systems.
[02:59:39.756 --> 02:59:50.505]  It actually is designed to isolate, manipulate, control, and push each of us in our own individualized programming plan.
[02:59:51.426 --> 02:59:53.688]  So you got to cut off the programming a bit
[02:59:54.489 --> 03:00:04.554]  And, you know, and open yourself up to your relationships and then spread the information that is important in all those different ways that bring us in touch with each other.
[03:00:04.574 --> 03:00:11.957]  This is Friday afternoon in most of our world, and I appreciate the time with InfoWars, everyone going into the weekend.
[03:00:11.997 --> 03:00:16.319]  This has been Dr. Nick Begich signing off, and we'll see you again next week.
[03:00:28.803 --> 03:00:32.568]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[03:00:33.108 --> 03:00:36.352]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[03:00:36.612 --> 03:00:39.276]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[03:00:39.876 --> 03:00:42.740]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[03:00:43.441 --> 03:00:45.082]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[03:00:45.663 --> 03:00:47.124]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[03:00:47.744 --> 03:00:52.846]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[03:00:53.206 --> 03:01:01.150]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[03:01:01.690 --> 03:01:08.073]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[03:01:08.393 --> 03:01:11.194]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[03:01:17.526 --> 03:01:22.910]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[03:01:23.351 --> 03:01:26.834]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[03:01:26.854 --> 03:01:29.195]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[03:01:29.215 --> 03:01:30.997]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[03:01:31.037 --> 03:01:38.143]  So here I am telling people Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[03:01:38.623 --> 03:01:39.083]  And I'm 45 years old.
[03:01:39.864 --> 03:01:41.205]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[03:01:41.845 --> 03:01:42.885]  And it's fluoride free.
[03:01:43.526 --> 03:01:46.747]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium.
[03:01:46.787 --> 03:01:50.309]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[03:01:50.389 --> 03:01:54.791]  And the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[03:01:55.071 --> 03:01:55.871]  It feels so good.
[03:01:56.351 --> 03:02:00.273]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[03:02:00.513 --> 03:02:06.296]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[03:02:06.696 --> 03:02:08.377]  Because I like the way it feels.
[03:02:17.441 --> 03:02:22.045]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[03:02:22.706 --> 03:02:24.067]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[03:02:25.448 --> 03:02:27.089]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[03:02:27.149 --> 03:02:28.731]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[03:02:28.811 --> 03:02:29.712]  That was a crazy week.
[03:02:29.772 --> 03:02:40.120]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[03:02:41.442 --> 03:02:42.763]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[03:02:44.249 --> 03:02:44.529]  I think?
[03:03:06.081 --> 03:03:07.202]  I want to take control of my life.
[03:03:07.282 --> 03:03:08.302]  I want to take control of my health.
[03:03:08.422 --> 03:03:11.924]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[03:03:12.304 --> 03:03:13.404]  Don't buy into the groupthink.
[03:03:13.484 --> 03:03:14.425]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[03:03:14.465 --> 03:03:15.385]  Drink the TurboForce.
[03:03:15.625 --> 03:03:17.166]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[03:03:17.926 --> 03:03:19.287]  And you want to know who they are?
[03:03:20.888 --> 03:03:21.868]  You watch Hollywood.
[03:03:21.888 --> 03:03:22.669]  That's who they are.
[03:03:22.849 --> 03:03:24.329]  They love pedophilia.
[03:03:24.369 --> 03:03:25.790]  They love devil worship.
[03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:27.491]  They love diseased children.
[03:03:27.651 --> 03:03:29.272]  They love leaking reactors.
[03:03:29.492 --> 03:03:30.672]  They love failure.
[03:03:30.892 --> 03:03:32.893]  They love their father, death!
[03:03:35.606 --> 03:03:36.186]  Well guess what?
[03:03:36.206 --> 03:03:37.067]  I don't love death!
[03:03:38.348 --> 03:03:40.630]  And I'm not gonna sit here and cower to you filth!
[03:03:41.931 --> 03:03:43.132]  I need to plug or we won't be here.
[03:03:44.733 --> 03:03:59.764]  Like I told you, it's not a gimmick that a lot of times a sale gets extended a day or two because I'm up here working on news stories and I'm working on things like that and we've got some sales coming up that the ads are gonna take some production and so
[03:04:01.041 --> 03:04:03.584]  Yes, the sale we're doing is doing the best the sale's ever done.
[03:04:03.604 --> 03:04:09.612]  Because people know that we've never had stuff at 50% to 75% off, straw-white free shipping, double patron points.
[03:04:09.952 --> 03:04:12.415]  We've sold out of probably half of our best sellers.
[03:04:12.636 --> 03:04:14.158]  We're on the verge of selling out of everything else.
[03:04:14.538 --> 03:04:16.941]  And so this sale will have to end.
[03:04:17.782 --> 03:04:18.442]  By tomorrow?
[03:04:18.803 --> 03:04:19.843]  By Thursday?
[03:04:19.903 --> 03:04:20.463]  By Friday?
[03:04:20.604 --> 03:04:21.104]  I don't know.
[03:04:21.704 --> 03:04:25.266]  Because I'm too busy to go look at all the inventory and make all the decisions.
[03:04:25.306 --> 03:04:26.687]  They just said, all this is sold out.
[03:04:27.047 --> 03:04:28.088]  This is about to sell out.
[03:04:28.148 --> 03:04:29.368]  This stuff's coming in a few weeks.
[03:04:29.708 --> 03:04:30.769]  This is coming in a few months.
[03:04:30.849 --> 03:04:32.710]  You really need to stop the sale.
[03:04:32.770 --> 03:04:34.131]  And I said, well, tell me what we got.
[03:04:34.171 --> 03:04:35.231]  Well, we sold out of this.
[03:04:35.331 --> 03:04:36.092]  We sold out of that.
[03:04:36.112 --> 03:04:37.333]  We're selling out of this.
[03:04:37.393 --> 03:04:38.073]  We sold out of that.
[03:04:38.273 --> 03:04:39.614]  But we got this, this, this, this, and that.
[03:04:39.634 --> 03:04:40.334]  It's real popular.
[03:04:40.374 --> 03:04:41.155]  We got all this stuff.
[03:04:41.195 --> 03:04:42.235]  And what do you want to do?
[03:04:42.335 --> 03:04:42.976]  I just said, you know what?
[03:04:42.996 --> 03:04:43.496]  I'm too busy.
[03:04:43.516 --> 03:04:44.236]  Just keep the sale going.
[03:04:45.717 --> 03:04:46.938]  And people are responding to it.
[03:04:47.972 --> 03:04:55.383]  And even though a lot of this stuff's being sold at cost or as a lost leader, we're keeping the sale going because they said no, but we're also selling a lot of stuff where we do make a profit.
[03:04:55.804 --> 03:04:58.407]  Some t-shirts, books, films, folks are really supporting.
[03:04:59.469 --> 03:05:03.315]  And so I'm just going to keep the sale going until I can get these ads cut.
[03:05:05.999 --> 03:05:07.760]  And I'll tell you what the new specials are going to be.
[03:05:07.780 --> 03:05:09.622]  They're going to be good, they're just not as wide as this.
[03:05:10.142 --> 03:05:12.744]  It's going to be on storable foods, water filtration, air filtration.
[03:05:12.764 --> 03:05:16.347]  It's the new year, time to get clean, time to be prepared as well.
[03:05:16.787 --> 03:05:20.910]  We've got the best units out there, but I want to get them in here and show them to you and shoot some produced ads.
[03:05:21.050 --> 03:05:24.012]  It'll take some time, not just be up here talking about stuff.
[03:05:24.433 --> 03:05:28.215]  So that's why I'm going to get that done today or tomorrow and just whenever they are, that's the new specials.
[03:05:29.087 --> 03:05:29.548]  We're good to go.
[03:05:41.621 --> 03:05:42.182]  Sold out!
[03:05:43.163 --> 03:05:45.485]  And all that stuff's important and it also funds our operations.
[03:05:45.566 --> 03:05:50.551]  So, if you want to fund the operation and get great products, you'll never be able to get a sale this big again.
[03:05:50.952 --> 03:05:55.116]  If we're ever selling stuff at cost again, across the board, it means we're closing.
[03:05:55.597 --> 03:06:02.425]  Because this is getting rid of inventory, funding into the future, and just something I did to know we could operate, you know, at least through the election.
[03:06:03.681 --> 03:06:09.266]  Because a lot of things we're not ordering as much inventory and we're going to sell it at a little bit higher price and so we can fund ourselves.
[03:06:09.546 --> 03:06:12.489]  I'm actually doing business planning, something I've never really done, to be able to fund this.
[03:06:14.022 --> 03:06:15.683]  The best deals of 2019 are almost over.
[03:06:15.723 --> 03:06:16.683]  Double Patriot points.
[03:06:17.183 --> 03:06:18.003]  Store-on free shipping.
[03:06:19.244 --> 03:06:20.444]  DNA Force Plus sold out.

[03:06:37.970 --> 03:06:39.830]  All apparel 25-30% still available.
[03:06:40.210 --> 03:06:42.531]  Real Red Pill Plus free bottle of biodiesel.
[03:06:43.031 --> 03:06:43.811]  That's at cost.
[03:06:43.831 --> 03:06:44.311]  Still available.
[03:06:44.331 --> 03:06:44.611]  50% off.
[03:06:44.671 --> 03:06:46.512]  And it just goes on.
[03:06:46.532 --> 03:06:48.332]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:48.352 --> 03:06:49.212]  30% off.
[03:06:49.432 --> 03:06:50.713]  Alexa Pure free shipping.
[03:06:50.753 --> 03:06:51.493]  That's a great deal.
[03:06:52.273 --> 03:06:53.133]  And so much more.
[03:06:53.193 --> 03:06:54.273]  That's how we fund our operations.
[03:06:54.293 --> 03:06:55.053]  We'll take advantage of it.
[03:06:55.434 --> 03:07:00.975]  And again, I'm taking on the globalists, the EU, the leftist CIA, the Hollywood pedophiles.
[03:07:01.035 --> 03:07:01.615]  I'm in the fight.
[03:07:01.835 --> 03:07:02.635]  Just keep me in the fight.
