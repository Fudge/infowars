[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:04.370]  You read their deeper literature, they say, oh, we're just going to overwrite the whole planet.
[00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.731]  We'll build hundreds of planets that we want.
[00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:06.771]  We're going to just be gods.
[00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:10.832]  So they tell the underlings, oh, we're going to kill everybody for the earth.
[00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:12.872]  Yes, but you'll be allowed to survive.
[00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:14.333]  We're only going to kill 50%.
[00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:16.433]  Well, it's actually 80.
[00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:17.674]  Well, it's actually 95.
[00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:19.214]  And then we just sit here.
[00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:21.075]  Oh, Alex, cover the election fraud.
[00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.495]  Oh, Alex, cover, you know, this or that.
[00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:25.456]  It's all this operation.
[00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.626]  Great New World is chemically sterilizing little boys.
[00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:32.106]  They wrote the book in 1932.
[00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:37.227]  It's published.
[00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:50.029]  And the authors, whose brother ran the UN program on eugenics, was the head of the World Eugenics Society, and founded transhumanism, said, this is our plan for you.
[00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.930]  George Orwell is a lightweight.
[00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.430]  We won't need police in the future.
[00:00:56.553 --> 00:01:05.545]  It won't be a boot stomping on the head forever because you're going to be chemically altered and genetically altered from birth to be a corporate product and you will love your slavery.
[00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:10.992]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:26.014]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:28.397]  You better believe you got one!
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.587]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:57.278]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:01:57.338 --> 00:02:05.349]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.534]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:02:08.554 --> 00:02:10.016]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:12.237]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:02:12.517 --> 00:02:14.618]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:02:14.838 --> 00:02:15.919]  This is all confirmed.
[00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:16.899]  This is not a drill.
[00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.961]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:22.742]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:23.342]  Apple 100%.
[00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:29.365]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:34.586]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:02:34.886 --> 00:02:35.726]  This is happening.
[00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:43.688]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:49.690]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.112]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:02.794]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:06.016]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:13.340]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.242]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:03:16.602 --> 00:03:21.545]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:23.446]  It is the virtual reality AI.
[00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:30.272]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:52.841]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:57.746]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:03.011]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a murderer of children.
[00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:11.037]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:04:11.557 --> 00:04:18.302]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:24.087]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:28.770]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.132]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:04:31.232 --> 00:04:32.133]  Now break free!
[00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:45.173]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:04:45.213 --> 00:04:47.874]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:52.156]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:53.036]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.924]  InfoWars has been banned.
[00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:15.624]  Arrested.
[00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:20.428]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.390]  Because we are effective.
[00:05:25.052 --> 00:05:26.533]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:28.515]  Go to Banned.Video.
[00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:31.317]  Download the videos and share.
[00:05:33.278 --> 00:05:36.961]  Support the Information War at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:42.353]  And never give up the fight.
[00:05:42.734 --> 00:06:01.787]  InfoWars.com There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:02.868]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:06:02.888 --> 00:06:08.612]  I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:06:08.652 --> 00:06:09.413]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:10.676]  What?
[00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:17.770]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.053]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:29.096]  But the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:06:29.116 --> 00:06:30.097]  You designed it, sir.
[00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:31.077]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:06:31.097 --> 00:06:32.478]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:06:32.738 --> 00:06:34.819]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:36.200]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.342]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit,
[00:06:40.922 --> 00:06:46.648]  You now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:06:46.668 --> 00:06:46.808]  Cameras.
[00:06:46.828 --> 00:06:47.148]  We need cameras.
[00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:48.209]  How did this happen?
[00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:49.791]  Who's to blame?
[00:06:50.632 --> 00:06:53.354]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:06:53.374 --> 00:06:55.236]  They will be held accountable.
[00:06:55.256 --> 00:07:01.142]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:07:02.347 --> 00:07:03.768]  I know why you did it.
[00:07:04.308 --> 00:07:05.409]  I know you were afraid.
[00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:06.510]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.450]  War?
[00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:08.211]  Terror?
[00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:09.111]  Disease?
[00:07:09.752 --> 00:07:15.595]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:07:16.196 --> 00:07:17.617]  Fear got the best of you.
[00:07:17.997 --> 00:07:21.959]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.580]  He promised you order.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.701]  He promised you peace.
[00:07:25.201 --> 00:07:28.744]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.672]  There is a war.
[00:07:36.973 --> 00:07:38.175]  It's happening now.
[00:07:39.037 --> 00:07:40.840]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:43.204]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:07:43.986 --> 00:07:45.429]  We are the resistance.
[00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:47.593]  We are the Infowar.
[00:07:57.384 --> 00:08:00.987]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[00:08:01.468 --> 00:08:09.536]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms glued to their televisions, too terrified to skip the commercials.
[00:08:09.976 --> 00:08:13.559]  Well, I think... NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.882]  I think we should go with the good old-fashioned public health care.
[00:08:17.143 --> 00:08:17.303]  Yeah.
[00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.325]  A new disease.
[00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:20.205]  No one's immune.
[00:08:20.525 --> 00:08:23.787]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[00:08:23.967 --> 00:08:25.668]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:30.531]  Now I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:32.152]  He loves being that guy.
[00:08:32.232 --> 00:08:34.674]  But Janice, we do have standards.
[00:08:34.874 --> 00:08:36.595]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[00:08:36.855 --> 00:08:41.178]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[00:08:41.358 --> 00:08:44.780]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.861]  Get over here, NBC.
[00:08:48.182 --> 00:08:51.503]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh.
[00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:54.324]  Wow.
[00:08:55.024 --> 00:08:55.284]  Wow.
[00:08:55.805 --> 00:08:56.285]  Oh, yeah.
[00:08:56.425 --> 00:08:58.225]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:02.887]  Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:05.488]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[00:09:05.868 --> 00:09:08.168]  House cat flu is coming, people.
[00:09:08.369 --> 00:09:15.751]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[00:09:17.526 --> 00:09:22.129]  You see, I've studied the globalists and how they operate for most of my life.
[00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:29.815]  I was fascinated with it from a very young age, seeing
[00:09:47.861 --> 00:09:49.322]  Their statements and their admissions.
[00:09:50.363 --> 00:09:55.046]  When I was six years old, seven years old, I liked to watch PBS Frontline.
[00:09:55.066 --> 00:10:04.812]  I liked to watch long Supreme Court debates, the few that they ever televised.
[00:10:06.093 --> 00:10:10.276]  I really found how things actually work is incredibly interesting.
[00:10:12.177 --> 00:10:16.680]  But then I learned that almost no one else actually wants to study how things work.
[00:10:21.068 --> 00:10:30.313]  And that is the reason that the eugenicist, mad scientist, post-human cult are winning.
[00:10:32.754 --> 00:10:40.838]  It's because the average person reactively goes through life like a spectator and not in the arena.
[00:10:47.321 --> 00:10:47.441]  Now,
[00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:51.135]  I thought about the best way to say this, but I'm just going to get it right out there.
[00:10:53.338 --> 00:10:57.263]  I think it will be more effective to wake you up if I actually join the dark side.
[00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:11.699]  I am seriously considering completely shifting into the enemy mindset and presenting all this and just telling people world government's good and that you should kill yourselves for the earth.
[00:11:11.719 --> 00:11:22.247]  That you should sterilize yourselves and that you should make room for the great ascension and the great new evolution that is about to take place in the beautiful metamorphosis.
[00:11:24.469 --> 00:11:28.092]  And that we should be supporting Bill Gates and Prince Philip and Ted Turner.
[00:11:29.093 --> 00:11:35.216]  And the Rockefellers and the Communist Chinese because obviously they're in control, so that means they have a right to do this.
[00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:38.938]  And the public doesn't care they're slowly being killed.
[00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:42.320]  And the public doesn't care they're running giant slave camps in China.
[00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:43.881]  Apple is the worst.
[00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:45.362]  Of course they are.
[00:11:48.764 --> 00:11:52.766]  It's the purity of the classic corruption and evil with the high-tech overlay.
[00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:56.088]  Because the public
[00:11:59.587 --> 00:12:00.287]  Good people care.
[00:12:00.327 --> 00:12:01.087]  Christians care.
[00:12:01.127 --> 00:12:04.068]  That's the main group that's resisting and that see it.
[00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:21.091]  But everyone else is running headlong into it and wanting to be slaves, wanting to be slowly killed, wanting to be made unhappy, wanting to be failures because they are not meant to go into the future.
[00:12:21.411 --> 00:12:22.372]  They are meant to die.
[00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:24.172]  And that's God's plan.
[00:12:25.219 --> 00:12:28.341]  Now, Satan and the globalists are just tools in that.
[00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:30.642]  These people were given free will.
[00:12:34.264 --> 00:12:37.365]  But I guess I really shouldn't hate Bill Gates and Prince Philip and the rest of them.
[00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:45.129]  I mean, they at least are being honest and working hard to secure the future for themselves and they want to live forever.
[00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:50.672]  And they understand metaphysically that their energy is not going to be ascending
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:13:01.005]  They've sold out, but they believe they can cheat it, like Faust believed he could, and build a new system that transcends the human body.
[00:13:01.085 --> 00:13:03.306]  And so that's their holy grail, and we're to be tested on.
[00:13:03.326 --> 00:13:09.870]  And they've been promised by their God that they will transcend and be given eternal life and be gods themselves.
[00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.171]  No, you not that you are a god.
[00:13:16.054 --> 00:13:17.214]  And so that's what it is.
[00:13:18.275 --> 00:13:18.395]  And
[00:13:20.785 --> 00:13:22.466]  I'm not actually apologizing to them.
[00:13:22.686 --> 00:13:23.306]  I don't like them.
[00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:24.246]  They disgust me.
[00:13:24.707 --> 00:13:25.707]  They're completely empty.
[00:13:26.247 --> 00:13:26.987]  They are deceived.
[00:13:27.027 --> 00:13:27.728]  They are fallen.
[00:13:28.148 --> 00:13:29.468]  They are enslaved.
[00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:44.134]  But when you're on the street and a meth-head, trust fund kid walks over to you when you're walking at the park,
[00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:50.557]  with your three-year-old daughter and says, F you racist fascist, you're going to prison.
[00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:55.440]  And you look at this servant of the devil and they know that's not true.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.641]  They don't even care.
[00:13:56.761 --> 00:14:05.767]  It's about them parroting the lie while they're carrying out a system that is beyond anything Hitler could have ever even imagined.
[00:14:07.468 --> 00:14:08.629]  But he was an offshoot of it.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.502]  It's just, I'm not even mad at them.
[00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:15.603]  It's just, they're in fantasy land.
[00:14:15.643 --> 00:14:16.383]  They're losers.
[00:14:16.844 --> 00:14:17.885]  They're not the resistance.
[00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:18.905]  They're the establishment.
[00:14:19.406 --> 00:14:23.889]  And they're... I mean, I had this guy this weekend.
[00:14:24.969 --> 00:14:27.271]  Sunday, I went for a walk down at Zilker Park.
[00:14:28.011 --> 00:14:33.735]  And I'm walking along the creek there that dumps into the Colorado River.
[00:14:34.216 --> 00:14:36.457]  And I see this guy, you know, about 25,
[00:14:38.459 --> 00:14:42.141]  Kind of the academic type antifa and he's got his, you know, his beard and everything.
[00:14:43.322 --> 00:14:44.723]  And he's wearing a black top, black pants.
[00:14:44.743 --> 00:14:46.944]  But no, no antifa stuff I could see, but I could tell.
[00:14:46.964 --> 00:14:48.185]  I could see how he was looking at me.
[00:14:48.465 --> 00:14:52.668]  He looks and then he starts walking towards me at an angle like he's gonna hit me.
[00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:53.529]  Like he's gonna do something.
[00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:57.190]  And so as he starts coming towards me menacing, I just couldn't help it.
[00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:01.851]  I just instinctively started walking over, and I was getting ready to just drive his ass to the ground.
[00:15:02.071 --> 00:15:03.031]  He was stupid enough to take a swing.
[00:15:03.511 --> 00:15:09.512]  It was just instinctive that I started like a magnet coming to him, and I was gonna knock his ass down on that ground hard.
[00:15:10.652 --> 00:15:13.173]  And at the last minute, he kind of went like that and then looked scared.
[00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:15.333]  It's like, yeah, dude, this isn't Fantasy World.
[00:15:15.353 --> 00:15:16.114]  This isn't LARPing.
[00:15:16.514 --> 00:15:17.714]  You're about to get hurt bad.
[00:15:18.939 --> 00:15:20.180]  And it's the same thing across the board.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:25.043]  The globalists are killing you and your family, and they think it's funny because you never respond to it and say no.
[00:15:26.004 --> 00:15:30.727]  And it's time to start saying no, and it's time to stop backing down to these people.
[00:15:31.968 --> 00:15:33.289]  No, I'm not going to sell to the globalists.
[00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:35.010]  I am going to accelerate the war.
[00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.611]  The maximum!
[00:15:38.432 --> 00:15:42.035]  If it keeps on raining, love is gonna break.
[00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:46.278]  When the levee breaks, have no place to stay.
[00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:52.173]  Let me do this.
[00:15:53.153 --> 00:15:57.114]  Next segment, I'm gonna tell you what the globalist philosophy is.
[00:15:57.134 --> 00:16:02.156]  I think you already know as much as I do, most of you, but for new listeners, new viewers, they're really important.
[00:16:03.376 --> 00:16:05.597]  What their philosophy is, and a lot of it's true.
[00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:09.758]  A lot of what they say and do, it has a basis in logic.
[00:16:11.898 --> 00:16:13.258]  That's on the first few levels.
[00:16:14.819 --> 00:16:16.359]  And that's how they get people to sign on to it.
[00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:19.060]  But you find out, once you get a little bit deeper,
[00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:23.010]  What the real game plan is.
[00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:30.734]  And so my message is not just to the uninitiated out there that are ill-informed and don't know what's going on.
[00:16:30.754 --> 00:16:35.737]  It's not just to those of you out there that are seeking knowledge that are informed.
[00:16:36.838 --> 00:16:50.166]  It's also to the globalists because that one-tenth of one-hundredth of a percent that actually run the planet, very few of them actually know what the endgame is.
[00:16:53.393 --> 00:16:56.555]  And so I think we should really talk about what the end game is.
[00:16:57.995 --> 00:17:01.377]  Because we're about next year's news today, next decade's news today.
[00:17:03.598 --> 00:17:10.842]  And you can record this and you can save this and in that dystopic future, you won't be able to find it on the cloud or online.
[00:17:12.943 --> 00:17:19.386]  You'll have to have contraband, old devices that your smart devices will refuse to even allow to be plugged in.
[00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:22.688]  You'll have to go through a lot of hoops to even have this saved.
[00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:24.868]  So I would suggest you transcribe it.
[00:17:26.548 --> 00:17:28.129]  And in the future, you'll have to hide it.
[00:17:31.589 --> 00:17:32.290]  In the near future.
[00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.050]  They're already rolling out the military.
[00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.811]  They're already rolling out the forced inoculations.
[00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:40.851]  They're already rolling out the ID cards to get on an airplane or have a job in the UK.
[00:17:40.891 --> 00:17:41.792]  It's the model of the planet.
[00:17:42.712 --> 00:17:44.172]  China's the first beta test.
[00:17:44.472 --> 00:17:46.073]  Then the UK is always the next model.
[00:17:47.253 --> 00:17:48.193]  Germany right behind it.
[00:17:54.659 --> 00:18:09.368]  And at a certain level, I almost think I should just write a book, do maybe another year of broadcast, and then just leave, and just go to a farm, and just leave the information there, and then it's all done.
[00:18:12.844 --> 00:18:35.795]  Look, if these Democrat Party lawyers and people really want to grow up in a future where their kids are all going to die at like age 25 or so, if you really want to all be exterminated, you really want to be fried by 5G, you really want to eat GMO that leaks into your guts and gives you all the neurological disorders, if you really want this, folks, I mean, we rationalized killing all the babies, now we kill the old people, and COVID's a giant lie and they admit all that.
[00:18:39.704 --> 00:18:52.569]  They have all these computer scientists and eyewitnesses testifying at state legislatures in Arizona and in Georgia and in Pennsylvania and now in Michigan.
[00:18:54.390 --> 00:19:01.533]  And Twitter's taking down the videos of congressional testimony and legislative testimony.
[00:19:04.214 --> 00:19:06.095]  But see, we've been made comfortable.
[00:19:07.235 --> 00:19:08.196]  We've been anesthetized.
[00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:13.963]  They've been put into a trance and paralyzed.
[00:19:17.044 --> 00:19:30.971]  And now they're going to take the long enjoyable process for them of slowly sucking our entire will and future and our children's futures out of us before they kill us.
[00:19:31.972 --> 00:19:33.913]  By the time they kill us, we won't even be human anymore.
[00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:41.679]  And that's what this damn alien force, the Bible says it is, is doing.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:48.444]  And you know, it has to get us to do it to ourselves.
[00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:58.612]  And so our enemy's not the Chinese people, it's not the Russians, it's not the South Africans, it's not the Mexicans.
[00:19:59.713 --> 00:20:00.153]  It's evil.
[00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:11.814]  But evil will mobilize and will use the collapsing world to bring down what's left of the West because of our Christian ethos.
[00:20:13.335 --> 00:20:31.405]  And because we received the emergency transmission, and God literally avatared down here to hump the same dirt we have to go through, but a lot worse, to show his children that he's willing
[00:20:32.301 --> 00:20:36.724]  To do to himself what he would allow us to be going through.
[00:20:40.767 --> 00:20:41.628]  We have the transmission.
[00:20:43.249 --> 00:20:46.671]  We know exactly what old Scratch is up to.
[00:20:47.852 --> 00:20:49.213]  And now we can see it all unfolding.
[00:20:50.914 --> 00:20:56.278]  And your churches are going to tell you, they're going to be putting brain chips in kids' heads within a decade at the church.
[00:20:59.582 --> 00:21:06.424]  You're all being betrayed by all these candy ass men who aren't Christians, but want to suck off Christians.
[00:21:11.726 --> 00:21:21.129]  And you see, if you don't have the contact tracing, and you don't accept being QR coded or chipped to go to anywhere, your church will be deemed illegal.
[00:21:21.249 --> 00:21:28.531]  And they already are doing it in Europe, saying if the churches don't scan the communist Chinese QR code,
[00:21:29.977 --> 00:21:38.559]  And if you don't have that injection in your body of whatever the latest vaccine is, your church isn't authorized.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:46.101]  And then see the churches that are real aren't gonna take the nanotech injection, which is the microchipping.
[00:21:46.682 --> 00:21:58.705]  You're not injected with one microchip, you're injected with hundreds of little tiny ones that all have the same amount of data on them that a chip 10 years ago had.
[00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:05.130]  And you're saying, why don't they just spray it out of helicopters or out of planes and then we ingest it and breathe it?
[00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:09.593]  Metaphysically, they're not allowed to do that.
[00:22:12.195 --> 00:22:12.876]  Historically.
[00:22:13.756 --> 00:22:15.838]  They have to get you under pressure to do it.
[00:22:15.878 --> 00:22:18.260]  They've got to leave a way out for you on a skate patch.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.161]  But they need to force you to do it.
[00:22:21.382 --> 00:22:27.487]  It's a push, but then it becomes a shove once God removes the barrier hedge.
[00:22:29.443 --> 00:22:33.684]  And then, yes, they will put it in your water, put it in your food, put it everywhere.
[00:22:34.985 --> 00:22:42.387]  Now, the real ultimate sin here is, though, they target children before they are of age to make the discernment.
[00:22:43.447 --> 00:22:55.751]  And so that's why the Satanists are so cursed, is they cheat, and they lie to themselves, and they break the metaphysical rule that they are not allowed to hurt innocents.
[00:22:56.632 --> 00:22:57.592]  They're only allowed to get
[00:22:58.945 --> 00:23:10.260]  Adults do not support themselves and make a bad decision to receive the spiritual interdimensional transmission from Satan.
[00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:11.661]  So it's real simple.
[00:23:11.742 --> 00:23:13.404]  They're tuned into Satan's radio channel.
[00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:14.165]  They like it.
[00:23:15.162 --> 00:23:16.043]  They like being selfish.
[00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:16.903]  They like being hateful.
[00:23:16.923 --> 00:23:17.684]  They like being greedy.
[00:23:17.944 --> 00:23:18.824]  They like being stupid.
[00:23:19.125 --> 00:23:20.025]  They like being mindless.
[00:23:20.045 --> 00:23:21.566]  They like just saying everything's okay.
[00:23:21.606 --> 00:23:22.207]  Don't worry.
[00:23:22.227 --> 00:23:23.888]  Oh, we're all just going to be one.
[00:23:23.908 --> 00:23:26.610]  But you've got to be one with it.
[00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.711]  You've got to let it run you.
[00:23:28.731 --> 00:23:32.714]  And it tells you, you know, don't be tribal.
[00:23:34.568 --> 00:23:38.250]  Don't have your own group because it's gonna overwrite you.
[00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:39.690]  Of course tribes have their problems.
[00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.331]  Of course we've been manipulated with tribalism.
[00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:43.412]  Of course, in general, it's bad.
[00:23:43.532 --> 00:23:47.534]  But Christianity created a new tribalism under God where we can all unify.
[00:23:48.194 --> 00:23:51.936]  They want that tribalism out and the AI Satan grid in.
[00:23:53.616 --> 00:23:54.977]  And that's what this is, period.
[00:23:55.697 --> 00:23:56.738]  And you sign on to this?
[00:23:57.895 --> 00:24:02.978]  You are literally signing on to being in the phantom zone with these entities for eternity.
[00:24:03.699 --> 00:24:06.861]  You put yourself into hell and you throw away the key.
[00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:08.822]  I suggest you not do it.
[00:24:09.263 --> 00:24:10.864]  Got a lot of big news, a lot coming up.
[00:24:11.384 --> 00:24:12.905]  Some key intel, straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:24:14.246 --> 00:24:19.830]  All right, I said I have a message to the public, a message to the globalist, a message just to the ether.
[00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.191]  And I will get to that here in a few minutes.
[00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:25.954]  Next segment, I want to cover something really important here.
[00:24:27.222 --> 00:24:28.803]  I'm Alex Jones, your host for Just Tuned In.
[00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:32.585]  Roger Stone was with us yesterday, had some technical issues.
[00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:36.507]  He's really called what was going to happen with the election before it happened.
[00:24:37.047 --> 00:24:41.250]  There is still a clear path to victory against this fraud, but we are in desperate hours.
[00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:49.814]  He'll be popping in start of the next hour, and then at the bottom of the hour, we'll take calls for the rest of the transmission today ahead of the War Room at 3 p.m.
[00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:50.475]  with Owen Schroyer.
[00:24:51.155 --> 00:24:55.318]  And of course, band on videos where you can find all the live feeds and all the man videos.
[00:24:55.338 --> 00:25:00.061]  The globalists hope you don't watch and hope you don't research and hope above all that you don't share it.
[00:25:01.502 --> 00:25:02.723]  They hope you just lay down and take it.
[00:25:05.605 --> 00:25:19.454]  And the enemy's biggest leg up is that what they're doing is so focused, so diabolical, so over the top that people just have real trouble grasping it.
[00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:28.651]  And they project their own mindset onto the establishment.
[00:25:28.751 --> 00:25:30.052]  And people don't want to face this.
[00:25:30.092 --> 00:25:31.613]  People don't want to know the big truth.
[00:25:32.493 --> 00:25:36.716]  They think that they can just deny it and it's like a problem that's going to go away.
[00:25:37.797 --> 00:25:38.117]  It's not.
[00:25:44.922 --> 00:25:50.406]  And so the more you resist, the quicker this is going to be over with.
[00:25:52.602 --> 00:26:02.128]  We're still gonna go through the fire, but acquiescing to what's coming is going to destroy you.
[00:26:05.791 --> 00:26:18.239]  They are normalizing forced inoculations with systems of genetic, re-engineering, mutagenic,
[00:26:23.362 --> 00:26:25.502]  Cancer is cancer.
[00:26:27.143 --> 00:26:28.743]  That's what the mRNA vaccine is.
[00:26:30.164 --> 00:26:41.346]  It goes in and reprograms cells to change their overall molecular structure with artificial genetic material.
[00:26:43.667 --> 00:26:46.027]  And so it's not the body learning how to beat a virus.
[00:26:46.947 --> 00:26:49.808]  It's viruses going in and reprogramming your cells.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.021]  At the cellular level.
[00:26:56.263 --> 00:26:57.143]  I'll explain that again.
[00:26:58.204 --> 00:27:01.127]  Mike Tyson gets in the ring with his sparring partner.
[00:27:03.128 --> 00:27:06.051]  That is going to learn the technique of the guy he's going to be fighting.
[00:27:06.471 --> 00:27:12.596]  And so for six months, he trains with someone that is going to use the techniques of the fighter he's going up against.
[00:27:12.616 --> 00:27:18.401]  He'll, he'll find a sparring partner and fly him in and pay him a lot of money to be in the ring with him.
[00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.252]  So that he could train up against something like he's going to be facing later.
[00:27:26.953 --> 00:27:27.814]  That's a vaccine!
[00:27:31.877 --> 00:27:35.059]  And they've got side effects and they get contaminated and they have liability protection.
[00:27:35.659 --> 00:27:46.747]  mRNA is genetic engineering of the entire cellular system of the body.
[00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:52.173]  In a mass virus replication operation.
[00:27:57.496 --> 00:27:59.577]  It is wildly insane.
[00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:01.938]  They skip the animal trials.
[00:28:02.879 --> 00:28:04.980]  Most of the people that take it get seriously ill.
[00:28:05.641 --> 00:28:08.082]  They go, but don't worry, you'll just get fever and throw up for a few days.
[00:28:09.283 --> 00:28:10.944]  But it's what hits you later.
[00:28:12.108 --> 00:28:17.773]  Because they've already tested all of this out on humans, and they say they skipped the animal trials because they didn't.
[00:28:18.534 --> 00:28:25.180]  They did, the entire COVID family, even calling it COVID-19 two years ago, in World Bank and IMF documents.
[00:28:28.603 --> 00:28:37.851]  And they've tested it on pigs, chickens, ducks, turkeys, humans, cows, sheep, it's all there.
[00:28:42.355 --> 00:28:48.581]  And they've tested in the accelerated life cycles of these lab animals, like guinea pigs, rats, mice, they've all been tested on.
[00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:50.543]  And it's in all the patents.
[00:28:51.544 --> 00:28:54.347]  And they say in the patents, oh, by the way, this will work on humans too.
[00:28:54.367 --> 00:28:58.351]  Because they're doing it on prisoners in China.
[00:28:58.851 --> 00:28:59.712]  And that's even in the news.
[00:28:59.832 --> 00:29:05.698]  Oh, China's got unauthorized vaccines they've been using on prisoners that they're already giving people in China.
[00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:10.342]  Oh, there's black market vaccines people are buying from China.
[00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.123]  This is all insanity.
[00:29:16.466 --> 00:29:31.574]  You know, the legend of Atlantis, written about by Plato as if it was a real place, was that they had an advanced technology that allowed ships to fly in the air, that had a great pillar of white light firing up into the sky in the Atlantic Ocean, and that
[00:29:33.254 --> 00:29:37.576]  The priest at the temple did something wrong and there was a giant explosion.
[00:29:38.116 --> 00:29:39.237]  Whatever that was.
[00:29:39.917 --> 00:29:43.319]  Whether that was real or not, this is our Atlantean moment.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.023]  Thousands of labs, hundreds and hundreds of companies engaging in pure, raw research.
[00:29:54.105 --> 00:30:04.293]  Splicing plants, animals, insects, fungus together, creating whole new species of viruses and bacteria, and just releasing it insanely.
[00:30:05.894 --> 00:30:14.041]  That's the globalist religion, is everything is a giant, open-air, mad scientist laboratory.
[00:30:18.765 --> 00:30:21.327]  And the globalists believe by testing all of this on us,
[00:30:23.015 --> 00:30:40.179]  They will create crises that are so horrible that out of this will be the genesis of the new Superman, who won't be able to die from the bioweapons because he's going to be silicon, and that we will then accept those that are allowed to live, going into our new silicon bodies because it's the only way for us to, quote, survive.
[00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:43.999]  Now, I've told you for 20 years that's the Globalist's plan, reading their writings.
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.460]  Now they've externalized the method.
[00:30:48.126 --> 00:30:53.407]  And are saying it in the New York Times, the Financial Times of London, everything coming out of Davos.
[00:30:55.368 --> 00:30:59.209]  The Wall Street Journal, all these articles about looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:30:59.509 --> 00:31:01.969]  And Klaus Schwab is like, it's going to be so good for you.
[00:31:02.469 --> 00:31:04.470]  You are going to drink sewage.
[00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.090]  These are actual quotes.
[00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.491]  You're going to drink sewage and eat weeds.
[00:31:10.783 --> 00:31:14.166]  And there will not be any more people in it.
[00:31:14.266 --> 00:31:15.347]  It's good for Earth.
[00:31:16.748 --> 00:31:19.731]  Again, you will be drinking the sewage.
[00:31:20.151 --> 00:31:21.392]  He's saying this in German, by the way.
[00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:23.234]  Even though I think he is German.
[00:31:25.196 --> 00:31:28.078]  Most of his speeches are in other languages, but you can read the transcripts.
[00:31:28.138 --> 00:31:28.759]  It's in the news today.
[00:31:28.819 --> 00:31:29.579]  I'm not kidding.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.383]  Debo's group calls for drinking sewage and eating weeds.
[00:31:34.522 --> 00:31:36.064]  It's going to be wonderful.
[00:31:36.164 --> 00:31:38.366]  It's so good for you.
[00:31:38.846 --> 00:31:39.987]  You're going to like it.
[00:31:40.848 --> 00:31:41.348]  Don't read it.
[00:31:44.131 --> 00:31:46.073]  And the left goes, yes, it's our utopia.
[00:31:46.153 --> 00:31:47.895]  We want to drink sewage and eat weeds.
[00:31:49.036 --> 00:31:50.277]  You see, it's a Stockholm syndrome.
[00:31:50.817 --> 00:31:54.581]  It's like, like the pimp says, look what I can make them do.
[00:31:57.063 --> 00:31:58.705]  Now, I've talked a lot about this.
[00:32:01.459 --> 00:32:02.800]  I've already burned through this segment.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.261]  I haven't got any of the clips I want to get to.
[00:32:04.281 --> 00:32:07.523]  We'll cover all the election fraud and that nightmare and where that's going next hour.
[00:32:11.105 --> 00:32:16.328]  But everybody's flipping out about this video that's up on InfoWars.com from last night.
[00:32:16.348 --> 00:32:17.489]  We should probably repost the article.
[00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:25.054]  But a COVID prediction from Project Runway in March of last year.
[00:32:26.414 --> 00:32:27.035]  So a full
[00:32:30.796 --> 00:32:35.679]  Ten, eleven months before it was even named that, or on the radar.
[00:32:36.139 --> 00:32:44.784]  But again, where do the globalists like to put stuff in fashion, and in movies, and in culture?
[00:32:44.824 --> 00:32:50.848]  They want to tell you, like some serial killers will do that.
[00:32:51.568 --> 00:32:53.029]  The Native Americans will do it, like Counting Coup.
[00:32:55.199 --> 00:32:59.740]  They'll leave a card in your mailbox and tell you what they're going to do to you before they do it.
[00:32:59.861 --> 00:33:01.281]  That sweetens it.
[00:33:01.841 --> 00:33:03.242]  That gives them the real enjoyment.
[00:33:04.242 --> 00:33:08.023]  So I thought we'd talk about that and then have my little message to the globalists when we come back.
[00:33:08.043 --> 00:33:12.385]  And then I think the globalists already know they're deceived.
[00:33:12.765 --> 00:33:13.305]  They like it.
[00:33:14.385 --> 00:33:15.746]  So I even have a message for them.
[00:33:16.166 --> 00:33:17.066]  They already know, don't they?
[00:33:18.827 --> 00:33:19.927]  How do you like me now?
[00:33:21.128 --> 00:33:22.068]  How do you like me now?
[00:33:23.345 --> 00:33:24.345]  Oh, you like me now?
[00:33:24.405 --> 00:33:25.646]  That's what Bill Gates is saying to us.
[00:33:28.086 --> 00:33:28.806]  We are back.
[00:33:28.966 --> 00:33:30.107]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.107 --> 00:33:33.767]  Roger Stone's coming up for 30 minutes on the election.
[00:33:34.208 --> 00:33:35.248]  There's a lot of news on it.
[00:33:36.408 --> 00:33:37.348]  And then your calls.
[00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.110]  Let me just get this out of the way right now.
[00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:52.572]  Infowars has been over the target our entire history.
[00:33:54.605 --> 00:34:02.427]  Because the technocrats running this show have all written books and treatises on their plan.
[00:34:04.467 --> 00:34:09.108]  It's just the general public doesn't like to read big, long white papers.
[00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:12.349]  And when you do read it, it's so horrible.
[00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:19.450]  Who would believe stuff written in the 60s that they would effectively get rid of families and
[00:34:20.987 --> 00:34:26.748]  Had children by age five, sterilized by the state as part of a trendy sex change.
[00:34:27.408 --> 00:34:27.969]  But we're here.
[00:34:28.769 --> 00:34:36.210]  And that was written about in the 1960s by the top psychiatrists and psychologists that were producing this post-human plant.
[00:34:39.611 --> 00:34:44.972]  You see, the decision was made before World War II to set up the League of Nations to stop all war.
[00:34:45.312 --> 00:34:47.933]  And then, of course, they engineered a bigger war to bring in the UN.
[00:34:49.855 --> 00:34:55.500]  And the argument is, we have to end war and end all the tragedies we've seen before.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.722]  To do that, we've got to end the human community as we know it.
[00:34:59.783 --> 00:35:01.785]  We have to end men and women as we know it.
[00:35:02.565 --> 00:35:10.192]  And we have to have servile, corporately created creatures that are hatched at what are called hatcheries.
[00:35:13.223 --> 00:35:18.864]  That was in 1932, started writing the book in 1929.
[00:35:19.805 --> 00:35:20.485]  Aldous Huxley.
[00:35:20.745 --> 00:35:22.285]  Again, I just keep giving you that one example.
[00:35:23.005 --> 00:35:28.867]  He later again wrote the book in 61, Brave New World Revisited, where he said, this is not fiction.
[00:35:30.527 --> 00:35:37.629]  This is the stratagem plan that we'd like to have implemented somewhere around the year 2030.
[00:35:45.632 --> 00:35:49.595]  Now, you might want to go see if that's true.
[00:35:50.056 --> 00:35:51.096]  You might want to go read that book.
[00:35:51.517 --> 00:35:53.098]  You might want to find out I'm not lying to you.
[00:35:53.138 --> 00:35:55.720]  These people are already slowly murdering you.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:06.469]  They're murdering me with all their electromagnetic radiation, with their GMOs, and now they're coming with inoculations that they admit change your entire genetic code.
[00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.771]  And that's day one.
[00:36:13.919 --> 00:36:29.271]  Do you understand this is a 200-year plan set up by Galton and the British royalty, who are not British.
[00:36:31.253 --> 00:36:37.758]  They are the literal offspring of Vlad the Impaler.
[00:36:38.159 --> 00:36:40.761]  And again, why do you think Bram Stoker wrote Dracula?
[00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:48.836]  Where there's a guy in Transylvania at a castle, and he takes babies in to his women, and they drink the blood of the babies.
[00:36:49.357 --> 00:36:50.297]  That's Black Sabbath.
[00:36:58.302 --> 00:37:01.004]  He told you in that book who they are.
[00:37:01.024 --> 00:37:07.388]  Now their bodies die, but the spirit that inhabits the family, the dragon, is real.
[00:37:09.169 --> 00:37:11.290]  And they drink blood.
[00:37:15.131 --> 00:37:17.633]  Prince Charles doesn't even live in the UK anymore.
[00:37:17.993 --> 00:37:36.228]  He spends six months out of the year where he moved back in to Dracula Castle, where he can quote, spend time with the local orphanage children that visit him and some that live at the castle with him.
[00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:38.650]  Look it up.
[00:37:40.772 --> 00:37:42.814]  So when you wonder why they're doing all this,
[00:37:45.322 --> 00:37:57.494]  Because a dude that lives in Dracula's castle and who is the direct descendant of Count Dragon wants to hurt you.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.102]  And our country broke away from this.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.481]  By the way, you know there's paintings of Count Dracula.
[00:38:15.202 --> 00:38:16.643]  Spitting image of Prince Charles.
[00:38:17.403 --> 00:38:22.326]  So see, I could say a lot, I could do a lot here, but just, you need to understand what you're up against.
[00:38:22.966 --> 00:38:26.649]  Blood drinking, child killing, pedophile murderers.
[00:38:31.452 --> 00:38:39.717]  So, you can either fight them, or you can roll over and die to them.
[00:38:42.073 --> 00:38:47.815]  But he wants to put his genetics into your blood.
[00:38:47.895 --> 00:38:49.316]  He wants to defile you.
[00:38:50.396 --> 00:38:55.998]  He wants to put his material into your cells and overwrite your cell, cell by cell.
[00:38:56.478 --> 00:39:00.419]  It's not a flying saucer crashed out in Antarctica in the movie The Thing.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.301]  It's coming out of a Chinese laboratory.
[00:39:09.102 --> 00:39:10.283]  It's not the movie The Hunger.
[00:39:12.267 --> 00:39:17.069]  They look under the microscope and they see the vampire cell taking over the other cell.
[00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:20.950]  It's not a David Bowie movie.
[00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:22.510]  Excellent film, by the way.
[00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:26.432]  It's the real world, boys and girls.
[00:39:28.972 --> 00:39:31.613]  I want to hit two things here in a moment, but let me just do this.
[00:39:33.534 --> 00:39:34.794]  I need money to fight this war.
[00:39:35.414 --> 00:39:37.215]  I see money as literal energy.
[00:39:39.827 --> 00:39:42.849]  And I've never sold out one of my values for a nickel.
[00:39:43.629 --> 00:39:47.131]  I've done it the original way, through free will, with your support.
[00:39:47.751 --> 00:39:50.953]  But I need a lot more money to fight this war properly.
[00:39:51.353 --> 00:39:53.294]  I don't like running this operation on empty.
[00:39:54.935 --> 00:39:57.736]  And if the money ever stops coming at the level we need, that's just the way it is.
[00:39:59.097 --> 00:40:07.221]  But I need listeners to understand that there's nowhere you can spend your money where it's going to go into the fight against tyranny like it is here.
[00:40:08.562 --> 00:40:08.802]  Nowhere.
[00:40:11.328 --> 00:40:16.035]  And we've got the best fish oil, the best grill oil, the best PQQ CoQ10.
[00:40:16.055 --> 00:40:17.396]  You don't know what that does.
[00:40:17.436 --> 00:40:20.220]  It cleans up your cells, your telomeres, regrows nerves.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.142]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:40:22.284 --> 00:40:27.527]  The globalists are trying to turn them into a drug like they did a lot of other products we used to sell.
[00:40:27.607 --> 00:40:33.031]  Our original Brain Force, you know, had stuff that they now made into a drug to treat Alzheimer's.
[00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:34.212]  It's totally healthy and good for you.
[00:40:34.412 --> 00:40:36.773]  They just took a normal deal and, you know, made it illegal for us to sell.
[00:40:37.774 --> 00:40:49.782]  But, I mean, that's just an example of how good things are we have in DNA Force Plus and in Ultra 12 and the patented ingredients that are in Alpha Power back in stock.
[00:40:51.497 --> 00:40:52.978]  And I've painted myself into a corner.
[00:40:52.998 --> 00:40:56.621]  Now look at that, 99% reviews, 4.9 stars.
[00:40:59.244 --> 00:41:01.065]  On the DNA Force, 100% on the Krill.
[00:41:02.386 --> 00:41:06.069]  I mean, this Krill is the most expensive, best Krill we could find.
[00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.251]  And then we just don't put a big markup on it.
[00:41:08.331 --> 00:41:10.834]  It's just insane at the price we've got.
[00:41:11.823 --> 00:41:14.184]  I mean, I can buy a bottle of crap krill.
[00:41:14.204 --> 00:41:15.124]  It's not even real krill.
[00:41:15.144 --> 00:41:18.025]  It's like boiled down and reduced skeleton with the krill.
[00:41:18.505 --> 00:41:21.967]  It still has great effects for your blood pressure, your body, your skin, everything.
[00:41:21.987 --> 00:41:24.588]  I mean, I can buy a bottle of that for $3 a bottle.
[00:41:25.888 --> 00:41:26.428]  But we don't.
[00:41:26.448 --> 00:41:32.250]  Depending on how much of it I order, it costs us between, what, $10 and $13 a bottle.
[00:41:34.389 --> 00:41:36.450]  Everybody else, you know, would charge.
[00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:40.511]  I mean, medical places, you know, have it, because people know they'll pay more with a doctor.
[00:41:40.751 --> 00:41:42.511]  Same krill, 100 bucks a bottle.
[00:41:43.712 --> 00:41:45.352]  And the doctor's paying 10 bucks a bottle for it.
[00:41:46.032 --> 00:41:49.573]  So, I mean, that's just an example of what we have at infowarestore.com.
[00:41:50.854 --> 00:41:53.234]  And I painted myself in a corner where we're always having sales.
[00:41:53.254 --> 00:41:54.354]  People only buy when there's a sale.
[00:41:54.975 --> 00:41:56.275]  So we got sales going all the time.
[00:41:58.055 --> 00:42:00.316]  And then people stop selling unless the sale gets bigger and bigger.
[00:42:00.356 --> 00:42:03.437]  And then there's no money in there to fund our operation.
[00:42:06.638 --> 00:42:08.740]  So, again, these are great products.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:09.340]  You need them.
[00:42:10.781 --> 00:42:11.762]  Sign up for AutoShip.

[00:42:49.135 --> 00:42:50.136]  When you check out.
[00:42:50.957 --> 00:42:52.038]  Also, don't forget.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:43:02.146]  We have the charcoal toothpaste that's super high quality and concentrated that is amazing that we had in the pipeline for about a year and a half before we even started selling.
[00:43:02.166 --> 00:43:06.468]  People said, well, you stopped selling your super blue and your whitening toothpaste.
[00:43:06.488 --> 00:43:15.594]  Yeah, because the national media lied and said that I said it was a COVID cure and tried to get me arrested and had the FDA come after us and everything.
[00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:29.219]  The problem is if I sell it, they'll lie again and say he's selling a cure, and then all these people flood in to buy it thinking it's a cure, because they're saying it's a cure, and then they try to get affidavits from them thinking they bought a cure to indict me.
[00:43:30.019 --> 00:43:31.521]  That's why we don't have that available for you.
[00:43:31.841 --> 00:43:35.504]  Because of the criminal activity of the Democratic Party and Letitia James in New York.
[00:43:35.544 --> 00:43:40.288]  I mean, these are savage mafia dons that murder old people in nursing homes on purpose.
[00:43:40.328 --> 00:43:41.829]  I mean, I'm up against murderers.
[00:43:42.329 --> 00:43:43.210]  These are murderers.
[00:43:44.191 --> 00:43:44.651]  Seriously.
[00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:45.272]  We'll be right back.

[00:44:49.973 --> 00:44:53.578]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[00:44:54.038 --> 00:45:02.128]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms, glued to their televisions, too terrified to skip the commercials.
[00:45:02.548 --> 00:45:06.132]  Well, I think... NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[00:45:07.554 --> 00:45:09.456]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care.
[00:45:09.697 --> 00:45:09.877]  Yeah.
[00:45:11.255 --> 00:45:11.896]  A new disease.
[00:45:12.156 --> 00:45:12.776]  No one's immune.
[00:45:13.096 --> 00:45:16.359]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[00:45:16.539 --> 00:45:18.260]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:23.124]  Now I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[00:45:23.144 --> 00:45:24.725]  He loves being that guy.
[00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:27.247]  But Janice, we do have standards.
[00:45:27.467 --> 00:45:29.168]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[00:45:29.428 --> 00:45:33.751]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:37.374]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[00:45:37.694 --> 00:45:38.435]  Get over here, NBC.
[00:45:40.756 --> 00:45:44.118]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh.
[00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:46.899]  Wow.
[00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:47.859]  Wow.
[00:45:48.379 --> 00:45:48.900]  Oh, yeah.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.800]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[00:45:51.201 --> 00:45:55.462]  Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[00:45:55.642 --> 00:45:58.063]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[00:45:58.444 --> 00:46:00.745]  House cat flu is coming, people.
[00:46:00.925 --> 00:46:08.328]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[00:46:10.103 --> 00:46:15.745]  So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender fiddles.
[00:46:22.167 --> 00:46:26.809]  Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following symptoms.
[00:46:27.089 --> 00:46:30.090]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[00:46:35.051 --> 00:46:36.212]  It's never gonna get any better.
[00:46:36.232 --> 00:46:37.352]  Don't look for it.
[00:46:37.752 --> 00:46:38.873]  Be happy with what you got.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.081]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:45.282]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[00:46:45.662 --> 00:46:46.722]  The real owners.
[00:46:46.782 --> 00:46:51.323]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[00:46:51.703 --> 00:46:52.944]  Forget the politicians.
[00:46:53.164 --> 00:46:56.425]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[00:46:58.005 --> 00:46:58.466]  You don't.
[00:46:59.226 --> 00:47:00.206]  You have no choice.
[00:47:00.586 --> 00:47:01.526]  You have owners.
[00:47:01.827 --> 00:47:02.747]  They own you.
[00:47:04.093 --> 00:47:05.374]  They own everything.
[00:47:05.615 --> 00:47:07.256]  They own all the important land.
[00:47:07.617 --> 00:47:09.379]  They own and control the corporations.
[00:47:09.399 --> 00:47:12.882]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[00:47:12.902 --> 00:47:14.464]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[00:47:14.804 --> 00:47:19.610]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.432]  They got you by the balls!
[00:47:22.918 --> 00:47:25.018]  They want obedient workers.
[00:47:25.459 --> 00:47:26.959]  Obedient workers.
[00:47:27.279 --> 00:47:39.962]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[00:47:40.042 --> 00:47:43.303]  And now they're coming for your social security money.
[00:47:43.763 --> 00:47:46.423]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[00:47:47.824 --> 00:47:48.764]  It's a big club.
[00:47:49.727 --> 00:47:50.427]  And you ain't in it.
[00:47:50.708 --> 00:47:56.091]  And you said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[00:47:56.431 --> 00:47:57.312]  You better believe it.
[00:47:57.412 --> 00:47:59.293]  So what specifically did they do?
[00:47:59.734 --> 00:48:04.897]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[00:48:05.117 --> 00:48:05.737]  A lot of money.
[00:48:06.358 --> 00:48:09.060]  You and I are not in the big club.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.361]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[00:48:12.001 --> 00:48:15.704]  It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[00:48:17.128 --> 00:48:18.608]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[00:48:18.988 --> 00:48:22.449]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[00:48:22.489 --> 00:48:26.410]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:27.391]  They're not interested in that.
[00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:28.611]  That doesn't help them.
[00:48:28.991 --> 00:48:30.351]  That's against their interest.
[00:48:30.851 --> 00:48:31.292]  That's right.
[00:48:31.552 --> 00:48:36.593]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48:46.544 --> 00:48:47.985]  Do you mind putting your mask back on?
[00:48:48.285 --> 00:48:48.745]  Thank you.
[00:48:49.206 --> 00:48:52.608]  I had not noticed COVID's detail.
[00:48:52.648 --> 00:48:54.749]  This 3D applique.
[00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:56.210]  I mean, it just gets better.
[00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:57.551]  What do you guys think of this mask?
[00:48:57.991 --> 00:48:59.432]  It's sick.
[00:48:59.612 --> 00:49:00.453]  But you must be hot.
[00:49:00.573 --> 00:49:01.713]  You should probably take it off.
[00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:03.174]  I loved COVID's look.
[00:49:04.215 --> 00:49:05.716]  Do you mind putting your mask back on?
[00:49:06.037 --> 00:49:06.597]  Thank you.
[00:49:06.957 --> 00:49:12.442]  I had not noticed COVID's detailed 3D applique.
[00:49:12.903 --> 00:49:14.064]  I mean, it just gets better.
[00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:15.305]  What do you guys think of this mask?
[00:49:15.745 --> 00:49:17.146]  It's sick.
[00:49:17.367 --> 00:49:18.187]  But you must be hot.
[00:49:18.307 --> 00:49:19.689]  You should probably take the mask off.
[00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:30.258]  The model's name, just for this event in March of last year, 10-11 months before COVID-19 even was given a name, before they even supposedly knew it was coming,
[00:49:32.629 --> 00:49:49.174]  On national, international television for Project Runway, a woman wearing a mask and a type of weird Red Cross medical outfit named COVID Kapoor.
[00:49:51.474 --> 00:49:52.414]  Why do they do this?
[00:49:52.674 --> 00:49:59.176]  Well, why did the Simpsons talk about how they create artificial virus scares to keep us locked in our homes 15 years ago?
[00:50:00.257 --> 00:50:01.437]  Why did Operation Lockstep
[00:50:02.401 --> 00:50:05.543]  Put out by the Rockefellers.
[00:50:08.565 --> 00:50:12.688]  Why did they say they would do all this?
[00:50:12.768 --> 00:50:15.430]  Because they're throwing it in your face.
[00:50:16.571 --> 00:50:25.638]  Klaus Schwab said five years ago, a year ago, eight months ago, and last week, that COVID's not a threat.
[00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:31.534]  That he said years ago, a virus will be used, it's not really a threat, but it will bring the world together.
[00:50:32.014 --> 00:50:38.679]  He's even saying, don't worry, a virus is coming, but to the insiders, it's not a big threat, it's not existential, we will survive it.
[00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:42.782]  Because you tell the inner cult, you're going to be fine.
[00:50:44.163 --> 00:50:47.746]  But we're going to use this to take all their liberties and then depopulate them and save the earth.
[00:50:50.168 --> 00:50:55.272]  Remember, in the 60s and 70s, they wrote books like Ecoscience, a political
[00:50:58.433 --> 00:51:08.879]  Analysis of the world, written by Obama's science czar, and other depopulationists like Paul Ehrlich and his wife.
[00:51:12.562 --> 00:51:17.845]  And in eco-science, in fact, I think it's in the radio producer office over there, somebody will get it for me.
[00:51:18.225 --> 00:51:19.446]  It's a big white book, big textbook.
[00:51:21.347 --> 00:51:24.128]  They talk about fluoride in the water, lower your fertility, lower your IQ.
[00:51:25.472 --> 00:51:29.435]  They talk about using forced inoculations in the future to lower your population.
[00:51:29.735 --> 00:51:33.657]  But hell, I could just play Bill Gates saying it ten years ago at TED Talk.
[00:51:34.778 --> 00:51:35.799]  Would you like me to do that?
[00:51:40.742 --> 00:51:50.849]  You see, this is how they get to be the savior of the Earth and tell their people in the 60s and 70s, we're going to reduce the world population by half.
[00:51:52.398 --> 00:51:59.061]  But then by 1980, 40 years ago, Ted Turner builds the Georgia Guidestones and says, I want an 80% reduction.
[00:52:01.783 --> 00:52:03.584]  That was the number back then to 500 million.
[00:52:04.644 --> 00:52:07.066]  Well, look at his new quotes.
[00:52:08.186 --> 00:52:11.228]  A total population of 250 to 30 million people, a 95% decline for present levels would be ideal.
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:26.083]  But as you get deeper into all of this, they say, you know, it's not 95%.
[00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:28.444]  Humans are a parasite.
[00:52:28.504 --> 00:52:29.185]  We're bad.
[00:52:29.265 --> 00:52:29.945]  We're fallen.
[00:52:31.406 --> 00:52:35.388]  We have to merge with machines and have a zero carbon footprint.
[00:52:36.388 --> 00:52:37.789]  See, carbon bad, people bad.
[00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:38.929]  People bad wear a mask.
[00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:44.072]  And here's what David Rockefeller had to say.
[00:52:44.412 --> 00:52:48.334]  The negative impact of population growth on all of our planetary ecosystems
[00:52:49.451 --> 00:52:50.892]  It's becoming appallingly evident.
[00:52:52.513 --> 00:52:55.355]  Meanwhile, that they're the ones with all the genetic engineering and the rest of it ruining the planet.
[00:52:57.236 --> 00:53:01.579]  And you read their deeper literature, they say, oh, we're just going to overwrite the whole planet.
[00:53:01.599 --> 00:53:02.940]  We'll build hundreds of planets that we want.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.981]  We're going to just be gods.
[00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:08.043]  So they tell the underlings, oh, we're going to kill everybody for the Earth.
[00:53:08.123 --> 00:53:10.025]  Yes, but you'll be allowed to survive.
[00:53:10.899 --> 00:53:11.860]  We're only gonna kill 50%.
[00:53:12.641 --> 00:53:13.622]  Well, it's actually 80.
[00:53:14.162 --> 00:53:15.323]  Well, it's actually 95.
[00:53:15.523 --> 00:53:18.286]  And then we just sit here, oh, Alex, cover the election fraud.
[00:53:18.566 --> 00:53:20.708]  Oh, Alex, cover, you know, this or that.
[00:53:20.828 --> 00:53:22.730]  It's all this operation.
[00:53:24.231 --> 00:53:27.855]  Break New World is chemically sterilizing little boys.
[00:53:28.115 --> 00:53:29.276]  They wrote the book in 1932.
[00:53:29.316 --> 00:53:32.979]  It's published.
[00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:47.215]  And the authors, whose brother ran the UN program on eugenics, was the head of the World Eugenics Society, and founded transhumanism, said, this is our plan for you.
[00:53:48.195 --> 00:53:51.138]  George Orwell is a lightweight.
[00:53:51.178 --> 00:53:52.699]  We won't need police in the future.
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:54:02.707]  It won't be a boot-stopping on the head forever, because you're going to be chemically altered and genetically altered from birth to be a corporate product, and you will love your slavery.
[00:54:11.513 --> 00:54:17.035]  And the average trust fund, two degrees in the bank, no job.
[00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:25.778]  And if a member literally loves three million Muslims in death camps in China, loves millions of Christians in death camps and Buddhists.
[00:54:26.518 --> 00:54:32.180]  And if you say to them, you're not the moral authority calling us racist when you're involved in all this evil.
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.040]  And they don't care.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:34.841]  They like it.
[00:54:35.081 --> 00:54:36.141]  They like it's all a lie.
[00:54:36.181 --> 00:54:37.121]  They like it's a fraud.
[00:54:37.442 --> 00:54:38.602]  They're into evil.
[00:54:41.465 --> 00:54:44.006]  And that's why they admit all of this to everyone.
[00:54:44.487 --> 00:54:45.467]  Let's read a Bill Gates quote.
[00:54:45.527 --> 00:54:46.788]  I mean, I could show you the video.
[00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:50.710]  The world has 6.8 billion people.
[00:54:51.571 --> 00:54:53.252]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:54:53.952 --> 00:55:02.877]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 to 15 percent.
[00:55:05.098 --> 00:55:06.219]  What the hell do you think that means?
[00:55:09.653 --> 00:55:11.213]  And then I've got stacks of news.
[00:55:12.354 --> 00:55:13.734]  This person died from a shot.
[00:55:13.794 --> 00:55:14.854]  This person got paralyzed.
[00:55:15.114 --> 00:55:19.015]  Oh, 10,000 kids got narcolepsy and, you know, and a bunch of them died.
[00:55:19.035 --> 00:55:24.536]  It's just, oh, 59 died in one city where they gave the flu shot in South Korea, but they're not stopping.
[00:55:28.136 --> 00:55:30.037]  You're like, wait a minute, they've been caught doing this.
[00:55:30.417 --> 00:55:31.857]  Now the vaccines are even worse?
[00:55:32.217 --> 00:55:32.757]  Exactly.
[00:55:33.617 --> 00:55:36.278]  Because now everybody's censored off Facebook and Twitter.
[00:55:37.785 --> 00:55:41.267]  Mainline doctors go on there and talk about vaccines and how they're hurting people.
[00:55:41.307 --> 00:55:53.193]  And I mean, my dad, before he retired, as an oral surgeon and a dentist, knew all these old people that would follow whatever they were told by their medical doctor.
[00:55:53.593 --> 00:56:00.817]  So they all went out and got shingles, which is really just another type of herpes.
[00:56:02.165 --> 00:56:09.230]  They went and got the herpes vaccine, and then they all would, almost all of his patients would get super sick that took it, and a bunch of them died!
[00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:13.513]  In the same year, he knew a bunch of patients that died!
[00:56:13.533 --> 00:56:27.223]  And they'd come to him to get a tooth worked on, with their legs bandaged, blood running out, going, I took the shot two weeks ago, and now I've got shingles, and I'm... And then a week later, they're dead!
[00:56:33.459 --> 00:56:37.821]  And they have articles, oh, woman claims husband got neurological damage from COVID vaccine.
[00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:55.050]  If you research muscular sclerosis and lesions on your spine and nervous system, it's in all the studies and literature that it 100% can be triggered by an autoimmune response from a vaccine.
[00:56:59.572 --> 00:57:02.334]  And again, there's this local talk show host that attacks me all the time.
[00:57:16.209 --> 00:57:18.471]  He's always Alex Jones is this, Alex Jones is that.
[00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:19.873]  And then he went and got a flu shot.
[00:57:20.613 --> 00:57:21.875]  This is like 10 years ago now.
[00:57:23.256 --> 00:57:27.120]  And his feet and hands got totally numb for a few weeks.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.742]  And for a while his feet were partially paralyzed.
[00:57:30.022 --> 00:57:35.127]  And the doctor told him, you got Guillain-Barre from it.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:40.542]  And he goes, yeah, Alex Jones is right, but still, it's worth it to not get the flu.
[00:57:41.103 --> 00:57:46.045]  Just like they say in England, oh, we've approved all these vaccines that didn't even do proper approval, causing all these problems.
[00:57:46.366 --> 00:57:49.928]  And they go, the good outweighs the harm they'll cause.
[00:57:51.569 --> 00:57:57.652]  You watch drug ads all the time on TV, and most of them say, by the way, don't take this if you've recently been vaccinated.
[00:57:59.213 --> 00:57:59.573]  Why?
[00:58:00.834 --> 00:58:01.114]  Because
[00:58:02.586 --> 00:58:06.487]  It savages your immune system and causes all sorts of problems.
[00:58:06.547 --> 00:58:08.728]  And there's other things they're adding to it.
[00:58:10.388 --> 00:58:15.069]  You know, I knew I was right about the New World Order from their own quotes, their own books, their own writings.
[00:58:15.089 --> 00:58:21.771]  I mean, I spent decades reading their books, reading their writings, just not believing how crazy they were, how evil they were.
[00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:26.392]  And I figured we'd warn people and folks would rally against it and stop it.
[00:58:26.472 --> 00:58:30.633]  But because they carry out their takeover incrementally,
[00:58:32.412 --> 00:58:41.860]  It's become very, very hard for people to really face how much trouble they're in.
[00:58:43.281 --> 00:58:50.507]  The average man is very prideful and selfish and doesn't want to admit that they're a slave.
[00:58:53.930 --> 00:59:01.356]  And the average woman is very trusting to the system and has been trained to not trust her family or her husband.
[00:59:02.466 --> 00:59:04.747]  That it's a virtue to not even have a family.
[00:59:05.528 --> 00:59:10.611]  And so every good attribute of women and every good attribute of men has been bred out of us.
[00:59:12.532 --> 00:59:19.997]  And we have been made into a world of infantile, lazy fools.
[00:59:23.078 --> 00:59:27.241]  And I don't come up here and say those negative things to be just a buzzkill here.
[00:59:28.988 --> 00:59:35.010]  When I say these things, three of my fingers are pointing right back at me because I know my problems.
[00:59:35.170 --> 00:59:35.990]  I know who I am.
[00:59:37.531 --> 00:59:40.211]  But this is the planetary takeover.
[00:59:40.372 --> 00:59:47.574]  This is the operation that will make Hitler look like an amateur.
[00:59:51.035 --> 00:59:51.335]  And so,
[00:59:52.847 --> 00:59:54.848]  I know some broadcasts, I just get up here and I repeat that.
[00:59:54.868 --> 00:59:57.229]  I've got hundreds of incredible articles, very interesting things to cover.
[00:59:57.589 --> 01:00:01.050]  But all of it's kind of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic and polishing silverware.
[01:00:02.531 --> 01:00:03.972]  I mean, there is a world government.
[01:00:04.432 --> 01:00:08.834]  It's censoring medical doctors and scientists that come out and say, Cub was an overblown hoax.
[01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:12.314]  When that's true, by the way, but they still have their speech.
[01:00:12.955 --> 01:00:23.624]  And now they're censoring Rudolph Giuliani and eyewitnesses that have signed sworn affidavits in the legislatures before the committees.
[01:00:25.466 --> 01:00:28.509]  They don't want you to see what's happening in the legislative court.
[01:00:33.773 --> 01:00:34.474]  And we put up with it.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.041]  Oh, that's the private company!
[01:00:38.341 --> 01:00:43.463]  That's the modern communication system, is the internet.
[01:00:45.644 --> 01:01:01.070]  And when the legislature has a Twitter account, and they've got a feed on there, and Twitter blocks that, that's like cutting the phone lines when an enemy army rolls in, or blowing up the radio station.
[01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:05.192]  I mean, they've cut our damn communications.
[01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:34.626]  And by the time Congress figures it out, because they're a bunch of stuffed suit, arrogant lawyers that don't even know how to balance their checkbook, that don't cook their own meals, that go play golf and have sex with their mistresses all day, that's the one that aren't screwing kids, and they're just in another world bought off for chicken feed while the technocrats sit back coldly.
[01:01:36.772 --> 01:01:42.238]  Planning the end of the species and the rise of the new silicon humanoid.
[01:01:45.461 --> 01:01:47.383]  And I just sit here going, this is unbelievable.
[01:01:53.561 --> 01:02:07.649]  But I'm telling you, man, you get around those senators and congressmen and women, they're so, oh, there in the elite, oh, they strut around enjoying, you know, just, oh, and they're so empty, there's nothing there.
[01:02:11.631 --> 01:02:14.353]  And their own children will die before they die.
[01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:18.224]  In most cases that, I mean, this is all going to move very quick now.
[01:02:18.804 --> 01:02:25.668]  The beta testing with the autism from one in 30,000 to one in 58, now it's going to be one in three within 10 years or less.
[01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:28.570]  That's estimated.
[01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:36.374]  In 2030, in nine years, it's estimated that one in three in South Korea, boys will have autism.
[01:02:37.655 --> 01:02:38.435]  One in five here.
[01:02:41.897 --> 01:02:42.638]  And then it gets worse.
[01:02:47.284 --> 01:02:48.205]  That's just a start.
[01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:55.492]  So, remember that.
[01:02:56.513 --> 01:03:05.622]  Oh, but there's the headlines, the military is preparing in the UK and in Germany to go after anti-vax militants.
[01:03:07.344 --> 01:03:08.265]  That's pure intimidation.
[01:03:08.665 --> 01:03:10.687]  And then they come out a week ago and say, oh,
[01:03:11.752 --> 01:03:20.336]  The government says, we're going to make you have an ID pass if you've had a vaccine to go to a movie theater or a gas station or a grocery store and have a job.
[01:03:20.636 --> 01:03:24.759]  And then the central government goes, well, we're not sure we'll do that.
[01:03:25.079 --> 01:03:30.341]  And then they already had rolled it out in Wales and other areas.
[01:03:31.782 --> 01:03:33.403]  Already rolled it out in the Welsh Highlands.
[01:03:36.092 --> 01:03:36.632]  It's already there.
[01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:37.853]  Let's see they go.
[01:03:37.893 --> 01:03:38.754]  Hey, we're gonna make you do this.
[01:03:38.834 --> 01:03:39.314]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:03:39.334 --> 01:03:41.936]  We're not so you never resist like we're gonna do it.
[01:03:42.077 --> 01:03:43.578]  Oh, no, we're not and then yeah, we are.
[01:03:43.758 --> 01:03:44.679]  It's a psychological effect.
[01:03:45.079 --> 01:03:45.719]  We're attacking.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.781]  Oh, no, we're not and then you go.
[01:03:47.801 --> 01:03:52.124]  Oh, that's a classic basic psychology move this default.
[01:03:52.504 --> 01:03:53.325]  Everything's deception.
[01:03:53.765 --> 01:03:54.486]  Everything's lies.
[01:03:54.846 --> 01:03:58.249]  Everything's hate and you listen to this Mark Zucker call.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.721]  Project Veritas recordings on it.
[01:04:01.781 --> 01:04:03.963]  Don't expect politicians to ever be truthful.
[01:04:04.043 --> 01:04:05.464]  Lying is just the way things are.
[01:04:05.504 --> 01:04:07.126]  And he's talking about himself there.
[01:04:07.146 --> 01:04:16.813]  And it's just people that have broken the social contract with themselves, with God, and with everyone around them.
[01:04:17.794 --> 01:04:22.698]  Horribly empty, sniveling, rat-like creatures.
[01:04:25.899 --> 01:04:27.420]  Who are in love with themselves.
[01:04:27.861 --> 01:04:29.482]  Look at the photo of Jeff Zucker.
[01:04:30.242 --> 01:04:31.343]  Looks just like Brian Stelter.
[01:04:32.504 --> 01:04:32.964]  Look at his eye.
[01:04:32.984 --> 01:04:34.626]  He's so in love with himself.
[01:04:35.006 --> 01:04:36.767]  Just, oh, he's so satisfied.
[01:04:37.408 --> 01:04:39.089]  Oh, they drive him in a limo.
[01:04:39.149 --> 01:04:41.131]  And, oh, he makes millions of dollars.
[01:04:41.171 --> 01:04:42.151]  And, oh, he's Jeff Zucker.
[01:04:42.332 --> 01:04:43.132]  He's a joke.
[01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:47.796]  By the way, he knows he's a joke.
[01:04:50.498 --> 01:04:51.519]  A smug nobody.
[01:04:52.506 --> 01:04:53.927]  And that's why he wants to bring you down.
[01:04:54.648 --> 01:04:57.890]  He hates you when you have a good Christmas.
[01:04:58.291 --> 01:05:00.252]  He hates it when you raise your children good.
[01:05:00.492 --> 01:05:01.954]  He hates you when you pray to God.
[01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:05.296]  He hates you because you've got a wonderful life and children.
[01:05:05.597 --> 01:05:12.402]  He will never be a good person because he is a filthy, degenerate sack of evil.
[01:05:13.503 --> 01:05:18.287]  And all he wants is to bring you down because he hates himself so much.
[01:05:25.499 --> 01:05:30.762]  And I just want you to understand, I mean, look at that satisfied look of that predator.
[01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:39.887]  Who's gonna tell you no one's ever been hurt by a vaccine and Alex Jones is a white supremacist.
[01:05:40.507 --> 01:05:41.848]  No, you're a supremacist.
[01:05:42.148 --> 01:05:48.551]  You're a globalist supremacist who believes you own everyone and that it's your right to hate everybody because you are a psychopath.
[01:05:49.952 --> 01:05:51.773]  With all your sociopathic tendencies,
[01:05:54.104 --> 01:05:58.967]  Who only gets value out of lying and stealing and defrauding humanity.
[01:06:00.948 --> 01:06:04.290]  And so know that Jeff Zucker, you're not God.
[01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:05.811]  You'll never be God.
[01:06:05.851 --> 01:06:10.234]  So keep pretending you are, and you will face God Almighty in judgment.
[01:06:11.114 --> 01:06:15.397]  And you will be dumped with all the rest of the devil worshipers like yourself into the pit of hell.
[01:06:15.717 --> 01:06:16.578]  You are cursed.
[01:06:19.759 --> 01:06:20.280]  Welcome back.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.340]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:23.081]  Open the phones up next hour.
[01:06:24.793 --> 01:06:28.895]  Roger Stone is able to join us right now and I really appreciate him coming on.
[01:06:29.035 --> 01:06:32.516]  It was in the London Guardian, the New York Times, Washington Post, it was in everything.
[01:06:32.596 --> 01:06:42.560]  CNN, back on September 15th, he came on the show and he said they're going to steal Georgia, they're going to steal Nevada, they're going to steal Pennsylvania.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:50.243]  Trump must have the Justice Department seize the servers when it's evident with the election fraud.
[01:06:51.694 --> 01:06:53.055]  Because they weren't certifying them.
[01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:58.539]  They were using decertified machines in the states they were in and that were decertified in other states.
[01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:01.081]  The evidence is monumental.
[01:07:02.116 --> 01:07:06.398]  Now you've got UPS drivers that were shipping in 300,000 ballots from another state.
[01:07:06.859 --> 01:07:10.921]  You've got the Chinese mailing in all these ballots for Biden, caught, confirmed.
[01:07:11.321 --> 01:07:18.104]  We've got computer scientists that saw people going and putting thumb drives in illegally, taking it out, coming back and putting it in the central computer.
[01:07:18.305 --> 01:07:20.626]  That's illegal in Georgia and in Pennsylvania.
[01:07:20.866 --> 01:07:22.547]  They have the witnesses and the damn video!
[01:07:24.568 --> 01:07:29.211]  And the Attorney General says, no evidence that rises to the level of changing the election.
[01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:29.731]  What do you mean?
[01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:32.433]  13,000 votes in Georgia.
[01:07:34.014 --> 01:07:37.716]  And Trump's within striking distance very easily in Pennsylvania.
[01:07:37.756 --> 01:07:41.338]  So Rogers here with us, he got lied about and exaggerated.
[01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:42.639]  He didn't call for martial law.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.361]  It's Lin Wood calling for limited martial law.
[01:07:45.401 --> 01:07:46.942]  We're already under globalist martial law.
[01:07:47.162 --> 01:07:48.843]  The blue cities and states already put us under lockdown.
[01:07:49.143 --> 01:07:52.125]  But this is a foreign takeover.
[01:07:52.165 --> 01:07:52.986]  This is fraud.
[01:07:53.786 --> 01:07:59.848]  And so, I don't think Trump should even punt to the electors and the legislators.
[01:07:59.968 --> 01:08:09.211]  I think he should go with the American people, resolute desk, show all this evidence, and say, stand with me, American people, say no to this.
[01:08:09.291 --> 01:08:10.152]  I know I'm going to D.C.
[01:08:10.192 --> 01:08:10.412]  on the 12th.
[01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:12.791]  I know I'm going to that event.
[01:08:13.471 --> 01:08:15.312]  And by the way, I'm taking that big march over.
[01:08:15.352 --> 01:08:16.272]  We started it before.
[01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:17.753]  These women hijacked it.
[01:08:18.213 --> 01:08:19.114]  Now they're saying it again.
[01:08:19.154 --> 01:08:21.915]  You can't even hear them on their microphone when 500,000 are there.
[01:08:22.155 --> 01:08:22.656]  I'll be there.
[01:08:22.716 --> 01:08:23.696]  We'll march to the White House.
[01:08:23.736 --> 01:08:24.377]  It's going to be great.
[01:08:24.417 --> 01:08:24.957]  I'll see you there.
[01:08:25.257 --> 01:08:26.058]  Nothing against those women.
[01:08:26.298 --> 01:08:29.679]  They cussed us out when I got up on the stage at the Supreme Court before they got there.
[01:08:29.699 --> 01:08:30.580]  I led the whole march there.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.961]  Three hours later, they show up.
[01:08:32.221 --> 01:08:32.941]  I'm up on the stage.
[01:08:33.221 --> 01:08:34.362]  She goes, F you.
[01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:35.182]  This is my event.
[01:08:35.262 --> 01:08:35.823]  Super funny.
[01:08:36.063 --> 01:08:38.124]  I'm not even worried about those little carpet-bagging ladies.
[01:08:39.064 --> 01:08:42.147]  You know, the whole point is, is that we're going, we're taking it over, it's going to be awesome.
[01:08:42.328 --> 01:08:42.888]  It's our event.
[01:08:43.288 --> 01:08:46.972]  They took over our last event, now they heard we were going to the 12th, they said they're doing it again.
[01:08:47.172 --> 01:08:47.552]  It's fine.
[01:08:47.793 --> 01:08:48.874]  Thank you for organizing it, ladies.
[01:08:48.914 --> 01:08:50.535]  I'll be there, taking over my event.
[01:08:51.116 --> 01:08:52.537]  But Roger Stone joins us.
[01:08:53.037 --> 01:08:54.218]  Thank you so much, Roger.
[01:08:54.879 --> 01:08:55.500]  Where are we?
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:03.047]  You predicted that they were going to steal it from Trump, you laid it out, and now Linwood and others are saying that you were absolutely right.
[01:09:03.387 --> 01:09:04.168]  What's the next move?
[01:09:05.182 --> 01:09:09.323]  Well, first of all, Alex, I think we're in a very, very crucial period here.
[01:09:09.343 --> 01:09:16.086]  I do think we as conservatives need to be careful not to form the firing squad in a circle.
[01:09:16.866 --> 01:09:25.269]  There's plenty of time down the road after we save this country for recriminations of those who were true patriots and those who only said they were.
[01:09:25.869 --> 01:09:30.491]  You and I know, having been under extreme pressure from the federal government, that
[01:09:31.132 --> 01:09:38.718]  The people who stick with you are your true friends, and the people who are nice to you when you could do something for them, they were never your friends.
[01:09:39.239 --> 01:09:51.709]  But right now, I think we have to put all differences aside, because what we have here is, you're absolutely right, nothing short of a foreign governmental takeover of the United States.
[01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:59.476]  Let's go to that show, where I said specifically, if there was overwhelming and compelling evidence of fraud,
[01:10:00.388 --> 01:10:12.791]  And it was connected to the voting system itself, which it has been, then the president would have to consider the 1807 insurrection law or martial law.
[01:10:13.451 --> 01:10:19.213]  Headline, Stone says if Trump loses, he should impose martial law.
[01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:20.773]  Not what I said.
[01:10:20.793 --> 01:10:27.615]  However, all the conditions that I did list in that article, Lin Wood seems to believe
[01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:29.758]  That we have exceeded.
[01:10:29.778 --> 01:10:35.541]  And I think the president has to have all options on the table as to how he proceeds.
[01:10:35.621 --> 01:10:38.323]  The one thing he cannot do, Alex, is quit.
[01:10:39.464 --> 01:10:43.066]  He has powerful forces arrayed against him.
[01:10:44.527 --> 01:10:46.488]  It is extraordinary.
[01:10:46.528 --> 01:10:49.029]  Let's call them the armies of the pharaoh.
[01:10:49.349 --> 01:10:50.330]  The pharaoh's armies.
[01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:53.562]  This is God's nation.
[01:10:53.762 --> 01:10:56.764]  I believe he was selected for God for this job.
[01:10:57.424 --> 01:11:14.976]  I pray to God every day that he will not, not only not quit, but he will be strengthened in his resolve to fight an epically corrupt deep state that has no problem in what appears to be the cyber manipulation of the votes of the American people.
[01:11:15.636 --> 01:11:19.919]  And here's the problem, Alex, with these deep state types.
[01:11:21.205 --> 01:11:22.626]  They're too smart by half.
[01:11:23.806 --> 01:11:45.596]  So when more people vote in a precinct than are registered to vote in that precinct, when the computerized machinery that counts votes is reported to have counted more votes than the machine can possibly do, given that time period, considering the time and the way it operates, they've overplayed their hand.
[01:11:46.388 --> 01:11:55.095]  When USPS drivers talk about crossing multiple state ballots with, I think it was hundreds of thousands.
[01:11:55.115 --> 01:11:55.095]  300,000.
[01:11:56.856 --> 01:11:58.578]  300,000 pre-voted ballots.
[01:11:59.458 --> 01:12:13.910]  I just learned of absolute incontrovertible evidence of North Korean boats delivering ballots through a harbor in Maine, the state of Maine.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:25.646]  If this checks out, if law enforcement looked into that and it turned out to be true, it would be proof of foreign involvement in the election.
[01:12:26.086 --> 01:12:27.687]  We already have enough.
[01:12:27.907 --> 01:12:38.973]  If it is borne out that our voter data bounced from Germany and halfway around Europe before ending up in the United States, I think that would pass that legal test.
[01:12:39.754 --> 01:12:43.196]  The President does have specific authority
[01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:48.935]  Where there are instances of foreign attempts to affect our country.
[01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:50.676]  I believe it's 2018.
[01:12:53.038 --> 01:12:54.879]  I'm not sure of the executive order.
[01:12:54.899 --> 01:12:55.600]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.561]  What about this news?
[01:12:57.121 --> 01:12:59.082]  I hired a great security firm.
[01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:02.265]  I got contacted by the White House three weeks ago.
[01:13:02.285 --> 01:13:07.068]  They said, please look into Dominion and Soros and China and look into this.
[01:13:07.129 --> 01:13:09.090]  Obviously, they had classified info.
[01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.891]  They wanted me to look into it.
[01:13:10.431 --> 01:13:10.991]  And I did.
[01:13:11.872 --> 01:13:32.383]  We conclusively proved with the SEC filings that firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems, Smartmatic is another group, but this is Staple Street, firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million from a Swiss bank account fund, 75% owned by the Communist Chinese government itself.
[01:13:33.184 --> 01:13:35.105]  And we got all the SEC filings, brother.
[01:13:35.405 --> 01:13:39.207]  I mean, this is sensational information.
[01:13:39.247 --> 01:13:40.348]  Can you believe this?
[01:13:41.397 --> 01:13:49.501]  Well, Alex, I think that it's important to understand that Dominion is just, you know, one cog in a greater machine.
[01:13:49.561 --> 01:14:00.806]  In other words, the software that Dominion is using to manipulate votes, a program called VoterGuard, was developed and sold to them by Bill Gates and Microsoft.
[01:14:01.666 --> 01:14:06.068]  Every major voting computation computerized system
[01:14:06.698 --> 01:14:14.501]  Doing business in the United States, in fact most of the world, has bought this program and utilizes it.
[01:14:14.761 --> 01:14:25.464]  92% of the voters in the United States, votes are tabulated by companies like Dominion, including Dominion, that use this, that's it, election guard, pardon me.
[01:14:26.605 --> 01:14:32.147]  This is where the insidious intrusion appears to take place.
[01:14:32.727 --> 01:14:35.608]  So we have had the Dominion
[01:14:36.503 --> 01:14:44.506]  The focus has been good because Dominion has more of the swing states as clients than some of the other states.
[01:14:44.586 --> 01:14:53.529]  But essentially, this whole pattern of vote manipulation has been going on not just in the swing states, but in every state.
[01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:57.511]  We now see evidence of it in Virginia, for example.
[01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:00.211]  So we have a scandal here.
[01:15:00.711 --> 01:15:16.614]  Those who say the president should just concede, those like Bill Barr, who we can talk about when we get back, who just don't want to see that the evidence is not only incredible, tremendous in size, but most compelling.
[01:15:17.915 --> 01:15:19.495]  There are smoking guns here.
[01:15:20.407 --> 01:15:30.212]  And that some in the media won't see it and some kowtow to the media by insisting it doesn't exist could steal this election.
[01:15:30.472 --> 01:15:31.673]  Well, let's talk about Barr.
[01:15:31.753 --> 01:15:32.613]  Let's talk about China.
[01:15:32.633 --> 01:15:35.134]  Let's talk about what Trump should do next with 49 days.
[01:15:36.215 --> 01:15:38.276]  Gosh, we'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[01:15:39.276 --> 01:15:39.737]  Welcome back.
[01:15:39.777 --> 01:15:40.797]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:15:40.817 --> 01:15:45.199]  Roger Stone, former chief advisor on politics for President Trump.
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.041]  And of course, he tried to make him a political prisoner.
[01:15:49.875 --> 01:15:50.735]  He's here with us.
[01:15:51.796 --> 01:15:54.117]  Be sure and visit his site, StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:15:56.699 --> 01:16:12.648]  Roger, continuing here, for me, it's very surreal, otherworldly, unreal, that, I mean, China openly is financing out of Swiss bank accounts dominion.
[01:16:13.548 --> 01:16:14.689]  You've got all this fraud.
[01:16:16.049 --> 01:16:19.852]  You've got the media declaring Biden the winner without the evidence.
[01:16:20.873 --> 01:16:25.137]  Now the president, when they have these press conferences, no one's even covering it.
[01:16:25.737 --> 01:16:27.299]  The censorship is coming home to roost.
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:34.745]  I really think he should be at the Resolute Desk laying out China, destroying the Democratic Party, going to full war.
[01:16:35.385 --> 01:16:42.712]  What do you or what do your sources say he's doing behind the scenes and why is he staying so relatively quiet?
[01:16:44.026 --> 01:16:48.890]  I can't address the question as to whether he is, why he seems to be lying low.
[01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:56.276]  However, he does understand that this can often be an extraordinarily effective tactic where you
[01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:00.012]  As Charles de Gaulle did, you withdraw for the moment.
[01:17:00.092 --> 01:17:09.680]  Then, when he has something important to say, he's got the bully pulpit, he can do it in a photo op, he can do it in an interview, he can do it, you know, in a phone call.
[01:17:10.141 --> 01:17:11.922]  And it would still be covered.
[01:17:12.783 --> 01:17:15.325]  Now, they are going to try to minimize his presence.
[01:17:16.066 --> 01:17:20.749]  I remember when he told me in the beginning that Twitter would never, ever censor him.
[01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.491]  He's the President of the United States.
[01:17:22.611 --> 01:17:24.973]  And I said, I'm sorry, sir, I think you're wrong.
[01:17:25.593 --> 01:17:26.074]  Here we are.
[01:17:27.306 --> 01:17:44.418]  It is outrageous, but now I think the fact that Bill Barr has finally shown himself, you understand why the Trump Justice Department did nothing about internet censorship, which violates antitrust law and is monopolistic in its practices?
[01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:55.585]  It's why they prosecuted Roger Stone on trumped-up charges in a kangaroo court for a Soviet-style show trial, and they themselves on
[01:17:56.895 --> 01:18:16.458]  Election Day released the balance of the previously redacted Mueller report excerpts that prove that they never had any evidence whatsoever regarding my doing anything, commuting, colluding, coordinating, consulting, or receiving anything from Julian Assange or WikiLeaks.
[01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:20.451]  They knew this, but they withheld that from us at trial.
[01:18:20.811 --> 01:18:23.252]  So how do we get the president to take action?
[01:18:23.792 --> 01:18:27.394]  And with 49 days out, what would you be doing right now if you were the president?
[01:18:28.894 --> 01:18:32.736]  Well, you know, I don't have all the facts in one place.
[01:18:32.936 --> 01:18:35.917]  I have a very high regard for Sidney Powell.
[01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:46.561]  I have an equally high regard for my old friend, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who I've had a friendship with since his first campaign for mayor of New York City.
[01:18:47.282 --> 01:19:00.689]  A man who was undeniably one of the greatest mayors in New York history who took a crumbling slum in decline and turned it into one of the safest, most vibrant cities in the United States.
[01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:07.093]  But they would have to tell the President what the status is in each of these states.
[01:19:07.873 --> 01:19:14.237]  We should not forget, however, that the courts are not the last stop in this journey.
[01:19:15.066 --> 01:19:22.730]  That the state legislatures have a role in the certification of electors to the Electoral College.
[01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:35.337]  And the state legislatures have the same requirement before they make a learned decision as to what slate to send, whether the election in the state was legally conducted.
[01:19:36.097 --> 01:19:41.700]  They're entitled to all the evidence that was submitted to the courts for their own examination.
[01:19:42.466 --> 01:19:50.208]  And I think supporters of the president in the key states need to begin now contacting your Republican state legislators.
[01:19:50.308 --> 01:19:54.089]  Those are your Republican state senators or your state representatives.
[01:19:54.849 --> 01:20:10.113]  Some states, they call them assembly and urge them to support the president to support an objective and honest count of the election and the certification of electors that will support Donald Trump at the Electoral College.
[01:20:11.906 --> 01:20:14.488]  The stonewalling, there's no evidence, is ridiculous.
[01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:18.031]  You know, Alex, it's even worse than that.
[01:20:18.611 --> 01:20:26.814]  If they were smart, they would say, of course there was the routine level that you'd expect of some voter fraud.
[01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:32.777]  It was essentially de minimis, and it certainly didn't affect the outcome of the election.
[01:20:33.057 --> 01:20:35.858]  Sure, we could examine it, but there's nothing really there.
[01:20:36.258 --> 01:20:39.360]  Instead, they say, there is no evidence.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:40.620]  Nothing.
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.021]  Anyone who says that is a conspiracy theorist.
[01:20:43.341 --> 01:20:44.942]  You're insane if you believe this.
[01:20:46.187 --> 01:20:49.750]  See, that's where they, I think they insult the intelligence of the American people.
[01:20:50.030 --> 01:21:10.628]  It's like going online and you get some information which is accurate but depicts the President in his ongoing fight in a favorable light and a little box pops up and says, the associate, well first it said, authoritative sources have declared Joe Biden the winner, or official sources.
[01:21:11.297 --> 01:21:14.580]  Then when you look that up, it was CNN and the Associated Press.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:15.521]  Wrong.
[01:21:16.021 --> 01:21:20.385]  Then they changed it to the Associated Press has declared Joe Biden the winner.
[01:21:21.025 --> 01:21:21.326]  Really?
[01:21:21.446 --> 01:21:22.006]  Who cares?
[01:21:22.627 --> 01:21:24.068]  How about the Electoral College?
[01:21:24.789 --> 01:21:30.133]  It's so obvious and annoying, and it just keeps getting more and more.
[01:21:30.433 --> 01:21:36.799]  You hate going online because you don't want to be chided by the nanny state telling you what to think.
[01:21:39.209 --> 01:21:46.152]  This sure vindicates what you warned of three months ago, and I don't want to be a Monday morning quarterback here, but now Trump better listen to you.
[01:21:46.212 --> 01:21:47.192]  What else should he be doing?
[01:21:49.633 --> 01:21:51.654]  Pardon me, a Marco Rubio moment.
[01:21:52.434 --> 01:21:53.794]  Some delicious water, that's right.
[01:21:54.755 --> 01:21:55.435]  Little Marco.
[01:21:57.516 --> 01:21:58.596]  In any event, thank you, Alex.
[01:22:00.137 --> 01:22:03.378]  The president, I think, needs to not give up the fight.
[01:22:04.073 --> 01:22:06.895]  I don't think it is advantageous at this point.
[01:22:06.995 --> 01:22:31.569]  He should let his lawyers fight it out in Sidney Powell and Mayor Giuliani and now the emergence of completely independent and working for his own clients, Lin Wood, who I've had a couple conversations with and who I think is, I've spoken to and have communicated with and who I'm very impressed with, a fine Christian, a very, very capable and creative lawyer has joined this fight.
[01:22:33.085 --> 01:22:35.286]  And he takes the same view that I do.
[01:22:35.366 --> 01:22:40.047]  The first and most important thing that every American can do is pray.
[01:22:40.908 --> 01:22:43.088]  Pray for the salvation of this nation.
[01:22:43.809 --> 01:22:51.811]  Pray that Jesus Christ delivers us and the nation from those who seek to destroy America.
[01:22:52.512 --> 01:22:54.954]  That's why the left wants the churches closed.
[01:22:54.994 --> 01:23:02.981]  They literally, metaphysically know that prayer is going on and groups of people are together praying and that we have incredible spiritual psychic power.
[01:23:03.881 --> 01:23:08.445]  This is not just some political squabble between Republicans and Democrats for control.
[01:23:08.965 --> 01:23:13.689]  This is not a squabble between two wings of the establishment for control.
[01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:18.313]  This is an epic struggle between good and evil, between light and dark,
[01:23:18.914 --> 01:23:28.257]  Between an America that has a future of freedom and liberty and hardcore totalitarianism, collectivism and a slave state.
[01:23:28.897 --> 01:23:30.237]  Those are the stakes, Alex.
[01:23:30.277 --> 01:23:31.358]  Thanks for having me back.
[01:23:32.178 --> 01:23:36.139]  I look forward to joining you again next week with some kind of an update.
[01:23:36.639 --> 01:23:38.420]  It's all so fast moving.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:44.942]  I'm trying to finish my book, which is tentatively entitled Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong.
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:52.407]  My political persecution in the heist of the 2020 election, but that's a working title.
[01:23:52.907 --> 01:23:54.148]  So thanks for having with me.
[01:23:54.208 --> 01:23:58.272]  God bless you and keep hope alive here.
[01:23:58.312 --> 01:24:04.919]  I think the Trump supporters out there need to understand the fight is not over until we say it's over.
[01:24:05.479 --> 01:24:06.179]  Well, that's right.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.180]  It's all a psy-op.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:07.960]  We've got to say no.
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:12.843]  And regardless, we've got to discredit Joe Biden up front, a total chi-com agent.
[01:24:13.263 --> 01:24:17.165]  Everything they said Trump was doing, he was getting Russian money, Chinese money.
[01:24:17.605 --> 01:24:22.828]  I mean, wow, we've got to make sure the Republican establishment goes to war with this guy, regardless of what happens.
[01:24:23.128 --> 01:24:23.828]  Thank you so much.
[01:24:23.868 --> 01:24:25.049]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:24:25.929 --> 01:24:26.750]  Many thanks, Alex.
[01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:30.452]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, there goes Roger Stone.
[01:24:31.212 --> 01:24:34.614]  Really appreciate him joining us on the transmission today.
[01:24:35.871 --> 01:24:37.993]  We got times messed up again for whatever reason.
[01:24:38.313 --> 01:24:45.279]  These things happen in threes, so very rarely do we have trouble with the guess and the timing, but this was the third time that this happened.
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.280]  But we got him on today.
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:49.322]  It wasn't on Monday, then Tuesday.
[01:24:49.362 --> 01:24:50.123]  We got him today.
[01:24:50.143 --> 01:24:50.763]  There it was.
[01:24:50.883 --> 01:24:52.845]  Now we're going to open the phones up next hour.
[01:24:53.486 --> 01:24:56.388]  I've got a bunch of videos, a bunch of crazy stuff we've got to break down.
[01:24:56.788 --> 01:24:58.249]  Crazed liberal man harasses woman.
[01:24:58.290 --> 01:24:59.531]  Put your effing mask on.
[01:25:00.626 --> 01:25:03.788]  We've got a big scientific report just came out with scientists.
[01:25:04.208 --> 01:25:05.668]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:25:06.069 --> 01:25:15.613]  Global team of prestigious scientists finds 10 fatal flaws, that's a quote, in the main COVID test and say it's a fraud.
[01:25:16.233 --> 01:25:19.955]  But out of that fraud is, it's not deaths now, it's, oh, you're infected.
[01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:22.797]  Of course, the whole thing is a criminal takeover.
[01:25:22.857 --> 01:25:23.297]  Separately,
[01:25:24.158 --> 01:25:25.279]  We have a promo code right now.
[01:25:25.319 --> 01:25:26.080]  We rarely do this.

[01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:55.292]  And now with the power of it being sold out for a year, with the COVID lockdown, we couldn't get some of the patented stuff.

[01:26:05.497 --> 01:26:05.877]  Stay with us.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:17.493]  If you want to fight the globalists, if you want to resist the new order takeover and the Great Reset, then be part of what my good friend Jason Burmess coined the other day, the Great Resistance.
[01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:18.734]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:26:22.028 --> 01:26:26.989]  And the answer to the Great Reset is the Great Renaissance, or the Great Resistance.
[01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:35.532]  And that starts at InfoWars.com and Banned.Video, where our views and support is exploding when it comes to actual visitors.
[01:26:35.912 --> 01:26:39.073]  But when it comes to financing our operation, money's actually gone down.
[01:26:39.693 --> 01:26:40.974]  I guess people think, well, Jones is right.
[01:26:40.994 --> 01:26:41.854]  He must have lots of support.
[01:26:41.874 --> 01:26:42.555]  No, that's not the case.
[01:26:42.955 --> 01:26:44.036]  We need financial support.
[01:26:44.376 --> 01:26:45.597]  Plus, we have great products you need.

[01:27:02.367 --> 01:27:03.588]  Spread the word about Man.Video.
[01:27:03.788 --> 01:27:06.470]  Because the great resistance to tyranny is here.
[01:27:06.997 --> 01:27:09.779]  I've got like 50 incredible clips or more.
[01:27:10.299 --> 01:27:14.742]  I've just got, you know, used to I'd show the enemy being evil and bad and go, oh, look, they're bad.
[01:27:14.782 --> 01:27:16.524]  I mean, what is even the point now?
[01:27:16.944 --> 01:27:17.925]  I don't want to look at Biden.
[01:27:17.965 --> 01:27:19.486]  I don't want to look at Kamala Harris.
[01:27:19.626 --> 01:27:22.548]  I know you don't want to look at him either, but we got to look at him.
[01:27:23.889 --> 01:27:24.849]  You see, evil's smart.
[01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:33.375]  It knows how to be so disgusting and so out of control that you're just finally like, I can't handle it.
[01:27:33.455 --> 01:27:34.236]  I'm going to run and hide.
[01:27:35.396 --> 01:27:39.959]  And not because you're scared of them, but because you're just so sick of them!
[01:27:48.344 --> 01:27:52.246]  There's a lot of good news happening too, but... Man, have you seen the hundreds?
[01:27:52.266 --> 01:27:53.386]  How do I say hundreds?
[01:27:53.467 --> 01:28:04.353]  I mean, there's like three or four videos a day of Democrat mayors, Democrat senators, House members, legislative leaders, mayors, you know, city council members, just everywhere.
[01:28:06.972 --> 01:28:13.476]  At parties with 50 people not wearing masks sitting right next to each other and going to get their hair cut and all of it.
[01:28:13.736 --> 01:28:15.698]  They always go, well, I'm important, you're not.
[01:28:15.718 --> 01:28:21.542]  And a lot of conservatives go, oh look, you got caught, you're a hypocrite, and they always apologize.
[01:28:21.582 --> 01:28:22.302]  Don't even go with that.
[01:28:22.342 --> 01:28:23.423]  Go, hey, we know it's a hoax.
[01:28:23.963 --> 01:28:24.744]  We know it's a fraud.
[01:28:24.764 --> 01:28:26.225]  We know you're teaching us to be afraid of the cold.
[01:28:29.387 --> 01:28:32.729]  And so don't be a tattletale, point out they're hypocrites.
[01:28:34.104 --> 01:28:38.766]  But just understand, when you look at these people, these are the bottom of the barrel.
[01:28:38.866 --> 01:28:45.548]  Newsom, and the San Francisco mayor, with like 50 people at a fancy restaurant.
[01:28:48.509 --> 01:28:53.931]  And again, they've outdoored all dining.
[01:28:55.052 --> 01:29:01.694]  By outlawing indoor dining, but then you catch them at a Democrat-owned restaurant, and they're open, because that's a little secret.
[01:29:03.294 --> 01:29:08.556]  Newsom signed a waiver where his wineries and restaurants, that's where his money comes from.
[01:29:09.757 --> 01:29:14.039]  Democrats launder money through his wineries, his well-known Pelosi mafia family.
[01:29:15.319 --> 01:29:22.262]  And they keep their 20-something wineries and restaurants open.
[01:29:22.843 --> 01:29:24.043]  But that was a problem for him.
[01:29:24.083 --> 01:29:30.446]  So now, they just keep them open outside the law, but they run the cops so nobody stops them.
[01:29:33.161 --> 01:29:33.608]  And folks...
[01:29:34.656 --> 01:29:41.617]  That's when you're in North Korea, when their restaurants and their little churches and everything they got stay open, but you can't.
[01:29:42.078 --> 01:29:44.318]  And you sit there and you go, I'm not essential.
[01:29:44.718 --> 01:29:47.679]  I'm going to close my little florist shop in a small town.
[01:29:48.079 --> 01:29:50.199]  I'm going to close my women's shop in a small town.
[01:29:50.599 --> 01:29:54.540]  I drive over small towns in Texas and the damn Walmarts are open.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:55.920]  The Targets are open.
[01:29:56.241 --> 01:29:57.321]  The Sam's Clubs are open.
[01:29:57.361 --> 01:30:00.301]  The Amazon trucks are driving up and down the road in the middle of nowhere.
[01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:02.982]  But you drive by those little towns and they're closed.
[01:30:03.973 --> 01:30:06.095]  Everybody's just shaking and peeing on themselves.
[01:30:10.939 --> 01:30:15.723]  The Democrats are just laughing their criminal asses all the way to the bank.
[01:30:18.105 --> 01:30:19.506]  But there's an evil force behind them.
[01:30:21.367 --> 01:30:22.148]  It's not laughing.
[01:30:23.269 --> 01:30:23.910]  It's scheming.
[01:30:26.732 --> 01:30:28.954]  I want to give the number out as we start the third hour.
[01:30:28.974 --> 01:30:30.115]  I want to take your calls about
[01:30:31.755 --> 01:30:34.216]  Why is President Trump not at the Resolute Desk?
[01:30:34.396 --> 01:30:35.796]  Why is he not having the rallies?
[01:30:35.896 --> 01:30:39.797]  Why is he not galvanizing the people to say this election's illegitimate?
[01:30:39.837 --> 01:30:49.359]  Well, the conventional thinking is, well, he needs the lawyers to get the proof of the election fraud, and then have a victory and turn a state, and then he'll come out.
[01:30:49.439 --> 01:30:55.700]  Well, because he's not putting political pressure on things the Democrats are, that's not happening.
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:00.761]  And they can black out Giuliani
[01:31:03.746 --> 01:31:06.407]  And Lin Wood and the rest of them.
[01:31:09.569 --> 01:31:18.993]  And so because of that, Barr, who you know is under tremendous pressure, came out and said they found no evidence because Trump has been criticizing the Justice Department and the FBI.
[01:31:19.253 --> 01:31:21.074]  There's unbelievable evidence.
[01:31:21.574 --> 01:31:27.857]  We'll play a clip of a UPS driver who found hundreds of thousands of ballots in his vehicle that were unmarked from another state.
[01:31:27.897 --> 01:31:28.537]  That's illegal!
[01:31:30.298 --> 01:31:32.799]  That's why they had hundreds of thousands more ballots in Georgia.
[01:31:33.643 --> 01:31:37.585]  That were mailed back in than were ever sent out.
[01:31:39.006 --> 01:31:46.010]  They had many precincts in Michigan and Georgia and Pennsylvania where they had over 100% of Democrats vote.
[01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:46.451]  Over 100%!
[01:31:46.991 --> 01:31:54.596]  They've now found in Arizona that 40,000 people voted twice for Joe Biden.
[01:31:58.458 --> 01:31:59.859]  Remember Barack Obama famously?
[01:32:02.108 --> 01:32:07.071]  In 2016 said, oh, people that come to this country that are immigrants, they should vote.
[01:32:09.572 --> 01:32:12.114]  That's their constitutional right as an immigrant to vote.
[01:32:12.954 --> 01:32:15.296]  Trying to manipulate people to go vote.
[01:32:15.316 --> 01:32:23.121]  But the truth is, they have almost no success getting foreigners, whether they're from Russia or whether they're from Mexico.
[01:32:23.161 --> 01:32:25.162]  The studies are out there.
[01:32:25.202 --> 01:32:28.304]  There's not Mexicans that are illegals going and voting.
[01:32:30.618 --> 01:32:38.925]  What there is, is rolls of dead people and Democrats that go out and vote via the mail and in person because they know there's no prosecution.
[01:32:40.587 --> 01:32:44.710]  So it's election fraud that's orchestrated from on top, but it's voter fraud down at the bottom.
[01:32:45.851 --> 01:32:52.717]  So the Democrats go, oh, the Republicans are saying the Mexicans and the black people are illegally voting or voting twice.
[01:32:52.837 --> 01:32:54.058]  Nobody said that but you.
[01:32:55.339 --> 01:32:58.582]  But they go into those underfunded minority districts
[01:33:01.092 --> 01:33:10.434]  And they steal it and they stuff it there because then when it comes out that it's a minority district, they can hide behind the black people like they always do.
[01:33:12.834 --> 01:33:13.675]  It's disgusting.
[01:33:15.375 --> 01:33:16.475]  And it never ends, does it?
[01:33:18.356 --> 01:33:20.116]  But here's the big make it or break it.
[01:33:20.156 --> 01:33:30.118]  I got really excited two weeks ago when they reshoveled the Supreme Court judges that are over the different circuit courts, over the 10 circuit courts.
[01:33:32.608 --> 01:33:40.774]  And I said, that's a good sign that they put some conservatives over states that didn't have conservatives over them before.
[01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:44.816]  That was a big ray of sunshine.
[01:33:45.157 --> 01:33:46.558]  But now we're about to find out.
[01:33:48.019 --> 01:33:49.399]  The rubber is now meeting the road.
[01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:58.586]  Senator Ted Cruz urges Supreme Court of the United States to hear Trump campaign emergency appeal in Pennsylvania.
[01:34:00.867 --> 01:34:01.828]  And here's what.
[01:34:03.325 --> 01:34:05.067]  He put it into the senatorial record.
[01:34:05.567 --> 01:34:07.929]  Senator Cruz urges U.S.
[01:34:07.949 --> 01:34:12.653]  Supreme Court to hear emergency appeal on Pennsylvania election challenge.
[01:34:14.395 --> 01:34:18.618]  Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, issued the following statement in support of the U.S.
[01:34:18.639 --> 01:34:24.103]  Supreme Court hearing an emergency appeal challenging the election results in Pennsylvania.
[01:34:24.564 --> 01:34:26.245]  Today an emergency appeal was filed in the U.S.
[01:34:26.265 --> 01:34:29.268]  Supreme Court challenging the election results in Pennsylvania.
[01:34:30.578 --> 01:34:38.724]  The appeal raises serious legal issues and I believe the court should hear the case on an expedited basis.
[01:34:38.744 --> 01:34:46.950]  The Pennsylvania Constitution requires in-person voting except in narrowly defined circumstances last year, late last year, before the COVID crisis.
[01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:48.151]  Isn't that strange?
[01:34:49.147 --> 01:34:58.695]  The Pennsylvania legislature passed a law that purported to allow universal mail-in voting, notwithstanding the Pennsylvania Constitution's express prohibition.
[01:34:59.496 --> 01:35:00.436]  See how that works?
[01:35:00.637 --> 01:35:08.483]  Before the COVID, getting it all lined up, this appeal argues that Pennsylvania cannot change the rules in the middle of the game.
[01:35:08.503 --> 01:35:14.909]  If Pennsylvania wants to change how voting occurs, the state must follow the law to do so.
[01:35:15.762 --> 01:35:26.131]  The illegality was compounded by a partisan Democrat Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, which has issued multiple decisions that reflect their political and ideological bias.
[01:35:27.113 --> 01:35:47.514]  Just over a month ago, Justice Alito, along with Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch, wrote correctly, I believe, concerning the Pennsylvania court's previous decision to count ballots received after election day, that there is a strong likelihood that the state Supreme Court decision violates the federal constitution.
[01:35:48.195 --> 01:35:48.576]  Think so?
[01:35:50.484 --> 01:36:11.952]  In the current appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismisses the claim based on a legal doctrine called laches, which essentially means the plaintiffs waited too long to bring the challenge, but the plaintiffs reasonably argue the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not applied that doctrine consistently and so they cannot selectively enforce it now.
[01:36:12.573 --> 01:36:13.953]  And that is absolutely true.
[01:36:14.573 --> 01:36:15.054]  Continuing.
[01:36:17.234 --> 01:36:18.435]  Even more persuasively,
[01:36:20.424 --> 01:36:35.849]  The plaintiffs point out that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has also held that plaintiffs don't have standing in challenge in election law until after the election, meaning that the court effectively put them in a catch-22.
[01:36:36.549 --> 01:36:38.610]  Before the election, they lacked standing.
[01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:40.651]  After the election, they delayed too long.
[01:36:41.191 --> 01:36:44.612]  The result of the court's gamesmanship is that a
[01:36:48.348 --> 01:36:54.752]  Unconstitutional election, on its face, and a law that could never be judicially challenged.
[01:36:55.992 --> 01:36:56.433]  Factually.
[01:36:57.593 --> 01:36:58.894]  Ordinarily, the U.S.
[01:36:58.914 --> 01:37:04.377]  Supreme Court would stay out of an election dispute, especially concerning state law.
[01:37:05.218 --> 01:37:06.559]  But these are not ordinary times.
[01:37:07.737 --> 01:37:13.342]  As of today, according to Reuters polling, 39% of Americans believe the election was rigged.
[01:37:14.142 --> 01:37:17.625]  And of course, 70, 90, depending on the poll of Republicans.
[01:37:18.386 --> 01:37:20.248]  That is not healthy for our democracy.
[01:37:21.108 --> 01:37:26.193]  The bitter division and acrimony we see across the nation needs resolution.
[01:37:26.693 --> 01:37:27.634]  And I believe the U.S.
[01:37:27.654 --> 01:37:30.817]  Supreme Court has a responsibility to the American people to ensure
[01:37:31.906 --> 01:37:33.787]  We are following the law and following the Constitution.
[01:37:34.607 --> 01:37:43.631]  Hearing this case now on an emergency expedited basis would be an important step in helping rebuild confidence in the integrity of our democratic system.
[01:37:45.011 --> 01:37:51.414]  The reason I read all that is he's a well-known constitutional lawyer, top of his class, former Attorney General of Texas.
[01:37:51.434 --> 01:37:55.976]  Say what you want about Cruz, he's probably the smartest person in government.
[01:37:56.456 --> 01:37:57.956]  But you don't need to be smart to know this.
[01:37:58.197 --> 01:37:59.037]  This is on its face.
[01:38:01.144 --> 01:38:04.625]  You can't have them make up law that's not even in the law.
[01:38:06.625 --> 01:38:09.146]  And you can't have them override the federal law.
[01:38:10.306 --> 01:38:12.767]  And you also can't have them throwing out all the poll watchers.
[01:38:12.827 --> 01:38:15.047]  It's the same formula in all these states they stole.
[01:38:15.767 --> 01:38:18.088]  And you can't have them post-dating things.
[01:38:18.588 --> 01:38:19.428]  We have all the witnesses.
[01:38:19.468 --> 01:38:20.629]  We have all the damn witnesses.
[01:38:20.649 --> 01:38:21.249]  Thousands of them.
[01:38:22.809 --> 01:38:30.351]  And so, if they do this, it's because they've been threatened and they don't want to be demonized by the media.
[01:38:31.547 --> 01:38:33.729]  That's what all this intimidation and all these attacks are about.
[01:38:34.529 --> 01:38:38.292]  It's about fear in this country, so that people go along with the takeover.
[01:38:38.332 --> 01:38:42.175]  And I'll assure you, it's only going to get 100 times worse with this type of activity.
[01:38:42.215 --> 01:38:44.237]  I mean, this is over the edge, over the top.
[01:38:45.778 --> 01:38:46.418]  We're in free fall.
[01:38:47.139 --> 01:38:48.200]  I want to take your calls.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:53.664]  I want to ask where you think this is going, what Trump needs to do, why is Trump not active when he should be.
[01:38:54.994 --> 01:38:55.735]  He's fighting back.
[01:38:56.115 --> 01:38:59.698]  He's being, you know, defiant to the tyranny, but he's not using that bully pulpit.
[01:39:00.819 --> 01:39:03.542]  And he says, he said yesterday, if I get the video, I forgot to play it.
[01:39:04.082 --> 01:39:11.169]  Yesterday, he said in a press conference, he walked out and said, well, you know, the courts don't rule in my favor or the electors don't.
[01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:12.670]  I'm running in four years.
[01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:13.571]  What does that mean?
[01:39:15.097 --> 01:39:16.237]  We need to fight this now.
[01:39:16.298 --> 01:39:19.119]  The globalists, if you think they stole this election, holy Toledo!
[01:39:19.679 --> 01:39:20.279]  Give me a break!
[01:39:20.779 --> 01:39:22.280]  They're never taking their foot off our neck.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:29.743]  Call for your number to join us.
[01:39:29.763 --> 01:39:30.023]  877-789-2539.
[01:39:30.043 --> 01:39:30.704]  877-789-2539.
[01:39:30.724 --> 01:39:31.224]  877-789-Alex.
[01:39:31.944 --> 01:39:32.704]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:39:33.085 --> 01:39:34.565]  Infowars.com's the site.
[01:39:34.885 --> 01:39:37.086]  Band.videos got all the band data.
[01:39:37.987 --> 01:39:43.329]  Well, they're having a big press conference with that amazing congressman in Georgia, state rep.
[01:39:44.312 --> 01:39:49.075]  Mr. Jones and Lynn Wood and, of course, Sidney Powell.
[01:39:49.696 --> 01:39:52.018]  We've got a live feed from Right Side Broadcasting.
[01:39:52.838 --> 01:39:54.039]  Isn't it great Right Side's there?
[01:39:54.119 --> 01:39:56.101]  Isn't it great OAN's there?
[01:39:56.161 --> 01:39:57.342]  Isn't it great Infowars is there?
[01:39:57.382 --> 01:39:58.843]  Isn't it great you're there to support them?
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:03.202]  Promo code PATRIOT, 10% off, on top of all the big discounts.
[01:40:03.562 --> 01:40:04.863]  It's only running until Monday.
[01:40:05.483 --> 01:40:07.484]  Promo code PATRIOT at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:40:07.744 --> 01:40:09.545]  Just want to remind you, you're the reason we're on air.
[01:40:09.625 --> 01:40:10.106]  Thank you.
[01:40:10.526 --> 01:40:12.207]  These are great products you and your family need.
[01:40:13.007 --> 01:40:14.208]  Especially for children, man.
[01:40:14.228 --> 01:40:15.549]  This fish roll is so good for children.
[01:40:15.829 --> 01:40:16.569]  So good for everybody.
[01:40:16.609 --> 01:40:18.591]  But man, I tell you, what it does for their brains.
[01:40:19.625 --> 01:40:21.306]  It's what your brain literally runs on.
[01:40:22.367 --> 01:40:24.328]  It's like the perfect thing compared to like sugar.
[01:40:24.728 --> 01:40:25.709]  Sugar's horrible for your brain.
[01:40:26.289 --> 01:40:27.790]  This is what it actually runs on.
[01:40:28.410 --> 01:40:29.211]  But I'm digressing.
[01:40:29.531 --> 01:40:30.952]  Let's go to a few minutes of the press conference.
[01:40:30.992 --> 01:40:32.553]  Len Wood's talking, then I'll go to your phone calls.
[01:40:37.676 --> 01:40:40.197]  It might have had a little bit of that feed cut out there, but we had it just about.
[01:40:40.277 --> 01:40:41.478]  And the message is this.
[01:40:42.859 --> 01:40:43.860]  It's 1776 in America again.
[01:40:50.197 --> 01:40:52.159]  And you're not going to take our freedom.
[01:40:52.979 --> 01:40:54.560]  We're going to fight for our liberty.
[01:40:55.221 --> 01:41:01.225]  We're going to send that message from Wills Park today, and we're going to send it all the way over to Beijing, China.
[01:41:01.445 --> 01:41:03.407]  We're not going to let you take our country over.
[01:41:03.847 --> 01:41:05.248]  Never going to happen on our watch.
[01:41:06.349 --> 01:41:07.410]  This is America.
[01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:10.272]  You picked a fight with the wrong people.
[01:41:24.922 --> 01:41:26.543]  1776 will commence again.
[01:41:26.943 --> 01:41:28.404]  We're going to send that message.
[01:41:29.805 --> 01:41:33.468]  We're going to send that message to George Soros.
[01:41:34.368 --> 01:41:36.390]  Get out of our country, George Soros!
[01:41:42.074 --> 01:41:48.838]  We are not going to allow ourselves to go back into the polling booth.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.662]  And you hear us out, Governor Kemp.
[01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:58.372]  You hear me while you hide in your closet.
[01:42:01.033 --> 01:42:02.053]  And you hear us.
[01:42:02.694 --> 01:42:04.835]  You hear the people, Brad Raffensperger.
[01:42:07.896 --> 01:42:11.498]  And I want Lieutenant Governor Jeffrey Duncan to hear it, too.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:17.241]  And the guy that's making a ton of money, Gabriel Sterling.
[01:42:17.421 --> 01:42:18.522]  You listen up, Gabriel.
[01:42:20.903 --> 01:42:24.125]  You're not going to sell our votes to China.
[01:42:26.533 --> 01:42:29.776]  We're not gonna vote on your damn machines made in China!
[01:42:31.777 --> 01:42:35.300]  We're gonna vote on machines made in the USA!
[01:42:37.862 --> 01:42:39.683]  Folks, there's no way the globals get away with this.
[01:42:39.703 --> 01:42:42.946]  I mean, they may try to install Biden, but it just makes it worse for them, I'm telling you.
[01:42:43.346 --> 01:42:44.167]  They're not playing chess.
[01:42:44.187 --> 01:42:45.448]  This is very dangerous.
[01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:52.914]  I mean... People are pissed, man.
[01:42:54.650 --> 01:42:56.952]  You don't think people like Lin Wood usually are acting like this to you?
[01:42:56.992 --> 01:42:58.173]  People are pissed, okay?
[01:42:58.433 --> 01:42:59.394]  It's wartime now.
[01:42:59.775 --> 01:43:00.195]  Continue.
[01:43:02.637 --> 01:43:09.704]  I believe that a great man one time called upon the black Americans to take action.
[01:43:11.025 --> 01:43:12.246]  We're not here for violence.
[01:43:13.788 --> 01:43:15.149]  But Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:19.093]  believed in non-violent civil disobedience.
[01:43:19.173 --> 01:43:20.134]  Civil disobedience.
[01:43:21.098 --> 01:43:22.839]  I want you to go to the governor's mansion.
[01:43:23.699 --> 01:43:24.839]  I want you to circle it.
[01:43:25.579 --> 01:43:32.521]  I want you to blow your horns until Brian Kemp comes out and orders a special session of the Georgia legislature.
[01:43:33.262 --> 01:43:41.084]  Get us our legislature and tell everybody we want our legislator to meet and we want him to fix the mess that he created.
[01:43:41.104 --> 01:43:42.845]  By the way, I'm told that crowd's like 5,000 people.
[01:43:42.925 --> 01:43:44.205]  And then he can resign.
[01:43:44.625 --> 01:43:45.465]  Notice our crowd was like 500.
[01:43:46.625 --> 01:43:48.066]  This is what leadership is.
[01:43:48.586 --> 01:43:49.786]  We had to go ignite it.
[01:43:50.506 --> 01:43:51.406]  You did it, listeners.
[01:43:51.586 --> 01:43:52.587]  Now others are doing it.
[01:43:52.627 --> 01:43:53.367]  I'm back in D.C.
[01:43:53.387 --> 01:43:53.847]  on the 12th.
[01:43:54.147 --> 01:43:55.987]  I'm in Dallas this Saturday speaking.
[01:43:56.047 --> 01:43:57.008]  But this is it, folks.
[01:43:57.048 --> 01:43:57.648]  This is history.
[01:43:57.948 --> 01:43:58.968]  Let's continue and we'll go to break.
[01:43:58.988 --> 01:43:59.468]  Take your calls.
[01:43:59.488 --> 01:43:59.748]  Go ahead.
[01:44:00.088 --> 01:44:01.508]  There's a few others that need to go with him.
[01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:12.431]  Now, everybody's been reading the media.
[01:44:12.451 --> 01:44:12.831]  Stop.
[01:44:12.991 --> 01:44:13.511]  It's a lie.
[01:44:17.515 --> 01:44:19.616]  Stick with OAN and Newsmax.
[01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:21.177]  They tell you the truth.
[01:44:22.978 --> 01:44:24.299]  Read the Epoch Times.
[01:44:24.739 --> 01:44:25.800]  They tell you the truth.
[01:44:27.721 --> 01:44:30.163]  This is the battle between good and evil.
[01:44:30.743 --> 01:44:35.025]  This is the battle between truth and lies.
[01:44:36.907 --> 01:44:41.489]  I'm going to introduce now a person that's going to tell you the truth.
[01:44:43.230 --> 01:44:45.532]  They want to know, where's your evidence?
[01:44:46.661 --> 01:44:47.563]  Show us your evidence.
[01:44:48.064 --> 01:44:49.426]  Oh, we're going to show them the evidence.
[01:44:49.746 --> 01:44:51.029]  There's piles of evidence.
[01:44:51.289 --> 01:44:52.611]  There's mountains of evidence.
[01:44:53.032 --> 01:44:56.257]  This election was a fraud on America.
[01:44:57.506 --> 01:45:04.211]  Donald Trump won a massive landslide victory unparalleled in the history of this country.
[01:45:05.072 --> 01:45:11.716]  And he's going to stay in the White House because we the people voted for him and we the people run this country.
[01:45:12.017 --> 01:45:15.839]  This country belongs to you and you and you and you.
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.501]  It belongs to the people!
[01:45:26.713 --> 01:45:35.398]  I challenged Governor Kemp to step up in front of the people, put his hand on this Bible, and tell us that he did not take money from China.
[01:45:35.718 --> 01:45:36.299]  He did!
[01:45:37.939 --> 01:45:39.480]  So did Brian Raffensperger.
[01:45:40.421 --> 01:45:49.146]  They won't put their hand on this Bible and swear to the contrary, because if they do, they will commit perjury, and there's another reason to lock them up.
[01:45:54.429 --> 01:45:56.070]  The person that's leading the charge
[01:45:58.669 --> 01:46:01.851]  I've been with her where she's worked 23 hours a day.
[01:46:03.791 --> 01:46:09.614]  I've seen the young people fighting for America under her charge and leadership.
[01:46:11.035 --> 01:46:18.478]  And let me tell you, you can call her the crackhead, but she's Sidney Powell!
[01:46:18.498 --> 01:46:19.239]  Come on up here, Sidney!
[01:46:32.401 --> 01:46:33.722]  All right, this is live now.
[01:46:35.143 --> 01:46:36.044]  But I'm going to pause it.
[01:46:36.484 --> 01:46:37.405]  We're going to save it here.
[01:46:38.266 --> 01:46:39.246]  And I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:46:39.507 --> 01:46:41.648]  And then I'm going to take 15 minutes from John Rappaport.
[01:46:41.668 --> 01:46:43.109]  He's got a big show lined up for you next hour.
[01:46:43.129 --> 01:46:46.632]  I'm going to play whatever Sidney Powell had to say for you via tape.
[01:46:47.173 --> 01:46:48.394]  But I want to hear what she has to say.
[01:46:48.434 --> 01:46:49.234]  I know you do as well.
[01:46:49.695 --> 01:46:52.417]  We've got the feed posted at InfoWars.com if you want to go watch that.
[01:46:52.577 --> 01:46:53.197]  I understand.
[01:46:55.519 --> 01:46:57.641]  It makes me feel really good hearing Lin Wood.
[01:46:59.042 --> 01:47:01.204]  And it makes me feel really good seeing all these people
[01:47:02.824 --> 01:47:10.608]  Who've been just like me and just like you the whole time, but have, but have sat in the shadows, quietly trying to defend the country.
[01:47:10.848 --> 01:47:16.170]  But, but now they're, they're as mad as a, as mad as a rooster with his tail on fire.
[01:47:17.911 --> 01:47:20.832]  And that's good because that's what it's going to take to turn this around.
[01:47:22.933 --> 01:47:25.675]  I knew this was coming 30 years ago.
[01:47:28.116 --> 01:47:30.317]  Because I read what the Globalist wrote decades ago.
[01:47:32.025 --> 01:47:34.006]  And I saw everything they said they'd do, they did.
[01:47:35.047 --> 01:47:39.390]  Now they say they're going to kill every human on earth and launch this new silicon creature.
[01:47:40.471 --> 01:47:43.413]  Whether they're going to be successful or not in that is up to us.
[01:47:44.394 --> 01:47:49.737]  And whether they can even do that, I'm sure it's some satanic fraud the devil's convinced them of, doesn't matter.
[01:47:50.298 --> 01:47:50.918]  They're trying it.
[01:47:51.118 --> 01:47:55.942]  And so, they take our kindness as weakness, it's not that.
[01:47:56.994 --> 01:47:58.634]  No, we're just figuring out what we're going to do.
[01:47:59.054 --> 01:48:05.416]  I'll be telling you about the Battle of Athens next hour and the blueprint for where this war is going if things get physical.
[01:48:06.176 --> 01:48:07.956]  Straight ahead, ties into election fraud.
[01:48:07.976 --> 01:48:12.477]  But right now, Carlos, long-time caller in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:48:12.517 --> 01:48:12.897]  Welcome.
[01:48:14.038 --> 01:48:14.738]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:16.098 --> 01:48:23.600]  There was a time when Benjamin Franklin was asked, what are you guys doing in that house there in Philadelphia?
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:24.780]  What are you working on?
[01:48:25.567 --> 01:48:26.528]  Conspiratorially.
[01:48:26.748 --> 01:48:30.610]  And he answered, well, we've just given you a republic, if you can keep it.
[01:48:31.691 --> 01:48:37.134]  There's a very big difference between a democratic approach and a republican approach.
[01:48:37.654 --> 01:48:40.656]  And you, sir, have a republic in your hands.
[01:48:41.116 --> 01:48:43.397]  Your constitution is one of a republic.
[01:48:43.938 --> 01:48:49.100]  What it means, it means that each individual, each American, is a sovereign.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:53.463]  And as sovereign, they select individuals to represent them.
[01:48:54.289 --> 01:49:02.151]  They have, of course, a supreme question about how they legislate themselves, and that is resolved by interpreting in the Supreme Court.
[01:49:02.751 --> 01:49:15.835]  But the supreme power, in the event of tyranny, in the event of, if you want to call it a communist assault, remains in the military, and the military chief is the President of the United States.
[01:49:17.921 --> 01:49:24.203]  Judicial system, you can say, well, you know, this was right, this was wrong, but you cannot say you're president.
[01:49:24.863 --> 01:49:27.123]  The people decided who was president.
[01:49:27.844 --> 01:49:29.344]  The votes were determinant.
[01:49:29.644 --> 01:49:35.486]  If you do not believe in God, at least believe in democracy, believe in the power of the individual to vote.
[01:49:35.746 --> 01:49:39.387]  When you disenfranchise the individual, you destroy the republic.
[01:49:40.127 --> 01:49:41.507]  And that is not acceptable.
[01:49:41.827 --> 01:49:43.668]  Let it be known from this day on.
[01:49:44.269 --> 01:49:55.373]  Well, that's right, and republics were so admired after ours that dictatorships call themselves the People's Republic of North Korea, Republic of China, Republic of the Congo, but they're dictatorships
[01:50:12.228 --> 01:50:15.791]  In our republic, 51% cannot vote to enslave the other 49%.
[01:50:16.451 --> 01:50:17.292]  So that's the republic.
[01:50:17.352 --> 01:50:30.502]  It limits the democracy, enshrines the pillars of the system, separation of powers, and clearly with China's involvement and clearly what the Democrats said Trump did, which he didn't do, now they've done exactly what they said Trump did.
[01:50:31.463 --> 01:50:32.764]  Trump must come out.
[01:50:33.681 --> 01:50:38.203]  And just call the American people to stand up and say no and call for civil disobedience.
[01:50:38.903 --> 01:50:42.184]  He needs to go to war with these folks instead of rolling over.
[01:50:42.285 --> 01:50:48.107]  And I'm really concerned that he's leaving it in the hands of these lawyers because the courts are saying, oh, don't be political.
[01:50:48.147 --> 01:50:49.087]  We might rule for you.
[01:50:49.507 --> 01:50:50.448]  Well, don't be political.
[01:50:50.488 --> 01:50:51.668]  The whole thing is political.
[01:50:52.068 --> 01:50:54.029]  We don't accept Joe Biden.
[01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:55.230]  Not just the mountains of fraud.
[01:50:56.141 --> 01:50:58.681]  But the fact that he's a Chinese agent, he's illegitimate.
[01:50:59.041 --> 01:51:06.083]  My God, he's stumbling around wearing a clown outfit.
[01:51:06.443 --> 01:51:07.443]  This is a joke.
[01:51:08.203 --> 01:51:10.843]  And it just cannot and it will not happen.
[01:51:11.124 --> 01:51:13.704]  And that's why we, the people, have to say no.
[01:51:14.104 --> 01:51:18.185]  And Trump has to understand that fortune favors the bold.
[01:51:18.745 --> 01:51:24.266]  And as a great playwright once wrote in his William Shakespeare's
[01:51:29.087 --> 01:51:30.808]  We're good to go.
[01:51:53.917 --> 01:52:05.405]  Have that 1776 moment and say, Declaration of Independence Part II, we declare that you're illegitimate and not go along with it and sweep these globalist scum and these cowardly lawyers aside.
[01:52:05.765 --> 01:52:08.747]  If we don't, they intend like Lilliputians,
[01:52:10.083 --> 01:52:15.728]  And Gulliver's travels to tie us down if they put their weak dictator in.
[01:52:16.068 --> 01:52:22.774]  I mean, if folks think this is just gonna blow over and, well, all the trouble's gonna be over as soon as Trump's gone, don't hold your breath, folks.
[01:52:23.234 --> 01:52:25.336]  I am telling you, all hell!
[01:52:26.952 --> 01:52:27.932]  Economic collapse.
[01:52:27.952 --> 01:52:30.573]  They're already saying, oh, gas prices are going to explode.
[01:52:30.853 --> 01:52:32.974]  Joe Biden's going to get rid of the strategic oil reserves.
[01:52:33.534 --> 01:52:35.415]  He is there to gut us.
[01:52:35.975 --> 01:52:36.435]  Period.
[01:52:36.855 --> 01:52:42.497]  Carlos, so if we don't stand up for ourselves when we're being assaulted, we get what we deserve, Carlos.
[01:52:43.557 --> 01:52:46.378]  Well, Alex, let me just finish by telling you something.
[01:52:46.978 --> 01:52:50.899]  What Biden represents is going back to what Trump pointed out.
[01:52:51.279 --> 01:52:52.900]  You lose your jobs to foreigners.
[01:52:53.573 --> 01:52:59.475]  You will not even have your own parts in your military to defend yourselves in the moment of truth.
[01:52:59.975 --> 01:53:06.397]  And what he was basically saying is that let the Republican spirit lead the world to globalism.
[01:53:06.537 --> 01:53:11.118]  Eventually, the whole world would unite in a Republican way, the power of the individual.
[01:53:11.698 --> 01:53:14.279]  The antithesis of that is communism.
[01:53:14.659 --> 01:53:18.760]  Communism is an inversion, and it's an inversion that's reflected in people.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:20.901]  Look, the devil's wives
[01:53:21.667 --> 01:53:22.067]  I think so.
[01:53:37.788 --> 01:53:40.691]  We have more children, the more impoverished we become.
[01:53:41.071 --> 01:53:43.314]  Because that's the only survival biology has.
[01:53:43.834 --> 01:53:46.597]  So, this individual is totally inverse and ignorant.
[01:53:46.937 --> 01:53:51.582]  What you've got to do is to give power and influence to individuals.
[01:53:51.602 --> 01:53:52.943]  Well, let's go further though.
[01:53:53.244 --> 01:53:54.024]  He's not ignorant.
[01:53:55.125 --> 01:54:04.092]  If you read the Royal Commission 49, that's the model of all this, they said, if we industrialize the third world, they'll stabilize 2.1 children, but that won't give us total control.
[01:54:04.112 --> 01:54:17.182]  We're going to balloon their populations, use them to de-industrialize the West, then use the third world in reverse colonialism to flood the first world and lower the entire world population standard to a permanent managed class that we control.
[01:54:17.382 --> 01:54:19.624]  So it's all just cold-blooded evil, brother.
[01:54:20.666 --> 01:54:24.249]  Let them reduce themselves first, and then I will consider their option.
[01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:24.950]  Exactly.
[01:54:24.970 --> 01:54:32.917]  If Ted Turner and Bill Gates walked out on TV and blew their brains out, or took cyanide, I would start respecting them.
[01:54:33.418 --> 01:54:34.859]  But he wants me to die?
[01:54:34.919 --> 01:54:35.640]  He wants you to die?
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:36.220]  No!
[01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:41.345]  To quote Emperor Palpatine, no, no, no, no, you will die!
[01:54:41.365 --> 01:54:44.288]  It ain't gonna happen.
[01:54:44.568 --> 01:54:45.209]  It's America.
[01:54:47.012 --> 01:54:48.673]  I'm just telling you, they're playing with fire, man.
[01:54:50.054 --> 01:54:56.778]  It's unbelievable, and when America realizes that the lockdown's permanent, when they realize, I mean, it's just, it's insane.
[01:54:57.398 --> 01:54:57.879]  God bless you.
[01:54:57.979 --> 01:54:59.340]  All right, I spent most of the time with one caller.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:00.160]  Let me get another caller here.
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:01.201]  This is a great caller.
[01:55:01.521 --> 01:55:03.202]  Jason in New Mexico, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:55:04.335 --> 01:55:05.776]  Thank you for taking my call, Mr. Jones.
[01:55:05.816 --> 01:55:06.857]  I'll be real brief.
[01:55:07.198 --> 01:55:15.024]  These demons are playing a confidence game, and the Democrats and the globalists have intentionally created a constitutional crisis.
[01:55:15.425 --> 01:55:19.248]  We're waiting for AG Barr to do something, but it's out of his jurisdiction.
[01:55:19.548 --> 01:55:23.512]  Just like Carlos said, it's up to the military, and Trump is our commander-in-chief.
[01:55:23.892 --> 01:55:29.954]  Nevertheless, if there is an executive order, as we know there is regarding the election, there's nothing that Barr can do.
[01:55:30.254 --> 01:55:35.516]  But what we're doing right now is we are finally bringing the Constitution to the forefront again.
[01:55:35.876 --> 01:55:38.217]  And America is reviving the Constitution.
[01:55:38.517 --> 01:55:43.059]  And in addition to that... Sir, I mean, listen, I don't want to put perfume on a pig, but you're absolutely right.
[01:55:43.519 --> 01:55:47.140]  I mean, this is pissing people off at a level ten times what I've ever seen.
[01:55:49.227 --> 01:55:50.829]  So it's beyond that.
[01:55:50.889 --> 01:55:54.493]  It's like the great Mr. Roger Stone, how he gave his life to Christ.
[01:55:54.733 --> 01:55:56.715]  Well, that's exactly what's going on right now.
[01:55:56.796 --> 01:56:01.681]  God is initiating a massive revival because we're seeing the wickedness of the hearts.
[01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:03.523]  We're seeing the control that we have been under.
[01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:06.046]  But like Dr. P says, Dr. Burchenek,
[01:56:06.406 --> 01:56:09.389]  It's the art of war, and God has drawn out the enemy.
[01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:14.113]  Now they are completely exposed, completely uncovered, and there's nothing that they can do.
[01:56:14.373 --> 01:56:16.135]  And Trump doesn't have to do another thing.
[01:56:16.495 --> 01:56:20.158]  We the people will do the rest, like Glenwood just said.
[01:56:20.458 --> 01:56:29.166]  And so I will say this, the declaration of war date is January 11, 2021, according to the executive order that was revived
[01:56:29.546 --> 01:56:30.647]  September 12, 2020.
[01:56:31.348 --> 01:56:33.529]  Trump knows what's up, but do we know what's up?
[01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:34.270]  Are we ready?
[01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:40.215]  Are we the people ready to take this country back from the globalists that have controlled it since the 1890s?
[01:56:40.235 --> 01:56:43.197]  So you're saying he's not up there commanding the forces.
[01:56:43.277 --> 01:56:44.238]  He wants it to be organic.
[01:56:44.558 --> 01:56:45.599]  He's leaving it in our hands.
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:46.520]  I hear you.
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:47.281]  That's what he's doing, yeah.
[01:56:47.921 --> 01:56:50.541]  Well, we better hit the streets then, like Linwood's doing and like we're doing.
[01:56:50.862 --> 01:56:52.502]  Thank you so much for your wise words, Jason.
[01:56:52.522 --> 01:56:52.902]  We love you.
[01:56:53.322 --> 01:56:54.442]  Alright, more amazing folks.
[01:56:54.502 --> 01:56:55.202]  I love you all.
[01:56:55.542 --> 01:57:01.163]  Truth Dealer, Deshawn, Wes, John, Dan, James, Charles, your calls are all coming up.
[01:57:01.203 --> 01:57:02.264]  Resistance, stay with us.
[01:57:04.744 --> 01:57:06.004]  You know, I love Ted Nugent.
[01:57:07.204 --> 01:57:08.725]  And he is, him and his wife are awesome.
[01:57:09.265 --> 01:57:13.766]  Not name dropping, they basically invited me over for Thanksgiving when I was already out of town.
[01:57:13.786 --> 01:57:15.286]  It's just awesome.
[01:57:19.653 --> 01:57:20.374]  I got a cool job.
[01:57:21.314 --> 01:57:23.656]  You know, uh, Joe Rogan is on the show tomorrow.
[01:57:24.777 --> 01:57:24.937]  Yep.
[01:57:25.038 --> 01:57:25.818]  Right here in studio.
[01:57:27.219 --> 01:57:27.920]  So look for that.
[01:57:28.841 --> 01:57:30.062]  And a lot of other surprises.
[01:57:33.585 --> 01:57:43.393]  You know, I've known Steve Pucinich for 19 years and I knew he was in the CFR and I knew that, uh, he did run the overthrow of multiple governments.
[01:57:43.413 --> 01:57:46.856]  That's in the congressional record and a lot of other things.
[01:57:48.385 --> 01:57:50.866]  And pretty much everything he ever told me turned out to be very accurate.
[01:57:53.528 --> 01:58:01.492]  But I just, I believe he was told by high-level folks in the CIA that Trump's done this sting and they're all gonna, the globals are all gonna get in trouble.
[01:58:02.653 --> 01:58:08.236]  I just wonder if they're feeding him a lot of bull because, man, I mean, you saw what Barr came out and did and everything else.
[01:58:08.716 --> 01:58:13.119]  I just, I'm not up here saying we're out of the woods and I'm not up here saying that.
[01:58:13.159 --> 01:58:14.139]  I'm not disagreeing with him.
[01:58:14.199 --> 01:58:16.841]  I'm not saying, I think he's a disingenuous person or a liar.
[01:58:18.624 --> 01:58:20.145]  I just, you know, I have a bad feeling.
[01:58:20.465 --> 01:58:27.530]  But I get what the last caller said, where it doesn't matter, people are waking up, and Trump seems super confident.
[01:58:29.651 --> 01:58:33.674]  He sounds like happier than ever, so I know one thing for sure.
[01:58:33.694 --> 01:58:35.595]  49 days, baby.
[01:58:38.337 --> 01:58:40.318]  We're in the 79 days of hell right now, aren't we?
[01:58:41.759 --> 01:58:43.660]  There's the video, it's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:45.049 --> 01:58:48.810]  With 500 plus thousand views, Steve Pucinich doubles down.
[01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:52.311]  Trump's sting operation against deep state election fraud going well.
[01:58:53.491 --> 01:58:57.072]  And by the way, he wasn't joking when he said China called him.
[01:58:57.392 --> 01:59:02.273]  Pucinich has sent me video and photos when he's in North Korea hanging out with the North Koreans.
[01:59:03.074 --> 01:59:04.214]  I mean, he gets around, folks.
[01:59:05.334 --> 01:59:06.594]  And so I'll just leave it at that.
[01:59:12.199 --> 01:59:18.404]  He says Beijing, you know, high level operatives call him and they're like, yeah, you know, we know Trump's going to win.
[01:59:18.904 --> 01:59:27.731]  You notice Putin won't congratulate Biden and neither will the Mexican president who had an election stolen from him and had such a landslide later.
[01:59:27.751 --> 01:59:31.254]  Cause that's what happens when you steal one, the next election is a bigger landslide.
[01:59:31.554 --> 01:59:34.136]  Problem is the Mexicans have elections every two years.
[01:59:34.777 --> 01:59:36.738]  They can do different procedures where one gets called.
[01:59:37.119 --> 01:59:41.262]  I mean, Trump could wait two years and went even bigger, but man, four years, there won't be a country left.
[01:59:45.171 --> 01:59:51.514]  So we'll see what happens, but mountains of evidence.
[01:59:51.694 --> 01:59:57.356]  All right, let's go to Truth Dealer in Ohio.
[01:59:57.416 --> 01:59:58.516]  Go ahead.
[02:00:00.077 --> 02:00:01.177]  Alex, God bless you, brother.
[02:00:01.878 --> 02:00:02.198]  Thank you.
[02:00:03.278 --> 02:00:05.919]  I'd like to make an important point, and then I'd like to give you a plug.
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:08.000]  We're at the precipice here.
[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:14.803]  This is either the end or our finest hour, and I believe in my heart of hearts, this will be our finest hour.
[02:00:15.533 --> 02:00:20.759]  Alex, you remember during the Battle of Jericho, God had the Israelites stay silent for six days.
[02:00:21.259 --> 02:00:30.429]  He was making sure that the people weren't sowing seeds of doubt to spoil the power of the Holy Spirit before it came to knock the walls down.
[02:00:30.849 --> 02:00:35.855]  Even Jesus in Mark 6-5 couldn't work miracles when people had disbelief.
[02:00:36.395 --> 02:00:38.298]  I really believe we've got to stay tight here.
[02:00:38.338 --> 02:00:39.920]  A slip of the lip could sink the ship.
[02:00:40.241 --> 02:00:41.422]  We've got to be steadfast.
[02:00:41.523 --> 02:00:46.189]  Remember, it's not by might or by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord.
[02:00:46.530 --> 02:00:48.252]  So keep spreading the truth, people.
[02:00:48.612 --> 02:00:49.954]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:55.270]  Do you want it to be the other way?
[02:00:55.311 --> 02:00:56.552]  You have to believe this.
[02:00:57.033 --> 02:00:59.056]  This is all a confidence operation by the enemy.
[02:00:59.416 --> 02:01:00.658]  We have to say we're winning.
[02:01:00.818 --> 02:01:01.839]  We have to not give up.
[02:01:01.859 --> 02:01:02.400]  And he's right.
[02:01:03.001 --> 02:01:05.284]  So we can get into the sophistication of it and the fraud.
[02:01:05.745 --> 02:01:08.188]  And they didn't want Barr to have to come out and stab Trump in the back.
[02:01:08.508 --> 02:01:10.451]  The fact that he did that meant they're in trouble.
[02:01:10.471 --> 02:01:10.952]  They're scared.
[02:01:11.954 --> 02:01:14.615]  It doesn't matter how many Judases come through the woodwork.
[02:01:14.775 --> 02:01:17.637]  I believe that Joe Biden is a modern-day Absalom.
[02:01:17.677 --> 02:01:19.698]  He's having a false claim to the throne.
[02:01:20.098 --> 02:01:22.639]  He is not God's choice during this time.
[02:01:22.879 --> 02:01:27.181]  And I also want to say to the listeners, people, you gotta support new platforms.
[02:01:27.761 --> 02:01:34.603]  I worked in television and news for 10 years, but I'm moving all my videos from YouTube to Rumble.
[02:01:34.883 --> 02:01:39.384]  You can find me at YouTube.com or Rumble.com slash TruthDealer.
[02:01:39.944 --> 02:01:42.664]  And Alex and InfoWarriors, I want to give you a plug.
[02:01:43.005 --> 02:01:44.245]  I love Alpha Power.
[02:01:44.625 --> 02:01:47.726]  Take Alpha Power, then watch our Be a Man video.
[02:01:47.886 --> 02:01:52.807]  Alex, I swear you'll be ready to take on six Antifa members with one hand tied behind your back.
[02:01:53.027 --> 02:01:53.787]  We're going to win this.
[02:01:54.565 --> 02:01:55.145]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:01:55.185 --> 02:01:57.646]  Yeah, I don't have time to get into the ingredients of the products.
[02:01:58.426 --> 02:02:01.186]  It's got a bunch of patented, certified, highest end.
[02:02:01.507 --> 02:02:06.348]  We just go out and say, what is the most certified, most loved, most powerful stuff?
[02:02:06.908 --> 02:02:07.868]  And then we just go put it out.
[02:02:08.808 --> 02:02:10.108]  I mean, look, I'll be honest with you.
[02:02:10.309 --> 02:02:11.369]  I can't take Alpha Power.
[02:02:12.409 --> 02:02:13.929]  I can't take Super Bowl Vitality.
[02:02:13.989 --> 02:02:15.190]  I obviously don't need it.
[02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:17.950]  But I mean, I don't want to get graphic.
[02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:21.071]  It's a family show, but I don't need to be walking around with, you know,
[02:02:23.395 --> 02:02:24.555]  Something going on downstairs.
[02:02:24.675 --> 02:02:24.956]  Okay.
[02:02:25.076 --> 02:02:28.957]  I mean, I mean, if I take it, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:02:28.997 --> 02:02:30.337]  It's like waking up at 4 a.m.
[02:02:30.397 --> 02:02:30.877]  or 5 a.m.
[02:02:30.897 --> 02:02:32.898]  You know, you've got an erection.
[02:02:33.638 --> 02:02:34.738]  And it's the same thing.
[02:02:34.818 --> 02:02:37.559]  Like, as we're taking alpha powers of real vitality, it's like ridiculous.
[02:02:38.179 --> 02:02:39.179]  And I mean, I just can't do it.
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:40.980]  But these are real products, folks.
[02:02:42.472 --> 02:02:43.713]  And people go, oh, how dare you?
[02:02:44.114 --> 02:02:45.756]  Jones sells ding-dong pills.
[02:02:46.056 --> 02:02:47.097]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:02:47.437 --> 02:02:50.781]  They are hitting us with estrogen and chemicals to lower our male potential.
[02:02:51.522 --> 02:02:53.624]  And so we supplement and boost it up.
[02:02:54.425 --> 02:02:56.867]  Now, I eat so much red meat and, you know, stuff like that.
[02:02:56.927 --> 02:02:57.788]  I'm under so much stress.
[02:02:57.868 --> 02:02:59.050]  I'm pumping hormones out.
[02:03:00.411 --> 02:03:01.272]  But, I mean, let me tell you.
[02:03:01.292 --> 02:03:02.073]  Let me tell you.
[02:03:02.553 --> 02:03:02.573]  X2.
[02:03:04.392 --> 02:03:09.756]  I remember Dr. Grips said, you need to take iodine, you know, this is a pure crystal source and all this, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[02:03:09.796 --> 02:03:15.541]  And I remember hippies, when I was a kid, would be at Barton Springs with big gallon jugs of water, and I'd say, what is that?
[02:03:15.561 --> 02:03:17.042]  He says, it's brown.
[02:03:18.243 --> 02:03:24.788]  They'd have regular store-bought crappy iodine, but these guys were all like, you know, super swimmers, like old dudes with gray hair with their bodies like they were 25.
[02:03:24.868 --> 02:03:28.291]  And they were like, it's the essential thing, it's the good halogen.
[02:03:28.852 --> 02:03:31.534]  And man, as soon as I went on, I had these liver spots.
[02:03:32.679 --> 02:03:33.380]  Those went away.
[02:03:35.001 --> 02:03:36.463]  I lost because I was the biggest back then.
[02:03:36.503 --> 02:03:36.643]  I was 280.
[02:03:36.923 --> 02:03:39.366]  I like, slowly started losing weight.
[02:03:39.426 --> 02:03:39.686]  I'm like 230.
[02:03:40.647 --> 02:03:43.430]  I've done a lot gain like 20-30 pounds back, but I'm not as big as I was.
[02:03:44.891 --> 02:03:46.913]  But it's like magic what it did.
[02:03:46.993 --> 02:03:53.400]  Because even the UN admits, they're the big authority, but they admit 2 plus million people have neurological disorders.
[02:03:55.555 --> 02:03:57.096]  And have lower IQs.
[02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:58.076]  What's the exact quote?
[02:03:58.797 --> 02:04:02.218]  Have a cognitive disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:04:03.079 --> 02:04:04.119]  I mean, wow!
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:08.341]  X2, X3 are for the internal.
[02:04:08.381 --> 02:04:09.702]  We have super strong
[02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:16.320]  Um, iodine surface spray that is, you know, medical grade, super frickin strong, not for ingestion.
[02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:17.121]  It's, it's poison.
[02:04:17.941 --> 02:04:21.384]  Uh, but, but we've got that and we've got the Alpha Power back in stock.
[02:04:21.404 --> 02:04:22.104]  They're just amazing.
[02:04:22.164 --> 02:04:27.468]  Promo code Patriot gets an additional 10% off the already big discounts and it will have to end on Monday.
[02:04:27.488 --> 02:04:28.669]  I have to end the sales sometime.
[02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:32.051]  So we sell a lot more product, but then the accountant's like, but there's less money.
[02:04:32.472 --> 02:04:35.094]  And so next week we just got to go back to regular sales.
[02:04:35.774 --> 02:04:37.994]  We'll have a few things on sale for Christmas, but I need your support.
[02:04:38.035 --> 02:04:38.935]  Promo code PATRIOT.
[02:04:38.955 --> 02:04:40.815]  10% off additional info at worstore.com.
[02:04:41.295 --> 02:04:41.695]  Okay!
[02:04:45.616 --> 02:04:47.156]  Deshawn in California.
[02:04:47.196 --> 02:04:47.677]  Thanks for holding.
[02:04:47.717 --> 02:04:48.037]  Go ahead.
[02:04:50.437 --> 02:04:50.937]  Hello, Alec.
[02:04:51.597 --> 02:04:51.837]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:51.857 --> 02:04:52.198]  Go ahead.
[02:04:53.278 --> 02:04:58.639]  Yeah, I'm gonna just be real brief because my phone kind of breaking up, but they kind of excited him to
[02:04:59.341 --> 02:04:59.621]  No, I agree.
[02:04:59.661 --> 02:05:01.082]  They want to break this.
[02:05:01.102 --> 02:05:03.664]  They are foaming at the mouth to kill us.
[02:05:03.944 --> 02:05:05.065]  Because it's a spiritual thing.
[02:05:05.085 --> 02:05:05.265]  I agree.
[02:05:05.325 --> 02:05:06.746]  Tell me what your gut tells you.
[02:05:29.548 --> 02:05:31.929]  Oh man, it's going to fall like Ukraine if Joe Biden gets in.
[02:05:32.309 --> 02:05:37.631]  He's going to go against the American patriots, the white people of the country that he hates.
[02:05:37.711 --> 02:05:38.211]  They hate us.
[02:05:38.551 --> 02:05:41.532]  That's why they robbed the whole bill with the votes.
[02:05:41.912 --> 02:05:44.173]  All the white people right there voted Trump in.
[02:05:44.453 --> 02:05:45.473]  We've seen it that night.
[02:05:45.813 --> 02:05:49.894]  But he's going to cause war against the white patriots as soon as he gets in office.
[02:05:50.394 --> 02:05:54.996]  And then, maybe, I think... No, I agree, to try to trick white people to attack black people.
[02:05:56.141 --> 02:06:01.234]  No, it ain't about black and white, because we... No, I know, but I'm saying they're trying to trick us to kill each other, though.
[02:06:02.509 --> 02:06:04.730]  Well, black people, well, they know what's going on.
[02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:08.891]  But these people that's in top, they don't like their own color, man.
[02:06:09.231 --> 02:06:10.411]  They want to kill y'all.
[02:06:10.631 --> 02:06:15.833]  And you can see by the news, they're mad because everybody's leaving Facebook and Twitter and we're going to gather another thing.
[02:06:16.193 --> 02:06:17.653]  They like chasing us over there.
[02:06:17.933 --> 02:06:19.454]  They know how the Patriots are moving.
[02:06:19.714 --> 02:06:21.454]  They are following us and they want to kill us.
[02:06:21.474 --> 02:06:22.594]  That's it.
[02:06:22.714 --> 02:06:26.475]  Either Trump saves the republic or the Democrats are going to have it forever.
[02:06:26.796 --> 02:06:27.956]  No, I totally agree.
[02:06:28.376 --> 02:06:29.797]  And I can't believe how epic it is.
[02:06:29.817 --> 02:06:32.438]  What would you call the point in history we're in right now, sir?
[02:06:33.718 --> 02:06:35.859]  This is the revolutionary moment right here.
[02:06:35.899 --> 02:06:36.359]  This is it.
[02:06:36.859 --> 02:06:37.460]  This is it.
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.781]  The Democrats had no choice but to steal it.
[02:06:40.101 --> 02:06:41.401]  The Democrat Party was dead.
[02:06:41.461 --> 02:06:41.921]  That was it.
[02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:43.102]  They was going to die right here.
[02:06:43.482 --> 02:06:44.482]  That's why they took it.
[02:06:45.083 --> 02:06:47.944]  The Democrat Party was going to be voted out forever off of this.
[02:06:48.004 --> 02:06:49.204]  I've never heard such truth.
[02:06:49.585 --> 02:06:52.146]  You're one zillion percent accurate, sir.
[02:06:52.206 --> 02:06:53.306]  Damn right.
[02:06:53.406 --> 02:06:54.647]  Everybody sees this as a failure.
[02:06:54.687 --> 02:06:56.147]  We forced them to steal this, man.
[02:06:56.727 --> 02:06:57.007]  Wow.
[02:06:57.048 --> 02:06:57.628]  We'll be right back.
[02:06:57.648 --> 02:06:57.988]  Stay with us.
[02:06:59.446 --> 02:07:01.787]  It is not the destination, it is the journey.
[02:07:03.307 --> 02:07:05.227]  To test, my friends, and it's real.
[02:07:07.308 --> 02:07:08.248]  It's my only advice.
[02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:12.529]  Look at Jeff Zucker, look at you!
[02:07:13.489 --> 02:07:14.289]  You think you're in control?
[02:07:14.309 --> 02:07:20.871]  Ah, bless your soul!
[02:07:20.891 --> 02:07:25.092]  You think you're in control?
[02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:35.872]  You guys think you're in control?
[02:07:35.892 --> 02:07:37.253]  You're in control and shit!
[02:07:38.313 --> 02:07:40.335]  Fuck you CNN and fuck you Bill Gates!
[02:07:43.036 --> 02:07:47.899]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:07:51.282 --> 02:07:52.342]  Alright, let's go to the calls.
[02:07:52.382 --> 02:07:53.583]  I'm out of control, I apologize.
[02:07:53.623 --> 02:07:54.764]  Walt in New York, go ahead.
[02:07:56.065 --> 02:07:56.925]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:07:57.586 --> 02:08:01.128]  Man, I'm just... I'm going next level crazy.
[02:08:02.045 --> 02:08:04.626]  Alex, I like where you're sitting, but we forced them to take the field.
[02:08:04.966 --> 02:08:14.230]  Now we got them down to where people are going to put their face behind it and swear on everything that's sacred that it was a free and fair election.
[02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:16.852]  They're going to certify with their name, their honor.
[02:08:17.052 --> 02:08:18.332]  What are they going to tell their children?
[02:08:18.352 --> 02:08:19.993]  What are they going to tell their grandchildren?
[02:08:20.763 --> 02:08:22.585]  And what you're saying is so important because here's the deal.
[02:08:22.605 --> 02:08:24.166]  I'm not telling people stuff's gonna get horrible.
[02:08:35.976 --> 02:08:37.657]  Just so they get scared and keep Biden out.
[02:08:37.958 --> 02:08:40.059]  Biden, they're going to cut the power off.
[02:08:40.079 --> 02:08:41.480]  They're going to cut the coal plants off.
[02:08:41.721 --> 02:08:42.902]  They're going to shut everything down.
[02:08:42.962 --> 02:08:44.343]  He says he's going to shut it.
[02:08:44.403 --> 02:08:45.744]  I mean, they're already announcing.
[02:08:46.244 --> 02:08:50.548]  We're going to be in a depression with that crazy person running things.
[02:08:51.949 --> 02:08:52.550]  Unbelievable.
[02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:58.714]  Do you know that in the last couple years, China poured more concrete than the whole United States in its history?
[02:08:58.734 --> 02:08:59.194]  Yes.
[02:08:59.675 --> 02:09:03.598]  And one ton of concrete takes one ton of coal to produce.
[02:09:03.818 --> 02:09:07.220]  And they didn't use scrubbers and they didn't use bag rooms to clean that coal.
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:07.841]  They're just
[02:09:08.522 --> 02:09:12.485]  Belching it out, and we're supposed to be, you know, biting the bullet?
[02:09:12.785 --> 02:09:13.446]  Are you kidding me?
[02:09:13.906 --> 02:09:14.606]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:09:14.887 --> 02:09:17.428]  Ours are 100% clean with the scrubbers.
[02:09:18.049 --> 02:09:29.217]  As you said, you look at a Chinese plant, it's the system that turns the centrifuges and the, you know, the boil the water or whatever, and turn the crank.
[02:09:29.437 --> 02:09:31.899]  It's just like a hydroelectric dam that uses pressure, but it uses heat.
[02:09:31.919 --> 02:09:33.180]  And then they have other systems.
[02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:35.762]  The point is, I'm not an engineer, but I've read all the reports on it.
[02:09:36.722 --> 02:09:39.846]  Imagine they just have the smokestack and that's it.
[02:09:40.187 --> 02:09:43.471]  They have nothing and they're belching it all out and then we can have nothing.
[02:09:43.491 --> 02:09:44.652]  We can have no power.
[02:09:44.952 --> 02:09:55.906]  He ran on literally making it impossible to have a business or have inexpensive power and it will bankrupt us and his average idiot followers actually think that's a good thing.
[02:09:56.738 --> 02:10:06.223]  Well, the public is deceived, but these individuals, I want to speak to the individual hearts and minds of the electors and the legislators, like Roger was saying, it goes to the legislators.
[02:10:06.783 --> 02:10:16.688]  These people, they're human beings, they're in public life, and they're putting their name, they've sworn a Bible to defend the nation and the Constitution against all enemies, domestic and foreign.
[02:10:16.928 --> 02:10:21.871]  And then after they swear that, they certify that something is absolutely false is true.
[02:10:22.371 --> 02:10:25.112]  I don't see how, as an honorable human being, you can do that.
[02:10:25.553 --> 02:10:26.293]  I can't believe it.
[02:10:27.614 --> 02:10:28.315]  I hear you brother.
[02:10:28.495 --> 02:10:33.099]  All I know is they're going to remove Biden right away and then put Kamala in.
[02:10:33.479 --> 02:10:35.261]  And that woman, no one likes her.
[02:10:35.641 --> 02:10:41.586]  She had less than half a percentage point support with Democrats and 0.1% with Blacks.
[02:10:41.906 --> 02:10:46.310]  Blacks see through her like a clear window.
[02:10:46.450 --> 02:10:48.031]  I mean, I don't, why did they pick her?
[02:10:48.052 --> 02:10:50.554]  They put it in your face.
[02:10:51.134 --> 02:10:53.516]  They would say, you're going to take whoever we put in front of you.
[02:10:53.556 --> 02:10:54.277]  That's your leader.
[02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:58.252]  But we have to say, no, we elected somebody else.
[02:10:58.812 --> 02:10:59.232]  That's right.
[02:11:00.032 --> 02:11:00.672]  We'll be right back.
[02:11:00.692 --> 02:11:01.032]  Stay with us.
[02:11:01.052 --> 02:11:01.493]  God bless you.
[02:11:02.953 --> 02:11:03.753]  Take heart, folks.
[02:11:03.813 --> 02:11:06.974]  Things are bad, but now they're out in the open.
[02:11:11.375 --> 02:11:14.576]  All right, we got some Sidney Powell speech I want to get to, but I want to get to your calls as well.
[02:11:14.636 --> 02:11:16.676]  Josh in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:11:16.696 --> 02:11:19.677]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:11:20.297 --> 02:11:22.497]  Man, I am just on the edge of my seat.
[02:11:23.298 --> 02:11:24.618]  I mean, everything is so crazy now.
[02:11:25.987 --> 02:11:32.272]  Jesus said, I have come not to bring peace but a sword, and I feel that that's the time we're in now.
[02:11:32.332 --> 02:11:47.686]  When we see half of this country at least embraces socialism, I don't see anything else to do but draw the line in the sand, or else we're going to lose it all.
[02:11:48.610 --> 02:11:49.511]  Oh, I agree.
[02:11:49.531 --> 02:11:51.333]  That's why I have to draw a line in the sand.
[02:11:51.353 --> 02:11:52.414]  So I say, what is that line?
[02:11:52.954 --> 02:11:53.415]  What do we do?
[02:11:53.455 --> 02:11:54.416]  It's decision time.
[02:11:54.856 --> 02:12:00.222]  Because if we let them get in, their agenda is breaking us with a great reset.
[02:12:00.382 --> 02:12:03.105]  I mean, they admit they plan to break us.
[02:12:03.525 --> 02:12:04.166]  Well, I'm sorry.
[02:12:04.186 --> 02:12:05.767]  You come to my house to break me.
[02:12:06.068 --> 02:12:06.988]  You're about to get a fight.
[02:12:07.469 --> 02:12:09.971]  So I'm having to think, like, what do I do as a father, as a man?
[02:12:10.812 --> 02:12:14.034]  Because I'm not scared of them, and I'm not scared of getting killed.
[02:12:14.234 --> 02:12:15.895]  I'm scared of making a mistake.
[02:12:16.215 --> 02:12:16.915]  But here's the deal.
[02:12:17.176 --> 02:12:18.676]  The real mistake is being paralyzed.
[02:12:18.917 --> 02:12:19.557]  So what do we do?
[02:12:21.538 --> 02:12:22.679]  Here's what we do.
[02:12:23.339 --> 02:12:30.123]  When they put Joe Biden in power, I already have the website ready to go, takeoverdc.com.
[02:12:30.383 --> 02:12:30.643]  Love it.
[02:12:30.683 --> 02:12:32.644]  We're going to do with what you guys did.
[02:12:33.539 --> 02:12:35.480]  However, everybody needs to be out there.
[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:37.260]  We need to set up supply lines.
[02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:38.181]  We need to camp.
[02:12:38.681 --> 02:12:39.721]  We need to take care of those.
[02:12:39.801 --> 02:12:40.321]  Come out there.
[02:12:40.401 --> 02:12:40.881]  No, I agree.
[02:12:41.021 --> 02:12:42.222]  In fact, I've already decided.
[02:12:42.322 --> 02:12:43.442]  I'm moving into D.C.
[02:12:44.222 --> 02:12:46.883]  They let the homeless camp everywhere, but oh watch, they'll say no.
[02:12:47.083 --> 02:12:49.184]  I'm moving in to the Lincoln Memorial.
[02:12:49.704 --> 02:12:50.324]  I'm moving in there.
[02:12:50.344 --> 02:12:51.505]  I'm going to live in D.C.
[02:12:52.825 --> 02:12:54.746]  This isn't about Trump anymore.
[02:12:55.286 --> 02:13:00.748]  This is about do we have America at least for another 50, 100 years or does it all go away?
[02:13:01.744 --> 02:13:05.387]  Oh, unless you made no mistake, we're being conquered right now.
[02:13:05.407 --> 02:13:06.668]  I mean, this is a takeover.
[02:13:07.869 --> 02:13:09.250]  Yep, I called last year.
[02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:11.211]  We talked about the apex of division.
[02:13:11.611 --> 02:13:15.974]  I called last year, December, and you said watch out for a foreign takeover.
[02:13:15.994 --> 02:13:17.536]  I felt it.
[02:13:17.816 --> 02:13:21.739]  I've had discernment for a long time, and you could just feel it.
[02:13:21.839 --> 02:13:22.779]  Everybody feels it.
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:29.084]  And we can't rely on the coward Republicans or any party anymore.
[02:13:29.821 --> 02:13:33.906]  It's time, Sons of Liberty style, we need to infiltrate and destroy.
[02:13:34.487 --> 02:13:40.435]  And we need to, like I said, if Joe Biden gets in, go to TakeOverDC.com.
[02:13:40.475 --> 02:13:41.677]  I'll have that up, ready to go.
[02:13:42.461 --> 02:13:45.882]  And like I said, supply lines, and just camp out D.C.
[02:13:45.922 --> 02:13:48.183]  however long it takes, and we'll take care of everybody.
[02:13:48.203 --> 02:13:57.126]  By the way, for those that don't know, there were bonus marchers a decade after World War I that had never been paid the bonus they were promised, which was only like a few hundred dollars.
[02:13:58.046 --> 02:14:04.549]  And they went and camped out, and then they got attacked at the Capitol, and it was something wrong that MacArthur was part of.
[02:14:04.849 --> 02:14:07.510]  They both got promoted, MacArthur and Eisenhower, because they were part of it.
[02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:10.471]  It was just black smudge on their record.
[02:14:11.747 --> 02:14:13.228]  There's a power in camping out.
[02:14:13.248 --> 02:14:17.231]  And we're not going to be camping out smoking methamphetamine and raping women like Antifa.
[02:14:17.612 --> 02:14:19.393]  We're going to go take over D.C.
[02:14:20.274 --> 02:14:22.395]  and encircle the White House and shut it down.
[02:14:23.596 --> 02:14:33.164]  And we're going to be non-violent because the power of the police cracking us on the heads is like what happened with Martin Luther King is what's going to destroy them.
[02:14:33.724 --> 02:14:38.008]  So we need to decry the violence up front because they're going to try to provocateur and blame it on us.
[02:14:41.998 --> 02:14:43.939]  That's absolutely how it's going to go.
[02:14:43.999 --> 02:14:45.460]  The same thing they did to Gandhi.
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:51.802]  And also, for the new listeners out there and people, I have a small business.
[02:14:51.842 --> 02:14:58.125]  For every 75, for every dollar I bring in, I'm spending 75 cents just to keep the business afloat.
[02:14:59.386 --> 02:15:00.546]  So they're destroying you.
[02:15:00.586 --> 02:15:02.407]  We're under attack and all you can do is fight back.
[02:15:02.427 --> 02:15:03.087]  God bless you, brother.
[02:15:03.608 --> 02:15:05.148]  Yeah, I mean, we're total commitment here.
[02:15:05.308 --> 02:15:07.729]  Listeners need to know I am 100% committed.
[02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:09.010]  I've never been more committed.
[02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.870]  I've never been stronger.
[02:15:11.671 --> 02:15:13.553]  My problem is that I've just got too much energy now.
[02:15:13.573 --> 02:15:14.654]  It's just like, whoa.
[02:15:14.754 --> 02:15:18.838]  It's like, just God's just like, the discernment, the energy just like, just keeps flowing.
[02:15:19.478 --> 02:15:20.679]  And I know you're feeling it as well.
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:21.981]  It's gonna get stronger, folks.
[02:15:22.001 --> 02:15:27.005]  As long as we step up on the field in faith, God will take us the rest of the way.
[02:15:28.426 --> 02:15:34.091]  And now the intel, the discernment is just like, now it's like, it's amazing.
[02:15:36.694 --> 02:15:37.635]  God hates cowards.
[02:15:39.096 --> 02:15:40.596]  And God wants to see you on the field.
[02:15:40.696 --> 02:15:41.477]  Get on the field.
[02:15:41.817 --> 02:15:43.637]  That's where you're going to find God.
[02:15:43.657 --> 02:15:44.317]  Weston, Iowa.
[02:15:44.337 --> 02:15:44.818]  Thanks for holding.
[02:15:44.838 --> 02:15:45.138]  Go ahead.
[02:15:46.478 --> 02:15:47.378]  Hey, Alex.
[02:15:47.458 --> 02:15:48.119]  Two things here.
[02:15:48.159 --> 02:15:52.400]  Number one, if you remember a movie that came out in 2006, Man of the Year, Robin Williams.
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:53.300]  They had an election.
[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:59.282]  The voting machines switched the election and switched the results to the candidate that was less desirable.
[02:15:59.342 --> 02:16:00.822]  Just like what's happening right now.
[02:16:01.982 --> 02:16:02.282]  That's right.
[02:16:02.302 --> 02:16:03.003]  That's a good movie.
[02:16:03.043 --> 02:16:04.043]  It's set in Latin America.
[02:16:05.834 --> 02:16:06.214]  Correct.
[02:16:06.494 --> 02:16:10.456]  Now the other thing is, is if Biden stays in... By the way, it's about Venezuela.
[02:16:10.616 --> 02:16:12.436]  It's about Smart... It's about Dominion.
[02:16:13.597 --> 02:16:13.977]  Correct.
[02:16:15.197 --> 02:16:15.657]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:16:17.078 --> 02:16:24.801]  If Biden stays in within six months, he's going to have a stroke or he's going to be declared incompetent, which is going to move Kamala Harris into the president's spot.
[02:16:25.141 --> 02:16:29.982]  And she's going to either put either AOC or Hillary Clinton in as her vice president.
[02:16:31.003 --> 02:16:34.684]  That would be the absolute worst scenario for this country if that would happen.
[02:16:37.819 --> 02:16:39.380]  Why is there such a cult of Hillary?
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.001]  Is it that she's such a devil worshipper?
[02:16:41.682 --> 02:16:44.384]  Like the demon that's able to inhabit her is like they worship her.
[02:16:44.484 --> 02:16:45.424]  The left worships her.
[02:16:46.585 --> 02:16:49.587]  It's something about her and that group.
[02:16:49.807 --> 02:16:50.688]  I know for a fact
[02:16:51.121 --> 02:16:54.523]  That everybody on Capitol Hill is somebody else's puppet, including the President.
[02:16:54.583 --> 02:16:58.446]  That's why they have such a problem with Trump, because he's nobody else's puppet.
[02:16:58.526 --> 02:16:59.247]  He's his own man.
[02:16:59.327 --> 02:17:03.149]  He can't be controlled by the special interests or anybody else in Washington, D.C.
[02:17:03.309 --> 02:17:03.910]  Well, no, exactly.
[02:17:03.930 --> 02:17:05.711]  It's not that even his decisions are all that good.
[02:17:05.731 --> 02:17:08.273]  A lot of more, it's that he is the President.
[02:17:10.735 --> 02:17:12.337]  That's exactly what it comes down to.
[02:17:12.798 --> 02:17:14.100]  He wants to stop this cold.
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:18.406]  He needs to enact the Insurrection Act, and he needs to enact the 28th Amendment.
[02:17:18.746 --> 02:17:26.197]  That way, if Biden does get in, anything Biden passes, anything under Biden, anybody in our Congress, representatives, whatever,
[02:17:26.557 --> 02:17:28.878]  They have to follow the same thing they're passing on us.
[02:17:29.358 --> 02:17:30.038]  They passed a bill.
[02:17:30.078 --> 02:17:30.978]  You can't have firearms?
[02:17:30.998 --> 02:17:31.639]  Well, guess what?
[02:17:31.739 --> 02:17:36.040]  Neither can they have firearms because the 28th Amendment will hold them accountable.
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:36.380]  That's right.
[02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:37.260]  We're not slaves.
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:39.281]  They can't do something to us that they don't follow.
[02:17:39.381 --> 02:17:39.861]  Exactly.
[02:17:39.881 --> 02:17:41.182]  Alright, thank you so much.
[02:17:42.142 --> 02:17:43.703]  I want to go to John, Dan, James.
[02:17:43.763 --> 02:17:45.104]  I didn't get to the Kraken speech.
[02:17:45.924 --> 02:17:46.604]  I need to air it.
[02:17:46.804 --> 02:17:47.785]  And I love Rob Portman.
[02:17:47.825 --> 02:17:49.286]  He loves, he knows he gets scripted sometimes.
[02:17:49.486 --> 02:17:50.546]  He'll get the last two segments.
[02:17:50.686 --> 02:17:54.028]  I got to air the Sidney Powell thing.
[02:17:54.048 --> 02:17:55.569]  At least part of the next segment.
[02:17:56.249 --> 02:17:57.210]  Briefly, we won't be here.
[02:17:58.117 --> 02:17:59.177]  Promo code Patriot.
[02:17:59.197 --> 02:18:00.158]  Additional 10% off.
[02:18:00.218 --> 02:18:01.038]  It ends Monday.
[02:18:01.338 --> 02:18:02.678]  We have a bunch of big sales.
[02:18:02.698 --> 02:18:03.939]  30-60% off and free shipping.
[02:18:04.319 --> 02:18:05.719]  And they have the promo code Patriot.
[02:18:06.779 --> 02:18:08.620]  And we're just sales all the time.
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:10.240]  We're just selling out what we get as it comes in.
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:12.321]  And hopefully more product comes back in.
[02:18:12.381 --> 02:18:17.802]  But it's the last day at preparewithalex.com to get 10% off all the different storable food packages that are there.
[02:18:18.222 --> 02:18:20.543]  Unprecedented preparewithalex.com.

[02:18:24.264 --> 02:18:27.447]  Additional 10% off on everything when you do that at checkout.
[02:18:27.568 --> 02:18:28.749]  Okay, John in New York.
[02:18:29.149 --> 02:18:31.171]  Yeah, what do we do if Biden takes office?
[02:18:31.832 --> 02:18:33.013]  I think we were just talking about it.
[02:18:33.334 --> 02:18:34.475]  We encircle the White House.
[02:18:35.336 --> 02:18:36.637]  We do real national strikes.
[02:18:37.758 --> 02:18:41.002]  We, you know, point out he's a communist Chinese agent.
[02:18:41.022 --> 02:18:42.023]  What do you think we should do?
[02:18:42.984 --> 02:18:46.367]  Well, Alex, it's a real honor to talk to you, let me say that first.
[02:18:46.587 --> 02:18:57.376]  And I'm wondering what we're going to do if this POS Joe Biden actually ends up in office, and then we end up with this cackling witch, Kamala Harris, as our president in the future.
[02:18:58.477 --> 02:19:03.400]  I think this country is in for a rude awakening, and a lot of people have their head in the sand.
[02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:04.901]  I deal with a lot of different people.
[02:19:04.961 --> 02:19:18.190]  I try to wake as many people up as possible, but there are a lot of people who just think this, like you said, is going to go away, or it's a passing thing, or it's some sort of joke, and they're just taking it, and I'm wondering if we're going to have to physically remove Joe Biden
[02:19:18.891 --> 02:19:22.373]  Through possible force out of the White House.
[02:19:22.513 --> 02:19:25.235]  They're the ones saying they're going to remove Trump.
[02:19:25.556 --> 02:19:29.538]  They were the ones that said that they would not accept the election and then they made it up that he won.
[02:19:29.798 --> 02:19:30.899]  Yeah, it's all fraud.
[02:19:30.939 --> 02:19:39.865]  It's all a gaslighting scam by the mainstream media that's irrelevant now, trying to be relevant with a big giant lie so big to prove to the system they still matter.
[02:19:40.085 --> 02:19:40.826]  That's all this is.
[02:19:41.949 --> 02:19:44.671]  A conspiracy is not a conspiracy if it's the truth.
[02:19:44.831 --> 02:19:48.473]  And these people on the mainstream news, and I was forced to watch it for four months.
[02:19:48.533 --> 02:19:50.834]  I had no access to any other media.
[02:19:51.455 --> 02:19:52.395]  I couldn't even watch it.
[02:19:52.595 --> 02:19:54.716]  Every single word, every single show.
[02:19:54.897 --> 02:19:57.958]  Does Kamala Harris not know how disingenuous she is?
[02:19:57.978 --> 02:20:00.360]  I mean, she's as fake as Brian Stelter.
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.141]  Like, where do they get these people?
[02:20:03.061 --> 02:20:03.642]  It's scary.
[02:20:03.822 --> 02:20:04.442]  She's scary.
[02:20:04.462 --> 02:20:10.886]  To picture her in control of the United States of America is one of the scariest thoughts I could possibly think of.
[02:20:11.584 --> 02:20:13.245]  Oh, the devil's laughing right now, I mean.
[02:20:14.265 --> 02:20:21.388]  You know, but God helps those who help themselves, and people who think that Jesus is going to come down and help us and part the Red Sea are wrong.
[02:20:21.668 --> 02:20:30.052]  We are going to have to help ourselves, and you know, we are an armed nation, and it's in the Constitution that we can, at some point, take control.
[02:20:30.152 --> 02:20:32.433]  Also the Declaration of Independence, you're damn right, thank you.
[02:20:32.893 --> 02:20:35.555]  All right, look, Dan and James, I appreciate John Rattaport.
[02:20:35.595 --> 02:20:39.057]  He gets preempted sometimes, very rarely, but we'll have two powerful segments coming up.
[02:20:39.918 --> 02:20:46.162]  But I'm going to come back and jam your calls in one minute apiece, and I want to go to Sidney Powell's speech she just did in Georgia outside the Capitol.
[02:20:46.943 --> 02:20:47.843]  This is breaking.
[02:20:48.684 --> 02:20:49.424]  This is breaking.
[02:20:49.444 --> 02:20:52.506]  I will be on The War Room at the start at 3 p.m.
[02:20:52.526 --> 02:20:53.147]  with the latest.
[02:20:54.844 --> 02:21:04.334]  As the mayor of Austin told citizens to stay home and to close restaurants, he was vacationing in Mexico following daughter's wedding.
[02:21:05.014 --> 02:21:06.316]  And of course not wearing a mask.
[02:21:06.436 --> 02:21:08.878]  They all know it's a scam.
[02:21:08.938 --> 02:21:10.380]  They're globalist criminals.
[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:14.604]  And the mayor of Austin is a compromised, known criminal.
[02:21:15.885 --> 02:21:16.646]  And a degenerate.
[02:21:19.358 --> 02:21:23.582]  Austin Mayor Steve Adler hosted his daughter's wedding and vacation with a group of people in Mexico.
[02:21:24.102 --> 02:21:26.124]  Yeah, because it's all a hoax, bro!
[02:21:27.805 --> 02:21:31.668]  And you know it, and we know it, but oh, we all comply.
[02:21:31.969 --> 02:21:33.070]  Stop complying.
[02:21:33.390 --> 02:21:35.432]  Businesses, stop thinking you've got liability.
[02:21:35.852 --> 02:21:36.312]  Stop it.
[02:21:36.813 --> 02:21:41.677]  You're allowing lawyers to create liability for the cold or the flu, where it's your fault if anyone ever gets sick.
[02:21:42.017 --> 02:21:42.758]  It's a fraud!
[02:21:44.599 --> 02:21:46.441]  It's lawyers taking over society.
[02:21:47.915 --> 02:21:49.555]  Dan in Alabama, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[02:21:50.956 --> 02:21:53.316]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[02:21:53.336 --> 02:22:06.680]  I've been with you for about 18, 19 years and I honestly don't know when or how I found InfoWars, but about the same time I became a believer and I don't think there's any coincidence there in that.
[02:22:08.461 --> 02:22:12.942]  I just thank you so much for all that you've been doing over the years and
[02:22:14.249 --> 02:22:31.793]  I know we've got a little time left, but I just wanted to, so many of your callers touched on the exact same things that I wanted to touch upon, and I swear I think that we're kind of like, in some weird way, we all have some kind of similar wavelength or something, where we have the similar thoughts and beliefs.
[02:22:32.353 --> 02:22:34.794]  Yeah, we're tied into the reality, brother, and let me just say this.
[02:22:36.263 --> 02:22:41.069]  I drink some, I cuss some, I like women, you know, I love life.
[02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:43.592]  But the whole thing is, I'm not a Pharisee or a fake.
[02:22:43.712 --> 02:22:46.615]  I love God, I know I'm a sinner, I love Jesus, I want to be good.
[02:22:47.036 --> 02:22:49.639]  And people resonate with that and know God's real.
[02:22:49.679 --> 02:22:51.180]  We're facing good versus evil here.
[02:22:51.781 --> 02:22:55.503]  So it's not the fake little preacher telling you he's perfect when he's probably a pedophile.
[02:22:55.964 --> 02:23:06.730]  It's us being honest about who we are, and that's why people hear the show and find Christ, because they already knew it was there, but it wasn't through some fake church, which is the abode of demons in most cases.
[02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:09.072]  The devil knows to take over churches.
[02:23:09.412 --> 02:23:13.375]  Most churches, and I'm not kidding when I say this, are run by
[02:23:14.295 --> 02:23:16.256]  Globalist, leftist, and devil worshippers.
[02:23:16.756 --> 02:23:18.517]  The big churches are run by Satanists.
[02:23:18.977 --> 02:23:20.118]  That's what Satan does.
[02:23:20.218 --> 02:23:24.360]  Jesus talked about that when he talked about the Pharisees and the synagogue of Satan.
[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:24.740]  Go ahead.
[02:23:25.721 --> 02:23:31.484]  Well, first off, this is the first election my wife and I have ever voted in.
[02:23:31.784 --> 02:23:33.565]  It's kind of in our belief system.
[02:23:33.585 --> 02:23:34.625]  We were never going to vote.
[02:23:34.705 --> 02:23:35.646]  We didn't think it mattered.
[02:23:36.026 --> 02:23:42.249]  Regardless, because the evil hands control both sides, or the spiritual side controls both sides of the party.
[02:23:43.132 --> 02:23:44.153]  In some ways, that's true.
[02:23:44.213 --> 02:23:45.474]  I've kind of come around a little bit.
[02:23:45.494 --> 02:23:45.915]  Well, you're right.
[02:23:45.955 --> 02:23:46.956]  Most of the time, that's true.
[02:23:47.036 --> 02:23:48.537]  But with Trump and all this, exactly.
[02:23:48.557 --> 02:23:49.158]  It was different.
[02:23:49.879 --> 02:23:52.061]  And now there was such a landslide, that's why they stole it from you.
[02:23:53.038 --> 02:24:05.003]  Yeah, and there was a caller a couple calls ago that touched on something, and he said something like, we're either at the turning point where we're at the end or we're at the start of a revolution.
[02:24:05.103 --> 02:24:07.224]  I think he's right in both instances.
[02:24:07.244 --> 02:24:09.064]  No, I agree.
[02:24:09.084 --> 02:24:11.585]  I mean, it's the end of a chapter, the beginning of the Revolutionary War.
[02:24:11.605 --> 02:24:12.206]  And let me say this.
[02:24:12.706 --> 02:24:22.510]  I forget who said it, so I'm not trying to plagiarize like Joe Biden does, but when a game's rigged and when a war is overwhelming, giving up
[02:24:24.156 --> 02:24:24.778]  Is it smart?
[02:24:24.858 --> 02:24:25.499]  It's surrender.
[02:24:26.341 --> 02:24:31.071]  You win by exposing the fraud and engaging it and making them steal it in front of everybody.
[02:24:31.392 --> 02:24:32.194]  That's how you win.
[02:24:32.434 --> 02:24:34.138]  If you don't play and you give up, they win.
[02:24:34.158 --> 02:24:34.699]  Does that make sense?
[02:24:35.851 --> 02:24:36.731]  Oh, exactly.
[02:24:36.992 --> 02:24:46.136]  I mean, five years ago, I went and paid cash for a property and did all the bugging out stuff and prepared for this kind of scenario.
[02:24:46.636 --> 02:24:51.538]  And then I got so beat down and worn out by the naysayers saying, you're wrong, you're crazy, this is stupid.
[02:24:51.918 --> 02:24:55.320]  Meanwhile, yourself and other people stayed in the fight, and I got out of it for about a year.
[02:24:55.931 --> 02:25:01.356]  I just want to encourage people like yourself and others, stay in the fight because it makes all the difference in the world.
[02:25:01.496 --> 02:25:08.182]  It may seem like we're going to lose the battle in the end, but ultimately, like in the song of the Battle of the Hymn of the Republic,
[02:25:08.883 --> 02:25:09.844]  His truth is marching.
[02:25:09.884 --> 02:25:12.705]  It's going to continue regardless of whether we stay in the fire or not.
[02:25:13.186 --> 02:25:14.447]  The truth is going to win out, Dan.
[02:25:14.507 --> 02:25:15.787]  It may look like we're going to lose out.
[02:25:15.807 --> 02:25:16.448]  His truth is marching on.
[02:25:16.468 --> 02:25:17.088]  Beautiful, Dan.
[02:25:17.128 --> 02:25:19.650]  And all I can say is, realize the power you have.
[02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:23.372]  Every person you tell about Band.Video, and then tell them to share it.
[02:25:23.392 --> 02:25:24.793]  Say, the enemy doesn't want you to know this.
[02:25:25.113 --> 02:25:25.914]  It's all right there.
[02:25:26.014 --> 02:25:26.374]  Share it.
[02:25:26.414 --> 02:25:27.254]  Tell others to share it.
[02:25:27.615 --> 02:25:28.835]  It's that, don't just share it.
[02:25:28.875 --> 02:25:29.736]  Tell others to share it.
[02:25:30.136 --> 02:25:32.858]  And it's that power of humans and that chain reaction.
[02:25:33.598 --> 02:25:34.699]  And it's unstoppable.
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:35.680]  So,
[02:25:37.088 --> 02:25:51.215]  I've been really upset and frustrated and feeling like, and I prayed to God a lot about it, and God just said, look, be happy, know you've done the right thing, I'll handle the rest of it, and my spirit's really strong right now, and I feel victory in the air.
[02:25:51.975 --> 02:25:58.358]  No matter what happens with Trump, they have bit off more than they can chew, and it's gonna get rough, but it's the beginning of the end of the New World Order.
[02:25:58.678 --> 02:26:00.459]  James in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[02:26:01.758 --> 02:26:02.759]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:26:02.819 --> 02:26:03.620]  Christ is King.
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:07.603]  I like what Owen said the other day with the new full moon cycle.
[02:26:07.643 --> 02:26:08.664]  The energies are changing.
[02:26:08.784 --> 02:26:14.069]  The solstice is coming up on the 21st, so you got a lot of new cleansing going on with the energy.
[02:26:14.429 --> 02:26:15.430]  Gotta keep moving forward.
[02:26:15.891 --> 02:26:19.374]  I see Trump vs. the Deep State as a game of pickle and baseball.
[02:26:19.674 --> 02:26:25.660]  When you got a runner caught between two bases, and he's hesitating, he's hesitating, he's hesitating, and he's waiting to pull the trigger.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.162]  He's letting everyone expose themselves.
[02:26:28.726 --> 02:26:30.670]  He's letting the D-State expose themselves.
[02:26:30.730 --> 02:26:34.197]  The DOJ wants to investigate his partner, Flynn.
[02:26:34.217 --> 02:26:36.301]  He's going real deep right now.
[02:26:36.742 --> 02:26:38.526]  I see him doing something major.
[02:26:39.861 --> 02:26:43.203]  I mean, he'll probably wait until their fake inauguration of Biden.
[02:26:43.683 --> 02:26:44.363]  It ain't going to be in D.C.
[02:26:44.383 --> 02:26:46.484]  because we're going to shut that down.
[02:26:46.924 --> 02:26:49.505]  They're probably going to do it in California or New York City.
[02:26:49.565 --> 02:26:50.466]  It's going to be something.
[02:26:50.486 --> 02:26:54.307]  Listen, I need everybody out there to understand me because I'm a major target.
[02:26:54.368 --> 02:26:59.810]  I'm not trying to act fancy pants, but let me tell you, I'm putting my ass on the line, my skin of the game, OK?
[02:27:00.250 --> 02:27:04.452]  I'm on there on the 12th, on people there, and I'm going to be there on the 20th come hell or high water.
[02:27:04.972 --> 02:27:08.414]  So you got my commitment, and they told me, don't you show your ass back in D.C.
[02:27:08.434 --> 02:27:09.135]  Well, I'm coming.
[02:27:09.655 --> 02:27:11.216]  And so you go ahead and do whatever you want.
[02:27:11.256 --> 02:27:12.197]  Maybe that's what God wants.
[02:27:12.917 --> 02:27:15.499]  If you strike me down, I'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:21.202]  And so I'm committed, I feel good, and I just appreciate you guys keeping me in the fight, James.
[02:27:22.923 --> 02:27:23.904]  Thank you very much.
[02:27:24.024 --> 02:27:25.305]  I do everything to support.
[02:27:25.325 --> 02:27:28.787]  I did all my Christmas shopping at infowarestartstore.com.
[02:27:29.067 --> 02:27:29.907]  Locked everything up.
[02:27:29.987 --> 02:27:30.668]  It's all on the way.
[02:27:31.226 --> 02:27:31.826]  We ready to go.
[02:27:31.846 --> 02:27:34.908]  Like you said, 79 days of hell.
[02:27:35.328 --> 02:27:38.069]  Wait until January comes around and they want to do all that.
[02:27:38.229 --> 02:27:39.990]  These are big dates coming up here.
[02:27:40.010 --> 02:27:43.192]  December 12th with the Electoral College.
[02:27:43.392 --> 02:27:44.453]  All of that matters.
[02:27:44.573 --> 02:27:46.193]  It all matters right now.
[02:27:46.634 --> 02:27:48.735]  We're head shaking them.
[02:27:48.755 --> 02:27:49.955]  They're exposing themselves.
[02:27:50.876 --> 02:27:52.056]  The line keeps going.
[02:27:52.517 --> 02:27:53.217]  It's going down.
[02:27:53.757 --> 02:27:54.277]  Absolutely.
[02:27:54.317 --> 02:27:54.898]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:27:55.238 --> 02:27:56.178]  I'm not suicidal.
[02:27:56.258 --> 02:27:57.659]  I want to live to be 120 years old.
[02:27:57.679 --> 02:27:59.100]  I want to see my great-grandchildren.
[02:28:00.290 --> 02:28:06.752]  But I've never been afraid to die, and I've never been afraid of the globalists, but at the same time, I'm not looking to get killed.
[02:28:07.872 --> 02:28:15.694]  But now, they could be leading me up to a guillotine to refuse Christ, and I would be happy knowing I'll be in Christ's presence within seconds.
[02:28:16.094 --> 02:28:20.995]  I mean, I've literally reached the point now where I don't want to die, but if it's God's plan, they kill me.
[02:28:21.015 --> 02:28:25.476]  I am committed into God's hands.
[02:28:26.701 --> 02:28:27.061]  Totally.
[02:28:27.582 --> 02:28:30.504]  I mean, I have literally prayed that prayer a thousand times.
[02:28:30.544 --> 02:28:31.725]  I commit myself into your hands.
[02:28:32.246 --> 02:28:32.946]  I commit myself.
[02:28:33.927 --> 02:28:36.989]  And I have begged God for the strength to carry this out.
[02:28:37.149 --> 02:28:40.872]  And it's just, it's like, it's like the joke in Wayne's world.
[02:28:40.893 --> 02:28:41.593]  We're not worthy.
[02:28:41.613 --> 02:28:42.254]  We're not worthy.
[02:28:42.914 --> 02:28:45.556]  Now, man, it's like, I know you're feeling it too.
[02:28:45.596 --> 02:28:46.917]  It's just being poured out.
[02:28:46.977 --> 02:28:48.479]  It's like, oh my God.
[02:28:48.979 --> 02:28:52.600]  And then I'm just like, feel like this dirty maggot in God's presence.
[02:28:52.660 --> 02:28:53.601]  It's just so strong.
[02:28:53.621 --> 02:28:57.462]  And I'm like, oh my, I mean, the Satanists have no idea what they're missing out on.
[02:28:57.502 --> 02:28:58.982]  They are just pathetic.
[02:28:59.002 --> 02:29:00.903]  Cause I, I felt the satanic energy.
[02:29:00.923 --> 02:29:03.664]  I almost got turned to it, but that was all just God's plan.
[02:29:03.824 --> 02:29:05.104]  And it's just an amazing moment.
[02:29:05.364 --> 02:29:06.525]  I didn't get to the Lin Wood speech.
[02:29:07.565 --> 02:29:08.985]  We did the Lin Wood speech.
[02:29:09.045 --> 02:29:11.506]  I didn't get to the Sidney Powell speech.
[02:29:11.766 --> 02:29:13.647]  We'll have that on the War Room coming up 3 p.m.
[02:29:13.667 --> 02:29:14.007]  Central.
[02:29:14.327 --> 02:29:16.048]  And I'm going to be on there too about this Austin mayor.
[02:29:16.308 --> 02:29:16.728]  Stay with us.
[02:29:17.984 --> 02:29:21.145]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[02:29:21.445 --> 02:29:22.245]  Don't let them win.
[02:29:22.625 --> 02:29:27.407]  Go to our emergency election newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:29:27.667 --> 02:29:31.228]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[02:29:31.568 --> 02:29:33.868]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:29:34.068 --> 02:29:36.529]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[02:29:37.049 --> 02:29:37.969]  Greetings, folks.
[02:29:39.130 --> 02:29:40.570]  Back for a weekly chat.
[02:29:42.151 --> 02:29:46.712]  You know, I've uncovered a press release from October 28th.
[02:29:48.157 --> 02:29:50.819]  It's now more relevant than ever.
[02:29:51.539 --> 02:29:52.420]  Pretty startling.
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:54.422]  In fact, very startling.
[02:29:55.522 --> 02:30:02.047]  It's from the Amistad Project at the Thomas More Society.
[02:30:02.527 --> 02:30:05.470]  Thomas More Society is a public interest law firm.
[02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:07.411]  These are serious people.
[02:30:08.932 --> 02:30:11.914]  They defend cases that other lawyers walk away from.
[02:30:13.015 --> 02:30:17.198]  Serious cases about religious liberty, for example, that's being trampled on.
[02:30:18.393 --> 02:30:21.715]  You can see what they're doing if you want to read up on it.
[02:30:22.735 --> 02:30:32.159]  But they released, before the election, on October 28th, through PR Newswire, and here's the headline.
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:34.360]  Amistad Project.
[02:30:35.521 --> 02:30:47.246]  Time to fully unmask Mark Zuckerberg's $350 million dollars funneled for election administration
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:50.321]  And the motivation behind it.
[02:30:53.343 --> 02:31:11.955]  I mean, $350 million is what they're charging Amistad Project is saying that Mark Zuckerberg funneled to the administration of elections in November in America.
[02:31:12.915 --> 02:31:17.278]  I mean, what does that even, how do you even compute that?
[02:31:18.783 --> 02:31:21.044]  Election is supposed to be run by public officials.
[02:31:26.248 --> 02:31:36.013]  Here's a private donor who is pretty much matching federal funds, state funds for elections.
[02:31:36.794 --> 02:31:38.115]  Where is this money going?
[02:31:38.975 --> 02:31:46.780]  Well, it went to, according to the Amistad Project, and I'm just getting this here,
[02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:53.962]  Most of it went to the Center for Tech and Civic Life.
[02:31:56.123 --> 02:31:56.783]  Ever hear of them?
[02:31:57.323 --> 02:31:58.104]  I certainly haven't.
[02:31:59.604 --> 02:32:00.625]  What does that even mean?
[02:32:01.505 --> 02:32:06.447]  According to what I've read about them, they have a very small budget.
[02:32:06.627 --> 02:32:15.230]  It's a non-profit 501c3, which would mean that they are a conduit for all of this money to distribute it
[02:32:16.132 --> 02:32:36.771]  To administer the elections in big cities like Philadelphia, for example, just to say where polling places would be, drop boxes for votes, pay poll workers, election officials.
[02:32:37.912 --> 02:32:42.536]  I mean, you know, there's a lot of explaining to do when somebody says to you,
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:54.648]  You donated $350 million to the election, and we want to know exactly where it went, and who it was designated for, and why.
[02:32:56.809 --> 02:33:03.614]  And why you ran most of it through this little non-profit, left-leaning non-profit.
[02:33:07.216 --> 02:33:08.917]  I mean, is anybody talking about this?
[02:33:08.937 --> 02:33:13.020]  Is anybody raising high holy hell about this?
[02:33:14.366 --> 02:33:27.449]  That we have a situation where the founder of Facebook, one of the biggest censors in the world now, or you can say this, but you can't say that.
[02:33:27.790 --> 02:33:31.771]  You can post this, it's very cute, but you can't post anything about this.
[02:33:32.651 --> 02:33:34.991]  That this censorship is what?
[02:33:35.432 --> 02:33:40.653]  Just one half of a squeeze play, a pincer movement that involves also
[02:33:41.673 --> 02:33:52.880]  Funding the presidential election of the United States in November just passed in order to achieve a victory for Joe Biden?
[02:33:54.901 --> 02:34:01.265]  I mean, this guy, Zuckerberg, recently testified before Congress.
[02:34:03.127 --> 02:34:04.147]  He and Jack Dorsey.
[02:34:05.468 --> 02:34:07.089]  Did anybody ask him about $350 million?
[02:34:09.198 --> 02:34:13.680]  The Amistad Project was making a lot of noise about this at the end of October.
[02:34:14.781 --> 02:34:16.081]  Did nobody pick up on it?
[02:34:16.442 --> 02:34:18.223]  Is nobody picking up on it now?
[02:34:20.664 --> 02:34:22.004]  What about the FBI?
[02:34:22.525 --> 02:34:24.025]  What about the Justice Department?
[02:34:25.186 --> 02:34:28.168]  I mean, this drives me completely crazy.
[02:34:29.728 --> 02:34:33.690]  What is the Attorney General of the United States actually doing here?
[02:34:35.211 --> 02:34:38.973]  Is he interested in Mark Zuckerberg funneling
[02:34:40.174 --> 02:34:44.216]  350 million dollars into the presidential election?
[02:34:44.656 --> 02:34:51.058]  Does that satisfy the requirement of enough evidence to turn around the election?
[02:34:51.078 --> 02:34:52.939]  Remember he made this statement a few days ago?
[02:34:53.579 --> 02:34:55.780]  Well, this is William Barr.
[02:34:55.900 --> 02:35:00.701]  I don't see enough evidence here that would overturn the election.
[02:35:04.003 --> 02:35:07.724]  This is the number one law enforcement officer in America?
[02:35:09.881 --> 02:35:36.052]  Sending a signal to lawyers and judges and prospective juries all over the United States when we have all these court cases that have been filed, revealing fraud, one whistleblower after another on sworn statement, pain of perjury, is testifying to having seen massive fraud.
[02:35:36.795 --> 02:35:38.196]  In all the battleground states?
[02:35:38.676 --> 02:35:48.984]  And this guy, the Attorney General, is sending a signal out to the nation that he doesn't see enough fraud to qualify as being able to overturn the election?
[02:35:51.106 --> 02:35:51.466]  Really?
[02:35:53.628 --> 02:35:58.572]  And this is just one thread of it here that I'm mentioning, but it's a whopper.
[02:36:00.393 --> 02:36:03.836]  Amistad Project, Zuckerberg, $350 billion?
[02:36:06.195 --> 02:36:08.036]  Funneled into the election?
[02:36:10.597 --> 02:36:10.917]  What?
[02:36:12.497 --> 02:36:12.918]  How?
[02:36:15.699 --> 02:36:18.260]  And nobody's calling this guy on the carpet?
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:33.485]  Nobody's issuing a subpoena that he has to swear on pain of perjury and worse, to present himself to the Justice Department for interrogation?
[02:36:35.006 --> 02:36:35.286]  Again,
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:38.561]  Elections are supposed to be public.
[02:36:39.221 --> 02:36:48.304]  You're not supposed to be able to step in and say, well, I'm just going to write a check here for $350 million to fund the election.
[02:36:48.364 --> 02:36:50.365]  Do you get what I'm saying, people here?
[02:36:50.745 --> 02:36:52.606]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[02:36:53.846 --> 02:36:54.306]  Please.
[02:36:54.906 --> 02:36:55.447]  I hope so.
[02:37:02.689 --> 02:37:05.350]  Yes, we're at the end of a chapter and the beginning of a new chapter.
[02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:11.282]  Regardless of who is installed as the next president here.
[02:37:14.083 --> 02:37:16.504]  Don't even begin to imagine that this is over.
[02:37:18.365 --> 02:37:34.373]  In fact, the worse it gets, in a sense, I'm talking now about the media, disgusting, repulsive lies, and agencies of the federal government lying and lying and crooked judges and all of this.
[02:37:35.262 --> 02:37:38.284]  Rejecting obvious evidence of election fraud.
[02:37:39.345 --> 02:37:43.008]  I mean, if you go to revolver.com, sorry for mentioning other websites.
[02:37:43.068 --> 02:37:48.571]  If you go to my website, occasionally you'll see me writing stories about this and no more fake news.
[02:37:49.232 --> 02:37:54.656]  If you go to American Thinker, if you go to Infowars, absolutely.
[02:37:55.336 --> 02:38:03.702]  You will see a running tally of article after article, exposure after exposure of election fraud.
[02:38:04.242 --> 02:38:04.963]  Statistical.
[02:38:05.874 --> 02:38:06.614]  Electronic.
[02:38:08.055 --> 02:38:09.036]  Ballot counting.
[02:38:10.137 --> 02:38:11.037]  Fake ballots.
[02:38:12.118 --> 02:38:18.262]  I mean, the whole nine yards of it all laid out day after day after day after day.
[02:38:20.063 --> 02:38:23.385]  And yet people are saying, well, where's the evidence for the fraud?
[02:38:23.505 --> 02:38:25.286]  I don't see the evidence.
[02:38:25.886 --> 02:38:27.087]  Well, what do you want?
[02:38:27.927 --> 02:38:30.349]  Something shoved down your throat?
[02:38:31.141 --> 02:38:36.044]  That you choke on and that would convince you that there's evidence of fraud here?
[02:38:39.147 --> 02:38:39.967]  It's a mountain.
[02:38:40.087 --> 02:38:53.297]  It's a Mount Everest of multi-dimensional fraud across the country in the election with no doubt whatsoever.
[02:38:53.777 --> 02:38:54.738]  Get used to it.
[02:38:54.918 --> 02:38:57.740]  Face up to it now.
[02:38:58.951 --> 02:39:01.913]  Okay, in this last segment, I want to talk a little science here.
[02:39:03.154 --> 02:39:04.835]  Actual science, not fake science.
[02:39:06.377 --> 02:39:12.281]  Because as you're seeing, we're into a new wave of lockdowns here, as predicted.
[02:39:14.663 --> 02:39:22.308]  In 1987, I started warning people that the medical cartel was the most dangerous cartel in the world long term.
[02:39:23.569 --> 02:39:27.192]  Because it pretends to neutrality,
[02:39:27.856 --> 02:39:30.317]  It says we don't fly any political banners.
[02:39:31.358 --> 02:39:32.438]  We're not partisan.
[02:39:32.478 --> 02:39:34.659]  We don't favor one group over another.
[02:39:35.079 --> 02:39:39.821]  We're just here to help to heal and to give service to humanity.
[02:39:40.982 --> 02:39:44.843]  And so this flies with a lot of people.
[02:39:46.044 --> 02:39:53.547]  More and more people over time begin to tune into this and to consider that this is true.
[02:39:54.388 --> 02:39:57.389]  When at the highest levels, nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:39:58.024 --> 02:39:59.585]  Highest levels of cartel.
[02:40:01.607 --> 02:40:03.688]  But it's a great front.
[02:40:05.089 --> 02:40:06.070]  It's a great act.
[02:40:07.011 --> 02:40:08.012]  It's a great con.
[02:40:08.632 --> 02:40:09.553]  It's a great hustle.
[02:40:11.794 --> 02:40:12.335]  And it works.
[02:40:13.035 --> 02:40:14.076]  And it's been working.
[02:40:14.837 --> 02:40:27.146]  And now you see how well it's working because you have whole populations bending under the will of the medical cartel, making pronouncements about the virus,
[02:40:27.942 --> 02:40:34.929]  And the test and the need for the lockdowns and the case numbers and so on.
[02:40:35.610 --> 02:40:42.177]  And I've exposed a great deal of that here at InfoWars and all of it at NoMoreFakeNews.
[02:40:46.181 --> 02:40:51.166]  The lockdowns are being based on the announcements of case numbers.
[02:40:52.094 --> 02:40:54.515]  Oh, we've got rising case numbers all over the country.
[02:40:55.035 --> 02:40:57.436]  You just tune into any newscast and that's what you get.
[02:40:57.576 --> 02:41:03.298]  Oh, reported today 3,000 new cases of COVID here and 6,000 there.
[02:41:03.318 --> 02:41:09.160]  And oh my God, you think, you know, everybody's keeling over and dying when obviously that's not the case.
[02:41:09.981 --> 02:41:11.861]  So what is actually going on?
[02:41:13.702 --> 02:41:17.384]  What is a case, a COVID-19 case?
[02:41:17.504 --> 02:41:18.344]  What does that mean?
[02:41:19.358 --> 02:41:25.140]  Well, it means that a person registers positive on a PCR test.
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:27.501]  That's the test for the virus.
[02:41:28.742 --> 02:41:29.942]  That's what it means.
[02:41:30.562 --> 02:41:35.644]  When that is ridiculous because traditionally a case means that somebody is sick.
[02:41:36.645 --> 02:41:37.505]  They have symptoms.
[02:41:37.585 --> 02:41:38.305]  You can see it.
[02:41:38.405 --> 02:41:39.446]  They don't feel well.
[02:41:42.887 --> 02:41:45.128]  Two fathers talking, well my son has a case of
[02:41:47.904 --> 02:41:49.025]  Oh, he's doing great.
[02:41:49.465 --> 02:41:52.468]  In fact, he ran a marathon yesterday and set a state record.
[02:41:53.149 --> 02:41:54.830]  Oh, you just said he has a case of the flu.
[02:41:55.130 --> 02:41:55.551]  He does.
[02:41:56.231 --> 02:41:57.733]  What do you mean he has a case of the flu?
[02:41:57.753 --> 02:42:02.957]  Well, I mean, he had a test and he tested positive for the flu virus.
[02:42:05.199 --> 02:42:06.060]  That ain't a case.
[02:42:06.881 --> 02:42:07.902]  That's not a case.
[02:42:09.263 --> 02:42:14.988]  Now, I've gone into great detail on why the test itself is a fraud, but that gives you the first clue.
[02:42:16.443 --> 02:42:18.745]  Just on the surface, you can see that.
[02:42:20.587 --> 02:42:28.734]  It's not a case, oh he tested positive for the virus, that's a COVID-19 case, and according to official stats, it is.
[02:42:29.475 --> 02:42:31.217]  But it's not a case of anything.
[02:42:32.198 --> 02:42:42.207]  Overwhelmingly, gigantically, people who test positive on that test are completely healthy and they're not going to get sick.
[02:42:43.649 --> 02:42:55.036]  The only reason they're being called COVID-19 cases is to pad the statistics to justify the lockdowns.
[02:42:56.697 --> 02:42:58.098]  Please understand that.
[02:42:58.939 --> 02:43:00.860]  And please pass that along.
[02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:11.407]  Because if enough people wake up to this gigantic fraud, more and more people will step out of their houses and resist and rebel.
[02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:24.838]  And find out every which way under the sun to reopen the economy and make it stay open regardless of what happens in Washington or in Governor's mansions.
[02:43:28.660 --> 02:43:36.485]  Now the test spits out false positives like a rigged slot machine as I've made clear several times.
[02:43:38.266 --> 02:43:41.588]  It's run in cycles which are
[02:43:42.836 --> 02:43:54.045]  Quantum leaps, each cycle is a quantum leap, in magnifying the original tiny extract from the test sample taken from the swab.
[02:43:54.886 --> 02:43:56.567]  It's like blowing up a photograph.
[02:43:57.708 --> 02:44:03.733]  And each cycle is a gigantic blow up of the test specimen, the patient.
[02:44:04.774 --> 02:44:09.518]  Well, I published The Smoking Gun several weeks ago.
[02:44:10.316 --> 02:44:26.220]  A video in which Anthony Fauci said quite clearly that if you run this test at 35 cycles or more, it's completely useless and incompetent and means absolutely nothing.
[02:44:27.121 --> 02:44:28.701]  As in, nothing.
[02:44:28.721 --> 02:44:30.181]  Okay?
[02:44:31.402 --> 02:44:33.022]  What does that mean, 35 cycles?
[02:44:33.062 --> 02:44:39.664]  That would mean that you're blowing up the photograph or the tiny sample from the swab
[02:44:42.068 --> 02:44:49.352]  35 times to make a detection of is the virus there or not.
[02:44:52.453 --> 02:44:53.634]  That's what Fauci said.
[02:44:53.654 --> 02:44:58.597]  35 cycles or greater, it's completely useless.
[02:44:59.237 --> 02:45:07.402]  Well, I revealed in a CDC document on the FDA homepage
[02:45:08.348 --> 02:45:19.750]  That according to FDA guidelines, the test should be run at up to 40 cycles in order to decide whether the virus is actually there.
[02:45:20.951 --> 02:45:22.911]  That's a federal guideline.
[02:45:23.451 --> 02:45:37.434]  And so you can bet your bottom dollar that test labs in America, if not all over the world, are running this test at more than 35 cycles, which means it's completely useless.
[02:45:38.439 --> 02:45:43.542]  And meaningless for any purpose of diagnosis.
[02:45:46.643 --> 02:45:46.943]  Get it?
[02:45:48.604 --> 02:45:49.785]  And here's the capper.
[02:45:51.105 --> 02:45:58.069]  This was admitted in a New York Times article which I cited in my smoking gun piece at No More Fake News.
[02:46:03.772 --> 02:46:05.853]  The doctor and the patient
[02:46:07.944 --> 02:46:17.551]  Who's being tested are never notified by the lab that does the test as to how many cycles it's run at.
[02:46:18.892 --> 02:46:20.213]  Never notified.
[02:46:21.074 --> 02:46:29.540]  So neither the doctor nor the patient has any way of knowing whether the test was run at 20 cycles, 30, 35, 40, or even more.
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:29.800]  And yet,
[02:46:38.891 --> 02:46:53.823]  We hear nothing on the television news except, oh my God, the case numbers, oh my God, the case numbers, meaning, oh my God, the con job test is registering positive.
[02:46:56.085 --> 02:46:56.865]  That's all it means.
[02:46:57.766 --> 02:46:58.947]  Doesn't mean anything else.
[02:46:59.667 --> 02:47:01.209]  Never will mean anything else.
[02:47:02.129 --> 02:47:05.372]  And therefore, the lockdowns, all of them,
[02:47:05.674 --> 02:47:16.816]  The first wave lockdowns, the second wave lockdowns, the third wave lockdowns, which are all based on this fraudulent test, are themselves complete frauds.
[02:47:18.616 --> 02:47:20.777]  There was never a reason for lockdown.
[02:47:21.257 --> 02:47:23.477]  There was never a rationale for lockdown.
[02:47:23.937 --> 02:47:27.418]  It was always an attack on you and all of us.
[02:47:28.178 --> 02:47:30.538]  An economic devastation attack.
[02:47:30.578 --> 02:47:33.179]  It was always in-house arrests.
[02:47:33.699 --> 02:47:34.339]  It was always
[02:47:34.827 --> 02:47:36.268]  To destroy the economy.
[02:47:36.848 --> 02:47:39.790]  To put people out of work by the millions.
[02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:43.292]  To bankrupt small and medium-sized businesses.
[02:47:44.293 --> 02:47:49.736]  To destroy the whole reality and concept of free enterprise.
[02:47:50.777 --> 02:47:52.478]  And to put all of us under the gun.
[02:47:52.999 --> 02:47:55.420]  That was always the purpose of the lockdowns.
[02:47:56.281 --> 02:48:01.324]  And the virus, which has never been proved to exist,
[02:48:03.075 --> 02:48:19.985]  And the test for the virus, which is completely fraudulent test, are the cover stories floated and pushed and rammed at the public to justify
[02:48:20.583 --> 02:48:34.313]  The real covert operation, which is the lockdowns, the shutdowns, the economic destruction of economies by globalists who are fully intentional in taking us into their brave new world.
[02:48:34.933 --> 02:48:36.154]  That is the story.
[02:48:36.674 --> 02:48:39.276]  That is what has been going on since the beginning.
[02:48:43.779 --> 02:48:48.743]  Knowing it means resisting it, rebelling against it,
[02:48:49.517 --> 02:48:51.438]  Finding ways to say no.
[02:48:53.759 --> 02:48:55.699]  Supporting the truth.
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:48:58.661]  The truth at the core of this.
[02:49:00.581 --> 02:49:07.364]  And doing whatever it takes to maintain freedom in this country and in this world.
[02:49:08.444 --> 02:49:10.105]  That is the story.
[02:49:11.085 --> 02:49:12.806]  See you next time on InfoWars.

[02:50:19.681 --> 02:50:22.843]  It's been a year full of sales because the country's in an emergency.
[02:50:23.203 --> 02:50:24.443]  The economy's breaking down.

[02:51:08.077 --> 02:51:08.637]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:51:11.943 --> 02:51:16.924]  And the answer to the Great Reset is the Great Renaissance, or the Great Resistance.
[02:51:17.665 --> 02:51:25.447]  And that starts at InfoWars.com and Band.Video, where our views and support is exploding when it comes to actual visitors.
[02:51:25.827 --> 02:51:28.988]  But when it comes to financing our operation, money's actually gone down.
[02:51:29.608 --> 02:51:30.889]  I guess people think, well, Jones is right.
[02:51:30.909 --> 02:51:31.769]  He must have lots of support.
[02:51:31.809 --> 02:51:32.470]  No, that's not the case.
[02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:33.951]  We need financial support.

[02:51:53.704 --> 02:51:56.406]  Because the great resistance to tyranny is here.
[02:52:01.886 --> 02:52:04.548]  Look, all of my pitches to you are 100% straight up.
[02:52:04.848 --> 02:52:13.936]  I'm always a straight shooter, but with what's happening in the country in the last month of 2020, I'm just going to be completely honest.
[02:52:14.597 --> 02:52:16.358]  I need money to keep fighting the globalists.
[02:52:17.259 --> 02:52:20.401]  I need money to have this crew and to run this independent media operation.
[02:52:20.762 --> 02:52:21.542]  Let me explain something.
[02:52:23.324 --> 02:52:25.185]  Apple is a trillion dollar company.
[02:52:26.006 --> 02:52:27.187]  Google's like a $900 billion company.
[02:52:29.184 --> 02:52:36.396]  All those big tech companies have spent hundreds of billions of dollars to develop their own infrastructure.
[02:52:37.718 --> 02:52:41.063]  I'm very proud of my five-man IT team.
[02:52:42.321 --> 02:52:56.251]  That we have banned on video and our own video platform that reaches like 10 million people a day and we have our own streams, our own satellite uplinks for radio and TV, our own email servers, everything we have to do ourselves.
[02:52:56.331 --> 02:52:57.471]  I'm not a victim, I'm not bitching.
[02:52:58.052 --> 02:53:00.854]  I'm just simply saying, it took a lot.
[02:53:01.636 --> 02:53:08.438]  With them de-platforming us three years ago and all the Democrat lawsuits and all the attacks to stay on air to this moment.
[02:53:08.538 --> 02:53:10.558]  I spent basically almost everything I've got.
[02:53:10.578 --> 02:53:15.020]  I mortgaged my house because I knew it would come down to the wire right now.
[02:53:15.380 --> 02:53:19.081]  And now people can see how close it is, this race against good versus evil.
[02:53:20.785 --> 02:53:22.406]  First, I want to thank you for keeping us on the air.
[02:53:22.426 --> 02:53:23.446]  I want to salute you.
[02:53:23.466 --> 02:53:29.209]  I want to tell you, hey, you've done an amazing job, and we've done a pretty good job as well, not giving up.
[02:53:29.289 --> 02:53:33.832]  But I'm asking you right now to realize that we've come so far together.
[02:53:34.292 --> 02:53:36.253]  We don't want the globalists to win.
[02:53:36.813 --> 02:53:39.795]  So listen, I've got great products you need.
[02:53:40.675 --> 02:53:41.936]  Air filtration for your house.
[02:53:42.316 --> 02:53:44.297]  Highest quality four-stage ion filter.
[02:53:44.857 --> 02:53:46.338]  Way below any competition.
[02:53:46.698 --> 02:53:47.278]  Best deal.
[02:53:47.579 --> 02:53:48.619]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:53:48.959 --> 02:53:49.980]  The water filtration.
[02:53:50.925 --> 02:53:55.127]  Alexa Pure, highest rated, one of the top ones out there for the price you pay.
[02:53:55.307 --> 02:53:55.867]  You can't beat it.
[02:53:56.548 --> 02:54:05.032]  The supplements, the films, the books, the t-shirts, all of it is really high quality and it funds our operation.
[02:54:05.172 --> 02:54:06.192]  I want to stay in this fight.
[02:54:06.673 --> 02:54:07.613]  That's all I care about.
[02:54:07.633 --> 02:54:10.154]  I've been fighting so long, 27 years on air.
[02:54:10.534 --> 02:54:11.455]  You've kept me in the fight.
[02:54:11.475 --> 02:54:17.338]  We're in this together, but I'm telling you right now, as we close out 2020 and enter into this future,
[02:54:18.078 --> 02:54:21.925]  The globalists did not count on us being on air at this time.
[02:54:22.587 --> 02:54:25.392]  So the revolutionary act of you going to InfoWarsTore.com
[02:54:26.857 --> 02:54:37.983]  And getting fish oil, or getting Brain Force, or getting DNA Force Plus, or getting X2, or getting Vaso Beans, or getting Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, or Alpha Power.
[02:54:38.863 --> 02:54:44.126]  All of that gets you a great product, and then funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:54:44.566 --> 02:54:46.967]  Can you imagine the world without InfoWars?
[02:54:47.327 --> 02:54:50.689]  Can you imagine if we hadn't been on the air in the last 27 years?
[02:54:51.029 --> 02:54:54.391]  Can you imagine what would have happened if you, and countless others,
[02:54:55.287 --> 02:55:00.419]  Had it supported us, we would not be in a position right now to even be able to contend with the Globalists.
[02:55:00.819 --> 02:55:01.842]  We would have already been defeated.
[02:55:01.902 --> 02:55:02.984]  So, I'm going to tell you again.
[02:55:04.454 --> 02:55:05.955]  Now is the time for your word of mouth.
[02:55:06.255 --> 02:55:07.316]  Now is the time for your prayer.
[02:55:07.516 --> 02:55:15.861]  Now is your time to financially support InfoWars and get great products you need at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.

[02:55:36.614 --> 02:55:40.477]  But regardless, I'm doing this in front of God, so what matters is I carry out the task.
[02:55:41.037 --> 02:55:42.178]  Thank you for keeping me in the game.
[02:55:42.638 --> 02:55:43.458]  Thank you for your support.

[02:55:56.917 --> 02:56:02.059]  I told Vice Television four years ago that Trump was only one wave.
[02:56:02.559 --> 02:56:05.281]  That Trump was a manifestation of liberty and freedom.
[02:56:05.581 --> 02:56:06.421]  Look, I love Trump.
[02:56:06.801 --> 02:56:07.501]  I love myself.
[02:56:07.842 --> 02:56:09.722]  But people come and people go.
[02:56:09.922 --> 02:56:11.783]  This is about a mass awakening.
[02:56:11.883 --> 02:56:13.324]  This is about freedom.
[02:56:13.604 --> 02:56:15.185]  Here's a clip from Vice TV.
[02:56:15.345 --> 02:56:16.705]  Bigger waves are coming.
[02:56:17.446 --> 02:56:19.166]  We don't rise and fall with Trump.
[02:56:19.747 --> 02:56:21.947]  Now you're going to see the next wave.
[02:56:22.288 --> 02:56:22.928]  Good luck with that.
[02:56:24.011 --> 02:56:36.504]  So the world is so awake, populism is so explosive right now, that the globalists have printed the COVID exaggeration, trying to lock society down and bring in martial law, because they want to bankrupt society.
[02:56:37.104 --> 02:56:40.908]  If they're successful, we're going to have a long, hardcore depression.
[02:56:41.268 --> 02:56:46.534]  So, engage in a stopgap, engage in an insurance policy that you can eat.

[02:56:58.503 --> 02:56:59.784]  Hope you don't need to eat the food.
[02:57:00.004 --> 02:57:02.045]  But regardless, know you've got the food.

[02:57:33.799 --> 02:57:35.320]  We've come so far together, folks.
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:36.440]  I'm so exhausted.
[02:57:36.460 --> 02:57:38.140]  I'm not going to give you some slick ad.
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:39.901]  I'm just going to say we got great products.
[02:57:40.221 --> 02:57:41.001]  We support you.
[02:57:41.261 --> 02:57:42.601]  Support us in this damn fight.
[02:57:42.861 --> 02:57:44.922]  And get the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:45.282 --> 02:57:48.869]  Or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:57:49.029 --> 02:57:55.822]  But whatever you do, pray for freedom, pray for an awakening, and support the info war, and say, God damn you to hell, Bill Gates!
