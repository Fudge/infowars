[00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.012]  This has been one of the most powerful broadcasts we've ever done.
[00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:06.074]  Absolutely jam-packed.
[00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:08.616]  And I feel empty and pathetic.
[00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:13.840]  Because I feel like we should just do even better.
[00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:17.163]  Because we have such incredible tools.
[00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:26.090]  It is confirmed, Homeland Security, NIH, documents from the CDC, that COVID-19 is a hoax.
[00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:43.969]  That they are saying anybody with the flu, anybody with a cold has it, and that they're saying that we don't need a test to say somebody has COVID-19, and then if they say one person has it, starting with 15 and up to 36, we're gonna say that group has it.
[00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.274]  So if two people test positive, they're gonna say that's 70-something cases.
[00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.435]  We have the documents!
[00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:53.696]  We have the video!
[00:00:57.176 --> 00:01:05.279]  If I thought putting a blender on my desk and turning it on high and sticking my fingers in it and chopping them off would defeat the globalists, I would stick my hand in a blender right now.
[00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:06.599]  I'm not a sadomasochist.
[00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.379]  I don't like pain.
[00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.600]  I'm saying I want to beat these people.
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.882]  And there's nothing more frustrating than sitting here knowing we have them by the balls.
[00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:22.144]  I'm sitting here literally with the Death Star plans.
[00:01:23.164 --> 00:01:39.032]  of the collapse and depression and the destruction of society and the annihilation of the third world and Trump losing the election and all of it and we sit here and it's just like oh it's one more story you know don't promote info wars you might get banned.
[00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:44.836]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:49.923]  Mark your calendars.
[00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:51.826]  It is Tuesday, June 30th, 2020.
[00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.529]  125 days out from the election.
[00:01:56.071 --> 00:02:03.962]  And more than two weeks ago, we were contacted by a state health department individual saying you need to look at how they're counting
[00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:16.645]  Under federal directives, individuals that they say might have COVID, and they're using computer models, where they'll have a contact tracer talk to someone and say, well, you're at a bar of, what, 100 people?
[00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:18.507]  Well, we're just going to say half of them have it.
[00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:20.128]  And then that's put in the number.
[00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:30.215]  And I meant to research it, and then people started sending us links out of Texas with county commissioners and folks on Facebook saying, hey, here's why the numbers are up.
[00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:31.536]  We've been told
[00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:37.631]  That if someone has a sore throat or the sniffles and even comes up negative, we count them as COVID-19.
[00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:40.634]  And then anyone there around, we count as COVID-19.
[00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:51.965]  Well, then yesterday after the broadcast, I spent about five hours with Rob Dew, our news director, watching county commissioner meetings in some of the most populous counties in Texas, one up in Dallas.
[00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:56.029]  And they show the CDC documents.
[00:02:57.048 --> 00:03:02.331]  And the NIH directives, and we've confirmed that not just here, but in other states, this is what's been sent out.
[00:03:04.032 --> 00:03:10.296]  Now, some states like West Virginia are refusing to follow this directive, but Texas is.
[00:03:10.396 --> 00:03:14.718]  This is the end of this hoax, if you get the article out.
[00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:16.819]  It's at InfoWars.com in the video report.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.442]  Now, today's live show is titled, Two Global Exclusives Now Breaking.
[00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:25.164]  NIH CDC Caught Inflating COVID Numbers At Least 15 Times.
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.244]  Plus Roger Stone to break his silence on the eve of imprisonment and more.
[00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:36.552]  And in that same post, we have the article, not just the live feed, but the article in the video posted.
[00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:38.454]  Here is the article that has the video posted.
[00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:40.096]  Pandemic bombshell.
[00:03:40.497 --> 00:03:44.341]  CDC inflating COVID infection rates up to 16 times.
[00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:50.714]  And that's really, some of it actually says 20 to 30 times.
[00:03:51.154 --> 00:04:05.524]  We just say at least 16 times, but I wrote this this morning with the crew member very quickly, so let's just add the number at least 16 times, because they count the person that has it, and then they say on average 15 times.
[00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:06.445]  It's on video.
[00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:08.907]  We show you all the graphs.
[00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:10.508]  In fact, here are some of these documents.
[00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:11.829]  This is out of Collin County.
[00:04:12.964 --> 00:04:15.205]  This is from the CDC and NIH right here.
[00:04:15.225 --> 00:04:17.945]  Zoom in a little bit more for me guys, thank you.
[00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:27.668]  And the current case detection system before May 18th, this just came out yesterday, was only one person's counted as it.
[00:04:28.108 --> 00:04:37.570]  Now the new one is up to 36, but the average is 15 additional on top of the one, so 16 or 15 depending on how you look at it.
[00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.611]  New probable case,
[00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:45.308]  Detection and then they say on video in the documents they count that as a case.
[00:04:46.088 --> 00:04:56.430]  We have the new definition right here New probable case definition means a case Chris Hill the County Commissioner judge just says this is gonna be problematic.
[00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:06.212]  This is gonna create a hysteria and this is back on May 18th, so This is incredible you've got to investigate your counties and your cities this is going on everywhere and
[00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.420]  This is so important.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.123]  I cannot stress to all of you how important it is to get these articles out.
[00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:13.264]  Pandemic bombshell.
[00:05:13.764 --> 00:05:17.787]  CDC inflating COVID infection rates up to 16 times.
[00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.690]  And again, we've got to correct that.
[00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.773]  It's actually up to 36 times, but it's at least 16 times.
[00:05:27.475 --> 00:05:32.719]  The bottom projection is 15 for every person that has it.
[00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:33.900]  But then it gets worse.
[00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:35.925]  This is breathtaking.
[00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:38.106]  I'm actually having an anxiety attack.
[00:05:38.126 --> 00:05:39.887]  This is so huge and I never have anxiety attacks.
[00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:42.269]  I mean, I'm literally having an anxiety attack right now on air.
[00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:44.670]  This is so bombshell.
[00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.030]  This is so smoking gun.
[00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:52.554]  They say on the video and show the CDC directive that they don't need a positive test to say you have COVID-19.
[00:05:52.714 --> 00:05:55.115]  And then that's the basis for at least 15 more around you.
[00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:59.157]  It says sniffles, runny nose, sore throat, cough, any of those.
[00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:06.815]  And so he basically says anybody in Texas that has a sore throat, you don't have COVID-19, then that counts 15 more people.
[00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:10.296]  This is unbelievable fraud.
[00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:13.338]  And Joe Biden's running on this saying it's all Trump's fault.
[00:06:14.078 --> 00:06:15.479]  The EU shut U.S.
[00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:16.659]  citizens out of the EU.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.640]  Half of Americans are out of work.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.481]  That's the new headlines.
[00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:20.821]  Half.
[00:06:22.352 --> 00:06:22.592]  Of course.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.441]  It is Tuesday, June 30th.
[00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:43.141]  The year is 2020.
[00:06:43.221 --> 00:07:01.250]  We are 125 days out from the election and the Democrats are openly saying President Trump is to blame for the worst COVID cases on earth and rapid explosion of the number of cases, though the decline in deaths is now the public is on to how they're killing people by intubating them.
[00:07:02.318 --> 00:07:04.400]  But still, they're trying to create total hysteria.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:10.706]  The biggest news ever on COVID-19 has broken exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:10.946 --> 00:07:12.628]  Rob Deuce stayed up here until 2 a.m.
[00:07:12.668 --> 00:07:13.149]  last night.
[00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.891]  I stayed up here until 9 o'clock last night working on this.
[00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:16.752]  It was so important.
[00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:18.213]  And what's shocking is...
[00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:28.240]  It turns out, health departments are calling us, people are calling us, the emails are flooding in, going, we've been telling you this for weeks, but no major news has picked this up.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:41.988]  And it's true, over two weeks ago, state health department official contacted me and said, Alex, they're counting all of the people, this is just amazing, that are around someone that has COVID as having COVID.
[00:07:42.308 --> 00:07:43.889]  Look into it, and I just dropped the ball.
[00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:53.615]  Well now we have the documents, now we have the County Commissioner meetings, and now we've confirmed it's all over the country where the NIH and CDC can turn up the cases or turn them down.
[00:07:53.995 --> 00:07:54.836]  Totally criminal!
[00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:57.898]  You think it's bad to say people that died of gunshot wounds died of COVID?
[00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:03.621]  You think it's bad to send old people at nursing homes to their deaths by sending real patients in there?
[00:08:04.482 --> 00:08:05.703]  This is even bigger!
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.682]  Fauci and all of them are orchestrating it.
[00:08:08.742 --> 00:08:09.803]  He needs to go to prison.
[00:08:10.043 --> 00:08:17.489]  By the way, he's been caught, after he does the hearings, pulling the mask off when he's getting in his car or when he's leaving or when he's in the meeting rooms.
[00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:18.550]  It's all a hoax.
[00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.452]  Democrats in Nevada have been caught doing it as well.
[00:08:22.413 --> 00:08:25.055]  So, these people are savage criminals.
[00:08:25.676 --> 00:08:27.197]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:08:27.217 --> 00:08:29.159]  This is Bill Gates running this whole thing with the U.N.
[00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:29.779]  against America.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.362]  So, it's a 14-minute report.
[00:08:32.382 --> 00:08:35.664]  We'll have time to air half of it now for your own future.
[00:08:36.445 --> 00:08:37.686]  Go to BAN.VIDEO.
[00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:39.927]  We had to launch our own system to be able to give you this information.
[00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:42.388]  And get the video that broke at 2 a.m.
[00:08:42.408 --> 00:08:49.652]  last night when Dude posted it, breaking state's order to fraudulently inflate COVID-19 cases 15 times actual rate.
[00:08:50.732 --> 00:08:51.913]  That is conservative, by the way.
[00:08:52.273 --> 00:08:54.554]  This is kryptonite to the New World Order.
[00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:54.975]  Get it.
[00:08:56.175 --> 00:08:58.576]  Share it by hand, by email, by text.
[00:08:59.137 --> 00:09:05.280]  Print out copies of it with a URL at BAN.VIDEO or InfoWars.com and just get it out there everywhere.
[00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:15.691]  This morning I was at a red light and people started screaming and I looked over, rolled my window down, and a man was flipping me off, saying, F you, put your mask on.
[00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:19.675]  Joy Behard says she stalks people in New York not wearing masks.
[00:09:20.015 --> 00:09:22.618]  We have video police beating the hell out of people not wearing them.
[00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.199]  A black man, white cops.
[00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:25.300]  Oh, but that's okay.
[00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:28.283]  This is a cult, folks, making their move.
[00:09:28.323 --> 00:09:30.465]  So, here is the first half of the report.
[00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:34.897]  And if you choose this mission and choose to accept it, this will devastate the enemy.
[00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:37.239]  It's got 80,000 views since 2 a.m.
[00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:37.639]  this morning.
[00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:38.400]  Okay, great.
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.341]  It needs 5 million views.
[00:09:40.962 --> 00:09:43.724]  Our top video on Bandot Video only has 3 million.
[00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:47.067]  I want 5 million by tomorrow.
[00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:49.049]  We can break their back!
[00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.653]  We can expose these murdering criminals and the Great Depression they're already triggered!
[00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:56.333]  This is a war, an info war!
[00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:58.234]  Get the video breaking.
[00:09:58.534 --> 00:10:02.934]  States ordered to fraudulently inflate COVID numbers at least 15 times.
[00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:04.795]  Here is the report.
[00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:18.637]  State of Texas, DSHS has informed public health departments that they are, they have adopted a revised definition for COVID-19 probable cases.
[00:10:19.397 --> 00:10:22.838]  So for confirmed case, it stays the same.
[00:10:22.858 --> 00:10:23.838]  You still just need PCR.
[00:10:24.653 --> 00:10:27.034]  But now they've added a probable case definition.
[00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:30.776]  So that still gets counted towards the case count.
[00:10:31.576 --> 00:10:35.017]  It's different, it's not confirmed, it's probable, but it's still a case.
[00:10:35.498 --> 00:10:41.820]  So at the end of this definition, there are 15 different options on how you could be classified as a probable case.
[00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:47.603]  Based on this diagram and what they report, there's a total of 17 cases now.
[00:10:48.403 --> 00:10:52.525]  One is still only confirmed because that was that original index case,
[00:10:53.148 --> 00:11:01.411]  Who then had all these contacts underneath in orange and all the rest of them became probable, but they are still considered a case.
[00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:12.495]  It has the potential to be a very significant event for us here in Texas and here in Collin County as the state now has elected to adopt this new probable definition.
[00:11:12.795 --> 00:11:21.078]  If you have a subjective fever and you have a headache and you live in Collin County, you now meet the qualifications to be a probable COVID patient.
[00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:24.641]  It is remarkable how low the standard is now.
[00:11:25.841 --> 00:11:37.949]  If you have one of the major symptoms, you have a cough or you have shortness of breath and you live in Collin County, then you can satisfy the definition for a probable COVID case.
[00:11:38.869 --> 00:11:49.476]  But I'm very concerned that we absolutely could see the numbers jump very rapidly in a way that actually is not indicative of what we're seeing here in the community in the public health department.
[00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:55.812]  The clips you just saw took place on May 18th of this year, just a few weeks ago.
[00:11:56.813 --> 00:12:03.836]  Now, we were contacted by a whistleblower inside the state health department at a high level a few weeks ago about the big changes that were coming.
[00:12:04.916 --> 00:12:13.840]  Separately, another whistleblower contacted us with the video you just saw and more we're about to play, but this is complete proof
[00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:23.531]  That the COVID-19 testing regime and the definitions they semantically use from the NIH and CDC are frauds.
[00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:25.735]  This has been confirmed.
[00:12:25.815 --> 00:12:33.098]  If one person tests positive for COVID-19, 15 people in the computer model are then said to have it.
[00:12:33.338 --> 00:12:39.841]  So possibles are now defined as of the middle of May as COVID cases.
[00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:40.942]  But it gets worse.
[00:12:41.342 --> 00:12:46.584]  They go on to say that they're going to say it's COVID-19 even if someone's not been tested.
[00:12:46.904 --> 00:12:49.946]  And if someone dies without tests, they're going to say it's COVID-19.
[00:12:50.586 --> 00:12:56.792]  And let's say the virus calls you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem.
[00:12:57.453 --> 00:13:04.600]  Some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death.
[00:13:06.441 --> 00:13:26.993]  Right now we're still recording it and we'll, I mean the great thing about having forms that come in and a form that has the ability to mark it as COVID-19 infection, the intent is right now that those, if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.
[00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:29.675]  But this is bigger than that.
[00:13:30.155 --> 00:13:34.478]  This is the NIH directing the states
[00:13:35.953 --> 00:13:43.418]  To say that if one person tests positive in a questionable test, that 15 others are positive as well.
[00:13:43.438 --> 00:13:44.920]  So we're going to go through these clips.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:50.904]  We're going to link to where you can see hours of this at the end of the video for yourself because we don't just have the documents from the state health department.
[00:13:51.504 --> 00:14:00.531]  We actually have a county going over this last month and breaking it down and asking the question, this is going to create a lot of new false cases.
[00:14:00.891 --> 00:14:02.312]  Rob News, the Infowars News Director.
[00:14:02.332 --> 00:14:03.653]  He's been following this for weeks.
[00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:04.774]  We're ready to break this right now.
[00:14:05.014 --> 00:14:08.238]  Yeah, that prophetic statement was made by Chris Hill, the county judge.
[00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:17.651]  Basically, he said, wow, with all these new parameters we're using to create COVID cases, they're using the word case very specifically, that we can have these inflated numbers.
[00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:22.517]  So it used to be, if you tested positive for COVID-19, that was one case.
[00:14:23.118 --> 00:14:30.363]  Now, if you have one case, they also look around it and see who you've been in contact with, and they say, OK, these are probable cases.
[00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.264]  These go into the caseload.
[00:14:32.744 --> 00:14:36.686]  And they use a lot of different parameters that we're going to go over just in one second.
[00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:41.970]  But one case could equal 17 cases, could equal 10 cases, could equal 20 cases.
[00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:42.910]  It doesn't matter.
[00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:45.372]  All it looks at is the word probable.
[00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:47.233]  And they add probable into the caseload.
[00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:51.836]  And now you've seen, since May 18th, when these were implemented in Texas, the numbers skyrocketing.
[00:14:52.216 --> 00:14:56.399]  And they confirm that if they say probable, that's now called a case.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.781]  So this is lawyer semantics.
[00:14:58.841 --> 00:15:06.687]  We've confirmed other states are following this same directive so they can turn the cases up or turn them down, the bureaucrats can, whenever they want.
[00:15:06.908 --> 00:15:07.308]  That's right.
[00:15:07.348 --> 00:15:08.269]  So let's go into these clips.
[00:15:08.289 --> 00:15:09.049]  We have clip one.
[00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.052]  This is where they talk about the case definitions being revised.
[00:15:13.172 --> 00:15:13.533]  Here it is.
[00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:26.777]  State of Texas DSHS has informed public health departments that they have adopted a revised definition for COVID-19 probable cases.
[00:15:27.337 --> 00:15:35.681]  Probable case definition was adopted by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists back in early April, April 4th or 5th.
[00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:36.482]  They adopted this.
[00:15:36.922 --> 00:15:40.824]  They sent it to the CDC and the CDC did take that recommendation and adopt it.
[00:15:41.144 --> 00:15:45.849]  And again, when you hear that, it's John Hopkins run by Bill Gates that runs the entire show.
[00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:47.070]  So it gets into all of it.
[00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:47.991]  They admit all of it.
[00:15:48.592 --> 00:15:49.413]  It's a total fraud.
[00:15:49.453 --> 00:15:51.695]  They admit they don't even test people to say they have COVID.
[00:15:52.216 --> 00:15:53.818]  This is beyond criminal.
[00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:56.718]  And that's how this has been done.
[00:15:56.878 --> 00:15:59.219]  And you've got the governor, who's not a doctor, doesn't know this.
[00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:01.220]  He's just hearing we have record cases.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.940]  You better do something.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.721]  And it's all a giant fraud.
[00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:06.322]  The governor needs to call for criminal investigation.
[00:16:06.402 --> 00:16:07.263]  The president does.
[00:16:07.863 --> 00:16:09.584]  And Fauci needs to be SWAT teamed now.
[00:16:10.184 --> 00:16:12.225]  This is their criminal fraud to keep America closed.
[00:16:12.565 --> 00:16:13.105]  They admit it.
[00:16:13.365 --> 00:16:15.887]  The full report's on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:16:16.147 --> 00:16:18.348]  But first, Roger Stone breaks his silence.
[00:16:18.988 --> 00:16:22.913]  And it's got so much to say to President Trump, you name it.
[00:16:23.334 --> 00:16:26.698]  Coming up on the other side, exclusive Roger Stone breaks the silence.
[00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:37.351]  He's been involved in more presidential elections than any other living advisor since the days of
[00:16:38.502 --> 00:16:42.765]  Richard Nixon, and he's the guy that got Donald Trump to run for office.
[00:16:43.405 --> 00:16:51.630]  Breaking his silence right now, the next three segments on this Tuesday edition is Roger Stone facing
[00:16:52.773 --> 00:16:53.994]  Alex, it's terrific to be back with you.
[00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.134]  It's kind of like old home week.
[00:16:55.194 --> 00:16:57.015]  And first and foremost,
[00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:29.587]  I want to thank you, and I want to thank InfoWars, and I want to thank the InfoWarriors out there in your audience who have stood by me through this entire epic struggle.
[00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:33.568]  I could never have made it this far.
[00:17:34.008 --> 00:17:39.769]  My family could never have survived this long without the support of each and every one of you.
[00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:41.930]  It has been gratifying.
[00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.250]  It has been extraordinary.
[00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.631]  It is only through the grace of God
[00:17:47.551 --> 00:18:09.602]  And for prayer and for the prayers of millions and millions of Americans, the contributions of thousands, tens of thousands of Americans that I have been able to fight and I am continuing to fight for my vindication and for justice in this extraordinary witch hunt.
[00:18:10.003 --> 00:18:12.824]  It has been nothing short of miraculous.
[00:18:12.844 --> 00:18:16.826]  So I want to thank you and the Infowar audience first and foremost.
[00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:22.003]  And for all of my friends at Infowars, it is really, really good to be back.
[00:18:22.483 --> 00:18:23.303]  It's good to have you here.
[00:18:23.363 --> 00:18:25.704]  Now, you said no questions off-limits all of a sudden.
[00:18:25.744 --> 00:18:29.025]  This weekend we talked, you said gloves are off, but wait till I go on air.
[00:18:30.305 --> 00:18:32.526]  What does it mean, nothing's off-limits?
[00:18:32.566 --> 00:18:36.448]  I mean, I don't people know what's happening behind the scenes and why you haven't been able to be on?
[00:18:36.828 --> 00:18:38.028]  You say nothing's off-limits.
[00:18:38.328 --> 00:18:42.530]  Should we hit that and then talk about the sequence of events that's all intertwined with Trump in 2020?
[00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:45.790]  Yeah, I think that's a good way to proceed.
[00:18:45.830 --> 00:19:05.440]  I think it's important to recognize that immediately after my Soviet-style show trial in Washington, D.C., in which the judge not only prohibited every powerful line of defense, but I also was faced with what was essentially a stacked jury, a jury that
[00:19:06.101 --> 00:19:19.770]  Included no Republicans, no conservatives, no military veterans, no info warriors, certainly, but could have passed for the Obama-Clinton Administration Alumni Association.
[00:19:20.571 --> 00:19:28.296]  Also included a number of Democratic Party activists, contributors to Donald Trump's 2020 donors.
[00:19:29.217 --> 00:19:32.259]  And then, of course, we had the post
[00:19:33.132 --> 00:19:42.724]  Trial revelations regarding the antics of the jury for a woman who indisputably posted on Twitter and Facebook
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:55.353]  During 2019, starting on the day of my arrest, and subsequently, individual posts attacking me, and many, many posts attacking President Trump.
[00:19:55.413 --> 00:20:03.702]  So, this is not someone who meets the Supreme Court's definition of impartial and indifferent.
[00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:33.329]  This was a Democratic Party activist, a Trump hater, a Stone hater, who essentially hid her bias during jury selection, had her social media platforms on a private setting during jury selection and during the trial, and then after the trial deleted those email posts, in fact deleted her entire page, so that the truth could not be known.
[00:20:33.929 --> 00:20:40.953]  Now, as you know, Alex, we filed a motion for a new trial based on the bias of the jury for Woman.
[00:20:41.713 --> 00:20:44.174]  I believe we demonstrated that bias.
[00:20:45.175 --> 00:20:52.839]  We specifically asked Judge Jackson for the ability to subpoena the deleted material from Facebook.
[00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:53.919]  The woman's M.O.
[00:20:53.959 --> 00:20:58.782]  was to place something on Facebook and then take the Facebook link and post it on Twitter.
[00:20:59.482 --> 00:21:02.584]  And, of course, that line of inquiry was denied.
[00:21:03.164 --> 00:21:18.753]  So we were somewhat surprised, as were many in the legal community, when I was not given a new trial, when my conviction, which I believe was wrongly decided anyway, was not vacated and I wasn't given a new trial.
[00:21:19.273 --> 00:21:35.682]  Just to be clear to everyone, I have filed an appeal not only of my bogus conviction, but I've also filed an appeal specifically of the decision by Jugs Jackson not to grant me a new trial, and those are pending.
[00:21:36.302 --> 00:21:39.504]  But in this process, an appeal is not immediate.
[00:21:39.644 --> 00:21:41.245]  It can take a year or longer.
[00:21:41.685 --> 00:21:44.727]  It can certainly cost as much as a million dollars.
[00:21:45.327 --> 00:21:47.869]  And in the short term, you're absolutely right.
[00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.489]  Even though
[00:21:49.386 --> 00:22:10.592]  Michael Avenatti, the Democrat super-lawyer who was a hyper-critic of the President, who stole $25 million from his clients, and faces additional charges, I believe, even though Michael Cohen, who was convicted of various financial crimes that don't involve Donald Trump... What about Harvey Weinstein, convicted of rape?
[00:22:10.912 --> 00:22:12.793]  He's out, but you've got to go to jail.
[00:22:13.653 --> 00:22:14.934]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary.
[00:22:14.974 --> 00:22:17.876]  So the Department of Justice's directives to the U.S.
[00:22:17.916 --> 00:22:30.343]  Bureau of Prison that non-violent or I should say inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be moved from incarceration to home confinement does not apply to Roger Stone.
[00:22:31.236 --> 00:22:52.178]  Therefore, my attorneys, my new attorneys, appealed that to Judge Jackson, which is the correct avenue, asking that instead of being sent to a prison in Jessup, Georgia, which is a very dicey situation and where the potential for infection of coronavirus, I think, is very real.
[00:22:53.257 --> 00:23:05.176]  Last Friday, very late on Friday afternoon, the judge essentially ignored the substance of our arguments, ordered me placed under immediate house arrest, which is where I am right now.
[00:23:06.314 --> 00:23:12.116]  And added that I had two weeks to settle my affairs and report to the President in Georgia.
[00:23:12.136 --> 00:23:13.296]  And that's my quick question.
[00:23:13.416 --> 00:23:17.537]  You weren't going to do interviews until whether clemency, pardon, or whatever was going to happen.
[00:23:17.817 --> 00:23:20.238]  What made you change the last few days and now be here?
[00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:22.019]  You're going to get into 2020, the election.
[00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:25.179]  You're warning Trump coming up in a few segments.
[00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:27.580]  But what made you say the gloves are off?
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.261]  Any questions you want to ask?
[00:23:29.301 --> 00:23:30.381]  You know, everything's on the table.
[00:23:31.141 --> 00:23:38.287]  Because I'm vitally concerned about the direction of this country, and I think it is incredibly important to re-elect the President.
[00:23:38.787 --> 00:23:42.871]  I see the way they have destroyed his whole card, the American economy.
[00:23:43.311 --> 00:23:48.015]  I see the way our streets are burning under a violent socialist revolution in our streets.
[00:23:48.455 --> 00:23:51.417]  And therefore, the sooner I could speak out, the better.
[00:23:51.517 --> 00:23:53.059]  I cannot stand the idea
[00:23:53.659 --> 00:24:01.742]  That I will either be six feet under or incarcerated in October of 2020 when I need to be on the battlefield.
[00:24:02.142 --> 00:24:04.103]  That's why I decided to speak out today.
[00:24:04.363 --> 00:24:09.465]  And you told me that in confidence, but now you're just throwing it all to the wind, which I really respect you even more now.
[00:24:09.485 --> 00:24:10.845]  I want you to say it in your own words.
[00:24:11.206 --> 00:24:15.047]  You're not here for you because you know you'll be penalized by this judge and others for speaking out.
[00:24:15.307 --> 00:24:16.968]  You're here because you're really worried about Trump.
[00:24:16.988 --> 00:24:19.190]  This isn't like some leftist, oh Trump's in trouble.
[00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.613]  We need to be honest just like you were 120 something days out last time to Trump.
[00:24:24.013 --> 00:24:27.575]  You need to warn him and undoubtedly the President is going to get this message from you.
[00:24:27.595 --> 00:24:41.445]  So let's finish up with what happened to you, where this is all going, it's part of the Russiagate hoax, and then let's tie it into what Trump needs to do because believe me obviously, you issue a message to President Trump here on the Alex Jones Show, he's going to get it and he needs your counsel.
[00:24:42.405 --> 00:24:49.327]  Pardon you, not just clemency, immediately and then put it in their face and put you in the White House where Bannon was.
[00:24:49.547 --> 00:24:51.267]  He would win the election, I have no doubt.
[00:24:51.667 --> 00:24:55.768]  He needs to double down and own it instead of running away from you, which he's not been doing.
[00:24:55.788 --> 00:24:58.929]  He's been saying Stone's innocent and tweeting how it's all fraud.
[00:24:59.269 --> 00:25:01.909]  So Trump gets these in the fight of his life right now.
[00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:02.510]  We're all in it.
[00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:03.250]  Stay with us.
[00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.490]  Roger Stone straight ahead.
[00:25:08.337 --> 00:25:14.659]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:23.803]  And Roger Stone is here with us exclusively because he's so worried about President Trump and the country and what's happened in the election.
[00:25:24.123 --> 00:25:26.744]  They want him in prison for helping get Trump elected.
[00:25:27.184 --> 00:25:29.565]  They want him in prison for getting Trump to run.
[00:25:30.065 --> 00:25:31.786]  And they want to send a message to everybody else.
[00:25:32.606 --> 00:25:38.650]  I did with General Flynn and Manafort, everybody, and how they're trying to indict me and put me in jail and sue me to death.
[00:25:39.011 --> 00:25:41.312]  That you don't stand up for America, I will punish you.
[00:25:41.352 --> 00:25:44.315]  That's why this election is so important for this country and the world.
[00:25:44.615 --> 00:25:56.684]  So Roger Stone, I want to finish up with the persecution you've gone through and what's happening and the death sentence this judge is trying to send you to in two weeks and what happened in the trial and then what people really want to hear your expertise on.
[00:25:57.464 --> 00:26:01.485]  The 2020 contest and what you think President Trump needs to do.
[00:26:01.865 --> 00:26:02.846]  So, Roger, please continue.
[00:26:02.866 --> 00:26:03.806]  All right.
[00:26:03.886 --> 00:26:04.606]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:26:04.946 --> 00:26:06.166]  Again, it's great to be back.
[00:26:07.087 --> 00:26:14.969]  First, let me say that my affection and loyalty and support for this president have never flagged for a nanosecond.
[00:26:14.989 --> 00:26:22.231]  If you go back through his tweets at the time my house was charged by 29 heavily armed FBI agents.
[00:26:22.631 --> 00:26:40.670]  To the time I was wrongfully convicted, to the time I was subjected to the corruption of this jury forewoman, as recently as last Saturday morning when at 7am the President retweeted
[00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:55.366]  A tweet by Lori Hendry urging people to sign the petition at FreeRogerStone.com to the President, urging that he grant an act of clemency and either a pardon or a commutation of sentence.
[00:26:55.706 --> 00:27:01.813]  The President has correctly recognized my persecution as a miscarriage of justice, his words.
[00:27:02.693 --> 00:27:14.818]  He has said as recently as last week on Sean Hannity's terrific show that I was treated very, very unfairly, that my conviction should have been thrown out, I should have been declared a mistrial.
[00:27:15.238 --> 00:27:18.380]  So I have no complaints about the President whatsoever.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:24.062]  I stand with him and I think ultimately, I pray ultimately, that he will stand with me.
[00:27:25.122 --> 00:27:32.166]  As for my trial, you know that first thing they had to do was to slap a gag order on me.
[00:27:32.266 --> 00:27:38.330]  An unconstitutional gag order that held that I could not defend myself in any public forum.
[00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.652]  Not InfoWars, not social media, not Fox, nowhere.
[00:27:43.373 --> 00:27:52.678]  And that's because they claimed that any social media commentary or defense of me might taint the jury.
[00:27:53.198 --> 00:27:57.421]  This is an absurd argument for which the judge offered no evidence, no proof.
[00:27:57.741 --> 00:28:03.626]  In fact, what about the tainting of the jury by the Washington Post or by CNN?
[00:28:04.306 --> 00:28:10.030]  The tsunami of fake news, which if you go back and look for 16 months here, what did they say?
[00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.412]  Roger Stone will be indicted for treason.
[00:28:12.832 --> 00:28:15.454]  Roger Stone will be charged by Mueller for conspiracy.
[00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:18.815]  Roger Stone will be charged for conspiracy against the United States.
[00:28:18.855 --> 00:28:21.216]  And they've had to admit no Russian collusion.
[00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:22.416]  Bar has come out.
[00:28:22.456 --> 00:28:25.677]  They've confirmed no Russian collusion by any US citizen.
[00:28:25.937 --> 00:28:27.718]  What an incredibly loyal country.
[00:28:28.118 --> 00:28:30.059]  All you did was get Trump elected.
[00:28:31.139 --> 00:28:32.780]  Well, Trump got Trump elected.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.841]  All I did was support Donald Trump and never flagged in that support.
[00:28:36.921 --> 00:28:38.582]  Look, I admit that going back to 1988,
[00:28:40.026 --> 00:29:02.478]  Maybe I was one of the first people, right after former President Nixon, to recognize that Donald Trump had the courage, and the bravado, and the audacity, and the independence, and the energy, and the stamina, and the anti-globalist worldview to be not only a great candidate for president, but a truly great president.
[00:29:02.498 --> 00:29:03.319]  He also had the looks.
[00:29:04.304 --> 00:29:05.545]  He's charismatic.
[00:29:05.585 --> 00:29:07.967]  He understood television in the television age.
[00:29:08.388 --> 00:29:11.230]  But let's be honest, he delivered in spades.
[00:29:12.171 --> 00:29:16.695]  They said when he became president, look, America's greatest days are behind us.
[00:29:16.996 --> 00:29:19.918]  For structural reasons, we'll never bring back our economy.
[00:29:19.958 --> 00:29:22.280]  Those manufacturing jobs, they're gone forever.
[00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:27.305]  We just have to take a back bench in the global economy and accept our fate.
[00:29:27.845 --> 00:29:30.087]  And Donald Trump said no, wrong.
[00:29:30.507 --> 00:29:45.417]  And with an extraordinarily comprehensive program of tax reduction, regulatory reduction, and redoing the trade deals that were stealing all of our jobs, he gave us the greatest single economic boom in American history.
[00:29:45.877 --> 00:29:57.325]  We had record job creation, we had record wage growth, and employment among all categories, among all peoples, was higher in this country than it has ever been before.
[00:29:58.185 --> 00:30:00.506]  He rebuilt the strength of our military.
[00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:06.507]  He fought endlessly to close our southern border to make our streets and neighborhoods safer.
[00:30:06.527 --> 00:30:12.989]  But then Bill Maher said we should plunge the economy and they've used COVID-19 to shut the economy down.
[00:30:13.609 --> 00:30:16.110]  What is your warning to the President?
[00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.271]  What is your advice to the President, Roger Stone?
[00:30:20.131 --> 00:30:23.954]  Well, first of all, the President has an obligation to protect the public health.
[00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:39.028]  And when you had all of these scientists making what we then thought were legitimate projections about the rate of infection and the danger of this, I think the President did the only thing he could do, which was to proceed cautiously and close the country down.
[00:30:39.548 --> 00:30:45.013]  You know he didn't like slowing and killing our economy, but he does have an obligation to protect the public health.
[00:30:45.453 --> 00:30:47.654]  And by the way, COVID virus is real.
[00:30:48.035 --> 00:30:48.735]  It's dangerous.
[00:30:49.015 --> 00:30:50.776]  I know people who have died from it.
[00:30:50.876 --> 00:30:53.658]  Members of my family know people who have died from it.
[00:30:53.898 --> 00:30:55.959]  This is not a hoax by any means.
[00:30:56.099 --> 00:30:59.481]  It is a very real current danger.
[00:30:59.922 --> 00:31:05.525]  But at the same time, none of the projections that most of the scientists make panned out.
[00:31:06.212 --> 00:31:14.600]  The good news is that only through the bold leadership of the President do we close our country to China early, or this could have been much, much worse.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.343]  Now I say to you, the way I would frame this is quite obvious.
[00:31:19.964 --> 00:31:21.526]  Our economy is now in shambles.
[00:31:22.304 --> 00:31:23.906]  Who do we want to lead us forward?
[00:31:24.346 --> 00:31:37.098]  A man who has proven that he knows how to revive the economy and bring us to record levels of productivity and prosperity, or a man whose prescription will make the sick patient even sicker?
[00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:39.761]  We know that Trump has the keys to this.
[00:31:39.801 --> 00:31:40.962]  He's already proven it.
[00:31:41.303 --> 00:31:42.424]  This is not conjecture.
[00:31:42.784 --> 00:31:43.805]  This is a fact.
[00:31:44.186 --> 00:31:45.167]  He knows what to do.
[00:31:45.227 --> 00:31:52.775]  In fact, if you saw the last jobs report, the Trump program of tax and regulatory reduction is already working.
[00:31:52.795 --> 00:31:54.737]  We're already on our way back.
[00:31:55.297 --> 00:32:08.821]  Whereas, under Joe Biden, if we increase taxes, we increase regulation, we increase spending, and we redo these trade deals that have been bad for America, the economy won't get better, it will actually get worse.
[00:32:09.242 --> 00:32:11.242]  That is the choice that Americans have.
[00:32:11.542 --> 00:32:15.484]  A man that has shown he knows how to do it, or a man who will make things worse.
[00:32:15.864 --> 00:32:18.525]  That is the stark reality of the 2020 election.
[00:32:19.965 --> 00:32:22.846]  It's very clear the Democrats helped run it in the ground.
[00:32:22.886 --> 00:32:23.846]  They helped hype it up.
[00:32:24.286 --> 00:32:25.647]  They cheerleaded for it to fall.
[00:32:25.767 --> 00:32:27.087]  They screwed it up beforehand.
[00:32:27.367 --> 00:32:31.908]  Do we want the guy that fixed it before when they said, when Krugman said he couldn't, everybody else said he couldn't?
[00:32:32.208 --> 00:32:34.109]  Or do we want to put these losers?
[00:32:34.229 --> 00:32:42.571]  Why is the Democrat field so bizarrely weak with Biden saying 120 million died from COVID and Pelosi looking completely insane?
[00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:45.192]  I mean, what the hell is wrong with these people?
[00:32:46.035 --> 00:32:53.038]  Well, let's not lose sight of the fact that they are propped up by a malicious, vicious, fake news media.
[00:32:53.578 --> 00:33:03.263]  I mean, look, we've said it on this program before, if Donald Trump cured cancer tomorrow, found the cure for cancer, the headline would be, Trump puts doctors out of work.
[00:33:03.783 --> 00:33:07.885]  I mean, the president is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.
[00:33:08.545 --> 00:33:12.306]  We have a violent social revolution going on in the streets.
[00:33:12.767 --> 00:33:15.508]  If the president mobilizes our military to crush
[00:33:16.268 --> 00:33:24.211]  The rebellion, they'll say, oh, he's a Hitler, he's a Nazi, and then when he doesn't, they say, oh, he's letting the streets burn and the cities burn, and he's doing nothing.
[00:33:24.511 --> 00:33:44.019]  Look, the guy can't do anything right, yet I'm absolutely convinced, despite these unfair criticisms by the mainstream media, by the vicious tsunami of fake news that rains on him and his family unfairly every single day, that he is the man to lead America.
[00:33:44.079 --> 00:33:45.520]  And all of these stories that
[00:33:46.072 --> 00:33:48.413]  He's having second thoughts about re-election.
[00:33:48.494 --> 00:33:49.374]  He's dejected.
[00:33:49.434 --> 00:33:50.155]  He's depressed.
[00:33:50.215 --> 00:33:51.135]  He's not going to run.
[00:33:51.615 --> 00:33:53.517]  That's not the Donald Trump that I know.
[00:33:53.597 --> 00:33:56.158]  Now, I have no inside information, but I know this.
[00:33:56.579 --> 00:33:57.819]  Donald Trump is a fighter.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.941]  Donald Trump is a brawler.
[00:34:00.701 --> 00:34:04.844]  Who wouldn't be upset about the destruction of your signature poll card?
[00:34:05.184 --> 00:34:08.426]  The most vibrant, robust economy in American history.
[00:34:09.046 --> 00:34:11.427]  You can see why he is unhappy about that.
[00:34:11.767 --> 00:34:15.108]  But only one man can lead us back to prosperity.
[00:34:15.428 --> 00:34:16.229]  How do I know that?
[00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:18.149]  Because he's done it before.
[00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:19.530]  It isn't conjecture.
[00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:20.670]  It isn't a guess.
[00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.271]  It isn't a subjective question.
[00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:28.133]  Donald Trump has proven he knows how to create jobs and economic wealth.
[00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:30.874]  A man who did it once can do it again.
[00:34:31.394 --> 00:34:34.557]  All right, Roger Stone's with us for one more segment.
[00:34:35.017 --> 00:34:42.083]  I've got thousands of questions, but I'm giving him the floor because it's just like he said, it's great to have him back on air.
[00:34:42.123 --> 00:34:44.085]  It's great to hear his voice, to see him talking.
[00:34:44.485 --> 00:34:49.389]  You know, that's all been blocked by this judge, but now he's thrown all that to the wind because he's so worried about the country.
[00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:50.190]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:54.273]  Just a few minutes on the other side of this exclusive interview with Roger Stone.
[00:34:54.313 --> 00:34:55.514]  Please spread the live links.
[00:35:15.336 --> 00:35:16.377]  We're living in America.
[00:35:16.397 --> 00:35:23.204]  He didn't want to take credit for it, but it's like, yeah, you, you, you, you train a boxer, you put them in the ring.
[00:35:23.244 --> 00:35:25.847]  He didn't get the credit as a boxer, but he did help Donald Trump.
[00:35:26.348 --> 00:35:28.310]  You want to blame somebody or give them an award.
[00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:32.014]  Roger Stone is as important as anybody out there.
[00:35:32.034 --> 00:35:35.257]  Probably the most important other than Donald Trump for getting Trump to run.
[00:35:35.277 --> 00:35:36.939]  And I'm very thankful that Trump has run.
[00:35:37.489 --> 00:35:40.075]  I've been persecuted mightily for it, but you know what?
[00:35:40.776 --> 00:35:42.540]  All the good things in life you get persecuted for.
[00:35:42.921 --> 00:35:44.444]  Roger, we only got like 10 minutes left.
[00:35:44.484 --> 00:35:46.849]  Maybe I could twist your arm and do five more, but you gotta go, I know, here.
[00:35:48.144 --> 00:35:49.204]  I've got so many questions.
[00:35:49.564 --> 00:35:50.945]  Obviously, I haven't talked to Trump in a while.
[00:35:50.965 --> 00:35:52.045]  They're talking about clemency.
[00:35:52.105 --> 00:35:53.085]  They're talking about pardons.
[00:35:53.125 --> 00:35:56.666]  He said Roger has nothing to worry about in major tweets he's put out.
[00:35:57.246 --> 00:35:58.346]  Let's talk about that.
[00:35:58.366 --> 00:36:02.147]  I know you don't want to mess anything up, but what are you expecting?
[00:36:02.207 --> 00:36:03.087]  What are you thinking?
[00:36:03.707 --> 00:36:07.328]  What is the thinking on when you should get clemency or a pardon?
[00:36:07.348 --> 00:36:10.189]  Because Trump wants to repudiate this whole Russiagate hoax.
[00:36:11.038 --> 00:36:13.099]  Well, first of all, I have no inside information.
[00:36:13.159 --> 00:36:14.420]  I've been promised nothing.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.881]  I've been assured nothing.
[00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:23.646]  So I can't tell you really what's going to happen, other than the fact that July 14th is an absolute drop-dead date.
[00:36:24.566 --> 00:36:25.667]  Why do they want to do this?
[00:36:25.727 --> 00:36:26.788]  It's very simple, Alex.
[00:36:28.328 --> 00:36:36.251]  The Deep State and Judge Jackson would like me to die in a COVID-infested prison before my appeal is heard a year from now.
[00:36:36.291 --> 00:36:48.515]  Because when my appeal is heard, the epic corruption of my trial, of the judge, of her clerks, of the Mueller prosecutors is going to be exposed.
[00:36:48.915 --> 00:37:01.282]  And they can't afford that, which is why I have, in essence, for a series of completely fabricated process crimes, I'm essentially getting capital punishment, the death penalty.
[00:37:01.683 --> 00:37:03.184]  That's what this is tantamount to.
[00:37:03.584 --> 00:37:10.628]  So one of the important things I wanted to do here today is appeal to your audience, to appeal to the President,
[00:37:11.288 --> 00:37:34.135]  To, as a humanitarian act of both mercy and justice, to use his extraordinary powers of clemency so that I can avoid dying in a dank, squalid prison someplace, when I should be on the battlefield doing everything I humanly can, on my own, I'm not looking for a job, to re-elect this president.
[00:37:34.235 --> 00:37:35.235]  It's that important.
[00:37:35.775 --> 00:37:50.142]  I honestly believe that this country will hurtle over the cliff towards globalism and that we will have chaos in America and there is only one man with the courage and the stamina and the fortitude to stop it.
[00:37:50.837 --> 00:37:52.358]  I saw it a long time ago.
[00:37:52.778 --> 00:37:53.839]  Let's be very clear.
[00:37:53.999 --> 00:37:57.241]  Donald Trump is responsible for the election of Donald Trump.
[00:37:57.622 --> 00:37:58.142]  And he's right.
[00:37:58.302 --> 00:38:01.124]  I had no formal role in his campaign.
[00:38:01.484 --> 00:38:16.174]  I was doing everything I could, including the publication of my book, The Clinton's War on Women, which I still think is not only the definitive opposition research on the Clintons and their epic corruption, but is one of the main reasons why I was targeted.
[00:38:16.574 --> 00:38:18.836]  Here's something interesting that we learned, Alex, when
[00:38:19.276 --> 00:38:21.580]  Rod Rosenstein testified before the U.S.
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.664]  Senate Judiciary Committee a couple weeks ago.
[00:38:24.465 --> 00:38:30.215]  He admitted that the investigation into Roger Stone was not opened until October of 2017.
[00:38:31.874 --> 00:38:42.960]  That means three months after Robert Mueller already knew there was no Russian collusion, proving that my persecution was a political hit job.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.342]  They knew I had no involvement with the Russians.
[00:38:46.182 --> 00:38:52.846]  And then Rosenstein, in that same under oath testimony, went on to say that he is not the one who approved it.
[00:38:53.567 --> 00:39:00.669]  But that was a lie because the scope memo that authorized the investigation into me was signed by Rosenstein himself.
[00:39:00.729 --> 00:39:13.833]  It's a public document now, thanks to the heroic efforts of Rick Grinnell, one of the president's greatest temporary appointees and ultimately one of the real stars of this administration, who got the documents declassified to prove me.
[00:39:13.993 --> 00:39:24.659]  And by the way, I was about to say, in those new documents, Strzok and Page are admitting that Obama and Biden ordered all this, not just during the campaign, but after they were out of office.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.181]  That is smoking gun illegality.
[00:39:27.441 --> 00:39:28.682]  Trump's called it treason.
[00:39:29.282 --> 00:39:31.904]  What do you think we should expect if Trump gets re-elected?
[00:39:32.044 --> 00:39:37.307]  Because like you said, his philosophy is he doesn't attack, but if you do attack, he strikes back ten times harder.
[00:39:38.208 --> 00:39:39.128]  He said that himself.
[00:39:39.188 --> 00:39:39.909]  What do you expect?
[00:39:40.169 --> 00:39:41.970]  They've got to be really scared if he gets re-elected.
[00:39:42.776 --> 00:39:45.018]  Well, it's a backwards world.
[00:39:45.038 --> 00:39:51.303]  You hear people like Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff talking about how Bill Barr and Donald Trump are destroying the rule of law.
[00:39:51.603 --> 00:39:52.944]  What are these guys talking about?
[00:39:53.384 --> 00:40:01.050]  They weren't screaming when Loretta Lynch, as Attorney General, wired the investigation into Hillary Clinton and her illegal email server.
[00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:07.795]  They weren't screaming when Eric Holder basically snubbed the Congress on Fast and Furious
[00:40:10.237 --> 00:40:20.344]  And let's face it, the Obama administration has been caught red-handed, indisputably, in the greatest single abuse of power in American history.
[00:40:20.384 --> 00:40:22.065]  So how does Trump go on the offense?
[00:40:22.446 --> 00:40:23.606]  How does Trump go on the offense?
[00:40:23.947 --> 00:40:26.308]  I think we have to make sure people understand what happened here.
[00:40:26.428 --> 00:40:29.711]  They used the full authority of the United States
[00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:33.034]  So this wasn't just a coup against Trump, it was a coup against the Republican rule of law?
[00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:47.183]  There's no question about it.
[00:40:47.223 --> 00:40:58.766]  They were trying to undo the results of the 2016 elections, and we now know definitively that there was never any legal, legitimate basis for the opening of this investigation.
[00:40:58.786 --> 00:41:01.427]  And imagine if Nixon tried something like this.
[00:41:01.467 --> 00:41:03.168]  He just thought about little stuff.
[00:41:03.508 --> 00:41:06.429]  This is so much more gargantuan and red-handed.
[00:41:06.769 --> 00:41:08.469]  We hear about the CIA overthrowing countries.
[00:41:08.729 --> 00:41:10.510]  This is America they tried to overthrow.
[00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.771]  It's really quite extraordinary.
[00:41:13.811 --> 00:41:14.591]  Look, this has been a
[00:41:15.652 --> 00:41:17.733]  Difficult and debilitating fight.
[00:41:17.874 --> 00:41:19.835]  I mean, I will admit to you that I am tired.
[00:41:20.575 --> 00:41:21.356]  I am battered.
[00:41:22.557 --> 00:41:23.878]  I was about to ask you though, Roger.
[00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:24.558]  I don't mean to interrupt.
[00:41:24.618 --> 00:41:27.740]  What is it like to be at the super center of history?
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.462]  I don't envy you, but I kind of do.
[00:41:29.542 --> 00:41:32.203]  I mean, you are a major historical figure now.
[00:41:32.264 --> 00:41:33.905]  This is beyond witch hunt.
[00:41:33.925 --> 00:41:35.546]  I mean, this is beyond Salem trials.
[00:41:35.886 --> 00:41:36.967]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:41:37.927 --> 00:41:41.010]  Well, if I had my choice, I would wish somebody else was in this place.
[00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.831]  But saying what, just to follow up,
[00:41:43.997 --> 00:41:45.037]  Let me say a couple things.
[00:41:45.538 --> 00:41:47.119]  I'm not yet finished.
[00:41:47.239 --> 00:41:50.262]  The final chapter of Roger Stone is not written.
[00:41:51.123 --> 00:41:53.244]  I have put my faith completely in God.
[00:41:53.264 --> 00:41:55.186]  We've talked about that privately.
[00:41:55.206 --> 00:42:00.971]  I was very, very fortunate back in January to meet Reverend Franklin Graham.
[00:42:01.751 --> 00:42:07.537]  As a 12-year-old boy, I saw Billy Graham's preach to a tent revival in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
[00:42:07.557 --> 00:42:09.999]  It was one of the greatest experiences of my life.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.404]  I still remember how charismatic he was, how riveting he was.
[00:42:15.825 --> 00:42:19.869]  When I was working for President Richard Nixon, I had the opportunity to meet him and shake his hand.
[00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:24.393]  I think Reverend Billy Graham was one of the greatest figures of this century.
[00:42:24.873 --> 00:42:34.462]  I had the absolute privilege to meet his son, Franklin Graham, at a time, Alex, that my life was in absolute turmoil.
[00:42:34.983 --> 00:42:35.624]  I was worried.
[00:42:36.084 --> 00:42:36.825]  I was angry.
[00:42:37.065 --> 00:42:38.126]  I was frustrated.
[00:42:39.147 --> 00:42:40.949]  Really, I was not sleeping.
[00:42:40.969 --> 00:42:42.290]  It was horrific.
[00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:47.095]  And I spilled out my heart to Reverend Graham, and he said, you know, there's a simple answer to this.
[00:42:47.904 --> 00:42:51.125]  You need to turn your life back over to Jesus Christ.
[00:42:51.465 --> 00:42:58.247]  You need to confess your sins and get right with Jesus, and I absolutely guarantee you, God will protect you.
[00:42:58.347 --> 00:42:59.888]  God will walk with you.
[00:43:00.028 --> 00:43:03.989]  If you try to live within His laws, He will protect you.
[00:43:04.509 --> 00:43:18.417]  I thought about that, and then on that very same day, I stood with 500 others in a public park in Boca Raton, and I witnessed before God, I confessed my sins, because there's no question in my younger days, I had some pretty wild times.
[00:43:18.937 --> 00:43:22.640]  And then Reverend Graham sent me a Bible with certain sections annotated.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.322]  I'll be honest with you, whenever I get angry, whenever I get frustrated, I go back to that Bible.
[00:43:27.582 --> 00:43:33.426]  But you told me back at the time, privately, that the Depression ended, and suddenly your fortunes turned.
[00:43:33.986 --> 00:43:35.147]  Like, the next day?
[00:43:36.728 --> 00:43:37.668]  There is no question.
[00:43:37.768 --> 00:43:38.609]  It is amazing.
[00:43:38.689 --> 00:43:47.454]  As soon as I put this all in the hands of God, as soon as I professed again and reaffirmed my belief in Jesus Christ, because I was born as a Catholic.
[00:43:47.894 --> 00:43:49.755]  I got all my sacraments in that church.
[00:43:49.855 --> 00:43:51.156]  I am still a Catholic.
[00:43:52.276 --> 00:43:54.337]  I am, more importantly, a Christian.
[00:43:55.038 --> 00:43:57.819]  And I believe that I am protected by God.
[00:43:57.879 --> 00:44:00.601]  And in the end, I will win this epic struggle.
[00:44:01.462 --> 00:44:06.871]  So you've publicly already loved God, but now you've publicly chosen a side.
[00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:07.872]  That's what God wants.
[00:44:09.014 --> 00:44:10.096]  Well, there's no question.
[00:44:10.396 --> 00:44:15.725]  You know, I have been enormously given enormous strength
[00:44:16.346 --> 00:44:17.447]  We're good to go.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:44.906]  First of all, you can get the original Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong t-shirt at Infowars in the store.
[00:44:45.286 --> 00:44:51.392]  Now this is important because these are limited and this particular t-shirt is going to end up in the Smithsonian.
[00:44:51.772 --> 00:44:56.777]  So my advice to you is to get this collector's item while they are still available.
[00:44:57.117 --> 00:44:59.820]  There are not going to be any more of them made.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:07.985]  If you want to help me in this epic fight immediately, sign the petition at FreeRogerStone.com.
[00:45:08.025 --> 00:45:10.607]  That's FreeRogerStone.com.
[00:45:10.747 --> 00:45:27.439]  It is a petition to the President, urging him, as an act of humanity, and in the name of justice and mercy, to extend clemency, grant clemency to me, either in the form of a commutation of sentence, so I may pursue my appeal, or a pardon.
[00:45:27.899 --> 00:45:31.403]  And lastly, if you want to help me in the horrific expense... Hold on!
[00:45:31.423 --> 00:45:32.444]  You've got to do five more minutes.
[00:45:32.464 --> 00:45:33.265]  We're back in two minutes.
[00:45:33.285 --> 00:45:35.907]  We've got to go do five more minutes, Roger Stone, to finish up.
[00:45:41.713 --> 00:45:46.658]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:50.133]  Alright, I really like Roger Stone.
[00:45:50.173 --> 00:45:52.975]  I met him like eight years ago at a JFK event in Dallas.
[00:45:53.015 --> 00:45:55.396]  And then got to know him early in the Trump campaign.
[00:45:55.416 --> 00:45:56.417]  We became really good friends.
[00:45:56.457 --> 00:45:58.979]  But I'd get mad at him because he was just saying, I'm not a Russian agent.
[00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:00.360]  He was co-hosting the War Room.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:01.480]  I'm like, dude, we all know that.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.041]  We're sick of it.
[00:46:02.061 --> 00:46:03.021]  But he was fighting for his life.
[00:46:03.302 --> 00:46:04.022]  Then he got indicted.
[00:46:04.062 --> 00:46:05.043]  And I was like, oh, you were right.
[00:46:05.743 --> 00:46:06.804]  It just sounded so crazy.
[00:46:06.824 --> 00:46:09.306]  I knew we weren't involved with the Russians or WikiLeaks or any of this.
[00:46:10.227 --> 00:46:20.896]  I just can't wait till he's pardoned or has clemency so he can be in this campaign and he can be on air and talking about Nixon and talking about the Clintons and just having his speech.
[00:46:20.976 --> 00:46:25.600]  And so, Roger, in closing, I want you to plug the new t-shirt to fund it because I know what lawyers cost.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.102]  I know you've lost your house, everything.
[00:46:27.322 --> 00:46:28.042]  People need to support you.
[00:46:28.062 --> 00:46:29.524]  But just before we do that,
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:41.542]  I know you say Trump might be in trouble, that's why you're here or whatever, but what finally got you really mad and made you say, screw it, I've been told not to have my free speech, I'm going to do it?
[00:46:42.362 --> 00:46:54.345]  Well, first of all, the official gag order was dropped at the time that the judge decided not to grant me a new trial and ordered that I be incarcerated.
[00:46:55.035 --> 00:46:59.220]  Uh, no less than three weeks after, pardon me, no, yes, no less than three weeks.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.242]  Can we talk about the other stuff that was there?
[00:47:01.262 --> 00:47:02.203]  There was some other things.
[00:47:03.049 --> 00:47:10.135]  Well, then the Federal Bureau of Prisons first assigned me a date of June 30th.
[00:47:10.615 --> 00:47:13.277]  We filed, as I said, an emergency motion to fight that.
[00:47:13.637 --> 00:47:20.663]  But I'm now free to say what I want, and I am deeply concerned about this next election being stolen.
[00:47:21.163 --> 00:47:26.968]  The idea of a mail-in ballot system is an open invitation for voter fraud.
[00:47:27.682 --> 00:47:33.027]  Twelve states' constitutions specifically require in-person voting.
[00:47:33.067 --> 00:47:34.648]  They don't even have absentee voting.
[00:47:35.129 --> 00:47:40.433]  Twenty-five, pardon me, thirty-five states require the showing of a photo ID.
[00:47:40.813 --> 00:47:50.222]  So you cannot just run roughshod over state constitutions and state law requiring what it takes to vote by federal fiat.
[00:47:50.362 --> 00:47:51.703]  It doesn't work that way.
[00:47:52.103 --> 00:47:54.687]  But you can see what the Democrats are up to.
[00:47:55.128 --> 00:47:57.852]  They have the weakest candidate in their history.
[00:47:58.348 --> 00:48:11.672]  Joe Biden is personally responsible through the 1994 crime bill for the mass incarceration of more black people, more African Americans, more people of color than anyone currently in American politics.
[00:48:12.132 --> 00:48:18.954]  The harsh mandatory penalties for the first time nonviolent crime of possession of small amounts of drugs.
[00:48:19.394 --> 00:48:26.197]  The turbocharging of the war on drugs has been a social, economic, racist failure.
[00:48:26.417 --> 00:48:27.517]  It has not worked.
[00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:40.334]  He's ruining lives, he's ruining families, no one is being rehabilitated, and if you're a conservative, you're paying billions now in taxes to house and feed people who are not violent criminals.
[00:48:40.394 --> 00:48:42.535]  This is one of the best issues for Donald Trump.
[00:48:42.655 --> 00:48:42.975]  Why?
[00:48:43.355 --> 00:48:52.880]  Because Donald Trump, under the Second Chance Act, is the person giving these people, who are locked in the bowels of our penal system for 15, 20, 25 years, a second chance at
[00:48:55.882 --> 00:48:57.284]  And he's also anti-war.
[00:48:57.344 --> 00:49:01.070]  I think you should start doing weekly addresses to the nation, like 8 p.m.
[00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:04.114]  Central, and laying this out at the Oval Office.
[00:49:04.134 --> 00:49:06.137]  You should use the power of the Oval Office.
[00:49:06.177 --> 00:49:06.918]  We're almost out of time.
[00:49:07.199 --> 00:49:11.024]  Tell folks about the new shirt, Roger Stone still did nothing wrong, and how folks support you.
[00:49:12.066 --> 00:49:17.128]  You can go to StoneDefenseFund.com because I have to file my appeal.
[00:49:17.648 --> 00:49:27.091]  If the President, in his wisdom, decides to commute my sentence, I still have to pay for a million dollar appeal to overturn my conviction.
[00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:37.074]  If the President pardons me, well then this fight is finally over and I can get back to making a living and finishing a book and writing yet another book.
[00:49:37.454 --> 00:49:39.515]  And I pray for that every single day.
[00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:47.140]  If you want to get a t-shirt like the one I am wearing, you can go to fightback.store.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.801]  That's fightback.store.
[00:49:49.242 --> 00:49:57.948]  But I urge you to go to the InfoWars site to get the original, because there's a very, very limited number of those, and they will not be available again.
[00:49:57.968 --> 00:49:58.428]  Well, that's right.
[00:49:58.448 --> 00:49:59.129]  We're almost sold out.
[00:49:59.149 --> 00:50:00.570]  But, Roger, don't worry about us.
[00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:02.351]  I mean, we're all in this together.
[00:50:02.431 --> 00:50:03.172]  You're a target.
[00:50:03.192 --> 00:50:03.892]  You're a beta test.
[00:50:03.912 --> 00:50:04.453]  They've told me.
[00:50:04.833 --> 00:50:06.075]  Behind the scenes, you know what's going on.
[00:50:06.475 --> 00:50:08.037]  If they can get you, they're going to indict me.
[00:50:08.277 --> 00:50:11.441]  But they're still going to... They get rid of Trump, the whole Russia thing is going to start back up.
[00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:15.045]  I mean, they still have groups of Democrats in there operating.
[00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.147]  I think overall, Bill Barr is a good guy.
[00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:19.410]  I just don't think people realize how dangerous this is.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.261]  Well, there's no question.
[00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:26.585]  That's why we have to do whatever is humanly possible necessary to to re-elect the president.
[00:50:26.625 --> 00:50:30.349]  What really makes me sick is these country club Republicans are already leaking.
[00:50:30.909 --> 00:50:32.170]  Oh, we're in panic mode.
[00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:33.351]  We're going to lose the Senate.
[00:50:33.411 --> 00:50:34.452]  Trump's a sure loser.
[00:50:34.512 --> 00:50:35.373]  That's Roger Stone.
[00:50:35.413 --> 00:50:36.014]  Hold on, folks.
[00:50:44.042 --> 00:50:52.824]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:58.305]  Well, Roger Stone's a really smart guy and a funny guy and a talented guy and a good friend of mine.
[00:50:58.625 --> 00:51:00.745]  We've been through the wars together the last five years.
[00:51:00.865 --> 00:51:04.366]  Met him like seven, eight years ago, but been good friends for many years now.
[00:51:05.346 --> 00:51:07.347]  And it just feels good.
[00:51:07.587 --> 00:51:11.267]  You know, it's like, feels like family getting him back on.
[00:51:11.287 --> 00:51:13.708]  A lot of stuff behind the scenes, why he couldn't come on.
[00:51:14.522 --> 00:51:25.649]  And he was starting to really, if you just joined us as we start hour two, get into blue blood Republicans who are leftist or America haters and have their problems and are mentally ill.
[00:51:26.465 --> 00:51:29.447]  But blue-blood Republicans are a disgusting lot as well.
[00:51:29.947 --> 00:51:32.349]  They just think everything's okay.
[00:51:32.409 --> 00:51:33.490]  They're insulated.
[00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.431]  They're living off old family money.
[00:51:35.932 --> 00:51:41.315]  And if they think Trump's got this, and they don't realize how dangerous things are, they are living on another planet.
[00:51:41.335 --> 00:51:44.898]  So Roger, your emergency message to the Country Club Republicans.
[00:51:46.025 --> 00:51:48.226]  It's been very disturbing over the last couple of days.
[00:51:48.286 --> 00:51:52.328]  I've seen these fake stories about how Trump's heart is really not in it.
[00:51:52.368 --> 00:51:54.109]  He's not going to fight for reelection.
[00:51:54.149 --> 00:51:56.430]  He's thinking about heading for the tall grass.
[00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:57.570]  That's not the Trump I know.
[00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:59.091]  Trump I know is a fighter.
[00:51:59.431 --> 00:52:00.692]  Trump I know is a brawler.
[00:52:00.792 --> 00:52:03.813]  The Trump I know will never leave his country in the lurch.
[00:52:04.233 --> 00:52:13.837]  But I also know that there are members of the Trump campaign staff at the lower levels who are out shopping a memoir, a tell-all memoir, because they're already assuming his defeat.
[00:52:13.917 --> 00:52:15.918]  He's not going to lose, he's going to win.
[00:52:16.298 --> 00:52:21.781]  He's going to win if every one of us recognizes the inherent danger of his loss.
[00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:24.262]  He's the only thing that stands between us
[00:52:25.062 --> 00:52:25.943]  And globalism.
[00:52:25.983 --> 00:52:30.667]  He's the only thing that stands between us and a total socialist takeover of America.
[00:52:31.027 --> 00:52:35.991]  This may well be our last presidential election if he does not win.
[00:52:36.231 --> 00:52:37.392]  I really believe that.
[00:52:38.032 --> 00:52:41.135]  And my confidence in him has never been shaken.
[00:52:41.175 --> 00:52:42.656]  Look, Alex, this is really clear.
[00:52:43.537 --> 00:52:52.684]  On July 24th, 2019, the prosecutors working for Mueller approached one of my lawyers to propose a deal.
[00:52:54.076 --> 00:52:55.777]  And they were very careful in their wording.
[00:52:55.897 --> 00:52:58.897]  They said, it's time for your client to confess.
[00:52:59.518 --> 00:53:01.818]  It's time for your client to come clean.
[00:53:02.338 --> 00:53:10.921]  It's time for your client to re-remember these phone calls we have a record of between he and candidate Trump in 2016.
[00:53:11.281 --> 00:53:20.243]  And if he's prepared to tell the truth, which is that these phone calls pertain to coordinating the timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures and Russia.
[00:53:20.703 --> 00:53:24.785]  Well, we might be willing to propose to the judge that he serve no time.
[00:53:25.505 --> 00:53:27.786]  In other words, they wanted me to lie.
[00:53:28.206 --> 00:53:36.970]  They put me under enormous financial and legal pressure to bear false witness against the president, and I refused to do this.
[00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:38.591]  I can document this.
[00:53:39.351 --> 00:53:43.113]  It is something that I have never regretted, not for a minute.
[00:53:44.014 --> 00:53:58.846]  Staring into the abyss, looking at 40 months in jail and what is in fact a de facto death sentence right now, I still say to you, I regret nothing that I did during the 2016 election because I didn't do anything wrong.
[00:53:59.626 --> 00:54:06.532]  In her tongue lashing at me sentence, the judge said that I was a belligerent.
[00:54:07.372 --> 00:54:09.734]  Let me define that for you.
[00:54:09.754 --> 00:54:11.455]  That means I wouldn't plead guilty.
[00:54:11.836 --> 00:54:18.480]  That means I wouldn't take responsibility for a crime I did not commit, which is my right as an American.
[00:54:18.761 --> 00:54:25.946]  And particularly, I would not roll over on the President of the United States like Michael Cohen and tell them what they wanted to hear.
[00:54:26.406 --> 00:54:29.228]  This was weeks before the Mueller report came out.
[00:54:29.348 --> 00:54:32.971]  It was clear to me they had no evidence of Russian collusion.
[00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:47.883]  But because the president had correctly and honestly said in the written answers to the Mueller interrogatory, the written questions, that he and I never discussed WikiLeaks, they thought that they could trip him up by getting me to say otherwise.
[00:54:48.063 --> 00:54:49.604]  And I refused.
[00:54:49.964 --> 00:55:01.198]  The accounts of Rick Gates at my trial, the accounts of Michael Cohen before the two Senate committees and the House Oversight Committee are uncorroborated lies.
[00:55:01.298 --> 00:55:08.327]  Well that's right and Trump's talked about the treason and the illegality and the Russiagate was a fraud and Ukrainegate was a fraud and now all this is a fraud.
[00:55:08.928 --> 00:55:13.353]  And that's really the problem, is they never get in trouble, so they just keep doing it over and over again.
[00:55:13.393 --> 00:55:16.856]  You know, you know the inside baseball, I can't talk about it on air because I had agreements I wouldn't.
[00:55:17.377 --> 00:55:21.461]  They've approached me and said, come out against Trump, the Second Amendment will drop the lawsuits.
[00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:24.484]  You know, they've come out and said, hey, a big billionaire, well-known guy.
[00:55:24.904 --> 00:55:27.666]  He wants to give you a First Amendment foundation and give you money.
[00:55:28.126 --> 00:55:29.627]  Instead of lawsuits, we'll give you money.
[00:55:29.667 --> 00:55:31.528]  Or, oh, we won't indict you.
[00:55:31.648 --> 00:55:33.429]  You know, you need to really come out against Trump.
[00:55:33.469 --> 00:55:38.191]  I mean, this is a major squeeze against the American people by the deep state.
[00:55:38.812 --> 00:55:45.315]  And the fact that now, almost four years in, they can't execute shows to their minions they're losing power.
[00:55:45.696 --> 00:55:49.598]  But that's what's scary is now they're really getting desperate, Roger.
[00:55:50.981 --> 00:55:53.363]  Well, that's why they want me off the battlefield for 2020.
[00:55:54.064 --> 00:55:56.706]  That's what I think most of this is really about.
[00:55:56.947 --> 00:55:58.188]  That's my closing thing.
[00:55:58.248 --> 00:55:59.269]  Get you off the battlefield.
[00:55:59.289 --> 00:55:59.889]  Talk about that.
[00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:08.838]  How beautiful if you got clemency next week, or a pardon, and instead of running from you, Trump brought you in as a spokesperson or brought you in as an advisor.
[00:56:09.482 --> 00:56:11.363]  The president has never run for mayor.
[00:56:11.443 --> 00:56:13.183]  Look at his history of tweets.
[00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:14.124]  No, no, he hasn't.
[00:56:14.164 --> 00:56:14.884]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:56:14.924 --> 00:56:16.444]  He said, Roger, nothing wrong.
[00:56:16.725 --> 00:56:18.365]  Roger has nothing to worry about.
[00:56:18.665 --> 00:56:26.928]  Roger's been... I'm saying, pardon you, and then just bring you in front and center in press conferences.
[00:56:26.968 --> 00:56:28.609]  That would be so powerful.
[00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:33.131]  Well, but let me be very clear, I'm not looking for a job in this campaign entourage.
[00:56:33.271 --> 00:56:48.781]  I think what I did in 2016, by making African Americans aware of the existence of Danny Williams, who was on this show, who is in fact the illegitimate son of Bill Clinton, who was cut off by Hillary, not by Bill.
[00:56:50.222 --> 00:57:00.411]  By revealing Bill Clinton's serial sexual assaults against multiple women, but far more importantly, the role Hillary played in bullying and intimidating and threatening those women.
[00:57:00.531 --> 00:57:06.476]  That's right, you didn't do the dirty work, you did the dangerous work nobody else would do, and we did it as well, and the listeners did it.
[00:57:06.536 --> 00:57:09.218]  You exposed what was documented reality.
[00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:14.383]  And that's exactly, so you're saying, make you a free agent, and you'll get back in the fight.
[00:57:15.248 --> 00:57:22.571]  I will do everything I possibly can within the bounds of the law to re-elect this president as I did four years ago.
[00:57:23.111 --> 00:57:25.352]  They know that I'm a scrapper and a fighter.
[00:57:25.372 --> 00:57:30.234]  I'm tired of reading Roger Stone, self-described dirty trickster.
[00:57:30.314 --> 00:57:32.134]  Roger Stone, self-proclaimed.
[00:57:32.154 --> 00:57:34.575]  I have never called myself that.
[00:57:34.715 --> 00:57:36.196]  I have never proclaimed myself that.
[00:57:36.576 --> 00:57:40.317]  I have acknowledged that Democrats, who I have beaten, have called me that.
[00:57:40.577 --> 00:57:41.938]  But now it's ubiquitous.
[00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:43.578]  Now it's all over.
[00:57:43.598 --> 00:57:44.078]  I did get the L.A.
[00:57:44.098 --> 00:57:44.218]  Times.
[00:57:44.238 --> 00:57:48.760]  Well, Roger, it's like when they say, Jones, who admits he's an actor and admits he's fake.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.060]  Million dollars you have that.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:50.720]  I never said that.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.700]  I'm totally real.
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:53.021]  Have I been in a few movies?
[00:57:53.061 --> 00:57:53.921]  Have I done acting?
[00:57:53.961 --> 00:57:54.181]  Yes.
[00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:56.441]  That's like saying, have I played croquet?
[00:57:56.862 --> 00:57:58.082]  But I'm not a croquet player.
[00:57:58.102 --> 00:57:59.282]  Have I played basketball?
[00:57:59.302 --> 00:58:00.442]  Yeah, I'm not a basketball player.
[00:58:00.802 --> 00:58:01.983]  Have I shot guns?
[00:58:02.023 --> 00:58:03.263]  Yeah, but I'm not an Olympic marksman.
[00:58:03.523 --> 00:58:06.944]  The idea that I'm an actor, you're a fraud, it's a fraud.
[00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:08.635]  I agree.
[00:58:08.715 --> 00:58:15.199]  So one more time, sign the petition at FreeRogerStone.com.
[00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:21.922]  Part of our campaign to make sure the President is aware that, you know, I have basically 14 days.
[00:58:22.803 --> 00:58:31.207]  14 days from now I will have to report to a prison in rural Georgia and as I've said, I believe it is a death sentence.
[00:58:31.367 --> 00:58:33.829]  I believe it is the end of the line.
[00:58:34.489 --> 00:58:36.950]  And I'm praying fervently... Well, not just from COVID.
[00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:43.913]  I mean, they'll try to Epstein you, and I know they'll put you in solitary confinement like Manafort, and we don't want to put you in the clutches of these guys.
[00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:49.876]  Well, let's not get my wife more upset than she already is, but I recognize that's a very real danger.
[00:58:50.556 --> 00:58:55.278]  No matter what, there's no circumstance whatsoever in which I will ever betray this president.
[00:58:55.679 --> 00:58:58.160]  I have great affection for him and for his family.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.660]  And you'll never commit suicide.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.421]  And you'll never commit... Say it.
[00:59:01.921 --> 00:59:02.742]  You'll never commit suicide.
[00:59:03.502 --> 00:59:07.825]  No, if they ever tell you Stone killed himself, you will know that somehow the Clintons are involved.
[00:59:07.925 --> 00:59:08.866]  I will never do that.
[00:59:09.866 --> 00:59:12.428]  As a Christian, it is prohibited.
[00:59:12.588 --> 00:59:15.390]  I would never, under any circumstances, do that.
[00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:20.594]  So if they come back to you and tell you, oh, he was despondent, he killed himself, that will never happen.
[00:59:21.434 --> 00:59:25.016]  But let's get the statement clear without me interrupting, because number one, you're a fighter.
[00:59:25.097 --> 00:59:26.297]  You crave the fight.
[00:59:26.337 --> 00:59:27.078]  You don't look for it.
[00:59:27.478 --> 00:59:28.179]  Say a statement.
[00:59:28.459 --> 00:59:33.102]  Roger Stone, will you kill yourself in prison if they lock you up as a political prisoner?
[00:59:33.742 --> 00:59:36.525]  Alex, there's no circumstances under which I will do that.
[00:59:36.645 --> 00:59:37.726]  God will protect me.
[00:59:37.906 --> 00:59:41.489]  I believe that at the end of the day, justice will be done in my case.
[00:59:41.669 --> 00:59:43.090]  I am praying to this president.
[00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:47.174]  I'm praying, more importantly, to God to protect me, because I know he will.
[00:59:47.614 --> 00:59:51.598]  I've learned it in the Bible, and it has been solace.
[00:59:51.998 --> 00:59:52.899]  It has been strength.
[00:59:53.339 --> 00:59:55.661]  It has given me the fortitude to continue the fight.
[00:59:56.942 --> 00:59:58.343]  I could not have done it any other way.
[01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:02.307]  Well, Roger, we salute you.
[01:00:02.327 --> 01:00:08.054]  Can you just say with all of us here, in the name of Jesus Christ, we beg for justice with Roger Stone.
[01:00:08.774 --> 01:00:10.096]  Please, Jesus, protect me.
[01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:11.882]  Absolutely.
[01:00:11.922 --> 01:00:23.791]  In the name of Jesus Christ Almighty, in the name of our Savior and Lord, I walk with Him and I ask that He protect me and my family in these final days of my epic struggle for freedom.
[01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:27.494]  In the name of Jesus, Amen, all of us together for Roger Stone.
[01:00:27.734 --> 01:00:28.514]  We love you, Roger.
[01:00:28.534 --> 01:00:29.375]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:00:29.675 --> 01:00:30.296]  We salute you.
[01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:31.356]  Thank you for so much time.
[01:00:31.657 --> 01:00:33.378]  We are all Roger Stone right now, folks.
[01:00:33.418 --> 01:00:34.299]  Pray for Roger Stone.
[01:00:34.519 --> 01:00:35.720]  They want to make him a political prisoner.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.420]  We won't let it happen.
[01:00:38.021 --> 01:00:39.623]  This country is fighting for its life.
[01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:43.292]  And there's so many giant things breaking, it makes my head spin.
[01:00:43.332 --> 01:00:46.294]  Now, I have a thousand ways to start this segment.
[01:00:47.635 --> 01:00:51.798]  And incredible articles, videos, that we haven't even hit, that are super entertaining and interesting.
[01:00:52.078 --> 01:00:53.159]  I probably won't get to any of it.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.321]  Because the core issues are what matters.
[01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:57.282]  And the understanding of that.
[01:00:57.843 --> 01:01:00.425]  So, I've told this story probably 3,000 times.
[01:01:00.485 --> 01:01:02.266]  I say, I start a lot of the shows with this.
[01:01:03.887 --> 01:01:08.631]  26 years ago on radio and TV, I might have never said the first few years, this is the biggest show I ever did.
[01:01:09.721 --> 01:01:12.302]  Then about 15 years ago, maybe once a year, I'd say biggest show ever.
[01:01:13.322 --> 01:01:19.284]  And then as time goes on, it's like every month, and then every week, and then every day, it's the quickening, it's the compounding.
[01:01:20.805 --> 01:01:27.627]  Now, there is more news breaking today of just over-the-top nature than has broken the last month.
[01:01:28.747 --> 01:01:38.671]  And that's the thing about the quickening, is it's gonna get more insane, it's gonna get more crazy, it's gonna get more out of control, and it's all just going to come out in the open
[01:01:39.602 --> 01:01:43.685]  But here's the secret, the key, the core, the Rosetta Stone, the skeleton key.
[01:01:45.386 --> 01:02:03.020]  By the time we fully wake up, the globalists will be in AI robot control, we'll be domesticated, and we're going to have the total choice of joining Satan and pedophilia and world government and the end of our species to just live a few more years or we have to fight it and most of us die.
[01:02:05.171 --> 01:02:08.293]  And so I've never really been super scared to die.
[01:02:08.313 --> 01:02:09.813]  I mean, I'm willing to do what has to be done.
[01:02:10.054 --> 01:02:11.334]  I've gone through a lot of stuff in my life.
[01:02:11.835 --> 01:02:16.397]  I realized that all those persecution things I went through was God preparing me so I could handle this at this point.
[01:02:17.578 --> 01:02:19.058]  I'm very thankful for the persecution now.
[01:02:19.078 --> 01:02:21.039]  I thank God for everything.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.000]  Every time I got too bad, I couldn't take it.
[01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:23.801]  God came in.
[01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:24.321]  It was crazy.
[01:02:25.562 --> 01:02:26.542]  It's been quite a journey now.
[01:02:27.063 --> 01:02:28.083]  In hindsight, it's 2020.
[01:02:28.123 --> 01:02:29.964]  I can see God's hand on me the whole time.
[01:02:32.405 --> 01:02:33.506]  God's hands on you as well.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:50.890]  We should really mourn for the people that have been turned over to evil and who were cut off from God because it's a spiritual choice they're making and they're already in a bad place and they're going to go to a much, much worse place.
[01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:56.614]  And there's a big letter out from a famous environmentalist today that if I have time I'll get to.
[01:02:56.654 --> 01:03:03.180]  David Knight covered it at the end of his broadcast today at about 10.50 or so.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:03.800]  Powerful.
[01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:05.462]  Hopefully they'll put it out as a report.
[01:03:07.762 --> 01:03:16.713]  And this fellow bought into it all, did it all, you know, well-known author, well-known person that believed it, went to the Amazon to help people, traveled all over, chained himself to bulldozers.
[01:03:18.188 --> 01:03:41.677]  And he saw how mentally ill his daughter was and suicidal and having guilt about herself and how it was all a fraud what he'd been taught and how they're really actually hurting the real environment with this fake environmental movement saying heat is the problem and carbon dioxide is the problem, genetic engineering, nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors out of control, gene splicing, that's the threat to everybody and the planet.
[01:03:43.268 --> 01:03:44.549]  It's a very powerful article.
[01:03:44.609 --> 01:03:45.449]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:46.650]  In fact, I had it here in the stack.
[01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:47.530]  I was looking for it during the break.
[01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:49.671]  If you guys could reprint that for me, it'd be great.
[01:03:49.691 --> 01:03:51.312]  But there's so many hundreds of articles.
[01:03:51.352 --> 01:03:55.854]  By the time I read over them, I just put them in the stacks and can't find them, even though I try to organize all this.
[01:03:59.316 --> 01:04:12.382]  But I could do a whole show just on this well-known individual just finally coming to Jesus and going, man, this is an anti-human system to kill everybody, and it's depressing, and it's a lie, and it's about how we suck, and we don't suck!
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:17.561]  We're not going to decide to just roll over to die because a bunch of Satanists want control.
[01:04:18.801 --> 01:04:22.382]  We're not perfect, but we're not going to be directed by a bunch of Satanists.
[01:04:23.002 --> 01:04:39.186]  And then, I already knew this, but right before the broadcast started, they come in and they give me a mainstream German newspaper article about 30,000 people under investigation for a powerful governmental level pedophile ring in Germany.
[01:04:42.005 --> 01:04:46.187]  Now remember the psychiatrist in Berlin running thousands of kids to people over 30 years.
[01:04:47.168 --> 01:04:56.872]  And now with that bust, it expanded out with the list to where the people now adults say the judges and the politicians and the police chiefs were coming.
[01:04:59.494 --> 01:05:07.838]  So when you see one of these leftist globalist politicians, they're either a pedophile or worse, or they've been abused and have been programmed.
[01:05:09.144 --> 01:05:16.066]  When I say programmed, I mean, Macron was a sex object on record when he was 12 years old at satanic parties.
[01:05:18.107 --> 01:05:21.348]  Macron has obviously been programmed, electroshock, you name it.
[01:05:22.208 --> 01:05:23.589]  You talk about MKUltra, he's in.
[01:05:26.469 --> 01:05:31.131]  These groups groom and prepare people for control so they know they've got full control of them.
[01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:37.402]  Well, the New World Order's got its programming regimen.
[01:05:37.422 --> 01:05:38.182]  God's got his.
[01:05:38.962 --> 01:05:41.782]  So while the enemy's building their soldiers, God's building his.
[01:05:42.603 --> 01:05:44.183]  Building you, which you went through in your life.
[01:05:44.943 --> 01:05:53.505]  So those persecutions and bad things that happened to you, when you fought back against them, and even if you didn't overcome them, if you fought against them, you became stronger, not weaker.
[01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:55.325]  Own your persecution.
[01:05:56.145 --> 01:05:58.266]  Own when you've been outnumbered.
[01:05:58.446 --> 01:05:58.746]  Own it!
[01:05:59.226 --> 01:06:00.226]  That's the power!
[01:06:01.929 --> 01:06:02.989]  That's what makes you strong.
[01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:06.390]  Not saying I'm a victim and rolling over and pissing all over yourself.
[01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:08.950]  Like these videos coming in of this latest Karen video.
[01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:09.971]  I forgot to tell you guys to get it.
[01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:10.811]  Go ask McBreen.
[01:06:10.831 --> 01:06:11.131]  He's got it.
[01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:13.651]  This woman flips this guy off and cuts him off.
[01:06:13.671 --> 01:06:14.992]  She pulls over and goes, Lenny, why are you being mean?
[01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:18.692]  She starts going, a black person.
[01:06:18.732 --> 01:06:19.632]  Don't hurt me.
[01:06:19.812 --> 01:06:20.453]  She's a liberal.
[01:06:21.473 --> 01:06:23.233]  And she's like covering her eyes just like crying.
[01:06:23.793 --> 01:06:25.734]  And this video, this white dude, the black dude hits him.
[01:06:25.754 --> 01:06:27.234]  He falls down and starts pissing on himself.
[01:06:28.697 --> 01:06:31.978]  The brainwashed racist black guy's got problems, but at least he thinks he's doing something.
[01:06:32.358 --> 01:06:39.839]  The person that pisses on themselves and gets on the ground and begs like a baby is the real enemy.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.621]  Let me tell all the limp-wristed people, I don't mean you're gay, I mean people that are into being weak.
[01:06:49.481 --> 01:06:51.802]  Folks that are predators look for somebody like you.
[01:06:55.575 --> 01:06:59.618]  You know, I've had a couple big predators before come across me and try to shake me down.
[01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:01.700]  And they can just tell, it's not going to be easy.
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.401]  And I just tell them, look, let's just go ahead.
[01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:04.482]  Let's start dying.
[01:07:04.682 --> 01:07:05.442]  They always go away.
[01:07:06.343 --> 01:07:10.666]  Because they're going to go on to an easier subject because they know I'm not bluffing.
[01:07:10.906 --> 01:07:12.087]  I'm ready to kill people.
[01:07:12.548 --> 01:07:17.111]  And they might win, but they're going to fight somebody that is going to hurt them really bad.
[01:07:17.131 --> 01:07:20.654]  Because I kick like a mule and I bite like a crocodile.
[01:07:21.094 --> 01:07:22.055]  And I bite people too.
[01:07:23.356 --> 01:07:26.379]  You get me down, I'll start biting big-ass chunks out of you.
[01:07:26.819 --> 01:07:27.540]  See how you like that?
[01:07:28.481 --> 01:07:29.042]  Big chunks.
[01:07:30.563 --> 01:07:32.365]  See, most people have a governor where they can't chomp down.
[01:07:32.485 --> 01:07:36.950]  I've bitten chunks out of people who had me down the size of two ounces of meat.
[01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:42.475]  You don't think the biggest, roughest guy gets off my back when I'm on the ground when I chomp into his leg?
[01:07:43.516 --> 01:07:44.677]  I've done it many times.
[01:07:45.754 --> 01:07:47.396]  I'll bite right through your jeans!
[01:07:47.956 --> 01:07:52.240]  I'll tear a big-ass bloody wad out of your leg, because I'm not dead!
[01:07:52.921 --> 01:07:54.742]  And I'm not bowing down!
[01:07:55.323 --> 01:07:58.405]  And I got the spirit of life in me, and I'm spreading it.
[01:07:59.687 --> 01:08:00.928]  I'm proud of being a human.
[01:08:01.348 --> 01:08:04.231]  And I'm proud of all you that breed, that have red blood.
[01:08:04.851 --> 01:08:07.654]  And I'm here to tell you, we're gonna get us the globalists.
[01:08:07.674 --> 01:08:10.236]  You look at that chicken-neck maggot, Bill Gates.
[01:08:10.456 --> 01:08:11.077]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:16.169]  He wants power over you because he's weak.
[01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:19.050]  The big pedophile news broke.
[01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.551]  The huge news of COVID being a total hoax just broke.
[01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:23.091]  Look at that maggot.
[01:08:24.852 --> 01:08:25.572]  Little snake.
[01:08:28.132 --> 01:08:38.855]  All right, I'm gonna settle down, but we have this galactic level, 30,000 pedophiles in the German government, mainstream news, all exposed.
[01:08:39.975 --> 01:08:41.976]  Their cult is inches from being destroyed.
[01:08:42.156 --> 01:08:42.656]  Praise God.
[01:08:42.676 --> 01:08:43.156]  We'll be right back.
[01:08:45.686 --> 01:08:48.447]  It has no more control over itself than the man on the moon.
[01:08:50.008 --> 01:08:57.432]  Once its trajectory has been chosen and once it's been loosed, you can only go with your destiny or deny it.
[01:09:01.234 --> 01:09:02.394]  Let your children play.
[01:09:02.414 --> 01:09:07.277]  Because if you give the globalists a ride, you're gonna die.
[01:09:10.719 --> 01:09:11.019]  Alright.
[01:09:12.469 --> 01:09:20.573]  I had intended to do the whole show last night on the COVID-19 hoax coming down because that's the key to stopping world depression.
[01:09:20.873 --> 01:09:22.194]  Hundreds of millions starving to death.
[01:09:23.474 --> 01:09:25.655]  But I don't just say that like we're superheroes fighting it.
[01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:27.536]  It totally freaks me out.
[01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:32.999]  I have nightmares over the fact this is a global depopulation operation and that we're not stopping.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.600]  You talk about karma.
[01:09:36.561 --> 01:09:37.661]  You talk about reap what you sow.
[01:09:37.961 --> 01:09:38.842]  We know this.
[01:09:39.929 --> 01:09:53.474]  It's one thing to be evil and not care or be part of it, but to know it and not do enough to stop it or die trying, if I get measured by God as not doing enough, I mean, I'm guilty.
[01:09:54.975 --> 01:10:01.137]  So I shake, not at the New World Order, but I shake in God's presence that
[01:10:05.455 --> 01:10:08.196]  I haven't found the words, or the information, or all of it.
[01:10:08.256 --> 01:10:08.957]  It's all public.
[01:10:09.337 --> 01:10:09.817]  Stop this!
[01:10:09.877 --> 01:10:11.058]  It's a damn nightmare!
[01:10:11.078 --> 01:10:20.762]  So I shouldn't drift off into fantasies about slitting the globalist's throat.
[01:10:20.882 --> 01:10:23.883]  I should realize that our weakness has allowed them to do this.
[01:10:24.003 --> 01:10:25.444]  We are the ones that have to get strong.
[01:10:25.804 --> 01:10:26.445]  We're the problem.
[01:10:26.985 --> 01:10:27.505]  I'm the problem.
[01:10:27.925 --> 01:10:28.486]  You're the problem.
[01:10:28.666 --> 01:10:29.506]  Let's be honest about it.
[01:10:32.747 --> 01:10:33.468]  And I was intending
[01:10:34.195 --> 01:10:37.198]  To cover that, and then Roger was ready to do this big interview, so we did that.
[01:10:37.218 --> 01:10:37.918]  That was powerful.
[01:10:38.619 --> 01:10:39.960]  And DrugsReport.com, link to it.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:40.861]  It's important.
[01:10:41.381 --> 01:10:44.564]  She's a political prisoner, and repudiating the whole Russiagate lie is important.
[01:10:46.564 --> 01:11:05.891]  But then right before the show, I saw these articles, and I already knew the backstory, but to see it in Bild and Der Spiegel and DW, and on the major national German TV, that 30,000 people, most of them government officials and bureaucrats in child protective services, are under investigation for pedophilia.
[01:11:06.211 --> 01:11:08.592]  I mean, actually keeping children, having sex with them.
[01:11:16.428 --> 01:11:17.789]  Look at that, BBC News.
[01:11:18.549 --> 01:11:20.110]  BBC's run by pedophiles, on record.
[01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:24.092]  Germany investigates 30,000 suspects over pedophile network.
[01:11:25.412 --> 01:11:36.858]  As I told you two weeks ago, breathlessly, that comes out of the DW.com, Berlin authorities place children with pedophiles for 30 years, thousands of them per city.
[01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:42.541]  And they would run a brothel for sex with children as young as five.
[01:11:44.568 --> 01:11:46.971]  So that government officials can come screw children.
[01:11:48.973 --> 01:11:50.855]  It's not enough to just talk about these people.
[01:11:51.335 --> 01:11:57.983]  If they don't go to prison or get executed, what are we gonna do?
[01:11:58.003 --> 01:11:59.965]  I mean, it's really reached that point, hasn't it?
[01:12:03.729 --> 01:12:04.370]  They're vampires.
[01:12:05.598 --> 01:12:10.799]  And if you read Bram Stoker's Dracula, that's actually based on the religion of the globalists.
[01:12:10.819 --> 01:12:29.823]  There's not real vampires that live forever, but there's a bloodline that they believe lives forever, that goes back to Transylvania, that went through German royalty that became the British royalty, and the House of Dracula, Count Dracula, Vlad the Impaler, and they do drink blood, and they do have sex with children, and what does Dracula at the beginning of Bram Stoker's Dracula do?
[01:12:30.323 --> 01:12:32.123]  He's got babies delivered to him,
[01:12:32.503 --> 01:12:36.728]  That have been kidnapped for his brides to drink their blood.
[01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.672]  What do you think a black Sabbath is?
[01:12:42.013 --> 01:12:43.835]  You drink a blood, a baby's blood.
[01:12:45.076 --> 01:12:46.518]  You have a sex orgy and it's blood.
[01:12:46.658 --> 01:12:48.360]  I mean, I don't want to tell you about this type of stuff.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.562]  This is mainline research.
[01:12:50.582 --> 01:12:51.223]  This is not debated.
[01:12:54.124 --> 01:12:57.745]  And you need to understand, folks, that they're not just having sex with kids.
[01:12:57.785 --> 01:12:58.925]  They're capping them.
[01:12:59.045 --> 01:13:03.526]  And they're torturing the living hell out of them before they die.
[01:13:03.926 --> 01:13:08.507]  Sometimes they can suck their blood with lances cutting into them for up to two days.
[01:13:12.747 --> 01:13:15.868]  And they love the children to beg and cry and scream for mommy.
[01:13:15.988 --> 01:13:22.369]  And I don't want to tell you about all this, but these people need killing, don't they?
[01:13:24.963 --> 01:13:25.443]  And they will.
[01:13:28.525 --> 01:13:31.927]  But if we go off half-cocked, they'll be the victim and get away with it.
[01:13:31.967 --> 01:13:40.512]  We have to walk softly, carry a big stick, be as wise as a serpent and peaceful as a dove, until God delivers judgment.
[01:13:40.592 --> 01:13:44.394]  And you'll know when that moment is, and we will be the implements of the judgment.
[01:13:44.794 --> 01:13:51.598]  God's hand picks us up like the dagger and thrusts it into the enemy's throat, but we do not direct it.
[01:13:51.658 --> 01:13:53.879]  And you'll know, you'll know the time.
[01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:03.850]  And when the time comes, it's important not to torture these people.
[01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:06.491]  You dispatch them like you dispatch a rattlesnake.
[01:14:07.472 --> 01:14:09.313]  I hate to put it on a rattlesnake or a cockroach.
[01:14:09.633 --> 01:14:10.353]  You step on them.
[01:14:11.894 --> 01:14:12.534]  Then you move on.
[01:14:14.235 --> 01:14:15.095]  But they will die.
[01:14:22.299 --> 01:14:23.519]  But think about the quickening.
[01:14:24.399 --> 01:14:25.180]  There is so much
[01:14:26.852 --> 01:14:31.594]  Galactic news happening, and it's gonna get crazier tomorrow, and crazier the next day.
[01:14:31.614 --> 01:14:34.135]  So all I can tell you is get right with God.
[01:14:36.036 --> 01:14:39.597]  DW.com, Berlin authorities place children with pedophiles for 30 years.
[01:14:40.597 --> 01:14:43.139]  German authorities place homeless children with known pedophiles.
[01:14:43.159 --> 01:14:44.879]  They call them homeless, they took them to their Christian families.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:54.123]  German investigation, DW.com, 30,000 potential suspects in pedophile probe nationwide.
[01:14:56.854 --> 01:14:59.396]  And you read deeper, government-directed.
[01:15:02.477 --> 01:15:14.324]  Pedophiles might be one-tenth of one percent, but they get power, and they bring their people in, and finally, they bring all their people in, and they use litmus tests, political correctness, to decide who can be in and who can be out.
[01:15:14.364 --> 01:15:15.105]  That's just their cover.
[01:15:15.365 --> 01:15:21.749]  But behind the scenes, you take one look, I mean, everybody knows, without saying names of people, but when you look at the
[01:15:22.702 --> 01:15:24.283]  Well, let's just say the mayor of New York.
[01:15:24.383 --> 01:15:25.824]  I mean, let him keep your kids.
[01:15:25.864 --> 01:15:27.726]  I mean, that is a big fat demon right there.
[01:15:27.886 --> 01:15:28.887]  Looks just like Sandusky.
[01:15:29.127 --> 01:15:30.388]  They all look like Sandusky.
[01:15:30.888 --> 01:15:32.049]  Guys, put Sandusky on screen.
[01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:34.951]  They all got that zombie look.
[01:15:34.971 --> 01:15:35.792]  They're gone, man.
[01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:36.472]  Those are ghouls.
[01:15:37.513 --> 01:15:43.497]  But remember, a Sandusky is nothing but a Renfield.
[01:15:45.259 --> 01:15:48.301]  They deliver the children to the Dracula's.
[01:15:51.328 --> 01:15:53.329]  And I'm just going to tell you what a Dracula looks like.
[01:15:53.369 --> 01:15:54.390]  I'm not saying he's one.
[01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:56.631]  I'm just going to tell you what a Dracula looks like.
[01:15:57.451 --> 01:16:00.713]  Renfields all have that enslaved, little ferret, rat-like look.
[01:16:01.074 --> 01:16:02.134]  Black, white, old, young.
[01:16:02.154 --> 01:16:02.794]  They look like that.
[01:16:04.355 --> 01:16:06.457]  Draculas look like Sacha Baron Cohen.
[01:16:11.459 --> 01:16:15.542]  When you look at him at the ADL, or you look at... Hitler looks like a Dracula.
[01:16:16.182 --> 01:16:17.403]  Stalin looked like a Dracula.
[01:16:17.463 --> 01:16:18.423]  Lenin was a Dracula.
[01:16:18.483 --> 01:16:19.344]  Mao was a Dracula.
[01:16:20.384 --> 01:16:21.624]  They got that look, man.
[01:16:22.205 --> 01:16:23.345]  That's a predator right there.
[01:16:23.665 --> 01:16:25.206]  Now, he may not want your kids.
[01:16:25.566 --> 01:16:27.026]  He just wants your speech and your freedom.
[01:16:27.246 --> 01:16:28.207]  Wants to put you in a prison.
[01:16:29.307 --> 01:16:33.949]  But when you look at him, you better get a chill down your spine because he's sworn to destroy you and your family.
[01:16:43.752 --> 01:16:44.473]  Now, remember that.
[01:16:46.854 --> 01:16:47.994]  You gonna bow down to Dracula?
[01:16:50.247 --> 01:16:51.448]  What's Dracula not like?
[01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:57.312]  Dracula doesn't like the light of day, doesn't like truth, doesn't like God, doesn't like being exposed.
[01:16:58.053 --> 01:16:59.234]  What else does Dracula not like?
[01:16:59.554 --> 01:17:00.355]  Healthy things.
[01:17:00.555 --> 01:17:01.155]  Nutrients.
[01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:05.419]  All the old lifetales are an archetype.
[01:17:05.719 --> 01:17:06.179]  Garlic.
[01:17:06.459 --> 01:17:07.200]  What's good for your body?
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:07.940]  What's good for your blood?
[01:17:07.961 --> 01:17:08.941]  What's good for everything, buddy?
[01:17:10.522 --> 01:17:11.383]  What else does he not like?
[01:17:11.403 --> 01:17:13.665]  Doesn't like Christianity, the cross, Christ, sacrifice.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.640]  Holiness, blessing, praying.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.401]  Yeah, look at John D. Rockefeller.
[01:17:19.821 --> 01:17:23.101]  I mean, if that ain't Nosferatu, baby, what ain't?
[01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:24.141]  What is?
[01:17:25.822 --> 01:17:28.762]  I'm gonna move out of that story, though, and get to the big one that can bring down the enemy.
[01:17:28.782 --> 01:17:33.503]  This torpedo, if loaded correctly and fired rightly, will sink the Bismarck.
[01:17:36.524 --> 01:17:38.424]  Frud, tubes one, two, and three.
[01:17:39.724 --> 01:17:43.605]  You walk into this room, you walk into reality.
[01:17:44.838 --> 01:17:53.041]  That's really what we need to do is break out of the proto-matrix, break out of the simulation they're trying to insert us into of Hollywood and our false culture.
[01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:59.044]  You know, it's very important when I said earlier, and it's really an overstatement.
[01:17:59.064 --> 01:18:00.364]  Everybody already kind of knows this, don't you?
[01:18:01.104 --> 01:18:02.665]  You know, God is the will of the universe.
[01:18:02.705 --> 01:18:03.645]  God is consciousness.
[01:18:03.665 --> 01:18:04.766]  God is the Almighty.
[01:18:05.846 --> 01:18:07.507]  And so vengeance is God's.
[01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:12.769]  But how does God deliver vengeance?
[01:18:15.148 --> 01:18:16.949]  Well, God delivers vengeance through us.
[01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:24.412]  But you've got to be real careful that you're actually following God's plan, and you'll know when it's time for vengeance.
[01:18:27.413 --> 01:18:42.539]  But if you won't engage in information warfare vengeance, then when it comes time, if ever, to execute violence, you will falter.
[01:18:44.226 --> 01:18:44.867]  You will waver.
[01:18:44.927 --> 01:18:46.328]  In fact, you won't even show up.
[01:18:51.092 --> 01:18:55.957]  A lot of people talk about how if we see you in troops we'll kill them.
[01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:57.658]  And rightfully so!
[01:18:57.678 --> 01:19:01.361]  That's an invasion of our sovereign nation!
[01:19:02.145 --> 01:19:05.346]  That's a default position, but now the flag is evil.
[01:19:05.486 --> 01:19:06.406]  America's bad.
[01:19:06.686 --> 01:19:08.027]  The UN should run our police.
[01:19:08.347 --> 01:19:11.628]  Biden's giving a press conference now, babbling like he's on another planet.
[01:19:12.368 --> 01:19:18.790]  Like he's got a rotting, dementia-addled, mad cow brain, which he does.
[01:19:22.231 --> 01:19:24.092]  He says, America needs a president.
[01:19:26.973 --> 01:19:28.193]  Well, that means we don't need you.
[01:19:32.805 --> 01:19:36.028]  Don't take his weakness as weakness of the enemy.
[01:19:36.749 --> 01:19:37.609]  He's a placeholder.
[01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:40.152]  And I know you know that, but you did hear that here two years ago.
[01:19:41.393 --> 01:19:42.614]  And now you see it's confirmed.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.120]  All right, listen.
[01:19:51.742 --> 01:19:54.524]  I get up here constantly and I'm like, this is an important article.
[01:19:54.904 --> 01:19:56.065]  That's an important article.
[01:19:56.526 --> 01:19:57.607]  This is an important video.
[01:19:59.079 --> 01:20:07.862]  And sometimes I beg and I plead to the audience to get excited about something, and rarely when I beg for something do I get it.
[01:20:08.622 --> 01:20:14.504]  So I almost get superstitious, where I just don't want to say this is super important, please promote it.
[01:20:14.804 --> 01:20:18.926]  Because when I don't promote something like it's super important, that goes to the zeitgeist.
[01:20:19.346 --> 01:20:24.768]  And a lot of times it's something that's important, but nothing compared to the stuff that I know.
[01:20:27.469 --> 01:20:29.149]  We'll devastate the globalists.
[01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:32.050]  We'll wreck their world.
[01:20:37.411 --> 01:20:45.973]  So I could sit here and break this story down, or you could go research it yourself and decide to promote it, but I'm telling you, you want to fire a torpedo to the New World Order.
[01:20:45.993 --> 01:20:47.413]  You want to sink their ship.
[01:20:48.394 --> 01:20:52.655]  You want to wreck their biggest hoax, COVID-19, that is creating a worldwide depression.
[01:20:52.855 --> 01:20:53.855]  You really want to save
[01:20:55.029 --> 01:20:57.631]  Millions of people, this is it, including your own future?
[01:20:57.651 --> 01:21:02.034]  Because for you, it just means you'll be bankrupt and might be homeless.
[01:21:02.294 --> 01:21:04.076]  For the third world, it means a bunch are going to die.
[01:21:05.877 --> 01:21:07.818]  And that's just because the globalists ain't got around to us yet.
[01:21:08.319 --> 01:21:12.061]  They're just bringing us down to third world status while they kill the third world, and then they'll get to us next.
[01:21:13.262 --> 01:21:16.164]  That's why empathy is a very selfish and good thing.
[01:21:17.986 --> 01:21:19.347]  So let's go ahead and lay this out.
[01:21:20.748 --> 01:21:23.390]  If you go to InfoWars.com or you go to NewsWars.com,
[01:21:24.264 --> 01:21:30.409]  There are articles and videos with a report, and we've got five times the previous record traffic right now.
[01:21:30.449 --> 01:21:35.393]  So thanks to DrugsReport.com linking to us, and also thanks to all the listeners promoting the links.
[01:21:35.413 --> 01:21:36.854]  You know, Roger Stone coming on today.
[01:21:38.575 --> 01:21:40.597]  And they tripled the servers again.
[01:21:40.637 --> 01:21:50.945]  We just signed an even bigger deal just this morning when we saw the traffic surge, because we've got tens of thousands of people a second hitting Bandai Video.
[01:21:50.985 --> 01:21:51.385]  It's beautiful.
[01:21:55.421 --> 01:22:07.136]  For this story, the state of Texas confirms that the feds have ordered them to falsify COVID-19 numbers at least 15 times.
[01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:10.701]  What they actually are.
[01:22:10.761 --> 01:22:14.282]  For every person with COVID, they add 15 more people.
[01:22:14.342 --> 01:22:15.303]  That's the minimum.
[01:22:15.963 --> 01:22:17.644]  They talk about adding 36 people.
[01:22:18.164 --> 01:22:19.044]  No testing, no nothing.
[01:22:19.204 --> 01:22:23.846]  They go on to say, oh by the way, we don't count somebody as COVID that's tested positive.
[01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:31.608]  You have a runny nose, or a headache, or a sore throat, any one thing, you're now COVID, and then everyone around you is COVID.
[01:22:31.848 --> 01:22:33.829]  So that one's based on a fraud too.
[01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:36.810]  Let's see how they've already gotten us used to the fraud.
[01:22:38.496 --> 01:22:45.037]  Oh, they take all these people that die of car wrecks and cancer and heart attacks and gunshot wounds on record and put them in the COVID thing.
[01:22:45.558 --> 01:22:47.618]  They take nursing home patients they've killed and put them in the thing.
[01:22:48.918 --> 01:22:54.319]  And we know there's a lot of false positive tests, and we know that people, the antibodies, they count as having it, even though that means you already are immune to it.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.301]  And it turns out this COVID-19, as the Spanish government said, has been around for years!
[01:23:01.121 --> 01:23:01.881]  You've all got it!
[01:23:03.496 --> 01:23:04.696]  That's why they chose it.
[01:23:04.876 --> 01:23:09.057]  So once, remember the Democrats keep saying, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing.
[01:23:09.157 --> 01:23:11.978]  Oh, America's behind on testing, even though we've done more than anybody else.
[01:23:12.458 --> 01:23:17.879]  So that when you get it though, you get to go home and be upset and not work and watch Netflix and go, I've got it.
[01:23:18.219 --> 01:23:19.859]  I'm asymptomatic, but I've got it.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:29.321]  And then your whole business shuts down and those outside the business shuts down, whether it's a grocery store or a warehouse or a farm or a factory or a police department.
[01:23:29.401 --> 01:23:31.682]  And we all are just shut down
[01:23:35.066 --> 01:23:41.689]  Over a test that finds anybody that's had flu or coronavirus the last decade comes up positive in the main test.
[01:23:42.749 --> 01:23:44.150]  And then we get the video.
[01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:48.872]  And then we confirm, now it's pouring in from health departments around the country, that these are the documents.
[01:23:48.912 --> 01:23:54.714]  This is Collin County, 7th most populous county in Texas, suburb of Dallas, 800,000 people live there.
[01:23:55.995 --> 01:23:58.776]  And they show the government documents and they say,
[01:24:03.336 --> 01:24:04.116]  This is insane.
[01:24:04.537 --> 01:24:06.037]  The standard is so low to have COVID.
[01:24:06.057 --> 01:24:07.278]  Anybody with a sore throat, it says.
[01:24:07.298 --> 01:24:08.278]  Anybody with a sore throat has it.
[01:24:09.859 --> 01:24:15.262]  And then if that person has it, everyone around them has it, and they go, this is going to shut everything down.
[01:24:15.302 --> 01:24:15.982]  This is a lie.
[01:24:16.522 --> 01:24:21.305]  But they go, well, it's state law, because the NIH said, here's the policies in middle of May.
[01:24:22.025 --> 01:24:25.406]  Two days later, Texas and a bunch of the states, some states have said no to this.
[01:24:25.847 --> 01:24:26.747]  They have low COVID numbers.
[01:24:29.649 --> 01:24:32.310]  Say, OK, this legislature of Texas passed this.
[01:24:33.325 --> 01:24:35.766]  The governor, in an emergency, said it was the law.
[01:24:35.986 --> 01:24:38.526]  He's been given emergency powers by the legislature, so he did that.
[01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:50.630]  And so Abbott follows the UN, follows Fauci, follows Governor Newsom, and the county judge says, this looks like BS to me, this is insane, this is going to cause a lot of problems.
[01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:53.990]  He talks to the medical director, they go, no sir, this is, you are correct.
[01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:59.272]  Anyone that has a sniffles, has a cough, or
[01:25:00.475 --> 01:25:01.816]  Test positive for COVID-19.
[01:25:02.056 --> 01:25:04.617]  We will then count everyone around them as having it as COVID cases.
[01:25:05.977 --> 01:25:08.258]  And the county judge is like, that'll cause a giant spike.
[01:25:09.919 --> 01:25:10.999]  It's a very competent meeting.
[01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:12.300]  I watched like hours of it yesterday.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.300]  I wish we had a county commission like that in Austin.
[01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:16.101]  I mean, he knows all the facts.
[01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:16.421]  They do too.
[01:25:16.441 --> 01:25:17.782]  They're like, well, it's the law.
[01:25:17.942 --> 01:25:20.703]  So it's up to the legislature and the government to figure it out.
[01:25:20.723 --> 01:25:26.025]  And he goes, okay, so if you have the snibbles or a headache or a cough, or if you test positive, everybody around you has it too.
[01:25:27.028 --> 01:25:28.249]  So the testing is fake.
[01:25:28.649 --> 01:25:29.910]  The diagnostics are fake.
[01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:37.233]  They're counting people that haven't been tested as having COVID and then all those around you have COVID.
[01:25:39.855 --> 01:25:44.778]  And this happened over a month ago and we now learn about it and then now we're confirming it's all over the country.
[01:25:44.838 --> 01:25:48.960]  These are Homeland Security documents right here where they are telling the states
[01:25:50.498 --> 01:25:52.478]  If someone has a runny nose.
[01:25:53.139 --> 01:25:55.019]  I went for a four mile hike this morning.
[01:25:55.819 --> 01:25:57.900]  There's massive dust out of Africa blowing in.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.000]  There's flowers everywhere.
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.420]  My nose was running.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.140]  I had an handkerchief.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.040]  I got allergies.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:02.440]  Big deal.
[01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:05.061]  I could go to the doctor and say, my nose is running.
[01:26:05.201 --> 01:26:06.641]  Oh my son, you have COVID.
[01:26:11.922 --> 01:26:12.823]  Think about that.
[01:26:12.863 --> 01:26:13.483]  And here's the thing.
[01:26:13.963 --> 01:26:17.163]  They've already trained us to put up with such fraud that now it's all out in the open.
[01:26:17.243 --> 01:26:17.944]  Where's this going to go?
[01:26:18.244 --> 01:26:19.524]  We have to expose it.
[01:26:22.196 --> 01:26:23.316]  We have to absolutely defeat it.
[01:26:23.336 --> 01:26:23.977]  Let me just say this.
[01:26:23.997 --> 01:26:27.498]  I've done an hour and 55 minutes of transmission and have not plugged yet.
[01:26:27.538 --> 01:26:28.698]  If we don't do this, we won't be here.
[01:26:28.978 --> 01:26:30.818]  Plus, these are great products you need to take advantage of.
[01:26:30.838 --> 01:26:32.639]  Before we start the next hour, we have a special guest.

[01:27:12.083 --> 01:27:14.623]  Storable Food, now available again, only three weeks to deliver.
[01:27:14.984 --> 01:27:17.044]  Get it while you still can, folks, for the next big crisis.
[01:27:17.464 --> 01:27:18.804]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:27:19.105 --> 01:27:24.086]  Ring in the 4th of July by supporting the Info War and getting products that enrich you and your family.
[01:27:24.366 --> 01:27:36.069]  But whatever you do, spread the word about the broadcast because the power of you getting the video at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com or Band.Video, that's an easier link to share, won't be censored as much.
[01:27:37.213 --> 01:27:46.076]  With the headline that State of Texas confirms, NIH and the Feds are caught exaggerating and faking the COVID numbers.
[01:27:46.156 --> 01:27:58.180]  That is so important to stop the depression, to stop the fraud, and to stop, more importantly, the mask and all this sort of getting you ready for forced inoculations, contact tracing with bureaucrats, and apps on your phone controlling you.
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:00.880]  This is their Chinese social score takeover.
[01:28:01.421 --> 01:28:02.761]  It's us or the COVID fraud.
[01:28:03.101 --> 01:28:04.522]  Let's destroy the hoax together.
[01:28:04.822 --> 01:28:05.302]  Stay with us.
[01:28:06.235 --> 01:28:10.758]  All right, I'm going to cover the waterfront when we come back.
[01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:16.922]  And then we've got a special guest, that lady that blew him away in Florida on the mask and the pedophile rings that's now breaking.
[01:28:17.702 --> 01:28:19.143]  She's going to be joining us here.
[01:28:20.724 --> 01:28:22.425]  But I want to go to a report here.
[01:28:26.268 --> 01:28:27.549]  Check your effing privilege.
[01:28:27.589 --> 01:28:28.609]  This is in D.C.
[01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.831]  and some New York City punk
[01:28:31.752 --> 01:28:33.854]  Tries to intimidate this woman and it looks like her son.
[01:28:33.874 --> 01:28:38.677]  And when she talks back to him, he starts crying and auntie even says, leave him alone.
[01:28:39.818 --> 01:28:40.879]  Don't be mean to him.
[01:28:40.919 --> 01:28:43.180]  And she's like, you're the one told me get out of here.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.122]  It's like this weird exercise of power.
[01:28:45.142 --> 01:28:49.765]  They always flip you off, then rush you and go, get out of here.
[01:28:50.185 --> 01:28:51.106]  Get out of here.
[01:28:51.506 --> 01:28:52.167]  Get out of here.
[01:28:52.187 --> 01:28:54.328]  And it's usually when you're walking on the street, you're like, I am getting out of here.
[01:28:54.348 --> 01:28:55.609]  And they go, get out of here.
[01:28:55.629 --> 01:28:59.652]  It's like a weird LARPing live action role play.
[01:29:03.217 --> 01:29:03.698]  We're good to go.
[01:29:20.066 --> 01:29:20.726]  Mental illness.
[01:29:20.966 --> 01:29:22.507]  And people need to stop.
[01:29:22.527 --> 01:29:26.267]  I mean, I think when Ted Cruz was in that restaurant, famously they ran him out of there a few years ago.
[01:29:26.287 --> 01:29:26.988]  He should have not done it.
[01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:29.048]  Ted Cruz retweeted this lady and said, this is how you handle it.
[01:29:29.188 --> 01:29:29.508]  I agree.
[01:29:30.128 --> 01:29:31.309]  They do this to me in a restaurant?
[01:29:31.569 --> 01:29:32.569]  Oh, I'm ruining their dinner.
[01:29:32.609 --> 01:29:33.449]  I'm coming over.
[01:29:33.469 --> 01:29:34.869]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[01:29:34.909 --> 01:29:38.170]  I should have, I'd like grab steak off their plate when that dude did this to me.
[01:29:40.111 --> 01:29:41.731]  He comes over to my table, gets in my face.
[01:29:42.871 --> 01:29:44.292]  Uh, you know, tells me to have a horrible evening.
[01:29:44.332 --> 01:29:45.772]  I just walk over to his table and ruin his evening.
[01:29:46.937 --> 01:29:47.517]  That's how it works.
[01:29:47.557 --> 01:29:48.337]  How's your steak?
[01:29:48.357 --> 01:29:49.538]  I'll eat some of that right now.
[01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.439]  Because I'm not going to bow to these bullies.
[01:29:52.599 --> 01:29:53.259]  I'm not a bully.
[01:29:53.719 --> 01:29:56.460]  But you want to start something with me, you're going to get bullied right back.
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.440]  Really bad.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:29:59.360]  Or I'm going to die trying.
[01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:05.642]  And we've got so much more coming up after that, but check your effing privilege.
[01:30:06.803 --> 01:30:09.203]  Here is this report that will come right back.
[01:30:09.283 --> 01:30:15.125]  On the other side, with that report I was talking to you guys about, about the environmentalist that's gone public and exposed, because we printed it off.
[01:30:15.930 --> 01:30:19.113]  It's like I asked, and lays it all out, so here it is.
[01:30:38.651 --> 01:30:40.532]  Who are you talking to?
[01:30:40.572 --> 01:30:40.852]  Huh?
[01:30:40.892 --> 01:30:42.733]  You got something to say, little boy?
[01:30:42.873 --> 01:30:44.533]  You got something to say, little boy?
[01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:46.294]  No, you don't, do you?
[01:30:46.334 --> 01:30:47.134]  Why don't you?
[01:30:47.195 --> 01:30:49.275]  No, I'll stand wherever I want.
[01:30:49.355 --> 01:30:51.936]  I think you guys represent something very bad.
[01:30:52.016 --> 01:30:52.497]  Yeah, what?
[01:30:52.557 --> 01:30:53.057]  No, no, no.
[01:30:53.097 --> 01:30:54.137]  Why don't you cover my ass?
[01:30:54.157 --> 01:30:54.918]  You're sorry.
[01:30:54.938 --> 01:30:56.758]  Tell me a little bit about yourself.
[01:30:56.878 --> 01:30:58.079]  Where are you from?
[01:30:58.099 --> 01:30:58.579]  I'm from NYC.
[01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:00.020]  Where the f*** are you?
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:00.880]  Well, you know what?
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.342]  I can walk wherever I want.
[01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:04.743]  I can walk wherever I want.
[01:31:04.783 --> 01:31:06.545]  Yeah, but she's like an 8-year-old woman.
[01:31:06.585 --> 01:31:07.165]  You're like 12.
[01:31:07.205 --> 01:31:08.647]  Watch your mouth.
[01:31:08.707 --> 01:31:09.507]  Watch your mouth.
[01:31:09.648 --> 01:31:12.150]  You don't go chest-to-chest with a woman?
[01:31:12.170 --> 01:31:14.732]  You don't chest-to-chest with a woman, tough guy?
[01:31:14.752 --> 01:31:16.254]  Chest-to-chest with a woman!
[01:31:19.396 --> 01:31:20.557]  Exactly.
[01:31:20.597 --> 01:31:22.478]  With no history.
[01:31:22.518 --> 01:31:25.580]  With no history whatsoever.
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:32.123]  Learn your history.
[01:31:32.503 --> 01:31:37.106]  If you learn your history, you wouldn't be a radical.
[01:31:37.126 --> 01:31:39.847]  You go to American University?
[01:31:40.047 --> 01:31:40.848]  Yeah, look at that.
[01:31:40.868 --> 01:31:41.648]  That's embarrassing.
[01:31:41.668 --> 01:31:42.188]  That's horrible.
[01:31:42.289 --> 01:31:44.830]  America was founded on stolen land, you bigot.
[01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:46.231]  And embarrassing.
[01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:47.211]  This kid's a bigot.
[01:31:47.231 --> 01:31:48.512]  He goes to a bigot university.
[01:31:48.752 --> 01:31:51.054]  They got a lot of nerve when there's a lot of people.
[01:31:51.114 --> 01:31:52.435]  Why don't you step inside there?
[01:31:52.495 --> 01:31:53.637]  Why don't you stop?
[01:31:53.677 --> 01:31:54.778]  You didn't know what to say to me.
[01:31:54.798 --> 01:31:55.518]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:31:55.618 --> 01:31:56.059]  You're right.
[01:31:56.099 --> 01:31:57.120]  You didn't know what to say.
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:57.720]  I'm so sorry.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.401]  You're right.
[01:31:58.501 --> 01:31:59.802]  I don't know what to say.
[01:31:59.822 --> 01:32:00.503]  You're bigots.
[01:32:00.563 --> 01:32:02.204]  You don't understand the Constitution.
[01:32:02.224 --> 01:32:03.706]  Is that the best you got, dolly boy?
[01:32:03.806 --> 01:32:05.668]  Is that the best you got, baby boy?
[01:32:05.688 --> 01:32:07.169]  Is that the best you got?
[01:32:07.209 --> 01:32:08.610]  Is that the best you got?
[01:32:20.877 --> 01:32:34.903]  Alright, I have literally hundreds of amazing stories to break down here, but I just want to point you again to InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Bandai Video, where the state of Texas confirms they've been ordered to falsify the number of COVID cases at least 15 times.
[01:32:36.397 --> 01:32:38.958]  And that they're not testing to see if someone has COVID.
[01:32:38.978 --> 01:32:41.980]  But if you have a runny nose or a sore throat, they say you have COVID.
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:44.842]  And then anyone around you, they then count as COVID.
[01:32:44.882 --> 01:32:46.923]  The lowest number is 15 additional people.
[01:32:47.783 --> 01:32:53.667]  So based on fraudulent non-testing, they then create a nexus point to create 15 more people, bare minimum.
[01:32:56.128 --> 01:32:57.669]  State of Texas has put the documents out.
[01:32:59.218 --> 01:33:00.720]  If we put up with this, we deserve what we get.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:02.502]  I mean, Fauci is an outrageous criminal.
[01:33:02.522 --> 01:33:06.146]  We're going to show you a video in a moment of Fauci at the congressional hearing.
[01:33:06.186 --> 01:33:07.708]  As soon as the hearing's over, he takes the mask off.
[01:33:08.369 --> 01:33:11.572]  It's a little clown mask he wears to look, oh, I'm Fauci.
[01:33:11.813 --> 01:33:13.034]  Oh, Trump needs to wear it.
[01:33:13.174 --> 01:33:14.295]  Oh, look, Pence is good.
[01:33:14.335 --> 01:33:14.876]  He wore it.
[01:33:15.337 --> 01:33:16.158]  Disgusting.
[01:33:17.401 --> 01:33:23.263]  They said 2.5 million will be dead, then 2.2 million, then 1.7 million, then 1 million, then 500,000 by now.
[01:33:23.543 --> 01:33:30.146]  And now they are on Fox News yesterday saying 30,000 will die by November election if we don't do it.
[01:33:30.546 --> 01:33:31.126]  Save the 30,000.
[01:33:31.766 --> 01:33:33.547]  Save your grandmother.
[01:33:33.867 --> 01:33:35.608]  Save those that could be killed by it.
[01:33:36.128 --> 01:33:38.349]  That's where they ship people with COVID is to your grandmother to kill her.
[01:33:40.526 --> 01:33:42.647]  I mean, this hoax is going down fast.
[01:33:43.148 --> 01:33:48.170]  And the left, where I live in Austin, is running around screaming and cussing at people who aren't wearing masks.
[01:33:48.251 --> 01:33:49.491]  I mean, it happened to me this morning.
[01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:51.933]  They're like, through the window.
[01:33:51.953 --> 01:33:55.235]  I look over, this guy's like, F you, F you, wearing his mask.
[01:33:55.295 --> 01:33:56.455]  And I'm like, you know who I am?
[01:33:56.515 --> 01:33:57.536]  No, wear a mask!
[01:33:57.836 --> 01:33:59.237]  Because he's a hero, see?
[01:33:59.577 --> 01:34:00.598]  And I'm a bad man.
[01:34:01.198 --> 01:34:04.440]  In my car, with my windows up, and he's in La La Land.
[01:34:11.618 --> 01:34:12.679]  I want to play this clip.
[01:34:14.259 --> 01:34:18.201]  This is out of... It's a long clip.
[01:34:18.221 --> 01:34:19.061]  I'll just play a little bit of it.
[01:34:20.002 --> 01:34:23.183]  And I hope it's bleep, because last night when I was up here at the office, I said, please bleep it.
[01:34:23.764 --> 01:34:24.424]  We'll see what happens.
[01:34:24.444 --> 01:34:27.906]  Because I want anything put in the file to be bleep.
[01:34:27.966 --> 01:34:28.606]  Nothing against the crew.
[01:34:28.626 --> 01:34:29.146]  They're great people.
[01:34:29.186 --> 01:34:31.587]  It just keeps happening, so I kind of get nervous when a new clip's in.
[01:34:32.908 --> 01:34:37.050]  And it's in Seattle, and poor little woman cuts this guy off, flips him off, yells at him.
[01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:38.350]  So he pulls in behind her.
[01:34:38.370 --> 01:34:39.131]  Not a good idea.
[01:34:41.104 --> 01:34:47.948]  But she then goes into this Karen event, like Lady with the Dog in Central Park, and starts just totally spazzing out.
[01:34:47.988 --> 01:34:52.170]  So this is kind of the collapse of evolution here, and what these Karens turn into.
[01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:52.770]  So here it is.
[01:34:56.592 --> 01:34:57.933]  Karen, are you okay?
[01:34:59.714 --> 01:35:01.135]  Can you explain to me calmly?
[01:35:03.596 --> 01:35:04.617]  I'm not attacking you.
[01:35:04.917 --> 01:35:06.258]  Ma'am, you flicked me off.
[01:35:08.103 --> 01:35:09.784]  Guys, this is her license plate number.
[01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:10.525]  She lives here.
[01:35:10.765 --> 01:35:11.745]  This is her address.
[01:35:15.008 --> 01:35:16.208]  Karen, you flipped me off.
[01:35:16.789 --> 01:35:21.152]  You cut me off and flipped me off and now you're playing the victim.
[01:35:21.552 --> 01:35:22.933]  Ma'am, would you like to calm down?
[01:35:25.875 --> 01:35:27.296]  Guys, she flipped me off.
[01:35:27.756 --> 01:35:30.458]  She literally flipped me off and then she... Let's hit pause again.
[01:35:30.478 --> 01:35:32.359]  This guy was a Postmates food delivery driver.
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:33.900]  She cut him off, flipped him out.
[01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:36.389]  Poorly, there's witnesses too.
[01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:39.130]  He still got in trouble and got fired from his job, we're told.
[01:35:40.591 --> 01:35:42.951]  But again, this is the type of hysteria.
[01:35:43.011 --> 01:35:56.556]  And this morning, it wasn't a female Karen, it was a male Karen, threw, he has his window down, screaming and cussing and hyperventilating at me at an access road to a highway.
[01:35:57.136 --> 01:36:01.717]  And I look over and he's flipping me off that I don't have a mask on.
[01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:03.578]  This is the cult.
[01:36:03.898 --> 01:36:04.438]  Let's continue.
[01:36:05.814 --> 01:36:08.056]  Karen, would you like to calm down and have a conversation?
[01:36:08.076 --> 01:36:12.140]  Why are you... Am I attacking her?
[01:36:14.242 --> 01:36:15.663]  Ma'am, I'm not attacking you.
[01:36:15.943 --> 01:36:18.445]  You flipped me off and you thought you could get away with it.
[01:36:18.726 --> 01:36:20.147]  You didn't think I would find you.
[01:36:20.167 --> 01:36:26.753]  Sounds like a puppy that's been grabbed by a pit bull.
[01:36:33.999 --> 01:36:35.119]  I'm trying to talk to you.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:36.860]  My name is Carlos.
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.020]  Would you like to speak to me?
[01:36:40.041 --> 01:36:41.702]  This is what we get.
[01:36:41.722 --> 01:36:43.442]  Ma'am, why are you sitting here crying?
[01:36:43.462 --> 01:36:45.743]  What have I done to you?
[01:36:45.783 --> 01:36:47.084]  Ma'am, what have I done to you?
[01:36:48.544 --> 01:36:49.945]  It's like a coyote.
[01:36:50.005 --> 01:36:50.745]  You ever heard of coyotes?
[01:36:50.765 --> 01:36:52.605]  They don't do like wolves.
[01:36:52.625 --> 01:36:55.586]  So you can go around and cut me off.
[01:36:55.847 --> 01:36:56.867]  So you didn't flip me off.
[01:36:59.056 --> 01:37:05.317]  By the way, he says he called her the n-word too, which I believe because I've never heard right-wingers or people call people the n-word.
[01:37:05.337 --> 01:37:05.838]  I've never heard it.
[01:37:06.298 --> 01:37:08.098]  But the left is like obsessed with it.
[01:37:08.498 --> 01:37:13.699]  I've been out in Hollywood many times with major Hollywood stars, and they just start talking crap about black people.
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:17.380]  And other people.
[01:37:19.241 --> 01:37:21.001]  And you're like, are you trying to see if I'm in your club?
[01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:22.041]  Because I'm not in that club.
[01:37:22.061 --> 01:37:24.122]  If I'm gonna call somebody by name, it's to their face.
[01:37:26.534 --> 01:37:28.397]  And again, I believe it.
[01:37:28.497 --> 01:37:30.340]  He says he called her at the n-word as well.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.263]  Here, let's go ahead and continue with the freaking out.
[01:37:34.146 --> 01:37:35.327]  You cannot sit.
[01:37:35.668 --> 01:37:37.390]  She literally flipped me off.
[01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:38.292]  She cut me off.
[01:37:38.812 --> 01:37:40.214]  I have it on camera.
[01:37:41.883 --> 01:37:46.445]  She flipped me off three blocks away, and then she slammed on her brakes.
[01:37:46.705 --> 01:37:48.025]  I have it on my Instagram.
[01:37:48.365 --> 01:37:49.365]  And then I got on my car.
[01:37:49.385 --> 01:37:50.826]  I'm like, ma'am, why are you following me?
[01:37:50.946 --> 01:37:52.627]  She literally followed me.
[01:37:52.947 --> 01:37:55.087]  So then I followed her back home.
[01:37:55.608 --> 01:37:58.288]  And I said, ma'am, why are you being harassing me?
[01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:01.910]  Ma'am, let's just stop there.
[01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:02.330]  Turn it off.
[01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:04.590]  And look, he shouldn't have followed her.
[01:38:04.610 --> 01:38:05.931]  His name is Carlos Dillard.
[01:38:07.671 --> 01:38:10.592]  But I'll be honest, I shouldn't have rolled the window down and been yelling back at these people today.
[01:38:10.612 --> 01:38:16.253]  I mean, I was laughing at them, but the left wants to make you behave and do what they say.
[01:38:16.973 --> 01:38:18.353]  Because they can't run their own lives.
[01:38:20.314 --> 01:38:23.394]  That's what all this is about, and it's getting crazier and crazier.
[01:38:23.994 --> 01:38:25.715]  I mentioned this, we have a special guest coming up.
[01:38:26.415 --> 01:38:29.216]  The article is Environmental Progress on behalf of environmentalists.
[01:38:29.596 --> 01:38:31.236]  I apologize for the climate scare.
[01:38:32.927 --> 01:38:50.697]  And his name is Michael Schnellenberg, and he's a very well-known author and environmentalist who spent decades in the rainforest and everywhere else, and he now comes out and says, it's all a cult, it's all a fraud, it almost destroyed my family, it turned my daughter into a mental patient, and he said it's all based on lies.
[01:38:50.737 --> 01:38:54.579]  Carbon dioxide's good, a heating earth is good, even though it hasn't really heated.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:01.583]  And I apologize, this covers up for the genetic engineering, the leaking reactors,
[01:39:02.924 --> 01:39:03.424]  He gets it.
[01:39:03.444 --> 01:39:05.204]  I mean, because let me tell you, I care about the environment.
[01:39:05.224 --> 01:39:05.724]  We're all in it.
[01:39:07.645 --> 01:39:11.285]  Major environmental groups go, radiation is good now because it gets rid of humans.
[01:39:11.325 --> 01:39:12.186]  It gets rid of everything.
[01:39:13.206 --> 01:39:16.626]  And I'm not against nuclear power, except it's never been implemented correctly.
[01:39:16.886 --> 01:39:17.566]  They all leak.
[01:39:17.807 --> 01:39:18.607]  They all suck.
[01:39:20.167 --> 01:39:26.568]  And genetic engineering out of control, toxic waste dumping, overfishing, plastic dumping, all that stuff's real.
[01:39:26.948 --> 01:39:29.529]  But this stuff about carbon dioxide is a joke.
[01:39:30.009 --> 01:39:32.189]  We have the lowest level of carbon dioxide ever recorded.
[01:39:33.453 --> 01:39:35.214]  It's super low, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:39.416]  Plants used to have dozens of times higher carbon dioxide.
[01:39:39.797 --> 01:39:41.177]  You know it's not 1%, right?
[01:39:43.519 --> 01:39:44.699]  And then they let off the oxygen.
[01:39:44.939 --> 01:39:46.060]  Oxygen's low on the planet.
[01:39:47.161 --> 01:39:51.023]  It's like humans took over and woke up right when the planet was dying, like Mars.
[01:39:51.603 --> 01:39:57.967]  A lot of evidence shows Mars had oceans on it, but it wasn't a big enough planet to hold its atmosphere, and it lost its atmosphere.
[01:39:58.848 --> 01:40:00.189]  Well, let's not lose our atmosphere.
[01:40:00.209 --> 01:40:03.871]  It's a very powerful article where he lays out all the facts.
[01:40:04.311 --> 01:40:05.872]  It's posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:40:05.892 --> 01:40:07.693]  I hope you research it and look at it.
[01:40:07.753 --> 01:40:16.977]  But, coming up, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side, Christina Gomez, who knocked it out of the park.
[01:40:16.997 --> 01:40:22.220]  We're going to play her speech to the, what was it, Palm Beach County Commissioner.
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:23.841]  She annihilated them.
[01:40:25.703 --> 01:40:37.952]  And now on top of what she exposed, because that's right where they cover up the pedophile rings, with Jeffrey Epstein right there, Berlin says 30,000 pedophiles connected to the government running kidnapped children for sex rings.
[01:40:38.352 --> 01:40:38.792]  Wow!
[01:40:39.213 --> 01:40:40.634]  BBC, look at that headline.
[01:40:41.454 --> 01:40:41.874]  Wow!
[01:40:42.015 --> 01:40:43.876]  Praise God, praise Jesus for that one.
[01:40:44.636 --> 01:40:46.398]  The Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost!
[01:40:47.438 --> 01:40:47.959]  I'm loving it!
[01:40:49.099 --> 01:40:52.220]  Because their whole house of cards is coming down and that's why they're so scared.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:53.521]  That's why they shut the economy down.
[01:40:53.541 --> 01:40:55.162]  That's why they're trying to cause race wars.
[01:40:55.742 --> 01:40:57.123]  And that's why they're so damn scared.
[01:40:57.203 --> 01:40:58.323]  And so let's not be overconfident.
[01:40:58.343 --> 01:40:59.144]  Let's trust in God.
[01:41:00.464 --> 01:41:12.330]  And let's pass the ammunition when it comes to the info war and realize that when you share an article or a video or information via text message, word of mouth, however you do it, those are the areas that aren't censored completely yet.
[01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:14.651]  It changes the world and they're so scared.
[01:41:15.658 --> 01:41:30.229]  That 120,000 people since this morning have seen our new report confirming the CDC and NIH fake the numbers, at least 15 times the COVID numbers, and call those they call potential cases, cases to create fear.
[01:41:30.569 --> 01:41:32.231]  It's at man.video, the featured video.
[01:41:33.763 --> 01:41:36.044]  Only you can prevent New World Order takeovers.
[01:41:37.084 --> 01:41:39.025]  Only you can prevent forest fires.
[01:41:39.065 --> 01:41:41.106]  Well, only you can carry the ball.
[01:41:41.246 --> 01:41:50.189]  So please, for myself and you and all of us together, get it out on your email list every way you can and override these globalists and break their will.
[01:41:50.569 --> 01:41:51.290]  We'll be right back.
[01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:51.810]  Stay with us.
[01:41:53.151 --> 01:41:55.313]  We are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:41:55.433 --> 01:42:05.962]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and here's a clip of Christina Gomez in Florida, I guess it was in Palm Beach, laying out the fact that they're aware of the mask-wearing ordinance they passed, saying everybody's going to wear a mask for the next year.
[01:42:05.982 --> 01:42:06.903]  She got really pissed.
[01:42:07.223 --> 01:42:07.823]  It went viral.
[01:42:07.863 --> 01:42:08.224]  Here it is.
[01:42:09.730 --> 01:42:15.014]  You literally cannot mandate somebody to wear a mask knowing that that mask is killing people.
[01:42:15.354 --> 01:42:16.875]  It literally is killing people.
[01:42:17.256 --> 01:42:20.338]  And my, the people, we the people, are waking up.
[01:42:20.538 --> 01:42:22.219]  And we know what citizen's arrest is.
[01:42:22.359 --> 01:42:24.821]  Because citizen's arrests are already happening.
[01:42:25.201 --> 01:42:25.522]  Okay?
[01:42:25.962 --> 01:42:31.666]  And every single one of you that are obeying the devil's laws are going to be arrested.
[01:42:31.986 --> 01:42:32.327]  And you?
[01:42:32.927 --> 01:42:37.048]  Doctors are going to be arrested for crimes against humanity.
[01:42:37.328 --> 01:42:44.790]  Every single one of you have a smirk behind that little mask, but every single one of you are going to get punished by God.
[01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:47.711]  You cannot, you cannot escape God.
[01:42:48.211 --> 01:42:49.371]  You cannot escape God.
[01:42:49.391 --> 01:42:50.352]  I'm going to say that again.
[01:42:50.712 --> 01:42:54.853]  You cannot escape God, not even with a mask or six feet.
[01:42:55.313 --> 01:42:55.613]  Okay?
[01:42:55.953 --> 01:42:58.855]  Six feet, like I said before, is military protocol.
[01:42:58.895 --> 01:43:04.799]  You're trying to get the people to train them so when the cameras, the 5G comes out, what?
[01:43:05.359 --> 01:43:07.041]  They're gonna scan everybody?
[01:43:07.061 --> 01:43:07.921]  We gotta get scanned?
[01:43:07.941 --> 01:43:08.902]  We gotta get temperatured?
[01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:10.983]  The kids have to go to school with masks?
[01:43:11.203 --> 01:43:12.264]  Are you insane?
[01:43:12.784 --> 01:43:13.765]  Are you crazy?
[01:43:14.385 --> 01:43:17.868]  I think all of you should be in a psych ward right the heck now.
[01:43:18.309 --> 01:43:23.653]  Because none of you, none of you know what the hell you are all talking about.
[01:43:24.014 --> 01:43:25.175]  This is insane.
[01:43:25.375 --> 01:43:28.438]  And then you want to open this meeting with a prayer to God.
[01:43:28.498 --> 01:43:29.559]  Are you praying to the devil?
[01:43:29.799 --> 01:43:31.660]  Because God is not listening to that prayer.
[01:43:32.001 --> 01:43:35.424]  Because all of you are practicing the devil's laws.
[01:43:35.764 --> 01:43:36.725]  What happened to Bill Gates?
[01:43:37.165 --> 01:43:38.266]  Why is he not in jail?
[01:43:38.506 --> 01:43:40.047]  Why is Hillary Clinton not in jail?
[01:43:40.328 --> 01:43:47.413]  Why are all of these pedophiles that are demanding you all to listen to their rules, why are they not in jail?
[01:43:48.014 --> 01:43:49.475]  Oh, is it because you're part of them?
[01:43:49.835 --> 01:43:50.836]  Are you part of the deep state?
[01:43:50.856 --> 01:43:51.596]  Your time has expired.
[01:43:51.616 --> 01:43:52.777]  The deep state is going down.
[01:43:52.857 --> 01:43:55.760]  And if any of you are in the deep state, you're going down with it.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:01.922]  Well, Palm Beach did help cover up for Epstein and the giant globalist CIA, Mossad, MI6.
[01:44:02.483 --> 01:44:05.224]  Had a fall ring for a while, but it was people in the police department that helped expose it.
[01:44:05.264 --> 01:44:07.565]  So, just like everything else, it's good people and bad people.
[01:44:07.605 --> 01:44:12.908]  But yeah, here is Fauci, video of Fauci, in hearings yesterday.
[01:44:13.528 --> 01:44:15.869]  And as soon as the cameras are off, he takes the mask off.
[01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:20.591]  It's a mask, a clown mask, to show he's good, you're bad.
[01:44:20.872 --> 01:44:21.512]  Here's that video.
[01:44:24.292 --> 01:44:25.353]  All right, so his hearing's over.
[01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:26.934]  They clap for him.
[01:44:27.014 --> 01:44:28.735]  Oh, you're such a good little liar for Big Pharma.
[01:44:31.477 --> 01:44:32.538]  He doesn't care if everybody hates him.
[01:44:32.578 --> 01:44:32.979]  He loves it.
[01:44:32.999 --> 01:44:34.059]  He ran the AIDS hoax.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:35.501]  Everything.
[01:44:35.521 --> 01:44:36.001]  There he is.
[01:44:37.342 --> 01:44:38.803]  Hits the mayor while they're in recess.
[01:44:39.624 --> 01:44:42.806]  Doesn't need to wear that mask when he's not on TV.
[01:44:44.547 --> 01:44:47.069]  And it turns out, no mask, Nevada.
[01:44:48.170 --> 01:44:49.631]  Resist governor who mandates mask.
[01:44:50.882 --> 01:44:54.805]  What would you make of this incredible time we're living in?
[01:44:54.825 --> 01:44:56.446]  What would I make of it?
[01:44:56.466 --> 01:44:57.487]  I would make it... I don't even know.
[01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:23.876]  I would say it's the devil's playground right now.
[01:45:26.718 --> 01:45:28.399]  Well, yep, we're on air.
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:29.200]  Go ahead.
[01:45:31.321 --> 01:45:32.202]  That's what I think of it.
[01:45:32.242 --> 01:45:33.523]  I just think it's chaos.
[01:45:36.005 --> 01:45:38.707]  What else would you want to say to the City Council if you had more time?
[01:45:40.328 --> 01:45:41.749]  If I had more time?
[01:45:43.539 --> 01:45:54.247]  I would say to fire every single doctor that is getting paid to say what they're saying, that masks are good, that masks are protecting everybody.
[01:45:55.468 --> 01:46:00.251]  And I would say, that's pretty much what I would say.
[01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:06.115]  All of them have to get fired because none of them are doing their job.
[01:46:07.785 --> 01:46:08.105]  Thank you.
[01:46:25.064 --> 01:46:25.685]  I don't know.
[01:46:42.214 --> 01:46:59.324]  There's the natural therapeutics like vitamin C, vitamin D3, zinc and other things that they're so desperate to keep people away from, but what do you make of it coming out that they're counting people that died of other things as COVID, that the NIH is ordering states to say that just anybody they think might have it as a case?
[01:46:59.704 --> 01:47:03.666]  I mean this is just incredible fraud and they're not getting in trouble for it, they're just doubling down.
[01:47:05.847 --> 01:47:06.868]  I'm sorry, say that again?
[01:47:11.664 --> 01:47:12.024]  Hold on.
[01:47:12.205 --> 01:47:12.965]  Yeah, it's okay.
[01:47:13.025 --> 01:47:13.506]  It's alright.
[01:47:14.347 --> 01:47:15.968]  You can't hear me, can you, over the audio?
[01:47:15.988 --> 01:47:17.910]  The phone callers can't ever hear me.
[01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:18.971]  It's an ongoing deal.
[01:47:18.991 --> 01:47:20.112]  I probably should stop doing the show.
[01:47:20.373 --> 01:47:21.333]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:47:21.354 --> 01:47:21.654]  Thank you.
[01:47:21.674 --> 01:47:23.536]  Alright, that's it for that interview.
[01:47:23.616 --> 01:47:24.036]  Thank you.
[01:47:24.096 --> 01:47:24.416]  We're done.
[01:47:24.577 --> 01:47:25.137]  Appreciate it.
[01:47:26.458 --> 01:47:27.840]  Certain point I gotta give up.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:29.241]  I'll just go to rebroadcast.
[01:47:30.122 --> 01:47:34.106]  Damn.
[01:47:34.166 --> 01:47:34.987]  Man, I tell you, it's hard.
[01:47:36.823 --> 01:47:37.583]  Callers can't hear me.
[01:47:37.943 --> 01:47:38.543]  Guests can't hear me.
[01:47:39.264 --> 01:47:40.144]  So I'm not complaining.
[01:47:40.624 --> 01:47:43.645]  But when I've been a guest on the show, I can't hear very well.
[01:47:44.505 --> 01:47:45.685]  And the same thing's on Skype.
[01:47:46.246 --> 01:47:53.107]  And so it's just this endless thing of, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, like Groundhog Day.
[01:47:53.128 --> 01:47:54.648]  And at a certain point, I just gotta throw my hands up.
[01:47:54.988 --> 01:48:03.570]  Because you know, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again, isn't it?
[01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:05.431]  So someday, we're gonna get
[01:48:07.617 --> 01:48:08.137]  Zoom.
[01:48:08.377 --> 01:48:09.418]  Oh, that isn't secure.
[01:48:09.478 --> 01:48:10.138]  None of it's secure.
[01:48:10.538 --> 01:48:25.022]  Or we're gonna get FaceTime for the guests because Microsoft bought Skype like five years ago and it went straight to hell the minute it did because Bill Gates is spying on you and running scams and everything he does is a criminal operation.
[01:48:26.803 --> 01:48:27.203]  Everything.
[01:48:29.636 --> 01:48:30.457]  Bill Gates does.
[01:48:31.257 --> 01:48:32.058]  He's a fraud.
[01:48:32.338 --> 01:48:37.002]  Whatever you think the product is about, it's something completely different.
[01:48:37.682 --> 01:48:43.867]  So, when we come back, I'm gonna dutifully go through all these clips, and I'm gonna cover the news.
[01:48:43.887 --> 01:48:48.290]  We may not be able to have guests on the show anymore, though, just because of technical issues.
[01:48:48.370 --> 01:48:50.832]  But that's okay, we can fly people here and have them in studio.
[01:48:52.273 --> 01:48:53.634]  So, we've got all that coming up.
[01:48:54.095 --> 01:48:55.616]  Big Roger Stone interview today.
[01:48:57.605 --> 01:49:07.573]  Big exclusive on that front, and the big news about Berlin authorities, and now the entire state of Germany, the entire country of Germany, running giant child sex rings.
[01:49:08.073 --> 01:49:10.335]  That is such good news that that's coming out.
[01:49:10.775 --> 01:49:11.816]  Bad news that's happening.
[01:49:12.437 --> 01:49:16.660]  And we're going to be looking at every facet of that, plus Biden's latest ridiculous speech.
[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:22.805]  We really appreciate that lady and the words she had to say and the great job she did there in Palm Beach, Florida.
[01:49:23.345 --> 01:49:28.029]  We also have a Seattle Police Chief with some of the things that she had to say from CHOP while she was booed.
[01:49:28.489 --> 01:49:29.470]  That is all coming up.
[01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:30.711]  So a jam-packed final.
[01:49:32.012 --> 01:49:40.897]  30 minutes today ahead of a very special guest host who's going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:49:41.197 --> 01:49:44.338]  Jay Dyer, who was a guest last week, really liked him.
[01:49:44.759 --> 01:49:48.220]  So he's going to be hosting the fourth hour today because Paul Watson is out at a function.
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:51.622]  But Paul is going to be back hosting one of the shows later in the week.
[01:49:51.682 --> 01:49:53.363]  Did we ever find out which show Paul's going to host?
[01:49:55.584 --> 01:49:56.124]  Thursday.
[01:49:56.484 --> 01:50:01.287]  So Paul Joseph Watson is going to be hosting the show on Thursday.
[01:50:02.628 --> 01:50:05.232]  And again, we're going to try to tweak the phone system where you can hear us.
[01:50:05.292 --> 01:50:06.153]  I'm sorry for that.
[01:50:06.834 --> 01:50:07.095]  We'll see.
[01:50:07.135 --> 01:50:08.337]  Maybe bring calls back someday.
[01:50:08.878 --> 01:50:09.238]  All right.
[01:50:09.278 --> 01:50:10.320]  We'll be back on the other side.
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:11.622]  Infowars.com.
[01:50:12.042 --> 01:50:13.084]  Newswars.com.
[01:50:13.104 --> 01:50:14.226]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:50:14.646 --> 01:50:15.608]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:50:18.905 --> 01:50:21.046]  You know, I got Alex Jones here back live.
[01:50:21.066 --> 01:50:27.370]  A lot of positive things are happening, but it's also very psychically negative to look at all this bad news coming out.
[01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:28.931]  And I get frustrated and get mad on air.
[01:50:28.951 --> 01:50:32.393]  It has nothing to do with the listeners, the crew, or anybody, or the guest that was on.
[01:50:32.433 --> 01:50:33.454]  It's just technology.
[01:50:33.474 --> 01:50:34.235]  I get frustrated.
[01:50:35.115 --> 01:50:35.916]  But at least we're on air.
[01:50:35.936 --> 01:50:36.856]  At least we're fighting back.
[01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:39.318]  Nobody's going to do a perfect job in this.
[01:50:41.087 --> 01:51:02.358]  But when I sit here and I look at hundreds of articles and documents and government reports where COVID-19 is a giant hoax, confirmed, and then I got to look at Fauci on TV lying, and I've got to look at the Democrats saying it's all America's fault, and the EU locking their borders down saying it's all our fault, and then people cussing at me at red lights.
[01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:08.272]  And I've had some crew members had folks confront them in stores or on the street and get in their face.
[01:51:09.112 --> 01:51:09.893]  And I'm in Texas.
[01:51:09.953 --> 01:51:11.134]  It's not as bad as most states.
[01:51:11.254 --> 01:51:12.634]  It's just crazy!
[01:51:13.415 --> 01:51:18.518]  What do you say to a cult member who's got a mask that doesn't protect them from something that barely exists?
[01:51:20.359 --> 01:51:22.280]  Then you start thinking, what are they going to do next?
[01:51:22.861 --> 01:51:28.124]  Because they've got an army of domesticated followers that will do whatever they're told.
[01:51:30.911 --> 01:51:32.034]  So we're all pissed off about it.
[01:51:32.655 --> 01:51:37.345]  So I apologize to the listeners for throwing fits sometimes and getting angry at everybody else.
[01:51:37.405 --> 01:51:40.832]  But let's cover what I can cover.
[01:51:41.333 --> 01:51:41.774]  Coming up...
[01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:44.503]  The next big thing is the flu.
[01:51:44.663 --> 01:51:46.103]  It's going to be a pandemic now.
[01:51:46.423 --> 01:51:47.644]  And the flu does kill people.
[01:51:47.684 --> 01:51:49.884]  So now they're going to fetishize flu death.
[01:51:50.685 --> 01:51:54.226]  And they're going to fetishize it spreading and exaggerate it.
[01:51:54.286 --> 01:51:56.126]  And we've got a lockdown for the flu.
[01:51:56.406 --> 01:51:56.646]  See?
[01:51:57.327 --> 01:52:01.348]  Once you get into this hysteria, and once you get into all this, it just never ends.
[01:52:01.368 --> 01:52:02.048]  But don't worry.
[01:52:02.848 --> 01:52:04.889]  Bill Gates has got a nice vaccine for you.
[01:52:05.409 --> 01:52:06.029]  That's coming up.
[01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.950]  Kit Daniels' article.
[01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.910]  Infowars.com.
[01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:09.891]  Media pushing pig viruses.
[01:52:09.931 --> 01:52:10.911]  Potential next pandemic.
[01:52:11.852 --> 01:52:13.773]  And here's the article he's linking to.
[01:52:13.793 --> 01:52:14.474]  He writes about it.
[01:52:15.975 --> 01:52:22.159]  New strain of flu found in China has potential to become a pandemic, scientists warn.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.422]  Coronavirus mutation has taken over the world.
[01:52:27.842 --> 01:52:30.204]  Scientists are trying to understand why.
[01:52:35.347 --> 01:52:41.151]  But let's look at the utopia of Chaz that quickly changed into Chomp.
[01:52:43.342 --> 01:52:47.026]  And not because they have fake guillotines out there talking about cutting white people's heads off.
[01:52:47.046 --> 01:52:51.150]  And by the way, I'm not virtue-suing black people.
[01:52:51.210 --> 01:52:53.492]  It's mainly white people leading all this saying kill white people.
[01:52:54.033 --> 01:53:01.300]  Kind of an oxymoron, like when Abe Skrillex yells at Owen Schroer, you don't have free speech, you're an effing white male.
[01:53:02.582 --> 01:53:06.145]  Let's see, by alchemy, if you're against a white male and a white male, then you have your speech.
[01:53:06.225 --> 01:53:06.646]  Remember that.
[01:53:08.464 --> 01:53:15.789]  Seattle Police Chief Asked Why Black People Keep Dying In The Black Lives Matter Chop Zone Killed By Black People.
[01:53:17.130 --> 01:53:20.893]  Bill de Blasio Confirms $1 Billion Cut From New York PD Budget.
[01:53:21.893 --> 01:53:24.695]  He Said On The News Today We're Going To Redistribute It To Community Groups.
[01:53:24.715 --> 01:53:25.596]  He Means To Communists.
[01:53:25.656 --> 01:53:26.917]  Look At That Creepy Guy.
[01:53:27.357 --> 01:53:28.498]  He's Here To Babysit.
[01:53:30.319 --> 01:53:31.740]  He's Not As Creepy As Brian Stelter.
[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:32.741]  He's A Close Second Though.
[01:53:33.922 --> 01:53:35.883]  Not Saying de Blasio Is A Child Molester.
[01:53:36.584 --> 01:53:37.765]  I'm Saying He Looks Like One.
[01:53:38.649 --> 01:53:38.969]  Doesn't he?
[01:53:40.871 --> 01:53:46.096]  Minneapolis City Council members using private security after voting to abolish police.
[01:53:47.798 --> 01:53:54.504]  Turns out they've already spent $60,000, $4,500 a day in the last month to protect themselves.
[01:53:55.485 --> 01:54:00.870]  Agitators could be charged with trespassing, assault after confronting armed homeowners.
[01:54:01.834 --> 01:54:07.236]  Though the prosecutor says they may prosecute them, saying it doesn't matter if they had a gate that we now learn was broken down.
[01:54:07.837 --> 01:54:08.977]  It's still hateful what they did.
[01:54:10.178 --> 01:54:12.019]  So now you can't protect your own house.
[01:54:12.259 --> 01:54:12.599]  Wow.
[01:54:12.999 --> 01:54:16.100]  Black Lives Matter chapter co-founder called white people defects.
[01:54:17.881 --> 01:54:20.322]  New York Times writer called for whites to be killed.
[01:54:20.422 --> 01:54:20.963]  That's okay.
[01:54:20.983 --> 01:54:22.343]  It's liberal.
[01:54:23.444 --> 01:54:30.607]  And again, Nevada Democrat governor was caught without a mask, even though he calls for those that don't wear them to be arrested at a dinner party.
[01:54:31.832 --> 01:54:33.693]  No, that's for him, not you.
[01:54:35.673 --> 01:54:42.155]  Meanwhile, Antifa, Kurds clash with fascist Muslim Turkish nationalists in Austrian streets.
[01:54:44.556 --> 01:54:47.317]  Turns out Soros is even funding Antifa overseas.
[01:54:47.377 --> 01:54:49.058]  But let's go ahead and go to some of these clips.
[01:54:50.478 --> 01:54:54.900]  Here's the Seattle police chief ask why black people keep dying in CHOP.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:55.400]  Here it is.
[01:54:56.613 --> 01:54:56.873]  I don't know.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:18.101]  Robbery and shootings.
[01:55:18.721 --> 01:55:21.622]  And so, you know, this is something that's going to need to change.
[01:55:22.182 --> 01:55:26.484]  We're asking that people remove themselves from this area for the safety of the people.
[01:55:26.844 --> 01:55:30.685]  If they care about people, they're going to have to try to help us to make it safe.
[01:55:31.506 --> 01:55:42.690]  Not opposed to anybody's issue or concern, they certainly can demonstrate, you know, and peacefully any place, but they can't hostilely take over a neighborhood and cause the crime levels to go up like this.
[01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:44.331]  Two men are dead.
[01:55:45.498 --> 01:55:52.761]  Two men are dead, and a child, a 14-year-old, is hospitalized, and we don't know what is going to happen to that kid.
[01:55:53.201 --> 01:55:54.141]  Enough is enough here.
[01:55:54.762 --> 01:56:01.765]  I'm not going to let the detractors and the naysayers and the agitators, you know, be the ones that are the voice here.
[01:56:02.005 --> 01:56:03.165]  There are people who live here.
[01:56:03.545 --> 01:56:07.667]  There are multiple people who are being injured and hurt, and we need to do something about it.
[01:56:07.967 --> 01:56:11.428]  It is absolutely irresponsible for this to continue.
[01:56:12.289 --> 01:56:15.070]  I can tell you this, as an African-American woman,
[01:56:15.650 --> 01:56:17.571]  Here's what's really going on, folks.
[01:56:17.671 --> 01:56:18.811]  It's black-on-black crime.
[01:56:18.831 --> 01:56:20.511]  It's the same in Chicago, everywhere else.
[01:56:20.591 --> 01:56:24.072]  And it's what the culture of appeasement
[01:56:44.431 --> 01:56:44.551]  That's
[01:57:03.712 --> 01:57:11.578]  Tackle and start choking and throw a young black man to the ground because he's at a flea market trying to buy something.
[01:57:11.598 --> 01:57:12.699]  He's like, I don't need to wear a mask.
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:17.943]  Instead of just saying, we're going to leave you out, they tackle him and start pushing him to the ground.
[01:57:19.685 --> 01:57:21.686]  And the black sheriff comes out and says, this was not excessive.
[01:57:25.169 --> 01:57:31.775]  So again, you've seen the videos of black cops beating up black people, white cops beating up white people and vice versa.
[01:57:32.961 --> 01:57:39.708]  If you are doing this for drugs or guns or anything else, at the end of the world, but because it's masked, oh, the police are good.
[01:57:39.728 --> 01:57:41.189]  So here it is out of North Carolina.
[01:57:41.970 --> 01:57:45.493]  Deputy throws a man to the wall and to the ground.
[01:57:45.533 --> 01:57:47.876]  They start choking him for refusing to wear a mask.
[01:57:47.936 --> 01:57:48.336]  Here it is.
[01:57:49.137 --> 01:57:50.198]  I thought you were going to the ground.
[01:57:50.218 --> 01:57:51.139]  You understand me?
[01:57:51.779 --> 01:57:53.781]  Put your hand behind your back.
[01:57:53.861 --> 01:57:55.563]  Put your hand behind your back.
[01:57:56.864 --> 01:57:57.505]  What the hell?
[01:58:05.947 --> 01:58:10.089]  By the way, it's like a parking ticket in North Carolina to not wear a mask.
[01:58:10.169 --> 01:58:15.111]  But here's the two white dudes literally choking the black dude because he's not wearing a mask.
[01:58:23.847 --> 01:58:27.768]  It's a total occult program.
[01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:29.669]  They're not even asking to leave.
[01:58:30.429 --> 01:58:32.950]  They just tackled him because they want... because they're heroes.
[01:58:34.391 --> 01:58:37.972]  They just instantly... and now the black dude helps.
[01:58:38.252 --> 01:58:44.134]  The white dude and the black dude literally attacking this white... this black guy.
[01:58:44.674 --> 01:58:45.455]  Who knows his rights.
[01:58:46.015 --> 01:58:47.075]  I want this guy on as a guest.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.741]  This is all the virtue signaling and it's all based on total fraud.
[01:58:53.921 --> 01:58:58.223]  The feds are counting people that are around someone with COVID as having it.
[01:58:58.243 --> 01:59:00.123]  That's why they're spiking those.
[01:59:00.323 --> 01:59:01.584]  The deaths aren't there.
[01:59:20.307 --> 01:59:27.273]  It's all a criminal fraud, and I'm just saying, I can restrain myself, but if the cops were doing that to me, I don't care if they're black or white.
[01:59:28.054 --> 01:59:31.377]  You start doing that to me without wearing a mask, I'd rather want it that way.
[01:59:31.417 --> 01:59:32.678]  I'm not putting up with this crap anymore.
[01:59:33.679 --> 01:59:35.200]  See, you're lucky that guy was restrained.
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:36.521]  They beat the hell out of that guy.
[01:59:36.541 --> 01:59:37.822]  They strangled him.
[01:59:37.842 --> 01:59:40.505]  I don't care what color he is, it was wrong.
[01:59:42.577 --> 01:59:46.258]  This has been one of the most powerful broadcasts we've ever done.
[01:59:47.119 --> 01:59:48.299]  Absolutely jam-packed.
[01:59:48.859 --> 01:59:50.840]  And I feel empty and pathetic.
[01:59:52.921 --> 01:59:56.062]  Because I feel like we should just do even better.
[01:59:57.162 --> 01:59:59.403]  Because we have such incredible tools.
[02:00:00.584 --> 02:00:08.326]  It is confirmed, Homeland Security, NIH, documents from the CDC, that COVID-19 is a hoax.
[02:00:10.612 --> 02:00:26.204]  That they are saying anybody with the flu, anybody with a cold has it, and that they're saying that we don't need a test to say somebody has COVID-19, and then if they say one person has it, starting with 15 and up to 36, we're gonna say that group has it.
[02:00:26.864 --> 02:00:32.508]  So if two people test positive, they're gonna say that's 70-something cases.
[02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:34.670]  We have the documents!
[02:00:34.750 --> 02:00:35.931]  We have the video!
[02:00:39.409 --> 02:00:47.534]  If I thought putting a blender on my desk and turning on high and sticking my fingers in it and chopping them off would defeat the globalist, I would stick my hand in a blender right now.
[02:00:47.814 --> 02:00:48.855]  I'm not a sadomasochist.
[02:00:48.955 --> 02:00:49.616]  I don't like pain.
[02:00:49.916 --> 02:00:51.857]  I'm saying I want to beat these people.
[02:00:52.858 --> 02:00:59.122]  And there's nothing more frustrating than sitting here knowing we have them by the balls.
[02:01:03.029 --> 02:01:06.673]  But it's like, okay, yeah, they sent people that had COVID to nursing homes to kill people.
[02:01:07.153 --> 02:01:13.560]  Yeah, they took people that had all these other diseases and heart attacks and cancer and gunshot wounds and car wrecks and skydiving accidents, literally.
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:26.133]  I mean, it's just ridiculous how they've conditioned us
[02:01:27.486 --> 02:01:35.890]  To sit here and take the lies, and then more comes up, and it's like we've seen so many lies, like, oh yeah, they're ordering 15 times the reporting?
[02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:37.011]  Oh, big deal.
[02:01:37.031 --> 02:01:40.873]  And then I had to send messages.
[02:01:41.093 --> 02:01:48.717]  I sent probably 50 messages out on text message to prominent talk show host and prominent journalist saying, listen, I don't need the credit.
[02:01:51.018 --> 02:01:54.780]  Will you please just do an article about this?
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:55.781]  And here's the raw video.
[02:01:56.926 --> 02:02:13.172]  And a few of them did it and didn't give us credit, which I don't want, but the weird mental illness that if we break something big that's confirmed, no one else will touch it just out of some weird, it's, it's a spirit of failure.
[02:02:13.973 --> 02:02:16.634]  Humanity is a rotting maggot covered corpse.
[02:02:18.490 --> 02:02:21.092]  There are a lot of good people left, but man, there's just no instinct.
[02:02:21.432 --> 02:02:23.413]  Like, I don't care who breaks something, Vic.
[02:02:23.994 --> 02:02:27.236]  If it's true and it's documented, I'm gonna promote it and give credit.
[02:02:27.416 --> 02:02:28.477]  I wanna beat these people!
[02:02:30.543 --> 02:02:55.053]  I don't give a rat's ass about who gets the credit, and I'm sitting here literally with the Death Star plans of the collapse and depression and the destruction of society and the annihilation of the third world and Trump losing the election and all of it, and we sit here and it's just like, oh, it's one more story, you know, don't promote Infowars, you might get banned.
[02:02:59.244 --> 02:03:01.326]  You know, I know all the big talk show hosts.
[02:03:01.366 --> 02:03:02.667]  I mean, almost all of them.
[02:03:03.808 --> 02:03:10.274]  And I've had private conversations with them and I've said, Oh, I noticed you won't come on my show anymore because you think you'll get banned.
[02:03:11.112 --> 02:03:12.793]  As if I even need that host on my show.
[02:03:13.253 --> 02:03:14.253]  I just think they're interesting.
[02:03:14.954 --> 02:03:15.914]  And they go, no, it's true.
[02:03:15.954 --> 02:03:17.695]  I really like you, but I don't want to come on.
[02:03:17.715 --> 02:03:19.095]  I don't want to get banned.
[02:03:19.175 --> 02:03:21.436]  And I go, you'll be banned within six months.
[02:03:22.137 --> 02:03:23.597]  They ban prominent people.
[02:03:23.637 --> 02:03:24.598]  They dole it out.
[02:03:25.218 --> 02:03:26.619]  Like Stefan Molyneux yesterday.
[02:03:27.179 --> 02:03:30.100]  So that other people go, oh, I better stop what I'm saying.
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:32.021]  I better become a leftist.
[02:03:33.442 --> 02:03:34.262]  So I won't get banned.
[02:03:35.834 --> 02:03:46.963]  Instead of everybody up front, when I got banned, standing up and saying it's wrong, no, we all hunker down, I didn't, but people do, and wait and hope they get passed over.
[02:03:47.863 --> 02:03:48.684]  You're the target.
[02:03:49.345 --> 02:03:50.846]  Paul Joseph Watson's the target.
[02:03:51.466 --> 02:03:52.847]  Stefan Molyneux's the target.
[02:03:53.308 --> 02:03:54.649]  Mike Cernovich is the target.
[02:03:57.651 --> 02:04:00.313]  All these people are the targets.
[02:04:03.636 --> 02:04:03.736]  And
[02:04:05.407 --> 02:04:15.790]  That's why authoritarians always go after one group at a time, so that they don't go after all the groups, so the other groups wait like a school of fish, saying, thank God they didn't come after me.
[02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:18.391]  Jack Posobiec, OAN.
[02:04:20.591 --> 02:04:21.692]  The list goes on and on.
[02:04:23.412 --> 02:04:24.512]  You know, OAN are good guys.
[02:04:24.572 --> 02:04:25.152]  I mean, I like them.
[02:04:25.573 --> 02:04:29.534]  And the folks that own that own Cloud TV, and it's super popular.
[02:04:30.094 --> 02:04:34.015]  InfoWars, they confirmed to me, has more viewers than all their channels combined.
[02:04:35.367 --> 02:04:36.553]  They got a hundred and something channels.
[02:04:36.775 --> 02:04:39.449]  Infowars is bigger than all their new channels combined.
[02:04:40.930 --> 02:04:43.092]  And they're like, but just don't really tell people that.
[02:04:44.433 --> 02:04:45.854]  I'm like, why don't you mimic that?
[02:04:45.914 --> 02:04:47.235]  Why don't you do better than that?
[02:04:47.515 --> 02:04:48.596]  The people want that.
[02:04:48.996 --> 02:04:50.457]  Oh God, don't, we can't do that.
[02:04:50.517 --> 02:05:01.165]  I mean, we get, and again, it's just, it's like this, this attitude, like when you're over the target and you're winning and you're dominating and people want victory, they want to destroy the globalists, they want a pro-human future.
[02:05:01.745 --> 02:05:05.308]  And it's like, everyone's like, oh, well, we want Alex to bring us their audience.
[02:05:07.315 --> 02:05:10.196]  But we don't actually want to really embrace it.
[02:05:10.656 --> 02:05:13.056]  I don't care about you embracing me.
[02:05:13.076 --> 02:05:17.697]  Do you get that I'm like super rock and roll outlaw because you don't?
[02:05:17.977 --> 02:05:20.458]  It'd be uncool if you did.
[02:05:20.478 --> 02:05:26.999]  I don't even want the credit from you.
[02:05:27.419 --> 02:05:28.960]  You know how dangerous that is?
[02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:34.421]  I knew 10 years ago we were the zeitgeist and I flew to the radar and didn't say it.
[02:05:36.755 --> 02:05:37.556]  The enemy knows.
[02:05:40.359 --> 02:05:43.863]  And let me tell you, I feel pathetic that we're the best there is.
[02:05:45.445 --> 02:05:48.248]  The most bona fide, the most genuine, the most real.
[02:05:48.488 --> 02:05:50.030]  That is what keeps me up at night.
[02:05:50.651 --> 02:05:52.393]  Because all these men aren't men.
[02:05:53.544 --> 02:06:00.872]  They live in a world of compromise and the angles, and trying to figure out how they best advance themselves.
[02:06:00.912 --> 02:06:10.222]  And they may love America, and they may not like communism, but at the end of the day though, they keep dialing back who they are, and that becomes who you are.
[02:06:10.583 --> 02:06:12.365]  I'm not dialing anything back.
[02:06:17.423 --> 02:06:24.845]  And so we put out the ultimate bombshell that they are premeditatedly inflating COVID-19 infections 15 times at least.
[02:06:26.966 --> 02:06:30.147]  And it's only got 120,000 views in 12 hours.
[02:06:33.788 --> 02:06:35.108]  Thank God we've got our own platform.
[02:06:35.148 --> 02:06:36.969]  Thank God the supporters supported us.
[02:06:37.169 --> 02:06:38.289]  They're the great people out there.
[02:06:38.649 --> 02:06:42.010]  Black, white, male, female, Hispanic, Asian, you name it.
[02:06:42.471 --> 02:06:43.571]  You care about freedom, I love you.
[02:06:45.618 --> 02:06:49.199]  I don't judge you if you're gay, straight, whatever it is, as long as you love justice and don't want to screw kids.
[02:06:50.859 --> 02:06:54.260]  But imagine we build our own network knowing this is coming.
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:07:05.323]  What we knew was coming happens, and then we've got the Excalibur weapon to absolutely end this that's going to kill hundreds of millions of people in the aggregate.
[02:07:06.484 --> 02:07:15.146]  And I literally sent out a message to over 50 prominent people, and six of them retweeted us, and the others all pissed down their legs to Jack Dorsey.
[02:07:16.548 --> 02:07:37.054]  And to Facebook's leader, and to the leader of Google, and the leader of Apple, and just Tim, it's just like, it's an obscene thing to just watch almost everyone is a follower.
[02:07:37.995 --> 02:07:41.856]  Almost everyone gets off on never doing what's right.
[02:07:43.581 --> 02:07:45.422]  And they die all these incredible deaths.
[02:07:46.102 --> 02:07:51.203]  And so, let me tell you, all those names I list, they'll be completely banned in a month or two.
[02:07:52.564 --> 02:07:57.665]  But they'll hold on like a cicada to a tree when high wind comes till they blow away and then they have no effect.
[02:07:58.205 --> 02:07:59.986]  Because before they blow you away,
[02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:03.912]  They get you to compromise and sell out and give in to them.
[02:08:04.472 --> 02:08:07.154]  And then they get rid of you to scare whoever's left.
[02:08:07.594 --> 02:08:09.676]  And there's always more people being purged.
[02:08:10.256 --> 02:08:11.957]  Always more people being taken down.
[02:08:12.017 --> 02:08:13.538]  Always more people being destroyed.
[02:08:14.839 --> 02:08:19.982]  So that all of you run from your convictions and hope that you appease and say, I'm sorry.
[02:08:21.563 --> 02:08:23.344]  We sell tooth whitening toothpaste.
[02:08:24.025 --> 02:08:26.126]  I'm sorry we said we love America.
[02:08:26.847 --> 02:08:30.249]  I'm sorry that they'll pass over you.
[02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:37.015]  But all you've done is gotten them to identify you to come after you even that much stronger.
[02:08:38.816 --> 02:08:40.098]  But I'll tell listeners that care.
[02:08:41.783 --> 02:08:44.666]  And I'll tell people that don't want to roll over that I salute you and I thank you.
[02:08:44.686 --> 02:08:58.740]  And I'll tell you, we got products you need and you giving us money has kept us in attack formation and pissed off the most powerful people on this planet who would have already had me killed, but they know their own panopticon surveillance system would get them caught.
[02:08:59.441 --> 02:09:01.583]  They're trying to think around that plan right now and that's okay.
[02:09:02.464 --> 02:09:04.626]  I'm just telling you, with me, I'm the real deal.
[02:09:05.467 --> 02:09:07.451]  I could be a jerk, I could be everything, but I'm real.
[02:09:07.712 --> 02:09:10.116]  Let me tell you something, this universe, you're real, I'm real.
[02:09:10.337 --> 02:09:12.461]  You know it in your gut, you can feel it and you know it.
[02:09:12.861 --> 02:09:14.665]  Well, I need money to prosecute this war.
[02:09:14.685 --> 02:09:15.627]  I already mortgaged my house.
[02:09:16.656 --> 02:09:17.216]  I'm happy to do it.
[02:09:17.236 --> 02:09:19.537]  I don't give a frat's ass about stuff.
[02:09:20.078 --> 02:09:23.439]  I care about blood, genetics, humans, the future.
[02:09:23.619 --> 02:09:26.120]  And I tell you, we got products you need that you should get.
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:33.944]  And the metaphysical nature of buying into this and getting products you need and supporting us by word of mouth and prayer, all those things are the trifecta.
[02:09:34.664 --> 02:09:41.127]  Spiritual support, financial support, word of mouth, you bring those three things together, everything comes in threes, it changes the world.
[02:09:41.807 --> 02:09:44.108]  I could have done this without all your support, without this crew.
[02:09:44.388 --> 02:09:45.188]  We all do this together.
[02:09:45.408 --> 02:09:48.389]  For the July special, right now, Basel beats back at stock 50% off.
[02:09:48.729 --> 02:09:50.129]  Bodies, level 2 at 405% off.
[02:09:50.349 --> 02:09:51.349]  DNA, 45% off.
[02:09:51.389 --> 02:09:52.210]  Winter, 70% off.
[02:09:52.610 --> 02:09:52.950]  All of it.
[02:09:53.010 --> 02:09:54.470]  Ultra 12, it's all there.
[02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:55.690]  Free shipping, store-wide.
[02:09:56.050 --> 02:09:57.091]  Double Patriot points.
[02:09:57.231 --> 02:09:58.871]  Almost forgot to say that.
[02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:04.953]  I'll do a few more minutes and finish up, then our guest host, when I'm ready to knock it out of the park, takes over.
[02:10:05.153 --> 02:10:05.833]  We'll be right back.
[02:10:05.853 --> 02:10:06.253]  Stay with us.
[02:10:08.354 --> 02:10:12.596]  All right, so two years ago, when we first got totally banned with the beta test, people said, how are you taking it?
[02:10:12.636 --> 02:10:13.816]  And I said, well, not bad.
[02:10:13.957 --> 02:10:14.797]  It's for everybody else.
[02:10:14.857 --> 02:10:16.278]  I'm worried about all of us.
[02:10:17.638 --> 02:10:32.144]  And so now we put out the video, totally proving from the state of Texas, Homeland Security documents, NIH documents, that it's all a fraud, and that they're counting everybody that doesn't even have it as having it, and that anybody connected to someone that has COVID-19 they're saying is a new case.
[02:10:32.605 --> 02:10:33.665]  Wow, how huge is that?
[02:10:34.506 --> 02:10:37.527]  My phone is blowing up from family and from friends.
[02:10:38.834 --> 02:10:44.556]  Who on Facebook, on Twitter, on any platform, cannot send it out.
[02:10:45.976 --> 02:10:46.717]  They're just blocking it.
[02:10:48.217 --> 02:10:51.298]  Well, of course, they're blocking medical doctors that come out and expose it as a hoax.
[02:10:51.758 --> 02:10:53.319]  Cedars-Sinai, everybody else.
[02:10:53.719 --> 02:10:55.239]  That's why you've got to hammer them.
[02:10:55.339 --> 02:10:56.000]  They're weak.
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:58.260]  You don't go, oh, they're censoring us.
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:10:59.141]  I've got to give up.
[02:10:59.201 --> 02:11:00.101]  I don't want to get blocked.
[02:11:01.107 --> 02:11:04.428]  No, you've got to by word of mouth, by hand, however you can, get it out.
[02:11:05.129 --> 02:11:06.329]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:11:06.389 --> 02:11:10.971]  Pandemic, bombshell, CDC inflating COVID infection rates up to 16 times.
[02:11:12.111 --> 02:11:17.233]  Or the better headline would just be, Texas exposes CDC fraud.
[02:11:20.695 --> 02:11:23.276]  COVID-19 hoax implodes, Texas exposes fraud.
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:28.263]  CDC caught artificially inflating COVID-19 numbers.
[02:11:28.363 --> 02:11:30.344]  I mean, this is criminal!
[02:11:30.625 --> 02:11:38.312]  Like, everything else they did, and so many people I've talked to in the office and on the street go, well, Alex, I mean, they got caught in this fraud and that fraud.
[02:11:38.372 --> 02:11:39.693]  People with antibodies, they said, had it.
[02:11:39.713 --> 02:11:40.174]  Well, they didn't.
[02:11:42.081 --> 02:11:46.764]  But this is the actual documents of why it's skyrocketing right when this went into place.
[02:11:46.824 --> 02:11:47.664]  It's in the video.
[02:11:48.104 --> 02:11:50.525]  It's on InfoWars.com and Banned.video.
[02:11:50.686 --> 02:11:54.047]  We built our own servers, our own satellites, our own uplinks, our own crew.
[02:11:54.528 --> 02:11:56.248]  All of this, knowing this was coming.
[02:11:57.389 --> 02:12:02.051]  I was telling crews 10 years ago, we've got to build our own infrastructure, our own uplinks, our own systems.
[02:12:02.111 --> 02:12:02.952]  It's going to get shut down.
[02:12:03.272 --> 02:12:05.333]  We knew this was coming and thank God we're here.
[02:12:05.613 --> 02:12:08.815]  But if you don't get excited about it and share it, the enemy wins.
[02:12:09.923 --> 02:12:11.564]  Exclusive interview with Roger Stone.
[02:12:12.325 --> 02:12:14.326]  Exclusive breakdown of Fauci.
[02:12:16.027 --> 02:12:19.670]  It's all at Bandot Video and I'm so thankful for the viewers and listeners.
[02:12:20.070 --> 02:12:26.915]  I'm so thankful that out of the whole universe of BS and garbage and propaganda that you decided to tune in here and you decided to support us.
[02:12:26.995 --> 02:12:27.496]  Thank you!
[02:12:27.516 --> 02:12:32.740]  I'm just saying, everything we do, all our guests are important, but this...
[02:12:34.929 --> 02:12:36.690]  And the other reports, because I'm not that good.
[02:12:36.730 --> 02:12:37.570]  Rob's not that good.
[02:12:38.110 --> 02:12:38.930]  I've asked Owens-Troyer.
[02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:40.011]  I've asked Savannah Hernandez.
[02:12:40.051 --> 02:12:40.931]  I've asked Paul Watson.
[02:12:41.371 --> 02:12:42.612]  I've asked Steve Watson, his brother.
[02:12:43.752 --> 02:12:44.712]  I've asked Millie Weaver.
[02:12:44.773 --> 02:12:45.813]  I've asked Kaitlyn Bennett.
[02:12:45.873 --> 02:12:47.634]  I've asked everybody that works with us.
[02:12:48.054 --> 02:12:49.054]  Do your own report.
[02:12:49.414 --> 02:12:50.455]  Watch your own video.
[02:12:50.495 --> 02:12:51.535]  Look at your own documents.
[02:12:51.975 --> 02:12:54.016]  Just talk about this!
[02:12:55.643 --> 02:13:01.368]  They say in there what is admitted, but it's on video, that you're not even tested!
[02:13:01.448 --> 02:13:07.875]  If you have a runny nose, or a headache, or a cough, either one of those, you have it.
[02:13:08.435 --> 02:13:10.477]  And then 15 people around you have it.
[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:16.703]  This is like people barbecuing babies on national TV and nobody gets in trouble.
[02:13:18.595 --> 02:13:20.076]  This is just, oh, well, it's Fauci.
[02:13:20.116 --> 02:13:21.036]  Well, he's a scientist.
[02:13:21.076 --> 02:13:25.318]  Well, as soon as he got done with his speech the other day on TV, he takes the mask off.
[02:13:25.418 --> 02:13:26.279]  It's a hoax.
[02:13:26.859 --> 02:13:27.680]  It's a fraud.
[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:29.040]  And I know you know that.
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:31.942]  So the point is, get it out to other people.
[02:13:31.982 --> 02:13:42.607]  We built a platform for a time like this so the jerk murderers that run death camps in China, like Apple and Google, could not stop you at the critical juncture getting the video out!
[02:13:45.336 --> 02:13:46.297]  So am I wound up?
[02:13:46.377 --> 02:13:50.240]  Damn right I am, because this is a serious time to be alive.
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:14:01.308]  So I thank you, and I salute you, and I beg you, your email list, your everything, your call people, send them the link, text message it, get around the enemy, get this out!
[02:14:01.789 --> 02:14:03.190]  Stop the hoax!
[02:14:04.571 --> 02:14:08.594]  And when you decide to get angry, nothing in the world can stop you, and we've been doing it.
[02:14:10.299 --> 02:14:16.562]  All those doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and virologists who'd have 10, 15, 20 million views on YouTube or Facebook will get banned.
[02:14:16.822 --> 02:14:17.502]  We posted them.
[02:14:17.703 --> 02:14:18.943]  Some of them have 3, 4 million views.
[02:14:18.963 --> 02:14:19.483]  That's great!
[02:14:21.424 --> 02:14:22.745]  But we need way more than that!
[02:14:25.366 --> 02:14:27.027]  Everybody knows they're suppressing the truth.
[02:14:27.067 --> 02:14:30.749]  And you just tell people, here's the truth, pass it forward, and we will defeat the enemy.
[02:14:31.547 --> 02:14:32.888]  This is a great test of humanity.
[02:14:32.928 --> 02:14:37.371]  Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com takes over straight ahead.
[02:14:37.411 --> 02:14:40.053]  And Owen Schroyer with the war room!
[02:14:40.593 --> 02:14:42.335]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:14:42.395 --> 02:14:43.175]  I salute the crew.
[02:14:43.496 --> 02:14:45.177]  I salute the activists, listeners, and viewers.
[02:14:45.877 --> 02:14:47.799]  And I end my segment of this transmission.
[02:14:47.819 --> 02:14:50.821]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow with a Wednesday's transmission.
[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:54.121]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:54.221 --> 02:14:57.042]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:14:57.542 --> 02:15:05.904]  You know, I thought we would pick up where I left off last week with Alex in our grad class, we'll call it, on the writings of the elite.
[02:15:06.024 --> 02:15:07.565]  So there's going to be a multiple choice.
[02:15:07.585 --> 02:15:09.386]  You're going to have some homework.
[02:15:09.926 --> 02:15:10.466]  Pay attention.
[02:15:10.486 --> 02:15:11.746]  You're going to learn some stuff.
[02:15:12.447 --> 02:15:14.887]  Let's go to a clip that I was reminded of this week.
[02:15:15.047 --> 02:15:16.908]  Many of you have probably seen this clip, but
[02:15:17.617 --> 02:15:25.321]  I think this is really illustrative for showing the whole paradigm here, where we are now, what's going on, why the news is so baloney-filled.
[02:15:25.341 --> 02:15:27.242]  Let's play that clip and you'll see what I mean.
[02:15:27.262 --> 02:15:31.064]  Hi, I'm Fox San Antonio's Jessica Hedley.
[02:15:31.224 --> 02:15:32.004]  And I'm Ryan Wolf.
[02:15:32.124 --> 02:15:35.686]  Our greatest responsibility is to serve our Treasure Valley communities.
[02:15:35.906 --> 02:15:37.687]  The El Paso, Las Cruces communities.
[02:15:37.867 --> 02:15:39.248]  Eastern Iowa communities.
[02:15:39.408 --> 02:15:40.428]  Mid-Michigan communities.
[02:15:40.769 --> 02:15:45.451]  We are extremely proud of the quality, balanced journalism that CBS 4 News produces.
[02:15:46.031 --> 02:15:51.997]  But... We are concerned about the trouble that's making irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country.
[02:15:52.137 --> 02:15:53.138]  Plaguing our country.
[02:15:53.379 --> 02:15:57.963]  The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.
[02:15:58.344 --> 02:16:03.549]  More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first.
[02:16:03.789 --> 02:16:08.433]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[02:16:08.473 --> 02:16:11.875]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[02:16:32.731 --> 02:16:34.772]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[02:16:54.775 --> 02:16:56.877]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[02:16:57.197 --> 02:16:59.439]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[02:17:00.019 --> 02:17:02.321]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[02:17:02.541 --> 02:17:04.483]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[02:17:04.823 --> 02:17:07.045]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[02:17:10.128 --> 02:17:11.729]  What an amazing coincidence!
[02:17:11.829 --> 02:17:13.931]  Everybody just happened to say the same thing.
[02:17:13.971 --> 02:17:16.113]  I'm sure that was totally organic.
[02:17:16.653 --> 02:17:19.035]  Nothing weird or strange about that at all, right?
[02:17:19.095 --> 02:17:20.837]  Now, let's think about something here.
[02:17:22.248 --> 02:17:36.259]  If the Hamburglar and Ronald McDonald and Bill Cosby all got together and they sat down and they said, let's write out a plan of how we're going to rob the local convenience store of Pudding Pops, right?
[02:17:36.279 --> 02:17:38.941]  They sat down, they drew it up, right?
[02:17:38.961 --> 02:17:48.529]  Bill Cosby drew it up and then you found that plan and you went to the convenience store guy and you said, Bill Cosby and the Hamburglar
[02:17:49.588 --> 02:17:58.592]  And the Cookie Monster, they're all coming to rob your Pudding Pops, right?
[02:17:59.292 --> 02:18:05.595]  You would think right away that you had discovered a plot and you would try them all and they would go to jail, right?
[02:18:05.915 --> 02:18:10.517]  If so, plots can be public for a century, however,
[02:18:12.014 --> 02:18:13.715]  And nobody goes to jail, nobody gets in trouble.
[02:18:14.055 --> 02:18:20.118]  This is amazing, this is what blows my mind, that we can have books a century old.
[02:18:21.579 --> 02:18:25.301]  Right, let's go back to, let's do our first example here.
[02:18:25.321 --> 02:18:28.082]  Edward Bernays, Propaganda, 1928.
[02:18:28.322 --> 02:18:31.704]  In 1928, how does this book start out?
[02:18:32.144 --> 02:18:37.607]  He says, we are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, not by pudding puffs.
[02:18:38.490 --> 02:18:43.754]  But by ideas that are suggested largely by men that we have never heard of.
[02:18:45.635 --> 02:18:50.378]  This is the logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized.
[02:18:51.499 --> 02:18:54.421]  You see, and he goes on to talk about our invisible governors.
[02:18:54.501 --> 02:18:56.503]  Who makes up this invisible government?
[02:18:56.623 --> 02:18:56.863]  What?
[02:18:57.463 --> 02:18:58.644]  Where have we heard that term before?
[02:18:58.684 --> 02:19:01.166]  Well, in the last four years, we've heard it quite a bit, haven't we?
[02:19:01.606 --> 02:19:02.747]  This is 1928, right?
[02:19:04.208 --> 02:19:06.230]  Now, why is Bernays really matter?
[02:19:06.250 --> 02:19:08.071]  He's the father of modern propaganda.
[02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:11.852]  And he was in a circle of men, right?
[02:19:11.912 --> 02:19:15.716]  He actually renamed the War Department to the Defense Department.
[02:19:15.856 --> 02:19:17.617]  Okay, so this is not a conspiracy book.
[02:19:17.658 --> 02:19:18.699]  This is not a nobody.
[02:19:18.719 --> 02:19:20.821]  This is the father of modern propaganda.
[02:19:20.841 --> 02:19:22.422]  And where does propaganda come from?
[02:19:23.003 --> 02:19:25.846]  It comes out of military operations.
[02:19:26.467 --> 02:19:31.792]  And then it moves directly into advertising and media, right?
[02:19:32.253 --> 02:19:43.000]  The second chapter of the book, page 61, he says this invisible government is made up of people, for example, who used to be in the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA.
[02:19:43.581 --> 02:19:52.867]  So they took all those techniques and tactics and tricks that they learned in the war theater and brought it over into the network news media.
[02:19:53.387 --> 02:19:57.390]  Yes, the heads of the three main networks, they were all from the OSS.
[02:19:59.286 --> 02:20:00.087]  Sarnoff, right?
[02:20:00.708 --> 02:20:02.250]  Walter Lippmann, right?
[02:20:02.991 --> 02:20:03.933]  The ad agency.
[02:20:04.674 --> 02:20:09.982]  So we start to realize that we have for a long time been under a coordinated plan.
[02:20:10.022 --> 02:20:10.783]  Now again, remember, if
[02:20:12.597 --> 02:20:20.020]  We found the coordinated plans, and we were to look into who wrote it, and they made it public, right?
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:22.401]  This is not like you discovered Bill Cosby's secret.
[02:20:22.621 --> 02:20:25.942]  You actually found it plastered on the wall all around.
[02:20:26.062 --> 02:20:33.025]  Every McDonald's has the plan up, right, of Bill Cosby's going to rob all the Pudding Pops, and yet no one gets in trouble.
[02:20:35.306 --> 02:20:35.706]  So let's move
[02:20:36.930 --> 02:20:37.931]  Let's move backwards.
[02:20:37.971 --> 02:20:39.352]  Let's go back in time a little bit.
[02:20:39.372 --> 02:20:40.453]  You say, well, where does this come from?
[02:20:40.653 --> 02:20:41.333]  This is crazy.
[02:20:41.373 --> 02:20:42.674]  I've never heard anything like this.
[02:20:42.754 --> 02:20:49.138]  Well, you've heard probably me or many other people mention that famous, big, fat, boring book, Tragedy and Hope.
[02:20:49.178 --> 02:20:50.339]  And let me tell you, it is boring.
[02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:53.041]  It is a nightmare to read that giant book.
[02:20:53.601 --> 02:21:04.769]  But our friend, Dr. Quigley, who was an apologist for this whole plan, well, he wrote a much smaller book that says everything and more called The Anglo-American Establishment.
[02:21:06.112 --> 02:21:10.695]  And again, I will warn you, this book is also very boring, but it's so revelatory.
[02:21:11.515 --> 02:21:20.601]  And he begins this book by saying that there was a plan devised out of the British Empire as the British Empire sort of waned in its power and influence.
[02:21:21.161 --> 02:21:24.763]  There was a plan devised by a group called the Elect.
[02:21:25.964 --> 02:21:29.066]  It almost sounds like some kind of Gnostic secret society, right?
[02:21:29.106 --> 02:21:31.868]  The Elect, the chosen of
[02:21:32.697 --> 02:21:42.139]  These elite British lords, Lord Milner, Lord Stead, Lord Brett, Cecil Rhodes, who ironically, didn't he just get something torn down of his?
[02:21:43.539 --> 02:21:46.960]  Which is ironic because the revolution, you see, eats itself, right?
[02:21:46.980 --> 02:21:53.081]  So here's the father of, in many ways, the modern world, in the sense of the round table groups and all that.
[02:21:53.221 --> 02:21:54.442]  He gets his statue torn down.
[02:21:57.068 --> 02:21:57.968]  Who's at the head of this?
[02:21:58.048 --> 02:22:00.209]  Well, we've got all these elite families.
[02:22:00.509 --> 02:22:04.290]  We've got Lord Rothschild here, according to Quigley, on page 39.
[02:22:04.831 --> 02:22:07.331]  We've got Rhodes, as I said, Milner.
[02:22:07.832 --> 02:22:11.153]  And then he said we've got a circle of initiates around them.
[02:22:12.013 --> 02:22:13.413]  It's called the Circle of Initiates.
[02:22:14.094 --> 02:22:16.434]  One of those was a famous Cardinal, Cardinal Manning.
[02:22:17.375 --> 02:22:22.036]  Others were people like William Booth, or General Booth of the Salvation Army.
[02:22:22.977 --> 02:22:24.237]  And then a whole host
[02:22:25.339 --> 02:22:28.940]  Of professors, academic idiots, right?
[02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:34.142]  Liberal professors who thought they were going to bring in this great commonwealth of God.
[02:22:34.222 --> 02:22:35.262]  This is what they called it, right?
[02:22:35.282 --> 02:22:37.123]  The commonwealth of God, initially.
[02:22:37.843 --> 02:22:43.665]  And the way that they decided that they would have to do this was to infiltrate and control all the areas of society.
[02:22:45.125 --> 02:22:45.505]  Literally.
[02:22:46.666 --> 02:22:47.526]  Pages 64, 65.
[02:22:47.686 --> 02:22:52.687]  It's all about controlling every aspect of man's life.
[02:22:52.887 --> 02:22:54.368]  Full spectrum dominance.
[02:22:55.615 --> 02:22:57.657]  To use the term of William Engdahl, right?
[02:22:58.238 --> 02:22:59.079]  Great book, by the way.
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:04.644]  Now, they said we'd have to get rid of this older British imperial notion, right?
[02:23:04.684 --> 02:23:09.009]  Because that's got a lot of bad publicity surrounding it, you know, slavery, this kind of stuff.
[02:23:09.029 --> 02:23:14.234]  So let's rebrand this as a secular technocratic order.
[02:23:15.242 --> 02:23:22.424]  And we will use the philosophy and propaganda of actually somebody who predates Bernays as a father of propaganda.
[02:23:22.444 --> 02:23:25.865]  He's probably the father of the modern world in many ways, Mr. H.G.
[02:23:25.905 --> 02:23:26.465]  Wells himself.
[02:23:28.125 --> 02:23:28.265]  H.G.
[02:23:28.305 --> 02:23:31.906]  Wells said, we're going to have to just get rid of all of the old ways of doing things.
[02:23:32.566 --> 02:23:40.708]  Even this older British imperial notion will have to cave into a world federation of a secular technocratic order.
[02:23:42.557 --> 02:23:47.140]  Where every area of life is ruled by managerial technocrats.
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:50.442]  What's the last chapter of Bernays book say?
[02:23:50.962 --> 02:23:56.365]  The last chapter says that the future is a managerial technocratic society.
[02:23:57.926 --> 02:24:02.089]  Let's move on to the next in our lecture here.
[02:24:02.949 --> 02:24:04.170]  More technocracy.
[02:24:05.231 --> 02:24:07.152]  Now you probably heard about Mr. Salk.
[02:24:07.172 --> 02:24:08.753]  He's known for being the father of
[02:24:10.018 --> 02:24:11.179]  Armstabbies, right?
[02:24:11.799 --> 02:24:16.602]  And Mr. Salk wrote a famous book called The Survival of the Wisest.
[02:24:17.703 --> 02:24:19.985]  When we get back from the break, I'm going to tell you more about that.
[02:24:20.125 --> 02:24:23.907]  But you are listening to, watching The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:24.007 --> 02:24:26.329]  I am Jay Dyer of jaysandalsos.com.
[02:24:27.049 --> 02:24:28.910]  When we come back, I'm going to tell you about Jonas Salk.
[02:24:28.930 --> 02:24:30.992]  I'm going to tell you about Jacques Attali.
[02:24:31.012 --> 02:24:32.112]  Do you know who that is?
[02:24:32.352 --> 02:24:33.653]  He's the Kissinger of France.
[02:24:33.673 --> 02:24:39.137]  Do you know there's a Kissinger of France who trained and raised the modern presidents?
[02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:41.031]  I'll tell you about that in a minute.
[02:24:41.752 --> 02:24:43.653]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:43.713 --> 02:24:46.295]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jaysandalsos.com.
[02:24:47.536 --> 02:25:00.727]  I was talking before the break about Jonas Salk, and there's a reason I'm going to go into Jonas Salk, because he wrote a couple books, one of which was extremely revealing, as I mentioned, called Survival of the Wisest.
[02:25:01.447 --> 02:25:03.109]  Now, why is this book so revelatory?
[02:25:03.149 --> 02:25:04.290]  Wasn't he a great hero of
[02:25:05.549 --> 02:25:16.074]  The arm stabbies and the butt stabbies, not necessarily if we read his books, which most people don't do because he's actually out of print, very rare books, but I tracked them down.
[02:25:17.095 --> 02:25:23.277]  And I was blown away by what I read because Mr. Salk is very candid about what he was really up to.
[02:25:23.658 --> 02:25:33.282]  You see, he says that since life is merely a random mutation, there's nothing wrong with randomly mutating the lives that exist, quite literally.
[02:25:34.019 --> 02:25:59.641]  The survival of the wisest is really the continuation of this radical social Darwinian, neo-Darwinian scheme that the technocratic priest class, the science class, right, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, these weirdos, these creeper-deepers, they're going to be the ones who can decide who lives and who dies, who gets what in the future, who has a right to have kids, this kind of stuff.
[02:25:59.681 --> 02:26:02.143]  But it gets even crazier than that, because
[02:26:02.893 --> 02:26:05.215]  Salk tells us what his real religious views are.
[02:26:05.895 --> 02:26:06.696]  Yes, religious views.
[02:26:06.716 --> 02:26:09.598]  Now, you would think he's a scientist, he's probably an atheist.
[02:26:10.058 --> 02:26:10.458]  No, no, no.
[02:26:10.518 --> 02:26:13.921]  He says that God is actually nature as a whole.
[02:26:14.641 --> 02:26:25.789]  And nature as a whole is in this constant flux process, and since it's in this constant meaningless flux process, it's up to the scientific priest class to commandeer evolution
[02:26:26.425 --> 02:26:29.886]  And do whatever's necessary for the survival of the species.
[02:26:29.946 --> 02:26:31.966]  Now, who does he, is he talking, who's the species?
[02:26:32.086 --> 02:26:33.867]  Well, it's not every man, okay?
[02:26:34.207 --> 02:26:38.468]  Because to him, anybody below a certain IQ range is not a man.
[02:26:38.508 --> 02:26:41.448]  You're not, you don't have a soul, you don't, you're not really an entity.
[02:26:41.468 --> 02:26:47.830]  You're just kind of this, this random, you know, pimple on Gaia's breasts, right?
[02:26:47.890 --> 02:26:49.570]  So, you can be dispensed with.
[02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:53.751]  But instead, he says, what we need to do is mutate man.
[02:26:55.356 --> 02:27:01.638]  We, like toxic Avenger-level mad scientists, we need to mutate man into becoming more than man.
[02:27:02.478 --> 02:27:03.378]  Post-man.
[02:27:03.978 --> 02:27:04.138]  Right?
[02:27:04.198 --> 02:27:04.778]  Post-human.
[02:27:05.699 --> 02:27:13.740]  And he says that we will do this through all kinds of secret experimentation, injections, injunctions, diets.
[02:27:14.941 --> 02:27:15.301]  Literally.
[02:27:15.441 --> 02:27:16.341]  Pages 44 and 45.
[02:27:17.681 --> 02:27:19.982]  He says, because man is just a manimal.
[02:27:21.909 --> 02:27:22.709]  Isn't that a Muppet?
[02:27:23.209 --> 02:27:23.590]  Manimal?
[02:27:23.610 --> 02:27:24.330]  I don't know.
[02:27:24.930 --> 02:27:34.693]  But he says that this mystical evolutionary process can be controlled and can be commandeered by the scientific priest class.
[02:27:34.733 --> 02:27:42.436]  So there you have the, he literally says death is just as holy and pure as life.
[02:27:42.676 --> 02:27:49.138]  He says there are two complementary necessary forces, they're flip sides of the same coin, a literally agnostic Luciferian perspective.
[02:27:50.043 --> 02:28:00.027]  And he says that since death needs life, and since life needs death, there's absolutely nothing wrong with mad scientists just commandeering and injecting death for the purpose of mutating the species.
[02:28:00.987 --> 02:28:02.868]  But, I mean, this guy is off the charts.
[02:28:02.908 --> 02:28:03.908]  Like, he doesn't stop there.
[02:28:03.948 --> 02:28:07.069]  He goes on to say that we can actually just engineer mass death.
[02:28:07.109 --> 02:28:11.031]  We can engineer experimentation on
[02:28:13.002 --> 02:28:13.843]  Yes, he says that.
[02:28:14.023 --> 02:28:15.544]  And who does he say is the enemy?
[02:28:15.844 --> 02:28:19.908]  Who's the enemy of everybody in this great final revolution?
[02:28:20.668 --> 02:28:24.271]  Anybody with a traditional objective truth worldview.
[02:28:25.092 --> 02:28:27.214]  Anybody who believes that their position is correct.
[02:28:27.574 --> 02:28:28.555]  Anybody who's a Christian.
[02:28:28.615 --> 02:28:31.237]  Anybody who has a religious worldview where you believe in objective truth.
[02:28:32.618 --> 02:28:33.419]  That's literally what he says.
[02:28:33.439 --> 02:28:37.562]  He says anybody who's dogmatic, quote-unquote, must go.
[02:28:37.662 --> 02:28:38.142]  You're out.
[02:28:38.263 --> 02:28:38.803]  Get out of here.
[02:28:38.983 --> 02:28:40.064]  Down the garbage chute.
[02:28:40.484 --> 02:28:41.165]  But now wait a minute.
[02:28:42.119 --> 02:28:45.180]  Who's more dogmatic than Mr. Salk?
[02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:45.740]  Nobody!
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:47.781]  He's like the most dogmatic guy.
[02:28:47.801 --> 02:28:49.962]  So it's self-refuting at a fundamental level.
[02:28:50.902 --> 02:28:52.302]  But that's the reality here.
[02:28:52.342 --> 02:28:57.904]  And I think that when I show people that book, when I show people this stuff, most people have a really hard time processing it.
[02:28:58.104 --> 02:29:05.827]  They can't fathom that you would have this open plan, that it would be that open, even though H.G.
[02:29:05.847 --> 02:29:09.368]  Wells wrote a book called The Open Conspiracy, saying, here's what I'm going to do openly.
[02:29:10.197 --> 02:29:13.179]  Not just him, but him and everybody else in his cadre.
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:17.743]  But what I'm trying to show you is that from a hundred years ago, it's the same plan.
[02:29:18.584 --> 02:29:19.224]  It's co-ordered.
[02:29:19.284 --> 02:29:24.488]  It's the same plan from then, and older than that even, up until now.
[02:29:25.709 --> 02:29:26.870]  There's no divergence.
[02:29:27.351 --> 02:29:28.852]  They have like their own Ten Commandments.
[02:29:28.872 --> 02:29:30.693]  You have to adhere to all the Ten Commandments.
[02:29:31.634 --> 02:29:34.757]  And as I was mentioning last time, there's a couple more characters we're going to get to here.
[02:29:34.777 --> 02:29:35.877]  We're going to get to
[02:29:37.691 --> 02:29:40.774]  Arthur Kessler, and then we're going to mention Mr. Attali.
[02:29:41.996 --> 02:29:47.221]  Now, we've moved from older, you know, British Empire period up to the 20s.
[02:29:47.262 --> 02:29:49.063]  We've looked at guys in the 650s and 60s.
[02:29:49.103 --> 02:29:52.147]  Let's look at another person in the 60s period.
[02:29:52.808 --> 02:29:54.670]  Mr. Arthur Kessler, Ghost in the Machine.
[02:29:55.450 --> 02:29:57.673]  He's another important figure that everybody overlooks.
[02:29:57.813 --> 02:29:58.674]  People forget this guy.
[02:29:59.614 --> 02:30:04.377]  But he was crucial to the philosophy of the global elite.
[02:30:04.417 --> 02:30:08.460]  In fact, many of the modern-day global elite will cite this book.
[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:14.064]  They'll cite him and his philosophy of how we're all part of this generic collective that's evolving.
[02:30:15.705 --> 02:30:24.652]  The perennial philosophy, if you don't know, Huxley has a book called The Perennial Philosophy where he says, we're all part of this giant glob and we're all just evolving to be the Godhead.
[02:30:24.872 --> 02:30:27.894]  We're going to evolve to become the Godhead through technology.
[02:30:29.016 --> 02:30:33.118]  But before we get to that, let's look at this fascinating chapter on the Thuggee.
[02:30:34.079 --> 02:30:36.220]  Yes, remember Temple of Doom?
[02:30:39.161 --> 02:30:40.001]  Kalima!
[02:30:40.442 --> 02:30:41.762]  Kalima Shakti!
[02:30:41.822 --> 02:30:42.022]  Right?
[02:30:42.723 --> 02:30:44.363]  Everybody remembers Temple of Doom.
[02:30:44.584 --> 02:30:47.925]  These guys love Temple of Doom, in the real sense of the Thuggee.
[02:30:48.425 --> 02:30:55.569]  In fact, he has a whole section on the Thuggee, and he says, you know, the Thuggee represent this older, this is page 236, this older idea of man
[02:30:58.323 --> 02:31:06.985]  Evolving and the fittest amongst men in the ancient world obviously just ate other men, right?
[02:31:07.365 --> 02:31:13.526]  They were cannibalistic and yeah, I mean it might sound a little taboo to us today, but really it's not that bad.
[02:31:13.606 --> 02:31:15.687]  I mean it's just part of the evolutionary process, right?
[02:31:15.707 --> 02:31:19.648]  I mean the predators eat the prey and that's just natural, you see.
[02:31:20.588 --> 02:31:21.128]  And so he says,
[02:31:21.843 --> 02:31:29.107]  There's absolutely nothing wrong with the human sacrifice cannibalism cults of the ancient world, the Aztecs, etc.
[02:31:29.847 --> 02:31:31.108]  It was purely natural.
[02:31:31.188 --> 02:31:32.369]  And by the way, it was noble.
[02:31:32.969 --> 02:31:34.090]  The nobility ate people.
[02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:39.453]  Are you gonna say that all the nobility were bad because they were chomping down on their cousins and their brothers?
[02:31:39.493 --> 02:31:40.713]  No, not gonna say that.
[02:31:41.174 --> 02:31:42.034]  That would be bigoted.
[02:31:42.494 --> 02:31:43.175]  Can't be bigots.
[02:31:44.215 --> 02:31:44.976]  Don't be a bigot.
[02:31:45.736 --> 02:31:47.497]  Eat your cousin or you're a bigot.
[02:31:49.688 --> 02:31:55.651]  And so he says this sacrifice religion actually was what propelled man's evolution.
[02:31:56.291 --> 02:31:58.772]  It propelled man's evolution to the next phase.
[02:31:58.853 --> 02:32:00.493]  And he says that now in our day, guess what?
[02:32:00.513 --> 02:32:03.435]  This all got to come back for us to go into the next phase.
[02:32:03.815 --> 02:32:04.675]  We got to go into the next phase.
[02:32:04.715 --> 02:32:05.316]  I'm not kidding.
[02:32:05.336 --> 02:32:07.036]  You think this, oh, that's crazy.
[02:32:07.056 --> 02:32:11.018]  That's because I would never be talking about eating people and cannibalism.
[02:32:11.058 --> 02:32:12.039]  That's crazy.
[02:32:12.099 --> 02:32:13.660]  No, really, really.
[02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:16.161]  Is that the four of the last four or five years?
[02:32:16.321 --> 02:32:18.262]  Has that shown you how crazy things are?
[02:32:19.122 --> 02:32:20.723]  Does this really sound that crazy now?
[02:32:22.505 --> 02:32:27.469]  He says, look, at the end of the book, he says, we're in a crisis.
[02:32:27.689 --> 02:32:32.974]  We are in danger because the population is getting too big, right?
[02:32:33.194 --> 02:32:35.436]  Mother Gaia, we're all in the back of some giant turtle.
[02:32:35.696 --> 02:32:41.981]  This turtle is going to flip over unless we kill everybody except for our little precious cult.
[02:32:42.662 --> 02:32:45.844]  And by the way, if everybody in the cult is a bunch of humans, they're just going to be eating each other.
[02:32:45.904 --> 02:32:46.545]  This is crazy.
[02:32:47.165 --> 02:32:47.806]  This is madness.
[02:32:49.335 --> 02:32:52.277]  But what it actually shows is that we are in a spiritual battle, right?
[02:32:53.338 --> 02:33:04.307]  And that's why he says death is just one of the natural processes that we must commandeer to get rid of the evolutionary freaks of nature, which are man himself, right?
[02:33:04.467 --> 02:33:08.790]  Man is an evolutionary freak of nature, he says on page 330.
[02:33:08.970 --> 02:33:12.553]  He says that death and disease are therefore good.
[02:33:13.547 --> 02:33:14.507]  More on that when we come back.
[02:33:14.967 --> 02:33:16.648]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.748 --> 02:33:18.689]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:33:18.729 --> 02:33:24.210]  If you want to get my books, you can go to my shop at the website, jaysonalsys.com.
[02:33:24.250 --> 02:33:25.090]  You'll see a shop there.
[02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:27.351]  You can also subscribe to my archive.
[02:33:27.371 --> 02:33:32.673]  You get access to years of lectures on the topics that you're hearing today.
[02:33:32.693 --> 02:33:37.634]  A lot of people don't have time to read these massive, boring tones, and I don't blame you.
[02:33:37.834 --> 02:33:38.894]  And so that's what I do for you.
[02:33:38.914 --> 02:33:40.815]  I read these for you, and then I distill them.
[02:33:41.738 --> 02:33:45.279]  Into spastic entertaining presentations.
[02:33:45.899 --> 02:34:08.683]  I was mentioning mr. Kessler and Finishing up with him Kessler says look it's time to Utilize mass mind control on the population is literally what he says on pages 332 33 he says that mass mind control as a result of the CIA sponsored conferences in the 60s at the University of California of San Francisco Medical Center and
[02:34:09.838 --> 02:34:18.164]  Holger Heiden, by the way, who I covered in my book, at this conference, they talked about how they could use mass media for mind control.
[02:34:18.765 --> 02:34:22.067]  They talked about how they could manipulate RNA and DNA.
[02:34:22.788 --> 02:34:24.469]  Yes, back in the 60s, right?
[02:34:24.509 --> 02:34:25.490]  Kessler wrote about this.
[02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:34.716]  He says that we can increase suggestibility through the mass media and at the same time we can go in and manipulate people's RNA and DNA.
[02:34:35.337 --> 02:34:36.998]  He says we'll use binary weapons
[02:34:37.916 --> 02:34:39.157]  That's what he says on 334.
[02:34:39.898 --> 02:34:44.342]  And that this will all be combined with the poison in the tap water.
[02:34:44.742 --> 02:34:46.163]  Yes, poison in the tap water.
[02:34:47.764 --> 02:34:55.111]  All this stuff that you've heard people talking about, John P. Holdren, the science czar under Obama, Paul Ehrlich, right?
[02:34:56.052 --> 02:34:59.114]  It's all going back to 50s, 60s, all the way back to Bertrand Russell.
[02:34:59.134 --> 02:35:02.317]  But I'm just showing you the continuity through the decades of this unified plan.
[02:35:03.303 --> 02:35:16.089]  He says that Big Pharma will have to take a lead role in this, in this first phase, he says, back in the 60s, of beginning to promote large-scale pharmaceuticals and that Brave New World mindset.
[02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:19.231]  And he says, eventually, we're just going to have to give everybody a pill.
[02:35:19.651 --> 02:35:20.752]  Everybody will have their Soma.
[02:35:21.652 --> 02:35:24.334]  And he says the whole of the tap water will be poisoned.
[02:35:24.934 --> 02:35:26.014]  Literally, that's the end of the book.
[02:35:26.515 --> 02:35:29.016]  And he says, this will all be alchemy.
[02:35:29.916 --> 02:35:31.077]  Literally, he says alchemy.
[02:35:31.618 --> 02:35:33.739]  For the process of transhumanism.
[02:35:34.539 --> 02:35:42.722]  So they want this mass die-off, this mass kill-off, before transitioning into the next phase of the post-human era.
[02:35:44.002 --> 02:35:49.424]  Now, I mentioned earlier, Mr. President Henry Kissinger, I would like one baguette.
[02:35:49.764 --> 02:35:52.145]  Give me one baguette made of dead babies from France.
[02:35:52.985 --> 02:35:54.266]  Who is the Kissinger of France?
[02:35:55.186 --> 02:35:56.826]  Jean-Cathalie, right?
[02:35:57.987 --> 02:36:01.268]  He's the brains behind some of the recent presidents of France.
[02:36:02.282 --> 02:36:03.783]  And he wrote a really interesting book.
[02:36:03.883 --> 02:36:05.584]  Let's fast forward up to 2006.
[02:36:06.505 --> 02:36:10.527]  Mr. Attali wrote a book called Brief History of the Future.
[02:36:10.968 --> 02:36:13.529]  This is an overlooked global elite book.
[02:36:13.690 --> 02:36:14.630]  People forget this guy.
[02:36:14.670 --> 02:36:17.572]  They forget that he wrote everything in his book.
[02:36:19.473 --> 02:36:21.595]  And the first four or five chapters are really boring.
[02:36:21.655 --> 02:36:23.156]  I'm going to breeze past those.
[02:36:23.196 --> 02:36:26.338]  But basically, he just says, look, all of history is evolving to
[02:36:27.481 --> 02:36:29.522]  Let's be a collective, right?
[02:36:29.743 --> 02:36:31.744]  In the ancient times, you had these empires.
[02:36:31.764 --> 02:36:34.185]  Man came out of muck, soup, whatever.
[02:36:34.606 --> 02:36:40.710]  Now we've got these empires, and they've given way to the final empire of global democracy.
[02:36:40.910 --> 02:36:42.051]  We hear this term all the time.
[02:36:42.651 --> 02:36:44.112]  We're a republic, we're not a democracy.
[02:36:44.152 --> 02:36:51.377]  But regardless, as the news clip at the beginning said, this democracy now has to give way to more freedom?
[02:36:51.537 --> 02:36:53.678]  No, to a planetary empire.
[02:36:54.159 --> 02:36:54.379]  What?
[02:36:54.999 --> 02:36:56.220]  A planetary empire.
[02:36:56.792 --> 02:37:18.665]  Yes, he says by 2040, he says we're going to have little assistant robots that will be rolling around your house, little bitch bots, bitching you around, doing who knows what, being your companion perhaps, going around grabbing butts, little gross perv robots running everything in your household.
[02:37:19.426 --> 02:37:24.769]  Literally, he says every household will have one of these little bitch bots running around, bossing you around, telling you what to do.
[02:37:25.746 --> 02:37:28.086]  Telling you to clean your room, right?
[02:37:29.307 --> 02:37:29.987]  Because he won't do it.
[02:37:30.887 --> 02:37:31.907]  But he's going to teach your kids.
[02:37:31.927 --> 02:37:40.649]  And that's what he says, is these little robots, little bitch-bots rolling around, they're going to be preaching and teaching you everything that you'll know about the external world, right?
[02:37:41.289 --> 02:37:42.909]  This is beyond Skynet.
[02:37:42.949 --> 02:37:52.991]  This is not just, this is like, it's every dystopian story, they picked up the worst elements and said, let's make the mega dystopia, right?
[02:37:53.763 --> 02:37:56.104]  Imagine something worse than a Roomba.
[02:37:58.064 --> 02:38:00.485]  A little dictator Roomba, right?
[02:38:01.145 --> 02:38:05.106]  And he says these bots are going to control your perception of the external world.
[02:38:05.146 --> 02:38:09.327]  All of your education will come through your little house bot, your little coffin apartment bot.
[02:38:10.707 --> 02:38:12.828]  He says America has to go away, right?
[02:38:12.848 --> 02:38:13.908]  We've got to get rid of this stuff.
[02:38:14.248 --> 02:38:15.448]  This is the old thing.
[02:38:15.528 --> 02:38:16.569]  America's going away.
[02:38:16.729 --> 02:38:18.269]  That's old school.
[02:38:18.929 --> 02:38:21.370]  America, he says, and all nation states
[02:38:22.213 --> 02:38:24.234]  Have to be dismantled.
[02:38:25.335 --> 02:38:36.503]  Every nation state, every firewall has to be completely dismantled so that the giant global system can come into place and he calls it a global brain.
[02:38:37.324 --> 02:38:39.005]  In fact, he calls it a golem, right?
[02:38:39.045 --> 02:38:43.528]  If you remember the mystical story of the golem, this is this creature that can be created and it doesn't have a soul.
[02:38:44.609 --> 02:38:50.133]  It's given reality and it's controlled and he says that the whole world will be like this.
[02:38:50.845 --> 02:38:54.368]  Giant Gollum brain that everybody's jacked into, right?
[02:38:56.229 --> 02:38:57.850]  And that you will get your daily download.
[02:38:58.791 --> 02:39:01.753]  He says slavery will return, right?
[02:39:02.574 --> 02:39:09.359]  Yes, slavery will return, but it will be a slavery to the bots and to the giant AI global brain.
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:14.643]  And he says all of the things that you've seen rolling out in the last decade.
[02:39:14.683 --> 02:39:15.804]  Now, remember he wrote this in 2006 and he says that
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:23.106]  In the next few years, what you're going to see is the rollout of the importance of the cell phone.
[02:39:24.127 --> 02:39:25.769]  He says that's just one phase though, right?
[02:39:25.909 --> 02:39:31.376]  He says because what the cell phone would do would cause everybody to become rootless cosmopolitans.
[02:39:31.616 --> 02:39:34.880]  He says the cell phone would make everybody into nomadic losers.
[02:39:35.768 --> 02:39:42.610]  Where you would no longer be grounded and rooted in anything in terms of your heritage, in terms of your history, in terms of your background, your religious philosophy.
[02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:46.412]  He says, all that's going to be destroyed by the cell phone.
[02:39:46.872 --> 02:39:49.293]  He says, but that's just one phase, you see.
[02:39:49.533 --> 02:39:50.353]  That's going to go away.
[02:39:50.373 --> 02:39:57.195]  And what will give rise to this global culture will be a global pop culture.
[02:39:58.276 --> 02:40:00.477]  Spurts, sports ball, right?
[02:40:01.197 --> 02:40:01.657]  All of that.
[02:40:02.148 --> 02:40:03.889]  We'll be made global.
[02:40:04.450 --> 02:40:07.312]  They'll probably be Hunger Games type stuff on a global scale.
[02:40:07.332 --> 02:40:14.657]  He says, he intimates that there will be things like that, like Hunger Games style, you know, death race type stuff going on.
[02:40:15.157 --> 02:40:25.385]  And that what that will do is get everybody into a global mindset through the pop culture, through the sports, through the globalized, whatever the new version of Hollywood is going to be, you know, streaming services or whatever.
[02:40:25.405 --> 02:40:30.909]  And he says, we'll even take the churches, the churches, this is key,
[02:40:31.826 --> 02:40:41.168]  These big World Council churches, New Agey churches, we're going to co-opt all of those into being engines and arms of this global order.
[02:40:41.228 --> 02:40:48.130]  Remember, it's a full-spectrum dominance plan, so that means every area of life has to be converted over into this big plan.
[02:40:49.251 --> 02:40:52.832]  He says, especially the Catholic Church, he says this one is key because it's so big.
[02:40:52.852 --> 02:40:58.313]  He says we have to turn that into an engine of the global technocratic order.
[02:40:59.235 --> 02:41:01.397]  And that would go for the other religions as well, right?
[02:41:01.417 --> 02:41:03.478]  I'm not saying that the other religions are exempted.
[02:41:03.518 --> 02:41:09.542]  No, it's all, it's the subversion of all of the major religions to turn them into engines of this religion.
[02:41:11.043 --> 02:41:23.452]  And the greatest of the quotes in this book, now I'm not saying greatest in a good sense, I'm saying greatest in terms of importance, is he says there's a vanguard to this group and he calls it hyper-democracy.
[02:41:24.595 --> 02:41:29.397]  He's talking about the social justice, hyper-democracy, radical equalitarianism and all this stuff.
[02:41:30.037 --> 02:41:34.719]  He says the vanguard of this group are called the transhumanists.
[02:41:36.679 --> 02:41:45.543]  He says on page 260, he says that the transhumanists are a vanguard of the new world order and they're going to create a universal brotherhood.
[02:41:47.243 --> 02:41:48.484]  A universal brotherhood.
[02:41:49.424 --> 02:41:52.445]  He says among these transhumanists we could cite
[02:41:53.345 --> 02:42:00.153]  Bill and Melinda Gates, Mother Teresa, and many, many, many New Age weirdos.
[02:42:00.514 --> 02:42:03.658]  So he lists all these different weirdos, and he says,
[02:42:06.084 --> 02:42:11.667]  We'll have all of the world converted over to this thing, right?
[02:42:11.827 --> 02:42:11.667]  2050, 2030, 2050, 2100.
[02:42:12.547 --> 02:42:15.869]  These are the key actuary years, right?
[02:42:15.929 --> 02:42:17.950]  And by 2100, he says, there'll be all megacities.
[02:42:17.970 --> 02:42:20.692]  You'll all have to be, you know, piled into these cities.
[02:42:20.712 --> 02:42:23.053]  Have you seen that movie Code 46 with Tim Robbins?
[02:42:23.333 --> 02:42:24.413]  You've seen this, right?
[02:42:24.433 --> 02:42:27.275]  This movie actually exemplifies what I'm talking about right here, right?
[02:42:27.295 --> 02:42:28.756]  Children of Men, same idea.
[02:42:29.416 --> 02:42:32.598]  These films show that the giant megacities where everybody's forced to live.
[02:42:32.658 --> 02:42:34.258]  You can't live on the land anymore.
[02:42:34.298 --> 02:42:35.079]  You can't be on the country.
[02:42:35.757 --> 02:42:37.518]  Can't be a country bumpkin anymore.
[02:42:38.899 --> 02:42:41.942]  Country boys cannot survive in this global order.
[02:42:42.242 --> 02:42:43.883]  You got to be moved into the megacities.
[02:42:44.304 --> 02:42:49.788]  He says that will all be in place along with the giant global brain by 2100.
[02:42:50.048 --> 02:42:51.609]  That's what's coming.
[02:42:51.629 --> 02:42:54.071]  This is future history being written right here.
[02:42:54.151 --> 02:42:54.752]  Here's the plan.
[02:42:55.232 --> 02:42:56.353]  I'm Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:43:06.508 --> 02:43:08.230]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:08.430 --> 02:43:11.593]  I'm your guest host, Nate Dyer of jamesanalysis.com.
[02:43:12.713 --> 02:43:15.376]  You know, it makes me think of David Rockefeller.
[02:43:15.456 --> 02:43:21.181]  I want to call in to tech support because my bench bot seems to be malfunctioning.
[02:43:21.241 --> 02:43:24.544]  It won't stop grabbing my pasty white booty.
[02:43:26.105 --> 02:43:27.366]  Yes, I do it really good.
[02:43:28.530 --> 02:43:29.530]  Come on, admit it, right?
[02:43:29.670 --> 02:43:37.932]  Let's talk about David Rockefeller, because as I was ending that last segment, I was talking about the religion, the religion that has to be brought about.
[02:43:37.972 --> 02:43:44.393]  We've got to have a fake religion, a bunch of fake churches, and a cult, a cult for the new world.
[02:43:44.433 --> 02:43:51.094]  Well, in the authorized biography of the Rockefellers, there is, in fact, an entire chapter on the new fake religion.
[02:43:52.834 --> 02:43:54.694]  And back in the 30s, yes, 1932, the 30s.
[02:43:58.795 --> 02:44:07.458]  Daddy Rockefeller, Jr., he says, we've got to have a world religion.
[02:44:09.018 --> 02:44:14.480]  And this world religion will be able to bring about our global plan better than anything else.
[02:44:14.940 --> 02:44:16.140]  Because everybody needs a religion.
[02:44:16.180 --> 02:44:18.361]  Everybody needs something to believe in.
[02:44:18.681 --> 02:44:21.422]  It's one of the easiest tools from the elite perspective.
[02:44:22.654 --> 02:44:25.275]  Or how to manipulate the population.
[02:44:25.295 --> 02:44:29.157]  So $75 million back in the 30s.
[02:44:29.297 --> 02:44:37.322]  That's, you know, basically a zillion dollars today, according to accurate mathematical formulations.
[02:44:38.742 --> 02:44:39.783]  Imagine how much money.
[02:44:39.943 --> 02:44:41.184]  So what was the purpose of this?
[02:44:41.224 --> 02:44:44.425]  To create the global fake ecumenist movement.
[02:44:44.445 --> 02:44:46.046]  Right.
[02:44:46.446 --> 02:44:47.627]  And so the Rockefellers.
[02:44:48.792 --> 02:44:58.418]  Not only did that, they also set up the Riverside Church, which had these statues to people like Darwin and Moses, just a bizarre mix.
[02:44:58.478 --> 02:45:13.227]  But the whole chapter ends here, page 155, by saying that together with the money donated to countless seminaries across the country, $75 million would be given everywhere, just spread out, throwing, making it rain everywhere, right?
[02:45:13.908 --> 02:45:17.070]  To create a National Council of Churches.
[02:45:17.557 --> 02:45:23.862]  And this National Council of Churches will be an engine to promote Liberation Theology, right?
[02:45:24.683 --> 02:45:24.883]  Yes.
[02:45:25.283 --> 02:45:25.884]  Liberation Theology.
[02:45:25.984 --> 02:45:26.844]  It's a Rockefeller.
[02:45:26.864 --> 02:45:29.727]  Did you know that the Rockefellers are big fans of Liberation Theology?
[02:45:30.387 --> 02:45:34.871]  Now, why would they be fans of communist ideas?
[02:45:34.991 --> 02:45:39.374]  I just can't figure out why anybody with a lot of money would like communism.
[02:45:39.414 --> 02:45:42.677]  That doesn't make any sense because the communists are against the people with money, right?
[02:45:43.297 --> 02:45:43.998]  No, they're not.
[02:45:45.278 --> 02:45:48.239]  Always, always, always, always, all the way back to Quigley.
[02:45:48.759 --> 02:45:53.240]  Go back to Quigley, right, when he's talking about the French Revolution, those commies in the French Revolution.
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:55.520]  Guess where they got their money?
[02:45:56.300 --> 02:45:56.981]  From banking elite.
[02:45:57.441 --> 02:46:02.242]  From wealthy Protestant and Swiss and other families.
[02:46:02.602 --> 02:46:04.282]  There's a whole chapter Quigley has on that.
[02:46:04.722 --> 02:46:08.223]  The French Revolution getting all this money to destroy the country.
[02:46:09.403 --> 02:46:10.744]  You think it's any different now?
[02:46:11.024 --> 02:46:12.804]  Well, no, it's not any different, right?
[02:46:13.416 --> 02:46:17.037]  Who are the protesters in the street, right?
[02:46:17.457 --> 02:46:21.178]  They're fighting the system, and the entire system's giving them hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:46:21.399 --> 02:46:28.241]  I mean, it's ludicrous, but once you understand that the richest people on the planet love communism, I mean, they love it.
[02:46:28.561 --> 02:46:30.581]  It's their favorite thing, right?
[02:46:30.601 --> 02:46:32.082]  They lick their lips at communism.
[02:46:32.802 --> 02:46:34.563]  They want to lick Marx's beard.
[02:46:34.743 --> 02:46:37.283]  They want to eat the food out of Karl Marx's beard.
[02:46:37.323 --> 02:46:38.924]  That's how much they love communism, right?
[02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:46.602]  And they openly say it, right, in the 1978 or 1979 editorial from A China Traveler by David Rockefeller.
[02:46:46.622 --> 02:46:50.644]  There's also a lesser-known essay, by the way, in Yale.
[02:46:50.684 --> 02:46:54.245]  There was an old Yale publication about Mao.
[02:46:54.945 --> 02:46:56.146]  Mao was a yali.
[02:46:56.186 --> 02:46:56.706]  Did you know that?
[02:46:57.006 --> 02:46:57.987]  Yale and China.
[02:46:59.607 --> 02:47:06.830]  And this essay talks about, it's Yale's publication, that the Skull and Bone Society wanted to put Mao into power.
[02:47:07.449 --> 02:47:12.773]  To have this revolution in China, to completely, basically rewrite the country.
[02:47:13.814 --> 02:47:23.281]  That's why, as I'm sure you've heard Alex mention many times, Chiang Kai-shek, they discarded him, get him out of here, and let's put our full weight and support behind Mao.
[02:47:23.321 --> 02:47:29.306]  In fact, I've got Bill Donovan, right, founder of the OSS, I've got his autobiography, he brags about it.
[02:47:29.326 --> 02:47:36.091]  He says, yeah, we wanted to put Mao in, right, this is a great thing, right, to destroy this whole country, it was so great.
[02:47:36.681 --> 02:47:45.827]  Then fast forward, you've got in the middle of the Rockefeller's memoirs, he says, yeah, the whole Nixon thing, remember Nixon going to China, right?
[02:47:45.947 --> 02:47:47.628]  He says, no, no, no, that was actually me.
[02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:55.393]  He says, this, he says, I wanted to put Chase Bank in Communist China so that it would be the bank.
[02:47:56.294 --> 02:47:57.134]  And he brags about that.
[02:47:57.454 --> 02:48:02.818]  That's why he writes the China Traveler editorial, bragging and saying,
[02:48:03.738 --> 02:48:08.701]  That was all engineered so that David Rockefeller could get his thang going in China.
[02:48:08.761 --> 02:48:14.504]  Now, I mentioned the religion earlier in terms of older plans with H.G.
[02:48:14.544 --> 02:48:15.424]  Wells and these characters.
[02:48:16.505 --> 02:48:20.427]  I didn't even know about this book, and this is what I do all the time, read all these nerdy, boring books.
[02:48:20.947 --> 02:48:21.927]  And what do you know?
[02:48:21.947 --> 02:48:21.987]  H.G.
[02:48:22.508 --> 02:48:26.030]  Wells has a book about the coming religion.
[02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:28.651]  It's called God, the Invisible King.
[02:48:28.671 --> 02:48:30.892]  And you see that title and you think, well, that sounds good.
[02:48:30.912 --> 02:48:31.452]  I mean, H.G.
[02:48:31.492 --> 02:48:32.633]  Wells, he believes in God, right?
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:33.560]  H.G.
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:38.603]  Wells was a hardcore communist who said, the family, it's gone.
[02:48:38.663 --> 02:48:39.843]  We've got to end the family.
[02:48:40.183 --> 02:48:42.264]  That's the enemy number one, right?
[02:48:43.245 --> 02:48:45.046]  Traditional religion, enemy number two.
[02:48:46.606 --> 02:48:48.367]  Nation states, enemy number three, right?
[02:48:48.407 --> 02:48:50.828]  I mean, just total lunatic.
[02:48:51.769 --> 02:48:56.251]  And all of his science fiction, by the way, he transmits the same idea throughout all of his science fiction.
[02:48:57.555 --> 02:49:04.545]  But he wrote this obscure book that I came across, and he outlines what the coming religion is.
[02:49:04.606 --> 02:49:10.875]  And it might surprise you because you think, well, he's going to say it's like a atheistic thing and it's all fake.
[02:49:11.830 --> 02:49:16.053]  Actually, he says that we do have a personal deity that we believe in.
[02:49:16.453 --> 02:49:21.396]  Now, he does say it's like personified generic nature and evolutionary process, yeah.
[02:49:21.916 --> 02:49:25.318]  But on page 101, he says that we're not talking about Jesus.
[02:49:25.719 --> 02:49:26.739]  We don't want to know that Jesus.
[02:49:26.779 --> 02:49:27.320]  Get that out of here.
[02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:28.300]  That's not what we're talking about.
[02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:31.022]  He says our God is Prometheus.
[02:49:31.542 --> 02:49:31.762]  What?
[02:49:32.743 --> 02:49:32.943]  Yes.
[02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:36.265]  It's like that angel of light, Lucifer.
[02:49:36.685 --> 02:49:38.266]  He says that's our real God.
[02:49:39.167 --> 02:49:39.527]  Literally.
[02:49:40.265 --> 02:49:40.705]  Lucifer.
[02:49:41.225 --> 02:49:48.849]  Now, you can debate whether he thought that was a real entity or whether it was just some sort of symbolic thing, but he kind of goes back and forth in the book.
[02:49:48.889 --> 02:49:54.812]  He doesn't seem to say for sure whether he thinks it's, but it's basically it's an anti-Christ type of thing.
[02:49:54.832 --> 02:49:55.932]  That's what I'm trying to get at here, right?
[02:49:55.952 --> 02:49:58.674]  I mean, he's, it doesn't matter whether he thinks it's a real entity or not.
[02:49:58.714 --> 02:50:03.856]  He's basically saying, I serve this anti-Christ spirit that I'm going to call Lucifer
[02:50:04.236 --> 02:50:08.418]  We're going to have a federation of planets and all this kind of stuff.
[02:50:08.498 --> 02:50:09.859]  And you all got to die.
[02:50:09.879 --> 02:50:12.941]  But look, at least you're going to die for something good.
[02:50:24.235 --> 02:50:26.436]  At least I'm going to give you something to die for.
[02:50:26.496 --> 02:50:27.397]  Don't you appreciate that?
[02:50:28.137 --> 02:50:30.898]  So I can go be Captain Kirk, right?
[02:50:30.938 --> 02:50:33.620]  Flying around, having sex with the green space women, right?
[02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:34.260]  That's what he says.
[02:50:35.401 --> 02:50:37.122]  He doesn't say the space women, but you know what I mean.
[02:50:38.042 --> 02:50:48.207]  And so look, what I'm trying to get across is that whether we go back a hundred years or whether we go back to, or whether we fast forward to the present day, what I mentioned last time with Alex, right?
[02:50:48.227 --> 02:50:50.768]  The head of Davos, Klaus Schwab.
[02:50:50.788 --> 02:50:52.429]  Klaus Schwab.
[02:50:53.130 --> 02:50:53.930]  He writes a whole book.
[02:50:54.838 --> 02:50:59.062]  Saying exactly the same thing that the people 100 years ago said.
[02:51:00.002 --> 02:51:00.683]  Here it is, right?
[02:51:00.723 --> 02:51:02.044]  The Shape of Things to Come.
[02:51:02.625 --> 02:51:03.425]  Ever watch that movie?
[02:51:04.506 --> 02:51:08.329]  It's hard to watch because it's really grainy bad, but H.G.
[02:51:08.349 --> 02:51:10.131]  Wells, he made that.
[02:51:10.171 --> 02:51:12.673]  Well, the story was written before World War II.
[02:51:13.273 --> 02:51:14.094]  And what does it predict?
[02:51:14.154 --> 02:51:19.979]  It predicts a big world war with flying Masonic ships bombing everything.
[02:51:20.139 --> 02:51:20.439]  Literally.
[02:51:20.459 --> 02:51:21.060]  That's what he says.
[02:51:22.623 --> 02:51:35.606]  And so you fast forward to Klaus Schwab and we have the Internet of Things, we have biotech, we have geoengineering, all listed, all public.
[02:51:36.286 --> 02:51:40.727]  And I'm going to give you one last obscure book that a lot of people don't know about and they have forgotten.
[02:51:41.467 --> 02:51:44.748]  And it's part of this inner cadre, this inner cult.
[02:51:45.208 --> 02:51:48.149]  His name was Charles Galton Darwin.
[02:51:48.469 --> 02:51:49.649]  He wrote a book called The Next
[02:51:50.604 --> 02:51:51.584]  Million years.
[02:51:51.704 --> 02:51:54.485]  I don't know how he knew what was going to happen in a million years.
[02:51:54.505 --> 02:51:55.505]  That's a pretty big number.
[02:51:55.545 --> 02:51:56.545]  A million years, right?
[02:51:56.565 --> 02:52:06.427]  It's like when they talk about how Atali has this chapter about 11 million years ago, a monkey jumped out of a tree and that's how humans started walking was because it was 11.
[02:52:07.187 --> 02:52:08.947]  How do you know what happened 11 million years ago?
[02:52:09.267 --> 02:52:09.727]  Give me a break.
[02:52:09.767 --> 02:52:10.047]  Come on.
[02:52:10.987 --> 02:52:17.509]  But regardless, even though it sounds like science fiction, in their mind, they're writing future history by putting out the science fiction, right?
[02:52:17.549 --> 02:52:18.609]  So what does he say?
[02:52:18.629 --> 02:52:19.729]  Now, you might think again,
[02:52:20.586 --> 02:52:25.908]  Well, he's going to be talking about, you know, science and the importance of science.
[02:52:25.928 --> 02:52:26.708]  Yeah, he does say that.
[02:52:27.369 --> 02:52:29.729]  But who does he say the future will belong to?
[02:52:30.610 --> 02:52:34.791]  He says DNA, RNA, tracking, tracing, all of that, literally.
[02:52:34.891 --> 02:52:39.473]  He says, well, tell us who the superior bloodlines are.
[02:52:39.933 --> 02:52:40.113]  What?
[02:52:40.714 --> 02:52:41.614]  Yes, bloodlines.
[02:52:41.794 --> 02:52:48.316]  He says the elite have known about and worship the bloodlines all the way back to Ptolemy and ancient dynasties.
[02:52:48.356 --> 02:52:49.857]  He says these royal bloodlines.
[02:52:50.942 --> 02:53:00.884]  We'll be tweaked so that you'll have breeders and specified breeding so that only the elite bloodlines can go into the future.
[02:53:02.104 --> 02:53:03.564]  What do we see in the news now?
[02:53:04.144 --> 02:53:05.965]  Covipass, right?
[02:53:06.045 --> 02:53:08.065]  Bill Gates, we gotta get these numbers down.
[02:53:08.245 --> 02:53:19.527]  Here's my chart for the numbers and if we get all these numbers down, you know, then maybe I can corner the market on New Balance sneakers with my slave class market that's building all my New Balance sneakers, right?
[02:53:20.194 --> 02:53:25.656]  Bill Gates, Kobe Pass, 50 years ago, Charles Galton, Darwin.
[02:53:26.377 --> 02:53:27.937]  I'm Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:53:28.017 --> 02:53:29.678]  Thank you for letting me be here.
[02:53:29.698 --> 02:53:30.918]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:30.938 --> 02:53:32.279]  Be sure and support InfoWars.
[02:53:33.099 --> 02:53:34.060]  Support them in any way.
[02:53:34.180 --> 02:53:34.820]  Get this out.
[02:53:34.940 --> 02:53:35.680]  Share this stuff.
[02:53:36.301 --> 02:53:36.961]  Buy my books.
[02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:54.943]  2020 is a very special year to the globalists, to the occultists, to those that are into esoteric mysticism.
[02:53:55.323 --> 02:54:01.546]  And they believe this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America and the world and bring in their anti-God, anti-human tyranny.
[02:54:02.086 --> 02:54:09.729]  Well, we're here on air and we just ask you all to realize that we're in opposition to this evil and that only your word of mouth helps us reach new people.
[02:54:10.289 --> 02:54:12.050]  I want to salute you all and thank you for your support.
[02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:16.311]  I also want you to know that our 4th of July, once a year mega sale is here.
[02:54:16.812 --> 02:54:20.073]  And we've got a bunch of stuff at 50-60% off right now.
[02:54:20.373 --> 02:54:22.654]  But BODY is our ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:54:23.314 --> 02:54:25.655]  This is a turmeric extract, one of the strongest ones out there.
[02:54:25.675 --> 02:54:28.836]  It's so good for your body, so good for your joints, so good for your cells.
[02:54:29.396 --> 02:54:33.518]  It is now back in stock, sold out for over 3 months, and it is at 50% off.
[02:54:34.678 --> 02:54:36.579]  DNA Force Plus is back in stock.
[02:54:37.379 --> 02:54:38.320]  It's 50% off as well.
[02:54:38.820 --> 02:54:43.443]  Check it all out at InfoWarsTore.com and remember your funding of our operation makes it all possible.
[02:54:43.723 --> 02:54:46.805]  Plus, these are great things that God designed for you and your family's bodies.
[02:54:47.025 --> 02:54:53.730]  Please take action.
[02:54:55.431 --> 02:55:06.418]  Hollywood, the Democratic Party, the unelected EU bureaucracy, and the Fortune 100 corporations are almost unanimously rooting against America
[02:55:06.957 --> 02:55:09.659]  Against the American people and against our president, Donald Trump.
[02:55:10.179 --> 02:55:25.007]  They're all over the news saying the American century's over and that America's quarantined and that COVID-19 was our fault and that the United States may not even exist in the future and certainly isn't going to be a superpower.
[02:55:27.648 --> 02:55:32.551]  We have to be politically more engaged than we've ever been before to stop this new world war takeover.
[02:55:33.305 --> 02:55:37.951]  But we also have to understand that we have to reach out to God and pray and ask for God's intervention.
[02:55:38.372 --> 02:55:41.336]  And we also have to be physically prepared for what's happening.
[02:55:41.356 --> 02:55:44.941]  If you don't have a firearm and don't know how to use it, don't have ammo, you really should get some.
[02:55:45.542 --> 02:55:49.007]  And you really should get high quality storable foods and water filtration systems.
[02:55:49.389 --> 02:55:55.214]  And in those two departments, water filtration and storable food, we have the highest quality at the best price you're going to find anywhere.
[02:55:55.594 --> 02:55:57.716]  I would suggest now you get your storable food today.
[02:55:57.736 --> 02:55:59.757]  It only takes about four weeks to ship it out to you.
[02:56:00.058 --> 02:56:03.621]  So many others are sold out, but InfoWareStore.com has it and is ready to ship it to you.
[02:56:04.622 --> 02:56:15.730]  The New World Order social engineers are all on record that their entire program is about domesticating us, dumbing us down, and making it to where we are not self-sufficient.
[02:56:16.371 --> 02:56:26.398]  During the Great Depression in the 1920s, it's estimated by major universities that around 7 million Americans starved to death from malnutrition or died from diseases because their immune systems were run down.
[02:56:27.319 --> 02:56:31.404]  Now, back then we were 90% rural, and almost everybody was self-sufficient.
[02:56:32.105 --> 02:56:39.414]  Now we're 90% urban, and of the 10% that are rural, it's estimated that less than half of those are actually self-sufficient.
[02:56:40.523 --> 02:56:43.187]  We are sitting on top of a time bomb.
[02:56:43.727 --> 02:56:44.989]  We have been domesticated.
[02:56:45.470 --> 02:56:50.557]  I know how to skin a buck and run a trot line, but I don't know one one-hundredth of what my grandfather knew.
[02:56:50.937 --> 02:56:53.080]  I don't know one twentieth of what my dad knew.
[02:56:53.561 --> 02:56:55.423]  And quite frankly, I've dropped the ball.
[02:56:55.604 --> 02:56:56.885]  My children are city slickers.
[02:56:57.406 --> 02:57:00.028]  They know how to shoot a gun, change a tire, that's about it.
[02:57:00.648 --> 02:57:05.251]  We need to get back to the land, back to self-sufficiency, and back to being prepared.
[02:57:05.531 --> 02:57:14.056]  And the way to start, ladies and gentlemen, is having friends and family with a bug-out plan if there is a total collapse, and water filtration, and food to last you at least a few months.
[02:57:14.696 --> 02:57:16.979]  And the food we have is very high quality.
[02:57:17.219 --> 02:57:19.582]  It's in great containers that are great to be mobile.
[02:57:19.942 --> 02:57:22.285]  They have wide selection, special diets, you name it.
[02:57:22.505 --> 02:57:25.408]  It's the best price you're going to find for quality food like this.
[02:57:25.488 --> 02:57:28.672]  And most importantly, all the other big companies have become fly-by-night.
[02:57:29.132 --> 02:57:30.574]  They only keep a little bit of food on hand.
[02:57:31.214 --> 02:57:31.374]  I think?
[02:57:47.900 --> 02:57:48.361]  I told you
[02:58:06.434 --> 02:58:09.518]  And this food lasts 25 years inside the containers.
[02:58:09.878 --> 02:58:16.046]  So it's something you can hide, something you can bury, something you know is an ace in the hole for you and your family in the future.
[02:58:16.587 --> 02:58:21.473]  And the little bit of profit that comes in funds the InfoWar to continue to warn the people.
[02:58:21.793 --> 02:58:28.099]  So you're also funding InfoWars, the most powerful Paul Revere organization in the world, and it's powered by you.
[02:58:28.659 --> 02:58:30.941]  Get ready, get prepared, spread the word.
[02:58:31.002 --> 02:58:37.427]  Whatever you do, pray to God and get yourself right with God because this is the real deal and things will only get crazier from here on out.
[02:58:38.028 --> 02:58:38.869]  Good luck and God bless.
[02:59:01.775 --> 02:59:05.817]  Go to m4wars.com and get the TurboForce.
[02:59:05.857 --> 02:59:06.918]  I work long hours.
[02:59:06.998 --> 02:59:08.999]  I work 18-19 hours a day sometimes.
[02:59:09.059 --> 02:59:12.901]  Sometimes I work 24 hours because we're so short-handed with the coronavirus.
[02:59:12.961 --> 02:59:14.282]  People don't want to come to work.
[02:59:14.462 --> 02:59:17.003]  But some people are just taking an option and I'm cool with that.
[02:59:17.063 --> 02:59:18.824]  But anyways, I take the TurboForce.
[02:59:18.884 --> 02:59:21.165]  He's got a product called TurboForce All Natural.
[02:59:21.205 --> 02:59:23.666]  Man, the energy is amazing.
[02:59:23.766 --> 02:59:26.788]  I get about 10 hours worth of just sustained energy.
[02:59:26.868 --> 02:59:28.029]  Sustained energy.
[02:59:28.909 --> 02:59:32.772]  I'm recommending these websites and I'm recommending these products not because I get paid.
[02:59:32.792 --> 02:59:34.713]  I don't get a referral fee or anything like that.
[02:59:35.173 --> 02:59:36.634]  This is just my personal experience.
[02:59:36.654 --> 02:59:40.937]  I know their brands, but their brands and their websites, they're very famous.
[02:59:40.957 --> 02:59:42.097]  A lot of people know who they are.
[02:59:42.217 --> 02:59:45.299]  I take products from people that I've been listening to for years.
[02:59:45.319 --> 02:59:47.741]  And I've been listening to InfoWars.com for years.
[02:59:47.801 --> 02:59:51.203]  I've been listening to Dr. Root for years and years and years.
[02:59:51.303 --> 02:59:55.906]  I've taken a lot of supplements from other companies, other places, and a lot of that crap is snake oil.
[02:59:56.026 --> 02:59:57.147]  Believe me, snake oil.
[02:59:57.227 --> 03:00:00.949]  But the TurboForce, I take that, and I'm good for the entire day.
[03:00:00.969 --> 03:00:02.710]  I'm good for like 12, 13 hours.
[03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:03.351]  At least.
[03:00:03.471 --> 03:00:04.992]  But anyways, I can't speak enough to it.
[03:00:05.012 --> 03:00:06.052]  Working long hours.
[03:00:06.353 --> 03:00:06.973]  I need it.
[03:00:07.133 --> 03:00:07.794]  I need it.
[03:00:07.874 --> 03:00:08.654]  TurboForce.
[03:00:09.395 --> 03:00:10.095]  Infowars.com.
