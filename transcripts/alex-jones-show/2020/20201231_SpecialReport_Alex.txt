[00:08:19.623 --> 00:08:20.928]  Those don't sound like fireworks.
[00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:21.872]  They sound like fireworks.
[00:08:21.952 --> 00:08:22.876]  Oh, you think so?
[00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:23.940]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:15:28.465 --> 00:15:31.386]  Wow, that was fun.
[00:15:31.426 --> 00:15:35.887]  Did you guys see that?
[00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:51.754]  Hey, did you guys see that?
[00:15:51.814 --> 00:15:58.441]  This guy tried to fly something at me, and he threw it with his vagina, and so it didn't even come near me.
[00:15:59.403 --> 00:16:00.824]  He tried his best, though.
[00:16:01.785 --> 00:16:03.067]  He tried his best, though.
[00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:05.790]  How's everybody doing out here?
[00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:20.609]  Are we ready to put 45 behind us or what?
[00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:26.615]  So, you guys know that Steve Adler actually lives here?
[00:16:26.635 --> 00:16:29.258]  Steve Adler exists right up there, somewhere up there.
[00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:35.565]  Somewhere up there, Steve Adler is crapping his diaper right now.
[00:16:35.585 --> 00:16:36.967]  A wise man once said,
[00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:45.319]  A wise man once said that when the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:48.881]  But when the government fears the people, there is freedom.
[00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:55.344]  So I think we got a little taste of freedom tonight, because Steve Alder is up in his tent out in the city!
[00:16:55.364 --> 00:16:58.866]  You see Alex on board there?
[00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:01.948]  I don't see him.
[00:17:02.108 --> 00:17:07.131]  I don't think so.
[00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:25.509]  I've already thought of it.
[00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.809]  We need to get...
[00:17:41.067 --> 00:17:42.148]  She's at work.
[00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:43.729]  I'm like, doing what?
[00:17:43.769 --> 00:17:49.412]  Bill Gates does not want you to be here.
[00:17:49.452 --> 00:17:50.733]  That's offensive.
[00:17:50.773 --> 00:17:51.994]  Bye, Bill Gates!
[00:17:52.134 --> 00:17:53.215]  Is this their car?
[00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:55.776]  Is this their car?
[00:17:55.916 --> 00:17:58.678]  It's got a rollback.
[00:17:58.918 --> 00:18:00.139]  It is, right?
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.360]  We're good to go.
[00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:31.727]  We're good.
[00:18:54.679 --> 00:19:05.243]  Why doesn't Steve Edmund come down here and tell us that we're not free?
[00:19:05.923 --> 00:19:23.169]  Why doesn't the communist, Steve Edmund, come down here and tell all these businesses that lost tens of thousands of dollars tonight that they're not allowed to make money?
[00:19:24.446 --> 00:19:36.212]  Why doesn't Steve Adler come down here and tell the people of Austin, Texas that he is a tyrant, and when he says you're not allowed to open your business, you must shut down?
[00:19:36.672 --> 00:19:38.053]  And look at this guy right here.
[00:19:38.633 --> 00:19:40.614]  This guy loves Steve Adler, doesn't he?
[00:19:41.995 --> 00:19:42.775]  He's in the back.
[00:19:43.196 --> 00:19:46.277]  This guy's in the back and he's masturbating to Steve Adler.
[00:19:46.797 --> 00:19:47.638]  People love it.
[00:19:49.514 --> 00:19:50.655]  Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
[00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:52.937]  Are you in front of me?
[00:19:52.977 --> 00:19:54.278]  Do you like Steve Adler?
[00:19:54.899 --> 00:19:56.640]  Yes, we know you like who is what.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.821]  Thank you very much.
[00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:58.622]  We get that.
[00:19:59.622 --> 00:20:02.185]  This guy's out here in a full-blown gas mask!
[00:20:02.605 --> 00:20:03.706]  Look at this guy!
[00:20:04.647 --> 00:20:06.108]  Are you afraid of COVID, dude?
[00:20:07.729 --> 00:20:11.372]  Hey, this guy's so afraid of COVID, he's out here in a gas mask, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:11.973 --> 00:20:14.234]  In fact, that might even be Steve Adler!
[00:20:15.075 --> 00:20:16.376]  He's not Steve Adler!
[00:20:17.597 --> 00:20:18.238]  We don't know!
[00:20:19.628 --> 00:20:20.269]  I don't think so.
[00:20:20.309 --> 00:20:23.751]  I think Steve Adler is upstairs hiding right now.
[00:20:25.493 --> 00:20:28.655]  And I think Steve Adler may even be a little bit afraid right now.
[00:20:30.316 --> 00:20:37.601]  Because we got people down here that are sick and tired of Steve Adler thinking he can shut our city down.
[00:20:38.922 --> 00:20:40.964]  I don't think so, Steve.
[00:20:42.285 --> 00:20:45.347]  And you know what?
[00:20:45.387 --> 00:20:48.830]  We went down the street tonight and I had Democrats
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.504]  That said that they hate me, but they also hate Steve Adler!
[00:20:54.725 --> 00:20:56.986]  So, nobody likes Steve Adler!
[00:20:57.507 --> 00:20:59.008]  Nobody likes this guy!
[00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:10.178]  And I would like to know how Steve Adler can afford a penthouse at the W every night on his mayoral salary!
[00:21:11.784 --> 00:21:26.834]  I'd like to know how Steve Adler can afford to pay for his daughter's lavish wedding in Mexico and fly out there and apply the check on a mayor's salary!
[00:21:26.874 --> 00:21:29.876]  Does Steve Adler think money grows on trees?
[00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:37.020]  He must, because he's killing all the bars and restaurants in Austin, Texas!
[00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:39.902]  And here we are on New Year's Eve,
[00:21:40.709 --> 00:21:57.316]  Normally the streets would be bustling with activity, bars would be filled, drinks would be flowing, meals would be eaten, and it's all been shut down because of one dirty communist who is right up there in the W Hotel.
[00:21:58.477 --> 00:22:02.938]  He's right up there, hiding, like the coward he is.
[00:22:03.939 --> 00:22:05.539]  We know you're up there, Steve.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.801]  Unless, of course, Steve flew to Mexico again.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.563]  Maybe Steve hopped on a private jet and flew to Mexico without a mask.
[00:22:14.644 --> 00:22:17.726]  Steve Adler says we have to wear a mask.
[00:22:18.647 --> 00:22:23.670]  And Steve Adler says that we're not allowed to open our businesses on New Year's Eve.
[00:22:26.232 --> 00:22:30.916]  And then cowards like this come out here wearing their masks to hide their face.
[00:22:32.437 --> 00:22:39.202]  And they don't even realize that Steve Adler is killing this city.
[00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.459]  Do we have another fan up here, too?
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.981]  I love how the Democrats are cheering on the government running their lives.
[00:22:50.101 --> 00:22:50.842]  Isn't this funny?
[00:22:51.722 --> 00:22:52.562]  Isn't this funny?
[00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:58.623]  You asked a liberal... Hold on, go ahead.
[00:22:58.844 --> 00:22:59.124]  Go ahead.
[00:22:59.304 --> 00:22:59.604]  Hold on.
[00:22:59.684 --> 00:23:01.844]  Who's this random guy on the porch right now?
[00:23:02.644 --> 00:23:03.445]  Where is he at?
[00:23:05.025 --> 00:23:05.665]  Is that him?
[00:23:07.046 --> 00:23:08.346]  Is that... Are you talking to me?
[00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:10.515]  Is that you?
[00:23:12.316 --> 00:23:13.316]  No, that's not you?
[00:23:13.336 --> 00:23:16.557]  He's a coward.
[00:23:17.378 --> 00:23:18.958]  He's another liberal coward.
[00:23:18.978 --> 00:23:20.899]  Hi!
[00:23:20.919 --> 00:23:22.859]  I'm a Democrat!
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.841]  And I like it when the government runs my life and tells me what to do!
[00:23:27.861 --> 00:23:27.901]  Hi!
[00:23:29.222 --> 00:23:31.622]  I'm a liberal!
[00:23:32.363 --> 00:23:34.343]  And I live my life in fear!
[00:23:34.363 --> 00:23:39.065]  In fact, a virus actually runs my life now!
[00:23:39.986 --> 00:23:42.006]  The virus is now my god!
[00:23:42.026 --> 00:23:44.727]  You don't like Biden?
[00:23:45.647 --> 00:23:50.668]  Well, hey now, Biden sells out for the Chinese better than anyone else.
[00:23:51.988 --> 00:23:53.388]  You gotta give Biden credit.
[00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:59.930]  And don't forget, I challenge anybody here, you know, you guys think you're all real cool, don't you?
[00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.670]  I bet none of you could do as much crack in one night as Hunter Biden.
[00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:07.411]  So you're really probably not that cool.
[00:24:08.576 --> 00:24:15.238]  In fact, I heard Hunter Biden, y'all, I shouldn't say, it's a family show, but let's just say Chinese hookers.
[00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:17.559]  So this is pretty amazing.
[00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:20.640]  I don't know how many people we have out here, but I know this.
[00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:22.821]  I said this once already.
[00:24:22.861 --> 00:24:23.641]  I'll say it again.
[00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:31.504]  I believe it was Thomas Jefferson once said that when the people fear the government, there's tyranny.
[00:24:31.984 --> 00:24:34.485]  And when the government fears the people, there's freedom.
[00:24:35.046 --> 00:24:35.966]  Now I'll be honest.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:45.766]  I don't have any feelings of goodwill towards Steve Adler, but I also don't wish any harm upon Steve Adler.
[00:24:46.486 --> 00:24:48.267]  I wish to defeat him politically.
[00:24:49.188 --> 00:25:00.676]  But I can tell you right now that Steve Adler is about 20 stories up pissing his pants right now because the people in Austin are fed up with his tyranny.
[00:25:02.017 --> 00:25:03.158]  And earlier today,
[00:25:04.582 --> 00:25:17.431]  Earlier today, local bar owners and restaurant owners had a press conference where they told Steve Adler that he can go to hell and they're going to be open on New Year's Eve.
[00:25:18.852 --> 00:25:30.360]  And how bad, how evil of a man is Steve Adler when 48 hours, 48 hours before New Year's Eve, when restaurants have already prepped
[00:25:31.607 --> 00:25:34.509]  They've already taken their reservations.
[00:25:34.589 --> 00:25:39.412]  They've already purchased the food and beverage to be able to get through New Year's Eve.
[00:25:40.633 --> 00:25:49.959]  And then the Grinch that tried to steal New Year's Eve, Steve Adler, comes in 48 hours before New Year's Eve and says, you have to close at 1030.
[00:25:50.999 --> 00:25:56.583]  That's basically asking these bars and these restaurants to commit suicide.
[00:25:57.845 --> 00:26:03.588]  And then low-life scum like this guy over here in the gas mask comes out and celebrates it.
[00:26:04.328 --> 00:26:05.328]  But you know what, sir?
[00:26:05.408 --> 00:26:10.811]  You'll never own a small business, and so of course you don't care if small businesses get shut down.
[00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:12.612]  You love big government.
[00:26:13.352 --> 00:26:14.713]  Steve Adler is your daddy.
[00:26:14.733 --> 00:26:20.975]  In fact, aren't you due in Steve Adler's room in, what, like 20 minutes for the New Year's blow?
[00:26:23.718 --> 00:26:29.780]  I think he's, that's why he's got the mask on, because he wants to keep things clean for the Adler suck later.
[00:26:31.561 --> 00:26:34.022]  Hey, how much does Adler pay for a reach around, bud?
[00:26:35.242 --> 00:26:36.783]  Enough for you to come out here, huh?
[00:26:38.303 --> 00:26:39.704]  Well, look, I think it's sad.
[00:26:41.164 --> 00:26:43.265]  Liberals used to be all about free speech.
[00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:46.606]  Liberals used to be all about small government.
[00:26:47.643 --> 00:26:53.446]  And now they cheer it on when politicians shut down local businesses.
[00:26:54.226 --> 00:27:02.751]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Microsoft, Amazon are making billions and billions of dollars.
[00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:04.171]  Do you think that's a good thing, liberal?
[00:27:05.172 --> 00:27:06.693]  No, he can't respond to a question.
[00:27:07.133 --> 00:27:08.634]  I noticed you stopped filming, too.
[00:27:08.674 --> 00:27:09.074]  What happened?
[00:27:09.094 --> 00:27:10.394]  Did your phone run out of battery?
[00:27:12.035 --> 00:27:14.557]  Your Chinese slave made phone run out of battery there?
[00:27:14.577 --> 00:27:17.058]  I love all these liberals.
[00:27:17.805 --> 00:27:20.246]  They want to act like they're such social justice warriors.
[00:27:20.286 --> 00:27:28.047]  They run around in their Nike shoes, and they run around with their iPhones made by slaves, and they want to tell us how we're bad people.
[00:27:29.207 --> 00:27:31.308]  Yeah, no, not so fast, bud.
[00:27:31.908 --> 00:27:32.728]  Not so fast.
[00:27:33.988 --> 00:27:38.729]  So I want to salute everybody that came out here tonight, because here's the deal.
[00:27:40.169 --> 00:27:42.190]  Again, we are not violent people.
[00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.950]  This is what a peaceful protest looks like.
[00:27:45.591 --> 00:27:45.871]  But!
[00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:47.311]  But!
[00:27:48.052 --> 00:28:01.996]  If Steve Adler is feeling a little tense tonight, and if Steve Adler is fearing that the people are actually paying attention to what he's doing tonight, then we have been successful.
[00:28:03.216 --> 00:28:08.837]  All we ask, Mary Adler, is that you resign, or that you reopen Austin.
[00:28:09.297 --> 00:28:10.258]  That's all we ask.
[00:28:10.478 --> 00:28:11.418]  It's very simple.
[00:28:12.245 --> 00:28:18.510]  Either Steve Adler resigns tomorrow, or he allows bars and restaurants to reopen tomorrow.
[00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.132]  And I don't see anybody here wearing a mask, either.
[00:28:22.172 --> 00:28:22.893]  What's up with that?
[00:28:22.933 --> 00:28:24.314]  You guys don't live in fear, huh?
[00:28:25.494 --> 00:28:27.296]  Well, yeah, one liberal's wearing a mask.
[00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:28.977]  Is that what you're going to do to Adler later, Buck?
[00:28:29.898 --> 00:28:31.359]  You're getting your practice in, aren't you?
[00:28:32.459 --> 00:28:33.140]  Hey, you know what?
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.543]  Look, I can honestly, dude, I could roast you all night, and it'd be very entertaining.
[00:28:38.143 --> 00:28:41.646]  But at the end of the day, you know that we all have to share this world, right?
[00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:48.031]  So you might as well take the mask off, embrace humanity, embrace your freedom.
[00:28:48.431 --> 00:28:49.912]  You don't have to be a slave.
[00:28:50.452 --> 00:28:52.313]  You don't have to be a liberal dumbass.
[00:28:52.813 --> 00:28:55.894]  You can be an American freedom-loving patriot just like the rest of us.
[00:28:55.914 --> 00:28:56.614]  You know that, right?
[00:28:57.895 --> 00:29:00.996]  Or would you rather go give Adler a reach-around later?
[00:29:02.576 --> 00:29:03.697]  All right.
[00:29:04.297 --> 00:29:05.698]  So we have his answer.
[00:29:06.318 --> 00:29:07.518]  It's really too bad, though.
[00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:09.179]  It's really too bad.
[00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:13.671]  See, I look over here at Bob's Steak and Chophouse.
[00:29:14.432 --> 00:29:15.293]  Hi Bob's!
[00:29:16.273 --> 00:29:17.795]  Hi Bob's, we love you guys!
[00:29:19.216 --> 00:29:24.440]  Bob's Steak and Chophouse should be filled with people to the brim!
[00:29:25.601 --> 00:29:29.264]  But it's not because of Steve Adler!
[00:29:29.404 --> 00:29:31.926]  So I just hope

[00:32:44.407 --> 00:32:45.628]  We're good to go.
[00:33:11.146 --> 00:33:23.195]  You don't have a blob on you.
[00:33:31.153 --> 00:33:32.954]  Are you here for the cobbo?
