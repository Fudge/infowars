[00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:11.051]  Today, in the early morning hours of Christmas, a large truck bomb housed inside an RV exploded outside the AT&T Main Communications building in Nashville.
[00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:23.514]  The individual, organization, or group behind the attack went out of their way to warn the public to get away before the bomb detonated by broadcasting for more than 10 minutes that there was a bomb on board the vehicle that was about to detonate.
[00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:27.255]  This area must be evacuated now.
[00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:32.111]  All buildings in this area are being evacuated now.
[00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:38.962]  All buildings in this area are being evacuated now.
[00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:43.029]  If you can hear this message, evacuate now.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.105]  9-1-1 also received a call claiming that gunshots have been fired in the area minutes before the explosion.
[00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:16.348]  The FBI is now reporting that human remains have been found in the debris at the blast site.
[00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.831]  Who would have a motive to carry out an attack like this?
[00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:22.013]  Could it be a former employee?
[00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:23.174]  In the summer of 2018,
[00:01:46.813 --> 00:01:55.861]  CNN deployed a new talking point that was then adopted by almost every other cable news or broadcast news organization in the United States.
[00:01:56.502 --> 00:02:06.611]  That Donald Trump, by criticizing the press's attacks on him, was going to trigger terrorist attacks on their facilities and the murder of journalists.
[00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:11.513]  They hammered it hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times with no proof.
[00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:16.815]  To be crystal clear, InfoWars is not saying that CNN is behind the attacks.
[00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:27.479]  What we are saying is a known fact that they are the main mouthpiece of the criminal elements of the deep state and shadow government that are battling to recapture control of the United States.
[00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.503]  It is entirely possible that a lone wolf or small group carried this operation out for other reasons.
[00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:44.109]  But when you look at the history and the motive in the background, and who stands to gain from this, and all the media preconditioning and programming, this thing reeks as a possible deep state false flag operation.
[00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.934]  In August and October of 2018, I went to the airwaves to desperately warn the people
[00:02:51.474 --> 00:03:08.223]  That MSM was clearly preconditioning the population to accept that when terror attacks that they said were imminent hit mainstream media, that it was indeed the fault of whatever patsy they produced who would then take credit for Donald Trump, the nationalist and populist movement.
[00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:18.449]  I had seen this exact same rhetoric before, right before the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that was then blamed on the Patriot movement and Rush Limbaugh.
[00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:31.857]  Within days of the Supreme Court of Michigan declaring that Governor Whitmer was nothing more than a dictator and that her COVID lockdowns were illegal, suddenly the FBI busted a terror cell of militia that had been playing the kidnapper.
[00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:39.802]  It came out a week later that the terror cell was led by two FBI informants and the whole thing had been a giant setup.
[00:03:40.382 --> 00:03:49.010]  That is a smaller microcosm of what the Deep State does when they actually carry out larger terror attacks like we just witnessed in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.976]  This country is in an existential battle fighting for its very existence against a Qaikom-led globalist takeover.
[00:03:56.516 --> 00:04:04.139]  And with 25 days until the attempted installment and coronation of their agent, Joe Biden, the mainstream media is on the ropes.
[00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:05.219]  People hate them.
[00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.259]  They don't believe them.
[00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:07.300]  They don't trust them.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:18.483]  And as massive evidence comes out of collective election fraud carried by the deep state and their cohorts, the Democratic Party, the system needs something to turn themselves into victims.
[00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:23.125]  This is designed to silence the American people and their opposition.
[00:04:23.445 --> 00:04:29.547]  to the great reset and the huge COVID lockdown that is meant to be permanent if Joe Biden gets into power.
[00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:37.350]  I have been on record dozens of times in the last month saying we are now in the season of the false flag.
[00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:43.933]  We are now in the season of the establishment loading up truck bombs to bomb themselves to be victims and I have our archivist
[00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:45.414]  Looking for it right now.
[00:04:45.954 --> 00:04:55.420]  But thanks to Media Matters, George Soros' organization, we have two examples from two years ago where I warned and foreshadowed what we now happen to see unfolding.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.604]  And ladies and gentlemen, this is about taking down America and Trump and the recovery and the entire free press.
[00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:13.491]  So I'm telling you, like night follows day, the staged terror attacks are coming on big tech, government buildings, mainstream media,
[00:05:15.074 --> 00:05:17.075]  All the stars will be gone that day.
[00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:18.716]  All the stelters will be gone that day.
[00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:20.897]  All the Lester Holtz will be gone.
[00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:30.281]  And they are going to drive a truck bomb or something into a daycare at CNN or ABC or something and have people shooting everybody, you name it.
[00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:32.642]  You can see the pre-programming and say, see!
[00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:34.042]  The hate did this!
[00:05:34.082 --> 00:05:34.723]  The hate did this!
[00:05:34.743 --> 00:05:40.865]  While they cover up Antifa and the attack on Scalise and the attack on Rand Paul and all the calls to kidnap, baron, and rape him.
[00:05:41.145 --> 00:05:42.766]  And we've got to get this out to Trump.
[00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:44.747]  We've got to let him know because Trump's not calling for
[00:05:44.887 --> 00:05:45.348]  I don't know.
[00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:13.073]  These are only probing attacks to shut it up and to test the public.
[00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:17.959]  Will they buy that Soros and Hillary and Bill and Obama and Xi are poor victims?
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.042]  This is introducing them as the targets.
[00:06:20.062 --> 00:06:25.308]  They can whine and moan and predict, if Trump doesn't stop, you're gonna get us all killed!
[00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:26.290]  And then...
[00:06:27.626 --> 00:06:31.110]  Enrolls that big-ass truck bomb into CNN Center Atlanta.
[00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.131]  Boom!
[00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:35.534]  All the execs will be off on a special meeting that day.
[00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:38.357]  Most of the CNN crew would have never expected they'll get hit.
[00:06:38.757 --> 00:06:41.020]  They'll even take out a large group of their top people.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.842]  Yeah, they're getting ready to hit themselves and hit themselves hard.
[00:06:44.323 --> 00:06:46.785]  MSNBC, ABC, they're gonna hit themselves.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.561]  There's a signature.
[00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:50.464]  There's a pattern to false flags.
[00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:56.471]  And at the preliminary stages, this fits perfectly into that historical paradigm.
[00:06:56.952 --> 00:07:03.580]  But regardless, authoritarian elements of the system will try to use this event to take more Americans' liberties.
[00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:12.267]  The Democratic Party and their deep state controllers have given us years of looting and destruction as a message to the courts and the system.
[00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:22.334]  If you don't give us what we want, if you don't let us steal the election and stall Joe Biden and let China complete its takeover, we will burn every city to the ground.
[00:07:22.794 --> 00:07:32.042]  But in closing, never forget the long history of governments and other organizations staging false flag terror attacks to blander political opposition.
[00:07:32.442 --> 00:07:37.467]  And remember, it's the American birthright to be able to research and question any public event.
[00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:45.295]  Never forget that Joe Biden and his would-be incoming crew of criminals are part of the Obama crime organization.
[00:07:45.676 --> 00:07:51.202]  Never forget it was Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder who helped cover up what really happened in Oklahoma City in 1995.
[00:07:51.362 --> 00:07:58.110]  The same Holder that carried out the giant confirmed false flag operation of Fast and Furious.
[00:08:06.204 --> 00:08:07.986]  This is an important announcement.
[00:08:08.747 --> 00:08:21.803]  The lame duck president of the United States is in the throes of profound paranoid delusions, perhaps even hallucinations, and he must be removed from office as soon as possible via the 25th Amendment or by any other legal means.
[00:08:22.104 --> 00:08:25.528]  Waiting 75 days is no longer possible.
[00:08:29.087 --> 00:08:29.447]  70 days.
[00:08:29.707 --> 00:08:33.832]  You know, he'll be gone in 70 days anyway, once the Electoral College meets and we have the inauguration.
[00:08:33.852 --> 00:08:36.776]  70 days, you can do a lot of damage in 70 days.
[00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:38.778]  He still is the President of the United States.
[00:08:38.998 --> 00:08:41.441]  In two months, he's either getting inaugurated or incarcerated.
[00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:42.402]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:08:42.442 --> 00:08:45.366]  Donald Trump is going to serve another term.
[00:08:45.406 --> 00:08:48.990]  We just don't know whether it will be in Washington or in prison yet.
[00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.851]  It is clear that Donald Trump is trying to exercise the power because he can.
[00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:54.771]  And he is going to settle scores.
[00:08:55.312 --> 00:08:59.392]  But I'm very concerned what he might do in his remaining 70 days in office.
[00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:07.775]  What damage do you think that Trump will do between losing the election and the swearing, the inauguration of Joe Biden?
[00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:09.435]  Is he going to pull out?
[00:09:10.268 --> 00:09:11.148]  His military?
[00:09:11.609 --> 00:09:13.009]  Is he going to engage us?
[00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:16.731]  He has already alluded to there may be a civil war.
[00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:19.592]  What can be done to stop anything he wants to do in the next 70 days?
[00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:25.574]  Well, if Vice President Pence and the cabinet had an ounce of fortitude and spine and patriotism,
[00:09:26.114 --> 00:09:34.317]  I think they would seriously consider invoking the 25th Amendment and, you know, pushing Donald Trump out because he is just very unpredictable now.
[00:09:34.397 --> 00:09:38.419]  He's like a cornered cat, tiger, and he is going to lash out.
[00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:49.083]  Then we have to be prepared for what he is going to do in the immediate aftermath of such a loss and what he'll do for the time period between the election and the inauguration of the next president.
[00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:55.126]  The United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House, which is just
[00:09:55.985 --> 00:09:57.446]  Nice sentence to hear.
[00:09:57.746 --> 00:10:03.108]  The president came out into the White House briefing room and lied for 15 minutes.
[00:10:03.128 --> 00:10:15.974]  Just nonsensical stuff about illegal vote dumps and corrupt election officials and secret democratic counting cabals and I don't know, long form birth certificates probably.
[00:10:16.194 --> 00:10:17.034]  It's all the same.
[00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:19.115]  At the end of that speech, he should have been arrested.
[00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:23.657]  If they could have found handcuffs small enough to take him away, they would have.
[00:10:23.937 --> 00:10:29.301]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.
[00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:32.064]  So do you think the president is a national security threat?
[00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:32.664]  I do.
[00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:37.768]  And the fact that, again, that he has the powers of the presidency in his hands is quite worrisome.
[00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:39.790]  This president's going to try to steal this election.
[00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:40.690]  Tomorrow?
[00:10:41.471 --> 00:10:42.332]  Come here tomorrow.
[00:10:42.732 --> 00:10:44.914]  We're going to be talking about the 25th Amendment.
[00:10:48.076 --> 00:10:48.957]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:51.019]  Got fired.
