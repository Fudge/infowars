[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:16.219]  It's normal to get angry when a group of multinational banks that have created the debt bubble are artificially putting us in to a collapse mode to have a global reset, which they will then blame on COVID-19 that they themselves released.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.803]  COVID-19 isn't causing the global depression and the global reset out of which the new global cashless society is openly emerging.
[00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:25.065]  Exploding on the scene.
[00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:33.962]  COVID-19 hysteria is the well thought out Rockefeller Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation plans that are public.
[00:00:34.803 --> 00:00:40.144]  That's what's so incredible for the emergence of what they've already beta tested in Communist China.
[00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:56.608]  I am physically sick of looking at Fauci and Birx and Hillary and Biden and the New World Order and all their criminal activity and how they admit they're closing a tourniquet around our neck and how we'll never come out of lockdown and how they're going to put implantable chips in us.
[00:00:57.148 --> 00:00:57.388]  It just
[00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:04.459]  I'm seriously pissed, and now they've shut down parks all over Austin, and say they've got to get registered and be COVID-tracked to do it.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.501]  They're coming to our houses next!
[00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:08.522]  That's it, man.
[00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:09.843]  I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[00:01:10.484 --> 00:01:10.904]  That's it.
[00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:12.966]  It's time for serious civil disobedience.
[00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.869]  We should just open the phones up about what we should do with plans, and I'm doing it today.
[00:01:17.993 --> 00:01:18.494]  I'm done.
[00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:19.896]  I'm done, man.
[00:01:20.437 --> 00:01:20.878]  I'm done.
[00:01:21.258 --> 00:01:23.221]  You people want a damn war, you're gonna get one.
[00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:30.171]  I'm not gonna sit here while you chain us up and then have your way with us, you globalist enemies, you pieces of criminal filth!
[00:01:31.288 --> 00:01:32.969]  You see, used to I let my soul blow up on air.
[00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.850]  And instead I'm gonna do it off air.
[00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.871]  No, I'm gonna do it on air.
[00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:38.433]  And then I'm gonna do it physically out in the streets!
[00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:39.874]  You murderer!
[00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:41.014]  You Bill Gates!
[00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:42.776]  Oh, you murderer!
[00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:44.877]  Bill Gates, you're gonna burn!
[00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:50.481]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:55.164]  We're 90 days out.
[00:01:55.984 --> 00:01:57.425]  It's Tuesday, August 4th.
[00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.868]  And we've got a transmission that will be legendary.
[00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:05.505]  But first, let's look at the model the globalists are trying to impose upon us.
[00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.688]  What the future holds if we surrender.
[00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:17.706]  Both of the council members who represent this city right here indicated they would like to move forward with the process of dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department.
[00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:18.746]  We're on the right track.
[00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:25.388]  I believe that that's the right thing for us to do to make sure that we put it to the people of Minneapolis to make this change.
[00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:36.410]  We can change the name of the public safety, you know, the makeup, but until we really address racism,
[00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:39.081]  Nothing is gonna change.
[00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:41.266]  Think about the evil.
[00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:54.085]  Of all over the country, Democrats who have armed guards, you know, in Minneapolis now, they have a huge multi-million dollar budget for private security as they cut back the police force for the city council.
[00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:56.167]  Their own private royal guard!
[00:02:56.588 --> 00:03:05.996]  They've got 24-hour guards at their dirty, filthy communist houses while they defund the police for everybody else and the crime rate jumps over 150% in Minneapolis alone.
[00:03:08.158 --> 00:03:15.126]  Even before the two shootings this afternoon, the police chief called the recent increase in violent crime in Minneapolis a public health crisis.
[00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:18.630]  Officers say 12 people were shot in Uptown over the weekend.
[00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.254]  One victim, a young father, has died.
[00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:26.259]  The FBI said today it is backing up MPD with intelligence and investigative support.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.885]  Think about these people and Ilhan Omar, this monster, saved from Somalia, where her slave trade family, by the way, was being destroyed by another tribe.
[00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:38.266]  She came here two years before.
[00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:53.008]  Mogadishu and Black Hawk Down, and she attacks the men of the army in speeches that say they were killers and horrible and bad, literally trying to get food delivered to people under attack and being killed by the other main tribe.
[00:03:53.728 --> 00:03:55.390]  The scum of the earth.
[00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.992]  You save this monster.
[00:03:57.473 --> 00:03:59.134]  You take this viper, this
[00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.761]  Scorpion to your breast and it stings you!
[00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:31.989]  Imagine being a monster!
[00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:40.875]  A communist, globalist monster who's never had a real job in her life, who's siphoned off millions of dollars to all these different husbands she's got.
[00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:43.737]  We cannot stop a criminal justice system.
[00:04:44.578 --> 00:04:51.023]  We must begin the work of dismantling the whole system of oppression wherever we find it.
[00:04:51.584 --> 00:05:01.591]  And who says this country sucked when it scooped her up out of the most hellish country in Africa, probably the world, where they have sex slavery for women and their main
[00:05:02.372 --> 00:05:09.759]  The system is still slavery and piracy, and we save her, and we elect her, and she attacks us!
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:20.050]  Never stop saying, not only do we need to disinvest foreign police, but we need to completely dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.802]  The Minneapolis Police Department is rotten.
[00:05:33.162 --> 00:05:34.003]  To the root.
[00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:42.349]  And so when we dismantle it, we get rid of that cancer and we allow for something beautiful to rise.
[00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:43.209]  Oh, like Somalia?
[00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:49.694]  And that reimagining allows us to figure out what public safety looks like for us.
[00:05:49.874 --> 00:05:51.375]  That means her in charge of the police.
[00:05:52.964 --> 00:05:53.905]  You talk about frightening.
[00:05:54.425 --> 00:05:56.147]  You talk about delusional crazy people.
[00:05:56.587 --> 00:05:58.048]  All funded by Gates, the UN.
[00:05:58.568 --> 00:05:59.709]  Replacement migration.
[00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.732]  This is just a nightmare scenario, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:12.880]  And see, it's Stockholm Syndrome to love it and think it's your friend and to go along with it, when all it's doing is creating a post-human world.
[00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.218]  And that's why we're taught to hate ourselves.
[00:06:16.498 --> 00:06:18.040]  It's why we're taught that America sucks.
[00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:19.823]  It's why you're taught that humans are bad.
[00:06:20.443 --> 00:06:27.392]  So an evil group of people will have you just basically commit cultural suicide and stand down so they rule you.
[00:06:27.693 --> 00:06:28.494]  So they can get rid of you.
[00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:33.568]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:33.608 --> 00:06:35.612]  There's been a giant explosion in Beirut.
[00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.376]  The latest on that and so much more.
[00:06:39.017 --> 00:06:41.221]  Stage 4 lockdown being announced.
[00:06:41.281 --> 00:06:42.764]  This is the battle for humanity.
[00:06:42.804 --> 00:06:44.527]  This is the AI takeover.
[00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:47.373]  It is Tuesday, August 4th.
[00:06:47.393 --> 00:06:47.713]  The year is 2020.
[00:06:48.013 --> 00:06:50.556]  We are 9-0.
[00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:54.860]  90 Earth rotations out from this incredible election.
[00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:56.962]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:06:57.483 --> 00:07:04.830]  There's been a giant explosion in Beirut in a huge mushroom cloud that some thought might have been an atomic or hydrogen bomb.
[00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.072]  Going off, it could be seen from 30-40 miles
[00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:09.394]  I think?
[00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:46.736]  20 minutes ago it was terrifying mystery blast shockwave filmed over Beirut now they know it's fireworks the BBC is reporting.
[00:07:49.098 --> 00:08:02.428]  Now let's get into it here let's lay out the news you know I think the best thing for me to do is something I did yesterday and I did a pretty good job and that was in the first segment
[00:08:03.612 --> 00:08:10.118]  Doing nothing but reading headlines, and then coming back after that and getting into the headlines in specifics and detail.
[00:08:10.638 --> 00:08:13.140]  Because that just gives you the flavor of what's going on.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.642]  So let's go ahead and do that right now.
[00:08:16.103 --> 00:08:20.266]  New York Times op-ed suggests scrapping the 2020 presidential debates.
[00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:26.552]  Because when you're running a corpse, you can't actually have it on television.
[00:08:28.786 --> 00:08:31.927]  Trump claims authority to issue order on mail-in votes.
[00:08:32.007 --> 00:08:32.708]  Executive order.
[00:08:32.728 --> 00:08:33.968]  Associated Press.
[00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.130]  Good news.
[00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.411]  Trump is registering more new votes than Democrats in key swing states.
[00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:43.852]  GatewayPundit.com.
[00:08:45.973 --> 00:08:49.955]  New Nevada law allows Democrats to enter nursing homes.
[00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:51.395]  Fox News is reporting.
[00:08:51.776 --> 00:08:54.637]  Vote for dementia patients without their signature.
[00:08:55.177 --> 00:08:57.138]  Actual video of it and the law.
[00:09:00.963 --> 00:09:01.963]  It's all political.
[00:09:02.043 --> 00:09:11.707]  New Mexico Dem Governor says protests are okay, but knocking on doors of registered voters is not the definition of hypocrisy and fraud.
[00:09:12.387 --> 00:09:14.328]  Trump questions Epstein's suicide.
[00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:16.368]  Was he killed?
[00:09:17.229 --> 00:09:19.429]  Explained what he was talking about with Ghislaine Maxwell.
[00:09:19.729 --> 00:09:20.570]  He said he wishes her well.
[00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.650]  He doesn't want her to die.
[00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.051]  He wants her to live a long time so she can testify.
[00:09:25.319 --> 00:09:32.532]  Trump fires CEO of Tennessee Valley Authority for outsourcing jobs to foreign workers after meeting with U.S.
[00:09:32.632 --> 00:09:33.294]  tech workers.
[00:09:33.334 --> 00:09:34.035]  Talk about listening.
[00:09:34.994 --> 00:09:35.594]  To your base.
[00:09:36.255 --> 00:09:42.119]  Singapore to tag visitors with electronic monitoring devices to ensure COVID-19 quarantine compliance.
[00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:47.523]  But don't worry, when you're in the country, they've got the database on your phone, which is the New World Order plan.
[00:09:48.184 --> 00:09:54.788]  Singapore will give residents wearable tokens that track the people they interact with in a new effort to contain COVID-19.
[00:09:56.189 --> 00:10:02.715]  And now city parks in Austin are making you register and give them a digital number at the beginning of this to be able to use Barton Springs and other areas.
[00:10:03.295 --> 00:10:10.722]  I am going to lead a march where we go into Barton Springs and we swim and we'll probably get arrested because we're not anti-foot, you know, shooting at police or something.
[00:10:11.022 --> 00:10:15.466]  But we've got to start having our civil rights movement, our human rights movement against this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:15.706 --> 00:10:19.530]  This is an admitted takeover where you have to be tracked to go outside.
[00:10:21.656 --> 00:10:23.216]  And remember who else was pushing this a month ago?
[00:10:23.236 --> 00:10:24.096]  This is Jerusalem Post.
[00:10:24.136 --> 00:10:28.037]  Benjamin Netanyahu suggests microchipping kids slammed by experts.
[00:10:29.217 --> 00:10:30.237]  Bill Gates is announcing it.
[00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:35.918]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on info.
[00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.699]  A big detailed report from Michael Snyder at Infowars.com.
[00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:42.339]  Suggest you read that and share that because it all ties into this.
[00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:43.120]  And look at this photo.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.140]  You're a TV viewer.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.020]  Radio listeners can go to Infowars.com.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.180]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.481]  Houston mayor orders $250 fines
[00:10:52.551 --> 00:11:07.777]  For people who refuse to wear a mask, and he wears a mask that says, I can't breathe on it, even though major studies are coming out, on record showing that they don't help you, they don't keep you safe, and they cause health problems.
[00:11:08.997 --> 00:11:09.878]  Like not being able to breathe.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:17.602]  We have video where doctors report pharmacies are refusing to fill HCQ totally legal prescriptions.
[00:11:17.763 --> 00:11:21.784]  And Ohio and Michigan have reversed bans on it after outcry by doctors.
[00:11:21.804 --> 00:11:24.805]  But now the pharmacies are good little globalists.
[00:11:24.865 --> 00:11:29.667]  They're going to refuse the people with medical degrees because Bill Gates said so.
[00:11:30.287 --> 00:11:31.868]  He's not a doctor, but he does run them.
[00:11:34.022 --> 00:11:37.165]  AP, Spain's new wave of infections hits the young middle age.
[00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:38.786]  You read of the statistics, it's all made up.
[00:11:38.806 --> 00:11:43.710]  FDA shifting standards for Chinese face mask fuel confusion.
[00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:46.412]  I can't effing breathe under this thing.
[00:11:46.532 --> 00:11:48.654]  LSU linebacker identifies flaw.
[00:11:48.754 --> 00:11:49.134]  Flaw?
[00:11:49.434 --> 00:11:52.397]  It's actually a space helmet in new coronavirus helmets.
[00:11:53.778 --> 00:11:57.261]  It's a space helmet without an oxygen tube.
[00:11:57.981 --> 00:12:02.305]  But if they can get us to wear a bag over our head and asphyxiate ourselves, why not?
[00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:05.300]  You know they're laughing at you.
[00:12:07.802 --> 00:12:16.589]  Meanwhile, Trump says, crazy Nancy Pelosi, slow rolling coronavirus aid, only interested in bailing out radical leftists, which she admits, she says, everybody else is collateral damage.
[00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.072]  The leader of the American Communist Party has endorsed Biden.
[00:12:22.114 --> 00:12:24.736]  Then of course, the really big news is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:25.597 --> 00:12:27.578]  There is a major move to crash the dollar.
[00:12:27.598 --> 00:12:29.280]  I'll explain what's behind that and how to stop it.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.041]  And yes, we're fiat.
[00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:31.702]  Yes, we're over.
[00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:35.955]  Financial territory that we shouldn't be.
[00:12:35.975 --> 00:12:45.343]  But I'm going to explain the big picture and what's really going on and why they have all these so-called conservatives out there saying America's over, the dollar's dead, you know, everything's going to collapse.
[00:12:46.003 --> 00:12:50.487]  It's because they're invested in China and they're invested with the globalists, who's even more inflated than us.
[00:12:50.987 --> 00:12:52.909]  So I'll be explaining all that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:53.229 --> 00:12:55.171]  Back into the hydroxychloroquine area.
[00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.193]  You're going to really need to see these articles.
[00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:09.483]  COVID-19, Dr. Zelenko, 150,000 Americans and many more around the world are dead because HCQ stood in the way of making trillions for Fauci, Gates, and others.
[00:13:10.763 --> 00:13:17.627]  These two charts should land Dr. Fauci in prison and shows the countries that use hydroxychloroquine had almost no deaths.
[00:13:17.988 --> 00:13:26.673]  Those that didn't use it had the highest deaths because it is a zinc deficiency in the cells, which the NIH website admits.
[00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:35.678]  Exclusive New York Health Commissioner Zucker won't provide number of elderly who went from nursing homes and then died in hospitals.
[00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:40.843]  Reportedly the only state not to gather this data, but we know they had the most deaths of any state in the nursing homes.
[00:13:41.684 --> 00:13:43.146]  The land with no face mask.
[00:13:44.332 --> 00:13:54.364]  Daily Mail, Holland's top scientists say there's no solid evidence coverings work, that they actually spread the disease and make you sick, and, well, but then that's what the science shows.
[00:13:54.725 --> 00:13:57.989]  And of course they have some of the lowest numbers in the world, just like Sweden.
[00:13:59.791 --> 00:14:00.832]  But it's an act of submission.
[00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.250]  Unbelievable.
[00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.611]  A new interview, Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:11.252]  claims, he doesn't claim, it's right there in the documents, Dr. Fauci will make millions on coronavirus vaccine and owns half the patent.
[00:14:11.792 --> 00:14:13.392]  We reported that six months ago, folks.
[00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:29.315]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation own at least three patents, two of them with Fauci, on a COVID-19 type Chimaera virus that's been developed for animals, but in the patent it says will work in humans as well.
[00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.151]  Oh, turns out they've already been doing some secret testing.
[00:14:33.872 --> 00:14:45.580]  Las Vegas gambler removed from famous Fort Queens casino in handcuffs after he went in without wearing a mask, but the illegal aliens come across with drug-resistant TB and a million point four die, but that's no big deal.
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.342]  The police want a virtue signal and grab someone not submitting properly.
[00:14:52.571 --> 00:14:53.853]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:53.913 --> 00:14:54.433]  Lockdown 2.0.
[00:14:55.314 --> 00:14:58.138]  Looks like harsher rules, deeper confusion.
[00:14:58.818 --> 00:15:03.664]  They're now admitting that Australia and Spain will be the model for the United States next.
[00:15:04.165 --> 00:15:07.368]  And they're going to be coming in your homes with the contact tracers.
[00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.675]  To the same group that says abolish the police, though we'll have the police do their dirty work.
[00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.996]  And the UN says, oh, we're in for a rocky ride.
[00:15:17.516 --> 00:15:18.537]  Oh, it's only going to get worse.
[00:15:18.577 --> 00:15:19.918]  Coronavirus will never go away.
[00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:31.406]  Give up all your rights because they can take any death statistic they want and add it and rise COVID or lower COVID to lock you down when they want and make you accept total tracking, total control, total enslavement.
[00:15:31.967 --> 00:15:35.790]  We're going to go through more of this when we come back.
[00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.953]  I've only covered two of the stats I have.
[00:15:41.557 --> 00:15:52.485]  Seven, eight other stacks here, and I think what I'll do is next segment, I'll finish up the hydroxychloroquine and the COVID-19 worldwide martial law lockdown news, and then I'll get into the police.
[00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:54.383]  Stand down news.
[00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:55.883]  Then I'll get into the U.N.
[00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:57.204]  power grab takeover news.
[00:15:57.584 --> 00:15:59.405]  And I'll get into the election power grab news.
[00:15:59.765 --> 00:16:00.846]  The election fraud news.
[00:16:01.566 --> 00:16:07.129]  And then at the bottom of the hour, the biggest new threat, the plan that's now admitted to crash the U.S.
[00:16:07.169 --> 00:16:08.290]  dollar, destroy U.S.
[00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.691]  dominance forever, and put communist China and the E.U.
[00:16:10.711 --> 00:16:11.411]  in the driver's seat.
[00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:15.794]  America and the world fighting against a new dark age of globalist tyranny.
[00:16:16.354 --> 00:16:17.615]  This couldn't be more critical.
[00:16:17.955 --> 00:16:19.636]  I'm Alex Jones, faithful to humanity.
[00:16:19.656 --> 00:16:20.016]  Stay with us.
[00:16:22.406 --> 00:16:25.609]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:27.891]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:16:28.592 --> 00:16:48.730]  And what I'm going to do for the rest of this segment is read through these headlines and break down what our enemies in the New World Order are doing and how they're building this giant cashless society system that tracks our every move and controls where we can do and what we can do according to
[00:16:51.112 --> 00:16:57.397]  Social engineering, which is designed to only tighten the noose further.
[00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:09.486]  And so the more that we comply, the more that we submit, the worse things get.
[00:17:09.587 --> 00:17:20.155]  That's why they're announcing right now, oh, the UN's advising Australia and Spain on level four lockdown.
[00:17:21.837 --> 00:17:46.081]  And so the very bioweapons labs, the very UN program that dumped this out on the planet, that owns the patents to the vaccines, that stand to get all this power and money and control, are the very people that then censor all these medical doctors and all these scientists around the world that are simply coming out and reporting what's known real medical science.
[00:17:46.681 --> 00:17:49.002]  But see, that known consensus
[00:17:50.748 --> 00:18:10.816]  By the actual professionals is under attack by the big tech technocracy that's merged with big pharma that is turning doctors into nothing but janitors who will oversee the robots and the computers and the AI systems that are programmed by the eugenicist to carry out the orderly extermination of the people of the earth.
[00:18:13.197 --> 00:18:18.859]  And so we've got a giant planetary Tuskegee level experiment
[00:18:24.246 --> 00:18:45.635]  Going on against humanity right now, and you've got all these compliant sheeple that don't want to hear about how Fauci lied about everything, that don't want to hear about how COVID was made in a lab, who don't want to hear about the contact tracing and the apps on the phones, and who don't want to hear about the digital microchips and digital tattoos.
[00:18:47.603 --> 00:19:02.535]  They actually think that by submitting they are part of the power structure and that they are basking in the glow of the system when they're nothing but useful, idiot, schmuck, sucker, Marx, fools, sheep.
[00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:08.340]  So again, when they come up to you and say, wear your mask, don't respond back.
[00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:12.763]  Because they're expecting you to do that, then they start yelling at you, don't listen.
[00:19:13.324 --> 00:19:16.907]  When they say, oh, you have nothing to say, you say, yes, I don't believe in cruelty to animals.
[00:19:19.352 --> 00:19:24.815]  And when they get mad at that, and say, what are you saying, I'm a bitch?
[00:19:24.835 --> 00:19:27.777]  Are you saying I'm a... No, I'm saying you're a sheep.
[00:19:29.398 --> 00:19:46.267]  Because when the system organizes the sheep in mob rule, in a giant stampede of lemmings, of cattle, to overrun us, we have a responsibility to tell those dumb cows that they better get out of your way.
[00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:50.562]  Because they're not going to listen to reason, they're not going to listen to science, they're not going to listen to the facts.
[00:19:51.543 --> 00:19:59.205]  They're going to listen when they throw hot coffee on you when you break their nose.
[00:20:01.146 --> 00:20:06.768]  They're going to listen when they come to your table and try to embarrass you when you go over and get in their face.
[00:20:07.068 --> 00:20:09.469]  Because that's what it takes is standing up to them.
[00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:11.890]  When you bow down to sheeple,
[00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:17.432]  When you grovel to sheeple, it only makes them more emboldened.
[00:20:19.173 --> 00:20:27.476]  It only makes them more out of control, because finally, they believe they can go out and have personal power over people, because they believe in the power of the sheep.
[00:20:29.857 --> 00:20:31.218]  Now, LaCruz is great.
[00:20:31.278 --> 00:20:32.478]  I kind of get in the zone here.
[00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:40.422]  And during the break, I was going to get some documents and do some research, and I got talked to in the hall by my son.
[00:20:42.051 --> 00:20:48.712]  Who brought up another story to me, and then I go back, he works here now, and he was like, look at this article, look at this story, and I just can't do it.
[00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:58.674]  Because I'm totally in the zone about this COVID thing, and I was loaded for bear to come in here and cover that.
[00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:01.774]  And now I just got distracted off.
[00:21:03.235 --> 00:21:06.195]  The rule is, don't talk to me in the hallway, folks, everybody knows that.
[00:21:06.795 --> 00:21:10.096]  And I begged Rex to stop it, so I'll do it on air, and maybe he'll hear it that way.
[00:21:18.666 --> 00:21:22.228]  You know, I had my attention span destroyed by television, but it's nothing compared to the young people now.
[00:21:23.629 --> 00:21:27.931]  And, you know, we sit here and we watch the enemy just wreck our minds and turn us against each other.
[00:21:27.991 --> 00:21:28.932]  It's just so damn sad.
[00:21:28.952 --> 00:21:33.134]  And, you know, the more prepared I get for a broadcast, the harder it is to do.
[00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:39.018]  Because I could talk for hours and hours and hours about one of these stories.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.601]  And I just can't do it anymore.
[00:21:48.663 --> 00:22:14.507]  People think that I should be really happy right now because I've been vindicated, and I'm not happy about that because I'm sitting here watching scientific evil take over society, take over civilization, and I know it's all 100% certified and the enemies that are running it say they want to kill me and my family.
[00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:23.396]  And even the most hardcore people that are awake, myself included, still don't take this as seriously as we should.
[00:22:26.358 --> 00:22:30.081]  It is outrageous to get into Barton Springs City Park.
[00:22:30.621 --> 00:22:34.885]  It's a damned up spring they got downtown that I've been swimming in since I was born.
[00:22:36.325 --> 00:22:51.057]  That you've got to give them contact tracing info and your phone number and your driver's license so you can be contact traced when they test somebody else and then they come up as infected.
[00:22:51.137 --> 00:22:58.463]  They can then count 15 random people around you under NIH UN guidelines and then you get counted as having COVID.
[00:22:59.684 --> 00:23:05.329]  And again, it's all based on fraud because the system is a fraud and it wants you to accept total fraud.
[00:23:06.704 --> 00:23:07.765]  And so what do we do?
[00:23:08.725 --> 00:23:10.987]  I call for the lifeguards to all be fired.
[00:23:11.087 --> 00:23:13.589]  I call for Barton Springs to have its fences torn down.
[00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.771]  I call for the bureaucracy to be shut down.
[00:23:17.752 --> 00:23:19.473]  I call for the mayor to be gotten rid of.
[00:23:19.653 --> 00:23:20.594]  You know who isn't essential?
[00:23:20.774 --> 00:23:21.295]  That mayor.
[00:23:22.295 --> 00:23:27.619]  Anytime leftist globalists get control of your city, they ruin everything.
[00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:29.200]  They call in the homeless.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.321]  They sell the fentanyl.
[00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:31.982]  There's feces everywhere.
[00:23:32.002 --> 00:23:35.345]  And then there's all these little city employees
[00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:41.914]  That line up and go along with the bureaucracy, including the police more and more around the country and the world.
[00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:45.997]  They enforce the fake mask ordinances and they enforce all the crap.
[00:23:46.157 --> 00:23:47.238]  They're not getting rid of the police.
[00:23:48.519 --> 00:23:51.921]  They're getting rid of the police doing regular police work now.
[00:23:53.382 --> 00:24:00.927]  Because now they're going to swing into being social workers that control and run our lives.
[00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.690]  And that's all.
[00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:11.921]  It's about controlling you, and when they say jump, you ask how high.
[00:24:12.721 --> 00:24:15.262]  And so again, everything is about noncompliance now.
[00:24:16.282 --> 00:24:16.782]  I'm serious.
[00:24:17.702 --> 00:24:19.203]  They've broken the social contract.
[00:24:20.143 --> 00:24:22.444]  All blue cities and blue states are not American.
[00:24:22.484 --> 00:24:23.184]  They're globalists.
[00:24:23.384 --> 00:24:24.424]  They're enemies of the country.
[00:24:24.464 --> 00:24:25.325]  They don't believe it should exist.
[00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:30.566]  And they're nothing but criminals trying to bring it down, and they see us as collateral damage, as Nancy Pelosi said.
[00:24:30.766 --> 00:24:31.267]  And that's it.
[00:24:32.427 --> 00:24:34.708]  I'm gonna try to get refocused and come back.
[00:24:35.168 --> 00:24:35.548]  Stay with us.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:45.842]  Remember, this broadcast only exists because of your support, your word of mouth, and your prayers.
[00:24:47.902 --> 00:24:48.963]  Thank you again for joining us.
[00:24:49.063 --> 00:24:50.283]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:51.183 --> 00:24:51.503]  All right.
[00:24:53.644 --> 00:24:58.965]  This is a very complex issue if you get into all the minutiae.
[00:25:00.245 --> 00:25:01.786]  And I've studied the minutiae in depth.
[00:25:02.662 --> 00:25:05.324]  I've had the top experts on over the years, you've heard them.
[00:25:05.885 --> 00:25:15.312]  And you're your own experts on this, but there is a consensus in the Trump White House and with Larry Kudlow, and there's a consensus here in InfoWars.
[00:25:15.953 --> 00:25:19.315]  And I intend to open the phones up and have you call in if you disagree or agree.
[00:25:20.396 --> 00:25:23.659]  But here's the final equation.
[00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:24.960]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:25:28.638 --> 00:25:54.507]  If you got an old cow you really like and you're not ever going to send it off to get it butchered, but one day it wanders out into the road and gets hit by an 18-wheeler and it breaks its neck, you might as well grab it, drag it over to the bottom of the tractor, cut it up, and, you know, feed it to your dogs as dog food or eat it yourself.
[00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:57.748]  I mean, that's really the thinking here.
[00:25:58.424 --> 00:26:00.684]  And that's kind of a crude analogy that just popped in my head.
[00:26:01.065 --> 00:26:10.987]  There's much better allegories you can come up with, but... I mean, my dad's dad would actually get attached to certain cows and would never sell them.
[00:26:11.207 --> 00:26:16.028]  And then the joke was, by the time he died of cancer, he had a whole herd of cows and wouldn't sell any of them.
[00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:17.628]  And they'd come over and he'd pet them and stuff.
[00:26:17.648 --> 00:26:28.270]  We'd feed them range cubes, but... Let me just pull back here for a minute.
[00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:36.711]  You know, if I just rattle off stuff, it doesn't really have an effect, does it?
[00:26:41.432 --> 00:26:41.932]  No, it doesn't.
[00:26:48.753 --> 00:26:49.694]  I don't know what to say anymore.
[00:26:51.394 --> 00:26:56.455]  You know, the public is so ignorant about how the world works.
[00:27:00.757 --> 00:27:18.070]  That these criminals can pull off these things against us and then we're unable to even respond to it because the public doesn't even understand the basics of how the economy, how finance, how markets work.
[00:27:22.734 --> 00:27:30.340]  We're witnessing a devastating planetary takeover right now by the most nasty people you can imagine.
[00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:43.632]  And the fact that they've got every major channel out there, not just here but all over the world, saying America's over, America sucks, America's demoralized, the dollar's gonna plunge, the U.S.
[00:27:43.652 --> 00:27:57.238]  won't even be a co-superpower to China, it will descend into civil war, and to know that that's their plan, and the average American isn't 100% behind the president trying to stop it, is nauseating.
[00:27:59.608 --> 00:28:09.374]  It's like you're flying in an airplane, and one pilot has a heart attack and dies, and the other pilot knows how to land the plane, and crazy people on board want to kill the pilot.
[00:28:10.034 --> 00:28:16.658]  Or you're in a life raft, and there's crazy people on board that are trying to punch holes in it while sharks are swimming around you.
[00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:25.864]  All because they've been taught it's cute, it's fun, it's fashionable to plunge the dollar, to burn down the police station, to destroy the country.
[00:28:26.124 --> 00:28:27.405]  And it's so dangerous!
[00:28:30.646 --> 00:28:38.290]  So I'm going to start over next segment because I'm going to need that map on the wall I've been asking for of their fake, you know, COVID system, but we'll, we'll do it.
[00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.070]  We'll do it next sec.
[00:28:39.991 --> 00:28:40.211]  Now.
[00:28:44.753 --> 00:28:45.833]  I may just have to leave today.
[00:28:45.893 --> 00:28:47.114]  This is not drama stuff.
[00:28:47.194 --> 00:28:48.515]  I think I'm going off air.
[00:28:48.855 --> 00:28:49.515]  This conference done.
[00:28:49.535 --> 00:28:50.976]  I mean, seriously.
[00:28:54.518 --> 00:28:54.718]  Wow.
[00:28:55.418 --> 00:28:55.878]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:56.158 --> 00:28:56.999]  Um, let's go ahead and.
[00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:01.529]  Go to this special report.
[00:29:02.369 --> 00:29:03.090]  We'll see what happens.
[00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:08.811]  I'm gonna have to push back other graphs I have for next time because I gotta do this whole graph on COVID-19 here that I needed.
[00:29:16.773 --> 00:29:18.093]  Let's play Clip 14.
[00:29:18.633 --> 00:29:18.873]  Thanks.
[00:29:19.713 --> 00:29:20.293]  Clip 14.
[00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:22.474]  And then after that, whatever you like.
[00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:49.072]  We learned that Mueller and the Clintons and all of them were involved suppressing information about themselves and how they were running these child molesting blackmail rings that was being managed by the Clinton Obama era FBI at the top.
[00:29:49.613 --> 00:29:55.436]  And we also in the documents learned that they tried to have the FBI implicate Donald John Trump
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:09.125]  Because, as we've told you years ago, he was a confidential informant to the FBI in Palm Beach saying that, the word is, Epstein is engaged in criminal activity with underage girls.
[00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:10.986]  He was a fixture in Palm Beach.
[00:30:12.226 --> 00:30:14.307]  I had a falling out with him a long time ago.
[00:30:14.327 --> 00:30:16.268]  I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years.
[00:30:16.528 --> 00:30:26.572]  Epstein was actually banned from Mar-a-Lago, according to court documents obtained by Inside Edition, after Epstein was accused of sexually assaulting an underage girl at the club.
[00:30:26.952 --> 00:30:29.613]  Everybody knows Donald Trump doesn't like little girls.
[00:30:29.653 --> 00:30:33.013]  Donald Trump likes intimidating bombshell females.
[00:30:33.714 --> 00:30:37.615]  But these pedophiles, they want to suck the energy off these little girls, little boys.
[00:30:37.655 --> 00:30:39.715]  They want to be creepy.
[00:30:40.275 --> 00:30:41.856]  Weinstein's really gross.
[00:30:41.876 --> 00:30:46.717]  He likes to have underneath girls, like, clean, reportedly, like, skin growths under his belly.
[00:30:46.777 --> 00:30:48.737]  And he has a vagina as well, reportedly.
[00:30:49.297 --> 00:30:51.618]  He's a hermaphrodite.
[00:30:51.638 --> 00:30:53.738]  I mean, can you imagine all of this?
[00:30:53.758 --> 00:30:55.539]  He, like, makes, like, 15-year-old girls.
[00:30:56.576 --> 00:31:00.218]  Is it true, sir, that you have what's been described as an egg-shaped penis?
[00:31:00.238 --> 00:31:07.261]  Epstein took my sexual innocence in front of a wall of framed photographs of him shaking hands and smiling at celebrities and political leaders.
[00:31:26.556 --> 00:31:28.297]  I was only 15 years old.
[00:31:29.118 --> 00:31:32.080]  You don't get in the globalist club unless you're really screwed up.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.742]  They're fallen, they're diseased, they're inbred globalists.
[00:31:36.623 --> 00:31:38.404]  And that's why they don't like those of us that aren't.
[00:31:38.845 --> 00:31:41.126]  Why they want to make us twisted and fallen and ugly like them.
[00:31:42.447 --> 00:31:44.328]  Get the British royalty all inbred as well.
[00:31:44.448 --> 00:31:47.451]  So it's all a bunch of inbred hunchbacked demons.
[00:31:48.547 --> 00:31:50.628]  Who get all the power because they want the power.
[00:31:50.648 --> 00:31:52.169]  Because they don't have the power.
[00:31:52.670 --> 00:32:00.375]  Within hours of Jeffrey Epstein's apparent suicide, President Trump was retweeting a conspiracy theory linking Bill Clinton to his death.
[00:32:00.915 --> 00:32:04.217]  It was immediately picked up by Russian state media going viral.
[00:32:04.797 --> 00:32:08.360]  A Clinton spokesperson calling the tweet ridiculous and of course not true.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.802]  Got a lot of problems coming up in my opinion with the famous island.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.421]  With Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:32:13.561 --> 00:32:14.202]  A lot of problems.
[00:32:14.222 --> 00:32:15.803]  You think it was over the line?
[00:32:15.863 --> 00:32:18.066]  I don't know because I don't know her, but it was nasty.
[00:32:18.266 --> 00:32:21.028]  You raised the question of Jeffrey Epstein in your remarks in the Q&A.
[00:32:21.089 --> 00:32:24.112]  I think he's got a problem.
[00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:27.074]  I don't know, but that island was really a cesspool.
[00:32:27.095 --> 00:32:28.096]  There's no question about it.
[00:32:28.136 --> 00:32:29.497]  Just ask Prince Andrew.
[00:32:30.057 --> 00:32:30.818]  He'll tell you about it.
[00:32:30.878 --> 00:32:33.221]  I really like how Trump's attacking now.
[00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:34.862]  Don't wait until October.
[00:32:36.033 --> 00:32:37.634]  Attack, launch everything now.
[00:32:38.214 --> 00:32:43.938]  Maxwell is in prison, and so a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn in powerful people.
[00:32:44.138 --> 00:32:46.259]  Do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men?
[00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:47.660]  How do you see that working out?
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:48.600]  I don't know.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.341]  I haven't really been following it too much.
[00:32:50.482 --> 00:32:51.442]  I just wish her well.
[00:32:51.542 --> 00:32:53.663]  He said he wishes Ghislaine Maxwell well?
[00:32:54.044 --> 00:32:55.945]  You really don't want Trump wishing you well.
[00:32:57.346 --> 00:33:01.208]  When Trump starts wishing you well, you should get a little angel of death flapping above you.
[00:33:03.424 --> 00:33:04.084]  Alright, folks.
[00:33:04.144 --> 00:33:06.146]  Again, I'm not throwing a temper tantrum here.
[00:33:06.266 --> 00:33:22.195]  I am physically sick of looking at Fauci and Birx and Hillary and Biden and the New World Order and all their criminal activity and how they admit they're closing a tourniquet around our neck and how we'll never come out of lockdown and how they're going to put implantable chips in us.
[00:33:22.715 --> 00:33:25.117]  It just... I'm seriously pissed.
[00:33:25.157 --> 00:33:30.040]  And now they've shut down parks all over Austin and say they've got to get registered and be COVID-tracked to do it.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.041]  They're coming to our houses next!
[00:33:33.393 --> 00:33:34.074]  That's it, man.
[00:33:34.194 --> 00:33:35.415]  I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[00:33:36.055 --> 00:33:36.456]  That's it.
[00:33:36.656 --> 00:33:38.537]  It's time for serious civil disobedience.
[00:33:39.278 --> 00:33:42.501]  We should just open the phones up about what we should do with plans, and I'm doing it today.
[00:33:43.562 --> 00:33:44.082]  I'm done.
[00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:45.483]  I'm done, man.
[00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:46.464]  I'm done.
[00:33:46.824 --> 00:33:48.806]  You people want a damn war, you're gonna get one.
[00:33:49.366 --> 00:33:55.752]  I'm not gonna sit here while you chain us up and then have your way with us, you globalist enemies, you pieces of criminal filth!
[00:33:56.969 --> 00:34:00.433]  See, used to I let myself blow up on air, and instead I'm going to do it off air.
[00:34:00.453 --> 00:34:01.454]  No, I'm going to do it on air.
[00:34:01.955 --> 00:34:03.997]  And then I'm going to do it physically out in the streets!
[00:34:04.618 --> 00:34:05.479]  You murderer!
[00:34:05.659 --> 00:34:06.600]  You Bill Gates!
[00:34:07.221 --> 00:34:08.362]  Oh, you murderer!
[00:34:08.742 --> 00:34:10.464]  Bill Gates, you're going to burn!
[00:34:11.626 --> 00:34:14.809]  Every time we feel overwhelmed by the scientific terror...
[00:34:15.697 --> 00:34:18.039]  That the New World Order Illuminati are launching against this.
[00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:20.641]  Remember, they want to be God, but they're not God.
[00:34:21.342 --> 00:34:23.824]  And their plans will always end up being destroyed in the end.
[00:34:24.244 --> 00:34:25.645]  But we the faithful have to go through it.
[00:34:25.665 --> 00:34:26.526]  That's part of the test.
[00:34:27.467 --> 00:34:29.168]  And so pray to God for guidance.
[00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:31.950]  Pray for God for protection.
[00:34:32.371 --> 00:34:37.095]  But also pray for God for the strength and the will to be leaders and to stand against this.
[00:34:39.673 --> 00:34:46.516]  Last night, this morning, and getting in here to the office doing research for the show, I physically got angry and I've been trying to control it.
[00:34:46.836 --> 00:34:54.799]  But you know, it's normal to get angry when a group of multinational banks that have created the debt bubble are artificially putting us in
[00:34:56.363 --> 00:35:03.366]  To a collapse mode to have a global reset, which they will then blame on COVID-19 that they themselves released.
[00:35:04.026 --> 00:35:09.949]  COVID-19 isn't causing the global depression, the global reset, out of which the new global cashless society is openly emerging.
[00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:12.230]  Exploding on the scene.
[00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:21.133]  COVID-19 hysteria is the well thought out Rockefeller, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation plans that are public.
[00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:22.814]  That's what's so incredible.
[00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:27.312]  For the emergence of what they've already beta tested in Communist China.
[00:35:28.393 --> 00:35:29.514]  And across the Western world.
[00:35:30.975 --> 00:35:35.620]  And so when you read headlines like, mass starvation, millions dying because of COVID.
[00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:38.382]  COVID didn't kill them, the lockdown did.
[00:35:40.364 --> 00:35:42.106]  COVID causing mass suicides.
[00:35:42.186 --> 00:35:44.508]  No, the lockdown caused mass suicides.
[00:35:44.568 --> 00:35:46.150]  And that's all a fact!
[00:35:49.324 --> 00:35:52.728]  A fact they overblew the death numbers 25 times what they said it'd be.
[00:35:53.049 --> 00:35:57.494]  A fact they used death numbers for all these other people that died of other things, even in the little shrunken number.
[00:35:57.775 --> 00:36:00.097]  It's fake, upon fake, upon fake.
[00:36:01.479 --> 00:36:04.102]  Just like the fiat currencies they put out.
[00:36:04.142 --> 00:36:05.024]  So let me break this down.
[00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:25.795]  It is very one-dimensional of these different so-called conservative media pundits, financial experts, that go out and say, America is going down, the dollar's dead, it's all over, Trump's done a terrible job, the stimulus packages were the wrong thing to do, the dollar's going down, it's over.
[00:36:29.332 --> 00:36:34.235]  Because we already inflated the currency past the point of no return before Trump got in.
[00:36:34.495 --> 00:36:40.238]  We already had hundreds of trillions of dollars of fake debt globally that the new world order had signed us onto.
[00:36:40.739 --> 00:36:42.059]  They'd already done it.
[00:36:42.139 --> 00:36:43.640]  They were looking for the reset.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.701]  They were going to have the bio release.
[00:36:45.741 --> 00:36:47.082]  They were going to have COVID-19.
[00:36:47.302 --> 00:36:48.883]  They were going to have the reset under Hillary.
[00:36:49.203 --> 00:36:50.064]  They now admit that.
[00:36:51.544 --> 00:37:03.308]  They admit it's a drill to blame the collapse and the starvation and the civil unrest and the death on the COVID while they come out in every financial publication and say the dollar's dead, America's over.
[00:37:04.749 --> 00:37:11.451]  Whoever ends up with the EU over-inflating its currency, the Communist Chinese over-inflating their currency, they're all doing it.
[00:37:12.872 --> 00:37:18.274]  Whoever ends up with the dominant global currency, who can flood the world with the most of their currency,
[00:37:19.127 --> 00:37:27.430]  Who can be on top when it all goes down, will be in charge, like after World War II in Bretton Woods, for another 70, 80 years.
[00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.531]  And you can say it's a corrupt system, you can say it's fiat.
[00:37:30.711 --> 00:37:39.135]  The very Federal Reserve that set it up, is getting rid of our hegemonic power now, to give it to the CHICOMS and themselves completely!
[00:37:40.715 --> 00:37:41.596]  They're done with us!
[00:37:42.516 --> 00:37:44.697]  Like Darth Sidious done with Count Dooku!
[00:37:45.957 --> 00:37:47.498]  We're being flushed down the toilet!
[00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:56.953]  And then, America will completely collapse into hell on earth, the likes of which you've never seen, and they've already built the fire and lit the match.
[00:37:59.354 --> 00:38:10.459]  Oh, race war did it, and COVID did it, and America's systemic problems, and America's done, and America's finished, and America's rotten, and America was never good, and America was never great, it'll never be great.
[00:38:10.919 --> 00:38:15.061]  And all the headlines about the evils of the country, and how it just was, you know,
[00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:18.523]  48 years old and it's over and it's gone.
[00:38:18.563 --> 00:38:20.625]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, L.A.
[00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:27.510]  Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, Time Magazine, Austin American Statesman, CBS News, NBC News, ABC News.
[00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.211]  We're done.
[00:38:28.251 --> 00:38:28.771]  We're over.
[00:38:28.831 --> 00:38:29.312]  We suck.
[00:38:29.332 --> 00:38:29.952]  We're terrible.
[00:38:32.314 --> 00:38:43.423]  That's globalist, multinational corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU, Hollywood, all of it, about to bring us down, take us into massive, total, complete debt.
[00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:46.040]  That we never emerge from again.
[00:38:46.621 --> 00:38:54.770]  And now COVID tracking on our phones, that really track us in live time, and they admit, even in the Wall Street Journal, everything you do is put in a secret credit score.
[00:38:55.190 --> 00:39:02.658]  What porn you visit, who you talk to, what you do, what you eat, what you drink, and they share it all illegally, and this is their coming out.
[00:39:03.058 --> 00:39:19.433]  Where you've got to sign up to go to the park or to leave your house and all these idiots wear their masks and get into it like they're heroes because they're a bunch of lazy schmucks that let us get into this position to begin with and now they want to take us down with them all the way.
[00:39:22.595 --> 00:39:23.176]  So that's it.
[00:39:25.498 --> 00:39:27.059]  They're economically imploding us.
[00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:28.380]  They're culturally imploding us.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.802]  They're spiritually imploding us.
[00:39:31.684 --> 00:39:33.364]  COVID House of Cards collapsing.
[00:39:33.824 --> 00:39:36.225]  Fauci called out over vaccine royalties.
[00:39:36.625 --> 00:39:39.766]  He didn't just lie about everything.
[00:39:39.786 --> 00:39:44.127]  He didn't just run the Wuhan lab, basically.
[00:39:44.507 --> 00:39:46.247]  He makes the money off of it with who?
[00:39:46.807 --> 00:39:47.647]  Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:39:49.588 --> 00:39:52.768]  But you hear, oh, Bill Gates is a philanthropist.
[00:39:53.048 --> 00:39:58.770]  His money went tax-free 30 years ago, and he's quintupled it since then.
[00:39:59.050 --> 00:39:59.950]  Just what we know of.
[00:40:03.004 --> 00:40:03.845]  Same thing with Warren Buffett.
[00:40:04.965 --> 00:40:16.592]  Because the money's meant to be used in an alternate global government to carry out depopulation because they've taken the world over by fiat fraud a trillion times bigger than Bernie Madoff.
[00:40:16.852 --> 00:40:21.675]  So imagine if Bernie Madoff controlled governments and armies and militaries and national health services.
[00:40:22.875 --> 00:40:30.920]  When he was getting ready to bring his Ponzi scheme down, he would just release a bioweapon and use that as the cover for the whole new digital system
[00:40:32.247 --> 00:40:54.382]  Where your planetary medical tracking code on your phone or in a chip in your skin or on a bracelet or a face scan or a thumbprint is tied to everything you do in your job and where your digital money is put in if you perform the task, not just of your job, but socially how you're supposed to behave.
[00:40:54.902 --> 00:40:59.465]  Take your eight-year-old son, have his testicles chopped off, $100,000 put in your credit box.
[00:40:59.485 --> 00:41:00.346]  They're talking about this.
[00:41:01.872 --> 00:41:08.735]  You decide to commit euthanasia at a certain point in five years to lower the carbon footprint of the earth, you'll be a hero a million credits.
[00:41:10.816 --> 00:41:11.736]  This is their plan!
[00:41:12.157 --> 00:41:13.957]  This isn't some science fiction dystopia!
[00:41:17.179 --> 00:41:21.941]  Because we're like trained seals, that for fish, we'll do whatever we're told.
[00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:26.523]  Instead of... See, an animal doesn't understand the confines it's in.
[00:41:26.543 --> 00:41:28.164]  It doesn't understand the false reality.
[00:41:29.502 --> 00:41:31.329]  You as a human can change your environment.
[00:41:31.831 --> 00:41:34.521]  And you can understand that they're putting us into a cage of false...
[00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:38.012]  It's being removed where there's no economy but the New World Order.
[00:42:07.657 --> 00:42:11.540]  Where all of the district attorneys are appointed by Soros and the New World Order.
[00:42:12.881 --> 00:42:14.622]  That's how they legalize pedophilia.
[00:42:15.003 --> 00:42:16.924]  That's how they legalize open Satanism.
[00:42:17.225 --> 00:42:18.866]  Because they are the law.
[00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:20.087]  They are the man.
[00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:26.031]  And they're just muscling in on the officers themselves to kill whatever pro-America culture was left there.
[00:42:26.292 --> 00:42:30.935]  To break their will, run off the good guys, and open the slots for their bad guys to go in.
[00:42:31.155 --> 00:42:32.717]  So the real reign of terror starts.
[00:42:34.158 --> 00:42:43.107]  And if they're successful in those phases and we're actually having to fight the security apparatus of the satanic New World Order, oh, we'll be the biggest criminals on earth fighting the police.
[00:42:43.768 --> 00:42:53.718]  Because they won't be the police then, they'll be the Stasi, they'll be the NKVD, they'll be the Gestapo, they'll be the sword of Satan.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.302]  And so the globalists are fighting over
[00:42:58.783 --> 00:42:59.944]  The security apparatus.
[00:43:00.865 --> 00:43:03.767]  Oh, they got good people to go along with the security apparatus.
[00:43:04.088 --> 00:43:09.292]  It violates our rights for the bitter good, because, you know, the good guys were in control of it, and that's how we stopped the bad guys.
[00:43:09.492 --> 00:43:22.424]  But notice now, the bad guys are almost in total control of a worldwide panoptagon surveillance system, the likes of which Hitler couldn't even dream of, and we're inches away from falling under the control
[00:43:23.965 --> 00:43:29.950]  of these individuals and the system that's in place to be able to go to the park, or have a job, or leave your house.
[00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:35.334]  And then, of course, if you can't leave your house, you're gonna lose your house, and you're gonna be homeless!
[00:43:37.947 --> 00:43:45.188]  But if you're not in the right club and you're homeless, a group of vigilantes are going to come by because the police have been defunded, and they're going to kill you.
[00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:50.550]  Because how they enforce the policing now is, you do what the globalists want, you get credits.
[00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.890]  You don't do what they want, you get nothing.
[00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.751]  Doesn't matter what you own, what you had, what you did.
[00:43:56.071 --> 00:43:57.791]  It's going to be taken away from you.
[00:43:58.051 --> 00:44:02.112]  You're going to live in a modern globalist prison, the likes of which the planet's never seen.
[00:44:02.412 --> 00:44:06.873]  The dystopia that we are entering is nothing like anyone has ever dreamed of.
[00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:17.148]  And the police all over the world, in most areas, are serving the New World Order and are proving themselves good Satanists.
[00:44:18.629 --> 00:44:28.758]  So we're caught between the globalists and the communists and the police and the constabulary that's groveling and saying, be nice to me, I'll get on my knees, I'll get on my belly, I'll arrest people for no mask.
[00:44:29.558 --> 00:44:33.482]  All right, Jesse Lee Peterson, who I haven't interviewed in years, he's super popular now.
[00:44:33.502 --> 00:44:36.484]  I remember when he was on Access TV when I was on there 25 years ago.
[00:44:37.065 --> 00:44:40.128]  We'd air his stuff in Austin, he'd play some of our stuff out in California.
[00:44:40.788 --> 00:44:44.812]  He's gonna be on air with us, coming up in the third hour.
[00:44:44.852 --> 00:44:46.153]  I wanna open the phones up, though.
[00:44:47.967 --> 00:44:53.328]  For segment three, four, and five of this hour, for a specific issue.
[00:44:55.669 --> 00:45:10.112]  Bill Gates is coming at you with vaccines they admit don't help you and that hurt almost everybody that take them, and that he's gonna have liability protection from, and he's having bureaucracies and governments put in systems to make you take it to get on an airplane, or rent a car, or have a job.
[00:45:11.032 --> 00:45:16.213]  So he's gonna assault you with tyranny and with a deadly vaccine that changes your very DNA.
[00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:18.226]  That's assault.
[00:45:18.406 --> 00:45:27.991]  If I tried to come to your house with a needle that, admittedly, a big percentage of the time would really hurt you, you'd have a right, if I tried to jab it in me, to physically defend yourself.
[00:45:29.972 --> 00:45:31.773]  But they're trying to blur the lines of all of that.
[00:45:31.793 --> 00:45:33.794]  We have to start discussing the rules of engagement here.
[00:45:35.254 --> 00:45:38.756]  Because this is assault, this is criminal, this is wrong.
[00:45:40.233 --> 00:45:44.515]  So here's the number to join us.
[00:45:44.535 --> 00:45:44.755]  877-789-2539.
[00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:45.275]  877-789-2539.
[00:45:45.655 --> 00:45:48.177]  And seriously, folks, we'll take like 10 calls.
[00:45:48.497 --> 00:45:49.537]  It's on that subject.
[00:45:49.877 --> 00:45:50.958]  What do we do about Bill Gates?
[00:45:51.018 --> 00:45:51.838]  What's the line in the sand?
[00:45:52.058 --> 00:45:59.042]  Or do we just tell him, you're my God, literally bend over and say, give me any shots you want, and have convulsions while he smiles at you and you die?
[00:45:59.822 --> 00:46:01.963]  I mean, do we just submit to him?
[00:46:02.003 --> 00:46:02.843]  And is he a God?
[00:46:03.204 --> 00:46:05.365]  And so he's our doctor that we can't say no to?
[00:46:05.405 --> 00:46:06.085]  He's our master?
[00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:07.819]  877-789-2539.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.973]  But here's why they banned Alex Jones.
[00:46:11.993 --> 00:46:13.016]  This video is three years old.
[00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:13.538]  Here it is.
[00:46:14.864 --> 00:46:17.746]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:46:17.806 --> 00:46:25.431]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:46:25.751 --> 00:46:29.013]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:30.514]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:32.735]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:46:32.996 --> 00:46:35.137]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:46:35.357 --> 00:46:36.418]  This is all confirmed.
[00:46:36.438 --> 00:46:37.378]  This is not a drill.
[00:46:37.558 --> 00:46:41.501]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:46:41.781 --> 00:46:43.221]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:46:43.341 --> 00:46:43.801]  Apple 100%.
[00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:49.842]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:46:50.302 --> 00:46:55.063]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:46:55.363 --> 00:46:56.224]  This is happening.
[00:46:56.244 --> 00:47:04.185]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:47:04.285 --> 00:47:10.186]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:47:10.606 --> 00:47:18.631]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[00:47:19.312 --> 00:47:23.014]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:47:23.315 --> 00:47:26.497]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:47:26.737 --> 00:47:33.842]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:47:34.082 --> 00:47:36.683]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:47:40.506 --> 00:47:47.768]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:48:04.588 --> 00:48:13.314]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:48:13.334 --> 00:48:18.218]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:48:18.598 --> 00:48:21.701]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[00:48:21.921 --> 00:48:23.502]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[00:48:23.702 --> 00:48:31.508]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:48:32.028 --> 00:48:38.756]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:44.562]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum, and it's being used against you.
[00:48:44.803 --> 00:48:49.528]  Only your full understanding of this TE will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:48:49.728 --> 00:48:51.630]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:48:51.711 --> 00:48:52.632]  Now break free!
[00:48:56.387 --> 00:49:05.658]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:49:05.698 --> 00:49:08.381]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:49:08.481 --> 00:49:12.386]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:49:17.324 --> 00:49:20.087]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:49:20.187 --> 00:49:21.288]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:49:21.308 --> 00:49:26.833]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouted to telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:49:26.873 --> 00:49:27.574]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:28.835]  Damn it!
[00:49:28.915 --> 00:49:29.236]  Why?
[00:49:29.996 --> 00:49:36.002]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:49:36.583 --> 00:49:39.746]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:49:42.517 --> 00:49:47.321]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:49:47.361 --> 00:49:48.322]  You decided, sir.
[00:49:48.382 --> 00:49:49.303]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:49:49.323 --> 00:49:50.724]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:49:50.984 --> 00:49:53.066]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:49:53.086 --> 00:49:54.467]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:49:54.888 --> 00:50:04.536]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:50:04.556 --> 00:50:04.756]  Cameras.
[00:50:04.776 --> 00:50:05.437]  We need cameras.
[00:50:05.737 --> 00:50:06.537]  How did this happen?
[00:50:07.178 --> 00:50:07.939]  Who's to blame?
[00:50:08.928 --> 00:50:11.552]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:50:11.572 --> 00:50:13.535]  They will be held accountable.
[00:50:13.936 --> 00:50:19.384]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:50:20.572 --> 00:50:22.353]  I know why you did it.
[00:50:22.553 --> 00:50:23.634]  I know you were afraid.
[00:50:23.654 --> 00:50:24.794]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:50:25.295 --> 00:50:25.795]  War?
[00:50:26.055 --> 00:50:26.495]  Terror?
[00:50:26.695 --> 00:50:27.316]  Disease?
[00:50:27.996 --> 00:50:34.359]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:50:34.419 --> 00:50:40.203]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:50:40.823 --> 00:50:46.986]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:50:53.712 --> 00:50:54.973]  There is a war.
[00:50:55.393 --> 00:50:56.394]  It's happening now.
[00:50:57.275 --> 00:50:59.076]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:50:59.636 --> 00:51:01.418]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:51:02.198 --> 00:51:03.679]  We are the resistance.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.341]  We are the Infowar.
[00:51:12.446 --> 00:51:15.388]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:51:17.125 --> 00:51:26.190]  We're here into the second hour right now and we're looking at some of the graphs that came out in March with CDC numbers out of New York.
[00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:33.894]  Heart disease, cancer, accidents, strokes, Alzheimer's, flu, homicide, etc.
[00:51:33.954 --> 00:51:39.637]  were all put in the COVID-19 column and they all reported zero.
[00:51:41.266 --> 00:51:46.989]  There were no heart attacks, cancer, car accidents, Alzheimer's, flu, murders.
[00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:59.414]  Because from mid-March through mid-April, they just took those numbers and put them there, mirroring the year before's numbers.
[00:51:59.434 --> 00:52:00.875]  And that's how these numbers worked.
[00:52:00.895 --> 00:52:02.976]  They're very close, year in, year out.
[00:52:03.836 --> 00:52:07.698]  But we didn't just want to go off of that.
[00:52:10.225 --> 00:52:14.287]  I hired a well-respected statistician here in Texas.
[00:52:15.067 --> 00:52:16.268]  There's an article dealing with it.
[00:52:16.768 --> 00:52:22.431]  Scandemic CDC stats show flu deaths dropped as COVID deaths increased.
[00:52:25.933 --> 00:52:30.635]  You can go through and see the methodology, see the numbers, and then you can click on those
[00:52:32.239 --> 00:52:37.701]  And go to the CDC and their own numbers that remember are also cooked inflating deaths.
[00:52:38.341 --> 00:52:41.922]  There's a lot of scams, but these are their own numbers proving their fraud.
[00:52:42.682 --> 00:52:44.222]  It's just even deeper than we can show you.
[00:52:45.543 --> 00:52:47.163]  Let's go ahead and go through some of these.
[00:52:47.483 --> 00:52:55.225]  Let's go to the new numbers from May and June and July and now going into August.
[00:52:56.066 --> 00:52:57.726]  Here's numbers for Arizona.
[00:52:59.767 --> 00:53:00.387]  And you can see
[00:53:02.483 --> 00:53:02.803]  How?
[00:53:04.726 --> 00:53:08.311]  They just say there's no longer any influenza deaths there.
[00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:11.455]  Nobody's dying of flu suddenly.
[00:53:12.015 --> 00:53:13.137]  They tell you, oh, we don't know why.
[00:53:13.197 --> 00:53:14.438]  Worldwide, nobody's dying of flu.
[00:53:14.759 --> 00:53:15.640]  Must be wearing the mask.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:15.920]  No.
[00:53:16.261 --> 00:53:17.202]  They just take the numbers.
[00:53:17.222 --> 00:53:18.464]  They don't count deaths as flu now.
[00:53:18.764 --> 00:53:20.566]  By the way, you read, they admit that's what they're doing.
[00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:25.592]  There's the numbers, there's the graphs, and they add it to the COVID-19.
[00:53:25.933 --> 00:53:29.094]  And notice how in graph after graph, as we go through U.S.
[00:53:29.114 --> 00:53:31.356]  states and even other countries, it's the same thing.
[00:53:32.196 --> 00:53:35.818]  They almost mirror each other because it's fraudulent, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:37.259 --> 00:53:46.225]  Now again, all of this is admitted that people that die of gunshot wounds are counted in skydiving accidents and cancer and the flu, but here it is state by state to see it.
[00:53:48.086 --> 00:53:58.593]  A side-by-side with influenza deaths in Arizona, pneumonia deaths in Arizona, COVID-19, multiple causes of death, Arizona.
[00:53:59.833 --> 00:54:04.676]  And you see how suddenly it all spikes when they flip that switch.
[00:54:05.637 --> 00:54:11.881]  And this really happened in May, because they decided to start counting 15 people for every person that had COVID.
[00:54:12.967 --> 00:54:17.911]  They were going to count 15 people, they surmised have it, and that's why you see the skyrocketing numbers.
[00:54:19.152 --> 00:54:23.395]  Here's California, just like the last graph you saw out of Arizona.
[00:54:23.855 --> 00:54:28.939]  Influenza deaths, suddenly, completely, end.
[00:54:32.542 --> 00:54:33.483]  As the year starts.
[00:54:35.424 --> 00:54:36.225]  And then what happens?
[00:54:36.285 --> 00:54:36.906]  COVID deaths.
[00:54:37.406 --> 00:54:39.568]  And look at that, it almost matches.
[00:54:40.572 --> 00:54:43.593]  Because they simply moved the numbers over.
[00:54:46.014 --> 00:54:47.435]  Skipping ahead a few graphs.
[00:54:47.495 --> 00:54:48.455]  Let's look at Florida.
[00:54:49.976 --> 00:54:52.817]  Flu and COVID in Florida.
[00:54:54.278 --> 00:55:04.322]  And look how the flu during this peak time during the year suddenly completely drops and COVID shoots straight up.
[00:55:06.563 --> 00:55:09.424]  And it's the same thing over
[00:55:11.294 --> 00:55:11.614]  And over.
[00:55:11.654 --> 00:55:12.474]  Let's look at Texas.
[00:55:12.514 --> 00:55:13.675]  Let's give a few graphs ahead.
[00:55:14.995 --> 00:55:21.217]  By the way, I was just sent more by the statistician around the world and around the U.S., and it's even more detailed than we thought.
[00:55:21.977 --> 00:55:22.897]  So we're drilling into it.
[00:55:22.937 --> 00:55:23.938]  It's a lot to absorb.
[00:55:24.498 --> 00:55:26.018]  I'm trying to get the statistician to come on air.
[00:55:27.359 --> 00:55:28.179]  We've used him before.
[00:55:28.219 --> 00:55:28.879]  He's well known.
[00:55:29.759 --> 00:55:31.860]  And he's gotten a lot of heat when he said who he was.
[00:55:32.998 --> 00:55:39.699]  So we're just, you know, you see how they fire all these doctors or take their YouTubes away when they speak out, because science is under attack.
[00:55:39.719 --> 00:55:40.959]  They say, trust the science.
[00:55:40.979 --> 00:55:42.700]  Well, here's CDC's own numbers.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.260]  And here's Texas.
[00:55:48.921 --> 00:55:50.221]  Underlying cause of death.
[00:55:50.881 --> 00:56:00.183]  No influenza deaths now, because you've got to take that mountain range of flu death, and you've now got to attribute it to that.
[00:56:01.786 --> 00:56:03.827]  The truth is they always exaggerate flu as well.
[00:56:04.488 --> 00:56:06.389]  Most of it's just really old people who die old age.
[00:56:06.409 --> 00:56:07.509]  Their heart gives out, whatever.
[00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:08.870]  They don't want to do an autopsy.
[00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:09.811]  They die in a nursing home.
[00:56:09.851 --> 00:56:11.212]  They die under the knife in a hospital.
[00:56:11.512 --> 00:56:13.473]  They just say, oh, they didn't die from the surgery.
[00:56:13.773 --> 00:56:15.094]  They didn't die from the anesthesia.
[00:56:16.995 --> 00:56:17.976]  They died from flu.
[00:56:19.326 --> 00:56:22.328]  So now we don't hear about the fake 30,000 deaths of flu in the U.S.
[00:56:22.408 --> 00:56:24.169]  It's probably really like 5,000 every year.
[00:56:25.009 --> 00:56:29.011]  Now it's attributed those fake deaths, those deaths from other things, to COVID.
[00:56:29.211 --> 00:56:31.913]  So they've been running this trick for a long time.
[00:56:32.213 --> 00:56:36.636]  Now let me tell you from my own personal experience looking at statistics, what's really going on here.
[00:56:38.196 --> 00:56:42.459]  I know most people in my family who've died have died of pneumonia.
[00:56:44.107 --> 00:56:47.508]  My grandmother died of a lung infection at 92, a few years ago.
[00:56:48.688 --> 00:56:52.169]  My other grandmother, from complications with her lungs.
[00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:57.171]  My great uncle, my uncle, my cousin, all in the last 10 years, all died.
[00:56:57.391 --> 00:57:00.351]  I can keep talking about friends and family that died of pneumonia.
[00:57:00.652 --> 00:57:09.114]  The truth is, every fall and winter, the hospitals are filled with people dying of lung problems.
[00:57:10.339 --> 00:57:15.243]  And because of Particula and the major studies, because of all these new viruses and things, pneumonia is getting worse.
[00:57:15.884 --> 00:57:17.645]  And the drugs aren't working.
[00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:19.287]  So, let me explain something.
[00:57:19.387 --> 00:57:21.388]  COVID-19 is real.
[00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:32.578]  And that there has been an underlying surge in new lung diseases and lung viruses across the world.
[00:57:34.175 --> 00:57:35.797]  The atmosphere has been manipulated.
[00:57:35.837 --> 00:57:36.978]  There is particulate in it.
[00:57:37.518 --> 00:57:44.585]  There are all these new viruses, and almost all of them, swine flu, bird flu, SARS, COVID-19, come out of China.
[00:57:45.065 --> 00:57:52.832]  That's because it's so dirty, so cramped, so debilitated, such bad nutrition, that just like a preschool, it's an incubator for disease.
[00:57:53.112 --> 00:57:57.016]  So there is major death from lung-borne diseases.
[00:57:57.316 --> 00:57:57.717]  My God!
[00:57:59.195 --> 00:58:00.936]  2019's the latest numbers we have.
[00:58:00.976 --> 00:58:03.178]  Look it up.
[00:58:03.198 --> 00:58:06.560]  1.4 million people.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:12.744]  1.4 million people died in the United States from tuberculosis.
[00:58:13.725 --> 00:58:14.805]  And the number's set to be even higher.
[00:58:16.106 --> 00:58:19.488]  Because it's drug-resistant, people can't get treatment, they're dying.
[00:58:19.728 --> 00:58:27.574]  And people are coming in across the border and aren't even being tested, and they're putting little kids in school with your kids, and not even treating the little kids that are sick, or your kids.
[00:58:28.459 --> 00:58:33.745]  They care if whether they were behind chain-link fences when they came in at a facility being checked.
[00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:36.489]  That's why they said, OK, we won't even check them for medical problems anymore.
[00:58:36.669 --> 00:58:37.590]  We don't want to be racist.
[00:58:38.931 --> 00:58:40.774]  You see, the globalists love disease.
[00:58:41.094 --> 00:58:42.215]  They love depopulation.
[00:58:42.981 --> 00:58:44.102]  And the numbers all show that.
[00:58:44.462 --> 00:58:48.065]  Influenza deaths, 12-week number, goes down to almost zero.
[00:58:48.345 --> 00:58:49.286]  COVID skyrockets.
[00:58:49.566 --> 00:58:53.910]  It's the same in every state, ladies and gentlemen, because they follow the United Nations edict.
[00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:58.093]  Then the CDC and NIH follow that, because the doctors don't want to get in trouble.
[00:58:58.393 --> 00:58:59.574]  It's false policy.
[00:58:59.674 --> 00:59:00.155]  It's fraud.
[00:59:01.869 --> 00:59:04.533]  Was either killed or committed suicide in jail.
[00:59:05.113 --> 00:59:05.954]  She's now in jail.
[00:59:06.135 --> 00:59:06.255]  Uh-huh.
[00:59:06.475 --> 00:59:07.276]  Yeah, I wish her well.
[00:59:07.336 --> 00:59:08.017]  I'd wish you well.
[00:59:08.057 --> 00:59:09.199]  I'd wish a lot of people well.
[00:59:09.719 --> 00:59:10.240]  Good luck.
[00:59:10.741 --> 00:59:12.403]  Let them prove somebody was guilty.
[00:59:12.423 --> 00:59:15.487]  I mean, do you know that she's... Oh, so you're saying you hope she doesn't die in jail.
[00:59:15.507 --> 00:59:16.589]  Is that what you mean by wish her well?
[00:59:16.909 --> 00:59:20.974]  Her boyfriend died in jail and people are still trying to figure out how did it happen?
[00:59:21.014 --> 00:59:21.975]  Was it suicide?
[00:59:22.035 --> 00:59:22.636]  Was he killed?
[00:59:23.336 --> 00:59:24.197]  And I do wish her well.
[00:59:24.217 --> 00:59:25.899]  I'm not looking for anything bad for her.
[00:59:25.999 --> 00:59:27.581]  I'm not looking bad for anybody.
[00:59:27.982 --> 00:59:31.526]  And they took that and made it such a big deal.
[00:59:32.046 --> 00:59:34.649]  But all it is is her boyfriend died.
[00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:36.511]  He died in jail.
[00:59:36.891 --> 00:59:37.592]  Was he killed?
[00:59:37.672 --> 00:59:38.533]  Was it suicide?
[00:59:38.993 --> 00:59:39.313]  I do.
[00:59:39.553 --> 00:59:40.234]  I wish her well.
[00:59:55.106 --> 00:59:55.646]  Bill Clinton.
[00:59:55.706 --> 00:59:56.026]  Nice guy.
[00:59:56.046 --> 00:59:58.807]  Got a lot of problems coming up in my opinion with the famous island.
[01:00:24.522 --> 01:00:25.102]  With Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:00:25.302 --> 01:00:26.143]  A lot of problems.
[01:00:27.363 --> 01:00:28.203]  So, there you go.
[01:00:28.243 --> 01:00:30.384]  They've made a big deal about him saying, oh, he wishes her well.
[01:00:30.504 --> 01:00:31.824]  Just like he wishes Yeezy Ping well.
[01:00:31.864 --> 01:00:34.225]  He doesn't want her to die in jail.
[01:00:34.305 --> 01:00:35.665]  And he's been very clear about that.
[01:00:35.705 --> 01:00:37.746]  There's no implication that Trump's connected to Epstein.
[01:00:38.226 --> 01:00:45.749]  But the media has pushed that continually while ignoring Bill Clinton on the flight manifest and all the witnesses.
[01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:53.491]  But shifting gears, and then we'll go to your phone calls, back into COVID-19, that whole fraud.
[01:00:55.387 --> 01:01:01.358]  Pharmacies are refusing to fill HCQ prescriptions now because Dr. Gates says you're not allowed to have it.
[01:01:01.378 --> 01:01:01.678]  Here it is.
[01:01:03.646 --> 01:01:10.350]  Hey everyone, I'm here at Morris Medical Center with my dad, Dr. Darryl R. Morris II, D.O.
[01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:16.813]  He has some things he would like to share and bring attention to in regards to how politics is affecting the medical world right now.
[01:01:17.053 --> 01:01:21.736]  Yesterday and the day before, there were many doctors who had a press conference in Washington, D.C.
[01:01:21.776 --> 01:01:24.878]  about their successful treatment of the virus.
[01:01:25.018 --> 01:01:28.260]  One particularly has treated over 300 patients in the Houston area.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:51.620]  With diabetes, hypertension, and COVID positive, and with massive success treating with hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and the protocol with Zithromax, which is having good success in many practices across the country, but physicians are being shouted down and the media is not carrying it because it's not the mantra of what turns out to be the left media.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.623]  It is clearly a hit on trying to get on the president here.
[01:01:55.447 --> 01:02:09.178]  And those videos showing those physicians who were having successful treatment with that protocol has now been deleted from Twitter and Facebook, which you all probably know are lean, left-leaning organizations.
[01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:15.062]  And that's just censorship and restricting the information flow in the United States.
[01:02:16.003 --> 01:02:20.467]  In our practice, I've written that same protocol for many of my patients that are at risk,
[01:02:21.247 --> 01:02:25.129]  And the local pharmacies have refused to fill my prescription.
[01:02:25.989 --> 01:02:30.311]  I've had many patients on hydroxychloroquine for many years because I also treat lupus.
[01:02:31.072 --> 01:02:35.834]  And for 20 plus years, they've been on that medication with no side effects, no trouble whatsoever.
[01:02:36.054 --> 01:02:39.136]  You guys saved my life and now you're dead.
[01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:43.878]  Dr. Anthony Fauci has said studies show the drug is ineffective at treating COVID.
[01:02:44.038 --> 01:02:47.540]  There's no reason to not utilize that protocol if it's indicated.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:56.542]  And not letting that information freely flow and refusing to utilize those protocols which are having success in other practices is just criminal.
[01:03:00.403 --> 01:03:02.103]  That clip enraged them.
[01:03:02.844 --> 01:03:16.887]  We learned that Mueller and the Clintons and all of them were involved suppressing information about themselves and how they were running these child molesting blackmail rings that was being managed
[01:03:18.871 --> 01:03:22.714]  By the Clinton Obama era FBI at the top.
[01:03:23.275 --> 01:03:29.140]  And we also in the documents learned that they tried to have the FBI implicate Donald John Trump.
[01:03:31.222 --> 01:03:35.226]  Because as we've told you years ago, he was a confidential informant.
[01:03:36.175 --> 01:03:42.780]  to the FBI in Palm Beach saying that the word is Epstein is engaged in criminal activity with underage girls.
[01:03:42.981 --> 01:03:44.642]  He was a fixture in Palm Beach.
[01:03:45.883 --> 01:03:47.965]  I had a falling out with him a long time ago.
[01:03:47.985 --> 01:03:49.926]  I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years.
[01:03:50.187 --> 01:04:00.255]  Epstein was actually banned from Mar-a-Lago according to court documents obtained by Inside Edition after Epstein was accused of sexually assaulting an underage girl at the club.
[01:04:00.635 --> 01:04:03.277]  Everybody knows Donald Trump doesn't like little girls.
[01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:06.678]  Donald Trump likes intimidating bombshell females.
[01:04:07.379 --> 01:04:11.281]  But these pedophiles, they want to suck the energy off these little girls, little boys.
[01:04:11.301 --> 01:04:13.362]  They want to be creepy.
[01:04:13.942 --> 01:04:15.503]  Weinstein's really gross.
[01:04:15.543 --> 01:04:20.366]  He likes to have underneath his girls, like, clean, reportedly, like, skin growths under his belly.
[01:04:20.426 --> 01:04:22.407]  And he has a vagina as well, reportedly.
[01:04:22.947 --> 01:04:25.289]  He's a hermaphrodite.
[01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:27.390]  I mean, can you imagine all of this?
[01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.211]  He, like, makes, like, 15-year-old girls.
[01:04:30.242 --> 01:04:34.244]  Is it true, sir, that you have what's been described as an egg-shaped penis?
[01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:59.432]  Epstein took my sexual innocence in front of a wall of framed photographs of him shaking hands and smiling with celebrities and political leaders.
[01:05:00.213 --> 01:05:01.914]  I was only 15 years old.
[01:05:01.934 --> 01:05:05.756]  You don't get in the globalist club unless you're really screwed up.
[01:05:06.477 --> 01:05:09.379]  They're fallen, they're diseased, they're inbred globalists.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.061]  And that's why they don't like those of us that aren't.
[01:05:12.401 --> 01:05:14.723]  And why they want to make us twisted and fallen and ugly like them.
[01:05:16.087 --> 01:05:18.008]  Yet the British Royalty all inbred as well.
[01:05:18.108 --> 01:05:24.291]  So it's all a bunch of inbred, hunchbacked demons who get all the power because they want the power.
[01:05:24.751 --> 01:05:25.812]  Because they don't have the power.
[01:05:26.332 --> 01:05:34.035]  Within hours of Jeffrey Epstein's apparent suicide, President Trump was retweeting a conspiracy theory linking Bill Clinton to his death.
[01:05:34.576 --> 01:05:37.877]  It was immediately picked up by Russian state media going viral.
[01:05:38.457 --> 01:05:42.019]  A Clinton spokesperson calling the tweet ridiculous and of course not true.
[01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:45.481]  Got a lot of problems coming up in my opinion with the famous island.
[01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:47.081]  With Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:05:47.242 --> 01:05:47.922]  A lot of problems.
[01:05:47.942 --> 01:05:49.462]  You think it was over the line?
[01:05:49.523 --> 01:05:51.703]  I don't know because I don't know her, but it was nasty.
[01:05:51.924 --> 01:05:55.025]  You raised the question of Jeffrey Epstein in your remarks in the Q&A.
[01:05:55.065 --> 01:05:56.285]  Yeah, I think he's got a problem.
[01:05:56.305 --> 01:05:57.766]  What do you think the problem will be?
[01:05:57.846 --> 01:06:00.727]  I don't know, but that island was really a cesspool.
[01:06:00.747 --> 01:06:01.748]  There's no question about it.
[01:06:01.788 --> 01:06:03.148]  Just ask Prince Andrew.
[01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:04.469]  He'll tell you about it.
[01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:06.830]  I really like how Trump's attacking now.
[01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:08.551]  Don't wait until October.
[01:06:09.711 --> 01:06:10.131]  Attack.
[01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:11.272]  Launch everything now.
[01:06:11.929 --> 01:06:17.614]  Maxwell is in prison, and so a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn in powerful people.
[01:06:17.814 --> 01:06:19.936]  Do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men?
[01:06:20.196 --> 01:06:21.317]  How do you see that working out?
[01:06:21.797 --> 01:06:22.278]  I don't know.
[01:06:22.298 --> 01:06:24.019]  I haven't really been following it too much.
[01:06:24.159 --> 01:06:25.100]  I just wish her well.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.322]  He said he wishes Ghislaine Maxwell well?
[01:06:27.702 --> 01:06:29.603]  You really don't want Trump wishing you well.
[01:06:31.005 --> 01:06:34.868]  When Trump starts wishing you well, you should get a little angel of death flapping above you.
[01:06:57.298 --> 01:07:04.021]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:06.402]  You better believe you got one!
[01:07:08.543 --> 01:07:13.625]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:30.592 --> 01:07:31.373]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:41.503]  You know, I decided to just go ahead and get rid of my regular radio microphone the rest of the week.
[01:07:41.523 --> 01:07:50.629]  I'm going to wear this wireless because I'm going to be getting up with charts and guests and I'm going to be standing on my head, figuratively, doing a lot of stuff here.
[01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.351]  Big article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:07:53.391 --> 01:07:55.172]  Here's why liberals are buying guns.
[01:07:55.332 --> 01:07:58.915]  Gun sales up nearly 135% in July, matching the nationwide average increase of crime, 135%.
[01:07:59.055 --> 01:07:59.755]  Funny how that works.
[01:07:59.795 --> 01:08:01.016]  And all the liberals I know.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:15.742]  That I know personally have come to me and apologized and said, look, I was an old fashioned Democrat because I bought into the propaganda.
[01:08:15.782 --> 01:08:16.582]  I know they're evil now.
[01:08:16.602 --> 01:08:21.003]  I know Republicans aren't perfect, but I understand that they're really, truly evil and bad.
[01:08:21.083 --> 01:08:25.904]  And I bought a gun and these are black people.
[01:08:25.964 --> 01:08:26.824]  These are white people.
[01:08:26.844 --> 01:08:28.004]  These are Hispanic folks.
[01:08:31.305 --> 01:08:31.985]  And they just get it.
[01:08:35.356 --> 01:08:36.116]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:08:36.396 --> 01:08:46.798]  They understand that Trump is a populist, and that this country is under attack, and that the people trying to take it over do not want to empower people, they want to enslave them.
[01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:52.439]  Now, I've been particularly wound up today, and I've been a jerk behind the scenes, so I apologize to the crew on air.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:59.161]  But I just got distracted today, because I'm just so ready for this show, so ready to cover all this.
[01:09:00.185 --> 01:09:03.627]  And then my son's up here, and Ted Anderson, and I'm trying to work with, again, a great guy.
[01:09:03.948 --> 01:09:07.190]  He's here, and there's all this stuff unfolding.
[01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:11.293]  I'm not complaining, it's just, I get why the average person just tunes out politics.
[01:09:12.594 --> 01:09:15.716]  Because you know it's corrupt, you know it's out of control, what are you going to do about it?
[01:09:16.136 --> 01:09:18.618]  And if you focus on it, it takes your life over.
[01:09:18.918 --> 01:09:23.882]  Like, let me tell you, I used to love football, basketball, baseball.
[01:09:24.262 --> 01:09:29.366]  My mom was a basketball fan, and football fan, but I grew up with her.
[01:09:30.418 --> 01:09:31.438]  What's the big TV person?
[01:09:31.458 --> 01:09:34.139]  But when the Celtics were on, man, she was in there watching.
[01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:38.060]  And I'd sit there while she, you know, she cooked dinner after dinner, whatever, you know, watching the Celtics.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.661]  My dad would be off reading a book.
[01:09:40.261 --> 01:09:43.902]  And, you know, Dallas Cowboys every Sunday around the TV with a party at the house.
[01:09:44.422 --> 01:09:48.163]  And I knew about the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Washington Redskins.
[01:09:48.623 --> 01:09:54.545]  And the, and the, I mean, I knew how much this football player weighed and what he ran the hundred in.
[01:09:54.605 --> 01:09:59.867]  And I, and the last time I got caught up in sports was when the Red Sox went to the World Series and I ended up
[01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:08.029]  Going down to a bar almost every night with one of my buddies, a few of my buddies, and eating food and drinking and having a great time.
[01:10:08.049 --> 01:10:13.913]  That was when I actually started drinking more heavily, was when the Red Sox won the World Series.
[01:10:13.933 --> 01:10:16.555]  Not even a huge Red Sox fan, just really good baseball.
[01:10:18.517 --> 01:10:25.162]  So I get why people don't want to tune into politics, because if you learn about it, then you get obsessed with it like sports.
[01:10:27.984 --> 01:10:30.186]  But then the people that got obsessed with sports
[01:10:33.001 --> 01:10:35.283]  Now it's become political so you can't even hide there.
[01:10:35.343 --> 01:10:36.003]  See how it works?
[01:10:39.025 --> 01:10:46.470]  With the take of the knee and the Black Lives Matter and the anti for crap and won't criticize China that's got millions in slave labor camps but America sucks.
[01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:51.533]  And so really, I get it.
[01:10:52.614 --> 01:11:02.541]  There's nothing I want more than to run to some little cabin in the woods and just say screw it, let somebody else deal with it, and go to town once a week.
[01:11:04.312 --> 01:11:06.553]  And just go for hikes with my dogs and my kids.
[01:11:07.794 --> 01:11:08.374]  But you know what?
[01:11:08.414 --> 01:11:11.376]  They're coming to your little cabin in the woods.
[01:11:12.056 --> 01:11:13.857]  They're not going to leave anybody alone.
[01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:16.558]  I think everybody's got that now, including me.
[01:11:16.658 --> 01:11:21.381]  And there's this sick feeling in me now that I'm going to have to do something.
[01:11:22.922 --> 01:11:24.983]  Because I've tried to do a lot with information.
[01:11:27.844 --> 01:11:33.267]  But the minute they come at you and say you can't have a driver's license or fly on a plane or have a job or go into a store,
[01:11:34.795 --> 01:11:43.120]  Unless you take this inoculation that they admit is deadly, and that is run by a guy that says he wants to depopulate, and he's not a doctor, he's not my doctor.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.762]  So I ask the listeners right now, I'm gonna take your calls.
[01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:54.487]  Bill Gates and the depopulation agenda he represents, what do we do about them?
[01:11:54.547 --> 01:12:02.172]  Because finally today, this morning, my psyche clicked into gear about maybe I can't fix this with information.
[01:12:03.547 --> 01:12:08.450]  And then the problem was, I'm not somebody trying to be big and mean and powerful.
[01:12:09.471 --> 01:12:10.332]  I'm trying to fix things.
[01:12:10.652 --> 01:12:20.579]  But when that gears finally clicked in to place, that gear is just saying, you want to kill me?
[01:12:20.599 --> 01:12:21.740]  Ain't gonna happen.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.141]  You're the one that's going to pay.
[01:12:26.107 --> 01:12:29.529]  And they know what they're doing, because they know they're losing, so they're pushing us into this position.
[01:12:30.089 --> 01:12:35.311]  We need to be like Jesus, and those that copied him, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
[01:12:35.691 --> 01:12:38.032]  We need to not be violent offensively at this point.
[01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:47.697]  But we better be active politically, spiritually, economically and culturally really aggressively right now, because we're under physical assault.
[01:12:48.917 --> 01:12:49.898]  And we're being oppressed.
[01:12:50.558 --> 01:12:52.339]  And we better start doing
[01:12:53.985 --> 01:12:54.926]  Civil disobedience.
[01:12:54.966 --> 01:12:58.249]  That don't mean burning down the police station or beating up innocent people.
[01:12:58.569 --> 01:13:01.371]  That means going into places without masks.
[01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:03.233]  That means going into parks they've closed.
[01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:06.155]  That means going to these globalist houses.
[01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:07.736]  That means filing lawsuits.
[01:13:07.776 --> 01:13:09.137]  That means get aggressive.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.841]  I apologize to the crew behind the scenes.
[01:13:13.861 --> 01:13:15.182]  I've been a little bit radioactive today.
[01:13:15.202 --> 01:13:18.365]  And it's because I am radioactive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:20.807 --> 01:13:21.868]  Every time I start sweating.
[01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:23.950]  Everybody knows.
[01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:24.971]  Well, that'll be a good rant.
[01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:33.176]  Jones is on today because it's literally my body starts counting down and starts making me like, think about this and think how I do this and how I do that.
[01:13:33.216 --> 01:13:34.997]  And it's just like war gaming at all.
[01:13:35.597 --> 01:13:38.779]  And it's scary, folks, but I know you're all doing the same thing.
[01:13:39.219 --> 01:13:43.722]  And we just really need to try to fix this as peacefully as possible.
[01:13:45.783 --> 01:13:46.564]  I have a plug today.
[01:13:46.584 --> 01:13:47.384]  I've been too upset.
[01:13:47.444 --> 01:13:48.265]  You believe what we're doing?
[01:13:49.265 --> 01:13:50.366]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:51.106]  Great products.
[01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:51.647]  Blow you away.
[01:13:52.957 --> 01:13:54.037]  Uh, let's go to the calls here.
[01:13:54.057 --> 01:14:00.019]  We got Michael, Alex, Brian, Don, Jacob, Joseph, Shannon, Duncan, Hoke, Shaleem.
[01:14:00.039 --> 01:14:01.199]  I always say his name wrong.
[01:14:01.259 --> 01:14:02.340]  I barely speak English.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:03.840]  We'll go to everybody.
[01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.541]  But what do we do when we're under assault?
[01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:14.963]  What do you do when they're coming physically for you and locking you down and carrying out, again, a dystopic nightmare on you?
[01:14:15.263 --> 01:14:16.264]  What do you do at that point?
[01:14:16.424 --> 01:14:20.485]  Because Bill Gates wants powerful physical control over your body.
[01:14:21.769 --> 01:14:27.854]  He wants that metaphysical control to not just rape you and physically, spiritually get power over you.
[01:14:28.094 --> 01:14:31.137]  He's got a vaccine that reprograms your very cells.
[01:14:31.437 --> 01:14:42.706]  He's gonna rape your ancestors and your very DNA and he's giggling and laughing about it and hiding it in plain view and having all this media he bought and paid for sit there and say that you deserve it.
[01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:47.029]  Which again is to gaslight you.
[01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:48.631]  What are you going to do?
[01:14:51.001 --> 01:14:53.021]  What do we do about Bill Gates trying to rape us?
[01:14:54.202 --> 01:14:55.582]  Bill Gates is a rapist!
[01:14:56.262 --> 01:14:57.843]  He wants to rape your DNA!
[01:14:59.423 --> 01:15:01.764]  Joseph in Ireland, you're on the air, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[01:15:02.744 --> 01:15:03.664]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:15:04.444 --> 01:15:05.264]  I'm pretty pissed.
[01:15:07.025 --> 01:15:19.208]  Um, Alex, I don't want to come in here as some negative, but a good general recognizes where they are, and I believe, and I've said this before to you, but this is the start of the
[01:15:20.151 --> 01:15:25.235]  The coming to power of the Antichrist next year will get really bad.
[01:15:27.176 --> 01:15:33.281]  Where I'm getting my information from, and I hope you don't mind me saying this, but God is talking to people in the world.
[01:15:33.301 --> 01:15:34.662]  Oh, it's happening, you're right.
[01:15:36.063 --> 01:15:42.748]  And Alex, you're actually word for word on some of the stuff he's saying, so you are being inspired.
[01:15:44.059 --> 01:15:49.643]  The Antichrist is a man, and I think you had a guy called Carlos on there a while back, and this is what finally made me ring in.
[01:15:50.063 --> 01:15:51.724]  He said the Antichrist is a human spirit.
[01:15:51.744 --> 01:15:53.365]  But the Antichrist is a man.
[01:15:53.405 --> 01:15:54.526]  He's going to reign over us.
[01:15:54.706 --> 01:15:58.268]  Adolf Hitler will be a teddy bear picnic compared to him.
[01:15:59.329 --> 01:16:02.571]  And Bill Gates is nothing but a minion bringing him in.
[01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:06.994]  I've looked at Kamala Harris, Pelosi and Hillary.
[01:16:07.715 --> 01:16:08.295]  I'm looking at them.
[01:16:08.315 --> 01:16:09.556]  There's a new Lisa Lyfe in them.
[01:16:09.756 --> 01:16:12.778]  They must have gone to some big satanic ritual and they're ready now to
[01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:17.552]  To move to the next level, and the real suppression is coming.
[01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:19.713]  Now, this is the appeal I have to make.
[01:16:20.414 --> 01:16:29.921]  All those who are listening, I think most of them are Christian, God-fearing people, but you can't say you believe in God and you're not praying, because this is the only thing that's going to bring an end to Alex's prayer.
[01:16:30.441 --> 01:16:37.506]  Joseph, I meant to open the show today with prayer and calling on God, because if we try to fix it ourselves, we get frustrated and enraged.
[01:16:37.546 --> 01:16:41.589]  What do you think I should do when I just feel so angry that I can't defeat this?
[01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:42.470]  I guess just give it to God?
[01:16:43.419 --> 01:16:44.700]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely Alex.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.581]  You know what?
[01:16:45.941 --> 01:16:49.564]  I mean, I'm coming from a Catholic point of view and I'm not here to ram anything down anybody's throat.
[01:16:49.864 --> 01:16:51.366]  Your own beliefs are your beliefs, right?
[01:16:51.866 --> 01:16:53.267]  But I would say to you, right?
[01:16:54.108 --> 01:16:58.472]  Offer up your frustration to God, to Christ himself, on the cross.
[01:16:58.892 --> 01:17:04.237]  Because it is he who is only going to conquer the Antichrist and bring his reign to an end through our prayers and our suffering.
[01:17:04.317 --> 01:17:05.458]  That's the reality of what's coming.
[01:17:05.478 --> 01:17:06.639]  Alright, powerful Joseph.
[01:17:06.679 --> 01:17:07.439]  Call back again.
[01:17:07.479 --> 01:17:08.280]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.481]  I'm going to shut up and take your calls.
[01:17:09.501 --> 01:17:10.542]  Stay with us.
[01:17:11.823 --> 01:17:13.724]  Look, the social contract's broken.
[01:17:13.744 --> 01:17:16.206]  There's an anti-human AI takeover happening.
[01:17:17.407 --> 01:17:23.350]  And whether you believe in the Bible, the Antichrist, Satan or not, they've used it as a blueprint of control.
[01:17:24.971 --> 01:17:31.896]  And I can't imagine being all the people that have attacked us over the years saying we were lying about this, and now it's out in the open.
[01:17:34.397 --> 01:17:37.598]  You know, I have... Again, I'm almost ashamed of it.
[01:17:37.638 --> 01:17:38.478]  I'm not bragging about it.
[01:17:38.498 --> 01:17:40.539]  Because with power comes corruption.
[01:17:40.939 --> 01:17:43.200]  But I know a lot of big producers in Hollywood.
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:44.220]  A lot of movie stars.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:50.502]  And I know people that have produced, you know, 50 major programs for HBO.
[01:17:50.562 --> 01:17:53.263]  I know people that have produced 30 major movies.
[01:17:53.303 --> 01:17:53.683]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:53.723 --> 01:17:56.064]  I mean, I know... And they're all like, where do I move?
[01:17:56.084 --> 01:17:56.624]  Where do I go?
[01:17:56.664 --> 01:17:57.405]  It's all collapsing.
[01:17:59.205 --> 01:18:01.046]  People go, oh look, Hollywood's collapsing.
[01:18:01.066 --> 01:18:01.506]  We're winning.
[01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:06.068]  It was always to destabilize us and control us.
[01:18:06.428 --> 01:18:08.889]  The globalists are making their move to kill the country.
[01:18:08.909 --> 01:18:11.310]  They're not going to invest in it anymore.
[01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:15.533]  The snake's already pulled its fangs out and slithered off.
[01:18:17.213 --> 01:18:17.834]  We're in trouble.
[01:18:17.934 --> 01:18:19.615]  And I don't say that to demoralize you.
[01:18:20.435 --> 01:18:23.437]  I say that so you get pissed and realize we're in the fight of our lives.
[01:18:24.977 --> 01:18:28.119]  I could talk to that last caller for an hour, but we had to get him off because I want to go to your other calls.
[01:18:28.139 --> 01:18:30.721]  I had to just leave Peterson to join us at 15 after.
[01:18:31.421 --> 01:18:35.644]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Pennsylvania.
[01:18:36.165 --> 01:18:38.006]  And I'm asking everybody, what do we do?
[01:18:38.086 --> 01:18:43.029]  What's our line in the sand when Dr. Gates, who isn't a doctor, says this vaccine hurts you?
[01:18:43.049 --> 01:18:44.770]  I have liability protection.
[01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:47.492]  We're going to make you take it to have a job or get on an airplane.
[01:18:50.894 --> 01:18:51.094]  Yep.
[01:18:51.535 --> 01:18:52.015]  Got me now.
[01:18:52.295 --> 01:18:52.616]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:52.636 --> 01:18:53.156]  Brian, go ahead.
[01:18:54.181 --> 01:18:54.921]  Good talking to you, sir.
[01:18:55.581 --> 01:18:57.542]  Previous caller was absolutely right.
[01:18:57.682 --> 01:18:58.482]  Prayer, number one.
[01:18:59.242 --> 01:19:03.303]  Number two, we're going to have to do the things that we aren't doing and just stand up.
[01:19:03.543 --> 01:19:03.943]  Get out there.
[01:19:03.963 --> 01:19:09.404]  We're going to have to get our own mob of just walking down the street saying, no, we're not taking the vaccine.
[01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:10.684]  We're not going to go through with it.
[01:19:11.464 --> 01:19:12.344]  And do our own marches.
[01:19:12.384 --> 01:19:13.044]  We're going to have to.
[01:19:14.044 --> 01:19:16.665]  It's tough because why aren't we doing it now?
[01:19:17.305 --> 01:19:22.886]  We've gotten so accustomed to that three weeks of vacation, air conditioning, 200 channels on our satellite dish.
[01:19:24.221 --> 01:19:26.502]  And we're just, we're not doing what we need to do.
[01:19:26.943 --> 01:19:31.685]  And hopefully, that'll be the time when we can, you know, finally come to grips and do it.
[01:19:31.965 --> 01:19:38.008]  Get out there, take our vacation days and use it as to go to D.C., get it marched together, whatever it takes, I don't know.
[01:19:38.028 --> 01:19:51.796]  But I've become increasingly concerned about the vaccine because working in healthcare these last couple years with the flu vaccine, slowly become where, yeah, you cannot take it, you can still work, no big deal.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.501]  Yeah, you cannot take it.
[01:19:53.541 --> 01:19:57.103]  Now you gotta wear a little tag when you get your flu vaccine.
[01:19:57.823 --> 01:19:58.824]  Oh, you don't take it this year.
[01:19:58.844 --> 01:20:00.965]  You gotta wear a mask if you don't take it.
[01:20:02.045 --> 01:20:06.068]  It's going to be where I'm not going to be allowed to work.
[01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.248]  I'm not going to be allowed to work.
[01:20:07.268 --> 01:20:07.669]  Well, that's it.
[01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:09.590]  They admit they're herding us into this.
[01:20:09.650 --> 01:20:11.451]  And again, I'm sitting there last night.
[01:20:11.471 --> 01:20:16.033]  I already knew about this, but my mom had her birthday, so she had some of her friends over to my house.
[01:20:16.073 --> 01:20:17.014]  My wife made dinner for them.
[01:20:17.794 --> 01:20:19.515]  And she was like, yeah, I can't go to Barton's screen.
[01:20:22.329 --> 01:20:25.331]  That's all them training you to go to a park?
[01:20:25.431 --> 01:20:28.113]  You've got to be enrolled medically with this tyranny?
[01:20:28.153 --> 01:20:28.653]  God bless you.
[01:20:28.693 --> 01:20:29.493]  I appreciate your call, Brian.
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.762]  Hoke Sheila in South Dakota refused to comply.
[01:20:42.922 --> 01:20:44.163]  Occupy fighting back.
[01:20:44.563 --> 01:20:45.004]  What do we do?
[01:20:45.044 --> 01:20:46.064]  How do we stand up to Gates?
[01:20:46.084 --> 01:20:47.305]  Because that's my question.
[01:20:47.345 --> 01:20:49.066]  He's coming assaulting us.
[01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:53.970]  He's a native American history with the smallpox blankets telling us he's a friend.
[01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:54.430]  What do we do?
[01:20:55.511 --> 01:20:56.391]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:58.873]  Yes, I got three points here.
[01:20:58.933 --> 01:21:02.295]  First one, as stated before when I called you many months ago for the first time.
[01:21:02.952 --> 01:21:08.194]  What the Grandfather Spirits, which I explained were angels, told us is that people need to get out on the street.
[01:21:08.574 --> 01:21:10.414]  It can even just be one person or a few.
[01:21:10.834 --> 01:21:12.115]  And they need to go to City Hall.
[01:21:12.135 --> 01:21:16.296]  You said we only have a few months to break this will or the lockdown will last forever.
[01:21:18.317 --> 01:21:21.098]  And so people have to get to the City Hall.
[01:21:21.218 --> 01:21:23.098]  They have to get to the Governor's Mansion.
[01:21:23.138 --> 01:21:26.399]  They have to get to the House of Representatives in their states.
[01:21:26.579 --> 01:21:28.300]  And they must occupy.
[01:21:29.116 --> 01:21:29.937]  No, I agree.
[01:21:29.957 --> 01:21:34.560]  Did you see how the New Mexico governor said liberals can protest, conservatives can't?
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.721]  She actually said that because that's because they fear that.
[01:21:36.781 --> 01:21:38.442]  We should ignore everything they're saying.
[01:21:39.303 --> 01:21:39.543]  Yes.
[01:21:40.023 --> 01:21:41.624]  Well, and here's the main point, though.
[01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:43.125]  People have to occupy.
[01:21:43.145 --> 01:21:45.547]  They have to hold ground and refuse to go.
[01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.008]  The next point.
[01:21:48.745 --> 01:21:52.167]  Now, I had an interesting thing happen here when I was on the phone with you waiting.
[01:21:52.627 --> 01:21:56.108]  I've had a lot of activist work going against me, particularly from Luciferians.
[01:21:56.628 --> 01:22:01.090]  Someone tapped into my line and started saying bizarre things to me as I was on hold.
[01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:02.331]  So I'm going to say it.
[01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:13.855]  What needs to happen is that anybody that has a video or the information that's on Anthony Weiner's laptop, they need to put it out on the internet, raw, and do it soon.
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:17.181]  Just like we saw with the George Floyd video.
[01:22:17.942 --> 01:22:24.126]  We need to see it absolutely put out because we know they have all that child murder on video, not just child rape.
[01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:25.747]  Exactly.
[01:22:26.467 --> 01:22:28.048]  And then the last point is this.
[01:22:28.849 --> 01:22:33.892]  One of the persons talked about prayer and that's true, but the other side of prayer is repentance.
[01:22:34.592 --> 01:22:40.616]  God is removing his hedge of protection around this country because people have not repented for the sins.
[01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:42.561]  One of those sins is abortion.
[01:22:43.061 --> 01:22:51.584]  The other sin, and I know this is going to be hard for some people to hear, but hundreds of treaties were made with Native American tribes in the name of God, and they were broken.
[01:22:52.444 --> 01:22:57.445]  And until we repent for these crimes, God will not return the hedge of protection.
[01:22:58.025 --> 01:22:59.026]  So these are the things I would share.
[01:22:59.046 --> 01:23:00.346]  Well, why do you think the Supreme Court did?
[01:23:00.386 --> 01:23:02.146]  I tried to figure out that ruling on Oklahoma.
[01:23:02.166 --> 01:23:02.746]  What's that about?
[01:23:04.247 --> 01:23:08.668]  I haven't really come to my understanding of why they did that.
[01:23:09.338 --> 01:23:18.505]  I think what they're trying to do within the system is they're trying to leverage the credibility of the indigenous plight to promote their own agenda.
[01:23:18.525 --> 01:23:20.347]  That's exactly, to create more division.
[01:23:20.367 --> 01:23:21.748]  They'll never actually get the land over.
[01:23:22.588 --> 01:23:22.848]  Yes.
[01:23:23.148 --> 01:23:23.929]  And I want to say this.
[01:23:24.029 --> 01:23:26.170]  Most Native Americans are pro-American.
[01:23:26.190 --> 01:23:26.830]  I understand.
[01:23:26.850 --> 01:23:31.112]  So the very few native speakers that you see out there screaming and yelling do not represent us.
[01:23:31.212 --> 01:23:32.652]  They're hijacking our identity.
[01:23:33.072 --> 01:23:36.294]  Hey, almost everybody out there that's Native American is totally dialed in and knows what's going on.
[01:23:36.334 --> 01:23:37.014]  God bless you, sir.
[01:23:37.034 --> 01:23:38.395]  I could talk to that guy all day.
[01:23:38.415 --> 01:23:39.455]  We gotta get to everybody else here.
[01:23:40.576 --> 01:23:44.257]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next here?
[01:23:45.538 --> 01:23:47.618]  Let's talk to Zach in New Hampshire.
[01:23:47.698 --> 01:23:48.299]  Go ahead, Zach.
[01:23:48.319 --> 01:23:48.759]  You're on the air.
[01:23:49.779 --> 01:23:50.059]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:50.079 --> 01:23:50.520]  Can you hear me?
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.120]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:52.574 --> 01:23:53.275]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[01:23:53.295 --> 01:23:54.055]  I got a few points.
[01:23:54.115 --> 01:23:55.417]  First one, I want to plug knockout.
[01:23:56.698 --> 01:24:03.664]  All the stuff that's going on is incredibly overwhelming and it's hard to sleep at night when you figure out what's going on for the first time.
[01:24:04.265 --> 01:24:07.668]  So knock out a couple of those pills and, you know, set it on auto delivery.
[01:24:07.688 --> 01:24:08.509]  It's what I got in here.
[01:24:08.989 --> 01:24:10.370]  Sleep like a baby and you're charged up.
[01:24:10.991 --> 01:24:13.273]  Anyways, not selling anymore.
[01:24:13.293 --> 01:24:14.154]  I just want to make a couple points.
[01:24:14.394 --> 01:24:15.535]  People wear your Trump gear.
[01:24:15.595 --> 01:24:16.556]  I know it's scary.
[01:24:16.656 --> 01:24:18.398]  I know it's scary to wear your InfoWars gear.
[01:24:18.874 --> 01:24:19.474]  But wear it.
[01:24:19.634 --> 01:24:24.777]  People have come up to me, they've given me their phone numbers, they have said, thank you for wearing this, thank you for not wearing a mask.
[01:24:25.218 --> 01:24:30.861]  Oh, when folks get one of our t-shirts, or a Trump t-shirt, I'm not lying when I say, you're signing on for an adventure.
[01:24:31.141 --> 01:24:35.803]  And most of it's positive, but after you shake ten hands, somebody drives by and tells you to go to hell.
[01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:37.684]  Just waiting for that one, Alex.
[01:24:37.764 --> 01:24:40.786]  I haven't had that happen to me yet, but I'm just waiting for it.
[01:24:41.006 --> 01:24:47.710]  And it's given me just a lot of faith that, you know, we're overwhelmed and we're censored, but it's just nice to see that the people are truly awake.
[01:24:48.446 --> 01:24:51.667]  The other point I wanted to make was about the schools and the schools not really opening up.
[01:24:51.707 --> 01:24:55.708]  At least here in New Hampshire, there's a lot of drama around that.
[01:24:55.728 --> 01:24:58.589]  73% of the people in our town wanted the schools to open up as normal.
[01:24:59.129 --> 01:25:01.530]  Now, I have a little inside information to the school system.
[01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:09.492]  I know that there are emails between the school board that said they are going to go against whatever Trump and Betsy DeVos decide to do.
[01:25:10.232 --> 01:25:13.793]  So, what we're going to do is we're actually going to file a Freedom of Information Act
[01:25:14.395 --> 01:25:19.158]  Against all of these emails and we're going to collect every email in New Hampshire from the school board.
[01:25:19.498 --> 01:25:21.360]  And show they didn't care about children.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:22.801]  They didn't care about education.
[01:25:22.821 --> 01:25:24.782]  They didn't care about the system we all invested in.
[01:25:25.202 --> 01:25:28.524]  They cared about political power to wage siege against America.
[01:25:29.565 --> 01:25:32.087]  But this is, I agree, and this is the message to normal people.
[01:25:32.587 --> 01:25:34.188]  Guys, don't be playing video games.
[01:25:34.268 --> 01:25:35.169]  Get off all the crap.
[01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:36.670]  Stop smoking dope and get to work.
[01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:38.331]  You are eventually going to have kids.
[01:25:38.351 --> 01:25:43.174]  The people that are listening to this that do not have families, you will eventually have a family and it will all click.
[01:25:43.615 --> 01:25:48.665]  You will realize your existence and your purpose, and it's for the future of your children.
[01:25:49.085 --> 01:25:50.225]  Now, the schools are a joke.
[01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.245]  McDonald's is essential.
[01:25:51.265 --> 01:25:52.746]  I can go to McDonald's and get a Big Mac.
[01:25:53.086 --> 01:26:01.107]  The grocery store that employs high school students can employ high school students, but these same students can't walk into the classroom in September.
[01:26:01.127 --> 01:26:01.827]  Well, exactly.
[01:26:01.867 --> 01:26:03.428]  Gates always wanted to get rid of the schools.
[01:26:03.468 --> 01:26:05.348]  The schools had problems, but we built them.
[01:26:05.648 --> 01:26:06.328]  We paid for them.
[01:26:06.568 --> 01:26:07.228]  They're assaults.
[01:26:07.288 --> 01:26:11.789]  The police have problems, but they're taking over all our institutions so the U.N.
[01:26:11.829 --> 01:26:12.189]  runs them.
[01:26:12.469 --> 01:26:12.689]  No.
[01:26:12.949 --> 01:26:16.930]  We take them back, and now we know they need to be American institutions again.
[01:26:18.203 --> 01:26:20.244]  Start filing the Freedom of Information request, people.
[01:26:20.364 --> 01:26:22.905]  They are terrified of us, and don't let them control your cities.
[01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:25.046]  You have to run for local office.
[01:26:25.427 --> 01:26:27.668]  Local town and city government... I agree, Zach.
[01:26:27.688 --> 01:26:28.328]  We're out of time.
[01:26:28.428 --> 01:26:35.852]  Alright, two more segments of calls, and I'm going to get to Michael, Alex, Don, Jacob, Shannon, Duncan, and Gator, and then we've got Jesse Lee Peterson on.
[01:26:37.233 --> 01:26:39.994]  And there's so much other huge breaking news, it's totally insane.
[01:26:40.634 --> 01:26:41.815]  But we're going to come through this together.
[01:26:41.875 --> 01:26:43.236]  If I don't plug, we won't be here.
[01:26:44.022 --> 01:26:44.903]  We have great products.
[01:26:45.384 --> 01:26:48.026]  We have the Reopen America Back to School Special.
[01:26:48.447 --> 01:26:51.230]  That is the last special we were running, but without the free shipping.
[01:26:52.091 --> 01:27:00.080]  Because we did the accounting and the math, and we just can't fund ourselves with 50% off and the free shipping.
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:03.003]  I mean, some of the products, like the Privacy Pocket, we were making like $2 on.
[01:27:05.316 --> 01:27:08.018]  So yeah, you sell 1,000 of them a day, you make $2,000.
[01:27:08.238 --> 01:27:10.801]  That doesn't pay for things.
[01:27:11.821 --> 01:27:16.265]  So you still get the Privacy Pocket at $19.95, but not with the free shipping.
[01:27:16.766 --> 01:27:22.931]  And all the supplements and all the rest of it, the discounts are there, but they're going to have to end because a bunch of these are close to selling out, so take advantage of that sale.
[01:27:24.428 --> 01:27:26.609]  I want to thank you all for funding us, because we don't get a big check.
[01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:30.612]  We don't get any check from any global organization, any big corporation, any group.
[01:27:31.052 --> 01:27:32.053]  We get money from you.
[01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:33.754]  InfoWars, you built this.
[01:27:33.774 --> 01:27:34.255]  You did this.
[01:27:34.655 --> 01:27:35.656]  So don't call and thank me.
[01:27:35.716 --> 01:27:36.416]  I want to thank you.
[01:27:36.436 --> 01:27:40.079]  All right, we're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:27:41.139 --> 01:27:43.301]  Let's go ahead and talk to Shannon in Texas.
[01:27:43.321 --> 01:27:44.762]  Shannon, thanks for holding.
[01:27:47.364 --> 01:27:47.604]  Buddy.
[01:27:48.624 --> 01:27:49.105]  Welcome, sir.
[01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:49.365]  Go ahead.
[01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:54.523]  Hey, I need a t-shirt that says, this honky ain't voting for no donkey.
[01:27:56.365 --> 01:27:56.525]  Okay.
[01:27:56.545 --> 01:27:59.186]  I think it would be awesome.
[01:27:59.487 --> 01:28:05.010]  But anyways, hey, listen, some of your guests are spot on with saying, you know, we need to turn to Christ.
[01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:11.054]  That's really the answer to all of our problems, to handling any solutions.
[01:28:11.635 --> 01:28:19.260]  As far as Bill Gates goes, I don't think we should have to worry what he will be able to do to us.
[01:28:20.017 --> 01:28:22.338]  Because we have the Holy Spirit to protect us.
[01:28:22.418 --> 01:28:26.800]  As long as we stay within the Holy Spirit, we have a hedge of protection around us.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:27.280]  Sure.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:35.923]  What about all the children born to dumb parents that they let them give all these deadly vaccines to and then don't wonder why they're totally mentally retarded or have cancer five years later?
[01:28:36.183 --> 01:28:38.244]  We have a job, though, to warn everybody else.
[01:28:38.624 --> 01:28:40.805]  And yes, this honky ain't voting for a donkey.
[01:28:40.825 --> 01:28:41.245]  That's funny.
[01:28:41.645 --> 01:28:42.906]  I just had really low audio.
[01:28:42.926 --> 01:28:43.646]  Couldn't really hear you.
[01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:44.326]  I could barely hear it.
[01:28:47.059 --> 01:28:48.519]  My issue is, you're awake.
[01:28:48.719 --> 01:28:52.701]  Don't let that, though, color your vision to think others are.
[01:28:52.741 --> 01:28:55.141]  We have a responsibility to warn other people.
[01:28:55.161 --> 01:28:55.761]  Does that make sense?
[01:28:56.882 --> 01:28:57.082]  Yes.
[01:28:57.502 --> 01:29:06.644]  But you are winning, because everywhere I go, people are talking about Pizzagate, people are talking about Adrenochrome, people are talking about the pedophile ring, in places that I've never heard people talk about that before.
[01:29:07.205 --> 01:29:08.705]  And what is that a bedrock to?
[01:29:10.029 --> 01:29:14.790]  The elite are maggots that are feeding on our children, our spirit, our future.
[01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:16.050]  Our children are us.
[01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:18.051]  They are attacking humanity.
[01:29:18.071 --> 01:29:18.631]  They're the enemy.
[01:29:18.651 --> 01:29:22.392]  So when I say, and I get what you're saying, hey don't worry about Bill Gates, people are waking up.
[01:29:22.432 --> 01:29:32.054]  I'm saying, if I was coming to your house with a shot that I said had an 80% chance of hurting you and I wanted to make you take it, you have a right to physically stop me.
[01:29:32.754 --> 01:29:37.337]  But he wants to pressure you saying, oh you can't have a job or get on an airplane or have a life if you don't.
[01:29:37.537 --> 01:29:38.537]  It's the same thing as rape.
[01:29:38.918 --> 01:29:42.660]  Telling a woman, I'm gonna fire you if you don't have sex with me.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:43.861]  That's rape.
[01:29:44.281 --> 01:29:46.222]  Whether you physically did it or used pressure to do it.
[01:29:46.502 --> 01:29:50.865]  Well he wants, it's not just raping a woman or a man, he wants to hurt you.
[01:29:51.265 --> 01:29:56.508]  What if the man told a woman, work for him, I'm gonna rape you or I'm gonna fire you.
[01:29:56.528 --> 01:29:57.909]  You wanna feed your children, don't you?
[01:29:58.269 --> 01:29:59.850]  And by the way, I've got hepatitis.
[01:30:03.117 --> 01:30:05.398]  I'm going to give you hepatitis if you want your job.
[01:30:05.938 --> 01:30:08.739]  Well, she has a right right then to stab him in the neck with a dagger.
[01:30:08.759 --> 01:30:12.500]  I mean, I tell my daughter, some man tries to rape you, kill him!
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:19.222]  I mean, seriously, I'm not, they're moving on us because they think we're pathetic and weak.
[01:30:19.482 --> 01:30:20.983]  They think we're going to take people's crap.
[01:30:21.283 --> 01:30:24.504]  And I'm just simply saying, I'm not somebody who shoots my mouth off about physical stuff.
[01:30:24.844 --> 01:30:31.366]  I'm just metaphysically moving into a zone where I'm having real trouble not just being open about that.
[01:30:31.406 --> 01:30:32.106]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:30:33.049 --> 01:30:36.713]  Yes, but we have the spirit and we can win this fight.
[01:30:37.273 --> 01:30:37.894]  I don't believe that.
[01:30:37.934 --> 01:30:40.977]  You said four years ago that we have five years.
[01:30:41.037 --> 01:30:41.958]  What did you mean by that?
[01:30:46.002 --> 01:30:53.050]  You know, I said one day at the end of a show that they're going to attack a rock concert or music concert tonight at 10 o'clock.
[01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.689]  Yes it does.
[01:31:21.866 --> 01:31:22.587]  And I think you're right.
[01:31:22.788 --> 01:31:24.511]  I think we're at the last year of it.
[01:31:25.052 --> 01:31:32.205]  And I think it's... If this is what God wants, and this is what we read in Revelations, then there's nothing we can do to stop that.
[01:31:32.225 --> 01:31:33.567]  The only thing we can do is turn to God.
[01:31:34.124 --> 01:31:38.567]  But I agree, our connection to God, called that psychic power, though, is going to turn up.
[01:31:38.647 --> 01:31:43.111]  Like, they think they've got surveillance on us, and they're going to cut our food off, and they're going to corner us.
[01:31:43.491 --> 01:31:48.555]  The more we get cornered, but don't give up on God, the more powerful we're going to get.
[01:31:48.915 --> 01:31:53.559]  Our spirits are going to get bigger and stronger, while their shadows are going to be taller than their souls.
[01:31:53.579 --> 01:31:54.660]  Understand me?
[01:31:56.241 --> 01:31:57.041]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:32:26.972 --> 01:32:29.413]  Alex, I would say no liability, no shot.
[01:32:29.794 --> 01:32:33.215]  If you believe in the shot, Mr. Gates, then you should accept liability for it.
[01:32:33.235 --> 01:32:37.457]  If it's going to help us more than hurt us, you should accept liability for the shot.
[01:32:37.858 --> 01:32:44.261]  I'd also get Dr. Francis Boyle to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Committee on COVID-19.
[01:32:44.621 --> 01:32:45.622]  Where did this come from?
[01:32:45.962 --> 01:32:51.965]  Whoever comes forward first tells us where this came from, and the true story can be granted amnesty.
[01:32:52.526 --> 01:33:02.033]  Those who don't will be punished accordingly, and those who die from the vaccine will be held to be the direct responsibility of the people that created the infection.
[01:33:02.053 --> 01:33:02.413]  Absolutely.
[01:33:02.473 --> 01:33:06.136]  You know, that's what my dad always tells friends and family when schools try to pressure them to take shots.
[01:33:06.196 --> 01:33:07.677]  It's not the law, but they lie and say it is.
[01:33:07.697 --> 01:33:08.557]  They say, hey, that's fine.
[01:33:08.818 --> 01:33:11.880]  I have a waiver form that you accept liability and any side effects.
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:12.560]  Guess what?
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:13.681]  They shut up real fast.
[01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:15.202]  It's all intimidation.
[01:33:15.502 --> 01:33:17.624]  They have bounties on how many kids get vaccinated.
[01:33:19.139 --> 01:33:19.720]  Absolutely.
[01:33:20.201 --> 01:33:29.553]  And I just think that if he truly put up or shut up, it's like in the movie, uh, Salem's Lot, where the vampire says, your faith against my faith.
[01:33:29.994 --> 01:33:35.582]  If you believe in this shot, Mr. Satan Gates, then you will accept financial liability.
[01:33:35.902 --> 01:33:40.544]  You're supposedly a philanthropist, but you're going to kill more people than you can afford?
[01:33:40.864 --> 01:33:42.165]  How is that philanthropy?
[01:33:42.205 --> 01:33:53.749]  By the way, that was a great made-for-TV movie, a kind of a ripoff of Nosferatu that was rewritten by Stephen King, but he actually has the human handler that takes care of him.
[01:33:54.069 --> 01:33:57.811]  He says to the priest, he goes, put down your cross, your will against my will.
[01:33:58.151 --> 01:33:58.891]  You're absolutely right.
[01:33:58.911 --> 01:34:00.492]  That's what we should say to them.
[01:34:00.512 --> 01:34:02.432]  Absolutely.
[01:34:02.492 --> 01:34:03.893]  I think you're doing such an amazing job.
[01:34:04.338 --> 01:34:05.979]  Wait, I thank God for you.
[01:34:05.999 --> 01:34:07.039]  I don't thank you, Alex.
[01:34:07.059 --> 01:34:13.383]  You've been given special gifts beyond anybody in America today, and I thank almighty God that you're here to wield them.
[01:34:14.019 --> 01:34:14.920]  And I appreciate you.
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.440]  It's you guys praying for me.
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:18.442]  It's the only reason, and I'm trying to hold it together.
[01:34:18.482 --> 01:34:20.463]  Believe me, it's not easy.
[01:34:21.283 --> 01:34:22.444]  Everybody sees so much now.
[01:34:22.504 --> 01:34:26.106]  I just see so much.
[01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:27.847]  It's hard to handle.
[01:34:27.867 --> 01:34:28.808]  I know you all see it too.
[01:34:28.828 --> 01:34:29.808]  They want to overwhelm you.
[01:34:30.068 --> 01:34:32.089]  We're learned helplessness, so we ball up and give up.
[01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:33.830]  I don't ball up and give up.
[01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:35.231]  I get angry, and that's not good either.
[01:34:35.251 --> 01:34:40.554]  So I pray to God every day to just give me the peace that King David talked about in that quiet place, the Most High.
[01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:41.435]  So God bless you, brother.
[01:34:41.835 --> 01:34:43.316]  Alright, let's go and take another call here.
[01:34:43.376 --> 01:34:44.477]  Who's been holding the longest now?
[01:34:45.457 --> 01:34:50.620]  That would be... Michael in Detroit, Michigan.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:51.040]  Go ahead.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.322]  Hi Alex.
[01:34:53.562 --> 01:34:55.663]  I want to say God bless you and everything that you do.
[01:34:56.023 --> 01:34:58.384]  Helping us keep the knowledge going.
[01:34:59.085 --> 01:35:00.686]  Well, we're all in it together now, brother.
[01:35:00.706 --> 01:35:04.048]  They're coming with forced injections and implantable microchips.
[01:35:05.468 --> 01:35:09.991]  Well, the first thing we need to do is we need to recognize that you're lighting a fire in us all.
[01:35:10.996 --> 01:35:19.521]  And we need to take the information that you give us, the information we get from your website, and keep CORE affiliated with your website, and we need to wake other people up.
[01:35:20.001 --> 01:35:30.988]  And then we need to get those people together, and we need to go to these city halls, we need to go to these governor's mansions, we need to let them know that we know what's going on, and we're not going to take it.
[01:35:31.773 --> 01:35:32.313]  No, I agree.
[01:35:32.353 --> 01:35:36.876]  You could be one person with a bullhorn at the governor's mansion, but Austin's two million people.
[01:35:37.436 --> 01:35:43.700]  If somebody every day, I've been down there four times, went down there and bullhorned him and said, stop serving the new world order and read off statistics.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:49.944]  If somebody bullhorned Trump every day to say, take action against the deep state, it's that voice that will change everything.
[01:35:52.305 --> 01:35:52.786]  That's true.
[01:35:52.926 --> 01:35:56.648]  And I want to thank you because you helped me turn and thanks to God.
[01:35:56.968 --> 01:36:00.090]  I turned my back on God for a long time and listening to you,
[01:36:00.879 --> 01:36:02.680]  I talk every day at noon.
[01:36:03.761 --> 01:36:04.762]  It's helped me wake up.
[01:36:04.842 --> 01:36:08.844]  It's helped me realize... And how much better is your life now turning towards God?
[01:36:10.325 --> 01:36:11.026]  It's a lot better.
[01:36:11.146 --> 01:36:12.967]  My relationships with people are a lot better.
[01:36:12.987 --> 01:36:14.768]  My outlook on life is a lot better.
[01:36:14.788 --> 01:36:17.290]  I don't have as much conflict in my life.
[01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:21.953]  It's really... It's eye-opening.
[01:36:21.993 --> 01:36:26.255]  It's almost kind of scary because you can feel the devil pulling your strings back sometimes.
[01:36:26.856 --> 01:36:28.377]  You've got to fight against it.
[01:36:29.551 --> 01:36:30.852]  Absolutely, that's real.
[01:36:30.932 --> 01:36:31.453]  God bless you.
[01:36:31.473 --> 01:36:31.973]  Thank you, sir.
[01:36:32.373 --> 01:36:33.614]  Alex in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:36:33.634 --> 01:36:34.155]  Thanks for holding.
[01:36:36.236 --> 01:36:37.137]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:36:37.177 --> 01:36:37.598]  How you doing?
[01:36:37.998 --> 01:36:38.378]  Good, brother.
[01:36:38.398 --> 01:36:38.738]  Go ahead.
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:46.124]  So, I've heard a lot of alluding to it from a lot of the previous callers, and you just mentioned it yourself.
[01:36:46.164 --> 01:36:48.046]  You've been to the governor's house four times.
[01:36:49.247 --> 01:36:51.829]  We know where Gafe lives, Medina, Washington.
[01:36:51.849 --> 01:36:53.811]  Fauci lives in Washington, D.C.
[01:36:54.411 --> 01:36:56.393]  You know, you were talking about the rules and engagement.
[01:36:56.433 --> 01:36:57.734]  How do we properly go against this?
[01:36:57.814 --> 01:36:59.135]  I'm just spitballing here, but
[01:36:59.727 --> 01:37:01.988]  You know, they move left, we move left.
[01:37:02.849 --> 01:37:04.029]  They move right, we move right.
[01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:09.032]  Why can't we go and storm and start bullhorning Mr. Gates' house?
[01:37:09.993 --> 01:37:12.374]  Folks took over CNN headquarters this weekend in LA.
[01:37:12.774 --> 01:37:13.635]  I don't want to be violent.
[01:37:13.655 --> 01:37:14.555]  I don't want to kill cops.
[01:37:14.615 --> 01:37:15.716]  I don't want to burn buildings down.
[01:37:16.276 --> 01:37:19.338]  But I'll tell you right now, I was up in Seattle a few years ago.
[01:37:19.378 --> 01:37:21.779]  My wife wanted to visit some family that lives up there.
[01:37:22.619 --> 01:37:24.921]  And we rented just a little sailboat.
[01:37:25.868 --> 01:37:26.168]  Rental.
[01:37:26.929 --> 01:37:29.711]  And the guy pulls up this little bay and he goes, there's Bill Gates' house.
[01:37:30.792 --> 01:37:34.935]  And we have to be there while Bill Gates' family doesn't have to be there.
[01:37:35.356 --> 01:37:38.898]  We didn't see Bill Gates, but I can recognize his 18-year-old son out there.
[01:37:39.619 --> 01:37:42.421]  I was like 100 yards from the dock and there was his son looking at us on the boat.
[01:37:43.182 --> 01:37:44.523]  And I rented the boat for the day.
[01:37:44.543 --> 01:37:45.203]  It wasn't that much.
[01:37:45.243 --> 01:37:48.346]  You rent the boat for like $1,000 and they make you a filet mignon or whatever.
[01:37:48.366 --> 01:37:49.327]  It was like four of us on the boat.
[01:37:49.867 --> 01:37:56.111]  But I mean, yeah, I'm not calling for violence, but we need to let him know that he wants to stick something in us.
[01:37:56.411 --> 01:37:57.591]  He says it's going to make us sick.
[01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:04.255]  Well, we're going to expose him for who he is and his agenda, and then we're going to let him know that we're watching his ass.
[01:38:05.576 --> 01:38:06.476]  Yeah, precisely.
[01:38:06.536 --> 01:38:13.120]  I mean, I've always believed that the next coming of Christ was going to be all of us embodying everything that he taught.
[01:38:13.570 --> 01:38:16.933]  And you know, the evil, the left, everybody involved with this, they like to use fear.
[01:38:17.113 --> 01:38:18.594]  That's the opposite of what Christ taught.
[01:38:18.935 --> 01:38:20.976]  Well, they also taught Christians never be offensive.
[01:38:21.037 --> 01:38:25.380]  And we don't kill people before they attack us, but it says, thou shalt not murder.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.721]  That means kill someone that's done nothing.
[01:38:26.741 --> 01:38:28.063]  It doesn't say, thou shalt not kill.
[01:38:28.403 --> 01:38:29.644]  It's a translation issue.
[01:38:29.664 --> 01:38:32.627]  The Old Testament says, enemies come to kill you, rise up and kill them.
[01:38:33.227 --> 01:38:40.673]  But you're absolutely right that Christ went into the money changers and he beat them with a whip and kicked them and beat their ass.
[01:38:41.314 --> 01:38:42.774]  And I'm not calling for that yet.
[01:38:43.155 --> 01:38:47.596]  I'm just saying, remember, Christ went in there into a temple with, you know, a hundred priests.
[01:38:48.076 --> 01:38:49.216]  They were unable to kick his ass.
[01:38:49.256 --> 01:38:50.377]  He beat their ass, didn't he?
[01:38:50.697 --> 01:38:53.837]  He gave people that little taste that, oh, I can do this too.
[01:38:53.877 --> 01:38:54.298]  You understand?
[01:38:55.558 --> 01:38:55.998]  Exactly.
[01:38:56.018 --> 01:38:57.458]  And he did it in the absence of fear.
[01:38:57.518 --> 01:38:58.859]  He knew he was doing the right thing.
[01:38:59.099 --> 01:38:59.839]  So we got their car.
[01:38:59.859 --> 01:39:00.439]  We got the number.
[01:39:00.459 --> 01:39:01.780]  I think we need to go straight to them.
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:03.760]  They want to go and protest our White House.
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:05.101]  We go and protest your mansion.
[01:39:05.581 --> 01:39:08.922]  You want to protest and try to take out our police department.
[01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:10.162]  We're going to be right there at your gate.
[01:39:10.808 --> 01:39:11.929]  Giving it right back to you.
[01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:13.590]  Whatever you do, we do.
[01:39:13.911 --> 01:39:15.532]  Rules of engagement, we're mirroring you.
[01:39:16.073 --> 01:39:19.496]  But there's no reason why, with everything that we know, we can't turn this around.
[01:39:19.536 --> 01:39:23.299]  Because the spark is coming that's going to light up all of us, all around the world.
[01:39:23.809 --> 01:39:26.752]  And we're going to just stand up, and we're going to embody Christ, and we're going to take over.
[01:39:27.233 --> 01:39:28.134]  Well, absolutely.
[01:39:28.555 --> 01:39:32.039]  You know, the Bible talks about it, and some of the New Agers try to steal the term, but it's real.
[01:39:32.359 --> 01:39:35.563]  It's Christ awareness, Christ spirit, Christ consciousness.
[01:39:35.963 --> 01:39:38.686]  And that means that Christ's spirit in us, that's what they fear.
[01:39:38.986 --> 01:39:40.068]  Notice they fear Christ.
[01:39:40.128 --> 01:39:40.849]  They fear Christ.
[01:39:41.129 --> 01:39:41.770]  This is the real deal.
[01:39:43.581 --> 01:39:43.861]  Sure is.
[01:39:43.901 --> 01:39:44.841]  All right.
[01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:45.642]  God bless you, brother.
[01:39:45.762 --> 01:39:45.982]  All right.
[01:39:46.642 --> 01:39:49.963]  I may have to host a little bit in the next hour, because we got Desi-Lee Peterson, a great guy.
[01:39:49.983 --> 01:39:51.044]  I'm so happy to have him coming on.
[01:39:51.544 --> 01:39:57.746]  And then we've got Gator, who I want to go to next, and then Duncan, and Steve, and Hal, and Pete, and Don, and Isaac.
[01:39:57.766 --> 01:39:58.687]  But I'll also tell you this.
[01:39:59.047 --> 01:40:00.447]  We're going to take a lot more calls on the show.
[01:40:00.927 --> 01:40:04.849]  And I'm going to do special shows, too, at night, where we just take calls, basically commercial-free.
[01:40:04.889 --> 01:40:07.490]  It'll be on radio and TV satellite for folks that want to pick it up.
[01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:10.191]  It'll be for everybody who wants to get it on the internet for free, as well.
[01:40:10.951 --> 01:40:11.932]  Let's take one more quick call.
[01:40:11.952 --> 01:40:12.913]  We only get about a minute and a half.
[01:40:13.533 --> 01:40:15.254]  Let's talk to Patty in Wyoming.
[01:40:15.314 --> 01:40:16.555]  Patty, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:40:16.575 --> 01:40:18.997]  Hey, Alex.
[01:40:19.397 --> 01:40:19.798]  Hi, Patty.
[01:40:21.899 --> 01:40:25.262]  Quickly, I got a little bit of noise, but can you hear me?
[01:40:25.782 --> 01:40:31.246]  Yeah, how it works with the phone system is when it puts you on air, it goes, pssh, and go ahead.
[01:40:31.266 --> 01:40:31.686]  Okay, great.
[01:40:31.767 --> 01:40:33.848]  So anyway, how are we going to fight it?
[01:40:33.868 --> 01:40:36.370]  We're going to fight it like patriots have fought it throughout history.
[01:40:36.832 --> 01:40:42.756]  All the way back to Biblical times, some of us will die, some of us will lose families, we'll lose property, but we'll prevail.
[01:40:43.317 --> 01:40:46.539]  We are seeing Biblical end-time prophecies come to pass.
[01:40:46.599 --> 01:40:47.619]  God's in control.
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.522]  He's calling out His army, and we will win.
[01:40:53.043 --> 01:40:54.084]  But you said the key.
[01:40:54.344 --> 01:40:57.826]  We've got to be ready to lose everything like Job and die if necessary.
[01:40:58.467 --> 01:40:59.067]  Who cares?
[01:40:59.328 --> 01:41:02.910]  You serve the Satan and take implantable chips of Satan?
[01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:04.171]  That's worse than death.
[01:41:05.451 --> 01:41:10.115]  If you dial in your number, it'll be perfect.
[01:41:13.137 --> 01:41:14.277]  Patty, your phone's breaking up.
[01:41:14.518 --> 01:41:15.478]  I said this yesterday.
[01:41:16.519 --> 01:41:17.980]  We need to get all the callers' numbers.
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:21.162]  And actually, for the first time ever, it's my fault I never reminded the crew to do it.
[01:41:21.502 --> 01:41:23.604]  I should call them at the start of the show and get them on.
[01:41:24.625 --> 01:41:25.645]  Patty's phone's breaking up.
[01:41:26.146 --> 01:41:27.347]  What she was saying was powerful.
[01:41:28.274 --> 01:41:28.615]  Who knows?
[01:41:28.675 --> 01:41:34.323]  We'll get Jesse Lee Peterson on, and I'll probably go to your calls after that, but I don't want to shortchange you, and I don't want to lead you the wrong way.
[01:41:34.343 --> 01:41:37.748]  I'm not sure how much time we have, but Jesse Lee Peterson's coming up.
[01:41:37.808 --> 01:41:39.571]  I mean, look, the Mark of the Beast world government's here.
[01:41:39.591 --> 01:41:40.292]  What are we going to do about it?
[01:41:45.037 --> 01:41:46.358]  Good morning, everybody.
[01:41:46.378 --> 01:42:01.826]  This is Dr. Lisa Koch coming to you live from Tampa, Florida, where I continue to lead a large 8,000 patient practice through the front lines of this COVID-19 pandemic.
[01:42:02.187 --> 01:42:08.030]  I'm going to try to make it through this live without getting too upset, but yesterday my colleagues
[01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:17.473]  We're on Capitol Hill and these people, I felt the connection so deeply because they are people who love and care for patients just like I do.
[01:42:18.113 --> 01:42:22.594]  And they came out and they spoke about information that has been hidden from the public.
[01:42:23.274 --> 01:42:25.775]  Information that I've had to go underground to find.
[01:42:25.795 --> 01:42:27.736]  I'm not a political person.
[01:42:27.756 --> 01:42:29.136]  I just want to heal people.
[01:42:29.156 --> 01:42:31.657]  I want to empower people.
[01:42:31.677 --> 01:42:37.719]  I want you to be able to take care of yourselves and live a life the highest potential you ever can possibly achieve.
[01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:40.440]  And that requires you being able to feel good.
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:43.481]  It requires you being able to ask questions.
[01:42:44.401 --> 01:42:46.142]  And these doctors have information.
[01:42:46.702 --> 01:42:49.223]  Why are these doctors being censored on YouTube?
[01:42:49.323 --> 01:42:50.583]  Who is doing that?
[01:42:51.724 --> 01:42:52.044]  Why?
[01:42:52.144 --> 01:42:53.264]  What is their agenda?
[01:42:53.785 --> 01:42:55.725]  Why do we have to see more people die?
[01:42:56.586 --> 01:42:59.787]  If you saw that woman with her heart on her sleeve,
[01:43:01.269 --> 01:43:06.856]  She was begging the American people saying she didn't care what happened to her, that the information has to be released.
[01:43:07.136 --> 01:43:12.342]  I tell all of you doctors that are sitting down and watching Americans die, you're like...
[01:43:13.499 --> 01:43:18.461]  The good Nazi, the good one, the good Germans that watch Jews get killed and you do not speak up.
[01:43:18.681 --> 01:43:19.801]  I believe I'm one of them.
[01:43:20.341 --> 01:43:25.383]  If they come after me, they threaten me, they threaten to, I mean, I've gotten all kinds of threats.
[01:43:25.743 --> 01:43:26.943]  Oh, they're going to report me to the bots.
[01:43:27.424 --> 01:43:28.324]  They're going to, I say, you know what?
[01:43:28.404 --> 01:43:28.984]  I don't care.
[01:43:29.224 --> 01:43:30.344]  I'm not going to let Americans die.
[01:43:30.845 --> 01:43:35.786]  And if this is the mountain, if this is the hill where I get nailed on, I will get nailed on it.
[01:43:36.026 --> 01:43:36.546]  I don't care.
[01:43:36.947 --> 01:43:38.007]  You can report me to the bots.
[01:43:38.287 --> 01:43:38.967]  You can kill me.
[01:43:39.127 --> 01:43:41.048]  You can do whatever, but I'm not going to let Americans die.
[01:43:41.368 --> 01:43:42.329]  That clip enraged them.
[01:44:00.754 --> 01:44:22.804]  And that predominantly, the biggest point that was given on this during this newscast or press conference was that hydroxychloroquine, which has been all over the place during this pandemic, as soon as it started gaining momentum, whether it was political reasons or because of the V word and funding of a study that was
[01:44:23.704 --> 01:44:26.206]  Shady, and I've discussed this on the slide before.
[01:44:26.847 --> 01:44:27.908]  They confirmed that.
[01:44:28.288 --> 01:44:32.772]  Those studies, and some of which were retracted from major journals.
[01:44:32.852 --> 01:44:35.234]  Who is allowing that to be published in the first place?
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:42.444]  Using hydroxychloroquine at four times the dose and then being able to say that it caused cardiac arrhythmias.
[01:44:42.544 --> 01:44:47.428]  Dr. Anthony Fauci has said studies show the drug is ineffective at treating COVID.
[01:44:47.608 --> 01:45:00.557]  And now they're going in and pulling out peer-reviewed studies going back years ago about hydroxychloroquine and they are taking it down because they are so upset that this is challenging them because they want you to take a forced inoculation.
[01:45:00.617 --> 01:45:05.360]  So what the problem is in a lot of those studies, they did very, very high doses, massive doses,
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:06.421]  There's a preventive dose.
[01:45:06.501 --> 01:45:07.641]  It's incredibly low.
[01:45:07.822 --> 01:45:11.184]  It's a 200 milligram tablet of this pill twice a week.
[01:45:11.824 --> 01:45:12.485]  There's no risk.
[01:45:12.545 --> 01:45:13.285]  They've done studies.
[01:45:13.325 --> 01:45:15.727]  This drug has been out for 65 years.
[01:45:16.387 --> 01:45:19.689]  So why are we not giving that to our frontline workers?
[01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:21.711]  Why are we not giving that to our teachers?
[01:45:22.151 --> 01:45:24.533]  Why are we not giving that to the immunocompromised?
[01:45:24.593 --> 01:45:32.658]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation, that we can manage the virus.
[01:45:32.718 --> 01:45:33.379]  You can kill me.
[01:45:33.559 --> 01:45:35.480]  You can do whatever, but I'm not going to let Americans die.
[01:45:43.925 --> 01:45:52.011]  Well, he's been on with us years ago and he's a frequent guest with Owen Schroer and he's always been popular since I knew about him, again, more than 20 years ago, but he's really...
[01:45:52.884 --> 01:45:56.707]  White hot right now with billions of views on YouTube and other places.
[01:45:56.807 --> 01:45:59.709]  Jesse Lee Peterson, rebuildingtheman.com.
[01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:02.071]  And people don't know who Jesse Lee Peterson is.
[01:46:02.091 --> 01:46:06.915]  They've been hiding under a rock, but he's the most courageous outspoken critic of the civil rights establishment in America today.
[01:46:07.496 --> 01:46:10.498]  Raised without a father on a plantation near Tuskegee, Alabama.
[01:46:10.898 --> 01:46:15.442]  During the Jim Crow era, Peterson has lived a part of American history few have experienced.
[01:46:16.343 --> 01:46:16.723]  We're good to go.
[01:46:38.326 --> 01:46:39.427]  Start businesses.
[01:46:39.807 --> 01:46:41.928]  Peterson is also a radio and TV personality.
[01:46:42.208 --> 01:46:44.169]  Talk shows, I'm not going to go over it all, he's been everywhere.
[01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:48.872]  Twitter, JLP Talk, JesseLeePeterson.com or BuildingTheMan.com.
[01:46:49.132 --> 01:46:56.656]  We've had more technical difficulties today than we've had in the last six months, so I apologize for getting him on late, but he's at least here with us for the next two and a half segments.
[01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:58.217]  Thank you so much, sir, for being with us.
[01:46:58.477 --> 01:47:01.378]  You've got a lot to cover today, and just God bless you.
[01:47:01.398 --> 01:47:02.379]  What do you want to cover first?
[01:47:03.507 --> 01:47:06.229]  Well, number one, I want to say thank you for having me on.
[01:47:06.389 --> 01:47:07.870]  And happy Men's History Month.
[01:47:08.411 --> 01:47:10.252]  August is Men's History Month.
[01:47:10.272 --> 01:47:14.896]  This is our third year of celebrating it because men
[01:47:15.939 --> 01:47:19.622]  Men and boys are the most hated species on this side of heaven.
[01:47:20.022 --> 01:47:27.388]  So we're bringing the attention to that so that men can wake up and take back control, become back to their natural state of being.
[01:47:27.788 --> 01:47:30.851]  So we have been rebuilding a family by rebuilding a man for the last 30 years.
[01:47:30.871 --> 01:47:33.573]  I should have said that you're really great at launching big movements.
[01:47:34.053 --> 01:47:36.776]  And you pointed out this attack on men many, many decades ago.
[01:47:36.816 --> 01:47:37.696]  Now it's out in the open.
[01:47:38.057 --> 01:47:39.218]  You've talked about, hey, let's have
[01:47:40.371 --> 01:47:44.072]  Let's have White History Month too, and let's have Man History Month, and let's have Women History Month.
[01:47:44.312 --> 01:47:47.973]  Let's actually celebrate the roles we all have instead of something Soros runs.
[01:47:48.894 --> 01:47:49.414]  That's right.
[01:47:50.074 --> 01:47:58.917]  And July was White History Month, and the reason we started that three years ago, because white people are the most hated species on this side of heaven.
[01:47:59.317 --> 01:48:04.038]  And we see that now with the attack upon the President Donald Trump.
[01:48:04.238 --> 01:48:05.599]  I call him the Great White Hope.
[01:48:06.439 --> 01:48:09.420]  We see that with the attack upon white Americans today.
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:12.641]  They're being knocked out, robbed, raped, murdered.
[01:48:13.061 --> 01:48:16.122]  Their businesses are being destroyed and no one cares.
[01:48:16.563 --> 01:48:18.183]  No one says anything about it.
[01:48:18.523 --> 01:48:25.466]  So we gotta remind people of white history because if it wasn't for white people, there would be no America.
[01:48:25.926 --> 01:48:31.428]  It was white folks who founded and created the greatest country on this side of heaven.
[01:48:31.848 --> 01:48:32.588]  Not blacks.
[01:48:32.968 --> 01:48:37.909]  Not Mexicans, not Japanese, not Chinese, not Filipino, but white people.
[01:48:38.309 --> 01:48:45.391]  And we cannot afford, Alex, to let them erase white American history and create a false history.
[01:48:45.431 --> 01:48:46.591]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:48:46.972 --> 01:48:52.473]  So we celebrate White History Month in July to remind the people how great this country is and who founded it.
[01:48:53.234 --> 01:49:04.953]  Well, you're doing really bold stuff, because the idea of the Christian Renaissance is to empower everybody, and that's why the globalists want to get rid of it, because the real lot of England banning slavery around the world, they're really threatened by that.
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:06.941]  Absolutely.
[01:49:07.541 --> 01:49:11.885]  And in America, I have to say that if we don't stand up, we're going to have it here.
[01:49:11.925 --> 01:49:12.806]  It's going to get worse.
[01:49:13.186 --> 01:49:14.827]  Look what happened in South Africa.
[01:49:15.448 --> 01:49:17.470]  White people are now under attack.
[01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:19.371]  They're being robbed, raped, and murdered.
[01:49:19.411 --> 01:49:26.597]  They're not even protected by the police force because they have redone the police forces over in Africa, South Africa.
[01:49:27.078 --> 01:49:28.919]  And now white people don't have a chance.
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:31.682]  They're doing the exact same thing here.
[01:49:32.262 --> 01:49:35.867]  White people are afraid to speak up for fear of being called racist.
[01:49:36.267 --> 01:49:40.913]  We have these radical black women and some men who are weak beta males.
[01:49:41.334 --> 01:49:46.280]  We have them in the power of men, police chiefs and... Stay right there, Jesse.
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:46.961]  You're on fire.
[01:49:47.001 --> 01:49:47.342]  We'll be back.
[01:49:47.742 --> 01:49:51.663]  All right, we got him on late because I had microphone problems today, more than I've had in six months.
[01:49:51.683 --> 01:49:52.403]  We never had problems.
[01:49:52.423 --> 01:49:53.543]  A bunch of crazy stuff happened.
[01:49:53.824 --> 01:49:55.184]  But they say when it rains, it pours.
[01:49:55.204 --> 01:50:00.345]  So he'll be with us 15 minutes to the next hour to get that full time with Jesse Lee Peterson, which is always so precious.
[01:50:00.365 --> 01:50:03.046]  Then Paul Joseph Watson will take over from the United Kingdom.
[01:50:03.066 --> 01:50:04.486]  But here he is with us.
[01:50:04.566 --> 01:50:04.906]  Love him.
[01:50:05.366 --> 01:50:09.548]  I remember watching him 25 years ago when I first was seeing his show here in Austin on TV.
[01:50:09.588 --> 01:50:10.748]  And of course, now he's on radio.
[01:50:11.548 --> 01:50:15.050]  And he made a lot of sense when he's like, men are under attack, families under attack.
[01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:17.272]  But now you see how right he was.
[01:50:17.732 --> 01:50:23.856]  And so I get so excited to see how incredibly successful he is today, rebuilding theman.com.
[01:50:24.296 --> 01:50:26.838]  That's what unifies us is our families are under attack.
[01:50:27.745 --> 01:50:31.887]  Black Lives Matter, run by Planned Parenthood and Jordan Soros, says, in the nuclear family.
[01:50:31.907 --> 01:50:33.228]  Well, that hurts all of us.
[01:50:33.268 --> 01:50:34.329]  You couldn't do something worse.
[01:50:34.929 --> 01:50:38.972]  And I see a huge awakening by black Americans, particularly, to this whole thing.
[01:50:39.032 --> 01:50:41.033]  But you're the expert on what's happening right now.
[01:50:41.313 --> 01:50:47.897]  So you have the floor, my friend, in the next few segments to get into whatever you want to cover and what you want to talk about on this planet that's unfolding.
[01:50:48.197 --> 01:50:54.001]  Democrats attempt to take down the president, BLM, Antifa, the antidote to all the chaos in the inner cities.
[01:50:54.301 --> 01:50:56.082]  Jesse Lee Peterson, my friend, you've got the floor.
[01:50:57.076 --> 01:50:57.676]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:50:57.737 --> 01:50:58.917]  I appreciate it, man.
[01:50:58.957 --> 01:50:59.358]  Thank you.
[01:51:00.178 --> 01:51:06.023]  I do want to say that I'm stunned at what I see happening with this so-called Black Lives Matter.
[01:51:06.463 --> 01:51:18.873]  You got to realize that Black Lives Matter is a far-left, liberal, radical organization that was founded by fat, black, angry, radical lesbians.
[01:51:19.553 --> 01:51:25.198]  And I just never imagined that one day in a Christian nation,
[01:51:25.825 --> 01:51:34.209]  That we would see police officers, grown men and women, bowing down to a bunch of fat black lesbians.
[01:51:34.590 --> 01:51:35.910]  That's mind-blowing to see.
[01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:37.171]  These people hate God.
[01:51:37.191 --> 01:51:38.692]  They hate the family.
[01:51:39.112 --> 01:51:40.453]  They hate the nuclear family.
[01:51:40.633 --> 01:51:42.174]  They hate the unborn children.
[01:51:42.634 --> 01:51:43.714]  They hate white people.
[01:51:43.894 --> 01:51:44.875]  They hate America.
[01:51:45.255 --> 01:51:48.497]  They're going around taking down statues and monuments and
[01:51:48.977 --> 01:51:49.857]  We're good.
[01:52:06.543 --> 01:52:11.227]  Who have been in jail before, who have not been raised by good parents.
[01:52:11.607 --> 01:52:20.293]  The cops are not going around and brutalizing decent black people because decent black people follow instructions when they're stopped by the cops.
[01:52:20.753 --> 01:52:23.556]  And I can't believe that America is falling for this.
[01:52:24.056 --> 01:52:28.859]  We got to realize that these people want to turn America into a socialist society.
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.921]  And that's what these radical black
[01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:33.692]  So-called Black Lives Matter people are doing.
[01:52:34.492 --> 01:52:37.093]  The words Black Lives Matter have no meaning.
[01:52:37.673 --> 01:52:40.834]  They're there to manipulate and control and intimidate.
[01:52:41.254 --> 01:52:43.834]  And I'm surprised to see white Americans falling for it.
[01:52:44.335 --> 01:52:46.935]  I knew that white Americans had a problem with speaking up.
[01:52:47.395 --> 01:52:48.796]  And I've been telling them for 30 years.
[01:52:49.856 --> 01:52:58.347]  Black people are suffering not because of Jim Crow, not because of slavery, not because of this phony idea of systemic racism.
[01:52:58.767 --> 01:53:04.334]  Black Americans are suffering, those who are suffering, are suffering due to the destruction of their parents.
[01:53:04.374 --> 01:53:05.516]  They had no good parents.
[01:53:06.036 --> 01:53:10.561]  And the father's not around, and they have been blamed.
[01:53:10.601 --> 01:53:12.363]  They are blaming white people for it.
[01:53:12.743 --> 01:53:18.909]  Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrakhan, Al Sharpton, and all those people started this whole civil rights movement.
[01:53:19.269 --> 01:53:26.797]  They started that crap 40 to 50 years ago, and it's just gotten worse because they're not trying to rebuild the family.
[01:53:26.817 --> 01:53:29.720]  They're not encouraging blacks to love all people.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:31.521]  I grew up in Alabama.
[01:53:31.821 --> 01:53:34.382]  As you know, Alex, I grew up under the Jericho laws.
[01:53:34.842 --> 01:53:35.963]  I grew up under the laws.
[01:53:36.063 --> 01:53:38.504]  I remember for colors only sign, for whites only.
[01:53:38.884 --> 01:53:40.565]  But we were not taught to hate.
[01:53:41.184 --> 01:53:45.066]  We were told that it's a battle between good and evil, right versus wrong.
[01:53:45.427 --> 01:53:49.849]  There are people who are on the side of Satan, and there are those who are on the side of God.
[01:53:50.309 --> 01:53:55.392]  And, you know, all color, all races, and that we should treat people the way we would like to be treated.
[01:53:55.753 --> 01:53:58.614]  I didn't hear all this crap about racism and all that.
[01:53:59.135 --> 01:54:04.818]  That didn't start until the so-called civil rights movement started, which should have never happened.
[01:54:05.278 --> 01:54:08.020]  It was an awful mistake to have a civil rights movement.
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:09.681]  Let's not say civil rights.
[01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:22.718]  And those people in the so-called Civil Rights Movement, they sold blacks over to the Democratic Party, they sold them over to the government, and they set themselves up as being leaders of black people.
[01:54:23.159 --> 01:54:27.802]  And black people have gotten worse instead of getting better because they're not led by what is right.
[01:54:27.822 --> 01:54:38.489]  And let's be clear, Christians had the abolition, Christians tried to fix the wrongs, and the Democrats who were running the slavery, they just stepped in and took it over and created a new form of slavery right after it.
[01:54:39.437 --> 01:54:40.017]  That's right.
[01:54:40.177 --> 01:54:44.518]  Because when I was growing up, most black people, all that I knew were Republicans.
[01:54:44.558 --> 01:54:45.759]  They were not Democrats.
[01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:49.099]  And the Jim Crow law was established by the Democratic Party.
[01:54:49.139 --> 01:54:49.920]  We knew that.
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.100]  And so, we were Republicans.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:54.141]  And we were individual thinking.
[01:54:54.501 --> 01:55:00.942]  And so they sold us over to the Democratic Party, and blacks have been subject to that party ever since.
[01:55:01.202 --> 01:55:02.203]  How did that transfer happen?
[01:55:02.263 --> 01:55:03.463]  Is that when Reinforcement came back?
[01:55:04.103 --> 01:55:11.248]  My grandfather came back from World War II, B-17 pilot, and it was a big deal in the family, not because they were racist, but because everybody was Democrats in Texas.
[01:55:11.609 --> 01:55:14.631]  He said, I believe in racial equality, and I believe in all this.
[01:55:14.911 --> 01:55:15.611]  I'm going to be a Republican.
[01:55:15.631 --> 01:55:19.594]  He ran for office, won local office, and then later everybody went Republican, but that was under Eisenhower.
[01:55:19.634 --> 01:55:26.279]  But how did the switch happen where suddenly the party of Lincoln is the KKK, and the party of the KKK is the party of Lincoln?
[01:55:27.489 --> 01:55:33.614]  Well, number one, as I said, Martin Luther King and all those guys sold the blacks to the Democratic Party.
[01:55:34.054 --> 01:55:42.041]  And then the media and the race hustlers, the black race hustlers, start accusing the white part, the Republican Party, of being white.
[01:55:42.461 --> 01:55:50.147]  And they were saying things like, all the Democrats went over to the Republican Party, and those are the people who are controlling the blacks.
[01:55:50.507 --> 01:55:51.087]  We're good to go.
[01:56:20.196 --> 01:56:20.896]  Not at all, not at all.
[01:56:21.077 --> 01:56:25.139]  But most black people now are on the side of evil rather than good.
[01:56:25.239 --> 01:56:26.920]  It wasn't like that when I was growing up.
[01:56:37.952 --> 01:56:42.895]  Yeah, Christianity is the most hated religion on this side of heaven.
[01:56:43.395 --> 01:56:48.538]  And number one, the blacks hate it because they've been told that it's a white man religion.
[01:56:48.878 --> 01:56:52.160]  So because they hate white people, they hate Christianity.
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:55.502]  And I see that happening more and more in this country right now.
[01:56:55.922 --> 01:56:59.604]  And you see around the world, Christians are under attack.
[01:57:00.024 --> 01:57:03.787]  And there's no discussion about it because it's a white man's religion.
[01:57:03.947 --> 01:57:06.429]  It's not true, but that's what the people have been told.
[01:57:06.869 --> 01:57:10.973]  That's why white Americans gotta start speaking up before it's too late.
[01:57:11.513 --> 01:57:15.016]  If ever there were a time to speak up, it's now.
[01:57:15.416 --> 01:57:17.678]  Look how they're doing us with the so-called Chinese
[01:57:19.338 --> 01:57:21.519]  This thing is not as bad as they're pretending.
[01:57:21.839 --> 01:57:27.060]  But what the Democrats have realized, and the right-wing Republicans, is that they can control the people.
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:29.461]  They can put a mask on.
[01:57:29.841 --> 01:57:35.062]  They can make you stay home for months and lose your businesses and have to depend on the government.
[01:57:35.382 --> 01:57:37.423]  They can tell you when and when not to.
[01:57:37.663 --> 01:57:39.943]  They can teach you you're not essential.
[01:57:40.043 --> 01:57:44.684]  All the big corporations, talk about racism or inequity or a new class.
[01:57:45.124 --> 01:57:47.165]  All these big companies are essential, but we're not.
[01:57:48.112 --> 01:58:00.840]  Right, and our businesses are probably more essential than theirs because we're small businesses and small businesses are very valuable to the communities, to the neighborhoods, and they don't want that around, Alice.
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.281]  They want to control us.
[01:58:02.682 --> 01:58:11.007]  This is about getting President Trump out of the White House because if they can get rid of him, then they can turn the country into a socialist society.
[01:58:11.027 --> 01:58:12.348]  Let's talk about what happens if they're
[01:58:12.808 --> 01:58:14.129]  I'll get rid of Trump, but I agree with you.
[01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:20.555]  When I'm driving through places now, I just pull in little places and get stuff because they literally, they say, thank you for being here.
[01:58:20.595 --> 01:58:21.696]  We're about to go bankrupt.
[01:58:22.657 --> 01:58:24.018]  It's so obvious what's happening.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:25.540]  That's right.
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:32.162]  If they get rid of President Trump, and again I call him the Great White Hope, we're going to have a socialist society.
[01:58:32.723 --> 01:58:38.765]  White people's homes and land will be taken away from them, and there will be no law to protect them from it.
[01:58:39.105 --> 01:58:43.666]  They're going to ban, they want to ban out of a Second Amendment right to bear arm.
[01:58:44.026 --> 01:58:46.007]  They don't want us speaking the truth.
[01:58:46.047 --> 01:58:47.468]  They don't want a second opinion.
[01:58:47.488 --> 01:58:48.648]  They don't want the truth out there.
[01:58:49.068 --> 01:58:54.170]  They want the lie, because the lie deceives, and you can control people when you lie to them.
[01:58:54.230 --> 01:58:58.011]  But if people are about the truth, you cannot control them.
[01:58:58.431 --> 01:59:02.632]  And so, that's all going to end if these people should take over.
[01:59:02.952 --> 01:59:08.094]  We cannot let President Trump not, we cannot allow them not- You're absolutely right.
[01:59:08.114 --> 01:59:09.874]  Let's talk about it with Jesse Lee Peterson.
[01:59:09.894 --> 01:59:10.795]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:10.815 --> 01:59:11.215]  Stay with us.
[01:59:11.255 --> 01:59:11.975]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:14.397 --> 01:59:15.338]  You know what's coming.
[01:59:15.578 --> 01:59:17.180]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:20.524]  Robots use face scanning AI to ask people to wear masks.
[01:59:21.164 --> 01:59:23.126]  It's now in America, not in China.
[01:59:24.027 --> 01:59:25.209]  Video, Portland Antifa.
[01:59:27.156 --> 01:59:30.179]  Stabbed in the breast, runs to police, asks for them to save him.
[01:59:30.679 --> 01:59:36.103]  Chicago leaders call for Illinois to abolish history classes until a less racist curriculum is formed.
[01:59:36.524 --> 01:59:41.468]  That's exactly what Jesse Lee Peterson was saying earlier, is they don't want history taught.
[01:59:42.168 --> 01:59:44.610]  Because if you look at the West, we've had our own problems.
[01:59:44.650 --> 01:59:45.451]  Lord knows we're evil.
[01:59:45.731 --> 01:59:46.232]  We're fallen.
[01:59:47.233 --> 01:59:55.235]  Compared to other places, we pioneered trying to stop slavery and pioneered empowering women and children and everybody else.
[01:59:56.055 --> 01:59:57.276]  Jesse Lee Peterson is here.
[01:59:57.336 --> 01:59:58.716]  He's got some of the solutions.
[01:59:58.736 --> 02:00:01.397]  He's reached over a billion people in his work.
[02:00:01.937 --> 02:00:04.278]  The antidote to all the chaos in inner cities.
[02:00:04.698 --> 02:00:06.078]  Let's cut to the chase on that.
[02:00:06.498 --> 02:00:07.739]  What do we need to do?
[02:00:07.799 --> 02:00:08.979]  What does Trump need to do?
[02:00:09.179 --> 02:00:10.039]  What do I need to do?
[02:00:10.879 --> 02:00:12.900]  Number one, Alex, this is a really good question.
[02:00:13.904 --> 02:00:23.289]  I remember, I thought about it during the break, when the way they took over black people, the number one way they took over the lives of black Americans, was to get rid of the fathers.
[02:00:23.749 --> 02:00:27.511]  When I was growing up, there were fathers and grandfathers around.
[02:00:27.892 --> 02:00:30.113]  I grew up around my fathers and grandfathers.
[02:00:30.593 --> 02:00:39.142]  But what happened was, they worked on the black man until they finally got him out of the home, and the government replaced the man inside the home.
[02:00:39.602 --> 02:00:44.707]  And once they did that, they took over the women and children, and it's just not been the same since.
[02:00:44.748 --> 02:00:50.093]  There's an order to life, and that order, whether we know it or not, like it or not, accept it or agree to it,
[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:55.104]  God in Christ, Christ in man, man over woman and woman over children.
[02:00:55.425 --> 02:00:58.988]  The love comes from God, through Christ, through the man, through the woman, through the children.
[02:00:59.268 --> 02:01:01.791]  And that's a perfect order, and that order works.
[02:01:02.151 --> 02:01:08.377]  And you can't brainwash people and use them for your personal gain when they grow up under that order.
[02:01:08.557 --> 02:01:09.538]  Let's talk about that!
[02:01:09.898 --> 02:01:15.163]  I mean, listen, and men are willing to die for their women, die for their children, doesn't mean the women don't have power, but let's explain.
[02:01:15.203 --> 02:01:19.808]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[02:01:19.868 --> 02:01:26.434]  My dad grew up in East Texas, when Jim Crow and all that was going out, and his dad was standing up to it, but he said it was crazy.
[02:01:26.474 --> 02:01:26.815]  He said,
[02:01:27.575 --> 02:01:31.358]  We're not defending segregation, but they replaced one thing with something even more evil.
[02:01:31.818 --> 02:01:34.100]  Black people, he said, dressed as sharp as anybody.
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:35.961]  They owned hotels, businesses.
[02:01:36.401 --> 02:01:39.183]  They were in charge of themselves under that oppression.
[02:01:39.623 --> 02:01:43.766]  And as soon as the money came in to end the family, it all disintegrated.
[02:01:44.166 --> 02:01:45.967]  And of course, LBJ wrote letters bragging.
[02:01:45.987 --> 02:01:48.849]  He said, my great society will destroy the black people.
[02:01:49.210 --> 02:01:50.210]  It'll make them slaves.
[02:01:51.411 --> 02:01:59.359]  As soon as they got the men out, which is the feminist message, the Black Lives Matter message, get rid of the nuclear family, now it's a bunch of women and children the government can control.
[02:01:59.379 --> 02:02:05.045]  I mean, it's very obvious that when you're enslaving a group, you don't want them to have warriors, men, to defend them.
[02:02:05.905 --> 02:02:06.385]  That's right.
[02:02:06.525 --> 02:02:11.727]  Anytime you're at war, if you're attacked by another country, they're going to go after the men first.
[02:02:12.087 --> 02:02:15.708]  Because the power is in the man, and they know that, so they got to get rid of him.
[02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:18.049]  And that's what they did to black Americans.
[02:02:18.429 --> 02:02:23.671]  They replaced the man with government, as you said, and now it's been downhill for black women and children.
[02:02:24.568 --> 02:02:27.749]  If you notice, Alex, they're doing the same thing to the white man.
[02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:31.370]  And I've been saying for years to white men, you've got to protect your family.
[02:02:31.710 --> 02:02:35.110]  You've got to speak up because they're trying to turn your family against you.
[02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:41.252]  If they can get rid of the white man, it's going to be easy to destroy the country.
[02:02:41.372 --> 02:02:46.313]  If you talk to your wife and children before they get them about it, they get it and come tell you.
[02:02:46.353 --> 02:02:48.733]  But if you never know about it, they're going to turn against you.
[02:02:49.153 --> 02:02:51.534]  How do you get to where your wife and your children understand this?
[02:02:52.622 --> 02:02:54.944]  You have to be right and do right.
[02:02:54.964 --> 02:02:56.465]  You have to be a man of character.
[02:02:56.925 --> 02:03:05.392]  And when your wife and kids see that, they're going to see the light of God inside of you, and that will draw them unto you, and you can guide them in the right way.
[02:03:05.472 --> 02:03:07.093]  So you've got to be a servant.
[02:03:07.133 --> 02:03:12.717]  You've got to get them to do the right thing, but you've got to carry out the trash, help them, cook the dinner, be there for them, not just watch sports all day.
[02:03:12.997 --> 02:03:14.679]  You've got to serve them, they'll serve you.
[02:03:15.439 --> 02:03:23.785]  You gotta be right in order for them to do right, because if you're right, women love men who love what's right with all their heart, soul, and mind.
[02:03:24.065 --> 02:03:26.888]  They trust that kind of man, and they will follow that man.
[02:03:26.948 --> 02:03:29.630]  Likewise, if children will follow the mother, things will be fine.
[02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:36.895]  But if the man is not of righteousness, if he's not right, he's not going to be able to guide his wife and children in the right way to go.
[02:03:37.275 --> 02:03:38.136]  And it's not about
[02:03:39.056 --> 02:03:41.637]  Who's better than, it's just the order of God.
[02:03:42.177 --> 02:03:44.037]  That's why he ordained a family.
[02:03:44.077 --> 02:03:49.599]  He created man and woman and he married them under his umbrella so that he could guide them.
[02:03:49.959 --> 02:03:55.680]  But when you break that order by getting rid of the man, then there's no light, there's no love there to protect the woman.
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:03:56.360]  Well, we need to know that.
[02:03:56.420 --> 02:04:03.682]  When the man's gone, whoever's in power is now, whether it's Stalin, Hitler, or Mao, or Nancy Pelosi, that's now your husband.
[02:04:04.735 --> 02:04:05.456]  That's right.
[02:04:05.916 --> 02:04:07.017]  And that's a raw husband.
[02:04:07.037 --> 02:04:08.978]  You don't want that one.
[02:04:09.038 --> 02:04:11.340]  We have to re-establish the family.
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:15.383]  And I'm saying to white men, you cannot give in to this crap.
[02:04:15.443 --> 02:04:19.066]  Don't let them take over the minds and hearts of your children.
[02:04:19.406 --> 02:04:20.406]  Look what happened, Alex.
[02:04:20.447 --> 02:04:25.030]  They sent the kids off to school, and now the white kids have become Antifa.
[02:04:25.570 --> 02:04:35.498]  They have no business being a part of Antifa, but the education system have turned them against the father, against the family, and now they love evil and hate good.
[02:04:35.838 --> 02:04:37.559]  We gotta restore that family.
[02:04:37.659 --> 02:04:44.204]  It's man and woman getting married, having children, being there for your family, and guiding them, protecting them in the right way to go.
[02:04:44.585 --> 02:04:50.409]  And don't let the educational system, which is a government system, corrupt the hearts and minds of your kids.
[02:04:50.749 --> 02:04:53.932]  They have the kids having sex out of wet lots, smoking pot,
[02:04:54.392 --> 02:04:58.514]  They're pushing everything that's wrong, living together before marriage.
[02:04:58.875 --> 02:05:02.877]  When they can destroy your character, then you have nothing to stand on.
[02:05:02.917 --> 02:05:11.782]  But when you are a man or woman of morality, of character, you have a solid foundation, and you cannot be deceived by the children of the lie.
[02:05:12.262 --> 02:05:21.790]  And the children of the law, the liberal media, the Democratic Party, the black race hustlers, the right-wing Republicans, and the Never-Trumpers, they are the children of the law.
[02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:23.532]  They are feeding the minds of the children.
[02:05:23.872 --> 02:05:25.773]  The parents should prevent that from happening.
[02:05:26.054 --> 02:05:30.618]  Jesse Lee Peterson, when you were first starting out, I knew about you 25 years ago.
[02:05:30.638 --> 02:05:33.400]  How long have you been on the air?
[02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:34.000]  30 years now.
[02:05:34.301 --> 02:05:35.121]  It's amazing.
[02:05:35.542 --> 02:05:37.723]  Well, what you said is all prophetic and it's happening now.
[02:05:38.726 --> 02:05:41.289]  But a long time ago, we were really under the gun.
[02:05:41.549 --> 02:05:42.410]  People weren't listening to us.
[02:05:42.430 --> 02:05:46.413]  Now, I don't want to be too positive, but man, people are really listening now, aren't they?
[02:05:46.654 --> 02:05:47.494]  People seem to get it.
[02:05:47.614 --> 02:05:48.455]  Women seem to get it.
[02:05:48.796 --> 02:05:49.636]  Men seem to get it.
[02:05:49.957 --> 02:05:51.578]  But men just can't say they're the leader.
[02:05:51.598 --> 02:05:52.799]  They need to be the leader.
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.421]  That means they're going to work two jobs.
[02:05:54.721 --> 02:05:56.263]  They're going to take care of kids when they're sick.
[02:05:56.503 --> 02:05:57.604]  They're going to bust their ass.
[02:05:58.305 --> 02:06:01.488]  Being a leader means you're going to work your ass off, not sit back and watch sports.
[02:06:02.335 --> 02:06:05.637]  You have to be the example of what you want your family to become.
[02:06:05.998 --> 02:06:09.440]  Because they're looking at you and whatever you are is what they will become.
[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.781]  So the men have to be that.
[02:06:11.222 --> 02:06:12.362]  And they have to be men.
[02:06:12.543 --> 02:06:13.804]  It's okay to be men.
[02:06:14.204 --> 02:06:16.185]  It's okay to be a man, right?
[02:06:16.686 --> 02:06:18.727]  And so we are pointing them back to the sword.
[02:06:18.747 --> 02:06:20.188]  They gotta return to their fathers.
[02:06:20.549 --> 02:06:23.631]  They gotta forgive their mothers for the mistakes that they made with them.
[02:06:24.091 --> 02:06:24.932]  Love their fathers.
[02:06:25.012 --> 02:06:27.854]  And through loving your earthly father, you can love God.
[02:06:28.214 --> 02:06:31.577]  And in that, your nature will be created in the image of God.
[02:06:32.137 --> 02:06:33.519]  And it would be amazing, Alex.
[02:06:33.819 --> 02:06:38.003]  When I was growing up under the Jim Crow laws, I have an aunt who got married.
[02:06:38.083 --> 02:06:40.545]  They had like 14 or 15 children.
[02:06:40.946 --> 02:06:42.167]  They own their own land.
[02:06:42.587 --> 02:06:47.572]  They sent all 15 of their children to college.
[02:06:47.893 --> 02:06:48.893]  They're all professionals.
[02:06:49.314 --> 02:06:51.296]  Even though I don't push college a lot, I think that
[02:06:51.616 --> 02:07:04.082]  No, what you're saying is, in an under an evil system that still had a family, they got stronger, as Nietzsche said, that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger, so they want to make you a victim, so you come to them so they can run things, and then you get nothing.
[02:07:04.282 --> 02:07:07.324]  You're saying under Jim Crow, Southern oppression...
[02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:10.651]  They left the family alone, you still got stronger.
[02:07:10.891 --> 02:07:13.632]  But under their sneaky, evil liberalism, everybody dies.
[02:07:14.572 --> 02:07:15.152]  Absolutely.
[02:07:15.532 --> 02:07:23.755]  My aunts and uncles, when they all became young adults, they moved off to other parts of Alabama, Florida, Indiana, those places.
[02:07:24.115 --> 02:07:28.576]  They got jobs, they bought homes, they got married, they had families.
[02:07:29.136 --> 02:07:33.458]  Because they knew they were being oppressed, so they decided to fight and be strong.
[02:07:33.738 --> 02:07:36.479]  Instead of saying, I'm a loser, I'm going to roll over and die.
[02:07:37.319 --> 02:07:40.340]  Yeah, but when we were growing up, I didn't know anything about oppression.
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:42.600]  We were not oppressed.
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:43.580]  We loved what was right.
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:44.421]  We had families.
[02:07:44.781 --> 02:07:45.821]  We were taught to work.
[02:07:46.321 --> 02:07:50.262]  I was told from day one, when I turned 18 years old, I had to leave home.
[02:07:50.762 --> 02:07:55.463]  So they taught me how to work, how to be responsible, how to save my money.
[02:07:55.943 --> 02:07:59.324]  And so when I turned 18, I remember my grandmother telling me, Alex,
[02:07:59.964 --> 02:08:02.065]  Part G, when you're 18, you're out of here.
[02:08:02.445 --> 02:08:03.586]  I'm like, well, where am I going?
[02:08:03.606 --> 02:08:06.127]  She's like, I don't know and I don't care.
[02:08:06.207 --> 02:08:06.968]  You're out of here.
[02:08:07.348 --> 02:08:08.449]  We're preparing you for it.
[02:08:08.729 --> 02:08:10.630]  And when I turned 18, I left home.
[02:08:11.010 --> 02:08:11.890]  I haven't looked back.
[02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:14.592]  I worked, I went through a lot of stuff.
[02:08:14.852 --> 02:08:16.253]  I'm saying they say that's oppression.
[02:08:16.273 --> 02:08:17.273]  We're not defending that system.
[02:08:17.493 --> 02:08:21.095]  But at least that system was a human system that was making you strong.
[02:08:21.536 --> 02:08:25.698]  And just think about the one now where people have three degrees but no job and they're just pissed off.
[02:08:26.756 --> 02:08:27.317]  That's right.
[02:08:27.337 --> 02:08:30.159]  That word wasn't even heard of, man.
[02:08:30.239 --> 02:08:30.759]  Believe me.
[02:08:31.039 --> 02:08:34.282]  Because our parents and our grandparents were the example.
[02:08:34.702 --> 02:08:39.465]  And so even though the Jim Crow laws were there, we were not affected by those laws.
[02:08:39.546 --> 02:08:43.949]  Because whenever we wanted to visit, whomever we wanted to visit, white people, black people, we did it.
[02:08:44.329 --> 02:08:46.991]  Because all white people didn't go for the Jim Crow law.
[02:08:47.051 --> 02:08:49.073]  It was just some, not all.
[02:08:49.413 --> 02:08:52.315]  And all black people would fall for it and hated white people.
[02:08:52.415 --> 02:08:58.460]  Maybe a few, I don't know about... But the point is, you didn't take it, your identity as a victim, you decided to be successful, that made you overcome.
[02:08:59.383 --> 02:09:01.425]  That's right, because I was raised in that way.
[02:09:01.465 --> 02:09:04.467]  My family set that example, and they taught me to work.
[02:09:04.547 --> 02:09:10.151]  I bought my first home when I was 25 years old, because that's what I was told that we're supposed to do as adults.
[02:09:10.632 --> 02:09:15.636]  You work, you finish high school, get a job, buy yourself a home.
[02:09:15.816 --> 02:09:18.518]  If you want a family, get married and start a family.
[02:09:18.878 --> 02:09:19.899]  It was in my system.
[02:09:19.939 --> 02:09:21.981]  That's all I knew, and that's the way my life went.
[02:09:22.321 --> 02:09:24.743]  I didn't get married, but I did everything else that I was taught.
[02:09:24.763 --> 02:09:24.983]  Powerful.
[02:09:25.043 --> 02:09:27.165]  And now Black Lives Matter says don't have a family.
[02:09:27.810 --> 02:09:29.391]  We'll be right back with the 4th Hour.
[02:09:29.431 --> 02:09:29.871]  Stay with us.
[02:09:31.632 --> 02:09:32.173]  Welcome back.
[02:09:32.233 --> 02:09:33.874]  Alex Jones here with Jesse Lee Peterson.
[02:09:33.914 --> 02:09:38.697]  But getting back to this point, because I studied this actually, and Peterson, you criticized Liz Farrakhan.
[02:09:38.717 --> 02:09:50.684]  I disagree with a lot of what Liz Farrakhan said, but one thing Liz Farrakhan said was that black Americans, particularly, should have their own banks, their own grocery stores, their own businesses for their own communities to have their own strengths.
[02:09:51.365 --> 02:09:55.968]  And other people's businesses do that as well, but if you really want to empower people, don't get welfare from the government.
[02:09:56.690 --> 02:09:58.392]  Create your own society, your own system.
[02:09:59.052 --> 02:10:02.735]  And that's what segregation and Jim Crow created.
[02:10:03.196 --> 02:10:13.425]  Whether you were in Illinois or New York or North Carolina or Tennessee or Texas or Kentucky or Alabama was people actually got successful.
[02:10:14.397 --> 02:10:15.517]  Because they have their own system.
[02:10:15.557 --> 02:10:17.518]  Under globalism, we don't even have our own country.
[02:10:17.958 --> 02:10:19.599]  We have the New World Order dictating.
[02:10:19.639 --> 02:10:21.580]  Trump's trying to have us have our own country.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:22.860]  And Trump is.
[02:10:23.241 --> 02:10:24.881]  Believe me, I know him well and his people.
[02:10:24.921 --> 02:10:25.882]  He wants to empower everybody.
[02:10:26.142 --> 02:10:27.222]  He doesn't want these divisions.
[02:10:27.242 --> 02:10:29.743]  He wants to be the guy that turns it all around and brings us together.
[02:10:30.383 --> 02:10:34.665]  And so you see the Democrats pushing the most racist, divisionary systems.
[02:10:35.305 --> 02:10:37.046]  I believe in America, Jesse Lee Peterson.
[02:10:38.427 --> 02:10:39.947]  I believe we're going to turn against this.
[02:10:40.107 --> 02:10:41.328]  I believe Trump's going to win big.
[02:10:41.368 --> 02:10:41.848]  What do you think?
[02:10:42.734 --> 02:10:43.595]  I believe so too.
[02:10:43.795 --> 02:10:49.738]  I think that the Democrats are so angry and so blind that they can't see that they're exposing themselves.
[02:10:50.218 --> 02:10:58.724]  And with all this violence and all this crime and stuff that's going on, they are scaring people to death because they're revealing who they really are.
[02:10:59.144 --> 02:11:03.466]  So I believe that the president will be re-elected another four more years.
[02:11:03.947 --> 02:11:05.868]  And you mentioned the banks and things like that.
[02:11:06.368 --> 02:11:09.430]  When you're in a community, it's natural.
[02:11:10.262 --> 02:11:15.866]  To start a business, it's natural to have a bank, to have a school, to have a store.
[02:11:16.227 --> 02:11:17.608]  That's what we did in Alabama.
[02:11:18.008 --> 02:11:27.175]  But because black people are so, and not all, not all, not all, not all, not all, but most, they have not, the family have been destroyed so the fathers are not there to set that example.
[02:11:27.675 --> 02:11:31.338]  If black people were not angry, if they had families,
[02:11:31.818 --> 02:11:38.201]  If their parents taught them to work, you would naturally have businesses in the black community.
[02:11:38.221 --> 02:11:39.821]  You wouldn't have to beg people to go there.
[02:11:40.202 --> 02:11:41.582]  You would provide good services.
[02:11:41.902 --> 02:11:45.904]  But because the men are not setting that example as they did when I was growing up,
[02:11:47.050 --> 02:11:51.612]  The crime is out of control in urban cities across the country.
[02:11:53.513 --> 02:11:58.214]  Black people are afraid to open a business because they're afraid of being robbed by other black people.
[02:11:58.675 --> 02:12:02.076]  It's not the white person that they're afraid of, it's the blacks that they're afraid of.
[02:12:02.516 --> 02:12:07.438]  And so you don't have black businesses there because of that out-of-control crime.
[02:12:07.938 --> 02:12:09.980]  What do you think the real numbers are with Kanye and all that?
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:11.461]  Do you think black folks are waking up?
[02:12:11.521 --> 02:12:12.783]  How do you think they're going to vote?
[02:12:28.933 --> 02:12:35.381]  You gotta get more and more black people voting for the Republican Party than we've gotten in years, in a long time.
[02:12:35.921 --> 02:12:41.168]  Because of President Trump, and because of Kanye West, that's why he's hated right now.
[02:12:41.208 --> 02:12:43.631]  Kanye is influencing a lot of millennials.
[02:12:44.071 --> 02:12:46.194]  Oh, I can tell you, I know personally, Kanye's awake.
[02:12:46.254 --> 02:12:47.055]  He knows what's going on.
[02:12:47.768 --> 02:12:50.369]  Yes, but they're trying to make him look crazy.
[02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:56.072]  They're accusing him of being off because he's having an influence within the black community.
[02:12:56.092 --> 02:12:58.854]  All because he's broken free from the plantation, literally.
[02:12:59.174 --> 02:13:00.655]  Yes, that's right.
[02:13:00.955 --> 02:13:03.776]  He's pulling those black votes away from the Democratic Party.
[02:13:04.197 --> 02:13:08.219]  And the worst thing that can happen to the Democratic Party is to lose black votes.
[02:13:08.599 --> 02:13:10.780]  If they lose the black votes, the party is over.
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:16.583]  That's why they are trying to bring the Hispanics in and all that, because they're trying to stay relevant.
[02:13:17.083 --> 02:13:24.228]  If the blacks leave, they won't be relevant and that's why they hate Kanye West or anyone who influenced black people to wake up.
[02:13:24.249 --> 02:13:26.790]  And they think if they have the COVID lockdown, we're going to blame Trump.
[02:13:27.071 --> 02:13:29.993]  Everybody I know knows the Democrats did the lockdown and did this.
[02:13:30.831 --> 02:13:39.296]  Yeah, and it's the Democratic states where you really can't move about if you listen to the Democrats because they don't want the Chinese virus to end.
[02:13:39.656 --> 02:13:40.677]  They want it to be there.
[02:13:40.717 --> 02:13:47.281]  They want to hold it there until election time so that they can blame, as you said, blame President Trump for it.
[02:13:47.802 --> 02:13:52.124]  Anything that the president is for, it doesn't matter how good it is, Alex.
[02:13:52.584 --> 02:13:54.906]  Anything the president is for, they are against it.
[02:13:55.592 --> 02:13:57.173]  Jesus Christ can come down.
[02:13:57.673 --> 02:14:00.735]  And if the president is for him, they're going to be against him.
[02:14:01.075 --> 02:14:04.257]  But if the president says, oh, I don't like Jesus, they'll be for him.
[02:14:04.397 --> 02:14:07.919]  Well, that's why some say he came up with a vaccine, was to get them to back off of it.
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:09.180]  Looks like that's happening.
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:11.982]  Suddenly Democrats were against the vaccine because it came out for it.
[02:14:12.262 --> 02:14:12.762]  I'm like, wow.
[02:14:12.782 --> 02:14:13.943]  That's right.
[02:14:14.063 --> 02:14:15.484]  Well, 60 seconds.
[02:14:15.524 --> 02:14:16.544]  Jesse Lee Peters, stay there.
[02:14:16.564 --> 02:14:16.945]  60 seconds.
[02:14:19.068 --> 02:14:24.133]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson takes over in T-minus 14 minutes.
[02:14:24.834 --> 02:14:33.783]  But right now, the legendary Jesse Lee Peterson of jesselepeterson.com and rebuildingtheman.com is going to host a segment of Alex Jones.
[02:14:33.803 --> 02:14:34.484]  He's agreed to do it.
[02:14:34.704 --> 02:14:35.745]  He's taking over right now.
[02:14:35.825 --> 02:14:36.606]  Jesse Lee Peterson.
[02:14:37.574 --> 02:14:39.215]  So just imagine this, folks.
[02:14:39.536 --> 02:14:42.518]  I am now sitting in the seat of Alex Jones.
[02:14:42.898 --> 02:14:44.360]  It doesn't get any better than that.
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:45.561]  That's amazing.
[02:14:46.061 --> 02:14:49.444]  By the way, I want you to know that our battle is a spiritual battle.
[02:14:49.524 --> 02:14:51.846]  It's a warfare between good and evil.
[02:14:52.346 --> 02:14:53.427]  It's not about color.
[02:14:53.527 --> 02:14:55.028]  It's not about men and women.
[02:14:55.429 --> 02:14:57.310]  It's about right versus wrong.
[02:14:57.771 --> 02:14:59.072]  It's not about racism.
[02:14:59.612 --> 02:15:08.501]  No such thing as racism, sexism, homophobism, Islamophobism, dare-be-dare-ism, or white supremacism, or anti-semitism.
[02:15:09.041 --> 02:15:12.225]  It's either right or wrong, good or evil.
[02:15:12.645 --> 02:15:13.966]  And that's what it's all about.
[02:15:14.387 --> 02:15:21.734]  And for the men, you have been given a responsibility by God to love Him with all your heart, soul, and might.
[02:15:22.387 --> 02:15:29.169]  If you want a family, get married, love your wife, and guide your wife and children in the right way to go to protect them from evil.
[02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:36.351]  But when you're not there and you're not guiding your family, it's easy for the liars, the children of the lie, to take over.
[02:15:36.691 --> 02:15:37.932]  It's not about racism.
[02:15:37.972 --> 02:15:39.372]  Stop falling for the crap.
[02:15:39.812 --> 02:15:44.414]  It's not about anti-Semitism or sexism and all that ism.
[02:15:44.774 --> 02:15:46.274]  It's about right versus wrong.
[02:15:46.614 --> 02:15:48.455]  So we gotta rebuild the family.
[02:15:48.815 --> 02:15:51.276]  Men, you gotta stand up because when you're weak,
[02:15:51.876 --> 02:15:53.097]  It's over for the family.
[02:15:53.237 --> 02:15:54.898]  We gotta re-establish that family.
[02:15:55.318 --> 02:15:58.099]  And this whole thing about Black Lives Matter means nothing.
[02:15:58.499 --> 02:16:01.641]  To say the words Black Lives Matter means nothing.
[02:16:02.081 --> 02:16:03.842]  It's just a form of controlling you.
[02:16:04.983 --> 02:16:20.731]  As I said to Alex earlier, I never imagined that one day we would see a day when grown Christian men and women, police officers, people from the armed forces are bowing down to far-left, liberal, radical
[02:16:21.471 --> 02:16:23.532]  Hateful, fat, black, lesbian.
[02:16:24.232 --> 02:16:24.812]  What the?
[02:16:25.432 --> 02:16:26.352]  I can't believe it.
[02:16:26.692 --> 02:16:28.513]  That's amazing to see that.
[02:16:28.913 --> 02:16:29.733]  We gotta stop it.
[02:16:29.753 --> 02:16:34.955]  These people literally burning down our cities, our towns, destroying businesses.
[02:16:36.115 --> 02:16:40.336]  There have been black people who have died as a result of this terrorist attack upon America.
[02:16:40.776 --> 02:16:42.057]  They don't care about life.
[02:16:42.257 --> 02:16:43.297]  They don't care about people.
[02:16:43.337 --> 02:16:44.357]  Look at Chicago.
[02:16:44.817 --> 02:16:46.978]  Chicago crime is through the roof.
[02:16:47.856 --> 02:16:49.738]  And it's not about Floyd either.
[02:16:50.118 --> 02:16:51.439]  What was Floyd's first name?
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:52.821]  George Floyd.
[02:16:53.141 --> 02:16:59.547]  We just saw a video this morning put out by the Daily Mail that George Floyd resisted arrest.
[02:17:00.433 --> 02:17:03.214]  He resisted and that's why he's dead today.
[02:17:03.294 --> 02:17:10.176]  It's not because of some police brutality or black people under attack by the white man or systemic racism.
[02:17:10.596 --> 02:17:17.698]  Floyd resisted arrest and he seemed to be on some type of drug and it's being reported that he was high on something.
[02:17:18.363 --> 02:17:31.467]  And so it was about that, but they don't want you to know that because they want to use that to cry racism so that they can cause you to become afraid and not stand up for the country and for what is right.
[02:17:31.827 --> 02:17:33.027]  We got to stand together.
[02:17:33.527 --> 02:17:35.208]  It's good against evil.
[02:17:35.628 --> 02:17:40.149]  So you have to overcome evil and stand up with good and fight it.
[02:17:40.569 --> 02:17:41.629]  Otherwise, it's over.
[02:17:41.649 --> 02:17:43.910]  And men, you are needed.
[02:17:44.602 --> 02:17:45.482]  You are needed.
[02:17:45.622 --> 02:17:49.424]  God and Christ, Christ and man, man over woman, woman over children.
[02:17:49.684 --> 02:17:51.144]  There is no way else to go.
[02:17:51.644 --> 02:17:57.586]  America is the greatest country on this side of heaven, given to us by God.
[02:17:57.887 --> 02:17:58.907]  We have to protect it.
[02:17:59.727 --> 02:18:03.388]  All races of men and women, we got to stand up and protect our country.
[02:18:03.408 --> 02:18:04.529]  There's no way else to go.
[02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:06.650]  Not that I'm aware of.
[02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:10.691]  And we will have South Africa in America if you don't stand up.
[02:18:11.368 --> 02:18:12.569]  They're coming for your land.
[02:18:12.889 --> 02:18:23.338]  They've already taken your institutions like schools and they're letting in prisons out of jail and they're coming for your land next because they see that you will not stand up.
[02:18:23.798 --> 02:18:28.322]  And if you doubt me, talk to some white people from South Africa and decent blacks from there.
[02:18:28.362 --> 02:18:29.683]  They know what's going on.
[02:18:30.143 --> 02:18:33.526]  And some of them cannot believe that we're allowing it to happen in this country.
[02:18:33.926 --> 02:18:35.948]  We got to re-elect President Trump.
[02:18:36.188 --> 02:18:37.109]  We have no other choice.
[02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:38.890]  We got to reelect him.
[02:18:39.271 --> 02:18:40.612]  We must rebuild the family.
[02:18:41.032 --> 02:18:48.159]  Men, you got to come out of your mama's closet, out of your mama's basement, go out and deal with life because the world needs you.
[02:18:48.519 --> 02:18:49.540]  We got to restore it.
[02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:52.603]  So I want you to check us out at rebuildingtheman.com.
[02:18:52.823 --> 02:18:54.124]  I love what Alex is doing.
[02:18:54.464 --> 02:18:55.445]  We need more of this.
[02:18:55.906 --> 02:18:57.767]  He has a great team on his network.
[02:18:58.088 --> 02:18:58.808]  We need more.
[02:18:59.329 --> 02:19:00.890]  We got to save this country.
[02:19:01.331 --> 02:19:02.752]  If they get rid of Donald Trump,
[02:19:03.792 --> 02:19:04.113]  That's right.
[02:19:21.448 --> 02:19:21.608]  I don't
[02:19:35.197 --> 02:19:43.323]  Black slavery or something, Dom, and LGBTQ, they want to do everything they can to demoralize you.
[02:19:43.343 --> 02:19:49.007]  And that's how they control you, because you cannot control a more people or person.
[02:19:49.527 --> 02:19:52.750]  You have to demoralize them in order to control them.
[02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:56.993]  I'm talking with men and women from around the world.
[02:19:57.779 --> 02:19:58.660]  All around the world.
[02:19:58.780 --> 02:19:59.741]  And it's the same.
[02:20:00.222 --> 02:20:03.886]  If you destroy that family, you destroy the souls of the kids.
[02:20:04.066 --> 02:20:05.047]  You can't control them.
[02:20:05.468 --> 02:20:07.169]  So we've got to take back our schools.
[02:20:07.269 --> 02:20:10.153]  I said you're taking over and I'm listening here riveted.
[02:20:10.793 --> 02:20:11.154]  You're right.
[02:20:11.194 --> 02:20:12.355]  That's that's actually you're right.
[02:20:12.395 --> 02:20:13.616]  Michigan and Illinois.
[02:20:13.757 --> 02:20:14.477]  I was looking this morning.
[02:20:14.517 --> 02:20:17.260]  A bunch of states are saying it read a history period.
[02:20:17.981 --> 02:20:25.865]  And if a bunch of multinational corporations that run slave camps in China, like Apple and Nike, if we'll hate ourselves, they'll come in and take us over.
[02:20:25.885 --> 02:20:33.649]  If we don't stand up for ourselves and say, no, we're good, we're not bad, we're proud of America, we have a great history, all of us together, how dare you?
[02:20:33.669 --> 02:20:36.811]  I mean, I see them trying to collapse America and the dollar.
[02:20:37.811 --> 02:20:40.532]  I'd say the Chinese currency will be the new currency.
[02:20:40.553 --> 02:20:48.557]  I mean, these people are working against their own country, even though most Democrats aren't even going to be successful if this happens.
[02:20:48.857 --> 02:20:54.380]  It's going to destroy them, but somehow they were taught to hate a country that gave them so much.
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:57.701]  People come here, though, from other countries, and they're happy.
[02:20:58.062 --> 02:21:00.243]  With all our problems, we're still the best country on Earth.
[02:21:01.215 --> 02:21:01.995]  That's right, man.
[02:21:02.055 --> 02:21:03.696]  Look at the basketball team.
[02:21:03.716 --> 02:21:11.977]  They're going over to China, and they're protecting China, but they come back home to America and they kneel during the national anthem.
[02:21:12.318 --> 02:21:13.218]  Where is their love?
[02:21:13.578 --> 02:21:14.938]  Which country do they love better?
[02:21:15.478 --> 02:21:16.678]  America or China?
[02:21:17.079 --> 02:21:19.959]  We gotta stop supporting these teams that are supporting China.
[02:21:19.979 --> 02:21:20.259]  That's right.
[02:21:20.279 --> 02:21:23.080]  Maybe 15, 20 black men are killed by cops wrong every year.
[02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:24.500]  There are some bad cops at SAB.
[02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:25.060]  We're against it.
[02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:27.481]  You get hundreds of thousands of blacks killed.
[02:21:28.061 --> 02:21:31.205]  You know, by other blacks, they don't care, and it's all terrible.
[02:21:31.525 --> 02:21:38.053]  And then literally all these millionaires bow down, but they won't even criticize China with slave camps in any way.
[02:21:38.093 --> 02:21:39.014]  How pathetic is that?
[02:21:39.174 --> 02:21:40.315]  Because here's the thing.
[02:21:41.164 --> 02:21:42.425]  It's not those black players' fault.
[02:21:42.865 --> 02:21:54.194]  It's the owners of the teams that put Black Lives Matter on the court and are telling them to say that so they can hide their Chinese death camps under the guise of, oh, we're with black people, so we're not racist.
[02:21:54.234 --> 02:21:54.614]  That's all.
[02:21:54.814 --> 02:21:59.298]  They're using black people as the shield for their evil communist support.
[02:22:00.236 --> 02:22:01.637]  That's right, that's why I said it.
[02:22:02.318 --> 02:22:04.320]  Black people haven't always been that way.
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:07.082]  They were on the side of good, and I remember growing up that way.
[02:22:07.582 --> 02:22:11.145]  But because they had been so demoralized, their family had been destroyed.
[02:22:11.185 --> 02:22:21.334]  My dad grew up with a lot of black folks in East Texas, and so did I, but they were like super Christian, super successful, and super neurotic about standing up for themselves.
[02:22:21.875 --> 02:22:24.217]  How did it totally shift like that?
[02:22:25.529 --> 02:22:39.983]  Well they did, as I said, when they took the fathers out of the home, and the blacks, uh, they start catering to the women and children by giving them free stuff, free government, welfare checks, and as black race hustlers like Jesse Jackson and others became the head of the people.
[02:22:40.003 --> 02:22:40.624]  So it's like flipping a switch.
[02:22:40.664 --> 02:22:42.746]  They took the fathers out, and it was over.
[02:22:42.766 --> 02:22:42.846]  Yes.
[02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:47.361]  Yeah, and if you pay attention, that's what's happening to the white family as well.
[02:22:47.381 --> 02:22:48.182]  Oh yeah, it's happening, I know.
[02:22:48.242 --> 02:22:57.185]  I guarantee you, I guarantee you, if those black guys that are kneeling, if they had decent fathers and mothers in their homes, they would not be kneeling.
[02:22:57.465 --> 02:22:59.866]  They would not be giving in to that type of evil.
[02:22:59.886 --> 02:23:00.966]  They would love their country.
[02:23:01.486 --> 02:23:06.850]  And the only way this is gonna end, the sports fans gotta stop supporting the sports.
[02:23:06.931 --> 02:23:13.476]  They gotta stop putting their money buying these people's stuff, because as long as you pay them, they're never gonna do right.
[02:23:13.636 --> 02:23:19.000]  But if you can let them see that they're wrong by not supporting them, then the change will come.
[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:21.642]  It's about the power, it's about the money and the wealth.
[02:23:21.702 --> 02:23:22.923]  It's not about anything else.
[02:23:23.223 --> 02:23:27.387]  And it's the big corporations allied with China that killed five times what Hitler did.
[02:23:27.887 --> 02:23:28.829]  Telling us we're bad.
[02:23:28.929 --> 02:23:30.572]  No, you're bad, Communist China.
[02:23:31.093 --> 02:23:31.734]  Just let you pass.
[02:23:31.754 --> 02:23:33.177]  Join us again very soon.
[02:23:33.657 --> 02:23:34.940]  Rebuildingtheman.com.
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:35.481]  We love you.
[02:23:35.721 --> 02:23:38.766]  We love seeing you on OWN, and we really appreciate you spending time with us, sir.
[02:23:39.687 --> 02:23:40.247]  Thank you, man.
[02:23:40.448 --> 02:23:41.368]  Oh, it is amazing.
[02:23:41.408 --> 02:23:42.469]  I love going on there with you.
[02:23:42.509 --> 02:23:43.590]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:23:43.710 --> 02:23:46.812]  I love what you're doing and anything we can do to help, let me know, alright?
[02:23:47.132 --> 02:23:50.915]  Well, anytime you want to fly out with your crew and host the show for a couple days, please come.
[02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:52.135]  Jesse Lee Peterson, God bless you.
[02:23:52.316 --> 02:23:52.616]  I will.
[02:23:53.076 --> 02:23:53.396]  Thank you.
[02:23:53.416 --> 02:23:53.937]  You too, buddy.
[02:23:53.957 --> 02:23:55.238]  Alright, another man on fire.
[02:23:55.258 --> 02:23:55.838]  That's what they hate.
[02:23:56.278 --> 02:23:59.921]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson from London, England takes over straight ahead.
[02:23:59.981 --> 02:24:00.461]  Stay with us.
[02:24:00.481 --> 02:24:03.663]  And then the War Room in 45 minutes with Owen Schroyer.
[02:24:03.984 --> 02:24:04.384]  Stay with us.
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:14.462]  We are live, and the scientific dictatorship of the elite continues to sink in its talons that bit deeper.
[02:24:14.662 --> 02:24:25.385]  I'm here in Spain, where the wearing of a face mask is mandatory, not just inside public buildings, not just inside any kind of building, but even on the street.
[02:24:25.965 --> 02:24:26.545]  It's the law.
[02:24:26.585 --> 02:24:29.186]  You have to wear a face mask everywhere you go.
[02:24:29.706 --> 02:24:35.087]  You can only take it off when you're eating at a restaurant, basically, even if you want to go to the toilet.
[02:24:36.078 --> 02:24:40.401]  You have to put on a face mask to make that 20-yard journey to the toilet.
[02:24:41.422 --> 02:24:45.686]  And who's going to be enforcing this new regime of face mask tyranny?
[02:24:46.006 --> 02:24:53.632]  As Dr. Birx, as we had the article yesterday, now suggests that Americans may have to wear face masks inside their own homes.
[02:24:54.052 --> 02:24:55.173]  Who's going to enforce that?
[02:24:55.788 --> 02:24:58.951]  Who's going to enforce it inside travel hubs, inside airports?
[02:24:58.992 --> 02:25:04.838]  Well, it looks like it's going to be done by our artificially intelligent robotic friends.
[02:25:05.178 --> 02:25:08.902]  We have a video regarding this, which we're going to roll here in a second, headline.
[02:25:10.264 --> 02:25:14.208]  Robot uses face scanning AI to ask people to wear a mask.
[02:25:14.890 --> 02:25:19.476]  A robot normally used to provide customer service now has a new mission.
[02:25:20.017 --> 02:25:27.386]  Scanning your face with AI technology to check whether you're wearing a mask and asking you very nicely to put one on.
[02:25:27.426 --> 02:25:29.248]  Let's go ahead and roll the clip.
[02:25:29.288 --> 02:25:29.769]  Here it is.
[02:25:46.837 --> 02:25:47.517]  Hi, Pepper.
[02:25:47.858 --> 02:25:48.958]  Bonjour, Pepper.
[02:25:49.178 --> 02:25:49.739]  Hey, Pepper.
[02:25:50.179 --> 02:25:50.879]  Hi, Pepper.
[02:25:51.079 --> 02:25:51.780]  Hi, Pepper.
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:52.300]  Thank you.
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:26:10.010]  Good morning.
[02:26:10.350 --> 02:26:12.871]  I think one of you is not wearing a mask.
[02:26:13.372 --> 02:26:15.613]  Please make sure to take a mask from the table.
[02:26:31.653 --> 02:26:34.914]  Now that is SoftBanks Robotics Europe.
[02:26:35.374 --> 02:26:37.434]  And if you're just hearing the audio, you didn't see the video.
[02:26:37.794 --> 02:26:47.756]  Basically, it's a video demonstration which shows the robot scanning people's faces and then telling individuals not wearing a mask to put one on, while thanking those who have complied.
[02:26:47.816 --> 02:26:52.377]  Because as we know, they're the good people, they're the righteously indignant people.
[02:26:52.897 --> 02:26:56.498]  And it also gives them an excuse, as we've seen over the past couple of months now,
[02:26:57.364 --> 02:27:01.949]  To viciously attack people in public, or at least spit and scream in their face.
[02:27:02.470 --> 02:27:06.314]  We're going to get into another story on that score later in the show.
[02:27:07.315 --> 02:27:17.587]  But Engadget reports using an image recognition AI and single-shot detector, Pepper, the cutesy robot, can scan the faces of up to five people at once.
[02:27:18.789 --> 02:27:25.490]  On Pepper's tablet, a green circle will appear around an image of anyone wearing a mask and a red circle will appear around the image of anyone without a mask.
[02:27:25.791 --> 02:27:38.153]  Which is very coincidentally the same technology that we saw in terms of gait analysis and facial recognition of people not properly engaging in social distancing.
[02:27:38.173 --> 02:27:45.975]  You probably remember that video from a couple of months back where it shows an alert going off if people are walking too close to one another.
[02:27:46.621 --> 02:28:00.264]  Which in turn mirrors the social credit score in China, where if people, for example, jaywalk, cross the road too early, a big red box appears around their head, their face is scanned into the system, and then maybe they'll be punished.
[02:28:00.324 --> 02:28:08.947]  Maybe they won't be able to buy train tickets, airplane tickets, maybe they won't be able to renew their driver's license, use a bus, use public transport whatsoever.
[02:28:09.287 --> 02:28:10.067]  Maybe they'll get their
[02:28:10.874 --> 02:28:17.398]  Rights to use the internet taken away entirely because they've been very naughty boys and girls.
[02:28:18.558 --> 02:28:30.505]  But the company, in the case of this Pepper AI robot, asserts that no personal data is used or stored because of course you can trust giant corporations to securely store your data.
[02:28:30.765 --> 02:28:32.946]  Not gone wrong with that, has it?
[02:28:33.626 --> 02:28:40.190]  Although face scanning technology is widely used by both companies and governments in dictatorial states like China to enforce
[02:28:40.592 --> 02:28:44.456]  Compliance and punished social credit score dissidents, as I just explained.
[02:28:45.377 --> 02:28:56.870]  Now of course, this high priestess of the mask cult is all being forced into place despite the fact that experts in numerous other countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden
[02:28:57.518 --> 02:28:59.059]  Say that the masks are pointless.
[02:28:59.319 --> 02:29:01.580]  And this is the point that I've made over and over again.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:16.506]  You will notice the people who wear the masks completely ignore social distancing to the point where they not only brush up against you, they get right in your face and start spitting and snarling at you if you're not wearing a mask.
[02:29:17.406 --> 02:29:21.548]  They're touching the mask, they're adjusting it, they're touching surfaces.
[02:29:22.088 --> 02:29:25.710]  Some people have argued that this mask compliance regime
[02:29:26.448 --> 02:29:29.010]  Could actually be making coronavirus worse.
[02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:33.733]  But experts in the Netherlands and Sweden have said that masks are basically pointless.
[02:29:33.793 --> 02:29:35.674]  I'm going to get onto that article in a minute.
[02:29:37.255 --> 02:29:50.924]  And as I write in this article, in a wider context, the mask has become a symbol of compliance while also facilitating many to virtue signal and express righteously indignant and sometimes violent vitriol towards refuseniks.
[02:29:50.984 --> 02:29:53.426]  And in fact, we have another case of that today.
[02:29:54.246 --> 02:29:59.248]  This, of course, is hot on the heels of numerous confrontations inside Walmarts, inside supermarkets.
[02:30:00.168 --> 02:30:15.334]  And of course, the example in California where a couple trying to have a peaceful picnic in the park, again, completely on their own, not near anyone, were confronted and maced in the face by an elderly woman because they weren't wearing a mask.
[02:30:15.574 --> 02:30:18.495]  Didn't matter that they were in a park on their own trying to eat a picnic.
[02:30:19.056 --> 02:30:27.021]  Apparently now you have to wear a mask even while you're eating, otherwise you might get maced in the face by a mask-wearing NPC.
[02:30:27.061 --> 02:30:28.883]  Now we have this headline out of the UK.
[02:30:29.923 --> 02:30:30.304]  London.
[02:30:30.344 --> 02:30:34.486]  Man with mask not fully covering his face lectures woman about not wearing mask.
[02:30:36.107 --> 02:30:37.508]  And there's a video in this article.
[02:30:37.588 --> 02:30:45.634]  A video shot in the London Underground shows a man wearing an ill-fitting mask that isn't even fully covering his mouth aggressively lecturing another woman for not wearing a mask.
[02:30:47.682 --> 02:30:53.524]  So I was just minding my own business when the mask police came to attack, tweeted the woman involved in the confrontation.
[02:30:54.404 --> 02:30:57.945]  And he's effing and blinding, he's screaming obscenities at her.
[02:30:58.405 --> 02:31:05.107]  He's spitting and snarling as he walks up to her, gets, you know, within the bounds of social distancing.
[02:31:05.127 --> 02:31:08.068]  He's got some kind of dyed blue beard.
[02:31:08.348 --> 02:31:10.668]  The mask isn't even covering his face.
[02:31:11.348 --> 02:31:13.709]  His mouth is hanging out of the bottom of it.
[02:31:14.149 --> 02:31:17.070]  And this is the guy who set himself up as the warden.
[02:31:18.277 --> 02:31:19.918]  The warden for the other prisoners.
[02:31:21.019 --> 02:31:27.824]  Another commuter then attempts to intervene by saying, leave her alone, to which the blue bearded man responds, no, put an effing mask on!
[02:31:29.605 --> 02:31:32.587]  So we see these confrontations every single day.
[02:31:32.627 --> 02:31:34.629]  They only appear to be getting more violent.
[02:31:35.850 --> 02:31:38.592]  They only appear to be escalating to an even greater degree.
[02:31:38.632 --> 02:31:41.674]  Of course, we had the video yesterday of a couple
[02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:49.942]  The female partner threw a hot coffee on a man simply because they had a debate or an argument about mask wearing.
[02:31:50.422 --> 02:31:54.284]  So these people literally feel emboldened because they're the good people, right?
[02:31:54.984 --> 02:31:59.005]  This is like the IRL version of virtue signaling.
[02:31:59.485 --> 02:32:00.505]  I'm a good person.
[02:32:00.726 --> 02:32:01.726]  I'm wearing the mask.
[02:32:02.146 --> 02:32:03.066]  I'm conforming.
[02:32:03.506 --> 02:32:04.147]  I'm obeying.
[02:32:04.507 --> 02:32:05.267]  I'm complaining.
[02:32:05.847 --> 02:32:08.908]  Not only does that give me the right to strut around like I'm some kind of
[02:32:09.617 --> 02:32:10.478]  Superclass!
[02:32:11.058 --> 02:32:14.221]  It gives me the right to get in your face and violently attack you!
[02:32:14.701 --> 02:32:22.447]  This is how these people think and we're emboldening a society full of them and it's only going to get worse.
[02:32:23.327 --> 02:32:36.077]  I'm going to talk about what's happening in the UK in the next segment where people are so panicked by coronavirus in some tourist hotspots they're literally leaping out of the way of people walking in the opposite direction.
[02:32:36.097 --> 02:32:37.118]  We're going to get that to more
[02:32:37.759 --> 02:32:40.241]  On the other side of the break, Summit.News, don't go away.
[02:32:40.821 --> 02:32:50.347]  Now there is no population that has been more terrorised by Covid-19 hysteria than that in the United Kingdom.
[02:32:50.407 --> 02:33:01.555]  There was an Ipsos Mori poll recently which found that 68% of Brits were very concerned about the threat coronavirus poses to their health, compared to 28% who were just fairly concerned.
[02:33:02.015 --> 02:33:04.477]  But that's not the big enchilada here.
[02:33:05.037 --> 02:33:06.438]  This is absolutely insane.
[02:33:07.048 --> 02:33:14.493]  There was a separate survey, and I'm reading here from the Spiked article, the British public has been terrorised.
[02:33:15.333 --> 02:33:26.360]  There was a separate survey which found, get this, on average the British public believes 7% of the UK population has died from coronavirus.
[02:33:27.060 --> 02:33:30.662]  That would amount to a death toll of nearly 5 million.
[02:33:33.897 --> 02:33:52.465]  OK, so the real figure of people who have died from coronavirus in the UK, bearing in mind that, according to the studies, 85% plus of them would have died anyway from other serious illnesses within a few weeks, the official COVID-19 death toll in the UK is 50,000.
[02:33:53.226 --> 02:33:58.748]  And yet the population of the country believes that 5 million people have died from it.
[02:33:59.793 --> 02:34:01.895]  How on earth do they believe that?
[02:34:01.995 --> 02:34:03.216]  What's the explanation?
[02:34:03.517 --> 02:34:09.583]  It's the constant drumbeat of terror, hysteria and propaganda from the mainstream media.
[02:34:10.023 --> 02:34:19.132]  To the point, which I highlight in the article, Corona Paranoia, panicked UK resident describes leaping out of the way to avoid tourists.
[02:34:20.188 --> 02:34:33.834]  To the point where people are afraid to leave their homes because they think that this second wave is already in effect and that this virus is raging and that it's already killed 5 million people in the United Kingdom.
[02:34:36.415 --> 02:34:37.855]  Absolutely insane.
[02:34:38.776 --> 02:34:41.017]  And this is the consensus viewpoint, by the way.
[02:34:41.437 --> 02:34:44.618]  Every single poll that you look at finds 75-80% plus of people
[02:34:47.549 --> 02:34:53.394]  Not only want lockdown to continue, they want it to be more draconian than it ever was in the first place.
[02:34:54.374 --> 02:35:01.100]  I mean, you've got to give the media credit, they've really terrorised people to no extent with this corona paranoia.
[02:35:02.021 --> 02:35:10.027]  And I'm going to get on to the actual average death figures in the UK, which are below normal, even including the Covid deaths.
[02:35:11.974 --> 02:35:14.495]  But this story is funny to say the least.
[02:35:14.535 --> 02:35:18.537]  Corona Paranoia Panicked UK resident describes leaping out of the way to avoid tourists.
[02:35:19.318 --> 02:35:28.862]  So you have a bunch of people from the UK avoiding traveling abroad because now our government has said that they'll have to quarantine for two weeks when they come back.
[02:35:29.523 --> 02:35:34.225]  I'll have to do that personally because I'm coming back from Spain which within
[02:35:35.202 --> 02:35:42.248]  You know, a tweet they put on the list of unsafe countries, even though the UK has more coronavirus cases than Spain.
[02:35:42.889 --> 02:35:52.457]  So I've got to submit to a potential home visit from the scientific dictatorship when I get back to check that I'm squirreled away in my own home.
[02:35:52.738 --> 02:35:56.501]  You're not even allowed to go out and buy groceries under this quarantine law.
[02:35:57.321 --> 02:35:59.862]  You have to get somebody else to do it, or you have to get them delivered.
[02:36:00.162 --> 02:36:02.963]  You're not even allowed to go out and exercise for two weeks.
[02:36:02.983 --> 02:36:06.405]  You're a literal house prisoner within your own home for two weeks.
[02:36:07.165 --> 02:36:19.710]  I mean, it wouldn't surprise me at this point if we start following the example of Singapore, who yesterday announced that they would be putting tracker bracelets on people as if they were prisoners when they came into the country.
[02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:20.831]  That's the next step.
[02:36:21.571 --> 02:36:26.473]  But a story out of the UK, so all these people from within the UK, because they're so terrified of going abroad,
[02:36:27.389 --> 02:36:29.030]  They're having staycations.
[02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:50.742]  People from London and other major cities are going out to the countryside areas, to the seaside areas, and much of the population, the resident population in those tourist areas, are so panicked at this influx of tourists, which is not massive by the way, it's probably slightly above normal standards, but they're so panicked by seeing this wave of
[02:36:51.539 --> 02:36:53.960]  Potential infected patients heading their way.
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:57.721]  They're literally leaping out of the way in the street.
[02:36:58.401 --> 02:37:13.425]  The Independent report asserts that the general consensus amongst residents is abject fear of staycation tourists pouring into the region and infecting them with COVID-19, despite the fact that daily deaths from the virus in the UK have slowed to a trickle.
[02:37:15.226 --> 02:37:20.187]  Complaining that visitors to the region were not properly social distancing, and this is the region of Cornwall,
[02:37:20.538 --> 02:37:22.660]  She's on the south coast of the United Kingdom.
[02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:28.824]  One female resident described physically leaping out of the way of people in sheer terror.
[02:37:30.246 --> 02:37:33.888]  She said, my shielding is paused from today, but I'm too scared to go out.
[02:37:34.909 --> 02:37:39.092]  Tried walking into town a couple of times, but no social distancing at all.
[02:37:39.453 --> 02:37:45.938]  I was constantly doubling back, leaping out of the way and panicking just to keep my distance from the hordes.
[02:37:46.258 --> 02:37:47.299]  It's horrifying.
[02:37:52.031 --> 02:38:02.496]  She's literally indoctrinated herself by so much hysteria over the past five, six months that she's afraid of people walking towards her in the opposite direction.
[02:38:03.097 --> 02:38:08.479]  Even though most of them are now wearing masks anyway, because you can't even go in a shop in the UK without wearing a mask.
[02:38:09.660 --> 02:38:10.821]  Another resident in St.
[02:38:11.041 --> 02:38:19.425]  Ives said she was too scared to go food shopping due to more people visiting supermarkets and had told her children to avoid the main shopping street.
[02:38:19.833 --> 02:38:33.457]  They see a perfect example on screen now of a Karen who is literally waving her walking sticks around in front of her as if she was going to swing a cat to get the appropriate distance and screaming at people to stay away from her.
[02:38:33.897 --> 02:38:36.937]  This is abject mind control on a level I've never seen before.
[02:38:37.398 --> 02:38:46.740]  And if they can get, you know, 80% of people in polls to support this, or at least a lighter version of this, I mean, we got a lot of work to do.
[02:38:47.921 --> 02:38:58.366]  The story illustrates how some have become so hysterical in response to the constant drumbeat of media alarmism surrounding coronavirus, that they are literally terrified of other people coming anywhere near them.
[02:38:58.927 --> 02:39:06.511]  And you've all probably had one of these experiences by now, especially with people wearing masks, who think they can just bowl into you apparently.
[02:39:08.452 --> 02:39:12.134]  As I was in a restaurant, tried to get past a person, politely asked them to move out the way twice.
[02:39:13.134 --> 02:39:16.456]  They didn't listen, so I walked past them,
[02:39:17.315 --> 02:39:19.796]  Didn't even brush past them, and what was the response?
[02:39:20.216 --> 02:39:21.476]  Snarling arrogance.
[02:39:22.277 --> 02:39:24.157]  That's not social distancing!
[02:39:25.658 --> 02:39:27.838]  Meanwhile, people are literally leaping out of the way.
[02:39:28.458 --> 02:39:33.700]  People literally think that 5 million people in the United Kingdom have died from coronavirus.
[02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:34.160]  It's actually 50,000.
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:37.961]  80% plus of whom would have died anyway.
[02:39:38.882 --> 02:39:41.722]  Yes, every death is a tragedy, but you have to consider that.
[02:39:42.923 --> 02:39:43.363]  Meanwhile,
[02:39:44.679 --> 02:39:50.560]  The actual death figures in the UK on average are lower than normal, including coronavirus.
[02:39:51.461 --> 02:39:53.361]  This is out of lockdownsceptics.org.
[02:39:53.841 --> 02:39:56.822]  Deaths below five-year average for six weeks in a row.
[02:39:57.382 --> 02:40:06.184]  Bearing in mind more people in the UK died during the 2017-18 flu season than the whole coronavirus death toll from flu.
[02:40:07.204 --> 02:40:08.805]  Did we lock down our society?
[02:40:09.105 --> 02:40:10.525]  Did we cripple our economy?
[02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:18.604]  Did we grease the skids for this massive mental illness problem that's going to blow back in our faces time and time again?
[02:40:18.624 --> 02:40:20.245]  No, we didn't.
[02:40:20.485 --> 02:40:26.408]  Because as humans we have immune systems and old people unfortunately die.
[02:40:27.129 --> 02:40:28.569]  But now apparently we can't accept that.
[02:40:28.589 --> 02:40:30.931]  We no longer have immune systems and old people don't die.
[02:40:31.751 --> 02:40:40.056]  Today's ONS release, this is the Office of National Statistics in the UK, has deaths from novel coronavirus in England and Wales continuing to fall.
[02:40:40.973 --> 02:40:48.278]  There are a total of 8,891 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week to July 24th.
[02:40:48.298 --> 02:40:53.961]  That's 161 fewer than the five-year average of 9,052.
[02:40:54.661 --> 02:40:59.705]  This is the sixth week in a row that deaths have been below the five-year average.
[02:41:00.605 --> 02:41:04.948]  They're out there in the media hysterically claiming that we're undergoing a second wave.
[02:41:05.328 --> 02:41:08.230]  The government's locking down different cities
[02:41:09.423 --> 02:41:10.323]  From time to time.
[02:41:10.723 --> 02:41:13.284]  Places like Blackburn, places in Manchester.
[02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:18.465]  Due to a tiny, almost inconsequential spike in coronavirus cases.
[02:41:18.885 --> 02:41:23.965]  Almost all of which is accounted for because there's more testing of coronavirus.
[02:41:25.326 --> 02:41:27.966]  And yet they're locking us down once again.
[02:41:28.486 --> 02:41:29.986]  The screws are tightening.
[02:41:30.487 --> 02:41:31.707]  The masks are going on.
[02:41:32.347 --> 02:41:36.008]  And we have less average deaths than over a five-year period.
[02:41:37.588 --> 02:41:38.688]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:41:39.730 --> 02:41:55.396]  The success, you have to hand it to the media, they've had great success in absolutely terrorising people over this virus, which in the United Kingdom has killed less people than flu did in the 2017-18 flu season.
[02:41:55.696 --> 02:42:06.620]  Yet we have a population of NPC drooling idiots who have swallowed this whole and literally believe that 7% of the population has died from coronavirus.
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:08.881]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:42:09.461 --> 02:42:10.042]  Don't go away.
[02:42:10.182 --> 02:42:11.763]  Summit.News will be right back.
[02:42:11.783 --> 02:42:21.632]  We're going to roll another video here in a second called Why I Wear My Mask, which is a kind of satirical take on all this before I get into some more final news stories.
[02:42:21.672 --> 02:42:32.462]  First, I want to direct your attention to InfoWarsStore.com because yes, it is still necessary, despite the fact that the media apparently now thinks that humans don't have functioning immune systems.
[02:42:33.062 --> 02:42:48.838]  It is still very necessary to keep your immune system strong, which is why we have the Reopen America back-to-school specials up to 60% off and double Patriot points on a whole bunch of excellent products that you know and love.
[02:42:50.039 --> 02:42:52.701]  We have the InfoWars Life Select storable food.
[02:42:53.262 --> 02:42:57.246]  If you don't have at least six months storable food at this point with everything that's going on in the world,
[02:42:57.859 --> 02:42:59.220]  You have to be a little bit insane.
[02:42:59.260 --> 02:43:04.645]  I mean, governments, massive corporations have huge seed vaults and bunkers full of food.
[02:43:05.005 --> 02:43:09.810]  The fact that you wouldn't even have a six-month supply would be absolutely crazy.
[02:43:09.870 --> 02:43:14.374]  We have it at low, low prices and excellent quality at infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:15.435 --> 02:43:19.458]  We also have other great products such as Survival Shield X3.
[02:43:20.499 --> 02:43:22.721]  Again, that's 50% off as part of this special.
[02:43:23.457 --> 02:43:39.786]  The BioTrue Selenium, BODYS, the excellent joint supplement support product, all at massive discounts right now, including BrainForce, the excellent nootropic, 50% off as part of this new sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:40.486 --> 02:43:41.587]  Please support us.
[02:43:41.627 --> 02:43:46.510]  Support your own immune system, because whatever the media says, you do actually need to have a functioning immune system.
[02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:50.972]  So please support us by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:51.738 --> 02:44:02.105]  I'm going to come back and talk about what's happening in Sweden, what's happening in Australia with this lockdown, but first I'm going to go to this short video called Why I Wear My Mask.
[02:44:02.145 --> 02:44:02.645]  Here it is.
[02:44:04.046 --> 02:44:04.166]  Oh!
[02:44:04.786 --> 02:44:05.547]  My apologies.
[02:44:06.755 --> 02:44:10.516]  I was wearing my mask because I just got back from a full day of being a good person.
[02:44:10.756 --> 02:44:14.957]  I love my mask because it's a simple yet effective way to display my righteousness.
[02:44:15.078 --> 02:44:19.619]  Am I concerned that two children in China dropped dead because they were forced to wear masks in gym class?
[02:44:19.719 --> 02:44:19.919]  Nope.
[02:44:20.119 --> 02:44:26.121]  Am I concerned that we're creating a generation of children who will be socially awkward and conditioned to fear their fellow man?
[02:44:26.261 --> 02:44:26.461]  No.
[02:44:26.801 --> 02:44:32.585]  Am I concerned that I'm contributing to an impending socialist technocracy that will enslave the global population?
[02:44:32.645 --> 02:44:33.926]  Not even a little bit!
[02:44:34.006 --> 02:44:42.131]  Am I concerned that my mask is symbolic of my compliance to the social conditioning that will eventually lead to the forced vaccination of every man, woman, and child on planet Earth?
[02:44:42.231 --> 02:44:43.331]  Not a chance!
[02:44:43.511 --> 02:44:45.393]  And why am I not concerned, you ask?
[02:44:45.513 --> 02:44:54.158]  I'm not concerned because I decided a long time ago that shallow, insignificant gestures are a much easier way to showcase my morality than actually being moral.
[02:44:54.258 --> 02:44:58.399]  Because in order to be a real good person, I gotta stand up to a real bad person.
[02:44:58.499 --> 02:45:00.940]  And I don't like standing up to or for anything.
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:07.402]  I've decided that it's much easier to trick my own mind into thinking compliance is a virtue instead of what compliance actually is.
[02:45:07.522 --> 02:45:08.122]  Cowardice!
[02:45:08.282 --> 02:45:14.784]  I prefer to float through life completely ignorant to the fact that every socialist takeover has always begun in the exact same way.
[02:45:14.824 --> 02:45:19.286]  With government overreach, public shaming, censorship, and a toilet paper shortage.
[02:45:19.386 --> 02:45:20.106]  Don't believe me?
[02:45:20.186 --> 02:45:22.627]  Google toilet paper shortage in communist Russia.
[02:45:22.807 --> 02:45:24.967]  Did you think you were having a unique experience?
[02:45:25.167 --> 02:45:32.409]  I prefer to pretend history never repeats itself so that I can stand by and turn a blind eye every time history repeats itself.
[02:45:32.589 --> 02:45:40.190]  I prefer to call anyone who speaks up, fights back, or stands their ground a lunatic or a conspiracy theorist so that I don't feel obligated to do my own research.
[02:45:40.310 --> 02:45:41.930]  Research takes away from me time.
[02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:51.572]  And lastly, I prefer to put on my mask and stand among a sea of masks so that I never have to be seen, be free, or reveal the deep dark shadows that lurk within me.
[02:45:53.530 --> 02:45:55.450]  Or just wear the damn mask.
[02:45:55.510 --> 02:45:56.951]  You hear what they say.
[02:45:57.011 --> 02:45:58.351]  Just take the damn vaccine.
[02:45:58.591 --> 02:46:00.412]  Just take the damn microchip.
[02:46:00.532 --> 02:46:02.452]  Very, very slippery slope, isn't it?
[02:46:02.612 --> 02:46:13.395]  And it's a slippery slope in Melbourne, where they just had another draconian lockdown based again on a spike in cases which could be traced back to one particular incident.
[02:46:14.075 --> 02:46:15.715]  It's not a widespread phenomenon.
[02:46:17.196 --> 02:46:18.176]  And yet in Melbourne,
[02:46:19.053 --> 02:46:24.538]  Hundreds of police were deployed to surround tower blocks to enforce coronavirus lockdown.
[02:46:24.998 --> 02:46:27.740]  And not just police from the images that I saw.
[02:46:28.181 --> 02:46:29.922]  They had National Guard out there.
[02:46:30.462 --> 02:46:39.190]  Within minutes of this government announcement, they had literal police surrounding residential tower blocks to stop people escaping.
[02:46:40.170 --> 02:46:44.354]  Residents of the state of Victoria, in which Melbourne is located, were told
[02:46:45.140 --> 02:46:49.383]  Quote, where you slept last night is where you'll need to stay for the next six weeks.
[02:46:50.224 --> 02:46:58.910]  So bad luck if you were staying in a hotel in Melbourne last week, or earlier this week, because you have to stay there for the next six weeks!
[02:46:59.750 --> 02:47:01.591]  They have a curfew from 8 p.m.
[02:47:01.652 --> 02:47:02.472]  to 5 a.m.
[02:47:03.113 --> 02:47:10.778]  They have fines which have now been increased to $5,000 for flouting any of these new guidelines.
[02:47:11.792 --> 02:47:18.015]  They have police equipped with number plate recognition cameras to catch and fine anyone not complying with the new rules.
[02:47:19.075 --> 02:47:24.457]  And now we have this headline, Melbourne lockdown, police can enter homes without a warrant to carry out spot checks.
[02:47:25.498 --> 02:47:32.801]  And maybe we'll be seeing this in the United States soon, given that we've started to hear noises about enforcing mask wearing indoors.
[02:47:33.761 --> 02:47:39.564]  Police in Melbourne, Australia now have the power to enter people's homes without warrant and perform spot checks to enforce compliance.
[02:47:40.225 --> 02:47:43.267]  With new coronavirus lockdown rules.
[02:47:43.727 --> 02:47:48.650]  They declared a state of disaster in response to a spike in coronavirus cases.
[02:47:49.791 --> 02:47:55.835]  And Premier of the state Daniel Andrews told residents we can no longer have people simply out and about for no good reason whatsoever.
[02:47:56.956 --> 02:48:04.981]  So the police literally now have the power in Australia to come to your house and check that you're in there, check that you're basically under house arrest.
[02:48:05.141 --> 02:48:08.483]  It's basic house arrest situation in Melbourne right now.
[02:48:09.588 --> 02:48:27.073]  Meanwhile, in Sweden, which didn't lock down at all, and which actually trusted its citizens to carry out sensible advice at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, which the media said would be a complete disaster and lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, well, look what happened.
[02:48:27.273 --> 02:48:30.754]  We were right once again, and Newsweek is having to admit it.
[02:48:31.514 --> 02:48:38.816]  With the headline, Sweden, which never had lockdown, sees COVID-19 cases plummet as rest of Europe suffers spike.
[02:48:40.458 --> 02:48:45.039]  Of course, because they had general transmission which built up herd immunity.
[02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:56.363]  Says amid fears over a potential second wave of the novel coronavirus across Europe, new infections in Sweden where full lockdown measures were not implemented have mostly declined since late June.
[02:48:56.863 --> 02:49:02.205]  The number of new cases per 100,000 people in Sweden reported over the last 14 days since July 29,
[02:49:03.757 --> 02:49:11.643]  Dropped by 54% from the figure reported over 14 days prior to then, according to the latest report Wednesday from the WHO.
[02:49:12.223 --> 02:49:31.777]  So no lockdowns in Sweden, no crippling of their economy, no children out of school, or at least very few, which of course ruins their education, makes them ill, unhappy, depressed, makes their parents depressed, really causes drastic harm when you keep children out of school for any length of time.
[02:49:33.689 --> 02:49:34.570]  They didn't do any of that.
[02:49:34.610 --> 02:49:36.471]  They didn't enforce the wearing of masks.
[02:49:36.712 --> 02:49:39.674]  And now they are put in a perfect position.
[02:49:40.935 --> 02:49:43.217]  The rest of Europe apparently suffering a spike.
[02:49:43.277 --> 02:49:44.638]  The actual spike is minimal.
[02:49:45.018 --> 02:49:47.480]  But Sweden's cases are plummeting.
[02:49:47.681 --> 02:49:49.002]  They did not lock down.
[02:49:49.042 --> 02:49:50.423]  We were proven right once again.
[02:49:53.610 --> 02:49:55.430]  Netherlands refuses to mandate masks.
[02:49:55.450 --> 02:49:56.831]  Sweden says they are pointless.
[02:49:56.891 --> 02:49:57.931]  I discussed that earlier.
[02:49:57.971 --> 02:50:02.132]  The top epidemiologist in Sweden says that the masks are completely pointless.
[02:50:02.692 --> 02:50:07.834]  Government of the Netherlands says it's not going to enforce it because it doesn't have any benefit whatsoever.
[02:50:08.414 --> 02:50:21.737]  Meanwhile, in the UK and the US, we have Karens literally walking around screaming, spitting, snarling at people's faces, macing them in the face, throwing coffee over them for not being the good people.
[02:50:22.364 --> 02:50:23.525]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:50:25.427 --> 02:50:30.211]  Shifting topics, Breitbart reports migrant boats shadowed into British waters by French ships.
[02:50:31.392 --> 02:50:37.057]  French ships were seen apparently escorting illegal migrants in small boats across the English Channel again on Tuesday.
[02:50:38.198 --> 02:50:43.502]  We've had 3,000 of these migrants enter into the country this year alone.
[02:50:43.542 --> 02:50:49.828]  Meanwhile, we're being told we have to quarantine and be under house arrest if we come back from holiday in Spain.
[02:50:50.751 --> 02:51:06.439]  But our own government, which supposedly was elected to reduce immigration, is literally providing a taxi service for migrants of unknown origin, unknown documentation, to flood into the country on a daily basis, and nothing is being done about it.
[02:51:06.859 --> 02:51:08.460]  Why is that important?
[02:51:09.941 --> 02:51:19.746]  Well, because in numerous cases, migrants who exploited the refugee wave to get into Europe went on to commit massive terror attacks which killed a bunch of people.
[02:51:21.135 --> 02:51:22.556]  A flashback to this headline.
[02:51:22.616 --> 02:51:29.179]  Navy rescued Manchester bomber Salman Abedi from war-torn Libya three days before deadly terror attack.
[02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:36.742]  This was the guy who literally bombed a pop concert full of children, massacring dozens.
[02:51:37.162 --> 02:51:40.844]  We rescued him by boat from Libya.
[02:51:41.624 --> 02:51:42.905]  This is what happens.
[02:51:44.833 --> 02:51:51.959]  Another headline, seven of the nine jihadis involved in the Paris terror attacks entered Europe through Hungary pretending to be refugees.
[02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:54.521]  Headline out of CNN.
[02:51:55.582 --> 02:51:57.183]  And this was all admitted back in 2016.
[02:51:57.764 --> 02:51:59.165]  They probably wouldn't admit to it now.
[02:51:59.765 --> 02:52:03.388]  Passport linked to terrorists complicates Syrian refugee crisis.
[02:52:03.448 --> 02:52:08.072]  They found a passport used by one of the bombers in Paris.
[02:52:08.873 --> 02:52:10.894]  That horrific attack which killed, what, 200 people?
[02:52:12.976 --> 02:52:15.037]  And it was of a Syrian refugee.
[02:52:15.057 --> 02:52:16.877]  He did a fake tour, stolen a passport.
[02:52:17.297 --> 02:52:21.899]  We're importing these people, our supposedly conservative government, on a daily basis.
[02:52:22.199 --> 02:52:27.340]  Meanwhile, they're telling us we have to quarantine under house arrest if we go on holiday.
[02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:29.741]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[02:52:29.781 --> 02:52:30.961]  Summit.News coming up next.
[02:52:31.101 --> 02:52:32.342]  War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[02:52:32.602 --> 02:52:33.102]  Don't go away.
[02:52:44.591 --> 02:52:49.518]  The first time I used activated charcoal toothpaste was back in 2018.
[02:52:49.558 --> 02:52:53.984]  And I was like, whoa, my mouth is so fresh, so clean.
[02:52:54.024 --> 02:52:55.746]  My teeth are so white.
[02:52:55.806 --> 02:52:57.168]  I've never felt something like this.
[02:52:57.208 --> 02:52:57.749]  What's going on?
[02:52:58.109 --> 02:52:59.411]  It was a major leading brand.
[02:52:59.851 --> 02:53:01.933]  So I brought it to my dad, who's a retired dentist.
[02:53:02.314 --> 02:53:06.598]  He brought it to a big company we use that's produced some other high quality toothpaste that we've sold.
[02:53:06.959 --> 02:53:15.087]  And I said, I want basically to clone this major brand, but I want to take the fillers and things out that experts had told us other dentists.
[02:53:15.307 --> 02:53:15.507]  I think?
[02:53:33.710 --> 02:53:33.810]  Yes.
[02:53:50.865 --> 02:54:04.132]  You will see nine other products that he developed with other top supplement developers, not just the toothpaste, and you'll also find the activated charcoal mouthwash that he's produced, and people that have already gotten it are giving it five star reviews.
[02:54:04.532 --> 02:54:15.078]  We also sell the whole line at InfoWareStore.com, but wherever you get it, it will fund the InfoWare and support us up against globalist attacks to be able to fight these tyrants into the future.
[02:54:15.378 --> 02:54:19.220]  I have been shaped by many things in my lifetime, but the strongest influence has been my father.
[02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:24.621]  He always taught me to be a straight shooter and give people the highest quality in business and you'll be successful.
[02:54:24.921 --> 02:54:25.501]  We've done that.
[02:54:25.561 --> 02:54:26.501]  We've been successful.
[02:54:26.541 --> 02:54:32.903]  That's why we have Dr. Jones Naturals at InfoWarsTore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com as well.
[02:54:33.223 --> 02:54:34.203]  It's all high quality.
[02:54:34.243 --> 02:54:35.103]  It doesn't have fillers.
[02:54:35.383 --> 02:54:36.403]  It doesn't have additives.
[02:54:36.724 --> 02:54:42.405]  It just has ingredients that are known to work and absolutely deliver to you so you're happy and you order again.
[02:54:42.785 --> 02:54:43.685]  InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:55:55.239 --> 02:55:56.099]  New court filings.
[02:55:56.139 --> 02:55:59.461]  Ghislaine Maxwell fled across house during raid.
[02:55:59.641 --> 02:56:01.962]  FBI found tinfoil-wrapped cell phones.
[02:56:02.042 --> 02:56:05.363]  And they found her with a phone she was trying to get rid of, wrapped in tinfoil.
[02:56:05.423 --> 02:56:06.664]  Now, why would she do that?
[02:56:06.684 --> 02:56:09.885]  Because the big genius spy did not have one of these.
[02:56:09.965 --> 02:56:10.746]  And now I'm gonna plug.
[02:56:10.866 --> 02:56:14.327]  This is a Privacy Pocket 1995.
[02:56:15.008 --> 02:56:18.829]  Other people sell these with the copper Faraday cage for 30 bucks.
[02:56:19.209 --> 02:56:19.650]  That's a 200% markup.
[02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:20.370]  This is a 100% markup.
[02:56:23.541 --> 02:56:24.662]  You cannot get a better deal.
[02:56:24.682 --> 02:56:28.365]  These are the best pockets they take from small to large cell phones.
[02:56:28.666 --> 02:56:31.488]  You have them in red, royal blue, green and black.
[02:56:31.668 --> 02:56:44.520]  You put your phone in it and then all the cell towers that every few seconds are pinging where you're at and tracking and getting your data and selling it to the highest bidder and hackers that are busy stealing the data and all the other big corporations have different wireless systems that are stealing your data as well.
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:46.902]  You protect yourself and your data from the
[02:56:47.082 --> 02:56:50.464]  Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clinton Foundation contact tracers.
[02:56:50.504 --> 02:56:59.708]  You protect yourself from all of these people and it is so critical that all of us habituate ourselves and get in the habit now of putting our cell phones, we're not using them, in one of these.
[02:56:59.848 --> 02:57:01.728]  It'll still go in your pocket like it's no big deal.
[02:57:01.808 --> 02:57:03.229]  I fit my cell phone right in here.
[02:57:04.169 --> 02:57:04.890]  I slide it right in.
[02:57:06.834 --> 02:57:07.414]  We're good to go!
[02:57:44.977 --> 02:57:48.378]  Have you tried taking the Real Red Pill?

[02:58:04.804 --> 02:58:10.686]  And low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
