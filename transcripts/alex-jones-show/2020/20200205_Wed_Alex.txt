[00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:02.151]  It is Wednesday, February 5th, 2020.
[00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:05.293]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:06.053 --> 00:00:09.015]  Owen Troyer will be co-hosting via the ATX.
[00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:17.521]  Look at this Newsweek article that right now is the top story on Google and on Apple News.
[00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:29.370]  This is what the establishment has decided to run today with all the huge news, the State of the Union, the out-of-control coronavirus that now evidence is mounting is a
[00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:32.226]  Man-made biological weapon.
[00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:42.937]  Despite all of that, Alex Jones Infowars YouTube videos uploaded by proxy accounts attracted hundreds of thousands of views despite ban.
[00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:50.704]  So they're doing this to act like I'm totally banned everywhere and to create the illusion that anything I say can't be seen anywhere.
[00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:56.611]  No, they said that I was banned off of YouTube two years ago myself from having an account.
[00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:02.257]  But certainly I can go have a press conference at the Capitol and have 50 news cameras there and speak and be heard.
[00:01:02.637 --> 00:01:06.241]  But they're trying to set the precedent with yours truly to say no.
[00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:11.987]  Certain people, no one is allowed to interview, no one is allowed to promote, no one is allowed
[00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:37.734]  To push and again, you'll see these headlines every few days that are pushed on the ticker on Fox News on CNN It'll be some outrageous lie Alex Jones employee Arrested for stalking families never been an employee have nothing to do with them doesn't matter They run that ticker and they talk about it where Alex Jones loses this lawsuit didn't happen That's because they are putting out the idea that we're losers.
[00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:39.274]  We're failures and
[00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:42.375]  And that if you support us, you're a loser and you're a failure.
[00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:44.676]  When our real identity is populism.
[00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:46.196]  Our real identity is nationalism.
[00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:51.578]  Our real identity is real Christianity and free market capitalism and success.
[00:01:51.998 --> 00:01:56.740]  And that we successfully galvanized and energized the grassroots to get Trump elected.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.141]  And that we've turned the tide against the New World Order.
[00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:06.003]  So they have to demonize me and turn me into a pariah by convincing you that I'm a loser and I'm bad.
[00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:08.624]  I know as an audience, you understand that's a fraud.
[00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:20.012]  But if they're able to demonize Infowars and steal our identity and basically sell the idea that we're somebody else, they could win in the end and this model can be used against everybody.
[00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:30.400]  Because once they've shut us down, they can then speak in our voices, say we said things we never said, like saying Trump says all Mexicans are criminals and horrible people.
[00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.163]  I offer a million dollars, no one can find that video.
[00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:34.874]  Same thumb.
[00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:38.858]  I've offered a million dollars for people to find stuff where I said there's Martian slave colonies.
[00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:39.338]  Never said it.
[00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.443]  But this is what they're doing to assassinate people's character.
[00:02:46.394 --> 00:02:52.619]  Coming up in the second hour today, Dr. Francis Boyle, the author of the U.S.
[00:02:52.659 --> 00:03:05.428]  Biological Weapons Convention, will be joining Owen Schroyer live to break down the fact that there's massive evidence and that he says the UN knows, the WHO knows, that this
[00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:09.586]  I think?
[00:03:37.512 --> 00:03:46.153]  In the second hour, but when we come back, I want to get into some of Trump's State of the Union last night and the bizarre behavior of Nancy Pelosi.
[00:03:56.698 --> 00:04:02.002]  We know that 2020 is an insane year already, and it's critical to keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:04:02.262 --> 00:04:17.854]  So when you purchase things like high-quality, storable food you and your family need, and get great products like our Immune Gargle and our silver-infused, nano-silver-infused toothpaste, that's things you need that make you and your family's lives better and safer, and it funds the InfoWars, a 360 win.
[00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:21.877]  So take advantage and get the Immune Gargle and other products before they sell out.
[00:04:21.897 --> 00:04:24.179]  They will be selling out by the end of the week.
[00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:25.980]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.401]  We'll be back.
[00:04:27.722 --> 00:04:29.745]  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
[00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:30.726]  Thank you very much.
[00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:52.927]  A stunning moment here at the end of the president's speech.
[00:04:52.987 --> 00:04:58.689]  Nancy Pelosi tearing up what appeared to be a copy of the president's speech.
[00:05:05.693 --> 00:05:07.394]  It is Wednesday, February 5th, 2020.
[00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:10.235]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:14.357]  Coming up, Owen Schroer will be taking over.
[00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:18.339]  And we also have a very special guest that is going to be joining us.
[00:05:21.118 --> 00:05:21.978]  No, we're good.
[00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:38.046]  This is a big deal.
[00:05:38.086 --> 00:05:39.727]  We don't have major labs saying it.
[00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:45.290]  We have other major organizations coming out and releasing the information that it is engineered.
[00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.692]  And this is just so huge, so huge that this information is being suppressed.
[00:05:50.013 --> 00:05:50.913]  So that's coming up today.
[00:05:51.013 --> 00:06:05.042]  But starting the broadcast here is obviously Nancy Pelosi showing the mental illness, showing the disconnect, showing just how removed from reality their dying political party, the Democrats, are.
[00:06:06.095 --> 00:06:32.272]  She's up there ripping up the speech after Trump is done, wearing a white dress so that she stands out and is the focal point of everything, with all the Democrat women out there in their own little white outfits, trying to create the illusion of solidarity with women against Republicans, when a lot of those women out there are Islamicists who openly believe that women should be genitally mutilated and shouldn't be allowed to drive cars.
[00:06:33.211 --> 00:06:40.696]  It's just crazy to watch the Democrats who tell us that MS-13 are all God's children tell us that, again, they speak for women, they speak for minorities.
[00:06:40.756 --> 00:06:43.218]  It's truly, truly sickening to watch their race baiting.
[00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:52.204]  But let's watch a clip of that one more time of her tearing up the speech right as Trump finishes it.
[00:06:52.404 --> 00:06:56.207]  Because that's the message she's sending is you're never going to get this agenda done.
[00:06:56.227 --> 00:06:57.308]  Thank you.
[00:06:57.588 --> 00:06:58.429]  God bless you.
[00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.870]  And God bless America.
[00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.571]  Thank you very much.
[00:07:10.558 --> 00:07:10.921]  She did.
[00:07:11.707 --> 00:07:11.949]  Wait.
[00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:21.835]  A stunning moment here at the end of the President's speech.
[00:07:21.895 --> 00:07:27.620]  Nancy Pelosi tearing up what appeared to be a copy of the President's speech.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:37.146]  Expanding on this, we also see Pelosi not even clapping when Trump talks about helping children and things like that.
[00:07:37.587 --> 00:07:43.951]  Because they cannot humanize Trump in any way to their supporters who are only in a few
[00:07:45.052 --> 00:07:46.813]  Blue dots in the United States.
[00:08:04.404 --> 00:08:04.965]  Absolutely.
[00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:25.625]  We'll probably never come back.
[00:08:26.146 --> 00:08:27.526]  It's the same thing across the world.
[00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:30.287]  People understand that socialism and communism is horrible.
[00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:42.691]  So the globalists are trying to accelerate their plan and crash the economy ahead of that so they can say that capitalism has failed and then offer us the Venezuelan model, which they will control.
[00:08:43.512 --> 00:08:52.775]  Now, I want to go ahead and end this segment with a clip of President Trump rubbing it in their faces when he gave the Freedom Medal
[00:08:53.715 --> 00:08:54.636]  Is Limbaugh perfect?
[00:08:54.656 --> 00:08:54.716]  No.
[00:09:11.764 --> 00:09:13.145]  He's come a long way.
[00:09:13.505 --> 00:09:15.286]  His show sounds like the Alex Jones Show.
[00:09:15.707 --> 00:09:20.610]  Trump sounds like the Alex Jones Show because we're just promoting real Americana and how the world really works.
[00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.173]  A corporate private world government that's anti-American that believes we are their slaves.
[00:09:25.593 --> 00:09:33.899]  So here is Trump historically giving the Freedom Medal to Rush Limbaugh via the hands of Melania Trump.
[00:09:36.255 --> 00:09:42.380]  Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:54.509]  Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans, who just received a stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:03.386]  This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet.
[00:10:04.206 --> 00:10:10.611]  Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country.
[00:10:38.536 --> 00:11:04.214]  And Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:49.642]  I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor, please.
[00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.557]  Rush and Catherine, congratulations.
[00:13:01.897 --> 00:13:08.978]  Thank you, Catherine.
[00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:19.941]  Ladies and gentlemen, the brevity of that moment, I think, will be missed by the average American.
[00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:25.542]  But for President Trump to award Rush Limbaugh with that
[00:13:27.352 --> 00:13:30.854]  Medal of Freedom last night was so beyond huge.
[00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:46.083]  It was really a break neck point for the Democrat Party and the leftist hate group that currently occupies our country.
[00:13:47.263 --> 00:13:52.667]  And I don't know about you, but last night at that moment, I cried like a little baby.
[00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:54.868]  Because for the president,
[00:13:56.707 --> 00:14:11.775]  To say, be damned to all the leftist haters that are gonna lie about Rush Limbaugh and slander this great moment, and to do that anyway, was just so classy and so impeccable in its timing.
[00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:13.636]  I just can't say enough about it.
[00:14:13.996 --> 00:14:25.763]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's very rare that I am
[00:14:27.324 --> 00:14:28.725]  At a loss for words.
[00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:38.511]  And it's not that I'm at a loss for words because I'm so stunned by the landscape of news.
[00:14:39.792 --> 00:14:46.437]  But honestly, I'm still reeling here today in a good way.
[00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:55.923]  Still in shock and awe in a good way from last night's State of the Union from President Trump.
[00:14:57.423 --> 00:14:58.063]  I laughed.
[00:14:58.823 --> 00:14:59.464]  I cried.
[00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:04.145]  I had moments of feeling inspired.
[00:15:04.165 --> 00:15:07.766]  I had chills.
[00:15:10.767 --> 00:15:14.048]  The hairs on the back of my neck and my arm stood up.
[00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:25.292]  And it was so powerful in such a home run.
[00:15:27.296 --> 00:15:42.124]  That I'm still sitting here today kind of soaking it in, measuring it, measuring my emotions, and seeing how America is responding.
[00:15:44.966 --> 00:15:46.907]  And America has responded.
[00:15:48.067 --> 00:15:54.831]  And it's very telling, even the response we've had in the short term since the State of the Union last night.
[00:15:58.715 --> 00:16:01.516]  Who the people are that have hate in their hearts.
[00:16:04.717 --> 00:16:08.518]  And I could be specific and we can name names and we know who it is.
[00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:15.701]  And we could be specific and point out where that hatred is aimed and where it derives from.
[00:16:15.781 --> 00:16:22.803]  But it's almost a day to forget about that.
[00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:39.298]  It's almost a day to finally just put that hate aside, knowing it's there, but no longer wasting our energy with it, wasting our time with it, being concerned about it.
[00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:52.946]  And it's a time to look at the positive, look at the prosperity, and look at
[00:16:54.502 --> 00:17:05.686]  The significance of what that State of the Union speech meant for the United States of America and for the world.
[00:17:07.307 --> 00:17:09.788]  And I'm not kidding you.
[00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:17.471]  I cried like a little baby when Rush Limbaugh received the Medal of Freedom.
[00:17:19.031 --> 00:17:19.832]  And that's because
[00:17:21.204 --> 00:17:50.115]  Yes, not only is Rush Limbaugh a major influence and inspiration for me, not only has Rush Limbaugh been a true American hero with all the lives that he's touched and his courageous endeavors and trailblazing in media, but more than anything, the class of President Donald Trump to just say,
[00:17:52.185 --> 00:17:58.426]  I'm gonna do what's right here, even though I know there's going to be voices telling me not to.
[00:17:58.626 --> 00:18:10.569]  Even though I know there's going to be people trying to slander and smear this beautiful moment and this American icon.
[00:18:12.309 --> 00:18:20.931]  And for President Trump to do that last night and then actually put the award by Melania
[00:18:22.336 --> 00:18:23.496]  On to Rush Limbaugh.
[00:18:25.017 --> 00:18:30.039]  It was a tidal wave of patriotism.
[00:18:30.099 --> 00:18:36.441]  It was a tidal wave of doing what's right, saying haters be damned.
[00:18:43.224 --> 00:18:49.726]  And so with everything happening, really just this week alone, culminated in that moment
[00:18:53.897 --> 00:19:02.300]  It was just a moment for Americans to stand together and again and laugh and cry and toast and celebrate.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:09.322]  And yeah, we saw the outliers pouting and whining and complaining.
[00:19:09.342 --> 00:19:16.824]  And we just ignored them and said, you know what?
[00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:21.546]  If you don't want to be a part of this, that's on you.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:38.403]  And if you're going to live in such a state of hatred and denial and classlessness and dishonesty and disingenuousness, then that's on you.
[00:19:42.364 --> 00:19:51.186]  And for me, I do sometimes get bogged down by that because we cover it here on air and we respond to it.
[00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:53.767]  We point it out and we use it as an example.
[00:19:55.891 --> 00:20:05.699]  Of just the hatred and vitriol and the vile nature of the modern day left and Democrat party, but that's not what that was about.
[00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:15.432]  And for me personally, I have kind of a social gauge, if you will.
[00:20:15.572 --> 00:20:19.474]  You know, friends and family obviously know I'm in media and do commentary.
[00:20:19.514 --> 00:20:33.319]  And so when I have people responding to events or messaging me about events, that kind of gives me an idea of the scale of social interest and the cultural impact of certain events.
[00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:38.941]  And last night was one of those moments where the scales were jumping.
[00:20:40.803 --> 00:20:48.149]  And I have liberal friends that were texting me saying, wow, what a speech from President Trump.
[00:20:50.150 --> 00:21:02.239]  I had neutral friends and family that usually don't understand why I have so much disgust towards Nancy Pelosi and these Democrats messaging me saying, wow, I see it now.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.381]  I see what you've been talking about.
[00:21:06.142 --> 00:21:10.125]  And there's proof that this is happening.
[00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:20.961]  With callers calling into C-SPAN saying, I am just appalled at the behavior of Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats last night.
[00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:40.565]  But again, we're toasting, we're celebrating, we're crying, we're laughing, we're smiling, we're inspiring, we're growing, we're building, we're learning, and we're doing it all together.
[00:21:42.546 --> 00:21:48.910]  And we're just on this day deciding to leave the haters behind.
[00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:52.213]  Leave the losers behind.
[00:21:53.073 --> 00:21:54.774]  They've been extended an olive branch.
[00:21:54.794 --> 00:21:56.155]  They've been extended a hand.
[00:21:57.496 --> 00:22:00.298]  They've been offered to come on board and celebrate with us.
[00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:03.900]  And they're just not interested.
[00:22:05.461 --> 00:22:11.886]  And so this was a major turning point for America last night at this State of the Union address.
[00:22:13.126 --> 00:22:18.649]  And we will move forward and continue to have victories and continue to celebrate America.
[00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:31.496]  And those voices of hate and those voices of deception against America are being drowned out, are being ignored, and being put where they belong in the trash.
[00:22:33.217 --> 00:22:39.180]  Folks, I'm still just at a standstill from last night's State of the Union.
[00:22:41.206 --> 00:22:48.270]  It's kind of like if your team wins a sports championship or like the Chiefs just won the Super Bowl and you're a Chiefs fan.
[00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:56.354]  It's like you're not sitting here talking about last week's game or what's happening in the offseason or, you know, Monday morning quarterbacking.
[00:22:56.794 --> 00:23:02.997]  You're just soaking it in, celebrating, enjoying it, having the feel goods.
[00:23:04.698 --> 00:23:05.938]  And I don't know.
[00:23:05.998 --> 00:23:10.761]  I mean, I got all this news to get to and I got other stuff and I'm going to play these clips, but
[00:23:13.021 --> 00:23:16.763]  I just feel like America just won the Super Bowl.
[00:23:19.324 --> 00:23:28.988]  I just feel like we deserve a day to just really just celebrate and reflect on what we witnessed last night.
[00:23:30.428 --> 00:23:33.490]  And yeah, the losers lost big league, didn't they?
[00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.610]  They lost big time.
[00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.431]  And they're still sulking.
[00:23:39.932 --> 00:23:41.273]  But I mean, can you imagine
[00:23:44.075 --> 00:23:45.977]  Let's use the Super Bowl as an analogy.
[00:23:46.638 --> 00:23:58.127]  Can you imagine if after the 49ers lost the Super Bowl, they decided to start throwing things and throwing tantrums and fighting with people and fans and players and moping around?
[00:23:58.348 --> 00:24:00.149]  Can you imagine if that happened?
[00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:01.991]  That's what the Democrats are today.
[00:24:04.553 --> 00:24:10.018]  And they have such little self-awareness
[00:24:11.462 --> 00:24:22.367]  That they can't even see how ugly they are, they can't even see how their hatred is just oozing out of them, and how turned off and disgusted America is by it.
[00:24:23.987 --> 00:24:32.011]  And, you know, I see this tweet from Rashida Tlaib, who is really one of the most vile, disgusting members of Congress, this pig.
[00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:37.633]  I mean, she should get credit, I mean, it's the first pig to be elected to Congress, but
[00:24:39.542 --> 00:24:41.443]  It really explains everything to me.
[00:24:42.083 --> 00:24:45.324]  She says, I walked out of that speech as if it's all about her.
[00:24:46.504 --> 00:24:49.725]  Forget about the Tuskegee Airmen and his grandchild.
[00:24:50.325 --> 00:24:52.366]  Forget about the kid that gets school choice.
[00:24:52.766 --> 00:24:57.067]  Forget about the cancer patient who's inspired millions of people.
[00:24:57.527 --> 00:24:58.528]  No, it's all about her.
[00:24:59.128 --> 00:25:02.769]  She wanted you to know it's all about her because she is a pig.
[00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:10.294]  And she says, the lies, the bigotry, literally celebrating everyone in America.
[00:25:15.218 --> 00:25:21.284]  And she says, the shameless bragging about taking away food stamps that people depend on living?
[00:25:21.304 --> 00:25:21.344]  No!
[00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:29.065]  That is so out of touch with reality, it just shows you the very makeup of an average Democrat.
[00:25:29.185 --> 00:25:31.206]  They want you dependent.
[00:25:31.626 --> 00:25:34.428]  They celebrate you being desperate and dependent.
[00:25:34.728 --> 00:25:38.410]  They want you poor, and they want you dependent on them.
[00:25:39.931 --> 00:25:40.531]  They're ticked!
[00:25:41.592 --> 00:25:51.458]  They're ticked that President Trump has uplifted this country and this economy and people to such an extent, they don't need the fat of the government.
[00:25:52.694 --> 00:25:58.539]  They don't need to depend on someone else to take care of them.
[00:25:58.919 --> 00:25:59.740]  They're independent.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.981]  They're making a life for themselves.
[00:26:04.023 --> 00:26:05.864]  And the Democrats hate it.
[00:26:07.706 --> 00:26:09.447]  And that was put on display last night.
[00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:20.616]  Total classlessness from the Democrats and just total distinct class to the utmost from President Trump.
[00:26:23.052 --> 00:26:26.133]  And from Americans that support him last night.
[00:26:29.595 --> 00:26:42.241]  But please, Democrats, continue to make it all about you and continue to put your disgust on display.
[00:26:45.402 --> 00:26:46.503]  You are the worst of us.
[00:26:49.004 --> 00:26:51.025]  And we're leaving you in the dust now.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:27:07.471]  And one good barometer of where America stands is the Washington Journal that takes place on C-SPAN every day, where callers can call in and weigh in on topics and current events.
[00:27:08.792 --> 00:27:15.177]  And this morning, on C-SPAN, and by the way, I will also say this before I go to the clip.
[00:27:16.398 --> 00:27:21.762]  I was going through all the different pre-coverage and post-coverage
[00:27:23.328 --> 00:27:28.110]  Of the State of the Union, ABC, CBS, NBC, Washington Post, everything.
[00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:44.416]  And I was delighted, surprised, but very delighted in the fact that the average pundit covering this on all the mainstream news was honest about what happened.
[00:27:44.716 --> 00:27:46.597]  Trump was incredible.
[00:27:47.057 --> 00:27:50.198]  This was a beautiful night for America.
[00:27:52.165 --> 00:28:04.373]  And they were even people you can tell that didn't want to admit it had to admit, wow, Trump knocked this out of the park and for the Democrats to go against this is about so out of touch that even they can't give them credit for it.
[00:28:04.713 --> 00:28:07.175]  Even they can't say that this is a win.
[00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:09.536]  They can't spin it, folks.
[00:28:11.218 --> 00:28:14.039]  And so here is a compilation.
[00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:20.424]  Here is a compilation from C-SPAN today of people responding
[00:28:21.294 --> 00:28:29.802]  To the pathetic, immature, disgusting behavior of Nancy Pelosi last night during the State of the Union.
[00:28:30.862 --> 00:28:35.887]  I've been a Democrat for 70-something years, and what I've seen tonight of the Democrat Party
[00:28:36.992 --> 00:28:38.514]  I am changing my mind.
[00:28:38.614 --> 00:28:43.900]  I mean, I'll probably still be a Democrat, but as far as I'm reluctant for a goddamn Democrat, never again.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.486]  I am a Democrat as well, but no longer will I vote Democrat.
[00:28:48.946 --> 00:28:56.736]  I think it's outrageous that they sat there when all these good things are happening to our country and how much we love our country.
[00:28:57.316 --> 00:28:59.517]  And they looked like they hated our country.
[00:28:59.917 --> 00:29:04.739]  And Nancy Pelosi, the whole time she's sitting up there with a disgusting look on her face.
[00:29:05.219 --> 00:29:06.219]  It's outrageous.
[00:29:06.639 --> 00:29:08.400]  I will never vote Democrat again.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.321]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:29:10.401 --> 00:29:12.361]  And my whole family feels the same way.
[00:29:12.882 --> 00:29:14.802]  My husband, my friends are sitting here.
[00:29:15.383 --> 00:29:16.703]  All former Democrats.
[00:29:16.963 --> 00:29:19.484]  We all voted for Hillary last time.
[00:29:20.144 --> 00:29:24.446]  And therefore, never, ever will we ever vote Democrat again.
[00:29:25.166 --> 00:29:28.508]  You know, it's always portrayed that the Democrats don't love their country.
[00:29:28.828 --> 00:29:31.429]  Well, we love our country, and we want to see it succeed.
[00:29:31.869 --> 00:29:38.192]  But it appears to us that our Democratic Party has been stolen from us by a bunch of communists.
[00:29:39.233 --> 00:29:43.635]  And no longer will our family ever vote Democrat again.
[00:29:43.655 --> 00:29:51.719]  I am literally disgusted with Pelosi and the Democrats' behavior, the way she teared up his speech behind him.
[00:29:52.589 --> 00:29:56.230]  At the end, I was a registered Democrat.
[00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.331]  I've gone independent.
[00:29:57.351 --> 00:29:58.831]  I'm leaning GOP now.
[00:29:59.091 --> 00:30:08.775]  With a simple rip of a paper, Nancy Pelosi has pretty much sealed the deal of a re-election of Donald Trump.
[00:30:10.015 --> 00:30:13.196]  Ladies and gentlemen, it was happening all last night in response.
[00:30:13.416 --> 00:30:15.857]  It was happening all this morning in response.
[00:30:16.678 --> 00:30:17.458]  And like I said,
[00:30:18.672 --> 00:30:24.356]  I kind of get a gauge on things just based on friends and family that respond to me and send me messages.
[00:30:24.916 --> 00:30:37.864]  And it was just overwhelming disgust towards Nancy Pelosi and overwhelming joy in the speech from Donald Trump.
[00:30:38.065 --> 00:30:39.806]  And I'm talking about liberal friends.
[00:30:39.866 --> 00:30:41.667]  I'm talking about neutral family members.
[00:30:42.027 --> 00:30:44.489]  I'm talking about people that normally say, hey, you know.
[00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:47.759]  I don't really understand why you don't like these people so much.
[00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:52.020]  Hey, I don't understand why you're so extreme in your rhetoric against these people.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.641]  Not apologizing for me, but basically saying, wow, I see it now.
[00:30:58.341 --> 00:30:59.762]  I understand it now.
[00:31:02.602 --> 00:31:04.383]  And you know what the incredible thing is?
[00:31:06.363 --> 00:31:09.384]  Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are only gonna get worse.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.840]  They have no self-awareness.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.281]  They are totally out of touch with reality.
[00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:21.282]  They're so arrogant and selfish in their nature that they're only gonna get worse, folks.
[00:31:23.182 --> 00:31:25.703]  And for them to make this about them?
[00:31:27.483 --> 00:31:30.064]  For them to think they are bigger than the country?
[00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:35.425]  It's a major turnoff for the average American.
[00:31:37.304 --> 00:31:48.972]  And the only thing at this point that I can see that can be a bigger victory than that speech last night is President Donald Trump getting re-elected with a hundred million votes.
[00:31:50.594 --> 00:31:54.496]  And if the Democrats keep this up, he will be.
[00:31:56.538 --> 00:32:00.301]  And the only thing they can do is cheat, lie, and steal.
[00:32:00.921 --> 00:32:02.122]  That's all they have, folks.
[00:32:02.482 --> 00:32:03.483]  The hatred isn't working.
[00:32:05.643 --> 00:32:07.084]  Alright, I'm going to try to move on here.
[00:32:07.104 --> 00:32:18.870]  I just can't help but just want to soak in as much of that beautiful State of the Union from last night and just all the great moments.
[00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:25.834]  I really just want to play the entire thing, and I may do that after I'm joined by Francis Boyle.
[00:32:25.874 --> 00:32:32.298]  Dr. Francis Boyle, creator of the Bio Weapons Act, is going to be joining me to discuss
[00:32:33.393 --> 00:32:39.834]  His very important groundbreaking take on the Corona virus.
[00:32:41.135 --> 00:32:44.895]  And that is going to be coming up at 1230.
[00:32:45.795 --> 00:32:50.636]  And so perhaps after that, I'll just air the entire State of the Union.
[00:32:52.157 --> 00:32:55.097]  Again, it's like watching your favorite team win the Super Bowl.
[00:32:55.117 --> 00:33:00.398]  It's like watching your favorite team win the World Series or Stanley Cup or National Championship.
[00:33:00.538 --> 00:33:02.859]  You just love to see it.
[00:33:03.837 --> 00:33:26.996]  But I do have some news to get to, and be sure to spread the links far and wide to InfoWars.com and Band.Video for when Professor Dr. Francis Boyle is going to be joining us on the coronavirus and the latest coming out of China and what has been discovered.
[00:33:28.351 --> 00:33:30.932]  of the coronavirus being man-made.
[00:33:31.312 --> 00:33:32.533]  What does that mean?
[00:33:32.613 --> 00:33:33.573]  He'll break it all down.
[00:33:34.093 --> 00:33:43.436]  I haven't even taken the time to plug here today all the great products at InfoWarsStore.com but
[00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:48.401]  You know, you've seen recent headlines attacking us.
[00:33:48.942 --> 00:33:56.848]  You've seen that the left and the corrupt power structure of this country are doing everything to try to keep us off the air.
[00:33:57.749 --> 00:34:12.761]  The good news is they are helpless other than just the means they have of running mainstream media to attack us, running corrupt lawyers to attack us, running social media companies to try to censor us.
[00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:17.576]  They may have control over that, but they don't have control over you.
[00:34:18.737 --> 00:34:35.583]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and buy the supplements, buy the emergency food supplies, buy the air filters, buy the water filters, buy the t-shirts, the hats, and everything in between at InfoWarsStore.com, that's you defeating the corrupt establishment.
[00:34:35.623 --> 00:34:41.725]  That's you defeating the anti-American powers that be.
[00:34:43.018 --> 00:34:56.003]  And that's you, not just keeping InfoWars on air in the face of the attacks against us and the attempts to shut us down, but it's also making us bigger and stronger and more powerful.
[00:34:56.943 --> 00:35:05.847]  And so I can't salute you enough, can't thank you enough, but just remember to go to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:35:08.419 --> 00:35:19.486]  If you already have emergency food or you already have a water filter or an air filter, which I think are just necessities for your home, well, go get the toothpaste.
[00:35:19.566 --> 00:35:21.007]  Everybody brushes their teeth.
[00:35:21.067 --> 00:35:22.208]  Everybody needs toothpaste.
[00:35:22.368 --> 00:35:26.571]  Why not shop with the good guys at Infowarsstore.com?
[00:35:27.451 --> 00:35:28.952]  And you'll love the toothpaste.
[00:35:30.013 --> 00:35:32.735]  The Super Blue toothpaste took
[00:35:34.127 --> 00:35:37.089]  The audience that shops at Infowarsstore.com buys Storm.
[00:35:37.249 --> 00:35:38.350]  Overwhelming support for that.
[00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:42.893]  Then, we outdid ourselves and came out with the Super Silver toothpaste.
[00:35:43.013 --> 00:35:45.114]  Both great products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:35:46.695 --> 00:35:53.339]  And remember, you know, there is the coronavirus, but there's other viruses going around, there's other bugs.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.122]  The only, or the best way,
[00:35:58.015 --> 00:36:08.849]  For you to prevent this and be preemptive and to make sure that should you do fall ill, you have an immune system built up to fight it.
[00:36:10.009 --> 00:36:11.410]  We've got products that do that.
[00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.871]  The Immune Gargle, 50% off.
[00:36:14.271 --> 00:36:20.614]  The Colloidal Silver products infused that we have at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:21.275 --> 00:36:24.516]  This is how you can build up your immune system, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:24.556 --> 00:36:26.758]  Super Silver Immune Gargle is a great way.
[00:36:27.238 --> 00:36:30.580]  That is on sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.081]  We've got the fish oil, the selenium.
[00:36:33.261 --> 00:36:37.623]  I mean, the list of supplements seemingly is never-ending.
[00:36:38.143 --> 00:36:38.884]  All powerful.
[00:36:40.524 --> 00:36:41.645]  All get great reviews.
[00:36:42.285 --> 00:36:43.406]  We open up the phone lines.
[00:36:43.446 --> 00:36:44.186]  People call in.
[00:36:44.226 --> 00:36:49.650]  They can't help but just rave about how much they love the supplements, the t-shirts, the hats.
[00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.472]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:52.832 --> 00:36:55.393]  We thank you for keeping us on air.
[00:36:55.433 --> 00:36:57.735]  We cannot thank you enough.
[00:36:59.361 --> 00:37:08.736]  And there's all kinds of films that we have, too, that get banned everywhere that maybe new audience members aren't aware of that are just so powerful and impactful.
[00:37:09.457 --> 00:37:12.021]  DVDs and books at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.231]  And again, that's what makes everything we do here possible.
[00:37:17.311 --> 00:37:30.675]  Okay, so again, coming up next hour, Francis Boyle, the leading expert on this man-made bioweapon that is the coronavirus, he'll be breaking that down coming up in the next hour.
[00:37:30.695 --> 00:37:42.539]  I'm not sure where I want to go here.
[00:37:47.168 --> 00:38:05.562]  I might as well just stick with the current momentum of the State of the Union last night, which has a backdrop not just with the Democrats embarrassing themselves and putting their hatred and vitriol on display, which is a hatred and vitriol for you.
[00:38:07.813 --> 00:38:16.959]  Last night at the State of the Union, but the backdrop is them rigging the Iowa caucus the night before, which is really incredible.
[00:38:18.299 --> 00:38:22.902]  The Democrats kind of used to do shadow rigging of their elections, kind of a little behind the scenes.
[00:38:22.922 --> 00:38:25.164]  I mean, if you have a watchful eye, you notice it.
[00:38:25.284 --> 00:38:26.104]  It's pretty obvious.
[00:38:26.665 --> 00:38:29.827]  You know, Bernie Sanders got screwed last time around.
[00:38:29.867 --> 00:38:32.368]  The Democrats are always engaged in nefarious activity.
[00:38:32.408 --> 00:38:33.569]  These are high criminals.
[00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:42.463]  But now it's reached a point where they just rig elections and rig caucuses and just rig everything just wide open.
[00:38:42.703 --> 00:38:44.284]  Just right there for you to see.
[00:38:44.845 --> 00:38:47.326]  Just, you know, everybody be damned.
[00:38:47.346 --> 00:38:48.306]  Hey, we're the Democrats.
[00:38:48.346 --> 00:38:49.447]  We lie, cheat and steal.
[00:38:49.687 --> 00:38:50.428]  That's what we do.
[00:38:50.448 --> 00:38:51.588]  You know, take it or leave it.
[00:38:51.628 --> 00:38:52.229]  We hate Trump.
[00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.231]  And this is what they think is going to give them victory.
[00:38:57.351 --> 00:38:58.352]  It's really pathetic.
[00:38:58.412 --> 00:38:59.773]  And in fact, it's so incredible.
[00:39:01.814 --> 00:39:03.875]  First of all, voter turnout way down.
[00:39:05.598 --> 00:39:15.289]  But, I mean, I'm looking at the caucus results finally getting released and they're giving it the victory to Pete Buttigieg even though Bernie Sanders got more votes!
[00:39:16.671 --> 00:39:20.015]  So, I mean, it's like, can you imagine?
[00:39:20.035 --> 00:39:21.437]  It's like the Kansas City Chiefs
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:32.004]  Beat the 49ers 24-20, and then the NFL comes out and says, well, we're gonna give the Niners 7 points and declare the Niners the victors.
[00:39:32.084 --> 00:39:37.847]  It's like, well, they didn't win, they didn't deserve the victory, and they had less points, but okay.
[00:39:39.148 --> 00:39:43.770]  That's basically what the Democrats are doing for Pete Buttigieg, which I really don't understand.
[00:39:46.198 --> 00:39:51.162]  I guess they're just trying to test the waters and see maybe if Buttigieg has a chance to beat Trump.
[00:39:51.723 --> 00:40:05.375]  Unfortunately, what they're learning is, I guess Democrats are homophobic because many people that submitted votes in the caucus for Buttigieg, when they found out he was married to a man, wanted to change their vote.
[00:40:07.941 --> 00:40:11.863]  So they're in all kinds of shambles, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:11.983 --> 00:40:16.786]  And then after last night's display, it just goes downhill from there.
[00:40:16.846 --> 00:40:21.989]  But man, just what an absolute victory last night was.
[00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:26.532]  Just all the highlights, all the positive things.
[00:40:27.733 --> 00:40:34.657]  I mean, President Trump couldn't have done a better job of highlighting all the good things happening in America.
[00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:39.912]  Making sure everybody felt touched, making sure everybody felt included.
[00:40:42.193 --> 00:40:43.893]  Uplifting, inspiring.
[00:40:43.913 --> 00:40:58.839]  And you know, you'd sit there, because the President's done this before in his State of the Union, and you'd sit there and you'd say, if you're writing this speech, you're about to deliver it,
[00:41:01.543 --> 00:41:04.924]  I want everyone in America to feel included.
[00:41:05.724 --> 00:41:09.385]  I want everyone in America to feel inspired and uplifted.
[00:41:10.005 --> 00:41:12.485]  I want everyone in America to feel hope.
[00:41:13.486 --> 00:41:26.828]  I want everyone in America to feel positive energy and take that and use it as momentum to just do great things.
[00:41:32.188 --> 00:41:39.213]  You can just assume at this point, in doing so, you're going to anger Democrats.
[00:41:44.497 --> 00:41:46.398]  And think about how sad that is.
[00:41:48.299 --> 00:41:59.447]  That you could sit here and say, I'm going to give a speech that is going to be universally and objectively inspiring and uplifting.
[00:42:01.687 --> 00:42:12.737]  And I know in doing so, I'm going to anger Democrats in Congress, and this is going to be on display for America to see.
[00:42:14.799 --> 00:42:22.746]  And the sad thing about it is that's how predictable these Democrats have become, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:26.210]  And when you're that filled with hate, it's pretty easy.
[00:42:27.213 --> 00:42:38.157]  You know, I apologize to the listeners today if I am sounding redundant or like I'm stuck in the mud here, but I just, I can't help it, folks.
[00:42:39.097 --> 00:42:43.599]  I mean, why would I not celebrate my team winning the Super Bowl?
[00:42:43.679 --> 00:42:46.220]  Why would I not celebrate America having total victory?
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:52.422]  Why would I not celebrate my family coming together and being inspired and uplifted and all of us?
[00:42:54.743 --> 00:42:55.003]  I mean,
[00:42:56.934 --> 00:42:58.856]  It's just where I stand today.
[00:42:59.036 --> 00:43:01.538]  It's just, that's where my spirit is.
[00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:07.102]  I don't want to get into negativity, even though it's the news.
[00:43:07.142 --> 00:43:08.723]  I mean, I've got all the stories here.
[00:43:08.744 --> 00:43:11.466]  I just can't bring myself to do it.
[00:43:13.067 --> 00:43:17.230]  And I know I need to, because that's my job here, and I'll eventually break through this.
[00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:23.816]  But what I want to do, and I've decided this, I've got a big interview.
[00:43:23.896 --> 00:43:25.297]  I mean, this is like, you know,
[00:43:27.475 --> 00:43:31.776]  It's about as big as it gets right now when it comes to the coronavirus.
[00:43:33.336 --> 00:43:52.301]  Dr. Francis Boyle coming on to talk about the fact this is a man-made bioweapon, what that means, how we know it, and just his take on all of that with his expert opinion as the creator of the Bioweapon Act.
[00:43:53.101 --> 00:43:54.482]  He's going to be joining us in 30 minutes here.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.801]  So that's going to be key.
[00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:04.504]  But what I want to do in the third hour, and who has the fourth hour today, guys?
[00:44:06.585 --> 00:44:08.506]  Mike Adams, and he may want to do this as well.
[00:44:08.526 --> 00:44:09.647]  I won't speak for Mike.
[00:44:10.287 --> 00:44:15.290]  But in the third hour after Dr. Boyle leaves us, I'm going to open up the phone lines.
[00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:19.813]  I want to get your response to last night's State of the Union and everything.
[00:44:20.053 --> 00:44:22.194]  I want to hear from the audience what you thought about it.
[00:44:24.275 --> 00:44:25.596]  And I mean, again,
[00:44:29.687 --> 00:44:33.548]  I laughed, I cried, I stood up and cheered, you know.
[00:44:34.708 --> 00:44:38.209]  It was just, it was beyond all expectations for me.
[00:44:38.229 --> 00:44:52.092]  And I think that anybody listening to that that's not filled entirely their hearts with hate was inspired, was uplifted, and is celebratory today.
[00:44:53.618 --> 00:44:55.159]  And it really drew a line, did it not?
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.202]  It really drew a demarcation line.
[00:44:58.222 --> 00:45:02.166]  I mean, heck, even, hey, you gotta give credit.
[00:45:02.186 --> 00:45:04.708]  Some of these Democrats stood and cheered like Kyrsten Sinema.
[00:45:05.789 --> 00:45:06.450]  Good for her.
[00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:08.872]  She still has a heart.
[00:45:08.992 --> 00:45:10.153]  She still has a soul.
[00:45:10.233 --> 00:45:12.235]  She's still in touch with humanity.
[00:45:12.275 --> 00:45:13.636]  She's not filled with hate.
[00:45:14.497 --> 00:45:15.538]  She stood and cheered.
[00:45:15.939 --> 00:45:17.200]  She looked proud to do it.
[00:45:18.294 --> 00:45:21.735]  Sitting to her left was Kamala Harris, scowling like a demon.
[00:45:21.976 --> 00:45:25.217]  Sitting to her right was Kristen Gillibrand, wondering, should I stand?
[00:45:25.237 --> 00:45:25.757]  Should I sit?
[00:45:25.897 --> 00:45:26.477]  I don't know!
[00:45:26.497 --> 00:45:29.619]  And she said, damn be the haters!
[00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:31.760]  I'm proud of America!
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.520]  I will stand!
[00:45:37.402 --> 00:45:41.624]  So, just incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:43.625]  Just incredible.
[00:45:44.685 --> 00:45:46.366]  There is other news to get to, though.
[00:45:47.372 --> 00:46:00.580]  And so I really need to just break through this kind of celebratory mood I'm in, this spirit that's overwhelming me, and I'm going to do it in the next segment, I promise you.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:09.225]  But just for one last time, I just can't help but say, this is just a tremendous victory for America last night.
[00:46:10.245 --> 00:46:13.807]  It was a tremendous victory for President Trump last night.
[00:46:14.288 --> 00:46:16.529]  Not that he intended it to be that way,
[00:46:19.153 --> 00:46:34.401]  But by proxy, the Democrats just could not help themselves but put their hatred and vitriol for this country on display one more time for the national, states, for all to see.
[00:46:34.822 --> 00:46:39.984]  And by the way, I don't know, I haven't seen these numbers or anybody reporting on it.
[00:46:40.124 --> 00:46:40.965]  Maybe somebody has.
[00:46:42.824 --> 00:46:56.787]  But I can just tell you based on the numbers that I saw, because I was actually watching while I was at the gym and I was just on YouTube going through all the different streams, millions of people on YouTube alone tuned in.
[00:46:57.447 --> 00:47:02.568]  So that's not, you know, your cable programs or your television or C-SPAN or anything.
[00:47:02.588 --> 00:47:07.389]  That's just on the internet, which is kind of a new medium for people to consume.
[00:47:08.149 --> 00:47:09.269]  A State of the Union address.
[00:47:09.289 --> 00:47:12.951]  So, I mean, this was maybe the most watched State of the Union of all time.
[00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:17.533]  And, well, folks, you know what people saw, and they're responding to it.
[00:47:17.553 --> 00:47:20.274]  All right, here's what we're going to do, folks.
[00:47:22.755 --> 00:47:27.996]  I'm going to go to some of these highlights here of last night's State of the Union before I move on to the other news.
[00:47:28.097 --> 00:47:29.137]  I just can't help myself.
[00:47:30.763 --> 00:47:32.585]  And so we're going to do that here in just a minute.
[00:47:32.605 --> 00:47:39.871]  But folks, InfoWarsStore.com has the best emergency food supplies at the best price.
[00:47:40.592 --> 00:47:50.641]  And nobody wants to think about the worst happening, whether that's a devastating earthquake or a hurricane or a flood or like what we're seeing in China with the coronavirus.
[00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:54.024]  But should the worst happen, you don't want to be in a pinch.
[00:47:55.245 --> 00:47:58.806]  Where you're trying to figure out, what am I going to do for food to feed my family?
[00:47:59.327 --> 00:48:02.588]  And then you get to the grocery store, you see the long lines.
[00:48:02.648 --> 00:48:05.549]  If you're lucky, you can even get in, but the shelves are empty.
[00:48:06.649 --> 00:48:09.230]  Do not be faced with that situation.
[00:48:09.991 --> 00:48:15.153]  Very affordable, high quality emergency food supplies at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:48:15.293 --> 00:48:17.233]  I cannot emphasize that enough.

[00:49:09.026 --> 00:49:10.366]  It's at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:10.706 --> 00:49:10.966]  Okay.
[00:49:12.372 --> 00:49:14.373]  Let's go to these highlights now.
[00:49:14.893 --> 00:49:20.055]  These are some of the highlights from last night's State of the Union.
[00:49:21.576 --> 00:49:25.337]  Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback.
[00:49:26.277 --> 00:49:29.679]  Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results.
[00:49:31.199 --> 00:49:40.563]  Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging.
[00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:47.394]  And our country is thriving and highly respected again.
[00:49:57.562 --> 00:50:10.632]  In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of Americans' destiny.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.085]  We have totally rejected the downsizing.
[00:50:16.086 --> 00:50:24.357]  We're moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.
[00:50:35.051 --> 00:50:43.796]  Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration.
[00:50:56.983 --> 00:51:00.965]  The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.
[00:51:05.111 --> 00:51:14.927]  And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country.
[00:51:31.127 --> 00:51:42.697]  If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.
[00:51:57.085 --> 00:52:06.047]  The unemployment rate for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels in history.
[00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:24.451]  African-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.
[00:52:28.602 --> 00:52:35.124]  African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.
[00:52:35.144 --> 00:52:46.247]  The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years, and last year women filled 72% of all new jobs added.
[00:53:03.632 --> 00:53:07.634]  The veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low.
[00:53:07.654 --> 00:53:21.562]  The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.
[00:53:34.761 --> 00:53:41.403]  Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S.
[00:53:41.543 --> 00:53:42.063]  history.
[00:53:52.225 --> 00:53:56.526]  A record number of young Americans are now employed.
[00:54:01.224 --> 00:54:07.271]  Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls.
[00:54:07.812 --> 00:54:16.682]  Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.
[00:54:43.502 --> 00:54:50.128]  In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce.
[00:54:50.828 --> 00:54:59.116]  In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people, working-age people, have joined the workforce.
[00:55:12.071 --> 00:55:21.708]  Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%.
[00:55:29.062 --> 00:55:43.232]  After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast, and wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers who have seen a 16% pay increase since my election.
[00:55:58.348 --> 00:56:01.771]  This is a blue-collar boom.
[00:56:11.939 --> 00:56:20.186]  Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start.
[00:56:21.482 --> 00:56:27.566]  This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law.
[00:56:28.507 --> 00:56:50.542]  Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn't be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room... Alright, ladies and gentlemen, some of the highlights there from last night's State of the Union, and you know, kind of an intangible, immeasurable, that was highlighted in my mind last night, is President Trump has pretty much erased the Obama legacy.
[00:56:51.604 --> 00:56:54.105]  Obama's presidency, it's almost like it never happened.
[00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:58.487]  It's really incredible how the legacy of Obama is just gone.
[00:56:58.527 --> 00:56:59.347]  It's like it doesn't exist.
[00:57:00.207 --> 00:57:15.773]  I'm really not sure how to properly... How to properly analyze it or measure it, but... What is Obama's legacy now?
[00:57:20.055 --> 00:57:20.635]  Obama...
[00:57:22.182 --> 00:57:30.904]  Has pretty much just been erased as any form of a significant president at all by Donald Trump.
[00:57:32.304 --> 00:57:33.144]  He's a nothing now.
[00:57:33.564 --> 00:57:35.644]  Obama is a zero president.
[00:57:35.724 --> 00:57:37.445]  It's almost like he never was president.
[00:57:42.085 --> 00:57:50.587]  And I think that this is something that really upsets the left and the Democrat Party, and they know it's true.
[00:57:51.513 --> 00:57:54.955]  Because now even they're being forced to throw Obama under the bus.
[00:57:55.655 --> 00:57:57.796]  Biden is extremely unpopular.
[00:57:58.397 --> 00:58:02.239]  They can't tout any success of the Obama administrations.
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:11.064]  And so the Obama legacy is now basically a nothing burger president.
[00:58:14.025 --> 00:58:18.588]  Or it may get worse for Obama and the Democrats because
[00:58:20.742 --> 00:58:40.656]  Well, if we get justice for the illegal spying and for the basis of the Russian collusion narrative and investigation with the illegal spying, Obama's legacy won't be about what he did for America as president.
[00:58:40.796 --> 00:58:46.060]  It will be as a totally corrupt anti-American criminal who belongs in jail.
[00:58:47.728 --> 00:58:52.752]  And that's really the only chance or shot at a legacy Barack Obama now has.
[00:58:54.934 --> 00:59:05.162]  So Obama either goes down as a forgotten president or he goes down as a criminal traitor against this republic.
[00:59:06.903 --> 00:59:16.871]  And that couldn't have been more eloquently nuanced into that speech last night by President Trump.
[00:59:20.276 --> 00:59:27.162]  Now, coming up in the next segment, I will switch gears and get into the latest in the coronavirus outbreak in China.
[00:59:28.183 --> 00:59:40.573]  And then the expert, Professor Francis Boyle, will be joining me to talk about the evidence that this is a man-made bioweapon and the significance of that and what it means.
[00:59:43.396 --> 00:59:44.517]  That will be coming up next.
[00:59:48.115 --> 00:59:52.618]  Let me just really pile drive through these headlines before we get to that.
[00:59:53.939 --> 00:59:55.260]  Trump at the State of the Union.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:57.322]  The best is yet to come.
[00:59:58.262 --> 01:00:17.456]  Well, if we get another four years of Trump, as far as the economy is concerned and American pride and American exceptionalism is concerned, yes, the current trajectory that we're on
[01:00:18.644 --> 01:00:20.845]  Is only going to go up.
[01:00:22.825 --> 01:00:26.686]  Trump completely ignores Pelosi's handshake attempt during State of the Union.
[01:00:26.746 --> 01:00:35.369]  Now, this happened before the speech was given and how, see, and this is how out of touch and how zero self-awareness Nancy Pelosi has.
[01:00:35.969 --> 01:00:46.892]  She could have actually used that moment and tried to use it against Trump, but because she just couldn't help herself, she ended up being the bad guy and
[01:00:49.031 --> 01:00:52.277]  And Trump even gets a double victory on that deal.
[01:00:53.319 --> 01:00:57.085]  Melania Trump awards Rush Limbaugh a Presidential Medal of Freedom at State of the Union.
[01:00:57.526 --> 01:01:00.872]  Just total class, total victory for America.
[01:01:02.051 --> 01:01:03.131]  I cried like a baby.
[01:01:03.191 --> 01:01:04.472]  The timing is impeccable.
[01:01:05.032 --> 01:01:10.634]  The bravery, the class for that to happen cannot be understated.
[01:01:10.894 --> 01:01:11.214]  Wow.
[01:01:11.374 --> 01:01:12.675]  Congratulations to Rush.
[01:01:12.715 --> 01:01:15.136]  Congratulations to America for that.
[01:01:15.856 --> 01:01:27.500]  And of course, what makes it so powerful to me is the fact that we all knew the left would cry and whine and complain about this, and President Trump did it anyway.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.381]  Because it was the right thing to do.
[01:01:31.882 --> 01:01:35.483]  Pelosi does not applaud as Trump announces scholarship for fourth grade student.
[01:01:35.723 --> 01:01:38.725]  I mean, you can go down the list of the things the Democrats sat for.
[01:01:39.205 --> 01:01:45.288]  Unemployment being low, female unemployment being record lows, just all different.
[01:01:45.328 --> 01:01:51.851]  I mean, every walk of life, American unemployment, record lows, economic booms, people winning.
[01:01:52.995 --> 01:01:56.558]  All inspiring stuff, the Democrats just don't get joy out of that.
[01:01:56.818 --> 01:02:00.700]  They want a nation full of dependent, dilapidated slaves.
[01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:05.944]  That's why they cried when President Trump said, we're getting people off of food stamps.
[01:02:06.044 --> 01:02:08.486]  They literally want people on food stamps, folks.
[01:02:09.306 --> 01:02:09.867]  Really sad.
[01:02:11.147 --> 01:02:15.911]  Pelosi rips up Trump's State of the Union speech at the end for all to see.
[01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:18.369]  I mean, how do you measure that?
[01:02:18.449 --> 01:02:22.751]  Just a woman who's filled with hatred, vitriol, and vodka.
[01:02:23.852 --> 01:02:32.716]  AOC skipped the State of the Union and then did her own little periscope just to once again highlight the arrogance of that clown.
[01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:38.328]  Just the total arrogance, the selfishness, it's all about her, it's all about me.
[01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:41.250]  Trump makes a State of the Union all about America.
[01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:47.053]  The Democrats can't help but make it all about them and their bitterness.
[01:02:47.993 --> 01:02:53.536]  Private payrolls soar in January, the best monthly gain in nearly five years.
[01:02:55.557 --> 01:03:00.360]  Record economic optimism under Trump, better than Reagan, Clinton, and Obama.
[01:03:01.806 --> 01:03:06.450]  Van Jones warns Democrats Trump is helping African Americans in real life.
[01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:07.991]  They don't care!
[01:03:08.011 --> 01:03:13.236]  They want African Americans desperate and poor and needy.
[01:03:14.817 --> 01:03:24.485]  Yes, the Democrats are pissed that black Americans are surging in wealth and prosperity and they don't need government food stamps.
[01:03:25.626 --> 01:03:27.108]  The Democrats hate that.
[01:03:27.208 --> 01:03:29.490]  They want black people underfoot.
[01:03:30.745 --> 01:03:34.051]  That was put on display last night.
[01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:38.097]  And then an interesting story out of the Daily Beast.
[01:03:38.258 --> 01:03:42.204]  Trump had America's top TV news anchors over for lunch and ate them alive.
[01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:43.847]  This was basically like...
[01:03:44.605 --> 01:03:52.430]  You know, the kids get home from school after, you know, getting caught doing a prank or something and daddy had to scold them.
[01:03:53.131 --> 01:03:57.514]  That's basically what this was like, you know, hey, you know, you guys are all fake news.
[01:03:57.554 --> 01:03:58.915]  You're lying about this country.
[01:03:59.115 --> 01:04:00.516]  You're trying to keep morale down.
[01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:01.577]  You're lying about me.
[01:04:02.637 --> 01:04:03.278]  Time to stop it.
[01:04:03.318 --> 01:04:04.098]  It's time to grow up.
[01:04:04.138 --> 01:04:04.979]  It's trying to be real.
[01:04:05.739 --> 01:04:07.461]  Of course, they can't do that.
[01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:08.802]  That's against their
[01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:13.636]  Mode of operation, but, well, you give Trump credit for trying.
[01:04:14.336 --> 01:04:18.999]  By the way, guys, did we ever find out, now, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was not seen last night.
[01:04:19.899 --> 01:04:22.921]  I have not seen anybody talking about this or covering this.
[01:04:24.162 --> 01:04:26.904]  Now, where is Ruth Bader Ginsburg?
[01:04:28.245 --> 01:04:30.366]  What is her current health status?
[01:04:31.207 --> 01:04:33.888]  Why is she even still on the bench?
[01:04:33.988 --> 01:04:35.589]  Well, we know why, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:37.951]  The Democrats are desperate for power.
[01:04:38.695 --> 01:04:56.368]  They'll do anything to maintain their, I don't even know the words for it, their corruption of the Supreme Court, their corruption of justice, their politicization of justice, their liberal activism, posing as a judge.
[01:04:57.088 --> 01:04:59.130]  They can't let that go.
[01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:03.713]  They need Ruth Bader Ginsburg on that bench, even though she can't even walk.
[01:05:04.795 --> 01:05:06.376]  Who knows her current health status.
[01:05:06.837 --> 01:05:18.367]  If there was any integrity left in Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if there was any integrity left on the Democrat side of the aisle, Ruth Bader Ginsburg would have already left the bench gracefully.
[01:05:18.787 --> 01:05:20.008]  But they have no grace.
[01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:22.010]  They have no self-awareness.
[01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:28.175]  All they have is lust for power, lust for deception, and lust for dominating you.
[01:05:29.097 --> 01:05:31.684]  And destroying justice and reality in this country.
[01:05:32.186 --> 01:05:36.539]  The good news is though, as we're celebrating today, America sees through it and they're done with it.
[01:05:37.984 --> 01:05:48.109]  Right now, you're watching the Alex Jones Show live, but I shot this early in the morning, and by the time you're watching this, I should be back in Austin, and I'll be back on air soon, but Owen Schroyer is about to take over.
[01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:51.591]  That said, we had hoped that the coronavirus was just hype.
[01:05:52.291 --> 01:05:53.812]  Now, the evidence isn't mounting.
[01:05:53.852 --> 01:05:56.853]  The evidence is clear that it is an engineered bioweapon.
[01:05:56.873 --> 01:06:00.575]  It came out a week ago that coronavirus contained HIV insertions.
[01:06:01.567 --> 01:06:02.848]  The delivery system of HIV.
[01:06:02.928 --> 01:06:11.254]  Now, new coronavirus in China is treated with HIV med drugs because it is basically the HIV delivery system.
[01:06:11.675 --> 01:06:17.999]  And so, people need to understand, viewers and listeners need to understand, we're not sure exactly how bad this is going to get.
[01:06:18.837 --> 01:06:19.317]  But folks,
[01:06:38.823 --> 01:06:45.071]  Literally shooting people in the streets and locking down whole cities and putting people in prison if they try to get outside the quarantine.
[01:06:45.431 --> 01:06:49.676]  But then when the United States says we're gonna stop flights from China, it's called racist and evil and bad.
[01:06:50.157 --> 01:06:52.720]  That is political correctness at the next level.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.443]  China's shooting their people, but if we just try to stop
[01:06:59.574 --> 01:07:01.155]  What we're fighting here is the U.N.
[01:07:01.255 --> 01:07:01.476]  evil.
[01:07:01.856 --> 01:07:06.580]  Their system is designed to prop up authoritarian states but attack open free societies like America.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:10.223]  Now back to Owen Schroeder and the live broadcast here in the ATX.
[01:07:10.503 --> 01:07:14.286]  And please never forget that InfoWars is brought to you by you.
[01:07:14.647 --> 01:07:17.669]  When you buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com, that funds the operation.
[01:07:17.889 --> 01:07:19.190]  So get the high quality storable food.
[01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.851]  It's selling out.
[01:07:20.091 --> 01:07:24.715]  And so is the immune gargle and other nano silver products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:39.809]  Ladies and gentlemen, the resume of Dr. Francis Boyle speaks for itself.
[01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:44.435]  Member of the Council for Responsible Genetics in the early 80s.
[01:07:44.455 --> 01:07:44.715]  They
[01:07:47.813 --> 01:07:48.653]  We're good to go.
[01:08:12.935 --> 01:08:15.396]  Well, thank you very much, Owen.
[01:08:15.557 --> 01:08:18.919]  I do hope our colleague Jonathan Knight is doing better these days.
[01:08:20.299 --> 01:08:28.924]  Well, we thank the audience for their prayers because that does lift us up when we are feeling ill and he is doing a lot better.
[01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:34.548]  So, Francis, this is really amazing, the headlines that you made on an interview the other day.
[01:08:34.928 --> 01:08:36.309]  The evidence suggests
[01:08:36.969 --> 01:08:44.374]  That this form, this strain of a coronavirus is indeed a man-made bioweapon.
[01:08:44.835 --> 01:08:51.740]  Now, explain to the audience what evidence you've seen that proves that and what that means.
[01:08:54.021 --> 01:08:54.241]  Right.
[01:08:54.341 --> 01:09:04.268]  Well, in my professional activities, I routinely monitor outbreaks of disease
[01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:14.298]  Affecting humans and animals around the world, just to see if there might be a biowarfare agent at work.
[01:09:15.198 --> 01:09:32.053]  So when this coronavirus began to be reported there in China, I began looking into it and researching it, and I won't go through it all here, but eventually it was my considered judgment
[01:09:32.978 --> 01:09:50.428]  That this is a biological warfare agent that had leaked out of the Wuhan biosafety level 4 laboratory that has a previous history of leaks there.
[01:09:51.689 --> 01:10:01.174]  And so BSL-4 laboratories have basically one purpose, and that is to research, develop, test, and stockpile
[01:10:01.869 --> 01:10:04.711]  Biological warfare weapons.
[01:10:04.991 --> 01:10:11.576]  Put aside all the propaganda in support of these things by anyone.
[01:10:12.397 --> 01:10:13.858]  But that's why they're there.
[01:10:13.878 --> 01:10:21.063]  There's no legitimate scientific health reason for BSL-4 laboratories.
[01:10:21.683 --> 01:10:25.606]  So at that point I did put out a notice on the internet
[01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:50.642]  ...saying that I thought it was a biowarfare weapon and it had gain-of-function properties, which meant it was DNA genetically engineered to be more lethal and more infectious than, say, a normal biowarfare agent.
[01:10:52.302 --> 01:11:05.767]  Ever since I gave that interview, which was, I don't know, I guess two weeks ago or so today, all the evidence coming out has confirmed my conclusion.
[01:11:07.207 --> 01:11:11.589]  It does appear this is a DNA genetically engineered chimera.
[01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:20.037]  That it has in it, as you correctly pointed out, the HIV.
[01:11:20.597 --> 01:11:29.463]  Now, I believe the Indian researchers have been pressured to withdraw by their government, because they have good relations with China, that study.
[01:11:29.523 --> 01:11:33.686]  But I read it, and it's quite convincing, and they have the pictures there.
[01:11:34.967 --> 01:11:41.031]  I also believe it has the flu virus in there, and that it also has SARS.
[01:11:42.136 --> 01:11:46.059]  That lab is reported to do SARS work.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:56.065]  So, at a minimum, I think that is what we are facing right now, based on all the evidence I have seen.
[01:11:56.145 --> 01:12:04.411]  Which means, right now there is a lethality rate of 15% of the people infected.
[01:12:05.431 --> 01:12:07.393]  There is an infectious rate of 83%.
[01:12:10.466 --> 01:12:18.994]  Any droplets expelled from a victim can travel at least six feet through the air.
[01:12:19.014 --> 01:12:24.079]  That to me indicates gain-of-function properties.
[01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:29.064]  And there is an incubation period of at least 14 days.
[01:12:30.891 --> 01:12:45.902]  And right now, people infected can be asymptomatic for those 14 days, so you really don't know if they are infected, and they very well could be spreading the disease without any of us knowing about it.
[01:12:46.542 --> 01:12:53.267]  So this is a very dangerous biological warfare agent.
[01:12:53.567 --> 01:12:56.909]  We don't even know the rest of it between you and me, what these
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.366]  I have no idea.
[01:13:03.386 --> 01:13:05.549]  It could be even more dangerous than that.
[01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:06.230]  I don't know.
[01:13:07.351 --> 01:13:13.981]  But it's obvious the Chinese government has been lying about this from the get-go.
[01:13:14.988 --> 01:13:24.151]  The first patient was identified December 1, and he had nothing to do with that market.
[01:13:24.831 --> 01:13:28.833]  And that's just disinformation that people pick this up at the market.
[01:13:28.953 --> 01:13:29.593]  It's baloney.
[01:13:29.653 --> 01:13:35.495]  And then on biowarfare programs they want to cover up, they always blame it on bats.
[01:13:35.575 --> 01:13:38.576]  You know, bats have been around forever, so give me a break.
[01:13:39.036 --> 01:13:42.677]  So I added all this together and I just concluded that
[01:13:43.537 --> 01:13:44.318]  That's what it is.
[01:13:44.478 --> 01:13:50.163]  The Chinese government has been lying about it from the get-go, covering it up, just like they did on SARS.
[01:13:51.004 --> 01:13:52.486]  The WHO is in on it.
[01:13:52.546 --> 01:14:00.653]  You can't believe anything the WHO is telling you, because this is a WHO special designated research lab.
[01:14:01.113 --> 01:14:03.496]  The WHO is up to its eyeballs.
[01:14:04.156 --> 01:14:18.290]  In biological warfare research, and you had the WHO Director Tedros over there meeting President Xi, shaking his hand and yucking it up and saying, oh, China's doing a great job.
[01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:20.152]  Yeah, they're doing a great job covering it up.
[01:14:20.573 --> 01:14:22.535]  So you can't believe the WHO.
[01:14:23.215 --> 01:14:25.816]  And the CDC, well, you can't believe them either.
[01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:42.840]  The CDC has been up to its eyeballs again in dirty biological warfare work, at least going back to the Reagan administration, when the CDC and the American Tide Culture Collection authorized the shipment
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:52.105]  Well, we're going to go to a break here.
[01:14:52.185 --> 01:15:01.030]  We'll get back into these specifics, but I think the obvious reason for the cover-up here would be this is a violation of the Biological Weapons Act.
[01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:03.231]  This is a violation of the Geneva Convention.
[01:15:03.271 --> 01:15:04.832]  This is a crime against humanity.
[01:15:05.432 --> 01:15:06.993]  Dr. Francis Boyle is with us.
[01:15:07.293 --> 01:15:07.994]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:10.396 --> 01:15:31.756]  And my guest is Dr. Francis Boyle, who made headlines the other day after seeing the evidence coming from Indian doctors seeing HIV basically implanted into the coronavirus, as well as evidence of SARS or the flu being put in there as well.
[01:15:33.433 --> 01:15:43.836]  Dr. Boyle, before we get back into the specifics of that, I think just the very concept of a bioweapon is probably shocking to a lot of people.
[01:15:44.196 --> 01:15:50.378]  Many people might not even believe that that kind of thing goes on, but we do know this goes on.
[01:15:50.418 --> 01:15:52.898]  There's labs in China, there's labs in the United States.
[01:15:53.579 --> 01:16:02.001]  Just briefly, talk about biowarfare programs that exist that show, hey, this stuff is very real.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:11.106]  Well, I have an entire book on that called Biowarfare and Terrorism that's pretty cheap and inexpensive.
[01:16:11.146 --> 01:16:14.088]  You can get it at Amazon.
[01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:18.511]  I've been involved in this, I guess, for the... I am only speaking here.
[01:16:18.551 --> 01:16:27.998]  I'm not speaking for the Council for Responsible Genetics, but they asked me to get involved in this as a lawyer for them, I guess, in the early 1980s or
[01:16:30.521 --> 01:16:31.042]  Sometime.
[01:16:31.102 --> 01:16:32.726]  But let me say this.
[01:16:33.648 --> 01:16:41.403]  In all honesty, I don't believe President Trump is getting proper scientific advice.
[01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:48.413]  about how dangerous this really is and that it is an offensive biological warfare weapon.
[01:16:48.914 --> 01:17:00.389]  Basically he has surrounding him all these scientists who have been up to their eyeballs in this dirty work, dirty biological warfare work,
[01:17:01.144 --> 01:17:02.645]  Uh, here in the United States.
[01:17:03.205 --> 01:17:11.451]  So I have no idea what they're telling President Trump, but I suspect they're spinning it to protect their own rear ends here.
[01:17:11.991 --> 01:17:18.916]  In my opinion, every BSL-4 laboratory here in America should be shut down immediately.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:25.181]  And also every BSL-3 laboratory should be shut down immediately.
[01:17:25.682 --> 01:17:42.926]  If you hit the internet, I gave an interview on a documentary called Anthrax Wars, dealing with all these BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities with respect to the United States of America, and I said, this is a catastrophe waiting to happen.
[01:17:43.539 --> 01:17:49.164]  Well, now it has happened in China, and I feel very badly for the Chinese people.
[01:17:49.805 --> 01:17:55.230]  I'm not here to bash China or the Chinese people, the Chinese system of government.
[01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:59.814]  Under international law, they can have whatever system they want over there.
[01:18:00.614 --> 01:18:08.922]  But we're here in America, and we are going to need to take very drastic measures here to protect ourselves.
[01:18:09.668 --> 01:18:14.637]  And I just don't think that President Trump is getting that type of advice.
[01:18:14.677 --> 01:18:23.091]  He has all these swamp preacher scientists around him who I think are trying to sugarcoat it.
[01:18:24.784 --> 01:18:45.071]  Explain to the audience at a rudimentary level what goes on in a bioweapons lab or in this specific BSL-4 lab in China where they take a coronavirus and then as the Indian doctors pointed out with their research, insert HIV or other bugs or viruses into that.
[01:18:45.492 --> 01:18:49.413]  Explain what happens in the lab or why this happens.
[01:18:51.147 --> 01:19:01.533]  Right, well, first thing we have to understand, the United States government, and apparently China, send what I could only call these death scientists.
[01:19:01.633 --> 01:19:04.014]  They like to call themselves life scientists.
[01:19:04.535 --> 01:19:13.640]  But the last time I crunched the numbers in 2015, we had 13,000 death scientists doing this dirty, dangerous biological work.
[01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:25.117]  And they send them out all over the world to find the most exotic and dangerous types of biological organisms they can.
[01:19:25.757 --> 01:19:31.060]  Then they bring them back into their labs and see if they can be weaponized.
[01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:56.541]  One way or the other, with DNA genetic engineering, taking what might be a very dangerous biological organism in the first place, and then adding additional genetic material to it to make it even more dangerous, that it could actually be disseminated as a weapon.
[01:19:57.281 --> 01:19:59.362]  Then, once they have done that,
[01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:18.844]  They reverse engineered the technology to create a vaccine, allegedly a vaccine, because you don't really have a biological weapon unless you have the agent that has been weaponized and then you have a vaccine that can protect your
[01:20:21.546 --> 01:20:35.073]  And so what they do then is say, oh, well, we have to go out and make vaccines for all these potentially dangerous biological organisms out there that we don't even know about.
[01:20:35.613 --> 01:20:44.518]  And they bring them back, DNA genetic engineering, they enhance their lethality, their effectiveness.
[01:20:45.498 --> 01:20:49.600]  And then they reverse-engineer a vaccine.
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:21:09.547]  And this has now been, I would say, turbocharged by so-called synthetic biology with this CRISPR technology where you can go in there and literally pin and excise out a gene and put a new gene in.
[01:21:10.427 --> 01:21:13.088]  The whole synthetic biology field
[01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:20.732]  was financed by the Pentagon and their DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Program Agency.
[01:21:20.952 --> 01:21:29.976]  All of it, the whole synthetic biology field, has been financed by the Pentagon and for biowarfare purposes.
[01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:43.361]  Indeed, the proof of that is that the first big conference of synthetic biologists, they all got together to discuss their technology and they released a report
[01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:44.405]  Which I read.
[01:21:45.097 --> 01:22:00.888]  And in the report, they called for the repeal of my biological weapons anti-terrorism act that had been passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by President Bush Sr.
[01:22:01.368 --> 01:22:01.748]  Why?
[01:22:02.188 --> 01:22:09.513]  Because they fully intended to use synthetic biology to develop biological weapons.
[01:22:10.014 --> 01:22:11.915]  That's what the Pentagon pays for.
[01:22:11.995 --> 01:22:14.477]  You know, the Pentagon's not out there paying for
[01:22:15.477 --> 01:22:17.338]  Objective scientific research.
[01:22:17.378 --> 01:22:21.358]  The Pentagon is paying for war-related research.
[01:22:21.999 --> 01:22:23.419]  And that has been going on.
[01:22:24.879 --> 01:22:42.023]  The use of DNA genetic engineering for biowarfare purposes, at least the start of the Reagan administration, when I got involved, the Council for Responsible Genetics got me involved.
[01:22:43.203 --> 01:22:49.445]  And now we've moved over to this new dimension of synthetic biology.
[01:22:49.865 --> 01:23:04.948]  But even before Reagan, Nixon did sign the Biological Weapons Convention in 1974, but that didn't mean we stopped developing biological weapons.
[01:23:05.988 --> 01:23:09.949]  It was brought underground by the Pentagon and by the CIA.
[01:23:10.939 --> 01:23:13.060]  And this continued underground.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:22.524]  And then the Reagan people and their neocons, and we know the neocons, you know, if you look at that PNAC support,
[01:23:23.469 --> 01:23:34.114]  report, you'll see they advocate biological weapons, ethnic-specific biological weapons as tools of warfare.
[01:23:34.474 --> 01:23:48.000]  So under Reagan, then, they first began to apply DNA genetic engineering to dangerous biological agents before then that were just in nature to make them more dangerous.
[01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.891]  And that's where I came in on the story.
[01:23:51.071 --> 01:23:57.052]  But it's all told in my book there, Biowarfare and Terrorism, and it's inexpensive.
[01:23:57.113 --> 01:23:59.773]  I'm not here, you know, making a lot of royalties off my books.
[01:23:59.793 --> 01:24:12.397]  But it's important information, and in the 90 seconds we have left with you, if you could have President Trump's ear right now, what would you tell him about this coronavirus and how we need to be responding to it?
[01:24:13.869 --> 01:24:18.594]  It's an extremely dangerous biological warfare agent.
[01:24:19.094 --> 01:24:23.119]  We have not seen anything like this before.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:29.205]  You know, you'd have to go back to the Spanish flu virus, I think, between you and me.
[01:24:30.641 --> 01:24:33.743]  And it has to be treated accordingly.
[01:24:34.464 --> 01:24:55.656]  And instead of relying on these swamp creature scientists, he needs to bring in outside independent experts who have never been feeding at the trough of biological warfare programs by the United States government, because they all have a vested interest in this.
[01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:56.296]  As I said,
[01:24:56.949 --> 01:25:08.844]  The last time I crunched the numbers in 2015, you had at least 13,000 of these death scientists doing this Dr. Mengele-type work.
[01:25:09.225 --> 01:25:15.693]  They should all be completely disqualified, and President Trump has the authority to shut down immediately.
[01:25:16.352 --> 01:25:25.499]  Every BSL-4 and BSL-3 laboratory in the United States of America, that should be done right away.
[01:25:25.939 --> 01:25:27.780]  And then more stringent measures.
[01:25:28.501 --> 01:25:34.565]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, here's what I'm going to do for the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:35.846 --> 01:25:43.992]  I'm going to open up the phone lines and I want to hear your response, your take on last night's State of the Union
[01:25:46.633 --> 01:25:48.393]  The number is 877-789-2539.
[01:25:48.413 --> 01:25:49.274]  877-789-2539.
[01:25:49.294 --> 01:25:55.255]  And here's the deal.
[01:25:57.895 --> 01:26:01.836]  I'm going to be taking as many phone calls as I can right here as I'm hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:02.516 --> 01:26:03.937]  I'm doing double duty today.
[01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:11.338]  I'm going to be back hosting the War Room for three hours, which is broadcast live 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:26:11.378 --> 01:26:13.699]  Central at Band.Video.
[01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:18.352]  And I will also take phone calls then.
[01:26:18.952 --> 01:26:28.618]  So if you don't get in today on the Alex Jones Show, whether with me in the next hour or Mike Adams in the fourth hour, I will have phone lines open.
[01:26:28.658 --> 01:26:34.442]  That same number, you can dial in and talk to me during the War Room today as well.
[01:26:35.082 --> 01:26:41.486]  Because, again, to me, America won the Super Bowl last night and
[01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:56.174]  It was really just such a pivotal moment for America, for our culture, for our current political strife and struggle.
[01:26:58.134 --> 01:27:10.598]  And it was such a victory for America that it needs to be reflected on, it needs to be celebrated, it needs to be toasted, it needs to be remembered for what it was.
[01:27:11.724 --> 01:27:17.625]  And so the phone lines are now open 877-789-2539.
[01:27:17.845 --> 01:27:21.786]  Your response to last night's State of the Union.
[01:27:22.187 --> 01:27:26.928]  Now I do have some headlines that I want to get to before we do that.
[01:27:27.268 --> 01:27:30.509]  I also want to thank our last guest, Dr. Francis Boyle.
[01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:34.570]  Very important information he shared with us.
[01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:36.130]  Hope he can come back on.
[01:27:37.425 --> 01:28:04.395]  Later this week with Alex Jones who is going to be back in studio in no time But let me just get some of the headlines here In regards to the coronavirus before we do move on Shocking stuff coming out of China At Infowars.com woman in China shot dead for attempting to break through coronavirus roadblock They are making no
[01:28:06.067 --> 01:28:06.727]  We're good to go.
[01:28:23.735 --> 01:28:34.760]  And more and more the disturbing consensus coming out of reports in China is that this has now been basically turned into, whether this was its original intention or not, is debatable.
[01:28:35.461 --> 01:28:43.505]  It's been turned into an opportunity for the Chinese government to basically arrest people and take people prisoner.
[01:28:44.445 --> 01:28:48.767]  Could it be used for political prisoners as well?
[01:28:49.067 --> 01:28:49.908]  Absolutely.
[01:28:51.053 --> 01:28:58.399]  And they're basically just taking people in, the Chinese communist government that is, and just locking them up, throwing away the key.
[01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:04.464]  Some people are, they're basically having mass cremations of people too.
[01:29:04.484 --> 01:29:11.170]  I mean, it really shows you the desolation of a communist government, but then also,
[01:29:12.779 --> 01:29:14.701]  The seriousness of this outbreak.
[01:29:15.241 --> 01:29:19.845]  Woman wearing face mask attacked in possible coronavirus hate crime.
[01:29:19.865 --> 01:29:21.527]  That's from the New York Post.
[01:29:22.348 --> 01:29:23.128]  New York Post again.
[01:29:23.188 --> 01:29:27.592]  Chinese baby test positive for coronavirus 30 hours after birth.
[01:29:28.673 --> 01:29:35.900]  Daily Star, Wuhan coronavirus cremations working 24-7, burning 100 bodies a day, according to an insider.
[01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:44.187]  And some other headlines, government unveils new electronic tags for people under Wuhan coronavirus home quarantine.
[01:29:45.128 --> 01:29:46.828]  You're basically just locked down.
[01:29:47.368 --> 01:29:54.991]  And if you go out in the streets, you're facing either a Chinese government killing you or, you know, who knows?
[01:29:56.071 --> 01:30:04.234]  Giant flocks of crows and huge mosquitoes invade skies around coronavirus ground zero in China.
[01:30:05.217 --> 01:30:17.527]  Scary stuff happening in China right now with the Corona virus, but when we return from this short break your phone calls on the State of the Union All right, ladies and gentlemen the phone lines are lit up.
[01:30:17.567 --> 01:30:18.768]  We're gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:30:19.228 --> 01:30:33.420]  Let me just Put some wraps on a couple things here before we do that Death counts are allegedly being leaked now out of China, and it's worse than
[01:30:34.795 --> 01:30:35.315]  We think.
[01:30:35.455 --> 01:30:38.617]  Or that original reports were coming out.
[01:30:39.757 --> 01:30:41.198]  Then this story just broke.
[01:30:41.378 --> 01:30:44.299]  Epstein had a mystery bank.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:50.102]  Basically he had his own offshore bank on the Virgin Islands that now is being discovered.
[01:30:50.162 --> 01:30:54.383]  I guess that's where the financier comes into play.
[01:30:55.164 --> 01:30:57.965]  No, this was the most famous
[01:30:59.861 --> 01:31:18.894]  And well-organized industrial sex trafficking network in the world that was implicating royalty around the world, politicians in the United States, celebrities in the United States and beyond.
[01:31:19.134 --> 01:31:27.820]  And meanwhile, Ghislaine Maxwell, number one procurer of women for Epstein, still roams free.
[01:31:29.502 --> 01:31:30.582]  Amazing how that works.
[01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:57.931]  The shadow app that came out as basically, I guess, the app that they used to rig the vote count of the Iowa caucuses a few nights ago, not only was it being operated and set up by former Hillary Clinton campaign members and supporters, the number one funder
[01:31:59.091 --> 01:32:03.614]  Is, you guessed it, George Soros.
[01:32:06.195 --> 01:32:09.497]  George Soros strikes again, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:10.237 --> 01:32:27.727]  And the Iowa caucus rigged job by the Democrats just out in public, combined with the State of the Union last night, combined with what is about to be the vote to acquit Trump, basically marks the death of the Democrat Party.
[01:32:29.782 --> 01:32:31.063]  And they did it to themselves.
[01:32:32.263 --> 01:32:40.308]  And it's ironic, the Democrat Party at the top is scared to death of Bernie Sanders because he is a commie, a radical communist socialist.
[01:32:40.408 --> 01:32:52.094]  But if you look at the future of the Democrat Party, which they're ingratiating themselves to the likes of an AOC or an Ilhan Omar or a Rashida Tlaib, they're radical communists.
[01:32:53.464 --> 01:32:59.908]  So where the Democrat Party goes from here, hopefully it's the likes of the KKK gone for good.
[01:33:00.289 --> 01:33:16.520]  And you know, by the way, I want to point this out because this is so important for people to understand and almost impossible to comprehend because you really have no control over this and we've all been
[01:33:17.617 --> 01:33:28.159]  Conditioned and programmed to trusting search engine optimization, specifically Google, when we're looking for answers to anything.
[01:33:29.759 --> 01:33:46.723]  Google is now essentially rigging reality and it needs to be widely understood that search results on Google are not real, not organic, not legitimate.
[01:33:48.103 --> 01:34:06.707]  And of course, this will be a struggle for current generations and future generations because of the indoctrination of Google into our life, because of the conditioning of, oh, just Google it if you have a question on something.
[01:34:07.307 --> 01:34:11.748]  No, Google's search engine algorithm is rigged specifically
[01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:34.802]  Politically in its nature, rigged to protect communism, protect the Democrat Party in the West, and protect the false narratives propping up those ideologies and those party members and their brainwashed minions.
[01:34:35.842 --> 01:34:40.846]  Where you can't, folks, I really don't know how else to measure this.
[01:34:40.986 --> 01:34:42.347]  I'll just give you an example.
[01:34:43.416 --> 01:34:46.157]  It's well-known history, well-documented history.
[01:34:46.577 --> 01:34:50.318]  The Democrat Party was founded by KKK members.
[01:34:52.179 --> 01:34:55.240]  At the outset of the Democrat Party, it is the KKK.
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:35:10.505]  And in fact, if you look at the first members of Congress that were Republicans, it was freed black men who wanted to fight this political corruption known as the KKK in politics now masquerading around as the Democrat Party.
[01:35:11.646 --> 01:35:12.126]  Google
[01:35:13.243 --> 01:35:16.087]  Has erased that from the memory hole.
[01:35:17.349 --> 01:35:25.260]  And so the average leftist will plug into Google, Democrats start the KKK and Google has revised that history.
[01:35:26.317 --> 01:35:32.959]  And they now use Snopes and Politico and other fake news sites to bury that fact about the Democrat Party.
[01:35:33.179 --> 01:35:38.980]  Because these people run around all day long pointing the finger at everybody saying, oh, you're a racist if you disagree with their ideologies.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.461]  No, they're the racists at every level.
[01:35:42.741 --> 01:35:48.843]  The very foundation of the Democrat Party is based in racism and it's from the KKK.
[01:35:49.203 --> 01:35:52.264]  But now because Google becomes the granddaddy
[01:35:53.470 --> 01:36:00.254]  Of history, people will plug that in and think, oh, it's fake news, even though it's very well documented.
[01:36:01.415 --> 01:36:09.839]  And this is the threat of Google to our history, to our reality, and to future generations of Americans.
[01:36:09.939 --> 01:36:15.243]  It is the single greatest threat of knowledge and information that I can think of right now.
[01:36:15.983 --> 01:36:19.305]  It's evil, it's disgusting, it's despicable, it's criminal.
[01:36:21.417 --> 01:36:28.081]  But you see, because the left is so indoctrined into this, they don't care.
[01:36:29.162 --> 01:36:34.525]  And they will allow it to happen, and they will celebrate revisionist history.
[01:36:35.065 --> 01:36:40.669]  Because that's the only way they can exist, that's the only way they can justify their ideologies.
[01:36:40.909 --> 01:36:42.470]  And it makes me sick.
[01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:50.295]  It makes me sick for future generations of Americans, and humans on Earth, that don't know any better,
[01:36:51.274 --> 01:36:53.055]  That are being deceived by Google.
[01:36:54.737 --> 01:36:56.198]  This is the work of the devil.
[01:36:56.939 --> 01:36:59.120]  Google is now a tool of Satan.
[01:36:59.961 --> 01:37:08.088]  And it, quite frankly, angers me to my core, in my soul, knowing what these people are doing.
[01:37:09.389 --> 01:37:12.831]  They cannot win elections legitimately, so they cheat.
[01:37:14.092 --> 01:37:20.738]  They cannot inspire and inform people legitimately, so they lie and deceive.
[01:37:23.223 --> 01:37:51.833]  And it is so important, it is so important, that at the outset of this, what we're witnessing right now, with the rigged algorithms and fake news search results that Google promotes, we need to market what it is now, so future generations of Americans and world citizens know, Google is lying to you, Google is evil, Google is a tool of the devil.
[01:37:53.706 --> 01:38:05.169]  And communists and socialists and radicals and leftists are going to use the power of Google to deceive humans, to deceive children, to deceive reality.
[01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:08.610]  And it makes me sick.
[01:38:10.971 --> 01:38:16.773]  Meanwhile, on Twitter, they're banning memes.
[01:38:17.933 --> 01:38:19.974]  Yeah, they're banning memes.
[01:38:23.393 --> 01:38:26.155]  The story is at Infowars.com, too effective.
[01:38:26.515 --> 01:38:30.097]  Twitter and YouTube declare war on memes ahead of 2020 election.
[01:38:31.598 --> 01:38:40.602]  And they say, our new rule, this is from Twitter Safety, you may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that is likely to cause harm.
[01:38:41.063 --> 01:38:47.586]  In addition, we may label tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide context.
[01:38:47.927 --> 01:38:51.869]  This is just like Twitter announcing their other new report feature that says,
[01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:53.751]  Oh, we're reporting this.
[01:38:53.791 --> 01:38:56.235]  You can report things for being misleading about a political election.
[01:38:56.255 --> 01:38:59.801]  Now again, this is all aimed at truth and reality.
[01:38:59.841 --> 01:39:01.203]  This is all aimed at you.
[01:39:01.463 --> 01:39:02.966]  This is all aimed at conservatives.
[01:39:03.146 --> 01:39:04.208]  This is all aimed at Trump.
[01:39:05.228 --> 01:39:17.054]  In a real world, should this be applied organically and fairly, this would actually shut down Democrats like Mike Bloomberg running ads of children in cages during the Obama years.
[01:39:17.375 --> 01:39:22.758]  This would shut down all the lies of the Democrats about Trump being a racist and a bigot and everything like that.
[01:39:23.458 --> 01:39:24.979]  But that's not how it's going to be used.
[01:39:25.019 --> 01:39:26.460]  That's not how it's going to be applied.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:34.304]  So more deception, more lies from the tech left, more lies from the Democrats, and then just a total
[01:39:35.779 --> 01:39:36.879]  I don't even know what you would call this.
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:37.720]  Sham!
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:46.463]  A total sham of internet censorship claiming is to protect you when it's to protect their own political interests.
[01:39:46.823 --> 01:39:52.546]  That's why they've now locked James O'Keefe and Project Veritas' account on Twitter.
[01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:53.266]  It's too powerful.
[01:39:53.686 --> 01:39:55.767]  Well, Mitt Romney has just soiled himself.
[01:39:57.253 --> 01:40:01.981]  And made himself a one-term senator voting to convict President Trump.
[01:40:02.001 --> 01:40:03.103]  The vote's happening right now.
[01:40:03.925 --> 01:40:05.648]  We'll see how it all...
[01:40:07.449 --> 01:40:08.029]  We're good to go.
[01:40:30.407 --> 01:40:31.508]  We have so many different options.
[01:40:31.548 --> 01:40:37.473]  You can basically pick and choose what type of food you want in your emergency food supplies.
[01:40:37.894 --> 01:40:39.395]  Very high quality containers.
[01:40:39.836 --> 01:40:40.636]  Easy to store.
[01:40:41.097 --> 01:40:44.400]  Easy instructions on how to prepare as well.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.482]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't get stuck.
[01:40:48.223 --> 01:40:57.133]  In a bad situation after a disaster happens and you try to go to the grocery store to get emergency food and the shelves are empty.
[01:40:57.533 --> 01:40:59.576]  Have that preparation now.
[01:41:00.016 --> 01:41:02.419]  This storable food is good for decades, 25 years to be exact.
[01:41:02.519 --> 01:41:02.619]  And
[01:41:06.741 --> 01:41:12.889]  It's good too if you want to go camping as well and, you know, maybe you don't have to endure an emergency in 25 years.
[01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:16.174]  Well, God bless, but you can still eat it.
[01:41:16.194 --> 01:41:18.477]  You can take it camping and it tastes great.
[01:41:18.757 --> 01:41:22.122]  High quality, storable food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:41:24.142 --> 01:41:32.165]  Okay, let's start going to the phone lines now to get the audience's reaction to last night's State of the Union address.
[01:41:32.285 --> 01:41:34.986]  I considered it a Super Bowl victory for America.
[01:41:35.467 --> 01:41:37.627]  Let's go to Rico in Minnesota.
[01:41:37.687 --> 01:41:38.388]  Go ahead, Rico.
[01:41:40.068 --> 01:41:41.249]  Hey Owen, how you doing?
[01:41:41.689 --> 01:41:42.169]  Good, thank you.
[01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:43.310]  It's good talking to you.
[01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:45.010]  Long time listener.
[01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:49.052]  And as far as the State of the Union, I thought it was absolutely fantastic.
[01:41:49.645 --> 01:41:51.906]  His speeches just keep getting better and better.
[01:41:52.327 --> 01:41:57.250]  The thing that I thought was shameful was the chorus Nancy ripping up the speech.
[01:41:57.470 --> 01:42:00.412]  And I personally don't think that that was a random action.
[01:42:00.452 --> 01:42:02.633]  I believe that that was completely premeditated.
[01:42:02.653 --> 01:42:03.234]  No, no, no.
[01:42:03.854 --> 01:42:04.554]  You're actually 100% right.
[01:42:04.615 --> 01:42:06.416]  I don't know if you realize this or not.
[01:42:06.756 --> 01:42:11.479]  There's actually now new emerging footage before the speech even started.
[01:42:11.539 --> 01:42:13.780]  She practiced ripping it to see if she could.
[01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:16.722]  So yeah, she planned the whole time to do that.
[01:42:17.242 --> 01:42:17.723]  What a bitch.
[01:42:18.553 --> 01:42:28.059]  I believe that she planned to do that, so that would take away from people talking about the message in Trump's speech, talking about what he had to say to make that the focus.
[01:42:28.179 --> 01:42:30.741]  Oh, well, if we could get them to stop... Oh, exactly!
[01:42:30.781 --> 01:42:33.182]  And doesn't that just show you who these people really are?
[01:42:33.202 --> 01:42:38.546]  The most arrogant, self-serving people on Earth, who really think they're more important than America.
[01:42:38.826 --> 01:42:45.272]  They really think they're more important than the average American having a better job, having a better life, having some hope and inspiration.
[01:42:45.673 --> 01:42:46.794]  That's what these people are about.
[01:42:47.154 --> 01:42:48.515]  That's why they're such pigs.
[01:42:49.056 --> 01:42:50.277]  They think it's all about them.
[01:42:50.357 --> 01:42:59.766]  They wanted to steal the energy from America's prosperity, steal the energy from the millions of Americans that feel inspired by a speech like that, and make it all about them.
[01:42:59.947 --> 01:43:01.168]  These are petulant children.
[01:43:02.079 --> 01:43:06.822]  You know, petulant children is exactly the phrase that was used when she ripped it up.
[01:43:06.862 --> 01:43:11.144]  The lady who was sitting next to me, we had a mango meat watch party, you know?
[01:43:11.764 --> 01:43:14.506]  And so we were sitting there and that was the exact word.
[01:43:14.566 --> 01:43:16.347]  She was acting like a petulant child.
[01:43:16.987 --> 01:43:24.351]  And I think Trump's signal on the very last thing he said was, it's only going to get better or the best is yet to come.
[01:43:25.083 --> 01:43:33.053]  I think that was the signal to us as voters, because you had mentioned something a few shows ago, about a week ago, how it was like the 4th of July.
[01:43:33.073 --> 01:43:35.436]  9 o'clock, the fireworks started going off.
[01:43:35.737 --> 01:43:39.021]  9.15, 9.30, it's like, hey, when are the fireworks going to start?
[01:43:39.565 --> 01:43:46.030]  I think that was his message to us, just hold tight folks, those fireworks are going to start coming.
[01:43:46.110 --> 01:43:59.059]  And I'll tell you, when I was referencing that, I was speaking more of, let's start arresting some of these criminals in the government, the James Comeys, the Brennans, the Clappers, but politically last night?
[01:43:59.966 --> 01:44:10.908]  Trump has so much momentum politically after that, and so many people will never vote Democrat again because of the display the Democrats put on last night.
[01:44:10.968 --> 01:44:12.629]  Rico, thank you for the call.
[01:44:12.989 --> 01:44:14.549]  Let's go to Danny in Oregon.
[01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:15.289]  Go ahead, Danny.
[01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:20.030]  Hey Owen, good to talk to you again, man.
[01:44:20.250 --> 01:44:23.851]  So yeah, I was just kind of echoing what the last gentleman said.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:39.564]  At first, I was a little frustrated with the amount of attention people, you know, even on the right side of the aisle, or with any kind of sense, you know, were giving to Nancy Pelosi's stunt, because that's exactly what they wanted.
[01:44:39.604 --> 01:44:51.967]  They wanted to take away from the amazing speech, you know, the guests that they had there, which really just made it the most... I've never cried watching anything political.
[01:44:53.293 --> 01:44:59.198]  And I wasn't crying like a leftist when Hillary Clinton lost, like a baby whining.
[01:44:59.338 --> 01:45:03.762]  It was more, as you said earlier, that, you know, it touched my heart.
[01:45:03.802 --> 01:45:06.044]  It was an emotional thing.
[01:45:06.464 --> 01:45:09.967]  The medal given to Rush after his, you know, cancer diagnosis.
[01:45:10.508 --> 01:45:14.291]  You know, the families of the fallen soldiers and so forth.
[01:45:14.331 --> 01:45:18.034]  You know, it was just an incredible message from the President.
[01:45:20.116 --> 01:45:21.217]  Yeah, and it's not that...
[01:45:22.253 --> 01:45:29.660]  It's not that we highlight the behavior of the Democrats last night to give it any, you know, plausible momentum.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:41.491]  It's just to point out, it's kind of like, again, like I keep using sports analogies, but it's like after the Super Bowl, like a 49ers fan runs on the field and takes a crap, like to try to ruin the game.
[01:45:41.531 --> 01:45:42.912]  Well, that doesn't ruin it for anybody.
[01:45:43.052 --> 01:45:44.894]  It's just, it just makes you look like an idiot.
[01:45:46.124 --> 01:45:46.764]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:47.385 --> 01:45:55.810]  At first I was a little bit frustrated seeing the amount of attention that it received, taking away from the actual speech itself.
[01:45:55.890 --> 01:46:07.897]  But then I noticed today, just looked at Twitter a minute ago, that all of, I would say, maybe 5 out of 10 of the top trending things on hashtags in the US right now are
[01:46:09.038 --> 01:46:16.607]  Well, I'll tell you what, the amazing thing about this is they still won't get it.
[01:46:16.707 --> 01:46:24.357]  They still have no self-awareness, they have no ability to reflect on their own abhorrent behavior, and so they're just going to get worse.
[01:46:24.617 --> 01:46:27.461]  I mean, I can't imagine how poorly
[01:46:28.061 --> 01:46:29.983]  The Democrats are going to start behaving now.
[01:46:30.043 --> 01:46:34.627]  I mean, this is, uh, it's going to be really abhorrent and disgusting, but that's that's who these people are.
[01:46:34.867 --> 01:46:35.788]  Thanks for the call, Danny.
[01:46:35.928 --> 01:46:37.650]  Let's go to Trina in Nebraska.
[01:46:37.690 --> 01:46:38.391]  Go ahead, Trina.
[01:46:39.672 --> 01:46:40.693]  Hey, how you doing, Owen?
[01:46:42.628 --> 01:46:43.229]  Good.
[01:46:43.289 --> 01:46:53.557]  Yeah, so besides her ripping up the speech, the Miss Grant Pelosi also, I don't know if you noticed, but she was like talking to somebody randomly.
[01:46:53.637 --> 01:46:58.361]  I don't know who she was talking to, possibly an imaginary friend, while Trump was giving the speech.
[01:46:58.401 --> 01:46:59.261]  Did you notice that?
[01:46:59.361 --> 01:47:01.323]  Even Mike was like, whoa, what are you doing?
[01:47:01.423 --> 01:47:07.448]  Yeah, I kind of thought she was trying to address, because you know she is kind of a power witch.
[01:47:07.688 --> 01:47:15.755]  So I thought, to me it looked like she was trying to address the Democrats, like telling them to sit or stand, kind of like she's done before when she's gaveling in hearings and stuff.
[01:47:16.295 --> 01:47:19.918]  To me that was her more trying to control the Democrats over there.
[01:47:20.418 --> 01:47:23.361]  But who knows, maybe she was so drunk she just started talking to herself.
[01:47:24.747 --> 01:47:26.048]  Yeah, no, definitely.
[01:47:26.569 --> 01:47:42.883]  And then the second thing about the coronavirus, I guess in Camp Ashland here, we're going to be quarantining, I don't know, about 70 possible people that may be infected or were exposed to the coronavirus, and they're going to quarantine them for 14 days.
[01:47:43.483 --> 01:47:49.829]  And the gentleman that you just had on speaking about how that may not be enough time to notice any symptoms, that's kind of scaring me.
[01:47:52.165 --> 01:48:03.704]  Well, you know, I think that it is obviously scary, and I know that there's other areas that the Pentagon have basically listed as quarantine zones.
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:18.644]  The best thing you can do is just to build up your immune system, obviously take whatever measures, you know, you deem necessary to make sure you're not getting any unwanted germs into your system as well.
[01:48:19.364 --> 01:48:25.966]  But, you know, hopefully this thing stays in China and doesn't have a real outbreak in other countries.
[01:48:25.986 --> 01:48:26.566]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:26.586 --> 01:48:27.106]  We'll be right back.
[01:48:29.275 --> 01:48:32.756]  All right, once again, ladies and gentlemen, we're taking your calls for the rest of this hour.
[01:48:32.816 --> 01:48:34.416]  Mike Adams has the fourth hour.
[01:48:35.117 --> 01:48:36.257]  He may want to take your calls, too.
[01:48:36.297 --> 01:48:37.717]  He may have news he needs to break down.
[01:48:38.157 --> 01:48:50.621]  When I return to host the War Room for three hours from 3 to 6 p.m., I will also be committing the entirety of that broadcast to taking your calls in response to the State of the Union as well.
[01:48:51.321 --> 01:48:57.423]  So without further hesitation, let's go to Woody calling in from Florida on the State of the Union.
[01:48:57.463 --> 01:48:57.983]  Go ahead, Woody.
[01:48:58.971 --> 01:48:59.972]  Hey Owen, how are you doing, sir?
[01:49:00.252 --> 01:49:00.712]  Good, thank you.
[01:49:01.813 --> 01:49:03.534]  Hey, we're definitely going to have to disagree here.
[01:49:06.236 --> 01:49:10.238]  This economy is no better now than what it was under Obama.
[01:49:11.699 --> 01:49:15.942]  I don't see how anyone can even fathom that this economy is even good.
[01:49:16.843 --> 01:49:19.584]  We're still under 23 plus trillion dollar deficit.
[01:49:20.805 --> 01:49:28.230]  Trump is also printing money and giving back to the central banks like Obama was, but when Obama did it was bad, but when Trump does it, it's good.
[01:49:29.794 --> 01:49:32.237]  He's talking about the tax break.
[01:49:32.658 --> 01:49:36.322]  What happened to the Trump that talked about, you know, eliminating the IRS?
[01:49:37.464 --> 01:49:38.745]  We're just talking about tax breaks.
[01:49:41.329 --> 01:49:42.190]  The economy is not good.
[01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:45.934]  The economy is the same one Obama had, Bush had, and Clinton had.
[01:49:46.435 --> 01:49:47.136]  Nothing's changed.
[01:49:50.231 --> 01:49:52.012]  Look, I think you're bringing up fair points.
[01:49:52.472 --> 01:49:54.834]  I don't think it's fair to say nothing's changed.
[01:49:55.875 --> 01:49:56.995]  A lot has changed.
[01:49:57.035 --> 01:49:59.837]  If you have a 401k, it's going gangbusters.
[01:50:00.798 --> 01:50:03.820]  If you're trying to start a business, you have more opportunity.
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:07.682]  If you're an entrepreneur, you have less regulations.
[01:50:08.423 --> 01:50:11.085]  There have been significant tax cuts.
[01:50:11.385 --> 01:50:13.246]  The points you bring up are fair and valid.
[01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:30.347]  Do you not understand the purpose of President Trump celebrating the economy as a winning factor, celebrating the record low unemployment as good things, and using that as kind of
[01:50:31.685 --> 01:50:47.778]  A juxtaposition to all the trajectories it was heading under the past administrations and just the overall message of get used to being poor, get used to the economy going down, get used to America being sucked dry by the rest of the world, that's what you have to deal with.
[01:50:48.758 --> 01:50:50.320]  You don't think that that was significant?
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:55.764]  Well, let's answer that question, or that comment, I should say, methodically.
[01:50:56.965 --> 01:50:58.686]  401K gains are based
[01:50:59.364 --> 01:51:01.327]  On an artificial fiat currency.
[01:51:01.367 --> 01:51:02.188]  It doesn't exist.
[01:51:02.929 --> 01:51:03.669]  Okay, that's one.
[01:51:04.130 --> 01:51:07.534]  Number two is all these, uh, this number's great.
[01:51:07.614 --> 01:51:11.098]  Black Americans, Hispanic Americans and all those numbers.
[01:51:11.439 --> 01:51:16.325]  It's literally the equivalent of me and you going back to college and being able to grade our own papers.
[01:51:19.141 --> 01:51:21.604]  Now again, I'm not disagreeing with your overall point.
[01:51:21.964 --> 01:51:27.290]  The Central Reserve, the fractional banking system, it's all fiat currency, it's all fake.
[01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:28.671]  I'm not disagreeing with that.
[01:51:28.751 --> 01:51:33.116]  Trump has made the debt just as bad, if not worse, than Obama ever did.
[01:51:33.817 --> 01:51:35.579]  But what is your solution to that?
[01:51:37.031 --> 01:51:37.451]  Well, it's not.
[01:51:57.950 --> 01:52:01.532]  I mean, I'm not disagreeing with your points, but the economy is not collapsing.
[01:52:01.572 --> 01:52:05.234]  I mean, people, hundreds of millions of people aren't dying of poverty.
[01:52:06.814 --> 01:52:09.056]  The grocery stores are still filled with food.
[01:52:09.976 --> 01:52:11.597]  People can afford to get them.
[01:52:11.677 --> 01:52:15.299]  So, I mean, again, I'm not disagreeing with your valid points.
[01:52:15.859 --> 01:52:25.344]  I'm simply saying, should those measures be taken, which we can argue good or bad, I'm not saying your points aren't valid, that would collapse the economy.
[01:52:25.604 --> 01:52:29.947]  Most Americans can't even wrap their head around what the fractional reserve banking system is.
[01:52:31.055 --> 01:52:35.901]  Sure, I understand that, and that is a very complicated issue that you raised in that regard.
[01:52:36.181 --> 01:52:38.884]  But right now, we are operating under perceived value.
[01:52:39.164 --> 01:52:45.652]  If people truly understood how broke we were, I guarantee you people would stop buying and get scared, and it would finally collapse.
[01:52:45.752 --> 01:52:46.613]  But we are collapsing.
[01:52:46.693 --> 01:53:03.407]  But there is also, we also need to measure, there is a financial struggle happening right now between the petrodollar and then countries like China and Venezuela and others trying to kill that dollar, which is what props up the American fiat currency.
[01:53:04.148 --> 01:53:13.876]  Well that leads me to another point, Owen, is this puppet president that was installed, Maduro, let me get this straight, I don't agree or like
[01:53:14.344 --> 01:53:19.725]  Chavez is a successor, but the bottom line is that they have their oil and they were throwing it on the market.
[01:53:20.105 --> 01:53:28.687]  They are literally trying to get a globalist puppet in there that will play their game with the dollar and the oil and all that kind of stuff.
[01:53:29.507 --> 01:53:31.848]  And then we got Iran's not on the Central Banking Reserve.
[01:53:32.268 --> 01:53:33.348]  They're getting ready to be invaded.
[01:53:33.608 --> 01:53:35.488]  North Korea, and then you mentioned Cuba.
[01:53:35.689 --> 01:53:41.030]  These are all the last places on Earth that do not have a Federal Reserve dictating their money.
[01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:42.550]  Do you not see the trend?
[01:53:43.795 --> 01:53:45.777]  No, and that's the trend that's been going on for decades.
[01:53:45.817 --> 01:53:47.279]  Again, your points are valid.
[01:53:47.299 --> 01:53:49.021]  I feel that.
[01:53:50.544 --> 01:53:51.945]  And you may disagree.
[01:53:52.205 --> 01:54:09.775]  I just feel that Trump has measured it and he's decided to allow American confidence, consumer confidence, and this fiat currency to continue to bubble because, at least in his presidency, he views it as good for America and, again, the average American won't understand the complex things you're talking about.
[01:54:10.136 --> 01:54:12.817]  He'd rather them understand my 401k just went up 150%.
[01:54:14.458 --> 01:54:16.519]  Good or bad, you make fair points, Woody.
[01:54:16.759 --> 01:54:18.160]  These are trends that have been going on.
[01:54:19.941 --> 01:54:26.945]  I just think that maybe the alternative is a worse option than what's going on right now.
[01:54:27.005 --> 01:54:28.006]  But only time will tell.
[01:54:28.226 --> 01:54:29.046]  Fair points from Woody.
[01:54:29.587 --> 01:54:31.188]  Let's go to Mary in Florida.
[01:54:31.228 --> 01:54:31.908]  Go ahead, Mary.
[01:54:31.928 --> 01:54:34.309]  Hi, Owen!
[01:54:34.810 --> 01:54:35.070]  Hello.
[01:54:36.021 --> 01:54:36.742]  How are you doing?
[01:54:36.942 --> 01:54:38.464]  I'm so happy I got you.
[01:54:38.564 --> 01:54:54.340]  I've been listening to InfoWars since Access Television, and my take on the State of the Union last night, it was excellent, moving, hopeful, everything that I agree with.
[01:54:55.279 --> 01:55:04.805]  What really got me, again, was watching the Democrats sitting there, not moving, making snide faces, laughing.
[01:55:05.145 --> 01:55:12.149]  Oh yeah, you could hear them jeering, and you could hear the disgust in their reaction to certain things.
[01:55:12.209 --> 01:55:15.311]  I mean, it's like, wow, these people are really sick!
[01:55:16.231 --> 01:55:23.816]  Yeah, they are so far gone that they can't see the good in anything.
[01:55:25.086 --> 01:55:30.171]  And at the end, every time there's a State of the Union, they do this.
[01:55:30.831 --> 01:55:32.593]  So that didn't surprise me.
[01:55:32.893 --> 01:55:39.139]  But when Nancy Pelosi tore that speech in half, I just about died.
[01:55:39.159 --> 01:55:41.321]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:55:43.114 --> 01:55:55.377]  Well they've really hurt themselves politically and I just think that their hubris and arrogance and their hatred has blinded them so much now that they can't even see it and really they just don't care.
[01:55:55.397 --> 01:56:01.258]  Yes, and we see this in a microcosm in our daily lives.
[01:56:01.558 --> 01:56:12.081]  When we deal with people like this at work or at school, wherever, they just, they can't see anything good about anything.
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:13.940]  They're just horrible.
[01:56:15.141 --> 01:56:16.562]  I was so mad.
[01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:18.163]  I was still mad this morning.
[01:56:19.563 --> 01:56:21.324]  I couldn't believe she did that.
[01:56:22.105 --> 01:56:28.668]  And you know, Mary, you bring up something else, too, that I think a lot of people can relate to.
[01:56:29.569 --> 01:56:35.592]  And, you know, I remember a time in my life, I think everybody has times in their lives where
[01:56:36.513 --> 01:56:59.583]  You're basically faced with a decision to make internally and spiritually where you're going through a tough time and you're not even sure if you can see a light at the end of the tunnel and it's easy to become overwhelmed with bitterness and anger and it's easy for that to consume you and make you an ugly person and you have to make a conscious decision
[01:57:01.488 --> 01:57:12.953]  In that struggle to not have that bring you down, to not have that to destroy you, to continue to maintain and persevere and keep faith and hope in yourself.
[01:57:13.133 --> 01:57:14.253]  People give it to God.
[01:57:14.453 --> 01:57:15.934]  You know, they look at their family.
[01:57:15.954 --> 01:57:17.895]  There's all kinds of different resources.
[01:57:17.955 --> 01:57:24.297]  But to me, they've just decided to let the bitterness consume them, let the hatred consume them.
[01:57:24.977 --> 01:57:29.379]  And there's just for them, there's just there's no coming back.
[01:57:29.439 --> 01:57:30.160]  I think you said it right.
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:31.120]  There's just no coming back.
[01:57:31.906 --> 01:57:33.807]  No, and it's totally ugly.
[01:57:34.488 --> 01:57:37.329]  And these people, you can see it in them.
[01:57:37.569 --> 01:57:38.330]  They're sick.
[01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:40.831]  Their health, they don't look good.
[01:57:41.011 --> 01:57:41.572]  Yeah.
[01:57:41.892 --> 01:57:43.273]  Well, and that's it too, Mary.
[01:57:43.293 --> 01:57:44.253]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:57:44.293 --> 01:57:44.813]  That's it too.
[01:57:44.994 --> 01:57:50.377]  The average American that is politically neutral is seeing the Democrats and they see monsters, folks.
[01:57:50.417 --> 01:57:51.557]  They see demons.
[01:57:51.597 --> 01:57:52.578]  That's who these people are.
[01:57:54.226 --> 01:57:58.389]  We're trying to take as many of your calls in response to last night's State of the Union address.
[01:57:58.490 --> 01:58:00.511]  Again, I will sign off after the segment.
[01:58:00.551 --> 01:58:09.879]  Mike Adams will take over, but I will continue to take your phone calls for three hours during the War Room today if you don't get in on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:10.379 --> 01:58:12.601]  Let's go out to Robert in Oregon.
[01:58:12.661 --> 01:58:13.442]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:58:14.863 --> 01:58:15.483]  Owen, how you doing?
[01:58:15.824 --> 01:58:16.384]  Good, thank you.
[01:58:17.325 --> 01:58:17.565]  Good.
[01:58:17.705 --> 01:58:19.166]  Hey, just a couple of points.
[01:58:19.527 --> 01:58:21.108]  Same as everybody else, mostly.
[01:58:21.308 --> 01:58:23.350]  You know, I think last night was
[01:58:24.403 --> 01:58:31.049]  More than anything, a big wake-up call for people to take a look at the division and make a choice.
[01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:42.378]  When you look at the reactions of the entire left side from the viewpoint we had of that room, it's disturbing, you know?
[01:58:42.478 --> 01:58:50.905]  I mean, there are certain basic things going on that people need to be cemented and understand.
[01:58:51.505 --> 01:58:53.287]  The choices they make affect
[01:58:54.349 --> 01:58:54.889]  The future.
[01:58:55.089 --> 01:58:59.171]  We have a big, big election coming up and we have a lot of bad things happening.
[01:58:59.611 --> 01:59:07.813]  And, um, you know, people need to keep focused, keep after the truth and decide what they want to do, what they want to back, who they're with.
[01:59:08.273 --> 01:59:10.594]  And, uh, you know, that's, that's pretty much all I have.
[01:59:10.874 --> 01:59:16.256]  I think that people really need to take a look inside themselves and see where they want this country to go.
[01:59:16.276 --> 01:59:22.858]  I mean, to the points, to the guy that made from, I believe Florida regarding the economy and stuff, let's let this president.
[01:59:23.362 --> 01:59:26.264]  You know, have at least one hand untied to work on some things.
[01:59:26.324 --> 01:59:29.286]  He's been battling his own existence for three years.
[01:59:31.087 --> 01:59:45.878]  And again, you know, I couldn't argue with the points he was making, but if you look at the momentum and just the overall attitude, what we had to ingest under Obama versus Trump, it's just a world of difference.
[01:59:47.859 --> 01:59:48.379]  Absolutely.
[01:59:48.739 --> 01:59:50.880]  And, you know, people need to understand that.
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:52.921]  Again, the understanding is a big piece.
[01:59:53.241 --> 02:00:00.345]  You know, it's, you have to put away your Facebook and your Instagram and you have to kind of get focused on some important things.
[02:00:00.425 --> 02:00:07.168]  If you have a family, if you have, you know, a career and a job, you have to put your head down and be a productive member of this country.
[02:00:07.928 --> 02:00:14.771]  And I think that understanding the way things work, we can't bury our heads in the sand and pretend like we don't care or it's too much for us to take.
[02:00:15.651 --> 02:00:16.652]  These are serious things.
[02:00:16.732 --> 02:00:17.092]  And I think
[02:00:17.586 --> 02:00:36.312]  Again, the point that hit me harder than anything last night was how embarrassing it is to see someone who's in their late 60s or 70s, I don't know how old she is, act like somebody who, I mean, to show that, that's, you know, plenty of people tell you, keep control of your emotions, you know, and she can't even do that.
[02:00:36.393 --> 02:00:37.353]  How can we expect her to?
[02:00:37.633 --> 02:00:45.896]  No, it's like, you know, it's like the kid that's like afraid there's a monster under the bed or whatever, and the parent looks under the bed and then actually sees a monster.
[02:00:47.078 --> 02:00:49.620]  And, you know, it's shocking.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:50.920]  Thanks for the call, Robert.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:52.761]  Let's go to Tom in North Carolina.
[02:00:52.821 --> 02:00:53.402]  Go ahead, Tom.
[02:00:55.102 --> 02:00:56.083]  Hey, Alan.
[02:00:56.503 --> 02:00:57.584]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[02:00:59.045 --> 02:00:59.745]  Thanks for calling.
[02:01:00.085 --> 02:01:00.685]  Can you hear me?
[02:01:01.306 --> 02:01:01.446]  Yep.
[02:01:02.326 --> 02:01:05.648]  Yeah, I was going to just comment on the Trump speech.
[02:01:05.668 --> 02:01:07.529]  There's a couple other callers you had.
[02:01:07.569 --> 02:01:12.892]  If I could make a brief comment about the Federal Loan Shark Reserve Board.
[02:01:14.042 --> 02:01:20.345]  What that caller doesn't realize, but I think the banks realize, not many people understand what Lyon Lincoln did.
[02:01:20.365 --> 02:01:33.430]  Right before he invaded unconstitutionally the Confederacy, the sovereign Confederacy, he printed greenbacks because the European bankers wanted to charge him like 30% interest.
[02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:40.813]  So he printed greenbacks and actually, next to the silver certificates that Kennedy printed, that was the last legal money in this country.
[02:01:41.864 --> 02:01:43.164]  Trump's got that in the bag.
[02:01:43.264 --> 02:01:44.605]  I wouldn't worry too much about that.
[02:01:45.985 --> 02:01:53.887]  But as far as that speech went, I think that one caller was right about the most entertaining thing about that speech was just watching Nancy Pelosi.
[02:01:56.587 --> 02:02:01.648]  She looked like a junkie that just had her supply cut off, which is I think what's really happening.
[02:02:01.668 --> 02:02:08.250]  You know, when Trump dropped that mother of all bombs over there on Opium Poppy Central in Afghanistan.
[02:02:09.076 --> 02:02:12.358]  Trying to shut down all these sanctuary drugged-in cities.
[02:02:13.318 --> 02:02:17.880]  But that's how all these democratic machines, I think, are funded, is with that drug money.
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:20.021]  It's like Al Capone had the alcohol.
[02:02:20.281 --> 02:02:23.002]  Oh yeah, the drug money, the human trafficking, absolutely.
[02:02:23.022 --> 02:02:23.002]  110%.
[02:02:23.042 --> 02:02:31.066]  Why else would they be fighting to shut down ICE, who Trump properly gave praise to multiple times last night?
[02:02:31.726 --> 02:02:32.247]  Exactly.
[02:02:32.347 --> 02:02:37.349]  And that's why every time he said something like that, it was like just slapping Pelosi's
[02:02:40.774 --> 02:02:47.339]  It was really just such a moment of vindication, I think, too, for many Americans who have been trying to warn
[02:02:48.786 --> 02:02:49.166]  Hey Owen.
[02:02:49.186 --> 02:02:51.867]  I just wanted to say that your speech was amazing.
[02:03:18.775 --> 02:03:19.936]  It was just crazy.
[02:03:20.136 --> 02:03:26.563]  I was watching it with my mom and we were just looking at Pelosi's face and it literally looked like it was distorted.
[02:03:27.343 --> 02:03:28.965]  She really does look demonic.
[02:03:29.766 --> 02:03:31.688]  Well look, I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.
[02:03:31.748 --> 02:03:35.572]  I don't know what exactly health issues she has.
[02:03:35.632 --> 02:03:36.713]  It's very serious.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:39.601]  She has very serious health problems.
[02:03:39.801 --> 02:03:44.825]  And basically, I'm not kidding you, they literally basically have to tape her nose on her face every day.
[02:03:45.526 --> 02:03:53.673]  And if you can actually see through the inch of makeup she puts on, you'll see there's literal pieces of tape all across her nose.
[02:03:53.693 --> 02:03:55.614]  They have to basically like tape her nose on.
[02:03:55.634 --> 02:04:00.258]  I mean, this woman is very, very ill and disgusting looking.
[02:04:01.039 --> 02:04:05.723]  And again, if these people had any grace or any self-awareness at all,
[02:04:06.483 --> 02:04:09.145]  They would be stepping off the stage.
[02:04:12.868 --> 02:04:13.809]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:13.829 --> 02:04:21.955]  And, um, yeah, she was just, like, pretending to, like, fumble with her papers the whole entire time, like, and pretending, like, she was actually reading it.
[02:04:21.975 --> 02:04:26.098]  And just, like, looking up and her face is just, it just looks so weird.
[02:04:26.178 --> 02:04:30.882]  And it really was so childish when she ripped up the, uh, the speech at the end.
[02:04:30.922 --> 02:04:34.985]  Like, it just shows how, how disconnected and, uh, and evil they are.
[02:04:36.311 --> 02:04:40.354]  Well, I think there's one woman celebrating in the Democrat Party today, and that's Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:40.934 --> 02:04:48.980]  Because Hillary Clinton, I mean, as far as the average American is concerned, is the biggest bitch in American political history.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.022]  I think Nancy Pelosi may have dethroned her last night.
[02:04:52.122 --> 02:04:52.422]  Wow.
[02:04:52.943 --> 02:04:53.563]  Thanks for the call.
[02:04:53.583 --> 02:04:55.344]  Let's go to Hector in Texas.
[02:04:55.424 --> 02:04:56.205]  Go ahead, Hector.
[02:04:57.506 --> 02:04:58.387]  Hey Owen, how you doing?
[02:04:58.667 --> 02:04:59.167]  Good, thank you.
[02:05:00.608 --> 02:05:03.230]  Hey, I wanted to comment about that State of the Union.
[02:05:04.145 --> 02:05:05.946]  Um, I think it's kind of symbolic.
[02:05:06.046 --> 02:05:10.107]  It almost made it seem like people, uh, had to pick a side.
[02:05:11.308 --> 02:05:14.789]  And, uh... I don't know.
[02:05:14.869 --> 02:05:15.389]  It's crazy.
[02:05:15.429 --> 02:05:22.611]  You know, it's crazy to see those people that preach that they have no hate in their heart, and they look evil.
[02:05:22.772 --> 02:05:24.832]  I mean, that lady is a bad lady.
[02:05:25.693 --> 02:05:32.135]  And, uh, I was listening to that guy Woody talk earlier, and, uh, I disagree with him.
[02:05:32.175 --> 02:05:32.655]  I just think...
[02:05:33.157 --> 02:05:39.659]  You know, you have to give people the ability to have a positive outlook on things and, you know, and not be so negative.
[02:05:39.759 --> 02:05:41.099]  I didn't like Trump in the beginning.
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:44.480]  I gave him a chance and I see what he's doing.
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:47.881]  And, you know, I love Trump.
[02:05:47.901 --> 02:05:50.082]  You know, I come across a lot of wealthy people.
[02:05:50.102 --> 02:05:51.222]  I'm an electrician.
[02:05:51.902 --> 02:05:56.643]  And for some reason, they almost act like they're my saviors.
[02:05:56.823 --> 02:06:00.424]  And they automatically assume that I hate Trump because I'm Mexican.
[02:06:01.085 --> 02:06:02.465]  And when I tell them that I love Trump,
[02:06:03.177 --> 02:06:05.118]  They can't understand that.
[02:06:05.238 --> 02:06:06.579]  It's very strange to me.
[02:06:06.599 --> 02:06:17.106]  Well, and that's the intention of all the hate Trump media and the fake news is to try to keep Americans divided, which is another significant victory for the State of the Union speech.
[02:06:17.726 --> 02:06:27.793]  It's a unification of all Americans coming together to love this country, believe in our prosperity, believe in our exceptionalism, believe we can make it to Mars.
[02:06:28.994 --> 02:06:31.515]  And so it's a unifying victory for us.
[02:06:31.535 --> 02:06:32.476]  But you know, it's kind of like this.
[02:06:33.968 --> 02:06:38.510]  It's like, imagine you hate a candy manufacturer so much.
[02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:43.933]  For whatever reason, you just, you hate this candy manufacturer and you just cannot stand it.
[02:06:44.033 --> 02:06:59.561]  And you hate it so much that on a certain day, somebody comes up to you and says, all right, this may be a crude approach to this analogy, but says, okay, you can either eat this candy bar from this candy company, or you can literally eat a piece of human excrement.
[02:06:59.961 --> 02:07:03.523]  And because they hate that candy manufacturer so much, they literally eat,
[02:07:04.676 --> 02:07:07.257]  And that's what the Democrats chose last night.
[02:07:09.898 --> 02:07:16.800]  Yeah, you know, I educate my kids on a lot of this stuff, and I make them watch a lot of political stuff with me.
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:22.722]  Because I tell them, you know, that mentality of, you know, we'll give you something for free if you vote our way.
[02:07:23.202 --> 02:07:24.423]  I tell my kids that doesn't work.
[02:07:24.963 --> 02:07:27.524]  You know, my dad taught me how to work, and it got me through.
[02:07:30.205 --> 02:07:31.505]  Yeah, and that's another thing, too.
[02:07:33.919 --> 02:07:41.865]  People try to sit here and somehow demonize Trump because he talks about the youth being employed and this stuff, but that's a good thing.
[02:07:42.486 --> 02:07:50.993]  It's a good thing for young people to understand work ethic and the value of a dollar and to see the taxes the Democrats take from them.
[02:07:51.273 --> 02:07:52.074]  That is a good thing.
[02:07:52.414 --> 02:07:53.735]  Hector, thank you so much for the call.
[02:07:53.795 --> 02:07:58.079]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I sign off and hand the reins over to Mike Adams.
[02:07:58.199 --> 02:08:00.621]  I will be back in an hour hosting the War Room.
[02:08:00.941 --> 02:08:05.324]  If you don't get in on the Alex Jones Show, call back on the War Room and I'll make sure to take your call.
[02:08:05.985 --> 02:08:08.407]  Mike Adams takes over the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:09.986 --> 02:08:14.651]  All right, Mike Adams stepping in here for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:08:14.771 --> 02:08:15.171]  Welcome.
[02:08:15.512 --> 02:08:18.595]  We are going to be taking your calls today.
[02:08:19.035 --> 02:08:23.500]  However, we want to focus exclusively on the coronavirus pandemic.
[02:08:24.071 --> 02:08:40.257]  I have a lot of new information I'll be breaking this hour on the show, but I'd like you to call in if you have information about this pandemic, what's happening locally or regionally, things that you are seeing, especially if you're a health care worker or a first responder, call us at 877-789-2539.
[02:08:40.277 --> 02:08:40.718]  Again, that's 877-789-2539.
[02:08:40.758 --> 02:08:42.358]  Calls only about the coronavirus pandemic.
[02:08:52.422 --> 02:08:56.629]  I apologize to the callers who were holding about the State of the Union address.
[02:08:57.891 --> 02:09:02.198]  That's not the topic of this hour, even though some great callers last hour.
[02:09:02.238 --> 02:09:07.266]  I really enjoyed listening to Owen and many of the callers and the points raised by the callers as well.
[02:09:07.526 --> 02:09:09.848]  But this hour is going to be the coronavirus pandemic.
[02:09:10.308 --> 02:09:14.651]  We have a lot of very important information breaking now about that.
[02:09:15.072 --> 02:09:21.916]  This morning, Zero Hedge rolled out an article that we have confirmed through our sources in Taiwan.
[02:09:22.337 --> 02:09:23.377]  We published it now.
[02:09:23.638 --> 02:09:33.785]  It seems to suggest that the actual number of infections may be 155,000, according to the Chinese government's own secret statistics.
[02:09:34.508 --> 02:09:39.870]  And that the deaths from this coronavirus pandemic in China alone may be approaching 25,000.
[02:09:41.271 --> 02:09:48.134]  And as we continue the show here today in this hour, I will explain exactly where those possible numbers are coming from.
[02:09:48.794 --> 02:09:51.415]  It seems to be that China has two sets of data.
[02:09:52.056 --> 02:10:01.460]  One set is being recorded privately in their own databases, but then there's a second set of data that's much lower numbers that's being given to the public.
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:02.340]  We will cover that.
[02:10:03.271 --> 02:10:11.156]  Also today, some more highlights from the Francis Boyle interview that Owen Schroyer conducted last hour.
[02:10:11.996 --> 02:10:28.586]  There is a lot of important information from Francis Boyle that we need to get into about the biological weapons program and how it's proceeding in the United States and even how 9-11 was a type of cover in order to relaunch biological weapons development in America.
[02:10:29.907 --> 02:10:30.167]  Also,
[02:10:30.925 --> 02:10:36.708]  As we publish on Natural News today, it appears that the WHO wants the pandemic to succeed.
[02:10:37.208 --> 02:10:38.889]  I'll get into that story today as well.
[02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:46.313]  And what I mean by that is they are actively encouraging all countries to stop blocking flights and passengers from China.
[02:10:47.114 --> 02:10:51.676]  They seem to want, the WHO, seems to want this pandemic to spread.
[02:10:52.797 --> 02:10:55.979]  And today on the show here, I will be talking about why that is.
[02:10:56.059 --> 02:10:58.440]  The big theory here, depopulation.
[02:10:59.173 --> 02:11:06.375]  Why would the World Health Authority be, quote, up to their eyeballs in bioweapons research, according to Francis Boyle?
[02:11:06.916 --> 02:11:09.036]  Why would they want the pandemic to spread?
[02:11:09.637 --> 02:11:14.318]  Why would they not want countries to defend their borders against this outbreak?
[02:11:14.718 --> 02:11:15.939]  We'll get into those reasons.
[02:11:15.979 --> 02:11:19.380]  You may already know some of the answers yourself.
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:22.621]  Also, some of the videos coming out of China
[02:11:23.883 --> 02:11:29.407]  Appear to depict that the payload of this virus is almost acting like a nerve agent.
[02:11:29.767 --> 02:11:42.315]  I'm not saying it is a nerve agent, but the symptoms and the sudden deaths that are occurring among people who are infected appear to be, to have such a sudden rapid onset that it's like they were attacked by a nerve agent.
[02:11:42.716 --> 02:11:48.039]  Some people are going into paralysis and death apparently in less than 60 seconds.
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:51.842]  And this is why people are dying all over the streets and sidewalks.
[02:11:52.555 --> 02:11:55.418]  In China and why those videos are leaking online.
[02:11:56.599 --> 02:12:05.428]  We also have quotes today from an expert that I will be reading an infectious disease expert who says this is going to go global.
[02:12:05.989 --> 02:12:07.911]  This cannot be contained at this point.
[02:12:08.131 --> 02:12:11.535]  It's eventually going to get into every country in the world.
[02:12:12.242 --> 02:12:21.834]  And wouldn't you know it, just as the CDC was sort of celebrating no new infections for a few days, Wisconsin just confirmed the 12th case in the United States.
[02:12:22.375 --> 02:12:30.024]  That's right, the 12th case of confirmed coronavirus infection in Wisconsin today, which brings up a huge assortment of questions.
[02:12:30.344 --> 02:12:31.506]  How did it get to Wisconsin?
[02:12:32.107 --> 02:12:36.233]  And why wasn't it diagnosed earlier and who else has not yet been tested?
[02:12:36.573 --> 02:12:41.060]  We'll cover all these questions plus your calls and more as we continue here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:42.101]  Be back in 60 seconds.
[02:12:44.179 --> 02:12:46.440]  Mike Adams here, continuing the fourth hour.
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:47.500]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.841]  If you're just joining us, this hour will focus entirely on the coronavirus pandemic.
[02:12:52.301 --> 02:12:56.802]  We have new analysis, new information, some of it coming from my staff members.
[02:12:56.862 --> 02:12:58.303]  We have an office in Taiwan.
[02:12:58.683 --> 02:13:01.464]  Many of you know my wife is Taiwanese.
[02:13:01.884 --> 02:13:06.785]  I speak Mandarin Chinese, even though I don't read the language because I didn't memorize all those symbols.
[02:13:07.185 --> 02:13:07.805]  But I do.
[02:13:08.106 --> 02:13:08.766]  I do speak it.
[02:13:08.806 --> 02:13:09.366]  I lived in Asia.
[02:13:10.166 --> 02:13:11.067]  We have staff on the ground.
[02:13:11.107 --> 02:13:16.109]  We're getting a lot of good information and confirmations of information that's being reported by other sources.
[02:13:16.129 --> 02:13:18.430]  I'll be bringing that to you today.
[02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:25.813]  We're also going to be taking your calls and we're going to go shortly, not right this instant, but Johnny and Denmark stay on the line.
[02:13:25.833 --> 02:13:27.274]  I'm going to go to you next.
[02:13:27.614 --> 02:13:37.038]  I just want to say before we get into the calls and into the full details of this hour, my job and my intention here is to be
[02:13:37.945 --> 02:13:49.132]  As as authentic and honest and upfront with you as possible as this pandemic is spreading and I have I sort of have to apologize.
[02:13:49.192 --> 02:13:51.653]  I have been I think too conservative.
[02:13:52.634 --> 02:13:57.837]  I think I've I've I've tried not to talk about the bigger numbers that I know to be true.
[02:13:58.457 --> 02:14:02.960]  And so I have been reporting the official Chinese numbers, which I know to be lies.
[02:14:04.358 --> 02:14:07.021]  And that's it's because we couldn't cite other numbers.
[02:14:07.381 --> 02:14:10.164]  What other source is out there that we can cite?
[02:14:10.885 --> 02:14:13.388]  And so we don't want to go with numbers that we can't confirm.
[02:14:13.408 --> 02:14:16.091]  And that's why I've been very conservative about this.
[02:14:16.872 --> 02:14:22.738]  Also, you know, of course, we don't we don't want to put numbers out there if we can't back them up.
[02:14:23.382 --> 02:14:33.488]  But now, from multiple sources, we have so many layers of confirmation that the Chinese government is lying, and more importantly, that the WHO is in the pocket of the Chinese.
[02:14:33.808 --> 02:14:35.109]  The WHO is lying.
[02:14:35.369 --> 02:14:40.011]  The WHO, in my assessment, wants this pandemic to spread.
[02:14:40.472 --> 02:14:49.757]  I will be covering that today, and I assure you, from this point forward, I'm going to go ahead and mention my assessment of where these numbers really are.
[02:14:51.069 --> 02:14:58.735]  I'll qualify them and say this is my assessment, this is my opinion, you know, as a published scientist, as a researcher, as an independent journalist.
[02:14:59.635 --> 02:15:09.382]  There may never be official sources that tell the true story, because from what I'm hearing, China is executing citizens who show infections.
[02:15:09.862 --> 02:15:15.586]  And the reason that they're executing them is, number one, then they don't have to report them as being infected.
[02:15:16.187 --> 02:15:17.287]  They're no longer infected.
[02:15:17.648 --> 02:15:18.088]  They're dead.
[02:15:18.832 --> 02:15:21.193]  And then once they're dead, what's the cause of death?
[02:15:21.413 --> 02:15:22.533]  Well, a bullet.
[02:15:22.754 --> 02:15:24.734]  It wasn't coronavirus, it was a bullet.
[02:15:24.814 --> 02:15:26.235]  So, gosh, what do you know?
[02:15:26.255 --> 02:15:30.016]  The pandemic's not that bad as long as China shoots all the infected citizens.
[02:15:30.897 --> 02:15:35.198]  So I'm hearing from multiple sources that that's exactly what is going on in China now.
[02:15:35.238 --> 02:15:40.980]  We're talking about a kind of a holocaust in the making here.
[02:15:41.701 --> 02:15:43.481]  Mass deaths, mass graves.
[02:15:43.521 --> 02:15:46.282]  I'm being told that the cremation vans are running 24-7 in China.
[02:15:48.453 --> 02:15:54.181]  People are being kidnapped off the streets and stuffed into cremation vans and taken to ovens.
[02:15:54.942 --> 02:16:01.470]  So yes, I am invoking the imagery, the horrifying history of the Third Reich.
[02:16:01.570 --> 02:16:06.777]  We're not there yet in terms of numbers, but the tactics appear to be the same from Communist China.
[02:16:07.495 --> 02:16:09.516]  People are being treated as prisoners.
[02:16:09.996 --> 02:16:11.556]  This is a crime against humanity.
[02:16:11.596 --> 02:16:13.377]  This is a prison camp situation.
[02:16:13.717 --> 02:16:16.758]  The so-called hospitals are nothing but quarantine prison camps.
[02:16:17.278 --> 02:16:18.759]  This is very bad.
[02:16:19.059 --> 02:16:20.299]  We're being lied to by China.
[02:16:20.339 --> 02:16:21.960]  We're being lied to by the WHO.
[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:26.421]  And I apologize that I haven't mentioned
[02:16:27.119 --> 02:16:31.342]  The higher numbers earlier, the numbers that I'm very certain are true.
[02:16:31.582 --> 02:16:33.384]  So that's my commitment to you today.
[02:16:33.404 --> 02:16:40.248]  It's a massive cover up out there and humanity is going to pay the price if we don't get on top of this very quickly.
[02:16:40.989 --> 02:16:47.954]  We are the voices that are warning humanity and we are the voices that need to be heard and yet we are the voices that of course are being silenced.
[02:16:48.607 --> 02:16:56.932]  Now, with that preamble out of the way, let's go to Johnny in Denmark, who apparently has some comments about AIDS and this pandemic.
[02:16:56.972 --> 02:16:58.073]  Johnny, you're on with Mike Adams.
[02:16:58.113 --> 02:16:58.433]  Go ahead.
[02:16:58.473 --> 02:16:59.093]  Welcome to the show.
[02:16:59.113 --> 02:17:01.014]  Hi, Mike!
[02:17:01.795 --> 02:17:02.955]  Glad to finally talk with you.
[02:17:02.995 --> 02:17:04.516]  I've been following you for a long time.
[02:17:04.877 --> 02:17:08.018]  We're actually friends on Facebook, and I especially enjoyed your
[02:17:09.825 --> 02:17:10.306]  We're good.
[02:17:25.189 --> 02:17:33.015]  I told him you were my pick for the world's leading expert on the, at least publicly available information, on this particular coronavirus.
[02:17:33.355 --> 02:17:42.722]  And with all due respect to Steve, for which I have a lot, he's a polymath in his own right, but on this particular coronavirus, I think you politely reputed him.
[02:17:43.683 --> 02:17:44.523]  Well, I agree.
[02:17:44.543 --> 02:17:48.926]  Thank you for your comments, and I agree that I have great respect for Dr. Pachenik.
[02:17:50.047 --> 02:17:53.771]  I don't know how he and I got wrapped up in an unintentional debate, actually.
[02:17:53.811 --> 02:17:56.833]  It sort of organically formed, but thank you for your comments.
[02:17:56.893 --> 02:18:00.236]  My goal has always been to give you the most accurate information possible.
[02:18:00.336 --> 02:18:02.238]  Not always right 100%, but that's my goal.
[02:18:02.478 --> 02:18:02.879]  But go ahead.
[02:18:02.899 --> 02:18:03.760]  I didn't mean to interrupt.
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:05.741]  No problem.
[02:18:05.881 --> 02:18:14.209]  Actually, the seven people I most wanted to hear from about it beforehand, actually eight people, were you, Nick Begich, Alex Jones, David Knight,
[02:18:14.802 --> 02:18:22.248]  Steve Pochenek, and this is before I heard him, John Rappaport, Owen Schroer, and Dave on the X-22 Report, which has some pretty good coverage.
[02:18:22.608 --> 02:18:25.090]  And the only one I haven't heard from so far is Nick Begich.
[02:18:25.710 --> 02:18:37.539]  But anyway, I don't know if you heard on my call to the David Knight Show, my first ever last week, but just to remind us of things that have happened before which are relevant, I think age is particularly relevant.
[02:18:37.919 --> 02:18:41.962]  I formulated this acronym, which I think is very apt because it's SLEEZE.
[02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:46.512]  Which is SARS, Legionnaire's disease, Ebola, AIDS, Zika, and E. coli.
[02:18:46.952 --> 02:19:01.263]  Not to dismiss the severity of this, however, I don't know if you've read this fantastic book on AIDS, written by Rebecca Kolsch on 2007, titled Science Sold Out, Does HIV Really Cause AIDS?
[02:19:01.986 --> 02:19:04.447]  And spoiler alert, the answer is no.
[02:19:05.308 --> 02:19:06.948]  And she makes a very good scientific case.
[02:19:06.988 --> 02:19:08.109]  She's actually an insider.
[02:19:08.449 --> 02:19:17.353]  She was a world-leading researcher on AIDS and she quit in disgust on AIDS research because it was a virus that wasn't properly identified.
[02:19:17.653 --> 02:19:19.674]  There wasn't even an electron micrograph for it.
[02:19:19.974 --> 02:19:25.016]  So the ultimate answer was that it's the HIV-AIDS hypothesis.
[02:19:25.638 --> 02:19:45.018]  Uh, was false in the sense that HIV was not properly isolated and AIDS didn't exist in the sense that, in many senses, but one very telling one is that the vast majority of so-called AIDS patients die of, you probably know this, liver failure, which is not one of the 30 associated diseases.
[02:19:45.859 --> 02:19:48.782]  And the reason they die of liver failure is the medications that they're given.
[02:19:51.328 --> 02:19:57.953]  I've heard this before, and I've also read books by Dr. Gary Noll, who talks about this as well.
[02:19:58.753 --> 02:20:00.775]  Just to be clear, as I understand it, we're not
[02:20:02.523 --> 02:20:04.165]  We're not denying the existence of AIDS.
[02:20:04.185 --> 02:20:13.917]  What we're saying is that Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome has many other causes, but perhaps that virus is not the only cause.
[02:20:14.018 --> 02:20:20.646]  There's needle sharing, there's sharing of deadly viruses through anal
[02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:24.832]  Anal intercourse, frankly, across the gay community.
[02:20:25.232 --> 02:20:26.953]  Anal cancer is on the rise in that community.
[02:20:27.754 --> 02:20:28.475]  I get your point.
[02:20:29.435 --> 02:20:31.337]  Let's bring this back to coronavirus, though.
[02:20:31.357 --> 02:20:32.578]  That's the topic right now.
[02:20:33.178 --> 02:20:34.239]  How does this relate to that?
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:35.900]  Right.
[02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:41.584]  There were certain lessons learned from the AIDS, I would call it, flu pandemic.
[02:20:41.624 --> 02:20:47.949]  And with all due respect to you, and believe me, I have a lot, I think if you read Rebecca Kulshaw's book, you will have some serious doubts.
[02:20:48.453 --> 02:20:48.653]  About
[02:21:05.803 --> 02:21:09.024]  And they lowered the medication and then went back to 1.1 percent.
[02:21:09.885 --> 02:21:10.545]  Interesting.
[02:21:10.565 --> 02:21:19.309]  So, I mean, yeah, yeah, I would really, it's an easy read, especially for someone of your scientific background, and I would heartily recommend that you read it.
[02:21:19.649 --> 02:21:22.390]  Anyway, I will, absolutely, I will check that out.
[02:21:22.410 --> 02:21:25.131]  We've only got one minute before break, so jump right into it.
[02:21:25.211 --> 02:21:26.032]  Go ahead.
[02:21:26.092 --> 02:21:27.172]  I can speak quickly.
[02:21:28.373 --> 02:21:34.035]  The three lessons learned were, one, the mainstream media and almost unbelievably pathogen-exaggerating
[02:21:34.514 --> 02:21:34.934]  That's right.
[02:21:58.869 --> 02:22:10.032]  The corrupt medical pharmaceutical conspiracy or complex is dangerous even for Nobel Prize laureates about the research area of expertise.
[02:22:10.052 --> 02:22:18.815]  For example, Luc Montagnier, who was given the Nobel Prize for isolating the virus... Johnny, we gotta go to break.
[02:22:19.415 --> 02:22:19.875]  Sorry to interrupt.
[02:22:19.895 --> 02:22:22.015]  You got most of your points in, but we're going to break here.
[02:22:22.336 --> 02:22:23.836]  Great call, good information.
[02:22:23.876 --> 02:22:26.777]  We'll be back after this break with more of your calls and more breaking news.
[02:22:26.817 --> 02:22:27.277]  Stay with us.
[02:22:29.238 --> 02:22:31.939]  All right, more breaking news on the coronavirus pandemic today.
[02:22:31.959 --> 02:22:35.460]  Let's talk about the so-called leaked numbers from China.
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:42.362]  It appears that China has two sets of data on the number of infected patients and the number of dead.
[02:22:42.382 --> 02:22:57.027]  Now, this leaked out of an official Chinese government website that publishes the official data, which many experts around the world believe that those data are artificially low.
[02:22:57.717 --> 02:23:03.002]  You know, the official data that says it's, what, 24,000-something and 400-something deaths right now.
[02:23:03.022 --> 02:23:03.002]  494.
[02:23:03.062 --> 02:23:04.524]  The real numbers may be much, much higher.
[02:23:04.544 --> 02:23:06.625]  As high as 154,000 infections and nearly 25,000 deaths.
[02:23:06.646 --> 02:23:08.888]  And the way that this is being
[02:23:18.803 --> 02:23:28.190]  Discovered is that this official website accidentally published these higher numbers for a few minutes and then reverted them back to the lower numbers.
[02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:38.378]  But as the higher numbers were published the way we know that it wasn't a typo is because above each of these numbers is another number that shows the growth from yesterday from the previous day.
[02:23:39.409 --> 02:23:41.652]  And it's even explained with Chinese characters.
[02:23:41.712 --> 02:23:43.934]  This is the difference from yesterday.
[02:23:44.615 --> 02:23:47.879]  And they were showing for deaths, for example, I think it was plus 1546.
[02:23:48.279 --> 02:23:51.863]  And for infections, it was plus 20,979.
[02:23:54.626 --> 02:23:59.652]  So what this shows is that there's an algorithm that's calculating the difference from the day before.
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:09.045]  And as an engineer myself, you know, I run software teams, I build systems, you know, I built Brighttown.com, or at least my team did, and I ran the team and so on.
[02:24:09.085 --> 02:24:09.565]  I understand.
[02:24:10.085 --> 02:24:16.509]  What this was, was the database that's running this site temporarily connected to the wrong database table, i.e.
[02:24:16.569 --> 02:24:17.789]  the second set of data.
[02:24:18.430 --> 02:24:20.551]  So China has two sets of books.
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:32.806]  You know, just like a mafia organization would have one, you know, one set of books of all their, their prostitution and gang, you know, extortion money or whatever, drug trade money.
[02:24:32.826 --> 02:24:34.887]  And then they would have a public set of books.
[02:24:35.187 --> 02:24:37.708]  Oh, we're just a restaurant or a laundromat or whatever.
[02:24:38.809 --> 02:24:40.870]  China appears to have two sets of books.
[02:24:40.930 --> 02:24:48.694]  Now, it's impossible to ever get a confirmation of this from China because of course they are lying and the WHO is lying.
[02:24:49.395 --> 02:24:51.877]  But there are some clues that underscore this.
[02:24:51.917 --> 02:24:56.901]  For example, China is right now adding more hospital bed capacity.
[02:24:57.582 --> 02:25:06.289]  And according to the Asian media that was translated to me this morning, China is now saying they need 100,000 more hospital beds.
[02:25:07.350 --> 02:25:12.114]  That number is consistent with a huge number of infections such as 154,000 that appeared to have leaked out.
[02:25:15.825 --> 02:25:17.926]  Those numbers are probably even low.
[02:25:17.986 --> 02:25:31.894]  The new leaked numbers are probably low because of course the Chinese government doesn't even have internally in its own secret database, it doesn't even have the full extent of the infections and the deaths fully recorded for all the reasons that we've mentioned already.
[02:25:32.214 --> 02:25:37.477]  For example, the number of deaths is artificially low because China is executing some people.
[02:25:38.271 --> 02:25:40.333]  And then not counting them as coronavirus deaths.
[02:25:40.773 --> 02:25:45.937]  The number of infections is artificially low because many of the infections are diagnosed as something different.
[02:25:46.558 --> 02:25:55.805]  We also know from multiple sources, including the Epoch Times, that has sources that are high-level people inside the Communist Party in China.
[02:25:56.165 --> 02:26:04.271]  We know that there has been artificial scarcity of the diagnostic kits created so that there can't be tests of everyone.
[02:26:04.612 --> 02:26:07.354]  And every time we hear stories of people going to the hospitals there,
[02:26:08.311 --> 02:26:11.632]  To try to get tested, we hear that they're being turned away from the hospitals.
[02:26:12.112 --> 02:26:13.613]  They're sent home to die.
[02:26:14.133 --> 02:26:17.734]  And so we know that China isn't testing everybody who's infected.
[02:26:18.215 --> 02:26:22.476]  And this leads me to now a new assessment that I'll share with you.
[02:26:22.516 --> 02:26:23.416]  This is my opinion.
[02:26:23.456 --> 02:26:25.897]  This was not Infowars opinion or Alex Jones opinion.
[02:26:26.298 --> 02:26:27.178]  This is my opinion.
[02:26:27.838 --> 02:26:32.040]  Last week I said my best guess was that there were a hundred thousand infections in China.
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:32.940]  Today,
[02:26:33.695 --> 02:26:38.245]  My current belief, my best assessment, is that there are between 200,000 and 250,000 infected people in China.
[02:26:42.088 --> 02:26:43.829]  And that's just based on multiple sources.
[02:26:43.849 --> 02:26:46.491]  I can't cite any official source.
[02:26:46.531 --> 02:26:48.373]  We will never be able to cite an official source.
[02:26:48.693 --> 02:26:55.658]  But I think right now, today, we could be looking at a quarter of a million infected people in China, and infections are spreading outside the country.
[02:26:55.918 --> 02:27:02.724]  We now have numbers growing every day in Thailand, in Japan, in Singapore, Malaysia, and other countries.
[02:27:03.064 --> 02:27:09.589]  In fact, there was a quarantine cruise ship just off the coast of Japan confirmed to have at least 10 cases of infections.
[02:27:10.189 --> 02:27:22.434]  Which means that probably everybody on that ship, I think it was 3,500 passengers roughly in that range, probably every one of them has been exposed and we will see a lot more positive infections confirmed in the days ahead.
[02:27:22.454 --> 02:27:25.736]  Now, we're going to go to some calls now.
[02:27:26.176 --> 02:27:29.257]  Mike in Kentucky, I hope you're still on the line.
[02:27:29.597 --> 02:27:34.719]  I'm told you have an interesting call about the situation, what's happening there locally.
[02:27:35.099 --> 02:27:38.401]  Mike in Kentucky, if you're with us, you're live on the air with Mike Adams here.
[02:27:38.441 --> 02:27:38.921]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:27:39.924 --> 02:27:50.252]  And Mike, I had some information I wanted to pass along to you regarding our immediate region is just now starting to see a wave of respiratory and flu-like conditions.
[02:27:50.733 --> 02:28:03.303]  But listen, in regard to the Aging Plum Island Animal Bio Research Facility in New York, that is being replaced by the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility at the Kansas State University.
[02:28:04.083 --> 02:28:06.185]  And that's public knowledge on that site.
[02:28:06.877 --> 02:28:07.897]  That site is built.
[02:28:08.017 --> 02:28:12.459]  That site is up and running now and will completely phase out Palm Island by 2023.
[02:28:12.859 --> 02:28:14.860]  It's a Level 4 laboratory.
[02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:22.302]  And the husband and wife team that are there are doctors that worked with Ebola research in connection with Fort Detrick.
[02:28:22.442 --> 02:28:30.465]  And they're also, post 9-11, wrote the big purple book, which is a epidemiology research type of book.
[02:28:30.645 --> 02:28:32.025]  But it's a Level 4 lab.
[02:28:32.625 --> 02:28:34.846]  And one thing short now, I'll get off of here.
[02:28:35.609 --> 02:28:42.373]  Is that the DARPA P3 program that has been playing with the coronavirus has a civilian counterpart in this Abcilla company.
[02:28:42.974 --> 02:28:53.761]  And an Abcilla representative released about a couple weeks ago that they were working on this and her statement is, this is just the virus we were working on.
[02:28:54.161 --> 02:28:55.782]  So, it's just two points.
[02:28:55.802 --> 02:28:57.543]  This is just the virus we were working on?
[02:28:58.644 --> 02:28:59.384]  You broke up there.
[02:28:59.824 --> 02:29:01.405]  This is just the virus we were working on?
[02:29:01.445 --> 02:29:03.066]  Is that your quote?
[02:29:03.086 --> 02:29:03.907]  That's what you were saying?
[02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:12.718]  Yeah, you'd have to check the Absella site, but their press release says to effect that this is just the type of thing we were waiting for.
[02:29:12.818 --> 02:29:14.679]  This is just the type of thing we've been researching.
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:15.760]  Wow.
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:19.183]  So I really appreciate, I'm a new listener and I appreciate your research.
[02:29:19.203 --> 02:29:24.667]  I'm a retired cryptologist, but I have a strong interest still in tech and bio research, you know.
[02:29:25.706 --> 02:29:26.567]  That's fascinating.
[02:29:27.168 --> 02:29:37.198]  If you're into cryptographic research, then you know all about secrets, and you know all about sort of asymmetrical information, which is what's happening right now.
[02:29:37.619 --> 02:29:46.969]  The Chinese government knows lots of things, but they're only sending a very small portion out to the public, and the public is being deceived by the media, by the tech giants.
[02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:49.911]  As well as the governments themselves.
[02:29:49.971 --> 02:29:50.571]  Great call.
[02:29:50.631 --> 02:29:51.972]  Thank you, Mike, in Kentucky.
[02:29:52.052 --> 02:29:52.732]  I appreciate that.
[02:29:53.073 --> 02:29:56.555]  We're going to continue to take calls, even though we only have a short minute left here.
[02:29:56.595 --> 02:30:02.078]  But let's go to Lauren in Ohio, and we'll continue with you, Lauren, after the break.
[02:30:02.118 --> 02:30:06.281]  But go ahead and give us the opening statement of what you're calling about.
[02:30:06.321 --> 02:30:07.362]  And welcome to the show, Lauren.
[02:30:07.882 --> 02:30:09.004]  Wow, and you know what?
[02:30:09.064 --> 02:30:18.840]  For the gentleman that was just on, I would suggest that he look up the paper, Mycoplasma, The Linking Pathogen in Neurosystemic Diseases by Professor Don Scott.
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:21.384]  It's an 11-page article on the end of the...
[02:30:21.857 --> 02:30:27.601]  Bottom of the first page, it talks all about mycoplasma as a disease, a weaponized agent.
[02:30:28.082 --> 02:30:35.467]  All the different, you know, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control, Bethesda, Maryland, all the, it's all in there.
[02:30:35.667 --> 02:30:36.648]  It's all documented.
[02:30:36.988 --> 02:30:45.974]  The CIA, the MK Naomi, you know, the mycoplasma is a weapon dispersed in insects and... You know, I...
[02:30:47.446 --> 02:30:48.287]  Stay with us, Lauren.
[02:30:48.347 --> 02:30:50.389]  We're going to go to you right after the break.
[02:30:50.869 --> 02:30:51.469]  It's amazing.
[02:30:51.489 --> 02:31:00.297]  The callers are doing so much research and finding so much about the whole history of bioweapons development in the United States and the release of those weapons into the wild.
[02:31:00.317 --> 02:31:01.297]  We'll be back after this break.
[02:31:01.317 --> 02:31:01.778]  Stay with us.
[02:31:03.119 --> 02:31:16.330]  Just as the Fukushima disaster several years ago exposed the danger that the nuclear industry posed to humanity, and we're still paying the price for that, and we will be paying that price for centuries, by the way,
[02:31:17.452 --> 02:31:34.143]  This pandemic outbreak of an engineered biological weapon is showing how that area of weapons research, biowarfare, offensive weapons, as Francis Boyle has said, how that is a grave danger to humanity.
[02:31:34.864 --> 02:31:39.047]  And unlike nuclear weapons, this is a self-replicating weapon system.
[02:31:39.927 --> 02:31:42.329]  Once it's released into the wild, you can't control it.
[02:31:42.429 --> 02:31:43.890]  You can't recall it.
[02:31:44.685 --> 02:31:48.746]  In fact, it takes on a life of its own, and it begins to mutate, and that's already happening.
[02:31:48.766 --> 02:31:55.869]  And we're going to go back to our caller, Lauren, here in just a second, but let me get you some of these just bombshell headlines.
[02:31:55.889 --> 02:31:59.230]  This is just some of what we're covering today, my own staff and reporters.
[02:31:59.750 --> 02:32:03.391]  The coronavirus is already mutating as it jumps from person to person.
[02:32:03.751 --> 02:32:11.654]  Human-to-human transmission is causing an adaptive response, quote, viral evolution, and it may make vaccines pointless.
[02:32:12.074 --> 02:32:13.094]  That's already on the books.
[02:32:13.703 --> 02:32:23.290]  The United Nations WHO chief sides with communist China while blasting the free world for creating a stigma over the coronavirus spread.
[02:32:23.350 --> 02:32:26.433]  So if you believe there's a pandemic, you're a racist.
[02:32:27.173 --> 02:32:27.954]  Just imagine that.
[02:32:29.215 --> 02:32:30.216]  Just imagine that.
[02:32:30.596 --> 02:32:37.722]  You must hate Chinese people for being Chinese, even if you're just commenting about the pandemic and the communist Chinese cover-up.
[02:32:38.462 --> 02:32:39.944]  This is what they used when Obama was president.
[02:32:39.984 --> 02:32:45.211]  You couldn't criticize Obama on his policies because he was black, which makes no sense.
[02:32:46.273 --> 02:32:47.895]  We were never attacking his race.
[02:32:47.995 --> 02:32:50.779]  We were attacking his hatred for America.
[02:32:51.400 --> 02:32:53.483]  Okay, one more headline and then we'll go to Lauren.
[02:32:54.420 --> 02:33:06.511]  The Secretary General of the WHO says that Western nations are withholding coronavirus outbreak data, and the mainstream media is blacklisting that news to keep the public in the dark as the pandemic spreads.
[02:33:06.791 --> 02:33:13.898]  The WHO's official position now is that China is telling the truth, America is lying,
[02:33:14.730 --> 02:33:40.869]  There's really not a pandemic, according to the WHO now, even though they declared a global emergency just a few days earlier, and that there should be no travel restrictions now on Chinese people, that Chinese should be able to freely enter every country right now, anywhere in the world, even if they flew straight out of Wuhan, even if they're coughing, whatever, just let them go everywhere, according to the WHO, and that you're racist if you try to control your border.
[02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:42.690]  Where have we heard this before?
[02:33:43.365 --> 02:33:45.866]  From the Democrats attacking Trump, of course.
[02:33:46.246 --> 02:33:52.669]  So now border control to stop a pandemic is now a racist response according to the WHO.
[02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:57.212]  That's how political correctness is going to get us killed, frankly.
[02:33:57.492 --> 02:34:00.813]  That's how virtue signaling is going to kill people.
[02:34:01.434 --> 02:34:05.696]  Because these lunatics, they want a virtue signal instead of dealing with the pandemic.
[02:34:05.716 --> 02:34:06.276]  Now let's go back
[02:34:06.917 --> 02:34:11.639]  To Lauren in Ohio, who just told us about this microplasma research.
[02:34:11.659 --> 02:34:12.460]  But Lauren, go ahead.
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:14.121]  You had a fascinating introduction.
[02:34:14.541 --> 02:34:16.222]  What was your main point that you wanted to get to?
[02:34:16.242 --> 02:34:18.323]  I just have to go back to what you were saying.
[02:34:18.403 --> 02:34:19.103]  Amen to that.
[02:34:19.583 --> 02:34:20.644]  Four-step program.
[02:34:20.744 --> 02:34:22.365]  Obey God's ten little commandments.
[02:34:22.425 --> 02:34:23.545]  Keep your money in your pocket.
[02:34:23.586 --> 02:34:24.786]  Don't pay taxes you don't owe.
[02:34:24.826 --> 02:34:26.587]  Figure out whether you owe or not.
[02:34:26.907 --> 02:34:29.228]  Keep your children in your home, meaning control their education.
[02:34:29.248 --> 02:34:30.409]  Don't let these people lie to them.
[02:34:30.789 --> 02:34:31.970]  And boycott big business.
[02:34:32.050 --> 02:34:34.151]  We don't need to be doing business with these giant
[02:34:34.671 --> 02:34:35.112]  We're good.
[02:34:51.255 --> 02:34:52.476]  There is no AIDS virus.
[02:34:52.516 --> 02:34:54.836]  I want to read you something from this Mycoplasma paper.
[02:34:56.877 --> 02:35:00.817]  Many doctors don't know about this Mycoplasma disease agent because it was developed by the U.S.
[02:35:00.857 --> 02:35:04.758]  military and biological warfare experimentation and was not made public.
[02:35:05.779 --> 02:35:09.519]  The pathogen was patented by the U.S.
[02:35:09.559 --> 02:35:12.300]  military and Dr. Shai Ching Lo.
[02:35:14.116 --> 02:35:18.098]  I believe that's 5242820 if I'm not mistaken.
[02:35:18.118 --> 02:35:20.300]  89 page patent on page 87.
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:31.006]  A list of all the diseases caused by this mycoplasma which expresses itself depending on your individual DNA and whether or not you're run down.
[02:35:31.587 --> 02:35:32.507]  This is a weapon.
[02:35:33.087 --> 02:35:35.449]  And here's the part that's important with regard to the AIDS.
[02:35:35.709 --> 02:35:39.852]  The special virus cancer program created by the CIA and the National Institutes of Health,
[02:35:40.990 --> 02:35:41.090]  Wow.
[02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.210]  Wow.
[02:36:05.639 --> 02:36:08.581]  You may want to look and see, are you looking at mycoplasma?
[02:36:09.261 --> 02:36:11.502]  See, everybody doesn't have the docking site.
[02:36:11.542 --> 02:36:15.164]  Like, the docking site kills black people and brown people.
[02:36:15.264 --> 02:36:17.005]  What they do, they let it loose in Africa.
[02:36:17.145 --> 02:36:25.309]  Everywhere Bill Gates has been superimposed a map of where they've done vaccines and where the population happens if it's under the age of 21, because everybody's dead.
[02:36:26.178 --> 02:36:29.999]  You know, you're linking to a big global truth about this.
[02:36:30.099 --> 02:36:32.279]  And by the way, your call has been awesome there, Lauren.
[02:36:33.019 --> 02:36:34.600]  We're looking at your document right now.
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:42.161]  But a big global truth about this is that bioweapons research has always gone hand-in-hand with global depopulation agendas.
[02:36:42.461 --> 02:36:46.262]  And we know who's behind that, we know who's funding it, and we know why they're trying to do it.
[02:36:46.422 --> 02:36:47.582]  They hate humanity.
[02:36:48.022 --> 02:36:52.743]  These are the same globalists that are pushing abortion, infanticide, destruction of the family.
[02:36:53.283 --> 02:37:01.491]  They're pushing hatred against men, as if being male is bad, and they're saying that there should be no more mothers and fathers.
[02:37:01.511 --> 02:37:07.096]  I mean, this is an anti-human agenda, and biological weapons is just one of the forms that this takes.
[02:37:07.136 --> 02:37:08.277]  So thank you for your call, Lauren.
[02:37:08.297 --> 02:37:09.298]  That's really fantastic.
[02:37:10.139 --> 02:37:13.522]  Let me bring in something else here, then we're going to go to one more call in this segment.
[02:37:14.323 --> 02:37:14.743]  Here we go.
[02:37:14.783 --> 02:37:16.165]  We have an expert now.
[02:37:17.353 --> 02:37:28.395]  Amesh Adadja, a senior scholar at John Hopkins University Center for Health Security and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
[02:37:28.835 --> 02:37:32.556]  He says, quote, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
[02:37:32.956 --> 02:37:38.917]  There is not a doubt that this is going to end up in most countries eventually.
[02:37:39.778 --> 02:37:42.778]  So I've got sobering news for all of you listening today.
[02:37:43.798 --> 02:37:45.179]  This has broken containment.
[02:37:45.679 --> 02:37:46.979]  It's out of control in China.
[02:37:47.611 --> 02:37:49.652]  They're covering it up by fudging the numbers.
[02:37:50.353 --> 02:37:57.958]  But as I said in an earlier segment, my assessment is this could currently already have infected a quarter of a million people in China.
[02:37:58.098 --> 02:38:01.660]  That's a good estimate, a rational estimate based on the information we have.
[02:38:02.523 --> 02:38:05.744]  As a result, containment is likely impossible.
[02:38:06.184 --> 02:38:10.286]  And sooner or later, this spreads to other countries in Asia in self-sustaining outbreaks.
[02:38:10.626 --> 02:38:12.467]  Seems to be already happening in certain countries.
[02:38:12.907 --> 02:38:15.148]  Perhaps Thailand, for example.
[02:38:15.328 --> 02:38:17.768]  Early numbers there could really explode over the next few weeks.
[02:38:17.808 --> 02:38:18.509]  We hope they don't.
[02:38:18.969 --> 02:38:20.709]  But that's the trend that we're observing.
[02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:24.731]  Eventually, this goes everywhere if these experts are correct.
[02:38:25.271 --> 02:38:37.999]  Rebecca Katz, a professor and director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University says, quote, this is about mitigation at this point and keeping the global spread as minimal as possible.
[02:38:38.599 --> 02:38:39.059]  You hear that?
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:41.601]  She's not saying that this can be contained.
[02:38:41.641 --> 02:38:42.241]  We can stop it.
[02:38:42.261 --> 02:38:43.382]  It's only going to affect China.
[02:38:43.442 --> 02:38:44.342]  America is going to be fine.
[02:38:44.883 --> 02:38:52.027]  What these experts are saying now is that this is about just mitigating the global pandemic because this is going global.
[02:38:52.699 --> 02:38:53.820]  That's the news today.
[02:38:54.321 --> 02:38:57.124]  This is very likely going global.
[02:38:57.164 --> 02:39:02.549]  There's no way to stop it, although it may take many months to come to the United States in larger numbers.
[02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:05.152]  This is burning through the human population now.
[02:39:05.592 --> 02:39:07.534]  It's going to continue to spread.
[02:39:07.574 --> 02:39:09.176]  Now, I want to go to some additional calls.
[02:39:09.757 --> 02:39:11.959]  Tim in Illinois, if you're still with us,
[02:39:13.461 --> 02:39:17.203]  My note here says you've got experience in the Army in the 1970s.
[02:39:17.623 --> 02:39:22.124]  Tim, we've got about a minute, so give us the intro to what you've observed.
[02:39:22.144 --> 02:39:22.985]  What do you have to say here?
[02:39:24.285 --> 02:39:26.846]  Okay, I'll go real fast, Bob.
[02:39:27.787 --> 02:39:30.968]  I was in the Army in the late 70s.
[02:39:31.048 --> 02:39:32.128]  I was in Germany.
[02:39:32.788 --> 02:39:36.870]  Everybody in our unit got some type of lesions on their face.
[02:39:38.287 --> 02:39:42.929]  And they told us, the cadre told us that was some type of herpes.
[02:39:43.890 --> 02:39:46.191]  Anyway, it stayed with me until I got out.
[02:39:46.731 --> 02:39:52.874]  And then, but I got it in the corner of my mouth and it wouldn't go away.
[02:39:53.554 --> 02:39:56.436]  And I kept applying like alcohol with swabs of it.
[02:39:56.476 --> 02:39:59.457]  It would just scab over and it would just break out again.
[02:39:59.977 --> 02:40:05.440]  And then my mother told me to take acidophilus and that cleared it up.
[02:40:07.045 --> 02:40:07.906]  Well, that's interesting.
[02:40:08.447 --> 02:40:14.493]  Perhaps showing exposure of military troops to various infectious agents.
[02:40:14.533 --> 02:40:16.956]  That's, of course, part of the history of medical experimentation.
[02:40:17.477 --> 02:40:18.358]  Interesting call.
[02:40:18.678 --> 02:40:21.121]  We're going to continue to take your calls here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:21.161 --> 02:40:23.203]  This is Mike Adams going to break right now.
[02:40:23.444 --> 02:40:25.846]  We'll be back in just a few minutes to continue.
[02:40:25.886 --> 02:40:26.247]  Stay with us.
[02:40:27.509 --> 02:40:29.670]  All right, we're going to go to more calls here in this segment.
[02:40:29.690 --> 02:40:31.291]  The callers have just been outstanding.
[02:40:31.331 --> 02:40:34.953]  Thanks to all of you who are holding and thanks to all of you who called.
[02:40:34.973 --> 02:40:37.294]  We're going to go to John in Colorado here in just a second.
[02:40:37.314 --> 02:40:43.957]  He's apparently got information about supplies being perhaps wiped out in Colorado there.
[02:40:44.017 --> 02:40:46.098]  So, John, you're on here live with Mike Adams.
[02:40:46.158 --> 02:40:47.319]  If you're still there, go ahead.
[02:40:51.681 --> 02:40:52.481]  Hello?
[02:40:52.902 --> 02:40:53.122]  Yes.
[02:40:53.402 --> 02:40:53.802]  Hi, John.
[02:40:54.543 --> 02:40:55.063]  Welcome to the show.
[02:40:56.204 --> 02:40:59.886]  All right, so I got just some observations.
[02:41:00.186 --> 02:41:06.370]  I've just noticed, because with my work, I'm on Home Depot, I'm at Walmart, I'm at the post office all the time.
[02:41:07.410 --> 02:41:20.058]  And I just noticed, the first thing that I noticed that was weird was there was men in military fatigues hanging out in the aisles that sell like all the masks and things like that.
[02:41:20.158 --> 02:41:24.260]  They weren't getting them, but they were just kind of like there at the end caps.
[02:41:27.015 --> 02:41:27.816]  Okay.
[02:41:28.096 --> 02:41:33.840]  Just kind of like, I guess, seeing who is buying them or whatnot.
[02:41:34.261 --> 02:41:49.772]  The other strange thing is I noticed a lot of people, I don't know where they're from, but they're obviously of Asian descent and they're buying up all the masks at Walmarts, Home Depots.
[02:41:50.112 --> 02:41:52.534]  And then also at the post office, I noticed a lot of
[02:41:53.581 --> 02:41:55.103]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:41:55.643 --> 02:41:58.607]  This is something that we've confirmed from our staff in Taiwan.
[02:41:59.067 --> 02:42:01.831]  What's happening in Taiwan is
[02:42:14.588 --> 02:42:24.932]  The Taiwan Postal Service is actually intercepting large packages where people in Taiwan are buying or attempting to buy large amounts of masks and shipping them to China because China has a severe shortage.
[02:42:25.412 --> 02:42:28.513]  And so the prices on the black market for those masks are very high in China.
[02:42:28.874 --> 02:42:37.097]  So the Taiwan government is intercepting those packages and shipping them back to the Taiwan people where they have now daily restrictions.
[02:42:37.137 --> 02:42:40.218]  You can only buy three masks per day per person.
[02:42:40.798 --> 02:42:41.539]  In Taiwan.
[02:42:41.819 --> 02:42:42.619]  So that's interesting.
[02:42:42.639 --> 02:42:43.920]  What else did you want to add there?
[02:42:43.940 --> 02:42:45.121]  You were about to say something else?
[02:42:46.281 --> 02:42:55.787]  Yeah, the only other thing that I wanted to ask you, because I know there's a lot of talk about it being a bioweapon from the laboratory in Wuhan.
[02:42:56.768 --> 02:43:09.215]  Is it possible that the Chinese government could have been trying to implement like an experimental vaccine to protect its people against
[02:43:09.662 --> 02:43:15.760]  The weapon they're working on but the vaccine itself may have not protected but actually had like live
[02:43:20.563 --> 02:43:26.068]  That's one of the theories that's out there.
[02:43:26.108 --> 02:43:27.529]  That's certainly a possibility.
[02:43:27.890 --> 02:43:30.492]  That's a theory, you know, the vaccine experiment theory.
[02:43:31.733 --> 02:43:37.878]  My assessment, even though I'm not ruling that out at the moment, my assessment is that this was an accidental release of a biological weapon.
[02:43:38.699 --> 02:43:40.901]  But it's interesting that Francis Boyle mentioned that
[02:43:41.494 --> 02:43:51.320]  He believes that the globalists around the world have already received the vaccine against this pandemic strain of coronavirus via the Peerbrite Institute.
[02:43:51.380 --> 02:43:54.461]  So that's an interesting theory that needs to be looked into.
[02:43:54.541 --> 02:43:55.242]  But great call.
[02:43:55.282 --> 02:43:55.982]  Thank you for your call.
[02:43:56.242 --> 02:43:57.163]  I want to take more calls.
[02:43:57.203 --> 02:44:02.826]  Let's go to Tracy in Indiana that you've got some information about local activity.
[02:44:02.866 --> 02:44:03.907]  Is that correct, Tracy?
[02:44:05.728 --> 02:44:06.028]  Yes.
[02:44:06.168 --> 02:44:06.648]  Hi, Mike.
[02:44:06.928 --> 02:44:07.849]  Are you there?
[02:44:08.471 --> 02:44:09.571]  I am here, yeah.
[02:44:09.731 --> 02:44:10.652]  Welcome to the show.
[02:44:10.672 --> 02:44:12.392]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[02:44:12.432 --> 02:44:13.192]  It's a privilege.
[02:44:13.712 --> 02:44:17.273]  Yes, I live in northwest Indiana between Chicago and Gary.
[02:44:18.174 --> 02:44:29.437]  And I was out with my kids, my eight, nine-year-old on Friday, running my errands, and I saw a lot of just kind of piggybacks with the last caller, a lot of Asian descent people.
[02:44:29.757 --> 02:44:34.518]  I've lived in Indiana all my life, never seen swarms of this before.
[02:44:35.243 --> 02:44:36.964]  Yeah, I'm in the grocery store.
[02:44:37.005 --> 02:44:39.627]  There's a very overly friendly lady.
[02:44:41.048 --> 02:44:48.493]  She says she's been here for a long time, very broken English, saying how nice Americans are and stuff like that.
[02:44:48.593 --> 02:44:49.834]  I'm in the meat section.
[02:44:50.475 --> 02:44:57.520]  And I noticed also that our local grocery store had wet wipes there, so call me paranoid or whatever.
[02:44:57.620 --> 02:45:00.162]  I walked away from her and went and got some wet wipes.
[02:45:01.123 --> 02:45:04.766]  And then the kids and I were making a preparedness run, of all things.
[02:45:05.233 --> 02:45:07.675]  Do you have Meijer down in Texas?
[02:45:09.116 --> 02:45:11.878]  No, that's not a retailer here.
[02:45:12.739 --> 02:45:15.181]  OK, it's like a Target, Walmart type thing.
[02:45:15.841 --> 02:45:23.827]  So we go over there to make our preparedness run, and once again, the Meijer is just swarmed with them.
[02:45:24.788 --> 02:45:28.991]  And there was this very weird situation.
[02:45:29.852 --> 02:45:31.473]  We're in the checkout line.
[02:45:31.954 --> 02:45:38.899]  And this guy in street clothes of Asian descent was walking back and forth looking around on a cell phone.
[02:45:39.820 --> 02:45:44.764]  And that's on the store side of the cash registers.
[02:45:45.524 --> 02:45:56.052]  And then on the front of the store where the wall is, the front wall, they're all like loitering around, these kids in like their early 20s or so, on cell phones.
[02:45:57.592 --> 02:46:03.676]  Like I said, I've lived in Northwestern Indiana all my life, and I've never seen anything like this before.
[02:46:04.016 --> 02:46:06.517]  Okay, so, I mean, it's an interesting call.
[02:46:06.597 --> 02:46:07.678]  I appreciate your information.
[02:46:07.978 --> 02:46:14.222]  Your call and a previous call, basically what you're both telling me is that Asian people are buying, you know, preparedness gear, which
[02:46:15.325 --> 02:46:16.286]  Everybody should be doing that.
[02:46:16.466 --> 02:46:24.912]  So, you know, I'm not surprised to see people of Asian descent out there buying masks and hand sanitizers and things like that.
[02:46:25.172 --> 02:46:26.953]  It actually tells me they're ahead of the curve on this.
[02:46:27.314 --> 02:46:31.116]  It actually makes me wonder, why aren't average Americans out there buying this gear?
[02:46:31.156 --> 02:46:35.359]  Because this thing's going global, according to experts that I quoted in the previous segment.
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:38.742]  And I would not be surprised that, you know,
[02:46:39.509 --> 02:46:48.152]  Asian people, and remember my wife is Asian, I lived in Asia, that Asian people are ahead of the curve on this.
[02:46:48.652 --> 02:47:00.676]  They're getting texts, you know, from maybe their relatives or friends in Taiwan or in Hong Kong or in China, and they're actually seeing the news that is being denied to the average American by the mainstream media here in America.
[02:47:00.976 --> 02:47:04.917]  So what you're saying, I absolutely believe it, is very accurate.
[02:47:05.467 --> 02:47:08.090]  But let's remember, everybody should be out there doing that.
[02:47:08.711 --> 02:47:10.793]  And your call is great, by the way.
[02:47:10.813 --> 02:47:11.273]  Thank you for your call.
[02:47:11.293 --> 02:47:27.951]  I also just want to mention, as a racial profiling type of thing, I'm a little bit concerned that as this pandemic gets a lot worse, we've already started to see, I think in New York, one person beat up an Asian woman because she was wearing a mask.
[02:47:29.037 --> 02:47:34.500]  And in Asia, when you wear a mask, you do so because you don't want to be infected.
[02:47:34.540 --> 02:47:38.783]  It's normal to see people wearing masks every day on the street, even without a pandemic.
[02:47:39.083 --> 02:47:42.845]  People riding their motor scooters down the streets of Taipei, they've got masks on.
[02:47:42.905 --> 02:47:43.826]  It's totally normal.
[02:47:44.266 --> 02:47:50.190]  In America, the American view of this is that Asians who are wearing masks must be infected.
[02:47:50.870 --> 02:47:52.071]  And so what's happening is,
[02:47:53.144 --> 02:48:03.692]  Asian people, Taiwan people, Hong Kong people, China people, are coming to America and they're wearing masks as a measure of protection to try to prevent getting infected.
[02:48:04.312 --> 02:48:11.077]  And then some Americans who are not familiar with Asian culture are looking at them and saying, oh my god, that person must be infected.
[02:48:11.117 --> 02:48:11.757]  I have to get away.
[02:48:12.197 --> 02:48:16.000]  So I want to try to educate people because I've lived in both worlds.
[02:48:16.020 --> 02:48:16.981]  You know, I speak Chinese.
[02:48:17.001 --> 02:48:19.883]  I want to tell people that
[02:48:20.718 --> 02:48:25.932]  Asian people are smart to be getting prepared, and American people are way behind right now.
[02:48:27.532 --> 02:48:32.015]  There's going to be a day where the American people wake up and say, hey, why didn't we go buy masks?
[02:48:32.035 --> 02:48:33.756]  Why didn't we buy latex gloves?
[02:48:34.116 --> 02:48:37.578]  Why didn't we get colloidal silver or a backup food supply?
[02:48:37.898 --> 02:48:42.641]  You know, well, the media was lying to you and the tech giants were censoring the truth, right?
[02:48:43.181 --> 02:48:44.942]  And the government was lying to you as well.
[02:48:45.262 --> 02:48:47.704]  And the government people are lying to the president.
[02:48:48.084 --> 02:48:49.645]  President Trump is not a virologist.
[02:48:49.685 --> 02:48:50.825]  He doesn't know all this stuff.
[02:48:50.865 --> 02:48:52.766]  He's relying on people who are lying to him.
[02:48:53.487 --> 02:48:56.208]  So I don't blame Trump for this, by the way, but the people who are lying to him.
[02:48:56.609 --> 02:48:56.949]  But I just,
[02:48:57.859 --> 02:49:04.105]  I just want to mention, everybody, all human beings on planet Earth should be preparing.
[02:49:04.465 --> 02:49:13.613]  Doesn't matter if you're Asian, you know, if you're Latino, if you're black, or white, or European, or Russian, or whatever, everybody should be getting prepared right now.
[02:49:13.913 --> 02:49:15.835]  And the fact that most people are not getting prepared,
[02:49:16.579 --> 02:49:26.243]  Is probably going to make this worse, and it's the complicity of the media lying to the people right now, covering this up, and even attacking those of us who are telling the truth about all this.
[02:49:26.763 --> 02:49:28.523]  The media is going to make this much worse.
[02:49:28.904 --> 02:49:35.186]  The media, I'm convinced, the left-wing media and the WHO and the tech giants,
[02:49:36.283 --> 02:49:37.683]  They want more people to die.
[02:49:37.724 --> 02:49:38.964]  They want this thing to spread.
[02:49:39.364 --> 02:49:44.926]  Why would the WHO say, stop blocking infected Chinese people from entering your country?
[02:49:44.986 --> 02:49:47.067]  Why would they say that if they didn't want it to spread?
[02:49:47.767 --> 02:49:49.667]  So, you know, we've had great callers today.
[02:49:50.628 --> 02:49:54.029]  A lot of good information, a lot of analysis, people doing the research out there.
[02:49:54.713 --> 02:49:56.154]  You are just the best audience in the world.
[02:49:56.174 --> 02:49:57.595]  You're super well-informed.
[02:49:57.616 --> 02:50:01.499]  And I know that you are out there getting supplies right now, even though most Americans are not.
[02:50:01.539 --> 02:50:09.486]  But just realize, you are living in a nation of people who are oblivious to the reality of what is happening right now.
[02:50:09.906 --> 02:50:18.113]  And most people will remain oblivious until the day they panic because they did nothing to prepare, because they were completely isolated from knowledge.
[02:50:18.533 --> 02:50:20.373]  Because of the censorship and the fake media.
[02:50:20.793 --> 02:50:23.374]  And that's why it's crucial to spread the word about InfoWars.
[02:50:23.694 --> 02:50:25.574]  Get more people to watch this show.
[02:50:26.274 --> 02:50:27.715]  Read my website, Natural News.
[02:50:28.735 --> 02:50:33.196]  My articles are also republished on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com as well.
[02:50:33.296 --> 02:50:35.016]  Summit News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:50:35.616 --> 02:50:40.337]  Use the independent media to get informed and help people get prepared so we can save lives together.
[02:50:40.477 --> 02:50:40.837]  All of us.
[02:50:41.217 --> 02:50:41.837]  All over the world.
[02:50:42.037 --> 02:50:42.857]  We're all human beings.
[02:50:42.877 --> 02:50:43.937]  We all deserve to live.
[02:50:44.277 --> 02:50:44.977]  Thank you for watching.
[02:50:45.098 --> 02:50:45.958]  Mike Adams here today.
[02:50:46.298 --> 02:50:47.718]  War Room is up next with Owen Schroyer.
[02:51:00.222 --> 02:51:03.944]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:51:04.504 --> 02:51:07.745]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:51:08.006 --> 02:51:10.667]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:51:11.267 --> 02:51:14.128]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:51:14.829 --> 02:51:16.509]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:51:17.070 --> 02:51:18.530]  I suggest Band.Video.
[02:51:19.151 --> 02:51:24.253]  You will now have Band.Video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:51:24.613 --> 02:51:28.415]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them
[02:51:28.755 --> 02:51:32.556]  Have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:51:33.076 --> 02:51:39.458]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:51:39.778 --> 02:51:42.679]  However you want, be sure and share Band.Video.
[02:51:51.921 --> 02:51:52.802]  InfoWars
[02:51:55.834 --> 02:51:58.598]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:51:59.258 --> 02:52:00.720]  Something big's about to happen.
[02:52:01.361 --> 02:52:02.883]  And I'm not sure it's this virus.
[02:52:03.884 --> 02:52:04.065]  But...
[02:52:05.751 --> 02:52:08.173]  We need to have our bases covered with the virus.
[02:52:09.273 --> 02:52:14.757]  And, you know, I said I would talk about this because this is an important decision for all you out there to think about and decide what you're going to do.
[02:52:14.897 --> 02:52:16.057]  This is in Congress.
[02:52:16.197 --> 02:52:17.879]  This is 13 years ago.
[02:52:18.099 --> 02:52:19.019]  And this is the company.
[02:52:19.119 --> 02:52:23.582]  And when I got this information four or five days ago, I said, listen, are you sure you want me to do this?
[02:52:23.782 --> 02:52:27.705]  Because you've got Department of Defense contracts, you've got a lot of others, and they might mess with you.
[02:52:27.725 --> 02:52:29.205]  I'm like, no, no, you know, we're the owners.
[02:52:29.606 --> 02:52:30.206]  We like what you're doing.
[02:52:30.226 --> 02:52:31.107]  We've got a partnership with you.
[02:52:31.187 --> 02:52:34.349]  We want people to know how important this is of the Department of Defense.
[02:52:35.049 --> 02:52:40.610]  And congressional reports say that this product, NanoSilver, has been found to knock out SARS.
[02:52:41.070 --> 02:52:42.471]  Well, no crap, Sherlock.
[02:52:42.491 --> 02:52:43.311]  Of course it does.
[02:52:43.511 --> 02:52:44.771]  Viruses, bacteria, you name it.
[02:52:44.871 --> 02:52:47.952]  Nobody's selling 16 ounces of NanoSilver that's patented.
[02:52:47.972 --> 02:52:49.312]  This is the top company in the U.S.
[02:52:49.332 --> 02:52:50.412]  that we're... Not even a private label.
[02:52:50.432 --> 02:52:51.693]  This is something they developed with my dad.
[02:52:51.753 --> 02:52:52.393]  The Immune Gargle.
[02:52:52.473 --> 02:52:53.053]  But here's the deal.
[02:52:53.153 --> 02:52:58.114]  Department of the Army, Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command, Tampa, Point Boulevard.
[02:52:58.294 --> 02:52:58.454]  I think?
[02:53:16.974 --> 02:53:17.334]  I think so.
[02:53:42.347 --> 02:53:43.668]  It's the grace of God that stuff like this happens.
[02:53:43.688 --> 02:53:45.028]  This is the top company, folks.
[02:54:08.860 --> 02:54:10.041]  And they're like, no, just say who we are.
[02:54:10.061 --> 02:54:13.063]  Robert Keith Muller, CEO, American Biotech Labs, LLC.
[02:54:13.103 --> 02:54:13.703]  That's the big one.
[02:54:13.723 --> 02:54:17.106]  They're the only ones that have approved, over-the-counter, super silver womb gel.
[02:54:17.146 --> 02:54:18.346]  Do not take this internally.
[02:54:18.366 --> 02:54:24.771]  This is super, well, let's just say what it is, poisonous to bacteria and viruses, which means it ain't too good for you, but it's better than dying, right?
[02:54:25.291 --> 02:54:26.892]  So this goes on the hands and things.
[02:54:26.912 --> 02:54:27.773]  It's a protective shield.
[02:54:27.793 --> 02:54:30.174]  If you get cut or something, your micro scratches, it seals it in.
[02:54:30.294 --> 02:54:33.196]  But all the other products, they're all discounted right now during this crisis.
[02:54:33.296 --> 02:54:33.997]  InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:55:14.986 --> 02:55:20.449]  I didn't just start selling storable food to the audience last month or six months ago or a year ago.
[02:55:21.429 --> 02:55:25.511]  I've been selling storable food to people that believe they need to get it.
[02:55:26.724 --> 02:55:28.826]  I've been doing that for 20 plus years.
[02:55:28.846 --> 02:55:32.068]  Because it made sense to me to have insurance you can eat during any crisis.
[02:55:32.228 --> 02:55:34.310]  And we hope Trump and America wins.
[02:55:34.390 --> 02:55:36.011]  We hope the globalists get defeated.
[02:55:36.112 --> 02:55:43.537]  But in a war like this, there isn't any arming that wins a war, politically or militarily, that doesn't have food backing it up.
[02:55:43.678 --> 02:55:45.319]  And so that's what we're talking about here.
[02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:48.942]  Went into Russia, he ran out of food, he failed.
[02:55:49.302 --> 02:55:51.504]  Hitler went into Russia, he ran out of food, he failed.
[02:55:51.645 --> 02:55:54.747]  So, you know, Adam Schiff wants us to defeat the Russians, we need lots of food to do that.
[02:55:54.888 --> 02:55:56.449]  No, we need to defeat the Adam Schiffs of the world.
[02:55:56.529 --> 02:56:00.293]  Because if you don't have food, they control you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:00.393 --> 02:56:02.775]  So, I believe in storable food 20-something years ago.
[02:56:02.875 --> 02:56:03.496]  Got it myself.
[02:56:03.656 --> 02:56:04.837]  It's insurance you can always eat.
[02:56:04.957 --> 02:56:11.062]  But then I noticed that even though they were big, reputable companies, during a big spike they'd make people wait months to get their food and they'd play games.
[02:56:11.202 --> 02:56:16.986]  Well, going back more than 11 years ago, they've been around 12 years, iPatriot Supply came along and promised to be different.
[02:56:17.347 --> 02:56:22.551]  And I slowly worked with them for a couple years to test them out, and now, 10, 11 years later, they're the best.
[02:56:23.251 --> 02:56:24.912]  And again, it's like everything that's the best.
[02:56:25.473 --> 02:56:29.836]  You could have a nexus point, like a graph, like what's the lowest price versus what's the best quality.
[02:56:30.197 --> 02:56:34.140]  There's some stuff that I pointed out costs way more, 3, 4, 5, 6 times more.
[02:56:34.420 --> 02:56:35.121]  It's like gourmet.
[02:56:35.141 --> 02:56:36.242]  It's ridiculous how good it is.
[02:56:36.562 --> 02:56:37.303]  But it costs way more.
[02:56:37.943 --> 02:56:39.725]  But on a nexus point, this is right in the middle.
[02:56:40.485 --> 02:56:45.186]  Super low-cost, the lowest you're gonna find for any decent food, and it's really good, high-quality stuff.
[02:56:45.206 --> 02:56:46.226]  Some stuff's like gourmet.
[02:56:46.246 --> 02:56:47.827]  It's like, damn, I eat this every day.
[02:56:47.847 --> 02:56:48.887]  Other stuff's like, yeah, it's pretty good.
[02:56:49.307 --> 02:56:55.688]  The point is, it's really good, and it's not a scam, and they're people that are smart and want a long-term relationship.
[02:56:55.748 --> 02:56:57.149]  You buy it at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:56:57.209 --> 02:56:58.649]  They're in the back end of our computers.
[02:56:58.809 --> 02:56:59.909]  It's my patron supply.
[02:56:59.989 --> 02:57:04.030]  We just get some of the money to fund our operation when you buy it there, InfoWare Store, and they ship it out to you.
[02:57:04.090 --> 02:57:06.071]  They've got food for another 12 days or so.
[02:57:06.111 --> 02:57:06.871]  They're honest about that.
[02:57:06.951 --> 02:57:09.211]  What they don't have is the people to pack it.
[02:57:09.311 --> 02:57:16.553]  So they're going 24 hours a day at their three factories in the United States, one in Utah, the other two big ones, and that's what's happening.
[02:57:16.613 --> 02:57:18.874]  No, they're there, and they're taking your orders.
[02:57:18.914 --> 02:57:24.235]  The other big companies just instantly, when institutions called, big corporations, governments called, they sold out.
[02:57:24.255 --> 02:57:26.896]  The Chi-Coms bought up all the masks, they tried to buy up all the food they can.
[02:57:27.056 --> 02:57:27.216]  Great!
[02:57:27.296 --> 02:57:28.297]  The Chinese need food.
[02:57:28.417 --> 02:57:28.657]  I get it.
[02:57:28.677 --> 02:57:29.277]  They're shipping it over there.
[02:57:29.338 --> 02:57:29.758]  That's great.
[02:57:29.918 --> 02:57:36.823]  We are selling food to the American people, and that's the message and the mission of Tim Redhawk, the founder and their CEO, that's coming on with us next second.
[02:57:36.903 --> 02:57:39.404]  But this is something that is the trifecta.
[02:57:39.504 --> 02:57:41.185]  It's great food you and your family need.
[02:57:41.386 --> 02:57:47.990]  It funds the information war, and at the same time, it gives you the confidence to know that you've taken care of yourself and your family.
[02:57:48.010 --> 02:57:48.991]  So, it's that simple.
[02:57:49.071 --> 02:57:50.472]  It's called Ready Hour.
[02:57:51.172 --> 02:57:54.795]  Now, we used to call it InfoWars Select, because I could get around the rules they had at their company.
[02:57:55.176 --> 02:57:58.038]  They were even lower in the prices to dominate the market.
[02:57:58.098 --> 02:57:59.099]  I am their biggest distributor.
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:00.501]  That's how we fund this operation.
[02:58:01.942 --> 02:58:03.964]  But they came to me and they said, that's boosting the price.
[02:58:03.984 --> 02:58:04.905]  You have to private label it.
[02:58:06.510 --> 02:58:07.311]  Not the private labeling.
[02:58:07.331 --> 02:58:08.151]  Just call it what we call it.
[02:58:08.411 --> 02:58:08.811]  Ready Hour.
[02:58:08.912 --> 02:58:09.272]  So we do.
[02:58:09.612 --> 02:58:11.033]  Just order at Infoworkstore.com.
[02:58:11.593 --> 02:58:12.734]  It funds our whole operation.
[02:58:13.435 --> 02:58:14.595]  And it really is excellent.
[02:58:14.655 --> 02:58:15.376]  It's super high quality.
[02:58:15.396 --> 02:58:18.078]  They have special meals for special diets and so much more.
[02:58:18.098 --> 02:58:18.838]  They have four weeks.
[02:58:18.858 --> 02:58:19.538]  They have three months.
[02:58:19.819 --> 02:58:20.359]  They have four months.
[02:58:20.379 --> 02:58:20.939]  They have six months.
[02:58:20.959 --> 02:58:21.500]  They have years.
[02:58:21.980 --> 02:58:27.604]  This is something everyone should do to invest in their future and to begin the road towards preparedness.
[02:58:27.624 --> 02:58:28.905]  Because the Chinese say,
[02:58:29.625 --> 02:58:32.368]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:58:32.709 --> 02:58:37.054]  Well, getting swearable food and firearms is more than the single step.
[02:58:40.157 --> 02:58:42.460]  InfoWars.
[02:58:44.082 --> 02:58:46.765]  The most banned network in the world.
