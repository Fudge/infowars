[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:05.434]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:17.544]  Meanwhile, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton has been calling out China for its response to this outbreak, suggesting the virus may have come from China's biological warfare program.
[00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:24.370]  The Chinese ambassador to the United States responded this, it's very dangerous to stir up suspicion, rumors and spread them among the people.
[00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.251]  For one thing, this will create panic.
[00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:34.376]  Another thing, that it will offend up racial discrimination, xenophobia, all these things that will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus.
[00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:37.158]  Of course, there are all kinds of speculation and rumors.
[00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:41.460]  So far, at least 69,000 people have been infected with coronavirus.
[00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:42.421]  Over 1,600 have died.
[00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:45.823]  Maria, the situation is very grave.
[00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:50.606]  In part because, as you say, China was lying from the beginning and they're still lying today.
[00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:54.207]  And also because there are so many unknowns about this virus.
[00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:58.370]  For example, how many people one person can infect once they have the virus.
[00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.291]  The extent to which it's contagious before one is symptomatic.
[00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:02.572]  Maria, they have...
[00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:23.016]  More than 70 million people now under quarantine and you've probably seen the videos online from social media sites as have I of the Chinese Communist Party's police beating people who they think might have coronavirus or trying to keep them locked inside of their apartments or quarantining them in large hospitals or what have you.
[00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:25.837]  They have not been transparent at all and they need to be.
[00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:29.397]  This virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market.
[00:01:29.497 --> 00:01:31.738]  Epidemiologists who are widely respected
[00:01:32.378 --> 00:01:41.886]  From China, who have published or studied in the international journal The Lancet, have demonstrated that several of the original cases did not have any contact with that food market.
[00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:45.529]  The virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market.
[00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.071]  So we don't know where it originated.
[00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:49.693]  But we do know that we have to get to the bottom of that.
[00:01:50.073 --> 00:02:00.122]  We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China's only biosafety level 4 super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases.
[00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:07.123]  We have such laboratories ourselves in the United States run by our military and large part done for preventative purposes.
[00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:10.664]  We're trying to discover vaccines or to protect our own soldiers.
[00:02:11.084 --> 00:02:15.145]  China is obviously very secretive about what happens at the Wuhan laboratory.
[00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:20.046]  But China continues to block our ability to ask those questions and get that evidence.
[00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:28.088]  Well, the burden of proof right now is on the Chinese Communist Party and the ambassador of China and his fellow communists.
[00:02:28.408 --> 00:02:34.551]  They have lied consistently about this virus from the beginning, so we should not take their word at face value.
[00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:44.776]  And no, we don't want to have a public panic, but we do want to err on the side of caution when so much is unknown, and that is consistently what China has not done.
[00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:56.342]  By consistently lying to its own people and to the world, they have created a situation where we have not been able to take the preventative measures that we might have, and we have not been able to err on the side of caution.
[00:02:56.502 --> 00:03:04.651]  We went from a situation where they were reporting only a couple hundred more cases, or maybe a thousand more cases a day, to almost 14,000 cases in a single day.
[00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:07.414]  That wasn't the result of any scientific discovery.
[00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:11.879]  That was a political decision to finally reveal what they knew to be true.
[00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:18.386]  Yet they are still covering up, in all likelihood, the number of cases and deaths from coronavirus inside of China.
[00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:21.607]  It is Monday, February 17th.
[00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:23.048]  The year is 2020.
[00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:27.009]  We're 259 days out from the historic election.
[00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:37.053]  And I wanted to kick the transmission off today with Senator Cotton, as you just heard, on Fox News laying out the fact that
[00:03:37.993 --> 00:03:50.016]  All the evidence points towards this virus being man-made and the communist Chinese have been putting out false numbers on the number of infected and the number of people that have died.
[00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:54.838]  There's some excellent boildowns that lay all this down up on Infowars.com.
[00:03:55.278 --> 00:04:00.159]  China's coronavirus numbers don't add up and the White House doesn't believe them.
[00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:05.280]  We're going to be breaking all of this down when we come back on the other side.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.661]  That is a report
[00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:15.612]  Out of zero hedge, and of course we just played a clip of this, Senator Cotton China refusing to hand over evidence about Wuhan Biolab.
[00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:20.579]  We know they're using this as a giant police state crackdown in China.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.761]  And now they're saying it's going to mutate like the flu every year and basically be here forever.
[00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:29.581]  And Bill Gates is saying it could kill 10 million alone in Africa.
[00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:43.864]  More and more it looks like this wasn't just an escaped bioweapon that was being developed for a vaccine, but that it's part of a larger globalist move against the nation-state, a global government, to answer the crisis of a global pandemic.
[00:04:44.124 --> 00:04:45.184]  We're going to lay it all out.
[00:04:45.304 --> 00:04:47.324]  On the other side, please spread the word.
[00:04:47.384 --> 00:04:48.545]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:04:49.965 --> 00:04:50.705]  It is Monday.
[00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:53.810]  February 17th, the year is 2020.
[00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:05.354]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to have a jam-packed transmission today with Owen Schroer, Max Keiser, and so much more.
[00:05:05.474 --> 00:05:09.896]  But I wanted to come to you at the very beginning of the broadcast
[00:05:11.587 --> 00:05:20.915]  And just point out that we've done the research, we've done the background investigations, we've interviewed the top experts like Dr. Francis Boyle that authored the U.S.
[00:05:21.015 --> 00:05:24.859]  bioweapons law that became the global treaty.
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.505]  We have had so many of the top journalists on that have major contacts in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
[00:05:32.574 --> 00:05:39.655]  And we have really successfully chronicled what's really happening with this virus and the fact that it's man-made.
[00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:43.996]  InfoWars has yet again been the very vanguard and the tip of the spear.
[00:05:44.537 --> 00:05:47.057]  Now, that's really not been that hard.
[00:05:47.217 --> 00:05:50.558]  The establishment media has known what's going on from the beginning as well.
[00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.738]  They have just been involved in an active cover-up.
[00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:55.679]  So before I get to
[00:05:57.386 --> 00:05:59.147]  The latest breaking information.
[00:05:59.187 --> 00:06:12.336]  I want to play a clip from the end of last night's Sunday broadcast, in the last 10 minutes or so, when I had Mike Adams on, because I came out of break and I said, look, the evidence is mounting.
[00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:18.420]  The preparation, the pre-programming, the global scripting, governments working in unison other than the U.S.
[00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:25.818]  Shows me that this is a man-made bioweapon, as we already know, that has been purposefully released.
[00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:34.848]  And then Mike Adams revealed to me, on air, and to you on air, that he was about to come out today, on Monday, with just that assessment.
[00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:42.715]  We've tried to be very, very conservative about this, tried to not scare people, but the evidence is mounting this is extremely serious.
[00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.079]  So here's a few minutes from that interview.
[00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:51.444]  The full interview is posted at Band.Video with Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com last night.
[00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:52.956]  I've studied it.
[00:06:53.056 --> 00:06:54.136]  I've looked at it at every angle.
[00:06:55.017 --> 00:06:59.241]  Mike's held back a lot and says, well, clearly it's released and they're using it as a power grab.
[00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:01.162]  But it looks like it escaped.
[00:07:01.242 --> 00:07:01.542]  You know what?
[00:07:01.723 --> 00:07:02.663]  I don't think it escaped.
[00:07:02.843 --> 00:07:03.784]  I think they released it.
[00:07:04.145 --> 00:07:05.145]  Now that's speculation.
[00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:06.366]  I'm not saying Mike's wrong.
[00:07:07.187 --> 00:07:13.012]  Either way, you've got all these governments agreeing with each other and they're getting the vaccine, but oh, you got to wait 18 months.
[00:07:13.152 --> 00:07:15.173]  Oh, oh, they're going to hurry it up and have it next year.
[00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:16.755]  This is bad.
[00:07:17.495 --> 00:07:18.496]  And it pisses me off.
[00:07:19.717 --> 00:07:21.018]  And that's where I stand on this.
[00:07:21.058 --> 00:07:21.919]  Mike Adams, what do you think?
[00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:23.366]  I agree with you now.
[00:07:23.806 --> 00:07:25.548]  My assessment has changed in the last week.
[00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:27.610]  I believe this was also a deliberate release.
[00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:30.373]  So that's interesting that you just said that.
[00:07:31.754 --> 00:07:38.521]  I believe that it was introduced, possibly by an agent working in that virology lab in Wuhan, but it was... Oh yeah, I forgot!
[00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:41.464]  Now the scientist who reportedly stole it from Canada is dead!
[00:07:41.484 --> 00:07:42.706]  Yeah, right.
[00:07:42.926 --> 00:07:44.367]  And a bunch of other people are getting killed.
[00:07:44.387 --> 00:07:45.769]  I'm sorry, there's just so many angles here.
[00:07:46.573 --> 00:07:47.073]  No, exactly.
[00:07:47.113 --> 00:07:50.635]  Well, look, this achieves all of the top goals of the globalists.
[00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:51.695]  Think about this.
[00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:53.796]  I don't think anybody's put all these pieces together.
[00:07:53.816 --> 00:07:59.118]  It's not just depopulation, but every government in the world is about to go broke from debt spending.
[00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:00.558]  They need a scapegoat.
[00:08:01.018 --> 00:08:10.662]  Sure would be great to blame a virus for the economic collapse that's about to happen everywhere because of the global debt pyramid that Max Keiser was just talking about an hour ago, by the way, and he's correct on all that.
[00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:12.410]  Also, think about this.
[00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:13.912]  What's driving governments broke?
[00:08:14.012 --> 00:08:22.001]  Entitlement programs to retired people who no longer pay taxes but have huge costs to the governments in terms of Medicare, Social Security, pensions.
[00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:31.231]  If they could come up with a way to kill off mostly elderly people, wow, that would sure save governments of the world, including America, Canada, the UK, China, everywhere.
[00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:35.402]  Billions, I mean hundreds of billions, maybe trillions of dollars over a few years.
[00:08:35.822 --> 00:08:37.764]  What an amazing coincidence that this is happening.
[00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:41.328]  And they get to roll out a medical, martial law, police state.
[00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:48.856]  And they get to censor people who are anti-vaccine, saying that you're responsible for causing all these deaths because you didn't promote the vaccine.
[00:08:49.216 --> 00:08:51.299]  I mean, think about all that this accomplishes.
[00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:54.242]  This is sort of a globalist dream come true.
[00:08:55.094 --> 00:08:59.036]  It hits on all these notes, and that's why I think this is no longer a coincidence.
[00:08:59.337 --> 00:09:00.557]  I don't think it's an accident anymore.
[00:09:00.577 --> 00:09:04.200]  I think it was engineered, and it's made to look like an accident.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.821]  Now, that was last night.
[00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:09.403]  Today, the White House made statements.
[00:09:10.804 --> 00:09:13.005]  Barons put out reports.
[00:09:13.165 --> 00:09:20.249]  Other scientific institutions came out and said, yes, ladies and gentlemen, this virus is mutating.
[00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:20.910]  It's getting worse.
[00:09:21.858 --> 00:09:24.039]  You catch it once, and then you catch it again.
[00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:26.459]  It will cause massive heart attacks.
[00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:30.160]  It will cause people just to collapse in the street, as we've been seeing.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.842]  There's an excellent Zero Hedge article posted on Infowars.com that everybody should go read.
[00:09:35.322 --> 00:09:39.443]  China's coronavirus numbers don't add up, and the White House doesn't believe them.
[00:09:40.282 --> 00:09:50.408]  And then it walks through the numbers of what China previously claimed two months ago and a month ago, and how clearly they were lying about it, and how clearly it is much worse.
[00:09:51.308 --> 00:10:01.774]  And Barron's notes that China's coronavirus numbers are too perfect to mean much when you then look at the current models that they are putting out.
[00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:08.818]  But that really doesn't surprise anybody that the Communist Chinese are very, very famous for putting out
[00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:13.221]  The most ridiculous BS the planet has ever seen.
[00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:18.244]  Again, I covered this in the first segment, but you should go watch the whole nine-minute interview.
[00:10:18.304 --> 00:10:21.006]  It's on Infowars.com, a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:10:21.466 --> 00:10:34.615]  Senator Cotton, China refusing to hand over evidence about Wuhan Biolab that was just a few hundred yards away from the supposed food market where this broke out.
[00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:39.018]  But there's been no evidence that it did break out in this food market.
[00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:45.897]  Clearly, we've never seen a response by governments around the world like this.
[00:10:46.097 --> 00:10:50.023]  Clearly, the virus is extremely communicable, spreads very, very easily.
[00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:55.451]  And now we're seeing deaths in Europe, deaths in Africa, deaths in other areas.
[00:10:57.037 --> 00:11:05.163]  Anyway you slice it, this virus is a big deal because it is being used as a police state communist crackdown in China.
[00:11:05.563 --> 00:11:13.269]  It's being used to basically give China cover to invade and take over Taiwan, who's been winning their dispute with the communist Chinese.
[00:11:13.869 --> 00:11:26.118]  And most importantly, it gives cover, as Mike Adams and I were just talking about earlier from last night's show, to the fact that there's a global Ponzi scheme of fiat currency
[00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:41.017]  And that the globalists see the solution to stopping that Ponzi scheme collapsing is to have a giant war or a giant bioweapons release that they can claim is natural or say it's terrorists released.
[00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:42.501]  I think?
[00:12:02.802 --> 00:12:09.346]  This is the globalist answer to the global awakening of the nation states, to their plan.
[00:12:09.906 --> 00:12:15.269]  And it's clear that this has been cooked up by the UN and Bill and Melinda Gates, who've patented the virus and many others.
[00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:22.713]  That's who benefits, that's who has the history of doing this, and that's whose fingerprints are all over it yet again.
[00:12:23.334 --> 00:12:30.398]  I would encourage listeners to understand that they'll also use this pandemic as it expands, they say for several years,
[00:12:31.328 --> 00:12:42.372]  To crack down on independent press and that you see the Communist Chinese cracking down on press and our own media praising that here because they want to be able to shut down their competition as well and only have one voice.
[00:12:42.392 --> 00:12:45.233]  And that's why Infowars staying on the air is so critical.
[00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:55.937]  So I have a symbiotic suggestion to all of you to get products you need that make your life better and that make you safer and that fund the voice of freedom.
[00:12:56.758 --> 00:12:56.818]  I'm
[00:13:18.416 --> 00:13:24.442]  We also have the high-quality storable food, but I have to tell you, they've extended it out to 10 to 14 days for delivery.
[00:13:24.662 --> 00:13:27.504]  They have the food, but they have to package it and then get it to you.
[00:13:27.584 --> 00:13:29.826]  And the orders aren't going down, they're going up.
[00:13:29.927 --> 00:13:32.929]  So that time may increase soon, like it already has.
[00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:36.873]  I suggest you go to infowarestore.com and lock in your order for
[00:13:37.173 --> 00:13:38.994]  Four weeks, three months, six months a year.
[00:13:39.214 --> 00:13:41.476]  They have wide ranges of high quality food.
[00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:42.936]  They have specialty diets.
[00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:44.797]  The packaging is amazing.
[00:13:45.718 --> 00:13:52.202]  Sealed inside bags inside the plastic tote containers that are sealed that you have to actually
[00:13:52.722 --> 00:13:52.982]  I think so.
[00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:24.012]  Nanosilver toothpaste and the immune gargle at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:14:24.312 --> 00:14:25.333]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:25.353 --> 00:14:25.954]  Please stay with us.
[00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:36.382]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have a bunch of news that I'm going to get through in the next hour of this transmission.
[00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:45.570]  And then we're going to have great guests on, including Jeff Nyquist.
[00:14:46.633 --> 00:14:50.115]  Who is a expert on the coronavirus.
[00:14:51.336 --> 00:14:52.877]  To give us some updates on that.
[00:14:55.258 --> 00:14:57.299]  And to break down some of the most recent news.
[00:14:57.399 --> 00:15:02.802]  But, as I've got all these different stacks of news we're going to cover.
[00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:10.787]  Political news, updates on the Democrat race, updates on the deep state being investigated, or getting away with the crimes.
[00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:15.376]  Update on what President Trump is up to and what he was up to over the weekend.
[00:15:16.337 --> 00:15:18.958]  Cultural news, what the left is doing to society.
[00:15:18.978 --> 00:15:27.060]  The Me Too movement in an epic fail, ignoring the Harvey Weinstein case, now that it's no longer politically advantageous for them.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:40.045]  And then this other set of news over here, which is what the left and the Democrats are getting away with, destroying our cities, destroying our democracy, destroying our justice system.
[00:15:42.523 --> 00:15:49.125]  But I was thinking about this as kind of an intro to getting into all of this news here.
[00:15:50.986 --> 00:15:59.568]  You see, President Trump needs to give a major victory to his supporters.
[00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:00.869]  A real victory.
[00:16:02.369 --> 00:16:03.449]  Now what am I talking about?
[00:16:03.489 --> 00:16:07.151]  You're sitting at home or in your car at work and you're saying, what are you talking about?
[00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:09.752]  Oh, and Trump's already given us a ton of major victories.
[00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:15.134]  Sure, in the game of kicking political footballs back and forth.
[00:16:16.814 --> 00:16:26.898]  Because we can still sit here and debate the economy and the Democrats and the left are still going to say, oh, this is Obama's economy, regardless of whatever the facts are.
[00:16:27.338 --> 00:16:28.039]  That doesn't matter.
[00:16:28.099 --> 00:16:31.700]  That's not a total victory because they're still going to make their claims.
[00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:46.857]  The same thing goes with all the investigations of Trump and the indictments and everything and the arrests of all the Trump associates, and then McCabe gets away and all these other people get away, and still nothing really of the Obama administration.
[00:16:46.977 --> 00:16:58.864]  Now, again, we'll have to be patient and see what happens, but if Trump is in office for four and or eight years and there's no arrests made from the, at least the spying scandal,
[00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:04.514]  Under the Obama administration, but it should go well beyond that into the Clinton State Department.
[00:17:05.514 --> 00:17:10.015]  And beyond, quite frankly, their involvement with the Epstein sex trafficking.
[00:17:13.676 --> 00:17:18.777]  But here's why it's so important for President Trump to really deliver a total victory to America.
[00:17:20.197 --> 00:17:27.799]  And why we're kind of in the balance right now, quite frankly, with Attorney General Barr.
[00:17:28.621 --> 00:17:32.344]  Some things I see and hear from him have me extremely discouraged.
[00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:36.407]  Other things I see and hear from him have me encouraged.
[00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:40.310]  But this is what it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:52.018]  As far as the economy or all these other things are concerned, that'll all come down to election day when Americans vote.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.461]  Because you've got Barack Obama
[00:17:56.462 --> 00:17:59.183]  Who's kept his mouth pretty much shut, by the way, during all of this.
[00:18:03.325 --> 00:18:07.087]  Saying how, thanks to him, 11 years ago, the economy is booming.
[00:18:09.948 --> 00:18:15.131]  And you have every single one of the minions of the Democrat Party out there believing it.
[00:18:18.693 --> 00:18:19.033]  And so...
[00:18:20.287 --> 00:18:21.007]  What am I saying?
[00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:23.108]  What is the victory Trump needs to deliver?
[00:18:23.288 --> 00:18:32.513]  What is the victory that will be a true victory where there can be no debate, there can be no commentary, it's just victory?
[00:18:33.233 --> 00:18:36.755]  Some people cry in the defeat, other people rejoice in the win.
[00:18:36.835 --> 00:18:37.355]  What is that?
[00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.817]  It is the indictment of the Obama administration officials.
[00:18:41.117 --> 00:18:44.919]  Brennan, Clapper, Comey, and yes, Barack Obama himself.
[00:18:47.472 --> 00:18:58.942]  The biggest, most sure victory that President Trump can give America and his supporters is a true investigation into the Obama administration.
[00:19:00.403 --> 00:19:02.865]  Start wherever you'd like, finish wherever you like.
[00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:14.695]  Give the Obama administration, or more specifically, Barack Obama, the same treatment that you have endured as President
[00:19:16.687 --> 00:19:19.068]  Mr. Donald J. Trump.
[00:19:21.268 --> 00:19:27.690]  And only then, only then can America really say they've had a true victory.
[00:19:31.191 --> 00:19:42.614]  Only when there's true justice and all the corrupt criminals that we know, we know them by name, are finally indicted, investigated, and you know what?
[00:19:42.674 --> 00:19:44.094]  Maybe some of them end up in jail.
[00:19:46.889 --> 00:19:47.789]  For the rest of their life.
[00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:53.351]  That's victory.
[00:19:53.411 --> 00:19:54.371]  That's total victory.
[00:19:54.411 --> 00:19:55.492]  That's complete victory.
[00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:02.194]  And it will ensure, because it's real corruption.
[00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:04.634]  I mean, all this stuff against Trump is obviously fake.
[00:20:05.175 --> 00:20:08.756]  The real stuff went on in the Obama years, but even beyond that.
[00:20:09.196 --> 00:20:16.138]  But it's fresh enough, and Obama is still as much of a media darling with them, you know, propping him up.
[00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:29.906]  When or if the truth came out about everything that went on for Spygate, for the Iran deal, in Ukraine, in the Crimea, with Obama's involvement, that's total victory.
[00:20:30.147 --> 00:20:32.309]  And all the left can do at that point is just cry.
[00:20:34.431 --> 00:20:36.313]  Or they can open their eyes and see the reality.
[00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:40.738]  But you see, economies will come and go.
[00:20:43.288 --> 00:20:55.458]  Policies will come and go, approach on the big issues will come and go, but what will stay forever is a real investigation, a real indictment and arrests.
[00:20:58.881 --> 00:21:07.808]  And quite frankly, that's the only way I think you can assure that after President Trump, you'll have another
[00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:11.651]  Call it whatever you want, conservative, populist, whatever.
[00:21:11.811 --> 00:21:22.362]  You'll have another person who's true to their own cause and the cause that the people elected them to have.
[00:21:23.823 --> 00:21:26.085]  Trump's not perfect, but he's trying to be president.
[00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:27.627]  He's not being controlled.
[00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:29.769]  And he's not being controlling.
[00:21:33.769 --> 00:21:38.611]  And so that 110% needs to happen, no questions about it.
[00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:39.811]  It has to be done.
[00:21:43.473 --> 00:21:49.055]  Now I'm gonna get into the nuts and bolts of all that when we come back on the other side of this break.
[00:21:52.756 --> 00:21:59.819]  But I will say this, the only silver lining
[00:22:00.996 --> 00:22:22.103]  In McCabe walking and the rest of these creeps walking like Stroke and Page and them cheersing about it, is that they're the underlings that are just being used like nodes in a network to see the higher-ups, to see the bigger picture, and to go after, as they say, the big fish.
[00:22:22.503 --> 00:22:25.685]  The Brennans, the Clappers, the Comeys, the Obamas.
[00:22:28.325 --> 00:22:29.726]  And I think all of America
[00:22:32.366 --> 00:22:37.612]  Because here's the thing, there is still a large group of people that just throw Trump in with the corrupt D.C.
[00:22:37.932 --> 00:22:39.334]  establishment, corrupt D.C.
[00:22:39.394 --> 00:22:39.875]  politics.
[00:22:40.235 --> 00:22:43.799]  Trump actually locks these people up and says, hey, I'm not part of it.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.902]  Millions of people will come out and vote.
[00:22:46.742 --> 00:22:52.269]  All right, let me get into the nuts and bolts of what I was talking about in the last segment.
[00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:05.257]  Now, last week there were some major developments in the war against the deep state in the mission to drain the swamp.
[00:23:07.158 --> 00:23:09.560]  Obviously you had McCabe walking.
[00:23:10.721 --> 00:23:17.146]  You had Trump intervening, at least with his bully Pulpit in the Roger Stone case.
[00:23:18.207 --> 00:23:24.993]  You had Bill Barr give an interview to ABC in which he criticized the Trump tweets.
[00:23:26.917 --> 00:23:51.646]  But you also had the DOJ say they're going to be investigating the process or the interview, if you will, of General Mike Flynn, where the FBI eventually charged him with lying during that investigation, even though they said he didn't lie.
[00:23:53.595 --> 00:23:57.717]  But let's just stop it right there and now pick it up where we're at today.
[00:23:59.378 --> 00:24:07.943]  Revealed, FBI set up briefing with Trump, Flynn and documented their thoughts for crossfire hurricane operation.
[00:24:09.564 --> 00:24:19.830]  So basically you have all kinds of espionage going on during the Trump campaign and then in the Trump presidency, probably still ongoing.
[00:24:20.629 --> 00:24:24.110]  Honestly, I mean, Brennan and all these guys still have their clearance.
[00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.730]  Ciara Mala still has his clearance.
[00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.471]  I mean, folks, they're still spying on everything the president does.
[00:24:31.452 --> 00:24:33.573]  And think about that, they can't get anything still.
[00:24:36.414 --> 00:24:44.976]  But think about all the different layers of espionage that they had running against Donald Trump and then President Trump.
[00:24:46.203 --> 00:24:52.689]  They had the Spygate tapping his, everything, his phone activity, internet activity, all that was being tapped and tracked and documented.
[00:24:54.731 --> 00:25:00.115]  Then you had them sending in FBI agents, suggesting sending them in undercover with a wire.
[00:25:00.976 --> 00:25:06.321]  You have them saying, we're going to form a emergency plan.
[00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:11.526]  We're going to do everything to stop Trump from inside these bureaucracies.
[00:25:13.027 --> 00:25:19.237]  Setting up Papadopoulos, setting up Stone, setting up Flynn, putting Manafort's head on a pike.
[00:25:23.725 --> 00:25:25.447]  Then they're just doing briefings!
[00:25:27.602 --> 00:25:31.807]  Where they're posing as, let's say Americans.
[00:25:31.987 --> 00:25:32.748]  That's basically what it is.
[00:25:32.788 --> 00:25:46.645]  It's the Democrats or Obama operatives posing as Americans going into Trump meetings to have a real discussion on policy so that they can document that, take that back to their people.
[00:25:48.246 --> 00:26:01.452]  And then figure out what they wanna do in Crossfire Hurricane, which was their spy scandal, sending people in undercover with wires, tapping all the president's or Donald Trump's activity on his phone and on the internet.
[00:26:02.573 --> 00:26:16.480]  So we're talking about every layer of espionage possible, other than them having like Trump's nanny or something spying on them, which who knows, maybe they had that.
[00:26:17.915 --> 00:26:18.696]  I bet they tried it.
[00:26:21.697 --> 00:26:22.758]  But so it's all coming out.
[00:26:22.838 --> 00:26:23.899]  It's all documented.
[00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:32.044]  And this is why Trump must, and it's, but, and okay, but now we get into the gray area.
[00:26:33.365 --> 00:26:36.006]  Because we say Trump must do this, Trump must do this, Trump must do this.
[00:26:36.046 --> 00:26:44.652]  Well, really it falls under, well, it's all under Trump's purview, but it falls under action, at least diplomatically.
[00:26:46.803 --> 00:26:47.883]  With Attorney General Barr.
[00:26:49.164 --> 00:26:52.404]  And of course, what did Barr say last week?
[00:26:52.784 --> 00:26:54.365]  Criticizing the President for his tweets.
[00:26:54.405 --> 00:26:56.265]  Now, I've heard a couple different accounts of this.
[00:26:56.285 --> 00:26:59.986]  Some people say it's Barr throwing Trump under the bus.
[00:27:00.066 --> 00:27:05.847]  Other people say it's Barr saying, hey, when you tweet, the media spins things, comes after me, and it makes it harder for me to do my job.
[00:27:06.087 --> 00:27:07.708]  But even if that's the case, so what?
[00:27:08.908 --> 00:27:10.168]  Yeah, the media is corrupt.
[00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:10.828]  What do you think?
[00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:13.169]  Yeah, the left is out of control.
[00:27:15.083 --> 00:27:20.786]  So Trump has to silence himself because you have a bunch of piranha-like media out there?
[00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:21.887]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:27:22.127 --> 00:27:27.350]  Would you jump into a pool of piranhas that were bloodthirsty and starving?
[00:27:29.471 --> 00:27:30.051]  Of course not!
[00:27:30.792 --> 00:27:32.532]  Well, that's essentially the Democrats right now.
[00:27:33.413 --> 00:27:34.293]  That's their media.
[00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:38.556]  Starving piranhas running around nipping at Trump's heels.
[00:27:40.237 --> 00:27:44.339]  Nipping at anyone within 1, 2, 3 degrees of separation from Trump.
[00:27:45.981 --> 00:27:47.583]  They're starving, piranha-like!
[00:27:50.006 --> 00:27:50.627]  Crazed!
[00:27:54.171 --> 00:27:55.233]  And now here's the problem.
[00:27:56.995 --> 00:28:03.884]  Barr criticizes Trump's tweets, and then, oh, the Republicans jump on board like Mitch McConnell.
[00:28:06.072 --> 00:28:10.174]  And let's go with the angle that, oh, they just don't like the media response to these tweets.
[00:28:10.194 --> 00:28:11.815]  They don't like the media distraction.
[00:28:11.855 --> 00:28:13.396]  They don't like the, oh, it's the media, media.
[00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:14.897]  Quit being afraid of the media.
[00:28:15.177 --> 00:28:17.578]  That's a losing attitude.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.923]  The day you care about what the media says about you is the day you lose for the rest of your life.
[00:28:27.604 --> 00:28:33.767]  And that's how these people treat it because that's the power they've had invested in them.
[00:28:36.325 --> 00:28:38.129]  That's been what they've been able to do for so long.
[00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:46.565]  So Trump not responding to them, Trump not bowing down to them, is why Trump became president and is kicking their ass every day.
[00:28:48.504 --> 00:28:51.485]  Oh, but Barr lays down all Trump's tweets.
[00:28:51.665 --> 00:28:53.345]  Yeah, Trump's tweets are the problem.
[00:28:53.545 --> 00:29:02.607]  Him tweeting out the truth, not the media that lies all day long, not the corrupt stone case with the corrupt judge and the corrupt jury and the corrupt prosecution.
[00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:03.527]  No, not that.
[00:29:03.607 --> 00:29:05.787]  No, we don't hear Barr bitching about that.
[00:29:05.887 --> 00:29:10.048]  Instead, it's Trump's tweets, which has me a little discouraged.
[00:29:14.849 --> 00:29:15.289]  And now,
[00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:18.783]  Let's try to analyze this.
[00:29:19.784 --> 00:29:27.131]  Barr's internal reviews and reinvestigations feed resentment, suspicion inside the Justice Department.
[00:29:28.212 --> 00:29:32.876]  Fearful of Trump's attacks, Justice Department lawyers worry Barr will leave them exposed.
[00:29:34.758 --> 00:29:35.359]  Exposed?
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.063]  Well, I would find all them right now and say, exposed for what?
[00:29:40.924 --> 00:29:41.685]  What have you done?
[00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:47.935]  More than 1,100 ex-Justice Department officials call for Barr's resignation!
[00:29:50.857 --> 00:29:53.579]  Now, this is obviously all contrived.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.442]  The question is, who's involved?
[00:29:58.783 --> 00:29:59.683]  Is Barr involved?
[00:30:03.046 --> 00:30:05.027]  Or are they really afraid of Barr?
[00:30:05.848 --> 00:30:07.729]  They're really afraid of Trump, we know that.
[00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:09.471]  But are they really afraid of Barr?
[00:30:10.471 --> 00:30:10.952]  I don't know.
[00:30:13.015 --> 00:30:18.756]  Quite frankly, at this point I'd say, I'm almost split, but I'd say 51% of me doesn't trust Barr.
[00:30:22.757 --> 00:30:24.337]  And that might even go up right now.
[00:30:24.357 --> 00:30:32.959]  It might have just gone up to 52 or 54 or 55 because if he's going to complain about Trump tweeting but not complain about all the corruption, let me explain something.
[00:30:33.399 --> 00:30:36.580]  When the Department of Justice, when the Attorney General,
[00:30:37.833 --> 00:30:42.375]  Is more concerned over President Trump's tweets than all the corruption that's going on?
[00:30:42.735 --> 00:30:44.856]  Something stinks in DC, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:48.278 --> 00:30:50.498]  So do you trust Barr to do the right thing?
[00:30:52.679 --> 00:31:03.184]  Are all these Justice Department officials calling for his resignation just to try to fluff Barr up like he's a true enemy of the deep state?
[00:31:05.191 --> 00:31:06.572]  Or are they really afraid of Barr?
[00:31:06.812 --> 00:31:09.435]  And what is it they're afraid of being exposed for?
[00:31:10.696 --> 00:31:11.436]  Hmm.
[00:31:12.557 --> 00:31:13.618]  Hmm.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:25.689]  Over a thousand Justice Department officials want Barr to resign over his handling of the Roger Stone case?
[00:31:25.849 --> 00:31:26.730]  Excuse me?
[00:31:28.431 --> 00:31:31.614]  And then they're afraid that they're going to be exposed?
[00:31:33.183 --> 00:31:34.323]  So what does that tell you?
[00:31:34.343 --> 00:31:39.524]  I mean, you know how hard it is to run a rat trap when you're part of any organization?
[00:31:39.984 --> 00:31:40.745]  You know how hard it is?
[00:31:41.945 --> 00:31:43.225]  Because you don't know who to trust.
[00:31:45.346 --> 00:31:48.226]  You know how hard it is to smoke out a rat, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:31:49.927 --> 00:31:51.307]  When there's rats everywhere?
[00:31:51.327 --> 00:31:55.368]  And they've learned how to operate in the darkness?
[00:31:55.688 --> 00:31:56.128]  It's tough.
[00:31:57.389 --> 00:32:08.476]  So, either this is the easiest smoke out ever in the history of the Justice Department, or something else is afoot and they're trying to act like Bill Barr is really a threat to the deep state.
[00:32:08.917 --> 00:32:09.357]  I don't know.
[00:32:10.658 --> 00:32:16.242]  Either way, I'd immediately start investigating these officials calling for Barr's resignation.
[00:32:16.262 --> 00:32:16.922]  Find out who they are.
[00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.872]  And welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to this live Monday transmission.
[00:32:24.972 --> 00:32:31.356]  Owen Schroer will be back in the second and third hour hosting live, and then of course it'll be Gerald Cilente.
[00:32:31.857 --> 00:32:38.561]  I am working on some big projects that we'll be announcing very, very soon, so that's why I'm only hosting part of the transmission today.
[00:32:38.961 --> 00:32:40.742]  Okay, two things I want to hit real fast.
[00:32:40.802 --> 00:32:42.163]  Look at this, dear TV viewer.
[00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:49.725]  Peter Schiff, Alex Jones has capitulated after 10 years of watching the hashtag Bitcoin bubble inflate to $10,000 per coin.
[00:32:49.765 --> 00:32:52.386]  He thinks now the time to urge his listeners to buy.
[00:32:52.786 --> 00:32:54.527]  This is how manias end.
[00:32:54.687 --> 00:32:59.668]  Greedy greed overwhelms reason as people wants too sensible to buy.
[00:32:59.848 --> 00:33:01.789]  Join the party just as it's ending.
[00:33:02.329 --> 00:33:04.610]  Okay, I don't own any Bitcoin.
[00:33:05.939 --> 00:33:08.240]  And I'm not joining the party out of greed.
[00:33:08.701 --> 00:33:21.989]  I have Max Keiser in here and I agree with the technology and independent currencies so that people have freedom outside of the big globalist banks that are literally teetering on the verge of collapse and are trying to pump up
[00:33:22.529 --> 00:33:22.829]  That's all.
[00:33:44.984 --> 00:33:52.529]  And it's just incredible that people try to spin that in another direction when I've been nothing but nice to Mr. Schiff, who's heavily invested, you know, in Communist China.
[00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:55.351]  I'll invite him on with Kaiser for a debate.
[00:33:55.871 --> 00:33:56.652]  We're all adults.
[00:33:56.712 --> 00:33:57.532]  We can have a discussion.
[00:33:59.116 --> 00:34:02.598]  Separately, we're going to play an interview with Max Keiser that we taped last night.
[00:34:02.618 --> 00:34:05.240]  We're going to premiere it here, coming up in T-minus 50 seconds.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.382]  Separately, what do I believe in?
[00:34:07.822 --> 00:34:14.326]  Things like the immune gargle that's got the nanosilver certified to take out these deadly viruses.
[00:34:14.566 --> 00:34:16.428]  We still have it in 3-ounce and 1-ounce.
[00:34:16.448 --> 00:34:17.388]  Get yours before it sells out.
[00:34:17.628 --> 00:34:24.153]  And back in stock, vitamin mineral fusion, super high-quality fruit punch for adults, for children, amino acids, so much more.
[00:34:24.413 --> 00:34:26.654]  One of the best systems you're going to find out there to boost your immunity.
[00:34:26.895 --> 00:34:28.956]  And Ultra 12, this has all been sold out.
[00:34:29.576 --> 00:34:38.902]  The Vitamin Refusion is back in stock, and so is Ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12 you're going to find, taken under the tongue to get maximum absorption.
[00:34:39.142 --> 00:34:41.784]  Tastes great, totally natural for you and your family.
[00:34:42.084 --> 00:34:45.726]  Ultra 12, back in stock at Infowarstore.com.
[00:34:45.986 --> 00:34:52.951]  That's what I invest in, is the patented Nano Silver Super Silver patented toothpaste that's so incredibly popular.
[00:34:53.231 --> 00:34:57.894]  That's the precious metals I invest in, ladies and gentlemen, just like I said Trump would win.
[00:34:58.334 --> 00:35:00.936]  I invest in victory and truth and justice.
[00:35:01.156 --> 00:35:02.698]  Here is Max Keiser.
[00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:07.361]  By the way, when you see his shows on RT, BBC, Al Jazeera.
[00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:07.662]  Yeah.
[00:35:07.782 --> 00:35:08.803]  It's so professional.
[00:35:09.083 --> 00:35:09.543]  Totally.
[00:35:09.743 --> 00:35:12.385]  He comes on the show to misbehave.
[00:35:12.946 --> 00:35:14.207]  By the way, we were having- Because it's weird.
[00:35:14.267 --> 00:35:14.747]  It's Austin.
[00:35:14.787 --> 00:35:15.428]  Keep it weird.
[00:35:15.808 --> 00:35:16.729]  Keep it weird, Austin.
[00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:18.791]  That's the brand from Austin.
[00:35:19.011 --> 00:35:22.313]  We were having a Nerf gun battle earlier.
[00:35:23.274 --> 00:35:25.134]  But I can't, you should let me have one.
[00:35:25.155 --> 00:35:27.675]  So I came back in here, I have two, you have none.
[00:35:27.695 --> 00:35:31.376]  That's how communist China works or an authoritarian state.
[00:35:31.396 --> 00:35:34.197]  I have the guns and you don't have anything.
[00:35:34.237 --> 00:35:39.698]  I have super silver toothpaste, which is as powerful as all your weaponry in fighting the battle against cavities.
[00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:41.499]  Super silver toothpaste.
[00:35:41.579 --> 00:35:45.580]  It's made with something similar to silver and it looks really cool.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:51.221]  And if you use it, a lot of women will stop you on the street and say, hi, I'd like to marry you.
[00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:52.982]  Super Silver Toothpaste.
[00:35:53.062 --> 00:35:53.743]  It's for winners.
[00:35:54.924 --> 00:36:01.951]  Max Keiser is one of the smartest people I know, but when he comes on my show, he goes crazy and has a lot of fun, which is fine.
[00:36:02.351 --> 00:36:05.494]  We had some real moments of genius on the Sunday show.
[00:36:06.587 --> 00:36:20.182]  So I'm asking him, before he leaves, to just spend 5-10 minutes talking about the state of the world, meme warfare, Michael Bloomberg as Mary Poppins, and what he sees coming in the future, the challenges Trump and the American people and others face.
[00:36:20.603 --> 00:36:22.184]  So just a good 5-10 minute rant.
[00:36:22.685 --> 00:36:24.186]  Lord Kaiser, it was great having you here with us.
[00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.830]  Right!
[00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.211]  So, meme warfare.
[00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:32.373]  Yeah, I'll try to extemporaneously speak a little bit about this and how it relates to Mike Bloomberg.
[00:36:32.834 --> 00:36:39.217]  So, Mike Bloomberg is putting out a lot of these crazy memes or images or ads and people are really wondering, what is this all about?
[00:36:39.257 --> 00:36:41.058]  He seems like he's trying to lose.
[00:36:41.618 --> 00:36:49.462]  But, in fact, in meme warfare, it's very subtle because it attacks your subconscious and unconscious mind and it's very disruptive.
[00:36:50.122 --> 00:37:00.849]  And it's a way to get a lot of bang for the buck and to get your face out there in a very pervasive way.
[00:37:01.269 --> 00:37:08.894]  And if you go back to 2016, remember that Hillary Clinton, she was almost what took her under and what
[00:37:09.514 --> 00:37:10.015]  We're good to go.
[00:37:33.178 --> 00:37:41.442]  And she was fell for this trap that was set for her that Pepe the Frog was somehow reflective or representative of Nazism.
[00:37:41.983 --> 00:37:44.624]  And so she started to talk about this.
[00:37:44.844 --> 00:37:51.147]  And it immediately was was the response was, wow, this woman is really is completely out of touch.
[00:37:51.207 --> 00:37:56.050]  It made her look just completely unhinged to have fallen for this.
[00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:57.410]  Here we are in 2020.
[00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.552]  And so Michael Bloomberg, who is a media savvy guy, who's
[00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:01.553]  I think so.
[00:38:17.193 --> 00:38:18.675]  30 million dollars, go do some memes.
[00:38:18.715 --> 00:38:44.355]  So now we're seeing Michael Bloomberg dressed up as Mary Poppins floating above stage saying crazy things and this is because it's an attack on people's subconscious and unconscious mind to get them completely unsettled to rearrange what is familiar and to kind of create a dynamic of I guess you could compare it to Stockholm Syndrome where you know in the Stockholm Syndrome scenario the people who are being held hostage end up kind of
[00:38:45.135 --> 00:38:49.558]  Forming an attachment to the person who's got them held hostage.
[00:38:49.578 --> 00:39:09.050]  They kind of fall in love with the warden in the prison This is something that you see often and this is something that Mike Bloomberg is attempting to do take our Subconscious mind and to to take it To buy it essentially to buy his way into our mind using these weaponized means so when you see
[00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:16.312]  Mike Bloomberg in a situation where it looks really disruptive and crazy and why is he doing this?
[00:39:16.372 --> 00:39:25.535]  Understand that he is trying to attack your subconscious and unconscious mind to get you as unsettled as possible so that you feel helpless.
[00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:36.356]  And when you start to feel helpless, you look for a father figure, you look for someone who can restore order to your sense of helplessness.
[00:39:36.857 --> 00:39:41.941]  And, oh, here's this friendly billionaire guy who's playing as Mike, and Mike can get it done.
[00:39:41.961 --> 00:39:51.148]  And so you start to gravitate, especially people who are unprepared to defend themselves against this, you start to gravitate toward this heroic
[00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:58.364]  Father figure who's going to save you from these weaponized ugly memes that are playing havoc in your in your mind.
[00:39:59.105 --> 00:40:07.973]  So this is I think only going to get weirder because I think other candidates are going to start doing this as well.
[00:40:08.033 --> 00:40:12.957]  So as we head into 2020, you could see the political ad landscape.
[00:40:13.857 --> 00:40:29.847]  Look completely psychotic where it's like watching acid dropping billionaires throwing weaponized memes at each other to try to attack our unconscious mind.
[00:40:30.607 --> 00:40:42.115]  This is, I'd say, an echo of the 1960s when drug use in America became popularized and images in the popular culture became
[00:40:42.975 --> 00:40:44.737]  Hallucinogenic and psychedelic.
[00:40:45.618 --> 00:40:50.862]  And so the music, the album covers at that time, you remember like Jimi Hendrix with the Beatles and the Stones.
[00:40:50.922 --> 00:40:54.726]  It was all rubber soul and all drug induced.
[00:40:54.806 --> 00:40:59.110]  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds with obviously LSD as they're dropping acid.
[00:40:59.971 --> 00:41:04.255]  And then we went into a very serious conservative period in America with Reagan.
[00:41:05.509 --> 00:41:14.095]  And we had the movie Top Gun, the first one, and we became really a conservative-based kind of straightforward messaging.
[00:41:14.595 --> 00:41:23.121]  But now we're back to psychedelia, but it's being weaponized with the use of social media, memes, and billions of dollars behind it.
[00:41:23.461 --> 00:41:27.544]  So this, I think we're really going to see, as the 2020 campaign unfolds,
[00:41:28.104 --> 00:41:41.215]  One of the most dangerously psychotic media environments that will do incredible damage to a lot of people, particularly younger people who are not really mature enough to understand what's going on.
[00:41:41.995 --> 00:41:50.942]  It could damage a whole generation to make them almost impossible to ever have any ability to think for themselves.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:59.702]  That's what people with a lot of power who want more power, they're willing to destroy whoever gets in their way.
[00:41:59.942 --> 00:42:02.162]  In this case, it's going to be a whole new generation.
[00:42:02.482 --> 00:42:06.123]  It's going to be the political process in America, maybe even the Constitution.
[00:42:06.443 --> 00:42:12.125]  But if you know what's going on, maybe you can protect yourself from weaponized memes.
[00:42:12.685 --> 00:42:13.546]  That's it for now.
[00:42:13.686 --> 00:42:14.386]  Bye, y'all.
[00:42:14.566 --> 00:42:14.866]  No!
[00:42:15.267 --> 00:42:15.927]  Don't do it!
[00:42:16.427 --> 00:42:22.131]  I was just... I'm trying to... Just because you didn't buy Bitcoin at a dollar, don't blame me!
[00:42:22.151 --> 00:42:25.713]  I begged you to buy Bitcoin at a dollar, and you said no!
[00:42:26.134 --> 00:42:30.116]  It's a... it's a conspiracy from... from... Get your Bitcoin!
[00:42:30.716 --> 00:42:31.937]  Pirates!
[00:42:32.317 --> 00:42:38.101]  Welcome into Hour 2 of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:42.725 --> 00:42:53.070]  The president attended the American tradition of the Daytona 500 yesterday.
[00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:59.753]  Of course, the left used this as an opportunity to attack Trump, but more specifically, attack his base.
[00:43:00.253 --> 00:43:11.398]  Trump looks to rev up his base at Daytona 500, and you can imagine, oh, the rednecks, the white dudes, the hips, the deplorables that like NASCAR.
[00:43:13.217 --> 00:43:32.107]  There's tens of millions of them, so you can discount them and bemoan them and insult them as much as you'd like, but they make up a large majority of the population, actually, and it has nothing to do with what you think it has to do with.
[00:43:32.127 --> 00:43:38.270]  These are just American-loving patriots that like watching fast cars, and so President Trump
[00:43:39.713 --> 00:43:43.440]  At the Daytona 500 went a little bit like this.
[00:43:51.314 --> 00:43:54.257]  I have been to a lot of Daytona 500s, Chris.
[00:43:54.337 --> 00:43:58.502]  Never have I felt the excitement and energy.
[00:43:58.562 --> 00:44:06.231]  We've had great races on the track, but we've got the President landing right now.
[00:44:06.251 --> 00:44:07.332]  The fans are pumped up.
[00:44:13.318 --> 00:44:15.379]  I mean, wow, what a day.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:21.923]  It's one of the most incredible things I've ever seen.
[00:44:21.963 --> 00:44:24.685]  To see, they said that plane's 800 feet above the racetrack right now.
[00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:27.007]  What an achievement by the President of the United States.
[00:44:27.047 --> 00:44:32.150]  He's the Grand Marshal, and due to command, presidents of course have attended NASCAR.
[00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.611]  Air Force One gets a flyover before the race.
[00:44:36.052 --> 00:44:40.655]  And then, the beast, President Trump's limo, takes a lap.
[00:44:42.142 --> 00:44:43.303]  To get the track warmed up.
[00:44:45.865 --> 00:44:49.728]  Of course, the crowd was just going absolutely nuts.
[00:44:50.088 --> 00:44:50.869]  Massive crowd.
[00:45:04.833 --> 00:45:14.279]  Daytona International Speedway, we love our country and it's truly an honor to be with all of you at the Great American Race.
[00:45:14.779 --> 00:45:24.325]  Gentlemen, start your engines!
[00:45:25.826 --> 00:45:27.627]  And it was a pretty epic day.
[00:45:29.295 --> 00:45:34.057]  At Daytona, and you heard Jeff Gordon on the pre-race commentary.
[00:45:34.077 --> 00:45:38.679]  I believe Jeff Gordon, I mean, I would imagine he's probably won in Daytona a couple times.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:43.441]  He's a famous race car driver, one of the best.
[00:45:44.302 --> 00:45:55.407]  And so for him to say he's never had energy, he's never felt excitement like he felt at this Daytona because the president was there, is really telling.
[00:45:57.389 --> 00:46:11.478]  This is yet another example of how the fake news pretends like the president isn't popular, or pretends like they have any candidate that can even hold a candle to President Trump's popularity.
[00:46:12.679 --> 00:46:16.162]  No one is even close, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:17.763 --> 00:46:19.964]  No one is even close.
[00:46:21.925 --> 00:46:25.548]  And in fact, we've got some updates coming up in the next segment
[00:46:27.452 --> 00:46:42.137]  from the Democrat side of things and the meltdown that they were in, but the recovery process that they are in now and where things go from here.
[00:46:42.197 --> 00:46:54.702]  Of course, we've still got fake news attacking the president and it looks like their next agenda, their next scheme,
[00:46:56.206 --> 00:47:01.411]  To try to remove Trump from office or detach Trump from his base is now afoot.
[00:47:02.171 --> 00:47:03.152]  It's now been revealed.
[00:47:03.252 --> 00:47:04.453]  We'll get to that as well.
[00:47:04.493 --> 00:47:07.296]  This is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[00:47:08.617 --> 00:47:13.441]  Yes, we are into hour two of the Alex Jones Show at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:14.282 --> 00:47:16.124]  Filling in for Alex, I'm Owen Schroer.
[00:47:16.184 --> 00:47:17.425]  I've got updates coming.
[00:47:18.536 --> 00:47:24.719]  From the Democrat side of the aisle, major developments happening last week and over the weekend.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:30.462]  Before I get into that though, I want to point out a couple things that are going on at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:47:31.783 --> 00:47:38.987]  One, you may notice with all of the coronavirus outbreaking as well as other disease,
[00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:55.537]  But specifically the coronavirus, you're going to probably notice soon people marketing super silver or colloidal silver as a way to build your immune system and to deal with even potentially the coronavirus specifically.
[00:47:56.377 --> 00:48:06.801]  And in fact, we won't play their ads, but people are now trying to sell colloidal silver, a bottle of it,
[00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:10.093]  For hundreds of dollars.
[00:48:12.455 --> 00:48:16.518]  One individual, in particular, for $300 a bottle.
[00:48:18.099 --> 00:48:29.528]  Now, at Infowarsstore.com, we're selling the same stuff, certified by government labs, science labs, we've got all the documentation right there.
[00:48:29.548 --> 00:48:32.711]  We've gone over it on air before, I'm not gonna be redundant here.
[00:48:32.731 --> 00:48:35.433]  And we sell it for
[00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:40.008]  10% of the price at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:48:40.789 --> 00:48:46.551]  So, don't be duped by these Johnny-come-latelys, by these fly-by-nighters.
[00:48:46.591 --> 00:48:51.752]  They're gonna come in and sell you some colloidal silver for hundreds of dollars using the coronavirus as the backdrop.
[00:48:52.193 --> 00:48:54.533]  Yes, colloidal silver is a great way to build your immune system.
[00:48:54.954 --> 00:49:03.657]  Yes, colloidal silver's been proven to specifically go after this type of viral infection, like coronavirus or SARS.
[00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.970]  But we don't jack up the price.
[00:49:08.691 --> 00:49:13.073]  We don't try to sell you something beyond the market value.
[00:49:13.554 --> 00:49:14.654]  We do the exact opposite.
[00:49:14.674 --> 00:49:18.316]  We give you the best product at the best price at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:49:18.376 --> 00:49:29.383]  Now, we're sold out of our silver bullet because smart shoppers said, wait a second, I'm not going to spend hundreds of dollars on some bottle of silver when I can go to InfoWareStore.com and get it for 30.
[00:49:32.096 --> 00:49:35.918]  But we also have the immune gargle that still has the colloidal silver in it.
[00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:37.639]  It's just not for consumption.
[00:49:37.679 --> 00:49:39.760]  It's for gargling, keeping your mouth clean.
[00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:42.922]  We also have a spray that you can spray on the back of your throat.
[00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:43.562]  It coats it.
[00:49:43.582 --> 00:49:49.526]  You can even get down into your lungs, help with fighting infectious disease.
[00:49:50.286 --> 00:49:52.347]  But again, not selling it for hundreds of dollars.
[00:49:52.387 --> 00:49:57.090]  In fact, you can get, I think, 10 for still half the price that these other people are selling it for.
[00:49:59.031 --> 00:50:00.912]  So, look at that for yourself.
[00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:04.347]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[00:50:05.247 --> 00:50:10.870]  And then the other great thing going on is Vitamin Mineral Fusion is on sale, but I'll get into that later.
[00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:20.494]  Let me go through the Democrat news right here.
[00:50:22.514 --> 00:50:26.856]  Bloomberg reportedly considering Hillary Clinton as his running mate.
[00:50:27.036 --> 00:50:28.517]  Now let's be very clear.
[00:50:30.934 --> 00:50:38.557]  And I am actually, well, let's just say it's another case of InfoWars is next month's, next year's news today.
[00:50:39.097 --> 00:50:43.598]  I was saying that Bloomberg was a favorite to win the Democrat nomination before he even started running.
[00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:49.300]  That was more just because it was his name being floated as a potential and I knew that the Democrats had nothing else.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.801]  Well, Bloomberg has surged.
[00:50:52.083 --> 00:50:56.686]  And realistically, forget about the polls, forget about all the BS the Democrats run right now.
[00:50:56.746 --> 00:51:00.329]  Realistically, Bloomberg is probably number two now behind Bernie Sanders.
[00:51:00.749 --> 00:51:03.251]  Everyone else in the campaign has pretty much just been lapped.
[00:51:04.131 --> 00:51:04.512]  They're done.
[00:51:06.673 --> 00:51:09.655]  So, why are people speculating this?
[00:51:09.795 --> 00:51:15.419]  Well, because Bloomberg added Capricia Marshall, a Clinton ally, to his 2020 campaign.
[00:51:19.272 --> 00:51:21.334]  What is Bloomberg thinking bringing Hillary in?
[00:51:21.374 --> 00:51:26.858]  Does he think that that political power, that political purse, will be advantageous?
[00:51:26.898 --> 00:51:35.224]  Of course, Hillary, with the ultimate lust for revenge against Donald Trump, trying to get in the White House, obviously we know why she would want to be in.
[00:51:37.646 --> 00:51:42.570]  Plus, she's obviously not healthy enough to do a full-on presidential campaign.
[00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:47.814]  So, maybe they try to slip Hillary in as the VP.
[00:51:50.503 --> 00:51:52.945]  But boy, if you're Bloomberg, do you have a death wish?
[00:51:58.671 --> 00:52:03.075]  So, we shall see about that.
[00:52:03.936 --> 00:52:06.498]  But it's obvious now it's Sanders and Bloomberg.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.161]  And it's kind of reached that point.
[00:52:09.902 --> 00:52:11.483]  You know, we're about to get into March.
[00:52:12.506 --> 00:52:15.428]  And then April, and that's when you pretty much know for sure who the nominee is going to be.
[00:52:15.448 --> 00:52:18.871]  So we've reached the point where you really get it down on the Democrat side to the final candidate.
[00:52:18.931 --> 00:52:20.773]  Is it really going to be Bloomberg-Sanders?
[00:52:21.673 --> 00:52:25.937]  And at that point, you know the Democrats running all afoul.
[00:52:26.637 --> 00:52:34.123]  They don't want Sanders, so they may either just accept Bloomberg for what he is, even though he does seem to be kind of out of the control of the Democrat Party.
[00:52:34.163 --> 00:52:35.224]  So they may be measuring that.
[00:52:35.905 --> 00:52:40.749]  Or do they broker the convention, and then ultimately it's just a total you-know-what show.
[00:52:41.926 --> 00:52:44.687]  But for Bernie Sanders, he's running into some problems now.
[00:52:45.587 --> 00:52:49.848]  Topless protesters storm stage as Bernie Sanders campaigns in Nevada.
[00:52:49.868 --> 00:52:51.028]  This is wild stuff, folks.
[00:52:51.048 --> 00:52:52.868]  This is some wacky, wild stuff.
[00:52:54.409 --> 00:52:59.770]  Women running on the stage with their breasts out, pouring some liquid all over them.
[00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:01.070]  Very odd.
[00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:03.690]  Very, very odd stuff.
[00:53:04.611 --> 00:53:05.951]  Bernie seemed to be enamored, though.
[00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:10.492]  I would imagine anything after looking at his wife is probably pleasant.
[00:53:10.512 --> 00:53:12.072]  Excuse me, I shouldn't be rude.
[00:53:13.153 --> 00:53:18.515]  But so, you've got Sanders getting his campaigns protested.
[00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:25.398]  Sanders had a campaign somewhere, I forget where it was, and someone had a huge Trump banner fly by in the background.
[00:53:26.719 --> 00:53:30.861]  Now the same Russian pranksters that got Adam Schiff
[00:53:31.718 --> 00:53:34.740]  To request nude photos of Donald Trump on the phone.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:42.444]  Now they've got Bernie Sanders in a prank phone call, thinking he's talking to Greta Thunberg, even though he wasn't.
[00:53:44.605 --> 00:53:45.886]  I will be honest though, I listened to it.
[00:53:45.986 --> 00:53:47.807]  It doesn't kind of sound like Bernie.
[00:53:48.247 --> 00:53:49.908]  These pranksters are known.
[00:53:50.048 --> 00:53:52.629]  I mean, they've obviously gotten Schiff and they've gotten others.
[00:53:52.649 --> 00:53:56.971]  I mean, they're well known to do such a thing, but it does not sound like Bernie Sanders.
[00:53:56.991 --> 00:53:57.772]  So I don't know about that.
[00:53:59.184 --> 00:54:02.765]  Sanders and Bloomberg exchange blows as Democrat race heats up.
[00:54:02.825 --> 00:54:08.067]  Yeah, they're basically going after one another now, because again, anybody in reality realizes those are the two frontrunners.
[00:54:09.467 --> 00:54:14.309]  Now the Democrats are going to pretend like there's still a relevancy of a Pete Butt judge or whoever else.
[00:54:14.689 --> 00:54:15.269]  There is none.
[00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:23.252]  Now, coming up next is Nevada.
[00:54:25.973 --> 00:54:26.833]  The Nevada caucus.
[00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:47.483]  And I do believe, guys please double check me on this, I do believe that they're using the same app to count or to measure the results of the Nevada caucus as they did in Iowa, which is a rig job.
[00:54:48.444 --> 00:54:49.945]  Created by former Clintonites.
[00:54:53.287 --> 00:54:54.308]  Created by Soros.
[00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.850]  So.
[00:54:58.993 --> 00:55:07.461]  And maybe that's why they're really pushing Bloomberg in now, or the Democrats just accepting him with open arms now, because they realize they have nothing else.
[00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:14.267]  Even when they rig it for Booty Judge or whoever, they just can't drum up any real support to compete with Sanders.
[00:55:15.368 --> 00:55:24.737]  So look out for that, which means they may shoot Bloomberg up ahead of Sanders in Nevada to really give him momentum.
[00:55:25.964 --> 00:55:33.267]  Speculation swirls around whether Bloomberg will make Las Vegas debate stage, and this will be the ultimate tell right here.
[00:55:36.009 --> 00:55:45.693]  If Bloomberg is on the debate stage, the Democrats have accepted him and will be promoting him from here on out to get the nominee.
[00:55:46.393 --> 00:55:51.856]  If they don't want Bloomberg, they will somehow manage to keep him off that debate stage.
[00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:58.662]  And I guess continue to try to bolster support for Klobuchar or Buttigieg.
[00:56:00.003 --> 00:56:00.944]  But that's your tell.
[00:56:01.184 --> 00:56:06.607]  If Bloomberg makes a debate stage, count it, it's Bloomberg versus Sanders from here on out.
[00:56:07.808 --> 00:56:21.917]  If Bloomberg doesn't make the debate stage, the Democrat spiral into total oblivion will continue, and they'll remain identity-less and struggling for answers.
[00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:31.244]  As we get closer and closer to the 2020 election and for them, the convention in Milwaukee.
[00:56:31.685 --> 00:56:40.510]  All right, when we come back, we're gonna look at some cultural news and how the Democrats on the left are trying to pretend like Obama's economy is a real thing.
[00:56:41.811 --> 00:56:49.496]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's look at some other political and cultural news that is developing.
[00:56:49.536 --> 00:56:52.118]  Now, here are the two attacks
[00:56:53.757 --> 00:57:00.122]  That the Democrats and their media will be waging against Trump in the next weeks, maybe months.
[00:57:01.022 --> 00:57:07.247]  Obviously, the Roger Stone case, his bully pulpit intervention into that is going to be the big one.
[00:57:07.427 --> 00:57:14.993]  They may even try to concoct some new impeachment scam over that deal.
[00:57:16.054 --> 00:57:18.976]  And I don't think Barr is doing the President any favors in that.
[00:57:19.236 --> 00:57:22.699]  And I forgot to mention this earlier when I was actually getting into the weeds of this story.
[00:57:23.848 --> 00:57:27.610]  Trump said, hey, look, I don't control these guys.
[00:57:27.891 --> 00:57:29.872]  I don't control Barr.
[00:57:29.932 --> 00:57:30.652]  You'd be surprised.
[00:57:30.692 --> 00:57:32.193]  He's pretty much out there freewheeling.
[00:57:33.254 --> 00:57:44.941]  Barr pretty much confirmed that in the ABC News interview where he said, actually, I'm glad the president never intervenes in my business, but his tweets intervene in my business because the media gets involved.
[00:57:45.242 --> 00:57:47.223]  Well, that's not Trump's fault that the media is corrupt.
[00:57:47.283 --> 00:57:52.066]  So you can't tell Trump to shut up because other people are corrupt, which is basically what Barr did, in my view.
[00:57:54.824 --> 00:58:01.406]  But that's dangerous, considering basically Barge is not working with or for Trump.
[00:58:03.406 --> 00:58:08.267]  And Trump, at least according to himself, has very little oversight over the situation.
[00:58:10.328 --> 00:58:15.689]  But regardless of that, believe me, the Democrats are looking at another impeachment scam.
[00:58:17.296 --> 00:58:28.744]  And using Trump's bully pulpit of Twitter and the bully pulpit intervention of the Stone Case as their go-to, which would just be incredible if they opened that can of worms.
[00:58:28.764 --> 00:58:30.065]  I mean, how does that even go?
[00:58:30.125 --> 00:58:31.305]  How does that even fly?
[00:58:31.325 --> 00:58:33.007]  And in fact, you know what?
[00:58:33.747 --> 00:58:35.808]  Now that I'm thinking about it, I almost bet they do.
[00:58:37.082 --> 00:58:37.762]  It's the trend.
[00:58:38.803 --> 00:58:45.548]  Everything else that the Democrats do that they think will lead to the removal of Trump or the victory for them, will always blow back on them.
[00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:48.189]  So if they want to open that can of worms, do it.
[00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:51.292]  Because you will be absolutely savaged by the media.
[00:58:51.692 --> 00:58:54.634]  And you will expose Judge Berman Jackson.
[00:58:54.894 --> 00:58:56.575]  You will expose the prosecutors.
[00:58:56.775 --> 00:58:58.256]  You will expose the jurors.
[00:58:58.616 --> 00:59:02.519]  So if the Democrats go down that road, it's only going to expose the story even bigger.
[00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:04.640]  Just like Ukrainegate with Biden.
[00:59:04.821 --> 00:59:06.782]  Just like Russiagate with Obama and Clinton.
[00:59:07.122 --> 00:59:08.402]  So go ahead and go down that road.
[00:59:09.723 --> 00:59:22.645]  But if it's not that road legally, which I do predict they will do, at least momentarily, maybe it'll end up being a head fake, there is a cultural war being waged against the president right now.
[00:59:24.085 --> 00:59:27.906]  And this was promoted all weekend on social media.
[00:59:29.567 --> 00:59:31.147]  This story from the Washington Post.
[00:59:32.025 --> 00:59:33.206]  But not this headline.
[00:59:33.226 --> 00:59:40.211]  The headline that was being promoted on social media was, Trump has turned American students into bullies.
[00:59:41.472 --> 00:59:42.993]  But here's the headline from the Washington Post.
[00:59:43.833 --> 00:59:49.918]  The president's rhetoric has changed the way hundreds of children are harassed in American classrooms.
[00:59:50.558 --> 00:59:51.519]  The Post found.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.482]  And of course the whole thing is about how minorities and
[00:59:57.833 --> 01:00:03.256]  What a POC's and oh and this and oh and that and oh it's all Trump's fault.
[01:00:03.656 --> 01:00:04.437]  He's the one.
[01:00:04.577 --> 01:00:06.218]  So Trump is now being blamed for bullying.
[01:00:06.758 --> 01:00:09.520]  There isn't anything that happens in this country that the left won't blame for Trump.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.681]  Or blame on Trump.
[01:00:15.623 --> 01:00:18.565]  And you know another thing kind of comes into my head just to put it out there.
[01:00:19.758 --> 01:00:31.647]  Anecdotally, but when is this weird notion of the left, it's kind of like the fake feminism, the fake women's empowerment of the left, that's now led to men competing with women and bashing their skulls in, literally.
[01:00:33.488 --> 01:00:39.993]  This whole notion that the left has now pushed that white people in this country are outdated, outnumbered.
[01:00:41.707 --> 01:00:42.528]  By minorities.
[01:00:42.568 --> 01:00:45.671]  Don't you understand you're now turning white people into minorities?
[01:00:46.111 --> 01:00:48.453]  So when do white people start claiming minority status?
[01:00:48.573 --> 01:00:53.998]  I'm telling you, that trend is going to come to fruition within the next five years, if not sooner.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:00.344]  Unless we have a massive change of cultural direction in this country, which we don't.
[01:01:04.966 --> 01:01:05.667]  It's just the same thing.
[01:01:05.707 --> 01:01:13.214]  You can't claim to be the majority to dominate people and then point the finger at your opposition claiming they're the majority.
[01:01:13.234 --> 01:01:14.295]  You see, that just doesn't work.
[01:01:14.455 --> 01:01:15.136]  This doesn't fly.
[01:01:15.356 --> 01:01:24.184]  You can't claim victimhood status as a minority as you posture yourself as the majority.
[01:01:24.204 --> 01:01:27.047]  It just doesn't work.
[01:01:27.227 --> 01:01:29.009]  And so that's just another thing that we're going to see.
[01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:30.030]  But let's get back to the story.
[01:01:31.144 --> 01:01:36.586]  Washington Post, Trump's rhetoric is causing bullying, and it's all exactly what you expect.
[01:01:37.246 --> 01:01:44.189]  Oh, brown people, and oh, Muslims, and everybody, oh, and the gays, and oh my gosh, it's all Trump's fault, they're all being bullied.
[01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:53.898]  But here's how you know, ladies and gentlemen, here's the telltale signs that this is going to be the next big push by the Democrats to demonize Trump.
[01:01:54.218 --> 01:01:58.379]  The fact that this story was promoted, just utter garbage here.
[01:01:58.399 --> 01:02:02.981]  I mean, you know, if you don't know any better, you read this and you're like, oh my gosh, what is Trump doing?
[01:02:03.041 --> 01:02:03.841]  He's a bully!
[01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:07.322]  Oh my gosh, now children are being bullied because of Trump.
[01:02:07.422 --> 01:02:08.422]  Oh, it's so bad!
[01:02:08.843 --> 01:02:10.203]  Now they're trying to kill themselves!
[01:02:10.223 --> 01:02:10.943]  That's what they claim!
[01:02:10.963 --> 01:02:12.304]  That's what they claim in the story!
[01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:16.125]  Kids are trying to kill themselves because of bullying now, because of Trump!
[01:02:17.885 --> 01:02:22.167]  And this story was promoted all weekend long, all over social media.
[01:02:22.407 --> 01:02:28.329]  Not just them promoting it inside the algorithms, they had their army of blue checkmarks promoting it.
[01:02:29.861 --> 01:02:31.242]  I don't know who these people are.
[01:02:31.302 --> 01:02:34.485]  These are just some of the examples, just to show you the onslaught.
[01:02:35.566 --> 01:02:36.147]  J.M.
[01:02:36.287 --> 01:02:41.571]  Reiger, a Washington Post analysis found that Trump's words, yeah, Trump's words.
[01:02:41.651 --> 01:02:42.612]  No, it's just called words!
[01:02:43.353 --> 01:02:44.814]  So did Trump write the dictionary?
[01:02:45.014 --> 01:02:46.235]  Or what are they going to say next?
[01:02:46.736 --> 01:02:51.320]  Trump literally made the entire English lexicon.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:52.701]  It was all Trump.
[01:02:52.781 --> 01:02:54.583]  Trump created English language.
[01:02:56.314 --> 01:03:04.580]  A Washington Post analysis found that Trump's words have been used by students and school staff to bully children more than 300 times since 2016.
[01:03:05.641 --> 01:03:05.861]  Really?
[01:03:05.941 --> 01:03:10.105]  What about the thousands of physical assaults Trump supporters endure because of you?
[01:03:11.105 --> 01:03:11.566]  He goes on.
[01:03:12.006 --> 01:03:16.209]  Three-fourths of the attacks were directed at kids who are Hispanic, black, or Muslim.
[01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:17.730]  Oh, and there it is, yeah.
[01:03:19.832 --> 01:03:22.834]  The Washington Post, they tweeted this out like 100 times.
[01:03:24.264 --> 01:03:28.305]  For educators, the ongoing threat of politically charged harassment is impossible to ignore.
[01:03:29.385 --> 01:03:38.507]  Schools have cancelled mock elections, banned political gear, formed student-led meditation groups, and created committees to develop anti-discrimination policies.
[01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:39.687]  Oh yes, because of Trump!
[01:03:39.707 --> 01:03:39.787]  Oh!
[01:03:40.007 --> 01:03:48.109]  And by the way, I'm probably not going to be able to get through all this, but folks, here's what needs to be done in response to this.
[01:03:49.338 --> 01:03:54.381]  Okay, now if this happens, it probably won't, but I'm giving you, this is the game plan to victory.
[01:03:55.322 --> 01:04:07.228]  All you have to do, if 20 Trump supporters wear a Trump hat to school tomorrow, high school, college, elementary, whatever, 100, and they filmed it, what would happen?
[01:04:07.388 --> 01:04:12.852]  They'd be bullied, they'd probably be physically assaulted, they'd probably be harassed by the staff and the teacher.
[01:04:13.672 --> 01:04:18.015]  I've talked to these people, they send me messages, some of them record it, okay?
[01:04:20.615 --> 01:04:22.837]  The real discrimination is against Trump supporters.
[01:04:22.997 --> 01:04:25.258]  The real bullying is against Trump supporters.
[01:04:25.618 --> 01:04:30.001]  Now, is there bullying of all sorts going on in schools, and are they using words, and are they going to blame Trump?
[01:04:30.261 --> 01:04:30.722]  Okay, yeah.
[01:04:31.762 --> 01:04:33.183]  But that's not what's really happening here.
[01:04:34.124 --> 01:04:42.029]  To sit here and act like Trump haters are being discriminated against is the most unbelievable reversal of reality I can ever imagine.
[01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:44.091]  But that's what they're doing.
[01:04:45.251 --> 01:04:49.915]  Just as Trump has repeatedly targeted Latinos, so too have school bullies.
[01:04:50.788 --> 01:04:54.150]  Alright, I'm not done getting through all of this news, but I need to be very efficient.
[01:05:21.035 --> 01:05:36.903]  Diligent and move quickly through these stories before we're joined by our guest Deanna Lorraine and then Jeff Nyquist an expert to discuss the coronavirus outbreak which incredibly I mean, it's just unbelievable folks.
[01:05:36.923 --> 01:05:45.347]  It almost becomes numbing just how Tomorrow's news today we are and we just it's just like part of the process.
[01:05:45.367 --> 01:05:49.850]  We don't even have time to really reflect on it, but
[01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:54.766]  Here's what else is going on right now with the left politically and culturally.
[01:05:54.826 --> 01:06:05.069]  Now again, this is why Trump has to have a real lasting victory because it's the only way to defeat the brainwashing and the propaganda.
[01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:06.550]  It's the only way.
[01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:14.112]  Now you have Barack Obama on Twitter today taking credit for Trump's economy.
[01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:26.507]  They just released, they've already released numbers, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:26.527 --> 01:06:30.630]  95% of all new jobs during Obama era were part-time or contract.
[01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:38.756]  Now, in the Trump jobs boom, they've been mostly full-time jobs, salary jobs.
[01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:42.431]  But Obama wanted the gig economy.
[01:06:42.591 --> 01:06:43.471]  He talked about this.
[01:06:43.512 --> 01:06:45.994]  He said Americans will just have to accept this is how it is.
[01:06:46.514 --> 01:06:55.402]  Then, when Trump campaigned, saying he'd fix Obama's broken economy, fix Obama's dead economy, then what did Obama say?
[01:06:55.882 --> 01:06:57.023]  Well, what does he have?
[01:06:57.063 --> 01:06:57.724]  A magic wand?
[01:06:57.844 --> 01:06:58.865]  It's just not gonna happen!
[01:07:00.206 --> 01:07:02.128]  Oh, but it did happen, you jackass!
[01:07:03.008 --> 01:07:04.810]  Almost said something even worse than that.
[01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:05.811]  I controlled myself there.
[01:07:05.831 --> 01:07:06.932]  It's just this liar!
[01:07:08.936 --> 01:07:23.243]  This total fraud, this phony Obama, this crap stain on the underwear of America, sits here, takes credit for Trump's economy.
[01:07:23.483 --> 01:07:25.584]  But this is what angers me about it, folks.
[01:07:26.184 --> 01:07:28.245]  His little minions think it's real.
[01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:33.848]  Everything good in the world is thanks to Obama, and everything bad in the world is because of Trump.
[01:07:34.148 --> 01:07:35.849]  That's how brainwashed these people are.
[01:07:37.228 --> 01:07:54.689]  And until the truth about Obama comes out with no doubt, with no room for debate, we will continue to be berated with these lies of who Obama was.
[01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:15.777]  I'm not even sure why this story gets re-brought up, but it's important to remember, but it was on my desk, I said, well, heck, from InfoWars.com, were 18 to 20 CIA sources killed or imprisoned because Hillary Clinton's emails were being hacked in real time by China?
[01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:18.098]  Hacked?
[01:08:18.718 --> 01:08:20.639]  It's like, again, I've made the analogy.
[01:08:20.959 --> 01:08:23.361]  Hillary Clinton was a political whore.
[01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:25.902]  I mean, see, the problem is,
[01:08:26.997 --> 01:08:31.178]  A physical, like an actual woman that wants to be a prostitute or, you know, whatever.
[01:08:31.459 --> 01:08:35.560]  She can only be with, you know, there's a finite amount of guys you can really be with at the same time.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.021]  Hillary just had a wide open email server.
[01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:41.702]  Anybody could get in, hundreds of people, thousands of people, anybody in China.
[01:08:41.722 --> 01:08:48.104]  I mean, she was a, I mean, the biggest, I mean, if she, every STD Hillary Clinton has politically.
[01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:51.485]  I mean, you don't touch that.
[01:08:51.505 --> 01:08:55.667]  I mean, politically, like, I'm not trying to be rude, but politically, seriously, you know, Hillary's got
[01:08:57.242 --> 01:08:59.484]  She looks like she has AIDS.
[01:09:02.126 --> 01:09:03.227]  She's like balding.
[01:09:03.287 --> 01:09:06.749]  She's got herpes breaking out all over herself.
[01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:08.491]  You're like, oh my gosh.
[01:09:09.892 --> 01:09:11.233]  But that's Hillary politically.
[01:09:11.353 --> 01:09:13.334]  She's a political whore.
[01:09:14.175 --> 01:09:16.757]  And now she's trying to latch on to Bloomberg's campaign.
[01:09:18.298 --> 01:09:19.259]  But this is what the Democrats
[01:09:21.461 --> 01:09:22.141]  Let's move on.
[01:09:23.002 --> 01:09:27.626]  Career criminal thanks New York Democrats for law-freeing him after 139th arrest.
[01:09:27.786 --> 01:09:40.717]  Now look, everything that the Trump administration is doing and that people are talking about with criminal reform and all this stuff, it really all just comes down to one thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:42.019 --> 01:09:42.999]  The war on drugs.
[01:09:43.019 --> 01:09:44.541]  That's all it is.
[01:09:45.908 --> 01:09:49.491]  End the war on drugs and that's your criminal justice reform.
[01:09:49.772 --> 01:09:57.158]  The guy caught smoking a joint or blowing a line or all this crap won't be arrested and thrown in jail for non-violent crimes.
[01:09:57.899 --> 01:09:59.380]  There is your justice reform.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:07.408]  Now, this reforming on the back end, case-by-case thing has been proven not to work, quite frankly.
[01:10:09.198 --> 01:10:14.620]  Democrat lawmaker in Alabama proposes bill requiring men to have vasectomies.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:15.580]  Wow!
[01:10:17.001 --> 01:10:28.865]  Of course this is outrageous, but she says, if you're going to have a heartbeat bill to stop children from being murdered, well then we're going to tell men to have a vasectomy.
[01:10:29.665 --> 01:10:29.865]  What?
[01:10:33.237 --> 01:10:35.618]  This is how deranged these people are.
[01:10:36.578 --> 01:10:38.519]  And they say it's all about control of their own bodies.
[01:10:38.859 --> 01:10:39.279]  Here you go!
[01:10:39.399 --> 01:10:40.660]  You want to talk about control of your body?
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:41.620]  Don't have sex!
[01:10:42.641 --> 01:10:43.081]  Wow!
[01:10:43.321 --> 01:10:45.642]  I mean, revolutionary idea!
[01:10:48.743 --> 01:10:48.863]  Oh!
[01:10:49.924 --> 01:10:50.444]  What's this?
[01:10:51.264 --> 01:10:54.566]  Austin, Texas becoming Los Angeles, California right before my very eyes.
[01:10:55.146 --> 01:11:00.648]  Man arrested after threatening to kill children at Austin Church Playground.
[01:11:02.315 --> 01:11:13.504]  Now I'm proud to say our great IT guy, who wears many hats around here, Michael Zimmerman, has started a petition to have Mayor Adler resign, and he's serious about it.
[01:11:15.085 --> 01:11:16.927]  I am sick of that little twerp.
[01:11:18.929 --> 01:11:26.755]  Seriously, folks, let me tell you, I've been in Austin almost five years, and I've seriously watched this city decay right before my very eyes.
[01:11:26.775 --> 01:11:29.117]  I moved to Austin kind of like right after the peak.
[01:11:31.132 --> 01:11:34.716]  On like the bad end of the tech boom, where it's just everybody moving in.
[01:11:35.016 --> 01:11:38.780]  And then the bad end of all these Democrats getting in and then controlling city council.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.622]  And now Austin is just a damn hellhole.
[01:11:40.802 --> 01:11:42.503]  I mean, it's a hellhole, folks.
[01:11:42.584 --> 01:11:43.024]  I'm sorry.
[01:11:44.385 --> 01:11:45.907]  And it could be so beautiful.
[01:11:45.967 --> 01:11:47.128]  It has so much potential.
[01:11:47.168 --> 01:11:47.769]  It really does.
[01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:49.550]  But the Democrats have destroyed it.
[01:11:51.152 --> 01:11:51.993]  I mean, there's just no debate.
[01:11:54.298 --> 01:11:55.919]  Homeless people are killing people.
[01:11:56.239 --> 01:11:58.801]  Homeless people are threatening children with knives.
[01:11:59.101 --> 01:12:00.942]  Homeless people are breaking into cars.
[01:12:01.723 --> 01:12:03.484]  People can't even go downtown anymore.
[01:12:03.584 --> 01:12:04.865]  They're crapping in the streets.
[01:12:05.045 --> 01:12:06.646]  They're urinating in the streets.
[01:12:06.926 --> 01:12:10.148]  It's now become Los Angeles, Texas.
[01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:12.970]  It's heartbreaking.
[01:12:14.911 --> 01:12:16.452]  It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[01:12:17.993 --> 01:12:21.015]  And it's just another example of what Democrats do to cities, but it won't stop them.
[01:12:22.336 --> 01:12:22.957]  It never does.
[01:12:23.783 --> 01:12:26.104]  It never stops the dumbasses from voting for him either.
[01:12:28.066 --> 01:12:29.827]  This is nuts.
[01:12:31.908 --> 01:12:52.021]  Google has decided to not only fund Chunky Ogre trying to get into Congress, now they are funding the Young Turks to the tune of millions of dollars to start their own educational academy on YouTube.
[01:12:53.339 --> 01:12:54.460]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:56.062]  That's right.
[01:12:56.742 --> 01:13:04.891]  The Young Turks is receiving funding from YouTube to launch an online course called the Young Turks Academy.
[01:13:08.915 --> 01:13:15.962]  And they're getting tens of millions of dollars, maybe even hundreds, almost a billion dollars to do so.
[01:13:16.963 --> 01:13:17.143]  Yeah.
[01:13:18.206 --> 01:13:19.887]  That story is in Axios.
[01:13:20.228 --> 01:13:23.170]  And you know why they're funding the Young Turks to do that, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:26.433]  Because they want your kids to do this.
[01:13:27.674 --> 01:13:31.937]  Trans Kids Charity promoted by Starbucks.
[01:13:33.578 --> 01:13:35.440]  It will be promoted by the Young Turks to your children.
[01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:38.574]  They will say anything white people is bad.
[01:13:38.954 --> 01:13:40.094]  They'll promote stuff like this.
[01:13:40.694 --> 01:13:45.236]  Bachelor contestant Victoria F. apologizes for White Lives Matter shoot.
[01:13:45.876 --> 01:13:49.917]  And while you're sitting here saying, well, White Lives Matter shoot, I thought it was okay to be white.
[01:13:50.357 --> 01:13:52.318]  Folks, this wasn't even about white people.
[01:13:52.618 --> 01:13:53.798]  It was about fish.
[01:13:55.499 --> 01:13:56.159]  It was about fish.
[01:13:57.819 --> 01:14:01.040]  She was doing a White Lives Matter campaign for a fish.
[01:14:01.721 --> 01:14:03.441]  Save this fish that is in danger.
[01:14:03.741 --> 01:14:04.802]  Had nothing to do with people.
[01:14:05.462 --> 01:14:05.942]  Doesn't matter.
[01:14:06.932 --> 01:14:07.552]  Still racist.
[01:14:07.752 --> 01:14:08.293]  It's about a fish.
[01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:10.133]  It's about a fish.
[01:14:12.034 --> 01:14:16.295]  The Young Turks Academy, I'm sure, will be promoting having sex with robots.
[01:14:17.476 --> 01:14:18.016]  And porn.
[01:14:18.296 --> 01:14:21.858]  Hell, Chunk Yogurt says go bang, you know, an animal and it's cool.
[01:14:22.618 --> 01:14:23.458]  Literally, he said that.
[01:14:23.478 --> 01:14:25.099]  He promotes bestiality.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.961]  You know, it's okay, he says, to engage in bestiality.
[01:14:31.321 --> 01:14:33.422]  Sex robots may cause psychological damage.
[01:14:33.522 --> 01:14:34.742]  Yeah, so does porn.
[01:14:34.782 --> 01:14:36.383]  What do you think bestiality will do to you?
[01:14:37.401 --> 01:14:39.943]  And then they'll promote the brain chip and say it's good for you.
[01:14:40.524 --> 01:14:44.567]  Scientists switch monkey brains on or off using electricity in experiment.
[01:14:44.607 --> 01:14:51.192]  Now imagine the control they will have over your mind and your brain if you put an implant or a chip in it.
[01:14:51.352 --> 01:14:53.514]  It's lights out, baby!
[01:14:54.435 --> 01:15:00.059]  Well, I'm very encouraged at what I'm seeing on a local level, politically.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:05.464]  I'm seeing a lot of patriots, a lot of Americans, a lot of Trump supporters.
[01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:15.615]  A lot of conservatives that are running for office, obviously fighting an uphill battle against the establishment, but doing it anyway.
[01:15:15.676 --> 01:15:17.096]  This is exactly what we need.
[01:15:17.136 --> 01:15:22.320]  This is exactly how we continue this political revolution that's going on right now.
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:33.583]  And one of those individuals is Deanna Lorraine running out in San Francisco to try to unseat Nancy Pelosi.
[01:15:34.184 --> 01:15:37.085]  In fact, we'll have a little fun with that later on.
[01:15:38.365 --> 01:15:44.047]  But I wanted to bring something up with Deanna Lorraine and also just get her take
[01:15:44.967 --> 01:15:53.073]  On President's Day, I know that she wanted to come on for President's Day and kind of give President Trump a special salute.
[01:15:53.554 --> 01:15:55.875]  And I'm going to ask her a question about a news story that's developing.
[01:15:56.356 --> 01:16:00.379]  Deanna Lorraine, thank you for joining us on this President's Day.
[01:16:01.299 --> 01:16:01.760]  Absolutely!
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.002]  It's an honor to be here on President's Day on InfoWars.
[01:16:05.362 --> 01:16:06.803]  I wouldn't want to spend it any other way.
[01:16:07.024 --> 01:16:08.645]  So thanks, Owen and Alex.
[01:16:09.525 --> 01:16:12.449]  What do you think about the president right now?
[01:16:12.469 --> 01:16:15.854]  I mean, I see him at NASCAR over the weekend.
[01:16:15.874 --> 01:16:20.281]  I see Chiefs players saying they're excited to go to the White House.
[01:16:20.962 --> 01:16:24.767]  I see his approval numbers continue to skyrocket.
[01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:33.494]  I mean, to me, sad the media won't report this, President Trump really is what Obama was reported as.
[01:16:33.934 --> 01:16:36.075]  Trump is the one who cares about Americans.
[01:16:36.435 --> 01:16:38.316]  Trump is the one fighting for economy.
[01:16:38.676 --> 01:16:40.637]  Trump is the one trying to secure the borders.
[01:16:41.037 --> 01:16:44.718]  And quite frankly, the big lie here, Trump is the one that's popular.
[01:16:44.778 --> 01:16:46.239]  Trump is the one that's delivered.
[01:16:46.319 --> 01:16:49.240]  Trump is the one that is the most popular president of all time.
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:57.107]  All these things the establishment media tried to falsely inflate Obama as, which he wasn't, Trump actually is.
[01:16:59.429 --> 01:17:03.133]  Oh yeah, I mean it's incredible because he is the people's president.
[01:17:03.533 --> 01:17:04.694]  You know, he's not bought.
[01:17:05.295 --> 01:17:07.877]  You can't make him do anything that he doesn't want to do.
[01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:15.144]  He truly does things for the people and he bends over backwards for us to have power and for him to
[01:17:15.944 --> 01:17:17.145]  To reduce his power.
[01:17:17.326 --> 01:17:21.609]  You know, everyone says he's a demagogue, you know, he's a dictator.
[01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:30.677]  No, if he was a dictator, he, first of all, would be able to get a lot more done without being handcuffed, you know, by the Congress and by Nancy Pelosi.
[01:17:31.077 --> 01:17:35.261]  But this is a man that is truly for the people and wants to give the power back to the people.
[01:17:35.581 --> 01:17:36.582]  And the results show it.
[01:17:36.942 --> 01:17:41.366]  He is just achieving accomplishment after accomplishment, victory after victory.
[01:17:41.706 --> 01:17:43.448]  And when you just see the crowds roar,
[01:17:44.488 --> 01:17:49.832]  At Daytona 500, people love him and these are the people that are open about it.
[01:17:50.192 --> 01:17:57.898]  I know there are so many people that are slowly breaking their silence or slowly coming around to Trump and they said, I didn't vote for him last time.
[01:17:58.238 --> 01:18:03.301]  I was one of those people that was brainwashed, but I'm gonna vote for him this time and I'm excited to do it.
[01:18:04.482 --> 01:18:06.924]  Well, and I think there's really a story there too.
[01:18:06.984 --> 01:18:08.705]  Again, this is what the media just ignores.
[01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:10.006]  That's a huge story.
[01:18:10.106 --> 01:18:11.207]  I've seen it in my life.
[01:18:12.622 --> 01:18:20.110]  People who were not going to vote Trump, maybe conservatives just didn't want to vote Trump, they kind of had that fear that the media instilled in them.
[01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:23.874]  And then of course the Democrats that wouldn't vote Trump, they believed all the media lies.
[01:18:24.595 --> 01:18:26.276]  Yeah, a lot of Democrats have flipped.
[01:18:27.133 --> 01:18:32.196]  A lot of that has to do with Nancy Pelosi and the type of destructive behavior that the Democrats are exhibiting.
[01:18:33.077 --> 01:18:50.109]  But then also, on the conservative side too, just all the success of President Trump, the sticking to message, getting the results, and being the president that nobody thought he could be, at least from the people that believe the lies about Trump heading into the election.
[01:18:51.365 --> 01:18:53.726]  I'm hearing now more than ever, I'm going to vote Trump.
[01:18:53.966 --> 01:18:55.286]  I didn't vote Trump last election.
[01:18:55.306 --> 01:18:57.507]  People are more energized now to go vote Trump.
[01:18:57.527 --> 01:18:59.187]  Of course, you know what that means.
[01:19:00.008 --> 01:19:08.710]  This is why the Democrats are pushing for all the illegal voting techniques, no voter ID, citizenship for all, driver's license for all, open the borders.
[01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:13.192]  And so you're kind of seeing the formula of how Democrats get into office.
[01:19:13.592 --> 01:19:17.613]  Media campaign smears against their opponent and then illegal voting.
[01:19:19.002 --> 01:19:19.462]  Exactly.
[01:19:19.522 --> 01:19:20.643]  They have nothing else.
[01:19:21.023 --> 01:19:22.123]  They've lost the people.
[01:19:22.143 --> 01:19:23.424]  You know, what do they have?
[01:19:23.504 --> 01:19:24.684]  Free healthcare for all?
[01:19:25.584 --> 01:19:26.365]  What do they have?
[01:19:26.525 --> 01:19:29.226]  You know, hey, you can choose whatever gender that you want.
[01:19:29.286 --> 01:19:29.766]  That's great.
[01:19:29.786 --> 01:19:31.146]  You know, Democrats support that.
[01:19:31.526 --> 01:19:32.367]  Conservatives don't.
[01:19:32.807 --> 01:19:33.847]  What do they have?
[01:19:33.947 --> 01:19:35.068]  They have no message.
[01:19:35.468 --> 01:19:41.810]  Everything that they claim to do, Trump is actually doing, and doing it a hell of a lot better and with less money spent.
[01:19:42.370 --> 01:19:46.314]  You know, he is the president that is restoring patriotism.
[01:19:46.674 --> 01:20:00.448]  And I think as many times as people say that they hate these Trump rallies or they think he's a narcissist or whatever they think because of the Democrats, with enough of this messaging and enough of his accomplishments and that patriotism,
[01:20:00.908 --> 01:20:12.350]  You know, the rockets blasting into the air, the jets, all of the things he does, waving the flags, it sinks into the heart of every American, and at some point, they can't resist it.
[01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:15.290]  You know, it's like having a big jelly donut in front of you.
[01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:18.771]  At some point, you just gotta take it, and this is what they're doing.
[01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:30.133]  They're so tired of this division, and they're so tired of the negative, negative, negative 365 that comes from all of the news networks, except for maybe Fox and InfoWars, of course.
[01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:37.619]  But it's really all negative and they're tired of it and it feels good to be accomplished and to focus on accomplishments.
[01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:42.325]  It feels good to focus on pride in America and they're finally seeing that.
[01:20:42.426 --> 01:20:44.809]  And that's why Trump has to be on Twitter.
[01:20:44.949 --> 01:20:47.232]  That's why Trump has to have his rallies.
[01:20:48.193 --> 01:20:55.837]  You know, for the people out there that kind of hold their nose and take Trump's tweets, he has to be on there to fight the fake news and to put the truth out.
[01:20:56.357 --> 01:21:04.400]  And he has to have rallies so that he can show, look, I get 20,000 people at a rally no matter where I go, upwards of 50,000 sometimes.
[01:21:05.441 --> 01:21:08.742]  The top Democrat, Bernie Sanders, fills a high school gymnasium and that's peak.
[01:21:09.202 --> 01:21:11.743]  And even the liberal media is having to report that now.
[01:21:12.624 --> 01:21:12.824]  Right.
[01:21:13.064 --> 01:21:14.345]  But I want to kind of...
[01:21:15.345 --> 01:21:17.947]  Let's pivot here and get your take on something.
[01:21:17.987 --> 01:21:23.350]  Now, if you recall, when Trump first got in, they started this whole Me Too movement.
[01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:29.653]  It really came out of Hollywood, but using the mainstream media, they tried to somehow project it onto Trump.
[01:21:30.014 --> 01:21:31.715]  And it was really politically inspired.
[01:21:31.735 --> 01:21:33.276]  I think that we all know that now.
[01:21:33.696 --> 01:21:34.616]  Well, it didn't stick.
[01:21:35.017 --> 01:21:37.278]  The Me Too movement didn't get Trump out of office.
[01:21:37.318 --> 01:21:39.559]  It didn't work to detach Trump from his base.
[01:21:39.619 --> 01:21:40.900]  So where did it go?
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:41.921]  What did it turn into?
[01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:44.183]  Well, it's just kind of floated out there.
[01:21:44.443 --> 01:21:45.605]  It was the biggest focus.
[01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:49.609]  Democrats running around with pussy hats on, starting women's marches, all this craziness.
[01:21:49.849 --> 01:21:50.570]  Huge story.
[01:21:50.610 --> 01:21:51.491]  Harvey Weinstein.
[01:21:51.912 --> 01:21:54.495]  Oh, and now we can get Harvey Weinstein and that'll lead us to Trump.
[01:21:54.575 --> 01:22:00.702]  Well, Harvey Weinstein is now in the moment of either getting got or getting off.
[01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:02.303]  Looks like he's going to walk.
[01:22:03.172 --> 01:22:03.893]  No media!
[01:22:04.554 --> 01:22:05.836]  No one talking about this!
[01:22:06.117 --> 01:22:07.459]  Not on the clock coverage!
[01:22:07.519 --> 01:22:08.801]  What happened to the MeToo movement?
[01:22:08.961 --> 01:22:10.463]  What happened to protecting women?
[01:22:10.704 --> 01:22:15.330]  Harvey Weinstein's probably going to get off here and the media is silent!
[01:22:17.014 --> 01:22:17.754]  Well, that's what they do.
[01:22:17.794 --> 01:22:21.216]  They only weaponize women when it benefits them politically.
[01:22:21.276 --> 01:22:25.479]  That's the only time they weaponize women, like with Kavanaugh, like with Trump, right?
[01:22:25.499 --> 01:22:29.281]  Like with every other Republican man or white man, that's what they do.
[01:22:29.661 --> 01:22:31.702]  But in the meantime, here's what happens.
[01:22:32.282 --> 01:22:35.744]  It completely shatters the actual relationship between men and women.
[01:22:36.064 --> 01:22:36.765]  In reality,
[01:22:37.205 --> 01:22:46.629]  So now there's all these repercussions from what happened with their Me Too movement and what happened with how they completely skewered Kavanaugh and President Trump over this.
[01:22:46.969 --> 01:22:48.510]  Now men don't trust women.
[01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:51.671]  Now a lot of men don't want to be alone in the same room with a woman.
[01:22:51.691 --> 01:22:52.811]  And you know, it's funny you bring this up.
[01:22:52.831 --> 01:22:54.252]  Now a lot of men feel like they have to stay apart.
[01:22:54.272 --> 01:22:57.293]  It was Valentine's Day over the weekend and it's funny you bring that up.
[01:22:57.994 --> 01:23:04.316]  You read all these horror stories of people who can't be in relationships or, you know, women that are single and you just can't even believe it.
[01:23:05.016 --> 01:23:05.677]  You're spot on.
[01:23:07.178 --> 01:23:20.993]  I don't know if you can attribute it to one thing, there's a whole factor of things, but no doubt the left's political agenda has added to the destruction of male and female biologically promoted relationships.
[01:23:21.053 --> 01:23:22.294]  I mean, it really has.
[01:23:22.355 --> 01:23:25.138]  I mean, boys and girls growing up, they don't even know what to do.
[01:23:26.095 --> 01:23:31.137]  Yeah, no, it's radical feminism that has destroyed relationships, and now they're paying for it, you know?
[01:23:31.257 --> 01:23:33.898]  And now people don't believe when there's Me Too claims anymore.
[01:23:33.918 --> 01:23:36.619]  They don't believe it because they're the boy who cried wolf, okay?
[01:23:36.659 --> 01:23:37.680]  So this is what's happening.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:45.883]  If they're going to cry Me Too with Judge Kavanaugh, then they need to do the same consistently with their people, you know, with Weinstein.
[01:23:45.903 --> 01:23:47.203]  I mean, this is absolutely insane.
[01:23:47.223 --> 01:23:49.044]  This is why people don't trust the left anymore.
[01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:53.506]  This is why they fall on deaf ears, why people are going to vote for Trump and they're coming around to conservatives.
[01:23:53.766 --> 01:23:56.667]  Because we tell the truth, we're common sense, and they know it.
[01:23:56.787 --> 01:23:58.067]  And they just can't hide anymore.
[01:23:58.087 --> 01:23:59.288]  They can't play the same games.
[01:23:59.688 --> 01:24:00.948]  The jig is up, Democrats.
[01:24:01.068 --> 01:24:01.709]  The jig is up.
[01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:03.609]  Well, it really is.
[01:24:03.749 --> 01:24:09.891]  But, unfortunately, people are still under the control of the Democrats and their media.
[01:24:09.931 --> 01:24:12.472]  They haven't gotten outside of that matrix yet.
[01:24:13.353 --> 01:24:14.873]  But I do think that day is coming.
[01:24:17.654 --> 01:24:19.294]  Will they care about the Weinstein case?
[01:24:19.475 --> 01:24:19.995]  I doubt it.
[01:24:20.335 --> 01:24:25.136]  And I think they'll act like they care once he is basically not charged with anything.
[01:24:25.736 --> 01:24:27.437]  But another story that's developing right now.
[01:24:27.937 --> 01:24:34.599]  Judge takes rare step of allowing elusive Ghislaine Maxwell to be served with lawsuit by email.
[01:24:34.619 --> 01:24:35.579]  So she's in hiding.
[01:24:36.459 --> 01:24:44.682]  And by the way, I saw a bunch of stories of the left criticizing people that believe in Pizzagate or QAnon or all this stuff.
[01:24:45.598 --> 01:24:48.040]  And then they say, it's all about Epstein.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.741]  Why do they have to make it about this other stuff?
[01:24:50.622 --> 01:24:52.743]  We're the ones that talked about Epstein.
[01:24:52.903 --> 01:24:54.064]  Like, that's what it is.
[01:24:54.144 --> 01:24:55.685]  Like, Pizzagate is Epstein.
[01:24:55.725 --> 01:24:56.746]  Like, don't you get it?
[01:24:56.826 --> 01:24:58.587]  Pizzagate is Anthony Weiner.
[01:24:58.827 --> 01:24:59.308]  Hello?
[01:24:59.328 --> 01:25:02.270]  Uh, Laura Sillsby, hello?
[01:25:03.484 --> 01:25:11.166]  Attention customers, attention customers, can I get Pelosi Cevich to the fitting room to meet her party?
[01:25:11.426 --> 01:25:15.307]  Pelosi Cevich to the fitting room to meet her party.
[01:25:15.347 --> 01:25:15.767]  Ha ha!
[01:25:16.367 --> 01:25:18.968]  I got the crew with that one, they hadn't seen that one yet.
[01:25:19.528 --> 01:25:28.030]  I don't know if our guest Deanna Lorraine has seen that one yet, but I mean this is one of the greatest Walmart pranks of all time.
[01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:30.151]  You had some people do a Clinton killed Epstein.
[01:25:31.111 --> 01:25:51.195]  Uh, you had some people, uh, I forget what it was, Clinton killed Epstein, uh, Prince Philip killed Epstein, so anyway, there were some people that did this for the, uh, to troll the Epstein didn't kill himself meme, and so somebody went into a Walmart, went to customer service and said, uh, can you please, uh, call for my friend Pelosi Subbitch?
[01:25:51.915 --> 01:25:53.176]  Pelosi Subbitch?
[01:25:54.076 --> 01:25:55.056]  Here, go ahead and put it again.
[01:25:59.322 --> 01:26:12.686]  I mean, I'm not encouraging people to go to their local Walmart and ask for the customer service to look for Pelosi SaVitch, but I'm also not discouraging it.
[01:26:14.047 --> 01:26:14.667]  I encourage it!
[01:26:16.246 --> 01:26:16.926]  That's hilarious.
[01:26:17.066 --> 01:26:20.148]  I need to give you guys my tape.
[01:26:20.328 --> 01:26:25.670]  I've been doing calls, obviously, calling outreach and phone banking to the District of San Francisco.
[01:26:26.010 --> 01:26:30.172]  And then, of course, I flew my Pelosi for Prison banner again yesterday in San Francisco.
[01:26:30.733 --> 01:26:35.315]  And it's funny, I get about 99% of people that are favorable to it.
[01:26:35.355 --> 01:26:37.355]  They're excited about it and they think it's badass.
[01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:45.079]  But then I get these random calls and I have a couple of voicemails that are hilarious that say that I'm a fascist,
[01:26:45.439 --> 01:26:50.983]  That I need to go to jail, I need to go to a death camp if I want to run as a Republican in San Francisco.
[01:26:51.003 --> 01:26:54.266]  You know, so much for free speech here in San Francisco.
[01:26:54.666 --> 01:27:02.532]  But I need to forward you guys some of these voice messages because they're pretty... Wait, so are you saying it's just like citizens leaving threatening voicemails?
[01:27:03.312 --> 01:27:03.673]  Yes.
[01:27:04.894 --> 01:27:06.875]  Wow, I mean, you take this pretty well.
[01:27:06.935 --> 01:27:07.916]  You're laughing it off.
[01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:10.658]  I mean, you should probably be calling for an FBI investigation.
[01:27:11.673 --> 01:27:15.594]  Well, you know, I mean, they're leaving me voicemails.
[01:27:15.634 --> 01:27:16.974]  I mean, it's their right to free speech.
[01:27:17.014 --> 01:27:19.655]  I guess it reaches a new level when it's death threats.
[01:27:20.135 --> 01:27:21.196]  No, but see, here's my problem.
[01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:22.676]  I'm not mad at you because I do the same thing.
[01:27:22.736 --> 01:27:27.917]  I mean, I can't even get people arrested that cold clock me at a bar on tape and I get their names and everything.
[01:27:28.477 --> 01:27:29.878]  It's just like, this is our problem.
[01:27:31.048 --> 01:27:31.148]  Is
[01:27:48.422 --> 01:27:51.925]  No, all the evidence is that that's the left, that's the Democrats.
[01:27:52.205 --> 01:27:53.947]  So now you're getting threatened.
[01:27:53.967 --> 01:27:55.969]  I mean, you should really make a big deal of this.
[01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:57.871]  You should put all the phone calls up.
[01:27:58.511 --> 01:28:05.037]  The leftists are now calling a woman running for Congress and giving her death threats.
[01:28:06.518 --> 01:28:08.080]  Saying that I need to go to a death camp.
[01:28:09.641 --> 01:28:12.784]  I'm sure CNN will be knocking at your door for the exclusive.
[01:28:13.772 --> 01:28:14.633]  I'm sure they won't.
[01:28:15.293 --> 01:28:16.435]  They want to bury these things.
[01:28:16.755 --> 01:28:25.883]  And the funny thing is, these are people that are like, you know, these are Antifa, or these are sometimes the Bernie Bros, or people that claim that they're for peace, and yet they're utter fascists.
[01:28:26.444 --> 01:28:27.805]  These are violent people.
[01:28:28.326 --> 01:28:30.528]  And yet, you know, the left protects them.
[01:28:31.311 --> 01:28:35.473]  Well, if there was any, you know, just imagine what happened with the Covington kids, right?
[01:28:35.493 --> 01:28:36.914]  The Covington kids and poor this guy.
[01:28:36.974 --> 01:28:40.836]  Thank God, bless his heart, that he's fighting this and he's winning.
[01:28:40.936 --> 01:28:43.758]  But, you know, imagine if that was on the right.
[01:28:43.838 --> 01:28:45.159]  It just never gets covered.
[01:28:45.199 --> 01:28:45.999]  It never gets covered.
[01:28:46.039 --> 01:28:47.440]  So you're right, we do have to.
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.081]  We have to raise our voices about this.
[01:28:49.641 --> 01:28:52.803]  And that's it, we're all, see, we're all the Covington kids.
[01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:54.745]  I mean, they got the big lawsuit.
[01:28:54.766 --> 01:28:58.591]  They were the young kids demonized, obviously, attacked by the media falsely that day.
[01:28:58.611 --> 01:29:00.274]  But, I mean, we're all Nicholas Salmon.
[01:29:00.314 --> 01:29:01.315]  We've all been lied about.
[01:29:01.355 --> 01:29:02.277]  We've all been attacked.
[01:29:04.386 --> 01:29:05.087]  Yeah, we have.
[01:29:05.287 --> 01:29:12.614]  And it's disgusting because we just sit here and we take it and we take it and we take it, and we sometimes even get desensitized to it.
[01:29:12.934 --> 01:29:14.676]  Because it happens so frequently.
[01:29:14.876 --> 01:29:16.337]  We get assaulted so frequently.
[01:29:16.658 --> 01:29:22.223]  You know, on my election night, when I was out on election night voting for Trump and we went to a party, it was 90%, 95 to 99% Democrat.
[01:29:24.825 --> 01:29:26.767]  And I was getting accosted during the night.
[01:29:27.047 --> 01:29:35.234]  You know, I had men coming up to me, men and women, grabbing my you-know-what, saying, oh, you like to have your you-know-what grabbed.
[01:29:35.274 --> 01:29:36.615]  That's why you're voting for Trump, huh?
[01:29:36.895 --> 01:29:38.577]  And I was reporting it to the bartender.
[01:29:38.597 --> 01:29:39.598]  They wouldn't kick them out.
[01:29:39.618 --> 01:29:40.578]  They wouldn't do anything.
[01:29:40.618 --> 01:29:41.099]  Oh my gosh.
[01:29:41.139 --> 01:29:42.040]  And these are the people, yes.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.402]  Just total foul and disgust.
[01:29:44.422 --> 01:29:46.723]  And again, it all comes from lies from the Democrats.
[01:29:46.824 --> 01:29:50.747]  All right, Deanna, how can people support your campaign so you can keep flying that banner?
[01:29:51.491 --> 01:29:53.131]  Yeah, keep flying the banner, absolutely.
[01:29:53.171 --> 01:29:53.832]  I need your help.
[01:29:53.852 --> 01:29:56.472]  Go to my Twitter, Deanna4the4Congress.
[01:29:56.712 --> 01:29:58.833]  You can check out all the videos from yesterday's fly.
[01:29:59.313 --> 01:30:02.894]  And go to my website, DeannaFORCongress.com.
[01:30:04.254 --> 01:30:08.215]  Alright, author and columnist Jeff Nyquist joins me now.
[01:30:08.275 --> 01:30:15.457]  He's been covering the coronavirus and all of the developing and breaking news, of which we have a lot right now.
[01:30:17.527 --> 01:30:20.309]  I'm really not sure where to begin with Jeff.
[01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:25.891]  I almost kind of want to just lay out the latest and then get Jeff to connect the dots here.
[01:30:26.612 --> 01:30:29.073]  But there really is so much to look at here.
[01:30:30.534 --> 01:30:37.377]  You've got it now pretty much going mainstream and of course Jeff wrote the article a couple weeks ago.
[01:30:37.897 --> 01:30:40.878]  Did China's plan to destroy the United States backfire?
[01:30:40.898 --> 01:30:41.339]  Of course the
[01:30:42.179 --> 01:30:44.441]  Man-made bioweapon developed in Chinese.
[01:30:44.502 --> 01:30:45.963]  Was it meant for America?
[01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:52.990]  I think we may have some evidence of this and I don't even know if Jeff's seen this yet, but this comes from the CBP.gov official story.
[01:30:54.292 --> 01:30:59.837]  Dulles CBP intercepts dead birds in passenger baggage from China.
[01:31:00.717 --> 01:31:06.499]  Now there's no explanation as to what these dead birds would be doing, except maybe as food.
[01:31:06.559 --> 01:31:09.139]  But you look at the dead birds, I don't know anybody that would want to eat that.
[01:31:09.179 --> 01:31:11.660]  There's not even any meat on the bones.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.181]  So that's suspicious.
[01:31:13.961 --> 01:31:18.882]  They're trying to find out people that have corona in Hawaii, the origins of that.
[01:31:19.302 --> 01:31:25.084]  Obviously, coronavirus, people that have it are being flown in, detained.
[01:31:25.744 --> 01:31:28.025]  The numbers coming out of China are obviously not
[01:31:29.045 --> 01:31:36.989]  Adding up, but then you have the World Health Organization teaming up with big tech to censor people from sharing news and stories and videos of the coronavirus.
[01:31:37.009 --> 01:31:46.333]  So, Jeff Nyquist, you wrote the article last month, kind of seeing it before, kind of like InfoWars, like, is this a man-made bioweapon from China?
[01:31:46.353 --> 01:31:47.494]  Were they trying to attack America?
[01:31:48.034 --> 01:31:51.596]  What do you make with all the latest news and how do you connect all these dots?
[01:31:52.817 --> 01:31:57.559]  Well, out of the hundreds of cities in China, the COVID-19 virus appears in Wuhan.
[01:31:58.143 --> 01:32:01.905]  Which is the center of their viral biological warfare research.
[01:32:02.565 --> 01:32:04.726]  So what are the odds that it would happen?
[01:32:05.046 --> 01:32:12.790]  And by the way, if this was just something casually, you know, randomly mutating off of animals onto people, why would it have to be in China?
[01:32:13.731 --> 01:32:26.037]  China has a very sophisticated biological warfare program, and I brought up in the article a speech by General Qi Hao Chen, who happened to be the defense minister of China at the time,
[01:32:26.644 --> 01:32:35.472]  This speech was made about 17, 18 years ago to a select level of high party cadres, that's high level Communist Party leaders.
[01:32:36.232 --> 01:32:38.374]  And he was no ordinary general.
[01:32:38.614 --> 01:32:48.022]  As the defense minister, he was also on the Party Military Commission, which oversaw the entire Chinese military system from the point of view of the ruling Communist Party.
[01:32:48.683 --> 01:32:52.226]  And Xi's speech is quite long, quite technical.
[01:32:52.895 --> 01:32:56.437]  And I was able to verify this speech for my own information.
[01:32:56.718 --> 01:33:07.124]  I have over the years concentrated on Russia more than China, but one of my interests is the sociology of mass destruction weapons.
[01:33:07.885 --> 01:33:11.647]  Biological weapons are perhaps the most destructive weapons of human beings.
[01:33:12.368 --> 01:33:17.631]  And this speech by Chi-Hao Chen, when it was translated by Epoch Times in 2005,
[01:33:19.150 --> 01:33:29.536]  At first I was kind of dismissive, but when I got into the details, I found a detail that a Russian defector who worked in China told me in 1999.
[01:33:32.177 --> 01:33:47.186]  Colonel Stanislav Lunev, who had defected from the Russian military, he had been the deputy head of the GRU in the United States at the time of his defection, Lunev told me about
[01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:51.392]  A meeting of the Russian generals in Moscow in early 1992.
[01:33:51.632 --> 01:33:58.155]  They had made a treaty with China for spying on the United States and sharing all intelligence.
[01:33:58.735 --> 01:34:03.938]  And the other thing they had done is that they had a war plan with China.
[01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:10.241]  And of course, the Soviet Union, this was after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which is quite remarkable.
[01:34:11.383 --> 01:34:17.491]  The general said our nuclear war plan against America is still on, only we are not going to invade the lower 48 states.
[01:34:17.631 --> 01:34:18.853]  China is going to do it.
[01:34:19.294 --> 01:34:21.797]  We will invade Alaska and parts of Canada.
[01:34:22.478 --> 01:34:24.922]  And they talked about a division of North America.
[01:34:25.552 --> 01:34:38.567]  between China and Russia, where Russia would get Alaska and parts of Canada, China would get the lower 48 states and I presume other parts of Canada, and other countries would be invited in for looting rights.
[01:34:39.288 --> 01:34:43.173]  And the thing that's significant is that in Xi's speech,
[01:34:44.022 --> 01:34:46.905]  Which appeared in English in 2005.
[01:34:47.365 --> 01:34:55.873]  There is a passage, Chi refers to trading territory in the north with Russia to get the territory we need in the lower 48 states.
[01:34:56.573 --> 01:34:58.034]  Now, maybe I should explain.
[01:34:58.975 --> 01:35:01.618]  Chi begins the speech explaining China's problem.
[01:35:02.338 --> 01:35:06.302]  Overpopulation, severe degradation of the environment from pollution.
[01:35:07.182 --> 01:35:10.025]  They need, excuse me, they need new land.
[01:35:11.593 --> 01:35:12.395]  Where are they going to get it?
[01:35:12.675 --> 01:35:14.458]  He said India, Southeast Asia.
[01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:18.625]  If we try to invade that land, the Americans will oppose us.
[01:35:19.366 --> 01:35:20.308]  Plus there's no room.
[01:35:20.388 --> 01:35:21.450]  It's already too populated.
[01:35:22.233 --> 01:35:23.514]  Well, they don't.
[01:35:23.754 --> 01:35:24.735]  They will depopulate.
[01:35:24.835 --> 01:35:29.277]  But he said that basically it's trivial compared to North America.
[01:35:29.298 --> 01:35:30.698]  That's the best land in the world.
[01:35:31.079 --> 01:35:35.942]  And he said if we have to fight the Americans anyway, we might as well make the land in North America.
[01:35:36.442 --> 01:35:38.543]  And so he said we need to clean up America.
[01:35:38.623 --> 01:35:39.184]  How to do it?
[01:35:39.564 --> 01:35:44.707]  He said a nuclear war won't do because if we have a nuclear war with America, China will be destroyed too.
[01:35:45.408 --> 01:35:47.129]  So what we need to do is a surprise.
[01:35:47.927 --> 01:35:50.728]  Biological attack on America to clean America up.
[01:35:50.788 --> 01:35:52.129]  Those are the words that he uses.
[01:35:52.849 --> 01:36:01.652]  And he said that, you know, he says we communists, you know, we consider ourselves communist humanitarians and it's tragic and America helped China in World War Two.
[01:36:02.052 --> 01:36:10.395]  But it's them or us because they stand in our way and we have to build a second China on a new land to keep China from imploding.
[01:36:10.996 --> 01:36:19.045]  And he talked about this social implosion coming to China from overpopulation, a downturn in the economy, and environmental pollution.
[01:36:19.365 --> 01:36:26.933]  And he said, if this social implosion happens, they will blame the CCP, the Chinese Communist Ruling Party, and we will all be hung as criminals.
[01:36:27.073 --> 01:36:32.359]  And he said, so we have to justify our rule of China by teaching the Chinese people how to go out.
[01:36:33.186 --> 01:36:36.148]  And biological weapons, he said, give us the best chance.
[01:36:36.548 --> 01:36:42.391]  And he mentioned them making already by that time a number of biological weapons.
[01:36:42.852 --> 01:36:50.136]  He talked about genetic engineering of weapons and genetic specific weapons to target specific races or groups of people.
[01:36:51.196 --> 01:36:55.719]  And although he said this technology might be, you know, 20, 30 years in the future, might not be accessible.
[01:36:57.242 --> 01:37:02.125]  But this speech is quite sensational and I believe it's absolutely authentic.
[01:37:02.585 --> 01:37:06.627]  The senior editors at Epoch Times, of course, they know where it comes from.
[01:37:06.667 --> 01:37:10.029]  They know how their paper acquired it from the original Chinese.
[01:37:10.810 --> 01:37:18.094]  They have, Josh, Philip has posted on Twitter the original Chinese text.
[01:37:18.994 --> 01:37:21.195]  If you go to Josh's Twitter feed, you'll find it there.
[01:37:23.016 --> 01:37:25.578]  This is some pretty next level information here and
[01:37:27.116 --> 01:37:39.847]  I don't know how deep you want to go down the path you were on with the, I mean, basically the means to a, what would really be, I guess, World War III or World War IV, depending on which historian you talk to.
[01:37:40.953 --> 01:37:58.879]  With China and Russia invading the West, and I mean, I can't even tell you how much stuff was going through my head when you mentioned about Russia and China, because it was my understanding that China would kind of come in under the guise of the UN.
[01:37:59.439 --> 01:38:03.740]  And those would really be Chinese troops, but under the guise of the UN so that Americans wouldn't freak out.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.442]  But I guess the coronavirus, you know, it would have just ended up
[01:38:10.322 --> 01:38:20.710]  Wiping out large population bases, and I guess they would have figured it didn't matter who or what, as long as the UN was there to kind of mop it up, then China could come in.
[01:38:20.730 --> 01:38:22.632]  I mean, is that kind of your understanding in 30 seconds?
[01:38:23.735 --> 01:38:26.096]  Well, the virus is a precursor weapon.
[01:38:26.136 --> 01:38:28.457]  They would use multiple diseases.
[01:38:28.477 --> 01:38:37.300]  For example, the Russians had bubonic plague, anthrax, and smallpox as their weapon vectors that they manufactured large amounts.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:50.105]  The Chinese, you know, the virus that only kills a small percentage of the population but disables another large part is a precursor for other diseases to be spread that will do more destruction.
[01:38:50.665 --> 01:38:52.146]  We're talking about a... So kind of like a primer.
[01:38:53.075 --> 01:38:54.757]  Yes, like a primer, exactly.
[01:38:54.777 --> 01:38:59.183]  This is the kind of weapon you use to put people in bed.
[01:38:59.203 --> 01:39:02.447]  You know, a sick person requires other people to take care of them.
[01:39:02.968 --> 01:39:09.777]  If you've got a pandemic in which tens of millions of Americans are infected, and this is an illness that you could be hospitalized for three weeks,
[01:39:10.357 --> 01:39:12.299]  You've flooded all the hospitals already.
[01:39:12.599 --> 01:39:14.120]  You've infected medical staff.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:15.721]  You've degraded systems.
[01:39:15.741 --> 01:39:21.965]  You've caused economic panic throughout the country because people, of course, will panic when something like this happens.
[01:39:22.346 --> 01:39:24.547]  It will disrupt many systems in the country.
[01:39:24.867 --> 01:39:26.789]  Then you hit them with something even more lethal.
[01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:36.235]  You hit them with, you know, weaponized... Alright, we gotta go to a break here, but let's actually focus on this and then the large chessboard when we come back with Jeff Nyquist.
[01:39:37.717 --> 01:39:39.578]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let me just tell you this.
[01:39:41.593 --> 01:39:46.254]  You're getting next level information from Jeff Nyquist right now.
[01:39:48.775 --> 01:39:52.516]  I'll be honest, I didn't really expect the interview to go this direction.
[01:39:52.676 --> 01:39:55.116]  I thought we'd more focus on the latest coronavirus news.
[01:39:55.436 --> 01:39:56.617]  That's kind of the backdrop.
[01:39:57.137 --> 01:40:06.359]  But I really want to continue to get into Jeff's mind here on what he was talking about with the land invasion by China.
[01:40:07.379 --> 01:40:14.684]  And how they had reached closed-door agreements with Russia, and I'm sure other nations as well, to launch such a thing.
[01:40:15.505 --> 01:40:16.886]  And there's little signs.
[01:40:16.906 --> 01:40:22.250]  I mean, there's more than just signs, quite frankly, that the public will probably never even be allowed to know.
[01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:33.379]  But there's little signs like the UN trying to move in and like what Jeff was talking about in the last segment with things that the Chinese have said.
[01:40:33.439 --> 01:40:43.368]  Now let's bring it back though to the coronavirus and again the headline in the Epoch Times from Jeff two weeks ago, did China's plan to destroy the United States backfire?
[01:40:44.108 --> 01:40:48.372]  So Jeff, America was really at a point
[01:40:49.844 --> 01:41:02.636]  Where I think that if all the wheels were in motion, and they were just waiting for that last click to send this whole thing into motion, and that last click was, let's just say, we can use it for an example, you may disagree.
[01:41:03.436 --> 01:41:05.498]  The last click was Hillary Clinton getting in office.
[01:41:06.279 --> 01:41:08.541]  And then everything else just falls into place.
[01:41:09.422 --> 01:41:16.088]  Well, when you talk about the coronavirus being a Chinese plan to destroy the United States,
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:43.151]  So do you think that this was intended to be released in the U.S., it's been planned for decades, and somehow, some way, call it celestial intervention, call it incompetence, basically it got released on their own people, and now they're scrambling around trying to contain it in China, and they can't go through with their plans of releasing it here in the U.S.
[01:41:43.591 --> 01:41:45.312]  Jeff Nyquist, break it down.
[01:41:47.110 --> 01:42:07.557]  Well, you know, we don't have proof as yet that it is a weapon, although it, you know, if you look at the probabilities and you look at the evidence that it was manufactured, that it's not a naturally occurring microorganism, I think, you know, it's pretty safe to say that this is a weapon of some kind.
[01:42:08.257 --> 01:42:10.898]  And, of course, they have many that they've been developing.
[01:42:11.451 --> 01:42:20.663]  China has been around the world stealing biological material, stealing information about genetic sequences of virulent microorganisms for years and years.
[01:42:20.863 --> 01:42:21.183]  Why?
[01:42:21.644 --> 01:42:25.769]  Because they want to find the best microorganisms and weaponize them.
[01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:27.772]  And that is part of a
[01:42:28.387 --> 01:42:28.828]  Thank you.
[01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:47.951]  We would collapse basically from the illness.
[01:42:48.111 --> 01:42:51.553]  We see the mayhem in China from this thing right now.
[01:42:52.033 --> 01:42:54.874]  Imagine if you had a number of diseases at once.
[01:42:55.414 --> 01:42:56.835]  All the hospitals overwhelmed.
[01:42:57.375 --> 01:43:00.836]  All of the economic actors panicking.
[01:43:01.317 --> 01:43:04.358]  The political centers not knowing what to do or how to cope.
[01:43:04.918 --> 01:43:06.899]  This as a beginning.
[01:43:08.034 --> 01:43:09.195]  of an attack on the U.S.
[01:43:09.235 --> 01:43:22.362]  Of course, we know from Russian literature on how to open nuclear war, they have something called the preparatory period, in which they do diversionary attacks through intermediaries, terrorists controlled by intermediaries.
[01:43:22.662 --> 01:43:24.123]  This is called Great Terror.
[01:43:24.263 --> 01:43:25.864]  We're already in that phase of it.
[01:43:26.404 --> 01:43:34.769]  Great Terror is diversionary because we're not focused on Russia and China, we're focused on Muslims in caves that supposedly are going to nuke us.
[01:43:35.487 --> 01:43:52.562]  And then you had testimony from people like Colonel Stanislav Lunev saying, look, we searched for locations in the United States to stockpile nuclear and biological weapons in advance of a war so that, you know, that's arms caches, also arms caches for troops coming into the country.
[01:43:53.251 --> 01:44:04.238]  And of course, what he told me was the model for invasion is Hitler's invasion of Norway, where your troops enter as tourists, or they're already here as students, or they maybe cross over from Mexico.
[01:44:04.579 --> 01:44:10.943]  They go to the arms caches, they get their uniforms, they get their weapons, or the nuclear weapons with which they can attack our cities.
[01:44:11.733 --> 01:44:17.780]  I think from my frustration from years of studying is that we just trade with China.
[01:44:18.261 --> 01:44:22.866]  We just trade with Russia and these countries that mean to do us real serious harm.
[01:44:22.906 --> 01:44:24.989]  Their leaders do, not their people, but their leaders.
[01:44:25.529 --> 01:44:27.512]  We trade with them and we open ourselves up.
[01:44:27.912 --> 01:44:30.135]  Do you realize that most of our vitamins are made in China?
[01:44:30.595 --> 01:44:35.257]  Oh yeah, it's like 95% of the source material and pharmaceuticals is from China.
[01:44:35.617 --> 01:44:38.158]  I mean, I don't know the percentage of the goods manufactured.
[01:44:38.178 --> 01:44:39.398]  I mean, everybody knows about that.
[01:44:40.018 --> 01:44:50.582]  And really, at the end of the day, I mean, we can blame foreign policy, but at the end of the day, I mean, this comes down to business leaders that are using China for their cheap labor in order to make a quick buck.
[01:44:50.742 --> 01:44:56.244]  But let me just kind of stop there for a second, if you don't mind, and just draw back because you brought up the Middle East.
[01:44:56.984 --> 01:44:58.004]  What is the connection there?
[01:44:58.044 --> 01:44:59.345]  Because, I mean,
[01:45:00.735 --> 01:45:12.358]  I don't know your opinion on this matter, but to me, like you said, us being sitting here distracted really, focused on the Middle East, saying that the boogeyman's hiding in a cave, saying that the Muslims are our biggest enemy.
[01:45:13.079 --> 01:45:24.582]  To me, this is just bad foreign policy, and then bad actors get involved and take advantage of these wars, figure out how they can get rich off of these wars, and engage in all sorts of nefarious activity.
[01:45:25.262 --> 01:45:28.663]  And so China's been watching this, obviously Russia's been watching this.
[01:45:28.943 --> 01:45:39.846]  Did they view that as a, that foreign policy, call it whatever you want, corrupt, weak, whatever, did they view that as a weakness that they could kind of use as a distraction to come in and invade?
[01:45:41.206 --> 01:45:46.828]  Look, it's very bad to take the baits and be diverted by an enemy diversionary attack.
[01:45:47.549 --> 01:45:49.210]  You've heard of Alexander Litvinenko.
[01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:59.374]  He was the Russian who was poisoned in London with polonium by the Russian special services, died horribly of radiation poisoning, named Putin as his assassin.
[01:46:00.594 --> 01:46:05.176]  The British investigators traced the radiation on Lufthansa back to Moscow.
[01:46:05.276 --> 01:46:07.697]  They know this radioactive material came from Russia.
[01:46:08.097 --> 01:46:08.778]  They poisoned him.
[01:46:08.838 --> 01:46:09.718]  Why did they poison him?
[01:46:10.305 --> 01:46:14.666]  In 2005, the year before, Litvinenko gave an interview.
[01:46:14.926 --> 01:46:16.907]  Now, he's a defector from the FSB.
[01:46:17.047 --> 01:46:19.908]  He worked under Putin when Putin was head of the FSB.
[01:46:20.548 --> 01:46:24.769]  Litvinenko said that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the head of al-Qaeda, was trained in Russia.
[01:46:25.429 --> 01:46:26.109]  Why did he know?
[01:46:26.129 --> 01:46:35.912]  He knew because he was responsible for maintaining the secrecy of Ayman al-Zawahiri being in Russia in the mid-90s, being trained by the Russian special services.
[01:46:36.713 --> 01:46:51.962]  The fact is, is that, that, that Liveneckel claimed that Al-Qaeda was this kind of diversionary attack, that Al-Qaeda, that many of the leaders in Al-Qaeda were Russian agents, and that Russia was using this, terrorism, as a way to attack the West.
[01:46:52.623 --> 01:46:54.364]  I've developed other sources.
[01:46:54.764 --> 01:47:00.407]  Viktor Suvorov, another GRU defector, wrote about this in a book called Spetsnaz.
[01:47:00.647 --> 01:47:05.610]  It was published in the UK in 1987 in a chapter called Spetsnaz's First World War.
[01:47:05.650 --> 01:47:19.498]  He talked about this great terror in which the West would seemingly be attacked by terrorist forces, but that these forces would be controlled by Russia through intermediaries with no direct connection to Moscow that you could trace.
[01:47:20.186 --> 01:47:33.293]  All of these things came to pass and the reason it's called the preparatory period is that they have to divert our intelligence resources and our military resources to actors and regions that are not them.
[01:47:34.016 --> 01:47:38.818]  So that they can build up their weapons, which they've been doing, by the way, since 9-11.
[01:47:39.238 --> 01:47:42.860]  Russia and China have gotten very strong, so that the balance of power is tipped.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:51.143]  Maybe you saw the article put out about the Russian and Chinese submarines, that the Navy's saying, well, we don't know in a war we could control our own water.
[01:47:51.183 --> 01:47:53.004]  Pause it right there, because we're about to go to a break.
[01:47:53.424 --> 01:47:56.245]  But I want to use this opportunity to say something that's so important.
[01:47:56.585 --> 01:47:59.348]  Or so important for President Trump in America right now.
[01:47:59.468 --> 01:48:01.791]  This is why we need to get out of the Middle East, folks.
[01:48:02.231 --> 01:48:10.541]  Because other countries having international meetings use that to say, look at all the harm they're doing in the Middle East.
[01:48:10.581 --> 01:48:11.702]  We have to do something about it.
[01:48:11.842 --> 01:48:14.445]  I mean, folks, we got to get out of the damn Middle East.
[01:48:14.505 --> 01:48:15.166]  It's killing us.
[01:48:16.630 --> 01:48:21.072]  All right, we brought Jeff Nyquist on, his story from the Epoch Times.
[01:48:21.672 --> 01:48:23.513]  Did China's plan to destroy the U.S.
[01:48:23.773 --> 01:48:24.433]  backfire?
[01:48:24.874 --> 01:48:27.595]  Ended up being next week's news today, so we bring him on for that.
[01:48:27.635 --> 01:48:39.820]  It's kind of diverted from the coronavirus news into a foreign policy thing, but how it ties into the coronavirus, could it be a biological weapon that was intended for the United States by China?
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.161]  We're kind of laying that backdrop.
[01:48:41.901 --> 01:48:50.284]  So let's kind of go back into that foreign policy discussion and then just get your final thoughts and comments on the coronavirus before we let you go.
[01:48:50.324 --> 01:49:01.507]  But I'll just say this, you know, I don't necessarily trust British intelligence when it comes to the polonium poisoning of that individual.
[01:49:01.887 --> 01:49:03.327]  But I do know this.
[01:49:05.859 --> 01:49:16.974]  Chinese have been looking at America as weak for a while, and obviously with your intelligence and your research, had plans to even come in and invade and take it down.
[01:49:16.994 --> 01:49:19.958]  The Middle East foreign policy has been
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.143]  One big giant hoax is the best way I could describe it.
[01:49:25.884 --> 01:49:27.125]  A giant boondoggle.
[01:49:27.585 --> 01:49:33.151]  Russia sees that, doesn't like it, and so they just want to see it end.
[01:49:33.171 --> 01:49:36.534]  I don't even think politically they have any interest between the United States and China.
[01:49:36.614 --> 01:49:38.616]  They just want to see the corruption in the Middle East end.
[01:49:39.096 --> 01:49:39.416]  Okay.
[01:50:00.336 --> 01:50:05.359]  Us talking about China creating a bioweapon to be released in the United States, which is coronavirus.
[01:50:05.819 --> 01:50:08.961]  Which, did it get accidentally released in China or how did that go down?
[01:50:09.001 --> 01:50:15.545]  So, just kind of respond to that with the foreign policy backdrop and then bring it back to the coronavirus.
[01:50:17.306 --> 01:50:18.927]  Well, China is a communist country.
[01:50:19.127 --> 01:50:21.569]  The ruling ideology of China is communism.
[01:50:23.082 --> 01:50:36.773]  Mao Zedong is the chief ideologist, and as Bill Gertz reported in his latest book, Deceiving the Sky, no other Chinese leader since Mao has embraced the rigid orthodox communist ideology more than Xi Jinping.
[01:50:37.653 --> 01:50:44.459]  So we should not be fooled by this slick capitalist exterior of communist China.
[01:50:44.499 --> 01:50:45.480]  It's a communist country.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.083]  We also should not be fooled by Putin's act.
[01:50:50.464 --> 01:50:51.785]  The collapse of the Soviet Union
[01:50:52.532 --> 01:50:53.052]  We're good to go.
[01:51:07.074 --> 01:51:11.676]  Their formation of an alliance with Communist China is not the only Communist alliance they have.
[01:51:12.016 --> 01:51:14.477]  There are military advisors in Communist North Korea.
[01:51:14.917 --> 01:51:19.238]  The Russians are building bases in Communist Nicaragua under Daniel Ortega.
[01:51:19.619 --> 01:51:20.859]  They're allied with Cuba.
[01:51:20.939 --> 01:51:24.240]  There are Russian and Chinese troops in Venezuela right now.
[01:51:24.881 --> 01:51:25.961]  Why do you think they're there?
[01:51:26.401 --> 01:51:31.583]  Why is Russia helping all the Communist countries in South Sahara Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa?
[01:51:32.228 --> 01:51:37.153]  Why are they arming South Africa, which is ruled by the ANC, which is a communist front?
[01:51:37.754 --> 01:51:41.577]  The fact of the matter is, is that communism and the communist bloc still exists.
[01:51:41.998 --> 01:51:43.980]  It was not destroyed in 1991.
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:46.522]  The fall of the Berlin Wall was only a setback.
[01:51:46.542 --> 01:51:48.244]  It wasn't the destruction of communism.
[01:51:48.886 --> 01:51:50.167]  And they have nuclear weapons.
[01:51:50.547 --> 01:51:52.689]  Right now they have more nuclear weapons than they do.
[01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:58.072]  China and Russia are big powers with big abilities to destroy other countries.
[01:51:58.132 --> 01:52:02.735]  In fact, only China and Russia have the ability to destroy the United States.
[01:52:03.056 --> 01:52:07.899]  Which, by the way, they really think they could win, I think, in a war.
[01:52:08.039 --> 01:52:12.782]  I think that Trump trying to re-bolster the military and give it the morale is his response to that.
[01:52:13.202 --> 01:52:18.066]  But I want to just take you back for a second because you're saying you think the
[01:52:19.166 --> 01:52:24.791]  The matchup with China and Russia is there from the beginning and it has communist ties.
[01:52:25.051 --> 01:52:34.238]  As where I'm saying, I look at Russia as just a nation still searching for its role in the world order, still trying to figure out its role in the world order coming out of communism.
[01:52:35.018 --> 01:52:40.723]  And you're saying no, the communists in Russia are no doubtedly teamed up with China.
[01:52:42.144 --> 01:52:46.387]  Two and a half years ago was the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[01:52:47.128 --> 01:53:02.411]  At that time, Russia hosted, at Sochi, the World Conference of Youth and Students, which is a communist organization which has been hosted in different communist countries since World War II, and Putin was the keynote speaker.
[01:53:03.051 --> 01:53:04.652]  You can find this speech online.
[01:53:05.252 --> 01:53:11.453]  Putin says that he believes in them, they are the future, he is behind them.
[01:53:12.754 --> 01:53:13.815]  These are communists.
[01:53:14.335 --> 01:53:18.278]  They're all waving communist flags, wearing communist t-shirts.
[01:53:18.878 --> 01:53:23.622]  This is a massive communist youth organization from all around the world.
[01:53:24.142 --> 01:53:25.683]  This is the speech that Putin made.
[01:53:26.283 --> 01:53:35.350]  Putin has told at meetings with journalists that he never got rid of his party card, that he wasn't a communist because he had to be to be in the KGB.
[01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:39.913]  He has said publicly that he was a communist because he likes communist ideas.
[01:53:40.976 --> 01:53:45.157]  The fact of the matter is that Putin does the same thing Stalin did.
[01:53:45.857 --> 01:53:48.478]  Stalin famously rode a horse in two directions.
[01:53:48.978 --> 01:53:58.161]  That is, he could appear to be a nationalist, a Russian nationalist, when he had to be during the Great Patriotic War, but he was also a communist.
[01:53:58.621 --> 01:54:05.243]  And when in 1943 the Soviet Union dissolved the Comintern, it was a deception.
[01:54:05.683 --> 01:54:08.944]  Just like when they supposedly dissolved it after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:54:09.505 --> 01:54:13.028]  They're still supporting, all around the world, communist regimes.
[01:54:13.128 --> 01:54:16.291]  There are still communist takeovers and revolutions happening.
[01:54:16.751 --> 01:54:20.515]  More recently, Nepal and Nicaragua, the communists have taken over in those countries.
[01:54:20.815 --> 01:54:22.116]  We know about Venezuela.
[01:54:23.297 --> 01:54:24.698]  There's different African countries.
[01:54:24.738 --> 01:54:26.860]  The Congo had its revolution in the late 90s.
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.462]  What do you mean communism is dead?
[01:54:29.042 --> 01:54:30.064]  Who won the Angolan Civil War?
[01:54:30.084 --> 01:54:33.249]  Well, I'll just say this because I want to give you time to finish up on the coronavirus.
[01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:36.955]  Just to put it out there, and I think this is a good debate, maybe we could even have it.
[01:54:37.455 --> 01:54:39.599]  I just disagree with you on Russia's stance.
[01:54:39.859 --> 01:54:43.785]  I just think Russia is searching for identity and I think, quite frankly,
[01:54:44.486 --> 01:54:49.051]  The biggest drive of where they were going was because of the Middle East foreign policy.
[01:54:49.071 --> 01:54:50.232]  The United States now corrupt.
[01:54:50.292 --> 01:54:50.932]  That was.
[01:54:51.673 --> 01:54:55.257]  And I think they'd be open-minded to maybe go a different way if we could clean that up.
[01:54:55.297 --> 01:54:56.278]  But that's my opinion.
[01:54:56.938 --> 01:54:58.239]  Your research tells you something differently.
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:03.845]  But in the last two minutes here, just what do you think was behind the coronavirus?
[01:55:04.045 --> 01:55:05.527]  Where do you think it goes next?
[01:55:06.267 --> 01:55:08.830]  And what do you think the audience needs to know?
[01:55:09.858 --> 01:55:18.564]  Well, the thing to watch for, already in the Russian press, there are accusations that this is a biological weapon made by us put against China.
[01:55:19.084 --> 01:55:28.731]  China is hinted at this when the Chinese Foundation of Science and Technology put out a piece saying that this virus is specifically targeted at Asians.
[01:55:29.429 --> 01:55:36.151]  So we have to watch to see if this propaganda is amplified because this is very dangerous pre-war propaganda.
[01:55:36.531 --> 01:55:49.035]  Blaming the United States for attacking China with a biological weapon would be a justification for them actually using some of their more nasty stuff on us, especially once we get hit by the coronavirus because it's coming to us.
[01:55:49.555 --> 01:55:51.836]  This thing is as contagious as the common cold.
[01:55:52.543 --> 01:55:54.144]  It is not going to be contained here.
[01:55:54.164 --> 01:55:57.687]  It is going to break out for every person that we know has it.
[01:55:57.727 --> 01:56:01.510]  There's probably three to four people walking around spreading it.
[01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:06.534]  People can be asymptomatic for up to 24 days, they're saying now.
[01:56:06.954 --> 01:56:08.895]  There's no way you can contain something like this.
[01:56:09.316 --> 01:56:11.377]  So we are going to have this virus too.
[01:56:11.497 --> 01:56:12.138]  It's going to be here.
[01:56:13.271 --> 01:56:14.612]  Well, and it already is here.
[01:56:15.893 --> 01:56:17.574]  So, I mean, that's already reported.
[01:56:17.614 --> 01:56:18.555]  I mean, it's already here.
[01:56:18.595 --> 01:56:21.758]  In fact, they're looking for somebody in Hawaii who they think may have it.
[01:56:22.678 --> 01:56:24.180]  So, it's already floating around here.
[01:56:26.121 --> 01:56:32.586]  But, I mean, as far as evidence is concerned, I've seen none that show it was made in the U.S.
[01:56:32.646 --> 01:56:33.587]  or came from the U.S.
[01:56:36.389 --> 01:56:36.630]  Yeah, no.
[01:56:37.642 --> 01:56:42.147]  That people are going to you know, this is a we're in a propaganda war.
[01:56:42.187 --> 01:56:46.551]  We've been in a information war with China and Russia for decades and decades.
[01:56:47.692 --> 01:56:50.255]  A lot of the negative messages that appear in our press.
[01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:53.719]  about ourselves come from their agent networks.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:04.828]  Influence operations are a very big part of what they do, trying to get us to turn on ourselves, to divide and conquer us, to try to split us.
[01:57:05.569 --> 01:57:07.931]  This is typical tactics by the communists.
[01:57:08.011 --> 01:57:09.492]  I mean, it's a very old game.
[01:57:10.152 --> 01:57:17.018]  And we have to be aware that some of the messages coming through our own newspapers and radio and television
[01:57:17.586 --> 01:57:21.147]  Are coming from people who are bought and paid for by China and or Russia.
[01:57:21.307 --> 01:57:25.388]  Yeah, 100% and that's been proven in cases like Dianne Feinstein.
[01:57:25.869 --> 01:57:27.969]  Alright, Jeff Nyquist, thank you so much.
[01:57:27.989 --> 01:57:31.590]  You'll have to come on again and maybe even with Alex to talk about this stuff.
[01:57:31.771 --> 01:57:33.171]  Jeff Nyquist, thank you so much.
[01:57:33.551 --> 01:57:33.931]  Thank you.
[01:57:34.391 --> 01:57:37.552]  And you know, like you said, there's so much disinformation.
[01:57:37.572 --> 01:57:43.214]  I mean, Russia has their fake news too, just like the United States has their fake news and we're just trying to figure out.
[01:57:43.254 --> 01:57:45.715]  But the next couple of weeks will tell us what's going on with coronavirus.
[01:57:46.834 --> 01:57:49.676]  It's tough for me to, uh, turn off classical music.
[01:57:51.137 --> 01:57:52.178]  And rock music, really.
[01:57:52.198 --> 01:57:54.901]  I need music with instruments, actually.
[01:57:57.863 --> 01:58:04.508]  But it's almost kind of perfect, like, we're sitting here talking about, you know, deadly outbreak, bioweapons, like, why not, you know?
[01:58:05.249 --> 01:58:06.430]  Have that in the background.
[01:58:07.291 --> 01:58:08.412]  Makes you feel good, right?
[01:58:09.492 --> 01:58:13.696]  Alright, I got some other news to get to before I'm gonna hand it over to Gerald Cilenti, but, but...
[01:58:15.765 --> 01:58:39.825]  With my discussion, which really turned into a foreign policy discussion, I think, more than anything, with Jeff Nyquist, and then just thinking about it during the segments, talking about it with some of the crew here during the break, it is so important geopolitically, it cannot be understated, it's long overdue, it is so important geopolitically for the United States to get out of the Middle East, folks.
[01:58:42.076 --> 01:58:45.597]  And I'm not going to sit here and act like I know what that means or have the answers.
[01:58:45.657 --> 01:58:49.298]  But we have to make that a priority now.
[01:58:49.438 --> 01:58:50.959]  Trump needs to make that a priority now.
[01:58:51.019 --> 01:58:51.819]  And he's hinted at it.
[01:58:52.379 --> 01:58:53.459]  We've seen some signs of it.
[01:58:54.279 --> 01:58:56.360]  We are withdrawing troops.
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:57.240]  It's not enough.
[01:58:58.701 --> 01:58:59.601]  And you have to understand.
[01:59:02.625 --> 01:59:12.714]  Again, I'm not justifying it, I'm just telling you how the grandmasters think, how the people moving the pawns and the knights and the rooks and the bishops on the chessboard are thinking.
[01:59:14.436 --> 01:59:24.325]  If you're Russia, and you've got all this land and these resources, and you're kind of still figuring out your identity in the world, what you are, who you are,
[01:59:26.710 --> 01:59:28.871]  I don't think it comes down to communism or capitalism.
[01:59:28.911 --> 01:59:47.817]  I think it comes down to who are my allies, who have been my allies, and what moves can I make or be involved in that give me a better place in the world order and helps my allies.
[01:59:47.877 --> 01:59:53.519]  And if you're Russia and you're sitting here looking at the two world superpowers, America and China,
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:58.382]  Well, for the last couple decades, the answer has been obvious for Russia.
[01:59:58.422 --> 01:59:59.383]  It's been China.
[02:00:00.464 --> 02:00:02.225]  And they have been plotting with China.
[02:00:02.585 --> 02:00:04.366]  And there have been plans for invasion.
[02:00:05.387 --> 02:00:09.910]  But see, that's why... I mean, folks, it's literally unbelievable.
[02:00:10.090 --> 02:00:12.512]  If Hillary Clinton would have won, the doors would have been wide open.
[02:00:12.532 --> 02:00:14.133]  We'd probably already be invaded by China by now.
[02:00:15.434 --> 02:00:15.754]  Seriously.
[02:00:16.555 --> 02:00:17.515]  That's how close it was.
[02:00:19.317 --> 02:00:21.118]  That's probably why she's trying to get back in.
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:24.000]  So...
[02:00:25.683 --> 02:00:45.367]  We have to get the troops out of the Middle East because you gotta understand, if you're Russia or any other country that really doesn't have a say in the world order, but folks, the invasion of the Middle East by the United States was based off lies, okay?
[02:00:45.427 --> 02:00:52.848]  The lies of 9-11 and the lies of weapons of mass destruction, the framing of Osama bin Laden as a CIA asset,
[02:00:54.318 --> 02:00:59.301]  And then just the continuance of that in the Obama years for whatever reason, even though he claimed he was against it.
[02:01:01.582 --> 02:01:06.365]  That's been... I mean, you can sit here and talk about China all day long.
[02:01:06.866 --> 02:01:08.106]  China's no saint, believe me.
[02:01:10.268 --> 02:01:12.009]  But my point is, if you're Russia...
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:21.382]  With all the doings of the United States and the Middle East, you're going to side with China on the international scale.
[02:01:21.882 --> 02:01:22.943]  It makes more sense for you.
[02:01:23.763 --> 02:01:35.627]  Now if the United States changes its foreign policy, doesn't want to bomb and invade the Middle East all the time, all of a sudden now Russia
[02:01:37.614 --> 02:01:42.957]  It makes more sense for them to be allied with the United States instead of the communist Chinese.
[02:01:42.997 --> 02:01:48.961]  That is, of course, if they don't want to fall back into the destructive pattern of communism, which they're fighting out of.
[02:01:51.603 --> 02:01:52.563]  So this is all going on.
[02:01:52.623 --> 02:01:53.384]  This is all key.
[02:01:54.965 --> 02:01:56.546]  And this is the real game, folks.
[02:01:57.406 --> 02:01:57.686]  All right.
[02:01:57.727 --> 02:02:01.029]  Now, I got other news and stuff I got to get to, including a Michael Bloomberg video.
[02:02:03.250 --> 02:02:04.751]  Look, I'm telling you,
[02:02:08.092 --> 02:02:17.055]  This Nevada caucus is going to be very telling as far as, is Bloomberg going to get the nominee, or are the Democrats going to fight him on it?
[02:02:18.555 --> 02:02:22.757]  And having Hillary Clinton's name involved with Bloomberg now is an interesting plot twist.
[02:02:23.797 --> 02:02:26.258]  We knew Hillary Clinton would get involved in some way, shape, or form.
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:34.562]  Democrat candidates are clamoring for Bloomberg to be on the debate stage with him.
[02:02:34.582 --> 02:02:34.642]  Why?
[02:02:35.522 --> 02:02:44.764]  Well, because Bloomberg has said some pretty, if you're a Democrat, bad things in the past that they love to use against you, including this video that has just surfaced.
[02:02:44.844 --> 02:02:49.546]  Bloomberg bashes farmers, blue collar workers as primitive idiots.
[02:02:49.886 --> 02:02:50.406]  Here's the tape.
[02:02:51.533 --> 02:02:52.794]  And we could teach processes.
[02:02:52.874 --> 02:02:57.615]  I could teach anybody, even people in this room, so no offense intended, to be a farmer.
[02:02:58.336 --> 02:02:59.076]  It's a process.
[02:02:59.116 --> 02:03:02.877]  You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn.
[02:03:03.258 --> 02:03:04.778]  Then we had 300, you could learn that.
[02:03:05.138 --> 02:03:08.220]  Then you have 300 years of the industrial society.
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:14.082]  You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank, and the direction of the arrow, and you can have a job.
[02:03:14.102 --> 02:03:15.843]  And we created a lot of jobs.
[02:03:17.743 --> 02:03:21.325]  98% of the world worked in agriculture today.
[02:03:21.385 --> 02:03:22.825]  It's 2% in the United States.
[02:03:23.985 --> 02:03:26.426]  Now comes the information economy.
[02:03:26.967 --> 02:03:35.710]  And the information economy is fundamentally different because it's built around replacing people with technology.
[02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:41.432]  And the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze.
[02:03:42.072 --> 02:03:44.713]  And that is a whole degree level
[02:03:46.085 --> 02:03:46.527]  Different.
[02:03:47.170 --> 02:03:49.120]  You have to have a different skill set.
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:50.607]  You have to have a lot more gray matter.
[02:03:54.767 --> 02:03:58.989]  So he's had that video and some other videos to stop and frisk.
[02:03:59.009 --> 02:03:59.609]  So here's the deal.
[02:03:59.689 --> 02:04:04.672]  The Democrats basically are going to turn on to Bloomberg what they were never able to get on Trump.
[02:04:05.412 --> 02:04:07.073]  He's going to end up being a racist.
[02:04:07.193 --> 02:04:08.814]  He's going to end up being all these things.
[02:04:09.834 --> 02:04:11.595]  And he's probably going to stand there and fight him.
[02:04:11.615 --> 02:04:15.337]  But it's going to be interesting to see this infighting go down inside the Democrat Party.
[02:04:16.017 --> 02:04:17.538]  And now they're going to start aiming it at Bloomberg.
[02:04:18.178 --> 02:04:19.219]  But I'm telling you right now.
[02:04:21.144 --> 02:04:24.606]  Bloomberg is now the odds-on favorite to get the Democrat nomination.
[02:04:26.827 --> 02:04:29.768]  And I don't think all the attacks on him are going to work, folks.
[02:04:31.469 --> 02:04:32.109]  I really don't.
[02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:34.811]  They didn't work against Trump.
[02:04:35.931 --> 02:04:46.036]  I don't think they're going to work against Bloomberg, because when you get down to it, when you get on that debate stage, and when you look at the individuals and their resumes, Bloomberg's going to mop the floor with them.
[02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:56.444]  Amy Klobacher puffing herself up on national news saying she can't wait to get at Bloomberg on a stage.
[02:04:56.964 --> 02:05:01.687]  No offense, sweetheart, but Bloomberg is a mountain compared to you.
[02:05:01.747 --> 02:05:02.907]  You're like a molehill.
[02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:09.751]  This is going to be interesting, and I'm telling you, Hillary getting her hands in there, she sees the tea leaves.
[02:05:09.791 --> 02:05:11.372]  She thinks Bloomberg is number one, too.
[02:05:13.410 --> 02:05:20.273]  Go ahead, they're going to bring up all the crap from Bloomberg's past and call him racist and this and homophobic and that and this and that.
[02:05:20.793 --> 02:05:21.653]  It's not going to matter.
[02:05:22.393 --> 02:05:24.114]  It will not matter, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:24.294 --> 02:05:30.857]  What will matter is when he gets on the debate stage, it'll be the number one rated debate.
[02:05:31.897 --> 02:05:33.738]  The media will see that and run with it.
[02:05:34.775 --> 02:05:48.948]  The Democrats will see that and either choose to run with it or choose to try and throw Bloomberg under the bus like they've done Sanders and then go to a brokered convention, and that will be probably at the measurement of they don't want Hillary Clinton involved.
[02:05:49.389 --> 02:05:50.570]  But I don't think any of it's going to matter.
[02:05:50.830 --> 02:05:57.056]  Bloomberg has the cash, Bloomberg has the pedigree, and Bloomberg has the stage presence.
[02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:00.499]  And he is now the frontrunner, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:02.748 --> 02:06:13.813]  Yeah, Bernie Sanders is still technically the frontrunner, but you add in some of the variables, like the Democrats not wanting him, and imagine Bernie in the debate.
[02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:19.935]  It's just not going to be good when he actually has to debate somebody that's had success in the world, has actually worked.
[02:06:21.456 --> 02:06:22.656]  It's not going to be pretty for Bernie.
[02:06:24.277 --> 02:06:25.758]  But you can see what's going on.
[02:06:26.698 --> 02:06:30.900]  Whether contrived or not, all the Democrat candidates are now aimed at Bloomberg.
[02:06:32.298 --> 02:06:36.740]  Bloomberg is outspending all of them, except Tom Steyer, but he's really irrelevant anyway.
[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:41.082]  It's almost like Tom is trying to make amends for all the global warming he thinks he caused or something.
[02:06:43.944 --> 02:06:47.285]  So that's what's about to go down in the Democrat debate.
[02:06:47.705 --> 02:06:50.867]  A couple other headlines before we hand it off to Gerald Selenny in the next segment.
[02:06:51.467 --> 02:06:54.529]  Virginia government rejects gun ban after Democrats defect.
[02:06:56.442 --> 02:07:02.284]  They've now delayed that bill to ban ARs and other things to next year.
[02:07:02.624 --> 02:07:04.045]  So that did not go through.
[02:07:04.525 --> 02:07:05.785]  They'll delay it till next year.
[02:07:06.546 --> 02:07:11.488]  Judge takes rare step of allowing elusive Ghislaine Maxwell to be served with lawsuit by email.
[02:07:11.508 --> 02:07:12.468]  So she is hiding.
[02:07:13.708 --> 02:07:15.229]  She is hiding, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:16.876 --> 02:07:26.740]  And they're just looking for her so they can bring her in and ask her questions about this industrial-level sex trafficking ring that she was involved with.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:30.662]  Alright, I'm gonna hand it over to Gerald Cilenti when I come back.
[02:07:30.722 --> 02:07:36.904]  You know, I forgot to say though, one of my favorite supplements at InfoWarsTore.com is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:07:37.024 --> 02:07:38.485]  I drink it every morning, folks.
[02:07:39.895 --> 02:07:44.197]  You're not probably getting all the vitamins and everything you need in your diet.
[02:07:44.497 --> 02:07:48.898]  So if you drink the Vitamin Mineral Fusion every morning, which I do, you just knock it out.
[02:07:49.199 --> 02:07:53.840]  You get the vitamin A, B, C, D. I mean, it's just, it's all in there.
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:55.141]  It's at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:07:55.161 --> 02:07:56.141]  It's back in stock.
[02:07:56.181 --> 02:07:59.342]  It's on sale with vitamin B12.
[02:07:59.923 --> 02:08:02.103]  Makes a great drink to start your morning with.
[02:08:02.203 --> 02:08:06.205]  I'm telling you, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, vitamin B12 from InfoWarsTore.com every morning.
[02:08:06.985 --> 02:08:09.006]  All right, I'm gonna hand it over to Gerald Cilenti.
[02:08:11.115 --> 02:08:17.501]  And then I'm going to go stomp some heads listening to Ludacris.
[02:08:17.541 --> 02:08:18.081]  No, I'm just kidding.
[02:08:18.121 --> 02:08:19.302]  I'm not a violent person, okay?
[02:08:19.382 --> 02:08:19.863]  Relax.
[02:08:20.263 --> 02:08:23.586]  It's just, I mean, how can you not just want to crush them?
[02:08:24.807 --> 02:08:25.147]  All right.
[02:08:26.188 --> 02:08:26.849]  Let's go.
[02:08:27.469 --> 02:08:29.931]  Just let's laugh at the left real quick.
[02:08:29.951 --> 02:08:33.634]  These liberals that are just so fake, they'll fall for anything.
[02:08:33.694 --> 02:08:34.655]  I mean, you know, you're right.
[02:08:34.675 --> 02:08:35.876]  Hey, gullible in the sky.
[02:08:35.936 --> 02:08:37.077]  The average liberal says, where?
[02:08:37.658 --> 02:08:37.838]  What?
[02:08:39.261 --> 02:08:41.622]  They fell for Michael Avenatti's bullcrap.
[02:08:43.123 --> 02:08:48.967]  I mean, folks, I mean, they literally fell head over heels for Michael Avenatti's bullcrap.
[02:08:49.407 --> 02:08:56.952]  Here's a compilation of the Democrats praising the now, well, soon-to-be criminal Michael Avenatti.
[02:08:58.140 --> 02:09:00.322]  He's Donald Trump's worst nightmare.
[02:09:00.382 --> 02:09:01.363]  Michael Avenatti!
[02:09:01.603 --> 02:09:03.045]  Joining us once again is Michael Avenatti.
[02:09:03.065 --> 02:09:04.246]  Let's bring in Michael Avenatti.
[02:09:04.266 --> 02:09:04.887]  Michael Avenatti.
[02:09:04.947 --> 02:09:05.687]  Michael Avenatti.
[02:09:05.727 --> 02:09:07.309]  Michael Avenatti, thank you very much.
[02:09:07.329 --> 02:09:08.971]  He's out there saving the country.
[02:09:08.991 --> 02:09:11.313]  Don Meacham says he may be the savior of the republic.
[02:09:11.353 --> 02:09:13.355]  You are something of a folk hero now.
[02:09:13.615 --> 02:09:15.617]  I owe Michael Avenatti an apology.
[02:09:15.657 --> 02:09:17.199]  I've been saying enough already, Michael.
[02:09:17.219 --> 02:09:18.200]  I've seen you everywhere.
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:19.241]  What do you have left to say?
[02:09:19.261 --> 02:09:20.682]  I was wrong, brother.
[02:09:20.822 --> 02:09:22.244]  You have a lot to say.
[02:09:22.264 --> 02:09:25.687]  I am just dying to hear what you think.
[02:09:25.707 --> 02:09:26.648]  These people all like you.
[02:09:26.889 --> 02:09:30.993]  I'm the only person right here Donald Trump fears more than Robert Miller.
[02:09:31.033 --> 02:09:35.578]  We think you guys are the tip of the spear that's going to take down Donald Trump.
[02:09:35.618 --> 02:09:36.639]  Michael Avenatti's a beast.
[02:09:37.385 --> 02:09:38.146]  Okay, that's true.
[02:09:38.446 --> 02:09:39.207]  He's a beast.
[02:09:39.347 --> 02:09:40.007]  He's a beast.
[02:09:40.067 --> 02:09:43.110]  I hand it to her, and I hand it to Michael Avenatti.
[02:09:43.130 --> 02:09:47.734]  He has a bigger calling here, that being a lawyer is minimal compared to what he's doing.
[02:09:48.014 --> 02:09:53.359]  No one has talked tougher directly to Donald Trump on TV than Michael Avenatti.
[02:09:53.559 --> 02:09:56.561]  And Donald Trump is afraid to mention his name.
[02:09:56.581 --> 02:09:57.742]  That's fascinating.
[02:09:57.822 --> 02:09:59.344]  Donald Trump is terrified.
[02:10:00.184 --> 02:10:03.106]  He has no doubt created sheer panic in Donald Trump's very fragile mind.
[02:10:16.513 --> 02:10:20.454]  Michael Avenatti is laying down the law as guest co-host.
[02:10:20.695 --> 02:10:23.656]  And is he really thinking about running for president?
[02:10:23.936 --> 02:10:28.137]  One reason why I'm taking you seriously as a contender is because of your presence on cable news.
[02:10:28.177 --> 02:10:31.479]  You look at the field of Democrats right now and Avenatti's the one who stands out.
[02:10:31.559 --> 02:10:36.941]  If they decide they value a fighter most, people would be foolish to underestimate Michael Avenatti.
[02:10:37.041 --> 02:10:38.781]  I have always said that they need a fighter.
[02:10:38.841 --> 02:10:40.902]  Look, I mean, we're going to continue to use the media.
[02:10:40.982 --> 02:10:42.683]  I think we've used it with great success.
[02:10:43.496 --> 02:10:44.737]  Yeah, you have, buddy.
[02:10:45.398 --> 02:10:46.679]  Yeah, you have.
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:57.891]  Well, I don't know what the punishment is for all the counts of extortion that Michael Avenatti is now being charged with.
[02:10:59.192 --> 02:11:00.934]  And I also don't know if you can run from jail.
[02:11:02.242 --> 02:11:02.682]  Interesting.
[02:11:02.722 --> 02:11:05.143]  That'll be a tough one for the Democrats to try to figure out.
[02:11:05.783 --> 02:11:08.404]  As, well, I guess not the Democrats, more the media.
[02:11:08.424 --> 02:11:10.764]  I mean, what a bunch of jackasses.
[02:11:10.824 --> 02:11:11.844]  Gerald Selenny with me now.
[02:11:12.465 --> 02:11:25.308]  If there is ever one thing that you can sit here and expose the media as total jackasses, I think the praise of Avenatti and then his utter downfall is the perfect example.
[02:11:26.688 --> 02:11:28.329]  That's why I call them prostitutes.
[02:11:28.869 --> 02:11:29.909]  They get paid to put out.
[02:11:30.748 --> 02:11:35.310]  They get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and Washington lawmasters.
[02:11:36.051 --> 02:11:37.131]  So that's all they're doing.
[02:11:37.171 --> 02:11:39.372]  They're repeating the garbage that's fed to them.
[02:11:40.133 --> 02:11:54.000]  And we can see what low lives they are, and that's why people have to listen to Infowars and Alternative Media, Trends Journal, so that you get the truth in what's going on, rather than the agendas that these little low lives are selling.
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:00.443]  What stupid, imbecilic remarks that you guys and women just played of
[02:12:01.036 --> 02:12:11.550]  How great this Avenatti was, and all that he meant, and all that he's doing, and what his real goal in life is, and what a bunch of crap.
[02:12:12.191 --> 02:12:18.520]  And these are the people that are crapping it out every day, on the air, and a station near you.
[02:12:19.693 --> 02:12:20.354]  It's unbelievable.
[02:12:20.374 --> 02:12:21.695]  They've been totally exposed.
[02:12:22.355 --> 02:12:23.937]  And you know what's sad, though?
[02:12:23.957 --> 02:12:25.057]  They feel no guilt.
[02:12:25.077 --> 02:12:30.742]  They feel no embarrassment for all the fake news and all the BS and propaganda they engage in.
[02:12:30.902 --> 02:12:31.803]  It's really sick.
[02:12:32.283 --> 02:12:35.506]  And we laugh at these people for the jokers they are.
[02:12:35.806 --> 02:12:41.411]  But at another level, these are really sick people that are the enemy of truth and freedom.
[02:12:41.511 --> 02:12:41.871]  All right.
[02:12:42.472 --> 02:12:43.413]  Gerald Salenti.
[02:12:44.033 --> 02:12:50.718]  He's taken his super male vitality and he's ready to boogie with you for the next hour, final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:50.758 --> 02:12:53.460]  Thanks everybody for tuning in and listening to me, Gerald Cilenti takes over.
[02:12:55.481 --> 02:13:00.965]  Well, thank you, thank you, thank you for having me host the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars.
[02:13:01.045 --> 02:13:01.946]  Great being here.
[02:13:02.787 --> 02:13:07.870]  And again, as Owen was just showing, how stupid the mainstream media is.
[02:13:08.351 --> 02:13:10.192]  What a bunch of little low-lives.
[02:13:10.972 --> 02:13:12.994]  Boys and girls gotta be even here.
[02:13:14.145 --> 02:13:15.146]  One after another.
[02:13:15.166 --> 02:13:21.250]  And as Owen pointed out, there'll be no regret for their stupidity and ignorance in what they said.
[02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:23.792]  It doesn't matter to them at all.
[02:13:24.653 --> 02:13:27.495]  They just put out the propaganda and the people buy it.
[02:13:28.176 --> 02:13:31.098]  Like, you know, them Russians, they hacked into the DNC.
[02:13:31.198 --> 02:13:36.402]  No, that's why Hillary Clinton lost the election in 2016 against Trump.
[02:13:37.022 --> 02:13:39.104]  Wasn't because she's such a low life person.
[02:13:39.608 --> 02:13:41.469]  And had such a high negative rating.
[02:13:41.509 --> 02:13:42.949]  No, that had nothing to do with it.
[02:13:43.390 --> 02:13:44.330]  It was the Russians.
[02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:51.793]  Well, we can't give you any proof, but that's our assumption, our belief, our you-know-what that counts for nothing in a court of law.
[02:13:52.894 --> 02:14:04.099]  So, it's very, very important that you do all you can to keep the truth alive, support InfoWars, and of course, our magazine, The Trends Journal, the only magazine like it in the world.
[02:14:04.559 --> 02:14:06.740]  Tells you what's going on, what it means, and what's next.
[02:14:08.182 --> 02:14:10.003]  And that's not what you're getting anywhere else.
[02:14:10.603 --> 02:14:16.385]  And speaking about what's next, how about let's take a look at Goodbye Rosie, Queen of Coronavirus.
[02:14:17.045 --> 02:14:21.466]  I mean, to us, as we're looking at this, here's the big story.
[02:14:23.047 --> 02:14:36.251]  The big story is how the Chinese government could take almost total control of a country of 1.4 billion people, lock them down, watch them,
[02:14:36.994 --> 02:14:39.755]  Tell them what to do, how to do it, where to do it, and when to do it.
[02:14:41.236 --> 02:14:42.877]  That, to us, is the big story.
[02:14:43.757 --> 02:14:53.542]  And you're going to see this being replayed in country after country as economies decline more and militarism heats up even more.
[02:14:54.803 --> 02:14:57.824]  So the rulers are in control.
[02:14:59.045 --> 02:15:01.846]  And you're seeing it right in front of your eyes like you can't believe it.
[02:15:02.622 --> 02:15:05.744]  And how they're keeping people, you know, they caught the coronavirus.
[02:15:05.824 --> 02:15:07.425]  Okay, so you got a virus, you got sick.
[02:15:07.905 --> 02:15:09.166]  Doesn't mean you're gonna die.
[02:15:10.227 --> 02:15:13.149]  Under 2,000 people have died so far.
[02:15:13.569 --> 02:15:20.354]  2,000 people in a population, global population of 7.7 billion people.
[02:15:21.034 --> 02:15:21.895]  Adds up to nothing.
[02:15:23.576 --> 02:15:25.157]  So that's the way we're looking at this.
[02:15:26.578 --> 02:15:31.581]  Our experts do not believe that the coronavirus is a pandemic.
[02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:35.391]  And we don't see it becoming an epidemic.
[02:15:36.431 --> 02:15:38.392]  Although they're selling it as one.
[02:15:38.812 --> 02:15:40.653]  And that's what the mainstream media does.
[02:15:41.413 --> 02:15:46.755]  Just as Owen showed you all those clips about how they were selling this guy Avenatti.
[02:15:48.716 --> 02:15:51.477]  And maybe they spelled his name wrong at the end.
[02:15:51.497 --> 02:15:53.358]  Maybe it should have been Avenazzi, you know?
[02:15:54.038 --> 02:15:54.338]  Yeah.
[02:15:55.498 --> 02:15:57.259]  Another low-life piece of garbage.
[02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:02.281]  Oh, according to, anyway, the court ruling that found him guilty.
[02:16:03.137 --> 02:16:04.257]  So that's not my words.
[02:16:05.098 --> 02:16:08.819]  That's from the prosecutors who prosecuted.
[02:16:10.359 --> 02:16:12.240]  But that's what the media is dumbed down to.
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:18.142]  So going back to how they're selling the coronavirus, they get people tuned in.
[02:16:18.222 --> 02:16:19.282]  People are freaking out.
[02:16:21.803 --> 02:16:25.064]  And that's what they want to do, just like when there's a hurricane coming.
[02:16:25.805 --> 02:16:32.807]  You see all these little prostitutes dressed up with their raincoats on and the wind blowing and the water splashing
[02:16:33.413 --> 02:16:39.338]  Over the boardwalk, onto the streets, and the leaves blowing, and the trees bending.
[02:16:41.079 --> 02:16:44.042]  How they keep that going for day after day after day after day.
[02:16:45.103 --> 02:16:47.445]  Plus they're doing the same thing with the coronavirus.
[02:16:48.886 --> 02:16:51.708]  What effect will the coronavirus have on the global economy?
[02:16:52.969 --> 02:17:02.397]  According to some of the estimates out there, whether they're from the Goldman Sachs gang, or other investor groups,
[02:17:04.258 --> 02:17:05.659]  You're looking at banksters.
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:12.945]  You're looking at, at worst, a 0.1 decline.
[02:17:14.526 --> 02:17:18.029]  It's going to hurt the Chinese economy, and it already is.
[02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:19.771]  They're in problems.
[02:17:20.491 --> 02:17:24.755]  But you go back and look what happened already in this past weekend.
[02:17:26.876 --> 02:17:33.842]  The numbers coming out of Europe on economic growth in the last quarter
[02:17:34.875 --> 02:17:38.678]  Before this happened at the end of last year, before the coronavirus.
[02:17:39.839 --> 02:17:42.521]  They're facing almost recessionary times.
[02:17:43.621 --> 02:17:47.504]  You look at the data that just came out from Japan last night.
[02:17:49.606 --> 02:17:50.346]  The Decembers.
[02:17:52.528 --> 02:17:52.888]  Data.
[02:17:54.729 --> 02:17:55.130]  Terrible.
[02:17:56.130 --> 02:17:58.872]  You're looking at worst years in a long time, decades.
[02:18:00.534 --> 02:18:02.175]  This is before the coronavirus.
[02:18:03.353 --> 02:18:05.274]  There's a global slowdown going on.
[02:18:06.794 --> 02:18:12.776]  And as I forecast, you're going to see gold prices hit $2,000 an ounce.
[02:18:14.477 --> 02:18:16.137]  You're going to see the markets crash.
[02:18:17.578 --> 02:18:20.139]  And the world is going to enter into the greatest depression.
[02:18:21.099 --> 02:18:21.359]  When?
[02:18:22.499 --> 02:18:23.660]  Minus a wild card.
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:28.101]  The coronavirus is the kind of wild card that you can't see coming.
[02:18:28.802 --> 02:18:29.702]  And there's going to be others.
[02:18:31.322 --> 02:18:32.963]  The greatest depression is going to hit
[02:18:34.875 --> 02:18:44.843]  By this time, in 2021, there's no holding it back.
[02:18:46.344 --> 02:18:51.349]  All this cheap money they're dumping into the system, as I call it, is nothing more than monetary methadone.
[02:18:53.671 --> 02:19:00.937]  Into the repo markets overnight, some $7 trillion since September 17th have been pumped in.
[02:19:02.037 --> 02:19:03.839]  You're seeing what's now going on in China.
[02:19:05.708 --> 02:19:07.508]  You're pumping more dough into the system.
[02:19:08.388 --> 02:19:13.209]  Trying to boost up your economy that's slowing down.
[02:19:14.069 --> 02:19:14.830]  Very important.
[02:19:14.890 --> 02:19:16.030]  I mentioned gold prices.
[02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:19.070]  $1,580 an ounce as we're speaking.
[02:19:20.751 --> 02:19:22.911]  That's despite the dollar getting strong.
[02:19:25.151 --> 02:19:28.612]  The stronger the dollar gets, the lower gold prices go.
[02:19:29.372 --> 02:19:32.333]  Because you got to pay for gold in dollars.
[02:19:33.613 --> 02:19:34.593]  Goes back to China.
[02:19:35.319 --> 02:19:38.221]  Does China want to devalue its currency, the yuan?
[02:19:38.701 --> 02:19:38.941]  No.
[02:19:40.222 --> 02:19:41.362]  Are they going to have to?
[02:19:41.743 --> 02:19:42.043]  Yes.
[02:19:42.843 --> 02:19:44.884]  Because they're going to be pumping more cheap money in.
[02:19:45.725 --> 02:19:53.169]  The more cheap money that goes in, the lower the interest rates go, the lower the value of their currency.
[02:19:54.390 --> 02:19:59.632]  You're going to start hearing the BS that they're doing it purposely, so that they can export more product.
[02:20:00.273 --> 02:20:04.015]  Now, they're the largest importer of oil in the world.
[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:09.521]  Their GDP is even more consumer-based than ours.
[02:20:11.822 --> 02:20:15.243]  We have two-thirds, a little over two-thirds, they have over 70%.
[02:20:15.984 --> 02:20:17.304]  They import a lot of product.
[02:20:19.085 --> 02:20:24.847]  As the value of their currency goes down, they import less product because they can't afford it.
[02:20:25.447 --> 02:20:26.827]  They have stagflation.
[02:20:27.928 --> 02:20:31.809]  That means economies flat, inflation's going up.
[02:20:32.483 --> 02:20:38.246]  When inflation's going up, you don't want to lower interest rates, because it's going to make a bad situation worse.
[02:20:39.486 --> 02:20:41.207]  And that's what China's in right now.
[02:20:42.048 --> 02:20:43.849]  A very bad situation.
[02:20:45.149 --> 02:20:47.310]  Will it have an effect on the global economy?
[02:20:48.871 --> 02:20:50.772]  Yes, to some extent.
[02:20:51.532 --> 02:20:55.874]  It'll have a greater effect on the Chinese economy, to a much greater extent.
[02:20:57.315 --> 02:20:58.396]  If $40 trillion in debt
[02:21:01.288 --> 02:21:03.189]  The debt-to-GDP ratio is over 300.
[02:21:03.269 --> 02:21:05.531]  The good one's around 70-80.
[02:21:07.653 --> 02:21:12.576]  And now they gotta pump more cheap dough to keep the game afloat.
[02:21:14.738 --> 02:21:15.719]  It's not gonna happen.
[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:19.702]  We're gonna see a lot of riots, disturbances.
[02:21:20.542 --> 02:21:24.245]  And let's not forget, there's still Hong Kong going on.
[02:21:25.766 --> 02:21:27.848]  That's been out of the news of the coronavirus.
[02:21:29.309 --> 02:21:30.670]  So China's in a tough place.
[02:21:32.193 --> 02:21:33.214]  How bad will it be?
[02:21:33.294 --> 02:21:34.214]  How low will it go?
[02:21:35.735 --> 02:21:36.235]  Pretty low.
[02:21:39.737 --> 02:21:41.578]  So, what do you do to protect it?
[02:21:42.298 --> 02:21:49.302]  Well, first what you do is you consider securing your future.
[02:21:51.103 --> 02:21:52.384]  How do you secure your future?
[02:21:54.085 --> 02:22:00.008]  One of them, we're going to get back, we're going to tell you what to do and how to do it.
[02:22:00.652 --> 02:22:05.274]  And you could do it on Infowars, because they have some of the answers that you need.
[02:22:06.734 --> 02:22:10.696]  So, the future's coming.
[02:22:11.576 --> 02:22:12.236]  We see it.
[02:22:13.537 --> 02:22:14.317]  Be prepared.
[02:22:15.197 --> 02:22:16.618]  Prevail and prosper.
[02:22:17.318 --> 02:22:18.898]  Because this thing is going to get ugly.
[02:22:19.819 --> 02:22:21.900]  Real quick and real soon.
[02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:24.380]  How soon?
[02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:28.622]  The decline's underway in a country near you.
[02:22:29.736 --> 02:22:31.337]  More riots, more protests.
[02:22:32.839 --> 02:22:34.420]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:38.003]  Love being on the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars, all they do.
[02:22:38.444 --> 02:22:42.567]  And as I was saying before we went to the break, you better prepare for the worst.
[02:22:43.588 --> 02:22:49.613]  You know, the coronavirus, you know, we believe it's going to go away, but look how many other ways that they're going to, they're killing us.
[02:22:50.774 --> 02:22:55.198]  All the poisons that they're putting in our food and our water and the air.
[02:22:56.365 --> 02:23:03.992]  So what you need when the worst happens is to make sure that you have InfoWars Life Select storable food.
[02:23:04.813 --> 02:23:11.219]  Because when things go down and people are out of their minds, you need, you know, you've got to be prepared for the worst.
[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:17.545]  And with the rise of coronavirus, trouble brewing constantly overseas and more danger.
[02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:20.691]  Is constantly growing overseas.
[02:23:20.751 --> 02:23:27.735]  That's why it's so important to make sure that you have the storable food that you need to prepare today.
[02:23:28.696 --> 02:23:31.538]  With amounts ranging from three days to a whole year.
[02:23:31.558 --> 02:23:43.205]  Their storable food selection to make sure you're not a victim of circumstances and the manufacturers having difficulty keeping up with the current spike.
[02:23:43.765 --> 02:23:46.947]  As soon as it comes off the line, it's being shipped out.
[02:23:47.375 --> 02:23:49.476]  So secure your orders today.
[02:23:50.197 --> 02:23:54.339]  Right now, you should get your order in seven to ten days.
[02:23:54.419 --> 02:23:58.201]  However, this is getting delayed with each passing minute.
[02:23:58.321 --> 02:24:00.342]  So secure your spot now.
[02:24:01.083 --> 02:24:06.486]  Other suppliers aren't able to ship at all due to the huge demand.
[02:24:07.226 --> 02:24:13.589]  And it's also important to secure a clean, filtered water supply as debris and dust settle in.
[02:24:14.090 --> 02:24:14.550]  Having the
[02:24:15.106 --> 02:24:22.332]  Alexa Pure Water Filtration System can be one of the key parts of a proper survival plan.
[02:24:22.992 --> 02:24:27.416]  Those that know what's coming are using today to prepare.
[02:24:27.436 --> 02:24:32.700]  So don't be forced to rely and wait for others for your survival.
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:43.589]  Get one of InfoWars Emergency Storable Food Options or Water and Air Filtration Systems at massive discounts.
[02:24:44.330 --> 02:24:44.630]  Again,
[02:24:45.643 --> 02:24:49.604]  You can see where the future is heading, and it's not very pretty.
[02:24:50.645 --> 02:24:56.667]  So, you know, think for yourself is the motto of our magazine, The Trends Journal.
[02:24:57.187 --> 02:25:00.128]  And again, beyond the coronavirus, you can't drink the water.
[02:25:00.148 --> 02:25:01.548]  It's poisoned everywhere.
[02:25:02.409 --> 02:25:02.829]  Everywhere.
[02:25:02.869 --> 02:25:04.389]  Not everywhere, Mr. Sollenti.
[02:25:04.409 --> 02:25:06.370]  There's a couple of places where it's still safe.
[02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.370]  Yeah.
[02:25:07.851 --> 02:25:09.511]  You want some of that plastic in you?
[02:25:11.312 --> 02:25:11.472]  So,
[02:25:12.481 --> 02:25:14.182]  Very important to prepare for the future.
[02:25:14.202 --> 02:25:16.182]  And again, I don't give financial advice.
[02:25:17.063 --> 02:25:17.663]  I believe it.
[02:25:18.123 --> 02:25:21.004]  And again, I do not give financial advice.
[02:25:21.684 --> 02:25:25.426]  For me, gold is the best of the safe haven assets.
[02:25:26.146 --> 02:25:28.887]  And with prices still strong, is the dollar strong?
[02:25:29.367 --> 02:25:32.989]  It's telling you a story of where the future is heading.
[02:25:33.449 --> 02:25:34.789]  And the future is dark.
[02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:39.011]  On the economic front, it's only being artificially propped up.
[02:25:40.891 --> 02:25:42.132]  Part of my work every day,
[02:25:42.875 --> 02:25:52.858]  As I go through the news, get these papers delivered, the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, the Toilet Paper Record, the New York Times, just to see what's going on.
[02:25:53.598 --> 02:25:58.000]  And then I decide, from what I'm reading, what sounds real, what doesn't.
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:25:59.500]  Then I go to other countries.
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:01.821]  Iranian conflict's going on.
[02:26:01.941 --> 02:26:02.201]  Poof!
[02:26:02.521 --> 02:26:03.642]  I'm at Fars News Agency.
[02:26:03.722 --> 02:26:05.202]  I want to hear what the Iranians are saying.
[02:26:05.222 --> 02:26:07.503]  I want to hear what the Arabs are saying.
[02:26:07.563 --> 02:26:08.683]  I go to Al Jazeera.
[02:26:09.063 --> 02:26:11.464]  I only want to hear what the American prostitutes are saying.
[02:26:12.308 --> 02:26:15.889]  Well, Washington's saying, because I have trouble believing any of them.
[02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:19.591]  So, just to start off to show you where the economy's going.
[02:26:20.791 --> 02:26:30.774]  Hopes for Eurozone rebound dashed as growth slows to lowest rate in seven years.
[02:26:34.156 --> 02:26:39.017]  The single currency zone grew at a quarterly rate of 0.1%
[02:26:41.690 --> 02:26:58.077]  In the fourth quarter, its slowest rate of expansion since early 2013, Germany flatlined in the fourth quarter, producing zero growth.
[02:26:58.657 --> 02:27:00.758]  Has nothing to do with Corona.
[02:27:01.498 --> 02:27:03.519]  Has nothing to do with the virus.
[02:27:03.919 --> 02:27:05.900]  Has nothing to do with the trade war.
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:08.461]  We're talking about Germany.
[02:27:08.961 --> 02:27:10.982]  We're not talking about Zimbabwe.
[02:27:12.003 --> 02:27:18.326]  We're talking about the strongest country in the Eurozone in Europe, Germany, flat.
[02:27:20.047 --> 02:27:20.507]  All right?
[02:27:22.568 --> 02:27:23.929]  You keep going through the numbers.
[02:27:24.949 --> 02:27:27.591]  Manufacturing slips in the United States.
[02:27:29.852 --> 02:27:34.034]  Business investment declined in three out of four quarters in 2019.
[02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:43.503]  Remained constrained by weak global growth.
[02:27:44.244 --> 02:27:46.566]  Nothing to do with coronavirus.
[02:27:47.447 --> 02:27:49.328]  It's a global slowdown.
[02:27:49.428 --> 02:27:51.991]  You better prepare for the worst.
[02:27:52.551 --> 02:27:53.712]  It's coming.
[02:27:54.493 --> 02:27:55.834]  What else do we have over here?
[02:27:57.495 --> 02:28:04.041]  Industrial production, the measure of factory mining and utility output, decreased to seasonally adjusted 0.3%.
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:10.961]  Utilities production dropped 4% last month.
[02:28:14.623 --> 02:28:15.763]  Retail sales are up.
[02:28:15.864 --> 02:28:17.784]  The grand total is 0.2%.
[02:28:18.545 --> 02:28:19.865]  Hardly anything.
[02:28:24.127 --> 02:28:25.187]  Ain't a lot of growth.
[02:28:25.548 --> 02:28:25.888]  U.S.
[02:28:25.988 --> 02:28:32.370]  bulls shrug off outbreak worries as profit growth hopes fuel surge in stocks.
[02:28:33.811 --> 02:28:35.872]  Stock market's going to remain strong.
[02:28:36.658 --> 02:28:38.879]  As long as more cheap money could go in there.
[02:28:39.619 --> 02:28:41.179]  But there's something to watch out for.
[02:28:41.199 --> 02:28:44.700]  A warning sign just came out from the White House.
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:52.442]  They want to pass tax breaks so the average Jane and Joe could get involved in the equity markets.
[02:28:53.242 --> 02:28:54.122]  You know what that means?
[02:28:55.162 --> 02:28:59.623]  When they bring in the little people, it goes down.
[02:29:00.243 --> 02:29:02.764]  They get their last bucks and where they could get them from.
[02:29:03.663 --> 02:29:06.264]  Just like they did during that subprime mortgage time.
[02:29:06.304 --> 02:29:07.305]  You remember that one.
[02:29:07.885 --> 02:29:08.966]  You don't have a job.
[02:29:09.746 --> 02:29:10.747]  Don't have any credit.
[02:29:11.467 --> 02:29:12.608]  Got no money in the bank.
[02:29:13.468 --> 02:29:14.809]  I think you should buy a home.
[02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:19.391]  Just sign over here and you got yours.
[02:29:20.672 --> 02:29:30.016]  You're going to do the same thing with this subprime mortgage thing by getting people into the equity markets. 10%
[02:29:33.444 --> 02:29:38.946]  of the population own over 90% of the equity markets.
[02:29:39.667 --> 02:29:45.889]  It's only enriching the rich, which brings us to a very important point.
[02:29:47.490 --> 02:29:49.751]  Yep, people can't afford to buy houses.
[02:29:50.511 --> 02:29:52.932]  They got $14 trillion in debt.
[02:29:54.613 --> 02:29:59.935]  And they're living in cars because you could drive a car, but you can't.
[02:29:59.955 --> 02:30:02.476]  You can live in a car and drive it, but you can't drive a house.
[02:30:03.066 --> 02:30:04.227]  That's how bad things are.
[02:30:05.128 --> 02:30:07.590]  We're getting a third of the people living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:30:08.951 --> 02:30:10.172]  So things are going down.
[02:30:11.433 --> 02:30:12.634]  And you have to prepare.
[02:30:13.955 --> 02:30:17.958]  InfoWars helps you prepare with a lot of the products that they sell.
[02:30:19.900 --> 02:30:22.342]  And we help you prepare to see what's happening next.
[02:30:23.362 --> 02:30:25.304]  So that you can see the future.
[02:30:26.705 --> 02:30:29.948]  You get it in the Trends Journal and you read history before it happens.
[02:30:30.868 --> 02:30:32.690]  Prepare, prevail and prosper.
[02:30:33.422 --> 02:30:34.702]  This thing's going down.
[02:30:35.222 --> 02:30:36.203]  And who's it going to help?
[02:30:37.123 --> 02:30:39.763]  Ah, you'll see very soon who it's going to help.
[02:30:40.664 --> 02:30:41.964]  So we're going to be back in a few.
[02:30:42.044 --> 02:30:46.265]  And don't forget, do everything you can to keep the truth alive.
[02:30:46.945 --> 02:30:48.005]  Support InfoWars.
[02:30:48.326 --> 02:30:49.986]  We'll be back in just a few.
[02:30:51.646 --> 02:30:52.547]  Hello, hello.
[02:30:52.667 --> 02:30:54.787]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:55.747 --> 02:31:02.829]  And here we are in Kingston, New York, the first capital of New York State, where the seeds of democracy were sown, right here on the Four Corners.
[02:31:03.677 --> 02:31:06.840]  The only place with pre-Revolutionary War stone buildings on each corner.
[02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:14.185]  And most of America's Constitution came to the one that was written right over here, when John Jay, the Supreme Court judge, right?
[02:31:14.225 --> 02:31:14.946]  The first cat.
[02:31:15.687 --> 02:31:18.989]  He was a judge over here, and this was the first capital of New York State.
[02:31:19.690 --> 02:31:22.392]  The Constitution is written for New York State right over here.
[02:31:24.774 --> 02:31:28.277]  Most, over 70% of America's Constitution comes from it.
[02:31:28.617 --> 02:31:29.258]  That's a fact.
[02:31:29.438 --> 02:31:33.441]  So as we're talking about Constitution and facts, and where we're going,
[02:31:34.138 --> 02:31:35.838]  I was talking before about the economy.
[02:31:36.538 --> 02:31:42.800]  You know, my forecast 2020 top trends is that Trump by default in 2020.
[02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:46.300]  You know, I may change that forecast.
[02:31:47.201 --> 02:31:59.103]  And as you all know, from following me on InfoWars over the years and Trends Journal subscribers, in May of 2016, I called Trump the winner.
[02:31:59.983 --> 02:32:00.683]  It's a fact.
[02:32:02.504 --> 02:32:02.764]  He is
[02:32:04.175 --> 02:32:12.220]  The winner of 2016 and for our top trends of this year, we had him as the winner of the 2020 election.
[02:32:13.721 --> 02:32:15.602]  However, that might change.
[02:32:17.584 --> 02:32:20.526]  What we do is we look at global trends shaping the future.
[02:32:20.546 --> 02:32:27.590]  And there's a big movement going on because one of our other trends is called the New World Disorder.
[02:32:29.091 --> 02:32:33.094]  And how from Lebanon to France, from Algeria,
[02:32:33.848 --> 02:32:42.752]  To Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, all around the globe, Hong Kong.
[02:32:44.493 --> 02:32:50.416]  People are protesting against the entrenched interest, the corruption.
[02:32:52.457 --> 02:32:53.097]  And guess what?
[02:32:54.337 --> 02:32:58.019]  That's why Trump won in 2016.
[02:32:59.540 --> 02:33:02.201]  He was the new voice from the outside, the political party.
[02:33:03.700 --> 02:33:05.821]  So they just had an election over there in Ireland.
[02:33:06.862 --> 02:33:07.563]  Sinn Féin.
[02:33:09.104 --> 02:33:10.084]  Him out of nowhere.
[02:33:11.205 --> 02:33:12.246]  And one big.
[02:33:13.326 --> 02:33:14.487]  And you know what the issues are?
[02:33:16.429 --> 02:33:16.989]  Healthcare.
[02:33:18.810 --> 02:33:19.751]  Can't afford rent.
[02:33:20.691 --> 02:33:21.732]  Can't buy a house.
[02:33:22.853 --> 02:33:23.914]  Lousy jobs.
[02:33:24.814 --> 02:33:26.675]  All the money going to the 1%.
[02:33:27.936 --> 02:33:29.497]  And another big one.
[02:33:30.738 --> 02:33:32.019]  Homeless populations.
[02:33:33.951 --> 02:33:36.592]  It's not like the people want to live on a street in a tent, you know?
[02:33:39.514 --> 02:33:41.175]  The party there won.
[02:33:43.276 --> 02:33:46.598]  And that's what all these protests around the world are about.
[02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:55.323]  It's the 1% getting everything, the violence, the corruption of the established parties.
[02:33:57.184 --> 02:34:00.426]  Bernie Sanders has a shot.
[02:34:03.234 --> 02:34:05.296]  And this is the first time I'm saying this.
[02:34:07.357 --> 02:34:08.238]  Is he a phony?
[02:34:08.898 --> 02:34:11.320]  Phony of the first degree.
[02:34:13.001 --> 02:34:18.606]  Another boy that's never worked a day in his life sucking off the public you-know-what.
[02:34:22.569 --> 02:34:24.270]  This is the guy, by the way.
[02:34:24.990 --> 02:34:25.631]  He loved that.
[02:34:25.791 --> 02:34:27.012]  He's the peace candidate.
[02:34:27.052 --> 02:34:28.953]  Yeah, piece-of-crap candidate.
[02:34:29.754 --> 02:34:31.035]  This is the guy that supported
[02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:34.190]  The Bosnian War.
[02:34:34.590 --> 02:34:35.791]  The Yugoslav War.
[02:34:35.811 --> 02:34:40.452]  This is a guy that supported the Afghan War.
[02:34:42.212 --> 02:34:48.394]  Not only that, he voted against a resolution that would have forced Congress to vote to go to war.
[02:34:48.854 --> 02:34:51.615]  Rather, he gave it to the El Presidente.
[02:34:52.875 --> 02:34:59.897]  This is the clown boy that's bringing F-35 jets up into Burlington Air Force Base.
[02:35:03.271 --> 02:35:11.619]  He appeals to the millennials that are still living with mommy and daddy because they can't find a job.
[02:35:12.740 --> 02:35:17.425]  Generation Z, the ones younger, or Generation Zero.
[02:35:19.987 --> 02:35:23.611]  The whole country's been taken over by the monopolies.
[02:35:24.371 --> 02:35:26.934]  Mom and pops out, forget about it.
[02:35:27.785 --> 02:35:29.026]  All those stores are gone.
[02:35:29.066 --> 02:35:30.327]  The hardware stores?
[02:35:30.427 --> 02:35:32.389]  No, now we got Lowe's and Home Depot.
[02:35:32.409 --> 02:35:35.271]  We'll do away with the Lowe's so the bigs can own everything.
[02:35:36.072 --> 02:35:39.135]  Macy's, Target, Kohl's, put everybody else out of business.
[02:35:40.636 --> 02:35:41.216]  Staples?
[02:35:41.256 --> 02:35:42.718]  Who needs a stationary store?
[02:35:42.738 --> 02:35:43.418]  You got them.
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:47.542]  So the young people have no future.
[02:35:49.163 --> 02:35:52.126]  Same thing that's going on around the world.
[02:35:52.566 --> 02:35:55.949]  They're going into these anti-establishment parties.
[02:35:56.795 --> 02:36:04.318]  And Phony Sanders is painting himself as the outsider in the inside group.
[02:36:05.839 --> 02:36:11.001]  Here are some of his quotes from the toilet paper a record.
[02:36:14.002 --> 02:36:24.427]  Would you consider military force to preempt, to preempt an Iranian or North Korean
[02:36:26.363 --> 02:36:30.024]  Nuclear or missile test?
[02:36:30.184 --> 02:36:30.704]  A test.
[02:36:31.925 --> 02:36:38.286]  Would you strike Iran or North Korea because they want to test the nuclear missile?
[02:36:39.027 --> 02:36:40.287]  Only we're allowed to test them.
[02:36:41.047 --> 02:36:42.268]  So you know what he said he would do?
[02:36:44.988 --> 02:36:46.609]  Yep, he would strike.
[02:36:47.369 --> 02:36:50.230]  Yeah, Bernie the peace candidate.
[02:36:50.690 --> 02:36:54.451]  Piece of crap when you look at his track record.
[02:36:55.518 --> 02:37:11.807]  Again, as I've mentioned, this is the boy who supported Bill Clinton's sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s that killed over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five.
[02:37:11.827 --> 02:37:23.693]  And as they've shown you before on InfoWars, there's the UN ambassador at the time, Madeleine, not all that bright, telling Leslie Stahl on 60 Minutes,
[02:37:24.602 --> 02:37:28.865]  That the price of 500,000 dead Iraqi children was worth the price of sanctions.
[02:37:29.245 --> 02:37:31.006]  Yeah, it really worked great, didn't it, huh?
[02:37:31.826 --> 02:37:32.127]  Yeah.
[02:37:32.907 --> 02:37:34.268]  That's Bernie Sanders.
[02:37:35.289 --> 02:37:39.551]  Yeah, matter of fact, those sanctions worked so great, let's invade the place in 2003.
[02:37:40.012 --> 02:37:47.356]  On lies, that's Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda.
[02:37:47.636 --> 02:37:49.557]  And Bernie says, I voted against that?
[02:37:50.758 --> 02:37:52.619]  Yeah, but you voted against all the other things.
[02:37:55.336 --> 02:37:56.557]  He has a shot at winning.
[02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:01.140]  What else do we have here?
[02:38:02.602 --> 02:38:07.325]  Would you consider military force for humanitarian intervention?
[02:38:07.786 --> 02:38:10.167]  You know that humanitarian intervention BS.
[02:38:11.028 --> 02:38:14.371]  I don't like the way he's treating his people over there, that Qaddafi.
[02:38:14.991 --> 02:38:18.033]  Said the Nobel piece of crap prize winner Barack Obama.
[02:38:18.914 --> 02:38:21.676]  Along with Hitler, E. Clinton, Samantha Power, and Susan Rice.
[02:38:22.637 --> 02:38:23.958]  If only women were in charge.
[02:38:25.233 --> 02:38:26.053]  And people of color.
[02:38:26.754 --> 02:38:27.174]  Yeah.
[02:38:28.835 --> 02:38:29.776]  Makes no difference.
[02:38:30.276 --> 02:38:31.557]  Good and bad comes in all of them.
[02:38:32.137 --> 02:38:33.078]  So we'll save that.
[02:38:34.058 --> 02:38:35.699]  So Bernie would do the same thing.
[02:38:35.719 --> 02:38:39.461]  I want that guy who's sought out and I don't like the way he's treating his people.
[02:38:41.202 --> 02:38:42.023]  He's a phony.
[02:38:43.183 --> 02:38:52.269]  But if he gets the young people that he's bringing in, here's the bottom line.
[02:38:53.890 --> 02:38:54.410]  The young
[02:38:56.539 --> 02:38:58.020]  Are more than the old.
[02:38:59.340 --> 02:39:01.141]  Trump's going to get the older demographic.
[02:39:03.502 --> 02:39:13.626]  But he could lose significantly and will lose significantly the millennial demographic if Bernie Sanders gets the nomination.
[02:39:14.947 --> 02:39:18.928]  And that may not be enough for him to lose the swing states, Trump.
[02:39:19.989 --> 02:39:21.149]  Trump could lose Michigan.
[02:39:21.850 --> 02:39:23.050]  He could lose Wisconsin.
[02:39:24.051 --> 02:39:25.051]  He could lose Ohio.
[02:39:27.549 --> 02:39:35.691]  If, if enough Millennials and Generation Z support Bernie.
[02:39:37.032 --> 02:39:38.352]  Because they buy the BS.
[02:39:38.792 --> 02:39:41.293]  And all it is, is the presidential reality show.
[02:39:42.253 --> 02:39:43.633]  And you know what politics is.
[02:39:44.854 --> 02:39:46.594]  It's show business for ugly people.
[02:39:47.234 --> 02:39:48.115]  That's all this is.
[02:39:48.195 --> 02:39:50.475]  It's show business like no business.
[02:39:51.476 --> 02:39:52.596]  And Bernie's there.
[02:39:54.306 --> 02:39:56.748]  Then there's this other guy we're going to talk about too.
[02:39:56.768 --> 02:40:00.970]  There's Buddha Gig, Buddha Gang, Butter Gig, Buddha whatever the gig is.
[02:40:01.911 --> 02:40:03.231]  But the gig's a phony one.
[02:40:03.251 --> 02:40:05.533]  They had a CIA boy.
[02:40:06.433 --> 02:40:07.074]  Could he win?
[02:40:08.234 --> 02:40:08.675]  He could.
[02:40:08.915 --> 02:40:10.056]  Nah, I don't think so.
[02:40:11.396 --> 02:40:12.137]  For other reasons.
[02:40:13.017 --> 02:40:17.160]  But Bernie, Sanders has a shot.
[02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:18.921]  When we come back,
[02:40:20.304 --> 02:40:25.246]  Goodbye Rosie, Queen of Coronavirus, see me and Julio down by the schoolyard.
[02:40:26.107 --> 02:40:26.387]  Yep.
[02:40:27.187 --> 02:40:34.510]  And again, to stay healthy, what you want is Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion combo, 50% off.
[02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:36.351]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 40% off.
[02:40:36.371 --> 02:40:37.972]  And Ultra 12, 40% off individually.
[02:40:45.342 --> 02:41:00.728]  So to boost your body and support your immune system against the coming illness season, they're bringing you Vitamin Mineral Fusion and Ultra 12 50% off when purchased.
[02:41:01.489 --> 02:41:13.733]  Experience the power of both highly concentrated B12 and a great tasting combination of all the vitamins and minerals your body needs to push through the day for less.
[02:41:14.274 --> 02:41:14.554]  Ultra 12
[02:41:15.606 --> 02:41:20.749]  Is there a vitamin B12 formula reimagined with a more powerful and concentrated source?
[02:41:21.370 --> 02:41:30.496]  So look, as things are getting bad and times are getting tough and you got to stay healthy, these are the products you need to get on top and to stay on top.
[02:41:31.236 --> 02:41:35.159]  One of my sayings is when things are going down, you got to double up.
[02:41:35.479 --> 02:41:40.242]  You got to double up on your health, double up on your fitness, get strong.
[02:41:40.362 --> 02:41:43.484]  And these products help you do that and stay in good shape.
[02:41:44.292 --> 02:41:53.579]  And for me, I like that super male vitality, keeps that boogie going, you know, and you got to boogie before the lights go out because tomorrow is iffy.
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:42:11.193]  And speaking about the lights going out and tomorrow is iffy, over the weekend, some 30 civilians were killed in Yemen by the murderous Saudi group that the United States and France and the UK are selling weapons to.
[02:42:11.513 --> 02:42:13.535]  It's the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth.
[02:42:14.568 --> 02:42:18.129]  Doesn't make the news at all.
[02:42:18.149 --> 02:42:19.810]  14 million people starving to death.
[02:42:21.690 --> 02:42:26.472]  So you know I launched Occupy Peace so I put my money where my heart is and my mind is.
[02:42:27.332 --> 02:42:29.333]  But this does not make the news at all.
[02:42:29.373 --> 02:42:30.293]  It's totally out.
[02:42:31.074 --> 02:42:32.934]  So going back to the election for a moment.
[02:42:34.155 --> 02:42:35.635]  Someone I really respect.
[02:42:35.715 --> 02:42:37.056]  I really like her writing.
[02:42:37.896 --> 02:42:39.537]  And her name is Caitlin Johnson.
[02:42:40.677 --> 02:42:41.477]  Or John Stone.
[02:42:43.860 --> 02:42:48.623]  She writes about Buttigieg and what's going on in Washington.
[02:42:50.624 --> 02:42:57.308]  She says, talking about the institutions that are already in power, the dumb-o-craps and the repulsive-kins, as I call them.
[02:43:01.350 --> 02:43:04.852]  She said, change is not going to come from these institutions.
[02:43:05.453 --> 02:43:13.017]  It's going to come from the people using the power of their numbers to force important changes that those institutions do not want to make.
[02:43:13.914 --> 02:43:22.136]  And Pete Buttigieg knows this, and so do the spooks and oligarchs who are backing him.
[02:43:23.896 --> 02:43:42.240]  It is very appropriate that a military intelligence officer with ties to the CIA, who is beloved by intelligence defense agency insiders, and who appears to have been groomed by national security mandarins from the very beginning of his career,
[02:43:43.567 --> 02:43:49.450]  Should be actively working to kill a revolutionary zeitgeist.
[02:43:50.470 --> 02:44:00.014]  After all, backing counter revolutionaries is a favorite CIA activity.
[02:44:01.195 --> 02:44:13.160]  She goes on to write, progressives already got sucked into forfeiting their revolutionary spirit in exchange for flowery prose and empty rhetoric.
[02:44:13.988 --> 02:44:17.030]  The last time they elected Pete Buttigieg for president.
[02:44:17.771 --> 02:44:23.175]  Back then, when Pete Buttigieg was named Barack Obama.
[02:44:23.976 --> 02:44:31.222]  It was literally the exact same script they're trying to recycle with Puppet Pete.
[02:44:32.423 --> 02:44:34.484]  She's really nailed this.
[02:44:35.545 --> 02:44:37.707]  This guy is the other Obama.
[02:44:39.958 --> 02:44:41.338]  All of his empty rhetoric.
[02:44:41.438 --> 02:44:43.739]  I ask young people, who do you like?
[02:44:43.779 --> 02:44:46.320]  Well, I like Bernie Sanders, but I don't think he could get elected.
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:48.200]  But I like Mayor Pete.
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:49.541]  They call him Mayor Pete.
[02:44:50.781 --> 02:44:51.401]  What do you like him?
[02:44:51.941 --> 02:44:54.102]  Well, you know, he's very elegant, eloquent.
[02:44:55.062 --> 02:44:58.803]  And, you know, I support the gay community.
[02:44:58.903 --> 02:44:59.223]  Great.
[02:45:00.224 --> 02:45:00.824]  He's eloquent.
[02:45:00.864 --> 02:45:01.964]  You support the gay community.
[02:45:02.624 --> 02:45:04.045]  What about his stance on anything?
[02:45:04.485 --> 02:45:08.006]  Well, you know, the way he expresses himself, you know, he's very intelligent.
[02:45:08.846 --> 02:45:09.106]  Yeah, but
[02:45:10.236 --> 02:45:11.797]  On what issues do you support him?
[02:45:12.817 --> 02:45:14.318]  They don't have a clue of any issue.
[02:45:16.138 --> 02:45:18.319]  This guy's just more of the same, but worse.
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:21.280]  He's another Obama.
[02:45:23.922 --> 02:45:26.282]  And if he's not here now, he'll be back again.
[02:45:27.963 --> 02:45:29.464]  And people buy the BS.
[02:45:30.344 --> 02:45:31.144]  People forget.
[02:45:31.164 --> 02:45:36.527]  I have the magazines, right after Obama got elected.
[02:45:37.707 --> 02:45:39.908]  Oh yeah, they had him as George Washington.
[02:45:40.834 --> 02:45:41.935]  Yeah, there's that Buddha gag.
[02:45:41.975 --> 02:45:46.258]  Look at him, all dressed up in his military outfit there, tough guy.
[02:45:46.838 --> 02:45:48.179]  Yeah, you ever saw Warfare?
[02:45:48.239 --> 02:45:48.540]  Nah.
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:50.941]  I think he used to drive the generals around.
[02:45:50.961 --> 02:45:52.863]  An insider.
[02:45:53.363 --> 02:45:58.427]  Oh, and then people say also, people that are anti-war, they say, oh, and he's a veteran.
[02:45:59.007 --> 02:46:00.529]  A veteran of the CIA.
[02:46:01.489 --> 02:46:04.471]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks.
[02:46:05.092 --> 02:46:06.353]  He's a Harvard boy!
[02:46:07.114 --> 02:46:08.894]  A Rhodes Scholar!
[02:46:09.155 --> 02:46:11.455]  Oh yeah, Rhodes, that guy.
[02:46:11.475 --> 02:46:15.416]  Yeah, that Rhodesia, that Rhodes.
[02:46:16.176 --> 02:46:17.917]  Yeah, wonderful, wonderful man.
[02:46:19.457 --> 02:46:21.418]  Like Apartheid, he was a champion.
[02:46:22.538 --> 02:46:23.518]  That's Buttigieg.
[02:46:24.959 --> 02:46:26.159]  He's right in there.
[02:46:27.179 --> 02:46:27.659]  One of them.
[02:46:27.679 --> 02:46:31.500]  A puppet.
[02:46:33.201 --> 02:46:34.181]  The next Obama.
[02:46:36.192 --> 02:46:38.053]  And boy, he's doing the sale.
[02:46:38.994 --> 02:46:45.957]  But as I said, just this weekend, I changed my forecast.
[02:46:46.938 --> 02:46:52.501]  I'm not, I still think Trump 2020, but Sanders has a shot.
[02:46:53.361 --> 02:46:53.601]  Yeah.
[02:46:54.562 --> 02:47:03.767]  And that Buddha gig, just a member of the Silicon Valley, gutless, spineless,
[02:47:06.087 --> 02:47:08.248]  Not an ounce of passion in their soul.
[02:47:11.049 --> 02:47:15.790]  Big time tech guys and girls that he's getting the support from.
[02:47:16.730 --> 02:47:20.872]  And a lot of big money behind him coming from the financial industry.
[02:47:22.032 --> 02:47:23.172]  He's just their puppet.
[02:47:24.213 --> 02:47:25.013]  Puppet Pete.
[02:47:26.853 --> 02:47:31.035]  As Caitlin Johnston accurately identified him.
[02:47:33.115 --> 02:47:35.176]  So as we're moving into this election cycle,
[02:47:36.175 --> 02:47:49.700]  Another thing that you know I had forecast on Alex Jones before, and it looks like it's coming to pass right now, is that I said before the election, there will be peace with Afghanistan.
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:51.461]  There'll be a peace treaty.
[02:47:53.041 --> 02:47:55.262]  And there'll be a peace treaty with North Korea.
[02:47:56.383 --> 02:47:57.883]  And that's going to help Trump too.
[02:47:59.024 --> 02:48:02.585]  And again, I don't like any of them.
[02:48:04.241 --> 02:48:11.486]  The only one I like at all is, and she's off the list now, is Tulsi Gabbard for her peace program.
[02:48:12.546 --> 02:48:14.468]  And she fought in the military.
[02:48:14.528 --> 02:48:15.928]  She was in Iraq in medical.
[02:48:16.769 --> 02:48:19.951]  She saw the suffering that our soldiers are going through.
[02:48:23.013 --> 02:48:24.734]  And that's why she wants to end the wars.
[02:48:26.755 --> 02:48:29.177]  And that's why Eisenhower hated war.
[02:48:30.390 --> 02:48:41.277]  Five-star General, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, two-term President, who also said anyone seeking the office is either an egomaniac or crazy.
[02:48:41.717 --> 02:48:41.997]  He wasn't.
[02:48:42.018 --> 02:48:43.098]  He didn't seek the office.
[02:48:43.158 --> 02:48:44.019]  The office sought him.
[02:48:45.099 --> 02:48:53.225]  And he gave his farewell address, warning that the military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists who are the labors of the future of the children.
[02:48:53.905 --> 02:48:54.726]  And that's what's happened.
[02:48:56.967 --> 02:48:59.809]  So, you got these guys over here,
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:07.325]  From Sanders, to Buttigieg, to the rest, it was okay with them.
[02:49:08.605 --> 02:49:08.906]  Yeah.
[02:49:10.567 --> 02:49:18.992]  Going back to the troops, we have over 20 a day committing suicide that have left the service.
[02:49:20.613 --> 02:49:27.238]  So I want to see a new GI Bill to take care of them.
[02:49:28.809 --> 02:49:31.210]  And one of the ways we could do that is with Occupy Peace.
[02:49:31.230 --> 02:49:37.553]  We close all the bases overseas and put the troops to work rebuilding our third world infrastructure.
[02:49:38.434 --> 02:49:39.434]  Give them skills.
[02:49:41.195 --> 02:49:42.455]  Hands-on knowledge.
[02:49:43.916 --> 02:49:45.277]  And the industry is looking for them.
[02:49:46.057 --> 02:49:47.218]  They're short of good workers.
[02:49:50.199 --> 02:49:51.520]  And that's what we need right now.
[02:49:52.620 --> 02:49:53.361]  Of good workers.
[02:49:55.161 --> 02:49:55.922]  And they could be it.
[02:49:56.322 --> 02:49:56.922]  Our troops.
[02:49:57.763 --> 02:49:58.563]  To have a future.
[02:49:59.522 --> 02:50:05.063]  Rather than wasting our money destroying other countries and getting people to hate us that want to retaliate.
[02:50:06.704 --> 02:50:17.227]  If I was in Iraqi and my country was invaded by a foreign force and want to kill every foreigner that came into my country of that country that occupied and destroyed my nation.
[02:50:18.147 --> 02:50:19.407]  So we need peace on earth.
[02:50:20.227 --> 02:50:21.568]  It's up to you to make it happen.
[02:50:22.468 --> 02:50:24.188]  It's up to you to keep the truth flowing.
[02:50:25.329 --> 02:50:26.629]  So again do you can to
[02:50:27.526 --> 02:50:29.929]  Support InfoWars, buy their great products.
[02:50:30.069 --> 02:50:31.530]  I do, I believe in a lot of them.
[02:50:32.872 --> 02:50:35.194]  And again, it's up to you to make the change.
[02:50:35.675 --> 02:50:44.665]  It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men and women.
[02:50:45.606 --> 02:50:47.628]  See you next week, and thanks a lot.
[02:50:59.008 --> 02:51:02.770]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:51:03.310 --> 02:51:06.532]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:51:06.792 --> 02:51:09.454]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:51:10.074 --> 02:51:12.936]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:51:13.616 --> 02:51:15.277]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:51:15.857 --> 02:51:17.318]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:51:17.939 --> 02:51:23.043]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:51:23.403 --> 02:51:31.350]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:51:31.890 --> 02:51:38.275]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:51:38.596 --> 02:51:41.418]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:51:51.021 --> 02:52:01.767]  I told you two weeks ago that almost all the other major food distributors were actually sold out of food and trying to now buy up more food.
[02:52:02.585 --> 02:52:12.771]  But then our big sponsor that we've had for over 10 years, MyPaperSupply, had plenty of food on hand, but they were honest that there was a 7 to 10 day wait because they had to package it running 24 hours a day.
[02:52:13.312 --> 02:52:16.554]  Three or four times the biggest volume of ordering that they've ever seen.
[02:52:17.114 --> 02:52:28.421]  With Homeland Security and with FEMA and with the Office of Personnel, all of them trying to call and buy up whatever food they had for their quarantine centers around the United States.
[02:52:28.581 --> 02:52:29.641]  Remember, that was two weeks ago.
[02:52:29.662 --> 02:52:34.003]  I told you they're setting up quarantine centers, and they want emergency backup food for folks inside quarantine centers.
[02:52:34.284 --> 02:52:34.824]  And the U.S.
[02:52:34.844 --> 02:52:38.445]  government already has huge stockpiles of storable food, so why would they be wanting even more?
[02:52:38.465 --> 02:52:44.608]  Because a lot of it's 20, 30 years old, and the government employees want good stuff, and they know MyPatriot's good, but they're buying up everything already.
[02:52:44.688 --> 02:52:47.149]  Now, a lot of these other companies, I don't have them as sponsors.
[02:52:47.229 --> 02:52:49.130]  I could have six, seven food sponsors right now.
[02:52:49.270 --> 02:52:55.093]  I don't, because I learned early on, if there's not a big rush, and there's nothing going on, they got the food, and, you know, it's okay.
[02:52:55.273 --> 02:52:55.714]  But when there's
[02:53:12.791 --> 02:53:15.792]  And you get it just as fast as anybody else that orders from them.
[02:53:16.052 --> 02:53:17.273]  And it supports the operation.
[02:53:17.513 --> 02:53:19.454]  And now it's 10 to 14 days.
[02:53:19.634 --> 02:53:21.094]  They're right at about 10 days right now.
[02:53:21.114 --> 02:53:24.275]  I just wanted to say 10 to 14 because the orders aren't going down.
[02:53:24.335 --> 02:53:27.617]  They're intensifying because folks know this is really serious now.
[02:53:27.657 --> 02:53:35.700]  But for 2020, for economic issues down the road, for inflation, for a possible depression, for any reason, this is insurance you can eat.
[02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:38.841]  This is stuff that you can save and know that you're always going to use.
[02:53:38.861 --> 02:53:41.742]  If you don't use your car insurance or your medical, well, it's money lost.
[02:53:41.802 --> 02:53:45.103]  But with this, it tastes as good as 10 years as it does today.
[02:53:45.243 --> 02:53:49.184]  And a lot of this food is indistinguishable from gourmet-type stuff you get at the store.
[02:53:49.264 --> 02:53:50.264]  Some of it tastes okay.
[02:53:50.324 --> 02:53:53.325]  But for the price, you're getting the best high-quality stuff there is out there.
[02:53:53.365 --> 02:53:54.345]  Nobody can come close.
[02:53:54.405 --> 02:53:56.046]  They're cheaper than all the major competitors.
[02:53:56.246 --> 02:53:59.267]  And they want to be so that you come back to them over and over again.
[02:53:59.287 --> 02:54:00.887]  They're now the biggest storable food company.
[02:54:01.007 --> 02:54:03.988]  In the United States, they have the great Alexa Pure filtration.
[02:54:04.108 --> 02:54:05.029]  You see it's top rated.
[02:54:05.069 --> 02:54:07.649]  Their air filter is top rated, but half the price of competitors.
[02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:09.210]  They have the same philosophy as I do.
[02:54:09.230 --> 02:54:16.953]  So I want to go out and get one sponsor, one supplier that's just good year after year, that you get a great response from, that I use, and that you get quality products from.
[02:54:17.073 --> 02:54:30.283]  And so, it's there, it's available right now, and I would advise everybody, if you've been on the fence about a four-week supply, about a three-month supply, about a six-month supply, about a year's supply, this is something that everybody that can should have.
[02:54:30.364 --> 02:54:33.946]  And it's in these great, high-quality plastic tote containers that are sealed.
[02:54:34.046 --> 02:54:37.990]  Then it's got sealed packaging inside of that that's absolutely filled to the brim.
[02:54:38.130 --> 02:54:39.871]  You're not paying for air here, folks.
[02:54:39.991 --> 02:54:41.893]  This is the best bang for your buck out there.
[02:54:41.913 --> 02:54:44.815]  That's why they are our supplier.
[02:54:44.975 --> 02:54:52.717]  So don't wait anymore, go to mforestore.com, get your order in today, and know that you will be at the front of the line to get it as quickly as possible.
[02:54:52.757 --> 02:54:59.859]  You get it in, it's guaranteed 10 to 14 days, they have the food, it's just that they've gotta package it, and it is crazy, the volume.
[02:54:59.999 --> 02:55:01.840]  It just does not exist out there.
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:07.642]  And I was there two weeks ago, and they were saying, should we spend everything we get coming in to order more food for other folks?
[02:55:07.662 --> 02:55:08.622]  Do you think this is how bad?
[02:55:08.682 --> 02:55:10.903]  I said, yeah, no, I think your gut level's right.
[02:55:10.943 --> 02:55:11.763]  I said, go all in.
[02:55:12.763 --> 02:55:17.706]  I think unfortunately, you know, in a month you'll be selling more food than you are now, because I think this is pretty serious.
[02:55:17.726 --> 02:55:19.107]  The response we're seeing is really serious.
[02:55:19.167 --> 02:55:20.648]  And regardless, 2020 is a crazy year.
[02:55:20.708 --> 02:55:21.729]  People need to be prepared.
[02:55:22.469 --> 02:55:25.951]  And so they've purchased a ton more food, and it's all coming in, all getting ready.
[02:55:25.991 --> 02:55:30.294]  But you order now, you're ordering food they have in stock that you will get.
[02:55:30.394 --> 02:55:31.915]  But I would not wait any more.
[02:55:31.975 --> 02:55:32.615]  What's going on?
[02:55:33.155 --> 02:55:35.697]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:35.737 --> 02:55:39.199]  They have a lot of specialty meals, you name it.
[02:55:39.719 --> 02:55:40.520]  Amazing food.
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:40.980]  Get it today.
[02:55:51.078 --> 02:56:01.569]  I almost feel opportunistic when I'm positioned with the very nano-silver that the Pentagon and Homeland Security has said has been proven to take out SARS.
[02:56:01.749 --> 02:56:02.290]  But you know what?
[02:56:02.410 --> 02:56:03.491]  I've been selling it for years.
[02:56:03.772 --> 02:56:05.213]  So, that's what this comes down to.
[02:56:05.373 --> 02:56:09.618]  I sold out of this yesterday, as I told you, but still kept it discounted, the 16-ounce bottles.
[02:56:09.718 --> 02:56:13.121]  We're selling out of the one ounce bottles very, very quickly as well.
[02:56:13.221 --> 02:56:13.901]  A little spray bottle.
[02:56:14.061 --> 02:56:16.083]  This will sell out within a week, the three ounce bottles.
[02:56:16.243 --> 02:56:17.344]  And it's just high quality.
[02:56:17.524 --> 02:56:18.545]  And is it a silver bullet?
[02:56:18.705 --> 02:56:25.330]  No, but they call it a silver bullet in lore because silver is just a metal based antibiotic type system.
[02:56:25.530 --> 02:56:26.851]  And again, it's not perfect.
[02:56:26.931 --> 02:56:27.912]  Consult your physician.
[02:56:28.072 --> 02:56:32.956]  It's something that I normally just gargle with a couple of times a week, but you can actually, this is approved to drink.
[02:56:32.976 --> 02:56:34.697]  That's why it's at 15 parts, but it's nano.
[02:56:34.797 --> 02:56:36.999]  Just remember any antibiotic, whether it's,
[02:56:37.359 --> 02:56:40.841]  Classic antibiotics or whether it's metals-based has its downside as well.
[02:56:42.262 --> 02:56:45.263]  My dad was basically on death's doorstep six years ago.
[02:56:45.764 --> 02:56:50.927]  My uncle, his uncle, and my cousin had all died, lived at the same ranch, from the same bad pneumonia.
[02:56:51.607 --> 02:56:53.148]  I came in when the doctors couldn't help my dad.
[02:56:53.168 --> 02:56:54.449]  He'd been on three different antibiotics.
[02:56:55.069 --> 02:56:59.611]  I could tell he was going the same way and I just basically assaulted him and poured three bottles of colloidal silver down him.
[02:57:00.052 --> 02:57:01.232]  Well, this was even better than that.
[02:57:01.272 --> 02:57:02.833]  By the way, my dad pissed green for a week.
[02:57:03.253 --> 02:57:05.795]  Sure wasn't good for his liver and kidneys, but he came back and lived, okay?
[02:57:06.235 --> 02:57:07.216]  I'm not saying that did that.
[02:57:07.696 --> 02:57:10.138]  I just didn't put it in God's hands.
[02:57:10.198 --> 02:57:12.359]  I took action because God helps those that help themselves.
[02:57:12.919 --> 02:57:16.181]  So what I'm getting at here is we're selling out of this silver.
[02:57:16.221 --> 02:57:17.362]  We're keeping it discounted.
[02:57:17.402 --> 02:57:18.743]  We're sold out of the colloidal silver.
[02:57:18.763 --> 02:57:19.924]  That hadn't come back in yet.
[02:57:20.884 --> 02:57:22.585]  It was already sold out before this crisis began.
[02:57:22.605 --> 02:57:24.887]  We have the great storable foods in case you've got a shelter in place.
[02:57:25.367 --> 02:57:28.070]  But I have that just because you should be self-sufficient and ready.
[02:57:28.410 --> 02:57:30.992]  All the other big suppliers we know of have already sold out.
[02:57:31.012 --> 02:57:32.273]  There's no taking your orders.
[02:57:32.734 --> 02:57:34.535]  Our supplier has the food.
[02:57:34.555 --> 02:57:35.496]  They've got to package it.
[02:57:35.656 --> 02:57:39.440]  And they called me two days ago and said, you've got to tell listeners it's now 10 to 14.
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:40.741]  I said, is it really 10 to 14?
[02:57:40.921 --> 02:57:41.822]  They said, yeah.
[02:57:42.282 --> 02:57:46.823]  In a few days, it'll certainly be in 10 days, and then we've got the food, but it's increasing.
[02:57:46.863 --> 02:57:49.604]  Institutional buyers are trying to buy it up, and that's what scares them.
[02:57:49.764 --> 02:57:56.965]  I had talks two weeks ago with the owner and the founder and the CEO and all that, and they're just like, do you think we should keep buying more food or should we just sell out?
[02:57:56.985 --> 02:57:57.725]  What do you think we should do?
[02:57:57.745 --> 02:57:59.546]  Because it's hard to buy food when it goes up in price.
[02:57:59.566 --> 02:58:02.326]  And I said, I believe you should put everything you have into buying more food.
[02:58:02.506 --> 02:58:03.827]  I believe this is probably real.
[02:58:03.907 --> 02:58:05.067]  I don't want to tell my audience that.
[02:58:05.247 --> 02:58:07.268]  Let's wait and see, but they'll have food they eat anyways.
[02:58:07.469 --> 02:58:10.251]  And sure enough, unfortunately, you see, this is a serious.
[02:58:10.291 --> 02:58:11.672]  So it's good to be prepared.
[02:58:11.872 --> 02:58:12.892]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:58:12.952 --> 02:58:15.034]  It funds our independent Maverick operation.
[02:58:15.374 --> 02:58:15.995]  It's horrible food.
[02:58:16.015 --> 02:58:16.675]  It's high quality.
[02:58:17.055 --> 02:58:19.817]  And we have the best nano silver you're going to find out there.
[02:58:19.837 --> 02:58:22.840]  I mean, the super silver wound gel is the same nano, but it's super strong.
[02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:23.820]  You can't ingest this.
[02:58:24.181 --> 02:58:25.722]  This is private labeled in stores.
[02:58:26.202 --> 02:58:27.223]  They have this in hospitals.
[02:58:27.543 --> 02:58:28.664]  These are great patriots.
[02:58:28.684 --> 02:58:29.704]  And here's the company right here.
[02:58:29.724 --> 02:58:30.905]  They want their name said.
[02:58:30.945 --> 02:58:31.366]  I've been with them.
[02:58:31.946 --> 02:58:36.388]  Six, seven years, but it's American Biotech Labs out of Colorado.
[02:58:36.488 --> 02:58:42.391]  Here's all the Pentagon documents, Department of the Army, Headquarters Army, Homeland Security, A&M, talking about how amazing it is.
[02:58:42.451 --> 02:58:43.251]  Is it a silver bullet?
[02:58:43.311 --> 02:58:45.873]  No, but it's just one more defense and it funds the M4.
