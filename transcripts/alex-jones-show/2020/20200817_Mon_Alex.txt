[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:20.315]  When the UN signs a treaty with almost every nation on earth in 1992 to by 2020 be in full swing for a post-industrial world that causes an 80% population collapse by 2050, if you look at the numbers and what that would do, it's road warrior, end of the world stuff.
[00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.232]  I mean, Revelation says the Antichrist kills, what is it, two-thirds of the Earth?
[00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:25.972]  I forget.
[00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.253]  You know, die during all this?
[00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:29.034]  Well, the UN says 80%.
[00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:32.636]  What do you think this is going to be like?
[00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:33.776]  You think this is going to be fun?
[00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:41.000]  You think you're just going to silver surf through the whole deal and it's going to be cakes and lions and teddy bears and
[00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:43.376]  Unicorns?
[00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.478]  No, folks, it ain't gonna be Lucky Charms.
[00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:48.620]  They're engineering this whole thing.
[00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.002]  On purpose, and they admit they are.
[00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.604]  It's not like I'm just saying, oh, it's obviously engineered.
[00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:56.486]  They say they're collapsing everything.
[00:00:59.428 --> 00:01:03.851]  The UN admits 130-something million are gonna starve to death under a year of COVID lockdown.
[00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:05.612]  We're already eight months in, and guess what?
[00:01:05.692 --> 00:01:06.633]  Millions are starving to death.
[00:01:06.773 --> 00:01:09.655]  They just die in their sleep, folks, and they just say, oh, malnutrition.
[00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:18.148]  And then you'll be walking down the street and there's some arrogant black person going, you white people need to do something for us!
[00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.514]  You need to do something for everybody, it's disgusting!
[00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:25.055]  Like all these bloated, weird Black Lives Matter women that run everything.
[00:01:25.515 --> 00:01:27.737]  They don't say a word about death camps in China.
[00:01:27.777 --> 00:01:29.478]  They don't give a flying you-know-what.
[00:01:29.678 --> 00:01:32.020]  They're all a bunch of devil worship and trash.
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.581]  And it's all gonna go down now, folks.
[00:01:35.322 --> 00:01:38.203]  You understand that the lockdown's permanent.
[00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:39.404]  It never ends.
[00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:43.447]  It's about martial law control, forced inoculations, digital currencies.
[00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:46.448]  Everyone tattling and spying on you when you go around.
[00:01:46.768 --> 00:01:48.049]  It's the end of everything, folks.
[00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:54.411]  It's an authoritarian orgy because the megabanks stole all the money and are delusional that they're gonna merge the machines and become gods.
[00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:57.272]  And they've got op-eds everywhere about, let's get rid of all humans.
[00:01:57.593 --> 00:01:59.433]  COVID-19 shows were obsolete.
[00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:01.314]  And people just go, what is this?
[00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:02.835]  It's the cult, man!
[00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:08.697]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:12.679]  Okay, here's...
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.701]  The final equation.
[00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.263]  This is the end of the world as we know it.
[00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.567]  This is an overwrite of the entire biosphere and every species on the planet.
[00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:26.051]  I've studied the entire New World Order operation, and that's what it is.
[00:02:28.193 --> 00:02:35.679]  And everything has been psychologically war-gamed, where unless the public completely wakes up and rejects it all wholesale, it will succeed.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.583]  And of course we know that God will intervene at the end.
[00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:45.249]  And it is laid out because the group doing this is not the Supreme Being.
[00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.273]  It is a very nasty group of entities that the Bible tells us about.
[00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:52.135]  A military force.
[00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:57.219]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of everything.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.501]  It's never coming back.
[00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:01.103]  The prosperity's never coming back.
[00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:03.145]  It's all over.
[00:03:04.406 --> 00:03:06.648]  And they're gonna, by increments, put the pressure on
[00:03:07.984 --> 00:03:10.726]  Get you to give up more rights, and then they'll take a little pressure off.
[00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:15.869]  And then they'll tell you to give up more rights, and then pressure will be taken off.
[00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.791]  But then, always it'll be put back on even tighter.
[00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.772]  That's the psychology of the stakeholder.
[00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:32.319]  And to watch Bill Gates on all these TV shows, saying it's never coming back, it's gonna be really hurt bad, and he starts laughing and giggling with Bilderberg Group members.
[00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:37.382]  These people are openly evil, and they're not even hiding it.
[00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.893]  And they tell you, oh, you're going to have five shots a year just for COVID.
[00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:42.715]  And they're not going to help you.
[00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:45.718]  Oh, and vaccines do hurt you.
[00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.120]  We used to tell you they didn't hurt you.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.041]  You know, they do hurt you.
[00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:51.724]  Oh, and these new ones change your DNA.
[00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.427]  And we don't know what's going to happen, but we're just doing it.
[00:03:56.312 --> 00:04:10.542]  It's the psychology of Stockholm Syndrome, where they are shocking you and torturing you and getting you to do outrageous things, knowing you're going to bow to them and become a coward out of fear and rationalize what they're doing.
[00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:13.184]  So this is all a very deliberate operation.
[00:04:14.845 --> 00:04:17.567]  Like when they say, there is no such thing as Antifa.
[00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:19.589]  There is no violence in the streets.
[00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.752]  Give us $25 billion at the post office so we can rig the election.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:34.908]  If you don't give us $25 billion and have illegal mail-in voting, then you are a fascist, and we've got to have an emergency session in Congress during a campaign never before done.
[00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:40.573]  So it's all going over the edge.
[00:04:41.713 --> 00:04:48.158]  So the most important thing you can do, and I can do, is understand what Netflix is.
[00:04:49.073 --> 00:04:49.613]  Think about that.
[00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:52.575]  How there's really nothing old on Netflix.
[00:04:53.076 --> 00:05:00.961]  It's all new and all bad and all debilitating, so that everyone forgets the past, and now all the shows, they're wearing masks.
[00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:02.081]  And the video games.
[00:05:02.462 --> 00:05:04.243]  And the movies, suddenly, it's permanent.
[00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:18.292]  And if you'll have a suffocating mask over your face that rots your teeth and doesn't protect you and gives you hypoxia and all the rest of it, and you don't get enough air, and it lowers your oxygen by 20%, that alone causes brain damage long-term.
[00:05:19.997 --> 00:05:22.039]  They can do anything, and they admit.
[00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.161]  Gates came out and said, here's the future.
[00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:33.770]  Forced inoculations, tracking everywhere you go, and sorry, we're going to get rid of the terrorism industry pretty much, and that's just, we're going to have a post-industrial world.
[00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.034]  So the headline at InfoWars.com today is,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.281]  The lockdown is never going to end.
[00:05:41.421 --> 00:05:45.002]  Welcome to the post-industrial world, which is the post-human world.
[00:05:45.362 --> 00:05:46.622]  And it's all in the agenda 21.
[00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:48.002]  It's all in agenda 2030.
[00:05:48.082 --> 00:05:48.803]  It's all public.
[00:05:48.943 --> 00:05:51.043]  And they even say on the news, Oh, it's for the earth now.
[00:05:51.103 --> 00:05:53.084]  And it's teaching us to redistribute wealth.
[00:05:53.984 --> 00:05:59.286]  Uh, yeah, to the ultra rich and the public has lost God.
[00:05:59.306 --> 00:06:00.466]  So they've lost a mooring.
[00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:08.048]  And so mental illness and insanity is spreading like wildfire and
[00:06:10.663 --> 00:06:12.463]  Guard your soul, folks, that's all I can tell you.
[00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:14.644]  Guard your soul above everything else.
[00:06:14.684 --> 00:06:16.604]  Fear not who can kill the body, but he can kill the soul.
[00:06:17.785 --> 00:06:19.825]  This is just gonna be one hell of a nightmare.
[00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:27.587]  But in the end, all of the delusion will be removed, and every head will bow, every knee will bend to God.
[00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:30.007]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:06:32.468 --> 00:06:33.928]  I don't come here with bad news.
[00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:36.509]  I just come here with the simple, plain facts.
[00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:45.495]  We're on a planet, hurtling through deep space, orbiting a beautiful sun, given all these gifts by our Creator, but we have free will.
[00:06:46.555 --> 00:07:06.048]  And so, there is a spirit, a program, an operation that seeks to enslave us and turn us into gnome-like, suboid servants that will build a universe in the image of Lucifer.
[00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:09.736]  And that's what we're in the middle of.
[00:07:11.217 --> 00:07:21.021]  So again, thank you for joining us on this live, teleprompter-free, August 17th, 2020 worldwide transmission.
[00:07:23.783 --> 00:07:27.464]  Oh, I've got a lot of interesting news, a lot of amazing little factoids and things to cover.
[00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:36.388]  There's always the cotton candy of the Durham investigation and, you know, the popcorn of
[00:07:38.237 --> 00:07:43.502]  People being jerked out of their vehicles and beaten to death or half to death or shot in the head and the media saying it's good.
[00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:53.612]  And there's all the wondrous cancer statistics of pediatric cancer up 50,000% from what it was in the 60s.
[00:07:56.035 --> 00:08:01.941]  And there's all the myriad censorship and control and AI overlords watching our every move.
[00:08:04.008 --> 00:08:12.715]  And all the Skeksy-like servants of the devil cackling and hissing and slithering around all completely empty and alone.
[00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:18.140]  Now there's the headline, the lockdown is permanent.
[00:08:19.021 --> 00:08:21.863]  Welcome to the post-industrial world, Monday Live.
[00:08:22.384 --> 00:08:27.388]  Bill Gates has publicly announced that the lockdown will never end and forced inoculations are on the way.
[00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.971]  And you watch that video with him on Fareed Zakaria.
[00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:33.812]  Let's play the next segment.
[00:08:35.893 --> 00:08:38.874]  Fareed reads the script back at him and says, it's really bad.
[00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:39.915]  It's going to last years.
[00:08:40.355 --> 00:08:41.196]  People need to get used to it.
[00:08:41.236 --> 00:08:42.697]  And Gates starts getting really excited.
[00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:48.420]  And if you read the fine print of what he says, he goes, well, it never goes back to normal.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:55.464]  But in the industrialized areas, you're going to be allowed to go to a restaurant by the middle of 21.
[00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:09.806]  2021.
[00:09:00.719 --> 00:09:09.806]  And, oh, but, you know, the smaller businesses are going to have to be closed forever and only travel that's essential is going to be allowed.
[00:09:09.867 --> 00:09:12.188]  And you're going to have to take a microchip to do that.
[00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.870]  And it's all being announced by his surrogates.
[00:09:17.292 --> 00:09:27.761]  And then he comes and announces most of it on TV, but then has his surrogates say, oh, but you don't know Jeffrey Epstein and oh, you don't want to put a microchip in anybody.
[00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:29.122]  And Bill Gates is like, that's right.
[00:09:30.165 --> 00:09:31.907]  Because it's not called a microchip.
[00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:33.549]  It's nanotech.
[00:09:36.193 --> 00:09:38.295]  And if you actually read the tech publications, it's everywhere.
[00:09:39.477 --> 00:09:41.239]  The future of tech is in your skin.
[00:09:42.228 --> 00:09:43.149]  Everybody's gonna get it.
[00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:44.009]  It's just a bandage.
[00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:44.730]  It's so easy.
[00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.051]  And it just puts little chips into your skin.
[00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:48.232]  They work their way in.
[00:09:48.312 --> 00:09:48.952]  Yay!
[00:09:48.972 --> 00:09:53.575]  Imagine if aliens landed and said, Come, if you want your food, put on this patch.
[00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:54.116]  It's easy.
[00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:55.797]  I'm putting something in you to help you.
[00:09:56.037 --> 00:09:56.938]  It's just a tattoo.
[00:09:57.198 --> 00:09:58.659]  You know, tattoos are fun.
[00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.140]  But you can't see this one.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.460]  But the computer can.
[00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:02.661]  Everything's fine.
[00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:03.422]  We're your friends.
[00:10:04.823 --> 00:10:10.947]  And now, oh, in Europe and in China, when you show up at the grocery store,
[00:10:11.843 --> 00:10:17.024]  They weigh you to decide if you're too fat to get food, and it's all on your social credit score.
[00:10:17.244 --> 00:10:19.165]  But then when they first do it, they apologize.
[00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:22.386]  Oh, we don't know why the government had people out at the grocery store.
[00:10:23.606 --> 00:10:24.907]  It was a test gone wrong.
[00:10:25.127 --> 00:10:27.527]  And then the next time, well, yeah, we're doing it.
[00:10:27.547 --> 00:10:33.029]  Because see, they know when they announce, hey, we're going to be there weighing you at the grocery store or the restaurant.
[00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:34.529]  You know, that's crazy.
[00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:35.669]  I'm going to fight that.
[00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:36.870]  They go, oh, we're doing it.
[00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:37.490]  Oh, it's an accident.
[00:10:38.595 --> 00:10:41.116]  And that way, okay, and the next time, oh, we are doing it, but not everybody.
[00:10:41.316 --> 00:10:42.596]  You get a coupon if you let us do it.
[00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:44.497]  And then, oh, everybody has to do it.
[00:10:44.517 --> 00:10:48.458]  And if you don't want to, you can go sign up over here, we'll put you on a list.
[00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:50.419]  Oh, you don't want the vaccine?
[00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:51.940]  Sure, just get on a list over here.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.001]  Oh, sorry, we're sending contact tracers to your house to take your kids, because you're not giving them the inoculation.
[00:10:57.161 --> 00:10:58.482]  It's all been battle planned.
[00:10:58.962 --> 00:11:00.603]  But they know how to get our laziness.
[00:11:03.384 --> 00:11:04.744]  They know how to manipulate that.
[00:11:06.685 --> 00:11:07.445]  They know how to
[00:11:10.006 --> 00:11:13.168]  Incrementally get us to put the chains on ourselves.
[00:11:13.348 --> 00:11:24.775]  So the chains are going on and the stated plan by the United Nations and by the Club of Rome and by the Bilderberg Group and by the Davos Group is a post-human world.
[00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:27.096]  And they're now externalizing the hierarchy.
[00:11:27.557 --> 00:11:28.597]  They're externalizing the method.
[00:11:28.617 --> 00:11:35.481]  They're externalizing the inner cult vision of, hey, like I told you in Endgame, low level, they say we're going to kill 80%.
[00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:38.283]  Oh, you're part of the 20%.
[00:11:39.923 --> 00:11:40.383]  You'll be alright.
[00:11:40.403 --> 00:11:41.965]  And then, higher level, they go, well, it's really about 90.
[00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:45.808]  Dr. Pianca was 90% killed, head of the biology department at the time at UT.
[00:11:45.848 --> 00:11:52.093]  And then one of his graduate students that works at a level 4 bioweapon lab in California, she wrote an op-ed saying, listen, Pianca's too liberal.
[00:11:52.514 --> 00:11:53.594]  Humans are a parasite.
[00:11:53.855 --> 00:11:55.916]  We're going to transcend our bodies and merge with machines.
[00:11:56.337 --> 00:11:57.798]  And then she works at a bioweapon facility.
[00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:07.006]  So, see, that's not 12 Monkeys, a fictional movie where the exterminist animal rights activist wants to depopulate the Earth, and he works at a
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.021]  Bioweapon Lab.
[00:12:09.642 --> 00:12:13.386]  They really work at the Bioweapon Labs, and they tell you, we don't kill your ass!
[00:12:15.828 --> 00:12:17.290]  And Bill Gates says there's too many of us.
[00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:26.860]  And then Bill Gates is our doctor now, and it's all Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, New York Times, CNN, ABC, NBC, every channel, BBC.
[00:12:27.061 --> 00:12:28.762]  It's just even in China, Bill Gates is on the TV.
[00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:33.102]  And he's like, and you're going to have this, and you're going to take the inoculation.
[00:12:33.322 --> 00:12:36.443]  Adults get five, children get two, and there's going to be new plagues.
[00:12:36.724 --> 00:12:37.864]  Terrorists are about to release it.
[00:12:37.904 --> 00:12:38.824]  This was really a drill.
[00:12:39.164 --> 00:12:41.305]  And then everybody's smiling and laughing.
[00:12:41.425 --> 00:12:43.346]  And Stephen Colbert, you can tell, is totally scared.
[00:12:44.867 --> 00:12:50.269]  And they all agree to him, because they're all, now know, oh, they were never going to get rid of 80%.
[00:12:52.289 --> 00:12:54.030]  They're going to kill everybody.
[00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.012]  Because the way this thing works is one person gets to live.
[00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:04.301]  If there were two New World Order globalists in a tower, they would kill each other.
[00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:06.582]  Now you're entering the mind of Satan.
[00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:09.684]  Satan doesn't want slaves.
[00:13:10.004 --> 00:13:11.484]  Satan wants you dead!
[00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:21.890]  The ultimate control is to kill you so that you cannot develop and then die
[00:13:23.513 --> 00:13:25.394]  And then your spirit transcend to the next level.
[00:13:25.954 --> 00:13:33.718]  It needs to put you into an artificial reality, totally make you satanic and evil, kill your body to trap you with it forever.
[00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:44.384]  And Satan wants to be able to operate in multi-dimensions, and so we are the gateway for Satan to run that operation.
[00:13:44.704 --> 00:13:47.606]  And so that's why all these fools, the left thinks, oh,
[00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:51.186]  We're locking things down to defeat Trump.
[00:13:51.466 --> 00:13:52.527]  That's just one facet.
[00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:54.069]  This plan has been on the shelf for decades.
[00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.629]  They admit it.
[00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.391]  They're implementing it now.
[00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:57.672]  They're tailoring it for politics.
[00:13:57.992 --> 00:13:59.414]  But it's for everybody.
[00:13:59.774 --> 00:14:02.476]  And it's the left that's losing their jobs the most.
[00:14:02.637 --> 00:14:03.617]  It's in the highest crime.
[00:14:03.678 --> 00:14:04.438]  It's living in hell.
[00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:05.860]  But again, like Stockholm.
[00:14:07.233 --> 00:14:11.314]  They go out and rage against people in the countryside or people that have a farm.
[00:14:11.334 --> 00:14:12.035]  You see all the news.
[00:14:12.075 --> 00:14:14.816]  Yeah, the pieces of crap live in rural areas.
[00:14:15.236 --> 00:14:17.697]  They're out in sunshine and walking on their own property.
[00:14:17.897 --> 00:14:20.758]  Yeah, because their families were smart and didn't want to live in a big evil city.
[00:14:22.318 --> 00:14:26.660]  And they may live in a shack, but they're living better than the richest person in some devilish high-rise.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.561]  And it's all going to be taken.
[00:14:29.841 --> 00:14:31.221]  So, the move.
[00:14:31.281 --> 00:14:32.321]  I was a selfish person.
[00:14:32.902 --> 00:14:34.122]  I'd sell everything I got.
[00:14:35.723 --> 00:14:36.043]  I'd get
[00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:46.857]  Plastic surgery, and I would run to somewhere like the inner mountain region of the western part of the United States, and you'd never see me again.
[00:14:47.257 --> 00:14:57.766]  I'd be 100 miles from nowhere, behind a hill, with a shack, and then a bunker underneath it, and with a radio.
[00:14:58.874 --> 00:14:59.755]  And a little farm.
[00:15:00.195 --> 00:15:01.597]  Gone, gone, gone.
[00:15:01.957 --> 00:15:07.603]  And that's the wimpy thing to do, but not join Satan, but run and hide.
[00:15:07.723 --> 00:15:08.704]  And they're gonna come there.
[00:15:08.904 --> 00:15:10.005]  The robots are gonna come there.
[00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:11.287]  The drones are gonna come there.
[00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.335]  And that's why none of the globals are having children.
[00:15:20.506 --> 00:15:24.329]  Because they're already scared enough themselves, the ones that aren't pure Satanists, and they know it's over.
[00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:25.310]  It's over.
[00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.391]  Well, you know what?
[00:15:26.471 --> 00:15:27.712]  I'm having more children if I can.
[00:15:27.792 --> 00:15:31.114]  I'm doubling down on God, and on our children, and on us.
[00:15:31.655 --> 00:15:38.500]  Because I need to put them in the world, because I love them so much, so that they are in danger to this, so I don't bow down to Satan.
[00:15:39.061 --> 00:15:40.382]  Because it's their soul that matters.
[00:15:42.281 --> 00:15:43.281]  That's how you're all in.
[00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:45.462]  You don't hide in the ground.
[00:15:46.063 --> 00:15:46.843]  You stand up.
[00:15:46.903 --> 00:15:53.546]  Now, if you've got a family and it's your mission to protect yourselves and get out, get out and then support the resistance as much as you can.
[00:15:53.566 --> 00:15:54.966]  There's ways to be balanced about it.
[00:15:55.406 --> 00:16:03.370]  I'm just simply telling you, ladies and gentlemen, that giving up on society and civilization is what the enemy wants to really capture us and accelerate this.
[00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:09.031]  Satan's going to get his one year or so of power and going to kill billions of people.
[00:16:09.731 --> 00:16:11.152]  But in the end, they're going to be defeated.
[00:16:11.172 --> 00:16:13.412]  This whole AI thing is going down and Bill Gates will pay.
[00:16:15.353 --> 00:16:17.473]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:16:18.113 --> 00:16:20.774]  Websites are Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:24.035]  So here's how it works.
[00:16:26.916 --> 00:16:32.357]  When somebody gets straight A's across the board in high school and
[00:16:34.448 --> 00:16:37.270]  They've got databases on genealogies and a lot of other things they do.
[00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:42.353]  You get approached to go to one of these advanced academies at a college.
[00:16:44.494 --> 00:16:47.976]  And then larger groups get tested there for aptitude.
[00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:58.602]  And then when you're about 15 or 16, they recruit you to be part of a scientific force trying to save the earth.
[00:17:00.066 --> 00:17:19.933]  And so, you've been brought in, you're saving the Earth, you're a good guy, and by increments they have a psychological table where they walk you into the position, by the time you're about 18, that you believe that we have to take control of the planet, we have to reduce the population because we're the ruling class, and that eugenics is the way to go because humanity is degenerating and falling apart.
[00:17:22.048 --> 00:17:38.217]  And then, of course, they don't explain to you that they're engineering the culture crisis and breaking up the family and putting things in the water to lower IQ and greasing the skids for the decadence that was already going to come in an industrial society that takes people off the land where they have to work to produce their own food.
[00:17:40.278 --> 00:17:50.924]  And so they didn't just build this industrial system by accident and make it to where babies
[00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:53.329]  Sleep in cribs.
[00:17:53.409 --> 00:17:54.490]  Babies get formulas.
[00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:56.771]  Babies get vaccines.
[00:17:56.831 --> 00:17:58.171]  Babies get removed from their parents.
[00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:00.012]  Babies are disassociated.
[00:18:00.592 --> 00:18:06.255]  Babies are basically more like robots by the time they grow up because they've been dehumanized.
[00:18:08.096 --> 00:18:18.400]  There was a track of the Renaissance building machines, building science, building the Gutenberg Press 500 and something years ago that caused an enlightenment.
[00:18:19.568 --> 00:18:31.698]  But parallel to the Enlightenment was the dark force twisting the light so that it would be able to then get full control of us and make us dependent on it.
[00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:39.144]  And so now they are destroying the old Renaissance track and they're jumping us over to the train to hell.
[00:18:40.445 --> 00:18:49.032]  And that's really what I just wanted to get across to everybody that lying to yourself about this and living in denial is only going to make it worse.
[00:18:51.158 --> 00:18:57.824]  And again, I read this stuff 30 years ago and found it absolutely wild and thought the elite's delusional.
[00:18:58.084 --> 00:18:59.786]  They really won't try to pull this off.
[00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:03.869]  But then I watched them pull it off, pull it off, pull it off.
[00:19:04.169 --> 00:19:11.176]  And then I'm like, oh, they're about five, six years behind their 2020 to launch the beginning of the post-industrial world, the depopulation, the end of the family.
[00:19:11.196 --> 00:19:14.939]  In the UK, they arrest you if you say there aren't
[00:19:16.303 --> 00:19:17.204]  Unlimited genders?
[00:19:18.184 --> 00:19:19.745]  Because they're going to have human robots.
[00:19:19.765 --> 00:19:20.826]  They're going to have clones.
[00:19:21.847 --> 00:19:29.511]  And they're going to say that they've all got rights.
[00:19:31.353 --> 00:19:35.435]  Because the government and the system will speak for them, and they'll be programmed by the system.
[00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:43.000]  The corporations want to build crops of humans as the machines, just like Blade Runner.
[00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.932]  But that's only one level of the deception.
[00:19:46.992 --> 00:19:55.358]  That's the technocrats, the transhumanists that want to live forever being told, oh, there's too many people, they're dumbed down, we gotta get rid of most of them.
[00:19:56.659 --> 00:20:01.202]  And then once we've gotten rid of most of them, you know, there'll be a new golden future.
[00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:11.590]  And it'll be like Zardoz, where we'll have these hunter-killers that go out and keep the population of the wild humans down, and then we're gonna live
[00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:16.541]  In these advanced estates, more like in the ancient Greek times or Elysium.
[00:20:19.523 --> 00:20:22.805]  And you go, where did they come up with a movie like Zardoz with Sean Connery?
[00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:24.466]  And we can run some of the trailer.
[00:20:26.968 --> 00:20:33.832]  Well, that was, that came out right after the Club of Rome created its secret report in the early 1960s.
[00:20:33.892 --> 00:20:37.414]  And by then it was public and they circulated and they made a movie about it.
[00:20:38.817 --> 00:20:42.480]  Now, of course, that was getting old elitist in the 60s to sign on to.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.623]  We're going to kill almost everybody and we'll hunt down the other people's Hunger Games original.
[00:20:48.444 --> 00:20:52.207]  And then we'll just be elites on our beautiful plantations and live forever.
[00:20:53.428 --> 00:20:55.069]  And so they kind of bought into that worldview.
[00:20:55.889 --> 00:21:00.072]  But now that you get closer to it, they go, nah, all humans are really parasites.
[00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:01.593]  We have to get rid of the species.
[00:21:02.674 --> 00:21:04.335]  Well, who is behind this?
[00:21:04.375 --> 00:21:07.538]  You don't just think another human is directing this to you.
[00:21:09.022 --> 00:21:12.385]  This is Hitler squared to infinity.
[00:21:12.885 --> 00:21:14.306]  That's where all of this is going.
[00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:24.774]  And we're being completely and totally domesticated for that.
[00:21:25.255 --> 00:21:34.182]  And I can sit here and I can cover other news and I can talk about
[00:21:35.768 --> 00:21:41.250]  This or that, or this interesting factoid, or how they're not going to have the debates, they're going to be video conference, we knew that was coming.
[00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:49.834]  But, it's all window dressing.
[00:21:51.775 --> 00:21:53.435]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's all it is.
[00:21:58.838 --> 00:22:01.559]  So, I sit there and I look at Bill Gates.
[00:22:03.159 --> 00:22:04.320]  What Hitler wished he could be.
[00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:18.048]  And I just sit here and I watch how the public's been turned so evil like their masters that it'll be a blessing when everybody gets killed.
[00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:38.739]  Because that's how this weird sick Illuminati balance works is they get us to be evil, they get us to be selfish, they get us to go along and say we're heroes wearing masks, they get us to bind our own destruction, and then by the time we are all destroying ourselves, they sit back and they laugh about it when they help set the whole thing up.
[00:22:40.043 --> 00:22:42.265]  And that's how they metaphysically think that they get away with it.
[00:22:48.650 --> 00:23:02.121]  And, you know, I've said this before, I can see their Darwinian, social Darwinian angles from a scientific perspective, but it's all false data, because they're the worst people on earth, their kids commit suicide at record levels, they're totally unhappy.
[00:23:03.578 --> 00:23:06.280]  I've been around some of these billionaire kids, I mean the real ones, okay?
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.183]  You're talking cursed people, all of them.
[00:23:09.203 --> 00:23:10.844]  They're cursed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:12.886 --> 00:23:14.727]  And Trump knows joining them is a curse.
[00:23:14.767 --> 00:23:16.128]  It's why he's not in bed with them.
[00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.453]  But he's got one leg with him, one leg out, because that's what it is to be on this planet now.
[00:23:25.516 --> 00:23:29.360]  And so, you've got the twisted version of the hierarchy,
[00:23:30.347 --> 00:23:50.351]  Up on top, and then as you go down the hierarchy, it just gets more disgusting and a more stupid version of what's on top, to where they force those of us that are not part of the Illuminati to be in the same position, looking at our watch, knowing how bad it's going to get, and going, right about now, they're going to release that bioweapon and wipe most of these guys out.
[00:23:50.411 --> 00:23:51.571]  Damn, I wish we could have woke them up.
[00:23:51.911 --> 00:23:57.032]  But let me just get below ground as quickly as possible and hope they don't send hunter-killer robots in here in six months to get me.
[00:23:58.462 --> 00:23:59.362]  I mean, that's basically it.
[00:23:59.783 --> 00:24:01.063]  We're all writing our own death warrant.
[00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:03.024]  I mean, listen, you're all dead.
[00:24:03.724 --> 00:24:04.665]  Most of you are dead already.
[00:24:04.685 --> 00:24:05.345]  They already put it in you.
[00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:24.734]  Submitting to the incremental bending of our will until we're more akin to silly putty than men and women must be resisted.
[00:24:26.411 --> 00:24:32.795]  This is not a social contract where there's a neighborhood pool and everyone agrees not to take a dump in it.
[00:24:33.856 --> 00:24:36.557]  Because now there's a phenomenon where adults just crap in pools.
[00:24:36.597 --> 00:24:37.798]  People are so lazy and selfish.
[00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:40.160]  That's what decadence is.
[00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:51.087]  When your culture is being fastidious and having a really good social contract and really standing up for each other, then deviance becomes the thing.
[00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:52.751]  Like, take Japan.
[00:24:53.232 --> 00:24:58.334]  You can leave your Rolex watch out at a restaurant, come back in an hour, it'll be sitting right there on the table.
[00:24:58.794 --> 00:25:03.236]  When they have earthquakes and tsunamis, the crime rate goes from almost nothing to zero.
[00:25:03.856 --> 00:25:06.757]  People don't take advantage when things are tough.
[00:25:09.158 --> 00:25:20.783]  But, they have shops and things and degeneracies I didn't even know existed, because as the culture begins to break down, as the family breaks down, they are turning into
[00:25:22.944 --> 00:25:27.705]  bifurcated people where they have this evil side, this devilish side that is into total degeneracy.
[00:25:29.886 --> 00:25:32.507]  And the left sells this argument, oh you gotta feed that side.
[00:25:33.687 --> 00:25:35.047]  No, you don't want to feed that side.
[00:25:36.388 --> 00:25:48.911]  You want to be conscious of that and realize what it is and that it's not part of your real system and that you have all these other destinies to be carried out that are going to take self-sacrifice.
[00:25:49.771 --> 00:25:51.472]  And it's because you're not sacrificing
[00:25:52.639 --> 00:25:56.481]  And you're not ascending, that your body then starts to want to kill you.
[00:25:58.241 --> 00:26:05.104]  And you start to be depressed, you start to hate yourself, because you're not being strong, you're not standing up, you're not doing what you're supposed to do.
[00:26:08.446 --> 00:26:10.867]  You know, plants don't grow and live very long in zero gravity.
[00:26:11.847 --> 00:26:13.028]  They just spin around in circles.
[00:26:14.248 --> 00:26:18.130]  If a plant doesn't get some wind on it, it never becomes strong.
[00:26:20.708 --> 00:26:30.474]  But they want to raise us inside these little greenhouses for the act of fully and completely conquering us forever.
[00:26:31.874 --> 00:26:33.555]  And there was just a horrible article.
[00:26:33.575 --> 00:26:34.556]  In fact, it's in the stack from yesterday.
[00:26:34.576 --> 00:26:35.396]  Will you guys grab it for me?
[00:26:37.498 --> 00:26:41.660]  How China defeated the coronavirus and what they did right.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:49.485]  And it's a big shot of a domed city in China where the party elites go and live outside of the smog and
[00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:54.374]  Dead bodies and roaches and open sewers.
[00:26:56.494 --> 00:26:59.595]  And it's all about how you want to get into that Dome City.
[00:27:01.096 --> 00:27:03.496]  They're the place that gave us COVID, but they're the Dome City.
[00:27:03.716 --> 00:27:04.436]  They're the answer.
[00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:06.857]  See, it's an inversion of reality.
[00:27:08.157 --> 00:27:11.078]  And Google and Apple and all these groups
[00:27:12.495 --> 00:27:22.604]  It turned out, for six, seven years, are secretly buying up all the land in Denver, in Toronto, in Austin, and other areas.
[00:27:23.885 --> 00:27:27.649]  And also, middle of nowhere, West Virginia, to build domed cities.
[00:27:27.689 --> 00:27:28.069]  There it is.
[00:27:31.593 --> 00:27:33.935]  To build domed cities.
[00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.358]  So that you can be safe from the COVID.
[00:27:40.758 --> 00:27:43.760]  Oh, you'll get inoculated, you'll get face scanned, you'll get checked.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:50.323]  And then of course, COVID will never make it into the city because they'll lie and say it never did.
[00:27:50.383 --> 00:27:53.345]  Because they can call it COVID if they want, they can not call it if they want.
[00:27:53.445 --> 00:27:56.527]  It's like New Zealand saying, oh, we haven't had one case in three months.
[00:27:56.707 --> 00:28:00.729]  Oh, we had four cases, we're suspending the election and locking everything down.
[00:28:04.588 --> 00:28:09.091]  The whole endgame is putting us into an artificial system.
[00:28:09.411 --> 00:28:19.358]  Why do you think the CIA-funded seminal film of George Lucas, THX 1138, was about?
[00:28:19.978 --> 00:28:23.941]  That was his student film that he then remade with Robert Duvall.
[00:28:25.188 --> 00:28:26.249]  In his first major movie.
[00:28:26.429 --> 00:28:42.437]  You see, you have Robert Duvall in your movie, and it's your living underground with the psychiatry tyranny over you, and they're breaking up, they're ending the family, and everyone's four-strugged, everybody has shaved heads, everybody wears the same uniforms, and why are they living underground?
[00:28:42.457 --> 00:28:49.100]  Well, you learn, Lucas didn't put it in the film, but in the postulate, that of course he didn't come up with,
[00:28:50.879 --> 00:28:53.100]  There's been a bioweapon above ground.
[00:28:53.401 --> 00:28:57.183]  So this is a civilization a hundred years after it goes underground.
[00:29:00.686 --> 00:29:04.928]  And then you see it again in the movie The Island that came out in the early 2000s.
[00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:12.714]  And everyone thinks that, oh, they're lucky to live on the island because the bioweapon killed almost everybody on Earth.
[00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:25.783]  But once a week somebody wins the lottery to go from this island that's not very comfortable to this luxury island where they're repopulating the earth on this island where you can finally be outdoors again.
[00:29:27.163 --> 00:29:32.085]  There's hundreds of these books, hundreds of these movies to pre-program you.
[00:29:32.885 --> 00:29:41.848]  Predictive programming is what it's called because even though it's scary when you sit there eating popcorn, eating a hot dog, and drinking a big old large delicious Coca-Cola,
[00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:47.454]  And you're watching clones getting grabbed and harvested and, you know, because they're really clones.
[00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:52.538]  And you're watching all this tyranny, but you're sitting there eating a hot dog.
[00:29:52.658 --> 00:30:01.905]  Your brain, at the cellular synapse level, associates it as non-threatening.
[00:30:05.725 --> 00:30:11.790]  It's like being raised and, you know, watching tigers eat zebras all day, but you eat pizza and drink Jack Daniels while you watch it.
[00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:18.035]  You know, you'd think, hell, you'd associate tigers eating a gazelle or a zebra as good, except it's gonna eat you.
[00:30:19.657 --> 00:30:31.107]  So the slasher movies, the death, you're all desensitized so that when the real thing comes or your neighbor's being drug off, you don't say anything because it's just more entertainment.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.400]  It's just more death.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:34.941]  It's just more abortion.
[00:30:35.341 --> 00:30:36.001]  And so they tell you.
[00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:37.521]  Yeah, we need to riot more.
[00:30:37.581 --> 00:30:38.981]  Yeah, white people are inherently evil.
[00:30:39.322 --> 00:30:41.622]  Yeah, we need to keep babies alive and harvest their organs.
[00:30:41.822 --> 00:30:42.942]  And there's a lot of money in that.
[00:30:42.982 --> 00:30:44.002]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:30:44.323 --> 00:30:46.703]  The mother makes the decision whether the child has value.
[00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:48.523]  She says it doesn't.
[00:30:48.563 --> 00:30:50.064]  We go, we are not resuscitating.
[00:30:50.244 --> 00:30:50.964]  The baby's alive.
[00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:55.545]  But the term is... Resuscitate.
[00:30:57.845 --> 00:31:00.206]  It's a legal term in the Bioethics Board of the UN.
[00:31:00.606 --> 00:31:00.846]  You know.
[00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.830]  The death panels.
[00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.491]  But people get upset about that.
[00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:06.091]  That's Bill Gates.
[00:31:10.032 --> 00:31:17.033]  If we don't give that last year of health care to that older lady who's a patient, we could hire ten teachers.
[00:31:17.513 --> 00:31:18.834]  But that's a death panel.
[00:31:19.314 --> 00:31:23.415]  And so, people don't like it when I say, yeah, yeah, yeah, and they people clap.
[00:31:23.435 --> 00:31:25.275]  They're like, I get some money.
[00:31:25.295 --> 00:31:27.136]  I get some money.
[00:31:27.536 --> 00:31:28.616]  Kill the granny.
[00:31:32.125 --> 00:31:34.726]  But we're not talking about an old lady deciding to not get cancer surgery.
[00:31:34.746 --> 00:31:35.686]  We're talking about, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:31:35.966 --> 00:31:39.107]  He's training you that less is more.
[00:31:39.307 --> 00:31:41.788]  He's training you that we're not going to have an infrastructure anymore.
[00:31:42.228 --> 00:31:43.268]  You're not going to have police.
[00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:45.789]  You're not going to have doctors for you.
[00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:56.613]  That's for folks that have a high social credit score and are like rock stars that live in the new super cities that are so cool to be in, the dome cities.
[00:31:56.853 --> 00:32:00.514]  But of course, the real establishment is going to be out at Armored Compounds, you know, in Northern Canada.
[00:32:02.418 --> 00:32:03.238]  That's really where they're going.
[00:32:05.459 --> 00:32:08.559]  They got some decoy facilities and stuff around the world, but they're up in Canada.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.920]  They're being watched very closely.
[00:32:13.321 --> 00:32:14.621]  And none of them are going to escape.
[00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:18.262]  They're not going to escape their controller that wants to kill every one of them.
[00:32:19.022 --> 00:32:23.083]  And they're under the wings of just an absolutely savage entity.
[00:32:23.763 --> 00:32:28.164]  With just a vicious will that just... The devil doesn't just want the planet.
[00:32:28.944 --> 00:32:29.565]  It hates us.
[00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:30.885]  We're a more advanced life form.
[00:32:31.906 --> 00:32:33.407]  We're just at an embryonic level.
[00:32:33.807 --> 00:32:38.371]  And he's looking at this larva going, that's frickin' the... That's the big guy right there.
[00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:39.652]  He made these damn things.
[00:32:40.473 --> 00:32:41.774]  God, look how powerful they are.
[00:32:41.794 --> 00:32:44.676]  If I can just get control of them, they'll build whatever I want.
[00:32:45.497 --> 00:32:48.139]  I'm gonna tear them inside out before I flush them down the toilet.
[00:32:48.319 --> 00:32:50.080]  Cause I'm gonna beat this guy.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.643]  And that's Satan in a nutshell, folks.
[00:32:56.165 --> 00:32:57.006]  So God says, alright.
[00:32:57.926 --> 00:32:59.047]  Have your way with my larva.
[00:32:59.087 --> 00:32:59.828]  Just make some tougher.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.620]  I'm with the big guy.
[00:33:03.181 --> 00:33:03.881]  I'm with the plan.
[00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:05.142]  I'm on the program.
[00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:05.802]  I get it.
[00:33:06.483 --> 00:33:07.063]  I understand it.
[00:33:08.524 --> 00:33:09.665]  Time to join God, folks.
[00:33:10.085 --> 00:33:11.406]  Get off the planet, go next level.
[00:33:11.666 --> 00:33:12.326]  Let's do it together.
[00:33:12.346 --> 00:33:13.247]  It's all a big test.
[00:33:13.507 --> 00:33:14.847]  Say no to Bill Gates, say no to Satan.
[00:33:16.889 --> 00:33:17.689]  All right, welcome back.
[00:33:17.769 --> 00:33:18.690]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.370]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:20.511]  Hopefully you're spreading the word.
[00:33:21.972 --> 00:33:27.615]  If you just tuned in, you're driving down the road, listening to some local radio station, you think, what in the world is this I'm listening to?
[00:33:28.936 --> 00:33:30.236]  Listen, I wish it wasn't true.
[00:33:31.537 --> 00:33:33.117]  You can go research what I'm telling you.
[00:33:33.137 --> 00:33:37.378]  You can watch my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:33:37.438 --> 00:33:38.598]  It's still on YouTube.
[00:33:39.078 --> 00:33:44.080]  They took it off Amazon because it had five stars and tens of thousands of downloads.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:52.021]  They called it hate speech because it exposed the Nazi government, where the Nazis came from, Planned Parenthood.
[00:33:52.081 --> 00:33:53.902]  And so, yes, literally a film.
[00:33:54.775 --> 00:33:58.917]  That starts with the Nazis and goes through the history that came before it.
[00:34:00.158 --> 00:34:01.279]  That was removed for hate speech.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.101]  Watch that film made 13 years ago.
[00:34:08.423 --> 00:34:10.344]  There's in-game blueprint level of enslavement.
[00:34:10.364 --> 00:34:11.124]  They want you dead.
[00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:14.026]  World government's just the beginning.
[00:34:14.066 --> 00:34:15.326]  The endgame is you're dead.
[00:34:17.308 --> 00:34:21.410]  And I describe exactly the plan in their own writings, their own words, and their own videos.
[00:34:25.168 --> 00:34:26.008]  So just remember that.
[00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.070]  And you'll watch it and you're like, wow, 90% of this has come true.
[00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:30.371]  Yeah.
[00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:32.151]  And then you want the rest to come true?
[00:34:32.171 --> 00:34:35.813]  And I've said it a thousand times, I'll say it again.
[00:34:37.134 --> 00:34:51.661]  If I read the cheat sheet for college, say for Moby Dick, then I'm not surprised when Ahab goes down with the whale at the end, if I actually read the whole book.
[00:34:52.261 --> 00:34:53.662]  Because I read the ending.
[00:34:56.044 --> 00:35:03.310]  So, I know what they're going to do next because they've got a giant industrial, cultural, economic, spiritual, genetic plan.
[00:35:05.191 --> 00:35:08.614]  And I understand with Stockholm Syndrome, people are like, I don't want to admit that.
[00:35:09.475 --> 00:35:10.436]  I want to go play golf.
[00:35:11.717 --> 00:35:12.517]  I want to go swimming.
[00:35:12.557 --> 00:35:13.518]  I want to go to the bar.
[00:35:13.558 --> 00:35:14.439]  I want to... Hey, guess what?
[00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:15.720]  You're not going to do any of that soon.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.722]  Worldwide depression, war in the streets, hell on earth.
[00:35:20.303 --> 00:35:23.346]  A dystopian fascist slash communist technocracy.
[00:35:25.046 --> 00:35:28.628]  China is the model just to begin with.
[00:35:29.149 --> 00:35:31.430]  And they're coming for one thing, your children.
[00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:34.272]  Because they want to mold them into a nightmare.
[00:35:34.572 --> 00:35:42.637]  And they want to tear them psychically, spiritually, limb from limb, slowly.
[00:35:44.519 --> 00:35:50.082]  They want to take the image of God and tear it apart.
[00:35:53.004 --> 00:35:54.225]  So I'll cover temporal.
[00:35:55.697 --> 00:35:57.378]  Little focus news next hour.
[00:35:58.658 --> 00:36:00.198]  Oh, let's look at this, and let's look at that.
[00:36:00.438 --> 00:36:11.402]  But all of it is the fetid, stinking, scrofulous-covered droppings of Satanism.
[00:36:15.323 --> 00:36:17.904]  And Satanists love to have that pentagram on their chest.
[00:36:17.944 --> 00:36:18.864]  I think it gives them power.
[00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.671]  But all it is, is a man inverted.
[00:36:23.031 --> 00:36:24.771]  That's why they call them movie stars.
[00:36:24.831 --> 00:36:25.771]  They're stars.
[00:36:26.491 --> 00:36:27.512]  The head, the arms, the legs.
[00:36:27.552 --> 00:36:29.712]  That's the star, the symbol.
[00:36:30.032 --> 00:36:32.073]  The pentacle is a positive symbol.
[00:36:32.093 --> 00:36:34.313]  That's why we have it on our flag.
[00:36:35.254 --> 00:36:36.194]  Represents we the people.
[00:36:37.234 --> 00:36:38.694]  Those are pictures of humans up there.
[00:36:39.095 --> 00:36:39.495]  Stars.
[00:36:40.175 --> 00:36:40.975]  Made in the image of God.
[00:36:41.015 --> 00:36:44.916]  To travel to the stars, of the stars, from the stars, with the stars, in the blue of space.
[00:36:46.926 --> 00:36:53.491]  And the blood that flows through our veins, and the purity of God that holds our blood up.
[00:36:55.493 --> 00:36:57.114]  That's a holy symbol.
[00:36:57.134 --> 00:36:59.896]  That's why it's beautiful, that's why it's strong.
[00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:03.459]  The stars in the sky.
[00:37:05.361 --> 00:37:16.290]  But the devil worshipers go, oh, you're a star because you come to Hollywood, and you bow down to us, and we turn it upside down, because it's so much fun to be upside down, driving man into the ground.
[00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:23.445]  Destroying yourself, destroying your destiny, throwing it away, and throwing away other people's destinies.
[00:37:23.465 --> 00:37:24.706]  That's the most important part.
[00:37:27.627 --> 00:37:33.129]  And you look at these rebelling sacks of ugly garbage that do this.
[00:37:33.189 --> 00:37:35.590]  They have absolutely nothing.
[00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.592]  And they slither around like they're doing important work.
[00:37:41.012 --> 00:37:44.053]  And then they deceive people and go, oh, we don't really believe in Satan.
[00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:45.794]  We're just
[00:37:47.779 --> 00:37:54.080]  Trying to mess with Christians, but we think the Democratic Party and liberals ought to be Satanists.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.161]  And that should be the new religion.
[00:37:56.881 --> 00:37:57.781]  Well, it ain't new.
[00:38:01.962 --> 00:38:04.762]  A religion of selfishness and destruction and death.
[00:38:05.002 --> 00:38:05.983]  The left-hand path.
[00:38:07.643 --> 00:38:08.403]  With your children.
[00:38:11.604 --> 00:38:17.265]  And all of these fools coming out and making fun
[00:38:20.057 --> 00:38:20.697]  of the Christians.
[00:38:22.839 --> 00:38:26.061]  The real Satanists look like Bill Gates.
[00:38:27.101 --> 00:38:37.068]  They don't look like the scary guy with the lazy eye and the scar, you know, or the guy that's got the club foot and he's mad at God because he's got it, or the Harvey Weinstein that's mad because he's got a vagina.
[00:38:38.388 --> 00:38:39.329]  They're just mad at life.
[00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:41.510]  This guy's a Satanist.
[00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.571]  He wants to kill you.
[00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:48.350]  And he wants to do it and gloat over you and laugh about it while he does it.
[00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.311]  Because he metaphysically has to get up there and say, life's never coming back.
[00:38:52.611 --> 00:38:53.792]  You're going to be depressed forever.
[00:38:54.172 --> 00:38:54.712]  It's over.
[00:38:54.792 --> 00:38:55.552]  Don't have kids.
[00:38:55.972 --> 00:38:59.393]  Oh, the first world might, you know, be able to go out in a year and a half or so.
[00:38:59.433 --> 00:39:01.494]  But for the third world, he's telling you.
[00:39:02.864 --> 00:39:07.626]  He was on Chinese TV and Australian TV and a bunch of others, Japanese TV.
[00:39:08.187 --> 00:39:09.467]  Over there he had a different script.
[00:39:09.907 --> 00:39:10.628]  He was point-blank.
[00:39:10.668 --> 00:39:13.609]  He said, there's people you say are depopulating everybody.
[00:39:13.629 --> 00:39:20.653]  And he told them on all three channels, we're making a film about him, he said, there's different vaccines for different places.
[00:39:21.713 --> 00:39:22.774]  And the presenter goes, hmm.
[00:39:24.073 --> 00:39:27.334]  Because we project on America, we're racist and we're bad.
[00:39:27.414 --> 00:39:31.476]  No, no, we're the Christian place that tried to be Christian, that tried to value everybody.
[00:39:31.956 --> 00:39:33.377]  The antithesis of this Satanism.
[00:39:33.877 --> 00:39:40.400]  You think in China and Japan and places, that they don't think they're the elites and they don't hate each other?
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.700]  And they don't hate foreigners and outsiders?
[00:39:44.001 --> 00:39:46.162]  The Japanese only respect us because we kicked their ass.
[00:39:46.742 --> 00:39:48.343]  And as soon as we did, they went, oh, you're the master.
[00:39:49.243 --> 00:39:51.344]  I'm not putting the Japanese down, I'm telling you the psychology.
[00:39:52.571 --> 00:39:56.214]  Bill Gates gets up there and says, hey, don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.
[00:39:56.654 --> 00:39:58.636]  And the presenters are, oh, thank you, good.
[00:40:00.017 --> 00:40:04.561]  He goes, his answer, are you depopulating?
[00:40:04.621 --> 00:40:06.663]  Well, there are different vaccines for different people.
[00:40:08.424 --> 00:40:12.808]  And he says, oh, the third world's never getting out of lockdown, because they're going to starve everybody to death.
[00:40:13.468 --> 00:40:16.611]  And you know, people go, well, Jones, you're against the hordes pouring over and all this.
[00:40:16.771 --> 00:40:20.134]  The UN also keeps them poor, dumbed down, and then uses them as a weapon.
[00:40:20.454 --> 00:40:29.681]  I'm not for 600 million people from Africa and all over being brought here deliberately to not have any future jobs, dropped in the middle of everywhere to destroy us.
[00:40:31.183 --> 00:40:33.945]  The globalists use them as a weapon while they're busy killing them.
[00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:36.387]  That's what you do to your enemies.
[00:40:36.427 --> 00:40:37.368]  You throw them at each other.
[00:40:40.049 --> 00:40:42.790]  And we sit here and we look at this and we watch this.
[00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:47.333]  Do you really think when they're done killing all those people in the third world, they're not going to kill you?
[00:40:47.353 --> 00:40:48.573]  Do you really think that?
[00:40:48.753 --> 00:41:03.941]  I mean, even if you want to kill the black people, and I don't, even if they dumb them down and turn them against me and then all this other crap they've done to everybody, you think you're actually going to kill all these people and that you're not going to get killed yourself or that God isn't going to tear you apart?
[00:41:07.523 --> 00:41:16.550]  And so, yeah, and so they get the Africans to come over here and, you know, burn American flags, all this super crap, and they put that on the news to make you hate them so you'll go along with killing them.
[00:41:18.091 --> 00:41:22.574]  Bill Gates is on TV, and he says, you know, the economy's never opening again.
[00:41:22.714 --> 00:41:25.336]  Yeah, a lot of people are going to get sick from the vaccine.
[00:41:28.738 --> 00:41:31.781]  See, he's not in the mode anymore of telling you lies.
[00:41:31.861 --> 00:41:32.781]  He's out in the open.
[00:41:33.282 --> 00:41:36.184]  He says, this is the way it is, and we're going to do it.
[00:41:39.574 --> 00:41:43.515]  And then all these fools are going to go out and get these vaccines going wink, wink.
[00:41:43.535 --> 00:41:48.177]  Because I mean, the average Democrat, mid-level, knows Planned Parenthood is meant to kill blacks.
[00:41:48.577 --> 00:41:50.478]  And they'll say, hey man, they're shooting these poor people.
[00:41:50.718 --> 00:41:52.138]  You going to take care of all these black people?
[00:41:52.158 --> 00:41:54.399]  And I'm like, well I sure as hell ain't going to kill them!
[00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:57.200]  I mean, let's get down to brass tacks here, man!
[00:41:59.104 --> 00:42:01.507]  There's a bunch of poor white people too that don't know what they're doing.
[00:42:01.627 --> 00:42:02.348]  Would you kill them?
[00:42:02.508 --> 00:42:03.549]  Let's just kill everybody!
[00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.613]  And then I gotta sit there and watch the front people they've got.
[00:42:06.893 --> 00:42:17.746]  A bunch of weird Islamic women and fat black lesbians running every group on purpose to make us hate them!
[00:42:19.557 --> 00:42:33.343]  Ugly, surly, fat, black lesbians force-fed everywhere so that we hate black people and so we hate black women that have had their men taken away and their culture destroyed and we're being fed in right now at the same time.
[00:42:36.284 --> 00:42:48.690]  They elect horrible, nasty, evil, satanic women and put one from an Islamic country we saved up with a bunch of commies over here all up there with all those contradictions
[00:42:50.896 --> 00:42:53.057]  Where they kill those women in their country for being lesbians.
[00:42:54.017 --> 00:43:04.720]  Spewing how much they hate America, not saying a damn word about the NBA, not a damn word about China, a damn word about 3 million Muslims that aren't bad Muslims getting their asses tortured to death in China.
[00:43:04.921 --> 00:43:11.663]  It's all cutesy funny to these people because they put evil leaders in place on purpose.
[00:43:12.648 --> 00:43:23.235]  To make people resonate with that, because people are followers and believe that that spirit's leadership, and it's because we aren't challenging them in the third dimension at all their events and everywhere else, but the truth, they've taken control!
[00:43:24.256 --> 00:43:27.077]  Well, I refuse to sit here and not lead the assault!
[00:43:27.498 --> 00:43:29.079]  I don't want to be your leader!
[00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:31.200]  I want you to be a leader now!
[00:43:31.701 --> 00:43:32.721]  We don't have time!
[00:43:33.282 --> 00:43:36.324]  It's time to start leading from the front with action!
[00:43:36.344 --> 00:43:38.625]  We'll be right back with hour number two!
[00:43:38.725 --> 00:43:39.185]  Stay with us!
[00:43:40.626 --> 00:43:41.167]  Alright, this...
[00:43:42.478 --> 00:43:44.661]  Videos are making rounds on YouTube.
[00:43:44.921 --> 00:43:45.742]  It's just one of many.
[00:43:47.284 --> 00:43:51.909]  Where I lay out how they're going to get control and have the global lockdown.
[00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:58.116]  And how they're going to get us to accept, through coercion, the inoculations, but legally won't make you do it.
[00:43:59.137 --> 00:44:00.619]  Because metaphysically, that breaks a rule.
[00:44:03.527 --> 00:44:07.609]  That's why they want to have children have the age of consent for medical stuff, sex, you name it, like six.
[00:44:08.189 --> 00:44:12.310]  They also want us to have laws because God looks at laws that we pass.
[00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:16.192]  And when we pass evil laws, we get really judged when it's official.
[00:44:16.792 --> 00:44:19.793]  They like to put the Satanism in writing and burn it into granite.
[00:44:22.434 --> 00:44:24.475]  And then I just got some good Millie Weaver news.
[00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:31.078]  I didn't want to get into it until I learned what was happening with her court case in Ohio, outside of Akron.
[00:44:32.182 --> 00:44:34.164]  So I've got some good news that I'll tell you about coming up.
[00:44:35.265 --> 00:44:36.106]  Start of the next segment.
[00:44:36.126 --> 00:44:38.608]  You know, I've really tried to give you guys accurate information.
[00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:48.097]  And the reason I was flummoxed when this happened is I, it was like being hit by a truck.
[00:44:48.137 --> 00:44:48.878]  You didn't know it was coming.
[00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:51.280]  I was just, it was bizarre.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.061]  Couldn't figure it out.
[00:44:52.461 --> 00:44:54.303]  And I figured out what's going on now.
[00:44:55.124 --> 00:44:55.224]  And.
[00:44:59.110 --> 00:44:59.690]  Gives me a headache.
[00:45:00.711 --> 00:45:05.993]  But it's just a crazy climate that's going on in this country and how crazy things have gotten.
[00:45:06.173 --> 00:45:11.496]  But they were arrested for something that was petty and her mother said wasn't a big deal.
[00:45:11.516 --> 00:45:15.318]  A scuffle and a phone getting broken three months ago, four months ago.
[00:45:17.677 --> 00:45:26.463]  And then because she's a reporter that does work for us, they did go pretty much arrest her and throw the book at her to have that headline, InfoWars contributor.
[00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:29.565]  But in a way, God works to make the film get bigger.
[00:45:29.585 --> 00:45:32.667]  The Lord works through mysterious ways and the weapon for me against which I'll prosper.
[00:45:32.687 --> 00:45:34.168]  But I'll give you details of that coming up.
[00:45:34.429 --> 00:45:35.369]  Here's part of this report.
[00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:39.612]  Alex Jones warns us about COVID-19 years ahead.
[00:45:39.652 --> 00:45:39.972]  Here it is.
[00:45:41.373 --> 00:45:45.956]  Well, I've always said about the Ebola outbreak that I believe the first big plagues of the 21st century
[00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:51.112]  Cell phone brain tumors, that'll be covered up.
[00:45:51.612 --> 00:45:53.873]  All the neurological disorders from vaccines, that'll be covered up.
[00:45:54.233 --> 00:45:59.775]  As a practice of how they manage covering things up as it actually reduces the population.
[00:45:59.795 --> 00:46:03.316]  But then they'll have big events with Ebola or mousepox, I've predicted.
[00:46:03.336 --> 00:46:04.736]  And now we're seeing Ebola.
[00:46:05.016 --> 00:46:07.457]  That'll wipe out hundreds of thousands, then millions.
[00:46:07.857 --> 00:46:12.759]  Then they'll put in a medical tyranny with forced inoculations around stopping that.
[00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:13.879]  I don't know.
[00:46:30.538 --> 00:46:40.645]  It's something they've already tested, they've already mutated, they already know the chain of mutations it's going to go through, so that it will have a computer-modeled effect, so they can be ready.
[00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:43.267]  And again, the average person involved will know nothing.
[00:46:43.687 --> 00:46:55.235]  It'll be modeled and managed to test some sub-plagues that only kill 5 million, 10 million, 20 million, ahead of a mega-weapon that'll then later be released that'll kill 90% of the population.
[00:46:56.576 --> 00:47:01.340]  And that's what The Globalist and all their publications say is 90% what they're going to whack.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.484]  When you get deeper into their documents, they go, well, really humans are a disease.
[00:47:06.985 --> 00:47:10.748]  Only a few elite will be allowed to live and will merge with machines and be God.
[00:47:11.449 --> 00:47:12.790]  And you can't have too many gods.
[00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:21.757]  So in a lot of their documents, if you read deeper, they even talk about there being one being that comes out of the survival of the fittest social Darwin mega race.
[00:47:22.938 --> 00:47:24.820]  And so there can be only one God.
[00:47:26.374 --> 00:47:27.475]  It kind of comes down to that.
[00:47:28.155 --> 00:47:29.776]  And that's the point we've now reached.
[00:47:29.816 --> 00:47:35.438]  Now, whether this is all real or theoretical, the point is the elite are open about their religion.
[00:47:36.219 --> 00:47:37.699]  This is their holy grail.
[00:47:37.999 --> 00:47:39.220]  This is their brass ring.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.101]  This is their goal.
[00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:42.421]  This is their promised land.
[00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:44.642]  This is what they want to do.
[00:47:45.543 --> 00:47:50.685]  And so anyone that ignores this does so at insane levels of peril.
[00:47:51.786 --> 00:47:54.367]  Because once you know their master plan, then everything makes sense.
[00:47:55.776 --> 00:47:59.838]  And no matter how bad the tragedies are, how many they kill, we're just unconscious animals.
[00:48:00.138 --> 00:48:01.658]  We're just a plague hurting the Earth.
[00:48:01.978 --> 00:48:03.979]  They're the guardians of the galaxy.
[00:48:04.219 --> 00:48:05.520]  They're the guardians of the Earth.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.701]  And they know best in the end.
[00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:10.102]  And they are going to attain this godhood.
[00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:13.203]  They are going to achieve Elysium.
[00:48:14.103 --> 00:48:17.165]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:48:17.305 --> 00:48:18.965]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:48:20.386 --> 00:48:22.126]  Alright, let me tell you what's coming up in this hour.
[00:48:22.167 --> 00:48:22.947]  I'm gonna cover the news.
[00:48:24.721 --> 00:48:40.673]  There are videos coming out, so many of them, they're on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, but when I go to Paul Joseph Watson's Twitter, or I go to Mike Cernovich's Twitter, or I go to Andy Ngo's Twitter, or any of those, I mean, you can watch it for hours.
[00:48:42.174 --> 00:48:46.957]  White people being drug out of their vehicles and beaten up, shot, and killed.
[00:48:48.798 --> 00:48:52.161]  Mainly by white people showing off in front of black people.
[00:48:54.775 --> 00:48:57.718]  And I'm not defending black people doing this, I'm just, it's crazy.
[00:48:59.359 --> 00:49:09.609]  And, literally trying to jump in front of people's trucks, and they beat up the guy's wife, and then they act like they're helping her.
[00:49:13.813 --> 00:49:16.316]  I mean, I laugh, not because it's funny, I laugh because,
[00:49:20.495 --> 00:49:24.597]  I don't want the trouble if I come up to some checkpoint and they start beating my vehicle and trying to pull me out of it.
[00:49:24.957 --> 00:49:27.498]  But I mean, if you've got a weapon and you're doing that, I'm going to defend myself.
[00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:32.420]  And these evil people have no chivalry, no decency.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:40.924]  Now look, that's a man attacking a middle-aged woman who's crying and begging for help from behind.
[00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:43.945]  Begging, trying to get in the car with her husband.
[00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:49.288]  He runs in fear and the media is calling this the new Charlottesville.
[00:49:52.984 --> 00:49:59.809]  And I said they corralled those cars in there to cause Charlottesville and probably made that guy run over that poor lady that died, and they sued me for that.
[00:49:59.829 --> 00:50:03.632]  Because I said Soros was funding the whole thing, trying to create a clash.
[00:50:04.893 --> 00:50:11.378]  The University of Georgetown, THE Vatican, is trying to put us out of business.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.281]  And I only say that so you realize the level we're at.
[00:50:16.562 --> 00:50:19.765]  You know, Roger Stone could have snapped his fingers and been paid any amount of money
[00:50:21.343 --> 00:50:23.864]  To make up stuff about President Trump, but he was honorable and didn't.
[00:50:26.344 --> 00:50:29.445]  And then you never see the enemy stop trying to get Roger.
[00:50:29.745 --> 00:50:34.686]  They are so angry at him for getting Trump to run, advising Trump, getting me on board with Trump.
[00:50:39.427 --> 00:50:42.028]  Boy, Roger Stone is really a Christian now.
[00:50:42.788 --> 00:50:43.708]  He was brought up a Christian.
[00:50:47.366 --> 00:50:47.586]  What is it?
[00:50:47.606 --> 00:50:53.208]  I think it's like Eastern European and Sicilian parents, but is that from Hungary or something?
[00:50:53.529 --> 00:51:01.592]  The point is, is that... Roger calls me up now and starts praying with me on the phone.
[00:51:02.372 --> 00:51:04.873]  And he's not a fake guy when it comes to calling people up at home.
[00:51:04.893 --> 00:51:05.273]  That's good.
[00:51:05.293 --> 00:51:07.474]  He's got... Holy Ghost Fire now.
[00:51:07.534 --> 00:51:08.355]  They're really pissed.
[00:51:11.856 --> 00:51:12.997]  So a lot of stuff's going on.
[00:51:15.117 --> 00:51:16.378]  But I spent the whole first hour on...
[00:51:19.366 --> 00:51:19.826]  Bill Gates.
[00:51:22.228 --> 00:51:26.111]  And reading the latest interviews he's given, it's bad, man.
[00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:26.551]  Wow.
[00:51:27.852 --> 00:51:29.213]  It's exactly what we knew they'd do.
[00:51:29.233 --> 00:51:30.834]  It's mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[00:51:31.715 --> 00:51:33.176]  They're never ending this lockdown, folks.
[00:51:33.616 --> 00:51:41.341]  And it's gonna cause, it already has caused a depression, and it's gonna get so bad, and you're being taught that you're obsolete, that you are non-essential.
[00:51:42.762 --> 00:51:46.665]  And it's their whole plan unfolding exactly as they said they'd do it, and so I know what comes next.
[00:51:48.544 --> 00:51:49.744]  And that's why they want us all fair.
[00:51:50.044 --> 00:51:53.306]  So let me do this, this segment and I'll give you the Millie Weaver update.
[00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:59.067]  Next segment, then I'll get into all the other news.
[00:52:00.588 --> 00:52:03.389]  And the mass exodus away from both the East and West Coast.
[00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:10.671]  But I do need to do this because I didn't do this last hour.
[00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:16.413]  I have three new specials and I've been so busy that I never cut them.
[00:52:18.424 --> 00:52:19.345]  Never cut ads for them.
[00:52:20.105 --> 00:52:31.394]  And, um, I get so fatalistic about how bad things have gotten that I kind of buy into their propaganda and stop even worrying about this place being here in the future when it's more important than ever that we stay here and we be here.
[00:52:31.454 --> 00:52:45.244]  So they came to me a few weeks ago and they said, listen, um, you are doing specials that are too big and you're doing free shipping and all this, and it's bringing in a bunch of money, but not a lot of extra funds to fund things.
[00:52:48.601 --> 00:52:53.603]  And so I just said to the guys, I said, well, I've habituated everybody to, you know, want to have these super great deals.
[00:52:53.663 --> 00:52:59.986]  And we don't put enough markup in it that when we do this big a discount, it brings in enough money.
[00:53:00.627 --> 00:53:01.507]  So I'm not bitching.
[00:53:01.547 --> 00:53:02.227]  I'm not complaining.
[00:53:02.768 --> 00:53:05.949]  I'm just saying, these are really important products.
[00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.350]  These are really great products.
[00:53:08.444 --> 00:53:11.608]  The water filtration, the air filtration, the storable food, all of it you need.
[00:53:12.108 --> 00:53:16.794]  The books, the DVDs, the films, all the gear on the site is really first rate.
[00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:18.776]  We put bumper stickers on all the orders.
[00:53:18.876 --> 00:53:25.504]  And so all I'm saying is, you know, don't give your money to Jeff Bezos and do your shopping there.
[00:53:26.485 --> 00:53:27.046]  Do it with us!
[00:53:28.493 --> 00:53:28.753]  I think so.
[00:53:49.045 --> 00:53:55.648]  You know, people aren't going to pay $100 at the store for super high quality fish oil that they're trying to turn into a drug.
[00:53:55.708 --> 00:53:58.610]  It's so effective for what it does for your body, your heart, your brain, everything else.
[00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:07.314]  Well, we don't put the five times markup or the four times markup like the doctor's office does, you know, that sells the vitamins and minerals.
[00:54:07.714 --> 00:54:12.857]  We do a 200% markup and then everybody wants a discount, then discount it, you know, and make 100%.
[00:54:12.957 --> 00:54:15.098]  But then with free shipping, it's less than that.
[00:54:16.832 --> 00:54:19.293]  And on some of these, it's a bigger deal than that.
[00:54:19.413 --> 00:54:22.455]  So, these are really high-end, high-quality.
[00:54:22.495 --> 00:54:32.260]  I mean, I just thought people want super high-quality, high-end at a price that is what mid-grade vitamins and minerals are, because you do get what you pay for.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:38.724]  I mean, you go take that stuff they sell, multivitamins for $10 at the store that says it's all the vitamins and minerals, and if you read, it's synthetic.
[00:54:39.847 --> 00:54:41.107]  That's how they have studies out going.
[00:54:41.428 --> 00:54:44.209]  Vitamins cause people to have heart attacks and liver failure.
[00:54:44.869 --> 00:54:51.651]  Well, yeah, because they're not vitamins, but they have approval by the FDA and the government to put it out when it's a synthetic vitamin.
[00:54:52.932 --> 00:54:53.372]  That's crazy.
[00:54:56.213 --> 00:54:57.473]  Our vitamins are not synthetic.
[00:54:59.094 --> 00:55:03.095]  So, 8-pack PowerStack, I thought would be the best seller ever.
[00:55:04.736 --> 00:55:05.116]  It costs
[00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.951]  Well, all said and done, like $30 a box for these.
[00:55:10.631 --> 00:55:11.291]  13 pills a day.
[00:55:11.631 --> 00:55:12.372]  You won't forget it.
[00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:13.752]  It changes people's lives.
[00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:14.432]  It's amazing.
[00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:19.694]  We're not going to reproduce this when it sells out in just the next month or so.
[00:55:20.054 --> 00:55:20.434]  Two months.
[00:55:21.114 --> 00:55:23.375]  Because it's so expensive and it's such an investment.
[00:55:23.815 --> 00:55:26.816]  And I had to totally discount it, almost to cost, to move it.
[00:55:27.036 --> 00:55:28.017]  Now everybody's buying it.
[00:55:28.457 --> 00:55:29.377]  But I just can't.
[00:55:29.637 --> 00:55:30.938]  Okay, it's gone.
[00:55:33.799 --> 00:55:34.879]  Eight-pack PowerStack.
[00:55:36.164 --> 00:55:38.166]  And Survival Shield X2 Combo.
[00:55:38.347 --> 00:55:39.548]  X2 is now back in stock.
[00:55:39.588 --> 00:55:41.050]  The original liquid, not the spray bottle.
[00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:41.791]  It's back in too.
[00:55:41.811 --> 00:55:43.873]  60% off.
[00:55:44.534 --> 00:55:46.096]  Heart and Body Combo.
[00:55:46.216 --> 00:55:49.039]  Extend-a-wise, it's amazing for the heart and cardiovascular.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.122]  And VasoBeat also does the same thing together.
[00:55:52.786 --> 00:55:55.448]  50% off, Extendable Eyes is selling out fast.
[00:55:55.468 --> 00:55:59.171]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, back in stock, 50% off.
[00:55:59.651 --> 00:56:03.174]  Ultimate Fish Oil, back in stock, 33% off.
[00:56:03.854 --> 00:56:04.635]  I said, 50% off.
[00:56:04.655 --> 00:56:06.356]  He goes, we don't make any money, Alex.
[00:56:06.817 --> 00:56:07.757]  You can't do that.
[00:56:08.078 --> 00:56:09.178]  Just tell them and explain it.
[00:56:09.779 --> 00:56:12.641]  Ultimate Fish Oil, back in stock, 33% off.
[00:56:13.562 --> 00:56:16.044]  Survival Shield X2, 50% off the spray bottle.
[00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:17.535]  Prostagard.
[00:56:17.655 --> 00:56:18.075]  Amazing.
[00:56:18.376 --> 00:56:19.017]  Great zinc.
[00:56:19.037 --> 00:56:19.878]  High quality zinc.
[00:56:20.899 --> 00:56:22.541]  Great salt palmetto.
[00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:23.982]  It's not just good for men, it's good for women.
[00:56:24.283 --> 00:56:30.910]  I mean, the government even lets people say salt palmetto is good for prostate health because it's just a fact.
[00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:31.991]  Medical doctors tell you it's good.
[00:56:32.132 --> 00:56:33.733]  What do you think it does for glands in women too?
[00:56:34.334 --> 00:56:36.016]  It's just been documented with men.
[00:56:36.156 --> 00:56:36.597]  You need it.
[00:56:38.949 --> 00:56:40.212]  33% off back in stock.
[00:56:40.312 --> 00:56:43.839]  Krill Oil, 17% off, selling out fast.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.063]  It's even better than the fish oil, I'll tell you.
[00:56:46.123 --> 00:56:47.787]  But it gives you stinky burps.
[00:56:48.308 --> 00:56:50.151]  Because here's the deal, it's not pasteurized.
[00:56:51.492 --> 00:56:54.194]  They take fish, boil them down, render them down, krill.
[00:56:54.354 --> 00:56:55.294]  It's a bunch of crap.
[00:56:55.635 --> 00:56:57.516]  It still has a great effect, but it's all cloudy.
[00:56:57.936 --> 00:56:58.676]  It's not red.
[00:56:59.477 --> 00:57:01.118]  And good krill's red, folks.
[00:57:01.738 --> 00:57:04.760]  And if you take fish oil and it doesn't give you the burps, it's not good.
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:11.184]  You take krill oil, it doesn't give you fish taste, which I don't like, but it... I sleep better, I feel better, I'm always forgetting to take it.
[00:57:11.404 --> 00:57:12.705]  When I take it, my life's so much better.
[00:57:13.225 --> 00:57:14.546]  It's good for adults, it's good for children.
[00:57:15.779 --> 00:57:18.120]  Crill Oil, 17% off, selling out fast.
[00:57:18.621 --> 00:57:23.583]  Alexa Pure Breeze, $149, plus free shipping, lowest price ever.
[00:57:24.784 --> 00:57:34.749]  This is sold for $250, $300, everywhere else, but his business plan and the way it works is a couple times a year he dumps them on us in his business plan with his board or whatever so that they order more.
[00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:35.510]  It's how they do it.
[00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:37.031]  I don't know why we get the best deal, but they just love us.
[00:57:38.052 --> 00:57:40.635]  That is absolutely free shipping.
[00:57:40.736 --> 00:57:40.635]  $1.49.
[00:57:40.756 --> 00:57:42.818]  You cannot get a better ion filter anywhere even near that.
[00:57:42.899 --> 00:57:43.539]  It's ridiculous.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.782]  Plus, free shipping on all of these specials.
[00:57:46.163 --> 00:57:46.924]  Oh, I forgot that part.
[00:57:47.264 --> 00:57:48.546]  At InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:48.566 --> 00:57:49.868]  So we did add that on there.
[00:57:50.188 --> 00:57:50.789]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:51.170]  Stay with us.
[00:57:52.657 --> 00:58:02.044]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide on this August 17th, 2020 Monday transmission, 77 days out from the election.
[00:58:02.064 --> 00:58:08.768]  I intend to open the phones up in the third hour ahead of Gerald Cilente in the fourth hour in the war room with the vaunted Owen Schroyer.
[00:58:09.989 --> 00:58:13.431]  All right, let's get into the Millie Weaver situation.
[00:58:15.093 --> 00:58:17.935]  I don't take advantage of events that take place
[00:58:19.056 --> 00:58:22.358]  For an agenda I have, I just go with what I really believe the truth is.
[00:58:23.318 --> 00:58:32.303]  And I got blindsided on Friday because Millie had said she was ready to come out with a film that Saturday, and I understand films get behind.
[00:58:32.563 --> 00:58:33.023]  That's great.
[00:58:33.464 --> 00:58:34.824]  She's made a lot of documentaries.
[00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:36.265]  I was sure it was going to be interesting.
[00:58:36.285 --> 00:58:38.666]  We've been promoting it air on air, running trailers for it.
[00:58:38.686 --> 00:58:39.247]  I hadn't seen it.
[00:58:40.687 --> 00:58:41.568]  And she said, I need more time.
[00:58:41.608 --> 00:58:42.969]  I said, take weeks if you need it.
[00:58:43.489 --> 00:58:44.609]  I said, it's not my film.
[00:58:44.649 --> 00:58:47.411]  I mean, I fund you guys, but you're freelance.
[00:58:48.769 --> 00:58:56.434]  And I didn't really know everybody in their film, but I had one lady that's in the film on that election fraud in Kentucky that Millie got on.
[00:58:56.755 --> 00:58:59.817]  She seemed, you know, informative and interesting and well-spoken.
[00:59:00.157 --> 00:59:02.479]  And there was clearly fraud in Kentucky, so this is great.
[00:59:02.519 --> 00:59:03.760]  People in this film haven't seen it.
[00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:07.522]  And then, I'm coming into the show.
[00:59:08.843 --> 00:59:09.844]  Well, let's go back.
[00:59:09.944 --> 00:59:16.609]  Millie starts calling me saying, hey, this Patrick Berge guy that's in the film, he's in Austin.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.861]  And I said, OK, well, I'll have him on.
[00:59:19.901 --> 00:59:21.021]  Let me know when the film is ready.
[00:59:21.041 --> 00:59:21.862]  Let me see the film.
[00:59:22.342 --> 00:59:24.183]  Send me some clips of the film.
[00:59:25.043 --> 00:59:26.924]  And then we'll set you up, and he can be in studio.
[00:59:28.725 --> 00:59:31.806]  Well, nothing happens on that Wednesday, Thursday, and then she calls me in the morning.
[00:59:33.067 --> 00:59:33.627]  I'm working out.
[00:59:33.767 --> 00:59:34.287]  I don't answer.
[00:59:35.588 --> 00:59:37.248]  But she's saying, hey, Patrick Murphy's in town.
[00:59:37.268 --> 00:59:37.889]  You ought to get him on.
[00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:44.131]  And I called Daria up, the producer, and I say, hey, you know, see what's going on with this.
[00:59:44.752 --> 00:59:45.632]  Is she ready with the film?
[00:59:45.652 --> 00:59:46.172]  Can I see it?
[00:59:46.192 --> 00:59:46.713]  When's it coming out?
[00:59:46.773 --> 00:59:47.173]  We don't know.
[00:59:48.126 --> 00:59:55.748]  Come in to do the show, a couple hours later, and they come in right before the show and they go, Millie Weaver's been arrested.
[00:59:55.788 --> 00:59:56.588]  We're getting the video.
[00:59:56.628 --> 00:59:57.208]  I go, arrested?
[00:59:57.248 --> 00:59:57.708]  What the hell?
[00:59:58.128 --> 00:59:58.468]  In Ohio?
[00:59:58.648 --> 01:00:00.409]  Yeah, she's been SWAT teamed.
[01:00:00.429 --> 01:00:01.269]  That's what the internet was saying.
[01:00:01.669 --> 01:00:03.350]  So I go in there and say, oh, she's been SWAT teamed.
[01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:04.170]  I hadn't seen the footage yet.
[01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.170]  It wasn't SWAT teamed.
[01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:10.811]  And then it looked fake because the cops are like, oh, Gaben Wentz, your husband, and we want you too.
[01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:12.432]  And no, we're not going to give it to you.
[01:00:12.452 --> 01:00:13.172]  And I'm like, OK.
[01:00:14.599 --> 01:00:17.061]  Then the internet starts saying, I faked this for this film.
[01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:18.322]  I've never seen the film.
[01:00:19.663 --> 01:00:20.644]  I don't make money off the film.
[01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:21.184]  It's free.
[01:00:21.965 --> 01:00:22.906]  Millie does her own thing.
[01:00:22.946 --> 01:00:24.987]  I don't, and I'm not distancing myself from the film.
[01:00:25.367 --> 01:00:26.488]  I don't know what's in it.
[01:00:27.129 --> 01:00:28.810]  I don't, I'm just nice promoting it.
[01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.812]  Trusting my, you know, correspondence.
[01:00:32.213 --> 01:00:34.094]  And boy has Millie done a lot of great work over the years.
[01:00:34.114 --> 01:00:35.395]  She's been doing stuff with us for over eight years.
[01:00:35.976 --> 01:00:41.080]  And so, I'm on air and they go, hey, the guy's at the door here.
[01:00:42.699 --> 01:00:48.847]  So I talk to him and he's looking kind of freaked out talking to me like, he's like, InfoWars, that's where I come from.
[01:00:49.347 --> 01:00:49.828]  That's there.
[01:00:49.848 --> 01:00:51.750]  I'm like, well, who do you think runs it?
[01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:52.171]  Who's in charge?
[01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:53.372]  Well, I think Roger Stone is.
[01:00:53.572 --> 01:00:54.714]  This is off air in here with me.
[01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:59.399]  And I'm like, I'm like, dude, Roger Stone can't figure out how to work his cell phone or Skype.
[01:00:59.439 --> 01:01:00.140]  Are you joking?
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.762]  I mean, he's a smart Politico guy.
[01:01:02.642 --> 01:01:06.384]  He helped Trump get the black vote, but I mean, that's what we did.
[01:01:06.404 --> 01:01:13.068]  Something we really did help deliver was the truth about Trump and decriminalization of marijuana and minimum sentencing and stuff.
[01:01:14.068 --> 01:01:23.613]  And so I think this is people in over their head, is what I think, because he was in here and I'm like, dude, Roger Stone's not involved in your shadow net deal.
[01:01:23.793 --> 01:01:24.053]  Come on.
[01:01:24.874 --> 01:01:25.654]  With General Jones.
[01:01:25.674 --> 01:01:26.855]  There's no proof of that, no evidence.
[01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:27.575]  They just say that.
[01:01:27.875 --> 01:01:28.456]  They just say it.
[01:01:29.612 --> 01:01:30.994]  And I kind of got off on a rabbit trail.
[01:01:31.074 --> 01:01:32.537]  I don't care if they got something wrong in the film.
[01:01:32.577 --> 01:01:33.177]  I've seen it now.
[01:01:33.918 --> 01:01:35.300]  There is government propaganda going on.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.121]  This is part of it.
[01:01:36.222 --> 01:01:36.963]  It's a good report.
[01:01:37.063 --> 01:01:37.764]  I like the film.
[01:01:38.104 --> 01:01:39.146]  It's gotten a lot of publicity.
[01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:42.090]  A couple million views on YouTube before it got taken down, which is wrong.
[01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:43.011]  We have it at...
[01:01:44.645 --> 01:01:45.186]  I don't know.
[01:02:10.538 --> 01:02:10.718]  I don't
[01:02:33.448 --> 01:02:43.933]  They came out there because it's Infowars and they wanted to say, because they're Democrats, Infowars correspondent, domestic violence, burglary and all this stuff, and it's overblown, and it's a fraud.
[01:02:44.453 --> 01:02:50.976]  I don't think it was to stop the film, because it didn't stop the film, and the film was supposed to be out five, six, seven days before.
[01:02:51.636 --> 01:02:55.878]  I mean, if they did that, boy, the deep state did a perfect job to then go hype something up.
[01:02:56.178 --> 01:02:58.499]  That's why people thought I must have hyped something up.
[01:02:59.508 --> 01:03:04.732]  Or that I must have masterminded this, because why would you have the cops right there when they're supposedly just going to release a film?
[01:03:05.413 --> 01:03:14.400]  I don't know when they were going to release the film, but what really got to me was how the guys here in town waiting to come on my show, and then I've never sent the film.
[01:03:15.461 --> 01:03:18.243]  And I'm told, oh, technical problems, we'll get a copy to you, whatever.
[01:03:18.343 --> 01:03:21.506]  I usually watch something before I talk about it, especially if I financed it.
[01:03:22.793 --> 01:03:28.236]  And then to find out Roger's implicated as a kingpin and it with no evidence, that kind of hurts, you know?
[01:03:28.256 --> 01:03:32.318]  See, that's more evidence of how I'm an insider and I'm, you know, I'm bad.
[01:03:33.038 --> 01:03:35.940]  That, you know, Roger Stone secretly, you know, works for Obama or whatever.
[01:03:36.539 --> 01:03:41.603]  So I'm not mad at that guy, I'm not mad at the Tory lady, any of these people.
[01:03:41.863 --> 01:03:45.546]  The internet can go research these folks themselves, figure out what they think about the whole deal.
[01:03:46.506 --> 01:03:52.110]  That's why I'm hands-off with Paul Watson, or Millie Weaver, or Caitlyn Bennett.
[01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:53.171]  You can ask any of these people.
[01:03:53.531 --> 01:03:54.452]  Very little feedback.
[01:03:54.932 --> 01:04:02.278]  As long as they're putting good material out to fight the New World Order, I just support them, and they say InfoWars is our sponsor, and we get great content to fight the New World Order.
[01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:03.979]  I'm the opposite of the Deep State.
[01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:05.939]  Totally hands-off, not hands-on.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.162]  Until a point, I get with people, things get a little too weird, then I just decouple.
[01:04:12.002 --> 01:04:29.771]  But the good news is, and I can tell you this now as I just talked to the folks that are there with her in Ohio, and they are there at the courthouse and the CPS is not taking the kids right now, they're still gonna be investigating them, and they have some good lawyers thanks to listeners out there and your support, and
[01:04:31.226 --> 01:04:34.470]  They are going to be released anytime now, and so that's certainly good news.
[01:04:35.111 --> 01:04:45.523]  But what happens when information warfare is so big and fighting the globalists is so big, high school stuff kind of breaks out with films and filmmakers and people that are in films.
[01:04:45.583 --> 01:04:46.644]  It's like Hollywood drama.
[01:04:47.105 --> 01:04:48.166]  And that's not what we do.
[01:04:48.206 --> 01:04:48.887]  We're not drama.
[01:04:49.187 --> 01:04:51.129]  It's why I don't even sell films anymore.
[01:04:52.205 --> 01:04:54.246]  I just finance a lot of other people's documentaries.
[01:04:54.326 --> 01:05:04.568]  I just support people with cold, hard cash that you send to us buying products, and I just pump it out to as many people as I can, and I try to do as much as I can.
[01:05:04.868 --> 01:05:11.290]  You know, I financed a lot of the big films exposing the child kidnapping rings, and you financed that.
[01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:13.730]  And a lot of people that I've just asked, I don't want credit.
[01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.611]  Like I tell people, I say, you don't need to put me in the credits.
[01:05:17.092 --> 01:05:17.852]  It's not about that.
[01:05:18.933 --> 01:05:29.580]  And I'm not like George Soros, I don't have that much money, but $50,000 here, $100,000 here, $20,000 there, $10,000 here, you know, that really does the trick for people that are living legitimate work.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.783]  But I've noticed, stay completely out of their process, stay completely out of it.
[01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:40.508]  Because people becoming famous and people interfacing and people being leaders is hard.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.143]  And the globalists come in and they try to sabotage, they try to do all this stuff.
[01:05:45.163 --> 01:05:51.748]  You know, it's like, I want to embrace the Q people and believe it's all real and good folks, but they're like, Jones, you're going to get it for the child kidnapping rings.
[01:05:52.128 --> 01:05:53.169]  We pioneered exposing it.
[01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:55.151]  Or, yeah, you ought to support Millie more.
[01:05:55.171 --> 01:05:56.212]  You turned your back on her.
[01:05:56.232 --> 01:05:59.014]  Yeah, bought them an RV, find them $100,000 plus a year.
[01:05:59.054 --> 01:06:00.015]  I'm just a horrible person.
[01:06:00.799 --> 01:06:04.661]  And there's just some guy I've never met in my office in an outfit with a .45 jacket on.
[01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:06.883]  He leaves, that guy's a New World Order.
[01:06:07.023 --> 01:06:07.843]  I'm the good guy.
[01:06:08.344 --> 01:06:09.464]  I'm the good person.
[01:06:09.544 --> 01:06:11.846]  I expose the Roger Stone.
[01:06:13.347 --> 01:06:13.927]  Or it's worse.
[01:06:14.447 --> 01:06:14.748]  I don't know.
[01:06:15.028 --> 01:06:20.171]  So that's the Billy Weaver thing and I don't know how long this relationship is going to continue.
[01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:20.952]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:20.972 --> 01:06:21.352]  Stay with us.
[01:06:23.763 --> 01:06:32.044]  You know, we built Banned.Video about a year and a half ago because we were banned off YouTube, banned off Twitter, banned off Facebook.
[01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:42.446]  And the site's had some hiccups, but it's been working really good for a while, knock on wood, because we had to move it to gigantic, very complex server systems.
[01:06:43.986 --> 01:06:49.247]  Because some days it's getting up to 8 million visitors.
[01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:52.848]  8 million videos clicked on watch.
[01:06:54.454 --> 01:06:56.575]  Most days, it's 2 million.
[01:06:57.435 --> 01:06:57.896]  And that's good!
[01:06:57.916 --> 01:07:02.698]  In fact, those are old numbers.
[01:07:02.738 --> 01:07:04.419]  Most days now, the average is about 4 million.
[01:07:05.359 --> 01:07:08.101]  And so you're spreading the word, and a lot of new people are finding the truth.
[01:07:08.121 --> 01:07:16.064]  That's why Twitter, starting last Friday, began to put a notice saying, this is dangerous hate speech, this is dangerous material, don't click on it.
[01:07:17.905 --> 01:07:22.767]  But I think that actually increases the clicks, because people are like, stop telling me what I can and I can't do.
[01:07:23.328 --> 01:07:23.508]  So,
[01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:31.053]  I didn't put Shadowgate immediately up Friday, because like I said, it was just like, bam, the police are there.
[01:07:31.353 --> 01:07:32.274]  Is it something in the film?
[01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:41.979]  Remember the guy that took the photo on the submarine and just inadvertently shut a little part of the engine room and got put in prison?
[01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:50.083]  So I obviously wanted to watch something before I did a review or before I did it, but it just all happened where it didn't happen and it got rushed out.
[01:07:51.244 --> 01:07:52.846]  And the whole thing just felt weird.
[01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.007]  It felt weird to everybody else.
[01:07:54.027 --> 01:07:54.827]  Like, what's going on here?
[01:07:54.847 --> 01:07:56.188]  Something weird's about all of this.
[01:07:57.389 --> 01:08:02.894]  And again, I think Millie is a good person.
[01:08:04.536 --> 01:08:14.684]  Um, I know she's a good person, but just imagine being a 29 year old mom and you get tens of millions of views a week on YouTube and Twitter and she's beautiful and she's smart.
[01:08:15.285 --> 01:08:18.728]  And then there's all these people that come around and
[01:08:22.003 --> 01:08:24.845]  Over the years, I know what those people have told her.
[01:08:25.085 --> 01:08:27.746]  Everybody goes at our employees and our reporters and tries to run them off.
[01:08:28.047 --> 01:08:29.267]  It's part of the Democrat psyop.
[01:08:29.708 --> 01:08:30.688]  And I learned to just ignore it.
[01:08:30.708 --> 01:08:32.309]  The secret weapon is just totally ignore it.
[01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:33.510]  Be all about business.
[01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:36.652]  And as soon as gossip starts, I just stop talking to people.
[01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:38.233]  That always ends it.
[01:08:38.733 --> 01:08:41.995]  But then something blows up like this, all crazy.
[01:08:44.056 --> 01:08:50.320]  And the main guy in the film, that's this spook we're all supposed to totally trust, says Roger Stone's the kingpin with no evidence.
[01:08:51.516 --> 01:08:53.157]  And then it's a film that we're promoting.
[01:08:53.177 --> 01:08:53.817]  And I said, you know what?
[01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:54.758]  They say that in the film.
[01:08:55.258 --> 01:08:55.818]  It's stupid.
[01:08:55.938 --> 01:08:56.999]  Overall, the film's good though.
[01:08:57.159 --> 01:08:57.659]  I'll promote it.
[01:08:58.019 --> 01:08:59.019]  I'll just go with it.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:05.843]  So go see the film where my partner, as he said, is the bad guy.
[01:09:05.863 --> 01:09:09.784]  And that's hosted on my website, but you can't get anywhere else.
[01:09:10.365 --> 01:09:14.927]  You know, it's the weirdness of being crapped on and then it being rubbed in.
[01:09:15.848 --> 01:09:18.349]  You know, but that's the celebrity culture.
[01:09:18.869 --> 01:09:20.170]  That's how all this stuff works.
[01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:23.091]  And it's just it's it's it's just bizarre.
[01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:28.493]  And I don't defend Roger Stone because I've worked with him and I like him.
[01:09:28.813 --> 01:09:30.914]  I defend him because I defend the truth.
[01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:34.696]  I defend the truth.
[01:09:36.456 --> 01:09:40.098]  You know, Ezlo Levant is very good at raising money.
[01:09:41.718 --> 01:09:44.420]  And he's a reputable good guy that people try to take down and destroy as well.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:45.300]  And
[01:09:46.618 --> 01:09:48.563]  We partnered with him to help Savannah out.
[01:09:48.603 --> 01:09:50.568]  And we said, you need to be the guy to raise the money for Millie.
[01:09:50.949 --> 01:09:52.954]  Because you delivered all the person to a great job.
[01:09:53.214 --> 01:09:53.455]  She raised $155,000.
[01:09:57.372 --> 01:10:05.398]  See, I'm under such attack that I wouldn't even raise that money, because I'm the guy that pays the paychecks, and pays the expenses, and pays the travel expenses.
[01:10:05.498 --> 01:10:06.198]  I'm the bad guy.
[01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:08.780]  I paid for the film where Roger's the bad guy.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.142]  You gotta understand, that means I'm even worse.
[01:10:11.182 --> 01:10:11.542]  You understand?
[01:10:11.842 --> 01:10:16.986]  Ooh, Super Black Op, where I fund the film, you know, that I'm the bad guy and Roger's the bad guy.
[01:10:17.966 --> 01:10:21.529]  But that's just the crazy type of Easter eggs that people put into things.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.041]  And that's just what I've got to understand.
[01:10:24.121 --> 01:10:26.622]  So I apologize for finding the film where I'm the bad guy.
[01:10:27.163 --> 01:10:34.126]  See, I could start going on for hours about this, but there are hundreds of radio stations picking us up that are tuned in to hear news and hear information.
[01:10:35.347 --> 01:10:41.110]  So I guess just the way to talk about this in general is there's a lot of sickness in society.
[01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:49.715]  And it's going to get worse because it's a spirit of evil and a spirit of delusion and a spirit of bearing false witness.
[01:10:51.156 --> 01:10:51.256]  And
[01:10:52.651 --> 01:10:54.092]  I've never tried to be a liar.
[01:10:54.192 --> 01:10:56.413]  I've never tried to hurt people that didn't have it coming.
[01:10:56.813 --> 01:10:58.914]  I've never made stuff up against people to hurt them.
[01:10:58.934 --> 01:11:01.995]  Because instinctively, I don't like lies.
[01:11:02.655 --> 01:11:07.257]  But I tell you, really now today, the truth matters everything to me.
[01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:15.200]  Because I used to go fast and loose sometimes and get all excited and say something that I went too far or that was wrong, but it wasn't a conscious movement.
[01:11:16.641 --> 01:11:22.203]  But now I just, I just value the truth so much that
[01:11:26.869 --> 01:11:32.274]  You know, it's not about us being persecuted behind the scenes if I told you the stuff that's been done to us lately in association with this.
[01:11:34.095 --> 01:11:36.757]  But it's about people really knowing the truth.
[01:11:36.898 --> 01:11:37.378]  You know what I mean?
[01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:39.059]  Like, people really need the truth.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.642]  We don't need to sweep stuff under the rug.
[01:11:42.062 --> 01:11:45.485]  We don't need to do things like that.
[01:11:49.019 --> 01:11:52.760]  But then there's another side of me that doesn't like infighting and things like that because that's the spirit of the world.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.321]  So I go, well, I just better not go there.
[01:11:54.821 --> 01:11:55.981]  So I'm just going to get into the news.
[01:11:56.502 --> 01:11:57.722]  I'm going to cover all that information.
[01:11:57.742 --> 01:12:03.524]  Um, I'm going to get to all this really shocking footage out of Portland of what mob rule looks like.
[01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:14.148]  And the Antifa are wearing security outfits, black uniforms, say security, and they're beating up a woman and they're beating up the man and they're robbing his vehicle.
[01:12:16.175 --> 01:12:20.298]  And they're calling themselves security and talking like they're cops, because that's all this really is.
[01:12:20.358 --> 01:12:29.364]  See, when you get rid of the police in America, you get communist police, and that's what it is, is men beating women up.
[01:12:29.484 --> 01:12:30.205]  It's animal farm.
[01:12:30.225 --> 01:12:36.229]  You know, George Orwell was a communist, until he worked for the communists in the Spanish Civil War.
[01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:40.612]  And he saw that they were as bad as the fascists, or worse,
[01:12:42.244 --> 01:12:46.406]  Because they were being accepted more than fascists, and he watched the stuff they did to people.
[01:12:49.267 --> 01:12:53.668]  They watched the stuff they did to people, and he just came back and said, this is unbelievable.
[01:12:54.148 --> 01:13:00.811]  He said, if you want to know what the future looks like under a Stalinist regime, it's a boot-stomping on a human face forever.
[01:13:02.231 --> 01:13:09.174]  And that's what you just saw of your TV viewer, is they're kicking him in the temple with, if I kick somebody like that, I'd kill him.
[01:13:11.573 --> 01:13:13.455]  And the guy is brain damaged right now.
[01:13:13.535 --> 01:13:14.616]  And they keep beating him.
[01:13:15.176 --> 01:13:17.518]  And then they say, you're a wimp, get up.
[01:13:18.238 --> 01:13:19.800]  He tried to run us over.
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.021]  It's like the woman looting the Louis Vuitton.
[01:13:22.041 --> 01:13:23.823]  She's going, I can't breathe.
[01:13:24.183 --> 01:13:25.444]  It's like a magic thing.
[01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:26.565]  It's OK, I'm stealing.
[01:13:26.785 --> 01:13:28.266]  Because I can't breathe.
[01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:29.888]  He tried to run me over.
[01:13:29.928 --> 01:13:32.190]  They grab his wife, beat her up.
[01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:33.731]  She begs for help.
[01:13:34.051 --> 01:13:36.333]  While they kick him in the head and go, get up, get up.
[01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:37.454]  It's all like delusion.
[01:13:37.654 --> 01:13:41.097]  It's like saying Antifa doesn't exist out of Nadler's mouth.
[01:13:42.441 --> 01:13:43.781]  It's a religion of lies.
[01:13:43.861 --> 01:13:45.482]  It's like, oh, he's not hurt.
[01:13:45.962 --> 01:13:46.782]  We didn't do anything.
[01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:47.822]  Here, get up.
[01:13:48.002 --> 01:13:49.222]  Kick him back in the temple.
[01:13:52.603 --> 01:13:54.503]  And the guy was out driving around at night.
[01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:55.463]  He's a trendy.
[01:13:59.344 --> 01:14:00.504]  You know, he's got his girl.
[01:14:00.564 --> 01:14:01.704]  I bet she's got the job.
[01:14:01.724 --> 01:14:02.624]  I bet he doesn't have one.
[01:14:02.644 --> 01:14:03.425]  Just looking at the guy.
[01:14:03.765 --> 01:14:04.225]  Just guessing.
[01:14:05.165 --> 01:14:06.205]  They're out having a nice night.
[01:14:06.245 --> 01:14:07.145]  He's like, hey, I'm trendy.
[01:14:07.185 --> 01:14:07.485]  I'm with you.
[01:14:07.505 --> 01:14:09.026]  They're like, no, your ass is white.
[01:14:09.526 --> 01:14:10.426]  He goes, you're white.
[01:14:10.886 --> 01:14:11.546]  This is on the tape.
[01:14:12.844 --> 01:14:17.266]  They say it doesn't matter, you're in a vehicle, and a vehicle is an enemy combatant.
[01:14:17.346 --> 01:14:20.867]  We're gonna say you tried to run us over, because we follow the Soros Directive.
[01:14:23.128 --> 01:14:24.448]  Take that, Crackerhead!
[01:14:25.348 --> 01:14:26.749]  You don't have cornrows.
[01:14:27.249 --> 01:14:31.250]  You don't have a fake white afro.
[01:14:32.771 --> 01:14:35.412]  Your head is short hair.
[01:14:35.452 --> 01:14:36.412]  Maybe you don't have a lot of hair.
[01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:37.192]  Boom!
[01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:38.033]  You're white.
[01:14:40.113 --> 01:14:41.554]  We're gonna make our bones on you.
[01:14:44.804 --> 01:14:45.985]  There's no violence from the left.
[01:14:46.005 --> 01:14:46.645]  They're good people.
[01:14:47.966 --> 01:14:49.146]  And all they've got is each other.
[01:14:49.166 --> 01:14:56.790]  I mean, you think this guy's political driving around in Portland at 10 o'clock at night?
[01:14:58.972 --> 01:15:00.072]  And they just kept beating him.
[01:15:00.092 --> 01:15:01.213]  They just kept stomping him.
[01:15:01.233 --> 01:15:04.755]  They just kept attacking him.
[01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:09.097]  And he lets them beat up his wife, his girlfriend.
[01:15:11.638 --> 01:15:12.479]  That's still not enough.
[01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:15.390]  Well, they beat the woman.
[01:15:18.111 --> 01:15:19.611]  And she's like begging him, like, why?
[01:15:20.191 --> 01:15:20.751]  Why, lady?
[01:15:20.771 --> 01:15:21.772]  You got blonde hair!
[01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:24.233]  You're white!
[01:15:25.193 --> 01:15:28.334]  And the white people are going to show that they hate white people.
[01:15:29.294 --> 01:15:30.695]  They're going to show they're heroes.
[01:15:31.195 --> 01:15:33.476]  Here comes my hero.
[01:15:35.165 --> 01:15:47.231]  You know, I don't even want to cover this story because it's not important for all the great radio and TV listeners out there with the big picture of the worldwide COVID lockdown that is the post-human world that they're setting up and just how dire this is.
[01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:50.613]  I don't want to get us all caught up in all the little minutia.
[01:15:53.614 --> 01:15:55.995]  But I just got this article.
[01:15:56.035 --> 01:15:56.696]  I scanned over it.
[01:15:56.736 --> 01:16:00.177]  I'm going to read over it again during the next break and I may comment on it.
[01:16:02.118 --> 01:16:03.119]  Because it's all they've got.
[01:16:04.841 --> 01:16:13.593]  To file, what is it, seven Sandy Hook lawsuits against me, including people's names I never said are suing me.
[01:16:14.214 --> 01:16:17.078]  I mean, state law says in Connecticut and Texas you can't do that.
[01:16:19.793 --> 01:16:27.220]  And then they have this appeals court judge in Austin, Triana Banks, who literally is best friends with the Austin judge.
[01:16:27.981 --> 01:16:33.306]  And the Austin judge said in the first hearing, I think Alex Jones has a First Amendment, but he needs to pay for what he did to these families.
[01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:34.427]  Didn't do anything to them.
[01:16:34.887 --> 01:16:36.789]  The internet questioned the event because of all the hoaxes.
[01:16:36.869 --> 01:16:38.150]  It was never my identity.
[01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:39.231]  I barely talked about it.
[01:16:39.632 --> 01:16:43.796]  They obsess over it and use my name to keep Sandy Hook in the news constantly.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:50.865]  And then they just constantly file stuff at the appeals courts on us and on what we're doing.
[01:16:51.306 --> 01:17:02.377]  And the way it works in Texas is you can appeal before it ever goes to court with the anti-slap, the frivolous stuff, and you can appeal it again before it ever goes there.
[01:17:02.397 --> 01:17:07.803]  And we're appealing all this because the law is very clear, but it hits this local court of appeals and
[01:17:09.514 --> 01:17:11.055]  They're going to fry me no matter what happens.
[01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:13.836]  If they take over the Supreme Court, they'll do it there as well.
[01:17:14.716 --> 01:17:19.338]  So, obviously I'm fighting for my rights, but you see these headlines that go up everywhere constantly.
[01:17:20.699 --> 01:17:25.701]  Alex Jones Infowars continues losing streak on appeals over Sandy Hook lawsuits.
[01:17:28.442 --> 01:17:33.084]  And then you read it, and it has no reflection in reality, and they use some three-year-old, four-year-old photo.
[01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:37.371]  And they do it over and over again because they want to shut us down.
[01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:39.432]  The establishment wants us off the air.
[01:17:39.752 --> 01:17:42.094]  And they know that the public has woken up to the establishment.
[01:17:43.214 --> 01:17:47.797]  And so their argument is, oh, Jones is secretly the establishment.
[01:17:47.837 --> 01:17:48.257]  That's right.
[01:17:48.617 --> 01:17:51.819]  You know, we had a great event this Saturday.
[01:17:52.419 --> 01:17:54.601]  I probably picked a park entrance that was too long to go to.
[01:17:54.661 --> 01:17:55.521]  Some people got overheated.
[01:17:55.841 --> 01:17:57.022]  But we went down and swam in the creek.
[01:17:57.062 --> 01:17:57.522]  It was great.
[01:17:57.642 --> 01:17:58.123]  Great event.
[01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:00.444]  Maybe I'll play a clip of it next hour.
[01:18:00.904 --> 01:18:01.785]  Let's hit Band On Video.
[01:18:03.755 --> 01:18:05.836]  And I shook 200 hands at least.
[01:18:06.917 --> 01:18:09.498]  But I probably had 20 people ask me, you know, are you for real?
[01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:12.279]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.561]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:18:17.682 --> 01:18:18.482]  What are our fruits?
[01:18:19.583 --> 01:18:25.746]  The truth, a track record of steadfastness and supporting justice and standing up for everybody's rights and being honorable.
[01:18:27.587 --> 01:18:27.727]  But
[01:18:29.147 --> 01:18:31.108]  It doesn't hurt my feelings that people ask me that.
[01:18:31.148 --> 01:18:34.789]  It hurts my feelings that we don't have time to play games with this.
[01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:37.069]  You don't need to know if I'm for real.
[01:18:37.109 --> 01:18:38.070]  Of course I'm for real.
[01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:40.110]  Worse than all, I'm a good person.
[01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:40.651]  I love God.
[01:18:40.931 --> 01:18:41.331]  I love you.
[01:18:41.391 --> 01:18:41.951]  I love justice.
[01:18:41.971 --> 01:18:42.731]  But I'm not perfect.
[01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:45.092]  But I'm not consciously trying to do bad things.
[01:18:48.413 --> 01:18:50.113]  I mean, I like women.
[01:18:50.233 --> 01:18:51.474]  There's nothing wrong about that.
[01:18:52.334 --> 01:18:52.914]  I like food.
[01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:55.755]  I'm a lustful person.
[01:18:56.035 --> 01:18:56.575]  That's about it.
[01:18:56.595 --> 01:18:58.156]  About the extent of the bad stuff.
[01:18:59.531 --> 01:19:00.912]  He's got plenty of courage, plenty of will.
[01:19:01.852 --> 01:19:04.493]  But the thing is, it's not about me.
[01:19:06.194 --> 01:19:08.195]  The globalists are coming against us.
[01:19:08.315 --> 01:19:09.596]  World government is here.
[01:19:09.696 --> 01:19:10.436]  It's out in the open.
[01:19:10.816 --> 01:19:12.777]  Anybody can go read Event 201.
[01:19:13.978 --> 01:19:16.739]  Anybody can go read Bill Gates saying the lockdown never ends.
[01:19:17.279 --> 01:19:28.064]  Anybody, anybody can go read Operation Lockstep by the Rockefeller Foundation about setting up a planetary prison, a global police state,
[01:19:29.039 --> 01:19:35.441]  I mean, and the end of humanity as we know it, and the shutdown of the industrialized world to make populations collapse.
[01:19:38.142 --> 01:19:39.402]  Do you know what that means?
[01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:53.047]  I mean, I'm sitting here telling you this is going on, you can verify it, and then all the globalists do is change the subject to infighting, just like the race rioting and the divide and conquer.
[01:19:53.067 --> 01:19:56.848]  That's all empires do, is divide and conquer people.
[01:19:59.022 --> 01:19:59.842]  That's all they've got.
[01:19:59.862 --> 01:20:19.008]  And then I watch, classically, that done to us over and over again by people we think are our friends, people that we've supported and financed and done everything for and done nothing but been loving and good, and then to have a knife stuck in your back over and over again, it just makes you sad for people.
[01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:20.513]  I'm not a victim.
[01:20:20.613 --> 01:20:21.593]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[01:20:22.014 --> 01:20:30.596]  I wonder how are we turning out so many twisted, screwed up people that don't know honor or justice or freedom and all they know is betrayal and lies.
[01:20:33.497 --> 01:20:40.339]  The left ignoring all the real pedophilia and then making up the Me Too movement and having women go out and lie and say all these men did stuff to them.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:48.541]  And then these evil Congresswomen, Maxine Waters and others running around saying we need
[01:20:49.824 --> 01:20:53.207]  To have all this violence, we need to go out and have civil unrest.
[01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.410]  Let's play that clip.
[01:20:57.111 --> 01:21:03.158]  Representative Presley, Anya Presley, always saying horrible stuff, had this to say.
[01:21:04.517 --> 01:21:05.517]  I'm looking to the public.
[01:21:06.097 --> 01:21:27.624]  You know, this is as much about public outcry and organizing and mobilizing and applying pressure so that this GOP-led Senate and that these governors that continue to carry water for this administration, putting the American people in harm's way, turning a deaf ear to the needs of our families and our communities, hold them accountable.
[01:21:29.261 --> 01:21:32.003]  Well, make the phone call, send the email, show up.
[01:21:32.524 --> 01:21:36.167]  You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives.
[01:21:36.467 --> 01:21:38.168]  And unfortunately, there's plenty to go around.
[01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:48.217]  And the arrogance and the way they get certain leftist black people, leftist women, and they put them up there.
[01:21:49.335 --> 01:21:51.877]  And then they're all under attack and America's bad.
[01:21:51.917 --> 01:21:55.299]  Never worried about communist China, the death camps for Muslims, for Christians.
[01:21:55.419 --> 01:21:56.260]  No, no, it's all fake.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:00.643]  Because they know America's weak and will roll over to them and go, I'm sorry, I want to be bad.
[01:22:00.703 --> 01:22:02.804]  I want to prove to you I'm good, please.
[01:22:03.525 --> 01:22:10.670]  And then every day, knockout games, white people being shot, stabbed, murdered, run over, pulled out of their cars, beat up.
[01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:13.692]  That little five-year-old kid got shot in the head.
[01:22:14.744 --> 01:22:19.985]  The media put out that his dad did drugs with the other guy, just made it up, and Twitter pushed it to the top.
[01:22:20.766 --> 01:22:22.166]  Even though it was a fake police report.
[01:22:23.286 --> 01:22:24.927]  Because they had to dehumanize that little white boy.
[01:22:26.507 --> 01:22:27.588]  To get more killing going.
[01:22:28.828 --> 01:22:36.570]  Because if black folks saw that white kid getting killed, maybe they'd say, hey, there's just bad people in the world, let's not blame black people, let's not blame white people, let's blame the individual.
[01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:42.792]  But they don't do that, because this woman, she gets up there and she says, hey, we need more unrest.
[01:22:42.812 --> 01:22:43.832]  Well, you're getting the unrest.
[01:22:44.833 --> 01:22:50.464]  And if somebody's white, well, their wife gets drug out of the car, and then they run away, and then they get drug out.
[01:22:53.171 --> 01:22:55.332]  Trying to drive around the crowds, trying to kill them.
[01:22:55.573 --> 01:22:58.094]  They're chasing the guy down the street, pulling their bikes in front of him.
[01:22:58.114 --> 01:23:02.577]  He runs in to a telephone pole, trying to drive down the sidewalk to get away, because they're out on the road.
[01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:04.178]  And they're screaming, don't run me over.
[01:23:04.198 --> 01:23:08.821]  It's like the video last week, where they're aiming guns in Indiana at the guy on the road, blocking him.
[01:23:09.102 --> 01:23:10.683]  He tries to drive around through a parking lot.
[01:23:10.703 --> 01:23:12.484]  They run, going, don't run me over!
[01:23:12.744 --> 01:23:17.367]  He's like 100 miles, running as fast as they can to get in front and be victims, and jump on the vehicle.
[01:23:18.548 --> 01:23:19.589]  I'm a victim!
[01:23:19.769 --> 01:23:22.771]  They want to recreate that Charlottesville and be those heroes.
[01:23:25.072 --> 01:23:30.636]  Portland rioters viciously beat man unconscious after he crashes his truck and now they're calling him a proud boy and all this made-up stuff.
[01:23:30.796 --> 01:23:39.061]  Go ahead and roll the tape.
[01:23:39.102 --> 01:23:41.723]  They're beating her up.
[01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:45.105]  They tackle her from the back.
[01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:45.866]  Men attacking women.
[01:23:45.886 --> 01:23:48.268]  She deserves it.
[01:23:48.288 --> 01:23:48.848]  She's white.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:55.822]  And then they go on and say, get up, you're not hurt.
[01:24:19.281 --> 01:24:20.381]  Of course he's really knocked out.
[01:24:20.582 --> 01:24:22.863]  Then they rob his vehicle.
[01:24:23.363 --> 01:24:26.644]  Now they beat his girlfriend up some more.
[01:24:27.324 --> 01:24:28.605]  The scum of the earth, man.
[01:24:29.205 --> 01:24:32.687]  No souls, no empathy, no connection.
[01:24:34.127 --> 01:24:35.128]  Obese liberals.
[01:24:35.848 --> 01:24:42.311]  Imagine a bunch of black people and white people beating up a white guy.
[01:24:44.321 --> 01:24:46.482]  And now they're calling him a wimp because he's hurt bad.
[01:24:47.022 --> 01:24:49.643]  Importantly, he's brain damaged in the hospital because they stomped his head a bunch.
[01:24:49.903 --> 01:24:51.763]  But there's more footage than this.
[01:24:51.863 --> 01:24:54.384]  I mean, look at the back of his head.
[01:24:54.444 --> 01:24:57.465]  Blood pouring out.
[01:24:57.485 --> 01:24:58.085]  Now they're laughing.
[01:24:58.165 --> 01:24:59.525]  Oh, screw you.
[01:25:00.246 --> 01:25:01.326]  Is this airway clear?
[01:25:02.226 --> 01:25:03.747]  Oh, he's a faker.
[01:25:03.827 --> 01:25:05.767]  He's in a pool of blood.
[01:25:05.807 --> 01:25:07.468]  Blood's coming out of his mouth.
[01:25:11.248 --> 01:25:13.450]  We're so liberal!
[01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:14.912]  We're such good people!
[01:25:20.377 --> 01:25:21.278]  We're so good!
[01:25:22.539 --> 01:25:25.922]  You know, I can't back down because they just get you quicker that way.
[01:25:26.803 --> 01:25:27.944]  No, I'll stand my ground.
[01:25:29.225 --> 01:25:29.826]  I know what's right.
[01:25:32.949 --> 01:25:33.930]  Won't be turned around.
[01:25:38.581 --> 01:25:42.364]  And I'll keep this world from dragging me down.
[01:25:43.965 --> 01:25:45.026]  Here's the most important part.
[01:25:45.866 --> 01:25:46.667]  No, I know what's right.
[01:25:49.749 --> 01:25:50.570]  I got just one life.
[01:25:54.732 --> 01:25:55.773]  There ain't no easy way out.
[01:26:00.697 --> 01:26:02.038]  You're gonna find that out now, folks.
[01:26:02.898 --> 01:26:03.699]  Gotta stand my ground.
[01:26:11.604 --> 01:26:15.065]  It's harder to back down.
[01:26:16.886 --> 01:26:20.407]  Freedom and justice and everything good comes from not backing down.
[01:26:23.668 --> 01:26:24.788]  I got just one life.
[01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:32.070]  Yeah, Tom Petty does a great job with that song, but I think old Johnny Cash does a better job.
[01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:36.171]  No easy way out.
[01:26:36.592 --> 01:26:37.692]  I'll have a podcast called that.
[01:26:40.017 --> 01:26:40.778]  I won't back down.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:44.740]  All right.
[01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:57.609]  You know, John Bowne did a really good report that really should be aired, and there's so many others, but Austin, Texas is now the home invasion capital of the world.
[01:27:00.971 --> 01:27:03.793]  And just five years ago, it had a very low crime rate.
[01:27:04.594 --> 01:27:05.515]  It's dangerous as hell.
[01:27:06.374 --> 01:27:08.115]  And they've had trouble suppressing those numbers.
[01:27:08.895 --> 01:27:11.957]  And now they're cutting the police budget 20 plus percent.
[01:27:13.438 --> 01:27:21.262]  And they're going to have the police, though, doing all this new social stuff, messing with everybody that isn't a criminal.
[01:27:22.762 --> 01:27:24.463]  I mean, I tell you, man, it's so screwed up.
[01:27:25.864 --> 01:27:29.226]  And if you think the police got problems now, and they do because everybody's got problems,
[01:27:31.648 --> 01:27:34.591]  You just imagine until they're SJW'd out like the UK, man.
[01:27:34.631 --> 01:27:39.196]  The footage coming out of the UK, where they walk up to Nigel Farage, who could have been the Prime Minister.
[01:27:39.616 --> 01:27:42.218]  Most popular man in the UK, probably in Europe.
[01:27:42.739 --> 01:27:43.780]  A rock star of liberty.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:49.806]  And they come up to him and they say, you're not allowed to videotape these boats landing.
[01:27:49.826 --> 01:27:51.207]  We're gonna arrest you if you don't get out of here.
[01:27:51.227 --> 01:27:54.871]  But it's all in a fake leftist British accent.
[01:27:56.018 --> 01:27:57.939]  There's nothing soft about it.
[01:27:58.019 --> 01:27:59.661]  It's hardcore tyranny.
[01:28:00.361 --> 01:28:01.622]  And the Australian police.
[01:28:02.583 --> 01:28:05.225]  Because Aussies are great people, but they've always had bad cops.
[01:28:06.706 --> 01:28:14.611]  Because they were a prison colony, and I mean, you know, if you smarted off in those work camps, whatever, they'd hang your ass.
[01:28:17.393 --> 01:28:17.554]  So...
[01:28:18.956 --> 01:28:25.997]  I mean, they catch a mom out there with her mask on, you're not allowed, they walk right up and just slam her head around the wall and start choking her.
[01:28:26.837 --> 01:28:33.799]  And the woman goes, please don't choke me, and they keep choking, saying she's resisting, because they tell them, you go out there and you brutalize women!
[01:28:34.879 --> 01:28:36.919]  We want the images of women being brutalized!
[01:28:37.139 --> 01:28:42.520]  And then you get all these videos of them choking women, and it's men choking women in front of their kids.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:43.780]  You say, why do they do that?
[01:28:43.961 --> 01:28:46.361]  Because they're teaching your ass that you're a slave!
[01:28:50.896 --> 01:28:53.577]  They're teaching you that they are God.
[01:28:56.059 --> 01:28:59.420]  And if it's a white guy beating up a black guy for not wearing a mask, it's okay.
[01:28:59.741 --> 01:29:02.202]  If it's a white guy choking a woman, it's okay.
[01:29:02.222 --> 01:29:05.003]  Because they're heroes, man!
[01:29:05.204 --> 01:29:06.464]  They're saving you from the COVID!
[01:29:08.205 --> 01:29:09.766]  Bill Gates said it ain't ever coming back.
[01:29:10.326 --> 01:29:11.287]  You ain't ever living again.
[01:29:11.307 --> 01:29:12.247]  You ain't ever having a job.
[01:29:12.267 --> 01:29:12.968]  You're not essential.
[01:29:13.568 --> 01:29:15.769]  You're gonna sit in your house while everything crumbles.
[01:29:16.009 --> 01:29:19.251]  By the time you figure out it's an orchestrated depression, well, that's too late, ain't it?
[01:29:23.183 --> 01:29:27.825]  You had a big steaming bowl of mass collapse and famine and death and war.
[01:29:27.845 --> 01:29:29.806]  Well, that's too long.
[01:29:30.747 --> 01:29:38.090]  You're gonna get what those babies get in their mama when they dump that acid bath in there for a day and a half while their skin burns off.
[01:29:42.312 --> 01:29:46.014]  You're all gonna get hurt real bad now, and I am too.
[01:29:47.955 --> 01:29:50.136]  Welcome to the new leftist city!
[01:29:51.037 --> 01:30:04.844]  Once very low crime rates, seen as the best city to live in, the left moved here and in just a couple years it's now one of the most undesirable feces, needles, and the highest crime rate in the state of Texas, almost the country, for home invasions.
[01:30:05.544 --> 01:30:08.446]  Because in came the left that don't have guns, the predators know.
[01:30:08.466 --> 01:30:12.848]  If you've got a Democrat sticker on your house, rob, rob, rob.
[01:30:14.588 --> 01:30:23.274]  Communist sympathizer and District 4 City Council member Gregorio Cazar has spearheaded the left's inevitable engineered demise of Austin, Texas.
[01:30:23.474 --> 01:30:32.801]  Cazar and the totalitarian mob running the Austin, Texas City Council have signed off on ultimately cutting $150 million from the Austin Police Department.
[01:30:32.861 --> 01:30:33.161]  That's right.
[01:30:56.014 --> 01:31:02.438]  53% to 40% do not support reducing officers, according to the Greater Austin Crime Commission.
[01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:09.342]  The survey also found that 47% of Austin voters believe the city is on the wrong track.
[01:31:09.782 --> 01:31:14.225]  84% of those surveyed were dissatisfied with the handling of the homeless.
[01:31:14.645 --> 01:31:18.828]  92% of Austin voters feel safe in their neighborhoods, but only 56% feel safe downtown.
[01:31:20.529 --> 01:31:27.476]  And there was overwhelming performance satisfaction for the Austin Fire Department and the Austin-Travis County EMS.
[01:31:27.797 --> 01:31:43.313]  But the safety of Austinites is obsolete to Marxist idealism, as $21 million will immediately be reinvested into reimagining of housing programs and victim and mental health services, cutting cadet classes and overtime pay,
[01:31:43.593 --> 01:31:57.376]  As another $80 million will minimize the departments of the forensic labs, communications, victim services, community partnerships, and roughly $50 million will be reimagined and cut down other programs within the department.
[01:31:57.576 --> 01:32:04.858]  But the Austin City Council found another $250,000 to give to their abortion care practical support program.
[01:32:05.118 --> 01:32:12.880]  Police Chief Brian Manley calmly set the table for what Austinites can expect when requiring the aid of law enforcement in the future.
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:24.030]  And as everyone is aware, as a result of the budget that was passed earlier today by the Mayor and City Council, we are going to see some fundamental changes here at the Police Department.
[01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:27.212]  Changes that we've not seen in my 30 years since I've been here.
[01:32:27.793 --> 01:32:32.417]  With the reduction of 150 police officer positions in the Austin Police Department,
[01:32:32.957 --> 01:32:37.182]  We will go back to a staffing level that we were at back in 2015.
[01:32:37.663 --> 01:32:41.948]  So this will require some work with me and my team.
[01:32:42.128 --> 01:32:46.594]  Is there any plan right now to change the security detail for council members?
[01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.335]  There are no plans for that right now.
[01:32:49.696 --> 01:32:54.637]  We have many units that will be under consideration as we figure where we will pull officers from.
[01:32:55.157 --> 01:33:03.960]  Again, we're going to have to move officers out of specialized details to put them into the patrol function so we can maintain adequate resources on patrol.
[01:33:04.381 --> 01:33:14.564]  While Texas Governor Abbott told Newsweek, Austin's decision puts the brave men and women of the Austin Police Department and their families at greater risk and paves the way for lawlessness.
[01:33:14.804 --> 01:33:18.806]  Public safety is job one, and Austin has abandoned that duty.
[01:33:18.906 --> 01:33:25.010]  But in the meantime, the Texas Department of Public Safety will stand in the gap to protect our capital city.
[01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:29.533]  Rapes, burglaries, and theft in Austin is already above the state average.
[01:33:29.793 --> 01:33:31.874]  And home invasions are a constant.
[01:33:32.014 --> 01:33:38.317]  Police say four suspects broke into an apartment and robbed the victim and child at gunpoint.
[01:33:38.577 --> 01:33:51.122]  Overnight, investigators releasing the gut-wrenching 911 call made moments after intruders broke into a Texas home in the middle of the night, killing this young father as he tried to defend his family.
[01:33:51.582 --> 01:33:52.022]  I need help.
[01:33:52.122 --> 01:33:52.943]  I need help so bad.
[01:33:52.983 --> 01:33:56.546]  Deputies say Allen broke into the home and robbed the woman at gunpoint.
[01:33:56.746 --> 01:34:00.629]  At one point, the victim says Allen zip-tied her ankles and wrists together.
[01:34:00.849 --> 01:34:06.313]  He told her not to move for at least five minutes and said, I know where you live and that you have a son.
[01:34:06.653 --> 01:34:13.398]  Lucero-Vazquez and her daughter were fast asleep at around 9 o'clock Wednesday morning at this Northeast Austin apartment complex.
[01:34:13.558 --> 01:34:14.879]  Her husband was at work.
[01:34:15.199 --> 01:34:17.801]  What woke them up was completely unexpected.
[01:34:19.061 --> 01:34:21.662]  It was a man dressed in blue with a cap.
[01:34:22.122 --> 01:34:23.363]  The same from the video.
[01:34:23.543 --> 01:34:32.185]  And that video was caught by this camera up above showing the man who Austin Police say kicked in the door, walked into Vazquez's bedroom and demanded money.
[01:34:32.205 --> 01:34:36.947]  They say three people broke into an apartment as part of a home invasion robbery.
[01:34:37.227 --> 01:34:41.048]  The residents were home at the time and responded by shooting the suspects
[01:34:41.468 --> 01:34:43.249]  Two of the three people were killed.
[01:34:43.289 --> 01:34:45.630]  The third suspect was taken to a local hospital.
[01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:55.173]  The email stated two students saying two men kicked in the door to their apartment, struck them with rifles, stole their belongings and left.
[01:34:55.353 --> 01:35:00.335]  But the Austin City Council literally calls to have APD headquarters blown up.
[01:35:00.736 --> 01:35:09.379]  Instead transforming the international destination of South by Southwest and the Austin City Limits Festival into a crime riddled homeless shelter.
[01:35:09.639 --> 01:35:15.544]  You know, we have a person's belongings right next to our patio.
[01:35:15.704 --> 01:35:16.565]  They've been here for weeks.
[01:35:17.206 --> 01:35:18.407]  We can't say anything about it.
[01:35:19.007 --> 01:35:20.448]  APD can't say anything about it.
[01:35:20.889 --> 01:35:21.750]  It's an obstruction.
[01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:26.153]  So, you know, that's a very gray definition with the ordinance change.
[01:35:26.253 --> 01:35:27.314]  It's not just downtown.
[01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:32.439]  Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works in South Austin, captured this on store surveillance.
[01:35:32.739 --> 01:35:36.821]  He was pretty much just terrorizing the ladies that were leaving businesses, trying to get to their vehicle.
[01:35:37.602 --> 01:35:41.124]  He threatened to, you know, kill someone, kill a lady.
[01:35:41.144 --> 01:35:45.506]  Police took probably about an hour and 30 minutes or so to show up.
[01:35:45.826 --> 01:35:48.268]  Cargill says he also captured this with his cell phone.
[01:35:48.648 --> 01:35:53.691]  Defecating and some other stuff and also shooting up, you know, right by our front door.
[01:35:54.251 --> 01:35:59.314]  Most of the country is currently fleeing in droves to cities just like Austin.
[01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:00.990]  Have you ever seen that?
[01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:03.211]  This is what the media did not show.
[01:36:03.931 --> 01:36:04.732]  Look at everything.
[01:36:04.932 --> 01:36:05.832]  Everything's boarded.
[01:36:05.892 --> 01:36:07.232]  Even the hotel is boarded up.
[01:36:08.253 --> 01:36:10.073]  Look.
[01:36:10.113 --> 01:36:11.274]  This is all Manhattan.
[01:36:11.474 --> 01:36:12.034]  Boarded up.
[01:36:13.034 --> 01:36:20.137]  But before you know it, cities like Austin will represent the hellholes those people are rapidly fleeing from.
[01:36:20.477 --> 01:36:21.797]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:27.239]  And by the way, what's crazy is they did a news report with Cargill.
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:29.080]  He's a good friend of mine.
[01:36:30.333 --> 01:36:31.334]  And he's not even in a bad area.
[01:36:31.434 --> 01:36:35.017]  Austin, they've been robbed, attacked, shot up.
[01:36:35.057 --> 01:36:37.039]  You hear him go, am we at shooting up?
[01:36:37.459 --> 01:36:38.820]  No, they've been shot up, remember?
[01:36:39.721 --> 01:36:42.083]  When they tried to break in to get the guns like a month ago.
[01:36:42.183 --> 01:36:46.147]  I mean, it's like one business has been attacked like five times.
[01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:49.369]  And folks, they're robbing the fancy neighborhoods.
[01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:50.811]  They're robbing it all now.
[01:36:51.752 --> 01:36:57.797]  And the good news is all the liberals I know, that my wife knows, because you know, she used to be a liberal.
[01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:00.623]  I would call her leftist.
[01:37:00.643 --> 01:37:06.153]  They're all buying guns and shotguns and now her liberal friends are like apologizing and saying, you're right.
[01:37:06.574 --> 01:37:07.455]  Oh my God, what do we do?
[01:37:07.816 --> 01:37:08.778]  It's not about being right.
[01:37:08.818 --> 01:37:12.485]  It's just like, let me say something here really, really important.
[01:37:18.757 --> 01:37:38.898]  When the UN signs a treaty with almost every nation on earth in 1992 to by 2020 be in full swing for a post-industrial world that causes an 80% population collapse by 2050, if you look at the numbers and what that would do, it's road warrior, end of the world stuff.
[01:37:40.216 --> 01:37:43.797]  I mean, Revelation says the Antichrist kills, what is it, two-thirds of the Earth?
[01:37:44.177 --> 01:37:44.557]  I forget.
[01:37:44.577 --> 01:37:45.818]  You know, die during all this?
[01:37:46.078 --> 01:37:47.598]  Well, the UN says 80%.
[01:37:49.999 --> 01:37:51.199]  What do you think this is going to be like?
[01:37:51.239 --> 01:37:52.300]  You think this is going to be fun?
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:38:01.962]  You think you're just going to silver surf through the whole deal and it's going to be cakes and lions and teddy bears and unicorns?
[01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:04.023]  No, folks, it ain't going to be Lucky Charms.
[01:38:06.031 --> 01:38:08.952]  And people go, oh, the left is inept.
[01:38:09.472 --> 01:38:12.053]  They collapse everywhere they go and mental illness.
[01:38:12.353 --> 01:38:13.433]  They're not inept!
[01:38:14.473 --> 01:38:15.553]  The front people are.
[01:38:15.593 --> 01:38:23.936]  You think Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Nadler that can't even hardly talk run anything?
[01:38:23.956 --> 01:38:25.676]  They're told what to say.
[01:38:28.557 --> 01:38:30.097]  You think Joe Biden runs anything?
[01:38:31.758 --> 01:38:33.298]  Joe Biden's in there because he'll do what he's told.
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.722]  And he's so stupid, he'll destroy his own future.
[01:38:38.543 --> 01:38:39.965]  His own children's future.
[01:38:43.909 --> 01:38:46.311]  They're engineering this whole thing.
[01:38:47.172 --> 01:38:48.694]  On purpose, and they admit they are.
[01:38:49.074 --> 01:38:51.277]  It's not like I'm just saying, oh, it's obviously engineered.
[01:38:51.577 --> 01:38:54.120]  They say they're collapsing everything.
[01:38:57.108 --> 01:38:57.508]  The U.N.
[01:38:57.548 --> 01:39:01.509]  admits 130-something million are going to starve to death under a year of COVID lockdown.
[01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:03.290]  We're already eight months in, and guess what?
[01:39:03.330 --> 01:39:04.290]  Millions are starving to death.
[01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:07.351]  They just die in their sleep, folks, and they just say, oh, malnutrition.
[01:39:09.972 --> 01:39:14.954]  And then you'll be walking down the street, and there's some arrogant black person going, you white people need to do something for us.
[01:39:15.394 --> 01:39:17.335]  Oh, you need to do something for everybody.
[01:39:17.375 --> 01:39:18.175]  It's disgusting.
[01:39:19.195 --> 01:39:22.738]  Like all these bloated, weird, Black Lives Matter women that run everything.
[01:39:23.198 --> 01:39:25.420]  They don't say a word about death camps in China.
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:27.141]  They don't give a flying you-know-what.
[01:39:27.341 --> 01:39:29.703]  They're all a bunch of devil worship and trash.
[01:39:30.283 --> 01:39:32.265]  And it's all gonna go down now, folks.
[01:39:33.786 --> 01:39:35.247]  You know, I don't care about Hollywood.
[01:39:35.327 --> 01:39:36.628]  I don't care about status.
[01:39:36.768 --> 01:39:38.269]  I don't care about the world's power.
[01:39:39.650 --> 01:39:41.672]  But I do care about human life and our souls.
[01:39:43.473 --> 01:39:45.535]  And I know the most effective thing I do
[01:39:47.591 --> 01:39:51.194]  He's calling different globalists out by name and putting messages directly out to them.
[01:39:51.214 --> 01:40:00.461]  And at a subconscious level, I hold back because that's the one time you can really piss them off and they go ahead and have you killed.
[01:40:01.402 --> 01:40:02.643]  And it's not that I'm afraid of dying.
[01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:04.544]  I just don't want to do suicidal things.
[01:40:05.645 --> 01:40:06.746]  Suicide by globalist.
[01:40:06.806 --> 01:40:08.788]  And so literally the Holy Spirit holds me back from it.
[01:40:09.308 --> 01:40:12.811]  But now the Holy Spirit has told me to go ahead and attack.
[01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:16.471]  And here's the issue after years of holding back.
[01:40:16.712 --> 01:40:21.695]  I've been holding back, ladies and gentlemen, the real oratory skills and the real analysis and the will.
[01:40:22.935 --> 01:40:26.497]  God this morning told me that it's time to release the will.
[01:40:28.038 --> 01:40:31.641]  And, uh, so I'm just putting everybody on notice.
[01:40:31.681 --> 01:40:32.321]  It starts today.
[01:40:32.361 --> 01:40:33.782]  I'm not holding back anything anymore.
[01:40:35.687 --> 01:40:38.289]  I'm gonna, it's not my will, it's God's will.
[01:40:38.889 --> 01:40:43.972]  God's told me to really step it up and not pull back out of not wanting to be arrogant or prideful.
[01:40:43.992 --> 01:40:55.678]  Because, you know, really being what I, what you can all do too, really, really being who I can be and really using my brain against the enemy and my will is a terrible thing.
[01:40:56.058 --> 01:40:56.558]  It's terrible.
[01:40:57.579 --> 01:40:58.099]  I'm scared of it.
[01:40:59.568 --> 01:41:02.429]  And I know it means the enemy's going to come after us too, but it has to be done.
[01:41:02.469 --> 01:41:03.049]  Now is the time.
[01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:04.650]  It's very humbling.
[01:41:05.070 --> 01:41:15.574]  Um, you know, praying for me is very humbling to do that in public because I, when I pray, I am in the presence of God even stronger and messages of the president are very humbling.
[01:41:15.594 --> 01:41:18.696]  Cause I know that Trump's dialed into the metaphysical.
[01:41:18.896 --> 01:41:22.897]  And if I say this is a message to Trump, he gets it.
[01:41:25.338 --> 01:41:26.739]  And that's why I don't do a lot of them because
[01:41:29.013 --> 01:41:37.078]  It's not that I'm intimidated to talk to the president, it's that I better have something important to say when I do it.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:46.524]  If I try not to hurt people, and if I try to hold back, it's just not going to flow.
[01:41:48.085 --> 01:41:51.147]  It's going to probably have some fits and starts, but I'm just going to let them have it.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:42:15.090]  It's like a pressure you know that millisecond a bomb detonates starting to build up right now and I just want the listeners and viewers to know it's in force it's about to go next level because the whole thing's going next level and the enemy is going next level and so I've been holding back because again I'm dialed in and uh
[01:42:16.741 --> 01:42:18.582]  Man, I can just like, it's like, wow.
[01:42:19.023 --> 01:42:21.885]  I mean, it's like a storm that hadn't got there yet.
[01:42:21.945 --> 01:42:23.446]  You see it blowing in across the water.
[01:42:23.947 --> 01:42:25.368]  Then you start seeing the trees start moving.
[01:42:25.408 --> 01:42:29.171]  And when it's actually there, you know, the windows are breaking and it's like, man, I know it's coming.
[01:42:29.631 --> 01:42:30.792]  And it's not me, folks.
[01:42:30.852 --> 01:42:31.793]  It's all of us.
[01:42:31.953 --> 01:42:32.513]  It's big.
[01:42:32.533 --> 01:42:34.895]  Because the enemy is going ahead with it.
[01:42:36.917 --> 01:42:38.498]  That's really what I wanted to say.
[01:42:38.518 --> 01:42:41.400]  And then I thought about what am I going to do coming into break?
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.542]  And what have I been feeling the last few months and weeks?
[01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:49.192]  And it's that Trump can't fix this himself.
[01:42:49.713 --> 01:42:55.218]  And us getting mad at Trump and saying it's his fault or wishing he'd do better is a cop-out.
[01:42:55.278 --> 01:42:55.638]  It's us.
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:01.083]  And what's going to happen is going to happen.
[01:43:01.103 --> 01:43:08.790]  But there's a version where things are light, but we still go through a lot because we need to be punished and get back to reality.
[01:43:10.066 --> 01:43:13.108]  And there's other versions, there's a lot of different versions of this reality.
[01:43:13.508 --> 01:43:16.831]  And there's one down here, if we don't act now and really take action.
[01:43:17.151 --> 01:43:18.952]  That's what people call and they say, you got a lot of courage.
[01:43:19.573 --> 01:43:20.753]  Are you kidding me?
[01:43:22.375 --> 01:43:25.737]  I got a lot of courage if somebody's trying to drop me out of a helicopter into a volcano.
[01:43:26.477 --> 01:43:27.758]  Trying to hold on to the helicopter.
[01:43:27.778 --> 01:43:29.680]  You got a lot of courage, you're fighting hard.
[01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:31.661]  I'm like fighting dudes on a helicopter trying to throw me out.
[01:43:31.681 --> 01:43:33.963]  They're like, damn, you're beating some people's ass, man.
[01:43:34.183 --> 01:43:34.863]  You got a lot of courage.
[01:43:35.244 --> 01:43:37.665]  They're trying to throw me out of a damn helicopter into a lava.
[01:43:39.295 --> 01:43:40.136]  That ain't courage!
[01:43:40.996 --> 01:43:43.198]  That's me holding on by my fingernails, people!
[01:43:43.859 --> 01:43:45.480]  You think this is some kind of game?
[01:43:46.381 --> 01:43:48.162]  You think these people are playing games?
[01:43:48.362 --> 01:43:49.883]  Bill Gates wants to kill you!
[01:43:51.545 --> 01:43:52.846]  He said he wants to kill you!
[01:43:54.607 --> 01:43:55.428]  He's out in the open.
[01:43:59.391 --> 01:44:03.114]  So we should be having a discussion about people that are gonna die in these trials.
[01:44:03.954 --> 01:44:05.876]  People that get sick in the trials of these vaccines.
[01:44:06.096 --> 01:44:06.937]  Now, he's a murderer.
[01:44:07.898 --> 01:44:12.240]  And how we sit there and let his whole system murder people and that he's not held responsible.
[01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:20.704]  I'm not the one whose job it is to decide who lives and who dies.
[01:44:21.924 --> 01:44:23.985]  And he's telling you he's deciding who's living and dying.
[01:44:24.005 --> 01:44:30.328]  And I tell Bill Gates, who I know is a slave of Satan,
[01:44:31.684 --> 01:44:34.506]  That you serve a God that's already been defeated and there's no God.
[01:44:34.886 --> 01:44:36.467]  Because you can't reason with Bill Gates.
[01:44:36.487 --> 01:44:37.808]  You can't make him back down.
[01:44:38.128 --> 01:44:39.329]  You can't make him stop.
[01:44:39.869 --> 01:44:46.033]  Because all he is a big stinking rotting tentacle hanging out of Satan's ass like a hemorrhoid.
[01:44:48.995 --> 01:44:50.616]  So don't try to talk to Bill Gates.
[01:44:50.636 --> 01:44:51.796]  Don't try to reason with him.
[01:44:51.816 --> 01:45:00.382]  Because all he knows is carrying out that mission to poison you and kill you slowly and suck everything out of you.
[01:45:01.192 --> 01:45:02.974]  He runs Monsanto.
[01:45:03.274 --> 01:45:04.836]  He runs it, everything.
[01:45:05.477 --> 01:45:06.779]  That's the little demon.
[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:08.661]  Oh, he's a front man.
[01:45:09.201 --> 01:45:13.266]  Oh, he's a... You know, he acts so evil and giggles about killing people.
[01:45:13.366 --> 01:45:14.327]  He's not a high-level one.
[01:45:15.048 --> 01:45:16.790]  No, the high-level ones hit it before.
[01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:18.812]  Now they're showing you who they are.
[01:45:19.233 --> 01:45:20.554]  We're in a new phase.
[01:45:22.315 --> 01:45:33.867]  And if you can let a demonic elf sit there and tell you how he wants you dead, but oh, he sure loves you, and he sure got a shot for you, he's telling you what he's gonna do to you!
[01:45:42.035 --> 01:45:43.677]  So here's what I'm trying to get at right now.
[01:45:49.904 --> 01:45:55.445]  I don't say this to demoralize you or to make you feel scared or to make you think to give up.
[01:45:55.685 --> 01:45:56.265]  It's the opposite.
[01:45:57.906 --> 01:46:01.446]  But I can tell you that Trump is not in control of almost all these countries.
[01:46:01.866 --> 01:46:03.067]  He's not in control of the UN.
[01:46:03.107 --> 01:46:04.187]  He's trying to get out of it.
[01:46:04.747 --> 01:46:05.967]  He understands the problem now.
[01:46:06.347 --> 01:46:08.268]  He's not in control of the federal government completely.
[01:46:08.928 --> 01:46:09.748]  He can't stop it.
[01:46:09.828 --> 01:46:10.968]  It's all the corporations.
[01:46:11.488 --> 01:46:12.448]  It's all the big banks.
[01:46:12.568 --> 01:46:13.328]  It's the big money.
[01:46:13.448 --> 01:46:14.449]  It's the EU.
[01:46:14.509 --> 01:46:15.629]  It's the Communist Chinese.
[01:46:16.309 --> 01:46:17.570]  It's evil in all our hearts.
[01:46:17.951 --> 01:46:19.192]  It's the Hollywood class.
[01:46:19.272 --> 01:46:20.092]  It's the Satanist.
[01:46:20.393 --> 01:46:21.213]  It's the occultist.
[01:46:21.293 --> 01:46:28.880]  It's the deceivers that have been betting on evil because they believe they're going to get all this power and they believe they're going to get this life extension and they are delusional.
[01:46:29.781 --> 01:46:30.562]  They are cursed.
[01:46:31.362 --> 01:46:37.147]  They have psychic viruses in their brain and their soul and so they're gone.
[01:46:38.569 --> 01:46:42.172]  And they do one thing and that's destroy civilization and it's spreading.
[01:46:44.522 --> 01:46:49.330]  And so, I just want everybody to know, you're not fixing this, and we're gonna go downhill.
[01:46:51.473 --> 01:46:58.945]  Because, God's lifted the hedge of protection, and the minute the hedge of protection's lifted, the enemy comes in, because that's what it does.
[01:47:01.223 --> 01:47:02.503]  And it's a law of the universe, man.
[01:47:02.543 --> 01:47:04.704]  You can't kill third world people.
[01:47:04.784 --> 01:47:05.864]  You can't enslave people.
[01:47:05.944 --> 01:47:07.144]  You can't live off slaves.
[01:47:07.564 --> 01:47:09.025]  You can't kill babies.
[01:47:09.185 --> 01:47:10.225]  You can't devil worship.
[01:47:10.245 --> 01:47:11.005]  You can't be lazy.
[01:47:11.045 --> 01:47:11.865]  You can't be stupid.
[01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:17.466]  And then not have the psychic vampires, the psychic wolves come in and destroy you.
[01:47:17.726 --> 01:47:18.586]  They will do it.
[01:47:19.007 --> 01:47:20.027]  It's blood in the water.
[01:47:20.487 --> 01:47:23.788]  We have been dumping the blood of the innocents into the psychic water of the universe.
[01:47:24.148 --> 01:47:29.369]  We have been human sacrificing and devil worshiping and hurting ourselves and taking all these drugs.
[01:47:29.689 --> 01:47:30.409]  And we're done!
[01:47:31.343 --> 01:47:37.588]  We're going to be absolutely tortured and brutalized, and no one's going to care because they're all satanic.
[01:47:38.049 --> 01:47:47.157]  They'll be getting torn apart, you'll be getting torn apart, and it's just stampeding mass mental illness and delusion and just crashing civilizations.
[01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:57.614]  And up at the top, weird, crazy women just dancing on the death of everything, because Satan wants that image of women leading the earth into death.
[01:47:58.034 --> 01:48:05.857]  And they're going to kill most of the earth, they're going to kill all the animals, all the species, and then celebrate it, and then say that humans did it when the Satanists did it.
[01:48:06.718 --> 01:48:08.158]  Mass death, mass evil.
[01:48:08.178 --> 01:48:08.938]  Get ready, it's coming.
[01:48:10.939 --> 01:48:14.181]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones, and I'm not trying to be negative here today.
[01:48:15.301 --> 01:48:16.822]  I'm not trying to get you down.
[01:48:17.932 --> 01:48:19.092]  We have to face this.
[01:48:19.212 --> 01:48:20.213]  We have to know this.
[01:48:20.293 --> 01:48:21.153]  We have to understand it.
[01:48:21.973 --> 01:48:43.100]  Again, if you're a new listener and you hear me tuning in saying there's a world government with off-world entities that wants to set up a plan to exterminate us, it's mainline science that the big CEOs believe we're in a simulation and that aliens created us and that they're building a world government to set up a super technology to break free that they believe that some entity has enslaved us on this planet.
[01:48:43.741 --> 01:48:45.001]  I mean, it's all right out of the Bible.
[01:48:47.242 --> 01:48:47.362]  And
[01:48:49.019 --> 01:48:54.501]  People could say, well, is this some larger deception where, you know, the actual God did this as a sadist?
[01:48:54.941 --> 01:49:00.063]  That's what the Satanists always say is, oh, your God's a sadist, your God set this up and allowed this.
[01:49:00.163 --> 01:49:06.985]  No, God gave us free will because we're new entities with the potential of God in the millennium.
[01:49:07.566 --> 01:49:16.549]  Not that we're God, we're made little g, image of God, but it's a process to even be able to interface with God.
[01:49:17.964 --> 01:49:29.333]  And if you're God, the only thing you can do that's new is to create new entities that actually have free will and the potential to create whole new universes, whole new realities.
[01:49:30.874 --> 01:49:36.138]  And if you look at the secret Oprah Winfrey, the Satanists all know that's God's plan.
[01:49:36.438 --> 01:49:37.339]  They want it now.
[01:49:39.738 --> 01:49:42.279]  But notice they want to do it at the expense of everybody else's free will.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.401]  We have to submit to them.
[01:49:45.021 --> 01:49:48.763]  We have to behave the way they want us to and then they'll build this utopia.
[01:49:48.963 --> 01:49:58.388]  But you look at a picture of Congresswoman Presley and AOC and just look at the satanic look on their face.
[01:49:58.448 --> 01:49:59.689]  Look at the fake smiling.
[01:50:00.129 --> 01:50:00.870]  Look at all of it.
[01:50:02.590 --> 01:50:03.291]  Look at Joe Biden.
[01:50:03.851 --> 01:50:04.672]  These are all slaves.
[01:50:06.212 --> 01:50:06.913]  These are all jokes.
[01:50:08.803 --> 01:50:16.289]  And they've been told, make war against reality, make war against all that's good, and you will be the king of the universe.
[01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:24.795]  But obviously it's not helping them, it's not helping their constituents, they're destroying themselves because they're following a program that's not of this world.
[01:50:29.038 --> 01:50:35.123]  And that's why everything they do is about looking as alien and weird and creepy as they can, because these are monsters, folks.
[01:50:36.724 --> 01:50:38.927]  Steve Bannon, you know, gets the populism of the world.
[01:50:39.287 --> 01:50:39.948]  Can't be trusted.
[01:50:40.008 --> 01:50:42.791]  But Democrats want destruction of American way of life.
[01:50:43.592 --> 01:50:45.374]  No, they want destruction of humanity.
[01:50:45.694 --> 01:50:50.960]  I always see Tucker Carlson saying, the Democrats hate Trump more than they love America.
[01:50:51.921 --> 01:50:56.847]  And I've said on air, and I've said to Tucker, hey, why don't you and everybody stop saying they hate
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:59.080]  Trump more than love America.
[01:50:59.361 --> 01:51:00.461]  They hate America.
[01:51:00.741 --> 01:51:02.642]  They hate everything it stands for.
[01:51:03.162 --> 01:51:05.143]  Not that we're perfect, but what it stands for.
[01:51:05.543 --> 01:51:10.326]  And notice, you don't hear Republicans now saying that line, they hate Trump more than they love America.
[01:51:10.546 --> 01:51:12.967]  These people don't want the country to exist.
[01:51:16.008 --> 01:51:18.189]  So stop judging them the way you operate.
[01:51:19.930 --> 01:51:22.611]  You know, you eat too much ice cream, you feel bad.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:31.164]  It's the middle of the night, you piss on the toilet seat, you don't wipe it up, I'll let my wife do it, she doesn't work, I'll let her clean my piss up.
[01:51:31.424 --> 01:51:40.670]  You know, I mean literally that's the kind of stuff that I, at 2am, oh god I missed the toilet, I'm gonna let my wife, you know.
[01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:43.992]  That's Alex Jones guilt level stuff, is I pissed on the side of the toilet.
[01:51:44.352 --> 01:51:45.033]  A little squirt.
[01:51:46.954 --> 01:51:51.377]  The globalists aren't just not into guilt, they want to go rape a baby.
[01:51:52.458 --> 01:51:58.762]  They want to go and push that limit and do something really horrible because they like the feeling of God pulling away from them.
[01:51:58.782 --> 01:52:00.803]  They like that sensation of horror.
[01:52:00.823 --> 01:52:03.105]  Not me.
[01:52:03.125 --> 01:52:05.907]  I don't even want to do bad things.
[01:52:07.568 --> 01:52:11.970]  Oh yeah, look at Stephen Colbert letting everybody know who he is with Podesta.
[01:52:14.012 --> 01:52:15.853]  Flashing a full-on Satan face.
[01:52:16.533 --> 01:52:17.474]  And so are the rest of them.
[01:52:19.977 --> 01:52:21.798]  And you get around these people, man, let me tell you something.
[01:52:22.178 --> 01:52:23.199]  I was never a devil worshiper.
[01:52:23.339 --> 01:52:26.141]  I got roped into a couple times, you know, getting brought to it.
[01:52:26.261 --> 01:52:26.921]  The real deal.
[01:52:27.241 --> 01:52:28.422]  Like, eyes wide shut stuff.
[01:52:29.062 --> 01:52:30.804]  I mean, it wasn't quite a castle, but it was close.
[01:52:31.204 --> 01:52:33.005]  The other time it was outdoors, and a big deal.
[01:52:34.065 --> 01:52:40.009]  And let me tell you, they're wearing masks and hoods for a good reason.
[01:52:40.489 --> 01:52:41.350]  Put Colbert back on.
[01:52:41.370 --> 01:52:42.671]  That was a good job pulling that photo up.
[01:52:43.453 --> 01:52:44.974]  Stilter, why do you think Stilter makes that face?
[01:52:45.554 --> 01:52:46.855]  Because that's, that, let me tell you something.
[01:52:47.455 --> 01:52:55.120]  When you're a kid strapped down a two-year-old, grabbing somebody's yard, and you're in a basement, let me tell you, when the door opens up, buddy boy, that's what you gonna see.
[01:52:56.621 --> 01:52:59.923]  You see that look right there, and it's bad.
[01:53:02.184 --> 01:53:07.948]  In fact, most Satanists don't even like to get possessed, and they don't even make that face.
[01:53:08.448 --> 01:53:10.329]  That face is called the Joker, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:16.152 --> 01:53:23.616]  Because when people start making those faces in satanic rituals, while they wear masks, they start stabbing each other in the face.
[01:53:23.636 --> 01:53:27.838]  Because that demon wants one thing, and that's to kill humans.
[01:53:28.659 --> 01:53:29.299]  And there it is.
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:31.961]  You see that look?
[01:53:32.981 --> 01:53:39.124]  They're all into themselves, all into the emptiness, all into the fake glow of satanism.
[01:53:40.665 --> 01:53:45.728]  It's sick, and it's evil, and it's empty, and it's a joke.
[01:53:47.261 --> 01:53:47.801]  And that's it.
[01:53:49.062 --> 01:53:50.963]  It's the Charlie Manson stare, folks.
[01:53:54.624 --> 01:53:56.345]  And that's who they are, children of the devil.
[01:53:59.567 --> 01:54:01.327]  Living for the devil ain't doing too good for them.
[01:54:01.548 --> 01:54:04.109]  You know, people look at me and they say, you know, Jones looks old.
[01:54:04.449 --> 01:54:05.729]  He's 46, like he's 55.
[01:54:06.010 --> 01:54:07.070]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:09.551]  Because I take the weight on my shoulders.
[01:54:10.772 --> 01:54:12.713]  And I'm not afraid of losing my body.
[01:54:13.584 --> 01:54:16.967]  And I do things to my body I shouldn't have done, but I don't serve the devil.
[01:54:18.849 --> 01:54:22.832]  I may look like Fred Flintstone, but don't I look alive?
[01:54:22.852 --> 01:54:28.257]  Don't I look like I got blood coursing through my veins and I'm tied into something good?
[01:54:28.357 --> 01:54:32.460]  Yeah.
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:35.843]  A lot of wear on these tires, but I like all the scratches and cuts and dents.
[01:54:35.863 --> 01:54:36.544]  It makes me who I am.
[01:54:36.564 --> 01:54:37.665]  But let's look at those people.
[01:54:37.705 --> 01:54:38.405]  Put them back on screen.
[01:54:39.026 --> 01:54:39.987]  You couldn't pay me
[01:54:42.123 --> 01:54:46.344]  I was reading about how Kamala Harris put a guy in jail when they had the DNA test and knew he was innocent.
[01:54:46.364 --> 01:54:47.405]  He didn't even have a criminal record.
[01:54:47.425 --> 01:54:48.505]  He was a good guy they put in jail.
[01:54:48.845 --> 01:54:58.748]  It's one thing if somebody's already had like five rapes and a murder and they're out of jail for 20, you know, after 20 years and you're not sure, you don't frame them, but the evidence looks like they did it okay, send them back to prison.
[01:54:58.768 --> 01:54:59.388]  That's bad enough.
[01:55:01.308 --> 01:55:10.491]  But imagine knowing somebody's totally innocent and keeping them in jail for 18 years till the killer actually got found separately by people that weren't corrupt like her.
[01:55:12.759 --> 01:55:15.842]  And then the guy got paid $18 million, a million dollars for each year.
[01:55:16.722 --> 01:55:19.285]  You couldn't pay me a billion dollars to stay in some jail.
[01:55:22.487 --> 01:55:23.628]  Oh, he shouldn't get $18 million.
[01:55:23.969 --> 01:55:26.531]  It's all a big, sick joke.
[01:55:27.392 --> 01:55:31.055]  So if you're a radio listener, you know, you really got a good thing happening for you.
[01:55:31.075 --> 01:55:40.243]  You don't need to look at the left, but can you imagine walking around in the halls of those places now?
[01:55:41.584 --> 01:55:51.949]  In the year 2020, they're making satanic faces that satanists 30 years ago, 35 years ago, won't even make themselves.
[01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:57.191]  Because see, satanists want to be in control of the demons.
[01:55:58.552 --> 01:55:59.992]  They don't want to be run by them.
[01:56:02.334 --> 01:56:05.515]  But see, it's a whole new game plan now, ain't it?
[01:56:07.472 --> 01:56:09.873]  And that's why they walk around in Congress.
[01:56:09.973 --> 01:56:10.954]  I've been there and I've seen it.
[01:56:11.354 --> 01:56:16.596]  And they walk up to each other and go, like in all the movies of a supervillain.
[01:56:16.956 --> 01:56:19.958]  Why does a supervillain have a big evil smile on their face and cackle and laugh?
[01:56:20.298 --> 01:56:22.519]  Because they're turned over to evil.
[01:56:22.779 --> 01:56:24.460]  They're dialed into that channel.
[01:56:28.982 --> 01:56:30.983]  And they can't stop it.
[01:56:32.642 --> 01:56:35.965]  Governor Newsom loves all the suicides and crime and everybody moving out.
[01:56:36.325 --> 01:56:37.106]  He loves it.
[01:56:37.126 --> 01:56:38.126]  He's bringing down the whole country.
[01:56:38.147 --> 01:56:38.827]  That's his job.
[01:56:39.347 --> 01:56:40.408]  He's a military officer.
[01:56:41.029 --> 01:56:44.332]  And of course, his wineries are the only ones with restaurants all over the state.
[01:56:45.613 --> 01:56:47.094]  Backed by Nancy Pelosi money.
[01:56:47.514 --> 01:56:49.175]  Makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year profit.
[01:56:49.796 --> 01:56:50.457]  His stay open.
[01:56:50.477 --> 01:56:51.337]  People go, why are yours?
[01:56:51.357 --> 01:56:52.678]  He goes, they do stay open.
[01:56:53.899 --> 01:56:54.680]  You go, well that's evil.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.484]  It's about rubbing it in and laughing and cackling at you.
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:03.201]  It's about teaching you to submit to them.
[01:57:05.082 --> 01:57:09.624]  The UK is not becoming a police state, it is one, where there's no speech, nothing, it's all collapsing.
[01:57:09.684 --> 01:57:10.304]  Europe, same thing.
[01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:11.024]  And now here.
[01:57:13.905 --> 01:57:14.966]  Yippee-ki-yay.
[01:57:17.887 --> 01:57:19.487]  Let's go to break, I'll come back at the important news.
[01:57:19.507 --> 01:57:21.348]  McBreen's put something special together for us, stay with us.
[01:57:23.029 --> 01:57:26.550]  They never intended to end the lockdown, they said they would never end it, they war-gamed it all.
[01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:28.551]  And so you gotta tell your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[01:57:30.956 --> 01:57:34.522]  Constantly, what the plan is and that compliance is death.
[01:57:36.344 --> 01:57:42.173]  You know, I remember reading Siemens and Google documents that were public over 10 years ago about how
[01:57:43.584 --> 01:57:52.246]  In the future, all cars will be driverless, and how they would just phase in the driverless features for safety at first, where if you go out of the lane, it takes back control.
[01:57:52.266 --> 01:57:59.628]  Now all the Chevys have that, and pretty soon, you know, it knows when you're on your phone, it won't just have you say, hey, I'm not driving, and then let you be on the phone.
[01:57:59.928 --> 01:58:03.789]  It'll have to face print that you're not driving, and then if you are, it's okay, it'll just take control.
[01:58:04.509 --> 01:58:05.809]  It's all surveilling you.
[01:58:05.829 --> 01:58:08.150]  It all sounds like it's good, it's an anti-state.
[01:58:09.923 --> 01:58:14.026]  But they admit the next move is they're going to put gates and bridges up that block the roads.
[01:58:16.568 --> 01:58:30.859]  And the public's going to accept that because the riots and the societal collapse that they're bringing in now for the next five years are going to be so bad that we're going to finally accept, well, you don't go outdoors unless they say to stop the riots.
[01:58:31.199 --> 01:58:33.060]  Plus the COVID, we're already all used to it.
[01:58:34.682 --> 01:58:37.544]  This is a permanent martial law scenario.
[01:58:40.066 --> 01:58:45.008]  Now there's this huge article up on Infowars.com that I should have just led the whole show with.
[01:58:45.028 --> 01:58:47.409]  It's from townhall.com.
[01:58:47.429 --> 01:58:49.369]  It fits in everything we warned you about.
[01:58:49.649 --> 01:58:52.190]  Maxine Waters, Congress can remove Trump without impeachment.
[01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:53.191]  We're going to cover this in a moment.
[01:58:55.912 --> 01:58:59.973]  Now I told you, get ready for them to start saying we don't need impeachment to remove him.
[01:59:01.053 --> 01:59:02.994]  What did Brennan and Clapper say three years ago?
[01:59:03.494 --> 01:59:05.215]  We're going to remove him without impeachment.
[01:59:08.083 --> 01:59:10.764]  Now, of course, that's not just martial law.
[01:59:11.585 --> 01:59:12.865]  That's not just civil war.
[01:59:14.846 --> 01:59:16.807]  That is actual treason.
[01:59:21.249 --> 01:59:23.590]  But see, the psych warfare chief's running this.
[01:59:24.331 --> 01:59:25.451]  You're in a lockdown.
[01:59:25.471 --> 01:59:26.312]  You're in a race riot.
[01:59:26.352 --> 01:59:28.313]  You see people shooting people at checkpoints.
[01:59:28.653 --> 01:59:29.493]  They're the good guys.
[01:59:29.773 --> 01:59:31.314]  The people that fight back are the bad guys.
[01:59:34.015 --> 01:59:34.336]  And now,
[01:59:35.689 --> 01:59:36.569]  Get the video of this.
[01:59:36.749 --> 01:59:37.750]  She came out and said this.
[01:59:39.010 --> 01:59:39.591]  Look at all this.
[01:59:39.611 --> 01:59:40.951]  This is paragraph after paragraph of this crap.
[01:59:41.471 --> 01:59:44.312]  I'll have to take 15 minutes in the next hour of Salente.
[01:59:44.973 --> 01:59:53.076]  I know I'm doing an interview at 2.30, but I'm going to have to just... I'm going to have to cover this.
[01:59:53.876 --> 01:59:57.677]  But see, how it works is you've heard me say it so much, and you've kind of heard them say it so much now.
[01:59:57.717 --> 01:59:58.978]  It's going, alright, well, they're going to...
[02:00:00.782 --> 02:00:02.624]  I mean, obviously the big story is the Post Office.
[02:00:03.164 --> 02:00:07.469]  They go, we want $25 billion extra after Obama defunded it.
[02:00:11.473 --> 02:00:21.103]  We want $25 billion extra so we can pay off the Postal Service to take all these stuffed ballots and fake ballots and do all this crap.
[02:00:22.024 --> 02:00:22.925]  It's totally illegal.
[02:00:24.056 --> 02:00:28.380]  But Chuck Schumer and all them turning around and go, Trump's violating the vote!
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:40.650]  He doesn't want you to have your mail-in ballot, which in Michigan, and California, and all over they're finding, is like, I saw one report, a third of them are dead people!
[02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:42.271]  They're mailing it in!
[02:00:42.311 --> 02:00:43.172]  They're caught!
[02:00:43.893 --> 02:00:46.415]  Who do you think's filling out the names of dead people?
[02:00:48.865 --> 02:00:56.530]  They're sending them to every Democrat household knowing full well that they're going to put Grandma on there who died five years ago.
[02:00:58.811 --> 02:01:01.853]  And they're now saying they're not even going to check the voter rolls in most states.
[02:01:02.153 --> 02:01:04.915]  If a name comes through, they're just going to say it was a vote.
[02:01:12.079 --> 02:01:14.060]  Oh, but Fauci says we can vote in person.
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:14.861]  Isn't he nice?
[02:01:17.062 --> 02:01:18.183]  Oh, Fauci said
[02:01:19.281 --> 02:01:22.982]  Fauci said I can have another shot.
[02:01:23.062 --> 02:01:23.862]  It'll keep me safe.
[02:01:23.902 --> 02:01:27.603]  I mean, he's the guy that tells us what we can do.
[02:01:33.364 --> 02:01:34.905]  But we have to keep our spirits up.
[02:01:35.225 --> 02:01:36.185]  We just have to get the word out.
[02:01:36.945 --> 02:01:41.606]  But at the same time, you know, I just say what I know is true.
[02:01:44.547 --> 02:01:46.808]  And I've analyzed this thing up one side and down the other.
[02:01:46.828 --> 02:01:47.488]  I know you have too.
[02:01:49.528 --> 02:02:01.739]  I didn't get up here five, six months ago and say a collapse of the first world will kill the third world because I wanted to be shocking.
[02:02:02.399 --> 02:02:03.440]  I looked at the numbers.
[02:02:06.022 --> 02:02:14.330]  Five billion people, roughly, of the seven and a half billion on this planet, spend more than half of their paycheck of the money they get on food.
[02:02:15.796 --> 02:02:21.300]  And there's actuaries that when you start spending more than a third of your money on food, it means you're in a precarious situation.
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:26.184]  When you're spending over half on your food, it means you're in a very dangerous situation.
[02:02:27.225 --> 02:02:35.711]  All they gotta do with those five billion people is shut down the Western economy for about five months.
[02:02:35.791 --> 02:02:36.992]  They've already done it, folks.
[02:02:38.527 --> 02:02:49.150]  And then the chain reaction will cattywampus all the supply chains out of the first world and the third world, because we're getting the supply from them, and then we're sending back money and other infrastructure.
[02:02:49.651 --> 02:02:50.611]  And it's a death sentence.
[02:02:52.251 --> 02:02:56.513]  And I don't sit here talking about how I care about these third world people like I'm some goody two-shoe.
[02:02:56.633 --> 02:02:57.553]  I care about myself.
[02:02:59.073 --> 02:03:00.754]  And I know that we're next.
[02:03:01.154 --> 02:03:02.575]  And I feel bad for them too, man.
[02:03:02.635 --> 02:03:06.296]  I mean, I'm getting chills right now.
[02:03:07.546 --> 02:03:14.691]  In that I'm not getting chills before when I was talking about all these people and I was just saying it without really feeling anything.
[02:03:15.011 --> 02:03:16.512]  Because I'm getting so comfortable with it.
[02:03:17.073 --> 02:03:17.833]  Because that's how it works.
[02:03:17.853 --> 02:03:21.716]  Even though I don't want to do it, I'm getting comfortable with it because my mind's already made friends with it.
[02:03:21.736 --> 02:03:23.337]  Because I want to deal with it.
[02:03:23.517 --> 02:03:24.238]  I want to overcome it.
[02:03:24.518 --> 02:03:29.041]  But there's a sick level where if you overcome it by just accepting it, you've not overcome it, you've submit to it.
[02:03:29.542 --> 02:03:32.264]  So then I thought about that, I got that big chill.
[02:03:32.344 --> 02:03:35.046]  Not the good chill, the one, the God-fearing chill.
[02:03:35.686 --> 02:03:40.087]  Where you get the little directive that, yeah, you don't even think about not caring.
[02:03:40.347 --> 02:03:43.368]  Because, see, one part of me is like trying to get used to it.
[02:03:43.448 --> 02:03:44.949]  Just screw these people.
[02:03:45.009 --> 02:03:46.889]  God, Bill Gates is going to kill them all.
[02:03:46.949 --> 02:03:47.290]  Jesus.
[02:03:47.370 --> 02:03:53.311]  You know, I mean, you know, and I'm just trying to work my brain around this, man, because here's the thing.
[02:03:53.831 --> 02:03:57.072]  You know what a lot of my cells are saying?
[02:03:57.092 --> 02:03:58.313]  I know what your cells are saying, too.
[02:03:59.013 --> 02:04:02.094]  The people killing everybody, they're the ones that need to be brought to justice.
[02:04:03.454 --> 02:04:05.235]  And I don't talk about killing lightly.
[02:04:07.619 --> 02:04:19.146]  But I just think we should all pray that all these New World Order people be brought to justice by God, and God will answer back and say, are you protesting outside the abortion clinics?
[02:04:20.046 --> 02:04:21.867]  Are you standing up against the genetic engineering?
[02:04:22.768 --> 02:04:26.330]  Are you humbling yourself?
[02:04:28.891 --> 02:04:29.711]  Are you protesting?
[02:04:29.831 --> 02:04:30.852]  Are you involved?
[02:04:30.972 --> 02:04:33.332]  God wants to see us put God first.
[02:04:33.692 --> 02:04:42.334]  God wants to see us turn off the Netflix, put down the whiskey bottle, I'm talking to myself, and to everybody else, and God wants to see us go out there.
[02:04:43.015 --> 02:04:45.675]  God wants to see you arrested for freedom.
[02:04:46.376 --> 02:04:55.958]  God wants to see you go through some fire before God starts doing what we want.
[02:04:58.194 --> 02:05:05.918]  If a billion people turned away from Satan and prayed today that the head of this whole COVID hoax be struck dead, he'd be dead by midnight.
[02:05:07.519 --> 02:05:19.565]  If a billion people repented in their heart and God knew it was real, because God can see if it's real, and God already knows what you're going to do once you make the decision, if you have that decision, then we'd be delivered today.
[02:05:23.407 --> 02:05:27.249]  But God's not going to deliver somebody that doesn't want to be delivered.
[02:05:28.268 --> 02:05:40.799]  That's why when they're leaving Sodom and Gomorrah and the wife looks back, God says, don't look back, and she gets frozen into a pillar of salt because she didn't want to leave it.
[02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:43.241]  You've got to revolt it.
[02:05:43.361 --> 02:05:44.262]  You've got to hate it.
[02:05:44.542 --> 02:05:45.723]  You've got to turn it loose.
[02:05:45.763 --> 02:05:47.324]  You've got to really not want it.
[02:05:49.366 --> 02:05:55.752]  And if you don't want the New World Order, if it revolts you and you want away from it and you're not scared of it and you don't care what happens to you, you're in God's presence.
[02:05:57.261 --> 02:06:05.166]  But if you're worried about what people think, if you're worried about the world, then they got you and you're looking back at it.
[02:06:06.007 --> 02:06:07.087]  So you might as well just go down there.
[02:06:07.608 --> 02:06:10.189]  Because let me tell you, it's all gonna burn.
[02:06:18.354 --> 02:06:20.075]  We fund our operation selling products.
[02:06:20.095 --> 02:06:22.297]  We've got a big sale going right now on InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:06:23.715 --> 02:06:27.798]  And a lot of items that were sold out, like the fish oil, are back and they're discounted and they're really good.
[02:06:28.638 --> 02:06:33.221]  Um, storable food, they really told me is one to two weeks for delivery, but they said, don't say that.
[02:06:33.781 --> 02:06:34.782]  And I said, then don't tell me that.
[02:06:36.636 --> 02:06:37.656]  But they're great people.
[02:06:37.936 --> 02:06:40.137]  Get your storable food orders in at m4store.com.
[02:06:40.497 --> 02:06:42.138]  It's two to three weeks to get it delivered to you.
[02:06:42.478 --> 02:06:43.398]  Really good containers.
[02:06:43.458 --> 02:06:45.278]  Highest quality food for the price you're going to get it.
[02:06:45.298 --> 02:06:47.599]  You can pay five times more and get gourmet food that tastes better.
[02:06:48.019 --> 02:06:50.220]  But most of this stuff tastes really good and it's all nutritious.
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:58.142]  A few of the things, you know, aren't my favorite, but I mean, compared to other stuff, for the price, it's that nexus point of really high quality, good nutrients, great containers, great portability.
[02:06:58.702 --> 02:07:02.944]  President Trump this week again fueling this false, this racist, birther conspiracy theory about Senator Harris.
[02:07:02.964 --> 02:07:09.506]  What do you make of the president going back to, you know, this sort of old movie we've already seen before from this president with a new character now in Senator Harris?
[02:07:24.382 --> 02:07:29.604]  The president of the United States of America is unbelievably divisive.
[02:07:30.304 --> 02:07:31.544]  The president lies.
[02:07:32.084 --> 02:07:38.406]  He's pitting people against each other, going back to the Obertha argument that they attempted to use against Obama.
[02:07:38.846 --> 02:07:45.728]  This is a president that is the most deplorable human being that I've ever encountered in my life.
[02:07:46.328 --> 02:07:46.768]  I think?
[02:08:08.575 --> 02:08:08.995]  We're good to
[02:08:25.604 --> 02:08:42.668]  For Section 4 of Amendment 25 to be put in place and his cabinet should send to Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker, as I think it's been identified in the Constitution, that this man should be removed from office.
[02:08:43.169 --> 02:08:45.369]  Section 25 should be put in place.
[02:08:45.649 --> 02:08:46.509]  He is dangerous.
[02:08:46.789 --> 02:08:50.911]  He is tearing up again, you know, this country, undermining our democracy.
[02:08:51.231 --> 02:08:52.451]  And I want to tell you something.
[02:08:52.951 --> 02:09:00.676]  I'm getting more complaints about what he's doing to the post office than I have on any other issue in my district.
[02:09:00.976 --> 02:09:02.517]  He cannot have our post office.
[02:09:02.977 --> 02:09:04.018]  He cannot do this.
[02:09:04.258 --> 02:09:05.299]  We've got to stop him.
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:07.840]  Wow.
[02:09:08.661 --> 02:09:10.762]  Yeah, Biden did get Kamala Harris.
[02:09:10.782 --> 02:09:14.364]  She is appointed by the establishment to be our new president after he steps down.
[02:09:14.384 --> 02:09:17.166]  A little bit of a slip up by that lady.
[02:09:17.827 --> 02:09:21.509]  You notice in the newscast, they didn't show what Trump said.
[02:09:22.619 --> 02:09:26.745]  They just said, have you heard that because both her parents weren't born here, there's some question about where she was born.
[02:09:27.145 --> 02:09:28.207]  He said, no, that's interesting.
[02:09:28.347 --> 02:09:29.348]  I haven't seen that.
[02:09:29.368 --> 02:09:30.209]  I need to look into that.
[02:09:30.710 --> 02:09:34.856]  Why don't we, for next segment, pull up Trump on Kamala Harris and the birther thing.
[02:09:35.136 --> 02:09:35.717]  He's like, I haven't.
[02:09:36.117 --> 02:09:36.818]  I just heard that.
[02:09:36.938 --> 02:09:37.299]  I don't know.
[02:09:37.339 --> 02:09:37.860]  I'll look at it.
[02:09:39.824 --> 02:09:44.050]  That turns it incredibly divisive whenever his birth or stuff.
[02:09:44.831 --> 02:09:48.916]  Obama was the editor of the Harvard Law Review for three years.
[02:09:49.637 --> 02:09:56.165]  And in three of those three years, he wrote in the forward on his bio that he was born in Kenya.
[02:09:56.766 --> 02:09:58.326]  Because that sounded trendy and cool.
[02:09:58.366 --> 02:10:10.590]  Of course, he was born in Hawaii to Frank Marshall Davis and it's confirmed the head of the Communist Party in Hawaii and a famous pornographer who shot porno films with his mother in lesbian Betty Page movies.
[02:10:11.110 --> 02:10:13.691]  By the way, I've seen the movies, not just the photos.
[02:10:15.009 --> 02:10:16.650]  Pretty big, pretty hot slut, actually.
[02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:17.490]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:22.872]  The point is, is that, is that, is that, is that, of course they covered that up!
[02:10:23.192 --> 02:10:33.815]  And then he wrote in dreams of my father about staying at Frank in the summer, who was like his real dad, and then later his grandfather would go and hang out with Frank Marshall Davis, and Obama stayed there on the summers!
[02:10:34.175 --> 02:10:35.196]  Frank Marshall Davis!
[02:10:36.328 --> 02:10:38.550]  Frank, and I apologize, the family show was being funny there.
[02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:43.633]  No, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it, I mean, I, I, I'm not big into porn and all that stuff, but I like the Betty Page type stuff.
[02:10:44.453 --> 02:10:47.736]  And, uh, there's a whole collection of porn with his mom.
[02:10:48.476 --> 02:10:53.980]  And, and, uh, and that was pretty, I mean, that's how communists made money though, is they ran pornography.
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.022]  And see, she was a CIA sex operative who'd obviously infiltrated the communists.
[02:10:58.043 --> 02:10:58.743]  This is all admitted.
[02:10:59.223 --> 02:11:01.585]  And his grandfather was in the federal reserve and all the rest of it.
[02:11:02.025 --> 02:11:04.047]  I mean, Obama is hooked up, man.
[02:11:04.527 --> 02:11:05.968]  Mother is a sex operative.
[02:11:07.213 --> 02:11:11.636]  And then they make the jokes about Michelle being a tranny, and then Joan Rivers says, no, she is a tranny.
[02:11:11.876 --> 02:11:13.097]  She's got shoulders bigger than mine.
[02:11:13.117 --> 02:11:14.238]  And I got big shoulders, folks.
[02:11:14.258 --> 02:11:16.459]  I mean, she's got shoulders like an NFL linebacker.
[02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:20.382]  And then she walks around with like a roll of silver dollars in her pants.
[02:11:21.583 --> 02:11:22.243]  And then I'm like, okay.
[02:11:22.283 --> 02:11:28.788]  And then like, in his own books, he admits he was raised by a transsexual man, woman.
[02:11:29.929 --> 02:11:33.311]  And it's just, in Indonesia, it's just weirder than hell.
[02:11:33.811 --> 02:11:35.993]  And they always say, Joan says,
[02:11:37.714 --> 02:11:39.716]  Michael Obama, which he keeps calling Michael.
[02:11:39.776 --> 02:11:40.576]  I really love Michael.
[02:11:40.596 --> 02:11:41.297]  He does it on purpose.
[02:11:42.778 --> 02:11:50.203]  They planted the Kenya thing as the cover for Frank Marshall Davis and all those lesbian films he shot with Obama's mama.
[02:11:51.584 --> 02:11:52.125]  There you go.
[02:11:52.785 --> 02:11:54.506]  There's LeBron James right there on screen.
[02:11:55.247 --> 02:11:55.747]  We'll be right back.
[02:11:55.767 --> 02:11:56.168]  Stay with us.
[02:11:57.249 --> 02:12:05.395]  Folks, if you think globalism is out of control, well, it's like this song says, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:12:06.411 --> 02:12:07.451]  And I'm not trying to scare you.
[02:12:08.611 --> 02:12:11.832]  If bad guys are coming for you and your family coming for mine, I believe in you.
[02:12:12.872 --> 02:12:14.372]  And I believe we should make preparation for it.
[02:12:14.472 --> 02:12:14.992]  We are here.
[02:12:15.032 --> 02:12:15.553]  We're being honest.
[02:12:16.153 --> 02:12:17.333]  So, hey, here it is!
[02:12:17.353 --> 02:12:19.973]  And he's seen nothing yet.
[02:12:22.834 --> 02:12:23.574]  Never gonna forget.
[02:12:23.594 --> 02:12:28.135]  Actually, we forget about a thousand years.
[02:12:29.535 --> 02:12:30.255]  They let him out again.
[02:12:31.175 --> 02:12:35.596]  Like releasing... Zod and Superman.
[02:12:39.653 --> 02:12:40.994]  They let him out of the Phantom Zone again.
[02:12:48.617 --> 02:12:48.957]  All right.
[02:12:50.117 --> 02:12:53.619]  The story up on Infowars.com and originates from townhall.com.
[02:12:54.219 --> 02:12:57.100]  Maxine Waters, Congress can remove Trump without impeachment.
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:12:59.681]  She calls it Section 2-5.
[02:13:00.141 --> 02:13:03.182]  It's actually Article 2-5.
[02:13:05.303 --> 02:13:06.964]  And that is the president unfit
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:11.602]  Like Woodrow Wilson had a stroke and for a year they kept it secret.
[02:13:11.622 --> 02:13:12.923]  Well, no, that's not the case.
[02:13:13.104 --> 02:13:15.325]  So, that's why they have watched some post headlines.
[02:13:15.846 --> 02:13:20.750]  When Trump is removed under the 25th Amendment, anyone that resists will be put in prison.
[02:13:21.550 --> 02:13:24.613]  Well, you have to have the cabinet all agree that that's the case.
[02:13:24.633 --> 02:13:28.516]  Because they all agree the president's had a stroke or heart attack and his brain dead.
[02:13:29.377 --> 02:13:32.399]  Or, you know, he's writing on the walls with his crap or whatever.
[02:13:32.839 --> 02:13:33.980]  That's not what's happening.
[02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:36.883]  So she's trying to say, we're going to threaten his cabinet
[02:13:37.639 --> 02:13:44.165]  They're going to have enough martial law, enough riots, enough financial collapse to blame on Trump to say, you're all going down, throw him overboard.
[02:13:44.385 --> 02:13:45.766]  And that's the admitted battle plan.
[02:13:48.569 --> 02:13:54.794]  And even if he wins the election, which I believe he will, in a landslide, will it be enough to override all the fraud?
[02:13:54.814 --> 02:13:57.637]  Or Democrats say they're going to block it.
[02:13:58.398 --> 02:14:01.721]  And I know, again, I have hundreds of articles and dozens of incredible clips, but
[02:14:02.646 --> 02:14:05.527]  You understand that the lockdown's permanent.
[02:14:06.008 --> 02:14:06.728]  It never ends.
[02:14:06.808 --> 02:14:13.791]  It's about martial law control, forced inoculations, digital currencies, everyone tattling and spying on you when you go around.
[02:14:14.111 --> 02:14:15.392]  It's the end of everything, folks.
[02:14:15.452 --> 02:14:21.754]  It's an authoritarian orgy, because the megabanks stole all the money and are delusional that they're going to merge the machines and become gods.
[02:14:22.234 --> 02:14:24.615]  And they've got op-eds everywhere about, let's get rid of all humans.
[02:14:24.936 --> 02:14:26.776]  COVID-19 shows were obsolete.
[02:14:27.077 --> 02:14:28.657]  And people just go, what is this?
[02:14:29.017 --> 02:14:30.078]  It's the cult, man!
[02:14:33.066 --> 02:14:34.427]  They work with the aliens!
[02:14:35.527 --> 02:14:40.649]  I don't obsess on flying saucers and, you know, the astronauts are at the moon and something's following them.
[02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:46.071]  They're not flying around and flying saucers, folks.
[02:14:46.191 --> 02:14:49.933]  They come through the other dimensions, and which are mathematically proven.
[02:14:51.833 --> 02:14:52.974]  And which the globalists believe.
[02:14:55.441 --> 02:14:58.083]  So you could sit there and go, Jones is crazy.
[02:14:58.103 --> 02:14:59.765]  But notice, you never see articles attacking me.
[02:15:00.145 --> 02:15:03.148]  They go, Jones says there's slave colonies on Mars.
[02:15:03.788 --> 02:15:05.110]  $1 million reward, never said it.
[02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:06.411]  Absolutely not true.
[02:15:10.915 --> 02:15:12.896]  I said, they're here with us right now.
[02:15:14.398 --> 02:15:17.681]  And they're using humans to build aliens here on Earth.
[02:15:18.221 --> 02:15:20.903]  And the media did make a joke about that five years ago, but they don't joke now.
[02:15:22.011 --> 02:15:28.817]  The New Scientist, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times all said, months after I did, that COVID-19 is an alien!
[02:15:33.621 --> 02:15:35.423]  You understand with genetic engineering.
[02:15:37.810 --> 02:15:42.334]  But nanotech, that's what these new viruses are, they're completely lab made at the molecular level.
[02:15:42.614 --> 02:15:47.518]  That we could be sent a radio transmission from Alpha Centauri, 30 light years away or whatever it is.
[02:15:47.718 --> 02:15:50.920]  Look up how many light years Alpha Centauri is, I know it's one of the closest.
[02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:52.141]  29 million, 33 million, I forget.
[02:15:54.964 --> 02:16:01.889]  We could be sent a transmission from Sirius, the globalists think that's where the aliens that set up the planet come from.
[02:16:02.129 --> 02:16:03.490]  That's in their cult, I'm not saying that.
[02:16:03.731 --> 02:16:05.412]  I don't know, I know God's real, that's what I follow.
[02:16:09.565 --> 02:16:14.627]  But, that stupid movie, it's a cheesy movie, but it's really accurate of what the globalists are into.
[02:16:15.727 --> 02:16:16.328]  Species!
[02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:25.391]  Where they, aliens, Sin City, the radio telescope, with 4,367 light years.
[02:16:25.431 --> 02:16:28.372]  What's the one that's, what's the closest star to Earth?
[02:16:28.492 --> 02:16:29.253]  My memory's failing.
[02:16:31.713 --> 02:16:33.814]  What's the one that lights only take 30 years to get to?
[02:16:36.915 --> 02:16:38.156]  Anyways, let me get back to what I was saying.
[02:16:44.448 --> 02:16:46.710]  It's only 4.3 light years, so it is the closest, okay.
[02:16:47.530 --> 02:16:59.700]  So, imagine they send us a code on how to build a microorganism and then the thing takes over.
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:02.342]  Why would you take what aliens give you and build it?
[02:17:07.806 --> 02:17:09.027]  But that's what this is, folks.
[02:17:09.928 --> 02:17:10.869]  That's what all this is.
[02:17:12.133 --> 02:17:14.834]  And it's not who we are, and it's not good, and it's going to kill us.
[02:17:16.094 --> 02:17:22.876]  And the globalists are in the New York Times going, we believe in trans-Spermian, we're from aliens, none of them believe in atheism.
[02:17:23.356 --> 02:17:24.156]  None of them!
[02:17:24.516 --> 02:17:25.216]  None of them!
[02:17:25.897 --> 02:17:28.957]  And the transmission they're getting is, don't listen to Christ.
[02:17:29.758 --> 02:17:30.538]  Become a god.
[02:17:30.618 --> 02:17:31.398]  Give up your body.
[02:17:31.438 --> 02:17:32.938]  We got one transmission.
[02:17:37.773 --> 02:17:41.236]  And the big guy was willing to, like, literally avatar down here.
[02:17:41.996 --> 02:17:43.137]  That's what all this is, folks.
[02:17:43.818 --> 02:17:53.665]  And then these other jerks are just swarming around us, like sharks in another dimension, trying to get CERN to build a weapon to blow a hole in the time-space continuum.
[02:17:54.746 --> 02:17:58.869]  But they can't get in, so they just keep trying to get us to blow the planet up.
[02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:00.731]  You're like, why?
[02:18:00.851 --> 02:18:01.992]  Because they're losers.
[02:18:02.312 --> 02:18:03.033]  They're jerks.
[02:18:06.886 --> 02:18:09.609]  I'm going to stop getting hypothetical and theoretical here with you.
[02:18:09.649 --> 02:18:17.977]  Let's play what Trump really said about Kamala Harris and then what Living in America had to say.
[02:18:17.997 --> 02:18:18.318]  Here we go.
[02:18:19.319 --> 02:18:27.067]  Can you definitively say whether or not Kamala Harris is eligible, meets the legal requirements to run as Vice President?
[02:18:27.387 --> 02:18:30.050]  So I just heard that, I heard it today.
[02:18:31.534 --> 02:18:33.235]  That she doesn't meet the requirements.
[02:18:34.316 --> 02:18:39.919]  And by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer.
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:42.001]  I have no idea if that's right.
[02:18:42.021 --> 02:18:47.584]  I would have thought I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president.
[02:18:48.305 --> 02:18:49.585]  But that's a very serious.
[02:18:49.645 --> 02:18:53.588]  You're saying that they're saying that she doesn't qualify because she wasn't born in this country.
[02:18:54.108 --> 02:19:00.655]  No, she was born in this country but her parents did not, the claims say that her parents did not receive their permanent residence at that time.
[02:19:01.115 --> 02:19:01.916]  I don't know about it.
[02:19:01.996 --> 02:19:02.777]  I just heard about it.
[02:19:02.817 --> 02:19:03.437]  I'll take a look.
[02:19:04.398 --> 02:19:08.682]  So that turns into he should be removed in office and she lies.
[02:19:08.863 --> 02:19:11.085]  Here is Maxine Waters.
[02:19:13.237 --> 02:19:19.646]  President Trump this week again fueling this false, this racist birther conspiracy theory about Senator Harris.
[02:19:20.067 --> 02:19:27.979]  What do you make of the president going back to, you know, this sort of old movie we've already seen before from this president with a new character now in Senator Harris?
[02:19:29.569 --> 02:19:34.791]  The president of the United States of America is unbelievably divisive.
[02:19:35.491 --> 02:19:36.732]  The president lies.
[02:19:37.272 --> 02:19:43.594]  He's pitting people against each other, going back to the Obertha argument that they attempted to use against Obama.
[02:19:44.034 --> 02:19:50.917]  This is a president that is the most deplorable human being that I've ever encountered in my life.
[02:19:51.497 --> 02:19:53.778]  And he's undermining our democracy.
[02:19:54.258 --> 02:19:56.598]  We cannot take any more of this president.
[02:19:56.959 --> 02:20:09.362]  This president is not only attacking the person that was just appointed or selected by Biden to be his vice president, and he is not hesitant to do it.
[02:20:10.422 --> 02:20:11.822]  This man has no shame.
[02:20:12.523 --> 02:20:13.403]  The name calling.
[02:20:13.763 --> 02:20:14.263]  We're good.
[02:20:30.809 --> 02:20:32.790]  Wow, that's enough.
[02:20:51.542 --> 02:20:54.646]  No, the Democrats should be removed for being against the existence of the country.
[02:20:54.786 --> 02:20:59.712]  CHICOM operatives who've destroyed every city they've got, by design, try to bring this country down.
[02:20:59.772 --> 02:21:02.135]  Speaking of that, Joe Sloat, he's coming up, he'll break it all down.
[02:21:02.575 --> 02:21:04.057]  You need high-quality, storable food, folks.
[02:21:04.097 --> 02:21:05.519]  We have the best place at the best price.
[02:21:06.019 --> 02:21:08.842]  Now there are only one to two weeks for delivery before the big rush comes.
[02:21:09.804 --> 02:21:10.985]  Because things are just going to get crazier.
[02:21:11.005 --> 02:21:12.065]  You need to get your storable food now.
[02:21:12.426 --> 02:21:13.826]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:21:14.267 --> 02:21:18.689]  And our Ultimate Fish Oil is back in stock with a big discount and free shipping and a bunch of other specials.
[02:21:19.150 --> 02:21:21.411]  Check out the new specials at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:21:21.791 --> 02:21:22.091]  All right.
[02:21:22.312 --> 02:21:24.553]  War Room coming up for Gerald Cilente at 3 p.m.
[02:21:24.573 --> 02:21:25.033]  Central.
[02:21:26.734 --> 02:21:27.715]  Hello, hello.
[02:21:27.915 --> 02:21:31.217]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show on Infowars.
[02:21:32.538 --> 02:21:33.018]  Oh, yeah.
[02:21:33.638 --> 02:21:34.899]  What times we're going through.
[02:21:34.919 --> 02:21:37.741]  I want to start off on the economy.
[02:21:39.107 --> 02:21:40.968]  This thing's going down big time.
[02:21:42.689 --> 02:21:44.651]  That's unprecedented in world history.
[02:21:44.671 --> 02:21:46.592]  I want to get this 100% straight.
[02:21:47.833 --> 02:21:57.099]  You go back to when they first started closing things down, and all you kept hearing from the exploits, they're going to have a V-shaped economy.
[02:21:57.600 --> 02:22:00.201]  It's going to go down, then it's going to go back up again.
[02:22:02.203 --> 02:22:02.963]  Not happening.
[02:22:05.605 --> 02:22:06.606]  You look at the data.
[02:22:08.666 --> 02:22:13.970]  The only thing that's keeping this up is the money that governments are pumping into the system to try to prop it up.
[02:22:15.571 --> 02:22:18.333]  You see where gold prices are going and silver prices?
[02:22:19.574 --> 02:22:22.396]  Oh yeah, they took a hit last week and they bounced back this week.
[02:22:25.458 --> 02:22:26.379]  Look at Bitcoin.
[02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:27.840]  It's now over 12,000.
[02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:32.244]  We've been watching this.
[02:22:35.306 --> 02:22:38.208]  It's been going, as we kept watching it,
[02:22:39.099 --> 02:22:41.960]  It didn't break below like that 7,000 mark.
[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:46.101]  Kept going between six, high sixes, nines, into ten.
[02:22:46.921 --> 02:22:50.222]  So when it breaks out past ten, it's going to start moving really higher.
[02:22:50.242 --> 02:22:53.503]  It shot past ten and now it's at twelve.
[02:22:53.603 --> 02:22:54.003]  Why?
[02:22:55.463 --> 02:23:04.325]  Because people know, that watchinfo was, or subscribe to the Trends Journal, that this is one big fraud.
[02:23:06.326 --> 02:23:07.246]  They're pumping up
[02:23:08.351 --> 02:23:12.813]  Global economies with digital money backed by nothing and printed on nothing.
[02:23:13.313 --> 02:23:14.894]  These are the hard facts.
[02:23:17.175 --> 02:23:23.838]  You're looking at a debt in the United States this year of about $4 trillion, just this year.
[02:23:27.199 --> 02:23:28.660]  The dollar's going down.
[02:23:30.081 --> 02:23:31.401]  Oh, and the euro's going up.
[02:23:31.521 --> 02:23:32.122]  Oh, yeah, great.
[02:23:32.182 --> 02:23:33.822]  Why was the euro going up?
[02:23:34.723 --> 02:23:37.044]  Maybe because they locked down Spain again.
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:45.384]  Oh, in Italy, you can't go to a disco, no more clubs, gotta wear a mask, can't do this, can't do that.
[02:23:48.406 --> 02:24:02.195]  Hey, if you're coming back into Italy and you came from Spain or Croatia or a number of other countries, you gotta get tested.
[02:24:02.955 --> 02:24:05.437]  Oh, if you came in from England, you were in England,
[02:24:06.121 --> 02:24:09.462]  And you were somewhere else and you're going back home, you got to be quarantined.
[02:24:10.822 --> 02:24:24.284]  Here in New York, we got the little boy born on third base, arrogant little nothing of a clown playing dictator of New York, who they all brag about.
[02:24:24.904 --> 02:24:27.545]  There's only about 33,000 deaths in New York.
[02:24:28.705 --> 02:24:31.885]  Yeah, I think that's about all they had in Spain in total.
[02:24:33.366 --> 02:24:35.406]  Yeah, that guy, it's about
[02:24:35.882 --> 02:24:40.204]  Forty states that you can't come from and you have to be quarantined.
[02:24:42.826 --> 02:24:43.486]  Oh, that's great.
[02:24:43.806 --> 02:24:45.287]  New York, New York.
[02:24:45.587 --> 02:24:45.907]  Yeah.
[02:24:47.829 --> 02:25:00.495]  You could take that drink out of that dictator and put another couple of words in there to begin with a I and a C in the middle and take out the tater and put a taster.
[02:25:02.036 --> 02:25:03.157]  Because that's all he is.
[02:25:04.237 --> 02:25:05.238]  Like his little brother.
[02:25:06.443 --> 02:25:12.006]  Another nothing with an attitude that plays reporter on CNN, Cartoon News Network.
[02:25:13.807 --> 02:25:15.087]  Manhattan is dead!
[02:25:16.408 --> 02:25:16.728]  Dead!
[02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:35.398]  The Trends Journal, in early March, we said people would be fleeing major cities because the rising crime and the fear and hysteria that they're promoting
[02:25:37.824 --> 02:25:39.866]  That's going to keep them out of big cities.
[02:25:42.267 --> 02:25:44.269]  Go to New York Times last week.
[02:25:44.729 --> 02:25:46.310]  You know what one of the big stories was?
[02:25:47.291 --> 02:25:48.312]  You know where they're coming to?
[02:25:49.613 --> 02:25:50.654]  Kingston, New York.
[02:25:52.015 --> 02:25:52.635]  Where we are.
[02:25:55.037 --> 02:25:56.218]  Does that make me happy?
[02:25:56.238 --> 02:26:01.002]  Because I have real estate here and I have three of the most historic buildings in America?
[02:26:01.982 --> 02:26:04.224]  On the most precious four corners in America?
[02:26:04.665 --> 02:26:04.905]  No!
[02:26:08.168 --> 02:26:09.689]  Go to Bloomberg last week.
[02:26:13.272 --> 02:26:13.792]  Kingston.
[02:26:15.754 --> 02:26:23.459]  Prices going up faster than any other city of 181 in America.
[02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:25.481]  Does that make me happy?
[02:26:25.821 --> 02:26:26.121]  No.
[02:26:27.362 --> 02:26:36.809]  They're fleeing the city, coming up here all in fear, and walking around everywhere with their masks on, even with nobody in the street.
[02:26:38.035 --> 02:26:40.097]  Driving in cars with their mask on.
[02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:45.463]  They suck the joy out of life, these politicians.
[02:26:45.803 --> 02:26:47.625]  This economy's not coming back.
[02:26:47.665 --> 02:26:52.891]  They destroyed it in ways that are unimaginable.
[02:26:58.894 --> 02:27:07.079]  Look at the numbers back in July with Yelp was at some 53% of the restaurants are going out of business, not coming back.
[02:27:07.139 --> 02:27:07.659]  Now it's up to 60?
[02:27:11.401 --> 02:27:13.062]  Forget about Wall Street.
[02:27:13.682 --> 02:27:14.783]  You don't need it anymore.
[02:27:14.823 --> 02:27:15.363]  It's gone.
[02:27:15.423 --> 02:27:16.524]  It's dead street.
[02:27:17.725 --> 02:27:20.486]  You don't have streets that are closed off or restaurants on both sides.
[02:27:20.666 --> 02:27:21.106]  Empty.
[02:27:23.828 --> 02:27:25.349]  Globally, same thing.
[02:27:27.426 --> 02:27:30.147]  This is going down big, hard and fast.
[02:27:33.409 --> 02:27:35.410]  And I'll tell you when it's really going to collapse.
[02:27:38.592 --> 02:27:39.292]  I believe.
[02:27:41.473 --> 02:27:42.214]  In September.
[02:27:44.235 --> 02:27:44.815]  October.
[02:27:46.076 --> 02:27:46.756]  November.
[02:27:47.857 --> 02:27:48.517]  December.
[02:27:48.777 --> 02:27:49.237]  There it is.
[02:27:49.277 --> 02:27:50.098]  There's Wall Street.
[02:27:50.138 --> 02:27:50.998]  There's no street.
[02:27:51.659 --> 02:27:52.599]  It's empty street.
[02:27:55.489 --> 02:27:57.890]  The city that never sleeps is dead.
[02:27:58.690 --> 02:27:59.031]  Dead.
[02:28:00.451 --> 02:28:01.692]  Everybody's asleep.
[02:28:02.432 --> 02:28:05.213]  There's no neon lights shining on Broadway.
[02:28:05.813 --> 02:28:07.354]  And we don't know when we're going to open up.
[02:28:07.394 --> 02:28:10.655]  If we don't open up, they're only going to allow 25% capacity.
[02:28:11.076 --> 02:28:12.936]  Oh, yeah, you'll make a fortune doing that.
[02:28:13.377 --> 02:28:15.538]  Oh, and that business was tough already.
[02:28:18.139 --> 02:28:20.320]  All along Restaurant Road, dead row.
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:23.361]  And it's all over.
[02:28:24.289 --> 02:28:26.910]  Hey, how about the looting in Chicago in the loop?
[02:28:27.271 --> 02:28:28.531]  Let's loot the loop.
[02:28:29.412 --> 02:28:32.714]  Magnificent mile, not a smile on it.
[02:28:35.215 --> 02:28:36.496]  I warned this would happen.
[02:28:38.197 --> 02:28:41.639]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:28:43.059 --> 02:28:44.980]  And they're losing it big time.
[02:28:45.861 --> 02:28:51.464]  And for any reason they want to give, real, fake, or whatever.
[02:28:54.099 --> 02:28:57.441]  I'm telling you, prepare for the worst.
[02:28:59.142 --> 02:29:00.182]  Prepare for the worst.
[02:29:00.242 --> 02:29:02.143]  If the worst doesn't happen, you've lost nothing.
[02:29:03.924 --> 02:29:08.547]  If the worst happens, which I believe it is, and you haven't prepared, you're going to lose everything.
[02:29:10.528 --> 02:29:12.189]  Guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[02:29:12.209 --> 02:29:16.951]  GCs, 3Gs, plus go to InfoWars.
[02:29:18.372 --> 02:29:22.254]  Get the products you need to prepare to prevail.
[02:29:25.697 --> 02:29:27.938]  Remember when they used to make fun of us preppers?
[02:29:30.820 --> 02:29:33.021]  And now the rich cats are just starting to do it.
[02:29:33.982 --> 02:29:34.522]  Big time.
[02:29:35.283 --> 02:29:36.944]  So now is your time.
[02:29:37.944 --> 02:29:39.525]  Prepare for the worst.
[02:29:40.245 --> 02:29:41.446]  It's right around the corner.
[02:29:42.147 --> 02:29:44.068]  And we'll be back in just a few minutes.
[02:29:45.609 --> 02:29:46.429]  Hello, hello.
[02:29:46.689 --> 02:29:48.910]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:49.931 --> 02:29:53.153]  And as I said, you better prepare for the worst.
[02:29:54.522 --> 02:29:58.683]  And get those products from Infowars that they're getting harder and harder to get.
[02:29:58.703 --> 02:30:02.744]  You know, there's a supply chain shortage of everything.
[02:30:03.185 --> 02:30:04.505]  We're doing some work around here.
[02:30:04.565 --> 02:30:09.346]  We can't get treated lumber, pressure treated lumber.
[02:30:09.987 --> 02:30:12.427]  We're finding having trouble getting electrical supplies.
[02:30:14.168 --> 02:30:21.410]  You know, I thought that we were going to see dragflation, which means that the economy is going to drag down.
[02:30:23.300 --> 02:30:34.789]  Inflation is going to go up, not because of the price of the products going up, but because there's going to be a devaluation of the currency.
[02:30:37.812 --> 02:30:45.357]  But prices are going up now because there's a global shortage of a lot of products because of the lockdowns.
[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:49.741]  So they're going to go up even higher.
[02:30:51.229 --> 02:31:01.095]  And that's why I'm very bullish on gold, and I do not give financial advice, and silver, which I think is going to be like $100 an ounce.
[02:31:03.077 --> 02:31:06.058]  And again, I only put it in the facts.
[02:31:07.399 --> 02:31:13.903]  And the fact is that on InfoWars, and our subscribers well know, last June 19, 2019, June 6 of 2019,
[02:31:18.843 --> 02:31:21.424]  The headline of our trend alert was Gold Bull Run.
[02:31:22.884 --> 02:31:25.645]  And gold was $1,332 an ounce.
[02:31:27.226 --> 02:31:30.767]  As we're speaking now, it's like, what, about, you know, 1970?
[02:31:31.867 --> 02:31:33.548]  You think your subscription was worth it?
[02:31:35.689 --> 02:31:43.611]  Anyway, and then in June, when silver was, you know, $1,750 an ounce.
[02:31:46.592 --> 02:31:48.213]  And he said, it's the beginning of the silver.
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:49.420]  Bull run.
[02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:53.263]  And now Silver's Lot playing around $27, $28 an ounce.
[02:31:55.585 --> 02:31:56.946]  This is just the beginning of it.
[02:31:59.228 --> 02:32:03.471]  I want to talk a little bit about the presidential reality show.
[02:32:05.853 --> 02:32:13.959]  This is from the New York Times, the self-proclaimed paper of record, which I call the toilet paper record.
[02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:16.441]  Harris pick
[02:32:17.737 --> 02:32:20.079]  Indicative of new political calculus.
[02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:25.283]  Okay, get out your calculator and let's do some political calculus.
[02:32:26.364 --> 02:32:31.308]  First, go to Google, and Google up the definition of politician.
[02:32:31.328 --> 02:32:34.971]  Something that would run some political office, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:32:35.912 --> 02:32:42.277]  A person that's manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization.
[02:32:42.297 --> 02:32:45.940]  So that's political calculus.
[02:32:46.716 --> 02:32:53.119]  Manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization.
[02:32:54.059 --> 02:32:54.399]  Got it?
[02:32:57.200 --> 02:33:01.362]  So, Harris pick indicative of new political calculus.
[02:33:01.902 --> 02:33:02.743]  So let's add up.
[02:33:04.483 --> 02:33:09.865]  Gender and race have become more important than delivering home state.
[02:33:11.666 --> 02:33:16.008]  Well, she's in California, and of course, the liberals in California are going to vote for them.
[02:33:16.738 --> 02:33:18.900]  Trump was gonna probably lose that state anyway.
[02:33:20.020 --> 02:33:21.922]  So they're not concerned about that state.
[02:33:22.682 --> 02:33:26.805]  Gender and race have become more important than delivering a home state.
[02:33:26.845 --> 02:33:28.106]  That's political calculus.
[02:33:29.427 --> 02:33:36.612]  I find gender and race becoming more important, both sexist and racist, as an American.
[02:33:37.172 --> 02:33:39.434]  To me, it's not about delivering a state.
[02:33:40.555 --> 02:33:42.096]  I want the best person.
[02:33:43.553 --> 02:33:53.519]  I find that picking someone for gender or race is sexist and racist, according to the facts that are stated right here.
[02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:56.340]  I run a business.
[02:33:58.342 --> 02:34:09.168]  I could care less if they're black, white, green, yellow, transgender, gay, upside down, inside out.
[02:34:09.708 --> 02:34:12.730]  How about the best person to do the job?
[02:34:13.698 --> 02:34:15.959]  Why, how dare you, Selenti?
[02:34:16.459 --> 02:34:18.259]  What kind of moron are you?
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:30.862]  We want someone where gender and race have become more important.
[02:34:31.882 --> 02:34:33.143]  Not my language, theirs.
[02:34:34.323 --> 02:34:35.743]  That's not my America.
[02:34:36.704 --> 02:34:38.984]  My America is land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:34:39.304 --> 02:34:40.464]  And this isn't brave at all.
[02:34:40.504 --> 02:34:42.425]  This is cowardly, disgusting,
[02:34:43.743 --> 02:34:46.885]  Freaks that would do something like this.
[02:34:47.286 --> 02:34:48.647]  How about the best person?
[02:34:50.969 --> 02:34:52.690]  Why, I'm not racist or sexist.
[02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:53.631]  Hey, I'm Italian.
[02:34:54.972 --> 02:34:59.355]  How about that piece of garbage, slimy little crap ball?
[02:35:00.876 --> 02:35:01.276]  Fauci.
[02:35:01.316 --> 02:35:04.459]  Now there's a piece of slime.
[02:35:04.779 --> 02:35:05.760]  He's Italian.
[02:35:07.301 --> 02:35:09.983]  How about King Cuomo over here?
[02:35:11.284 --> 02:35:12.305]  He's Italian.
[02:35:13.354 --> 02:35:15.276]  Not my kind of an Italian!
[02:35:15.296 --> 02:35:17.978]  Italian makes no difference at all!
[02:35:19.279 --> 02:35:21.140]  Unless it's fine Italian food.
[02:35:22.842 --> 02:35:24.823]  And these people are just putting out crap!
[02:35:27.385 --> 02:35:40.356]  So it's not about who I like, or what color my skin is, or whether I'm male, female, transgender, gay, I can care less!
[02:35:41.753 --> 02:35:43.334]  I want the best person.
[02:35:45.535 --> 02:35:46.756]  Sexist and racist.
[02:35:47.936 --> 02:35:49.457]  And they make it clear.
[02:35:49.477 --> 02:35:49.517]  Ms.
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:36:10.187]  Harris, who is half black and half Indian American, is not expected to scramble the electoral map, nor was the former vice president, nor the former vice president leads in polls
[02:36:10.683 --> 02:36:13.965]  Of most of the crucial battlegrounds, so they're not looking hard to do that.
[02:36:14.245 --> 02:36:14.746]  Here they go.
[02:36:15.346 --> 02:36:18.348]  Instead, ever since black voters.
[02:36:20.129 --> 02:36:23.891]  Resurrected his primary candidacy in South Carolina.
[02:36:24.732 --> 02:36:34.578]  Mr Biden in his campaign have made the pursuit of black voters in November, a centerpiece of his bid for the White House.
[02:36:35.398 --> 02:36:36.779]  So that's the centerpiece.
[02:36:37.820 --> 02:36:39.541]  Not getting the best person.
[02:36:42.088 --> 02:36:43.969]  Getting the person who you think could win.
[02:36:47.009 --> 02:36:47.469]  The race.
[02:36:47.569 --> 02:36:48.330]  So here we go.
[02:36:53.191 --> 02:37:06.234]  This is 100 percent a demographic selection, said Theodore R. Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, who studies voting behavior among black voters.
[02:37:08.175 --> 02:37:08.275]  OK.
[02:37:08.991 --> 02:37:12.332]  This is 100% a demographic selection.
[02:37:16.893 --> 02:37:17.653]  And the story.
[02:37:18.893 --> 02:37:21.213]  Not the best selection of the best person.
[02:37:22.694 --> 02:37:24.474]  No, it's a demographic selection.
[02:37:29.715 --> 02:37:35.096]  Robert Shrum, director of Center for Political Future at the University of Southern California.
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:38.061]  So that more than anything, the choice of Ms.
[02:37:38.081 --> 02:37:44.344]  Harris should address one of the reasons Mrs. Clinton lost to Mr. Trump so narrowly in 2016.
[02:37:44.684 --> 02:37:55.068]  One of the problems in 2016 was a fall off of African American votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
[02:37:56.909 --> 02:37:58.910]  That's all it's about.
[02:38:01.772 --> 02:38:09.214]  Hillary Clinton also lost, ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages, because people couldn't stand her.
[02:38:10.474 --> 02:38:11.594]  Look at the facts.
[02:38:11.774 --> 02:38:12.634]  Look at the polls.
[02:38:13.194 --> 02:38:17.315]  Her favorability rating was in the turlet, along with Trump's.
[02:38:18.295 --> 02:38:21.416]  But they had enough of her, so they flushed her down.
[02:38:22.456 --> 02:38:30.898]  Because, if my facts are correct, less women voted for Hillary than they voted for Trump.
[02:38:33.695 --> 02:38:35.676]  So that's what the American election is.
[02:38:36.837 --> 02:38:37.958]  Not who is the best.
[02:38:38.999 --> 02:38:40.720]  Not who could do the best job.
[02:38:43.922 --> 02:38:45.343]  How I can be political.
[02:38:47.044 --> 02:38:53.928]  Manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization.
[02:38:55.770 --> 02:38:56.950]  This is disgusting.
[02:38:58.912 --> 02:39:00.833]  And disgusting people ruling.
[02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:07.391]  Because if that's what's going to be ruining us, we're going down to Turley.
[02:39:09.572 --> 02:39:10.092]  Real bad.
[02:39:10.592 --> 02:39:12.612]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:39:12.972 --> 02:39:15.693]  I love that cover on that Trends Journal over there.
[02:39:16.213 --> 02:39:17.673]  You can put that back for a second.
[02:39:18.114 --> 02:39:20.474]  That's another Anthony Fried, a work of art.
[02:39:21.314 --> 02:39:24.055]  And yeah, junk food.
[02:39:25.635 --> 02:39:26.436]  Junk news.
[02:39:27.476 --> 02:39:28.336]  Junk brains.
[02:39:29.476 --> 02:39:30.356]  And that's what we have.
[02:39:30.396 --> 02:39:32.297]  And that's why you tune into InfoWars.
[02:39:33.117 --> 02:39:42.302]  To get the information that you're not getting on the junk news and the junk brains that's being formed.
[02:39:42.322 --> 02:39:44.223]  And of course, that's why you read the Trends Journal.
[02:39:45.083 --> 02:39:49.406]  So I'm very happy to be on the show to keep the truth alive.
[02:39:49.606 --> 02:39:51.927]  I want to stay on the Kamala Harris thing here a moment.
[02:39:53.428 --> 02:39:57.110]  There's another big story in the toilet paper record last Thursday.
[02:40:00.192 --> 02:40:02.633]  Progressive lose a coveted spot.
[02:40:04.141 --> 02:40:05.882]  But a revolt isn't next.
[02:40:06.923 --> 02:40:09.444]  How about revolting isn't next, because that's who they are.
[02:40:11.285 --> 02:40:24.173]  For the moment Bernie Sanders exited the presidential race in early April, many activists, organizers, progressives, punk groups, and elected officials had held out hope that Joseph R. Biden Jr.
[02:40:25.094 --> 02:40:33.239]  would elevate one of their ideological allies to the vice presidency, someone like
[02:40:34.466 --> 02:40:37.548]  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
[02:40:40.089 --> 02:41:03.381]  So when Biden announced on Thursday that he had selected Miss Harris to serve as running mate, his choice reaffirmed what many progressives had long feared, that any potential Biden administration would govern as the former vice president had spent most of his career, quote, firmly rooted in democratic establishment politics.
[02:41:04.642 --> 02:41:08.524]  Firmly rooted in democratic establishment politics.
[02:41:09.245 --> 02:41:18.310]  Firmly rooted in war and stealing our money and giving it to the bigs.
[02:41:19.310 --> 02:41:26.254]  A warmonger with a track record of there's not one war that I don't love.
[02:41:26.334 --> 02:41:32.938]  Matter of fact, the Wall Street Journal did all the issues of how different
[02:41:33.513 --> 02:41:37.474]  Harris and how the same they were on different issues.
[02:41:37.815 --> 02:41:41.896]  And they listed of health care, immigration, etc.
[02:41:42.816 --> 02:41:44.617]  Now, one thing about foreign policy.
[02:41:45.817 --> 02:41:47.578]  Who cares about foreign policy?
[02:41:48.618 --> 02:41:53.000]  There were six deaths in Florida yesterday.
[02:41:54.140 --> 02:41:54.521]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:54.561 --> 02:42:01.243]  Forget about the 10 million starving in in Yemen, the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth.
[02:42:02.503 --> 02:42:05.185]  Thanks to the United States and its allies.
[02:42:06.205 --> 02:42:12.749]  Forget about the two million people America's killed in Iraq, destroyed the joint, Afghanistan.
[02:42:12.769 --> 02:42:13.950]  I wonder why people are leaving.
[02:42:13.970 --> 02:42:14.870]  They can't figure it out.
[02:42:14.991 --> 02:42:15.511]  Syria.
[02:42:16.051 --> 02:42:28.239]  Oh, that Nobel piece of crap prize winner, that lovely guy that he was vice the vice president was for the vice president under Obama, the Nobel piece of crap prize winner.
[02:42:29.419 --> 02:42:32.141]  But rather than revolt because they're revolting,
[02:42:32.625 --> 02:42:53.175]  Many progressive activists and elected officials, elected official pieces of crap, immediately snuffed out their criticism and instead proclaimed their support, applauding the selection and reiterating that removing President Trump from office was their electoral priority.
[02:42:53.596 --> 02:42:57.277]  Not getting the best person, that's their only priority.
[02:42:58.078 --> 02:43:00.099]  Quote,
[02:43:01.624 --> 02:43:20.055]  At the end of the day, this isn't some Democratic decision, said Evan Weber, the political director of Sunrise Movement, about Sunset Movement, the advocacy group which endorsed Mr. Sanders in the primary.
[02:43:20.915 --> 02:43:27.019]  This was always going to be a decision that was up to the vice president
[02:43:28.939 --> 02:43:31.260]  And a personal one of his.
[02:43:34.622 --> 02:43:38.623]  Larry Cohen, chairman of Sanders aligned group Our Revolution.
[02:43:40.744 --> 02:43:50.409]  Said she's not Warren or Bass in terms of her background, but I don't think it makes sense for us to criticize the reality.
[02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:56.992]  So you're not allowed to criticize the reality of who Harris is.
[02:43:57.685 --> 02:44:00.166]  And how she got her way to the top.
[02:44:01.247 --> 02:44:02.748]  That's another story.
[02:44:03.568 --> 02:44:06.450]  But it's all there for everybody to read.
[02:44:07.251 --> 02:44:08.671]  Yeah, read all about it.
[02:44:11.933 --> 02:44:15.836]  Goes on to say that another one.
[02:44:18.177 --> 02:44:24.621]  But while many groups and officials tended to toe the party line, others spoke more cautiously of their support.
[02:44:26.121 --> 02:44:26.822]  Cori Bush,
[02:44:27.816 --> 02:44:37.039]  A progressive activist, who will almost certainly head to Congress after unseating House member in the Democratic primary this month in St.
[02:44:37.079 --> 02:44:42.181]  Louis, said she was, quote, torn, end quote, about the selection of Ms.
[02:44:42.201 --> 02:44:47.423]  Harris, quote, I'm not going to tear down another woman of color.
[02:44:49.604 --> 02:44:49.704]  Oh.
[02:44:51.365 --> 02:44:51.505]  Oh.
[02:44:52.925 --> 02:44:54.686]  Then you're racist and sexist.
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:03.885]  Would you tear down a man, not your color, if you wanted to tear that person down?
[02:45:06.427 --> 02:45:08.689]  This is sexist and racist, Miss Bush.
[02:45:11.050 --> 02:45:19.516]  You will not tear down another woman of color.
[02:45:24.860 --> 02:45:26.001]  But as a progressive,
[02:45:27.062 --> 02:45:30.264]  She goes on to say, I have to stand with my progressive values.
[02:45:31.264 --> 02:45:32.585]  Well, I would suggest, Ms.
[02:45:32.625 --> 02:45:42.570]  Bush, you're a hypocrite, because there's not one thing progressive about the track records of either the people that you are supporting.
[02:45:45.591 --> 02:45:46.292]  Progressive?
[02:45:47.532 --> 02:45:49.694]  We think very differently.
[02:45:51.775 --> 02:45:52.395]  Progressive?
[02:45:54.836 --> 02:45:56.197]  Progressively descending.
[02:45:59.246 --> 02:45:59.926]  Going on.
[02:46:01.727 --> 02:46:03.867]  Among liberals, the acceptance of Ms.
[02:46:03.887 --> 02:46:11.669]  Harris, if reluctant, if reluctant, still amounted to a surprising about face.
[02:46:13.109 --> 02:46:19.791]  After months of lobbying for her more progressive rivals, rivals to appear on the ticket.
[02:46:22.352 --> 02:46:23.152]  If reluctant.
[02:46:24.752 --> 02:46:25.432]  How about.
[02:46:27.133 --> 02:46:28.273]  If you're a coward.
[02:46:30.816 --> 02:46:31.737]  How about that?
[02:46:34.639 --> 02:46:37.080]  Reluctant cowards.
[02:46:38.501 --> 02:46:39.962]  And that's all this has become.
[02:46:42.464 --> 02:46:43.244]  A freak show.
[02:46:45.646 --> 02:46:46.706]  Facts don't matter.
[02:46:48.307 --> 02:46:48.908]  Ah, here it is.
[02:46:51.049 --> 02:46:56.213]  Running mates differed on some policy stances.
[02:46:57.173 --> 02:46:58.094]  But Wall Street Journal
[02:47:00.376 --> 02:47:01.076]  August 13th.
[02:47:02.456 --> 02:47:03.417]  Energy and climate.
[02:47:03.477 --> 02:47:03.897]  Trade.
[02:47:04.437 --> 02:47:04.997]  Health care.
[02:47:05.537 --> 02:47:06.497]  Guaranteed income.
[02:47:06.837 --> 02:47:07.437]  Immigration.
[02:47:07.497 --> 02:47:08.058]  Taxes.
[02:47:08.238 --> 02:47:08.678]  That's it.
[02:47:09.658 --> 02:47:11.698]  Nothing about foreign policy.
[02:47:12.699 --> 02:47:14.239]  Zero, nada, nothing.
[02:47:16.079 --> 02:47:18.220]  Oh, what do you care about foreign policy, Salenti?
[02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:24.481]  Just because you launched Occupy Peace and you're disgusted with the wars that
[02:47:25.439 --> 02:47:28.301]  Murderer Biden supported so much of?
[02:47:28.842 --> 02:47:31.844]  And the Nobel Piece of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama?
[02:47:32.344 --> 02:47:32.965]  Obama!
[02:47:33.525 --> 02:47:36.207]  Oh, B-O-M-B-A, Obama!
[02:47:36.728 --> 02:47:39.950]  I want that guy shot outta there!
[02:47:42.152 --> 02:47:45.734]  I want that guy, uh, Qaddafi outta there!
[02:47:46.455 --> 02:47:48.056]  I don't care who you kill!
[02:47:48.836 --> 02:47:51.258]  I don't care what country you destroy!
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:53.460]  Kill him!
[02:47:54.144 --> 02:47:55.105]  Destroy him!
[02:47:55.745 --> 02:47:56.766]  I want him out of there!
[02:47:57.066 --> 02:47:59.168]  Oh, Selenti, calm down.
[02:47:59.629 --> 02:48:00.990]  He's a progressive.
[02:48:01.390 --> 02:48:04.392]  The liberals love Obama.
[02:48:05.113 --> 02:48:07.215]  They love Biden.
[02:48:10.738 --> 02:48:11.318]  Look at this.
[02:48:12.679 --> 02:48:14.020]  There's no two parties.
[02:48:16.863 --> 02:48:17.743]  It's a joke.
[02:48:19.205 --> 02:48:19.985]  Progressives.
[02:48:20.706 --> 02:48:22.107]  I'll tell you, this is the best time
[02:48:22.765 --> 02:48:27.028]  The best time I've seen for third party, I could give you two quick platforms.
[02:48:27.848 --> 02:48:30.450]  One, no vaccine for me.
[02:48:31.571 --> 02:48:32.952]  No mask for me.
[02:48:33.572 --> 02:48:35.934]  Only by the facts, Jack and Jill.
[02:48:36.634 --> 02:48:39.756]  And I want my taxes cut big time.
[02:48:40.657 --> 02:48:43.419]  Closing down all those schools and going online.
[02:48:44.179 --> 02:48:47.001]  Don't need those janitors, those people serving lunch.
[02:48:47.402 --> 02:48:50.724]  No more teachers, only need one for the first, second, all the grades.
[02:48:52.987 --> 02:48:54.128]  Time for a new party.
[02:48:55.508 --> 02:48:56.209]  The other two?
[02:48:56.969 --> 02:48:58.010]  They don't do it for me.
[02:48:59.430 --> 02:49:00.511]  Not by a long shot.
[02:49:01.251 --> 02:49:02.032]  Trump and Biden?
[02:49:02.232 --> 02:49:03.292]  That's a different issue.
[02:49:04.033 --> 02:49:05.473]  But the two political parties?
[02:49:07.674 --> 02:49:11.897]  The dumbo craps and the repulsive kins.
[02:49:14.218 --> 02:49:15.618]  You like Lindsey Graham?
[02:49:15.719 --> 02:49:17.599]  No, maybe Mitch McConnell's your guy.
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:20.801]  Nah, Nancy Pelosi's for me, you little Chuckie Schumer.
[02:49:21.742 --> 02:49:22.542]  We need a change.
[02:49:23.171 --> 02:49:24.114]  Thanks for tuning in.
[02:49:24.476 --> 02:49:25.720]  This is Gerald Cilenti.
[02:49:26.423 --> 02:49:27.206]  See you next week.
[02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:42.543]  Just a few months ago, almost every storable food manufacturer was sold out.
[02:49:43.084 --> 02:49:46.426]  They were still taking people's orders, and many of the companies have still not fulfilled them.
[02:49:46.887 --> 02:49:48.628]  All the orders we got in have been fulfilled.
[02:49:48.948 --> 02:49:55.194]  Our supplier's the best, the highest quality, the best containers to transport it as well, and they've got the food with four factories in stock.
[02:49:55.474 --> 02:49:57.716]  Takes them two to four weeks to get it shipped out to you.
[02:49:58.116 --> 02:49:59.877]  You need to order your storable food now.
[02:50:00.218 --> 02:50:01.639]  The world is much more dire.
[02:50:01.839 --> 02:50:03.580]  The economic system is collapsing.
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:05.082]  The third world's already starving to death.
[02:50:05.342 --> 02:50:06.643]  Food prices are exploding here.
[02:50:07.362 --> 02:50:11.324]  Uh, the farms and the production plants are shutting down because of the COVID hoax.
[02:50:11.644 --> 02:50:14.946]  You need to get your storable food while you still can at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:50:14.966 --> 02:50:15.746]  It's a 360 win.
[02:50:16.026 --> 02:50:17.267]  It also funds our operation.
[02:50:17.547 --> 02:50:19.908]  But you need to get it, whether it's three months, six months, a year.
[02:50:20.209 --> 02:50:24.711]  You need to get that now and have that checkbox off of being prepared and being self-sufficient.
[02:50:24.731 --> 02:50:28.433]  We also have high quality water filtration and air filtration at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:50:28.473 --> 02:50:29.273]  They're an absolute must.
[02:50:29.293 --> 02:50:33.255]  But whatever you do, ladies and gentlemen, don't wait until a bigger crisis comes.
[02:50:33.695 --> 02:50:35.336]  Don't wait till everybody panics.
[02:50:35.576 --> 02:50:36.017]  Take action.
[02:50:36.037 --> 02:50:36.497]  Get ready now.
[02:50:38.499 --> 02:50:49.151]  Owen Schroyer here, host of the InfoWars War Room, every day from 3 to 6 p.m., and that means I have to follow up after the big man, and that is not an easy task.
[02:50:49.251 --> 02:50:54.376]  So I need to be as focused and energized as possible every day at 3 o'clock.
[02:50:54.516 --> 02:50:54.937]  So yes,
[02:50:55.237 --> 02:50:57.898]  I am on performance enhancing drugs.
[02:50:58.379 --> 02:51:20.869]  It's the combination of the energy of the turbo force, the focus of the brain force, and then the VasoBeat Complete, which is a beet supplement, which act as a vasodilator, which makes sure that the nutrients and supplements that you're intaking are getting all throughout the body so that I can maintain proper focus and energy for three hours and beyond.
[02:51:21.069 --> 02:51:22.350]  It's almost three o'clock.
[02:51:22.570 --> 02:51:29.014]  That means it's time to take my performance enhancers that I have conveniently stashed right here at my desk.
[02:51:29.134 --> 02:51:32.977]  I literally will never host a war room without them.
[02:51:33.157 --> 02:51:36.719]  It starts with the Turbo Force right here.
[02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:38.200]  Just get your cup of water.
[02:51:38.641 --> 02:51:40.282]  Pour in the Turbo Force.
[02:51:40.522 --> 02:51:43.144]  I then take my Vezo Beat Complete right here.
[02:51:43.984 --> 02:51:44.585]  One dropper.
[02:51:45.565 --> 02:51:46.226]  Two droppers.
[02:51:46.946 --> 02:51:49.048]  Stir it up just a little bit for good measure.
[02:51:50.666 --> 02:52:08.568]  And then, with the energy from the TurboForce and the nitrates in the VesoBeat Complete, with the Focus from BrainForce, with the Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and all the other supplements that are inside of that, those are the supplements I take.
[02:52:09.634 --> 02:52:16.075]  Every day, right before I go on air, for maximum performance, maximum focus, maximum energy.
[02:52:16.495 --> 02:52:29.318]  And the good news is, once I finish drinking this TurboForce, I've got energy for about 10 hours, so I can continue working past the show, work on other things, go and lift weights, run, whatever I need or want to do.
[02:52:29.518 --> 02:52:37.520]  It's all with the TurboForce, the BrainForce, and the Vezo BeatComplete Trifecta, available only at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:52:38.695 --> 02:52:43.040]  I've talked to the EMS, and I've talked to medical doctors, and what makes you nauseated, it's not just the smell of piss.
[02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:46.624]  What we call the smell of bum piss, it has this sweet, nauseating smell.
[02:52:46.684 --> 02:52:47.706]  Excuse my face.
[02:52:47.786 --> 02:52:52.071]  All it does, it's a sweet, it's a sweet stench that makes you want to throw up like rotten meat.
[02:52:52.151 --> 02:52:53.953]  It is, it is the crap of dust mites.
[02:52:54.349 --> 02:52:58.471]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist-run neighborhoods?
[02:52:58.851 --> 02:53:05.395]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing, and InfoWars Store has the solution.
[02:53:05.615 --> 02:53:18.042]  InfoWars has created the most powerful herbal lung cleanse and respiratory support product on the market, with over a thousand types of mold and mildew, toxic chemicals, and yes, dust mites.

[02:53:38.613 --> 02:53:42.995]  Four years ago, I added a member to the Infowars Life team who has developed
[02:53:46.556 --> 02:53:48.356]  We believe it is the strongest in the market.
[02:53:48.376 --> 02:53:50.757]  If somebody else has got one, we don't know about it.
[02:54:13.402 --> 02:54:14.983]  Now, folks absolutely love it.
[02:54:15.023 --> 02:54:16.805]  They love the results that they get from it.
[02:54:17.585 --> 02:54:20.147]  Now, this is apples and oranges because it complements bodies.
[02:54:20.688 --> 02:54:26.092]  But, going back over seven years ago, we had a major supplier of high-quality, organic turmeric that was liquid.
[02:54:26.152 --> 02:54:26.913]  You take it into the tongue.
[02:54:27.273 --> 02:54:28.013]  And people loved it.
[02:54:28.354 --> 02:54:33.538]  Then we could no longer get any more because that company was so overloaded with orders from other people.
[02:54:33.658 --> 02:54:36.180]  Because getting high-quality turmeric is really a tough thing to do.
[02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:42.569]  We've now secured another company in the last year that has even higher quality turmeric concentrate.
[02:54:42.609 --> 02:54:46.014]  This is one ingredient, pure turmeric extract.
[02:54:46.295 --> 02:54:48.278]  It's the liquid type, taken out of the tongue.
[02:54:48.378 --> 02:54:51.603]  If you love bodies, I think you're really going to love this product.
[02:54:52.003 --> 02:54:54.484]  Some people around the office that have tried it say it's better than bodies.
[02:54:54.784 --> 02:54:55.524]  Some say it's not.
[02:54:55.584 --> 02:54:56.744]  Some say it supercharges it.
[02:54:57.184 --> 02:55:06.687]  All I know is this is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, turmeric extracts under the tongue you can find out there and it's got a different delivery system.
[02:55:07.007 --> 02:55:14.029]  All I know is this is one of the strongest turmeric concentrates that's liquid that you take under the tongue that you're going to find out there and that
