[00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:05.647]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:13.973]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.896]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:18.397]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:20.638]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.301]  This is all confirmed.
[00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:25.262]  This is not a drill.
[00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:29.365]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:31.106]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:31.687]  Apple 100%.
[00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:37.751]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:42.915]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:44.116]  This is happening.
[00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:52.082]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:58.087]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:00:58.507 --> 00:01:07.250]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.891]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:01:11.192 --> 00:01:14.333]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:18.075]  A megaton hits us of the total takeover.
[00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:21.677]  We try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:24.599]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.883]  Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control system.
[00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:32.865]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system.
[00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:45.899]  Now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program, and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai Com slash Big Tech hanging combine emergency situation.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.366]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:01:52.466 --> 00:02:01.191]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:06.073]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:11.376]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:19.402]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:26.668]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:02:26.768 --> 00:02:32.473]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:02:32.693 --> 00:02:37.157]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:02:37.277 --> 00:02:39.519]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.559]  Now break free!
[00:02:42.703 --> 00:02:52.956]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:54.778]  Thomas Jefferson
[00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:03.074]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.654 --> 00:03:15.482]  You know, whenever I get attacked by the enemy, tears start flowing out my eyes.
[00:03:16.402 --> 00:03:19.024]  It's not because the enemy is attacking.
[00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:26.740]  When the enemy comes in, like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord raises up a standard against it.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.081]  And the Holy Spirit gets so strong.
[00:03:32.543 --> 00:03:34.283]  Stars are bright at night.
[00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:36.044]  So are our souls.
[00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:36.204]  Yes.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.320]  So, it's a great time to be alive right now.
[00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:55.061]  And there have been a lot of bad people.
[00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:56.942]  Involved a lot of bad things.
[00:03:57.002 --> 00:04:01.083]  But we are live at 7.03 Central Standard Time.
[00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:07.945]  In literal defiance to the Rockefeller Combine and all their trillions of stolen dollars.
[00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:10.385]  And to the Rothschilds and all their stolen wealth.
[00:04:11.086 --> 00:04:13.746]  And to the entire Chicom Solar System.
[00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:16.867]  And the fact that we live in a solar system.
[00:04:17.427 --> 00:04:19.268]  And they have their Solus System.
[00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:26.400]  The fact that we're here alive is amazing.
[00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:40.711]  And the fact that they would try these moves as a test to see, you can sell out to the New World Order, your children will be dead.
[00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:45.374]  They might live another year, another 10 years, their souls are gone.
[00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:48.797]  There's no making a deal with Satan.
[00:04:58.274 --> 00:05:10.998]  Jeffrey Epstein's triple agent, MI6 Mossad CIA, sex operative, is in a federal jail.
[00:05:11.018 --> 00:05:18.140]  And the enemy, he's now feeling the fire of truth.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.921]  That's a good thing.
[00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:27.803]  But we should expect
[00:05:29.636 --> 00:05:30.877]  The enemy's counter-strike.
[00:05:32.258 --> 00:05:37.260]  And we should accept it like Christ being beaten with cat and eye tails.
[00:05:41.263 --> 00:05:45.005]  Because there is no victory without sacrifice.
[00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:51.489]  There is no defeat of Satan without payment to be made.
[00:05:53.752 --> 00:06:03.139]  And I feel guilty in moments like this, while my family is being persecuted for what I've done, that I am in ecstasy next to Christ.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.845]  If anything, I am guilty that I am in such a high tower of pleasure during this moment.
[00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:23.433]  They're all gonna drown in lakes of blood.
[00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:42.600]  Because there is a creator of this universe that's in power, and that wants justice, that gave us all the green fields, and all the pretty flowers, and all the puppy dogs, and the blue skies, and the moon to look at at night, the sun to see in the day.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.845]  And God will not be mocked.
[00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:57.911]  And in their folly, they have chosen to wage war against God, and that is why they will burn.
[00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:01.355]  In their own inequity.
[00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:04.237]  In their own private hell.
[00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:14.967]  You know, I didn't get to the news I wanted to cover today on the 4-Hour Radio Show, so I thought, hey, the crew's great, they'll come in at night, I'm gonna cover all this big news.
[00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:21.215]  Just hundreds of articles, mainstream news, like, hey, COVID's a fraud!
[00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:22.576]  Hey, it's all a lie!
[00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.079]  What is even the point of that?
[00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:34.804]  There are people that want to believe the lie, or there are people that want to believe the truth.
[00:07:35.624 --> 00:07:36.725]  You should talk about that.
[00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:45.511]  Imagine being told in court, hypothetically, I'm taking your children away from you.
[00:07:46.618 --> 00:07:56.244]  Because you demonstrated in Austin, Texas against the mass of the COVID-19 lockdown when there wasn't even a law.
[00:07:57.705 --> 00:08:07.972]  And I didn't have a law to do it, but because I'm a judge, I'm gonna take your children from you because you protested.
[00:08:11.514 --> 00:08:13.195]  I'm gonna take your birthright.
[00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:16.117]  I'm gonna take everything you've got
[00:08:17.517 --> 00:08:18.238]  Your whole future.
[00:08:18.558 --> 00:08:22.881]  And you know, that doesn't scare me because that's what your whole new world order is, is to take my future.
[00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:26.163]  What, you didn't think I knew you wanted my children?
[00:08:26.183 --> 00:08:33.809]  I already committed that they were burned to fight you.
[00:08:38.573 --> 00:08:42.856]  You think I'll give up?
[00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:45.658]  Because you're gonna attack my children?
[00:08:51.513 --> 00:08:54.574]  The whole point is, you want to rape and kill children?
[00:08:56.916 --> 00:08:59.617]  You know, it just seems to never end.
[00:09:01.398 --> 00:09:02.078]  How they'll threat?
[00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:04.759]  They'll threat to kill me or other people?
[00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:06.380]  I will kill you!
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.241]  You'll kill me!
[00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:11.903]  You'll kill my soul if I join you!
[00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:13.924]  You don't think I know who you are?
[00:09:17.525 --> 00:09:19.026]  That's the biggest joke about it all.
[00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:25.438]  It's the people that sit in offices of power are not powerful.
[00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:28.259]  They are servants of Satan.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.060]  They are frauds.
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.120]  They are jokes.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.501]  They have no redeeming qualities.
[00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:35.682]  They have no respect in God's eyes.
[00:09:37.663 --> 00:09:41.164]  So I will warn all of you watching and all of you listening.
[00:09:42.284 --> 00:09:44.245]  We have committed crimes against God.
[00:09:44.265 --> 00:09:46.746]  We have committed crimes against the children.
[00:09:47.206 --> 00:09:48.306]  We are going to be judged.
[00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:50.767]  This planet is going to be burned to a crisp.
[00:09:52.042 --> 00:09:53.783]  You better get right with God now.
[00:09:54.203 --> 00:10:00.986]  And you better start fearing the engineer that built the universe instead of bowing down to these midget demons.
[00:10:01.786 --> 00:10:02.566]  You have been warned.
[00:10:06.328 --> 00:10:08.729]  I don't sacrifice my children to the fight against the New World Order.
[00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.251]  Because those children didn't belong to me to begin with.
[00:10:14.271 --> 00:10:15.051]  They belong to God.
[00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.974]  And so, you want to destroy my children?
[00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:23.709]  Destroy God's children.
[00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.832]  Because God has a promise to those of you that do that.
[00:10:30.592 --> 00:10:31.573]  Suffer the children.
[00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:38.737]  It's better you tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself in the deepest part of the ocean than to harm one of my children.
[00:10:39.257 --> 00:10:43.759]  And it's not some talk, it's not some game with us, nothing.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.341]  It's vision.
[00:10:51.912 --> 00:10:53.353]  My children have souls.
[00:10:55.114 --> 00:11:00.636]  They were created by God Almighty to have free will.
[00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:06.319]  And if they have to be destroyed,
[00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:13.251]  And if they have to be tortured for the path to destroy the New World Order, that will happen.
[00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:17.213]  That's part of the road that's laid down by God.
[00:11:17.933 --> 00:11:21.856]  Not by some Satanist that tries to torture us into fear.
[00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:24.778]  I break the bonds of fear.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.161]  And I commit myself in the hands of the Almighty.
[00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:36.925]  And I will tell you, my friends, this is an interdimensional attack on our planet.
[00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:42.665]  This is an interdimensional attack on our people of every race, color, and creed to bleed red blood.
[00:11:43.226 --> 00:11:51.071]  And the enemy will not prevail, and the enemy will be broken in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[00:11:51.432 --> 00:11:58.857]  And they cannot stand that deed of power over this creation of the universe.
[00:12:00.558 --> 00:12:05.042]  And they hate it from before the times they were born.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.025]  Now that said, we can talk about the news and it's here.
[00:12:18.411 --> 00:12:25.759]  I was told by individuals involved in a lot of things, the governor Abbott was bad.
[00:12:32.742 --> 00:12:36.345]  But I chose to say, oh, he's pro-gun, he's pro-Texas.
[00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:38.707]  This tree fell on him while he was walking down the street.
[00:12:38.747 --> 00:12:39.188]  Yeah, right.
[00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:50.738]  But now, he is in the news saying you will wear a mask when you leave your house or we'll arrest you.
[00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:59.885]  And behind that is this whole trail of admissions that
[00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.554]  It's not causing COVID-19, the masks don't work, all of it's a fraud.
[00:13:05.614 --> 00:13:06.495]  He doesn't care.
[00:13:07.396 --> 00:13:13.361]  Because he sees the big power of the media and the whole system and he bows down before it.
[00:13:13.842 --> 00:13:15.523]  So let's just move on from Governor Abbott.
[00:13:16.404 --> 00:13:18.366]  Don't put your faith in men, as God tells us.
[00:13:19.047 --> 00:13:20.067]  Like, what is that Bible verse?
[00:13:20.087 --> 00:13:21.689]  Don't put your faith in men, put it in God.
[00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:23.891]  But it is truly disgusting.
[00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:46.449]  Because we have the medical reports from the CDC itself, and it's coming out that they count people that didn't die of COVID-19 as COVID-19, and they count somebody that has the sniffles as COVID-19, and then 15 people around them as COVID-19.
[00:13:46.849 --> 00:13:53.715]  This is the biggest fraud I've ever heard about, dreamed about, thought about, imagined.
[00:13:54.555 --> 00:13:57.578]  But it's all the big corporations
[00:13:58.834 --> 00:14:05.578]  And all the Kingsmen, but they can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:07.199]  So here it is.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.220]  Gateway Punishing, a great job.
[00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:13.543]  You know, we did our own videos on this, showing you state documents, federal documents.
[00:14:14.043 --> 00:14:15.564]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:14:18.446 --> 00:14:20.968]  Huge, massive CDC fraud uncovered.
[00:14:21.008 --> 00:14:22.549]  CDC grossly overcounting.
[00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:30.405]  Active China coronavirus cases causing states to keep their economies closed indefinitely.
[00:14:31.386 --> 00:14:32.788]  And then it goes over all the numbers.
[00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:35.110]  Here's another one.
[00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:42.757]  Now even common cold is being counted as a positive COVID-19 result, says the CDC.
[00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:47.048]  Here's the Atlantic, that's the CIA.
[00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:50.912]  How could the CDC make that mistake?
[00:14:51.512 --> 00:15:01.723]  Count everybody with a antibody test, that means you've already gotten over it, and people that don't have it as the test.
[00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:04.406]  Now why would they put that out?
[00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.268]  Because it's so dumb, they're covering their ass right there.
[00:15:10.874 --> 00:15:16.077]  Oh, but don't worry, new study says Black Lives Matter protests slowed the spread.
[00:15:17.297 --> 00:15:19.478]  They probably actually did by creating antibodies.
[00:15:21.099 --> 00:15:38.628]  But don't worry, this little feller, this guy, Billy Gates, he says get ready for a bunch of other catastrophes to come.
[00:15:39.844 --> 00:15:42.465]  He just says the flu now is going to be a good day.
[00:15:42.505 --> 00:15:44.666]  Well, it is because people die every year.
[00:15:45.126 --> 00:15:54.489]  So now, now he's going to tell you all about how to be a good boy.
[00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:57.550]  He's in charge.
[00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:00.431]  It's okay.
[00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:03.492]  Chinese owned Reddit is under criminal investigation.
[00:16:05.043 --> 00:16:13.046]  But the globalists think they're going to win, but as they get scarier and scarier and realize they're not going to win, they get wilder.
[00:16:13.867 --> 00:16:21.890]  And letting them get all crazy like this, and letting them tell all their millions they better take action and do all this, isn't working anymore, is it?
[00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.271]  So they don't know what to do.
[00:16:25.231 --> 00:16:29.653]  So they double down, and they triple down, and they get even more well done.
[00:16:31.061 --> 00:16:36.706]  So USC's record 52,000 new virus cases in 24 hours.
[00:16:36.846 --> 00:16:37.887]  John Hopkins.
[00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.733]  John Hopkins is run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:16:43.813 --> 00:16:48.877]  They did event 201 in October and November of last year, 2019.
[00:16:49.738 --> 00:16:55.904]  And they're the ones that set up the parameters for this giant fraud.
[00:17:03.353 --> 00:17:04.433]  But let me do this right now.
[00:17:05.354 --> 00:17:26.579]  We have Jeffrey Epstein's triple agent sex operative, Ghislaine Maxwell, arrested early this morning in New Hampshire and now tried in the court of public opinion as, oh, maybe she's involved in some type of pedophilia.
[00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:29.440]  No, I mean, she's involved in massive trafficking.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.000]  All the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:32.341]  So let's go ahead
[00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:37.981]  And play part of the press conference where the U.S.
[00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:39.362]  prosecutors, the U.S.
[00:17:39.402 --> 00:17:40.883]  attorneys, bring this up.
[00:17:40.923 --> 00:17:41.363]  Here it is.
[00:17:42.204 --> 00:17:47.628]  The grooming process left the minor victim susceptible to sexual abuse.
[00:17:50.149 --> 00:17:58.616]  That abuse included sexualized massages during which the minor victim was fully or partially nude.
[00:17:59.923 --> 00:18:08.572]  These sexualized misogynists developed into sexual encounters, for which Maxwell, in some instances, was present and participated.
[00:18:10.154 --> 00:18:17.181]  Maxwell and Epstein worked together to entice these minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences.
[00:18:18.072 --> 00:18:21.374]  Depicted on the other chart at the front of the room.
[00:18:21.394 --> 00:18:22.835]  They're so scared.
[00:18:23.095 --> 00:18:31.379]  His residence in New York City, on the Upper East Side, as well as Palm Beach, Florida and Santa Fe, New Mexico.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:38.483]  Some of the acts of abuse also took place in Maxwell's residence in London, England.
[00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:56.329]  In addition to allegedly enabling and participating in the sexual abuse of young victims, Maxwell compounded her crimes by repeatedly lying in 2016 when she was questioned under oath.
[00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.431]  And we have charged those lies in two perjury counts.
[00:19:03.472 --> 00:19:10.474]  Maxwell lied because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable.
[00:19:10.714 --> 00:19:10.994]  Yeah.
[00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:21.376]  Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, then delivered them into the trap that she and Epstein had set for them.
[00:19:21.636 --> 00:19:22.657]  So they stole innocence!
[00:19:22.677 --> 00:19:24.198]  They pretended to be a woman they could trust.
[00:19:24.218 --> 00:19:24.818]  Like Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:27.580]  All the while... Your whole religion, you filth!
[00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:32.684]  ...to be sexually abused by Epstein, and in some cases, by Maxwell.
[00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:33.845]  I'm glad the gloves are off, actually.
[00:19:35.225 --> 00:19:37.367]  I'm gonna tear the living hell out of you now.
[00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:40.429]  Delaine Maxwell finally stands charged.
[00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.652]  For her role in these crimes.
[00:19:48.316 --> 00:19:58.404]  These charges we announced today are the latest result of our investigation into Epstein and the people around him who facilitated his abuse of minor victims.
[00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:01.347]  That investigation remains ongoing.
[00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:15.281]  My office and the FBI remain committed to doing all within our ability to bring justice to individuals who enabled, facilitated, and participated in the acts of abuse.
[00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:20.783]  Combating the exploitation of children is a priority of our office.
[00:20:21.464 --> 00:20:25.906]  We are committed to pursuing and prosecuting those who exploit and abuse minors.
[00:20:28.007 --> 00:20:30.548]  So, how does
[00:20:31.735 --> 00:20:44.026]  Facebook and Twitter and Google and Apple feel after literally waging a war for the last couple years to suppress our exposure of this.
[00:20:49.431 --> 00:20:53.794]  It's not some high horse thing like, oh I exposed the pedophile rings, you didn't.
[00:20:54.395 --> 00:20:55.596]  It really upsets me.
[00:20:56.477 --> 00:20:57.398]  I lose sleep at night.
[00:20:58.251 --> 00:21:05.978]  Thinking that all big tech still works to block even mainstream news links to this, because it's their religion is screwing children.
[00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:09.001]  I just can't imagine that.
[00:21:11.002 --> 00:21:20.651]  I can't wrap my mind around, because I'm married, my wife's amazing, but I mean, I'm thinking about the juiciest, biggest, most powerful woman
[00:21:23.746 --> 00:21:24.146]  We're good to go.
[00:21:47.796 --> 00:21:57.960]  You know what Adam, I mean, but you know, that's the problem is that those of us that aren't like Joe Biden or Brian Stelter, not saying he's a pedophile, just looks like one.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.661]  Those of us that aren't like that, we're just like, what?
[00:22:02.062 --> 00:22:03.202]  We want to take care of children.
[00:22:03.602 --> 00:22:06.283]  They want to rob children of their future.
[00:22:06.723 --> 00:22:08.144]  You want to build a child up?
[00:22:09.565 --> 00:22:10.586]  Like a missile gantry?
[00:22:11.046 --> 00:22:11.907]  That's your instincts?
[00:22:11.947 --> 00:22:13.608]  Like, empower a child.
[00:22:13.649 --> 00:22:17.452]  They could be black, they could be brown, they could be pink, they could be white.
[00:22:17.932 --> 00:22:19.674]  There's really not any white people who are pink.
[00:22:20.034 --> 00:22:22.937]  They could be pink, brown, yellow, whatever.
[00:22:23.397 --> 00:22:28.201]  The point is, is that you gotta grow up.
[00:22:28.281 --> 00:22:29.002]  I gotta grow up.
[00:22:30.203 --> 00:22:30.763]  And just go.
[00:22:30.823 --> 00:22:33.085]  No, there are people who like to hurt little kids.
[00:22:34.406 --> 00:22:37.129]  And then you gotta ask yourself, what are you gonna do about it?
[00:22:39.377 --> 00:22:40.258]  What are you gonna do about it?
[00:22:45.101 --> 00:22:47.023]  Well, you gotta start exposing.
[00:22:50.425 --> 00:23:01.834]  So, tonight we sit here and we watch one of the main operatives of the Spider Network being arrested.
[00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:05.677]  And believe me, the Deep State wanted this to go away.
[00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:08.619]  This is a big, positive movement.
[00:23:09.514 --> 00:23:11.894]  This is a positive thing that's happening right now.
[00:23:14.795 --> 00:23:16.595]  Founder Epstein's Madam Arrested.
[00:23:17.215 --> 00:23:18.196]  Boston, New Hampshire.
[00:23:18.836 --> 00:23:20.256]  Sex Trafficking Probe.
[00:23:21.076 --> 00:23:22.056]  Read the indictment.
[00:23:22.116 --> 00:23:24.037]  Powerful men scared.
[00:23:26.397 --> 00:23:27.177]  They should be scared.
[00:23:31.718 --> 00:23:35.259]  What they count on is all those other men and women below them.
[00:23:36.144 --> 00:23:40.065]  And it's at that point that you have to pull back and ask yourself, who are these people?
[00:24:01.229 --> 00:24:03.490]  And why do they want to undermine the Republic?
[00:24:03.991 --> 00:24:05.332]  Why do they want to put it down?
[00:24:05.432 --> 00:24:14.677]  Because it's the essence of the Republic and the Renaissance that threatens their system that they want to get rid of.
[00:24:14.938 --> 00:24:17.439]  There's something about America.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.520]  America.
[00:24:20.261 --> 00:24:22.142]  There's something about it that scares them.
[00:24:22.542 --> 00:24:24.323]  Because yeah, most of the evil's here.
[00:24:25.984 --> 00:24:28.366]  Because the power is here.
[00:24:29.977 --> 00:24:34.298]  Because the real Christ energy seeds were put here.
[00:24:35.498 --> 00:24:48.922]  All the evil buzzards and vampire bats and carrion crows descended upon it.
[00:24:50.642 --> 00:24:54.703]  But because there was something special there,
[00:24:58.857 --> 00:24:59.437]  And what was it?
[00:25:00.278 --> 00:25:02.219]  It's not some virtue signal.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.144]  It's not some, oh, we care about the black people thing.
[00:25:08.744 --> 00:25:10.365]  It was, we believe in humans.
[00:25:11.126 --> 00:25:20.693]  No matter what color they are, if they've got strength, we want to work with them, and we want to unify around human power that God gave us.
[00:25:22.214 --> 00:25:26.437]  Of course we didn't realize that when we first got the idea.
[00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:35.891]  It's like when you first have the idea to build a house or to marry a woman and have children and build a farm.
[00:25:36.131 --> 00:25:37.313]  It takes time.
[00:25:38.554 --> 00:25:39.115]  And we did it.
[00:25:43.795 --> 00:26:02.904]  Of unifying people around ideas scares these Satanists so much they're doing everything they can to tell you the system that stands in total resistance to what you call racism, tribalism, gang, garbage.
[00:26:05.985 --> 00:26:07.386]  Because we're the country.
[00:26:10.508 --> 00:26:11.348]  And we're the system.
[00:26:15.856 --> 00:26:16.496]  It stood against it.
[00:26:18.517 --> 00:26:32.803]  And so slave masters across the world hate the American system, from Communist China, to the European Union, to North Korea, to Venezuela, to Cuba, to every other center of evil.
[00:26:33.203 --> 00:26:38.886]  They are so scared because they've seen what it does and they don't like it!
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.903]  Because then it's not about how you were born, or what royal family you came from, or what communist party you were in.
[00:26:47.264 --> 00:26:49.145]  It was about what you did!
[00:26:50.546 --> 00:26:51.446]  What you built!
[00:26:52.207 --> 00:26:53.287]  What you stood for!
[00:26:53.627 --> 00:26:54.428]  Who you were!
[00:26:54.448 --> 00:26:57.730]  And then, the commoner starts winning.
[00:26:58.939 --> 00:27:05.866]  And they could be black, or they could be brown, or they could be pink, but they did something better than the elites, and the elites are scared.
[00:27:06.066 --> 00:27:07.787]  They say, we can't compete with them!
[00:27:08.308 --> 00:27:11.911]  Billions of these people, and out of them comes so much strength!
[00:27:14.053 --> 00:27:17.016]  We're not gonna let that grow!
[00:27:17.977 --> 00:27:22.181]  You can't let something like that happen, because out of that swamp,
[00:27:24.278 --> 00:27:28.541]  Grow so many flowers and things they can't compete with.
[00:27:28.882 --> 00:27:31.344]  The New World Order doesn't want to marry a beautiful flower.
[00:27:32.304 --> 00:27:33.325]  He doesn't want to smell it.
[00:27:33.926 --> 00:27:35.727]  He doesn't want to get to know it like I do.
[00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:37.869]  Tell something beautiful, something amazing.
[00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:38.449]  I want it.
[00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:42.152]  I don't care what's brown or pink or blue.
[00:27:42.593 --> 00:27:43.133]  I want it.
[00:27:44.174 --> 00:27:47.176]  They don't like, oh no, they don't like something pretty.
[00:27:47.897 --> 00:27:51.840]  They want to burn it down because they can't deal with it.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.963]  And so are we going to sit there and let them get in the way of our big plan?
[00:27:58.303 --> 00:28:00.105]  Because we'll take over the whole universe.
[00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:00.925]  Everybody knows it.
[00:28:01.866 --> 00:28:07.730]  You think these demons that are the nothing compared to us are happy because they know our destiny.
[00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.591]  They know the birthright you've got.
[00:28:11.414 --> 00:28:17.795]  And if they can con you to give up your birthright, just like Cain, oh, they're so happy.
[00:28:18.415 --> 00:28:22.276]  If you'll just give up that birthright, then everything will be so good.
[00:28:22.316 --> 00:28:23.176]  Give it to them.
[00:28:23.576 --> 00:28:24.176]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:26.577]  We're not giving it to them.
[00:28:27.037 --> 00:28:28.257]  It's our birthright.
[00:28:29.257 --> 00:28:40.439]  We've got red blood, and we are taking it right now as the promise of God, and we are accepting it, and we are overcoming the Satanists.
[00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:44.752]  And we are, oh, because you can be an atheist all day long.
[00:28:44.772 --> 00:28:46.192]  They teach you, oh, that's how you're really smart.
[00:28:46.773 --> 00:28:48.693]  You know, oh, you don't believe in God.
[00:28:48.713 --> 00:28:50.254]  Oh, you think man's an animal.
[00:28:50.734 --> 00:28:51.594]  Oh, you're so smart.
[00:28:51.754 --> 00:28:53.275]  Because they don't want you to have a defense.
[00:28:53.515 --> 00:28:56.676]  Because behind the scenes, they're in front of pentagrams.
[00:28:56.956 --> 00:28:58.077]  They're killing babies.
[00:28:58.117 --> 00:28:59.177]  They're devil worshipping.
[00:28:59.197 --> 00:29:00.337]  They've got their God.
[00:29:00.377 --> 00:29:01.598]  They believe he's got the power.
[00:29:01.878 --> 00:29:04.799]  And they know your God's got a thousand trillion times the power.
[00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:06.219]  And they don't know what to do.
[00:29:06.239 --> 00:29:10.641]  So they just say, don't you call on your God, because your God's not real!
[00:29:11.718 --> 00:29:13.239]  Give us the power!
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.581]  They don't have any power.
[00:29:22.244 --> 00:29:26.546]  All they have is the power to piss on God.
[00:29:27.725 --> 00:29:28.366]  To piss on you.
[00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:29.948]  To piss on reality.
[00:29:30.188 --> 00:29:31.330]  To piss on common sense.
[00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:38.860]  To piss on their own instincts that tell them, join freedom, join love, join God, join prosperity!
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.901]  It's all waiting!
[00:29:40.102 --> 00:29:41.504]  We can do anything!
[00:29:41.864 --> 00:29:43.066]  Unlimited resources.
[00:29:43.446 --> 00:29:44.588]  Unlimited expansion.
[00:29:44.888 --> 00:29:45.409]  It's all there.
[00:29:49.042 --> 00:29:51.943]  But Bill Gates tells you you gotta kill old people so you can have a job.
[00:29:52.383 --> 00:29:57.285]  You really think you're gonna kill old people and the person telling you kill old people really cares about you?
[00:29:57.885 --> 00:30:04.067]  They just want to see you kill somebody so they know you'll kill a bunch of more people and do what they want because they can't compete.
[00:30:04.367 --> 00:30:13.751]  You think that little piece of crap Bill Gates actually wants to empower you?
[00:30:16.191 --> 00:30:17.612]  He wants to eat your guts.
[00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:21.091]  Because he's a maggot.
[00:30:23.712 --> 00:30:27.953]  And because when that little slime bag goes around, he's spiritually aware.
[00:30:27.973 --> 00:30:33.295]  And he can see that your fire is so much bigger than his.
[00:30:35.996 --> 00:30:39.757]  Like Jimi Hendrix said, let me stand next to your fire.
[00:30:39.777 --> 00:30:43.838]  Bill Gates doesn't want to stand next to your fire.
[00:30:45.579 --> 00:30:46.879]  He wants to put your fire out.
[00:30:47.999 --> 00:30:49.480]  He doesn't want to be next to your fire.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.821]  He don't want to be part of your fire.
[00:30:51.841 --> 00:30:54.242]  He wants to take your fire away.
[00:30:56.764 --> 00:30:57.904]  Bill Gates doesn't have a fire.
[00:31:00.426 --> 00:31:05.388]  Bill Gates has a scientific viral plan to out your fire.
[00:31:05.969 --> 00:31:06.849]  To put you out.
[00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.570]  He doesn't like light.
[00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:09.931]  He likes death.
[00:31:13.686 --> 00:31:17.328]  And so you have to ask yourself, are you going to let him do it?
[00:31:17.708 --> 00:31:26.792]  Because the minute you discover he's your enemy, and the minute you go into your mind and say, God, tell me what to do.
[00:31:26.992 --> 00:31:29.613]  And the crosshairs hone in politically on him.
[00:31:30.213 --> 00:31:32.014]  Now you'll see how easy it is to be.
[00:31:33.214 --> 00:31:36.596]  We get a hundred thousand people praying every day for the fall of Bill Gates.
[00:31:36.616 --> 00:31:37.176]  He's gone.
[00:31:39.237 --> 00:31:39.937]  We don't have it yet.
[00:31:42.742 --> 00:31:47.465]  We may have millions of listeners, but we don't have the people yet who realize who they are.
[00:31:48.966 --> 00:31:51.787]  You could be old, you could be young, you could be black, you could be white.
[00:31:51.847 --> 00:32:02.413]  You love God, and you see through this enemy, and you simply pray to God to deliver you from Bill Gates, he will be broken.
[00:32:03.914 --> 00:32:04.694]  And he knows that.
[00:32:08.036 --> 00:32:10.738]  You've got the keys to hell and death.
[00:32:11.866 --> 00:32:12.606]  In your hand.
[00:32:13.627 --> 00:32:23.311]  All you've got to do is recognize who the real enemy is and stop giving them fealty and power and licensure over your life.
[00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:30.254]  All you've got to do is decide to stop caring about the lies they put out and stand against them.
[00:32:30.314 --> 00:32:34.795]  And at that moment forever, their power over you is broken.
[00:32:35.676 --> 00:32:36.456]  And they know that.
[00:32:37.016 --> 00:32:38.097]  That's why they want to kill you.
[00:32:39.419 --> 00:32:41.080]  They're not trying to dominate you.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.061]  They're not trying to get you to go along with them.
[00:32:43.301 --> 00:32:44.441]  That's that's phase one.
[00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.862]  They want you dead.
[00:32:47.903 --> 00:32:51.484]  He wants every damn person he looks at dead because he hates himself.
[00:32:53.225 --> 00:32:54.986]  Every minute of every day.
[00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:58.387]  Of every second.
[00:33:06.671 --> 00:33:06.811]  So.
[00:33:09.508 --> 00:33:11.710]  I should probably hit all this breaking news and some other stuff.
[00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.391]  I said I'd do two hours and I don't know if I will.
[00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:18.775]  But I wanted to come up here commercial free and talk about the reality of the planet.
[00:33:20.696 --> 00:33:21.156]  The planet.
[00:33:22.597 --> 00:33:27.120]  And the reality of the decisions that are being made now between you and God.
[00:33:28.561 --> 00:33:30.162]  Between you and eternity.
[00:33:31.223 --> 00:33:33.064]  Between you and eternity.
[00:33:33.705 --> 00:33:37.407]  Because it is one of my greatest failures and yours as well.
[00:33:38.382 --> 00:33:46.127]  That being on this planet, we have to talk about Bill Gates and Ted Turner and George Soros and Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:46.167 --> 00:33:51.910]  And it's a form of Satanism to even talk about them, to know the things they've done, to look at them.
[00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.631]  But we're falling.
[00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:54.251]  It's okay.
[00:33:54.271 --> 00:33:55.392]  We're down here in this.
[00:33:56.433 --> 00:33:57.453]  It's like a smoke.
[00:33:57.553 --> 00:33:59.154]  It's a thing we have to do.
[00:33:59.234 --> 00:34:04.437]  But isn't God that much more pure when staring through the stinking smoke of dead children?
[00:34:05.358 --> 00:34:06.959]  The rotten flesh of innocents.
[00:34:08.007 --> 00:34:18.049]  That as we huff this poison and we look at these little demons, that it lets us know how God is so pure.
[00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.211]  It is a very sad thing to have to look at these people.
[00:34:24.351 --> 00:34:28.432]  And I know with so many others run away to entertainment and other things to not look at them.
[00:34:28.492 --> 00:34:32.073]  And I understand why you run away from their stench.
[00:34:32.233 --> 00:34:32.713]  I get it.
[00:34:32.853 --> 00:34:33.733]  I'm not judging you.
[00:34:38.618 --> 00:34:41.141]  I wish I lived in a universe where Bill Gates didn't exist.
[00:34:41.701 --> 00:34:43.042]  But Satan does exist.
[00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:46.666]  And so you have to look at him.
[00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:51.211]  And you have to smell him.
[00:34:54.053 --> 00:34:55.455]  So that you know when to throw up.
[00:34:57.554 --> 00:34:59.375]  Because he's already inside of us all.
[00:34:59.475 --> 00:35:02.798]  He's already, we've been born on this planet with him there.
[00:35:02.818 --> 00:35:05.019]  Before we ever knew what hit us, he's already there.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.501]  He's already poisoning us.
[00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:08.122]  He's already in the water, the food, everywhere.
[00:35:08.522 --> 00:35:11.364]  And so we have to look at him and reject him.
[00:35:11.384 --> 00:35:12.145]  This is important.
[00:35:13.185 --> 00:35:17.649]  To then vomit him out and make the decision to cleanse ourselves with him.
[00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.170]  And go through the sickness.
[00:35:21.572 --> 00:35:22.252]  To reject Satan.
[00:35:24.053 --> 00:35:24.774]  And all of his servants.
[00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:28.379]  So reject Satan.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.800]  Reject Bill Gates.
[00:35:30.221 --> 00:35:30.581]  He's real.
[00:35:31.601 --> 00:35:31.942]  Satan's real.
[00:35:31.962 --> 00:35:33.803]  He wants to kill you.
[00:35:35.524 --> 00:35:35.904]  You see him?
[00:35:35.924 --> 00:35:36.664]  That's total power.
[00:35:36.704 --> 00:35:38.786]  He doesn't want you to have a vision or a future.
[00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:41.107]  You're your own operating system.
[00:35:41.147 --> 00:35:42.208]  You're your own program.
[00:35:42.228 --> 00:35:44.009]  You're your own system.
[00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:45.590]  You've got potential.
[00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.131]  And see, God believes in that.
[00:35:48.291 --> 00:35:49.912]  God wants to see what you're going to do.
[00:35:50.413 --> 00:35:51.253]  God's a gardener.
[00:35:51.293 --> 00:35:52.814]  Look at all these beautiful plants that are growing.
[00:35:52.834 --> 00:35:54.055]  They have their own free will.
[00:35:57.213 --> 00:35:58.214]  Bill Gates is on the card.
[00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:02.457]  Bill Gates is a destroyer.
[00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:20.052]  And Bill Gates is totally committed to not just killing your body, but to stealing your soul and your will to join with him for eternity and let him hypnotize you so that you join with him and then decide to spend eternity with him.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:29.324]  And that's what him and his wife and all these demons want is for you to join with them in eternity.
[00:36:29.424 --> 00:36:30.605]  They think they're God.
[00:36:31.305 --> 00:36:33.006]  And so it's all a big trick.
[00:36:33.286 --> 00:36:33.987]  Look at her eyes.
[00:36:34.987 --> 00:36:41.791]  It's nothing but hate and commitment to death and fraud and failure and that she's a piece of crap.
[00:36:42.171 --> 00:36:45.513]  And the only thing she can do is get you to go with her.
[00:36:45.833 --> 00:36:46.914]  It's all she has.
[00:36:47.674 --> 00:36:48.775]  It's all she'll ever be.
[00:36:50.182 --> 00:36:51.623]  I mean, her money is a joke.
[00:36:51.883 --> 00:36:53.204]  Her power is a fraud.
[00:36:53.705 --> 00:37:01.231]  Ghislaine Maxwell's father, all of them, they're all ridiculous fakes pretending that they're powerful.
[00:37:01.551 --> 00:37:06.354]  Bill Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein, Hillary Clinton, all of it, they're the losers.
[00:37:08.376 --> 00:37:11.078]  Hillary Clinton, a jack-o'-lantern demon.
[00:37:11.158 --> 00:37:11.618]  Look at her.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:13.600]  Ugh.
[00:37:16.482 --> 00:37:17.263]  Jimmy Savile.
[00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:27.536]  These are people that have decided they rule children and who love to take little crying children to rooms and brutally rape them.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.802]  You think in the universe that's the top of the 2J?
[00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:38.302]  It's the bottom.
[00:37:40.584 --> 00:37:45.507]  And God, if God had guilt, because God doesn't, God has to give us free will,
[00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:47.598]  To have communion with us.
[00:37:48.159 --> 00:37:52.400]  But if God had guilt, because God doesn't have guilt, but God can see guilt.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.101]  Doesn't accept the guilt because God gave us the gift.
[00:37:56.762 --> 00:38:01.083]  God looks down on this and thinks, why did I have to let people have free will to do this?
[00:38:01.123 --> 00:38:04.805]  Because God doesn't want robots.
[00:38:07.726 --> 00:38:15.829]  And it's all these losers deciding they're winners because they're willing to walk into a bedroom at night
[00:38:19.957 --> 00:38:24.163]  Because they're a prince, or they're a Jeffrey Epstein, or they're a Hillary Clinton.
[00:38:24.864 --> 00:38:29.289]  And they're gonna exercise their will on a child.
[00:38:31.753 --> 00:38:34.376]  Well, anybody with common sense goes, that's satanic.
[00:38:34.917 --> 00:38:36.459]  You're stealing a child's future.
[00:38:38.502 --> 00:38:41.303]  They go, oh, it's the child's own will.
[00:38:41.864 --> 00:38:48.807]  And that's their dream, is to take your children from you through public school and say, oh, your five-year-old identifies as a 50-year-old man.
[00:38:49.127 --> 00:38:50.168]  I'm going to have sex with him.
[00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:52.309]  That's what they're openly saying.
[00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:57.191]  That's their freakazoid system that they believe is going to give them power.
[00:38:58.652 --> 00:39:03.674]  So now, knowing who they are, do you have any fear of them?
[00:39:09.329 --> 00:39:10.489]  I mean, look at Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.971]  The self-satisfied look on his face.
[00:39:17.311 --> 00:39:17.712]  Look at it.
[00:39:17.852 --> 00:39:18.552]  Zoom that up.
[00:39:19.852 --> 00:39:24.294]  And his mind-control girlfriend, whose dad, you know, raped her and everything else.
[00:39:30.135 --> 00:39:31.796]  And all the other weird, creepy men.
[00:39:33.556 --> 00:39:36.697]  These aren't powerful people that Bill Gates hangs out with.
[00:39:37.778 --> 00:39:38.858]  These are weak people.
[00:39:40.558 --> 00:39:50.805]  Who go around and put on this act that they're invincible, and they're strong, and they're big, but all they think about is stealing children's essence.
[00:39:53.607 --> 00:39:54.787]  Stealing God's potential.
[00:40:00.751 --> 00:40:04.934]  And really all they are is warts on the back of history.
[00:40:07.045 --> 00:40:10.106]  You don't need to play God over children.
[00:40:10.146 --> 00:40:14.148]  But it's because you don't want to exercise dominion over this planet.
[00:40:14.168 --> 00:40:15.989]  Because you don't want to stand up to these serpents.
[00:40:37.145 --> 00:40:37.947]  These devils!
[00:40:39.129 --> 00:40:41.033]  You have now aided and abetted them.
[00:40:43.338 --> 00:40:44.701]  So you don't have an excuse anymore.
[00:40:47.647 --> 00:40:48.348]  God wants you.
[00:40:50.026 --> 00:40:53.968]  To become informed, involved, stand up and promote liberty.
[00:40:54.388 --> 00:40:55.909]  You don't have to go out and kill globalists.
[00:40:56.249 --> 00:40:58.970]  You don't have to go out and find the secret pedophile rings.
[00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.571]  You don't have to follow the secret breadcrumbs.
[00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:15.038]  You just have to get right with God, get focused, get involved, and then go out and promote justice and freedom and help people because you know you're good and you know you're strong and you know you don't service Satan.
[00:41:16.269 --> 00:41:20.211]  And so you are going to be able to stand up and say no to this system.
[00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:25.394]  Instead of saying, oh, that's corrupt, or this group's corrupt, or that's corrupt.
[00:41:25.594 --> 00:41:26.655]  Well, you're not corrupt.
[00:41:27.936 --> 00:41:29.236]  I mean, you have goodwill.
[00:41:29.417 --> 00:41:31.038]  You want to take action?
[00:41:31.298 --> 00:41:31.738]  Do it!
[00:41:37.081 --> 00:41:38.182]  I never aired this report.
[00:41:39.923 --> 00:41:40.543]  We should air it.
[00:41:46.698 --> 00:41:49.521]  We got Tucker Carlson, what holiday should be targeted next?
[00:41:50.522 --> 00:41:53.484]  We're actually talking about canceling 4th of July in 2020.
[00:41:53.564 --> 00:41:58.469]  We have AJ punished for COVID defiance.
[00:41:58.669 --> 00:41:59.390]  Oh, if you only knew.
[00:42:01.612 --> 00:42:04.595]  There's another report we did about the breakdown of society.
[00:42:04.615 --> 00:42:05.476]  It's like eight minutes long.
[00:42:06.176 --> 00:42:07.878]  I forgot to give that guys to you.
[00:42:15.089 --> 00:42:17.050]  Let's, let's just go through these.
[00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.491]  Let's play 11, 12, and 13 first.
[00:42:21.551 --> 00:42:27.573]  And then I'll come back and cover more news on this live Thursday transmission 742 Central Standard Time.
[00:42:27.593 --> 00:42:29.533]  I want to appreciate the crew coming in late tonight.
[00:42:29.834 --> 00:42:32.995]  Stay with us.
[00:42:33.035 --> 00:42:35.215]  Nothing, we're just looking at your sign.
[00:42:37.036 --> 00:42:39.457]  Right, you're coming out to play takeoff.
[00:42:39.537 --> 00:42:40.317]  Racist mother f***er.
[00:42:40.397 --> 00:42:41.117]  F*** you mean?
[00:42:45.399 --> 00:42:47.441]  Oh, you know, your **** is going viral.
[00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:48.021]  This ain't ****.
[00:42:48.502 --> 00:42:51.044]  You're going to have a whole group of **** out here.
[00:42:51.064 --> 00:42:52.565]  Guaranteed.
[00:42:53.346 --> 00:42:55.067]  Your **** went straight viral.
[00:42:55.888 --> 00:42:58.570]  Don't be surprised if there's a group of people out here.
[00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:02.574]  You **** racist piece of ****.
[00:43:02.874 --> 00:43:06.317]  And this **** right here want to reach out the window and do what?
[00:43:07.258 --> 00:43:09.480]  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:10.666 --> 00:43:11.527]  Can we burn it up?
[00:43:11.887 --> 00:43:13.309]  Can we put it in our bonfire?
[00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:16.331]  Please?
[00:43:21.316 --> 00:43:22.818]  Thank you so much.
[00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:25.940]  That is down.
[00:43:26.261 --> 00:43:26.961]  That's down.
[00:43:33.746 --> 00:43:35.787]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[00:43:35.967 --> 00:43:40.628]  We spent an awful lot of time this spring talking about viruses and how they spread.
[00:43:41.268 --> 00:43:51.410]  One person infects another person, who infects a third, who then has contact with a larger group of people and infects 20 more, each of whom, and you know how it works, it's exponential.
[00:43:51.991 --> 00:43:56.592]  Pretty soon, individuals thousands of miles from the source of the outbreak start getting sick.
[00:43:57.432 --> 00:44:01.336]  Well, we now know that craziness spreads very much the same way.
[00:44:01.936 --> 00:44:10.325]  A single lunatic can pass a debilitating case of it to millions of others with just one appearance on MSNBC or a long thread on Twitter.
[00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:17.291]  Hysteria is the most communicable disease known to man, and we're now living through a pandemic of it.
[00:44:18.032 --> 00:44:22.495]  A Memorial Day weekend, a man called George Floyd died in police custody in Minnesota.
[00:44:22.535 --> 00:44:24.177]  That's where this outbreak first began.
[00:44:24.597 --> 00:44:26.118]  Minneapolis was our Wuhan.
[00:44:26.678 --> 00:44:29.040]  The first cases appeared a little over a month ago.
[00:44:29.621 --> 00:44:31.002]  Here's the state of the pandemic now.
[00:44:32.245 --> 00:44:40.792]  It was just before midnight Thursday when protesters began dismantling and toppling the statue honoring Christopher Columbus in Civic Center Park.
[00:44:41.173 --> 00:44:45.256]  Crews moved in and destroyed what was left.
[00:44:45.857 --> 00:44:59.228]  One protester climbing up the statue and began spray-painting its face and hands, possibly symbolizing blood, while others spray-painted the words George Floyd, BLM for Black Lives Matter, and the communist symbol.
[00:45:05.481 --> 00:45:09.706]  And they have just torn down this statue of Christopher Columbus.
[00:45:10.106 --> 00:45:12.308]  The statue has been here since 1931.
[00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:21.498]  So to translate what you just saw into the clinical language of epidemiology, holy smokes, this is getting really crazy.
[00:45:22.279 --> 00:45:25.402]  What does Christopher Columbus have to do with George Floyd?
[00:45:25.743 --> 00:45:28.505]  Christopher Columbus was not a Minneapolis police officer.
[00:45:28.565 --> 00:45:33.810]  Christopher Columbus was an Italian navigator who died more than 500 years ago.
[00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:36.833]  Columbus probably never even heard of George Floyd.
[00:45:37.154 --> 00:45:39.516]  He almost certainly didn't mistreat him personally.
[00:45:40.197 --> 00:45:43.059]  So why are people attacking Columbus's statues?
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.460]  Well, who knows?
[00:45:44.821 --> 00:45:46.521]  You're definitely not allowed to ask.
[00:45:46.942 --> 00:45:50.123]  Questions are not permitted during hysteria epidemics.
[00:45:50.503 --> 00:45:54.305]  Logic of any kind seems to dramatically increase the severity of the symptoms.
[00:45:54.825 --> 00:46:11.974]  A patient may appear to be recovering from hysteria, speaking in nearly complete sentences, bathing independently on occasion, but then a single direct question will send him into a tailspin, a renewed attack of slogans shouting, anarchist graffiti, hours of hostile tweeting, the disease back in force.
[00:46:12.756 --> 00:46:13.957]  It's safer not to say a word.
[00:46:14.918 --> 00:46:18.983]  That's definitely the policy over at the Senate Republican Conference on Capitol Hill.
[00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:26.651]  Republican senators have decided not to disturb the patience in any way, even as they rampage through America, destroying our culture and history.
[00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:29.353]  It's easier to give them what they want, so that's what they're doing.
[00:46:30.114 --> 00:46:34.436]  Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and James Langford of Oklahoma are both Republican senators.
[00:46:34.897 --> 00:46:38.158]  Today they introduced legislation to abolish Columbus Day.
[00:46:38.438 --> 00:46:42.681]  They want to delete it from the national calendar and replace it with Juneteenth.
[00:46:43.321 --> 00:46:44.241]  This is a big change.
[00:46:44.762 --> 00:46:48.444]  Americans have celebrated Columbus Day as long as we have had a country since 1792.
[00:46:48.984 --> 00:46:52.566]  Columbus Day is a celebration of the nation itself.
[00:46:52.666 --> 00:46:54.587]  That's why it's a national holiday.
[00:46:55.478 --> 00:46:56.458]  Juneteenth is newer.
[00:46:56.919 --> 00:46:58.699]  Three weeks ago, many people had never heard of it.
[00:46:59.259 --> 00:47:01.961]  Even the media seemed oblivious to its existence.
[00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:10.324]  From 2012 through 2017, CNN did not mention the word Juneteenth a single time on the air.
[00:47:10.984 --> 00:47:17.387]  Barack Obama, who was the president, never tweeted about Juneteenth once during the entire span of his presidency.
[00:47:17.427 --> 00:47:18.067]  Not one time.
[00:47:19.195 --> 00:47:21.836]  Juneteenth commemorates the freeing of the American slaves.
[00:47:21.876 --> 00:47:25.617]  Emancipation is one of the great moments in America's history.
[00:47:25.637 --> 00:47:27.698]  It's why we consider Abraham Lincoln a hero.
[00:47:28.538 --> 00:47:36.201]  But paradoxically, and this is odd, the people who are pushing Juneteenth on the country do not consider Abraham Lincoln a hero.
[00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:38.462]  They're pulling down his statues along with Columbus's.
[00:47:39.182 --> 00:47:39.782]  Confused?
[00:47:40.343 --> 00:47:42.924]  Well, that's the nature of a hysteria outbreak.
[00:47:42.944 --> 00:47:43.644]  Nothing makes sense.
[00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:47.053]  Senators Johnson and Lankford may be a little confused as well.
[00:47:47.093 --> 00:47:51.256]  They describe themselves as conservatives, improbable as that may seem.
[00:47:51.816 --> 00:47:58.902]  On some level, they may suspect that all the yelling about Columbus Day and Juneteenth doesn't really have much to do with emancipation or civil rights.
[00:47:59.302 --> 00:48:02.705]  More likely, it's just another way to humiliate and demoralize Americans.
[00:48:03.185 --> 00:48:05.607]  On some level, they know that, but they're ignoring it.
[00:48:05.747 --> 00:48:08.109]  It's just easier to do with the hysteria patients command.
[00:48:08.962 --> 00:48:12.007]  Unless, of course, their voters notice them doing it.
[00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:17.414]  A couple of weeks ago, Senator Mike Braun of Indiana sponsored a bill designed to punish the police.
[00:48:17.915 --> 00:48:21.560]  At the very moment, the country was undergoing widespread looting, arson, and violence.
[00:48:21.601 --> 00:48:21.961]  Rioting.
[00:48:22.865 --> 00:48:26.927]  Then Braun endorsed the radical racial separatist BLM movement.
[00:48:27.748 --> 00:48:32.890]  At first, Braun's Republican constituents didn't seem to realize their senator had done any of this.
[00:48:33.551 --> 00:48:36.112]  But when they found out, they were enraged.
[00:48:36.212 --> 00:48:37.953]  And they let him know about it, loudly.
[00:48:38.333 --> 00:48:40.854]  Mike Braun is now running away from his own bill.
[00:48:41.375 --> 00:48:44.236]  If Mike Braun were up for election this year, he would lose.
[00:48:45.417 --> 00:48:48.999]  Senators Lankford and Johnson are praying nothing like that will happen to them.
[00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:56.271]  They're hoping to quietly eliminate Columbus Day and then move on to the next item on the rioters list.
[00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:57.452]  Alright, let me just jump in here.
[00:48:57.672 --> 00:48:58.513]  You know, that's the thing.
[00:48:58.633 --> 00:48:59.133]  I mean, look.
[00:48:59.914 --> 00:49:01.855]  Christopher Columbus had maps.
[00:49:03.016 --> 00:49:04.517]  The Vikings were already here.
[00:49:04.697 --> 00:49:07.739]  China was already doing trade deals with the Mesoamericans.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.402]  I mean, it wasn't a secret there was a new world, okay?
[00:49:10.802 --> 00:49:13.384]  I mean, nothing against Christopher Columbus, but he didn't discover it, okay?
[00:49:13.704 --> 00:49:15.265]  He just decided to commercialize it.
[00:49:16.946 --> 00:49:18.348]  The whole world had slaves!
[00:49:19.384 --> 00:49:25.086]  Every sector, there weren't nations in, there were regions, they all had slaves.
[00:49:25.666 --> 00:49:26.207]  So what?
[00:49:26.607 --> 00:49:28.908]  It's not a good thing, it's not a bad thing, it's what's going on.
[00:49:28.928 --> 00:49:32.829]  It's like Tyrannosaurus Rexes 50 million years ago were eating stuff.
[00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:34.590]  I mean, it's like, what does that mean?
[00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:41.232]  Like, I can't have a lizard in my backyard because it's related to Tyrannosaurus Rex that did something wrong.
[00:49:42.132 --> 00:49:43.833]  It's not even reality based.
[00:49:46.738 --> 00:49:50.340]  I mean, Africa, 500 years ago, was a giant war zone.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:51.621]  So was Europe.
[00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:54.002]  So was Japan.
[00:49:54.882 --> 00:49:56.283]  So was what's in Russia.
[00:49:56.863 --> 00:49:59.004]  So was, I mean, that's what we do.
[00:50:00.505 --> 00:50:11.511]  We're so successful as a species, we take over, we grow crops, we build palaces, we expand, we start going, that's our neighbor, and he's got a problem, and we're gonna capture him.
[00:50:12.491 --> 00:50:15.573]  Until Jesus Christ comes along.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:26.306]  And says, we need to love each other and love God, and we need to build a society together, and we need to stand for justice and freedom, and we can go to the stars together.
[00:50:29.548 --> 00:50:32.570]  That's why you've had in Rwanda, the Hootsies and the Tutus.
[00:50:33.571 --> 00:50:37.774]  One group was Christian, less than 10% of the population, had all the money, all the wealth.
[00:50:38.114 --> 00:50:41.797]  The other group were animus, they couldn't do anything, they couldn't get out of Mudd Huts.
[00:50:42.477 --> 00:50:44.579]  It was the same Africans, the same genetics.
[00:50:45.384 --> 00:50:53.992]  But the Christians created incredible wealth, had export deals and jobs, and the UN came in and killed almost all of them and turned it over to the devil worshippers.
[00:50:54.753 --> 00:50:55.734]  And now it's collapsed.
[00:50:57.415 --> 00:51:00.959]  So it wasn't about them being black people that made them inferior.
[00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:05.093]  It was that they didn't have Christianity.
[00:51:05.413 --> 00:51:06.134]  Same thing in Europe.
[00:51:06.554 --> 00:51:11.618]  You know, you'll hear some of the black nationalist supremacists say, it's true, it's like, shut up, white people!
[00:51:11.978 --> 00:51:13.159]  You're a cave dweller!
[00:51:13.519 --> 00:51:18.003]  Why, 500 years ago or a thousand years ago, you were living in a cave!
[00:51:18.723 --> 00:51:19.264]  It's true!
[00:51:19.944 --> 00:51:21.565]  Who wouldn't live in a cave if you're in Europe?
[00:51:21.806 --> 00:51:22.946]  It's a big, raid-money house.
[00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:31.233]  But, the thing was, it was a culture, even though they were super smart people, just like anybody else, they could fight with each other and take stuff.
[00:51:32.799 --> 00:51:40.207]  And so everything wasn't about science or math or building something or building a castle or growing crops.
[00:51:40.628 --> 00:51:46.274]  It was about how big is your sword and are you willing to kill people just like Africa?
[00:51:50.632 --> 00:51:55.614]  And then along comes the collapse of the Roman Empire and Christianity right before it.
[00:51:56.295 --> 00:52:01.637]  And suddenly, these people are told, work together, love each other, build things.
[00:52:01.758 --> 00:52:09.621]  And suddenly, they can still fight if they need to, but suddenly they're able to do incredible things.
[00:52:12.603 --> 00:52:14.524]  Because it wasn't about
[00:52:16.994 --> 00:52:22.359]  What tribe they were in, because you study Europe, just like Crips and the Bloods and black people, we're all the same.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.382]  How much we're the same is ridiculous.
[00:52:25.482 --> 00:52:28.625]  I mean, it's identical, other than what color we are.
[00:52:30.967 --> 00:52:33.489]  Crips are blue, Bloods are red.
[00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:38.754]  It'd be the same thing in Germany or Gaul that was France, or the Visigoths that was Austria.
[00:52:39.215 --> 00:52:42.678]  It would literally be like one wore a green hat, one wore a red hat.
[00:52:43.672 --> 00:52:54.524]  Or one had this on their shoulder, another had that on their shoulder, and that was the reason to kill them, was literally what tribe they were in.
[00:52:55.585 --> 00:52:59.270]  And so, and let me tell you, when you're in a tribe that somebody wants to kill,
[00:53:00.435 --> 00:53:14.006]  And you're down there catching fish with your kids, and you don't know the other tribe's invading, and all of a sudden, 500 warriors are racing down on you, and they've told them, oh, this tribe screwed us over, and this tribe killed our people, and you probably did, you've been to wars with them.
[00:53:16.809 --> 00:53:24.235]  And all of a sudden, they're rushing down on you, and you even look just like them, like Hootsies and Tutus, or Germans versus Visigoths.
[00:53:25.816 --> 00:53:28.639]  You look just like them, but you're killing each other.
[00:53:30.455 --> 00:53:35.257]  Well, how much easier is it when we look different to get us to do that?
[00:53:35.797 --> 00:53:37.238]  Even easier!
[00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:43.861]  And that's what the whole AI takeover system is about.
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:54:01.736]  Instead of us saying, we're about basic freedoms for humans, we want to organize for a better future for humans, we want to build rule of law for humans, we want to build a system where we have free will to do what we want, be part of any group we want, that's what freedom is.
[00:54:02.477 --> 00:54:07.302]  And see, America never fully reached that, but we tried that.
[00:54:08.632 --> 00:54:16.859]  And the black supremacist and the white supremacist will say, well that didn't how it works, Jones, and you're a traitor because you didn't join one group or another.
[00:54:17.179 --> 00:54:18.600]  Let me tell you something.
[00:54:19.461 --> 00:54:21.442]  I've seen how the book ends.
[00:54:21.763 --> 00:54:26.967]  They've got AI computers and robot takeovers about to take place.
[00:54:27.147 --> 00:54:29.289]  They're going to kill all of us.
[00:54:30.149 --> 00:54:34.373]  So while you're busy fighting with each other over what color you are,
[00:54:36.377 --> 00:54:41.158]  Or what color kilt you've got, like the Scots killing each other, until the British showed up.
[00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:45.699]  Hundreds of different clans, they'd kill each other over what their, the patches were.
[00:54:45.779 --> 00:54:47.120]  I get it, it's tribalism.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.280]  It's how you identify.
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.581]  I'm part of this group, not part of that group.
[00:54:50.981 --> 00:54:54.902]  That's how the world works with resources, until we have unlimited resources.
[00:54:56.502 --> 00:54:59.023]  But what about humans against computers?
[00:54:59.303 --> 00:55:02.904]  Because look, I'm not against computers, except evil men
[00:55:04.212 --> 00:55:10.153]  Have programmed those computers against us to displace us and make us obsolete.
[00:55:10.513 --> 00:55:11.774]  I don't need to be obsolete.
[00:55:11.974 --> 00:55:12.734]  I need a future.
[00:55:14.354 --> 00:55:15.374]  And so I'll tell you right now.
[00:55:17.515 --> 00:55:18.575]  You don't think I'm racial?
[00:55:18.835 --> 00:55:21.456]  You don't think I've got Klan behavior?
[00:55:21.476 --> 00:55:22.796]  And I don't mean KKK.
[00:55:22.836 --> 00:55:23.896]  I mean clans.
[00:55:23.936 --> 00:55:24.736]  Humans are in clans.
[00:55:25.016 --> 00:55:27.097]  You don't think I don't see all that stuff?
[00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:28.417]  It's a lie!
[00:55:29.977 --> 00:55:35.501]  We have to come together for a human future now or we don't have a hope.
[00:55:36.662 --> 00:55:39.504]  I can tell you right now that most of humanity is going to be wiped out.
[00:55:40.765 --> 00:55:42.907]  Because prosperity brings weakness and we're going to get wiped out.
[00:55:44.608 --> 00:55:54.276]  But serious men and serious women need to start having a discussion about what type of future we're going to have because we're being displaced.
[00:55:55.197 --> 00:55:59.320]  Well, they got us fighting over what color our skin is or where we came from or
[00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:05.099]  All this crap, the New World Order, is coming against our children.
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.621]  And I tell you, the globalists know this.
[00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:16.283]  They can take children of any color, and they can try to program them however they want.
[00:56:18.844 --> 00:56:19.385]  But you know what?
[00:56:20.725 --> 00:56:22.246]  I don't want to program children.
[00:56:24.226 --> 00:56:25.867]  I want to show children the universe.
[00:56:29.889 --> 00:56:41.699]  And I want them to see their own vision and realize they don't need to hurt somebody because they're white, or hurt somebody because they're black, or hurt somebody because they're brown.
[00:56:43.501 --> 00:56:44.622]  Because that doesn't matter.
[00:56:44.662 --> 00:56:47.644]  What matters is their heart and the vision they have.
[00:56:49.426 --> 00:56:55.671]  And I want them to realize there's a threat against that common human purpose of the New World Order.
[00:56:57.901 --> 00:57:03.983]  And I want them to turn that power loose because we can do anything, anything we want.
[00:57:05.083 --> 00:57:22.628]  And the enemy that is not of this world, as the Bible tells us, knows we have that potential and knows that when we become one, it doesn't mean one in our language and one in one program, when we become one in our humanity, that that gives us so much power.
[00:57:23.308 --> 00:57:25.249]  And that's what Martin Luther King talked about.
[00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:28.011]  And that's why he could get white people to do the right thing.
[00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:29.872]  Even though they were in the position of power.
[00:57:30.192 --> 00:57:31.993]  Because they looked up to themselves.
[00:57:32.273 --> 00:57:35.756]  And they didn't want to put somebody down so they could feel big and powerful.
[00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:37.797]  They wanted to empower people.
[00:57:38.157 --> 00:57:39.938]  And that is the spirit of God.
[00:57:42.019 --> 00:57:45.241]  And that's what the enemy is working around the clock to try to stop.
[00:57:47.543 --> 00:57:49.284]  They want to kill every last one of us.
[00:57:50.484 --> 00:57:51.545]  I'm going to tell you this again.
[00:57:51.605 --> 00:57:52.766]  I can't tell you any stronger.
[00:57:53.951 --> 00:57:55.412]  There's no debate about this.
[00:57:56.152 --> 00:57:57.672]  There's no discussion about this.
[00:57:58.813 --> 00:58:00.794]  They're creating a post-human world.
[00:58:04.155 --> 00:58:16.440]  And all these fools that think they're gonna join Satan... You can't join with death.
[00:58:17.781 --> 00:58:21.882]  You can't lie to yourself and tell yourself... Look at this demon possessed woman.
[00:58:22.462 --> 00:58:23.103]  You can't...
[00:58:24.171 --> 00:58:27.794]  Sign on to something that is sworn to destroy you!
[00:58:27.814 --> 00:58:38.363]  I'm almost an hour into this rant, and I could talk for 10 hours, but I don't know what the point is.
[00:58:39.384 --> 00:58:42.887]  You guys gave me the last programs from the last few days, a few promos I didn't play.
[00:58:43.308 --> 00:58:45.569]  There's one I did on the Collapsed Society, it should be seen.
[00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:49.673]  That's number seven.
[00:58:53.592 --> 00:58:55.573]  This is kind of an infomercial, but it hasn't aired yet.
[00:58:55.633 --> 00:58:56.574]  It's got some important information.
[00:58:56.854 --> 00:58:58.915]  We'll air this, and I'll come back, and I'll cover the facts.
[00:58:59.596 --> 00:59:00.536]  But I'm just telling you, man.
[00:59:00.596 --> 00:59:01.597]  I'm betting on you, man.
[00:59:01.697 --> 00:59:06.280]  It's not some goody-two-shoe thing.
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:07.741]  People are like, holy, thank you, Alex.
[00:59:08.181 --> 00:59:09.682]  Thank you for betting on humans?
[00:59:10.022 --> 00:59:11.563]  I mean, what else do I got?
[00:59:12.184 --> 00:59:13.845]  Plus, I know how amazing you are.
[00:59:15.086 --> 00:59:17.667]  So stop thinking like it's special to bet on humanity.
[00:59:18.548 --> 00:59:20.329]  That's the bare minimum.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.521]  Start betting on us.
[00:59:25.282 --> 00:59:29.965]  Anybody that tells you we're hurting the earth, anybody that tells you we suck, that's the enemy right there.
[00:59:32.286 --> 00:59:36.109]  And it doesn't mean we hate those people, we just don't have anything to do with them.
[00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:38.550]  I mean, look at Chef.
[00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:40.051]  I mean, just give me a break, man.
[00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:42.173]  You don't let that guy babysit your kids.
[00:59:42.253 --> 00:59:42.813]  I mean, look at that.
[00:59:42.853 --> 00:59:44.234]  That is not a human right there.
[00:59:45.902 --> 00:59:51.684]  That is a psychotic program turned loose to kill us because that's all it knows.
[00:59:51.744 --> 00:59:57.867]  I mean, it's like the enemy spaceship lands like in Oblivion and out comes Ted, you know, Tom Cruise.
[00:59:59.527 --> 01:00:01.468]  Ted Cruz comes out too, I guess.
[01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.609]  I mean, you know, that's what it is.
[01:00:03.969 --> 01:00:04.929]  He doesn't know.
[01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:12.152]  And it's not a mean thing to say that about him, but he doesn't have a soul.
[01:00:17.284 --> 01:00:25.690]  Because when you get a man and a woman together, I figured this out, several generations that are devil worshipers, they start having kids that don't even have a light bulb.
[01:00:27.131 --> 01:00:28.332]  And nobody puts that in books.
[01:00:28.472 --> 01:00:29.673]  I'm just telling you, that's what I see.
[01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:37.858]  Is that people like Schiff, their elevators don't go to the top.
[01:00:39.259 --> 01:00:41.080]  And I'm sure you've heard that term before.
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.102]  They don't go to the top, folks.
[01:00:54.133 --> 01:00:55.734]  I tell you, Oblivion is such an important movie.
[01:00:55.774 --> 01:00:56.935]  Actually, let's talk about that more.
[01:00:57.815 --> 01:00:59.817]  That's exactly what they've got planned for us.
[01:01:00.517 --> 01:01:01.978]  That's actually in Revelations, actually.
[01:01:01.998 --> 01:01:06.821]  Oh, boy.
[01:01:06.841 --> 01:01:12.204]  All right, let's go ahead and go to that report.
[01:01:12.224 --> 01:01:12.765]  I'll be right back.
[01:01:12.785 --> 01:01:13.125]  Stay with us.
[01:01:32.028 --> 01:01:46.282]  Hollywood, the Democratic Party, the unelected EU bureaucracy, and the Fortune 100 corporations are almost unanimously rooting against America, against the American people, and against our President Donald Trump.
[01:01:46.802 --> 01:01:55.090]  They're all over the news saying the American century's over, and the Chinese dragon is taking over, and that America's quarantined.
[01:01:55.490 --> 01:02:04.212]  And that COVID-19 was our fault, and that the United States may not even exist in the future, and certainly isn't going to be a superpower.
[01:02:04.952 --> 01:02:08.953]  This is what the Democrats are openly saying, like Joe Biden.
[01:02:09.613 --> 01:02:17.215]  And he puts out bizarre lies, like 120 million have died from COVID-19, and the media doesn't even challenge him on it.
[01:02:17.515 --> 01:02:24.779]  What people drastically underestimate is the impact on the mental health of people who now everything is complicated.
[01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:28.761]  Not only is the health care piece, but people don't have a job.
[01:02:28.821 --> 01:02:30.482]  People don't have anywhere to go.
[01:02:30.522 --> 01:02:31.863]  They don't know what they're going to do.
[01:02:32.483 --> 01:02:35.465]  And a lot of people you have unnecessarily.
[01:02:35.525 --> 01:02:38.567]  Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID.
[01:02:38.627 --> 01:02:42.109]  Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID.
[01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:44.790]  They are rooting against this country.
[01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:46.211]  And I've got to be honest with you.
[01:02:47.555 --> 01:03:02.264]  If they are successful removing President Trump, one way or another, with this election in 125 days, they have already said they're going to have a scorched earth policy against nationalists, against conservatives, against Christians and others.
[01:03:02.685 --> 01:03:13.892]  And that they're going to use racial division to destabilize the country further and collapse it into a deep depression and bring in the United Nations to actually manage the country.
[01:03:14.352 --> 01:03:17.455]  What you're watching is class war disguised as race war.
[01:03:17.475 --> 01:03:22.439]  Keep the population at one another's throats, angry, suspicious, tribal, and maybe they'll never figure out how much we're stealing.
[01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:44.136]  The biggest change to American society over the past 50 years has been the death of the middle class.
[01:03:44.757 --> 01:03:46.359]  This used to be a middle-class country.
[01:03:46.559 --> 01:03:47.581]  It is not anymore.
[01:03:48.201 --> 01:03:55.391]  Most of our population has become poorer in real terms, while a shrinking number of people control an ever-expanding percentage of our wealth.
[01:03:56.132 --> 01:04:01.819]  That means that fewer Americans overall have a meaningful stake in the society, and more are dependent.
[01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:05.563]  That makes the country much more volatile than it once was.
[01:04:06.224 --> 01:04:08.226]  These riots really shouldn't surprise you.
[01:04:08.827 --> 01:04:16.715]  If we underestimate how dangerous this is, and if we don't expose how powerful global forces are playing us off against each other,
[01:04:17.356 --> 01:04:21.121]  They have a good chance of actually succeeding.
[01:04:21.542 --> 01:04:27.009]  They haven't spent hundreds of billions of dollars in the last few decades building this up for no reason.
[01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:29.653]  They also admit that a collapsed U.S.
[01:04:30.194 --> 01:04:32.537]  will, quote, cut the global carbon footprint.
[01:04:32.797 --> 01:04:38.320]  You've seen the disruption in some of the most sophisticated supply chain countries in the world, like the United States.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.902]  And you can imagine if you have a problem there,
[01:05:02.194 --> 01:05:02.675]  What's going on?
[01:05:12.856 --> 01:05:15.398]  The New World Order has suppressed and enslaved the Third World.
[01:05:38.832 --> 01:05:44.476]  And their COVID-19 lockdown, not the virus, is already starving millions to death right now.
[01:05:45.196 --> 01:05:52.001]  They admit that they are engineering this planetary collapse to bring in a tyrannical one-world government.
[01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:59.806]  And all that stands in its way is the Christian idea of basic freedom that the West has promoted and stood for.
[01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:01.567]  The West is corrupt.
[01:06:01.588 --> 01:06:02.369]  We have a lot of problems.
[01:06:02.409 --> 01:06:03.370]  And we've sinned as well.
[01:06:03.811 --> 01:06:07.115]  But, compared to the New World Order, we are night and day.
[01:06:07.275 --> 01:06:15.967]  That's why they've got to have the idea of America and the idea that Martin Luther King promoted about us all coming together for what we stand for, not what color we are, destroyed.
[01:06:16.468 --> 01:06:23.536]  Because the New World Order wants to use our differences, like the Tower of Babel worldwide, to control us, not enlighten us, not empower us.
[01:06:23.757 --> 01:06:25.038]  They don't want real diversity.
[01:06:25.399 --> 01:06:35.491]  They want global, corporate control over every action of our lives, with a planetary, AI, big tech, social score, monitoring, surveilling and controlling our every move.
[01:06:37.435 --> 01:06:42.361]  We have to be politically more engaged than we've ever been before to stop this new allure takeover.
[01:06:43.102 --> 01:06:47.768]  But we also have to understand that we have to reach out to God and pray and ask for God's intervention.
[01:06:48.188 --> 01:06:50.892]  And we also have to be physically prepared for what's happening.
[01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:54.757]  If you don't have a firearm and don't know how to use it, don't have ammo, you really should get some.
[01:06:55.197 --> 01:06:55.497]  I think so.
[01:07:14.437 --> 01:07:25.525]  The New World Order social engineers are all on record that their entire program is about domesticating us, dumbing us down, and making it to where we are not self-sufficient.
[01:07:26.186 --> 01:07:36.193]  During the Great Depression in the 1920s, it's estimated by major universities that around 7 million Americans starved to death from malnutrition or died from diseases because their immune systems were run down.
[01:07:37.114 --> 01:07:42.201]  Now, back then we were 90% rural, and almost everybody was self-sufficient.
[01:07:42.221 --> 01:07:49.231]  Now we're 90% urban, and of the 10% that are rural, it's estimated that less than half of those are actually self-sufficient.
[01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:53.000]  We are sitting on top of a time bomb.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.821]  We have been domesticated.
[01:07:55.261 --> 01:08:00.343]  I know how to skin a buck and run a trot line, but I don't know one one-hundredth of what my grandfather knew.
[01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.864]  I don't know one twentieth of what my dad knew.
[01:08:03.344 --> 01:08:05.225]  And quite frankly, I've dropped the ball.
[01:08:05.385 --> 01:08:06.686]  My children are city slickers.
[01:08:07.206 --> 01:08:08.786]  They know how to shoot a gun, change a tire.
[01:08:09.207 --> 01:08:09.807]  That's about it.
[01:08:10.447 --> 01:08:15.050]  We need to get back to the land, back to self-sufficiency, and back to being prepared.
[01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:23.856]  And the way to start, ladies and gentlemen, is having friends and family with a bug-out plan if there is a total collapse, and water filtration, and food to last you at least a few months.
[01:08:24.516 --> 01:08:26.777]  And the food we have is very high quality.
[01:08:27.018 --> 01:08:29.379]  It's in great containers that are great to be mobile.
[01:08:29.739 --> 01:08:32.081]  They have wide selections, special diets, you name it.
[01:08:32.321 --> 01:08:35.203]  It's the best price you're going to find for quality food like this.
[01:08:35.303 --> 01:08:38.445]  And most importantly, all the other big companies have become fly-by-night.
[01:08:38.885 --> 01:08:39.045]  I think?
[01:08:57.632 --> 01:08:57.752]  Yeah.
[01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:19.315]  Things are just going to get more crazy and this food lasts 25 years inside the containers.
[01:09:19.676 --> 01:09:25.842]  So it's something you can hide, something you can bury, something you know is an ace in the hole for you and your family in the future.
[01:09:26.383 --> 01:09:31.268]  And the little bit of profit that comes in funds the InfoWar to continue to warn the people.
[01:09:31.608 --> 01:09:37.894]  So you're also funding InfoWars, the most powerful Paul Revere organization in the world, and it's powered by you.
[01:09:38.455 --> 01:09:40.757]  Get ready, get prepared, spread the word.
[01:09:40.797 --> 01:09:47.223]  Whatever you do, pray to God and get yourself right with God, because this is the real deal, and things only get crazier from here on out.
[01:09:47.823 --> 01:09:48.684]  Good luck and God bless.
[01:09:48.704 --> 01:09:53.549]  All right, I'm proud of that infomercial, because it's true.
[01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.090]  You see, it's horrible food.
[01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:56.011]  Might as well get it from us.
[01:10:02.762 --> 01:10:12.594]  You know, it's not some building suspense thing where I get up here and I go, I've got all these articles, I've got all this news, I can't talk.
[01:10:15.528 --> 01:10:16.468]  I just can't talk.
[01:10:17.309 --> 01:10:18.470]  I just can't do this anymore.
[01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:19.671]  I just can't do it anymore.
[01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:30.899]  Like I felt driven the night to come down here and do a couple hours and Matt came in and Daria and Wes and you know and Rob and all the rest of the crew and I love you guys so much and he put up with me.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.381]  I really appreciate that.
[01:10:34.943 --> 01:10:38.966]  There's just a feeling like we should fix it but it's kind of like a plane crash.
[01:10:39.566 --> 01:10:40.407]  It's all burned up.
[01:10:40.427 --> 01:10:44.090]  There's dead bodies on the field and we're just out there trying to like
[01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:47.544]  Put it all back together again and we just can't fix it, can we?
[01:10:50.686 --> 01:10:58.192]  And you know, that's what I feel guilty about is I just more and more just think I should get myself ready.
[01:10:59.073 --> 01:11:00.934]  Seriously, I can't lie to you.
[01:11:01.315 --> 01:11:02.896]  So I'm just going to tell you the truth.
[01:11:03.256 --> 01:11:09.841]  I think you better get your ass ready with God and everything else because this planet's a damn time bomb.
[01:11:10.742 --> 01:11:11.683]  And I think everybody knows that.
[01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:16.030]  It's Tom Bomb.
[01:11:18.772 --> 01:11:19.373]  It's Tom Bomb.
[01:11:21.074 --> 01:11:31.361]  And, you know, as bad as stuff is, it's good for you to just realize that at least you have a relationship with God.
[01:11:32.322 --> 01:11:32.802]  And me too.
[01:11:34.243 --> 01:11:39.647]  Because this whole thing's counting down now.
[01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:56.378]  And the weakness of the average person is so incredible that it's very hard to even try to, I mean, listen, this thing's designed to kill people.
[01:11:56.839 --> 01:11:58.140]  I mean, let's not lie about it.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:02.423]  And if you go along with it, it kills you last.
[01:12:02.523 --> 01:12:05.625]  Well, who wants to be part of that?
[01:12:08.708 --> 01:12:10.309]  Who wants to get killed last?
[01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:23.381]  I mean, what does it matter to be accepted by the system when the system's a lie?
[01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:32.623]  I mean, I don't know anymore.
[01:12:38.544 --> 01:12:40.965]  And you know, I've said this a thousand times, I'll say it again.
[01:12:42.585 --> 01:12:55.835]  Because now more than ever, I'm going to take political action, I'm going to take economic action, I'm going to take cultural action, I'm going to take physical action, I'm going to take metaphysical action, I'm going to take action.
[01:13:00.279 --> 01:13:01.179]  But am I pretending?
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.341]  The only action that matters is God.
[01:13:05.123 --> 01:13:10.126]  All God looks at is, what did we do when we were under challenge?
[01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:11.727]  It isn't about our power.
[01:13:12.228 --> 01:13:13.929]  It isn't about what we did.
[01:13:14.469 --> 01:13:16.771]  It's about the decision we made.
[01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:23.851]  And so every day I tell myself, I'm so upset for the broadcaster on the day.
[01:13:23.891 --> 01:13:26.232]  I'm just like, this is such a big enemy.
[01:13:26.772 --> 01:13:27.452]  I've scanned it.
[01:13:27.552 --> 01:13:28.172]  I've looked at it.
[01:13:28.292 --> 01:13:30.213]  I'm just like, it's so big.
[01:13:30.293 --> 01:13:36.094]  How am I going to, I just, oh God, it's so, it's not that I can't handle it.
[01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:38.015]  It's that it's so big.
[01:13:38.995 --> 01:13:41.116]  And God says, it's not about you doing that.
[01:13:42.236 --> 01:13:44.216]  It's about your decision.
[01:13:45.817 --> 01:13:46.717]  And that's what I'm telling you.
[01:13:48.188 --> 01:13:54.573]  You have to stop worrying about Satan's power and the devil's systems and all the minions.
[01:13:54.653 --> 01:13:57.075]  And you got to realize it's not you that's got the power.
[01:13:58.315 --> 01:14:06.301]  And listen, I'm not preaching it when I tell you this, it's me telling myself, because as a man, I want to beat Satan's ass.
[01:14:07.462 --> 01:14:12.606]  I want to take Lucifer and slam his head in the ground and bash his brains out.
[01:14:12.886 --> 01:14:13.867]  I can't do it.
[01:14:15.478 --> 01:14:19.501]  And if Satan can trick you to try to contend with him, he wins.
[01:14:20.001 --> 01:14:22.563]  But you call Jesus him, you're gonna win every time.
[01:14:22.963 --> 01:14:31.429]  That's why callers call in, they just apologize for, oh my God, my God, my whole show ought to just be Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
[01:14:31.829 --> 01:14:33.110]  The whole show.
[01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:37.853]  And that doesn't mean some preacher or some corrupt system that doesn't know.
[01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:39.334]  I mean the real deal.
[01:14:39.574 --> 01:14:40.955]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:14:41.275 --> 01:14:42.696]  I've been in fights with the devil.
[01:14:42.996 --> 01:14:44.577]  I've been toe-to-toe with the New World Order.
[01:14:44.917 --> 01:14:47.139]  I've been there up against them in Congress.
[01:14:47.419 --> 01:14:49.500]  And I've been up against them at Bohemian Grove.
[01:14:49.801 --> 01:14:51.462]  And I've been up against them at 2 a.m.
[01:14:51.482 --> 01:14:52.122]  in the middle of the night.
[01:14:52.382 --> 01:14:56.025]  And let me tell you what name sends them running is Jesus Christ!
[01:14:57.085 --> 01:14:58.866]  You call on Jesus Christ at 5 a.m.
[01:15:02.762 --> 01:15:06.144]  They turn and they run so damn fast it'll make your head spin.
[01:15:06.924 --> 01:15:08.986]  They're so damn scared of that name.
[01:15:09.986 --> 01:15:11.867]  They're so scared of that power.
[01:15:12.948 --> 01:15:15.309]  That's where it all is, is Jesus Christ.
[01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:16.490]  Jesus Christ.
[01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:17.571]  Jesus Christ.
[01:15:18.993 --> 01:15:20.953]  And they brainwashed the Baptists, who are good people.
[01:15:20.993 --> 01:15:25.434]  Most of my family are Baptists, that if you call on Jesus, you see some evil thing, you go, Jesus.
[01:15:25.994 --> 01:15:28.895]  Or you see your grandfather die, or grandmother die, you go, Jesus.
[01:15:29.215 --> 01:15:30.755]  Oh, don't take, well, that's not taking the Lord's name in vain.
[01:15:30.975 --> 01:15:32.656]  You're calling out to God.
[01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:35.696]  And they want you to think that's taking the Lord's name in vain.
[01:15:35.736 --> 01:15:40.157]  No, calling out to God is what you're supposed to do.
[01:15:41.197 --> 01:15:44.518]  It's all the heart, and it's what God intends.
[01:15:48.422 --> 01:15:50.202]  But I can sit here and I can preach for a thousand hours.
[01:15:52.283 --> 01:15:55.063]  I can just tell you right now that I've seen the Satanists.
[01:15:56.143 --> 01:16:01.444]  And they are the most pathetic, disgusting people you'll ever imagine.
[01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:08.485]  Because they're on such power trips, they'll never bow down to God.
[01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.206]  They only bow down to evil.
[01:16:15.587 --> 01:16:17.547]  They think it's a joke to bow down to Christ.
[01:16:19.864 --> 01:16:22.051]  And you know where bowing down comes from, right?
[01:16:23.115 --> 01:16:23.576]  The weight.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:29.882]  Like, you actually get in the presence of God, you want to bow down.
[01:16:30.362 --> 01:16:33.964]  You want to, like, do this, because it's big.
[01:16:34.664 --> 01:16:35.685]  It's coming in.
[01:16:35.885 --> 01:16:37.365]  It's heavy.
[01:16:38.466 --> 01:16:45.769]  It's arrogant to try to, like, lean up into that, the whole universe, eternity, that consciousness.
[01:16:46.489 --> 01:16:48.790]  You're kind of like, man, this is some heavy stuff.
[01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:52.092]  I better lay down, because I can't handle it.
[01:16:53.868 --> 01:16:59.271]  And that's why Satanists are Satanists, I'll tell you a secret, because they can't stand one trillionth of God.
[01:17:00.872 --> 01:17:06.314]  They want to stand up and say they're powerful and they're big and they're in charge.
[01:17:06.634 --> 01:17:10.436]  I'm like this big ass chicken, this rooster running around.
[01:17:10.716 --> 01:17:11.777]  I'm in charge.
[01:17:11.897 --> 01:17:13.118]  I'm the new world order.
[01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:15.739]  I know what's going on on this planet and everything else.
[01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:23.003]  And just the minute God's spirit comes into things,
[01:17:24.127 --> 01:17:28.390]  They run because there's only one place their heads are going, that's down.
[01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:34.234]  There's only one place you're going in the presence of eternity.
[01:17:35.754 --> 01:17:48.941]  And all your sins, and all your good things, and all your bad things, and your grandma, and your grandpa, and your wife, and your girlfriends, and what you did, and everything else, because it's all there, and you're in the presence of that, and you just go, I can't handle this.
[01:17:49.302 --> 01:17:54.344]  But imagine these Satanists, they go, I don't want that, I want my power!
[01:17:55.605 --> 01:17:59.387]  And so God says, you've been given control over your own life then.
[01:17:59.647 --> 01:18:02.109]  You're this little ocean of evil.
[01:18:03.328 --> 01:18:09.796]  And then you go out and you say, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna molest a child.
[01:18:09.816 --> 01:18:12.340]  And why do you do that?
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.863]  Because that child is the universe.
[01:18:16.556 --> 01:18:30.105]  That child is the potential of the universe and you think that if you can molest it, if you can abuse it, if you can attack it, that somehow it makes you empower of it.
[01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:42.634]  And that's all this is, is the same mentally ill dream over and over and over and over again of Satanist trying to dominate consciousness.
[01:18:45.089 --> 01:18:53.844]  Instead of turning loose to it, imagine turning loose to consciousness.
[01:18:55.607 --> 01:18:56.669]  Imagine just letting go.
[01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.424]  Oh, but then you're not a big, powerful Satanist.
[01:19:04.164 --> 01:19:14.151]  Only a big, powerful Satanist can maintain control in all this and focus their will and do what they think's best.
[01:19:14.331 --> 01:19:16.293]  Oh, they're such amazing people.
[01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:22.477]  What a joke.
[01:19:24.238 --> 01:19:27.581]  So I got a hundred articles, and you know, I was so mad at myself today.
[01:19:29.667 --> 01:19:37.111]  When I got off the air at three o'clock, or whatever it was, and I hadn't covered all this news, and I said to the crew, hey, will you come in?
[01:19:37.131 --> 01:19:38.251]  Will you do two hours with me?
[01:19:38.692 --> 01:19:39.472]  Seven to nine.
[01:19:40.372 --> 01:19:41.673]  I'm gonna cover it all!
[01:19:42.033 --> 01:19:42.934]  I'm gonna fix it!
[01:19:42.974 --> 01:19:51.618]  And then I came in here and... I can't fix it.
[01:19:52.379 --> 01:19:53.179]  We can't fix it.
[01:19:54.019 --> 01:19:54.800]  You can't fix it.
[01:19:57.841 --> 01:19:58.882]  Only God can fix it.
[01:20:01.343 --> 01:20:02.544]  And that's what it really comes down to.
[01:20:13.249 --> 01:20:14.990]  So, here's probably what's best.
[01:20:15.791 --> 01:20:22.054]  Let me just cover a few news articles, then we'll air a few rebroadcast clips, or clips that haven't aired, then we'll just end this transmission.
[01:20:22.915 --> 01:20:26.556]  Then tomorrow we've got a nice rebroadcast for you, but that's pretty much what this comes down to.
[01:20:26.596 --> 01:20:27.296]  Let's look at this.
[01:20:27.897 --> 01:20:28.497]  Oh, here you go.
[01:20:28.977 --> 01:20:35.339]  Mainstream media cites dubious studies claiming protests didn't contribute to COVID-19 rebound.
[01:20:35.859 --> 01:20:41.621]  I mean, the double-sidedness, the oxymorons, the suspension of logic.
[01:20:42.221 --> 01:20:44.622]  Anybody protesting for an opening is bad.
[01:20:45.042 --> 01:20:48.563]  Anybody demonstrating for America or Trump is bad, but
[01:20:51.727 --> 01:20:55.848]  I have an article in the stack where they said, Black Lives Matter protest.
[01:20:57.909 --> 01:21:03.931]  A bunch of white people, nothing against white people, it's just kind of stupid, a bunch of white people saying that Black Lives Matter, it's pretty pathetic.
[01:21:04.631 --> 01:21:06.732]  Can't go out on your own and do something against the black people.
[01:21:09.542 --> 01:21:12.103]  They said it lowered.
[01:21:12.544 --> 01:21:13.044]  Look it up.
[01:21:13.844 --> 01:21:17.466]  Black Lives Matter protests lowered COVID-19.
[01:21:17.807 --> 01:21:30.233]  It's all a fraud to begin with, but think of the murder of logic where Trump supporters can't march, but COVID-19 skips over all the people that are Black Lives Matter.
[01:21:30.654 --> 01:21:32.174]  That's one article out of hundreds.
[01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:32.895]  Let's continue.
[01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:37.077]  Florida Sheriff threatens to deputize gun owners against BLM protesters.
[01:21:37.617 --> 01:21:38.438]  Very nice video.
[01:21:41.434 --> 01:21:45.875]  Hong Kong Boris Johnson promises BNO passport holders route to citizenship.
[01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:54.597]  Seattle chop zone dismantled day after occupiers threatened to raid mayor's home, her $7 million home.
[01:21:57.737 --> 01:22:04.759]  Wow, a $7 million, nothing against class, but my goodness, like a million dollar house, imagine a $7 million home.
[01:22:05.159 --> 01:22:06.619]  She's for communism though, folks.
[01:22:07.708 --> 01:22:12.951]  Seattle chop zone dismantles day after occupiers threatened to raid mayor's home.
[01:22:14.712 --> 01:22:15.233]  Armed St.
[01:22:15.273 --> 01:22:19.355]  Louis homeowners rips CNN's Chris Cuomo for being a mind reader.
[01:22:19.676 --> 01:22:22.557]  They said Trump retweeted the video because he's a racist.
[01:22:22.898 --> 01:22:25.639]  Everybody else retweeted it, but when Trump does it, it's bad.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:28.481]  Here, let's continue.
[01:22:29.735 --> 01:22:35.017]  Greece preparing to install floating barrier system to block migrant boats.
[01:22:35.777 --> 01:22:36.818]  How about you just deport them?
[01:22:37.698 --> 01:22:41.079]  That's InfoWars.com.
[01:22:46.882 --> 01:22:58.506]  Then I've got all these stacks of articles where they're openly
[01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:02.757]  Trying to bankrupt the economy and selling it as a good thing.
[01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:05.680]  The dollar's gonna die, and America's gonna die.
[01:23:06.061 --> 01:23:12.027]  And you see this, even if there was a reality to it, which there's not, it's like, this is what villains do.
[01:23:15.671 --> 01:23:20.356]  But, part of me just says, well, the public really supports this.
[01:23:21.616 --> 01:23:22.677]  We should put up with this.
[01:23:22.818 --> 01:23:24.500]  I mean, we should go along with it.
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:32.410]  I mean, if you really want your 401k or your investment or your bank account to be worthless, it's like they're begging for own destruction.
[01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:33.271]  Again, they're children.
[01:23:33.551 --> 01:23:34.032]  They don't know.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:50.583]  But that's what's so frustrating about this is, it's all so obvious.
[01:23:51.264 --> 01:23:52.024]  Look at these headlines.
[01:23:52.505 --> 01:23:56.548]  USC's record 52,000 new virus cases 24 hours, John Hopkins.
[01:23:58.069 --> 01:24:02.192]  John Hopkins is run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:24:02.472 --> 01:24:03.613]  The whole thing is a fraud.
[01:24:04.233 --> 01:24:05.014]  But again, it's them.
[01:24:07.435 --> 01:24:11.478]  Experts fear July 4th weekend will exacerbate coronavirus spread.
[01:24:11.858 --> 01:24:12.619]  Look at that right there.
[01:24:15.416 --> 01:24:20.377]  So all the other events, Black Lives Matter events, cut coronavirus.
[01:24:20.838 --> 01:24:22.078]  But July 4th is bad.
[01:24:25.499 --> 01:24:31.361]  Doctors say 4th will be a tipping point in Sacramento's fight against coronavirus.
[01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:42.824]  And then you read deeper, the deaths are way down, but the count is way up because they count people who don't have coronavirus as having coronavirus.
[01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:46.612]  What a disgusting traitor to humanity.
[01:24:46.672 --> 01:24:47.252]  And they go!
[01:25:11.052 --> 01:25:13.034]  Well, we've got record COVID cases.
[01:25:13.654 --> 01:25:20.200]  Then you look at it, and it's cases of people who they admit weren't even tested.
[01:25:21.001 --> 01:25:32.091]  They say if one person has it, 15 around them haven't, that's the sky rocketing COVID, all based on a fraud, all based on a lie.
[01:25:33.932 --> 01:25:38.196]  So I will go down in the next few days.
[01:25:42.205 --> 01:25:43.085]  And protest the governor.
[01:25:43.466 --> 01:25:46.627]  You know, in Virginia, they took down a Stonewall Jackson statue.
[01:25:47.647 --> 01:25:47.947]  Okay.
[01:25:48.828 --> 01:25:54.990]  Even British universities teach that he was a top statistician and military general.
[01:25:55.410 --> 01:25:56.451]  I was against the Civil War.
[01:25:56.791 --> 01:25:58.231]  I didn't live back then, but I've looked at it.
[01:25:58.251 --> 01:26:00.232]  The British intelligence manipulated it.
[01:26:00.912 --> 01:26:04.254]  I mean, I see both sides of the war, but okay.
[01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:06.495]  Stonewall Jackson.
[01:26:06.915 --> 01:26:10.036]  Now, Abraham Lincoln, because he wasn't good enough.
[01:26:11.698 --> 01:26:15.739]  It's all about the power of this mob to take down whatever they want.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.961]  Now a trailblazer like Abraham Lincoln isn't good enough.
[01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:26.362]  You sit back and go, that doesn't make sense.
[01:26:27.242 --> 01:26:28.282]  It's not supposed to make sense.
[01:26:28.882 --> 01:26:31.903]  Oh, there's a symbol of him freeing a black slave.
[01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:33.343]  The man's on his knees.
[01:26:33.423 --> 01:26:35.024]  He's unshackling him.
[01:26:37.064 --> 01:26:37.584]  It's canceled.
[01:26:39.285 --> 01:26:39.805]  The black
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:43.242]  Soldier Memorial in D.C.
[01:26:43.262 --> 01:26:44.383]  was attacked three weeks ago.
[01:26:47.826 --> 01:26:48.926]  That was graffitied.
[01:26:49.827 --> 01:26:50.308]  Attacked.
[01:26:50.328 --> 01:26:52.970]  Some of the heads of black soldiers cut off.
[01:26:54.571 --> 01:26:57.053]  But it's praise because it's part of the ignorance.
[01:26:59.135 --> 01:27:00.296]  It's part of the idiocy.
[01:27:01.257 --> 01:27:02.878]  It's part of destroying your birthright.
[01:27:06.681 --> 01:27:08.523]  So they cheer at Stonewall Jackson.
[01:27:11.974 --> 01:27:20.079]  Being taken down as if it's some personal power for them and they have no idea who he even was or what he did.
[01:27:26.724 --> 01:27:29.565]  And now they want other memorials.
[01:27:29.585 --> 01:27:31.106]  It just happened in Portland yesterday.
[01:27:31.126 --> 01:27:38.031]  A statue of an elk, a deer, was torn down and the media defended it.
[01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:50.673]  Because it's your basic liberty and your freedom that these corporate juggernauts want to destroy that they are targeting.
[01:27:51.874 --> 01:27:56.095]  And they believe that once they've taken control of that, there's nothing they can't do.
[01:28:01.637 --> 01:28:02.218]  Let's do this.
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:08.640]  Let's air clip eight.
[01:28:14.651 --> 01:28:16.353]  America punished for COVID defiance.
[01:28:16.373 --> 01:28:18.735]  And then let's hear clip nine.
[01:28:18.755 --> 01:28:22.639]  And the rest of the clips.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.863]  I appreciate the crew coming in tonight, and I appreciate all the work they've done.
[01:28:26.883 --> 01:28:29.246]  I'm doing the best job I can.
[01:28:30.487 --> 01:28:31.588]  We've talked about all this.
[01:28:31.608 --> 01:28:34.251]  You know, I've got a stack of news right here.
[01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:42.395]  From mainstream news, even telling you what we told you weeks ago, where they're like, yeah, we're counting regular COVID-19.
[01:28:42.675 --> 01:28:45.777]  We're counting regular cold virus or flu as COVID-19.
[01:28:45.837 --> 01:28:49.680]  And we're counting people that died of gunshot wounds as COVID-19.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.820]  And we're doing it all.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.021]  It's like, well, what does it even matter?
[01:28:53.542 --> 01:28:54.703]  Because no one cares anyways.
[01:28:55.224 --> 01:28:56.685]  You got Ron Paul coming out.
[01:28:56.705 --> 01:28:58.526]  You got Elon Musk saying it.
[01:29:00.316 --> 01:29:02.438]  You've got mainstream news admitting it's all fraudulent.
[01:29:02.458 --> 01:29:13.368]  Then we've got the screenshots where people that I know on Facebook and on Twitter cannot even share CBS news clips that it's all a fraud.
[01:29:13.688 --> 01:29:14.349]  Okay, fine.
[01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:23.257]  If that's who you are, if that's who you want to be, if everybody just thinks this is who you are, then fine.
[01:29:23.678 --> 01:29:25.159]  If you want slavery, have it.
[01:29:27.657 --> 01:29:41.166]  Doesn't matter if the Chi-Coms and major mega banks and 5G lords and GMO killers and Bill Gates control us, because if we can pull down a Robert E. Lee statue, why, we're powerful!
[01:29:42.467 --> 01:29:44.708]  I don't give a rat's ass about Robert E. Lee.
[01:29:46.409 --> 01:29:51.953]  I just know that's an example of what's falling, because if we'll put up with that, we'll put up with anything.
[01:29:55.115 --> 01:29:56.616]  So in the last 30 minutes here tonight,
[01:29:57.915 --> 01:29:58.795]  These special reports.
[01:29:58.835 --> 01:30:00.116]  The Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow.
[01:30:00.136 --> 01:30:02.296]  11 a.m.
[01:30:02.316 --> 01:30:02.617]  Central.
[01:30:02.677 --> 01:30:03.717]  I appreciate the crew coming in.
[01:30:04.677 --> 01:30:06.538]  And we've covered a lot of important information, so thank you.
[01:30:06.578 --> 01:30:07.358]  I really appreciate you.
[01:30:07.778 --> 01:30:09.559]  I appreciate the listeners and viewers for putting up with us.
[01:30:09.599 --> 01:30:10.019]  God bless you.
[01:30:10.579 --> 01:30:11.479]  All right, here's the reports.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:20.062]  My TED Talk, 90% of the views are after the pandemic one started, not before.
[01:30:20.682 --> 01:30:25.604]  The world is putting America in a quarantine.
[01:30:26.943 --> 01:30:27.363]  That's right.
[01:30:27.463 --> 01:30:28.724]  America is bad.
[01:30:28.864 --> 01:30:29.824]  Trump is bad.
[01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:31.405]  It's the American virus.
[01:30:33.046 --> 01:30:36.487]  They have tripled the testing that they were just doing a month ago.
[01:30:36.507 --> 01:30:39.449]  They've already done more testing than all other countries combined.
[01:30:39.489 --> 01:30:40.909]  That's admitted by the NIH.
[01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:44.391]  And John Hopkins, openly run by Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:51.897]  And so they're testing with a test that if you've ever had coronavirus or the flu in the last decade, you show positive.
[01:30:51.937 --> 01:30:52.458]  That's admitted.
[01:30:52.858 --> 01:30:54.400]  But the public is still so ignorant.
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:31:01.868]  There's such a blackout of censorship of real information, of medical doctors, of virologists, of university heads.
[01:31:03.479 --> 01:31:13.184]  That a lot of people know they're being lied to, but still, government is able to put this UN-controlled clampdown in because the people aren't sure what's really going on.
[01:31:13.524 --> 01:31:16.805]  Again, deaths of COVID-19 are way down.
[01:31:17.646 --> 01:31:21.788]  It is a tiny fraction of people that are dying supposedly of COVID-19.
[01:31:22.895 --> 01:31:29.182]  We now have panicked over 51 total hospitalizations in a county with eight hospitals.
[01:31:29.502 --> 01:31:30.584]  Can you people do math?
[01:31:31.084 --> 01:31:34.348]  Can you please do basic math and understand where we are on this?
[01:31:34.908 --> 01:31:36.310]  This is not a crisis.
[01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:38.573]  You, however, have created one.
[01:31:39.033 --> 01:31:46.017]  You, in an effort to try to prevent all death, but we've had 43 deaths, have now ended all relevant life.
[01:31:46.517 --> 01:31:48.539]  And you should all be ashamed of yourselves.
[01:31:48.839 --> 01:31:50.480]  And this will never be forgotten.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:51.820]  Ever be forgotten.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.023]  You will all be held accountable eventually, in this life or the next.
[01:31:56.423 --> 01:32:00.727]  You all better hope there is no hell, because when you die, that's where you're going.
[01:32:00.927 --> 01:32:01.447]  And guess what?
[01:32:01.547 --> 01:32:03.129]  You're not going to be dying of COVID either.
[01:32:03.349 --> 01:32:07.913]  This gentleman has turned off people's lights in the middle of a global health pandemic.
[01:32:08.413 --> 01:32:09.634]  That's what that gentleman did.
[01:32:09.674 --> 01:32:10.294]  Point of order.
[01:32:10.314 --> 01:32:12.476]  And you think I'm disrespectful for interrupting?
[01:32:12.536 --> 01:32:13.237]  Point of order.
[01:32:13.257 --> 01:32:16.179]  This gentleman has had the ability to do any number of things.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.881]  We could have banned large gatherings.
[01:32:17.901 --> 01:32:18.942]  We could have closed the beach.
[01:32:19.562 --> 01:32:23.524]  We could have put a moratorium on... I recessed the meeting.
[01:32:23.604 --> 01:32:26.386]  Also not within your power, and the attorney has held that that's true.
[01:32:26.406 --> 01:32:27.407]  I recessed the meeting.
[01:32:30.589 --> 01:32:39.234]  Hiding in plain view, we have seen engineers come out and test with OSHA-approved devices that the M95 supposed best mask you can have.
[01:32:40.279 --> 01:32:42.761]  is creating dangerous levels of carbon dioxide for your body.
[01:32:43.221 --> 01:32:43.981]  But it gets worse.
[01:32:44.241 --> 01:32:54.888]  On the NIH's own CDC website, it admits that the mask does not keep you from breathing out viruses or bacteria.
[01:32:56.158 --> 01:33:23.995]  And that the viruses and bacteria actually incubate in the cloth, live longer than they would, allowing it to then be spread, which is why we, one of the reasons the Blue Cities, don't just over-diagnose, don't just kill people, but they're keeping people indoors and they're wearing the mask that are weapon systems to breathe in and then to breathe out totally unfiltered air after it's incubated in the fabric.
[01:33:25.322 --> 01:33:27.244]  Or as it would, just die in seconds in the open air.
[01:33:27.785 --> 01:33:29.326]  It allows it to sit there and linger.
[01:33:30.588 --> 01:33:37.095]  And it gives people the, quote, false sense of security that a mask is protecting them when all they needed was vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc.
[01:33:37.515 --> 01:33:39.337]  You know, Bill Gates says there's too many Africans.
[01:33:39.357 --> 01:33:41.159]  That's a particular group he wants to depopulate.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:43.462]  We have him quoted on TV saying it.
[01:33:44.443 --> 01:33:47.086]  Well, guess who he wants to have the shots first?
[01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:49.909]  Like you've won the lottery.
[01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:56.652]  He wants black people in Africa, of course, and here in the US and Europe to get the shots first.
[01:33:57.012 --> 01:33:58.313]  You'll be the superstars.
[01:33:58.553 --> 01:34:03.435]  You want to do tiering in various countries to make sure your most vulnerable populations get it.
[01:34:04.435 --> 01:34:10.618]  In our country, that would be blacks and Native Americans, people with underlying health conditions, and the elderly.
[01:34:10.998 --> 01:34:15.240]  And so we need to look at, as a globe, and we're involved with many European leaders,
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.662]  And African leaders and others in Southeast Asia.
[01:34:19.202 --> 01:34:33.190]  And you'll be able to then go out in public and have your little digital ID on your phone showing you're a good citizen and you're gonna get rewards and all sorts of little freebies because you were good and took the special shot he's got for you.
[01:34:52.649 --> 01:34:54.911]  What is the most popular thing in the world?
[01:34:57.434 --> 01:34:57.874]  Music.
[01:34:59.176 --> 01:34:59.436]  No.
[01:35:00.777 --> 01:35:01.117]  Tell me.
[01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:02.339]  Ice cream.
[01:35:02.899 --> 01:35:03.300]  Okay.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:06.963]  Sacha Baron Cohen is fun.
[01:35:07.604 --> 01:35:09.406]  I mean, he's done some good skits.
[01:35:09.746 --> 01:35:11.347]  And I'm all about edgy comedy.
[01:35:11.828 --> 01:35:15.692]  But you can't call for censorship and a shutdown of free speech.
[01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:18.005]  I don't
[01:35:39.181 --> 01:35:43.785]  He wouldn't make eye contact with me, and you have to understand in the gun business, we pay attention to people.
[01:35:44.165 --> 01:35:50.671]  I'm talking to you, you're going to tell me, so this way I know what you're looking to get and what you're looking to purchase.
[01:35:51.271 --> 01:35:52.753]  He kept looking at the producers.
[01:35:53.093 --> 01:35:57.597]  As soon as I kept trying to make eye contact with him, I was like, yeah, you're a borat.
[01:35:58.357 --> 01:36:01.160]  As soon as I said that, you can see in the video, he took off.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:06.603]  Hate crimes are surging as are murderous attacks on religious and ethnic minorities.
[01:36:07.184 --> 01:36:10.386]  Now what do all these dangerous trends have in common?
[01:36:10.946 --> 01:36:16.310]  I'm just a comedian and an actor, I'm not a scholar, but one thing is pretty clear to me.
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:27.187]  All this hate and violence is being facilitated by a handful of internet companies that amount to the greatest propaganda machine in history.
[01:36:27.647 --> 01:36:34.812]  And so last year, he had this big speech, arrest big tech heads that don't let the ADL censor everybody and get rid of free speech.
[01:36:34.892 --> 01:36:42.177]  But then he goes to an event and tells the locals, oh, I'm going to pay for a soundstage for you with a Reopen America rally.
[01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:43.438]  He goes there.
[01:36:43.458 --> 01:36:44.478]  He has armed guards.
[01:36:45.419 --> 01:36:47.000]  He gets up and starts saying racist stuff.
[01:36:47.281 --> 01:36:51.103]  They run up and battle armed dudes to unplug the microphone.
[01:36:51.784 --> 01:36:58.629]  And the media says, oh, Sacha Baron Cohen went to a white supremacist rally and they got mad that they were saying racist stuff.
[01:36:58.789 --> 01:37:00.371]  I mean, he set them up.
[01:37:00.451 --> 01:37:01.191]  He lied.
[01:37:01.511 --> 01:37:02.352]  He got caught.
[01:37:02.372 --> 01:37:11.379]  And then they are in the news saying, oh, Sacha Baron Cohen pulls epic prank on far-right event, The Daily Beast.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:12.600]  This is sick.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:14.642]  He lives behind the First Amendment.
[01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:21.744]  And then he goes to the ADL and gives speeches on C-SPAN saying, arrest people for their speech.
[01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:40.798]  Well, the second band started playing their set, and about halfway into a set, or where I'd expect them to be about done, they started into an incredibly racist song.
[01:37:41.418 --> 01:37:44.741]  At that moment, we realized that our organizers were nowhere to be found.
[01:37:44.761 --> 01:37:46.643]  The ones that had contracted and paid for stuff.
[01:37:47.504 --> 01:37:49.505]  As one of the organizers we tried to pull the plug.
[01:37:49.525 --> 01:37:53.848]  They had four armed security on the generator so we couldn't even cut the power.
[01:37:54.329 --> 01:37:56.230]  We tried to get on the stage to kick the band off.
[01:37:56.990 --> 01:38:02.954]  They had all of the security that was around the stage was then blocking us from getting access to the stage.
[01:38:02.974 --> 01:38:07.117]  They wouldn't let us pass the barriers despite us having our backstage passes that were issued to us.
[01:38:07.957 --> 01:38:08.618]  All of the security
[01:38:09.558 --> 01:38:10.119]  Turned on us.
[01:38:10.539 --> 01:38:16.043]  We bum-rushed them, got through the security, unplugged the mic, got the guy off the stage.
[01:38:16.404 --> 01:38:22.008]  They jumped into the staged AMR ambulance back here and took off with lights and sirens on to get out of here.
[01:38:22.308 --> 01:38:26.252]  They run and try to unplug it and dudes with guns are like stopping them.
[01:38:26.432 --> 01:38:28.854]  So Cohen's like, no, I'm gonna say this in your name!
[01:38:30.034 --> 01:38:33.335]  He does that classic thing, like, oh, let's arrest Fauci, let's arrest Bill Gates.
[01:38:33.755 --> 01:38:37.296]  Then he starts, like, mixing in, oh, let's bomb China with nukes.
[01:38:37.977 --> 01:38:42.798]  When the public doesn't buy it, men with guns stop them so he can frame them.
[01:38:43.439 --> 01:38:45.399]  The man is a monster.
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:56.543]  Hey, folks, me and the men and women of the Clay County Sheriff's Office just want to weigh in on what we're seeing going on, played out across the media or mainstream media in this country.
[01:38:57.984 --> 01:39:13.033]  Look folks, don't fall victim to subjecting yourselves to this conversation that law enforcement is bad, that law enforcement is the enemy of the citizens that we're sworn to protect and serve.
[01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:14.834]  We swore an oath.
[01:39:16.095 --> 01:39:23.580]  And in that oath, we swore to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States and the government.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:29.582]  And that we're duly qualified under the state's constitution to hold office.
[01:39:30.282 --> 01:39:33.643]  That is for me as a sheriff and for these men and women as deputy sheriffs.
[01:39:34.243 --> 01:39:37.104]  And we end that with, so help me God.
[01:39:38.004 --> 01:39:48.568]  But God is absent from the media's message or Black Lives Matter or any other group out there that's making themselves a spectacle.
[01:39:49.491 --> 01:39:52.552]  Disrupting what we know to be our quality of life in this country.
[01:39:53.312 --> 01:39:55.292]  In Clay County, we have a great quality of life.
[01:39:55.752 --> 01:39:57.733]  We have a great relationship with our community.
[01:39:58.373 --> 01:40:00.074]  But across this country, not so much.
[01:40:01.114 --> 01:40:05.735]  I just wanted to take a stand with these men and with these women who feel the same way that I do.
[01:40:06.075 --> 01:40:08.636]  Lawlessness, that's unacceptable in this country.
[01:40:09.236 --> 01:40:11.396]  Lawlessness, that's unacceptable in Clay County.
[01:40:11.976 --> 01:40:18.778]  And if you threaten to come to Clay County and think that for one second that we'll bend our backs for you, you're sadly mistaken.
[01:40:20.057 --> 01:40:23.038]  I know what happens when lawlessness prevails.
[01:40:23.958 --> 01:40:37.362]  And in this day and time, God is raising up men and women, just like the folks you see standing behind me, who will have strong backbones and will stand in the gap between lawlessness and the good citizenry that we're sworn to protect and serve.
[01:40:38.459 --> 01:40:40.281]  So you can threat all you want.
[01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:58.116]  You can say, hey, let's go to Clay County or let's go to some other peaceful county where their problems don't exist or not so much like across this country where relationships are great and not strained and where the people support their sheriff and support the men and women who wear the uniform.
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:01.521]  And you'll have something waiting on you that you don't want.
[01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:09.747]  Yes, we'll protect your constitutional rights as long as you remain under the umbrella of peaceful protest or peaceful march.
[01:41:10.728 --> 01:41:16.051]  But the second that you step out from up under the protection of the Constitution, we'll be waiting on you.
[01:41:16.712 --> 01:41:17.913]  And we'll give you everything you want.
[01:41:18.453 --> 01:41:25.518]  All the publicity, all the pain, all the glamour and glory for all that five minutes will give you.
[01:41:26.565 --> 01:41:27.165]  Is it a threat?
[01:41:27.326 --> 01:41:28.246]  Absolutely not.
[01:41:28.786 --> 01:41:32.969]  But somebody has to step up in front of the camera and say, enough is enough.
[01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:35.250]  Tearing up Clay County?
[01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:36.471]  That's not going to be acceptable.
[01:41:37.426 --> 01:41:39.547]  And if we can't handle you, you know what I'll do?
[01:41:39.867 --> 01:41:47.590]  I'll exercise the power and authority as a sheriff, and I'll make special deputies of every lawful gun owner in this county.
[01:41:48.251 --> 01:41:54.073]  And I'll deputize them for this one purpose, to stand in the gap between lawlessness and civility.
[01:41:54.693 --> 01:41:57.114]  That's what we're sworn to do, and that's what we're gonna do.
[01:41:58.435 --> 01:41:58.995]  You've been warned.
[01:42:13.024 --> 01:42:14.986]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[01:42:15.166 --> 01:42:19.851]  We spent an awful lot of time this spring talking about viruses and how they spread.
[01:42:20.491 --> 01:42:30.621]  One person infects another person, who infects a third, who then has contact with a larger group of people and infects 20 more, each of whom, and you know how it works, it's exponential.
[01:42:31.222 --> 01:42:35.826]  Pretty soon, individuals thousands of miles from the source of the outbreak start getting sick.
[01:42:36.647 --> 01:42:40.551]  Well, we now know that craziness spreads very much the same way.
[01:42:41.151 --> 01:42:49.538]  A single lunatic can pass a debilitating case of it to millions of others with just one appearance on MSNBC or a long thread on Twitter.
[01:42:50.279 --> 01:42:56.504]  Hysteria is the most communicable disease known to man, and we're now living through a pandemic of it.
[01:42:57.245 --> 01:43:01.711]  A Memorial Day weekend, a man called George Floyd died in police custody in Minnesota.
[01:43:01.731 --> 01:43:03.413]  That's where this outbreak first began.
[01:43:03.814 --> 01:43:05.336]  Minneapolis was our Wuhan.
[01:43:05.897 --> 01:43:08.260]  The first cases appeared a little over a month ago.
[01:43:08.841 --> 01:43:10.222]  Here's the state of the pandemic now.
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:20.002]  It was just before midnight Thursday when protesters began dismantling and toppling the statue honoring Christopher Columbus in Civic Center Park.
[01:43:20.362 --> 01:43:24.503]  Crews moved in and destroyed what was left.
[01:43:25.063 --> 01:43:38.426]  One protester climbing up the statue and began spray-painting its face and hands, possibly symbolizing blood, while others spray-painted the words George Floyd, BLM for Black Lives Matter, and the communist symbol.
[01:43:44.696 --> 01:43:48.921]  And they have just torn down this statue of Christopher Columbus.
[01:43:49.321 --> 01:43:52.024]  The statue has been here since 1931.
[01:43:52.444 --> 01:44:00.713]  So to translate what you just saw into the clinical language of epidemiology, holy smokes, this is getting really crazy.
[01:44:01.494 --> 01:44:04.617]  What does Christopher Columbus have to do with George Floyd?
[01:44:04.957 --> 01:44:07.720]  Christopher Columbus was not a Minneapolis police officer.
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:13.025]  Christopher Columbus was an Italian navigator who died more than 500 years ago.
[01:44:13.446 --> 01:44:16.048]  Columbus probably never even heard of George Floyd.
[01:44:16.369 --> 01:44:18.751]  He almost certainly didn't mistreat him personally.
[01:44:19.392 --> 01:44:22.274]  So why are people attacking Columbus's statues?
[01:44:22.955 --> 01:44:23.675]  Well, who knows?
[01:44:24.035 --> 01:44:25.736]  You're definitely not allowed to ask.
[01:44:26.156 --> 01:44:29.337]  Questions are not permitted during hysteria epidemics.
[01:44:29.718 --> 01:44:33.519]  Logic of any kind seems to dramatically increase the severity of the symptoms.
[01:44:34.039 --> 01:44:44.523]  A patient may appear to be recovering from hysteria, speaking in nearly complete sentences, bathing independently on occasion, but then a single direct question will send him into a tailspin.
[01:44:45.023 --> 01:44:51.186]  A renewed attack of slogans shouting, anarchist graffiti, hours of hostile tweeting, the disease back in force.
[01:44:51.971 --> 01:44:53.152]  It's safer not to say a word.
[01:44:54.133 --> 01:44:58.176]  That's definitely the policy over at the Senate Republican Conference on Capitol Hill.
[01:44:58.657 --> 01:45:05.863]  Republican senators have decided not to disturb the patience in any way, even as they rampage through America, destroying our culture and history.
[01:45:06.303 --> 01:45:08.565]  It's easier to give them what they want, so that's what they're doing.
[01:45:09.346 --> 01:45:13.649]  Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and James Langford of Oklahoma are both Republican senators.
[01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:17.371]  Today they introduced legislation to abolish Columbus Day.
[01:45:17.651 --> 01:45:21.894]  They want to delete it from the national calendar and replace it with Juneteenth.
[01:45:22.534 --> 01:45:23.455]  This is a big change.
[01:45:23.975 --> 01:45:27.678]  Americans have celebrated Columbus Day as long as we have had a country since 1792.
[01:45:28.999 --> 01:45:31.780]  Columbus Day is a celebration of the nation itself.
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:33.802]  That's why it's a national holiday.
[01:45:34.693 --> 01:45:35.674]  Juneteenth is newer.
[01:45:36.134 --> 01:45:37.915]  Three weeks ago, many people had never heard of it.
[01:45:38.475 --> 01:45:41.177]  Even the media seemed oblivious to its existence.
[01:45:41.738 --> 01:45:49.543]  From 2012 through 2017, CNN did not mention the word Juneteenth a single time on the air.
[01:45:50.203 --> 01:45:56.607]  Barack Obama, who was the president, never tweeted about Juneteenth once during the entire span of his presidency.
[01:45:56.647 --> 01:45:57.288]  Not one time.
[01:45:58.410 --> 01:46:01.051]  Juneteenth commemorates the freeing of the American slaves.
[01:46:01.091 --> 01:46:04.833]  Emancipation is one of the great moments in America's history.
[01:46:04.853 --> 01:46:06.894]  It's why we consider Abraham Lincoln a hero.
[01:46:07.754 --> 01:46:15.418]  But paradoxically, and this is odd, the people who are pushing Juneteenth on the country do not consider Abraham Lincoln a hero.
[01:46:15.438 --> 01:46:17.679]  They're pulling down his statues along with Columbus's.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:18.980]  Confused?
[01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:22.141]  Well, that's the nature of a hysteria outbreak.
[01:46:22.161 --> 01:46:22.862]  Nothing makes sense.
[01:46:23.686 --> 01:46:26.267]  Senators Johnson and Lankford may be a little confused as well.
[01:46:26.307 --> 01:46:30.469]  They describe themselves as conservatives, improbable as that may seem.
[01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:38.113]  On some level, they may suspect that all the yelling about Columbus Day and Juneteenth doesn't really have much to do with emancipation or civil rights.
[01:46:38.493 --> 01:46:41.915]  More likely, it's just another way to humiliate and demoralize Americans.
[01:46:42.395 --> 01:46:44.816]  On some level, they know that, but they're ignoring it.
[01:46:44.957 --> 01:46:47.318]  It's just easier to do with the hysteria patients command.
[01:46:48.197 --> 01:46:51.220]  Unless, of course, their voters notice them doing it.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:56.624]  A couple of weeks ago, Senator Mike Braun of Indiana sponsored a bill designed to punish the police.
[01:46:57.125 --> 01:47:01.168]  At the very moment, the country was undergoing widespread looting, arson, and violence, rioting.
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:06.141]  Then Braun endorsed the radical racial separatist BLM movement.
[01:47:06.941 --> 01:47:12.083]  At first, Braun's Republican constituents didn't seem to realize their senator had done any of this.
[01:47:12.763 --> 01:47:15.324]  But when they found out, they were enraged.
[01:47:15.424 --> 01:47:17.165]  And they let him know about it, loudly.
[01:47:17.545 --> 01:47:20.065]  Mike Braun is now running away from his own bill.
[01:47:20.586 --> 01:47:23.446]  If Mike Braun were up for election this year, he would lose.
[01:47:24.627 --> 01:47:28.208]  Senators Lankford and Johnson are praying nothing like that will happen to them.
[01:47:29.161 --> 01:47:36.166]  They're hoping to quietly eliminate Columbus Day and then move on to the next item on the Riders' list of demands.
[01:47:36.766 --> 01:47:37.927]  Will they be able to do that?
[01:47:38.647 --> 01:47:43.810]  It all depends on whether or not you let them know that you noticed they're trying to cancel Columbus Day.
[01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:48.814]  If you don't say anything about it, there is no telling what Johnson and Lankford might do next.
[01:47:49.741 --> 01:47:58.168]  Just the other day, for example, the New York Times ran a piece suggesting that we knock down George Washington statues and purge our country's founder from our collective memory.
[01:47:58.788 --> 01:48:04.713]  Today, the paper announced that we should consider closing Mount Rushmore because, of course, racism.
[01:48:05.654 --> 01:48:08.596]  Senators Johnson and Lankford have not yet endorsed those ideas.
[01:48:08.676 --> 01:48:10.478]  At this rate, it may not be long before they do.
[01:48:11.078 --> 01:48:18.184]  So the question is, what other acts of revolution and cultural desecration can we expect from our suddenly woke Republican senator friends?
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:20.321]  That's a good question.
[01:48:39.517 --> 01:48:51.752]  Nursing home murders, asymptomatic cases spiking with more testing, false positives, and mandatory masks that do nothing to protect us and only prepare us for more tyranny.
[01:48:52.553 --> 01:48:56.939]  President Trump, it is time to destroy the enemy or be destroyed.
[01:49:00.905 --> 01:49:17.849]  I've been all over the country, and I talked to people, again, on the ground, and almost unanimously, they know that almost all of the people that died of shotgun wounds and car wrecks and cancer and pneumonia and the flu have been put in the COVID-19 column.
[01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:23.190]  That is incredibly outrageous, and it's just something that's a blip on the radar screen.
[01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:25.551]  Mr. President, you have to come out.
[01:49:25.931 --> 01:49:27.191]  You have to expose that.
[01:49:27.911 --> 01:49:35.313]  I know that you didn't realize that Bill Gates basically owns the NIH and Fauci, and you thought surely the doctors wouldn't be political.
[01:49:35.853 --> 01:49:40.535]  But historically, they're some of the most political people out there with the corruption of big pharma.
[01:49:41.255 --> 01:49:44.636]  And from day one, Fauci and Gates have been financing the Wuhan lab.
[01:49:44.976 --> 01:49:51.058]  That's why the Pentagon tells you, oh, don't blame China, even though we know it came out of China, because it implicates the deep state.
[01:49:52.079 --> 01:49:54.641]  That's not your fault the Deep State was in your administration.
[01:49:55.221 --> 01:49:57.623]  The American people can tell one from the other.
[01:49:57.903 --> 01:49:58.884]  You have to burn them.
[01:49:59.645 --> 01:50:00.966]  You have to come out and expose.
[01:50:01.026 --> 01:50:02.487]  Even Newsweek's run the headline.
[01:50:02.667 --> 01:50:16.498]  Because it's true that Fauci ran most of the research at Wuhan, including weaponized coronavirus research in bats with gain-of-function transmission to humans.
[01:50:16.898 --> 01:50:17.278]  COVID-19.
[01:50:18.928 --> 01:50:24.870]  ...was estimated to kill 22 to 25 times more people than it actually did.
[01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:28.991]  In fact, some numbers, they were saying 50, 60, 100 times more were gonna die.
[01:50:29.251 --> 01:50:42.175]  We were told 2.2 million, 2.5 million in all of these Bill Gates-financed operations, and now it's 110,000, and most of those are people they killed in nursing homes or people that died of something else they put in a column.
[01:50:42.495 --> 01:50:54.557]  In event 201, hosted by Bill and Melinda Gates and John Hopkins University, they laid this all out in October and November of last year as a tabletop exercise for what they've now implemented.
[01:50:55.098 --> 01:50:56.298]  Yes, it's a real virus.
[01:50:56.398 --> 01:51:01.299]  Yes, it's patented and man-made so they can own all the medical responses to it.
[01:51:01.679 --> 01:51:06.520]  They could never patent a regular cold or flu virus before because it was natural.
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:12.061]  But now they've got something they can own and something they can force us to accept contact tracing
[01:51:12.601 --> 01:51:29.652]  And of course, it's not just Bill and Melinda Gates, but the Clintons and their global initiative are on record, running the program with Bill Gates, with Chelsea on the board, and Bill Clinton out promoting it, that they will be tracking everybody in America via these apps.
[01:51:30.052 --> 01:51:32.074]  They sent in 10 blue states.
[01:51:33.055 --> 01:51:33.235]  Yeah.
[01:51:53.371 --> 01:52:03.882]  The NIH getting orders from the UN and the WHO did, which you've cut the funding to and you've stopped their management and you've canceled their briefings where they put out this information.
[01:52:05.003 --> 01:52:06.285]  You obviously know what's going on.
[01:52:06.385 --> 01:52:09.868]  You've done the right things behind the scenes, but you've got to come out.
[01:52:10.674 --> 01:52:10.834]  I think?
[01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:42.566]  They were ordering them to intubate people who weren't even sick, who tested positive for COVID-19, because they were getting an additional $40,000-plus every time they did it.
[01:52:42.766 --> 01:52:44.847]  It totaled $52,000 altogether.
[01:52:45.087 --> 01:52:46.607]  So that's a bounty on their heads.
[01:52:46.928 --> 01:52:54.531]  Another one of the huge COVID-19 frauds that's, again, on record, not debated, it's just not being put front and center, is that COVID deaths have gone way down.
[01:52:55.831 --> 01:53:08.357]  Because the fraud's been exposed, but COVID positives have gone way up because they're testing more and more people, and because the tests have, again, been ruled to be causing all these false positives.
[01:53:08.657 --> 01:53:16.481]  Especially the non-antibody test that just finds the detritus or the remnants of a previous viral infection that isn't even COVID-19.
[01:53:17.041 --> 01:53:20.423]  You can go up there with the medical research and show that information.
[01:53:20.683 --> 01:53:27.971]  And then they get mad at Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas, because he says, I've been tested, I don't have COVID-19, I'm not wearing a mask.
[01:53:28.291 --> 01:53:29.973]  If he doesn't have it, why should you wear a mask?
[01:53:30.213 --> 01:53:31.074]  That's normal medicine.
[01:53:31.254 --> 01:53:32.616]  You're the sick one, you wear the mask.
[01:53:33.016 --> 01:53:33.317]  But no.
[01:53:34.329 --> 01:53:38.032]  They responded by, you still can have it, you gotta wear a mask to keep people safe.
[01:53:38.412 --> 01:53:52.081]  But the M95 mask that's recommended and pushed by the NIH only stops air coming in and releases air coming out in a valve and so does not reduce the virus at all and again is a giant fraud.
[01:53:52.702 --> 01:53:55.724]  Hoaxes on top of hoaxes on top of hoaxes.
[01:53:56.084 --> 01:53:59.787]  And just like a bunch of bowling pins, we need you to line up
[01:54:01.056 --> 01:54:05.461]  Throw that bowling ball and hit a strike and knock them all out at once.
[01:54:05.861 --> 01:54:12.028]  It is the fault of the bureaucrats that are the true deep state, the medical tyranny that did this.
[01:54:12.388 --> 01:54:21.117]  And by exposing them and breaking with them, you can destroy them, expose the whole COVID hoax, win re-election, and keep America great.
[01:54:21.878 --> 01:54:23.779]  If you don't, we're going to go into total depression.
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:26.481]  If there's more rounds of bailouts, we're going to go into a depression.
[01:54:26.801 --> 01:54:30.204]  Your own advisors, like Kudlow and others, are telling you this properly.
[01:54:30.724 --> 01:54:37.389]  So, if you again do not move against these people and flamethrow them with the truth, only 100% truth will do it,
[01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:41.471]  Then you're going to lose and America's going in to an engineered civil war.
[01:54:41.891 --> 01:54:44.933]  The New York Times is bragging that the virus won.
[01:54:45.353 --> 01:54:52.318]  Other publications are saying that the United States is the epicenter and needs to be quarantined and that we're criminals and that America's over.
[01:54:52.978 --> 01:54:55.980]  They're openly celebrating this entire fraud.
[01:54:57.005 --> 01:55:00.327]  They're openly celebrating what they hope is the destruction of our republic.
[01:55:01.007 --> 01:55:02.407]  It's us or them, President Trump.
[01:55:03.208 --> 01:55:11.272]  I know when the chips are down, you're going to stand up and decisively expose these criminals and call them out for how they're openly engineering this to bring down our republic.
[01:55:11.912 --> 01:55:13.893]  It's us or them, President Trump.
[01:55:14.313 --> 01:55:15.433]  Burn them down politically.
[01:55:15.794 --> 01:55:16.594]  Destroy them.
[01:55:17.634 --> 01:55:22.797]  Or go along with national suicide and aid and abet the enemies of this republic.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:27.001]  As for me and our viewers and listeners, we're going to continue to fight on.
[01:55:27.682 --> 01:55:30.263]  And deep down I know, you're going to do the right thing.
[01:55:33.745 --> 01:55:41.208]  Well, Reddit has come out with an article accusing yours truly of faking bullet holes in our armored vehicle.
[01:55:42.179 --> 01:55:44.640]  The truth is, it was all caught on video.
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:46.161]  It was another giant Reddit post.
[01:55:46.401 --> 01:55:47.282]  It was all over the internet.
[01:55:47.322 --> 01:55:57.247]  It made national news a few weeks ago when Black Lives Matter slash Antifa brutally attacked our vehicle with a hammer and with a whole bunch of other objects.
[01:55:57.587 --> 01:55:58.707]  It's all on video.
[01:55:58.867 --> 01:56:00.268]  We're going to show it to you right now.
[01:56:00.748 --> 01:56:01.329]  They know!
[01:56:02.301 --> 01:56:13.230]  That these aren't bullet holes and that these are hammer attack points, but they put it in a story claiming that I'm a fraud, when in truth, they are the ones that are frauds and are actually owned by the Communist Chinese.
[01:56:18.513 --> 01:56:26.317]  What I'm about to break down is a very important case of communist Chinese espionage right here in the United States.
[01:56:27.017 --> 01:56:35.142]  And it deals with Reddit that has been quietly bought out in a series of payments totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in the last year and a half.
[01:56:35.962 --> 01:56:46.206]  Now, the Justice Department is looking at Reddit, I can exclusively tell you, and at other media companies that are heavily invested in or covertly owned by Communist China.
[01:56:46.906 --> 01:56:50.167]  So that's the most important part of the story, and I'll get to that in a moment.
[01:56:50.647 --> 01:56:54.048]  But first, let's zoom in to the propaganda at Reddit.
[01:56:54.509 --> 01:56:57.690]  It's banned the Donald site, one of Trump's biggest fan sites.
[01:56:57.750 --> 01:57:00.511]  It's banned thousands of other subreddits.
[01:57:01.391 --> 01:57:05.435]  That were some of the most popular areas that got our populist president elected.
[01:57:06.235 --> 01:57:13.442]  And every story now that is in Reddit is tailored by propagandists to be anti-American and incredibly deceptive.
[01:57:13.622 --> 01:57:16.705]  So let me just give you one example of what happened to InfoWars this weekend.
[01:57:17.861 --> 01:57:21.483]  The Post has had hundreds of thousands of views, hundreds and hundreds of posters.
[01:57:21.883 --> 01:57:31.248]  It links the Austin American Statesman story about how I went down this last Sunday and protested the mandatory mass garbage at the state capitol.
[01:57:31.788 --> 01:57:34.850]  And it says, out of the gates, Jones is a fraud.
[01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:36.211]  Jones is a fake.
[01:57:36.631 --> 01:57:38.052]  He has fake bullet holes.
[01:57:38.872 --> 01:57:44.516]  In the armored glass of his armored truck, his son had a canned speech and it's fake.
[01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:47.058]  And it was all a photo op for Jones.
[01:57:47.138 --> 01:57:48.640]  And that's the message they put out.
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:49.760]  Alex Jones is fake.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:50.581]  Trump is fake.
[01:57:50.681 --> 01:57:51.502]  America is fake.
[01:57:52.062 --> 01:57:55.104]  And if you look at the Reddit post about nationalists, conservatives, populists...
[01:57:56.025 --> 01:58:00.327]  It's all demonizing people saying they're frauds, saying the president is a fraud.
[01:58:00.627 --> 01:58:06.450]  And since the Chinese covertly bought Reddit a year ago, all of these characteristics are there in every story.
[01:58:06.490 --> 01:58:11.892]  They're given talking points about how they're supposed to attack loyal Americans, and it's truly disgusting.
[01:58:11.932 --> 01:58:17.295]  When you read the so-called article, it is a tissue of lies and fraud.
[01:58:18.495 --> 01:58:19.796]  That is just a microcosm.
[01:58:21.047 --> 01:58:30.099]  Australia has now passed a law to not let communist Chinese companies buy up their media and their industry because they were trying to take control of the country.
[01:58:31.306 --> 01:58:32.767]  Same thing just happened in India.
[01:58:33.247 --> 01:58:37.809]  They've now passed laws where the Chinese can't come in and buy up their media or other critical infrastructure.
[01:58:38.369 --> 01:58:40.670]  And I can tell you the Justice Department is looking at this right now.
[01:58:40.970 --> 01:58:49.514]  I told you a year before it happened that the Confucius Institutes, billions a year funded by the Communist Chinese, were buying off the university faculty.
[01:58:49.814 --> 01:58:50.775]  Now they've been outlawed.
[01:58:51.295 --> 01:59:05.763]  And I'm telling you next, Reddit could very easily see the FBI raid them and get into their files because the evidence is already known that communist Chinese government itself, through a subcompany, is directing Reddit.
[01:59:05.783 --> 01:59:13.268]  So this is an example of the espionage against the American people and the propaganda against our nation of the big six.
[01:59:14.673 --> 01:59:18.656]  Hollywood production companies, four are totally controlled and owned by the Communist Chinese.
[01:59:18.916 --> 01:59:19.817]  The other two are partially.
[01:59:20.358 --> 01:59:24.561]  And even subgroups like American Bandstand, they tried to buy, but Trump blocked that.
[01:59:25.061 --> 01:59:31.046]  So they've bought up thousands of media companies, ladies and gentlemen, and they are pushing the race war narrative in this country.
[01:59:31.486 --> 01:59:42.095]  Now, a lot of the people that posted Reddit, they don't even pay to do it, but they are allowed to promote their own agenda if they go along with the anti-American agenda.
[01:59:42.335 --> 01:59:43.216]  And so this is where
[01:59:43.856 --> 01:59:47.899]  They are basically engaging in Benedict Arnold type activity.
[01:59:47.939 --> 01:59:52.722]  But we already know the Democrats have openly said no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:59:53.203 --> 01:59:54.223]  They hate this country.
[01:59:54.243 --> 02:00:00.267]  They're trying to ban the 4th of July and the American flag and pulling down George Washington and Lincoln memorials.
[02:00:00.928 --> 02:00:04.650]  These people are involved in a globalist takeover.
[02:00:05.070 --> 02:00:08.493]  Major universities are announcing that if you don't pledge to Black Lives Matter,
[02:00:23.287 --> 02:00:27.351]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[02:00:27.371 --> 02:00:28.692]  Where did it come from?
