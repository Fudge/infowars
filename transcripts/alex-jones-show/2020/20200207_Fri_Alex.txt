[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:05.831]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:12.413]  We first went through Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:16.555]  It was all bullshit.
[00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:20.016]  We then went through the Mueller Report.
[00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.137]  And they should have come back one day later.
[00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:24.597]  They didn't.
[00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:31.503]  They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money.
[00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:39.951]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday transmission.
[00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:43.514]  And we have a very special
[00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:49.826]  Yes, joining us, but I'm gonna go to rebroadcast for a little while.
[00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:56.755]  We got some information I got to work on, and then I'm gonna come back with all this breaking news and information today, okay?
[00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:03.825]  And I have Dr. Francis Boyle, creator of the Bioweapons Act, says coronavirus is biological warfare weapon.
[00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.913]  And he's got in-depth intel that's breaking that no one else has.
[00:01:10.994 --> 00:01:17.198]  And you know, this type of person has a lot of big contacts at the United Nations and worldwide.
[00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.521]  He was also Slobodan Milosevic's lawyer.
[00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:23.583]  Let me just give you an idea of the people he's connected to.
[00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:26.206]  And he's taking off
[00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.971]  Teaching as a law professor today to give us exclusive information.
[00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:37.794]  He sent us a whole bunch of notes and intel that we're gonna be going over here.
[00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:40.155]  But I'm gonna just go to break here for a moment.
[00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:41.816]  I'm gonna restart the transmission.
[00:01:43.177 --> 00:01:46.518]  After we come back from break, we're gonna play this report.
[00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.159]  Clip one.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.682]  Wuhan coronavirus kills doctor who warned of outbreak.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.221]  Here it is.
[00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:59.604]  Dr. Li Wenliang went from treating patients to becoming one.
[00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:08.593]  The 34-year-old ophthalmologist diagnosed Saturday with the Wuhan coronavirus, dying less than a week later in the same hospital in which he worked.
[00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:16.521]  But if action had been taken when he and others started sounding alarms, the severity of the outbreak might have been understood sooner.
[00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:22.321]  Struggling to communicate, Lee spoke with CNN briefly by phone on January 31st.
[00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:25.647]  You could hear the hospital machines pulsing in the background.
[00:02:31.337 --> 00:02:36.843]  It was back in late December when Lee first warned friends on WeChat about a SARS-like disease going around.
[00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:44.712]  Lee sent a group message saying that a test result from a patient quarantined at the hospital where he worked showed a patient had a coronavirus.
[00:02:44.973 --> 00:02:51.100]  But hours after hitting send, Wuhan City health officials tracked Lee down, questioning where he got the information.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.023]  Within days, they closed the suspected source of the virus, the seafood market.
[00:02:56.423 --> 00:02:57.604]  And they announced the outbreak.
[00:02:57.964 --> 00:03:01.546]  But instead of being praised, Lee got a call from Wuhan City Police.
[00:03:02.627 --> 00:03:07.570]  With Lee coughing too much and breathing too poorly to speak by phone, we asked Lee by text.
[00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.291]  How did you feel when this happened?
[00:03:09.771 --> 00:03:10.892]  I felt a little afraid.
[00:03:11.072 --> 00:03:12.192]  Afraid I would be detained.
[00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.394]  Afraid my family would worry, Lee responded.
[00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:21.781]  He agreed to sign this document admitting to spreading rumors online and severely disrupting social order.
[00:03:22.161 --> 00:03:27.183]  It reads, we want you to cooperate with the police and listen to our reminder and stop the illegal act.
[00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:28.104]  Can you do that?
[00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:29.925]  Lee answered, yes I can.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:43.255]  In the weeks that followed, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission maintained that there was no obvious evidence for human-to-human transmission, no infection of healthcare workers, and that the outbreak was, in their words, preventable and controllable.
[00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:47.019]  And with that, the people of Wuhan continued about their normal lives.
[00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:50.176]  Then came a sudden jump in infections.
[00:03:50.857 --> 00:03:56.080]  China's central government took over, scrambling to contain a spreading virus with a rising death toll.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.203]  Chinese state media first reported that Li was one of several whistleblowers silenced by police.
[00:04:01.223 --> 00:04:03.624]  And that's Wee Lin Lang, who's dead.
[00:04:03.664 --> 00:04:10.248]  Now there's massive demonstrations all over China, all over Hong Kong, and all over Taiwan, because the government tried to cover it up.
[00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:12.530]  And we know it's the same global policy worldwide.
[00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.651]  This thing is spreading to millions.
[00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:17.592]  I'm predicting it's killed thousands and thousands.
[00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:19.312]  It is a bioweapon.
[00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:21.873]  We have all the evidence and there's a big cover-up going on.
[00:04:22.654 --> 00:04:25.475]  And so people better get ready and they better get serious.
[00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:26.955]  Now, here's the bad news.
[00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.897]  It affects Asians mainly and there's a lot of Asians.
[00:04:31.157 --> 00:04:32.317]  We feel sorry for those folks.
[00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:40.901]  The good news is that most other groups of people do not even have the receptors for this.
[00:04:42.102 --> 00:04:44.463]  And so, it is a race-specific bioweapon.
[00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:48.785]  Now, why the hell would the Chinese release a bioweapon on themselves?
[00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:50.405]  Well, they've actually talked about doing it before.
[00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:53.707]  They had a one-child policy and killed 50 million-plus girls.
[00:04:57.108 --> 00:04:59.989]  And here we are, already Friday, February 7, 2020.
[00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:04.636]  What does that year roll off the tongue?
[00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:09.918]  And we're only 269 days out from the historic election.
[00:05:10.718 --> 00:05:13.299]  Now I have all of this ultra-massive news in front of me.
[00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:18.161]  I want listeners and viewers to know we're going to have open phones throughout the next four hours that I'm hosting.
[00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:25.784]  We have a very special guest joining us, who was the creator of the Bioweapons Act that the U.S.
[00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:31.906]  got passed into world law by the U.N., and he's been a lawyer to major world leaders.
[00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:44.613]  He knows everybody at the highest levels of the World Health Organization and he says they know this is a bioweapon and are covering up what the Indian top technical scientific institute conclusively found.
[00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:50.534]  This virus is as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:52.255]  It's got the insertion points.
[00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:54.615]  It's got the markers.
[00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.496]  It's got the injection remnant points.
[00:05:58.236 --> 00:06:00.757]  That yeah folks, they've got needles so small
[00:06:01.817 --> 00:06:08.484]  They've got injection systems so small, they can inject in and gene edit into viruses now.
[00:06:09.965 --> 00:06:13.189]  Not just breed them and try to create them, they can actually edit them.
[00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:16.051]  But it leaves fingerprints.
[00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:20.096]  Plus it's from different virus families.
[00:06:20.316 --> 00:06:22.658]  It's ridiculous.
[00:06:23.703 --> 00:06:24.844]  How obvious this is.
[00:06:25.324 --> 00:06:31.367]  He's got major breaking news, enough for him to even take off teaching class today at the law school there in Chicago.
[00:06:31.827 --> 00:06:35.489]  He sent me a bunch of keynotes that I'm not going to get to until he joins us in the third hour.
[00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.311]  This is exclusive stuff from the professor.
[00:06:40.252 --> 00:06:41.253]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:06:41.293 --> 00:06:45.135]  And believe me, he's sticking his neck out there coming on this show with what he's about to break down.
[00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:47.376]  Now, let me say this.
[00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:49.097]  I've wargamed this a lot.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.558]  And we know that there is a major cover-up going on worldwide how bad coronavirus is.
[00:06:57.574 --> 00:07:02.558]  And we know that they're hiding the real numbers of infected and the real numbers of those that are very ill and those that have died.
[00:07:02.858 --> 00:07:10.465]  And now you see the exploding numbers on cruise ships and coming off airplanes and the exploding numbers in hospitals around the world.
[00:07:10.525 --> 00:07:14.168]  And they're trying to sweep the deaths under the rug to not create a major panic.
[00:07:14.688 --> 00:07:18.271]  But if health services get overwhelmed, they won't be able to hide it.
[00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:19.472]  They think that'll create a panic.
[00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:21.314]  China tried to hide it.
[00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:23.495]  China tried to cover it up.
[00:07:25.777 --> 00:07:26.418]  It didn't work.
[00:07:28.962 --> 00:07:32.783]  And so now they've lost confidence and their whole system is falling apart.
[00:07:33.383 --> 00:07:38.544]  They've got giant vehicles driving around spraying antiviral toxins into the air.
[00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:40.084]  It is a three-ring circus.
[00:07:40.884 --> 00:07:44.125]  Now, is this a cover for the fact that the Chinese economy was imploding?
[00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:46.005]  They lost their trade war with the U.S.
[00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:48.805]  They had major civil uprisings?
[00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:51.466]  Well, let's look at the different pieces.
[00:07:52.746 --> 00:07:57.147]  This coronavirus is conclusively from the SARS family.
[00:07:58.137 --> 00:08:01.480]  The Communist Chinese have been caught four times releasing it out of their labs.
[00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.222]  Doesn't sound like accidents to me.
[00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:07.266]  China has said their biggest problem is too big a population.
[00:08:08.747 --> 00:08:19.797]  It's estimated that 50 million girls and millions of boys as well, but mainly girls, were killed after they're born when families have them secretly at home in rural areas.
[00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.786]  I was going from memory, so I had them look up the number.
[00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:30.488]  Even from Wikipedia, it says 400 million births, mainly girls, since 1970, were terminated.
[00:08:32.008 --> 00:08:34.849]  Unknown tens of millions were killed as babies.
[00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:41.230]  So, you know, you hear these type of numbers from me, and people go, that's an exaggeration, Alex.
[00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.010]  They didn't kill 50 million girls.
[00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.770]  I'm sorry.
[00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.111]  The Chinese estimate 400 million.
[00:08:52.537 --> 00:08:56.521]  You hear stuff on this show and it sounds fake because it just, reality's too crazy.
[00:08:57.461 --> 00:09:13.676]  I gotta tell people, China has mobile execution vans in every city where they don't even give you a trial, they just drive you around in a van so there's no building, nobody hears your screams, nobody's lined up knowing where they're going, it looks like an ambulance, and then they drive up, butcher you on the tarmac, load the organs on, and fly it out.
[00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:19.561]  I learned about that from human rights activists 25 years ago, it broke in the news five years later.
[00:09:21.374 --> 00:09:22.515]  In fact, I forget his name.
[00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:27.038]  Who's that famous human rights activist that got China open to U.S.
[00:09:27.098 --> 00:09:27.619]  adoptions?
[00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:30.381]  He worked with the CIA and we've had him while he lives in Canada.
[00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:31.641]  He's really smart.
[00:09:32.702 --> 00:09:34.043]  I've been thinking, what is his name?
[00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:34.824]  And I can't remember it.
[00:09:34.864 --> 00:09:38.006]  Guys, get him back on immediately, with one he can remember who I'm talking about.
[00:09:38.546 --> 00:09:39.587]  Callers will call in and tell us.
[00:09:39.907 --> 00:09:45.592]  But there it is, China's high-tech death vans, where criminals are executed and their organs are sold back on the black market.
[00:09:47.748 --> 00:09:53.650]  We can talk about how bad is it going to get here, and I've got children, and I've got family, and I've lost family to respiratory illnesses.
[00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.450]  We all have, or at least most of us have.
[00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.730]  You're lucky if you haven't.
[00:09:57.131 --> 00:09:57.651]  You're blessed.
[00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.731]  We can talk about how bad is it.
[00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:02.932]  But to understand that, that's Stephen Mosier.
[00:10:02.952 --> 00:10:03.812]  Let's get him on immediately.
[00:10:03.832 --> 00:10:06.113]  There you go.
[00:10:06.413 --> 00:10:07.033]  Stephen Mosier.
[00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:11.855]  China pushes, it's Dr. Stephen Mosier, pushes race-based narcissistic nationalism.
[00:10:12.135 --> 00:10:12.675]  Absolutely.
[00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:13.455]  Please print that for me.
[00:10:16.204 --> 00:10:18.766]  If you're tuning in and saying, what's Jones doing right now?
[00:10:19.266 --> 00:10:20.987]  He's saying interesting things, but he's all over the map.
[00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:23.648]  I am brainstorming right now on air.
[00:10:29.412 --> 00:10:34.174]  Because what happens is I get set, and I have my line of thought, and then it's my fault.
[00:10:34.214 --> 00:10:35.075]  I get easily distracted.
[00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.416]  It happened at the very start of the show.
[00:10:37.476 --> 00:10:38.597]  And then I've got to reset.
[00:10:39.297 --> 00:10:41.859]  So let me just do that as best I can here right now.
[00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:55.407]  We can talk all day about how bad's it gonna be, what are they covering up, why the giant response, but the media's saying it's no big deal at the same time, why the unified global response, which you've never seen before, at least I haven't.
[00:10:57.388 --> 00:10:58.989]  Correct me if I'm wrong with a case example.
[00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:06.532]  But to understand that, and what's gonna happen, you need to know the origin, and you need to know what's behind it.
[00:11:07.373 --> 00:11:09.714]  And then when you know that, it gets even more frightening.
[00:11:10.973 --> 00:11:13.515]  And so we're going to be walking through it all today.
[00:11:13.975 --> 00:11:14.736]  I can tell you that.
[00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:16.857]  But it's serious.
[00:11:17.698 --> 00:11:19.539]  And they're covering up what's really going on.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:31.508]  And it's just incredible to me that it's so obviously a bioweapon and that it's so obviously race-specific on record for Chinese men.
[00:11:31.528 --> 00:11:33.430]  I mean, it's so specific.
[00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.892]  The Chinese genome is so close.
[00:11:36.772 --> 00:11:39.895]  Only other group maybe as closely related for a large population as Koreans.
[00:11:40.876 --> 00:11:44.459]  And so they're just tailor-made for a race-specific bioweapon.
[00:11:44.659 --> 00:11:50.885]  Because you don't want to use one, a race-specific bioweapon that, say, kills a mongrel, which we think of as a bad term.
[00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:53.748]  It's a good term, you know, for genetically being able to fend off against things.
[00:11:54.008 --> 00:11:57.030]  Everybody knows that pure breeds get diseases easier.
[00:11:58.372 --> 00:12:00.193]  And so look at British royalty and people.
[00:12:00.213 --> 00:12:01.014]  They're very sickly.
[00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:01.995]  They're very mentally ill.
[00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:03.536]  I'm not knocking Chinese folks.
[00:12:03.716 --> 00:12:05.077]  They're real smart and got some great attributes.
[00:12:05.097 --> 00:12:07.299]  But on average, there's problems with being inbred.
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.382]  And just as a genome, the Chinese are very similar.
[00:12:10.822 --> 00:12:16.507]  So they're perfect to hit with a bioweapon because you can kill them off and not hurt your own people.
[00:12:17.908 --> 00:12:18.949]  They're asking for it.
[00:12:20.503 --> 00:12:24.406]  The average white person is actually made up of a whole bunch of different diverse groups.
[00:12:24.746 --> 00:12:26.648]  Very hard to kill white people with bioweapons.
[00:12:26.848 --> 00:12:29.250]  Because whites wouldn't think of themselves as mongrels.
[00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.431]  We're like the ultimate mongrel.
[00:12:30.811 --> 00:12:33.613]  In fact, the English language is the ultimate mongrel language.
[00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:34.654]  Just everything about it is.
[00:12:35.014 --> 00:12:37.176]  And the thing about a mongrel is it just takes everything over.
[00:12:37.436 --> 00:12:39.337]  It'll take a piece of that, it'll take a piece of this, it'll whatever.
[00:12:39.878 --> 00:12:40.658]  But I'm digressing.
[00:12:41.239 --> 00:12:45.322]  This is perfectly made for Chinese and it doesn't just do that.
[00:12:45.662 --> 00:12:48.204]  If you were morally going to hit a group that was attacking you,
[00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.633]  You would only hit them with something that goes after military-age men.
[00:12:52.653 --> 00:12:54.074]  And that's what they're admitting.
[00:12:54.134 --> 00:12:55.696]  It's young men.
[00:12:57.637 --> 00:12:59.259]  Predominantly, this is wiping out.
[00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:01.761]  So specifically targeted.
[00:13:02.202 --> 00:13:03.963]  So specifically made.
[00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:07.431]  Now, do you think that just fell out of the sky?
[00:13:08.212 --> 00:13:12.495]  No, and the scientists look at it, the Indian top scientists, everybody else is looking at it and saying the same thing.
[00:13:12.795 --> 00:13:14.136]  They just get their funding pulled if they say it.
[00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:15.257]  That's why the U.S.
[00:13:15.297 --> 00:13:21.102]  and China and others who have the genome, the RNA sequence of the virus, will not send it out.
[00:13:21.122 --> 00:13:25.165]  People are like, why won't you send it out so we can identify it?
[00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:27.567]  Because when you get it, you go, my God!
[00:13:29.611 --> 00:13:30.812]  An oak tree's organic.
[00:13:30.872 --> 00:13:32.353]  A 57 Chevy's man-made.
[00:13:32.873 --> 00:13:34.114]  This is a 57 Chevy.
[00:13:34.554 --> 00:13:35.435]  It's made.
[00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:40.938]  Now the big question is, did the United States launch this against China as a reaction in the war?
[00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.300]  Because China's been secretly attacking us and pulling a bunch of stuff?
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.881]  Or was it something else?
[00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:47.342]  I think I have the answer.
[00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:50.944]  On the other side, InfoWars.com.
[00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.485]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:13:52.805 --> 00:13:55.847]  But all the experts I've talked to know this is a man-made bioweapon.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:09.031]  This bio-attack is race-specific, targeting specifically Chinese military age males.
[00:14:10.092 --> 00:14:14.096]  And that almost all the people infected and almost all of those dying are males.
[00:14:16.878 --> 00:14:18.059]  That's hidden in the literature.
[00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:19.962]  The medical reports.
[00:14:20.863 --> 00:14:29.486]  And then you get the scan by the major Indian scientific gene-splicing university, and it's conclusive!
[00:14:31.327 --> 00:14:43.471]  And now other groups have looked at it and said, yeah, it's even got the insertion gene that you see with RNA and gene editing where it was injected.
[00:14:44.912 --> 00:14:45.932]  And I'll use the analogy.
[00:14:47.551 --> 00:14:50.153]  It's like when you had breast implants, there's gonna be scars.
[00:14:53.354 --> 00:14:56.016]  There's signatures right there.
[00:14:56.956 --> 00:14:59.238]  And then it just gets more insane from that point.
[00:15:00.058 --> 00:15:02.760]  So, I'm not going to give the U.S.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:14.647]  government a pass and say for sure that somebody in the deep state on the American team isn't pissed at enough fentanyl being shipped in every couple months to kill the entire world population.
[00:15:15.353 --> 00:15:17.474]  You're like, that's what shipped into the U.S.?
[00:15:17.574 --> 00:15:17.814]  Yes.
[00:15:18.554 --> 00:15:19.754]  Enough to kill the whole world.
[00:15:20.514 --> 00:15:22.915]  That means a lot of it's not even getting delivered to the drug addicts.
[00:15:22.935 --> 00:15:29.317]  There's just so much of it that one shipment they caught coming in from Mexico would kill 10.6 billion people.
[00:15:29.577 --> 00:15:30.337]  That was our estimate.
[00:15:30.417 --> 00:15:33.678]  Other newspapers said 11 billion after we broke that.
[00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:39.660]  That was one shipment that would kill 11 billion people if they all took an overdose dose.
[00:15:41.192 --> 00:15:45.355]  That's why you see homeless everywhere laying out asleep during the day, asleep at night.
[00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:47.256]  They're not asleep, they're passed out on fentanyl.
[00:15:48.497 --> 00:15:52.959]  So is this how the United States says, we told you to stop that?
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.321]  Here, here's a race-specific weapon that kills military-age men.
[00:15:57.082 --> 00:16:02.085]  You wanna kill teenagers, boys, girls, white people, black people, Hispanics, Asians, old, young?
[00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:08.489]  We'll just hit you with a race-specific bioweapon.
[00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:10.150]  And I've told you, that's the wars of the future.
[00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.779]  I don't think Trump would do that.
[00:16:15.301 --> 00:16:18.004]  He'd hammer him economically, he'd try to overthrow the CHICOM government.
[00:16:19.426 --> 00:16:20.747]  I don't think Trump would do that.
[00:16:21.849 --> 00:16:25.132]  And Francis Boyle doesn't think that either.
[00:16:25.153 --> 00:16:27.195]  In fact, he thinks Trump's being played to a certain level.
[00:16:27.455 --> 00:16:28.577]  He's joining us in the third hour.
[00:16:28.657 --> 00:16:30.619]  Believe me, you don't want to miss this breaking information.
[00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:32.101]  It's so critical to everybody's future.
[00:16:33.806 --> 00:16:34.386]  No, it's different.
[00:16:35.307 --> 00:16:49.712]  If I hadn't been somewhat of a student of the Communist Chinese since I was three, four, five years old, my grandfather, my mom's dad was big into geopolitics and my dad was big into it, would sit there at the kitchen table when he'd visit Dallas or we'd visit Austin.
[00:16:50.373 --> 00:16:56.255]  We lived in Dallas, my mom's parents in Austin, and they'd just have five-hour discussions, you know, there with, he'd have
[00:16:57.685 --> 00:16:58.226]  Highlighter.
[00:16:58.386 --> 00:17:09.404]  My grandfather would talking about ICBMs and Merv technology and what how the traders were giving it the Russians and the Chai comms and you Burner Von Braun Blueprints and you know talking about all this crazy stuff
[00:17:11.058 --> 00:17:29.021]  Now the Chi-Coms will be the future enemy, but the corrupt, you know, planetarists or whatever my grandfather was calling them, wouldn't call them globalists, were allying with them and selling us out because it was part of the plan of Satan for the end of the world and all this stuff.
[00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:33.802]  I mean, you're four years old, you're like, you know, you're six years old, you're eight years old, you're listening to this stuff.
[00:17:34.442 --> 00:17:38.043]  And your mom's like, at least a little eccentric, but my dad didn't think he was eccentric.
[00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:38.943]  My dad was a smart guy.
[00:17:40.043 --> 00:17:42.285]  And then my mom's brother was an eccentric.
[00:17:42.326 --> 00:17:45.028]  He was involved in black ops all over the world and led a lot of stuff.
[00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:47.811]  And he believed that all this, you know, my list of my grandfather.
[00:17:48.672 --> 00:17:55.860]  And so I grew up hearing all this stuff and how I remember being like seven years old and they visited us on Christmas.
[00:17:57.338 --> 00:18:00.881]  And I remember my grandfather going, they want us to have a nuclear war.
[00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:07.586]  The Chinese dictator, whoever it was after Mao died, says he wants us to nuke them because they want to get rid of their population.
[00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:09.607]  They're the only group in the world that wants to get rid of them.
[00:18:09.847 --> 00:18:13.270]  That's why they fit into this world government scheme to reduce the population.
[00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:18.033]  And I'm telling you, they'll release a race-specific weapon and blame it on us.
[00:18:18.113 --> 00:18:19.154]  That's the plan!
[00:18:21.096 --> 00:18:23.718]  And I've told these stories before on air, years ago.
[00:18:24.494 --> 00:18:25.695]  You talk about a visionary, man.
[00:18:25.735 --> 00:18:27.396]  My mom's dad was smart.
[00:18:28.297 --> 00:18:29.438]  Way too smart for his time.
[00:18:30.479 --> 00:18:32.180]  And, I mean, bouncing off the wall smart.
[00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:35.403]  And eccentrics, the name of it.
[00:18:36.304 --> 00:18:44.811]  But you pull back from this, and you think about what's going on in China, they need an excuse to clamp down on their political enemies, a way to unify the population under control.
[00:18:46.665 --> 00:18:50.808]  A way to get the world to endorse their tyranny, something Trump's suddenly done that's wrong.
[00:18:52.229 --> 00:18:55.372]  You're like, oh, they would never kill millions of their own military-aged men.
[00:18:55.432 --> 00:18:56.452]  It's called a balance.
[00:18:57.793 --> 00:18:59.114]  That's what the Chai comms talk about.
[00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:00.735]  One-child policy.
[00:19:00.976 --> 00:19:02.036]  This is even from Wikipedia.
[00:19:02.357 --> 00:19:03.377]  I don't just believe Wikipedia.
[00:19:03.397 --> 00:19:04.738]  It links through to all the government sources.
[00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:13.525]  According to Chinese government, 400 million births have been prevented and tens of millions have been killed after they're born.
[00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:15.436]  Zoom in on that please.
[00:19:16.357 --> 00:19:19.358]  So, 400 million people, mainly girls.
[00:19:20.938 --> 00:19:22.699]  Maybe we can just put the article on screen for folks.
[00:19:22.719 --> 00:19:25.900]  Just type into Wikipedia, One Child Policy, we'll pull it up for folks.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.662]  But 400 million, right there.
[00:19:36.204 --> 00:19:36.684]  There it is.
[00:19:37.965 --> 00:19:41.146]  So if they'll kill 400 million people, mainly girls,
[00:19:42.287 --> 00:19:46.849]  Will they release a race-specific bioweapon only targeting military-age men?
[00:19:47.309 --> 00:19:58.915]  Yes, because they've done the demographics, and they've got an internal problem because there's hundreds of millions of more men than women, and they can't find women.
[00:20:00.556 --> 00:20:09.920]  So see, first they took the girls away from you, then they let you get up to 30 years old or whatever, let you extinguish some of your energy, and now they're just gonna kill you.
[00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:15.040]  The numbers all vary.
[00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:21.745]  But that's what's going on, and Xi Jinping is the culprit.
[00:20:22.205 --> 00:20:31.572]  Xi Jinping, if you were going to put your money on a bet, all the evidence points towards that, because they're the ones
[00:20:35.489 --> 00:20:39.110]  They're always talking about how they need to depopulate and why they joined the globalists.
[00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:41.491]  Now David Rockefeller said they're the model of the world.
[00:20:41.872 --> 00:20:46.333]  We want what China does to become the world model because they work with us and they understand.
[00:20:46.774 --> 00:20:47.554]  They're godless.
[00:20:48.294 --> 00:20:49.175]  The leadership is.
[00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:50.155]  They oppress their people.
[00:20:50.195 --> 00:20:51.035]  They kill Christians.
[00:20:51.055 --> 00:20:53.456]  They put Muslims in death camps who've done nothing.
[00:20:54.197 --> 00:20:57.538]  And they're just completely anti-God, out of control.
[00:20:59.056 --> 00:21:00.239]  I'll never forget that Christmas.
[00:21:01.081 --> 00:21:02.905]  I tear open the stuff and it's that globe.
[00:21:02.966 --> 00:21:04.449]  That globe's still somewhere around here.
[00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:06.795]  Torn up with holes punched in it and stuff.
[00:21:06.815 --> 00:21:07.617]  My friends will come over with
[00:21:08.846 --> 00:21:11.308]  My grandfather talking about the globe and showing me stuff on it.
[00:21:11.908 --> 00:21:21.534]  And it's that type of interest that they don't want the average person to have, so they just think Netflix is the world, or comic books are the world, or these comic book movies are the world, when it has nothing to do with the reality.
[00:21:22.074 --> 00:21:26.416]  And so, the evidence mounts, this is a race-specific bioweapon, well we know it's that.
[00:21:26.817 --> 00:21:34.962]  The evidence mounts that the shy comms launched this against themselves to save face about their economic collapse, their lost war with the US.
[00:21:35.922 --> 00:21:47.528]  And as a way to clamp down and control their population, and to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, while pushing out a weapon that still won't kill, you're five times more likely to get this if you're a Chinese man.
[00:21:48.353 --> 00:21:51.356]  And then it goes to Asians closely related to Chinese out.
[00:21:52.376 --> 00:21:57.901]  But, you know, if you are black or say northern European or whatever, you don't have much of a chance.
[00:21:58.342 --> 00:22:06.789]  Bad news is if you're Hispanic, you have some background tens of thousands of years ago in a Chinese bloodline that came across the Bering Strait, if you believe in that background.
[00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.431]  Well, things just got real.
[00:22:11.052 --> 00:22:13.374]  It's confirmed by
[00:22:14.534 --> 00:22:15.514]  Former top U.N.
[00:22:15.594 --> 00:22:17.035]  experts, former top U.S.
[00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:24.916]  experts, prestigious Indian universities, and so many others, that the coronavirus is a man-made bioweapon.
[00:22:25.896 --> 00:22:31.017]  And it's spreading like wildfire, and it's killing a lot of people, and the Chi-Coms tried to cover it up, and it failed.
[00:22:31.398 --> 00:22:35.198]  And the reports flooding out of China is piles of dead bodies.
[00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:40.479]  I mean, I've got the headlines right here.
[00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:41.920]  Cremation vans running 24-7.
[00:22:44.016 --> 00:22:49.460]  As China orders door-to-door mass roundups of infected citizens to be placed in quarantine camps.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.501]  That's close quotes.
[00:22:52.622 --> 00:22:53.903]  This is now being admitted.
[00:22:53.983 --> 00:22:55.324]  We're going to be going over all of that.
[00:22:56.625 --> 00:23:01.949]  China orders Wuhan to round up all suspected coronavirus patients in quarantine camps.
[00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:04.891]  Notice something here.
[00:23:05.972 --> 00:23:09.114]  This is Natural News and Infowars, February 6th.
[00:23:10.715 --> 00:23:12.076]  And the notice, it's Daily Mail.
[00:23:13.533 --> 00:23:16.835]  The 7th, and now AP as well today.
[00:23:18.295 --> 00:23:26.019]  Every article you see at naturalnews.com, they just deserve the credit, literally is confirmed within a day to seven days.
[00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:27.840]  Exactly as Mike says.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:35.403]  Because Mike's an engineer and his wife's from Taiwan, and he's got businesses over there, folks, and they're reading the real stuff over there.
[00:23:37.362 --> 00:23:39.903]  And so, again, we're not making any of this up.
[00:23:39.963 --> 00:23:40.903]  And I don't just go with Mike.
[00:23:41.243 --> 00:23:44.524]  I've got Francis Boyle and I've got countless others coming on.
[00:23:46.724 --> 00:23:48.985]  In fact, hell, here's some video of them loading more dead bodies.
[00:23:49.205 --> 00:23:53.446]  And notice in that one video, and there's, I've seen a dozen of these in the last day at least.
[00:23:55.106 --> 00:24:00.148]  There's a bunch of, looks like body bags already, there's some dead bodies already in there.
[00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:01.048]  Those bags look full.
[00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:03.860]  See, they're stepping over some of them to load more in.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.281]  So there's all these videos of vans.
[00:24:06.301 --> 00:24:08.542]  They're not picking one dead body up and taking it in.
[00:24:09.463 --> 00:24:14.986]  When the van doors open up, there's multiple body bags, at least, and then a dead body getting loaded in.
[00:24:15.266 --> 00:24:17.327]  They're going around picking up a lot of dead people.
[00:24:19.768 --> 00:24:22.129]  And these videos just pour in dozens a day.
[00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:28.453]  So just the human intelligence on the ground and the observational things that are going on is
[00:24:30.523 --> 00:24:32.704]  This is serious, but I'll tell you this again.
[00:24:32.724 --> 00:24:40.326]  Here's footage from last week with just, you know, piles of body bags in the vehicles and piles of dead bodies inside the hospital.
[00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:43.647]  And of course they arrested this citizen who did this.
[00:24:44.127 --> 00:24:54.210]  And this famous, he's famous because he was a Chinese doctor, who said a month ago, this is really dangerous, it's killing a lot of people, Li Wenling.
[00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.611]  They arrested him and then he died of the coronavirus.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.281]  After they released him.
[00:25:03.523 --> 00:25:04.304]  He was treating it!
[00:25:07.627 --> 00:25:11.171]  I mean, look, there's just, there's just trash bins everywhere.
[00:25:11.191 --> 00:25:12.413]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see this.
[00:25:12.713 --> 00:25:13.554]  Full of body bags.
[00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:24.376]  And these people go in the hospitals, the doctors are like, and who can blame them after like weeks of working to the death, like there's dead people everywhere, we've got a crisis, we need help.
[00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:26.316]  They're all pissed the government's been covering it up.
[00:25:26.757 --> 00:25:30.898]  So now their biggest problem is the doctors, the police, everybody are just getting pissed and saying, you know what?
[00:25:31.178 --> 00:25:32.538]  There's a huge cover up here.
[00:25:32.838 --> 00:25:33.439]  We need help.
[00:25:33.459 --> 00:25:34.379]  This is out of control.
[00:25:34.659 --> 00:25:37.560]  You can't lock down Wuhan and expect us to keep it contained.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.761]  You better get people in here now or this is going to blow sky high.
[00:25:41.738 --> 00:25:49.887]  And the CHICOMS just thought they could leave the emergency workers in place and have them work themselves to death, which they're doing, but now they're dying.
[00:25:51.128 --> 00:25:56.594]  And that's the thing about this stuff, ladies and gentlemen, is that it kills you really, really fast.
[00:25:56.634 --> 00:25:56.975]  And again,
[00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:18.159]  I can go over all the medical stuff and all the genetic history, I've got all the articles and documents and cross-references and the scans of it, and the P shuttle gene, in fact, print me all that again, but we know it's manufactured, we know it hits, five times more likely, Chinese genome of males.
[00:26:22.096 --> 00:26:23.458]  That looks like something the U.S.
[00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:24.018]  would launch.
[00:26:24.098 --> 00:26:30.245]  If you're going to be military and you're being hit with fentanyl and millions have died here and China won't stop it, well, you hit military-age men.
[00:26:31.627 --> 00:26:34.950]  And it messes up their economy, but we're not going to operate like that.
[00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:41.518]  Trump can't even make a phone call to the Ukraine saying, yeah, or get a phone call, great, fight corruption, which is U.S.
[00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:41.798]  law.
[00:26:41.998 --> 00:26:43.400]  If we give them money, they've got to agree to that.
[00:26:44.878 --> 00:26:49.501]  Trump is completely paralyzed other than promoting America and being able to get some good policies in.
[00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:50.842]  He can't do covert operations.
[00:26:51.082 --> 00:26:56.765]  And Trump would never sit there morally and do this, much less have them have that over his head.
[00:26:57.306 --> 00:26:57.786]  No way!
[00:26:59.107 --> 00:27:00.388]  Did some rogue agency do it?
[00:27:00.528 --> 00:27:01.228]  I don't believe so.
[00:27:01.488 --> 00:27:03.009]  Do we have stuff on the shelf like this?
[00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:04.470]  You better damn well believe it.
[00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.192]  That's why the Chi-Com stole it out of that Canadian lamp.
[00:27:09.838 --> 00:27:14.620]  Because the United States always does its dirtiest deeds in England and Canada to this plausible deniability.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:20.282]  Mine control operations were run out of the very same city that this coronavirus was weaponized in a few years ago.
[00:27:20.542 --> 00:27:22.303]  The Chi-Coms got caught stealing it.
[00:27:22.343 --> 00:27:23.283]  That's mainstream news.
[00:27:23.623 --> 00:27:24.263]  Even admits that.
[00:27:26.184 --> 00:27:38.449]  And so they're sitting on top of this, and I believe Xi Jinping, facing politically being overthrown because he's losing the political and economic war he's lost face, did this to crack down, have control, and shut down his political enemies.
[00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:53.010]  We'll walk through all the facets of it, the medical background, the peace shuttle gene, what the experts are saying, but we're going to take your calls throughout the next three and a half hours that we have left, or three hours and 21 minutes.
[00:27:55.370 --> 00:28:10.717]  A toll-free number to join us to give us your take on this specifically, and on Trump and his State of the Union and his speech yesterday, and where you see the Dems striking back next, and what you'd like to see the President do, and the Democrats trying to steal Iowa, and now saying the Russians did it, or 4chan did it with no evidence.
[00:28:10.737 --> 00:28:12.158]  I mean, you know, where's your homework?
[00:28:12.218 --> 00:28:13.238]  Oh, the Russians ate it.
[00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:14.519]  Just give me a break.
[00:28:15.538 --> 00:28:15.798]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:15.818 --> 00:28:16.098]  877-789-Alex.
[00:28:16.118 --> 00:28:16.419]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:16.719 --> 00:28:24.085]  And let's do first-time callers again.
[00:28:24.826 --> 00:28:26.307]  We took about 40 calls yesterday.
[00:28:26.327 --> 00:28:27.228]  We went to every call.
[00:28:27.588 --> 00:28:28.930]  It took the whole show, but we did it.
[00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.271]  I want to hear from you.
[00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:31.011]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:31.031 --> 00:28:31.732]  877-789-Alex.
[00:28:32.012 --> 00:28:36.776]  We're going to go to break.
[00:28:36.916 --> 00:28:41.540]  I'm going to tell you what I'm personally doing to fortify my immune system, and it's right here.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.621]  It's called Immune Gargle.
[00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:46.582]  15 parts per million silver, but it's not regular silver.
[00:28:47.463 --> 00:28:50.184]  They can make it a lot higher parts per million for the same price.
[00:28:50.544 --> 00:28:52.305]  This is what's judged the best and safest.
[00:28:52.805 --> 00:28:53.685]  It's immune gargle.
[00:28:53.965 --> 00:29:01.549]  This is what the Pentagon, as we showed you in the documents, had secretly found in their test, Texas A&M, that this is able to knock out the SARS family.
[00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:03.329]  I'm not even saying it's going to do that.
[00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.371]  I'm just saying it's nano silver, it's high quality, and it's ingestible.
[00:29:07.811 --> 00:29:10.072]  Not just eating gargle and spit it out, swallow some of it.
[00:29:10.432 --> 00:29:11.893]  It's what I do, and I love it.
[00:29:14.218 --> 00:29:14.758]  It's sold out.
[00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:16.279]  I told you yesterday it was going to sell out.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.881]  Before the show ended, it was sold out.
[00:29:19.281 --> 00:29:24.605]  The 16 ounces of highest end nano colloidal silver you're going to find anywhere, it's gone.
[00:29:24.845 --> 00:29:25.646]  Sold out as I told you.
[00:29:26.446 --> 00:29:32.530]  The one ounces are set to sell out at current sales rates by Sunday.
[00:29:33.311 --> 00:29:35.092]  I'm keeping them at the price they are.
[00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:36.073]  What is it?
[00:29:36.093 --> 00:29:36.333]  40% off.
[00:29:36.353 --> 00:29:38.154]  It's in a spray bottle.
[00:29:38.534 --> 00:29:38.995]  Take it with you.
[00:29:39.015 --> 00:29:40.355]  You can refill it with the other bottles.
[00:29:40.636 --> 00:29:41.416]  Spread it on your hands.
[00:29:41.476 --> 00:29:42.677]  There's a coating on the outside.
[00:29:42.997 --> 00:29:43.438]  In the mouth.
[00:29:43.518 --> 00:29:43.958]  It's perfect.
[00:29:45.572 --> 00:29:50.975]  What we do have, and I explained this yesterday, people three to one were buying the other bottles.
[00:29:51.035 --> 00:29:53.677]  Three ouncer, people weren't buying it.
[00:29:53.717 --> 00:29:55.118]  Well, suddenly everybody's buying it up.
[00:29:55.778 --> 00:29:56.679]  It's a really great deal.
[00:29:56.839 --> 00:29:58.060]  It's still discounted as well.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.022]  And I'm going to keep it at that discount price, at least until the weekend.
[00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:04.484]  And at current sales rates, it'll sell out by next week.
[00:30:05.064 --> 00:30:08.126]  A lot of people say, hey, if you have funding problems, just go ahead and jack the price up.
[00:30:08.286 --> 00:30:09.387]  I just can't do it.
[00:30:11.124 --> 00:30:13.746]  In fact, I love the crew, but they know the real finances.
[00:30:13.806 --> 00:30:14.306]  Tim Fregietta.
[00:30:14.326 --> 00:30:19.710]  As I caught him raising prices on the 16-ouncer, I said, I said I would do it.
[00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.751]  He said, listen, man, I know the bills around here.
[00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:23.892]  We need to finally make some money and operate.
[00:30:23.952 --> 00:30:25.253]  So you're begging for money on air.
[00:30:25.794 --> 00:30:26.334]  I said, okay, fine.
[00:30:26.354 --> 00:30:27.355]  He goes, plus it was already sold out.
[00:30:28.383 --> 00:30:30.465]  Tommy raised the price, it already sold out, so just don't even worry about it.
[00:30:30.485 --> 00:30:31.185]  And we looked at the numbers.
[00:30:31.726 --> 00:30:35.028]  But I told him, you're not raising the price on this until it sells out, the three-ouncer.
[00:30:35.649 --> 00:30:37.510]  That's just what I metaphysically want to do.
[00:30:37.951 --> 00:30:39.792]  I'm not going to raise prices during a crisis.
[00:30:40.453 --> 00:30:41.414]  Is this a silver bullet?
[00:30:41.474 --> 00:30:43.695]  Well, it is called nano-silver and the Pentagon loves it.
[00:30:43.956 --> 00:30:45.377]  There's a reason they call silver bullets silver bullets.
[00:30:45.537 --> 00:30:46.518]  They really care?
[00:30:46.598 --> 00:30:47.018]  Werewolves?
[00:30:47.358 --> 00:30:49.680]  The point is, everybody knew silver's good.
[00:30:50.421 --> 00:30:51.422]  Silver's good.
[00:30:51.482 --> 00:30:54.924]  You put coins on people's eyes when they die on the river, you know.
[00:30:56.025 --> 00:31:03.291]  Sticks for Choron or whatever, but the real reason is people knew that it was associated with wagon trains going west.
[00:31:03.711 --> 00:31:04.191]  It was hot.
[00:31:04.271 --> 00:31:05.272]  They didn't know how to keep milk.
[00:31:05.653 --> 00:31:08.415]  They'd throw silver dollars in the milk and it'd last two, three times longer.
[00:31:08.815 --> 00:31:13.839]  We know silver is antiviral, antimicrobial, and it's good for you in small dosages.
[00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:19.063]  Now, do you want to take the super silver wound gel that's super strong and the same patented stuff inside you?
[00:31:19.183 --> 00:31:20.524]  Not unless you want to die.
[00:31:20.604 --> 00:31:21.985]  No, it's topical and that's it.
[00:31:22.245 --> 00:31:24.046]  And it's the most powerful over-the-counter in the country.
[00:31:24.446 --> 00:31:26.487]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:26.847 --> 00:31:27.868]  Hardcore products.
[00:31:27.928 --> 00:31:30.989]  The best you're going to find, just like tomorrow's news today.
[00:31:31.429 --> 00:31:31.810]  Stay with us.
[00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:40.254]  So, Senator Cotton, over a week ago, said this is a bioweapon out of Wuhan.
[00:31:42.074 --> 00:31:47.277]  That's his opinion, but obviously he's been given a lot of intel that we don't have, but we have a lot of intel as well.
[00:31:48.667 --> 00:31:51.908]  And the question is not, is it man-made?
[00:31:52.409 --> 00:31:53.309]  It is man-made.
[00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:56.210]  The question isn't, is it race-specific?
[00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.071]  It is race-specific towards Chinese men.
[00:31:59.371 --> 00:32:04.433]  Five times more likely than anybody else to die from it if you're a Chinese young man.
[00:32:07.074 --> 00:32:09.375]  That's confirmed mainline science.
[00:32:09.475 --> 00:32:13.017]  Well, the question is, who launched the weapon then?
[00:32:14.017 --> 00:32:15.498]  Are you going to somebody's house or the police?
[00:32:16.806 --> 00:32:24.909]  You get a call that, you know, the lights have been off for three days at the neighbor's house, the door's open, the neighbor says it's suspicious, you go in there, somebody's dead on the floor, seven bullet holes in them.
[00:32:26.349 --> 00:32:28.250]  You go see, is the safe broken into?
[00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:29.350]  Did somebody take stuff?
[00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.390]  It's a robbery?
[00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.571]  Is it a crime of passion?
[00:32:31.611 --> 00:32:33.291]  Is it the ex-husband, the ex-wife?
[00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:34.452]  Is it a hitman?
[00:32:35.012 --> 00:32:37.192]  You know somebody shot them up.
[00:32:39.373 --> 00:32:41.634]  But see, the media doesn't want to have a discussion
[00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:55.431]  They just want to say, oh, it's a virus out of some exotic food market.
[00:32:56.511 --> 00:32:57.511]  Oh, it's bat soup.
[00:32:57.571 --> 00:32:58.431]  It's this lady's fault.
[00:32:58.471 --> 00:33:00.092]  That goes viral and it's fun.
[00:33:00.112 --> 00:33:00.752]  Ooh, gross.
[00:33:00.772 --> 00:33:01.492]  They're so dumb.
[00:33:03.752 --> 00:33:08.613]  Eating bats doesn't splice the HIV delivery system into a virus that isn't even the same family.
[00:33:11.274 --> 00:33:15.694]  It'd be like if I had a dolphin fin welded onto my back.
[00:33:15.934 --> 00:33:17.495]  You'd go, dude, you're not a dolphin.
[00:33:17.975 --> 00:33:19.075]  Like the South Park episode.
[00:33:21.203 --> 00:33:24.253]  When I could chop my wee-wee off, I wouldn't be a girl.
[00:33:26.472 --> 00:33:33.994]  And see, that's why there's this war on logic and what you can identify something, because they want people so brainwashed that anything can be anything in the future so they can release things.
[00:33:34.314 --> 00:33:37.715]  It doesn't matter what scientists say, just, oh no, it's all natural, don't worry about it.
[00:33:38.015 --> 00:33:40.096]  So no one gets the blame of where it came from.
[00:33:40.416 --> 00:33:42.677]  But this is, to me, I can't think about anything else.
[00:33:43.137 --> 00:33:53.840]  Trump's huge, the economy's huge, the globalist operations, what they're doing, how much trouble they're in, the Democrats trying to steal it from Bernie Sanders again is amazing, and trying to blame the Russians?
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.440]  And 4chan?
[00:33:55.941 --> 00:33:56.941]  We've got all those clips?
[00:33:56.981 --> 00:33:58.262]  I mean, that's entertaining as hell.
[00:34:03.284 --> 00:34:06.125]  It's still serious, but it's entertaining compared to deadly viruses.
[00:34:08.966 --> 00:34:13.668]  So the good news is, if you're not Chinese, you're not in as much trouble.
[00:34:13.728 --> 00:34:17.970]  Because the Chinese genome is so close that even other Asian groups aren't as badly affected.
[00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:20.011]  But I looked it up.
[00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:25.089]  Any other group, you don't have that big a problem.
[00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:26.090]  It still could kill you.
[00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:28.291]  Any pneumonia could do that.
[00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:29.912]  But this thing is mutating.
[00:34:29.952 --> 00:34:31.373]  Who the hell knows what else it's going to do?
[00:34:31.653 --> 00:34:33.014]  So it's serious for everybody.
[00:34:34.154 --> 00:34:37.837]  But I can't sit up here and just be like, everything's fine.
[00:34:38.717 --> 00:34:39.418]  Who knows?
[00:34:39.518 --> 00:34:40.638]  Maybe they're overreacting.
[00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:42.499]  But here's the big problem.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.403]  Why is Trump defending Xi Jinping and saying he's doing a great job and going along with the United Nations?
[00:34:51.121 --> 00:34:56.604]  When they're going, oh, Xi Jinping's doing a fabulous job checkpoint shooting women in the head.
[00:34:56.644 --> 00:34:58.025]  Let's roll that footage if we can.
[00:34:58.065 --> 00:34:59.486]  We can find it from a few days ago.
[00:34:59.506 --> 00:35:02.968]  A woman shot trying to get past checkpoint in Wuhan.
[00:35:02.988 --> 00:35:03.949]  They just shoot her right in the head.
[00:35:03.969 --> 00:35:11.153]  I mean, there's all this footage and the UN's like, oh, locking up whole apartment buildings, putting people in death camps.
[00:35:11.954 --> 00:35:13.334]  Oh, good job containing it.
[00:35:13.414 --> 00:35:18.918]  But then we finally say no more flights from China last week and the same UN officials
[00:35:23.576 --> 00:35:26.080]  Say that we're being xenophobic.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.423]  In fact, I covered this a few days ago.
[00:35:28.443 --> 00:35:30.406]  I actually had the articles quoting the same people.
[00:35:30.426 --> 00:35:32.049]  I should pull those articles again.
[00:35:34.454 --> 00:35:36.836]  Health Organization praises China's response, head of the U.N.
[00:35:36.876 --> 00:35:38.978]  praises it, and then pull up the articles, U.N.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.161]  condemns U.S.
[00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:43.463]  Trump calling for blocking flights.
[00:35:43.503 --> 00:35:53.673]  I want to show people, not just remind them, I want to show them the very same officials, like shoot people in the head, lock them up in their houses, death camps, cremation vans.
[00:35:55.589 --> 00:36:00.572]  But don't you stop a flight from China, you evil racist Americans, because that's the globalist narrative.
[00:36:00.893 --> 00:36:05.916]  And they think there's been a death of logic where everybody else can lock their border down, but we can't.
[00:36:06.156 --> 00:36:06.897]  What the hell?
[00:36:07.057 --> 00:36:12.000]  Because they can't join Trump in saying we deserve a border, and that's normal, like a front door on your house.
[00:36:16.964 --> 00:36:20.847]  If the coronavirus is no big deal, why is China engaged in draconian crackdown measures?
[00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:24.009]  Yeah, that's the answer.
[00:36:25.307 --> 00:36:27.970]  We know what's going on.
[00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:30.213]  We know what's happening.
[00:36:30.233 --> 00:36:32.275]  So I intend to take Victor's call from Europe.
[00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:32.856]  It says U.S.
[00:36:32.896 --> 00:36:33.977]  released bioweapon in China.
[00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:35.199]  You're welcome to your opinion.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:36.741]  Please convince me.
[00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:37.702]  I mean I think the U.S.
[00:36:37.802 --> 00:36:38.403]  is the second
[00:36:40.037 --> 00:36:40.418]  Suspect.
[00:36:40.818 --> 00:36:51.150]  If I had a suspect list, I'd say Xi Jinping to maintain control, to save face, and they know they've got tens of millions more men than they have women because they targeted little girls for their extermination in the womb and even after.
[00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:55.816]  And this is all part of a social engineering operation and China has the will to do it.
[00:36:56.196 --> 00:36:57.878]  China killed over 100 million other people before.
[00:36:59.174 --> 00:37:01.876]  And so I would look at Xi Jinping as the prime suspect.
[00:37:02.176 --> 00:37:03.817]  And then I would look at a rogue U.S.
[00:37:03.897 --> 00:37:08.800]  agency that's gotten too excited about what Trump's doing and wanted to really show China who the boss is.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.321]  We know this stuff's on the shelf.
[00:37:10.941 --> 00:37:11.582]  I would say the U.S.
[00:37:11.622 --> 00:37:12.442]  is the second suspect.
[00:37:12.822 --> 00:37:17.085]  But you have a third party that wants a geopolitical global collapse to bring down all nation-states.
[00:37:17.125 --> 00:37:18.105]  That could be in play.
[00:37:18.145 --> 00:37:21.828]  I mean, it's all up to your interpretation right now.
[00:37:21.868 --> 00:37:22.508]  We're not sure.
[00:37:22.788 --> 00:37:23.929]  We just know it's man-made.
[00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:25.350]  We know it's race-specific.
[00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:26.851]  We know it's as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:50.810]  And again, guys, bring me my whole giant two folders of coronavirus news, because I want to print all the P shuttle gene stuff, and the zero heads with the Indian University scan of the virus, and the university paper on that, all the stuff I had before I went on my aborted three, four-day vacation that was a working vacation.
[00:37:51.851 --> 00:37:57.134]  It didn't matter how beautiful the Caribbean was, and my wife and
[00:37:58.052 --> 00:37:59.554]  The youngest daughter out playing outside.
[00:37:59.594 --> 00:38:00.775]  I just, I was inside the whole time.
[00:38:00.795 --> 00:38:04.079]  My wife's like, you came here and you're working 14 hours a day.
[00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.361]  And I said, yeah, we're getting on an airplane.
[00:38:05.381 --> 00:38:05.781]  We're going back.
[00:38:05.801 --> 00:38:06.442]  She's like, I understand.
[00:38:08.324 --> 00:38:10.326]  But that's how serious all of this is.
[00:38:10.346 --> 00:38:14.031]  When this all got totally confirmed, I'm like, there's no way I'm sitting here.
[00:38:15.976 --> 00:38:18.038]  In the Caribbean while all of this is going on.
[00:38:18.138 --> 00:38:20.180]  So we will start the next hour.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.002]  I will go directly to your calls.
[00:38:22.763 --> 00:38:28.469]  And then we'll continue with your calls when Professor boils on and then right into the fourth hour as well.
[00:38:29.189 --> 00:38:31.392]  But that is all coming up here today.
[00:38:31.412 --> 00:38:33.073]  We're going to walk through every aspect of it.
[00:38:33.754 --> 00:38:34.595]  And I noticed that.
[00:38:36.198 --> 00:38:42.860]  I told callers, you can talk about Trump, you can talk about the economy, the globalists, you can talk about the open borders, you can talk about the attack on the second, whatever.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.861]  But I said, for coronavirus, that's what I want calls on.
[00:38:47.521 --> 00:39:00.444]  And I noticed that almost all the calls, in fact, every caller is about coronavirus because our listeners have got their ear to the ground.
[00:39:01.985 --> 00:39:02.465]  That's why
[00:39:04.284 --> 00:39:05.965]  They listen to this transmission.
[00:39:08.668 --> 00:39:11.050]  And everybody knows that this is the big enchilada.
[00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.951]  Whatever's behind it, it's synthetic.
[00:39:13.672 --> 00:39:15.213]  Whatever's behind it, it's man-made.
[00:39:15.233 --> 00:39:21.038]  Whatever's behind it, there's a larger plan here, and we better figure it out here together.
[00:39:21.939 --> 00:39:23.681]  Because this has globalists written all over it.
[00:39:23.701 --> 00:39:25.022]  Because when I say Xi Jinping,
[00:39:26.331 --> 00:39:39.599]  That is the globalist main strongman who told the Davos Forum three years ago he would defeat Trump with Juncker of the EU, and the UN wants our borders open and our flights open, but they don't want anybody else's.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:47.884]  And so, is this going to be the cover for some other virus they release against us?
[00:39:48.644 --> 00:39:51.025]  I don't know, but all my little spider senses
[00:39:52.045 --> 00:39:53.586]  Tell me this is the big enchilada.
[00:39:54.427 --> 00:39:55.467]  And by the way, we're going to break.
[00:39:55.487 --> 00:39:56.428]  We'll go back with your calls.
[00:39:56.508 --> 00:40:02.172]  But remember, the globalists are doing everything they can to shut down this broadcast.
[00:40:02.192 --> 00:40:07.135]  So when you word of mouth via email, text message, which are harder for them to censor, though they're starting there as well.
[00:40:07.155 --> 00:40:08.156]  Think about how evil that is.
[00:40:08.896 --> 00:40:15.461]  Or word of mouth, spread the word about InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com forward slash show, NewsWars.com forward slash show.
[00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:18.863]  Band-Op video and the live feeds there.
[00:40:19.864 --> 00:40:22.767]  That's how people find this info that are so desperate for it.
[00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.768]  So your word of mouth is key to winning the war.
[00:40:25.128 --> 00:40:26.850]  Please take action and separately.
[00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:31.994]  We know why institutional buyers and corporations starting three weeks ago are buying up all the food they can get.
[00:40:33.295 --> 00:40:35.937]  And that's because they know this is man-made.
[00:40:35.997 --> 00:40:37.118]  They know it's race-specific.
[00:40:37.479 --> 00:40:38.860]  They know this may mean war.
[00:40:41.742 --> 00:40:42.743]  Economic collapse.
[00:40:43.924 --> 00:40:44.404]  You name it.
[00:40:45.478 --> 00:40:47.761]  They know everybody's having respiratory issues.
[00:40:47.781 --> 00:40:48.682]  I've never seen so many.
[00:40:48.722 --> 00:40:52.846]  Hell, I told you I've been sick at almost three and a half, four, five years, whatever.
[00:40:52.866 --> 00:40:53.227]  I can't remember.
[00:40:53.247 --> 00:40:53.927]  It's over four years.
[00:40:54.969 --> 00:40:58.131]  And I got something respiratory a few days ago.
[00:40:58.171 --> 00:40:59.331]  I got a fever for a little while.
[00:40:59.811 --> 00:41:02.613]  So Owen was, you can't drag him away from work.
[00:41:02.633 --> 00:41:04.174]  And he's been super sick in bed.
[00:41:04.194 --> 00:41:05.714]  He finally was back up for five days.
[00:41:06.315 --> 00:41:08.376]  So everybody knows something big's going on.
[00:41:08.676 --> 00:41:13.198]  And that's why we have the highest quality storeable food shipped out as fast as they can package it.
[00:41:13.238 --> 00:41:13.958]  We have the food.
[00:41:14.018 --> 00:41:15.619]  It's just got to be packaged by our partner.
[00:41:16.299 --> 00:41:19.101]  And you get it shipped the fastest ordering at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:41:19.381 --> 00:41:21.382]  But instead of seven to 10 days now, it's 10 to 14.
[00:41:23.743 --> 00:41:31.066]  Now, their real average is about nine, but they're just getting nervous because the orders aren't going down.
[00:41:31.146 --> 00:41:32.166]  They're increasing.
[00:41:32.727 --> 00:41:33.987]  Major competitors sold out.
[00:41:34.047 --> 00:41:35.868]  We can still provide and fast.
[00:41:36.248 --> 00:41:37.708]  Guaranteed high-quality fresh food.
[00:41:37.728 --> 00:41:40.910]  Infowarstore.com and it funds the Infowar.
[00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.671]  A 360 win, unless you don't take action.
[00:41:43.691 --> 00:41:51.654]  I don't want to interrupt, then I'm leaving.
[00:41:52.972 --> 00:41:53.972]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[00:41:54.032 --> 00:41:56.233]  You're gonna finish up with these calls within Gregory's.
[00:41:56.613 --> 00:41:59.714]  And, of course, Harris and Smith are gonna take another hour of calls.
[00:41:59.754 --> 00:42:01.054]  The crew's volunteered to do it.
[00:42:01.315 --> 00:42:04.395]  So we're here, live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[00:42:04.756 --> 00:42:05.976]  So the live coverage continues.
[00:42:06.016 --> 00:42:07.076]  Everybody spread those links.
[00:42:07.356 --> 00:42:09.677]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[00:42:09.717 --> 00:42:10.297]  Don't let them win.
[00:42:10.457 --> 00:42:10.797]  No BS.
[00:42:10.817 --> 00:42:12.958]  Let me tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[00:42:13.178 --> 00:42:14.919]  See, I don't have some Machiavelli manipulative view.
[00:42:15.619 --> 00:42:17.820]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.000]  That's the real power!
[00:42:20.134 --> 00:42:22.377]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[00:42:23.238 --> 00:42:26.421]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:42:27.042 --> 00:42:30.406]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[00:42:30.987 --> 00:42:34.911]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.910]  They're demons.
[00:42:41.491 --> 00:42:43.633]  They're frickin' interdimensional invaders, okay?
[00:42:43.813 --> 00:42:48.937]  I'll just say it, make fun of me all you want on CNN or wherever, but everyone already innately knows this.
[00:42:49.177 --> 00:42:51.859]  These people are not frickin' humans, okay?
[00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:53.761]  You know what I want covered tomorrow night?
[00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:55.642]  I want this covered tomorrow night.
[00:42:56.023 --> 00:42:57.264]  I want GMOs covered.
[00:42:57.644 --> 00:42:59.245]  I want what's going on covered!
[00:42:59.586 --> 00:43:01.707]  I wanna fight these son of a bitches!
[00:43:01.727 --> 00:43:02.948]  I don't wanna have half measures!
[00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:05.671]  I don't wanna die and have them win!
[00:43:05.831 --> 00:43:06.972]  I'm sick of their crap!
[00:43:08.001 --> 00:43:12.744]  And I don't know how to totally ban them, but first, like Howard Beale says in Network, you've got to get mad.
[00:43:12.804 --> 00:43:19.448]  You've got to get angry, you've got to fight your humanity, and you've got to start kicking some New World Order ass in the InfoWars.
[00:43:31.084 --> 00:43:35.287]  In a matter of days, Dr. Li Wenliang went from treating patients to becoming one.
[00:43:35.808 --> 00:43:44.275]  The 34-year-old ophthalmologist diagnosed Saturday with the Wuhan coronavirus, dying less than a week later in the same hospital in which he worked.
[00:43:44.935 --> 00:43:52.201]  But if action had been taken when he and others started sounding alarms, the severity of the outbreak might have been understood sooner.
[00:43:53.394 --> 00:43:58.005]  Struggling to communicate, Lee spoke with CNN briefly by phone on January 31st.
[00:43:58.426 --> 00:44:01.333]  You could hear the hospital machines pulsing in the background.
[00:44:07.023 --> 00:44:12.527]  It was back in late December when Lee first warned friends on WeChat about a SARS-like disease going around.
[00:44:12.947 --> 00:44:20.372]  Lee sent a group message saying that a test result from a patient quarantined at the hospital where he worked showed a patient had a coronavirus.
[00:44:20.652 --> 00:44:26.796]  But hours after hitting send, Wuhan City health officials tracked Lee down, questioning where he got the information.
[00:44:27.336 --> 00:44:29.718]  Within days, they closed the suspected source.
[00:44:29.718 --> 00:44:30.079]  We're good to go.
[00:44:38.283 --> 00:44:43.226]  With Lee coughing too much and breathing too poorly to speak by phone, we asked Lee by text.
[00:44:43.727 --> 00:44:44.947]  How did you feel when this happened?
[00:44:45.448 --> 00:44:46.568]  I felt a little afraid.
[00:44:46.729 --> 00:44:47.869]  Afraid I would be detained.
[00:44:47.969 --> 00:44:50.091]  Afraid my family would worry, Lee responded.
[00:44:50.891 --> 00:44:57.455]  He agreed to sign this document, admitting to spreading rumors online and severely disrupting social order.
[00:44:57.856 --> 00:45:02.879]  It reads, we want you to cooperate with the police and listen to our reminder and stop the illegal act.
[00:45:03.139 --> 00:45:03.780]  Can you do that?
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.621]  Lee answered, yes I can.
[00:45:06.266 --> 00:45:18.930]  In the weeks that followed, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission maintained that there was no obvious evidence for human-to-human transmission, no infection of healthcare workers, and that the outbreak was, in their words, preventable and controllable.
[00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:22.671]  And with that, the people of Wuhan continued about their normal lives.
[00:45:23.795 --> 00:45:25.857]  Then came a sudden jump in infections.
[00:45:26.537 --> 00:45:31.761]  China's central government took over, scrambling to contain a spreading virus with a rising death toll.
[00:45:32.181 --> 00:45:37.045]  Chinese state media first reported that Li was one of several whistleblowers silenced by police.
[00:45:37.585 --> 00:45:40.727]  Calls for Li and the others to be vindicated grew online.
[00:45:41.127 --> 00:45:48.733]  China's Supreme Court even weighed in, adding, quote, it might have been a fortunate thing if the public had listened to this rumor at the time.
[00:45:49.338 --> 00:45:52.360]  But for many, including Lee and his parents, it was too late.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.501]  They all contracted the coronavirus.
[00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:56.802]  Lee's condition declined rapidly.
[00:45:57.203 --> 00:46:02.846]  But before his death Friday, he witnessed the support of thousands online who considered him a hero.
[00:46:03.542 --> 00:46:07.283]  Late Thursday night, Chinese state media first reported Li's death.
[00:46:07.683 --> 00:46:11.484]  The responses online reflected a profound grief and a deep anger.
[00:46:11.744 --> 00:46:20.346]  The two topics trended on Chinese social media were, Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology, and, we want freedom of speech.
[00:46:20.766 --> 00:46:24.667]  Both had tens of thousands of views before being censored.
[00:46:25.127 --> 00:46:27.348]  CNN works to murder speech in America.
[00:46:28.428 --> 00:46:30.268]  They work to prop communists shine up.
[00:46:30.308 --> 00:46:32.089]  Just remember who the real enemy is.
[00:46:33.547 --> 00:46:36.930]  Mark Zucker and the trash that thinks the American people are their slaves.
[00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:39.191]  Your calls are 60 seconds away.
[00:46:41.153 --> 00:46:42.374]  What we know is clear.
[00:46:44.055 --> 00:46:45.696]  This is not business as usual.
[00:46:45.716 --> 00:46:47.258]  This is a seismic event.
[00:46:48.018 --> 00:46:51.141]  And I told callers you can call in about a wide range of topics.
[00:46:51.981 --> 00:47:02.910]  Almost every caller, 20-something on the board, want to talk about the coronavirus and the admissions it's man-made and the attempts to suppress that.
[00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:05.752]  China tried to suppress what was going on.
[00:47:06.092 --> 00:47:07.672]  Tried to say it came out of some food market.
[00:47:08.312 --> 00:47:11.073]  Now major universities and others are saying it's manufactured.
[00:47:11.894 --> 00:47:13.634]  We've got a special guest who wrote the U.S.
[00:47:13.674 --> 00:47:15.855]  Biological Weapons Treaty joining us.
[00:47:15.975 --> 00:47:18.016]  His sources say it's totally manufactured.
[00:47:18.596 --> 00:47:20.456]  He's got exclusive breaking news next hour.
[00:47:20.757 --> 00:47:22.837]  I'll host the whole fourth hour too and take your calls.
[00:47:23.137 --> 00:47:24.978]  The war room's coming up after that with Owen Schroyer.
[00:47:25.318 --> 00:47:26.218]  Ban.video.
[00:47:26.318 --> 00:47:27.079]  Infowars.com.com.
[00:47:29.065 --> 00:47:33.147]  And those lovely AM, FM, radio and TV stations around your area.
[00:47:33.167 --> 00:47:39.230]  If you're listening or watching one of those, please spread the word because your word of mouth isn't paramount.
[00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:40.310]  It's the whole universe.
[00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.070]  It's everything.
[00:47:41.271 --> 00:47:43.612]  It's victory or defeat.
[00:47:43.852 --> 00:47:45.572]  You are the answer.
[00:47:45.853 --> 00:47:46.713]  Just understand that.
[00:47:47.513 --> 00:47:47.814]  Period.
[00:47:48.334 --> 00:47:48.634]  Okay.
[00:47:49.594 --> 00:47:50.795]  We got a load of phone lines here.
[00:47:52.073 --> 00:47:53.594]  I'm going to go to Victor in Europe first.
[00:47:53.654 --> 00:47:54.654]  He says the U.S.
[00:47:54.754 --> 00:47:56.295]  released a bioweapon on China.
[00:47:56.715 --> 00:47:57.515]  And let's be clear.
[00:47:57.635 --> 00:47:58.676]  This is a bioweapon.
[00:47:58.816 --> 00:47:59.436]  It is man-made.
[00:47:59.456 --> 00:48:00.076]  That's confirmed.
[00:48:00.757 --> 00:48:01.697]  It is race-specific.
[00:48:05.058 --> 00:48:06.559]  Why is there such a crazy response?
[00:48:06.719 --> 00:48:07.780]  Who would want this to happen?
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.580]  Who would be behind it?
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.360]  What do you think, Victor?
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:12.462]  All right.
[00:48:12.582 --> 00:48:20.685]  First of all, if you just look at it logically, it would be, why would the Chinese release a biowarfare weapon
[00:48:21.781 --> 00:48:23.762]  That would affect their own species.
[00:48:24.722 --> 00:48:25.422]  Doesn't make sense.
[00:48:25.502 --> 00:48:42.527]  But if you look at what's been going on in the world and how China's come up so dramatically, and they're the biggest competitor to the United States, and the only vulnerability, other than space weapons, would be to release biowarfare.
[00:48:43.748 --> 00:48:46.569]  So, but I want to go through a couple of things.
[00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:50.750]  One is, I've been sprayed externally and internally, and I can tell you
[00:48:51.755 --> 00:48:52.595]  Some of the effects.
[00:48:54.616 --> 00:49:10.582]  I had a farm in Virginia, and one day I'm driving up the driveway in my dump truck, and all of a sudden I see this white crop duster plane coming right at me, and then a bit of sudden bank to the left, and I was shocked.
[00:49:11.643 --> 00:49:13.123]  And I could see every little detail.
[00:49:13.563 --> 00:49:20.326]  The upper wing was slightly forward, the lower wing all white, black stripes on the wings going in the direction of the plane.
[00:49:20.996 --> 00:49:31.879]  Underneath it had this long gray tube, and then it went over my log cabin and sprayed this gray cloud over my log cabin, and then went back in the opposite direction.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.400]  And I was in complete shock.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.881]  And I called up the Sheriff's Department.
[00:49:36.921 --> 00:49:37.501]  They came out.
[00:49:37.561 --> 00:49:41.102]  They were, Deputy was interested in finding out what was going on.
[00:49:41.182 --> 00:49:44.823]  He went to the next county to see what might have happened.
[00:49:46.016 --> 00:50:00.038]  And then I called them back up later and they said, well, you know, then they started giving me a bunch of BS and they said, well, it must have been a plane from the forest fires in the Western part of Virginia, which was a hundred miles away.
[00:50:01.139 --> 00:50:04.319]  And that they decided to spray my home.
[00:50:04.499 --> 00:50:06.039]  And I'm like, why would they do that?
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:12.321]  And then, then the guy finally admitted to me, well, it's a problem for Northern Virginia, which to me meant CIA.
[00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:12.461]  And.
[00:50:15.189 --> 00:50:25.171]  When this plane sprayed my property, it made me realize why I had all this, all these scabs over my arms and, you know, when I would work on my beard.
[00:50:25.191 --> 00:50:27.032]  Let me just stop because you're not paranoid.
[00:50:27.652 --> 00:50:34.294]  I remember confirming with locals who even took photos, and this, we got to find it somewhere.
[00:50:34.314 --> 00:50:36.314]  So much stuff's happened here.
[00:50:36.354 --> 00:50:38.235]  This is like in 1997.
[00:50:39.075 --> 00:50:41.475]  People call me, I say, come to the radio office.
[00:50:41.876 --> 00:50:43.436]  They came and the woman had her
[00:50:44.873 --> 00:50:45.853]  I don't think so.
[00:51:05.538 --> 00:51:06.318]  They didn't get that part.
[00:51:06.338 --> 00:51:10.040]  They just got a photo of the helicopter, and that was being reported everywhere.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.800]  And you talked about it, you were a conspiracy theorist.
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:19.343]  But later, I got reached out to by the military, actually, saying, yeah, these are covert operations, we've been ordered to do it, but just know it's not the military, it's the Clintons.
[00:51:20.003 --> 00:51:21.584]  And then I learned, well, here's an example.
[00:51:21.604 --> 00:51:29.426]  Did you hear about all over the U.S., Colorado, Texas, New Jersey, drones in grids at night flying over houses?
[00:51:29.446 --> 00:51:30.767]  You heard about that the last few months, right?
[00:51:32.639 --> 00:51:33.161]  A little bit.
[00:51:33.442 --> 00:51:34.787]  Well now it's all coming together.
[00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:37.015]  I got a call from a trusted source, they said.
[00:51:38.001 --> 00:51:51.744]  They're testing airborne inoculations, so maybe Trump knows it's a bioweapon, and again, maybe he's being lied to about the origin, and they've got drones out spraying us with airborne inoculations so we don't get sick from it.
[00:51:51.784 --> 00:52:02.927]  That's how crazy this gets when they've got robot armies now, not just Amazon, preparing these giant hundred-story buildings that are going to have levels that just drones fly in and out of all day.
[00:52:03.227 --> 00:52:05.268]  It's taking humans out of the equation, folks.
[00:52:05.908 --> 00:52:09.791]  And these drones, you think, oh, they're delivering me food, I like them, pizza or medicine.
[00:52:10.172 --> 00:52:13.715]  But they get ordered, they get a little, you know, a handgun, they come kill you.
[00:52:14.195 --> 00:52:19.419]  You know, I mean, that's where this is going, is this is the robot takeover, doesn't look human-directed.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.703]  And the Chi-Coms, whatever they are, they're definitely dialed into the off-world stuff.
[00:52:23.723 --> 00:52:25.805]  And I just want to, I don't want to get weird here, folks.
[00:52:25.825 --> 00:52:30.048]  I'm just telling you what my gut level tells me is, this is something really weird going on.
[00:52:30.068 --> 00:52:32.550]  The globalists say they want a post-human world.
[00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.871]  So I believe you.
[00:52:35.638 --> 00:52:39.661]  So many declassified documents where it's never even the Pentagon.
[00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:40.521]  I'm not defending the Pentagon.
[00:52:40.561 --> 00:52:52.389]  It's always the Department of Energy or it's always some other subgroup sprays a town with some biological weapon and then they have doctors ready who are really military to test and see what happens.
[00:52:52.449 --> 00:52:57.772]  So you saying you got covertly sprayed, especially in Northern Virginia, my God, that's a huge testing ground.
[00:52:58.353 --> 00:53:00.154]  I am not denying that happened to you.
[00:53:01.054 --> 00:53:04.097]  And, you know, who the hell knows what they were doing or what they were up to.
[00:53:04.177 --> 00:53:08.240]  Human experimentation by the criminal group in bed in our government's massive.
[00:53:09.361 --> 00:53:13.004]  Their excuse is, well, how do we counter the Russians and the Chinese if we don't know?
[00:53:13.624 --> 00:53:15.566]  That's how they take that calculated loss.
[00:53:16.006 --> 00:53:19.109]  Like they convinced the Seventh-day Adventists, who are great people on average.
[00:53:19.169 --> 00:53:20.190]  I think they're great people.
[00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:28.076]  They convinced tens of thousands of Seventh-day Adventists, this is declassified, to be part of lethal experiments on themselves to be Christ-like.
[00:53:29.481 --> 00:53:47.637]  Okay, so so you know who knows what they're really up to who really but I can tell you then a lot of the seventh-day Adventists get told oh you're nonviolent you don't go to war so we just test biologicals on you for Jesus but some of those guys get convinced actually Jesus said by a sword you're not the seventh-day
[00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:49.660]  They say, Adventists, you're in the sword of the Lord now.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.902]  I'm not talking about a white supremacist group.
[00:53:51.222 --> 00:53:58.113]  They tell them you're in the sword of the Lord now, and this is the part when Christ pulls the sword, Christ says, dual action, and now you're going to be a killer.
[00:53:58.353 --> 00:54:01.458]  Well, somebody who's willing to die is certainly not afraid to kill.
[00:54:02.529 --> 00:54:30.300]  Okay, so you're in the really sophisticated stuff now, and I guess I can tell you, I'm not kidding, my family's not in the Seventh Day Adventist, but I can just say, in some of the groups, in some of the stuff they saw, they were hooked into the highest levels of it, and I mean, let's just say Richard Nixon was on the phone with them every day, so there's a lot of crazy stuff going on, and I'm just gonna leave it at that, but yeah, but I think to say that Trump would launch this, let me counter you with this, brother.
[00:54:31.872 --> 00:54:32.753]  One child policy.
[00:54:32.773 --> 00:54:37.418]  You say, why would China target its own genome or its own subspecies?
[00:54:38.059 --> 00:54:42.944]  Well, they said that they killed 400 million girls and tens of millions after they were born.
[00:54:43.005 --> 00:54:43.545]  Zoom in on that.
[00:54:44.206 --> 00:54:47.009]  And that's the Chinese government admitting all of that.
[00:54:49.153 --> 00:55:01.098]  You understand that they can inflict a wound on themselves to then get out of the fact they're losing the trade war and get out of the fact that Xi Jinping is so embarrassed and use that as a way to crack down as a police state measure.
[00:55:01.118 --> 00:55:01.878]  Does that make sense to you?
[00:55:03.416 --> 00:55:05.478]  It's not the most likely scenario.
[00:55:05.498 --> 00:55:18.189]  No, my hypothesis in Endgame, 13 years old, is that China and other globalists would launch bio-attacks on themselves as a way to set the precedent for political and social and medical crackdown.
[00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:19.950]  It's not like I'm just saying this today.
[00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:23.954]  Why are you saying it's the less possible scenario?
[00:55:24.034 --> 00:55:27.717]  Let me go on and tell you more about myself and what happened to me.
[00:55:28.317 --> 00:55:31.220]  And first off, and I'll go into how iodine
[00:55:31.929 --> 00:55:32.870]  Thank you!
[00:56:02.593 --> 00:56:07.996]  Stay there.
[00:56:08.397 --> 00:56:13.519]  Look, I want to have this debate, so I'm glad that Victor called in, but I've got to be in front of the other callers just to have him finish up.
[00:56:13.559 --> 00:56:20.864]  We'll never get to everybody, but he's saying that he thinks the United States or criminal elements of it launched this attack against Xi Jinping.
[00:56:21.932 --> 00:56:27.055]  Xi Jinping's on record sterilizing and murdering hundreds of millions of his own people.
[00:56:27.435 --> 00:56:29.256]  400 million, they say, mainly girls.
[00:56:29.997 --> 00:56:48.247]  So to say they're now going to hit males with a bioweapon that lets them take control, when they explain in their own one-child policy how they're doing it, that's a major piece of evidence that the Communist Central Committee, the Politburo in China, talks about their population being their main threat.
[00:56:49.431 --> 00:56:50.652]  I'm talking global policy.
[00:56:50.672 --> 00:56:52.672]  I'm not saying you didn't get sprayed.
[00:56:52.692 --> 00:56:59.215]  You know, I remember 15, 16 years ago, because I've been on coast-to-coast AM with George Norring, and it was 4am, and I went out in the backyard to smoke a cigar after I got off at 4am and drink a beer.
[00:57:19.824 --> 00:57:22.666]  Before I try to go to sleep for like two hours and go in and get ready to do my own show.
[00:57:23.246 --> 00:57:27.088]  And I'm drinking a beer at like 4 a.m., it's low clouds, and a Cessna flies over.
[00:57:27.388 --> 00:57:28.789]  I know a Cessna, my dad had one.
[00:57:29.289 --> 00:57:31.130]  And it's got spray tanks spraying stuff.
[00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:34.172]  And I watch this stuff and it smells like pesticide.
[00:57:35.273 --> 00:57:38.074]  And I go on air, I look online, can't find it, I bitch about it.
[00:57:38.494 --> 00:57:41.116]  And about a week later I get a call from the state of Texas.
[00:57:42.386 --> 00:57:44.208]  And they go, yeah, we heard about this.
[00:57:44.248 --> 00:57:45.149]  Here's a guy you can call.
[00:57:45.169 --> 00:57:45.849]  And he goes, yes, sir.
[00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:47.571]  And they sent me a press release.
[00:57:47.611 --> 00:57:48.452]  They emailed it to me.
[00:57:48.492 --> 00:57:49.272]  I covered it on air.
[00:57:49.793 --> 00:57:57.020]  They were spraying for some Chinese moth, same deal again, that burrows into trees and eats them.
[00:57:58.317 --> 00:58:01.219]  And now who knows if that was even what they were spraying for.
[00:58:01.259 --> 00:58:04.240]  But yes, there's a lot of spraying and a lot of weird.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:08.923]  And now, because later it came out, there was this giant statewide spraying for this.
[00:58:09.463 --> 00:58:16.067]  There was a beetle from like Indonesia and there was a moth and they were eating the trees and invasive.
[00:58:16.267 --> 00:58:17.507]  Everybody knows that goes on.
[00:58:17.607 --> 00:58:20.149]  So I'm not saying somebody didn't flowery and spray.
[00:58:21.667 --> 00:58:35.013]  I mean, hell, I remember the Sunshine Project 20 years ago got a Marine Corps document they accidentally declassified of the Marine Corps has drone helicopters ready around the country with opiate gases to knock out populations during civil unrest.
[00:58:35.513 --> 00:58:46.218]  But they find about a 9% death rate in simulations because people run cars, fires happen, you know, I mean, you fly over and spray people with super, basically, it was fentanyl.
[00:58:46.718 --> 00:58:47.839]  That's why MIT developed it.
[00:58:47.879 --> 00:58:50.120]  The Marine Corps has fentanyl-loaded helicopters
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:51.762]  That was just this document.
[00:58:51.782 --> 00:58:52.623]  I'm sure others have it.
[00:58:53.384 --> 00:58:56.128]  There's a spotted lanternfly alert.
[00:58:56.188 --> 00:58:56.969]  Yeah, I said a moth.
[00:58:56.989 --> 00:58:57.510]  That was it.
[00:58:58.071 --> 00:58:58.532]  That was it.
[00:58:58.572 --> 00:58:59.253]  Good job, Cronin.
[00:58:59.293 --> 00:58:59.733]  I found that.
[00:59:00.234 --> 00:59:01.256]  That's in another state, but...
[00:59:02.742 --> 00:59:03.982]  There's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:59:04.423 --> 00:59:07.664]  And most agencies are told, oh it's for this, but really it's for that.
[00:59:08.004 --> 00:59:09.484]  So I'm not disagreeing with you.
[00:59:10.025 --> 00:59:21.409]  All I'm saying is, the Chi-Coms are the only group that openly adopted the eugenics model, the Malthusian model, because they believe they have too many people, and that's what's holding them back from global domination.
[00:59:21.709 --> 00:59:24.730]  They don't just see humans as cheap, like surf lords do.
[00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:27.631]  They see them as garbage to be taken out and dumped.
[00:59:28.211 --> 00:59:29.372]  They see him as a minus.
[00:59:29.852 --> 00:59:32.614]  You're not just a zero, you're a minus to the CHICOMS.
[00:59:32.874 --> 00:59:35.455]  According to any communist system, you're a zero.
[00:59:35.735 --> 00:59:37.516]  But in the CHICOM world, you're a minus.
[00:59:37.837 --> 00:59:38.537]  Does that make sense?
[00:59:39.738 --> 00:59:40.578]  Can I make two points?
[00:59:41.719 --> 00:59:42.699]  You never respond to me.
[00:59:42.759 --> 00:59:48.443]  You never respond to, they say they want to reduce their population, and then you just go.
[00:59:48.463 --> 00:59:49.243]  You don't respond to that.
[00:59:50.604 --> 00:59:52.485]  Can I mention a few things to you?
[00:59:52.725 --> 00:59:53.045]  Sure.
[00:59:53.325 --> 00:59:55.727]  There's another possibility that it could be
[00:59:56.420 --> 01:00:08.042]  A lot of people talk about China versus the U.S., but there is, behind the scenes, an international group that goes cross borders that this could be part of.
[01:00:08.102 --> 01:00:12.423]  Now, and I'll make a point on your side, okay?
[01:00:13.144 --> 01:00:14.184]  Gulf War Syndrome.
[01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:21.865]  I have a friend who's a military contractor for CIA, and he told me, to my face, that it was in the vaccine.
[01:00:23.246 --> 01:00:24.806]  So ask yourself, why would
[01:00:25.342 --> 01:00:33.248]  The United States give its own troops this Gulf War syndrome, this weaponized mycoplasma.
[01:00:33.648 --> 01:00:37.171]  So, you know, this is arguing on your side, okay?
[01:00:38.352 --> 01:00:40.593]  And they eventually, they wanted to spread it worldwide.
[01:00:40.613 --> 01:00:43.355]  Now, I had... Well, that's right.
[01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:47.639]  You use your own... It was homosexual men in New York in 79 with HIV.
[01:00:47.659 --> 01:00:48.579]  That's declassified.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:49.320]  U.S.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.902]  military personnel are perfect to vector it worldwide as well.
[01:00:56.403 --> 01:01:06.157]  By the way, if you remember back in the 2009 avian flu, there was a woman in Ukraine who saw a plane spraying
[01:01:06.866 --> 01:01:07.566]  That area.
[01:01:08.107 --> 01:01:10.167]  And right afterwards, everybody got sick.
[01:01:10.407 --> 01:01:14.689]  Sir, there is no doubt there's corporate, private, and governmental testing.
[01:01:14.729 --> 01:01:15.410]  I appreciate your call.
[01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:18.351]  I love these calls, but it's so frustrating.
[01:01:18.371 --> 01:01:19.871]  I just spent a segment and a half with one guy.
[01:01:19.991 --> 01:01:20.572]  Great caller.
[01:01:20.812 --> 01:01:21.952]  We've got to take more calls.
[01:01:22.873 --> 01:01:29.615]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Maria in Washington State.
[01:01:29.675 --> 01:01:30.636]  Maria, thanks for calling.
[01:01:30.656 --> 01:01:30.976]  Go ahead.
[01:01:31.796 --> 01:01:32.396]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:32.557 --> 01:01:33.457]  I love you so much.
[01:01:33.737 --> 01:01:34.617]  I love Owen Schroeder.
[01:01:34.677 --> 01:01:35.658]  I love Will Johnson.
[01:01:36.576 --> 01:01:42.218]  I just wanted to ask you, have you ever heard, Alex, of a lie so big people believe it?
[01:01:42.598 --> 01:01:45.959]  When you have media, schools, magazines... Yeah, that's Joseph Goebbels.
[01:01:46.419 --> 01:01:50.441]  You're going to tell a lie, tell one so big that it's unbelievable that someone would tell someone that big.
[01:01:51.321 --> 01:01:53.402]  And we know about the fake news media events.
[01:01:53.482 --> 01:01:55.483]  We know about the fake vaccine agenda.
[01:01:55.923 --> 01:02:00.524]  We know about the fake hurricanes, the crisis factors, the mass hypnosis of people in 9-11, staged news.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.502]  And the coronavirus is like a common cold that they test you with an electronic device.
[01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:12.624]  And anybody, that's not scientific, anybody can have a fever for whatever reason.
[01:02:13.344 --> 01:02:21.228]  And Owen Troy was talking about how the, on Twitter, at the Wuhan Hospital, it has a hole in the ground by the doors.
[01:02:22.401 --> 01:02:24.802]  And, um, they could poison people with the medicine.
[01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:26.023]  They could blame it on Corona.
[01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.263]  They could put poison in the water.
[01:02:27.403 --> 01:02:27.943]  Oh, G.G.
[01:02:28.004 --> 01:02:29.424]  Pink could clearly use this.
[01:02:29.444 --> 01:02:30.385]  A lot of people are saying that.
[01:02:30.405 --> 01:02:32.706]  Because they're mainly going after Christians, it looks like.
[01:02:32.746 --> 01:02:33.346]  This is a cover.
[01:02:34.591 --> 01:02:38.192]  Yes, and all we see about the corrupt, we can't see it, it's just cartoons.
[01:02:38.772 --> 01:02:40.393]  And how can you believe anything they say?
[01:02:40.433 --> 01:02:42.193]  And what if they're just genociding the people?
[01:02:42.653 --> 01:02:44.514]  And a soft kill, this is how you would do it.
[01:02:44.554 --> 01:02:45.774]  You wouldn't come out and kill people.
[01:02:45.794 --> 01:02:49.455]  Well, I'm just saying, gut level, I don't think President Trump would do this morally.
[01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:54.356]  But B, he can't even call up and say, don't be corrupt under law to somebody.
[01:02:54.416 --> 01:02:56.777]  He's not launching bioweapon attacks.
[01:02:57.217 --> 01:03:00.798]  But the chi-coms have done this type of stuff with their people, that's all I'm saying.
[01:03:01.676 --> 01:03:17.689]  At the beginning you said this was as phony as a $3 bill, you called it ridiculous, and Drudge used the word virus hoax in a headline, and I'm thinking this is a cue for other countries to pick up this dark project, and it could be psychological.
[01:03:18.447 --> 01:03:20.549]  You know, when you've got everything bombarding you.
[01:03:20.769 --> 01:03:21.770]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:24.072]  When it's a real bio attack, they don't usually tell you.
[01:03:24.132 --> 01:03:27.535]  But almost everybody I know has had really bad respiratory problems.
[01:03:28.156 --> 01:03:32.119]  And then they can take other stuff that's going on and then make this the cover for it.
[01:03:32.179 --> 01:03:33.080]  You're certainly right.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:35.562]  A lot of times they'll say it's one thing, but it's really another.
[01:03:35.602 --> 01:03:38.264]  But I don't think they're faking the thousands of videos.
[01:03:39.005 --> 01:03:43.408]  ...of the body bags and the people being killed in the streets and people falling down and all this.
[01:03:43.448 --> 01:03:48.932]  This could be a Chinese Communist test for social control and they've got people out scripting it.
[01:03:48.952 --> 01:03:49.752]  You're absolutely right.
[01:03:50.113 --> 01:03:56.157]  We have seen the left hire AstroTurf, actual firms that are online that hire thousands for events like...
[01:03:57.014 --> 01:04:06.656]  Charlottesville, we pointed out and they sue us for saying it when they advertised and hired not people to get the woman killed, that part wasn't staged, but to have the clash.
[01:04:07.196 --> 01:04:10.377]  Most of the white supremacists were hired to play the part.
[01:04:11.057 --> 01:04:15.698]  And again, nothing against gay people, but you know, guys that are 35 never got an acting job.
[01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:19.119]  It was a bunch of little potbellied gay dudes in Nazi outfits.
[01:04:19.699 --> 01:04:21.080]  You know, out there for the cameras.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.902]  And you know, a few real Nazis showed up.
[01:04:22.982 --> 01:04:24.343]  And I hear what you're saying.
[01:04:24.383 --> 01:04:25.204]  God bless you, Maria.
[01:04:25.564 --> 01:04:28.486]  All right, when I come back, I'm taking five calls in the next segment!
[01:04:29.487 --> 01:04:31.109]  It's gonna happen!
[01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:35.312]  And then, Dr. Francis Boyle joins us in the third hour, fourth hour.
[01:04:35.332 --> 01:04:37.874]  I'll be here and take your calls continuing straight ahead.
[01:04:38.235 --> 01:04:40.136]  Infowars.com.
[01:04:40.517 --> 01:04:41.978]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:04:41.998 --> 01:04:45.241]  Well, I can tell you what's happening right now.
[01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:46.582]  We're taking phone calls.
[01:04:48.197 --> 01:04:48.877]  Unscreen.
[01:04:48.897 --> 01:04:51.438]  And by that we get what you're calling from and what you want to talk about.
[01:04:51.498 --> 01:04:54.779]  But we're not saying, oh, you say this, you say that, you're not on the air.
[01:04:54.819 --> 01:04:59.961]  We have a diverse group of people calling in and we're not censoring what you say on air.
[01:05:00.641 --> 01:05:01.522]  I may disagree with you.
[01:05:02.962 --> 01:05:04.503]  But we'll take a lot of calls this segment.
[01:05:05.643 --> 01:05:08.084]  But what we know is this coronavirus is man-made.
[01:05:08.164 --> 01:05:08.965]  How deadly is it?
[01:05:09.045 --> 01:05:12.046]  Well, that's up for grabs, but it looks a lot worse than what they've been saying.
[01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:16.989]  The response has been much bigger, and now we know cruise ships are shelling up, and people have already gotten in.
[01:05:17.009 --> 01:05:17.970]  There's no containing it.
[01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.912]  But it is race-specific, so that's just incredible.
[01:05:22.512 --> 01:05:25.373]  Then there's all this other amazing news at Infowars.com.
[01:05:25.934 --> 01:05:30.516]  DNC accused of sharing the wealth, redistributing Bernie votes to other candidates.
[01:05:31.096 --> 01:05:34.558]  Well, can Bernie Sanders even complain about that?
[01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:37.379]  It's fair to redistribute what other people have gained.
[01:05:38.199 --> 01:05:38.359]  Huh.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.060]  Shows how sick communism is.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.741]  And of course, what's next?
[01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:45.182]  Giving the Presidential Medal of Freedom to David Duke.
[01:05:46.883 --> 01:05:47.303]  That's right.
[01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:50.505]  Evil Rush Limbaugh, who's just a mainline conservative.
[01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:52.929]  He's a bad guy.
[01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:57.152]  But China that kills 400 million little girls, they're good guys.
[01:05:57.172 --> 01:05:59.914]  Because only white people can be bad.
[01:06:00.354 --> 01:06:05.518]  They're using our own Western openness against us, teaching us how we're bad, teaching us to hate ourselves.
[01:06:05.919 --> 01:06:13.925]  And it's saying once new people get here, they've got to be brainwashed by the globalists to hate America, or we're racist for not stopping them from destroying us.
[01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:17.788]  Unbelievable psychological warfare.
[01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:21.270]  Okay, so let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:06:22.128 --> 01:06:31.616]  We've got Bob, and Zeke, and Mark, and Jerry, and Karen, and Elliot, and Natalie, and Jesse, and DJ, and so many others who's been holding the longest.
[01:06:32.437 --> 01:06:37.021]  That'd be DJ in Georgia, again on the Wuhan Coronavirus in Hong Kong.
[01:06:37.582 --> 01:06:38.723]  Go ahead and give us your take.
[01:06:39.844 --> 01:06:41.585]  Hi Alex, it's such an honor to speak to you.
[01:06:41.785 --> 01:06:42.306]  Back at you.
[01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:45.249]  I participated in your Fulcon contest a long time ago.
[01:06:45.409 --> 01:06:46.750]  I did that Lego beatnik version.
[01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:47.871]  I don't know if you ever got to see it.
[01:06:48.451 --> 01:06:49.092]  I did, I loved it.
[01:06:50.043 --> 01:06:50.503]  Awesome, man.
[01:06:50.564 --> 01:06:52.145]  I was hoping you'd get a kick out of it.
[01:06:52.165 --> 01:07:02.473]  But I just wanted to say, this Wuhan coronavirus is starting to look like a possible cover-up to round up or just get rid of political dissidents who may have been sympathetic to, like, the Hong Kong protesters.
[01:07:03.674 --> 01:07:10.960]  I think it's a real thing, but, you know, engineered for that purpose so they can have a convenient opportunity to purge all dissidents right in front of the world.
[01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:14.062]  And have the world endorse it.
[01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:15.704]  Right.
[01:07:16.345 --> 01:07:22.808]  Yeah, I don't like Trump endorsing what Xi Jinping has done while the UN criticizes us for blocking flights.
[01:07:22.908 --> 01:07:29.311]  So, kill people, shoot them in the head if they try to leave quarantine in Wuhan, but they should be allowed to fly here from China.
[01:07:29.872 --> 01:07:30.112]  What?
[01:07:30.552 --> 01:07:31.833]  How does the UN get away with that?
[01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:34.594]  I know, man.
[01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:40.937]  There's so many conflicting stories, but, you know, China covering it up, but also enacting such draconian measures.
[01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:45.059]  I don't know, I'm getting that kind of vibe like it's a cover-up and an excuse to get
[01:07:45.797 --> 01:07:46.057]  I don't know.
[01:07:46.077 --> 01:07:56.904]  I think with the Hong Kong protesters, you see a possible uprising and a hunger for freedom that might have spread to China and they can clamp all that down with this coronavirus release.
[01:07:59.705 --> 01:08:01.827]  I think that's why Xi Jinping's behind it.
[01:08:02.067 --> 01:08:04.408]  Like, why would he release a race-specific bioweapon on himself?
[01:08:04.448 --> 01:08:07.130]  Well, they say their policy is to reduce their population.
[01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:08.991]  They already killed 400 million girls.
[01:08:09.031 --> 01:08:10.211]  Well, it's time for some boys to die.
[01:08:10.772 --> 01:08:12.353]  I kept asking the earlier caller that, like,
[01:08:13.291 --> 01:08:15.492]  Don't you understand they've stated why they do it.
[01:08:15.933 --> 01:08:18.194]  It changes the subject for them losing the trade war.
[01:08:18.614 --> 01:08:20.535]  It makes Xi Jinping and China the victim.
[01:08:20.935 --> 01:08:22.776]  That makes them heroes for controlling it.
[01:08:23.077 --> 01:08:26.178]  And the whole world jumps on and says you've done a great job.
[01:08:28.019 --> 01:08:28.520]  Exactly.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:35.424]  Look at this footage of people walking around with what looks like assault rifles going around and people up.
[01:08:35.464 --> 01:08:35.864]  Good Lord.
[01:08:35.904 --> 01:08:36.244]  Thank you.
[01:08:36.264 --> 01:08:37.185]  Great points, DJ.
[01:08:41.169 --> 01:08:42.891]  Let's go ahead and talk to Karen in California.
[01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:43.531]  Thanks for calling.
[01:08:43.871 --> 01:08:46.634]  She says China, genetic code, engineering, coronavirus.
[01:08:46.674 --> 01:08:47.755]  Give us your take, please, Karen.
[01:08:48.676 --> 01:08:48.956]  Hi.
[01:08:49.256 --> 01:08:51.058]  Have you heard of Hanlon's razor?
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:53.800]  Occam's razor?
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:01.267]  It says, never attribute to malice what can easily be attributed to stupidity.
[01:09:02.548 --> 01:09:07.633]  And my thing is, it may be genetically engineered,
[01:09:08.382 --> 01:09:09.703]  But maybe it was an accident.
[01:09:09.923 --> 01:09:24.812]  You remember about half a year ago, or about a year ago, there was a geneticist, a genetic engineer in China that was trying to genetically engineer children, babies, to be resistant to the HIV?
[01:09:25.232 --> 01:09:25.792]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:25.832 --> 01:09:28.994]  They weren't trying to, they were gene editing.
[01:09:30.395 --> 01:09:30.775]  Correct.
[01:09:31.335 --> 01:09:37.619]  So, what happens when a common coronavirus enters the bodies of these children?
[01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:39.059]  And mutate.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:43.922]  It's possible that this was simply an accident.
[01:09:45.002 --> 01:09:53.406]  It would be race-specific, it would explain the race-specific aspect, it would explain the HIV connection, and the Chinese ethnic connection.
[01:09:53.586 --> 01:09:56.247]  Yeah, I just don't think you have enough gene-edited CHICOMs.
[01:09:56.527 --> 01:09:59.849]  Maybe it's a few hundred maximum, not even that, to then...
[01:10:01.175 --> 01:10:12.959]  What I'm saying is that it may simply be an accident, a mutation, that because you said they did a genomic sequencing of this and that they discovered that there was a connection with AIDS.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.580]  That would explain it.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.500]  Oh, it could be mutating.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:22.203]  They could just be shedding it off of them because if you're going to make them immune to it and they've cut HIV into these kids, they're just off-gassing it.
[01:10:23.231 --> 01:10:26.433]  Yes, and we don't know what happens because we've never seen it before.
[01:10:26.453 --> 01:10:34.058]  Well, yeah, that's why you don't just randomly change a gene and then go, well, like they did this 50 years ago, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, it keeps happening.
[01:10:34.379 --> 01:10:40.083]  They'll change a potato or corn and it works in that first generation, but then it gets worse and worse.
[01:10:40.103 --> 01:10:42.264]  So Monsanto goes, well, we'll just not have it be able to replicate.
[01:10:42.544 --> 01:10:44.586]  You've got to buy it from us each time that way.
[01:10:45.406 --> 01:10:47.648]  Now they've killed the whole life process, but you get into the whole,
[01:10:48.795 --> 01:10:50.536]  Beyond Frankenstein situation.
[01:10:50.596 --> 01:10:51.096]  Great point.
[01:10:51.156 --> 01:10:52.457]  Who the hell knows exactly?
[01:10:52.917 --> 01:10:54.637]  China is doing so many experiments.
[01:10:54.677 --> 01:10:55.658]  Human animal clones.
[01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:58.999]  Cows that produce human milk 20 years ago that we know of.
[01:10:59.879 --> 01:11:00.700]  Spider goats.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.260]  Who the hell knows?
[01:11:04.901 --> 01:11:05.342]  Exactly.
[01:11:07.022 --> 01:11:09.023]  It's very scary, but it can happen.
[01:11:09.063 --> 01:11:11.284]  It can be an explanation for what's going on there.
[01:11:11.741 --> 01:11:16.143]  Yeah, China is a giant, mad scientist, globalist playground.
[01:11:16.223 --> 01:11:17.344]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:11:17.904 --> 01:11:18.705]  Amazing points.
[01:11:19.725 --> 01:11:20.766]  These are amazing points.
[01:11:21.586 --> 01:11:23.928]  Natalie in California, the coronavirus.
[01:11:24.348 --> 01:11:25.088]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:11:25.929 --> 01:11:28.190]  Hi Alex, it's exciting to talk to you.
[01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:37.215]  Yeah, so I live in South Orange County and about 20 minutes from one of the California patients that were tested positive for the coronavirus.
[01:11:38.172 --> 01:12:01.685]  And my son, who is 12, he was saying that he and other kids went to school with masks, so I feel like in the community there is a lot of fear, but there's nothing on the news with, for one, updates on the patient, and two, like, there's just nothing, there's no panic or stress, and from the footage that's coming from China, I feel like there should be more.
[01:12:01.705 --> 01:12:02.946]  I don't understand.
[01:12:05.626 --> 01:12:09.590]  Yeah, and you just see the footage of them dragging people out of their houses into quarantine.
[01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:15.214]  It's, it's, uh... I mean, what we're seeing is the image of a breakdown of society.
[01:12:15.274 --> 01:12:21.320]  So, I get Xi Jinping wanting to get control, but it just shows how they don't have control, because this stuff's coming out.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.161]  And this is killing the shycom century.
[01:12:23.522 --> 01:12:30.047]  This is killing globalism, which adds a thing of, okay, maybe it's the West's revenge, but maybe it's the incompetence of communism.
[01:12:30.067 --> 01:12:31.448]  I mean, look at Russia.
[01:12:32.109 --> 01:12:33.050]  I mean, Russians are smart.
[01:12:34.619 --> 01:12:43.708]  But once they were under communism, reactors blowing up, all sorts of anthrax being released, bioweapons constantly, and it was just because everybody's a yes man.
[01:12:44.128 --> 01:12:45.069]  Not that they're dumb.
[01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:48.212]  You put out negative information, you get in trouble.
[01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:50.735]  You report everything's fine, you get promoted.
[01:12:51.315 --> 01:12:53.037]  And it just creates a disaster.
[01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.039]  That's why authoritarianism doesn't work.
[01:12:55.339 --> 01:12:55.820]  The U.S.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.642]  has had its own problems, but it saw the British only
[01:12:59.603 --> 01:13:01.703]  Promoting people that were lords or royal.
[01:13:02.304 --> 01:13:02.684]  The U.S.
[01:13:02.704 --> 01:13:06.204]  was about, we'll kick your ass and promote people that actually have what it takes.
[01:13:06.644 --> 01:13:09.325]  And we did that, and we've been the dominant force.
[01:13:09.905 --> 01:13:12.865]  Now we're getting away from that, we're falling apart, but I think you've hit the nail on the head.
[01:13:15.146 --> 01:13:18.226]  Yeah, also, I wanted to plug some of your products.
[01:13:18.366 --> 01:13:21.547]  My son, he's seven, and he loves the Immune Gargle.
[01:13:21.607 --> 01:13:26.288]  We got the little spray bottle, and every morning he asks, he wants to spray it himself.
[01:13:26.348 --> 01:13:27.488]  It's his favorite product.
[01:13:28.384 --> 01:13:30.045]  I do the fish oils for the kids.
[01:13:30.125 --> 01:13:32.067]  The Lung Cleanse is one of my favorite.
[01:13:32.267 --> 01:13:33.968]  Iodine is amazing.
[01:13:34.468 --> 01:13:36.009]  So thank you so much for the products.
[01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:37.390]  Oh, and the Xanax.
[01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:41.852]  I used to take Xanax, and the Happys is the greatest replacement for that.
[01:13:41.933 --> 01:13:45.715]  I was in such a fog, and I don't have that with the Happys, so thank you.
[01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:48.417]  Well thank you and I appreciate your call.
[01:13:49.598 --> 01:14:02.806]  I haven't talked enough about Happys because it's just an herbal product with a bunch of known concentrated herbs that have been in all these studies and double-blind stuff proven to be way better than these hardcore drugs folks are taking and it's really a sleeper product.
[01:14:02.846 --> 01:14:05.168]  It barely even sells but we keep it on the shelves.
[01:14:05.528 --> 01:14:08.390]  People that do get it has a like a 99% review rate.
[01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:11.992]  I just haven't properly promoted the product but Happys is incredible.
[01:14:13.313 --> 01:14:15.935]  We are back live drug testing worldwide right now.
[01:14:20.242 --> 01:14:24.785]  And we're seeing global government exert its power over countering a virus.
[01:14:25.705 --> 01:14:28.787]  You look at the virus, it's race-specific to target Chinese.
[01:14:29.428 --> 01:14:30.788]  The media doesn't want that discussed.
[01:14:30.848 --> 01:14:32.950]  They don't deny it's true, they just don't want it discussed.
[01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:44.677]  And you see the world being taught how a police state works, with drones and robots managing people, a view of the future and what it'll be like under their technotronic control.
[01:14:45.257 --> 01:14:48.099]  Where, oh, the drones, they don't die from biological things.
[01:14:49.562 --> 01:14:54.205]  So they're going to deliver you your food and your water inside your little nest so you don't die.
[01:14:55.025 --> 01:14:56.486]  This is how humans are replaced.
[01:14:56.586 --> 01:14:57.947]  This is how the takeover happens.
[01:14:57.987 --> 01:14:59.447]  This is why they're breaking up the families.
[01:15:00.008 --> 01:15:01.769]  This is why they're domesticating everybody.
[01:15:01.789 --> 01:15:04.610]  Yeah, cue that up with audio.
[01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:12.795]  I want to show the drones shouting at happy Chinese farmers out in the middle of nowhere saying you need to be wearing a mask.
[01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.035]  Go ahead and roll that audio.
[01:15:14.055 --> 01:15:14.976]  As soon as you're ready, let me know.
[01:15:16.832 --> 01:15:17.593]  Don't look.
[01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:18.394]  This is our drone.
[01:15:18.414 --> 01:15:20.157]  If you don't wear a mask, don't go out.
[01:15:20.197 --> 01:15:20.918]  Don't run around.
[01:15:20.958 --> 01:15:21.659]  Remember to go home.
[01:15:21.699 --> 01:15:23.561]  Go home and wash your hands.
[01:15:23.582 --> 01:15:23.782]  Right?
[01:15:23.802 --> 01:15:25.344]  Pay attention to hygiene.
[01:15:25.364 --> 01:15:25.544]  Right?
[01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.427]  Our village is full of Chinese people.
[01:15:27.447 --> 01:15:28.989]  You can't say anything.
[01:15:29.009 --> 01:15:29.670]  You have to fly.
[01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:30.471]  Send a drone to fly you.
[01:15:34.685 --> 01:15:35.886]  This entire globalist force
[01:16:01.462 --> 01:16:03.123]  He wants us to not have children.
[01:16:03.164 --> 01:16:04.244]  There are no men and women.
[01:16:04.325 --> 01:16:05.205]  Don't have children.
[01:16:05.285 --> 01:16:06.206]  Don't go outside.
[01:16:06.286 --> 01:16:07.027]  Don't farm.
[01:16:07.467 --> 01:16:08.648]  Don't have human activity.
[01:16:10.290 --> 01:16:11.591]  All human activity is bad.
[01:16:11.691 --> 01:16:18.637]  And just drones are going to shout at you and tell you you're bad.
[01:16:19.778 --> 01:16:22.461]  So the Chinese police talk through the drones.
[01:16:23.769 --> 01:16:28.996]  That shout orders at you that things aren't completely empty as an exercise of getting people off the streets.
[01:16:29.016 --> 01:16:34.002]  Let's show some of the ghost town footage of how successful they've been.
[01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:39.689]  And by the way, that's not us playing bing bong bong bing bing bing to make fun of the Chinese.
[01:16:39.769 --> 01:16:42.092]  That's the music the government's playing in the background.
[01:16:45.056 --> 01:16:49.057]  That's the point we've reached here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:49.797 --> 01:16:51.517]  All right, who's been holding the longest here?
[01:16:52.258 --> 01:16:57.239]  We've got Elliot, and we've got Jerry, and we've got a lot of folks that have been holding a while.
[01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.019]  We've got Bob.
[01:16:59.099 --> 01:17:00.920]  We've got a lot of folks holding a long time.
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:08.022]  Let's go ahead and go to Bob in Kentucky, who's on another subject, impeachment, acquittal, Trump of the Dems.
[01:17:08.062 --> 01:17:09.122]  Thanks for calling here on the air.
[01:17:10.697 --> 01:17:11.457]  Howdy, Alex.
[01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:14.398]  I gotta say, I love the music you play on this show.
[01:17:14.818 --> 01:17:16.538]  Everyone's front, but whose song?
[01:17:16.558 --> 01:17:17.479]  That's my favorite, man.
[01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:18.359]  Thank you.
[01:17:19.899 --> 01:17:20.519]  I love you, buddy.
[01:17:20.539 --> 01:17:25.500]  Been listening for 11 years now, ever since I saw your old Bohemian Grove documentary.
[01:17:25.581 --> 01:17:28.021]  I just wanted to touch on the impeachment acquittal.
[01:17:29.301 --> 01:17:31.982]  Why are we focusing on the president?
[01:17:32.202 --> 01:17:40.224]  I mean, Joe Biden admitted publicly to doing the same exact thing that they're trying to say that Trump did.
[01:17:41.261 --> 01:17:48.563]  And we all know that really it's Congress and the deep state and the CIA that are really running the show.
[01:17:49.644 --> 01:17:50.984]  I say we impeach all of them.
[01:17:51.264 --> 01:17:52.765]  Just hit the reset button, you know?
[01:17:55.825 --> 01:17:56.926]  I totally agree with you.
[01:17:57.466 --> 01:18:01.627]  What do you think the Dems are going to pull next now that they've been routed again?
[01:18:04.188 --> 01:18:05.168]  You know, it's hard to say.
[01:18:05.208 --> 01:18:07.089]  I mean, everybody's rooting for
[01:18:07.782 --> 01:18:15.928]  Pelosi knows that she pulled her little petty stunt ripping up the State of the Union address and everybody's acting like, oh yeah, she's so anti-Trump.
[01:18:15.968 --> 01:18:20.972]  I mean, she just went along a couple weeks ago and signed off on his military spending bill.
[01:18:21.012 --> 01:18:22.513]  I'm telling you, it's all a show, man.
[01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:25.035]  I mean, they don't really care about any of this.
[01:18:25.455 --> 01:18:26.997]  They're all swamp beasts.
[01:18:27.897 --> 01:18:32.781]  We just need a giant bottle of, like, Drano or something to flush them all out.
[01:18:36.237 --> 01:18:37.459]  Well, I think that's where it's going, Bob.
[01:18:37.519 --> 01:18:38.400]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.304]  Moving the calls fast here now today.
[01:18:41.885 --> 01:18:43.687]  Jerry in Chicago, Illinois.
[01:18:43.767 --> 01:18:44.468]  Thanks for calling.
[01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:45.950]  Yes.
[01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:47.732]  I'll be quick.
[01:18:47.813 --> 01:18:49.895]  I know that you're busy.
[01:18:50.716 --> 01:18:53.961]  Right now, China is a disaster on many levels.
[01:18:54.965 --> 01:19:00.807]  One that people aren't talking about is you have a province of 54 million people under martial law.
[01:19:01.447 --> 01:19:03.208]  The rest of the country under pseudo martial law.
[01:19:03.848 --> 01:19:06.068]  Nobody, everybody in the country knows something's going on.
[01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:08.589]  Nobody's going out.
[01:19:09.349 --> 01:19:11.310]  Whole cities in China are just ghost towns.
[01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:14.651]  And that's affecting many sectors of their economy.
[01:19:15.151 --> 01:19:18.352]  They're backlogged on many orders that are just not being delivered.
[01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:21.373]  And you have the
[01:19:22.239 --> 01:19:28.422]  Chinese bank bailing out its own stock market for the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:19:29.062 --> 01:19:35.424]  You have Wall Street funneling clandestinely a trillion dollars of liquidity into the stock market.
[01:19:35.945 --> 01:19:41.147]  So you're looking at this being a huge powder keg in a sparse factory.
[01:19:41.167 --> 01:19:48.910]  The economy of China will affect the economy of every other country.
[01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:49.410]  So it's like a
[01:19:50.109 --> 01:19:51.209]  Kind of like a domino effect.
[01:19:51.689 --> 01:19:58.251]  So, you look at that situation and you think that this could be like a black swan on another level.
[01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:07.253]  An attempt to bring down the global economy because China has become to a great extent the engine of all consumerism?
[01:20:08.093 --> 01:20:08.293]  Yep.
[01:20:09.033 --> 01:20:09.793]  That's exactly right.
[01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:17.895]  And right now people need to understand that the same, you know, antics that are going on over there
[01:20:18.416 --> 01:20:21.738]  We'll be put in other parts of the world once things break down.
[01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:28.001]  And you know, it's really time for them to prepare, you know, and you have a lot of very good products.
[01:20:28.602 --> 01:20:30.403]  I've purchased many of them.
[01:20:30.843 --> 01:20:39.348]  I know that you have a 360 win mentality, which is, you know, something that I admire about you.
[01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:43.410]  You know, you give an honest price for an honest product.
[01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:52.125]  And the Chicoms give you a product, I'm not trying to be mean, but the joke is a Chinese toy breaks by the time it's out of the box.
[01:20:52.146 --> 01:20:54.007]  I mean, they never last more than a few hours.
[01:20:54.027 --> 01:21:00.412]  And then you buy some old American toy or old, even Japanese toy or old, like German toys or whatever, they just never break.
[01:21:00.792 --> 01:21:05.696]  You buy something from China, it's like, they know we're using them, they're using us.
[01:21:06.516 --> 01:21:08.318]  And it's like an iPhone, it's like $1,000 now.
[01:21:08.338 --> 01:21:09.338]  They said there's like $50 in it, maybe.
[01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:22.256]  And even Xi Jinping a few years ago told Tim Cook, hey, could you pay a little more so that our workers, you know, can have a house to live in?
[01:21:23.476 --> 01:21:26.358]  And Tim Cook just laughed at him and said, we're backing your party.
[01:21:26.438 --> 01:21:26.999]  He's on record.
[01:21:27.019 --> 01:21:29.921]  He said, I'll back any censorship or oppression you want.
[01:21:30.161 --> 01:21:31.182]  You just do what I say.
[01:21:31.902 --> 01:21:34.144]  I mean, Tim Cook is more evil than Xi Jinping.
[01:21:34.444 --> 01:21:36.625]  Xi Jinping tried to get money for Chinese.
[01:21:38.907 --> 01:21:40.528]  Again, it's okay because Tim Cook's gay, right?
[01:21:41.735 --> 01:21:58.431]  Well, you know, one thing I would like to say is, seeing as how you do have a lot of products to help on many different levels, it would be nice if you had a product that would help people stay solvent in case situations arise.
[01:21:59.192 --> 01:22:05.838]  And I actually think I have a product like that that you could use, and it's one of those 360 wins where
[01:22:06.556 --> 01:22:07.917]  You would help them and they would help you.
[01:22:08.117 --> 01:22:11.078]  Yeah, I never promote financial products just because none of them are perfect.
[01:22:11.138 --> 01:22:12.439]  It's not like an even exchange.
[01:22:12.499 --> 01:22:16.560]  I can't prove it'll be good down the road, but other than like gold or silver, that goes up and down.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.781]  I mean, what's the financial product?
[01:22:18.781 --> 01:22:20.802]  Well, that's what it is.
[01:22:21.122 --> 01:22:26.085]  It's precious metals, but in very, very small form.
[01:22:26.945 --> 01:22:31.327]  So we're talking about, you know, tiny little amounts so that people can get started.
[01:22:32.007 --> 01:22:32.848]  I think that's smart.
[01:22:33.028 --> 01:22:33.568]  So what is it?
[01:22:34.838 --> 01:22:39.822]  Uh, like, uh, it's in the gram form, right?
[01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:47.068]  So you're just buying a gram or two, up to the person how they want to purchase it, and this way they can get started on
[01:22:48.113 --> 01:22:48.954]  No, I agree.
[01:22:49.074 --> 01:22:55.799]  I think trading cards concerning metals and rare earth minerals would be a great way to get people understanding how it's the real currency of the planet.
[01:22:55.819 --> 01:22:56.960]  The globalists get it all.
[01:22:57.561 --> 01:22:58.381]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:22:58.401 --> 01:22:59.182]  Let me explain this.
[01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.725]  You hear about Jeff Bezos worth $150 billion.
[01:23:02.765 --> 01:23:04.126]  Folks, he's not worth that.
[01:23:04.206 --> 01:23:06.107]  That's all inflated, crazy stock.
[01:23:06.388 --> 01:23:09.190]  If you tried to spend it, his company would go down in one day.
[01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:12.272]  So people go, my God, 2% of all the money.
[01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:13.853]  It's all fiat now.
[01:23:14.654 --> 01:23:15.835]  It doesn't mean anything.
[01:23:15.855 --> 01:23:18.558]  If it's not an economy or people to spend it in, it's worthless.
[01:23:19.259 --> 01:23:26.247]  The globalists are trying to convince themselves robots will take over and they'll, because they got everything through fraud, the robots will keep control and I'll be left alone.
[01:23:26.727 --> 01:23:28.169]  Not gonna work that way!
[01:23:28.689 --> 01:23:30.291]  It's a human economy or it's nothing.
[01:23:30.792 --> 01:23:36.057]  And in your attempt to take us down and take control, you will do one thing and that's die.
[01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:39.312]  So, I'm trying to build a human economy.
[01:23:39.633 --> 01:23:40.754]  I've bet on it.
[01:23:41.335 --> 01:23:41.975]  I believe in it.
[01:23:42.075 --> 01:23:43.597]  And you see it beginning to succeed.
[01:23:44.198 --> 01:23:44.838]  Thank you so much.
[01:23:44.858 --> 01:23:45.639]  I appreciate your call.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:46.881]  More calls coming up.
[01:23:47.181 --> 01:23:55.850]  Dr. Francis Boyle with huge breaking intel that, believe me, nobody wants to miss on the real origins of this virus and where it's all going.
[01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:56.911]  Where are all my notes from him?
[01:23:57.952 --> 01:23:59.373]  I've got to get all those in place here.
[01:24:00.354 --> 01:24:02.196]  I may take a break and run a promo during this.
[01:24:02.216 --> 01:24:03.597]  I've just got so much going on here.
[01:24:03.617 --> 01:24:04.998]  I can't even keep track.
[01:24:05.018 --> 01:24:10.863]  Here's this note, it's right here.
[01:24:10.903 --> 01:24:14.966]  Dr. Francis Boyle, creator of Bioweapons Act, says coronavirus is a biological warfare program.
[01:24:15.446 --> 01:24:16.768]  By the way, I just know this.
[01:24:16.788 --> 01:24:23.033]  We're selling out of our immune gargle, but it's still the same price, and our storable food supplier is about to have to increase how long it takes to get it.
[01:24:24.864 --> 01:24:31.661]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seen tearing up her copy of President Trump's State of the Union address last night.
[01:24:33.150 --> 01:24:38.592]  Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripping up her copy of the President's State of the Union speech.
[01:24:38.692 --> 01:24:39.812]  Well, he will not be acquitted.
[01:24:39.932 --> 01:24:43.133]  The impeachment trial of President Donald John Trump is officially over.
[01:24:43.274 --> 01:24:47.935]  The Senate, as anticipated, did vote to acquit President Trump on both articles of impeachment against him.
[01:24:48.115 --> 01:24:49.976]  That's not how a democracy works.
[01:24:50.076 --> 01:24:51.376]  That's not how it works.
[01:24:51.836 --> 01:24:53.597]  That's not how any of this works.
[01:24:53.877 --> 01:24:54.137]  Bulls**t.
[01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:27.725]  Since that initial reporting, NBC News and other news organizations have tracked down messages like these from pro-Trump political message boards online, which show Trump supporters in real time on caucus night, not only posting and reposting the hotline number that precinct chairs were supposed to use to call in results to the Iowa Democratic Party, but explicitly encouraging one another to call and call and call again, specifically to clog up the lines, specifically to mess with the Democrats' ability to carry out the caucus.
[01:25:28.025 --> 01:25:29.046]  Quote, F them up!
[01:25:30.345 --> 01:25:31.626]  Keep clogging the lines.
[01:25:31.686 --> 01:25:32.707]  Keep clogging the lines.
[01:25:32.747 --> 01:25:35.289]  The results are not being reported because the lines are clogged.
[01:25:35.610 --> 01:25:36.911]  Keep clogging the lines.
[01:25:39.273 --> 01:25:43.877]  Now, it is clear that that is not the only thing that went wrong with the tabulation of the Iowa caucus results on Monday.
[01:25:43.957 --> 01:25:46.519]  But that, it turns out, is one of the things that went wrong.
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:49.902]  And it is the kind of thing we have seen before.
[01:25:52.219 --> 01:25:57.143]  The next Democratic nominating contest in 2020 is Tuesday in New Hampshire.
[01:25:57.524 --> 01:26:04.670]  New Hampshire state officials today held a press conference to assure everybody in the state and around the country that what happened in Iowa isn't going to happen there.
[01:26:05.290 --> 01:26:11.355]  That they have every confidence that absolutely nothing will go wrong with the primary in New Hampshire on Tuesday.
[01:26:12.196 --> 01:26:23.224]  One reporter asked explicitly whether the 2002 phone jamming scandal from New Hampshire might be a worrying past precedent for that state, given what just appears to have happened in Iowa.
[01:26:23.644 --> 01:26:31.790]  New Hampshire's Republican governor responded to that question by dismissing the matter entirely, saying that issue from nearly 20 years ago just doesn't apply today.
[01:26:32.671 --> 01:26:48.375]  It should be noted that the New Hampshire governor right now is a man named Chris Sununu, who is the younger brother of former Senator John Sununu, who is the guy who benefited from the illegal phone jamming scheme for which people went to prison in New Hampshire in that election 18 years ago.
[01:26:50.675 --> 01:26:58.997]  So I mean... Once again... By the way, InfoWars wrote a story about that.
[01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:05.052]  4chan is an anonymous bathroom wall that you can write things on.
[01:27:05.092 --> 01:27:07.653]  You can write truth, you can write lies, you can write nonsense.
[01:27:09.014 --> 01:27:15.897]  But that was written after the Democrats stole it from Bernie Sanders again, when he clearly won the majority, and they even admit that.
[01:27:17.418 --> 01:27:23.801]  So, she says it's 4chan, when 4chan wrote that after.
[01:27:25.046 --> 01:27:28.449]  People go, oh, don't criticize 4chan like we're mental patients.
[01:27:28.769 --> 01:27:32.933]  Don't criticize the walls of Rome, where anybody can write something.
[01:27:32.953 --> 01:27:33.594]  It's like Anonymous.
[01:27:33.714 --> 01:27:34.955]  Oh, it better not mess with Anonymous.
[01:27:35.235 --> 01:27:37.537]  Anonymous is anybody who wants to wear a Guy Fawkes mask.
[01:27:37.937 --> 01:27:43.262]  Do I have to bow down to it because it's Q the Anonymous or it's Guy Fawkes the Anonymous?
[01:27:44.543 --> 01:27:44.803]  No!
[01:27:45.764 --> 01:27:51.668]  You trust people that have been around a long time, that are there on record with integrity, trying to figure the truth out.
[01:27:51.728 --> 01:27:56.631]  It doesn't mean they're perfect, doesn't mean I'm right all the time, but we're right 97%, 98% of the time.
[01:27:56.991 --> 01:27:59.973]  Somebody else who's been right a lot is Dr. Francis Boyle, creator of the U.S.
[01:28:00.013 --> 01:28:00.673]  Bioweapons Act.
[01:28:00.993 --> 01:28:03.415]  He joins us coming up, and then we have the fourth hour.
[01:28:03.455 --> 01:28:04.475]  I'll continue with these calls.
[01:28:04.515 --> 01:28:05.096]  Everybody holding?
[01:28:05.436 --> 01:28:09.258]  Or we can call you back, or we can hang everybody up if you want to go, and we'll talk to you next hour.
[01:28:10.279 --> 01:28:12.560]  But for the next 55 minutes, we've got a break.
[01:28:12.741 --> 01:28:15.122]  Dr. Francis Bull's here, and he's done a lot of work.
[01:28:15.162 --> 01:28:16.563]  He sent us a lot of notes to go over.
[01:28:16.623 --> 01:28:19.965]  We've got literal scans of the virus for major universities.
[01:28:20.005 --> 01:28:20.845]  We've got everything.
[01:28:21.446 --> 01:28:30.071]  And this is one of the leading experts in the world, not just on the medical side, the genome, and then the RNA side, but also on the geopolitical and the UN sources.
[01:28:30.111 --> 01:28:33.633]  And he said, look, the UN knows this is a bioweapon.
[01:28:34.394 --> 01:28:37.876]  We know the whole coronavirus situation has had it written all over.
[01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:39.397]  So there's a lot to look at here.
[01:28:40.467 --> 01:28:41.928]  All I know is this is big.
[01:28:43.029 --> 01:28:43.890]  And I agree with him.
[01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:48.694]  He sent me some notes saying Trump is publicly congratulating Xi Jinping.
[01:28:50.155 --> 01:28:51.196]  That is not a good move.
[01:28:51.236 --> 01:28:51.416]  Yeah.
[01:28:52.677 --> 01:28:53.918]  Shooting people at checkpoints.
[01:28:55.079 --> 01:28:56.120]  Locking down whole cities.
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:59.102]  Trump does have an authoritarian stripe.
[01:29:00.303 --> 01:29:03.426]  And I like an American that takes the country back from globalists.
[01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:05.832]  But that's not authoritarian.
[01:29:05.912 --> 01:29:09.258]  I like a strong person in the Constitution, not a strong man.
[01:29:09.919 --> 01:29:18.074]  So we'll look at why Trump is praising Xi Jinping while Xi Jinping bitches to the UN that we don't allow flights from China.
[01:29:28.334 --> 01:29:39.761]  The best thing I can do is just let Professor Dr. Francis A. Boyle take over at least for the next two segments and host, because I know a lot, but enough to get in trouble, not enough to get us out of trouble.
[01:29:40.481 --> 01:29:43.363]  But he's a leading American expert in international law.
[01:29:44.482 --> 01:29:46.403]  He's represented world leaders at the Hague.
[01:29:46.563 --> 01:29:47.484]  I'm not going to go over it all.
[01:29:47.964 --> 01:29:52.626]  He's responsible for the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 89 that was adopted by the U.N.
[01:29:53.106 --> 01:29:56.468]  American Implementing Legislation in the 72 Biological Weapons Convention.
[01:29:56.848 --> 01:29:58.789]  He's served on the Board of Directors of Amnesty International.
[01:29:58.869 --> 01:30:01.011]  I'm just going to stop there because we don't have time to go over it all.
[01:30:01.871 --> 01:30:04.152]  He's a Bertrand Russell Peace Lecturer Professor.
[01:30:04.172 --> 01:30:09.055]  He went to the special PhD only one person gets a year at Harvard that Kissinger got.
[01:30:09.075 --> 01:30:11.116]  He was groomed for them, turned against them.
[01:30:11.676 --> 01:30:12.576]  And I'm just going to stop there.
[01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:17.618]  He holds the Doctor of Law Magna Cum Laude, a PhD in political science, both from Harvard University.
[01:30:18.238 --> 01:30:20.179]  And his latest book is Poems Against the Empire.
[01:30:20.759 --> 01:30:28.482]  And he joins us now for a truly real politic look, to use a Kissinger look, but just a human look at what's happening.
[01:30:28.982 --> 01:30:34.925]  And instead of me trying to ask my questions, I think it's undoubted, it's manufactured, it's been messed with.
[01:30:35.245 --> 01:30:36.125]  Who would launch it?
[01:30:36.285 --> 01:30:37.186]  What's going on?
[01:30:37.566 --> 01:30:39.006]  Why is Trump praising Xi?
[01:30:41.977 --> 01:30:44.038]  Xi is obviously using this as a major crackdown.
[01:30:44.478 --> 01:30:53.622]  So I respect your view so much, Dr. Boyle, that instead of me asking questions, just tell us what you really think's going on, and then just roll through what you know and what your sources are telling us.
[01:30:53.662 --> 01:30:56.243]  I've seen the first interview you gave a few days ago that went viral.
[01:30:56.703 --> 01:30:58.724]  We appreciate you joining Owen again, and now us here.
[01:30:58.784 --> 01:30:59.484]  Sorry I was out of town.
[01:30:59.524 --> 01:31:00.224]  I flew back early.
[01:31:00.244 --> 01:31:06.086]  About Trump's response, because I'm not just here to bash Trump, but it's true.
[01:31:06.587 --> 01:31:09.728]  Watching him sing Xi Jinping's praises
[01:31:11.138 --> 01:31:15.887]  While the UN praises Xi Jinping, but then says we're bad for blocking flights.
[01:31:15.967 --> 01:31:20.175]  That is truly oxymoronical and just insults logic.
[01:31:20.215 --> 01:31:23.000]  So what's first and foremost in your expert mind?
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:23.721]  And thanks for joining us.
[01:31:25.168 --> 01:31:27.749]  Well, Alex, thank you very much for having me on.
[01:31:27.809 --> 01:31:29.569]  My best to your viewing audience again.
[01:31:29.589 --> 01:31:36.451]  And of course, if you have questions, you can feel free to hop in because I know you have good sources of your own.
[01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:39.372]  I did want to correct the record.
[01:31:39.552 --> 01:31:42.873]  I never turned against the power elite.
[01:31:43.053 --> 01:31:46.353]  I was pretty much a mole for the peace movement there at Harvard.
[01:31:46.533 --> 01:31:46.994]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:31:47.014 --> 01:31:47.814]  I mean, you've been on many times.
[01:31:47.834 --> 01:31:48.154]  That's right.
[01:31:48.214 --> 01:31:48.774]  You were there.
[01:31:48.794 --> 01:31:50.034]  They thought you'd go with them.
[01:31:50.114 --> 01:31:51.935]  And then you never actually worked for them.
[01:31:51.955 --> 01:31:52.235]  You're right.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.500]  I never intended to.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.321]  I always intended to oppose the Globalonians.
[01:31:57.341 --> 01:32:04.143]  By the way, when I had the Kissinger Group try to hire me, the head of the Kissinger Group, in front of a crew member, say, you're just going to join us, this is dumb.
[01:32:04.163 --> 01:32:05.823]  I was never with them.
[01:32:05.883 --> 01:32:08.004]  They just thought I would immediately serve them.
[01:32:08.024 --> 01:32:08.804]  I think that's what you're saying.
[01:32:09.844 --> 01:32:10.384]  That's correct.
[01:32:10.904 --> 01:32:13.365]  But to get back to this
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:16.240]  We'll hand coronavirus.
[01:32:16.381 --> 01:32:17.581]  It's quite serious.
[01:32:18.181 --> 01:32:25.323]  As you know, because the work I did calling for and drafting the U.S.
[01:32:25.423 --> 01:32:40.727]  implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, which is known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, it was passed unanimously by both houses of the United States Congress
[01:32:41.682 --> 01:32:45.583]  And signed into law by President George H. Bush, Sr.
[01:32:45.783 --> 01:32:55.645]  I was even invited to the signing ceremony at the White House, but it was canceled because Gorbachev was coming to town.
[01:32:55.665 --> 01:33:00.767]  Of course, world peace was, I guess, more important than the signing ceremony.
[01:33:00.787 --> 01:33:06.108]  In any event, my legislation was specifically designed to deal with
[01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:16.187]  the abuse of DNA genetic engineering as to research, manufacture, and develop biological weapons.
[01:33:16.767 --> 01:33:33.197]  So, since that work, starting in the early 1980s, I have routinely watched the outbreaks of infectious diseases against animals and human beings around the world to see if there was a
[01:33:34.754 --> 01:33:42.679]  biological warfare agent at work, and so I did pay attention to what was going on there in Wuhan.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:59.510]  And based on all the sources I could find at that time and confirmed since then, this appears to be an extremely dangerous biological warfare agent.
[01:34:00.308 --> 01:34:09.822]  That leaked out of that Wuhan BSL-4 biosafety level 4 facility in Wuhan in South.
[01:34:10.343 --> 01:34:15.531]  The notion that this came from some fish market is a total canard.
[01:34:16.451 --> 01:34:22.233]  That was the leading BSL-4 facility in China.
[01:34:22.293 --> 01:34:31.277]  And I want to make it clear, Alex, I'm not here to bash China or the Chinese people or their communist government under international law.
[01:34:31.357 --> 01:34:33.478]  They can have whatever government they want over there.
[01:34:33.558 --> 01:34:37.059]  But this is a matter of world public health.
[01:34:37.874 --> 01:34:48.603]  And that BSL-4 facility, we have large numbers of BSL-4 facilities here in the United States, now in the Western developed capitalist world.
[01:34:49.103 --> 01:34:57.490]  These BSL-4 facilities have no legitimate scientific or medical purpose at all.
[01:34:57.930 --> 01:35:01.253]  They have one purpose, and that is to research, develop,
[01:35:01.833 --> 01:35:07.316]  Test, use, stockpile offensive biological weapons.
[01:35:07.416 --> 01:35:08.437]  Purely offensive.
[01:35:09.378 --> 01:35:16.362]  Purely offensive, although they try to justify it by saying, oh, we're developing vaccines.
[01:35:16.842 --> 01:35:29.049]  Well, that might be true, Alex, but the way this is done is they first DNA genetically engineered the offensive agent to kill people.
[01:35:29.847 --> 01:35:40.413]  And then they reverse engineer the technology to develop the vaccine because you do not have an effective biological weapon.
[01:35:40.613 --> 01:35:42.354]  You don't have a cure without the disease.
[01:35:43.334 --> 01:35:44.175]  That is correct.
[01:35:44.575 --> 01:35:52.159]  You can't use the offensive agent unless you can inoculate your own people with the vaccine.
[01:35:52.499 --> 01:35:56.661]  So that is what has been going on at that Wuhan BSL.
[01:35:56.741 --> 01:35:58.202]  And that's what my Pentagon sources told
[01:35:58.302 --> 01:35:58.542]  I don't know.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:21.841]  That's correct.
[01:36:21.921 --> 01:36:22.842]  They were doing both.
[01:36:22.942 --> 01:36:27.927]  And that's how all these hideous BSL-4 labs work here in the United States.
[01:36:28.307 --> 01:36:37.016]  And indeed, President Trump should shut down every BSL-4 facility here in the United States and BSL-3 before this happens to me.
[01:36:37.096 --> 01:36:43.282]  But my assessment, Alex, is that then whatever they were working on leaked out.
[01:36:44.809 --> 01:37:02.141]  And it probably, the first reported human case of this was December 1, so it seems to me it probably, there was an accident incident there maybe mid-November, and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering it up ever since.
[01:37:02.902 --> 01:37:15.634]  You saw the WHO director there, Tedros, over there meeting with President Xi, shaking his hand, smiling at the cameras, yucking it up, and saying what a great job he's doing.
[01:37:16.074 --> 01:37:17.816]  Well, you know, Tedros knows better.
[01:37:17.876 --> 01:37:25.864]  This is a WHO specially designated research lab to engage in the research development testing
[01:37:26.324 --> 01:37:27.184]  That's Greek for chimera.
[01:37:27.204 --> 01:37:28.325]  That means across species.
[01:37:54.844 --> 01:37:55.445]  That is correct.
[01:37:55.485 --> 01:38:03.139]  And by the way, this BSL-4 in Wuhan has leaked before, at least twice before it has leaked SARS.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:04.762]  And SARS...
[01:38:05.973 --> 01:38:16.021]  It is just a DNA genetically engineered biological warfare weapon starting with coronavirus and then making it lethal.
[01:38:16.341 --> 01:38:20.424]  And it's leaked twice before from this lab.
[01:38:20.684 --> 01:38:21.765]  All right, we're going to break.
[01:38:21.785 --> 01:38:23.066]  You're going to have the floor when we come back.
[01:38:23.146 --> 01:38:23.686]  Amazing.
[01:38:24.647 --> 01:38:29.190]  Biological weapons and a legal expert here, Dr. Francis Boyle, joins us right now.
[01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:34.995]  And just remember, Major Indian Lab comes out, says it's had the HIV delivery system welded onto it.
[01:38:35.515 --> 01:38:38.898]  They don't deny that, they just remove it under pressure, and now the U.S.
[01:38:38.938 --> 01:38:50.506]  government and others won't send out the RNA sequencing of this so people can tell how to test it, because when they get that, they look at it, and even low-level labs can go, oh my god, this is funny, it's a $3 bill.
[01:38:50.526 --> 01:38:54.889]  We'll get Dr. Boll's take on that, if that's accurate, that's what others are saying, straight ahead.
[01:38:54.969 --> 01:38:56.751]  Stay with us, please spread the live links.
[01:38:58.892 --> 01:39:03.516]  And if you get her name, well, you might not make it back.
[01:39:06.411 --> 01:39:12.116]  We don't know if looks can kill, but genetically engineered bioweapons can.
[01:39:13.237 --> 01:39:20.584]  And the hysteria we've seen by action, telling us to be calm in the general public, is the perfect storm telling me this is very serious.
[01:39:21.185 --> 01:39:24.128]  And over the years, when they say SARS is out of this or that, we have
[01:39:25.131 --> 01:39:29.655]  Dr. Francis Bolan, he says, well, it might be an engineering lab and here's the evidence of this, but it's not that big a deal.
[01:39:29.695 --> 01:39:31.416]  He's saying very serious.
[01:39:31.436 --> 01:39:33.558]  That's what my gut level tells me.
[01:39:33.598 --> 01:39:39.962]  And I've talked to a lot of other smart folks in special operations and also that are patriots of the CIA and they say,
[01:39:40.763 --> 01:39:53.311]  Just what he just said, but then we were afraid to even come on air and say all that because we don't want to speculate because these people were speculating that they think China was developing this for deployment against the United States and then it got out.
[01:39:53.752 --> 01:39:56.914]  And you ask the question, well, then why the hell would it be race specific?
[01:39:57.774 --> 01:40:00.256]  Why would it have to be so obvious it was race specific?
[01:40:00.296 --> 01:40:02.478]  And that's because it was for a vaccine.
[01:40:03.178 --> 01:40:06.480]  But again, you've got to make the weapon before you make the vaccine.
[01:40:07.121 --> 01:40:07.901]  I don't I agree with you.
[01:40:07.921 --> 01:40:10.243]  I don't think the Chai comms released this on purpose.
[01:40:11.423 --> 01:40:12.924]  You're the expert on bioweapons.
[01:40:13.485 --> 01:40:17.287]  How do you create a race-specific bioweapon but not have a signature of who did it?
[01:40:17.807 --> 01:40:20.829]  Or do you release it on your own people and know it's going to mutate a certain way?
[01:40:20.869 --> 01:40:23.571]  I mean, this does look like a train wreck.
[01:40:23.711 --> 01:40:25.973]  How would you release a race-specific bioweapon?
[01:40:26.013 --> 01:40:27.373]  We know Dick Cheney's obsessed with that.
[01:40:27.874 --> 01:40:28.694]  And cover it up.
[01:40:28.714 --> 01:40:31.036]  Because some are going to say, and I've raised that point, Dr. Boyle,
[01:40:31.736 --> 01:40:36.537]  That we've been in a fentanyl war with the chi-coms, a lot of big stuff going on.
[01:40:36.758 --> 01:40:37.718]  Is this a tit-for-tat?
[01:40:37.838 --> 01:40:43.219]  I just don't see Trump and others doing this, but maybe some third-party group to bring down the global economy?
[01:40:43.259 --> 01:40:48.661]  I mean, war-gaming this, why do you come to the conclusion it was a bio-weapon, a secret vaccine that leaks?
[01:40:49.061 --> 01:40:51.802]  Because that's what all the other smart people are telling me off-record.
[01:40:53.499 --> 01:40:58.083]  Well, let me continue with my analysis of this agent.
[01:40:58.203 --> 01:41:00.445]  It's been DNA genetically engineered.
[01:41:03.267 --> 01:41:09.553]  They took coronavirus and they weaponized it with SARS, which leaked out twice in a row.
[01:41:10.633 --> 01:41:23.440]  This time they turbo-charged the SARS they already had, which was a biological warfare agent, by mating it with the flu virus, which is one of the reasons why it's so infectious.
[01:41:24.241 --> 01:41:29.103]  That type of work has been done before up at the University of Wisconsin.
[01:41:29.143 --> 01:41:35.026]  This Dr. Mengele Karelka, he's done it.
[01:41:35.166 --> 01:41:37.768]  So it's out there in the literature how to do it.
[01:41:38.388 --> 01:41:45.711]  And then third, as you correctly pointed out, the third element is the genetic material for HIV.
[01:41:46.191 --> 01:41:48.352]  I read that study when it came out.
[01:41:48.853 --> 01:41:51.794]  It was convincing to me, including the pictures.
[01:41:52.354 --> 01:41:57.516]  Obviously, I believe the Chinese government put pressure on the Indian government to take it down.
[01:41:58.056 --> 01:41:59.317]  So it was taken down.
[01:42:00.049 --> 01:42:06.990]  And then, finally, it does have gain-of-function properties.
[01:42:07.050 --> 01:42:12.211]  There's been a lot of research going on on that development testing by U.S.
[01:42:12.271 --> 01:42:13.752]  biowarfare facilities.
[01:42:13.852 --> 01:42:17.572]  Indeed, the Obama administration put a pause on it.
[01:42:17.632 --> 01:42:18.592]  It was so dangerous.
[01:42:19.313 --> 01:42:21.653]  But then the pause was listed.
[01:42:22.513 --> 01:42:26.634]  And so, for example— What about the reports it was stolen out of a research lab in Canada by the CHOCOMS?
[01:42:28.328 --> 01:42:35.250]  Yes, well, let me finish then, and we'll get back to that point, but let me finish the point.
[01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:36.491]  So, gain of function.
[01:42:36.951 --> 01:42:40.552]  SARS has a radius for the droplets of 3 feet.
[01:42:41.113 --> 01:42:43.813]  This has a radius of at least 6 feet.
[01:42:44.334 --> 01:42:46.354]  So, it travels through the air.
[01:42:48.035 --> 01:42:53.557]  It has a lethality rate of about 15% and infectivity rate of about 83%.
[01:42:54.517 --> 01:42:56.438]  Those are figures from Lancet.
[01:42:57.468 --> 01:43:10.714]  It has an incubation period of at least 14 days, and it is asymptomatic, which means that people could be spreading the coronavirus and show no symptoms at all.
[01:43:11.174 --> 01:43:13.895]  So, yes, it is extremely dangerous.
[01:43:14.335 --> 01:43:17.157]  We're not exactly sure how dangerous it is.
[01:43:17.797 --> 01:43:22.379]  As to your point on ethnic-specific biological weapons,
[01:43:22.979 --> 01:43:23.239]  Yes.
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:30.145]  We've tried to develop them here in the United States under the influence of the neocons who believe in these things.
[01:43:30.625 --> 01:43:32.867]  That's in the PNAC report.
[01:43:33.347 --> 01:43:34.648]  They worked for Reagan.
[01:43:35.049 --> 01:43:38.652]  They then have worked again for Bush Jr.
[01:43:39.952 --> 01:43:48.256]  Regretfully, they seem to have come back into power under President Trump, but maybe he'll fire them like he did Bolton.
[01:43:48.756 --> 01:43:50.197]  We've discussed that before.
[01:43:50.997 --> 01:43:53.098]  The Israelis have worked on it.
[01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:54.919]  The South Africans?
[01:43:55.759 --> 01:43:57.520]  Under the apartheid regime.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:03.963]  However, today's New York Times just reported the first black African
[01:44:04.803 --> 01:44:06.063]  I think that is my conclusion, Alex.
[01:44:06.103 --> 01:44:06.644]  That's correct.
[01:44:06.664 --> 01:44:08.164]  So I don't think this is that.
[01:44:26.061 --> 01:44:52.707]  But it's clear this thing blew back on the Chinese, just as all these hideous biological warfare agents that we're working on our own BSL4 facilities... Like Lyme disease, we probably... that thing came from that New York offshore lab, the deer swam across Plum Island, and the Russians, the Kamchatka release of anthrax, remember that?
[01:44:53.806 --> 01:45:00.311]  Yes, the Lyme disease clearly came out of the bio-warfare lab at Plum Island.
[01:45:00.791 --> 01:45:07.717]  Likewise, West Nile disease clearly came out of the bio-warfare lab at Plum Island.
[01:45:07.937 --> 01:45:13.741]  So like you tried to author the thing, it got picked up as law, why don't everybody just agree to stop this?
[01:45:14.382 --> 01:45:20.887]  Like you said, they're creating super bio-weapons for threats that don't exist, creating the very weapon that creates the threat.
[01:45:22.338 --> 01:45:23.258]  You're exactly right.
[01:45:23.318 --> 01:45:31.401]  That's what I tried to do with my Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act by making this punishable by life imprisonment.
[01:45:31.461 --> 01:45:32.981]  I don't believe in the death penalty.
[01:45:33.021 --> 01:45:34.342]  They wanted to put that in there.
[01:45:34.802 --> 01:45:38.423]  And I said, no, I don't want the death penalty in my legislation.
[01:45:38.883 --> 01:45:42.024]  I thought I would send a message.
[01:45:42.785 --> 01:45:42.845]  I'm
[01:46:00.289 --> 01:46:00.690]  Stay there.
[01:46:00.710 --> 01:46:01.551]  Stay there.
[01:46:01.571 --> 01:46:02.992]  I want to ask why.
[01:46:03.012 --> 01:46:04.073]  For me, it's because...
[01:46:21.653 --> 01:46:23.254]  No, I agree, but who's behind it?
[01:46:23.294 --> 01:46:24.234]  These people that want to play God.
[01:46:24.274 --> 01:46:30.116]  It's like the Air Force says they have theoretically created antimatter 15 years ago in a press conference, 16 years ago.
[01:46:31.417 --> 01:46:35.318]  That's evil to me, is to create something that can kill everybody for no reason.
[01:46:35.378 --> 01:46:38.180]  Instead, you work with people and say, we're not doing this.
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:43.181]  I don't understand why we can't come together and not have this Atlantis moment where we blow ourselves up.
[01:46:43.221 --> 01:46:44.022]  Let's talk about that.
[01:46:44.662 --> 01:46:49.845]  You know, Plato said that Atlantis existed and was out in the Atlantic Ocean and blew up and they had free energy and flying ships.
[01:46:50.185 --> 01:46:50.986]  I don't know if that was real.
[01:46:51.706 --> 01:46:53.828]  We've got basically free energy now and flying ships.
[01:46:54.188 --> 01:47:00.652]  And I don't know why, as we approach God-like power, we don't have God-like minds, why we're going to blow ourselves up again.
[01:47:00.712 --> 01:47:04.434]  But if Atlantis wasn't real, it was our psychic understanding it was about to be.
[01:47:04.814 --> 01:47:12.319]  Because we're building the Atlantis moment when we blow ourselves to Timbuktu for no damn reason because a bunch of people are on a power trip.
[01:47:13.888 --> 01:47:16.890]  Well, I appreciate the callers holding, especially all the callers.
[01:47:17.110 --> 01:47:21.413]  Most of you want to talk about coronavirus, so Dr. Boyle has agreed to take your calls next hour.
[01:47:21.534 --> 01:47:22.514]  That's in about 30 minutes.
[01:47:22.554 --> 01:47:24.135]  If you'll stay on hold, we'll get to all of you.
[01:47:24.155 --> 01:47:30.880]  We really appreciate you, and you bring up a lot of novel, original questions that are important for us to try to answer as best we can.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.261]  We're all just trying to suss this out.
[01:47:32.622 --> 01:47:36.905]  None of us have the answer, but Dr. Boyle is as close as you're going to get to the answer on that.
[01:47:38.846 --> 01:47:40.687]  I almost feel opportunistic
[01:47:41.693 --> 01:47:49.621]  When I'm positioned with the very nano-silver that the Pentagon and Homeland Security has said has been proven to take out SARS.
[01:47:50.662 --> 01:47:51.202]  But you know what?
[01:47:51.302 --> 01:47:52.403]  I've been selling it for years.
[01:47:52.784 --> 01:47:54.986]  Because I go out and find out whatever the best product is.
[01:47:55.026 --> 01:47:56.067]  Show people this shot, please.
[01:47:57.268 --> 01:47:59.290]  So, that's what this comes down to.
[01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:04.215]  I sold out of this yesterday, as I told you, but still kept it discounted, the 16-ounce bottles.
[01:48:05.233 --> 01:48:10.301]  We're selling out of the one ounce bottles very, very quickly as well.
[01:48:10.321 --> 01:48:12.364]  A little spray bottle.
[01:48:13.462 --> 01:48:15.503]  This will sell out within a week, the three ounce bottles.
[01:48:15.644 --> 01:48:16.764]  And it's just high quality.
[01:48:17.265 --> 01:48:18.326]  And is it a silver bullet?
[01:48:18.346 --> 01:48:25.351]  No, but they call it a silver bullet in lore, because silver is just a metal-based antibiotic type system.
[01:48:26.171 --> 01:48:27.652]  And again, it's not perfect.
[01:48:27.732 --> 01:48:28.713]  Consult your physician.
[01:48:29.554 --> 01:48:32.616]  It's something that I normally just gargle with a couple times a week.
[01:48:33.416 --> 01:48:35.358]  But you can actually, this is approved to drink.
[01:48:36.098 --> 01:48:37.820]  That's why it's at 15 parts, but it's nano.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.181]  But just remember, any
[01:48:40.450 --> 01:48:45.586]  Antibiotic, whether it's the classic antibiotics or whether it's metals based has its downside as well.
[01:48:47.025 --> 01:48:50.046]  My dad was basically on death's doorstep six years ago.
[01:48:50.506 --> 01:48:55.687]  My uncle, his uncle, and my cousin had all died, lived at the same ranch, from the same bad pneumonia.
[01:48:56.367 --> 01:48:58.028]  I came in when the doctors couldn't help my dad.
[01:48:58.048 --> 01:48:59.208]  He'd been on three different antibiotics.
[01:48:59.828 --> 01:49:04.389]  I could tell he was going the same way, and I just basically assaulted him and poured three bottles of colloidal silver down him.
[01:49:04.809 --> 01:49:06.010]  Well, this was even better than that.
[01:49:06.050 --> 01:49:07.610]  By the way, my dad pissed green for a week.
[01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:10.571]  Sure, it wasn't good for his liver and kidneys, but he came back and lived, okay?
[01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:11.972]  I'm not saying that did that.
[01:49:12.452 --> 01:49:14.934]  I just didn't put it in God's hands.
[01:49:14.974 --> 01:49:17.135]  I took action because God helps those that help themselves.
[01:49:17.696 --> 01:49:20.958]  So what I'm getting at here is we're selling out of this silver.
[01:49:20.998 --> 01:49:22.119]  We're keeping it discounted.
[01:49:22.179 --> 01:49:23.500]  We're sold out of the colloil silver.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:24.661]  That hadn't come back in yet.
[01:49:24.681 --> 01:49:27.342]  It was already sold out before this crisis began.
[01:49:27.382 --> 01:49:29.704]  We have the great storable foods in case you've got a shelter in place.
[01:49:30.144 --> 01:49:32.866]  But I have that just because you should be self-sufficient and ready.
[01:49:33.206 --> 01:49:35.788]  All the other big suppliers we know of have already sold out.
[01:49:36.088 --> 01:49:37.049]  They're still taking your orders.
[01:49:37.509 --> 01:49:38.110]  Our supplier
[01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:39.291]  Has the food.
[01:49:39.331 --> 01:49:40.252]  They've got to package it.
[01:49:40.412 --> 01:49:44.216]  And they called me two days ago and said, you got to tell listeners it's now 10 to 14.
[01:49:44.717 --> 01:49:45.518]  And I said, is it really 10 to 14?
[01:49:45.678 --> 01:49:48.741]  They said, yeah, in a few days, it'll start being 10 days.
[01:49:48.781 --> 01:49:51.985]  And then, you know, we've got the food, but it's just it's increasing.
[01:49:52.045 --> 01:49:53.567]  Institutional buyers are trying to buy it up.
[01:49:53.847 --> 01:49:54.988]  And that's what scares them.
[01:49:55.409 --> 01:49:59.493]  I had talks two weeks ago with the owner and the founder and the CEO and all that.
[01:50:00.584 --> 01:50:04.166]  And they're just like, do you think we should keep buying more food or should we just sell out?
[01:50:04.186 --> 01:50:04.907]  What do you think we should do?
[01:50:04.927 --> 01:50:06.708]  Because it's hard to buy food when it goes up in price.
[01:50:07.088 --> 01:50:09.830]  And I said, I believe you should put everything you have into buying more food.
[01:50:10.210 --> 01:50:11.531]  I believe this is probably real.
[01:50:11.631 --> 01:50:12.812]  I don't want to tell my audience that.
[01:50:12.972 --> 01:50:13.693]  Let's wait and see.
[01:50:13.713 --> 01:50:15.194]  But they'll have food they eat anyways.
[01:50:15.934 --> 01:50:18.916]  And sure enough, unfortunately, you see this is serious.
[01:50:18.956 --> 01:50:20.557]  So, it's good to be prepared.
[01:50:20.917 --> 01:50:21.937]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:50:21.998 --> 01:50:24.059]  It funds our independent Maverick operation.
[01:50:24.399 --> 01:50:25.039]  It's storable food.
[01:50:25.079 --> 01:50:25.720]  It's high quality.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.861]  And we have the best nano silver you're going to find out there.
[01:50:28.881 --> 01:50:31.883]  I mean, the super silver wound gel is the same nano, but it's super strong.
[01:50:31.903 --> 01:50:32.864]  You can't ingest this.
[01:50:33.224 --> 01:50:34.765]  This is private labeled in stores.
[01:50:35.245 --> 01:50:36.266]  They have this in hospitals.
[01:50:36.586 --> 01:50:37.686]  These are great patriots.
[01:50:37.706 --> 01:50:38.767]  And here's the company right here.
[01:50:39.047 --> 01:50:39.948]  They want their name said.
[01:50:39.968 --> 01:50:45.391]  I've been with them like six, seven years, but it's American Biotech Labs out of Colorado.
[01:50:45.851 --> 01:50:52.278]  Here's all the Pentagon documents, Department of the Army, Headquarters Army, Homeland Security, A&M, talking about how amazing it is.
[01:50:52.318 --> 01:50:53.139]  Is it a silver bullet?
[01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:53.319]  No.
[01:50:54.301 --> 01:50:56.542]  But it's just one more defense and it funds the M4.
[01:50:56.562 --> 01:50:58.142]  All right, you've got the floor.
[01:50:58.202 --> 01:51:00.002]  I know it's an ad, then I broke again.
[01:51:01.663 --> 01:51:03.343]  Till the end of the hour, just go with it.
[01:51:04.323 --> 01:51:08.865]  All these notes you sent me here about, you already alluded to it, U.S.
[01:51:08.905 --> 01:51:10.945]  groups have already engineered the exact same thing.
[01:51:11.385 --> 01:51:14.386]  Bill and Melinda Gates having something similar through a subgroup patented.
[01:51:16.226 --> 01:51:18.567]  What you think Trump's doing wrong here, please.
[01:51:19.707 --> 01:51:21.027]  We got six minutes of this segment.
[01:51:21.368 --> 01:51:21.908]  Ten in the next.
[01:51:21.948 --> 01:51:22.568]  You've got the floor.
[01:51:22.628 --> 01:51:22.968]  Take over.
[01:51:24.443 --> 01:51:24.643]  Right.
[01:51:24.723 --> 01:51:27.006]  Well, as I said first, it's a question of money.
[01:51:27.126 --> 01:51:39.438]  I crunched the numbers, and after 9-11-2001, not counting anything before that, up until 2015, the United States government has wasted
[01:51:40.178 --> 01:51:47.366]  Over $100 billion on research, development, and testing biological warfare agents.
[01:51:47.827 --> 01:51:56.236]  So that's what has induced these 13,000 death scientists to feed at the trough, as I call them.
[01:51:56.276 --> 01:51:58.238]  They're Dr. Mengele types.
[01:51:58.398 --> 01:52:00.300]  And again, I haven't had a chance to
[01:52:01.321 --> 01:52:08.505]  Yeah, recrunch all the numbers, but it's about 5 billion per year since then, maybe a sum total of $120 billion.
[01:52:08.986 --> 01:52:11.407]  Now, to put that into perspective,
[01:52:12.117 --> 01:52:24.909]  As of 2015, in constant dollars, we had spent, retrospectively, $40 billion on the Manhattan Project to develop and use the atom bomb.
[01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:27.432]  So that's really what is going on here.
[01:52:28.132 --> 01:52:34.939]  We have an offensive biowarfare industry here in the United States that goes back
[01:52:35.679 --> 01:52:37.001]  At least to Reagan.
[01:52:37.201 --> 01:52:39.403]  I haven't gotten the figures for that.
[01:52:39.923 --> 01:52:41.224]  So it's greed.
[01:52:41.525 --> 01:52:46.369]  And the fact is, we do not train our scientists in ethics.
[01:52:47.110 --> 01:52:48.211]  They have no ethics at all.
[01:52:48.251 --> 01:52:53.776]  You know, these life scientists have all the ethics of Dr. Mengele, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:52:54.176 --> 01:52:56.078]  Now we get to President Trump.
[01:52:56.178 --> 01:52:59.401]  And here, Alex, I understand, you know, people have
[01:52:59.941 --> 01:53:02.162]  No, I totally agree, but let Trump have it if you want to.
[01:53:02.202 --> 01:53:03.103]  We respect you.
[01:53:19.608 --> 01:53:19.808]  Right.
[01:53:20.269 --> 01:53:24.515]  But I've always been a political independent.
[01:53:25.036 --> 01:53:30.403]  Well, for that reason, I did not vote for President Trump and I did not vote for Mrs. Clinton.
[01:53:30.443 --> 01:53:33.768]  I picked a third party candidate, which is usually what I do.
[01:53:34.248 --> 01:53:35.931]  What I think happened here
[01:53:37.308 --> 01:53:56.245]  In this call by President Trump with President Xi of China, where President Trump gave his endorsement to President Xi, and I've already expressed my opinion, Xi is lying through his teeth and has always been from the outset.
[01:53:57.065 --> 01:53:59.406]  I'm personally not blaming President Trump.
[01:53:59.566 --> 01:54:13.871]  I think he has the swamp creature scientists advising him on this, and I suspect these people are up to their eyeballs in this dirty biological warfare work.
[01:54:14.312 --> 01:54:20.434]  For example, the Center for Disease Control, they're the Center for Disease Proliferation.
[01:54:21.315 --> 01:54:37.991]  I won't go through the long history here, but as you know, back under the Reagan administration, CDC and American Tide Culture Collection, which is supposed to be a scientific outfit, shipped, sent 40 different shipments
[01:54:38.812 --> 01:54:51.056]  Of weapon-specific biological agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these things and use them against Iran.
[01:54:51.236 --> 01:54:56.937]  On record, not debated, and a bunch of mustard gas and the satellites how to use it.
[01:54:57.557 --> 01:55:01.119]  And all that's documented in my book here, Biowarfare and Terrorism.
[01:55:01.159 --> 01:55:02.639]  You can read it with citation.
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:08.884]  Unfortunately, what happened when the war ended, the U.S.
[01:55:08.944 --> 01:55:20.033]  Army was sent in there to clean up the mess, and they demolished the biological and chemical weapons facilities there, and there was blowback.
[01:55:21.414 --> 01:55:22.836]  Let me ask you this.
[01:55:22.896 --> 01:55:27.861]  Was it Saddam launching some of the weapons or just blowing up the bunkers?
[01:55:36.313 --> 01:55:39.075]  No, there's no evidence he launched biological weapons.
[01:55:39.215 --> 01:55:45.638]  It appears it was blowing up the bunkers and that blew back on our own troops.
[01:55:46.338 --> 01:55:49.800]  We have Gulf War Syndrome and 11,000 are dead, over 100,000.
[01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:57.024]  Yeah, because I'm no weapons expert, but everybody knows from the old days of plague, you burn biologicals, you don't blow them up.
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:59.561]  Right, they blew them up.
[01:55:59.781 --> 01:56:06.625]  But to get back to President Trump, he's got advisors around there from National Institutes of Health.
[01:56:06.925 --> 01:56:08.326]  Well, that's a joke and a fraud.
[01:56:08.726 --> 01:56:18.712]  They have been funding these BSL-4 facilities, this gain-of-function work that is only useful for
[01:56:19.392 --> 01:56:28.637]  Uh, biological warfare, uh, purposes, offensive... Alright, then let's ask you when we come back, how bad you think it'll get if you're saying it so serious, and what do you expect to happen next?
[01:56:28.657 --> 01:56:31.439]  Dr. Francis Boyle, top bioweapons expert, straight ahead.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.802]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:56:37.563 --> 01:56:38.983]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:56:43.886 --> 01:56:46.588]  So, just because Xi Jinping is using
[01:56:48.214 --> 01:56:52.256]  All of this to crack down on people doesn't mean he did it to do that.
[01:56:52.856 --> 01:56:56.198]  And the smart money's all that this was a bioweapon actually released.
[01:56:56.819 --> 01:57:02.101]  Make no mistake, the hysterical response you've seen with them saying, be calm, is a sign you should be concerned.
[01:57:02.141 --> 01:57:08.405]  Normally when it's some drill, they hype up something that's basically harmless or close to it, except for really rundown people.
[01:57:09.707 --> 01:57:10.788]  To get power and control.
[01:57:11.529 --> 01:57:12.791]  But there's real fear.
[01:57:12.831 --> 01:57:14.593]  You know, you hear Xi Jinping's all on top of it.
[01:57:14.613 --> 01:57:15.914]  He's not been on TV in weeks.
[01:57:16.735 --> 01:57:19.098]  Because they understand there's that image of him associated with failure.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.404]  Dr. Francis Boyle, who authored the U.S.
[01:57:24.464 --> 01:57:28.248]  Bioweapons Act, became in mainstay of the big world treaty on it.
[01:57:29.226 --> 01:57:32.348]  He's represented world leaders at the Hague, you name it.
[01:57:32.368 --> 01:57:34.309]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he's prestigious.
[01:57:34.329 --> 01:57:36.410]  And he's a very credible guy.
[01:57:36.450 --> 01:57:37.670]  Doesn't mean you agree with everything he says.
[01:57:37.690 --> 01:57:38.911]  I don't agree with everything I say sometimes.
[01:57:38.971 --> 01:57:40.712]  I hear it later and say, well, I should have said it this way.
[01:57:40.752 --> 01:57:47.275]  But let's just say he is a competent person who has integrity and who really is his own person.
[01:57:47.675 --> 01:57:48.976]  In this universe, that's all there is.
[01:57:49.276 --> 01:57:50.897]  I am my own person, my own captain.
[01:57:51.357 --> 01:57:53.358]  Sometimes I go, God, I did a terrible job there.
[01:57:53.378 --> 01:57:54.158]  I just wrecked the ship.
[01:57:54.178 --> 01:57:55.979]  But I'm the one running the show.
[01:57:56.019 --> 01:57:56.679]  Everybody knows it.
[01:57:56.699 --> 01:57:57.199]  You can feel it.
[01:57:57.219 --> 01:57:57.739]  You can see it.
[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:01.141]  And I just wonder who is running the ship here.
[01:58:01.201 --> 01:58:06.823]  Because, again, I see, and I can pull these quotes up, the UN World Health Organization head
[01:58:07.583 --> 01:58:25.927]  And others saying, great job, Xi Jinping, incredible job, you know, shooting people at checkpoints, and locking down cities, and grabbing people, and mass graves, and burning bodies, and then telling us much lower numbers, and then we don't let flights in, finally, after everybody else, like, this is very xenophobic, the UN says, and you should let us in.
[01:58:26.347 --> 01:58:33.469]  How do they expect any, down to, not just a nurse, not a doctor, not a professor, but the general public to go, wait a minute,
[01:58:34.966 --> 01:58:37.608]  You're gonna kill people at checkpoints, but it's no big deal.
[01:58:39.489 --> 01:58:40.990]  That's like end-of-the-world type stuff.
[01:58:42.031 --> 01:58:47.194]  And then you're gonna tell us we've got to keep the flights open and just have people fly here.
[01:58:48.055 --> 01:58:48.896]  What's the answer?
[01:58:48.936 --> 01:58:52.478]  What's the key to that oxymoronical statement that's coming out?
[01:58:52.498 --> 01:58:53.819]  What's behind that, Dr. Boyle?
[01:58:55.239 --> 01:59:00.243]  Well, I wanted, Alex, let me repeat or finish my comment there about President Trump.
[01:59:00.683 --> 01:59:07.889]  So his science advisors that he has are up to their eyeballs in this dirty biological warfare work.
[01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:14.734]  And so they have not given him, in my opinion, proper advice as to what is going on here.
[01:59:15.275 --> 01:59:26.923]  Otherwise, I don't believe he would have spoken with President Xi and commended him and given him his imprimatur.
[01:59:27.363 --> 01:59:37.490]  So, in my opinion, President Trump needs to fire each and every one of these swamp creature scientists that he has advising him.
[01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:56.159]  And bring in some outside independent experts who have never accepted one dime of dirty biological warfare work from any agency of the United States government, and whose institutions have never accepted one dime.
[01:59:56.599 --> 02:00:05.503]  Because if their institutions have, they will be spinning things in favor of maintaining this BSL-3, BSL-4 facilities.
[02:00:06.884 --> 02:00:09.607]  To give you an example, this is St.
[02:00:09.667 --> 02:00:13.352]  Jude Hospital, founded by Danny Thomas.
[02:00:13.852 --> 02:00:19.398]  They have their own BSL-4 biological warfare laboratory there.
[02:00:19.438 --> 02:00:20.600]  That's not life-giving.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:21.261]  Exactly.
[02:00:21.681 --> 02:00:27.787]  Developing bioweapons is not, and again, is this the 12th monkey depopulationist cult at work?
[02:00:27.827 --> 02:00:34.513]  Because, as you know, 20 years ago they released the mousepox system so anybody could make it and people said, why are you doing that?
[02:00:34.953 --> 02:00:40.138]  Why are they giving out promethean fire to destroy humanity like they're lollipops?
[02:00:43.385 --> 02:00:49.511]  I've been fighting against this since the early 1980s, Alex.
[02:00:49.691 --> 02:00:50.512]  What can I say?
[02:00:50.592 --> 02:00:55.176]  That's why I called for and drafted it and helped get lobbied through Congress.
[02:00:55.957 --> 02:00:57.018]  No, I know, I know.
[02:00:57.118 --> 02:01:03.304]  I'm asking the mindset of these people, because you said, oh, these average so-called life scientists are minglers.
[02:01:03.824 --> 02:01:04.385]  Exactly.
[02:01:04.405 --> 02:01:07.528]  I mean, I remember when Eric Bianca came out when I made Endgame and he said,
[02:01:07.968 --> 02:01:10.189]  We want to reduce the world's population by 90 percent.
[02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:11.010]  Airborne Ebola.
[02:01:11.050 --> 02:01:13.251]  The Texas Academy of Sciences gave him a standing ovation.
[02:01:13.672 --> 02:01:14.732]  We showed all that on air.
[02:01:15.373 --> 02:01:19.355]  And then I had his research scientist that had graduated decades before threatening me.
[02:01:19.475 --> 02:01:22.297]  And they were in the news saying, Pianka's too liberal.
[02:01:22.437 --> 02:01:23.697]  All humans must die.
[02:01:23.718 --> 02:01:27.680]  And I looked up the one woman and she works in a level 4 bioweapons lab.
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:31.102]  She's saying, I want to kill everybody like the guy from 12th Monkeys.
[02:01:31.482 --> 02:01:33.303]  And she works in a bioweapons lab.
[02:01:33.423 --> 02:01:34.344]  This is insane!
[02:01:35.546 --> 02:01:51.011]  Well, Alex, as you know, this is the eugenics movement that started here in America and that was picked up by Hitler and the Nazis and applied to the Jews and to the Roma.
[02:01:53.453 --> 02:02:06.188]  So the world's being teed up where everybody's got bioweapons and everybody's got vaccines for them, so there's plausible deniability.
[02:02:06.228 --> 02:02:09.492]  It sounds like to me, how do you cover up where it came from?
[02:02:09.992 --> 02:02:17.273]  Well, under the name of vaccine, you hand it out everywhere because the vaccine is basically identical to the pathogen itself.
[02:02:17.713 --> 02:02:21.774]  That's how you escape accountability is you hand it out everywhere.
[02:02:23.134 --> 02:02:23.654]  That's correct.
[02:02:23.754 --> 02:02:29.655]  And most of these vaccines, Alex, actually have live agents in them.
[02:02:29.976 --> 02:02:33.416]  That's what the dual use is all about.
[02:02:34.116 --> 02:02:38.037]  For example, these so-called the West African Ebola
[02:02:38.906 --> 02:02:41.027]  A disaster over there.
[02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:42.607]  That came out of the U.S.
[02:02:42.647 --> 02:02:51.790]  government lab there at Kenema, and that was being run by Fort Detrick and the Broad Institute at Harvard and MIT.
[02:02:52.290 --> 02:02:57.412]  And it appears they were testing out an Ebola vaccine and giving people live Ebola.
[02:02:57.952 --> 02:03:00.493]  So yeah, that's exactly
[02:03:01.674 --> 02:03:04.097]  What is going on here, Alex?
[02:03:04.337 --> 02:03:16.873]  It's pretty much a Nazi eugenic mentality by these agencies of the United States government, by these 13,000 or more life scientists.
[02:03:17.013 --> 02:03:18.495]  I call them death scientists.
[02:03:18.995 --> 02:03:20.377]  And it's all a question of money.
[02:03:20.737 --> 02:03:30.566]  You know, everyone can be bought off, and none of these scientists have been given basic training in ethics, in scientific ethics.
[02:03:30.586 --> 02:03:31.747]  And they're all compartmentalized.
[02:03:31.787 --> 02:03:32.408]  They don't know.
[02:03:33.009 --> 02:03:35.111]  They just have a silly compartmentalized attitude.
[02:03:35.131 --> 02:03:38.193]  Speaking of compartmentalization, who would you say is the kingpin?
[02:03:38.213 --> 02:03:41.336]  From my research, I know this is dangerous, but you do this.
[02:03:42.501 --> 02:03:55.574]  I see Bill Gates and his dad, the head of Planned Parenthood and Cold Springs Harbor and the eugenics, as at the center of the web, given all that power, put in by IBM that pledged its whole wealth, you know, after Hitler failed, to the eugenics project that's on record.
[02:03:55.954 --> 02:04:02.641]  I see Bill Gates as the spider right at the center of the web, the chief science officer of this operation, the Emperor Palpatine.
[02:04:04.209 --> 02:04:07.310]  Well, I wouldn't say he's the emperor.
[02:04:07.690 --> 02:04:16.412]  I think the real problem predated Gates going back to the Reagan administration under the influence of the neocons.
[02:04:16.432 --> 02:04:17.152]  Henry Kissinger?
[02:04:17.172 --> 02:04:21.373]  State Department Memorandum 200?
[02:04:21.413 --> 02:04:27.294]  The depopulation, the Kissinger Memorandum, which I have read.
[02:04:27.914 --> 02:04:33.076]  That depopulation should be an objective of U.S.
[02:04:33.136 --> 02:04:34.537]  national security policy.
[02:04:34.557 --> 02:04:38.798]  And as I told you, I went through the exact same Ph.D.
[02:04:38.858 --> 02:04:44.521]  program at Harvard that produced Kissinger before me, deliberately, just to see how these people think it worked.
[02:04:45.081 --> 02:04:52.384]  And they even gave me Kissinger's old office for one year when I was an associate at Harvard's
[02:04:54.365 --> 02:04:56.888]  No, you did a great job infiltrating Mordor.
[02:04:56.988 --> 02:05:00.792]  So, prime approximation here, how bad is this going to get?
[02:05:00.812 --> 02:05:02.754]  I agree with you it's really serious.
[02:05:04.295 --> 02:05:08.459]  If the public health services break down, they can't cover it up, then it creates more hysteria.
[02:05:08.479 --> 02:05:09.961]  I think that's happening in China.
[02:05:10.261 --> 02:05:13.044]  From your sources at the UN, from your own research, how bad is this?
[02:05:14.915 --> 02:05:22.341]  Well, Alex, you had this so-called tabletop computer game at Johns Hopkins.
[02:05:22.421 --> 02:05:23.321]  Oh, Bill Gates again.
[02:05:23.621 --> 02:05:24.262]  65 million dead.
[02:05:24.882 --> 02:05:25.943]  That's correct.
[02:05:26.223 --> 02:05:35.810]  And Johns Hopkins is a well-known center for the neocons who fully support biological weapons and even ethnic-specific biological weapons.
[02:05:36.251 --> 02:05:39.873]  You can read that in their PNAC report.
[02:05:40.374 --> 02:05:43.196]  That tabletop exercise, which is really a war game,
[02:05:44.632 --> 02:05:46.873]  Resulted in 65 million deaths.
[02:05:48.274 --> 02:05:57.317]  That's the only figure I have seen that seems to be credible as to where this could lead.
[02:05:57.377 --> 02:06:02.639]  I mean, we could be dealing with something here as bad as the Spanish flu virus.
[02:06:02.839 --> 02:06:06.340]  I lost a grandmother a century ago to the Spanish flu virus.
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:07.521]  So that, Alex,
[02:06:08.261 --> 02:06:10.342]  I guess it's a worst case scenario.
[02:06:10.462 --> 02:06:14.983]  I'm not here to scare anyone or get anyone to panic.
[02:06:15.163 --> 02:06:18.363]  I'm just trying to give you the best analysis I can.
[02:06:18.403 --> 02:06:19.064]  Well, I agree.
[02:06:19.184 --> 02:06:22.584]  My gut, well, you've been on for 15 or 20 years with us and you've always been accurate.
[02:06:22.784 --> 02:06:23.405]  You tell the truth.
[02:06:23.445 --> 02:06:24.185]  That's what you go with.
[02:06:25.905 --> 02:06:28.746]  When things are so dangerous, I suddenly feel empowered.
[02:06:28.866 --> 02:06:31.486]  Not because I like it, because it's so real.
[02:06:31.526 --> 02:06:33.427]  I'm in fight mode and I feel that right now.
[02:06:34.446 --> 02:06:38.930]  Like, I just cannot impress upon people, Dr. Boyle, that I think these are very serious times.
[02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:39.310]  You agree?
[02:06:40.651 --> 02:06:51.060]  Right, Alex, that's why I've come on your show, that you've always given me, despite whatever people criticize you, you've always given me a fair interview and let me say what I want to say.
[02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:54.282]  No, that's why they demonize us, because we're an open forum for real people.
[02:06:54.663 --> 02:06:56.384]  Speaking of that, phone calls are coming up.
[02:06:56.884 --> 02:06:57.865]  Hour 4, straight ahead.
[02:06:57.885 --> 02:06:58.386]  Stay with us.
[02:07:00.191 --> 02:07:02.993]  All right, we've got Dr. Francis Boyle with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:07:03.013 --> 02:07:06.956]  We appreciate him carving out time as a professor of law up in Illinois to go over this.
[02:07:07.016 --> 02:07:08.357]  He is the creator of the U.S.
[02:07:08.377 --> 02:07:19.244]  Bioweapons Act and many other big world systems, and he knows the insiders, and he knows who the players are, and he's sticking his neck out there because he's not sticking his neck out.
[02:07:19.584 --> 02:07:24.387]  It's self-preservation to stand up against the soulless madness
[02:07:25.536 --> 02:07:26.757]  I don't know.
[02:07:43.464 --> 02:07:44.245]  They were involved.
[02:07:44.905 --> 02:07:51.769]  And that's what I see, that's what he sees, and that's what really concerns me is we need to let the globalists know they're going to be held accountable.
[02:07:52.010 --> 02:07:57.093]  We're going to go to break in a few minutes, come back and take phone calls for folks who have been patiently holding, and they are lucky to talk to you.
[02:07:57.113 --> 02:07:59.815]  I know you're not a braggadocious guy, but you're a busy person.
[02:07:59.855 --> 02:08:01.876]  I'm lucky to talk to you, and we're lucky to even be here on the air.
[02:08:02.456 --> 02:08:09.421]  But just in closing on the time we have just alone before we get calls, what else do you want to quantify for listeners and viewers about what's happening right now?
[02:08:12.017 --> 02:08:35.005]  Well, the main message I have for your viewing audience is that you must get through to President Trump, fire all of his so-called swamp creature science advisors, and convince President Trump to bring in outside independent experts
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:42.985]  To give him proper advice as to how to protect the public health of the American people.
[02:08:43.526 --> 02:08:56.455]  Because all these scientists and institutions and everything else have not, back starting since 9-11-2001 with that anthrax attack, they came out of a U.S.
[02:08:56.515 --> 02:08:59.197]  government biological warfare lab.
[02:08:59.277 --> 02:09:03.881]  They have been researching, developing, testing, and stockpiling
[02:09:04.502 --> 02:09:13.240]  Every type of hideous biological weapon you can imagine, and indeed there is still a stockpile
[02:09:13.943 --> 02:09:26.450]  Of that super weapons-grade anthrax, the Amerithrax, that was inflicted on the American people and Congress in October of 2001.
[02:09:27.970 --> 02:09:29.611]  So that is what we are facing.
[02:09:30.071 --> 02:09:39.456]  And President Trump must immediately order the total shutdown, not review, but shutdown, of all BSL-4 and BSL-3 labs
[02:09:41.435 --> 02:09:48.122]  Here in the United States, all this gain-of-function research has to stop.
[02:09:48.902 --> 02:09:50.144]  Explain gain-of-function.
[02:09:50.624 --> 02:10:01.094]  They have to make the weapon to have the cure, which then everybody else has to do it, which causes an arms race in bioweapons, which is the definition of just satanic evil.
[02:10:02.293 --> 02:10:02.533]  Right.
[02:10:02.673 --> 02:10:07.618]  And the gain of function means that they take a biological weapon that they already have.
[02:10:08.139 --> 02:10:13.924]  And I believe that's what we're dealing here with the Wuhan 4 facility.
[02:10:14.284 --> 02:10:18.909]  SARS was already a biological weapon that had leaked out of that facility.
[02:10:19.349 --> 02:10:21.271]  It was weaponized coronavirus.
[02:10:21.731 --> 02:10:24.194]  And they take that weapon they already have
[02:10:24.794 --> 02:10:34.037]  And they then used DNA genetic engineering and now synthetic biology to make it more lethal and more infectious.
[02:10:34.157 --> 02:10:44.060]  Indeed, the entire synthetic biology industry and all these synthetic biologists was set up by the Pentagon and DARPA.
[02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:47.864]  The Defense Advanced Research Program.
[02:10:48.244 --> 02:10:52.468]  They're the ones who funded this for biological weapons purposes.
[02:10:52.949 --> 02:11:02.539]  And the proof of that is that when the first conference of these synthetic biologists met and they produced a report,
[02:11:02.779 --> 02:11:03.780]  All right, stay there.
[02:11:21.111 --> 02:11:25.495]  I want to talk about where you think this is going, how bad it's going to get, because you didn't dodge that.
[02:11:25.515 --> 02:11:27.196]  You wanted to finish your last point, last segment.
[02:11:27.577 --> 02:11:30.699]  I want to hit that and then go to calls with Dr. Francis Boyle, one of the leading experts we could have on.
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:31.700]  Blessed to have him.
[02:11:32.401 --> 02:11:38.526]  And then I'm not a guy that shoots my mouth off about physical stuff, but any biological weapon hurts my family.
[02:11:38.626 --> 02:11:41.769]  I'm going to hold bureaucrats and life sciences accountable.
[02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:44.331]  All right, Dr. Francis Boyle is our guest.
[02:11:44.351 --> 02:11:45.512]  He'll leave us in about two segments.
[02:11:45.532 --> 02:11:48.935]  We're going to take some phone calls for him right now, but he authored
[02:11:50.885 --> 02:11:56.090]  The US Bioweapons Act that got adopted by the UN, he wanted live in prison for people that develop this type of stuff.
[02:11:57.151 --> 02:12:02.836]  All I'm saying is, you go up and shoot my family member in the head, I'm gonna go to the courts, you're gonna get justice.
[02:12:03.316 --> 02:12:06.339]  You do it in some sophisticated bioweapon, we're not even set up to deal with that.
[02:12:06.959 --> 02:12:16.508]  So I'm just telling all the live scientists that make comments on Facebook about there's too many people and our big leftists that are all into this stuff right now, and they're neo-Malthusians,
[02:12:17.495 --> 02:12:21.118]  This stuff comes out, it hurts my family, it's not a threat, it's not acting tough.
[02:12:21.598 --> 02:12:23.260]  I'm gonna just hold you responsible.
[02:12:25.001 --> 02:12:26.162]  This is not me acting tough.
[02:12:26.242 --> 02:12:27.683]  As a man, I've just got to be honest.
[02:12:28.044 --> 02:12:32.247]  It's time you know, globalist, that I'm done with your crap.
[02:12:32.827 --> 02:12:34.228]  And the listeners need to be done as well.
[02:12:34.969 --> 02:12:37.650]  And nobody ever says this stuff because they'll do a false flag against themselves.
[02:12:37.971 --> 02:12:41.513]  They won't do that here and then go, oh, they attacked us because we did the weapon.
[02:12:42.033 --> 02:12:44.394]  They need to know that we understand this is a covert weapon.
[02:12:44.834 --> 02:12:46.135]  It's a eugenics-based system.
[02:12:46.275 --> 02:12:49.577]  It's the same group that created the Nazis as a beta test.
[02:12:50.217 --> 02:12:51.598]  The same group that ran IBM.
[02:12:51.898 --> 02:12:52.558]  They're behind this.
[02:12:52.698 --> 02:12:55.200]  And they need to know we know their number.
[02:12:56.331 --> 02:12:59.636]  And they better not pull any more of this crap.
[02:13:00.057 --> 02:13:02.300]  And this is defensive, because we know what this is.
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:03.522]  We know it's manufactured.
[02:13:03.983 --> 02:13:04.824]  It's out of control.
[02:13:05.345 --> 02:13:06.467]  And all these labs have it.
[02:13:06.587 --> 02:13:07.448]  It's leaked out of U.S.
[02:13:07.508 --> 02:13:07.789]  labs.
[02:13:07.809 --> 02:13:08.870]  It's leaked out of Russian labs.
[02:13:09.171 --> 02:13:10.653]  And it's just insane.
[02:13:11.474 --> 02:13:20.363]  Can you comment just to the moral authority or what we do to get them to stop when common sense and laws that you've helped pass won't do it?
[02:13:20.703 --> 02:13:24.567]  What do we do when they won't follow the law and play games?
[02:13:24.887 --> 02:13:33.876]  What do we do when they create Promethean biological hydrogen bombs and are running around distributing them?
[02:13:36.127 --> 02:13:50.045]  Well, Alex, as I said, they tried very hard to get the death penalty into my Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act, and I resisted because I don't support the death penalty, so it's life in prison.
[02:13:50.085 --> 02:13:54.171]  But, you know, basically, under these circumstances,
[02:13:55.616 --> 02:14:00.099]  I just submit everyone has to do what his or her conscience tells them to do.
[02:14:00.719 --> 02:14:04.802]  I can't give you, you know, moral guidance or religious guidance.
[02:14:04.882 --> 02:14:06.483]  I'm a law professor, not a lawyer.
[02:14:07.063 --> 02:14:10.526]  So, you know, people have to decide this for themselves.
[02:14:10.566 --> 02:14:16.290]  But before we take questions, and I'm happy to take some questions, I know you're
[02:14:17.170 --> 02:14:21.092]  Viewers there have been quite patient listening to me for the last hour here.
[02:14:21.952 --> 02:14:35.898]  I can't stay forever, but I do want to make it clear that I have never worked the United States government as a matter of principle because of my opposition to the Vietnam War going back to when I was about 16.
[02:14:36.138 --> 02:14:40.300]  I have never had a security clearance
[02:14:41.033 --> 02:14:45.937]  I have no access to any secret information or anything like that.
[02:14:46.797 --> 02:14:54.463]  I'm just going through what I have seen in the public record and, you know, studying.
[02:14:54.623 --> 02:15:04.971]  I even studied biological warfare at Harvard with Matt Messelson, a Harvard biologist, and he was the one who convinced his colleague Kissinger
[02:15:05.583 --> 02:15:10.848]  And the two of them convinced Nixon to ratify the Biological Weapons Convention.
[02:15:11.208 --> 02:15:20.197]  Unfortunately, at that point, the Pentagon and the CIA took all their biological warfare work underground.
[02:15:20.757 --> 02:15:26.843]  So, I want to tell your viewers, I don't have answers to all your questions.
[02:15:28.113 --> 02:15:29.434]  That's not my job here.
[02:15:29.454 --> 02:15:34.938]  But even people like the President, it's all compartmentalized, don't know.
[02:15:35.259 --> 02:15:37.601]  Classified stuff's the biggest propaganda out there.
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:52.864]  Right, I believe that President Trump's call and endorsement to President Xi just indicates to me the scientists and advisors they have behind him are just feeding him a lot of bull twaddle.
[02:15:53.244 --> 02:15:57.365]  That's right, there's an international mad scientist eugenics conspiracy.
[02:15:57.666 --> 02:15:59.086]  That's what unifies the evil.
[02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:05.371]  Well, it seems, as I've said before... And China's the test project.
[02:16:05.391 --> 02:16:07.112]  Let's go to a few calls they've been holding for you.
[02:16:08.052 --> 02:16:11.413]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Question for guests.
[02:16:11.633 --> 02:16:12.573]  Ed in Utah.
[02:16:12.873 --> 02:16:15.214]  How did China Lab Scientist... No, go ahead.
[02:16:15.254 --> 02:16:15.894]  Your question, Ed.
[02:16:17.235 --> 02:16:19.675]  Yeah, how did... Hey, thanks a lot, gentlemen, for all you're doing.
[02:16:19.695 --> 02:16:21.916]  We're really blessed to have you guys.
[02:16:22.356 --> 02:16:29.078]  How did the lab China doctor there know that this was the coronavirus?
[02:16:30.362 --> 02:16:33.103]  In other words, the naming of the virus itself?
[02:16:35.805 --> 02:16:42.828]  Well, you know, coronavirus is a common virus for colds and all sorts of things like that, flu.
[02:16:43.188 --> 02:16:44.169]  Well, colds and whatever.
[02:16:44.229 --> 02:16:46.370]  Even dogs get coronavirus.
[02:16:46.410 --> 02:16:49.791]  So, it does appear that at this BSL-4 lab,
[02:16:51.767 --> 02:16:59.822]  Uh, they took a coronavirus and they DNA genetically engineered it into a biological weapon known as SARS.
[02:17:00.403 --> 02:17:02.707]  So SARS itself is already a
[02:17:04.202 --> 02:17:04.483]  I think?
[02:17:22.726 --> 02:17:28.228]  And the flu virus, and then they gave it these gain-of-function activities.
[02:17:28.568 --> 02:17:40.071]  So we're dealing here, Ed, with some type of super-duper biological weapon that we have never encountered before between you and me.
[02:17:40.132 --> 02:17:41.412]  I'm not trying to
[02:17:41.992 --> 02:17:44.633]  Scarietta, I'm just giving you my best assessment of the situation.
[02:17:44.673 --> 02:17:45.753]  All right, and we gotta jump.
[02:17:45.793 --> 02:17:46.333]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:46.373 --> 02:17:47.073]  We gotta move quick.
[02:17:47.473 --> 02:17:49.154]  I should add, NaturalNews.com is broken.
[02:17:49.174 --> 02:17:50.614]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[02:17:50.994 --> 02:17:51.414]  Breaking.
[02:17:51.975 --> 02:17:58.956]  China to quarantine city of Shenzhen in the province, causing mad rush to Hong Kong as infected citizens flee.
[02:17:59.336 --> 02:18:00.297]  He's got businesses there.
[02:18:00.317 --> 02:18:02.277]  Mike Adams has confirmed this is an exclusive.
[02:18:02.297 --> 02:18:06.058]  It's up on NaturalNews.com, NewsWars.com right now.
[02:18:06.118 --> 02:18:08.339]  That is huge breaking news right there.
[02:18:08.359 --> 02:18:09.899]  Dr. Boyle, that's pretty frightening.
[02:18:10.663 --> 02:18:11.784]  Let me respond to that.
[02:18:11.824 --> 02:18:17.589]  You see, this was reported immediately to President Xi, all right?
[02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:23.415]  And he understands exactly how dangerous this is, okay?
[02:18:23.875 --> 02:18:35.346]  And that is why he is taking the draconian measures that he has taken and is taking now to try to contain it.
[02:18:36.116 --> 02:18:37.276]  If this can be done.
[02:18:38.197 --> 02:18:40.137]  Otherwise they wouldn't be doing all this.
[02:18:40.217 --> 02:18:50.800]  Indeed, Xi knows full well that this threatens his regime and indeed the communist government over there in China.
[02:18:51.021 --> 02:18:52.561]  Doc, I'm not disagreeing with you.
[02:18:52.621 --> 02:18:55.462]  So now you're kind of saying that how is Trump wrong?
[02:18:55.502 --> 02:18:57.322]  Give us the nuance in praising Xi.
[02:18:59.223 --> 02:19:01.624]  I believe President Trump was misadvised.
[02:19:01.764 --> 02:19:04.905]  That under no circumstances... You're saying he's not being advised that it's a bioweapon.
[02:19:04.925 --> 02:19:05.525]  That's your problem.
[02:19:06.758 --> 02:19:07.299]  That's correct.
[02:19:07.479 --> 02:19:16.388]  I don't believe he has been advised that it is a bioweapon or that this is a turbocharged bioweapon.
[02:19:16.528 --> 02:19:18.650]  I just don't believe he understands it.
[02:19:19.471 --> 02:19:24.616]  The scientific advisors he has around him, you know, these are... No, very well said.
[02:19:24.656 --> 02:19:25.517]  I agree with your statement.
[02:19:26.098 --> 02:19:26.959]  Jordan in Oregon.
[02:19:26.999 --> 02:19:28.660]  Jordan, you're on the air with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:28.941]  Go ahead.
[02:19:31.038 --> 02:19:32.239]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:19:32.279 --> 02:19:34.580]  This is a question for Dr. Boyle and Alex.
[02:19:35.061 --> 02:19:37.142]  There's two prime suspects here, the U.S.
[02:19:37.162 --> 02:19:37.722]  and China.
[02:19:38.363 --> 02:19:39.804]  China is the deep state.
[02:19:40.264 --> 02:19:41.545]  We've got 13,000 U.S.
[02:19:41.905 --> 02:19:45.287]  scientists developing a bioweapon, spending $120 billion.
[02:19:46.348 --> 02:19:47.128]  It's got the U.S.
[02:19:47.168 --> 02:19:48.529]  fingerprints all over it.
[02:19:49.370 --> 02:19:58.936]  I think they're going to come out with a whistleblower when the death toll is high enough and there's enough chaos, and then the media is going to turn on Trump and America and blame this on Trump.
[02:19:59.819 --> 02:20:02.442]  And it'll let Gigi Payne save face.
[02:20:02.743 --> 02:20:10.112]  Yeah, could this be a false flag claiming a mad 12th monkey scientist in the US did this because they're angry at China?
[02:20:11.736 --> 02:20:16.778]  I did consider that alternative, Alex, and I'm glad you mentioned that.
[02:20:17.378 --> 02:20:22.640]  And while I was waiting these alternatives, I did not give interviews.
[02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:31.863]  It was only when I came to the conclusion, based on the long history of this BSL-4 lab, that it leaked out of there.
[02:20:32.363 --> 02:20:39.666]  But that being said, if this is some type of covert attack on China,
[02:20:40.579 --> 02:20:51.153]  I suspect President Xi knows that full well, and he will retaliate in kind upon whoever might be the culprit here.
[02:20:51.574 --> 02:20:54.979]  And I'm not saying who may or may not be the culprit.
[02:20:55.859 --> 02:20:57.220]  We have the capability.
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:20:58.821]  Canada has the capability.
[02:20:59.261 --> 02:21:00.902]  Japan has the capability.
[02:21:01.042 --> 02:21:02.523]  France has the capability.
[02:21:03.003 --> 02:21:04.484]  Britain has the capability.
[02:21:04.964 --> 02:21:06.305]  Israel has the capability.
[02:21:06.585 --> 02:21:10.627]  But I'm not, right now, my conclusion, it was a leak.
[02:21:11.948 --> 02:21:14.169]  I'll continue to evaluate.
[02:21:14.289 --> 02:21:16.790]  Sure, a vaccine development link makes perfect sense.
[02:21:16.830 --> 02:21:20.492]  They're creating something they know is being developed in Canada against them to defend themselves.
[02:21:20.853 --> 02:21:21.313]  It leaks out.
[02:21:22.668 --> 02:21:24.789]  Alright, final segment with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[02:21:24.829 --> 02:21:28.930]  I'll continue with your phone calls right through to the end of the hour and then Owen Schroer in the war room takes over.
[02:21:30.430 --> 02:21:34.291]  But we're talking about real world stuff and what about this, Dr. Boyle, before we go to a few calls?
[02:21:35.312 --> 02:21:42.314]  The media up front a month ago saying there will be no discussion about this virus when it wasn't even in the news.
[02:21:42.714 --> 02:21:44.514]  There'll be no questioning official statements.
[02:21:44.534 --> 02:21:46.695]  That was like what Xi Jinping was saying a month ago in China.
[02:21:47.597 --> 02:21:54.659]  And then anybody even covering what local Chinese news was saying, or Hong Kong news, would be shut down, like InfoWars or Natural News.
[02:21:54.719 --> 02:21:59.460]  But now it's been proven accurate, and that we're leading the news days or weeks ahead.
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:05.342]  That's when I really thought, hey, this looks pretty serious, but what about the lockstep corporate media in America?
[02:22:05.902 --> 02:22:09.023]  That doesn't create confidence if they're not honest about what's happening.
[02:22:09.043 --> 02:22:13.404]  I think that's what you're getting at, is Trump's like, it's under control, he's doing a great job.
[02:22:13.504 --> 02:22:16.105]  No, it's not under control, is what you're saying.
[02:22:17.475 --> 02:22:18.415]  That's correct, Alex.
[02:22:18.556 --> 02:22:23.178]  And to give you the primary case in point is me.
[02:22:24.438 --> 02:22:27.560]  After the anthrax attacks in October 2001, I
[02:22:31.069 --> 02:22:41.892]  I gave three interviews saying this undoubtedly originated out of a United States government warfare laboratory working on anthrax.
[02:22:42.752 --> 02:22:52.715]  I gave that interview first to Fox News in Boston as I was entering the Harvard Divinity School to chair a working group
[02:22:53.355 --> 02:22:53.956]  We're good to go.
[02:23:14.193 --> 02:23:18.857]  Then I gave an interview on this saying the same thing to the BBC.
[02:23:19.457 --> 02:23:32.288]  The whole world heard me, and then the order was given never to interview me again in any mainstream news media source here in the United States or in Europe.
[02:23:32.788 --> 02:23:41.796]  I kid you not, and no one in the mainstream news media has ever interviewed me again on biological warfare programs
[02:23:42.256 --> 02:23:46.741]  For any reason, even though I wrote the statute on the books.
[02:23:47.202 --> 02:23:48.864]  So, you're absolutely correct.
[02:23:49.244 --> 02:23:55.771]  I've been blackballed and blacklisted out of the mainstream news media since early November 2001.
[02:23:55.811 --> 02:23:56.112]  So, sure.
[02:23:59.025 --> 02:24:00.406]  And there's a major backlash.
[02:24:00.446 --> 02:24:03.748]  This Chinese doctor that first reported it was deadly a month ago, he died of it.
[02:24:03.788 --> 02:24:04.669]  He's now a hero.
[02:24:04.689 --> 02:24:08.992]  I mean, the state never is able to cover this up, especially in the digital age.
[02:24:09.472 --> 02:24:14.096]  I don't think that they're going to be able to censor everybody when everybody understands what's happening.
[02:24:15.977 --> 02:24:16.517]  I don't know.
[02:24:16.738 --> 02:24:20.400]  I have been successfully silenced since November of 2001.
[02:24:22.702 --> 02:24:29.225]  Undoubtedly, agencies in the United States government have just ordered the mainstream news, the U.S.
[02:24:29.245 --> 02:24:29.826]  news media.
[02:24:29.926 --> 02:24:33.247]  Well, sure, Operation Mockingbird, they've confirmed that, but that's old corporate media.
[02:24:33.267 --> 02:24:41.111]  You're all over the place in independent media, so I just think in that paradigm you've been silenced, but that's why they're dying, is they don't have real people.
[02:24:42.648 --> 02:24:48.349]  Well, you're correct about that, but all I do, I deal with the media all the time.
[02:24:48.809 --> 02:24:52.330]  They know exactly who I am, and they won't talk to me.
[02:24:52.610 --> 02:25:01.452]  The mainstream news that gets out to tens of millions of people, they're simply not going to let me go on and say what I just told you today.
[02:25:01.892 --> 02:25:02.392]  Well said.
[02:25:02.412 --> 02:25:05.313]  Alright, Sean in New Jersey, you're on the air with Dr. Boyle, go ahead.
[02:25:06.593 --> 02:25:08.593]  Hey, how's it going today, Alex, Dr. Boyle?
[02:25:09.634 --> 02:25:11.634]  I'm worried about my children, I'll be frank with you, go ahead.
[02:25:12.587 --> 02:25:14.950]  I totally understand where you're coming from, brother.
[02:25:14.970 --> 02:25:16.031]  Well, this is real quick.
[02:25:16.411 --> 02:25:25.501]  When you pulled up the map of the bioweapons labs, it struck me because I heard that Ping ran off to an island compound.
[02:25:26.181 --> 02:25:31.387]  And if you hold the map up and see how deserted the west coast is of these biolabs,
[02:25:32.122 --> 02:25:46.694]  Now, this is just a scenario, but couldn't elites be planning to head out there and then whatever population is left over after the apocalypse, like, use them as work, as, like, laborers to try to rebuild their society?
[02:25:47.759 --> 02:25:50.440]  You know, bioweapons spread via airplanes and everything else.
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:59.523]  Speculation is great to think things through, but I think it's just because where the universities are, they want to put them on fault lines so that they're in more stable areas geographically.
[02:25:59.843 --> 02:26:01.064]  Let's ask an expert.
[02:26:01.104 --> 02:26:04.765]  Dr. Boyle, why do you think the Level 4 bioweapons labs are where they are?
[02:26:06.606 --> 02:26:12.908]  Research, development, testing of offensive biological weapons and in areas where
[02:26:13.873 --> 02:26:17.975]  They have easy access, if necessary, to human beings.
[02:26:18.055 --> 02:26:19.835]  Look at the anthrax.
[02:26:19.995 --> 02:26:27.478]  The United States government is fully prepared to wage anthrax warfare all over the world.
[02:26:28.078 --> 02:26:36.281]  If that story broke in USA Today, there were massive shipments of anthrax, weapons-grade anthrax,
[02:26:37.077 --> 02:26:43.243]  Out of Dugway Proving Ground, where they store this stuff, to U.S.
[02:26:43.323 --> 02:26:46.226]  biowarfare labs all over the country.
[02:26:46.266 --> 02:26:47.607]  And tell them how they love anthrax.
[02:26:48.028 --> 02:26:54.194]  It's miniaturized, it lives thousands of years, and they've got silos full of it, enough to kill the whole planet.
[02:26:55.711 --> 02:26:58.432]  And the Pentagon said, well, this is a mistake.
[02:26:58.512 --> 02:27:00.153]  Well, you know, I've dealt with the Pentagon.
[02:27:00.173 --> 02:27:03.815]  They don't make mistakes like this, not with weapons-grade anthrax.
[02:27:04.335 --> 02:27:12.078]  They were stockpiling all these BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs around the United States with weapons-grade anthrax.
[02:27:12.638 --> 02:27:13.299]  To be used.
[02:27:13.599 --> 02:27:14.540]  That's the only reason.
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:15.100]  No, you're right on.
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:15.901]  Big stuff like that.
[02:27:15.941 --> 02:27:17.863]  There's 20 levels of neurotic checking.
[02:27:18.223 --> 02:27:22.747]  Why do you think with Dick Cheney those cruise missiles came up missing 15 years ago?
[02:27:22.787 --> 02:27:23.968]  That's always a big question.
[02:27:24.228 --> 02:27:25.389]  They said that was an accident.
[02:27:25.689 --> 02:27:26.530]  People called it out.
[02:27:26.570 --> 02:27:29.332]  They killed the crew and the people that witnessed it.
[02:27:29.592 --> 02:27:31.134]  What the hell was happening with those cruise missiles?
[02:27:32.182 --> 02:27:46.241]  Well, I believe that after 9-11, 2001, they invoked their secret government, alternative government program, COG, Continuity of Government.
[02:27:46.261 --> 02:27:46.962]  COG.
[02:27:47.523 --> 02:27:49.746]  That, you're right, that was under Cheney.
[02:27:50.407 --> 02:27:57.155]  And so basically we had two chains of military command here in the United States.
[02:27:57.776 --> 02:28:00.559]  One under President Bush Jr.
[02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:02.902]  and the second under Cheney.
[02:28:03.403 --> 02:28:07.408]  So I believe... That's why I started saying Cheney's the president, because he was.
[02:28:08.533 --> 02:28:08.753]  Right.
[02:28:08.973 --> 02:28:15.157]  So I believe that the two chains of command can account for all these incidents.
[02:28:15.558 --> 02:28:20.021]  And that's why one group of military police caught and found the nukes when they were about to be flown out.
[02:28:20.041 --> 02:28:21.762]  So the question is, where were they going?
[02:28:23.018 --> 02:28:27.140]  Right, well, you know, chaining the neocons, I guess we're going to use them.
[02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:30.501]  You know, there were, was it B-52 bombers were sent?
[02:28:31.341 --> 02:28:34.703]  There were nukes sent to Taiwan and things of that nature.
[02:28:35.063 --> 02:28:37.164]  So I believe... So everybody blames the government.
[02:28:37.184 --> 02:28:39.364]  The government's just like humanity, good and evil.
[02:28:40.305 --> 02:28:41.605]  It's a battle within the government.
[02:28:41.625 --> 02:28:43.606]  It's a battle within our own households, everybody.
[02:28:43.986 --> 02:28:45.867]  It really comes down to just good and evil, doesn't it?
[02:28:47.364 --> 02:28:48.744]  I think that's correct.
[02:28:49.024 --> 02:28:50.385]  I think you're right about that, Alex.
[02:28:50.525 --> 02:28:56.586]  It's our moral and religious training that we're dealing with here.
[02:28:57.827 --> 02:29:02.828]  Humanity has literally stopped the Nazis and the Soviets and the globalists.
[02:29:03.308 --> 02:29:07.789]  We've defeated evil, but it's always been barely, and that's why good men and women have to take action now.
[02:29:08.209 --> 02:29:09.369]  I know we're out of 20 seconds.
[02:29:09.610 --> 02:29:10.450]  What's your latest book?
[02:29:10.510 --> 02:29:11.370]  How do people find your books?
[02:29:12.512 --> 02:29:17.896]  Well, I'd just say for this, the most important book is Biowarfare and Terrorism.
[02:29:18.437 --> 02:29:29.846]  It takes the story up to its publication, and then after that, I've given a series of interviews to an investigative reporter.
[02:29:29.906 --> 02:29:31.587]  Hold on, you gotta hold if you want to plug that.
[02:29:32.168 --> 02:29:37.652]  Again, I said this when Dr. Francis Boyle joined us an hour and a half ago live, and here we are, he's about to leave us.
[02:29:39.289 --> 02:29:40.390]  Was Atlantis real?
[02:29:41.290 --> 02:29:44.112]  Plato wrote about a lot of things that turned out they dug up were true.
[02:29:44.912 --> 02:29:46.613]  But we are Atlantis now.
[02:29:47.374 --> 02:29:51.336]  A civilization advanced that gets technology too powerful and they blow themselves up.
[02:29:53.437 --> 02:29:54.178]  Is that real?
[02:29:54.318 --> 02:29:56.079]  Are we reaching that Atlantean moment?
[02:29:56.119 --> 02:30:01.642]  And then just speak to that briefly Dr. Boyle and then finish up with your latest book you were getting into.
[02:30:03.603 --> 02:30:04.164]  Well Alex,
[02:30:05.242 --> 02:30:11.245]  What happened there in Wuhan, and I feel terrible for the Chinese government people.
[02:30:11.566 --> 02:30:15.508]  They live under a communist government, so there's very little they can really do.
[02:30:16.088 --> 02:30:21.171]  This is a wake-up call for those of us here in the United States of America.
[02:30:21.691 --> 02:30:27.375]  That is supposed to be a democracy with a constitution and the rule of law.
[02:30:28.055 --> 02:30:31.197]  And we need to come to grips with this immediately.
[02:30:31.934 --> 02:30:47.337]  We need to convince President Trump to fire his team of swamp creature scientists who are up to the eyeballs in biological warfare work and bring in outside independent experts who have never accepted one penny.
[02:30:47.877 --> 02:30:48.618]  We're good to go.
[02:31:05.897 --> 02:31:15.144]  Before it gets completely out of control and try to, you know, protect the American people, our public health.
[02:31:15.565 --> 02:31:21.309]  You know, we've wasted $120 billion on biological warfare.
[02:31:21.770 --> 02:31:27.674]  That money should have been spent improving the public health and medical treatment of
[02:31:28.915 --> 02:31:34.036]  American people, and not on this biowarfare work.
[02:31:34.516 --> 02:31:48.739]  And every BSL-3, every BSL-4 facility here in the United States should be shut down immediately before we have an accident like what happened in Wuhan.
[02:31:49.179 --> 02:31:51.299]  You know, we have to be very careful here.
[02:31:51.319 --> 02:31:54.000]  You know, there but for the grace of God go I.
[02:31:54.560 --> 02:32:02.764]  When we're looking at what's happening in Wuhan here, I don't want to see it here happen to my American people.
[02:32:03.424 --> 02:32:15.809]  And that is why I've spent the last hour and 40 minutes with you on this program to try to get the message out here to our American people.
[02:32:15.829 --> 02:32:16.369]  No, I understand.
[02:32:16.409 --> 02:32:19.110]  You think it's very, very serious and you're an academic, a smart guy.
[02:32:19.130 --> 02:32:22.512]  I just keep telling you, everybody needs to have their work promoted in the system.
[02:32:24.133 --> 02:32:25.874]  The last book you were plugging as we went to break?
[02:32:27.395 --> 02:32:30.297]  Well, it was just, uh, Biowarfare and Terrorism.
[02:32:30.397 --> 02:32:32.219]  You can get that at Amazon.
[02:32:32.739 --> 02:32:47.890]  And then I sent to your staff a comprehensive interview I gave as of August 2015 to an investigator, a friend of mine, Sherwood Ross, that updates everything until October 15.
[02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:49.671]  And then after that,
[02:32:50.271 --> 02:32:57.414]  You will have to go to Google to get interviews I have given on these matters.
[02:32:57.534 --> 02:33:07.639]  As I said, the mainstream news media will not report anything I have to say, so you're not going to find it in any mainstream news media sources.
[02:33:10.060 --> 02:33:11.141]  Powerful information.
[02:33:11.201 --> 02:33:12.261]  Please join us again.
[02:33:12.301 --> 02:33:13.642]  We really appreciate you, Dr. Boyle.
[02:33:14.619 --> 02:33:24.061]  Well, again, thank you for having me on, Alex, and for taking the time to bring this message to our American people.
[02:33:24.782 --> 02:33:31.063]  I think we still have time to contain this and save our people, and we can.
[02:33:31.103 --> 02:33:33.864]  I give you the best advice I can under the circumstances.
[02:33:34.551 --> 02:33:34.891]  Thank you.
[02:33:34.911 --> 02:33:35.772]  We'll talk again soon.
[02:33:35.813 --> 02:33:36.193]  Be safe.
[02:33:36.233 --> 02:33:36.553]  Thank you.
[02:33:37.074 --> 02:33:37.835]  Up there in Chicago.
[02:33:38.235 --> 02:33:38.596]  Okay.
[02:33:39.297 --> 02:33:41.039]  I want to finish up with five or six calls.
[02:33:41.199 --> 02:33:43.782]  Elaine, Mark, Kevin, and Shara.
[02:33:44.623 --> 02:33:48.748]  And the war room's coming up with Owen Troyer all fresh with the information he's got.
[02:33:52.011 --> 02:33:52.732]  But you heard him.
[02:33:53.692 --> 02:34:00.918]  He's going off stacks of university reports and admissions, and he sent me all these links to U.S.
[02:34:00.938 --> 02:34:05.461]  government admissions of souping up the coronavirus and all of these groups involved.
[02:34:05.482 --> 02:34:06.482]  This is just insane.
[02:34:07.203 --> 02:34:08.784]  And they all do it in the name of safety.
[02:34:10.565 --> 02:34:12.927]  Like, we all have guns in our houses in the name of safety.
[02:34:13.848 --> 02:34:16.770]  But if they're not locked up right or somebody bad gets them, they can cause a problem.
[02:34:16.810 --> 02:34:17.371]  That's okay.
[02:34:19.005 --> 02:34:20.185]  Just a few people get killed.
[02:34:20.825 --> 02:34:21.766]  That's part of being free.
[02:34:21.906 --> 02:34:22.626]  Bad stuff happens.
[02:34:23.186 --> 02:34:26.787]  And overall, the good outweighs the bad that we're free and empowered and it's good.
[02:34:28.287 --> 02:34:33.749]  But would you have antimatter weapons in your house that could blow the whole solar system up just to make sure a robber couldn't do something?
[02:34:33.789 --> 02:34:34.009]  No.
[02:34:34.449 --> 02:34:36.690]  You don't have antimatter weapons in all your houses.
[02:34:36.770 --> 02:34:40.010]  In fact, no government and no group should make it.
[02:34:40.130 --> 02:34:42.331]  And that's the difference between good and evil.
[02:34:43.959 --> 02:34:44.780]  God's God.
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:51.705]  So God wouldn't create an antimatter weapon that would just blow up a bunch of innocent creatures for no reason just because God could.
[02:34:51.725 --> 02:34:53.247]  It's called restraint.
[02:34:55.709 --> 02:34:59.452]  Like, you could go crap in the public pool as an exercise of power.
[02:34:59.892 --> 02:35:00.993]  You're called a mental patient.
[02:35:02.734 --> 02:35:04.896]  Very few people crap in the pool unless they're babies.
[02:35:06.097 --> 02:35:07.738]  And this is baby-like behavior.
[02:35:08.789 --> 02:35:11.152]  And this crapping in the pool will blow the whole planet up.
[02:35:11.772 --> 02:35:22.103]  And so that's where I come down to is there is a arms race in chemical weapons, biological weapons, conventional weapons, psychological weapons, the drugging of the public.
[02:35:23.948 --> 02:35:25.709]  The electromagnetic manipulation.
[02:35:25.789 --> 02:35:29.470]  It's just, let's do it, because if we don't, somebody else will.
[02:35:30.131 --> 02:35:33.872]  And we'll test it and see what it does, and if it's bad, we won't use it.
[02:35:34.353 --> 02:35:41.936]  But we'll be able to recognize it, and then they go with whatever the worst path is, because by the time you figure it out, somebody else has.
[02:35:41.976 --> 02:35:44.117]  Well, now we've got to use it, because they've got it.
[02:35:45.299 --> 02:35:47.381]  And it's just, it's the end of humanity, folks.
[02:35:48.121 --> 02:35:57.529]  We're babies on this planet, developing incredible technologies that have been developed countless times before, and God's been through this, and we're acting like idiots.
[02:35:58.510 --> 02:36:00.371]  We've been given a blueprint, it's called the Bible.
[02:36:00.731 --> 02:36:05.075]  It warns of all this happening in great detail, and says, do not do this.
[02:36:05.575 --> 02:36:10.059]  But it says, you're going to do it, and then this is going to happen, and this is how you get out of it.
[02:36:12.697 --> 02:36:15.579]  Spiritually calling on SOS.
[02:36:16.119 --> 02:36:21.502]  But God wants you to see it all come to pass and make your free will choice before that happens.
[02:36:21.542 --> 02:36:22.663]  That's pretty heavy, isn't it?
[02:36:23.663 --> 02:36:24.844]  He'll say, who are you?
[02:36:25.625 --> 02:36:29.527]  You will do this to us to give us free will, but you wouldn't put up with it.
[02:36:32.869 --> 02:36:34.390]  No, the creator of the universe.
[02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:36.531]  Actually, pull back from this.
[02:36:36.571 --> 02:36:39.212]  It's like, it's not fiction written by some Hebrews.
[02:36:39.312 --> 02:36:41.634]  It's direct divine knowledge, folks.
[02:36:43.727 --> 02:36:45.608]  No, God would say, no, I'll actually do it.
[02:36:46.189 --> 02:36:47.630]  I'll come down there, I'll show you how it's done.
[02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:50.011]  I'll walk a mile in your shoes right now.
[02:36:50.031 --> 02:36:50.932]  You want me to do it?
[02:36:51.312 --> 02:36:51.912]  I'll do it right now.
[02:36:52.573 --> 02:36:56.275]  In fact, I won't just physically take the torture and all of it.
[02:36:57.035 --> 02:37:06.401]  I will take all of the sin on so that I metaphysically then can forgive you and take you on because that's how the universe works.
[02:37:06.481 --> 02:37:07.322]  It's energetic.
[02:37:08.464 --> 02:37:12.605]  And God's got to be that sacrificial lamb that goes between the two.
[02:37:13.825 --> 02:37:18.886]  Because you can't have new free will creatures, given that much power, who aren't going to mess up and do evil stuff.
[02:37:19.506 --> 02:37:24.708]  But they've just got to make the spiritual decision to go with God, and then God will cheat the rest of the way to take us over.
[02:37:25.368 --> 02:37:29.829]  And you know, at this level, God's going to take folks over that are still turning against God.
[02:37:30.129 --> 02:37:33.370]  I'm telling you, I don't want to get into stuff, but I've seen the next levels.
[02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:34.650]  And they're indescribable.
[02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:39.674]  This isn't just like the simplification people hear in all this.
[02:37:40.475 --> 02:37:44.539]  But there's a lot of rebellion going on against the nature of the universe.
[02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:48.522]  And unlimited life, unlimited creation.
[02:37:48.983 --> 02:37:51.345]  And most of the time, people blow themselves up.
[02:37:53.247 --> 02:37:56.950]  But out of that process, God gets the elect, the remnant.
[02:37:57.773 --> 02:37:58.613]  It's what's called the remnant.
[02:37:58.633 --> 02:38:00.434]  You think it's all just a remnant of those that love God.
[02:38:00.874 --> 02:38:05.816]  It's done over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[02:38:05.836 --> 02:38:10.297]  Because you're not going to be given power unless you can handle it.
[02:38:12.178 --> 02:38:15.439]  I remember my life, every time I made the right decision, didn't sell out.
[02:38:17.574 --> 02:38:23.538]  Didn't get intimidated, didn't back down, had doors closed, like clicking a switch.
[02:38:24.318 --> 02:38:24.579]  Boom!
[02:38:24.759 --> 02:38:29.362]  All of a sudden, all these doors open, and my discernment increased, which makes me humble.
[02:38:29.902 --> 02:38:33.144]  And so I've learned, like, wow, it's not the globalists in control.
[02:38:33.404 --> 02:38:37.267]  They're trying to create omnipresent computers they hope can mimic this, because they know it's there.
[02:38:37.487 --> 02:38:44.272]  They're all doing their wicked stuff, because they realize every step they make doesn't make them stronger, makes them weaker.
[02:38:44.972 --> 02:38:47.815]  So they get more violent, more deceptive, more satanic.
[02:38:48.095 --> 02:38:49.777]  Your calls, we come right back in four minutes.
[02:38:49.797 --> 02:38:50.217]  Stay with us.
[02:38:51.699 --> 02:38:57.504]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seen tearing up her copy of President Trump's State of the Union address last night.
[02:39:00.117 --> 02:39:05.559]  Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripping up her copy of the President's State of the Union speech.
[02:39:05.659 --> 02:39:06.879]  Well, he will not be acquitted.
[02:39:06.919 --> 02:39:10.100]  The impeachment trial of President Donald John Trump is officially over.
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:14.922]  The Senate, as anticipated, did vote to acquit President Trump on both articles of impeachment against him.
[02:39:15.082 --> 02:39:16.942]  That's not how a democracy works.
[02:39:17.042 --> 02:39:18.343]  That's not how it works.
[02:39:18.783 --> 02:39:20.583]  That's not how any of this works.
[02:39:20.863 --> 02:39:21.123]  Holy s**t.
[02:39:26.307 --> 02:39:28.569]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[02:39:29.390 --> 02:39:32.592]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[02:39:33.193 --> 02:39:36.556]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[02:39:37.136 --> 02:39:41.120]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[02:39:46.484 --> 02:39:48.206]  You know, I'm not into cuss words.
[02:39:49.647 --> 02:39:53.170]  Because I've got a big... vocabulary.
[02:39:54.574 --> 02:39:57.256]  But Democrats cuss all over broadcast TV and radio.
[02:39:57.296 --> 02:39:58.157]  They never get in trouble.
[02:39:59.037 --> 02:40:08.084]  But if we let one caller slip through with any of the band's seven words or whatever, they call stations, they try to get complaints.
[02:40:08.444 --> 02:40:12.867]  They never get the fines, but that shows their mentality.
[02:40:12.907 --> 02:40:16.250]  So Trump saying BS is noting this is history.
[02:40:18.206 --> 02:40:28.188]  And notice, none of the stations we have, because I've been airing it, you know, with him saying the actual Bravo Sierra, have gotten mad at us because it's not about the BS, it's about leadership.
[02:40:30.768 --> 02:40:34.809]  Because the president says BS, well now it's okay to see BS.
[02:40:35.449 --> 02:40:44.171]  Teaching boys they're really girls, teaching girls that they're boys, teaching people families are bad, teaching people that's what is obscene.
[02:40:47.193 --> 02:40:54.817]  I've got a lot of family, a lot of great people, and I love Southern Baptists, but they'll tell you a cuss word is worse than aborting a baby.
[02:40:55.497 --> 02:41:02.081]  I mean, they won't say that, but they get more upset about a cuss word or drinking some wine than they will about aborting a baby.
[02:41:03.822 --> 02:41:08.004]  I've got a lot of family who are Southern Baptists, and it's a holiness they have about them.
[02:41:08.084 --> 02:41:09.045]  And I like Trump.
[02:41:09.425 --> 02:41:13.007]  He's actually backing abortion down, starting to shut it down.
[02:41:14.155 --> 02:41:16.736]  But he doesn't get up there and tell you how much he loves Jesus, see?
[02:41:17.056 --> 02:41:19.297]  Because the truth is in the action.
[02:41:20.178 --> 02:41:21.018]  And that's what I like.
[02:41:23.039 --> 02:41:40.167]  You know, the truth is, the Bible doesn't say, using old English, before the Norman took over almost a thousand years ago, before the Vikings took over England, they came in and they banned the entire language of the Saxon.
[02:41:41.817 --> 02:41:48.142]  But it was only the cuss words that continued on the classic things people would say.
[02:41:49.143 --> 02:41:50.824]  Like, bullshit.
[02:41:51.345 --> 02:41:56.549]  They found 2,000-year-old plaques that say something is BS.
[02:41:57.009 --> 02:42:01.773]  And what they, what the Anglo-Saxon would call something, for whatever weird reason they had, BS.
[02:42:07.238 --> 02:42:08.739]  And of course, that was just the word.
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:11.101]  There were hundreds of words banned.
[02:42:12.085 --> 02:42:15.966]  And Trump's basically, metaphysically saying, you don't ban the words anymore.
[02:42:16.366 --> 02:42:17.247]  We're going to use them.
[02:42:17.267 --> 02:42:18.907]  It's not the words that are bad.
[02:42:19.367 --> 02:42:20.448]  It's the bad people.
[02:42:23.628 --> 02:42:26.029]  So you could call it the BS revolution.
[02:42:27.029 --> 02:42:35.552]  Because it's BS to say the left can engage the most satanic garbage, human animal clones, mass killing of already born babies.
[02:42:35.932 --> 02:42:36.892]  And it's like, oh, that's no big deal.
[02:42:37.052 --> 02:42:37.793]  Did you hear Trump?
[02:42:37.833 --> 02:42:38.573]  He said BS.
[02:42:40.879 --> 02:42:45.521]  But notice as soon as he said it, no stations complained, no TV, no satellite.
[02:42:45.541 --> 02:42:47.301]  We let one caller go through, they freak out.
[02:42:47.321 --> 02:42:49.682]  And I get it, because the left's there calling and filing complaints.
[02:42:50.002 --> 02:42:51.303]  But no one's going to enforce it!
[02:42:52.763 --> 02:42:54.084]  I'll leave it at that, let's just say.
[02:42:54.104 --> 02:42:55.644]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:42:57.385 --> 02:43:02.427]  But it just shows the intimidation, where conservatives are so scared they won't say SH-T.
[02:43:03.707 --> 02:43:03.987]  Shit.
[02:43:05.168 --> 02:43:05.428]  But!
[02:43:06.445 --> 02:43:13.610]  The left can teach convicted pedophiles to come in and have five-year-olds sit on their lap without parents even knowing, in many cases, like Colorado.
[02:43:16.112 --> 02:43:17.994]  Let a pedophile have your kids sit on their lap.
[02:43:18.014 --> 02:43:18.634]  That's okay.
[02:43:18.955 --> 02:43:22.677]  Just don't say the Anglo-Saxon word for feces.
[02:43:23.918 --> 02:43:27.101]  Because when you outlaw people's culture, you outlaw their words.
[02:43:34.192 --> 02:43:35.893]  You know, I like all those Anglo-Saxon words.
[02:43:36.534 --> 02:43:39.756]  Tony Montana likes one of those with an F. He uses it a lot.
[02:43:39.776 --> 02:43:40.737]  It sounds good, doesn't it?
[02:43:40.937 --> 02:43:41.657]  It's a good word.
[02:43:42.648 --> 02:43:43.689]  Actually describes it, too.
[02:43:43.709 --> 02:43:45.150]  It's got a lot of different meanings.
[02:43:45.490 --> 02:43:49.733]  Like, you got, or I'm gonna, or that was a great... I mean, it's got a lot of meanings.
[02:43:49.813 --> 02:43:50.594]  It's a nice word.
[02:43:50.974 --> 02:43:51.935]  Why are we so scared of it?
[02:43:52.055 --> 02:43:53.416]  Oh, because we're all good.
[02:43:53.496 --> 02:43:57.619]  We're all... But we didn't do anything about 50 million, 60 million dead babies.
[02:43:57.899 --> 02:43:59.680]  We didn't do anything about all this other stuff.
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:03.383]  We just sat around and felt good and went to church because we were so good all day.
[02:44:03.623 --> 02:44:06.245]  What a load of bullshit!
[02:44:06.625 --> 02:44:07.766]  It's bullshit!
[02:44:10.011 --> 02:44:14.974]  The pedophiles taking over is the enemy, not the president using old English.
[02:44:14.994 --> 02:44:22.219]  A thousand years old, not spoken by any Norman nobility and the elites that captured England.
[02:44:25.502 --> 02:44:28.724]  That is the most Anglo-Saxon, we Scottish, but he even gets it more.
[02:44:29.164 --> 02:44:31.426]  That is the sexiest thing I've seen in a while.
[02:44:32.503 --> 02:44:33.023]  Politically.
[02:44:33.143 --> 02:44:39.607]  I mean, that's just like, you want rebel, you want outlaw, because it's one thing if a leftist says it, no one listens.
[02:44:40.187 --> 02:44:53.574]  But it's the president saying it in his exoneration, in the main West Wing dining, you know, in the main broadcast area, saying, this is BS, and then using a banned word to the system saying, we see through you.
[02:44:54.114 --> 02:44:54.815]  I got to move quick.
[02:44:55.295 --> 02:44:56.436]  Let's go to Mark in Colorado.
[02:44:56.456 --> 02:44:56.936]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:44:56.956 --> 02:44:57.476]  Thanks for holding.
[02:44:58.777 --> 02:44:59.717]  Hey, hello, Alex.
[02:45:00.077 --> 02:45:00.938]  It's good to talk to you.
[02:45:01.816 --> 02:45:03.038]  Um, are you there?
[02:45:03.318 --> 02:45:04.319]  Yes sir, thanks for calling.
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:14.109]  Yeah, um, I have a couple questions I wanted to answer, especially I addressed them to the country of Canada, and if there is an honest government on the face of the earth, which I doubt.
[02:45:15.090 --> 02:45:19.154]  Um, you know who the biologist was that stole from the lab.
[02:45:19.495 --> 02:45:21.737]  You know what she stole from the lab.
[02:45:22.258 --> 02:45:24.340]  You know when she stole it from the lab.
[02:45:25.069 --> 02:45:26.690]  You know how she stole it from the lab?
[02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:28.110]  Obviously, everything's on film.
[02:45:28.190 --> 02:45:31.471]  So why is she not hanging up by her toes till she tells us who did it?
[02:45:31.971 --> 02:45:34.152]  Well, they know the whys.
[02:45:34.272 --> 02:45:38.854]  You know, I smelled espionage from the second I heard that report, which was quite a while ago.
[02:45:39.454 --> 02:45:40.975]  And, you know, think of this.
[02:45:41.575 --> 02:45:50.878]  If this Chinese scientist was allowed to go back to Wuhan and they leaked this out, certainly the Chinese president couldn't say, well, we stole it from Canada.
[02:45:51.298 --> 02:45:53.219]  They'd hang him by his thumbs.
[02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:57.863]  So, you know, I just smell so much intrigue in this whole event.
[02:45:57.943 --> 02:45:58.864]  Oh, no, I agree with you.
[02:45:59.024 --> 02:46:00.705]  I think we know the virus is deadly.
[02:46:00.765 --> 02:46:01.386]  It's man-made.
[02:46:01.786 --> 02:46:02.867]  The question is, who did it?
[02:46:02.927 --> 02:46:03.528]  Deep State?
[02:46:04.028 --> 02:46:04.789]  The Chi-Coms?
[02:46:04.809 --> 02:46:05.049]  The U.S.
[02:46:05.089 --> 02:46:05.429]  government?
[02:46:05.489 --> 02:46:07.791]  I mean, I think it's all open to speculation because we don't know.
[02:46:08.031 --> 02:46:09.212]  But they don't want us to speculate.
[02:46:09.412 --> 02:46:13.035]  We're supposed to sit there and go, oh, what are you telling us?
[02:46:13.075 --> 02:46:15.037]  We're going to, you know, we're the vanguard.
[02:46:15.157 --> 02:46:18.139]  Most of what we said turned out to be true because we're looking at real facts.
[02:46:18.179 --> 02:46:19.200]  And I'm proud of the audience.
[02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:22.743]  I'm proud of the guests because, you know, it's been the audience that's given us a lot of intel.
[02:46:23.598 --> 02:46:23.858]  Yeah.
[02:46:24.118 --> 02:46:26.320]  Canada can answer these questions now.
[02:46:26.380 --> 02:46:28.061]  They can call you up in a few minutes, you know.
[02:46:28.902 --> 02:46:35.947]  I mean, we would have more to deduce from and we wouldn't be speculating.
[02:46:36.307 --> 02:46:37.608]  And now the damage is done.
[02:46:38.128 --> 02:46:43.352]  And now, like Dr. Mike Adams said, this thing is out there.
[02:46:43.893 --> 02:46:46.795]  So, you know, other nefarious people can do this.
[02:46:46.875 --> 02:46:52.539]  I'm just so sick and tired of... You know, I'm your worst critic at the same time I agree with so much of what you do.
[02:46:55.045 --> 02:46:57.428]  So I just want to thank you for talking to me.
[02:46:58.008 --> 02:46:58.989]  Mark, I appreciate you.
[02:46:59.029 --> 02:47:00.130]  Listen, I'm the man in the arena.
[02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:02.793]  And now you all see through rose-colored darklies.
[02:47:03.354 --> 02:47:07.037]  We're all distorted by our own preconceptions, but I mean well.
[02:47:07.878 --> 02:47:08.879]  And I appreciate you.
[02:47:08.899 --> 02:47:10.541]  And I'm my own worst critic as well, so thank you.
[02:47:11.582 --> 02:47:11.903]  Kevin?
[02:47:13.439 --> 02:47:15.781]  And Sarah and Elaine, I respect you.
[02:47:15.881 --> 02:47:16.762]  I appreciate you.
[02:47:16.922 --> 02:47:17.963]  I didn't have time to get to you.
[02:47:17.984 --> 02:47:18.404]  We took longer.
[02:47:18.424 --> 02:47:19.125]  We're over 30 calls.
[02:47:19.365 --> 02:47:25.231]  Owen Schroer promises that right when the war room starts in three minutes, four minutes, he's going to write your calls first.
[02:47:25.611 --> 02:47:26.272]  So please stay there.
[02:47:26.292 --> 02:47:27.393]  They have open phones as well.
[02:47:27.793 --> 02:47:30.315]  Band.video, InfoWars.com, Ford slash show.
[02:47:30.335 --> 02:47:33.659]  It's the easiest place to find the live feeds if you're not listening on radio or TV.
[02:47:35.888 --> 02:47:38.890]  Because it's just, you know, the three feeds of David Knight, myself, and Owen there.
[02:47:39.431 --> 02:47:42.053]  InfoWars.com forward slash show, as I said.
[02:47:42.413 --> 02:47:46.316]  Band.video, you go up to the left-hand side, click the links, find whoever shows on.
[02:47:46.336 --> 02:47:47.397]  It's a live feed right there.
[02:47:47.818 --> 02:47:50.160]  But just spreading it is so important.
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:54.683]  And then again, fighting the info war while at the same time preparing yourself and your family is a 360 win.
[02:47:54.703 --> 02:47:54.863]  We have
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:09.070]  Our main 16 ounce super silver, nano silver, that's been documented by the Pentagon to take out SARS family of viruses, which is the same as this one, it is sold out.
[02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:11.392]  We have the one ounce about to sell out, the three ounce still available.
[02:48:11.412 --> 02:48:13.194]  It'll be sold out at current rates in about a week and a half.
[02:48:13.814 --> 02:48:16.137]  And we have high quality storable foods available.
[02:48:17.258 --> 02:48:20.441]  It's now 10 to 14 days because they've got to package it.
[02:48:21.325 --> 02:48:30.032]  They've got the food, but it's 10 to 14 days and I talked to him two days ago and they said yeah, and then in another week or so we may have to say...
[02:48:31.621 --> 02:48:35.243]  Two weeks out to three weeks, and then we may have to come to a point where we have to stop orders.
[02:48:36.083 --> 02:48:45.607]  And they don't even want to hear that, folks, because they're really worried it is as bad as we think, and they've refused to sell to governments and corporations that were buying up weeks ago.
[02:48:46.228 --> 02:48:48.729]  We have the best, high-quality, affordable food for the price you're going to pay.
[02:48:48.769 --> 02:48:50.890]  It's very good at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.690]  Drop ship.
[02:48:51.890 --> 02:48:53.731]  You know, as the orders come in, they're in our back end.
[02:48:53.751 --> 02:48:54.471]  They take the orders.
[02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:55.812]  We've been partnering with them over 10 years.
[02:48:56.372 --> 02:48:58.994]  MyPatriotSupply and then your purchase funds the Infowar.
[02:48:59.455 --> 02:49:00.836]  And it's just time to get prepared.
[02:49:00.856 --> 02:49:03.097]  They have the Alexa Pure System at InfowarStore.com.
[02:49:03.478 --> 02:49:05.379]  One of the highest rated gravity-fed filters out there.
[02:49:05.419 --> 02:49:06.180]  There's several others.
[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:07.100]  We sell those as well.
[02:49:07.861 --> 02:49:10.203]  It's like, hell, you got... I don't want just one distributor.
[02:49:10.883 --> 02:49:12.885]  Just a lot of times you only find one that's that good.
[02:49:12.925 --> 02:49:15.207]  That's why MyPatriot is the biggest officially now.
[02:49:15.747 --> 02:49:18.249]  Is because they get the food there and it's quality and people like it.
[02:49:18.549 --> 02:49:20.751]  Even our critics advice, like, got the food to make fun of me.
[02:49:20.771 --> 02:49:21.611]  Well, this is pretty good.
[02:49:21.631 --> 02:49:24.754]  Yeah, it's like... But then they attack the other stuff and lied about it.
[02:49:25.313 --> 02:49:28.038]  All right, well, coming up, the War Room straight ahead.
[02:49:28.058 --> 02:49:29.200]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:45.025]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:49:45.566 --> 02:49:48.811]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:49:49.051 --> 02:49:51.735]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:49:52.336 --> 02:49:55.200]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:49:55.881 --> 02:49:57.543]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:49:58.104 --> 02:49:59.564]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:50:00.205 --> 02:50:05.286]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:50:05.666 --> 02:50:13.608]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:50:14.128 --> 02:50:20.510]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:50:20.850 --> 02:50:23.651]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:50:33.741 --> 02:50:49.189]  Something big's about to happen, and I'm not sure it's this virus, but we need to have our bases covered with the virus.
[02:50:50.328 --> 02:50:55.829]  And, you know, I said I would talk about this because this is an important decision for all you out there to think about and decide what you're going to do.
[02:50:55.949 --> 02:50:57.089]  This is in Congress.
[02:50:57.249 --> 02:50:58.930]  This is 13 years ago.
[02:50:59.130 --> 02:51:00.070]  And this is the company.
[02:51:00.170 --> 02:51:04.631]  And when I got this information four or five days ago, I said, listen, are you sure you want me to do this?
[02:51:04.831 --> 02:51:07.111]  Because you've got Department of Defense contracts.
[02:51:07.131 --> 02:51:07.891]  You've got a lot of others.
[02:51:08.051 --> 02:51:08.752]  They might mess with you.
[02:51:08.772 --> 02:51:09.252]  I'm like, no, no.
[02:51:09.352 --> 02:51:10.212]  You know, we're the owners.
[02:51:10.232 --> 02:51:11.252]  We like what you're doing.
[02:51:11.272 --> 02:51:12.152]  We've got a partnership with you.
[02:51:12.212 --> 02:51:15.393]  We want people to know how important this is of the Department of Defense.
[02:51:16.113 --> 02:51:21.659]  And congressional reports say that this product, NanoSilver, has been found to knock out SARS.
[02:51:22.139 --> 02:51:23.521]  Well, no crap, Sherlock.
[02:51:23.541 --> 02:51:24.382]  Of course it does.
[02:51:24.562 --> 02:51:25.823]  Viruses, bacteria, you name it.
[02:51:25.943 --> 02:51:29.007]  Nobody's selling 16 ounces of NanoSilver that's patented.
[02:51:29.047 --> 02:51:30.368]  This is the top company in the U.S.
[02:51:30.388 --> 02:51:31.489]  that we're... Not even a private label.
[02:51:31.509 --> 02:51:32.751]  This is something they developed with my dad.
[02:51:32.811 --> 02:51:33.471]  The Immune Gargle.
[02:51:33.551 --> 02:51:34.072]  But here's the deal.
[02:51:34.212 --> 02:51:39.194]  Department of the Army Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command, Tampa Point Boulevard.
[02:51:39.334 --> 02:51:42.995]  And it goes into Andrew C. von Edenbaugh, Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration.
[02:51:43.135 --> 02:51:51.518]  And they go on to say that with antibiotic resistance and all the rest of it, we have found that this particular type of nanosilver is effective against SARS and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[02:51:51.638 --> 02:51:52.738]  Then it goes on here.
[02:51:52.898 --> 02:51:55.559]  The Texas A&M System Health Science Center.
[02:51:55.719 --> 02:51:58.740]  And it says confidential because they don't want this type of stuff out for life.
[02:51:58.780 --> 02:51:59.080]  I don't know.
[02:52:23.388 --> 02:52:24.729]  It's the grace of God that stuff like this happens.
[02:52:24.749 --> 02:52:26.089]  This is the top company, folks.
[02:52:49.918 --> 02:52:51.099]  And they're like, no, just say who we are.
[02:52:51.119 --> 02:52:54.121]  Robert Keith Moeller, CEO, American Biotech Labs, LLC.
[02:52:54.141 --> 02:52:54.762]  That's the big one.
[02:52:54.782 --> 02:52:58.165]  They're the only ones that have approved, over-the-counter, super silver womb gel.
[02:52:58.205 --> 02:52:59.405]  Do not take this internally.
[02:52:59.425 --> 02:53:05.831]  This is super, well, let's just say what it is, poisonous to bacteria and viruses, which means it ain't too good for you, but it's better than dying, right?
[02:53:06.351 --> 02:53:07.952]  So this goes on the hands and things.
[02:53:07.972 --> 02:53:08.833]  It's a protective shield.
[02:53:08.853 --> 02:53:11.235]  If you get cut or something, or your micro scratches, it seals it in.
[02:53:11.335 --> 02:53:14.257]  But all the other products, they're all discounted right now during this crisis.
[02:53:14.357 --> 02:53:14.798]  Infoworks.com.
[02:53:56.024 --> 02:54:01.508]  I didn't just start selling storable food to the audience last month or six months ago or a year ago.
[02:54:02.489 --> 02:54:06.572]  I've been selling storable food to people that believe they need to get it.
[02:54:07.782 --> 02:54:09.904]  I've been doing that for 20 plus years.
[02:54:10.144 --> 02:54:13.126]  Because it made sense to me to have insurance you can eat during any crisis.
[02:54:13.286 --> 02:54:15.368]  And we hope Trump and America wins.
[02:54:15.428 --> 02:54:17.069]  We hope the globalists get defeated.
[02:54:17.170 --> 02:54:24.615]  But in a war like this, there isn't any arming that wins a war, politically or militarily, that doesn't have food backing it up.
[02:54:24.736 --> 02:54:26.377]  And so that's what we're talking about here.
[02:54:27.878 --> 02:54:30.000]  He went into Russia, he ran out of food, he failed.
[02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:32.562]  Hitler went into Russia, he ran out of food, he failed.
[02:54:32.702 --> 02:54:34.743]  So, you know, Adam Schiff wants us to defeat the Russians.
[02:54:34.763 --> 02:54:35.804]  We need lots of food to do that.
[02:54:35.864 --> 02:54:37.505]  No, we need to defeat the Adam Schiffs of the world.
[02:54:37.585 --> 02:54:41.368]  Because if you don't have food, they control you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:41.448 --> 02:54:43.790]  So, I believed in storable food 20-something years ago.
[02:54:43.930 --> 02:54:44.551]  Got it myself.
[02:54:44.711 --> 02:54:45.892]  It's insurance you can always eat.
[02:54:46.032 --> 02:54:52.098]  But then I noticed that even though they were big, reputable companies, during a big spike they'd make people wait months to get their food and they'd play games.
[02:54:52.258 --> 02:54:58.043]  Well, going back more than 11 years ago, they've been around 12 years, my Patriot Supply came along and promised to be different.
[02:54:58.404 --> 02:55:03.608]  And I slowly worked with them for a couple years to test them out, and now, 10, 11 years later, they're the best.
[02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:05.970]  And again, it's like everything that's the best.
[02:55:06.531 --> 02:55:10.894]  You could have a nexus point, like a graph, like what's the lowest price versus what's the best quality.
[02:55:11.255 --> 02:55:15.178]  There's some stuff that I pointed out that costs way more, 3, 4, 5, 6 times more.
[02:55:15.458 --> 02:55:16.179]  It's like gourmet.
[02:55:16.199 --> 02:55:17.280]  It's ridiculous how good it is.
[02:55:17.620 --> 02:55:18.361]  But it costs way more.
[02:55:19.001 --> 02:55:20.702]  But on a nexus point, this is right in the middle.
[02:55:21.543 --> 02:55:26.244]  Super low cost, the lowest you're gonna find for any decent food, and it's really good, high quality stuff.
[02:55:26.264 --> 02:55:27.304]  Some stuff's like gourmet.
[02:55:27.344 --> 02:55:28.885]  It's like, damn, I eat this every day.
[02:55:28.905 --> 02:55:29.925]  Other stuff's like, yeah, it's pretty good.
[02:55:30.365 --> 02:55:36.746]  The point is, it's really good, and it's not a scam, and they're people that are smart and want a long-term relationship.
[02:55:36.806 --> 02:55:38.207]  You buy it at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:55:38.267 --> 02:55:39.707]  They're in the back end of our computers.
[02:55:39.867 --> 02:55:40.967]  It's my patron supply.
[02:55:41.047 --> 02:55:45.088]  We just get some of the money to fund our operation when you buy it there, InfoWare Store, and they ship it out to you.
[02:55:45.148 --> 02:55:47.130]  They've got food for another 12 days or so.
[02:55:47.170 --> 02:55:47.911]  They're honest about that.
[02:55:48.011 --> 02:55:50.273]  What they don't have is the people to pack it.
[02:55:50.373 --> 02:55:57.620]  So they're going 24 hours a day at their three factories in the United States, one in Utah, the other two big ones, and that's what's happening.
[02:55:57.681 --> 02:55:59.943]  No, they're there, and they're taking your orders.
[02:55:59.983 --> 02:56:05.288]  The other big companies just instantly, when institutions called, big corporations, governments called, they sold out.
[02:56:05.328 --> 02:56:06.770]  The Chi-Coms bought up all the mass.
[02:56:06.790 --> 02:56:07.971]  They've tried to buy up all the food they can.
[02:56:08.131 --> 02:56:08.271]  Great!
[02:56:08.351 --> 02:56:09.352]  The Chinese need food.
[02:56:09.492 --> 02:56:09.752]  I get it.
[02:56:09.773 --> 02:56:10.353]  They're shipping over there.
[02:56:10.393 --> 02:56:10.813]  That's great.
[02:56:10.974 --> 02:56:17.880]  We are selling food to the American people, and that's the message and the mission of Tim Redhawk, the founder and their CEO, that's coming on with us next second.
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:20.462]  But this is something that is the trifecta.
[02:56:20.562 --> 02:56:22.244]  It's great food you and your family need.
[02:56:22.444 --> 02:56:29.050]  It funds the information war, and at the same time, it gives you the confidence to know that you've taken care of yourself and your family.
[02:56:29.070 --> 02:56:30.051]  So, it's that simple.
[02:56:30.131 --> 02:56:31.533]  It's called Ready Hour.
[02:56:32.213 --> 02:56:35.838]  Now, we used to call it InfoWars Select because I could get around the rules they had at their company.
[02:56:36.218 --> 02:56:39.082]  They were even lower in the prices to dominate the market.
[02:56:39.142 --> 02:56:40.163]  I am their biggest distributor.
[02:56:40.363 --> 02:56:41.525]  That's how we fund this operation.
[02:56:43.007 --> 02:56:44.989]  But they came to me and they said, that's boosting the price.
[02:56:45.009 --> 02:56:45.970]  You'd have to private label it.
[02:56:47.571 --> 02:56:48.372]  Not the private labeling.
[02:56:48.392 --> 02:56:49.212]  Just call it what we call it.
[02:56:49.472 --> 02:56:49.873]  Ready Hour.
[02:56:49.973 --> 02:56:50.313]  So we do.
[02:56:50.673 --> 02:56:52.094]  Just order it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:52.654 --> 02:56:53.795]  It funds our whole operation.
[02:56:54.476 --> 02:56:55.656]  And it really is excellent.
[02:56:55.716 --> 02:56:56.437]  It's super high quality.
[02:56:56.457 --> 02:56:59.119]  They have special meals for special diets and so much more.
[02:56:59.159 --> 02:56:59.899]  They have four weeks.
[02:56:59.919 --> 02:57:00.599]  They have three months.
[02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:01.420]  They have four months.
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:02.000]  They have six months.
[02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:02.561]  They have years.
[02:57:03.041 --> 02:57:08.665]  This is something everyone should do to invest in their future and to begin the road towards preparedness.
[02:57:08.925 --> 02:57:09.966]  Because the Chinese say,
[02:57:10.686 --> 02:57:13.429]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:57:13.770 --> 02:57:18.115]  Well, getting storable food and firearms is more than the single step.
[02:57:21.218 --> 02:57:23.521]  InfoWars.
[02:57:25.123 --> 02:57:27.846]  The most banned network in the world.
