[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.131]  When is the last time a government said, oh, we just need to spy on your emails for a little while.
[00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:06.472]  We just need to attack your phone for a little while.
[00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:08.853]  Oh, we just need to censor your speech for a little while.
[00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:11.715]  Oh, we just need to make sure you don't say hateful things for a little while.
[00:00:11.975 --> 00:00:13.436]  But in the future, we're going to go back.
[00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:13.996]  Never!
[00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:16.297]  Every single thing they introduce, they keep forever.
[00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:22.920]  And the reason they're saying we may have to go back at any point is so they can press a button at any point in the future, get everyone else locked inside their house again.
[00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:27.703]  You have to understand the people who are in charge of the world, the elites, are beyond money.
[00:00:28.423 --> 00:00:29.444]  They don't care about money.
[00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:30.564]  They print money on demand.
[00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:31.485]  Money doesn't matter to them.
[00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:35.586]  They have no problem destroying an economy and bankrupting millions and millions of people.
[00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:36.627]  It doesn't bother them.
[00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.268]  They're ultra-trillionaires.
[00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:38.948]  They own banks.
[00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:40.469]  They own the food and the air and the water.
[00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:41.809]  They don't care about any of this.
[00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.331]  The one thing they want more of isn't money, it's power.
[00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:51.054]  And this has given them the perfect excuse to tell everyone to stay in their house, otherwise face severe consequence.
[00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:54.035]  This is a power grab and they're never going to give the power back.
[00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:54.775]  Ever.
[00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:55.896]  It's insanity.
[00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:58.477]  This will be the greatest economic hit.
[00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:00.078]  But you don't have a choice.
[00:01:00.138 --> 00:01:01.458]  People act like you have a choice.
[00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:07.561]  People don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected.
[00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:12.583]  You know, it's not the government who's saying, OK, just ignore this disease.
[00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:16.085]  You know, people are deeply affected.
[00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:26.421]  By seeing these deaths, by knowing they could be part of the transmission chain, and old people, their parents, their grandparents could be affected by this.
[00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:33.744]  And so you don't get to say, ignore what's going on here.
[00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:41.530]  There will be the ability, particularly in rich countries, to open up if things are done well over the next few months.
[00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:52.475]  But for the world at large, normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:55.957]  He is the Earth's first planetary dictator.
[00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:05.021]  He's all over TV, he's all over everything, leading and guiding and directing us and saying, sorry, there is no choice.
[00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:06.602]  It's never coming back.
[00:02:07.543 --> 00:02:17.950]  First it was two weeks, then it was two months, and now he said, oh, for some of the richer countries, maybe you'll have a little bit of time before we lock you back down.
[00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.571]  I just played this.
[00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:23.482]  For the rest of the world, it's not coming back.
[00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:39.172]  And hundreds of millions will starve to death, and it'll just be a little footnote, yeah, but people in America know not to go out and do things anymore, and go out and buy things, and as the world economy collapses, the third world dependent on us, they're dead.
[00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:44.435]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:56.754]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide, I am your host Alex Jones, and it is Wednesday, May 6th, the year is 2020.
[00:02:56.874 --> 00:03:10.363]  I'm going to be hosting the first hour here today, and then Paul Watson's going to host a couple hours, and then we have hosting in the fourth hour, John Rappaport, always informative.
[00:03:11.986 --> 00:03:14.387]  I may pop back in some with him in the fourth hour.
[00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:19.889]  I'm gonna be here working on some very big stories and some very big developments that are so important.
[00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.770]  I have to go off air to deal with them.
[00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.193]  We don't normally have things like that happen maybe a couple times a year, but there's definitely some good things happening.
[00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:31.234]  There's also a lot of bad things happening.
[00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.514]  Of course, it was the best of times.
[00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:33.875]  It was the worst of times.
[00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.642]  I'm going to do my best in this hour just to lay out the big themes of where we are as a planet.
[00:03:41.183 --> 00:03:53.793]  And you'll notice if you're a regular listener or a longtime listener particularly, that you're turning on the news every day now and it's everything we told you 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, a year ago.
[00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:57.135]  The United States is at war with Communist China.
[00:03:58.436 --> 00:04:02.620]  I told you two weeks ago, Trump is moving everyone towards understanding that.
[00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.251]  And now indeed you hear Trump talking about we're in a type of war with China.
[00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:17.714]  That undeclared war been going on for a long time with Communist China and its fifth column inside the United States.
[00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:23.756]  The globalists developed China to help bring down the United States and that's just the facts.
[00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:28.278]  That's what the CFR and the Club of Rome and Davos and all of them say.
[00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:29.298]  They're arrogant.
[00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:36.927]  The head of Goldman Sachs, when Trump first got in and said, we're going to rebuild America, he laughed and said, no, you'll never do that.
[00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:37.847]  America's over.
[00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:41.548]  Those are public statements.
[00:04:42.128 --> 00:04:46.709]  These are horrible, horrible, horrible people.
[00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:55.651]  And that's why you have the Washington Post with headlines like, Xi Jinping, the dictator of China, must destroy Trump.
[00:04:57.691 --> 00:04:58.531]  To save America.
[00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:12.778]  And the average leftist that I know, my oldest producer, been here 18 years, his sister will not talk to him in Minnesota and says, I love Xi Jinping, crush Trump.
[00:05:13.858 --> 00:05:17.880]  You understand, this is mainline Democrat thought processing.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.223]  So I get for the average Christian, conservative, nationalist, patriot, common sense guy, gal, just goes to work, black, white, old, young.
[00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.416]  They're like, oh yeah Alex, the Communist Chinese own Hollywood, they're taking over with the elites and Harvard.
[00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:34.940]  Yeah, Harvard is the nest of Communist Chinese spies.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.608]  I mean, if Harvard disappeared, and I'm not calling for that, but if the people that run Harvard were dropped into a black hole,
[00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:48.116]  Our problems would be 80% fixed, okay, because they run China.
[00:05:48.596 --> 00:06:02.945]  That's why Xi Jinping's daughter, no one's supposed to know this, but I've confirmed this with folks in, let's just say, certain areas, goes to school and lives at Harvard under a pseudonym, under an alias.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.362]  It isn't China that runs all this, but China's the big demonic robot.
[00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:13.722]  China's the big automaton.
[00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:21.445]  And then you've got the little bubble on the top with the little Harvard mafia up there running the levers of this giant robot that's attacking us.
[00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:29.707]  And they're up there laughing and squealing and setting up one-sided trade deals where we've been totally screwed, and the surrender's over.
[00:06:30.127 --> 00:06:32.408]  And by the way, I got news for the leftists in the New World Order.
[00:06:33.834 --> 00:06:38.558]  You might be able to take me out, you might be able to take Trump out, but it's the beginning of the end here.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:47.807]  Because people now know, and there's been a huge awakening to what's happening, and you'll never put the genie back in the bottle.
[00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:59.017]  I'm going to talk about cause and effect, and why the globalists have really screwed the pooch, jumped the shark, blown their feet off, stuck their ding-dong in the light socket.
[00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:03.100]  Cut their own nose off to spite their face.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.943]  There's a lot of different sayings, but there's nothing like actually watching the real thing happen.
[00:07:07.003 --> 00:07:09.005]  So, best of times, worst of times.
[00:07:09.025 --> 00:07:10.526]  It's a tale of two cities.
[00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:11.807]  Stay with us.
[00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:12.928]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:14.569]  And remember, you are the resistance.
[00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:15.510]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.630]  What does Paul Revere do?
[00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:18.852]  It's Wednesday, May 6th.
[00:07:18.912 --> 00:07:19.973]  The year is 2020.
[00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:28.720]  We are now 180 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[00:07:29.605 --> 00:07:30.807]  This is not a simulation.
[00:07:31.548 --> 00:07:35.613]  This is real life on this planet, in deep space, in the third dimension.
[00:07:36.073 --> 00:07:36.894]  God is real.
[00:07:37.635 --> 00:07:38.496]  Satan is real.
[00:07:39.017 --> 00:07:40.419]  And you and I are real.
[00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:44.284]  This is what it is to be conscious, sentient beings.
[00:07:45.645 --> 00:07:47.566]  What a time to be here.
[00:07:48.227 --> 00:08:00.094]  What a time to have millions of amazing humans of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and have a connection to God standing and promoting a pro-human future against the technocracy.
[00:08:00.835 --> 00:08:01.996]  The battle is joined.
[00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:03.336]  The gloves are off.
[00:08:03.797 --> 00:08:04.817]  The games are over.
[00:08:05.258 --> 00:08:09.500]  And people now know InfoWars was dead on.
[00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:11.842]  Thanks to
[00:08:14.329 --> 00:08:40.201]  Providence, thanks to the fact that our ancestors knew what was coming and what was going on and had so much foresight into the future that they could envision what was coming and warn us so that we would be in a position
[00:08:43.442 --> 00:08:48.003]  To stand against this dehumanizing force when the final battle came.
[00:09:14.522 --> 00:09:21.925]  More than 50 major universities have already publicly cut off the communist Chinese government funding that's run officially by the Chinese army.
[00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:25.846]  UT was getting hundreds of millions a year from the Chinese army.
[00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:35.110]  The Chinese army was in control of who could be hired to work at UT and they would run the office of personnel hack that Obama gave the Chi-Coms.
[00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.912]  So anybody that was a conservative or a patriot or been in the military who wasn't a communist couldn't get a job.
[00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:42.513]  I mean, that's the level of the takeover.
[00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:52.379]  And the Chi-Coms have infiltrated every other facet of our nation, but particularly universities and the media, where money is king.
[00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:58.401]  But that is all being cut off, and they're arresting academics, and you're about to see a giant wave of arrest.
[00:09:58.762 --> 00:10:01.143]  But it's not moving quick enough, with only 180 days left.
[00:10:02.023 --> 00:10:03.344]  This country's fighting for its life.
[00:10:03.384 --> 00:10:08.206]  And look, our government's had problems, and our military's had problems, and our intelligence agencies have had problems.
[00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:15.894]  You can look back at different political operations, different political dynasties, but America is fighting for its life.
[00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:16.975]  That means your future.
[00:10:17.495 --> 00:10:18.635]  That means our currency.
[00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:21.096]  That means our way of life.
[00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:26.557]  Everything's on the line, and people just better choose what side they're on and declare what side they're on.
[00:10:26.677 --> 00:10:29.018]  America or the Chai Koms and the Globalists.
[00:10:30.478 --> 00:10:32.859]  The Globalists and the Chai Koms are going to lose.
[00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:35.699]  The question is, how bad is this going to be?
[00:10:36.499 --> 00:10:38.300]  I'd rather they pick up their crap
[00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:39.972]  And get out.
[00:10:40.592 --> 00:10:41.133]  And stop it.
[00:10:41.193 --> 00:10:42.154]  But they can't, folks.
[00:10:42.514 --> 00:10:44.497]  Because they need to dominate the republic.
[00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:51.625]  They need to, to feel like they're better than us, and to try to enslave this juggernaut so that they can control and enslave the planet.
[00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:54.868]  We must not allow that to happen.
[00:10:57.251 --> 00:10:58.753]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:00.391]  U.S.
[00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:00.932]  and U.K.
[00:11:00.992 --> 00:11:08.577]  intelligence warned China is trying to hack biolabs working on COVID research so they can put out false numbers to create a panic.
[00:11:09.258 --> 00:11:09.938]  That's how U.S.
[00:11:09.998 --> 00:11:28.312]  intel, now controlled by patriots, partially, is telling you that China's behind the whole damn thing and behind the hysteria in the media and behind all the false diagnoses and all behind the actuaries set up and the coding at the hospitals by the NIH under WHO control, which is under Bill and Melinda Gates control.
[00:11:29.608 --> 00:11:31.389]  The World Depopulation Bureau.
[00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:46.334]  World Depopulation Bureau, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, United Nations WHO, NIH, World Health Service, and then also controls the National Health Service and other systems of major countries like the UK.
[00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:49.595]  And so
[00:11:52.369 --> 00:11:53.690]  That's how they're hyping up the deaths.
[00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.391]  That's how they're coding it where they pay you.
[00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.432]  I'm sorry, I was saying $39,000.
[00:11:57.472 --> 00:11:58.912]  That was just if they intubate you.
[00:11:59.393 --> 00:12:04.895]  It's $13,000 just to say you're COVID and then millions of your hospital says you have so many COVID patients in it.
[00:12:04.955 --> 00:12:11.179]  It's all just incentivized for fraud and doctors and lawyers and nurses are going public and saying we're being ordered to engage in fraud.
[00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:17.442]  And that's why the blue cities and blue states have all the cases because they are criminal institutions completely now.
[00:12:19.378 --> 00:12:19.678]  U.S.
[00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:21.099]  universities now shutting down.
[00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:23.500]  Arms of China propaganda machine.
[00:12:25.862 --> 00:12:26.322]  Video.
[00:12:26.362 --> 00:12:29.944]  Senator Cotton says China should provide evidence to disprove Corona lab leak.
[00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:32.345]  The government knows who did it.
[00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:34.587]  Because Obama has the receipts.
[00:12:35.407 --> 00:12:38.569]  China slams evil liar Pompeo over Wuhan lab nonsense.
[00:12:38.689 --> 00:12:39.930]  Yeah, it's nonsense, alright.
[00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:45.472]  Researcher on cusp of COVID-19 breakthrough killed in bizarre murder-suicide.
[00:12:45.492 --> 00:12:45.952]  Uh-huh.
[00:12:46.352 --> 00:12:47.793]  University of Pittsburgh researcher.
[00:12:47.813 --> 00:12:49.954]  A lot of loose ends getting covered up.
[00:12:52.874 --> 00:13:02.397]  Scientist whose doomsday medals and models sparked global lockdown resigns after breaking quarantine to bang married lover.
[00:13:04.298 --> 00:13:06.498]  He's the guy that said half a million dead in the UK.
[00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:07.839]  Three million dead here.
[00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:11.722]  Those estimates were 20, 30, 40, 50 times higher.
[00:13:13.263 --> 00:13:15.184]  Hollywood is complicit in Chinese censorship.
[00:13:15.244 --> 00:13:17.945]  Introduces bill to restrict productions.
[00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:20.746]  Yes, we shouldn't have foreign governments running Hollywood.
[00:13:20.806 --> 00:13:21.567]  See, it's all happening.
[00:13:22.727 --> 00:13:24.768]  Gates honored Obama admin.
[00:13:25.289 --> 00:13:28.010]  Appointed doctor wants to quote, get rid of all whites.
[00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.691]  That video is coming up.
[00:13:33.953 --> 00:13:36.654]  They want to make social distancing a permanent part of our lives.
[00:13:36.674 --> 00:13:38.895]  We're going to get to all of that and what that means.
[00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:46.951]  Also, Politico founder, I want a coronation of Joe Biden, not a rape investigation.
[00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:50.133]  He goes on to say he doesn't care if Joe Biden sexually assaults women.
[00:13:51.353 --> 00:13:54.515]  They're really showing who they are right now.
[00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:55.835]  Kavanaugh's innocent.
[00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:56.436]  He's the devil.
[00:13:58.197 --> 00:14:00.518]  Biden does it in public, grubs little children.
[00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:02.018]  He's wonderful.
[00:14:02.358 --> 00:14:04.820]  Well, of course the Democrats, they can't kill your child in the womb.
[00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:09.152]  They want to have convicted pedophiles have them ride horsey in public.
[00:14:09.692 --> 00:14:11.653]  By the way, now they're having strippers go to schools.
[00:14:12.013 --> 00:14:15.634]  I don't care if it's a 20-year-old stripper or a fat dude.
[00:14:15.714 --> 00:14:19.635]  Keep your perverts away from the kids, whether it's heterosexual or homosexual.
[00:14:19.935 --> 00:14:24.457]  A woman spreading her legs and humping at the kids and then pole dancing.
[00:14:24.477 --> 00:14:25.417]  Just get it off the screen.
[00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:27.758]  These people make me sick.
[00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:39.772]  We're going to look at how the markets have been intentionally broken and what's going to happen with the economy.
[00:14:42.433 --> 00:14:50.817]  And they've got major scientific groups with major insurance companies and actuaries working with the South African government.
[00:14:53.439 --> 00:14:55.980]  And even the commies down there have come out and figured out what's happening.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:01.163]  They said currently, this is out of the Financial Telegraph,
[00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:14.159]  Currently, it's causing 29 times more death, COVID-19, in Africa, just in South Africa, than it is by the virus.
[00:15:16.902 --> 00:15:27.470]  But see, while you starve to death and put your baby into a six-foot hole, it's okay, because you can wear your mask, even though nobody's dying.
[00:15:28.672 --> 00:15:32.173]  Less people are dying in South Africa now from COVID-19 than down from the flu, but it doesn't matter.
[00:15:32.493 --> 00:15:35.554]  The government says wear your mask and social distancing and everything's breaking down.
[00:15:35.814 --> 00:15:45.016]  The human food chain, the human infrastructure, the human network, the human grid is being destroyed for the computer grid to take over.
[00:15:46.716 --> 00:15:50.277]  Oh, and they admit, Bill Gates and all of them, it's a post-human world.
[00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.958]  That means you and I.
[00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:04.464]  You know, a few months ago we had llamas in studio just to have some fun.
[00:16:04.484 --> 00:16:14.533]  And who knew, out of Europe, one of the most promising treatments for COVID-19 is antibodies out of the blood of llamas.
[00:16:15.314 --> 00:16:17.456]  And they're finding that it just completely knocks it out.
[00:16:18.695 --> 00:16:19.375]  So there you go.
[00:16:19.936 --> 00:16:20.896]  That was actually last year.
[00:16:21.036 --> 00:16:26.539]  So tomorrow's news today, ladies and gentlemen, yet again, we bring you the llama.
[00:16:31.142 --> 00:16:34.864]  My daughter, my youngest daughter, had her birthday yesterday.
[00:16:34.884 --> 00:16:44.969]  And I don't know why my wife had llama little napkins, yellow napkins with pink llamas on them.
[00:16:44.989 --> 00:16:45.949]  These llamas are everywhere.
[00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:46.870]  What's going on with the llamas?
[00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:49.728]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:16:49.748 --> 00:16:50.749]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:51.729]  Coming up next segment,
[00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:23.169]  Bill Gates has come out and said that we need to have a global collapse and just get used to it to save us from not even a million people dead from coronavirus, not even 500,000 dead from coronavirus, not even 300,000 dead.
[00:17:23.389 --> 00:17:24.430]  Just doesn't matter.
[00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:32.104]  Because he's a vaccine maker and he says that vaccines sterilize you and he says that you need to take his vaccines and that's just the way it is.
[00:17:32.144 --> 00:17:33.985]  He's also announced we need a global government.
[00:17:34.505 --> 00:17:42.769]  These video clips are coming up to enforce the forced inoculation of everyone on earth and that will also have a digital ID with it that you have to have to travel.
[00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:48.512]  And it's being announced all over the world that that's the way it is starting at the end of the year.
[00:17:49.532 --> 00:17:51.993]  Oh yeah, they said they wouldn't have the vaccine for a few years now.
[00:17:52.053 --> 00:17:57.736]  Magically, they're gonna have it by the end of the year, and he's got seven different manufacturers making it.
[00:17:58.236 --> 00:17:59.357]  Who died and made him God?
[00:17:59.377 --> 00:18:00.677]  Who gave them the keys to the world?
[00:18:00.717 --> 00:18:01.418]  I've been telling you!
[00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:07.200]  Bill Gates is the most powerful globalist we know of, who's actually involved running things.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.582]  The Rothschilds are very powerful, but they are back in the shadows.
[00:18:10.662 --> 00:18:14.844]  The Rockefellers have pretty much died out, but their powerful foundations are there.
[00:18:14.884 --> 00:18:17.245]  But these are the folks that run the show.
[00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:19.907]  Now, let's get into this right now.
[00:18:20.047 --> 00:18:20.828]  Look at this headline.
[00:18:20.848 --> 00:18:31.139]  It says, out of the Stanford Advocate, conspiracy theories run rampant when people feel helpless, like now.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.145]  We'll know when you put out your bell curves that are all completely false.
[00:18:39.011 --> 00:18:41.872]  And that are 20, 30 times higher than what's actually died.
[00:18:41.892 --> 00:18:51.794]  And then we learn that you're padding the numbers with people that come into the hospital that are 80 years old, 90 years old, that die of heart attacks or cancer or automobile accidents.
[00:18:52.874 --> 00:18:59.155]  And that you admit that you're saying people had COVID without even giving a test most of the time.
[00:18:59.515 --> 00:19:02.356]  We don't believe a damn word comes out of your criminal mouths.
[00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:09.432]  Meanwhile, double black swan hitting Texas drags down the rest of the United States.
[00:19:10.852 --> 00:19:13.913]  18 signs that we're facing a record-breaking economic implosion.
[00:19:14.473 --> 00:19:16.273]  That story's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:18.333]  You should go read this for yourself.
[00:19:19.154 --> 00:19:24.815]  Disney reports 58% drop in operating income from parks and cruises, the worst hit segment.
[00:19:25.635 --> 00:19:27.655]  Disney profit plunged 91%.
[00:19:29.115 --> 00:19:32.896]  The layoffs at Airbnb cast a dark shadow over Silicon Valley.
[00:19:34.053 --> 00:19:38.496]  Apple borrows $8.5 billion, joins record corporate debt borrowing spree.
[00:19:39.617 --> 00:19:41.778]  After all, it's public money being put out.
[00:19:42.219 --> 00:19:42.479]  U.S.
[00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:49.163]  private payrolls dropped $20.2 million in April, the worst job loss in the history, ADP reports.
[00:19:49.643 --> 00:19:54.086]  Layoffs start turning from temporary to permanent across America.
[00:19:54.567 --> 00:20:03.273]  Bloomberg announces, with pleasure, this is an economic attack on you, punishment for you for trying to be free.
[00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:07.106]  And it goes on from there.
[00:20:08.467 --> 00:20:12.708]  But let's talk about what's really going to happen.
[00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:24.933]  A global financial shutdown and they will call for a global Marshall Plan to be run by the same corporate world government where communist China is the model of the social credit score.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:38.965]  Where Communist China is the model of the surveillance grid, where it's the model of the police state, where it's the model of the economy, where it's the model of the medical forced inoculation tyranny.
[00:20:39.285 --> 00:20:41.846]  And Bill Gates says China is perfect.
[00:20:43.147 --> 00:20:44.007]  America is not.
[00:20:44.127 --> 00:20:45.068]  Next segment, I'll show you.
[00:20:45.108 --> 00:20:49.329]  This is what he's crawling out of his rat hole saying to everybody.
[00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.430]  Look at this article.
[00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.792]  How governments broke the oil market.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.602]  And it lays out how the chain is going to be irrevocably damaged for decades.
[00:21:03.102 --> 00:21:04.503]  Oh, and we're only two months in.
[00:21:04.523 --> 00:21:11.786]  See, once you spin something up this powerful, once you turn it off, it never really turns back on like the way it did.
[00:21:12.387 --> 00:21:18.689]  Violent criminals released while working moms try to feed their kids are jailed like the moms shut down for several months in Dallas.
[00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.991]  Oh, Walmart and Costco are essential.
[00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:26.773]  But people that own their own business and cut your hair, they're not!
[00:21:28.131 --> 00:21:33.073]  The power to tax, the power to destroy, the power to have house arrests is the power to kill.
[00:21:34.534 --> 00:21:35.294]  And that's what this is.
[00:21:37.795 --> 00:21:43.437]  California leftists using coronavirus to transform the state and make everyone dependent.
[00:21:44.277 --> 00:21:46.338]  That's just some of the news.
[00:21:46.378 --> 00:21:49.219]  But here's the really big one right here.
[00:21:49.419 --> 00:21:52.441]  And then we'll go to break and come back and get into Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:21:52.461 --> 00:21:53.221]  This is out of the
[00:21:55.563 --> 00:21:58.866]  News in Australia, the Financial Mail, very respected paper.
[00:22:00.067 --> 00:22:09.096]  And in the article, lockdown disaster dwarfs COVID-19, says actuaries, South African insurance companies.
[00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:16.403]  They say it's irrevocable and will actually take years off people's lives, just in general.
[00:22:16.904 --> 00:22:18.045]  It's the end of civilization.
[00:22:19.414 --> 00:22:29.626]  And that's just a few months of the shutdown going on and that's out of the very respected Financial Telegraph and French News Agency.
[00:22:29.967 --> 00:22:38.677]  So remember last week I was telling you when the UN said COVID-19 is causing 30 plus million to be starving now, 135 million to starve in the next...
[00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:43.122]  I said, it's not COVID-19, it's the COVID-19 lockdown.
[00:22:43.383 --> 00:22:50.925]  Well, finally, the South African insurance companies say lockdown disaster dwarfs COVID-19.
[00:22:51.125 --> 00:22:51.906]  Exactly.
[00:22:53.146 --> 00:22:56.627]  COVID-19 is not causing the stampede and the collapse.
[00:22:57.188 --> 00:22:59.929]  The stampede is causing the collapse.
[00:22:59.969 --> 00:23:02.930]  Big article on Infowars.com breaking it down.
[00:23:04.093 --> 00:23:05.594]  By Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:23:05.654 --> 00:23:09.217]  Hope you'll share it, because if you don't, it's Road Warrior in about a year.
[00:23:09.817 --> 00:23:11.518]  South African data analyst.
[00:23:12.219 --> 00:23:15.841]  Lockdown will lead to 29 times more deaths than coronavirus.
[00:23:16.221 --> 00:23:23.386]  We had a consortium of insurance companies, scientists and doctors, and the government say, OK, we might want to end this.
[00:23:23.887 --> 00:23:24.948]  Probably too late.
[00:23:25.208 --> 00:23:26.649]  You were already on the verge of collapse.
[00:23:27.229 --> 00:23:28.770]  Millions will die there alone.
[00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:32.533]  But it's OK, because we were virtue signaling against COVID.
[00:23:33.939 --> 00:23:38.501]  Meanwhile, El Chapo's son imposes coronavirus lockdown and tortures violators.
[00:23:38.781 --> 00:23:39.701]  This is no game.
[00:23:39.981 --> 00:23:42.442]  Oh, the media's like, even drug dealers are heroes.
[00:23:42.502 --> 00:23:44.583]  Yeah, tyrants are using this for control.
[00:23:44.903 --> 00:23:49.144]  Bahamas, Haiti want negative COVID tests for returning citizens.
[00:23:49.504 --> 00:23:51.705]  Antigua wants shame for tourists.
[00:23:51.725 --> 00:23:53.766]  That'll be the new global ID, Yahoo News.
[00:23:54.326 --> 00:23:54.926]  It's all coming up.
[00:23:56.027 --> 00:23:56.387]  By the way,
[00:23:57.668 --> 00:24:00.292]  If you don't have storable food, you are insane.
[00:24:00.452 --> 00:24:05.860]  And all the other storable food companies are either sold out or selling you ancient, dried out, overpriced crap.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:12.831]  We have fresh, quality, being packaged right now, the best storable food you're going to find for the price out there.
[00:24:13.692 --> 00:24:16.232]  It takes a few weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[00:24:16.272 --> 00:24:18.333]  But when you order food from us, they have it.
[00:24:18.673 --> 00:24:23.614]  And everybody that's ordered so far has gotten it in the time they said they would or earlier.
[00:24:24.214 --> 00:24:27.274]  But it's coming up on a time because food sales went down.
[00:24:27.354 --> 00:24:29.195]  We had to pause sales a few weeks while they got caught up.
[00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:30.675]  Now they're ramping back up.
[00:24:30.975 --> 00:24:36.576]  We're easily by this weekend, next week, if sales continue like this, they're going to have to pause sales again.
[00:24:36.596 --> 00:24:39.296]  But if you get your order in now, you will get the food.
[00:24:39.697 --> 00:24:42.037]  Last 25 years, it's nutritious, it's high quality.
[00:24:43.123 --> 00:24:46.854]  Hope for the best, prepare for the worst, get it, have it, delay there.
[00:24:46.934 --> 00:24:48.659]  And if you want to stock up on the products.
[00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.331]  Amazing products like our ultimate krill oil back in stock.
[00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:54.132]  Body's selling out, still 50% off.
[00:24:54.512 --> 00:24:55.593]  Krill oil, 50% off.
[00:24:55.993 --> 00:24:57.234]  DNA Force, still 50% off.
[00:24:57.474 --> 00:24:58.154]  So I want you to get it.
[00:24:58.314 --> 00:25:01.816]  All these things are so good for your body's defenses and are the highest quality.
[00:25:01.836 --> 00:25:03.517]  PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more.
[00:25:03.857 --> 00:25:04.718]  And DNA Force Plus.
[00:25:04.798 --> 00:25:05.578]  Everybody should get that.
[00:25:06.178 --> 00:25:10.440]  And we're already talking to our suppliers, and some of them are saying, we may not take orders in a few months.
[00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:12.521]  I may not ever be able to get products again.
[00:25:12.802 --> 00:25:14.683]  Things are collapsing so bad, folks.
[00:25:14.883 --> 00:25:16.503]  This is total depression.
[00:25:16.523 --> 00:25:17.964]  The infrastructure is going down.
[00:25:18.164 --> 00:25:19.245]  Get the products while you still can.
[00:25:20.543 --> 00:25:22.144]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:25:22.204 --> 00:25:34.751]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I come to you with grave tidings and a desperate warning that you heed my warning or be enslaved, impoverished, finally starved to death and killed.
[00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:48.439]  I was thinking just a minute ago before we went live into this segment, how I could describe this because it's indescribably horrible, but it's the truth and only the truth can save us.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.041]  My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:25:53.101 --> 00:25:54.842]  The articles are on Infowars.com.
[00:25:55.002 --> 00:25:56.323]  We're going to play the clips right now.
[00:25:57.183 --> 00:26:01.164]  Bill Gates is planet Earth's first dictator.
[00:26:01.664 --> 00:26:01.805]  Oh!
[00:26:03.185 --> 00:26:04.866]  And he wants to depopulate the planet.
[00:26:06.886 --> 00:26:07.006]  Oh!
[00:26:08.107 --> 00:26:10.608]  And he wants to get rid of the middle class, on record.
[00:26:11.928 --> 00:26:16.250]  And he finances major leaders
[00:26:17.964 --> 00:26:20.025]  Who push anti-white agendas.
[00:26:20.685 --> 00:26:23.227]  You go, why does he want to kill the black people and the white people?
[00:26:23.827 --> 00:26:25.588]  Jack Spratt could eat no fat.
[00:26:26.468 --> 00:26:27.909]  His wife could eat no lean.
[00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.711]  So between the two, they lick the platter clean.
[00:26:32.892 --> 00:26:34.632]  He wants us divided against each other.
[00:26:34.652 --> 00:26:38.574]  He wants us killing each other while he inherits the future.
[00:26:39.555 --> 00:26:41.496]  Learn who he is or be destroyed.
[00:26:42.156 --> 00:26:43.337]  I personally am facing
[00:26:44.608 --> 00:26:51.491]  Arrest death right now because I refuse to stop attacking Gates, but I will continue because I will not submit to Satan.
[00:26:52.371 --> 00:26:54.572]  Now, let's go ahead and go over the facts.
[00:26:55.592 --> 00:27:12.739]  Earlier, I read to you out of the Financial Telegraph, major insurance companies in South Africa have openly come out and said that COVID-19 is not causing mass death, that the lockdowns dwarf it massively.
[00:27:14.467 --> 00:27:18.469]  29 times more destructive than the COVID-19 deaths.
[00:27:19.169 --> 00:27:21.451]  And that's just getting started.
[00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:37.821]  So with that said, the head of the World Food Program that we'll play in a few minutes came out two weeks ago and said 135 million are on the verge of starving, an extra 30 million are starving right now, on top of the 10 million that usually starve.
[00:27:42.073 --> 00:27:43.214]  Think about those numbers.
[00:27:43.854 --> 00:27:45.855]  And those are accurate numbers, probably conservative.
[00:27:47.676 --> 00:27:55.239]  And what happens is you just shrivel up, you get sick, the bones are sticking out your side, and any common cold or flu comes by, you just die in the night.
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.962]  And they just say that, oh, you died of the flu, you died of the cold, but you know, you died of starvation, of malnutrition.
[00:28:02.143 --> 00:28:05.825]  So here's Bill Gates that's constantly everywhere saying we need to reduce the world population.
[00:28:05.845 --> 00:28:06.745]  You pull up the London Guardian.
[00:28:07.105 --> 00:28:10.607]  Bill Gates is worried about the black population in Africa growing.
[00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.374]  But he wants to give you a shot because he wants you to live.
[00:28:15.175 --> 00:28:16.256]  G, I want you to die.
[00:28:16.316 --> 00:28:17.177]  Please take this shot.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.703]  Now, let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:28:21.723 --> 00:28:24.286]  Bill Gates, the Financial Times of London.
[00:28:24.747 --> 00:28:26.529]  Normalcy only returns when we've
[00:28:28.584 --> 00:28:31.305]  Largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[00:28:31.325 --> 00:28:32.345]  Remember what he said two weeks ago?
[00:28:32.365 --> 00:28:36.266]  700,000 will get sick or die from bad reactions.
[00:28:36.286 --> 00:28:37.426]  Of course, that's his number.
[00:28:37.546 --> 00:28:38.867]  It's not 1 in 10,000, folks.
[00:28:38.927 --> 00:28:41.167]  It's like 1 in 10 that have bad reactions.
[00:28:41.207 --> 00:28:41.848]  You all know that.
[00:28:42.168 --> 00:28:43.968]  Most of you have had a bad reaction from a vaccine.
[00:28:46.589 --> 00:28:47.189]  Continuing.
[00:28:48.868 --> 00:28:55.431]  In another clip, he says, America can't do it perfectly like China, so we're going to have problems with the contact tracing.
[00:28:55.451 --> 00:28:56.691]  See, China's perfect!
[00:28:57.171 --> 00:28:59.692]  Three million Muslims in death camps.
[00:29:01.253 --> 00:29:02.753]  Bill Gates on vaccinating the world.
[00:29:03.614 --> 00:29:08.256]  Again, this is the first planetary world government through the UN, WHO.
[00:29:08.276 --> 00:29:14.058]  Because they've learned, like in Rwanda, when the UN shows up and encircles a town, and then when the
[00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.531]  Animus go in to kill the Christians with machetes.
[00:29:20.691 --> 00:29:22.871]  Anybody that tries to get out, the UN machine guns.
[00:29:23.812 --> 00:29:28.873]  Then you hear in the news, oh, the UN couldn't protect the poor Christian minority in Rwanda.
[00:29:29.113 --> 00:29:31.473]  No, it later came out they ran the extermination.
[00:29:31.914 --> 00:29:33.114]  But the Africans fight back.
[00:29:33.834 --> 00:29:36.875]  And a lot of times, barehanded, defeat the UN.
[00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:40.896]  And defeat the black tribes they're funding.
[00:29:42.876 --> 00:29:45.557]  So now they go, oh, we're coming with shots.
[00:29:46.598 --> 00:29:51.580]  We're coming to help you, and they've learned that people will trust someone in a white lab coat, but still now the Africans run.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.322]  So now Bill Gates is coming out with crops that have the vaccine GMO in them.
[00:29:58.063 --> 00:29:59.964]  I first saw that with Protogen 25 years ago.
[00:29:59.984 --> 00:30:00.544]  People didn't believe me.
[00:30:00.564 --> 00:30:03.846]  Now it's mainline news that, oh, you'll soon get vaccines in your banana.
[00:30:05.466 --> 00:30:07.027]  They can engineer it into the banana.
[00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:12.608]  So let's go ahead and play Bill Gates.
[00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:18.216]  Normalcy only returns when you take the vaccine and then have the ID or the chip to prove it.
[00:30:18.256 --> 00:30:18.537]  Here it is.
[00:30:20.132 --> 00:30:22.193]  Well, it won't go to zero, but it will shrink.
[00:30:22.213 --> 00:30:23.133]  Global GDP is going to take
[00:30:44.028 --> 00:30:46.109]  You know, probably the biggest hit ever.
[00:30:46.709 --> 00:30:49.589]  You know, maybe the Depression was worse or 1873.
[00:30:49.649 --> 00:30:50.049]  I don't know.
[00:30:50.109 --> 00:30:55.871]  But in my lifetime there, this will be the greatest economic hit.
[00:30:56.191 --> 00:30:57.471]  But you don't have a choice.
[00:30:57.531 --> 00:30:58.852]  People act like you have a choice.
[00:30:59.372 --> 00:31:04.953]  People don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected.
[00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:09.994]  You know, it's not the government who's saying, OK, just ignore this disease.
[00:31:10.114 --> 00:31:13.475]  You know, people are deeply affected.
[00:31:14.386 --> 00:31:23.811]  By seeing these deaths, by knowing they could be part of the transmission chain, and old people, their parents, their grandparents could be affected by this.
[00:31:23.911 --> 00:31:25.252]  And so you don't
[00:31:26.241 --> 00:31:31.222]  You don't get to say, ignore what's going on here.
[00:31:31.842 --> 00:31:38.924]  There will be the ability, particularly in rich countries, to open up if things are done well over the next few months.
[00:31:39.504 --> 00:31:49.807]  But for the world at large, normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[00:31:51.374 --> 00:32:05.158]  You know, although there's a lot of work on testing, a lot of work on drugs that we're involved with, you know, trying to achieve that ambitious goal, which has never been done for the vaccine, that rises to the top of the list.
[00:32:06.459 --> 00:32:19.162]  So he's in charge of the big foundations, all the tax-free money, Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, IBM Trust that was, Watson when he died, dedicated it to Hitler and the global population.
[00:32:19.182 --> 00:32:20.943]  So now he just says it never comes back to normal.
[00:32:22.028 --> 00:32:25.451]  Oh, here in the first world, maybe for a little while until we clamp it back down again.
[00:32:26.252 --> 00:32:26.932]  This is all a plan.
[00:32:26.952 --> 00:32:29.655]  It doesn't matter if the global death will be hundreds of times.
[00:32:30.055 --> 00:32:35.680]  He just says, oh, everyone knows that they're guilty and they're going to do this because they want to play along with it.
[00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:38.542]  They've all psychologically war game this out.
[00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:40.124]  They think you're going to play along.
[00:32:40.784 --> 00:32:43.907]  Well, you're going to lose everything you got in the process because you're so afraid of something.
[00:32:44.167 --> 00:32:46.189]  It turns out is a giant hoax.
[00:32:46.349 --> 00:32:47.530]  It's a manufactured weapon.
[00:32:48.371 --> 00:32:51.052]  That causes the collapse of society through its fear.
[00:32:51.473 --> 00:32:55.335]  It is manufactured so Bill and Melinda Gates could own the patent on the vaccines.
[00:32:56.355 --> 00:32:57.476]  Let's play the next clip.
[00:32:58.616 --> 00:33:02.578]  Bill Gates on contact tracing basically says China does a perfect job.
[00:33:02.638 --> 00:33:03.599]  We don't do a good job.
[00:33:03.819 --> 00:33:04.960]  So see China's perfect.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.320]  Here it is.
[00:33:05.967 --> 00:33:11.348]  The epidemic in the United States is more widespread than it ever got in South Korea.
[00:33:11.368 --> 00:33:18.710]  So we're like the part of China, Hubei province, where a lot of the cases were in one city, Wuhan.
[00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.230]  And the U.S.
[00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.290]  and China are different.
[00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:27.792]  You know, the lockdowns that we do won't be as strictly enforced, but they are very, very important.
[00:33:28.232 --> 00:33:34.293]  The way we do contact tracing won't be as invasive and so won't be quite as perfect.
[00:33:34.813 --> 00:33:35.934]  So this is what he's talking about.
[00:33:35.954 --> 00:33:36.855]  This is what he's doing.
[00:33:38.076 --> 00:33:43.279]  And South Korea didn't have a problem because they didn't do false positives.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.663]  And they didn't kill their people snaking ventilators down their throats.
[00:33:48.623 --> 00:33:49.024]  Innovating.
[00:33:50.084 --> 00:33:53.487]  And they didn't pay $39,000 to put a ventilator on somebody.
[00:33:54.227 --> 00:33:55.008]  They don't have blue states.
[00:33:55.028 --> 00:34:02.954]  They don't have blue cities with people like Cuomo and people like Governor Newsom with the heroin needles and the feces everywhere and the fentanyl and the death.
[00:34:04.178 --> 00:34:05.939]  So this is their takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:05.979 --> 00:34:13.863]  More Bill Gates on forcibly vaccinating the entire world as he becomes the first world dictator of the planet.
[00:34:14.663 --> 00:34:16.964]  Whatever you do, folks, spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:34:16.984 --> 00:34:20.186]  Don't know how much longer we'll be here because the tyranny is here.
[00:34:20.206 --> 00:34:22.847]  Imperial troops have entered the base.
[00:34:24.268 --> 00:34:31.892]  If you're a radio listener, you're blessed because you don't have to look at Bill Gates, snicker and smile and giggle.
[00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:41.125]  When he talks about a planetary collapse, and how the world's never coming back, and how they're going to have a forced inoculation of every man, woman, and child on the planet.
[00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:44.509]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:50.835]  We're going to play you some of that audio and video when he was on CNN with Fareed Zakaria of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:59.492]  And Fareed says the economy's not going to come back for a long time, and Bill starts giggling and laughing and looking like he just had an orgasm.
[00:35:00.293 --> 00:35:03.614]  He is the Earth's first planetary dictator.
[00:35:05.054 --> 00:35:12.657]  He's all over TV, he's all over everything, leading and guiding and directing us and saying, sorry, there is no choice.
[00:35:13.357 --> 00:35:14.217]  It's never coming back.
[00:35:15.157 --> 00:35:19.159]  First it was two weeks, then it was two months, and now
[00:35:20.646 --> 00:35:25.548]  He said, oh, for some of the richer countries, maybe you'll have a little bit of time before we lock you back down.
[00:35:25.588 --> 00:35:26.208]  I just played this.
[00:35:27.568 --> 00:35:31.109]  But for the rest of the world, it's not coming back.
[00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.730]  And hundreds of millions will starve to death.
[00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:34.910]  And it'll just be a little footnote.
[00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:35.330]  Yeah.
[00:35:36.131 --> 00:35:42.173]  But people in America know not to go out and do things anymore and go out and buy things.
[00:35:42.233 --> 00:35:46.754]  And as the world economy collapses, the third world dependent on us, they're dead.
[00:35:48.899 --> 00:35:49.640]  It's totally sick.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.061]  We're gonna play the audio and the video of him.
[00:35:53.342 --> 00:36:09.493]  I mean, you thought Beto was bad when you thought the guy running against the other Democrats for the nomination was bad here in Texas, smiling, when they talked about, you know, there's so many people shot.
[00:36:11.034 --> 00:36:11.855]  You thought that was good?
[00:36:11.875 --> 00:36:12.855]  You thought that was sick?
[00:36:15.145 --> 00:36:21.148]  In fact, let's just go ahead and go to the video and audio of Bill Gates on CNN, just looking like he just saw his newborn son or daughter.
[00:36:21.388 --> 00:36:22.388]  He's just the happiest.
[00:36:23.088 --> 00:36:32.392]  You never see him look happy, but when he talks about forced inoculation or death or starvation or talks about reducing human population and a dead dog, he just starts skipping around and hopping around like a demonic elf.
[00:36:32.432 --> 00:36:32.832]  Here it is.
[00:36:34.133 --> 00:36:36.854]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[00:36:36.874 --> 00:36:38.915]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:36:38.995 --> 00:36:43.497]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[00:36:46.345 --> 00:36:51.409]  Should we play the TED Talk where he says, we've got to do a really good job.
[00:36:51.529 --> 00:36:52.670]  I can't imitate him well.
[00:36:54.591 --> 00:37:06.880]  Well, if we do a really good job on all these things, cutting carbon, cutting industry, cutting our consumership, and we cut the human population, we might be able to get this number down close to zero.
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:13.785]  And everyone starts giggling because the number lit up in the equation is P for people.
[00:37:16.363 --> 00:37:19.664]  This isn't E equals MC squared, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:20.725 --> 00:37:27.928]  This isn't about energy and being derived from matter and action and all the rest of it.
[00:37:27.988 --> 00:37:31.929]  This is the end of civilization as we know it.
[00:37:32.429 --> 00:37:34.690]  In fact, this is the most shocking video ever.
[00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.271]  I should just roll this for the next five hours here.
[00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:41.373]  Bill Gates on CNN last weekend
[00:37:42.173 --> 00:37:45.415]  And I forgot when I saw this clip, I meant to play it, but I'm just so used to him.
[00:37:45.935 --> 00:37:54.399]  Somebody's got to put together another compilation of him when he talks about death and forced inoculations and world government and the economy's never turning back on.
[00:37:54.719 --> 00:37:59.362]  Radio listeners, we're going to post this right now to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:37:59.702 --> 00:38:06.205]  Watch Bill Gates become overjoyed
[00:38:09.634 --> 00:38:14.717]  Bill Gates becomes overjoyed while discussing permanent global collapse, mass death.
[00:38:14.937 --> 00:38:15.337]  Here it is.
[00:38:19.199 --> 00:38:21.940]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.021]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:38:24.081 --> 00:38:28.603]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[00:38:30.383 --> 00:38:33.645]  Imagine Farid Zarqari is like, it'll never come back.
[00:38:33.725 --> 00:38:34.385]  It's going to be horrible.
[00:38:34.405 --> 00:38:34.965]  It's going to be terrible.
[00:38:35.005 --> 00:38:36.806]  And Bill's just like, all of a sudden he's sitting there.
[00:38:43.572 --> 00:38:45.513]  Oh my gosh, this is completely sick.
[00:38:46.514 --> 00:38:48.895]  Here, let's look at that face.
[00:38:51.957 --> 00:38:54.738]  He's just so damn happy they're saving the earth.
[00:38:54.998 --> 00:38:56.479]  They finally blew up the economy.
[00:38:56.519 --> 00:38:58.080]  They finally brought in the Green New Deal.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.761]  They admit it was to get rid of humans.
[00:39:00.542 --> 00:39:01.182]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:39:01.622 --> 00:39:02.783]  The evolution of Bill Gates.
[00:39:03.503 --> 00:39:04.324]  Rattle, rattle.
[00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:07.946]  Microsoft and all the money and now GMO and
[00:39:08.837 --> 00:39:11.458]  Mandatory vaccines, I mean, you name it, he's involved, but don't worry.
[00:39:12.959 --> 00:39:16.581]  You know who the main funder of, quote, choice in education is?
[00:39:16.681 --> 00:39:24.906]  Which sounds good, but it's, it's, it's, they ruin the public schools, try to block the private schools, now they come in and buy up the schools for pennies on the dollar.
[00:39:24.966 --> 00:39:27.067]  They buy up the curriculum, not the school itself.
[00:39:28.468 --> 00:39:34.151]  They pay the schools up to a third of their budget to run their curricula, and here it is, Reuters!
[00:39:34.931 --> 00:39:37.413]  New York to work with the Gates Foundation to
[00:39:38.911 --> 00:39:42.173]  Reimagine school, says the governor.
[00:39:44.195 --> 00:39:56.204]  Oh, and they're going to keep you at home now, and you only go to school maybe once a week for activities or events, and you get the Bill and Melinda Gates curriculum, and you never hear about all those people in Latin America, Africa, and Asia starving to death.
[00:39:58.065 --> 00:39:59.146]  After all, it's for the earth.
[00:39:59.226 --> 00:40:02.208]  It's them doing the best job they can.
[00:40:02.248 --> 00:40:03.169]  He's your king.
[00:40:03.189 --> 00:40:04.229]  He's your lord.
[00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:04.990]  He's your president.
[00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.890]  He's your doctor.
[00:40:06.331 --> 00:40:07.171]  He's your master.
[00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:13.027]  And he's going to put things in your body, and you're not going to say no, or you're not going to travel or live!
[00:40:13.047 --> 00:40:15.428]  You're going to take a chip in your arm.
[00:40:16.588 --> 00:40:20.129]  Because China, as he said last segment, is perfect.
[00:40:20.469 --> 00:40:22.289]  We're not going to be perfect like China.
[00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:28.311]  Welding people into their homes, shooting women in the head at checkpoints, 3 million in death camps.
[00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:32.492]  We're not going to be perfect, you know, shutting down South Africa and causing mass death.
[00:40:35.013 --> 00:40:36.133]  But it's okay, because Trevor Noah,
[00:40:37.622 --> 00:40:42.606]  He's part African and from South Africa, so it's like, oh, he'll be there overseeing it as well.
[00:40:43.587 --> 00:40:44.788]  Oh, good.
[00:40:45.388 --> 00:40:46.509]  Good, Trevor Noah.
[00:40:47.149 --> 00:40:47.870]  Good.
[00:40:50.072 --> 00:40:55.136]  Here's Bill Gates on vaccinating the entire world with Trevor Noah.
[00:40:55.156 --> 00:40:55.496]  Go ahead.
[00:40:56.693 --> 00:41:00.958]  We'll have a lot of unusual measures until we get the world vaccinated.
[00:41:01.579 --> 00:41:13.452]  Seven billion people, that's a tall order, but it is where we need to get to, despite a lot of things in between now and then, to minimize the damage.
[00:41:13.837 --> 00:41:22.002]  And then, of course, there's always going to be a new pathogen that comes out of a lab he runs and funds, and that Fauci funds and runs.
[00:41:22.603 --> 00:41:26.245]  And it won't matter, yes, patented coronavirus won't matter that he makes the money off of it.
[00:41:26.465 --> 00:41:28.787]  We'll just dutifully say, yes, sir, there's no choice.
[00:41:31.647 --> 00:41:42.731]  But see, I want all seven crates of the seven he's having produced, I want to be able to go to the factories, get them myself, and then I want to be able to inject Bill Gates with them myself.
[00:41:42.751 --> 00:41:44.992]  Because I mean, I know he knows they're good for us.
[00:41:45.732 --> 00:41:53.214]  So I want him to take all the vaccines, not like they did at the Golden Globe Awards where they have nurses run around with fake syringes and give everybody their shots.
[00:41:53.674 --> 00:41:54.995]  Oh, everybody get your shots now.
[00:41:55.055 --> 00:41:56.455]  It's so cool, the trendy people.
[00:41:56.775 --> 00:41:58.116]  How stupid are we?
[00:42:01.613 --> 00:42:02.814]  But you see the virtue signalers.
[00:42:02.894 --> 00:42:06.517]  I went for like a nice three, four mile walk this morning hike.
[00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:11.001]  And there'd be areas of the hike and bike trail that are 25 feet wide.
[00:42:12.943 --> 00:42:16.486]  And you'd see every fifth or sixth person like up against the leaves.
[00:42:18.268 --> 00:42:20.670]  It's like, hey, Africa's starving you dumb ass.
[00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:21.351]  It's made up.
[00:42:21.591 --> 00:42:22.071]  I'm serious.
[00:42:22.111 --> 00:42:23.072]  I shut my mouth.
[00:42:23.232 --> 00:42:24.013]  We're just trying to help.
[00:42:24.073 --> 00:42:24.333]  Come on.
[00:42:25.174 --> 00:42:25.434]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:25.454 --> 00:42:26.215]  We're just trying to help.
[00:42:27.736 --> 00:42:28.497]  You're an idiot.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.662]  You're a virtue signaler.
[00:42:30.802 --> 00:42:32.845]  You should always boost your immune system.
[00:42:32.865 --> 00:42:39.133]  You should always be taking vitamin D3 and vitamin C. You should always be trying to get extra iodine in your body.
[00:42:39.173 --> 00:42:40.295]  That's what your body's built of.
[00:42:42.728 --> 00:42:49.315]  Globalists want to be populated while you've got all these billionaires living on their palatial estates and they have all this cash and everything.
[00:42:49.615 --> 00:42:52.558]  They've got all their helicopters and their jets and their mistresses.
[00:42:53.259 --> 00:42:56.262]  They don't like flying over cities and seeing you moving around having a life.
[00:42:56.483 --> 00:42:57.584]  They don't like seeing your swimming pools.
[00:42:57.604 --> 00:42:59.706]  They don't like seeing your happy kids because they're miserable.
[00:42:59.986 --> 00:43:01.908]  So they want to make you miserable like them.
[00:43:02.149 --> 00:43:03.930]  So they're locking your ass down.
[00:43:04.491 --> 00:43:13.821]  And then telling you until you accept medical tyranny and us putting in your body what we want to put in you and until you pay with taxpayer money to give us liability protection.
[00:43:15.103 --> 00:43:18.887]  Hey, don't complain just because you got cancer or had a seizure or your kid died.
[00:43:19.107 --> 00:43:22.971]  It's the price we pay to be able to go outside and have a job again.
[00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:25.354]  We're being held hostage.
[00:43:27.554 --> 00:43:31.875]  I knew this was what was going on 12 weeks ago, but I wasn't sure about it until I saw it.
[00:43:31.915 --> 00:43:34.156]  And then when they said two weeks, I said, it's never.
[00:43:34.236 --> 00:43:35.116]  It's not two years.
[00:43:35.176 --> 00:43:36.277]  It's not 200 years.
[00:43:36.357 --> 00:43:37.997]  It's the end of civilization.
[00:43:38.057 --> 00:43:40.758]  And now they're bragging, hey, this is shutting off the economy.
[00:43:41.258 --> 00:43:44.299]  Hey, this is going to stop, you know, the people producing.
[00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:45.500]  This is going to save the earth.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.761]  But really, it's just them taking over with modern feudalism.
[00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:51.330]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:55.793]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back in stock, like Krill Oil.
[00:43:56.053 --> 00:43:56.894]  We have the ultimate Krill Oil.

[00:44:10.212 --> 00:44:11.454]  Infowarsstore.com.

[00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:30.830]  It's got some stimulant in it, natural caffeine.
[00:44:32.511 --> 00:44:34.253]  That's close to selling out.
[00:44:34.273 --> 00:44:34.673]  50% off still.
[00:44:35.093 --> 00:44:40.517]  Infowarstore.com and we have the new 5G Kills shirts in two different varieties.
[00:44:40.597 --> 00:44:45.981]  It all funds the InfoWar and helps you get the word out in the face of these tyrants that would silence you in
[00:44:46.721 --> 00:44:47.381]  Cyberspace?
[00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:51.003]  Well, you promote freedom and truth in the first dimension.
[00:44:51.043 --> 00:44:51.463]  Stay with us.
[00:44:51.483 --> 00:44:52.304]  Paul Watson coming up.
[00:44:54.345 --> 00:44:56.986]  Up in my hometown, they're saying she's a traitor.
[00:44:58.007 --> 00:44:58.987]  Saying she's a criminal.
[00:44:59.687 --> 00:45:01.268]  She's spending seven days in jail.
[00:45:01.288 --> 00:45:09.472]  Because unlike Walmart and Costco and CVS and Walgreens and Texaco, she's not essential.
[00:45:10.513 --> 00:45:11.253]  She's obsolete.
[00:45:13.356 --> 00:45:16.599]  And they're saying she's an evil person, but the general public says she's a hero.
[00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:20.423]  They're trying to reopen restaurants in Texas faster than the governor said.
[00:45:20.463 --> 00:45:21.284]  They're getting swatted.
[00:45:22.505 --> 00:45:24.627]  It's a shame that Texas has turned yellow.
[00:45:25.488 --> 00:45:29.873]  But we're a lot better than California, but not for long if the people don't start exercising their rights.
[00:45:31.854 --> 00:45:37.878]  You know, my businesses are deemed essential because I'm media, but I said, if they say it's not essential, I'm coming here.
[00:45:38.419 --> 00:45:39.460]  That's my line in the sand.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.643]  If somebody can say you're not essential, that's the power to kill your ass.
[00:45:44.363 --> 00:45:46.004]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:45:46.044 --> 00:45:49.467]  The power to say you're not essential and lock you down is the power to kill you.
[00:45:49.927 --> 00:45:53.270]  It's called siege to say you got to stay right there or I'll attack you.
[00:45:54.531 --> 00:45:56.152]  It's the most ancient form of total war.
[00:45:56.993 --> 00:45:59.935]  But at least Fox News was debating, is she good or is she bad?
[00:46:00.335 --> 00:46:01.636]  Everywhere else, she's the devil.
[00:46:02.397 --> 00:46:02.777]  Here it is.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:18.183]  A Dallas salon owner who gained national attention for defying stay-at-home orders is now spending a week in jail after she refused to apologize for reopening her business before coronavirus restrictions were lifted.
[00:46:18.823 --> 00:46:25.825]  Shelly Luther, who publicly ripped up a cease and desist letter last week, was given a choice by a judge.
[00:46:26.565 --> 00:46:35.830]  She could offer an apology for, quote, selfishness, pay a fine and shut down until Friday, or she could serve time in jail.
[00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:39.372]  But Luther defended her actions to the end.
[00:46:39.492 --> 00:46:39.852]  Listen.
[00:46:41.813 --> 00:46:47.996]  That your actions were selfish, putting your own interests ahead of those of the community in which you live.
[00:46:48.937 --> 00:46:52.619]  I have to disagree with you, sir, when you say that I'm selfish.
[00:46:53.592 --> 00:46:55.433]  Luther also has to pay a $7,000 fine.
[00:46:55.453 --> 00:46:58.496]  Brian, I'll start with you.
[00:46:58.516 --> 00:46:59.857]  Did the government go too far in this case?
[00:47:24.318 --> 00:47:24.979]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:47:24.999 --> 00:47:25.799]  There's no question.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.280]  You know, think about this.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:35.607]  In a time in which everyone's letting everybody out of prison, we're cracking down on a salon owner that wants to get open early while being socially distanced.
[00:47:35.927 --> 00:47:39.910]  There were lines on the floor, there were going to be lines outside, everyone wearing masks.
[00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:47.976]  She just wanted to go down swinging because, like major companies like Gold's Gym, which is now filing for bankruptcy, she did not want to go.
[00:47:48.016 --> 00:47:50.398]  She did not see an end in sight, so she opened up.
[00:47:50.778 --> 00:47:53.040]  She got a cease and desist letter.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.200]  Let's stop right there.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.041]  Absolutely.
[00:47:55.741 --> 00:47:57.561]  Again, working out is totally essential.
[00:47:57.661 --> 00:47:58.481]  Everything's essential.
[00:47:58.922 --> 00:48:02.563]  And the idea that if this was a super deadly virus, people should have the right to do what they want.
[00:48:02.583 --> 00:48:04.343]  If you want to stay indoors and starve to death, go ahead.
[00:48:04.643 --> 00:48:05.743]  If you don't, that's the way it is.
[00:48:06.164 --> 00:48:18.227]  But this idea Hollywood's drummed into our head with hundreds of movies and TV shows is we all just locked down and it's the end of the world and the judge is, you're selfish, I'm wearing my mask, I'm a good person, you're selfish, you're bad.
[00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:20.368]  Meanwhile, 135 million people are starving to death.
[00:48:23.885 --> 00:48:26.206]  Not even a half million have died worldwide from this.
[00:48:27.086 --> 00:48:31.068]  So again, it's all these virtue-signalers who suspend logic.
[00:48:32.008 --> 00:48:34.969]  Major insurance companies in South Africa have done the analysis.
[00:48:34.989 --> 00:48:41.572]  29 times more death caused already by starvation and collapse of society.
[00:48:41.612 --> 00:48:45.954]  And then now they estimate that for decades this will take years off people's lives.
[00:48:48.183 --> 00:48:49.724]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:49.964 --> 00:48:51.405]  It's up on Newswars.com.
[00:48:51.485 --> 00:48:53.407]  Only way the dog hunts is if you share it.
[00:48:53.447 --> 00:48:56.169]  We need to save Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
[00:48:56.229 --> 00:48:59.391]  And look, I care about those folks, but let me tell you who I really care about.
[00:48:59.872 --> 00:49:00.992]  All of us in America.
[00:49:02.734 --> 00:49:04.035]  We're collapsing the third world.
[00:49:04.935 --> 00:49:05.556]  They're dying.
[00:49:06.096 --> 00:49:07.377]  We're going to go down to that next.
[00:49:07.517 --> 00:49:10.459]  Gates is just getting them first because he's got them near death.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.701]  Now they're getting rid of our economy.
[00:49:13.161 --> 00:49:16.244]  It's what the big globalist corporations have done in these countries.
[00:49:17.466 --> 00:49:19.566]  And now they're going to get us in their jaws.
[00:49:19.746 --> 00:49:23.047]  Just remember, everything I tell you comes true, folks, because I do my damn homework.
[00:49:23.147 --> 00:49:23.727]  I live this.
[00:49:24.007 --> 00:49:24.607]  I dream this.
[00:49:24.687 --> 00:49:25.367]  I'm a machine.
[00:49:25.587 --> 00:49:26.348]  It's all I do.
[00:49:27.108 --> 00:49:30.688]  And finally, good news is starting to happen.
[00:49:30.748 --> 00:49:34.169]  You notice the Pentagon says we're at war with China and they're trying to arrest the Chinese spies.
[00:49:34.629 --> 00:49:36.229]  The Democratic Party is the fifth column.
[00:49:37.029 --> 00:49:38.530]  It's us or them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:43.871]  Paul Joseph Watson and others coming up, and he's loaded for bear.
[00:49:43.951 --> 00:49:45.231]  Spread the live links now.
[00:49:47.933 --> 00:49:52.254]  And we are live talking COVID-1984.
[00:49:52.334 --> 00:50:06.099]  The world continues to lurch towards the atomized dystopian prison planet that we've been mourning about for the past two decades with this coronavirus outbreak, the aftermath, the lockdown, the draconian control measures.
[00:50:06.119 --> 00:50:15.102]  I was thinking about the film Network earlier, you know, the one with the scene where he leans out the window or he encourages people to lean out the window and shout.
[00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:17.740]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:23.244]  Well, in the UK, we lean out of the window and we applaud Big Brother on a weekly basis.
[00:50:23.284 --> 00:50:27.387]  That will continue to happen, probably for the foreseeable future.
[00:50:28.087 --> 00:50:41.597]  Now we're being told, and I'm going to get into this article later, by the way, we've got Andrew Tait coming up in the second hour, in the next hour, going to cover an article about restaurants making diners eat in pods.
[00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:45.593]  Live in a pod, work in a pod, socialise in a pod.
[00:50:45.633 --> 00:50:54.177]  Because apparently, and this is a new one on me, after March 2020, humans suddenly stopped having immune systems.
[00:50:54.697 --> 00:50:57.278]  Now we've literally got to live our lives in the prison pod.
[00:50:57.959 --> 00:51:04.682]  Why doesn't the government just mandate everybody live in, you know, those zorbing balls and just live in a pod, the boy in the bubble.
[00:51:05.543 --> 00:51:06.083]  There was a film
[00:51:06.724 --> 00:51:15.471]  I think it was back in the 70s with John Travolta called The Boy in the Bubble where he basically has no immune system and he's forced to live life inside a giant pod.
[00:51:16.252 --> 00:51:18.233]  That's basically what we're being asked to do.
[00:51:18.814 --> 00:51:27.040]  With his mother and father having to cradle and hug him wearing these biological gloves that they shove through this pod just to have contact with their own son.
[00:51:28.361 --> 00:51:29.703]  That's what we're being told to do.
[00:51:29.723 --> 00:51:30.763]  I'm going to get into that later.
[00:51:31.064 --> 00:51:33.526]  What's going on in Airstrip 1 today though?
[00:51:33.986 --> 00:51:35.027]  Well of course last night
[00:51:36.044 --> 00:51:39.606]  We had John Travolta, the boy in the bubble.
[00:51:40.206 --> 00:51:46.069]  That film is not of the highest quality, but it definitely has echoes of our situation we're facing today.
[00:51:47.029 --> 00:51:48.630]  Professor Lockdown.
[00:51:49.710 --> 00:52:00.776]  This is the guy who created the model, the Imperial College model in the UK, which warned the government that if they didn't impose a lockdown and social distancing measures, 500,000 people in the UK would die.
[00:52:04.423 --> 00:52:27.701]  That model's been totally eviscerated, and then if you look at Sweden, which I'm also going to get into later, which of course didn't have a lockdown, their R rate, the rate of infection, is the same as the UK's, and their death rate per capita, if you compare their population to ours, inclusive of the obvious vast difference in population, their death rate was lower than the UK.
[00:52:27.861 --> 00:52:30.123]  They didn't lock down anything.
[00:52:31.284 --> 00:52:32.345]  What was the point?
[00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:38.029]  We were told we had to lock down to save lives and protect the NHS.
[00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:40.651]  The NHS was never overwhelmed.
[00:52:41.072 --> 00:52:45.416]  The hospital beds, the acute hospital beds, are four times emptier than normal.
[00:52:46.617 --> 00:52:54.225]  The Nightingale hospitals that they built to cope with the overflow, most of them are now either not going to open or being closed down already.
[00:52:55.137 --> 00:53:07.520]  You have the Professor of Cancer at King's College University London coming out and saying that excess cancer deaths, there'll be more excess cancer deaths than total coronavirus deaths in the UK over the next five years.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.680]  What was the point?
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:21.643]  Now Professor Lockdown, the brainchild behind all this, that Boris Johnson stupidly listened to, has been caught violating his own lockdown.
[00:53:22.668 --> 00:53:23.708]  Headline RT.
[00:53:24.229 --> 00:53:29.911]  Professor Lockdown Ferguson resigns after violating quarantine he designed to meet married lover.
[00:53:30.671 --> 00:53:43.816]  Professor Neil Ferguson, author of Apocalyptic Coronavirus Models, which was listened to by the government, has resigned from his position as advisor to 10 Downing Street after revelations he violated quarantine himself to meet with a married lover.
[00:53:44.556 --> 00:53:46.036]  The woman had two kids.
[00:53:46.717 --> 00:53:47.637]  She in fact complained.
[00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:48.777]  I'm going to get into that in a minute.
[00:53:49.778 --> 00:53:50.298]  What happened?
[00:53:51.147 --> 00:54:03.673]  Following Ferguson's resignation on Tuesday night, the Daily Telegraph made it public that the man known as Professor Lockdown, now known as Professor Pantsdown, had allowed a married mother with whom he was having an affair to visit him at least twice during the quarantine.
[00:54:03.693 --> 00:54:06.834]  The woman was identified as Antonia Stats, 38.
[00:54:09.275 --> 00:54:12.256]  And now there are jokes about him massaging the stats.
[00:54:12.757 --> 00:54:13.577]  The first visit
[00:54:14.502 --> 00:54:23.227]  It was reportedly on March 30th, as Ferguson warned the British public that lockdown measures, in effect for a week at that time, would have to remain in place until June.
[00:54:24.428 --> 00:54:32.573]  Boris Johnson's going to give a speech on Sunday, by the way, probably extending them another three weeks, despite the fact the peak of the virus was a month ago.
[00:54:33.354 --> 00:54:36.996]  He said, I accept I made an error of judgment and took the wrong course of action.
[00:54:37.955 --> 00:54:40.357]  Confirming that he's resigned from the Government's permission.
[00:54:40.638 --> 00:54:43.420]  But he maintained the call for a lockdown, of course.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.002]  He's not going to be subject to it.
[00:54:45.462 --> 00:54:53.129]  The Minister in Scotland, Scotland's Chief Medical Officer, she violated her own lockdown to visit her second home.
[00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.653]  It's one rule for them, one rule for everyone else.
[00:54:58.074 --> 00:55:01.557]  Though he's still calling for the lockdown to continue, even though he's wantonly violated.
[00:55:01.577 --> 00:55:03.159]  There's more detail to this, though.
[00:55:04.105 --> 00:55:10.747]  And in fact, there's an excellent website called lockdownsceptics.org, run by Toby Young of The Spectator.
[00:55:11.727 --> 00:55:24.590]  And he cites the comment of Professor Pantsdown Ferguson, who said, I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for at least two weeks after developing symptoms.
[00:55:25.211 --> 00:55:43.477]  Toby Young comments, so not only does Professor Lockdown think you do develop immunity after recovering from COVID-19, of course now they're trying to tell us that that doesn't happen, so they have yet another excuse to keep these ridiculous measures in place forever, but you don't even need to take an antibody test to prove it, which he didn't.
[00:55:44.438 --> 00:55:48.799]  If only all of us who think we've had it were free to act in the same way.
[00:55:49.259 --> 00:55:54.461]  Now if you look at the woman herself, 38-year-old Antonia Statz, mother of two, married,
[00:55:55.839 --> 00:56:01.860]  According to The Telegraph, she lives in a $1.9 million house in London and has, quote, an open marriage.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.101]  How's that working out for you?
[00:56:03.881 --> 00:56:10.082]  They dug up a podcast of her and she appeared on a podcast on March 31st, which is now being removed.
[00:56:11.522 --> 00:56:18.124]  24 hours after visiting Professor Pantsdown, in which she complains that the lockdown is putting a strain on her marriage.
[00:56:19.457 --> 00:56:25.985]  Yeah, maybe the fact you're having an affair with the architect of the lockdown is putting a strain on your marriage even more.
[00:56:26.005 --> 00:56:39.120]  And then you can look at her politics and it's a big coincidence that a lot of these people who are so vehemently for these draconian lockdown measures are, you guessed it, far leftists.
[00:56:39.918 --> 00:56:51.343]  The Telegraph has her down as a left-wing campaigner, a reference to the fact she campaigned against leaving the EU and is a long-standing environmental activist who supported Greta Thunberg's climate strike.
[00:56:51.724 --> 00:56:57.766]  So again, it's always the biggest virtue signalers who are the biggest hypocrites every single time.
[00:56:58.667 --> 00:57:04.149]  In fact, there's a picture of her delivering a petition to end fossil fuel subsidies to 10 Downing Street.
[00:57:06.741 --> 00:57:10.022]  And her politics are, as this article explains, far left.
[00:57:10.763 --> 00:57:14.764]  Even further to the left as compared to Professor Pantsdown himself.
[00:57:15.264 --> 00:57:27.849]  So the very architect of the lockdown program in the UK, the one that they said was necessary to save 500,000 lives, now other professors are saying that more people will die of cancer anyway,
[00:57:29.522 --> 00:57:35.225]  The guy, the head honcho behind the entire programme, violated his own lockdown.
[00:57:35.545 --> 00:57:44.409]  Absolutely incredible, but par for the course given what happened in Chicago there with the Mayor, and of course in Scotland with Scotland's Chief Medical Officer.
[00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:48.811]  Now, Boris Johnson is set to give a speech on Sunday, as I said.
[00:57:49.652 --> 00:57:58.196]  What's interesting about the lockdown in the UK is that the British population, like no other, has been terrified beyond belief.
[00:57:58.863 --> 00:58:09.971]  Terrorised by the necessity for this, despite obviously reaching the peak of coronavirus cases over a month ago, many of them want the lockdown to go on for months and months more.
[00:58:11.192 --> 00:58:11.913]  I know people
[00:58:12.682 --> 00:58:21.187]  Barmen, people who work jobs mainly based on tips, who are basically at this point completely bankrupt, they're out of jobs, they're losing their homes.
[00:58:21.588 --> 00:58:32.514]  But there's a big segment of the British population who are lazy and want to sit on their behinds for the next three, four months and collect the government paycheck.
[00:58:32.534 --> 00:58:34.716]  80% of their wages are covered by the government.
[00:58:35.236 --> 00:58:41.540]  So in no other country do you see support for lockdown than the UK, from all the polls that I've seen, to the point
[00:58:42.648 --> 00:58:44.509]  And I'm going to get into this more in the next segment.
[00:58:45.229 --> 00:58:54.052]  They asked people about the lockdown and 50, no in fact it was 60% in a poll said they wanted it to be more draconian.
[00:58:54.893 --> 00:59:02.416]  The only place basically in the United Kingdom that you're allowed to go is the supermarket and the parks.
[00:59:02.436 --> 00:59:08.358]  60% of people in this poll wanted the government to close down the parks so we wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere.
[00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.639]  I mean what has happened?
[00:59:11.747 --> 00:59:21.555]  This has been an experiment in mass obedience and the results have not come out too good if you believe in freedom of mobility and all that goes with it.
[00:59:21.575 --> 00:59:23.597]  We're going to get into that study in the next segment.
[00:59:24.017 --> 00:59:25.378]  Summit.news, don't go away.
[00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:31.783]  So it has really been an exercise in mass conformity if you look at it from the British perspective.
[00:59:33.004 --> 00:59:39.650]  And this whole social distancing thing, there's a new study or a Twitter thread by a doctor, Dr Mucevic,
[00:59:40.302 --> 00:59:42.383]  This again is on lockdownsceptics.org.
[00:59:42.923 --> 00:59:46.485]  She's an infectious disease researcher at St Andrews University.
[00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:57.570]  She, sorry, she cites numerous research studies suggesting that close and prolonged exposure to someone infected with the virus is necessary for transmission, making a nonsense of social distancing rules.
[00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:06.013]  So you have to be in close proximity with someone for an extended period of time to transmit this disease according to new research.
[01:00:06.434 --> 01:00:09.575]  So this whole thing about social distancing, which Dow's got to the point,
[01:00:10.464 --> 01:00:16.547]  Where they're talking about putting markers on the pavement, where you can't get close to somebody based on this marker.
[01:00:16.767 --> 01:00:24.611]  They've got facial recognition cameras in the works to tie your face into the social credit score that they're going to roll out, Chinese style.
[01:00:25.711 --> 01:00:27.292]  And again, what are the punishments going to be?
[01:00:27.692 --> 01:00:35.456]  Fines, a lowering of your social credit score, a revoke of your social media posting privileges perhaps.
[01:00:36.116 --> 01:00:37.317]  The article goes on to say,
[01:00:38.371 --> 01:00:47.477]  In terms of this social distancing being questioned, the most likely hotspots are not sporting arenas, shopping centres, restaurants, cafes, etc, but hospitals and care homes.
[01:00:48.258 --> 01:00:53.862]  The doctor said, quote, casual short interactions are not the main driver of the epidemic.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.861]  The technical way of putting this is that the virus is no social meal infection.
[01:00:59.961 --> 01:01:11.864]  Incidentally, this is another person, Matt Ridley's, reason for becoming a lockdown sceptic, because more and more of the science is saying that this social distancing that we've been doing for the past six weeks has no impact whatsoever.
[01:01:13.805 --> 01:01:14.305]  Meanwhile,
[01:01:15.552 --> 01:01:20.836]  Reuters reports, Dutch restaurant trials glass booths for dining amid coronavirus.
[01:01:21.296 --> 01:01:25.780]  Again, live in a pod, work in a pod, socialise in a pod, eat bugs.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:30.243]  A Dutch restaurant has come up with an idea on how to offer classy outdoor dining.
[01:01:31.144 --> 01:01:31.664]  Classy!
[01:01:32.384 --> 01:01:38.449]  In the age of coronavirus, small glass cabins built for two or three people, creating intimate cocoons on a public patio.
[01:01:39.016 --> 01:01:46.340]  Waiters wear gloves and transparent face shields and use longboard to bring dishes into the glass cabins to ensure minimal physical contact with customers.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:51.222]  They're talking about having to have a table between every diner.
[01:01:51.743 --> 01:01:54.404]  You know, immediately cut restaurant income in half.
[01:01:55.064 --> 01:01:57.946]  They're talking about putting pods around everyone when they get on an airplane.
[01:01:58.556 --> 01:02:06.363]  The boss of Heathrow came out yesterday, I'm going to get into this later, and said this social distancing in airports is not going to work!
[01:02:06.944 --> 01:02:15.512]  It's practically impossible to be two metres away from somebody when you're boarding a plane, unless you want the queue for the plane to stretch for a kilometre!
[01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.176]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:02:20.217 --> 01:02:23.580]  While the concept is currently being trialled only for family and friends of staff,
[01:02:24.642 --> 01:02:25.943]  It certainly looks glamorous.
[01:02:26.023 --> 01:02:26.583]  No, it doesn't.
[01:02:26.903 --> 01:02:29.725]  Having your dinner in a greenhouse is not glamorous.
[01:02:31.506 --> 01:02:32.667]  It's super cozy.
[01:02:32.807 --> 01:02:33.707]  It's really cozy.
[01:02:33.727 --> 01:02:34.187]  It's nice.
[01:02:34.227 --> 01:02:35.408]  And the food is delicious.
[01:02:36.469 --> 01:02:39.110]  Just making everyone a surf.
[01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:42.172]  Not only making them a surf, making it sound cozy.
[01:02:43.283 --> 01:02:44.444]  And people are terrified.
[01:02:44.504 --> 01:02:46.524]  People in the UK are still terrified.
[01:02:46.904 --> 01:02:50.286]  They want them to lock down parks.
[01:02:50.306 --> 01:02:55.228]  60% in a poll said this social distancing, this draconian lockdown, doesn't go far enough.
[01:02:56.648 --> 01:03:08.693]  The comedian Sam Hyde did a skit where he was like, stay at home, sit on a chair, go to your basement, sit on a chair, face the wall, don't look out the window and stay there for four to ten years.
[01:03:09.213 --> 01:03:12.875]  Some of these people in these polls would actually probably unironically support that.
[01:03:13.965 --> 01:03:20.526]  The only place British people are allowed to go, unless they're going to Tesco supermarket, is parks.
[01:03:21.067 --> 01:03:27.548]  So every weekend on a Saturday and a Sunday, the entire population of London is crammed into these parks.
[01:03:27.868 --> 01:03:29.568]  There's no social distancing.
[01:03:30.088 --> 01:03:37.610]  People are running, people are spitting as they run, they're spitting on the floor, they're breathing, they're running past you, you've got bikes, kids running around everywhere.
[01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:39.270]  There's no social distancing.
[01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:41.831]  They've crammed the entire population of the city.
[01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:45.380]  Into about eight major parks across the city.
[01:03:46.421 --> 01:03:46.901]  Insane!
[01:03:47.842 --> 01:03:53.306]  ITV reports Cambridge study finds Brits are most concerned about COVID-19 risk.
[01:03:53.986 --> 01:03:58.470]  Cambridge researchers have found that Brits are more worried about coronavirus than Italy, Spain or South Korea.
[01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:05.955]  It goes on to say studies carried out by University of Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence and it shows that basically
[01:04:06.678 --> 01:04:09.300]  British people are the most petrified.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.622]  Here's the poll I was talking about earlier, headline out of The Independent.
[01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:18.746]  Coronavirus British public backs tighter lockdown restrictions if needed to beat disease.
[01:04:19.626 --> 01:04:21.167]  This is a BMG survey.
[01:04:22.308 --> 01:04:25.149]  It said if there were indications that support will wane.
[01:04:25.169 --> 01:04:34.015]  It said that there were indications that support will wane, but then it says if the government came out and said that these lockdown measures will be extended into the summer,
[01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:38.412]  Only 41% said that would be unreasonable.
[01:04:40.732 --> 01:04:46.074]  41%, that means the majority, unless they've got an option for don't know, which is not specified in the article.
[01:04:47.054 --> 01:04:58.637]  The majority are happy for it to be extended to August and then only 48%, still a minority if you don't have a don't know answer, are happy for it to be extended into September.
[01:04:58.717 --> 01:05:00.497]  So another four months from now.
[01:05:01.118 --> 01:05:02.778]  Again, a lot of these people, if you said
[01:05:03.695 --> 01:05:10.758]  Stay at home for the next two years, they'd say yes, and they'd take their paycheck, and they'd lean out the window every Thursday at 8pm and clap, big brother.
[01:05:10.778 --> 01:05:22.082]  12%, one in eight of the population, said they believed a continuation of tight social distancing measures lasting nine months or more, stretching into 2021, would be reasonable.
[01:05:23.183 --> 01:05:26.604]  So over 10% of the population want this to go on for another year.
[01:05:27.464 --> 01:05:30.205]  Participants support the government's approach to COVID-19, 57% supported.
[01:05:33.807 --> 01:05:39.110]  64% said the government was right to prioritize saving lives at the risk of harming jobs.
[01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:45.554]  Yeah, the professor of cancer at King's College says there will be more excess cancer death than COVID deaths.
[01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:48.876]  That's not saving lives, that's costing lives.
[01:05:49.857 --> 01:05:55.000]  You've got cancer patients who can't get screenings, who can't get treatment, can't get chemotherapy.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.641]  Thousands will die.
[01:05:57.801 --> 01:05:59.422]  Already have in many cases.
[01:05:59.442 --> 01:06:02.024]  Some of these numbers of the daily fatalities.
[01:06:03.115 --> 01:06:05.496]  Include people who can't get treatment for cancer.
[01:06:05.516 --> 01:06:09.396]  27% said the UK was well prepared for an outbreak.
[01:06:10.197 --> 01:06:11.177]  52% said it was not.
[01:06:12.477 --> 01:06:14.898]  Here's the stat.
[01:06:14.918 --> 01:06:17.178]  46% said they were not stringent enough.
[01:06:17.338 --> 01:06:19.799]  Opposition to the restrictions are strongest amongst the young.
[01:06:20.399 --> 01:06:26.000]  And then it says, with controversy raging over police officers' efforts to prevent sunbathing, God forbid.
[01:06:27.927 --> 01:06:34.750]  60% said they would back the closure of all parks if people continue to ignore social distancing rules.
[01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:41.513]  60% want the government to close down the only place that you're basically allowed to go apart from food shopping.
[01:06:42.194 --> 01:06:43.554]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:06:43.934 --> 01:06:50.778]  They've taped off park benches, not even park benches, benches in the streets in residential areas.
[01:06:51.158 --> 01:06:53.219]  They've taped them off with police tape.
[01:06:54.372 --> 01:06:56.293]  That's going to stop coronavirus, isn't it?
[01:06:56.773 --> 01:07:04.535]  Can you imagine you're some elderly person who's going out for their government allotted one hour daily exercise for a walk.
[01:07:05.495 --> 01:07:09.177]  Suddenly you get some chest pains or something, maybe you've got an ailment.
[01:07:09.717 --> 01:07:10.477]  You want to sit down?
[01:07:10.497 --> 01:07:13.018]  No, you can't, because that's going to stop COVID-19.
[01:07:13.258 --> 01:07:16.099]  Putting two bits of tape over a frigging park bench.
[01:07:18.699 --> 01:07:19.500]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.380]  There's an article by
[01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.232]  Michael Snyder which I'm going to get into after the break.
[01:07:24.312 --> 01:07:36.175]  I want to make social distancing a permanent part of our lives because again it's about the enforcement of absurd petty rules on a whim that they can reintroduce at any point.
[01:07:36.855 --> 01:07:47.557]  They say jump, you say how high and given how the polls are looking out the UK a lot of people are perfectly happy to continue jumping in lockstep with the government.
[01:07:48.154 --> 01:07:55.279]  Gonna get into that and more how Sweden has responded to the coronavirus and why it's so different to the rest of the world and why it's actually working.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.301]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[01:07:57.561 --> 01:07:58.441]  Summit.News.
[01:08:00.203 --> 01:08:15.494]  The creator, the writer of Black Mirror, which if you haven't seen it is a dystopian sci-fi TV series, we're gonna get into this later, has announced that he stopped writing the new series of Black Mirror because the real world is more dystopian than his television program.
[01:08:17.463 --> 01:08:18.364]  This is where we're at.
[01:08:18.664 --> 01:08:24.027]  There's a Michael Snyder article called They Want to Make Social Distancing a Permanent Part of Their Lives.
[01:08:25.048 --> 01:08:34.093]  He talks about this, they're talking about putting physical markings on sidewalks, this is out of the Daily Mail, in order to constantly remind us all not to walk too closely to one another.
[01:08:35.314 --> 01:08:36.975]  About 15 years ago in the UK,
[01:08:38.394 --> 01:08:46.421]  Everybody suddenly started noticing the emergence of people wearing high-vis jackets, barking orders at everyone and telling them what to do.
[01:08:46.441 --> 01:08:53.807]  I'm not talking about people who wear high-vis jackets for, you know, if they're working on construction sites, they're doing something potentially dangerous.
[01:08:53.867 --> 01:08:57.170]  I'm talking about just enforcers within society.
[01:08:57.531 --> 01:09:00.153]  So this high-vis jacket became the kind of emblem
[01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:06.638]  The kind of motif of these new enforcers on top of the police that were barking orders telling everyone what to do.
[01:09:07.038 --> 01:09:09.038]  Now the police wear those high-vis jackets.
[01:09:09.939 --> 01:09:12.099]  British police used to dress well.
[01:09:12.139 --> 01:09:16.081]  They used to dress in a way which would attract Ghana respect.
[01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:20.082]  Now they all look like these same petty high-vis enforcers.
[01:09:20.522 --> 01:09:21.702]  They don't get respected.
[01:09:22.002 --> 01:09:27.084]  As you noted, as we reported, in many migrant areas of major cities in Europe,
[01:09:27.901 --> 01:09:32.063]  These lockdown measures, these social distancing measures are being completely ignored.
[01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:43.787]  In fact, in France, the Interior Minister even said we shouldn't enforce legally these social distancing measures in certain migrant ghetto areas because it could lead to riots.
[01:09:44.628 --> 01:09:49.770]  So again, the people crafting the policies aren't following the policies or violating the policies.
[01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:55.553]  People in certain areas of society, certain areas of cities, are protected.
[01:09:55.633 --> 01:09:58.454]  They don't have to follow the policies, only you, only the plebs.
[01:09:59.874 --> 01:10:05.757]  They're talking about arrows on the ground and other physical markers to encourage and enforce distance.
[01:10:06.317 --> 01:10:13.420]  Imagine sidewalks with scoring every six feet so those walking could make sure they're the human equivalent of a few car lengths behind.
[01:10:14.156 --> 01:10:16.918]  Or large sculptures deployed to separate people.
[01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:25.626]  Can you imagine the cost involved in putting markers on pavements on sidewalks every six feet around the entire country?
[01:10:26.666 --> 01:10:28.328]  What a pointless waste of money.
[01:10:29.489 --> 01:10:35.274]  And, again, the proliferation of signs of street furniture.
[01:10:35.714 --> 01:10:39.157]  Signs barking orders telling you what you can and can't do.
[01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:46.342]  You look at any high street 40, 50 years ago, there were hardly any signs telling people what to do whatsoever.
[01:10:46.362 --> 01:11:00.690]  I'm not just talking about traffic signs, I'm talking about, you know, creating this pod planet prison society where you're told how to behave, how to walk, how to behave around other people every two minutes everywhere you look.
[01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:03.051]  Walmart and other major retailers
[01:11:04.170 --> 01:11:10.571]  Are already starting to put arrows on the floors to remind us which direction to shop so that we can maintain proper social distancing.
[01:11:11.371 --> 01:11:26.394]  I saw in a supermarket the other day on Instagram a video of barriers that would normally be used for road traffic repairs inside supermarkets telling people you can't walk this way down this aisle.
[01:11:26.934 --> 01:11:28.514]  The aisle wasn't even blocked off.
[01:11:28.834 --> 01:11:31.135]  You could only approach it from the opposite side.
[01:11:31.615 --> 01:11:33.255]  Again, completely pointless.
[01:11:34.221 --> 01:11:44.370]  It's absolute madness, especially as I mentioned earlier with these new studies suggesting that to catch it, to transmit the virus, you have to live in very close proximity for an extended period of time.
[01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:46.232]  So none of this matters anyway.
[01:11:47.994 --> 01:11:48.954]  Article continues.
[01:11:49.955 --> 01:12:00.585]  We are being told that restaurants may have to start putting empty tables between customers, sports stadiums may have to keep at least half their seats empty, and churches may have to start holding services in shifts.
[01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:07.385]  Again, in terms of restaurants, sports stadiums, businesses, literally just lopping off half of their income immediately.
[01:12:07.425 --> 01:12:09.686]  That's really going to get the economy going again, isn't it?
[01:12:10.646 --> 01:12:15.867]  Just like in the days after 9-11, we will be told that the changes are just temporary measures.
[01:12:16.348 --> 01:12:20.809]  Once we accept temporary measures long enough, they have a way of becoming permanent.
[01:12:21.389 --> 01:12:22.529]  Again, that's the whole point, isn't it?
[01:12:22.909 --> 01:12:30.531]  We were told we had to go through this for a period of about six weeks, maybe two months, to get back to normal.
[01:12:31.178 --> 01:12:37.243]  Then about three weeks ago they suddenly said, oh no, you're never going to get back to normal, this is the new normal.
[01:12:37.864 --> 01:12:41.607]  Why did we do all that in the first place then, if that was your plan all along?
[01:12:43.409 --> 01:12:55.760]  The new normal is living in a pod, working in a pod, dining in a pod, and following these bizarre social distancing measures that the new studies suggest are completely pointless.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:56.821]  In the UK,
[01:12:58.365 --> 01:13:02.787]  Headline, 18 million people entered the UK as the coronavirus pandemic was raging.
[01:13:02.807 --> 01:13:12.652]  18 million people entered the UK in the three months before lockdown, with hardly any of them undergoing health screenings or being put into quarantine.
[01:13:12.672 --> 01:13:21.916]  100,000 people from foreign countries are arriving at UK airports still, to this day, every single week.
[01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:28.938]  You're not even allowed to drive to the airport unless, you know, you're an essential worker or you've got an essential reason to be there.
[01:13:29.398 --> 01:13:34.503]  But 100,000 people are arriving every single week with no health checks whatsoever.
[01:13:34.903 --> 01:13:45.952]  Boat migrants, I'm going to get into this in a minute, arriving on the coast in greater numbers than before the lockdown in some areas, getting taxi services from the government to bring them in.
[01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:52.833]  Meanwhile, they're talking about, oh, maybe we can go outside and have a picnic in a month.
[01:13:55.275 --> 01:14:03.899]  The Mirror reports only 273 people out of 18.1 million who came to the country in three months leading up to the nationwide lockdown were put into quarantine.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:13.845]  This means that tens of thousands of people were entering from coronavirus-affected countries, including Italy and Spain, and were then allowed to circulate amongst the general population.
[01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.691]  Now, a Labour MP called Stephen Doherty questioned this.
[01:14:18.771 --> 01:14:22.412]  Actually, some of the Labour politicians have been good in questioning the government on this.
[01:14:23.032 --> 01:14:24.393]  Gotta give them a little bit of credit.
[01:14:24.433 --> 01:14:32.855]  He said, on what scientific basis were a handful of flights from Wuhan and one from Tokyo singled out for extreme attention?
[01:14:32.895 --> 01:14:35.896]  Because those are the only flights where they actually held screened passengers.
[01:14:36.616 --> 01:14:40.397]  He said, not a single flight from Northern Italy, Spain or the US.
[01:14:41.127 --> 01:14:54.316]  The fact that many of these people then likely arrived and travelled onwards across the UK with little or no adherence to social distancing and with no checks or protections at the border, barely a whiff of hand sanitiser, is deeply disturbing.
[01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:59.880]  Let alone the arrival of 3,000 fans from Madrid as the pandemic picked up speed.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:07.505]  That's right, they had 3,000 football fans from Madrid arrive in the UK to attend a football match.
[01:15:08.248 --> 01:15:12.932]  Days before this lockdown was put into place, while coronavirus was raging in Spain.
[01:15:13.292 --> 01:15:13.952]  Come on in!
[01:15:14.953 --> 01:15:16.234]  No checks whatsoever.
[01:15:18.015 --> 01:15:24.781]  Meanwhile, Brits who have been put under government-imposed lockdown for six weeks are being told they might be allowed to go outside for picnics in a month.
[01:15:25.301 --> 01:15:26.742]  Thank you, Boris Johnson.
[01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:28.924]  Breitbart reports.
[01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:35.598]  Farage's defiant police visit won't deter Brexit leader from covering illegal immigration scandal.
[01:15:36.118 --> 01:15:49.181]  Nigel Farage has been visiting the coast in Kent, reporting on these illegal boat migrant arrivals, reporting on the fact that the UK border force, while we're all locked down, is acting as a taxi service to bring these migrants in.
[01:15:49.582 --> 01:15:51.782]  Again, potentially infected with coronavirus.
[01:15:52.803 --> 01:15:54.663]  He got visited by the police!
[01:15:55.263 --> 01:15:57.564]  No doubt because everyone on Twitter snitched on him.
[01:15:58.286 --> 01:16:04.729]  Nigel Farage struck a defiant tone after being informed by police that reporting on the illegal boat migrants was not essential travel.
[01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:10.853]  Well, it is essential because under the government's rules, the media is essential.
[01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:15.915]  You can go to work if you're in the media or a journalist because you're an essential worker.
[01:16:16.296 --> 01:16:21.018]  Nigel Farage has a column in one of the biggest newspapers in the United Kingdom.
[01:16:21.438 --> 01:16:26.341]  Nigel Farage is a radio host on one of the biggest radio stations in the United Kingdom.
[01:16:26.986 --> 01:16:28.066]  He is a reporter!
[01:16:29.107 --> 01:16:32.948]  He is an essential worker, so yes, of course, he can cover this under the rules.
[01:16:33.868 --> 01:16:42.371]  He said he'll continue to cover the scandal, despite the police warnings and criticism from the sneerocracy in the mainstream media.
[01:16:43.252 --> 01:16:49.053]  Meanwhile, Breitbart also reports London's NHS Field Hospital to be closed after barely being used.
[01:16:50.214 --> 01:16:53.375]  The 4,000-bed hospital, NHS Nightingale London,
[01:16:54.036 --> 01:16:59.980]  The jewel in the crown of the government's emergency coronavirus planning will be placed on standby from next week.
[01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:04.984]  They use the term placed on standby which makes it sound as if it's about to be opened.
[01:17:05.024 --> 01:17:05.424]  It isn't.
[01:17:05.564 --> 01:17:06.925]  It's about to be closed.
[01:17:07.986 --> 01:17:11.628]  Absolute 180 in terms of Orwellian news speed.
[01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:16.712]  But again it goes to the point, these overflow hospitals that they built because they said the NHS would be overwhelmed.
[01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:19.371]  Most of them haven't even been used.
[01:17:19.471 --> 01:17:21.232]  Many of them are now being closed down.
[01:17:21.592 --> 01:17:26.875]  The acute hospital beds across the United Kingdom are four times emptier than normal.
[01:17:27.356 --> 01:17:32.158]  We were lied to, but now we're told that we have to undergo this for three more weeks.
[01:17:32.218 --> 01:17:32.799]  Don't go away.
[01:17:32.979 --> 01:17:33.959]  Summit.News will be back.
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:39.082]  Now I was somebody who, from the beginning, took this coronavirus very seriously.
[01:17:39.402 --> 01:17:42.324]  I'm not arguing that it's a hoax, that it's a fake disease.
[01:17:42.364 --> 01:17:43.845]  It's a very serious disease, but
[01:17:44.901 --> 01:17:48.042]  I was the one at the beginning, as were many others, saying that this was a big threat.
[01:17:48.242 --> 01:17:54.784]  It was coming from China, where it originated, and that countries in the West needed to take this more seriously.
[01:17:54.824 --> 01:18:07.127]  This was back in January, when the World Health Organization was amplifying Chinese state media propaganda, telling people on January 14th there was no human-to-human transmission of COVID-19.
[01:18:08.547 --> 01:18:18.635]  I was warning Western country, as were many other people at the time, that they needed to take strong action in terms of border control measures, which never happened until it was too late.
[01:18:19.596 --> 01:18:26.802]  You know, this was during the time when people like de Blasio and Nancy Pelosi were out telling people to congregate in huge crowds in Chinatown.
[01:18:27.642 --> 01:18:37.130]  But now we're the ones who are to blame for apparently downplaying this, when in fact we were the ones warning about it from the start, and that it did need to be taken seriously.
[01:18:37.825 --> 01:18:48.871]  I was generally supportive of the UK government's lockdown measures given that it would be for a limited amount of time and that the entire purpose was to get back to normal.
[01:18:48.931 --> 01:18:51.393]  Now we're being told we will never get back to normal.
[01:18:52.914 --> 01:18:55.235]  An interesting phenomenon of course during this whole thing is
[01:18:56.388 --> 01:18:59.870]  The exploitation of it for more social media censorship.
[01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:01.211]  We have an article here.
[01:19:01.632 --> 01:19:06.595]  Headline, cell phone towers in Canada are being set on fire over 5G conspiracy theories.
[01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:09.497]  This has also happened in the UK and other countries, of course.
[01:19:10.758 --> 01:19:15.521]  Says there have been long-standing concerns about the radio waves that are being emitted by devices, especially from cell phones.
[01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:22.826]  However, it seems these concerns have been amplified with the launch of 5G, where there have been conspiracy theories linking 5G to various health issues.
[01:19:23.777 --> 01:19:28.982]  It goes on to talk about instances in Canada where 5G towers have been vandalized and set on fire.
[01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:47.818]  Now the way the media has reported this again, they argue that they need to delete, relegate, and the algorithm on social media, harmful conspiracy theories, and then promote in the algorithm, game, rig their own algorithm to promote authoritative sources.
[01:19:48.178 --> 01:19:51.001]  Problem is, nobody thinks the media is authoritative.
[01:19:51.815 --> 01:19:57.117]  Trust in media has plummeted even lower since this coronavirus pandemic started.
[01:19:58.198 --> 01:20:13.784]  There's this weird kind of thing where the more the media talks about 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories, the more it tries to squash them in terms of deleting information from social media platforms, the more people tend to believe them.
[01:20:14.564 --> 01:20:18.626]  Because the media is so discredited that when it becomes so aggressive,
[01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.399]  Trying to debunk conspiracy theories.
[01:20:21.819 --> 01:20:24.961]  And I don't believe there's any link between 5G and coronavirus.
[01:20:25.001 --> 01:20:26.261]  I haven't seen any evidence for it.
[01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:35.826]  But when the media is so aggressive in trying to debunk these conspiracy theories, in a way it actually makes people believe them more because they don't trust the media.
[01:20:36.906 --> 01:20:40.508]  And in fact there was a clip, which is in one of my recent videos,
[01:20:41.351 --> 01:20:48.777]  Where I covered how a local news station covered the COVID-19 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory.
[01:20:48.797 --> 01:20:50.979]  I'm going to play this clip right now and talk about it.
[01:20:51.019 --> 01:20:51.399]  Here it is.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.362]  And what about them 5G towers?
[01:20:54.962 --> 01:21:00.567]  These 5G towers have absolutely nothing to do with the spread of the coronavirus.
[01:21:00.607 --> 01:21:05.031]  Yeah, well the fact that anyone would believe this theory is absolutely mind-blowing.
[01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:09.875]  I agree with you that the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory is probably b****d.
[01:21:10.535 --> 01:21:18.737]  But the sheer inauthenticity of the way you speak with this ridiculous, contrived intonation is absolutely mind-blowing!
[01:21:18.857 --> 01:21:27.060]  An ally to chronic levels of distrust in the mainstream media would actually make people believe the conspiracy theory even more!
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.480]  There is no link.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:29.000]  None.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.121]  It is just completely false.
[01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:31.901]  Sure, Jan.
[01:21:35.723 --> 01:21:40.048]  So they present it with this guy who's putting on a completely fake accent.
[01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:42.610]  Obviously, that's not how he talks in real life.
[01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:48.557]  And this is a common thing, of course, across mainstream media, especially those kind of local TV news channels.
[01:21:48.977 --> 01:21:52.121]  Well, they put on this overemphasized fake intonation.
[01:21:52.821 --> 01:21:55.224]  And then they tell you there's no conspiracy theory.
[01:21:56.169 --> 01:21:58.150]  Without telling you why, it's wrong!
[01:21:58.170 --> 01:22:00.591]  Like, there's literally zero detail.
[01:22:00.611 --> 01:22:02.852]  They could have put in, like, a 30-second explainer.
[01:22:03.152 --> 01:22:03.812]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:22:03.832 --> 01:22:04.592]  This is why it's wrong.
[01:22:04.612 --> 01:22:05.453]  This is why it's stupid.
[01:22:05.513 --> 01:22:05.693]  No.
[01:22:06.093 --> 01:22:11.775]  They think that just by having a guy talk like this on a mainstream news station debunks it.
[01:22:11.795 --> 01:22:12.995]  It doesn't!
[01:22:13.516 --> 01:22:16.397]  It makes people look at it and think, that's weird.
[01:22:16.677 --> 01:22:18.737]  First of all, why is he talking like that?
[01:22:18.757 --> 01:22:19.438]  That's bizarre.
[01:22:19.478 --> 01:22:20.538]  Nobody talks like that.
[01:22:21.158 --> 01:22:25.400]  Then he's debunking the conspiracy theory without offering any information as to why it's wrong.
[01:22:26.164 --> 01:22:31.166]  Just because he's a guy in front of a camera on a mainstream news station, they think that's enough.
[01:22:31.726 --> 01:22:32.606]  It's not enough!
[01:22:33.466 --> 01:22:34.667]  Then they put up a doctor.
[01:22:35.567 --> 01:22:37.288]  Oh look, he's wearing a white lab coat.
[01:22:37.368 --> 01:22:38.148]  He must be right.
[01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:43.310]  Again, he doesn't even give in any information as to why the conspiracy theories debunked.
[01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:45.050]  That's not a debunking.
[01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:48.792]  It's just, look at us, we're the authorities, this is wrong.
[01:22:49.052 --> 01:22:49.612]  Go to sleep.
[01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.192]  That's weird!
[01:22:51.913 --> 01:22:55.654]  If you want to debunk conspiracy theories, I would argue, don't even talk about them.
[01:22:56.286 --> 01:22:58.187]  Or at least explain why they're silly.
[01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:05.791]  Don't just put up some weird guy talking in a fake accent or some doctor in a lab coat saying next to nothing.
[01:23:06.271 --> 01:23:07.612]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:23:08.232 --> 01:23:11.214]  Article in relation to that out of the Telegraph.
[01:23:11.966 --> 01:23:15.448]  Twitter steps up its fight against 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories.
[01:23:15.488 --> 01:23:22.952]  Twitter will begin prompting people who tweet about 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories to read British government verified information.
[01:23:23.412 --> 01:23:35.498]  Yes, I'm sure that somebody who believes in 5G conspiracy tower theories will read a document from the British government about it when they just want to tweet something.
[01:23:35.538 --> 01:23:37.439]  It's going to make them believe it even more.
[01:23:37.459 --> 01:23:41.381]  They're going to look at it and think, oh, the government's trying to cover this up by the looks of it.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.121]  It'd be better to just ignore it entirely.
[01:23:44.141 --> 01:23:52.583]  The theory, which is spread on social media, has resulted in attacks on mobile, telecom, maths and abuse directed at engineers in Britain.
[01:23:53.183 --> 01:23:56.224]  Scientists, phone companies and the government have said it's completely untrue.
[01:23:56.644 --> 01:24:10.548]  Twitter said the search prompt would inform users that the government had seen no link between 5G and COVID-19, include a link to a government website, which is like a, probably like a 10-page terms of service thing, the kind that nobody reads anyway.
[01:24:11.934 --> 01:24:22.918]  Katie Minshall, Twitter's UK Head of Government, Public Policy and Philanthropy, said the move was the latest step and it's focused on connecting people with authoritative information regarding Covid-19.
[01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:25.539]  Again, not going to work.
[01:24:26.039 --> 01:24:26.580]  Not going to work.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.700]  People aren't going to read it.
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.622]  When they try and suppress information, it makes people believe it's true.
[01:24:34.323 --> 01:24:40.585]  Absolutely incredible that they haven't grasped this yet, especially with chronic levels of distrust in the mainstream media.
[01:24:41.638 --> 01:24:47.043]  Bright Bar also reports, Twitter will now warn you if you're about to post wrongthink.
[01:24:47.903 --> 01:24:50.485]  Are you about to post a tweet containing harmful language?
[01:24:50.565 --> 01:24:57.191]  Don't worry, Twitter is experimenting with a feature that will warn you ahead of time so you don't accidentally infect any users with your wrongthink.
[01:24:57.771 --> 01:25:02.715]  When things get heated, you may say things you don't mean, wrote Twitter's official support account in a tweet yesterday.
[01:25:03.376 --> 01:25:06.739]  To let you rethink a reply, we're running a limited experiment with a prompt.
[01:25:07.344 --> 01:25:12.668]  It gives you the option to revise your reply before it's published if it uses language that could be harmful.
[01:25:13.828 --> 01:25:16.870]  Doesn't really specify what harmful language is.
[01:25:17.651 --> 01:25:26.336]  No doubt that will be extended to include expressing harmful opinions, which of course is anything that goes against the government at this stage.
[01:25:26.396 --> 01:25:28.458]  That's what this has been exploited to achieve.
[01:25:28.978 --> 01:25:31.720]  Creating a new standard for social media censorship.
[01:25:32.262 --> 01:25:36.084]  Where criticizing authority is against the terms of service.
[01:25:36.585 --> 01:25:38.766]  Literally, that's what YouTube has in place now.
[01:25:39.406 --> 01:25:45.410]  Literally deleting one and a half hour presentations from licensed medical doctors.
[01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:47.211]  Because that's wrong-think.
[01:25:48.651 --> 01:25:50.633]  Article says it's a bit like pre-crime.
[01:25:51.593 --> 01:26:01.919]  In the 2002 Tom Cruise film Minority Report, Twitter will notice when you're about to use a bad word, giving you the chance to avoid a rule violation and save your account from the digital gulag.
[01:26:03.294 --> 01:26:10.740]  Because we're trying to encourage people to rethink their behaviour and rethink their language before posting because they often, in the heat of the moment, they might say something they regret.
[01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:13.022]  Meanwhile, still no edit button.
[01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:23.852]  Still, on Twitter, the digital hate mobs are allowed to engage in targeted cyber bullying, doxing and harassment of children.
[01:26:23.892 --> 01:26:25.713]  I made a video about this yesterday.
[01:26:26.774 --> 01:26:27.695]  What's happening is
[01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:44.968]  These radical left-wing identitarian hate mobs are going on to TikTok, finding edgy TikTok videos, offensive TikTok videos uploaded by teenagers, posting them to Twitter with the tag, Twitter do your thing.
[01:26:45.638 --> 01:26:59.586]  Twitter do your thing is a dog whistle for thousands of other people, in some cases tens of thousands, to locate the personal information, work addresses, school locations, home addresses, members of their family.
[01:26:59.606 --> 01:27:01.768]  I'm talking about 15 year old kids.
[01:27:02.495 --> 01:27:10.299]  To then dox, harass, cyberbully, call up schools, call up employment offices, threaten people.
[01:27:10.599 --> 01:27:15.562]  Twitter is allowing this on an industrial scale on a daily basis.
[01:27:15.662 --> 01:27:18.003]  They do nothing whatsoever to stop it.
[01:27:18.764 --> 01:27:23.486]  Oh, but if you're going to tweet the F word, they're going to put up a prompt telling you not to do it.
[01:27:23.826 --> 01:27:25.387]  That's not the real problem, is it?
[01:27:26.388 --> 01:27:26.728]  In fact,
[01:27:27.648 --> 01:27:36.274]  I think it was last year when Twitter instituted a rule whereby people were getting their accounts banned if they tweeted hashtag learn to code at journalists.
[01:27:36.994 --> 01:27:41.898]  Tweeting learn to code at journalists, that was classified as harassment and abuse.
[01:27:42.358 --> 01:27:52.505]  But the industrial scale harassment, doxing and cyber bullying of minors by these unruly, insane crazed digital hate mobs which have now found a home on Twitter
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.203]  Apparently that's perfectly fine and they're not going to do anything to stop it.
[01:27:57.263 --> 01:27:57.883]  Don't go away.
[01:27:58.263 --> 01:27:59.664]  Summit.News, we'll be right back.
[01:28:01.245 --> 01:28:08.530]  Now there's no doubt that nurses, doctors have been weaponised for partisan political purposes amidst this coronavirus outbreak.
[01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:13.193]  Of course we had widespread media coverage a few weeks ago of these nurses standing in front of
[01:28:13.829 --> 01:28:16.170]  Anti-lockdown protesters holding signs.
[01:28:16.230 --> 01:28:25.733]  The media portrayed it as if these protesters, or the nurses, I'm sorry, were blocking the traffic, blocking the protesters, preventing them from driving in their vehicles.
[01:28:26.154 --> 01:28:29.435]  When you actually saw the videos of that, it was nothing like that.
[01:28:29.515 --> 01:28:30.395]  It was a photo op.
[01:28:30.435 --> 01:28:34.357]  They literally would stand in front of the vehicle for five seconds with the sign.
[01:28:34.837 --> 01:28:36.978]  The guy would take the picture, then they'd walk off.
[01:28:37.038 --> 01:28:39.098]  It was nothing like it was presented by the media.
[01:28:39.438 --> 01:28:40.639]  Well, now Project Veritas
[01:28:42.213 --> 01:28:55.482]  We have yet another example of media fakery as it relates to this outbreak and here's the clip that they put out on Twitter earlier today.
[01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:02.951]  I understand, absolutely.
[01:29:22.389 --> 01:29:28.874]  Only six states have reported more cases than Michigan, but fewer than 2% of its people have been tested for the virus.
[01:29:29.474 --> 01:29:37.540]  In our series on the state of coronavirus testing, Adriana Diaz shows how Michigan is trying to improve a system that has failed some of its people.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.784]  But the governor says testing above all else will help determine when to fully reopen.
[01:29:43.164 --> 01:29:48.028]  Apparently, the news crew wanted
[01:29:49.873 --> 01:29:55.538]  Did she tell you guys, like, hey, you're not actually getting tested?
[01:29:55.658 --> 01:29:55.898]  Yeah.
[01:29:55.958 --> 01:29:56.459]  Oh, okay.
[01:29:56.519 --> 01:29:57.540]  Yeah, she did.
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:00.322]  Just to make it look easy.
[01:30:13.989 --> 01:30:14.550]  That's crazy.
[01:30:14.630 --> 01:30:16.351]  Is this the fake line?
[01:30:16.371 --> 01:30:18.953]  So the people in the cars are not patients?
[01:30:39.727 --> 01:30:40.547]  Majority of them.
[01:30:40.627 --> 01:30:54.033]  I do know from talking to the testers that one of them, one or two of them were real patients which added to their frustration because this line sat there for a while so they could organize the shot.
[01:30:58.627 --> 01:31:01.289]  With medical personnel on the cars as opposed to patients?
[01:31:01.709 --> 01:31:01.929]  Correct.
[01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:03.370]  And the viewer does not know that?
[01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:04.110]  Correct.
[01:31:04.371 --> 01:31:09.874]  You shouldn't be afraid to say the truth, because in the end, you know, truth always wins.
[01:31:12.496 --> 01:31:21.421]  So obviously the narrative here that they're trying to spin, of course, is that the Trump administration is not keeping up with demand for testing for coronavirus, that they can't meet demand, that they're incompetent.
[01:31:22.088 --> 01:31:27.051]  So they literally stage a scene where they have multiple people trying to get tested for coronavirus.
[01:31:27.491 --> 01:31:34.995]  Only two of the people in that line were actually being tested and the rest were plants put there by CBS News.
[01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:40.018]  And now they've had to admit that today in light of this Project Veritas expose.
[01:31:40.058 --> 01:31:43.080]  Of course we also had CNN's Chris Cuomo.
[01:31:44.141 --> 01:31:49.684]  Headline CNN's Chris Cuomo emergence from basement compared to infamous Brian Williams Iraq moment.
[01:31:50.825 --> 01:32:00.699]  Where he made a big song and dance, because he's an incessant drama queen, about emerging from his basement having self-isolated due to catching coronavirus.
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.403]  Turns out of course as Fox News reports he was
[01:32:03.999 --> 01:32:17.209]  Previously involved in a heated altercation that took place outside his second property in a completely different area of the Hamptons over the Easter weekend where he had a fight with a bicyclist who filed a police complaint.
[01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:23.574]  So he claimed that he was emerging from his Corona basement and that it was the first time he'd come out of the basement.
[01:32:23.995 --> 01:32:25.436]  CNN broadcast this.
[01:32:26.036 --> 01:32:32.261]  It was then pointed out he'd been outside arguing with people, as he loves to do, a week before that.
[01:32:32.918 --> 01:32:38.261]  So he's completely staged the idea that this was the first time he was emerging from his basement.
[01:32:38.281 --> 01:32:42.323]  Yet another example of media staging when it comes to this coronavirus outbreak.
[01:32:43.463 --> 01:32:44.504]  I'm going to wrap it up for now.
[01:32:44.584 --> 01:32:45.204]  Don't go away.
[01:32:45.224 --> 01:32:48.106]  We'll be right back with our guest Andrew Tait on the other side.
[01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:48.786]  Summit.News.
[01:32:48.926 --> 01:32:49.586]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:50.647 --> 01:32:55.990]  And we are back talking about this virus which seems to be circulating the world over the past few months.
[01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:57.030]  You've probably heard about it.
[01:32:57.470 --> 01:33:00.212]  Had an article up on Summit.News a couple of days ago.
[01:33:01.249 --> 01:33:09.134]  Again, in context of social distancing, Heathrow boss says social distancing will never work at airports.
[01:33:09.274 --> 01:33:17.939]  Heathrow boss John Holland Kay warns that social distancing measures would never work at airports because queues to board flights would be a kilometre long.
[01:33:18.799 --> 01:33:20.320]  They're expecting us to go through this.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:28.325]  I talked about them putting markings on the pavement, on the sidewalk earlier, as if anyone's going to abide by that, especially in crowded cities.
[01:33:28.685 --> 01:33:30.306]  It's practically impossible!
[01:33:31.184 --> 01:33:32.645]  When will this madness end?
[01:33:33.926 --> 01:33:45.272]  The British public has been repeatedly told that even after the lockdown ends they will have to practice social distancing standing two meters away from the nearest person for months or even years into the future.
[01:33:46.212 --> 01:33:47.133]  This is impossible.
[01:33:47.433 --> 01:33:52.235]  Most notably London's transport system which is notoriously crowded virtually all the time.
[01:33:52.675 --> 01:33:57.198]  In fact during the height of these infections in London in the United Kingdom.
[01:33:57.742 --> 01:34:01.224]  The people pouring off the subway trains, the trains in London.
[01:34:01.945 --> 01:34:03.786]  No social distancing going on there.
[01:34:04.126 --> 01:34:05.807]  How is this even enforceable?
[01:34:05.947 --> 01:34:06.387]  It's not.
[01:34:07.348 --> 01:34:15.012]  Well, now the CEO of Heathrow Airport has poured cold water on the idea that social distancing could be practiced inside airports.
[01:34:15.933 --> 01:34:21.777]  He said, forget social distancing, it won't work in aviation or any other form of public transport.
[01:34:22.117 --> 01:34:25.739]  The problem is not the plane, it's the lack of space in the airport.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:31.861]  The largest passenger plane, the A380, seats 500 people.
[01:34:32.681 --> 01:34:37.983]  The notion that those people could keep two meters distance as they board the plane just isn't feasible.
[01:34:38.363 --> 01:34:48.325]  Now he's calling on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to come up with a common international standard of alternative solutions because that solution is just not going to cut it.
[01:34:48.985 --> 01:34:54.086]  Because we had the article which was discussed earlier, South African data analysts
[01:34:55.097 --> 01:34:58.898]  Lockdown will lead to 20 times more deaths than coronavirus.
[01:34:58.918 --> 01:35:09.761]  This is what I've been banging on about for the past three weeks, with top cancer experts in the UK and other countries saying, not only will the cure be worse than the virus, it will kill more people.
[01:35:11.461 --> 01:35:20.163]  The economic impact will kill more people because it leads to poverty, which leads to economic destitution, which leads to death.
[01:35:20.783 --> 01:35:23.164]  The Data Analyst Consortium in South Africa
[01:35:24.002 --> 01:35:30.583]  Asserts that the economic consequences of the country's lockdown will lead to 29 times more people dying than the coronavirus itself.
[01:35:31.463 --> 01:35:40.525]  The model, which is made public today, was developed by a consortium calling itself PANDA, Pandemic Data Analysis, which includes four actuaries.
[01:35:40.905 --> 01:35:45.006]  These are the people who do actuaries for insurance companies, an economist and a doctor.
[01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:47.946]  All the work was checked by lawyers and mathematicians.
[01:35:47.986 --> 01:35:51.427]  This was reported by the Financial Mail out of South Africa.
[01:35:52.466 --> 01:36:06.692]  According to the research, the 29 times figure is a conservative estimate, so it could be way higher, of how many lives will be lost due to the impact of poverty caused by economic hardship over the long term.
[01:36:07.813 --> 01:36:15.116]  They go on to explain, I think they actually use the data from New York and transpose it onto South Africa because New York has more data,
[01:36:16.232 --> 01:36:21.194]  They estimate 5.4 years of life have been lost for COVID-19 death.
[01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:32.057]  They then multiply this by the range of deaths, which they predict, 20,000, as well as the Actuarial Society's prediction of 88,000 fatalities.
[01:36:32.817 --> 01:36:35.778]  They factor in that the lockdown will have reduced some deaths, but not all.
[01:36:35.818 --> 01:36:40.279]  In the end, their model translated into a minimum 26,800 years of lives lost due to COVID-19 and a maximum
[01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:49.624]  Of 473,000 years.
[01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:52.406]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:36:52.446 --> 01:37:04.416]  The model shows that the number of years lost due to the economic collapse caused by the lockdown will be between 14 million and 24 million, which means a 29 times figure is on the low end and could be even higher.
[01:37:04.937 --> 01:37:13.264]  The model also showed that based on European data, 90% of COVID deaths were in people 70 or older with one or more comorbidity.
[01:37:13.942 --> 01:37:17.343]  With the relative risk of the young and healthy being negligible again.
[01:37:18.263 --> 01:37:23.465]  If you look, and I'm going to talk about, let me know if we have our guest by the way, I'm going to talk about this later.
[01:37:24.746 --> 01:37:35.249]  If you look at the people wearing masks in the parks where I live, most of the people out wearing masks are young people aged 25 to 40.
[01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:39.610]  The elderly people out in the parks or outside are not wearing masks.
[01:37:39.670 --> 01:37:41.091]  This mask has become like a
[01:37:41.954 --> 01:37:45.197]  A status symbol for people to feel superior to you.
[01:37:45.377 --> 01:37:47.299]  They've got this kind of smugness behind them.
[01:37:47.719 --> 01:37:50.602]  I'm going to talk about that with Andrew Tait because he's waiting on the line.
[01:37:51.042 --> 01:37:57.008]  Kickboxing world champion, entrepreneur, and all-round G. The website is CobraTait.com.
[01:37:57.088 --> 01:37:57.969]  Andrew, welcome back.
[01:37:59.350 --> 01:38:00.291]  It's been a while, man.
[01:38:00.331 --> 01:38:01.012]  It's been a while.
[01:38:02.253 --> 01:38:02.873]  Been too long.
[01:38:02.913 --> 01:38:03.914]  How's lockdown going?
[01:38:04.275 --> 01:38:05.736]  You had coronavirus, right?
[01:38:06.681 --> 01:38:07.782]  Yeah, you know what though?
[01:38:07.802 --> 01:38:08.523]  Let me tell you something.
[01:38:09.103 --> 01:38:10.564]  Everyone's had coronavirus.
[01:38:11.025 --> 01:38:15.908]  The logic, logic, to me, the logic deduction is that everybody's had coronavirus.
[01:38:16.028 --> 01:38:19.431]  I refuse to believe that a disease in which four out of five
[01:38:21.269 --> 01:38:27.494]  The people who do get sick show flu-like symptoms was instantly detected by the World Health Organization.
[01:38:27.614 --> 01:38:35.501]  I refuse to believe that, which means it's been around for a long time nobody knew, which means it's been all around the world, which means we've already all had the virus, which means this lockdown is a waste of time.
[01:38:35.921 --> 01:38:36.762]  That's my conclusion.
[01:38:38.263 --> 01:38:41.486]  Well there's actually evidence that came out yesterday which suggested that it was in
[01:38:42.324 --> 01:38:45.846]  People had it in France, I think, as far back as October.
[01:38:45.926 --> 01:38:53.791]  So there's now new evidence suggesting that it was circulating around the world long before we knew about it, maybe even before it was in China.
[01:38:53.831 --> 01:38:55.713]  But you went to Sweden.
[01:38:55.773 --> 01:39:00.576]  I talk about Sweden a lot, not always for the best reasons, but they actually got something right!
[01:39:01.216 --> 01:39:01.897]  This is how bad...
[01:39:03.294 --> 01:39:07.436]  For the first time in human history, this is how bad other governments have failed.
[01:39:07.456 --> 01:39:09.497]  Of course, they had no lockdown.
[01:39:09.957 --> 01:39:12.458]  Now they've got almost herd immunity.
[01:39:12.878 --> 01:39:14.519]  They didn't shut down their economy.
[01:39:14.799 --> 01:39:18.680]  Their economy is not going to be on its knees for the next three years like every other European country.
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:24.023]  And their death rate is lower per capita than the UK's death rate.
[01:39:24.363 --> 01:39:27.964]  Their R rate, which is the rate of infection, is below one.
[01:39:28.444 --> 01:39:32.306]  You went to Sweden, tell us what you saw, because it looks like they got it right.
[01:39:33.539 --> 01:39:34.880]  Yeah, they absolutely did get it right.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:45.686]  And not only do you see that things are open and life is completely as normal, nobody's wearing a mask, all the cafes are full, people are having coffee, the parks are full, people are walking around.
[01:39:46.047 --> 01:39:47.568]  And their view is very similar to mine.
[01:39:47.588 --> 01:39:53.671]  They said, listen, this virus has probably been around longer than we knew, and it's probably already got to Sweden and we were fine.
[01:39:54.091 --> 01:39:55.372]  And now everyone's being hypochondriac.
[01:39:55.392 --> 01:39:57.674]  So for the first time in history, the Swedes got something right.
[01:39:58.014 --> 01:39:59.395]  And Stockholm's business is normal.
[01:40:00.095 --> 01:40:01.236]  Absolutely business as usual.
[01:40:01.296 --> 01:40:03.057]  So it was pretty impressive to see.
[01:40:04.597 --> 01:40:11.979]  Now, of course, they relied on their own population to follow these social distancing rules, whether you believe they actually have any effect or not.
[01:40:12.519 --> 01:40:19.541]  I talked about evidence earlier suggesting that you have to be in prolonged close proximity with someone to transmit this disease.
[01:40:19.601 --> 01:40:30.224]  So this entire idea of us needing to remain two metres apart, which is practically impossible in terms of transport systems, in terms of airports, as the boss of Heathrow said,
[01:40:31.562 --> 01:40:32.703]  They had that going on.
[01:40:32.763 --> 01:40:44.451]  Of course, now you've got a situation with the mass, but in terms of Sweden, the UK, the polls show our population is still completely terrified by this coronavirus.
[01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:48.654]  They've been terrorized by weeks and weeks of government media hysteria.
[01:40:49.514 --> 01:40:54.017]  In Sweden, they said we're going to trust the population to keep social distancing.
[01:40:54.057 --> 01:40:59.661]  They did it, apart from in the migrant ghetto areas, which apparently nobody cares about enforcing it in those areas.
[01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:06.917]  What does it say about Sweden that their population is less terrified than the UK's population?
[01:41:07.178 --> 01:41:11.723]  How much of an experiment in mass conformity for the government has this been?
[01:41:12.842 --> 01:41:14.323]  Yeah, that's that's pretty crazy.
[01:41:14.383 --> 01:41:17.864]  I mean, this is the common cold tied in with a power grab.
[01:41:18.384 --> 01:41:25.848]  And it's pretty even I'm surprised by how quickly and how easily people have instantly cowered and said, OK, all right, we'll give up our livelihoods.
[01:41:26.408 --> 01:41:29.589]  I mean, it's OK for for me and it's OK for a few others who have money.
[01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:32.951]  But imagine you're sacrificing a business you've worked on your whole life.
[01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:40.866]  For this disease, which in all reality, all the data is showing, is far less deadly than anything they've ever told us it was.
[01:41:41.266 --> 01:41:43.848]  Or far less deadly than most things you can catch on a normal day.
[01:41:44.268 --> 01:41:46.230]  We're never going to live life bacteria-free.
[01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:50.073]  We're never going to be able to wander through the world without worrying about catching some kind of virus.
[01:41:50.593 --> 01:41:52.675]  That's not the goal of the human experience.
[01:41:52.715 --> 01:41:56.018]  We need a health service to take care of us if we're sick, which we have.
[01:41:56.318 --> 01:41:59.400]  And then we need to carry on with our lives and get things done.
[01:41:59.661 --> 01:42:01.002]  The whole lockdown is a waste of time.
[01:42:01.022 --> 01:42:01.362]  It's crazy.
[01:42:02.914 --> 01:42:04.195]  This is what Bill Maher talked about.
[01:42:04.275 --> 01:42:09.238]  It's as if after March 2020, humanity stopped having immune systems.
[01:42:09.318 --> 01:42:13.140]  Now we're literally being told you'll have to be in a pod to fly on an airplane.
[01:42:13.421 --> 01:42:15.622]  You have to be in a pod to go to a restaurant.
[01:42:15.642 --> 01:42:21.045]  They've got images of people sat in greenhouses saying, oh look how trendy and cozy it is.
[01:42:21.565 --> 01:42:25.068]  No, walking around in a giant de facto pod is not trendy or cozy.
[01:42:25.088 --> 01:42:26.488]  That's a massive inconvenience.
[01:42:26.949 --> 01:42:30.631]  Again, this social distancing is BS according to all the new studies coming out.
[01:42:30.871 --> 01:42:34.693]  I'm going to get into it more on the other side with Andrew Tate, CobraTate.com.
[01:42:34.733 --> 01:42:36.194]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[01:42:38.135 --> 01:42:41.657]  We are live back with Andrew Tate, CobraTate.com.
[01:42:41.677 --> 01:42:44.359]  Now, Andrew obviously does a lot of things.
[01:42:44.379 --> 01:42:57.086]  Little known fact is that he's partially to blame for the downfall of Western masculinity because he runs these cam girl studios where simps throw beta books at thots.
[01:42:57.166 --> 01:43:00.488]  And Andrew, I guess business is booming right now, right?
[01:43:01.556 --> 01:43:04.678]  Businesses at least tripled since the lockdown.
[01:43:05.159 --> 01:43:09.682]  So if the Western world's going to fall apart, it can at least make me rich on its way down.
[01:43:09.802 --> 01:43:17.027]  So I try my very, very best to, you know, you know, some of these guys, the girls will say to him, look, why don't you just go out and get a girlfriend, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:43:17.047 --> 01:43:18.628]  But these guys, they want to live this way.
[01:43:18.668 --> 01:43:21.410]  They want to send money to girls online and the girls work for me.
[01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:22.971]  So, yeah, business is doing very well.
[01:43:24.645 --> 01:43:32.709]  Yeah, I covered a story a few weeks ago where OnlyFans was saying that their sign-ups have been the fastest ever, both in terms of customers and people.
[01:43:33.209 --> 01:43:38.851]  Going on OnlyFans and performing, so yeah, business is obviously booming in that sector because everybody's staying inside.
[01:43:38.871 --> 01:43:40.332]  I want to get into masks.
[01:43:41.392 --> 01:43:47.575]  Now in the UK, unlike the US, areas of the US at least, it's not the law to wear masks.
[01:43:47.735 --> 01:43:49.156]  You don't have to wear masks anywhere.
[01:43:49.196 --> 01:43:52.277]  That's not in the social distancing lockdown laws.
[01:43:53.118 --> 01:43:54.178]  From what I've seen though,
[01:43:55.268 --> 01:43:58.350]  On my allotted one hour of daily exercise out in the park.
[01:43:58.370 --> 01:44:00.772]  You see all kinds of different people, all kinds of different ages.
[01:44:01.332 --> 01:44:06.035]  This mask, it's become kind of a status symbol of smugness.
[01:44:06.636 --> 01:44:13.841]  Adopted by, you know, cringe normies to make themselves feel superior to you because they probably have a massive inferiority complex.
[01:44:14.201 --> 01:44:22.406]  I've noticed elderly people who are susceptible to coronavirus, people who have pre-existing conditions, which is fair enough, wear a mask.
[01:44:22.466 --> 01:44:23.407]  I totally understand that.
[01:44:24.031 --> 01:44:25.292]  They're not wearing the masks.
[01:44:25.952 --> 01:44:29.174]  The people wearing the masks are aged 25 to 40.
[01:44:29.274 --> 01:44:31.035]  And I tweeted about this the other day.
[01:44:31.716 --> 01:44:33.457]  Three types of mask wearers.
[01:44:33.477 --> 01:44:36.739]  Because this has become a kind of new status symbol of conformity.
[01:44:37.499 --> 01:44:40.341]  You've got older people who are genuinely at risk, fair enough.
[01:44:41.362 --> 01:44:49.427]  Then you've got people who have been so terrorised by this constant bombardment of death statistics and media hysteria about coronavirus that they think
[01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:59.476]  I'm sure some of them actually think that they can catch it just by walking outside and that COVID-19 is literally circulating everywhere in the air.
[01:44:59.816 --> 01:45:02.818]  You've got that category of people who've been so terrified.
[01:45:03.438 --> 01:45:06.140]  Then you've got this other category, and I've noticed
[01:45:06.863 --> 01:45:09.064]  They want to feel smug in their obedience.
[01:45:09.124 --> 01:45:10.585]  It's like, who can conform?
[01:45:11.046 --> 01:45:14.188]  Who can jump the highest when the government asks them to the most?
[01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:17.009]  And they broadcast how much better they are than you.
[01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:19.491]  And they don't even social distance, Andrew.
[01:45:19.851 --> 01:45:26.815]  If you're in the supermarket, the people wearing masks think they can ignore this social distancing stuff because they're of a higher class.
[01:45:26.855 --> 01:45:27.576]  Have you noticed this?
[01:45:28.701 --> 01:45:31.223]  Everyone I've seen with a mask is constantly playing with it as well.
[01:45:31.243 --> 01:45:32.624]  I thought we weren't supposed to touch our face.
[01:45:33.084 --> 01:45:36.287]  They're constantly adjusting it around their nose, putting it on, taking it off.
[01:45:36.747 --> 01:45:39.069]  It's just they're trying to advertise to the world what a dork they are.
[01:45:39.129 --> 01:45:40.990]  I'm a nerd and I do everything the government says.
[01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:45.313]  Listen, the World Health Organization did not identify this virus in its infancy.
[01:45:45.353 --> 01:45:46.874]  The virus has been around for a long time.
[01:45:47.154 --> 01:45:48.255]  It's already spread everywhere.
[01:45:48.535 --> 01:45:49.656]  It doesn't affect most people.
[01:45:49.676 --> 01:45:51.117]  And if it does affect you, you go to the hospital.
[01:45:51.157 --> 01:45:51.758]  That's the end of it.
[01:45:52.638 --> 01:45:54.680]  The whole world is insane.
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:56.281]  I cannot believe this has happened.
[01:45:56.621 --> 01:45:58.422]  We must live in some kind of simulation, Paul.
[01:45:58.802 --> 01:46:00.423]  How has the whole world turned off?
[01:46:00.704 --> 01:46:02.145]  There's not even a huge mortality rate.
[01:46:02.165 --> 01:46:06.147]  You'd expect, for a virus that would shut down the world, I expected a zombie apocalypse.
[01:46:07.128 --> 01:46:08.149]  There's nothing like that.
[01:46:08.309 --> 01:46:09.389]  It's absolutely nothing like this.
[01:46:09.449 --> 01:46:10.050]  It's insane.
[01:46:10.410 --> 01:46:12.291]  And there's two countries, Belarus and Sweden.
[01:46:12.632 --> 01:46:13.612]  Sweden I've already been to.
[01:46:13.652 --> 01:46:15.393]  Belarus I'm trying to go to in the next three days.
[01:46:15.814 --> 01:46:17.715]  Where nothing's closed and everyone's fine.
[01:46:18.714 --> 01:46:29.538]  Imagine working a job and imagine having your life savings destroyed or your company destroyed in the name of a virus where there's other countries proving in real time that the lockdown is a bullshit.
[01:46:29.878 --> 01:46:30.818]  Sorry, didn't mean to swear.
[01:46:31.198 --> 01:46:33.019]  But you get the point I'm making.
[01:46:33.079 --> 01:46:34.179]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:46:34.219 --> 01:46:35.160]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:38.541]  I think it's just a power grab wrapped up with the common cold.
[01:46:38.581 --> 01:46:39.021]  That's all it is.
[01:46:40.154 --> 01:46:40.715]  It's incredible.
[01:46:40.755 --> 01:46:48.943]  I mean, we were told, and I've mentioned this before, we needed these social distancing lockdown measures for a period of six to eight weeks to get back to the new normal.
[01:46:49.343 --> 01:46:51.245]  Now they're saying, no, forget about that.
[01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:53.981]  You're never going to get back to normal.
[01:46:54.021 --> 01:46:55.082]  This is the new normal.
[01:46:55.122 --> 01:46:58.363]  They're talking about drone surveillance to enforce social distancing.
[01:46:58.663 --> 01:47:03.506]  They're talking about putting markings on the pavement so you have to stay two metres away from everybody.
[01:47:03.986 --> 01:47:09.509]  Literally filling the street with more street furniture, more signs telling you what you can and can't do.
[01:47:09.829 --> 01:47:14.311]  This won't even work, as I've said, in airports and trains because it's practically impossible.
[01:47:14.671 --> 01:47:17.914]  This is going to lead to the increasing atomization of society.
[01:47:18.214 --> 01:47:20.616]  What's the real agenda behind these draconian measures?
[01:47:20.696 --> 01:47:29.023]  Is it just so they can reintroduce it on a whim and use it to impose a de facto prison camp where we're all literally walking around in pods?
[01:47:30.564 --> 01:47:31.105]  Absolutely!
[01:47:31.365 --> 01:47:37.090]  When is the last time a government has taken power under the guise of safety and given the power back?
[01:47:37.651 --> 01:47:37.851]  Ever!
[01:47:38.352 --> 01:47:39.392]  When has that ever happened?
[01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:52.845]  When is the last time a government said, oh we just need to spy on your emails for a little while, we just need to tap your phone for a little while, oh we just need to censor your speech for a little while, oh we just need to make sure you don't say hateful things for a little while, but in the future we're going to go back.
[01:47:53.065 --> 01:47:53.346]  Never!
[01:47:53.806 --> 01:47:55.688]  Every single thing they introduce, they keep forever.
[01:47:56.008 --> 01:48:02.313]  And the reason they're saying we may have to go back at any point is so they can press a button at any point in the future, get everyone else locked inside their house again.
[01:48:02.633 --> 01:48:07.437]  You have to understand the people who are in charge of the world, the elites, are beyond money.
[01:48:07.817 --> 01:48:08.838]  They don't care about money.
[01:48:08.858 --> 01:48:09.959]  They print money on demand.
[01:48:10.019 --> 01:48:10.879]  Money doesn't matter to them.
[01:48:10.919 --> 01:48:12.801]  They have no problem destroying an economy.
[01:48:13.221 --> 01:48:14.741]  And you talk about the new normal here with the power grab.
[01:48:39.631 --> 01:48:46.593]  The new standard now for social media censorship, and this was introduced first by YouTube, now Twitter and Facebook have basically followed suit.
[01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:52.714]  The new standard for you being banned on social media is questioning authorities.
[01:48:53.094 --> 01:48:53.654]  That's it.
[01:48:53.974 --> 01:48:54.895]  And who's an authority?
[01:48:54.955 --> 01:49:00.796]  Anyone who they say is, despite the fact that trust in mainstream media is at record low and nobody trusts these authorities anyway.
[01:49:01.385 --> 01:49:10.213]  To the point where they had two licensed professional doctors giving a one and a half hour calm, collected lecture on COVID-19.
[01:49:10.753 --> 01:49:13.195]  Five million plus views on YouTube.
[01:49:13.516 --> 01:49:14.577]  They yanked the video.
[01:49:15.097 --> 01:49:16.899]  Now, it doesn't even make sense.
[01:49:17.539 --> 01:49:18.920]  It got five million views.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:19.941]  That would have paled off.
[01:49:20.121 --> 01:49:21.963]  Most people would have watched it by that point.
[01:49:22.463 --> 01:49:27.548]  It got bumped up into the news once again because of the reason that they censored it.
[01:49:28.274 --> 01:49:31.855]  If they start censoring stuff, that's going to make people believe it even more, no?
[01:49:33.055 --> 01:49:35.556]  That's what's completely crazy about these authority figures.
[01:49:35.776 --> 01:49:41.217]  The companies and the organizations that they say are authoritarian and they're completely correct and you cannot disagree with them.
[01:49:41.657 --> 01:49:52.960]  Of all the organizations, before this whole COVID nonsense, before this virus, of all the organizations I thought that may be at least capable, I would have assumed it'd be the World Health Organization.
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:55.021]  Because the idea is very simple.
[01:49:55.282 --> 01:50:02.847]  There's no bipartisan, there's no conservative liberal, it's just doctors around the world who want to keep people alive.
[01:50:03.127 --> 01:50:04.809]  But it turns out they're incompetent.
[01:50:05.049 --> 01:50:06.470]  It turns out they get everything wrong.
[01:50:06.690 --> 01:50:17.298]  You have doctors from all around the world who can't even sit there and deal with the common cold in a very simple and different form without lying about whether it spreads from person to person and sending all these lies out.
[01:50:17.538 --> 01:50:19.920]  So they're completely media controlled and they're completely a puppet.
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:22.542]  If the World Health Organization are puppets,
[01:50:22.902 --> 01:50:26.804]  And they're at the whims of the elite billionaires who are trying to control the world.
[01:50:27.044 --> 01:50:27.965]  They're nothing safe.
[01:50:28.005 --> 01:50:31.746]  That any authority you can possibly name is nothing but propaganda.
[01:50:32.727 --> 01:50:38.129]  Before the virus, I would not have believed how deceptive the World Health Organization would be on purpose.
[01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:40.090]  Look at their track record on this virus.
[01:50:40.110 --> 01:50:42.051]  They've got every single thing wrong.
[01:50:42.351 --> 01:50:45.933]  These are the doctors, and they've got everything wrong from start to finish.
[01:50:46.193 --> 01:50:47.254]  Constantly flip-flopping their
[01:50:48.306 --> 01:50:51.527]  Everything they're told to say to keep people scared and in their house.
[01:50:51.807 --> 01:50:52.567]  It's fake news.
[01:50:53.828 --> 01:50:56.289]  And these are the bodies that you're not allowed to question.
[01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:59.490]  Literally caught covering up the spread of coronavirus for China.
[01:50:59.550 --> 01:51:07.653]  Covering up for China and silencing their own doctors who were in the WHO meeting saying we need to tell countries to close their borders.
[01:51:08.213 --> 01:51:09.233]  WHO said no.
[01:51:09.593 --> 01:51:12.474]  Those are the trusted authorities that you're not allowed to question.
[01:51:12.634 --> 01:51:14.495]  Even though, as you say, they got it completely wrong.
[01:51:14.975 --> 01:51:18.798]  We're back with Andrew Tate talking about coronavirus.
[01:51:18.818 --> 01:51:24.142]  Now, of course, Andrew, a favourite topic of mine is TikTok nurse dancing videos.
[01:51:24.182 --> 01:51:26.104]  We've seen these for the past two months.
[01:51:26.164 --> 01:51:27.565]  They don't seem to be stopping.
[01:51:27.585 --> 01:51:31.048]  They even had one a few days ago where the nurses were carrying
[01:51:31.738 --> 01:51:35.140]  A mock corpse with COVID-19 written on it.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:41.363]  They're wearing PPE, which we were told was dangerously low on stock and couldn't be misused.
[01:51:41.903 --> 01:51:44.304]  We were told that hospitals would be overwhelmed.
[01:51:44.705 --> 01:51:49.227]  Turns out that in the UK acute hospital beds are four times emptier than normal.
[01:51:49.587 --> 01:51:53.669]  They're closing down some of these overspill hospitals because they've never been used.
[01:51:54.610 --> 01:51:57.551]  But they all have time to dance around and make TikTok videos.
[01:51:58.091 --> 01:52:01.293]  What does it say about how desperate you need to be for internet clout?
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:07.284]  And the state of narcissism in Western society that this is what we're seeing.
[01:52:09.385 --> 01:52:11.867]  I cannot imagine anything more disrespectful.
[01:52:12.446 --> 01:52:15.527]  To the people who are dying in hospital of something else.
[01:52:15.667 --> 01:52:16.468]  Forget COVID.
[01:52:16.828 --> 01:52:19.549]  You have a heart attack, you go to the hospital, you die.
[01:52:19.949 --> 01:52:22.891]  Are you telling me and then doctors and nurses are doing this?
[01:52:23.351 --> 01:52:32.135]  Are you telling me there is not a single activity they could participate in at their place of work, which would be more likely to save a life than making a TikTok video?
[01:52:32.575 --> 01:52:34.036]  This is more than just a waste of time.
[01:52:34.076 --> 01:52:40.259]  It's absolutely disrespectful to the people who are there with life-threatening conditions outside of this virus that we all talk about.
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:43.201]  These people should be reprimanded severely.
[01:52:43.501 --> 01:52:48.164]  If I was in charge, every single person I caught doing a stupid dance would be fired on the spot.
[01:52:48.804 --> 01:52:50.585]  If there's ever a time in your life
[01:52:51.147 --> 01:52:52.708]  To take your job seriously.
[01:52:53.068 --> 01:52:54.530]  It's during a global pandemic.
[01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:59.253]  I mean, as a doctor or nurse, you should probably take your job seriously pretty much every day.
[01:52:59.613 --> 01:53:11.682]  But during a global pandemic, which is being advertised as saying that the world's going to turn into a war zone and everyone's losing their jobs, that's probably a pretty good time to take your job relatively seriously and not dance around like a fool.
[01:53:12.162 --> 01:53:13.924]  All of these people should be fired instantly.
[01:53:14.164 --> 01:53:16.385]  This does nothing but destroy confidence.
[01:53:18.061 --> 01:53:21.663]  Paul, would you trust any of those people to operate on your heart or your brain?
[01:53:22.104 --> 01:53:25.526]  I'm asking you a direct question after watching their TikTok.
[01:53:25.906 --> 01:53:27.967]  It destroys confidence in the healthcare system.
[01:53:28.508 --> 01:53:40.995]  Why are we paying such ridiculous taxes in the UK, getting destroyed to fund an NHS, which every single year they have to put more and more tax on for us to fund, for these people to run around and make stupid videos?
[01:53:41.035 --> 01:53:42.036]  This is beyond a joke.
[01:53:42.603 --> 01:53:43.324]  It's beyond a joke.
[01:53:43.404 --> 01:53:44.705]  They should put me in charge of the NHS.
[01:53:44.725 --> 01:53:45.726]  But of course, Andrew.
[01:53:45.766 --> 01:53:47.548]  We've been told, Andrew, you can't trust them.
[01:53:47.588 --> 01:53:49.009]  These are the new heroes.
[01:53:49.089 --> 01:53:50.671]  How dare you insult them?
[01:53:50.691 --> 01:53:51.932]  They're just letting off steam.
[01:53:52.172 --> 01:54:00.781]  Then you had actual family members of cancer victims saying, hang on, we can't even get into hospital to get chemotherapy, to get screenings for cancer.
[01:54:01.161 --> 01:54:03.462]  There's plenty of time for them to dance around in TikTok videos.
[01:54:03.482 --> 01:54:09.366]  You've had doctors come out now, and nurses, I featured one in my recent video, they're questioning this.
[01:54:09.426 --> 01:54:15.029]  So now that, you know, family members of cancer victims, actual doctors are questioning it, hopefully it'll subside.
[01:54:15.069 --> 01:54:17.050]  Shows no signs of subsiding so far.
[01:54:17.711 --> 01:54:21.993]  Talk about this Professor Lockdown that I talked about this earlier.
[01:54:22.333 --> 01:54:25.215]  The very guy in the UK responsible
[01:54:25.842 --> 01:54:33.688]  For being the architect of this policy, this lockdown policy, they claimed, he claimed, based on his model, which has been completely discredited.
[01:54:34.964 --> 01:54:39.287]  500,000 people would die in the UK if we didn't do what he said and lockdown.
[01:54:39.627 --> 01:54:43.989]  The British government reversed its position based on his discredited model.
[01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:45.510]  Lockdown the entire country.
[01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:46.511]  We're still in lockdown.
[01:54:46.751 --> 01:54:50.013]  We're being told, oh, we might let you out for a picnic in three weeks.
[01:54:50.653 --> 01:54:57.437]  This guy behind the entire programme gets caught having his mistress, who is married with two kids, visit him.
[01:54:57.937 --> 01:54:58.958]  Now he's resigned.
[01:54:59.358 --> 01:55:00.699]  What does it say about people?
[01:55:01.363 --> 01:55:08.646]  We're so serious about emphasizing the need for compliance, but then they act in a totally non-compliant manner.
[01:55:09.986 --> 01:55:11.167]  Oh yeah, Mr. Horny.
[01:55:11.467 --> 01:55:12.487]  I heard about Mr. Horny.
[01:55:12.987 --> 01:55:14.348]  This dude should do jail time!
[01:55:15.108 --> 01:55:16.369]  He shut the whole country down!
[01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:18.029]  Why is he not going to jail?
[01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:26.052]  He lied to the government, shut the country down, ruined millions of lives, and he gets to run around with his... I don't want to say that on Live on Infowars.
[01:55:26.432 --> 01:55:30.514]  With his desires, and he's not facing jail time!
[01:55:31.115 --> 01:55:34.820]  This is a typical example of why you should never believe what the elites say.
[01:55:35.261 --> 01:55:38.405]  I will take coronavirus seriously when the elites take it seriously.
[01:55:38.725 --> 01:55:43.812]  This guy, the man who's in charge of the fake computer model, he's not concerned, so I'm not concerned.
[01:55:44.152 --> 01:55:44.953]  I'm not concerned about...
[01:55:46.650 --> 01:55:49.290]  I see rich billionaires buying beachfront property.
[01:55:49.591 --> 01:55:54.971]  When they stop buying beachfront property and start trying to buy all the houses on top of mountains, I'll care.
[01:55:55.252 --> 01:56:00.112]  But until then, I don't care because there's nothing else but scaremongering and a power grab.
[01:56:00.352 --> 01:56:01.053]  That's all it is.
[01:56:01.313 --> 01:56:03.133]  This guy should do jail time instantly.
[01:56:03.173 --> 01:56:04.213]  Resigning's not enough.
[01:56:04.653 --> 01:56:08.874]  The worst thing about these computer models, I can come up with a computer model for anything.
[01:56:09.134 --> 01:56:11.714]  The numbers you put in dictates what comes out.
[01:56:11.974 --> 01:56:13.955]  I can type in random numbers to come up with a model.
[01:56:14.135 --> 01:56:15.135]  It doesn't mean anything.
[01:56:15.815 --> 01:56:33.390]  England could have actually, for once in its life, in recent history, did the right thing, and for once made me semi-proud to be British, left the country open like Sweden did, reached herd immunity, and proved that a country that just has a bit of common sense could continue to function, and the health system will continue to look after the people who need to be looked after.
[01:56:33.670 --> 01:56:40.676]  But instead, they reversed everything based on, like you said, the recommendation of Mr. Horny, who's running around breaking his own rules.
[01:56:41.403 --> 01:56:43.324]  Do not listen to the elites, because they don't listen.
[01:56:43.864 --> 01:56:48.545]  When the rich people stop flying on private jets and buying houses on the beach, care about climate change.
[01:56:48.885 --> 01:56:54.587]  When Mr. Horny starts staying in his house, locked up, scared to do news interviews, then you can worry about coronavirus.
[01:56:54.847 --> 01:56:59.068]  Until then, it's something about propaganda and a bid to control ordinary people.
[01:57:00.588 --> 01:57:03.709]  It's interesting because the government reversed their policy.
[01:57:03.889 --> 01:57:06.570]  They were originally going to go with a Sweden-type policy.
[01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:09.391]  They reversed the policy based on this guy's fear-mongering.
[01:57:09.986 --> 01:57:21.473]  And as a result of that, they terrorise the British population to such a degree that even now, a majority of people, according to the most recent polls, don't want this lockdown to even end.
[01:57:21.533 --> 01:57:22.474]  There was a poll which said
[01:57:23.634 --> 01:57:33.656]  I think 60% wanted the government to close the parks, the only place basically that we're allowed to go, because they were terrorized so much by this propaganda.
[01:57:34.136 --> 01:57:34.976]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:57:34.996 --> 01:57:39.937]  And the guy behind it all is the first one to violate his own lockdown laws.
[01:57:40.077 --> 01:57:40.997]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:57:41.017 --> 01:57:51.679]  And in fact, this mistress, this 38-year-old woman who is married with two children and has an open marriage, that means, you know what it means.
[01:57:52.933 --> 01:57:54.835]  Interesting that she would be at the center of this.
[01:57:55.395 --> 01:58:13.631]  She did a podcast 24 hours after visiting Professor Pantstown, Professor Lockdown, in which she complained that the lockdown was putting a strain on her marriage while she was literally visiting the guy, having an affair with the guy responsible for the lockdown.
[01:58:13.691 --> 01:58:14.711]  How's that for irony?
[01:58:16.213 --> 01:58:17.914]  Mr. Lockdown looks like a nerd.
[01:58:18.655 --> 01:58:21.137]  And there's certain levels of nerdity I will tolerate.
[01:58:21.741 --> 01:58:26.223]  But if you show his face again, there is no need to look like this unless you're trying to project something.
[01:58:26.604 --> 01:58:29.185]  He looks like this to try and project to the world that he's smart.
[01:58:29.465 --> 01:58:38.530]  He's decided to look like a geek and a dork for his entire human life so everyone can look at him and think, oh, he's a nerd, but he might be smart with his stupid little glasses.
[01:58:38.850 --> 01:58:40.231]  Now we know he doesn't know anything.
[01:58:40.471 --> 01:58:44.333]  He can't control his urges when he's running around trying to have adulterous sex.
[01:58:44.773 --> 01:58:45.574]  He should go to jail.
[01:58:47.407 --> 01:58:48.368]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:50.589]  Now, we've got a couple of minutes left here, Tate.
[01:58:50.609 --> 01:58:54.051]  Just tell people about, you know, what people should do in the last three weeks of lockdown.
[01:58:54.091 --> 01:58:57.573]  Money, fitness, mindset, and some of the projects that you've got going on right now.
[01:58:58.803 --> 01:58:59.223]  Absolutely.
[01:58:59.283 --> 01:59:06.309]  I think the one good thing about the lockdown is it's been a good chance for people if they've used the time correctly to sit and reset and understand something.
[01:59:06.609 --> 01:59:08.150]  The government doesn't care about you.
[01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:10.212]  Your job doesn't really care about you.
[01:59:10.492 --> 01:59:13.054]  It's all about you and you have to find a way to fend for yourself.
[01:59:13.094 --> 01:59:23.682]  And I think that hopefully there'll be a good mentality and mindset change amongst people when they see that when stuff really hits the fan and things really get hard, the only person gonna be able to count on is yourself and the people around you.
[01:59:24.082 --> 01:59:26.604]  I think that's one of the good things that could have possibly come out from the lockdown.
[01:59:27.210 --> 01:59:29.611]  So, CobraTate.com, I have a lot of courses on there.
[01:59:29.631 --> 01:59:31.772]  I explain a lot of things, how to make money, etc, etc.
[01:59:32.072 --> 01:59:32.512]  And I'll help you.
[01:59:32.532 --> 01:59:35.313]  You can go check out the website, message the live chat, and they'll talk everything through.
[01:59:35.333 --> 01:59:36.434]  I won't talk about it too much here.
[01:59:36.894 --> 01:59:48.559]  But, certainly from a mental, from a mentality standpoint, and a financial standpoint, there's a lot of people who realize just how fragile they are, and this is a good chance to change that, because once something bad starts happening, it never fixed.
[01:59:48.599 --> 01:59:54.121]  This lockdown thing, it's something we've never seen before in our lives, and it's going to be something we're going to start seeing more and more often.
[01:59:54.461 --> 01:59:55.382]  It's another tool.
[01:59:55.722 --> 01:59:59.464]  So if you're struggling now in the lockdown, let me tell you this.
[01:59:59.824 --> 02:00:00.825]  It's going to come again.
[02:00:01.205 --> 02:00:02.025]  It's coming back.
[02:00:02.345 --> 02:00:03.346]  So you better prepare for it.
[02:00:03.386 --> 02:00:06.127]  So if you're sitting there going, I can just get through the lockdown and get back to work.
[02:00:06.428 --> 02:00:07.488]  The lockdown is coming back.
[02:00:07.528 --> 02:00:08.429]  It's all going to come back.
[02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:09.789]  This is another tool now.
[02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:17.414]  They're going to use another thumbscrew to punish the ordinary citizen for living a life outside of their billionaire circle.
[02:00:17.474 --> 02:00:19.255]  So prepare yourself and be ready.
[02:00:19.275 --> 02:00:19.935]  That's all I can say.
[02:00:19.955 --> 02:00:21.596]  All right.
[02:00:21.636 --> 02:00:22.656]  CobraTate.com.
[02:00:22.716 --> 02:00:23.637]  Andrew, thanks for joining us.
[02:00:24.702 --> 02:00:25.743]  Absolutely, thank you very much.
[02:00:26.704 --> 02:00:29.546]  There goes Andrew Tait, number 1G.
[02:00:29.626 --> 02:00:33.390]  We're going to be back in the next segment to talk about Germany's coronavirus death rate.
[02:00:34.130 --> 02:00:36.953]  Ten times lower than official figures show.
[02:00:36.993 --> 02:00:48.823]  This is after Angela Merkel came out and said that 53 million Germans would be infected with it and that it would have a death rate of something in line with WHO's 3.4%.
[02:00:49.183 --> 02:00:50.124]  Once again, total lies.
[02:00:50.184 --> 02:00:51.325]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[02:00:52.276 --> 02:00:56.819]  We're back for the final segment before I get back into some more breaking news stories.
[02:00:56.859 --> 02:00:59.000]  In fact, an update on Professor Pantsdown.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:03.883]  I want to direct you to InfoWarsStore.com where we have the Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:08.846]  And this is if you want to boost or swap out your current fish oil with a powerful new formula.

[02:01:30.624 --> 02:01:31.844]  Absolutely delicious.

[02:01:33.125 --> 02:01:38.467]  And of course, TurboForce, the energy drink, which is absolutely a game changer.
[02:01:38.567 --> 02:01:39.727]  Really, really powerful.

[02:01:43.468 --> 02:01:44.609]  Having done a two hour show,
[02:01:45.555 --> 02:01:50.497]  It's available again at discount at InfoWarsStore.com Turbo Force Energy Drink.

[02:02:16.403 --> 02:02:17.383]  Now, back to the news.
[02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:25.385]  BBC reports coronavirus Neil Ferguson, that's Professor Pants, down to face no police action for undermining lockdown.
[02:02:25.425 --> 02:02:26.466]  Well, what a surprise.
[02:02:26.926 --> 02:02:40.449]  Despite the fact that police have handed out probably now thousands and thousands of fines for the ordinary plebs who have broken the lockdown laws, Professor Neil Ferguson will not face police action after he accepted making an error of judgment.
[02:02:41.252 --> 02:02:43.093]  By breaching social distancing rules.
[02:02:43.153 --> 02:02:49.655]  By having his mistress, the mother of two children, visit him for his sordid little affair.
[02:02:50.596 --> 02:02:56.378]  Scotland Yard said Professor Ferguson's behaviour was plainly disappointing, but ruled out issuing a fine.
[02:02:56.438 --> 02:02:57.379]  Not even going to get a fine.
[02:02:58.379 --> 02:03:00.140]  Force said he had taken responsibility.
[02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:05.622]  Alright, so if you break the law and say, oh I'm sorry, I take responsibility, then you're immune apparently.
[02:03:07.017 --> 02:03:10.859]  Professor Ferguson said he regretted undermining social distancing rules.
[02:03:10.919 --> 02:03:14.321]  So again, police have said they're not going to take any further action.
[02:03:14.742 --> 02:03:16.823]  Nothing whatsoever will happen to him.
[02:03:17.083 --> 02:03:27.029]  They're not even going to give him a £60 fine for breaking his own lockdown law that led to the shutdown of the economy of the entire country.
[02:03:27.529 --> 02:03:33.193]  Meanwhile, Black Mirror creator not working on season six because we already feel depressed,
[02:03:34.082 --> 02:03:35.163]  This is Charlie Brooker.
[02:03:35.183 --> 02:03:43.468]  In fact, I've got a friend who writes with Charlie Brooker, and he said he believes humanity could use a bleakness break.
[02:03:44.268 --> 02:03:51.512]  Of course, if you haven't seen it, Black Mirror is a TV series which basically portrays the world as a high-tech dystopia.
[02:03:52.133 --> 02:03:59.177]  And the longer it goes on, the further the world actually edges closer to being exactly like the world portrayed in his series.
[02:04:00.037 --> 02:04:11.387]  He's revealed to the UK's Radio Times he's not currently working on writing season six of Netflix's Emmy-winning series because we've already found ourselves plunged into a nightmarish dystopia like those explored in his shows.
[02:04:12.128 --> 02:04:20.536]  Though he's not writing that because the world is becoming too similar to the dystopian hellscape portrayed in his fictional series.
[02:04:20.976 --> 02:04:26.341]  Meanwhile, Mayor of Nice calls for health passports giving citizens permission to travel.
[02:04:27.068 --> 02:04:30.871]  Mayor of Nice has called for citizens to be required to carry health passports if they wish to travel.
[02:04:30.911 --> 02:04:43.141]  This again is similar to the immunity ID cards that the German government is talking about, which again creates an added layer of bureaucracy of regulation needing government permission to travel.
[02:04:44.141 --> 02:04:49.646]  Of course, when the vaccine rolls out, which we've been told will be in about a year or so's time,
[02:04:51.084 --> 02:04:57.787]  Maybe those ID cards will say whether you've had the vaccine or not, and if you haven't had the vaccine, well, maybe no traveling for you.
[02:04:58.827 --> 02:05:00.028]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:05:01.088 --> 02:05:01.508]  Video.
[02:05:01.648 --> 02:05:05.950]  Senator Cotton says China should provide evidence to disprove coronavirus lab leak.
[02:05:06.951 --> 02:05:17.235]  There's a Senator Tom Cotton who said Tuesday the onus is on China to produce evidence that will dispute the global intelligence assessment that there is a high possibility the coronavirus could have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[02:05:18.255 --> 02:05:19.376]  Of course, the bat
[02:05:20.305 --> 02:05:29.278]  that they say the coronavirus emerged out of is the horseshoe bat according to the studies which was not sold at the Wuhan wet market.
[02:05:29.338 --> 02:05:34.846]  So how could it have come from a horseshoe bat if it came from the wet market when that bat was not present?
[02:05:35.737 --> 02:05:39.441]  Where it was present is at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, just a coincidence.
[02:05:39.821 --> 02:05:44.706]  Appearing on Fox News, Cotton said all of the evidence will be at circumstantial points directly at those labs.
[02:05:44.746 --> 02:05:46.728]  Of course, Trump has harped on this time and time again.
[02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:52.154]  The media still comes out almost every day and says, there's no evidence it came from the lab.
[02:05:52.434 --> 02:05:53.315]  The same media
[02:05:54.628 --> 02:05:55.048]  That's right.
[02:06:15.498 --> 02:06:18.742]  Because now they're the de facto Communist Party state media.
[02:06:19.262 --> 02:06:24.488]  Ted Cruz says Hollywood is complicit in Chinese censorship, introduces bill to restrict production.
[02:06:24.508 --> 02:06:32.557]  Senator Ted Cruz has introduced legislation that would see Hollywood production severely limited if they're found to be bowing to Chinese censors.
[02:06:32.937 --> 02:06:35.320]  Of course, for years, for probably over 10 years now,
[02:06:36.101 --> 02:06:59.072]  Hollywood films have had to be edited to remove things that offend the Chinese government, so that they then can be played and sold in the lucrative Chinese market, to the point that there was a movie last year about Freddie Mercury of Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody, where they had to delete all the scenes which referenced the fact that Freddie Mercury was gay.
[02:07:00.914 --> 02:07:03.796]  Now that's like 20% of the movie.
[02:07:04.157 --> 02:07:10.401]  Whatever your beliefs or standpoint on homosexuality are, that's like 20% of what the movie's based on.
[02:07:10.642 --> 02:07:13.844]  They had to cut out all of that to sell it in China.
[02:07:14.345 --> 02:07:23.752]  Now Ted Cruz has introduced a bill to try and roll some of that back, because again, China is increasingly controlling US culture, and now US academia.
[02:07:25.013 --> 02:07:28.816]  US universities now shutting down arms of China's propaganda machine.
[02:07:29.634 --> 02:07:30.214]  Another U.S.
[02:07:30.274 --> 02:07:44.799]  university has announced it's shutting down its Confucius Institute, the organization which is overseen by the Chinese Ministry of Education, amid charges that the cultural exchange programs are being used by the communist state to indoctrinate Americans and spread Chinese propaganda.
[02:07:44.819 --> 02:07:52.581]  The University of California Davis is the latest of a string of universities to act the Confucius Institute after heightened concerns among U.S.
[02:07:52.621 --> 02:07:55.302]  officials that China is abusing the program.
[02:07:55.602 --> 02:07:57.263]  So it started off as a program,
[02:07:58.763 --> 02:08:17.074]  to teach people Chinese recipes, Chinese cooking, then it became Chinese culture, now it's Chinese language and it's obviously meant to subvert, infiltrate the US education system, which as we've seen is not that hard to do if you've got a hard left agenda.
[02:08:18.295 --> 02:08:20.016]  Information Liberation Reports
[02:08:21.184 --> 02:08:25.807]  Researcher on verge of making very significant coronavirus findings shot in their head.
[02:08:26.328 --> 02:08:27.048]  Just a coincidence.
[02:08:27.408 --> 02:08:33.072]  A Twitter user evidently predicted this would happen over a month ago and that tweet is included in the article.
[02:08:33.853 --> 02:08:41.978]  NBC News reports a medical researcher said to be on the verge of making very significant coronavirus findings was shot to death over the weekend in Pennsylvania.
[02:08:42.658 --> 02:08:43.179]  Bing Liu.
[02:08:44.801 --> 02:08:51.164]  In 1937, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine was found dead Saturday inside a home in Ross Township, north of Pittsburgh.
[02:08:51.905 --> 02:08:53.105]  He'd been shot in the head.
[02:08:53.125 --> 02:08:59.949]  An hour after his body was discovered, a second person was found dead inside a car less than a mile away.
[02:09:00.449 --> 02:09:08.673]  Investigators believe the second person killed Lou before returning to his car, where he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
[02:09:09.315 --> 02:09:13.898]  The guy who was killed was working on a cure for coronavirus.
[02:09:13.958 --> 02:09:16.400]  Very interesting coincidence there.
[02:09:17.701 --> 02:09:22.084]  We have people being arrested for cutting people's hair.
[02:09:22.104 --> 02:09:23.945]  We covered that earlier in the show.
[02:09:23.985 --> 02:09:26.807]  We covered media staging earlier in the show.
[02:09:27.667 --> 02:09:28.528]  Sweden, of course.
[02:09:28.548 --> 02:09:29.789]  This is our spectator.
[02:09:30.968 --> 02:09:34.051]  Sweden tames its R number without lockdown.
[02:09:34.632 --> 02:09:38.155]  As I've explained, Sweden did not lock down its entire economy.
[02:09:38.496 --> 02:09:43.541]  They merely trusted their citizens to engage in personal social distancing, which they did.
[02:09:44.622 --> 02:09:46.644]  Now they have herd immunity almost.
[02:09:46.684 --> 02:09:48.205]  They haven't locked down their economy.
[02:09:48.926 --> 02:09:52.570]  People aren't going to die because of related reasons of poverty.
[02:09:53.448 --> 02:10:00.532]  And now Sweden has been the world's COVID-19 outlier, pursuing social distancing but rejecting mandatory lockdown.
[02:10:00.572 --> 02:10:09.256]  And the article goes through the fact that the R-rate is the same or lower than it is in the UK, which did lock down its entire economy.
[02:10:09.536 --> 02:10:17.960]  The death rate in Sweden is lower per capita than the UK's death rate, again, despite the fact that it followed diametrically opposite policy.
[02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:26.451]  The virus is shown to be spreading far faster in Sweden, not because the mortality trends are significantly different, but because no full lockdown has been ordered so far.
[02:10:27.072 --> 02:10:28.675]  So what did this imply for Sweden?
[02:10:29.276 --> 02:10:30.958]  Imperial did not translate the graph.
[02:10:30.978 --> 02:10:32.621]  They're talking about the UK model, of course.
[02:10:33.797 --> 02:10:51.727]  And they found that the latest figure for Sweden is 2,680 deaths, despite the fact that the initial model, based on the fact that Sweden didn't shut down, said that there'd be 40,000 COVID deaths in Sweden by May 1st and 100,000 by June.
[02:10:52.167 --> 02:10:52.888]  Didn't happen.
[02:10:53.208 --> 02:10:58.371]  They did have a higher death rate than other Scandinavian countries, but it was only 2,680 when this article was written.
[02:11:01.303 --> 02:11:09.010]  Their policy worked, they didn't destroy their economy, they didn't kill tens of hundreds of thousands of people, and now they can get back on track.
[02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:11.492]  They got it right, we got it drastically wrong.
[02:11:12.072 --> 02:11:13.493]  War Room coming up, don't go away.
[02:11:14.034 --> 02:11:14.854]  Summit.News.
[02:11:15.335 --> 02:11:18.217]  Something very exciting and positive has happened.
[02:11:19.318 --> 02:11:23.822]  The people of the United States, the people of the UK, the people of Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America,
[02:11:24.753 --> 02:11:25.533]  We're good to go.
[02:11:41.226 --> 02:11:54.862]  Now, a few months ago, when we were first exposing that, the media attacked us and said we were fake news, but then more and more citizens went out and documented it for themselves, when they would see a local press conference saying, we're here, there's lines around the block, there's, you know, body bags everywhere.
[02:11:55.183 --> 02:12:00.769]  People would drive, sometimes in a few minutes, and get there and show that it was almost completely empty and was a hoax.
[02:12:01.610 --> 02:12:09.177]  Project Veritas has now gotten insiders to come out, it's breaking today, and show how CBS staged one of these events.
[02:12:09.257 --> 02:12:11.619]  This is smoking gun information.
[02:12:11.959 --> 02:12:24.410]  Also, US Intel has come out and said that China has been caught hyping this and working with mainstream media and funding it, and they're afraid that they're going to try to break into the databases and inflate COVID numbers so we never reopen.
[02:12:24.910 --> 02:12:26.030]  It's now confirmed.
[02:12:26.070 --> 02:12:40.096]  This has been a CHICOM, Deep State, NIH, WHO operation to bring in panic, world government, and economic collapse, to bring the first world into submission, and to starve and depopulate the third world.
[02:12:40.116 --> 02:12:45.798]  So here is some of the highlights of this incredible Project Veritas report, and I'll be back with some final words.
[02:12:51.345 --> 02:13:09.446]  You're telling me, you're 100% certain that CBS News, CBS News Corporation, National, staged a fake event, they faked the news, they faked the reality, and broadcasted that to all of their audience last Friday on CBS This Morning?
[02:13:09.466 --> 02:13:10.908]  100%, absolutely.
[02:13:12.065 --> 02:13:18.548]  Only six states have reported more cases than Michigan, but fewer than 2% of its people have been tested for the virus.
[02:13:19.148 --> 02:13:27.211]  In our series on the state of coronavirus testing, Adriana Diaz shows how Michigan is trying to improve a system that has failed some of its people.
[02:13:27.631 --> 02:13:32.453]  But the governor says testing above all else will help determine when to fully reopen.
[02:13:32.693 --> 02:13:37.675]  Apparently, the news crew wanted
[02:13:39.329 --> 02:13:45.212]  Did she tell you guys, like, hey, you're not actually getting tested?
[02:13:45.332 --> 02:13:45.692]  Yeah.
[02:13:45.792 --> 02:13:47.213]  Yeah, she did.
[02:13:47.653 --> 02:13:49.814]  Just to make it look easy.
[02:14:03.658 --> 02:14:04.419]  That's crazy.
[02:14:05.139 --> 02:14:07.482]  Well, I didn't see you guys do the swab at all.
[02:14:07.502 --> 02:14:09.003]  I just saw you talking with them.
[02:14:09.203 --> 02:14:10.825]  And then I was talking with the other girl.
[02:14:11.605 --> 02:14:15.208]  Did you pretend it?
[02:14:15.569 --> 02:14:17.951]  There were a couple of real patients, which made it worse.
[02:14:17.991 --> 02:14:21.214]  I probably just wanted it to look busy.
[02:14:21.434 --> 02:14:22.215]  It's my guess.
[02:14:22.395 --> 02:14:24.417]  Is this the fake line?
[02:14:24.537 --> 02:14:24.857]  Yes.
[02:14:25.077 --> 02:14:25.678]  Yep.
[02:14:25.718 --> 02:14:26.379]  That's it.
[02:14:26.399 --> 02:14:28.701]  So the people in the cars are not patients?
[02:14:29.403 --> 02:14:30.224]  Majority of them.
[02:14:30.324 --> 02:14:43.744]  I do know from talking with the testers that one of them, one or two of them were real patients which added to their frustration because this line sat there for a while so they could organize the shot.
[02:14:46.547 --> 02:14:46.827]  Correct.
[02:14:46.867 --> 02:14:47.228]  Correct.
[02:14:47.288 --> 02:14:52.170]  You shouldn't be afraid to say the truth, because in the end, you know, truth always wins.
[02:15:01.331 --> 02:15:11.115]  As horrifying as this report is, the good news is grassroots journalists were the first to begin exposing this more than two months ago, and it shows the power of we the people.
[02:15:11.716 --> 02:15:17.238]  And I have friends and I have family that really thought COVID-19 was the end of the world and who really bought into the hype.
[02:15:17.558 --> 02:15:23.021]  But now they're seeing the numbers, and now they're seeing the medical doctors come out and expose the fact that it's not even as bad as the flu.
[02:15:23.661 --> 02:15:30.304]  And people are really beginning to understand what a monstrous Bill and Melinda Gates-financed hoax this has all been.
[02:15:31.277 --> 02:15:33.599]  But they're blocking Project Veritas on YouTube.
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:36.943]  They're blocking all of our videos on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[02:15:37.343 --> 02:15:39.506]  That's why this is posted at Banned.Video.
[02:15:39.806 --> 02:15:51.158]  And when you get excited and when you promote these banned videos, like the doctors that came out and exposed it as a hoax a few weeks ago that YouTube banned, we mirrored it and it got over a million views at Banned.Video.
[02:15:52.259 --> 02:16:00.982]  The next part of this equation is you taking action and sharing this video on your email, on your Twitter, on your Facebook, on your YouTube, and by word of mouth.
[02:16:01.142 --> 02:16:04.503]  Don't let these criminals continue to operate like this.
[02:16:04.563 --> 02:16:05.483]  They think you're stupid.
[02:16:05.523 --> 02:16:06.623]  They think I'm stupid.
[02:16:06.824 --> 02:16:07.824]  They think we're weak.
[02:16:08.104 --> 02:16:12.025]  They think they can override us and tell these incredible lies and stage these events.
[02:16:12.505 --> 02:16:14.526]  But they're not going to be able to do it.
[02:16:15.106 --> 02:16:32.561]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, they are taking all the normal deaths of heart attacks, cancer, pneumonia, and putting it in the column of COVID-19 to jack up the numbers because they want to be able to have this lockdown so President Trump and President Balassaro and others lose to repudiate nationalism.
[02:16:32.861 --> 02:16:36.044]  They admitted they wanted a global depression to stop Donald Trump.
[02:16:36.829 --> 02:16:41.610]  And now they're close to doing it, but not close enough because we the people are taking action.
[02:16:41.850 --> 02:16:44.591]  So spread this video now like you've never had before.
[02:16:44.951 --> 02:16:46.932]  And I salute you and I thank you.
[02:16:57.135 --> 02:16:58.835]  All right, John Rappaport back here.
[02:17:00.255 --> 02:17:03.256]  So why would they fake reality?
[02:17:04.697 --> 02:17:05.997]  Because they don't have the numbers.
[02:17:07.625 --> 02:17:09.026]  Because they don't have reality.
[02:17:09.927 --> 02:17:13.330]  I mean, that's why you fake it when you don't have it.
[02:17:14.331 --> 02:17:16.673]  If you don't have it, you need to fake it.
[02:17:17.613 --> 02:17:24.920]  This is what I've been saying and writing for the past three months, day and night, day and night, day and night.
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:36.109]  Why do you think it's the 80-year-olds and the 70-year-olds and the 95-year-olds, they're saying, oh, yeah, it was a COVID death, a COVID death, a COVID death.
[02:17:36.823 --> 02:17:43.648]  Yeah, he fell off a cliff and on the way down we tested him and he was positive, so he's a COVID death.
[02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:46.690]  Because they don't have the numbers.
[02:17:47.671 --> 02:17:48.752]  Because it doesn't add up.
[02:17:48.852 --> 02:17:50.093]  Because it doesn't make sense.
[02:17:51.894 --> 02:17:55.136]  They've been doing this with flu and pneumonia for decades.
[02:17:57.038 --> 02:18:01.321]  CDC putting flu and pneumonia in the same category in the year 2001.
[02:18:03.149 --> 02:18:07.511]  As was exposed in the BMJ, British Medical Journal, online.
[02:18:08.451 --> 02:18:12.113]  If you took down the number of actual flu deaths in the U.S.
[02:18:12.733 --> 02:18:17.455]  that you could confirm by finding the virus with a test, you got 18.
[02:18:17.915 --> 02:18:19.596]  Not 36,000.
[02:18:21.016 --> 02:18:21.997]  Friggin' 18!
[02:18:23.577 --> 02:18:24.498]  Oh, he couldn't be right.
[02:18:24.518 --> 02:18:25.278]  That's ridiculous.
[02:18:25.298 --> 02:18:26.198]  That would never happen.
[02:18:26.718 --> 02:18:30.060]  Yeah, well, you've been fooled again.
[02:18:30.845 --> 02:18:31.645]  That's all I can say.
[02:18:31.705 --> 02:18:33.226]  You've been fooled again.
[02:18:34.346 --> 02:18:36.367]  All these numbers are concocted.
[02:18:38.788 --> 02:18:39.548]  Flu numbers.
[02:18:40.888 --> 02:18:41.789]  COVID numbers.
[02:18:42.909 --> 02:18:43.269]  Why?
[02:18:43.309 --> 02:18:48.071]  Because they don't have enough numbers that they can blame on a virus.
[02:18:48.891 --> 02:18:53.672]  Because if they can blame it on a virus, they can tell you you've got to have a vaccine.
[02:18:54.953 --> 02:18:55.253]  Get it?
[02:18:57.105 --> 02:19:03.807]  And so this is what this guy, Neil Ferguson, was there for at the Imperial College of London.
[02:19:04.827 --> 02:19:11.848]  Tens of millions of dollars go into the Institute from Bill Gates, that is, Ferguson's Institute.
[02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:26.752]  And he is the computer modeler that makes the dire predictions that this psychopath that you're looking at on the screen, Bill Gates, can now use to say, we have to shoot everybody up on the planet.
[02:19:27.403 --> 02:19:30.825]  With a COVID vaccine before we can end the lockdowns.
[02:19:34.428 --> 02:19:35.388]  I mean, wow.
[02:19:37.209 --> 02:19:43.874]  That's very much, in fact, it's exactly like saying we have to destroy the village in order to save it.
[02:19:45.034 --> 02:19:45.755]  Remember that one?
[02:19:48.216 --> 02:19:51.378]  We have to destroy the village in order to save it.
[02:19:52.239 --> 02:19:56.982]  That's what these psychopaths and sociopaths like Gates believe.
[02:19:58.749 --> 02:19:59.769]  We have to start over.
[02:20:00.430 --> 02:20:04.571]  Humanity is flawed, but we're the engineers.
[02:20:04.691 --> 02:20:14.455]  We can create a perfect technocracy with wall-to-wall surveillance to the Chinese model, as Alex was talking about, and we can impose that on the entire world.
[02:20:15.115 --> 02:20:19.916]  But in order to do that, we have to destroy what we've got in front of us.
[02:20:21.417 --> 02:20:27.039]  So, in the succeeding segment, I will go chapter and verse
[02:20:27.643 --> 02:20:56.259]  On Neil Ferguson's past failed predictions, where if people were paying attention, anybody, doesn't have to be Trump, Fauci, Boris Johnson, anybody in any public health status as a bureaucrat was paying attention to what Ferguson has predicted in the past, they would say, well, at best, this guy should be modeling the number of cockroaches in motel
[02:20:57.537 --> 02:20:57.997]  That's it.
[02:20:59.358 --> 02:21:02.541]  And that's it for the moment, but stay because you're going to want to hear this.
[02:21:02.621 --> 02:21:04.022]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:21:04.722 --> 02:21:13.589]  John Rappaport back, sitting here, looking at the track record of Neil Ferguson, which I'm going to go into now.
[02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:17.412]  But this is why it's important for you to know this.
[02:21:18.893 --> 02:21:24.137]  Because it's how you've been tricked, scammed, lied to, cheated, etc.
[02:21:26.358 --> 02:21:26.899]  Bill Gates.
[02:21:27.984 --> 02:21:31.285]  His money goes to the Institute at Imperial College in London.
[02:21:32.606 --> 02:21:38.968]  That Institute is run by Neil Ferguson, a scientist, computer modeler.
[02:21:41.309 --> 02:21:52.093]  Neil Ferguson comes up with a computer model saying huge numbers of deaths in the UK and US and by implication everywhere else unless we lock down.
[02:21:53.394 --> 02:21:53.794]  Prediction.
[02:21:56.001 --> 02:22:04.488]  Neil Ferguson has a direct line into the World Health Organization, which of course is also heavily funded and basically owned by Bill Gates.
[02:22:06.330 --> 02:22:11.534]  So Ferguson tells the CDC, World Health Organization, here's what's going to happen.
[02:22:12.335 --> 02:22:13.536]  Here's the horror story.
[02:22:15.317 --> 02:22:19.181]  He's talking for Bill Gates, basically, because he's funded by Bill Gates.
[02:22:19.941 --> 02:22:22.864]  And he's giving the justification and the rationale
[02:22:23.413 --> 02:22:27.996]  for a COVID vaccine worldwide, which is the plan, the Bill Gates plan.
[02:22:29.257 --> 02:22:31.839]  Horrible number of deaths unless we lock down.
[02:22:32.600 --> 02:22:35.462]  Can't end lockdown until vaccine.
[02:22:36.022 --> 02:22:36.503]  Got it?
[02:22:38.644 --> 02:22:48.031]  CDC, World Health Organization, go to governments like the UK, like US, France, Germany, et cetera, et cetera, and say, okay,
[02:22:49.750 --> 02:22:53.631]  If you don't want millions of deaths on your head, you gotta lock down the country.
[02:22:54.872 --> 02:22:56.112]  Gotta lock down the country.
[02:22:57.712 --> 02:23:10.576]  And excuse me for suggesting that political and mathematical idiots run these countries, but they do.
[02:23:11.237 --> 02:23:12.637]  Because they don't ask questions.
[02:23:12.857 --> 02:23:15.318]  Because they don't say what you or I would say.
[02:23:16.894 --> 02:23:18.034]  Who's the modeler?
[02:23:18.535 --> 02:23:20.115]  Who made the predictions?
[02:23:21.416 --> 02:23:22.856]  What's his track record?
[02:23:23.857 --> 02:23:40.983]  Why should I just take your word for it and lock down an entire country and bring the economy to a standstill because you are standing in front of me in my office and claiming that millions of people are going to die?
[02:23:42.603 --> 02:23:43.984]  But no, they don't do that.
[02:23:44.795 --> 02:23:47.917]  They just say, well, okay, I guess that's what we have to do.
[02:23:49.438 --> 02:23:50.239]  Morons.
[02:23:50.859 --> 02:23:51.320]  Idiots.
[02:23:52.641 --> 02:23:53.041]  Okay.
[02:23:54.042 --> 02:23:55.803]  Here's the man's track record.
[02:23:58.985 --> 02:23:55.803]  2001.
[02:24:00.066 --> 02:24:09.253]  Ferguson, in a computer model, predicted 150,000 people could die from mad cow disease in the UK.
[02:24:11.246 --> 02:24:16.689]  Causing the destruction of six million animals in the UK.
[02:24:19.470 --> 02:24:20.050]  Think about that.
[02:24:20.350 --> 02:24:21.011]  Six million.
[02:24:23.732 --> 02:24:28.534]  And according to official stats anyway, in the end, 150,000 people that died, 200 people died.
[02:24:28.574 --> 02:24:29.235]  Six million animals.
[02:24:37.512 --> 02:24:44.214]  Are you ready to wake up tomorrow and say, hey, let's kill six hundred and six million cows and sheep?
[02:24:45.715 --> 02:24:45.975]  That was 2001.
[02:24:48.216 --> 02:24:51.257]  Now, Biggie came in 2005 with bird flu.
[02:24:52.317 --> 02:24:57.739]  When Ferguson predicted, get this, 200 million people could die.
[02:24:59.500 --> 02:24:59.800]  Right.
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:06.202]  The official real number when it was over in the low hundreds.
[02:25:08.496 --> 02:25:10.036]  That's a Sky's Track record!
[02:25:11.117 --> 02:25:13.137]  Now, pay attention.
[02:25:13.177 --> 02:25:13.977]  Don't go to sleep.
[02:25:14.517 --> 02:25:15.838]  Don't cop out on me.
[02:25:16.258 --> 02:25:16.678]  Listen.
[02:25:19.738 --> 02:25:30.421]  This bird flu model was the same basic computer structure model that Ferguson used in 2020 to predict COVID deaths.
[02:25:32.121 --> 02:25:34.702]  He said 200 million could die from bird flu in 2005.
[02:25:36.562 --> 02:25:39.184]  And the final official count was in the low hundreds.
[02:25:41.625 --> 02:25:50.651]  Then in 2009, swine flu predicted 65,000 people could die in the UK, and the final figure was below 500.
[02:25:50.691 --> 02:25:55.014]  Got it?
[02:25:58.116 --> 02:26:03.279]  This is the A-hole, the criminal scientist.
[02:26:04.906 --> 02:26:11.711]  Who is praised to the sky as a genius and whatever that all these governments are following.
[02:26:13.372 --> 02:26:14.873]  He's funded by Bill Gates.
[02:26:16.094 --> 02:26:19.697]  Bill Gates wants the lockdown.
[02:26:20.638 --> 02:26:24.901]  Ferguson provides the rationale for the lockdown.
[02:26:25.721 --> 02:26:28.103]  The countries are locked down.
[02:26:28.583 --> 02:26:30.685]  Economies are destroyed.
[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:40.446]  People become robots walking down the street in masks and gloves like idiots everywhere.
[02:26:40.466 --> 02:26:45.169]  And the whole thing is a fake.
[02:26:48.211 --> 02:26:49.953]  I said it was a fake from the beginning.
[02:26:51.614 --> 02:26:54.676]  I said the whole point was the vaccine from the beginning.
[02:26:56.037 --> 02:26:57.758]  I said everything else was a fake.
[02:26:59.722 --> 02:27:02.363]  I've said they were all fakes since 1987.
[02:27:02.423 --> 02:27:07.945]  I've investigated fake epidemics for 30 years.
[02:27:11.226 --> 02:27:20.329]  Eventually, people come around when they see the devastation, the economic devastation that is being brought in the name of a virus.
[02:27:21.930 --> 02:27:24.571]  And they begin to ask questions because they have to.
[02:27:26.392 --> 02:27:27.272]  Because they have to.
[02:27:28.334 --> 02:27:36.976]  Because they say, should I sacrifice myself on the altar of saving my next-door neighbor from a virus I don't even know whether I have?
[02:27:39.196 --> 02:27:41.057]  I don't even know whether it exists?
[02:27:41.997 --> 02:27:45.318]  I don't even know how the test works or whether it's any good?
[02:27:45.338 --> 02:27:47.898]  Is that what you're asking me to do?
[02:27:47.918 --> 02:27:50.959]  To lose my job?
[02:27:51.459 --> 02:27:53.900]  To lose my livelihood?
[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:56.040]  To go bankrupt?
[02:27:57.566 --> 02:28:03.628]  To sacrifice myself on the altar of insane psychopaths?
[02:28:06.148 --> 02:28:07.349]  Is that what you want from me?
[02:28:07.369 --> 02:28:10.850]  I don't think so.
[02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:17.131]  I just have a sneaky feeling it's probably not the right thing to do.
[02:28:17.251 --> 02:28:19.172]  You know what I mean, listeners, viewers?
[02:28:21.273 --> 02:28:22.453]  You get where I'm going with this?
[02:28:23.513 --> 02:28:26.054]  It's probably not the right thing to do to say
[02:28:26.812 --> 02:28:34.777]  Well, gee, if you want me to sacrifice myself for all of that, I guess maybe I will.
[02:28:34.957 --> 02:28:36.718]  Okay, sure, whatever.
[02:28:37.899 --> 02:28:41.781]  I'll become a robot, a pod person, if that's what you want.
[02:28:42.182 --> 02:28:50.927]  You know those ads, I won't name the company, that show somebody like jumping into a pit of fire because supposedly
[02:28:51.584 --> 02:29:02.431]  The rain is going to come through a ceremony by which, you know, they keep sacrificing people and the rain doesn't show up and the idiots keep sacrificing people.
[02:29:04.813 --> 02:29:06.394]  That's what I mean when I say fake.
[02:29:07.755 --> 02:29:09.276]  That's what I mean when I say fake.
[02:29:11.497 --> 02:29:12.798]  It was fake from the beginning.
[02:29:13.755 --> 02:29:15.056]  It was fake in Wuhan.
[02:29:15.096 --> 02:29:16.196]  It was fake in Italy.
[02:29:16.216 --> 02:29:19.037]  It was fake in other Chinese cities.
[02:29:19.577 --> 02:29:21.738]  The whole thing was based on a fake.
[02:29:22.218 --> 02:29:37.505]  And I'll go into it as we wind down on this segment as to how the whole thing was faked from the beginning and why that was, if you were a criminal sociopath, the best way to do this by fake.
[02:29:38.205 --> 02:29:38.745]  There it is.
[02:29:39.805 --> 02:29:40.966]  Rather than by
[02:29:42.037 --> 02:29:43.958]  an actual virus.
[02:29:45.018 --> 02:29:46.239]  Fake is much easier.
[02:29:46.519 --> 02:29:47.900]  John Appleport back here.
[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:55.463]  So before I get into more of the fakery, let's just get another thing straight here.
[02:29:55.603 --> 02:30:03.947]  Just between us, why do we need to obey people who say we must obey?
[02:30:05.327 --> 02:30:06.588]  Isn't that always a question?
[02:30:07.828 --> 02:30:11.510]  In other words, when you look at people like Bill Gates and Fauci and so forth,
[02:30:12.554 --> 02:30:15.795]  You say, well, who appointed them God?
[02:30:17.396 --> 02:30:28.960]  Such that if they say, we have to stay home, we can't do business, we can't open up businesses, we can't walk out on the street and live our lives, then we have to go along with that.
[02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:30.420]  We just simply do.
[02:30:31.761 --> 02:30:32.501]  No, we don't.
[02:30:33.982 --> 02:30:34.722]  No, we don't.
[02:30:37.623 --> 02:30:37.943]  Why?
[02:30:40.290 --> 02:30:46.974]  Well, because if we tell you to commit economic suicide, you just have to do it in the service of a greater cause.
[02:30:47.054 --> 02:30:47.634]  No, we don't.
[02:30:49.075 --> 02:30:51.356]  No, absolutely not.
[02:30:53.597 --> 02:30:58.220]  So there's the level of protests, and we see more and more protests across the country.
[02:30:58.860 --> 02:30:59.241]  Yes.
[02:31:00.601 --> 02:31:07.025]  But there's also the level of people opening up their lives again, individually.
[02:31:07.771 --> 02:31:13.356]  Companies reopening, people saying, I got to do business or I'm going to die.
[02:31:15.717 --> 02:31:21.502]  There's a certain level of economic activity called making a living.
[02:31:22.323 --> 02:31:24.905]  Have you bastards ever heard of that before?
[02:31:25.525 --> 02:31:34.793]  You whose paychecks are secure, who are living out in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., have security, etc., etc.
[02:31:36.909 --> 02:31:38.929]  Yes, I can work at home.
[02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:44.491]  It's a bit of a sacrifice, but you know, we'll all get through this together.
[02:31:45.151 --> 02:31:46.411]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[02:31:48.271 --> 02:31:48.671]  Really?
[02:31:49.432 --> 02:31:49.752]  Really?
[02:31:50.952 --> 02:31:55.853]  These are the people that we're going to go down in history as having obeyed?
[02:31:55.873 --> 02:31:55.913]  No.
[02:32:00.074 --> 02:32:05.955]  So there's a level of protest, but then there's also the level of just opening up life.
[02:32:07.571 --> 02:32:08.812]  Gotta go get stuff.
[02:32:09.692 --> 02:32:10.892]  Gotta do business.
[02:32:12.313 --> 02:32:15.695]  People are going to do it.
[02:32:16.315 --> 02:32:17.355]  They are doing it.
[02:32:18.216 --> 02:32:19.356]  They should do it.
[02:32:21.297 --> 02:32:22.998]  Oh, but what about the fear of the virus?
[02:32:23.018 --> 02:32:23.998]  The fear of the virus?
[02:32:24.038 --> 02:32:25.059]  The fear of the virus?
[02:32:25.899 --> 02:32:32.422]  No, it's the fear of having an opinion that runs contrary to what you're supposed to believe.
[02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:50.423]  It's the state religion that's preaching to you night and day saying, we're the ones who have the answers and you have to pray to us and get down on your freaking knees and in abject worship of what we say.
[02:32:50.863 --> 02:32:51.664]  No, you don't.
[02:32:52.284 --> 02:32:53.144]  No, you don't.
[02:32:53.624 --> 02:32:54.644]  No, we don't.
[02:32:57.445 --> 02:33:00.025]  No, we're not all in this together.
[02:33:00.545 --> 02:33:03.546]  The robots are, but we're not the robots.
[02:33:06.109 --> 02:33:06.929]  Do business.
[02:33:07.269 --> 02:33:08.190]  Open up life.
[02:33:08.910 --> 02:33:10.050]  Bring back life.
[02:33:13.212 --> 02:33:20.414]  Don't listen to what self-appointed authorities tell you you have to believe.
[02:33:21.455 --> 02:33:23.655]  That used to be a cornerstone of education.
[02:33:24.316 --> 02:33:27.437]  That supposedly used to be a cornerstone of the press.
[02:33:28.877 --> 02:33:32.298]  Now the press are the pod people that just go along.
[02:33:33.559 --> 02:33:33.819]  Okay.
[02:33:36.545 --> 02:33:51.714]  So I've been, I guess you could say, questioned because, oh, maybe as a reporter I've gone too far because I've said, well, convince me that they ever discovered a new virus in the first place in Wuhan.
[02:33:53.235 --> 02:33:54.516]  No, that's not going too far.
[02:33:54.556 --> 02:33:56.297]  That's not even going far enough.
[02:33:57.177 --> 02:33:58.218]  But let's go there.
[02:33:59.839 --> 02:34:01.660]  Well, how did they discover a new virus?
[02:34:02.300 --> 02:34:03.121]  I don't know.
[02:34:04.042 --> 02:34:09.404]  So, in other words, because you don't know, it must be true that they did?
[02:34:09.424 --> 02:34:13.125]  Is that an equation you're happy with?
[02:34:13.786 --> 02:34:14.586]  I don't know.
[02:34:15.086 --> 02:34:18.287]  Therefore, they must have discovered a new virus?
[02:34:18.447 --> 02:34:19.328]  I don't think so.
[02:34:19.348 --> 02:34:21.389]  I don't think so.
[02:34:22.929 --> 02:34:31.392]  Now, I've gone into this in great detail in articles, so I'm not going to try to lay out the entire nine yards here.
[02:34:31.892 --> 02:34:33.133]  I'm simply going to say,
[02:34:35.262 --> 02:34:51.212]  That the discovery of a virus by traditional, the most reasonable methods would have involved, and you see my article up there, two vital experiments that have never been done, the use of electron microscopes in a real study.
[02:34:51.612 --> 02:34:54.454]  Not, oh we got this picture here, oh we got that, no.
[02:34:54.474 --> 02:34:56.915]  500 patients, 1,000 patients, 2,000 patients,
[02:35:00.071 --> 02:35:08.174]  With proper procedure ending up with, say, a thousand side-by-side photographs taken under electron microscope.
[02:35:08.734 --> 02:35:20.559]  And the question, do we see many, many particles of a virus that we've never seen before in all of these photographs from the 1,000 patients that are supposed to have this new disease?
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:28.762]  Do all the particles look the same from picture to picture, picture to picture?
[02:35:30.396 --> 02:35:37.041]  And are they all really viral particles that we've never seen before such that we can say there's a new virus?
[02:35:38.522 --> 02:35:42.065]  You show me they've done that, I'll drink the Kool-Aid.
[02:35:42.725 --> 02:35:43.286]  They haven't.
[02:35:43.546 --> 02:35:44.346]  They never will.
[02:35:44.807 --> 02:35:45.707]  They don't want to.
[02:35:46.088 --> 02:35:50.611]  They're afraid because the result is not going to show what they claim to show.
[02:35:51.532 --> 02:35:55.114]  That is my computer prediction.
[02:35:57.256 --> 02:35:58.597]  And in the absence of that,
[02:35:59.464 --> 02:36:12.730]  All the fumbling and bumbling and stumbling in the lab with molecular this and that and the nucleotides and the sequences and this and that and the other thing are just so much technical nonsense.
[02:36:14.811 --> 02:36:19.153]  And if you can't prove that you ever discovered a new virus, then what are we talking about?
[02:36:20.593 --> 02:36:24.695]  How are you going to test for a virus that you never really discovered?
[02:36:26.031 --> 02:36:29.533]  Spits out false positives like there's no tomorrow.
[02:36:30.473 --> 02:36:41.398]  The PCR test that registers positive meaning you're infected because of irrelevant germs.
[02:36:41.958 --> 02:36:48.381]  Many different possible germs that have nothing to do with a purported COVID germ.
[02:36:49.898 --> 02:36:57.963]  That get in and register falsely positive, and then they say, oh, I'm sorry, but you have the virus.
[02:36:59.524 --> 02:37:02.927]  Oh, and you must believe us because we did the test.
[02:37:05.268 --> 02:37:11.252]  Fakery, fakery, fakery, fakery, all the way along the line.
[02:37:11.632 --> 02:37:18.617]  From the discovery of the virus, to the fake tests, to the fake case numbers based on the tests,
[02:37:20.063 --> 02:37:20.483]  Come on.
[02:37:21.804 --> 02:37:22.204]  Come on.
[02:37:24.705 --> 02:37:41.652]  I mean, it stands to reason that they would use a few actors in a hospital setting with hazmat suits just to pump up the fakery given the enormous size of the actual fakery scientific from the beginning.
[02:37:42.592 --> 02:37:48.375]  And when you think about it, faking the whole thing is their best option because they can control
[02:37:49.474 --> 02:37:52.935]  The story about a virus, which is what they're selling.
[02:37:53.456 --> 02:37:55.316]  They're not selling a virus.
[02:37:55.837 --> 02:38:00.898]  They're selling a story about a virus and that's what people have been buying.
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:05.800]  Why buy it?
[02:38:08.441 --> 02:38:17.525]  I mean, it occurs to me, and I'm sure it occurs to you, that there was once something called freedom in this country and liberty.
[02:38:18.109 --> 02:38:26.855]  And that people actually fought and died for it, not just in this country, but in Europe for many, many centuries.
[02:38:29.297 --> 02:38:29.717]  Why?
[02:38:29.857 --> 02:38:32.759]  Because they knew that freedom was an inherent thing.
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:34.681]  Liberty was an inherent thing.
[02:38:35.221 --> 02:38:35.902]  They knew it.
[02:38:35.962 --> 02:38:36.662]  They felt it.
[02:38:36.722 --> 02:38:37.623]  They wanted it.
[02:38:38.464 --> 02:38:41.466]  And so they fought for it in every way that they could.
[02:38:43.807 --> 02:38:46.089]  I mean, doesn't that sound reasonable?
[02:38:48.206 --> 02:38:49.326]  Doesn't it sound reasonable?
[02:38:50.107 --> 02:39:07.431]  And doesn't it sound reasonable that when they're talking about the necessity of a lockdown in such casual terms as through the summer, into the fall, until we have a vaccine, that they're completely out of their friggin' minds?
[02:39:08.672 --> 02:39:16.054]  A bunch of criminal sociopaths whom we should reject in the name of freedom and liberty and instead live our lives?
[02:39:17.287 --> 02:39:24.571]  Doesn't that seem eminently reasonable, given our need and desire for freedom?
[02:39:24.591 --> 02:39:29.614]  It's John Rappaport in the final segment here at InfoWars.
[02:39:34.017 --> 02:39:41.462]  You think about your own freedom, your own life, how much it means to you.
[02:39:41.482 --> 02:39:46.945]  You think about the lives of other people who value freedom.
[02:39:49.602 --> 02:40:12.459]  Who would want to walk out on the street, live their lives, make a living, and then you think about the shutdown, the lockdown, as a preparation for a universal vaccine brought to you by Bill Gates as your passport out of jail.
[02:40:16.742 --> 02:40:18.543]  Your passport out of jail.
[02:40:21.348 --> 02:40:26.310]  And this is the man who, what, runs the world?
[02:40:26.970 --> 02:40:27.630]  I don't think so.
[02:40:29.551 --> 02:40:31.231]  He may think he's gonna run the world.
[02:40:32.352 --> 02:40:33.072]  It's not gonna happen.
[02:40:36.153 --> 02:40:44.496]  Do you seriously think that if the lockdown were extended for, let's say, the next eight months, that people would sit still and just go for it?
[02:40:45.216 --> 02:40:48.358]  That they would just stay home and die in huge numbers?
[02:40:48.898 --> 02:40:49.498]  I don't think so.
[02:40:51.138 --> 02:41:08.007]  I think it's already that we're seeing the tide turning as more of us go out and live the way free people would live because the story about the virus does not sell.
[02:41:11.228 --> 02:41:18.492]  It's a story meant to keep people locked down and of course you can see how well it works because people are easily hypnotized.
[02:41:19.648 --> 02:41:22.610]  And some people want to be hypnotized, it turns out.
[02:41:23.130 --> 02:41:25.412]  A lot of people want to be hypnotized.
[02:41:26.112 --> 02:41:28.013]  They want to serve the dictator.
[02:41:28.534 --> 02:41:30.415]  They want to submit to the dictator.
[02:41:30.835 --> 02:41:38.200]  They want to lie down and kiss the dictator's feet and swear allegiance to the dictator.
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:44.784]  They want to help the dictator enforce the dictator's edicts and laws.
[02:41:45.305 --> 02:41:47.126]  They want to do whatever they can.
[02:41:48.798 --> 02:41:52.799]  And they think at the same time they're doing that, they're doing good.
[02:41:55.099 --> 02:42:01.380]  Some dude named Plato pointed that out a long time ago, that people always think they're doing good.
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:02.761]  Sure!
[02:42:04.641 --> 02:42:09.622]  I'm destroying lives on behalf of the dictator, and that's a good thing.
[02:42:11.382 --> 02:42:11.822]  Isn't it?
[02:42:13.922 --> 02:42:14.223]  Yeah.
[02:42:15.623 --> 02:42:16.823]  You run into those people.
[02:42:17.858 --> 02:42:20.519]  You get closer than six feet, they give you that hostile look.
[02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:23.661]  They're going to line right up for the shot.
[02:42:24.842 --> 02:42:33.847]  Can I get in front so I can get this vaccine delivered into me with synthetic genes so it alters my genetic makeup forever?
[02:42:33.867 --> 02:42:41.631]  I want to be the first in line to be completely changed.
[02:42:43.753 --> 02:42:44.633]  Completely changed.
[02:42:47.841 --> 02:42:49.461]  That's what people are hoping for.
[02:42:52.062 --> 02:42:54.623]  So desperate that they want to be changed.
[02:42:55.383 --> 02:43:01.965]  So if you tell them, hey, they're going to inject you with genes, it's going to alter your genetic makeup in ways that they can't even predict.
[02:43:02.705 --> 02:43:04.385]  And who knows how it's all going to turn out.
[02:43:04.445 --> 02:43:05.966]  They say, man, give it to me.
[02:43:06.086 --> 02:43:10.367]  I need it because I can't stand my life the way it is now.
[02:43:10.927 --> 02:43:12.848]  And I'll do anything to get out of it.
[02:43:13.588 --> 02:43:14.428]  That's another motive.
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:19.000]  And then there's just love your master.
[02:43:20.981 --> 02:43:31.583]  But people who want freedom and liberty and who know what it is to get pissed off for the right reasons don't want that.
[02:43:33.723 --> 02:43:44.865]  They want to live their lives without any hindrance, without any dictatorial restraint.
[02:43:47.165 --> 02:43:50.706]  Just like it said in the foundational documents.
[02:43:52.367 --> 02:43:53.087]  Just like that.
[02:43:57.249 --> 02:44:15.895]  So what we've been watching over the last, you could say 100 years, but let's say the last 40 real, is the rise of the medical dictatorship because that's the avenue along which the globalists and technocrats realize that they can sell the right story.
[02:44:17.301 --> 02:44:18.361]  That's what they're doing.
[02:44:19.502 --> 02:44:24.983]  They can't exactly sell the story of left versus right or anything political.
[02:44:25.424 --> 02:44:36.947]  They sell the guy in the green scrubs wearing the mask with the scalpel and the needle and the charts on the wall and the PCR test and the virus.
[02:44:37.327 --> 02:44:39.128]  They know how to sell that crap.
[02:44:40.028 --> 02:44:41.208]  They're experts at it.
[02:44:41.488 --> 02:44:46.230]  And believe me when I tell you that I've looked into
[02:44:47.472 --> 02:44:50.213]  They're doing the last 35 years.
[02:44:52.534 --> 02:45:11.202]  And I'm talking about the ones who do the basic research, the liars, scumbags, psychopaths, the ones who sell their souls completely for the sake of position, prestige, power, some cases, not even money.
[02:45:13.843 --> 02:45:16.044]  And that's all they're doing is selling a story.
[02:45:17.486 --> 02:45:18.447]  That's all they're doing.
[02:45:19.227 --> 02:45:21.209]  And they're looking for buyers all the time.
[02:45:22.009 --> 02:45:23.971]  They've been looking for buyers all the time.
[02:45:25.892 --> 02:45:30.516]  They've hypnotized themselves into becoming true believers in their own cause.
[02:45:33.638 --> 02:45:36.821]  And so they've become the evil ones.
[02:45:39.362 --> 02:45:39.783]  The evil ones.
[02:45:42.725 --> 02:45:45.267]  I was on a show not too long ago where the host said,
[02:45:46.311 --> 02:45:58.983]  You know, it occurs to me that if the media had never covered this whole thing, starting in Wuhan, that there would be nothing except a flu season, another flu season, whatever that is.
[02:46:00.424 --> 02:46:03.527]  And we would just go on with our lives, which is absolutely the truth.
[02:46:04.568 --> 02:46:05.569]  That's what it would have been.
[02:46:06.830 --> 02:46:10.233]  This whole thing is synthetic, artificial, fabricated.
[02:46:15.285 --> 02:46:19.526]  The building of prison bars to keep people inside.
[02:46:20.706 --> 02:46:21.606]  That's what it is.
[02:46:25.387 --> 02:46:37.869]  Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda, once said, it's possible to influence a million people, but impossible to change the mind of one man.
[02:46:37.889 --> 02:46:41.070]  What does that mean?
[02:46:41.130 --> 02:46:42.570]  That means that the individual
[02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:48.934]  And his own consciousness can resist any kind of brainwashing or thought control.
[02:46:50.876 --> 02:47:01.964]  Whereas people who want to be lumped in together in a group are easily hypnotizable as long as they have that group think and group consciousness.
[02:47:03.061 --> 02:47:09.506]  Which recent generations have grown up with, thinking that it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[02:47:09.886 --> 02:47:11.547]  The group, the group, the group, the group!
[02:47:11.607 --> 02:47:13.088]  Give me more of the group, the group!
[02:47:13.469 --> 02:47:20.374]  Not realizing that the globalists want to have society composed of groups.
[02:47:21.374 --> 02:47:25.557]  Not individuals, because groups can be easily influenced and hypnotized.
[02:47:27.519 --> 02:47:30.281]  With talk about care, concern, love.
[02:47:30.814 --> 02:47:34.075]  We'll all get through this together, rainbows and all that.
[02:47:35.056 --> 02:47:39.198]  I'm having a very tough time, I need to tell you, in the last couple minutes here.
[02:47:39.718 --> 02:47:45.540]  Restraining myself from using language that, I don't know, will probably get us kicked off the air.
[02:47:45.581 --> 02:47:54.184]  I'm not sure, but... Live free.
[02:47:55.625 --> 02:47:56.225]  Live free.
[02:47:56.285 --> 02:47:57.386]  That's the whole idea.
[02:47:57.406 --> 02:48:00.167]  They can't tell you
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:01.400]  What to do?
[02:48:03.341 --> 02:48:05.082]  Unless you buy their story.
[02:48:07.403 --> 02:48:08.884]  They don't have the science.
[02:48:09.485 --> 02:48:10.345]  They never did.
[02:48:11.866 --> 02:48:14.987]  This isn't about good science.
[02:48:17.129 --> 02:48:20.810]  It's about fake science, and it was since the beginning.
[02:48:25.453 --> 02:48:29.495]  The case numbers, I'm afraid, are meaningless, folks.
[02:48:30.763 --> 02:48:42.850]  I mean, when I say meaningless, I mean meaningless because they're based on tests that are useless and worthless and spit out false positives like there's no tomorrow.
[02:48:43.651 --> 02:48:46.573]  Or they're based on no tests at all, just lying.
[02:48:47.093 --> 02:48:54.878]  Let's put COVID on the form because the hospital, as you saw in a previous episode here, needs more money.
[02:48:54.938 --> 02:48:58.420]  And if we put COVID down, we get more insurance money.
[02:49:00.097 --> 02:49:06.543]  So through outright lying, fakery, etc., etc., the case numbers are all developed, broadcast.
[02:49:07.123 --> 02:49:12.328]  People spend their time poring over these case numbers and claiming this, that.
[02:49:12.428 --> 02:49:13.749]  They're all meaningless!
[02:49:13.769 --> 02:49:17.312]  I mean, it's just like garbage.
[02:49:17.873 --> 02:49:23.978]  You just open your garbage can and say, oh, that's where the numbers are, and shut the lid and forget about it.
[02:49:24.939 --> 02:49:25.139]  Right?
[02:49:29.019 --> 02:49:34.943]  This society has been trained to obey and think that obedience is love.
[02:49:39.066 --> 02:49:39.507]  It's not.
[02:49:40.327 --> 02:49:41.008]  Never was.
[02:49:41.828 --> 02:49:42.569]  Never will be.
[02:49:44.430 --> 02:49:47.112]  Might be masochism, but it ain't love, baby.
[02:49:49.133 --> 02:49:51.595]  All right, that's me for today.
[02:49:51.655 --> 02:49:53.296]  Sitting in for Alex, I thank you.
[02:49:53.797 --> 02:49:55.358]  John Rappaport, see you next time.
[02:50:07.119 --> 02:50:10.383]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[02:50:10.823 --> 02:50:13.125]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[02:50:13.205 --> 02:50:13.946]  What's coming.
[02:50:14.747 --> 02:50:15.188]  Banned.
[02:50:15.808 --> 02:50:16.249]  Video.
[02:50:16.329 --> 02:50:16.569]  Banned.
[02:50:16.609 --> 02:50:17.110]  Video.
[02:50:21.574 --> 02:50:23.616]  We've known this was coming for a long time.
[02:50:24.858 --> 02:50:25.819]  The Club of Rome.
[02:50:26.359 --> 02:50:27.480]  Stay Apart Memorandum 200.
[02:50:29.833 --> 02:50:58.998]  And hundreds of other documents like Lockstep from 2010 and Event 201 from 2019 had the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other powerful globalist organizations saying that a plague is coming and that they would use that plague to lock down an in free society, bring in total surveillance and starve the third world to death while putting an authoritarian system in place.
[02:50:59.878 --> 02:51:17.311]  I began warning 12 weeks ago, desperately, that the Chi-Coms were hyping up COVID-19 to create hysteria here in the United States, and that blue states and blue cities would announce lockdowns to force Trump to follow suit, saying, if he doesn't, every death is his fault.
[02:51:18.172 --> 02:51:18.993]  And now that's happened.
[02:51:19.594 --> 02:51:21.136]  We're already in a depression.
[02:51:21.216 --> 02:51:22.537]  The numbers show a very deep one.
[02:51:23.078 --> 02:51:26.021]  And if it continues, the global supply chain will completely break.
[02:51:26.502 --> 02:51:30.386]  And the UN now admits that this year, in the months that are left,
[02:51:31.308 --> 02:51:37.195]  We're looking at 135 million people starving to death instead of the normal 10 million that is still unacceptable.
[02:51:37.575 --> 02:51:44.222]  Now most of those people are in the third world and it's very, very sad because when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[02:51:44.703 --> 02:51:49.468]  When the first world becomes a third world system, the fourth world is called death.
[02:51:49.809 --> 02:51:50.890]  It's called mass starvation.
[02:51:50.930 --> 02:51:52.191]  It's called societal
[02:51:53.692 --> 02:51:54.352]  Apocalypse!
[02:51:55.353 --> 02:52:04.916]  And now all over Latin America, all over Asia, all over areas of the Middle East and even Eastern Europe, people are beginning to starve to death.
[02:52:04.956 --> 02:52:16.821]  And even AP has come out talking about people in the United States that don't have money for food and how the food banks have run out and how they're unable to even take care of themselves.
[02:52:17.641 --> 02:52:21.082]  And now the food shortages have begun that, again, we predicted.
[02:52:21.242 --> 02:52:22.563]  I wouldn't go on air and tell you
[02:52:23.323 --> 02:52:26.307]  Twelve weeks ago, you better get your storable food right now.
[02:52:27.128 --> 02:52:31.194]  It's going to all sell out and the prices are going to go up if I didn't really believe that was going to happen.
[02:52:31.755 --> 02:52:36.661]  And yet again, I've been proven right because we know this is a premeditated plan by the globalists.
[02:52:36.681 --> 02:52:39.365]  They've written all these white papers, all these exercises.
[02:52:40.146 --> 02:52:47.709]  This is global corporate government engaging in economic warfare against free nations like Brazil, the United States, and the UK.
[02:52:48.289 --> 02:52:51.710]  And now the world's waking up to that fact, but is it too late?
[02:52:52.331 --> 02:52:55.032]  If I was you, I would get prepared right now.
[02:52:55.512 --> 02:52:57.793]  I would get high-quality, storable foods at m4wrestore.com.
[02:52:58.453 --> 02:53:00.273]  There's a lot of storable food ads out there running.
[02:53:00.774 --> 02:53:02.934]  Most of them have crap food or don't even have it in stock.
[02:53:03.255 --> 02:53:09.477]  They just take your money and then have their customer service person keep you on the line for months, hoping your food comes.
[02:53:10.643 --> 02:53:12.605]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to get your orders in now.
[02:53:12.705 --> 02:53:15.607]  We have the food, it's high quality, it's with the best company out there.
[02:53:15.627 --> 02:53:18.690]  They're packaging it, so there is a lag time before you get it.
[02:53:18.750 --> 02:53:22.654]  But everyone's been getting the food they ordered either a little bit early or right on time.
[02:53:23.054 --> 02:53:32.803]  And so, before the rest of the public figures this out, and we have to pause sales again of taking new orders like we did a month ago, you need to get your orders in now to ensure you get them.
[02:53:33.103 --> 02:53:35.185]  All the other products that are in FootwearStore.com are
[02:53:35.285 --> 02:53:36.005]  In our warehouse.
[02:53:36.045 --> 02:53:40.667]  So if you order on, say, a Monday, we normally ship it out by a Tuesday or a Wednesday.
[02:53:40.967 --> 02:53:41.968]  Very, very quick shipping.
[02:53:42.168 --> 02:53:46.990]  So also get your supplements, get your vitamins, get your minerals, get your t-shirts, get your books, get your films.
[02:53:47.430 --> 02:53:49.351]  Because this isn't just about feeding the body.
[02:53:49.391 --> 02:53:52.012]  It's about feeding the soul and waking others up.
[02:53:52.432 --> 02:53:54.373]  We have the new 5G Kill shirts.
[02:53:54.633 --> 02:53:56.694]  They're trying to ban exposing 5G on the internet.
[02:53:56.974 --> 02:54:02.117]  You can just wear the shirt and spread the word about the truth and exercise your free speech at the same time.
[02:54:02.137 --> 02:54:03.137]  So get your storable food.
[02:54:03.437 --> 02:54:12.112]  Get your vitamins, get your minerals, get your supplements, get your water filtration, your air filtration, get your new 5G Kills t-shirts and so much more at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:54:12.273 --> 02:54:15.619]  Whatever you do, get prepared and get ready now because this is serious.
[02:54:23.237 --> 02:54:34.501]  Folks, if you don't want to go through the rigmarole of trying to add it up and figure out everything you need, or you don't have the time, but you really want to supplement, but you just don't know or understand how to start, the 8-Pack Power Stack is the place to go.
[02:54:34.781 --> 02:54:36.682]  And, I mean, full transparency, folks, here's the deal.
[02:54:36.882 --> 02:54:39.283]  This 8-Pack Power Stack should be like a top seller.
[02:54:39.363 --> 02:54:45.826]  The amount of work and money that we put into the 8-Pack Power Stack is ridiculous because it was meant to compete.
[02:54:45.867 --> 02:54:49.088]  You know, we like to put out competitive products with the popular products.
[02:54:49.108 --> 02:54:55.272]  So you've seen, you know, the male Power Pack or all this other stuff, the Neutro Packs and all this stuff, and they're hundreds of dollars.
[02:54:55.372 --> 02:54:56.752]  And we were like, we'll compete with that.
[02:54:56.832 --> 02:55:02.535]  Well, folks, you know, you really have to market something like that and we're almost competing with ourselves because we have all these supplements.
[02:55:02.916 --> 02:55:07.018]  So we've now said, look, we're basically selling the 8-Pack Power Stack at cost.
[02:55:08.872 --> 02:55:11.434]  And this is the best deal you're gonna find on supplements.
[02:55:11.815 --> 02:55:12.215]  Point blank.
[02:55:12.435 --> 02:55:20.663]  So if you're thinking about starting a supplement routine, this is the cheapest way and the most effective way to get a full supplement routine into your daily routine.
[02:55:20.803 --> 02:55:22.084]  It's the 8-pack Power Stack.
[02:55:22.124 --> 02:55:23.085]  It's at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:55:23.125 --> 02:55:24.386]  I mean, folks, this is ridiculous.
[02:55:24.506 --> 02:55:32.674]  So we've just decided, like, okay, we can either really push this for how great it is, or we can just basically sell it at cost, get people healthy, and move some supplements.
[02:55:32.814 --> 02:55:34.135]  And that's what we've decided to do.
[02:55:34.295 --> 02:55:41.000]  So instead of just saying, OK, we're going to really promote 8-Pack Power Stack, we've just decided, let's just cut the price 75% right now.
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:41.721]  And you're good.
[02:55:41.841 --> 02:55:43.482]  And it's all sorted out for you.
[02:55:43.542 --> 02:55:46.624]  It's in conveniently little packages for the morning and for the night.
[02:55:46.704 --> 02:55:47.265]  It's 75% off.
[02:55:47.305 --> 02:55:52.809]  I mean, if you're really wanting to supplement, but you don't know where to begin or how to begin or you don't do the research, we've done it.
[02:55:52.869 --> 02:55:54.890]  We've put together the 8-Pack Power Stack, folks.
[02:55:54.990 --> 02:55:56.391]  It's out there for you 75% off.
[02:55:56.432 --> 02:55:59.614]  Point blank, best deal in supplementation right now, period.
[02:55:59.734 --> 02:55:59.974]  That's it.
[02:55:59.994 --> 02:56:01.335]  It's not going to get any better than that, folks.
[02:56:01.535 --> 02:56:03.096]  For the price, for the quality,
[02:56:03.957 --> 02:56:04.417]  It's a joke.
[02:56:04.557 --> 02:56:05.698]  It's not even close.
[02:56:05.758 --> 02:56:07.139]  There's nothing else that can compete.
[02:56:07.559 --> 02:56:11.161]  And so I've told you how we got to that point with it, but that's where we're at now.
[02:56:11.361 --> 02:56:13.262]  Take advantage at InfoWarsStore.com.
