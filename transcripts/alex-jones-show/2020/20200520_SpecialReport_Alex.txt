[00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.918]  There is a great lie that must be exposed if we have any chance of turning around this globalist post-human takeover.
[00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:21.270]  And it's that the collapse of the third world, the increased mass starvation, and the planetary depression was caused by COVID-19.
[00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.410]  No.
[00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:31.420]  The engineered hysteria surrounding COVID-19 is what has brought us to this point.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:51.524]  They always planned, if you study Event 201, Lockstep, and other globalist documents, to tell us that it would only be a few weeks that we'd be locked down, and then they would endlessly extend those out, sometimes relieving pressure, but always then tightening the noose down even stronger.
[00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:53.485]  And that's what they're telling us.
[00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.167]  Oh, you're going to have to have the vaccine.
[00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:58.889]  Oh, you're going to have to have a digital tattoo.
[00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.011]  That's a high tech implanted group of chips.
[00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:04.154]  Oh, you're going to have to have this immunity passport.
[00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:07.576]  We told everybody this four months ago because it was in the proposals.
[00:01:08.357 --> 00:01:22.941]  And then now they roll it out, the big tech companies, Google and Apple for quote, the first time, not really, but the first time publicly have coordinated to have the same app on their operating systems to track everywhere you go and what you do.
[00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:26.082]  It's the rollout of the surveillance grid.
[00:01:26.142 --> 00:01:30.643]  It's the rollout of the planetary social credit score and the worldwide digital currency.
[00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:32.204]  And all of this is admitted.
[00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:41.350]  Yesterday, we aired the Corbett Report's excellent Part 3 in the documentaries that they've been putting out about Bill Gates.
[00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.992]  Bill Gates and the Population Control Grid.
[00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:47.674]  And that's exactly what it is.
[00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:56.180]  In fact, that's what I call it in my film, Endgame, is a planetary control grid because they call it a control grid.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.103]  But what was powerful about the piece was
[00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:07.476]  We've just been showing everybody the news articles and the MIT documents and the printouts from the companies.
[00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:13.398]  From MIT, from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, from all these other different organizations.
[00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:21.602]  Corbett actually went and got the promotional videos from the companies themselves.
[00:02:22.884 --> 00:02:34.453]  With them saying, yes, Bill Gates came to us and he wanted a way for people to have a chip under their skin that wasn't as invasive or that would be harder to remove.
[00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.992]  And then again, it's a digital tattoo.
[00:02:38.732 --> 00:02:47.599]  Hundreds of little chips that they put onto your skin that are like little tiny glass needles carrying digital information.
[00:02:47.619 --> 00:03:02.950]  This is just so crazy that at every step of the way, it's been engineered, it's been planned, and literally thousands of governmental organizations and companies are on the payroll of Bill and Melinda Gates worldwide
[00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:13.933]  Unifying a planetary system through the medical system, which then will unify for your currency, which will then unify to track and trace you.
[00:03:13.953 --> 00:03:16.855]  And again, we've all pioneered exposing this plan.
[00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:23.300]  But what's incredible is, like the snap of the fingers, it's suddenly all here.
[00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:26.523]  And that's what the population has to understand.
[00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:44.513]  To make the train jump the tracks from a pro-human future, a renaissance future, that still had its dystopic problems but had a chance at real success for humanity, they have to have something massive like this with all the corporations, blue states, blue cities, and other authoritarian countries
[00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:54.601]  First, implementing things outside of the few pockets of quasi-free nations that are left, like the United States, Brazil, Switzerland, and a few others.
[00:03:55.222 --> 00:04:10.175]  But then, because they already have this global skin of big tech, and this global skin of big pharma, and the big military industrial complexes that all communicate and are corporately merging, it doesn't matter what the nation-state tries to do.
[00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:13.977]  Because it has now been made obsolete.
[00:04:14.577 --> 00:04:20.460]  And so Google and Apple and all of them together are hundreds of times more powerful now than the NSA.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.622]  And Google and Apple and Facebook and Twitter are revolving doors out of the government agencies into them.
[00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:36.926]  And so really we see this massive corporate takeover and people like Trump who still believes there should be presidents and still believes that the people should have some say.
[00:04:38.607 --> 00:04:51.678]  Unless they realize how they've already been made obsolete, we have no chance to ever come back to human power of the people against these globalists and overthrow the worldwide technocracy they've already set up.
[00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.820]  Because we're already in check.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.262]  We're about to be in checkmate.
[00:04:57.002 --> 00:05:02.507]  And again, it'd be one thing if these globalists just wanted to take over because they had more advanced ideas and were more organized.
[00:05:03.888 --> 00:05:12.715]  Their operating system is very, very cold-blooded, post-human exterminism, because they see that as the logical extension of human evolution.
[00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:15.697]  Well, shouldn't we just merge with machines and, quote, live forever?
[00:05:16.118 --> 00:05:18.880]  Because they see our biological form as imperfect and dying.
[00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:24.224]  Many of them don't believe in a spirit, or don't believe in energy.
[00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:26.578]  That is transcendent.
[00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.928]  And so they believe they are building the future and just brushing us aside in evolutionary decision.
[00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:56.968]  So I want to have a larger discussion about this and I want people to go look at Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Eric Schmidt and Bill and Melinda Gates and Hillary Clinton and Lord Rothschild and Madonna and just all of these globalist fat cats and their minions and ask,
[00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:07.127]  Do these people look in the eyes and the way they operate and just at a distance like they're really good people or powerful or that they actually are winners?
[00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:09.009]  They just reek.
[00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:10.743]  I think?
[00:06:29.178 --> 00:06:43.542]  And that's our greatest gift that any group trying in mass to take control of human destiny and trying to dumb people down so that they won't challenge the establishment in molding humanity into what they see as that destiny.
[00:06:44.382 --> 00:06:46.363]  And I don't want them to be my God.
[00:06:47.023 --> 00:06:49.684]  I don't want Bill Gates to be my doctor and my master.
[00:06:49.944 --> 00:06:56.486]  And I know from studying the globalists going back over 20 years that I've told you he is a key person in all of this who would emerge
[00:06:57.566 --> 00:06:59.668]  As the science officer, basically, of the Antichrist.
[00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:09.374]  And you notice it's happening exactly as I've told you, because I was only studying what they themselves were saying they were going to do.
[00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:11.375]  They're very public about it.
[00:07:11.956 --> 00:07:22.343]  I mean, Gates is up there on the Colbert Report, with Stephen Colbert, going, this is the final solution, is the vaccine, is the RNA, DNA vaccine.
[00:07:23.636 --> 00:07:25.976]  And Colbert's like, hey, whoa, don't use the final solution.
[00:07:26.316 --> 00:07:27.277]  And Gates starts laughing.
[00:07:27.317 --> 00:07:29.077]  Gates does all this on purpose.
[00:07:29.477 --> 00:07:31.497]  His wife wears an upside-down cross on purpose.
[00:07:32.057 --> 00:07:34.638]  All the bill numbers he sponsors are 6666 or 666.
[00:07:35.918 --> 00:07:37.258]  The patents are 666.
[00:07:37.918 --> 00:07:39.399]  This is a gang sign, people.
[00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.199]  He's rubbing it in your face.
[00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:46.900]  And so I'm begging listeners and viewers to understand that I know this is horrific.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.880]  I know this is frightening.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.461]  But knowing the truth and being prepared and saying no to it is the only way to stop it.
[00:07:53.703 --> 00:07:58.684]  And realizing that our governments have been bought off, overrun with these revolving door systems.
[00:07:58.724 --> 00:07:59.885]  This is a globalist plan.
[00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:07.527]  They fight with each other over who's gonna be in control of it, but they all are building the beast system because again, they know it's the way they're gonna be able to take over humanity.
[00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:13.889]  So if governments are in check, we take us out of check, and don't let them have checkmate,
[00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:16.812]  By individual word of mouth.
[00:08:16.872 --> 00:08:24.706]  Because even if they have the material control of us, if we mentally and spiritually transcend them, then, like a lock going into the
[00:08:25.703 --> 00:08:46.472]  Key going into the lock, it turns and we can open and take control of civilization and society very, very quickly by not supporting globalists, by not supporting big globalist corporations when we can, by supporting the little guys, by creating art, by creating literature, by creating music, by creating love, and by being good, decent people.
[00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:51.214]  We then will build our own truly sustainable economies.
[00:08:51.234 --> 00:08:54.635]  That's why they say they're building sustainability because everything they're doing is to kill sustainability.
[00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:56.022]  We're good to go.
[00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.631]  With their quote, smart dust.
[00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:18.474]  You know, when you see Johnny Depp's Transcendent, that is their propaganda.
[00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:31.664]  That's actually their plan over 20 years ago, is to put nanotech dust into the atmosphere itself, so the computers actually merge with our bodies, and so the silicon merges with the life forms here on Earth, so there's no escape.
[00:09:32.124 --> 00:09:34.286]  They don't just want to dominate us, they want to rape us.
[00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:35.266]  They want to merge with us.
[00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:40.808]  And that's why they're coming with the forced inoculations, which are not standard inoculations.
[00:09:40.928 --> 00:09:43.329]  Calling them vaccines is another big hoax.
[00:09:44.409 --> 00:09:46.869]  They are not vaccines, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:58.412]  They are systems that reprogram the inside of the cell and have the cells start creating new forms inside the body that basically represent the equivalent of
[00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:02.727]  Stem cells, as David Knight has been exposing on the broadcast today.
[00:10:02.747 --> 00:10:06.630]  So we're going to go back to Owen Schroer, back to David Knight laying all this out.
[00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.012]  Just please realize there is not more important information on the planet.
[00:10:10.313 --> 00:10:15.937]  We are censored and blocked and demonized and attacked because we have a chance to still turn this around and we have God on our side.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.961]  But we, the people, have to lead.
[00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:20.042]  We can't count on Trump.
[00:10:20.502 --> 00:10:21.843]  We can't count on Rand Paul.
[00:10:22.564 --> 00:10:23.424]  All of us together.
[00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:24.605]  I'm not saying Trump and Rand Paul are bad.
[00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:28.107]  I'm just saying all of us together have to just start making those decisions today.
[00:10:28.447 --> 00:10:30.389]  And the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:31.930]  Back to the live transmission.
[00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.471]  I salute and want to thank you all.
[00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:34.531]  And please spread the word now.
[00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:35.392]  This is critical information.
[00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:44.176]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[00:10:44.216 --> 00:10:50.018]  And I told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[00:10:50.098 --> 00:10:52.839]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[00:10:52.979 --> 00:11:00.281]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[00:11:00.341 --> 00:11:01.821]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.782]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[00:11:04.802 --> 00:11:06.703]  But with the election fraud and the
[00:11:06.863 --> 00:11:07.263]  I don't know.
[00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:33.837]  Dependent on them, they do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:37.709]  Get your storable food at MFORSTORE.COM right now while you still can.
