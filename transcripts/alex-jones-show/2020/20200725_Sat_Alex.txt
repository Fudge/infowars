[00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:03.364]  Warning.
[00:00:03.864 --> 00:00:04.344]  Warning.
[00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:05.245]  Warning.
[00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:08.006]  You are witnessing Blitzkrieg.
[00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:10.246]  AI takeover.
[00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:11.667]  Lightning war.
[00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:18.909]  The virus is the heavily scripted pretext to roll out the next quote advancement in civilization.
[00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.310]  The post-industrial, post-human world.
[00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.091]  You are in grave danger.
[00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:27.312]  You are being attacked.
[00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:29.554]  You are being targeted.
[00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:31.655]  The veil has been lifted.
[00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:36.497]  The New World Order is now coming for you and your family.
[00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:39.279]  You need to research State Department memorandum 200.
[00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:44.082]  You need to research the Club of Rome, limits to population and growth.
[00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:49.665]  You need to research Rockefeller Foundation plan, lockstep and others.
[00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:52.026]  This is an emergency warning.
[00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:57.310]  There is a robot AI takeover already prepared and already in full swing.
[00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.774]  This is 21st century warfare, but humanity can resist it.
[00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:02.635]  Emergency!
[00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:28.055]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:31.457]  Everywhere I go, I am mobbed by people.
[00:01:32.518 --> 00:01:36.001]  I was just in Florida for a week and dusted in the panhandle.
[00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:36.521]  Great people.
[00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:40.084]  And I went into the bayous to swim at springs.
[00:01:40.604 --> 00:01:46.148]  I went up and down the panhandle and black people, white people, Hispanic people, Asian people, Americans,
[00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:55.676]  came up to me, but not just Americans, folks from Brazil, and said, we love what you're doing, and we're awake, and we want to take action, and we hate the new world order.
[00:01:56.896 --> 00:02:02.998]  So that's some really positive, good news for everybody in this special Saturday emergency transmission we're doing.
[00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.399]  Because I'm not up here bragging, oh look, I'm so popular.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:16.383]  I'm saying my ideas and the basic ideas of freedom I promote are extremely popular with people all across the United States of race, color, and creed.
[00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.773]  The problem is, though, that most of them I've talked to, I'd say, have you spoken to others?
[00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:25.717]  Have you exposed that COVID-19 is an overblown hoax?
[00:02:26.257 --> 00:02:27.398]  Have you exposed the New World Order?
[00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:28.840]  And almost all of them said, well, no.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.201]  And I said, why?
[00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:32.063]  And they said, well, I don't want to bother people.
[00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:34.565]  You don't want to bother people.
[00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:42.672]  We're locked down across Europe, across the US, under a fraud that said 2.5 million Americans will be dead.
[00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:45.186]  And it's 20 plus times lower than that.
[00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:51.674]  And they counted people that died of gunshot wounds and motorcycle accidents and cancer.
[00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:52.934]  I think?
[00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:21.140]  Threw out the first pitch when he called for cancelling Major League Baseball this year.
[00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:29.087]  He threw out the first pitch a few days ago and was way off the mound, just like everything he's done was way off target.
[00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:31.670]  But it didn't matter, they still cheered him!
[00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.592]  You don't see Trump being invited out to throw the first pitch.
[00:03:34.893 --> 00:03:37.315]  You don't see Melania Trump on the cover of any magazines.
[00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:40.818]  You see Fauci on the cover of fashion magazines.
[00:03:41.977 --> 00:03:49.504]  Because he is a little, stunted, demonic dwarf that works for the globalists, shutting down our economy and destroying this nation.
[00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:53.508]  So, we can ask the question all day long, is Trump a good guy?
[00:03:53.528 --> 00:03:54.268]  Is Trump a bad guy?
[00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:55.570]  And this message is for Trump.
[00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:04.598]  But what we do know is, the NIH, the WHO, the shycoms, Hollywood, the Democrats, are openly rooting
[00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:12.336]  For the fall of this country and are openly enemies of our economy and of reality.
[00:04:12.536 --> 00:04:16.798]  And they have the nerve when they push all these lies and get caught in all this fraud.
[00:04:16.818 --> 00:04:23.121]  And the NIH says if one person has COVID, 15 people around them are counted as having it.
[00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:27.544]  And we put up with this fraud and these lies with 150,000 dead.
[00:04:27.564 --> 00:04:32.406]  Most of them died from something else instead of 2.5 million.
[00:04:32.686 --> 00:04:34.347]  And we put up with these criminals.
[00:04:35.768 --> 00:04:39.590]  And Fauci smirking up there at the baseball game, not wearing his mask.
[00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:48.773]  And once the cameras turn off, he pulls his mask off in Congress because it's all a show of submission to them and their fraud.
[00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:55.136]  And they're allied with the communist Chinese and the most powerful corporations on earth that think America's done.
[00:04:55.936 --> 00:04:58.477]  And they think Americans will bow to this garbage.
[00:04:58.657 --> 00:05:03.899]  So the big question is, is President Trump a friend or is President Trump a foe?
[00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:08.799]  Is President Trump fighting this or is President Trump going along with it?
[00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.644]  Well, on this emergency Saturday night transmission, we're going to lay it out right now!
[00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.632]  So is Trump good or is Trump bad?
[00:05:21.212 --> 00:05:24.356]  We'll get to that in a moment, but first, let's get to Fauci.
[00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:33.652]  And what he's really up to, because when President Trump tells Barstool Sports that if Fauci had his way, we'd be shut down for years, that's an understatement.
[00:05:34.192 --> 00:05:51.077]  Bill Gates, who controls Fauci and the Wuhan lab on record, has said that we'll never shake hands again and never stop wearing masks, and that all of this is a new normal, and we've got to have vaccines every month just to be able to live.
[00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:53.940]  Talk about a corporate takeover.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.202]  Here's Trump talking about Fauci's plans for the shutdown of the last years.
[00:05:58.742 --> 00:06:00.944]  So we got opening day today.
[00:06:01.664 --> 00:06:03.865]  So, uh, Fauci's throwing off the first pitch.
[00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:06.667]  You give him any tips you think he's gonna be able to... I mean, he seems like a little guy.
[00:06:06.687 --> 00:06:07.227]  I've never seen him.
[00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:08.388]  You expecting a good pitch here?
[00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:11.309]  Well, they say he was a good basketball player, and he is a very nice guy.
[00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.710]  How tall is he?
[00:06:12.811 --> 00:06:20.659]  Well, he's not tall, but he was a fast little guard, and they say he was a good basketball player, and he's actually a very nice guy.
[00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.060]  We don't always agree on everything.
[00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:26.345]  He likes to do things that I don't like to do, but ultimately I make the decision.
[00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:32.471]  But we make it all a group of people, and he's been here for like 45 years, for many, many years.
[00:06:33.454 --> 00:06:34.875]  And he's a nice man, actually.
[00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:36.775]  So I started doing... I'm a sports guy.
[00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:41.617]  Like, the company that bought us, Penn National, they're a gambling company, so sports gambling's a big part of what we do.
[00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:43.398]  I switched to the stock market, actually.
[00:06:43.758 --> 00:06:44.418]  Day trading.
[00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:50.261]  So Fauci's on my X list, because every time he talks and says the country should stay inside, my stocks tank.
[00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:51.781]  So I don't like that aspect of it.
[00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:55.163]  He'd like to see it closed up for a couple of years, but that's okay, because I'm president.
[00:06:55.183 --> 00:06:58.824]  So I say, well, I appreciate your opinion, now give me another opinion, somebody, please.
[00:06:59.044 --> 00:06:59.444]  Overruled.
[00:06:59.604 --> 00:07:00.345]  Yeah, you overruled.
[00:07:00.365 --> 00:07:01.005]  No, well, you have to.
[00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:03.830]  No, we're open and we're doing well.
[00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.330]  And I just had a press conference about opening the schools.
[00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.451]  You gotta open the schools.
[00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:10.511]  They have a stronger immune system even than you have or I have.
[00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:11.332]  Oh, that's not saying much to me.
[00:07:11.352 --> 00:07:11.752]  The kids?
[00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:12.952]  That's not saying much?
[00:07:12.992 --> 00:07:14.613]  No, I got that one.
[00:07:14.653 --> 00:07:15.313]  But they do.
[00:07:15.473 --> 00:07:16.073]  It's amazing.
[00:07:16.113 --> 00:07:17.173]  You look at the percentage.
[00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:18.554]  It's a tiny percentage of 1%.
[00:07:20.254 --> 00:07:23.635]  And in that one case, I mean, I looked at a couple of cases.
[00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:29.438]  If you have diabetes, if you have, you know, problems with something, but the kids are in great shape.
[00:07:29.478 --> 00:07:32.019]  So we want to open the schools and we're opening the country.
[00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:34.420]  And we had great numbers announced the other day.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.282]  And two weeks ago, we had the best, the best, the biggest number of jobs we've ever had.
[00:07:39.762 --> 00:07:41.523]  And the month before that, we had the same thing.
[00:07:41.883 --> 00:07:43.043]  A lot of good things are happening.
[00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:44.004]  And I think it looks like a V.
[00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:47.426]  We have a lot of people that would like to see their states close.
[00:07:47.486 --> 00:07:49.528]  I have a feeling on November 4th, they'll open them up.
[00:07:49.628 --> 00:07:51.429]  I think they want to do it for political reasons.
[00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.991]  But we're doing well.
[00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:54.852]  The polls are starting to really shape up.
[00:07:54.992 --> 00:07:56.273]  You know, Dave, we were doing great.
[00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:57.034]  We were sailing.
[00:07:57.814 --> 00:08:00.016]  George Washington would have had a hard time beating us.
[00:08:00.657 --> 00:08:05.601]  And then when the China virus came in, all of a sudden, you know, it's a dampener.
[00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:06.181]  It really is.
[00:08:06.241 --> 00:08:07.182]  It's a downer.
[00:08:07.582 --> 00:08:10.104]  Well, it's a downer, though, psychologically.
[00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:13.307]  And it went down, and now we're
[00:08:13.857 --> 00:08:15.337]  We're really starting to do well.
[00:08:15.357 --> 00:08:17.658]  We're looking really good in a lot of different places.
[00:08:17.818 --> 00:08:19.018]  So let's fact check this.
[00:08:19.638 --> 00:08:20.239]  Is it accurate?
[00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:21.879]  The answer is no.
[00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:25.500]  I'm going to show you the officials telling you it's wrong.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.900]  Trump is wrong in whitewashing this.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.681]  It's not going to last two years.
[00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:31.521]  It's far worse than that.
[00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:32.561]  Video.
[00:08:33.162 --> 00:08:34.102]  We'll show you the video in a moment.
[00:08:36.002 --> 00:08:42.784]  WHO, that's the UN, World Health Organization, says there will be no return to the old normal.
[00:08:43.598 --> 00:09:08.908]  COVID-19 will get worse, and worse, and worse, and will last years, after years, after years, because they told you 15 days to keep the hospitals empty, 15 days to flatten the curve, it was just an extended spring break, but as soon as you gave in, the UN and the globalists, once they get a woman kidnapped and handcuffed in the back of their van, once a woman's kidnapped and handcuffed in the back of a van with a ball gag, does she get out of it?
[00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:11.009]  Unless she fights and runs?
[00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:21.661]  Once you're in the back of the van tied up, you go to the shack, you go to the basement, and they drill your eyeballs out and rape you and tear your guts out and use you up.
[00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:29.147]  So, of course they say it's going to go on and on and on, because they're psychotic globalists.
[00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:35.389]  The UN runs extermination operations all over the world, in Burma, and in Central Africa, the Congo.
[00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:39.770]  I mean, the UN is even in the Washington Post, New York Times, they go, well, it's for the Earth.
[00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:46.392]  The tribes wouldn't leave their land that was being set aside as a UN carbon sink for offsetting mines.
[00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:48.733]  And so they had to be militarily dealt with.
[00:09:49.113 --> 00:09:51.515]  They just come with helicopters, mow everybody down.
[00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:53.317]  But you see it's the U.N.
[00:09:53.397 --> 00:09:53.857]  doing it.
[00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:57.280]  Just like Rwanda, so it's liberal.
[00:09:58.081 --> 00:09:58.822]  It's loving.
[00:09:59.883 --> 00:10:00.543]  So there you go.
[00:10:00.943 --> 00:10:02.145]  Trump is fact-checked.
[00:10:02.225 --> 00:10:02.825]  You're wrong.
[00:10:03.346 --> 00:10:04.326]  It never ends, Trump.
[00:10:04.587 --> 00:10:05.527]  Doesn't last two years.
[00:10:05.908 --> 00:10:07.289]  Stop covering up, Trump!
[00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:10.832]  You orange orangutan!
[00:10:11.553 --> 00:10:14.876]  Stop working for the New World Order, you white devil!
[00:10:16.513 --> 00:10:18.335]  Starting to think you are a white devil, actually.
[00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:23.600]  Working with the black devil, the head of the W.H.O., to carry this out.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.962]  But listen, getting serious here.
[00:10:26.403 --> 00:10:27.845]  Trump's pulled us out of the W.H.O.
[00:10:27.885 --> 00:10:28.886]  knowing they're running the scam.
[00:10:28.926 --> 00:10:30.207]  Trump stood up to Communist China.
[00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:32.312]  Trump has done pro-life marches.
[00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:34.053]  I don't know if a Republican ever did it at that level.
[00:10:34.514 --> 00:10:40.238]  Trump's the real deal, but when he was starting to get out of the UN, starting to expose the whole operation, that was great.
[00:10:40.298 --> 00:10:45.002]  Now he's suddenly talking about the vaccine being good, and he's suddenly talking about wearing masks.
[00:10:45.022 --> 00:10:47.624]  He's trying to have both sides for politics.
[00:10:49.045 --> 00:10:49.665]  Here's the problem.
[00:10:49.685 --> 00:10:52.087]  They're going to blame Trump regardless.
[00:10:52.107 --> 00:10:57.231]  They're already calling it Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi are already calling it the Trump virus.
[00:10:57.651 --> 00:10:59.933]  So by him now legitimizing the hoax,
[00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:05.710]  That's only legitimizing their attack, saying the virus is now the Trump virus.
[00:11:06.591 --> 00:11:10.194]  And so if Trump won't listen to people being nice to him, well, I'll be mean to him.
[00:11:11.675 --> 00:11:19.561]  Just like Tucker Carlson has said on record, and personally to me, Trump doesn't take people being nice to him, he takes people being very, very serious with him.
[00:11:20.102 --> 00:11:26.908]  Now, if somebody's a globalist and false, he won't listen to them attacking him, but if Trump thinks you're real, and you're actually bringing real beef to the table, he'll listen.
[00:11:27.188 --> 00:11:28.409]  So, Mr. President,
[00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:32.580]  Look, I know you're a good guy, but you're surrounded with 100 days out of the election.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.941]  We don't have time for games anymore.
[00:11:35.442 --> 00:11:36.142]  You have the U.N.
[00:11:36.202 --> 00:11:39.905]  saying the lockdown never ends, but China's already open for business.
[00:11:40.205 --> 00:11:44.889]  You got 150,000 dead, not 2.5 million, 20 plus times lower.
[00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.071]  Call the fraud out!
[00:11:47.451 --> 00:11:50.133]  Don't have half measures, God said in the Bible.
[00:11:52.155 --> 00:11:53.216]  You were neither hot nor cold.
[00:11:54.096 --> 00:11:54.937]  I spit you out of my mouth.
[00:11:56.238 --> 00:11:58.700]  We don't need lukewarm monkey vomit here.
[00:12:00.865 --> 00:12:02.166]  We need reality.
[00:12:03.466 --> 00:12:05.087]  Fauci goes or you go?
[00:12:06.487 --> 00:12:09.429]  The Rockefeller Combine run by Gates goes or you go?
[00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:11.649]  No more half measures with these people.
[00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:21.634]  Now continuing looking at all this data and all this news, we have to ask ourselves, is President Trump a good guy or a bad guy?
[00:12:21.754 --> 00:12:22.454]  He's a good guy.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:33.107]  But he's got a bunch of cowardly advisors around him telling him Americans are cowards and they want to wear a mask and they want to believe in COVID.
[00:12:33.347 --> 00:12:38.351]  So if you come out and say that every real death that happens, they will blame on you.
[00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:41.193]  But again, most of them are dying from cancer.
[00:12:41.413 --> 00:12:45.336]  They say a five-year-old boy died today, but they said he had an underlying condition.
[00:12:45.796 --> 00:12:46.537]  It's always the same.
[00:12:48.478 --> 00:12:49.219]  This is fear.
[00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:50.079]  This is terrorism.
[00:12:50.099 --> 00:12:53.002]  This is a typical lockdown of our culture and our society.
[00:12:53.601 --> 00:12:55.542]  Giving into it is not going to get us out of it.
[00:12:55.662 --> 00:13:04.587]  And it's all being done as the Democrats called for a year ago to shut down the economy, to remove you from office.
[00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:14.293]  And there's articles on Infowars.com where the Democrats are openly celebrating and the Communist Chinese are celebrating saying COVID-19 defeated populism.
[00:13:15.994 --> 00:13:17.935]  COVID-19 didn't defeat populism.
[00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:24.165]  Us being stampeded like lemmings off the edge of a cliff is what's defeating populism.
[00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:29.852]  Us buying in to the hysteria and the fetishizing of the mass is what's killing us!
[00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:37.821]  And there's no future if we don't wake up to the fraud and to the tyrants and to the intimidators and to the terrorists and say NO!
[00:13:38.602 --> 00:13:39.683]  I want to be straight with you.
[00:13:41.229 --> 00:13:45.953]  There will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.
[00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:52.319]  I repeat, there will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.840]  Let me be blunt.
[00:13:54.681 --> 00:13:57.664]  Too many countries are headed in the wrong direction.
[00:13:58.725 --> 00:14:01.247]  The virus remains public enemy number one.
[00:14:02.648 --> 00:14:06.512]  But the actions of many governments and people do not reflect of this.
[00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:11.945]  The only aim of the virus is to find people to infect.
[00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:20.133]  Mixed messages from leaders are undermining the most critical ingredient of any response.
[00:14:21.674 --> 00:14:22.035]  Trust.
[00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:31.464]  If governments do not clearly communicate with their citizens and roll out a comprehensive strategy focused on suppressing transmission,
[00:14:32.008 --> 00:14:34.870]  So the head of the World Health Organization tells you
[00:15:02.278 --> 00:15:03.919]  They'll be no return to normal.
[00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:05.519]  That's terrorism.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:18.224]  And they're telling you that your medical systems are under their control when everything they've told us about the death numbers, about the curve, about the hospitals, about the testing, all of it's been a lie.
[00:15:19.045 --> 00:15:21.186]  So why would we go along with this?
[00:15:21.206 --> 00:15:29.149]  Well, they're hoping through fear, and through learned helplessness, and through Stockholm Syndrome, you submit to this.
[00:15:30.589 --> 00:15:31.690]  But I want to shift gears now.
[00:15:33.004 --> 00:15:34.645]  And ask listeners a very, very serious question.
[00:15:37.146 --> 00:15:41.447]  We've had something called a social contract in this country and in the West for hundreds of years.
[00:15:42.027 --> 00:15:52.551]  And it's that we all believe in a better future for our children, that we're working together with the system to try to make it better, and trying to be good change agents in the system.
[00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:55.392]  But this new system tells you humans are bad.
[00:15:55.812 --> 00:15:56.633]  There's too many of us.
[00:15:57.648 --> 00:16:05.935]  From the beginning of that idea we're saying we're worthless and old people deserve to die, children deserve to die, unborn babies deserve to die.
[00:16:06.395 --> 00:16:07.196]  This is evil.
[00:16:08.297 --> 00:16:14.141]  So giving up on our social contract is not going to empower us, it's going to make us worthless.
[00:16:15.582 --> 00:16:18.525]  And the power structure is setting up a system where robots
[00:16:19.815 --> 00:16:20.875]  Replace humans.
[00:16:21.436 --> 00:16:31.580]  They're only using the third world now as robots to replace the first world because they don't want the third world to aspire to a first world system, a pro-human future.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.880]  I want to empower the first world.
[00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:36.421]  I want to empower the third world.
[00:16:37.942 --> 00:16:44.405]  And this entire globalist system that's been set up is about destroying those ladders up for the third world into the first world.
[00:16:45.645 --> 00:16:47.886]  Because if we really empower the third world,
[00:16:49.155 --> 00:16:51.837]  Well, the first world is going to go off-world.
[00:16:52.837 --> 00:16:55.218]  And that's really what the globalists don't want.
[00:16:55.299 --> 00:17:15.010]  They don't want big, huge, free countries, and amazing free corporations and ideas, and all sorts of independent film companies around the world putting out different cultural ideas, and humans setting up colonies, and some humans want to go off and fly ships into black holes, and other humans want to go off and go interdimensional, and other humans want to merge with machines, but it's all done according to free will.
[00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.871]  They don't want that free will.
[00:17:18.214 --> 00:17:24.358]  Above all, not the sex, not the gold, not the pedophilia and the psychic vampirism of the New World Order.
[00:17:24.798 --> 00:17:29.301]  What they really want is control over the destiny of humanity.
[00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:32.944]  Because we're master builders, man, the image of God, that's heavy when you know what it really means.
[00:17:33.764 --> 00:17:38.307]  To take control of us to build for them what they want.
[00:17:39.288 --> 00:17:43.611]  They want us to be their power slaves that serve this system.
[00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:48.907]  And as soon as they're done with us, they've already constructed it where we collapse and are destroyed forever.
[00:17:49.207 --> 00:17:54.649]  And the New World Order takes off with our stolen genetics, our stolen ideas, our destiny.
[00:17:55.429 --> 00:17:57.570]  That's something we cannot allow them to do.
[00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.671]  This is the theft of the future.
[00:17:59.951 --> 00:18:01.792]  Why do you think they want me off air?
[00:18:02.092 --> 00:18:03.553]  Why do you think they hate us so much?
[00:18:03.853 --> 00:18:05.353]  Why do you think they hate you so much?
[00:18:05.674 --> 00:18:07.294]  Why do you think they hate children so much?
[00:18:07.614 --> 00:18:11.016]  Because within babies is the seed, as Mahatma Gandhi said,
[00:18:11.676 --> 00:18:27.383]  of the universe and the potentiality of a free sentient being with consciousness to be able to literally envision a whole new world, a whole new universe, a whole new paradigm, a whole new multiverse.
[00:18:28.564 --> 00:18:34.987]  But for tyrants, they are threatened by that engine of creativity and that spark of God.
[00:18:35.707 --> 00:18:38.969]  We are not God, but we have been given Promethean fire.
[00:18:40.726 --> 00:18:45.027]  And now, as I started this transmission, I will repeat again.
[00:18:45.347 --> 00:18:47.508]  People come up here and they say, what is it like to be vindicated?
[00:18:47.868 --> 00:18:48.568]  What is it like?
[00:18:48.668 --> 00:18:52.109]  It's like everything you said they're saying on the news every day, but they're saying it's good.
[00:18:52.329 --> 00:18:53.209]  How did you know this?
[00:18:53.229 --> 00:18:55.570]  They're attacking families and saying humans are bad.
[00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.410]  They want to get rid of us and world government.
[00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.971]  We should all kill each other and kill ourselves.
[00:18:59.351 --> 00:19:00.411]  How did you know?
[00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:08.313]  I would love to tell you that I was a smart person, but I only got into history when I was a child and began to read what they were saying.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:08.960]  That's
[00:19:30.054 --> 00:19:38.716]  And creating the COVID lockdown, creating the race war, creating the crisis with China, with China starting because they're scared and they know they're losing control.
[00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:45.138]  You know, the new age folks call it indigo children or star seeds or all that.
[00:19:45.198 --> 00:19:49.779]  And that, that's just like psychology, uh, 200 years old, trying to put a name on it.
[00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:51.520]  All children are amazing.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.060]  All humans have an incredible destiny.
[00:19:53.407 --> 00:20:09.272]  But it is true that under times of great pressure and change that we're going to see a manifestation of the will of our ancestors and the universe and the space wind that's God's will manifesting in all of us in our DNA and in our children.
[00:20:09.973 --> 00:20:19.176]  So I'm not taking away from the magic that's happening in black children and white children and brown children and yellow children and red children who all have red blood.
[00:20:19.536 --> 00:20:20.496]  It's true and it's real.
[00:20:20.916 --> 00:20:23.097]  But it's all happening within us as well.
[00:20:23.482 --> 00:20:34.074]  And so the 5G suppression, the fluoride suppression, the GMO suppression is a bunch of desperate cowards trying to block what's about to happen with our species because they're so scared.
[00:20:34.274 --> 00:20:35.755]  And I will tell the enemy this!
[00:20:36.356 --> 00:20:40.460]  You may bring down some children and some people, and some will fall from your poison.
[00:20:41.021 --> 00:20:58.785]  But we will become immune to it, and out of this attack, out of the mud will come the lily and the nile, and out of this will become those that will understand the full scope of this evil, who are scarred by it, but transcend it, and become even more powerful, and you will be destroyed!
[00:20:58.945 --> 00:21:01.065]  I announce it now!
[00:21:01.205 --> 00:21:08.147]  You will be destroyed by the very children that you're trying to dumb down and poison, because the universe doesn't work that way.
[00:21:08.666 --> 00:21:10.108]  So you play your games, Bill Gates.
[00:21:10.388 --> 00:21:12.831]  You play your games, Rockefeller family, Rothschild family.
[00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:14.052]  You play your games.
[00:21:14.313 --> 00:21:22.722]  But I'm here to tell you one trillion percent you have failed from the foundations of the earth and you will be cut off from God, which is hell itself!
[00:21:33.055 --> 00:21:38.258]  This report is based on Amazing Polly's recent video, Is This Torture?
[00:21:39.098 --> 00:21:50.004]  In her video, Polly examines Amnesty International's 1973 report on torture and how it seems to reflect the current response to COVID-19.
[00:21:51.585 --> 00:22:07.458]  According to Amnesty International's report, torture is, "...the systematic and deliberate infliction of acute pain in any form by one person on another in order to accomplish the purpose of the former against the will of the latter."
[00:22:08.699 --> 00:22:13.702]  The report then uses Biedermann's chart of coercion to describe the technique.
[00:22:14.904 --> 00:22:21.327]  Psychologist Albert Biederman studied communist Chinese tactics known as DDD.
[00:22:21.967 --> 00:22:24.568]  Debility, Dependency, and Dread.
[00:22:25.528 --> 00:22:30.110]  The CIA has been trained to use Debility, Dependency, and Dread.
[00:22:30.691 --> 00:22:43.436]  And according to their 1983 Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual, many psychologists consider the threat of inducing debility to be more effective than debility itself.
[00:22:44.577 --> 00:22:54.361]  With DDD, the debilitated victim becomes dependent upon the torturer and develops a strong fear of anything vague or unknown.
[00:22:56.142 --> 00:23:00.944]  Biderman's chart of coercion lays out the design of DDD.
[00:23:02.224 --> 00:23:04.285]  Does any of this sound familiar?
[00:23:06.576 --> 00:23:07.176]  Number 1.
[00:23:07.676 --> 00:23:08.337]  Isolation.
[00:23:09.037 --> 00:23:15.319]  We see this with quarantines and social distancing and the prohibition of crowds and large gatherings.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.640]  Number 2.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.961]  Monopolization of perception.
[00:23:19.621 --> 00:23:27.944]  Corporate mainstream media has monopolized all of pop culture and those on social media who challenge the mainstream narrative are censored.
[00:23:28.544 --> 00:23:32.506]  Also listed is restricted movement and monotonous food.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.380]  Number three.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.501]  Induced debilitation and exhaustion.
[00:23:38.622 --> 00:23:50.065]  Gym closures, church closures, losing your job, school closings, and wearing masks all day long increase stress and provokes exhaustion and debilitation.
[00:23:51.486 --> 00:23:52.106]  Number four.
[00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:53.026]  Threats.
[00:23:54.046 --> 00:24:01.609]  We are threatened that our own children may be taken away from our homes and that experimental forced vaccines are coming.
[00:24:02.543 --> 00:24:06.285]  We are told that more will die if we restart America.
[00:24:06.825 --> 00:24:14.629]  And we are threatened with tracking chips, contact tracing, and a new normal.
[00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.031]  Here we find fluctuations of interrogators' attitudes.
[00:24:21.652 --> 00:24:26.354]  Such as, BLM protests are good, Trump rallies are bad.
[00:24:26.994 --> 00:24:30.216]  Walmart is okay, but small businesses are not.
[00:24:31.115 --> 00:24:37.640]  The torturer will provide occasional indulgences such as rewards for partial compliance.
[00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:42.524]  If you just wear a mask, someday we can return to normal.
[00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:44.445]  Number six.
[00:24:45.026 --> 00:24:47.687]  Demonstrating omnipotence and omniscience.
[00:24:48.508 --> 00:24:54.132]  Shutting down the entire global economy was a pretty good demonstration of omnipotence.
[00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:58.355]  Huge fines and jail for people not wearing a mask.
[00:24:59.557 --> 00:25:05.441]  We see the omniscience with Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates and other official experts.
[00:25:06.382 --> 00:25:08.363]  Number seven is degradation.
[00:25:08.963 --> 00:25:12.326]  Being called non-essential or a science denier.
[00:25:13.106 --> 00:25:19.250]  Being treated as ignorant fools and called names by celebrities for not complying.
[00:25:20.362 --> 00:25:27.069]  Number 8 Enforcing Trivial Demands This final step develops habits of compliance.
[00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:38.281]  Enforcement of minute rules such as standing 6 feet apart, following arrows, and showing support for violent BLM protests.
[00:25:40.484 --> 00:25:56.393]  Also, according to the report on torture, many victims become ill as a result of coercion, and more than half the illnesses listed in the report can be easily diagnosed as COVID-19 according to CDC guidelines.
[00:25:57.454 --> 00:26:00.075]  Do you really think that this is all a coincidence?
[00:26:01.396 --> 00:26:08.280]  Or are the people of the world being subjected to an advanced form of torture, coercion, and mind control?
[00:26:09.741 --> 00:26:12.142]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:26:17.225 --> 00:26:24.570]  First, we were told that wearing masks would do more harm than good, which is what the science still supports.
[00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:34.395]  But now, even as the COVID-19 pandemic is turning out to be less harmful than the seasonal flu, we are being told to wear the mask.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.326]  Boston, Texas has threatened a $2,000 fine for those not wearing the mask.
[00:26:43.163 --> 00:26:47.045]  And have even suggested that we wear the mask while at home.
[00:26:47.525 --> 00:26:49.506]  We still need people to wear the mask in public.
[00:26:49.527 --> 00:26:52.148]  We still need people to keep social distance and isolation.
[00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:57.631]  Ryan, the one thing I want to try to get across today is we need to do that when we're in our homes also.
[00:26:57.971 --> 00:27:03.374]  Science tells us that these masks are doing nothing but hurting our natural immune system.
[00:27:03.794 --> 00:27:06.716]  So why is it so important that we wear the mask?
[00:27:08.123 --> 00:27:15.948]  If one were to look at what is happening as if it were a massive initiation ritual, then things may begin to make more sense.
[00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:21.232]  The initiation ritual can be found throughout all of human history.
[00:27:22.172 --> 00:27:30.658]  We find it in ancient tribes and religions, all the way up to modern gangs, fraternities, and in the military.
[00:27:31.795 --> 00:27:35.476]  Psychological studies have taught us how initiation rituals work.
[00:27:36.276 --> 00:27:42.718]  Primarily, how they increase a person's desire to conform to the group they are being initiated into.
[00:27:43.859 --> 00:27:46.220]  The ritual is almost always the same.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.541]  First, the initiate is isolated.
[00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:56.763]  Their familiar everyday routines are disrupted, and their normal rules of living are altered.
[00:27:57.918 --> 00:28:00.140]  The initiates are made to look the same.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:07.525]  Their heads may be shaved, they may be given matching outfits, or they may be instructed to wear a mask.
[00:28:08.585 --> 00:28:20.113]  These techniques symbolically strip the initiate of their unique identity, so they can cease seeing themselves as an individual and begin seeing themselves as part of the group.
[00:28:21.794 --> 00:28:27.098]  The wearer of the mask loses his previous identity and assumes a new one.
[00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:34.987]  The initiate is then subjected to just enough trauma to put them in a mild state of cognitive dissonance.
[00:28:36.155 --> 00:28:41.139]  This dissonance puts the initiate into a state of confusion and anxiety.
[00:28:41.939 --> 00:28:46.643]  They are now ready to be transformed into a member of the initiating group.
[00:28:47.683 --> 00:28:53.848]  In their isolation, thoughts they have ignored or buried for years suddenly become unavoidable.
[00:28:54.628 --> 00:29:00.813]  Emotions are triggered, and a new window of thought is opened within the initiate's mind.
[00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:05.880]  And in this state, the new normal is introduced.
[00:29:07.201 --> 00:29:13.343]  This worldwide initiation ritual is creating a massive separation in humanity.
[00:29:14.464 --> 00:29:20.786]  The obedient and the defiant are being drawn apart like a chemistry purification experiment.
[00:29:21.747 --> 00:29:26.268]  And it would seem that the obedient ones are being initiated into something.
[00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:28.089]  The new normal.
[00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.690]  The new age.
[00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:32.379]  The new world order.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.621]  A world where science no longer matters.
[00:29:37.961 --> 00:29:42.122]  A world where blind obedience is all that is respected.
[00:29:42.142 --> 00:29:53.806]  And if this is a worldwide initiation ritual, then we can certainly expect the obedient initiated to be turned against the rest of us.
[00:29:55.546 --> 00:29:57.987]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:30:17.285 --> 00:30:21.452]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30:21.952 --> 00:30:32.608]  There have been memes all over the internet saying Jones was the one that warned us about black vans pulling up and jerking us into them and now he's suddenly for the feds doing that against peaceful protesters.
[00:30:33.672 --> 00:30:41.156]  I was against the Feds attacking Waco to start a war with Christians in America, even though Koresh was a cult leader and was in the wrong.
[00:30:41.576 --> 00:30:43.857]  He could have been arrested in town any day he worked in town.
[00:30:44.477 --> 00:30:45.238]  I knew the Davidians.
[00:30:45.278 --> 00:30:46.398]  They were good people overall.
[00:30:47.058 --> 00:30:55.082]  They went through hell and I was against the Feds going out and shooting up that place and then having a 50 plus day siege and then burning those children alive.
[00:30:56.123 --> 00:31:00.745]  But it's now Antifa and Soros funded globalists trying to overthrow the local police
[00:31:01.141 --> 00:31:02.802]  You know the old expression about snitches?
[00:31:02.862 --> 00:31:04.623]  Well in this case, snitches get rewards.
[00:31:22.059 --> 00:31:30.986]  He's now come out and said that the Portland rioters that have been attacking the federal courthouse for three weeks, that they're peaceful and they're good.
[00:31:31.006 --> 00:31:33.848]  And this is the greatest example of democracy.
[00:31:34.048 --> 00:31:34.448]  Here he is.
[00:31:35.249 --> 00:31:35.929]  Good evening, Mayor.
[00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:40.293]  I have a question about a tweet you sent yesterday about Portland.
[00:31:40.373 --> 00:31:47.738]  You expressed solidarity with the demonstrators there and said that they represent the best of our democratic ideals.
[00:31:49.810 --> 00:32:10.456]  The violence there has been hard to ignore, and Portland police have talked about setting fires at the courthouse, people firing projectiles, throwing bricks at local law enforcement, and now the clashes with federal law enforcement, and the White House showed a video montage of all the violence that's accompanied the protests there, and it's not even clear what they're really protesting.
[00:32:11.156 --> 00:32:15.497]  So, how does that represent the best of our democratic ideals?
[00:32:16.829 --> 00:32:28.742]  I know that with protesters, and oftentimes this happens the opposite way with police officers, individual moments people want to paint as the brush of the collective behavior.
[00:32:29.623 --> 00:32:37.411]  Certainly the actions that we saw in Minneapolis of four officers don't reflect the actions of every police officer in America.
[00:32:38.032 --> 00:33:00.542]  Nor do actions of protesters or in some cases people who aren't even protesters who would take advantage of protests either to loot or to cause violence represent what Americans are doing across America, which is peacefully protesting and making sure that they exercise not only their right but their responsibility to speak out against systemic racism, to cry out when there is unnecessary death of Americans like George Floyd,
[00:33:01.022 --> 00:33:06.686]  And to call for a reimagining of what we can do to co-create an even safer America for everybody.
[00:33:07.086 --> 00:33:08.827]  To me, that is the best of America.
[00:33:09.328 --> 00:33:18.854]  Even when there's people who I disagree with, even when people say things in a way that I wouldn't, I do think that it is a good day in a democracy when people are exercising their democratic rights.
[00:33:19.294 --> 00:33:20.495]  And that's what I was talking about.
[00:33:21.455 --> 00:33:26.879]  If people want to pick out people who are violating the law, that is not what I'm talking about.
[00:33:27.219 --> 00:33:41.830]  But people who are out there standing up to claim this democracy and to stand against the hateful values that we have seen come out of both incidents like what we saw in Minneapolis and sometimes coming out of the highest levels of the leaders in this land.
[00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.852]  I think it's not only again the right, but their responsibility.
[00:33:45.652 --> 00:33:45.933]  Thank you.
[00:33:49.055 --> 00:33:50.376]  You mentioned John Lewis.
[00:33:51.156 --> 00:33:56.000]  He was a nonviolent protester and an organizer, and there's nothing
[00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.311]  Nonviolent about these protests.
[00:33:58.331 --> 00:33:59.272]  They're not organized.
[00:33:59.872 --> 00:34:05.656]  There's no sense of the history of nonviolent protest in this country.
[00:34:05.957 --> 00:34:13.602]  It's just not clear that there's any sort of attempt even to march in a way that would appeal to Americans in general.
[00:34:13.662 --> 00:34:17.605]  This is just a confrontation with authority that's turned very violent.
[00:34:18.821 --> 00:34:20.262]  That's your summary of it.
[00:34:20.402 --> 00:34:21.623]  I would respectfully disagree.
[00:34:21.663 --> 00:34:25.405]  I've seen people marching very peacefully in Portland.
[00:34:25.425 --> 00:34:27.246]  I've seen mothers joining arms.
[00:34:27.306 --> 00:34:30.708]  I've seen children out there making art.
[00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:41.095]  I've seen many people doing that, just as if we cut to our high school classes and watch the images of the civil rights struggle, you will see clashes that happened.
[00:34:42.115 --> 00:34:44.136]  That did not represent who we are.
[00:34:44.317 --> 00:34:48.019]  Again, I'm not speaking about people who break the law, but to say that
[00:34:48.539 --> 00:34:52.261]  All protesters in Portland or here are people who are breaking the law.
[00:34:52.641 --> 00:34:54.362]  I just think it's statistically not true.
[00:34:54.742 --> 00:35:02.286]  There are hours and hours of video of people trying to break in with hammers, people attacking, throwing fireworks, trying to burn the place down.
[00:35:02.887 --> 00:35:04.568]  And again, I don't lionize the feds.
[00:35:05.208 --> 00:35:06.589]  Any big power structure is out of control.
[00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:09.010]  But this isn't a group of leftists trying to
[00:35:09.412 --> 00:35:14.775]  And the good news is, Charlemagne Tha God, one of the biggest radio hosts in the United States,
[00:35:33.117 --> 00:35:35.318]  Has come out and attacked Joe Biden.
[00:35:35.878 --> 00:35:48.222]  I've been waiting for years for people of any color, I don't care if you're black or white, to wake up the Democrats who were the KKK, the Democrats that supported Hitler, the Democrats that set up Planned Parenthood whose main mission was to abort black people.
[00:35:48.763 --> 00:35:57.746]  I've been waiting for black folks to finally wake up to how crazy it is to point at the party of Lincoln, who's not perfect by the way, and say they're the KKK.
[00:35:58.382 --> 00:36:00.603]  And Trump's the KKK, but ignore all this.
[00:36:01.043 --> 00:36:05.306]  But now, Joe Biden has come out and said, if you don't vote for me, you're not black.
[00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:08.627]  Charlamagne, big talk show host, Charlamagne that God said, that's BS.
[00:36:09.207 --> 00:36:17.852]  Well, now he's come out and said that God tells Joe Biden to shut the F up over first racist president remark.
[00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:24.215]  So Charlamagne that God tells Joe Biden to shut the F up over first racist president remark.
[00:36:24.614 --> 00:36:27.955]  Saying that President Trump is the first racist president in U.S.
[00:36:27.995 --> 00:36:28.315]  history.
[00:36:28.556 --> 00:36:29.916]  That's obviously an insult.
[00:36:30.216 --> 00:36:31.417]  It's obviously not true.
[00:36:31.717 --> 00:36:32.757]  It's obviously a fraud.
[00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:35.318]  And anyone who buys it is in a cult.
[00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:37.299]  And this is what Joe Biden's doing.
[00:36:37.559 --> 00:36:45.602]  Joe Biden sold out to the shycoms, who are the most racist people on earth, who have 3 million Muslims in death camps, a million Christians, and a million Buddhists in death camps.
[00:36:47.858 --> 00:36:54.423]  We keep waiting for LeBron James, who loves the NBA and won't criticize Communist China, but tells us America sucks all day.
[00:36:54.663 --> 00:36:58.126]  We keep waiting for him to say something about the death camps in China.
[00:36:58.486 --> 00:37:02.609]  But at least Charlemagne, the God, is going in that direction.
[00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:08.534]  I'm going to close out this live transmission until I come back this Sunday, 4-6pm.
[00:37:08.574 --> 00:37:10.375]  I'll be live tomorrow as well.
[00:37:10.755 --> 00:37:16.079]  Once this has aired, it's going to loop on the InfoWars streams until we are back.
[00:37:17.202 --> 00:37:19.724]  Tomorrow night, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:37:19.744 --> 00:37:20.804]  with a Sunday transmission.
[00:37:21.285 --> 00:37:23.466]  But seriously, folks, there's so much censorship.
[00:37:24.047 --> 00:37:29.170]  And the fact that Infowars is still on air is so maverick, is so important, is so incredible.
[00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.471]  And the fact that you're promoting it is so amazing.
[00:37:31.992 --> 00:37:33.993]  We're having huge results thanks to you together.
[00:37:34.353 --> 00:37:34.874]  Keep it up.
[00:37:35.394 --> 00:37:40.737]  Send out this live feed on your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube, your personal messengers, your
[00:37:41.929 --> 00:37:46.895]  Text messages, your email, your word of mouth because that's how we override the AI.
[00:37:47.296 --> 00:37:55.726]  America and the world is in such a war against these big global corporations allied with the communist Chinese and Hollywood and others that are so incredibly evil.
[00:37:56.087 --> 00:37:57.088]  America's not perfect.
[00:37:57.281 --> 00:38:00.902]  But it does, at its base, believe in empowering humanity and personal freedom.
[00:38:01.142 --> 00:38:05.483]  And that's not compatible with the globalists and their paradigm and their system.
[00:38:05.503 --> 00:38:06.443]  So they want to shut it down.
[00:38:07.223 --> 00:38:12.284]  So none of the people out there serving this system, I'm talking 99% of them, are even getting power from it.
[00:38:12.724 --> 00:38:13.464]  That's what's crazy.
[00:38:13.684 --> 00:38:15.945]  You're not empowering yourself burning down America.
[00:38:16.245 --> 00:38:21.826]  You're ending your attempt to be able to even broker a better deal for yourself and your family.
[00:38:22.642 --> 00:38:24.883]  That's why tyrants everywhere want to shut America down.
[00:38:25.183 --> 00:38:30.145]  And that's why only you and your action, speaking out and spreading the word, stands in their way.
[00:38:30.885 --> 00:38:31.645]  I've done my job.
[00:38:31.905 --> 00:38:33.045]  I know you've tried to do yours.
[00:38:33.086 --> 00:38:34.586]  Many of you have done a better job than I have.
[00:38:34.786 --> 00:38:38.067]  But I'm asking you now to realize how important you are and to take action.
[00:38:38.287 --> 00:38:45.550]  Because if there was ever a Paul Revere in this world back in 1776, it's you today in late July 2020.
[00:38:53.157 --> 00:38:59.421]  We know that the prescribed PCR tests are not detecting the COVID-19 genome.
[00:39:00.121 --> 00:39:07.786]  According to the CDC's own literature, the tests do not rule out bacterial infection or other viruses.
[00:39:08.687 --> 00:39:15.931]  They are detecting all varieties of coronavirus, including the common cold, and counting it as COVID-19.
[00:39:17.492 --> 00:39:27.996]  And it has been pointed out for months that the geographical locations experiencing the most cases of COVID also seem to have active 5G technology.
[00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:41.841]  After a video went viral in which David Icke suggested that 5G is somehow responsible for positive cases of COVID-19, YouTube deleted it and began deleting all videos on the subject.
[00:39:42.421 --> 00:39:53.452]  Including a video we made that pointed out how on October 31st of 2019, Wuhan, China became the first major testbed of 5G technology.
[00:39:56.058 --> 00:40:05.584]  In late June, a new scientific research paper entitled, 5G Technology and Induction of Coronavirus in Skin Cells was published.
[00:40:06.425 --> 00:40:13.710]  This paper gives a scientific explanation of the relationship between 5G technology and the coronavirus.
[00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:22.636]  Unlike 4G or other radio waves, the 5G millimeter waves can penetrate the nucleus of a cell.
[00:40:23.652 --> 00:40:26.294]  The DNA then acts as an inductor.
[00:40:27.135 --> 00:40:31.639]  It reacts to the 5G waves by producing an electromagnetic field.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:40.387]  Like a shadow, the shape of the electromagnetic field reflects the hexagonal and pentagonal shapes of the DNA base pairs.
[00:40:41.528 --> 00:40:45.890]  This electromagnetic field produces holes in the cellular liquid.
[00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:50.692]  Hexagonal, pentagonal voids are created in the nucleoplasm.
[00:40:51.152 --> 00:40:56.094]  And to remedy this disturbance, extra bases are created to fill the voids.
[00:40:56.794 --> 00:41:07.519]  These bases then join together to produce coronavirus-like structures within the cell, which the PCR test will read as a positive case of COVID-19.
[00:41:10.984 --> 00:41:11.745]  The exosome.
[00:41:12.326 --> 00:41:14.608]  The exosome was discovered in 1983.
[00:41:15.189 --> 00:41:21.476]  Exosomes are created naturally within the cell to clean and repair cellular damage.
[00:41:22.817 --> 00:41:27.242]  Both exosomes and COVID-19 are the same size and shape.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:33.304]  They both have the same ACE2 receptor, and they both contain RNA.
[00:41:34.465 --> 00:41:37.588]  Exosomes behave and appear the same as a virus.
[00:41:38.328 --> 00:41:43.773]  Some scientists even claim that the so-called virus is in fact the exosome.
[00:41:45.194 --> 00:41:54.962]  Since the discovery of the exosome, over 200 microbiologists have been murdered, committed suicide, or died in a suspicious manner.
[00:41:56.792 --> 00:42:01.614]  If you question this mystery, you are undoubtedly labeled a conspiracy theorist.
[00:42:02.995 --> 00:42:08.757]  And if you question the current unproven virus theory, you are labeled a science denier.
[00:42:09.737 --> 00:42:18.141]  The only socially acceptable solution that you are allowed to accept is an experimental vaccine that will alter your DNA.
[00:42:19.381 --> 00:42:23.503]  Which ultimately raises the question, who owns your body?
[00:42:25.595 --> 00:42:27.917]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:43.687]  InfoWars.
[00:42:44.027 --> 00:42:45.648]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:42:45.668 --> 00:42:52.133]  I was talking to my patron supplier, Great Suppliers, and I was talking to them last week.
[00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:55.195]  They said, well, we're really down to two weeks on most deliveries now.
[00:42:56.288 --> 00:42:57.269]  And I said, I'm going to tell people that.
[00:42:57.289 --> 00:43:00.070]  They said, well, some specialty foods and things, it's still six weeks.
[00:43:01.971 --> 00:43:06.554]  And so I talked to the owner, I talked to the CEO yesterday, today, my crew did.
[00:43:07.054 --> 00:43:07.654]  They said, fine.
[00:43:09.275 --> 00:43:12.097]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[00:43:12.197 --> 00:43:13.197]  It's the highest quality.
[00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:13.818]  They've got it.
[00:43:13.838 --> 00:43:15.919]  They've got four plants in the U.S.
[00:43:15.939 --> 00:43:18.120]  depending on what you order, depending on how fast you get it.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.481]  But really, the average is like three weeks.
[00:43:20.501 --> 00:43:23.423]  They just said, say four under promise, over deliver.
[00:43:24.932 --> 00:43:27.534]  The rave reviews, five-star reviews at InFullMoreStore.com.
[00:43:27.554 --> 00:43:28.615]  We have their whole catalog.
[00:43:28.655 --> 00:43:29.475]  They're in our back end.
[00:43:29.495 --> 00:43:30.256]  They take the orders.
[00:43:30.276 --> 00:43:40.242]  It goes right to, you know, in the queue where your order comes in and use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the service, get some air before you get sucked back down.
[00:43:40.543 --> 00:43:42.484]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[00:43:42.664 --> 00:43:46.347]  I personally have gotten a place out in the country, which I never did.
[00:43:46.367 --> 00:43:52.851]  We have family land in East Texas, but I never actually moved out and got a place in the middle of the countryside.
[00:43:52.891 --> 00:43:53.572]  I've done that now.
[00:43:54.292 --> 00:44:00.896]  I'm putting a trailer on it, you know, and a water well, and some solar panels because it's bad, folks.
[00:44:01.436 --> 00:44:04.558]  And I have to now start going into defense posture.
[00:44:04.578 --> 00:44:09.820]  80% is offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globalists.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:16.184]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but we're gonna still go down the hard road now.
[00:44:17.179 --> 00:44:22.682]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still gonna be bad in my view.
[00:44:23.062 --> 00:44:24.543]  You need to get high-quality, storable food.
[00:44:24.583 --> 00:44:25.364]  It's something you need.
[00:44:25.764 --> 00:44:36.810]  We have high-quality, ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast of 360Win, so please take care of your storable foods needs at InfoWareStore.com to get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.412]  It's in great containers, high-quality, lasts 25 years.
[00:44:39.592 --> 00:44:43.594]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:44:48.655 --> 00:44:56.098]  Many people find it hard to accept a few people could orchestrate a whole global pandemic hoax.
[00:44:56.958 --> 00:45:04.381]  But in fact, when we understand the structure of how the world's controlled, it becomes relatively straightforward.
[00:45:05.962 --> 00:45:11.304]  I've talked for decades about a global cult, what some call the 1%.
[00:45:13.357 --> 00:45:23.031]  A global web of interconnected strands of secret societies, semi-secret groups, and then in the public arena, government agencies.
[00:45:23.331 --> 00:45:27.517]  And all of these groups appear on the surface to be unconnected.
[00:45:28.198 --> 00:45:28.659]  They aren't.
[00:45:31.687 --> 00:45:38.329]  You can symbolize the way this global web works as the structure of a global corporation.
[00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:53.215]  Say, McDonald's with a headquarters at a point in the world, and in every other country, you have the subsidiaries that operate according to the centrally dictated headquarters.
[00:45:53.655 --> 00:45:59.217]  And so, you go into a McDonald's in Russia, South Africa, Australia, America, Britain,
[00:45:59.557 --> 00:46:02.980]  And you're basically going into the same McDonald's operating in the same way.
[00:46:03.881 --> 00:46:08.044]  And this global cult structures itself in very similar lines.
[00:46:11.907 --> 00:46:17.031]  At the center of the web, and this is in the shadows, you have what I call the spider.
[00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:22.255]  This is the inner core of the cult that is driving the direction of the world.
[00:46:23.689 --> 00:46:30.994]  And then in each country they have a subsidiary network, certain families and secret societies.
[00:46:31.694 --> 00:46:41.501]  Their job is to impose the will of the center, the spider, dictating policy in virtually every country.
[00:46:45.993 --> 00:47:03.260]  And in each of these subsidiary networks, on a national level, you have the pyramids of government and politics, banking and finance, pyramids of media ownership, and the pyramids of the medical system.
[00:47:04.375 --> 00:47:16.504]  So if you take health policy, the few at the top in each country are dictating how doctors and the rest of the medical profession have to act, what they have to do.
[00:47:17.465 --> 00:47:22.129]  The medical profession then follow overwhelmingly unquestioningly.
[00:47:23.052 --> 00:47:28.636]  And those who do question and resist find themselves and their careers in often serious trouble.
[00:47:29.536 --> 00:47:35.780]  And the top of these pyramids in each country answer to the same master globally.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:36.941]  The spider.
[00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:45.386]  And therefore the will of the spider is dictating what the policy will be right across the world.
[00:47:46.067 --> 00:47:51.410]  Just the people at the top impose it upon the pyramid structure in its entirety.
[00:47:53.502 --> 00:48:00.470]  So if we look globally at this pandemic, first of all, so important, forget borders.
[00:48:00.951 --> 00:48:03.574]  This cult does not have borders.
[00:48:03.954 --> 00:48:05.716]  They are for the public.
[00:48:06.397 --> 00:48:11.063]  This cult is global and operates globally.
[00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:16.812]  And one of its biggest centers is China.
[00:48:17.413 --> 00:48:30.098]  The cult was behind the Chairman Mao revolution that turned China into this fascistic, communistic, they're the same thing really, tyranny.
[00:48:30.858 --> 00:48:38.782]  And what they've done behind the walls of that tyranny is incubate a system that they want to play out globally.
[00:48:39.628 --> 00:48:57.664]  China has become a fiercely controlled country, not least controlled via technology, with millions and millions of face recognition cameras, which allow the Chinese authorities to find anyone, often literally in minutes, in real time.
[00:48:59.545 --> 00:49:06.790]  In the West, until now, they've had to pay some lip service to freedom and democracy.
[00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:12.553]  Only in theory, but they have to, or have up to this point, have to hide behind that propaganda.
[00:49:13.134 --> 00:49:26.282]  So the West has been able to move, until now, slower than China in terms of rolling out this fierce, draconian, Orwellian, fascistic control system.
[00:49:27.383 --> 00:49:31.844]  But in China, the authorities decide what's going to happen, and it just happens.
[00:49:31.864 --> 00:49:36.825]  There's no democracy or lip service to freedom to have to deal with.
[00:49:37.365 --> 00:49:41.146]  And so in China, it's moved very, very much faster.
[00:49:41.626 --> 00:49:49.788]  And the time has come where the cult wants to play out the Chinese model of control right across the world.
[00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:57.822]  Ask yourself, what has the West become far more like since this pandemic hoax?
[00:49:58.623 --> 00:49:59.023]  China!
[00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:00.904]  And becoming more so all the time.
[00:50:01.785 --> 00:50:07.848]  So this is how the pandemic, or what has become known as the plandemic, was played out.
[00:50:10.643 --> 00:50:15.205]  First of all, you have people taken ill in Wuhan, China.
[00:50:15.565 --> 00:50:28.690]  And people ill in Wuhan is extraordinarily common, given that Wuhan has appalling toxic air, which generates a lot of respiratory problems.
[00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:35.253]  And so when these first people started showing symptoms of illness, a handful of them were tested.
[00:50:36.073 --> 00:50:40.917]  And they took lung fluid and decided it was caused by a virus.
[00:50:41.818 --> 00:50:49.145]  But they never isolated and purified it in and of itself without any other contamination or genetic material.
[00:50:53.703 --> 00:51:11.652]  Now, if you're going to prove that a virus exists, and you're going to prove that that virus causes an alleged infectious disease, then purification and isolation of that viral material is an absolute solid gold foundation must-do.
[00:51:11.673 --> 00:51:14.214]  It's never been done.
[00:51:16.089 --> 00:51:24.317]  What you then had in those early days was COVID-19 being diagnosed on symptoms.
[00:51:24.898 --> 00:51:26.019]  And what were the symptoms?
[00:51:26.559 --> 00:51:28.461]  Flu-like symptoms.
[00:51:29.242 --> 00:51:30.383]  Flu-like symptoms?
[00:51:30.483 --> 00:51:32.345]  Respiratory symptoms in Wuhan?
[00:51:32.405 --> 00:51:33.587]  Are you having a laugh?
[00:51:34.465 --> 00:51:35.587]  But it was all on symptoms.
[00:51:36.208 --> 00:51:49.188]  And suddenly, symptoms that were coming from other sources up to that point, were re-designated this virus, which they'd never isolated, purified, and shown to exist.
[00:51:56.906 --> 00:52:11.831]  They then start developing this test called the PCR test, and the creator of the test, called Kerry Mullis, in the 1980s, actually said this test should not be used to diagnose infectious disease.
[00:52:12.911 --> 00:52:15.092]  But that's exactly what's happened ever since.
[00:52:18.877 --> 00:52:29.747]  So now they started adding to the diagnosis by symptoms with a PCR test that wasn't testing for the virus they were claiming to exist.
[00:52:29.787 --> 00:52:39.757]  It was testing for an RNA genetic material that was found in the lungs of those people, but has endless other sources and possibilities for why it's there.
[00:52:40.878 --> 00:52:42.920]  The key was the response.
[00:52:43.888 --> 00:52:56.222]  They wanted to have the Chinese response of a fierce, draconian lockdown to be the response of the rest of the world.
[00:52:57.355 --> 00:53:14.963]  The figures were going up of cases and deaths but the cases were coming from assumption of symptoms and a test not testing for the virus and the deaths were coming from this re-designation and the numbers went up.
[00:53:15.723 --> 00:53:22.486]  They were building hospitals in a matter of days to cope with the hysteria and the crisis.
[00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:27.569]  People were shown on video just collapsing in the street.
[00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:33.192]  Have you ever seen anyone collapse in the street in the West from the same virus?
[00:53:35.833 --> 00:53:42.557]  So they locked down these areas of China with absolute tyranny and inhumanity.
[00:53:43.502 --> 00:53:45.784]  And the numbers very quickly started falling.
[00:53:46.284 --> 00:53:56.333]  Which, when you're controlling the numbers by your diagnosis, and your tests not testing for the virus, is very easy to push the numbers up and then push the numbers down.
[00:53:56.833 --> 00:54:01.937]  Suddenly, these hospitals in next to no time that were built to cope with the crisis, they were shut.
[00:54:02.558 --> 00:54:12.146]  And you had the World Health Organization, via its Bill Gates-controlled director, General Tedros, who was being on the payroll of Gates' organization,
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:18.341]  He comes out and said China is the way for everyone else to respond.
[00:54:19.301 --> 00:54:21.142]  Gates came out and said something similar.
[00:54:21.842 --> 00:54:28.843]  And Gates has been the second biggest funder, second only to the government of the United States, of the World Health Organization.
[00:54:29.523 --> 00:54:36.445]  And if Trump carries through his threat to stop funding the WHO, then Gates will be the biggest funder.
[00:54:37.305 --> 00:54:37.965]  He owns it.
[00:54:39.305 --> 00:54:41.586]  And he owns Tedros, the Director General.
[00:54:45.566 --> 00:54:51.189]  So then, we start moving into the West, and the same process unfolded.
[00:54:51.830 --> 00:55:02.536]  As people were told, and the medical profession was told, this virus is spreading, they started to diagnose it on the basis of symptoms, just like in China.
[00:55:03.317 --> 00:55:10.201]  And then they introduced the PCR test, and it's not testing for the virus they say that it's testing for.
[00:55:11.513 --> 00:55:19.676]  The death numbers did not match what we were told about the deadly nature of this virus.
[00:55:20.516 --> 00:55:25.818]  And China was still a long way away in the minds of most people in the West.
[00:55:25.878 --> 00:55:30.019]  It was still somewhere on the other side of the world.
[00:55:31.359 --> 00:55:39.182]  What the cult needed was a Western example to frighten the hell out of Western people.
[00:55:40.014 --> 00:55:50.927]  They wanted and needed a COVID-19 crisis that Western people could relate to, to the point of, whoa, if it can happen there, it can happen here.
[00:55:51.909 --> 00:56:01.612]  And they chose Italy, an area called Lombardy, which is notorious for its toxic air and its respiratory disease, just like Wuhan.
[00:56:02.012 --> 00:56:03.873]  And the country was locked down.
[00:56:04.713 --> 00:56:20.359]  The official government figures in Italy revealed that 99% of people said to have died from COVID-19 had one or more other morbidity reasons to die.
[00:56:20.979 --> 00:56:30.264]  But everyone was now designated COVID-19, and there seemed to be a crisis when old people were dying of things that old people have always died from in that area.
[00:56:30.844 --> 00:56:41.130]  And a health spokesman for the Italian government would later come out and say, actually, we were, quote, generous on designating deaths as COVID-19.
[00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:46.933]  In his view, in truth, only about 12% of the people said to have died have died from COVID-19.
[00:56:48.013 --> 00:56:55.459]  And yet, the media were full of the hysteria to frighten the hell out of Western people.
[00:56:55.519 --> 00:56:58.502]  And so, in different countries, the same process unfolded.
[00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:03.966]  You had dark suits, not even politicians, driving the policy.
[00:57:04.367 --> 00:57:06.708]  Politicians were saying that we're being guided by the science.
[00:57:06.729 --> 00:57:08.490]  Well, who were the scientists?
[00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:15.296]  Well, in Britain, you have someone called Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, who has big financial connections to Bill Gates.
[00:57:16.161 --> 00:57:23.102]  In America, it was Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx that have big financial connections to Bill Gates.
[00:57:23.842 --> 00:57:35.384]  And because they didn't have the death numbers, they had to produce projections to justify the lockdowns, which were in the plan from the start, the Chinese response.
[00:57:35.925 --> 00:57:40.725]  So along comes Professor Neil Ferguson and Imperial College in London.
[00:57:41.426 --> 00:57:43.786]  Big financial connections to Bill Gates.
[00:57:44.912 --> 00:57:57.382]  With computer models projecting, ludicrously, anyone could see it at the time, that half a million people could die in Britain from this, quote, virus, and up to two million people in America.
[00:57:57.742 --> 00:58:06.549]  And as a result of that, the countries were locked down, because the computer modelers said, if you don't have lockdown, then this is what's going to happen.
[00:58:07.938 --> 00:58:13.910]  And lockdown has since killed far more people than any virus, even if you believe it exists.
[00:58:14.571 --> 00:58:16.294]  And it's transformed human society.
[00:58:17.105 --> 00:58:28.567]  And it's been done by this global web which operates in every country and controls the pharmaceutical health pyramids in each country.
[00:58:29.088 --> 00:58:39.550]  And the few at the top have had the same policy being driven from the center, the spider, which includes being told to designate almost anything that moves
[00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:45.834]  COVID-19 to the point where in the United States they even introduced financial incentives.
[00:58:46.535 --> 00:59:05.810]  So a hospital that diagnosed someone as regular pneumonia got $4,600 but you designate someone with the same symptoms COVID-19 pneumonia and you get $13,000 and if you put a COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed patient on a ventilator
[00:59:07.554 --> 00:59:14.071]  You get $39,000 and so many of these people put on ventilators for no reason have died.
[00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:23.603]  So that's the structure of how this pandemic, officially pandemic, hoax has been played.
[00:59:24.003 --> 00:59:33.346]  And it's what is driving the policy, day by day, to transform human society into what they call the new normal.
[00:59:33.866 --> 00:59:35.487]  The great reset.
[00:59:35.947 --> 00:59:39.748]  The great scam to transform life on Earth.
