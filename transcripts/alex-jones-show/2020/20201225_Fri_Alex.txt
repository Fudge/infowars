[00:00:02.531 --> 00:00:05.494]  Nurse Erin Marie Olszewski?
[00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:25.611]  It's going to be joining us coming up next segment when some of the stations join us.
[00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:26.952]  We really appreciate coming on.
[00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:31.256]  We had an amazing nurse call in earlier talking about basically COVID being an overblown fraud.
[00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:32.817]  She's a major whistleblower.
[00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:36.700]  We really appreciate coming up in a moment and then we'll continue on after she leaves and take your calls.
[00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:39.503]  All right now let's go to Old Dude in Missouri.
[00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.524]  Old Dude, thanks for holding.
[00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:40.764]  Go ahead.
[00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:45.306]  Folks, first off, man, hey, I just want to thank you for what you've done.
[00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:50.468]  I know you hear that a lot, but I've never had an opportunity to speak with you before, so I wanted to say that first and foremost.
[00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:53.390]  You've been very influential in a lot of people's lives.
[00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.013]  Second thing I want to say is the bodies and the X2 is amazing.
[00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:00.634]  I played football in college.
[00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:04.976]  I had some injuries, and the bodies allows me to do things that most people my age
[00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:12.720]  I mean, I went out and played flag football here a few weeks ago and was running with guys that were in their early 20s and I'm almost 40.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.121]  So the products are awesome.
[00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:25.286]  As far as what Donald Trump could do, one thing he could do is make a call out to all local law enforcement and militias to organize all able-bodied patriots, and now I realize he would be
[00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:26.927]  Well, I told
[00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:52.141]  I totally agree.
[00:01:52.181 --> 00:02:01.126]  We've got to politically weaponize like it's a war, and we can do it better than the bad guys, and literally start our own think tanks, our own groups, our own people, and then run our people.
[00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.587]  We'll kick the left's ass at that.
[00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:04.588]  They've all been secret in groups doing it.
[00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:05.609]  We won't be secret.
[00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:06.470]  We'll energize.
[00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.393]  We'll run people against Soros, putting in all his operatives at the DAs.
[00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.414]  This has got to be done.
[00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:15.054]  We've got to mobilize now.
[00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:16.515]  Total mobilization.
[00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:17.556]  Total commitment.
[00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:24.046]  Absolutely, and the people that are on our side of this, they need to understand the foundation of reality is on our side.
[00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:28.487]  The foundation of reality that God has put in place, it establishes our perspective.
[00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:36.930]  If people are going around and they don't even recognize and acknowledge that God is the creator of everything, then their perspective of reality is going to be
[00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.571]  We're good to go.
[00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:55.605]  Okay?
[00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:57.606]  It didn't just happen by accident.
[00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:00.007]  Every atheist on the planet is a liar.
[00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:04.069]  Nobody looks at those stars and thinks, hmm, that just happened by random chance.
[00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:23.437]  So people need to organize and they need to stand on the foundation of reality that God has provided us through Jesus Christ and the people who brought the message forth to the world and understand that we have God on our side because the literal essence of His truth is written in His words and communicated to humanity
[00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:24.757]  That's right, brother.
[00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:26.738]  It is a spiritual war and we see the enemy attacking.
[00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:28.599]  That's because the enemy, it knows it's in trouble.
[00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:29.939]  It's been forced out in the open.
[00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.960]  So as negative as this is at one level, I see it as very, very positive at others.
[00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:49.086]  Amen, amen.
[00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:55.451]  And hey, Alex, if I may, could I direct people to one video, and I have no monetary gain in it.
[00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:56.091]  Oh, I don't care, brother.
[00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:56.692]  Direct us to it.
[00:03:56.712 --> 00:03:57.112]  I don't care.
[00:03:57.292 --> 00:03:58.033]  Go ahead.
[00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:01.876]  It's Old Dude Perspective and Numbers on YouTube.
[00:04:02.703 --> 00:04:06.146]  Um, and Old Dude is O-L and then D-U-D-E.
[00:04:06.386 --> 00:04:07.607]  I'm just Old Dude, man.
[00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:12.331]  And I'm just out here trying to raise my family and trying to tell people the truth.
[00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:16.235]  And I've been like a lot of other people, and I kind of got lonely.
[00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:18.937]  And you want to hook up with others and form a resistance, and we love you.
[00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:19.477]  God bless you.
[00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:19.838]  Alright.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.142]  We've got our special guest straight ahead out of all these amazing whistleblowers.
[00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:25.903]  Hers was some of the most dynamic.
[00:04:26.143 --> 00:04:27.144]  In fact, probably the most.
[00:04:27.764 --> 00:04:31.286]  In there, showing the evidence, having the will to do it, having the courage.
[00:04:31.686 --> 00:04:34.848]  It's coming up because we're right back where we were six, eight months ago.
[00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:36.269]  Get ready to do it again.
[00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:43.414]  And so I'm going to try to really let her give you the unfiltered perspective because I know they have fought to suppress her information.
[00:04:43.454 --> 00:04:46.176]  Major Whistleblower Nurse from New York on the other side.
[00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:46.856]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:46.876 --> 00:04:47.957]  Tell everybody you know.
[00:04:48.117 --> 00:04:56.683]  Tune in now to m4wars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com

[00:05:14.228 --> 00:05:19.534]  It's absolutely an essential vitamin, meaning if you don't have it and you have a deficiency from it, you will die.
[00:05:20.114 --> 00:05:21.555]  The system doesn't want you to know this.
[00:05:21.575 --> 00:05:28.840]  They don't want you to know that they've lowered the allowance of what they claim you need every day to a level that makes you very, very sickly and easy to control.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.426]  But now we have a winner's sum of vitamin D3 and vitamin K that helps it upload better and is also excellent for your immune system at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:05:53.843 --> 00:05:57.066]  Again, Winter Sun at InfoWareStore.com is back in stock.
[00:05:58.027 --> 00:06:00.309]  Merry Christmas!
[00:06:14.804 --> 00:06:18.186]  The New World Order systems are dying right now.
[00:06:19.067 --> 00:06:21.809]  That's why they call themselves the New World Order, but they're not.
[00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.891]  We've got Nurse Olszewski joining us right now.
[00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:27.372]  Nurse Erin Marie Olszewski.
[00:06:28.994 --> 00:06:31.836]  She has spent her life fighting for freedom for everyday Americans.
[00:06:32.176 --> 00:06:33.176]  Young woman, she joined the U.S.
[00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:35.158]  Army to fight overseas in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
[00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:40.914]  Turning home, she turned her focus, drive, and dedication to defending our most deeply held values in American soil.
[00:06:41.355 --> 00:06:42.896]  She spent years fighting for medical freedom.
[00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:50.425]  In 2020, Erin volunteered with the front lines yet again by traveling nurse assigned to New York's Elmhurst Hospital, which has one of the highest death rates.
[00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:52.727]  We'll still talk about that during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:06:53.348 --> 00:06:58.012]  What she found horrified her and inspired a new focus of her advocacy.
[00:06:58.393 --> 00:07:09.563]  Erin's newly published book, The Undercover Epicenter Nurse, reveals how gross negligence, insurance fraud, medical malpractice, and good old-fashioned greed are killing everyday Americans at Elmhurst and beyond.
[00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:16.770]  Her new fight is a fight for return to ethics, transparency, and respect for truth values
[00:07:18.174 --> 00:07:19.055]  And she goes on from there.
[00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:20.496]  We're very, very excited to have her.
[00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:22.238]  She's at Nurse Erin.
[00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.080]  Nurse Erin with two E's.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.882]  And we really, again, are excited to have her.
[00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:29.644]  We've played her clips many times here.
[00:07:29.664 --> 00:07:32.626]  We'll get to some of those next segment where she actually shows the proof.
[00:07:32.987 --> 00:07:34.388]  Didn't just say it, but wow!
[00:07:34.868 --> 00:07:38.071]  Simply amazing with what really happened.
[00:07:38.472 --> 00:07:39.793]  So thank you for joining us.
[00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:40.914]  How should we start?
[00:07:41.454 --> 00:07:42.774]  Yeah, well, thank you for having me, Alex.
[00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:44.215]  First of all, I really appreciate it.
[00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:50.357]  There's not many that expose the truth like you, and a lot of people don't want to hear my story, especially the left-wing media.
[00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.638]  But I guess starting out, I mean...
[00:08:10.012 --> 00:08:12.054]  I guess originally I'm from Florida.
[00:08:12.094 --> 00:08:13.354]  That's where I reside now.
[00:08:13.515 --> 00:08:22.261]  So when this whole pandemic kind of first came crumbling down in March, you know, we were waiting for the wave in Florida and we just didn't see it.
[00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:26.524]  And all the while we're watching New York, you know, just get slammed.
[00:08:26.624 --> 00:08:29.746]  So as nurses, a lot of us were furloughed.
[00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:30.787]  We were looking for work.
[00:08:31.867 --> 00:08:36.268]  And an opportunity presented itself for me to travel to New York to help out.
[00:08:36.288 --> 00:08:38.168]  And so that's what I did.
[00:08:38.188 --> 00:08:43.069]  And, um, what I found there was unheard of.
[00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.770]  Um, ultimately what I found there was a whole lot of murder.
[00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.350]  And so I had no choice.
[00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:54.371]  Um, you know, in good conscience, I couldn't, you know, be part of the problem.
[00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.811]  I needed to be part of the solution.
[00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:58.452]  And that's why I decided to record it.
[00:08:59.348 --> 00:09:01.670]  And prove and share the truth with the people.
[00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:06.193]  And you didn't just make the claim this was basically murder.
[00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:07.153]  You showed the video.
[00:09:07.173 --> 00:09:09.215]  You showed the proof at your own risk.
[00:09:09.255 --> 00:09:14.498]  But whistleblowers are protected when they violate, quote, HIPAA or whatever by the fact that you're exposing a crime.
[00:09:14.998 --> 00:09:19.121]  The fact they didn't come after you, at least from my knowledge, shows how scared they are of this info.
[00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:21.983]  So when you say there's murder going on, walk through it.
[00:09:22.023 --> 00:09:22.883]  You've got the floor here.
[00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:27.126]  What you witnessed, what you saw, when the alarm bells rang, what you documented.
[00:09:28.973 --> 00:09:37.083]  Well, a lot of the public doesn't know, when I first got there, and I've been to war, I've been to Iraq, I know what being on the actual front lines in battle is.
[00:09:37.263 --> 00:09:40.186]  And so getting off the plane in New York, I sat around for three days.
[00:09:41.007 --> 00:09:42.269]  There was nurses that were before
[00:09:42.796 --> 00:09:51.141]  Got there before me that we're sitting there for up to three weeks, and we're getting paid $10,000 a week as nurses, which is a lot of money.
[00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:53.903]  In my opinion, I feel like it was hush money.
[00:09:53.923 --> 00:09:59.126]  A lot of nurses didn't want to say anything because they wanted their paycheck.
[00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:05.830]  But when I first got into the hospital, I was assigned to Elmhurst Hospital, which was ultimately the epicenter of the epicenter.
[00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:15.053]  And what they were doing is essentially admitting pretty much everyone, regardless if they had COVID or not, because there was a price tag.
[00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:20.716]  It was $13,000 to admit them to the floor, $39,000 to put them on a ventilator.
[00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:28.039]  Knowing that ventilators, by the time I got there in early April, had killed absolutely every single one of their patients.
[00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:32.661]  So this was essentially an assembly line to a body bag.
[00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:35.762]  You know, they come into the emergency room, they get admitted,
[00:10:36.124 --> 00:10:38.528]  To the floors regardless if they had COVID or not.
[00:10:47.608 --> 00:10:49.870]  Like Mayberry with Barney Five.
[00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.892]  You'd been in combat hospitals.
[00:10:51.912 --> 00:10:53.533]  You'd seen arms and legs blown off.
[00:10:53.614 --> 00:10:55.315]  People shot with RPGs.
[00:10:55.715 --> 00:11:04.383]  You'd seen real trauma, real war, real desperate working 18 hours a day sometimes during battles versus you're sitting around your hotel room getting 10 grand.
[00:11:04.924 --> 00:11:06.886]  So right up front, you're thinking something's weird here.
[00:11:08.847 --> 00:11:09.968]  Yeah, it was a red flag.
[00:11:10.029 --> 00:11:11.570]  I mean, this was not a war zone.
[00:11:12.054 --> 00:11:15.737]  And even when I got into the hospitals, we were well-staffed.
[00:11:15.797 --> 00:11:20.561]  I can imagine in the very beginning they weren't, but by the time I got there, they were well-staffed.
[00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:22.622]  And then it was the treatment.
[00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:28.827]  In my hospital, our governor, Governor Ron DeSantis, did not ban the hydroxychloroquine.
[00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:34.051]  And when we got to New York, I realized that Cuomo did.
[00:11:34.992 --> 00:11:37.434]  And we had saved every single one of our patients.
[00:11:37.514 --> 00:11:39.936]  So when they weren't using alternative treatments,
[00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:44.691]  And the protocol that they were using was ventilators, knowing it was killing every single patient.
[00:11:44.711 --> 00:11:45.892]  That was another red flag.
[00:11:46.452 --> 00:11:47.593]  Why are they banning treatment?
[00:11:47.613 --> 00:11:50.654]  Since when did the government get in between a doctor-patient relationship?
[00:11:50.734 --> 00:11:51.655]  That's unheard of.
[00:11:52.055 --> 00:11:53.496]  And it actually should never happen again.
[00:11:54.336 --> 00:11:56.097]  The hospitals were all liability free.
[00:11:56.157 --> 00:12:01.380]  So regardless of what a doctor, a nurse, any part of the staff members did, they would never be liable.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.640]  And they took advantage of that.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.742]  They took advantage of a system that wasn't going to hold them liable.
[00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.271]  And you know, there was financial incentive to stay quiet.
[00:12:10.371 --> 00:12:14.073]  So I was there, gosh, not even a week.
[00:12:14.473 --> 00:12:17.975]  And I was just devastated.
[00:12:18.515 --> 00:12:27.818]  And I contacted attorneys that I knew in New York and I'm like, I need to do something because there were nurses that were speaking out before me and no one believed them.
[00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:32.880]  You know, so I needed the actual proof and you know, it wouldn't be the first time I've been undercover.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.041]  I, I was undercover.
[00:12:34.602 --> 00:12:41.385]  You know, in Iraq too, so maybe that's what kind of motivated me to not be afraid to be able to expose this corruption.
[00:12:42.385 --> 00:12:56.111]  And, you know, ultimately, a lot of these patients, the majority of these patients died unnecessarily, and their families deserve to know the truth, and these patients deserve justice.
[00:12:56.992 --> 00:13:05.237]  And so we've got time to take your time to go through that because you did a great job on Tucker Carlson and other platforms, but those were short interviews.
[00:13:05.677 --> 00:13:15.023]  Walk through then what it was like and how you were quantifying that they were killing people because you show where someone doesn't have COVID, but still they intubate them.
[00:13:15.063 --> 00:13:16.784]  And then days later, a healthy person's dead.
[00:13:16.824 --> 00:13:18.865]  I mean, and of course, even U.S.
[00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:22.647]  Today admits if they intubate somebody, they would get all this extra money.
[00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:25.369]  Well,
[00:13:25.942 --> 00:13:28.624]  Let's just say that you walk in and this happened a lot.
[00:13:28.764 --> 00:13:32.067]  I mean, even today it's happening and people have a lot of anxiety.
[00:13:32.147 --> 00:13:36.030]  They're terrified of this virus that the media is instilling, like this fear.
[00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.392]  And they're coming in like, oh my gosh, I'm having difficulty breathing.
[00:13:39.432 --> 00:13:40.073]  What do I do?
[00:13:40.613 --> 00:13:44.116]  And in Florida, we would say, you know, you're all right.
[00:13:44.476 --> 00:13:46.137]  We would test them for the flu first.
[00:13:46.257 --> 00:13:47.598]  Rule out other things.
[00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:49.360]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.701]  Not in New York.
[00:13:50.781 --> 00:13:55.204]  So if you walk through the emergency room in New York, you're going to be a COVID quote rule out.
[00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:56.411]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:17.286]  You know, there was no accountability.
[00:14:17.526 --> 00:14:23.408]  And even if you said anything, which I tried to go up my chain of command and everybody told me to hush or I would go home.
[00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.268]  And they did send quite a few nurses home.
[00:14:25.348 --> 00:14:27.869]  Ultimately, I was sent home as well.
[00:14:28.529 --> 00:14:35.912]  But there were patients, a full code is when you want to be saved, your family wants you to be saved.
[00:14:36.492 --> 00:14:40.193]  Nurses and doctors will perform CPR as long as it takes to save you.
[00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.814]  That was not happening.
[00:14:42.284 --> 00:14:49.448]  There were doctors that were writing patients off as dead with the time of death paperwork done before they were even dead.
[00:14:50.048 --> 00:14:53.991]  And then telling us nurses, don't code them, they're going to die anyway.
[00:14:54.171 --> 00:15:04.777]  That's just the most unethical malpractice type of situation that any nurse or any medical professional
[00:15:05.635 --> 00:15:06.716]  Should ever have to be in.
[00:15:06.776 --> 00:15:11.779]  But they felt like, in those certain hospitals that had almost all the deaths, they were allowed to.
[00:15:11.819 --> 00:15:21.044]  Then you've got them sending sick patients to nursing homes, but not letting family go in, and then intubating them there and also getting high death numbers, up to half the deaths in New York.
[00:15:21.124 --> 00:15:23.866]  I mean, this looks like a very organized operation.
[00:15:25.607 --> 00:15:26.348]  Well, it was.
[00:15:26.748 --> 00:15:30.210]  You know, the orders were coming down from Cuomo, essentially.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.741]  And they were going to the administrators.
[00:15:32.941 --> 00:15:35.743]  The administrators, they all knew what was going on.
[00:15:35.923 --> 00:15:41.887]  And that's why they would threaten us so hard that if we said anything, we would immediately go home.
[00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.288]  You know, we were all on gag orders.
[00:15:43.368 --> 00:15:43.668]  Why?
[00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:46.490]  You know, and this financial incentive... But all of this is so huge.
[00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:46.930]  Stay right there.
[00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:47.691]  Back in a few minutes.
[00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:48.491]  Simply amazing.
[00:15:48.571 --> 00:15:51.774]  One of the main whistleblower nurses videoed it all, documented it all.
[00:15:52.134 --> 00:15:52.974]  She's here explaining.
[00:15:53.174 --> 00:15:54.635]  Most of the nurses were like, this is BS.
[00:15:54.675 --> 00:15:55.356]  They were sent home.
[00:15:55.676 --> 00:15:59.859]  So they bring in people statistically and build an army of folks that will do anything.
[00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:03.661]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[00:16:03.722 --> 00:16:07.524]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[00:16:07.965 --> 00:16:17.372]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[00:16:17.412 --> 00:16:18.012]  They are going to explode.
[00:16:18.072 --> 00:16:18.593]  We're good.
[00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:36.352]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[00:16:36.372 --> 00:16:37.572]  Thank you for holding.
[00:16:37.592 --> 00:16:37.972]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.211]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:07.451]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[00:17:07.472 --> 00:17:07.812]  How are you?
[00:17:08.192 --> 00:17:08.872]  I love you, man.
[00:17:08.972 --> 00:17:10.933]  I want to make a quick plug.
[00:17:10.953 --> 00:17:13.135]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[00:17:13.175 --> 00:17:29.624]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[00:17:30.296 --> 00:17:34.659]  And it helped channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:48.869]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[00:17:49.209 --> 00:17:53.893]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[00:17:53.913 --> 00:17:55.374]  So thanks for the plug.
[00:18:53.721 --> 00:19:00.126]  Ho, ho, ho, ho!
[00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:00.946]  Merry Christmas!
[00:19:00.986 --> 00:19:06.871]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:08.772]  We've got two different big sales.
[00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:15.137]  We've got Super Metal Vitality Turbo Force and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[00:19:15.217 --> 00:19:20.721]  We've got Bodies, Vazzo Beats, and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack,
[00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:21.281]  I think so.
[00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:55.344]  Again, the year 2021 is here, and I am committed to you to fight against the globalists harder than ever, so thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight.
[00:19:55.484 --> 00:19:57.245]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[00:20:03.047 --> 00:20:08.929]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:28.393]  Nurse Erin Marie Olszewski is our guest with the book that Big Brother doesn't want you to read.
[00:20:28.473 --> 00:20:29.113]  You should get it.
[00:20:29.894 --> 00:20:33.276]  Share it with everyone you know to save lives and to stop this fraud.
[00:20:33.756 --> 00:20:34.997]  Undercover Epicenter.
[00:20:36.898 --> 00:20:38.139]  Undercover Epicenter nurse.
[00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:44.263]  How fraud, negligence, and greed led to unnecessary deaths at Elmhurst Hospital.
[00:20:45.023 --> 00:20:46.544]  And boy, she lays it all out.
[00:20:48.999 --> 00:21:03.725]  So, please continue with what you're laying out, how long you were there, the aftermath of it, and what's in your book and what you expect to see obviously now with this winter when they have more flu, more pneumonia.
[00:21:03.745 --> 00:21:05.986]  They're obviously going to try to attribute all that to COVID.
[00:21:06.006 --> 00:21:07.666]  They said that the lockdown has to go on forever.
[00:21:08.186 --> 00:21:17.030]  They don't want people to know about nutraceuticals or about supplements or about vitamin D. And give us your big picture of what you think is really going on here and what we should all do to stop it.
[00:21:19.997 --> 00:21:20.837]  A lot's going on.
[00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:26.839]  Yes, that's one thing that they banned is any alternative treatments.
[00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:44.722]  They didn't talk about the high-dose IV vitamin C. They didn't talk about the hydroxychloroquine, you know, quercetin, vitamin D, vitamin C, you know, like a lot of these things that people really need to know is everything that they're not talking about.
[00:21:45.563 --> 00:21:47.083]  And for a virus,
[00:21:47.879 --> 00:21:54.280]  With a 99, at this point, 0.9% survival rate, we don't need a vaccine.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.141]  And the vaccine is very dangerous.
[00:21:57.841 --> 00:22:01.821]  And ultimately, I think that this has been about control.
[00:22:02.382 --> 00:22:04.722]  I think that this has been about the election.
[00:22:05.442 --> 00:22:10.663]  And I think that this is about, honestly, the New World Order.
[00:22:10.883 --> 00:22:16.264]  You know, they want puppets, and they don't want anybody
[00:22:17.028 --> 00:22:23.289]  Like myself or, you know, any of other whistleblowers to be telling the people the truth.
[00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:38.972]  And ultimately, if we want to secure a safe future for our children and future generations, a lot more people need to stand up and speak up and tell the truth because this is about humanity at the end of the day.
[00:22:39.212 --> 00:22:43.113]  And we need to be able to save lives and get the truth to the people.
[00:22:44.474 --> 00:22:58.445]  What was it like for you as a whistleblower, not at the very start, but I'd say in the first third of people really speaking out, to then watch all these prominent scientists and doctors and nurses, including yourself, being censored by big tech?
[00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:00.727]  I mean, since when do consumer reviews get blocked?
[00:23:01.027 --> 00:23:03.209]  Since when can medical professionals not have their speech?
[00:23:03.469 --> 00:23:04.370]  This is so dangerous.
[00:23:06.112 --> 00:23:07.413]  No, it's extremely dangerous.
[00:23:07.533 --> 00:23:11.196]  And, you know, all these people that you're seeing, you know,
[00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:15.223]  These are medical experts, Fauci being one.
[00:23:16.703 --> 00:23:18.204]  These guys never had boots on the ground.
[00:23:18.244 --> 00:23:20.966]  These guys never actually treated any of these patients.
[00:23:21.006 --> 00:23:23.107]  These guys were not in there.
[00:23:23.127 --> 00:23:23.967]  I was.
[00:23:24.308 --> 00:23:25.868]  We were the ones with boots on the ground.
[00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:29.550]  And for anybody like me, that was actually there.
[00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:37.715]  And that's actually, you know, telling them what they really did in order to create this mass genocide.
[00:23:38.514 --> 00:23:40.176]  Um, you know, we're, we're hushed.
[00:23:40.256 --> 00:23:40.977]  We're censored.
[00:23:40.997 --> 00:23:42.398]  Um, I've been fired.
[00:23:42.518 --> 00:23:43.619]  I was fired in New York.
[00:23:43.699 --> 00:23:50.225]  I was fired from my job here in Florida because they don't want people like me inside there's hospital walls because we're going to tell the truth.
[00:23:50.626 --> 00:23:52.187]  They kicked all the family members out.
[00:23:53.589 --> 00:23:55.731]  It's a free for all in these hospitals right now.
[00:23:55.891 --> 00:24:02.057]  And, and since my expo day came out, I've had so many people from around the world contact me.
[00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:03.844]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:22.658]  And be a nurse in this time in history right now.
[00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:29.643]  And well, it seems like a total power grab where we can let COVID patients into the nursing home, but you can't see your mom or dad for six, eight months.
[00:24:30.203 --> 00:24:38.909]  It's such a control thing that all over the world now, uh, you know, you can't see your family members, but, but then they can do whatever they want behind closed doors.
[00:24:38.969 --> 00:24:40.830]  Sounds like a recipe for major abuse.
[00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:44.613]  Well, and why aren't they talking, you know, about.
[00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:53.611]  The increase in suicide, the increase in depression, all of these other things that are happening outside, they're just not discussing.
[00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:55.652]  Everything is COVID.
[00:24:56.012 --> 00:24:57.232]  There's no flu anymore.
[00:24:57.792 --> 00:25:04.674]  There's no other diseases or illnesses right now.
[00:25:04.734 --> 00:25:06.495]  It's just all COVID.
[00:25:07.655 --> 00:25:12.336]  And that has to send a red flag to people.
[00:25:12.837 --> 00:25:13.737]  And I hope it does.
[00:25:14.873 --> 00:25:21.718]  Wake up a whole lot more people to kind of start asking questions, because ultimately we need to be inquisitive.
[00:25:21.838 --> 00:25:23.840]  We need to demand the truth.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.383]  And you know, it's just something that the media isn't, isn't giving the people.
[00:25:28.523 --> 00:25:31.545]  And these photos that you're sharing right now, it's just heartbreaking.
[00:25:32.446 --> 00:25:38.090]  And how are we ever going to dig ourselves out of this and, you know, become
[00:25:39.657 --> 00:25:43.419]  Kind of fight this new normal that they're trying to push on everybody.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.260]  You know, there's nothing normal about this.
[00:25:45.701 --> 00:25:52.045]  And it's the way they script it all, like, teaching the kids all this weird bizarreness that you can't hold each other or love each other.
[00:25:52.065 --> 00:25:53.485]  Everything's like a cult.
[00:25:53.906 --> 00:25:55.126]  You can't see grandma now.
[00:25:55.187 --> 00:25:56.727]  This is Milgram experiment.
[00:25:57.108 --> 00:25:58.649]  Stanford research experiment.
[00:25:58.689 --> 00:26:00.430]  This is real mind control.
[00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.690]  Then you read Klaus Schwab.
[00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:02.811]  I don't know if you've seen that.
[00:26:02.831 --> 00:26:05.133]  The Davos Group admitting, oh, COVID's not a threat.
[00:26:05.413 --> 00:26:08.675]  This is the rollout of our global corporate takeover and our global ID.
[00:26:11.147 --> 00:26:12.288]  No, you're exactly right.
[00:26:12.388 --> 00:26:17.592]  And, you know, there are more and more medical professionals speaking up about this.
[00:26:17.772 --> 00:26:20.995]  And, you know, eventually there's going to be too many of us to ignore.
[00:26:21.075 --> 00:26:22.496]  And I hope that that's the case.
[00:26:22.796 --> 00:26:24.898]  And, you know, I'm going to continue the fight.
[00:26:25.138 --> 00:26:30.302]  And, you know, there's other doctors and nurses that are stepping up and saying, you know what?
[00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:32.043]  Enough is enough.
[00:26:32.344 --> 00:26:33.825]  You know, we can't lie anymore.
[00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:41.015]  Go ahead and take our license because I don't honestly want to be a part of this system if this is how it's going to be.
[00:26:41.075 --> 00:26:54.044]  I'd rather be on the outside and helping people, you know, try to avoid this, whatever it is that they're trying to do to, you know, just innocent people right now.
[00:26:55.845 --> 00:26:59.047]  Well, I was really impressed with the videos you shot and what you did.
[00:26:59.107 --> 00:27:00.168]  We'll show those next segment.
[00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:03.411]  And the fact that what you said has been proven out was going on.
[00:27:03.731 --> 00:27:07.614]  And we did see some reform up front because of you and other whistleblowers.
[00:27:07.654 --> 00:27:13.358]  But now I see the same, as you said, murderous, out-of-control tactics coming back in this winter.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.622]  Yeah, well, we already knew that a second wave was coming.
[00:27:18.662 --> 00:27:22.165]  And that's kind of why I needed to get that expose out.
[00:27:22.225 --> 00:27:23.386]  I needed to get the book out.
[00:27:24.071 --> 00:27:28.713]  Knowledge is power, and people need to know what to do right now in order to fight back.
[00:27:29.073 --> 00:27:34.135]  First things first, family members need to be allowed in these hospital rooms.
[00:27:34.495 --> 00:27:48.460]  And if that's not allowed, you know, if masks honestly work, which they don't, there's no science to back that up, then let the family members put on a mask and go visit their loved ones and be able to advocate for them, because that's where a lot of things go wrong.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.461]  You know, even on good days in hospitals, it's very bad.
[00:27:51.874 --> 00:27:54.336]  And it's been bad for a really, really long time.
[00:27:54.696 --> 00:28:09.606]  And I think this may be kind of the catalyst to change and, you know, a reform in ethics and, you know, be able to advocate for your loved ones and have a backup if that's not possible.
[00:28:09.866 --> 00:28:13.889]  Maybe in the form of, you know, nurses like myself to be able to go in there.
[00:28:14.409 --> 00:28:17.531]  If you need a degree in order to go into these hospitals, then so be it.
[00:28:19.107 --> 00:28:22.048]  Well, we need prosecution of Bill Gates and the U.N.
[00:28:22.068 --> 00:28:24.809]  and these big corporations rolling out their forced inoculations.
[00:28:25.089 --> 00:28:25.709]  But we come back.
[00:28:25.729 --> 00:28:26.629]  You've already alluded to this.
[00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:27.489]  You shot the proof.
[00:28:27.849 --> 00:28:33.911]  When you say they were murdering people, we're going to lay that out with Nurse Erin Marie on the other side.
[00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:37.072]  At Nurse Erin with two E's.
[00:28:37.472 --> 00:28:41.513]  And we'll tell you other places to find her book, which I know they've been trying to block.
[00:28:41.933 --> 00:28:43.093]  But this is so important.
[00:28:43.133 --> 00:28:44.994]  Listeners, I know you know this stuff.
[00:28:45.731 --> 00:28:48.653]  Or you know most of it, but your friends and neighbors and family don't.
[00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:56.199]  So, I would suggest you all get copies of this and give it to your local hospitals, because that will trigger a major debate that's already happening inside.
[00:28:56.559 --> 00:28:57.560]  We've got to expose this.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.481]  This is high-tech.
[00:29:00.726 --> 00:29:04.207]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[00:29:04.407 --> 00:29:13.910]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big pharma are all pushing the cub as the most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.231]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[00:29:17.351 --> 00:29:19.432]  That's why you see somebody dying in southern nursing homes.
[00:29:19.952 --> 00:29:29.555]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones,
[00:29:29.735 --> 00:29:29.995]  I don't know.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.241]  Kurt in Oklahoma.
[00:30:02.281 --> 00:30:02.882]  Kurt, welcome.
[00:30:04.724 --> 00:30:14.934]  There is nothing better, nothing more comfy than waking up, saying a prayer, brewing a cup of Wake Up America Patriot Blend, and calling in to the American Journal.
[00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:15.935]  That's right, sir.
[00:30:15.975 --> 00:30:16.956]  Well, we're honored to be here.
[00:30:16.996 --> 00:30:17.997]  We're glad to be taking your calls.
[00:30:18.037 --> 00:30:20.140]  What is your view on this situation with the vaccines?
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:29.325]  So my wife and I were talking about the COVID vaccine the other day, and we're of course against it, but we're planning on trying to have our first kid.
[00:30:29.345 --> 00:30:30.425]  We're trying right now.
[00:30:30.826 --> 00:30:38.330]  And we got to talking about all the societal pressure that's baked in around the COVID vaccine, but really any given vaccine.
[00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:45.894]  You know, not being able to have kids go to school if they're not vaccinated, not being able to do certain things, work certain places.
[00:30:46.134 --> 00:30:46.374]  And we got
[00:30:46.374 --> 00:30:46.614]  We're good.
[00:31:01.451 --> 00:31:01.991]  I think so.
[00:31:21.138 --> 00:31:45.888]  We're getting it out there, and that's good, but what we really need to do is figure out a way to attack culturally this anti-intellectual, anti-free-thinking culture, whether that's through art, whether that's through prayer, whether that's through our own movies and TV shows, because really the only way we're going to stop and save everyone else from getting these vaccines, I mean, we're already going to be fine.
[00:31:45.928 --> 00:31:46.848]  We are informed.
[00:31:47.368 --> 00:31:50.312]  We're not going to take these vaccines, even if they try to force it on us.
[00:31:50.532 --> 00:31:51.834]  We're going to die one way or the other.
[00:31:51.894 --> 00:31:55.338]  I totally agree, but it's up to us to keep on living, to keep on having children.
[00:31:55.378 --> 00:32:03.227]  And just like these towns in Washington State and other places that are pulling out, saying we're not following any of your lies, we'll have towns without 5G.
[00:32:03.547 --> 00:32:04.869]  We'll have towns without cell phones.
[00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:05.489]  We'll have towns...
[00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.932]  We're Christian, but we're open to others.
[00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:10.974]  It's just all about we have rules and laws that are pro-human.
[00:32:11.354 --> 00:32:13.236]  And what you're saying is the total future.
[00:32:13.636 --> 00:32:21.123]  And everything about the left is a bullying, submission culture of raping us with their ideas, raping us with their poison vaccines.
[00:32:21.423 --> 00:32:24.826]  Why do you think California passed a law you can give somebody HIV and not get in trouble?
[00:32:25.186 --> 00:32:26.547]  They want to rape you.
[00:32:26.827 --> 00:32:28.148]  They want to infect you.
[00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:31.011]  They want to bring you down the way they are, Kurt.
[00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:32.192]  Exactly.
[00:32:32.592 --> 00:32:41.938]  And most people go along to get along just because they're so invested with getting that next paycheck to go see the latest movie or to buy the newest video game.
[00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:43.900]  It's all economic for these people.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.582]  They just want to, you know, focus on... It's all Pavlovian.
[00:32:47.622 --> 00:32:48.163]  Call me back.
[00:32:48.223 --> 00:32:48.883]  We love you, Kurt.
[00:32:48.963 --> 00:32:49.984]  Incredible callers!
[00:32:50.484 --> 00:32:51.485]  We got such good callers.
[00:32:51.505 --> 00:32:53.126]  We're actually getting to them.
[00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:58.610]  Watch The American Journal weekday mornings 8 to 11 central at band.video.
[00:33:02.253 --> 00:33:08.197]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.784 --> 00:33:25.148]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.089 --> 00:33:28.470]  Nurse Erin Marie Olszewski is our guest.
[00:33:29.431 --> 00:33:30.472]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:31.816 --> 00:33:34.338]  And I've studied this a lot more than I want to.
[00:33:34.358 --> 00:33:36.280]  I'm telling you what she's saying is dead on.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.502]  I've had medical doctors on, scientists on.
[00:33:39.362 --> 00:33:41.824]  The vast majority come out and say this is a total fraud.
[00:33:41.844 --> 00:33:42.325]  It's a scam.
[00:33:42.365 --> 00:33:47.589]  And then they try to fire medical doctors that run major hospitals for saying what she's saying right now.
[00:33:48.129 --> 00:33:52.713]  But as you heard her say, more and more of the doctors and nurses are refusing to be part of this fraud.
[00:33:53.554 --> 00:33:55.255]  People need to read your book.
[00:33:55.295 --> 00:33:56.176]  This is life and death.
[00:33:56.436 --> 00:33:58.018]  Where's the best place for folks to get
[00:33:58.918 --> 00:34:01.601]  Your newly published book, The Undercover Epicenter Nurse.
[00:34:03.142 --> 00:34:08.887]  You can get it on any, you know, online store, Amazon, Barnes & Noble.
[00:34:08.987 --> 00:34:13.211]  I have a personal signed copy link in the link that I gave you.
[00:34:13.271 --> 00:34:15.313]  It's the link tree at Nurse Erin.
[00:34:16.313 --> 00:34:22.459]  And then, yeah, it's not out in retail stores yet because they just don't want to carry it.
[00:34:23.285 --> 00:34:28.936]  Well obviously we need to override them and get that out there, and you've also paid a lot getting fired for telling the truth.
[00:34:29.417 --> 00:34:31.802]  Again, give us that URL for Radiolisters.
[00:34:31.822 --> 00:34:32.503]  We're not just TV.
[00:34:32.543 --> 00:34:35.288]  Give them audibly where they can find the book to support you.
[00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:45.126]  If you go to my Instagram at Aaron underscore BSN, there's a link in my bio for a signed copy.
[00:34:45.386 --> 00:34:47.548]  People need to get the signed copy.
[00:34:48.108 --> 00:34:54.734]  They need to give it to friends and family because again, I sit there and I talk to people and I go, hey, they just found HIV insertions.
[00:34:56.207 --> 00:34:57.948]  In the vaccine, they go, oh, you're a liar.
[00:34:57.968 --> 00:34:59.909]  Then I show them the Indian study, they go, oh, wow.
[00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:01.730]  Then I show them Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:06.852]  They just stopped the vaccine all over Australia because they were doing HIV positive tests.
[00:35:06.872 --> 00:35:08.153]  Well, I'm not a doctor.
[00:35:08.173 --> 00:35:09.794]  I had scientists on 10 months ago.
[00:35:09.834 --> 00:35:17.177]  They predicted that if somebody really made a vaccine for this, it would give you HIV positive because part of this COVID thing is HIV.
[00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:20.659]  But we'll talk about that, come up in a few minutes with the vaccines and your view on that.
[00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:23.280]  Let's get into the death here.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.541]  Let's talk about that.
[00:35:25.868 --> 00:35:27.509]  Let's go ahead and play this clip number one.
[00:35:27.529 --> 00:35:31.052]  This is footage you valiantly shot, because you can get in a lot of trouble for this, folks.
[00:35:31.092 --> 00:35:32.813]  But, you know, she was showing a crime, so she's covered.
[00:35:33.393 --> 00:35:42.880]  Nurse Erin shows how people who repeatedly tested negative are tested over and over again to say they have COVID to code them while they intubate them to get that money.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.381]  Here it is.
[00:35:43.781 --> 00:35:49.325]  The people who had repeatedly tested negative for COVID were being described as COVID confirmed.
[00:35:49.966 --> 00:35:52.448]  Okay, so if you look close, I'm in my patient's chart.
[00:35:53.289 --> 00:35:55.971]  I am pulling up their laboratory results.
[00:35:56.091 --> 00:36:00.515]  So if you look here, you'll see COVID-19 bio-reference lab.
[00:36:02.817 --> 00:36:04.418]  Here are the test results.
[00:36:04.538 --> 00:36:06.600]  As you can see, 5-1-2020 at 17-16, not detected.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.243]  We test for a second time, 5-4-2020 at 17-59, not detected.
[00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:20.880]  So both of those are negative.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.820]  Scroll up to the top.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.141]  This is my patient.
[00:36:25.361 --> 00:36:31.303]  They are on a vent and they are being called COVID-19 confirmed.
[00:36:31.643 --> 00:36:34.144]  Droplet in contact and eye protection.
[00:36:34.164 --> 00:36:39.286]  So this person is droplet in eye.
[00:36:41.567 --> 00:36:42.947]  COVID confirmed.
[00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:46.408]  Positive A. Click.
[00:36:47.549 --> 00:36:48.449]  Not detected.
[00:36:49.405 --> 00:36:55.027]  No results in lab.
[00:36:55.067 --> 00:36:56.527]  Pretty good.
[00:36:56.867 --> 00:37:08.351]  While Erin was using her hidden camera to document another chart showing a patient with negative test results, who nonetheless was labeled COVID-confirmed, another travel nurse entered the room.
[00:37:09.011 --> 00:37:11.071]  They began to discuss what Erin was seeing.
[00:37:11.091 --> 00:37:12.452]  That says bio-reference?
[00:37:12.512 --> 00:37:13.912]  That means it's done here.
[00:37:14.052 --> 00:37:16.933]  So not detected here, but it's presumpted.
[00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:20.850]  Now, they're all... They are detectives.
[00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.410]  They're saying it's positive.
[00:37:22.791 --> 00:37:23.671]  Not detectives.
[00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:26.712]  But it's not detectives.
[00:37:26.752 --> 00:37:41.336]  You said that they were vented immediately upon being brought in, is that... Yeah, so the thing is, is they're coming in with difficulty breathing and a lot of these patients are really coming in with anxiety because everybody is, they're scared.
[00:37:43.274 --> 00:37:47.197]  And I know in other clips you show where the guy's healthy, they intubate him and he's dead a couple days later.
[00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:48.618]  Absolutely insane.
[00:37:48.678 --> 00:37:51.461]  Again, watching this, this is real world.
[00:37:51.841 --> 00:37:56.805]  I would expect the FBI to be SWAT teaming and getting all the evidence, but of course it doesn't happen.
[00:37:56.845 --> 00:38:06.132]  But then in Michigan, where medical doctors were giving folks preventatively IV vitamin C, which studies show is basically bulletproof, they got SWAT teamed.
[00:38:06.212 --> 00:38:11.577]  So, giving people vitamin C, you can SWAT team, killing them with ventilation when they don't need it, that's good.
[00:38:13.502 --> 00:38:14.463]  It's insanity.
[00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:19.026]  It's literally what was happening there is the definition of insanity.
[00:38:19.326 --> 00:38:23.929]  Like, doing the same thing over and over and over and expecting different results.
[00:38:24.049 --> 00:38:26.831]  Although, I don't think that they ever expected different results.
[00:38:27.231 --> 00:38:33.115]  I think that the results that were happening with 100% death rate is exactly what they wanted.
[00:38:33.135 --> 00:38:34.656]  They wanted the numbers up.
[00:38:34.796 --> 00:38:38.359]  They wanted to create this mass hysteria pandemic.
[00:38:38.799 --> 00:38:41.361]  And ultimately, they wanted to be right.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.361]  You know, how did Cuomo Nota order 30,000 vents in March?
[00:38:46.362 --> 00:38:52.904]  When there was doctors that came out, Dr. Cameron Kyle Siddell said in March, it's the wrong treatment protocol.
[00:38:53.184 --> 00:38:53.745]  They didn't care.
[00:38:53.785 --> 00:38:54.765]  They continued to do it.
[00:38:55.105 --> 00:38:57.626]  They didn't hire enough people to run these ventilators.
[00:38:57.986 --> 00:39:05.049]  You know, there was residents that had never had experience with hands-on with their patients running the floors.
[00:39:05.269 --> 00:39:10.531]  You know, there was so many times I had to lock my IV pump so they wouldn't come in and change it and kill my patients.
[00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.031]  You know, it was terrifying.
[00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:18.493]  Ultimately, it was one big experiment for a lot of these student doctors.
[00:39:18.973 --> 00:39:37.241]  They were performing invasive tests on these patients, and these patients were essentially in a medically-induced coma, had no idea what was going on, and they treated them like they weren't even human beings, you know?
[00:39:37.261 --> 00:39:39.762]  Well, you said earlier—keep going, please, Nars.
[00:39:42.142 --> 00:39:44.123]  They're like, oh, the person's alive, just say they're dead.
[00:39:44.163 --> 00:39:45.124]  We're killing them, basically.
[00:39:45.164 --> 00:39:46.645]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:39:47.525 --> 00:39:49.647]  Yeah, and I have that recorded.
[00:39:50.567 --> 00:39:59.613]  The doctor literally is telling all of us nurses to, you know, he was essentially playing God, and he was called out for playing God.
[00:39:59.793 --> 00:40:00.814]  You know, you're not God.
[00:40:01.154 --> 00:40:02.775]  And he said, well, I am.
[00:40:02.795 --> 00:40:08.519]  You know, it's just... Let's start over there, because this sounds like Joseph Mingolo's
[00:40:09.682 --> 00:40:09.842]  Yeah.
[00:40:34.073 --> 00:40:39.876]  You know, and if they don't follow their orders, you know, this was a bunch of order followers, ultimately.
[00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:44.859]  And if they don't follow the orders, they're going to be fired and they'll likely lose their license.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.981]  If they do the right thing, they will lose their license.
[00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:50.122]  You know, that's, I did the right thing.
[00:40:50.142 --> 00:40:53.764]  You know, nurses, doctors, we're all mandatory reporters.
[00:40:53.824 --> 00:40:54.524]  It's our oath.
[00:40:54.805 --> 00:40:55.885]  You know, that's what we sign up.
[00:40:55.905 --> 00:40:57.986]  We are ultimately for the patient.
[00:40:58.026 --> 00:40:59.207]  We are for nobody else.
[00:40:59.267 --> 00:41:00.768]  We are there to protect the patient.
[00:41:01.408 --> 00:41:13.151]  And it's so backwards, society is so backwards, that if you're a nurse or a doctor trying to save your patients' lives and being like, listen, we're doing it wrong, we need to change this, you're fired.
[00:41:13.171 --> 00:41:15.252]  Wow.
[00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:26.375]  I just can't comprehend that this is the United States of America, a country that is supposed to be one of the best countries in the world, and we are not setting a good example.
[00:41:26.897 --> 00:41:34.722]  Well, if a serial killer had grabbed little kids or a woman and was putting tubes down their throat and killing them, like Jeffrey Dahmer did with acid, then it'd be a horror story.
[00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:35.102]  It'd be terrible.
[00:41:35.122 --> 00:41:47.810]  But if it's the doctors, and it's Fauci, and it's the governor, Cuomo, and as you said, it was all so premeditated, this is like a giant exercise of power by these psychos.
[00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:51.572]  Yeah, and you know, it wasn't just in New York.
[00:41:51.672 --> 00:41:54.194]  It was the majority of Democratic-run states.
[00:41:54.693 --> 00:42:01.195]  That banned alternative treatments, that banned the hydroxychloroquine and zinc protocol, it banned... Exactly, it was all unified.
[00:42:01.215 --> 00:42:01.796]  Let's talk about it.
[00:42:01.816 --> 00:42:10.359]  It was California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, there was a few others, but yeah, they all did it in unison.
[00:42:11.479 --> 00:42:15.921]  Yeah, and the thing is, and here's another point.
[00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:20.940]  They targeted low-income minority populations.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:26.587]  They targeted the poor, the hospitals that served the poor, underprivileged areas.
[00:42:27.348 --> 00:42:35.378]  And if you look around, you will see that every single hospital that was super hard hit served minorities.
[00:42:36.431 --> 00:42:38.993]  We've got an amazing nurse whistleblower who's been totally vindicated.
[00:42:39.033 --> 00:42:39.794]  Nurse Erin's our guest.
[00:42:39.814 --> 00:42:40.194]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:03.152]  Warning!
[00:43:03.252 --> 00:43:03.773]  Warning!
[00:43:03.853 --> 00:43:04.234]  Warning!
[00:43:04.374 --> 00:43:08.481]  This is a sales pitch for Christmas and New Year's is coming up.
[00:43:09.442 --> 00:43:15.492]  Listen, my sales pitches sometimes sound really weird because truth is stranger than fiction, and I just tell you what's really going on around here.
[00:43:16.326 --> 00:43:21.788]  I already had supplement companies as one of my biggest sponsors going back 20 plus years ago.
[00:43:22.468 --> 00:43:34.111]  And about 10 years ago I thought, you know, we ought to take control of this ourselves and go out and research the highest quality supplements and then produce them and sell them ourselves so we can actually fund our operation to the next level.
[00:43:34.571 --> 00:43:37.492]  And we did that and you love the products and we've gotten
[00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:40.407]  We're the 10 manufacturers over the years.
[00:43:40.427 --> 00:43:43.150]  We've got five right now that are top-tier firms.
[00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:45.812]  Some of our products are bestsellers that are private labeled.
[00:43:46.412 --> 00:43:51.297]  Some of the other products are proprietary products that we've come up with, working with top researchers.
[00:43:51.397 --> 00:43:56.601]  But then, a lot of folks go, Jones, your stuff gets five-star reviews, but you gain weight, you lose weight.
[00:43:56.661 --> 00:43:57.782]  You gain weight, you lose weight.
[00:43:58.323 --> 00:44:02.266]  And you work a lot of hours, you don't take care of yourself, you're not the best spokesperson for your own products.
[00:44:02.586 --> 00:44:03.187]  And I know that.
[00:44:03.227 --> 00:44:04.127]  I'm totally honest about it.
[00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:06.910]  I eat too much, I drink too much, you name it.
[00:44:08.237 --> 00:44:13.782]  But one reason I tend to lose a lot of weight and then gain it back is I'll get on all of our supplements.
[00:44:15.064 --> 00:44:18.227]  And then I'll get big success when I'm actually taking a bunch of them.
[00:44:20.154 --> 00:44:23.336]  And then I will forget to take them, because I was never a supplement guy before.
[00:44:23.356 --> 00:44:24.236]  They were just my sponsors.
[00:44:24.957 --> 00:44:25.837]  And I'll gain weight back.
[00:44:25.977 --> 00:44:29.599]  So, I did this last October, November, December.
[00:44:29.619 --> 00:44:30.660]  Lost 35 pounds.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.740]  I took Living Defense.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.881]  I did X2.
[00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:36.202]  I did DNA Force Plus religiously every day.
[00:44:36.483 --> 00:44:39.004]  And I had more energy to exercise as well, and I lost 35 pounds.
[00:44:39.124 --> 00:44:41.266]  People are like, how the hell did you lose 30-something pounds in a couple months?
[00:44:41.366 --> 00:44:42.427]  And it was literally the supplements.
[00:44:42.467 --> 00:44:48.032]  So, listen to this testimonial from just one listener a year ago who called in about what Living Defense did for him.
[00:44:48.292 --> 00:44:49.353]  It's been sold out for months.
[00:44:49.493 --> 00:44:51.015]  It's back in stock right now.
[00:44:51.215 --> 00:44:52.176]  MFORESTORE.COM.

[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:01.524]  Whatever you do, make the New Year's resolution to take this amazing product, Living Defense, from MFORESTORE.COM.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.440]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:10.881]  Hey Alex!
[00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:11.962]  Oh my God!
[00:45:12.382 --> 00:45:15.044]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[00:45:15.364 --> 00:45:19.727]  Alex, I gotta tell you man, I don't care what anybody has ever said about you.
[00:45:20.267 --> 00:45:25.951]  You have re-appealed more human beings than anybody on planet Earth and God bless you.
[00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:28.833]  Everything you stand for, everything you've done.
[00:45:29.898 --> 00:45:31.160]  You are the best, man.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.961]  I mean, it's the absolute truth.
[00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:38.167]  And when I heard you today with this live call, and you encouraged people to call in, I said, that's it, man.
[00:45:38.547 --> 00:45:39.408]  I'm just going to break down.
[00:45:39.448 --> 00:45:42.772]  I got to tell you, look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[00:45:42.812 --> 00:45:46.536]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[00:45:46.996 --> 00:45:51.421]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars
[00:45:52.239 --> 00:45:58.541]  Every day for three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[00:45:58.601 --> 00:46:00.121]  Let me tell you something, man.
[00:46:00.141 --> 00:46:07.163]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[00:46:07.563 --> 00:46:09.043]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[00:46:09.323 --> 00:46:13.284]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[00:46:13.324 --> 00:46:15.905]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense.
[00:46:15.945 --> 00:46:18.946]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[00:46:19.366 --> 00:46:21.088]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[00:46:21.248 --> 00:46:21.748]  I got it.
[00:46:21.788 --> 00:46:22.949]  I hid it from the nurses.
[00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.330]  I started taking it.
[00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.752]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[00:46:26.813 --> 00:46:27.613]  It saved my life.
[00:46:28.074 --> 00:46:30.836]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[00:46:30.976 --> 00:46:41.425]  Listen, man, if there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled or anybody's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that Living Defense.
[00:46:41.605 --> 00:46:42.266]  It's true, folks.
[00:46:42.326 --> 00:46:45.308]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[00:46:45.368 --> 00:46:46.970]  And Living Defense is over-the-top good.
[00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:48.690]  We're not making this up.
[00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:52.491]  Just like our information is game-changing, the products are game-changing.
[00:46:52.511 --> 00:46:53.632]  Bad Doc Video!
[00:47:02.714 --> 00:47:08.615]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.078 --> 00:47:34.040]  All right, Nurse Erin Marie Olsinski is our guest.
[00:47:35.461 --> 00:47:36.782]  And man, I'm talking to her during the break.
[00:47:36.862 --> 00:47:38.123]  I'm like, what's the next fight?
[00:47:38.223 --> 00:47:38.924]  What do we need to do?
[00:47:38.964 --> 00:47:44.188]  And she's like, I'm launching a huge nurses conference in Florida on January 9th, I think she said.
[00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:45.509]  And I've got a book out.
[00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:47.150]  I mean, she is kicking ass.
[00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:49.512]  A great American patriot, a veteran.
[00:47:50.882 --> 00:47:51.703]  This is what we need.
[00:47:51.983 --> 00:47:56.690]  So many doctors, so many epidemiologists, so many scientists have spoken out, shown the facts.
[00:47:56.730 --> 00:48:00.775]  The former chief science officer at Merck's come out saying it's all a big hoax, fraud.
[00:48:00.795 --> 00:48:03.378]  It's crazy that...
[00:48:04.042 --> 00:48:08.186]  Like, there's almost no one on their side but the American Bar Association.
[00:48:08.206 --> 00:48:11.189]  The lawyers say that we should stay locked down.
[00:48:11.249 --> 00:48:13.791]  The lawyers say we should all take forced inoculations.
[00:48:14.192 --> 00:48:15.193]  It's a huge power grab.
[00:48:15.213 --> 00:48:21.699]  So in the 10 minutes we have left, tell folks about solutions, ideas, and then other areas we haven't hit on.
[00:48:23.683 --> 00:48:28.887]  Well, as you pointed out, I'm going to have, it's the Global Frontline Nurses Summit.
[00:48:29.027 --> 00:48:36.673]  It's going to be in the Tampa Bay area on January 9th of 2021.
[00:48:36.733 --> 00:48:38.034]  Hopefully it will be a better year.
[00:48:38.775 --> 00:48:42.558]  But there's nurses that are coming from all over the world.
[00:48:43.239 --> 00:48:47.502]  And these nurses are all seen, we're all on the same page.
[00:48:47.878 --> 00:48:49.138]  We all see the same thing.
[00:48:49.398 --> 00:48:52.779]  We all know that it has been a mass genocide of patients.
[00:48:52.979 --> 00:48:54.020]  And we're going to talk about it.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:04.562]  And if nurses are the most trusted profession in the United States, and I think around the world, then I hope that people will be open to hearing from us.
[00:49:04.782 --> 00:49:08.563]  Because honestly, at the end of the day, we have everything to lose.
[00:49:08.743 --> 00:49:09.524]  Some of us have.
[00:49:09.704 --> 00:49:10.164]  I have.
[00:49:10.744 --> 00:49:11.244]  Everything.
[00:49:12.264 --> 00:49:13.205]  But nothing to gain.
[00:49:13.425 --> 00:49:14.205]  You know, except
[00:49:14.673 --> 00:49:22.098]  To stand on the right side of history and to make sure that history never repeats itself and to stop the corruption before it gets any worse.
[00:49:22.338 --> 00:49:33.506]  And, you know, once they take away our freedoms that are God-given right, you know, as human beings, it is going to be next to impossible to ever get them back.
[00:49:33.987 --> 00:49:34.907]  So, you know, that's why I am
[00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.811]  Fighting with every inch of my being.
[00:49:38.831 --> 00:49:39.872]  It's in my blood.
[00:49:40.052 --> 00:49:41.152]  I served our country.
[00:49:41.853 --> 00:49:43.454]  I love our country.
[00:49:43.734 --> 00:49:47.016]  And, you know, there's really nothing that is going to get in my way.
[00:49:47.276 --> 00:49:52.118]  And even though there's been a whole lot of people that, you know, try to stop me from doing it, so.
[00:49:52.138 --> 00:49:52.899]  Well, let me guess.
[00:49:52.959 --> 00:49:53.879]  You blew the whistle.
[00:49:53.939 --> 00:49:55.660]  They hadn't fired you and censored you.
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:56.681]  You'd done your duty.
[00:49:56.701 --> 00:49:57.301]  You'd exposed it.
[00:49:57.321 --> 00:49:58.122]  You still speak out.
[00:49:58.142 --> 00:50:04.185]  But them trying to suppress you, is that really giving you a second wind or really supercharge and now really fight back?
[00:50:05.839 --> 00:50:09.440]  I mean, all the information they censor is exactly what the people need to know.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:13.281]  So if anything, you know, even bad news is good news.
[00:50:13.401 --> 00:50:23.223]  So listen to what they're trying to, you know, censor from people that have no reason to lie.
[00:50:24.103 --> 00:50:31.985]  And, you know, yeah, yes, it does give me more motivation and it does light a fire that I'm not willing to put out.
[00:50:32.245 --> 00:50:32.385]  So.
[00:50:34.116 --> 00:50:37.298]  Where do you predict this goes if they're able to weasel Biden in there?
[00:50:37.338 --> 00:50:39.179]  He says he's going to intensify it all.
[00:50:39.199 --> 00:50:41.100]  It makes him so unpopular.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.060]  It creates depression.
[00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:45.002]  Why do you think they just are so obsessed with this?
[00:50:46.903 --> 00:50:47.423]  Control.
[00:50:48.083 --> 00:50:50.325]  You know, I mean, Biden doesn't even know what he's doing.
[00:50:50.485 --> 00:50:58.609]  You know, he's just one of the, you know, he he's a pawn in a much bigger, sinister plan.
[00:50:59.726 --> 00:51:11.890]  And that is why we need to fight, you know, and ultimately, if Biden does get into office, which he won't, you know, we're going to see a country that we don't recognize.
[00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:14.651]  We're going to be masked up.
[00:51:15.091 --> 00:51:17.012]  We're going to be mass vaccinated.
[00:51:17.132 --> 00:51:21.894]  We're going to have absolutely no control over our bodies or the bodies of our children.
[00:51:22.494 --> 00:51:24.955]  We're going to, you know, essentially be living in
[00:51:27.066 --> 00:51:30.430]  A communist country that would be absolutely terrifying.
[00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:38.781]  A communist country that uses medical tyranny as its excuse and cover for enforcement of surveillance and political oppression.
[00:51:39.542 --> 00:51:40.663]  Getting into vaccines.
[00:51:40.863 --> 00:51:41.804]  I know you're a nurse.
[00:51:41.844 --> 00:51:42.505]  You've looked at that.
[00:51:43.286 --> 00:51:46.667]  These aren't even classic vaccines, these mRNA systems.
[00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:47.407]  I know you know that.
[00:51:48.288 --> 00:51:51.629]  And now the fact that they were trying to give it to kids in England that made them sick.
[00:51:51.649 --> 00:51:53.770]  So now they say, don't give it to under 16.
[00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.150]  Don't give it to people that have autoimmune problems.
[00:51:56.490 --> 00:52:01.152]  They suspended the vaccine in Australia because it was doing false positive HIV.
[00:52:01.832 --> 00:52:06.814]  What is your thought and your other medical colleagues thought on this real push for forced inoculation?
[00:52:09.848 --> 00:52:12.949]  I've been awake to the vaccine racket for a really long time.
[00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:17.871]  Actually, my son at 12 months, I have three boys, my middle son at 12 months was severely injured.
[00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:26.074]  And that's when I kind of dive deep into the fact that vaccines in general are liability free.
[00:52:26.194 --> 00:52:27.714]  So you can't sue the manufacturer.
[00:52:27.734 --> 00:52:31.196]  And you know, it kind of goes hand in hand with what happened to the hospitals.
[00:52:31.316 --> 00:52:34.897]  The hospitals during this whole entire COVID pandemic were also liability free.
[00:52:35.257 --> 00:52:37.658]  Nothing good comes from a liability free
[00:52:38.465 --> 00:52:38.986]  Anything.
[00:52:39.206 --> 00:52:41.748]  No entity, no corporation, nothing.
[00:52:42.388 --> 00:52:45.871]  And so, you know, in general, the toxins are bad.
[00:52:46.792 --> 00:52:52.977]  But this COVID vaccine is worse because it is an mRNA vaccine.
[00:52:53.057 --> 00:52:56.420]  It is going to permanently change people's DNA.
[00:52:57.921 --> 00:52:58.421]  Permanently.
[00:52:58.802 --> 00:53:01.884]  This is something that you can't just detox from.
[00:53:02.224 --> 00:53:03.606]  This is going to be permanent.
[00:53:03.686 --> 00:53:05.207]  I ultimately believe
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.981]  That this is going to cause a mass genocide in our population.
[00:53:10.121 --> 00:53:13.242]  It's going to be a very, very bad thing.
[00:53:13.302 --> 00:53:19.683]  And I really, really hope that people open their eyes and honestly, like, really look into this research.
[00:53:19.743 --> 00:53:25.644]  There's absolutely no reason we need a vaccine for a virus with a 99.9% survival rate.
[00:53:25.704 --> 00:53:31.105]  There is nothing else other than the fact that they want population control.
[00:53:31.605 --> 00:53:34.226]  They want to control, you know, the narrative.
[00:53:35.676 --> 00:53:36.417]  It's very dangerous.
[00:53:53.936 --> 00:54:01.322]  Hearing you now in long form is so powerful to, just as a nurse, as a mother, as a veteran, as a human.
[00:54:01.362 --> 00:54:02.142]  It's so strong.
[00:54:02.182 --> 00:54:02.703]  It's beautiful.
[00:54:03.343 --> 00:54:06.085]  And obviously you're a beautiful person physically and beautiful spiritually.
[00:54:06.105 --> 00:54:11.489]  And I know there's so many other great nurses, male and female, that I'm sure you were saying you know that are also upset.
[00:54:11.889 --> 00:54:12.770]  And I saw the U.N.
[00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:13.431]  last December.
[00:54:14.443 --> 00:54:18.585]  Say, at their own UN conference, their own head of vaccines said, we're hurting people.
[00:54:18.665 --> 00:54:19.406]  We don't like this.
[00:54:19.486 --> 00:54:20.246]  We want tests.
[00:54:20.647 --> 00:54:21.567]  We want clear stuff.
[00:54:21.587 --> 00:54:23.388]  But we're told by Big Pharma what to do.
[00:54:23.888 --> 00:54:25.749]  Our own front line wants to stop vaccines.
[00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:28.451]  Even the head UN people are saying this is wrong.
[00:54:28.971 --> 00:54:35.115]  So it shows the compartmentalization that you're against it, the doctors are against it, the UN scientists are against it.
[00:54:35.515 --> 00:54:35.996]  The U.N.
[00:54:36.016 --> 00:54:38.057]  head envoy on COVID says don't do lockdowns.
[00:54:38.238 --> 00:54:39.038]  They're still doing them.
[00:54:39.439 --> 00:54:40.820]  So it's like, who's in control?
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:41.701]  Well, it's Bill Gates.
[00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:52.091]  What do you have to say about Bill Gates, who really is, suddenly we wake up and he's going to rape us with his vaccines, he's going to keep us locked down, he's going to be the head of the G8.
[00:54:52.451 --> 00:54:55.654]  Boris Johnson says he's going to let him give him orders the next year.
[00:54:55.714 --> 00:54:59.598]  I mean, this is like, this is even crazier than Alex Jones would come up with, is what I'm saying.
[00:55:01.263 --> 00:55:07.006]  I honestly feel like it's a twilight zone because we know Bill Gates is neither a doctor or a scientist.
[00:55:07.766 --> 00:55:18.552]  And, you know, obviously we do know that he has a lot of money and we do know that everything is surrounded around money.
[00:55:19.292 --> 00:55:20.533]  Money, power, greed.
[00:55:20.973 --> 00:55:24.275]  And they don't care about the average American.
[00:55:26.216 --> 00:55:28.057]  Actually, they don't really care about anyone.
[00:55:28.747 --> 00:55:32.793]  And they care about more money and more power and more greed.
[00:55:33.294 --> 00:55:37.560]  And they will do it at the expense of human life and they will not feel bad about it.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.843]  And here's the secret.
[00:55:41.428 --> 00:55:43.649]  Like any secret testing or any big crime.
[00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:52.115]  When they get us to sign on to it, they get power over the crisis they create, and it becomes what I call too evil to fail in this dystopic system they're setting up.
[00:55:52.475 --> 00:55:53.436]  They are dystopics.
[00:55:53.576 --> 00:56:08.706]  They are creating a dystopia that they manage and control, and they need us to go into mass Stockholm Syndrome, so he is evoking a psychological response from us of submitting to something insane, so we'll submit to stuff even more insane later.
[00:56:08.966 --> 00:56:11.208]  We're being inducted into slavery right now.
[00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:22.114]  Well, they're creating the problem and then they're going to come around and act like they're, you know, we should thank them for finding a, quote, solution.
[00:56:22.554 --> 00:56:29.598]  You know, it is definitely quite a quite an intense, well thought out PSYOP.
[00:56:29.778 --> 00:56:33.661]  And sadly, it's working on quite a bit of our population.
[00:56:33.881 --> 00:56:38.383]  But eventually, hopefully there's going to be
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:49.587]  A lot more people standing up and saying no and trying, you know, hopefully holding a lot of these people accountable and putting a lot of them in prison because that's where they ultimately belong.
[00:56:49.707 --> 00:56:51.489]  Nurse Holshest, you're 100% right.
[00:56:51.529 --> 00:56:59.635]  We need to not just debate the merits, we need to say you're going to prison, you violated the Nuremberg Code, you violated the Geneva Convention, you make money off this.
[00:56:59.955 --> 00:57:00.635]  You're a criminal.
[00:57:00.675 --> 00:57:01.655]  We hold you responsible.
[00:57:01.915 --> 00:57:04.016]  We don't care if you have the 1986 Vaccine Act.
[00:57:04.396 --> 00:57:05.836]  You are held accountable.
[00:57:06.096 --> 00:57:07.397]  You bit off more than you can chew.
[00:57:07.677 --> 00:57:12.738]  You knew your vaccine fraud was failing at the U.N., so you doubled down with all of this, and you're not going to succeed.
[00:57:13.158 --> 00:57:16.639]  All right, Nurse Erin, thank you so much.
[00:57:16.679 --> 00:57:19.440]  We really appreciate you, and please come on The War Room.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.020]  I know you're already on with David Knight before us.
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.261]  Great job with David Knight and his folks getting you on.
[00:57:24.621 --> 00:57:25.281]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:25.301 --> 00:57:26.081]  It's been an amazing hour.
[00:57:27.081 --> 00:57:28.522]  Yeah, thank you so much for having me.
[00:57:28.582 --> 00:57:29.202]  I hope to be back.
[00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:31.432]  We'd love to have you back in studio.
[00:57:31.732 --> 00:57:32.553]  Bring some doctors with you.
[00:57:32.574 --> 00:57:33.254]  We'll get everybody in here.
[00:57:33.555 --> 00:57:33.815]  All right.
[00:57:34.476 --> 00:57:34.696]  All right.
[00:57:34.776 --> 00:57:37.259]  Paul Joseph Watson from the UK takes over.
[00:57:37.299 --> 00:57:39.422]  I've got five more minutes, though, before he comes on.
[00:57:39.462 --> 00:57:41.064]  And then the war room with Owen Schroer.
[00:57:41.525 --> 00:57:43.547]  Man, there's a lot of great souls out there.
[00:57:43.587 --> 00:57:44.148]  And she's one of them.
[00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:45.490]  That was powerful.
[00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:46.331]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:46.351 --> 00:57:46.851]  Stay with us.
[00:57:50.506 --> 00:57:53.087]  Just another Brandon here for Just Another Channel.
[00:57:53.408 --> 00:57:54.648]  We're in Washington, D.C.
[00:57:54.688 --> 00:57:55.909]  here stopping the steel.
[00:57:56.329 --> 00:58:00.711]  Folks, it was a 23-hour drive from Texas to D.C.
[00:58:00.771 --> 00:58:07.295]  nonstop, and I've got to give it up to TurboForce from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:07.475 --> 00:58:08.676]  I'd like to thank Alex Jones.
[00:58:08.696 --> 00:58:12.398]  I'd like to thank InfoWars.com for TurboForce.
[00:58:13.058 --> 00:58:18.986]  Because if it weren't for TurboForce, we would have had to stop, get some rest, and probably get here the next day.
[00:58:19.347 --> 00:58:26.117]  And who wants to get here the next day when you can just drink TurboForce from InfoWarsStore.com and get here on time.
[00:58:26.317 --> 00:58:28.941]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and get yours today.
[00:58:33.372 --> 00:58:34.693]  Oh, what's up?
[00:58:34.913 --> 00:58:35.033]  Oh!
[00:58:35.333 --> 00:58:40.917]  Of that Turbo Force, Greg Reese, Rob Motherf***ing Dew, representing Alex Jones.
[00:58:41.097 --> 00:58:42.878]  Bro, I got the f***ing documents, Alex.
[00:58:43.158 --> 00:58:44.799]  I got the documents, Alex Jones.
[00:58:45.099 --> 00:58:47.421]  We love you in LA, California, baby.
[00:58:47.501 --> 00:58:48.281]  I'm on it.
[00:58:48.361 --> 00:58:49.742]  I've been juiced up.
[00:58:49.862 --> 00:58:50.523]  Fighting that T5.
[00:58:50.583 --> 00:58:53.204]  Got my crown, because I'm a Kangaroo around here.
[00:58:53.244 --> 00:58:54.805]  Shout out to my proud boys.
[00:58:55.006 --> 00:58:55.806]  That's what's up.
[00:58:56.126 --> 00:58:56.246]  Woo!
[00:58:56.306 --> 00:58:58.948]  Alex Jones in for one!
[00:58:59.048 --> 00:58:59.508]  Yeah!
[00:59:02.851 --> 00:59:06.814]  America is awake, and America has only begun to fight!
[00:59:08.015 --> 00:59:13.779]  And we have just begun the occupation of D.C.
[00:59:13.799 --> 00:59:19.704]  The Tricombs and the Globalists think they're taking America over?
[00:59:19.744 --> 00:59:23.106]  They just woke up the sleeping giant!
[00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:32.271]  That's it!
[00:59:32.451 --> 00:59:34.452]  I keep fighting the Infowars, baby!
[00:59:34.592 --> 00:59:35.592]  Proud boy!
[00:59:35.832 --> 00:59:37.193]  Proud of your boy Alex Jones!
[00:59:37.433 --> 00:59:37.773]  Salute him!
[00:59:37.813 --> 00:59:39.154]  Thank you for everything you do!
[00:59:39.194 --> 00:59:40.354]  God bless you!
[00:59:40.394 --> 00:59:41.875]  And all the Infowars family!
[00:59:41.975 --> 00:59:46.277]  God bless all of you!
[00:59:47.157 --> 00:59:49.338]  Merry Christmas!
[01:00:09.494 --> 01:00:12.856]  Acting Pentagon Chief halts Biden transition briefings.
[01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:21.601]  So he's halting those briefings, meaning Trump's getting ready to go to the Resolute Desk and announce that he's a CHICOM agent.
[01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:22.562]  Here's the evidence.
[01:00:22.642 --> 01:00:23.842]  America, you can't allow this.
[01:00:24.183 --> 01:00:25.704]  Ten million people need to march on D.C.
[01:00:25.764 --> 01:00:26.144]  right now.
[01:00:26.484 --> 01:00:30.646]  And if I'm sitting there on Christmas Eve and Trump says that, I'm on an airplane, I'm in a car.
[01:00:31.707 --> 01:00:32.888]  I'm walking and I have to.
[01:00:32.948 --> 01:00:33.649]  I'm taking action.
[01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:36.411]  The enemy has been forced out in the open.
[01:00:37.052 --> 01:00:38.934]  World government is here.
[01:00:39.574 --> 01:00:47.401]  And the system is publicly stealing this election from the biggest landslide and the biggest political realignment since 1776!
[01:00:51.496 --> 01:01:02.979]  He could order the, within the swing states, if he wanted to, he could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an election in each of those states.
[01:01:03.019 --> 01:01:04.200]  I mean, it's not unprecedented.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:08.821]  I mean, these people out there talking about martial law, it's like it's something that we've never done.
[01:01:08.841 --> 01:01:10.922]  We've done, martial law has been instituted 64 times.
[01:01:12.743 --> 01:01:13.984]  64 times, Greg.
[01:01:14.385 --> 01:01:15.806]  So I'm not calling for that.
[01:01:16.327 --> 01:01:18.129]  We have a constitutional process.
[01:01:18.269 --> 01:01:20.091]  We clearly have a constitutional process.
[01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:23.194]  I think you highlighted some of that in your previous segment.
[01:01:23.595 --> 01:01:24.856]  That has to be followed.
[01:01:25.677 --> 01:01:26.438]  That's what I keep saying.
[01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:28.160]  Trump has to call it out like it is.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.682]  Call for us to peacefully take action.
[01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:46.077]  There is disagreement between the Biden team and the Trump administration over access to the Pentagon.
[01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:54.322]  Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller says that his team and the Biden team had mutually agreed to put off some meetings scheduled for Friday until after the holidays.
[01:01:54.702 --> 01:02:06.528]  But the head of the Biden transition told reporters that's not true and that his team continues to face quote isolated resistance from political appointees in the Defense Department and similar issues at a few other agencies he declined to name.
[01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:14.592]  People who want to make hay in Washington are going to try to use your adult son as a cudgel against you.
[01:02:15.992 --> 01:02:19.114]  How do you feel about that and what do you have to say to those people?
[01:02:19.334 --> 01:02:20.855]  We have great confidence in our son.
[01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:26.241]  I'm not concerned about any accusations made against him.
[01:02:27.022 --> 01:02:28.324]  It's used to get to me.
[01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.926]  I think it's kind of foul play.
[01:02:31.066 --> 01:02:32.748]  But look, it is what it is.
[01:02:33.008 --> 01:02:34.790]  And he's a grown man.
[01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:36.993]  He is the smartest man I know.
[01:02:37.013 --> 01:02:39.896]  I mean, in pure intellectual capacity.
[01:02:40.696 --> 01:03:10.296]  Hunter Biden's quite explicit in one particular communication with his daughter He's basically complaining that he pays half of the entire family's bills And he includes his mother and father in that and makes reference to pops So the point is is that all this enrichment that has been taking place is also flowing to Joe Biden Indirectly through his son, but the fact of the matter is he's still a beneficiary a direct beneficiary of these foreign deals
[01:03:10.937 --> 01:03:21.809]  The email is saying, look, I need a set of keys for Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Jim Biden, my uncle, and the chairman of CEFC, Gong Wen Dong.
[01:03:21.929 --> 01:03:24.752]  So all of these people are sharing an office together?
[01:03:25.032 --> 01:03:25.913]  Let's keep in mind
[01:03:25.933 --> 01:03:27.353]  We're good to go.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:59.085]  And this is the same entity upon which Joe Biden, you know, the so-called big guy, was going to get 10%.
[01:03:59.165 --> 01:04:02.207]  They were literally going to share office space.
[01:04:02.247 --> 01:04:09.313]  They were going to house the Biden Foundation and a CEFC office in the exact same office space.
[01:04:09.373 --> 01:04:15.738]  So it's very troubling and it speaks to the fact of how cozy the Bidens have been with the Chinese.
[01:04:16.078 --> 01:04:24.023]  Let's hear what CBS News had to hear about the documented, not like the Russian stuff, the documented foreign interference for Joe Biden.
[01:04:25.384 --> 01:04:29.006]  What did Ratcliffe say about election fraud and interference?
[01:04:29.901 --> 01:04:39.871]  Well, DNI Ratcliffe leads the 17 intelligence agencies, and he has access to the most highly classified information that is held by the U.S.
[01:04:39.911 --> 01:04:40.311]  government.
[01:04:40.371 --> 01:04:53.324]  And he told CBS News that there was foreign election interference by China, Iran, and Russia in November of this year, and he is anticipating a public report on those findings in January.
[01:04:53.444 --> 01:04:54.985]  And so, do we respond to their takeover?
[01:04:55.005 --> 01:04:56.326]  They've already put us under lockdown.
[01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:57.727]  They've already put us under martial law.
[01:04:57.747 --> 01:05:00.289]  They're already telling us, putting up medical IDs to leave our houses.
[01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:05.353]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[01:05:05.633 --> 01:05:15.978]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[01:05:16.238 --> 01:05:22.321]  Introducing Rocket Rest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:06:21.217 --> 01:06:24.200]  Good enough for me and my Bobby.
[01:06:29.938 --> 01:06:32.959]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got Joe Hoff coming on in a few minutes.
[01:06:33.059 --> 01:06:51.182]  He's a great corporate fraud investigator, does a great job with his brother that owns and runs Gateway Pundit, with huge developments of judges in Michigan allowing certified forensic reports, findings, absolutely total fraud by Dominion, saying Dominion's main goal is organized election theft.
[01:06:51.222 --> 01:06:51.962]  That's their finding.
[01:06:52.322 --> 01:06:55.003]  Super strong, major prestigious organization.
[01:06:55.683 --> 01:06:57.685]  That's coming up as soon as we get Hoft on.
[01:06:58.005 --> 01:07:03.170]  But I tell you, John Bowne did a very important report that really tells it all.
[01:07:03.611 --> 01:07:17.644]  But I hope everybody will share and get out because this big breaking news of Communist China and Biden and the criminal investigations and these leaks out of the CCP, Communist Party China, Communist Party China, CPC.
[01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:23.667]  This is so massive and shows Trump is fighting back with 37 days to inauguration.
[01:07:23.987 --> 01:07:31.590]  And so as bad as it looks with the media saying Biden's the president, and as bad as it looks with all the hoaxes, remember they're paper tiger, they're paper dragon.
[01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:33.611]  Joe Biden has holes in him.
[01:07:34.011 --> 01:07:35.712]  More holes in him than a Swiss cheese.
[01:07:36.032 --> 01:07:37.552]  And this boat is not going to float.
[01:07:37.872 --> 01:07:40.653]  So just continue to move forward and fighting hard.
[01:07:40.833 --> 01:07:42.934]  One way or another, we're never accepting this monster.
[01:07:43.374 --> 01:07:49.817]  Joe Biden will be removed either by impeachment or he'll be removed by losing this election, exposing me of fraud.
[01:07:50.197 --> 01:07:52.998]  And we will politically destroy his ideas.
[01:07:53.598 --> 01:08:01.021]  We don't want a single hair on his head harmed, but we want his horrible, evil, globalist ideas of the Communist Party China killed.
[01:08:01.701 --> 01:08:02.261]  Not him.
[01:08:02.541 --> 01:08:03.701]  The idea's killed.
[01:08:04.021 --> 01:08:06.302]  The idea's refuted and destroyed.
[01:08:06.962 --> 01:08:08.122]  Joe Biden's an empty husk.
[01:08:08.362 --> 01:08:12.203]  Don't turn him into a victim, into any of that.
[01:08:13.003 --> 01:08:15.303]  So, here's the report and we'll be right back with Mr. Hoft.
[01:08:15.323 --> 01:08:23.045]  So far, the evidence is uncontradicted that the President used taxpayer dollars to ask the Ukrainians to help him cheat an election.
[01:08:23.225 --> 01:08:26.845]  Eric Swalwell is having a sweaty and flatulent Christmas.
[01:08:27.085 --> 01:08:30.226]  And it's blowing up right in the Democrats' Grinch face.
[01:08:30.572 --> 01:08:32.645]  Well, I don't have any concern about Mr. Swalwell.
[01:08:33.627 --> 01:08:41.650]  Oh, there are those in the Congress who believe, and I am among them, that we should be seeing what influence the Chinese.
[01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:44.191]  I've been fighting them, as you know, for over 30 years.
[01:08:44.851 --> 01:08:53.414]  I do think that it's unfortunate that Mr. McCarthy is trying to make an issue of this when his leader, we all found out at the same time.
[01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:54.955]  But you know what he's trying to do?
[01:08:54.995 --> 01:08:59.637]  He's trying to deflect attention from the fact that he has QAnon in his
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.542]  His delegation over there.
[01:09:03.562 --> 01:09:19.544]  And that, I think, is a danger in terms of our debate here about what the possibilities are for undue influence to members of Congress.
[01:09:19.974 --> 01:09:24.596]  You know, we have people like Swalwell over there that has got this massive problem.
[01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:35.221]  While the counterintelligence structure and system and leadership was focused on Mike Flynn and President Donald J. Trump, the counterintelligence effort, they should have been focused on Swalwell.
[01:09:35.422 --> 01:09:44.806]  And that threat against, that we have now learned about Swalwell, and frankly, Hunter Biden and the entire Biden Foundation and family, this is dangerous stuff.
[01:09:44.886 --> 01:09:46.427]  We are playing with fire right now.
[01:09:46.967 --> 01:09:54.933]  I am concerned that we don't know what we need to know about Donald Trump to protect the country from what Russia has on him.
[01:09:55.094 --> 01:10:00.178]  We have deep suspicions and all of the arrows continue to point in the same direction.
[01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:08.424]  Eric Swalwell, who wasn't ready for prime time, is a Chinese tool going back to his days on the city council in California.
[01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:21.831]  He's been towing the Communist Party line ever since a Chinese spy assisted his defeat of a 40-year incumbent, catapulting the Manchurian candidate into Congress eight years ago, as Axios had revealed.
[01:10:22.111 --> 01:10:26.694]  This story comes from Axios in Washington, which is no one's idea of a right-wing news outlet.
[01:10:27.294 --> 01:10:34.518]  But to their great credit, a pair of Axios reporters doggedly spent the last year investigating what turned out to be an amazing story.
[01:10:35.552 --> 01:10:44.497]  A Chinese intelligence agent called Feng Feng, or as she renamed herself when she came to this country, Christine Feng, became a force within the Democratic Party of California.
[01:10:45.338 --> 01:10:48.600]  Along the way, she cultivated a number of Democratic office holders.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:55.023]  Feng had sexual relationships with at least two of them, identified in the Axios story as mayors from Midwestern cities.
[01:10:55.924 --> 01:10:59.586]  Feng also began a relationship with a man called Eric Swalwell.
[01:11:00.336 --> 01:11:01.737]  You may recognize that name.
[01:11:02.177 --> 01:11:04.599]  Eric Swalwell is a member of the United States Congress.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.402]  Swalwell sits on the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:11:07.802 --> 01:11:10.284]  He is privy to this country's most closely held secrets.
[01:11:10.384 --> 01:11:22.133]  The Chinese government had been infiltrating Wall Street corporations and Congress before Swalwell was even an unpaid intern for California's 10th Congressional District.
[01:11:22.273 --> 01:11:25.234]  Swalwell is merely the tip of the iceberg, though.
[01:11:25.354 --> 01:11:30.536]  The attack on the common-sense nationalist slogan, America First, is a massive tell.
[01:11:30.796 --> 01:11:41.819]  The elites know that they must betray the country and protect their communist counterparts, eating away our liberties like a cancer, pushing propaganda like never before.
[01:11:42.179 --> 01:11:52.747]  As the Washington Examiner reported, while the Swalwell news broke, MSNBC spent roughly five minutes on Axios' reporting during the network's 5 a.m.
[01:11:52.787 --> 01:11:56.049]  program without mentioning it again for the rest of the day.
[01:11:56.229 --> 01:12:01.413]  Meanwhile, CNN completely avoided the story altogether, both on-air and online.
[01:12:01.633 --> 01:12:07.417]  Fox News also noted that major newspapers, such as the New York Times and the Washington Post,
[01:12:07.777 --> 01:12:17.303]  Both of which dedicated tons of coverage to allegations against President Trump concerning Russia, had not yet afforded any coverage to the Swalwell story.
[01:12:17.483 --> 01:12:25.648]  Broadcast networks ABC, NBC and CBS also skipped coverage of the controversy during morning and evening shows.
[01:12:25.868 --> 01:12:31.069]  There has now been a major leak of official records from the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:12:31.569 --> 01:12:34.590]  It is believed to be the first leak of its kind in the world.
[01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:40.351]  A register with the details of nearly 2 million Communist Party members.
[01:12:40.871 --> 01:12:49.333]  As the Communist Chinese leak... Alright, we have Joe Hoffs, who's a major fraud investigator, major auditor for Fortune 500 companies.
[01:12:49.353 --> 01:12:55.114]  You know his amazing brother, Jim Hoffs at Gateway Pundit, that heads above the rest, has been the number one site
[01:12:55.934 --> 01:13:09.056]  Just in a Herculean effort, cleaning out the Aegean stables, exposing and breaking hundreds of articles that have been absolutely on target and trailblazing in the last
[01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:12.686]  Month or so since the fraudulent election.
[01:13:13.406 --> 01:13:18.209]  And so I want to give him the floor of the next three segments, the next 45 minutes, but I got him on late and I appreciate him being here.
[01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:20.770]  I just want to ask him with two minutes to break.
[01:13:21.351 --> 01:13:22.631]  You've been big on China.
[01:13:22.671 --> 01:13:23.972]  You've lived in Asia.
[01:13:24.853 --> 01:13:28.895]  You've been exposing the COVID exaggeration and hoax as well.
[01:13:29.275 --> 01:13:30.295]  Spend a few minutes on that.
[01:13:30.315 --> 01:13:36.759]  Then we're going to come back and get into the election and the giant breaking news that's unfolding there.
[01:13:37.159 --> 01:13:38.460]  But just please give us your overall
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:46.303]  Alex, I think you're right on it.
[01:13:46.383 --> 01:13:47.604]  I think you're right on target.
[01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:48.464]  You're over target.
[01:13:48.784 --> 01:13:49.244]  Absolutely.
[01:13:49.264 --> 01:13:50.405]  And it's great to be here again.
[01:13:50.465 --> 01:13:54.366]  Yes, I think there are some real concerns with China right now.
[01:13:55.127 --> 01:14:06.011]  There's a number of things that just occurred over the last 24 hours as you as you know, this release of these more than what 2 million individuals that are members of the Communist Party that's
[01:14:06.914 --> 01:14:09.036]  A list of worldwide individuals.
[01:14:09.076 --> 01:14:12.399]  My understanding is there's at least 50,000 Americans on that list.
[01:14:12.779 --> 01:14:15.682]  It's probably no surprise that we can't wait to see who those people are.
[01:14:16.342 --> 01:14:22.948]  The names are in Chinese, so they need to be translated, but just based on phone number, we can tell there's around 50,000.
[01:14:23.008 --> 01:14:24.569]  So that was big.
[01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:34.558]  We have some other, there was the hack last night on one of the government entities, the financial entity, and then news this morning also about
[01:14:35.519 --> 01:14:36.040]  I don't
[01:14:54.171 --> 01:14:58.234]  Um, was something that was big, but we also saw that they were lying about it immediately.
[01:14:58.254 --> 01:15:01.376]  The WHO was as you, as you would call Alex, we're on your show.
[01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:11.124]  We talked about this, how the WHO was saying this thing was going to be worse than really, it sounded like the Spanish flu with a 3% mortality rate worldwide.
[01:15:11.144 --> 01:15:12.445]  And that scared the whole world.
[01:15:12.525 --> 01:15:14.866]  And we noticed not their numbers weren't right.
[01:15:15.287 --> 01:15:16.147]  They were inaccurate.
[01:15:16.167 --> 01:15:21.751]  Now we're seeing that come to fruition as, uh, as Democrats continue to want to close down cities.
[01:15:21.872 --> 01:15:22.292]  But, um,
[01:15:23.015 --> 01:15:24.356]  But the numbers just aren't there.
[01:15:24.396 --> 01:15:25.517]  They just don't make sense.
[01:15:25.537 --> 01:15:26.537]  So we were right then.
[01:15:27.198 --> 01:15:28.579]  And there's a lot going on.
[01:15:28.919 --> 01:15:31.141]  And so certainly a lot for us to chat about.
[01:15:31.161 --> 01:15:34.363]  Well, Joe, I know, because I'm up 18 hours a day.
[01:15:34.383 --> 01:15:35.403]  I know you guys.
[01:15:35.844 --> 01:15:36.784]  I'm not about kissing your ass.
[01:15:36.804 --> 01:15:37.085]  It's true.
[01:15:37.105 --> 01:15:38.906]  You guys are doing more work than everybody else combined.
[01:15:38.926 --> 01:15:39.686]  I know how you're doing it.
[01:15:39.987 --> 01:15:42.909]  And the lawsuits, the groups you're funding, and what you're doing, you're the tip of the spirit, buddy.
[01:15:43.389 --> 01:15:45.991]  And so it's good to see somebody out there more the tip of the spirit than we are.
[01:15:46.411 --> 01:15:47.292]  We're good live on air.
[01:15:47.312 --> 01:15:48.052]  I have a lot of great guests.
[01:15:48.072 --> 01:15:50.074]  But that's why you're here, so people use
[01:15:51.094 --> 01:15:52.975]  How you doing Alex?
[01:15:53.055 --> 01:15:53.696]  I love you man.
[01:15:53.756 --> 01:15:54.857]  I want to make a quick plug.
[01:15:54.877 --> 01:15:55.657]  That DNA Force.
[01:15:55.677 --> 01:15:56.137]  I love it.
[01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:57.418]  I've been using it quite a while.
[01:15:57.438 --> 01:15:59.360]  And I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day.
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.501]  And I see that it contains quercetin.
[01:16:20.979 --> 01:16:32.765]  Which, according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine, and it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[01:16:32.865 --> 01:16:34.886]  So, people might want to take a look at that.
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:54.142]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctors sell for like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it was really only cost something like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this.
[01:16:54.162 --> 01:16:55.624]  So thanks, thanks for the plug.
[01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:11.871]  The globalists want you sick.
[01:17:12.671 --> 01:17:14.152]  They want you emasculated.
[01:17:14.252 --> 01:17:15.453]  They want you dehumanized.
[01:17:15.753 --> 01:17:16.854]  They want you dumbed down.
[01:17:17.374 --> 01:17:20.536]  They want you to be a weak, pathetic slave.
[01:17:21.196 --> 01:17:28.180]  And they start that control system by dumbing you down for birth and never letting you know the truth of what is unfolding.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:29.981]  It is simply disgusting.
[01:17:30.661 --> 01:17:33.702]  Ever hear the establishment telling you that vitamin D3 is vital?
[01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:42.325]  You ever hear them explain to you that 40 plus percent of the public is vitamin D3 deficient and so many diseases and chronic problems are caused by it?
[01:17:42.345 --> 01:17:42.385]  No!
[01:17:42.485 --> 01:17:48.527]  Even though it's known scientific fact like gravity or the temperature at which water boils.
[01:17:48.848 --> 01:17:49.428]  These are facts.
[01:17:49.788 --> 01:17:50.328]  Well guess what?
[01:17:50.408 --> 01:17:52.929]  Winter Sun, after being sold out for months, is now back in stock.
[01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:56.890]  I didn't just get into the vitamin D3 game when it became so huge last year.
[01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:59.571]  We've been promoting it for more than 15 years with sponsors.
[01:17:59.711 --> 01:18:02.272]  Then about eight years ago, I started InfoWorks Life.
[01:18:02.392 --> 01:18:10.295]  I approached one of the top firms in the country and I said, I want to sell the highest quality liquid vitamin D3 under the tongue because the science shows that's the best way to take it.
[01:18:10.335 --> 01:18:11.075]  They said, absolutely.
[01:18:11.155 --> 01:18:16.260]  Then a few years ago, they pointed out, Vitamin K with D3 helps it upload in the cells even better.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:17.060]  It's now available.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:17.981]  Wear a sun plus.

[01:19:00.251 --> 01:19:03.656]  Globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[01:19:03.736 --> 01:19:05.719]  They are forcing mutations.
[01:19:06.119 --> 01:19:09.164]  This is forced evolution, or de-evolution.
[01:19:09.424 --> 01:19:17.015]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter, or folks that live longer, or are more moral.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.343]  No, it's turning humanity into a commodity.
[01:19:20.863 --> 01:19:27.829]  Now we see some propaganda like Communist China bragging, hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers supermen.
[01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:31.413]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[01:19:31.853 --> 01:19:37.939]  Well, the same thing's been happening to our troops, and thousands and thousands have died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:42.580]  And I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas Health Department.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:46.041]  They say, Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good.
[01:19:46.522 --> 01:19:47.622]  But that's not even true.
[01:19:47.982 --> 01:19:51.683]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[01:19:51.903 --> 01:19:54.844]  This is violence being carried out against us by medical tyranny.
[01:19:55.004 --> 01:19:57.385]  We have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[01:20:02.392 --> 01:20:08.338]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:16.267 --> 01:20:20.732]  Alright, Joe Hoffs with GatewayPundit.com.
[01:20:22.128 --> 01:20:32.155]  is a anti-fraud researcher, a big corporate auditor, and he's just dedicated all his time, been drafted into the fight with his brother over at Gateway Pundit, has become a major leader in the fight.
[01:20:32.615 --> 01:20:35.197]  So this is like a nine-minute segment, longer segment coming up.
[01:20:35.257 --> 01:20:36.678]  I'm gonna try to shut up, give you the floor.
[01:20:37.759 --> 01:20:42.041]  Where do we start with all the huge developments really documenting election fraud?
[01:20:42.061 --> 01:20:42.742]  There's so many.
[01:20:43.783 --> 01:20:44.423]  Please tell us about them.
[01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:47.345]  Yeah, thanks, Alex, and thanks again for having me on.
[01:20:47.665 --> 01:20:48.506]  It's great to be here.
[01:20:49.026 --> 01:20:49.486]  It's an honor.
[01:20:50.871 --> 01:20:54.594]  I guess the thing that is, if we go back to the start, we always knew something was going to happen.
[01:20:55.134 --> 01:21:02.659]  And, um, we just had, we just knew that because, uh, because of all the coups that have been in place already, the Mueller and, and the impeachment, et cetera.
[01:21:02.699 --> 01:21:09.043]  So it came really as no surprise that something would happen, although it, it still, uh, was, uh, it's still upset.
[01:21:09.204 --> 01:21:13.446]  You know, everybody watching the election night, uh, proceedings where Trump's way ahead.
[01:21:13.466 --> 01:21:20.011]  We go to bed about four in the morning and it looks like Trump's got it wrapped up, but not, not as nearly as much as we expected.
[01:21:20.569 --> 01:21:27.611]  And then to wake up to see these major changes in some of these key swing states where suddenly Trump's behind.
[01:21:28.111 --> 01:21:34.013]  It didn't take us but a couple hours to realize there were some major data dumps that occurred in these swing states.
[01:21:34.133 --> 01:21:37.214]  So that was kind of the first shock.
[01:21:37.734 --> 01:21:43.376]  And then that put everybody on defensive from everybody that, you know, all the Trump supporters, which I believe is maybe 80.
[01:21:43.696 --> 01:21:46.137]  Some people suggest even 90 million votes for Trump.
[01:21:46.842 --> 01:21:50.191]  Certainly Biden didn't get the $80 million that they're saying.
[01:21:50.733 --> 01:21:54.603]  And we can see this just from an auditor's perspective, Alex.
[01:21:55.086 --> 01:21:59.628]  Just take a look at the big picture, and this is something you would do when you start an audit.
[01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:02.449]  You'd do a lot of planning, but you'd certainly look at the big picture.
[01:22:02.549 --> 01:22:07.911]  Okay, what was the most votes anybody had ever accumulated in an election?
[01:22:07.931 --> 01:22:12.272]  Well, that was Obama with 69 million in 2008, and so President Trump has 65 million, or 62 million actually, in the last election.
[01:22:17.898 --> 01:22:21.400]  With Hillary supposedly accumulating $65 million.
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:29.724]  So immediately we see Trump surpassing this record of Obama's of going past $70 million.
[01:22:30.364 --> 01:22:31.244]  Nobody in U.S.
[01:22:31.284 --> 01:22:32.405]  history had ever done that.
[01:22:33.265 --> 01:22:41.389]  But for us that were following Trump, it wasn't surprising because we kept track of his progress during the primaries.
[01:22:41.469 --> 01:22:47.332]  And despite the media's bogus polls that were saying that Biden was ahead, which were
[01:22:47.691 --> 01:22:48.832]  Garbage from the start.
[01:22:50.134 --> 01:22:53.458]  We knew that Trump was doing great and we could see it through boat parades and
[01:22:53.945 --> 01:22:57.406]  Which were amazing that were happening every weekend, it seemed like, around the country.
[01:22:57.486 --> 01:23:01.506]  Very big, huge, massive gatherings of boats with Trump flags and everything.
[01:23:01.806 --> 01:23:04.067]  We saw cars the day before the election.
[01:23:04.527 --> 01:23:05.227]  Every U.S.
[01:23:05.387 --> 01:23:13.929]  city had cars, even I've seen in New York City, and trucks with Trump flags behind them in a parade, marching, you know, marching around the country.
[01:23:13.969 --> 01:23:19.349]  And so, we knew there was an energy for President Trump that we'd never seen before.
[01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:22.130]  So it's no surprise that President Trump
[01:23:22.495 --> 01:23:27.743]  Surpass 70 million became the first individual in US history to do so legitimately.
[01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:36.177]  And right now he's around 74 million, but the big picture is there's absolutely no way that Joe Biden had
[01:23:36.735 --> 01:23:38.195]  Accumulated 80 million votes.
[01:23:38.335 --> 01:23:40.016]  It was a, that's a joke.
[01:23:40.076 --> 01:23:40.956]  It's a travesty.
[01:23:40.996 --> 01:23:48.998]  And again, it's the deep state and these people that hate Trump, the elites, China, the Democrats, just another slap in the face.
[01:23:49.038 --> 01:24:02.742]  Like we saw so many times during his first term where he would make a major event just to see the Democrats behind the scene, smashing him or Rosenstein with some bogus, uh, Russia collusion type of a narrative come out at the same time.
[01:24:02.782 --> 01:24:05.003]  He's meeting with some world leaders and doing great things.
[01:24:05.683 --> 01:24:06.083]  And, uh,
[01:24:06.587 --> 01:24:14.672]  So it was really, it was really nasty as looking back at it, how they'd stolen again, the greatest election ever.
[01:24:14.692 --> 01:24:17.374]  And, and they're saying Joe Biden got 80 million.
[01:24:17.394 --> 01:24:18.434]  So that's just a joke.
[01:24:18.494 --> 01:24:20.055]  And we know it is, and we knew it right away.
[01:24:20.156 --> 01:24:23.918]  So we started looking into the fraud, like so many people.
[01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:31.718]  And we could see really immediately the main thing was the events that were happening in Detroit and Philadelphia.
[01:24:32.319 --> 01:24:33.799]  We have a friend that was in Detroit.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.862]  They were preventing her from getting into the facility to even be an observer.
[01:24:40.743 --> 01:24:44.725]  When she was in there, there was a group of people probably paid for by the U.S.
[01:24:44.745 --> 01:24:51.808]  taxpayer that looked like they were Black Lives Matter that were harassing every single observer every single minute, telling them, hey,
[01:24:52.429 --> 01:24:53.533]  Lift your mask up.
[01:24:53.793 --> 01:24:54.997]  You're getting too close.
[01:24:55.358 --> 01:24:58.889]  Stand back for hours at a time.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.822]  So, and there wasn't a Republican at every table.
[01:25:03.242 --> 01:25:11.589]  Every Republican had to walk in with a big sign on their chest that told everybody that they're Republican, something no one else had to do.
[01:25:11.929 --> 01:25:16.972]  These individuals that were the harassers, they didn't even have name tags, don't even know who they were.
[01:25:16.992 --> 01:25:25.118]  And then when our friend noted that the military ballots came out, first of all, they tried to get everybody out of the room.
[01:25:25.599 --> 01:25:28.401]  And then when they came in, this one friend of ours,
[01:25:28.936 --> 01:25:35.660]  Forced her way back into this massive room with thousands upon thousands of ballots that were brought in.
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:38.461]  And she noticed right away all of these ballots looked the same.
[01:25:38.481 --> 01:25:39.682]  There were carbon copies.
[01:25:39.722 --> 01:25:41.963]  There was something wrong with them.
[01:25:42.423 --> 01:25:45.425]  And they started going through those and they were all for Joe Biden.
[01:25:45.625 --> 01:25:48.406]  So that was Detroit, Philadelphia.
[01:25:48.446 --> 01:25:53.289]  We saw the stories where Republicans, again, there weren't even allowed to look at the process either.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:26:07.250]  Recently, Scott Adams from Dilbert did a tweet where he said, all we have to say is, we were forcibly not allowed to review the results.
[01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:16.457]  And that immediately makes the election a fraud and contaminates the entire election.
[01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:22.382]  How can you have an election when one side's not even allowed to be involved in the counting process?
[01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:27.712]  You know, it's, it's, it's... And what you just said, Joe Hoffman, GatewayPundit.com, is central.
[01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:40.017]  The State Department and the U.N., our own government, says if they don't allow observers in to point-blank do it and review and check and do an audit, spot audits, it's not a legitimate election.
[01:26:40.377 --> 01:26:41.558]  They're not even letting people in the room.
[01:26:41.638 --> 01:26:42.278]  They're 50 feet away.
[01:26:42.318 --> 01:26:43.158]  This is ridiculous.
[01:26:43.918 --> 01:26:44.859]  Yeah.
[01:26:44.939 --> 01:26:45.819]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:26:45.839 --> 01:26:47.460]  And then, and then other things, too.
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:52.602]  Leading up to the election, the ballot process, how they had these drop boxes.
[01:26:53.001 --> 01:26:56.082]  We're finding that these things were like, they weren't well controlled.
[01:26:56.102 --> 01:26:57.543]  There was no chain of custody.
[01:26:57.583 --> 01:27:03.605]  There was no dual controls, meaning that whenever you pick up ballots, you treat it like money, like tellers at a bank.
[01:27:04.105 --> 01:27:08.186]  And you would guard it with one person from each party.
[01:27:08.226 --> 01:27:16.009]  A Democrat and Republican would pick up together, transport these ballots together, and then do the counting together at all points of the process.
[01:27:16.369 --> 01:27:23.275]  There's a dual control and there's a chain of custody where these ballots are never outside of somebody's presence, a counter's presence.
[01:27:23.295 --> 01:27:25.136]  So that wasn't happening.
[01:27:25.156 --> 01:27:28.099]  And that's where a lot of fraud occurred.
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:30.701]  And we've seen it since.
[01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:31.862]  And we can get into that some.
[01:27:31.902 --> 01:27:42.450]  But just recently in Wisconsin, we had some guys reach out to us and say during the recount process there, they saw thousands of these votes that were coming in that were
[01:27:44.811 --> 01:27:46.052]  They look like photocopies.
[01:27:46.112 --> 01:27:49.715]  They didn't have any indentations on them.
[01:27:49.855 --> 01:27:54.720]  I mean, even Georgia, as corrupt as the government is, admits that it's not folded.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.622]  It's all printed by a computer.
[01:27:57.642 --> 01:27:58.763]  But there's big developments.
[01:27:58.783 --> 01:28:10.153]  The Gateway Pundit and Washington Examiner and National File and Info Wars today with these new forensics firms that the judges have authorized the release, saying it's like complete fraud.
[01:28:10.173 --> 01:28:11.193]  Can we talk about that when we come back?
[01:28:12.233 --> 01:28:13.093]  Yeah, let's do that.
[01:28:13.153 --> 01:28:13.754]  That's great.
[01:28:13.894 --> 01:28:15.414]  That's a great segue to that.
[01:28:15.454 --> 01:28:15.914]  And what else?
[01:28:15.934 --> 01:28:16.855]  You've got a lot on your radar.
[01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:17.715]  What else are you guys working on?
[01:28:17.735 --> 01:28:18.916]  Because you're breaking so much stuff.
[01:28:19.456 --> 01:28:20.316]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[01:28:20.376 --> 01:28:25.158]  And yeah, we can talk, too, about just the numbers, and that's kind of my expertise.
[01:28:25.198 --> 01:28:31.401]  We started digging into the numbers after we were first initially looking at the activities, the voter fraud.
[01:28:35.302 --> 01:28:36.983]  Individuals weren't allowed to count.
[01:28:37.003 --> 01:28:38.244]  People weren't allowed to vote.
[01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:39.385]  Things like that.
[01:28:39.445 --> 01:28:43.128]  So the cover-up and the violation of law right there throws the election out.
[01:28:43.448 --> 01:28:45.790]  Then you've got them putting the $80 million balance outside of law.
[01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:46.571]  That throws it out.
[01:28:46.911 --> 01:28:48.812]  So why is the Supreme Court and others doing this?
[01:28:48.992 --> 01:28:50.393]  What do you expect to happen to?
[01:28:50.453 --> 01:28:52.015]  Can Trump find a path to victory?
[01:28:52.315 --> 01:28:54.156]  With Joe Hoff of GatewayPundit.com.
[01:28:54.396 --> 01:28:56.058]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:28:59.895 --> 01:29:01.716]  Let's go to old dude in Missouri.
[01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:02.216]  Old dude.
[01:29:02.236 --> 01:29:02.736]  Thanks for holding.
[01:29:02.756 --> 01:29:03.016]  Go ahead.
[01:29:03.156 --> 01:29:03.757]  First off, man.
[01:29:03.937 --> 01:29:05.477]  Hey, I just want to thank you for what you've done.
[01:29:05.517 --> 01:29:06.578]  I know you hear that a lot.
[01:29:06.618 --> 01:29:10.119]  You've been very influential in a lot of people's lives.
[01:29:10.159 --> 01:29:15.121]  Second thing I want to say is the bodies and the X2 is amazing.
[01:29:15.341 --> 01:29:16.542]  I played football in college.
[01:29:16.642 --> 01:29:21.544]  I had some injuries and the bodies allows me to do things that most people my age just can't do.
[01:29:21.764 --> 01:29:27.706]  I mean, I went out and played flag football here a few weeks ago and was running with guys that were in their early 20s and I'm almost 40.
[01:29:28.226 --> 01:29:29.467]  So the products are awesome.
[01:29:29.787 --> 01:29:37.109]  As far as what Donald Trump could do is make a call out to all local law enforcement and militias to organize all able-bodied patriots.
[01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:43.852]  And now I realize he would be signaling to the people who have control over things in the economy and they could take some steps.
[01:29:44.352 --> 01:29:50.414]  But if we can organize together, I feel like that could be an effective thing that we could do to keep our own local communities safe.
[01:29:50.774 --> 01:29:51.414]  That's right, brother.
[01:29:51.514 --> 01:29:54.676]  It is a spiritual war, and we see the enemy attacking.
[01:29:55.256 --> 01:29:57.618]  That's because the enemy knows it's in trouble.
[01:29:57.698 --> 01:29:58.858]  It's been forced out in the open.
[01:29:59.098 --> 01:30:03.060]  So as negative as this is at one level, I see it as very, very positive at others.
[01:30:03.761 --> 01:30:09.584]  So people need to organize, and they need to stand on the foundation of reality that God has provided us.
[01:30:09.944 --> 01:30:22.759]  Through Jesus Christ and the people who brought the message forth to the world and understand that we have God on our side because the literal essence of his truth is written in his words and communicated to humanity.
[01:30:35.124 --> 01:30:42.966]  Not David Rockefeller, not Bill Gates, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, but Jesus Christ is King!
[01:30:45.466 --> 01:30:51.207]  And God gave us and rose up Donald Trump to stand against the enemy and draw out the enemy.
[01:30:51.587 --> 01:30:58.989]  So as dark as some of these days are, understand this is the beginning of the great revival before the Antichrist comes!
[01:30:59.884 --> 01:31:01.685]  Stacy in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:31:01.845 --> 01:31:04.687]  Long time listener, over 15 years, first time caller.
[01:31:05.027 --> 01:31:10.630]  I take all your products, I take everything, and that's why I can think clearly, and this is the way I see it.
[01:31:10.670 --> 01:31:13.972]  I think there needs to be simultaneous operations going on.
[01:31:14.092 --> 01:31:18.195]  First thing is, Trump appoints Sidney Powell as a special counsel.
[01:31:18.735 --> 01:31:25.799]  Give her marshals, federal marshals, give her a few Delta Force guys, come here to Maricopa County where I'm at, and the rest of these twin states,
[01:31:26.192 --> 01:31:28.093]  Stick these doors in and take the machines.
[01:31:28.474 --> 01:31:31.095]  These little pencil-necked lawyers can't do anything to stop it.
[01:31:31.496 --> 01:31:42.923]  Once they get the machines, while they're doing that, they need to take Don Lemonhead and the rest of these knuckleheads off the news, put patriots in those positions, because the sheeple will believe what they see on TV.
[01:31:43.504 --> 01:31:53.671]  Once they start broadcasting what's going on, they need to arrest Nancy Pelosi and the rest of these traitors that are in Congress, in both the House and the Senate, on both sides.
[01:31:54.091 --> 01:31:55.172]  Take them to Guantanamo.
[01:31:55.652 --> 01:31:59.096]  While they're having a tribunal, they need to show this on TV.
[01:31:59.697 --> 01:32:03.241]  A week of tribunals, find them guilty, and start executing.
[01:32:03.321 --> 01:32:06.384]  The only questions they ask is, do you get the rope or the bullet?
[01:32:07.222 --> 01:32:07.962]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:32:08.663 --> 01:32:10.344]  The globalists do have all these agents.
[01:32:10.384 --> 01:32:20.490]  Nancy Pelosi is keeping swallows well on the Intelligence Committee, even though he's a penetrated Chinese communist agent who was ordered by Chinese intelligence to say Russia ran our elections.
[01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:23.872]  And my issue is I want due process.
[01:32:23.912 --> 01:32:25.353]  I want these globalists to get trials.
[01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:29.874]  I think he should go full force on the plan I just laid out.
[01:32:29.894 --> 01:32:32.514]  Because you know where this is going Alex.
[01:32:32.534 --> 01:32:34.995]  You know these people are demonic.
[01:32:35.035 --> 01:32:36.475]  They're never going to stop.
[01:32:36.535 --> 01:32:37.476]  If Trump gets out of there,
[01:32:53.579 --> 01:32:57.523]  They're going after him and they're coming after us Christians and they're coming after us.
[01:32:58.204 --> 01:32:59.185]  That's no doubt about it.
[01:33:02.789 --> 01:33:08.675]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.794 --> 01:33:21.918]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:22.658 --> 01:33:24.100]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:31.192 --> 01:33:31.793]  We are back.
[01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:46.990]  Well, it's being reported out of Nevada right now, and I'm going to call, while Joe's talking, I don't normally ignore my guests, I'm going to call my Trump lawyer that's one of the top people in Nevada about this, while Joe is talking here, just real fast.
[01:33:47.431 --> 01:33:50.494]  Nevada GOP electors cast ballots for Donald J. Trump.
[01:33:51.235 --> 01:33:52.275]  That is being reported right now.
[01:33:52.295 --> 01:33:55.776]  Another slate of electors for Donald Trump is voted upon by the state legislature.
[01:33:56.357 --> 01:34:00.998]  Nevada joins PA, Georgia, in sending to Congress a dueling slate of electors.
[01:34:01.038 --> 01:34:15.202]  So, this is huge news that normally you'd have the electors go one way, but if there's a problem, they can say, we're not going to vote for that person, and that forces the legislature to then take over, or they can let those electors go forward.
[01:34:15.242 --> 01:34:16.123]  So, wow!
[01:34:16.703 --> 01:34:20.744]  When Trump said, folks aren't going to be happy in a few days, is this what he was talking about, Joe Hoft?
[01:34:22.383 --> 01:34:23.323]  That's great news, Alex.
[01:34:23.984 --> 01:34:26.545]  And it's really scary times, precarious times that we're in.
[01:34:27.986 --> 01:34:30.647]  Perhaps I could jump back to where we were at a couple of weeks ago.
[01:34:30.727 --> 01:34:31.007]  Oh, no, no.
[01:34:31.027 --> 01:34:31.708]  You've got the floor.
[01:34:33.469 --> 01:34:34.389]  Lay out the compendium.
[01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:35.910]  Yeah, great.
[01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:37.511]  Well, I'll lead into that.
[01:34:37.871 --> 01:34:46.575]  The thing that we noticed after really the voter fraud and the massive voter fraud that was occurring was we just kind of started looking at the data and we found anomalies.
[01:34:46.615 --> 01:34:48.776]  And the anomalies were patterns in the data.
[01:34:49.397 --> 01:34:52.118]  And so where you would expect to see random numbers,
[01:34:52.743 --> 01:34:53.623]  We weren't seeing that.
[01:34:53.663 --> 01:34:54.944]  We were seeing patterns.
[01:34:54.984 --> 01:35:06.887]  And the first thing that we noticed was in Pennsylvania, where during Election Day, President Trump won some counties by like 80 to 20, 80% to 20.
[01:35:07.287 --> 01:35:10.568]  He just crushed it in Pennsylvania on Election Day.
[01:35:10.908 --> 01:35:15.329]  He was up about $2 million to $1 million almost by the end of the day.
[01:35:15.934 --> 01:35:19.759]  And then they, at the same time, they began counting the absentee ballots.
[01:35:19.839 --> 01:35:24.544]  Well, by the end of the night, when we all went to bed, Trump was ahead by about 700,000 votes.
[01:35:27.333 --> 01:35:35.138]  And somehow a million or more ballots were manufactured that gave Biden the lead, which we believe is totally fraudulent.
[01:35:35.178 --> 01:35:41.583]  We think there's a lot of room for a review there where you would find massive quantities of fraudulent votes.
[01:35:41.623 --> 01:35:52.770]  But the one thing that we saw that could help support that situation is the fact that in the state, in every county where Trump won on Election Day,
[01:35:53.339 --> 01:35:58.084]  They would take 40% less than that, and that was what Trump won in the absentee ballots.
[01:35:58.484 --> 01:36:03.390]  And so what I'm saying is that if Trump won 80 to 20 on election day in a county, he won only 40% of the absentee ballot.
[01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:08.815]  If he won 70% of the vote on election day, he only won 30% of the absentee ballot.
[01:36:15.543 --> 01:36:18.466]  And this went across the board for virtually every county.
[01:36:18.766 --> 01:36:20.188]  And so we knew something's going on.
[01:36:20.228 --> 01:36:22.550]  You wouldn't see the same pattern everywhere.
[01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:25.152]  We compared it to the state of Arkansas.
[01:36:25.292 --> 01:36:27.795]  In that state, the numbers were more random.
[01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:30.918]  And never, only once, did we see a disparity of 40%.
[01:36:31.779 --> 01:36:34.021]  So we knew something was going on with Pennsylvania.
[01:36:34.676 --> 01:36:37.319]  At the same time, there was some other research done by others.
[01:36:37.339 --> 01:36:45.028]  There's a Dr. Shiva out of MIT, and he came up with an analysis in Michigan, where he, again, he didn't see randomness.
[01:36:45.329 --> 01:36:46.310]  He saw a pattern.
[01:36:46.650 --> 01:36:54.359]  And the pattern was that in these countries... Well, listen, I'm going to say that in a minute, because you documented it well, and that's all I'll get with Punnett.com, but it's not just... I don't have to be a statistician.
[01:36:55.821 --> 01:37:01.564]  They say the voting stops, they say they've closed the polling place, and then right when it reopens, it shoots straight up for Joe Biden.
[01:37:01.604 --> 01:37:05.546]  I mean, everything else is organic curve, then it shoots straight up.
[01:37:05.606 --> 01:37:07.347]  I mean, that doesn't happen in nature.
[01:37:08.248 --> 01:37:12.230]  Well, and that was actually another thing that we identified, Alex.
[01:37:12.710 --> 01:37:17.433]  We started with Virginia of all states, because I know a guy who's in Virginia said, these numbers don't look right.
[01:37:17.553 --> 01:37:19.194]  Trump was way ahead.
[01:37:19.634 --> 01:37:21.875]  He was crushing Biden in Virginia.
[01:37:22.276 --> 01:37:24.357]  And then suddenly, overnight,
[01:37:25.029 --> 01:37:27.733]  The same thing happened in Virginia that happened in these other states.
[01:37:28.333 --> 01:37:30.636]  Massive drops of ballots.
[01:37:30.656 --> 01:37:36.364]  Which as a big corporate auditor for fraud, you know, this shows what, controller fraud.
[01:37:36.464 --> 01:37:41.450]  It shows a centralized group was doing this, and that's what legislative leaders have said is, this is racketeering.
[01:37:42.233 --> 01:37:42.953]  That's right, Alex.
[01:37:42.993 --> 01:37:55.081]  And even in Virginia, what was really odd, and this is the accountant in me as well, we saw 300,000 votes get populated for Biden and only 30,000 for Trump.
[01:37:55.601 --> 01:38:02.425]  Then they reversed that out, then they reposted it, and then they reversed it out, and then they reposted it again.
[01:38:03.038 --> 01:38:04.459]  None of those entries make sense.
[01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:06.120]  What the hell was going on?
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:12.303]  It was like shows they did a very sloppy job because they could have been shaving throughout the night, but they didn't.
[01:38:12.323 --> 01:38:13.684]  They just did it in one big swoop.
[01:38:14.524 --> 01:38:14.745]  Yep.
[01:38:14.845 --> 01:38:18.106]  And so $300,000 for Biden, $30,000 for Trump.
[01:38:18.407 --> 01:38:20.288]  And at that point, why were they so reckless?
[01:38:20.308 --> 01:38:21.188]  Why were they so reckless?
[01:38:21.948 --> 01:38:23.669]  I believe this because they were racing through it.
[01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:28.812]  You know, they had to, they realized their, as people have said, their algorithms weren't working.
[01:38:28.912 --> 01:38:30.113]  Trump's crushed it.
[01:38:30.441 --> 01:38:33.803]  They never expected Trump to have more votes than Obama did.
[01:38:34.464 --> 01:38:36.365]  They had no respect for this guy.
[01:38:36.385 --> 01:38:38.026]  The landslide overwhelmed them.
[01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:42.669]  They thought three months of fake ballots and dead cats voting would overwhelm them.
[01:38:42.689 --> 01:38:51.415]  When it didn't, they crapped their pants, ran in, stopped the voting, stopped the counting, kicked everybody out, pulled out the suitcases, pulled out the backup plan.
[01:38:52.352 --> 01:38:52.872]  That's right.
[01:38:53.072 --> 01:38:53.713]  Absolutely.
[01:38:53.833 --> 01:38:58.116]  And we saw then in Georgia where they kicked everybody out, what they called a water main break.
[01:38:58.176 --> 01:39:06.541]  And I don't know if we talked about this before, but I had an attorney, I had an attorney reach out to me and said, Joe, I ran a four year request on that with the state.
[01:39:06.561 --> 01:39:07.922]  They have to get back to me in three days.
[01:39:08.322 --> 01:39:13.605]  The only thing they had was a text message where somebody sent a text message to the head of the Atlanta Hawks.
[01:39:13.625 --> 01:39:16.567]  And he said, Oh no, that was greatly, that was greatly overstated.
[01:39:17.014 --> 01:39:18.094]  And we've reported that.
[01:39:18.454 --> 01:39:26.177]  And then the next day, somebody from the Water Department actually reached out to me and said, Joe, there were no calls in Georgia for a water main break.
[01:39:26.217 --> 01:39:33.879]  Sure, and then the same people close everything, kick everybody out, pull out the suitcases, and they're all Democrat Party operatives.
[01:39:33.979 --> 01:39:34.839]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:39:35.399 --> 01:39:40.123]  And they're just shoving those ballots through those tabulators over and over again.
[01:39:40.143 --> 01:39:45.087]  We saw some of these people in those videos three times shooting the same chunk of ballots through.
[01:39:45.347 --> 01:39:49.450]  And they're, you know, they're robbing a bank, like they're in a safe, just like grabbing cash.
[01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:51.352]  I mean, they're all real lazy till...
[01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:54.893]  They kick everybody out as fast as they can.
[01:39:54.933 --> 01:39:55.673]  You're right.
[01:39:56.113 --> 01:39:56.794]  Absolutely right.
[01:39:57.114 --> 01:39:58.754]  And so that's what happened in Georgia.
[01:39:58.834 --> 01:40:05.676]  And then we saw Wisconsin massive 100,000 there with Michigan more than 100,000 there.
[01:40:05.976 --> 01:40:07.677]  All of a sudden Trump's behind in these states.
[01:40:07.997 --> 01:40:21.521]  But here's the another anomaly that we saw, Alex, in the data was that once Biden reached that lead, which is early in the morning, the day after the election, where they did these massive drops, then every single entry
[01:40:22.196 --> 01:40:30.399]  After that point was in the specific ratio of Biden to Trump, usually Biden, depending on the state, 51% to 49.
[01:40:30.859 --> 01:40:33.400]  They got more nuanced after the desperate dump of the night.
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:38.622]  Every split and every single entry after that had this same ratio.
[01:40:38.922 --> 01:40:40.883]  So we know something's going on.
[01:40:40.923 --> 01:40:41.923]  This doesn't make sense.
[01:40:41.963 --> 01:40:45.264]  That shows somebody said, hey guys, it's too obvious to have it 90% for Biden.
[01:40:45.524 --> 01:40:49.566]  Do this ratio because they have a mathematical equation showing that'll give him the win.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:52.321]  Yeah, it absolutely didn't make sense.
[01:40:52.762 --> 01:40:55.303]  And so, we know the data's wrong.
[01:40:55.664 --> 01:40:58.486]  And we know there's voter fraud.
[01:40:58.566 --> 01:40:59.807]  By the way, you published articles.
[01:40:59.827 --> 01:41:00.507]  I want to go back here.
[01:41:01.868 --> 01:41:02.389]  You've shown this.
[01:41:02.429 --> 01:41:03.209]  It's been proven accurate.
[01:41:03.930 --> 01:41:09.214]  All over these states, the key battle areas, the same number comes after with the ratio.
[01:41:09.234 --> 01:41:10.595]  That's impossible, basically.
[01:41:10.815 --> 01:41:11.115]  It is.
[01:41:11.415 --> 01:41:12.716]  It's absolutely impossible.
[01:41:14.355 --> 01:41:21.780]  And then I guess the other thing that kind of led us to all that was that people started seeing these glitches and they call them glitches.
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:31.686]  And it was like in Michigan where this Antrim County where they saw 6,000 votes or roughly 3,000 were removed from Trump and given to Biden.
[01:41:31.846 --> 01:41:34.208]  And so they caught that and they had to reverse this.
[01:41:34.868 --> 01:41:37.530]  When you double it up, it's a 6,000 vote difference.
[01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:39.871]  And that was just one small county.
[01:41:39.931 --> 01:41:42.212]  I'd say maybe average-sized county.
[01:41:42.252 --> 01:41:43.693]  I think somebody corrected me on it.
[01:41:43.713 --> 01:41:44.574]  We're not that small.
[01:41:44.594 --> 01:41:48.216]  Sure, so they were able to break in computer-wise or had operatives that good people founded?
[01:41:48.756 --> 01:41:51.478]  Why do they reverse it in these key counties around the country, but not the big ones?
[01:41:52.618 --> 01:41:53.279]  Well, there you go.
[01:41:53.319 --> 01:41:57.201]  I think what we've learned, we've seen a couple people share some information with us.
[01:41:57.521 --> 01:42:00.963]  What we think happened was at the precinct level,
[01:42:01.607 --> 01:42:01.847]  Thank you
[01:42:13.666 --> 01:42:21.393]  Two months or so, I guess, of the election is the results from an audit of Antrim County in Michigan were released.
[01:42:21.833 --> 01:42:25.276]  And what we find there is a couple major, major breaking issues.
[01:42:25.537 --> 01:42:32.923]  One is the fact that indeed they were swapping votes between Trump and Biden and giving them to Biden.
[01:42:33.203 --> 01:42:36.987]  And the other more significant event that's in there is that
[01:42:37.523 --> 01:42:48.846]  There is a connection to outsiders from this system and that's the one thing they couldn't get, the one thing that was deleted, is who this data was being sent to.
[01:42:49.486 --> 01:42:53.407]  But we do know that this data was being shared off-site.
[01:42:53.427 --> 01:42:53.767]  Wow, okay.
[01:42:53.787 --> 01:42:55.048]  Joe Haw, final segment.
[01:42:55.068 --> 01:42:59.789]  I want to look at the new stuff that just came out you guys have been breaking, with the Michigan judge releasing this info.
[01:43:10.354 --> 01:43:11.755]  The globalists want you sick.
[01:43:12.555 --> 01:43:14.016]  They want you emasculated.
[01:43:14.136 --> 01:43:15.337]  They want you dehumanized.
[01:43:15.617 --> 01:43:16.738]  They want you dumbed down.
[01:43:17.258 --> 01:43:20.440]  They want you to be a weak, pathetic slave.
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:28.044]  And they start that control system by dumbing you down for birth and never letting you know the truth of what is unfolding.
[01:43:28.384 --> 01:43:29.865]  It is simply disgusting.
[01:43:30.545 --> 01:43:33.588]  Ever hear the establishment telling you that vitamin D3 is vital?
[01:43:33.628 --> 01:43:41.836]  You ever hear them explain to you that 40 plus percent of the public is vitamin D3 deficient and so many diseases and chronic problems are caused by it?
[01:43:41.916 --> 01:43:42.197]  No!
[01:43:42.377 --> 01:43:48.423]  Even though it's known scientific fact like gravity or the temperature at which water boils.
[01:43:48.723 --> 01:43:49.324]  These are facts.
[01:43:49.684 --> 01:43:50.224]  Well guess what?
[01:43:50.304 --> 01:43:52.807]  Winter Sun, after being sold out for months, is now back in stock.
[01:43:53.027 --> 01:43:56.788]  I didn't just get into the vitamin D3 game when it became so huge last year.
[01:43:56.848 --> 01:43:59.469]  We've been promoting it for more than 15 years with sponsors.
[01:43:59.589 --> 01:44:02.150]  Then about eight years ago, I started InfoWorks Life.
[01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:10.172]  I approached one of the top firms in the country and I said, I want to sell the highest quality liquid vitamin D3 under the tongue because the science shows that's the best way to take it.
[01:44:10.212 --> 01:44:10.972]  They said, absolutely.
[01:44:11.052 --> 01:44:16.115]  Then a few years ago, they pointed out, Vitamin K with D3 helps it upload in the cells even better.
[01:44:16.215 --> 01:44:16.916]  It's now available.
[01:44:16.936 --> 01:44:17.856]  Wear a sun plus.
[01:44:17.936 --> 01:44:20.798]  Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K at infowarshore.com.
[01:44:20.918 --> 01:44:21.659]  Sold out for months.

[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:29.284]  Your friends, your family, your children, your neighbors, especially those that work inside all the time and don't get sun.
[01:44:29.384 --> 01:44:31.085]  Especially people with dark skin.
[01:44:31.385 --> 01:44:32.887]  You need more D3 than others.

[01:45:01.169 --> 01:45:08.732]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins, ingratiating goblins, in bed with a goblin.
[01:45:08.892 --> 01:45:18.156]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins, succubus with goblins, ingratiating goblins, in bed with a goblin.
[01:45:18.176 --> 01:45:24.319]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins, ingratiating goblins, in bed with a goblin.
[01:45:24.339 --> 01:45:28.381]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins, ingratiating goblins,
[01:45:33.729 --> 01:45:34.189]  I think?
[01:46:32.648 --> 01:46:34.069]  Oh, no, no, I don't even know what this is.
[01:46:34.089 --> 01:46:35.970]  How did you get here?
[01:46:35.991 --> 01:46:38.012]  I just caught you, American.
[01:46:38.332 --> 01:46:40.394]  You visited Bandar Video.
[01:46:40.414 --> 01:46:44.597]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[01:46:45.097 --> 01:46:50.681]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you.
[01:46:50.841 --> 01:46:52.002]  Conflue.
[01:46:53.343 --> 01:46:58.087]  It comes from China.
[01:47:01.983 --> 01:47:06.068]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:07.891]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:17.219 --> 01:47:20.402]  There's a man going around taking names.
[01:47:20.962 --> 01:47:22.364]  Okay, I've got the articles right here.
[01:47:22.384 --> 01:47:29.871]  You've got this very respected, big data-crunching forensics firm out of Dallas that got into the documents in Michigan and other states.
[01:47:30.351 --> 01:47:30.812]  They've come out.
[01:47:30.832 --> 01:47:32.753]  I've got the articles right here from Gateway Pundit.
[01:47:33.074 --> 01:47:35.716]  We've got it from the Washington Exam.
[01:47:35.736 --> 01:47:36.477]  We've got it from a lot.
[01:47:37.498 --> 01:47:38.178]  WorldNet Daily.
[01:47:38.699 --> 01:47:40.741]  Audit concludes Dominion Voting Machines.
[01:47:42.455 --> 01:47:42.775]  I think?
[01:47:58.834 --> 01:47:59.534]  And it goes on.
[01:48:00.015 --> 01:48:02.696]  So it's all starting to come out here.
[01:48:03.416 --> 01:48:06.698]  Joe Hoffs, who's been really heading up the tip of the spear in all this.
[01:48:07.318 --> 01:48:12.941]  What do you make of just the hardcore evidence coming out, and then the media just totally doesn't cover it?
[01:48:12.981 --> 01:48:13.401]  Same way.
[01:48:14.241 --> 01:48:14.701]  Nevada.
[01:48:15.822 --> 01:48:17.262]  We have right-side broadcasting.
[01:48:17.723 --> 01:48:20.064]  We'll play it after you're gone, but just 10 minutes ago.
[01:48:20.404 --> 01:48:22.145]  I'll play it next hour before Solympic comes on.
[01:48:23.286 --> 01:48:28.730]  And they're meeting with the GOP state reps and the electors saying, no, we're not going for this.
[01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:29.431]  It's fraudulent.
[01:48:29.751 --> 01:48:30.712]  We're going for Trump.
[01:48:31.132 --> 01:48:35.575]  And then I go to CNN, they say Nevada has gone for Joe Biden.
[01:48:36.196 --> 01:48:38.938]  So, I mean, I am speechless at this point.
[01:48:38.978 --> 01:48:40.739]  We are watching one thing on CNN.
[01:48:41.039 --> 01:48:42.460]  Nevada is all for Biden.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.041]  They give electoral votes.
[01:48:44.061 --> 01:48:44.522]  He wins it.
[01:48:44.562 --> 01:48:45.362]  That's on TV.
[01:48:45.442 --> 01:48:46.243]  That's five minutes ago.
[01:48:46.563 --> 01:48:49.585]  And then over here, I'm right side at a table with the GOP.
[01:48:50.566 --> 01:48:53.007]  With the damn electors and state reps saying, no, we're not.
[01:48:53.127 --> 01:48:54.327]  I mean, this is wild.
[01:48:54.947 --> 01:48:56.468]  Uh, what do you think's going on here?
[01:48:57.508 --> 01:49:00.029]  Well, it's been, it's been, it's been amazing.
[01:49:00.069 --> 01:49:00.909]  Hasn't it Alex?
[01:49:00.969 --> 01:49:06.310]  Since the election, especially it was like election night, everything absolutely turned.
[01:49:06.671 --> 01:49:12.672]  I mean, how many people that were watching Fox up to that night have, have never gone back, including myself.
[01:49:13.152 --> 01:49:15.073]  It's like, what, what was that?
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:20.422]  They're biased reporting how they would only report Biden leads.
[01:49:20.822 --> 01:49:27.785]  Trump's crushing it in Texas with 6% and yet they held back announcing whether Texas would go to Trump or not.
[01:49:28.106 --> 01:49:29.946]  And actually, I have a theory on that, Alex.
[01:49:30.006 --> 01:49:39.451]  I wonder if they were holding back because they had lots of fraudulent votes that they thought might steal that state and Trump crushed them and they couldn't do it.
[01:49:39.871 --> 01:49:42.352]  And we've actually, you know, seen some evidence
[01:49:42.725 --> 01:49:44.466]  That this happened everywhere.
[01:49:44.806 --> 01:49:55.033]  Even this morning, somebody sent me some information on a county in Indiana that had more people vote than they had population of legal voters in their county.
[01:49:55.293 --> 01:50:01.357]  So the truth is, this has been a gigantic, super mega massive landslide, a repudiation of the New World Order.
[01:50:01.777 --> 01:50:03.858]  They can't have that, so they engage in this fraud.
[01:50:03.898 --> 01:50:04.599]  Where does this go?
[01:50:04.899 --> 01:50:05.899]  What do we do in the next 37 days, Joe?
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.481]  Yeah, I know it Alex.
[01:50:09.782 --> 01:50:13.785]  And getting back to your question too, this dual reality that we're living in right now.
[01:50:14.085 --> 01:50:21.350]  So Washington Post came out a couple hours ago saying Trump loses case and has another case thrown out in Wisconsin.
[01:50:21.670 --> 01:50:26.353]  Of course they ignore that he had another ruling this morning which was in his favor.
[01:50:26.793 --> 01:50:35.241]  And now, what's gonna have to happen is Wisconsin is gonna have to go back and look at 240,000 votes to determine if they're valid or not.
[01:50:39.139 --> 01:50:52.068]  Washington Post ignores that, announces this other ruling that was against Trump, doesn't even mention this other ruling that's pro-Trump, which could easily throw Wisconsin into the Trump side.
[01:50:52.228 --> 01:50:57.371]  And let's talk about Texas case, they said was the best case, and a lot of lawyers I don't work for Trump told me, now this is our big case.
[01:50:57.852 --> 01:51:04.316]  The Supreme Court said, hey, you've got to be rejected, I guess by the electors first or whatever, before you have standing.
[01:51:04.896 --> 01:51:06.998]  So now they're just retooling the same lawsuits.
[01:51:07.298 --> 01:51:08.819]  What's your inside baseball on that?
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:11.980]  Yeah, I've heard that too.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.942]  It was really disappointing, I think, for anybody that was behind Trump.
[01:51:14.962 --> 01:51:17.863]  We'd heard a lot about this case, thinking that we would win it.
[01:51:17.883 --> 01:51:26.326]  And it was ironic that the three judges, the three Trump judges, didn't vote for it, you know, to move the thing forward, which was really kind of shocking and very disappointing.
[01:51:29.484 --> 01:51:43.637]  So, the next day, Sidney Powell immediately, she filed cases in four states again, this time specific cases for just the state using individuals from that state, and they think it's going to go through, and I hope so too.
[01:51:43.998 --> 01:51:49.523]  I mean, the massive fraud is what we need to deal with, and that hasn't been dealt with yet by anybody.
[01:51:51.665 --> 01:51:57.270]  Well, isn't that political fear by the Supreme Court that, oh, you can't take an election away when they say they're giving it to Biden?
[01:51:57.330 --> 01:51:58.471]  No, you're taking it from us.
[01:51:59.012 --> 01:52:08.481]  And you've got, and I'm not being mean to old people, and I'm not saying old, but a lot of old folks know more than young people who have got jobs and work in tech like you do and know things, but, you know, and I'm older too.
[01:52:08.961 --> 01:52:15.908]  But a lot of these old judges and stuff, I've been around them, high-level Texas judges, others, they literally don't know how anything works.
[01:52:16.529 --> 01:52:19.157]  And they're still watching CNN and Fox News.
[01:52:19.217 --> 01:52:21.826]  They don't know the rest of the world's not buying any of this.
[01:52:22.822 --> 01:52:26.204]  I agree and I wonder about those Supreme Court justices, the new ones especially.
[01:52:26.244 --> 01:52:26.904]  What are they reading?
[01:52:26.924 --> 01:52:28.285]  Where are they getting their information?
[01:52:28.746 --> 01:52:35.590]  Because, and by the way Alex, like you mentioned at the beginning of the show, we've been reporting the truth and we've been knocking it out of the park.
[01:52:35.630 --> 01:52:38.191]  We're getting 4 million people a day coming to our site.
[01:52:38.511 --> 01:52:41.553]  It's because people thirst for the truth and they will look to find it.
[01:52:41.893 --> 01:52:48.017]  And in spite of being censored and called names like you can relate to, being called everything in the book.
[01:52:48.675 --> 01:52:49.296]  the truth.
[01:53:02.416 --> 01:53:15.182]  These guys came in, they did this audit, and then the state stepped in, these villainous three women that are running the state, the Secretary of State, Attorney General, and Governor, and they tried to stop the results of this audit coming out.
[01:53:15.742 --> 01:53:21.664]  And it eventually went to this ruling this morning, and the judge let the report come out.
[01:53:21.904 --> 01:53:25.126]  And so, we've had to fight that along the way, too.
[01:53:25.146 --> 01:53:28.387]  That's right, because Tucker Carlson, who I love, is like, show me the proof.
[01:53:28.427 --> 01:53:30.088]  They're trying to block the forensic proof.
[01:53:30.148 --> 01:53:30.968]  Here it is, Tucker!
[01:53:31.388 --> 01:53:35.850]  Yeah, and there's only one reason you'd want to do that, you know, and it's just so clear.
[01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:37.191]  It's clear to everybody.
[01:53:37.671 --> 01:53:42.073]  Trump crushed it in this election, and they don't want people to know that.
[01:53:42.393 --> 01:53:49.457]  It's been an absolute grotesque steal, and they're trying to do everything they can to cover it up, whether it be in the courts or where else.
[01:53:49.517 --> 01:53:56.140]  And by the way, that one guy, Elias, that worked for Hillary, he is in about every court case that we've seen.
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:59.862]  Oh, he's the one that got the Secretary of State in Georgia to do all this crap?
[01:54:00.612 --> 01:54:02.934]  Well, he did there in Wisconsin just last week.
[01:54:02.974 --> 01:54:04.375]  I was talking to a lady there.
[01:54:04.856 --> 01:54:08.279]  She spoke in front of their Congress just last week.
[01:54:08.659 --> 01:54:16.567]  She filed a case against the state on these drop boxes, saying these things are unconstitutional.
[01:54:16.907 --> 01:54:18.749]  Again, there's no chain of custody, etc.
[01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:20.470]  And that case got thrown out.
[01:54:20.530 --> 01:54:23.233]  Now, here's the other thing, Alex, that people don't know about Wisconsin.
[01:54:23.633 --> 01:54:35.075]  Is that she found out during her case that there was the two leaders of the two Republican leaders, one in the Senate, one in the House, had given the okay to go ahead with this process.
[01:54:35.655 --> 01:54:42.676]  So we got a lot of Democrats that have infiltrated the Republican Party like Project Veritas caught in Texas and other states where the woman goes, I'm not really Republican.
[01:54:42.996 --> 01:54:43.797]  I oppose this one.
[01:54:43.857 --> 01:54:45.217]  I pay people to vote for Biden.
[01:54:45.697 --> 01:54:47.857]  And she's like giving them shirts and debit cards.
[01:54:47.917 --> 01:54:48.917]  Same thing with the Native Americans.
[01:54:49.277 --> 01:54:51.958]  I mean, this is just a giant exercise of criminal activity.
[01:54:52.785 --> 01:54:53.466]  Absolutely.
[01:54:53.506 --> 01:54:57.268]  It's been amazing to watch and so... Let me ask you this in closing.
[01:54:57.288 --> 01:54:58.048]  We really appreciate your time.
[01:54:58.088 --> 01:54:58.569]  I know you're busy.
[01:54:58.589 --> 01:55:01.450]  I want you to get back to the work you're doing that we followed at WePunch.com.
[01:55:02.071 --> 01:55:05.813]  What do you think Trump should do right now with 37 days out?
[01:55:06.233 --> 01:55:07.314]  And what do you think we can all do?
[01:55:08.476 --> 01:55:09.017]  Well, that's great.
[01:55:09.037 --> 01:55:22.017]  Well, first of all, we can and here's what we've been doing is putting up lists of these congressmen and women in these states and encouraging people to reach out to them and tell them how you feel, because this was a steal and we're not going to allow this to happen.
[01:55:22.097 --> 01:55:23.379]  Nobody's going to allow this to happen.
[01:55:23.895 --> 01:55:26.418]  You know, and it's just not going to happen.
[01:55:26.438 --> 01:55:27.098]  We all know that.
[01:55:27.158 --> 01:55:29.341]  It's just, we love this country.
[01:55:29.381 --> 01:55:30.862]  We love our freedom and we will fight.
[01:55:30.902 --> 01:55:31.262]  Exactly.
[01:55:31.282 --> 01:55:32.844]  You feel that same determination?
[01:55:32.884 --> 01:55:33.905]  We're not stopping.
[01:55:34.826 --> 01:55:36.007]  No, no way.
[01:55:36.387 --> 01:55:37.929]  And President Trump's not stopping.
[01:55:37.949 --> 01:55:41.933]  And he came up here the last few days and really fired off, saying, we're not stopping either.
[01:55:42.273 --> 01:55:51.380]  Now, Scott, as you know, I'm sure this executive order that's coming up here really is due by the 18th, if it hasn't been taken care of already.
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:56:05.590]  And the directive is that the DNI, who happens to be Radcliffe now, has to come out with a report, and he maybe already did, we don't know, and send it to the President that says whether there was any foreign interference in our election.
[01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:07.671]  And we know there was, Alex.
[01:56:07.691 --> 01:56:11.534]  Well, General Flynn just came out and said that in a speech Saturday, and we know China was involved.
[01:56:12.244 --> 01:56:12.944]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:56:12.964 --> 01:56:26.449]  And that case today in Michigan, the reason they were trying to stop that case is because of this incident and this information that these guys had, that information was flowing out of these machines and back into it.
[01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:29.270]  And so we don't know where it was going.
[01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:30.031]  Absolutely.
[01:56:30.071 --> 01:56:31.071]  And here's the good news though.
[01:56:31.977 --> 01:56:39.206]  But that's it so we know that another thing that we found a week ago is that there's this device on these Dominion voting machines.
[01:56:39.286 --> 01:56:43.572]  It's kind of like a remote modem type of access device.
[01:56:43.992 --> 01:56:48.398]  It's developed in France by a company that's wholly owned by a Chinese company.
[01:56:48.578 --> 01:56:48.638]  Yes.
[01:56:48.858 --> 01:56:51.860]  And that was attached to these Dominion machines.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:54.602]  And that's why you see the leak out of the CCP.
[01:56:54.982 --> 01:56:56.803]  I mean, Trump's still fighting harder than ever.
[01:56:56.823 --> 01:56:57.864]  I don't think people understand.
[01:56:58.204 --> 01:57:01.566]  We've got devastating evidence of Joe Biden being a Chai Com operative.
[01:57:01.586 --> 01:57:03.588]  So this is a huge time to be alive.
[01:57:03.788 --> 01:57:04.308]  That's it.
[01:57:04.388 --> 01:57:05.189]  And Swalwell.
[01:57:05.509 --> 01:57:07.830]  And why are these leaks coming out now about all this stuff?
[01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:09.411]  They didn't give a damn about it for how long.
[01:57:09.471 --> 01:57:10.412]  Now all of a sudden they're coming out.
[01:57:10.452 --> 01:57:11.773]  They're trying to soften this issue.
[01:57:12.033 --> 01:57:15.135]  Some people are saying they're trying to get rid of Biden and let Kamala Harris step in.
[01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:16.196]  I don't know.
[01:57:31.272 --> 01:57:32.292]  We are as well, but you really are.
[01:57:32.792 --> 01:57:37.274]  On China and what's about to break, if you just give us a five-minute briefing on... I totally agree.
[01:57:37.414 --> 01:57:38.174]  Everything is China.
[01:57:38.194 --> 01:57:38.494]  Thank you.
[01:57:38.854 --> 01:57:39.694]  Everything is China.
[01:57:39.754 --> 01:57:40.655]  Everything is Joe Biden.
[01:57:40.715 --> 01:57:42.435]  Even if he won, he's illegitimate.
[01:57:42.695 --> 01:57:46.136]  I mean, my God, we have all the proof they said they had on Trump, we have on him.
[01:57:46.316 --> 01:57:47.057]  Russia as well.
[01:57:47.457 --> 01:57:48.317]  Biden is a traitor.
[01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:02.110]  The globalists want you sick.
[01:58:02.911 --> 01:58:04.392]  They want you emasculated.
[01:58:04.492 --> 01:58:05.693]  They want you dehumanized.
[01:58:05.994 --> 01:58:07.095]  They want you dumbed down.
[01:58:07.615 --> 01:58:10.778]  They want you to be a weak, pathetic slave.
[01:58:11.438 --> 01:58:18.424]  And they start that control system by dumbing you down for birth and never letting you know the truth of what is unfolding.
[01:58:18.744 --> 01:58:20.226]  It is simply disgusting.
[01:58:20.906 --> 01:58:23.949]  Ever hear the establishment telling you that vitamin D3 is vital?
[01:58:23.989 --> 01:58:32.556]  You ever hear them explain to you that 40 plus percent of the public is vitamin D3 deficient and so many diseases and chronic problems are caused by it?
[01:58:32.576 --> 01:58:32.616]  No!
[01:58:32.736 --> 01:58:38.761]  Even though it's known scientific fact like gravity or the temperature at which water boils.
[01:58:39.081 --> 01:58:39.682]  These are facts.
[01:58:39.982 --> 01:58:40.603]  Well guess what?
[01:58:40.643 --> 01:58:43.165]  Winter Sun, after being sold out for months, is now back in stock.
[01:58:43.385 --> 01:58:47.128]  I didn't just get into the vitamin D3 game when it became so huge last year.
[01:58:47.228 --> 01:58:49.809]  We've been promoting it for more than 15 years with sponsors.
[01:58:49.949 --> 01:58:52.531]  Then about 8 years ago I started InfoWorks Life.
[01:58:52.651 --> 01:59:00.536]  I approached one of the top firms in the country and I said I want to sell the highest quality liquid vitamin D3 under the tongue because the science shows that's the best way to take it.
[01:59:00.576 --> 01:59:01.337]  They said absolutely.
[01:59:01.397 --> 01:59:06.482]  Then a few years ago, they pointed out, Vitamin K with D3 helps it upload in the cells even better.
[01:59:06.502 --> 01:59:07.302]  It's now available.
[01:59:07.403 --> 01:59:08.203]  Wear a sun plus.
[01:59:08.303 --> 01:59:11.166]  Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K at infomorestore.com.
[01:59:11.266 --> 01:59:12.027]  Sold out for months.

[01:59:14.189 --> 01:59:19.654]  Your friends, your family, your children, your neighbors, especially those that work inside all the time and don't get sun.
[01:59:19.754 --> 01:59:21.575]  Especially people with dark skin.
[01:59:21.736 --> 01:59:23.177]  You need more D3 than others.

[01:59:30.482 --> 01:59:31.543]  Vitamin D3 with K.

[01:59:36.447 --> 01:59:38.689]  Winter Sun, back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:59:53.609 --> 01:59:57.544]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:25.015 --> 02:00:25.776]  All right, we're back.
[02:00:27.378 --> 02:00:29.860]  We've got Ezra Levant joining us next segment.
[02:00:30.801 --> 02:00:32.062]  He did a four-year request.
[02:00:32.863 --> 02:00:34.945]  He's being harassed by Justin Trudeau.
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:37.821]  The guy that said the Great Reset's here.
[02:00:38.282 --> 02:00:41.104]  Let's get that clip ready next segment for the UN Takeover.
[02:00:42.045 --> 02:00:45.128]  And they got a bunch of documents that I guess they accidentally didn't redact.
[02:00:45.148 --> 02:00:46.249]  These documents were already public.
[02:00:46.730 --> 02:00:52.655]  But they got a bunch of documents, 30-something pages, about Chinese troops coming in to learn the secrets of the Canadian military.
[02:00:52.995 --> 02:00:58.420]  The Canadian military secretly blocked it, and Trudeau threw a temper tantrum because he's a Qaikom globalist.
[02:00:58.761 --> 02:01:00.683]  That's all coming up next segment.
[02:01:01.345 --> 02:01:05.249]  That ties into Swallow's Well and ties into Hunter Biden.
[02:01:05.269 --> 02:01:06.711]  In fact, get that Hunter Biden clip with him.
[02:01:07.071 --> 02:01:08.813]  I met with the top Chinese spy chief!
[02:01:08.833 --> 02:01:10.815]  I'm under criminal investigation!
[02:01:10.856 --> 02:01:11.616]  My daddy!
[02:01:11.636 --> 02:01:13.779]  My poppy poppy!
[02:01:15.839 --> 02:01:17.921]  Ezra Levant joining us next segment.
[02:01:17.941 --> 02:01:19.303]  Let's just play a few of these clips, though.
[02:01:19.623 --> 02:01:20.364]  They all go together.
[02:01:20.804 --> 02:01:23.667]  This is a New York lawmaker introduces a bill to make vaccine mandatory.
[02:01:23.928 --> 02:01:31.736]  Of course, they're not going to take it, so there's always loopholes, where if you have an allergy or illness or whatever, you don't have to, but they won't tell the public that, and it's all about fraud upon fraud.
[02:01:33.066 --> 02:01:35.747]  Violates the Nuremberg Code, Geneva Convention, you name it.
[02:01:36.007 --> 02:01:45.791]  And then let's play the clip of Carrie Mullis, the PCR inventor, who right before all this started said Fauci was a fraud, and they shouldn't be getting ready to use it, and then he mysteriously died.
[02:01:47.311 --> 02:01:53.033]  Another big whistleblower just died, who said she would never commit suicide if exposed Big Pharma and the vaccines.
[02:01:53.073 --> 02:01:57.655]  But let's play the local newscast, and then let's play this inventor of PCR tests.
[02:01:58.288 --> 02:02:04.312]  We've all been waiting for a vaccine because that is part of the solution to moving our lives ahead.
[02:02:04.652 --> 02:02:13.978]  And State Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal of the Upper West Side has introduced a bill requiring most New Yorkers get a COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:02:14.499 --> 02:02:22.344]  She says if at least 70% of the population does not get the vaccine on their own, then it should be mandatory.
[02:02:22.744 --> 02:02:28.148]  Then the State Department of Health would have the ability to say that more people have to get it.
[02:02:28.428 --> 02:02:31.030]  And they would set the rules and they would set the structure.
[02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:36.794]  Labor and employment lawyer Helen Rella says your boss could force you to get a COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:02:36.834 --> 02:02:37.835]  Okay, so let's stop right there.
[02:02:38.896 --> 02:02:40.397]  This is literally tyranny.
[02:02:40.757 --> 02:02:42.018]  It's linked to sterilization.
[02:02:42.539 --> 02:02:43.600]  This is 1984.
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:44.660]  This is Nazi Germany.
[02:02:44.961 --> 02:02:45.641]  This isn't a drill.
[02:02:45.661 --> 02:02:46.181]  It isn't a game.
[02:02:46.822 --> 02:02:48.623]  Notice he said, before we can move forward.
[02:02:48.763 --> 02:02:50.064]  They're going to keep everything locked down.
[02:02:51.058 --> 02:02:58.902]  And then say, oh, sorry, we can't open things because there's still COVID cases, which they make up by turning up the test, and then they never let you go.
[02:02:58.922 --> 02:03:05.686]  Then they blame those of us that don't submit to them to why they kept things locked down to vertically integrate with the Great Reset and take over.
[02:03:05.986 --> 02:03:09.848]  Here's the inventor of the PCR test that they obviously killed right before all this came out.
[02:03:12.011 --> 02:03:18.553]  What is it about humanity that wants to go to all the details and stuff and listen?
[02:03:18.593 --> 02:03:21.094]  You know, these guys like Fauci get up there and start talking.
[02:03:21.134 --> 02:03:23.315]  You know, he doesn't know anything, really, about anything.
[02:03:23.355 --> 02:03:24.795]  And I'd say that to his face.
[02:03:25.675 --> 02:03:26.036]  Nothing.
[02:03:26.656 --> 02:03:32.158]  The man thinks he can take a blood sample and stick it in an electron microscope and if it's got a virus in there, you'll know it.
[02:03:33.098 --> 02:03:35.099]  He doesn't understand electron microscopy.
[02:03:35.119 --> 02:03:36.819]  He doesn't understand medicine.
[02:03:36.839 --> 02:03:39.120]  He should not be in a position like he's in.
[02:03:40.208 --> 02:03:46.490]  Most of those guys up there on the top are just total administrative people and they don't know anything about what's going on on the bottom.
[02:03:46.770 --> 02:03:55.833]  You know, those guys have got an agenda, which is not what we would like them to have, being that we pay for them to take care of our health and so on.
[02:03:56.353 --> 02:03:58.534]  They've got a personal kind of agenda.
[02:03:59.054 --> 02:04:08.537]  They make up their own rules as they go, they change them when they want to, and they smugly, like Tony Fauci, does not mind going on television in front of the people who pay his salary and lie directly into the camera.
[02:04:09.847 --> 02:04:14.269]  You can't expect the sheep to really respect the best and the brightest.
[02:04:14.309 --> 02:04:16.309]  They don't know the difference, really.
[02:04:16.329 --> 02:04:32.315]  I mean, I like humans, don't get me wrong, but basically, there's a vast majority of them do not possess the ability to judge who is and who isn't a really good scientist.
[02:04:32.935 --> 02:04:33.776]  I mean, that's a problem.
[02:04:33.836 --> 02:04:37.137]  That's a main problem, actually, with science, I'd say, in this century, because
[02:04:38.104 --> 02:04:40.125]  Science is being judged by people.
[02:04:40.745 --> 02:04:43.707]  Funding is being done by people who don't understand it.
[02:04:43.727 --> 02:04:44.207]  Okay?
[02:04:44.247 --> 02:04:44.827]  Who do we trust?
[02:04:44.847 --> 02:04:45.448]  Fauci.
[02:04:45.608 --> 02:04:54.532]  Fauci didn't know enough to, you know... If Fauci wants to get on television with somebody who knows a little bit about this stuff and debate him, he could easily do it, because he's been asked.
[02:04:55.593 --> 02:05:00.235]  I mean, I've had a lot of people... And then we're gonna add and post the clip I want.
[02:05:00.768 --> 02:05:04.230]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[02:05:04.530 --> 02:05:08.533]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[02:05:08.853 --> 02:05:17.399]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:17.719 --> 02:05:34.011]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[02:05:34.332 --> 02:05:40.156]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate
[02:05:40.336 --> 02:05:40.856]  We're good to go.
[02:06:20.526 --> 02:06:24.149]  We are now into our number two broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:24.269 --> 02:06:25.570]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.411 --> 02:06:32.736]  And the quickening is here, the alignment of the political, cultural, spiritual, economic planets is upon us.
[02:06:33.296 --> 02:06:34.958]  Wow, China, China, China.
[02:06:35.198 --> 02:06:36.239]  You know, we heard about Trump.
[02:06:36.279 --> 02:06:39.141]  He was this Russian agent and hookers were in St.
[02:06:39.181 --> 02:06:41.063]  Petersburg pissing in his face.
[02:06:41.823 --> 02:06:42.784]  And none of it was true.
[02:06:43.044 --> 02:06:43.825]  It was all fake.
[02:06:43.905 --> 02:06:44.466]  It came out.
[02:06:45.686 --> 02:06:48.569]  The writer of the dossier, Steele, admitted it was not true.
[02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:56.154]  It was all funded by Hillary Clinton and other deep state operatives like George Herbert Walker Bush's son, Jeb Bush.
[02:06:57.715 --> 02:07:03.920]  But when it comes to China and the Bidens and the Clintons, my goodness, it swallows well.
[02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:10.325]  And Dianne Feinstein, her main assistant being the Chinese communist agent,
[02:07:11.437 --> 02:07:21.084]  And we've got Biden saying every aspect of American life should be run by the Communist Chinese.
[02:07:21.124 --> 02:07:32.773]  And his son, we'll play the clip coming up next segment, saying that I met with the head of Communist Chinese intelligence and now the FBI is investigating me and my dad and they gave me billions of dollars.
[02:07:32.853 --> 02:07:34.574]  It's all recorded.
[02:07:35.015 --> 02:07:35.935]  It's all real.
[02:07:36.275 --> 02:07:39.438]  It's all smoking gun, just like the election fraud.
[02:07:40.663 --> 02:07:45.928]  And then you add this giant 500 ton cherry.
[02:07:47.369 --> 02:07:49.331]  Chinese military sends troops to Canada.
[02:07:49.371 --> 02:07:51.873]  PLA training with Canadian forces.
[02:07:51.933 --> 02:07:52.674]  Documents show.
[02:07:53.074 --> 02:07:58.999]  And when the military said they're stealing our secrets and kicked them out or cancelled it, Trudeau freaked out.
[02:07:59.239 --> 02:08:00.160]  Explosive documents.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.363]  Canadian Prime Minister requested Chinese troops be stationed in Canada.
[02:08:03.883 --> 02:08:05.064]  That is from the rebel
[02:08:05.845 --> 02:08:08.887]  News.com, secret military documents.
[02:08:08.927 --> 02:08:12.269]  Trudeau invited Chinese troops to train at Canadian military bases.
[02:08:12.689 --> 02:08:15.711]  And the left will spin it, the 30-plus pages of secret documents.
[02:08:15.931 --> 02:08:16.792]  They're like, oh, big deal.
[02:08:17.152 --> 02:08:19.534]  Oh, really, the military said it was a national security breach.
[02:08:19.794 --> 02:08:21.375]  The military said it shouldn't happen.
[02:08:21.835 --> 02:08:24.217]  And Trudeau blew up and said, I am the Prime Minister.
[02:08:24.637 --> 02:08:27.079]  You will do what I say.
[02:08:27.739 --> 02:08:28.840]  So this is simply
[02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:31.669]  Incredible, because they're not just stealing your secrets.
[02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:33.010]  They're offering you money.
[02:08:33.250 --> 02:08:34.070]  They're buying you off.
[02:08:34.290 --> 02:08:42.192]  Every Chinese businessman that's part of the party, or under the party, and every member of the Chinese military is an asset, is an agent.
[02:08:42.512 --> 02:08:42.972]  In the U.S.
[02:08:43.012 --> 02:08:45.773]  military, 99% of people are not a spy.
[02:08:46.373 --> 02:08:46.833]  Or less.
[02:08:46.873 --> 02:08:48.814]  I bet out of 5,000 people in the U.S.
[02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:52.475]  military, Air Force, Army, Marines, none of them are spies, okay?
[02:08:52.795 --> 02:08:56.096]  Even if you're in PSYOPs, very few are operational in the field, okay?
[02:08:57.694 --> 02:09:00.857]  But if you were in Nazi Germany, a lot of you were.
[02:09:00.957 --> 02:09:04.280]  Or if you're in an authoritarian Soviet system, a third of your people are.
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:07.283]  Same thing with the Chaikoms.
[02:09:07.303 --> 02:09:17.532]  So Ezra Levant of Rebel Media, a major journalist, you can hear him tell you how he got these unredacted documents that no one else ever got, and just what this means and how big this is.
[02:09:17.792 --> 02:09:20.855]  I mean, I thought the last thing he broke was Trudeau saying,
[02:09:21.135 --> 02:09:23.478]  We're in the global reset for the New World Order.
[02:09:23.738 --> 02:09:24.840]  The UN will run everything.
[02:09:25.381 --> 02:09:27.884]  That was public, but Ezra found it and made it popular.
[02:09:28.545 --> 02:09:29.606]  That's really what's important.
[02:09:29.706 --> 02:09:34.032]  And now, I thought that was the biggest Trudeau traitorous faux pas.
[02:09:34.273 --> 02:09:37.156]  So Ezra, tell us about the Providence, where this is going.
[02:09:37.697 --> 02:09:38.758]  Sure Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:09:38.778 --> 02:09:42.341]  This is the biggest story I've ever covered in my life.
[02:10:08.104 --> 02:10:12.586]  I will never have a story this big, this important, this dramatic again.
[02:10:12.966 --> 02:10:14.106]  And it's incredible.
[02:10:14.906 --> 02:10:32.392]  And it started a year and a half ago when I saw a little snippet reported on a Russian state broadcaster called Sputnik that Canada had sent a delegation to participate in China's Navy 70th anniversary celebration.
[02:10:32.432 --> 02:10:33.713]  I thought, why is Canada
[02:10:34.572 --> 02:10:38.737]  Celebrating the 70th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army-Navy.
[02:10:38.757 --> 02:10:41.740]  And I don't know if you know this, Alex, but just a few months before that...
[02:10:42.469 --> 02:10:47.473]  China grabbed two Canadian civilians off the streets and has held them hostage ever since.
[02:10:47.833 --> 02:10:57.700]  So it's gross that a NATO member and a NORAD member like Canada would celebrate the People's Liberation Army celebration at all.
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:01.263]  But this was just months after China kidnapped two Canadians.
[02:11:01.683 --> 02:11:04.845]  So I saw news of this nowhere else other than on this Russian site.
[02:11:05.205 --> 02:11:08.808]  I did what's called an access to information request, a freedom of information request.
[02:11:09.415 --> 02:11:13.638]  They delayed 19 months, but they finally answered.
[02:11:14.259 --> 02:11:26.829]  And yes, they confirmed that Trudeau sent someone to celebrate the Chinese Navy, but that was the least of it, because they sent 34 pages of internal documents that I never actually even asked for.
[02:11:28.050 --> 02:11:34.115]  And instead of blacking them out, as secret documents usually are, they only grade them out.
[02:11:34.155 --> 02:11:36.637]  You can read every single word.
[02:11:37.426 --> 02:11:40.127]  And I put them up on the internet at thechinafiles.com.
[02:11:40.147 --> 02:11:40.767]  You can take a look.
[02:11:41.027 --> 02:11:44.189]  But let me just tell you the craziest thing in there.
[02:11:44.249 --> 02:11:47.030]  I did not know any of this and I like to think I follow the news closely.
[02:11:49.031 --> 02:11:53.592]  In 2019, there were not one, not two, not five, not ten.
[02:11:53.893 --> 02:12:01.435]  There were 18 exchanges between the Canadian Armed Forces and the People's Liberation Army. 18!
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:18.429]  Where we were sending our Canadian troops to China, where China was sending their troops here, and you're correct, one of them, the cold weather training at CFB Borden, our Canadian forces base, sorry, Petawawa in Ontario.
[02:12:18.610 --> 02:12:22.512]  There's a Canadian forces base in Ontario, specialists in cold weather warfare.
[02:12:23.833 --> 02:12:25.654]  Our Canadian military cancelled that.
[02:12:26.261 --> 02:12:30.542]  As soon as Trudeau heard that the military cancelled that, he raged at them.
[02:12:30.582 --> 02:12:36.743]  He sent a memo to them saying, never cancel a partnership with China again without my permission.
[02:12:37.203 --> 02:12:43.445]  And on this cancellation, we have to work with you on crafting the language so the Chinese don't lose face.
[02:12:44.005 --> 02:12:50.246]  So yes, we believe that cold weather warfare training was eventually cancelled by the military.
[02:12:50.266 --> 02:12:51.706]  They got hell for it from Trudeau.
[02:12:52.327 --> 02:12:53.847]  But the real news here,
[02:12:54.562 --> 02:13:05.810]  Is that there were 17 other military exchanges, including Chinese one-star and two-star generals, coming to Canada to study in our war colleges.
[02:13:06.191 --> 02:13:11.294]  If you go to these documents, the most interesting pages are the last two pages.
[02:13:11.555 --> 02:13:13.516]  I see you're scrolling them on your screen right now.
[02:13:13.936 --> 02:13:19.380]  Go to the last two pages, you'll see a list of all 18 exchanges.
[02:13:19.621 --> 02:13:21.222]  I gotta throw one more thing at you, Alex.
[02:13:22.398 --> 02:13:32.901]  In October of 2019, in the city of Wuhan, maybe you've heard of it, that China held the Military World Games.
[02:13:33.321 --> 02:13:34.782]  It's like the Olympics for soldiers.
[02:13:35.042 --> 02:13:36.802]  Huge propaganda coup for China.
[02:13:37.682 --> 02:13:45.005]  Canada sent nearly 200 Canadian Armed Forces personnel for nine days to Wuhan.
[02:13:45.565 --> 02:13:47.005]  Now you got your questions about the virus?
[02:13:47.045 --> 02:13:47.965]  Let's put those aside.
[02:13:48.406 --> 02:13:49.426]  You got the propaganda
[02:13:50.879 --> 02:13:52.841]  Bonanza for China, let's put that aside.
[02:13:53.582 --> 02:14:06.234]  Why on earth would you send 200 physically fit young men and women, most of them single, for nine days to China, where they'll be wined and dined and wooed, Swalwell style?
[02:14:07.375 --> 02:14:11.839]  At the very least, China will know a lot more about those 200 soldiers forever.
[02:14:12.668 --> 02:14:17.491]  And at most, maybe one or two of them will be turned, extorted, entrapped in a honey trap.
[02:14:17.972 --> 02:14:19.053]  Who sends 200 young soldiers?
[02:14:19.073 --> 02:14:20.554]  Sure, you would never send regular soldiers.
[02:14:20.594 --> 02:14:23.456]  You would only send spies to infiltrate them.
[02:14:23.476 --> 02:14:27.779]  That's why they always have the joke, James Bond having sex with the other operatives, because both sides are spying.
[02:14:27.999 --> 02:14:30.260]  You don't send regular troops into a situation like that.
[02:14:31.361 --> 02:14:32.082]  Well, and that's the thing.
[02:14:32.162 --> 02:14:35.204]  On the Canadian side, when we were getting these people coming to Canada,
[02:14:35.794 --> 02:14:36.935]  To study our systems.
[02:14:37.135 --> 02:14:38.756]  They're not sending regular GIs.
[02:14:39.176 --> 02:14:41.918]  They're sending probably people with photographic memory.
[02:14:42.298 --> 02:14:49.942]  People who have studied our systems and are actually just trying to crack our codes and processes and strategies.
[02:14:50.483 --> 02:14:52.564]  The crazy thing is we're inviting them in.
[02:14:53.164 --> 02:14:54.405]  We're sponsoring them.
[02:14:54.645 --> 02:14:58.067]  We're letting them wander around on our military bases without a minder.
[02:14:58.487 --> 02:15:02.330]  And this is all from Canada, which is your best friend and ally.
[02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:03.150]  What the hell are we doing?
[02:15:03.530 --> 02:15:04.351]  So here's the thing.
[02:15:05.126 --> 02:15:12.633]  When we cancelled the cold weather warfare exercise with China, and this is right there in the documents, this is why these documents are so incredible.
[02:15:13.334 --> 02:15:20.600]  34 pages, unredacted, secret military, they're marked secret, some of them are marked Canadian eyes only.
[02:15:22.002 --> 02:15:29.769]  So when our soldiers said, no, no, we've got to cancel this military winter warfare training, the Prime Minister said, why?
[02:15:30.965 --> 02:15:35.667]  And so the military said, well, you know, knowledge transfer, and we've had complaints from allies.
[02:15:36.107 --> 02:15:37.448]  And you can see this email exchange.
[02:15:37.488 --> 02:15:38.468]  You can see what this is all about.
[02:15:38.488 --> 02:15:39.028]  Stay right there.
[02:15:39.068 --> 02:15:42.309]  And I also want to ask, you did a foyer for one thing, not something else.
[02:15:42.610 --> 02:15:48.252]  I think it's pretty safe to say this is a rebellion against reason, against Trudeau, that they leaked you classified stuff.
[02:15:48.272 --> 02:15:51.653]  That's why it's in gray, because if that ever got classified, they recommended it be blacked out.
[02:15:51.953 --> 02:15:53.434]  You were given a secret document.
[02:15:53.454 --> 02:15:56.915]  The only area it's blacked out, you decided to do so to protect the innocent.
[02:15:56.935 --> 02:15:57.996]  This is huge, folks.
[02:15:58.016 --> 02:15:58.716]  Be right back.
[02:16:02.231 --> 02:16:07.772]  2020 was supposed to be a banner year, a year now defined by a global pandemic.
[02:16:08.613 --> 02:16:11.854]  The NBA is suspending the season.
[02:16:11.874 --> 02:16:17.795]  MLB spring training, NHL regular season, March Madness cancelled.
[02:16:17.815 --> 02:16:21.136]  It will forever be known as the day sports shut down.
[02:16:22.656 --> 02:16:28.118]  While sports across the globe go dark, Dana White says the show will go on for UFC.
[02:16:30.751 --> 02:16:33.054]  Why is Dana White comfortable continuing?
[02:16:33.414 --> 02:16:36.938]  Dana White is somebody with a flawed intelligence.
[02:16:37.359 --> 02:16:38.881]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[02:16:41.451 --> 02:16:44.112]  More doubts this should even be attempted.
[02:16:44.272 --> 02:16:45.972]  There's still a medical danger here.
[02:16:46.233 --> 02:16:49.114]  Really negligent decision-making to make a buck.
[02:16:49.154 --> 02:16:51.794]  There was an article in the New York Times today that was very critical.
[02:16:51.974 --> 02:16:54.535]  I don't give a f**k. It seems dangerous.
[02:16:54.555 --> 02:16:55.216]  It seems foolish.
[02:16:55.236 --> 02:16:57.076]  They're doing it to make a sporting event safe.
[02:16:57.136 --> 02:16:59.977]  There's no way to 100% guarantee the safety of everybody.
[02:17:00.337 --> 02:17:01.718]  We don't dictate the timeline.
[02:17:01.758 --> 02:17:03.958]  The virus is the one in charge here.
[02:17:03.978 --> 02:17:05.719]  This isn't something that should be happening.
[02:17:06.239 --> 02:17:08.221]  So many risks involved in this.
[02:17:08.801 --> 02:17:12.625]  There's no way they come out of this completely unscathed.
[02:17:12.645 --> 02:17:15.327]  This whole damn idea is reckless!
[02:17:15.687 --> 02:17:17.448]  Dana White's legacy, pay me.
[02:17:17.829 --> 02:17:21.852]  Even if I put you in serious and potentially fatal harm.
[02:17:22.312 --> 02:17:28.317]  Lining your pockets with money is more important than the safety of the production staff and the people you have fighting for you.
[02:17:28.477 --> 02:17:32.781]  You can't make it totally safe and it's all fun and games until someone gets this thing.
[02:17:32.941 --> 02:17:33.982]  You're not listening.
[02:17:34.002 --> 02:17:34.963]  It is purely green.
[02:17:35.103 --> 02:17:39.948]  This is totally negative for mixed martial arts and the UFC and I'm not sure it's one that they'll get over for a while.
[02:17:39.968 --> 02:17:41.369]  It is way off, way wrong.
[02:17:42.090 --> 02:17:45.733]  The virus forced businesses across the country to close their doors.
[02:17:45.793 --> 02:17:49.076]  The global fear of COVID-19 as cases around the world continue to grow.
[02:17:52.574 --> 02:17:53.735]  I'm not afraid of the media.
[02:17:54.415 --> 02:17:56.257]  Why should anyone listen to the media?
[02:17:56.757 --> 02:17:57.818]  Who are these people?
[02:17:58.118 --> 02:17:59.099]  What makes them experts?
[02:17:59.159 --> 02:18:00.720]  What have they ever accomplished?
[02:18:01.461 --> 02:18:09.286]  They criticize me for even trying to find a way forward because it's easy to criticize from the sidelines when you risk nothing and do nothing.
[02:18:09.847 --> 02:18:11.248]  But we need to fight this thing.
[02:18:11.288 --> 02:18:13.890]  Instead of panicking, let's find solutions.
[02:18:14.510 --> 02:18:17.873]  Is it feasible that UFC could go off in a month?
[02:18:18.553 --> 02:18:19.134]  I don't see how.
[02:18:20.216 --> 02:18:23.059]  Three fight cards have been announced in Jacksonville.
[02:18:23.279 --> 02:18:25.100]  On our way to Jacksonville, baby.
[02:18:25.541 --> 02:18:29.845]  If the UFC or any of these organizations want to go to Florida, that's a recipe for disaster.
[02:18:30.245 --> 02:18:33.588]  I've also secured an island.
[02:18:33.628 --> 02:18:39.854]  We're going to do all of our international fights on this island.
[02:18:45.518 --> 02:18:48.243]  Dana White devised an insane workaround.
[02:18:48.483 --> 02:18:53.452]  The UFC is apparently building a facility on a private island that they're calling Fight Island.
[02:18:53.632 --> 02:18:54.994]  It's such a stupid idea.
[02:18:55.014 --> 02:18:55.876]  I don't really have any...
[02:19:06.823 --> 02:19:10.265]  Everything above and beyond to make sure that everybody is safe.
[02:19:10.285 --> 02:19:14.367]  Even if you believe they're taking all the precautions, it's still a very high risk scenario.
[02:19:14.407 --> 02:19:18.129]  There's just no way to completely eliminate the risk that someone could get sick.
[02:19:18.630 --> 02:19:20.471]  The media are not in the news business.
[02:19:20.551 --> 02:19:22.552]  They're in the clickbait business.
[02:19:22.592 --> 02:19:25.314]  They think negativity sells and gets clicks.
[02:19:25.714 --> 02:19:27.255]  So that's what they deliver.
[02:19:27.335 --> 02:19:29.396]  Negativity is their product.
[02:19:29.416 --> 02:19:30.917]  But I'm not gonna let that stop me.
[02:19:31.557 --> 02:19:35.358]  Anytime there's great success, it's surrounded by negativity.
[02:19:35.679 --> 02:19:36.759]  But here's the reality.
[02:19:36.779 --> 02:19:38.980]  None of the media people know anything about this business.
[02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:51.384]  A lot of people did not want this to happen.
[02:19:51.424 --> 02:19:55.846]  But what we're really good at, is proving people wrong.
[02:20:02.478 --> 02:20:06.582]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:07.102 --> 02:20:08.423]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:22.335 --> 02:20:26.519]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:20:27.239 --> 02:20:28.681]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:29.790 --> 02:20:32.997]  Well, this is a hundred times crazier than a Tom Clancy novel.
[02:20:33.438 --> 02:20:36.224]  We have the co-author with Tom Clancy, Dr. Stephen Kinnick, joining us next hour.
[02:20:37.607 --> 02:20:38.529]  This is the real world.
[02:20:40.470 --> 02:20:43.612]  And I've been interviewing Ezra Vant for probably six, seven years.
[02:20:43.672 --> 02:20:45.033]  I've known who he is for over a decade.
[02:20:45.233 --> 02:20:47.734]  The guy's a great journalist, an amazing person.
[02:20:47.794 --> 02:20:49.756]  I sleep good at night knowing he's out there, literally.
[02:20:50.176 --> 02:20:53.798]  You know, most guests, I don't have those type of platitudes, but he really kicks ass.
[02:20:54.138 --> 02:21:03.644]  To have him say this is the biggest thing he's ever broke, because it exposes all this clandestine training no one knew about, and the military's saying we're concerned, and allies are concerned, and Trudeau flipping out.
[02:21:04.344 --> 02:21:05.765]  Like the little globalist he is.
[02:21:05.785 --> 02:21:08.667]  I mean, Ezra, when you say this is huge, this is seismic.
[02:21:09.007 --> 02:21:11.329]  You were getting to a big point, though, when you got cut off by the break.
[02:21:12.390 --> 02:21:12.850]  No problem.
[02:21:12.890 --> 02:21:17.913]  Listen, I want to tell you, you know, in my own way, this was my bohemian grove.
[02:21:17.973 --> 02:21:23.577]  When you went there and saw with your eyes what you always sensed, then you knew you were on the right track.
[02:21:23.657 --> 02:21:25.078]  It confirmed your suspicions.
[02:21:25.359 --> 02:21:25.979]  Same thing here.
[02:21:26.740 --> 02:21:31.583]  I did not know how pervasive the anti-American nature
[02:21:32.478 --> 02:21:35.523]  Of our bureaucracy was and the pro-China nature.
[02:21:35.823 --> 02:21:44.857]  See, we knew that Justin Trudeau, like his father Pierre Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada a generation ago, we knew he had a soft spot for communist regimes.
[02:21:45.378 --> 02:21:46.760]  The Trudeaus loved Castro.
[02:21:47.409 --> 02:21:52.332]  Pierre Trudeau went to the Soviet Union on a holiday, said Siberia was the land of the future.
[02:21:52.372 --> 02:21:59.837]  So we knew that the Trudeau family had a soft spot for tyranny, but we did not know how deep it went into the bureaucracy.
[02:22:00.137 --> 02:22:01.398]  Can I play for you a clip?
[02:22:01.478 --> 02:22:02.399]  I sent it to your producer.
[02:22:02.859 --> 02:22:10.364]  When Trudeau was running, before he was Prime Minister, he was asked a question at a fundraiser that he wasn't prepared for, it wasn't scripted.
[02:22:10.664 --> 02:22:11.985]  So he actually answered from the heart.
[02:22:13.143 --> 02:22:17.464]  He was asked, what country in the world do you most admire?
[02:22:18.884 --> 02:22:22.145]  Listen to what he says and his explanation for it.
[02:22:22.165 --> 02:22:22.925]  I think you've got the clip.
[02:22:22.945 --> 02:22:23.445]  Take a listen.
[02:22:23.665 --> 02:22:24.126]  Here it is.
[02:22:24.746 --> 02:22:28.487]  ...of admiration I actually have for China.
[02:22:30.627 --> 02:22:38.209]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime.
[02:22:39.147 --> 02:22:39.507]  Wow!
[02:22:39.607 --> 02:22:40.528]  Dictatorship!
[02:22:40.608 --> 02:22:47.013]  Not the fact that they have hundreds of millions of slaves and that we've cut our market down and given it to them with one-sided deals.
[02:22:47.113 --> 02:22:47.333]  Wow!
[02:22:47.374 --> 02:22:48.815]  That is... I forgot that clip.
[02:22:49.155 --> 02:22:50.576]  That is a profound statement.
[02:22:51.657 --> 02:22:54.399]  Well, I mean, I admire many things about China too.
[02:22:54.459 --> 02:23:01.485]  I admire their history, their intelligence, their culture, their language, their food.
[02:23:01.705 --> 02:23:03.366]  There's many things to admire about China.
[02:23:03.967 --> 02:23:05.628]  But what was the one thing he named?
[02:23:06.522 --> 02:23:08.182]  They're basic dictatorship.
[02:23:08.522 --> 02:23:10.003]  That's the one thing he liked.
[02:23:10.023 --> 02:23:11.283]  That's the one thing I hate about them.
[02:23:11.623 --> 02:23:12.823]  That's the one thing they love about them.
[02:23:13.244 --> 02:23:17.564]  And so I thought, well, maybe that was a flourish, an off-script comment.
[02:23:17.764 --> 02:23:18.285]  But look at this.
[02:23:18.325 --> 02:23:19.265]  I sent you one more clip.
[02:23:19.545 --> 02:23:28.867]  This was Trudeau's hand-picked ambassador from Canada to China during the events we've been talking about, the exchanges,
[02:23:30.288 --> 02:23:32.713]  Between the People's Liberation and the Canadian Armed Forces.
[02:23:32.813 --> 02:23:39.467]  Listen to Trudeau's ambassador talk about what his marching orders were to China.
[02:23:39.487 --> 02:23:39.928]  Take a listen.
[02:23:41.096 --> 02:23:55.474]  In 24 hours of arriving in China, I was invited to present my credentials to President Xi Jinping, and I conveyed to him a message from our Prime Minister that can be summarized in three words, more, more, more.
[02:23:55.494 --> 02:23:59.379]  Or in Mandarin, gung-dua, gung-dua, gung-dua.
[02:24:00.871 --> 02:24:09.678]  So this is a total capitulation to a government that admits they've killed over 100 million of their own people, that does secret experimentation, that has millions in death camps.
[02:24:10.239 --> 02:24:15.623]  I mean, there's not much stuff worse than Hitler or Stalin, but they seem to have found it and they're in love with it.
[02:24:15.883 --> 02:24:18.045]  And this is Trudeau pledging allegiance to it.
[02:24:19.426 --> 02:24:26.430]  And the thing is, I thought maybe these were just expressions of enthusiasm for public consumption.
[02:24:26.810 --> 02:24:27.311]  No, no, no.
[02:24:27.751 --> 02:24:37.917]  These 34 pages of unredacted secret military documents show that this is being pushed through the entire foreign affairs apparatus of Canada.
[02:24:38.357 --> 02:24:40.198]  And what's so crazy to me is
[02:24:41.024 --> 02:24:42.885]  Canada and the United States are the closest friends.
[02:24:42.925 --> 02:24:45.526]  We share the world's largest undefended border.
[02:24:45.866 --> 02:24:47.106]  Culturally, we're very similar.
[02:24:47.166 --> 02:24:48.387]  Historically, very similar.
[02:24:48.747 --> 02:24:50.728]  We fought in World War I and II together.
[02:24:50.808 --> 02:24:52.308]  We fought in Korea together.
[02:24:53.669 --> 02:24:55.069]  So many friendships.
[02:24:55.609 --> 02:24:56.610]  So many commonalities.
[02:24:57.170 --> 02:24:58.510]  You're our greatest friend and ally.
[02:24:58.770 --> 02:25:05.693]  And, frankly, your military has subsidized our way of life because you defend the entire continent.
[02:25:06.353 --> 02:25:08.594]  And to watch these bureaucrats
[02:25:09.789 --> 02:25:14.050]  Suck up to China and disparage the Trump administration.
[02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:26.572]  Because when the general, the chief of the defense staff in Canada, said he wanted to cancel this winter warfare training, the prime minister's office and his staff said, who was it who ratted this out?
[02:25:26.692 --> 02:25:27.813]  Who objected?
[02:25:28.693 --> 02:25:31.593]  And the army said, well, our allies, sir.
[02:25:32.414 --> 02:25:33.094]  Who was it?
[02:25:33.514 --> 02:25:34.354]  Was it Trump?
[02:25:35.225 --> 02:25:42.010]  Because it was as if Trudeau was saying if the Australians or the New Zealanders or the Brits objected, okay, fine.
[02:25:42.030 --> 02:25:46.153]  But they specifically call out, quote, the Trump administration.
[02:25:47.554 --> 02:25:53.299]  And I say to you, Alex, every letter sent by the Prime Minister's side in this internal battle,
[02:25:54.068 --> 02:25:57.329]  Could have been written by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
[02:25:57.709 --> 02:26:00.290]  It was so anti-American and pro-China.
[02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:01.131]  Oh, we know what happens.
[02:26:01.171 --> 02:26:03.492]  The globalists use communist China as a base.
[02:26:03.832 --> 02:26:06.173]  They give them most favored status.
[02:26:06.193 --> 02:26:09.554]  They set it up where they can operate however they want, so that no one can compete with them.
[02:26:09.574 --> 02:26:14.216]  They put environmental rules on us, including Canadians, where we can't compete, so all our jobs go there.
[02:26:14.496 --> 02:26:19.618]  And then the bureaucrats sit there and basically sell us out even further for money and for funding.
[02:26:19.658 --> 02:26:21.018]  And now they're great reset.
[02:26:21.098 --> 02:26:22.279]  China's open for business.
[02:26:22.739 --> 02:26:23.779]  Building back better.
[02:26:52.148 --> 02:27:00.395]  means getting support to the most vulnerable while maintaining our momentum on reaching the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.
[02:27:01.296 --> 02:27:03.638]  Canada is here to listen and to help.
[02:27:04.139 --> 02:27:07.722]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.
[02:27:08.102 --> 02:27:18.932]  This is our chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty, inequality and climate change.
[02:27:20.128 --> 02:27:24.352]  Which are all buzzwords for power grabs, central government, shut us down, leave China open.
[02:27:24.733 --> 02:27:25.734]  Ezra, incredible.
[02:27:26.234 --> 02:27:27.856]  This story I know has gone mega viral.
[02:27:28.397 --> 02:27:29.578]  Where do you think it goes from here?
[02:27:31.112 --> 02:27:32.553]  Well, I mean, that's the crazy thing.
[02:27:32.573 --> 02:27:42.978]  I listened to a press conference on Parliament Hill in Canada today, where the Conservative leader of the opposition said, I'm going to have a press conference to talk about these documents.
[02:27:43.459 --> 02:27:45.620]  So all the mainstream media were there.
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.101]  You had the CBC state broadcaster.
[02:27:48.341 --> 02:27:49.722]  You had the big wire services.
[02:27:50.082 --> 02:27:51.863]  Six questions and follow-ups were asked.
[02:27:52.363 --> 02:27:55.485]  Not one were about these documents.
[02:27:55.945 --> 02:27:58.986]  We have published these documents for the world to see.
[02:27:59.466 --> 02:28:02.167]  I invite any media to use them.
[02:28:02.207 --> 02:28:06.049]  There's a wealth of material in there that would take weeks to unpack.
[02:28:06.369 --> 02:28:16.352]  Not one question, because the media party, as I call it, is absolutely in sync with the political, industrial, military security complex.
[02:28:16.872 --> 02:28:18.533]  And they... I mean, you would think...
[02:28:19.187 --> 02:28:21.929]  The word secret would make them curious.
[02:28:22.609 --> 02:28:28.673]  And this was a press conference specifically about the documents, not one question about the documents.
[02:28:28.933 --> 02:28:31.614]  It's like it never happened, but I promise you it did.
[02:28:31.654 --> 02:28:32.835]  Let me throw one more thing at you.
[02:28:33.973 --> 02:28:34.893]  Hold on, we've got to go to break.
[02:28:34.913 --> 02:28:35.953]  Tell us this on the other side.
[02:28:36.233 --> 02:28:38.574]  Plus, I would expect, this is already so big in the U.S.
[02:28:38.634 --> 02:28:40.254]  media, Trump's going to cover it.
[02:28:40.614 --> 02:28:42.675]  Throw us into the next big thing we're going to cover.
[02:28:43.035 --> 02:28:44.495]  Ezra Levant is our guest.
[02:28:44.615 --> 02:28:50.776]  Read the exclusive documents and information on his extremely important website, rebelnews.com.
[02:28:51.196 --> 02:28:53.636]  It's right there on the front page, rebelnews.com.
[02:28:54.016 --> 02:28:57.817]  We, of course, have it all linked up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:28:57.837 --> 02:28:58.397]  Stay with us.
[02:29:00.518 --> 02:29:02.158]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[02:29:02.198 --> 02:29:02.758]  Thank you for holding.
[02:29:03.598 --> 02:29:04.338]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:29:05.099 --> 02:29:06.500]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:07.741]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[02:29:07.761 --> 02:29:08.081]  How are you?
[02:29:08.481 --> 02:29:09.161]  I love you, man.
[02:29:09.261 --> 02:29:11.223]  I want to make a quick plug.
[02:29:11.243 --> 02:29:13.424]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[02:29:13.464 --> 02:29:29.874]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[02:29:30.572 --> 02:29:34.933]  And it helped channel that zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[02:29:34.953 --> 02:29:49.136]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctors sell for like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[02:29:49.496 --> 02:29:54.158]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[02:29:54.198 --> 02:29:55.638]  So thanks for the plug.
[02:30:54.063 --> 02:30:55.448]  Ho, ho, ho, ho!
[02:30:55.629 --> 02:30:58.098]  Merry Christmas!
[02:31:00.202 --> 02:31:02.123]  Now let's go to Old Dude in Missouri.
[02:31:02.263 --> 02:31:03.163]  Old Dude, thanks for holding.
[02:31:03.183 --> 02:31:03.443]  Go ahead.
[02:31:03.583 --> 02:31:05.904]  First off, man, hey, I just want to thank you for what you've done.
[02:31:05.944 --> 02:31:07.004]  I know you hear that a lot.
[02:31:07.044 --> 02:31:10.545]  You've been very influential in a lot of people's lives.
[02:31:10.585 --> 02:31:15.547]  Second thing I want to say is the bodies and the X2 is amazing.
[02:31:15.767 --> 02:31:16.967]  I played football in college.
[02:31:17.067 --> 02:31:18.007]  I had some injuries.
[02:31:18.267 --> 02:31:21.949]  And the bodies allows me to do things that most people my age just can't do.
[02:31:22.189 --> 02:31:28.130]  I mean, I went out and played flag football here a few weeks ago and was running with guys that were in their early 20s, and I'm almost 40.
[02:31:28.651 --> 02:31:29.891]  So the products are awesome.
[02:31:30.211 --> 02:31:37.535]  As far as what Donald Trump could do is make a call out to all local law enforcement and militias to organize all able-bodied patriots.
[02:31:37.675 --> 02:31:44.298]  And now I realize he would be signaling to the people who have control over things in the economy and they could take some steps.
[02:31:44.798 --> 02:31:50.841]  But if we can organize together, I feel like that could be an effective thing that we could do to keep our own local communities safe.
[02:31:51.201 --> 02:31:51.841]  That's right, brother.
[02:31:51.941 --> 02:31:55.103]  It is a spiritual war, and we see the enemy attacking.
[02:31:55.683 --> 02:31:58.044]  That's because the enemy knows it's in trouble.
[02:31:58.124 --> 02:31:59.305]  It's been forced out in the open.
[02:31:59.525 --> 02:32:03.487]  So as negative as this is at one level, I see it as very, very positive at others.
[02:32:04.187 --> 02:32:09.910]  So people need to organize, and they need to stand on the foundation of reality that God has provided us.
[02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:23.180]  Through Jesus Christ and the people who brought the message forth to the world and understand that we have God on our side because the literal essence of his truth is written in his words and communicated to humanity.
[02:32:35.248 --> 02:32:43.393]  Not David Rockefeller, not Bill Gates, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, but Jesus Christ is King!
[02:32:45.895 --> 02:32:51.639]  And God gave us and rose up Donald Trump to stand against the enemy and draw out the enemy.
[02:32:52.019 --> 02:32:59.424]  So as dark as some of these days are, understand this is the beginning of the great revival before the Antichrist comes!
[02:33:02.205 --> 02:33:06.286]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:06.826 --> 02:33:08.127]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.869 --> 02:33:17.990]  Bells will be ringing.
[02:33:18.090 --> 02:33:19.390]  The glad, glad news.
[02:33:23.624 --> 02:33:27.067]  Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues.
[02:33:27.127 --> 02:33:28.368]  My baby's gone.
[02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:32.252]  I have no friends to wish me greetings once again.
[02:33:32.272 --> 02:33:33.934]  Why, I will be singing
[02:33:50.186 --> 02:33:52.567]  Ezra Levant is our guest here today.
[02:33:52.587 --> 02:34:09.391]  I'm Alex Jones and he is with Rebel Media out of Canada and has broken huge news of a whole bunch of secret military operations inside Canada over the years under Trudeau with the Communist Chinese who are incredibly aggressive taking over
[02:34:10.331 --> 02:34:12.152]  Africa, the South China Sea, you name it.
[02:34:12.812 --> 02:34:18.636]  And then when Trudeau found out they got mad, the Canadian military did, saying, hey, we're getting spied on here.
[02:34:18.916 --> 02:34:19.776]  Well, he blew up at them.
[02:34:20.036 --> 02:34:23.898]  And then, Ezra, let's go back to this and make the other point you got cut off before the break here.
[02:34:24.259 --> 02:34:25.840]  Again, here on the Alex Jones Show, people just tuned in.
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:29.201]  How do you think you got the secret documents?
[02:34:29.241 --> 02:34:36.906]  You asked for a FOIA request about Canadian troops going to Wuhan months before the outbreak, and then you get all these secret documents that aren't blacked out.
[02:34:37.126 --> 02:34:39.447]  Have you any idea why that happened or what's going on?
[02:34:40.350 --> 02:34:41.611]  You know, I can only speculate.
[02:34:41.691 --> 02:34:45.473]  I mean, I suppose the simplest answer is they just made a mistake.
[02:34:45.894 --> 02:34:48.876]  But that's an awfully big mistake that a lot of people didn't catch.
[02:34:49.396 --> 02:35:05.007]  Another more conspiratorial speculation is that someone inside the government wanted the world to know, and they knew that if they gave these documents to, say, Trudeau's CBC state broadcaster, the documents probably would have been sat on.
[02:35:05.507 --> 02:35:07.728]  But by giving it to us, they knew we would publish it.
[02:35:08.008 --> 02:35:08.809]  Because that's the thing.
[02:35:09.189 --> 02:35:11.130]  I asked a very narrow question.
[02:35:11.570 --> 02:35:18.433]  Did Canada send a delegation to the 70th anniversary birthday party for the People's Liberation Army Navy?
[02:35:18.493 --> 02:35:23.535]  I thought that was a gross thing to celebrate for Canadians, for a NATO country.
[02:35:24.035 --> 02:35:27.017]  They could have given me a one-line answer, a one-page answer.
[02:35:27.377 --> 02:35:30.858]  But they gave me 34 pages on a whole bunch of related things.
[02:35:31.419 --> 02:35:34.020]  I don't even understand how that can happen except
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:35.301]  On purpose.
[02:35:35.361 --> 02:35:41.566]  So, I don't know if it was on purpose or by mistake, but the fact is we have the documents.
[02:35:41.926 --> 02:35:43.247]  We were given them legally.
[02:35:44.148 --> 02:35:44.828]  I didn't steal them.
[02:35:45.188 --> 02:35:45.949]  I didn't hack them.
[02:35:46.289 --> 02:35:47.230]  I didn't spy for them.
[02:35:47.630 --> 02:35:51.714]  I asked for them and someone on the inside chose not to black them out.
[02:35:52.574 --> 02:35:53.375]  You know, Alex, we make
[02:35:54.005 --> 02:35:57.326]  Over a thousand FOIA requests, as they're called in the States.
[02:35:57.366 --> 02:35:58.427]  They're called something different up here.
[02:35:58.667 --> 02:36:00.048]  We make over a thousand a year.
[02:36:00.348 --> 02:36:01.268]  Some of them are trivial.
[02:36:01.488 --> 02:36:04.870]  We'll FOIA a local school board about a small issue.
[02:36:05.530 --> 02:36:19.396]  And the fact that this one topic, Canada-China military relations, out of the thousand we do a year, that this is the one that gets over-answered and unredacted.
[02:36:20.234 --> 02:36:26.839]  Feels like a miracle, because, I mean, let's say we were investigating a local school board on something and they gave too much away.
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:29.501]  Alright, it's cool, but it doesn't change the world.
[02:36:29.922 --> 02:36:32.023]  This can change the world.
[02:36:32.163 --> 02:36:32.464]  Why?
[02:36:32.484 --> 02:36:39.189]  Because it shows just how deep the pro-China forces are in our Foreign Affairs Department.
[02:36:40.043 --> 02:36:42.204]  Trying to infect our military?
[02:36:42.605 --> 02:36:45.126]  The pro-China deep state is real?
[02:36:45.526 --> 02:36:47.427]  You can see it in 34 pages?
[02:36:47.848 --> 02:36:49.329]  And let me throw one thing at you.
[02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:53.031]  I know you mentioned Stalin earlier, one of the world's worst killers.
[02:36:53.411 --> 02:36:59.414]  Well, the New York Times had a reporter named Walter Durante who covered up Stalin's crimes.
[02:36:59.695 --> 02:37:02.136]  He actually won a Pulitzer for it for the New York Times.
[02:37:02.156 --> 02:37:03.437]  He called him Uncle Joe, didn't he?
[02:37:04.517 --> 02:37:09.319]  Oh yeah, he tried to humanize Stalin, and he covered up the crimes.
[02:37:09.519 --> 02:37:16.781]  Only later was it revealed, and if I'm not mistaken, I think they might have stripped the Pulitzer posthumously from him.
[02:37:17.401 --> 02:37:23.443]  That cover-up enabled one of the crimes of the century, the crimes against humanity.
[02:37:23.463 --> 02:37:25.984]  I would say Stalin committed crimes against humanity.
[02:37:26.861 --> 02:37:37.668]  In these 34 pages, we see evidence that the Canadian diplomatic force in China is aware of atrocities, and they cover them up.
[02:37:37.688 --> 02:37:38.468]  Let me give you an example.
[02:37:39.829 --> 02:37:54.958]  In the western Chinese province of Xinjiang, where the Uyghur Muslim minority is, where there's reportedly a million or more Uyghurs, that's the name of the ethnic group, in concentration camps, slave labor camps, making your Nikes and your Adidas or whatever.
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:03.643]  The police there use an app on your smartphone to track everything, including your movements.
[02:38:04.123 --> 02:38:22.330]  And in these documents, in these 34-page documents, which you can see at thechinafiles.com, you have all the reports that our embassy in Beijing knows about this, including that they've personally observed this smartphone app at police checkpoints in Xinjiang.
[02:38:23.070 --> 02:38:24.851]  But like Walter Durante,
[02:38:25.615 --> 02:38:26.495]  They're covering it up.
[02:38:26.555 --> 02:38:29.117]  The only reason we know that is because they failed to black it out.
[02:38:29.157 --> 02:38:30.217]  They just grayed it out.
[02:38:31.138 --> 02:38:37.781]  Page after page, you see Chinese human rights atrocities blacked out.
[02:38:37.861 --> 02:38:39.881]  Except for they weren't blacked out, they were grayed out.
[02:38:39.941 --> 02:38:43.483]  So why is it that we are the Walter Durantes of 2020?
[02:38:44.363 --> 02:38:47.525]  Why is it that we're covering for Xi Jinping?
[02:38:49.343 --> 02:39:03.332]  Well, you're absolutely right, and now Apple helps run the worst death camps, gets components from it, and they're lobbying against bills that would just repudiate slave labor and make it be listed that, hey, this didn't come from a Uyghur slave camp or a Christian or a Buddhist slave camp.
[02:39:04.574 --> 02:39:08.818]  And then, we have the left just absolutely trying to cover this up.
[02:39:08.898 --> 02:39:12.842]  The Washington Post saying they hope Xi Jinping, quote, destroys President Trump.
[02:39:12.882 --> 02:39:16.586]  This is a China communist file.
[02:39:16.846 --> 02:39:23.032]  You've heard of Anglophiles, you've heard of Frankenfiles, you've heard of pedophiles, meaning somebody likes something.
[02:39:23.432 --> 02:39:27.737]  This is a Commie-Chicom file discussing
[02:39:28.277 --> 02:39:37.523]  Disgusting movement, and now Amazon and all these big corporations are bringing in the AI surveillance systems in their factories used against the Uyghurs.
[02:39:37.963 --> 02:39:39.464]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[02:39:39.984 --> 02:39:42.506]  An alliance of big tech with Mordor.
[02:39:45.067 --> 02:39:45.568]  That's true.
[02:39:45.648 --> 02:39:47.829]  What's fascinating to me is
[02:39:48.664 --> 02:39:53.905]  It's obvious that in Canada, and I'm sure it's the same for countries around the world, we know it.
[02:39:54.466 --> 02:40:08.809]  These half-redacted, these greyed out, not blacked out documents show the human rights abuses that we know about, but the fact that they're greyed out shows you what they wanted to black out, right?
[02:40:08.869 --> 02:40:12.230]  It's almost like they're directing your attention to the interesting parts.
[02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:15.551]  So why would they seek to redact
[02:40:16.681 --> 02:40:17.762]  Human rights atrocities.
[02:40:18.143 --> 02:40:19.724]  Again, that's something China's forming.
[02:40:19.744 --> 02:40:27.452]  Yeah, they're showing you what... I'm sure what happened is they gave you a blacked out copy and somebody got rebellious in the computer program and removed it.
[02:40:27.812 --> 02:40:34.019]  So they've got people trying to kick Joe Rogan off because he has free speech at Spotify, deleting my interview with him and sabotage.
[02:40:34.739 --> 02:40:35.781]  And so those are bad guys.
[02:40:35.821 --> 02:40:37.943]  But I think there's good guys obviously inside as well.
[02:40:38.939 --> 02:40:39.259]  Yeah.
[02:40:39.900 --> 02:40:50.465]  You know, one of the things that comes through again and again is how important Canada's Foreign Affairs Department believes helping Xi Jinping save face is.
[02:40:50.886 --> 02:40:54.808]  That's really what underlies all their attacks on the Canadian Armed Forces.
[02:40:55.909 --> 02:41:05.294]  They didn't want China to think for a second that we were mad at them, that we were punishing them, that we were engaging in a diplomatic response to them.
[02:41:06.022 --> 02:41:09.104]  It's all about saving face for Xi Jinping.
[02:41:09.504 --> 02:41:10.465]  It's bizarre.
[02:41:10.485 --> 02:41:11.485]  They're obsessed with it.
[02:41:11.686 --> 02:41:13.106]  And like I say... Let's be clear.
[02:41:13.126 --> 02:41:17.529]  I mean, the left wants to say, you know, that being a white man is bad.
[02:41:17.549 --> 02:41:21.432]  And YouTube says all white men will be suppressed on our platform.
[02:41:22.672 --> 02:41:24.253]  Meanwhile, they run death camps in China.
[02:41:24.674 --> 02:41:27.375]  And again, it's just worshipping the tyranny.
[02:41:27.595 --> 02:41:28.756]  It's not just covering up for it.
[02:41:28.836 --> 02:41:29.857]  It's worshipping it.
[02:41:31.018 --> 02:41:33.019]  Yeah, I find it incredible.
[02:41:36.265 --> 02:41:38.946]  The irony is, they're onto something.
[02:41:39.366 --> 02:41:44.767]  China does believe in saving face, culturally, but any dictatorship has to.
[02:41:45.167 --> 02:41:50.188]  As soon as people can laugh at a tyrant, they take away half his power, which is your fear of him.
[02:41:50.528 --> 02:42:00.090]  That's why Hong Kong democracy protesters would show Winnie the Pooh, because Xi Jinping looks a little bit like the cartoon Winnie the Pooh.
[02:42:00.130 --> 02:42:05.411]  So if you're laughing at the tyrant, you're rebelling against him, you're showing you're not afraid of him,
[02:42:06.191 --> 02:42:12.674]  I think it was Orwell who said, every joke is a little revolution.
[02:42:13.215 --> 02:42:13.755]  That's right.
[02:42:14.075 --> 02:42:18.577]  In 84, Winston is down there in the cafeteria and this other guy is making jokes that are witty.
[02:42:18.637 --> 02:42:22.519]  Even though he's pro-party, Winston goes, oh he'll be dead soon because he's funny.
[02:42:22.759 --> 02:42:23.420]  They don't want humor.
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:29.743]  Well, I think Solzhenitsyn was sent to prison for making a one-liner about Stalin's mustache.
[02:42:31.124 --> 02:42:35.267]  They're on to something when they say, you've got to let Xi Jinping save face.
[02:42:35.527 --> 02:42:37.428]  You can't embarrass Xi Jinping.
[02:42:37.628 --> 02:42:42.051]  Because culturally, it's saving face, but for any tyrant.
[02:42:42.531 --> 02:42:44.672]  And ironically, they're pointing in the wrong direction.
[02:42:44.712 --> 02:42:55.779]  Because what we should learn from that is, if you want China to amend its behavior to become more democratic, more free, less tyrannical, less abuses, commit fewer atrocities, then call them out.
[02:42:56.220 --> 02:42:56.580]  That's right.
[02:42:56.620 --> 02:42:57.180]  Call them out.
[02:42:57.240 --> 02:42:58.061]  Call tyrants out.
[02:42:59.994 --> 02:43:02.575]  Just another Brandon here for Just Another Channel.
[02:43:02.896 --> 02:43:04.136]  We're in Washington D.C.
[02:43:04.176 --> 02:43:05.397]  here stopping the steel.
[02:43:05.837 --> 02:43:10.200]  Folks, it was a 23 hour drive from Texas to D.C.
[02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:16.783]  non-stop and I've got to give it up to Turbo Force from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:16.943 --> 02:43:18.184]  I'd like to thank Alex Jones.
[02:43:18.244 --> 02:43:19.845]  I'd like to thank Infowars.com.
[02:43:20.345 --> 02:43:28.468]  For Turbo Force, because if it weren't for Turbo Force, we would have had to stop, get some rest, and probably get here the next day.
[02:43:28.828 --> 02:43:35.591]  And who wants to get here the next day when you can just drink Turbo Force from Infowarsstore.com and get here on time.
[02:43:35.831 --> 02:43:38.432]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get yours today.
[02:43:45.264 --> 02:43:52.368]  I got the documents Alex!
[02:43:52.648 --> 02:43:54.309]  I got the documents Alex Jones!
[02:43:54.610 --> 02:43:56.891]  We love you in L.A., California baby!
[02:43:56.971 --> 02:43:57.772]  I'm on it!
[02:43:57.852 --> 02:43:59.032]  I've been juiced up!
[02:43:59.352 --> 02:44:00.033]  Fighting Antifa!
[02:44:00.153 --> 02:44:02.714]  I got my crowd cause I'm a Kangaroo out here!
[02:44:02.735 --> 02:44:04.295]  Shout out to my proud boys!
[02:44:04.476 --> 02:44:05.296]  That's what's up!
[02:44:05.616 --> 02:44:06.016]  Woo!
[02:44:06.097 --> 02:44:07.978]  Alex Jones in for wars!
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:13.742]  America is awake!
[02:44:14.263 --> 02:44:16.305]  And America has only begun to fight!
[02:44:18.267 --> 02:44:23.892]  And we have just begun the occupation of D.C.
[02:44:24.252 --> 02:44:29.197]  The Tricombs and the globalists think they're taking America over!
[02:44:29.237 --> 02:44:32.580]  They just woke up the sleeping tide!
[02:44:40.733 --> 02:44:41.754]  What's up?
[02:44:41.934 --> 02:44:43.955]  I keep fighting the Infowars, baby!
[02:44:44.336 --> 02:44:45.096]  Rob Boy!
[02:44:45.336 --> 02:44:46.677]  Call your boy Alex Jones!
[02:44:46.697 --> 02:44:47.277]  Salute him!
[02:44:47.297 --> 02:44:48.798]  Thank you for everything you do!
[02:44:48.818 --> 02:44:51.520]  God bless you and all the Infowars family!
[02:44:51.540 --> 02:44:57.504]  God bless all of you in the American picture!
[02:44:57.544 --> 02:44:58.805]  Merry Christmas!
[02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:10.557]  I'm Alex Jones, and I founded Infowars more than 25 years ago out of a bedroom in my house.
[02:45:11.198 --> 02:45:20.910]  I was reading the Globalist's own documents, their own admissions of a plan for a world government and the end of America, and corporations controlling a type of planetary communism.
[02:45:21.491 --> 02:45:26.032]  Well, I knew that as this plan unfolded, Americans and others would want to resist it.
[02:45:26.472 --> 02:45:29.993]  And that's why Infowars has exploded in size and reach.
[02:45:30.673 --> 02:45:35.354]  All the corporate media's attempts to shut us down and demonize us have only blown up their face.
[02:45:35.614 --> 02:45:41.536]  Because people know we've been telling the truth on hundreds and hundreds of issues, and that's why we've been demonized.
[02:45:41.856 --> 02:45:45.677]  So America understands we've been an underdog and is standing with us.
[02:45:46.297 --> 02:45:50.941]  We are gaining more than 30 radio, TV, and cable affiliates a week.
[02:45:51.361 --> 02:45:53.203]  We are literally exploding.
[02:45:53.523 --> 02:45:55.425]  And traffic to InfoWars is exploding.
[02:45:55.745 --> 02:45:56.666]  And Band.Video.
[02:45:56.946 --> 02:46:03.292]  Because people now know that the New World Order and globalism is real, and they want to get informed, and they want to inform others.
[02:46:03.832 --> 02:46:18.717]  That's why now is the time for listeners, more than ever, who've done a great job promoting InfoWars, to contact local cable and TV stations that are not yet carrying my show or the other great InfoWars shows and news programs in their area.
[02:46:18.957 --> 02:46:22.498]  Because the stations are now more receptive than they've ever been.
[02:46:22.898 --> 02:46:27.819]  If you already have a great cable, TV or radio station that's picking up the InfoWars feed, that's wonderful.
[02:46:27.859 --> 02:46:32.481]  Spread the word about it and thank them for what they're doing and thank their sponsors or become a sponsor.
[02:46:32.841 --> 02:46:49.631]  But if you're watching and listening to us on the internet, anywhere in the United States, or even places like Canada, if you simply send the link from InfoWars.com forward slash affiliates to the local station managers and ask them to pick up InfoWars, many of the stations are doing just that.
[02:46:49.891 --> 02:46:52.492]  And then that simple action wakes up thousands.
[02:46:52.892 --> 02:46:55.434]  InfoWars.com forward slash affiliates.
[02:47:02.515 --> 02:47:06.597]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:07.117 --> 02:47:08.458]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:23.625 --> 02:47:28.228]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is an authoritarian revolution happening on the planet.
[02:47:29.042 --> 02:47:36.529]  And the globalist Robert Barron set up Mao Zedong in 49 to set up a controlled society, a laboratory of control.
[02:47:37.290 --> 02:47:37.610]  And now...
[02:47:39.413 --> 02:47:43.416]  70 years later, Communist China is the model of the planet.
[02:47:43.757 --> 02:47:55.125]  We've got this footage we can roll here, let's play it with audio, of inside Amazon factories, inside Amazon shipping centers, where people have to social distance and AI robots watch them.
[02:47:55.866 --> 02:48:00.889]  This is the control already tested in China, now being brought here with their alliance with Big Tech.
[02:48:04.497 --> 02:48:08.539]  That s**t, oh we, we, we was like too close, oh too close for comfort.
[02:48:09.319 --> 02:48:15.182]  It's been shown like when people with six feet apart and s**t, they're gonna take a picture and make me get in trouble.
[02:48:16.663 --> 02:48:21.665]  So it's all about how you're guilty, how you're bad, how robots are replacing you, or how they're
[02:48:23.015 --> 02:48:26.020]  Turning you into a robot.
[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:37.237]  Well, one way to become aware of what's happening and how these smartphones are really spy devices that surveil you and track you for hackers, government, UN contact tracers, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clintons.
[02:48:38.228 --> 02:48:39.169]  It's Privacy Pockets.
[02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:41.512]  Now, this is a high-quality Faraday cage.
[02:48:41.772 --> 02:48:44.074]  People sell the same unit we private-labeled for $29.95.
[02:48:44.134 --> 02:48:45.896]  We're selling it for $19.95.
[02:48:46.097 --> 02:48:55.387]  They cost us $11 a pouch because they're high-end, they're high-quality, and they have a 99% rate of not letting you be tracked, unlike others that are about 90%.
[02:48:55.907 --> 02:48:59.231]  And if you're right under a cell tower, you can still beam through it and still track where you're at.
[02:48:59.571 --> 02:49:03.553]  But that's the way to put your phone away, to have less screen time, to be aware of how you're being tracked.
[02:49:03.973 --> 02:49:06.494]  This is the best stocking stuffer, the best Christmas present.
[02:49:06.734 --> 02:49:10.356]  We've got it in four different colors, blue, green, red, and black.
[02:49:10.816 --> 02:49:11.837]  They've been sold out for months.
[02:49:12.776 --> 02:49:13.576]  They're back in stock.
[02:49:14.117 --> 02:49:17.519]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:17.539 --> 02:49:17.859]  888-253-3139.
[02:49:18.219 --> 02:49:22.841]  See 100% reviews.
[02:49:22.861 --> 02:49:25.443]  We've tested a lot of other ones out that aren't as good.
[02:49:25.723 --> 02:49:27.624]  They're still pretty good, but these are the best we've found.
[02:49:27.964 --> 02:49:29.085]  And they're pretty low priced.
[02:49:29.265 --> 02:49:32.727]  We've had like $40 ones that cost us like $20 to buy that didn't even work as well.
[02:49:33.087 --> 02:49:34.428]  So those are at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:49:34.448 --> 02:49:38.130]  We also have a 60% off and free shipping, double Patriot points.
[02:49:38.570 --> 02:49:39.630]  And if you get your orders in by the 18th,
[02:49:41.158 --> 02:49:43.600]  You will get it before Christmas here in the United States.
[02:49:43.660 --> 02:49:47.482]  So take advantage of the big Christmas mega sale at mfullmorestore.com.
[02:49:48.303 --> 02:49:54.167]  We're funded by you, not by Bill Gates, not by the New World Order, not by Xi Jinping.
[02:49:54.727 --> 02:49:58.430]  Getting back to Ezra Levant, final segment we have with him.
[02:49:58.450 --> 02:50:04.454]  I'm going to play this clip one more time and then give you the floor to add any other key points or addendums of where this huge story of
[02:50:05.074 --> 02:50:27.211]  All these secret communist Chinese drills in Canada, and then finally the military saying no, and your globalist Prime Minister getting angry with that clip of him a few years ago saying, I admire communist China the most in a TV show, just incredible, because they have a basic dictatorship and do the best job.
[02:50:27.472 --> 02:50:30.954]  I mean, this is just an incredible admission of these authoritarians.
[02:50:30.994 --> 02:50:31.315]  Here it is.
[02:50:32.329 --> 02:50:37.474]  You notice that's pretty boy Trudeau with a bunch of women.
[02:50:38.275 --> 02:50:38.936]  Stockholmson.
[02:50:39.536 --> 02:50:42.119]  I'm not putting women down on a statistics show.
[02:50:42.159 --> 02:50:44.641]  They'll go under dictatorship a lot quicker.
[02:50:54.491 --> 02:50:54.832]  I don't know.
[02:51:10.305 --> 02:51:10.645]  He should.
[02:51:10.946 --> 02:51:12.267]  This is enough to have him raided.
[02:51:12.287 --> 02:51:14.148]  This is enough to have his files checked.
[02:51:14.228 --> 02:51:24.877]  I bet you he's getting some money from some Chinese front companies, just like the big voting machine companies are in the case of Smartmatic and the case, of course, of Dominion.
[02:51:24.897 --> 02:51:25.338]  What do you think?
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:28.722]  Well, there's actually no need for an investigation.
[02:51:28.762 --> 02:51:30.564]  We already know the facts about that.
[02:51:30.945 --> 02:51:38.012]  There are a bunch of groups around Justin Trudeau that are not formally his political party, but they're associated with him.
[02:51:38.352 --> 02:51:40.074]  There's the Trudeau Foundation.
[02:51:40.454 --> 02:51:44.258]  There's his sort of in-house think tank called Canada 2020.
[02:51:44.718 --> 02:51:48.482]  And they take massive donations directly from China.
[02:51:48.502 --> 02:51:50.104]  For example, Huawei.
[02:51:50.664 --> 02:51:55.090]  The monster tech company that wants to build 5G around the world.
[02:51:55.411 --> 02:51:58.735]  They're a major, major donor to Canada 2020.
[02:51:59.055 --> 02:52:01.218]  Trudeau's in-house think tank.
[02:52:01.258 --> 02:52:02.420]  So he's not even hiding it.
[02:52:03.321 --> 02:52:06.886]  Other donors, even six figures plus.
[02:52:08.718 --> 02:52:09.118]  It's
[02:52:30.962 --> 02:52:42.610]  They like China, or they just support whoever is against the West, or they like Trudeau, or, just as likely, their own media companies are compromised in some way.
[02:52:42.910 --> 02:52:46.653]  You know, there's nothing cheaper to buy off than a journalist in the year 2020.
[02:52:47.053 --> 02:52:49.775]  Media companies are broke, and who has all the cash?
[02:52:50.256 --> 02:52:50.556]  China.
[02:52:51.215 --> 02:53:00.740]  So, I mean, why do you think media companies would be less susceptible to Chinese cash and honey traps than any other industry?
[02:53:01.121 --> 02:53:03.222]  And why do they have all the cash?
[02:53:03.322 --> 02:53:05.623]  They've closed a few months, have been open.
[02:53:06.023 --> 02:53:07.964]  We're supposedly never going to reopen.
[02:53:08.364 --> 02:53:12.767]  And these same China-centric politicians tell us, China did a great job.
[02:53:13.167 --> 02:53:15.448]  You'll never be open until you give us martial law.
[02:53:15.789 --> 02:53:18.190]  I mean, this is really, you can see the psy-op is right there.
[02:53:19.468 --> 02:53:23.170]  Who are the biggest boosters of the lockdowns in the West?
[02:53:23.330 --> 02:53:29.594]  Aside from the public health officers who are enjoying their moment of fame, Dr. Fauci, etc.
[02:53:30.115 --> 02:53:31.055]  It's the media.
[02:53:31.375 --> 02:53:34.097]  The media who put on their masks when they're on camera.
[02:53:34.137 --> 02:53:38.039]  The second they think they're off camera, they throw the mask away and say, I'm not pretending.
[02:53:38.360 --> 02:53:41.482]  The people who go to the fancy restaurants with Gavin Newsom.
[02:53:42.502 --> 02:53:44.623]  The people who get their hair done with Nancy Pelosi.
[02:53:44.884 --> 02:53:47.905]  But then when the lights and camera are on, they want a lockdown for the rest of us.
[02:53:47.925 --> 02:53:48.506]  So my point is,
[02:53:49.699 --> 02:53:58.629]  The media are the least skeptical about China and they're really the enforcers of the pandemic lockdown even though they themselves have never lost a day's work.
[02:53:58.709 --> 02:54:04.216]  And they're the ones pushing censorship of the independent media because they can't survive if we're still there in closing.
[02:54:05.518 --> 02:54:13.364]  Is it not positive, though, that Swallow's Well and Biden and his son and his brother are under criminal investigation, and more and more of this is coming out?
[02:54:13.404 --> 02:54:14.185]  And that's a good sign.
[02:54:14.545 --> 02:54:16.486]  All these states have joined the Supreme Court.
[02:54:16.506 --> 02:54:19.348]  The Supreme Court's taken the case about this illegal ballots.
[02:54:19.408 --> 02:54:21.230]  I mean, this is a crazy time.
[02:54:22.543 --> 02:54:30.290]  It's true, and I like the fact that you're taking a glass-half-full approach, because the world is full of bad news, and you have pointed out some glimmers of hope.
[02:54:30.791 --> 02:54:35.235]  But wouldn't it have been nice to have known many of these things, including about Hunter Biden?
[02:54:36.045 --> 02:54:39.650]  Before the election, as you point out, the big tech companies censored it.
[02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:42.714]  But we'll keep fighting up here, and I know you'll keep fighting down there.
[02:54:43.455 --> 02:54:48.802]  Alright, Ezra, what else do you have cooking in the last 60 seconds at Rebel Media?
[02:54:48.842 --> 02:54:50.464]  I mean, you've always got huge stuff.
[02:54:50.484 --> 02:54:53.028]  Give us a little prelude to what you might have come out next.
[02:54:54.042 --> 02:55:02.333]  Well, you know, we've started a civil liberties project in Canada, Australia and the UK for people who have been given outrageous lockdown fines.
[02:55:02.393 --> 02:55:04.676]  It's a program called FightTheFines.com.
[02:55:05.117 --> 02:55:07.200]  We're actually offering free lawyers
[02:55:07.970 --> 02:55:11.131]  To the first 1,000 people that have lockdown fines.
[02:55:11.511 --> 02:55:12.771]  We hired a bunch of lawyers.
[02:55:12.811 --> 02:55:14.092]  We're doing a civil liberties fight.
[02:55:14.352 --> 02:55:15.972]  That's our big project next, Alex.
[02:55:16.473 --> 02:55:17.733]  Well, I mean, I'm not just saying this.
[02:55:18.753 --> 02:55:21.494]  I admire you because you take so much action.
[02:55:21.814 --> 02:55:24.515]  You get so much results because you actually do it.
[02:55:24.875 --> 02:55:30.938]  And I just, so does Project Veritas, but I think you're like the Veritas of Canada, but you also affect the rest of the world.
[02:55:30.958 --> 02:55:34.740]  So, Ezra, please, anytime you've got news, you know, we called you, you were ready to come on.
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:41.743]  A lot of times you've got too much going on, I get it, but anytime you want to get to this audience and tell people about what's going on, please reach out to us.
[02:55:42.043 --> 02:55:43.184]  We really, really appreciate you.
[02:55:43.204 --> 02:55:44.304]  We've got a lot of websites.
[02:55:44.704 --> 02:55:45.565]  What's the best one?
[02:55:45.605 --> 02:55:47.506]  What's the mothership for folks to visit?
[02:55:47.546 --> 02:55:47.986]  Rebel Media?
[02:55:48.982 --> 02:55:56.467]  RebelNews.com, RebelNews.com, and you can find out all we're up to, and you can obviously read these secret documents there, too.
[02:55:56.547 --> 02:55:59.189]  So, thanks for the opportunity to talk to your people, Alex.
[02:55:59.950 --> 02:56:00.610]  Ezra, we love you.
[02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:01.050]  Godspeed.
[02:56:02.071 --> 02:56:10.877]  Okay, next hour, former head of psychological operations for the State Department and the CIA, Dr. Steve Pachinik, will join us on the election and a lot more.
[02:56:11.498 --> 02:56:12.458]  You do not want to miss that.
[02:56:12.598 --> 02:56:13.799]  I will just say this right now.
[02:56:16.055 --> 02:56:23.860]  I sleep great knowing that Ezra Levine's out there, and I sleep great knowing OAN's out there, and Newsmax, and Right Side, and just everybody.
[02:56:23.900 --> 02:56:27.043]  But, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:56:27.363 --> 02:56:31.306]  We are the enemy's main threat because we have the largest audience of you badasses.
[02:56:32.006 --> 02:56:32.266]  Okay?
[02:56:32.586 --> 02:56:33.667]  So, it's you they hate.
[02:56:34.067 --> 02:56:34.327]  Okay?
[02:56:34.427 --> 02:56:35.667]  I mean, hell, I'm not even that important.
[02:56:35.687 --> 02:56:37.148]  It's all these guests, as you just heard.
[02:56:37.528 --> 02:56:40.669]  So, remember that they are working around the clock.
[02:56:40.789 --> 02:56:44.450]  You know to tune in to the local radio station, or TV station, or InfoWars.com.
[02:56:44.770 --> 02:56:47.431]  But I run into people all the time, I used to love you, I wish you were still on air.
[02:56:47.451 --> 02:56:50.032]  I heard you're off air, because I'm not on Facebook or YouTube.
[02:56:50.292 --> 02:56:51.712]  I'm like, no, no, I'm at Bandop Video.
[02:56:51.772 --> 02:56:52.072]  Really?
[02:56:52.352 --> 02:56:53.033]  You're still on air?
[02:56:53.113 --> 02:56:57.374]  I mean, I can't go to the grocery store, or a restaurant, and it gets tears in my eyes, because
[02:56:58.786 --> 02:57:05.829]  I look at these people, old ladies, young men, black, white, I go, hey, you're habituated to going to Facebook and Twitter.
[02:57:06.089 --> 02:57:07.109]  They're like, what's habituated?
[02:57:07.149 --> 02:57:08.109]  You know, you have a habit.
[02:57:08.930 --> 02:57:11.631]  Because I'm not in your feed doesn't mean that I'm not there.
[02:57:11.871 --> 02:57:14.372]  Infowars.com.
[02:57:14.692 --> 02:57:15.412]  Band.video.
[02:57:15.452 --> 02:57:19.434]  And a lot of folks get that, but it's not about, oh, I want the biggest show, I want the traffic.
[02:57:19.594 --> 02:57:21.094]  I want to beat this steel.
[02:57:21.434 --> 02:57:24.315]  They wanted us off the air because we've got the globalist number.
[02:57:24.956 --> 02:57:28.277]  So, whatever you do for yourself and your family this Christmas,
[02:57:29.420 --> 02:57:32.342]  Or Hanukkah, or whatever the hell you want to call it, you better do this.
[02:57:32.922 --> 02:57:39.006]  You better spread the word about whatever you think the best news organization is standing up for your freedom and all our freedom collectively.
[02:57:39.206 --> 02:57:41.627]  And I believe InfoWars.com is that site.
[02:57:41.788 --> 02:57:45.690]  But whatever you do, don't stay silent, because your word of mouth is king.
[02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:48.331]  Hour number three, two minutes ahead.
[02:57:48.352 --> 02:57:48.792]  Stay with us.
[02:57:50.026 --> 02:57:51.327]  Phil in Buffalo, New York.
[02:57:51.627 --> 02:57:52.528]  Phil, thank you for calling.
[02:57:52.668 --> 02:57:55.830]  First off, Commander-in-Chief needs to stand up and be Commander-in-Chief.
[02:57:56.211 --> 02:58:03.836]  Every night I'm going to bed, I'm praying for you, I'm praying for all the info warriors, I'm more praying for all the humans that don't know what's really coming to them.
[02:58:04.457 --> 02:58:09.160]  Everybody takes me as wrong, thinking I'm like, I get angry because I want something.
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:10.701]  No, this is about humanity.
[02:58:11.081 --> 02:58:13.083]  Humans are being taken over.
[02:58:13.543 --> 02:58:19.848]  Now, I'm noticing a lack of concern because everybody is addicted to their Facebook and their Instagram.
[02:58:20.028 --> 02:58:21.269]  They can't just put it down.
[02:58:21.569 --> 02:58:23.931]  Now's not the time to be lacked for concern.
[02:58:24.271 --> 02:58:34.759]  Commander-in-Chief, his first duty is protect our citizens and protect this country, and him as a president wouldn't be calling martial law if he just simply comes out and explains.
[02:58:34.779 --> 02:58:37.861]  They're ignoring the little radio shows and Fox Business he goes on.
[02:58:38.102 --> 02:58:42.545]  He needs to be Resolute Desk, giving speeches to the American people, laying out what's happened.
[02:58:43.393 --> 02:58:50.654]  Because this has been going on for 25 years, he's only been for 4 years, he's been able to expose everything that's been going on.
[02:58:50.914 --> 02:58:57.796]  But we all have to be there, the 5th and the 6th, and not for a party thing, not for any reason like that.
[02:58:58.016 --> 02:59:07.337]  We all need to be off of the streets before the dark falls because that's when the Democrats send out their Antifa rally people to come and attack families and stuff like that.
[02:59:07.637 --> 02:59:10.178]  We need to be there that entire week.
[02:59:10.478 --> 02:59:16.100]  We are protesting and getting Trump back into our offices on the weekends.
[02:59:16.140 --> 02:59:17.741]  We should be at our state capitals.
[02:59:18.081 --> 02:59:24.664]  We have the right to remove any one of the senators in any one of their state positions because those are our state buildings.
[02:59:24.904 --> 02:59:27.765]  Those are the senators or the governor's buildings.
[02:59:28.005 --> 02:59:36.469]  Those are the people's buildings that we have elected officials in there to be governing just to make sure that we follow the laws that need to be followed not to be
[02:59:36.909 --> 02:59:42.173]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.521 --> 03:00:16.545]  Hello everybody, welcome back.
[03:00:16.946 --> 03:00:20.947]  It is the Summit News Hour with me, your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:20.967 --> 03:00:24.428]  I hope you're all having a good preparation for Christmas.
[03:00:25.328 --> 03:00:30.450]  My Christmas has been completely ruined and now I'm trapped here on what is being referred to as
[03:00:31.536 --> 03:00:32.737]  Plague Island!
[03:00:32.837 --> 03:00:35.920]  Yes, it was racist to call it the China virus.
[03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:41.664]  It was racist to suggest that we should stop incoming flights from China back in March.
[03:00:42.225 --> 03:00:44.967]  That was bigoted, that was xenophobic, that was horrific.
[03:00:45.467 --> 03:00:55.555]  But it's perfectly fine to ban British people from dozens of countries around the world and refer to the British Isles as Plague Island.
[03:00:55.595 --> 03:00:56.476]  So I am indeed
[03:00:57.307 --> 03:01:00.568]  Trapped alone on Plague Island for Christmas.
[03:01:01.049 --> 03:01:02.569]  It's going to be another fun one.
[03:01:03.470 --> 03:01:17.516]  And the reason for that is because on Saturday afternoon, our esteemed Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that London and the southeast of England would be placed into what they refer to as Tier 4.
[03:01:18.076 --> 03:01:22.138]  Of course, that's just another name for complete and total lockdown.
[03:01:23.099 --> 03:01:23.759]  They banned
[03:01:24.798 --> 03:01:29.420]  Not only people travelling outside their immediate area, they banned all international travel.
[03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:36.123]  So now basically I'm banned from travelling 30 or 40 miles to the next tier down.
[03:01:36.183 --> 03:01:37.044]  That's illegal.
[03:01:37.464 --> 03:01:42.266]  So if you've got family, if you've got granny 30 miles away, you can't go and visit her.
[03:01:42.326 --> 03:01:43.067]  That's illegal.
[03:01:43.107 --> 03:01:44.427]  You may get stopped by the police.
[03:01:45.108 --> 03:01:46.008]  You may get fined.
[03:01:46.228 --> 03:01:47.449]  You may even get arrested.
[03:01:48.389 --> 03:01:50.070]  You can't travel internationally.
[03:01:50.967 --> 03:02:00.254]  Because they ban you domestically from doing so, and in dozens of different countries now they're banning people from Britain being allowed into those countries.
[03:02:00.835 --> 03:02:03.597]  That's all illegal, but you know what isn't illegal?
[03:02:04.217 --> 03:02:12.184]  Flights landing from Africa, Brazil, China, and every other country on the planet, landing at London airports.
[03:02:12.784 --> 03:02:15.146]  These people from China, Brazil, Africa.
[03:02:15.586 --> 03:02:18.989]  Brazil, by the way, over 7 million coronavirus cases.
[03:02:19.972 --> 03:02:29.999]  This new strain, the mutant strain that we're all supposed to be terrified of, was found in Brazil eight months ago, but those people are allowed to come here
[03:02:30.911 --> 03:02:38.278]  In fact, multiple flights from Sao Paulo, Brazil, landing basically every half an hour at Heathrow Airport, at Gatwick Airport.
[03:02:38.718 --> 03:02:45.825]  Those people are allowed to come here, even though they've got record coronavirus cases, even though they've got the new mutant strain and had it eight months ago.
[03:02:46.226 --> 03:02:52.692]  They can come here, but because Boris Johnson has literally set up internal borders while leaving
[03:02:53.292 --> 03:02:55.314]  The external border's wide open.
[03:02:55.814 --> 03:03:02.160]  I'm not allowed to travel 20, 30 miles away to see family in a different tier.
[03:03:03.121 --> 03:03:05.343]  We literally have internal borders.
[03:03:06.260 --> 03:03:08.583]  And I mean, they're just taking the piss at this point.
[03:03:08.603 --> 03:03:09.764]  They're taking the piss.
[03:03:10.105 --> 03:03:11.306]  We have flights landing.
[03:03:11.366 --> 03:03:17.053]  I hear them every five minutes overhead at Heathrow Airport from every other country in the world.
[03:03:17.433 --> 03:03:22.920]  But if I go to Brighton, if I go 40, 50 miles away, I face arrests and fines.
[03:03:24.096 --> 03:03:25.096]  That's the situation.
[03:03:25.737 --> 03:03:30.078]  Again, because of this new mutant strain which they're claiming is new, which isn't new.
[03:03:30.419 --> 03:03:31.679]  It's already in Europe.
[03:03:31.819 --> 03:03:33.420]  It was in Brazil eight months ago.
[03:03:33.900 --> 03:03:42.843]  Now you have top scientists, you have a top German virologist, which we're going to get into on the other side of the break, saying that they weren't even informed of this new strain.
[03:03:43.104 --> 03:03:46.765]  There are literally 300 different strains of coronavirus.
[03:03:47.065 --> 03:03:48.946]  It was announced on a press conference
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:04:00.781]  Literally putting tens of millions of people on the eve of Christmas under de facto house arrest, ruining their Christmas plans, and then prompting this mass travel ban.
[03:04:01.736 --> 03:04:09.163]  In Spain, Germany, France and all these other countries from Brits trying to enter other countries to visit their family members.
[03:04:09.603 --> 03:04:15.288]  Oh and by the way, if you've booked a flight, which many people have, their Christmas plans are already completely ruined.
[03:04:15.589 --> 03:04:19.692]  But not only that, they're not even going to get refunds on the flights.
[03:04:20.293 --> 03:04:23.676]  The flight operators are still operating the flights because maybe
[03:04:24.429 --> 03:04:27.931]  Two Spanish people are going home from London back to Spain.
[03:04:28.332 --> 03:04:37.898]  So rather than cancel the flights and have to give people their refunds, they're going to still operate all the flights, even though they'll be 95% empty.
[03:04:38.439 --> 03:04:43.622]  And when people complained about this to the government, they said, there's nothing whatsoever we can do about it.
[03:04:43.922 --> 03:04:47.905]  So they were screwed by Boris because their Christmas plans were ruined.
[03:04:47.925 --> 03:04:48.986]  They're not going to see their family.
[03:04:49.781 --> 03:04:53.907]  And now they're being screwed by the airlines because they're not going to get their refunds.
[03:04:53.947 --> 03:04:55.389]  We'll get into that and more on the other side.
[03:04:55.710 --> 03:04:56.691]  Summit.News.
[03:04:56.751 --> 03:04:57.212]  Don't go away.
[03:05:01.260 --> 03:05:08.124]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[03:05:08.585 --> 03:05:10.025]  We've got two different big sales.
[03:05:10.045 --> 03:05:17.050]  We've got Super Metal Vitality Turbo Force and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[03:05:17.270 --> 03:05:21.953]  We've got Bodies, Vazo Beats, and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack,
[03:05:22.293 --> 03:05:22.693]  At 40% off.
[03:05:22.733 --> 03:05:30.300]  But if you get both of these packs together, they are 60% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[03:05:30.561 --> 03:05:31.522]  The best deal ever.
[03:05:31.842 --> 03:05:37.027]  I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you to go to InfoWarsTore.com today and take advantage of this.
[03:05:37.287 --> 03:05:39.729]  And you can't lose because it funds the InfoWar.
[03:05:40.029 --> 03:05:46.956]  Again, get the great products at InfoWarsTore.com and fund the Second American Revolution worldwide at a time that's more critical than ever.
[03:05:47.456 --> 03:05:56.582]  Again, the year 2021 is here, and I am committed to you to fight against the globalists harder than ever, so thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight.
[03:05:56.742 --> 03:05:58.463]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[03:06:02.925 --> 03:06:08.369]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:12.867 --> 03:06:23.373]  So we have a situation in the United Kingdom where the pubs are closed, Christmas is cancelled, people's plans are being completely ruined, they're not going to see their family members, but guess what?
[03:06:23.774 --> 03:06:31.478]  The borders, the external borders at least, are going to remain wide open to anyone who wants to enter this country.
[03:06:32.039 --> 03:06:38.623]  I can't travel 30 miles away because I face fines and arrests because I'm in Tier 4 and I can't go to Tier 3.
[03:06:40.359 --> 03:06:51.929]  But if people from Shanghai, Beijing, Sao Paulo or Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya want to visit the United Kingdom and visit London, they're perfectly free to do so.
[03:06:52.830 --> 03:06:54.771]  In what world does that make any sense?
[03:06:55.692 --> 03:07:02.158]  Flights from Africa, Brazil and China continue to land at Heathrow, even as Londoners are banned from travel.
[03:07:03.157 --> 03:07:14.300]  Flights from countries all over the world, including COVID-19 hotspots like Brazil, continue to land at London airports, despite Londoners themselves being banned by law from travelling outside the area.
[03:07:15.481 --> 03:07:26.464]  If you want to go on FlightAware, the FlightAware website, and zero in on London, and then go a little bit west, where you'll find Heathrow Airport,
[03:07:27.310 --> 03:07:28.771]  You can click on all the planes.
[03:07:28.811 --> 03:07:31.433]  You can see where they're coming from, where they're going to.
[03:07:31.693 --> 03:07:32.874]  They're coming from Kenya.
[03:07:33.234 --> 03:07:34.595]  They're coming from Sao Paulo.
[03:07:34.915 --> 03:07:36.876]  They're coming from Beijing.
[03:07:37.257 --> 03:07:38.618]  They're coming from everywhere.
[03:07:38.658 --> 03:07:40.279]  They can get in, but we can't get out.
[03:07:40.819 --> 03:07:50.986]  Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday London and the south-east of England would be placed under a new lockdown, Tier 4, making it illegal for Londoners to travel outside the region.
[03:07:51.877 --> 03:07:58.842]  He also revealed that people living in Tier 4 areas would be banned from international travel, forcing millions of Brits who plan to visit family abroad to cancel their Christmas.
[03:07:59.202 --> 03:08:01.704]  And who knows when we'll be allowed to travel again?
[03:08:02.164 --> 03:08:05.386]  And if we'll be allowed to travel without the vaccine?
[03:08:05.967 --> 03:08:13.392]  Even to get to Spain, and now this is already being introduced by numerous of the European countries, you had to get a Covid test.
[03:08:14.053 --> 03:08:18.775]  A PCR test and prove it was negative simply to get into Spain.
[03:08:18.795 --> 03:08:22.117]  And of course we know these PCR tests are notoriously unreliable.
[03:08:22.517 --> 03:08:26.339]  They produce false positives repeatedly.
[03:08:27.339 --> 03:08:28.600]  They're totally unreliable.
[03:08:29.140 --> 03:08:31.301]  So you could not have COVID whatsoever.
[03:08:31.361 --> 03:08:36.043]  We've had people taking these tests who have had COVID six weeks ago.
[03:08:37.044 --> 03:08:38.405]  They've completely recovered.
[03:08:38.765 --> 03:08:43.347]  Six weeks to two months later, they take the PCR test and it says they've still got COVID.
[03:08:45.083 --> 03:08:47.325]  And that's the thin end of the wedge.
[03:08:48.205 --> 03:08:52.949]  Next it will be if you don't have the vaccine passport, which initially they denied they were even planning.
[03:08:53.390 --> 03:08:57.993]  Now they're literally planning it in government documents to enter other countries.
[03:08:58.053 --> 03:09:11.264]  And we got more on that in terms of France and Germany talking about banning people who don't have the vaccine from using public transport and entering other venues and in fact being denied medical care altogether.
[03:09:11.284 --> 03:09:14.046]  I'm going to get onto that later on in the show.
[03:09:15.945 --> 03:09:24.152]  This article continues, while Londoners are not allowed to hop on a flight, plane loads full of foreign visitors continue to land at Heathrow and other major airports in the region.
[03:09:24.793 --> 03:09:29.837]  Two days after Londoners were banned from travel or flight from Nairobi, Kenya landed at Heathrow.
[03:09:30.198 --> 03:09:37.584]  Oh, that's obviously very crucially important that we import Kenyans during the height of a pandemic.
[03:09:37.964 --> 03:09:38.785]  That's crucial.
[03:09:39.305 --> 03:09:40.867]  We can't stop that from happening.
[03:09:42.099 --> 03:09:43.620]  That's really important, isn't it?
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:50.003]  Flights from China, the original source of the coronavirus, also continue to land in London on a regular basis.
[03:09:51.204 --> 03:10:00.409]  Yesterday, no less than five flights from Brazil arrived at Heathrow Airport, despite the country registering over 7 million COVID-19 cases.
[03:10:01.509 --> 03:10:04.671]  And then we get on to the reason behind all this.
[03:10:06.047 --> 03:10:14.750]  The reason why Prime Minister Boris Johnson has literally created internal borders within the United Kingdom while leaving the external borders wide open.
[03:10:15.891 --> 03:10:17.211]  In fact, we have another article here.
[03:10:17.271 --> 03:10:22.093]  Video pictures British travellers held against their will at German airports.
[03:10:23.234 --> 03:10:29.196]  Chaos unfolded in the UK with the government touting an unverified mutant strain of Covid.
[03:10:29.216 --> 03:10:31.297]  There are literally 200 different strains.
[03:10:32.497 --> 03:10:33.178]  Literally 200 or more.
[03:10:35.166 --> 03:10:40.448]  It's not more harmful than the original one, but this is the excuse.
[03:10:41.268 --> 03:10:47.491]  To justify a fresh lockdown, video has emerged of British travellers being herded inside foreign airports and held against their will.
[03:10:48.271 --> 03:10:58.415]  The footage shows health officials and nurses, some in full hazmat gear, administering immediate Covid-19 tests as passengers plead, please help us leave.
[03:10:59.591 --> 03:11:08.252]  So they introduced these COVID tests as a mandatory measure to be allowed to get into the country on a whim while people were literally still in the air on these planes.
[03:11:09.473 --> 03:11:16.994]  Oh, and by the way, that costs another £200 to go and get a COVID test, a PCR test that isn't even reliable.
[03:11:17.674 --> 03:11:28.796]  So a lot of these people who have family in Spain, in France, in all these other countries, not only are they not going to get their money back on the flight, because they're still operating the flights, even though they're completely empty,
[03:11:29.637 --> 03:11:50.076]  Ryanair in particular, they've also shelled out £200, over $200 on these PCR tests, which are now completely redundant, because they're literally banned from leaving the country, and even if they manage to leave the country somehow, they're banned from getting into Spain and France and Germany and these other countries.
[03:11:51.749 --> 03:11:55.372]  Quoting here, we are at Hanover Airport and we are held against our will.
[03:11:55.752 --> 03:12:00.135]  We were tested and were prohibited from leaving the premises while awaiting the results.
[03:12:01.756 --> 03:12:09.742]  Hanover health official Andreas Krentz told German newswire DPA that, quote, our aim is to prevent the new variant of the virus from entering the region.
[03:12:10.022 --> 03:12:11.683]  It's already in the region.
[03:12:12.184 --> 03:12:13.885]  It's spread throughout Europe.
[03:12:15.026 --> 03:12:16.887]  It was in Brazil eight months ago.
[03:12:16.987 --> 03:12:21.891]  How is it not in Europe when you've got planes landing from Brazil every half an hour?
[03:12:23.091 --> 03:12:32.557]  It's a complete myth that this mutant strain only exists in the United Kingdom, but apparently now we're Plague Island and that's okay to refer to Britain as Plague Island.
[03:12:33.338 --> 03:12:35.860]  Don't call it the China virus though, that means you're racist.
[03:12:37.741 --> 03:12:39.482]  Another headline here at Summit.News.
[03:12:40.188 --> 03:12:45.910]  Scientists and MPs ask, where is evidence of 70% more contagious mutant COVID?
[03:12:46.830 --> 03:13:04.896]  As London and the entire southeast of the UK was plunged into a fresh lockdown over the weekend, scores of countries have banned all travel to and from the UK, but scientists there are demanding to see any evidence that there is a 70% more contagious mutant strain of COVID, having not been shown anything by the government.
[03:13:05.276 --> 03:13:08.557]  They just announced it in a press conference and that's enough apparently!
[03:13:09.676 --> 03:13:19.718]  The Daily Mail reports Carl Hennigan, Professor of Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, has expressed scepticism over the 70% figure.
[03:13:20.798 --> 03:13:28.320]  He says, I've been doing this job for 25 years, I can tell you, you can't establish a quantifiable number in such a short time frame.
[03:13:28.820 --> 03:13:38.062]  They didn't even open it up to the other scientists, they just announced it in a press conference because they needed to get everyone under de facto house arrest right before Christmas.
[03:13:39.036 --> 03:14:01.167]  After having initially, of course, said that, you know, graciously giving us a four day period from the 23rd of October, I think it was, to the 27th, where we would be allowed, and we're so grateful, we would be allowed to meet with people from not one, but two other households.
[03:14:01.227 --> 03:14:06.350]  My God, can you imagine being allowed by the government to meet up with
[03:14:07.051 --> 03:14:09.112]  Family members from two different households.
[03:14:09.132 --> 03:14:13.913]  We were so graciously, graciously thankful.
[03:14:14.813 --> 03:14:16.074]  And now that's gone as well.
[03:14:16.334 --> 03:14:18.394]  Tier 4, you can't even meet with anyone.
[03:14:18.434 --> 03:14:19.755]  You're literally under house arrest.
[03:14:20.035 --> 03:14:21.475]  You can't leave the area.
[03:14:22.455 --> 03:14:25.516]  But people from Beijing and Shanghai, they can come in, they can do whatever they want.
[03:14:25.956 --> 03:14:26.957]  Borders are wide open.
[03:14:28.577 --> 03:14:35.199]  So Hannigan continued, speaking about this mutant strain which isn't new at all and has existed for at least eight months.
[03:14:35.947 --> 03:14:39.368]  He says, every expert is saying it's too early to draw such an inference.
[03:14:40.028 --> 03:14:46.009]  I would want to have very clear evidence rather than we think it's more transmissible so we can see if it is or not.
[03:14:46.729 --> 03:14:48.850]  He said, it's had massive implications.
[03:14:48.930 --> 03:14:50.750]  It's causing fear and panic.
[03:14:50.950 --> 03:14:53.030]  Yeah, that was the reason why they came out with it.
[03:14:53.671 --> 03:14:57.731]  But we should not be in this situation where the government is putting out data that is unquantifiable.
[03:14:58.972 --> 03:15:05.593]  They are fitting the data to the evidence, which is what they've done all along.
[03:15:07.216 --> 03:15:10.860]  Another top scientist calling out this mutant strain.
[03:15:11.280 --> 03:15:16.926]  RT reports top German virologist cast doubt on fears of new highly contagious UK Covid-19 strain.
[03:15:18.228 --> 03:15:23.313]  This is from Christian Drosten, the head of virology department of Berlin's Charite Center.
[03:15:24.229 --> 03:15:29.592]  He said suddenly there is this figure out there 70% and no one even knows what is meant by that.
[03:15:29.992 --> 03:15:37.155]  The virologist believes there is just not enough data to really say that the new strain is any more dangerous than the existing ones.
[03:15:37.496 --> 03:15:44.379]  But it doesn't matter what he says, doesn't matter what the other scientists say, they just announced it in a press conference and now because of this,
[03:15:45.450 --> 03:15:49.334]  We're going to be locked down until Easter or beyond.
[03:15:49.774 --> 03:15:54.819]  Lockdown 3.0, which is going to lead to lockdown 4.0 ad infinitum.
[03:15:55.220 --> 03:15:57.402]  It never ends because they don't want it to.
[03:15:57.982 --> 03:15:58.583]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:58.603 --> 03:15:59.123]  Summit.News.
[03:15:59.143 --> 03:15:59.604]  Don't go away.
[03:17:00.353 --> 03:17:02.514]  Winter Sun has been sold out for months.
[03:17:03.355 --> 03:17:04.356]  It's now back in stock.
[03:17:04.416 --> 03:17:07.578]  It's the highest quality vitamin D3 you're going to find anywhere.
[03:17:07.918 --> 03:17:12.521]  You take it under the tongue for maximum absorption or just put it in your mouth and drink it down.
[03:17:13.221 --> 03:17:18.545]  It's absolutely an essential vitamin, meaning if you don't have it and you have a deficiency from it, you will die.
[03:17:19.125 --> 03:17:20.526]  The system doesn't want you to know this.
[03:17:20.546 --> 03:17:27.849]  And they don't want you to know that they've lowered the allowance of what they claim you need every day to a level that makes you very, very sickly and easy to control.
[03:17:27.929 --> 03:17:35.433]  But now we have a winner's sum of vitamin D3 and vitamin K that helps it upload better and is also excellent for your immune system at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:17:35.813 --> 03:17:36.594]  Sold out for months.
[03:17:37.114 --> 03:17:41.477]  I'm still going to sell it at 50% off because everyone needs it.
[03:17:41.517 --> 03:17:47.622]  Get it for yourself, get it for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors, especially folks that work indoors and don't get any sun.
[03:17:48.042 --> 03:17:52.805]  It's absolutely critical to get your Winter Sun now available again at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:17:52.866 --> 03:17:55.988]  Again, Winter Sun at InfoWarStore.com is back in stock.
[03:17:58.777 --> 03:18:01.840]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[03:18:02.500 --> 03:18:04.562]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[03:18:05.342 --> 03:18:06.483]  Yes sir, yes sir.
[03:18:06.523 --> 03:18:13.409]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[03:18:14.029 --> 03:18:17.330]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[03:18:17.670 --> 03:18:26.173]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[03:18:26.193 --> 03:18:32.055]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old going on 20, thanks to this Info 4 Store products.
[03:18:32.115 --> 03:18:37.577]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night, so I'm doing what I can, brother.
[03:18:37.617 --> 03:18:41.959]  So what my contention is, why don't we start this new year off right?
[03:18:42.379 --> 03:18:48.406]  With everybody getting a couple bottles of Living Defense, now you gotta follow that up with the Micro ZX.
[03:18:48.566 --> 03:18:49.327]  I learned that.
[03:18:49.627 --> 03:18:51.809]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[03:18:52.190 --> 03:18:52.831]  We didn't know.
[03:18:52.851 --> 03:18:53.992]  We didn't screen your call.
[03:18:54.012 --> 03:18:54.773]  We had no idea.
[03:18:54.793 --> 03:18:58.477]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[03:18:58.537 --> 03:18:59.137]  Living Defense.
[03:18:59.177 --> 03:18:59.698]  Living Defense.
[03:19:04.788 --> 03:19:07.070]  The enemy has been forced out in the open.
[03:19:07.731 --> 03:19:09.592]  World government is here.
[03:19:10.313 --> 03:19:18.179]  And the system is publicly stealing this election from the biggest landslide and the biggest political realignment since 1776!
[03:19:21.673 --> 03:19:27.858]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or the free exercise thereof.
[03:19:28.218 --> 03:19:33.442]  Meaning, our forebearers did not have separation of church and state as they spread it.
[03:19:33.482 --> 03:19:37.965]  It means the state has no jurisdiction over any of us.
[03:19:46.403 --> 03:19:49.985]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[03:19:50.225 --> 03:19:52.747]  It was never the Republican Party's revolution.
[03:19:52.987 --> 03:19:55.749]  It was always our revolution!
[03:20:14.913 --> 03:20:22.018]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[03:20:24.119 --> 03:20:40.549]  We are back broadcasting live from what they are now referring to as Plague Island because we're all imprisoned and trapped within it and apparently it's all because of this mutant new strain of coronavirus that isn't new at all and in fact was in Brazil eight months ago.
[03:20:40.569 --> 03:20:41.450]  Headline,
[03:20:42.276 --> 03:20:46.079]  Reports UK infection rate lower than countries cutting it off.
[03:20:46.539 --> 03:20:49.762]  Mutant Covid was seen in Brazil eight months ago.
[03:20:50.102 --> 03:20:54.825]  And this is nothing more than xenophobia against Britain and against Brits.
[03:20:55.546 --> 03:21:10.457]  Despite nations all over the world beginning to isolate from the UK, banning travel to and from Britain, Britain not banning any travel whatsoever that's incoming from China and Brazil, and effectively cutting it off, the infection rate is lower there than several other countries.
[03:21:11.064 --> 03:21:16.126]  As noted by the Daily Mail, infection rates in Britain are still lower than in Sweden, Denmark, Croatia and Holland.
[03:21:17.107 --> 03:21:19.968]  Nevertheless, these countries are isolating themselves from the UK.
[03:21:20.449 --> 03:21:22.029]  Very xenophobic, very racist.
[03:21:22.730 --> 03:21:29.293]  After the government there hyped a mutant strain of Covid to justify another lockdown without presenting any evidence.
[03:21:29.773 --> 03:21:33.195]  And that's not me saying that, that's top virologists and scientists saying that.
[03:21:34.015 --> 03:21:36.776]  Footage has emerged of British travellers being detained in foreign airports.
[03:21:36.796 --> 03:21:37.977]  We talked about that before the break.
[03:21:38.905 --> 03:21:44.308]  Meanwhile, the British government has not closed its borders to any incoming flights at all.
[03:21:44.888 --> 03:21:51.411]  All these other countries have closed their borders, even though they've got literally higher coronavirus rates than the UK.
[03:21:52.652 --> 03:21:59.135]  Scientists working with the government in Britain also claim that the new supercharged strain was present in Brazil eight months ago.
[03:22:00.015 --> 03:22:06.919]  So even the scientists advising the British government, which is claiming this mutant strain is new, are saying it isn't new.
[03:22:08.129 --> 03:22:19.872]  Studies show the mutation called N501Y was spotted in the South American country in April before later rearing its head again in Australia and the United States.
[03:22:19.912 --> 03:22:24.134]  That's according to the London Telegraph and it's also across Europe.
[03:22:24.374 --> 03:22:29.515]  It's already in these same countries that are banning travel based on the fact that it's a new strain.
[03:22:29.555 --> 03:22:31.936]  When it isn't a new strain it's already throughout the world.
[03:22:32.779 --> 03:22:43.709]  The report further notes that leading scientific advisors explained the N501Y strain did not cause much alarm earlier in the year because it failed to rip through populations on its own.
[03:22:44.850 --> 03:22:49.394]  And yet they're telling us that it's 70% worse than the original COVID strain.
[03:22:50.717 --> 03:23:00.748]  The strain is thought to have been spreading in the UK since September, but only now, days before Christmas, and after Parliament has broken up for the holiday, has the Government spoken about it.
[03:23:00.868 --> 03:23:10.659]  And they did that, they sent all the MPs back home so they couldn't come back to Parliament, and challenged the Government, forced them into holding a vote on this new tier system.
[03:23:11.139 --> 03:23:15.322]  Because this tier system was introduced on the basis that Parliament would have a vote on it.
[03:23:15.682 --> 03:23:16.403]  Imagine that!
[03:23:16.963 --> 03:23:22.367]  Our own elected officials, our own elected MPs, having a say on law!
[03:23:23.028 --> 03:23:23.768]  Imagine that!
[03:23:23.788 --> 03:23:24.889]  It's crazy, right?
[03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:36.297]  But no, they all sent them packing, they sent them back home, then afterwards introduced this law on the hoof, on a whim, so it couldn't be challenged in Parliament.
[03:23:37.617 --> 03:23:45.341]  Scientists in Britain also state the hint to look for the N501Y came from scientists who were tracking this mutation in South Africa.
[03:23:45.381 --> 03:23:47.102]  So it was already in South Africa too.
[03:23:48.183 --> 03:23:50.004]  Both the British and South African variants.
[03:23:50.404 --> 03:23:53.906]  By the way, people from South Africa, they're totally welcome to come in.
[03:23:54.706 --> 03:23:59.729]  I've seen flights from South Africa landing at Heathrow too, where they have the same strain.
[03:24:00.129 --> 03:24:02.991]  But I can't travel 30 miles or I might be arrested.
[03:24:05.390 --> 03:24:07.571]  But appear to evolve independently of one another.
[03:24:07.711 --> 03:24:14.095]  South Africa's health minister suggested on Friday that the new strain present there seems to have a more severe effect on young people.
[03:24:14.435 --> 03:24:15.556]  But again, come on in!
[03:24:16.577 --> 03:24:19.618]  Scientists independent of the government are asking to see the evidence.
[03:24:19.658 --> 03:24:21.199]  We talked about that before the break.
[03:24:23.121 --> 03:24:26.302]  Professor Carl Hennigan said, I've been doing this job for 25 years.
[03:24:26.463 --> 03:24:32.026]  I can tell you, you can't establish a quantifiable number in such a short time frame.
[03:24:32.688 --> 03:24:33.668]  So it's all baloney.
[03:24:34.308 --> 03:24:38.110]  What's also baloney is the notion that police can even enforce any of this.
[03:24:38.890 --> 03:24:45.672]  We've seen polls, which I'm going to get into shortly, which show massive support for lockdown measures.
[03:24:46.352 --> 03:24:49.353]  The worse they get, the support seems to just grow.
[03:24:49.373 --> 03:24:57.635]  I don't know who they're asking in these polls, because anecdotally that's not what I'm seeing, witnessing or experiencing out in the real world.
[03:24:58.550 --> 03:25:02.433]  You go in the, you go in the barbers, you go in pubs when we were allowed to.
[03:25:03.154 --> 03:25:04.055]  You go in restaurants.
[03:25:04.735 --> 03:25:07.738]  Everybody's talking about this and everybody's speaking out against it.
[03:25:08.839 --> 03:25:16.125]  There was a woman in the pub literally telling half the pub how she works in an NHS hospital and they're completely empty.
[03:25:16.145 --> 03:25:19.147]  And we're going to get on to that too.
[03:25:19.347 --> 03:25:23.631]  But here's a headline, UK police, there are no powers to enforce Christmas travel ban.
[03:25:24.761 --> 03:25:35.371]  Police in the UK have admitted they have no legal authority to enforce a travel ban in and out of London and the South East after the government instituted a third lockdown, cancelling Christmas for millions of people.
[03:25:36.472 --> 03:25:50.144]  The London Telegraph reports, officials from the Police Federation say officers do not have the power to stop people travelling to, or to stop cars and check if citizens are unlawfully visiting relatives and friends for Christmas.
[03:25:50.709 --> 03:26:07.377]  Now, of course, we had Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, come out last week and say police should enforce these measures, which would bring the prospect of them literally knocking on people's doors on Christmas Day to see if there were too many people gathering in one place.
[03:26:07.397 --> 03:26:11.538]  So the government has literally encouraged people to spy on each other, to snitch on each other.
[03:26:11.999 --> 03:26:17.081]  And yet the police force itself across the country is saying they're not going to enforce it because they can't.
[03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:22.111]  This police chief said, it's heavily reliant on public compliance.
[03:26:22.131 --> 03:26:24.952]  The restriction isn't on travelling, it's on leaving the house.
[03:26:25.873 --> 03:26:27.754]  That's what a police source told The Telegraph.
[03:26:28.434 --> 03:26:34.918]  He said, the more reasonable excuses there are, the more there will be opportunities to claim an exemption where, in truth, one doesn't exist.
[03:26:34.998 --> 03:26:40.662]  Because again, in the law, if they challenge you and say, why are you outside your house, pleb?
[03:26:41.622 --> 03:26:43.824]  Legally, you're not obliged to tell them.
[03:26:44.724 --> 03:26:46.145]  So it's completely toothless.
[03:26:47.406 --> 03:26:52.508]  In addition, it's only legal for police to stop motorists if they have witnessed a traffic violation.
[03:26:52.968 --> 03:27:06.474]  Now, that being said, we have seen videos, there was one a couple of weeks ago, where it was an Elvis impersonator, literally in his home, on his own, doing karaoke to an Elvis song.
[03:27:07.374 --> 03:27:09.015]  His back is turned to the door.
[03:27:09.395 --> 03:27:10.716]  The police bust in.
[03:27:11.136 --> 03:27:12.316]  He thinks he's being robbed.
[03:27:12.356 --> 03:27:13.557]  He thinks it's an intruder.
[03:27:13.617 --> 03:27:15.838]  He literally goes and tries to attack the police.
[03:27:16.750 --> 03:27:21.815]  Obviously because one of his neighbours snitched on him because the music was too loud.
[03:27:22.175 --> 03:27:23.857]  So you are going to get a lot of that.
[03:27:23.877 --> 03:27:34.167]  You're going to get a lot of curtain twitches over the Christmas and New Year period reporting their neighbours to the police because the government literally encouraged them to do that.
[03:27:35.768 --> 03:27:38.651]  There you see the Elvis impersonator, the Covid
[03:27:39.594 --> 03:27:44.155]  Police force, the COVID inspectors just burst into his house, no warrant whatsoever.
[03:27:44.476 --> 03:27:48.557]  He tries to attack them, not realizing that it's the police and not an intruder.
[03:27:49.057 --> 03:27:51.618]  And you're going to see more of that over the next week.
[03:27:52.338 --> 03:27:53.738]  Because you're going to have New Year's Eve.
[03:27:54.179 --> 03:27:57.560]  They've banned, you know, all the pubs are closed for tens of millions of people.
[03:27:58.220 --> 03:28:01.521]  People being told they're not allowed to gather, even with their own friends and family.
[03:28:01.761 --> 03:28:03.822]  Do you really think they're going to abide by that?
[03:28:03.882 --> 03:28:07.963]  In fact, there was a poll a few weeks ago, or in fact, I think it was a couple of months ago,
[03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:23.325]  Which found that although the vast majority of people agree, in the polls they say they consent to these lockdown measures, when they were asked to be honest about if they've actually complied with them personally, only 18% said they had.
[03:28:24.085 --> 03:28:26.026]  So of course there's mass non-compliance.
[03:28:26.386 --> 03:28:37.690]  Of course you're going to get people, in their dozens in some cases, or at least groups of 10-15 people, going to each other's houses on New Year's Eve for massive
[03:28:38.038 --> 03:28:42.503]  House parties, now the question remains, are the police going to break those up?
[03:28:42.843 --> 03:28:54.275]  Because you can be damn sure that there are going to be thousands upon thousands of house parties across the country on New Year's Eve, in violation of this ridiculous, ludicrous law.
[03:28:54.295 --> 03:28:56.517]  Will the police stop?
[03:30:00.103 --> 03:30:02.024]  Now let's go to Old Dude in Missouri.
[03:30:02.144 --> 03:30:03.065]  Old Dude, thanks for holding.
[03:30:03.085 --> 03:30:03.345]  Go ahead.
[03:30:03.465 --> 03:30:05.806]  First off, man, hey, I just want to thank you for what you've done.
[03:30:05.846 --> 03:30:06.907]  I know you hear that a lot.
[03:30:06.947 --> 03:30:09.828]  You've been very influential in a lot of people's lives.
[03:30:10.489 --> 03:30:15.451]  Second thing I want to say is the bodies and the X2 is amazing.
[03:30:15.671 --> 03:30:16.872]  I played football in college.
[03:30:16.952 --> 03:30:17.912]  I had some injuries.
[03:30:18.173 --> 03:30:21.855]  And the bodies allows me to do things that most people my age just can't do.
[03:30:22.095 --> 03:30:24.396]  I mean, I went out and played flag football here a few weeks ago.
[03:30:24.816 --> 03:30:28.018]  And was running with guys that were in their early 20s and I'm almost 40.
[03:30:28.539 --> 03:30:29.860]  So the products are awesome.
[03:30:30.100 --> 03:30:37.425]  As far as what Donald Trump could do is make a call out to all local law enforcement and militias to organize all able-bodied patriots.
[03:30:37.585 --> 03:30:44.190]  And now I realize he would be signaling to the people who have control over things in the economy and they could take some steps.
[03:30:44.690 --> 03:30:50.735]  But if we can organize together, I feel like that could be an effective thing that we could do to keep our own local communities safe.
[03:30:51.095 --> 03:30:51.735]  That's right, brother.
[03:30:51.836 --> 03:30:54.998]  It is a spiritual war, and we see the enemy attacking.
[03:30:55.578 --> 03:30:57.960]  That's because the enemy knows it's in trouble.
[03:30:58.020 --> 03:30:59.181]  It's been forced out in the open.
[03:30:59.441 --> 03:31:03.383]  So as negative as this is at one level, I see it as very, very positive at others.
[03:31:04.084 --> 03:31:09.808]  So people need to organize, and they need to stand on the foundation of reality that God has provided us.
[03:31:10.268 --> 03:31:23.147]  Through Jesus Christ and the people who brought the message forth to the world and understand that we have God on our side because the literal essence of his truth is written in his words and communicated to humanity.
[03:31:35.456 --> 03:31:43.323]  Not David Rockefeller, not Bill Gates, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, but Jesus Christ is King!
[03:31:45.785 --> 03:31:51.550]  And God gave us and rose up Donald Trump to stand against the enemy and draw out the enemy.
[03:31:51.931 --> 03:31:59.277]  So as dark as some of these days are, understand this is the beginning of the great revival before the Antichrist comes!
[03:32:00.322 --> 03:32:01.744]  Hello, useless eaters.
[03:32:02.245 --> 03:32:13.681]  As your unqualified, non-elected global human health overlord, I'd like to take this opportunity to flaunt my position of power and influence over society and share some of my plans for you and your future.
[03:32:14.262 --> 03:32:16.806]  When I amassed my fortune in computer software,
[03:32:16.926 --> 03:32:24.531]  I demonstrated that I was willing to lie, steal code, cheat my partners, and exercise monopolistic control to destroy my competitors.
[03:32:25.172 --> 03:32:28.754]  Now that I've retired, I can rebrand myself as a humanitarian.
[03:32:29.134 --> 03:32:40.302]  With my for-profit foundation MassGrading as a charity, I can advocate for population reduction and sponsor mass human experiments with unproven vaccines in vulnerable populations.
[03:32:40.842 --> 03:32:50.908]  Like my father, a powerful banker, eugenicist, and Rockefeller crony himself, it's always been my ambition to decide who lives and, more importantly, how many have to die.
[03:32:51.208 --> 03:32:59.514]  Whether it's under the guise of climate change or world health, it's really all about controlling and culling the human herd for fun and profit.
[03:33:02.095 --> 03:33:07.999]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.810 --> 03:33:19.216]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:22.460 --> 03:33:30.670]  So in the United Kingdom we have officially now internal borders while the external borders remain wide open.
[03:33:31.211 --> 03:33:32.332]  And all for what?
[03:33:33.570 --> 03:33:39.631]  The amount of deaths year-on-year in the United Kingdom is roughly the same as it's been for the past 5-10 years.
[03:33:40.191 --> 03:33:47.912]  In fact, the 2017-18 flu season claimed more deaths year-on-year than this current season, 2019-2020.
[03:33:47.932 --> 03:33:52.433]  Now we have this headline out of the Mail Online.
[03:33:52.533 --> 03:33:56.634]  Are hospitals really creaking under the strain of Covid before Christmas?
[03:33:56.694 --> 03:34:02.695]  The hospitals are emptier right now compared to this same time last year.
[03:34:04.031 --> 03:34:09.514]  Last year they were 90% full, now they're only 85% full.
[03:34:10.335 --> 03:34:23.703]  The article states, and this is based on official data by the way, NHS data still shows hospitals to be quieter than they were this time last year, compared to this time last year, amid the looming threat of a third national lockdown in the new year.
[03:34:24.403 --> 03:34:32.448]  Despite the health service having more breathing room than 12 months ago, Boris Johnson refused to rule out another national shutdown, and that's going to happen by the way.
[03:34:33.732 --> 03:34:36.213]  January, the whole country is going to be shut down again.
[03:34:36.973 --> 03:34:48.559]  Figures show there were 15,465 people in hospital with Covid in England on December 16th, compared to 18,974 on the worst day in spring.
[03:34:49.159 --> 03:34:51.280]  November's lockdown effects appear to have worn off.
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:56.682]  Oh yeah, there were more infections before the lockdown than after the lockdown.
[03:34:56.702 --> 03:34:59.423]  Sorry, after the lockdown than before the lockdown in London.
[03:34:59.723 --> 03:35:00.864]  The lockdown didn't work,
[03:35:01.593 --> 03:35:02.634]  So now we have another one.
[03:35:03.014 --> 03:35:03.795]  And then another one.
[03:35:04.155 --> 03:35:04.876]  And then another one.
[03:35:04.936 --> 03:35:06.417]  Because these lockdowns work so well.
[03:35:07.978 --> 03:35:09.019]  Article continues.
[03:35:10.220 --> 03:35:13.603]  In more confirmation, the number 10 is struggling to keep a lid on the epidemic.
[03:35:13.643 --> 03:35:18.727]  SAGE today claimed Britain's COVID-19 reproduction R-rate is definitely above 1 again.
[03:35:19.188 --> 03:35:24.893]  But statistics suggest the health service is overall coping better with its workload than it did last winter.
[03:35:25.613 --> 03:35:27.635]  Before this pandemic was even a thing.
[03:35:28.968 --> 03:35:31.390]  A greater proportion of ward beds are free.
[03:35:31.930 --> 03:35:33.992]  Intensive care units have more room.
[03:35:34.452 --> 03:35:38.935]  And A&E departments aren't yet turning ambulances away more often than usual.
[03:35:39.956 --> 03:35:44.039]  With the exception of a bad day at one NHS trust in the Midlands.
[03:35:44.679 --> 03:35:50.724]  Meanwhile, of course, they're cancelling all the both elective procedures and serious treatments
[03:35:51.684 --> 03:36:04.009]  Cancers and the like, so people aren't getting access to their cancer treatments, either because they're afraid to go into the hospitals because they've been so terrified by the mainstream media, or because those treatments, those operations are being cancelled.
[03:36:04.909 --> 03:36:06.630]  So more excess deaths from that.
[03:36:06.670 --> 03:36:09.191]  They don't even take that into account when they make these policies.
[03:36:10.351 --> 03:36:17.614]  And the occupancy figure does not take into account bolstered capacity at the mothballed Nightingale Hospitals, of course.
[03:36:18.214 --> 03:36:19.695]  Just like you had the Navy ship
[03:36:20.484 --> 03:36:28.786]  Cruising into New York at the height of the pandemic back in spring, which was almost immediately turned away because they didn't need it.
[03:36:29.346 --> 03:36:33.206]  We had all these temporary Nightingale hospitals built in the United Kingdom.
[03:36:34.767 --> 03:36:39.167]  And almost to every single one of them, they were not used.
[03:36:40.108 --> 03:36:45.088]  The NHS is also benefiting from record levels of staff, so they're completely not overwhelmed.
[03:36:46.189 --> 03:36:47.869]  There's a graph here on this article
[03:36:48.911 --> 03:36:50.991]  It says, how does NHS pressure compare to 2019?
[03:36:52.952 --> 03:36:57.373]  Average percentage of beds occupied in 2019, December last year, 94.9%.
[03:36:58.773 --> 03:37:01.974]  Right now, 2020, 89%.
[03:37:04.454 --> 03:37:06.095]  So it's less occupancy.
[03:37:06.115 --> 03:37:09.795]  The hospitals are emptier right now than they were last year.
[03:37:09.815 --> 03:37:17.257]  And yet we're being presented with this hysterical notion that hospitals are being overwhelmed, that people are going to be dying in corridors.
[03:37:18.104 --> 03:37:21.405]  It's simply not happening.
[03:37:21.425 --> 03:37:25.307]  The percentage of intensive care beds full.
[03:37:25.447 --> 03:37:28.609]  In 2019, December, this time last year, it was 83.8%.
[03:37:29.089 --> 03:37:33.891]  Right now, 2020, it's only 75%.
[03:37:34.871 --> 03:37:38.633]  And those numbers are direct from the NHS.
[03:37:41.014 --> 03:37:45.756]  By the way, somebody worked it out on lockdownsceptics.org, which is an excellent website tracking all this.
[03:37:46.997 --> 03:38:04.423]  That the chances of you, or at least if you live in the United Kingdom, it's probably similar in the United States, the chances of you being infected with COVID, passing it on to somebody else and then dying from it, you know, this whole thing about, oh, you're so irresponsible for killing granny.
[03:38:05.163 --> 03:38:14.406]  The chances of that happening, somebody worked out, and I'm going to go through the numbers here, are the same chances of you winning the lottery.
[03:38:15.067 --> 03:38:16.347]  It's that rare.
[03:38:18.042 --> 03:38:22.265]  First of all, given that you have no symptoms, what are the chances that you're infected with COVID?
[03:38:23.486 --> 03:38:29.351]  The Office of National Statistics in the UK estimates this to be 1 in 115, or 0.87%.
[03:38:30.411 --> 03:38:37.777]  Now, imagining you are infected but you don't have any symptoms, what's the probability you will infect somebody else with COVID?
[03:38:38.457 --> 03:38:40.199]  Recent studies show this is around 0.7%.
[03:38:42.921 --> 03:38:52.203]  So if we multiply the probability of these two events, we can calculate the likelihood of you A, being infected, and B, passing that infection on without symptoms.
[03:38:52.263 --> 03:38:53.603]  This gives a figure of 0.006%.
[03:38:56.924 --> 03:39:05.026]  To put that figure into context, it's roughly the same as your chance of dying in a car crash over the course of any given year.
[03:39:05.706 --> 03:39:06.786]  Incredibly rare.
[03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:11.872]  But if you infect someone, this doesn't mean they're going to end up dying of COVID pneumonia.
[03:39:11.932 --> 03:39:12.933]  Far from it, in fact.
[03:39:13.673 --> 03:39:20.858]  There's a lot of debate regarding the IFR of SARS-CoV-2, but the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine puts it at roughly 0.5%.
[03:39:21.418 --> 03:39:28.142]  Now, if we multiply the chance of infecting another person without symptoms by the fatality rate,
[03:39:28.795 --> 03:39:41.284]  We can estimate that the risk of killing one of your relatives is roughly, and bear with me here, 0.000003%, or one in three million.
[03:39:41.845 --> 03:39:42.625]  That's the risk.
[03:39:43.686 --> 03:39:45.107]  Obviously, there are a lot of caveats.
[03:39:45.647 --> 03:39:49.290]  If one of your relatives is very old and very ill, then that's going to be a higher risk.
[03:39:50.271 --> 03:39:53.253]  If they're relatively healthy, it's going to be a lower risk.
[03:39:54.261 --> 03:39:56.984]  But there's another caveat, and that is PCR tests.
[03:39:57.024 --> 03:39:58.986]  Of course, notoriously unreliable.
[03:39:59.647 --> 03:40:05.693]  The first number we use in the number of infected individuals in the UK is based on positive PCR results.
[03:40:06.314 --> 03:40:11.139]  It's possible that only 3% of these positive results are actually accurate.
[03:40:11.780 --> 03:40:16.225]  Which means the risk of a person killing a relative without any discernible coronavirus symptoms
[03:40:17.125 --> 03:40:21.087]  May well be as low as 1 in 30 million.
[03:40:21.667 --> 03:40:26.110]  The same sort of likelihood of you winning the National Lottery.
[03:40:28.251 --> 03:40:31.433]  Continues, clearly it's for individuals to assess the risk for themselves.
[03:40:32.433 --> 03:40:36.135]  But they should do so in the knowledge of how big those risks actually are.
[03:40:36.235 --> 03:40:43.059]  And when you boil down the numbers, when you crunch the numbers, it's the same risk as you winning the National Lottery.
[03:40:44.494 --> 03:41:05.212]  So you'd think, given those statistics, given the fact that hospital beds are emptier than they were at this time last year, given the fact that this whole hysteria about this new mutant strain of Covid is complete bonk because it's been around for eight months, you'd think the population would temper their enthusiasm for draconian police state de facto house arrest lockdowns,
[03:41:06.883 --> 03:41:07.783]  And that's not the case.
[03:41:08.164 --> 03:41:09.985]  In fact, they support them even more.
[03:41:10.405 --> 03:41:29.874]  Now, whether you can believe these polls or not, whether you think it's people telling the pollsters what they think they want to hear, maybe whether you think it's these people being afraid of being found out of going public with not supporting this Covid lockdown because they're so terrified of being publicly cancelled on social media or whatever,
[03:41:32.378 --> 03:41:38.442]  Guido Falk's blog reports three quarters of Britain support the creation of the new tier 4 coronavirus restrictions.
[03:41:38.462 --> 03:41:39.743]  This is a poll by YouGov.
[03:41:40.804 --> 03:41:49.430]  By 61 to 33, Brits think the government has handled the issue of Christmas coronavirus rules badly, but then when they ask them if they support them,
[03:41:51.132 --> 03:41:56.213]  The general population found that 74% of the population supported them.
[03:41:56.253 --> 03:42:03.576]  So literally 74% of people, apparently if you believe these polls, don't want to see their family members at Christmas.
[03:42:03.856 --> 03:42:06.376]  They want even harsher lockdowns.
[03:42:06.816 --> 03:42:09.817]  If you can believe that, I've got a bridge to sell you.
[03:42:10.638 --> 03:42:12.178]  Because as I said, anecdotally,
[03:42:12.731 --> 03:42:25.900]  All I hear in the real world, all I hear on social media, all I read on the comments below all these major articles on major news websites, is that there's a massive backlash against these measures.
[03:42:26.520 --> 03:42:42.070]  And surely that's going to expand now, given that not only have the Christmases of millions and millions of people who are planning to travel abroad to see their family members being ruined, completely ruined, now they're not even going to get their refunds from flight operators
[03:42:42.984 --> 03:42:45.725]  Because they've said we're not cancelling their flights.
[03:42:46.085 --> 03:42:52.508]  We're still going to operate the flights, even though there are literally like two Spaniards on one flight flying home.
[03:42:52.588 --> 03:42:55.470]  They're allowed to enter Spain, obviously, but we're not.
[03:42:56.170 --> 03:42:57.711]  Is that really believable?
[03:42:57.751 --> 03:42:58.531]  In fact, don't go away.
[03:43:00.543 --> 03:43:04.544]  All right, well, as we've been telling you, frontline workers are among the first to receive the vaccine.
[03:43:04.604 --> 03:43:10.846]  And this morning, we're joined by two of them who are going to get their vaccinations live right now.
[03:43:11.086 --> 03:43:22.670]  First of all, I would say that this is the culmination of a scientific process that's been rigorous, that's been time-tested, and Americans need to feel comfortable with this notion that this is a safe and effective vaccine.
[03:43:22.690 --> 03:43:28.632]  So I'm really thrilled and privileged to join my colleague, Dr. Fagley, to lead by example.
[03:43:29.933 --> 03:43:36.218]  As we started taking care of these patients at the very beginning, we really didn't have a great idea of what we were up against necessarily.
[03:43:36.398 --> 03:43:55.253]  Wuhan scientists took the North Carolina SARS with gain-of-function, which is already a biological warfare weapon, and they took the technology here behind this well-developed SARS HIV weapon
[03:43:57.057 --> 03:44:21.658]  And they all brought it back to the Wuhan BSL-4 and tried to DNA genetically engineer it into a chimera, into a biological warfare weapon involving the coronavirus, the HIV virus, and gain-of-function.
[03:44:22.038 --> 03:44:25.321]  Gain-of-function work can only be done safely
[03:44:26.053 --> 03:44:31.117]  In a BSL-4 or a BSL-3 facility.
[03:44:31.778 --> 03:44:48.311]  So I think clearly this is the smoking gun and there is no legitimate scientific or medical use for gain-of-function technology, DNA technology on biowarfare.
[03:44:48.431 --> 03:44:51.253]  So there's no excuse that it's a vaccine test that got out?
[03:44:52.253 --> 03:44:52.913]  That's baloney.
[03:44:53.213 --> 03:44:58.935]  This is clearly an offensive biological warfare agent.
[03:44:59.495 --> 03:45:02.996]  As time has gone on, we've obviously gotten more familiar with caring for these patients.
[03:45:04.276 --> 03:45:12.939]  But even after the vaccine, I don't know that things are really going to change all that much in terms of... The only way we'll get completely back to normal
[03:45:13.719 --> 03:45:29.606]  Is by having, maybe not the first generation vaccines, but eventually a vaccine that is super effective and that a lot of the people take and that we get the disease eliminated on a global basis.
[03:45:31.047 --> 03:45:34.888]  Just so everybody at home knows, we're going to have Nurse Allison come out now.
[03:45:34.988 --> 03:45:36.769]  She'll administer the vaccine.
[03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:40.851]  So for the people who are getting this Pfizer vaccine, what can they expect?
[03:45:41.417 --> 03:45:45.260]  You know, we're expecting that it'll probably be something similar to the flu shot.
[03:45:45.280 --> 03:45:49.384]  You know, there'll be a little bit of local discomfort, just like any time you get any vaccine.
[03:45:49.904 --> 03:45:52.146]  I love to sew and crochet.
[03:45:52.547 --> 03:45:53.668]  I can't do that now.
[03:45:53.688 --> 03:45:55.629]  I can't even read.
[03:45:56.570 --> 03:45:58.272]  That flu shot did me in.
[03:45:59.022 --> 03:46:01.263]  Some folks may have symptoms, some folks may not.
[03:46:01.583 --> 03:46:07.427]  You know, feel like we have a little bit of a reaction to just about any other type of shot.
[03:46:07.907 --> 03:46:12.429]  All of my staff, we are excited to get the vaccine.
[03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:18.893]  You know, it's really... I'm sorry, I'm feeling really dizzy.
[03:46:23.956 --> 03:46:24.336]  I'm sorry.
[03:46:33.310 --> 03:46:36.293]  This vaccine, Craig, is the only way out of this pandemic.
[03:46:36.713 --> 03:46:37.634]  It's broadly safe.
[03:46:37.874 --> 03:46:41.058]  We're going to have clarity on that question, guys, in the next two to four weeks.
[03:46:41.418 --> 03:46:43.460]  And I think that's going to be really important for the American people.
[03:46:47.624 --> 03:46:50.187]  Hope you're feeling some hope.
[03:46:50.407 --> 03:46:51.908]  And they got Hello Kitty Band-Aids.
[03:46:52.089 --> 03:46:53.971]  I mean, the whole—it's even better, you know.
[03:47:02.324 --> 03:47:08.270]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:16.958 --> 03:47:24.486]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:28.248 --> 03:47:39.090]  So let's turn our attention to this coronavirus vaccine, which apparently is completely fine when it comes to tackling all these hundreds of other new, new mutant strains of coronavirus.
[03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:40.991]  We have to lock down for that.
[03:47:41.031 --> 03:47:42.111]  We have to be under house arrest.
[03:47:42.131 --> 03:47:43.371]  But don't worry about the vaccine.
[03:47:43.391 --> 03:47:45.072]  It's not going to affect the vaccine.
[03:47:46.332 --> 03:47:49.332]  Well, now people have been researching more into vaccine reactions.
[03:47:49.372 --> 03:47:56.694]  Of course, you saw the video a couple of days ago of the nurse receiving a vaccine and basically passing out within two minutes.
[03:47:57.580 --> 03:48:09.367]  Well now the CDC has, and this was again posted on lockdownsceptics.org, the CDC has produced a document documenting the side effects of the mRNA Covid vaccine.
[03:48:09.387 --> 03:48:16.691]  It says in frequent cases of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, have been reported already.
[03:48:17.332 --> 03:48:25.456]  However, a more interesting figure is to be found further down in the presentation in a table entitled v-safe active surveillance for Covid-19 vaccines.
[03:48:27.327 --> 03:48:38.416]  It says out of the 112,807 doses administered, 3,150 experienced what they call a, quote, health impact event.
[03:48:39.397 --> 03:48:52.148]  Described above by the CDC as, quote, unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or healthcare professional, that's about 2.8% of recipients.
[03:48:52.228 --> 03:48:53.469]  Now, we're not arguing that
[03:48:54.418 --> 03:48:59.263]  Adverse reactions to vaccines in small numbers on a routine thing.
[03:49:01.025 --> 03:49:16.501]  Problem is, we're being told that we have to remain under lockdown, remain under house arrest, we're banned from travelling internally in our own country, we're banned from travelling abroad, so as not to overwhelm the NHS, so as not to overwhelm the hospitals.
[03:49:18.231 --> 03:49:38.884]  Problem being, if the UK government's declared target of vaccinating approximately 25 million people in priority groups is met and the proportion remains stable, that 2.8% figure of adverse vaccine reactions in the UK alone, obviously much higher numbers in the United States,
[03:49:40.109 --> 03:49:48.397]  Could mean around 700,000 people potentially requiring some kind of medical care post-vaccination.
[03:49:49.177 --> 03:49:53.281]  And they ask the question, isn't mass vaccination supposed to protect the NHS?
[03:49:54.462 --> 03:50:05.793]  So we're being told that hospitals are being overwhelmed, that there's going to be a nightmare onslaught of new cases, people dying in the corridors, and yet by their own numbers this vaccine
[03:50:06.377 --> 03:50:13.919]  And the adverse reactions to it are going to create 700,000 people requiring medical attention.
[03:50:14.219 --> 03:50:17.220]  Another thing that doesn't quite add up.
[03:50:18.340 --> 03:50:19.981]  Meanwhile, let's get into masks.
[03:50:21.221 --> 03:50:34.945]  Have you ever noticed, by the way, and today especially, out in the park I see more people wearing masks outside, even though there's literally no law in the United Kingdom that says they have to do that.
[03:50:35.859 --> 03:50:39.522]  More people seem to have swallowed the blue pill and they're wearing masks.
[03:50:40.302 --> 03:50:44.326]  These people tend to look very serious, very righteous.
[03:50:44.426 --> 03:50:45.366]  They're good people.
[03:50:46.047 --> 03:50:50.330]  They also appear to look like they've got a stick up their backside.
[03:50:51.171 --> 03:50:54.453]  And that was evidenced once more again with this story yesterday.
[03:50:56.255 --> 03:50:59.577]  Leftists ridiculed for bragging about wearing two face masks.
[03:51:00.758 --> 03:51:02.860]  Bid for Twitter clout goes horribly wrong.
[03:51:03.379 --> 03:51:18.883]  Now, of course, as is standard at this point, as soon as they started gaining attention, the individual in question, don't know whether he deleted his original tweet or blocked me for a start, but he put his account on lockdown, so you can't even see if his original tweet is still there.
[03:51:19.183 --> 03:51:21.823]  Thankfully, I screenshotted it, knowing that that would happen.
[03:51:23.004 --> 03:51:28.045]  And this was a leftist who bragged about wearing not one, but two face masks.
[03:51:28.105 --> 03:51:33.046]  He said, quote, taking no chances queue at Waitrose today, which is a supermarket in England,
[03:51:33.820 --> 03:51:37.121]  Two masks, N95 and surgical.
[03:51:38.341 --> 03:51:41.763]  And this is a guy who has pro-EU remain in his bio.
[03:51:42.263 --> 03:51:44.644]  Surprisingly, doesn't have his pronouns in his bio.
[03:51:45.744 --> 03:52:00.989]  But of course, by trying to virtue signal for internet clout by graciously wearing two face masks to show that he's such a good, responsible citizen, he only proved that the first face mask, according to his own rules here, doesn't work.
[03:52:01.835 --> 03:52:06.458]  If the first one, if you're wearing two, then that only shows that the first one doesn't work.
[03:52:06.499 --> 03:52:07.499]  So what's the point?
[03:52:08.140 --> 03:52:11.782]  Of course, great merriment was had at his expense.
[03:52:13.063 --> 03:52:14.745]  And he panicked and shut down his account.
[03:52:15.505 --> 03:52:24.692]  By the way, his tweet after that said that he would not be responding to what he called right-wing snowflakes.
[03:52:25.387 --> 03:52:30.489]  He said, quote, they seem to be making the mistake of thinking that I give an S-H-I-T what they think.
[03:52:31.029 --> 03:52:37.051]  He then proceeded to spend the rest of the day responding on Twitter to right wing snowflakes.
[03:52:38.131 --> 03:52:43.293]  And this ties into a very important article, which is up on The Blaze entitled Horowitz.
[03:52:43.973 --> 03:52:47.554]  Comprehensive analysis of 50 states shows greater spread
[03:52:48.058 --> 03:52:50.000]  With mask mandates.
[03:52:50.080 --> 03:52:55.844]  Yes, there are more coronavirus cases in states in America where they mandated masks.
[03:52:57.126 --> 03:53:06.433]  He writes, for months we've been lectured by the political elites that masks, that cases of coronavirus are spreading too quickly and that we must wear masks to stop the spread.
[03:53:07.094 --> 03:53:17.002]  The obvious fault with their act of desperation is that they can no longer mask the fact that most parts of the country have already been fully masked for months, long before the ubiquitous spread this fall.
[03:53:18.055 --> 03:53:19.656]  And you see this in European countries.
[03:53:20.256 --> 03:53:27.218]  In Spain, Italy, France, as soon as they mandated the wearing of masks, both indoors and outdoors, coronavirus cases shot way up.
[03:53:28.919 --> 03:53:44.524]  Continues researchers at rationalground.com, a clearinghouse of COVID-19 data, trends run by a grassroots group of data analysts, computer scientists and actuaries, did an analysis of all 50 states, divided by those that had mask mandates and those that did not.
[03:53:45.942 --> 03:53:52.247]  Justin Hart, co-founder of the website, posted the results in a Twitter thread and shared with me the data analysis.
[03:53:52.267 --> 03:54:05.757]  It says they studied the number of cases over a 229-day period from May 1st through December 15th and divided the results of the two study groups by days with mask mandates and days without mask mandates.
[03:54:06.278 --> 03:54:14.784]  The non-mandate data group includes both states that never had a mandate and those that did at some point, but data set included only the days they did not have a mask mandate.
[03:54:15.677 --> 03:54:16.377]  The results.
[03:54:17.798 --> 03:54:32.242]  When comparing states with mandates versus those without, or periods of times within a state with a mandate versus without, there is absolutely no evidence that the mass mandate worked to slow the spread one iota.
[03:54:34.062 --> 03:54:38.943]  In total, in the states that had a mandate in effect, there were 9,605,000 confirmed COVID cases over 5,907 days.
[03:54:45.433 --> 03:54:48.134]  An average of 27 cases per 100,000 per day.
[03:54:48.774 --> 03:54:57.237]  When states did not have a statewide order, which includes the states that never had them, and the period of time masking states did not have the mandate in place, there were 5,781,000 cases over 5,700 days.
[03:54:57.257 --> 03:54:58.718]  Averaging 17 cases per 100,000 people per day.
[03:55:06.192 --> 03:55:10.093]  The reverse correlation between periods of masking and non-masking is remarkable.
[03:55:10.393 --> 03:55:15.995]  So in the states where they did not mandate masks, they had fewer coronavirus cases.
[03:55:16.255 --> 03:55:17.535]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:55:18.095 --> 03:55:20.256]  But again, you're a bad person if you don't wear one.
[03:55:20.836 --> 03:55:22.557]  Maybe you need to wear two now.
[03:55:23.457 --> 03:55:25.277]  Maybe you need to wear a full gas mask.
[03:55:25.337 --> 03:55:27.338]  Maybe you even need to wear a full hazmat suit.
[03:55:27.958 --> 03:55:34.220]  And actually, I'm probably going to commission a poll, because I commissioned a poll
[03:55:35.146 --> 03:55:46.833]  I think it was back in 2013, during the whole TSA debacle, which asked Americans if they would submit to a full-body cavity search in order to be allowed to fly.
[03:55:47.553 --> 03:55:50.635]  This was in 2013, I believe, 2012 or 2013.
[03:55:51.436 --> 03:56:01.902]  The result of the poll was that almost a third of Americans said that they would submit to a full-body TSA cavity search, that's basically an anal probe, not to get too graphic, in order to fly.
[03:56:02.462 --> 03:56:03.423]  So I'm going to do a poll
[03:56:04.585 --> 03:56:17.329]  Asking people in the United Kingdom, where apparently we have such massive compliance, if you believe the polls already put out, what level of imposition on their liberties, on their dignity, are they willing to undergo?
[03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:18.569]  Are they willing to accept?
[03:56:18.589 --> 03:56:22.530]  Are they willing to tolerate in order to go about their lives?
[03:56:23.051 --> 03:56:30.713]  And I'm deliberately, if a polling agency accepts this, because they're all grossly politicized, so many of them won't even have anything to do with me,
[03:56:31.454 --> 03:56:35.016]  What level of imposition, what level of lockdown measures will people accept?
[03:56:35.416 --> 03:56:41.519]  Will they accept, for example, the government telling them they're not allowed to go near their own window?
[03:56:42.380 --> 03:56:48.543]  Will they accept the government telling them they have to wear full hazmat suits to leave their own home?
[03:56:48.563 --> 03:56:56.447]  It's going to be very interesting as to the level, the percentage of compliance of people who accept those measures.
[03:56:56.567 --> 03:56:59.789]  And that's hopefully going to be happening here in the next couple of weeks.
[03:57:00.600 --> 03:57:02.045]  Finally, we have a raft of stories.
[03:57:02.125 --> 03:57:06.056]  French law would ban people who don't get Covid vaccine from using public transport.
[03:57:06.894 --> 03:57:21.682]  Thankfully there's massive backlash from all the opposition politicians in France at what they're now calling a health dictatorship because of this new law that would literally ban people who don't have the vaccine from using public transport, from visiting venues.
[03:57:22.222 --> 03:57:30.807]  And in Germany, German geneticists says people who refuse Covid vaccine should be denied medical treatment, literally saying that if they need
[03:57:31.387 --> 03:57:35.771]  Ventilators, if they need emergency medical treatment, it should be denied.
[03:57:35.791 --> 03:57:39.655]  We also have British government contracts firms to make Covid freedom passports.
[03:57:39.735 --> 03:57:40.816]  Initially they denied it.
[03:57:41.136 --> 03:57:45.099]  Now they're saying potentially you will need to get the vaccine to travel.
[03:57:45.520 --> 03:57:46.040]  Gonna wrap it up.
[03:57:46.080 --> 03:57:46.981]  Warham is coming up next.
[03:57:47.321 --> 03:57:49.003]  Summit.News as always.
[03:58:00.137 --> 03:58:01.538]  The globalists want you sick.
[03:58:02.318 --> 03:58:03.819]  They want you emasculated.
[03:58:03.899 --> 03:58:05.099]  They want you dehumanized.
[03:58:05.399 --> 03:58:06.500]  They want you dumbed down.
[03:58:07.020 --> 03:58:10.202]  They want you to be a weak, pathetic slave.
[03:58:10.862 --> 03:58:17.825]  And they start that control system by dumbing you down for birth and never letting you know the truth of what is unfolding.
[03:58:18.165 --> 03:58:19.646]  It is simply disgusting.
[03:58:20.306 --> 03:58:23.369]  Ever hear the establishment telling you that vitamin D3 is vital?
[03:58:23.389 --> 03:58:31.976]  You ever hear them explain to you that 40 plus percent of the public is vitamin D3 deficient and so many diseases and chronic problems are caused by it?
[03:58:31.996 --> 03:58:32.036]  No!
[03:58:32.156 --> 03:58:38.181]  Even though it's known scientific fact like gravity or the temperature at which water boils.
[03:58:38.501 --> 03:58:39.102]  These are facts.
[03:58:39.422 --> 03:58:39.943]  Well guess what?
[03:58:39.963 --> 03:58:42.585]  Winter Sun, after being sold out for months, is now back in stock.
[03:58:42.805 --> 03:58:46.549]  I didn't just get into the vitamin D3 game when it became so huge last year.
[03:58:46.629 --> 03:58:49.232]  We've been promoting it for more than 15 years with sponsors.
[03:58:49.372 --> 03:58:51.935]  Then about 8 years ago I started InfoWorks Life.
[03:58:52.055 --> 03:58:59.804]  I approached one of the top firms in the country and I said I want to sell the highest quality liquid vitamin D3 under the tongue because the science shows that's the best way to take it.
