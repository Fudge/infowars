[00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:24.845]  When the legislatures, courts, and Congress fail to do their duty under the 12th Amendment, you must be ready, Mr. President, to immediately declare a limited form of martial law, and that's key, a limited form, because the left already put us under it, and temporarily suspend the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections for the sole purpose of having the military oversee a national re-vote, a vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction and reflects the true will of the people.
[00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:27.687]  And by the way, under even the UN and the U.S.
[00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:28.608]  State Department rules,
[00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:34.729]  If there aren't poll watchers, and there isn't a record that can be inspected, elections are thrown out.
[00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.954]  Well, they kicked all the poll watchers out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:44.870]  A vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction and reflects the true will of the people.
[00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.431]  Federal candidates only.
[00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:53.977]  Paper ballots, no computers, hand-counted, and it's county to local, precinct, and that's how it's done.
[00:00:53.997 --> 00:00:54.458]  It's easier.
[00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:57.220]  Hand-counted with both parties watching every vote.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.166]  Only registered votes, photo ID to provide residence, conducted safely with everyone wearing masks and six feet apart, blah blah blah.
[00:01:04.446 --> 00:01:05.747]  And it goes on from that point.
[00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:09.881]  It's on InfoWars.com, the full letter.
[00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:12.003]  It's strong, but not strong enough.
[00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.565]  It's a CHICOM Globalist-funded attack.
[00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:16.868]  The article is at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:16.968 --> 00:01:26.297]  If you value your freedom, if you value the future, if you want to stop the Civil War, you must go to InfoWars.com.
[00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:30.322]  Jarrett, firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems,
[00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:44.754]  Just bought it in 2018, is 70 plus percent owned by the Communist Chinese government itself, and gave 400 million out of a secret Swiss bank account on October 7th.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.121]  Less than a month before the election.
[00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:49.121]  27 days before the election.
[00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:50.822]  I mean, that is incredible.
[00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:53.803]  The documents are all there at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:54.543]  Share it.
[00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:56.044]  It's from the SEC.
[00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:57.284]  You can go find it.
[00:01:57.844 --> 00:01:59.945]  If this goes out, this is the total proof.
[00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:01.286]  Hiding in plain view.
[00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:06.668]  And we have put it out for you and hired the big investigative team to dig through all this.
[00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:09.669]  And they tried to hide it, but they failed.
[00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:15.789]  They tried to hide the subsidiary names and subgroups, but we tracked it all back, and we have it now.
[00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:21.256]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:25.612]  To me, it's all positive.
[00:02:25.672 --> 00:02:32.377]  I was asked today, on a scale of 1 to 10, who will be the next president, and I said 10, it'll be Donald Trump.
[00:02:32.957 --> 00:02:33.958]  It'll be President Trump.
[00:02:33.978 --> 00:02:35.019]  There's no doubt in my mind.
[00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.222]  There's no doubt in my mind that he won this election, hands down, in a landslide.
[00:02:39.662 --> 00:02:45.527]  Probably somewhere between 350 and 400 electoral college votes.
[00:02:45.887 --> 00:02:48.289]  He was part of those 16 intelligence agencies.
[00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.202]  That is able to see all the intel, the data, and that's why his story is the same thing I tell you.
[00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:57.785]  I can read what the globalists say at the CFR and read what Xi Jinping says.
[00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:08.172]  No force has stopped the Chinese people and the Chinese nation from moving ahead.
[00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:10.213]  The projections are that by 2050,
[00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.722]  That that 70%, or the 60% is now with the G7, that 70% will be 35%.
[00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:15.722]  35%.
[00:03:15.782 --> 00:03:18.564]  China and India together will be 50% of the global GDP.
[00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:18.564]  50%.
[00:03:18.624 --> 00:03:23.428]  We're seeing a move in the next 40 years, the likes of which has not been seen for 200 years.
[00:03:23.448 --> 00:03:23.869]  And it's real.
[00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:24.369]  And it's real.
[00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:41.154]  And we're not preparing for it.
[00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:45.496]  It turns out that China is going to overtake the United States in 2027.
[00:03:47.277 --> 00:03:50.438]  It was said that this might be delayed for a year or two.
[00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.600]  But this year, God has pulled off a little trick, right?
[00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:00.363]  God created COVID-19 and spread it to every country in the world.
[00:04:00.563 --> 00:04:01.563]  We still have 4,000 dead, right?
[00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:10.909]  But if 4,000 Chinese die versus 220,000 in the United States, we haven't really lost a single person, have we?
[00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.532]  In 2012, we achieved absolute superiority over the U.S.
[00:04:15.593 --> 00:04:16.213]  and Japan.
[00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:19.595]  We have gained absolute superiority over the U.S.
[00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:20.376]  military.
[00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:25.319]  And we are expanding our military at a rate unprecedented in human history.
[00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.422]  As long as we go to work every day, we will drive the U.S.
[00:04:29.662 --> 00:04:30.422]  to its death.
[00:04:33.044 --> 00:04:39.229]  They teach the Army and Marine Corps training centers that America must merge with China for world peace.
[00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.252]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:51.019]  Well, if you listen to Klaus Schwab and the Davos Group and Xi Jinping, the Great Reset is modeled after the Great Leap Forward.
[00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.644]  The theme of this year's Summer Davos is Shaping Innovative Societies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:00.888]  What does an innovative society look like on your mind?
[00:05:01.874 --> 00:05:05.218]  We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.444]  Technology will change everything.
[00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:13.449]  Business models, but it will also change society.
[00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.432]  And we have to be prepared for it.
[00:05:15.912 --> 00:05:19.037]  What is necessary is to make sure that the
[00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:32.019]  Population absorbs all those changes and understands that those changes at the end are beneficial for our lives, for the quality of our lives.
[00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:48.782]  From David Rockefeller's own words, he's the guy that opened up China in the 70s, they put Mao in in the late 40s, and they just killed
[00:05:51.348 --> 00:05:57.978]  Most of their people, they were actually informed about what was going on to create the Communist Party you have today.
[00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:28.857]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:30.738]  You better believe you got one!
[00:06:31.038 --> 00:06:34.840]  Alright folks, we're coming back on the other side.
[00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:38.282]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:56.368 --> 00:06:57.149]  It's Monday night.
[00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:06.315]  We've been working on this story for two weeks and now the whistleblower has given us the authorization to go forward with the information you are about to see.
[00:07:06.355 --> 00:07:13.740]  This is the first report and several we're going to be breaking with the documents if MSM challenges this in any way.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:31.897]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a major health executive over a 35 hospital network in western Pennsylvania that is exposing the fact that COVID-19 is a completely overblown power grab scam.
[00:07:32.277 --> 00:07:38.523]  Now we received this information directly from this whistleblower, checked out their credentials,
[00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:43.065]  And that was just the beginning of how insane this got.
[00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:44.767]  Listen to this information.
[00:07:46.088 --> 00:07:49.932]  This individual is involved in the management of 35 Hospital Network in Western Pennsylvania.
[00:07:50.313 --> 00:07:52.955]  The UPMC is the name of the company.
[00:07:54.033 --> 00:08:05.116]  During the latest so-called surge of COVID-19, where they claim the hospitals are all overwhelmed, we've got to have a lockdown again, they went from 96 beds to around 600.
[00:08:05.677 --> 00:08:13.499]  That is only 10% of the capacity they have just for COVID-19, and their hospitals are basically wide open.
[00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:14.979]  And here's the most important point.
[00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:19.041]  No deaths of the 600 people.
[00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:23.162]  Most patients stayed overnight for observation because they tested positive.
[00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:37.389]  Media will say hospitalization patients have surged over 600%, but it's the test that's been turned up 45 times, and German courts have ruled that it is a fake test 96% of the time.
[00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:39.510]  So this is a major industrial scam.
[00:08:40.031 --> 00:08:49.736]  You've seen the big reports about the famous female CEO that had a test that could find cancer in your blood, and it was incredible, and they made hundreds of billions of dollars, and it turned out it was all scam?
[00:08:50.416 --> 00:08:55.699]  That's what this PCR scam is, and the inventor of it came out and said just that.
[00:08:56.159 --> 00:09:09.905]  If they could find this virus in you at all, and with PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody, it starts making you believe in the sort of Buddhist notion that everything is contained in everything else, right?
[00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:16.909]  I mean, because if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really measure, which PCR can do,
[00:09:17.549 --> 00:09:23.753]  Then there's just very few molecules that you don't have at least one single one of them in your body, okay?
[00:09:24.054 --> 00:09:27.536]  So that could be thought of as a misuse of it just to claim that it's meaningful.
[00:09:28.096 --> 00:09:31.939]  So it's not about deaths now, it's all about the cases, the cases, the cases.
[00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.001]  Remember what we first broke eight months ago?
[00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:43.227]  Texas counties, where they were told if one person tests positive, claim 15 people around them have it, and that's also used.
[00:09:43.287 --> 00:09:45.469]  So this is the biggest hoax
[00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:48.669]  Ever perpetrated in history, not just a medical hoax.
[00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:55.095]  And that's why they've got top scientists and virologists and epidemiologists going public saying it's the biggest hoax ever.
[00:09:55.716 --> 00:10:01.461]  Not that there isn't a virus that if you're run down and don't have your vitamin D3 and your vitamin C and your zinc.
[00:10:02.062 --> 00:10:06.486]  Sure, you're an old person in a nursing home, 85 years old, already had cancer, heart attacks.
[00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:10.229]  It can kill you just like the flu or a regular cold or pneumonia.
[00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.193]  But the response to it and the fear-mongering and the power grab is a hoax.
[00:10:15.473 --> 00:10:26.679]  And even Klaus Schwab, the globalist of the Davos Group, says this is a great reset, that the virus really isn't a threat, and that it's the excuse to bring in this planetary rule and total control.
[00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:35.464]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[00:10:36.725 --> 00:10:38.967]  To a major cyber attack.
[00:10:39.908 --> 00:10:58.924]  To use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons the cybersecurity community can draw and improve our preparedness for a potential cyber pandemic.
[00:10:59.304 --> 00:11:07.650]  We are now still fighting the virus, but we can be rather optimistic after what we have seen with the announcement of vaccines.
[00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:13.353]  Now we have to think how to structure, how to design the post-Corona era.
[00:11:13.934 --> 00:11:18.817]  And here, of course, the word reset comes to my mind, because one thing is clear.
[00:11:19.177 --> 00:11:21.819]  We cannot come back to the old normal.
[00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:28.744]  We have to use this opportunity, as our parents and grandparents have done after the World War II.
[00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:34.371]  To really reflect on what went wrong and what could we do better.
[00:11:34.811 --> 00:11:42.362]  Everything we're seeing this fall going into the winter is a repeat of what we saw in January, February and March earlier this year.
[00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:48.253]  They tell you, just 15 days to stay at home, the hospitals will be overwhelmed.
[00:11:48.553 --> 00:11:50.054]  Was it true the hospitals were empty?
[00:11:51.314 --> 00:11:53.455]  Independent journalists went out and documented that.
[00:11:53.475 --> 00:11:56.736]  The media tried to deny it at first, but later had to admit it was true.
[00:11:57.357 --> 00:12:07.501]  And as InfoWars has pointed out in the last few years, Big Tech, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, have been merging and investing in Big Pharma and the hospital systems.
[00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:10.863]  So now they're even banning consumer watchdog groups.
[00:12:11.123 --> 00:12:18.489]  They're banning medical doctors and epidemiologists, virologists, and scientists who come out and point all this out because they want to use this hysteria.
[00:12:28.297 --> 00:12:33.581]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, December 1st, 2020.
[00:12:36.663 --> 00:12:42.405]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I have been preparing for this broadcast since 6 a.m.
[00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:51.247]  this morning and the news is so massive, so over-the-top, so dangerous that I was unable to go on until 12 minutes into the transmission.
[00:12:52.448 --> 00:13:03.731]  That is because we have breaking information coming in that is being added to information we've been working on for weeks and months and years as the conflagration, the planetary alignment politically
[00:13:04.648 --> 00:13:06.208]  Spiritually, economically happens.
[00:13:09.229 --> 00:13:10.689]  Let me tell you what we have here.
[00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.910]  We've talked about things that Project Veritas has broken.
[00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.791]  We've talked about things that Breitbart's broken.
[00:13:17.811 --> 00:13:19.431]  We've talked about things Tucker Carlson has broken.
[00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:23.932]  I love when they do big things to say they've broken the biggest thing ever.
[00:13:25.292 --> 00:13:32.874]  This isn't about credit, but I have to tell you, we are breaking information on this show today that is the biggest thing
[00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:39.106]  Ever broken concerning this fraudulent election and what happened.
[00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:44.471]  Now I've been on the phone with a lot of different White House lawyers.
[00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:49.216]  And I've been on the phone with what's left of the patriots in the Pentagon.
[00:13:50.057 --> 00:13:52.599]  And I have been on the phone with the national talk show host.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.963]  And everybody's trying to decide what to do at this point.
[00:13:57.278 --> 00:13:58.719]  But let me just drop it on you right now.
[00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:01.380]  Infowars.com live show feed headline.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.981]  Must watch Tuesday live.
[00:14:06.482 --> 00:14:08.002]  That's got a typo, but that's okay.
[00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:14.905]  Top lawyers advise Trump to declare martial law, hold new election.
[00:14:15.205 --> 00:14:16.806]  And that headline just went out minutes ago.
[00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:17.766]  My typo.
[00:14:17.786 --> 00:14:18.887]  Typed that myself.
[00:14:19.247 --> 00:14:20.127]  Let's get that fixed, please.
[00:14:21.768 --> 00:14:23.448]  But there is so much going on.
[00:14:23.489 --> 00:14:24.729]  There is so much breaking.
[00:14:25.369 --> 00:14:26.790]  There is so much unfolding.
[00:14:28.277 --> 00:14:28.858]  Right now.
[00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.941]  And you just heard what I told you.
[00:14:32.961 --> 00:14:33.682]  Look at this headline.
[00:14:35.183 --> 00:14:40.387]  Attorney Lynn Wood, President Trump should declare martial law to hold new election.
[00:14:41.608 --> 00:14:42.469]  That sounds radical.
[00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:43.370]  That sounds extreme.
[00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:48.915]  We've been put under corporate globalist martial law.
[00:14:51.937 --> 00:14:53.558]  We're already under martial law.
[00:14:53.578 --> 00:14:56.101]  They've already put us under UN martial law.
[00:14:57.099 --> 00:15:00.080]  It's unconstitutional, it's criminal, but it's like being kidnapped.
[00:15:01.561 --> 00:15:02.861]  There's not a legitimate warrant.
[00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:07.063]  It's illegitimate that you're being taken by force with guns, but it's happening.
[00:15:09.564 --> 00:15:13.285]  So that's just one of the big stories, and I've got the inside baseball on what's behind that.
[00:15:13.805 --> 00:15:23.789]  And the fact that three months ago, Roger Stone said Trump must declare martial law when they try to steal the election and seize the servers and the proof, which is now finally starting to happen.
[00:15:24.844 --> 00:15:26.445]  It's not us that want the martial law.
[00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:33.991]  It's the left and the corporate media and the chi-coms that are ending this country as we know it, and who have announced the lockdown is permanent and will never end.
[00:15:35.432 --> 00:15:39.514]  Now that's the big Lin Wood story, full page ad, Washington Times.
[00:15:39.554 --> 00:15:41.336]  We're going to be reading the whole thing here on air today.
[00:15:42.797 --> 00:15:43.697]  In fact, bottom of the hour.
[00:15:45.218 --> 00:15:46.399]  But then there's this story.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:54.025]  I hired a respected security firm that's done security research for the army and other groups.
[00:15:55.424 --> 00:16:08.789]  To dig in when I was asked by the White House to investigate it three weeks ago into Dominion and it being owned by the Chai Comps.
[00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:10.470]  We got the proof.
[00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.131]  We checked it with the SEC, confirmed it two days ago.
[00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:18.246]  And we now publish the findings at InfoWars.com.
[00:16:18.886 --> 00:16:26.491]  Firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million from a Swiss bank account with connection to Chinese government before election.
[00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:28.652]  You heard me right.
[00:16:28.952 --> 00:16:29.833]  It's even stronger than that.
[00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:30.753]  We are live.
[00:16:30.793 --> 00:16:32.074]  It's Tuesday, December 1st.
[00:16:32.114 --> 00:16:32.434]  The year is 2020.
[00:16:32.754 --> 00:16:36.717]  We are 50 days out from the inauguration.
[00:16:37.137 --> 00:16:39.518]  Will it be the puppet Chi-Com operative Joe Biden?
[00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:43.981]  Or will it be the man who won an even bigger landslide, Donald John Trump?
[00:16:46.075 --> 00:16:48.757]  Now, Roger Stone said this three months ago.
[00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:54.941]  Lin Wood, who's a very respected top lawyer, said it today in a full-page ad in the Washington Times.
[00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:56.682]  We'll be reading in full next segment.
[00:16:58.103 --> 00:17:08.651]  But when you have foreign powers and massive election fraud, the executive branch must declare a civil emergency, Lin Wood calls it martial law, and have a new election.
[00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:13.328]  They put out a fraudulent election with 80 million ballots.
[00:17:13.888 --> 00:17:15.090]  They mailed out 700,000 extra ballots.
[00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.291]  Let me explain that again.
[00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:18.113]  700,000 extra ballots came back in Georgia.
[00:17:25.404 --> 00:17:29.847]  That did not exist, that were falsified, probably by the Communist Chinese.
[00:17:30.628 --> 00:17:31.489]  This is so huge.
[00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:42.877]  But let me give you the big InfoWars exclusive of two big InfoWars exclusives that the system is fighting and battling as hard as it can to make sure it does not get out to anybody.
[00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:54.726]  Firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million from Swiss bank with connection to Chinese government before election.
[00:17:56.653 --> 00:17:57.894]  Now that's putting it lightly.
[00:17:58.475 --> 00:18:01.778]  It's actually two of them are Chinese government-run subsidiaries.
[00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:19.114]  An investigation into Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed that the firm which owns Dominion Voting Systems, which is a voting machine company, received $400 million from a Swiss bank account with close links to the Chinese government less than a month before the election.
[00:18:20.236 --> 00:18:30.773]  The investigation conducted by Austin Security and Investigation Solutions centers on Staple Street Capital and acquired Dominion Voting Systems in 2018.
[00:18:30.813 --> 00:18:34.660]  The Carlisle Group and Soros own that.
[00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:50.174]  Dominion Voting Systems operates voting machines in 28 states and has been accused by President Trump and his supporters of being involved in deleting millions of votes for Trump in addition to switching votes to Biden on election night.
[00:18:51.115 --> 00:19:00.342]  On October 8, 2020, Staple Street Capital filed SEC Form D offerings and sales amounts of $400 million.
[00:19:02.495 --> 00:19:14.202]  With the Sales Compensation Recipient Identification as UBS Securities stakes the investigation, which also notes that another payment of $200 million was received in December of 2014.
[00:19:14.662 --> 00:19:24.288]  UBS Securities is a Swiss investment bank which owns 24.99% of UBS Securities Co Ltd, a Chinese investment bank.
[00:19:24.768 --> 00:19:29.871]  The remaining 75% of UBS Securities Co Ltd is owned by the Chinese government.
[00:19:31.357 --> 00:19:32.437]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:19:33.678 --> 00:19:42.720]  UBS Securities is a Swiss investment bank which owns 24.99% of the UBS Securities Co Ltd, a Chinese investment bank.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:50.022]  The remaining 75% of UBS Securities Co Ltd is owned by the Chinese government, states the report.
[00:19:50.842 --> 00:19:52.842]  Almost all of it is Chinese government.
[00:19:53.062 --> 00:19:59.944]  So the real headline is, Chinese Communist government caught laundering 400 million through Swiss bank to Dominion.
[00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.011]  Month before election.
[00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.012]  Whoa!
[00:20:05.433 --> 00:20:06.674]  And we've got all these documents.
[00:20:06.694 --> 00:20:07.555]  They're linked to the article.
[00:20:09.096 --> 00:20:14.940]  The overall owners of UBS Securities Co Ltd are Beijing, Guangzhang, 33%, UBS 24.99, Guangdong,
[00:20:19.793 --> 00:20:20.413]  We're good.
[00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:46.650]  Group 100% stakeholder in the Guangdong provincial government.
[00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.231]  The Guangdong provincial government.
[00:20:49.752 --> 00:20:54.035]  Poor Chinese peasant's money was used to steal our election.
[00:20:54.455 --> 00:20:59.118]  China Guangding is a state-owned enterprise administered by the SASAC.
[00:21:01.172 --> 00:21:01.312]  Wow!
[00:21:01.372 --> 00:21:02.053]  That's Xi Jinping!
[00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:44.385]  The revelation that Dominion Voting Systems has financial ties to the Chinese government via UBS Securities will boost claims and bolster claims by Trump supporters that foreign actors working on behalf of Communist China may have sought to meddle in the presidential election.
[00:21:44.645 --> 00:21:45.206]  No, no, no.
[00:21:45.566 --> 00:21:48.669]  This is smoking freaking gun, man.
[00:21:49.189 --> 00:21:49.970]  If they caught
[00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:56.756]  Russian companies pumping hundreds of millions into a voting machine company that then did mysterious stuff for Trump?
[00:21:57.016 --> 00:21:58.618]  I would call for his damn arrest!
[00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.600]  But there was no evidence of that!
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.142]  But here it's absolutely confirmed!
[00:22:05.745 --> 00:22:09.868]  I was put on the lead of this by a very high-level individual in the White House.
[00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:12.060]  And I said, why me?
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.741]  And they said, look, we already know it's there.
[00:22:13.761 --> 00:22:15.202]  This has to be independent.
[00:22:15.623 --> 00:22:16.463]  You need to go find it.
[00:22:16.803 --> 00:22:19.606]  So I hired a security firm, and I told them, dig.
[00:22:20.046 --> 00:22:20.866]  And then this came in.
[00:22:21.927 --> 00:22:22.928]  And it's all confirmed.
[00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:25.930]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.311]  Guys, show the article, please, for TV viewers.
[00:22:27.812 --> 00:22:28.492]  Put the article up.
[00:22:28.512 --> 00:22:29.433]  Please scroll through it for everybody.
[00:22:31.297 --> 00:22:37.362]  Firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems received 400 million from Swiss Bank with connection to Chinese government.
[00:22:37.402 --> 00:22:37.843]  No, no, no.
[00:22:37.903 --> 00:22:42.247]  Swiss Bank partnership owned by the Chinese government.
[00:22:43.007 --> 00:22:44.949]  Smoking fricking gun!
[00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.711]  Smoking gun!
[00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:47.952]  Smoking gun!
[00:22:50.254 --> 00:22:51.095]  And I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:22:52.356 --> 00:22:52.536]  But...
[00:22:55.026 --> 00:22:58.788]  This is the biggest thing we've ever broken when it turns to this country and the Republic.
[00:22:59.349 --> 00:23:03.711]  I don't know what I had to do to get you to share it, to email it, to get it out.
[00:23:03.831 --> 00:23:06.733]  It's the smoking gun of the Communist Chinese.
[00:23:06.993 --> 00:23:07.714]  Did you hear?
[00:23:08.214 --> 00:23:19.441]  Almost the majority of the entire investment bank, Swiss Investment Bank Fund, is owned by provincial governments and the central committee of the Communist Party in Communist China?
[00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:21.002]  Holy hell!
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.221]  This is ridiculous!
[00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:25.782]  Where is the Senate?
[00:23:27.183 --> 00:23:28.224]  Where are the Republicans?
[00:23:28.985 --> 00:23:30.406]  They're on the payroll, the same thing.
[00:23:30.726 --> 00:23:31.506]  Just like Big Tech.
[00:23:31.927 --> 00:23:33.108]  We were sold out to China.
[00:23:33.368 --> 00:23:34.448]  We were merged to China.
[00:23:34.469 --> 00:23:39.812]  And it's like that Howard Beale thing in Network, where he says, listen, you didn't just mess up a business deal.
[00:23:40.052 --> 00:23:41.554]  The Arabs have taken billions out.
[00:23:41.894 --> 00:23:43.355]  Now the Arabs must put it back in.
[00:23:43.695 --> 00:23:46.757]  Oh, you mean to own our voting systems and say we don't have our right to vote?
[00:23:47.638 --> 00:23:50.300]  This is the smoking gun.
[00:23:51.954 --> 00:23:53.514]  Smoking gun breaking!
[00:23:54.155 --> 00:24:01.177]  Swiss bank fund owned by Chinese government gave Dominion $400 million on eve of election.
[00:24:02.057 --> 00:24:03.578]  I mean, wow!
[00:24:04.098 --> 00:24:08.639]  What do I need to do to get people to realize how huge this is?
[00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:13.841]  All the censorship, all the lockdowns, all the control was to stop this information getting out.
[00:24:15.265 --> 00:24:20.768]  And then you've got the Communist Chinese on record printing up millions of fake ballots and driver's licenses.
[00:24:20.788 --> 00:24:22.349]  And it came out that the U.S.
[00:24:22.469 --> 00:24:27.413]  raided the Chinese consulate in Houston and said they were creating counterfeit ballots.
[00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:30.374]  And they were burning it all in a huge fire.
[00:24:30.574 --> 00:24:31.975]  And that even came out and was confirmed.
[00:24:32.436 --> 00:24:38.840]  And then now in Georgia, hundreds of thousands of ballots all perfectly imprinted by computers in the Scantron bubbles.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.921]  I mean, it's all there.
[00:24:41.081 --> 00:24:41.722]  They did it.
[00:24:42.322 --> 00:24:42.863]  They did it.
[00:24:42.943 --> 00:24:46.345]  Chinese planes, private charter jets, landing all over the U.S.
[00:24:46.606 --> 00:24:54.151]  the night before the election, with ballots, and the Chinese men going in after the polling places were closed, with the big boxes of ballots.
[00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:55.813]  They even sent in their own people!
[00:24:57.754 --> 00:25:06.501]  If you visit the tip of the spear, InfoWars.com, the site the enemy has been attacking and trying to shut down like none other, you will see the top story.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:22.043]  Voting machine firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems received 400 million from Swiss bank fund, 75 plus percent owned officially by the Communist Chinese government a month before the election.
[00:25:23.903 --> 00:25:31.705]  Now, we are publishing, there's quite a bit of these documents for the Securities and Exchange Commission on the site as we speak, more is being added.
[00:25:33.939 --> 00:25:39.003]  Because the individual here at my office put this report together, wanted to be careful about how much he put out, but I told him to just post everything.
[00:25:40.584 --> 00:25:42.045]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:25:42.065 --> 00:25:44.166]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:25:44.767 --> 00:25:49.290]  So, we have that incredible story for you.
[00:25:52.307 --> 00:25:53.448]  That is smoking gun.
[00:25:54.128 --> 00:25:55.109]  It's not nebulous.
[00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:56.590]  No, it's the proof.
[00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:14.324]  And what do you do when a foreign government owns your debt, owns most of Hollywood, on record, four of the six big studios, is financing race war, and have national state-run TV programs where they say, America will never be unlocked down.
[00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:15.405]  We are not locked down.
[00:26:15.445 --> 00:26:18.167]  We're using COVID to, quote, destroy and kill America.
[00:26:18.467 --> 00:26:19.788]  America will be gone soon.
[00:26:20.609 --> 00:26:21.750]  We are killing America.
[00:26:23.012 --> 00:26:25.395]  If these are quotes, I played them at the very start of the show.
[00:26:26.437 --> 00:26:28.900]  In the report, America on Collision Course with Communism.
[00:26:30.382 --> 00:26:32.125]  Allied with all these big banks and corporations.
[00:26:33.827 --> 00:26:35.489]  Because they're all authoritarians.
[00:26:38.053 --> 00:26:39.475]  And they have an alliance of evil.
[00:26:41.403 --> 00:27:00.522]  And so, when you have the blue states, the blue cities, the corporations, big tech, censoring everybody's speech about criticizing the lockdown, censoring thousands of doctors and scientists and nurses that say COVID's an overblown hoax, when you have people being arrested and beat up by the police because they're not wearing a mask in public, walking down the street, you're under martial law.
[00:27:01.082 --> 00:27:04.766]  Corporate, globalist, martial law has already been declared.
[00:27:06.775 --> 00:27:24.185]  And Bill Gates says, I want to depopulate you, and I'm coming with a forced inoculation, and you won't get a job or get on an airplane or go to a grocery store unless you have a QR code showing that you've been vaccinated with five vaccines I want you to take a year, which he admits can hurt you, violating the Nuremberg Code and the Geneva Convention.
[00:27:24.305 --> 00:27:29.728]  I mean, this is Nazi stuff on its face, dyed in the wool, to the fine print, bonafide.
[00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.631]  And so what is the response to that?
[00:27:35.725 --> 00:27:48.815]  Well, you got a bunch of not-need lawyers and leftists and all the big Democrat lawyers meeting with the key leadership in Georgia and Pennsylvania and Nevada and Arizona and obviously paying them off to go along with this and saying, you'll be supported.
[00:27:49.115 --> 00:27:51.056]  We'll use the machines to keep you in power.
[00:27:51.797 --> 00:27:53.838]  Now that you're part of the club, you'll end up being a U.S.
[00:27:53.878 --> 00:27:54.199]  Senator.
[00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:55.540]  You'll end up being a president.
[00:27:57.761 --> 00:27:59.703]  Just betray America and play ball.
[00:27:59.763 --> 00:28:01.084]  Well, that leads us to this next article.
[00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:03.494]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:28:03.614 --> 00:28:12.799]  We've posted the full page article, ad, that the very respected lawyer, Lee Lynn Greenwood, has put out.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.502]  And I'm gonna go ahead and again read you this headline right here.
[00:28:16.602 --> 00:28:24.666]  Attorney Lynn Wood, President Trump should declare martial law and hold new election.
[00:28:26.487 --> 00:28:30.530]  Then he goes through, in this full page article, full page ad,
[00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:34.399]  You can still pay to get your speech out, I guess, in America.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.502]  And I totally agree with this constitutional analysis.
[00:28:43.305 --> 00:28:50.930]  And I'm asking you to go to InfoWars.com and to get this op-ed, to get this report, and get it out to everyone you know now.
[00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.251]  It's also posted at TheGatewayPundit.com.
[00:28:53.892 --> 00:28:54.612]  We the people.
[00:28:57.254 --> 00:28:57.774]  Convention.
[00:28:58.815 --> 00:28:59.776]  We're right back to July 4th, 1776.
[00:29:03.914 --> 00:29:10.694]  Exercising extraordinary authority in defense of our vote may be required because martial law is better than civil war.
[00:29:12.369 --> 00:29:16.391]  In the months following the start of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln struggled to preserve the Union.
[00:29:16.972 --> 00:29:20.274]  Many objected to Lincoln's extraordinary use of presidential authority.
[00:29:20.674 --> 00:29:23.095]  In particular, his suspension of the right of habeas corpus.
[00:29:23.796 --> 00:29:28.919]  On June 12, 1863, Lincoln defended his extreme measures in a letter published in the New York Times.
[00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:35.243]  Citing Article 1 of the Constitution, he argued, Ours is a case of rebellion.
[00:29:35.743 --> 00:29:38.905]  In fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion.
[00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:51.136]  And the provision of the Constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in case of rebellion, this is the key, or invasion.
[00:29:51.176 --> 00:29:52.498]  This is a globalist takeover.
[00:29:52.638 --> 00:29:54.700]  The public safety may require it.
[00:29:55.706 --> 00:30:04.511]  In the provision which specifically applies to our present case, Lincoln used the same reasoning to justify a series of extraordinary presidential orders.
[00:30:05.031 --> 00:30:06.432]  But why even use what Lincoln did?
[00:30:06.512 --> 00:30:07.312]  That was questionable.
[00:30:07.893 --> 00:30:10.574]  This is a foreign Chi-Com takeover, honey.
[00:30:12.815 --> 00:30:18.658]  Lincoln ordered hundreds of northern newspapers that spoke against him to be shut down and their owners and editors arrested.
[00:30:19.459 --> 00:30:21.540]  But they're Chi-Com agents, the globalists are.
[00:30:22.907 --> 00:30:29.877]  Lincoln ordered the arrest of Ohio Congressman Clement Vandeldeham for the crime of speaking out against him.
[00:30:30.278 --> 00:30:32.761]  Chief Justice of the U.S.
[00:30:32.881 --> 00:30:35.805]  Roger Taney ruled that Lincoln had violated the U.S.
[00:30:35.845 --> 00:30:37.107]  Constitution when he illegally
[00:30:37.887 --> 00:30:39.348]  Suspended the writ of habeas corpus.
[00:30:39.828 --> 00:30:43.809]  After hearing this, Lincoln signed an arrest warrant to have Chief Justice of the U.S.
[00:30:43.849 --> 00:30:44.229]  arrested.
[00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:51.973]  Lincoln ordered the arrest of thousands in Maryland for the crime of suspected Southern sympathies, including ordering the arrest of U.S.
[00:30:52.233 --> 00:30:55.234]  Congressman Henry May for Maryland.
[00:30:55.874 --> 00:30:58.575]  These people were arrested and held in military prisons without trial.
[00:30:59.176 --> 00:31:00.176]  Some of them for years.
[00:31:00.857 --> 00:31:03.118]  And again, I'm not even endorsing the Lincoln course.
[00:31:03.418 --> 00:31:08.020]  This is a foreign, outside, technocracy, cyber attack takeover.
[00:31:09.081 --> 00:31:19.086]  By the way, they now have a Dominion engineer in the key county in Georgia, walking up illegally, plugging a thumb drive in, walking out with it for a few hours, coming back and plugging it back in.
[00:31:19.346 --> 00:31:19.926]  Totally illegal.
[00:31:19.946 --> 00:31:20.826]  That's how you change votes.
[00:31:21.167 --> 00:31:22.267]  I mean, we have them, folks.
[00:31:22.307 --> 00:31:22.807]  We have them.
[00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:23.748]  We have them.
[00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:32.151]  While some debate these measures still today, no one disagrees that Lincoln and his use of presidential power were responsible for saving the republic.
[00:31:32.998 --> 00:31:37.882]  Well, history and even former President Obama has judged Lincoln as perhaps the greatest president.
[00:31:38.322 --> 00:31:41.865]  Few would have argued at the time he took those actions.
[00:31:42.446 --> 00:31:47.130]  Then, as now, a president with courage and determination was needed to preserve the Union.
[00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:57.699]  Today, the current threat to our United States by the international, domestic, socialist, communist left is much more serious than anything Lincoln or our nation has faced in history, including our civil war.
[00:31:57.759 --> 00:31:58.980]  And I agree, including the British.
[00:32:00.014 --> 00:32:01.995]  Both in 1812 and 1776.
[00:32:03.156 --> 00:32:14.822]  We have well-funded, armed, and trained Marxists and Antifa and BLM strategically positioned in our major cities, acting openly with violence to silence opposition to their anti-American agenda.
[00:32:14.962 --> 00:32:16.623]  Attacking federal buildings and police.
[00:32:16.963 --> 00:32:18.924]  Cowardly punching innocent people in the back of the head.
[00:32:18.984 --> 00:32:22.366]  Assaulting people just for sighting and just for eating in restaurants.
[00:32:23.277 --> 00:32:23.417]  That's
[00:32:43.342 --> 00:32:58.218]  Protects millions of average and particularly minority Americans, which is their own leftist form of martial law, because they suspend the normal law to stop crime, stop arson, stop attack, to get the malice youth brigades going like dominoes to take over the whole country through intimidation.
[00:32:58.378 --> 00:32:59.680]  This is a classic commie takeover.
[00:33:00.865 --> 00:33:11.435]  The results being massive increases in violent crime and death in our cities, and the destruction of small businesses orchestrated by those politicians and leftist groups, many funded by domestic and international communists.
[00:33:11.755 --> 00:33:14.017]  We are literally under attack from within.
[00:33:14.037 --> 00:33:16.700]  And I would add, orchestrated from without.
[00:33:19.502 --> 00:33:24.127]  Then there are admitted Democrat, Socialist, Federal officials plotting to finish gutting the U.S.
[00:33:24.167 --> 00:33:26.569]  Constitution after 100 years of trying.
[00:33:27.699 --> 00:33:30.381]  They promised to take away critical individual rights like free speech.
[00:33:30.661 --> 00:33:31.822]  See, that's martial law already.
[00:33:32.403 --> 00:33:33.644]  Religious freedom, the Second Amendment.
[00:33:33.864 --> 00:33:37.847]  Destroy states' rights by eliminating those electoral college and more.
[00:33:38.207 --> 00:33:49.356]  Pack the Supreme Court with activists, anti-constitutional judges who will make law from the bench and give the right to vote to tens of millions of non-Americans and open our borders to more illegals which will reduce wages.
[00:33:50.136 --> 00:33:51.638]  No one voted for these things.
[00:33:53.117 --> 00:33:57.639]  That were hidden from the majority of Americans, but the corrupt media covered it up.
[00:33:58.059 --> 00:34:00.421]  Not only do we have corrupt media, and it goes on.
[00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:03.722]  And this is just the tip of the iceberg, what this prestigious lawyer wrote.
[00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:06.143]  This is CHICOM globalist war.
[00:34:06.504 --> 00:34:10.065]  All the big banks, all the big tech have doubled their profits or more.
[00:34:10.346 --> 00:34:11.546]  They're raping everything.
[00:34:11.746 --> 00:34:12.787]  We're going bankrupt.
[00:34:12.807 --> 00:34:14.067]  They're telling us we're not essential.
[00:34:14.368 --> 00:34:15.828]  This is 21st century war.
[00:34:16.249 --> 00:34:20.851]  Recognizes an outside globalist attack and arrests the collaborators now.
[00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:24.988]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:34:25.008 --> 00:34:26.289]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:30.210]  We are in the middle of a globalist takeover by Communist Chinese and their allies.
[00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:32.791]  We have caught them red-handed.
[00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:39.033]  Dominion Software given $400 million in October of this year through a secret Swiss bank account.
[00:34:39.354 --> 00:34:40.354]  We have them now.
[00:34:41.134 --> 00:34:42.935]  The article is at Infowars.com.
[00:34:42.955 --> 00:34:48.177]  If you want to fight this takeover, you should need to share it to your email.
[00:34:49.662 --> 00:34:50.302]  Over the phone.
[00:34:50.322 --> 00:34:51.623]  Need to print copies off.
[00:34:51.643 --> 00:34:52.423]  Need to get out to everyone.
[00:34:52.463 --> 00:34:54.844]  The documents are all being posted there so you can see it for yourself.
[00:34:56.264 --> 00:34:57.664]  Constitutional lawyer, very respected.
[00:35:00.045 --> 00:35:01.565]  Lynn Wood has come out with a full-page ad.
[00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.346]  I'm going to continue reading through an op-ed in the Washington Times.
[00:35:06.207 --> 00:35:10.148]  Calling for Trump to respond to this foreign international takeover with martial law.
[00:35:11.308 --> 00:35:13.369]  They've already put us under leftist martial law in their cities.
[00:35:14.687 --> 00:35:16.829]  Closing grocery stores now saying you don't have speech.
[00:35:17.809 --> 00:35:19.170]  Censoring you if you speak out.
[00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:23.133]  And in England and in Australia they arrest you if you criticize the lockdowns.
[00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:26.096]  They're arresting doctors in Germany that say it's a fraud.
[00:35:26.636 --> 00:35:28.217]  This is the UN global takeover.
[00:35:28.878 --> 00:35:33.481]  So the response is martial law to stop their martial law and arrest them.
[00:35:34.982 --> 00:35:36.864]  But the FBI has been sold out.
[00:35:38.365 --> 00:35:40.887]  Even though they're gonna all be destroyed and have no pension funds either.
[00:35:41.247 --> 00:35:42.388]  They just are too cowardly.
[00:35:43.028 --> 00:35:43.569]  They're yes men.
[00:35:46.132 --> 00:35:47.593]  Not all of them, but the top.
[00:35:47.753 --> 00:35:49.954]  This is what we've been made a party to.
[00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:51.715]  But America's seeing it in awakening.
[00:35:52.995 --> 00:35:57.578]  It's easy to try to occupy a country, but we'll see how easy it is as the global awakening happens.
[00:35:58.998 --> 00:36:03.641]  I was in two stores this morning, and both people said they were aware of the Great Reset and the New World Order.
[00:36:03.681 --> 00:36:04.721]  They were both young women.
[00:36:07.303 --> 00:36:08.023]  The people are awake.
[00:36:08.443 --> 00:36:09.884]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[00:36:10.124 --> 00:36:11.485]  And they're getting more awake by the minute.
[00:36:12.225 --> 00:36:13.866]  And they're every race, color, and creed coming together.
[00:36:14.838 --> 00:36:16.318]  We'll talk about tomorrow's news today.
[00:36:17.199 --> 00:36:20.299]  Here's The London Guardian, The New York Times, Business Insider.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.200]  Roger was on back in September.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.101]  Roger Stone to Donald Trump.
[00:36:26.141 --> 00:36:27.941]  Bring in martial law if you lose election.
[00:36:28.281 --> 00:36:31.262]  Roger Stone calls for Trump to declare martial law if he loses election.
[00:36:31.582 --> 00:36:33.642]  Order arrest of Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and the Clintons.
[00:36:34.322 --> 00:36:36.823]  Roger Stone calls on Trump to seize total power and
[00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.910]  Assert martial law.
[00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.113]  What he said was he has total power in the Constitution.
[00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:46.699]  If they have Dominion software and fraudulent stuff, then he has to move and seize those.
[00:36:48.621 --> 00:36:52.386]  If the FBI and the courts won't act, he has to declare the civil emergency.
[00:36:52.626 --> 00:36:53.447]  He's the executive.
[00:36:53.627 --> 00:36:54.548]  Protect the Republic.
[00:36:54.749 --> 00:36:55.570]  This is when you do it.
[00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:59.769]  I'm an expert on martial law, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:00.249 --> 00:37:01.649]  I'm against it because the U.N.
[00:37:01.689 --> 00:37:04.950]  wanted to have it through Obama or the Clintons to take our guns.
[00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:08.370]  This is them doing it to move the President out to do it.
[00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:09.791]  This is their U.N.
[00:37:09.911 --> 00:37:20.293]  globalist medical martial law, as the Archbishop and others have called it, it's what it is, to circumvent the government and hope the government just stands back and watches it all happen.
[00:37:22.093 --> 00:37:24.454]  Globalism is corporate media governance.
[00:37:25.174 --> 00:37:26.134]  It's technocracy.
[00:37:27.773 --> 00:37:35.637]  The old dinosaur media, working with the corporate media, working with big tech, with the big banks, the multinationals.
[00:37:37.778 --> 00:37:38.619]  So let's continue.
[00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:39.859]  I'm not going to read his whole letter.
[00:37:39.899 --> 00:37:41.360]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:42.821 --> 00:37:45.122]  The well-trained communists funded by the Chinese.
[00:37:46.042 --> 00:37:51.685]  They're admitted Democrats, socialists, federal officials plotting to finish gutting the Constitution, taking all our speech, our guns.
[00:37:52.466 --> 00:37:54.847]  Everything, as we know it, will be ending.
[00:37:56.291 --> 00:38:02.753]  The socialist left has been openly working to destroy the United States since Obama promised to and tried to transform America in 2008.
[00:38:03.533 --> 00:38:11.035]  And having been stopped by the will of the American people, they openly staged a four-year-long coup to remove the duly elected president.
[00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:12.255]  And you know all about that.
[00:38:14.376 --> 00:38:25.359]  So he goes on to say, President Trump, you and every other official in our local, state, and federal government, and everyone in law enforcement and our military have sworn an oath that says
[00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:32.145]  I will support and I will defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:38:32.826 --> 00:38:36.028]  It is time for everyone who swore that oath to act upon it.
[00:38:36.628 --> 00:38:38.009]  The enemies are within the gates.
[00:38:38.029 --> 00:38:42.111]  I'm going to read that again.
[00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:46.094]  It is time for everyone who swore that oath to act upon it.
[00:38:47.755 --> 00:38:50.096]  And even if you didn't, it's your own self-preservation.
[00:38:50.757 --> 00:38:55.820]  The enemies are within the gates and our Constitution and nation are in real risk of being lost
[00:38:57.025 --> 00:39:00.087]  To this socialist communist invasion, unless you act decisively.
[00:39:28.336 --> 00:39:44.051]  We the people must not and will not cede our exclusive constitutional right to elect representatives to judges, lawyers, courts, governors, secretaries of state, Congress, and corrupt election officials, and local politicians, the corrupt media, or leftist threats of violence.
[00:39:45.112 --> 00:39:50.334]  It is our exclusive right to decide our representatives, not theirs.
[00:39:51.015 --> 00:39:55.317]  Therefore, we the people must demand a new and fair national vote.
[00:39:56.037 --> 00:40:00.059]  A vote that all Americans can trust and live by, regardless of the winner.
[00:40:00.819 --> 00:40:06.782]  Without a fair vote, we fear, with good reason, the threat of a shooting civil war is imminent.
[00:40:07.748 --> 00:40:14.674]  Gun sales are at an all-time high, and 40% for the first-time gun owners looking to defend themselves, their property, and their rights.
[00:40:14.714 --> 00:40:21.060]  Therefore, Mr. President, we must act now before there is no peaceful way left to preserve our nation.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:21.840]  Exactly.
[00:40:21.921 --> 00:40:23.782]  Why did the CHICOMs and the UN do this?
[00:40:24.223 --> 00:40:27.245]  Because even if Trump removes the fraud, there'll be a civil war.
[00:40:28.767 --> 00:40:31.009]  If he goes through the fraudulent system.
[00:40:31.449 --> 00:40:33.411]  It has to be, it's CHICOM attack.
[00:40:34.622 --> 00:40:36.223]  He has to arrest the heads of the media.
[00:40:36.464 --> 00:40:37.445]  He has to arrest them.
[00:40:37.465 --> 00:40:38.405]  They're all Chinese agents.
[00:40:38.626 --> 00:40:39.386]  We have all the proof.
[00:40:40.187 --> 00:40:42.909]  And we have to just go after them and have Nuremberg trials.
[00:40:42.969 --> 00:40:44.871]  I mean, this is an attempted takeover.
[00:40:44.931 --> 00:40:46.052]  This happened during Roosevelt.
[00:40:46.492 --> 00:40:52.678]  The Nazis tried to get a 500,000-man team up to overthrow the government, and then Smedley Butler went and exposed it, and they got stopped.
[00:40:56.766 --> 00:41:04.533]  When the legislatures, courts, and Congress fail to do their duty under the 12th Amendment, you must be ready, Mr. President, to immediately declare a limited form of martial law.
[00:41:04.573 --> 00:41:04.993]  That's key.
[00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:06.174]  A limited form.
[00:41:06.194 --> 00:41:07.775]  Because the left already put us under it.
[00:41:08.176 --> 00:41:21.227]  And temporarily suspend the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections for the sole purpose of having the military oversee a national re-vote, a vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction and reflects the true will of the people.
[00:41:21.427 --> 00:41:23.508]  And by the way, under even the U.N.
[00:41:23.528 --> 00:41:24.089]  and the U.S.
[00:41:24.389 --> 00:41:24.990]  State Department rules,
[00:41:26.263 --> 00:41:31.130]  If there aren't poll watchers, and there isn't a record that can be inspected, elections are thrown out.
[00:41:32.091 --> 00:41:34.354]  Well, they kicked all the poll watchers out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:36.969 --> 00:41:41.252]  A vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction and reflects the true will of the people.
[00:41:41.633 --> 00:41:42.814]  Federal candidates only.
[00:41:43.514 --> 00:41:50.840]  Paper ballots, no computers, hand counted, and it's tallied to local, precinct, and that's how it's done, it's easier.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.602]  Hand counted with both parties watching every vote.
[00:41:54.083 --> 00:42:00.548]  Only registered votes, photo ID to provide residence, conducted safely with everyone wearing masks and six feet apart, blah blah blah.
[00:42:00.848 --> 00:42:02.129]  And it goes on from that point.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.261]  It's on Infowars.com, the full letter.
[00:42:07.042 --> 00:42:08.382]  It's strong, but not strong enough.
[00:42:08.742 --> 00:42:10.943]  It's a CHICOM Globalist-funded attack.
[00:42:11.324 --> 00:42:13.244]  The article is at Infowars.com.
[00:42:13.344 --> 00:42:22.669]  If you value your freedom, if you value the future, if you want to stop the Civil War, you must go to Infowars.com.

[00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:25.830]  Share it.
[00:42:26.531 --> 00:42:28.912]  Firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems.
[00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:43.354]  Just bought it in 2018, is 70 plus percent owned by the Communist Chinese government itself, and gave 400 million out of a secret Swiss bank account on October 7th.
[00:42:44.963 --> 00:42:46.704]  Less than a month before the election.
[00:42:46.724 --> 00:42:47.705]  27 days before the election.
[00:42:48.085 --> 00:42:49.406]  I mean, that is incredible.
[00:42:49.446 --> 00:42:52.368]  The documents are all there at InfoWars.com.
[00:42:52.748 --> 00:42:53.129]  Share it.

[00:42:56.431 --> 00:42:58.533]  If this goes out, this is the total proof.
[00:42:58.853 --> 00:42:59.874]  Hiding in plain view.
[00:43:00.234 --> 00:43:05.277]  And we have put it out for you and hired the big investigative team to dig through all this.
[00:43:05.818 --> 00:43:08.259]  And they tried to hide it, but they failed.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.344]  They tried to hide it through subsidiary names and subgroups, but we tracked it all back and we have it now.
[00:43:15.498 --> 00:43:17.479]  Separately, going to break in just a few seconds.

[00:44:57.246 --> 00:45:00.707]  All right.
[00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:06.228]  I rarely play a clip twice in a show, but I'm going to play right now ahead of Dr. Steve Bucinich joining us.
[00:45:08.649 --> 00:45:11.730]  A report that's at Bandot Video in the John Bounds section.
[00:45:14.403 --> 00:45:16.784]  And that is America's collision course with communism.
[00:45:17.104 --> 00:45:27.349]  Now, I haven't even gotten to all the latest evidence, or Trump's latest lawsuit, or all these SEC documents we've got, and just the insanity of all of this.
[00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:34.173]  Listen, I wish that Joe Biden really would have won for real, because then I wouldn't have to fight so hard.
[00:45:34.493 --> 00:45:36.414]  I mean, I wouldn't be happy he won, but I could deal with that.
[00:45:36.914 --> 00:45:38.495]  I wish he wasn't a communist Chinese agent.
[00:45:38.655 --> 00:45:39.055]  He is.
[00:45:40.316 --> 00:45:42.397]  And we all think of America as invincible.
[00:45:43.857 --> 00:45:49.523]  They have drag queen story time with convicted pedophiles being promoted by the media with your children, and many times not announced.
[00:45:49.543 --> 00:45:52.005]  I mean, we keep babies alive and sell their organs.
[00:45:52.505 --> 00:45:54.007]  America's basically gone.
[00:45:54.087 --> 00:45:55.749]  We have to realize that to get it back.
[00:45:56.369 --> 00:45:56.990]  We have to repent.
[00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.793]  So let's go ahead and go to this report that shows the Globalist admitting it all.
[00:46:02.813 --> 00:46:10.158]  And I'm going to come back and recap the top news and then show you footage of Dominion worker reportedly caught manipulating voter data.
[00:46:10.178 --> 00:46:11.619]  What they did was illegal on tape.
[00:46:11.899 --> 00:46:12.880]  We actually know who he is.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.882]  We're not going to release his name yet, but we've got the intel and so do our people.
[00:46:17.623 --> 00:46:18.524]  But this is incredible.
[00:46:18.944 --> 00:46:20.245]  This will not stand, Globalist.
[00:46:20.265 --> 00:46:20.865]  You've been caught.
[00:46:21.165 --> 00:46:24.608]  We do not accept your fraudulent leader, your CHICOM agent, Joe Biden.
[00:46:24.628 --> 00:46:25.228]  You're on notice.
[00:46:25.469 --> 00:46:25.989]  Here's the report.
[00:46:26.584 --> 00:46:27.685]  To me, it's all positive.
[00:46:27.745 --> 00:46:34.448]  I was asked today, on a scale of 1 to 10, who will be the next president, and I said 10, it'll be Donald Trump.
[00:46:35.008 --> 00:46:36.009]  It'll be President Trump.
[00:46:36.029 --> 00:46:37.089]  There's no doubt in my mind.
[00:46:37.189 --> 00:46:41.271]  There's no doubt in my mind that he won this election, hands down, in a landslide.
[00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:47.574]  Probably somewhere between 350 and 400 electoral college votes.
[00:46:47.975 --> 00:46:50.336]  He was part of those 16 intelligence agencies.
[00:46:51.707 --> 00:46:56.268]  That is able to see all the intel, the data, and that's why his story is the same thing I tell you.
[00:46:56.729 --> 00:46:59.870]  I can read what the globalists say at the CFR and read what Xi Jinping says.
[00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:10.213]  No force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation from forging ahead.
[00:47:10.653 --> 00:47:12.274]  The projections are that by 2050
[00:47:14.147 --> 00:47:17.790]  That that 70%, or the 60% is now with the G7, that 70% will be 35%.
[00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:17.790]  35%.
[00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.632]  China and India together will be 50% of the global GDP.
[00:47:20.652 --> 00:47:20.632]  50%.
[00:47:20.672 --> 00:47:25.596]  We're seeing a move in the next 40 years, the likes of which has not been seen for 200 years.
[00:47:25.616 --> 00:47:25.976]  And it's real.
[00:47:25.996 --> 00:47:26.437]  And it's real.
[00:47:41.221 --> 00:47:43.222]  And we're not preparing for it.
[00:47:43.242 --> 00:47:47.583]  It turns out that China is going to overtake the United States in 2027.
[00:47:49.364 --> 00:47:52.525]  It was said that this might be delayed for a year or two.
[00:47:53.445 --> 00:47:56.686]  But this year, God has pulled off a little trick, right?
[00:47:58.267 --> 00:48:02.468]  God created COVID-19 and spread it to every country in the world.
[00:48:02.628 --> 00:48:03.629]  We still have 4,000 dead, right?
[00:48:05.149 --> 00:48:12.974]  But if 4,000 Chinese die versus 220,000 in the United States, we haven't really lost a single person, have we?
[00:48:13.435 --> 00:48:17.597]  In 2012, we achieved absolute superiority over the U.S.
[00:48:17.658 --> 00:48:18.278]  and Japan.
[00:48:18.478 --> 00:48:21.660]  We have gained absolute superiority over the U.S.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.421]  military.
[00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:27.364]  And we are expanding our military at a rate unprecedented in human history.
[00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:31.487]  As long as we go to work every day, we will drive the U.S.
[00:48:31.727 --> 00:48:32.467]  to its death.
[00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:41.294]  They teach the Army and Marine Corps training centers that America must merge with China for world peace.
[00:48:41.875 --> 00:48:44.297]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[00:48:44.317 --> 00:48:52.984]  Well, if you listen to Klaus Schwab and the Davos Group and Xi Jinping, the Great Reset is modeled after the Great Leap Forward.
[00:48:53.024 --> 00:48:58.709]  The theme of this year's Summer Davos is Shaping Innovative Societies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.933]  What does an innovative society look like on your mind?
[00:49:03.959 --> 00:49:07.283]  We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution.
[00:49:08.285 --> 00:49:11.529]  Technology will change everything.
[00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:15.514]  Business models, but it will also change society.
[00:49:16.055 --> 00:49:17.517]  And we have to be prepared for it.
[00:49:17.957 --> 00:49:22.223]  What is necessary is to make sure that the population
[00:49:22.823 --> 00:49:37.366]  From David Rockefeller's own words.
[00:49:38.126 --> 00:49:39.426]  He's the guy that opened up China.
[00:49:40.947 --> 00:49:46.308]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are living in the most incredible time in world history on so many fronts.
[00:49:47.268 --> 00:49:52.249]  But I got a call from the President's representative
[00:49:53.817 --> 00:49:57.379]  And they asked me three weeks ago when I was in Arizona.
[00:49:57.399 --> 00:50:07.205]  Let's just say one of Trump's sons gave me a call and he put me in touch with a executive with a major voting machine company.
[00:50:07.225 --> 00:50:08.025]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:11.988]  And they said, look, we know Soros, the Chinese are involved.
[00:50:12.844 --> 00:50:16.027]  We want you to investigate it, and we want you to separately bring it out.
[00:50:16.047 --> 00:50:18.348]  And I said, well, if you know it, why do I have to find it?
[00:50:18.368 --> 00:50:19.069]  And they said, look.
[00:50:19.609 --> 00:50:22.572]  I said, oh, because it's classified, and I've got to find it myself.
[00:50:22.872 --> 00:50:23.813]  They said, we're not saying that.
[00:50:24.813 --> 00:50:51.256]  Well, I got a call two days ago from a security firm I hired that were former Army internal security researchers, so they're good researchers, and they ferreted it out and found that 75 plus percent of a major Swiss UBS bank investment firm is owned by the Communist Party Central Committee and by one of their major provinces, and that they put all of this
[00:50:53.129 --> 00:51:00.571]  Money, 400 million, into Dominion on October 7th.
[00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:02.871]  Now, they didn't even use the names.
[00:51:02.891 --> 00:51:06.172]  They used a bunch of cut-out corporations and all of it, but this is confirmed.
[00:51:06.212 --> 00:51:07.533]  We've published this information.
[00:51:08.073 --> 00:51:09.873]  And listen, I'm not a guy that skydives.
[00:51:09.973 --> 00:51:11.474]  I'm not scared of skydiving.
[00:51:11.554 --> 00:51:12.514]  I've cliff-jumped and stuff.
[00:51:12.934 --> 00:51:16.275]  I don't risk my life for a reason, but I just want you to know, this is risking my life right now.
[00:51:16.895 --> 00:51:19.736]  I mean, if you think Hillary was pissed at me before, they're not going to be happy now.
[00:51:21.474 --> 00:51:23.114]  I just hope you realize what you're looking at.
[00:51:23.554 --> 00:51:24.255]  Here's the article.
[00:51:24.275 --> 00:51:26.675]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:51:27.755 --> 00:51:30.876]  You notice there's nobody's name on this because people are so scared to even publish this.
[00:51:31.496 --> 00:51:40.298]  A firm that owns Dominican voting systems received $400 million from Swiss Bank that's 75 plus percent owned by the Chinese government.
[00:51:40.538 --> 00:51:41.398]  It's not just a connection.
[00:51:42.638 --> 00:51:45.439]  And here it all is for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:46.599 --> 00:51:47.819]  So Trump knows all this.
[00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:49.000]  The White House knows all this.
[00:51:51.676 --> 00:51:53.117]  Again, I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:51:53.157 --> 00:51:54.178]  Just give me some of the background.
[00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:59.141]  They put me in touch with a top computer scientist and major people.
[00:51:59.221 --> 00:52:04.064]  And they just, again, it was like, kind of like the guessing game here.
[00:52:04.084 --> 00:52:04.904]  They wouldn't tell me anything.
[00:52:04.924 --> 00:52:09.227]  They just said, look into China, look into Soros, look into foreign bank accounts.
[00:52:10.007 --> 00:52:11.768]  And holy hell, there it is.
[00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:14.490]  Took us almost two and a half weeks to find it.
[00:52:15.882 --> 00:52:19.664]  But we did, and man is it hundreds of pages of treason.
[00:52:19.684 --> 00:52:21.726]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:52:21.766 --> 00:52:27.429]  Staple Street, LILP, and then how it all goes back into the whole thing.
[00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:29.470]  So, there you go.
[00:52:30.711 --> 00:52:42.638]  And by the way, I can tell you that other big national talk show hosts were given this information, but have such short leashes on them, they aren't going to tell you this.
[00:52:42.698 --> 00:52:43.679]  So, this is it.
[00:52:44.099 --> 00:52:45.240]  You want the smoking gun?
[00:52:47.017 --> 00:52:51.422]  I mean, you know, you want the CIA putting the gun right to Kennedy's head and pulling the trigger?
[00:52:51.442 --> 00:52:52.663]  I mean, this is the equivalent of that.
[00:52:52.703 --> 00:52:54.285]  You want hand in the cookie jar.
[00:52:55.592 --> 00:53:01.853]  You walk in, you've thought your neighbor's screwing your wife for a while, but you walk in, he's on top of her, her legs are behind her ears, you see the whole thing.
[00:53:01.933 --> 00:53:04.214]  I mean, this is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:05.014 --> 00:53:08.654]  This is one trillion percent the smoking gun.
[00:53:08.915 --> 00:53:10.475]  And then it just gets worse from there.
[00:53:10.675 --> 00:53:17.976]  The Communist Chinese wired, through a secretive Swiss bank account, $400 million to Dominion on October 7th.
[00:53:20.577 --> 00:53:21.297]  I mean, wow!
[00:53:22.617 --> 00:53:24.218]  I suggest you go get these documents.
[00:53:24.578 --> 00:53:25.458]  I suggest you get them out.
[00:53:25.698 --> 00:53:32.261]  And I don't normally say sources and things like that, but, you know, I want you to know how real this is, okay?
[00:53:33.321 --> 00:53:39.923]  We're in such crisis right now that I haven't given up any confidence that I wasn't supposed to, but that's what's going on.
[00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.884]  And do you think I'm the first person that came to?
[00:53:42.944 --> 00:53:43.084]  No.
[00:53:44.845 --> 00:53:48.146]  Everybody else pisses and are yellow bellies.
[00:53:48.927 --> 00:53:49.667]  The President isn't.
[00:53:50.728 --> 00:53:52.069]  But he's like a quadriplegic.
[00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.830]  He's paralyzed.
[00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:53.650]  No one will help him.
[00:53:53.951 --> 00:53:54.911]  No one below him will do anything.
[00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:55.952]  They're all coward lawyers.
[00:53:55.972 --> 00:54:00.036]  So he's like, he wants to do something, but he can't move his arms.
[00:54:00.596 --> 00:54:03.559]  So he has to look over to Little Info Wars and give us the message.
[00:54:04.179 --> 00:54:06.661]  And he wants to follow the law, so he won't tell us what it is.
[00:54:06.721 --> 00:54:07.502]  It's classified.
[00:54:07.702 --> 00:54:10.124]  And then we have to go around like little beavers and find it.
[00:54:10.504 --> 00:54:11.145]  But we did.
[00:54:12.106 --> 00:54:14.327]  Thanks to you supporting us and keeping us on air.
[00:54:14.367 --> 00:54:14.528]  So.
[00:54:16.144 --> 00:54:16.384]  I don't
[00:54:31.778 --> 00:54:36.100]  The election under him and the government finally following the law and doing what the president said in the executive.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.601]  He's down to maybe 10% last week.
[00:54:39.021 --> 00:54:40.641]  They're all parlaying a new job.
[00:54:40.681 --> 00:54:43.523]  They're all abandoning ship to the chi-coms at the end of the country.
[00:54:43.783 --> 00:54:48.184]  But you see Lin Wood came out, very prestigious lawyer, and he said Trump has to declare martial law.
[00:54:48.645 --> 00:54:52.306]  We're under armed gangs, thugs, communist takeover, Chinese funded.
[00:54:52.886 --> 00:54:55.627]  Lincoln, you could say, went too far, was a tyrant.
[00:54:55.887 --> 00:54:56.988]  But the precedence there
[00:54:57.828 --> 00:55:01.810]  I mean, Trump has a thousand times the reasons to go after this, because it's not an insurrection.
[00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:02.931]  It's not a rebellion.
[00:55:04.112 --> 00:55:08.154]  It's a foreign, multinational takeover of this country.
[00:55:08.574 --> 00:55:16.679]  And so, the President, if he came out from the Resolute Desk, and said it's time to take action, and laid all this evidence out, it would be over.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.440]  So, there you have it.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:20.601]  Let me go ahead and show you this clip.
[00:55:20.621 --> 00:55:22.422]  We're going to go to break, come back with Dr. Steve Puccini.
[00:55:23.831 --> 00:55:24.653]  But here's video.
[00:55:24.714 --> 00:55:25.556]  We know who the guy is.
[00:55:25.576 --> 00:55:26.178]  We tracked him.
[00:55:26.198 --> 00:55:27.040]  Democrat operative.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:27.802]  We know where he worked.
[00:55:27.843 --> 00:55:29.487]  McDonald's and GameStop before this.
[00:55:29.808 --> 00:55:31.333]  We've not released his photo or his name yet.
[00:55:34.298 --> 00:55:34.859]  Javier.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:41.706]  But we have the footage of him in the Key County illegally, whether he knew it or not, going up with a thumb drive, taking it out.
[00:55:41.986 --> 00:55:46.071]  Same thing, 30-something missing hard drives and thumb drives in Pennsylvania, testified.
[00:55:46.611 --> 00:55:48.734]  Here it is, you want more smoking guns?
[00:55:49.114 --> 00:55:54.140]  Here it is, story, Dominion worker reportedly caught manipulating voter data.
[00:55:56.121 --> 00:56:07.693]  In the key county caught on video they reported at the time we're told shut up and under state and federal law this is illegal coming up getting votes off coming back later putting something back on unbelievable here it is.
[00:56:19.214 --> 00:56:21.716]  She's looking at her cell spreadsheet with notes.
[00:56:22.297 --> 00:56:23.198]  Handing it to him.
[00:56:23.218 --> 00:56:29.703]  Nerd Boy's looking for a certain kind of pen for some reason.
[00:56:29.783 --> 00:56:34.387]  He just walks over and kind of slips in the thumb drive.
[00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:49.919]  Those little something waffles off.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.781]  He just pulled a USB out.
[00:56:55.322 --> 00:56:55.842]  Did he?
[00:56:55.942 --> 00:56:56.242]  Yeah.
[00:56:57.883 --> 00:56:58.703]  Where's he going?
[00:56:58.823 --> 00:57:00.284]  He slinks off with it.
[00:57:00.304 --> 00:57:00.584]  Oh my god.
[00:57:00.684 --> 00:57:01.885]  Is he taking it to that laptop?
[00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:02.525]  Yeah.
[00:57:04.446 --> 00:57:07.107]  And this went on everywhere.
[00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:12.991]  That's exactly what he did.
[00:57:13.071 --> 00:57:14.751]  It should not be connected.
[00:57:14.911 --> 00:57:19.893]  Doing some important work over here, are you?
[00:57:19.993 --> 00:57:26.434]  After all, he's fighting Hitler, right?
[00:57:26.514 --> 00:57:29.175]  Trying to get us out of all the wars?
[00:57:29.195 --> 00:57:31.395]  Look at the left, battling to keep us in wars.
[00:57:31.936 --> 00:57:33.896]  They actually call themselves the Rebel Alliance.
[00:57:34.136 --> 00:57:36.977]  That guy thinks he's Luke Skywalker, working for the shy cops.
[00:57:40.376 --> 00:57:45.120]  Those look like files from a distance, but I can't really tell.
[00:57:45.741 --> 00:57:46.602]  And then he wanders off.
[00:57:46.622 --> 00:57:47.843]  They go, yeah, he has a thumb drive.
[00:57:47.863 --> 00:57:48.103]  Big deal.
[00:57:48.123 --> 00:57:51.686]  They go, you're not supposed to plug one in to the main tabulation computer, by the way.
[00:57:52.146 --> 00:57:54.208]  He's at the main tabulation, the whole county.
[00:57:55.449 --> 00:57:58.011]  And then he takes some stuff off, leaves with those, brings them back.
[00:57:58.432 --> 00:58:00.614]  What do you think happened?
[00:58:04.763 --> 00:58:13.449]  If you've ever had a cat and a dog, you know the dogs get in the cat box, and they're real guilty when they go underneath all the crap, and they have this look on their face.
[00:58:14.049 --> 00:58:18.832]  When a guy wanders off, he's wearing a mask, you can see him, he looks really suspicious.
[00:58:22.074 --> 00:58:25.456]  But notice they've got all the masks, and then later he comes back.
[00:58:31.152 --> 00:58:32.712]  I got a baby bumblebee.
[00:58:35.633 --> 00:58:38.034]  He first waits to see if anybody is going to tackle him and he comes back.
[00:58:42.055 --> 00:58:43.636]  I shouldn't be laughing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:43.656 --> 00:58:45.056]  We're going to come right back after the break.
[00:58:46.057 --> 00:58:53.139]  Remember, I won't be here if it isn't for your word of mouth and your prayers, so I suggest you share all these articles and breaking videos that are coffin nails if you share them.
[00:58:54.505 --> 00:58:56.846]  I would flood all the state houses with these videos and articles.
[00:58:57.386 --> 00:58:58.366]  I would flood everybody.
[00:58:58.446 --> 00:59:01.327]  And I would go to m4wrestore.com with promo code PATRIOT.
[00:59:01.927 --> 00:59:03.568]  It's only going this week during Cyber Week.
[00:59:03.888 --> 00:59:06.049]  Additional 10% off on the already big discounts.
[00:59:06.649 --> 00:59:09.410]  You might want to fund the Second American Revolution while getting great products at the same time.
[00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:13.871]  But regardless, all you guys put us in attack formation, so we'll keep fighting till the end.
[00:59:15.252 --> 00:59:15.752]  Stay with us!
[00:59:17.799 --> 00:59:23.683]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the most historic times in world history, certainly the most important in American history.
[00:59:24.424 --> 00:59:32.410]  Big exclusive article, firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million from Swiss bank with connection to Chinese government before election.
[00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:41.196]  And imagine, the White House knows this, the Pentagon knows this, and three weeks ago told us to investigate it.
[00:59:43.066 --> 00:59:46.789]  Because they weren't going to give us classified information and violate the law, unlike the Democrats.
[00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:53.174]  So we went and reverse-engineered the whole thing, and dammit, we have the SEC filings, InfoWars.com.
[00:59:53.194 --> 00:59:59.318]  By the way, there have been ongoing DOS and all sorts of attacks from China trying to shut us down.
[00:59:59.859 --> 01:00:02.881]  So if I could drive out of my office and get shot in the head, remember, this is a war.
[01:00:03.241 --> 01:00:05.363]  This is the real deal, folks.
[01:00:05.383 --> 01:00:06.784]  You need to understand this.
[01:00:08.206 --> 01:00:10.267]  That shows how paralyzed and cut off the President is.
[01:00:10.287 --> 01:00:18.852]  They had the former Deputy Attorney General, or Acting Attorney General, and he's a good guy, on Fox right now, and he's like, well, none of these state legislatures or courts will stand up for the President.
[01:00:19.412 --> 01:00:26.296]  Well, finally a court said, oh, you can hold the files for 10 days in Georgia, but now they're saying, oh, no, it's proprietary, we can't let you do that.
[01:00:26.737 --> 01:00:27.117]  You're not.
[01:00:28.359 --> 01:00:30.161]  The individual who just finally got identified.
[01:00:30.201 --> 01:00:32.083]  We weren't going to identify him.
[01:00:32.143 --> 01:00:43.014]  Dominion employee identified, allegedly caught on video downloading data on USB, plugging into laptop, manipulating data, and then palming the USB and waddling out.
[01:00:43.895 --> 01:00:48.799]  And we've got his name, Javier Corey, as we told you.
[01:00:50.586 --> 01:00:52.808]  I wasn't going to break it myself, let Gateway Pundit do it.
[01:00:53.628 --> 01:00:54.769]  Stay in attack formation.
[01:00:55.449 --> 01:00:57.931]  So it's all coming out.
[01:00:58.011 --> 01:01:01.393]  So attorney Lynn Wood says Marshall Law Limited to stop this.
[01:01:01.473 --> 01:01:03.734]  Well yeah, this is globalist Marshall Law.
[01:01:05.015 --> 01:01:14.100]  Dr. Steve Pachinick's best-selling author, wrote books with Tom Clancy, made major films, ran the State Department of Psychological Operations, MIT trained, he's also a Harvard psychiatrist.
[01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:17.136]  You know, I'm Mr. Anti-Martial Law.
[01:01:17.176 --> 01:01:18.217]  You're against the police state as well.
[01:01:18.297 --> 01:01:21.699]  This is a globalist corporate police state overthrowing the country.
[01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:23.160]  There was a huge Trump landslide.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:28.944]  We know he was getting double, triple the numbers he got of margins of victory.
[01:01:28.984 --> 01:01:33.047]  Not 1% in battlegrounds, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 until they shut it down.
[01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.309]  What do you call this moment we're at?
[01:01:35.369 --> 01:01:37.650]  Because America knows the truth.
[01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:39.892]  It doesn't matter how long CNN gaslights us.
[01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:41.633]  What do you expect to happen here?
[01:01:41.673 --> 01:01:42.594]  And is Lynwood right?
[01:01:43.394 --> 01:01:45.015]  And what would that martial law look like?
[01:01:45.055 --> 01:01:56.999]  Because we know, if Trump showed any strength that had federal troops, SWAT team, Soros, and a few of the globalists, they would roll over, piss on themselves, and turn state's evidence in five seconds.
[01:01:57.399 --> 01:02:00.340]  But instead, we just bow down to the mouse that roars, Dr. Buchanan.
[01:02:02.037 --> 01:02:14.160]  Well, let me remind you that a couple of weeks ago and several months ago, I told you that I was told by my fellow countrymen in Cyber Command
[01:02:15.177 --> 01:02:31.890]  That I was to announce on your show, Owen Shroyer's show, that we had put QFS watermarks on all the ballots, we had monitored all the machines on Dominion, and we had expected everything to come out, and it came out of cyber control.
[01:02:32.936 --> 01:02:37.978]  I don't have the same fear factor that you have, but I do respect you.
[01:02:38.158 --> 01:02:40.899]  Number one, we don't need martial law.
[01:02:40.979 --> 01:02:52.682]  What we have in effect now is we have prepared the Sting operation, which I announced here on Alex Jones, because I was given that permission by exactly Cyber Command.
[01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:57.704]  And let me explain what I mean by that and what is happening from my point of view.
[01:02:58.644 --> 01:03:09.412]  Number one, gentlemen like Keith Alexander, who was head of Cyber Command, G2 Army Intelligence, trained another general by the name of Nakasone.
[01:03:09.532 --> 01:03:28.185]  General Nakasone is the third generation Japanese-American, a war hero, four-star general, who is in the White House, has been in the White House for over four years, and is the man in charge of having put in all the watermarks, all the cyber,
[01:03:28.814 --> 01:03:31.775]  Some people say you're making this up and you're full of it.
[01:03:31.815 --> 01:03:32.875]  Let me just say what we know.
[01:03:32.955 --> 01:03:33.055]  Okay?
[01:03:33.195 --> 01:03:34.935]  And I think you're an incredible person.
[01:03:34.955 --> 01:03:35.415]  I respect you.
[01:03:35.495 --> 01:03:37.296]  You've been really accurate in the past.
[01:03:37.316 --> 01:03:38.236]  So that goes a long way for me.
[01:03:38.256 --> 01:03:39.196]  Trump set up a task force
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.765]  An executive order on election fraud to track it and control it two years ago.
[01:04:03.405 --> 01:04:14.078]  We know, at least at the software levels, they had Homeland Security and Cyber Command trying to monitor it, and Trump was over at the, you know, Naval building where the Vice President lives on that night.
[01:04:14.198 --> 01:04:14.999]  We know all that.
[01:04:15.479 --> 01:04:21.900]  I know that the White House contacted me and said, look into China and Dominion, and sure as hell there it is in the SEC.
[01:04:22.041 --> 01:04:25.621]  So clearly, I mean, Trump said they're going to try to steal it, and these ballots are a fraud.
[01:04:25.641 --> 01:04:29.602]  So he said, my only question is how much the government's loyal, how much isn't.
[01:04:30.102 --> 01:04:35.283]  And you know, I just hope that people aren't being over-optimistic to you, because they're acting like Biden's about to be sworn in.
[01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:38.944]  I'm not an optimist.
[01:04:39.224 --> 01:04:39.965]  I'm a realist.
[01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:45.991]  Exactly what I'm told and I understand what's happening.
[01:04:46.051 --> 01:04:48.092]  People can attack me if they want.
[01:04:48.132 --> 01:04:50.274]  They can read my history if they want.
[01:04:50.794 --> 01:04:52.495]  I'm not here to apologize.
[01:04:52.595 --> 01:04:54.296]  I'm not here to make excuses.
[01:04:54.596 --> 01:04:57.738]  This is what I've been saying all along.
[01:04:57.998 --> 01:05:00.580]  I said that Biden, we knew he was corrupt.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:07.704]  Number two, we know that Simon and Schuster will have a merger with Random House.
[01:05:08.539 --> 01:05:13.142]  Because Simon & Schuster made all of their money from being anti-Trump.
[01:05:13.282 --> 01:05:17.645]  Now, we can stop that if you want, and that's one of the reasons why I go on.
[01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:20.566]  It's a $2.2 billion acquisition.
[01:05:20.746 --> 01:05:26.230]  At the same time, I can tell you that Nakasone has been running a very effective
[01:05:27.232 --> 01:05:34.080]  Uh, monitoring system and that we have deployed military elements all over the country.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:44.111]  I can tell you that in North Florida, the amount of planes that have come in with more equipment with a regular Army National Guard and others.
[01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:46.212]  Has increased markedly.
[01:05:46.532 --> 01:05:53.075]  I can tell you that at the same time, John Roberts of the Supreme Court may have a problem.
[01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:54.356]  He is a sick man.
[01:05:54.376 --> 01:05:56.577]  He's had a history of seizures.
[01:05:56.657 --> 01:06:03.580]  We know that his interpretation of corruption is what we call the minimalist quid pro quo corruption.
[01:06:04.116 --> 01:06:12.623]  Meaning that in many ways he has allowed corruption in the system to expand both at the state level and the national level.
[01:06:13.143 --> 01:06:14.084]  Trump knew this.
[01:06:14.344 --> 01:06:23.972]  At the same Trump, Trump knew that Krebs, whoever this gentleman was, went to George Mason University and was head of cybersecurity at home there.
[01:06:24.432 --> 01:06:28.274]  Security was not even relevant to the entire situation.
[01:06:44.525 --> 01:06:48.866]  Trump being in the background waiting for the courts to take action is one view of why he's doing it.
[01:06:49.066 --> 01:06:56.688]  Other views are he knows this is really going on and this is this big sting and he knows he has all this incredible evidence.
[01:06:56.788 --> 01:06:58.089]  I hear him on Fox News.
[01:06:58.529 --> 01:06:59.349]  I hear the few interviews.
[01:06:59.389 --> 01:07:02.510]  He sounds more confident and more happy than he's ever sounded.
[01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:07.932]  So if you're going off body language, he either knows he's got them or he's being fed a lot of bull and so are you.
[01:07:07.972 --> 01:07:12.393]  But regardless, we know he set up this whole surveillance system on the election two years ago.
[01:07:12.853 --> 01:07:13.713]  So that is going on.
[01:07:13.753 --> 01:07:16.054]  We know there is watermarks at many state levels.
[01:07:16.335 --> 01:07:17.815]  The question is, was Homeland Security involved in that?
[01:07:18.155 --> 01:07:24.538]  Regardless, we now have this smoking gun out of Switzerland with the Chinese government funding Dominion.
[01:07:24.798 --> 01:07:26.319]  That's open and shut right there for me.
[01:07:26.639 --> 01:07:28.220]  StevePachinik.com is the website.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.820]  We'll be right back with Steve Pachinik.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.541]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:31.401 --> 01:07:33.202]  Little less talk, little more action.
[01:07:34.622 --> 01:07:38.124]  How do they put a corpse like Joe Biden in who can hardly walk or talk?
[01:07:39.485 --> 01:07:44.908]  How do they put Kamala Harris, who polled at less than half a percent with Democrat voters, even lower with blacks?
[01:07:44.968 --> 01:07:49.631]  I mean, she's incredibly disingenuous and faker than a plastic banana.
[01:07:51.952 --> 01:07:58.536]  And then the massive evidence of fraud and the media saying there is no evidence, and it's just founting out like an exploded dam.
[01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:09.331]  And then you've got Hunter Biden and the laptop confirmed, a Chinese agent, his dad bragging he's a Chinese agent, he's a Russian agent, everything they said about Trump.
[01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:15.555]  And then they're up there, oh, I'm the office of President-elect, and then Trump's going through the process through the states.
[01:08:16.115 --> 01:08:19.216]  And I get it, he wants to go to the Supreme Court, he knows his political operatives in the other states.
[01:08:19.477 --> 01:08:24.039]  They're having incredible hearings where they put on, have computer scientists, eyewitnesses of the fraud.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.981]  They say that the counting stopped, it doesn't stop.
[01:08:28.221 --> 01:08:29.982]  They say water mains break, they don't break.
[01:08:32.256 --> 01:08:36.339]  Then they're doing a recount, and then the Dominion servers crash in Georgia so they can put up fake numbers.
[01:08:36.739 --> 01:08:45.804]  I mean, they have really... I agree that this is a sting by God, because down the road, Biden and this attempted theft will just blow up in their face bigger, even if they're able to get rid of Trump.
[01:08:46.405 --> 01:08:53.029]  But if Congress doesn't stand up, if the electors on December 15th, Dr. Steve Mnuchinik, don't say no to this fraud,
[01:08:53.849 --> 01:08:55.890]  Then they will put Biden in, and Trump says he'll go.
[01:08:55.990 --> 01:09:01.792]  So, if there is these watermarks and all this proof, and I believe you talked to those sources who told you, so I believe you're in good faith.
[01:09:01.812 --> 01:09:02.632]  I think you're a good person.
[01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:05.393]  When do we see the cards on the table?
[01:09:05.453 --> 01:09:06.193]  What's about to happen?
[01:09:06.413 --> 01:09:07.714]  Like, why would the White House
[01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:10.291]  See, to me, this doesn't mean I'm important.
[01:09:10.552 --> 01:09:12.952]  It means the President's a quadriplegic, politically cut off.
[01:09:13.353 --> 01:09:18.614]  Why would they get me to go after Soros and the Chi-Coms?
[01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:22.296]  And then it's true, we get the smoking gun documents, but it takes us two and a half weeks to get it.
[01:09:22.396 --> 01:09:22.716]  Why?
[01:09:22.976 --> 01:09:24.656]  I mean, if they have this, why?
[01:09:26.297 --> 01:09:28.258]  Let me explain something.
[01:09:28.278 --> 01:09:35.320]  The one thing I do, and I've done in the past, and I've been involved with the Nixon transition, remember we had a
[01:09:36.244 --> 01:09:37.784]  A quandary with Nixon.
[01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:40.005]  We had a Watergate situation.
[01:09:40.265 --> 01:09:45.307]  We were involved and I was involved in what's called a soft coup, the transfer of power.
[01:09:45.847 --> 01:09:49.588]  Then we had Iran-Contra under Reagan, where we had a problem.
[01:09:49.828 --> 01:09:51.228]  I had to be involved in that.
[01:09:51.288 --> 01:09:53.429]  We maintained that and quieted it.
[01:09:54.198 --> 01:10:03.962]  What I've been told and what I'm saying to you, and I appreciate the fact that you're getting very excited, but the reality is the game has already been played.
[01:10:04.202 --> 01:10:08.604]  What's happening is that Trump anticipated most of this.
[01:10:08.784 --> 01:10:16.988]  Trump actually and the intelligence community really picked you as the source for which I was to announce
[01:10:17.509 --> 01:10:19.170]  What they wanted me to announce.
[01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:23.112]  And I'm not just a certain person or students because I don't get paid.
[01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.793]  I'm really not interested in promotion.
[01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:31.476]  I really don't garner anything other than being a citizen warrior.
[01:10:31.496 --> 01:10:37.800]  And you were chosen as the mainstream media as opposed to The New York Times, The Post.
[01:10:38.579 --> 01:10:45.261]  So although you're getting excited, what is happening all around you, Alex, is exactly what we expected.
[01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.802]  The New York Times is going under.
[01:10:48.142 --> 01:10:50.363]  The Washington Post is going under.
[01:10:50.503 --> 01:10:52.624]  Simon & Schuster is going under.
[01:10:52.644 --> 01:10:59.006]  And they're trying to make the best of it to make a merger with the other houses.
[01:10:59.586 --> 01:11:03.229]  At the same time, there are arrests being made in Florida.
[01:11:03.369 --> 01:11:14.116]  Over 300 to 700 people were arrested in northern Florida, southern Florida, with regards to this illegal activity and pedophilia.
[01:11:14.176 --> 01:11:16.798]  That's the other element that we've been looking at.
[01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:21.341]  The military has been deployed all over the United States.
[01:11:22.223 --> 01:11:23.604]  We're quiet about it.
[01:11:23.924 --> 01:11:41.877]  And at the same time, I will guarantee you Biden will not become president of the United States because right now he's wearing possibly an ankle bracelet because he said he has a little bit of problem on his ankle and he's, you know, he's twisted his ankle.
[01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:44.052]  I don't believe that's so.
[01:11:44.132 --> 01:11:45.755]  You might look at that problem.
[01:11:45.855 --> 01:11:50.703]  So, in effect, what you're seeing now... Doc, now that sounds like Q stuff.
[01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:52.106]  He's got an ankle bracelet.
[01:11:52.226 --> 01:11:53.568]  I mean, I hope so.
[01:11:53.589 --> 01:11:55.231]  I hope he gets a different type of bracelet.
[01:11:57.697 --> 01:12:01.138]  Look, I can't get excited the way you can, Alex.
[01:12:01.198 --> 01:12:02.798]  That's the reason why I come on.
[01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.179]  I mean, this is not unusual for me.
[01:12:05.319 --> 01:12:07.040]  We've said it a long time ago.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.300]  Well, I want to believe you.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:11.001]  So in 50 days, let me tell you this, buddy.
[01:12:11.181 --> 01:12:17.203]  I am going to, I'm just going to, if you're right in 50 days, you are going to be the king of the planet to me.
[01:12:17.283 --> 01:12:18.483]  I already really like you.
[01:12:18.803 --> 01:12:20.483]  You've given me great info over the years.
[01:12:20.724 --> 01:12:22.224]  You've been on the show for 19 years.
[01:12:22.284 --> 01:12:23.604]  It's been really accurate info.
[01:12:23.964 --> 01:12:25.565]  So I just, I just hope you're right.
[01:12:26.912 --> 01:12:28.673]  Well, let me put it this way.
[01:12:29.254 --> 01:12:31.256]  What exactly is the alternative?
[01:12:31.356 --> 01:12:34.518]  Is Biden coming in with a history of corruption?
[01:12:34.618 --> 01:12:35.059]  No, I get it.
[01:12:35.099 --> 01:12:38.702]  If we believe he's a criminal and going down, that will give people confidence and he'll be defeated.
[01:12:38.762 --> 01:12:40.243]  And we do have incredible evidence.
[01:12:40.583 --> 01:12:41.304]  This is insane.
[01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:42.265]  The Democrats would try this.
[01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:43.686]  Talk about self-destruction.
[01:12:44.767 --> 01:12:47.089]  Well, but that's exactly what happened.
[01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:52.233]  Last time I was on your show, you asked me, what is the dynamics of the self-destruction?
[01:12:52.733 --> 01:12:54.635]  I told you it's arrogance,
[01:12:55.307 --> 01:13:01.410]  The self-aggrandizement, denial, distortion, and exactly what's happening.
[01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:19.578]  And the reason for it is because they can no longer admit the reality that Trump, whoever he might be, and he's going to be ruthless, and he is ruthless, but at the same time, he understood when he came into the administration that it was so corrupt.
[01:13:20.018 --> 01:13:25.361]  Both Republicans and Democrats were so corrupt that he had to rely on special forces.
[01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:26.382]  Okay, then give us a timeline.
[01:13:26.422 --> 01:13:27.542]  We're 50 days out.
[01:13:27.923 --> 01:13:29.363]  What do you expect to start seeing happening?
[01:13:29.383 --> 01:13:30.944]  You're going to see it by December 14th.
[01:13:30.984 --> 01:13:34.386]  You're going to see the electoral colleges go back to Trump.
[01:13:34.866 --> 01:13:38.248]  Basically, he will remain in power in January.
[01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:44.672]  You have special forces, a unit underneath, now, the Secretary of Defense Miller.
[01:13:45.052 --> 01:13:47.854]  We've deployed all... By the way, you did say a month ago,
[01:13:48.614 --> 01:13:49.915]  Well, it's not an accident.
[01:13:49.935 --> 01:13:51.835]  I don't make prognostications like that.
[01:13:51.855 --> 01:13:53.696]  I said Gina Haspel has to go.
[01:13:53.716 --> 01:13:54.216]  She left.
[01:13:54.236 --> 01:13:56.236]  But there's going to be more serious repercussions for the CIA.
[01:13:56.256 --> 01:13:58.717]  Esper had to go.
[01:13:58.737 --> 01:13:59.057]  He's left.
[01:14:12.208 --> 01:14:18.291]  The CIA and Brennan, Obama, Clinton, and the Bushes have to be held accountable.
[01:14:18.691 --> 01:14:20.172]  This is what you're watching.
[01:14:20.312 --> 01:14:26.694]  Is that why Brennan said two weeks ago, Trump's more dangerous than ever, must be removed now, we can't leave him in until the inauguration?
[01:14:26.714 --> 01:14:28.035]  Because he looks scared.
[01:14:28.275 --> 01:14:30.076]  He's always looked very arrogant, Brennan does.
[01:14:30.116 --> 01:14:30.916]  He looks scared now.
[01:14:31.857 --> 01:14:39.100]  He has to be scared because he knows that the military intelligence, the people I work with, the key
[01:14:40.425 --> 01:14:46.931]  Alex Anderson, he was put Keith Alexander went just before at the same time to Amazon.
[01:14:47.151 --> 01:14:55.520]  Now, the reason we put him in Amazon is because Amazon is the largest private cloud computing service in the world.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:15:00.364]  At the same time, we have his protege, Nakasone, in the White House.
[01:15:00.784 --> 01:15:14.135]  At the same time, I've got Boykin Special Forces underneath Miller, who brought in the Special Forces and took it out of the Department of Defense and under the Army and brought it right to the top.
[01:15:14.575 --> 01:15:17.698]  So everything I told you is happening right now.
[01:15:18.198 --> 01:15:20.160]  The fact that you're getting excited
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.020]  I can't help that, Alex.
[01:15:22.421 --> 01:15:23.501]  I am what I am.
[01:15:23.681 --> 01:15:25.942]  I'm a person who says what I know.
[01:15:26.502 --> 01:15:28.182]  I can't make up the stories.
[01:15:28.282 --> 01:15:31.983]  If I did, that's why I sell fiction underneath the clancy.
[01:15:32.084 --> 01:15:32.664]  No, I hear you.
[01:15:32.724 --> 01:15:33.704]  Well, I mean, I know this.
[01:15:34.124 --> 01:15:34.564]  I know this.
[01:15:34.624 --> 01:15:36.445]  I got contacted by the White House.
[01:15:37.426 --> 01:15:41.407]  And they told me, look into this company, look into the Chinese, and sure as hell it was all there.
[01:15:41.867 --> 01:15:42.847]  And now we're breaking it.
[01:15:42.927 --> 01:15:46.528]  So, I mean, I think that just means they probably went to Fox and everybody else wouldn't break it.
[01:15:46.568 --> 01:15:49.449]  But this is the total proof on Infowars.com right now.
[01:15:49.689 --> 01:15:51.709]  I mean, Dr. Pucinich, is that not bombshell?
[01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:55.690]  That the Chinese put in $400 million into Dominion a month before the election?
[01:15:56.751 --> 01:15:56.911]  No.
[01:15:57.451 --> 01:16:00.972]  And the reason why is we knew that Dominion was corrupt.
[01:16:01.252 --> 01:16:04.773]  We understood exactly what the Chinese and Xi Ping did.
[01:16:05.033 --> 01:16:06.333]  Actually, believe it or not,
[01:16:07.068 --> 01:16:12.289]  Because of your show and that video that I did with you, it was sent to China.
[01:16:12.789 --> 01:16:22.851]  And believe it or not, I got a call from what I call my Chinese nanny, who's been my control officer in China for the past 30 years.
[01:16:23.252 --> 01:16:29.953]  That meant President Xi and the Public Bureau of Safety in China personally had to call me up.
[01:16:30.533 --> 01:16:46.705]  Oh, three weeks ago because of the show that I went on on your show, Alex, to explain that they are not looking for any trouble to say that it was an excellent show, meaning that they don't want to get into a problem situation, whatever their
[01:16:47.725 --> 01:16:49.326]  Investments are in Dominion.
[01:16:49.346 --> 01:16:50.946]  You have to understand one thing.
[01:16:51.066 --> 01:16:54.907]  Dominion was a corrupt company from its very start.
[01:16:54.947 --> 01:16:55.287]  Stay there.
[01:16:55.467 --> 01:16:57.808]  Let's talk about what you see happening next, Pachinic.
[01:16:57.848 --> 01:17:00.608]  And I pray to God you're right, because I know the evidence is overwhelming.
[01:17:00.628 --> 01:17:01.588]  But this is just incredible.
[01:17:01.608 --> 01:17:02.949]  StevePachinic.com is his website.
[01:17:03.309 --> 01:17:04.609]  Infowars.com is ours.
[01:17:04.969 --> 01:17:07.450]  Get the Dominion article out, folks.
[01:17:08.348 --> 01:17:16.140]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to be playing hooky in the next two hours when Paul Joseph Watson has Candace Owens, an amazing guest on.
[01:17:16.741 --> 01:17:22.049]  I am so busy with breaking news and documents and intel that I have to go off air.
[01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:29.395]  And tomorrow, we'll have giant breaking news here for you on air with the information I'm going to be getting.
[01:17:29.415 --> 01:17:30.215]  But it's so huge.
[01:17:30.776 --> 01:17:32.317]  I'm going to have to go off air in about 10 minutes.
[01:17:33.118 --> 01:17:34.419]  Paul Joseph Watson will take over.
[01:17:34.839 --> 01:17:36.701]  I'll probably be back on the Royal Room this evening.
[01:17:37.722 --> 01:17:40.564]  But you'll see some of the big news tomorrow on multiple fronts.
[01:17:40.584 --> 01:17:41.925]  We're entering that zeitgeist point.
[01:17:42.525 --> 01:17:48.350]  And Stephen Shinnick, you know, has never really steered us wrong on things.
[01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:50.292]  I hope he's right, but this is what I do know.
[01:17:52.148 --> 01:17:55.711]  I am a public figure, so I get a gauge of the public.
[01:17:56.732 --> 01:18:00.796]  And I went from, you know, every hundredth hand I shake, somebody's saying, F you Russian agent.
[01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:02.157]  That never even happens anymore.
[01:18:03.338 --> 01:18:08.763]  And now it's young women, it's black people, it's Hispanics, it's old people, it's Asians, it's Muslims.
[01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:11.585]  Infowars is totally on the side.
[01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:13.047]  Guys, I can't walk down the street now.
[01:18:13.187 --> 01:18:14.828]  The cars just start stopping, okay?
[01:18:14.908 --> 01:18:16.990]  And that's not about Alex is a big guy, I'm great.
[01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.772]  That's, people are really awake.
[01:18:19.815 --> 01:18:26.692]  And so at a sick Machiavellian level, I hope they actually try to put Biden in because he's so unpopular and it's such a joke to put Skeletor in there.
[01:18:26.712 --> 01:18:27.534]  No one's going to buy it.
[01:18:29.039 --> 01:18:31.840]  So that's something that's positive that should be added.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.680]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:37.321]  We don't really promote our radio affiliates, TV and cable affiliates, because the left targets them and harasses them.
[01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:38.621]  So we don't put a list of them up.
[01:18:39.222 --> 01:18:43.483]  We're gaining 20 cable systems a week right now.
[01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:46.043]  We're gaining TV stations every day.
[01:18:46.183 --> 01:18:48.484]  I was just back there looking at a map this week.
[01:18:49.204 --> 01:18:54.065]  Over 100 cable systems as people leave Fox News and the rest of it around the country.
[01:18:54.105 --> 01:18:56.306]  So I want you to know, keeping us on air,
[01:18:57.469 --> 01:18:57.609]  Yes.
[01:19:14.376 --> 01:19:18.938]  The DNA Force, the PQQ, the CoQ10, sold out for a year because of the shutdowns and things.
[01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:22.240]  We now have Alpha Power for your libido, your stamina, people love so much.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.080]  That's back in stock.
[01:19:23.401 --> 01:19:37.007]  But just keep financially supporting us because we're having fabulous success despite the bans online with radio stations, TV stations, cable stations, and just huge audience increase, five-fold, you know, what we had just a year ago on our own streams.
[01:19:37.047 --> 01:19:39.349]  So thank God for your prayers and support.
[01:19:39.609 --> 01:19:41.770]  But now's the time to fund us more than ever.
[01:19:42.775 --> 01:19:45.057]  Because I'm spending everything I've got in this fight.
[01:19:45.077 --> 01:19:47.219]  Dr. Steve Pchenik, we really appreciate you.
[01:19:47.279 --> 01:19:48.980]  I'm trying to give people the truth, the good news.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:57.166]  I'm seeing a major bellwether, however this cookie crumbles, but other key points you'd like to add about what's coming up, what you think the American people should be doing right now?
[01:19:58.647 --> 01:20:08.975]  Number one, let's remember, it was on your show that I said a year ago, or two years ago, John Bolton should never have been brought into the White House.
[01:20:09.435 --> 01:20:10.776]  That turned out to be correct.
[01:20:11.448 --> 01:20:16.311]  It was on your show that I said Tony Fauci is totally out of control.
[01:20:16.892 --> 01:20:20.514]  He was my intern at Cornell University Medical College.
[01:20:20.654 --> 01:20:26.258]  I've said he's an excellent medical doctor that has no capability to run an epidemic.
[01:20:26.318 --> 01:20:29.441]  It was I who ran the epidemic for Ebola.
[01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:35.705]  There was no one on the Biden team who ran the epidemic for Ebola because I had to use the military.
[01:20:36.681 --> 01:20:42.022]  So I'm telling you, Beijing called me directly because of the show that you're doing right now.
[01:20:42.282 --> 01:20:48.443]  And we wanted to use you as the main thoroughfare for that announcement.
[01:20:48.624 --> 01:21:00.106]  The last part that you have to know is that ironically, one of my neighbors in northern Florida increased the fencing and the size of Gitmo by two
[01:21:01.567 --> 01:21:08.290]  100%.
[01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:08.290]  In other words, I have a neighbor who's in charge of wire and fencing for prisons.
[01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:18.054]  And he went to Gitmo a year ago and increased the size of Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay, by over 100%.
[01:21:18.094 --> 01:21:25.997]  Why did the Justice Department a week ago change it to add electric chair and hanging and firing squad again?
[01:21:27.062 --> 01:21:34.327]  Because Trump, let me go back to the point, Trump understood exactly what was about to happen.
[01:21:34.888 --> 01:21:42.173]  A month ago I said to you, he Sun Tzu, the art of war is to allow your enemies to make all those mistakes.
[01:21:42.753 --> 01:21:47.977]  A year ago, or two years ago, he had passed a national executive order
[01:21:48.687 --> 01:21:54.333]  Including the concept of treason and national treason and what you're seeing now.
[01:21:54.893 --> 01:22:00.519]  Forget the Chinese influence, what you're seeing... So is this like when a fish bites on the line, you let him run with it till they get tired?
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.061]  Correct.
[01:22:02.201 --> 01:22:06.345]  And what's happening now in every state, every county,
[01:22:06.806 --> 01:22:15.273]  We know the governors, the political operatives, the people on the ground who are corrupt.
[01:22:15.413 --> 01:22:17.755]  This is a massive, massive amount.
[01:22:17.836 --> 01:22:27.944]  Why do you think that federal judge, Batten, first said yes, save the servers, then don't save the servers, then said yes, do save them, in the same day, three times?
[01:22:27.984 --> 01:22:28.885]  That's unprecedented.
[01:22:31.741 --> 01:22:36.543]  We already know which servers have been compromised.
[01:22:36.583 --> 01:22:39.463]  We know exactly what has been happening.
[01:22:39.603 --> 01:22:46.606]  There's a reason why military intelligence and non-civilian intelligence was brought in.
[01:22:46.866 --> 01:22:49.967]  And what you have to understand, and I've said it to you since 9-11,
[01:22:51.391 --> 01:23:16.179]  This is the payback from all of those of us who served in the military, and particularly military intelligence, for the 9-11 false flags created by the Bushes, the concepts and the irregularities created by the Clintons, the total nonsense narrative created by Brennan and Obama, who was nothing more than a Manchurian candidate
[01:23:16.659 --> 01:23:22.542]  This is all the payback for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that we didn't have to go to.
[01:23:23.002 --> 01:23:31.006]  You have to understand it on the level of those of us who had to go overseas to fight wars that were created by the CIA.
[01:23:31.446 --> 01:23:45.232]  And let me go back to the greatest president we had, Eisenhower, who once said in the 1950s that the CIA has created a legacy of ashes unknown in the history of this country.
[01:23:45.842 --> 01:23:46.122]  That's 1950.
[01:23:47.544 --> 01:24:01.778]  So you imagine what's been happening for the next 50 years that was created by the CIA, political operatives like the Bushes, the Clintons, the Obamas, and so forth and so on.
[01:24:02.279 --> 01:24:08.826]  So this has been going on for 40 to 50 years and we were fortunate, or God sent us a man,
[01:24:09.426 --> 01:24:19.034]  Who was a businessman who decided to help us out thanks to his wife Melania and his sons Eric and Trump Jr.
[01:24:19.114 --> 01:24:23.458]  and all the others Ivanka and all the other people in his family.
[01:24:23.518 --> 01:24:27.221]  They came forth to serve the country not to serve themselves.
[01:24:27.241 --> 01:24:34.087]  We know Trump's lost most his wealth during this but I go there in the breaks Fox News has Biden measuring the drapes and they're like
[01:24:34.107 --> 01:24:35.968]  Well, Trump will still be powerful as a Republican leader.
[01:24:36.248 --> 01:24:38.029]  I mean, even Fox News says Trump's done.
[01:24:38.289 --> 01:24:41.710]  So, I don't... What happens if you're right and all this gaslighting fails?
[01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:43.991]  Is that just totally in the mainstream media?
[01:24:44.051 --> 01:24:44.792]  The zombie media?
[01:24:44.832 --> 01:24:46.232]  Because... The dinosaur media?
[01:24:46.252 --> 01:24:52.695]  Because they'll be... I mean, they are just completely committed, fraudulently, that Joe Biden is the President-elect.
[01:24:53.735 --> 01:24:54.996]  Well, it's incorrect.
[01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:57.497]  First of all, what happens to dinosaurs?
[01:24:57.637 --> 01:24:58.217]  They die.
[01:24:58.237 --> 01:24:59.538]  They eliminate it.
[01:24:59.938 --> 01:25:02.439]  Alex, when I said to you 20 years ago,
[01:25:03.476 --> 01:25:07.678]  We have decided to use you as the main channel.
[01:25:07.898 --> 01:25:09.278]  I've said it repeatedly.
[01:25:09.458 --> 01:25:14.721]  Alternative media, the Alex Jones Show, became mainstream media.
[01:25:14.741 --> 01:25:15.921]  Now, how did that happen?
[01:25:16.021 --> 01:25:23.384]  Over 20 years, where increasingly the New York Times was funded with more money, became irrelevant.
[01:25:24.219 --> 01:25:28.022]  ABC, NBC, CBS, irrelevant.
[01:25:28.622 --> 01:25:30.824]  All the TV shows, irrelevant.
[01:25:31.184 --> 01:25:32.665]  Hollywood, dead.
[01:25:33.326 --> 01:25:34.046]  What happened?
[01:25:34.307 --> 01:25:34.927]  Netflix.
[01:25:35.247 --> 01:25:36.088]  What's happened?
[01:25:36.308 --> 01:25:37.049]  Alex Jones.
[01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:38.970]  Just what we predicted.
[01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:44.014]  Don't they get that the more they lie, people go with the opposite of what they say?
[01:25:44.294 --> 01:25:48.597]  They're not even smart enough to Machiavelli say the truth because the public would then go against it.
[01:25:48.837 --> 01:25:49.938]  They just are so arrogant.
[01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:52.320]  They keep lying, lying, lying, lying, lying.
[01:25:53.223 --> 01:25:56.006]  Because you've got to remember something, Alex.
[01:25:56.427 --> 01:26:11.764]  When you are addicted to a lie, when you're addicted to the same phrases that you've lived by, remember, all of these politicians, you're talking about thousands of them all over the United States, Republicans and Democrats.
[01:26:11.784 --> 01:26:12.565]  They're in their own rut.
[01:26:12.605 --> 01:26:13.406]  They're in their own bubble.
[01:26:14.611 --> 01:26:16.053]  It's not only their own bubble.
[01:26:16.113 --> 01:26:19.297]  They're used to paying off for what they need.
[01:26:19.357 --> 01:26:21.139]  They're used to manipulation.
[01:26:21.179 --> 01:26:22.661]  They're used to cronyism.
[01:26:23.082 --> 01:26:27.467]  They're used to using all kinds of favors to get into position.
[01:26:27.547 --> 01:26:32.773]  The very nature of politics is nothing more than kind of a whoreish
[01:26:34.015 --> 01:26:40.741]  You basically sell yourself to the highest bidder to come into a process that really has no outcome.
[01:26:41.182 --> 01:26:42.263]  I learned that.
[01:26:42.323 --> 01:26:43.964]  I had so many that quit years ago.
[01:26:44.025 --> 01:26:45.306]  They come out and say, what's your price?
[01:26:45.346 --> 01:26:46.026]  The price went up and up.
[01:26:46.047 --> 01:26:47.108]  I said, the price is freedom.
[01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:48.729]  Dr. Pachinik, God bless you.
[01:26:48.749 --> 01:26:49.430]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:50.371]  StevePachinik.com.
[01:26:50.391 --> 01:26:52.032]  Have a great week coming up.
[01:26:52.813 --> 01:26:53.133]  You too.
[01:26:55.714 --> 01:26:56.535]  Man, I hope he's right.
[01:26:57.036 --> 01:27:00.800]  We've got Paul Joseph Watson coming up with Candace Owens.
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:02.802]  That's going to be an interesting two hours.
[01:27:02.982 --> 01:27:04.564]  I'm going to go work on all these big stories.
[01:27:05.165 --> 01:27:11.311]  We've got the big story I barely talked about where the hospital executive, 35 major hospital groups, Pennsylvania.
[01:27:11.892 --> 01:27:17.074]  The Maine Hospital Group, Pennsylvania, says it's all a fraud, and that nobody's died, and that they're totally empty.
[01:27:17.114 --> 01:27:18.855]  I mean, this is just smoking gun stuff.
[01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:20.755]  That's on Infowars.com.
[01:27:21.816 --> 01:27:26.517]  The Dominion's Chicom-owned Swiss bank accounts?
[01:27:26.557 --> 01:27:29.218]  I mean, holy mackerel, Toledo.
[01:27:29.879 --> 01:27:31.799]  I mean, this is just insane.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.020]  Wow.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.961]  I got a few more things to say, then Paul Watson takes over.
[01:27:35.981 --> 01:27:36.381]  Stay with us.
[01:27:37.369 --> 01:27:40.072]  Well, here's one of the latest articles at InfoWars.com.
[01:27:40.252 --> 01:27:44.357]  Did the president signal the dreaded COVID second wave as a hoax?
[01:27:45.117 --> 01:27:46.519]  Well, the bears live in the woods.
[01:27:47.881 --> 01:27:48.381]  Here it is.
[01:27:48.401 --> 01:27:50.563]  Fake election results in Nevada also.
[01:27:52.432 --> 01:28:00.037]  NetworkVegas.com reports, here's the fake Nevada parking garage hospital picture that our moron governor tweeted, proving it's all a scam.
[01:28:00.077 --> 01:28:03.899]  No patients, hold up in beds, wrapped up equipment that's never been used.
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:07.422]  They spent millions on the scam and never even saw a single patient.
[01:28:07.762 --> 01:28:08.803]  This is a fake hospital.
[01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:12.205]  He doesn't care that it's all empty behind him.
[01:28:12.505 --> 01:28:19.810]  Well, we have the major hospital executive on record in Pennsylvania.
[01:28:21.144 --> 01:28:24.985]  I mean, listen, listen, listen.
[01:28:25.545 --> 01:28:28.006]  I cannot express to you, we have a lot of big stories, they're all important.
[01:28:28.806 --> 01:28:43.389]  This story, with all the documents right here, out of the Securities and Exchange Commission, of 400 plus million dollars from the Communist Chinese, government-run groups directly to Staple Street Capital that owns Dominion directly for Dominion.
[01:28:45.578 --> 01:28:54.386]  This story on InfoWars.com is the Big Enchilada, a firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million from a Swiss bank owned by the Communist Chinese.
[01:28:55.587 --> 01:28:58.990]  Get it out, get it out, get it out, get it out, get it out.
[01:28:59.271 --> 01:29:05.356]  Text it, tweet it, Facebook it, email it, call people, print it out, call local radio, call Congress, call everyone.
[01:29:05.516 --> 01:29:06.858]  Run around like a chicken with your head cut off.
[01:29:07.638 --> 01:29:09.040]  Do what must be done.
[01:29:11.121 --> 01:29:13.603]  And let's not forget, again, Hunter Biden.
[01:29:13.704 --> 01:29:14.825]  They've confirmed this is all real.
[01:29:14.885 --> 01:29:17.167]  My dad, we're under criminal investigation.
[01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:19.529]  I meet with the head of Chinese intelligence.
[01:29:20.710 --> 01:29:21.851]  He disappeared.
[01:29:21.952 --> 01:29:23.393]  Yeah, I mean, the Chai comms are in trouble.
[01:29:25.315 --> 01:29:28.798]  And now they're putting up their champion, a cryptkeeper that can't even talk?
[01:29:29.159 --> 01:29:31.361]  Joe Biden, like, groping people?
[01:29:31.381 --> 01:29:33.243]  And they're saying he's the president?
[01:29:34.261 --> 01:29:37.142]  This is the mainstream media committing suicide in front of me.
[01:29:37.762 --> 01:29:39.422]  This is not going to go well, however it goes.
[01:29:39.943 --> 01:29:41.463]  Let's go ahead and play Hunter Biden.
[01:29:43.624 --> 01:29:58.087]  I get calls from my father to tell me that the New York Times is calling, but my old partner Eric, who literally has done me harm for I don't know how long, is the one taking the calls because my father will not stop sending the calls to Eric.
[01:29:59.288 --> 01:30:03.849]  I have another New York Times reporter calling about my representation of the
[01:30:04.662 --> 01:30:23.394]  Literally, Dr. Patrico, the spy chief of China, who started the company that my partner, who was worth $323 billion, founded, and is now missing.
[01:30:24.315 --> 01:30:27.177]  The richest man in the world is missing, who was my partner.
[01:30:28.677 --> 01:30:39.664]  He was missing since I last saw him in his $58 million apartment and signed a $4 billion deal to build the largest LNG port in the world!
[01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:47.789]  And... I am receiving calls from the Southern District of New York, from the U.S.
[01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:48.510]  Attorney himself.
[01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:54.274]  My best friend in business, Devin, has named me as a witness without telling me.
[01:30:56.715 --> 01:30:57.576]  In a criminal case,
[01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:02.715]  And my father, without telling me.
[01:31:03.115 --> 01:31:03.516]  $300 billion!
[01:31:03.536 --> 01:31:04.096]  $12 billion!
[01:31:04.456 --> 01:31:05.937]  That won't keep you out of hell, son.
[01:31:07.197 --> 01:31:10.419]  It's all just made-up, crap fiat garbage anyways.
[01:31:10.519 --> 01:31:14.161]  I mean, that's the wimps they put in power, the little crime.
[01:31:14.181 --> 01:31:17.062]  They're disappearing, people!
[01:31:19.944 --> 01:31:22.285]  I'm not funded by the shycoms or George Soros.
[01:31:23.846 --> 01:31:24.726]  I'm funded by you.
[01:31:24.966 --> 01:31:27.848]  And I'll never back down, I'll never give in, and I don't have any fear of these people.
[01:31:28.766 --> 01:31:33.129]  I only have fear of failure, and it's more of a burning drive to crush the enemy.

[01:31:46.618 --> 01:31:48.779]  We make less, but it's all kind of coming out.

[01:32:29.478 --> 01:32:30.039]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:32:33.325 --> 01:32:38.306]  And the answer to the Great Reset is the Great Renaissance, or the Great Resistance.

[01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:50.370]  But when it comes to financing an operation, money's actually gone down.
[01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:52.272]  I guess people think, well, Jones is right.
[01:32:52.292 --> 01:32:53.153]  He must have lots of support.
[01:32:53.193 --> 01:32:53.854]  No, that's not the case.
[01:32:54.255 --> 01:32:55.336]  We need financial support.

[01:33:08.914 --> 01:33:11.515]  We are live and it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[01:33:11.535 --> 01:33:14.916]  We're going to do a News Blitz in the next hour covering all the latest coronavirus lockdown news including
[01:33:28.112 --> 01:33:35.700]  The compulsory vaccine, which now if you listen to certain people within the UK government, they're saying it's not going to be compulsory.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.063]  Your life is just going to be made a living hell.
[01:33:38.423 --> 01:33:39.825]  You're not going to be able to travel.
[01:33:39.845 --> 01:33:42.948]  You're not going to be able to have a social life if you don't take it.
[01:33:43.248 --> 01:33:45.251]  But it's not compulsory.
[01:33:45.451 --> 01:33:46.312]  It's going to be fine.
[01:33:46.532 --> 01:33:47.313]  Just take the shot.
[01:33:47.693 --> 01:33:50.076]  But before we get into the news,
[01:33:50.968 --> 01:33:53.991]  I'm delighted to be welcomed by somebody who needs no introduction.
[01:33:54.472 --> 01:33:59.938]  The website for the purposes of this conversation is factcheckzook.com.
[01:34:00.499 --> 01:34:06.585]  Headline here out of Fox News, Candace Owens targets Facebook third-party fact-checkers with lawsuit.
[01:34:07.206 --> 01:34:10.630]  She says, I decided I was not going to give up and sit down.
[01:34:11.423 --> 01:34:17.229]  She is a New York Times best-selling author of the book Blackout, which has just been released recently.
[01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:19.932]  Of course, founder of the Blegzit movement as well.
[01:34:19.952 --> 01:34:21.834]  We'll talk about that later on in the show.
[01:34:22.375 --> 01:34:23.536]  Candice, welcome back!
[01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:26.959]  It's good to be back, PJW!
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.143]  First person who ever had me on his show, ever!
[01:34:31.484 --> 01:34:32.886]  It's good to see you again, Candice.
[01:34:32.926 --> 01:34:33.847]  Now, I want to get into this
[01:34:34.804 --> 01:34:39.266]  You fighting the fact checkers because this is something that's happened relatively recently.
[01:34:39.326 --> 01:34:42.807]  It's kind of flown under the radar, what with all the election news.
[01:34:43.408 --> 01:34:47.649]  You're basically saying it's time to fact check the fact checkers.
[01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:53.912]  I want to go on and talk about this development with PolitiFact having to publicly back down.
[01:34:54.631 --> 01:35:01.533]  But first, you're taking legal action against USA Today and this group called Lead Stories Fact Checker.
[01:35:01.974 --> 01:35:05.695]  Just tell us what prompted this initial lawsuit in the first place.
[01:35:06.695 --> 01:35:08.316]  Yeah, so it's a very interesting story.
[01:35:08.516 --> 01:35:16.338]  And basically, I had published an article onto my Facebook page that was written by a guy named Dr. John Lee, who writes for The Spectator.
[01:35:17.079 --> 01:35:21.000]  And it was basically him, just, you know, he's a former NHS pathologist.
[01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:29.073]  You know, very strong resume, is a doctor and can, of course, write his opinion on the COVID-19 sort of scare tactics that we see.
[01:35:29.113 --> 01:35:38.117]  And in the article, he basically just did a deep dive on how they were calculating COVID-19 deaths to expose, you know, just sort of the fraudulence behind it.
[01:35:38.597 --> 01:35:45.860]  And people were dying and they were doing post-mortem testing for this virus, which they had never done before, which of course was fluffing the numbers.
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:50.582]  And I published this onto my Facebook page and it got fact-checked and it got removed.
[01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:51.693]  I don't know.
[01:36:13.032 --> 01:36:14.914]  And as soon as I saw this, I went, this is crazy.
[01:36:14.954 --> 01:36:16.976]  And I went through the proper means.
[01:36:17.016 --> 01:36:20.719]  I contacted Facebook and said, you know, I want this removed from my account.
[01:36:20.759 --> 01:36:21.920]  What I said was not false.
[01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:27.485]  And he basically wrote an article declaring it was false because he had found another doctor that disagreed.
[01:36:27.926 --> 01:36:34.752]  So basically this was a game of my doctor is better than your doctor, but I'm Lead Stories and I work for Facebook, so I'm going to be able to censor you.
[01:36:35.148 --> 01:36:35.408]  And that's
[01:36:50.382 --> 01:36:52.443]  I'll remove it from false to kind of false.
[01:36:52.483 --> 01:36:53.923]  And I just wasn't happy with that.
[01:36:54.584 --> 01:36:56.925]  So I decided, you know what, let's put these guys through discovery.
[01:36:57.505 --> 01:36:59.666]  I said to my husband, I want to, I want to go after them.
[01:36:59.686 --> 01:37:00.326]  I want to sue them.
[01:37:00.386 --> 01:37:02.967]  And I want to expose who exactly these fact checkers are.
[01:37:04.228 --> 01:37:08.489]  And just really understand how they got these contracts, how they got this contract with Facebook.
[01:37:08.529 --> 01:37:12.411]  And Facebook immediately distanced themselves from the fact checkers.
[01:37:12.451 --> 01:37:13.712]  They wrote my lawyer back a letter.
[01:37:13.732 --> 01:37:16.793]  It was like, we have nothing to do with these third party fact checkers.
[01:37:16.853 --> 01:37:17.093]  Great.
[01:37:17.526 --> 01:37:23.412]  Okay, so if you're saying now that we can just go after the fact-checkers one by one and sue them, I'm happy to do that as well.
[01:37:23.532 --> 01:37:30.958]  So, because he didn't change the false rating, we went after USA Today for another scenario that was similar to that one, which made no sense.
[01:37:31.019 --> 01:37:32.480]  It was basically an opinion check.
[01:37:33.421 --> 01:37:39.486]  And we hired Todd McMurtry, who represented the Covington Catholic, Nick Sandeman, with some great success.
[01:37:40.027 --> 01:37:42.229]  And we are going after the fact-checkers, plain and simple.
[01:37:43.695 --> 01:37:47.257]  Now, to make it clear, you've got four million followers on Facebook.
[01:37:47.357 --> 01:37:52.239]  They demonetised your entire account after this initial fact-checked post.
[01:37:53.119 --> 01:37:55.800]  Did you get re-monetised or is it still demonetised?
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:38:07.345]  Because we have to make people understand here, according to the Washington Times report, because of your contract with Facebook, which they agreed to, you make around a million dollars a month off of your Facebook account,
[01:38:07.845 --> 01:38:10.908]  By means of this fact check it got demonetized.
[01:38:10.968 --> 01:38:15.273]  Of course we know along with that your entire account gets relegated in the algorithm.
[01:38:15.693 --> 01:38:17.956]  They're interfering with your book sales.
[01:38:17.996 --> 01:38:19.177]  You've got a new book out.
[01:38:19.577 --> 01:38:21.780]  That's again being relegated in the algorithm.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.642]  People seeing that because of this
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:30.586]  Parasitical fact-checking company which is not just trying to demean you in terms of your reputation.
[01:38:31.086 --> 01:38:39.134]  They're literally stealing content and they're stealing revenue from your Facebook account because it was demonetized as a result of this, correct?
[01:38:39.835 --> 01:38:47.502]  That's exactly right because don't forget when they issued that false rating they then direct traffic from your page to their site because they say this is why it's false.
[01:38:47.952 --> 01:38:51.693]  And usually what they put up is completely not even addressing what you initially put up.
[01:38:51.993 --> 01:38:59.555]  You know, they get around it and say something ridiculous where they go, well, this is, this is false because this doctor, this is literally what they wrote on that post.
[01:38:59.615 --> 01:39:04.557]  This doctor in Colorado disagrees with Dr. John Lee in the UK.
[01:39:04.597 --> 01:39:06.257]  Therefore, we're going to say this is false.
[01:39:06.710 --> 01:39:16.272]  And, you know, my average post, and this is without being monetized, this is with them shadowbanning me, I'll usually get three million people looking at each of my Facebook posts.
[01:39:16.292 --> 01:39:21.973]  So that directs three million people to their site where they have advertisement and they earn money.
[01:39:22.013 --> 01:39:23.933]  I mean, it's completely parasitic behavior.
[01:39:23.953 --> 01:39:27.154]  And they do this just because they decided they're the fact check gods.
[01:39:27.174 --> 01:39:29.975]  And what we really know is that they're not actually checking facts.
[01:39:30.555 --> 01:39:31.475]  They're checking against
[01:39:31.875 --> 01:39:33.816]  What they deem to be wrong-think, right?
[01:39:33.916 --> 01:39:38.477]  And wrong-think is anything that goes against the preferred leftist mainstream narrative.
[01:39:38.497 --> 01:39:43.239]  I mean, you could write something like, only women can have birth.
[01:39:44.019 --> 01:39:45.219]  Only women can give birth.
[01:39:45.419 --> 01:39:52.962]  And you can get fact-checked, and they can pull that down, and they can say, well, we found this guy, John Doe, out in Utah who disagrees and says men can give birth.
[01:39:52.982 --> 01:39:55.502]  And that's enough for them to fact-check you and demonetize your page.
[01:39:55.982 --> 01:40:00.784]  And to me, it's poignantly ridiculous, and I'm prepared to fight them because I have the platform and the means to do so.
[01:40:02.941 --> 01:40:08.489]  And again, this isn't with the background, of course, you were placed on this hate agent list by Facebook.
[01:40:08.529 --> 01:40:17.420]  I think last year that came out or even the year before, of course, I was banned entirely back in May 2019 because they called me a dangerous individual.
[01:40:18.081 --> 01:40:27.971]  Again, I'm still in the process of suing Facebook simply to get information out of them, what they hold on me, which in the UK is the law that you have to have access to that by law.
[01:40:28.312 --> 01:40:31.956]  They've delayed that for over a year, citing coronavirus most recently.
[01:40:32.456 --> 01:40:37.041]  But we also had, again, these dangerous persons being put on this list.
[01:40:37.621 --> 01:40:51.515]  Incredibly, a couple of weeks later, Facebook came out with a fatwa, which said it's unacceptable to incite violence against anyone using their platform, except if the person is on their dangerous individuals list.
[01:40:51.915 --> 01:40:56.740]  Of course, I was on that list, along with people like Laura Luma, Milo, Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones and others.
[01:40:57.592 --> 01:41:03.737]  Literally inciting people to organize and commit violence using their service by saying it was okay.
[01:41:04.198 --> 01:41:11.143]  And then you made the point earlier about, you know, you go after Facebook and they pass it off and say, oh, it's a third party.
[01:41:11.483 --> 01:41:12.765]  We have no relation to them.
[01:41:13.125 --> 01:41:14.926]  We're not responsible for their activities.
[01:41:15.487 --> 01:41:17.128]  Similar thing with Wikipedia.
[01:41:17.228 --> 01:41:22.953]  I don't know if you've found this, Candice, but you've probably been in battles with Wikipedia over the past four or five years.
[01:41:23.473 --> 01:41:24.114]  Recently,
[01:41:24.992 --> 01:41:34.937]  Some bright spark, some leftist editor at Wikipedia decided to call me a political extremist and now I'm forever defined as a political extremist.
[01:41:35.358 --> 01:41:41.961]  The source for that is of course biased far-left news outlets and Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook itself.
[01:41:42.041 --> 01:41:49.265]  So once you get defined as this hateful individual by Facebook, which of course is completely biased in its approach to all this,
[01:41:49.805 --> 01:41:52.007]  Then that suddenly becomes a neutral source.
[01:41:52.347 --> 01:41:55.450]  Then that suddenly becomes used by Wikipedia editors.
[01:41:55.830 --> 01:42:00.974]  Oh, but you can't sue Wikipedia because that's not an organization apparently.
[01:42:01.194 --> 01:42:06.539]  But then when you try and go and sue the editors, they get protected by Wikipedia if you go after them.
[01:42:06.899 --> 01:42:12.664]  So across the board, it's creating this miasma about not knowing who to go after legally, right?
[01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:14.550]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:14.630 --> 01:42:19.752]  And that's why we wanted, we actually wanted Facebook to distance themselves in a letter, which is what they did.
[01:42:20.053 --> 01:42:26.876]  We wanted them to say we had nothing to do with the fact checkers because then you're saying to the fact checkers, I mean, what is the upside of being a fact checker for Facebook?
[01:42:26.936 --> 01:42:27.256]  All right.
[01:42:27.296 --> 01:42:29.157]  I think we lost Candice there, but we're going to break now.
[01:42:29.177 --> 01:42:31.639]  We'll come right back and talk about this and more.
[01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:32.960]  Summit.News.
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:33.600]  Don't go away.
[01:42:34.651 --> 01:42:38.475]  And we are back, live, with Paul Joseph Watson, Summit.News.
[01:42:38.495 --> 01:42:41.578]  We're talking about fact-checking the fact-checkers.
[01:42:41.618 --> 01:42:49.266]  Of course, a major example of this that I personally experienced back in April 2019, before I was banned on Facebook.
[01:42:49.286 --> 01:42:51.569]  So this actually applied to Facebook at the time.
[01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:56.674]  And this mirrors what Candice experienced with her Facebook page being demonetised.
[01:42:57.310 --> 01:43:09.834]  By this fact-checking agency, Lead Stories, placing a hoax alert on their article which talked about her Facebook post, which was simply a post of a doctor speaking common sense about coronavirus.
[01:43:09.874 --> 01:43:14.895]  In my case, it was related to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire in Paris.
[01:43:15.836 --> 01:43:22.818]  There was widespread celebrations from a certain demographic, Islamists and Muslims, on Facebook
[01:43:23.553 --> 01:43:27.735]  You could go to RT's Arabic Facebook page, France 24 Arabic.
[01:43:28.075 --> 01:43:37.538]  There was a live video stream of Notre Dame Cathedral burning and you could watch in real time the gleeful responses from these Muslims and Islamists.
[01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:41.940]  And you could tell they were Muslims and Islamists because they were speaking Arabic, they had Muslim names.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:47.182]  And it was smiley face emoji, smiley face emoji, excited emoji, clapping emoji.
[01:43:47.522 --> 01:43:49.683]  That was their response in droves.
[01:43:50.223 --> 01:43:53.590]  to the ongoing fire, the burning of the Notre Dame Cathedral.
[01:43:53.970 --> 01:43:59.481]  So I put out an article about that with the screenshots from the Facebook posts and BuzzFeed
[01:44:00.313 --> 01:44:05.714]  Which is another fact checker that Facebook uses, put out a whole article claiming that this was a hoax.
[01:44:06.115 --> 01:44:10.936]  And once again, they slapped a giant hoax alert across the front of their article.
[01:44:11.276 --> 01:44:22.759]  And they claimed that we didn't know what these people were celebrating when they were responding gushingly and excitingly with these happy, smiley, excitable emoticons.
[01:44:23.299 --> 01:44:29.401]  Now, unfortunately for them, the live video of the Notre Dame Cathedral was at the top of the page.
[01:44:30.154 --> 01:44:32.315]  In the screenshots that I provided.
[01:44:32.615 --> 01:44:35.877]  But BuzzFeed said, oh, we don't know what they were responding to.
[01:44:36.177 --> 01:44:37.538]  So they had to change that.
[01:44:38.018 --> 01:44:54.826]  Now we have a similar situation here with you, Candice, because aside from your lawsuit against USA Today and this Lead Stories group, you also threatened PolitiFact with legal action over a Facebook post that they erroneously labelled false.
[01:44:54.906 --> 01:44:57.948]  What was the nature of that post and what was their response?
[01:44:59.158 --> 01:45:00.098]  You know, I had done a video.
[01:45:00.178 --> 01:45:01.599]  Obviously, I've been very vocal.
[01:45:02.059 --> 01:45:06.440]  I've been one of the people that have used my platform to talk about all the irregularities in this election cycle.
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.981]  I mean, there's no doubt in my mind, in the mind of millions of Americans and people abroad, that this election was rigged.
[01:45:12.001 --> 01:45:13.261]  The numbers just don't make sense.
[01:45:13.741 --> 01:45:21.123]  And so once we saw the media just decide on the narrative that he was, that Joe Biden was the president-elect, he legally is not the president-elect.
[01:45:21.163 --> 01:45:22.243]  You can't just say that.
[01:45:22.803 --> 01:45:25.144]  Um, and make that true because you want it to be true.
[01:45:25.184 --> 01:45:37.791]  So I did a video discussing how, you know, the media is actually duping people and brainwashing people into believing that he is the president-elect because if it turns out that he's not and Trump gets a second term, it's going to inspire a civil war.
[01:45:38.211 --> 01:45:44.515]  Obviously, when you've been brainwashed by so many media conglomerates to believe that this has already happened and the election is over.
[01:45:45.395 --> 01:45:51.756]  And they slapped a warning on that and said that this was false and that Joe Biden was the president-elect.
[01:45:51.776 --> 01:45:58.918]  Not only did they slap a warning, they wrote an entire article saying, here is how we at PolitiFact know that Joe Biden is the president-elect.
[01:45:59.338 --> 01:46:00.178]  And he's legally not.
[01:46:00.558 --> 01:46:01.478]  So it was just a no-brainer.
[01:46:01.518 --> 01:46:04.179]  This is just you guys deciding on a narrative that is not true.
[01:46:04.599 --> 01:46:05.719]  So we immediately went after them.
[01:46:05.759 --> 01:46:14.001]  And I was very keen to go after them because PolitiFact has been so poisonous in doing this and just saying, we decided this and therefore it's true.
[01:46:14.591 --> 01:46:19.393]  And I wanted to see, you know, how willing are you to stand by the fact that Joe Biden is the President-elect?
[01:46:19.754 --> 01:46:23.696]  Are you millions of dollars willing to stand by that, stand by that fact?
[01:46:23.716 --> 01:46:29.538]  Because we are going to add you to this lawsuit that we have against USA Today, that we have against Leaf Stories.
[01:46:29.578 --> 01:46:32.820]  And they immediately backed down and said it was a mistake.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.641]  Their lawyer went back and said it was a mistake.
[01:46:35.001 --> 01:46:37.683]  I mean, that's quite the mistake, right, PJW?
[01:46:38.003 --> 01:46:39.624]  Like, you wrote an entire article.
[01:46:40.764 --> 01:46:45.027]  It wasn't like, you know, you just kept making that mistake, 1,200 words, kept making a mistake.
[01:46:45.287 --> 01:46:46.067]  It wasn't a mistake.
[01:46:46.107 --> 01:46:46.888]  It was intentional.
[01:46:47.448 --> 01:46:58.594]  It was done to continually delude society into believing that this election is over and that Trump has no shot at remaining the president for the next four years.
[01:46:58.894 --> 01:47:01.836]  And this is exactly why I started factcheckzuck.com.
[01:47:02.356 --> 01:47:04.698]  Now, the PolitiFact organization is basically a unit of the Poynter Institute.
[01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:06.279]  This is this big umbrella fact-checking network.
[01:47:06.299 --> 01:47:09.542]  Interestingly enough, in 2017, the Poynter Institute, which owns PolitiFact,
[01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:39.720]  Received 1.3 million dollars from the Omidor Network and the Open Society Foundations, of course, overseen by our favourite Mr George Soros.
[01:47:40.672 --> 01:47:49.556]  And then they came out also, I recall, with this blacklist of conservative websites, which were pretty mainstream websites, the Freebeak and the Washington Times.
[01:47:49.997 --> 01:47:55.899]  They had to withdraw that because they admitted their own methodology was completely flawed.
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.181]  So these fact-checking groups are more sensitive.
[01:47:59.241 --> 01:48:01.142]  And of course, as we know, with Snopes, for example,
[01:48:01.818 --> 01:48:03.359]  They're all left-wing fronts.
[01:48:03.699 --> 01:48:11.542]  This notion that they're neutral, you know, impartial denizens of truth has been disproven time and time again, right?
[01:48:11.562 --> 01:48:12.842]  They're all left-wing fronts.
[01:48:12.902 --> 01:48:23.006]  And now, in fact, the Facebook officials that were put under so much scrutiny for killing democracy and helping Trump win, half of them are now on the Biden transition team.
[01:48:24.943 --> 01:48:25.744]  It's exactly right.
[01:48:25.764 --> 01:48:32.308]  I mean, it's just it's so ridiculous because I mean, the bigger problem here is that what we're facing is extreme censorship.
[01:48:32.768 --> 01:48:37.692]  And this is something you just would never think would happen, especially in America, where we so much believe in free speech.
[01:48:37.732 --> 01:48:40.174]  You are starting to see that they are censoring people.
[01:48:40.294 --> 01:48:40.694]  And I think
[01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:46.563]  What they did in the beginning and what people didn't speak was they said, oh, we'll just censor the people that are on the fringe.
[01:48:46.703 --> 01:48:49.203]  And conservatives got in line and said, OK, well, that's fine.
[01:48:49.243 --> 01:48:53.144]  Yeah, we're just censoring Alex Jones and Laura Loomer and Milo.
[01:48:53.184 --> 01:48:55.285]  And that's OK, because this is polite society.
[01:48:55.605 --> 01:48:59.186]  But inevitably, what always happens is that they move in and there's no sense.
[01:48:59.206 --> 01:49:00.646]  They're not going after the fringes.
[01:49:00.686 --> 01:49:02.967]  They're going after everybody that is conservative.
[01:49:03.287 --> 01:49:04.568]  This has always been their plan.
[01:49:04.608 --> 01:49:09.689]  And this is why it's important that whether or not you agree with someone or not, whether or not you think Laura Loomer
[01:49:10.169 --> 01:49:17.933]  is such an outstanding character that she should have won that congressional seat or whether you absolutely despise her, you need to speak out and defend her right to free speech.
[01:49:18.794 --> 01:49:30.900]  Because otherwise we end up in a society where now I can't publish the work of an actual doctor because it's not a preferred narrative that these leftists agree with.
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:33.802]  And they have so much power and control with this tech censorship
[01:49:34.481 --> 01:49:39.304]  It's why they're attacking a parlor right now because people are fleeing and that's a free market response.
[01:49:39.344 --> 01:49:47.969]  And so they're trying to essentially demonize parlor and make it seem like it's you know, it's being run by people who are racist and white supremacist and all of this crazy stuff.
[01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:52.672]  But you know, I know that they are fearful of this lawsuit.
[01:49:53.333 --> 01:50:02.719]  I think that they made a dangerous mistake by not just changing when we gave them the opportunity by going back and changing the rating from false and I continue to I'm
[01:50:04.005 --> 01:50:09.949]  We're planning to take this the entire way, because I do think that our freedoms actually depend on this.
[01:50:10.009 --> 01:50:16.613]  If we don't actually score a win against these big tech companies, we aren't going to have a Western society we're defending.
[01:50:16.633 --> 01:50:18.034]  We're going to be like communist China.
[01:50:19.995 --> 01:50:25.779]  Now, let's do one more segment when we come back, Candice, but we've got about 50 seconds here, so I'll introduce the next topic now.
[01:50:25.839 --> 01:50:27.780]  You talked about the vast
[01:50:28.834 --> 01:50:34.324]  Oppressive, censorious approach towards COVID, even from whistleblowers experts.
[01:50:34.384 --> 01:50:38.833]  The key fact here is the very whistleblowers who raised the alarm bill
[01:50:39.503 --> 01:50:41.365]  Alarm bell about COVID-19.
[01:50:41.465 --> 01:50:49.431]  At the very start of the pandemic were doctors and medical professionals in China saying that it was a real thing back in December.
[01:50:49.772 --> 01:50:51.493]  They received police visits.
[01:50:51.873 --> 01:50:54.415]  They were censored on Chinese social media.
[01:50:54.776 --> 01:50:57.878]  They were silenced for trying to warn about coronavirus.
[01:50:58.179 --> 01:51:06.345]  So the very first acts of censorship in terms of coronavirus were against people trying to alert the world to the fact that China was covering it up.
[01:51:06.365 --> 01:51:08.227]  We'll talk about that and more on the other side.
[01:51:08.707 --> 01:51:09.247]  And we are back.
[01:51:09.327 --> 01:51:15.330]  The website is factcheckzuck.com and Candice has got a real good chance here.
[01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:21.232]  If you listen to some of the legal experts, Robert Bonds and others, she's got a real good chance of beating these people.
[01:51:21.652 --> 01:51:31.416]  As we know, they have endless vast pots of money thanks to the fact that they're funded by groups linked to Open Society Foundations and other leftist front groups like that.
[01:51:32.179 --> 01:51:38.130]  Now you can go and support Candice at factcheckzuck.com and I invite everyone to do that right now.
[01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:40.975]  The link will be in the description when this goes up on YouTube.
[01:51:41.476 --> 01:51:43.259]  But I was talking Candice before the break
[01:51:44.224 --> 01:51:49.508]  The very whistleblowers who tried to warn the world about Covid when China was trying to cover it up.
[01:51:49.869 --> 01:52:00.357]  When the World Health Organization, by the way, said there was no human-to-human transmission, as late as the middle of January, at different times they urged people not to buy face masks.
[01:52:00.417 --> 01:52:02.299]  The World Health Organization, that is.
[01:52:02.859 --> 01:52:05.882]  Now YouTube says you can't question the World Health Organization.
[01:52:06.402 --> 01:52:07.283]  It's this idea that
[01:52:08.064 --> 01:52:21.335]  Challenging health authorities threatens public health when the very first people doing that at the start of the pandemic were the Chinese doctor whistleblowers calling the Communist Party out for covering up the pandemic.
[01:52:21.755 --> 01:52:24.277]  Surely that's the lifeblood of a free society, right?
[01:52:27.067 --> 01:52:33.411]  The COVID-19 stuff I've been talking about for a very long time because we've never seen such mass censorship over an issue.
[01:52:34.112 --> 01:52:38.454]  You would think, by the way, let's remove COVID-19 from the scenario that we're talking about.
[01:52:38.474 --> 01:52:39.435]  Let's create a new scenario.
[01:52:39.455 --> 01:52:44.918]  Let's create any health predicament anybody could possibly have, whether it's cancer, pregnancy.
[01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:45.599]  I'm pregnant right now.
[01:52:46.072 --> 01:52:49.715]  You are always allowed to hear multiple opinions from doctors, right?
[01:52:49.735 --> 01:52:54.778]  I could go to a doctor right now who would tell me that giving birth naturally is the best thing in the entire world.
[01:52:54.838 --> 01:52:57.921]  I can go see another doctor who says, you know, take the epidurals.
[01:52:58.261 --> 01:53:02.664]  In the long run, it's going to be better for your baby if you're a relaxed, you know, if you're a relaxed mom, right?
[01:53:02.844 --> 01:53:05.406]  So we've always been in a society that allows for different opinions.
[01:53:05.819 --> 01:53:19.449]  COVID-19, we have seen suddenly that you cannot question who, you cannot question the CDC, and questioning them whatsoever can lead to censorship of even doctors, right?
[01:53:19.489 --> 01:53:30.437]  Remember the YouTube videos of doctors who were going and talking about what they were seeing as they were treating patients with COVID-19, doctors that were against the lockdowns, you know, doctors that were saying,
[01:53:30.857 --> 01:53:31.258]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:53:46.661 --> 01:53:46.961]  Okay.
[01:54:01.903 --> 01:54:08.985]  This lockdown for this long, we're supposed to believe that China, as you just mentioned, we're learning now today, CNN is saying, oh, they covered some deaths.
[01:54:09.245 --> 01:54:12.686]  We're supposed to believe that China only took, what was it, a month before they reopened?
[01:54:12.706 --> 01:54:17.728]  Was it a couple of weeks before they were able to reopen their society and people were able to get back to work?
[01:54:18.668 --> 01:54:27.951]  So I have been talking about this for a very long time, and it is shameful that the media has been participating in censoring so much information
[01:54:28.593 --> 01:54:31.955]  From valid sources regarding what sort of a predicament we're actually in.
[01:54:33.656 --> 01:54:34.696]  No, you mentioned China.
[01:54:34.716 --> 01:54:35.897]  I've got an article out today.
[01:54:36.037 --> 01:54:39.959]  China to enjoy better post-COVID economy than all of the major nations.
[01:54:40.619 --> 01:54:43.701]  They're out there having pool parties in Wuhan.
[01:54:43.741 --> 01:54:46.823]  They're at the nightclubs, no masks, no social distancing.
[01:54:47.223 --> 01:54:50.565]  Their GDP this year is set for a 1.8% increase.
[01:54:50.605 --> 01:54:51.665]  The US is going to be down 3.7%.
[01:54:53.406 --> 01:55:01.832]  Meanwhile, in the US, you've got Amazon adding 427,000 employees between January and October.
[01:55:01.852 --> 01:55:05.354]  Throughout this pandemic, you've got small businesses going bust.
[01:55:05.695 --> 01:55:10.778]  They've lost on average 30% of their income over the past six months.
[01:55:11.098 --> 01:55:22.186]  So the only people benefiting out of this economically are Amazon, Walmart, Target, and all these big retailers who everyone has now become completely dependent upon, as if they weren't dependent on them enough.
[01:55:22.848 --> 01:55:38.277]  And China, which went from literally putting out videos of people convulsing and collapsing in the street back in January, which we all freaked out about, that was obviously some kind of propaganda designed to make the West overreact to the COVID pandemic.
[01:55:38.917 --> 01:55:42.099]  And now we're in this situation where we can't even talk about it.
[01:55:42.399 --> 01:55:43.680]  I want to bring it over to the back.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:47.002]  I would like to say I was the only one who never freaked out.
[01:55:47.082 --> 01:55:50.644]  It was so obviously propaganda when I saw people wiping out in the streets.
[01:55:50.704 --> 01:55:50.924]  I'm like,
[01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:52.705]  Wrong, you know, somebody passed out.
[01:55:53.026 --> 01:55:53.686]  I mean, this happens.
[01:55:53.746 --> 01:55:54.947]  I lived in, you know, New York City.
[01:55:54.987 --> 01:55:57.029]  Stuff happens on the train like this all the time.
[01:55:57.049 --> 01:56:03.395]  Now all of a sudden you have people, you know, putting together these videos and you're saying, oh, I'm like, so we're all just going to wipe out in the middle of the street.
[01:56:03.475 --> 01:56:05.677]  And it just, it always seemed a bit weird to me.
[01:56:05.757 --> 01:56:10.921]  Everything about COVID-19 just, it was one of those things where it just, a chill went up my spine.
[01:56:11.001 --> 01:56:12.262]  I was like, something's weird about this.
[01:56:12.342 --> 01:56:17.707]  It was also the timing, you know, in the midst of such a serious election in America, just a lot of it just didn't make sense.
[01:56:18.177 --> 01:56:18.517]  Absolutely.
[01:56:33.519 --> 01:56:34.340]  It's just not okay.
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:49.829]  And yet they have condoned flying on a plane next to each other, okay, where you're allowed to take off your mask, you are allowed to eat, you can drink coffee while you are on the flight because Harvard did a study and determined that somehow planes are safe and restaurants are not.
[01:56:50.189 --> 01:56:56.853]  If that does not let you know that there is a true financial incentive behind this to attack small business owners,
[01:56:57.353 --> 01:56:59.634]  And while protecting the lease and nothing will.
[01:56:59.914 --> 01:57:09.698]  And by the way, guys, every time any like funding of a study is done through Harvard, you can almost guarantee that they were there to produce the desired results to the person that funded the study.
[01:57:10.158 --> 01:57:13.459]  And that is, I think, the most despicable thing that you can point to.
[01:57:13.739 --> 01:57:16.620]  That airlines are allowed to fill their flights with people.
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:21.502]  Everybody gets sick every time you fly because it's just the air is just so disgusting on all airlines.
[01:57:22.342 --> 01:57:26.404]  And yet they are allowed to fly people and business owners cannot open their restaurants.
[01:57:27.768 --> 01:57:28.469]  No, it's ridiculous.
[01:57:28.489 --> 01:57:32.433]  We had a rule at 10pm curfew where everyone was thrown out of the bars at 10pm.
[01:57:32.733 --> 01:57:35.736]  They all congregated on the streets and just had street parties.
[01:57:36.116 --> 01:57:43.964]  Now in Wales, the government is saying pubs can't serve alcohol, as if you're more susceptible to the virus if you're drinking alcohol.
[01:57:43.984 --> 01:57:47.968]  That's going to put those pubs, those restaurants, even further into the mire.
[01:57:48.368 --> 01:57:50.010]  And then we have the vaccine, of course.
[01:57:50.859 --> 01:58:05.212]  You've had the debate in the US, but it's come to the fore more in the UK, with companies and airlines now suggesting that you won't be allowed to enter a bar, a restaurant, cinema, sports stadium or any other kind of similar venue if you don't take the vaccine.
[01:58:05.252 --> 01:58:10.437]  So we have the government saying, oh, we're not going to make it mandatory, but you're not going to be able to travel.
[01:58:11.258 --> 01:58:14.821]  Or have any kind of social life if you don't take it.
[01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:24.568]  So again, it's this kind of it's this two tier system where you have a lower cast of people who aren't going to be able to enjoy basic freedoms, mobility and social life.
[01:58:24.988 --> 01:58:26.990]  But if you take the shot, then you can.
[01:58:27.370 --> 01:58:38.118]  What kind of backlash is it going to create or need or require for these small businesses, these bars, restaurants to go against the grain and say, no, you don't have to take the vaccine to come into our premises.
[01:58:38.498 --> 01:58:40.060]  Given that we've seen polls, Candace,
[01:58:41.087 --> 01:58:48.711]  In the UK, and it's probably even greater in the US, that show 36% of people are very unlikely to take the vaccine.
[01:58:48.771 --> 01:58:56.575]  So a bars, restaurants, sports stadiums really going to take that financial hit to carry through this compulsory vaccine policy?
[01:58:56.715 --> 01:58:58.876]  Or do you see that falling by the wayside?
[01:58:59.867 --> 01:59:01.188]  I see it falling by the wayside.
[01:59:01.208 --> 01:59:04.471]  And I will say this, I have already spoken out and said I will not be taking the vaccine.
[01:59:04.491 --> 01:59:05.932]  I've been saying this since February.
[01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:06.893]  I knew this was coming.
[01:59:07.513 --> 01:59:08.414]  It makes no sense.
[01:59:08.614 --> 01:59:11.536]  There's a 99% chance that you're going to survive if you get COVID-19.
[01:59:11.876 --> 01:59:17.101]  Why the hell would you take a vaccine that has 94% effective and causes you to be sick?
[01:59:17.161 --> 01:59:18.221]  And now they're prepping people.
[01:59:18.342 --> 01:59:21.824]  Oh, well, the vaccine could make you sick, but make sure you come back and get the second dose.
[01:59:21.904 --> 01:59:22.685]  I won't be taking it.
[01:59:22.705 --> 01:59:28.890]  But I do want to say as a reminder to everybody who's watching, there's one thing that every society in the entire world
[01:59:29.210 --> 01:59:29.490]  We're good.
[01:59:45.811 --> 01:59:47.331]  You know, if we say no, it's a no.
[01:59:47.972 --> 01:59:53.153]  You know, if we decide that, okay, you say that I can't fly unless I get this vaccine, let's just not fly for a year.
[01:59:53.493 --> 01:59:56.074]  Eventually they're going to have to come to because it's going to hurt them.
[01:59:56.914 --> 02:00:01.296]  So, you know, I think every person should do their best with the information that they have available.
[02:00:01.556 --> 02:00:03.076]  The vaccine is not for Candace Owens.
[02:00:03.116 --> 02:00:06.457]  The vaccine will not be taken in my family and it won't be given to my children.
[02:00:06.817 --> 02:00:08.358]  And that's the most that I can say about that.
[02:00:09.759 --> 02:00:11.821]  Okay, Candice, that's a good place to close.
[02:00:11.881 --> 02:00:14.924]  The website is factcheckzook.com.
[02:00:15.124 --> 02:00:20.368]  We'll be sure to have you back on in the near future to see how your campaign to fight the fact checkers is going.
[02:00:20.408 --> 02:00:21.669]  Candice, thanks for joining us.
[02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:23.291]  Thanks for having me.
[02:00:24.352 --> 02:00:25.513]  There goes Candice Owens.
[02:00:25.553 --> 02:00:31.438]  And again, this interview will be up on YouTube and the descriptions, the links will be down there for everybody to access.
[02:00:32.329 --> 02:00:35.070]  We're going to come back in the next segment and dive straight into the news.
[02:00:35.110 --> 02:00:38.771]  We've got the UK deploying the military to make people accept the vaccine.
[02:00:38.791 --> 02:00:40.751]  We'll talk about that and more on the other side.
[02:00:41.272 --> 02:00:44.172]  Summit.News and we are back live on the show.
[02:00:44.192 --> 02:00:52.835]  We're going to delve into the latest news and we're going to start with an article that I mentioned earlier on during that interview, which is up on Summit.News.
[02:00:52.935 --> 02:00:57.976]  China to enjoy better post-COVID economy than all other major nations.
[02:00:58.036 --> 02:00:59.637]  We've got the GDP figures
[02:01:00.305 --> 02:01:06.369]  Not just for this year, but for 2021, at least the forecast for GDP for 2020 and 2021.
[02:01:07.449 --> 02:01:11.231]  And guess who's come out of all this smelling like roses?
[02:01:11.932 --> 02:01:14.113]  Oh, it's the Communist Chinese.
[02:01:14.173 --> 02:01:15.274]  Well, what a surprise.
[02:01:16.174 --> 02:01:20.817]  The country in which the coronavirus originated has come out better than anyone.
[02:01:21.297 --> 02:01:22.818]  They're all having pool parties.
[02:01:23.370 --> 02:01:24.950]  They're all dancing in nightclubs.
[02:01:25.551 --> 02:01:28.151]  Meanwhile, you can't hug your granny at Christmas.
[02:01:28.191 --> 02:01:33.453]  In fact, the CDC came out last week and said, you can't sing at Thanksgiving.
[02:01:34.813 --> 02:01:37.494]  I'm sure a lot of people abided by that directive.
[02:01:38.194 --> 02:01:50.738]  But now the OECD has revealed that China is set to enjoy a post-COVID economic recovery that outstrips every other major country in the world, most of which will see debilitating drops in their GDP.
[02:01:52.418 --> 02:01:53.439]  And we have a list here.
[02:01:53.479 --> 02:02:07.227]  It says a graph proposing GDP projections for various nations and areas show that China was the only nation on the list to enjoy real GDP growth in 2020, with 1.8% plus this year, as well as a prediction of 8% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022.
[02:02:16.736 --> 02:02:28.280]  In comparison, the United States, having suffered a 3% drop, 3.7% drop in 2020, is set to achieve 3.2% and 3.5% real GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 respectively.
[02:02:28.821 --> 02:02:41.045]  Bear in mind that's with the potential, God forbid, of a Biden presidency where he's called for a national mask mandate, where his advisors have called for rolling lockdowns on and off.
[02:02:42.065 --> 02:02:43.466]  So I reckon those numbers are
[02:02:44.961 --> 02:02:55.490]  A bit overall, a bit too positive given the fact that we're going to have a massive change in policy and it's going to come from the federal level with Biden encouraging all these areas to lock down even further.
[02:02:56.391 --> 02:02:58.073]  But China is going to be just fine.
[02:02:58.093 --> 02:03:06.360]  As the United Kingdom compared to most countries on the outlooks graph got affected more heavily, suffering a GDP reduction of 11.2% in 2020,
[02:03:09.508 --> 02:03:11.889]  With only Argentina suffering worse results.
[02:03:11.969 --> 02:03:24.396]  And that's, of course, because we've completely failed to follow the model of Sweden by not locking down, despite the fact that Sweden has a lower death rate, a lower infection rate, even if you compare the populations.
[02:03:25.476 --> 02:03:28.117]  And, of course, they never told their population to lock down.
[02:03:28.598 --> 02:03:31.219]  Businesses across the United Kingdom are closing down.
[02:03:31.779 --> 02:03:34.340]  You've got the cabbies on starvation wages.
[02:03:34.841 --> 02:03:37.542]  The taxis have all been mothballed.
[02:03:37.562 --> 02:03:39.103]  They're just sitting in empty fields.
[02:03:40.182 --> 02:03:42.583]  But China's going to be just fine.
[02:03:43.743 --> 02:03:45.003]  And of course, we had this article.
[02:03:45.363 --> 02:03:56.586]  Oh, by the way, this also relates to the fact that China deliberately hyped this virus to hysterical levels before it crossed over into Europe and the United States.
[02:03:56.686 --> 02:04:07.528]  As I was talking about before, there were multiple videos that emerged out of China every single day during the early stages of the pandemic, before it even reached Europe.
[02:04:08.439 --> 02:04:14.903]  Of people literally convulsing, collapsing and dying in the streets, apparently due to coronavirus infection.
[02:04:15.324 --> 02:04:28.813]  Now we know that whatever coronavirus symptoms are, you know, loss of taste, loss of smell, coughing, of course we know that the vast majority of people are either asymptomatic or recover within three or four days.
[02:04:29.614 --> 02:04:42.688]  We know that convulsing and dying in the streets like you see here is not a coronavirus symptom and yet we saw multiple videos of precisely that coming out of China day after day after day.
[02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:49.535]  And that prompted a great overreaction in the West with these different lockdown policies.
[02:04:50.197 --> 02:04:54.981]  Now, of course, you could make the argument that China was lying about their true death rate.
[02:04:55.001 --> 02:04:59.425]  I think it was 5,000 the last time I checked.
[02:04:59.445 --> 02:05:01.006]  I'm going to check again.
[02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:08.132]  But if you compare the population of China, of course, 1.3 billion compared to what, 370 million people in the United States.
[02:05:11.590 --> 02:05:18.497]  China has 4,600 coronavirus deaths compared to what is the United States up to?
[02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:20.478]  I think it's like 300,000 by this point.
[02:05:21.219 --> 02:05:26.404]  The UK is on 55,000, of course with a far lower population.
[02:05:27.785 --> 02:05:29.847]  Deaths from coronavirus in the US, 269,000.
[02:05:34.429 --> 02:05:42.992]  Again, with a 370 million population compared to not even 5,000 in China, the origin of the virus.
[02:05:43.512 --> 02:05:49.474]  Now, unless the Chinese government was lying all along about their death rate, that's definitely a possibility.
[02:05:50.154 --> 02:05:59.637]  Unless there was a mutation of the virus that caused it to become more potent, more fatal when it reached Europe and America, or
[02:06:00.367 --> 02:06:15.833]  Of course, the other fact remains the potential that authorities in the US, in the UK and across Europe counted Covid deaths as a Covid death, despite the fact that these people have several other comorbidities, which we now know for a fact.
[02:06:16.153 --> 02:06:19.694]  So all these Covid deaths could be completely wrong across the board.
[02:06:19.975 --> 02:06:28.898]  But we know for a fact, for a fact, that convulsing, vomiting and dying on the streets was not ever a symptom of coronavirus.
[02:06:29.983 --> 02:06:37.150]  But now China's completely recovered, they're all going to pool parties in Wuhan and their economy is just going to be tickety-boo.
[02:06:39.031 --> 02:06:46.318]  In a similar way to Amazon, headline, Amazon goes on lockdown hiring spree while small businesses go bust.
[02:06:46.398 --> 02:06:47.880]  Yes, the only
[02:06:49.341 --> 02:07:05.186]  Competitors in terms of the economy to come out of this even better than before are giant transnational corporations, the very same ones that fund the news networks, that push the hysteria about this virus being more deadly, being more debilitating than it is.
[02:07:05.766 --> 02:07:06.747]  They've all cashed in!
[02:07:07.747 --> 02:07:12.449]  While your small business is going bust, while people are losing their jobs left, right and centre.
[02:07:13.389 --> 02:07:16.210]  Amazon went on a record global hiring spree over the course of 2020.
[02:07:17.890 --> 02:07:38.704]  While small businesses went bust, proving that lockdown policies only benefit giant transnational corporations, they added 427,000 employees between January and October throughout the height of this pandemic, pushing their workforce to more than 1.2 million people, up more than 50% from a year ago.
[02:07:39.625 --> 02:07:43.187]  Amazon's number of workers now approaches the entire population of Dallas,
[02:07:43.976 --> 02:07:47.777]  And they're hiring an average of about 2,800 employees a day.
[02:07:48.417 --> 02:08:01.639]  Now, if you compare that historically, they've outstripped the previous record, which was Walmart two decades ago, where they added 230,000 employees in a single year.
[02:08:01.739 --> 02:08:06.820]  So Amazon's already outstripped that within 10 months times two.
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:12.041]  So they've beaten Walmart times two, not even accounting for the full year.
[02:08:13.286 --> 02:08:27.558]  And in fact, historically, that rate of hiring was only beaten during World War Two, because of the rapid increase in the shipbuilding industry, and the need for workers to fight the war during World War Two.
[02:08:28.519 --> 02:08:36.446]  So literally, in a commercial sense, it's the biggest by 100% of Walmart economic hiring growth ever seen.
[02:08:37.637 --> 02:08:48.484]  It says the scale of hiring is even larger than it may seem, because the numbers do not account for employee churn, nor do they include the 100,000 temporary workers who have been recruited for the holiday shopping season.
[02:08:49.325 --> 02:08:58.311]  They also don't include what internal documents show are as roughly 500,000 delivery drivers who are contractors and not direct Amazon employees.
[02:08:58.371 --> 02:08:59.111]  And that's key.
[02:09:00.472 --> 02:09:06.396]  Because if you recall at Schwab's, Klaus Schwab, sorry, COVID-19, the Great Reset book,
[02:09:07.037 --> 02:09:15.564]  He, of course, is the head honcho, the founder of the World Economic Forum, this global elite technocrat group that's pushed for a, quote, great reset.
[02:09:16.224 --> 02:09:29.194]  And if you read his book, he openly praises the fact that everyone will basically be technically self-employed, but they'll be completely dependent on giant transnational corporations like Amazon.
[02:09:30.575 --> 02:09:36.020]  And they'll be contractors for Amazon, so they get none of the employment benefits or protections
[02:09:36.713 --> 02:09:40.915]  But they'll get all of the downsides, and it is a race to the bottom.
[02:09:41.556 --> 02:09:50.700]  Because here in the UK, you have delivery men, delivery drivers, who have to bid on prices to deliver Amazon parcels.
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:54.903]  And of course, the company will choose whoever bids the lowest amount.
[02:09:54.963 --> 02:09:56.784]  So it's always a race to the bottom.
[02:09:57.284 --> 02:10:03.227]  They're making less and less money, and yet Amazon is hiring more and more of them at a greater rate.
[02:10:04.368 --> 02:10:04.848]  Meanwhile,
[02:10:06.949 --> 02:10:16.693]  100%.
[02:10:07.730 --> 02:10:16.693]  Amazon has seen its profits during the Covid pandemic soar by 100%, while small businesses have lost 30% in profits, and that's only going to get worse.
[02:10:17.313 --> 02:10:23.056]  And 21%, one in five plus small businesses, have closed down permanently.
[02:10:23.656 --> 02:10:31.239]  You look at the personal wealth increase accrued by the CEOs of companies like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Lowe's,
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:47.556]  Amazon it's up 91 billion, in terms of Jeff Bezos, Walmart 38 billion, Google 37 billion, Microsoft 33 billion, while small businesses collectively have lost over 200 billion.
[02:10:48.597 --> 02:10:49.999]  Now as we point out in this article,
[02:10:50.814 --> 02:11:04.185]  Amazon's Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, which has advocated lockdowns and corona hysteria from the very beginning, and that's made him and his company filthy rich, while everybody else goes bust.
[02:11:04.935 --> 02:11:05.435]  Don't go away.
[02:11:05.475 --> 02:11:07.357]  We'll be back to talk about vaccine and more.
[02:11:07.377 --> 02:11:08.257]  Summit.News.
[02:11:08.577 --> 02:11:09.118]  Welcome back.
[02:11:09.198 --> 02:11:12.200]  We are entering the fourth hour of the show.
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:26.810]  We're going to talk about the push to mandate vaccines, not via government law, but via services and companies demanding people take the vaccine before they're allowed to travel and to bars and to restaurants and to sports stadiums.
[02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:28.251]  The push is on.
[02:11:28.351 --> 02:11:33.094]  Now, to be fair, some airlines have said they've come out and said they're not going to force that for travel within Europe.
[02:11:33.624 --> 02:11:51.438]  But long-call airliners are signalling that you're going to have to have your digital certificate, your proof of vaccination, simply to be allowed not just to fly, but in other cases merely to enter different venues, even suggesting maybe even taxis and trains.
[02:11:51.478 --> 02:11:56.562]  You won't even be able to use those unless you've submitted to the shot.
[02:11:57.142 --> 02:12:00.525]  But this is a far bigger agenda than just the shot.
[02:12:01.592 --> 02:12:05.135]  Than just the economic aspects which we talked about before the break.
[02:12:05.795 --> 02:12:07.216]  Because of course we have the Great Reset.
[02:12:07.497 --> 02:12:18.765]  Now I talked with Candice about how fact-checkers work to relegate important and true statements and articles by slapping hoaxes, by slapping fact-check warnings of them.
[02:12:19.666 --> 02:12:23.969]  And of course that relegates the content within the algorithms of social media corporations.
[02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:26.691]  So we have that taking place.
[02:12:26.891 --> 02:12:35.161]  We also have this, and this is an article that I flashed back to again and again and again, because it relates to that fact-checking process.
[02:12:36.998 --> 02:12:45.500]  The New York Times last week and other organisations came out once again and they're doing this on a daily basis and telling people that the Great Reset is just a conspiracy theory.
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:49.341]  Either it doesn't exist or it does exist and it's a good thing.
[02:12:49.401 --> 02:12:53.342]  It's just if you say it's a bad thing then suddenly it does exist, doesn't exist.
[02:12:53.822 --> 02:13:04.225]  Because we had Prime Minister Justin Trudeau come out back in September and tell the world that the coronavirus pandemic was an excuse for a quote, reset.
[02:13:05.636 --> 02:13:10.642]  Reporters literally asked him about that when it re-emerged a couple of months later.
[02:13:11.302 --> 02:13:13.705]  Justin Trudeau lied, and what did he call it?
[02:13:13.725 --> 02:13:18.430]  He called it a conspiracy theory, even though those very words came out of his mouth.
[02:13:19.411 --> 02:13:23.455]  We have Klaus Schwab writing a book called COVID-19, The Great Reset.
[02:13:24.193 --> 02:13:37.445]  Literally saying that this goes way beyond medical martial law, this goes way beyond a vaccine, this goes to implantable microchips, something that we've been talking about for the past 20 years plus.
[02:13:38.726 --> 02:13:43.250]  And a quote from his book says, quote, as capabilities in this area improve,
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:47.501]  You have to imagine him saying this in a Doctor Strangelove style voice.
[02:13:48.041 --> 02:13:59.144]  The temptation for law enforcement agencies and courts to use techniques to determine the likelihood of criminal activity, assess guilt or even possibly retrieve memories directly from people's brains will increase.
[02:14:00.424 --> 02:14:00.944]  What is that?
[02:14:01.024 --> 02:14:04.205]  It's literally a minority report style pre-crime program.
[02:14:05.518 --> 02:14:10.061]  He says people will need potentially brain scans to cross borders.
[02:14:10.481 --> 02:14:17.305]  And he also makes it clear that implantable microchips will be the cornerstone of a transhumanist agenda that will merge man with machine.
[02:14:18.285 --> 02:14:26.009]  Today's external devices from wearable computers to virtual reality headsets will almost become implantable in our bodies and brains.
[02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:29.952]  So they want the implantable microchip as a result of this Covid hysteria.
[02:14:30.672 --> 02:14:34.134]  They also want you to eat weeds.
[02:14:34.949 --> 02:14:52.506]  Now we've seen over the course of the past two years, even more perhaps, this push for people in the name of preventing global warming and man-made climate change to eat bugs because they're such a great source of protein, and you're probably racist if you think that's disgusting.
[02:14:53.206 --> 02:14:57.911]  Well now headline out of moonbattery.com, let them eat weeds!
[02:14:58.701 --> 02:15:03.383]  Our globalist moonbat overlords not only want us to eat insects, they also want us to eat weeds.
[02:15:03.863 --> 02:15:09.785]  This is from our friends at the World Economic Forum, who by the way have blocked me on Twitter.
[02:15:09.805 --> 02:15:14.927]  They've blocked a bunch of other people who question their agenda because they're totally above board with it.
[02:15:15.847 --> 02:15:18.928]  It says, finding a new plant-based food is becoming increasingly urgent.
[02:15:19.728 --> 02:15:23.410]  The world population due to grow by 2 billion in the next 30 years.
[02:15:24.773 --> 02:15:39.842]  It says that, you know, bugs will be one aspect of that, but the other solution will be to eat weeds because they're easy to grow, contain nutrients, our diet needs diversity, and they say weeds taste great!
[02:15:40.894 --> 02:15:46.839]  So you're gonna have a side salad serving of weeds with your crickets, with your bugs.
[02:15:47.139 --> 02:15:49.801]  We've got that to look forward to under our new globalist overlords.
[02:15:49.841 --> 02:15:50.462]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:50.642 --> 02:15:53.824]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[02:15:54.125 --> 02:15:54.905]  Don't let them win.
[02:15:55.306 --> 02:16:00.089]  Go to our emergency election newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:03.893]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[02:16:04.233 --> 02:16:06.535]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:16:06.735 --> 02:16:09.177]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[02:16:09.622 --> 02:16:19.550]  We're live and we're talking about our future diet, which apparently not only includes bugs, but thanks to our globalist overlords at the World Economic Forum, will soon include weeds.
[02:16:20.490 --> 02:16:33.100]  Now, of course, they're not going to be eating weeds, they're not going to be eating bugs, but they're going to expect you to do so because again, this is all tied into the economic agenda, which is a lowering of living standards.
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:34.481]  We already have
[02:16:35.555 --> 02:16:43.218]  Laws being introduced in the United Kingdom that will completely ban the sale of all petrol vehicles within 10 years.
[02:16:43.758 --> 02:16:46.560]  We have these massive programs of carbon reduction.
[02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:53.342]  Zero carbon, which can only come with a massive decrease in your quality, your standard of living.
[02:16:53.703 --> 02:16:54.703]  That's been proven.
[02:16:55.123 --> 02:17:01.506]  It's been proven that the green economy doesn't even work in places like Spain, where they tried to introduce it in a major way.
[02:17:02.245 --> 02:17:07.829]  It led to 50% youth unemployment and 25% overall unemployment.
[02:17:08.670 --> 02:17:11.011]  So these ideas are completely harebrained.
[02:17:11.332 --> 02:17:12.793]  They don't work in reality.
[02:17:13.133 --> 02:17:24.501]  The elite won't be subject themselves to any of these things, but you, the pleb, the commoner, will be expected not only to limit your travel, your consumption, your quality of life,
[02:17:25.430 --> 02:17:27.693]  But you'll also be expected to change your diet.
[02:17:27.773 --> 02:17:39.268]  And yes, the World Economic Forum, the same group behind the Great Reset, which they're bragging about as such a great thing, but then if you question them about it on social media, they'll literally block you.
[02:17:39.769 --> 02:17:41.151]  That's quite the thing, isn't it?
[02:17:41.989 --> 02:17:53.220]  You don't normally get either government officials, government bodies or globalist bodies deliberately going on Twitter and blocking individuals who criticise their agenda.
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:59.066]  Kind of suggests to me that their agenda isn't really going to be that great for the little man.
[02:17:59.586 --> 02:18:00.826]  Not going to be really that great.
[02:18:01.126 --> 02:18:02.627]  And that's been born.
[02:18:02.647 --> 02:18:04.827]  That's been born to fruition.
[02:18:05.227 --> 02:18:16.430]  What we've already experienced economically with the pandemic, with the lockdown, as I mentioned before the break, massive monumental profits for Amazon, for all the CEOs, small businesses going bust.
[02:18:16.490 --> 02:18:24.711]  And yet the very people supporting those lockdown policies, which led to that economic situation, are now saying, give us more power.
[02:18:25.071 --> 02:18:26.612]  We'll redistribute the wealth.
[02:18:26.972 --> 02:18:28.432]  We'll take care of everyone.
[02:18:28.832 --> 02:18:35.194]  Oh, by the way, their idea of taking care of everyone is by literally having you on a de facto house arrest.
[02:18:35.774 --> 02:18:39.795]  You're not going to need to work a job, but then you're going to have no incentive to get up in the morning.
[02:18:39.815 --> 02:18:41.435]  You're going to be even more miserable.
[02:18:41.715 --> 02:18:45.796]  You're going to hate yourself because you're not going to have any self autonomy whatsoever.
[02:18:46.996 --> 02:18:51.917]  But the one saving grace is that you will have a diet of weeds and bugs.
[02:18:52.278 --> 02:18:55.058]  They're literally telling us we're going to start eating weeds.
[02:18:55.478 --> 02:18:58.139]  This is from the World Economic Forum website.
[02:18:59.774 --> 02:19:01.195]  Weforum.org.
[02:19:01.876 --> 02:19:05.479]  Weeds, good food, control climate change.
[02:19:05.519 --> 02:19:08.902]  That's the URL and there's a breakdown of this on moonbattery.com.
[02:19:09.682 --> 02:19:21.091]  It says, while farming animals for meat generates 14.5% of total global greenhouse emissions, weeds capture carbon from the atmosphere and can therefore help to control climate change.
[02:19:21.592 --> 02:19:23.954]  Now I don't know about you, I've never eaten weeds.
[02:19:24.154 --> 02:19:28.998]  I can't imagine they're that tasty, but apparently this is what we're going to have to do for Mother Earth.
[02:19:30.214 --> 02:19:38.028]  The elite in their ivory towers will still be dining on fillet steak, but you'll be eating grasshoppers and plants.
[02:19:38.429 --> 02:19:41.434]  Invasive species, many of them, but I'm sure they taste delicious.
[02:19:42.788 --> 02:19:52.292]  Dave Blount comments on this, he says, eating a normal human diet makes it to be too warm out according to progressive doctrine, so we must find alternatives.
[02:19:52.912 --> 02:19:58.534]  They list, they go on to list the advantages of eating weeds, including that they taste great.
[02:19:59.014 --> 02:20:00.835]  Big doubt, big doubt on that.
[02:20:01.415 --> 02:20:03.979]  Says another benefit is the low price of weeds.
[02:20:04.099 --> 02:20:05.300]  Many can be had for free.
[02:20:05.761 --> 02:20:18.037]  The next time a panhandler approaches your car at a stoplight, point to the tasty and nutritious weeds sprouting up through the cracks in the pavement that people have probably been peeing on, no doubt, and tell him, bon appétit!
[02:20:19.122 --> 02:20:27.044]  Most details of life after the Great Reset remain a mystery, but at least we have a good idea what will be on the menu for those of us who don't hobnob at Davos.
[02:20:27.484 --> 02:20:28.825]  Bugs and weeds.
[02:20:29.385 --> 02:20:35.387]  Now, there's all these hippies out there who claim, oh no, actually, you're being a little bit bigoted and a little bit closed-minded.
[02:20:35.947 --> 02:20:38.067]  Bugs actually do taste... No, they don't.
[02:20:38.247 --> 02:20:38.707]  No, they don't.
[02:20:39.088 --> 02:20:43.909]  You see travel videos all across YouTube of people trying bugs
[02:20:44.708 --> 02:20:52.915]  at Malaysian or Vietnamese markets, just for the, you know, the open-minded travel experience of sampling new cultures.
[02:20:53.616 --> 02:20:57.840]  Even the people living in those countries, they ask them, do you eat these bugs?
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:20:58.881]  No, they don't eat the bugs.
[02:20:58.901 --> 02:20:59.861]  They're disgusting!
[02:20:59.881 --> 02:21:06.727]  I know people eat some weird things in the world and sometimes those weird things don't actually taste too bad.
[02:21:07.268 --> 02:21:09.090]  Bugs aren't in that category.
[02:21:09.810 --> 02:21:11.692]  You watch any travel YouTuber,
[02:21:12.313 --> 02:21:26.607]  There's one bug stand in the market, not very popular from what I've seen, even with the local population, many of whom can't afford to eat beef on a regular basis, not very popular.
[02:21:26.727 --> 02:21:27.948]  I mean, look at the sight of it.
[02:21:27.988 --> 02:21:28.409]  Just look.
[02:21:28.909 --> 02:21:31.532]  How can that not cause you to just naturally convulse?
[02:21:32.475 --> 02:21:35.856]  But that's what the World Economic Forum wants you to eat.
[02:21:36.196 --> 02:21:39.277]  And they've been introducing this idea for many, many years.
[02:21:39.857 --> 02:21:42.198]  In fact, there's an article here which I wrote last year.
[02:21:43.539 --> 02:21:46.540]  Texas Art Museum encourages children to eat bugs.
[02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:55.023]  An art museum in Texas encouraged children and families to eat insects, including crickets and mealworms, during its Eat a Bug Day this past weekend.
[02:21:55.823 --> 02:21:58.964]  We had another one, and I think I included this in a video,
[02:22:00.194 --> 02:22:03.879]  Bugs are also a fetish, a sexual fetish for weirdos.
[02:22:04.419 --> 02:22:09.005]  Vice showcases fetish of people who incorporate bugs into their sex lives.
[02:22:09.666 --> 02:22:12.530]  We had that wondrous presentation last year.
[02:22:13.681 --> 02:22:15.482]  So this is our collective future.
[02:22:15.622 --> 02:22:25.988]  Mealworms, crickets, weeds, while Klaus Schwab and his technocrat elitist friends continue to dine on fine fillet steak in their ivory towers.
[02:22:26.228 --> 02:22:36.574]  But they really care about us and they're going to reset the economy even though what they've already done in this 10 months since Covid has put tons of people out of business.
[02:22:37.301 --> 02:22:43.425]  They're losing their jobs, small businesses going bust, Amazon record profits, Walmart record profits, Target record profits.
[02:22:44.046 --> 02:22:45.427]  But just give them more power.
[02:22:45.867 --> 02:22:46.768]  You can trust them.
[02:22:47.428 --> 02:22:55.794]  Meanwhile, the people protesting against that agenda continue to be arrested in massive numbers across the world.
[02:22:55.814 --> 02:23:00.878]  A couple of weeks ago, we had big protests in Denmark that was successful in that they
[02:23:01.778 --> 02:23:08.482]  Pressured the government into stripping out a bill which would have mandated vaccines for certain groups of people.
[02:23:09.422 --> 02:23:10.403]  That was a white pill.
[02:23:10.423 --> 02:23:12.544]  They were out on the streets protesting against that.
[02:23:12.964 --> 02:23:16.266]  Similar scenes in Germany where they got out the water cannons.
[02:23:16.406 --> 02:23:18.887]  Massive opposition to lockdown in Germany.
[02:23:19.527 --> 02:23:21.468]  And we see it building in the UK.
[02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:28.392]  Of course we had warnings from police chiefs saying that this could eventually lead to wider civil unrest.
[02:23:29.167 --> 02:23:32.008]  We had a protest, another protest in London on the weekend.
[02:23:32.788 --> 02:23:38.029]  BBC News headline, Covid, more than 150 arrests at London anti-lockdown protest.
[02:23:38.889 --> 02:23:43.811]  There's more than 150 people have been arrested during anti-lockdown protests in London's West End.
[02:23:44.611 --> 02:23:49.472]  The group Save Our Rights UK said it held the protest on Marble Arch on Saturday afternoon.
[02:23:50.192 --> 02:23:53.673]  Metropolitan Police said it had been a challenging day for its officers.
[02:23:53.693 --> 02:23:57.274]  Yeah, somewhat different from how they responded to
[02:23:58.391 --> 02:24:11.343]  Much larger Black Lives Matter protests in June, where the individuals who took part in that were literally violently attacking police officers, vandalising statues, trying to drag down statues.
[02:24:12.344 --> 02:24:14.646]  And what was the response from the Metropolitan Police?
[02:24:15.106 --> 02:24:17.148]  They bowed down and they worshipped.
[02:24:17.769 --> 02:24:19.891]  This group, which I imagine was probably about
[02:24:21.365 --> 02:24:24.328]  1,500 people, maybe a little more.
[02:24:24.468 --> 02:24:25.949]  150 of them were arrested.
[02:24:26.009 --> 02:24:29.652]  They literally arrested about 10% of the people who showed up.
[02:24:30.192 --> 02:24:35.777]  How many arrests were there during the months and months of Black Lives Matter protests in London?
[02:24:36.137 --> 02:24:38.559]  Basically a handful on each occasion.
[02:24:39.359 --> 02:24:41.301]  But again, they want to make examples of people.
[02:24:41.341 --> 02:24:41.961]  They want to see.
[02:24:41.981 --> 02:24:43.583]  They want other people to see.
[02:24:44.003 --> 02:24:45.124]  This is what happens
[02:24:46.030 --> 02:24:48.832]  when you defy our COVID restrictions.
[02:24:48.873 --> 02:24:53.897]  And this is may what may be what happens if you defy taking the vaccine.
[02:24:54.637 --> 02:24:59.161]  Meanwhile, Elvis impersonator's solo house party crashed by cops.
[02:25:00.142 --> 02:25:01.884]  This is a video that came out on Friday.
[02:25:02.704 --> 02:25:07.829]  Basically, a guy was live streaming his Elvis impersonation on the internet.
[02:25:08.449 --> 02:25:13.634]  There's a video in this article, he had his back turned to the entrance of his living room.
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:18.586]  And about 10 seconds into the clip, four police officers burst in.
[02:25:19.007 --> 02:25:20.329]  He thinks they're intruders.
[02:25:20.369 --> 02:25:26.839]  He goes and tries to attack them because they've rushed into his home that fools rushed in, pun intended.
[02:25:27.739 --> 02:25:34.425]  Again, because he was making noise and they suspected he was having a house party in violation of COVID rules.
[02:25:34.866 --> 02:25:41.472]  So with no warrant whatsoever, they just burst into his house, could have ended up in a more violent confrontation.
[02:25:41.912 --> 02:25:43.113]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[02:25:43.373 --> 02:25:48.238]  It was one guy on his own doing an Elvis impersonation on the internet.
[02:25:48.818 --> 02:25:49.679]  This is our world.
[02:25:49.699 --> 02:25:50.720]  This is life right now.
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:59.668]  Now we have increased discussion in the United Kingdom and also in the United States about this vaccine which is set to come to market in a month or two.
[02:25:59.748 --> 02:26:03.371]  Obviously the vulnerable individuals are going to be offered it first.
[02:26:04.272 --> 02:26:11.538]  Then everybody else is going to be offered it and then maybe corporation service providers are going to step in and say well if you don't take it
[02:26:12.256 --> 02:26:13.638]  You're not coming in.
[02:26:13.658 --> 02:26:24.212]  That's going to be a problem in the UK because 30%, 36% of people in a recent poll said they were extremely or very unlikely to take this vaccine.
[02:26:24.832 --> 02:26:28.858]  Are these restaurants, these bars, these sports venues, these cinemas,
[02:26:29.438 --> 02:26:42.549]  Really going to potentially sacrifice 36% of their customer base by mandating digital proof of a coronavirus vaccine before allowing people to enter their premises.
[02:26:43.310 --> 02:26:48.774]  Well, that's certainly what Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi in the UK expects.
[02:26:49.435 --> 02:26:52.778]  And in fact, we've got a clip of this, which we're going to play here in a second.
[02:26:54.204 --> 02:27:00.225]  Headline vaccine minister says bars, restaurants and cinemas will demand proof of vaccination before entry.
[02:27:01.485 --> 02:27:11.967]  This is UK vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi who says he expects all those venues to demand proof of vaccination against Covid-19 before allowing customers to enter their venues.
[02:27:12.768 --> 02:27:19.569]  This was an interview on BBC Radio's The World at One and we have a clip of that and we're going to play that right now.
[02:27:19.689 --> 02:27:20.109]  Here it is.
[02:27:20.856 --> 02:27:35.102]  Okay, but presumably it will be the case that if you have a vaccine, you will then have some form of immunity passport, and we know that Baroness Harding, who's running Test and Trace, is looking at this idea of even having it in the app, the proof of your vaccine status.
[02:27:36.383 --> 02:27:41.145]  That is presumably going to limit what some people do, if you want to go to a football game, for example, or if you want to get on a flight.
[02:27:41.685 --> 02:27:49.310]  We are looking at the technology and, of course, a way of people being able to inform their GP that they've been vaccinated.
[02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:58.976]  But also, I think you'll probably find restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, sports venues, will probably also use that system, as they've done with the app.
[02:27:59.136 --> 02:28:10.863]  The reason I think partly the app's been so successful, I think we're touching just under 19 million downloads of the app, is because a lot of places that you would go to that have got the QR code from the NHS,
[02:28:11.663 --> 02:28:13.384]  You scan for your own safety.
[02:28:13.784 --> 02:28:29.551]  And so I think in many ways the sort of the pressure will come from both ways from service providers who will say look you know demonstrate to us that you've been vaccinated but also we will make the technology as easy and as accessible as possible.
[02:28:29.731 --> 02:28:33.193]  Okay so it'll become virtually impossible to do anything if you don't have the vaccine?
[02:28:33.673 --> 02:28:41.746]  I think people have to make a decision but I think you'll probably find many service providers will want to engage in this in the way they did with the app.
[02:28:43.549 --> 02:28:48.236]  So what is that other than people basically being under permanent lockdown?
[02:28:48.869 --> 02:29:02.154]  One of the main drawbacks of lockdown, of course, is that the bars, the restaurants, the cinemas, the sports venues, the entertainment arenas, the music concerts are all closed, cutting off social life for millions and millions of people.
[02:29:02.194 --> 02:29:15.019]  Now, if you don't take the vaccine and they don't allow you in because you haven't got digital proof of having had the injection, what is that other than a form of permanent lockdown for everyone?
[02:29:15.039 --> 02:29:16.620]  36% of Brits say they're not going to take it.
[02:29:17.233 --> 02:29:26.723]  Are those industries really going to sacrifice another 36% of their customer base, given that their profits are already in the toilet, to mandate this vaccine?
[02:29:26.763 --> 02:29:28.926]  That's going to be an interesting question going forward.
[02:29:29.306 --> 02:29:32.550]  But when you've got the UK vaccine minister saying that,
[02:29:33.090 --> 02:29:34.492]  This goes straight to the point.
[02:29:34.792 --> 02:29:38.095]  They don't have to make it compulsory by law.
[02:29:38.135 --> 02:29:42.819]  They just get service providers, corporations, businesses, companies to enforce it.
[02:29:43.299 --> 02:29:52.488]  Of course, you had the head honcho over the NHS trace and test and trace program, which they introduced a few months ago here in the UK.
[02:29:53.088 --> 02:29:57.192]  Basically, whenever you go into a bar or restaurant, when they're allowed to be open,
[02:29:58.066 --> 02:29:59.927]  You have to sign a form.
[02:30:00.047 --> 02:30:02.789]  If you don't have the app, you have to give your name and address.
[02:30:03.250 --> 02:30:04.370]  Then you're in the system.
[02:30:04.691 --> 02:30:14.037]  Then if anybody in the immediate vicinity reports having caught coronavirus, you get contacted by the NHS and then you're expected to self-isolate for two weeks.
[02:30:14.437 --> 02:30:16.499]  If you don't do so, you get a fine.
[02:30:16.539 --> 02:30:19.381]  If you continue to refuse, you get a bigger and bigger fine.
[02:30:19.901 --> 02:30:21.222]  The head of that program,
[02:30:22.134 --> 02:30:29.457]  Admitted that that was the foundational basis for the future recording of whether people have had the vaccine or not.
[02:30:30.338 --> 02:30:41.363]  She said the NHS app, this is Baroness Harding, she said the NHS app will be used to quote record as a citizen your test results and whether you've been vaccinated.
[02:30:41.783 --> 02:30:50.707]  So you have the head of the test and trace program saying that, you have the UK vaccine minister saying that, this newly created position,
[02:30:51.570 --> 02:30:55.313]  But then you have this out of Michael Gove, another cabinet minister headline.
[02:30:56.494 --> 02:31:01.218]  Gove claims government not considering vaccine passports to enter venues.
[02:31:01.819 --> 02:31:15.030]  Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove contradicted his own government's vaccine minister by asserting there was no plan to issue vaccination passports that would be required before people are allowed to enter bars, restaurants and other venues.
[02:31:15.808 --> 02:31:20.910]  By the way, if you go to a bar on a Saturday night in London, there's no way they're enforcing this program.
[02:31:21.010 --> 02:31:22.110]  It's complete bedlam.
[02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:25.491]  So on a practical level, it's not even going to work in the first place.
[02:31:26.091 --> 02:31:34.054]  But Gove is coming out and contradicting other people within his own government and saying that this won't be mandated by government.
[02:31:34.414 --> 02:31:35.994]  But then again, will that matter?
[02:31:36.354 --> 02:31:39.475]  Because the companies can just go ahead and mandate it anyway.
[02:31:40.056 --> 02:31:44.217]  We had the CEO of Qantas Airlines out of Australia come out last week
[02:31:45.077 --> 02:31:47.978]  And say, basically, no vaccination, no flight.
[02:31:48.539 --> 02:32:01.884]  Now, on the flip side, we had Ryanair, which is a European airline in the European Union, which operates between countries in Europe, saying they're not going to mandate mandatory vaccines to fly because of people.
[02:32:02.044 --> 02:32:03.705]  Of course, Europe has open borders.
[02:32:03.745 --> 02:32:06.386]  Basically, you can just drive between all the different countries.
[02:32:06.826 --> 02:32:08.347]  So there's really no point whatsoever.
[02:32:09.272 --> 02:32:16.054]  So mixed messages across the board, whether this is going to be mandatory in terms of how it's enforced by companies or not.
[02:32:17.335 --> 02:32:26.858]  But as regards to the propaganda behind the vaccine itself, we have this headline, UK deploys military info war unit against COVID vaccine sceptics.
[02:32:28.039 --> 02:32:37.442]  The British government has mobilized an elite information warfare unit to combat anti-vaccine militants and interrupt their propaganda content.
[02:32:38.263 --> 02:32:47.929]  Which, of course, is going to percolate down and be represented with anyone on social media being censored, being banned for questioning not just the safety of this vaccine.
[02:32:47.969 --> 02:32:48.790]  And again, that's the point.
[02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:50.451]  I don't care if it's safe.
[02:32:50.931 --> 02:32:57.496]  If you set the precedent where governments or corporations can demand you had somebody stick a needle in your arm,
[02:32:57.996 --> 02:33:02.878]  Before you're allowed any freedom of mobility, that has to be the red line.
[02:33:02.918 --> 02:33:06.059]  If you let them get away with that, what are they going to get away with next?
[02:33:06.419 --> 02:33:10.520]  It's not even about the efficacy, the safety of the vaccine.
[02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:14.741]  It's about the complete imposition on our freedom of mobility.
[02:33:15.001 --> 02:33:21.443]  It's about basically being under de facto lockdown forever if you're one of the refuseniks who doesn't take it.
[02:33:22.443 --> 02:33:23.524]  The report says the unit
[02:33:24.844 --> 02:33:29.147]  is usually used to assist with operations against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
[02:33:30.128 --> 02:33:45.760]  So they're literally using propaganda units, normally used to fight terrorists, to fight people who question either the safety or the sanity of handing governments the power to mandate vaccines.
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:50.764]  It will be turned on those who dare question the sanctity of Covid vaccination,
[02:33:52.170 --> 02:34:01.236]  The report notes the outfit, known as the Defense Cultural Specialist Unit, was formed in Afghanistan in 2010 and is part of the Army's 77th Brigade.
[02:34:01.676 --> 02:34:09.781]  So they're literally using military psychological operations units out of the Army, not to fight terrorists.
[02:34:09.841 --> 02:34:13.423]  And we're going to have a bigger problem with terrorists, by the way, as I'm going to get into after the break.
[02:34:14.597 --> 02:34:21.564]  Probably because of Biden's foreign policy not to fight terrorists but to fight people who question the Covid vaccine.
[02:34:21.784 --> 02:34:23.086]  Summit.News will be back.
[02:34:23.126 --> 02:34:23.887]  Don't go away.
[02:34:23.927 --> 02:34:25.148]  You can't have Thanksgiving.
[02:34:25.468 --> 02:34:36.700]  We are back and we're gonna go now to a YouTube video that I put up on Friday regarding the absolute horror that awaits America if Joe Biden is allowed into the Oval Office.
[02:34:37.569 --> 02:34:51.418]  If you thought the foreign policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton was bad in terms of invading Libya, in terms of invading jihadists in Syria, was a negative impact on the world in regard to the rise of ISIS, terrorism,
[02:34:52.239 --> 02:34:59.982]  and the future of America in terms of this interventionist foreign policy hellscape, then it's only going to get worse.
[02:35:00.002 --> 02:35:03.643]  Then we're going to come back and talk about the latest with regard to election fraud.
[02:35:04.083 --> 02:35:10.365]  Now that Attorney General Barr has come out and said basically there's no evidence of election fraud, we're going to come back and talk about that.
[02:35:10.645 --> 02:35:13.586]  But for the rest of this segment, here is the video.
[02:35:13.686 --> 02:35:15.807]  It's called Meet the New Boss.
[02:35:15.887 --> 02:35:16.447]  Let's roll it.
[02:35:21.745 --> 02:35:24.806]  Enjoyed the last four years of relative peace in the Middle East?
[02:35:24.887 --> 02:35:28.068]  Felt safer after ISIS was bombed into near oblivion?
[02:35:28.108 --> 02:35:31.469]  Thankful that your tax dollars aren't funding arms for jihadists?
[02:35:31.529 --> 02:35:36.051]  Well, get ready to dispense with all that because the neoliberal war machine is back!
[02:35:36.312 --> 02:35:41.934]  Remember that weird couple of days back in 2017 when Trump ordered the bombing of the Syrian airfield?
[02:35:42.074 --> 02:35:48.515]  It was the one single time over the past four years that the mainstream media praised something he did.
[02:35:48.695 --> 02:35:54.876]  MSNBC's Brian Williams called the missiles beautiful three times in the space of 30 seconds.
[02:35:54.996 --> 02:36:03.158]  We see these beautiful pictures at night from the decks of these two US Navy vessels in the eastern Mediterranean.
[02:36:03.218 --> 02:36:08.199]  I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons and they are beautiful pictures.
[02:36:08.459 --> 02:36:10.001]  Joe Biden, America is back!
[02:36:25.996 --> 02:36:27.156]  Syrian children right now.
[02:36:27.216 --> 02:36:33.238]  Biden has tapped this guy, Antony Blinken, as Secretary of State to head up foreign policy.
[02:36:33.298 --> 02:36:37.039]  And he was immediately lavished with praise by the mainstream media.
[02:36:37.079 --> 02:36:46.662]  The Guardian gushed, calling him a born internationalist who will utilise his urbane bilingual charm to soothe the frayed nerves of Western allies.
[02:36:46.762 --> 02:36:55.085]  They marvelled at his previous appearance on Sesame Street, where he regaled Rover about the wondrous benefits and desperate hardships of refugees.
[02:36:55.245 --> 02:36:56.766]  I'm talking about refugees.
[02:36:57.227 --> 02:37:02.291]  These are people who've had to leave their homes because life in their countries was not safe for them.
[02:37:02.371 --> 02:37:04.513]  And why was that, Mr. Blinken?
[02:37:04.553 --> 02:37:11.619]  Do you think it had anything to do with the Obama administration, which you were a part of, toppling secular leaders like Gaddafi?
[02:37:11.639 --> 02:37:19.505]  Do you think it had anything to do with the Obama administration, which you were a part of, arming jihadist groups in Syria in an attempt to topple Assad?
[02:37:19.565 --> 02:37:22.388]  The administration's policies that you helped craft
[02:37:22.748 --> 02:37:28.369]  created the power vacuum that was filled by ISIS, which in turn caused the international migrant crisis.
[02:37:28.409 --> 02:37:34.551]  You vehemently supported the calamitous foreign policy that created all these refugees in the first place.
[02:37:34.611 --> 02:37:38.852]  Remember Gaddafi's warning that the Mediterranean would become a sea of chaos?
[02:37:39.012 --> 02:37:44.733]  Well, that's precisely what happened because of people in the Obama State Department like Tony Blinken.
[02:37:44.793 --> 02:37:47.914]  Oh, but Mr. Blinken really cares about the refugees!
[02:37:47.954 --> 02:37:52.335]  His administration made them refugees by f***ing over their countries.
[02:37:52.455 --> 02:37:56.639]  Well, Grover, sadly, refugees have to leave everything behind.
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:02.084]  Communities, schools, friends, even all of their favorite things.
[02:38:02.404 --> 02:38:03.726]  Mmm, don't know about that.
[02:38:03.786 --> 02:38:05.707]  Some of them appear to be doing just fine.
[02:38:15.546 --> 02:38:21.394]  Even the UN admitted that 70% of them weren't even refugees, they were economic migrants.
[02:38:21.474 --> 02:38:25.539]  Even though they come from many different places, they're just like you and me.
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:25.900]  Yeah.
[02:38:26.681 --> 02:38:28.122]  That's not strictly true, is it?
[02:38:28.142 --> 02:38:31.704]  You see, Tony here has failed to mention one crucial detail.
[02:38:31.744 --> 02:38:47.753]  The Obama administration's proxy support for jihadist thugs in Libya and Syria, which led directly to the rise of ISIS, which led directly to the migrant crisis, also led to ISIS exploiting the refugee wave to smuggle terrorists into Europe who went on to commit mass casualty atrocities.
[02:38:48.033 --> 02:38:49.293]  Oh, don't take my word for it.
[02:38:49.493 --> 02:38:53.074]  ISIS bragged about how they did this in their own propaganda magazine.
[02:38:53.134 --> 02:38:59.236]  The Manchester Arena bomber was a refugee rescued by the Royal Navy from Libya in 2014.
[02:38:59.576 --> 02:39:04.997]  The Paris Massacre terrorists hid themselves amongst the refugee wave to enter Europe.
[02:39:05.137 --> 02:39:08.258]  One of them was even carrying a fake Syrian passport.
[02:39:08.418 --> 02:39:11.819]  Several of the Brussels terrorists who helped plan the Paris Massacre
[02:39:12.219 --> 02:39:17.241]  Also re-entered Europe on the refugee wave having fought for ISIS in Syria.
[02:39:17.281 --> 02:39:22.063]  The Berlin truck terrorist, Anis Amri, arrived in Europe on a refugee boat.
[02:39:22.203 --> 02:39:25.924]  The terrorist who stabbed three people in Reading was a Libyan refugee.
[02:39:25.964 --> 02:39:29.265]  The terrorist who beheaded the French school teacher was a refugee.
[02:39:29.325 --> 02:39:32.867]  The terrorist who beheaded a woman and killed two others near a church in Nice...
[02:39:33.447 --> 02:39:34.407]  Was a refugee.
[02:39:34.467 --> 02:39:43.790]  A Heritage Foundation study found that more than a thousand people had been murdered or injured on European soil between 2014 and 2018 by asylum seekers or refugees.
[02:39:43.890 --> 02:39:45.630]  Starting to notice a pattern here.
[02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:47.311]  They're just like you and me.
[02:39:47.431 --> 02:39:50.271]  And no, obviously I'm not saying that all refugees are terrorists.
[02:39:50.331 --> 02:39:53.512]  Many of them are trying to escape terrorism in their own countries.
[02:39:53.652 --> 02:39:59.634]  I'm saying interventionist foreign policy creates a vacuum which is filled by violent Islamists.
[02:39:59.994 --> 02:40:00.594]  That's right.
[02:40:22.742 --> 02:40:29.105]  While ISIS was smuggling terror cells into Europe, Obama was dropping leaflets on ISIS in Syria.
[02:40:29.145 --> 02:40:35.607]  While jihadists were radicalised across the continent to commit mass atrocities in Paris, Nice, Brussels and Berlin.
[02:40:35.727 --> 02:40:39.909]  Obama was afraid to even utter the words Islamic terrorism.
[02:40:39.969 --> 02:40:49.653]  Whereas Islamic terrorism in the West noticeably declined after Trump began eliminating ISIS rather than arming them, under Biden and Blinken it's set for a revival.
[02:40:49.813 --> 02:40:53.554]  Radical Islamists across the world must be licking their lips with glee.
[02:40:53.674 --> 02:41:00.697]  Blinken is a dyed-in-the-wool globalist, a Council on Foreign Relations member who once described Brexit as a total mess.
[02:41:00.817 --> 02:41:04.138]  And he's never come across a foreign intervention he didn't like.
[02:41:04.358 --> 02:41:14.922]  Not only did he enthusiastically support US-NATO regime change in Libya, according to the Washington Post, Blinken was, quote, one of the government's key players in drafting Syria policy.
[02:41:14.962 --> 02:41:19.243]  He repeatedly justified arming Syrian rebels on national news networks.
[02:41:19.363 --> 02:41:20.104]  You want more?
[02:41:20.284 --> 02:41:22.846]  Blinken supported Israel's bombing of Gaza in 2014.
[02:41:23.426 --> 02:41:26.649]  Blinken supported Saudi Arabia's barbarous bombing of Yemen in 2015.
[02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:31.413]  He was Obama's point man for providing weaponry to the Saudis.
[02:41:31.453 --> 02:41:36.096]  The UN went on to declare Yemen the world's worst humanitarian disaster.
[02:41:36.117 --> 02:41:38.558]  100,000 people dead.
[02:41:38.679 --> 02:41:39.119]  That's right.
[02:41:39.259 --> 02:41:40.060]  Thanks Tony.
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:41.441]  And then of course the biggie.
[02:41:41.781 --> 02:41:52.086]  The notoriously successful 2003 US invasion of Iraq, which toppled another secular leader while bolstering Al-Qaeda and LIFG terrorist groups in the region.
[02:41:52.126 --> 02:42:03.551]  As well as killing hundreds of thousands of people in the process, including 5,000 US troops, maiming another 30,000 and leaving half a million with life-debilitating PTSD.
[02:42:03.631 --> 02:42:03.851]  Yeah.
[02:42:03.991 --> 02:42:05.632]  Guess who vehemently supported that?
[02:42:05.712 --> 02:42:06.132]  That's right.
[02:42:06.292 --> 02:42:14.536]  In fact, Blinken's role in overseeing the pivotal two-day Senate hearing in the summer of 2002 directly greased the skids for the invasion of Iraq.
[02:42:14.636 --> 02:42:17.978]  This guy's bloodlust for war puts Genghis Khan to shame.
[02:42:18.078 --> 02:42:23.520]  And unless Trump turns it round in just two months' time, he's in charge of US foreign policy.
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:28.623]  Listen, when someone's geopolitical agenda gets Hillary Clinton's seal of approval, watch out.
[02:42:28.863 --> 02:42:31.384]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:42:33.032 --> 02:42:40.555]  You'll also be shocked to learn that Blinken despises whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange and wants them both extradited.
[02:42:40.675 --> 02:42:45.537]  Oh yeah, and you remember those two other glorious components of pre-Trump American foreign policy?
[02:42:45.597 --> 02:42:47.258]  Drone strikes and torture?
[02:42:47.318 --> 02:42:50.239]  Well under Biden, that's making a comeback too!
[02:42:50.399 --> 02:43:01.484]  Avril Haines, Biden's pick for Director of National Intelligence, provided legal cover for and worked closely with Obama and Brennan on Obama's tenfold expansion of drone strikes.
[02:43:01.664 --> 02:43:08.991]  An expansion that she enthusiastically drove home despite the fact that 90% of the victims of drone strikes were innocent civilians.
[02:43:09.131 --> 02:43:15.798]  Oh, but according to this simp and countless others on Twitter, she's the nicest human alive!
[02:43:15.938 --> 02:43:24.186]  Just a hunch, but if your entire family's just been wiped out by an MQ-1 Predator during a wedding ceremony, those probably aren't the words I'd choose.
[02:43:24.286 --> 02:43:31.895]  Hanes is also a member of the Center for a New American Security, a think tank that has received millions of dollars in funding from weapons contractors.
[02:43:32.036 --> 02:43:41.988]  CIA Director Gina Haspel will report directly to Hanes, who has repeatedly sung the praises of Haspel, a key architect of President George W. Bush's torture program.
[02:43:42.108 --> 02:43:44.408]  Well, I'm sure she's a nice person, too.
[02:43:44.589 --> 02:43:48.829]  The frontrunner to be Joe Biden's pick for Secretary of Defence is Michelle Flournoy.
[02:43:48.929 --> 02:44:04.133]  Flournoy is such a nice person that she... Well, Team Trump continues to get absolutely no support from the federal government in regards to its attempt to legally, professionally, properly, accurately count the votes in the US presidential election.
[02:44:04.933 --> 02:44:07.733]  This headline came out just about an hour ago out of zero.
[02:44:07.773 --> 02:44:11.194]  Hedge White House slams AG Barr's claims of no election fraud.
[02:44:11.966 --> 02:44:14.828]  There's been no semblance of a DOJ investigation.
[02:44:14.848 --> 02:44:25.655]  This was Attorney General William Barr who said today, the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
[02:44:26.175 --> 02:44:38.443]  That was immediately challenged by Trump's legal team, via Rudy Giuliani, who said, with all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn't been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation.
[02:44:39.031 --> 02:44:44.613]  We've gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states which they have not examined.
[02:44:45.113 --> 02:44:49.595]  We have many witnesses swearing in their oath they saw crimes being committed in connection with voter fraud.
[02:44:50.175 --> 02:44:53.377]  As far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed by the DOJ.
[02:44:53.717 --> 02:44:59.379]  The Justice Department also hasn't audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth.
[02:44:59.699 --> 02:45:03.901]  So again, yet another body within the federal government coming out and saying
[02:45:04.577 --> 02:45:15.484]  There's no evidence of voter fraud despite the fact they haven't even properly analysed the actual evidence of voter fraud being presented, which is being and will continue to be presented in the courts.
[02:45:16.324 --> 02:45:17.425]  So we have that going on.
[02:45:17.445 --> 02:45:26.991]  We also have this video which came back to prominence over the weekend, and we're going to play it here in a second, out of, of all places, CNN.
[02:45:27.531 --> 02:45:30.713]  And this caused a lot of consternation amongst the left headline,
[02:45:31.554 --> 02:45:36.798]  CNN, there are, quote, legal and constitutional ways for Trump to stay in office.
[02:45:37.278 --> 02:45:40.020]  This was a video released before the election.
[02:45:40.921 --> 02:45:51.308]  And in this video, CNN's Fareed Zakaria explains the legal and constitutional case by which President Trump could stay in office even if he loses the election.
[02:45:51.348 --> 02:45:53.970]  They didn't like seeing this one pop up again.
[02:45:54.650 --> 02:45:57.492]  And you'll find out why as we play it right now.
[02:45:57.612 --> 02:45:58.053]  Here it is.
[02:45:59.482 --> 02:46:05.968]  ...that are legal and constitutional that could enable Trump to stay in office without actually winning the vote.
[02:46:07.438 --> 02:46:12.921]  The system of electing the president is complicated because it was not designed to be directly democratic.
[02:46:13.621 --> 02:46:20.565]  The Constitution calls for states to choose the presidential electors, who in turn gather to vote for the president.
[02:46:21.386 --> 02:46:29.050]  Over time, states have passed laws that ensured their state's popular vote for the presidency would determine the electors.
[02:46:29.790 --> 02:46:32.472]  But those are laws, not a constitutional obligation.
[02:46:33.303 --> 02:46:35.844]  Now, imagine the scenario during election week.
[02:46:36.224 --> 02:46:40.025]  Trump is leading on November 3rd, but Joe Biden pulls ahead in the days following.
[02:46:40.405 --> 02:46:43.726]  Republicans file objections to tens of thousands of mail-in ballots.
[02:46:44.127 --> 02:46:47.668]  Democrats file counter suits, taking account of the confusion.
[02:46:48.268 --> 02:46:51.389]  Legislators decide to choose the electors themselves.
[02:46:52.637 --> 02:46:53.338]  Here's the worry.
[02:46:53.839 --> 02:46:57.844]  Of the nine swing states, eight have Republican legislatures.
[02:46:58.505 --> 02:47:07.997]  If one or more decide that balloting is chaotic and marred by irregularities, they could send what they regard as the legitimate slate of electors, which would be Republican.
[02:47:08.678 --> 02:47:10.659]  Democrats may object and file lawsuits.
[02:47:11.039 --> 02:47:17.102]  In some of those states, Democratic governors or secretaries of state could send their own slates of electors to Washington.
[02:47:17.662 --> 02:47:22.684]  That would add to the confusion, but that might well be part of the Republican plan.
[02:47:23.224 --> 02:47:31.808]  Because you see, when Congress convenes on January 6th to tally the electors' votes, there would be challenges to the legitimacy of some electors.
[02:47:32.853 --> 02:47:38.478]  It's possible congressional Republicans could decide that disputed states should simply not be counted.
[02:47:39.339 --> 02:47:42.381]  Suppose, in this scenario, Michigan's votes are invalidated.
[02:47:43.022 --> 02:47:48.086]  That would ensure that neither candidate would get to 270 electoral votes.
[02:47:49.047 --> 02:47:56.093]  At that point, the Constitution clearly directs that the House of Representatives vote to determine the presidential election.
[02:47:57.033 --> 02:48:01.037]  But it does so with each state casting a single ballot.
[02:48:02.170 --> 02:48:09.553]  If the current numbers hold, there would be 26 state delegations that are Republican and 23 Democratic, with one tied.
[02:48:10.113 --> 02:48:13.074]  So the outcome would be to re-elect Donald Trump.
[02:48:13.914 --> 02:48:18.896]  Trump doesn't need to do anything other than to simply accept this outcome, which is constitutional.
[02:48:20.476 --> 02:48:28.219]  So that caused a lot of consternation amongst leftists over the weekend, desperately pointing out, oh, but this video was released before the election!
[02:48:28.888 --> 02:48:30.289]  But it still stands, doesn't it?
[02:48:30.329 --> 02:48:51.460]  And you heard the explanation right there as to how Trump or Republicans, if they actually grew a spine, could actually challenge this election legally and constitutionally, which now seems like an even more urgent thing given that AG Barr, of course, Bosch appointee basically, has now said that he's not going to stand behind the Trump administration.
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:53.521]  No real surprise there.
[02:48:54.802 --> 02:48:58.144]  Meanwhile, we have this story, which went viral actually last week.
[02:48:59.366 --> 02:49:09.749]  Again going to the point, they say jump, you say how high, and it's not do as they do, it's do as they say in terms of coronavirus lockdowns.
[02:49:10.889 --> 02:49:19.231]  Headline, Doctor Who demanded mandatory mask law, pictured partying maskless on boat surrounded by bikini clad women.
[02:49:20.049 --> 02:49:25.491]  The world's so-called hottest doctor, who's repeatedly called for mandatory mask laws and social distancing.
[02:49:25.771 --> 02:49:37.234]  This is a guy that they trotted out on CNN every other week to demand that you wear a mask, to demand that you don't see your friends and relatives, to demand that you follow all these arbitrary laws.
[02:49:37.634 --> 02:49:39.375]  This was one of their main guys.
[02:49:39.775 --> 02:49:49.558]  Lo and behold, he's out in Miami on his 31st birthday, surrounded by bikini women, performing no social distancing whatsoever.
[02:49:50.248 --> 02:50:00.170]  Mikhail Vysharsky, known as Dr Mike Online, completely contradicted his own advice by throwing a super spreader 31st birthday party for himself.
[02:50:01.130 --> 02:50:05.271]  He was surrounded by 14 other people, most of them women wearing bikinis.
[02:50:06.151 --> 02:50:12.773]  Another video shows the doctor massaging a woman's neck on the deck of the boat while wearing a face scarf that isn't even covering his nose.
[02:50:12.993 --> 02:50:14.573]  But he's gonna tell you what to do.
[02:50:14.633 --> 02:50:17.894]  He's gonna tell you you can't hug your gran at Thanksgiving.
[02:50:19.781 --> 02:50:26.926]  This is a guy who tweeted, quote, if by not wearing a mask, you put others lives at risk, it might make sense to make it mandatory.
[02:50:26.967 --> 02:50:27.647]  Wouldn't you agree?
[02:50:28.047 --> 02:50:33.351]  Unless you're on a luxury boat having a birthday bash surrounded by scantily clad women.
[02:50:33.792 --> 02:50:37.334]  Apparently, if you're Dr. Mike, then that makes it OK.
[02:50:37.855 --> 02:50:42.678]  He also told Fox Business, wearing a mask decreases the spread of the virus.
[02:50:43.019 --> 02:50:45.821]  And that is of utmost importance for people's health.
[02:50:46.886 --> 02:50:51.789]  So if you're going outside in public and are going to be around other people, wear a mask!
[02:50:52.490 --> 02:51:01.355]  Apart from if you're Dr. Mike on his luxury boat, surrounded by his girls in bikinis, then that apparently doesn't apply.
[02:51:02.055 --> 02:51:05.297]  Again, this has cropped up time and time again.
[02:51:05.337 --> 02:51:09.040]  We had Pelosi not wearing a mask when she was in the hairdressers.
[02:51:10.220 --> 02:51:14.103]  We had other Congresswomen inside Congress not wearing masks.
[02:51:14.901 --> 02:51:21.003]  We've got Sam Liccardo today, the mayor of San Jose, having to issue a public apology.
[02:51:21.703 --> 02:51:24.124]  He just tweeted this about an hour ago.
[02:51:24.264 --> 02:51:29.146]  I apologize for my decision to gather for Thanksgiving with my family, contrary to the rules.
[02:51:29.206 --> 02:51:33.147]  And again, it's not just that these people break the rules and they're in positions of power.
[02:51:33.427 --> 02:51:37.629]  It's that they endlessly lecture you about the rules and break them themselves.
[02:51:38.089 --> 02:51:44.231]  You had the ABC News correspondent constantly lecturing other reporters about not wearing masks.
[02:51:44.811 --> 02:51:48.554]  Pictures come out of him on Cinco de Mayo, walking around New York.
[02:51:48.654 --> 02:51:50.055]  Everyone else is wearing a mask.
[02:51:50.455 --> 02:51:51.496]  He's not wearing one.
[02:51:51.816 --> 02:51:53.978]  The rules don't apply to them.
[02:51:54.939 --> 02:52:05.647]  Now, Sam Liccardo, the mayor of San Jose, has issued a grovelling apology, saying, I understand my obligation as a public official to provide exemplary complaints with public health orders and not to ignore them.
[02:52:06.227 --> 02:52:12.812]  And yet he did anyway, because again, he's not subject to the rules that he himself creates.
[02:52:13.681 --> 02:52:17.283]  Neither is apparently LA Supervisor Sheila Kuehl.
[02:52:17.303 --> 02:52:19.364]  This is a Breitbart headline.
[02:52:19.424 --> 02:52:23.587]  Dines at outdoor restaurant after voting to ban outdoor dining.
[02:52:24.107 --> 02:52:33.833]  Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl reportedly dined at an outdoor restaurant in Santa Monica hours after casting a decisive vote to ban outdoor dining in the county.
[02:52:34.453 --> 02:52:37.016]  Of course, Governor Newsom did exactly the same.
[02:52:37.496 --> 02:52:40.378]  Passed a law banning dining inside.
[02:52:40.499 --> 02:52:50.387]  Of course, the next day he's pictured in a fancy French restaurant, surrounded by other people from a medical board association, by the way, dining indoors.
[02:52:50.687 --> 02:52:52.809]  They don't subject themselves to the rules.
[02:52:53.049 --> 02:52:54.911]  The rules are only for you plebs.
[02:52:55.331 --> 02:53:04.115]  And you'll get lectured and called a terrible person and told that you're killing granny if you behave in the exact same way that they do time and time again.
[02:53:05.156 --> 02:53:09.418]  Bill Mulligan of local Fox affiliate KTTV11 reported Monday.
[02:53:10.358 --> 02:53:24.285]  During Tuesday's LA County Board of Supervisors meeting, Kuehl referred to outside dining as a quote, most dangerous situation of what she described as a risk of tables of unmasked patrons potentially exposing their servers to coronavirus
[02:53:24.941 --> 02:53:29.325]  She said this is a serious health emergency and we must take it seriously.
[02:53:30.145 --> 02:53:36.650]  But then she proceeded to do precisely that, violate her own rules and not take it seriously.
[02:53:38.152 --> 02:53:40.634]  Again, they don't follow their own directives.
[02:53:40.814 --> 02:53:42.655]  Only you, the plebs, are forced to do that.
[02:53:43.776 --> 02:53:47.579]  Almost as if they know that the virus isn't as serious as they make it out to be.
[02:53:48.540 --> 02:53:52.283]  Meanwhile, CBC journalist brags about ratting out worshippers at church.
[02:53:53.231 --> 02:54:01.818]  This was a journalist who, now that journalists are activists and not actual journalists, they just rat people out, get people deplatformed, publicly shame people.
[02:54:02.279 --> 02:54:09.505]  She basically sat outside a church in British Columbia, Canada, ratted out everyone leaving the church, including children playing in the parking lot.
[02:54:09.865 --> 02:54:11.947]  She is another journalistic hero.
[02:54:12.167 --> 02:54:12.988]  That's going to wrap it up.
[02:54:13.028 --> 02:54:15.270]  Summit.News coming up next, Warren with Owen Schroyer.
[02:54:15.630 --> 02:54:16.111]  Don't go away.
[02:54:26.758 --> 02:54:29.920]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[02:54:30.220 --> 02:54:31.021]  Don't let them win.
[02:54:31.401 --> 02:54:36.205]  Go to our emergency election newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:54:36.445 --> 02:54:40.007]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[02:54:40.348 --> 02:54:42.649]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:54:42.849 --> 02:54:45.311]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[02:54:45.651 --> 02:54:56.279]  If you want to fight the globalists, if you want to resist the new order takeover and the great reset, then be part of what my good friend Jason and Burma's coined the other day, the great resistance.
[02:54:56.977 --> 02:54:59.319]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:05.825]  And the answer to the Great Reset is the Great Renaissance, or the Great Resistance.
[02:55:06.566 --> 02:55:14.352]  And that starts at InfoWars.com and Band.Video, where our views and support is exploding when it comes to actual visitors.
[02:55:14.733 --> 02:55:17.896]  But when it comes to financing our operation, money's actually gone down.
[02:55:18.516 --> 02:55:19.797]  I guess people think, well, Jones is right.
[02:55:19.817 --> 02:55:20.658]  He must have lots of support.
[02:55:20.698 --> 02:55:21.359]  No, that's not the case.
[02:55:21.759 --> 02:55:22.861]  We need financial support.
[02:55:23.181 --> 02:55:24.422]  Plus, we have great products you need.

[02:56:08.804 --> 02:56:19.731]  It's been a year full of sales because the country's in an emergency, the economy's breaking down, but I want you to get your ultimate fish oil, your ultimate turmeric bodies formula, your DNA Force Plus, your X2, your X3, your Ultra 12.
[02:56:19.931 --> 02:56:23.993]  I want you to get back in stock everything sold out for a year with the COVID shutdown, we couldn't get it.
[02:56:24.274 --> 02:56:28.096]  Alpha Power, it's all there discounted and with promo code PAYFREE at
[02:56:28.596 --> 02:56:30.217]  Look, all of my pitches to you are 100% straight up.
[02:56:30.237 --> 02:56:32.439]  I'm always a straight shooter, but with what's happening in the country,
[02:56:58.885 --> 02:57:02.868]  In the last month of 2020, I'm just going to be completely honest.
[02:57:03.548 --> 02:57:05.289]  I need money to keep fighting the globalists.
[02:57:06.210 --> 02:57:09.352]  I need money to have this crew and to run this independent media operation.
[02:57:09.692 --> 02:57:10.493]  Let me explain something.
[02:57:12.254 --> 02:57:14.155]  Apple is a trillion dollar company.
[02:57:14.956 --> 02:57:16.997]  Google's like a 900 billion dollar company.
[02:57:18.178 --> 02:57:25.303]  All those big tech companies have spent hundreds of billions of dollars to develop their own infrastructure.
[02:57:26.644 --> 02:57:35.751]  I'm very proud of my five man IT team that we have banned on video and our own video platform that reaches like 10 million people a day.
[02:57:35.791 --> 02:57:45.219]  And we have our own streams, our own satellite uplinks for radio and TV, our own email servers, everything we have to do ourselves.
[02:57:45.279 --> 02:57:45.900]  I'm not a victim.
[02:57:45.940 --> 02:57:46.440]  I'm not bitching.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:52.545]  I'm just simply saying it took a lot with them deplatforming us three years ago.
[02:57:53.277 --> 02:57:57.379]  And all the Democrat lawsuits and all the attacks to stay on air to this moment.
[02:57:57.479 --> 02:57:59.500]  I spent basically almost everything I've got.
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:03.982]  I mortgaged my house because I knew it would come down to the wire right now.
[02:58:04.342 --> 02:58:06.143]  And now people can see how close it is.
[02:58:06.163 --> 02:58:08.064]  This race against good versus evil.
[02:58:08.164 --> 02:58:08.324]  So.
[02:58:09.724 --> 02:58:11.365]  First, I want to thank you for keeping us on the air.
[02:58:11.385 --> 02:58:12.406]  I want to salute you.
[02:58:12.426 --> 02:58:18.170]  I want to tell you, hey, you've done an amazing job and we've done a pretty good job as well, not giving up.
[02:58:18.230 --> 02:58:22.793]  But I'm asking you right now to realize that we've come so far together.
[02:58:23.254 --> 02:58:25.195]  We don't want the globalists to win.
[02:58:25.775 --> 02:58:28.757]  So listen, I've got great products you need.
[02:58:29.638 --> 02:58:30.899]  Air filtration for your house.
[02:58:31.259 --> 02:58:33.261]  Highest quality four-stage ion filter.
[02:58:33.821 --> 02:58:35.302]  Way below any competition.
[02:58:35.662 --> 02:58:36.223]  Best deal.
[02:58:36.623 --> 02:58:37.524]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:58:37.924 --> 02:58:38.925]  The water filtration.
[02:58:39.884 --> 02:58:40.544]  Alexa Pure.
[02:58:41.105 --> 02:58:41.885]  Highest rated.
[02:58:41.905 --> 02:58:44.087]  One of the top ones out there for the price you pay.
[02:58:44.287 --> 02:58:44.807]  You can't beat it.
[02:58:45.507 --> 02:58:50.050]  The supplements, the films, the books, the t-shirts.
[02:58:50.370 --> 02:58:53.972]  All of it is really high quality and it funds our operation.
[02:58:53.992 --> 02:58:55.153]  I want to stay in this fight.
[02:58:55.633 --> 02:58:56.574]  That's all I care about.
[02:58:56.594 --> 02:58:57.615]  I've been fighting so long.
[02:58:57.635 --> 02:58:59.135]  27 years on air.
[02:58:59.476 --> 02:59:00.416]  You've kept me in the fight.
[02:59:00.436 --> 02:59:06.300]  We're in this together, but I'm telling you right now, as we close out 2020 and enter into this future,
[02:59:07.020 --> 02:59:10.889]  The globalists did not count on us being on air at this time.
[02:59:11.551 --> 02:59:14.577]  So the revolutionary act of you going to InfoWareStore.com
[02:59:15.816 --> 02:59:26.940]  And getting fish oil, or getting Brain Force, or getting DNA Force Plus, or getting X2, or getting Vaso Beans, or getting Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula, or Alpha Power.
[02:59:27.821 --> 02:59:33.063]  All of that gets you a great product and then funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:59:33.523 --> 02:59:35.964]  Can you imagine the world without InfoWars?
[02:59:36.264 --> 02:59:39.645]  Can you imagine if we hadn't been on the air in the last 27 years?
[02:59:39.985 --> 02:59:43.347]  Can you imagine what would have happened to you and countless others?
[02:59:44.246 --> 02:59:49.398]  Had he supported us, we would not be in a position right now to even be able to contend with the Globalists.
[02:59:49.758 --> 02:59:50.801]  We would have already been defeated.
[02:59:50.841 --> 02:59:51.943]  So, I'm going to tell you again.
[02:59:53.393 --> 02:59:54.914]  Now is the time for your word of mouth.
[02:59:55.214 --> 02:59:56.275]  Now is the time for your prayer.

[03:00:45.876 --> 03:00:51.018]  I told Vice Television four years ago that Trump was only one wave.
[03:00:51.518 --> 03:00:54.240]  That Trump was a manifestation of liberty and freedom.
[03:00:54.540 --> 03:00:55.380]  Look, I love Trump.
[03:00:55.760 --> 03:00:56.460]  I love myself.
[03:00:56.781 --> 03:00:58.681]  But people come and people go.
[03:00:58.881 --> 03:01:00.742]  This is about a mass awakening.
[03:01:00.842 --> 03:01:02.283]  This is about freedom.
[03:01:02.543 --> 03:01:04.144]  Here's a clip from Vice TV.
[03:01:04.324 --> 03:01:05.664]  Bigger waves are coming.
[03:01:06.405 --> 03:01:08.125]  We don't rise and fall with Trump.
[03:01:08.706 --> 03:01:10.906]  Now you're going to see the next wave.
[03:01:11.227 --> 03:01:11.887]  Good luck with that.
[03:01:12.970 --> 03:01:25.483]  So the world is so awake, populism is so explosive right now, that the globalists have created the COVID exaggeration, trying to lock society down and bring in martial law, because they want to bankrupt society.
[03:01:26.063 --> 03:01:29.867]  If they're successful, we're gonna have a long, hardcore depression.
[03:01:30.227 --> 03:01:33.851]  So, engage in a stopgap, engage in insurance
[03:01:34.231 --> 03:01:35.132]  We're good to go!
[03:02:00.031 --> 03:02:00.671]  Highest quality.

[03:02:07.354 --> 03:02:08.535]  Go get products you need.
[03:02:08.755 --> 03:02:09.615]  Prepare yourself.
[03:02:09.915 --> 03:02:11.096]  Don't be dependent on the system.

[03:02:22.761 --> 03:02:24.282]  We've come so far together, folks.
[03:02:24.662 --> 03:02:25.403]  I'm so exhausted.
[03:02:25.423 --> 03:02:27.085]  I'm not going to give you some slick ad.
[03:02:27.105 --> 03:02:28.846]  I'm just going to say, we got great products.
[03:02:29.167 --> 03:02:29.947]  We support you.
[03:02:30.208 --> 03:02:31.589]  Support us in this damn fight.

[03:02:37.975 --> 03:02:44.782]  But whatever you do, pray for freedom, pray for an awakening, and support the InfoWare and say, God damn you to hell, Bill Gates.
