[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:07.951]  You don't step in the bear trap, and if you're already in the bear trap, you gotta get people that are nearby to come help you and recognize it's a bear trap and get it off your leg.
[00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:09.891]  But see, we don't do that.
[00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:11.371]  We're like, no, this isn't a bear trap.
[00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:12.832]  We're like, it's all lies.
[00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:15.352]  It didn't kill the number they said.
[00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:16.933]  They count regular deaths as it.
[00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.413]  They'll never let us out of the lockdown.
[00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:19.293]  They're now admitting that.
[00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:27.735]  This is about a total takeover, a post-human future, where robots will have to deliver us all our food and self-driving cars, and that's those of us that have resources, and then that'll be destroyed.
[00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:39.124]  And the public is going to absolute crater and go crazy, so they're going to roll out all these amnesiac drugs, just drug everybody out, then they're going to lay on the side of the street until they die, and then robot trucks are going to arrive and take the bodies away.
[00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:46.650]  We're not going to call it euthanasia, but we're all going to be glad that billions are going to be committing suicide by the end of the decade.
[00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:51.373]  Hundreds of millions are going to starve to death conservatively in the next few years.
[00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:55.496]  This is the end, my friends, my only friends.
[00:00:56.468 --> 00:00:58.709]  Because of their elaborate plans, the end!
[00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:04.632]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:07.773 --> 00:01:12.876]  The Illuminati criminal pedophile Satan Network is now trying to crash the U.S.
[00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:15.657]  dollar, and in the United States as we know it.
[00:01:16.198 --> 00:01:20.760]  Remember who your enemies are, and remember if they're successful, who will pay.
[00:01:21.963 --> 00:01:29.307]  The 2016 deposition of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sex slave Virginia Roberts read like a movie script.
[00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:40.812]  Sexually abused runaway has a chance encounter with an elite pedo pimp over a massage book she checked out at the library and is thrust into a powerful den of iniquity.
[00:01:41.172 --> 00:02:04.866]  Years later, Roberts would find herself swimming upstream against a heavy current of an unresponsive FBI, the venomous media, and the powerful figures she had also accused of abuse that includes, at the very least, billionaire hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin, Prince Andrew, French fashion mogul Jean-Luc Brunel, former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson,
[00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:08.388]  A spokesperson's response reads, in part, AI researcher Marvin Minsky
[00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.883]  After his 2008 conviction for soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.
[00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:50.183]  And the director of the university's renowned media lab, Joe Ito, stepped down after a whistleblower told the New Yorker's Ronan Farrow that quote, although Epstein was listed as disqualified in MIT's official donor database, the media lab continued to accept gifts from him, consulted him about the use of the funds, and by marking his contributions as anonymous, avoided disclosing their full extent.
[00:02:50.683 --> 00:03:00.029]  And though Harvard University says it rejected donations from Epstein after his conviction, the university is reviewing any indirect ways his money might have benefited Harvard.
[00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.451]  High-powered attorney Alan Dershowitz...
[00:03:20.723 --> 00:03:24.084]  But when you were on Petto Island, or at his place, when you borrowed his place in Palm Beach, or your house in New York,
[00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:42.794]  With my grandchildren.
[00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:48.735]  Okay, but every picture I've ever seen of his properties, you see young women around.
[00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:52.016]  Were there no young women when you were on his plane or any of his properties?
[00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:52.476]  Absolutely not.
[00:03:52.496 --> 00:03:56.477]  I never saw him in the presence of a young woman when I was there with my children and grandchildren.
[00:03:56.777 --> 00:04:07.479]  And of course, former President Bill Clinton, who according to flight logs, flew on the Lolita Express as many as 26 times, was spotted on Epstein's Island
[00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:14.946]  I saw Bill Clinton sitting with Jeffrey on the living room porch area, which was Jeffrey's favorite spot.
[00:04:16.528 --> 00:04:18.770]  I saw no other guests there at that time at all.
[00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:23.395]  I just said, hey, wow, Jeffrey's sitting with Bill Clinton.
[00:04:23.956 --> 00:04:25.757]  And of course denies everything.
[00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:30.002]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:34.470]  I don't think he could have done any worse than what's happened.
[00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.813]  It's such an embarrassment to him.
[00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:37.256]  I mean, I see him walking around.
[00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:39.241]  It's like a terrible embarrassment.
[00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:49.155]  What anyone can gather after reading Robert's deposition is that Maxwell is just as abusive, if not far more, than Epstein.
[00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:57.682]  Maxwell allegedly abused Roberts and countless other girls insatiably, and appears to have been the one wielding the pimp stick.
[00:04:57.962 --> 00:05:08.011]  And what's lurking on the horizon are two more depositions that remain under seal after Maxwell filed an emergency motion with the Federal Appeals Court in Manhattan.
[00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:10.153]  To keep them from becoming public.
[00:05:10.313 --> 00:05:12.035]  But that court has yet to rule.
[00:05:12.255 --> 00:05:15.278]  Those depositions could be unsealed any day now.
[00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:23.626]  One of those depositions, filed in April 2016, according to Maxwell's lawyers, detail her sordid sex life.
[00:05:23.846 --> 00:05:29.968]  Maxwell's attorneys claim that its release could make it difficult, if not impossible, to get a fair trial.
[00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:47.434]  In actuality, the public will see Maxwell for who she truly is, not the assistant to Epstein, or the occasional partaker in Epstein's debauched crimes, but a central figure obsessed with abusing teenage girls and increasing her power.
[00:05:47.795 --> 00:05:49.015]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:54.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, August 3rd.
[00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:54.941]  The year is 2020.
[00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:56.882]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:56.902 --> 00:05:59.303]  This is not a spectator sport.
[00:05:59.463 --> 00:06:00.963]  This is a war for human liberty.
[00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:03.405]  Please spread the live links and tell folks about local stations.
[00:06:04.225 --> 00:06:06.966]  We are 91 days out from the election.
[00:06:08.327 --> 00:06:10.508]  And I have to remember to just breathe.
[00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:15.710]  But as we told you, the writing was on the wall.
[00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.571]  The quickening is here.
[00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:40.305]  You know, I've thought about doing a podcast once a week where I don't speak from my own analysis of the world, but where I only highlight articles and make that the podcast, reading different sections of articles on air and different video clips.
[00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:42.046]  And I intend to do that.
[00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:43.366]  I intend to launch a podcast to
[00:06:45.302 --> 00:06:51.367]  With callers and listeners of the show, we've done a few of those, but we've got a lot of things that are important that need to be done.
[00:06:51.387 --> 00:06:58.933]  And a lot of it's because they're facets of the show I've always wanted to do that I've never had the will to do.
[00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:10.261]  Let's see today if I could spend the next nine minutes left in this segment just reading headlines.
[00:07:11.062 --> 00:07:11.923]  Here, let's do that.
[00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:13.244]  And I'll tell you where they're from.
[00:07:13.644 --> 00:07:14.224]  Infowars.com.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.344]  Minneapolis authorities warn residents prepare to be robbed and obey criminals.
[00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:23.306]  Here's another one from the Gateway Pundit.
[00:07:23.326 --> 00:07:26.809]  Minneapolis Police Department tells residents to cooperate with criminals.
[00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:28.090]  Do as they say.
[00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.152]  Give up your wallet, purse, and cell phone.
[00:07:30.172 --> 00:07:30.772]  Those are quotes.
[00:07:32.854 --> 00:07:37.538]  Chicago area leaders call for Illinois to abolish history classes.
[00:07:37.698 --> 00:07:38.539]  NBC News.

[00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:48.916]  City Police Departments.
[00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:52.718]  And guess who they're redirecting the money to?
[00:07:53.158 --> 00:07:54.599]  The Soros Control Group.
[00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:56.279]  Sorry, I said I wouldn't give my commentary.
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.561]  Continuing.
[00:07:59.181 --> 00:07:59.821]  Shakedown!

[00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:10.767]  Columbia host deconstructing whiteness workshop
[00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.791]  We're white-identified students.
[00:08:16.893 --> 00:08:18.854]  Yeah, it's Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:08:18.955 --> 00:08:20.896]  It's the learned helplessness.
[00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:27.880]  Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says, don't call the police when you're raped.
[00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:29.261]  Call a counselor.
[00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:32.103]  This is real, folks.
[00:08:33.224 --> 00:08:38.788]  Billionaire sex offender Epstein once claimed he co-founded Clinton Foundation.
[00:08:39.068 --> 00:08:40.169]  He did, in court documents.
[00:08:40.189 --> 00:08:41.530]  It's a shakedown organization.
[00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:46.384]  200 plus raise awareness of sex trafficking in Arizona rally.
[00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:49.006]  Hundreds take over CNN LA.

[00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.243]  Let's continue here over to the COVID stack.
[00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:12.676]  Melbourne lockdown.
[00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:15.877]  Police in inner homes without a warrant to carry out spot checks.
[00:09:15.917 --> 00:09:18.778]  See the newscast at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:25.180]  Graduates of elite universities dominate New York Times and Wall Street Journal study finds.
[00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:28.321]  Dollar sends warnings that U.S.
[00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:29.842]  is losing its grip on virus.
[00:09:31.182 --> 00:09:34.824]  The bankers are saying submit to a lockdown or we're going to kill the economy.
[00:09:36.264 --> 00:09:39.085]  The Fed is planning to send money directly to Americans in next crisis.
[00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:42.730]  Top Federal Reserve official says U.S.
[00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.852]  needs another lockdown to save the economy.
[00:09:44.872 --> 00:09:49.196]  Yeah, it's like you already have a couple bullet holes in your head and they're like, well, you need another bullet hole in your head.
[00:09:49.216 --> 00:09:52.699]  Sorry, I said I wouldn't give commentary.
[00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:53.619]  U.S.
[00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:59.204]  manufacturing PMI worryingly weak as ISM spikes to 16-month highs.
[00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:05.609]  A vaccine may not be the magical cure everybody anticipates.
[00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:06.350]  Zero edge.
[00:10:09.636 --> 00:10:17.460]  Back to Melbourne, hundreds of police surround towers, blocks to enforce coronavirus lockdown, not allowed to leave your home ever.
[00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:21.162]  Your dogs must defecate on the floor.

[00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:34.490]  But Bricks warns
[00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:36.931]  U.S.'
[00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:40.792]  's new phase of coronavirus pandemic with more widespread cases.
[00:10:40.832 --> 00:10:43.613]  Yes, this is designed to say everybody's positive.
[00:10:44.153 --> 00:10:45.353]  Never had the flu or the cold.
[00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:51.175]  Stories of economic despair from America's worst economic downturn since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
[00:10:51.295 --> 00:10:54.675]  And then it really gets into the serious news.
[00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:56.916]  We're going to cover this in detail next segment.
[00:10:58.188 --> 00:11:04.751]  Federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials on how best to persuade Americans to take COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:07.693]  Wait till we read this from GatewayPundit.com.
[00:11:08.273 --> 00:11:13.996]  Red flags soar as Big Pharma will be exempt from COVID-19 vaccine study claims.
[00:11:14.316 --> 00:11:16.017]  We'll get more into that stack next segment.
[00:11:17.421 --> 00:11:18.722]  And then let's move on over here.
[00:11:18.742 --> 00:11:28.146]  Scandemic CDC stats show flu deaths dropped as COVID deaths increased at the exact number in every state following NIH guidelines.
[00:11:29.327 --> 00:11:33.489]  And we've had a statistician actually get their own numbers and put it all together.
[00:11:35.089 --> 00:11:37.451]  That's coming up.
[00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:45.458]  Meanwhile, George Soros steps in, drops six-figure check to rescue corrupt St.
[00:11:45.518 --> 00:11:49.401]  Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner in her primary race.
[00:11:50.942 --> 00:12:04.151]  He dropped $600,000 on the new incoming district attorney we have, who openly says abolish the police, and the official city council budget says blow up the police station in a sign of ending police hate.
[00:12:05.052 --> 00:12:07.954]  Yeah, that's what communist takeovers look like, all run by billionaires.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:17.102]  George Soros has been rounding people up, putting them in death camps since he was 14, and he thinks he's gonna get you.
[00:12:17.702 --> 00:12:18.242]  Remember that.
[00:12:18.462 --> 00:12:22.403]  And he's got most of the prosecutors under his control, federal and state, now.
[00:12:24.004 --> 00:12:25.504]  Let's continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:27.005 --> 00:12:36.308]  We're going to look at the latest on Trump pressuring TikTok, a ChaiCom company, to be bought by Microsoft.
[00:12:36.748 --> 00:12:40.809]  Microsoft says talks over TikTok potential purchase to worm up
[00:12:42.742 --> 00:12:47.084]  And to wrap up, September 15th, in any event, after CEO speaks with Trump.
[00:12:48.264 --> 00:12:56.127]  Meanwhile, despite sinking hospitalization rate, Austin to keep coronavirus restrictions in place and keep the parks closed.
[00:12:56.407 --> 00:12:57.107]  Oh, of course.
[00:12:59.008 --> 00:13:01.409]  There's so much more we're going to be breaking down today.
[00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:09.392]  SpaceX, Capsule, and NASA crew make first splashdown in 45 years, building a pro-human future.
[00:13:09.772 --> 00:13:11.413]  Good to see some glimmers of hope.
[00:13:13.311 --> 00:13:14.131]  On that front.
[00:13:16.432 --> 00:13:23.055]  Now, separately, ladies and gentlemen, I did a pretty good job there, I think, of reading headlines, giving limited commentary, but I still gave some commentary.
[00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:40.442]  In the future, when I do maybe segments of the show or maybe whole hours of the show or maybe a special show, I'm going to highlight everything in consensual order that I want to read and then go through those stacks and through those quotes and documents of the full show and not have one
[00:13:43.944 --> 00:13:48.930]  I don't think anybody's ever really done something quite like that before.
[00:13:50.392 --> 00:13:57.020]  So we'll see if that is an innovation, but you've got my commitment to do extra shows right through the next 91 days.
[00:13:58.905 --> 00:14:03.109]  And you know it's just going to get crazier, but I won't just be here at 11 a.m.
[00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:03.950]  to 3 p.m.
[00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:04.471]  every day.
[00:14:04.491 --> 00:14:07.694]  We're going to be doing a few days a week nighttime shows.
[00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:12.539]  I came in the last two Saturdays, more than the last two, and I did special Saturday transmissions.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.485]  Normally we go 2 to 5, 3 to 5, 3 to 6, 3 to 7, depending on what's happening.
[00:14:17.965 --> 00:14:21.369]  We also have the crew out covering all the antifa and communist rioting.
[00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:29.732]  Behavior in Austin, a lot of spectacular events unfolded there that are all at Band.Video and of course InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:14:30.632 --> 00:14:36.914]  So please don't forget that you're awake, you're informed, you're engaged, you're involved, you're the salt of the earth, we salute you and we thank you.
[00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:46.537]  But the way we win the information war, the way we bypass the censorship that's so key to the enemy winning, is when you get upset and you get angry and you get focused and you
[00:14:46.897 --> 00:14:55.319]  Print up Bandot video on cards with a simple message, or you tell people word of mouth every day, or you send out links on your email, or your text message, or on Facebook, or on Twitter.
[00:14:55.779 --> 00:14:57.259]  And you know, do what Zuckerberg says.
[00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:00.220]  He says, you can say Alex Jones's name as long as you attack him.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.380]  So be sarcastic.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.741]  Say, the worst person in the world.
[00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:07.302]  That's what the Wall Street Journal and New York Times and Globe and Mail call me.
[00:15:07.822 --> 00:15:09.022]  The scum of the earth.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.161]  That filth that talked about Epstein and the Global Clinton Foundation 15 years ago.
[00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:14.882]  He's on air.
[00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:16.482]  Look at his damn website.
[00:15:16.502 --> 00:15:17.623]  He ought to be shut down.
[00:15:18.783 --> 00:15:20.924]  And the AI sees that and it doesn't do anything.
[00:15:22.644 --> 00:15:23.845]  Computers don't get humor, folks.
[00:15:23.865 --> 00:15:25.485]  That's why they have such trouble with memes.
[00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:27.526]  That's why they fear it so much.
[00:15:27.546 --> 00:15:29.847]  It's like Rudy's Barbecue.
[00:15:29.867 --> 00:15:31.367]  It says we have the worst barbecue in Texas.
[00:15:31.387 --> 00:15:32.028]  It's some of the best.
[00:15:32.308 --> 00:15:32.888]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:32.908 --> 00:15:33.388]  Stay with us.
[00:15:34.709 --> 00:15:38.750]  Yeah, we came up with that liner a few years ago when Trump got elected.
[00:15:39.821 --> 00:15:42.362]  That we recaptured Texas, but we've lost it again.
[00:15:42.862 --> 00:15:45.604]  The governor has turned himself over to the New World Order.
[00:15:46.264 --> 00:15:55.508]  He's ordered the nursing homes to stay closed right into October, which is a death sentence, and families can't go see them.
[00:15:55.728 --> 00:15:56.808]  They're locked down prisoners.
[00:15:57.369 --> 00:15:58.989]  And of course, that's where most of the deaths have happened.
[00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:05.412]  And of course, in Democrat states, they shipped sick people into those nursing homes so they'd get death numbers.
[00:16:05.452 --> 00:16:08.233]  That's about half the deaths that have happened.
[00:16:09.554 --> 00:16:12.755]  Let's go into another great find by the Gateway Pundit.
[00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:15.796]  And this story is public.
[00:16:16.377 --> 00:16:22.139]  If you're a radio listener, it links directly to the federal government and Yale and the taxpayer study.
[00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:25.200]  And that's the crazy part about this.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.201]  In the past, they would try to hide stuff like this.
[00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:34.203]  But now Gates goes, okay, 100% of people that take my vaccine trial are getting sick.
[00:16:34.804 --> 00:16:35.984]  20% are going to the hospital.
[00:16:36.024 --> 00:16:37.085]  A bunch are getting paralyzed.
[00:16:37.525 --> 00:16:38.005]  Some are dying.
[00:16:39.619 --> 00:16:39.999]  Big deal.
[00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:40.819]  You will take it.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.961]  The FDA will approve it, even though they skip animal trials.
[00:16:47.182 --> 00:16:48.022]  And you will take it.
[00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:57.106]  And then they're developing the psychology of, if you don't do it, you're going to get other people sick.
[00:16:57.346 --> 00:17:00.647]  But I thought, if they took it, they were safe.
[00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:10.097]  And then Gates goes on and admits on national TV that actually, when we give you five shots, it looks like you don't even stay immune for more than a few months.
[00:17:11.138 --> 00:17:25.229]  I mean, that's in the trials because it's not what you'd think of as a vaccine or a piece of the pathogen of the virus, of the bacteria, is attenuated or engineered to supposedly be harmless.
[00:17:27.011 --> 00:17:30.314]  And then your T-lymphocyte blood cells, white blood cells,
[00:17:31.874 --> 00:17:46.216]  The generals, the special white blood cells, the racist cells, they go in and they recognize it and then teach the body to have an autoimmune response.
[00:17:48.891 --> 00:17:56.256]  These vaccines, the RNA vaccines, go in and reprogram the nuclei of the cell.
[00:17:56.857 --> 00:18:02.801]  They hope to produce a protein that blocks the receptor site on cells.
[00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.864]  And they admit this is a giant experiment.
[00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:13.289]  So what's really going on is giant guinea pig trials altering humans' DNA from Big Pharma.
[00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:17.192]  Just like they alter a tomato or corn or soybeans.
[00:18:19.451 --> 00:18:23.114]  And they even joke in the news and say, is COVID-19 an alien?
[00:18:23.174 --> 00:18:24.035]  That was in Newsweek.
[00:18:24.295 --> 00:18:25.256]  That was in Time Magazine.
[00:18:25.296 --> 00:18:25.637]  Pull it up.
[00:18:25.657 --> 00:18:27.218]  Just, is COVID-19 an alien?
[00:18:28.339 --> 00:18:30.241]  Remember, I said that six months ago.
[00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:40.510]  I said, it's a chimera, five different viruses, that's never existed on the planet, with synthetic RNA put into it, separate from those viruses, to weld it together.
[00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:41.751]  It is alien.
[00:18:42.932 --> 00:18:43.813]  Not of this world.
[00:18:44.966 --> 00:18:48.709]  And now the headlines at Time Magazine are, is COVID-19 an alien?
[00:18:48.769 --> 00:18:49.749]  Yes, it's an alien.
[00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:52.692]  A lab-made alien.
[00:18:53.352 --> 00:18:53.992]  A chimera.
[00:18:54.793 --> 00:18:59.837]  Did chimeras exist when the Greeks imagined part lion, part snake, part goat?
[00:18:59.937 --> 00:19:00.137]  No.
[00:19:00.837 --> 00:19:01.698]  Does this exist?
[00:19:02.178 --> 00:19:02.839]  Yes, it exists.
[00:19:02.879 --> 00:19:04.060]  So, overhead shot please.
[00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:05.510]  Here's the article.
[00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:18.862]  Federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials on how best to persuade, that's brainwash, nudge, push, prod, force, Americans to take COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:19:18.902 --> 00:19:26.509]  In fact guys, go to an online thesaurus please and type in other words for persuade, convince, force,
[00:19:30.393 --> 00:19:31.554]  Let's read the whole article.
[00:19:50.066 --> 00:19:54.007]  The study is published at the government website on clinical trials.
[00:19:54.388 --> 00:19:55.448]  There's the little linky.
[00:19:56.068 --> 00:20:00.090]  The options they are studying include shame and anger techniques.
[00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.330]  How many times?
[00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:08.753]  I was on the green belt this morning and I probably walked by a hundred people conservatively and about 30 of them were wearing masks.
[00:20:08.993 --> 00:20:13.775]  And a couple times they put their hands on their hips and went, come on.
[00:20:14.855 --> 00:20:16.596]  Or, oh, you're British.
[00:20:16.676 --> 00:20:17.896]  Why are you passing on the left?
[00:20:18.277 --> 00:20:19.037]  Wear your mask.
[00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:23.252]  You go in a store, you're not wearing it, wear your mask!
[00:20:24.673 --> 00:20:25.894]  All a fraud, all a hoax.
[00:20:25.914 --> 00:20:31.858]  Oh, and they say, oh, we banned these doctors because one of them in the press conference said an M95 mask doesn't protect people.
[00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:32.358]  It doesn't!
[00:20:32.558 --> 00:20:36.881]  It says on the website, it doesn't stop what goes out, only what comes in.
[00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:37.962]  It's totally true!
[00:20:38.602 --> 00:20:41.164]  But it doesn't protect people who aren't wearing the mask.
[00:20:41.624 --> 00:20:42.745]  And then it doesn't work right.
[00:20:42.885 --> 00:20:45.307]  I mean, this is all facts, folks.
[00:20:45.687 --> 00:20:46.047]  Facts!
[00:20:46.107 --> 00:20:48.189]  They said 2.5 million would die, and it's 150,000.
[00:20:48.229 --> 00:20:48.609]  Most of it lies.
[00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.452]  It's facts that the N95 mask doesn't protect those outside the mask.
[00:20:54.952 --> 00:20:55.533]  It's a fact!
[00:20:55.773 --> 00:20:56.173]  A fact!
[00:20:56.393 --> 00:20:56.733]  A fact!
[00:20:56.913 --> 00:20:59.535]  But Fauci says we don't listen to hundreds of other doctors.
[00:20:59.815 --> 00:21:03.677]  We listen to Dr. Gates, who isn't a doctor.
[00:21:03.697 --> 00:21:05.918]  Oh, I'm sorry, let's continue.
[00:21:06.018 --> 00:21:10.540]  The options they are studying to brainwash the public include shame and anger techniques.
[00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.263]  They have baseline message, control message,
[00:21:17.244 --> 00:21:18.445]  Personal freedom message.
[00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:20.507]  Economic freedom message.
[00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.750]  This is where they say, oh, get the economy going.
[00:21:24.912 --> 00:21:27.795]  You see all this brainwashing, these 15 tactics in the news?
[00:21:28.395 --> 00:21:32.299]  Oh, the Federal Reserve says we'll all be poor and die if we don't keep things shut and wear masks forever.
[00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:33.421]  Of course, it's the opposite.
[00:21:34.442 --> 00:21:37.264]  Oh, you just be tough and get the economy going.
[00:21:37.285 --> 00:21:38.546]  But it's meant to stop the economy.
[00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:40.867]  Control message.
[00:21:40.887 --> 00:21:42.128]  We need to control this disease.
[00:21:42.428 --> 00:21:43.209]  Baseline message.
[00:21:43.249 --> 00:21:44.650]  We need to lower that baseline.
[00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.151]  Personal freedom message.
[00:21:46.191 --> 00:21:47.212]  You'll be free by doing this.
[00:21:47.972 --> 00:21:49.414]  Economic freedom message.
[00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:50.354]  It saves the economy.
[00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:51.756]  Self-interest message.
[00:21:51.796 --> 00:21:52.676]  Take care of yourself.
[00:21:53.057 --> 00:21:54.198]  Community interest message.
[00:21:54.238 --> 00:21:55.178]  It's for your community.
[00:21:55.198 --> 00:21:55.919]  It's for your town.
[00:21:55.959 --> 00:21:56.880]  We're in this all together.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.041]  You sure are a hero.
[00:21:58.461 --> 00:21:59.662]  Economic benefit message.
[00:21:59.702 --> 00:22:01.403]  Again, it'll save the country, save the economy.
[00:22:01.644 --> 00:22:03.425]  Just put on the chains for now.
[00:22:03.485 --> 00:22:04.366]  Put the handcuffs on.
[00:22:04.626 --> 00:22:05.727]  Let me take you into the basement.
[00:22:05.787 --> 00:22:06.608]  I promise I'll be nice.
[00:22:07.523 --> 00:22:08.183]  Guilt message.
[00:22:08.223 --> 00:22:09.864]  You're going to get other people sick.
[00:22:11.244 --> 00:22:13.465]  You're a bad person, you monster.
[00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:18.087]  That's people are shooting up hotels and pizzerias and beating people up and attack them and run them over with cars.
[00:22:18.107 --> 00:22:18.827]  You're not wearing a mask.
[00:22:19.567 --> 00:22:20.467]  Embarrassment message.
[00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:23.248]  Oh, you're not wearing your mask.
[00:22:23.769 --> 00:22:25.529]  You know, you're a bad person hurting.
[00:22:25.589 --> 00:22:26.490]  You're a racist.
[00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.531]  Oh, you gun owners are all behind the mass shootings.
[00:22:29.571 --> 00:22:30.291]  Turn your guns in.
[00:22:33.223 --> 00:22:37.393]  Yilt message, embarrassment message, anger message, trust in science message.
[00:22:41.377 --> 00:22:44.980]  And then the last message is, it's not brave to not wear a mask, it's stupid.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.141]  And you heard others.
[00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:48.082]  So a lot of these are combinations of the same message.
[00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:51.184]  And then the article goes through the descriptions I basically just gave you.
[00:22:51.365 --> 00:22:54.427]  But when you see these 15, you ought to print this article out.
[00:22:54.447 --> 00:22:56.628]  In fact, post this article in fullwars.com.
[00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:58.410]  People should go to gatewaypundit.com and get it as well.
[00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.731]  But post it with a link.
[00:22:59.751 --> 00:23:01.832]  Because you should hang this on your refrigerator door.
[00:23:01.872 --> 00:23:03.113]  You should have it waiting in the car.
[00:23:03.354 --> 00:23:07.597]  So when you see news headlines, you need to look at it and have a game and say, which one of these is it?
[00:23:07.717 --> 00:23:09.038]  Because it's all pre-programmed.
[00:23:11.112 --> 00:23:12.953]  You see the same message over and over again.
[00:23:13.133 --> 00:23:15.714]  Fear of the virus when it's overblown and a lie.
[00:23:16.055 --> 00:23:17.355]  Fear of hurting other people.
[00:23:17.455 --> 00:23:18.656]  Fear of others pressuring you.
[00:23:18.916 --> 00:23:19.917]  Fear of embarrassment.
[00:23:21.197 --> 00:23:26.500]  Federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials on how best to persuade Americans to take COVID-19.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.561]  Then it goes through the examples.
[00:23:28.601 --> 00:23:29.802]  When we come back, we'll read these.
[00:23:31.262 --> 00:23:32.043]  The brief summary.
[00:23:33.171 --> 00:23:35.392]  How to shame the trust in science.
[00:23:36.212 --> 00:23:37.633]  And it's all lies.
[00:23:37.653 --> 00:23:38.913]  Like, trust in Fauci?
[00:23:39.113 --> 00:23:40.554]  Oh, but other doctors can't speak.
[00:23:40.894 --> 00:23:41.574]  Other scientists.
[00:23:41.694 --> 00:23:47.777]  Only the guy involved at Wuhan, with Bill Gates, with investment in the vaccines, who says he wants to depopulate us.
[00:23:47.997 --> 00:23:50.538]  And Fauci goes to depopulation meetings.
[00:23:50.758 --> 00:23:51.838]  That's now been discovered.
[00:23:51.858 --> 00:23:52.959]  Of course he wants to kill us!
[00:23:54.219 --> 00:23:55.760]  Alright, the system being brought in.
[00:23:56.914 --> 00:24:15.186]  Is a post-human system, but before the human population is completely eradicated, the globalists say in their own white papers on record, and Jay Dyer, when he hosts, does a great job laying out, not just the old statements, but a lot of the new books and statements by the head of the Demos group and the head of
[00:24:16.411 --> 00:24:19.313]  The United Nations, biodiversity operations, UNESCO.
[00:24:20.093 --> 00:24:27.717]  When I'm telling you all this, I know it sounds fantastical, except not so much anymore because we've got a lot of examples that are well-known articles.
[00:24:27.777 --> 00:24:35.602]  Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, 1999 cover of Wired Magazine, Bill Joy again goes to that conference with a couple hundred billionaires.
[00:24:36.562 --> 00:24:43.045]  And they have the consensus that they are going to depopulate the planet because humans have become obsolete.
[00:24:43.385 --> 00:24:46.626]  So they're going to create a system to basically phase us out.
[00:24:46.786 --> 00:24:54.710]  Or a month ago, dreaming of the end of the human population.
[00:24:55.570 --> 00:25:01.433]  Or NBC a few months ago, cyborgs replace humans and remake the world, James Lovelock says.
[00:25:01.873 --> 00:25:04.194]  Then it goes on to say, by the end,
[00:25:06.317 --> 00:25:10.120]  Of this century, there will be no more humans on the earth.
[00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:13.122]  And you go, well that's just crazy.
[00:25:14.383 --> 00:25:15.504]  No, they're going to do it.
[00:25:16.485 --> 00:25:18.106]  Looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:25:18.867 --> 00:25:20.148]  This is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:20.448 --> 00:25:25.813]  And again, you're fallen, you're bad, you're not good.
[00:25:26.273 --> 00:25:27.634]  They're just going to change you.
[00:25:27.654 --> 00:25:30.016]  Just like all the major crops are GMO now.
[00:25:33.376 --> 00:25:34.617]  And they're not what they originally were.
[00:25:34.637 --> 00:25:37.978]  Oh, and in all the studies, they reduce your fertility, give you cancer, and kill you.
[00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:41.040]  Might take 20 years, but you're gonna die.
[00:25:42.061 --> 00:25:44.662]  You're gonna have irritable bowels the whole time.
[00:25:44.702 --> 00:25:47.444]  That's why Crohn's disease, almost no one had it 30 years ago.
[00:25:47.504 --> 00:25:49.144]  Now it's 1 in 50 people.
[00:25:49.805 --> 00:25:53.907]  Almost everyone has serious bowel issues because you're being murdered!
[00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:55.128]  Red rum!
[00:25:55.488 --> 00:25:56.168]  Red rum!
[00:25:58.029 --> 00:26:01.031]  And so now, I'll be in the grocery store, and it'll be like,
[00:26:03.294 --> 00:26:04.457]  A big color magazine.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.765]  What the end of humans is going to look like.
[00:26:08.666 --> 00:26:18.630]  And you pick it up, and it shows all the overgrown cities, and the earth is wonderful, and the animals are happy, and we were a parasitic species that was bad, but... And you know what's gonna be at the end of the magazine?
[00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:19.470]  Flip, flip, flip.
[00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.191]  This is the one I showed you a few years ago on air.
[00:26:21.931 --> 00:26:29.954]  It'll be cyborgs at the end that have gone off-world and become gods and left the earth for the bumblebees and the tortoises.
[00:26:30.534 --> 00:26:31.995]  And I flipped, and oh!
[00:26:32.395 --> 00:26:33.235]  It was the next page.
[00:26:33.495 --> 00:26:35.416]  Because it's a religious hymn.
[00:26:35.856 --> 00:26:37.217]  It's a religious document.
[00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:40.849]  I've read it a thousand times, literally.
[00:26:42.231 --> 00:26:56.790]  And so, I pick up Wired Magazine, I pick up Wall Street Journal, I pick up NBC News, I pick up Associated Press, I pick up a textbook for college, and I know what's gonna be in it because it's a religious hymn!
[00:26:58.086 --> 00:27:01.448]  If I go get a Mormon book, I know it's going to be in it because I've looked at it.
[00:27:01.728 --> 00:27:07.731]  If I go get a Baptist, I could be reading an article and go, this guy's a Baptist, this guy's a Southern Baptist.
[00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:12.833]  I can open up another thing and be reading an author and I go, when I go to the bio, this guy's going to be a right-wing Catholic.
[00:27:13.634 --> 00:27:14.834]  Or this guy's going to be a liberal Catholic.
[00:27:14.854 --> 00:27:16.255]  I mean, I know, I study stuff.
[00:27:17.576 --> 00:27:24.179]  But let me tell you, the dominant religion on this planet is the elites are going to transcend their bodies and become God.
[00:27:26.428 --> 00:27:29.049]  Just like the serpent said, don't you know you're a god?
[00:27:29.069 --> 00:27:30.330]  You're gonna live forever.
[00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.991]  You'll have all the knowledge of good and evil, how the whole thing works.
[00:27:34.312 --> 00:27:35.472]  Take a bite of this apple.
[00:27:36.352 --> 00:27:39.234]  And what is on the back of all the apple products?
[00:27:39.354 --> 00:27:40.434]  An apple with a bite out of it.
[00:27:40.774 --> 00:27:44.296]  What is Amazon's symbol?
[00:27:45.176 --> 00:27:47.257]  A tail with a fork on the end of it.
[00:27:48.298 --> 00:27:50.559]  They're telling you who they are.
[00:27:51.732 --> 00:27:54.073]  They're telling you, we ain't of this world, Jack.
[00:27:54.574 --> 00:27:59.256]  One tells you it's a serpent giving you an apple, another one tells you it's a devil with a forked tail!
[00:28:05.179 --> 00:28:06.200]  And so, you know what?
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:13.024]  All these people can be tricked to give up their free will and to be part of this, and they're going to create the dystopia.
[00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:15.285]  They're going to shut off the industries.
[00:28:15.305 --> 00:28:16.886]  They're going to shut off the infrastructure.
[00:28:17.688 --> 00:28:28.111]  They're going to open the borders of the third world, flood us with the third world so we all destroy each other, but they're not going to be on space stations above us like the fictitious Elysium.
[00:28:29.871 --> 00:28:36.473]  They say it's going to be compact, armored city-states that are totally surveilled, exempt from everything they do to us.
[00:28:37.093 --> 00:28:40.874]  Exempt from taxes, exempt from regulations, exempt from the GMO.
[00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:56.017]  Already in Europe and China, it's come out in the news over the years, even the Leningradian, that the rich Chinese and the Communist Party have thousands and thousands of acres outside each city of greenhouses.
[00:28:57.469 --> 00:29:07.776]  With all purified soil and everything, where they eat organic, they get clean vaccines that don't have the additives in it, because vaccines, real vaccines work.
[00:29:07.976 --> 00:29:11.138]  They can have side effects, but you can really take one and get immunity from something.
[00:29:11.578 --> 00:29:13.219]  And they've got everything for themselves.
[00:29:13.459 --> 00:29:18.182]  And that's what all this is, is the two Google founders that got all the CIA money.
[00:29:20.984 --> 00:29:24.566]  They live, both of them, on 10,000, 20,000 acre estates.
[00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:28.319]  I looked it up.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.461]  Sergey Brin and Page.
[00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:36.962]  And they've got private jumbo jets and jet helicopters and they don't talk to people.
[00:29:39.123 --> 00:29:40.924]  And that's how all these billionaires are.
[00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:41.784]  They've all got...
[00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:55.009]  Their own world, and then they've made you obsolete by using technology to build an architecture that's anti-human, that makes you alone, that makes you depressed, that makes you hateful, that makes you stupid, that makes you vulnerable.
[00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.950]  These are all their own words.
[00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.752]  And then they go, look how you're scum!
[00:29:58.992 --> 00:29:59.913]  We need to kill you!
[00:30:01.594 --> 00:30:02.875]  Just like Dutch TV.
[00:30:02.895 --> 00:30:09.299]  A couple years ago, we ought to find this, where they had a high-functioning Down syndrome man on there.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:11.941]  Nice fella.
[00:30:13.131 --> 00:30:17.914]  But you're high-end, and they're talking to him, and it's a woman and a man.
[00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:18.395]  They're laughing.
[00:30:18.415 --> 00:30:21.337]  They go, you know, you cost the state, because they made it all socialist.
[00:30:21.517 --> 00:30:23.258]  They made it where his family didn't take care of it.
[00:30:23.418 --> 00:30:25.840]  They made it where it was the state so they could make those decisions over his life.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.143]  And they looked at him and they said, you cost six times more than the average person welfare.
[00:30:29.703 --> 00:30:30.243]  How do you feel?
[00:30:30.824 --> 00:30:34.446]  He starts saying, I'm sorry, but you know, this is a society you set up.
[00:30:34.526 --> 00:30:35.447]  And they go, yeah.
[00:30:35.627 --> 00:30:37.769]  And then he kind of just decides, maybe I should kill myself.
[00:30:38.735 --> 00:30:40.156]  And they're laughing because they're liberals.
[00:30:40.176 --> 00:30:42.918]  They're like, look at you, you sack of garbage.
[00:30:44.159 --> 00:30:46.220]  But they're the liberals, so it's so sweet.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:46.961]  It's so good.
[00:30:46.981 --> 00:30:49.743]  And it's like, let's kill the old people.
[00:30:50.143 --> 00:30:52.945]  Oh, oh, let's keep the babies alive and sell their organs.
[00:30:53.265 --> 00:30:55.027]  This is a Satan cult, man.
[00:30:56.698 --> 00:31:21.918]  Empty, hateful, nobodies that mean nothing to themselves or anybody else, cut off from God, cut off from the universe, building a world where you can't have food or water unless you do what they say and carry a phone or a chip that says you've complied with all their rules, and the more you comply, the more rules there'll be, and more and more people, as it gets worse, will comply and comply and comply more and more and more.
[00:31:23.317 --> 00:31:26.019]  Thinking that it's going to get them out of the nightmare they're in.
[00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:26.479]  No, no.
[00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:37.605]  When you've got your leg in a bear trap, kissing the bear trap and petting it and talking nice to it and saying, hey, how about, how about, you know, I blow my head off.
[00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:39.206]  Will that make you like me more to the bear trap?
[00:31:39.466 --> 00:31:40.267]  It's a bear trap.
[00:31:41.928 --> 00:31:43.348]  You don't step in the bear trap.
[00:31:43.628 --> 00:31:49.572]  And if you're already in the bear trap, you got to get people that are nearby to come help you and recognize it's a bear trap and get it off your leg.
[00:31:50.948 --> 00:31:51.548]  See, we don't do that.
[00:31:51.568 --> 00:31:53.029]  We're like, no, this isn't a bear trap.
[00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.510]  We're like, it's all lies.
[00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.012]  They didn't kill the number they said.
[00:31:57.052 --> 00:31:58.313]  They count regular deaths as it.
[00:31:58.413 --> 00:32:00.094]  They'll never let us out of the lockdown.
[00:32:00.114 --> 00:32:00.974]  They're now admitting that.
[00:32:01.254 --> 00:32:06.658]  This is about a total takeover, a post-human future, where robots will have to deliver us all our food and self-driving cars.
[00:32:06.838 --> 00:32:08.319]  And that's those of us that have resources.
[00:32:08.339 --> 00:32:09.439]  And then that'll be destroyed.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.981]  And the public is going to absolute crater and go crazy.
[00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:15.503]  So they're going to roll out all these amnesia drugs, just drug everybody out.
[00:32:15.703 --> 00:32:17.725]  Then they're going to lay on the side of the street till they die.
[00:32:17.965 --> 00:32:20.006]  And then robot trucks are going to arrive and take
[00:32:20.086 --> 00:32:20.787]  Take the bodies away!
[00:32:20.967 --> 00:32:28.313]  We're not going to call it euthanasia, but we're all going to be glad that billions are going to be committing suicide by the end of the decade.
[00:32:29.574 --> 00:32:33.037]  Hundreds of millions are going to starve to death conservatively in the next few years.
[00:32:34.078 --> 00:32:37.181]  This is the end, my friends, my only friends.
[00:32:38.142 --> 00:32:40.364]  Because of their elaborate plans, the end.
[00:32:41.124 --> 00:32:41.765]  No safety!
[00:32:45.009 --> 00:32:47.310]  You're gonna pay for not standing up for the babies.
[00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.171]  You're gonna pay for wearing your mask.
[00:32:49.331 --> 00:32:50.671]  You're gonna pay for submitting.
[00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:51.992]  You're gonna pay hard.
[00:32:52.952 --> 00:32:56.753]  And it's gonna get so bad, you're gonna finally figure out you better stop obeying.
[00:32:56.973 --> 00:33:04.656]  But then you'll be so domesticated, and everybody else will be whacked out of their brain, that you won't have any fate but to go ahead and take the pill and kill yourself.
[00:33:05.617 --> 00:33:06.537]  Now that's where you're going.
[00:33:07.077 --> 00:33:09.018]  And remember, Bill Gates loves it.
[00:33:09.538 --> 00:33:14.080]  Alright, I know I just repeated a lot of information that I've said a hundred times here on air, and I've made films about
[00:33:15.663 --> 00:33:17.544]  Because it's who rules the earth.
[00:33:17.664 --> 00:33:18.704]  It's the main religion.
[00:33:19.204 --> 00:33:20.644]  It is the system of Satan.
[00:33:22.985 --> 00:33:24.386]  None of these globalists are atheists.
[00:33:24.886 --> 00:33:26.106]  I told you that 20 years ago.
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:38.650]  Now it's come out that they believe they're going to be gods, and they believe they're getting off-world, interdimensional inspiration for what they're building and what they're constructing against us.
[00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.111]  But really, they're just using technologies we developed that would empower us
[00:33:43.243 --> 00:33:44.544]  And twisting it for control.
[00:33:44.724 --> 00:33:48.946]  So let me tell you the key to the entire thing right now, temporarily.
[00:33:50.947 --> 00:33:52.889]  Why they're abolishing the police, and they will.
[00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.891]  Why they're going to abolish the human military, and they will.
[00:33:57.611 --> 00:34:00.213]  Why they're abolishing the family, and they will if they have their way.
[00:34:00.973 --> 00:34:04.055]  Why they're abolishing the nation state, because it's human.
[00:34:07.441 --> 00:34:11.507]  And our whole experience is about fighting with other humans.
[00:34:12.388 --> 00:34:14.291]  So of course the police do some things that are wrong.
[00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:19.018]  Of course we get mad at government and bureaucracies and it's not perfect and it's got problems.
[00:34:20.734 --> 00:34:36.900]  And so if you've got an evil, anti-human, globalist faction getting control, and there's a global awakening to them at the national level, you then direct that anger and the awakening at the human government itself, at the local government itself.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:43.642]  Because if you start thinking about the globalists and the New World Order as aliens that want to kill you, you'll be in the right mindset.
[00:34:45.094 --> 00:34:47.256]  And notice the media doesn't make jokes about this.
[00:34:47.536 --> 00:34:48.537]  They don't attack me for this.
[00:34:48.597 --> 00:34:49.918]  They don't want this touched.
[00:34:49.978 --> 00:34:50.718]  They want me off air.
[00:34:51.319 --> 00:34:53.600]  But it's not aliens in a flying saucer, folks.
[00:34:53.941 --> 00:34:54.801]  It's interdimensional.
[00:34:55.582 --> 00:34:56.403]  That's what it is.
[00:34:58.084 --> 00:35:00.866]  I was on Joe Rogan a year and a half ago.
[00:35:02.607 --> 00:35:06.070]  And as soon as he gets to where he's going in Texas, things are going to happen.
[00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:06.670]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.612]  Talked to him quite a bit last night.
[00:35:10.592 --> 00:35:27.286]  And I'm telling him that since the 70s, they have been in government-funded programs in San Francisco and other areas, putting people on DMT drips and other drugs to go map, like astronauts, these other dimensions and have communications with these entities.
[00:35:28.608 --> 00:35:31.090]  You'd call it a poltergeist or whatever, but that's not what it is.
[00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.853]  And then they give them impetus and ideas, but then they ask for things.
[00:35:36.574 --> 00:35:38.256]  And a lot of times they ask for blood.
[00:35:40.646 --> 00:35:41.227]  A sacrifice.
[00:35:41.487 --> 00:35:44.732]  Why do you think every culture takes drugs and then starts killing their own kids?
[00:35:44.972 --> 00:35:52.763]  Because these things will tell you stuff, but they're so low-level and so evil, they're just really old, that we're like babies.
[00:35:55.034 --> 00:36:05.986]  And then a few months later he had a big professor on going, the first open trials in Japan, England, the US at the beginning, at these universities and we are actually like astronauts going in and mapping with the DMT.
[00:36:06.267 --> 00:36:11.693]  We can stay in the DMT state for up to 12 hours and we're communicating with the entities and mapping it all.
[00:36:12.133 --> 00:36:13.935]  They were doing it in the 70s!
[00:36:14.055 --> 00:36:15.417]  That's what I know about!
[00:36:18.097 --> 00:36:30.436]  Because I happen to be sitting in the back of a Volkswagen on a cross-country drive with my mom and her friend who was involved in it in San Francisco and then later one time at dinner when I was not even 10 years old hearing them talk about this.
[00:36:30.636 --> 00:36:31.557]  My mom wasn't involved.
[00:36:33.561 --> 00:36:50.832]  I remember later asking her about it, she says, oh yeah, the 70s and all that, you know, Mescalito, and the little spirit guides, the little devils, and that's what all these Illuminati globalists talk about, is these spirit guides that do have little horns, and they look like little goats, and that's why they wear little green hats that look like elves, because they don't want to scare you.
[00:36:51.312 --> 00:36:54.194]  Sometimes they wear little masks, because they take the mask off, got little vampire teeth.
[00:36:54.594 --> 00:36:57.056]  I mean, this is what they're, this is what they're communicating with.
[00:36:57.076 --> 00:37:01.639]  Why do you think every culture says, there's these demons right out of view behind the veil?
[00:37:02.585 --> 00:37:03.085]  It's demons.
[00:37:03.205 --> 00:37:04.226]  It's aliens, is what it is.
[00:37:04.746 --> 00:37:05.006]  Okay?
[00:37:06.066 --> 00:37:09.527]  And as soon as you realize all that, it all makes perfect sense.
[00:37:09.608 --> 00:37:12.208]  Why they're into devil worship, hurting kids, drinking blood.
[00:37:12.509 --> 00:37:19.691]  Why the Aztecs, and the ancient Babylonians, and the Egyptians, and the Africans all did it, and all the Europeans did it, and in Asia they did it.
[00:37:19.991 --> 00:37:30.275]  They would lead children up to entities and butcher their children and spill blood while taking hallucinogens to be able to interface with the entity.
[00:37:32.403 --> 00:37:40.467]  And finally, Abraham comes along and God says, you don't have to kill your kids anymore for sacrifice, just stop that.
[00:37:41.327 --> 00:37:42.388]  A ram will suffice.
[00:37:42.408 --> 00:37:55.273]  Because God didn't want the blood, God was just like, the angel was just like, you can stop, I don't want blood, I'm not with those guys.
[00:37:57.577 --> 00:37:59.358]  That's where this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:59.758 --> 00:38:00.539]  And that's where we are.
[00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:01.659]  That's why they want your children.
[00:38:01.699 --> 00:38:02.540]  It's why they want wars.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.361]  It's why they want death, because they want the dark energy.
[00:38:07.642 --> 00:38:16.627]  And once you realize that that's what Bill Gates serves, and that's what Ted Turner serves, and that's what Jeffrey Epstein serves, and you just look at Hillary Clinton, totally demon possessed.
[00:38:17.907 --> 00:38:18.708]  She's at the cocktail parties.
[00:38:18.868 --> 00:38:19.708]  Hi, everybody!
[00:38:19.808 --> 00:38:20.309]  I'm Hillary!
[00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:26.532]  I mean, she ought to be flying a damn broom, because it's in her.
[00:38:32.918 --> 00:38:37.701]  And I just so happened to run into Rich Satanist when I was in junior high and high school in Dallas.
[00:38:40.323 --> 00:38:41.864]  And I just so happened to have a view into that.
[00:38:43.344 --> 00:38:47.987]  And so my whole life's been training to understand what repugnance felt, and I wouldn't know this from a book.
[00:38:48.608 --> 00:38:55.432]  I know this from experience and the things I saw over and over again, and the veil that the public is living behind.
[00:38:58.959 --> 00:39:03.181]  And so now Bill Gates is telling you, you're all gonna get sick when you take his shot.
[00:39:04.802 --> 00:39:07.024]  But you gotta take it to ever have a job or leave your house.
[00:39:07.364 --> 00:39:14.408]  That's where they're now going in Australia and in Spain, where they think they've got control of the populations.
[00:39:14.828 --> 00:39:16.649]  They're saying vaccines are months out.
[00:39:16.949 --> 00:39:20.451]  You're gonna have to have a digital ID on your phone or a chip to do it.
[00:39:22.533 --> 00:39:26.295]  And Bill Gates has publicly announced that you don't have a choice.
[00:39:27.509 --> 00:39:36.952]  It only returns, quote, semi-normalcy when you take what he wants to put in your body that reprograms your cells and makes you not human.
[00:39:38.493 --> 00:39:41.053]  They are triggering a mutation in us.
[00:39:41.353 --> 00:39:46.255]  Do you think Bill Gates just pulled this out of a cabbage patch he was walking by?
[00:39:46.275 --> 00:39:49.876]  No.
[00:39:49.956 --> 00:39:54.998]  Francis Galton, Charles Darwin,
[00:39:56.178 --> 00:40:05.343]  and others were all black magicians that took hallucinogens, this is actually on record to be researched deeply, to interface with this and come up with a plan.
[00:40:05.423 --> 00:40:06.383]  And they came up with the whole plan.
[00:40:07.904 --> 00:40:12.406]  Eugenics, genetic engineering, I mean, they're already new folks.
[00:40:13.927 --> 00:40:19.530]  You know how old the Sumerian symbol of two snakes together with a strand down the middle?
[00:40:20.947 --> 00:40:26.160]  And the Sumerians say that creatures came from another star and showed them how we work and explain this to them.
[00:40:28.358 --> 00:40:33.422]  And so the British scientists all knew this, but they knew to really get the knowledge, they had to take huge amounts of drugs.
[00:40:34.102 --> 00:40:40.406]  They had to interbreed with their most elite families to get their genetics tuned for psychics that were able to interface with these things.
[00:40:41.047 --> 00:40:51.253]  And then they got alien technology through intergalactic space-time communications to build a gate or something here on Earth to bring them in.
[00:40:51.273 --> 00:40:54.876]  And the Bible says in the end times, the gates of hell will open.
[00:40:55.256 --> 00:40:56.577]  Hell will open!
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.881]  And we will be invaded, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:03.242 --> 00:41:13.307]  Now there's Sumerian, 6,000 year old, 5,000 year old symbol of modern medicine, the double helix of DNA.
[00:41:17.789 --> 00:41:20.250]  And you've got the little angels with the halos, see them?
[00:41:21.331 --> 00:41:22.591]  The reptoids that can fly?
[00:41:24.352 --> 00:41:25.833]  Right there for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:26.933 --> 00:41:27.814]  And that's what it is.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:39.382]  Can you imagine ancient humans whacked out of their minds and the priest comes to the tribe and says, listen, we got to kill one of the kids.
[00:41:40.383 --> 00:41:43.643]  It's going to give us even more knowledge about planting crops and about the stars.
[00:41:43.683 --> 00:41:45.424]  We got to have this for the tribe.
[00:41:45.804 --> 00:41:47.424]  Who's going to step up and give us one of your children?
[00:41:48.685 --> 00:41:52.886]  And they say, okay, I guess you can kill my son and kill my daughter.
[00:41:54.026 --> 00:41:57.067]  And they'd leave that child right up there and just gut their ass.
[00:41:57.907 --> 00:41:59.628]  And then the demon would say, here's the knowledge.
[00:42:01.257 --> 00:42:04.498]  But then it's more and more and more of the children.
[00:42:04.718 --> 00:42:08.419]  They need more, more, more, more, more, more.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:16.301]  When really, they're just training us to kill our children and turning us around species to get a little knowledge.
[00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:21.162]  But then the knowledge they give us is the knowledge to build a kill grid that's going to destroy us all.
[00:42:23.603 --> 00:42:24.523]  So that's even a scam.
[00:42:24.563 --> 00:42:26.364]  Who knows if they even want the blood?
[00:42:27.184 --> 00:42:28.824]  Who knows if they even want the virgins?
[00:42:29.585 --> 00:42:30.485]  Which just means a child.
[00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:37.243]  They're just training us like a dog to eat our own babies, and then they give us a treat!
[00:42:39.004 --> 00:42:39.584]  Well, guess what?
[00:42:39.624 --> 00:42:46.768]  I'm not a dog, and I'm not here part of this crap, and I don't like you devil worshippers, and I don't like people that are under its control.
[00:42:47.028 --> 00:42:49.970]  They feel weak, they feel cold, they feel scared.
[00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.391]  They're not connected to God.
[00:42:53.412 --> 00:42:59.295]  But God is gonna give us a choice, and if we want to join with the broadcast, that's what it is, a broadcast, a spirit.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.062]  You know, you go to a pep rally, you feel the spirit.
[00:43:02.082 --> 00:43:03.162]  You go to a rock concert, you feel the spirit.
[00:43:03.383 --> 00:43:04.423]  You go to church, you feel the spirit.
[00:43:04.684 --> 00:43:08.106]  You know, it's a party, everybody's having a great time, you feel the vibe.
[00:43:08.187 --> 00:43:08.887]  That's the spirit.
[00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:09.968]  It's a broadcast.
[00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:14.492]  And I'm not giving my kids to some winged serpent that wants to eat them.
[00:43:15.132 --> 00:43:17.054]  What's Clotlipotle, or whatever the hell you call it.
[00:43:19.836 --> 00:43:20.356]  It's a joke.
[00:43:20.376 --> 00:43:22.078]  It's sick.
[00:43:22.398 --> 00:43:24.760]  And every culture gave their children to that snake.
[00:43:26.381 --> 00:43:27.942]  And now it's the modern science.
[00:43:29.178 --> 00:43:30.579]  It's the symbol of our DNA.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.744]  And it just so happens to be what our DNA looks like, minus the snake.
[00:43:35.464 --> 00:43:36.566]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:41.491]  Artificial systems have been created to inject into your body and mutate your cells.
[00:43:42.532 --> 00:43:45.014]  A corporate takeover of your very DNA.
[00:43:46.496 --> 00:43:51.381]  Meanwhile, all across Europe and in the Pacific and Australia,
[00:43:52.998 --> 00:43:57.887]  They are now surrounding apartment complexes, not letting anyone out for six weeks so far.
[00:43:58.709 --> 00:44:02.255]  Anyone trying to leave is arrested and now they're going and preparing them for forced inoculations.
[00:44:02.596 --> 00:44:05.461]  Here's the news report, White Washington from Melbourne, Australia.
[00:44:07.409 --> 00:44:10.853]  Their last moments of freedom before the curfew came into effect.
[00:44:11.513 --> 00:44:14.016]  The new measures are the country's strictest to date.
[00:44:14.677 --> 00:44:20.302]  Melbourne is already under a six-week lockdown, but the infection numbers are still rising.
[00:44:20.843 --> 00:44:24.146]  Victoria's premier has now declared a state of disaster.
[00:44:25.369 --> 00:44:28.150]  We can no longer have people visiting others.
[00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:31.291]  We can no longer have people simply out and about.
[00:44:31.311 --> 00:44:33.412]  By the way, almost no deaths.
[00:44:33.732 --> 00:44:34.172]  All a hoax.
[00:44:34.192 --> 00:44:35.873]  It is not an easy decision to make.
[00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:36.373]  Martial law.
[00:44:36.413 --> 00:44:39.334]  But it is a decision that is necessary and that is why I have made it.
[00:44:39.354 --> 00:44:40.935]  Safe for life.
[00:44:40.955 --> 00:44:41.495]  We've got to do it.
[00:44:41.515 --> 00:44:42.615]  The police will be out in force.
[00:44:42.655 --> 00:44:43.115]  Fake testing.
[00:44:43.135 --> 00:44:50.638]  You will be stopped and you will be asked and you will need to demonstrate that you are lawfully out and that you are not breaching that curfew.
[00:44:51.576 --> 00:44:54.999]  The Premier said people are not taking the virus seriously enough.
[00:44:55.579 --> 00:45:01.844]  Officials reported that one quarter of those who recently tested positive had violated lockdown rules.
[00:45:01.884 --> 00:45:02.665]  And they're not dying.
[00:45:02.685 --> 00:45:03.405]  They know it's a fraud.
[00:45:03.726 --> 00:45:07.829]  Authorities now have greater powers over Melbourne's five million residents.
[00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:11.452]  Additional restrictions for workplaces are to be announced.
[00:45:11.472 --> 00:45:13.653]  By the way, they're bringing in people that aren't Australian to be the police.
[00:45:13.773 --> 00:45:16.456]  They're bringing them in from China, where they're very happy to take over.
[00:45:18.166 --> 00:45:20.529]  For more on this story, I'm joined by Andre Leslie.
[00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:23.313]  He's a journalist with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Sydney.
[00:45:23.333 --> 00:45:23.974]  Well, they're all at home.
[00:45:24.014 --> 00:45:24.695]  It's all part of the hoax.
[00:45:24.715 --> 00:45:29.821]  Andre, why has Melbourne in particular been so badly affected when compared with the rest of the country?
[00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:30.923]  Stop it, you lying monster!
[00:45:32.355 --> 00:45:40.462]  Rebecca, I think it's pretty generally acknowledged that it's got something to do with some of these early outbreak cases around the quarantine hotels.
[00:45:40.922 --> 00:45:51.632]  As people were coming back into Australia after COVID-19 broke out around the world, Australia was able to control the outbreaks here pretty well, I think, as maybe some viewers know.
[00:45:52.072 --> 00:46:00.059]  But what happened in the quarantine hotels in Victoria was that private security firms were used to look after people in those hotels.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:06.344]  Standards weren't maintained and from there COVID-19 went out into the community.
[00:46:06.985 --> 00:46:15.992]  It then spread into some public housing estates in northern Melbourne which are a little bit more prevalent in those parts of Australia's second biggest city.
[00:46:16.537 --> 00:46:19.440]  And then there was a big problem with family gatherings as well.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:26.325]  So those three factors seem to play a particular role in Victoria, which didn't happen in other states.
[00:46:26.505 --> 00:46:39.936]  Now, the Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews, says people have been going to work too much over the last couple of weeks when they should have known better, when they were either feeling slightly unwell or they were in close contact with someone with coronavirus.
[00:46:40.417 --> 00:46:44.160]  So a little bit of now, a shifting of personal blame onto people as well.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.441]  OK, now this is, of course, a second lockdown.
[00:46:48.041 --> 00:46:51.582]  Australia was in an initial lockdown when most of the rest of the world also was.
[00:46:51.922 --> 00:46:57.644]  Now this is an even more tightening of the restrictions from the first and an extension of that lockdown.
[00:46:57.664 --> 00:47:00.665]  Now, can the economy cope with this extension?
[00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:05.506]  Well, you'd expect that the night-time economy won't be able to cope.
[00:47:05.766 --> 00:47:12.829]  In Victoria, in Melbourne, they're shutting down from 8pm till 5am every night, which they're going to do now for six weeks.
[00:47:12.889 --> 00:47:14.109]  I think they'll be very affected.
[00:47:14.602 --> 00:47:17.445]  I think restaurants and things like that will struggle.
[00:47:17.505 --> 00:47:20.707]  They'll probably do some takeaway and those sorts of things.
[00:47:20.787 --> 00:47:26.953]  Cafes, a big part of Melbourne life, will probably shut down in many parts.
[00:47:27.413 --> 00:47:41.586]  Supermarkets and basic services will continue but the question for many Victorians is what sort of business will be deemed essential and I think that's getting reviewed over the next 48 hours so they can give some clarity to people as to whether they can keep their business running or not.
[00:47:42.682 --> 00:47:47.906]  Alright, journalist Andre Leslie in Sydney, thanks very much for the update.
[00:47:47.926 --> 00:48:04.539]  So ladies and gentlemen, remember we told you once you accept the first lockdown, they let it off a little and then squeeze you even tighter again, until again you totally submit and take the forced inoculation, the digital tracker in your phone, and if you really want to be cool, the chip under the skin.
[00:48:05.953 --> 00:48:11.815]  A lot of the new vaccines they're coming out with will actually have the little nanotech in it, so it's like, oh, we scanned you, it says it's in you.
[00:48:11.835 --> 00:48:15.337]  This is all part of the artificial corporate takeover of your body.
[00:48:16.377 --> 00:48:17.698]  This is all part of your sterilization.
[00:48:18.538 --> 00:48:21.199]  That's why we're being given liability protection in this whole thing.
[00:48:21.639 --> 00:48:23.140]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.601]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:48:25.621 --> 00:48:33.344]  All right, last hour I really got into what makes the world turn and the spiritual fight we're under.
[00:48:34.386 --> 00:48:36.428]  That everybody now sees is real.
[00:48:37.629 --> 00:48:42.012]  But I want to hit something really important here before I give the number out and take calls in the next few hours.
[00:48:43.273 --> 00:48:44.094]  For the next few hours.
[00:48:44.654 --> 00:48:50.579]  And it's that you see them saying churches are non-essential, family gatherings are bad.
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:56.864]  Anything traditional, anything pro-human, anything where we come together is bad for the greater good.
[00:48:56.984 --> 00:49:01.447]  But if it's to abolish the police department, if it's to open the borders up,
[00:49:02.655 --> 00:49:11.922]  If it's to kill white people, well then, whether it's in England, or whether it's in Australia, or whether it's in the United States, or Canada, or Germany, then it's a good thing.
[00:49:12.523 --> 00:49:20.249]  Oh, we need to bring in unlimited migrants, even though supposedly all of them have COVID, or 70% have it, because they've all had the flu or a cold the last 10 years.
[00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:22.050]  Again, that's all a hoax admitted.
[00:49:22.811 --> 00:49:28.395]  Medical doctors try to come out, expose it, they get banned, but not Dr. Gates.
[00:49:29.755 --> 00:49:30.636]  Because he's not a doctor.
[00:49:31.236 --> 00:49:35.139]  He's a globalist front man for the cartel, the anti-human cartel.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.983]  So when you see them doing things like this, you have to understand, they're coming in.
[00:49:41.103 --> 00:49:42.864]  Soros didn't spend of U.S.
[00:49:42.884 --> 00:49:49.589]  taxpayer money, that's where he really got it all, through the State Department, through Obama and the Clinton era and Bush era deals.
[00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:57.274]  He didn't spend billions of dollars overthrowing Ukraine to then just let it go back to the control of the people.
[00:49:57.635 --> 00:49:59.376]  They didn't spend billions of dollars
[00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:14.798]  Electing over 500 county attorneys and circuit court attorneys like Kim Gardner in St.
[00:50:14.838 --> 00:50:29.368]  Louis, or the new district attorney in Austin who actually praises Soros, got $600,000 from him, and actually says they're going to abolish the police, and that white people are bad.
[00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:33.511]  He's a Hispanic extremist.
[00:50:34.465 --> 00:50:57.094]  Well, of course, if you've got the third world you control, you control the UN, you control the migration routes, you fill brown people full of hate of whites, you bring them in with a political motion, you abolish the police and then take it back over yourself and make it all race-based, and then take the wealth away from the middle class by branding it white, even though the top nine slots in the U.S.
[00:50:57.114 --> 00:50:58.815]  for wealth are Asian groups.
[00:51:00.802 --> 00:51:04.443]  Chinese, South Korean, Indian, the list goes on and on.
[00:51:04.923 --> 00:51:16.666]  White people don't even show up on the list till after Muslims, Arabs, look it up, who are also counted as Asian.
[00:51:16.686 --> 00:51:17.167]  Did you know that?
[00:51:17.187 --> 00:51:18.247]  An Arab is counted as Asian.
[00:51:19.206 --> 00:51:21.086]  Because it's a kind of crossroads of the planet.
[00:51:21.207 --> 00:51:24.627]  African, Caucasian, and Asian is really what an Arab is.
[00:51:25.948 --> 00:51:28.188]  Some more white, some more black, some more Asian.
[00:51:28.428 --> 00:51:31.949]  We have all the variations, but they're listed as Asian.
[00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:36.250]  So down here on the totem pole, there's nine groups above the evil devil white.
[00:51:37.771 --> 00:51:40.711]  When you're talking about general wealth of the general average person.
[00:51:40.751 --> 00:51:42.632]  Now the billionaires are mainly white.
[00:51:44.699 --> 00:51:49.002]  Some could be German, some Jewish, some, there's some Asian, you know, a lot of Asian billionaires as well.
[00:51:49.623 --> 00:51:54.346]  There's a few African billionaires, but they're all part of the global cabal that's anti-human.
[00:51:55.307 --> 00:52:01.551]  So they're teaching us all to hate each other, want to kill each other over resources, when there's an evil anti-human force directing it all.
[00:52:01.772 --> 00:52:10.598]  But still, if you're a black guy and the super rare event, you're in some town and the KKK does something to you, it's still racist whites coming after you.
[00:52:10.898 --> 00:52:12.880]  If you're a white person in the incredibly common,
[00:52:18.018 --> 00:52:26.141]  If you're a white person and the incredibly common event that a black person attacks you because you're white, those statistics are then covered up.
[00:52:28.582 --> 00:52:37.746]  Because again, that's part of the power play with the globalist deep state, because they've got six and a half plus billion people that aren't white.
[00:52:38.126 --> 00:52:45.229]  And so if you just simply convince them to hate white people, you can have them pull down the first world and then no one has a chance of getting out of any of this.
[00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:54.564]  And now Instagram has a mute white people button appearing on Instagram stories saying we don't want to hear from white people.
[00:52:54.904 --> 00:52:56.245]  White people don't have a right to speech.
[00:52:57.927 --> 00:53:04.053]  You can pull up the article about Instagram bans post showing black on white crime statistics.
[00:53:07.156 --> 00:53:08.597]  And now universities are having
[00:53:09.651 --> 00:53:15.354]  Major classes that are mandatory about extinguishing whiteness and how whiteness is a bad thing.
[00:53:15.394 --> 00:53:18.735]  Imagine we're having classes about being black being bad.
[00:53:21.256 --> 00:53:25.698]  So that's what this is, is a globalist anti-human system.
[00:53:26.639 --> 00:53:29.100]  And we in the West decided to try to end slavery.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:32.741]  We in the West decided to have a renaissance and a Christian ethos to build up humanity.
[00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:36.523]  They use our openness and our goodness to tell us we're not perfect.
[00:53:37.492 --> 00:53:47.054]  So we project then onto the third world that they're better than us and they're good people when they're just as tribal and just as racist or more so than white people have ever been.
[00:53:47.314 --> 00:53:48.754]  And it's total naivete.
[00:53:49.074 --> 00:54:02.377]  But the whites have been trained to politically bow down to the globalists and politically do whatever they say so they don't get called the mean name when the very country and system that is empowering the world for human freedom is being destroyed.
[00:54:05.486 --> 00:54:09.810]  There's the article, Infowars.com, Instagram censors FBI crime stats graph as hate speech.
[00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:10.250]  Show it to them.
[00:54:11.131 --> 00:54:11.592]  Blow that up.
[00:54:11.612 --> 00:54:12.292]  Scroll down, please.
[00:54:13.614 --> 00:54:15.876]  There's what Black Lives Matter is talking about.
[00:54:19.499 --> 00:54:21.941]  Right there, you have whites killed by blacks, 9.83%.
[00:54:21.982 --> 00:54:22.622]  Blacks killed by whites, 0.77%.
[00:54:29.974 --> 00:54:32.715]  That's more than 10 times, that number's two years old.
[00:54:33.015 --> 00:54:40.158]  Now the numbers are 12 times more likely to be killed by a black person if you're white than if you're a black person killed by a white.
[00:54:40.898 --> 00:54:42.198]  Whites killed by whites, 10.22.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.181]  Higher number than blacks killing whites.
[00:54:50.901 --> 00:54:52.962]  Just like you've got blacks killing blacks.
[00:54:52.982 --> 00:54:53.742]  Let's show that number.
[00:54:54.583 --> 00:54:55.183]  Go back up, please.
[00:54:56.254 --> 00:54:59.136]  You've got blacks killed by blacks, 53.94.
[00:55:03.539 --> 00:55:09.743]  You've got five times black people being killed by black people than white people killing black people.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.020]  So that's what Black Lives Matter is talking about.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:31.765]  Black Lives Matter is about owning blacks and representing blacks and saying that George Soros, a Nazi collaborator, New World Order demon, is a black man, so you can't criticize his agenda or you're anti-black when it's the Democratic Party literally created to keep slavery going.
[00:55:31.925 --> 00:55:34.325]  The Republicans tried to end it when the country was started.
[00:55:35.066 --> 00:55:37.446]  And they did end it with a damn civil war!
[00:55:37.746 --> 00:55:40.687]  But in Upside-Down Land, it's the Republicans
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.225]  Because they don't want reparations for slavery that don't like black people.
[00:55:46.506 --> 00:55:48.088]  And you're never going to get those reparations.
[00:55:48.329 --> 00:55:55.020]  If they ever have them, the bureaucrats are going to steal 99% of the money and give you a token of it with a bunch of controls over you.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.482]  Why do you think the Supreme Court ruled?
[00:55:57.824 --> 00:56:07.166]  But half of Oklahoma belongs to Native Americans because there's going to be a consortium of lawyers that come in and take control of half the state now and steal all the money and break the state apart.
[00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:13.448]  And it's a model for the rest of the country because the globalists already have 80% of the West under federal U.N.
[00:56:13.488 --> 00:56:13.948]  control.
[00:56:14.488 --> 00:56:24.411]  And now they're going to go into all the old areas where Native Americans sold off their interests or had it taken away and claim you've got a right to it so they can break up what's left of the country.
[00:56:25.071 --> 00:56:27.654]  With reparations for Native Americans, which they'll never get.
[00:56:27.974 --> 00:56:33.659]  Boy, all that money for Native Americans, but you notice, they're the poorest people out there.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:41.247]  Even though per capita, they're getting more money than anybody out there, because it's all being siphoned off, it's all being made to keep them under their globalist control.
[00:56:44.042 --> 00:56:45.103]  I want to talk about all this.
[00:56:45.123 --> 00:56:46.544]  I want to take your phone calls.
[00:56:46.644 --> 00:56:49.026]  First-time callers, your chance to get involved.
[00:56:49.046 --> 00:56:49.526]  877-789-2539.
[00:56:49.546 --> 00:56:49.846]  877-789-2539.
[00:56:50.186 --> 00:57:03.156]  Any topic you want to discuss, you want to attack me, you want to agree with me, you want to ask a question, you got a statement you want to make, this is raw and unfiltered, baby.
[00:57:03.576 --> 00:57:05.517]  The New York Times says our callers are fake.
[00:57:05.757 --> 00:57:07.619]  Dial the number and find out they're liars.
[00:57:07.639 --> 00:57:07.679]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:07.699 --> 00:57:08.079]  877-789-Alex.
[00:57:17.301 --> 00:57:19.121]  What does Trump need to do in the next 91 days?
[00:57:19.281 --> 00:57:21.442]  What's the globalist next crisis they're going to create?
[00:57:21.462 --> 00:57:23.723]  I'll tell you when we come back, the biggest news of the day.
[00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:28.544]  We're fighting for the human future.
[00:57:29.644 --> 00:57:30.404]  I know we're going to win.
[00:57:30.484 --> 00:57:34.225]  The question is, how bad's it got to get till people really wake up and understand this is the real deal.
[00:57:34.905 --> 00:57:35.745]  And I'm completely real.
[00:57:36.966 --> 00:57:39.646]  I'm completely obsessed with your future because it's part of my future.
[00:57:40.106 --> 00:57:45.868]  And I'm not laying down to people that want me to roll over to die and want me to kill you just because of what color you are.
[00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:52.656]  But if they can trick you to come at me because of what color I am, I'll defend myself and I'll be sad when I gotta put your ass down.
[00:57:53.317 --> 00:57:59.082]  But I'd rather come together and defeat this satanic attack on the planet, which you can all feel and see!
[00:57:59.523 --> 00:58:01.705]  Join humanity in a pro-human future!
[00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:03.126]  Defeat the serpent!
[00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:05.609]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:58:05.629 --> 00:58:08.372]  We're talking about the pro-human future and the globalist onslaught.
[00:58:10.475 --> 00:58:13.558]  And again, people have to realize they're in trouble.
[00:58:13.598 --> 00:58:19.403]  They have to realize we're under the control of abusers, a giant corporate takeover of liars.
[00:58:20.023 --> 00:58:23.306]  And the more we submit, the tighter the noose is going to get around our neck.
[00:58:24.027 --> 00:58:29.131]  And they had to have all this censorship of everybody ahead of time before they launched these operations.
[00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:35.957]  They didn't just launch Lockstep and Event 201 and the COVID attack because of Trump.
[00:58:37.162 --> 00:58:54.654]  They had it on the drawing board 11 years ago and the Rockefeller Foundation, the Dabos Group, all of them bragged, we're going to use a bio attack or a simulated attack to bring in planetary control through the health service of the WHO.
[00:58:56.275 --> 00:58:57.515]  The Club of Rome wrote about that in 1965.
[00:58:57.656 --> 00:59:04.020]  And the different documents they put out for limits to growth and
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.061]  Other things that were then adopted by the United Nations.
[00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:14.284]  And so, I used to read these fantastical statements on air by these people and people said, that can't be true.
[00:59:16.004 --> 00:59:27.509]  Just like when we come out and we go, hey, the official UN website says they're going to bring 600 plus million people by 2050 into the United States and that whiteness must be ended.
[00:59:28.524 --> 00:59:38.371]  Because whites are bad, and that this will create a global utopia, and they want 200 plus million in France alone, because white French are bad, and the new identity of France is black.
[00:59:39.271 --> 00:59:40.972]  That's a real statement.
[00:59:42.874 --> 00:59:45.755]  Not just in the UN document, but last year by Macron.
[00:59:46.936 --> 00:59:51.019]  You could type in, Macron says, France's destiny is African.
[00:59:51.459 --> 00:59:53.781]  He wants 230 million or whatever the number was.
[00:59:56.015 --> 01:00:01.297]  Now obviously any African that's got their head screwed on straight or any white person knows they don't like Africans.
[01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:05.459]  They're not, oh we're, oh France is going to be black, oh yeah right.
[01:00:06.799 --> 01:00:15.103]  They're going to flood everything to break society down and create a war to destroy human civilization because the globalists are at war with human civilization.
[01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:22.846]  The lockdowns, the Federal Reserve head is in the news going, if we don't lock things down it's going to hurt the economy.
[01:00:23.066 --> 01:00:24.987]  All the numbers show that kills the economy.
[01:00:27.253 --> 01:00:29.514]  Again, if we don't shoot you in the head, you might die.
[01:00:29.534 --> 01:00:33.136]  If we don't cut your finger off, you might bleed.
[01:00:33.156 --> 01:00:38.279]  If we don't pour acid in your eyeballs, Drano, you might have an eye problem.
[01:00:38.479 --> 01:00:42.081]  We're gonna gouge your eyeballs out with ice picks so you get better vision.
[01:00:42.441 --> 01:00:46.143]  You're like, we need to shut down the economy for the economy right now.
[01:00:46.323 --> 01:00:47.544]  That's Associated Press today.
[01:00:48.541 --> 01:00:55.565]  You're like, why are they, because they're just getting you used to just dis-info, so you become learned, helpless, and just give up and roll over.
[01:00:55.965 --> 01:00:56.525]  No, no, no.
[01:00:57.206 --> 01:01:00.227]  They know though a certain percent goes wild.
[01:01:02.148 --> 01:01:03.329]  And that's what's happened to us.
[01:01:06.651 --> 01:01:10.873]  So, I want to go to your phone call starting next segment at 877-789-ALEX.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.781]  But this is such an incredible time to be alive.
[01:01:15.901 --> 01:01:21.183]  They're trying to create a revolution because they know there's a revolution against their anti-human globalist plan.
[01:01:23.604 --> 01:01:39.331]  And so they're trying to create it against local government, but it's the mayors and the city council people in the blue cities, like Minneapolis and New York and Miami and Portland and Seattle and LA and San Francisco,
[01:01:40.506 --> 01:01:52.456]  That are electing the sons of famous weatherman bombers, and who are saying, we won't arrest anybody of their brown, even committing armed robbery.
[01:01:54.718 --> 01:02:03.345]  I don't care if you're black or brown or whatever, white, if you get arrested for armed robbery, but they're saying, we the communists, we the globalists, get the Pelosi clip ready please.
[01:02:04.195 --> 01:02:06.456]  Or she said, it's all collateral damage.
[01:02:06.896 --> 01:02:08.356]  She said, we have to take care of our group.
[01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:11.297]  That's her ruling elite, not even her minions, who they hate.
[01:02:12.818 --> 01:02:14.418]  And everybody else has just got to pay.
[01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:19.059]  That is such a systematically evil statement.
[01:02:19.099 --> 01:02:22.581]  But when you pull back from it and realize that's who they are, they're just being honest.
[01:02:22.641 --> 01:02:23.921]  They're uncloaking.
[01:02:26.499 --> 01:02:44.345]  And then it's the Democratic Party and all these weird, old, racist white people like Joe Biden that helped pass the laws, helped write the laws with Hillary, saying black men are like wild dogs, feral super predators that must be kept to heal.
[01:02:44.385 --> 01:02:50.608]  Imagine if I said, black men need a chain around their neck like a dog that I keep healing right there at my knee.
[01:02:52.488 --> 01:02:53.429]  Hey, I don't believe that.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:00.505]  B, I would, you know, say that, but C, if I did, my life would be over, my career would be over.
[01:03:00.825 --> 01:03:09.312]  But when Joe Biden or Hillary does it, oh, or when Margaret Sanger says blacks are subhuman, we gotta kill them all, it's oh, oh, please, oh, we love you so much!
[01:03:11.474 --> 01:03:16.979]  Just like Fauci runs the Wuhan lab, lies about it all, puts out nothing but disinformation, gets caught lying about it.
[01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:24.620]  Let's play this Pelosi clip where she, when we hear what she says herself, that we're all just collateral damage.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.202]  Who cares what happens to us?
[01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:28.764]  She's not talking about even her constituents.
[01:03:28.784 --> 01:03:32.949]  She's talking about the globalists and how they're going to do whatever they want because they're in a total war against us.
[01:03:32.969 --> 01:03:33.329]  Here it is.
[01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:39.015]  I think that we owe the American people to be there for them.
[01:03:39.476 --> 01:03:40.156]  Oh yeah.
[01:03:40.397 --> 01:03:42.499]  For their financial security.
[01:03:43.717 --> 01:03:47.278]  Respecting the dignity and worth of every person in our country.
[01:03:48.098 --> 01:03:55.881]  And if there's some collateral damage for some others who do not share our view, well, so be it.
[01:03:55.921 --> 01:03:56.661]  But it shouldn't be.
[01:03:57.322 --> 01:04:04.144]  So she presided over offshoring all our jobs, getting us into debt, the lockdown that will probably never come out of it that's wrecked everything.
[01:04:05.214 --> 01:04:17.960]  Oh, but sheep, we need to stand up for the American people when their paid agitators say, no borders, no wall, no USA at all, blow up the police department in Austin, says the official budget!
[01:04:19.341 --> 01:04:30.627]  Because folks, if they can blow up the police station, after cutting down all the statues, and then take all that money and give it to their leftist organizations, they're seizing power!
[01:04:32.732 --> 01:04:36.713]  And Ilhan Omar said, and then we'll have a new police department under our control.
[01:04:36.933 --> 01:04:37.813]  She said it last week.
[01:04:39.093 --> 01:04:41.534]  We'll build something wonderful.
[01:04:42.334 --> 01:04:44.634]  Oh, like you did in Somalia, lady, and we saved you?
[01:04:44.854 --> 01:04:47.835]  And you come here and squat on us and piss in our face?
[01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:49.735]  Go to hell, you racist witch.
[01:04:51.376 --> 01:04:52.456]  I didn't plug last hour.
[01:04:52.516 --> 01:04:53.456]  I'm going to plug right now.
[01:04:54.036 --> 01:04:56.597]  Your financial support is obviously the total zeitgeist.
[01:04:56.617 --> 01:04:58.157]  We've proven we're in the center of the fight.
[01:04:58.237 --> 01:05:00.018]  You are the center of the fight supporting us.
[01:05:00.038 --> 01:05:02.058]  There's not a place you can spend your money.
[01:05:03.393 --> 01:05:10.039]  That will have a better effect, dollar for dollar, to get the truth out for a pro-human future for all of us who have red blood.
[01:05:11.834 --> 01:05:12.694]  But the others can't help you.
[01:05:13.294 --> 01:05:16.115]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it just comes down to that.
[01:05:16.355 --> 01:05:17.695]  It's common sense.
[01:05:18.256 --> 01:05:19.236]  It's what you need to do.
[01:05:19.596 --> 01:05:21.216]  We're bringing in enough money to operate.
[01:05:21.656 --> 01:05:22.577]  I need a war chest.
[01:05:23.217 --> 01:05:25.417]  I need to build serious operations.
[01:05:25.477 --> 01:05:27.718]  I've got so many blueprints, so many plans.
[01:05:28.018 --> 01:05:28.758]  I'm not bragging.
[01:05:28.798 --> 01:05:30.699]  It's been God's blessing and God's discernment.
[01:05:30.779 --> 01:05:31.719]  All glory goes to Christ.
[01:05:32.039 --> 01:05:37.060]  But let me tell you, we've proven that we're like Babe Ruth picks where he's gonna hit the ball, and he does it.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.641]  I will do it, but man, I need baseball bats and balls, folks.
[01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:45.584]  It takes money, and thanks to God and your support, we're holding the enemy back, but barely.
[01:05:46.265 --> 01:05:58.714]  So we got books and t-shirts and films and water filtration and storable food you need, and supplements, and activated charcoal toothpaste with no additives, and that's enamel safe, incredibly high quality, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:59.995 --> 01:06:05.599]  We had to end the free shipping because we did the numbers and the metrics, and we're not making money to fund ourselves with that for now.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.222]  And we had to stop all the stuff that was selling out.
[01:06:11.345 --> 01:06:19.249]  But we are, have Ultra 12, DNA Force Plus, Winter Sun, Chill Force, Super Female Vitality, Biotrin, Selenium, Accentuize, and others still 50% off.
[01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:21.250]  Take advantage of that.
[01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:24.351]  Reopen America, back to school special, and it's going to have to end soon.
[01:06:25.071 --> 01:06:31.354]  Get your privacy pockets as well at InfoWarsware.com so you can secure your phones from hackers and the criminals that run our government.
[01:06:31.374 --> 01:06:31.834]  Stay with us.
[01:06:33.035 --> 01:06:36.917]  All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls now, and I'm going to try to just get to each person and move to the next person.
[01:06:37.938 --> 01:06:38.759]  So no need to thank me.
[01:06:39.019 --> 01:06:39.799]  No need for me to thank you.
[01:06:39.819 --> 01:06:40.540]  We all love each other.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.381]  Except for callers that may disagree.
[01:06:42.481 --> 01:06:43.382]  We're in the fight together.
[01:06:43.402 --> 01:06:43.942]  So let's get to your point.
[01:06:43.962 --> 01:06:44.803]  We'll move to the next person.
[01:06:45.603 --> 01:06:47.484]  But this is beyond a historic point.
[01:06:47.524 --> 01:06:50.886]  This is humanity's destiny being decided right now.
[01:06:50.926 --> 01:07:02.294]  And the entire architecture of technology has been designed to make us obsolete, make us domesticated, to then take control of us through social credit scores where the police aren't even needed.
[01:07:03.669 --> 01:07:21.891]  The computers and the AI and the digital global government of the big tech system will decide what is acceptable behavior and then if you don't follow it, you will be basically made a homeless person and then they will have paramilitary gangs who are on the streets who will beat you to death and there'll be no police to protect you.
[01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:31.513]  And the paramilitary gangs will not attack their own people because they will be followed by a social credit score and will be rewarded for only killing those that are on the globalist hit list.
[01:07:31.913 --> 01:07:39.435]  So you've got the Maoist model along with the fascist Nazi model under big tech in their own admissions at Davos.
[01:07:40.036 --> 01:07:43.317]  And they believe Xi Jinping, they said two years ago, would crush Trump in America.
[01:07:43.337 --> 01:07:46.478]  And they said that they would use global crises to do it.
[01:07:46.538 --> 01:07:47.138]  So it's Fauci.
[01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:50.519]  So they're very public about what they've done.
[01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:59.264]  It's just if medical doctors try to go on Sinclair Broadcasting and say, hey, Fauci ran the lab, here's the documents, it gets canceled.
[01:07:59.864 --> 01:08:02.005]  Or they try to go speak out at a press conference, they get canceled.
[01:08:02.025 --> 01:08:06.268]  But that's why InfoWars is so incredibly precious.
[01:08:07.229 --> 01:08:17.776]  That's why Band.Video is so incredibly precious and why I just literally thank God every day that you supported us, that we got crew that was able to build it, working with some different engineers, cobbling it together from around the world.
[01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:21.270]  And to still be on air to challenge the new world order.
[01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:23.290]  It is such an important moment.
[01:08:24.691 --> 01:08:31.652]  And so please don't take it for granted and share those articles and share those videos at Infowars.com, Newswars.com and Band.Video.
[01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:34.453]  It's just really precious what we've all been able to do here together.
[01:08:34.473 --> 01:08:35.593]  So praise, praise the Lord.
[01:08:36.134 --> 01:08:36.474]  Okay.
[01:08:39.754 --> 01:08:41.575]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:45.456]  We got Preston, Harrison, Adam, Zach, Joe, Rick, Beth,
[01:08:48.015 --> 01:08:50.277]  Michaela, Mike, and others.
[01:08:52.619 --> 01:08:56.702]  And let's go ahead and talk to Preston in Idaho.
[01:08:56.742 --> 01:08:57.302]  Thanks for calling.
[01:09:00.044 --> 01:09:00.805]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:09:01.045 --> 01:09:03.227]  I sure can, go ahead.
[01:09:03.307 --> 01:09:13.475]  Yeah, I just, you know, listening to Owen a couple weeks ago on the show, he said, he asked, when are we the people going to move against the Deep State?
[01:09:13.495 --> 01:09:15.236]  They've already declared war on us.
[01:09:15.397 --> 01:09:16.317]  We see the mass of it.
[01:09:19.103 --> 01:09:30.132]  So when is it, you know, they're into symbolism, why don't we the people call on Trump to take military hit teams and take out these people that are committing treason against this country?
[01:09:30.532 --> 01:09:32.774]  We know names, and this is the Bushes.
[01:09:33.414 --> 01:09:44.663]  So why are we not using our military hit teams to kick doors, take them into custody, run military tribunals, and have them executed for the treason they've committed against this country?
[01:09:46.124 --> 01:09:46.945]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:09:49.369 --> 01:09:53.590]  Historically, when you do things like that, it kind of turns into the thing you were fighting.
[01:09:53.650 --> 01:09:59.932]  It's the infrastructure and our own political corruption and our own decadence that has allowed these systems to be set up.
[01:09:59.972 --> 01:10:01.132]  What we need is sunlight.
[01:10:01.512 --> 01:10:02.632]  We don't need censorship.
[01:10:02.652 --> 01:10:08.233]  We need an open, free internet for Americans to debate and decide what they want with public utilities that is the internet.
[01:10:08.754 --> 01:10:11.434]  We also then can debate all day who the elites are.
[01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:14.155]  If you just say, kill the elites, you get a French Revolution.
[01:10:15.215 --> 01:10:17.516]  That ends up putting the very worst criminals in charge.
[01:10:18.117 --> 01:10:20.998]  The Bushes are really bad people, but I mean, who do we stop with?
[01:10:21.398 --> 01:10:22.919]  And plus, they don't run anything, really.
[01:10:22.959 --> 01:10:25.921]  That's a declining, social-climbing front family.
[01:10:26.321 --> 01:10:39.668]  Prescott Bush, the head of the family, the senator over George Herbert Walker Bush and then his son, George W., he just simply was one of the top lawyers of Brown Brother Harriman that got a lot of the Nazi money after World War II.
[01:10:41.247 --> 01:10:46.109]  Uh, via Latin America, so that's what made them big wheels in the CIA and things when it was founded in 47.
[01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:56.935]  Now his young son was made the head of it because they were able to use that money, uh, to then launder it and, and, and leverage what is, uh, in today's numbers, hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:10:57.655 --> 01:11:01.657]  And so even if you know that whole background, we just, oh, the Bushes, they're the ones that run it.
[01:11:01.697 --> 01:11:02.117]  Get them.
[01:11:02.497 --> 01:11:08.060]  When the Bushes are very little involved with Epstein and the Clintons and that whole combine.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:09.401]  So, so it just becomes this thing of,
[01:11:10.515 --> 01:11:13.136]  It's the systems of the globalists that have to be dismantled.
[01:11:13.476 --> 01:11:14.557]  It's their operations.
[01:11:14.617 --> 01:11:16.998]  It's their whole program that must be rejected.
[01:11:17.018 --> 01:11:19.199]  We have to kill their ideas, not them.
[01:11:19.239 --> 01:11:19.999]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.582]  You know, it's very primitive because it's very true.
[01:11:25.142 --> 01:11:26.683]  We march on the enemy stronghold.
[01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:27.803]  We march on Washington.
[01:11:29.624 --> 01:11:31.145]  But they're running their operations from space.
[01:11:31.925 --> 01:11:34.446]  They're running it from Colorado, underground.
[01:11:34.486 --> 01:11:35.907]  I mean, it's a whole other issue.
[01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:37.908]  We have to get control of the government.
[01:11:38.925 --> 01:11:40.466]  And then dismantle it in a peaceful way.
[01:11:40.486 --> 01:11:41.926]  They want us civil warring in the streets.
[01:11:42.167 --> 01:11:43.247]  They want us shutting the economy up.
[01:11:43.267 --> 01:11:45.988]  They want us killing each other in the process of getting our country back.
[01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:47.989]  That's why they launched the civil war.
[01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:50.570]  We want to kill them intellectually.
[01:11:52.951 --> 01:11:53.692]  But I will tell you...
[01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:05.238]  It's too serious an issue for me, not because of safety issues.
[01:12:05.258 --> 01:12:08.259]  Bill Gates is coming at us with deadly vaccines that he says will hurt us and kill us.
[01:12:08.519 --> 01:12:09.520]  He says we don't have a choice.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.201]  And he says he wants to depopulate us.
[01:12:11.981 --> 01:12:17.284]  So anyone coming to try to forcefully inoculate you or take your job or not let you fly, they're assaulting you.
[01:12:18.445 --> 01:12:20.386]  They're imprisoning you for not taking their poison.
[01:12:20.406 --> 01:12:21.186]  They're trying to rape you.
[01:12:21.887 --> 01:12:23.968]  And so we are crossing into an area where
[01:12:25.037 --> 01:12:26.778]  The default does become violence.
[01:12:27.378 --> 01:12:31.161]  And then the person we would talk about would be the front man of this, Fauci or Bill Gates.
[01:12:31.861 --> 01:12:33.062]  That's not my place.
[01:12:35.256 --> 01:12:37.977]  And there could be attempts on their lives that turn them into victims.
[01:12:37.997 --> 01:12:39.357]  In fact, they're probably going to stage that.
[01:12:39.577 --> 01:12:40.457]  That'd be the move I'd pull.
[01:12:40.838 --> 01:12:46.719]  So I don't wish any harm upon them physically, but their names should be destroyed with their own statements, their own corruption, their own words.
[01:12:47.519 --> 01:12:52.501]  When they go on TV and say, oh, we're victims, people are being mean to us, and they whine and complain, makes people hate them more.
[01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:56.802]  And I almost don't want to come on air and tell them, hey, don't come out on TV anymore.
[01:12:57.182 --> 01:12:59.303]  Don't say you don't want to forcibly inoculate us.
[01:12:59.603 --> 01:13:04.384]  Don't say there's no digital tattoo, because all your companies are on record pushing it on the same damn channels.
[01:13:05.828 --> 01:13:07.909]  But see, they have God complexes.
[01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:11.091]  They're a little scared now, which makes them more dangerous.
[01:13:11.111 --> 01:13:11.852]  They're not as arrogant.
[01:13:11.892 --> 01:13:13.753]  They still think they're gonna win.
[01:13:15.734 --> 01:13:18.816]  And so, I don't want Nancy Pelosi to die.
[01:13:19.456 --> 01:13:20.517]  I don't want Joe Biden to die.
[01:13:20.617 --> 01:13:21.698]  I don't want Bill Gates to die.
[01:13:22.819 --> 01:13:29.483]  Because they're evil, detached, skexy puppets of their master, the fallen one.
[01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:32.747]  And the Bible tells you, the fallen one, all on the planet.
[01:13:33.528 --> 01:13:35.569]  And so they're bad puppets.
[01:13:35.609 --> 01:13:36.810]  They're weak puppets.
[01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:40.452]  They're puppets that we've spent time destroying their names.
[01:13:41.173 --> 01:13:43.334]  We've spent time exposing them as the enemy.
[01:13:43.894 --> 01:13:45.735]  We've captured their identities now.
[01:13:46.576 --> 01:13:47.897]  They think they've captured my identity?
[01:13:48.017 --> 01:13:48.797]  Other way around.
[01:13:49.218 --> 01:13:52.820]  You've only made me rise and be even stronger, but that's God's will.
[01:13:58.188 --> 01:14:00.270]  And so no, pray for Bill Gates.
[01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:01.091]  That's what Christ told us.
[01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:04.315]  Pray for our enemies and pray for God to bring vengeance upon them.
[01:14:06.517 --> 01:14:08.320]  I wouldn't want to be Bill Gates late at night.
[01:14:10.902 --> 01:14:12.304]  I know people that know all these folks.
[01:14:12.344 --> 01:14:13.786]  These people are scared at night.
[01:14:14.767 --> 01:14:16.829]  They've got to have people in the room with them to hold their hand.
[01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:19.012]  Lady Gaga, all of them.
[01:14:20.469 --> 01:14:21.289]  They're all scared.
[01:14:21.309 --> 01:14:22.610]  They're all cut off from God.
[01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:23.310]  They're so scared.
[01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:24.371]  They got into evil.
[01:14:24.391 --> 01:14:25.291]  They were born into evil.
[01:14:25.591 --> 01:14:27.072]  And now it's all they've got.
[01:14:27.112 --> 01:14:27.912]  And they're scared.
[01:14:28.473 --> 01:14:29.413]  They're not leaders.
[01:14:29.793 --> 01:14:31.254]  Bill Gates isn't a commander.
[01:14:31.294 --> 01:14:32.174]  He's not a force.
[01:14:32.575 --> 01:14:33.455]  He's a wraith.
[01:14:34.816 --> 01:14:35.916]  He's a puppet.
[01:14:36.416 --> 01:14:37.557]  He's empty air.
[01:14:38.898 --> 01:14:39.718]  He's a tool.
[01:14:40.598 --> 01:14:41.779]  He's an extension of evil.
[01:14:43.442 --> 01:14:44.824]  We must raise our children.
[01:14:44.944 --> 01:14:46.986]  We must say no to the vaccines and no to the masks.
[01:14:47.046 --> 01:14:48.588]  We must shop at local companies.
[01:14:48.849 --> 01:14:49.710]  We must garden.
[01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:50.531]  We must farm.
[01:14:50.571 --> 01:14:51.292]  We must ranch.
[01:14:51.532 --> 01:14:52.213]  We must shoot.
[01:14:52.313 --> 01:14:52.994]  We must fight.
[01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:54.656]  We must climb.
[01:14:55.016 --> 01:14:57.800]  We must get into power to defend the people from these enemies.
[01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:11.138]  Not the statement of, and I've said to the President and factions in the government that don't let China start a war, don't let the globalists trigger a race war, don't let them blow up buildings and blame it on us.
[01:15:11.578 --> 01:15:22.001]  If there's violence at an intelligence agency level, and the courts are so corrupt in most areas, you have a right under common law and under common sense, the Declaration of Independence, as an arm of the people
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.602]  They've already fired shots first.
[01:15:25.303 --> 01:15:26.204]  They came for a war.
[01:15:26.584 --> 01:15:27.285]  They're going to get one.
[01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:28.266]  We're not going to shoot first.
[01:15:28.627 --> 01:15:29.828]  But they already have really shot.
[01:15:30.389 --> 01:15:41.262]  But that really is the place of Trump and of the military and of factions inside the intelligence agencies that aren't on a suicide pack, would say.
[01:15:42.253 --> 01:15:46.855]  And so it's not my place to sit here and say who needs to die or who needs to be killed.
[01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:49.376]  We've elected President Trump to be the Commander-in-Chief.
[01:15:49.416 --> 01:15:53.698]  We're under a world government chi-com-backed attack to have civil war and death.
[01:15:53.999 --> 01:16:01.962]  And it's the President's responsibility to absolutely burn the globalists however he can, releasing their corruption, releasing their evil.
[01:16:02.162 --> 01:16:03.543]  Who cares what it does to the stock market?
[01:16:03.743 --> 01:16:08.105]  And then when they strike back physically at the President, they need to be dealt with as terrorists.
[01:16:08.806 --> 01:16:10.226]  Don't negotiate with terrorists.
[01:16:10.767 --> 01:16:11.307]  Deal with them.
[01:16:13.231 --> 01:16:19.895]  All right, that caller brought up a really good question, a really good point, and I spent the whole segment on it, so let's try to get four or five callers in in this segment.
[01:16:20.736 --> 01:16:22.717]  We're just going in the order they have been received here.
[01:16:24.318 --> 01:16:27.100]  Let's go ahead and go to Michaela in Illinois.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.440]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:16:31.822 --> 01:16:32.103]  Hello?
[01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:33.203]  Yes, go ahead, welcome.
[01:16:34.084 --> 01:16:41.608]  Hello, yes, so I just have quickly have a point I'd like to make about the releasing of criminals and from the prisons and from the
[01:16:43.306 --> 01:16:52.035]  And while we're locked down, so basically let me give people a little idea of what they're going to do to you on a more specific level, especially for those of you who are behind all this nonsense and are virtue signaling.
[01:16:52.055 --> 01:16:57.881]  Let me give you a little idea of what's going to happen to you once they drag you off to camp, prison, or whatever.
[01:16:58.501 --> 01:17:02.926]  As you know, guys, so for those of you who aren't familiar with the French Revolution, there's a thing called the September Massacres.
[01:17:03.416 --> 01:17:13.500]  In which basically they took all the people that they jailed, including a lot of people who are not guilty of doing anything, people who simply oppose, or many people who are just simply there, not obeying the diktats of the revolutionary government.
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:17.922]  They are going to lock your ass up, and then the criminals that they let out, guess what?
[01:17:17.942 --> 01:17:19.563]  Those are going to be your new jailers, people.
[01:17:19.623 --> 01:17:26.285]  These are the people who are going to- And that's what the Nazis did, that's what the Soviets did, they all mounted that, you're absolutely right, historically.
[01:17:26.586 --> 01:17:30.807]  That's why they're saying, we're letting murderers and rapists out of jail, but if you don't wear a mask, you're going to jail.
[01:17:30.847 --> 01:17:32.368]  That's just a cover to grab whoever they want.
[01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:34.762]  Yes, and then those criminals that they let out?
[01:17:35.222 --> 01:17:35.682]  Guess what?
[01:17:35.722 --> 01:17:37.823]  Oh, and this goes for those people protesting, by the way.
[01:17:37.843 --> 01:17:39.123]  If you're protesting, guess what?
[01:17:39.143 --> 01:17:41.164]  When they're all done, you're going to jail, too.
[01:17:41.244 --> 01:17:41.904]  And then guess who?
[01:17:41.944 --> 01:17:45.465]  The people that you stood up for, the people that you said, oh, we want justice for these people?
[01:17:45.725 --> 01:17:47.266]  They're the ones who are going to be killing you in prison.
[01:17:48.058 --> 01:17:53.280]  They are the ones who are going to be massacring you, raping you, whatever is going on, and then it's just going to be like the September Massacre.
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:18:06.144]  And by the way, you're absolutely right, sir, because this is a Jacobin communist formula launched by the, this isn't history books, folks, the Illuminati launched the French Revolution on record to take total power.
[01:18:06.824 --> 01:18:09.165]  And of course, it ended up with Napoleon as a dictator later.
[01:18:10.037 --> 01:18:10.638]  Look up that one.
[01:18:10.658 --> 01:18:12.940]  I urge people, look up the September Massacres.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:13.781]  See what happened.
[01:18:13.801 --> 01:18:20.267]  They mostly got criminals, mostly from the Italian prisons of Northern Italy, shipped them into France, and then got them to do their cleaning in the prison.
[01:18:20.737 --> 01:18:22.479]  That's what they're importing all these people for.
[01:18:22.499 --> 01:18:23.880]  We're not importing the best immigrants.
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.982]  We're importing a lot of lower class people that even their home countries don't want them.
[01:18:27.283 --> 01:18:28.303]  Those are going to be your jails.
[01:18:28.324 --> 01:18:28.764]  No, exactly.
[01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:31.846]  They're dumping the criminals out and now they've got armed gun trucks.
[01:18:32.367 --> 01:18:33.488]  We can put that back on screen.
[01:18:34.188 --> 01:18:37.171]  Armed gun trucks driving around Austin pointing guns at people randomly.
[01:18:37.191 --> 01:18:37.852]  You go, why?
[01:18:37.952 --> 01:18:39.153]  Why point guns at an old lady?
[01:18:39.493 --> 01:18:41.054]  It's about power and terror.
[01:18:41.114 --> 01:18:42.295]  They're the authority, they're saying.
[01:18:42.776 --> 01:18:44.958]  And the city council says, blow up the police station.
[01:18:45.905 --> 01:18:51.749]  And most of the police in power positions are groveling and signaling because they understand it's part of a larger plan.
[01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.790]  How do we counter this?
[01:18:53.651 --> 01:18:55.012]  Alright, so here's my idea.
[01:18:55.032 --> 01:18:58.314]  Number one, the further they go, the harder it is to stand up to them.
[01:18:58.374 --> 01:19:01.597]  So right now, the mask, like I said, perfect hill to die on.
[01:19:02.355 --> 01:19:03.336]  Get people with you.
[01:19:03.556 --> 01:19:06.078]  Stop wearing the damn masks.
[01:19:06.098 --> 01:19:06.619]  I agree.
[01:19:06.699 --> 01:19:09.782]  In groups, we should all go in stores and hand out flyers.
[01:19:10.342 --> 01:19:11.263]  There's one more, Alex.
[01:19:11.283 --> 01:19:12.104]  There's actually one more.
[01:19:12.184 --> 01:19:13.345]  Keep going, sorry.
[01:19:13.365 --> 01:19:13.805]  Real quick.
[01:19:14.306 --> 01:19:16.147]  If everyone, go to your phone contacts.
[01:19:16.508 --> 01:19:18.049]  Copy the link to Bandout Video.
[01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:19.771]  Choose one contact.
[01:19:19.971 --> 01:19:20.451]  Send it out.
[01:19:20.591 --> 01:19:20.932]  One a day.
[01:19:23.169 --> 01:19:24.650]  Let's say one million people are listening.
[01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:32.212]  If each person does that, each one day, think of how many people you could reach just by the law of X. Let's go back to your genius idea.
[01:19:33.612 --> 01:19:35.133]  We should get together as a crew.
[01:19:35.153 --> 01:19:40.294]  I should tell listeners, you know, like with two hours notice, hey, let's show up at this, say, Walmart.
[01:19:40.755 --> 01:19:44.936]  We all go in, we all meet up, and we hand out flyers we have on the website about how it's all a fraud.
[01:19:45.296 --> 01:19:47.217]  And events like that will be seismic.
[01:19:47.237 --> 01:19:48.497]  We have to start pushing back.
[01:19:49.096 --> 01:19:51.778]  Yeah, I mean, if not, look, if it's not, it's going to end up with what?
[01:19:51.879 --> 01:19:55.222]  I guess France, they killed out of the population of 20 million.
[01:19:55.282 --> 01:19:58.645]  They killed five, I think, as a result of the revolution, Napoleonic Wars.
[01:19:58.685 --> 01:20:02.428]  Just multiply that on a scale of many now because of what we're capable of technologically.
[01:20:02.448 --> 01:20:07.993]  That's right, because once the Jacobins get control, they then put an emperor in and then conscript everybody.
[01:20:08.133 --> 01:20:09.254]  And that's what communists do.
[01:20:09.274 --> 01:20:11.596]  And then they try to exploit the nation to take over the planet.
[01:20:11.877 --> 01:20:15.320]  And again, National Socialist Hitler was modeling it off communists as well.
[01:20:17.282 --> 01:20:17.542]  Mm-hmm.
[01:20:17.562 --> 01:20:20.465]  I tell you, it's good to have callers like you that have done their history.
[01:20:20.505 --> 01:20:21.325]  How crazy is it?
[01:20:21.726 --> 01:20:23.207]  What got you into history, Michaela?
[01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:26.750]  I've been into it since I was a very young child.
[01:20:27.791 --> 01:20:32.935]  It's fascinating stuff, and then it'll just get to you all the more because of how stupid people are not to read it.
[01:20:33.275 --> 01:20:39.320]  Now, here in Chicago, we have our congressmen calling, our congressmen, our aldermen calling for history classes to be abolished.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:40.641]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[01:20:40.881 --> 01:20:41.622]  That's right out of 1984.
[01:20:42.403 --> 01:20:43.544]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:20:43.584 --> 01:20:44.905]  I don't want you to know where they come from.
[01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:47.071]  Exactly.
[01:20:47.131 --> 01:20:49.535]  I mean, this is 1984 where they abolish history.
[01:20:51.057 --> 01:20:52.799]  And we're having that right here, right now.
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:53.961]  God bless you, sir.
[01:20:54.021 --> 01:20:54.823]  No, it's incredible.
[01:20:55.163 --> 01:20:56.906]  Because ignorance is strength in 1984.
[01:20:59.278 --> 01:21:01.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're not able to hide out anymore.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.461]  I know listeners of this show already know this.
[01:21:02.782 --> 01:21:04.804]  I mean, they're coming down on us, folks.
[01:21:05.505 --> 01:21:06.646]  They think you're so stupid.
[01:21:06.726 --> 01:21:08.648]  Fauci and Gates ran the Wuhan lab.
[01:21:08.868 --> 01:21:10.170]  They run the major vaccines.
[01:21:10.190 --> 01:21:12.192]  They admit it's hurting everybody that takes it.
[01:21:12.372 --> 01:21:13.293]  And they say, we're coming.
[01:21:13.333 --> 01:21:13.894]  We don't care.
[01:21:14.134 --> 01:21:14.955]  And big tech's coming.
[01:21:14.975 --> 01:21:15.496]  They don't care.
[01:21:15.556 --> 01:21:16.677]  They think you're done.
[01:21:17.037 --> 01:21:18.359]  They think you're going to roll over.
[01:21:18.619 --> 01:21:19.961]  And now they're on NBC News.
[01:21:21.317 --> 01:21:24.160]  Saying get rid of history classes.
[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:29.024]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it!
[01:21:31.206 --> 01:21:32.407]  Unbelievable.
[01:21:32.467 --> 01:21:33.908]  This is a war on reality.
[01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:37.612]  All right, let's go to another caller who's been holding longest now.
[01:21:38.152 --> 01:21:39.493]  That'd be Joe in Indiana.
[01:21:39.533 --> 01:21:40.614]  Joe, thanks for calling.
[01:21:42.116 --> 01:21:43.197]  Alex, nice to speak with you.
[01:21:43.537 --> 01:21:45.259]  I just want to plug for your product real quick.
[01:21:45.379 --> 01:21:46.780]  I bought one of your t-shirts.
[01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:48.170]  It's phenomenal, man.
[01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:49.011]  It fits great.
[01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:50.691]  It's very, very comfortable.
[01:21:51.052 --> 01:21:53.112]  And design, it's an eye-catcher, man.
[01:21:53.152 --> 01:22:00.215]  I got one of the Space Force ones, and I'm looking forward to buying this next Bessie Ross Flag Eagle job that you got going on.
[01:22:00.235 --> 01:22:01.816]  Well, thanks for keeping us in the fight, brother.
[01:22:01.836 --> 01:22:03.117]  That's all I want to do, is stay in the fight.
[01:22:03.137 --> 01:22:05.057]  And without you guys spending money with us, we're dead.
[01:22:05.778 --> 01:22:07.658]  But your word of mouth is even more important.
[01:22:08.639 --> 01:22:09.079]  Yes, sir.
[01:22:09.479 --> 01:22:13.901]  And I just wanted to talk about something that came across me real quick.
[01:22:13.961 --> 01:22:16.282]  I'm here in Indiana, the heartland of America.
[01:22:16.977 --> 01:22:21.361]  And, uh, I haven't been going into spots that, you know, require a face mask.
[01:22:21.381 --> 01:22:23.243]  You know, obviously they're not good for us.
[01:22:23.263 --> 01:22:26.986]  So I've been going to places like my local Amish store and stuff like that.
[01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:27.987]  They're very happy to see me.
[01:22:28.047 --> 01:22:28.907]  Oh, that's the answer.
[01:22:28.927 --> 01:22:31.450]  This shows that shopping with the big guys is death.
[01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:33.291]  We have to shop local.
[01:22:33.571 --> 01:22:34.892]  We have to build that economy.
[01:22:35.533 --> 01:22:35.753]  Yep.
[01:22:35.893 --> 01:22:36.053]  Yep.
[01:22:36.134 --> 01:22:36.614]  Absolutely.
[01:22:36.674 --> 01:22:41.818]  So I had to, recently I had to, I had to unfortunately submit and put that mask on because I had to go to a clinic.
[01:22:41.838 --> 01:22:43.780]  I had, I had a really awful rash.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:44.661]  So I had to go.
[01:22:45.442 --> 01:22:48.985]  And I go in there and I'm walking into the store.
[01:22:49.165 --> 01:22:51.507]  It's one of those clinics in the store type of deal.
[01:22:51.567 --> 01:22:58.793]  I'm walking into the store and I realize how much this is conditioning us to take the mark of the beast.
[01:22:59.653 --> 01:23:01.275]  Because before I would not go.
[01:23:01.295 --> 01:23:06.899]  And then I go and I submit it and you're like, oh, now you have the pleasures of the entire store that the Amish market doesn't have.
[01:23:07.714 --> 01:23:09.434]  Because I submitted to put that mask on.
[01:23:09.815 --> 01:23:12.415]  And next, after this mask, it's going to be something else.
[01:23:12.855 --> 01:23:16.256]  It's going to be a contact tracing app that's already on your phone, whether you like it or not.
[01:23:16.276 --> 01:23:18.157]  They made the agreement six months ago.
[01:23:18.177 --> 01:23:20.077]  They already tested it in China two years ago.
[01:23:20.437 --> 01:23:21.898]  And it's going to be forced inoculation.
[01:23:22.118 --> 01:23:23.038]  And it is forced.
[01:23:23.058 --> 01:23:26.119]  They make you take it to get on a plane, get on a bus, have a job.
[01:23:26.139 --> 01:23:27.139]  Yep.
[01:23:27.319 --> 01:23:33.621]  And to talk about your first caller, he seemed very irritable and not really sure on how to go.
[01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:34.561]  He's very upset about it.
[01:23:34.581 --> 01:23:35.201]  I got to tell him,
[01:23:36.398 --> 01:23:40.461]  What we need to do is be in prayer, because God's going to lead us through this.
[01:23:41.021 --> 01:23:45.244]  We need to be in prayer for our leaders, and we need to be in prayer for the pastors of our churches to lead us.
[01:23:45.645 --> 01:23:49.928]  And with the last call, what you said about a meet-up, that is a terrific idea.
[01:23:50.148 --> 01:23:57.253]  And we need to get that throughout the entire country, and we need to do what he said about dropping a message with the Vandav video to one contact that did it.
[01:23:57.273 --> 01:23:59.055]  That's a fantastic idea also.
[01:23:59.568 --> 01:24:09.278]  I just want to thank you guys for what you guys do, and I want people to remember there were many warriors and battles that were in the Bible that God helped conquer, and we need to be sure that we're on the right side.
[01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:10.259]  That's right.
[01:24:10.299 --> 01:24:11.080]  God bless you, sir.
[01:24:12.582 --> 01:24:16.466]  Now, thetopofdrugreport.com is where we told you all this was going.
[01:24:17.961 --> 01:24:24.346]  The top of drugreport.com, electronic tags in Singapore to enforce quarantine, and monkey see monkey do.
[01:24:24.386 --> 01:24:32.393]  We saw communist China that's killed 115 million of their own people, board up windows, shoot women at checkpoints, drones policing the public.
[01:24:32.733 --> 01:24:33.834]  Oh, we better have that!
[01:24:33.974 --> 01:24:38.758]  That's what you do when the pneumonia happens, and then they lie about it, and they exaggerate it.
[01:24:39.378 --> 01:24:43.540]  And so now we're being told, oh, the answer is Singapore.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.623]  We all have to wear little bracelet tracker chips that track where we go, what we do.
[01:24:49.643 --> 01:24:51.184]  And then it's, oh, it's so much easier now.
[01:24:51.504 --> 01:24:55.626]  It's just on your phone, but you better have it or it's six months in jail.
[01:24:56.986 --> 01:25:01.108]  And again, Singapore was set up by the British Empire with the Communist Chinese.
[01:25:01.228 --> 01:25:03.329]  It is the model of tyranny even beyond China.
[01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:05.030]  It is an island beta test.
[01:25:08.049 --> 01:25:15.276]  Meanwhile, Kentucky couple on house arrest for not signing positive COVID-19 self-isolation order.
[01:25:15.697 --> 01:25:17.659]  And again, all the tests are completely fake.
[01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:22.524]  If you've ever had the flu or a cold, the last decade on average, it will show up as false positive.
[01:25:22.544 --> 01:25:23.164]  They designed it.
[01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:25.166]  So the more they test, what do Democrats say?
[01:25:25.406 --> 01:25:26.668]  Testing, testing, testing.
[01:25:27.028 --> 01:25:27.909]  To get false positives.
[01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:36.497]  And to get deaths, ventilators, ventilators, ventilators, and they give you $52,000 to say it's COVID and ventilate, even though that kills you, the studies show, because they want the death numbers.
[01:25:36.537 --> 01:25:39.399]  And it's all an example of, will you human sacrifice?
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.201]  Will you march off the edge of a cliff?
[01:25:41.441 --> 01:25:43.003]  Will you stampede over a gorge?
[01:25:43.243 --> 01:25:48.288]  Will you submit to their idiocy and suspend what you know and be a virtue signaler and wear the mask?
[01:25:48.308 --> 01:25:49.148]  Because you're a hero.
[01:25:50.031 --> 01:25:50.911]  As I covered last hour.
[01:25:51.492 --> 01:25:52.972]  The big article at GatewayPundit.com.
[01:25:53.312 --> 01:25:58.494]  Federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials on how best to persuade Americans to take COVID-19.
[01:25:58.874 --> 01:26:00.155]  They say they will embarrass you.
[01:26:00.635 --> 01:26:01.795]  They'll make people angry at you.
[01:26:01.835 --> 01:26:02.736]  They will guilt you.
[01:26:03.116 --> 01:26:03.996]  Trust in science.
[01:26:04.156 --> 01:26:05.037]  Trust in lies.
[01:26:05.337 --> 01:26:06.297]  Trust in frauds.
[01:26:07.177 --> 01:26:09.438]  We're gonna start the next hour and I'm gonna go to a ton of your calls.
[01:26:10.579 --> 01:26:13.020]  Up next, Mike in New York.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:14.100]  Then,
[01:26:16.323 --> 01:26:25.606]  Beth in California, Zach in Kentucky, Harrison in Oklahoma, Danny, and so many others back in two minutes.
[01:26:25.646 --> 01:26:26.786]  I mean, it's all here, folks.
[01:26:27.286 --> 01:26:30.747]  How did I tell you six months ago that they'd have re-lockdowns and then call for chips?
[01:26:30.767 --> 01:26:31.967]  Because it's all in the battle plan.
[01:26:32.368 --> 01:26:33.388]  It's all in lockstep.
[01:26:33.448 --> 01:26:34.368]  It's all in Event 201.
[01:26:34.968 --> 01:26:35.809]  It's all laid out.
[01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:39.229]  We just have to look at what the evil overlords are doing and say no.
[01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:42.710]  Humans kill humans.
[01:26:42.971 --> 01:26:43.951]  It's our epigenetics.
[01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:46.211]  And the globalists are using it against us.
[01:26:48.553 --> 01:26:50.595]  We have to start killing globalist ideas.
[01:26:53.057 --> 01:26:54.258]  All right, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:26:54.578 --> 01:26:55.539]  And look at these great callers.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.901]  We're going in the order you received.
[01:26:57.961 --> 01:26:58.862]  Mike's in New York.
[01:26:59.843 --> 01:27:00.543]  We've got Beth.
[01:27:00.683 --> 01:27:01.064]  We've got Rick.
[01:27:01.104 --> 01:27:03.486]  We're going to get to everybody this hour that's holding right now.
[01:27:04.306 --> 01:27:07.129]  In fact, if you can get in when they hang up, we'll take even more calls than that.
[01:27:07.149 --> 01:27:07.189]  877-789-2539.
[01:27:11.052 --> 01:27:14.414]  Let's go ahead, without further ado, and go to Mike in New York.
[01:27:14.434 --> 01:27:15.834]  Are you in New York State or New York City?
[01:27:17.375 --> 01:27:18.536]  Alex, upstate New York.
[01:27:18.576 --> 01:27:19.356]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:27:19.376 --> 01:27:20.577]  Oh, that's a beautiful area up there.
[01:27:20.597 --> 01:27:22.878]  Well, you're blessed like people are in other rural areas.
[01:27:23.578 --> 01:27:24.819]  Go ahead.
[01:27:24.899 --> 01:27:26.340]  Well, Alex, you'd think so, okay?
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.821]  Let me tell you something about here.
[01:27:28.281 --> 01:27:34.204]  There's a reason why people leave their doors unlocked and their cars unlocked, because they know everyone up here believes in the Second Amendment.
[01:27:35.024 --> 01:27:38.446]  No one's going to go breaking into people's houses up here, because they know the end result.
[01:27:39.139 --> 01:27:41.961]  What this governor has done to this state, okay?
[01:27:41.981 --> 01:27:44.043]  I live in a small village of 5,000 people.
[01:27:45.024 --> 01:27:55.993]  The same neighbors that I have turned to and said hi to every day are the same ones who have turned me in time and time again since I put up a Trump 2020 poster on my garage.
[01:27:56.973 --> 01:27:59.255]  I spent $40,000, we do in my house.
[01:27:59.616 --> 01:28:01.197]  I've had the county enforcer here.
[01:28:01.838 --> 01:28:02.519]  Three times.
[01:28:02.999 --> 01:28:04.360]  Because people are snitching on me.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.961]  Oh, they absolutely harass Trump supporters.
[01:28:07.462 --> 01:28:09.063]  Have you gone and talked to your neighbors about this?
[01:28:10.183 --> 01:28:10.544]  I have.
[01:28:10.704 --> 01:28:11.464]  I've confronted them.
[01:28:11.564 --> 01:28:17.548]  And just like every other little snitch would do, they point the finger and say it must be this one, that one, that one, that one.
[01:28:18.268 --> 01:28:27.254]  So, what I do... Now, I got Democrats down the street from me that have called code enforcement on me, I'm not exaggerating, over 100 times for nothing.
[01:28:27.674 --> 01:28:28.395]  They just lie.
[01:28:29.429 --> 01:28:30.450]  Alex, that's ridiculous.
[01:28:30.490 --> 01:28:34.134]  He came here with his big mask on and wanted a $25 amendment on my permit.
[01:28:36.428 --> 01:28:37.689]  And it was okay for him.
[01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:43.613]  We had to stay six feet apart, but when I dug in my pocket and handed him the $25, he gladly took that from my hand.
[01:28:43.673 --> 01:28:44.054]  Of course.
[01:28:44.514 --> 01:28:48.697]  It shows the absurdity of this goddamn virus that's out there.
[01:28:49.058 --> 01:29:01.867]  On top of that, so what I do is my neighbors, three of them here, have huge Biden signs, so I put my huge speaker on my fence, beautiful fence, and I loop your, I will eat your ass over and over and over.
[01:29:01.907 --> 01:29:02.287]  Beautiful!
[01:29:03.268 --> 01:29:04.629]  Because this is what this has done.
[01:29:05.169 --> 01:29:06.110]  And my own family.
[01:29:06.691 --> 01:29:08.532]  It's a shame what they're doing to families.
[01:29:09.292 --> 01:29:11.134]  Families are split apart because of this.
[01:29:12.074 --> 01:29:16.137]  Well, even people that know it's bull don't want confrontations at Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:29:16.177 --> 01:29:16.918]  Especially women.
[01:29:16.938 --> 01:29:17.618]  Nothing against women.
[01:29:18.099 --> 01:29:20.360]  But I have family that knows it's all bull, but they're like, Alex...
[01:29:21.266 --> 01:29:25.449]  Just please, they won't go out to eat with me anymore or anything because they think I'm gonna make a scene.
[01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:27.591]  I'm like, we're supposed to make a scene!
[01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:32.075]  Alex, because of you, I have one teacher in this school district, a U.S.
[01:29:32.255 --> 01:29:43.144]  teacher, you're talking about history, who has sent my kids your links, who has sent them directly to a 17-year-old, and he's the only one in my house who might think the same way I do.
[01:29:43.875 --> 01:29:52.682]  And because he got a Trump 20 sticker for his dad, my whole family flipped out and said, you can't do that, we're going to get run off the road, blah blah blah, you're listening to Raspi Voice, that's what they call you.
[01:29:53.242 --> 01:29:54.443]  They say he's brainwashing you.
[01:29:54.483 --> 01:29:57.165]  I say, oh my god, it's called common sense.
[01:29:58.366 --> 01:29:59.527]  What happened to common sense?
[01:30:00.007 --> 01:30:06.332]  We as parents, it's our fault because I didn't read my kid's school agenda and realized they weren't being taught history.
[01:30:07.193 --> 01:30:11.036]  And now the Democrats, not just here but in Europe, they want to quote, get rid of history.
[01:30:12.059 --> 01:30:13.960]  Because it's too, quote, ethnically white.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.443]  That's just the excuse to get rid of Western culture because that threatens the globalist culture that's anti-human.
[01:30:20.643 --> 01:30:24.885]  Alex, without you, I tell you what, you need to keep doing what you're doing.
[01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:30.588]  And whenever you're in upstate New York or anywhere here doing a rally or doing anything, please send out mass emails.
[01:30:30.728 --> 01:30:31.468]  We want to do it, Mike.
[01:30:31.508 --> 01:30:32.049]  We love you.
[01:30:32.329 --> 01:30:32.889]  We love you, Mike.
[01:30:32.929 --> 01:30:33.309]  Thank you.
[01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:34.190]  God bless you.
[01:30:35.233 --> 01:30:40.477]  We're a small infrastructure, and it costs a lot with the radio and TV satellites and all the crew and the whole thing.
[01:30:40.798 --> 01:30:43.160]  And the Democrats are suing the living daylights out of us.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:48.704]  And they say, we don't want to get just judgments on you and get money from you, even though we don't really have extra money.
[01:30:49.145 --> 01:30:50.025]  We want to shut you down.
[01:30:50.065 --> 01:30:50.966]  We want a kill shot.
[01:30:51.827 --> 01:30:52.647]  We want you off the air.
[01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:59.033]  And so believe me, sir, the Democrats have plans to try to put me in prison once they take me off the air.
[01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:01.014]  So when you tell me, please stay in the fight.
[01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:04.283]  I've got, like, wild dogs on my heels.
[01:31:04.303 --> 01:31:05.484]  You better believe I'm going to stand the fight.
[01:31:05.644 --> 01:31:07.384]  I know how real it is.
[01:31:08.844 --> 01:31:09.284]  Believe me.
[01:31:09.885 --> 01:31:12.105]  I know it's only going to get worse if they have their way.
[01:31:12.125 --> 01:31:14.886]  And, you know, the thing about it, they want to abolish the police.
[01:31:15.626 --> 01:31:16.446]  They're not going to abolish the police.
[01:31:16.466 --> 01:31:18.706]  They're going to take them over, and then we'll have a real police problem.
[01:31:18.927 --> 01:31:22.327]  And I'll tell you, the police are submitting too much to the globalist orders.
[01:31:22.367 --> 01:31:23.768]  The globalists hate the police.
[01:31:24.028 --> 01:31:25.828]  They need to wake up and fully join the people.
[01:31:26.288 --> 01:31:29.109]  So I'm telling you, if they can control the police, the police will be the enemy.
[01:31:29.449 --> 01:31:29.969]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:29.989 --> 01:31:30.329]  Stay with us.
[01:31:32.341 --> 01:31:38.604]  Again, I know why people listened to this show 25 years ago and thought this person's crazy.
[01:31:41.305 --> 01:31:48.448]  Because I was reading what UNESCO and the Club of Rome and the Bilderberg Group was saying and it's just...
[01:31:49.383 --> 01:32:12.474]  We'll use a global pandemic to have them accept UN troops in Los Angeles and we'll use racial division to have the UN bring in world control and we'll have an agenda to sterilize children under the name of transgenderism and people will think it's cool and we'll target all the autistic kids and and then they're just all the stuff I read I started reading all this stuff like 20
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.042]  Nine years ago or so.
[01:32:16.062 --> 01:32:21.271]  I mean, I'd read a lot of history books and stuff, but about three or four years before I got on air, two or three years, I really dove into it.
[01:32:23.649 --> 01:32:48.837]  What's incredible is if you think it sounds crazy and it's frightening, what I was reading to you on air 25 years ago, and most of that was old news, had already been written about years before, now the stuff they're writing is just like, oh, it's so wonderful, we're all gonna be gone, we're such parasites, humans are a disease, we've gotta be gotten rid of, and how dare you not like the head of UT Biology, Dr. Bianca, who wants to kill 90%?
[01:32:50.237 --> 01:32:51.177]  He's too liberal!
[01:32:51.458 --> 01:32:52.938]  All of us need to die!
[01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:53.978]  We're a parasite!
[01:32:54.279 --> 01:32:58.300]  And I'm reading op-ed articles in the newspaper about how we all need to die!
[01:33:01.461 --> 01:33:11.885]  And back then, that was 14 years ago, with the Pianca stuff, I said, where's the FBI talking to Pianca, who works inside a level 4 bioweapon lab at UT?
[01:33:13.993 --> 01:33:21.576]  Look at his former head assistant professor, who now works in another Level 4 bioweapon lab on the West Coast.
[01:33:21.976 --> 01:33:24.157]  She's the one writing articles about how we all need to die.
[01:33:24.617 --> 01:33:27.298]  I said, the FBI needs to go visit him.
[01:33:27.458 --> 01:33:28.179]  They actually did!
[01:33:28.199 --> 01:33:28.959]  It was in the newspaper.
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:37.022]  Because see, when you're in a Level 4 bioweapons lab, and you're saying everybody needs to die, you don't need to get a visit from the FBI.
[01:33:37.222 --> 01:33:38.323]  You need to be fired.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:50.785]  And you can go see the eugenics conferences that Bill Gates has had with all the heads of the Rockefeller and the Askers and the Vanderbilts.
[01:33:51.106 --> 01:34:04.954]  You can see photos with Fauci there with Anderson Cooper's, you know, rich mother, one of the richest people in the world before she died, giving almost all her money to helping you with vaccines and abortions.
[01:34:06.775 --> 01:34:08.696]  And they're just scum, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:11.590]  Up their eyeballs and kill everybody.
[01:34:13.111 --> 01:34:19.173]  See, that was 14, 15 years ago when the Texas Academy of Sciences gave him the highest award in his PowerPoint presentation.
[01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:30.079]  And he projected up on the screen an image of red skulls, a pile of African skulls with a red filter.
[01:34:30.619 --> 01:34:32.120]  It was Rwandan massacre skulls.
[01:34:33.117 --> 01:34:40.722]  He started crying saying, soon the airborne Ebola will cleanse us of the humans and he had a three minute standing ovation according to local papers.
[01:34:41.022 --> 01:34:47.247]  I had some people on that wrote the article and they were crying like, murder everyone, murder!
[01:34:47.807 --> 01:34:52.570]  I mean just a bunch of demon weird academics dreaming about killing people.
[01:34:57.734 --> 01:34:58.995]  You know I could tell you some other stories.
[01:34:59.035 --> 01:35:00.596]  I know somebody that worked at MD Anderson.
[01:35:03.161 --> 01:35:14.400]  And he, he had to stop working there because some of the surgeons would become basically sexually aroused.
[01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:40.497]  When they were injecting people with experimental stuff that they'd signed waiver forms that would probably kill them, and they would get off on killing people, and they'd get off on, like, people missing their lower mandibles who had had, you know, who had signed on for experiments to stay alive, and they would go in there, and there's all these people like a zombie movie with their tongues, you know, basically hanging out drooling, and the doctors would just get off on it and then go basically jerk off in the bathroom after they went and saw it.
[01:35:40.517 --> 01:35:41.857]  I mean, can you imagine
[01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:47.353]  Masturbating to people missing their lower mandibles and their tongues hanging out.
[01:35:48.494 --> 01:35:54.537]  And as soon as you realize that type of psychoscientist is in control, you start turning things around.
[01:35:54.758 --> 01:35:56.919]  So I don't want to tell you stories like this to shock you.
[01:35:57.199 --> 01:36:01.602]  This is the reality.
[01:36:01.622 --> 01:36:03.203]  50 years ago, no kids had cancer.
[01:36:03.443 --> 01:36:04.624]  Now, it's super common.
[01:36:07.892 --> 01:36:09.913]  They're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:36:10.394 --> 01:36:12.895]  They've already been doing DNA vaccines for a while.
[01:36:15.077 --> 01:36:15.937]  They just don't tell you that.
[01:36:16.878 --> 01:36:18.219]  And now they've had big effects.
[01:36:18.699 --> 01:36:20.180]  And so, your kids are dead!
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:29.225]  And I know you'll raise money for them and get attention from the church and everything and then you'll put them in a little coffin and lower them in the ground and do your little liberal high fives.
[01:36:30.426 --> 01:36:32.968]  I'm not talking to our listeners, I'm talking to the scum that go along with this.
[01:36:34.366 --> 01:36:37.227]  And people need to understand you're being exterminated.
[01:36:37.707 --> 01:36:39.408]  And if you don't stand up to it, you deserve it.
[01:36:39.428 --> 01:36:45.270]  All right, let's go to Beth in California, where they have the March Against Pedophiles taking over CNN headquarters.
[01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:46.350]  They have marches all over the country.
[01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:47.311]  We salute you.
[01:36:47.591 --> 01:36:49.331]  Beth, tell us about your view on this.
[01:36:50.652 --> 01:36:51.672]  Hey, Alex.
[01:36:51.812 --> 01:36:52.953]  So good to be on your show.
[01:36:53.173 --> 01:36:54.213]  Exciting to talk to you.
[01:36:54.393 --> 01:36:55.334]  Been listening for years.
[01:36:55.694 --> 01:37:00.816]  Yeah, so I'm part of a start-up, a new
[01:37:02.469 --> 01:37:02.969]  We're good to go.
[01:37:31.599 --> 01:37:39.501]  We did a large march for about three miles downtown, and we even invaded the CNN headquarters and protested.
[01:37:39.521 --> 01:37:43.662]  You can see footage on our Instagram page of the Real Deal Media.
[01:37:45.463 --> 01:37:47.683]  Apparently, a CNN employee let us in.
[01:37:51.061 --> 01:37:52.001]  Exploding.
[01:37:52.341 --> 01:37:54.762]  All over California, we've been having all these marches.
[01:37:55.122 --> 01:37:57.123]  Facebook, Instagram, everybody's been censoring us.
[01:37:57.803 --> 01:38:02.745]  And what's beautiful is, it's people of every race, color, and creed standing up for all our children.
[01:38:03.705 --> 01:38:04.365]  Absolutely.
[01:38:04.645 --> 01:38:05.105]  Absolutely.
[01:38:05.125 --> 01:38:13.888]  I mean, we had anti-Trump people, pro-Trump people in the group, and it was just, you know, this is about the kids, and this is the one issue they cannot divide us on.
[01:38:14.228 --> 01:38:19.910]  We even had 10 LAPD cops escorting us, and they said as long as we stayed peaceful and
[01:38:20.464 --> 01:38:22.028]  And didn't block traffic, we were fine.
[01:38:22.389 --> 01:38:23.091]  I mean, gosh.
[01:38:23.772 --> 01:38:25.436]  I can't even tell you the amount of...
[01:38:26.008 --> 01:38:27.449]  Overwhelming support that we got.
[01:38:27.469 --> 01:38:29.351]  We've had people flying in from Dallas.
[01:38:29.991 --> 01:38:31.993]  Well, I'm glad you're here, so start over.
[01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:32.993]  I do know about your group.
[01:38:33.033 --> 01:38:34.314]  Tell us about who you are again.
[01:38:34.334 --> 01:38:37.016]  They're going to try to censor you, but more people must join you.
[01:38:37.377 --> 01:38:42.300]  Others must, again, launch their own operations, because the AI isn't watching you until you do that.
[01:38:42.681 --> 01:38:44.802]  And then other people have to be the leader, be the leader.
[01:38:45.103 --> 01:38:47.444]  And as they try to suppress one leader, another leader jumps up.
[01:38:47.624 --> 01:38:50.707]  And then soon they're fighting an army of leaders, and they can't stop us.
[01:38:51.673 --> 01:38:54.256]  I mean, we're making it as decentralized as possible.
[01:38:54.376 --> 01:39:02.406]  So our site is ReelDealMedia.com, and you can check us out on Instagram, too, at The ReelDealMedia.
[01:39:02.426 --> 01:39:04.548]  And it's been incredible.
[01:39:04.568 --> 01:39:07.872]  We actually even had Joshua Abraham, who's been on your show.
[01:39:08.533 --> 01:39:11.256]  His father is, I think, Larry Abraham, right?
[01:39:11.276 --> 01:39:11.877]  The guy who wrote
[01:39:12.464 --> 01:39:13.625]  None dare call it a conspiracy.
[01:39:13.665 --> 01:39:14.385]  He came and spoke.
[01:39:14.906 --> 01:39:16.507]  And we're going to do another march.
[01:39:16.567 --> 01:39:18.868]  I mean, it is exploding all over California.
[01:39:18.968 --> 01:39:20.930]  I mean, I've been seeing all through Orange County.
[01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.690]  No, it's beautiful.
[01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:28.414]  We don't want the Soros, Nazi collaborator, kill the black people, eugenics, Planned Parenthood, kill the nuclear family.
[01:39:28.695 --> 01:39:29.575]  Black lives matter.
[01:39:29.615 --> 01:39:30.236]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:39:30.256 --> 01:39:32.917]  That's what's killed black people is destroying their nuclear family.
[01:39:32.977 --> 01:39:33.698]  It kills everybody.
[01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:34.899]  And exactly.
[01:39:34.919 --> 01:39:38.001]  And now just spontaneously, this is exploding everywhere.
[01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:41.483]  As people know the truth, it's got to scare the evil globalist.
[01:39:42.282 --> 01:39:42.642]  Absolutely.
[01:39:42.682 --> 01:39:43.503]  I can't even tell you.
[01:39:43.583 --> 01:39:50.526]  Literally, there was a bunch of different groups, all of us, within about 72 hours, all had planned different protests.
[01:39:50.746 --> 01:39:52.727]  None of us have been talking to each other.
[01:39:52.967 --> 01:39:54.127]  And it's gone viral.
[01:39:54.287 --> 01:39:57.889]  I mean, we had one guy who posted it, had over a million views on Facebook.
[01:39:58.328 --> 01:40:00.330]  And his video was censored.
[01:40:00.851 --> 01:40:04.734]  Well, I would call it, and your movement's great, Children's Lives Matter.
[01:40:05.375 --> 01:40:06.516]  Baby lives matter.
[01:40:07.097 --> 01:40:08.398]  Abused children lives matter.
[01:40:08.618 --> 01:40:10.059]  And that will unify humanity.
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:11.721]  And it's absolutely what has to happen.
[01:40:11.741 --> 01:40:12.282]  That's beautiful.
[01:40:13.202 --> 01:40:13.863]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:13.883 --> 01:40:18.087]  We've got downloadable posters if anybody wants to do any of their own sort of grassroots movement.
[01:40:18.127 --> 01:40:20.810]  We're giving everybody downloadable posters and stickers.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:21.941]  I don't know.
[01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:46.051]  That is the entry point into this entire underbelly of the beast.
[01:40:46.271 --> 01:40:52.692]  Hold on, let's talk about Hollywood and the pedophilia, because that's the currency, it's how they operate, it's what Chef's all about.
[01:40:52.752 --> 01:40:54.752]  I mean, these men are demons.
[01:40:55.472 --> 01:40:57.373]  But they believe they derive this power, and they do.
[01:40:57.413 --> 01:41:01.673]  They suck spiritual energy off the children, and Satan rewards them for it.
[01:41:02.093 --> 01:41:05.874]  They're given power on this planet, but they are sacks of demonic filth.
[01:41:06.274 --> 01:41:06.914]  Stay there, Beth.
[01:41:06.934 --> 01:41:08.295]  We'll be right back with you on the other side.
[01:41:08.555 --> 01:41:10.555]  Pedos in Pedophilewood.
[01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:14.286]  Hashtag Bill Clinton's a pedophile.
[01:41:14.506 --> 01:41:16.287]  Bill Clinton pedophile was trending on Twitter.
[01:41:16.307 --> 01:41:20.709]  They let it trend because they know they're losing control of the people.
[01:41:21.650 --> 01:41:23.390]  These globalists will follow when we lead.
[01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:29.313]  Now I'm going to get to a bunch of your calls, but then I'm going to hit the story that just broke on InfoWars.com that's absolutely true.
[01:41:30.234 --> 01:41:33.215]  This is where this is going and you've seen all the preparation for it.
[01:41:34.556 --> 01:41:41.179]  Globalist election integrity group war games how Biden could seize power even if Trump is reelected.
[01:41:43.237 --> 01:41:43.938]  That's what they're saying.
[01:41:44.078 --> 01:41:45.119]  They're going to challenge it.
[01:41:45.679 --> 01:41:48.461]  And then when Trump challenges them, they're going to say it's illegitimate and remove it.
[01:41:49.362 --> 01:41:59.231]  A bipartisan election integrity group linked to George Soros, Bill Gates, the Chinese Communist Party's war games, several 2020 election scenarios to formulate how to overthrow President Trump.
[01:42:00.352 --> 01:42:01.112]  Debbie's reelected.
[01:42:03.114 --> 01:42:05.416]  The Transition Integrity Project, or TIP.
[01:42:06.297 --> 01:42:07.738]  I'll be telling you about that coming up.
[01:42:09.974 --> 01:42:13.976]  When I say that's a true headline, it captures just how horrible it is.
[01:42:14.337 --> 01:42:15.497]  Like, Kit Daniels is a great guy.
[01:42:15.517 --> 01:42:16.218]  He wrote this story.
[01:42:16.638 --> 01:42:18.479]  I'm going to talk to him during the break and have him change the headline.
[01:42:18.759 --> 01:42:19.740]  It's not bad enough.
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:21.281]  We tend to hold back.
[01:42:21.861 --> 01:42:28.785]  Nursing homes treat elderly as prisoners during extended lockdowns.
[01:42:28.965 --> 01:42:33.648]  Meet America's largest prison population, the elderly.
[01:42:35.353 --> 01:42:37.915]  Families kept away while sick shipped in to kill them.
[01:42:38.015 --> 01:42:40.637]  I mean, it's not that Kit's bad, it's a good article he wrote.
[01:42:40.937 --> 01:42:44.260]  But it's way worse than I can say or he can say.
[01:42:45.201 --> 01:42:48.543]  The magnitude of it, because they've made their move, folks.
[01:42:49.924 --> 01:43:03.275]  And when you talk about the emptiness and the degradation and the soullessness of Hollywood that is the engine of Satan's cult, and all these globalists that are disconnected from God, they all see us as chattel trash.
[01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:10.847]  And the dark force that glues them together, the cement of blood, is the abuse of men, women, and children.
[01:43:11.227 --> 01:43:13.169]  I gotta tell you, it's not just children, it's not just women.
[01:43:13.730 --> 01:43:22.459]  Hollywood, it comes out, everybody talks about men, leading role men, have to get slapped around and their genitals grabbed and raped.
[01:43:24.124 --> 01:43:28.269]  Like they say in Team America, he says to the CIA agent, give me a blowjob.
[01:43:28.289 --> 01:43:29.610]  And he said, I don't want to.
[01:43:29.630 --> 01:43:31.412]  He says, it's not about being gay, Gary.
[01:43:31.873 --> 01:43:32.674]  It's about power.
[01:43:33.255 --> 01:43:36.679]  And they're just showing you about, you're going to wear a mask.
[01:43:36.699 --> 01:43:37.980]  You're going to take an inoculation.
[01:43:38.441 --> 01:43:42.325]  You're going to let me grab your genitals and you're going to get on your knees and you're going to give me a...
[01:43:43.166 --> 01:43:43.727]  You know what?
[01:43:44.027 --> 01:43:44.868]  Or you're fired!
[01:43:45.449 --> 01:43:47.210]  And it's about the power to not get in trouble.
[01:43:47.411 --> 01:43:54.799]  And then that very group starts getting caught with Jeffrey Epstein, so they launch the MeToo movement and tell women to accuse innocent people everywhere.
[01:43:56.195 --> 01:44:05.057]  of stuff to break down society, to cover up the mass scale of how it's their religion to dominate you and to steal your sexual energy.
[01:44:05.957 --> 01:44:07.957]  All the Aleister Crowley crap is about that.
[01:44:08.338 --> 01:44:13.058]  So Beth, just finish up with you being involved with the great groups that are all over the country.
[01:44:13.799 --> 01:44:15.119]  Are there more events planned?
[01:44:15.179 --> 01:44:17.359]  And you live out there, I guess, in LA.
[01:44:17.379 --> 01:44:20.200]  Give us your take on this cult.
[01:44:21.698 --> 01:44:29.784]  So I'm actually in Orange County out towards Laguna Beach, and it has just been a massive movement, especially in Orange County.
[01:44:29.804 --> 01:44:39.392]  We've been the heart of the resistance, you know, 48 hours after Orange County decided to shut down or to revoke the mask rule, Gavin Newsom shut down the whole state.
[01:44:39.452 --> 01:44:44.035]  So you can tell there's just tons of patriots in Orange County, and a bunch of us came up to LA.
[01:44:44.055 --> 01:44:46.777]  I mean, people are coming from all over.
[01:44:46.797 --> 01:44:48.659]  And mind you, this is a limited
[01:44:49.133 --> 01:44:50.855]  I mean, we were getting censored within two days.
[01:44:50.935 --> 01:44:57.060]  General Jameson tweeted about it, and it's just, I'm telling you, it was a natural movement of God.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:06.648]  People are awakening worldwide and doing their own grassroots protests, and it just happened to be within 48 hours, you know, we were finding out people were doing protests the same day.
[01:45:07.249 --> 01:45:13.534]  And I think what's happening is that God has been set up, and I'm telling you, it's so interesting to watch this switch between
[01:45:14.537 --> 01:45:18.100]  You know, non-believers are now coming around and vice versa.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:21.122]  I went to a Christian college and a lot of my friends are now leftists.
[01:45:21.262 --> 01:45:32.291]  And it's just, it's so fascinating to see how God just flips everything on its own head and is just using the most unlikely people to bring about this change.
[01:45:32.511 --> 01:45:39.476]  And I think, you know, our whole motto has been, we're putting Hollywood and the rest of the world on notice for the crimes against children.
[01:45:40.117 --> 01:45:41.778]  And we will be the voice for the voiceless.
[01:45:41.798 --> 01:45:44.320]  And there are plenty, there's just so many people, even
[01:45:45.401 --> 01:45:51.004]  That's right.
[01:45:51.104 --> 01:45:55.347]  They launched the MeToo movement to cover up the pedo-rape movement.
[01:45:55.587 --> 01:45:57.668]  They hoped to smoke screen with that and confuse the two.
[01:45:58.168 --> 01:46:10.275]  And of course, women coming out against abuse, that's important too, but they use it to be synthetic to distract off of that and burn Weinstein and a few others to cover up for Epstein and the Clintons, and it's not working, praise God.
[01:46:11.084 --> 01:46:11.684]  No, it's not.
[01:46:11.784 --> 01:46:14.325]  And Hollywood is just... I mean, that's the entry point.
[01:46:14.405 --> 01:46:23.627]  These Freemasons, all of these secret society groups are giving up Hollywood, I believe, as a sacrifice to continue to hide their own crimes.
[01:46:24.027 --> 01:46:26.968]  I mean, I've been told it's like Pinocchio in Pleasure Island.
[01:46:26.988 --> 01:46:29.649]  They have barges of shit filled with children.
[01:46:30.137 --> 01:46:30.837]  We're good.
[01:46:49.144 --> 01:47:02.718]  Text Mars like 25 years ago was on his radio show and said, and the AP reports, Al Gore's refrigerator broke and fell off the airplane full of blood and Al Gore said, well, I need daily transfusions.
[01:47:03.519 --> 01:47:08.602]  And I know Tex was a good guy, but one time I was at his office, and I said, can I see that?
[01:47:08.662 --> 01:47:10.883]  Because he had this whole library of boxes of clippings.
[01:47:11.283 --> 01:47:18.127]  He went and pulled the AP clipping of Al Gore has a refrigerator filled with blood, and reportedly he drinks it daily.
[01:47:18.587 --> 01:47:20.368]  I mean, these are lunatics!
[01:47:20.928 --> 01:47:21.649]  God bless you, ma'am.
[01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:22.889]  I really appreciate your call, Beth.
[01:47:22.909 --> 01:47:23.510]  Very exciting.
[01:47:23.530 --> 01:47:25.791]  Let's take another call before this segment ends.
[01:47:26.711 --> 01:47:29.913]  Let's talk to Zach in Kentucky.
[01:47:29.933 --> 01:47:30.734]  Zach, thanks for holding.
[01:47:30.754 --> 01:47:31.034]  Go ahead.
[01:47:32.754 --> 01:47:37.035]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to tell you a little bit of my story.
[01:47:37.515 --> 01:47:47.797]  So I went in the Army in 2012, got a bunch of shots at basic training, woke up the next day with migraines and vertigo and such.
[01:47:50.678 --> 01:47:58.439]  Ten months later, I'm out of the Army, 50% disability, then 60, then 70.
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.500]  Now they've kicked me down to about 20.
[01:48:04.086 --> 01:48:05.348]  And all that.
[01:48:05.408 --> 01:48:07.730]  I'm just all that stuff.
[01:48:07.831 --> 01:48:13.577]  Anyway, I'm trying to get a march together in D.C.
[01:48:14.738 --> 01:48:19.524]  about vaccine liability and right to refuse and all that mess.
[01:48:22.113 --> 01:48:27.558]  Well, the famous testing, we always hear about black people being tested on, and it's definitely black people have been again.
[01:48:28.539 --> 01:48:32.003]  The left makes them victims, although they're the ones that did it to them, the very same groups, but it's true.
[01:48:32.603 --> 01:48:34.885]  The troops have been abused just as bad as black people.
[01:48:35.346 --> 01:48:41.111]  And a lot of the troops being black, they have guinea-pigged the troops, they've given experimentally legal vaccines, they gave anthrax shots.
[01:48:41.872 --> 01:48:45.994]  As you know, in three rounds in the last 30 years, you can't kill anthrax.
[01:48:46.394 --> 01:48:47.515]  You can't attenuate it.
[01:48:47.875 --> 01:48:49.336]  So of course it killed a bunch of people.
[01:48:50.036 --> 01:48:51.697]  And it was an illegal vaccine.
[01:48:51.717 --> 01:48:54.398]  It killed animals, most of the animals in the trials.
[01:48:54.918 --> 01:48:57.880]  By the way, the new Bill Gates vaccine, they already secretly tested it.
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:58.340]  It came out.
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:01.161]  It kills almost all the ferrets they tested on.
[01:49:01.381 --> 01:49:02.382]  That's why they skipped animals.
[01:49:03.689 --> 01:49:04.449]  It's so bad.
[01:49:04.549 --> 01:49:05.530]  Humans are tough, folks.
[01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:06.510]  We're very advanced.
[01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:07.810]  We've been around a long time.
[01:49:08.271 --> 01:49:10.351]  And most other animals cannot handle these type of shots.
[01:49:10.411 --> 01:49:10.972]  We're tough.
[01:49:11.492 --> 01:49:14.013]  We are tough, tough, tough.
[01:49:15.513 --> 01:49:17.354]  And I'm sorry to hear that happen to you.
[01:49:17.374 --> 01:49:23.236]  I've got so many people I know that are in the military, including family, who got debilitating diseases from the vaccines they were given.
[01:49:25.683 --> 01:49:26.344]  Hey, it happens.
[01:49:26.404 --> 01:49:30.207]  I'm just trying to get the word out and make sure no one else has it.
[01:49:30.507 --> 01:49:35.991]  Well, how do people get in contact with you if they want to organize some type of Refuse Nick March for these upcoming forced inoculations?
[01:49:37.773 --> 01:49:38.914]  You're going to have to Google it.
[01:49:38.994 --> 01:49:42.897]  I'm search banned on Twitter, but Veterans for Vaccine Liability.
[01:49:44.799 --> 01:49:47.200]  Veterans for Vaccine Liability dot com.
[01:49:48.121 --> 01:49:49.703]  Veterans for Vaccine Liability.
[01:49:49.763 --> 01:49:50.423]  Search that, folks.
[01:49:50.463 --> 01:49:51.424]  You can find Zach in Kentucky.
[01:49:51.784 --> 01:49:52.525]  Join up with this man.
[01:49:52.545 --> 01:49:53.305]  God bless you, sir.
[01:49:53.626 --> 01:49:54.647]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:49:54.667 --> 01:49:55.007]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.462 --> 01:50:02.766]  Yeah, we saw the revolutions of the Industrial Revolution and then the high-tech revolution, but it's been hijacked by evil.
[01:50:04.468 --> 01:50:07.550]  And now, just like Revelation told us, a world government's being established.
[01:50:09.371 --> 01:50:12.814]  We're being told we're obsolete, we're non-essential, we gotta roll over and die.
[01:50:12.834 --> 01:50:18.297]  And we've been told, though, they love us so much they got a shot for us that's gonna make us sick.
[01:50:19.758 --> 01:50:20.379]  We gotta take it.
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:21.800]  For the children.
[01:50:23.755 --> 01:50:26.837]  Even though if you supposedly take it, you're protected, but the fine print says you're not.
[01:50:27.178 --> 01:50:28.599]  But if you took it, why do I got to take it?
[01:50:29.439 --> 01:50:32.281]  You'll be rewarded financially if you submit.
[01:50:33.542 --> 01:50:35.143]  But what's good money if you're dead?
[01:50:36.885 --> 01:50:41.508]  So, they've got to emerge at one point with their soft kill.
[01:50:42.349 --> 01:50:43.029]  Now they're here.
[01:50:43.049 --> 01:50:44.070]  All right, who's been holding the longest?
[01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:46.832]  We're going to move quick now to get everybody ahead of Savannah Hernandez.
[01:50:46.852 --> 01:50:49.134]  Joining us at the start of the next hour, the Gerald Celente takes over.
[01:50:50.114 --> 01:50:52.096]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick in Arizona.
[01:50:52.176 --> 01:50:52.856]  Rick, you're on the air.
[01:50:52.896 --> 01:50:53.437]  Thanks for holding.
[01:50:55.137 --> 01:50:55.597]  Hey, what's up?
[01:50:55.617 --> 01:50:56.658]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:50:56.898 --> 01:50:57.319]  Thank you, sir.
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:03.703]  Uh, I wanted to talk about a few things, and it's got to do with, like, the sex trafficking of the kids and drinking of the babies' blood.
[01:51:03.723 --> 01:51:03.843]  Ugh.
[01:51:05.124 --> 01:51:10.988]  I believe that consciousness oscillates at a frequency and should be verified as a number similar to IQ.
[01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:22.516]  With that being said, I've done ayahuasca ceremonies and I've done all kinds of research myself on, like, mushrooms and just everything, like, egos, personalities,
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.082]  And what's going on in the world right now?
[01:51:26.283 --> 01:51:36.572]  The elite are just like low conscience, like demons and they're possessed and they're drinking off the baby's blood and it's the DMT in it along with the rituals and with everything else.
[01:51:37.284 --> 01:51:41.768]  But when they get ahead of the DMT, it's like the God Force, okay?
[01:51:41.788 --> 01:51:42.608]  That's a no-no.
[01:51:43.149 --> 01:51:51.015]  If I go and do it, I can go do it through ayahuasca or smoke it, but the dudes in the jungle were like, dude, that's an abomination.
[01:51:51.495 --> 01:51:57.360]  They told Terrence McKinnon when he showed up with the powder, the smoke, like, oh my God, you can't do this.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.623]  You gotta drink it through the vine and you purge the demons out.
[01:52:02.256 --> 01:52:02.957]  I don't know.
[01:52:15.512 --> 01:52:39.780]  Well, there's no doubt, and Hunter S. Thompson wrote about this, and it was later confirmed that it really was a lawyer that represented the Satanists, and that he really did give them the concentrated essence of a child's blood, and the Clintons are involved owning one of the patents on the EpiPens, and it actually calls it adrenochrome on there, and that's patented.
[01:52:40.945 --> 01:52:47.107]  Even though adrenochrome is also the drug name that Satanists have for the blood concentrated out of the adrenals of children.
[01:52:47.127 --> 01:52:48.588]  They also eat the pituitary glands.
[01:52:49.188 --> 01:52:50.969]  And all of this is coming out, folks.
[01:52:51.709 --> 01:52:55.931]  Imagine, you're billionaires, you're into all this, and that's why you've got Peter Thiel and others.
[01:52:55.971 --> 01:52:58.692]  He's trying to make it mainline and get people to sign on.
[01:52:58.712 --> 01:53:01.853]  Their kids sign waivers and an eight-year-old gives blood and then the elites get it that way.
[01:53:01.873 --> 01:53:03.494]  At least they're not grabbing kids off the street.
[01:53:03.534 --> 01:53:04.994]  But it's all vampirism.
[01:53:05.354 --> 01:53:06.455]  I appreciate your call, Rick.
[01:53:07.352 --> 01:53:09.093]  By the way, for your new listener, I'm talking about all this.
[01:53:09.353 --> 01:53:10.654]  I promise you we're not making it up.
[01:53:10.814 --> 01:53:12.895]  I'm sorry that it sounds so crazy.
[01:53:13.775 --> 01:53:14.735]  Let's take another call.
[01:53:17.137 --> 01:53:21.419]  Let's go ahead and talk to Danny in West Virginia.
[01:53:21.459 --> 01:53:22.039]  Welcome, sir.
[01:53:22.059 --> 01:53:24.340]  Hey Alex.
[01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:30.173]  Hey, uh, just real quick before I get to my point.
[01:53:30.493 --> 01:53:34.757]  If Austin and Texas ever get too liberal for you, West Virginia would be glad to have you.
[01:53:35.037 --> 01:53:35.738]  We're shaped like them.
[01:53:35.778 --> 01:53:38.360]  Well, I've only been to West Virginia once and boy is it pretty.
[01:53:40.442 --> 01:53:40.922]  I love it.
[01:53:41.463 --> 01:53:44.165]  But, uh, the point I'm wanting to make is about the election.
[01:53:44.586 --> 01:53:49.310]  Since, you know, 2016, the Democrats have been talking, you know, Trump's illegitimate.
[01:53:49.890 --> 01:53:50.511]  He cheated.
[01:53:51.596 --> 01:53:54.278]  Used Russia, colluded, all this other stuff.
[01:53:54.558 --> 01:53:57.080]  And the other day I saw a thing where Biden was talking.
[01:53:58.061 --> 01:54:05.286]  And, uh, what I think they're going to do with these mail-in ballots is switch it around and make it so they cheat to have Trump win.
[01:54:05.306 --> 01:54:11.610]  That way they have an excuse to go in, say he did cheat through the mail-in ballots.
[01:54:11.630 --> 01:54:12.651]  Well, it's funny you say that.
[01:54:12.711 --> 01:54:14.432]  That's what there's... They're going to do it either way.
[01:54:14.653 --> 01:54:15.693]  They're now saying that, sir.
[01:54:17.495 --> 01:54:17.655]  So...
[01:54:18.635 --> 01:54:20.996]  So when did you think of that?
[01:54:21.056 --> 01:54:21.876]  Read the news article?
[01:54:21.896 --> 01:54:23.037]  Wake up in the middle of the night?
[01:54:23.057 --> 01:54:23.917]  Because that's very astute.
[01:54:24.177 --> 01:54:25.578]  They're going to challenge you one way or the other.
[01:54:26.858 --> 01:54:30.960]  It's been on my mind for a couple weeks, but I just haven't had a chance to get in to call you about it.
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:32.760]  I sent you an email about it.
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:33.801]  Well, the article's up now.
[01:54:33.821 --> 01:54:39.843]  They're officially saying Globalist Election Integrity Group, war games, how Biden could seize power even if Trump re-elected.
[01:54:42.264 --> 01:54:47.266]  Well, West Virginia's shaped like a middle finger for a reason, so I'd like to see him try something here.
[01:54:48.599 --> 01:54:50.299]  Well, they're telling us everybody's turned on Trump.
[01:54:50.319 --> 01:54:51.040]  I don't think that's true.
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:51.660]  What are you seeing?
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:53.860]  No, no.
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:56.781]  Everywhere I go down here, it's Trump flags.
[01:54:57.001 --> 01:55:00.622]  Especially in the southern part where I'm at.
[01:55:00.842 --> 01:55:02.082]  It's Trump country down here.
[01:55:03.122 --> 01:55:04.062]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[01:55:04.142 --> 01:55:04.802]  Thank you for calling.
[01:55:05.302 --> 01:55:06.863]  All right, let's go to the next caller here.
[01:55:06.883 --> 01:55:07.923]  Get everybody on board.
[01:55:09.143 --> 01:55:10.664]  Let's go to Neil in Missouri.
[01:55:10.704 --> 01:55:11.944]  Neil from the Show-Me State.
[01:55:12.004 --> 01:55:12.304]  Welcome.
[01:55:13.924 --> 01:55:14.164]  Yes.
[01:55:14.804 --> 01:55:15.485]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:55:15.625 --> 01:55:16.125]  I can, sir.
[01:55:17.125 --> 01:55:17.425]  Okay.
[01:55:18.626 --> 01:55:20.568]  If you're going to take the country back, there's only one way to do it.
[01:55:20.668 --> 01:55:22.209]  You've got to get the title to your real estate.
[01:55:22.349 --> 01:55:26.253]  If you have a deed on your piece of property, you can legally claim the patent on it.
[01:55:26.913 --> 01:55:29.255]  Now you have to write to the Secretary of the Interior of the United States.
[01:55:29.435 --> 01:55:31.037]  So you've got to get a loyal title, right?
[01:55:32.057 --> 01:55:32.238]  Right.
[01:55:32.378 --> 01:55:33.018]  That's the patent.
[01:55:33.138 --> 01:55:35.320]  Now the only state that issues their own titles is Texas.
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:37.362]  That's because Texas real estate was never U.S.
[01:55:37.422 --> 01:55:38.303]  government property.
[01:55:38.863 --> 01:55:39.864]  And everything else in the U.S.
[01:55:39.984 --> 01:55:40.745]  You're really smart.
[01:55:40.785 --> 01:55:42.687]  That's why it's called the Lone Star State.
[01:55:43.007 --> 01:55:44.208]  It came in as an equal country.
[01:55:45.208 --> 01:55:45.408]  Right.
[01:55:45.508 --> 01:55:46.089]  It's a treaty state.
[01:55:46.129 --> 01:55:47.730]  It's the only treaty state in the United States.
[01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:50.973]  All the rest of the states were acquired by conquest or Percus.
[01:55:51.934 --> 01:55:56.999]  So, being the only treaty state, it was its own country before it became a state, it issued its own patent.
[01:55:57.459 --> 01:55:59.281]  And you have to go to the Texas land.
[01:55:59.681 --> 01:56:05.567]  And that's why it's still allowed to pull out if it wants to, and the federal government would have no recourse like they did in the Civil War to try to take us.
[01:56:05.867 --> 01:56:08.930]  That's why it was illegal what they did in the Civil War to Texas.
[01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:10.912]  No matter what side you're on in the war, it was illegal.
[01:56:12.088 --> 01:56:15.370]  Right, because they were their own country to start with.
[01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:16.371]  They were never U.S.
[01:56:16.391 --> 01:56:19.893]  government property, whereas all the rest of the states were before they became states.
[01:56:20.854 --> 01:56:21.855]  But you have to get the patent.
[01:56:22.055 --> 01:56:25.277]  If you're in any state but Texas, you have to apply to the Secretary of the Interior.
[01:56:25.297 --> 01:56:31.341]  And that's why we have Homestead, all these lawyers and people, it's the only state where they really cannot take your property.
[01:56:31.581 --> 01:56:33.383]  Others have similar things, but Texas is the best.
[01:56:34.964 --> 01:56:35.164]  Right.
[01:56:35.424 --> 01:56:39.587]  But still, if you have the patent, you become sovereign over that piece of real estate.
[01:56:40.683 --> 01:56:42.484]  And you don't have to pay any real estate taxes on it.
[01:56:42.504 --> 01:56:45.425]  That's why they don't want you to know about the patent, because the patent is the title.
[01:56:45.806 --> 01:56:48.287]  A deed simply proves right of possession.
[01:56:48.407 --> 01:56:49.708]  It is not ownership.
[01:56:50.408 --> 01:56:50.768]  That's right.
[01:56:50.828 --> 01:56:54.310]  It proves a license to be on it, but it sees you as a renter.
[01:56:55.711 --> 01:56:55.891]  Right.
[01:56:55.991 --> 01:56:56.411]  Basically.
[01:56:56.711 --> 01:56:58.352]  You're just renting the property.
[01:56:58.412 --> 01:57:00.373]  You get to keep it as long as you pay the taxes on it.
[01:57:00.993 --> 01:57:04.015]  But if you don't want to pay the taxes, you've got to get that patent recorded in your name.
[01:57:04.575 --> 01:57:10.438]  And the state of Missouri has a statute that specifically says recorders in this state are required
[01:57:10.779 --> 01:57:11.160]  We're good.
[01:57:20.546 --> 01:57:22.207]  So there's a procedure.
[01:57:22.247 --> 01:57:22.608]  That's right.
[01:57:22.628 --> 01:57:34.417]  We have a copy in some old family Bible, it's falling apart, about the land patent we got from Mexico, but it actually says from Spain, because the Mexicans extended the patent from Spain that they were given.
[01:57:34.437 --> 01:57:39.621]  And then that was a guy before Santa Ana to my dad's side of the family in East Texas.
[01:57:39.641 --> 01:57:48.627]  That's pretty wild when you actually see that extending the right from the, I think it was the Queen of Spain at the time, through to the Mexicans and through the Texians.
[01:57:48.667 --> 01:57:49.188]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:57:50.413 --> 01:57:51.173]  Right, right.
[01:57:51.273 --> 01:57:58.136]  Now those patents under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, all those patents have to be honored by the U.S.
[01:57:58.176 --> 01:57:58.476]  government.
[01:57:58.976 --> 01:58:03.577]  And by the way, isn't it funny they just honored the Oklahoma deal even though it was never enforced.
[01:58:04.058 --> 01:58:09.039]  So now it's weird they're actually going back and honoring even that tribal land up in Oklahoma.
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:12.781]  Now I don't know if tribal lands are patented.
[01:58:13.301 --> 01:58:14.281]  That was treaty land.
[01:58:14.301 --> 01:58:16.862]  I understand it's treaty, but I'm saying why do you think they're agreeing with that?
[01:58:19.822 --> 01:58:23.884]  But a treaty is still an agreement with the so-called sovereign power, so that would be kind of the same thing.
[01:58:24.825 --> 01:58:29.467]  But what's happened is the people in Oklahoma don't hold the patents on the real estate.
[01:58:30.127 --> 01:58:35.230]  If all they have is a deed, the Indians are coming in and saying, by treaty, we have a superior right to claim the land.
[01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:36.130]  No, that's why I brought it up.
[01:58:36.150 --> 01:58:37.291]  That's exactly what's happening.
[01:58:37.711 --> 01:58:42.093]  And if you don't get your patent on that place, it's going to be taken away from you.
[01:58:43.153 --> 01:58:47.394]  And again, they try to have the courts ignore this through their own ignorance, but it is real if it's done right.
[01:58:47.794 --> 01:58:48.595]  Very interesting.
[01:58:48.615 --> 01:58:49.415]  Neil, anything else?
[01:58:50.875 --> 01:58:51.796]  No, basically that's it.
[01:58:51.956 --> 01:58:53.116]  People need to research this.
[01:58:53.136 --> 01:58:58.298]  You know, the information, start with Suma Corporation versus California.
[01:58:58.318 --> 01:58:58.878]  Look up the U.S.
[01:58:58.898 --> 01:59:00.518]  Supreme Court decision dealing with land patents.
[01:59:01.399 --> 01:59:03.899]  You know, because it'll give you information.
[01:59:03.939 --> 01:59:08.521]  But if you want the patent on your property, you have to send $15 for a certified copy to the U.S.
[01:59:08.841 --> 01:59:09.701]  Secretary of Interior.
[01:59:10.319 --> 01:59:20.266]  He will send you a certified copy which you then file in your county courthouse stating that you are now holder in due course of that patent as it applies, as it's described in the deed on your real estate.
[01:59:21.467 --> 01:59:21.847]  All right.
[01:59:22.447 --> 01:59:23.088]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:23.128 --> 01:59:23.588]  Thank you, Neal.
[01:59:23.608 --> 01:59:24.028]  Stay with us.
[01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:27.331]  Collar talking about West Virginia, man.
[01:59:27.351 --> 01:59:28.191]  I mean, think of this song.
[01:59:31.534 --> 01:59:33.195]  Thinking about East Texas and my family.
[01:59:33.895 --> 01:59:34.956]  Central Texas, my family.
[01:59:35.957 --> 01:59:37.538]  Watch Texas turn blue is a sad thing.
[01:59:39.195 --> 01:59:41.776]  All the needles, all the feces, all the devil worshippers.
[01:59:42.917 --> 01:59:45.018]  We'll continue with your calls right now and finish up with those.
[01:59:45.038 --> 01:59:46.918]  Savannah Hernandez has been riding shotgun with us for a while.
[01:59:47.299 --> 01:59:50.420]  She did a great job with the rest of the crew this weekend covering things that are just so crazy.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:52.761]  I haven't even really talked about it much since it happened.
[01:59:52.801 --> 01:59:55.522]  Gun trucks, snipers, insanity.
[01:59:55.782 --> 01:59:59.764]  Here's so-called BLM, who's almost always mainly white.
[02:00:00.404 --> 02:00:03.326]  It's George Soros saying he represents black people, so don't criticize him.
[02:00:03.826 --> 02:00:04.526]  That's his shield.
[02:00:05.126 --> 02:00:08.808]  At a restaurant screaming at folks on South Congress, Savannah Hernandez reported on it.
[02:00:11.846 --> 02:00:13.587]  You are a problem!
[02:00:14.388 --> 02:00:15.489]  He's actually got a black guy there.
[02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:16.150]  That's rare.
[02:00:16.810 --> 02:00:17.531]  It's f****** funny.
[02:00:18.431 --> 02:00:19.252]  Hey, hey, hey.
[02:00:19.352 --> 02:00:20.053]  Look at him, man.
[02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:20.913]  Hey, hey, hey.
[02:00:20.933 --> 02:00:23.596]  Imagine screaming at people while they eat dinner for no reason.
[02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:24.316]  Look at me, man.
[02:00:24.656 --> 02:00:27.119]  Hey, you want to f****** look at me, but you want to f****** laugh at me.
[02:00:27.139 --> 02:00:28.840]  Notice he's not wearing his mask.
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:29.861]  Yeah.
[02:00:30.141 --> 02:00:30.541]  Yeah.
[02:00:30.681 --> 02:00:31.682]  Yeah.
[02:00:31.722 --> 02:00:32.863]  Don't f****** laugh, boy.
[02:00:32.903 --> 02:00:34.224]  This little guy's got a man bun.
[02:00:34.284 --> 02:00:36.006]  Leave him alone.
[02:00:36.546 --> 02:00:39.148]  We're going to see what f****** is going to happen, boy.
[02:00:41.291 --> 02:00:43.672]  These are the lunatics Soros has hired.
[02:00:46.993 --> 02:00:53.375]  You imagine randomly starting fights with people.
[02:00:54.155 --> 02:00:59.197]  Savannah, you were down there for days watching the craziness.
[02:00:59.257 --> 02:01:01.018]  How would you describe it?
[02:01:11.343 --> 02:01:19.726]  You know Alex, actually I was expecting it to be crazier, but the APD did a really great job and state troopers did a really great job of dispersing the crowds.
[02:01:19.766 --> 02:01:20.966]  So they didn't stand down this time?
[02:01:21.126 --> 02:01:22.227]  No, they didn't stand down at all.
[02:01:22.247 --> 02:01:23.607]  They didn't let them block roads and aim guns at people?
[02:01:23.627 --> 02:01:24.207]  No, they did not.
[02:01:24.227 --> 02:01:26.128]  They dispersed crowds really quickly.
[02:01:26.528 --> 02:01:28.089]  And Antifa just seemed very weak.
[02:01:28.169 --> 02:01:29.509]  BLM seemed very weak.
[02:01:29.609 --> 02:01:31.550]  All they did was infighting the whole night.
[02:01:31.590 --> 02:01:33.670]  It was hysterical to watch.
[02:01:33.710 --> 02:01:35.471]  We're going to play some of that next hour.
[02:01:35.771 --> 02:01:38.312]  You know, it was just a big, it was infighting all night long.
[02:01:38.352 --> 02:01:39.452]  They were screaming at each other.
[02:01:39.472 --> 02:01:42.573]  They were calling each other like rapists and attackers.
[02:01:42.693 --> 02:01:49.115]  And so inside of their own group, they couldn't even figure out which way to go because that's how much infighting there was.
[02:01:49.135 --> 02:01:50.255]  There was two separate leaders.
[02:01:50.315 --> 02:01:52.356]  It was that guy that we just showed, this other girl.
[02:01:52.676 --> 02:01:54.456]  And they were saying, go two different ways.
[02:01:54.536 --> 02:01:56.217]  Someone was saying, overtake the highway.
[02:01:56.297 --> 02:01:57.997]  Someone was saying, don't overtake the highway.
[02:01:58.317 --> 02:01:59.538]  So it was just so comical.
[02:01:59.558 --> 02:02:00.838]  They had no idea what they were doing.
[02:02:01.018 --> 02:02:04.200]  And there was a white girl yelling at the black guy going, we've got to be violent.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:05.181]  He's like, no.
[02:02:05.201 --> 02:02:06.522]  And she's like, you're a coward.
[02:02:06.602 --> 02:02:07.443]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:02:07.503 --> 02:02:08.303]  It's ridiculous.
[02:02:08.343 --> 02:02:11.005]  They had no idea what they were doing the whole entire night.
[02:02:11.445 --> 02:02:20.392]  And like I said, Alex, I think, you know, they were talking about making an autonomous zone, having militarized people there in trucks, on snipers, on roofs.
[02:02:20.692 --> 02:02:22.493]  But they really, none of that really materialized.
[02:02:22.533 --> 02:02:24.414]  Well, they had the trucks driving around.
[02:02:24.434 --> 02:02:25.235]  They did have them.
[02:02:25.515 --> 02:02:26.136]  They did have them.
[02:02:26.156 --> 02:02:27.977]  But the police this time didn't let them block roads.
[02:02:28.157 --> 02:02:30.981]  Yeah, the police really took control of the situation.
[02:02:31.362 --> 02:02:33.264]  So we didn't see any autonomous zones created.
[02:02:33.304 --> 02:02:38.572]  We didn't really see any roads being overtaken for too long of a period of time because the police were very quick.
[02:02:38.993 --> 02:02:39.734]  Look at these guys!
[02:02:39.814 --> 02:02:40.555]  Getting this done.
[02:02:40.675 --> 02:02:43.058]  They all look like mama didn't give them too much attention.
[02:02:43.806 --> 02:02:44.807]  It was hilarious Alex.
[02:02:44.827 --> 02:02:47.530]  Beta cucks wearing like US military outfits.
[02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:52.454]  And you know I think this night I had the most security that I've ever gone out with and I didn't even need it.
[02:02:52.955 --> 02:02:55.517]  Because that's how weak and fragile all of these people were.
[02:02:55.578 --> 02:02:56.518]  They were fighting with each other.
[02:02:56.538 --> 02:02:58.701]  There was also a lot of just regular citizens showed up.
[02:02:59.517 --> 02:02:59.817]  They did.
[02:03:00.177 --> 02:03:05.581]  And I felt really bad too because there were people eating, you know, on the side of the road there on the restaurant.
[02:03:06.681 --> 02:03:10.964]  There were people for bachelorette parties and they were just watching all of this unfold.
[02:03:10.984 --> 02:03:17.108]  Can you imagine tourists come to town and there's like probably 800 police and like maybe 500 antifa trying to burn things down?
[02:03:17.148 --> 02:03:17.288]  I mean...
[02:03:18.214 --> 02:03:20.076]  Exactly, that's exactly what we were seeing.
[02:03:20.156 --> 02:03:23.859]  But overall Alex, it wasn't as eventful as I thought it was going to be.
[02:03:24.279 --> 02:03:30.184]  APD did a really great job of dispersing the crowd, like I said, and they just had a very weak show of force.
[02:03:31.065 --> 02:03:34.948]  Antifa is going to be continuing demonstrations here in Austin, Texas.
[02:03:34.988 --> 02:03:38.932]  I think they're going to be out in front of Travis County Jail later tonight to protest.
[02:03:39.132 --> 02:03:42.715]  That's right, they can demonstrate all they want, they just can't burn down the police stations they said they were going to do.
[02:03:42.915 --> 02:03:43.175]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:43.195 --> 02:03:45.277]  Fireball and then burn down the homeless camp and blame it on us.
[02:03:45.557 --> 02:03:47.739]  We're going to take calls and get into those clips with you next hour.
[02:03:47.759 --> 02:03:50.861]  Savannah Hernandez taking calls with us here, one of the co-hosts here.
[02:03:51.282 --> 02:03:51.802]  Great reporter.
[02:03:51.822 --> 02:03:54.224]  You'll find all her work and Savannah Hernandez at Band.Video.
[02:03:54.624 --> 02:03:57.346]  Clay in Hawaii under massive lockdown.
[02:03:57.647 --> 02:03:59.708]  You guys are just as bad, it looks like, as Australia.
[02:04:00.028 --> 02:04:01.750]  What's going on in Hawaii, Clay?
[02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:05.393]  Well, you know, they're not letting people come, Alex.
[02:04:05.493 --> 02:04:09.776]  It's 14-day quarantine if you get here, and they're not planning on opening us up for two more months.
[02:04:09.996 --> 02:04:10.537]  It's all BS.
[02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:11.778]  But anyway.
[02:04:12.851 --> 02:04:14.012]  It's always two months, too.
[02:04:14.052 --> 02:04:15.714]  It's always two more months, two more months.
[02:04:15.734 --> 02:04:16.714]  They're never going to let you open.
[02:04:16.975 --> 02:04:17.455]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:17.595 --> 02:04:18.576]  No, they're never going to.
[02:04:19.897 --> 02:04:24.901]  Alex, I want to thank you, the crew, Savannah, everybody for fighting for my family.
[02:04:25.461 --> 02:04:26.122]  I appreciate you.
[02:04:26.142 --> 02:04:27.483]  We appreciate you, brother.
[02:04:28.484 --> 02:04:34.909]  Anyway, my idea is we need to flip this damn script with this whole shutdown of business and stuff.
[02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:37.371]  All the small businesses right now are hurting.
[02:04:37.912 --> 02:04:39.573]  If they just would turn it around and say,
[02:04:40.316 --> 02:04:42.598]  We don't serve you unless you come in without a mask.
[02:04:43.358 --> 02:04:44.899]  They can't enforce that.
[02:04:45.099 --> 02:04:51.303]  If we all start going to business... Sure, it took them a month to enforce on the group in New Jersey with their gym.
[02:04:51.344 --> 02:04:53.105]  They just kicked it down and now they're heroes.
[02:04:53.565 --> 02:04:55.206]  It's time to start saying no.
[02:04:55.306 --> 02:04:56.247]  Stop living on our knees.
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:57.581]  Business owners.
[02:04:57.801 --> 02:05:00.945]  I'm not a business owner, but if I had a business, that would be my thing.
[02:05:00.985 --> 02:05:03.228]  I would go out and I'd say, I'm not doing this.
[02:05:03.569 --> 02:05:05.551]  Come and do stuff to me if you want.
[02:05:06.092 --> 02:05:07.534]  There's a lady in our little community.
[02:05:07.554 --> 02:05:09.616]  We're in Ocean View, Hawaii, which is South Dakota.
[02:05:10.097 --> 02:05:11.459]  She got two $5,000 fines.
[02:05:12.910 --> 02:05:15.251]  Yeah, because you can't let the big stores stay open and little ones can't.
[02:05:15.271 --> 02:05:16.391]  It's discriminatory.
[02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:31.341]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:05:31.381 --> 02:05:32.081]  And that's the thing, too.
[02:05:32.121 --> 02:05:33.282]  People need to start standing up.
[02:05:33.523 --> 02:05:38.387]  We've seen so many people complaining about how they can't go visit their families, how they can't open up their businesses.
[02:05:38.567 --> 02:05:41.650]  Well, people just need to do it, and people need to realize that they can do it.
[02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:44.652]  They have the ability to do it, but everyone's just scared to stand up right now.
[02:05:44.672 --> 02:05:48.516]  But that's what needs to be done, because the government is never going to let us reopen or get back to normal.
[02:05:48.536 --> 02:05:49.537]  The special interests, no.
[02:05:49.577 --> 02:05:56.343]  The Federal Reserve had said, we've got to keep the economy closed a second lockdown to save the economy.
[02:05:57.017 --> 02:05:59.738]  That's like, again, we've got to shoot you in the head so you don't bleed to death.
[02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:00.619]  It's BS.
[02:06:00.639 --> 02:06:01.459]  God bless you, Clay.
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:02.700]  Thank you so much.
[02:06:04.861 --> 02:06:06.982]  All right, let's talk to Mary and then Henry.
[02:06:07.382 --> 02:06:08.623]  Mary in Arizona.
[02:06:08.823 --> 02:06:09.183]  Welcome.
[02:06:09.203 --> 02:06:09.564]  Thank you.
[02:06:10.784 --> 02:06:11.064]  Hi.
[02:06:11.244 --> 02:06:13.185]  It's a pleasure to speak with you, Alex.
[02:06:13.266 --> 02:06:14.166]  I hope you can hear me.
[02:06:14.186 --> 02:06:14.406]  I can.
[02:06:14.426 --> 02:06:15.046]  Thank you.
[02:06:16.007 --> 02:06:16.667]  Thank you.
[02:06:16.847 --> 02:06:17.848]  No, thank you.
[02:06:18.868 --> 02:06:23.671]  I always tell some of my closest friends that I channel Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.215 --> 02:06:28.878]  Because when they hear me talk, they look at me and go, look, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:06:29.398 --> 02:06:31.840]  I said he will have documents to prove what he's saying.
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:44.808]  But I wanted to say that here in Arizona, we have a supposed Republican governor and he was in a lawsuit against a really good gym owner.
[02:06:45.508 --> 02:06:51.652]  And yet there's a website, a guy named Dave Hodges here in Phoenix.
[02:06:52.298 --> 02:06:53.940]  You know, I forgot the Common Sense Show.
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:57.125]  Don't they publish a local newspaper or something?
[02:07:09.864 --> 02:07:12.706]  No, it's a website, and his name is Dave Hodges.
[02:07:12.806 --> 02:07:13.886]  No, we should get him back on.
[02:07:13.906 --> 02:07:15.427]  I've been on his show years ago, Memory Serves.
[02:07:15.447 --> 02:07:23.472]  But yeah, all these people, Fauci, the governor of California, American Psycho, none of them wear the mask.
[02:07:23.532 --> 02:07:31.897]  It's all an act of your submission to get us fighting with each other, and then they keep the beaches closed, the parks closed, to make us as miserable as possible.
[02:07:31.917 --> 02:07:39.481]  The thing is that Dave Hodges, since June the 12th, he's been attacked six times.
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:41.741]  Um, someone went up to his home.
[02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:44.682]  He lives way out in this unincorporated part of the desert.
[02:07:45.142 --> 02:07:52.046]  And he put it on his website, um, how, so this guy came up, um, pretending to talk about health insurance.
[02:07:52.566 --> 02:07:55.427]  Nobody goes knocking on the door talking about health insurance.
[02:07:55.948 --> 02:07:59.649]  But there was a look about the guy who's really dangerous, but he was not alone.
[02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:04.852]  There's another... Yeah, I know, we're seeing mafia tactics, so am I, and we're not gonna back down.
[02:08:04.892 --> 02:08:06.473]  We, you know, the fine, you wanna fight, you got one.
[02:08:07.290 --> 02:08:11.156]  Everybody's got to start carrying firearms and somebody tries to hurt you, defend yourself.
[02:08:11.216 --> 02:08:14.681]  The left are a global mafia that knows they're losing America.
[02:08:14.701 --> 02:08:16.163]  If they lose America, they lose the world.
[02:08:17.525 --> 02:08:18.647]  And they believe they own us.
[02:08:18.687 --> 02:08:19.708]  Thank you so much, Mary.
[02:08:19.969 --> 02:08:20.690]  What do you think, Savannah?
[02:08:21.414 --> 02:08:22.554]  I completely agree, Alex.
[02:08:22.614 --> 02:08:28.757]  And you know, just living through this whole entire coronavirus pandemic that has been going on in America has been such a crazy thing.
[02:08:28.777 --> 02:08:29.617]  Because you know what, Alex?
[02:08:30.037 --> 02:08:37.200]  Since all of these shutdowns have began, too, with the grocery stores and the face mask ordinance here in Austin, I have never worn a face mask to go grocery shopping.
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:38.641]  To this day, I still haven't.
[02:08:38.881 --> 02:08:40.681]  And people don't come up to me and they don't say anything.
[02:08:41.001 --> 02:08:44.083]  And people don't realize that you can go grocery shopping without a face mask.
[02:08:44.283 --> 02:08:45.543]  You can open your small business.
[02:08:45.563 --> 02:08:47.484]  Because if they're wearing one, they're supposedly protected.
[02:08:47.944 --> 02:08:58.027]  Exactly Alex, you don't have to do it, but people think people are submitting so much to the government that they've changed their whole lives and they're willing to give up their freedom for safety basically.
[02:08:58.247 --> 02:09:01.147]  They don't realize that you can go and you can live your normal life.
[02:09:01.167 --> 02:09:04.868]  Well they're being herded into forced inoculations, contact tracers in their house.
[02:09:05.268 --> 02:09:07.209]  Their submission is conjuring the demon.
[02:09:07.629 --> 02:09:08.150]  Exactly.
[02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:11.014]  Savannah Hernandez is in studio with us.
[02:09:11.395 --> 02:09:12.356]  Hour number four.
[02:09:12.717 --> 02:09:17.725]  We'll jam in a few more calls, then get to Antifa in Austin, then Gerald Celente takes over.
[02:09:18.926 --> 02:09:21.610]  You know, Benny's got a really good point, Savannah Hernandez.
[02:09:23.376 --> 02:09:25.617]  Will Trump usher in the COVID-19 vaccine?
[02:09:27.197 --> 02:09:28.378]  He's been attacking Fauci.
[02:09:28.418 --> 02:09:34.480]  He said we don't have to take the vaccine previously, but he wants to have this hope to boost the stock market, which he knows they're trying to target.
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:36.881]  That was the big subject I said I'd cover today that I forgot.
[02:09:36.901 --> 02:09:38.902]  They're trying to plunge the dollar.
[02:09:39.162 --> 02:09:40.062]  It's total treason.
[02:09:40.583 --> 02:09:41.723]  I'll explain it at another date.
[02:09:42.343 --> 02:09:44.904]  Obviously, the whole world's a bunch of currencies that have been inflated.
[02:09:45.244 --> 02:09:47.685]  We want ours to come out on top or we're done.
[02:09:50.293 --> 02:09:54.414]  He's bringing up the fact, Benny, is that will Trump usher in the COVID-19 vaccine?
[02:09:55.575 --> 02:10:05.999]  If it actually comes out, and if they're trying to cover up the side effects, which they're not even doing right now, and if Trump really tries to ever force us to take it, then I'll come out against Trump.
[02:10:06.019 --> 02:10:06.639]  Savannah, what do you say?
[02:10:07.563 --> 02:10:08.003]  I agree.
[02:10:08.103 --> 02:10:11.406]  I know he previously said that they're voluntary, not mandatory.
[02:10:11.466 --> 02:10:12.686]  So I hope that he sticks to that.
[02:10:13.007 --> 02:10:19.771]  But, you know, more importantly, I think the big push that we're going to have to fight back against is schools saying your child can't come unless they're vaccinated.
[02:10:19.991 --> 02:10:22.373]  It's going to be the corporations that implement it.
[02:10:22.393 --> 02:10:23.434]  That's how it's going to happen.
[02:10:23.494 --> 02:10:25.555]  It's not going to be Trump, but it's going to be the corporation.
[02:10:25.595 --> 02:10:27.576]  So we're still going to say no to that.
[02:10:27.696 --> 02:10:28.837]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:10:28.897 --> 02:10:36.382]  We need him to fight for us so we aren't forced to take these vaccines while being barred from being able to go again, grocery shopping, just like with the face masks.
[02:10:36.462 --> 02:10:37.223]  That was basically.
[02:10:37.523 --> 02:10:38.584]  I bet it's an act of submission.
[02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:45.931]  Why do you think Gates and them are being so honest that 100% are getting sick taking it, 20% going to hospitals, because they can't hide it anymore?
[02:10:45.951 --> 02:10:46.691]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:10:46.951 --> 02:10:47.992]  Like, this product's really great.
[02:10:48.012 --> 02:10:49.073]  I'm going to have liability protection.
[02:10:49.314 --> 02:10:51.295]  It doesn't really protect you, and it's going to make you sick.
[02:10:51.315 --> 02:10:52.076]  Don't you want it, Savannah?
[02:10:52.376 --> 02:10:53.077]  Well, that's the thing, Alex.
[02:10:53.397 --> 02:10:58.740]  They realize that nobody is paying attention, that they can come out and say the point-blank truth about vaccines.
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:05.164]  We even had the World Health Organization themselves come forward and say that they don't really know how vaccines work in our bodies and if they're safe or not.
[02:11:05.564 --> 02:11:11.148]  But they're able to tell these truths because people aren't paying attention and people are willing to submit their authority.
[02:11:11.168 --> 02:11:15.450]  Exactly, it's fine print so people shouldn't celebrate, hey the UN admits it's all BS and deadly!
[02:11:15.710 --> 02:11:20.013]  No, they're fine printing your ass so that they don't have liability when you're dumb enough to take it.
[02:11:20.473 --> 02:11:21.253]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:11:21.293 --> 02:11:35.718]  So, until we wake people up, until each individual person is willing to wake up and fight for themselves, I mean, there really isn't much we can do for the masses at this point because they're willing to submit to authority and this whole COVID pandemic has just been a blatant example.
[02:11:35.758 --> 02:11:37.238]  It's a litmus test to being a slave.
[02:11:37.338 --> 02:11:38.819]  Benny and Georgia, your points on this.
[02:11:40.999 --> 02:11:41.560]  Hey, hello.
[02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:42.420]  Yes, sir, Benny.
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:43.560]  So, what's your take on this?
[02:11:46.405 --> 02:11:50.106]  I've seen a video, they asked Trump how he was going to implement his vaccine.
[02:11:50.126 --> 02:11:53.546]  He said he had the military up and ready to go.
[02:11:54.446 --> 02:11:57.727]  Yes, he said that the military would deploy it if you want it, yes.
[02:11:59.147 --> 02:12:00.428]  Oh, so, well I hope so.
[02:12:00.528 --> 02:12:01.728]  I'm a Trump supporter and everything.
[02:12:01.888 --> 02:12:04.048]  I just hope he doesn't disappoint us.
[02:12:04.768 --> 02:12:09.369]  Well let me tell you, if he says the military is coming to make me take something, we'll go to war brother.
[02:12:10.409 --> 02:12:12.930]  Yeah, me and my family will not take any vaccine.
[02:12:14.566 --> 02:12:15.467]  We're good to go.
[02:12:31.687 --> 02:12:33.448]  Let's see what's going on with that.
[02:12:33.488 --> 02:12:35.130]  Thank you for giving me an update on that.
[02:12:35.190 --> 02:12:36.411]  You know, we're not a big company.
[02:12:36.431 --> 02:12:42.115]  We've had a lot of bugs with the site because it serves millions of people a day, but it's getting better and your feedback is wonderful.
[02:12:42.155 --> 02:12:43.096]  We need your feedback.
[02:12:44.197 --> 02:12:51.242]  Just so I know, so I can tell the IT people, what type of phone do you have so that we can see if that's a bug to that phone or a general bug?
[02:12:52.243 --> 02:12:53.303]  Samsung Note 8.
[02:12:55.825 --> 02:12:56.406]  Note 8.
[02:12:58.007 --> 02:13:00.369]  And there's not even a download button for you or it doesn't work?
[02:13:00.965 --> 02:13:07.987]  Yeah, I see a bunch of complaints that stuff doesn't download, and then on my computer at home it downloads, and on my phone, those slow.
[02:13:08.067 --> 02:13:10.488]  So I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.
[02:13:10.568 --> 02:13:11.289]  God bless you.
[02:13:11.309 --> 02:13:12.549]  Anything else, Benny?
[02:13:31.262 --> 02:13:34.383]  Check that out, too, because it won't allow you.
[02:13:34.503 --> 02:13:35.704]  It just goes in and out.
[02:13:36.084 --> 02:13:40.726]  Oh, let me tell you, they Googled Bandai last year, and then they wouldn't let us update it.
[02:13:40.746 --> 02:13:42.526]  So our apps are all gone, yeah.
[02:13:43.287 --> 02:13:46.408]  We've got a web app you can find at Bandai Video, but great point, sir.
[02:13:46.448 --> 02:13:46.828]  I hear you.
[02:13:47.368 --> 02:13:47.868]  Anything else?
[02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.969]  He's gone.
[02:13:49.029 --> 02:13:50.109]  All right, Savannah, stay there.
[02:13:50.129 --> 02:13:51.270]  We're going to get into Antifa with you.
[02:13:51.650 --> 02:13:52.410]  Jamming a few more calls.
[02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:54.431]  We're going to have you come back for a couple hours tomorrow.
[02:13:55.538 --> 02:13:58.039]  Hannah Hernandez is very nice and she's kicking butt.
[02:13:58.059 --> 02:13:58.379]  Thank you.
[02:13:58.419 --> 02:13:59.459]  And she's a great patriot.
[02:13:59.799 --> 02:14:01.200]  And she didn't get radicalized by me.
[02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:02.040]  I didn't have to do anything.
[02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:04.041]  She just worked here and went out and saw the real world.
[02:14:04.061 --> 02:14:07.522]  And now, she's like, more radical than Alex Jones, folks.
[02:14:09.623 --> 02:14:13.224]  Couple of incredibly important action alerts for patriots out there.
[02:14:13.424 --> 02:14:15.424]  Stories that have broken on Infowars.com.
[02:14:15.865 --> 02:14:16.465]  Here's the latest.
[02:14:17.406 --> 02:14:24.890]  Doctors warned COVID pandemic actually practiced for biological warfare, and Bill Gates said this is just a drill for the real thing.
[02:14:25.251 --> 02:14:27.292]  I said that months before, but how did I know?
[02:14:28.252 --> 02:14:42.461]  It's in Operation Lockstep and in Event 201 that they needed a drill, and then they just launched a drill, and they're using regular deaths from other viruses in the column, but it's a real virus, so Gates can own it.
[02:14:43.342 --> 02:14:47.005]  And then release new COVIDs in the future, which he's told you he would do.
[02:14:47.105 --> 02:14:47.746]  Huge story.
[02:14:48.246 --> 02:14:56.153]  Globalist election inquiry, group war games, how Biden could seize power and Trump re-elected Soros, the Chinese government involved.
[02:14:56.473 --> 02:14:58.114]  We should not put up with it.
[02:14:58.675 --> 02:15:02.618]  We had a caller earlier talking about, you know, who should be wiped out in the power structure of the South American.
[02:15:03.499 --> 02:15:04.920]  Trump's starting to cut off the Chai comms.
[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:05.841]  He's starting to go after him.
[02:15:06.361 --> 02:15:09.664]  He's going to have Microsoft take over TikTok, which Gates doesn't run anymore.
[02:15:09.964 --> 02:15:11.065]  Savannah Hernandez, what do you think?
[02:15:12.031 --> 02:15:28.745]  I agree with you, Alex, and you know, just having to live through this election year has been quite interesting and seeing all of this stuff evolve, all of the things that you've been covering for so many years coming to fruition and people starting to wake up to it slowly, but surely they're waking up to it, which is a very good thing.
[02:15:28.865 --> 02:15:33.909]  So I'm glad that we're continuing to give these updates and wake people up to what's really going on.
[02:15:34.383 --> 02:15:38.206]  I wanted to get you in Sunday, but I know you've been working Saturday and Sunday a lot of hours, so I didn't.
[02:15:38.226 --> 02:15:44.832]  But I should probably have you and Owen in here for an hour or something tomorrow with all the clips you've got, just to analyze the craziness of Antifa.
[02:15:44.852 --> 02:15:47.435]  Because none of this has a time frame on it.
[02:15:47.455 --> 02:15:48.255]  It's all evergreen.
[02:15:48.275 --> 02:15:50.637]  Because more of this is going to happen in the next 91 days.
[02:15:50.677 --> 02:15:52.299]  But just, you've got a few clips here.
[02:15:52.599 --> 02:15:54.321]  Which ones do you want to play in just a nutshell?
[02:15:55.001 --> 02:16:10.178]  I saw finally state police in Austin stand up, even though the mayor said stand down, because when Antifa said we are going to have snipers on their own Facebook, they did have gun trucks, we are going to take over roads, the system finally figured out, hey, we have to stand up to this because citizens are going to pull their guns out and kill the Antifa.
[02:16:10.859 --> 02:16:14.964]  Exactly, and I do have one clip of a gentleman, a citizen here.
[02:16:15.004 --> 02:16:15.684]  He was a black man.
[02:16:15.704 --> 02:16:18.928]  He got out of his truck because they started to block the I-35.
[02:16:18.968 --> 02:16:27.397]  He got out of his vehicle and he said, basically, you guys need to get out of my way because I'm going to go to work or I'm going to air you out, which basically means he was going to run them over.
[02:16:27.818 --> 02:16:30.981]  So I think the police are realizing, too, the citizens are starting to be
[02:16:31.381 --> 02:16:33.123]  And that's why the globalists backed down.
[02:16:33.143 --> 02:16:34.304]  The police aren't bad on average.
[02:16:34.344 --> 02:16:39.207]  But the mayor and others had to back off because they realized, wait a minute, the citizens, black and white, are going to start killing people.
[02:16:39.227 --> 02:16:40.268]  We're going to come together.
[02:16:40.288 --> 02:16:43.671]  They don't want the image of us powerful raging and overturning them.
[02:16:43.831 --> 02:16:50.816]  And I think they're starting to realize, too, that it is the citizens who are going to get angry and start standing up in mass.
[02:16:50.957 --> 02:16:56.141]  And there are more citizens who are law-abiding citizens who don't want to see this type of chaos in our streets.
[02:16:56.841 --> 02:16:57.121]  I agree.
[02:17:24.056 --> 02:17:34.723]  And all it's going to take is one person, white, black, hispanic, getting out, kicking the ass with Humantifa, they're going to get piled and get their ass kicked, and then all the cars are going to disgorge and totally overrun Antifa.
[02:17:35.003 --> 02:17:35.463]  Exactly.
[02:17:35.503 --> 02:17:38.965]  That's point blank what's going to be happening, and they realize that.
[02:17:39.025 --> 02:17:45.990]  So the police did a really great job this week, and like I said, I can't emphasize that enough, because I think, you know, we all have been hard on officers around the nation.
[02:17:46.010 --> 02:17:47.711]  Yeah, it's not their fault they've been wanting to stand down.
[02:17:48.371 --> 02:17:49.952]  They were ordered to stand down, exactly.
[02:17:49.992 --> 02:17:52.833]  But here in Austin, the situation's quite different.
[02:17:52.853 --> 02:17:59.675]  And more than anything, you know, people say that it's very hard to continue to run an organization or anything that's based in hate.
[02:18:00.095 --> 02:18:02.456]  You can't keep running it because it's very tiring to do.
[02:18:02.496 --> 02:18:04.057]  And I was seeing that there as well.
[02:18:04.117 --> 02:18:07.838]  I mean, you have one or two radical people... You saw Antifa breaking down.
[02:18:07.858 --> 02:18:12.380]  Let's play the clip of the frontage roads, I-35 shut down, and a man is trying to get to work.
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:13.981]  Gets out and says, listen, get out of my way.
[02:18:14.021 --> 02:18:14.321]  Here it is.
[02:18:16.435 --> 02:18:18.358]  Look, I understand the cause.
[02:18:18.959 --> 02:18:22.483]  I appreciate it, but I gotta go to work.
[02:18:22.564 --> 02:18:23.004]  I'm black.
[02:18:23.365 --> 02:18:24.146]  I gotta go to work.
[02:18:24.186 --> 02:18:24.847]  I got bills.
[02:18:25.267 --> 02:18:25.888]  I got kids.
[02:18:25.908 --> 02:18:27.190]  Get the f*** out of my way.
[02:18:27.210 --> 02:18:28.912]  I'm about to air this bitch out, bro.
[02:18:28.932 --> 02:18:29.333]  Come on, bro.
[02:18:31.916 --> 02:18:33.977]  So Alex, this is my favorite part of this whole thing.
[02:18:33.997 --> 02:18:44.764]  So he gets back in his truck and I pan the camera back and you just see all the Antifa members standing there with their heads down as they let this truck pass through because they're not going to stand up to this man.
[02:18:44.784 --> 02:18:46.825]  They're not going to actually stand up and fight back.
[02:18:47.066 --> 02:18:47.426]  Look at them.
[02:18:47.446 --> 02:18:48.987]  They're all standing there so meekly.
[02:18:49.187 --> 02:18:49.827]  They're weak.
[02:18:50.088 --> 02:18:50.828]  They're pathetic.
[02:18:51.088 --> 02:18:53.530]  And I stood there and I was laughing in front of all of them all night.
[02:18:53.570 --> 02:18:55.191]  I didn't even need security out there.
[02:18:55.491 --> 02:18:58.173]  They're not an organized militia out in the streets like they think.
[02:18:58.213 --> 02:18:59.114]  They think they are.
[02:18:59.194 --> 02:19:00.695]  They really genuinely think they are.
[02:19:01.135 --> 02:19:04.258]  We had 40,000 people there of every race, color, and creed with guns.
[02:19:04.698 --> 02:19:05.379]  No problems.
[02:19:05.459 --> 02:19:06.059]  No violence.
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:07.601]  That totally freaked the left out.
[02:19:07.921 --> 02:19:08.301]  Exactly.
[02:19:08.321 --> 02:19:09.522]  Because we got our stuff squared away.
[02:19:09.563 --> 02:19:09.943]  They don't.
[02:19:10.503 --> 02:19:10.984]  Exactly.
[02:19:11.184 --> 02:19:17.450]  And again, that is what is finally getting across now, is that there's many Second Amendment
[02:19:18.510 --> 02:19:22.351]  Or gun-carrying citizens in America who are getting tired of this and are going to stand up.
[02:19:22.411 --> 02:19:23.812]  And again, we're not Russia.
[02:19:23.912 --> 02:19:26.053]  We're not places in Europe where they have their weapons taken.
[02:19:26.513 --> 02:19:27.293]  That's the difference.
[02:19:27.353 --> 02:19:28.453]  We have the Second Amendment.
[02:19:28.813 --> 02:19:31.194]  The left may have taken our First Amendment in most areas.
[02:19:31.394 --> 02:19:32.755]  We still got the Second Amendment.
[02:19:32.915 --> 02:19:33.855]  And they are checkmated.
[02:19:34.335 --> 02:19:34.795]  Exactly.
[02:19:34.976 --> 02:19:46.905]  And I think, too, that Garrett Foster getting shot and killed last weekend because he pointed his rifle at a gun-toting citizen, that woke up a lot of Antifa members here in Austin because a lot of them stood down.
[02:19:46.945 --> 02:19:49.046]  When the police told them to back up, they backed up.
[02:19:49.066 --> 02:19:51.628]  Well, that's right, because they said, what did he say minutes before getting killed?
[02:19:51.648 --> 02:19:52.489]  He goes, they're all wimps.
[02:19:52.809 --> 02:19:53.610]  I could push them around.
[02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:54.591]  None of them are going to stand up.
[02:19:55.313 --> 02:19:55.713]  Exactly.
[02:19:55.873 --> 02:19:57.314]  Like you think we're scared of you.
[02:19:57.554 --> 02:20:00.055]  We're scared of the trouble we're going to get when we kill your ass, dumbass.
[02:20:00.075 --> 02:20:00.875]  We're not scared of you.
[02:20:01.075 --> 02:20:08.118]  And that's why the right has showed so much restraint because they know that they're going to be the ones that face repercussion if they stand up for themselves.
[02:20:08.438 --> 02:20:11.479]  But Antifa here in this city of Austin, they're not setting up an autonomous zone.
[02:20:11.839 --> 02:20:19.202]  Yeah, when push comes to shove, these people, Soros and all of them, he may not have gotten arrested for World War II being a Nazi, but he's going to get arrested now.
[02:20:20.185 --> 02:20:21.086]  It's just so comical, Alex.
[02:20:21.106 --> 02:20:22.448]  You know what he was killing?
[02:20:22.628 --> 02:20:26.332]  Rounding up his fellow Jews in World War II and he's still around doing this?
[02:20:26.812 --> 02:20:27.874]  I mean, what the hell?
[02:20:28.434 --> 02:20:29.956]  Lex Luthor is a cartoon character.
[02:20:30.156 --> 02:20:31.578]  This is a real Lex Luthor.
[02:20:31.918 --> 02:20:36.884]  And Alex, you know, the great thing too is we have been talking about how George Soros funds BLM.
[02:20:37.104 --> 02:20:40.568]  That's all I see on my Instagram feed now, on my Twitter feed, on Facebook.
[02:20:40.808 --> 02:20:49.234]  So a lot of the younger generation, my age, even younger than me, even on TikTok, people were making videos about George Soros and his ties to BLM and how he's funding it.
[02:20:49.254 --> 02:20:51.355]  So people are really waking up to this, just like Bill Gates.
[02:20:51.655 --> 02:20:59.320]  You post anything about Bill Gates on Instagram, all the comments are, we're not taking your vaccines, you're evil, we don't like Bill Gates, we don't like George Soros.
[02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:02.222]  So people are really waking up to who is funding.
[02:21:02.302 --> 02:21:03.443]  I totally agree, Savannah.
[02:21:03.463 --> 02:21:04.524]  You are knocking it out of the park.
[02:21:04.564 --> 02:21:06.225]  Let's talk to Mohammed in Florida real quick.
[02:21:06.545 --> 02:21:07.245]  Mohammed, go ahead.
[02:21:07.265 --> 02:21:07.666]  You're on the air.
[02:21:08.444 --> 02:21:08.964]  Hey, Alex.
[02:21:09.585 --> 02:21:09.945]  Yeah, hey.
[02:21:09.985 --> 02:21:14.527]  You know, I'm pretty upset about Trump's complacency.
[02:21:15.768 --> 02:21:21.391]  I don't think he understands what's going to happen to him after he loses.
[02:21:21.731 --> 02:21:23.072]  These people are not going to stop.
[02:21:23.292 --> 02:21:24.573]  They are going to arrest him.
[02:21:25.093 --> 02:21:26.994]  They are going to arrest members of his family.
[02:21:27.434 --> 02:21:28.995]  They are going to intimidate his children.
[02:21:29.495 --> 02:21:31.716]  They are going to take this guy to the woodshed.
[02:21:31.736 --> 02:21:32.977]  And I don't think he understands that.
[02:21:32.997 --> 02:21:36.279]  I don't think he can grasp what is about to happen to him.
[02:21:36.857 --> 02:21:40.840]  There needs to be a sense of urgency from Trump, and we're not seeing that sense of urgency.
[02:21:40.941 --> 02:21:42.041]  I'm pretty upset about it.
[02:21:42.842 --> 02:21:43.563]  No, I agree.
[02:21:43.603 --> 02:21:45.905]  We're not really seeing a sense of urgency from Trump.
[02:21:46.225 --> 02:21:47.346]  That's been my biggest concern.
[02:21:47.366 --> 02:21:48.187]  What do you think, Savannah?
[02:21:49.308 --> 02:21:50.028]  I agree as well.
[02:21:50.048 --> 02:21:52.450]  It will be interesting to see what he does ahead of the election.
[02:21:52.811 --> 02:22:00.317]  The mail-in voter fraud is what I'm most interested in watching because we've seen the Democrats push for that, and Trump, I mean, he's trying to bring light to it, but what is he really doing?
[02:22:00.738 --> 02:22:02.499]  Is he going to actually put a stop to this?
[02:22:02.639 --> 02:22:03.860]  What's going to happen with the election?
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:04.321]  I don't know.
[02:22:05.444 --> 02:22:06.485]  Mohammed, what else do you think?
[02:22:06.505 --> 02:22:07.326]  What should Trump do?
[02:22:08.367 --> 02:22:11.070]  The biggest thing he needs to do is get hold of the media.
[02:22:11.250 --> 02:22:12.551]  The media is the biggest problem.
[02:22:12.591 --> 02:22:14.333]  China owns interest in all the media.
[02:22:14.873 --> 02:22:17.576]  When I was on YouTube the other day, I put in a comment.
[02:22:17.696 --> 02:22:18.417]  It was very simple.
[02:22:18.457 --> 02:22:21.120]  I put in a comment, China is evil.
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:22.541]  I refreshed the page.
[02:22:22.801 --> 02:22:25.344]  Thirty seconds later, that comment was removed.
[02:22:25.965 --> 02:22:26.845]  I did the same thing.
[02:22:26.885 --> 02:22:28.207]  I put in America is evil.
[02:22:29.052 --> 02:22:32.413]  30 seconds later, refresh the page, that comment was there.
[02:22:32.893 --> 02:22:34.453]  This is all sedition.
[02:22:34.473 --> 02:22:36.773]  He needs to declare a state of emergency.
[02:22:37.014 --> 02:22:38.514]  He needs to arrest the media heads.
[02:22:39.234 --> 02:22:41.534]  No, I agree, because I'm not for martial law and all this.
[02:22:41.754 --> 02:22:42.995]  We're already in it right now.
[02:22:43.015 --> 02:22:45.435]  And the government is not perfect, but it's a lot better.
[02:22:46.235 --> 02:22:54.137]  Did you know a month ago it came out that there's a bunch of stuff about China and Hong Kong you can't say, and I read about you can't say China is evil.
[02:22:54.197 --> 02:22:55.137]  You actually tried that?
[02:22:55.397 --> 02:22:56.017]  That happened to you?
[02:22:58.712 --> 02:22:59.313]  Thank you, Mohammed.
[02:22:59.393 --> 02:22:59.833]  God bless you.
[02:22:59.893 --> 02:23:01.495]  Alright, Henry and George, I'm out of time.
[02:23:01.515 --> 02:23:04.197]  I could be here all day, but Gerald Celente always does a great job.
[02:23:04.217 --> 02:23:08.762]  Savannah, you and Owen, because we're both down to this weekend, you should come back on for an hour tomorrow and tell us what happened.
[02:23:09.059 --> 02:23:09.859]  All right, sounds great Alex.
[02:23:09.879 --> 02:23:10.540]  We'll play more of the clips.
[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:11.000]  I'll be here.
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:14.821]  Henry and George, guys, seriously, get their name and number, but make me tomorrow.
[02:23:15.021 --> 02:23:16.001]  Call them.
[02:23:16.081 --> 02:23:18.282]  I always say we never call the callers back when we do this.
[02:23:18.622 --> 02:23:20.023]  I want to get them on first call tomorrow.
[02:23:20.043 --> 02:23:21.183]  We took a lot of calls today.
[02:23:21.523 --> 02:23:22.704]  Carol Celente's taking over.
[02:23:22.844 --> 02:23:25.865]  And then, they're going to have the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[02:23:25.885 --> 02:23:27.365]  I know Savannah loves that show.
[02:23:27.405 --> 02:23:28.186]  Are you going to be on there?
[02:23:28.386 --> 02:23:28.786]  I will be.
[02:23:28.826 --> 02:23:29.666]  I'll be on there at 5 p.m.
[02:23:29.706 --> 02:23:29.966]  today.
[02:23:29.986 --> 02:23:32.087]  Savannah loves the Owen Troyer show.
[02:23:32.447 --> 02:23:33.448]  She loves the War Room.
[02:23:33.788 --> 02:23:36.649]  So that's coming up today, 3 o'clock Central.
[02:23:36.669 --> 02:23:37.109]  Stay with us.
[02:23:38.629 --> 02:23:39.549]  Hello, hello.
[02:23:39.809 --> 02:23:41.930]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:41.950 --> 02:23:51.994]  I want to thank everybody who works on InfoWars for all they do to keep the truth alive as we do our best as well with the Trends Journal.
[02:23:52.975 --> 02:23:54.936]  And it's very important.
[02:23:54.996 --> 02:23:56.096]  People don't realize.
[02:23:56.116 --> 02:23:57.617]  I was thinking about it today.
[02:23:58.617 --> 02:24:01.478]  You have a nation that's addicted to junk food.
[02:24:02.859 --> 02:24:03.299]  Oh, yeah?
[02:24:03.419 --> 02:24:03.779]  Really?
[02:24:03.799 --> 02:24:03.839]  No.
[02:24:04.039 --> 02:24:06.901]  You know, take a look at those pictures.
[02:24:06.981 --> 02:24:07.381]  They had one
[02:24:08.595 --> 02:24:10.175]  Today, I forgot where I saw it.
[02:24:10.215 --> 02:24:13.156]  I think it was in... I forgot where it was.
[02:24:13.797 --> 02:24:15.457]  Maybe the Cartoon News Network.
[02:24:16.037 --> 02:24:22.899]  And they had people lined up in 1918 to get masks or something to that effect.
[02:24:22.919 --> 02:24:25.080]  It's in San Francisco.
[02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:28.261]  And you should see the way everybody's dressed.
[02:24:29.801 --> 02:24:31.562]  You know, this is a hundred years ago.
[02:24:31.622 --> 02:24:33.222]  A hundred years from today.
[02:24:33.242 --> 02:24:36.103]  And look how low we've sunk.
[02:24:37.452 --> 02:24:38.753]  Look what the people look like.
[02:24:39.874 --> 02:24:40.694]  Junk food.
[02:24:43.276 --> 02:24:44.097]  Junk dress.
[02:24:45.178 --> 02:24:46.219]  And junk news.
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:52.343]  So just like junk food destroys your body.
[02:24:53.384 --> 02:24:55.606]  Junk news destroys your mind.
[02:24:55.646 --> 02:24:56.086]  There it is.
[02:24:56.346 --> 02:24:56.767]  Look at that.
[02:24:56.827 --> 02:24:57.707]  Look at that photo.
[02:24:58.708 --> 02:25:00.850]  Look at what the people look like.
[02:25:02.171 --> 02:25:03.352]  These are laborers.
[02:25:06.004 --> 02:25:09.466]  And they had their own little stores back then before the bigs took over.
[02:25:12.368 --> 02:25:16.030]  I have a photo of my parents' wedding, May Their Souls Rest In Peace, 1934.
[02:25:16.090 --> 02:25:21.134]  They were laborers, worked in fish stores, manufacturing.
[02:25:22.795 --> 02:25:24.996]  Everybody elegant as can be.
[02:25:25.016 --> 02:25:26.377]  You look at that wedding picture.
[02:25:26.857 --> 02:25:27.397]  Guess what?
[02:25:28.578 --> 02:25:30.079]  Nobody could top it today.
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:32.581]  The style, the dress, the look.
[02:25:33.281 --> 02:25:34.542]  That's how low we've fallen.
[02:25:35.486 --> 02:25:37.187]  And then you go back to the junk news.
[02:25:38.068 --> 02:25:55.664]  Just like junk food destroys your body, and dressing like junk destroys your self-respect, junk news is a mental illness.
[02:25:55.684 --> 02:25:57.826]  It causes mental illness.
[02:25:57.886 --> 02:26:02.610]  It makes you really stupid, and you just buy the crap that they feed you.
[02:26:03.536 --> 02:26:10.058]  And being that most people, again by the numbers, only 70% of Americans are overweight.
[02:26:12.238 --> 02:26:13.999]  Only 42% are obese.
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:20.961]  So, keep eating the crap that they feed you.
[02:26:21.641 --> 02:26:23.682]  Destroys your body and destroys your mind.
[02:26:23.702 --> 02:26:29.883]  You know, there's that photo of Woodstock back in 1969, when I was a youth.
[02:26:33.052 --> 02:26:34.512]  Not that young, but pretty young.
[02:26:36.653 --> 02:26:40.834]  And you look at the people.
[02:26:42.395 --> 02:26:43.515]  Then you look at them now.
[02:26:44.456 --> 02:26:48.157]  I look at these people waiting on food lines, the shots that they show.
[02:26:49.717 --> 02:26:50.617]  It's blimp land.
[02:26:53.758 --> 02:26:57.920]  So going back to the news and why it's so important.
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:02.121]  The people are addicted
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:03.981]  To junk news.
[02:27:04.702 --> 02:27:07.023]  They're only buying the sound bites of it.
[02:27:07.704 --> 02:27:08.905]  They don't know the facts.
[02:27:09.925 --> 02:27:12.928]  And the media keeps selling fear and hysteria.
[02:27:14.569 --> 02:27:18.231]  Utrends Journal is going out tomorrow and working on this now.
[02:27:20.053 --> 02:27:24.736]  And the headline is media sells fear with horror headlines.
[02:27:24.816 --> 02:27:25.977]  Majority buys it.
[02:27:26.737 --> 02:27:28.859]  Here are some of the headlines from last week.
[02:27:30.017 --> 02:27:33.659]  Tokyo could declare emergency if situation worsens.
[02:27:34.999 --> 02:27:35.460]  Reuters.
[02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:37.381]  31 July.
[02:27:38.561 --> 02:27:40.042]  So I look at Japan, right?
[02:27:41.202 --> 02:27:42.723]  This is a country of 126.5 million people.
[02:27:42.743 --> 02:27:43.223]  126 million people.
[02:27:43.243 --> 02:27:43.543]  Got it?
[02:27:43.603 --> 02:27:44.044]  How many died?
[02:27:44.124 --> 02:27:44.484]  March.
[02:27:44.504 --> 02:27:44.644]  April.
[02:27:59.904 --> 02:28:02.045]  May, June, July.
[02:28:02.285 --> 02:28:03.305]  Five months!
[02:28:05.586 --> 02:28:11.588]  Hey, moron, idiot, low-life, slimer, little liberal cowards, could you count five months?
[02:28:12.908 --> 02:28:15.789]  Prostitutes that are doing this, could you count five months?
[02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:23.152]  They have the grand total of 1,004 people dead when I wrote this yesterday.
[02:28:23.172 --> 02:28:24.572]  1,004 people
[02:28:29.079 --> 02:28:33.542]  Out of 126.5 million?
[02:28:33.582 --> 02:28:35.223]  What are you telling me this crap for?
[02:28:37.405 --> 02:28:38.526]  In five months?
[02:28:42.168 --> 02:28:43.069]  200 people a month?
[02:28:45.431 --> 02:28:47.852]  200 people a month out of 226 million people.
[02:28:48.232 --> 02:28:49.653]  How many died of overdoses?
[02:28:49.693 --> 02:28:52.055]  How many died of whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever?
[02:28:56.418 --> 02:28:57.399]  And that, by the way,
[02:28:58.985 --> 02:29:03.447]  You know what percentage of that of the population is?
[02:29:03.467 --> 02:29:03.447]  0.00796%.
[02:29:04.968 --> 02:29:14.013]  Vietnam records first COVID-19 death.
[02:29:15.214 --> 02:29:16.755]  BBC News.
[02:29:17.855 --> 02:29:19.716]  It should be BS News.
[02:29:21.978 --> 02:29:24.119]  This is what they're doing to the people.
[02:29:24.839 --> 02:29:27.721]  And the morons and idiots swallow the crap.
[02:29:34.454 --> 02:29:34.674]  Right?
[02:29:35.355 --> 02:29:35.775]  There it is.
[02:29:36.956 --> 02:29:37.837]  So here's the number.
[02:29:38.978 --> 02:29:42.141]  Vietnam has 97.3 million people.
[02:29:45.143 --> 02:29:47.365]  Right now it has a total of six deaths.
[02:29:49.888 --> 02:29:51.909]  Or 0.00006% of the population.
[02:29:51.929 --> 02:29:53.271]  More prostitute crap.
[02:30:02.173 --> 02:30:06.996]  And again, this is why you go to InfoWars and subscribe to the Trends Journal, because we don't do that.
[02:30:07.876 --> 02:30:14.860]  China reports 127 new coronavirus cases, highest since March 5th.
[02:30:16.001 --> 02:30:22.344]  Now remember, the coronavirus wasn't such a happy Lunar New Year in China, struck in the middle of January.
[02:30:27.662 --> 02:30:47.578]  China has 4,634 deaths, and let's say they're lying, we'll make it more than that, but even at this number, of 1.4 billion people, or 0.0003310 of the population.
[02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:51.321]  They're doing this every day.
[02:30:52.762 --> 02:30:54.604]  They're selling fear and hysteria.
[02:30:54.624 --> 02:30:55.785]  So here's what I ask people.
[02:30:57.415 --> 02:31:06.580]  Do you know someone that died of COVID-19 or was hospitalized?
[02:31:10.402 --> 02:31:11.123]  I'm just asking.
[02:31:12.583 --> 02:31:14.705]  Everybody I ask, this is what they tell me.
[02:31:15.005 --> 02:31:22.909]  Well, no, I don't know anybody, but a friend of mine has a friend who knows a friend who has a friend or something along that line.
[02:31:24.730 --> 02:31:26.311]  This is fear and hysteria.
[02:31:27.967 --> 02:31:30.889]  I'm getting blackballed now from more shows.
[02:31:30.989 --> 02:31:32.149]  I don't want to mention who.
[02:31:32.170 --> 02:31:35.792]  It has to do with money.
[02:31:38.473 --> 02:31:40.074]  And precious metal.
[02:31:43.356 --> 02:31:45.477]  And I was one of their biggest hits when I'm on.
[02:31:46.138 --> 02:31:49.640]  But because I disagree with them, I'm not on anymore.
[02:31:50.841 --> 02:31:54.002]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:31:54.683 --> 02:31:56.604]  And of course, subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[02:31:57.210 --> 02:32:01.371]  Because if we don't keep the truth alive, we're going to die in hell on earth.
[02:32:01.391 --> 02:32:02.992]  We're going to be right back.
[02:32:04.172 --> 02:32:04.953]  Hello, hello!
[02:32:05.253 --> 02:32:07.393]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:32:08.554 --> 02:32:10.855]  You know, it's not only America that's doing this.
[02:32:10.975 --> 02:32:12.575]  A lot of the Western media is.
[02:32:13.836 --> 02:32:18.737]  And one of the ones to look at is Australia.
[02:32:20.338 --> 02:32:26.260]  Victoria increases coronavirus lockdowns, declares state of disaster.
[02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:41.261]  Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has bowed to the realities of his state's spiraling coronavirus infections and introduced the nation's toughest lockdown restrictions.
[02:32:42.562 --> 02:32:45.645]  More important announcements are on their way for Victoria today.
[02:32:46.505 --> 02:32:54.692]  Also, Mr. Andrews saying incoming rules for specific industries will force some businesses to close and others to
[02:32:55.313 --> 02:32:57.074]  Slow down operations.
[02:32:57.754 --> 02:33:02.116]  The state recorded 671 new cases on Sunday.
[02:33:02.136 --> 02:33:03.457]  You ready?
[02:33:05.478 --> 02:33:09.580]  And seven more elderly Victorians have died.
[02:33:10.881 --> 02:33:15.723]  Six of the fatalities were connected to virus outbreaks in age care homes.
[02:33:18.625 --> 02:33:20.786]  It's the same thing in the United States.
[02:33:24.227 --> 02:33:33.769]  Some 50% of the people that have died or elderly with pre-existing chronic conditions from nursing homes.
[02:33:34.929 --> 02:33:37.690]  Oh no, when you get to nursing home, when you get out, you go to day camp.
[02:33:38.270 --> 02:33:39.530]  You're just there for a little while.
[02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:42.391]  You're gonna die, you got it?
[02:33:43.591 --> 02:33:44.991]  And this makes you go quicker.
[02:33:45.511 --> 02:33:48.872]  You close down countries and states for this?
[02:33:54.087 --> 02:33:54.547]  You ready?
[02:33:56.768 --> 02:34:05.331]  6.4 million people live in Victoria.
[02:34:05.351 --> 02:34:06.411]  That's where Melbourne is.
[02:34:10.693 --> 02:34:12.113]  The country has 25.5 million people.
[02:34:22.366 --> 02:34:26.208]  Just before I went on the air, I looked at how many dead in Australia.
[02:34:26.228 --> 02:34:26.208]  221.
[02:34:26.248 --> 02:34:29.970]  221 people, March, April, May, June, July.
[02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:37.473]  Five months, 221 people died, and you're telling me that you're closing down the entire economy and ruining the lives of
[02:34:51.857 --> 02:34:53.666]  Scores of millions?
[02:34:55.535 --> 02:34:55.977]  For what?
[02:34:57.617 --> 02:35:14.061]  Because I'm the Prime Minister, or whatever I am, Victorian Premier, a Premier jerk, a Premier first-class piece of garbage crap, and like they do most everywhere, look at this little boy of nothing!
[02:35:14.281 --> 02:35:16.702]  And I love how they have these people all over doing this.
[02:35:17.022 --> 02:35:17.782]  Like, what?
[02:35:17.962 --> 02:35:22.723]  This is government money, they do it all the time, and they put in the phony people doing it too.
[02:35:23.103 --> 02:35:25.904]  So if you can't hear it, you can see it.
[02:35:26.304 --> 02:35:29.186]  And you don't need this to know what that is.
[02:35:29.486 --> 02:35:31.507]  You don't have to speak one word.
[02:35:31.928 --> 02:35:37.551]  All you have to do is look at these little pieces of crap and you can see what crap comes out of their mouth.
[02:35:37.891 --> 02:35:40.793]  You don't need a sign language person to tell you.
[02:35:42.915 --> 02:35:44.456]  And all the people bow to it.
[02:35:44.536 --> 02:35:46.557]  No, it's not they're going after Trump.
[02:35:46.997 --> 02:35:48.398]  Yeah, maybe they are.
[02:35:48.418 --> 02:35:51.060]  They're doing this everywhere.
[02:35:53.869 --> 02:35:59.252]  And the people bow down and take it right from their premiere.
[02:35:59.832 --> 02:36:08.756]  Little Danny Andrews, a little boy of nothing like the little slimers you got in a city, state and country near you.
[02:36:11.077 --> 02:36:12.738]  Abbott and Costello.
[02:36:13.956 --> 02:36:26.006]  Baby Andy Cuomo, Mario's little boy, a little boy of nothing, if daddy didn't get him there, like gruesome Newsome tied to the Klan.
[02:36:28.107 --> 02:36:29.268]  You mean the Ku Klux Klan?
[02:36:29.308 --> 02:36:31.490]  No, the F you know what Klan.
[02:36:34.412 --> 02:36:35.313]  One after another.
[02:36:36.854 --> 02:36:37.935]  Facts don't matter.
[02:36:42.435 --> 02:36:44.296]  People that are dying are elderly.
[02:36:47.879 --> 02:36:49.020]  One after another.
[02:36:49.821 --> 02:36:54.724]  But they had some protests over there in Germany over the weekend.
[02:36:58.167 --> 02:37:03.451]  The American media reports, or the Western media, that about 20,000 showed up.
[02:37:04.532 --> 02:37:12.318]  Other reports that I'm reading are more like 100,000 took to the streets throughout Germany.
[02:37:13.041 --> 02:37:13.761]  On Saturday.
[02:37:16.322 --> 02:37:19.763]  Protesting the mass square.
[02:37:19.823 --> 02:37:20.583]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:37:20.863 --> 02:37:22.244]  Is that 20,000 people?
[02:37:25.485 --> 02:37:30.706]  Oh, but if it was a cause that they liked, then it would have been different.
[02:37:32.527 --> 02:37:34.367]  Then they would have inflated the numbers.
[02:37:37.808 --> 02:37:39.889]  And you know what the toilet paper record
[02:37:41.124 --> 02:37:43.206]  Referred to it as the people that were there?
[02:37:43.226 --> 02:37:53.375]  Now they threw in a word Nazis, quoting people, right-wingers, and populists.
[02:37:57.018 --> 02:38:01.782]  I'm totally against wearing masks only because I know the data and the facts.
[02:38:04.284 --> 02:38:08.688]  I know that the World Health Organization, I know that the Centers for Disease Control,
[02:38:10.535 --> 02:38:11.215]  And prevention.
[02:38:11.896 --> 02:38:20.761]  I know that jawbong Fauci, the little fraud, fraud Fauci, flip-flop Fauci, little disgusting person.
[02:38:21.201 --> 02:38:22.241]  Oh, but he's Italian.
[02:38:22.281 --> 02:38:23.182]  Yeah, I could care less.
[02:38:23.802 --> 02:38:24.623]  And that's the other thing.
[02:38:24.903 --> 02:38:33.187]  I don't care if you're black, white, green, yellow, Jewish, Protestant, I could... Whatever religion, whatever you believe in, I could care less.
[02:38:33.848 --> 02:38:35.229]  Good and bad comes in all of them.
[02:38:36.549 --> 02:38:37.630]  That little clown boy,
[02:38:39.827 --> 02:38:46.710]  He said back on 60 Minutes, back in March, that masks were ineffective.
[02:38:47.170 --> 02:38:51.912]  And then he puts it down under his chin, and that makes it even more dangerous.
[02:38:52.452 --> 02:39:01.156]  Because if you did get anything, then you put it back on your face, and now it's in your nose, and up your you-know-what.
[02:39:01.496 --> 02:39:02.756]  Because that'd be nice to him.
[02:39:05.337 --> 02:39:06.518]  The facts don't matter.
[02:39:08.007 --> 02:39:21.312]  The Germans were fighting, and the American media and the Western media played it down like they were Nazis, right-wingers, and populists.
[02:39:22.472 --> 02:39:33.536]  How stupid, how ignorant, how ignorant to classify all those people in three minor categories.
[02:39:33.917 --> 02:39:34.717]  I'm none of those.
[02:39:38.297 --> 02:39:45.720]  How about I do the research and know the data and don't swallow the crap that junk food people eat.
[02:39:47.721 --> 02:39:56.185]  They swallow the crap from the junk food vendors and swallow the crap from the Cuomo's on CNN.
[02:39:56.885 --> 02:40:01.647]  The little lemons, you want a piece of Donnie Lemon?
[02:40:04.128 --> 02:40:06.629]  How about little Andy C. Cooper?
[02:40:06.649 --> 02:40:07.510]  A little
[02:40:08.169 --> 02:40:09.649]  Mommy's boy!
[02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:13.471]  That's right, Gloria Vanderbilt's baby!
[02:40:15.031 --> 02:40:16.071]  I look at the facts.
[02:40:17.012 --> 02:40:22.013]  But what they do is they take hundreds of thousands of people and categorize them.
[02:40:22.993 --> 02:40:28.495]  But the important thing also is, you don't see these kind of protests in America.
[02:40:31.876 --> 02:40:33.996]  People have lost their courage in this country.
[02:40:35.237 --> 02:40:36.237]  They lost their fight.
[02:40:37.765 --> 02:40:38.866]  Again, look what they look like.
[02:40:43.330 --> 02:40:44.010]  Look what they eat.
[02:40:45.632 --> 02:40:46.672]  Look what they listen to.
[02:40:48.574 --> 02:40:49.635]  Look who they vote for.
[02:40:52.978 --> 02:40:54.319]  Look what the schools have become.
[02:40:55.119 --> 02:40:55.440]  Fight?
[02:40:56.220 --> 02:40:57.581]  How dare you, Salenti!
[02:40:59.403 --> 02:41:02.165]  We have no bullying zones in our schools!
[02:41:03.747 --> 02:41:05.288]  Snowflake America!
[02:41:07.346 --> 02:41:10.027]  From the stars and stripes to snowflakes.
[02:41:11.867 --> 02:41:13.148]  The country of cowards.
[02:41:14.688 --> 02:41:17.289]  Except those listening to InfoWars.
[02:41:17.329 --> 02:41:20.350]  We'll be back in a little bit.
[02:41:21.290 --> 02:41:21.910]  Stay tuned.
[02:41:23.710 --> 02:41:26.851]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:27.451 --> 02:41:28.272]  So here's the deal.
[02:41:28.852 --> 02:41:36.634]  You know, one of the stories we're writing about in the Trends Journal, it'll be out tomorrow, it's a weekly, every Tuesday it goes out, are reopening schools.

[02:41:59.812 --> 02:42:02.894]  Listen, the globalists, as we know, are trying to keep our children
[02:42:03.644 --> 02:42:07.266]  Dumb, uneducated, and make them easy to control.
[02:42:07.327 --> 02:42:08.727]  And they're doing a great job of it.
[02:42:09.308 --> 02:42:15.612]  So, InfoWars is giving you new ways to support the show and help spread the word.
[02:42:15.632 --> 02:42:16.613]  And that's what you have to do.

[02:42:56.709 --> 02:42:57.489]  All 50% off and

[02:43:04.819 --> 02:43:07.180]  BioTruth Selenium, 50% off.
[02:43:08.381 --> 02:43:10.782]  ExtendoWise, 50% off.
[02:43:11.422 --> 02:43:14.324]  Alexa Pure Breeze available for just $149.
[02:43:14.404 --> 02:43:20.748]  Storable Food is back in stock and it's on short order.
[02:43:21.248 --> 02:43:27.852]  And man, that's something you really need to consider getting because things are going to get ugly and you're going to want to have all the
[02:43:30.493 --> 02:43:31.074]  An a.m.
[02:43:31.154 --> 02:43:31.634]  p.m.
[02:43:31.694 --> 02:43:35.577]  day and night pack and pack power stack fifty percent off.
[02:43:36.058 --> 02:43:44.105]  So listen, fight back to reopen America and save big at the Info Wars specials today.
[02:43:44.125 --> 02:43:52.051]  And of course, you need to keep the truth alive because they're killing us without it.
[02:43:53.873 --> 02:43:56.455]  And I was talking about what's going on in Germany.
[02:43:57.296 --> 02:43:57.956]  You know, they had a
[02:43:59.295 --> 02:44:01.697]  Came out with their GDP numbers last week.
[02:44:01.777 --> 02:44:02.938]  Gross domestic product.
[02:44:03.438 --> 02:44:04.739]  That was only the worst since 1970.
[02:44:04.899 --> 02:44:07.802]  And this is Japan.
[02:44:09.063 --> 02:44:10.684]  And the people taking to the streets.
[02:44:12.385 --> 02:44:14.927]  Again, here's some numbers for you.
[02:44:17.029 --> 02:44:20.051]  There's a grand total of 9,206 deaths in Germany of a population of 84 million.
[02:44:21.812 --> 02:44:22.113]  Or zero
[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:43.704]  I said that the New York Times, the toilet paper record, they call themselves the paper record.
[02:44:44.024 --> 02:44:52.169]  The only record that they have to prove is a murderous track record of selling us wars based on lies.
[02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:55.352]  Hey, you remember them aluminum tubes they were selling?
[02:44:56.781 --> 02:45:01.384]  Saddam Hussein-ism is filling them up with uranium and on and on and on.
[02:45:03.205 --> 02:45:05.587]  Yeah, how about Russiagate?
[02:45:05.647 --> 02:45:07.308]  And on and on and on and on.
[02:45:07.788 --> 02:45:26.461]  Yeah, that New York Times, I said they were calling the Germans that were protesting populists and right-wing populists, they were calling them conspiracy theorists and right-wing populists.
[02:45:30.779 --> 02:45:32.379]  That's how disgusting it all is.
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:38.581]  If you don't believe what they sell you, look at these conspiracy theorists.
[02:45:42.883 --> 02:45:45.023]  How ridiculous.
[02:45:45.043 --> 02:45:47.284]  100,000 people.
[02:45:49.525 --> 02:45:52.085]  And look at it, the tough cops lock up the little people.
[02:45:53.086 --> 02:45:57.027]  While the banksters and the criminals that steal our money every day
[02:45:57.674 --> 02:46:04.999]  And the defense industry that steals our money as we work for it and use it for the military to kill innocent people.
[02:46:05.060 --> 02:46:05.880]  That's okay.
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:07.942]  These little tough guys don't arrest them.
[02:46:08.142 --> 02:46:08.942]  No, only us.
[02:46:10.564 --> 02:46:16.108]  So going back to, well, here was some of the things, by the way, the protests that they were saying.
[02:46:18.029 --> 02:46:26.876]  Among the signs carried, stop the new normal, freedom over fear, the masks are muzzles and
[02:46:27.486 --> 02:46:28.967]  The mask is stupid.
[02:46:32.349 --> 02:46:33.730]  We are the second wave.
[02:46:34.571 --> 02:46:38.093]  We're here and we're loud because we're being robbed of our freedom.
[02:46:41.775 --> 02:46:43.116]  You don't see that in America.
[02:46:43.136 --> 02:46:49.400]  So I mentioned what's going on in Germany because of the economy as well.
[02:46:51.441 --> 02:46:56.865]  And as you well know, my years on Alex Jones and the subscribers to the Trends Journal,
[02:46:58.436 --> 02:47:02.597]  No one has forecast gold more accurately than I have.
[02:47:04.818 --> 02:47:06.698]  Go back, it's there in print.
[02:47:08.118 --> 02:47:13.980]  The gold bull run has begun and it began in the early 2000s.
[02:47:15.300 --> 02:47:16.401]  The dot-com bust.
[02:47:19.601 --> 02:47:26.143]  And then I said what would happen with gold prices following the panic of 08, just before it.
[02:47:28.072 --> 02:47:32.893]  And then on June 6th of last year, I forecast the gold bull run.
[02:47:35.494 --> 02:47:36.274]  Gold was $1,332 an ounce.
[02:47:36.334 --> 02:47:37.275]  Today, it's in the high 1900s.
[02:47:37.315 --> 02:47:39.075]  Silver has gone up 37% since I forecast its rise in June.
[02:47:40.556 --> 02:47:41.076]  Where is it heading?
[02:47:59.053 --> 02:48:11.320]  When I talk about storable foods and what you need, and I don't give financial advice, we're into an economic calamity unimaginable.
[02:48:13.542 --> 02:48:16.283]  New York City is a ghost town.
[02:48:18.064 --> 02:48:19.805]  One town after another.
[02:48:20.826 --> 02:48:22.447]  Ghost towns USA.
[02:48:23.948 --> 02:48:24.848]  And around the world.
[02:48:26.169 --> 02:48:26.749]  Tourism.
[02:48:29.172 --> 02:48:30.132]  D.E.D.
[02:48:34.093 --> 02:48:41.455]  Around the world, 26% of tourism in Europe comes from Americans.
[02:48:42.535 --> 02:48:44.096]  And we're not allowed to go there.
[02:48:46.316 --> 02:48:58.259]  Countries like Spain and Italy, somewhere near 15% of their GDP, gross domestic product, depends on tourism.
[02:49:01.499 --> 02:49:03.120]  Look how empty the streets are.
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:04.620]  This is real.
[02:49:06.301 --> 02:49:10.643]  I remember there was a song when I was back in the days when it was fun.
[02:49:11.743 --> 02:49:14.844]  The neon lights on Broadway.
[02:49:16.145 --> 02:49:16.785]  Gone.
[02:49:18.066 --> 02:49:19.006]  Broadway.
[02:49:19.026 --> 02:49:20.967]  Forget about it.
[02:49:21.127 --> 02:49:21.507]  Dead.
[02:49:25.009 --> 02:49:25.589]  And now.
[02:49:26.474 --> 02:49:32.716]  The same little geek freaks who started the fear and terror, they're the first ones that shut down in America.
[02:49:33.736 --> 02:49:40.017]  Last week Google announced that they're not going to have their employees coming back until next July.
[02:49:42.078 --> 02:49:44.418]  What does that do to commercial real estate sector?
[02:49:46.639 --> 02:49:47.339]  It kills it.
[02:49:48.259 --> 02:49:50.460]  And all the businesses that rely on it.
[02:49:54.773 --> 02:49:56.573]  They were the first ones to do this.
[02:49:58.394 --> 02:50:00.074]  And the rest of the country followed.
[02:50:00.654 --> 02:50:02.575]  Gruesome Newsome in California.
[02:50:02.615 --> 02:50:05.315]  You look at the numbers of how many people died in Silicon Valley.
[02:50:05.756 --> 02:50:06.316]  It's minimal.
[02:50:08.056 --> 02:50:11.237]  So what I'm saying to you is you better prepare for the greatest depression.
[02:50:11.937 --> 02:50:14.218]  The motto of the Trends Journal is think for yourself.
[02:50:14.258 --> 02:50:15.158]  Do what you want to do.
[02:50:15.438 --> 02:50:16.578]  We just put the facts down.
[02:50:17.738 --> 02:50:22.700]  Infowars is selling you products that you could use to survive.
[02:50:25.031 --> 02:50:28.093]  We try to give you information in the Trends Journal to help you thrive.
[02:50:31.035 --> 02:50:32.396]  Plan ahead for the worst.
[02:50:33.797 --> 02:50:35.958]  If the worst doesn't happen, you've lost nothing.
[02:50:37.239 --> 02:50:41.702]  If the worst happens and you didn't do anything, you can lose everything.
[02:50:43.063 --> 02:50:44.704]  This thing is going down hard.
[02:50:44.764 --> 02:50:46.045]  It's going down fast.
[02:50:46.545 --> 02:50:48.627]  This is unprecedented in world history.
[02:50:49.608 --> 02:50:51.529]  Never have nations shut down like this.
[02:50:52.415 --> 02:50:55.777]  And remember all these little clowns used to talk about a V-shape recovery?
[02:50:56.117 --> 02:50:57.898]  Well, maybe it'll be a U-shape recovery.
[02:50:57.918 --> 02:51:01.320]  Yeah, F-U-V-N-A-Y-X-Y-Z recovery.
[02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:02.101]  Forget about it.
[02:51:03.982 --> 02:51:05.062]  Prepare for the worst.
[02:51:06.983 --> 02:51:08.644]  The numbers are in gold.
[02:51:09.585 --> 02:51:11.306]  The numbers are in silver.
[02:51:12.266 --> 02:51:14.548]  The numbers are in the bankruptcies.
[02:51:15.628 --> 02:51:18.990]  The numbers are in the people that aren't flying anymore.
[02:51:20.171 --> 02:51:21.592]  The numbers are in the facts.
[02:51:22.827 --> 02:51:24.148]  Don't eat junk food.
[02:51:25.789 --> 02:51:27.509]  Don't devour junk news.
[02:51:29.010 --> 02:51:29.951]  Stay strong.
[02:51:30.071 --> 02:51:30.771]  Stay healthy.
[02:51:30.791 --> 02:51:35.594]  Get in the best physical shape you can and emotionally and spiritually.
[02:51:36.414 --> 02:51:37.515]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:51:38.215 --> 02:51:39.936]  See you next week on InfoWars.
[02:51:51.363 --> 02:51:56.309]  The first time I used activated charcoal toothpaste was back in 2018.
[02:51:56.349 --> 02:52:00.755]  And I was like, whoa, my mouth is so fresh, so clean.
[02:52:00.795 --> 02:52:02.537]  My teeth are so white.
[02:52:02.597 --> 02:52:03.939]  I've never felt something like this.
[02:52:03.979 --> 02:52:04.540]  What's going on?
[02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:06.322]  It was a major leading brand.
[02:52:06.642 --> 02:52:08.785]  So I brought it to my dad, who's a retired dentist.
[02:52:09.085 --> 02:52:13.367]  He brought it to a big company we use that's produced some other high quality toothpaste that we've sold.
[02:52:13.728 --> 02:52:25.273]  And I said, I want basically to clone this major brand, but I want to take the fillers and things out that experts had told us other dentists and oral surgeons could strip off enamel from the teeth.
[02:52:25.734 --> 02:52:33.918]  So we have produced activated charcoal toothpaste that is enamel safe and doesn't damage your teeth while still cleaning
[02:52:34.218 --> 02:52:34.758]  We're good to go!
[02:52:57.631 --> 02:53:10.940]  You will see nine other products that he developed with other top supplement developers, not just the toothpaste, and you'll also find the activated charcoal mouthwash that he's produced, and people that have already gotten it are giving it five-star reviews.
[02:53:11.321 --> 02:53:21.868]  We also sell the whole line at InfoWareStore.com, but wherever you get it, it will fund the InfoWare and support us up against globalist attacks to be able to fight these tyrants into the future.
[02:53:22.168 --> 02:53:25.991]  I have been shaped by many things in my lifetime, but the strongest influence has been my father.
[02:53:26.411 --> 02:53:31.393]  He always taught me to be a straight shooter and give people the highest quality in business and you'll be successful.
[02:53:31.693 --> 02:53:32.274]  We've done that.
[02:53:32.354 --> 02:53:33.294]  We've been successful.
[02:53:33.334 --> 02:53:39.697]  That's why we have Dr. Jones Naturals at InfoWarsTore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com as well.
[02:53:39.997 --> 02:53:40.998]  It's all high quality.
[02:53:41.018 --> 02:53:41.898]  It doesn't have fillers.
[02:53:42.178 --> 02:53:43.199]  It doesn't have additives.
[02:53:43.499 --> 02:53:49.201]  It just has ingredients that are known to work and absolutely deliver to you so you're happy and you order again.

[02:53:53.903 --> 02:53:58.966]  As men age, they may often experience a loss in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:54:01.827 --> 02:54:04.589]  That's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[02:55:08.817 --> 02:55:12.138]  And they found her with a phone she was trying to get rid of wrapped in tinfoil.
[02:55:12.198 --> 02:55:13.439]  Now, why would she do that?
[02:55:13.459 --> 02:55:16.660]  Because the big genius spy did not have one of these.

[02:55:51.368 --> 02:55:53.689]  You protect yourself and your data from the
[02:55:53.849 --> 02:55:57.253]  Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clinton Foundation contact tracers.
[02:55:57.293 --> 02:56:06.502]  You protect yourself from all of these people and it is so critical that all of us habituate ourselves and get in the habit now of putting our cell phones, we're not using them, in one of these.
