[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:04.771]  I'm Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com at Camp Mabry in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:08.292]  This is the Texas State National Guard base.
[00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:11.253]  This is the main spot where everybody mobilizes from.
[00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:14.194]  They coordinate all the National Guards throughout the state.
[00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:21.296]  Yesterday, the Governor, Governor Rick Perry, said that he will be mobilizing a thousand troops to go to our borders.
[00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:26.378]  So I came out here to ask the Public Affairs Officer what their mission is going to be, when they're going,
[00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:27.419]  We're good.
[00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:44.425]  A thousand soldiers will be deploying, but it'll be within the next 30 days.
[00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:52.051]  They have to do their PMCSs, which is check their vehicles, and they need to make sure that everything's fully mission-capable for the mission.
[00:00:52.572 --> 00:01:00.738]  And what the lady told me there, she said that DPS is the one calling the shots for this mobilization of National Guard forces to our border.
[00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:04.561]  So what we're going to try to do is coordinate, get another meeting up here with them,
[00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:10.792]  We'll keep you more informed on this issue with our Border Patrol and the National Guard being sent down there.
[00:01:11.192 --> 00:01:12.014]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:01:12.074 --> 00:01:12.895]  Back to you, Leanne.
