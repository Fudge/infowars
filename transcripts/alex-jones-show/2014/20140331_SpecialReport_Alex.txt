[00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:04.717]  The Second Amendment shall not be infringed.
[00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.958]  You people need to understand that.
[00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:07.999]  Go f**k yourself.
[00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.340]  Good comment, sir.
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.720]  Thank you.
[00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:12.502]  Go f**k yourself.
[00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:13.543]  Good comment, sir.
[00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:16.207]  Go f*** yourself!
[00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:19.169]  Is that the way we want our elected officials to act?
[00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.893]  Then come out with a weak, I'm sorry that you didn't appreciate my intentionally offensive words apology.
[00:00:25.534 --> 00:00:26.955]  But they're not the only ones.
[00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:33.580]  Right here in the city of Austin, activists took to City Hall to voice concerns about fluoridated water lowering IQs.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.346]  The mayor even took it upon himself to use a single finger to display his current IQ after years of ingesting contaminated water.
[00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:45.369]  And here's an oldie but goodie candid moment from President Barack Obama.
[00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.313]  People have been beaten down so long, and they feel so betrayed by government.
[00:00:52.834 --> 00:01:02.342]  It's not surprising then that they get better if they cling to guns or religion or antithesis or what people want like that.
[00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:09.026]  I know that I've kept a lot of you guys busy this weekend with the comments I made last week.
[00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:12.229]  Some of you might even be a little bitter about that.
[00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:25.070]  Yeah, he said it, made a joke about it, but many people on the street still feel that it's a quote conspiracy theory that there are politicians actively conspiring to take away guns.
[00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:39.417]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently, but because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly.
[00:01:39.437 --> 00:01:40.938]  So you hang on to that.
[00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.771]  And for the sake of time, let's move through some political moments that need no narration.
[00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:48.131]  Who are they?
[00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:58.715]  Are they these extreme conservatives who are right to life, a pro-assault weapon, anti-gay?
[00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:00.596]  Is that who they are?
[00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:08.159]  Because if that's who they are, and if they are the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York.
[00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:13.240]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:15.582]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:19.744]  There was no greeting ceremony and we basically were told to run to our cars.
[00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:20.745]  Now that is what happened.
[00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:21.826]  Thank you.
[00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:27.830]  There was no sniper fire either when Senator Clinton visited two army outposts where she posed for photos.
[00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.511]  Hey John, good job.
[00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:31.612]  Let me know what I can do to help you refrain her.
[00:02:34.156 --> 00:02:42.122]  Listen to what Holder told a Judiciary Committee hearing on May 3rd this year.
[00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:08.500]  I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks.
[00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:17.887]  Yet, internal Justice Department documents show that at least 10 months before that hearing, Holder began receiving frequent memos discussing Fast and Furious.
[00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:21.370]  You have said in the past that it was, quote, pretty well confirmed.
[00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.291]  No, I never said that.
[00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:22.851]  Okay.
[00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:23.792]  I never said that.
[00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:25.213]  I think that is... Absolutely not.
[00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.655]  What I said was, it's been pretty well confirmed.
[00:03:32.737 --> 00:03:37.218]  Since we have you here, we haven't had a chance to kind of talk about some of the... I'm not speaking about anything that's off-topic.
[00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:38.398]  This is only about the President.
[00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.619]  Well, what about... Thank you.
[00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:40.359]  Let me be clear to you.
[00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.959]  You have a DLT identity.
[00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:41.399]  You're not a man.
