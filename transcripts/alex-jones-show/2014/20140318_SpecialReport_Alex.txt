[00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:15.006]  Well, it's that time of year again when reality contestants are so desperate for fame that they're willing to sign their rights away in order to win.
[00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:16.968]  But here's a little reality for you.
[00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.069]  The game is rigged.
[00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.397]  A leaked contract shows contestants for The Voice must agree to being shown in a disparaging, defamatory, and embarrassing light.
[00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:38.306]  The 32-page contract details how producers can cut anyone from the lineup, break and change rules of the competition at their discretion, script winners, and send the talent for psychological tests and then broadcast the results.
[00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:45.852]  The ironclad contract also makes sure that these reality show wannabes can't sue NBC afterward for public humiliation.
[00:00:46.368 --> 00:00:52.555]  According to former Dancing with the Stars contestant and Olympian Hope Solo, that show is also fixed.
[00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.840]  Solo says a secret memo floats around to determine who will be ousted each week.
[00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:02.667]  When she learned her team was on the chopping block, she and her partner caused a little drama during the live segment of the show.
[00:01:03.047 --> 00:01:06.171]  Just so producers couldn't resist keeping them around for the ratings.
[00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:09.775]  Just like Katniss and her flaming suit in The Hunger Games.
[00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:15.041]  But when you don't play by the script, TV execs, producers, and the fans get mad.
[00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:23.390]  Recently, one of the most hated contestants in The Bachelor's history caused outrage when he didn't want to share details of his personal life after the show had ended.
[00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.932]  Even the show host became better toward the star for not playing by the rules.
[00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:27.852]  Express your feelings.
[00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:29.653]  This is the time to shine.
[00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.514]  This is what the show is about.
[00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:37.156]  The show is about somebody meeting someone and falling in love and being happy.
[00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:37.977]  So did you?
[00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:40.138]  I'm with somebody.
[00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:41.318]  I don't know what I'm looking at.
[00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.199]  I don't know what I'm looking at.
[00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.479]  You do!
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.300]  We do!
[00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:46.662]  Let's get real.
[00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:50.943]  All reality programming is meticulously manufactured by the networks.
[00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:53.504]  This mass distraction is big business.
[00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:55.645]  There isn't a game out there that isn't rigged.
[00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:59.567]  Gamblers have been able to get the soccer players to get them to fix matches.
[00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:02.088]  They've been able to get the tennis players, got them to fix matches.
[00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.229]  Cricket players, got them to fix matches.
[00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.890]  They can get to our college athletes and get them to fix matches.
[00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.792]  Why do we believe the NFL, the NBA, the Major League Baseball, all these are immune from such corruption?
[00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:14.673]  When you look around the United States, you see corruption in everything.
[00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:15.814]  I don't know.
[00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.111]  But we don't want to be in a rigged system.
[00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:42.613]  We want a system where the individual is empowered, and the playing field is level.
[00:02:42.793 --> 00:02:51.256]  But when you have a media that prides itself on being fake, you get fake contests, rigged elections, and pseudo-news with teleprompter readers.
[00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:57.639]  Anything can be inserted into the script, and the anchor only needs to be talented enough just to read fiction to the public.
[00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:02.421]  Crash KTVU has just learned the names of the four pilots who are on board the flight.
[00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.302]  They are Captain Sum Ting Wong,
[00:03:17.607 --> 00:03:21.129]  No country in the world idolizes celebrity quite like the U.S.
[00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:25.971]  It's the bread and circuses concept designed to distract us from our real problems.
[00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:31.814]  The Matrix wants you enslaved in its simulation, but it's time to swallow the red pill of reality.
