[00:00:19.773 --> 00:00:21.254]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:22.014]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:23.774]  It's Monday, December 8th, 2014.
[00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.715]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:33.978]  Tonight, riddles surround the 36th banker death of the year.
[00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:38.339]  Then, the controversy at state and national parks.
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.761]  And some speculate the chokehold isn't what killed Eric Gardner.
[00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:48.223]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:49.878 --> 00:00:54.040]  But just the information I have to look at is torture!
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.741]  Because I know how evil the globalists are!
[00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:00.423]  Well, the mortgage crashes were not a mistake, they were a plan.
[00:01:01.023 --> 00:01:06.666]  Even before the ink dried on the bank bailouts, they were looking to extend their derivative markets in all new directions.
[00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:11.068]  And of course, the House Republicans have been more than happy to help them since 2008.
[00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:14.930]  Just last year, look at this report from Kurt Nemo.
[00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:31.287]  He said the House voted to get banksters back in the derivative business, and of course he pointed out that in October of 2013, last year, the House passed a bipartisan tweak to the Dodd-Frank bill that Congress had earlier passed as a reform after the bankers nearly crashed the financial system back in 2008.
[00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:37.214]  And he points out, though, of course, Dodd and Frank were both Democrats, and he points out there's another Democrat.
[00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:46.416]  Jim Hines, Democrat of Connecticut, has received $66,450 from Citigroup, and he's writing the legislation for him.
[00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:50.057]  We're seeing that yet another year passes, and they're trying to do it again.
[00:01:50.137 --> 00:01:55.378]  This time, putting it into the December 11th resolution, trying to get a continuing funding for the government.
[00:01:55.658 --> 00:02:01.520]  As we point out this weekend, Kurt Nemo pointed out, bankster lobbyists tried to sneak derivatives bailout and budget legislation.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.581]  Here we go again.
[00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:06.223]  Kurt pointed out this weekend that Dodd-Frank codified too big to fail.
[00:02:06.503 --> 00:02:07.704]  It hammered small businesses.
[00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:09.505]  It protected bankster investors.
[00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:12.607]  It jacked up the prices consumers pay for bank services.
[00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:14.328]  It interfered with basic market functions.
[00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:19.051]  And it set the stage for the next economic disaster planned by the financial elite.
[00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:20.072]  And how are they going to do that?
[00:02:20.352 --> 00:02:23.894]  Well, of course, they're going to insure additional derivatives.
[00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:26.136]  Tie them into the FDIC.
[00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:28.858]  As we see from this article from Michael Krieger.
[00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:32.341]  Wall Street moves to put taxpayers on the hook for derivative trades.
[00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:41.709]  He showed the actual drafts from Citigroup that have been put forward by their puppet, Jim Hines, and showing the final bill.
[00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:46.494]  And you can see that they have copied it almost verbatim from the city lobbyist.
[00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:52.499]  Now our interview today is with someone who was one of the first whistleblowers back in the SNL crisis of the 1980s.
[00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.984]  He's also done a lot of investigation about this most recent crime of the big banks in the 2000s.
[00:02:58.484 --> 00:03:04.890]  He's laid out the criminal case for tax evasion, tax fraud, security frauds, and he's traced the flow of money
[00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.791]  Through to the Swiss banks and into black operations.
[00:03:08.851 --> 00:03:16.014]  A former military man, he's very concerned about that, as we've also seen with these recent lawsuits from a lot of military vets and their families.
[00:03:16.414 --> 00:03:21.416]  He's also going to offer you a plan of action, a way that you can help to expose these crimes.
[00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:23.097]  He's going to lay that out very thoroughly for us.
[00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:28.459]  Now, it also is pretty clear when you see these bankers at the epicenter of these globalist
[00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.121]  Major crimes and a lot of money being moved around criminally.
[00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.923]  We've seen this year a lot of banker suicides.
[00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:36.363]  We're going to talk about that in the interview as well.
[00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:42.647]  This most recent article that came up this weekend, we now have the 36th dead banker of the year.
[00:03:42.707 --> 00:03:43.848]  Yes, yet another.
[00:03:43.868 --> 00:03:45.709]  36 in one year.
[00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.511]  Very suspicious circumstances for all of these.
[00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:58.137]  Now the other thing we saw this weekend was the public trashing of the reputation of Eric Garner, the man who was choked to death by the police, trashing him as being too fat.
[00:03:58.817 --> 00:04:03.661]  They're not criticizing him for being black, but his fault, the reason he's dead is because he was simply too fat.
[00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:06.384]  Point out the fat shaming of Eric Garner.
[00:04:06.444 --> 00:04:07.425]  This is from The Atlantic.
[00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:20.837]  They say Representative Peter King, a Republican from New York, actually he's from the Staten Island area I believe, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Garner would not have died during an arrest by NYPD officers had he been more physically fit.
[00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:24.080]  He said, you have a 350-pound person who is resisting arrest.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.407]  If he had not had asthma and a heart condition and wasn't so obese, he almost definitely would not have died from this.
[00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:41.037]  So I guess the lesson for all of this is that we need to get into better shape so we can survive the beatings from our slave masters and their overseers.
[00:04:41.738 --> 00:04:47.060]  Actually, the union got into this as well, saying that they're being demonized about this.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.602]  They say, police say the outcry has left them feeling betrayed and demonized by everyone from the president and the mayor to throngs of protesters who scream at them on the street.
[00:04:56.043 --> 00:04:59.604]  And this is what the president of the police union had to say, Patrick Lynch.
[00:04:59.644 --> 00:05:03.145]  He said, police officers feel like they're being thrown under the bus.
[00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:12.756]  Well, I think it's kind of interesting because it was that same fellow, Peter Lynch, who threw the EMS people under the bus back in August.
[00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:18.783]  If you remember, it was very clear from the coroner that it was a case of homicide.
[00:05:19.364 --> 00:05:21.905]  She made it very clear that he was choked to death.
[00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:23.445]  It was trauma to the throat.
[00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:27.726]  And of course, at the time when that was reviewed, they pushed back on that.
[00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:44.029]  Peter Lynch, the head of the police union, said that he thought that, as they looked at these throat injuries, he thought that might be consistent with the type of compression, he said, and damage to the neck and chest, consistent with life-saving techniques that EMS or emergency room technicians would do in a situation like this.
[00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.770]  It's consistent with that, and not consistent with a choke hold.
[00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:59.319]  But when famous forensic pathologist Michael Bodden took a look at this report, he said, there were 10 hemorrhages on the inside of the neck, in the muscles of the neck, hemorrhages in the eye, hemorrhages in the tongue.
[00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:02.061]  All of those are evidence of neck compression.
[00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:04.863]  In other words, this guy was killed.
[00:06:04.944 --> 00:06:08.046]  It was a homicide due to what the police did to his neck.
[00:06:08.386 --> 00:06:12.470]  But of course, the head of the police union throws EMS under the bus.
[00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.030]  What was being said about EMS at the time?
[00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:28.853]  Well, back at the time, in August, the New York Daily News pointed out that four minutes into a seven-minute video clip, four EMTs arrived, but neither they nor the eight cops standing around Garner as he lay on the sidewalk could be seen trying to help the unconscious man.
[00:06:29.253 --> 00:06:29.993]  What did they do?
[00:06:30.353 --> 00:06:34.814]  Did they do something that was consistent with what this police union officer says?
[00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:39.775]  That, you know, these kinds of interventions from EMT would have caused him to have ten
[00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:40.915]  I don't think so.
[00:07:03.402 --> 00:07:08.044]  So we see that a big part of the problem, a big part of the systemic problem, are the police unions.
[00:07:08.304 --> 00:07:14.626]  And they're willing to throw anybody under the bus, willing to blame this man's death on his obesity.
[00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:19.448]  Although, there is a pattern of behavior from this very officer.
[00:07:19.888 --> 00:07:21.369]  Immediately after this happened,
[00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:32.876]  Staten Island Live, SILive.com reported that the city had paid out $30,000 to settle a 2012 lawsuit against chokehold cop Daniel Pantaleo.
[00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.538]  This is the same guy who choked Eric Garner to death.
[00:07:35.798 --> 00:07:39.681]  They had already paid out $30,000 in a similar situation.
[00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:42.823]  We see a pattern of behavior with this particular cop.
[00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:43.543]  I think?
[00:08:02.674 --> 00:08:04.515]  Good for libertarians as well as for Christians.
[00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:13.598]  And we also have a report as Peter Gruber is preparing to go before Congress and talk about how he twisted the data and lied to the American public to deceive them.
[00:08:13.878 --> 00:08:21.041]  We have a report about how he did the same thing and grubered the data about abortions to try to convince people to have abortions.
[00:08:21.361 --> 00:08:22.422]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:26.315]  The Molon Lave Silver Coin.
[00:08:26.596 --> 00:08:28.376]  Certified by the Provident Mint.

[00:08:33.037 --> 00:08:40.699]  Inspired by the legendary Spartan King, Leonidas, and his refusal to lay down arms in defiance of Emperor Xerxes.
[00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.699]  Molon Lave.
[00:08:41.859 --> 00:08:43.540]  That's Greek for come and take it.

[00:10:00.461 --> 00:10:06.127]  Now of course you can't make the GOP actually do anything to stop Obamacare, but you can opt out personally.
[00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:09.050]  We have a solution for Libertarians and for Christians.
[00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.611]  Here it is.
[00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:24.720]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here from InfoWars Nightly News and I want to talk about solutions.
[00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:31.424]  One of the things we talk about a lot on InfoWars.com and in the documentaries and videos that we make here is that you are the solution.
[00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.905]  You have to be part of the solution.
[00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:36.147]  If you wait for others to do it, you're going to be waiting a long time.
[00:10:36.187 --> 00:10:40.090]  You need to stand up and become active and get involved in the game.
[00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:49.579]  One way to do that is by saying no, opting out, like with the TSA, or spending your dollars locally instead of at a big box chain.
[00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:51.120]  These are all ways that you can get involved.
[00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:55.264]  Well, now we have Obamacare, and this is a big medical tyranny thing.
[00:10:55.804 --> 00:10:59.168]  Here's just a little bit of what Alex Jones has to say about Obamacare earlier this year.
[00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:02.242]  Basically, it was a blank check to do whatever they want.
[00:11:02.582 --> 00:11:28.150]  Share all your data, NSA the medical records, federalize it, give it to all these corporate interests, kick people off their existing plans, kick people off that had pre-existing conditions, not cover children, lower the quality of care, double, triple, quadruple prices, shut down small health care divisions and providers, small insurance companies and HMOs, small clinic chains that help the poor.
[00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:33.504]  I come from a family of physicians and healthcare management.
[00:11:33.524 --> 00:11:34.585]  I mean, I know about this stuff.
[00:11:35.025 --> 00:11:36.187]  And I had doctors on.
[00:11:36.247 --> 00:11:37.789]  I had researchers on.
[00:11:38.029 --> 00:11:39.971]  The insurance companies bragged that they wrote it.
[00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:41.553]  They lobbied to get it passed.
[00:11:42.354 --> 00:11:43.955]  The Republican leadership helped write it.
[00:11:44.796 --> 00:11:47.940]  And I said, this is a bipartisan screwjob, and it's really going to hurt people.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.822]  So most of you watching this are going to agree that Obamacare is not a good thing.
[00:11:52.042 --> 00:11:55.064]  It was written by the insurance companies, and you know all the rest.
[00:11:55.844 --> 00:11:59.346]  But what I want to talk about are ways to get around Obamacare, especially the fees.
[00:11:59.506 --> 00:12:02.688]  Because starting in 2015, the fees are going to get bigger.
[00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:04.769]  In fact, here's what it says on healthcare.gov.
[00:12:05.609 --> 00:12:15.674]  If you don't have coverage in 2015, you'll pay the higher of these two amounts, 2% of your yearly household income, or $325 per person for the year.
[00:12:16.234 --> 00:12:18.755]  The maximum penalty per family using this method is $975.
[00:12:20.976 --> 00:12:24.340]  So if you have a family of four, you're going to be paying close to $1,000 in fines for 2015.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.682]  And it's only going to go up.
[00:12:27.042 --> 00:12:28.704]  You've seen the articles on InfoWars.
[00:12:28.924 --> 00:12:35.611]  We've read emails out from people of others out there who've seen their rates rise or have their plans cut.
[00:12:36.592 --> 00:12:37.853]  They've seen prices double.
[00:12:37.893 --> 00:12:42.418]  Some people are paying more for their health insurance than their mortgage on their house.
[00:12:42.738 --> 00:12:43.920]  But you remember what Obama said.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.442]  If you've got health care already, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.
[00:12:49.562 --> 00:12:51.402]  If you like the plan you have, you can keep it.
[00:12:51.782 --> 00:12:53.203]  I intend to keep this promise.
[00:12:53.363 --> 00:12:56.884]  If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[00:12:56.904 --> 00:12:59.745]  If you like your plan and your doctor, you can keep them.
[00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.506]  You'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[00:13:01.766 --> 00:13:04.346]  If you like your plan, you keep your plan.
[00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:08.548]  If you like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.
[00:13:08.568 --> 00:13:11.649]  If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance.
[00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:12.970]  Period.
[00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:13.971]  So what do you do?
[00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:14.912]  Where do you go?
[00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:22.581]  Is there an alternative to this skyrocketing insurance where it's got super high premiums and deductibles that have been calculated never to be reached?
[00:13:23.182 --> 00:13:28.848]  But before we get to these solutions, let's just look at one instance here of insurance companies and their disreputable dealings.
[00:13:29.349 --> 00:13:33.570]  Here's what advocate Dr. Margaret Flowers had to say about the health insurance system in New York State.
[00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:40.511]  I think, looking at our Blue Cross program here, and what they found was that about one out of every five claims was denied just randomly.
[00:13:40.891 --> 00:13:44.292]  Like if five claims come in, they just pull one out and say they're not going to pay this one.
[00:13:44.572 --> 00:13:55.694]  And we have evidence of this in New York from people that worked in these claim offices, that if there was a certain level area of the city, lower income area, they would deny those claims because they knew people didn't have the resources to fight back.
[00:13:56.534 --> 00:14:00.296]  All the more reason to get out of a system that wasn't even designed to help you in the first place.
[00:14:00.316 --> 00:14:03.537]  A little over a year ago, me and my wife had the same problem.
[00:14:03.897 --> 00:14:05.178]  I saw insurance as a scam.
[00:14:05.238 --> 00:14:08.639]  I was sick and tired of paying the high premiums and the deductibles that you can never reach.
[00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:12.100]  And then we heard from a neighbor about a program called Samaritan Ministries.
[00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:16.982]  It was started back in 1994 by Ted Penninger from his home in Washington, Illinois.
[00:14:17.263 --> 00:14:24.786]  The group has since grown to 36,000 member households participating, and they have around $9 million available each month to meet health care needs.
[00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:27.548]  They don't consider themselves health insurance.
[00:14:27.808 --> 00:14:30.630]  What they call it is health sharing, and here's how it works.
[00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:40.439]  Health sharing is a biblical approach to paying for health care based on passages such as Galatians 6 verse 2, which says, So each member commits to sending a set share amount each month.
[00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:44.282]  These shares are sent directly through the mail from one household to another member with needs.
[00:14:51.969 --> 00:14:59.270]  Samaritan Ministries uses a database that randomly matches shares to needs so that sharing is coordinated and that shares go to the appropriate members with the needs.
[00:15:00.342 --> 00:15:05.824]  Our share by the way is just a little over four hundred dollars and that covers a family of five and that's what we pay per month.
[00:15:06.424 --> 00:15:12.266]  One section which I like on their website is called accountability which is a word you do not see on many major health insurance sites.
[00:15:12.986 --> 00:15:21.468]  So I'm taking money out of this bloated giant bureaucracy that we call health care and the insurance system and sending my money directly to people to help them with their medical needs.
[00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:25.510]  It's a great way to participate in your community and just help one another plus
[00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.831]  When you need to use the services, they're there for you.
[00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:33.013]  And by participating in this, I get to bypass those Obamacare fines.
[00:15:33.373 --> 00:15:40.536]  That's right, Samaritan Ministries and a few others I'm going to mention are grandfathered in so they're not beholden to the laws of Obamacare.
[00:15:41.277 --> 00:15:48.340]  Now they do have a questionnaire and a few forms they want you to fill out and they want you to attend church and you have to have your application and any claims signed by a pastor.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.501]  So if you don't attend church, you might want to find one in your area.
[00:15:51.841 --> 00:15:55.503]  And also, you need to take a long look at SamaritanMinistries.org.
[00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:59.905]  It's got all the questions, everything you can answer that I couldn't possibly get to in this report.
[00:16:00.706 --> 00:16:05.388]  Earlier this year, we had an unfortunate incident and it cost us over $600 in medical bills.
[00:16:05.888 --> 00:16:08.829]  After filling out the forms and sending everything in, we got over $500 back.
[00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:17.741]  This was our first experience using Samaritan Ministries, but let me tell you, I feel good about using it and I think you should check it out and really give it a try.
[00:16:17.761 --> 00:16:20.005]  It's a great way to get out of this Obamacare system.
[00:16:21.431 --> 00:16:27.473]  So this is one way you can get out of the system, stop feeding it, take away its fuel, thereby taking away its power.
[00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:29.173]  It's a great way to do it.
[00:16:29.213 --> 00:16:30.634]  Now I'm going to describe a few more here.
[00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:35.315]  The article, Opting Out of Obamacare Through Medical Sharing Ministries, focuses on MediShare.
[00:16:35.716 --> 00:16:39.737]  Founded in 1993, MediShare historically grew at roughly 10% a year.
[00:16:40.077 --> 00:16:46.359]  Since Obamacare passed in 2010, the growth has ticked up to about 15%, as some Americans look to end-run the mandate.
[00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:54.264]  About 150,000 people are members of medical sharing ministries and 60,000 of them belong to MediShare, according to MediShare President CEO Tony Meggs.
[00:16:55.005 --> 00:17:00.528]  The Obamacare fee exemption requires health sharing ministries to have been in operation before December 31st, 1999.
[00:17:01.869 --> 00:17:09.214]  So if you're looking at one that's been around since the 2000s, you may want to take a quick look because they're probably not going to be able to opt out of this Obamacare fee system.
[00:17:10.438 --> 00:17:12.938]  So we've looked at Samaritan Ministries and MediShare.
[00:17:13.218 --> 00:17:16.359]  The final one here is called LibertyHealthShare.org.
[00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:20.160]  They call their system a tried and true cost sharing method that works.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.621]  Liberty HealthShare is a reorganization of an existing group that has been sharing costs since 1988.
[00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:28.661]  They have been operating successfully for decades because it works.
[00:17:29.101 --> 00:17:32.562]  During that period, over $20 million has been shared to meet each other's costs.
[00:17:33.002 --> 00:17:38.103]  Medical cost sharing is currently being used by thousands of families nationwide meeting their health care costs each month.
[00:17:39.195 --> 00:17:40.317]  And you can look on their website.
[00:17:40.357 --> 00:17:43.963]  They have sections like person-to-person sharing, how the funds are used.
[00:17:44.544 --> 00:17:46.767]  They also talk about accountability, which I think is great.
[00:17:47.028 --> 00:17:52.377]  And they have three different option levels you can get into, so I suggest you check those out and see if they meet your needs.
[00:17:53.936 --> 00:18:07.639]  And finally, there's a group out there called GreenInsurance.com, which sets itself up as a co-op, and they have a couple membership levels, and they offer to provide up to 100% alternative medicine coverage for services like acupuncture, cleansing, detoxing, even massage.
[00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:14.281]  But this site looks brand new, so I don't think it's going to qualify for that Obamacare exemption, but you may want to call them and find out, or send them an email.
[00:18:15.444 --> 00:18:16.965]  So there are alternatives out there.
[00:18:17.285 --> 00:18:18.906]  I'm using one of them, and it works for me.
[00:18:18.926 --> 00:18:23.429]  It lets me opt out of Obamacare, and let me tell you, that is one way to defeat the system.
[00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.710]  Thanks for watching.

[00:19:54.104 --> 00:20:06.740]  Well, as John Gruber prepares to go before Congress and explain why he tortured the Dato, why he deceived the American public, we find that he also was groovering the data to convince people to have abortions as well.
[00:20:07.381 --> 00:20:08.022]  Here's that story.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:32.727]  Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber is not just satisfied with selling the two stupid American voters a healthcare law based on deception and non-transparency.
[00:20:33.247 --> 00:20:39.892]  No, now Gruber has been exposed as an abortion advocate of the eugenicist variety.
[00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:47.257]  Now, during the Clinton years, Gruber co-authored a paper titled, Abortion Legalization and Child Living Circumstances.
[00:20:47.737 --> 00:20:49.620]  Who is the marginal child?
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.264]  He argues that legal abortion had saved the U.S.
[00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:59.773]  taxpayer upwards of $14 billion in welfare benefits and that it also lowered crime.
[00:21:00.234 --> 00:21:04.479]  He argues that abortion of marginal children is a social good.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:18.488]  If these marginal children, or urban poor, had been born, they would have been more likely to live in a single parent household, live in poverty, die in infancy, and be in a household collecting welfare.
[00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:22.931]  I was raised by a single mother in low to middle class neighborhood.
[00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:25.592]  I even grew up some of those years on food stamps.
[00:21:26.033 --> 00:21:31.216]  But according to Jonathan Gruber, I would have been better off if I had never even been born.
[00:21:31.636 --> 00:21:43.045]  And this is a lie that they sell to these young women that they might as well just get rid of their children because they'll never be able to make it and they'll never rise up out of poverty, they won't amount to anything, they won't be able to afford it.
[00:21:43.466 --> 00:21:45.467]  So this is just a huge lie.
[00:21:46.068 --> 00:21:52.833]  And let's point out that this is the same exact man who's in charge of drafting our national health care law.
[00:21:53.334 --> 00:21:55.395]  So, you know, no need to worry about death panels.
[00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:56.916]  And also, remember this?
[00:21:57.397 --> 00:22:01.060]  There are also those who claim that our reform efforts would ensure illegal immigrants.
[00:22:02.796 --> 00:22:04.357]  This, too, is false.
[00:22:05.497 --> 00:22:11.280]  The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.
[00:22:15.822 --> 00:22:16.583]  It's not true.
[00:22:18.343 --> 00:22:21.645]  And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up.
[00:22:22.866 --> 00:22:23.526]  Under our plan,
[00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:30.735]  No federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.
[00:22:31.095 --> 00:22:32.655]  Turns out that was a lie.
[00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:44.859]  According to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, Obamacare is filled with abortion subsidies and plans that indirectly fund the procedure, forcing taxpayers to subsidize abortion.
[00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:51.721]  And as we've reported before, most of these abortion clinics are set up in black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
[00:22:52.665 --> 00:22:57.729]  In New York alone, there were more black babies killed by abortion than were born in 2012.
[00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:05.414]  And in New York alone, nearly 78% of all abortions performed were of black or Hispanic children.
[00:23:06.034 --> 00:23:10.778]  Former abortion clinic director Carol Everett exposed that the industry
[00:23:11.198 --> 00:23:17.389]  ...seeks to find a constant stream of new clientele by infiltrating public school systems.
[00:23:17.749 --> 00:23:24.421]  And she also revealed how they specifically seek to target the fastest growing minority groups.
[00:23:25.262 --> 00:23:27.423]  Well, I want you to think of this as a business.
[00:23:27.703 --> 00:23:31.044]  People don't think of it as a business, but they have to expand their market.
[00:23:31.064 --> 00:23:32.084]  And who is their market?
[00:23:32.104 --> 00:23:33.684]  It's the woman who's having an abortion.
[00:23:34.164 --> 00:23:38.465]  And so who is the longest-term customer for an abortion clinic?
[00:23:38.986 --> 00:23:45.407]  It's a woman early in her teens who is going to continue using abortion as a method of birth control throughout her childbearing years.
[00:23:46.027 --> 00:23:47.508]  So they go into the schools.
[00:23:48.368 --> 00:23:50.929]  Our goal was three to five abortions between the ages of 13 and 18.
[00:23:52.632 --> 00:23:56.275]  You cannot just go to these kids when they're 12 and say, I want you to start getting pregnant.
[00:23:56.435 --> 00:24:06.562]  So what we did was we worked to create our market by breaking down the natural modesty, separating the children from their parents and their values, and becoming a sexpert in their lives.
[00:24:06.622 --> 00:24:08.183]  My commission was $25.
[00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:12.446]  My goal was 40,000 abortions a year so I could be a millionaire.
[00:24:12.887 --> 00:24:13.207]  Wow.
[00:24:13.227 --> 00:24:14.428]  Last month I was there, we did 545.
[00:24:14.468 --> 00:24:14.988]  My income was $13,625.
[00:24:19.216 --> 00:24:26.400]  Were they specifically targeting minority groups here in the public schools to get them to become these repeat clients?
[00:24:28.181 --> 00:24:30.903]  We just have to look at where their facilities are located.
[00:24:31.123 --> 00:24:31.343]  Right.
[00:24:31.903 --> 00:24:37.927]  Until recently, there was not a single abortion clinic located in a white middle class area.
[00:24:37.987 --> 00:24:41.089]  They were all located in black areas.
[00:24:41.749 --> 00:24:41.809]  In 1984,
[00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:52.937]  Planned Parenthood came to San Antonio, Texas and hired a Hispanic marketing firm to learn how to market to the Hispanic population, i.e.
[00:24:52.957 --> 00:24:59.322]  the fastest growing in the nation and the fastest growing in the abortion numbers and in the teen pregnancy numbers.
[00:25:10.003 --> 00:25:16.304]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:25:16.664 --> 00:25:18.145]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:25:18.165 --> 00:25:19.545]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:25:19.825 --> 00:25:20.925]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:25:21.485 --> 00:25:26.246]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:26.366 --> 00:25:30.467]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:25:39.977 --> 00:25:40.818]  The facts are in.
[00:25:41.018 --> 00:25:42.139]  The studies are legion.
[00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:49.766]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:25:49.926 --> 00:25:53.390]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.170]  Simple.
[00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.755]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:25:59.055 --> 00:26:02.278]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:26:02.458 --> 00:26:04.480]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:10.126]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:26:10.306 --> 00:26:20.796]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:26:21.096 --> 00:26:22.938]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:26:23.038 --> 00:26:25.301]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[00:26:25.642 --> 00:26:27.504]  I use fluoride shield every day.

[00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:37.638]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[00:26:37.798 --> 00:26:39.080]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[00:26:41.109 --> 00:26:41.729]  Audit the Fed?
[00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.471]  How about starting by auditing your own mortgage?
[00:26:45.892 --> 00:26:47.693]  That's what our guest today, Greg Morse, did.
[00:26:48.033 --> 00:26:50.094]  Now he's somebody, this is not his first rodeo.
[00:26:50.114 --> 00:26:52.495]  He got his start back in the SNL crisis of the 1980s.
[00:26:52.596 --> 00:26:58.039]  He was one of the first investigators to find out what was going on with the fraud that was committed at that time.
[00:26:58.479 --> 00:26:59.900]  It's a different time today.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.723]  People can violate the law and not have to pay a penalty.
[00:27:03.963 --> 00:27:05.744]  But we have some actionable items for you.
[00:27:06.085 --> 00:27:15.493]  What he found when he looked at his own mortgage was 1,000 incidents of criminal and civil statutes that had been violated in just his mortgage.
[00:27:15.993 --> 00:27:25.201]  Now this is a story that hits at the heart of the corruption with the mega bankers, of course, who are enslaving us, who are robbing us, who are sending us to war.
[00:27:25.521 --> 00:27:35.529]  This is a story that starts the break of the chain of title, that starts with a complete disillusion of our property records, our system of property records, the fraud inherent in that.
[00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:42.916]  The largest case of tax fraud, the largest case of security fraud, the largest bankruptcy case ever.
[00:27:43.496 --> 00:27:58.631]  All of these things are part of this story that we're going to cover and of course it leads from the beginning of your mortgage and the breaking of the chain of title up through the Federal Reserve to Swiss banks to black operations that are funded out of that money that is then hidden.
[00:27:59.252 --> 00:28:00.773]  So we're going to give you a plan of action.
[00:28:00.813 --> 00:28:12.242]  We're going to tell you what you can do to basically kick the globalist bankers in the nuts and to do something about throwing their employees on Capitol Hill in jail.
[00:28:12.603 --> 00:28:14.504]  Joining me on the phone tonight is Greg Morris.
[00:28:14.524 --> 00:28:15.125]  Now Greg's a
[00:28:15.765 --> 00:28:18.006]  Former F-4 Phantom driver for the U.S.
[00:28:18.046 --> 00:28:18.706]  Air Force, U.S.
[00:28:18.726 --> 00:28:20.986]  Navy, and a lieutenant commander for the U.S.
[00:28:21.006 --> 00:28:21.226]  Navy.
[00:28:21.246 --> 00:28:26.448]  He was self-employed for 30 years in real estate, all areas of aviation industry as well.
[00:28:27.088 --> 00:28:33.130]  And, this is key, he was one of a very small group that uncovered the savings and loan crisis in 1985.
[00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:41.612]  Tell us a little bit about what you discovered back in 1985, because that has some bearing on how you got back involved with this particular instance.
[00:28:42.868 --> 00:29:02.678]  David, what we found was that back in those days, the S&L entities were prone to lying about their economics to the public on their reports with, at that time, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, similar to the FDIC for banks.
[00:29:03.498 --> 00:29:07.320]  And what they were doing is they had two sets of books, basically.
[00:29:09.111 --> 00:29:20.025]  Telling the world that the picture for their institution economically was one thing, when in fact the reality on the second set of books was something totally different.
[00:29:20.697 --> 00:29:24.979]  Now, you got involved in this at the very beginning because of your personal issues.
[00:29:25.239 --> 00:29:32.002]  You were working at the bank to finance an aviation business that you were working on at the time, and you found out that your bank was insolvent, right?
[00:29:32.503 --> 00:29:44.228]  Yeah, they were claiming they were a billion-plus in the black, and in fact, when we went over and got involved with FISLIC over in Las Colinas, over in the Mid-Cities area of Dallas, they were over $400 million in the red.
[00:29:46.569 --> 00:29:50.212]  In the late 2000s, you had some people contact you and ask you if you would look into this.
[00:29:50.252 --> 00:29:55.216]  You weren't directly involved because you didn't have a loan that was in default, but they asked you to take a look at this, right?
[00:29:55.937 --> 00:29:56.657]  That's correct.
[00:29:56.717 --> 00:30:03.263]  I had a home mortgage, but at that point I was basically retired, David, and the only thing I had was a current note, never late.
[00:30:03.943 --> 00:30:11.889]  What we found and have documented on our website, in my singular mortgage, we identified over 1,000
[00:30:14.398 --> 00:30:24.766]  Individually documented and legally cited events of either outright fraud or statute
[00:30:26.109 --> 00:30:33.993]  Okay, now I want to go over the tax fraud issues, the security fraud issues, what's going on in the bankruptcy court.
[00:30:34.013 --> 00:30:38.316]  And as I pointed out in the introduction, this is the largest tax fraud case ever.
[00:30:38.496 --> 00:30:40.337]  It's the largest security fraud we've ever seen.
[00:30:40.617 --> 00:30:42.678]  And of course, the largest bankruptcy we've ever seen.
[00:30:43.218 --> 00:30:48.401]  And this ties into black operations, terrorist events, overthrows of government.
[00:30:48.421 --> 00:30:49.681]  We want to get into all that.
[00:30:49.721 --> 00:30:50.502]  That's the big picture.
[00:30:50.522 --> 00:30:52.203]  But let's take it a little bit at a time.
[00:30:52.223 --> 00:30:54.164]  Let's first go to the tax fraud issue.
[00:30:54.844 --> 00:31:00.325]  Explain the significance of the fact that you filed a RICO civil lawsuit in three states.
[00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:01.265]  Why did you do that for?
[00:31:02.366 --> 00:31:16.529]  We filed it because we've had a federal civil pro se, meaning I represent myself, lawsuit filed initially in the Eastern District of Texas Federal District Court.
[00:31:17.449 --> 00:31:21.850]  What we have found, since we've been at it for almost three and a half years now,
[00:31:23.038 --> 00:31:36.271]  The case has promulgated into being in three different courts in three different states, and as of today, we still have not been allowed to have our first hearing of any kind.
[00:31:37.385 --> 00:31:57.049]  So what they've attempted to do clearly, and it's all on the docket, we can prove every single word we're saying with court-entered documents on the court dockets, is that they don't want the evidence, which now exceeds 15,000 pages, they don't want that evidence coming out.
[00:31:57.689 --> 00:32:09.222]  So what they've tried to do is to play the shuffle off the Buffalo country boy kick the can routine with us by judges lying, lawyers lying, submitting fraudulent documents.
[00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:10.423]  Then we challenge them.
[00:32:10.463 --> 00:32:12.806]  They had been on the record that yes, they did.
[00:32:13.446 --> 00:32:14.947]  Submit fraudulent documents.
[00:32:15.028 --> 00:32:15.668]  We're sorry.
[00:32:15.708 --> 00:32:22.854]  We didn't think you really wanted us to tell the truth, but now that you're motioning us for sanctions and motions to compel, now we'll give you the real truth.
[00:32:23.194 --> 00:32:33.442]  So they've been trying to keep me, in addition to the threats and all the rest of the malarkey that goes with it, they've been attempting to keep this case from coming out into the public.
[00:32:33.842 --> 00:32:34.863]  Not because of me.
[00:32:34.963 --> 00:32:36.184]  This is not about my case.
[00:32:36.604 --> 00:32:40.908]  This is about the fact that we have been able to take what we learned
[00:32:41.548 --> 00:32:41.869]  I think?
[00:32:58.028 --> 00:33:14.399]  In recorded history, and thirdly, a significant percentage, and until we were to under legal auspices or the joint congressional hearing that we're pressing for, got there, got the hard drives of data from the other entities involved, David.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:22.585]  I can't give you an exact percentage or dollar amount, but many of the dollars that were stolen from the American public
[00:33:23.647 --> 00:33:33.915]  Through the mortgage crisis, found their way through the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation at 55 Water Street and Wall Street.
[00:33:34.456 --> 00:33:45.104]  They went from there to the Federal Reserve, then to the Union Bank of Switzerland, and many of those funds have been used to proffer terrorist activities and black ops.
[00:33:45.464 --> 00:33:46.944]  And we've got your website up there right now.
[00:33:47.024 --> 00:33:48.225]  Give us that website address.
[00:33:49.405 --> 00:33:50.225]  We have two of them.
[00:33:50.245 --> 00:33:53.146]  It's SaveOurFamilyAndHome.com.
[00:33:53.166 --> 00:33:54.186]  That's what we're seeing right now.
[00:33:54.546 --> 00:33:56.727]  That's our evidence repository.
[00:33:56.847 --> 00:34:04.809]  And then RedPillReports.com is our news marketing organization that communicates everything we're doing.
[00:34:05.342 --> 00:34:12.104]  Now one of the things I said in the introduction was this even touches on possibly on some of these banker suicides.
[00:34:12.144 --> 00:34:17.967]  We've seen a rash of banker suicides at a time when these guys are doing really well.
[00:34:18.227 --> 00:34:24.209]  It's not like it's the Depression where they're jumping out of windows, but a lot of people have died under mysterious circumstances.
[00:34:24.549 --> 00:34:27.430]  But I want to go to this, and that is Brad Birkenfeld.
[00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:39.776]  Now, he got $104 million from the IRS for exposing secretive banking operations and tax evasions involving UBS and the Swiss banking system.
[00:34:40.117 --> 00:34:44.039]  That all came about because of Brad Birkenfeld's whistleblowing.
[00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:49.201]  Yet, when he came to the Department of Justice with this information, nobody went to jail.
[00:34:49.462 --> 00:34:55.565]  Even after all this came to light, nobody went to jail except for the whistleblower himself, Brad Birkenfeld.
[00:34:55.805 --> 00:34:58.148]  That's where he met Scott Bennett in prison.
[00:34:58.348 --> 00:35:00.230]  Scott Bennett was in the Army.
[00:35:00.271 --> 00:35:01.712]  He was with Booz Allen Hamilton.
[00:35:01.953 --> 00:35:05.056]  Blew the whistle on some of the things that he discovered to his superiors.
[00:35:05.297 --> 00:35:08.741]  He was sent to jail, I believe, on some trumped-up charges that look pretty phony.
[00:35:08.981 --> 00:35:12.786]  They spent six months living together in this white-collar...
[00:35:13.466 --> 00:35:14.127]  We're good to go.
[00:35:34.942 --> 00:35:37.986]  They are obviously running to hide.
[00:35:38.286 --> 00:35:54.965]  They do not want this coming out in any way, and they're doing everything they can to either not respond to Scott, or in my case, we've had four formal responses from four of the largest government agencies
[00:35:55.525 --> 00:35:56.226]  We're good to go.
[00:36:16.963 --> 00:36:21.645]  As he got out, he was handed a check for $104 million from the IRS for being a whistleblower.
[00:36:22.045 --> 00:36:33.209]  And after they had convicted him, the prosecutor, Kevin Downey, said that he needed the judge to give him some more time with the whistleblower because he was getting so much key intel from him.
[00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:35.630]  Don't take him away and send him to jail just yet.
[00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.571]  So admitted that it was very important.
[00:36:37.811 --> 00:36:42.333]  Now one of the things that I want to pull out, which again, hits possibly to these banker suicides,
[00:36:42.873 --> 00:36:43.033]  Yes.
[00:37:03.874 --> 00:37:26.032]  That was in the name of this London friend who didn't know anything about this because Brad Birkenfeld had done this secretively, had traveled there secretly to talk to the Department of Justice, yet somebody who knew that he had talked to the Department of Justice had contacted UBS in the name of this friend who didn't know anything about it, presumably hoping that UBS would do something about it or do something to him, I presume.
[00:37:26.052 --> 00:37:31.616]  But yet, they call this London friend who was absolutely astonished and then called Birkenfeld for an explanation.
[00:37:31.636 --> 00:37:32.357]  You want to comment on that?
[00:37:33.436 --> 00:37:50.193]  I'd rather, quite frankly, I'd rather let Scott at a later date go into all that detail because he was much closer to the topic than I. What I can tell you is that if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, let's don't shy away from making the ultimate conclusionary statement.
[00:37:50.213 --> 00:37:51.154]  That is, it's a duck.
[00:37:51.655 --> 00:37:55.419]  These guys are covering this up because they know we're on their trail.
[00:37:55.959 --> 00:38:05.660]  They're afraid of it and they don't know how to stop it because we're in a position now where they cannot stop us from getting all the way to the Supreme Court and going to the Congress of the United States.
[00:38:06.863 --> 00:38:10.084]  Greg, let's get down to some of the details of this tax evasion issue.
[00:38:10.104 --> 00:38:11.904]  And of course, at the heart of it is MERS.
[00:38:12.004 --> 00:38:15.065]  And we've talked to Dave Krieger about Clouded Title.
[00:38:15.085 --> 00:38:16.265]  He's the author of Clouded Title.
[00:38:16.305 --> 00:38:23.207]  We've talked about how they break the chain of title, how they evade taxes at the local county level.
[00:38:23.227 --> 00:38:31.109]  And of course, we all have to make up that tax revenue that the bankers don't pay when they break the chain of title and they securitize these instruments.
[00:38:31.429 --> 00:38:33.190]  But that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:45.575]  That's the key to the tax evasion and it gets down to something that I think a lot of people may not understand and that is the REMICS that were created in the late 1980s, Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit.
[00:38:46.196 --> 00:38:51.118]  Tell us a little bit about how that is at the core of the tax issue, the REMICS.
[00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:55.160]  Okay, it's real simple and I'm going to keep it very short.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.681]  The procedure goes like this.
[00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:05.032]  You buy your house, it gets co-mingled into a trust, just an outright trust.
[00:39:05.932 --> 00:39:16.435]  Typically, of the thousands and thousands that were developed, they were, for the most part, all done under the trust laws of the state of New York, for obvious reasons, which we'll talk about.
[00:39:17.475 --> 00:39:24.317]  What would happen is that when those trusts were cleared out, meaning they said, we've got enough in this one trust,
[00:39:25.319 --> 00:39:31.765]  What would happen is they would typically file reports with the SEC for anywhere from 9 to 15 months.
[00:39:33.446 --> 00:39:44.716]  At the end of that period, they would file another SEC form, and I'm not going to quote the forms because I don't want to confuse people with all the technical intricacy, but they would file a form, David.
[00:39:45.396 --> 00:39:48.079]  It is not a form that requires review.
[00:39:49.168 --> 00:39:54.072]  Scrutiny or approval by anybody at the IRS or the SEC.
[00:39:54.452 --> 00:39:55.713]  It's a simple filing.
[00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:58.956]  They file this form and they say two things.
[00:39:58.996 --> 00:39:59.697]  Well, three things.
[00:40:00.077 --> 00:40:02.419]  One, we now have less than 300 owners
[00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:05.226]  Yeah.
[00:40:24.949 --> 00:40:31.631]  Yeah, and let's point out that when they say they don't have to pay any tax, they made the argument that they were getting double taxation.
[00:40:31.831 --> 00:40:34.492]  Every corporation has and can make that argument.
[00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:42.294]  A lot of people have said we need to stop taxing corporations and businesses because that's just an invisible tax that's passed along to consumers, like a VAT tax.
[00:40:42.674 --> 00:40:45.575]  So fine, they're getting taxed double taxation, but the only people
[00:40:46.075 --> 00:40:53.437]  They get relief from double taxation are, of course, the bankers who have these employees in Washington called congressmen and senators.
[00:40:53.797 --> 00:41:04.021]  So they pass this REMIC construct, which says basically, as you just pointed out, they can make an assertion, file a piece of paper and say, we're no longer under your supervision, we don't have to pay taxes.
[00:41:04.181 --> 00:41:12.203]  But the key thing is that they have a clear, one of the key things, provisions of this REMIC, is that they have to have a clear chain of title in these mortgages.
[00:41:12.584 --> 00:41:13.864]  Once they break that chain of title,
[00:41:14.224 --> 00:41:16.746]  Now they are liable to taxes.
[00:41:17.326 --> 00:41:19.667]  Now you're hitting it spot on.
[00:41:19.768 --> 00:41:20.648]  Here's the issue.
[00:41:21.208 --> 00:41:27.993]  There are two classifications of mortgages that surface in these trusts.
[00:41:28.213 --> 00:41:31.995]  One is called a qualifying mortgage and the other one is a non-qualifying mortgage.
[00:41:32.556 --> 00:41:37.339]  Now, to be a qualified mortgage, there are a number of requirements.
[00:41:37.439 --> 00:41:42.562]  The first and most important of which is the fact that the chain of title is not broken.
[00:41:42.802 --> 00:41:58.102]  And we don't really have to even go any further into the details of that because we've got a lot of stuff to cover, but that right there says that they are asserting that they don't have to pay taxes, but they themselves broke the chain of title and now they are due to pay those taxes, but they're evading that.
[00:41:58.502 --> 00:42:03.924]  Now, I want to get to what happened when you, because you filed whistleblower status on the tax fraud.
[00:42:04.205 --> 00:42:10.127]  You filed with the SEC about security fraud, but I want to lay out the basis of both of those before we get the reaction of those.
[00:42:10.707 --> 00:42:17.530]  One thing I want to tell the audience, and I got this from the American Bar Association's website, talking about MERS.
[00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.912]  They say MERS is a separate corporation, of course, acting solely
[00:42:21.352 --> 00:42:22.033]  I think so.
[00:42:40.493 --> 00:42:41.974]  Was not modified by Congress.
[00:42:42.034 --> 00:42:46.658]  And so they're just, they created their own rules, their own laws, their own organizations.
[00:42:46.958 --> 00:42:48.960]  It was the banks who created MERS.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.883]  It was the banks who created DTCC that we're going to talk about here in just a moment.
[00:42:54.344 --> 00:42:55.264]  But then they point out this.
[00:42:55.284 --> 00:43:02.030]  They said this would cause REMICS, what we're talking about, breaking the chain of title, this would cause those REMICS to lose their preferred tax status.
[00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:06.193]  Surprisingly, the American Bar Association says, surprisingly however,
[00:43:06.733 --> 00:43:10.615]  The IRS appears to be unresponsive to the issue so far.
[00:43:11.275 --> 00:43:15.817]  And this failure probably contributed to the financial crisis to some extent.
[00:43:16.337 --> 00:43:16.857]  You think so?
[00:43:17.277 --> 00:43:17.938]  What do you think, Greg?
[00:43:18.758 --> 00:43:23.340]  I think that's a well-chosen set of politically correct terms.
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.060]  Yeah.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:24.260]  Yeah.
[00:43:54.464 --> 00:44:03.035]  You can clearly prove that by going to the Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored enterprise that's bankrupt that's now owned by the federal government who owns
[00:44:03.903 --> 00:44:07.345]  Theoretically, you're at least promissory note.
[00:44:07.465 --> 00:44:19.693]  As soon as you break the promissory note from the deed of trust under Carpenter v. Longin, they cannot be reattached without an act of the court with the compliance of the homeowner.
[00:44:19.954 --> 00:44:22.295]  That means once it's dead, it's dead.
[00:44:22.876 --> 00:44:29.140]  That means that when the chains of title are broken, they're no longer qualified to be in a trust.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.201]  Then when they make the tax
[00:44:33.703 --> 00:44:33.963]  I want to
[00:45:02.842 --> 00:45:03.102]  Thank you.
[00:45:21.334 --> 00:45:21.714]  That's right.
[00:45:37.685 --> 00:45:41.369]  DTCC settled the vast majority of security transactions U.S.
[00:45:41.409 --> 00:45:45.272]  close to $1.7 quadrillion in value.
[00:45:45.352 --> 00:45:46.053]  Did it worldwide.
[00:45:46.373 --> 00:45:51.258]  In 2007 alone, they settled transactions worth $513 trillion.
[00:45:51.698 --> 00:45:54.441]  They processed 325 million book entry deliveries.
[00:45:55.041 --> 00:45:59.225]  And they retained custody of three and a half million security issues worth about $40
[00:46:00.166 --> 00:46:02.448]  Trillion, including securities issued in the U.S.
[00:46:02.888 --> 00:46:04.709]  and more than 100 other countries.
[00:46:04.729 --> 00:46:06.490]  That's why this is an international story.
[00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:13.895]  This isn't something that just affects homeowners in the United States, but it affects investors who are domestic, investors who are abroad.
[00:46:14.215 --> 00:46:19.959]  Let's talk now about this other creation besides MERS that they created as they were changing all the rules.
[00:46:20.399 --> 00:46:21.600]  And I think this is key, Greg.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.122]  This is not something that just happened.
[00:46:24.582 --> 00:46:26.563]  We have been saying this all along.
[00:46:26.643 --> 00:46:28.083]  Many people have been saying this all along.
[00:46:28.383 --> 00:46:33.385]  Of course, the collapse in the mortgage industry wasn't something that just happened.
[00:46:33.845 --> 00:46:46.610]  This was built up, deliberately created with these illegal constructs, changing the rules of the game, doing this without any oversight, pumping the industry up, and then bursting the bubble, and then getting bailed out.
[00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:47.490]  And that's what we see now.
[00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:48.971]  But we're going to go even further than this.
[00:46:49.011 --> 00:46:51.472]  As you point out, we're going to follow this all the way into the black ops.
[00:46:51.952 --> 00:46:55.534]  Talk about DTCC, talk about their connection to the Federal Reserve.
[00:46:57.996 --> 00:47:04.199]  They're the single largest, most powerful private entity who sits on the Federal Reserve, i.e.
[00:47:04.239 --> 00:47:05.840]  they control the Federal Reserve.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.601]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[00:47:09.505 --> 00:47:13.211]  Talk about how you've seen, we see the securities fraud, right?
[00:47:13.251 --> 00:47:22.786]  Because if we start out with fraudulent documents and they sell these fraudulent documents where they don't really have a perfected chain of title, that's security fraud, right?
[00:47:23.306 --> 00:47:23.567]  Correct.
[00:47:25.129 --> 00:47:44.240]  So, now you've taken this information, you filed a whistleblower status with both the IRS and the SEC because they both have programs where if somebody sees illegal activity, there is a legal procedure that you followed, you got recognized by that to say, I've seen problems here, here's the details, you sent them a ton of information, tell us about that.
[00:47:45.712 --> 00:47:54.955]  The only thing we've received from the IRS and the SEC are legal notifications saying that our filings are in compliance with law, and they will, when they get around to it, take a look at it.
[00:47:55.195 --> 00:48:00.136]  This is a huge crime, and we've seen a lot of bankers, they've been ruled suicides.
[00:48:00.316 --> 00:48:07.719]  You're exposing the largest tax evasion case, the largest security frauds case, and you're involved in the largest bankruptcy case.
[00:48:08.059 --> 00:48:11.620]  You've had some pushback personally also, haven't you?
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:17.807]  Oh yeah, death threats, personal attacks, house break-ins, vehicle defamations, all kinds of things.
[00:48:17.927 --> 00:48:19.449]  Yeah, they're doing everything they can.
[00:48:19.729 --> 00:48:25.816]  And it's all SOG stuff, it's not Bloods and Crips, it's all Special Operations Group coming out of Langley.
[00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:27.117]  Tells
[00:48:57.017 --> 00:48:57.077]  Yes.
[00:48:57.097 --> 00:48:57.157]  Yes.
[00:49:16.115 --> 00:49:16.215]  Yes.
[00:49:33.464 --> 00:49:33.824]  We're good to go.
[00:49:56.778 --> 00:50:00.941]  They've now declared bankruptcy 51 entities, the largest bankruptcy in history.
[00:50:01.141 --> 00:50:04.104]  You sent all this information to the bankruptcy judge there, and what did he do?
[00:50:04.944 --> 00:50:09.968]  The bankruptcy judge, Judge Martin Glenn, said, I'm not going to look at this evidence.
[00:50:10.808 --> 00:50:13.010]  Now, you have standing because of the RICO statutes.
[00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:16.873]  That's part of why you filed these RICO lawsuits, I should say.
[00:50:16.893 --> 00:50:18.134]  That's part of why you filed them.
[00:50:18.729 --> 00:50:31.218]  Yes, and it is illegal for him not to accept and put on the docket our evidence, which we did eventually get done, but not because the judge was allowing himself to behave in a legal, ethical, proper manner.
[00:50:31.639 --> 00:50:41.466]  Okay, and one more thing I want to cover on the bankruptcy thing, and then we'll get to the action item here, and that is what's happening with Berkshire Hathaway, our favorite billionaire Warren Buffett,
[00:50:42.166 --> 00:50:42.266]  And
[00:50:58.203 --> 00:51:05.724]  There's $400 billion worth of mortgages that it looks like they're going to get for $5 billion.
[00:51:05.764 --> 00:51:09.545]  That's not even pennies on the dollar, that's for like one cent on the dollar.
[00:51:09.565 --> 00:51:12.666]  But there's something else that's even more important than that.
[00:51:13.046 --> 00:51:17.387]  Tell us about the way they can shield the information with this and why they would want to do that.
[00:51:18.147 --> 00:51:19.207]  Well, it's real simple.
[00:51:19.407 --> 00:51:22.588]  It gives them the ability, David, to cover up their fraud.
[00:51:22.948 --> 00:51:24.868]  Judge Martin Glenn has already
[00:51:25.775 --> 00:51:29.356]  found and ordered that Berkshire Hathaway, i.e.
[00:51:29.396 --> 00:51:35.737]  Warren Buffett, and Aquan Loan Servicing are turned what's called bankruptcy remote.
[00:51:36.918 --> 00:51:47.620]  That means when they buy this 400 plus billion dollars worth of mortgages that affect, I think it's 2,200 and something total mortgages, because we broke this case.
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:52.181]  I was the first one that went after this because I knew what was going on.
[00:51:52.201 --> 00:51:54.462]  I was a party to it and I challenged them.
[00:51:54.821 --> 00:51:55.241]  I think so.
[00:52:10.456 --> 00:52:24.813]  Classified as bankruptcy remote, which means that you, David, if you find out that your mortgage has somehow been compromised, which you can tell by going to our website, clicking on the link at the top of the page that says, how was your mortgage compromised?
[00:52:24.913 --> 00:52:27.376]  We lead you right to it in about 28 steps.
[00:52:27.676 --> 00:52:28.677]  Takes you 30 minutes.
[00:52:28.757 --> 00:52:30.079]  It'll give you some great insight.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:45.420]  What happens is that means that you cannot and you do not have any legal standing to go after Berkshire Hathaway or Aqua Loan Servicing and they're hiding behind the signature of Judge Martin Glenn on that bankruptcy court order.
[00:52:46.161 --> 00:52:55.706]  But, fraudulent bankruptcy doesn't offer that kind of privacy, so that can be penetrated if we can prove the fraud.
[00:52:55.746 --> 00:53:08.113]  And just as a quick aside before we move on to the action thing, one of the reasons you said that you believe that it was something that was transferred without a competitive process was because they were trying to distribute the assets even before they really had trustees in place, correct?
[00:53:08.693 --> 00:53:15.338]  Yes, on day one when they filed a petition, they filed a motion which asked the judge before the trustees were even in place.
[00:53:16.478 --> 00:53:21.362]  And of course, I know a little bit about bankruptcy court because I was involved in one as a creditor.
[00:53:22.062 --> 00:53:25.985]  I know that the trustees working for the court, they get a commission on this.
[00:53:26.005 --> 00:53:30.348]  It's an incentive to try to liquidate this stuff as quickly as possible.
[00:53:30.728 --> 00:53:35.131]  Whoever does this is probably going to make hundreds of millions of dollars, whoever that bankruptcy trustee is.
[00:53:35.151 --> 00:53:36.512]  He's going to make a lot of money off this.
[00:53:36.772 --> 00:53:38.173]  Now, let's get to the action items.
[00:53:38.693 --> 00:53:40.015]  How can people get involved?
[00:53:40.035 --> 00:53:48.825]  You already said they can go to your website, they can look up and see what the status of their mortgage is, but how can people get involved and take them down?
[00:53:49.571 --> 00:53:58.358]  Okay, you either go to SaveOurFamilyAndHome.com, great big button on the top of the home page, or you go to RedPillReports.com.
[00:53:58.698 --> 00:54:00.399]  Same thing, click on the link.
[00:54:00.499 --> 00:54:11.888]  It will take you to a demand jurisdictionally sound petition, which is claiming on our behalf that we are demanding, based on our evidence,
[00:54:13.306 --> 00:54:24.359]  Open joint congressional hearings in front of the media, the public, and all members of the joint seated House and Congress.
[00:54:24.659 --> 00:54:25.360]  House and Senate.
[00:54:26.351 --> 00:54:28.212]  Okay, now why do you think that's going to work?
[00:54:28.252 --> 00:54:31.773]  I mean, we've had a massive demonstration.
[00:54:31.793 --> 00:54:37.495]  We had half a million people show up back in 2009 on September 12th in Washington protesting the Baker fraud.
[00:54:37.535 --> 00:54:38.895]  I mean, they were angry about it.
[00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:40.916]  They said, we don't want this bailout.
[00:54:40.936 --> 00:54:43.016]  We don't have to pay for their quote-unquote mistakes.
[00:54:43.297 --> 00:54:43.977]  It wasn't a mistake.
[00:54:44.217 --> 00:54:45.017]  It was by design.
[00:54:45.557 --> 00:54:47.758]  But what are we going to do with this?
[00:54:47.838 --> 00:54:53.620]  How is this going to be different from just the general anger that people have when you've got this behind you in the documentation?
[00:54:55.422 --> 00:54:56.443]  That's a perfect question.
[00:54:56.483 --> 00:54:57.144]  Here's the answer.
[00:54:57.204 --> 00:55:02.488]  The answer is we have a jurisdictional basis when the American people come together and sign the petition.
[00:55:02.548 --> 00:55:08.373]  As registered voters in this country, we have the jurisdictional basis to force this to happen.
[00:55:08.873 --> 00:55:12.396]  It's going to be a fight, but you see, you can go to a protest.
[00:55:12.416 --> 00:55:13.878]  That's an activist act.
[00:55:14.098 --> 00:55:14.318]  Yes.
[00:55:14.338 --> 00:55:15.859]  This is an actional act.
[00:55:16.139 --> 00:55:17.260]  Yes, this is a legal act.
[00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:19.141]  Yes, this is action.
[00:55:19.262 --> 00:55:20.222]  It's legal action.
[00:55:20.602 --> 00:55:22.063]  It's not just a protest.
[00:55:22.343 --> 00:55:23.823]  It's not burning down a neighborhood.
[00:55:24.223 --> 00:55:28.765]  This is a way that people can channel their anger into a legal action.
[00:55:29.245 --> 00:55:31.246]  And of course they can sign that petition for free.
[00:55:31.286 --> 00:55:36.488]  They can get the letters for free at your website that they can send a template that they can send to their congressman.
[00:55:36.508 --> 00:55:43.691]  You've sent all this information to all the congressmen and senators as well as all these different federal agencies that basically don't want to do anything with it.
[00:55:44.269 --> 00:55:44.930]  That's correct.
[00:55:44.970 --> 00:56:04.623]  In addition, we're collecting a lot of the evidence, which I am certain, and best that we not, David, go into too much detail on this, but a lot of the information and evidence which these individual congressmen and senators by name would rather not have come public.
[00:56:05.304 --> 00:56:07.986]  So we're preparing for an all-out
[00:56:08.783 --> 00:56:25.312]  Constitutionally republic-based, peaceful, jurisdictionally empowered action against them and we will disclose all the information that we have if they try to push back, cover up, or don't give us the hearing.
[00:56:25.793 --> 00:56:32.977]  That means that all the congressmen and the senators are going to have to go back to their districts and face their constituents.
[00:56:33.499 --> 00:56:41.664]  Well, that's key, and one of the things I think is when some of these people see that they're facing jail because of tax evasion, security frauds, once they see that, I think they're going to start singing.
[00:56:41.724 --> 00:56:45.646]  That's going to start the dominoes in effect, and I think a lot of people are going to start singing with that.
[00:56:46.107 --> 00:56:51.670]  Thank you so much, Greg Morse, for your research, for getting in touch with us, letting us know what you're doing with this.
[00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:58.554]  I think this is something that people can get involved with, that they can take legal action with, and not just voice their frustration.
[00:56:59.114 --> 00:56:59.695]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:00.135 --> 00:57:01.256]  David, thank you very much.
[00:57:01.576 --> 00:57:01.796]  Bye-bye.
[00:57:02.136 --> 00:57:03.557]  And again, I want to thank J.D.
