[00:00:09.153 --> 00:00:16.860]  As viewers and listeners of this radio show know, a lot of my predictions, unfortunately, are coming true.
[00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:19.622]  And it's not because I had a crystal ball.
[00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:32.294]  It's because the social engineers that control this planet to a great extent have been open about the social engineering that they are engaged in.
[00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:46.376]  They have been extremely honest about their plans to create a totally controlled society where humans basically operate and act like biological androids.
[00:00:46.857 --> 00:00:53.262]  Synthetic reality to bring synthetic consciousness that is no form of consciousness at all.
[00:00:53.742 --> 00:00:55.263]  Now, I'm not against technology.
[00:00:55.683 --> 00:01:01.788]  Technology's been neutral for thousands of years, whether it was the wheel or before that fire.
[00:01:02.987 --> 00:01:05.889]  A sword can be used for good, it can be used for bad.
[00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.951]  A butcher knife can be used for good or bad.
[00:01:09.612 --> 00:01:11.073]  So I'm not anti-technology.
[00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:19.019]  But in the last hundred years, most Western technology has been developed and deployed for social engineering
[00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:20.548]  All right.
[00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:42.704]  Be able to predict the future and fix markets.
[00:01:42.804 --> 00:01:51.326]  This is the dream of the monopoly capitalists who are the opposite of free market capitalists that all free peoples continually wage war against.
[00:01:51.726 --> 00:02:00.128]  It was the globalist Carol Quigley at Georgetown that famously said they'll work with fascists, socialists, communists or just dictators as long as it's centralized.
[00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:02.108]  They don't like freedom.
[00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:08.070]  They want to have controlled markets so they can dominate the future of the species.
[00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.512]  And you've seen how they've been the prime drivers and authors of most of our woes.
[00:02:13.393 --> 00:02:32.444]  Now, I wanted to start doing a feature here on the show once a week, every two weeks or so, sometimes maybe once a month, it'll vary, where we go back into the archive and pull up some of the things that I said a year ago, or two years ago, or five years ago, or 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[00:02:35.012 --> 00:02:42.719]  And that's the case from 1997, almost 17 years ago.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:59.953]  I wanted to illustrate that biometrics were being put in at driver's license facilities to bring in a unified federal national ID card to set up domestic checkpoints on highways and at airports to bring in an internal police system.
[00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:05.355]  That is now being deployed at airports, part of Trusted Traveler, where you opt into it.
[00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.755]  Soon it will be mandatory.
[00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:08.876]  It's used to track everywhere you go.
[00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:14.237]  If you're not a good globalist, they turn your thumbprint off and you can not buy or sell anymore.
[00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:17.758]  That's why they're trying to get rid of farmers markets, kids selling lemonade.
[00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:22.339]  They want you only going to big box stores that are going to be part of this control grid.
[00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.860]  And so now, 17 years later,
[00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:36.716]  We see states like Virginia and the District of Columbia, by Virginia, saying we want to make you do a drug test and give urine or blood to get a driver's license.
[00:03:37.277 --> 00:03:38.358]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:43.001]  Exactly what Bill Clinton put down in an executive order back in 1996.
[00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:49.245]  Now they never fully realized all that, but it shows us where they wanted to go.
[00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:54.286]  And most of what they wanted to do back then has now actually happened.
[00:03:54.907 --> 00:04:12.473]  So I wanted to play from my first film, America Destroyed by Design, something that is quite famous on the internet, but still a lot of people don't know about it, my arrest for illustrating that biometrics was coming as a dehumanizing control system.
[00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:19.937]  The police officer, the state police officer that arrested me later apologized to me years later and said he knows that I'm right.
[00:04:20.377 --> 00:04:21.818]  This is a system of total control.
[00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:25.979]  I ran into him down at the Capitol years later at a demonstration there.
[00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:31.221]  Face scanning technology is going to be used to totally control every aspect of our life.
[00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:32.482]  It's rolling out.
[00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:36.584]  They want web IDs where you'll get on the Internet with a face scan or a thumb print.
[00:04:36.924 --> 00:04:38.205]  Microsoft admits that.
[00:04:38.265 --> 00:04:39.245]  Facebook admits that.
[00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:41.006]  And then three strikes, you're out.
[00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:42.647]  No judge, no jury, no indictment.
[00:04:42.988 --> 00:04:51.693]  If big companies say you've done something wrong on the Internet three times, like the YouTube model, you are then banned off of the Internet.
[00:04:52.273 --> 00:05:08.125]  That's what Google's doing, trying to get that database, making you give them your cell phone, your home phone, your IDs, with your Google ID tied to your email and your YouTube, and to your Google Wallet, so when you're not a good globalist, you can just be turned off.
[00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:16.932]  This is the type of system that would make Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, or Mao Tse Tung have a literal wet dream.
[00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:23.138]  This is the Trojan horse tools that are completely enslaving our society.
[00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:24.559]  Just look at some of these headlines.
[00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.083]  Obama administration launches plan to make internet ID a reality.
[00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:35.146]  To tax you, to track you, to turn you off, if they don't want to.
[00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:39.589]  With all of their illegal spying, which they denied for decades, which they now admit.
[00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:45.482]  Facebook, Walmart set sights on face scanning to buy and to sell.
[00:05:45.662 --> 00:05:51.763]  South China Morning Post, Facebook, Apple to help draft face scanning rules amid privacy fears.
[00:05:52.204 --> 00:05:55.084]  Nightclub goes for face scanning security.
[00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:56.725]  This is happening in Texas.
[00:05:56.805 --> 00:05:58.385]  It's happening in Melbourne, Australia.
[00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:00.085]  It's a global grid.
[00:06:01.206 --> 00:06:02.466]  Oh, you had five beers today.
[00:06:02.506 --> 00:06:03.166]  The police know.
[00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:06.367]  They're hooked in to the face scanner at the bar.
[00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:12.878]  They're trying to force locals to wire their security cameras in by law in New York and other states to this.
[00:06:12.918 --> 00:06:17.141]  It's a global technocracy grid run by the globalists who are bad people.
[00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:19.022]  This could be human empowering.
[00:06:19.602 --> 00:06:26.526]  The problem is it's being designed and deployed and rolled out from the beginning from an authoritarian bent, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:31.334]  Another article, White House wants Chinese style ID system for internet users.
[00:06:31.814 --> 00:06:35.897]  Again, off face scanning and thumb printing to control and track everything you do.
[00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:39.079]  Vehicle miles traveling tax proposed.
[00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:41.921]  Guess what's already in all the cars universally worldwide?
[00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:49.046]  From Japan to the US, the satellite tracker box hooked into a cell phone in the belly of your car to tax you by the mile.
[00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:52.503]  See how everything I predicted is coming?
[00:06:52.523 --> 00:06:53.684]  Because I didn't predict it.
[00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:59.430]  The globalists at MIT admitted all this when I was warning people back in the mid-1990s.
[00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:04.275]  Biometric security being promoted as if the public wants it.
[00:07:04.615 --> 00:07:09.040]  Oh, biometric security can't come soon enough for some people is the headline.
[00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:13.093]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:07:13.373 --> 00:07:17.656]  The idea that won't die out, taxing cars with a mile, is back on the agenda.
[00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:19.778]  And they have the boxes in the cars.
[00:07:20.118 --> 00:07:20.719]  Take a peek.
[00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.442]  Biometric security offers relief from passwords.
[00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:25.002]  That's right.
[00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:33.989]  Oh, the government releases the passwords, the government releases the worms and the viruses that break in and steal your password and give it to hackers.
[00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:35.676]  That's been in the news.
[00:07:36.116 --> 00:07:45.386]  Show that they discredit passwords and force you to go to a thumbprint, an iris scan, which that imprint can just as easily be stolen.
[00:07:45.846 --> 00:07:49.330]  All it is is a list of digital numbers or a digital algorithm.
[00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:55.836]  It's even easier to defraud the thumbprint or the eye scan because you can't ever change that password.
[00:07:56.497 --> 00:07:59.318]  And that's all been proven to be a fraud as well.
[00:07:59.798 --> 00:08:00.379]  Here's another one.
[00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:04.180]  DHS to test face scanning cameras at Tri-City Hockey Game.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:11.163]  Again, with checkpoints and people searching you at the checkpoints, supposedly because of Al-Qaeda.
[00:08:12.243 --> 00:08:18.986]  And other groups that they publicly arm, fund, and run in Syria, Libya, Iraq, and other areas.
[00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:34.694]  Again, a criminal technocracy creating crises or exacerbating crises, like Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff famously said, now the Chicago mob boss in Don, they don't want to let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:08:35.374 --> 00:08:37.655]  You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.
[00:08:38.865 --> 00:08:42.907]  And what I mean by that, it's an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.
[00:08:43.807 --> 00:08:46.569]  Again, it's not that technology's bad.
[00:08:47.289 --> 00:08:53.892]  Our technology has been developed and deployed for a hundred years to carry out dehumanization, to carry out eugenics.
[00:08:54.312 --> 00:08:55.673]  Look at who founded IBM.
[00:08:55.773 --> 00:08:57.074]  Top Nazi, Thomas Watson.
[00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.799]  Look at who runs all these systems.
[00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:01.419]  Find out who Bill and Melinda Gates are.
[00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:03.620]  Find out about their own statements, Warren Buffett.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.621]  Then you'll understand why the technology is driving in this direction.
[00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:14.043]  Because these people believe they're going to merge with the machines and become God, as Ray Kurzweil, the head of Google Technology, has said.
[00:09:15.563 --> 00:09:22.588]  Let's go ahead and now go back to 1997, where I got arrested to draw attention.
[00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:30.194]  You know, some fools out there say, Alex, you got fingerprinted, you got arrested, ah-ha-ha, you were trying to get around fingerprinting.
[00:09:30.234 --> 00:09:32.156]  No, I wasn't trying to get around fingerprinting.
[00:09:32.476 --> 00:09:35.779]  I wasn't putting super glue on my thumb to fool the biometrics.
[00:09:36.499 --> 00:09:42.464]  I was trying to stop the collection of biometrics and the national ID card to begin with.
[00:09:43.832 --> 00:09:48.155]  I was warning about things they wouldn't even admit existed at the time.
[00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:55.461]  And we did succeed in raising public awareness to where we now have a good shot of changing all of this today.
[00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:58.243]  Alright, enough from Alex Jones in 2014.
[00:10:00.145 --> 00:10:01.926]  Let's go back to 1997.
[00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:09.232]  And then we'll come back to the future and David Knight after this time capsule.
[00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:11.754]  Alright, they're ready for me.
[00:10:11.814 --> 00:10:12.234]  Let's go.
[00:10:12.254 --> 00:10:13.535]  Come over and get the pretty little red light.
[00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:14.982]  Come on.
[00:10:15.042 --> 00:10:15.843]  Isn't that pretty?
[00:10:16.204 --> 00:10:20.089]  And they'll put a nice little clinic in here in the next few years for urine and blood testing like Clinton wants.
[00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:21.371]  What do I have to hide?
[00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:21.911]  I'm a criminal.
[00:10:22.492 --> 00:10:22.953]  There we have it.
[00:10:22.973 --> 00:10:24.354]  Nice little pretty red lie.
[00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:25.336]  Get that, Mike.
[00:10:25.516 --> 00:10:26.317]  There we have it.
[00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:30.602]  I am here with eight forms of identification.
[00:10:52.868 --> 00:10:53.889]  I have my passport.
[00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:56.009]  Here is that, my name, and the form you asked me to fill out.
[00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.590]  I have no criminal record.
[00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.351]  My name is Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:00.751]  Here is my passport.
[00:11:02.032 --> 00:11:03.433]  Here is my insurance.
[00:11:04.273 --> 00:11:05.714]  Here is another form of ID.
[00:11:06.354 --> 00:11:07.834]  Here is my old driver's license.
[00:11:08.295 --> 00:11:09.655]  Here is my birth certificate.
[00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:11.416]  And here is my W-2 form.
[00:11:12.273 --> 00:11:15.115]  And here is two more insurance cards, all the ones, just so you can double check.
[00:11:15.135 --> 00:11:16.316]  This is a health club card.
[00:11:16.336 --> 00:11:17.297]  You've got a clear ID.
[00:11:17.317 --> 00:11:17.798]  You're good to go.
[00:11:17.818 --> 00:11:19.099]  We're going to get you to the door right now.
[00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:20.720]  I just need for you to answer these first three questions.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.682]  Take a look at these questions there and go over them.
[00:11:22.762 --> 00:11:23.803]  So I don't have to thumb scan?
[00:11:24.203 --> 00:11:25.104]  Well, we're going to get to that.
[00:11:25.364 --> 00:11:26.665]  You are eventually going to have to.
[00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:27.165]  Yes, sir.
[00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:28.707]  But not now.
[00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:29.707]  Not at this point.
[00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:32.049]  But you will before we're done with the process.
[00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:32.690]  Why?
[00:11:34.588 --> 00:11:36.069]  It's required by Bill Clinton in 1992.
[00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:38.990]  And it was instituted here in Texas in 1993.
[00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:39.950]  I know the code, sir.
[00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.611]  Are you going to institute his urine and blood testing when he commands you?
[00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:45.733]  Are you going to stick a needle in my arm when I have no criminal record?
[00:11:45.953 --> 00:11:50.355]  The only questions I'm going to answer right now are concerning driver's license issuance.
[00:11:51.175 --> 00:11:52.435]  You just follow orders, don't you?
[00:11:52.896 --> 00:12:00.739]  So you're saying you're going to deny me the constitutional right to travel if I do not submit to this digital thumb scanning.
[00:12:02.273 --> 00:12:07.379]  What I will tell you, today you will not receive a duplicate driver's license if you do not submit to a thumb print.
[00:12:07.439 --> 00:12:07.759]  Okay.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.562]  Look, I feel like I'm being raped here.
[00:12:09.842 --> 00:12:13.326]  Well, I would sit down with you for hours and try to do what I could to help you.
[00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:15.969]  Then just give me my license without digitally thumb scanning.
[00:12:16.109 --> 00:12:18.071]  I am not going to violate DPS policy.
[00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:19.293]  Is there a religious exception?
[00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:20.354]  For your exception.
[00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:21.916]  Is there a religious exception?
[00:12:24.319 --> 00:12:25.540]  Everyone must take the mark.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.120]  A digitally enhanced mark.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.721]  A digital tattoo.
[00:12:34.442 --> 00:12:34.942]  I'm good to go.
[00:12:35.002 --> 00:12:38.343]  Why do you need my thumbprint?
[00:12:38.843 --> 00:12:40.183]  It's part of Bill Clinton's law, isn't it?
[00:12:40.623 --> 00:12:41.744]  It's an executive order.
[00:12:42.264 --> 00:12:44.584]  It's a decree by Bill Clinton.
[00:12:44.644 --> 00:12:44.804]  NCIC.
[00:12:48.025 --> 00:12:51.450]  Yeah, and if I drive without a license, what's the penalties for driving without a license?
[00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.752]  You know, I don't even want to go there.
[00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:53.453]  That's right.
[00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:54.294]  You know why?
[00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:54.875]  I'm asking you.
[00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:55.797]  It doesn't pertain to it.
[00:12:55.897 --> 00:12:56.437]  You're an officer.
[00:12:56.477 --> 00:12:57.339]  I'm asking you the law.
[00:12:57.759 --> 00:12:59.101]  I would be glad to sit down with an officer.
[00:12:59.121 --> 00:13:02.206]  So you're saying I'll be committing a crime by driving if I don't take your mark?
[00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:06.074]  I would be glad to do anything I can to help you, sir.
[00:13:06.214 --> 00:13:14.063]  Well, see, you're saying... I'm not against you, and I understand... Officer Ard, you're sitting here, Sergeant, and telling me that you're all friendly and you're all nice.
[00:13:14.564 --> 00:13:16.186]  But I'll be pulled over and given tickets.
[00:13:16.226 --> 00:13:22.874]  If I don't pay those, I will go to jail because I... because of my morals and my beliefs, I will not take this.
[00:13:23.434 --> 00:13:28.257]  And I'm here to tell you, I already took this in 93, and many people will say, well, you've already taken it, what's your problem with it?
[00:13:28.437 --> 00:13:35.100]  Because now I've figured out what this is, and I'm opposing all those others that are being herded in here like cattle to be thumb scanned like criminals.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.661]  Mr. Jones?
[00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:35.901]  Yes?
[00:13:36.721 --> 00:13:37.962]  We don't even need to start there.
[00:13:37.982 --> 00:13:41.104]  If I know that you're not going to submit to a thumb print, why waste your time?
[00:13:41.144 --> 00:13:41.364]  See?
[00:13:41.464 --> 00:13:42.104]  Right up front.
[00:13:42.584 --> 00:13:45.326]  They will drop, and people are being turned away all day here.
[00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:49.488]  So you're saying I pay my taxes, I'm raped by the IRS, which is criminal.
[00:13:49.928 --> 00:13:50.949]  You know, it's well known.
[00:13:52.538 --> 00:13:52.978]  Submit.
[00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.539]  He just said I must submit.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.241]  I'm telling you, I've never been to jail.
[00:13:57.261 --> 00:13:59.043]  I don't know, what do you want me to do for you?
[00:13:59.243 --> 00:14:01.004]  I want you to give me my driver's license.
[00:14:01.684 --> 00:14:03.125]  I want my driver's license.
[00:14:03.265 --> 00:14:03.926]  I am not a criminal.
[00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:05.927]  I may become one today, but that's fine.
[00:14:06.227 --> 00:14:09.309]  You're saying you won't take me to jail at 5 if I'm still here.
[00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.051]  No, we're not going to take you to jail.
[00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:11.991]  Oh yeah.
[00:14:12.712 --> 00:14:15.133]  This is against the grain of the Constitution.
[00:14:15.294 --> 00:14:17.215]  Look, if I don't take the mark,
[00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:19.420]  My right to travel is taken.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.402]  You're taking my rights and telling me that it's no big deal?
[00:14:22.842 --> 00:14:24.123]  And now you want a urine and blood test.
[00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:26.184]  Bring me the document.
[00:14:26.785 --> 00:14:28.406]  Who has the urine and blood testing document?
[00:14:28.866 --> 00:14:29.226]  I need it.
[00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:30.827]  I'm going to pass these out to people.
[00:14:31.868 --> 00:14:34.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Federal Register.
[00:14:34.489 --> 00:14:35.330]  Bill Clinton.
[00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.471]  Urine and blood testing plan for you.
[00:14:37.791 --> 00:14:38.872]  Tell your friends about it.
[00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.693]  We have got to stand against this.
[00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:43.275]  The states are preparing to implement this plan.
[00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:44.776]  This is not a joke.
[00:14:44.816 --> 00:14:46.017]  This is not the entire document.
[00:14:46.037 --> 00:14:46.597]  It gets worse.
[00:14:47.432 --> 00:14:51.395]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, it's a joke to them.
[00:14:54.057 --> 00:14:55.498]  Only Coach Pinders matters.
[00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:57.980]  Only diversions like Rome, the Gladiators.
[00:14:58.661 --> 00:15:02.644]  If I don't take this, if I don't take this, will I not?
[00:15:03.473 --> 00:15:10.015]  Be penalized for not having a driver's license, by not being able to cash a check, by being given tickets that if I don't pay those tickets, I'll be taken to jail.
[00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.136]  I can't travel out of state.
[00:15:11.376 --> 00:15:12.636]  I can't get on board an airplane.
[00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:15.257]  And the media is talking about thumb scanning to travel.
[00:15:15.717 --> 00:15:18.598]  You're working with the foreign banks and the military industrial complex.
[00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:19.619]  This is all their idea.
[00:15:19.859 --> 00:15:21.199]  Read the Military War College from 1968.
[00:15:21.239 --> 00:15:21.679]  They planned this!
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.443]  Just because you lay around doesn't mean it's not true.
[00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:28.445]  This is not a publicity stunt.
[00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:31.849]  I was a lot happier years ago before I got into all this garbage.
[00:15:32.109 --> 00:15:33.390]  I'm sick of sheep laying down.
[00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.052]  I wish you'd get up and do something.
[00:15:35.753 --> 00:15:36.714]  Makes me want to vomit!
[00:15:38.178 --> 00:15:44.044]  Our forefathers went to World War II and World War I and fought in the Civil War to end slavery and it means nothing to y'all.
[00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:46.246]  We're a bunch of yellow-bellied weaklings.
[00:15:46.906 --> 00:15:47.727]  I'm sick of it.
[00:15:48.328 --> 00:15:53.633]  I'm sick of people laying down like a bunch of jellyfish and rationalizing what's going on.
[00:15:53.873 --> 00:15:55.354]  People ought to be ashamed of themselves.
[00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.355]  Yes, exactly.
[00:16:00.854 --> 00:16:03.476]  Now look very carefully at Mike Cox.
[00:16:03.756 --> 00:16:07.959]  He is head public information officer for all of Texas for the DPS.
[00:16:08.439 --> 00:16:14.764]  They weren't going to arrest me, but about 15 minutes into the protest he showed up and things changed dramatically.
[00:16:14.804 --> 00:16:18.747]  He walked up, stared at me, turned, walked back to the back.
[00:16:18.787 --> 00:16:21.469]  They had a little meeting together and then they came and arrested me.
[00:16:22.307 --> 00:16:22.567]  Yeah, right.
[00:16:22.587 --> 00:16:24.889]  If you don't leave now, I will be forced to arrest you.
[00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:26.330]  Sir, I'm here to get a driver's license.
[00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.551]  I have never had a criminal record.
[00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:28.551]  It's time to go.
[00:16:28.591 --> 00:16:28.952]  Here I go.
[00:16:29.132 --> 00:16:29.792]  Get my stuff for me.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:43.861]  Yes, sir.
[00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:46.283]  You're doing a good job.
[00:16:46.623 --> 00:16:50.728]  I guess that makes you a mercenary, huh?
[00:16:50.768 --> 00:16:52.309]  Cave mercenaries, huh?
[00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:06.003]  Yeah, he's got his black gloves on.
[00:17:06.023 --> 00:17:07.784]  I guess that makes him tough.
[00:17:07.864 --> 00:17:11.427]  I guess that makes him look like a real well-paid person there.
[00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:12.148]  Where's Alex?
[00:17:12.188 --> 00:17:13.008]  Where's Alex?
[00:17:13.048 --> 00:17:15.430]  He has to do a show tonight!
[00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.491]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:16.751]  Hey!
[00:17:16.871 --> 00:17:19.614]  Yeah, they're pushing everybody.
[00:17:19.654 --> 00:17:21.275]  They're pushing it.
[00:17:21.335 --> 00:17:23.217]  He's getting ridiculous here.
[00:17:23.277 --> 00:17:23.917]  Where's Alex?
[00:17:23.937 --> 00:17:28.681]  I thought my tax dollars paid for this building.
[00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:31.183]  Yeah, he's got it.
[00:17:31.203 --> 00:17:32.104]  Come on, Alex.
[00:17:37.238 --> 00:17:41.080]  The DPS was very professional, but they did the classic bait and switch.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.342]  They got all the troopers on one side of the building and made us think that I was coming out there.
[00:17:45.362 --> 00:17:57.929]  I hope we've painted you a picture of what's really happening here in the nation.
[00:17:58.866 --> 00:18:04.072]  I got out of jail that night with a Class C misdemeanor and I'm taking it to court and I'm sure I'll defeat it with a jury trial.
[00:18:04.092 --> 00:18:08.577]  It was a small price to pay though to bring light upon the biometric technologies.
[00:18:18.717 --> 00:18:26.580]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.900]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.701]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:18:31.761 --> 00:18:35.883]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:18:36.183 --> 00:18:39.344]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:18:39.364 --> 00:18:46.626]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:18:46.826 --> 00:18:50.949]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:18:51.129 --> 00:18:52.771]  We are the true media.
[00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:55.553]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:59.296]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
