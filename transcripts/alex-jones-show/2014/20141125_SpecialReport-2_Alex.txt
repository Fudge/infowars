[00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.372]  I've been in business out here 22 years.
[00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:11.972]  Oh my god.
[00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:15.315]  Oh wow.
[00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:21.138]  She said she took her boards down to try to trust in the people here that no one would rob her store.
[00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:24.140]  And as you can see right here, the windows are busted out.
[00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:29.184]  And it's just another business.
[00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:29.704]  It's just sad.
[00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.879]  Did she witness the looters?
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.540]  No, she just showed up.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.441]  She came out here to check to see if anything had happened.
[00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:39.342]  I'm so sorry for her.
[00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:40.302]  Can you get her on camera?
[00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:43.603]  Does she want to talk?
[00:00:44.603 --> 00:00:47.584]  No, she's trying to... She's assessing the damage it looks like.
[00:00:47.644 --> 00:00:49.845]  And she obviously lives in the area.
[00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:51.885]  Yeah, she does.
[00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:53.726]  She said she's been here 22 years.
[00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:54.166]  God.
[00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.607]  And she said she purposely brought the boards down because she thought she could
[00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:01.406]  You know, just put her faith in the community that nothing would happen.
[00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:05.909]  Well, as you guys... I don't know that it was the community that destroyed her building, though.
[00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.190]  That's the sad thing about it.
[00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.514]  Here's a black lady, a small business person, an entrepreneur who has worked hard to build her business for 22 years.
[00:01:14.914 --> 00:01:21.758]  All she'll get back from the insurance company is going to be some compensation for what was damaged and so on, but she's not going to have her income replaced.
[00:01:21.878 --> 00:01:22.139]  Right.
[00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.140]  It looks like the fire department is completely pulled out.
[00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:25.921]  They've even left
[00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:28.168]  Uh, this building to go.
[00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.910]  I don't know if it's completely out, but it's smoldering.
[00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.291]  Um, this is right here.
[00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:34.532]  We're coming up on the McDonald's.
[00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:38.914]  So I guess they've been ordered out of the area completely since they have no way to defend themselves.
[00:01:39.194 --> 00:01:39.555]  Whoa.
[00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:41.196]  I just saw something explode inside.
[00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:41.896]  Yeah.
[00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:44.177]  Probably a gas canister or something.
[00:01:44.678 --> 00:01:45.158]  Look at that.
[00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:46.479]  Is that Jakari's feed?
[00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:47.419]  Yeah.
[00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:48.820]  Well, Jakari's in front of me.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.481]  Yeah, it is.
[00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:51.081]  It's called Beauty Town.
[00:01:51.342 --> 00:01:51.642]  Yeah.
[00:01:52.843 --> 00:01:54.323]  Uh, it's no longer beautiful.
[00:01:55.144 --> 00:01:55.264]  Hmm.
[00:01:57.963 --> 00:01:58.564]  It's really sad.
[00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:00.365]  I can't.
[00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:01.446]  Wow.
[00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:07.649]  I mean, tomorrow the footage is just gonna be... I mean, it's not even gonna look the same again, ever.
[00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.271]  You're saying a lot of people's lives are destroyed.
[00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:24.160]  I mean, you gotta understand how many people save to start businesses like this, and work hard, and it's the productive people in the community that are trying to build a business and put something back in the community, and to see
[00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.962]  The citizens react this way, or whoever it is is doing it.
[00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:34.637]  I mean, that's just gotta hurt someone who's just sacrificed and tried to do what they can to help out around this area.
[00:02:34.657 --> 00:02:35.559]  It's just, wow.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.520]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
